Agent "JJ" received a call from his boss. Can you accept this mission or not? I'm interested, I accept. Here. It may be necessary. And remember the password. I will do my duty. This story takes place after the event in London. Each murder is the story of a meeting. Each meeting is a love story. When a concurrence of exceptionally terrible events takes place, there also occurs the liberation of these events after a long repression during years of peace and good fortune. Famous people affirm that the true spirit of human nature emerges from these events. On the other hand it is obvious that... The bags are packed. I'm leaving. Stay if you wish and give your lecture, but i'm leaving. Did you hear me? Have you nothing to say to me? Goodbye. Concretely...I propose to speak to you, about the reciprocal attraction between the killer and his victim. I have made a careful survey of several centuries of horror literature, and I can assure you that from Iphigenia to Maralin, and from Ophelia to Desdemona, the victim responds to a natural vulnerability, which requires that exterminating violence will become the only solution. Because, fatally, it is the conscience of these people, conditioned to the future, and given all the possibilities before them, only one, that which best accords with the nature of a being both delicate and accused, distinct and naked. A person whose beauty everyone wishes to either possess or destroy. When we are awake, we all live in the same world, but when we dream, each lives in his own. I keep these dolls because inside them lies the enchanted poetry of the past, where the imagination was recalled in little things, and did not invent dreams. Have you heard of Phregori? He was the last quick-change artist, and the greatest. But his trade has died. Phregori was the creator of an intimate universe, which others could only try to understand. But without success, since the poetic meaning can never have real meaning for the masses. It is important that his memory lives on, and all of these objects are a silent testimony that such men existed. The worlds created by these fantasies and spirits still exist. A show in which nothing happens, is a show in which everything happens within. In this manner we preserve the right to continue dreaming. This is poetry. I don't think I'm going. What? What did she say? I'm staying. I've thought about it, and I'm staying. Now she says she's not going. Did you hear? She says she's not going. She's not going... Miss... I can't sleep because I keep thinking of you. Is he bothering you? Should I accompany you? Get in my car. You need protection and I understand that. Everyone is a little on edge, it's natural. But I can take you where you want. To Liverpool? Copenhagen? Hamburg? You're going to need me! I'll await your call for an hour. If you want to reach me call 224-31-53. We repeat. Excessive luggage is not recommended. If possible, luggage should be no larger than a handbag for an airplane. You should have with you personal documents, and only the other necessary, elemental items required by each individual. For example, each person may take with him certain necessities, such as a toothbrush, toothpaste, a shaving razor - preferably not electric, shoes in good repair, a nylon shirt, two pairs of nylon socks, a nylon undershirt, a small sewing kit, one sweater. Miss...Hey, Miss! What are you doing by yourself? Do you mind if I talk to you for a minute? Wait a minute. Why are you running? Nothing will happen if you stop. We could talk about many things. Don't misinterpret my words. I only want to help you. Why didn't you go? I don't know. Suddenly everything seemed futile. I''ll castle. How to I castle? You want to castle? Yes. Isn't it a good time? The rook here, and the king here. Now i'm more at ease. The king is holed up in his castle. A chessboard has no place for dreams. Though it would be fun to think so. It's a distressing game, isn't it? Why? Nothing is left to chance. Whoever wins the game of chess, loses all others. Well, not always. I like to hear you laugh. This morning, I discovered that the tires of my car were punctured. With a razor. Why? What do they want of me? Why do I always lose at chess? It's normal that people are on edge. Is she sleeping? Resting. I understand. She only arrived from London two days ago. But...What does she say? How did she save herself? How did he die? That's only part of the question. I'm hoping she'll be able to forget. That we'll all forget. Let's quit. Not a chance. I won't let you. She's finally on my side. Maybe you would have won. Let's play again. We'll see if you enjoy yourself. It's important that you enjoy this. I think you'll enjoy it. It's Miriam. I was telling Gim that you are an actress working with Robert Mitchum. Right? Gim wants to see the art chamber. What do you say? I heard that they wrecked the car. Things like that always happen to me. Of course. They happen because you accept them. I, on the other hand, am Pisces. Nothing ever happens to Pisces. I believe that it's all related to your sign. What day were you born? I don't believe in the stars. The stars are still there. Jerry was also Pisces. Miriam spends hours staring at it. Right Miriam? Yes. It's cold. It's frigidity is secondary. I like it. It's soft, but it doesn't do anything. This is useful. And it never stops. Never. Like people who eternally live the same day over again. Alvaro, I want to speak to you alone. Excuse me. Can I help you? May I? Let me do this. Your beauty is everything? You think this is justice? What kind of special rights do you think you have? You think you're privileged? Now he is dreaming. About whom? Do you know? No one knows. About you. And if he stops dreaming, what will happen to you? I don't know. You''ll disappear. You're a character in his dream. If he awakes, you'll disappear like the flicker of a candle. That's horrible. I can't stand it. Put away the sunglasses, but hold up the bottle so that the camera can focus on it. Miss, do you believe in premonitions? I will believe in nothing until later. And if later there is no opportunity to believe? Then all the better to have no beliefs. Wait a moment. Don't move. Say something, anything. I don't know. I don't remember anything. Nothing? To be or not to be. That is the question. Excellent. Go on. To be or not to be. That is the question. I don't remember the rest. Go on anyway. To be or not to be. That is the question. Which is better: Resigning ourselves to utter collapse, or attempting to change things even though in reality we know that nothing can change. And if we could change? To die. To sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream. But I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Very good. Very good. Is that enough? Repeat just the last sentence, "I don't want to die", but this time while smiling. I don't want to die. Perfect. See you tomorrow at the same time. Are you staying? I never go. Miss! Miss! Miss! Be so kind as to tell me the time. I'm sorry. I don't have a watch. Thank you, Miss. Thank you. Thank you... Thank you... Hello? Hello? Alvaro. I want to see you right away. Something very unpleasant just happened. I'm very frightened. Don't talk nonsense. Please, Alvaro. I''ll wait for you at home. You"ll come, right? Alright. Calm yourself. I'm leaving. She calls. You leave. Who's there? Me. Let's see. What happened? Forgive me. I'm very frightened. We're all frightened. This afternoon a blind man told me something awful. A blind man? What did this blind man tell you? I'm going to die. Who? Him? No. Me. We all die in the end, right? He said I was going to die. Today. Murdered. Come on, Gim. Enough. What you're saying to me is childish nonsense. Being murdered is childish nonsense? Having fear of being murdered is nonsense. That man hates me. Everyone hates me. The ones who punctured the tires of my car also. You're mistaken. They don't hate you. They desire you. You don't hate me either? What? You desire me too? I love you. That's not true. Why should you love me? Why shouldn't I love you? I will love you if you want it. You've got it wrong, Alvaro. You don't understand. I need you. Alright. If you're interested in knowing something, if you can imagine this, if this is helpful at all, let me just say that I've always been in love with you. I don't love you, but I need you. To defend you from blind men and sharks? Yes. No. I don't know. I'm afraid, Alvaro. I love you and I want to go away with you. Far from this city. I want to be with you. Alright, alright. Right away, as soon as possible. Calm yourself. Will you take me with you? Tell me you'll take me with you. What are you doing here? I told you I'd be right back. Why did you follow me? You told her everything! You were talking about me! Calm yourself. Take it easy. I'm sorry. I must go to her. Silence! Please. The lecture is about to start. Each murder is the story of a meeting. Each meeting is a love story. I will examine the reciprocal attraction between the killer and his victim, and the interesting role in the meeting that is played by some photographers. I will also discuss the victim of the famous Phregori, King Kong, and the strange inverse process which would not have been possible without the intervention of a camera. I would now like to show you several slides which will aid us in understanding the way in which victims possess certain personality characteristics that allow them to be recognized, and permits their subsequent re-education, and their re-integration in a society of probable murderers. I have carefully selected the following photographs, for their portrayal of distinct victim characteristics. These are beings whose natural vulnerability renders futile any self-defense, and who invite upon them a violent crime. Because, it is the conscience of these people, conditioned to the future, and given all the possibilities before them, only one, that which best accords with the nature of a being both delicate and accused, distinct and naked. A person whose beauty everyone's wish is either to possess or destroy. Here, ladies and gentlemen, we have the photograph of Ursula Alejandra Aviexa, murdered in 1965. To this day the identity of the murderer is unknown. And the body of the victim was never found. Nevertheless, the crime was witnessed by a number of people, one of whom took these striking photographs with a telephoto lens, which were then widely published around the world. These images represent the horror collection, of a murderer-fetishist. And yet, not one of these photos would be in front of you today, if those women had not consciously elected ahead of time to die. It is only with a desire for death that we cut short our existence. And this desire for death is the result of fear. Fear is the element that allows an entire city, an entire country, to transform itself into a victim. For the woman you see here, it will be enough that her soft and appealing face, will attract and fascinate others. What I am showing you is a murder that has not yet been committed. Everything is conventional, but the elements are real. I will challenge you to refuse that those images record, either what has already transpired, or what has not yet transpired. You're crazy. I had to come. You're an imbecile. I had to complete my duty. This duty is your business. You're an idiot. But you're here too. I'm also nuts. I was in London. Look at this condition I'm in. Do you remember the sign? The almond flower of the ninth of March. Not that one. The other one. I don't remember. Listen to me. The scorpions of the moon fall in love ten times. It's a pity that a young man with your qualities disappoints in such a common manner. Tell me. What do you want? I'm trying to find a person. This woman is going to be murdered. Her murderer sent us this photograph. You're from the same paper your holding in your hand? Yes. And you think you're going to save that woman? Whatever happens will happen, but I must try to prevent it in any way I can. To preserve order! We must help this woman. You're being ridiculous. There's no time. I can do it. Do you know anything about the girl? Her name is Gim. She's a model. We already know that. Her killer is possibly the same person who murdered Ursula Alejandra Aviexa in 1965. This is what we assumed. The girl lives in the city. That's why I'm here. I get the sense you have no orders to be working on this, and your interest in her is purely personal. You're an imbecile. It's best that you leave the city as soon as possible. It's not even worth dealing with idiots... Just tell me where I might look for her. The city has two parts: the upper and the lower. Look in the upper. The upper part is divided in two sectors: the right and the left. Look in the left sector. There is a man called Alvaro. Where you find Alvaro, you'll find Gim. How do you know? Because Alvaro is always with Gim. Thank you. Wait! There is another possibility. You can go to the scene of the murder. At number 78 Diverti street they will know something. Thanks, many thanks. I'm sorry, Gim. I couldn't do anything about it. Forgive me. I swear to you. I'll come over right away. I need you. Ok? Miriam, are you listening? You're making a mistake. Gim is coming over. She'll tell you herself. What do you think is going on? Come on, open up. Miriam! Do you think Jerry would approve? But Jerry is already dead, right? It's not like before. Jerry will not come back this time. But if he came back, would you start things again with him? Would you start things with Gim if she showed up? I was there, but I know nothing. I saw something, but I don't remember it. All was silent. I read in a magazine that you don't like umbrellas. Do you like...or do you not like umbrellas? They surprise me. Yes, they are surprising things. I'm an optimist. I think this way of thinking can always be justified. Nothing will happen to you here. Do I set you at ease? Yes. But you're worried. You're not accustomed to this, right? You must think about things as they were. As a girl, did you come to the park to play? Sometimes. Did you play on the merry-go-round? Never. Why not play on it now? I was waiting... Waiting... Waiting awaits you...in a place that you don't want. Right? Come. Let me help you. Do you believe in flying saucers? In angels? This morning a man told me he saw an angel and a flying saucer. It was both things at the same time. The man said that out of this flying apparition there emerged a whirlwind of fire. And in the center of the whirlwind, he saw four serpents with four arms each. They shone like bronze. Over their heads he saw a shining firmament, like pieces of glass. And the flapping of their wings was like the rushing of a river. Are you listening to me, miss? The man's name was Exieres. The event took place 4000 years ago. But let us set aside this world of so long ago. Let's see about something else, seniorita, what's your opinion on General Goldfinger? Can you tell me anything about his recent marriage to the English writer Jonathon Swift? Are you for or against hospitals? I prefer the natural healing. Which horse do you pick to win? Chubasco, Angola, Milongero, Cartago or Delphin? Are you reading any new erotic novels? Only two. Are you cynical and apprehensive in regards to the consequences of the altering of dimensions? Do you believe in the advantages of multiple orgasms? Wait, I've got the question for you. What kind of music do you prefer? Which flower? Did you hear they discovered a new emotion? How many children do you have? Do they like being so ignorant? That's enough. You respond to me now. It's my turn. Tell me about yourself. Who am I? Tell me about your life. A little later, seniorita...if you don't mind. I love listening to reports on the radio. You learn so much. Their recommendations always seem correct. Very useful, in fact. What did you say? I've seen you somewhere. Everywhere, in fact. I like to see you smiling. You do it so well. But naturally, since it is your profession. My profession consists only of smiling. Laughing is much more difficult. Are you coming? Do you know how to drive? I'm a chauffeur. Sad again? What would you like to drink? What do you suggest? I suggest you try this magnificent soft drink, whose natural water will give you an instantaneous sense of well-being. But no! I assure you that this yellow beverage contains the key to permanent well-being. Not for me. And then I'll recommend these potato chips, in order to regain your thirst. You do understand the difference between depth and form, Miss? And then, I'll give you this bottle of natural juice, which is perfectly preserved via conservatives. You are the one I'm interested in. And you? What can you offer me? Just a little water, or perhaps something more. Automatically the answer is no. There are so many things you will never understand. No. I'm not talking about fish. They belong to another world. Why? Because their world is on the other side of the glass. You could become very intelligent if you had the time to. Thank you. Do you want to know more? Or are you too foolish? What are you referring to? The same thing. Are you too foolish to know? I'm offering you what you don't know. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm talking about things never suspected, things that must be learned. Understand? No! I think you do. You must show me that you understand, and that you want to know more. I'm sorry, but I... And now for the final disgrace. I'm not myself. But still, there is no reason for you to behave so stupidly. Come back! Come back! Do you know this woman? That woman? Yes, this woman? No. Is there anyone at home? In this house? Yes, in this house. No. I was told that I would find someone here. Someone who knows this woman. What woman? The woman in the photograph. I've seen the photograph. Yes, that's her. It's the girl the boys like. What boys? If you want, I'll take you to them. I don't think they are coming back. They left when the lecture started. What lecture? Someone gave a lecture? Up there. There's someone up there? Up there? Yes, up there. There is no one. I'm going up there. You can't do that without my permission. Hey! Wake up! Are you the one who gave the lecture? Quick! Answer! Was it you! This man did not give the lecture. Excuse me, but I need to know... ...a program...but I don't remember... He said he has the program. Why are you laughing? I'm not laughing. In his shoe. As always. For both of you. Wait! Don't run! You're in a hurry. Running behind? You must have something important to do. What is your name? Where are you from? What are you looking for? You're looking for something and we've just found something. Don't talk much, do you? I suggest you take our advice. What do you say we play a game? Yes, a game. -I don't have time. -You have time for this game. You know what you're going to do? He doesn't know. -You have no idea? -Look, I'm trying to find this woman. -Do you know her? Hey guys, it's Gim! The perfume girl! The ad girl! The candy girl! Don't hit me! Please. I don't have anything. Get up! Get up! Now you''ll do what I say, you hear? Hands on your head. Now run! Run! Run, but not too fast. Is that clear? One-two, one-two, one two! We're gonna stick to you. Stick to you! Wait for me! Wait! Hurry! Careful! You, over there. You, there. Let's go! He's lost. Now you'll find what you're looking for. Move it! Let's go. Get out of here. Get up here! Jump! Jump already! Now you'll get what you deserve. Take that! Watch out! Shoot him! Shoot him! Kill him! I can't! It's not loaded! And if it were? Alvaro? Alvaro? Please. I need help. A young woman wants to use the telephone. She says a crime has been committed. Oh my God... The gentleman is sick, miss. We're sorry. We have no telephone. Please, tell me at least where I am. We're sorry. We're very sorry. Please! Help me! Open up, Professor! I know you're there. I must see you. Open up! Damn it! Professor! Why are you hiding? How am I supposed to find anyone in this town? Do you hear me? I know you can hear me... Do you know this woman? Yes, I know her. She's the one who is to be murdered. By whom? Why? How? When? How do you know? Where is she? I knew someone would be coming. What is that for an answer? Come on, tell me about her. You arrived on time for our meeting but late for hers. Just as I anticipated. Come with me. We may still be able to prevent it. The crime will take place. The girl will meet her killer. Perhaps she's already met him. Maybe you're the one behind this. Don't be ridiculous. I don't kill anyone. Only perfect crimes are committed, with anonymous killers. Who are they? Impossible to say. The important thing is to find the victim. I discovered Ursula Alejandra Aviexa in 1965. I've now discovered the girl in whom you've taken this late interest. My premonitions are always proved true. You don't believe me? Then come with me. Jerry killed him. Did you see him? I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Did you see Jerry? Jerry! Jerry? My name is Carlos. Go ahead. This is Viola. Do you recognize her? It's her. Her? Who? The person you imagined. This is a bunch of nonsense. You're full of it. You mean to tell me this thing comes from a body? It could come from a body. Your premonitions are lies and this horror doesn't exist. They are lies, but the horror exists. I only want to know one thing: where is Gim? The girl is looking... ...looking for her killer. I was told to look for her here, but I'll look elsewhere. Wait. What about over there? There's only one exit! Damn you! Open up, Professor. What are you doing? Open! Let me out! Who are you? Who's there? What happened? Professor, are you there? Answer me! Is there someone there? Is there? Who are you? Why won't you open up? It's me, Jerry, it's me... Open up, please! We don't have time for this. I knew you'd come looking for me, Jerry. I knew you would. I'm not Jerry. Who are you? Don't you understand that I need to get out? You are Jerry, right Jerry? I love you. Do you love me, Jerry? Open up. I can't wait. Is the professor there? He has the key. No, Jerry, no...Now we are together. Can't you understand? Alright. I'm Jerry. Just open up. No, I won't open it...Jerry. Not if you're not Jerry. But I will have you... ...forever... Open up, please! Open up...please. Vacate the city. Vacate the city. It is ordered that the city be immediately vacated. And then... ...The same thing occured as in London. Subtitles Edit and Re-Synch Jonas Wilde 2019
