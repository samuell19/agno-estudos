Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes - Would you like to borrow it? - Hm? Oh, no, thank you. I've read it. - Are you sure you didn't miss a page? - No, I... I see. I'm sorry. But actually I read it when it first came out. - Did you enjoy it? - Yes, yes, I did. I preferred his other book, "Red Sky All Day'. - That was brilliant. - Yes, I remember. But this is nothing like as good. I think he's going off. Thank you. You do? Can I get you anything, madam? Yes... I'd like to have a small brandy. Make it two, will you? - What can I say? - Please don't say anything. Shall we change the subject? - Are you writing a new novel? - Well, I thought I was. My publisher wants me to do a biography. - I didn't know you wrote biographies. - I don't. - Can't you just refuse to do it? - You don't refuse publishers. That's why I had to leave my lovely villa in the south of France. To reason with him. I've no intention of doing it but it'll take days to persuade him. Your publisher sounds a monster. Oh, Morris is all right. I expect he thinks the biography is a wonderful idea. What is it about? As far as I can make out from his cable it's the life of some young test pilot... - ...who died a few months ago. - A test pilot? Yes, a fellow called Teckman. Martin Teckman. A very brave chap and all that, I'm sure. But imagine writing a book about someone so young. Nobody remembers him apart from his headmaster... ...and a crowd of dreary relatives. Is anything the matter? Oh, no... It's only that I've heard someone was already writing the Teckman biography. If that's true, Morris will have something to answer for. Where did you hear that? I was told. You see, Martin Teckman was my brother. I'm Helen Teckman. Oh... really. - I don't know what to say, Miss Teckman. - Let's change the subject again. Thanks very much. Well, what makes you so sure it was burglars, sir? - It's obvious, isn't it? - Well, no. The doors and windows are unmarked. Your visitor must have had a key. - And you say nothing's missing. - Apparently not. Why don't you look for some clues or something? - Any luck, sergeant? - No prints, sir. Just a few oddments. Hair, button, a bit of gray wool. I've got a pair of gray gloves about that color. - Is this your button? - No. I've never seen it before. It's from an RAF blazer, isn't it? What about this hair? Do you know any long hair blond? Dozens of them. - Get a report on these. - Right, sir. - Oh, that will be Mr. Miller, my publisher. - I'll let him in, sir. All right. What time are you expecting your man back, Mr. Chance? Officially he's due back tomorrow morning. But you can never tell with Leonard. - How long has he been with you, sir? - Oh, about... two years. Oh, he's absolutely trustworthy, ... apart from the fact that he takes time off when he feels like it. - He has a key of the flat. - Yes, of course. - Hello, Morris. - Good heavens, what's going on here? Welcome to the bear garden. This is fantastic, old boy. What's happened? It appears I had a rather a refined burglar. He brought his own keys. Didn't take anything. - Made an awful mess, though. - That shows he was quick-tempered. There's another clue for you, Inspector. You're very helpful, sir. Good afternoon. Well, I'll be getting along now. I might call again later. Oh do, yes. If I'm not in just pick the lock. Oh, by the way. Do they usually send an inspector on a burglary job? No, not usually, sir. But the boys at the station were having their tea break. Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon, gentlemen. He ought to be in music halls, that fellow. Well, it's his bad luck, Phillip. - Will a drink help? - A bit early for me. A bit early for me too, but I'm having one just the same. I'm not taking this jolly well. When you've finished sympathizing, Morris, I've got a bone to pick with you. - Oh? - Why do you fetch me... ...all the way from the South of France to write about... Do you mind? To write a biography about Martin Teckman when someone else is already doing it? Oh, you haven't heard. Barbara Jeffries was doing it until a couple of days ago... ..but unfortunately she had an accident. - Not serious, I hope. - Rather serious. A car knocked her down. She's been in hospital for weeks. So you see, I wasn't such a fool for cabling you. You're a deep fellow, Morris. As soon as we heard about Barbara we had a board meeting... ...and voted unanimously for you to take over the book. It was in the papers, you know. That was careless of you. Why? Because I'm not going to do it. Now don't be difficult, Phillip. I'm going to be extremely difficult, Morris. I'm a novelist, remember? All those pots and pots of money you make out of me? There are bigger pots of money in the Teckman biography. But I don't like biographies. And what's more, I don't know anything about Martin Teckman. - You know he was a test pilot. - What do I know about test pilots? That's just the point. We don't want a book about test pilots. We want a book about Martin Teckman. Anyone can write the usual reminiscenses but that's not enough. There's drama in this story, Phillip, believe me. I'm not listening, Morris. Never mind. Just let it soak in with the drink. Teckman was under 30 when he died. All his life he'd been a dreamer. Remote. His friends never fathomed him. He lived for aeroplanes. Not just flying them... ...but the theory of it as well. All the stresses and strains on the metal, the building of high-speed machines, he had a brilliant brain. His ambition was to take up an experimental plane... ...and track it about the sky. He got it. The F109. A completely hush-hush job. He took it up and the thing disintegrated in the air. He was killed, of course. At the moment he achieved his life's ambition. It's a job for a novelist, Phillip. Well then, old boy, you've convinced me. And I hope you find your novelist very, very soon. Give it a thought. The trouble is, you know, when I think about aeroplanes... ...I think about the South of France. And when I do that... Dreams. Do me one favor, will you? Take a look at that. It's notes about Teckman. If you feel any interest at all go have a talk with old man Garvin. Who's Garvin? He worked with Teckman on the F109. Knew him better than anyone. He's crazy but amiable. You'll find his address there. Somewhere in Camden Town. No, Morris, no... Oh... Well, I'll think about it. - No promises, mind. - Of course not. So you're going to write a book about Martin Teckman, eh? Possibly. Perhaps probably. - You're not committing yourself, are you? - No, not yet. A woman called Barbara Jeffries is writing that book. She had an accident. - Accidental accident? - She was knocked down by a car. Oh... Sorry to hear that. What do you want to know? How much did you see of Martin Teckman? A lot. You see... From 1942 to '44 I was technical assistant... ... to the director of experimental aircraft in Tewkesbury, and Martin was there.. Very junior then, of course. - And that was when you first met him. - Yes. He was hopping from one department to another restless as a sparrow. Trying to learn the job twice as fast as anyone could. We had long talks. - That went on till 1944. - Yes. Then one day he vanished. - If only he'd joined the RAF. - Yes. Do you remember what squadron? It wasn't the 7th, by any chance, was it? I don't remember. Then, after the war he joined the Walter's Armitage... ...combined as a test pilot. By that time I'd become a chief designer. So we saw quite a lot of each other from then on. We worked on the F109 together. Well, Martin made that. Are you still with Walter's Armitage? No. I retired a few months ago. We didn't quite see eye to eye. Perhaps I should war you that uh... I'm not generally considered a reliable source of information these days. Up at Walter's they'll tell you I'm a fool, a charlatan... ...and a dipsomaniac. And are you? Fool perhaps, charlatan no. Dipsomaniac, yes. Ah, a man after my own heart. Oh, I'm sorry. Help yourself. Get yourself a glass. Oh, you'll find a clean glass in the shelf over there. Thanks. How thoughtless we old men get. Mr. Garvin. How important was the F109? - How important? - Yes. - Are you a scientist? - No. Then I won't even try to answer your questions. Then let me put it this way. How important was Martin Teckman's work on the F109? Too important to let him take the plane up. I warned them at Walter's the night before the test but the fools wouldn't listen. You mean the plane wasn't ready. - No, no... - Wasn't Teckman fit? - Perfectly fit? - Well? Mr. Chance, you're an imaginative, intelligent man. - You've read about the accident. - Yes. Well, what do you think happened? We know what happened. The plane disintegrated and Teckman was killed. Didn't they find some parts of the fuselage? Oh, they did. They found it. Brought it back to Walter's. No doubt about it. It was part of the F109 all right. Everybody said so. Everybody was convinced. At least almost everybody. - You don't think it was. - No! - You don't think it did disintegrate. - I do not! - But the fuselage? - I think what they found... ...had been very carefully planted. Then what did happen to the F109? It landed somewhere. Hello? Morris? Phillip here. I'm glad I caught you in. I thought you might have left. Have you had any dinner yet? Uh... good. Well, I've just seen Garvin. Yes, I thought you would be. And by the way, Morris, if I do that biography, I shall expect a jolly good advance. We'll do more than talk about it. Well, I've got an appointment at 8:30, could we make it at 9:00? At The Grill. No, no, I'm having a drink with a fellow called Rice. Mr. Chance? Yes? - I'm John Rice. - How do you do? Very pleased to know you. Sit down, please. - Thank you. - What will you have? Whisky for me, please. One whisky and another tomato juice, please. Yes, sir. Forgive my saying so, but you are younger than I anticipated. You and I are going to get on well together, Mr. Rice. I certainly hope so. You know, I'm an admirer of yours. I just finished your book 'Red Sky All Day'. Wonderful! Excellent! But I told you that on the phone, didn't I? I don't mind hearing it twice. You know that sequence in Berlin... you know what I mean... I really felt I'd been there. Did you? It had the same effect on me. You mean you wrote that without going to Berlin? But the description was so convincing. Naturally, I only read the best travel magazines. Mr. Chance, you surprise me. How about you surprising me and telling me what it is you want? - Of course. - Will you have one? Thanks, I don't smoke. It's a fact I was going to make you an offer. - But after what I heard... - What sort of offer? First let me tell you who I am. I am the European director of an American magazine called the New World. We are a 5-million-dollar outfit. But that's not here nor there. Now... My head office wants me to arrange a series of articles... ...on life in present-day Berlin. I mean, popular articles. You know, like uh... what Mr. Schmidt pays for housekeeping, etc., but... ...written by an expert. Having read your book, I immediately thought of you. East or West Berlin? Western Zone, of course. We don't want anything political, no, sir! I see. Thank you. - Keep the change. - Thank you, sir. Well, I'll think about it, Mr. Rice. We want six articles. One a month. For that we pay all the expenses. $300,00 weekly to play around with... ...and $2,100.00 an article. How much is that in sterling? Oh, say... ?750 each article. I've thought about it. I'll do it. But there is just one snag. I've got a book on hand. And I may have to delay articles for a few months. I'm afraid that's not possible. You see, we've got space reserved on our next issue. It's a question of leaving for Berlin in two days' time. Well... You talk good business, Mr. Rice. I'm tempted to postpone the book. Only it had some interesting contacts and uh... To be quite frank, there is a young lady involved. I don't like to spoil your plans. Suppose you think it over and answer me tomorrow? - Yes. - Good. In case you accept, I'll bring along your ticket and in advance, say... ?1,000, would that do? Yes, that would do. Good of you to condescend to come. Sorry I'm late, old man. I was kept at the office. - Liar. - It's true! No publisher ever had that much work. What's all this? I've been trying to work out what 6 times 750... ...plus 100 a week for 6 months comes to. And I seem to three different answers. And they're all a lovely lot of money. But I can't pay you that. Too true you can't. But an American magazine can. You shouldn't keep me waiting, Morris. It's giving me time to think. I suppose that means you're not going to do the book for me. I'm only postponing it for 6 months while I'm in Berlin. Cheer up, Morris. I'm going to buy you a smashing dinner on the money they're going to give me. It'll probably choke me. Hello? Oh, I'm sorry, he's not in. This is Mrs. Miller. Oh, hello, Phillip! But I thought Morris was dining with you. Well, he's not back yet. Oh, wait a minute. I think I hear him coming in now. - Morris! - Yes? Phone. - Who is it? - It's Phillip. Morris here. A bit late, isn't it? Wants me to come round to his place. Well, blast it, Inspector, I've told you Mr. Miller will confirm all I've said. And he'll identify poor old Garvin, isn't that enough? - Good night, doctor. - Good night. - I'm sure you're being very patient, sir. - I am being patient! But you might remember this is my flat. I try to live here. Which is hard enough with a robbery yesterday and dead bodies today. And on top of that you come here with your crowd of zombies... ...and treat me like a criminal. I have a right to know what's going on! Of course. Very well, then. Suppose you tell me how he was killed? With a knife. When? We're not sure. But he was brought here dead. That's all for these boys, sir. Can they go now? - Yes. Good night. - Good night, sir. Now perhaps you'll tell me why you went to see Garvin this afternoon. I was going to write a book about a man called Martin Teckman. - A test pilot? - Yes. My publisher told me that Garvin was a friend of Teckman's... ...and could be helpful so I went along to have a chat with him. Did you tell anyone you were going to see Garvin? No. Inspector... In a case of this kind... ...am I allowed to go out of the country? Why should you? Well, I'm supposed to be flying to Berlin tomorrow morning and... - Berlin? - Yes. In connection with the book you're writing? Uh, no. I changed my mind about the book. This is another job. I see. So you needn't have visited Garvin. Well, that was before I changed my mind. Has your telephone got an extension? Yes, there's one in the bedroom. - May I use it, please? - Certainly. You might ask them about my leaving tomorrow. Oh, I think that will be all right, sir. We can always find you if we want you. Hello, Morris. It's good of you to come. Really, it is too bad of you, Phillip, I was just going to bed. What is it now? Not another burglary. No, Morris. This time it's serious. This time it's murder. - Murder? - Yes. Garvin. Andrew Garvin? Yes, poor old chap. By the way, Morris, you're my alibi. But this is frightful. Is there anything you haven't told me about this Teckman business? What do you mean? Oh, just that there are about 101 questions I'd like answered. For instance, if I ever do the book, shall I be run over like the first author... ...or knifed like the first man I interviewed? I assure you, old chap, I've told you everything I know. Good evening, Mr. Miller. I understand you're going to help us to identify this body as Andrew Garvin. I? Oh, no, Inspector, I only met him once and that was years ago. - But you introduced me to him. - No, I didn't. I just gave you his name. When did you meet the deceased, sir? During the war. Garvin gave a public lecture at the engineering school at Oxford... ... and a friend of mine who knew him well took me along. And what was your friend's name? Oh, I'm afraid he can't help you. He died recently. Perhaps you'll just tell me his name. Martin Teckman. You never told me you actually knew Martin Teckman. Didn't I? We were in the RAF together. We were never close friends, of course... What squadron were you in? - I beg your pardon? - I said, what squadron were you in? Why, the 7th. - Acid. - Oh, bad luck. Now, that's your plane ticket. London Airport, 11 o'clock tomorrow morning. - I hope that's not too soon. - No, no, the sooner the better. Excellent! You know, I had my doubts yesterday whether you would agree. Yes, so did I. But a whole lot of reasons arrived in a body. Perhaps you read about Garvin in the newspapers. Garvin? No. I haven't seen a paper today. - Should I know about him? - No, never mind. Uh... is there anything else you'd like to give me? How silly of me! Of course, your check. Here. Mind you don't drop it. It's not the sort that bounces. I've attached the bank's letterhead in case you want to ring it. Oh, good. Now, about my Berlin expenses. - Do you think I should... - That's been fixed by Kessler. He'll meet you there. Rudolph Kesner, our Berlin representative. I'll give a letter of introduction to you. - Oh, good. - There. You'll like Kesner, he's a great guy. - I'm sure I will. - Thanks. Excuse me, just one other thing uh... - About the hotel accommodation... - Don't worry, my boy, don't worry. Kesner will look after you. You'll reach Berlin nicely in time for tea. I never touch the stuff. Here's to you. Bon voyage. Miss Teckman, what a pleasant surprise! - Do come in. - Thank you. I almost rang you once or twice. - But you didn't. - Uh, no, I've been rather busy. - Perhaps you've read the papers? - Yes... Is this where you found him? Yes, poor fellow. - Will you have a glass of sherry or anything. - Oh, no, thank you, no. I had a letter from Garvin today. That's really why I came here. - A letter from Garvin? - Yes, he must have posted it just... - Do you suggest any reason why he... - No, no, it's quite short. He says... 'Most impressed by Chance, good brain, he'll do the book well. Hope you'll help him all you can.' Terrible thought, isn't it? He must have written this soon after I left him. There's no hint of fear in it. And yet, at 11 o'clock he was lying there. Mr. Chance, what did he mean about the book? Hm? Oh, of course. You thought I wasn't going to do it, didn't you? - Yes. - Well, I wasn't. Then I was, now I've postponed it for six months. - How complicated. - Yes. Everything about your brother seems to get complicated. Oh, please, do have one of these. Oh, thank you. Garvin told me some very strange things. - You mean his theory about the F109? - Yes. - Did he tell you? - Hm... he told nearly everyone. That was really why he lost his job at Walter's. He couldn't stop talking about it. You didn't like Garvin, did you? Not really. He drank too much. Yes, shocking, isn't it? But you know, Miss Teckman, that's not what he died of. I know, it's horrible. And happening here. Do you mind talking about your brother? To some people I do, but not to you. I'd like to hear about Martin. Because, you see, when I write a novel, I see my characters as real people. But... when I started this biography... I found I couldn't get near my subjects. I haven't seen Martin as a real person at all. I assure you he was. What kind of person? Why is there all this mystery about him? I don't think there's any mystery about him. He was rather shy and modest. Perhaps a bit reserved. There are thousands of people like that but one can get to know them. But look what happens when somebody gets to know your brother. Barbara Jeffries is run over. Garvin is killed. And now, who knows, perhaps it's my turn. Don't say that. Miss Teckman... Your brother may have been the gentlest of persons himself. - But he was high explosive to others. - I can't believe that. You knew him better than anyone else. Would you have described Martin as a fanatic? Liable to get a bee in his bonnet about something? A fanatic, good heavens, no. Well, of course he got crazes about things like everyone else. One year it was Van Gogh, I remember. Then he went mad on a dance tune. Room 504, you know it, I expect. - Yes. 'In room 504...' - Yes, that's it. Well, he played the wretched record till it wore right out... ...then started whistling it. It drove us all mad. I got like that with 'Red Sails in the Sunset'. Is your family still alive? No, both my parents died at the beginning of the war. Do you know? It's easy talking to you about Martin. Then let's go out to dinner and carry on talking. Strictly on a business basis, of course. But I thought you weren't starting the book for six months. Well, I'll need food for thought in Berlin. - Berlin? - Yes, I'm flying there tomorrow... ...to do some articles. Where is that pencil? - Here. - Wh... oh! I'll give you my address there and then we can swap postcards I'm staying with a man called Rudolph Kesner. I'm glad... after what happened to Garvin. Oh, I'm not going because of that. I have a far better reason. Money. Come on. Miss Teckman won't be a minute. - I'll just move these designs. - Thank you. Make yourselves at home. - Good morning. - Miss Teckman? - Yes, how do you do? - I'm Detective Inspector Hilton. This is a colleague of mine, Major Harris. How do you do? I daresay you've guessed why we're here? It's about Andrew Garvin. I understand he was a friend of your brother's. - Yes, he was. Do sit down. - Thank you. Was he a very close friend? Oh, yes, they saw a good deal of each other. Particularly during the war. They worked together on the F109. Miss Teckman, were you on very friendly terms with your brother? Oh, yes, very. - You saw a good deal of him? - Quite a lot. This photograph of your brother was taken while he was at Walter's Armitage. And there's another man with him, apparently a friend of your brother's. Do you think you can identify him? No, I've never seen him before. But that's not surprising. My brother had a lot of friends I knew nothing about. You're sure you've never seen this man before. Quite sure. I suppose the name Kesner doesn't mean anything to you? Rudolph Kesner? Rudolph Kesner? Excuse me just a minute. Yes, I thought so. Mr. Chance's address in Berlin is care of Rudolph Kesner. He has a letter of introduction to him. Is there anything wrong? What time does Chance's plane leave? Eleven o'clock. I suggest you wait in the building. - Will the plane wait? - Well, it might not. Mr. Chance will be angry with me if he misses his train. Oh, we'll protect you, miss. They'd better hold the plane or I'll sue the whole blasted company! Good morning, sir. Oh, so it's you again, Inspector. Now what...? Helen, what are you doing here? - I have no idea. - My name is Harris. Major Harris. Well you can go to blazes... Miss Teckman tells us that you're going to Berlin... ...to write a series of magazine articles. - If you don't mind. - What is the name of the magazine? Oh really, you haven't dragged me off the plane and rushed down here... ...just to ask me the name of a magazine. No. But since you are here, would you mind telling us? Well, it's called The New World. Now, may I go? The New World. And the name of the editor? I don't know. I've never met the editor. Indeed? I dealt with the European representative. A man called John Rice. Have you ever seen a copy of this New World? No, but I've seen a check for ?1.000 Oh, Mr. Rice gave you a check for ?1.000. Yes, and you will too, if I miss this plane. Was the check all right? Would I be going to Berlin if it wasn't? Could you describe this Mr. Rice? Yes, he's mid-European, small, going grey and wears spectacles. How do you know he was a mid-European? Well, he talks like one. Would this be your Mr. Rice, by any chance? Oh, blimey! No, he's much... Say, Helen, isn't that other man your brother? - Yes. - Oh, that's Martin Teckman, all right. But it's the other gentleman we're interested in. It's not Rice. Is that all? We know who this man is. His name is Rudolph Kesner. Rudolph Kesner. - I have a letter of introduction to him. - So I believe. Excuse me. Would you care to read your letter of introduction, Mr. Chance? What's so unusual about that? Did you notice the reference number? Now do you want to catch your plane, Mr. Chance? As if a writer's life wasn't hard enough in the first place, what with taxes, and publishers. What have I done to deserve it anyway? Nothing. All I did was to go and see Garvin. Promptly all these creatures crawl out of the woodwork. Yes. Who is the fellow Harris anyway? And who's Kesner? And where does Rice fit in? You'll feel better when you've had a cup of tea. Move up. Do you realize that I can't even prove that Rice exists? But you cleared his check with the bank, didn't you? I cleared his check with the telephone number he gave me. Rice seems to have thought of everything. Yes. I wonder what he's cooking up now. All my life I've had a golden rule. Take no chances, Chance. - That's not an ashtray. - Oh. It's perfectly useless. How can I take no chances when I haven't the faintest idea what's going on? Phillip, are you cross with me for telling the police about Kesner? You probably saved my life. I don't object to that. But what are you going to do now? Do? What can I do? Go back to my flat and wait for a two-headed Chinese... ...to ask me to write a book on algebra. - Hello? - Frobisher 4330? Could I speak to Miss Teckman, please? Speaking. - Is that you, Helen? - Who is that? - Who's that speaking? - Don't you know my voice, Helen? I can't say my name. Martin! What is it? Here, give me that telephone. Hello? Hello? Who is it? Blast! Was it him? - It was, I'm sure it was. - How could you be sure? He whistled that tune, the same way exactly. Oh, Phillip, what does it mean? - If he's alive, why doesn't he say...? - Did he say his name? No. He rang off as soon as he heard my voice. He must have been frightened. You shouldn't have done that. Oh, Phillip, do you suppose that Garvin was right? That the F109 didn't crash and that Martin landed it somewhere? It wouldn't stop him from saying his name, would it? Perhaps he was frightened, hiding. Perhaps he was ill. He may have lost his memory. I don't like the sound of it, Helen. If that really was Martin and he really is in danger, - ...there's a simple remedy. - What's that? He can go to the police and explain to them... ...what he's been doing for the last six months. - Oh, leave me alone. - You'd better tell the police. But he's my brother! He won't do himself any good with all this hocus pocus on the telephone. Oh, please go, Phillip! All right, I'll go. I know it's been a shock, Helen. But the police ought to know. I must think. Good evening. What the... Oh, so it's you. Why didn't you wait inside? - Have you lost your key? - Keep away from that phone, please. You know, I have an uneasy suspicion, Mr. Rice, that you're going to start talking to me out of the corner of your mouth. Put that phone down! There you are. What did I tell you? Where is that letter I gave you? I really can't take you seriously. - A revolver as well then. - I want that letter. - Why? There's nothing in it. - Don't try me too far, Mr. Chance. I'd rather not try you at all. You don't scare easily, Mr. Chance. - I'll explain something. - No, you listen to me. There's no use pretending you've got the upper hand... ...just because you're carrying a revolver. It might just as well be just a stick of rhubarb, because I have the letter. - If you kill me, you'll never find it. - Maybe. The police are on to Kesner, you know? They've shown me a photo of him. A photo of Kesner? It's an interesting face, isn't it? I'm sure he would have treated me like a... shall we say, brother? Was that at the airport? Amusing, isn't it? And I've got some other news for you, too. Perhaps you could help me put it into perspective. Go on. Well, you see, the police are apparently following up lines on Kesner. But here's an odd thing. None of those lines seems to have led to you. The police have somehow missed you out. They're not even sure you exist. So what? Well, I keep asking myself, if the police know about Kesner, why don't they know about Rice? And the answer keeps coming back. Rice doesn't know Kesner very well. Rice isn't quite in with the top people. Rice is an outsider. What do you say to that? You seem to know too much, Mr. Chance. Actually, I make it up as I go along. But it seems to have hit the mark. Will you excuse me? Why, certainly. - Did you get the letter? - No. - Hadn't he got it. - I don't know. I wouldn't be in your shoes. Leonard! Oh, good evening, sir. So you got back all right? Come here, you rascal! How late are you? Three days, sir. Do you realize that during that time this place has been burgled, murdered in and only a few moments ago I was struck on the head with a gun? - Tsk, tsk, That's not as it should be. - Exactly! Of course that wouldn't have happened if I'd been here. No, of course not, But you were looking after your dear, poor old aunt, is that the story? No, don't say that, sir. She's very poorly, my aunt. - Ohh! - Sorry, sir. And you're expecting a crisis next Saturday, no doubt. That's right, sir. Or failing that, a replay on the following Wednesday. Go get me some ice for my head. And Leonard... - Take a week's notice. - Yes, sir. I'll answer the door first. Oh, if you don't like the look of them, bash their face in. Is Mr. Chance in? My name is Harris. Don't bash, Leonard! - There you are. - Good evening, Major. - You're a bit late. - What for? A demonstration of armed assault exhibited by Mr. John Rice... - ...on a harmless novelist. - Rice has been here? I'm telling you. He hit me on the head. I hope it hasn't swollen as a result. - Have a drink, Major. - No, I can only stay a minute. - What did Rice come here for? - He wanted his letter back. Did you tell him you hadn't got it? I skated around the point like a Cabinet Minister. Did your man see Rice? No. Se we still have only your word that Rice exists. My word and my bump! Mr. Chance, you're going to be in a very tricky position... ...if you can't prove that Rice exists. I don't see why you should leave all the work to me. Why don't you ask Kesner? That's the obvious thing to do. That's why we shan't do it. - Well, what do you want me to do? - That's what I've come here for. I want you to send a telegram to Berlin, to Kesner. Saying what? Saying that you want to contact Rice immediately and don't know his address. Do you think he'll fall for that? For your sake, Mr. Chance, I hope so. Goodbye. Hello? Yes, hello? Mr. Chance? - What have you got there? - It's the ice, sir. Uh... that's me, yes. My name is Ruth Wade No, I didn't expect you to have heard of me. I understand that you're writing a biography of Martin Teckman. The whole world seems to know about that. - Ohh... - You've now got a bump there, sir. I can't seem to get out of it. Would you like to do it? Oh, no. But I think I may be able to help you. I was a friend of Martin Teckman's. A close friend. Oh. No one ever mentioned your name to me. Well, there's a good reason for that and I'd like to tell you about it. Could I come over to your flat this evening? I wouldn't do that. It's become rather a social center lately. Did somebody really give you a clout, sir? I told you! Uh... can I come around to you? Yes... yes, the address is 47 Harrison Court. 47 Harrison Court. All right, Miss Wade, 7 o'clock. Helen! Phillip... Oh, Phillip! I'm so frightened. What on earth have you got there? Who were you trying to shoot? - I don't know. - I think you'd better come and sit down. But Phillip, why did you come here? A girl telephoned me this afternoon... ...and said she was a friend of Martin's and could help me. - What about you? - I girl telephoned me too. She said if I came here this evening I'd meet a very close friend. - I thought she meant Martin. - What name did she give you? - She didn't say. - She told me she was Ruth Wade. - Ruth Wade? - Yes. You've heard of her? Yes. She's secretary to Sir Charles Shaughnessy, the head of Walter's Armitage. But she doesn't know about Martin. - Phillip, what shall I do? - You poor thing, you're trembling. Look, I'll cope with Miss Wade if she comes. You go back to my flat and wait for me there. Leonard will let you in. And do put this cannon away. It doesn't suit you at all. It's Martin's. It's awfully heavy. Phillip, I think I'll go back to my own flat. - Why? - I ought never to have left it. I'm sure all this was to get me away because something is happening. I must go back. Will you come there after this? I can't, I'm afraid. I'm expecting a visit from our friend Rice tonight or tomorrow. - Rice? - Yes. The police persist in believing I invented him. So I'm arranging an appointment. Phillip... Are you being quite honest with me? Honest, humble and affectionate. Now come on, don't worry. - Oh, Mr. Chance? - Yes. I'm Ruth Wade. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. You were quite right to come in. I had to borrow some milk from a neighbor upstairs and she started gossiping. Oh, you've minded the coffee, thank you. Do sit down and have some. I'm afraid I can't wait for the coffee. I'm in a hurry. Will you tell me what you have to say? You sounded friendly on the phone. No doubt. All right... if that's how you feel. Are you aware that Martin Teckman is alive and in London? Has he been in touch with you? - No, he hasn't. - Then how do you know he's in London? - Did Helen tell you? - Helen Teckman? - Oh, no. - What do you mean, oh, no? I mean that Helen Teckman and I are not that well acquainted. And yet you invited her here this evening. I invited Helen Teckman her? Certainly not. - She thinks you did. - Then one of us is mistaken. Miss Wade, what exactly is your interest in Martin Teckman? He happens to be my husband. We were married on June 3rd, 1952. A few weeks before Martin flew the F109. - Very few people know. - Does Helen know? Not unless Martin told her. This afternoon Teckman phoned Helen. Hm? Why did he phone Helen and not you? He didn't get in touch with me for my sake. Why should he ring Helen? I hoped and hoped. What did you hope? Mr. Chance, you seem to know far more than I imagined. Please. Please, if you can, will you tell me one thing? Yes. Why has Martin come to England? Does anyone know, except Martin? Mr. Rigby here? Mr. Rigby! Leonard, get me the telephone! Pour me another cup of coffee. Hello? Chance? Rice. Oh, Rice. I hope you're in good shape. I don't want anything. It's what you want. Yes, your letter. I thought the police had it. So you've got it. All right. What made you change your mind? Well, I couldn't sleep at night thinking of all the money you owe me. Several thousand quid. Yes, well I shall be generous, considering I never wrote the articles. You can have the letter for uh... For a thousand pounds. Yes... Yes, but cash. No checks, Yes, it is blackmail, isn't it? When can you come and get it? I can't! That's my affair. You'll have to bring it down here. A place called Datchett. It's a boat. A boat, eh? That's sporting. How do I get there? Yes. I know it, yes. All right, I'll be with you at 10 o'clock. - Goodbye - Goodbye, Rice. No. No! No! Hello, Rice! I'm here! Well, there's my Mr. Rice for you. - Now do you believe in him? - We'd have preferred him alive, sir. I daresay. It must be very irritating for you, Inspector, to meet someone you can't question. It makes it a much harder job for us checking your story. Oh now, hold on a minute. Play fair. I've given you Rice, the rest is up to you. The rest? Well yes, you know, uh... Who did it, and clues, and things like that. We know who did it, don't we? Do you? Who? I daresay he did it himself. It was suicide. Of course, yes... Have you any reason to doubt that, Mr. Chance? Certainly not... You're the experts, after all. May I go now? Yes, yes, of course. Thank you. I thought it might be yours. You have got one like it, haven't you? Yes, I've got one quite like it. There. Only mine are all here. Where did you find it? Uh...on a boat near Datchett. On a boat near Datchett? What an extraordinary place to be. - It was Rice's. - So you found Rice! Yes, I found him. Dead. Oh, Phillip! And this was there? It was lying just by the body. I wonder whose it can be. Oh, Phillip, you don't think that I went to the boat. - Of course not, I didn't mean that. - You thought it was mine and I... Oh, Phillip! How could you? Would you rather I'd left it there? Well, all right, so it isn't yours. But it might have been, mightn't it? I'm not saying you killed Rice. It so happens he committed suicide. I was simply trying to keep you out of it, that's all. Oh, Phillip, I'm sorry, it's awful of me to laugh but... But it was rather a shock. Good evening, Leonard. Sorry to get you up. - Oh, g-g-good evening, sir. - Run me a bath will you? - Any messages? - No, sir. Uh, yes, sir. And you'll have to hurry. Mr. Miller rang. He wants you to dine with him at 7:15. A quarter... it's past that now. Yes, sir. And I think a change of color is necessary. - What's the matter with this one? - War paint, sir. Oh... - Where am I supposed to meet Mr. Miller? - Uh, the something Mayonnaise, sir. - The what? - It's a restaurant, sir. The something Mayonnaise. - Don't be ridiculous, Leonard. - No, sir. Would it be the Maison Anglaise? That's right, sir. - Any other messages? - No, sir. - A dull afternoon. - We can't all be lucky. Oh, yes! There was a young man who came to the door. What did he want? I don't know, sir. He was some sort of salesman, I think. I went and answered the door, then the phone rang... ...and by the time I got back he'd gone. Bad luck. Oh, by the way, Leonard, I'm having the lock on the door changed. - Oh, very wise, sir. - So, I shall want your key. I'll leave it on your desk, sir. Right. That's all, Leonard. Good night. Good evening, sir. Have you booked a table? No, I'm meeting someone. Mr. Chance? Yes, it's me. Mr. Miller's been delayed. That is, I delayed him. Won't you sit down? - You're Teckman! - Keep your voice down. No, not yet, not yet. - I want to talk to you. - You ought to talk to the police. For heaven's sake, sit down! Look, I've been hunted through Europe for the past six months. I'm a little edgy. I've lost my sense of humor and I can't control my temper. So for pity's sake sit still and listen! Where's Miller? I called at your flat, I heard your man on the phone... ...so I rang Miller and told him you couldn't come till late. Fair enough. - Are you still being hunted? - Yes. - So you took a big risk coming here. - Yes. - Just to see me? - You can help me. I trust you. - I wish I could say the same for you. - Oh, for heaven's sake, save your jokes. I may be dead tomorrow. You can joke then. I've got a letter here. It must be delivered by hand. Uh-uh, wait a minute. I've been caught like that before. Then you won't help me. You'll have to persuade me by answering a few down-to-earth questions. Quickly then. - Where's the F109? - Smashed to pieces. So Garvin was wrong. What did Garvin say? He thought it landed somewhere and the wreckage was just planted. - Is that what happened? - No, fortunately. What did happen? - I changed my mind. - So that was the original plan. - Yes. - But you changed your mind. I think I found my mind. My own mind. You see, when you're flying you see things pretty clearly. What did you see? I saw that my mind was a prisoner. Not free to decide. And then what? I bailed out and let the plane crash. I thought I could hide. For 5 months I got away with it. Then one day somebody recognized me quite by accident. Twenty-four hours later a man was shot. He'd been mistaken for me. - Are you really all that dangerous? - Of course I am. Look, I know these characters, who they are, what they are and how they work. I have only to go to the police... Yes, but you don't go to the police, do you, Teckman? That's what's so damn phony about you. You give me this long story about crashing the plane, and hiding... ...and being hunted so that I shall think you've become a patriotic Englishman. But the one thing you don't do is tell the police! Instead, you go lurking about London ringing people up. Isn't it about time you thought of your wife, and your sister... ...and Garvin, who died because of you? You fool, do you think it's as easy as that? Listen, I'll say it again. I trust you. Won't you trust me just till tomorrow? I know what I'm doing. Who is the letter for? It's for Helen. You must give it to her personally. I suppose her house is being watched, her phone is being tapped and her letters are being opened. I know they are. All right. Now, suppose you... Excuse me, Mr. Chance, telephone for you, sir. That'll be Miller. Wait a minute... How did he know my name? Oh, no, Teckman, you don't give it to me as easily as that. We've got a lot to talk about yet. For instance, you haven't told me about Rice. I've never heard of Rice. - Ah, good evening, monsieur. - There's Miller now. He'll be glad to see you again. - Is my table ready? - Hello, Morris. You've been ages. Well, I like that. You said you couldn't be here till late. Never mind about that now. I've got a big surprise for you. Blast the man! Wait for me here, Morris! Like to order something, monsieur? Later. - Morris... - Phillip, what on earth are you up to? I've been playing hide and seek with Martin Teckman. Teckman? Phillip, are you pulling my leg? Don't flap, Morris! Where's that letter? Oh. Now listen to me. Teckman's in London. We've got to tell the police. Now, I've promised to take this letter to Helen. So I want you to ring up Inspector Hilton at Scotland Yard... ...tell him to go to my flat and wait there. Have you got that? - Yes, but... - All right. Do hurry up, Morris. I'll see you at the flat. Helen? Oh, good, I thought you might be out. Look, I've got to come around and see you at once. Well, I don't know how much I can tell you on this telephone but... ...I've got a letter for you. But never mind, I'll be with you in one second. Hold tight, dear. Goodbye. Monsieur, don't you want to order anything? All right, just a second! Oh, hello, darling! I'm sorry I had to be so cryptic on the telephone. - Did you get what I meant? - Yes. - You meant Martin. - Yes. - You're sure it was him? - I'm quite sure. His handwriting will prove it anyway. - He told me a few things too. - What did he say? About the F109, for one thing. He bailed out and let it crash. Oh, God! Old Garvin wasn't so wrong after all. But it seems Martin changed his mind in mid-air. Oh, Martin. He's been chased all over Europe. He looks it, poor fellow, too. Aren't you going to open your letter? Helen. To be quite frank, haven't you ever faced the possibility that Martin might have... I was terribly afraid it might be true. Oh, Phillip! - I'll get you a drink. - No, it's all right. I'll be fine in a minute. I'll just go and get a hanky. - Would you like a brandy, darling? - Yes. Oh, thank you. - I'm sorry to make such a fuss. - I think you're being very brave. Here, you read it. I don't want to. All right, if you say so. He says... Dearest Helen, don't think too badly of me but I can't keep this up much longer. My wife gave me courage to do a reckless thing but my nerve went. I'd tell the police if I weren't a coward. Goodbye, Helen. God bless you. Martin. Phillip... he said his wife. - He's married to Ruth Wade. - So she's the one behind it all. Never mind about her for the moment. He's the one that matters now. But Phillip, what are we to do? What we've been trying to do. Find him. - I'm afraid he's not in, sir. - What do you mean he's not in? I got an urgent message saying he wanted to see me. Oh, well, would you care to wait? I sent that message, Inspector. Mr. Chance asked me to. Well, perhaps you can tell me where he is and what he wants. At the moment he's delivering a note to Miss Teckman. That's hardly my affair. He told me that the note was from Martin Teckman. Well, that makes a difference. He also said that he met Martin Teckman at the restaurant we were in. Do you believe him? I don't know what to believe, Inspector. Mr. Miller, I gather you were in the RAF with Teckman. In the same squadron, in fact. Yes, I told you that. Well, did you ever have any special buttons made... ...with the RAF emblem on them and the number of your squadron? Buttons? Oh, I know what you mean. Yes, I did. I had some made for a blazer after I was demobbed. Why do you ask? Oh, just idle curiosity, sir. You detectives make an ordinary question sound like a third degree. Good evening Inspector. I'm glad you've come. Hello, Morris. Thanks. Well, did Mr. Miller tell you the news? I understand you're supposed to have seen Martin Teckman. You're not supposed to doubt it, I saw him large as life. What's more, he gave me a letter for his sister. - Which I believe you've delivered. - Yes. Well, didn't it occur to you that such a letter... ...should be taken straight to Scotland Yard? Well, no, Inspector. It didn't. But I know what's in the letter. - Well? - It was a farewell message. He evidently means either to leave the country or... ...to leave the world. I think we'd better find Harris. If I followed you correctly, Mr. Chance, the sequence of events was like this. Teckman gave you the letter and after some discussion you put it on the table. A waiter could have seen it. You were called to the telephone but didn't go, suspecting some trick. Then Miller arrived, you stood up. And while your back was turned, Teckman vanished. You chased Teckman and lost him. You returned to the restaurant and Miller was there with the letter in his hand. Then you took it to Miss Teckman. Have I got it right? In every suspicious detail. Ask Miss Wade to come in, will you, please? Will you come in, Miss Wade? Good evening, Miss Wade. Did you bring your writing? Yes. It's only a short letter, I'm afraid. Yes, that will do very well. Do sit down. Now, Mr. Chance... Would you say this note was written by the same person as the letter you read? No. Certainly not. The handwriting is quite different. Thank you, Mr. Chance. That's all I want to know. Wait a minute, it's not all I want to know. Who did write that? Martin Teckman. How do you know? Who told you? It's a letter he wrote to me before we got married. Of course you have Miss Wade's word for that. Well, let me tell you she has a thumping good reason for lying. - Why should I lie? - To save your own skin, of course. I've already told you what Teckman wrote in that letter. And I suggest that woman is behind this whole business. Really, Mr. Chance. We've known Miss Wade for quite a time. Longer than we've known you. Thanks very much. Inspector, do you mind telling me what the devil this whole business is about? Where would you like us to begin, sir? Well, since we shall be needing Mr. Chance's help... ...you might as well begin at the beginning, Inspector. That'll be about the time Teckman joined a certain political group. That's right. A member of that group persuaded him to fly the F109 to a foreign country. But they didn't persuade him quite enough. He crashed it instead. - Yes, I know that. - Since then, Teckman's been on the run. We don't know why he's running or where he's headed for. He obviously he doesn't want to contact the police. And he obviously daren't rejoin the group... ...because the only way they want him is dead. Oh, Miss Wade, there's no need for you to stay. Sergeant, would you show Miss Wade out? - Good night. - Good night. Well, you two have made everything clear as mud. Where do I come in to this. You come under the heading of dangerous busybody. There's gratitude for you. You share the honor with Barbara Jeffries and Garvin. What about my favorite character, Rice? Oh, Rice was a little man with big ambitions. He didn't like the way the hunt for Teckman was going. So he decided to whisper to the boss The boss was Kesner. We found a code message in that letter he gave you... ...complaining about a member of the group. But the group didn't know about that message. They knew you had a letter to Kesner. That was enough. Only the head of the group was allowed to contact Kesner. Rice knew that quite well, that's why he died. I thought he had something on his conscience. He had. Among other things, Garvin's death. Now, Mr. Chance, knowing what you do, are you prepared to help us? - Yes. - Even if it's dangerous? Oh... I suppose so. Well, it's not. I want you to take Miss Teckman out to lunch tomorrow. Now you come over the road to my flat and let's have a drink. That's very kind of you, sir. Thank you for a lovely lunch. Well, I'll be pushing along now. - I'd ask you in but I have such a lot to do. I quite understand. Perhaps we might have some dinner tonight. Yes, perhaps we could. Well, I'm sorry to be such dull company, Phillip. - Nonsense. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Well, what now? Thank you, Mr. Chance, that was great help. It spoiled the taste of my lunch. - Did you get what you wanted? - We did. OMP from 9C for Charlie. Can I have car to car with 10C for Charlie? 10C for Charlie here. We're in position. Well, let us know if you see her. Roger. - Well, what do we do now? - Oh, nothing yet. We just uh... sit here. That's right. Well, that's fine. She's coming out of the back now. Right. Which way is she heading? She's getting into a taxi. - Heading this way. - We're coming around. Follow up. That's Martin Teckman. So that's why she came up here. - Is Wallace standing by? - Yes, he's there. Tell him to keep them inside. We'll stay here. Contact us as soon as you know where they're heading. Roger. Wallace is following them into the tower. Side entrance. Right. We'll get round there. You do the same, only wait at the corner. Tower Bridge itself, ladies and gentlemen, is comparatively modern, as its foundations were not laid until as recently as 1886. Sorry, I thought we were being followed. What do you want? What is it? Why have you come back? You don't seem very glad to see me. But you shouldn't have come back. You'll be killed. You know the police are trying to find you. I had to come back. Moving onwards. Please keep together. Keep in your party, please. In the white tower, ladies and gentlemen, to which the inner and outer walls were added during the next two centuries, you will find every type of weapon of war... ...from the bow and arrow to the modern rifle... ...from the days of William the Conqueror to the present day. This tower, ladies and gentlemen, which now houses the armory... I can't help you. I tried but they're turning on me now. And the police are after you because of Phillip. - Phillip Chance? Why, he's honest enough. - He's a fool! If Rice hadn't interfered, I could have led him away easily. He didn't want me to. Why have you taken these stupid risks? What did you want here? Is it money? - I want you to be safe. - What do you mean? We're in position now. Okay. Now do listen. There's a boat down there at the docks. It's leaving tonight. I've fixed you a place on it. - Me? - Yes. Do you mean you've come all this way to arrange for us to leave the country? - Not us, you. - What are you talking about? I'm giving myself up to the police. Martin! Will those people rejoin the party on this side of the chains, please. Hadn't we better go in, Major? She may be in danger. No, she's all right. We've got a man in there. Besides, Teckman won't hurt her. What makes you so sure? Oh, yes. Here's the real letter Teckman gave you in the restaurant. We found it in her bedroom. She did go into her bedroom while I was pouring her a drink. She must have prepared the other note... ...as soon as you telephoned to say you were arriving. I suppose you think that ties up your case, Major. Don't you? I'm still convinced that Helen Teckman has been trying to protect her brother. At a considerable risk to herself too. And I don't see that this letter business proves anything to the contrary. I said I've made up my mind. My own mind. You can't make me change it. Can't I, you fool? You never made up your mind in your life. I was your mind. - And I still am. - No, Helen, not any longer. You've always had your own way all our lives. You were stronger than me and quicker, and you still are. But I've changed. I always felt safe with you. You protected me. I never felt frightened. All my courage came from you. It was your courage that flew the plane. But these last six months I found out what I was. A coward. And now I know I'm a coward. I don't need you. You'll regret this. You'll be killed. Is that the worst threat you can think of? It's all I deserve. You'll never do it. You haven't the willpower. You're ill. Your nerve will give way. You're exhausted. You haven't got the strength. Goodbye, Helen. There he is, boys. This is it. It's all right. He's lucky. It's only a shoulder wound. - Is he all right? - Yes, nothing serious. I never thought they'd take a risk like that. Now I'll get them. They aimed too high, I'm afraid. Oh, Martin! Where's Chance? It's all right. He's following Helen. Helen! The police have been trying to make me believe a lot of things about you. They say that you came to France to dissuade me from writing that biography. And that you arranged our meeting on the plane deliberately. They've also told me that you're the head of a subversive group. It isn't true, is it? No. I knew it wasn't. But you have been playing me up a bit, haven't you, Helen? Changing Martin's letter over like that. You knew he was married to Ruth Wade, didn't you? I found out. It was a terrible shock. They never told me. I can't forgive Martin for that. Don't you mean that you can't forgive Martin for marrying at all, isn't it that? Martin's so weak. Anyone can dominate him. It was Ruth Wade who led him to all this terrible trouble. And you have been trying to protect him. He's my brother, Phillip, whatever he's done. Yes, you said that before when I wanted you to tell the police about Martin. Why won't you tell everything to the police, Helen? I'm frightened. It's better to face up to it. What else can you do, anyway? Do the police know I'm here? Did they follow you? I don't know. They were all gathered around Martin. There's a ship at the docks. I could get on it if you'd help me. - Oh, keep the police from following me. - Why run away? Can't you see it's like admitting... ...that everything the police have said about you is true? Please, Phillip! Help me! Darling, I'm trying to help you, can't you see that? I want you to be cleared. It matters terribly to me. Look, I'll back you up, it'll be all right. Come with me now. - Don't touch me. - Look, Helen, what's the matter with you? - Why are you frightened? - Let me go! Oh, Helen. - Now do you understand? - Yes, I think I understand. Everything the police told me about you is true, isn't it? You interfered with things that don't concern you. You concerned me. Very much once. I thought you needed help. - I suppose you killed Rice. - Yes, I killed Rice. The police told me that but I didn't believe them. They said you wanted to kill Ruth Wade, too. Yes, I did. - You're proud of what you've done. - Proud of it? Because I give no right to intrigue behind my back, because my own brother betrayed us for the sake of a girl, do you think I'm proud of that? Martin may be dying at this moment. He deserved to die. He ruined everything we worked for. He hated everything you worked for and so do I. Are you going to kill me for that? No, I need you. You're going to the police to tell them you couldn't find me. - So that you can get away. - Yes. Oh no, Helen. We're going to the police together. You're asking me to kill you. Am I? No, Phillip. Give up, Helen. Look out! Phillip, please... Thanks very much. Thanks for bringing me down, Morris. Now perhaps you'll leave me in peace for a change. - Perhaps you'll forgive me one day. - Don't see why I should. Did I tell you we're publishing a cheap edition of Red Sky All Day? Are you? In that case I forgive you. - Have a nice flight. - Oh, wait a minute! I nearly forgot something. Is that your button? Yes, I think it is. Where did you get it? It was in my flat. I must have dropped it off my blazer when I stayed with you last year. Funny I never noticed it. I suppose my wife sewed another one on. There are dozens others like that. - You can keep it if you like. - Very kind of you. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
