All rise. The court of Fayette County, Georgia is now in session. The honorable judge R.C. Lowry presiding. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Calling the case of the people of the state of Georgia versus Mr. Christopher Stone. Mr. Stone is represented by his attorney Mr. Aidman. Good morning, your honor. Mr. Stone, you're charged with the violation of Section 40-6-181 of the Georgia legal code. You were observed driving 105 miles per hour in a 45 mile per hour zone. And you were also seen in front of City Hall picking peaches off of Peach Tree City's honorary peach tree. Mr. Stone, how do you plead? Your honor, I would like to make the following motion. I move that we dismiss this case based on the fact that the prosecution has completely ignored my written request to discover the officer's notes. I have here a copy of that request written on August 9. What notes? He was clocked doing 105 and he had peach pits in his car. Please be seated, Mr. Aidman. Now, Mr. Stone, how do you plead? Mr. Stone! Oh. Guilty, your honor. Mr. Stone, you might be a big shot movie star out in Hollywood, but this is my courtroom. And you will conduct yourself accordingly. See, I get a lot of film folks come through my courtroom and well, they come to Georgia to make their movies. What do you need me to say, Stanley? Somehow they find ways to get themselves - in all kinds of trouble. - Hey, come on. All I'm asking for - is one meeting, okay? - So, I- Just one. Mr. Stone! If it's all right with Stanley, I would like to continue. Bye, Stanley. As I was saying. I get a lot of film folks throughout my courtroom and I was surprised to find out that your daddy is Walter Stone. I'm a big fan of your daddy's. Why, I've seen Walter on dozens of TV shows and movies growing up. His parts weren't always really big but he was such a great actor. Excuse me, your honor. My client has to be in hair and makeup by three. What does this have to do with a speeding ticket? I got to thinking. You know, Mayberry Fest is coming up next month, and as you know, your daddy was in a couple episodes. I don't know that Mayberry Fest is but can you just set the fine so we can get back to the set? Mayberry Fest. It's a wonderful week of all things Mayberry. Yeah yeah yeah, the TV show, I get it. The fine please? There'll be no fine. Excuse me? There'll be no monetary fine. Mr. Stone, I'm sentencing you to Mayberry Fest. Mr. Stone, you'll spend one week in Mayberry, North Carolina as a Mayberry legacy. You'll be representing your daddy by participating in all the festivities throughout the week. I object, your honor. My client's time does not allow for whatever this is. Fried chicken! Charlie, please. Mr. Aidman, as for you, one more outburst and I'll find you in contempt. Mr. Stone, you will attend Mayberry Fest, you will complete this probation or you'll find yourself back in my courtroom and you'll be looking at some serious jail time. Do you understand your sentence, Mr. Stone? Yes, your honor. You're fired. Again? This court is adjourned. ♪ Today is gonna be the greatest day ♪ ♪ I've ever known ♪ ♪ It feels good being king of the mountain ♪ ♪ Oh oh ♪ ♪ I know that everything's all right ♪ ♪ I know that everything's all right ♪ ♪ I'm living a charmed life ♪ ♪ Life ♪ ♪ A charmed life ♪ ♪ Today, don't you bring me no bad news ♪ ♪ I don't wanna know ♪ ♪ It's my world ♪ ♪ You're just a part of the show ♪ ♪ Oh oh ♪ ♪ I know that everything's all right ♪ ♪ I know that everything's all right ♪ ♪ I'm living a charmed life ♪ ♪ Life ♪ ♪ A charmed life ♪ You do what I tell you. You understand me? You're my agent, Stanley, not my therapist. No, I can't get out of it. Look, do you want to spend time in a backwoods jail? Didn't think so, bye Stanley. Welcome home, Mr. Stone. Who are you? Oh, I'm Shane, your new assistant. What happened to my old assistant? I don't know. Go get my bag. Yes, sir. There she is. Come here, come here Lucy, come see your daddy! Hey, did you miss me? Oh my goodness, 'cause I missed you, yes I did. Yes I did. You're such a good dog, yes, you're such a good doggy. Was this really Clark Gable's house? Get me a beer, will you? Come on. Yeah. Where's the kitchen? Come here, Lucy. Come on. Good girl. Lay down. Lay down, down. Lay down. Here's your beer, sir. So how was Georgia? See I have an aunt - Lay down. That lives in Augusta and I was invited out there last summer, but I didn't end up going because she has this feral bird Jimbo who bit me when I was a kid. And I don't know, I've just been terrified of birds ever since. Well, it gave me a rash And my aunt, she's immune to it, I guess - by now, but basically. - Hey, how's it going, man? Yeah, are you free this weekend? Yeah, my agent, he sent a script over for me to read but the walls are like closing in on me here, so I gotta get out. Yeah I'll pick you up tomorrow at eight. All right. Bring your board 'cause there's gonna be waves, man. All right, see you. Hey, Shane? Shane. Lucy, go get Shane. Go, go. Go get Shane. Go! Dumb dog. Shut up and listen to me! This is the part where you play the agent and I play the movie star! No, Stanley. Stanley, listen. I gotta go. I swear I have the world's laziest agent. Dude, you gotta chill. Well easy for you to chill. Your last movie didn't just tank at the box office. Yeah, I'm just saying though. Well, don't. ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Get out of my way ♪ Have you ever heard of Mayberry Fest? Oh, I'm supposed to sign autographs too. But not with my photos, no. See, they want me to sign photos of my dad. That's cool. No. Not cool. Bro, once we get in that water, all of your stress will just melt away. Hey, Stanley. Hey, did you get me that meeting with Barry yet? Why not? Stanley, no. Stanley, stop talking and listen to me, okay? This is a very important role for me. I mean did you see the weekend numbers from Satan's Game plan? Stanley, stop talking for like one second, you might just actually learn something. What are you talking about, I met with him three weeks ago. I didn't know it was his daughter! What up, superstar? Hey Larry, how you doin'? You want a beer? No, thanks. Bro, your house is 10 times the size of mine. You should be storing dad's stuff. And I found dad's first acting job that he ever had. This is so stupid. Have you ever heard of Mayberry Fest? Yeah, sure I have. Dad used to go to it every year until he got too old. You would know that if you ever bothered to stop by and see him. Can we not start this again? From what I hear, sounds like fun. Yeah, well maybe for old has been actors, but, I'm Chris Stone! You know what's gonna happen to me when I show up there? I'm gonna get mobbed. Remember this one? Mom tell you she's finally willing to sell the house? Yeah. And it's about time. Neighborhood's getting a little unsafe. Maybe we should get her a condo or something, maybe a senior living apartment? I already looked at a few but none that I want mom living in. I told you I'd help her find something when I get back from this stupid Mayberry thing. You know, this was one of dad's most memorable roles. Of all the shows that he was in, everybody remembers this one the most. It's like Mayberry Fest made him a big star. Look, I don't care about Mayberry Fest. And I certainly don't care about dad. Or his career. He never cared about mine. What are you talking about? He has never appreciated my accomplishments as an actor. Sure he has. Oh, really? You know what he said to me when I got my first big role in Shingletown? What? Nothing. Because he wasn't there. He's just a two bit actor who... Forget it. Come on man, how can you say that? He's your dad, man. No, Larry. He's your dad. He was your basketball coach, your scout leader. He took you fishing. And when you moved out it was me who watched him become an alcoholic. And it was me who heard him yell at mom every night! And it was me who watched him walk out the door and never come back. No, you had a dad, Larry. You had a dad. You gotta forgive him for that, bro. Mom has. That was a long time ago. Is there anything else you need? No. I don't need anything. But you do. See you, bro. Thank you, Mr. Stone. I've never been on a private jet before. Oh. Yikes. Mr. Stone? I'm Doug, I'm gonna be your driver for the week. Anything you need, I'm your man. Right. Oh, and this must be Shane? Yeah. Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. Your chariot awaits, boys, come on. Ugh. Sorry y'all gotta sit in the back seat but the front seat's a little busted. Y'all ever been to North Carolina before? No. It's really beautiful. Oh, we're gonna have a wonderful time. You are gonna love it. The people here are all so friendly. And the food, don't get me started on the food. But you know, you can really go anywhere you- Hey, Dan? It's actually Doug. Whatever your name is. Listen, if you, stop touching. If you don't mind, I got a bit of a headache from the flight. Say no more. Headache, I know, when you got a headache, all you want is a little peace and quiet. Well guess what, peace and quiet is what you are gonna get. All right, just sit back and relax and we will be there - in no time. - Doug! Doug! I will have you there in a jiffy. We're gonna have a wonderful time. Don't forget. I'll be right back here at 7:30 in the morning to pick you two up for the opening ceremony. Opening ceremonies? Yeah, you know, when the mayor declares the official start of the Mayberry Fest.

And it's always great to have 'em, but, this is our Grand Marshal for our parade. The daughter of Don Knotts, the lovely Karen Knotts! You know, the show was a huge part of my father's life. And he always thought of his fans, you guys, like family. And I know we miss him but we're grateful that he's still entertaining us today, right? You know my dad had a great career. He was a comic genius. And on top of all that, he had me! Well, I want you to remember to come see my show Tied Up In Knotts at the Royal Theater on Saturday, okay? I'll see you there. Thank you, Karen. It's so good to have you with us this week. We have another special guest with us this week, a first timer, first timer. Mr. Chris Stone! The son of Walter Stone from season three.

You know, it's amazing how one show can have such an effect on so many people. It sure had an effect on me. That's terrific. Oh no, that's yours. I'd be honored. Looks like you've got some competition. Okay Kate, you can let them in now. Thank you, Holly. Do you have a sharpie? Love you. Hey, I'm Ray field, and this is my wife Ginny. Good morning..

Sorry I haven't had a chance to meet you sooner. Things get a little crazy around here during Mayberry Fest. Yeah. But thank you so much for coming. Oh, it's my pleasure. You know, dad told me when he wasn't gonna be able to come here, how much he was gonna miss it, so, I thought I should come in his honor. That's so sweet. Yeah, I know.

Looks like you've just met- Shazam! Mr. Stone! I'm heading down to the pool, if you'd like to... Okay, I don't care about that, Stanley. Have you set up the meeting yet? Wait, what? Wait why is my mom calling you? No, no, no. I told her I'd find a place for her when I get back. Yeah. Just, tell her to stop looking. Hey, Mr. Stone! You forgot something. Thanks. Hey, good afternoon. How'd the autograph session go this morning? Long. And what you got planned for the rest of the day? Hey, I know who you are. You're the singing guitar player from that episode with the singing guitar player! No, no I'm not, sorry. Oh. Well would you mind taking our picture? Just push that button right there. Yeah, right there in front of me. Oh, it's shaggy back here. Smile. Cheese! Oh, thank you very much. - Yeah, that's a good one. - Thanks, buddy. Now that's a nice couple there. Hey, have you ever been over to the courthouse? No. Oh, oh, you wanna see that. Oh, it's just like the real set. I'll go with you! Swell. Right this way, folks. Try to stay together there. No stragglers now. Come right on in. Well, as you can see, here we have an exact replica of the Mayberry courthouse. Made possible by the Greater Mayberry Historical Society and Tourist Bureau. Limited! Limited, that's a good one. Feel free to sit at the desk and take a picture while you make your phone call to Sarah. Oh, and these over here, these are our maximum security cells. As you probably know, this is where we keep our most incorrigible prisoners. Here's one of our savage killers now. That's the greatest thing I've ever saw. Y'all are welcome to come back and have your picture taken in one of the cells. I suggest this one. What are you in for? Peaches. Pretty neat huh? Tell me something, Floyd. Allan, right? Yeah, but this week Floyd. We wouldn't want anybody to hear you calling me Allan. Floyd it is. Excuse me sir, can I get a picture? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Uh... could you move for just a minute, sir? Sorry, what? For just a second. All right, hold still here. Got it. Thank you so much. Thank you too, mister. So, Floyd. You've been doing this a long time, right? Yeah, I've been doing it quite a while, a lot of years. Can I ask you something? Oh, hey Mr. Schwamp. Sure, yeah, anything. Goooolly! How well did you know my dad? Your dad? Pretty good, I believe. Why you ask? I don't know, I just wanted to know if he ever talked about his career other than the show. He's a good talker, your dad is. - He's a really good talker. - Yeah. I figured that. What does he talk about? Acting, he loves acting. He talks about that. Had some great stories about some of the old shows he'd been in and stuff. Oh and he talked about you boys. He talked about his kids all the time. He's very proud of you. Matter of fact, he always made sure I knew when you had a new movie coming out. Always. Oh, look at that, I've gotta go. I'm a tenor in the Mayberry barbershop quartet. Hey, you wanna go? I'm good. All right, I'll see you later. You know, this is me. - Everybody knows it. - Awards are great. But it's really just knowing that my films are connecting with the hearts and minds. Don't mess this up, Stanley, don't you dare. Were you sick the day they taught this in agent school or something? Come on. Awards? Is that what you're going with? Wow. I'm just asking for one meeting. I mean how hard is that? What? Do you even want to be my agent, Stanley? Really? Why don't you start acting like it? Just set it up! Ugh. Come on Shane, let's have lunch. - Come on. - I'm just gonna actually go back to the... I nailed the audish, thank you. I nailed the audish. Yeah. And that's how I got cast as Lucky in Shingletown. From that moment on, I mean I can't walk down the street without someone asking for my autograph. Wow, that's amazing, Mr. Stone. You're telling me. Excuse me. See? Are you done with the ketchup? Yeah. Thank you. You know, you eat like a pig, right? Oh. I hate to ask you again. It's okay. My wife wants me to ask you. I know. Are you done with the mustard? All right, so give me the lowdown. What's the story with Kate? She seems nice. No, I mean like does she have a boyfriend or anything? Oh, yeah I wouldn't really- Oh my! I can't believe it! You're Chris Stone! Yes, thank you. I am Chris Stone. We've seen all of your movies. Death Figure Eight is my favorite. And Shingletown. So cute. Can we take a picture with you? Yes, absolutely. Give your phone to Shane. Oh yeah, of course. Come on around. All right, say Mr. Stone on three. - Here we go. - One, two, three. Mr. Stone! Got it. Thank you, - thank you. - You're welcome. All right, there you go. Wow. Did I tell you? I mean. Yeah, all the time. And how are things at this table? Great. Really good, Scott. Hey, Shane. Hey! Weren't you just- Oh, this is Chris Stone. Oh. - Hey Chris, how are you? - What's up, man? You know, from Death Figure Eight? Uh, No. Vegan Gringo? Mmm-mm. Shingletown. Shingle, no. He's Walter Stone's son. Walter Stone. Oh, you're Chris Stone, Walter's son. Yeah. Hey, you know what, your dad would eat here at the Loaded Goat every year for Mayberry Fest. Your dad's a wonderful man. Scott's the owner of the Loaded Goat. I figured that. Hey, Shane, next time, you know you get those wings half price on Wednesday. Hey, do me a favor, bring the check to me. Hey, lunch is on me today, gentlemen. - Thank you, Scott. - That's really kind of you. Thank you. Hey, it's my pleasure. Hey just do me a favor. When you see your dad, tell them I said hi for me, would you? I will. All right, awesome. Hey you guys have a great day. - Yeah, you too Scott, - Take care. - Thank you. - See you later. Wow. That was a great burger. Yeah. Ooh, just got to make a little pit stop first. Kate. Oh, hey. Hey. How's it going? Good. Good to see you. You look great today. Thank you. I just feel like there's some chemistry right here between you and me. Hey, Mr. Stone. Hey, Kate! Hey! Wow, you were just asking me about her - and here she is. - Nope. - That's so crazy. - Oh, no, what? I mean, sorry. He was dropped on his head when he was little. What is wrong with you? Well, you said, what's the story with Kate? And then I said, who ah, it's just- Stop! I don't need your help, okay? I'm Chris Stone. Watch this. Are you doing something with your voice? I don't get it. Shane. You're a regular guy, how would you do it? Huh, do what? Kate, how would you make a move on her? Oh, uh. Well, I don't think I would make a move on her. I'd probably just, you know, try and get to know her first. Yeah, doesn't that take time? Yeah. Usually. That's Walter Stone's kid! How are you? - We are big fans! - Oh, yeah. Of your daddy! - We sure are! - Oh. My name's Walter too but everybody calls me Walt! Nice to meet you. I'm Shirley. Okay. We are really big fans of the show. Yeah, what was Andy like? Did you ever visit the set? Y'all are very welcome. And you have a beautiful day. Did you ever visit the set? Kind of. Those are really, really great questions, and you know, I got a thing, so, gotta go. Hey, Doug. Hey, hey, can I borrow the car for an hour? - I guess that will be okay. - Thanks. Where are you going? I don't care. Anywhere but here. Okay. Hello? Good afternoon. Oh. Hey, uh. Sorry, I was just driving and this huge turtle- Is there something I can help you with? I doubt it. So the tourists, they don't make it out this far, huh? Tourists? Yeah, the fans of the show. Son, Mayberry's been around a lot longer than that TV show. Well why don't you tell that to the thousands back in town? I suppose there comes a time in everyone's life when things get complicated. Mostly by our own doing. And that's when folks start to look to our past. Mayberry... and the show, remind us of a time when things were simpler, when folks were friendlier to one another. And just laying back in the grass and looking up, watching the clouds roll across the sky was... Enough. You see, Mayberry... isn't just a place. It's... It's a state of mind. It's in Georgia, it's in Indiana. Heck, it's even in California. It's anywhere where folks treat one another with the dignity given them by their creator. It's about... looking beyond ourselves. Now is there something in particular you was looking for? No. Um... I got what I needed. You have a good day. Goodbye. Mr. Stone. To Don and Betty. - There you go. - Thank you so much. And tell your daddy hey for us. I sure will. Bye now. How are you? Good, partner. I'll take this one. Could you sign it Bobby-Ray? Absolutely, you got it. There you go. Hey, you're the guy in Shingletown. How's it going? Great, how about you? I'm good, fabulous. You got a couple options here. Hey. Hey. So, when can I buy you dinner? Oh. I actually have plans, I'm sorry. It's okay, we'll just do breakfast then. Look. Um... You're a nice enough guy and all and I'm really glad you're here. And I love your daddy. But, I'm just not interested. Sorry. Hey buddy. Can you give me a hand here? A little help? Yeah. Just get it, that's great. See y'all later. Oh, hey, Chris. Hey. I had to get out of there. If I stay in there too long they're gonna want me to cut somebody's hair. Mr. Schwamp. You know, when I was a boy I actually wanted to be a barber. Yeah but nobody would let me cut their hair. I used to go out back there and catch the neighborhood cats. Here an example of some of my work there. Yeah, looks nice. How long have you been playing Floyd? Hey look, a stranger in town! No, we've already met. No we haven't, I never forget a face. Yeah, I already told you, my name is- No, don't, don't, don't tell me, don't tell me. Uh... Let me see if I can... Give me the first letter. - C. - Cal! - No. - Clay? No. Cliff? No. - No, it's Chris. - Chris! See I told you I never forget a face. Amazing! Wow. Hey, look at that, Barney. Wow, I don't think I've seen that one before. I never forget a squad car. Yeah it's real nice. Reckon what happened to the original ones. They should have put one in the Smithsonian Institute or something. Yeah, I guess. Oh, there's a treasure there. It's a shame, a real shame. You know, I know where there's an original. Huh? Right over in Wilmington, North Carolina. An original squad car? Yeah. It's at an old movie studio. I know 'cause I shot a Western there last year. You're sure it's the real deal? A real Mayberry squad car. Yeah. - In Wilmington? - Yeah. I'd love to see that. There's a national treasure is what that'd be. Yeah. You guys wanna see it? See what? The squad car. Oh. Yeah, I'm in. All right listen, we can go tonight. Be back by the morning. What'd you say? Yeah, I'm in. What about you, Barney? Yeah, let's do it. All right, now we're talking. All right, listen. I need you to go to my hotel, pick me up at 10:30, all right? 10:30, all right. - Sounds good. - Wait a minute, wait. I don't have a car. I rode here with Otis. We'll take my car. Good evening, friends. You're listening to the soothing sounds of Mount Pilot. Ooh, oh, turn up the radio, Barney. I just love Leonard Blush. Can't this thing go any faster? Faster? The speed limit's 65. Yeah but you are going 50. Well how would it look if a lawman got pulled over for speeding? Besides, this here's a delicate machine. You treat her right, and she'll treat you right. Yeah, she's a beauty. And it's delicate, delicate, yeah. She's just a replica. You wanna nip it, Floyd. You guys brought a change of clothes, right? Of course. ♪ Everybody loves the spring ♪ You know, Barney, the other day, I got to thinking. How come Ernest T's name is always Ernest T. Bass? It's never just Ernest Bass or Ernest. It's always Ernest T. I mean I know people with names like Sally Mae or Mary Anne. But I've never known anybody with just a name and an initial. Well, you know what I think? Yeah, what's that? What if Ernest T. Bass' daddy's name was Ernest S. Bass? Hey, that's good. You got something there. So his granddaddy's name would be Ernest R. Bass? And his great granddaddy's name would be Ernest P. What are you guys talking about? Who cares? He's a character from a TV show, he's not real! Family's real. What? I said family is real. Floyd's right, family is real. This family. In fact, family is pretty much all a man's got. He ain't much without it. Well this is trespassing! We're not stealing anything. I should be home in bed. C'mon, let's go. Well, looks like the coast is clear. Get down. Go back. Go on, take a look. I can't believe it. It's beautiful. You wanna sit in it? Oh I don't think I should, I can't do it. Could I? It's amazing. You think he would sell it? Oh no. No, the owner of the studio told me he's had a lot of offers over the years but he won't sell it. This puppy's staying right here with the studio. What was that? Was that the security officer? I don't think so. Follow me. - No, the green wire. - Move your hand! - I was the one who graduated high school? - Shut up! Looks like those guys are trying to steal that car. Well, we gotta call the police. What, are you crazy? You wanna get us arrested too? Well. We can't just let them steal it, can we? Oh, no, no, no, those are real crooks in there. I don't think we have any other options, man. We can't just walk away. Oh yes we can. You got that one bullet, don't you? It's not real, Floyd. But they don't know that. Well they don't know I only have the one either! Shh, guys. Come on, you can do it, Barney. My name's Warren. His name's Warren. That's funny, isn't it? I don't get it. Well, you see on the show... And I don't care. All right, listen, Warren. What would Barney do? There it is. There it is. Yeah, there you go Barney. We'll be right here. Now listen. When you get into prison, I'm sorry, position, I'll hit the lights, okay? You got this. Come on. Come on, you got it Barney. Little courage, little courage, Barney. Oh yeah baby, come on, come on. Freeze! Nobody move! Out of the car. Out of the car, you on the other side, come around. Keep your hands in the air. Keep your hands in the air! I thought you said there was only one guard. Hands in the air, buddy! I think our rent-a-cop is a little jumpy. Keep your hands in the air. Keep your hands in the air! Are you gonna shoot us all? I don't think he's gonna shoot us, Billy Ray. I think you're gonna put that gun on the ground and turn around real slow-like. You best listen. This isn't worth dying over. All right boys, let me see your hands. Get'em up. Come on, get'em up! Not you, them. Hey, stop right there, stop right there! What is this? Back up. There we go, Floyd, all right. Hold it right there, slick. Nice job, Barn. Thanks. Wait a minute. Aren't you Chris Stone? Hands up! Nobody move! Nice job. Oh, thank you, thanks. Fortunately for you, your partner was able to get himself free and give us a call. Partner? Oh yeah, my partner. Oh yeah, well, I knew I had to step it up and neutralize the situation. Besides, nobody gets a drop on old Barn when I got this bad boy by my side. You know, the number one thing to remember when fighting crime here in the big city is to always be- Hold on a second, hold on a second. What do you mean the guy says he's the only security guard here? Woohoo! Oh man! Barney, you better slow down. This is a delicate machine, remember? Yeah! Yeah, you don't wanna get a speeding ticket. You wanna nip it, Floyd! Nip it! Nip it! Woo! Oh, man. Yeah. I think we made it. Hello? Oh, hey Doug. Wait, what time is it? Yeah, yeah, just give me five minutes. Be right there. Hey, stop slouching. I'm paying you by the hour here. You think Briscoe's gonna help you, think again, pal. Can I go now? No. Do you mind? Just, all right. Say Mayberry! Mayberry. You ain't rubbing my head. Hey, come back here, you little brat. All right, that's it. Watch this. And you, watch this. Maybe you guy'll learn something. You know, film making, it's not done in a vacuum, okay? I mean, you're on the same team here. Come on. Where's your Mayberry spirit? Now, let's have some fun. Hey folks! Come on in, how you doing? Welcome to Mayberry Fest. Which photo would you like me to sign? Oh, fantastic. Mom, I'm not saying it has to be a big house. And please don't worry about the money. You know you're not gonna be happy in a senior living complex. Don't worry, I'll find you the house of your dreams. Okay, I love you too. Bye, mom. Hey, dad. Yeah, I know. I was filming a movie, and uh... Yeah I'm still here. I uh... Guess where I am. I'm at Mayberry Fest. No, not as a fan. I'm actually representing you. Yeah, the people here are amazing. Really kind, and, they want me to tell you hi, by the way. Kate? She's great. She's amazing, yeah. Yeah, I'll tell her. I gotta get going. Um... I just wanted you to know where I am. And maybe I'll call you when I get back to LA. I will, yeah. Okay. Bye. Man, how did you get those great drone shots in your film? Oh, I had a good friend help me out with those. You're kidding, that's great. How long did it take you to do your film? Oh, forever. You know, you and I could be brothers. Aw, don't make me howl. Morning, Chris. - Hey. - Hey. Morning, Kate. Do you have a second to talk? Absolutely. Great. What's up? Well I wanted to apologize for the other day. I shouldn't have been so short with you. It wasn't very neighborly. It's totally okay. I shouldn't have been so forward, that was my fault. Look, I know who you are. I looked you up when I heard you were coming. I know you're a movie star, a big movie star. Well I just wanted to apologize. No worries, okay? I had it coming. Well thank you again for being here. I know you're very busy. Nonsense. Anything, anything for dad. So... Well Mr. Stone, if you're free around two, we can grab some coffee. I'd love that. Great. Bye. See ya. - Hi. - Hi. Craig, give him the elevator pitch. - Okay. - Hey, picture this. Yup? You're driving in the car in the middle of the desert. - Yeah. - Middle of nowhere. And all of a sudden it breaks down. Okay. And a beam of light comes down. Big beam, big beam. Big beam. And, all of a sudden you look up and you see. Thank you so much for the photos, Mr. Stone. Hey, it was my pleasure. And hey I'm pulling for you in that promotion, Phil. Thank you, Mr. Stone. - All right. - Thank you. It's Chris, by the way. And you're welcome. Thank you, bye. Bye. Stanley! Talk to me, babe. Oh. Well, cancel it. I don't want it anymore. Yes, Stanley, I understand how hard you worked to get this meeting for me and I really appreciate it, seriously. But, I don't know I think I'm gonna take some time off. We can talk about it when I get back to LA. Okay. Well, talk to you later, Stanley. Where is he now? Shane. Shane, where are you? Oh, hey Mr. Stone. Um... I'm at, I'm not really sure. Hey Roger, where am I at again? Son, you're at Twin Bridges Golf Club. The finest gold club in the state of North Carolina. Oh yeah, I'm at Twin Bridges Golf Club, the finest- - I don't care. Shane, let me ask you something. Do you like making minimum wage? Then I think you should get your butt back here. Right now. Okay. Uh... Gotta go, fellas. Well, you already have the ball teed up, son, you might as well hit it. Oh. Okay. Oh, there it is. Oh, Chris Stone. Hey. Hey. Am I late? No. No, not at all, I was early. They have really good coffee here. I don't drink coffee. Oh, okay. I really just wanted to get to know you, and so. Oh sorry. Just a sec. Terry needs to see you at the office right now. Thank you. I'm so sorry, but I have to go back to the office. Oh. Okay. But um, would you like to walk with me? We could take our time. I'm sorry, this festival is a really big thing around here. Big isn't the word for it. What? Oh, nothing. I'm sure this seems pretty silly to you. No. No, not at all. Okay. Yes, I admit it. Yes at first this all seemed a little, a little nutty? But I think I get it now. I don't know what it is, but I really like this town. Just must seem pretty boring compared to Los Angeles. It has its charms. So, tell me. Why isn't there a Mr. Kate? Picky, I guess. Why isn't there a Mrs. Stone? Picky, I guess. I have to go. Oh, okay. It was really nice talking with you, Chris. Yeah, same here, same. I'll see you later. Okay. Hi! Hi! All right Stanley, I'll talk to you when I get back. Mr. Stone. Judge. Sure looks like sentencing you to Mayberry Fest has turned out great for all of us. In the next two weeks you'll get a document from the court that states you've completed your probation. Judge, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Probation? What did he mean probation? Well. You were forced to come here? Yes. I can't believe it. How stupid am I? You don't understand. Oh no, I understand. You're a bigger phony than I thought you were. Mayberry Fest is for people who love this show. - Kate, just- - No. I don't even wanna know why the judge sent you here. Hopefully you got to see what real thoughtful people look like, honest people. Something you know very little about. What'd I miss? Chris just got chewed out by Kate for lying about why he was here at Mayberry Fest. Shazam! So you didn't want to be here? I didn't want to at first, but, What? I thought we were friends. We are friends, Barney. I mean, Warren. Look, yes, it's true, I was sentenced to be here. But being here, it's caused me to look at myself and others so differently. I'm not the same man that I was when I first got here. Well, you are a touch more neighborly. Yeah and he don't hold his finger up when I'm trying to talk no more. Well. Kate, she might, well she may hate me for life, but, I just don't want you guys thinking that we aren't friends. Because we are. We're friends. Oh well. You know, it's like we always say. Once you've been to Mayberry Fest, you're family. Thanks, Floyd. Allan. That's right. You'll be at the talent show tonight, right? No. Unfortunately, sorry, I've got something I gotta do. And then I gotta get on my flight back to LA. Oh, man. Well, I guess this is goodbye then. It's been great having you here with us and we hope you'll come back next year. Oh, yeah. We'd really love to have you. Thanks. Well I now know why this show's been so popular for all these years. It's nice people like you. Somebody help me. Where you going, toots? Come back! You're such a doll, doll. Wait, wait, wait! Thanks Doug, I appreciate it. You are very welcome and I'll be back at 4:30 to pick you up for the airport. Perfect. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, Stanley. Look, I'd like you to get a hold of someone for me okay? You know, this Mayberry Fest thing is wild. I did not know this was going on. I'm so excited that you get to experience it with us. Just tell me that Ernest T. Bass character isn't staying here. He is, is that gonna be a problem? Okay, you're gonna be in room 216. Enjoy your stay, Mr. Bowden. Thank you. Thanks Stanley. Hi. Good afternoon, Mr. Stone. Could I trouble you for some stationery and an envelope? Of course. Here you go. Thanks. Excuse me, Mr. Stone? Um... I was wondering. Can I have your autograph? Of course you can. It's okay. I've got it. What's your name? My name? My name, uh... It's Jill. There you go, Jill. To the citizens of Mayberry. Thank you for showing me the Mayberry spirit. Kate. You have every right to be upset with me and I understand if you'll never forgive me. And you'll make sure Kate gets this? Of course. Thanks, Doug, I appreciate everything. You've been great. Oh, by the way. Take your car to this guy. He'll fix your front seat. It's on me. Wow, thanks, Mr. Stone! It's Chris, by the way. Oh, and don't let Shane sleep in. His flight leaves at 11. Shane? Didn't he tell you? Tell me what? Everybody step back! Step back a little bit. Break it up now, break it up. You heard the man, give him some room! Scooch, buddy, scooch! Well that's the car from the studio! Yeah, it is! - It is. - It looks like the real deal. This is exciting. If this car is real, Oh, Jim will know. It's real. It's real! Hey hey! Wait a minute, it's a note from Chris! It says, "To the citizens of Mayberry Fest. Please accept this gift for showing me that there is a Mayberry in all of us." Aw. - Yeah. - All right. There's more, there's more. "PS, if you're ever in Los Angeles, look me up." Now I know you got everything. But, for your birthday, I got your favorite. Tallest peanut butter and jelly sandwich ever. Of course. If it's from you, I'm sure it's amazing. It is. Sorry. It's mom.

The door will be open. It's a guy I met at Mayberry Fest. And he came to see you? Very funny. Did he loan you money? He's actually a Floyd tribute artist. He's pretty good too. I was actually serious about the money question. Of course you were. Allan, hey! Hey! Great to see you, buddy. Great to see you. This is my brother Larry. Allan, pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Wow. Nice place you got here. Oh, thanks. I'm actually thinking about selling the place. Too small, I guess. Hey, I've got a surprise for you. Okay. Hey, you old son of a gun! Warren? This is quite a treat. Man, it's great to see you. Good to see you, bud. This is my brother Larry. Larry, nice to meet you. Warren, it's a pleasure. So what brings you two nuts to LA? Every couple of years a bunch of us come up here to California and do all the Mayberry stuff. Yeah we go up to Franklin Canyon Reservoir where they filmed the opening credits. We go out to the old 40 Acres back lot where you know, it's all Mayberry stuff. I'm really excited you guys stopped by, this is awesome. Thanks. Hey, I'm sorry about your dad. Walter was a great guy and he's really missed. Thank you. Yeah, the last three months we had with him were really great. I needed those. And I've been autographing more of my dad's photos than my own since he passed. Well, we're not interrupting anything then, are we? No, not at all, seriously. Oh great, 'cause first off, I want to say thanks for getting us that squad car, man. It is sweet! - You're welcome, man. - Yeah, it's great. How did you get the guy from the studio to sell it to you? You said he wouldn't sell it, it had to stay there. We made a deal. A deal? I bought the studio. - What, are you kidding? - You're kidding. No! - Oh, man! - Wow.

Yeah, at least. It was condemned by the state. It's just a monument now, you can't go in. There's nobody inside. But I spoke to him, so... I talked to him. Oh you had me on that one.
