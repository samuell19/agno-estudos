** [rings] Oh. What can I do for you? Just petrol, is it? [Eastern European accent] No petrol. [RUSTY] Huh? No. It's my car. The engine, it goes... all the time. Noise is bad, no? Oh, yeah, yeah, the noise is bad, but, um-- I don't want to break down. No, no, of course you don't. I'm heading up north. See family. Oh, yeah, look... um, I'm sorry, mate, but, uh... the auto shop next door is closed. I can have a look at your car tomorrow. No. I can't wait. My father-- he is sick as a dog. I'll pay you. In cash? Cash. [RUSTY] Spark knock, they call it. Too much heat in the old combustion chamber. Head gasket could fly out, piston might crack. Always an issue with these high-mileage motors. Bought it secondhand, you say? Yesterday. Sure is an interesting color for a car. What do you call it? Bronze? Chocolate. Lucky you swung by this way. Like you said yourself, you don't want to break down. It'll be gettin' dark soon. How much? Well, let's have a look. All in all, it's gonna cost you $200. That was a very special cleaner I used. Top-quality detergent all the way from Europe. $200? Mate, I've got a business to run. Now, I gave you a fair price. Your car's fixed, isn't it? A little bird said you were greedy. What? [Body thuds] ** [country rock playing] Still fixing the lock. He's been at it for ages. [MARILYN] Yeah? I thought you'd gone home by now. I'm still waiting on Annie. Where is she? She's outside on the phone. It's trouble with her boys. Marilyn, leave that to me. I'm the one stuck here-- I've got to keep busy, or I'll get nauseous. You're too nervous. You're gonna tire yourself out. I got him a cake. He's only been gone six days. Isn't that a tad excessive? This could be one of the most important nights of my life. I've gotta do something, right? You didn't bake it yourself, did you? Of course not. Don't want to poison him. Girls! What do I have to do to get a shot around here? Oh, another bourbon coming right up. [Whispering] Marilyn... who's that young fella playing pool? He doesn't look like a regular to me. It's Gus Summers. It's Dorothy's youngest. [ANNIE] No. Is it really? [MARILYN] He was a shy boy in school. Heh heh. I bet you there's a real animal under that quiet exterior. Yeah? Oh, yeah. He was so over-mothered. I bet he's just dying for some release. There you go, Annie. Uh, it's on the house. I'm feeling rather generous. Mmm! You're too good to me, Marilyn. Right. How are the puppies lookin'? Puppies? Got enough bounce, do you think? Uh... yep. They look great. Well... if you've got it, flaunt it. [Chuckles] [light bulb buzzing] [SLIM] Well, you've got some nerve. You were supposed to come round here after the bar closes. Weren't that the arrangement? I bet Rusty isn't even at the morgue. And everyone wants to get paid. Like my good-for-nothing wife. Can't sleep the night before she gets her allowance. Like a kid at Christmas. You married? You ever been? No. Oh, Christ, you're not missing much. Thinner wallet. Microwave dinners. Sex on your birthday. [MARILYN] We've been living together two years. Two years next month. You're like a wife already. Yeah, a wife with no wedding. Travis should know better. So, what did he say exactly when he called you last night? Well, he said he had something real important to ask me. Emphasis on the "real." Sure sounds like a proposal to me. You know, I reckon the only reason he went to Mumbai to visit his parents was to get that ring. What ring? The one worn by his grandmother-- it's been passed down through the family. Like an heirloom. Holly... it's gorgeous. You ready to go, Miss Burns? Yeah, I'll just tell the boss I'm off. [HOLLY] How's everything with the kids? Don't ask. I've got to drive all the way out to Lithgow and pay this brat of a babysitter 15 bucks an hour-- you believe that? Just to lay on the couch, watch TV, and fool around with the boyfriend. Sounds like heaven to me. So... Andelko still calling the shots up north, is he? Well, I guess so. He gave me your number. Bought me a nice six-gun. Manufactured in 1898. Real fancy. You said. Slim, I'm out. Damn it, Marilyn. Don't you knock? Sorry, I didn't think-- Can't you see I've got company here? I'm headed home. I just thought I'd let you know. Yeah, right. So, you don't need a ride home tonight or nothin'? Annie's dropping me off. Holly's staying till close. Holly? Yeah, good. All right, well, you tell Annie to drive safe and stay out of trouble. Oh, and, um, that guy's still fixing the busted lock. He said someone's gonna call about changing that glass first thing Monday. Is that it? That's it. Night, darlin'. [Door closes] Right. What happened... with the lock? Teenagers. That's what happened. Last night, breaking in and stealing booze. Tsk. It ain't the first time, neither. You might remember me telling you the other day when you got into town. Damn kids. A good hidin' would set 'em straight. I guess you want your cash. Bet you can't wait to get out of here, eh? Three days, and you're itching to crawl back. What do you make of this little town, anyhow? You never gave me your opinion of my adopted home. This trip is business, not pleasure. Well, that's a shame. Plenty of fun to be had around here. You just gotta know where to look, is all. I bought a car. Hmm. New automobile, eh? Chocolate. What? The color. Chocolate. Yeah. Well, that sure is an interesting color... for a car. Do you not want to count it? Here. Consider it a bonus. No, no. I'm done with this, finished. Just take it, all right? It's a long drive back home. If you don't want it, give it to your girlfriend. Shit, you got a girlfriend, don't you? Before you go... there's something I want to know. Did he suffer at all-- Rusty? No. He was a crook, you know. You said. Never made good on his payments, one excuse after another. Ain't no one gonna miss him. Finance should never come between friends, and I told him, too, I warned him. I said, "Rusty, there's two kinds of man here." I've got me fingers in all kinds of pies, all manners of business-- bar-running, dope-dealing, high-class gambling. I'm a proprietor, a profiteer, a pioneer, and I'm an entrepreneur, damn it! And ain't no bludger gonna tarnish my reputation. Slim Walding ain't no sucker! What? Oh, Christ. Happens when I get in a fluster. My wife usually brings it out of me. Oh, Jesus. Remember to go out at the back while you can. And don't order no drinks, neither. I don't need customers getting all suspicious. Fuckin' Croatian. [MARILYN] To be honest, I just don't know how to prepare for something like this. Well, when he drops down on one knee, you'd best act surprised. Yeah. Break his heart otherwise. I say you get the house all ready for his arrival-- real romantic, you know? Fresh sheets on the bed, light some candles. Make sure you show plenty of skin. You'll be at it like rabbits. Annie! What? It's your engagement night. Enjoy it while it lasts. [Indistinct chatter] Night. ** [beeping] [TRAVIS] Hey, sweetheart. Letting you know I'm on my home, and I shouldn't be too long, I reckon. Just stopped for coffee, and... my phone's run out of battery. I can't wait to see you. I missed you so much. Bye, baby. [Beep] ** [beep] [creaking] [creaking] [creaking] [gasps] [creaking] [creaks] [creaking] [rustling] * Oh, my Lord, have you heard about * * Heard about Good Town? * Everybody's happy and you never see a frown * * There in Good Town * Oh, my Lord, I've packed my bags * * Packed my bags for Good Town * * Once I'm there I'm never goin' back * * Goin' to Good Town [music continues indistinctly] [tires screech] [line ringing] - [ANNIE] Hello? - Annie? - Hello? - Annie, it's Marilyn. Oh, Marilyn, honey. Did you-- - It's my cake. - Cake? I left it in your car on the back seat. Shit, I see it. - You still driving, then? - Yeah. Don't worry. I'll turn around right now. Oh, I'm so sorry, Annie. I'm such an idiot. It's fine, honey, fine. Is he back yet--Travis? No, not yet. I'm expecting him soon, though. Okay, well, I'll put my foot down, be there before you know it. Annie, you're a godsend. Yeah, well, a girl only gets proposed to once... if she's lucky. I'll see you soon, okay? - Okay. - Bye. Bye. [Door creaks] ** [engine won't start] [blues music playing] [banging on door] [turns music off] Travis? Trav-- [banging on door] [rattling] Travis? [Rattling stops] ** [screaming] No! [Screaming] Oh, God! Ohh! [HOLLY] Hey, Slim. Christ, Holly. Can't you see I'm busy here? Sergeant Byrd is here to see you. Rolly, too. What, now? Yeah, now. Listen, uh, tell 'em I'm tied up, I'm busy, and I just can't see them. Sergeant. Constable. How the devil are you? Can I get youse a drink? Something stiff, perhaps? Nothin' for us, thanks. We're in uniform. Of course. I'll take a bourbon, darlin'. Black Crow. Well... I thought you'd be retired by now, eh, Sarge? Well, I never was much of a golfer. Pussy's game. No contact. So... what brings you out this way so late? [BYRD] Rusty. Rusty Sebb. Late this afternoon, down at the service station, there wa-- Some ass on her, eh? So, what's that about Rusty? He's dead. Murdered. Yeah, I know. How so? Small town. News travels fast. Come off it, Slim. You're sweatin' all over. It's a glandular thing I got, you know that. Ask Doc Tully. And just what are you implying anyway? Well, everybody knows you two had a falling out. Ain't no secret. I forgave him. That's what I did. That right? That's what friends do. They forgive each other. So, when was the last time you buddies went hunting cod? I've been here since midday, working. And I've got a bar full of witnesses-- staff, customers. All I know is, we lost a valuable member of this community today. There was some kind of robbery, and Rusty was killed. Robbery? Yeah. [BYRD] There was no holdup. There was no money taken from the till. This homicide was personal. For Christ 's sake, Rusty was shot in the face. In the face?! Point blank. City police are all over it as we speak. Shouldn't take them too long, given the evidence. Evidence? Perp dropped his gun fleeing from the scene. It won't be long before they get a match. Must've panicked-- all that blood and bone. Enough to turn anyone's stomach. [Laughing] Oh, come on. Have a bit of respect. No, look, I apologize, Sarge, I do. Yeah, you're right. Terrible, terrible thing, yeah. Just can't believe the sucker dropped his murder weapon. [Knocks on door] Marilyn, honey? It's Annie. I've got your cake. At it like rabbits. [Car starts] [car drives off] [sniffs] ** [Marilyn whimpers] This your house? You and your husband Travis, yes? He's not my husband. [STRANGER] No? No, not-- not yet. This is my childhood home, this house. It belonged to my father. Where is he? Dead. Passed on a couple years back. My mother died, too. A long time ago now. I was just a baby. I still feel as though she's here, though. Sometimes I hear things... at night. Where's your car? I told you before, remember? Travis has it. He should be home any minute now. You can take it. He won't mind. What about the bike? The bike? Motorbike. Outside... in the yard. It's old. It's junk, really. Travis was fixing it up over summer. Does it operate? I think so. Then where are the keys? Travis has them. Keeps them on a keychain. You're not gonna do anything to us, are you? You'll let us go, right? We won't say anything to anybody. [Knock on door] Chairs are stacked, floor's mopped. Yeah, good job, darlin'. Do you want me to do the tills? Nah, leave it. I'll lock up... and have me a drink. I'll say good night, then. Why don't you, uh... step inside? Shut the door behind you. Slim. I thought we were past all this. We've got a new deal going. 50% of my tips until I can pay-- Well, it ain't workin' for me. Besides, it's my money. And I'm grateful, you know I am. I just don't think-- [SLIM] Look, tell you what-- we'll settle the debt the old way, my way. We'll scratch the interest. 100 bucks each time we play. Shit, you'll wipe your slate clean by the end of the month. How many spanks? Well, let's be fair here. You pick a number, I pick a number, and we add 'em together. Single digits? Single digits. Fine. So... what number have you got? One. You? Nine. Oh, I did miss this. Just... go easy, all right? I could barely sit down after last time. And please... take off those rings. Ooh. You sure are demanding, girl. There's only one boss around here. Name's on the door. Uh-uh, no, no, no, no. On your knees, and give me the crawl. That's it. Eyes on me. [Grunting] [slap echoes] [clatter] ** [door closes] [soft rattling] [sighs] ** [coughs] [grunting] What? No, no. Listen to me. I've been set up. You understand what I'm sayin'? This fuckin' cowboy-- who is he? Yeah, look, put Andelko on the phone. Yes, now! I'm not playin' around here. Hang on a sec. I'll call you back. [Car door closes] [twig snaps] [starts engine] Oh, Christ. [Screaming] Shh, shh, shh! It's me, it's me. I got you, I got you. Oh, Slim. So, where is he, eh? He upstairs? What? What's going on? What's going on-- Shh! Calm down. It's all right now. Why are you here? What's happening? I seen the cars, just up the road there. Cars? What--What cars? Travis' car. And the chocolate one. Is he dead--Travis? What happened? What? What are you talking about? [SLIM] Listen. Where is he--the Croatian? He left. He's gone. Left?! What's happening? [SLIM] He left where? Where is Travis? - Where did he go?! - Where? Where did he go?! Slim! [Grunting] ** Aah! [Screaming] [door creaking] [creaks] [doorknob rattles] ** [door closes] [click] [footsteps] [door closes] ** [gunshot] ** **
