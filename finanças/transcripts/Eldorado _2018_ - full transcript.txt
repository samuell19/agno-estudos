Switzerland was surrounded by world war. I missed my father. He was a soldier somewhere on the border. I didn't know what a border is. My mother took me with her to the freight yard to choose a refugee child. They were all thin and grey, wearing numbers around their necks. I wanted a big brother. But we got a girl who spoke very differently. You, Giovanna. You've learned Italian very well. But do you understand us... really? That's the reason... you are the reason Giovanna, that Fm making this journey to see what I don't really want to see. We do understand that you are tired, that you have been going through a lot. Yet, we are doing all within our possibilities to make you as comfortable as possible. We apologize for the sleeping conditions and the toilet services. Now we would like to ask you to be patient a little more. Flight team ready for takeoff! John the Baptist came and the sinners believed him. We pray for each of us, that the hope in our hearts will soon come true. Let us pray. Lord, give us the Holy Ghost. Lord, send us the Holy Ghost so that Thy word bears rich fruit of salvation. Sailors' prayer! Lord of heaven and the abyss, whom wind and waves obey, we men of the sea and of war, Italy's officers and seamen, on this holy ship, armed by the homeland, lift up our hearts to You. What does the Pope say about what you're doing here? The Holy Father's opinion came up at the audience on Wednesday. On this occasion he praised Operation "Mare Nostrum." He described it as remarkable work for our brothers seeking happiness. Bearing: 305. Flight team ready for takeoff! I'm on this ship because of you, Giovanna. But you stay on the other side. When I got sick as a child, I always had the same dream. I'm rowing in a tiny boat in a boiling semolina soup that gets steadily thicker and bubbles until the boat tips and I fall in. Even in the dream, I knew, tomorrow I'll have a fever. It was hard to look you all in the eye. Who shall we take? The big one? No, not a girl. Maybe he's ill, or too sad. Or too strong. The Red Cross had already made lists. So it didn't get like a dog rescue shelter. And why are they looking at my new mountain boots like that? It was only then I saw what shoes they were wearing. At home, you were put into the bath at once. I could see all your ribs. And lots of red spots. Mama sent me out. You had scabies. And you cried every night. Only very quiet“!-. Papa is dead. And my Mama is in Milan, ill. In a bombed-out house. And who would look for food in the streets for Mama now? When the soldier came in, you ran away. But it was just my Papa on leave. Papa had to return to the border and once again I wasn't allowed to come. Mama sent him my picture of the border. Where is the war? Where are the broken houses and people? We support neither the good nor the bad side in the war. That's why there are no bombs in Switzerland. I only found out about the deal behind the “Children-Trains“ decades later. For every Jewish Refugee who had made it to Switzerland, with a visa to America and a boat ticket, Switzerland had to feed three hungry war children. So that the fascists would let the Jewish people get to the harbor. First the life jackets! No, everybody wait... Don't let anyone out! Don't let anyone out! Hey, hey! Sit down! Sit down! What's your name! She can't stand. Can you look for the shoes... of this woman? I counted 104 saved. How many? -I get 104, okay? Yes, it's okay. Itch? You have itch? You have diarrhea. You'll be treated. Pain? You have allergy to medicine? No problem? Paracetamol. It's okay? Sit down. The first day, you said "thank you" after the soup, and left the table. You thought the meal was over. Everything was rationed. Two days a week, meat was forbidden. AH over the country. Fresh bread was no longer allowed to be sold, it had to be two days old, so it wasn't eaten greedily. No extra food stamps were given for refugees. We had to share with you. BREAD COUPONS But Mama could buy black market butter from a farmer. To fatten up your ribs a little. Black butter! Black butter! But on bread it turns yellow! Pd made a discovery that confused me. Everyone called themselves "I." But surely, I am I? Suddenly, everyone else was "I" as well. Even you! But I had a problem with "give us our daily bread." Who is “us”? I counted all the family, including you, of course, Giovanna, and my sister Ursula. Then my friends, the neighbors. The bad neighbor, too? It'd be better to count people in Africa, they were hungry. I kept on counting. Sometimes it was afternoon before I got to "amen." And all of them got nothing to eat, because I was too lazy to pray for them. You need flour, too, Marcelino. Not everywhere has bakeries. We take the castaways' fingerprints with scanners. These prints... then get compared with the Italian data bank, and are checked against the European Data Bank in Brussels. According to the Dublin Regulation, a foreigner who arrives in a country has to stay right there. If he applies for asylum in Italy, he can't apply for it in Norway tomorrow. He has to be accepted by Italy. And if he already has relatives in Norway? I'm not allowed to comment on that. We have to take fingerprints, that's what the regulations say. Starboard, stop! Port, back a little! POM, stop! Take your hands and feet inside the boat. There are lifejackets! Keep out, keep out! There are lifejackets for everyone! Hey! Sit down! A difficult day awaits us today, too. Just like yesterday. We'll be working until three in the morning again, like every day. But nevertheless, we shave every morning. Let's not lose our good habits! Thank you! Officers, attention! Hello. At ease. Please continue. There are new developments in the coalition that supports the USA in the bombing of Iraq and Syria. In Iraq, two of |S's mobile oil refineries were hit. We assume that with mobile installations on trucks they can refine crude oil valued at 1.5 Million US dollars a day. On the Syria-Iraq border? -Yes, exactly. On the black market, they would receive... Baby? Pregnancy, madame? Only you? This one, and another girl. -Two girls. If you promise collaboration we will promise you to arrive as soon as possible to Italy. I can understand it's a long journey that you have. But every day gonna be better. We will not promise you paradise but every day gonna be better. Okay? Welcome! Madam! Madam, madam, there. Has the battery fallen out? He was shot at in Libya. -Can you tell me about your journey? In Libya we had to stop at a checkpoint. They just shot at us. We wanted to go to Italy, across the sea. They stole our money, our telephones, everything. They were armed. You hope to go where, now? I have relatives in Denmark. I want to go to them, God willing. And your wife, where is she? -What? Where is your wife? -His wife? In Lebanon. Help us to not do fingerprints! I have risked my life to travel to Denmark, not to give fingerprints here. Can you write me the phone number of his family? My phone is gone... I left my family behind. And suddenly it was all over. Your time was up. You had to go back again. "One mustn't form too much of an emotional connection," said the woman from the Red Cross. I will miss you, Marcelino. But I'm looking forward to seeing my Mama, too. Now that she's almost well again, finally. Mama is happy that I'm round with chubby cheeks, but now I am ill. We've no money for heating, and the windows are broken from the bombs. Still. But in bed it's not so cold. I forgot my toothbrush at your house. Could you send it to me? Please? I always say, the director as well as the commander, are only passengers on the ship. After a year, they leave again. We're the real crew, we NCOs. Because we stay on board for five, six, seven or ten years. How long have you been here? -I've been on this ship five years. Our superiors made up this motto: If the human body has no heart in it to pump the blood, then it dies, right? It's a simile. We're the heart of the ship. What if I take down the garlic? -The motor might come to a standstill. Faster! We have to get home to Ithaca! Those are the most important things in my life. The submarine... and my three women, with their initials here inside. Again, it's like it was with you, Giovanna. At the freight station, when we got you. When 1 look them in the eye, they begin to hope. And want something. Sometimes only toilet paper. But I can't give it to just one person. There'd be fighting. A roll only has 150 sheets. It is not malaria. He has pain around his ass. Around his ass, yes. -Where? Yes, it is not malaria. He appears to have low blood-pressure. Close. -It's done. There are almost 1,300 people on board. Shortly there will be 500 more, brought from another ship. So we'll have 1,800 people, the largest number that this ship has ever taken on board. Do you see signs of abuse? Were they beaten on the way? One woman has a swollen face, she was probably hit, too. They don't tell us. They are afraid to tell the truth. But there are signs that indicate it. Can you tell if they've been raped? We can't always be sure. If there are physical signs of violence, I might be able to determine it. Leave all family members together! -How many are there? Two or three more... -No, move off already! There are 45. 25, and all children. Years ago, I went on a ferry from Africa to Italy. For 36.50. Including a reserved seat. But there is no legal route to Europe for anyone here. Even if you're being persecuted. To get into paradise, you must first risk your fife. And each one has paid 1,500 dollars for it. Al! together, on this ship, almost 3 million. 3 million. For the smugglers. What I wasn't allowed to film: when a storm came in at night, mutiny threatened. Everyone wanted down below, but there, the boat was already full. The marines in their white caps formed a chain with their clubs. The captain tried to steer the ship around the storm. Are you okay? Are you sure? Don't worry. Give me your hand. Okay, not worry. You are safe. Okay? Okay, madam? Welcome on board. No, she hasn't got a number yet. Okay, please. What has she left behind? Children? What is she hoping for? What will become of her, with us? The mailman, luckily didn't notice there was money in the letter. We bought food with it. And glass for the broken window. Now it's lighter than it was with the newspaper up. The toothbrush didn't arrive, sadly. Italian words look funny. But Papa says my letters are upside down. Can you read it? I can still understand Swiss-German. They laugh at me in school when I say "Chuchichäschtli." They don't believe it means "kitchen cupboard!" Lots of kisses and warm regards, Giovanna. I'm sorry for my late letter, I was ill again. It's getting cold, and I'm wearing the warm clothes you gave me at yours. If you could see me! I'm taller than I was at yours! But thinner. Mama made the coat longer, but with black cloth, though. Through the crack of the open door I heard my parents talking at night. They were talking about you. "Our air would do her good." I bit the pillow with happiness. Here, Fm sending you our new address. Yes, I'll easily find you. We live under the same stars. My papa picked you up in Milan, at last. After much arguing at the border, and many stamps. He had to sign that he'd pay for everything, even if you get I“. And that you'd go back. To Italy. Our hug nearly paralyzed me. I'd never thought of you with breasts. But Marcelino, Fm not going to eat you! Ambaraba cici coco Three screech-owls on the cupboard... They made love... With the doctor's daughter... The doctor got ill... Ambaraba cici coco Slowly, slowly with the head-line. The red carpet is to disinfect the feet. And a trap. Where a refugee first sets foot, that's the country where they must stay. That country draws the short straw. The countries who set the rules are the ones with no warm beaches. Open your mouth. Okay, are you okay! 44, male. 45, male. 46, male. 47, male. 48, male. Wait! Can we talk English? Or French? You have the right... You may shower, then the doctor will come. You'll get new clothes. AR So... the police will come to identify you. With name, photo and fingerprints. Fingerprints are obligatory. In Italy and in Europe. There are 51. If you had to leave your country because you were in danger, because you were being persecuted, then you have the right to apply for asylum in Italy. Do you know what a refugee is? Do you know what refugee is? Is it clear? Do you have any questions? Welcome to Italy! 1 negotiated for months to be able to drive through this gate with my camera. What are the authorities afraid of? Hello my friend. ls everything okay? -Yes, yes. Everything okay. Okay. Is it too full? ls there no more room in the house? That's just how it works out. When it's very hot, they use the "outdoor air conditioning." They take the beds and sleep where they want to. Inside, there is air conditioning in every pan of the building, but they prefer to sleep outdoors. We don't forbid them anything, not even where and how they sleep. How long do they live here? The guests stay from 8 to 15 months in the camp. The commission decides. They check a number of facts that the people present to them. That's all. GO pasts Why don't the guests clean up here themselves? Because we're required by contract to do it. Their sleeping quarters as well as all the rooms. Our organization is responsible for it. Even for mowing the lawn. Because they have no permits? -Because they're not allowed to work. Especially not inside the camp. We can't use them as a workforce. Absolutely not! That would be illegal. The guests wait to go through the "door of hope." That's what we call it. Everything is okay for them in the camp, sport, psychological support, social facilities, doctors, playing football... And yet, their real hope is the commission. And that's the "door of hope." What kind of movie do you want to have? Give me the script, I start acting. I want to see the director. Do you have any script, maybe, so I can read? Who would you like to be? -Yeah, I like to be! After... All the people is talking. -I want it to start now. The inspiration is there right now. What the fuck do you want? English! I speak English! If you want to take me home, take me home. I am tired of this place. You are out of the camp. This director is not helping Nigerians, It's a bad man! I must tell the truth. Why is he a bad man? -Yes, yes! You are outside the camp. You can't talk like this. Excuse me... -No, no, no... You give negative. You send us off. They told us lawyer is free, but they don't give us lawyer. You understand? They give negative. At one week, they send you out of the camp. Why? Go see where I am living! They are not living conditions. They are not giving us our rights. He's breaking my balls! He's not one of our guests anymore. He's illegal. Okay»- Well... The guest who spoke to you isn't even from here. He got his asylum rejection. Even so, we supported him for a while. Unfortunately, we can't support people who... don't have the right. We're sorry about the incident. Because he was refused, he's very angry. But surely not with us. It's because of the commission. Where does he live now? -No idea. Those over there...? We'll take them some water. That's illegal work, right? -Yes. Thanks to them, Italian farming is blooming. They don't exist. To the State, these people don't exist. Excuse me... -Go ahead. That's fine. Very good. Okay, Abdullah, we'll talk tonight. No way you can go into the ghetto with a camera! Markus! Turn it off! Off! The problem is, the State doesn't offer them any alternative than the mafia. Whoever in the ghetto wants to find work, has to rely upon the mafia organization and illegal work. Otherwise you don't work. You can stay there, but without work. How can you transform a problem into an opportunity? First, by giving people documents, by making them visible, let them exist. Shall we? -Yes. Slowly, slowly, we go nearer... Do you want to go in? -Yes, yes... they're friends. What's your name? -Raffaele. Remember? I'm from the union. Why aren't you working? I'm ill. -What's wrong? A fever. -Go to the doctor this afternoon. Tell him you don't feel well. He's a good doctor. Go! Okay? It's important. -Yes. Do you know where the ER station is? It's free. And this smell? Nothing drains off, that's why it stinks like this. The garbage, burning plastic, dioxin. Doesn't the water drain away? We're from the CGIL union. Let me know if there's a problem. We help everyone. Come over here. What's happened? A field laborer... receives 30 euros a day. Half of that, he has to give to the boss. And then, he also has to send money to Africa. What about the women? The capos don't take women for work in the fields, they find them too weak. They're forced into prostitution. If you come here at night, you see Italian men lined up to visit the women. Markus... come on! I want to speak to you! -With me? I'm from the union... We've decided to strike. This is no life. It's not even surviving. Didn't you go to work? -Not this morning. I went to work yesterday, but not today, because the Italian capo didn't pay. Was it the Italian capo, not the black capo? Yes. -The Italian capo, yes? He didn't want to pay us. That's why we decided not to work until we get money. Come with me. When we arrived here, the capos hit us and beat us. Really? They don't like what we're doing here. But if we organize ourselves, the capos will end up in prison. I'm not afraid, personally. And I think, after what they've experienced until now, most of the others are not afraid either. If we protest and strike, lots of newspapers and TV stations will come. Then something will change, like it did in... Just the wind... We're the majority. It's like everything else, the market: The multinationals aren't the majority. We are, the consumers. Tomato production is founded upon enslaving the African. They harvest the tomatoes, they're underpaid and have no rights whatsoever. The agricultural businesses pocket EU subsidies. The tomatoes are sold in Northern Europe and Africa. The tins filled with the fruits of exploitation travel back to Africa. In Africa, they could grow and process their own tomatoes. Instead of that, they buy tins from the money that their relatives send them from Italy. A perfect system. Perfectly criminal. When they tell me about their crossing, it sounds like Dante: Hell, purgatory, paradise. For them, this part is purgatory. But their aim is paradise. Northern Europe. First Switzerland, then Germany. Please come with us. Outside. May I see your passport, please? Your passport? No? And you? Where are you going? Passport? Have you a passport with you? No? Eritrea? Sudan? Somalia? Somalia. I'll do it. Please follow. Okay? You see the Swiss flag? You are not in Italy. This is Switzerland. Understand? Madame? English or Tigrinya? Mister, you have to show me what you have in the pocket. You have to put there. Telephone, if you have money, document, you have to put there. Bar, and water. Everybody have to go back to Italy. -Italy? Italy! So, now we're in Italy. As you see, the mark is drawn in here. And here's the Swiss side. From here you have a good view over Chiasso railroad station. The border runs along there, ten meters next to that block. Italy starts there? -Exactly. The border runs there, up the mountain to the south. If you go a little further, you see hidden paths again and again. They used to be used much more. Today, it's crime tourists entering and leaving. Now it's trodden down. It goes steeply down, 15 to 20 meters. Uncle Paul was visiting us from South America. With his red-haired Adelina. And aunt Clara from Egypt. One uncle lived in America. Another in Japan. A great-grandmother came from England. And a great-great-grandmother from the Caribbean. My mother and all her siblings were born in India. Three of my cousins fled the Spanish Civil Wan. And my favorite aunt fled from Odessa. But I had to go back. Because of some new law. On my fourteenth birthday! I could hardly believe it. Children weren't allowed. Only foreign workers were allowed in Switzerland. No foreign children. You were teased: "Di"! Pig-nosed wop!" Remember our secret, Giovanna. Send me your rail ticket. I'll fix the hole in it so I can follow on, to you. Switzerland isn't by the sea. Sadly. According to the Dublin Regulation, there can't really be any refugees here. Unless one falls from the sky. But some managed, despite everything. They're waiting here for questioning and their asylum decision. Sometimes two years. Please help me. -With German? Oh, yes. "You help me," got it? "You helping... " -"Me." Yes. -"You, helping me." "You help... me." "Please can you help me?" In Syria, we're not allowed to speak Kurdish. -Really? Only in your region, or in all of Iraq and Syria, too? We're not allowed to speak Kurdish. Careful next to the cars. Don't break anything. With the shovel. I will take care. I will not scratch it. Always check. -What? Eyes! Look around. In an emergency, every Swiss citizen has the right to a place in a bunker. But since there is no emergency, refugees are living in the cellar. But not in every community. The richest village bought its way out of taking foreigners in. With over a quarter of a million francs. This way... We have 150 people here... I'll go into it in more detail, since you've never worked in the asylum system. Now, don't be shocked... This is the underground common room. This is the furthest underground room. We have space here for 32 people in total. It's cramped -Yes, cramped and restrictive. Sometimes it's really bad. If someone was in prison for a long time, or badly traumatized, then has to come down here... I can't conjure up places. I only have what I have. That has to be explained to newcomers. We have what we have, nothing more. CIVIL BUNKER Good morning and welcome in the name of the "State Secretary for Migration." You told me you are Palestinian. When did your forefathers arrive in Syria? Just the year. 1948... -1948, yes? "In 1948, my maternal grandparents, arrived in Syria." How long had you been toying with the idea of leaving the country? My first attempt was on the 22nd of July. But we were sent back by the regime. Because we are Palestinian we were sent back. Palestinians are forbidden from leaving Syria. Do you see, it says "travel ban." What page is that on? -18. The only opportunity was illegally, across the sea. Where does it say that? This entry on page 30 of the military booklet, says you were given a permit to travel. Before, you said Palestinians weren't allowed to leave the country. So what does this entry mean? When the wind of change blows, some people build walls, and others, windmills. I belong to those building windmills. I'm the police and military director of the Canton of Bern, and this year, its president. One of my most important responsibilities is migration, of course. In my own community is a village called Rütschelen, near Langenthal. There, in the municipal council chamber hangs a mural showing a scene from the first half of the 19th century. Back then, the community council decided that 50 citizens had to leave the community and migrate, to America for example. They were waved off at the community border and each of them was given a 50 note. That's the mural. The discrimination is so striking, if you say, "Those are refugees, and those are only economic refugees." They were economic refugees, from Rütschelen. They had no prospects, they were hungry. So they said to them: "Go, so that the rest of us can survive." Yes, that was a reality, even in Europe. And now the Europeans are wealthy, for various reasons. Maybe they're hardworking but maybe that's not the only reason. Now the emigrants are somewhere else emigrating to Europe. So what? These plants aren't well spaced out. I'll move these back so they've got more space. And we leave the leaves. -Okay. These leaves have to stay on. I broke this flower off. That's not good either. That's a pity. We'll repair it so we can keep the flower anyway. That's how you can help if there's been a mistake. After three months, asylum seekers are allowed to work. But they hardly find any. Because no-one's sure when they“ be deported. They earn 3 francs an hour for unskilled labor. Those allowed to stay earn 3,200. Now you have one-to-one care from two women. That's hard work! What color is that, Rahel? "Yellow." It's yellow. Here comes Mrs Meier. -Yes. Oh, how lovely! How are you? -Good, thanks. And you? I'm doing very well. But I don't feel like doing this. Do you want to do it alone or should Rahel help you? It'd be nice if she helped. Maybe together? -Did you understand? Ask her again. A bit of painting with the brush. With the brush? Rahel's asylum application was refused. She's not allowed to work here anymore. But they're working to develop robot caregivers, to lighten the workload. Without immigration, our population will begin to shrink and grow senile. When I'm old, I'd rather be pushed around the park by Rahel than a robot. We spent three nights at sea. Then the boat broke. A storm came up and we couldn't go on, nor back. We sent out a distress call. Then, the Libyans came. We'd sent the call for help to Italy. But the Italians couldn't help us, so the Libyans came. They pulled us out of the water. The captain and four or five people drowned. They died. And with the help of God, we survived. They pulled us out and then they took us to jail. We sat in jail for seven months in Libya. It's a terrible situation there, humiliating. The escape is of relatively little interest to us... I've heard all sons of bad stories. For example, from people from Eritrea who were in Libya for a long time, where they were imprisoned by some militia or other or were forced to pay ransoms, to do slave labor, to be sex slaves... Really horrible things. Even if these people experienced more terrible things... than what caused them to leave in the first place. Is there no judge for these crimes? Or who would be responsible? Who would be responsible? Good question. I don't know. I warn the others that the journey is terrible. Terrible things happen. I can't tell you everything. I'm ashamed. I can't tell my family about the things I hide from myself. But I tell them that it's horrible. Anyway, I was in jail for almost a year. I tell them that many terrible things happen. I personally can't remember ever having written a positive verdict for an African. I can't remember one case. Unless they came from Somalia, Eritrea. But Nigeria... that's the country of origin for many. Ghana... Guinea... No! Why is your mother writing, and not you? "Giovanna is very ill. She's lost 11 kilos and has a high fever. I called the priest. He gave her the holy oi! and the sacrament. Then the postman rang, with a parcel. Giovanna had won a doll in a contest from a soup company. She opened her eyes one last time. 'How lovely she is, Mama. When I get well, I'll take this dolly to Switzerland for Ursula. We never could give the family anything.' And she closed her eyes, and said no more.“ Marcelino, don't be sad. I had nothing that I could give you. I got there too late. You were dead already 28 years when I was finally able to migrate to you. Did you really fix the hole in my train ticket? Didn't they notice on the train? There was no form fill out for migration from north to south. I had to go to the immigration police every year. After three years, I could use the “artisti e ballerine“ counter, for artists and dancers. It was quicker than in the line with the Ethiopians and Libyans from former Italian colonies. And the policeman was more friendly. See Markus? You're still on the other side. I wanted to see if living somewhere else could change one's identity. Because the Italians couldn't pronounce my name, even after decades, everyone still calls me "the Swiss." So I am forced to be who I am. And still, you have a beautiful family and a beautiful wife. My Raffaella got along well with your mother. We even celebrated Christmas together. And my parents came from Switzerland every year. How old everyone has become! My father blamed himself right up into old age, for letting you go back, back then. Your mother looked after our children often. “Our children.“ What does “us“ mean? Who is us? BE RIGHT BACK Are you happy going home? He is happy- He wants make sure that you want to go back. Switzerland will finance your professional reintegration up to 3,000 francs. There are 3,000 francs available. For you as a Senegalese, that's 1.5 million CFA-francs. After my return I'll invest in cattle. I'll buy two cows. A big suitcase! You have to close it like that. Here you go. Okay? Thanks. It's getting cold. Those who don't go voluntarily are tied up and deported. Accompanied by three police officers and a member of the anti-torture commission. It costs the State 15,000 per person. But we're not allowed to see that. I don't like the cold. Me neither. All of that, you can eat. The cows don't need a herder. They've got it good. Did you see? Yes. One of the cows even has a blanket. Shouldn't it be here? Is it going to London? I can't find the end. You have two pieces of luggage? -Yes. Do you want to look around? -Yes... over there? This one is "Tete de Moine," monk's head. That's half of one... Maybe too expensive. -Yes, a little... 600 francs. There you go. -Thank you. "In the darkness, 1 look at the green fights from the fife supporting machines humming mechanical sounds, I can feel the breath of death drawing closer," one of the world's richest men, Steve Jobs, said on his deathbed. "Now I know... we should pursue other matters that are unrelated to wealth. Perhaps relationships... perhaps a dream from younger days. What I can bring is only the memories precipitated by love. That's the true riches...“ In the same month that Ba Yero came home and bought his cows, the EU reached a trade agreement with West Africa. Import customs on European milk were to be abolished. To get rid of our vast surplus of subsidized milk. Now our milk will be cheaper in Africa than Ba Yero´s milk. Why is his son {coking into the dry grass? Is he already dreaming of his journey into the land of milk and honey? Uranium, cobalt, gold. Diamonds, cocoa, coffee... Africa has all the important resources. My home country is the Ivory Coast, perhaps it has changed, but before, it was the largest producer of cocoa in the world. And until recently, there wasn't a single chocolate factory there. I wanted to go to university in Switzerland, but it wasn't possible. Now my plan is to study here in Italy. And as soon as I'm finished studying, I'll go back to Africa. COURAGE WILL NOT FAIL US IF WE DO THE RIGHT THING Still, everyone calls themselves "I". Because European countries resist the distribution of refugees, Italy now sends its marines into Libyan waters to send the refugees right back, instead of rescuing them. Aided by one of the Libyan civil war parties, and by smugglers who have changed sides. The refugees are put into the notorious Libyan prisons without ever being able to apply for asylum. The bounty per person is paid by Italy and the EU. Were they all thrown out of our paradise, too? All of the dead? Is there barbed-wire on heaven's gate? And questioning? Or is one finally freed from "I"? For Giovanna, Akhet, Rahel and all the others.
