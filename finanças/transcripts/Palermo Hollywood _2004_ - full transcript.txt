Be cool now, because he's... - How are you, Dante? - What's up, Mario? - How are you? - What's up, man? - Good? - Do you want some maté? - Yeah, sure, I want some maté. - What are you guys up to? Another riot? What's this one about? - The dollar rate or what? - Everyday there's a new problem. It's hard to earn a living out there nowadays. - Tough, isn't it? - Huh? - It's tough, right? - Yeah. But you guys have a blast. Why? No, we don't. - It affects me too, you know? - You came back early today. - Ximena? - She's not here. - Don't tell me she's at her mother's. - Yeah, she is. Damn it! - Beba, can I come in? - No, it's late. Didn't you notice? - Beba, please. Let me in. - No! - Ximena! - Pablo, calm down! Pablo, can you calm down, please? What's going on? Get out, Pablo, I don't want to talk to you now! - What did I do now? - Nothing! You do nothing! Can't you see that's the problem? You don't give a shit about Valentina and me! We're your family! - You only care about yourself! - Baby, that's not true. Don't call me "baby"! And it is true! You're selfish as fuck. I can't plan a future with you. - Ximena, let's go home and talk. - Don't listen to him. - Ximena, please. - What? Get off me! Valen! Valen, sweetie! I'm not going back to your house. Well, it's your dad's. We're not married. I'll stay here. - Stop it. Come here. - But I'm right. It's not your house. - Not in front of the baby, come here. - Well... Who am I? What's my name? The Ru... - The Russian! - Very good! Give me a kiss. Three! Again. Here! There it is! Here. Talk to you tomorrow? I'll tell you the truth, my love I cheat on you with my dick But not with my heart I love you! Cumbia with Damas Gratis Baby, we'll make out today I got high again today I can't stop... Thanks, Judy. - Judy, my drugs, please! - Good morning, right? No. I can imagine, it must be a nightmare for you waking up at this time. Don't speak to your sister like that! - Let him, Daddy. - "Let him" what, you idiot? See what you've done? Do you want to upset him or what? - At least he doesn't support me. - Are you kids fighting already? If he knew where you get your money from... - From stealing, where else? - Mario, don't ever say that! How do you think thieves look like? - Mario! - What? Please! Be like him, Mom, just read the newspaper. - You know nothing about me. - Well, you know nothing about me either. Ernesto, please. Now's not the time. No one gave me anything, you brat. I worked to get to where I am. And where are you? Don't talk like that to your father. He doesn't deserve it. After everything he's done for you. Do you realize? You've raised a monster. Mario, do you need money? - What's my name? - The Russian. - Where does that one go? - Is that what you're wearing, Pablo? And inside? Where are you going to? "Angley"? - To work! - Yes. Why don't you wear this? Bye. Give me a kiss. - Thank you! - You're crazy about her! - Where are you guys off to? - To the club. - Which one? - The club. And you? I don't know, I'll check what the girls are up to. Eugenia wants to go see Damas Gratis, but I really don't want to. You should come with us. - What are you up to? - What do you mean? Don't play dumb with me. I saw you with some girl the other day. When, Juli? You're the only one. - Bullshit! - I'm saving myself for marriage. - What? You want to marry me? - Of course. Really? How adorable! Yeah, right! If your buddy leaves, you do too. - Where? - To Italy, with Ximena's uncle. Come on, you know. You guys are like brothers. You know more about each other than about yourselves. For sure! - Russian, are you ready? - Let's go. - Bye, Juli. - Bye. And one for me? For the Russian? Come on! Guys, do you have any acid? Do you have any acid? - Fuck off! - Okay, man. Russian! Thanks, Russian! I'll give it back to you tomorrow. Come on! - How are you? - Fine, and you? Me? Very good. Great. That's great. - Do you have any...? - Yeah. "This is happening right now, and it will never happen again." Do you think this was meant for us? - You could see it that way... - How? Tell me. My theory is that it was wonderful and we should enjoy it while it lasts because it won't happen again. And another theory is that that wonderful moment was the result of something that was always there, but was never expressed. So... we should enjoy it now because this moment is unique, and will be remembered forever. - I like that theory. - I like it too. Wait until I tell the girls... Wait, I was kidding! Where were you? Mario, it's your life you're throwing away. Turn that thing off. - Turn it off, I'm talking to you. - What did I do now? I don't know. You tell me. Since when do you care about my life? You're my son. I'll always care about you. - When will you stop, Mario? - When will I stop what? - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about your life, Mario. When will you stop throwing it away? Who do you hang out with? Do you remember what your grandfather used to say? "If you make your bed right..." "You'll sleep well," yeah! Always with sayings and proverbs! Can't you talk to me like a father? "Hey Mario, how are you doing? Did you go out? Did you get laid? Great! Did she have nice tits?" You think I'd be a better father if I asked you if you got laid? Sorry, I don't care about that. What I care about is your future. Are you working on something solid that will make you proud and respectable? Maybe. But you wouldn't think so. It has nothing to do with being Jewish, the Belgrano neighborhood or having money. What's the problem if I want those things for you? That's the problem! Can't you see? You don't want to see it. You know what? It's just like TV, look. You can ignore it if you want, but the world keeps turning. Don't get her pregnant. - Hi, Vale! - Hi, Pabli! - You've been missing in action! - I've been studying a lot. Careful there! Did you scratch it? For sure! Italy! Yeah, what about it? Come on, asshole! Aren't you going to tell me about it? Ximena has an uncle in Florence who can get me a job there. First, we'd go for three months. If things work out, we'll come back and do all the paperwork. And you weren't going to tell me about it? It wasn't the right time, Russian. I knew you'd be pissed. Of course I'm pissed, man! We're friends, aren't we? Yeah, you're like a brother to me, but I can't go on like this. I have to get my act together. This is Ximena's idea. She convinced you. Look, man, I don't want to steal anymore. I feel worse every time we do it. And Ximena gets more and more upset. She doesn't get over it easily anymore. Sometimes, she doesn't come home for days. I don't want to lose her, man. Try to understand. Also, I need about seven grand for the paperwork and the plane tickets. Do I look like I have seven grand? It would take me a year to save up. It's just a dream. Fine, man, you know I'd be the first one to help you out. But I'd lose a friend. However, if that's your decision, I respect it. Family comes first. Thanks, Russian. I love you, buddy. - The apprentice beats the master. - I let you win, fool! - I won't beat you anymore. - Me? - There's the Turk. - Do you have the money? Do I have to think of everything? Wow! Good work, boys! - Sit down. - No, thanks. Pablo, sit down! Forgive him, Stevie, he was with Roberto last night and today he can't sit down. Learn from the Russian. Don't be ungrateful. - Do you want a line? - Can I? That and much more, sweetie. Damn! Do you want the whole package? Pussy and blow? - Excuse me, Esteban, the thing is... - You're not excused. You're so ungrateful. Is money all you care about, then? Here. Come on, man. Just do a bump! You know, Fag... I mean, Stevie. Pills are for rookies. We can do better than that. Why are you looking at me like that, man? You of all people. Okay, guys, if you don't want to fuck, get out. I have things to do. Russian, here's your money. Later, kid. Hi, sweetie. - So? Did you like it? - You were great! - Really, don't fuck with me. - I'm serious! I wanted to get in there and make love to you with that hat on. - You're such an idiot. - I mean it. Honey, I have some good news. I talked to my uncle. He asked me if we were coming or not. I told him we were saving up money for the plane tickets, that we didn't want to show up broke, and we were still a bit short, and guess what? He said he'd lend us the money for the tickets, and that he'll get us jobs once we get there! That's great. - What? Aren't you happy? - Yeah, it's great. Pablo, if you thought it was great, you wouldn't be saying it like that. Damn, why is everything a problem with you? How am I supposed to react? What am I supposed to say? "Bye! I'll just pack my things, and that's it, I'm off to Italy!" I'll say goodbye to my family, to my dad, to my sister. "Bye, everyone!" Fine, Pablo, never mind. We always end up doing what you want. That's the way it is. You don't want to make plans with me anymore. You want to keep partying, fucking other girls, and it's fine. - Ximena, you're crazy. - No. If I'm right, just tell me. I'll understand. But I can't go on like this, Pablo. Pablo, look at me. If you want to be with me, you have to actually be with me. I want to. Yes, I want to be with you. I want to, yes. NO TO THE IMF - Hello? - Juli, it's me, Mario. Hey, what's up? Pablo's not here, he went to see Xime dance. - Do you want to wait for him? - Can I come in? Juli, I actually came to talk to you. See? I think this whole thing is going to be a mess, you know... I mean us, being together. Pablo's going to freak out. I know him. To him, you're untouchable. To me, you're untouchable! If he finds out any of the guys tries to make a move on you, he'd go nuts! And besides, it would never work, we're too different. I mean, I'm much older, and I'm on a different vibe. Pablo's like a brother to me, and you too, you are like my sister, you know? A friend's sister, you're like a step-sister to me. And I don't want to fuck that up! Because you and I get along so well. This would mess things up, for sure. Pass that joint! Anyway, I was so fucked up yesterday, I didn't know what I was doing. I mean, it's not like I didn't know. I just didn't think of the consequences. You know? I'd marry you, Juli. Besides, you know how I am, I'm not a one-woman man, and you deserve much more. But really, I'm not ready for marriage, you know? And it's not you, it's me. It's this damn country we live in, and this situation... I'm a mess. I need you to understand me. So, well, I don't know. It's extremely important that we... You know? We... You need to share my point of view, because we need to straighten this out. Mario, I completely agree. - What? - I completely agree with you. So, should I let you know when I want to get married? Or what do you want to do? Julieta, what are you doing? This. What are you looking at? You. - Don't look at me. - Why? - Because I'm embarrassed. - Why? I'm not used to you seeing me naked. - What time is it? - Two o'clock. Are you afraid your buddy will show up? No, don't say that, girl. Don't worry, every time Beba's watching the baby they don't come back until 6 a.m. Do you have any album by Roberto? MUCHACHO ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK Of course. Destiny and time Have struck me down so many times But I keep moving on And never let it get me down It's not worth it to cry Or beg to make it stop You have to think That good things will come by I once had all the friends That came with money I once had And in bohemian nights We all would drink until we drowned But that's in the past Time's taken it away And as you can see I stand here anyway In the end, life goes on anyway In the end, life goes on anyway! In the end, life goes on anyway In the end, life goes on anyway! Wine, women, parties, love Are some of many pleasures That make up for all the pain We must smile and forgive Because in the end, why suffer? I made a bet with life That I would never cry again And cheated more than once So I could win from time to time I don't know how to lose Because I was born to win And as you can see I stand here and laugh In the end, life goes on anyway In the end, life goes on anyway! In the end, life goes on anyway In the end, life goes on anyway! If once sorrow broke my heart I just carried on with all the pain I didn't pay attention to it I joined forces with time And all the pain then went away Because pain was always my friend Those things I dream about I doubt they ever will come true In my journey in life Many of my dreams have long been overdue But yes, I gained as much As much as I did live And today I see I didn't lose a thing In the end, life goes on anyway In the end, life goes on anyway! In the end, life goes on anyway - In the end, life goes on anyway! - Yes, it does! - In the end, life goes on anyway - Sing with me, sing it loud In the end, life goes on anyway! In the end, life goes on anyway... What's the matter? Did I scare you? Fuck you, Wall! - I shat myself. - What are you doing here? Having an ice cream, man, what does it look like? Are you alone? We're off to Bustamante. Do you want to come? - The place with the Cuban girls? - Yes, they've got great whores there! - Come on! Let's go! - No, I'm done for the day. I was with Pablo at the Fag's before, and I'm still fucked up. The Russian, turning down pussy? Who are you? He must've been eating pussy all night! - Sure, man. - Yeah, eat you ice cream. For your cramps. Bye. I just ran into Enrique and the Wall. Did they see us? I don't think so. - What's up, faggot? - Nothing. Man, I told you about the Fag. - Hey, it's money. It'll be quick. - What kind of job is it? An express kidnapping. Listen carefully. If everything goes well, there's good money for everyone. The Turk is going with you. And listen. You'll do as he says. Understood? - Put it on. - Turn around. - Turn around, motherfucker! - Wait! What do you want? Come on, bitch, or I'll kill you! Turn around! Wait, you don't need to do this! Listen! I have my wallet in my coat pocket, grab it! Shut the fuck up, man. Don't make me go crazy! EZEIZA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT Turn left here. - We'll end up in the middle of nowhere. - Exactly. LA PLATA - BUENOS AIRES HIGHWAY ATTENTION END OF HIGHWAY BUENOS AIRES VIA HIGHWAY MUNICIPALITY OF QUILMES UNDER SECRETARY FOR PUBLIC SERVICES WELCOME TO QUILMES BEACH Get him out. Stop, motherfucker! Where the fuck are we? Stop, man! Stop! Stop! Come here! Come here, you son of a bitch! Sorry about this. I didn't know we were coming all the way here. But don't worry about it. We'll be out of here in no time. Ximena will be mad as hell if I don't pick her up on time. I have to take the baby to the doctor. Let's hope they pay us soon. Do you know how much it is? 878 STREET The call's been made. Now we just have to wait. You two watch the car, I'll stay with Bonaventura. With whom? Who's the guy? I don't know. I thought he was a nobody. Stop, motherfucker! Come here, you son of a bitch! Motherfucker! Son of a bitch! What's going on, man? Why are they taking so long to bring the money? They're cheap bastards, man. We should be on our way back already. Here he comes the Turk. There's not much time left. We've made our demand. If the money doesn't turn up... Man, this shit stinks. It's going to be fine. Stop worrying. I don't get it. This is not an express kidnapping. It's taking forever! Besides, that Turk looks shady as hell, I don't trust him. I told you, man. I told you not to do business with the Fag! This is the last time I do a job for that son of a bitch! If he doesn't come out now, I'm getting the hell out of here! Don't be an idiot, man. Take a step out in this area and you're dead! Are you nuts? I don't give a shit! What the fuck happened here? Help me lift him up. No, stop, man! Stop, you son of a bitch! Please! Come on, walk! Walk! Stop, please! Here. Put him down. Wait, what are you saying? Are you crazy? Do as I say, kid. No way! You're nuts! Listen, you little shit! They won't pay! And this is what happens when people don't pay! Come on! You son of a bitch! Do it now. I'm out of here! This is not what we agreed! Pablo? Hold on, Turk. Take it easy! - Shoot him! - No, man, wait! I'll count to three. One... Hold on, man, please... Two... Wait, man! My two heroes! Get over here, give me a hug. What's wrong? Why the long faces? You're going to make me cry, guys. You're going to make me cry. You did a great job. And now you'll get the reward you deserve. But most importantly... now we're like family. You do my dirty laundry and I'll do yours, get it? Esteban, the guy is dead. It was your fault, honey. It was really unfortunate. It's all in a day's work, as they say. - That wasn't part of the deal! - It's okay to be a little nervous, allow yourself to feel like that, but just for a while. Otherwise, you can't enjoy the rewards of hard work. Here, five thousand. Hey, man, are you okay? - Are you okay, dude? - I told you, man. How many times did I tell you that? Do you have any idea what we've just done? The Fag's got us in his pocket. You're fucked, Mario. There's no going back now. You're like me now. - What are you talking about? - Isn't that what you want to be? Aren't you always trying to prove how much of an underdog you are? Well, you made it. There's no going back now! Calm down, why are you mad at me? It's not my fault. I had no idea it was going to end up like this. What happened is really serious! The worst that could've happened! But try to look ahead, I... I did this for you. Did you know about this? Russian, did you know about this? Stop the car! No, I didn't! How was I supposed to know he was going to die? I just wanted us to get five grand each! When did he tell you all that? Yesterday. Before we left, the Fag told me, "Come back, I have something for you." When I got in, everyone was so fucked up. He asked me if I wanted to earn ten grand in two hours. "Of course," I said. You would've done the same! You are such an idiot! You don't know anything! Why do you even steal? Tell me. For spite? To get back at your dad? Who do you think you are? The pope? You're no saint. Give back all the money you've stolen, then! Is this all my fault now? You're the one who shot him! - To save your life, motherfucker! - I didn't ask you for any favors! Are you talking to me like that? To me? After everything I've done for you? After treating you like a brother? You selfish bastard! You're going to end up all alone! Go home, Pablo. We'll talk tomorrow. No! I'm looking for an ideal girl Who likes to smoke I'm looking for an ideal girl You are like a drug You make me fall for you You make me go crazy You are my girl, my illegal girl NEWSPAPERS FRESH ORANGE JUICE I was coming from presenting a commercial at a building, because I'm a filmmaker, and a car drove up, a 504. I clearly remember it was champagne color. There was a guy in front of me, he was in his car. Four or five men got out of that car, the one I told you about before, and they started hitting this guy. Badly. One of them pulled out a gun and I froze, you know? I didn't know what to do. They knocked him out or something, put him in the car, and then... the car took off speeding. At that moment, I saw a planner and a set of keys, which I took to the police, of course, and I also gave my statement. And I think I'd seen one of them before, I can't remember where. But I'll do everything that I can to clear up this case and help in any way I can. What we just saw is a report that can help shed light to the whereabouts of Mr. Bonaventura, who has been missing for over a week now. Is this another kidnapping? This is his wife, Mrs. María Esther, who's been living a real nightmare since last week. And this is Congressman Ernesto Segal, candidate for Senator, who, as a public official, should be able to provide answers to what is happening with this crime wave. We'll be right back. Give us our money back! Asshole! Son of a bitch! Thief! - Miss, who are you looking for? - I'm looking for Mario. Mario is not here. - Will he be back soon? - I don't know, he didn't tell me. I'm on my way. Okay. - Judy. - Yes. I'm going to the supermarket to buy a few things. Do we need anything? - No, we're fine, ma'am. Thanks. - Okay, good. Hi. You must be Beatriz, right? - Yes. - I'm Julieta, Pablo's sister. - Yes, sure. How are you, dear? - Fine. No, we don't need anything, we're good. Okay, when Mario comes out of the bathroom, serve him lunch and tidy up his room because it's a mess. Yes, ma'am. As soon as Mario comes back, I'll serve him lunch. - Okay. It was a pleasure. - Likewise. - Will you tell him I came by? - Sure. Xime, hi, can I talk to Pablo, please? - He's not here, Mario. - Ximena, please. I'll tell him you called. Ximena, can you get him? I know he's there! Tell him we... I'll tell him, Mario. I have to go, I'm with the baby. - Ximena, please, tell him I'm at home! - Sure. Ximena, listen to... Pablo. Are you going to talk to me? What happened with the Russian? Why won't you talk to him? Is that why you're upset? What did he do to you? Pablo! He's not doing well, you know? He was in jail for two years. Good thing it was for stealing. You know what they do to rapists, don't you? Is that true? Pedophiles get the worst treatment. They become slaves. It's not like you see in films, where you belong to a group. Inside, you're all alone! It's every man for himself. If you're new, you have to fight everyone. One by one, until you can't go on. The guard puts you in a cell, and they come in and beat the shit out of you, one by one... until you can't get up. The next day, the same thing happens. Until you earn everyone's respect. And you have to "asept" that, there's no alternative. - You have to what? - "Asept" it. You must "asept" it. That's the way it is. Yeah. "Accept," you moron! Not "asept," "accept." See? Do you want to end up like that? Are you talking to me? Pass that joint, man. Well, guys, I'm calling it a night. - Bye. - Bye. Do you want me to look after your car? Hey, Mario. What's up with Pablo? We haven't seen him in a week. - I don't know. - What happened? Did you guys break up? - Do you want me to drop you off? - Great, man. Mario, can you drop me off too? Why are we knocking on this door? Well, because TV3 News investigated and found out that this is Mario Segal's home. Who is Mario Segal? Some people have testified seeing him at the scene of the crime. And we will stay here until he talks to us. Let's keep trying. Mario David Segal? What detergent do you use?

There are new suspects that will be under investigation. We'll stay here and try to get new witnesses. Pablo, I can't take it anymore! I can't keep seeing you like this. I'm tired of being the loser that deals with your moodiness here! Ximena, please, I can't. What? You can't what, Pablo? What is it? Please tell me. What happened to you? Are you seeing someone else? Is that it? Do you want to break up? Don't be stupid. What is it, then? You ignore me, it's as if I didn't exist. What changed last week? I don't get it! You came to see me dance, we had a great time, we made plans together. And now you're backing out, shutting yourself away. Why did you change your mind, Pablo? I don't get it! You're in a different zone. You didn't even pick up Valen to go to the doctor's. Pablo! Is this about Italy? Grow some balls, dude, talk to me! If you want to leave me, if you want to break up, just say it! Ximena, leave me alone. Look, Juli, it's Mario. - Get out of the car, asshole! - Julieta, please calm down! "Calm down"? I've been trying to reach you for a week! What the fuck? Why do you do this to me? You never called! You think I didn't know you were home the other day? - Do you think I'm an idiot? - Julieta, I don't have time for this now! Please, tell me where Pablo is. Who told you to avoid me? Just call me and end it so I can forget about you! Who do you think you are, man? Can you keep it down? Sorry, but I have bigger problems than you being in love with me. In love with you? In your dreams. I hate you! I hate you with all my heart. You know what? Do whatever you want, fuck whoever you want, just stay away from me! Hello? Finally! We haven't seen you in ages. Juli, what's wrong? Are you okay? I'm fine, Pablo. Go away. - Hello. - Pablo! Don't hang up! We have to talk. It's urgent. - Where are you? - At the park. Finally! You have no idea what happened. "What happened"? You fucked my sister, that's what happened. Yeah, I heard! You piece of shit! You have no respect! I gave my life for you! You have no values, just like your father! You're corrupt, just like him! Man, just listen to me for a second, it's important! Why don't you tell us the truth? Why don't you tell everybody who you really are? Fuck you, you motherfucker! Tell them the truth, come on! Tell them who you really are! Tell them you're Congressman Segal's son! You're no kid from the street! You're a self-hating Jew who steals so you can have a few friends! Stop! Can you listen to me? Get out of here, Russian! - You have to hear what happened! - Get out! Criminologists! Attention, criminologists... Hold on! Criminologists! Attention, criminologists... Take it easy, kid, turn around. What's going on, sir? - Turn around. - But why? What the hell is going on? I didn't do anything. - Come on, turn around. - What's the matter? Turn around, damn it! Ready? Get in. Officer, like I said, it was a misunderstanding amongst friends, that's all. I'm a detective. You're not here because you fought with your stupid boyfriend. Do you know this man? No idea. How about now? No. And now? José Luis Bonaventura, businessman and politician. Married, two daughters. Lives on Libertador Avenue. He likes parties and hookers. How about this guy? Do you know him? Stevie, the Fag. Homosexual, drug lord, pedophile. What are you doing here, Stevie? I heard you got in a fight with Pablo and wanted to check on you. You know you boys are like sons to me. And I always worry about my children. - Don't worry, everything's fine. - It doesn't look like that. - Look at your face. - It's nothing. Get in the car. - I have to go home. - I told you to get in the car! Do you know what they say around the neighborhood, kid? That the Fag owed a lot of money to Bonaventura, and since he didn't want to pay, he had him killed. Do you know what else they say? That you and your friend hang out a lot with the Fag and do some jobs for him. You know how the story goes, right? Do you know who you're dealing with? Did you know the Fag is wanted by the Uruguayan police for trafficking and murder? Who are you protecting? Your friend, you think he'll keep quiet? What do you think will happen when both of you get caught? Your friend's daddy is going to help him out. But a street kid from Palermo will end his days in jail. You have two choices here. Long and complicated, or short and easy. Didn't I tell you that? I said it multiple times. - It has nothing to do with it! - No? You can't trust him. See what he did to Julieta? I saw them. What does that have to do with his dad being a politician? Shut up, kids, the adults are talking. Are you going to tell me who did this to you? Was it Pablo? No, it happened in a soccer match. I thought it was him because he found out about you and Julieta. No, not at all. You know everything, don't you? You know you can count on me. You get special treatment from me, Russian. - Stop it, Stevie, I'm late. - Wait! Okay. The short option is this: you sign this confession, stating that you participated in the murder of Bonaventura, but, mind you, following Esteban Testaferro's orders. You do some time, try to survive, and soon enough you're a free man. You'll have your whole life ahead of you. Here. If you want more, swing by the club. Mario... you know I love you, right? If you are in trouble, you can count on me. You are making things hard, kid. This is the second option. Today's the autopsy. And tomorrow I'll have the dogs chewing your balls off. Say goodbye to your family and to your life. Get it? So, what the fuck is it going to be? I'm deeply sorry about the death of this man. But... I have no idea what you're talking about. If you want to lock me up, go ahead. If not, then let me go, I have many things to do. You walk out that door and the offer's gone. Understood? It's your call. Arrested because of an accident. Your problem is that you couldn't fuck her yourself! Do whatever you want! But if he shows up in my neighborhood, I'll kill him. You're a fucking Nazi! I'm out of here! Son of a bitch. Get the fuck out. You have to make a decision now, kid. You walk out that door, you lose the offer. Excuse me... am I under arrest? It wouldn't do any good getting the police involved in this. What's more... I think Ernesto would disapprove of your actions. What? - Where do you get... - Not Valeria, or Betty or Julieta! Get it? Sealed lips, are we clear? Here, kid. Now, don't be shy. Now go home and take care. Ximena! Ximena! Where is she? Beba, I'm begging you. You know I love her more than anything! I know we fight a lot, but that doesn't mean I don't love her. You, more than anyone, should know I'd give my life for her! It's my family! My woman, my daughter! I know you love her in your own way, I'm sure of that! But she packed and left. She's going to Italy. And she didn't leave an address, so that you couldn't find her. Okay? - Please tell me it's not true, Beba. - Do you want to know something? Although I think you're a fucking bum and a lousy father, I do believe you love her. And I'm scared of her going to another country alone with the baby. Please, go get her. Find her, please. Okay? I need to get high. Everything's going to be okay. No, just a bit more. Okay. Just a bit more and everything's going to be okay. I... It's not my fault. I'm fine. Nothing will happen to me. I'm fine. I... It wasn't my fault. Julieta, it's your fault that... One more. One, two, three. Done. I'm fine now. Just one more. I'm fine. Everything's going to be fine. Everything will be okay. I'm fine. It wasn't my fault. Everything will be okay because... Everything... What are you doing? Are you crazy? - Get out of here before I kill you! - Stop! Walk! Out! I told you to leave! Come on! Ximena! Xime, are you there? Ximena, I got scared. But I made up my mind. You are my girl. That's it. Let's get the fuck out of here. - Juli, are you okay? - What happened with Mario? What happened? Hell Anguish Reset Reset I fade into shadows I fall into my own trap I fight against this anguish I change my role in the middle of the game Countdown Skin and bones activate I turn the key, I change time Hell Anguish Reset Reset I deactivate my eyelids I activate my dream I see myself upside down in the mirror I dream of science fiction I sweat, I get irritated I find danger... You never know with women. You'd think they're easy, but they're smarter than us. No, man, but this isn't just any girl. This is a girl you'd marry forever, you know? Can you imagine how our kids would look like, man? They'd be beautiful, just like her! That's it, man. She's smart, she's sweet. And I blew it! Because I'm an idiot! Just tell her you love her and she'll forgive you. No, this time I really fucked it up, man. But I swear I'd do anything to have her with me now, man. She's an angel. You know? She was crazy about me and I fucked it up, as always. My friends, my family, my neighborhood. I'm all alone. Are you going to try it or not? You asked me how I was doing, so... I don't need to know about your life! I'm not a therapist. Try it, pay me and get out! Don't be a drag! Come on, do it and get out! Julieta? Hey, sissy. Get out of here, Russian, before there's trouble. Haven't you been telling everyone you'll kick my ass, faggot? So? Here I am! Are you backing off now? Faggot! - Cut it out, man! - Come on! It's their problem. Come on, kid. Someone is here for you. How are you, Mario? Mario, I... I've always tried to guide you in the best way that I could. But... no, it's not that, it's that... I'm not blaming you for anything. I can imagine how much you've suffered because of my absence... and my ways. But there's something you need to understand, Mario. I'm on your side. I will never be against you. Mario, I... At times, I feel like I have lots of strength left, and at others, I feel like I've reached my limit. And maybe we don't have much time left together, Mario. Your achievements are also mine. I always quote your grandfather. Well, he used to say... that we must use all our capacity to understand those who are lost or confused. And I didn't see it. I didn't see you were confused. That you were lost in the storm. Or maybe you felt like you didn't belong, like you didn't have a family. But that's not true, Mario. You belong to this family. You have me. I'm not the best father, but you also have your sister and your mother. They're also your family and you can turn to them when you're in need. Mario... family... comes first. And I, Mario... Mario, I love you very much. You have to understand that. Mario! You know what, Mario? I believe in you more than you believe in yourself. Mario. Mario... Mario... Mario. If you need me, call me. Just say, "Hey, Dad, I need to talk to you." Come on, Mario. Come on. Dad. You don't know who I am. Son, you have to sign. Can I at least know what I'm signing? You are signing a statement saying that you were taken against your will and forced to witness the murder of Bonaventura. - What about Pablo? - Your friend will be charged with murder, stating that he was under the orders of Esteban Testaferro. But he was forced to do it, he shot him because he didn't have a choice. - I want that to be clear. - Mario, what the police want is Testaferro on a silver platter. Your friend will just be an accomplice. He'll have a better chance of parole in a few months. But he wasn't an accomplice. He was forced! He did it to save my life! If that's the case, now you're saving his. Pablo's prints were all over the gun. If you don't sign this, he'll be going away for life. Pablo will hate me. How awful... What do you want, Mario? I need to talk to you, Juli. I know what happened. I understand your reaction now. But it made me realize that what we had was like a dream. I'm over it now. We can be friends. I thought I was in love with you. And I'm an idiot, so I thought you'd fall in love with me. - I am in love with you. - What? Juli, I've never been in so much trouble before. I've never been so confused. But things are clearing up now. Now's not the time, Mario. We can talk later... Juli, please, just hear me out. I want to apologize for what I did, I didn't mean to hurt you. I love you very much. Russian, I forgive you, you don't have to say all this. Please, don't call me "Russian." I know it's too late, I know I messed up, but give me a chance. I can't think of you as a friend. You're much more than that. You're unique. It hurts not being able to see you. With you, I feel like I belong somewhere. I can't. Can't what? I can't imagine being without you. Wants to give you a kiss. Give her a kiss. And one for me? A kiss? With a big hug... Who is this? What about the lion? Hello? Who? - Just a minute, please. - the nose. Pablo. The cops are outside. They're asking about you. What do I tell them? Xime, listen carefully. This is bad. I need to run before they come in. And we have to leave now! Take everything you need. - I'm going to get some money. - What is it? - Xime! - Where are you going? Don't go now, Pablo. Ximena, go to Enrique's. I'll call you and tell you where to meet me. Wait for Ximena here. Keep this safe. Take her and Valen to Retiro station and buy two tickets to anywhere. Don't leave until I get there. - I'm taking the motorcycle. - Okay. Careful with the Russian. Where's Daddy? No! THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN You make me fall for you You make me go crazy You are my girl, my illegal girl You are like a drug You make me fall for you You make me go crazy You are my girl, my illegal girl Cumbia! With Damas Gratis! Feel it, baby!
