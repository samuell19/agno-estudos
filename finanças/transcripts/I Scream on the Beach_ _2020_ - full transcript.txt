He, err, still wants a date with you. How is that any different from any other night? Shut up, Claudine. Dave, go on. Hi, Emily. Hi. Fuck me, the chemistry between you two is unbearable. Shut up. Are you going to the pub tonight? I work there. Haha, oh, mate! You arseholes! We still on for later though, yeah, babe? Cunts, I was getting somewhere as well. Oh yeah, it was like something from fucking Shakespeare Haha. Oink, oink. Hi, Paula. You're both late, you wouldn't pull this shit if daddy was here. Fucking hell, Emily. What are you wearing? It's not Halloween yet! Sorry! Anyway, I need you to go and change some barrels. What, and you can't do it? I'm just holding the fort while daddy's in the Canary Islands. Then it's back to L.A. for me. Oh yeah, your movie career. Emily that creepy guy's back again. Can you two stop gossiping and get out here? Fucking lazy cow. Alright, Keith, you old tosser. Ay up, there's no fish today, lads. Oh. Well, I guess we better to go t'pub early then, aye? I wish you guys hadn't ruined things for me and Emily earlier. Oh, boo hoo, you soppy shit. Look, this is your second chance to have another shot with her. - Yeah man, it was only a joke, Dave! - Yeah, Dave! Hey Emily, I just want to apologize what happened with the guys earlier. Hi, Dave. Hi. I was kind of talking to Emily. I've got this wicked film for us all to watch Halloween night It's gonna freak you all out. It's actually banned over here, fucking Mary Whitehouse, right? I had to get dodgy Dan to import a copy from South America Where life is cheap. What's it called? "House Painter", or something stupid like that? It's called "The Decorator", actually... And it's the scariest movie ever made. Any other options? Yeah, I've got... "Run Bastard Run", "Frat Party Blender Massacre", Um, "Sorority Babes and the Vampire", "Invasion of the Alien Spiders" "Kill, Kill, Faster, Faster" and "Campfire Girls". I've got tons. Can't wait. Oh, that creep's been in all day again. I swear he never takes his eyes off of Emily. Bants, can you get rid of him? Guys, don't don't worry about it, it's fine. No, Bants, if anyone is going to defend Emily, it's going to be me. Why? Hi, I've been talking to my friends... You've been making the barmaids feel uncomfortable so... We wondered if you could leave please. All right, sunshine, you've had enough, now get the fuck out of here. Yeah. Don't worry, girls, that creep won't bother you anymore, not with me around. Last orders! I knew this day would come. 'Night, dad. Emily. You're listening to Mellow Coast radio I'm your host, Pat Dixon. Now for some soothing Saturday morning tunes. What the fuck's up with you? Nothing, don't worry about it. Just tell me. I need to leave in 5 minutes. I had a dream last night. About dad. Your dad was a piece of shit, liar. Mum! Don't give me that, Emily, he tried to leave his wife Sold you a fantasy about running away, then dumped you on the beach. He didn't leave, he was murdered. I saw him get killed. Not this. It's a story you made up The police checked, your dad's car was never found, there was no blood No evidence to suggest either of you were ever there. No such thing has ever happened or would ever happen in Mellow Coast. Breaking news: Local fisherman Keith has been found murdered on Mellow Coast beach. Police are appealing to anyone who may have seen him yesterday to come forward. I'm off on holiday. Bye. Did you hear about that murder on the radio? I reckon it's that old man the guys work with. Yeah, I did. What's wrong, Emily? Did you know him? No, it's not that. It's just bringing back these memories about my dad being murdered. I thought he just went missing? That's what my mum likes to tell people, but it's not true. I was really young, but I remember bits of that night We were in his car, and he drove me to this building where he used to work, he told me he'd be back He was gone for ages. I got out the car and started walking along the beach That's when I saw this man, he was dressed all in black with this weird gas mask on. I hid before he could see me, and then he left I saw my dad, he was dead -- there was so much blood. I was scared, so I ran, I ran straight to the station and that's... [Interrupting] I love scary stories, mine's much better. It's not a story. Yeah, whatever. You need some gravitas when telling stories, Emily. When I was younger my friend told me a story about a friend who had an exchange student staying with them. He was into hiking, so he'd regularly walk out of the village into the hills. and this one time, he didn't come back. The next morning, the family were worried about him, so they went looking What they found was shocking! His face had been eaten clean off! Was that supposed to be scary? It was shit. My story wasn't shit. Emily's was shit. Mine really happened. That definitely never happened. She's telling the truth, children. I know what happened. I've seen them. They think no one will listen to old Nunny. ...but I know. What is it, sister? What happened? The beast, the beasts got him. They take others, too. Oh my God, did you hear that? She lives by my aunt, she isn't even a real nun, Emily. Crazy bitch! Far too many weirdos in this town. Hello, Grange Club Paula speaking. Can I speak to Emily, please? Emily, it's your mum. Just a minute. Mum, are you okay? I'm fine, Emily, I just need you to tell work that I won't be in for 2 weeks. Oh, okay, mum. I can't talk now, Emily. Some ARSEHOLE wants to use the phone. Mum? Mum?! Fuck's sake. Emily, are you there? Skcos Rellik Evening, Detective Kincaid What can I do for you, Kincaid? I've spent all day with the pathologist. Keith the fisherman was murdered with a cut-throat razor. He had a big beard, didn't he? Yeah, probably slipped shaving. His body was found on the beach. Homeless I think, yeah. Anyway, doesn't matter. It's solved. What is? Project 49. The bike theft? That's what all the fuss was about out in the corridor? Well, yeah. I said I'd take the arresting officer out for a pint. So, I think we should shut up shop and go and celebrate. We can't shut the station. Sir, surely a murder takes priority? Mellow Coast is small-time, we don't do murder. Anyway, I'll catch you later. As part of our Halloween season, we bring you "Sprich mit Geister." And I said to him, "Walt, I just don't do nudity." Wow, interesting. So, why do you waste your time on that weirdo Emily? What, you've worked in this town six months now? I don't think I've seen you take your eyes off her. Don't call her a weirdo, she's just different. She's different, all right. Well, if you ever want a real woman, you know where I am. Mate, what are you doing? What? I like Emily. Yeah, and you never ask her out, you soppy arsehole. I can, she's just delicate. Delicate? Weird, you mean. We must summon your dead father using this Ouija board. Daddy's just gonna grab something, okay? I'll be 5 minutes. Skcos Rellik There's this scene where someone drops something into the paint can. So they reach in to get it, but the paint can's full of razor blades. They pull it out, there's all this blood. They're like "Ahhhh!" Blood everywhere, it's amazing! - Why are you still talking about this? - Ahh, just wait, Bants. I promise ya, it's the bloodiest thing you've ever seen. If there are any spirits present, make yourselves known. How do you know my name? Dad, is that you? No? Then who are you? A friend? Then tell me what's going on? What the fuck? This must've belonged to my dad. The creep from the pub... He must have known my dad. Dr. A. Dr. Lloyd. I think Steve's an idiot if he thinks we're going out in these waters. - Hey, Emily. -You know the creepy guy from the pub? The one Bants chucked out? What's he done now? Nothing, I need to talk to him. I know he hangs around the boat yard sometimes Haven't seen him since last night - He's usually down at his allotment plot. - Oh great, thanks! She seems more interested in creepy old drunks than you, mate. Fuck off. What are those? Gloves. Leather gloves? Oh, so fucking what? Loads of guys wear them. No, Bants. Lots of serial killers wear them. Fuck off. Hello? What the fuck? You shouldn't be here -- now get out of here. You worked with my dad, didn't you? Now get out of here before something bad happens. Dr. Lloyd, who is he in all this? Lloyd is long dead. Now leave! Did you kill them? I didn't kill anybody. Now get out of here, Emily. Your father wouldn't want you mixed up in this. What is going on? You're getting involved in things you don't understand. Leave. Now! I know you're listening. Leave that girl alone. I hope we see lots of boats today. Oh, Nigel, look at that boat. Oh, yes, what a beauty of a boat. Emily? He had a knife! He knew my dad! Who had a knife? The creepy guy from the pub. Where is he now? We were in his shed, I don't know where he is now. What were you doing with that old creep? He knows something. He knew my dad. It's a small town. Everyone knows everyone around here. I don't know what you think this guy knows H's a crazy drunk who lives at the allotment You need to stay away from him, okay? Okay. Do you want me to walk you home? I'll be fine. You sure? Yeah. You know where I am, if you need me. Okay. 6th of November, 1970, test subject 3b is showing signs of growth. Colleagues Dr. A and Dr. Lloyd have come leaps and bounds with their research. But we're constantly hampered by the budget cuts. Next week, we'll inject 3b with steroids He didn't react well to being injected before. Hopefully with special measures in place we should be able to control the reaction better. Do you know the Keith murder from the other night? Well, I've been up all night investigating. He worked for Dexter Corp. when he was a lad, as their cleaner. Then, suddenly it hit me, when I started 10 years ago A little girl came running into the station. She was screaming. Her father, a scientist at Dexter Corp., Tim Trescott, had been murdered. We searched for him for days, but never found any trace of him. Well, what I didn't know was, before I started, another scientist went missing. He turned up dead. And Keith was a suspect in his murder. I don't know, it might just be a coincidence. There's definitely connections here, don't you think? Detective Milky? Huh? Sorry, I'm on a break. But you just got here. And I literally don't give a shit. I guess I'll just go make another coffee. Yes please, two sugars. Look, you've got nothing to do tonight, your shift's about to finish. You can either go home and sit by yourself in an empty house, because your mother's out chasing sugar daddies. Or, you can go and have a nice evening with Dave. I bumped into him yesterday, he does seem like a nice guy. Just do it. Hey, what are you doing tonight? Erm, nothing. Dick. Please remember to lock up this time, the back door was left open last week. Whatever! You know you shouldn't speak to me like that. You know I'm in charge while daddy's away. Well act like it! Oh, sorry, acting's not your strong suit. I'll get you, you stupid bitch. Walk me back? Oh, babe, I'm chilling with... My mates. Fine. Maybe 'round later for some hanky-panky, though. Don't bother. Aww, bless. We could go for a walk down at the front, or... Yeah, arcades? I'm off home. Is Bants not walking you back? Nope, he's drinking with the guys. Home alone tonight, then? Looks likely. We can walk back with you, if you want. No, no. I wouldn't want to intrude on your romantic date. Laters. So, what do you want to do? Arcades? So, why move to this small little town? I needed to get away from things, fancied a change. "Things"? Just the hustle and bustle of the city. So, nothing to do with a girl, then? Nah, nothing like that. It's just, you've been here six months, you've already got Paula chasing after you. I do not like Paula. She's kind of horrendous. I like you. Why? Um... Quirky. Interesting. That's a compliment? It was supposed to be. I like you too. So, what's going on? You looked at that building and freaked out. My dad worked there. Okay...? He found out some secret about the lab. I think they killed him because of it. Oh, Emily, why have I just heard about this? They covered it up. Who's they? The police, the company he worked for; I don't know. You mentioned that guy the other day, he knew your dad? His name is Dr. A. He, my dad, and this other guy They were scientists together at the lab. Keith's murder is bringing back all these old memories Something told me I needed to look into it. That's when I found this old picture of my dad, Dr. A., and this other guy Dr. Lloyd. Where's Dr. Lloyd now? He told me he's dead. Then he wouldn't talk to me about it. Then I noticed he had some of my dad's old tapes, and the knife... Emily, you've got to stay away from the allotment. I'm serious, you need to stay away from him. If he turns up at the pub, which I doubt he will, just tell me and the guys, and we'll sort him out. Okay, thanks. Do you want me to walk you home? Yeah, okay. Come on, then. Thanks for walking me back, I had a nice night. Me too. Aye. Yeah, had a good night. I'll see you soon. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. See you tomorrow. Continuing our Halloween season, we bring you Mario Fulchino's acclaimed horror, 'Striptease Massacre'. You're such a fucking arsehole. Oh, hey, babe, what's up? You, uh, got any beers? You don't need any friggin' beer. You're such an arsehole! I've got a surprise for you, babe. What? Stand up, close your eyes. This is stupid. Babes, hush. Okay, open your eyes. See, I can be romantic too. So, uh, forgiven for scaring you? Yes. So, beer? Yes, beer. You go in and get prepared, I'll go and raid the fridge. [cat meows] Mittens! Babe, I want sex. Oh, I'll settle for head. What the fuck?! What's happened? Don't know, love, another murder, by the looks of it. Aww, I love comics. Who let this girl in? Oh God, what happened? I swear, Milky, you are the most incompetent... Kincaid? So, Emily, tell me what happened to your father. Emily. Are they dead? I'm afraid so. So, your date with Emily went well, then? Billy? Sorry, Dave, this is Billy, Milly's dad. Yeah, you alright? There's no time for pleasantries. Milly told me to come and tell you all... Tell us what? There's been another murder. What? Who? It's Bants and Claudine. I'm very sorry. Oh shit. This is terrible. I'm gonna have to do a double shift. Sir, I need a word. Kincaid, can't you see I'm busy? Yes, but there's been another murder. I know. Do you? Of course. I'm the Chief Inspector. Right. Well, I've been piecing a few things together, and... Do you remember Tim Trescrott's disappearance 10 years ago? Rings a bell. And do you remember the story his daughter Emily told us About him getting murdered? Well, Keith the fisherman, who was murdered Worked with him years ago as a cleaner, and he was a suspect in the murder of another Dexter Corp. employee and then these two kids who died last night, they're friends with Emily, Tim's daughter... And she turned up at the crime scene. Look, Kincaid... I know you used to work in the big city But around here everyone knows everyone. You've been 10 years on this beat, I would expect you to know that by now. Anyway... It was decided that Tim Trescott ran away And his daughter just made up the rest. The case is closed; just a sad child with an overactive imagination. The Dr. Lloyd incident I'd investigated, it was a tragic accident. He was stabbed with a broken mop handle! You really need to drop this, Kincaid. But Sir, that is completely unreasonable I'm the detective on this case. So, investigate the recent incidents, and drop the Trescott stuff. Otherwise, you won't be the detective on this case. Emily! Go away! Oh, Emily. I heard what happened. Are you okay? You can't be here, Dave. What? You're clearly upset. Let me in, you shouldn't be home alone. Don't you see what's happening? First my dad, now Bants and Claudine, everyone I get close to ends up dead. Emily, you're talking nonsense, just let me in, please! Emily, let me in! Fuck's sake Emily, they were my friends, too! It's been some time since my last update. I need to keep better records of what's happening here. The last three weeks provided a fair amount of data, but nothing conclusive. The atmosphere here is hostile, to say the least. Rumors are doing the rounds that Dexter Corp. plan to remove all funding for the project, unless they see more control over the subjects soon. A number of us expressed our concerns about how these tests are being run. Dr. Lloyd has unfortunately been removed from project 'Skcos Rellik'. The team has decided that some of his tests have been creating, shall we say, less than desirable results. What am I saying, they are downright dangerous results! Test subject 11b has been terminated. Dad, is that you? I'm not your father, Emily. But I knew him many years ago! How did you know him? I worked with him at the lab, Emily, and they killed me. Dr. Lloyd? Who killed you? They paid Keith the fisherman to do it! That's why he's dead now, Emily. He was a loose end. They have more loose ends. You need to talk to Dr. A, Emily. He did this. Skcos Rellik... Hey, Emily! -Dave! - Where're you going? - I need to talk to him! This phrase keeps coming up, 'Skcos Rellik'. He was somehow involved with my dad. Who? Oh, please don't tell me you mean that old drunk. He wasn't always a drunk. He was a scientist. A ghost told me. A ghost, Emily? You're not thinking straight. Our friends are dead. This has nothing to do with your father issues. This... Emily, I'm sorry. Fucking hell! I need to talk to you. People are dying, and I need answers. Dr. Lloyd told me to come talk to you. Stupid, I know, talking to a dead man. What exactly is Dexter Corp's role in all of this? Hello? Hello, are you okay? Oi, where are you going? Err, to the pub. There's a murder investigation going on. That's why you're here, Kincaid. Do you really need to go to the pub right now? Have you seen the barmaid in there? She's a right tasty piece. People are being murdered. It's Halloween, nothing bad ever happens on Halloween. Have some fun. And I'll see you tomorrow morning. Afternoon. Maybe. I can't believe Bants is dead. Yeah, it is pretty shit. Maybe we ought to do like a toast, or something? To Bants; he was an arsehole, but he was our arsehole. To Bants. She's just trying to steal the thunder from us after solving the bike theft. Exactly. Anyway... Shall we go to the pub? Yeah, The Grange? The service there is impeccable. He's been murdered! They got him! Who's been what? Someone else has been killed! Something with project Skcos Rellik! I know it is! Right, uh... Kincaid's in there. 'cause... don't care. Fucking mental, that one. Emily, are you okay? There's been another murder! She was hysterical, I think she's losing it. Can't blame her, I guess. Who's hysterical? Emily. She thinks Bants and Claudine's death has something to do with her father. Which doesn't make any sense. She talked about the old allotment. Saying some weird phrase. What phrase? 'Skcos Rellik'. That literally doesn't mean anything, it it's not even words. Scuzz relic? Skcos Rellik. Whatever. Whatever. Thanks. Rest up, Emily. My office is right over there, I've sent some officers over to the allotments. Thanks, Kincaid. Idiot! So, what are you doing later? You know the girl that works here, the one you hate? I don't hate her. She's just a bitch and a slut and I want her to die. Why? What's she done now? Bet it's something weird. In the station, screaming bloody murder about, well... a bloody murder. Another one? Huh. Oh, yeah. This is all obviously hush-hush right. Of course. Tell me more. Don't know who she found dead, just kept shouting these weird words. 'Skcos Rellik'. She probably didn't find anyone dead. She's insane, I knew it all along. But, later on, if you're not busy when this place closes, meet me by the beach. Midnight. Bring friends. Bring wine; not the cheap stuff. Loser. Well, at least I've got a backup plan. To Bants and Claudine. For fuck's sake man Do you have to say that every time? That's like the 15th shot. Okay, okay. I've got a new plan We have like one or ten more of these and then we go back to mine and watch "The Decorator". Wh...what? Oh, come on, it's not like the beach is happening anymore is it? I mean half the original party aren't exactly up for it anymore, are they? What's wrong with you? Oh, come on, it's Halloween. It's just a bit of, you know, gallows humor. Your mates have just been brutally hacked up Just last night! Does that mean nothing to you?! Dave, Dave man, come on Let go of me, you're hurting me! I wasn't even that close to them. Jesus Shot. Wow, I thought you were going to punch him. Dave, I'm going to head off, I'll see you at home, when you've calmed down. Glad that thunderstorm's cleared for now. Who wants to meet on a beach at fucking midnight, anyway? The talent will be here in... Jesus, six hours! Go get that wine out of your car. Okay. Fucking sand gets everywhere. I'm going to be back well late. Going to get it in the neck from the wife. Oh, for fuck's sake. You looked so hot standing up to Jeremy over Claudine and Bants. I loved that girl like a sister. I just get so angry, you know? How angry? Things wind me up so much I just want to lash out and hurt someone. Have you ever done anything about it? I mean, have you ever hurt anybody? No, No. Never even got into a fight. R. E. L. L. I. K. - Going out, or something? - Just going to tell Emily something. I can watch over Emily. Why don't you get off now? I'm fine, Sir. Honestly. You work too hard, Kincaid. Why don't you take a page out of your partner's book? Anyway, I've already sent everyone else home. But Sir, I've had a breakthrough. What kind of breakthrough? You've still got this old thing Well yes, you gave it to me after five years of service. The old chief gave me this. I always hoped that one day you'd do my job. But there's a certain order in this town. You knew, didn't you? I'm sorry that it's come to this. How much did they pay you? Enough. Wake up. Hi. Where's Kincaid? I sent her home for the evening. I'll watch over you. Hehe. What're you doing? Nothing. You know I need to close the bar it's getting pretty late, and you're my only customer. Well, I haven't finished drinking, so... Why don't we get some drinks and go back to yours? Yeah, that's an idea, good. I should go see Jeremy, anyway. Say sorry. He's probably all lonely. Shit. Brilliant, I forgot you lived with him. He wants to... He wants to watch the horror film he imported. Yeah? What's that about? Horror film about... A carpenter...or a house painter... "The Decorator"? Yeah, yeah. That's it. He wants to watch it. Halloween. But it's banned over here?! Yeah... it's banned. Let's do more shots! Yeah... No! I thought we were going? Well, a few more won't hurt. And the less you remember about tonight, the better. Sorry, my love, you can't go in there. Secret police-work, you understand. Sorry. I'll go... I'll go and get a coffee. Yeah. [picks up phone] Fine, I'll do it myself! Come on, let's go. Bye, pub. Can we get chips? Emily likes chips. Every 10 or 15 years, a film is produced that is so overwhelming, so forceful in its impact, that it becomes deeply embedded in the mind. Its intensity may be more than some wish to be exposed to, and those people should be forewarned. So, what's going on with Chad? Ergh. Chad 's a jerk. What did he do this time? He ran off with Courtney. What a jerk. Such a jerk. But I love him, and I'll marry him some day. No way! Anyway, did you hear about those recent murders? The young women murdered by their decorator? Yeah, I heard he painted the walls in their blood. Ergh. Gross. So gross. Oh my God, look at the time! Sorry, you need to go. Oh. Why's that? I have my decorator coming. Oh, okay. Why wouldn't she tell us about this? [Door buzzer rings] Come in, can I get you a coffee? [door buzzer rings] While you set up - [door buzzer rings] I'm going to take a shower Hello, hello? Trick or treat? Here you go. Gee whiz, thanks mister! Little shits. OH! Dave, you arsehole! Who put that there? Of course you live in a basement. So, what colour were you thinking? I think we should go back upstairs. Oh, shit. Here, take that. So, did you come to see your big Hollywood debut? Fucking tell anyone, I'll fucking kill you! I came here to fuck Dave! How was I supposed to know he couldn't handle 32 shots?! Wait, wait! Maybe, you know... You and I could... You know... Yeah, well, I saw your tits already, anyway! Just you and me tonight then, buddy. Milky? Better have bought some good wine, or I won't let you penetrate me tonight. I knew your father. Did you? Well, I had dealings with Dexter Corp. Who were you on the phone with just now? You remind me so much of him. Causing trouble for us all. Affecting this town's bottom line. I don't understand. At one time, half the town were on their payroll. I was sent to cover up the mess after they sent Keith to kill Dr. Lloyd. But then they left When everything nearly came out because of your father. There're still a few of us who remain to protect their interests. I think I'd like to leave now, please. Kincaid! Where are you, you bitch?! I'm going to fuck up your face like you've done mine, you bitch! Hello? Ooo! This film is so fucked up, ain't it? Can you please try not to die? I'm trying to watch this film. What? Do you want a drink or something? That is gross, you are so gross! [door buzzer rings] There're no sweets left. I said there're no fucking sweets left! Go home! Goddamn kids never fucking listen to anyone! You kids, there there aren't any -- Sweets. More beers. Dave, did you break that fucking film? Dave? Oh, I can't see a fucking thing down here. I think I've been sick a little bit. Dave? Dave? Oh my God, Dave? Dave, wake up! Dave... Dave. I'm sorry, Dave. Jeremy? Dave is dead. What... What's wrong with your face? I've hidden some items in the basement of the lab. In case... in case things go bad. I can no longer be a part of this project. There's been a cost to human life. The security is no longer able to keep the test subject secure. I suspect that my wife is complicit in the General's plans. I fear for my daughter's safety. I need some answers. Dad? I'm nervous about how things are going. We only have one of the original unattached test subjects left alive. A number of the patients Dr. A was able to graft have been thriving. It seems the casing might be the key to keeping them alive whether that's a good thing or not, I'm yet to decide. I'm concerned about the intentions of the general. Happy Halloween, you cunt. What... What the fuck? Dr. A. Dr. A, if you are listening to this... I know we're experimenting on animals and the subjects were able to take them over But I had no idea they were able to do the same with humans. I think the general could have been taken over by one of these creatures they seem to attach themselves to the foot of the host. The beasts, the beast got him. They take others, too. Which is why I've named this project... Skcos Rellik Skcos Rellik Or, when reversed... Killer socks. Congratulations, Emily. You managed to kill a puppet. Would you like to meet the thing that pulled its strings? [screaming] What, bitch? Never seen a killer sock before? You're a fucking sock?! You couldn't let it go, could you? You had to go and tell everyone about what we did to your dad and his friend. You kept running your mouth, Emily. The more you spoke, the more we killed. It's all your fault. We took each and every one of your loud-mouthed friends. You might as well just let us tear the flesh from your face. Who do you even have left to care about you? ME! You can't! I hate odd socks! Who are you? Don't you recognize your own father, Emily? Since that night, I've been hunting these things, but I didn't realize they were still such a presence in this town. I'm sorry, Emily. I thought by keeping away I'd keep you safe. But I was wrong. What happened to you? You look so different? Being stabbed 72 times, a decade on the road hunting monsters, it changes a man, Emily. But I assure you, I am Tim. I am your father. But? They're here. There's more of them? Of course, they always come in pairs. We've gotta get out of here. I'm gonna hold you back, I can't walk by myself. You wait here, Emily I'm gonna check if the coast is clear. Come on, Emily there're more coming. I can't believe you just shot a nun! I'm sorry for bringing this upon you Emily. Who are they? Well, they would have been people. But now... They're just tools for the socks. [chanting] Emily. Baby, come to your mother. Mum? Mother loves you, Emily. Come to mother. That's not her, Emily, that's the thing that killed her. I know. I can't remember the last time she told me she loved me. There's so many of them. You think this is a lot? You ain't seen nothing yet. None of this makes any sense. No? You ever wondered why you lose so many odd socks? My God! Emily... I've met God, and even she couldn't prepare you for what's about to happen. Are you ready for this? Dad, I've been waiting my whole life for this. Okay, you motherfucking sock cunts, who wants some?!
