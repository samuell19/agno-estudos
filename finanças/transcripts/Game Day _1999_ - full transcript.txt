[♪] [radio announcer] Hey, fellow Greenlawn-ians, if you're not up yet, shame on you. This is the biggest day Greenlawn, New York has ever seen, and the adrenaline should have rushed to your brain hours ago. It's a typical March day outside, 36 degrees, 15 degrees with the wind chill factor, with a 98% chance of rain. And now, I have the pleasure of welcoming the honorable John Davis, mayor of our fair city. So, Mr. Mayor, do you have a prediction for tonight's big game?

[gulp] [gulping] [exhale] [gulping] [sigh] [music continues ♪] [sigh] [coughs] Good morning. [clink] [rustling sound] [scratch] [whoosh] [sharp inhale] [newscaster] And good morning, Greenlawn! [laughs] We'll continue our coverage here this morning of the top news story of the day. Before this season started, the college basketball rules committee introduced a new rule which said that the two teams in the final would flip a coin to determine a home team for the championship game, rather than playing at some neutral site. All involved supported the idea but support shifted when our own St. Joe's shocked the planet by not only making the tournament, but making it to the finals, and then won the coin toss, to boot. When the league realized that this meant the championship game would be played in the modest MacDougall Gymnasium on St. Joe's campus, they, along with the Miami State Lightning, filed for emergency injunction to move the game to the civic center at Utica. [ominous chording ♪] Well, justice won out in the end, as the court rejected the injunction and upheld St. Joe's right to play the game on our home court. Representing our town in this victory was Greenlawn's top legal mind, Frank Wilson who had this to say, after the court was persuaded by his argument: The fine people of Greenlawn deserve to have the game played in their own gym. And thank God, in this wonderful country of ours, that you usually get what you deserve. [dramatic whoosh ♪] [newscaster] Well, there was a decidedly different reaction from the best player in the country, Miami State's Montgomery Clarke. I think it's a bunch of bull-[bleep] That gym is so small they only gave me one ticket to the game. My mom can't even go. That's alright, though. It'll all be better when we bust [bleep] on their home court. Well, Montgomery doesn't look too excited there. That'll change, I bet, if he manages to lead Miami State to their next championship.

[girls laugh] Alright, cut this shit. [girls giggle] Come on, I mean it. I got a rule. No double-coming on game day. [disbelieving laughter] Excuse me? You heard me. And if I was ever planning to break a personal rule, I wouldn't choose the day of the national championship game to do it. [laughter] [sigh] Come on, I'm serious. Get the fuck out. Poof. Pow. Be gone. Fine. [annoyed breath] [music continues ♪] ♪ I'm a lover ♪ [music cuts] I'll see you tonight... Dickhead. Unfortunately, the sad reality is you ain't gonna have much to cheer about. I am not just cheering. I am the feature dancer on the Reebok Halftime Aerobics Team, thank you. - Really? - Yeah. They said there's gonna be talent agents in the crowd. [gasps] They did, did they?

How could I be anything but happy with a family like this. [giggles] [woman, melodically] Is this the little girl I carried? Is this my little girl at play? Mother, stop it. You're embarrassing me. Embarrassing you? I bathed you. Fred, how did she grow up so fast? That's my little Suzie Q. Hi, Babs. Hi, Suzie. So, are you excited for the game? You will be watching out for your big sister on TV? Of course she's excited. Who in their right mind wouldn't be excited about the game? Your father can hardly sleep at night thinking about this game. Coach Adler is a genius, and St. Joe's has got him. I'd rather have Adler coaching than Montgomery Clarke playing for my team. Well, I just think Coach Adler is so cute. He is the captain of his ship, and his ship goes down over his dead body. That's the kind of commitment he gives you. You should admire that. We should all look to him as a role model. [rock music plays ♪] [deep inhale] Ah, shit. [heavy thud] I have never seen another coach throw him a defense or an offense that he didn't figure out and pick apart. Man, I love that guy. Is that all you can talk about? Coach Adler and the game? What about the Reebok Halftime Aerobics Team and its future dancer? Oh, I'm sure that's all anyone can think about today, Ms. Ego. Daddy, will you say something to her? Barbara, apologize to your sister. [insincerely] Sorry, Suzie. Apology accepted. Now, have you told everyone about my show tonight? Oh, honey, everyone we know will be watching the game, so they'll see you. You mean you didn't call everyone? Well, how will they know to look for me? Well, we've told all the people that we're close with about the halftime aerobic team. And, anyone that we didn't tell, they're bound to see it. After all, you are the featured dancer. That's true. I suppose you're right, Daddy. That's our understanding baby. When she comes home from her sorority house instead of a napkin, can you set me a vomit bag? Barbara, what kind of talk is that? Apologize to your mother. [insincerely] Sorry, Mother. Apology accepted. Suzie... Are you going to spend the day with us, or do you have some last minute aerobics to practice? Oh, I can't stay. Dave's frat house is having a pre-game party. Are you sure it's not a pre-halftime, aerobics show party? Barbara! [insincerely] Sorry, Suzie. You know, Daddy, you should apologize to me, too. I still can't believe you didn't get tickets for tonight. [Helen, on phone] Hello? Oh, honey, you know I'd be too nervous to watch your big number live, in person. [Helen] You want who? I'd rather watch it on TV. [Helen] - Your name is what? - And sit in my lucky chair. I just know it's gonna bring you luck. Fred, there's someone on the phone, and I... I-I-I think it's a wrong number, but he won't believe me. Do you want to handle it? Sure. He says his name is Zippy. Hello? [Zippy] Hello, scumbag. Oh, yes, uh, hi. How are you? Uh, please forgive me Oh, ye-yes, I have that information for you in my study. Could you hold on a moment, please? Thank you. Um, heh... This... eh... um. Heh. I'll just, uh, take it in my study. Why are you calling here? Oh, I'm sorry, scumbag. Is this bad for you? I didn't realize. The thing is, I thought you wanted some action tonight. We took care of that yesterday. Uh, Mr. Segal would like to personally review the situation. Okay, so what did he say? No, scumbag. When I say Mr. Segal wants to personally review the situation, I mean he wants to review the situation with you. Personally. I have to meet him? Oh, my God... Why? 'Cause Mr. Segal said so, scumbag. Okay, okay, um... Where? At his club, Magic Nipple. It's on Tulip Lane. Be there before 3:30. Anytime before 3:30, okay? - Okay. - Okay, scumbag. [suspenseful bells ♪] [ticking] [boing] Is this all you need? Yeah. That's it. Oh, Coach Adler. Please don't insult me by offering me money for this lightbulb. Aren't you in the business of selling things like... lightbulbs? Yes, of course. Well, don't you think you'd make more money if you charged people for 'em? Oh, Coach Adler. Yes, I charge people. But you're not people. You're Coach Adler. Coach of St. Joe's, coach of the Red Wave, and I would not think of charging the coach of the Red Wave for a light bulb on such a glorious day. I just think you're wonderful, Coach Adler. What you've done for this town, it's like the gods brought you to us. [sudden inhale] Go Red Wave! Thank you very much. Hey! Moron Boy! Are you just gonna stare from over there, like a imbecile? You just stare at the coach and don't say nothin', like a mute! And on top of it, you don't do no work, neither! Hey, hey! Hey, hey! [determinedly] Go Red Wave! [bell rings] Can I help you with something? Uh, yes. Yes, you can. I couldn't help noticing the signs you have outside your store, showing Red Wave spirit, and I kinda thought that you would want a Red Wave costume. Let me ask you something. Are you going to the game tonight, or are you watching it on TV? [chuckles] I got seats. Blue section, first row. Well, there you go. Those are terrific seats. You are definitely gonna want one of these. [zipping] This, my dear, is the official Red Wave costume, designed by Epsilon Delta Phi fraternity, and if you really want to show 'em who you're rooting for... Yeah! ...you'll have one of these. Wow! How much? A mere 30 dollars. - Let me get my bag. - Right. Hey, man. Yo! [metal cans clattering] You going to the game tonight? Me? Yeah, you. You going to the game? I'm not sure. There may be no point. You been talking to Moron Boy, over there? Moron Boy, why aren't you working? I've done everything. Thank you very much. And... Here you go. So, how much do I have to pay you to help me put it on? It's one-size-fits-all, right? Well, I guess we're about to find out, right? Hey, buddy? If you, um, change your mind about the costume you can stop by Epsilon Delta Phi anytime today, and we'll hook you up. Alright? Take it easy. [bell rings] Why do you just stand there, Moron Boy? Do something! Dust the shelves! I dusted the shelves twenty minutes ago. [clatter, grunt] [thud, glass shatters] Dust it again! I'm paying you, and you're gonna work! [exhale] [cough] [machine beeps] [Julie] Uh, hi, Steve? [giggles] Coach? Uh, Coach Steve? [giggles] It's Julie, from the law school party. Which one was Julie? Well, I had an excellent time hanging out with you, and, well, when you asked me to go with you to the game tonight, I wasn't really sure whether or not you were serious. I mean, do you have time for a first date while you're coaching in the national championships? I was probably serious. Well, we were both pretty plowed, so you may have been totally kidding. Oh, God, how totally retarded will I feel if you weren't serious? For Christ's sake, I was serious. Well, I'm out and about all day shopping, so it's pointless to leave my number. But, I'll tell you what, I'll try back one more time later today. If you want me to be your first lady of basketball, just pick up the phone, and if not, well... [giggles] I'm a complete fool, and it was totally exciting meeting you the other night. [giggles] Um, hope to speak to you soon. Bye. [click] [beep] [ex-Mrs. Adler] You stinking piece of shit! Where's the goddamn money you promised? You know, Steven, it comes as no surprise that you treat me like shit and trample all over my life, but your little daughter? How do you find it so easy to sleep at night knowing that you treat her like shit, too? Listen to me, you stinking swine: You're going to pay her damn college tuition, and until you do, I'm going to hound you like a dog. I'm gonna call you, and follow you, and embarrass and harass you until you pay every last dime the courts ordered you to, you stinking, miserable, bastard.

And then burn in Hell. [click] [beep] [sigh] And I was so in love with that woman... [click] [whoosh] [ringing] [ringing] [Julie] Coach Steve? Julie... Thank God. [giggles] Well, if you're not taking me to the game, you are officially the biggest tease on the face of the planet. Hey, Julie, I may be many things, but a tease is not one of them. Oh, my God, this is so cool. I'm gonna be the high priestess of hoops. Hey, listen, I hope you're not just coming to the game for, uh, status. I'm offended you'd think I'd be influenced by such shallow considerations. So, do we have great seats? Well, my seats are a little closer than yours, but yours comes with less responsibility. [giggles] So, how do we hook up? Should I meet you there, or...? Come over right now, we could spend some time... Oh, come on. You're kidding now, right? I mean, don't you have to prepare for the game, or something? Well, I'm prepared for the game. If you're prepared for the game. [giggles] Well, I'm going over some last minute strategy, but I can come over right after that. Sounds good to me. I live at... ...744 Forest Lane. [giggles] Okay, see you soon. [click] [dial tone] Prepare for the game... [sharp inhale] That's what I thought I was doing. [deep exhale] This exhibition baseball is bullshit. Every damn one of them guys is going to be in the minors in about a month. I mean, look at that sorry bitch on the mound. That boy can't pitch. Shit, I kicked that motherfucker's ass at stickball last week. Alright, that's good, Mikey. Turn this shit off... Look, Mikey... There he is, the man of the hour. What up, boys? Wassup, man? Who's the munchkin? Fuck you, homie. [laughter] Check out the mouth on the munchkin. Shut the fuck up. Yo, H, man, that's my little brotha'. I gotta mind his business all damn week. No one's got to mind my business, I've got it covered. Yeah, you got it covered. You don't say "fuck you" to H. Not to the man. And definitely not in his domain. And most certainly not on a day he's playing for the national fuckin championship. You should look up to guys like H. Give him respect. You should think of H as your role model. Oh, Willie... What kind of head-up-your-ass advice is that to be giving to an impressionable kid from the ghetto? [incredulous sound] Back off, Jerome. Come on, Harry, you know you should not be any black kid's role model. Well, pardon my ass, Mr. Mandela, but how many minutes are you playing in tonight's championship game? Well, let's see... If the game's a blowout, I'll play two less minutes than you will. And if it's close... Well, the only difference between me and you is that you're in the lay-up lines. It's not my fault Coach is doggin' me! The coach dogs you 'cause you're a dog. Bullshit! I'm the best fucking athlete on the whole team. Best athlete on the whole team? This mother fucker is the best athlete in the whole motherfuckin' league. Just because you're the best athlete does not mean you're not a dog. What makes him such a dog? You want an example? Yeah. I guess we'll have to venture all the way back to, uh, this morning. Now, you would think that a ball player dedicated to the team goal of winning would want to get a good night's rest on the eve of the national championship game, rather than doing the Hokey Pokey all night long with two white chicks 'til the middle of the morning. [laughter] See, you a lying motherfucker. I had them bitches out by eight. A'ight! And no matter what I did last night, that still don't change the fact that Coach is doggin' me. Only reason I don't play is 'cause... He a racist! [chuckles] Now, that's pathetic. Fuck you! You don't know shit! Coach hates niggas! Well, that's an interesting assertion, considering that most of the team's starters are black. So what? I'm the most black. Oh, man, you're not seriously going to continue this debate. [chuckles] Fuck you, you heard me! I'm the most black. I'm the darkest. I'm the funkiest. I got the biggest dick. You know what I think, Jerome? I think the only reason you losing your shit on me over this is 'cause you got a guilty conscience for being so white. For being... ...so white? You heard me, Poindexter. [sharp exhale] Oh, well... You certainly were right there, Willie. He does make a good role model. After all, reading books isn't good. Reading books is white. Why you being so fucked up for? I can't deal with this motherfucker this morning. Stay out of my face. It's the afternoon for the rest of us. [sound of contempt] Look, here. Choose your role models wisely, little brotha. Two white girls together? I'm down with that! [laughter] My man... [hand slap] Come here, boy. You crazy. [snoring] [ticking] [radio plays country ♪] You know... I'm really thinking about going. I mean it. I really may go to the game. I really may do it. I'm really thinking about it. I might just go over to Epsilon Delta Phi and buy a big costume. I'd buy a big costume, and wear it to the game. So, you think I should, or...? [lisping] For Christ's sake, why do you ask me? Who should I ask? Ask yourself. Maybe for once in your life, you can ask yourself something. Make your own decision. So, you think I should make my own decision? [exasperated noises] Oh, for Christ's sake! [ring] [softly, to self] Oh, please be the hot one. Please... Be the hot one. Oh, Jesus... [ring] Coming. [giggles] [laughter] Hey, Julie... There he is, the man of the hour. [giggles] Come on in. Come on, it's cold. Wow. Can I take your, uh, earmuffs? Or your coat? [giggles] You can take both. Ah, that's pretty. Thank you. [zipping sound] Aah. Why don't you have a seat? I think I'll do that. [♪] It's... kinda dark in here, don't you think? Ooh, uh... Yeah, I guess you're right. Unfortunately, I don't have much light. Neither does Greenlawn. [laughter] So, why don't you get more light? If only it were that easy. [laughter] So... This is so outrageously exciting. We could go all the way. [grunt] [giggles] You're pretty excited about the game. You picked up on that, did you? Let me ask you a question. How come you don't seem nervous, or excited, or... ...anything? I'm all of those things. [scoff] Some wine? Wine? Now? Yeah, why not? This isn't some sort of religious holiday for you. Aren't you coaching in some sort of sporting event real soon? Yeah, but you know... What's wrong with, you know, one drink to... loosen up? Okay. You're the coach... ...Coach Steve. Why do you keep calling me "Coach Steve?" It makes me sound like the child molester who runs the after-school program. [laughter] Well, up until a few days ago, I knew you as Coach Adler, one of my heroes. So I'd feel silly calling you Steve. But, calling you Coach Adler isn't appropriate for a personal relationship, so, "Coach Steve," I think, is perfect. [groan] Well, I'm really, really glad that it works for you. - Oh, wait. - What? [giggles] What happened? This glass is filthy. Wha... get out of here... Oh, geez, uh, um... It's really dusty. I-I'm so sorry. This is... This is terrible. [giggling] [horn music on radio ♪] So, uh, where you from? What makes you think I'm not from Greenlawn? [blowing sound] [cough] Well, I dunno... You don't have that dull, product-of-incest, look about you. [laughing scoff] Hey! Be nice. So, what year of law school are you in? Second. Oh, Christ. That's a tough year. You take all your classes, have to land that big summer job, and then, well then you have to do all that research for that journal that you have to join to improve your resumé. Law school survivor? [deep inhale] Oh! Did you ever practice? For about a year. Really? So, why'd you leave it so quickly? It sucked. [laughter] Yeah, I guess it's a lot more fun being the best basketball coach in the universe. Tendency to exaggerate in my favor... I like that in a woman. [laughter] Exaggerate? You took Kentucky to five championship games. And we lost every one of 'em. I know. How does something like that happen? I don't know. How's the wine? Oh, mmm, not bad, for a bottle with a screw-off cap. [giggling] [stammering] How the hell did you know that? I took it off in the kitchen. I can see the ridges on the neck of the bottle! Oh, gee... [stammering] The Greenlawn Liquor Bar ran out of the bottle with the cork. If you hate this town so much, what are you doing here? I just got burned out on the major college sports, so I said, you know, I'm just gonna move to a dipshit town. But, here I am again. In the championship game. But do you realize, win or lose tonight, you will have given every single person in this town the thing they'll be proudest of for the rest of their lives. No shit. So you wanna get high? [scoff] Get stoned? Now? Yeah, why not? It'll be fun, you know? We'll... we'll get stoned, and then you can... ...you can help me make up a game plan. [laughter] Hey.

I mean, especially in a town like Greenlawn. You see, Fred, I used to be a jeweler. On 47th Street, in Manhattan. Heh, heh, ho, that's tough business. There are real sharks in those waters. I didn't want to have to compete like in the jewelry business, so I came here, you know... ...where only goyimlive. Now I don't have to compete with the Yiddishe Kop. They are killers. Listen to what I'm telling you. I-I-I can imagine. So, let us take a look at what we've got here. You owe me a quarter million dollars, hm? Correct. And you want to place a bet on tonight's game. You want to bet St. Joe's, even up, no line. You want to bet $50,000 on St. Joe's, which we are offering at five to one. That's exactly right. Eh, but this is the problem, Fred. You owe me a quarter of a million dollars. That's a big tab to run up. A lot of people could not pay such a tab in a million years. Now, you want to bet a five to one longshot on St. Joes winning outright. That would exactly wipe the slate clean. [exasperated sigh] If I would owe somebody more than I could pay, I would be willing to risk owing them even more if I could have the last chance to break even. Oh, that's not what it is, I swear. Fred, Fred, Fred. You are a nice guy, but... ...you got to do something more than swearing. Look, I'm not stupid. I know that I have to pay back whatever I owe. Here's my plan: To pay you off, I have to sell my house. So, the thing is, I can get $400,000 for it, easy. So, if I have to pay you the $250,00 I owe you now, or the $300,000 if I lose tonight, I still have to sell my house. It makes no difference. [tired groan] Ah, this is what I'm going to do. I've seen your house. I've seen the house. It's beautiful. Beautiful. There's no question about it. You're gonna get a good price, but first... ...I'm gonna have my lawyer do a title search to make sure you really own the house. And then a lien search to make sure there are no debts on it. If it all checks out, you're booked. If St. Joe's loses, then my real estate department will put your house on the market, and whatever we get over 300 is yours. If we don't sell within... [mumbles] ...45 days... ...you give me the deed, and move out. Wha... What do I get? Your life. [funky r&b plays ♪] Hmm. Hey, handsome. What's your pleasure? Ooh. [sighs] Why don't you just sit down here next to me... ...so we can talk. [giggles] Sorry, but things as dirty and potentially damaging as talking are strictly prohibited here. However, if you'd like, I can play with my tits in your face while I wiggle my ass to the music. I could live with that. [♪] Oh, you never have to talk. Do you know what? I wouldn't mind telling you about my day if you wouldn't mind. Sure. - Yeah? - Oh, sure. It was, a, uh, typical morning, you know? And from out of the blue, I get this... ...I get this phone call from this, uh... ...pretty cool woman, you know, and she... ...wants to come over to my place. So she gets over, and, uh... ...she seduces me, and then... ...right in the middle, she stiffs me... ...and walks out. [sharp exhale] How far did she get? [laughs] Well... uh... ...she was giving me a... ...you know. A blowjob? Exactly. Yeah. But then, suddenly, for absolutely no reason at all, she gets up, she stops, and leaves. [exhale] So what wold you like me to do about it? Well... ...I wouldn't mind if you picked up where she left off. [scoffs] [sighs] I bet you wouldn't. So, hey, what? What happened to the no... ...sitting and talking policy? Yeah, I'm gonna make an exception, just this once. You know, the only problem, Mr. Basketball, is that while I'm sure the fascinating story of your day is based on some kernel of truth, you are basically just full of shit. Now knowing that what probably happened is you lured a coed back to your... ...immaculate apartment... ...you impressed her by humbly playing up your celebrity, and then leveraged it for some cheap sex. But somehow, in the middle of the act, just in the nick of time... ...she found out who and what you really are. Adler... Why are you messing around with coeds and strippers on the day of the championship game? Does this mean that you're not gonna pick up where she left off? [derisive snort] I don't think what you need right now is to get off. What you need is to get your shit together so you're fresh for the game. But judging by the way you look... ...it's probably too late for that. You really think that what I do this afternoon could possibly affect my performance tonight? Well, how could it be any other way? [sighs] I'm good at the game. That's what I'm good at. Everybody's good at something. And I'm good at the game. My team couldn't have a better chance of winning this game with any other coach in the country. I'm good at the game. Then why don't you just stop drinking already, okay? Straighten up, Coach. A lot of people are counting on you. Get the fuck back to work, Cassandra. Oh, Christ. Schmuck. Sorry, honey... No, sweetheart... ...this one's on me. You know... I-I-I've been listening very patiently, and I remain unconvinced that the best thing for me right now... ...wouldn't be a blow job. [soft kiss] [whispers] Get it together, Coach. What does that mean? [sighs] I don't know. Maybe try jogging. [♪] [coughing] [splattering sound] [pained exhale] Shit! Good afternoon, Coach. Afternoon, Bill. People are still littering. Huh? Those bastards. Some people never change. Hey, another beautiful March afternoon in Greenlawn, huh, Billy? Oh, March in Greenlawn... In like a lion, out like a combination between Cujo and my relatives. Cold bothers you so much, why come out and jog? Futile attempt at... ...trying to get my blood circulating again. Why don't you stop trying to do to yourself whatever it is you're doing to yourself that stops the blood from moving in the first place? Oh, try to do certain things... ...keep myself numb. Why? Bill, haven't you been paying any attention? Life sucks. Come on, Coach. Life's wonderful. No, Bill. You're wrong. What are you, blind? Don't you understand? I mean, the more you achieve in life... ...the less you have to live for. And then when you get to where you wanna go, where do you go from there? I'm not blind. I understand. I'm where I want to be, so I stayed there. Oh, Christ, Bill... ...how can you even claim to understand what I'm sayin' I mean, with all due respect, Bill... ...you say you're where you want to be and you're a garbage man. Not even a garbage man in a union, for Christ's sake. And even if you were truly where you wanted to be... ...what if you were the kind of person who just couldn't stay anywhere forever? Huh? Then what? How could you know you're not the kind of guy who could stay anywhere forever before you got to where you truly want to be. All those years, you went to the finals with Kentucky, you never won it all, did you? Perhaps you're not where you want to be, yet. And who knows? Maybe you'll get there tonight. Isn't it ironic? You're happy, and I'm... ...I'm miserable. Can you imagine how happy you'd be if you were me? I would have thought so, before this conversation. [hip hop music plays ♪] Shit. That brother of yours better get here soon. I got things to do, and I gotta be in the locker room by 5:00. Go to the fucking game. I've got it covered. Listen, munchkin, you don't got nothing covered. You only nine years old. How much could you possibly cover in nine years? Damn, you spent the first three years of your life trying to figure out how not to shit in your pants. Face it, you only nine years old, and you don't know shit. The only thing I have to face is listening to this bullshit all fucking weekend. I thought you were cool. Yeah, I'm cool. I sleep with a different ho every night. Sometimes two, three at a time. I never go to classes, you know that? Some teachers pass me just 'cause I'm on varsity. Some fail me. But it don't matter, right? Been in this damn place for the last four years. Truth be told, it'll probably take me another four just to get my degree. [laughter] Oh, right, that's the funniest fucking thing I ever heard. See, that just shows you. You don't know shit. I'm one of the lucky ones. I play ball, so I got to come to this white ass, hick town and go to school. So what's the fucking point? The point is I blew it. When I got here, I had an outside shot at the NBA. A chance to get a degree. But I've thrown both away because I had it covered. Now it's over. My team is playing in the national championship game, and I won't step one foot on the court, because I've been such a dog. And you know what I'll probably do tomorrow? Pack up all my stuff, and go back to being another nigga in the hood who didn't amount to shit. You understand what I'm saying? Learn from other peoples' mistakes, Munchkin. That's what makes you smart. Lose the attitude. Start learning from other peoples' mistakes. [creaking door] For real... yeah, yeah. Hey, wassup, homie? Little homie, what's up, baby? [slap] So how ya two gettin' along, huh? Yo, Willie, your boy here... He's a walking after school special. Gettin' into my shit since you left. Tellin' me about blowing his chances. He's a fucking pussy. [laughter] Fuck you, Jerome. [tense music playing ♪] [announcer, on TV, speaking] I think St. Joe's has got a real chance to pull off the upset tonight. [second announcer] Ah, come on, Phil. What have you been smoking? I mean, how much is the network paying you to spread this propaganda about a real game tonight? [laughter] [Phil] No, I'm serious. Look, you can't deny that Adler's got this team running like the fine precision time piece I'm wearing on my wrist. [second announcer] Listen very closely, Phil. Montgomery Clarke and his friends are gonna come to Podunk, New York get up a full head of steam, and crush the Red Wave, and your fancy precision time piece.

It's the national championship game, featuring the Cinderella, St. Joe's Red Wave, and the Miami State Lightning. I'm Kenny Albert, along with my partner, Batt Johnson, as we come to you from... ...the tiny MacDougall Gymnasium in upstate Greenlawn, New York. A most unlikely of venues. Huddle up. Huddle up! Well... Welcome to the championship game. Gentlemen... It doesn't even feel quite real yet, does it? [tongue click] You know how I know that's how you feel? Because there's not one fucking single guy in this locker room who looks focused. Fuck! You're gonna walk out on that court with these scared, chickenshit looks on your faces... ...Miami will smell that a mile away and eat you for fucking dinner. So wipe those looks off your faces and show me some intensity, some focus. You know... ...if you wear focus and intensity on the outside, you can start feeling it on the inside. So show me. Now! Batt, as you know, for the first time a coin toss was held to determine which team in the championship game would host the final. Now this plan came under much scrutiny, in fact, the league filed an injunction to try and move the game 50 miles from here to the Utica Civic Center, however, St. Joe's fought, and they prevailed. [indistinct clamor] [rip] I'd think it's important enough to stress, one more time, the four keys in beating the Miami Lightning. And trust me... ...if we commit to these four keys, I don't give a shit... ...what anyone says. We have a chance to beat these motherfuckers. So let's go over 'em one more time. What the fuck... Number one... [smack] They're a better team. So shorten the game. Makes fuckin' sense. How do you do that? Tough... ...in-your-face... ...defense. Number two... ...a patient and disciplined offense. I do not want to see a shot other than a dunk or a lay-up, until 20 seconds have run off... ...that game clock. Is that understood? Good. Alright, number two. Foul hard. Nothing easy. Let me tell you something... ...they're gonna come at us extra hard, right outta the gate to see whether we back down, so they can blow us out, or... ...whether we're gonna dig down real, real deep... ...and give them everything we fucking got. You see, if they don't intimidate us, they can't blow us out. You dig? Now... ...if Montgomery... ...or any other of their media fucking darlings... ...drives hard to the hoop... ...I want one of you guys to either stuff the shot... ...or knock him on his fucking ass. Are you listening to me, Mr. Terminator? Foul hard. Nothing easy. Nothing easy! [crowd booing] [music playing ♪] [indistinct jeering] You believe we gotta play in this shit box? And these fans... ...when's the last time they've been fed? - You suck! - Go home! [many fans booing] As you guys probably know by now, there's a guy on that team named Montgomery Clarke. You know, they have many, many other good players on their team. However, we have to look to help out anybody... ...who is on Montgomery. So I"m gonna send down as many different guys as I can, in a rotation... ...because we cannot allow him... ...to take over this game. Is that understood? Number four... Montgomery. Ah, I'm sick of that name. Trash talk. Alright, Montgomery might be the best player in the country. Big fuckin' deal. He's also the number one trash talker in this country. I hate trash talk. However... ...if I coach Montgomery... ...I would insist upon it, and you know why? Because he thrives on it. Therefore, you guys, under no circumstances, and I repeat, under no circumstances, engage him when he trash talks. You got it? Good. I mean, come on... ...let's face it, huh... ...most people think it's a fuckin' miracle that we're here in the first place. [derisive sniff] You guys got nothin' to prove. In the eyes of the entire fucking world, you guys are heroes, regardless what happens tonight. Oh, but man, if we win... ...man, oh fuckin' man... [snickers] ...you guys better be prepared to hear about yourselves... ...forever. Every fucking year around this time in March... ...the night the impossible happened... ...in butt-fucking Greenlawn. [agreeing chuckles] You know, I've been to the big dance before. You know that. And I know what a team looks like... ...when they're ready. Unfortunately... ...I always fuckin' played against them.

[crowd erupts] [indistinct cheering and hollering] Well, Kenny, as you know, some of the original thinking behind the rule change was to try to introduce a little excitement into the finals, and as you can tell by what's going on in Greenlawn right now, they've definitely achieved that.

[liquid sloshing] [Kenny] Welcome back to our coverage of the national championship. As hard to believe as this may be, Coach Adler wasn't always a basketball coach. You see, an intellectual by nature, Steven Michael Adler graduated from Harvard Law School, and after a very brief and unsuccessful legal career, he became a high school basketball coach. Not just any high school basketball coach, but one of the best. From there, he moved on to the University of Kentucky, where he took five different teams to the championship game. However Adler was never able to bring home the big one. He did not win any national titles. Adler then moved on to St. Joe's, and it has never really been quite clear what caused him to leave Kentucky, although many rumors circulated about a run-in between Adler and the University of Kentucky administration. [rock music ♪] [moaning] [knock] Daddy, you're home. [giggling] Good afternoon... ...Dean Phillips. [giggling] [Kenny] Yes, Steven Adler has been dabbling in sports for quite some time, now. He's certainly been through a lot, but seems to be back on the right track once again. And we'll be back with more from the national championship game right after these messages. [cheering] [whistling] [band playing ♪] [cheerleaders] Two, four, six, eight! Lightning strikes Miami's... Whoa! [surprised yell] [crowd noise continues] [in unison] Hey! Da da, da da. Hey! Da da, da da! [station identification riff ♪] Welcome back to our coverage of the national championship game. As everybody knows, tonight's game features two of the nation's best coaches, as well as the nation's top player. It does not feature another player whose career has taken a bit of a different path, as our Batt Johnson explains, on a tale of two players. [Batt] Well, you know, four years ago Montgomery Clarke was the leading scorer at Brooklyn High, averaging 27 points a game in his senior year. The second highest scorer on that team was another senior, Harrison Williams. He averaged 20 points a game, and together, they were a strong duo. Now Harrison was considered a schoolyard legend for his work on the blacktop, Montgomery was considered a more disciplined player, and therefore had a lot more to invest in. Montgomery got the high profile scholarship with Miami, and then Harrison got the low profile scholarship with St. Joe's. Montgomery made the most of his opportunity, working his way toward becoming the best player in the country. And, although unfortunately, this Cinderella story of St. Joe's is somewhat inspiring, the sad fact is that Harrison may very well not make it into the game. And again, he usually doesn't. It's just another sad case of the schoolyard legend throwing away his potential. What the fuck are you doing? What happened? [unidentified player] It's a spill, coach. What are you sitting around watching that horseshit television for? You're gonna tighten up before tip off. Get the fuck on the court, stay stretched. Jesus... What's this, a pick up game? Jesus... [crowd noise fades] [dramatic chord ♪] [crowd noises] Coach, I gotta talk to you. Hold on a sec. Huh? Talk to me? What, now? You know I'm a little busy with the game starting so soon, you know what I mean? It's important. Oh, Christ. What's up? You gotta start me, Coach. You gotta start me, and let me play Monte. I want Monte, straight up. You want Monte. Jesus Christ. What kind of fucking balls do you have, man? The whole goddamn year all you wanted was to sit on your goddamn lazy ass and just get by, and now... ...fucking now, I'm supposed to believe that you can work hard enough to cover Monte? Oh, man. Look, I feel really badly about them showing that tape at the game, live here. But who the fuck do you think you're looking at, man? I'm not gonna blow a championship game just to give you a chance that you haven't come anywhere near deserving. It's not just my chance. It's the team's chance. Face facts. We don't have a prayer throwing one guy after another on Monte. We need somebody to knock him off his rhythm. Who better than somebody who's done it before? You saw that schoolyard D. I swatted his shit. I did it before, and I can do it again. Man, your work ethic... ...you'll probably walk off the court as soon as you spot the first decent piece of ass in the stands. Do I sound like the man who didn't work? Do I even resemble that person right now? I'll give you this: You've shown me more intensity in the last two minutes than you have the whole damn year. You know I'm our only hope against Monte. [dramatic hit ♪] [dramatic hit ♪] [crowd cheering] It's certainly a pleasure to be with you on such a happy occasion. It's also my pleasure and my honor to present the Most Productive Citizen award to the honorary captain of the St. Joe's basketball team, our own... Father Edward Donahue. [cheering] [band starts ♪] [band cuts] It brings me great joy to be acknowledged for my accomplishments. Thank you. And go Red Wave! [crowd erupts] [Kenny] The excitement in the air is beyond electrifying as we await the start of tonight's game. [air horn bleet] The St. Joe's fans realize that, win or lose, this is a once in a lifetime experience and they plan to make the most of it. Yeah! Yeah! Woohoo! Whoo! [stadium announcer] Starting for the Miami State Lightning at guard, a junior from Baltimore, Maryland, number 25, Steven Woods. Starting for the St. Joe's Red Wave, at guard, a sophomore from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, number 13, Anthony Tompkins. [Batt] Well this should be an interesting match up. The strong, aggressive Woods versus the scrappy Tompkins. [Kenny] And Woods certainly has the size advantage over Tompkins, but Tompkins is a deceptively talented athlete. [stadium announcer] ... a senior from Brooklyn, New York, number 21, Montgomery Clarke. [fans boo] [announcer continues] Starting for the St. Joe's Red Wave at forward, a senior from Brooklyn, New York, number 18, Harrison Williams. [Montgomery] Well, I'll be damned. [Harrison] Uh huh. [Kenny] Adler starts Williams against Clarke? What can Adler possibly have up his sleeve? I don't know. I guess we're gonna find out. What are you, nuts, Adler? Why are you startin' that scrub? What you staring at? Turn around before I throw you a beatin'. [horn buzzing] Alright, Harrison starting changes nothing about our game plan. He's just the first guy in on the rotation against Montgomery. Now remember, we have to shorten the game, with our disciplined offense, and our tough, in-your-face, defense. We gotta break our asses against those big motherfuckers. If you're gonna foul, foul fucking hard. And if you're not guarding Montgomery, look to rotate over and help out. And remember, no trash talking at Montgomery Clarke. You can't take away my weapons, Coach. You gotta let me do it my way. I'll tell you what, Mr. Big Shot, do whatever the fuck you want because as soon as it goes bad your ass is on the bench to stay. Now, come on, gentlemen. This is it. Hands in. - One, two, three. - Red Wave! Batt, what does St. Joe's need to do in order to beat the very talented Miami State Lightning. [Batt] Well, for starters, I just hope they did a lot praying. [Kenny] Well, I guess that couldn't hurt. [spits] [crowd noises] [hand slaps] [air horn bleet] So ironic... ...you're the sacrificial lamb. It's not gonna work on me, bro. I didn't get recruited by mighty Miami. They don't teach us big words like that here in Greenlawn. [under breath] Stupid motherfucker. [crowd noise softens] [tense chord sustains ♪] [slow motion] Let's go, St. Joe's! [bass note ♪] [clapping] [whoosh] [grunt] [thud] [crowd cheering] [Kenny] And we're under way! Woods brings the ball up, as Miami passes it around the perimeter. [squeaking shoes] [bouncing ball] They find Clarke, wide open on the baseline. [swish] And a superb scoring touch demonstrated by Montgomery Clarke. He'll have to challenge him more than that. He'll make that shot nine out of ten times. You know that's my range. You better play me out there. Harrison, play him tight up top. You got help. Looks like you're gonna need some help. [air horn] [Kenny] Woods blankets Tompkins as he brings it up court. Tough D. I think its important, Batt, for St. Joe's, psychologically, to get a good shot here on their first possession. [Batt] Yeah, that's exactly right. Boy, St. Joe's is running a very complicated motion offense. Certainly a far cry from the running type offenses Adler used with his very talented teams at Kentucky. [grunt] [swish] [cheers erupt] [Kenny] Beautiful sequence for the Red Wave, working hard to find an open shot for Ice Davis. [Batt] And Adler's got to feel good about that. [Kenny] Miami State heads back up court on offense, and they spread the floor. White passes to Woods. Gets it over to Johnson. Johnson, once again, finds Clarke at the same spot on the baseline, guarded by Williams. Sure that's close enough? [shoe squeak] [Kenny] Uh oh, here he goes! [dramatic music ♪] [whap] [whap] [grunt] [whap] [crowd erupts] [Kenny] Oh, my! From out of nowhere! Harrison Williams came over and made a huge statement, rejecting his high profile, ex-high school teammate's shot. [fans hooting] Not in my house, motherfucker. Take that to your mother! In your face! In your face! [Kenny] Miami State inbounds to Panama Johnson, and he throws up a brick! [Batt] That can't be the shot Coach Skinner wanted. [Kenny] Very upset on the bench. St. Joe's, back up court, into their pick and move offense, once again. You know, Batt, it's certainly too early to tell whether St. Joe's will be able to give the Lightning a real fight, but I'll tell you what, St. Joe's does not seem the least bit intimidated by Miami State. [slow whoosh] [dramatic clunk] [thud] [crowd erupts] [Kenny] Oh, my! It's Rose and Williams once again! This time, cutting back door for the slam dunk, and St. Joe's takes an unexpected, early lead. [Batt] The Miami State players look a little stunned right now. [Kenny] And after settling for two outside shots so far, I think you can look for them to take it inside, and assert themselves against a smaller St. Joe's team. And a strong move to the hoop! [thud] Oof. [whistle blows] Oh, a very aggressive foul by two Red Wave players, Wilford and Williams. It sure looks like St. Joe's is out here tonight to play for keeps. That's how you want the game to go, punk? Alright, we'll play that game with you. Oh, it's on, partnah. I'm bringing the noise, the ruckus, the funk... - I'm bringing it all, so you be ready. - Alright, whatever. [Kenny] Oh, look at those two jawing at each other again. This is not shaping up to be the game we expected, ladies and gentlemen. Hold on tight, these two teams look ready to slug it out all night. [funk music playing ♪] [Kenny] Here they come, it's a two on one break... ...and Montgomery Clarke slams it home! But the Red Wave still lead by three. [music continues ♪] [crowd cheering] [loud grunt] [Kenny] And it's Harrison Williams with the follow! [announcers, players, crowd voices overlapping] [Kenny] ...the Lightning know the Red Wave lead by nine. [funk music continues ♪] [Kenny] Oh, my! The Red Wave seem... Way to help out. Good foul! [horn section crash ♪] [piano and drums ♪] [rising whoosh] [Kenny] It's Harrison Williams, nailing the corner jumper! And St. Joe's lead is back to five. Fierce rebound. Look at those elbows fly! [Batt] Tough full court D by St. Joe's. They're not giving the Lightning an inch. [Kenny] And Harrison Williams ties up Montgomery Clarke... [whistle blowing] ...for a jump ball. Yet another great play by Harrison Williams. [♪] [Kenny] John "the Terminator" Wilford muscles his way inside. It's now 31-26, St. Joe's. [thump] [thud] [Kenny] Oh, fantastic effort to try and save it by Harrison Williams, who is playing like a man possessed, tonight. Yes! Work for me, baby! Oh, look, Fred! There's Suzie! God, I want that ass. [slap] I'm working. [funk music playing ♪] [Kenny] The St. Joe's movement is so pronounced now it almost looks like a weave drill. They kick it out to Harrison Williams... ... and he hits the open jump shot! [Batt] Boy, this is shaping up to be one of the best finals in years! [Kenny] St. Joe's has numbers on the fast break. Come on, come on. [Kenny] And the blown layup is followed by Harrison Williams! Yes, yes, yes! [grunt] [Kenny] Rare inside bucket for the Lightning, and it's 35-30. St. Joe's fast break is finished by the center, Jim Shaughnessy, and the Red Wave lead is back up to seven. Right there, right there. [Kenny] Oh, the Red Wave really making Miami State earn that bucket. Gorgeous passing sequence by the Red Wave. Go, Red Wave! Go, Red Wave! [Kenny] Montgomery fires from the outside... [swish] ...nearly ripping the net in two. Taylor, driving right through the heart of the Miami State defense for the score! [crowd cheering] [Kenny] That's the end of this very surprising and very entertaining first half of championship basketball, with the upstart St. Joe's Red Wave leading the Miami State Lightning by the score of 41-34. Where are you going? To the bathroom. What are you talking about? Well, dear, I really have to go. Do you want to be in the bathroom while our daughter dances on national television? [scoffs] Of course, you're right. I lost my head. How could I think of missing our Suzie? I can always go after her big number. This is a very dangerous halftime. You know why it's dangerous? Because you guys played a perfect half. But I wouldn't get too proud of yourselves, you know why? Because people don't remember teams that played perfect halves in championship games. They only seem to remember teams that have won... ...the fucking championships. And we're only up seven points. What do you think Miami would be up if they played a perfect half? Bet your ass, it'd be more than seven points. Be more like forty fuckin' seven. I hate to shock you... ...but we have another half to play. We're gonna stay focused. We're gonna be smart and patient on offense. We're gonna rotate on defense, and never allow anything easy. You guys keep doing what you're doing, and we are 20 minutes away from history. Oh, and, Harrison... ...I was wrong. You can trash talk that motherfucker 'til he cries. [laughter] Alright, everybody in. Come on! [stadium announcer] ...halftime aerobics team... One, two, three! Red Wave! [hooting, cheering] Well, we're just about ready to start the second half of our championship game. It was certainly an exciting first half, as the Cinderella, St. Joe's Red Wave, attempt to complete the final chapter of their fairy tale season. And St. Joe's game plan, Batt, has proven to be brilliant, and their execution, nothing short of perfection. Hey, Kenny Albert! I'm gonna come down there after the game and make you my boy toy! [psychotic laughter] Asshole! God, what an obnoxious woman. - Hi. - Hi. David Swinn, Flash Models. - And you are...? - Suzie Wilson. Ah. So, tell me, babe. Have you ever done any acting or modeling? - Well, nothing really, yet. - No? But I'm going to after graduation. I'm moving to New York. Oh, good for you. You have any representation? You mean like an agent? Yeah, what else? Not yet. One of these your bags? That one. You ever want to talk about representation after you graduate, you give me a call. My office is on Madison and 53rd, okay? - Okay? - Okay. Keep smiling. Bye. [Kenny] As the teams assemble on the floor, the mood seems very different than it was when the game started. [Batt] Yep, the St. Joe's players are really carrying themselves as Miami State's equals, now. I looked up the meaning of sacrificial lamb at halftime... ...I think you misusing the reference. [Kenny] The Lightning inbound the ball to begin the second half. And it's Montgomery breaking free to the hoop. [whoosh] [grunt] Reference that. [Batt] Ooh, big alley-oop dunk by Montgomery Clarke, and that's gotta send a shiver down Adler's spine. [Kenny] And Tompkins looks to settle St. Joe's down as he sets the offense. St. Joe's keeps the ball on the perimeter. And some really aggressive defense from Miami State, here. The Red Wave seem a bit flustered. [indistinct trash talk] [Kenny] Boy, Miami State is relentless. And it seems they've finally gotten their wake-up call. St. Joe's continues to work it around. And the steal by the Lightning, caused by that swarming defense. [Batt] Very aggressive defense. [Kenny] And now the Lightning march up court on offense. The ball goes into the post. Back out to the perimeter. [Adler] Nothing easy, come on! Nothing easy! [Kenny] And they find Clarke, open in the corner [swish] [Batt] Uh oh, this could be the beginning of one of those famous Lightning runs. When they get started, there's no stopping them. [Kenny] St. Joe's, once again, looks tentative on offense. Adler screaming at his players to come to the ball. Will you help out? Come on, help him out! Ref, timeout! [whistle blows] Christ... And Adler calls a much needed St. Joe's timeout. Boy, the Red Wave really having trouble getting started here, in the second half. Gentlemen... Am I the only guy with eyes on this fucking team? Can you not see that they're not in a man-to-man anymore? They fell into a zone trap. Here's what we're gonna do. We'll have Tim flashing in the middle. Ice and Harrison on the wings. When Tim gets the ball from the front, the two wingmen will cut to the basket. Hopefully, we'll get a cheap hoop, and those morons will go back and play man-to-man. Now get back out there, and don't embarrass me. Hands in. One, two, three. Red Wave! Come on! St. Joe's, Batt, seems to be having problems running its offense, which was so effective in the first half. [Batt] Well, what's happening is that Miami State is throwing a zone defense at them, and it's really giving St. Joe's a lot of trouble right now. Well, let's see if Adler has an answer for the tough, second half defense of the Lightning, here. [whistle blows] [dramatic chord sustain ♪] [Kenny] Here's the double team. St. Joe's keeps it on the outside. Here comes Davis! [rising whoosh] [slam] [thud] [crowd cheers] [celebratory grunt] [Kenny] There's your answer. Yeah! In your face! [funk music playing ♪] [Kenny] Davis nails another for three! St. Joe's, back up by four. [crowd boos] [Kenny] St. Joe's comes back on a fast break... ...they go up by four. [Kenny] The St. Joe's shot is missed, and the rebound gathered in by Montgomery Clarke. St. Joe's goes inside... ...now the follow... ...and the Miami State center sweeps the boards with authority! The Lightning steal the ball, and go in for the slam dunk. Miami trail St. Joe's by only three. Give some fucking help! [Kenny] An uncharacteristically quick shot... - Time out! - ... by the Red Wave. Time out, time out! [whistle blows] Do you happen to recall anything I might have said about some keys to winning? Nothing but dunks, or fucking layups... [Adler's voice overlaps itself] Does that ring a goddamn bell? From now on, I'm going to allow three pointers. ...inspire me to change... ...I'm gonna sit your fucking ass on the fucking bench for the rest of the fucking game. [horn section ♪] [Kenny] The perimeter jumper is... [whoosh] ...good! And St. Joe's leads by three. Oh, pretty follow by Larry White. Tompkins, into the front court... ...he drives the lane. [whistle blows] Oh, a tough foul as he gets drilled. [Batt] I think Adler is reminding Tompkins to pay the premium on his health insurance. [Kenny] Oh, nifty reverse layup by Davis. St. Joe's leads by four. White shoots, and hits... ...bringing Miami State within three. Clarke, who's playing true to his form here in the second half, shoots... ...bullseye! And the Lightning close to within one. [Blatt] Uh oh, St. Joe's has finally lost the cushion they've played with throughout much of this game. [Kenny] And Montgomery Clarke has dominated here in the second half. [Batt] Yeah, it's really nail-biting time here in Greenlawn, now. If St. Joe's doesn't score, Montgomery and the Lightning have the opportunity to take the lead for the first time in this game. [Kenny] St. Joe's working it around very tentatively on offense... [Batt] You get the sense they really feel the pressure. [crowd noises] [Kenny] And the shot is... [thunk] ... no good! [crowd aahs] - Shit. - It's finally corralled... ...by Miami State. Miami State coming up court with a chance to take the lead. Montgomery Clarke driving, and he slams it home, with just over a minute remaining. Dammit. [Kenny] The Lightning take the lead for the first time since early in the first half. [Batt] Let me say it one more time: Uh oh. [Kenny] St. Joe's brings it up court with just under one minute to play, and they're in desperate need of a basket, now, or it could all slip away. [Batt] Yep, this seems like a real do-or-die possession for the Red Wave. [Kenny] And the St. Joe's shot is... [thunk] ...off the rim! - The rebound is grabbed by the Lightning! - Oh! [Batt] And the dreams of the Cinderella Red Wave faithful seem to be fading fast. [Kenny] The Red Wave, in real trouble here. Get outta here! The Lightning continue to run time off the clock. They lead by one with only 20 seconds left in the game. 14 seconds on the shot clock, so they can't run it out. - Good D! [crowd chanting] - Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense! [clap clap] Call a timeout after the rebound! [crowd chant continues] [Kenny] Clarke takes the eight footer... ...he misses! Rebounded by Harrison Williams. [noises of crowd support] Time out, time out! [whistle blows] [Kenny] St. Joe's calls timeout. They trail Miami State by only one, 74-73, with three seconds remaining. Montgomery Clarke had the chance to extend Miami State's lead to three, but he blew the easy jumper, and St. Joe's can actually win it with a basket. Alright. Three seconds left. It's ours to win. Listen... We've been running these fucking guys around all night long, and we're gonna do it for three more fuckin' seconds. Let's run Blue 18. Ice, you're the decoy. Harrison, you're the shooter. You've gotten us this far tonight, now take us home, baby. Let's go. Come on everybody, hands in. Let's go, baby. Let's go! One, two, three! Red Wave! [air horns bleeting] [Kenny] It will certainly be interesting to see whose number Adler called to take the final shot. [Batt] The logical choice, I think, would be St. Joe's best scorer, Ice Davis, whose had another excellent game tonight, but if Davis can't get a good look, then someone else will have to step up for the Red Wave. [Kenny] Harrison Williams could be a candidate. He's got 23 points tonight. St. Joe's lines up in a stack. [grunting] They're muscling up intensely for position. [dramatic tone ♪] [slam] [whoosh sound] [dissonant creaking] [pom poms rustling] [fabric flapping] [click] [dramatic percussion hit] [ethereal screaming sound] [dramatic tone] [dramatic percussion hit] [pow] [slow-motion vocalization] [Kenny] Now the stack breaks... ...Ice Davis runs free to the corner... Shaughnessy with the pump fake to Davis. He throws it cross court... ... to a wide open Harrison Williams. Williams squares.... [dramatic percussion hit] He's got the shot lined up... [rising whoosh] [dramatic percussion hit] [high pitched tone] ... and the shot by Williams is... [boom] [pop] [glass shatters] [dull thud] [clunk] [clinking glass] [crowd screaming] [thunk] [indistinct yelling] [rapid footsteps] [thud] [grunt] [screaming continues] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God... Fred... What's happening? I don't know. Do you think our Suzie's alright? Who? [stadium announcer] Please, remain calm while we deal with this unfortunate situation. [Kenny] It's not clear what's going on. The ball and backboard both exploded suddenly. There's a commotion in both balconies. [Moron Boy] No! [indistinct vocalizations] Get off of me! I got you! You're nothing! I got you! [crying] Somebody help her, please. [hysterical stammering] [stadium announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm. The situation is under control. Please, please remain calm while we deal with this unfortunate situation. Please, remain seated. [sigh] [Kenny] W-we'll be right back. We'll try and sort out this unfortunate incident. Let me ask you a question. Are we just gonna stand around here holding our dicks, or can we repair the fiberglass in the backboard and finish the fucking national championship? A woman was just shot before our eyes. Do you know, on the day of the 1981 championship game, President Ronald Reagan and his Press Secretary, James Brady, were shot on national television? And they played the game that night. They played the game on the same day that two very, very important people were gunned down. Now, with all due respect, this woman was not the President of the United States, or its Press Secretary, but she was a very loud and obnoxious person who was giving everyone in this gymnasium a migraine. You ain't kidding. And the game in '81 hadn't even started before the President was shot. Now, here we've already invested 39 minutes and 57 seconds of a 40 minute contest. Now, really, given that perspective, don't you think it's appropriate that we finish the fucking game? [crowd cheering] [dramatic music playing ♪] [whistle blows] We will place three seconds on the game clock [heavy chime ♪] Alright you guys, listen very closely. I'm gonna give you a little lesson about luck. Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good. Milford... ...was that woman, who just took a bullet to the head, lucky? No. That's right. Yeah, the woman who just got shot in the head was not lucky. Hey, Davis... ...were the cheerleaders lucky when they suffered lacerations on their faces and bodies? No. That's right. The sliced up cheerleaders were not lucky. [sniff] Harrison... ...were you lucky when your shot... ...was blown out of midair? You bet your sweet ass you were fucking lucky! Because that shot had no chance of going in! You know why? Because you choked up, man. And you had no followthrough. That ball had no rotation, and had no fucking chance in hell of going in. So you were damn fucking lucky that your shot was blown out of midair. In fact, it was a fucking miracle. And all you cats go to a Catholic school, so you should know how precious... ...miracles are. And if you are fortunate enough to be graced by a miracle... ...you should fucking embrace it! Not fucking waste it. That piece of shit shot being gunned down was a fucking miracle! [up-tempo gospel playing ♪] So don't waste the fucking miracle! Alright, we're gonna line up... ...in the same formation. And they're gonna think it's a fucking decoy because we would never run the same play twice, but, we are. Blue 18. Ice, you are the decoy. And Mr. Harrison, you are the shooter. And follow through this time. Do us a favor. Alright, hands in! One, two, three! [in unison] Red Wave! ...yes, thank you. They're taking her to St. Vincent's Hospital. Get your coat, and let's go. Come on. Come on, I want to be waiting when she gets there. My God... ...baby, my baby! Just sit down, there's only three seconds left. You monster! That could be three seconds that our baby is living this tragedy without us by her side. [aggressively] Sit down, and shut up until the game is over! [whistle blows] [Kenny] After what has to be one of the most bizarre incidents in college basketball history, we're about to finish the championship game... ...again! St. Joe's breaks out of the stack it looks to be the exact same play! Harrison takes the inbounds pass... ...squares to shoot... [dramatic percussion ♪] [drum hit] [swoosh] [crowd erupts] [Kenny] It's all over! It's all over! The Cinderella story is finally complete! In what has to be the most incredible finish... [indistinct celebratory sounds] [raucous cheering] [player] We're number one! We're number one!... Ye-e-es! Yes! [melodic vocal celebration] [Helen sobbing] [Fred vocalizing joyously] [Fred laughs] Oh, God! [Helen shrieks] [Fred continues] [flash bulb poof] [reporters, calling] - Harrison! Harrison! - Harrison, over here! [male reporter] When was it decided you would start against your old teammate? I can't give away all the coach's secrets now, can I? [laughter] All I can really say is... ...I thank God he came up with the idea... ...and that he had faith in me... [camera click] ...that I had faith in myself. [poof] God gives each one of us a calling. [camera clicks] And I'm just glad that... ...mine led to the apprehension of a criminal. [camera click] [poof] [male reporter] Coach! What's the most satisfying thing about the win tonight, Coach? Oh, the accomplishment of the kids, come on. They came so far, and they, uh... ...proved they had the stamina, huh. Oh, and man, it was so beautiful to see Harrison come of age tonight. That was really beautiful. [camera clicks] [female reporter] Coach! Now that you've won a championship, especially in such a dramatic fashion, do you think it will affect you, as a person, in any way? I mean, do you think the experience changed you? [camera clicking] [sharp inhale] [sigh] [poof] [click] Okay... ...I think you had coffee, regular... ...and a very large glass of orange juice, madame. Thank you. Our pleasure.
