star in Hollywood you'd have to be insane to walk away from that no amount of money is worth living under a microscope it's not as easy as that Rick we've got hundreds of people in this studio actors directors technicians they count on Rick stone pictures for a living the studio made money before I came along don't worry Ross you'll find another golden boy wait a minute Rick I'm beginning to see

mistress and with all the nudity and groping well I don't know Jake you're the expert leave something like this would get ratings give me that video I don't believe this nothing but the most incredible video I've ever seen nobody had nobody has this type of us we can we can hook this thing for weeks we're get we're can I get the biggest right he's at history you my darling husband out

it's that celebrity news show American Expo say I don't want that bad boy John we'll watch this everyone knows Rick stone is America's hottest action hero but as this macho act you're about to become Hollywood's newest sex star it sure seems that way and here's the proof our camera recorded this exclusive footage of Rick with his latest leading lady Stephanie Roberts but this isn't a scene from Rick's new movie lethal assault this is our private home video of Rick and Stephanie in the dining room with her Hollywood love nest but wait if Stephanie misses Rick stone we're afraid not looks like a trick stones case one woman just isn't enough sorry Michelle you know I always thought that red where's your color darling nothing to say there I personally thought it was one of you more convincing I'll sue those bastards I don't believe this shit well you can believe this darling I've already spoken with my lawyer and under normal circumstances I might get half of everything but after your little striptease show just be glad if I did you keep those little right shorts nice high coming back for seconds did you see it see what Rick what are you talking about there was a gentleman outside your window today when I was there they found us it was on fucking TV wait a second I was on TV with you naked oh my god wait Michelle sighs she taped it I haven't done a TV interview in five years now this show just camped outside your window and shoot six tons first porno do you know what this means I haven't even announced my retirement yet people are going to think I'm being forced out of the business because of this calm down Rick don't do anything to be sorry for me oh you think I can be any sorrier than this Michelle's already contacted a lawyer she wants every damn dime everything I've ever made look I'll call you later right now I've got some business to take care of Rick Rick talk to me Rick I promised you guys a follow-up story I just didn't think it was gonna be this soon yeah well I think Rick has a beautiful co-star and just tell me you got all that on tape every second hurry this is gonna be huge oh yes and we owe it all to mr. stone good luck huh motherfucking crib this is just right first that bitch puts me on our fucking TV show that damn jail Stephanie Stephanie I'll be here mr. stone mr. stone do you find himself any other reporters today well well well what an attractive couple aren't you going to introduce me Rick I barely recognize your little friend here all her clothes on just get out of my way Michelle I don't have time for this well you better make the time Rick and you dear I hope you have a nice little waitressing job lined up I mean after our divorce Rick won't exactly be flush you can have the money Michelle I just want you out of my life you'll have to excuse me I forgot to introduce my attorney Rick this is Bruce Kessler pleased to meet you mr. stone and I'm sure that the two of you are gonna make very good friends let's just go rip these cameras you're filming everything she's right Rick you should listen to her at 20 million she's gonna become the most expensive piece of ass in history that does it I'm canceling the release of lethal assault the Frick stone hands this way this studio is going to be that against joking Hollywood do do you really think that that's the right thing to do I mean good or bad Rick is generating millions of dollars of free publicity if it was my decision I'd open the picture next week next week absolutely take advantage of all this public interest in Rick stone I mean have you seen the ratings Rick story on American expose last night had the highest ratings for that show ever right now people are glued to their sets watching him attack that reporter and now this hey I admit that Rick is out of control but isn't that what people want to see America's biggest action hero on a complete rampage so what do you think can the movie be ready by next week editing would have to work day and night but you sure about this I have never been more sure of anything look Rick said he's retiring this may be your last chance to cash in on a Rick stone picture and besides maybe between now and the premiere we might really get lucky what do you mean can you imagine the publicity if Rick stone or to kill someone mmm-hmm everyone saw how he tried to attack me today yeah it was up every new show in the country mm-hmm this house is as good as mine and all the money rick has been a very successful star for the past five years and now I'm going to be a very rich one all right okay okay Bruce all right I'll see you tomorrow at the office thank you good night thanks fine Rick Rick I hope you're not so stupid to come back here you know bruises issued a restraining order against you today you'd be insane to come back and try to do anything to me you got that Rick thank you just my imagination what are you doing here surprise me my surprise oh I'm not complaining huh the TV right now who is this hello so who was that I don't know they didn't say just that I should turn on the news now for what to see that fight outside the jail again they've been showing that all day I don't think they're talking about that how do you know you don't even know who it was it was probably that bitch with the TV show you know what's after 11:00 that she is not even on now Stephanie can we just forget this I'm not going to let those reporters control our lives I doesn't take a quick look it'll only take a second Stephanie no I won't be able to sleep till I know what it is the body of Michelle stone wife a film star Rick stone was discovered in her Beverly Hills mansion this evening police investigated after a neighbor heard gunshots near their 2 million-dollar mansion upon entering police discovered her body an apparent shooting victim police are now searching for Rick stone for questioning but do not admit to whether he is a suspect in his wife's murder I don't believe this she's dead she's really dead it means we can keep all the money somebody just made our life a lot easier somebody Brooke you just came over a half hour ago when you talked to the police they're gonna want to know where you were on the night I was right here with you if they asked that's what you'll tell them right of course that's what you want that's exactly what I want no but we both know that you weren't here all night so we're leaving where was I Stephanie do you think I had anything to do with that I mean I am I hate her I admit it but no I didn't kill her so where were you I was driving around just thinking things out just just driving yeah I understand but that's not the sort of thing the police are going to want to hear they will want a second-by-second breakdown of every stop I made every Street I drove down that's why it's better for both of us if we just stick to our little story agreed that's what you want I just want us to be together like you said somebody just made my life a whole lot easier and a lot richer that's my girl it's that bitch what Dana field that should have known she would be there I'm here with the woman who's been in the center of the Rick stone story Dana fields from TVs favorite tabloid show American expose American expose is not a tabloid show we just have all the stories everyone else which is the head first don't believe that bitch can we assume that you here to film another story on on Rick well you can just tune in tomorrow and find out that's when I'm gonna reveal the name of Michelle stones real killer do you really think she knows who murdered your wife of course not but it's obvious what she's planning to do what's that she's flying on that show tomorrow and say that I killed Michelle like why would she do that what are these assholes on TV do anything for ratings if she can convince the country that I killed Michelle she'll have a TV event of the year and best of all she think she'll be able to destroy me in the process maybe you should call the police right now tell them you had nothing to do with Michelle's oh I'll call the police all right to report another murder Dana feels Rick promise me you won't if that bitch wants to take me down she's coming along for the ride Benefield will not do that show tomorrow that's a problem so how do we view tonight footage we got to give us the whole show - oh and we can replay all the other footage - Rick stones afternoon delight with blonde mistress Rick stones strangling via four reporter oh and let us not forget Rick star the Saltine frightened away only hours before they find a blood-stained corpse in their Beverly Hills mansion you should be a woman to pay better than this honey Rick stones gardener makes more than you do okay you're not okay but when CBS offers you Connie Chung shot just promise you won't forget me yeah daddy Adam Adam come on dude we gotta get this tape down to the station going somewhere Let Go with me what'd you do to Adam Hipp be alright I just put a bump on his head but a hell of a lot worse it's gonna happen to you if you don't behave now is that his camera yeah alright get the tape out of it and give it to me now you know I think this is some of Adams best work oh I hope that doesn't spoil your little TV show for tomorrow night the one where you planned to announce my wife's killer that show will be on tomorrow night with or without that tape yeah well I know one thing for sure it'll have to go on without you what what do you mean what I mean is that you and I are going to make our own little video you're going to admit that you provoked that little fight at that station and you're going to tell those 20 million viewers of yours that I had absolutely nothing to do with Michelle's death I don't know that it's the truth Stephanie can verify that I was at her house all night I guess that changes your little announcement doesn't it my announcement yeah you were going on TV tomorrow and say that I killed Michelle weren't you you thought you had it all figured out I didn't know what I was gonna say that was just bait to get people to watch the show I thought yeah what did you think I thought maybe the police would charge you with something tomorrow I mean come on who stands to benefit more from Michelle's death than you she was ready to divorce you and see you for everything you're worth not anymore not anymore I know you people are working day and night to get this new Rick stone movie finished but I think it'll be worth it you know the public can't seem to get enough for brick and we're the studio in his new movie Ross can I speak to you for a minute sure what is it excuse me do you remember yesterday when I said only one thing would make the debut of lethal assault any bigger I remember you said the way the press is eating Rick alive may actually help the picture that's why I've got everyone busting their ass to get this movie ready on time and I said the only way lethal assault could possibly open any bigger would be the Rick killed somebody not that he isn't trying looks like he tried again with his wife you mean Michelle he tried to kill Michelle how is she she isn't let me show you something following the brutal murder of Michelle stone a Los Angeles police spokesman announced that Rick stone the victims film star husband is being sought for questioning regarding his wife's murder and an anonymous Department insider tells us that Rick stone is in fact the primary suspect in his wife's murder well I don't believe this he did it the son of a bitch actually killed his wife sure looks that way earlier yesterday stone was videotaped outside the LA County Jail as he attempted to assault his wife just hours before she was brutally slain in her Beverly Hills mansion so how many theaters will be playing lethal assault next week a little over a thousand better make that two thousand don't you think this is a little over the top would you be quiet I'm almost ready all right now I want you to look in the camera and say that I am NOT Michelle's murderer look you attacked my cameraman you tie me up and kidnap me and now you expect me to do your little private video I don't think so and I think we're not going anywhere until you look into this camera and tell all of those nice people that watch your piece-of-shit show that I am NOT Michelle's killer look even if I do this stupid little video of yours nobody's gonna believe me look at me they're gonna know you're forcing me to say it good try but I'm only shooting your face now are you ready for take one I just don't believe this okay okay all right so you're my director how would you like me to look would you like me to be happy oh look everybody I'm on TV oh this is just the most exciting thing that's ever happened I'd like to say hi to my mom and my brother Josh and oh let's not forget my little dog Lulu can we do this okay all right this is it okay I'm here to say that a terrible wrong has been done to one of Hollywood's brightest stars I'm talking about mr. Rick stone a very special man who has been accused of a terrible crime well folks I'm here tonight to tell you that mr. stone is absolutely 100% guilty the man's a maniac it he wants to kill me next Dana come back Dayna my god that truck killed me you saved my life like I said I'm not a murderer boy you ever appreciate a little something like blood circulation until you lose it you know this whole thing is just a big mistake you're welcome to go anytime you want I should probably turn myself in to the police now but you think whoever killed your wife is still out there I know they are don't you want to find out who did it hey this is just a movie prop I'm no detective yeah but I bet together we can both find out the truth behind this thing you and me working together I don't believe I'm hearing this excuse me aren't you the person that's been trying to ruin my life look I'll admit at first I thought you killed her but now I'm not so sure you killed your wife that's what I've been trying to tell you would you be willing to go out American expose with me tomorrow night if we can convince the public that you're innocent then we can demand that the police start looking for the real killer this isn't some kind of trick if we can convince them that somebody else killed your wife don't forget about all that other stuff and well you can have your life back okay I'm probably crazy but I'm going to trust you I'll go on that show with you tomorrow great I promise you won't be disappointed I've checked with all the media TV newspapers magazines we're going to have absolutely maximum publicity for the premiere Ross I know and with everyone convinced that Rick killed his wife I think we have the movie of the year on our hands we may have bad you know on one hand I hope Rick really didn't do it but if someone else did kill his wife I just hope to god they stay out of sight till after the premiere oh I'll talk to you soon drops bye-bye hello hi Julie that's what you're the last person I expected to hear from besides I thought she fired me not that it matters I'm working for Ross now look I know the police are looking for me I just wanted you and Ross to know that I had nothing to do with Michelle's death are you sure about that Rick I mean with her dad you can have the house and all the money and all this publicity isn't going to hurt the opening of your movie either I mean whatever you're up to it this is turning out to be the greatest publicity stunt in film history look just watch American expose tonight I'm telling the whole country that I am innocent that's not so smart Rick why don't you wait until after the premiere I mean as long as everyone thinks that you killed your life we have potentially the biggest movie of the year on our hands you know I ruin that do you wreck so that's what this is all about money you'd rather sit my ass in jail if you thought you could sell a few more tickets business is business you said this was your last movie well Ross and I just plan to make the most of it Julie bye bye sweetie we could have had a wreck Rick I'm sorry I was just rushing over here to see you do you know the police are looking for you have they been here already they called I had a promise that I'd like to know if I saw you well a good girl always keeps her word maybe I'm not a good thing I was worried about you last night Rick you said you to look for that reporter than on TV they said she was missing hey nothing happened all right I was just blowing off some steam Dana Fields is very much alive and well I don't think you saw after all she wants me to go on her show tonight so that I can say on TV that I'm innocent sounds like a trap Rick besides that show has already tried to ruin both of us I'm not gonna forget what they did to me half of this country has seen me naked and the other half probably wishes they had you think that's funny hey I'm sorry but listen I need you with me tonight for that interview you're my only alibi you can tell everyone that I was here with you all night you weren't here with me don't forget that Rick you weren't here with me all last night what are you trying to say that I killed Michelle after all this time you still don't trust me it's that it you have no right to talk to me like that I could have turned you in to the police by now then why don't you everyone else is trying to destroy me you might as well join them Rick look I'll be at the station if you change your mind has anyone seen mr. stove with one the air in 30 minutes Rick where hasn't been it's almost time are you sure this is a good idea do the police know I'm here no no this is very hush-hush you're gonna be a surprise guest I thought you were bringing Stephanie I told her about the show but she didn't go for it she she thinks it's some kind of a trap but you getting like one of the cameras and really ripped me apart all right all right anyway listen we go in the air in 20 minutes come on I've got to get you into makeup tonight an American expose exclusive Rick stone fights back since the shocking death of his wife mr. stone has been sought by Los Angeles police officers for questioning it has been said by police insiders that mr. stone himself is the focus of their investigation but amid all the speculation that he killed his wife mr. stone is here with us this evening to make a rare television appearance to tell us his side of this tragic story Rick welcome to American expose thank you I understand you have something that you'd like to say to our viewers yes that's right I realized that a lot of people may have formed an opinion about me that they're convinced that I had something to do with my wife's death I just want to say to everyone that I know I wasn't the perfect husband but I did not kill my wife what does he think he's doing he's lying Rick is there anyone out there that can verify your innocence anyone at all that can say where you were at the time of your wife's death yes there is Stephanie Roberts was with me for the entire evening of my wife's death I only left Stephanie's house after I heard about Michelle's murder I would urge the Los Angeles police to ask Stephanie about my whereabouts that evening and then go out and look for my wife's real killer so what's the verdict Oh see Thank You Julie I hope of Rick you're not gonna believe this our switchboards are flooded with calls and they're all overwhelmingly in your favor you mean it worked yes they believed you I didn't see it with my own eyes I wouldn't believe it maybe now the police will start looking for the real killer I'm sure they will hey I've got a bottle of champagne in my dressing room miRNA celebrate you're not afraid to be alone with me I mean listen I'm a wanted man yeah I think I'll be all right come on do you think anyone's gonna believe him I told him not to do anything until after the premiere yeah well since when does Rick stone take other people's advice so what do you think could you really be innocent you know Rick as well as I do Ross if anybody's capable of murder he is Wow I guess this must be one of the first we have intended to start a reporter yeah don't forget which story made you start a reporter you know open up one of these things yeah let me help you out did I ever apologize for that little scuffle we had oh you mean this little scuffle well I guess I wasn't being the nicest person in the world either hey you know Adam comes back to work tomorrow he might want to thank you for his little paid vacation mm-hmm yeah I guess I have been kind of an asshole yeah I guess you have but if you can get that bottle open for me I just might be willing to forgive you folks oh yeah they sorry excuse me this is the studio where they film Eric expose isn't it is Rick stone still here thank you do the pay phone I can use hello police this is Stephanie Roberts I need to speak with the officer in charge of Michelle Stone's murder investigation delicious you'd be surprised some of the catering all those movie sets aren't so hot and my wife is never Suzie homemaker well what about Stephanie had that she was taking care of me I did too but you know I don't know she's been acting sort of strange lately we had a major blowout this afternoon somehow she still seems to think that I had something to do with my wife's murder I'm calling about Rick stones appearance on that TV show of American expose I want the police to know that Rick stone was not with me the entire evening of his wife's murder he was lying when he said I could verify that mr. stone arrived at my house a little before midnight and when I asked him where he'd been he became defensive and angry with me I just want the police to know the truth and if you're looking for mr. stone there's a good chance he's with Dana fields now we can just convince the police right now I can't believe I'm in bed with America's Most Wanted man there's nowhere I'd rather be hey how about a drink hmm room service I think I could get used to this I've got a couple beers is that okay Rick Rick Rick can you hear me sorry so he's good-looking he's famous you just hooked up with that Greg one where he could be where come on stop joking around Rick Rick this is not funny I am not in the mood to play hide and seek rank it's better be good raah stop whatever

Rick stone in connection with her shooting death police reportedly received information this evening that disputes stone's alibi that he was in the company of Stephanie Roberts at the time of the slaying a department insider has hinted that the new information may have even come from Roberts herself at the moment police have failed to apprehend Rick stone and they also say he may be believed to be armed and dangerous this is it we've got a warrant for the bastard let's just hope the police find him soon it's hard to feel safe with a killer loose on the streets I've come back to you Rick

retiring from the film business is this true I was considering retiring from Hollywood after this film but my producer Ross Jacobs and I talked it over and we feel that the events that have taken place in my life over the past couple of weeks would be a great subject for a new movie and you're of course talking about the very unfortunate murder of your beautiful wife and the fact that for a very short period of time you were considered the main suspect in her murder is that right yes and fortunately you are completely cleared of that as all your fans know is there anything else that you might like to add before we go just one thing my new movie will have a special dedication it's for someone that's very important to me that won't be able to see it for someone that's missed very much for Dana you
