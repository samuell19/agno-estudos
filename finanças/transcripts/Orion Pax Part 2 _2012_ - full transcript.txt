Previously on Transformers Prime... Optimus has reverted to his pre-Prime state: Orion Pax. The Key-card! What does it do? It grants access to Vector Sigma, an ancient source of mystical power. On Cybertron. When we stormed the Iacon Hall of Records in the waning days of the war for Cybertron, we acquired highly classified files which we were not able to decipher. It's 'Cons! And they're busting into the same military research lab they hit two months ago. We let them finish building their Space-bridge. - Why? - So we can commandeer it. And use it to send ME to Cybertron. I have not seen him aboard the ship. Commander Starscream is dead. Optimus Prime?! Please! I mean no harm! Oh! Then what are you doing here?! Research. For Lord Megatron. Is this some kind of joke? I... do not understand. And why did you call me "Optimus Prime"? Why wouldn't I? Because my name is Orion Pax. I am far from being a Prime. You reminded me of someone I once knew. That's all. You are Starscream. Yes... ? Lord Megatron told me you had been... terminated. Lord Megatron says many things only some of which are true. You... do not suggest that our leader would speak falsehoods? You truly are being kept in the dark, aren't you? Transcript by Skein correction by f1nc0 1080p by hkawabata 2x02 - Orion Pax, part 2 You speak in many riddles, Starscream. Please, tell me what it is that you know. And in return... Starscream! Surrender! Hold your fire! - Remain in the lab. - But I... Lord Megatron's orders. Rafael! Is the test subject ready? Check! Long-range GPS activated. I have doubts whether my recalibrations have successfully extended Ground-bridge range. But there's only one way to find out. Come on! It was just the first try... No, Rafael. It was pure folly. A misguided act of desperation. It takes eons to master Space-bridge engineering. And no one is more accomplished than the Decepticons... You know, there is this thing in gym class where you have to climb a rope. All the way to the ceiling. It's really hard. And I've never been able to do it. But... When I told Bee about it he believed in me. Which made me practice a ton. Finally, just a couple of weeks ago, I made it! To the top. What does any of this have to do with gym class?! I... I was just... I'll give you some alone time. Optimus... I am so sorry. Orion. I am so sorry for the recent commotion. You were not in any way harmed, were you? No, Lord Megatron. But why did you tell me Starscream was dead? Because he is dead to our Cause. Starscream was my most trusted lieutenant. Until he turned traitor and joined the Autobots. Never have I witnessed a more profound act of deceit. He did not do or say anything troubling to you? - No. - Good. Perhaps it is best to forget the entire incident and return to your project. As you wish, my Lord. Orion was never very adept at the art of deception. I made a mistake not terminating Starscream when I had the opportunity. A mistake I do not intend to make again! No sign of energon spikes. Arcee or Bee find the Space-bridge? They haven't yet reported back. - Ratchet. You alright? - Hm? Yes! Yes. Let's just get you to the next quadrant. What is it? A high-frequency signal. With an embedded message! ...for me. - Optimus? - Starscream. "I have obtained information regarding your Leader. Bring medical kit. Come alone". I told you to come alone! - And since when do we listen to YOU? - Where is Optimus? Patch me up and perhaps I'll tell you. Have sympathy. I'm leaking here! Then I suggest that you speak quickly! Has Optimus been harmed in any way?! He's fine. Fine! Can't you see I'm the one who's been harmed? Where is he?! Where do you think?! He's on Megatron's warship! Which is located WHERE? Ha... ha. Now, who knows? It's a ship! It moves. It took me months to track only to get fired upon. You wouldn't go to the trouble of calling me hereunless you had information to trade. Real information! Very well... Your beloved Leader may have lost his senses. He goes by the name "Orion Pax" now. And it seems Megatron has led him to believe he's a Decepticon. Tell us something we don't know. What?! How could you possibly know THAT?! We are wasting our time. Wait. That's all I have! Really! You can't just leave me like this! Unless you know where Megatron is hiding his Space-bridge, you can stay here and rust. Space-bridge... Do you mean to tell me that they actually finished building it without my supervision?! It hurts most right here, Doctor. The Decepticons' Space-bridge is located right here. Deep within an Energon mine. Adjacent to a raw fuel supply. Clever. What's our intel? A... reliable source. So! Do we have a consensus? Do we know if people can even breathe your atmosphere? I'll back Jack up. Completely, state of the art. I still have connections at NASA. It's too dangerous. Mom. I know that this is hard. But Optimus risked his life to save our planet. And he's not even human. We owe it to him. Jack may be the only one who can do this, June. But I don't want you to think for one moment that I'll allow him to travel unchaperoned. Not everyone is destined for an ordinary life. Optimus Prime was once Orion Pax, after all. When you were little, you always wanted to be an astronaut. Okay. "Optimus Prime". "Optimus Prime. Leader of the Autobot invaders." I reminded Starscream of him?.. And Lord Megatron said... Ratchet was the Autobot leader. ...Someone is not telling the truth. We will ground-bridge directly in to the energon mine and make our way to the Space-bridge chamber neutralizing any Decepticon forces we encounter. Once we secure the Space-bridge we'll send for Jack. Stealth must be an absolute priority. We will most certainly be outnumbered and if any Decepticon should transmit an alert to their warship... The odds become four hundred to one. Scrambling communications upon entry will certainly provide an edge in this regard. Taking the Bridge is the easy part. You three need to hold it long enough for Jack and me to get to Cybertron and back. Rafael climbed to the top of the rope in gym class ...we can do this. What does gym class has to do with anything? And if Ratchet gets to go on a commando raid, I'm going too. Miko. You will help Rafael operate our Ground-bridge and manage the communications hub. Can't go to Cybertron, can't storm the Decepticon Space-bridge!.. And nurse Darby will stand-by in case of emergency. Son? It's time to suit up. - Clear. - Clear. Command! This is Space-bridge control. We are under attack! Command! Do you... ? Going down. By the Allspark...! Thank you, Starscream. Who else would it be? - A masterpiece of engineering... - Operational? Fully. - Perimeter secured. - Now the scary part. I'm shutting down the scrambler in order to contact base and maintain communications through the remainder of the mission. Strike team to base. Objective secured. That's your cue. Bring me back a souvenir. Sooo... what happens when you have to go to the bathroom? Safe journey, son. Just... go already. Optimus needs you. Locking onto Cybertron. You ready? Let's do this. I'll leave the Space-bridge portal open in order to eliminate any communication lag over the great distance. And make it easier for you to locate when you're ready to return. Easier to locate? You're not bridging us straight to the Big V? Vector Sigma's true location is shrouded in myth and rumour, Jack. It is said that the path of the Primes leads there. We must be confident that Optimus will guide you. Don't worry. Space-bridging is just like Ground-bridging. Just a little more intense! I... I can't believe it! I am actually on another planet. Arcee, this is incredible! Arcee? This isn't how I wanted you to see my home. I'm... I'm sorry. In the fog of war it is hard to see beyond the next leg of the mission or the next punch in the fight. We did everything to save Cybertron. But when the fog finally lifted... There wasn't much left to save. Arcee! Jack! Do you copy? Roger. We're on Cybertron. - Yes! - Woo-hoo! Oh, thank goodness! Just keep the sightseeing to a minimum, huh. Indeed. We don't know if your journey ahead is 5 kliks or 5000. Understood. We're out. Okay. Ratchet said the Card would guide us, but... I don't see how or what I'm supposed to... There you go. This could be awhile. Space-Bridge Control, do you read me? Space-bridge control, this is Breakdown. Your status report is overdue. Scrap. Bulkhead, no! He'll recognize your voice. I can make it lower. Higher? He would recognize mine as well. Come in, Space-bridge Control! Don't make me come down and dent some engine blocks. Somebody say something, pronto! Rafael! Patch in Agent Fowler. You have one nanocycle to respond or!.. This is Space-bridge Control. Situation normal. Normal? You sure about that? We were just... calibrating the subsystems and we... had a surge, but it's fine now. How are you? Er, erm... Never better! I know it's thankless down there. Keep up the good work. Will do. Control out. Why would the Decepticon archive be so heavily encrypted? How could I possibly be "Optimus Prime"? Even our encryptions couldn't keep him from the truth! Orion has much to accomplish and he will stay the course! Even if I must inflict great pain to ensure the completion of project Iacon! That way. Toward Kaon? The Decepticon capital. Swell. We're on foot from here. Don't want engine noise to attract the wrong kind of attention. - 'Cons? - Vermin. This way. Transcript by Skein correction by f1nc0 1080p by hkawabata
