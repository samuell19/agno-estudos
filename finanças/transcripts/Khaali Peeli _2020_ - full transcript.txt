CENTRAL PRISON Got a light? -Yeah, I do. -Can I have it? What are you guys staring at? That's me. I'm the guy you root for. I mean, the hero! My life is like a spicy Bollywood movie. It'll eventually end right where it begins. There are two things I love about my life. First, is action. And the second, is emotion. -Hey, what are you doing? -Get in! Let's move! And that's my squeeze. I mean, the heroine. Every time she shows up... the emotion goes right out the window. Do you know what started this emotional wildfire? The bloody spark plug from my father's Bajaj scooter. What's wrong, brother? Can I help you? Please hold this, son. Be careful. Good boy. Hold it. Very good. The spark plug is jammed. Dubey, this world is going to the dogs. This kid should be doing his homework. But his father is making him steal. And as soon as we got there... he left his kid high and dry. The old man isn't the mastermind... his son is! What the hell is wrong with this? I can't leave my shop unprotected for two days! It won't be unprotected, boss. The height is just two feet! No one will be able to get through. And Badal Singh's here for you anyway. There's no problem. Don't worry, boss! I'll be here. Alright, so, it was your plan. You're an idiot but your father should have been more responsible, right? No way! We could be in jail for seven years if we're caught. "If we are caught!" I'll slip in there like a dab of butter on a hot pan! I'll get the moolah in two minutes and we'll scram! But where are we gonna sell all that gold? In Mumbai! You know Yusuf Bhai, right? He'll handle it. How did you deal with Badal Singh? He had a bloody rifle with him, right? What did you do to him? Badal Singh wasn't born with a rifle in his hand! He was born with a spanner. What? He was a mechanic when he was a child. So? So, what? The rifle is Badal Singh's wife. But the spark plug... is his first love. And if he meets his first love, right in the midst of his boring marriage... sparks are bound to fly, right? What did you say to your father after the robbery? Then, I said... Stop the car, moron! -Hey! -Stay back! -Go! -Get him! What the hell! Bloody goons! They're gone. People have a really short fuse these days. Give me a light. I need to leave this city. -Long Live! -Taxi Union! As you can see, Taxi Drivers' Union has organized a strike. They've been protesting for the past two days. The government hasn't taken cognizance of this strike. They've vowed to continue this strike until their demands are met. The citizens of Mumbai have been suffereing for the past two days because of this strike. The citizens are are not being able to commute to their schools and offices. But the taxi drivers are standing their ground. They'll continue to protest until their demands are met. I'm Nagesh Tiwari, with my cameraman, Deepak. Hey! Taxi! Stop! Please, stop! Jaslok! We need to get to Jaslok! Of course. Five thousand. Five thousand? It's just five minutes away! Why don't you take the bus? Hey! Can't you see it's an emergency? Hey! Can't you see we're on strike? Please, just let it be. Call for an ambulance. He won't, auntie! You're suffering out here. And he's thinking about saving money? Miser! Alright! Let's go! I'll pay you. Come on. Hey! Turn the music off! Come on, uncle! Your child is about to enter this world. It needs some badass background music for its entry, right? Why is he driving? We're supposed to be on strike! Let's check out who this hero is! Come on! Let's go! Hey! Stop! Hey! Nurse! Nurse! Be careful. Come on, man! Help her! Here's your five thousand. I'm coming. Hey, hero! I need to go to the taxi union office. Can you drop me off? We organize protests for you imbeciles! We get thrashed by the cops! We go to jail! And you? People like you ruin my reputation by ferrying people on the night of a strike! We can't let that happen. Can we? Come on! Speak up! Well, the thing is... I have a rule. When your left palm itches for money... never wash it off. Scratch it. Relish it. You're a funny man! Your left hand's really itchy, right? Let me help you. I'll get rid of it. And once I get rid of it, you can use your right hand to wipe your behind. Hey! Get him! The cops are impounding a taxi! Whose taxi is it? It's that scumbag's taxi. That's nice. Hey, stop! -Here's 500. -No, it's okay. Go on! Keep it! You'll need it. -Get an air-conditioner in here. -Thanks, bro. Thanks, homie! Hey! Are you crazy? Come on! Let's go! What are you waiting for? They're forcing me to get married. Yeah, and I am your flower girl. Five thousand. What? Pay up or you're free to leave. Yeah, I'll pay you. Move! Greedy scum! Look at that! There are two grooms looking for you! Ten thousand. Yeah, you can have it! Shut your filthy trap and move! -Hey! Where is she? -Holy mother of hell! The whole wedding party's looking for you! 15 thousand! Hey! Stop irritating me! If you don't get going, I'll be married and they'll be having their honeymoon with you and your taxi! Impossible! -Hey! There she is! -Get her! No one touches my baby but me! -Get the car! Let's go! -Get in! Get in! Fasten your seatbelt. Learn to drive, you bloody chump! Who the hell are you? Who were those guys? I can tell that you're not a bride. Brides aren't dress like tarts. What the hell have you done? Someone's getting hitched for the first time in this neighborhood. Usually, girls from this neighborhood get used and ditched. You're a really lucky girl! You're getting such a loving husband. You mother would've been really happy had she been alive. Hey! Come on! Come on, auntie! My mother is right here with me. Don't you dare forget your auntie! There you go! -Look at them dancing, boss! -Yeah! Why don't you go dance with your girl? -There you go! -Boss! -It looks like you've lost the queen. -Yes, boss. Come on, boss! There you go! -Damn it! Get me a cigarette, man! -We're out of cigarettes, boss. I'll get cigarettes for you, boss! -Shut up, man! Hey, handle him. -I'll get it for you! Bag? Pooja! Hey! Pooja's running away! Go get her! Oh, God! Where are we going? What? Where do I drop you off? VT Station. Hey! Dimwit! What do you think... these goons that you've cheated will be waiting for you at the altar? They'll looking for you all over Mumbai! Your posters must be all over VT, Mumbai Central and Dadar station. -Have you seen her? -Hey! Have you seen this girl? -Have you seen her? -Where is she? -Pretty posters plastered all over! -Hey! What do you mean by, "Hey"? What's the plan? Sehwag! What? There are just two kinds of plans! First is the Sachin plan. Shock the bowler by hitting an incredible four. Understand the bowling. Select your target and plan your moves. And when the time comes... And the second? The second is Sehwag! Grab everything you get! You don't give a damn! Go all guns blazing from ball one. Just go for it! Do you have a third plan? Like a Rahul Dravid plan? Safe? Of course. I'm leaving Bombay anyway. I could get you outside the city. Listen... I'll drop you off at a station outside the city. Just do the same thing you were gonna do at VT. Get on a train and disappear. Alright? Yeah! Great! No, it isn't! You'll have to pay me! Ten thousand! That makes it 25! Grab everything you can get, darling! I've been living the Sehwag plan all my life! We're looking. The boys are looking for her. We'll find the-- Look, Yusuf... I have made a mistake. I just had one job. And I couldn't do it either. What are we gonna say to Mr. Chowksi? How are we gonna tell him that Pooja ran away? The Pooja he's been waiting for, for the past ten years! You're right. I deserve to be punished. But... I know... you won't be able to do it. I might not be your real aunt... but you do love me, right? Hey, Yusuf! Forgive me, Yusuf! I won't be able to do it either. I would've killed you even if you were my aunt. What's your name? Ten thousand. The total was 25 thousand, right? I'll pay you 30! Why are you paying me more? To shut your filthy trap! Idiot. What are you staring at? Keep your eyes on the road! You're driving in a no-entry zone. Idiot! Is this your first time in Mumbai? Hey! The streets of Mumbai are in my veins. I've been slogging in these streets for the past ten years. Dad! Who is he? Vijay Chauhan. The goon? You're right, boss. But not just Kamathipura, I want Dedh Gali, Benaras Chawl, Mr. Bacchu's area and the... Congress house. I want it all. You're not an easy man to please. Am I right, Yusuf? Men like us can never be satisfied. Look at yourself! You live in a palace. But you come to these streets for solace. Men like us don't stop at food, clothing and shelter, right? We're addicted. That's true! You are definitely addicted! You live out here in the streets but you dream about my palace. No, I don't! We're business partners. Equal partners. Come on, Yusuf! Don't underestimate the power of money! Had we been equals, you wouldn't be cooking for me down there! You would be up here, eating with me. I'm kidding, buddy! I'm kidding! Auntie, I'm kidding! There's no shortage of men with deep pockets out here in Mumbai. The heart wants what it wants. Of course! I mean, that's the reason I'm investing my money in you! I'm a businessman! I recognize talent when I see it! Hey! Auntie! What about the girls? They'll be delivered tonight, boss! Yusuf Bhai! Vijay? What are you doing here? Come here! Father has always been a wimp. He's not just a wimp... he's a scoundrel! How can he abandon his kid? That's not true, auntie. He's a good man. He had looked after me... for four years after I lost my parents. He was like a father to me. Don't worry. I'll call him. Mangya, call him. Bhai, don't call him. Don't worry about it, kiddo. I'm here for you. I'll talk to him. -054-- -Bhai, please stop him! Hey! Stop worrying! Go on! Bhai, don't do it! Are you crazy? Let me talk to him. Call him! 05-- Idiot! This pocket-sized dynamite is packing some heat! Mangya... You're not like your father.

Quickly! -Salaam, Yusuf. -How are you? -All good? -Yeah. This is the new lot. It's always been crazy and wild Ever since I was a child I hope it doesn't rip my life apart My crazy heart Well, you're here. What are you planning to do next? Bhai... I have decided. I want to be the next Yusuf Chikna. Always remember one thing, kiddo. Never bite the hand that feeds you. If you want to be Yusuf Chikna... you'll have to start where I started out.

Not the movie. What's your name? -Blackie. -Blackie? Why have your parents given you a weird name? They didn't. I don't have parents. The public has christened me Blackie. Why are you interrogating me? What's your name? Red Riding Hood! Red ride? Was that supposed to be a joke? Why? If your name can be Black, why can't mine be Red? My name's not Black. It's Blackie! I sell tickets in the black market. Hence the name, Blackie. What do you sell? Tomatoes? Do you want to watch the movie? Come on! Have you watched Gupt? It's a great movie! It's full of suspense. You're giving me the same vibe. You won't stab me in the back, right? Hey! I'll definitely stab you if you don't stop yapping! You must be the saint who fasts every Thursday, right? You're running as well, right? We have the same story. What do you say? Same Story? Yeah. The guys who are looking for me, they'll bust their behinds for a few days and forget about me.

I told him that I'll buy a huge car like this when I grow up! Do you know what he said? "Forget about buying it! Try getting in the car once if you dare!" I said, "That's easy! I'll do it right away!" And I snuck in. You won't scold me for it, right? Then why are you staring at me? Get in! Let's go for a drive! Blackie! Do you really own this car? -You like it? -Obviously! I'm gonna start saving up for it today! You don't need to. Go to school, study, do your homework. I'll gift you this car when you turn 18. Really? I hope you're not fooling me, so that I do my homework. You won't forget my face, right? Not for a lifetime. Please, stop. Thank you. Bye! Don't forget! Who's the lucky girl, boss? I don't think she's from our facility. You have a weak eyesight, Yusuf. See. She's a child, boss. She'll grow up someday, right? Nobody has the time for that. Auntie, the new girl, what's her name? Shobha? -Sheela! -Sheela. You'll have fun, boss. Go, get her. Hey, auntie! Stop! Yusuf, I don't want to have fun! I'm not joking. I'm in... love with her. I've had my fair share of fun in this neighborhood. But her innocence, it makes me feel like... I'm the worst man in the word! I'm really ashamed of myself! That's it! I'm not having any more "fun". I'm now a... virgin! What gin? Not gin! Virgin! Celibate! All I will do now, is wait for her to grow up! I'll pay for all her needs! And Yusuf you will look after her! That's your responsibility! Boss, we have the best girls in town. Why are you-- Yusuf! The heart wants what it wants. -What's wrong? -Need to fill-up. I'm hungry! You can join me and shove some food down your throat if you want to. Stop it. The way you're holding on to your bag, every single person here knows that you're carrying money Listen to me... are you really gonna parade it all over the town by yourself? Come on!

What's the emergency? Sir, my wife... she's pregnant. And her mother is on her deathbed. So, she wanted to give her the good news before she dies. I'm dropping her off at the station. Which station? -Dadar. -Kurla. It's Kurla, sir. She just missed her train at Dadar. I need to take her to Kurla. She's really stressed-out, sir. She's stressed? Alright, drop me off at the police station on your way. I love your taxi, man. I love the fans and the decor. Stop turning around and watching me "Stop turning around." Have you watched it? What, sir? Shree 420. No, I haven't, sir. It's a movie about con artists. I've seen many of these in the past 20 years of my career. A few hours back... a twenty-year-old girl raided a jewelry store in Zaveri Bazar. She put a gun to the owner's head, took all the jewelry and scrammed! What are you saying, sir? Yeah! She's going to jail for seven years, at least, once we get her. What about you? Sorry? I mean how long will you be staying at your mother's place? Three months, sir. That's a tiny bag for three months. I have some clothes at my mother's place. Really? How long have you guys been married? One year, sir. And you're bored of each other in a year? Why, sir?

Who the hell are you? A guy who's on the run after almost killing a man! And now you've nicked a cop's gun as well! Bloody bandit! -I nicked it? -Yes! -I've had enough! -Stop! Stop!

You'll never read this book again. Why, Bhai? A big man's tiny little heart is pining for this book. And I've given him my word. And in our business, a man's word is more important than his life. There are many books in this neighborhood. Go for any book you like... except this one. Stay away. The rate's fixed. Two tickets for fifty! Come on! Pay up! No! Two tickets for fifty! Fifty! What's wrong? You haven't met me for the past two days. Yusuf Bhai has asked me to stay away. You won't meet me just because he asked you to stay away? Says who?

They're sending me to a boarding school in Panchghani. They're sending you to a boarding school. And they've asked me to never see you again. We should just run away! We could just go to a mountain and live peacefully! Like Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak? Yeah! Just like Aamir and Juhi! But don't they die at the end of the movie? That's a movie. That doesn't happen in real life. What happens in real life? I'll show up in the morning tomorrow. Everyone will be fast asleep. And we'll disappear. But won't these wolves come after us? When Blackie runs... the wind isn't able to get hold of him either! Don't worry! And what about him? Who? Him! He won't stop following us, right? Him? Really? Man has reached the moon.

Your name's Blackie? No, it's Anil Kapoor! Come on! Yes, my name is Blackie. Come on! Come here. Why do you have such a weird name? Blackie? I used to sell movie tickets in the black market when I was a kid. Everyone called me Blackie. What? You wanted ten thousand to give me your name. I got it for free... on a loudspeaker. -Move! Move! -Come on! Move! -Come on. -Be careful. -Come on. -Grab your seats. Easy! THE RIDE I have really screwed your life, right? You had to leave the city. You must be mad at me. No way! I was planning on leaving the city anyway. Aren't you scared? What if they catch us? You don't know me! When Blackie runs, the wind isn't able to get hold of him either! Don't worry! And what about him? Who? What about him? Who? Him! He won't stop following us, right? Man has reached the moon. The moon will never be able to get to a man! I had told you... he won't stop following us. Blackie, faster! Blackie, faster! Blackie, faster! Pooja? Red Riding Hood. Red Riding Hood! They're here! We need to leave! What are you doing, Blackie? They'll sell me, Blackie! What are you doing? I'm Pooja! What the hell are you doing? Let me go! Let me go! Blackie, what are you doing? What the hell are you doing? You're a really stubborn kid. That's what I love about you. Because Yusuf Chikna was stubborn since the day he was born. Mangya... You wanna be Yusuf Chikna, right? Here. Here's a button... that'll make you Yusuf Chikna. You use it once... and it will use you for a lifetime. Get it? Hold this. Press the button and become Yusuf Chikna. Go on. Good boy. Bhai, he won't be able to do it! Listen to me! You're a wimp! You were showing off with a knife, right? What happened? Why are you whimpering? You are a wimp just like your father! One! Two! Three! Shoot! Go on! Go on, wimp! Are you scared? Go on! Shoot! Are you scared? He's a wimp, Bhai! A bloody wimp! Bhai! Bhai! Scram! Hey! Buzz off! Go! You've got the money, right? Come on! You should be happy. You wanted five taxis, right? You can easily buy ten taxis now! Go on! She's right. You've wanted money all your life, right? You've finally hit the jackpot. What are you waiting for? Step on it! And leave! Who are you waiting for? Eyes on the road! Drive! Go on! Come on! Who are you waiting for? Go! Go! Go on! Are you waiting for someone? Come on! Hey! What the hell are you doing? Why the hell are you dozing off in the middle of the road? Go on! Move! Hey! Move! Alright, girls! See you tomorrow. I had a girl with me. We were dancing right here! Her name was Pooja. Have you seen her? She was not a girl! She was chaos! Let me go! -Hey! -Let me go! -Shut up! -Let me go! Let me go! -Hey! Shut up! -Let me go! Let her go, man. Done? Are you done? Your driver has deserted you. Come on. I'll drop you off. Come on. -Hey, stop! -Stop! -Stop her! -Come on! Stop! -Hey! What the hell are you doing in here? -Where's the girl? This is a ladies' changing room! Get out! Get out or I'll bash your brains out! Hey! Come here. They're gone. No, don't go there. -Take the back door. -Thank you. She had raised a ruckus in here. Those goons were looking for her as well. They just left... after I bashed them. Thank you. Ticket! Ticket! Ticket! Ticket! Ticket! Ticket! Ma'am, ticket! Ticket. Where do you want to go? Auntie, he wants to see your ticket. Hey! Hey, ma'am! I've seen her ticket. I need to check your ticket. Mine? One minute. Come on! Be quick! Ticket! Stop the bus! Get off the bus, bloody freeloader! What's wrong with you guys? How can you leave me here? I am going to teach you a lesson. Every single one of you is gonna die in an accident! Stop the bus! Have you seen this girl? Sorry, sir. I haven't. Come on. Think about it. She was wearing a green salwar kameez. No, man! I haven't seen her! Do you want me to sign an affidavit? Do you have a photo? No. Think about it. She was wearing a white kurta and a dupatta. She was wearing something on her nose. You know, the thing that women wear? No, I haven't seen her. I-- Was I wrong, Yusuf? All I wanted was to wear this! I wanted to wear this and stand in front of Pooja like this! And I've done every possible thing I could! I was a virgin for ten years! I controlled myself! It was difficult for me! But I did it. Because just like you said, "The heart wants what it wants." Look at me! I'm a joke, Yusuf! And this is how I'll be! Till the moment you get Pooja back to me, this is how I'll be! The rest is up to you! I'll get Pooja back. And if I don't get her back... shoot me... here. So, my soldiers... tell me. Why did Sholay flop? Because the movie portrayed us cops as fools! Look at Mr. Asrani! He was a jailer from the British era! Even a fly couldn't snoop in and out of his prison on his watch. But Amit and Dharam... they snuck up on Mr. Asrani and they put a piece of wood to the back of his head. Mr. Asrani was an innocent soul. He mistook that piece of wood for a gun. He was scared. And that's how Amit and Dharam broke out of the prison! These cops look like dolts. Time for Plan B, Blackie. -Hey! -Hey! -Hey! Hey! Stop! -Amitabh Bachchan said-- Sir, I-- You're waiting for a taxi, right? I am the driver. Sir, he's our guy! Hey! Lower your weapons. Lower it! He's not our guy. According to the information we've received, the taxi number should be 6969. But the number on this license plate is 9696. Sir, I switched the plates. Sir, he's our guy! He is not our guy! As per the information, there should be a girl... and a guy. The guy's here. But where's the girl? She took off. Sir, I'm telling you he's our guy! He is not our guy! What are you going to tell me next? That your name is-- What was the name? Vijay Chauhan. Hey! Get in position! Arrest him! I knew it! He's our guy! You idiot! You kept repeating, "He isn't our guy!" -Come on! Arrest him! -Yes, sir! Yes, Bhai, we-- We had found Pooja. But we lost her in the fair. Have you lost it? If I tell Bhai about this, he's gonna strangle my neck through the phone! What did I do? How can we lose her in a bloody fair! Is she a kid? Have some soda, boss. Do you know why Dhoom flopped? In that movie... the lead cop... he wasn't a badass! The famous criminal-- Who was he? John. John! John was running away. And the cop, Abhishek, just couldn't get him! That's not true. These things just happen in movies. In reality, criminals like you, just walk into our den. Do you really think we won't be able to get her? Why? Because she has changed her look! Just like my taxi. She's a really cunning girl! She's roaming around in public! Get me a Pepsi. Get me a dal makhni, butter chicken, bheja ghotala, kheema fry, egg curry, chicken biryani, mutton pulao, paneer makkhanwala and three parathas with some ghee. With some ghee? No. No ghee for me. Cancel it. And listen... please wash your hands. Sir, please! He doesn't want us to nab the girl. He's trying to save her. Yes, sir! He could've just run away with the money. But he has surrendered. Because you want the cops to find her for you. Do you really think we are fools? Hey! Call Tavde and tell him we've nabbed the driver. Sir, please listen to me! -Take him away! -Come on! -Sir, I'm telling you-- -Lock him up! Yeah, tell me. A message for Mumbai Crime Branch from police station number 17. They have Vijay Chauhan, the driver of taxi number 6969 in custody They have positively confirmed this message. Yeah, alright. Hey, take a right. Let's meet our taxi driver. Hey! Hey! Where's the girl who was sitting here? She ran away! She hasn't paid for the food! Hey! Is this the girl? Yes, that's the girl! -Where did she go? -Hey! You bloody... -Move! Move! -Hey, auntie! Move! -Move! Move! -Get in there! -Move! Move! -Hey, shut up! -Come on! Come on! -Get in there! Get up! Hello, Mr. Bhim Singh? I'm the owner of Alif Dhaba. Yeah, we're on our way. Congratulations! Bunty... we have found your Babli. Are you serious? Where is she? At the Alif Dhaba! Come on! Let's go! Get the car. Sir! Sir! Please listen to me. I have a great plan! Plan? What plan? The bag's full of money You can have it. Hey, hero! We've informed the Mumbai Crime Branch. Mr. Tavde is on his way. You can tell him about your grand schemes! Right, sir? Sir, let's go, please! We'll lose the girl. No! No! One minute. Hold up. Hold up. If... I take these bags... what-- What am I going to say to Mr. Tavde? Sir, I have a plan for that as well! A brilliant plan! Sir, he's trying to con us! -Please listen to me. -But we are not letting him con us, right? Sir-- Tell me. You can tell Mr. Tavde-- Please come closer. Tell Mr. Tavde... -that I put a gun to your head! -Hey! -Hey! -Hey! Hey! One minute! Shut up. Shut up. Alright. Alright, so you put a gun to my head. What next? Then... you said, "Mannu, open the door!" Mannu, open the door! Sir, he's conning us! But Mannu didn't agree. Then you reminded Mannu that you are his boss! -And he's just a... -Havildar. Havildar Mannu, open the door! Sir, he'll run away! Open the door! Mangya, I've found her! Hey! Stop! -Stop! -Hey! -She went that way! -Did you see her? -Hey! Where is she? -That way! Check there! Hey! I've had enough of this nonsense! Come on! -Let me go! -Come on! Come on! I left the gun, got my keys. Then, I got the bags... and I came here. That's a good plan. But it sounds like a Bollywood movie. That's the problem, sir. I've spent my childhood outside a theater selling two tickets for fifty. My life is a Bollywood movie. Mr. Bhim Singh come in. -I'll take your leave, sir. -Some goons fired a gun at Alif Dhaba. They have kidnapped a girl. They are in a Black Scorpio and are going towards the Shivali Bridge. Hey! -Hey! -Hey! Blackie! Why are you like this? You are just like you were... ten years ago. Go on! Shoot! One! Two! Three! Shoot, you wimp! You are a bloody wimp! You are a wimp just like your father! I told you, Bhai! He's a wimp! You are just like your father! A wimp! You bloody... Blackie! Hey! Move! Come on! Blackie! Let him go, Blackie! Blackie, let him go! What are you doing? Blackie, stop this! You are a bloody wimp! You are a wimp just like your father! Where are you, Mangya? Heaven, if he has good karma. The hospital, if he doesn't. Pooja was mine. And she'll always be mine. Come at me with all you got. He tried to bribe me. I didn't accept it. You should have. I could've helped you after I suspend you. Sir! Sir! Should I let them out? Let them go! Leaving them in there, stains the police force's reputation. Are you alright? Pull over. -What? -Pull over! Why? Pull over or I'll jump off! Hey! Are you crazy? Pooja! Hey! -Have you lost it? -Don't touch me! Don't touch me! I fought those goons for you. And all I get is, "Don't touch me"? So what? You were the one who sold me to those goons! I thought I knew you. But I don't. I saw what you did to Mangya back there. Bloody animal! Hey, one minute! What was I supposed to do? Give him a peck on his cheek and request him to let you go? No! You could just ask for more money! You could've sold me again! I'm a product, right? What did you say? What did you say on that phone call? "Pooja was mine. And she'll always be mine!" What am I? Your property? You'll come save me and abandon me whenever it suits you? What the hell is wrong with you, Pooja? I came back, right? I came back because I realized my mistake! Those two bags in the car, they're worth an amount that has more zeros than I can count! But all I know is... it'll amount to zero if I don't have you. Go on! Get it out of your system. Call me a rascal, a scoundrel, a dog! But I'm the same Blackie, Pooja. Your Blackie. The one from your childhood. You're right! You're the same Blackie! You abandoned me back then! And you're doing the same thing now! I had to run away, Pooja. -Talking to you is useless! -Hold up! It's useless because you've got nothing to say! I'm telling you I was forced to run away! -Would you have died? -You would've died! Yusuf wanted me to shoot you! One! Two! Three! Go on! Shoot! Go on! Shoot! Why are you whimpering? Shoot! Come on! Are you scared? He's a wimp, Bhai! He's a wimp! Bhai! Bhai! Bhai, please don't kill Pooja! Bhai! Please don't kill her, Bhai! Please, Bhai, let her go! You want her to live, right? -Yes, Bhai. -You want her to live, right? Right? -Then stay away from this neighborhood. -Yes, Bhai. I'll blow her brains out if I see you here! Go. Run! I did not abandon you, Pooja! I ran away because I wanted to save you! Every-- Every time you have walked into my life, that's the only time I've had some fun. The rest of my life has been one huge traffic jam. I keep honking. But a lane opens up every time you show up. Cruising at 120 isn't as fun as sneaking into a no-entry zone with you! And you are accusing me of-- Make a decision, Pooja! Come with me if you want a partner for life! Or we can go our separate ways. Blackie! Why do you always make a mess? There's less love and a lot of stress Why do you make me pine? Drop your ego Come just be mine You think you're a big fish But you're just a basic dish Why don't you get it? Why don't you just quit it? My heart Yes, my heart You've ripped it apart! Yes, my heart! My heart Yes, my heart You've ripped it apart! Yes, my heart! Why do you make a scene? You're not the bloody queen I'm perfect for you Come on, baby, don't be mean! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me Why do your sweet lips always spit fire? Why's the air on fire? Why am I overcome by desire? Your eyes have locked onto my heart It's gonna die in the crossfire Tell me! Tell me! Tell me Why do your sweet lips always spit fire? Why do you always make a mess? There's less love and a lot of stress Why do you make me pine? Drop your ego Come just be mine You are a slippery slope My poor heart has no hope Every time you blush My poor heart is crushed My heart Yes, my heart You've ripped it apart! Yes, my heart My heart Yes, my heart You've ripped it apart! Yes, my heart Don't worry, babe It's not your fault My moves are more intoxicating Than a bottle of single malt Kissed me Once you have kissed me Try as hard as you can, baby You won't be able to resist me Your ego's gonna go down You're gonna drop your crown You're gonna accept this clown I'm gonna set you straight Why do you always make a mess? There's less love and a lot of stress Why do you make me pine? Drop your ego Come just be mine You think you're a big fish But you're just a basic dish Why don't you get it? Why don't you just quit it? My heart Yes, my heart You've ripped it apart! Yes, my heart My heart Yes, my heart You've ripped it apart! Yes, my heart Viju... Father? Yes, son. Father, how did you get my number-- Is Yusuf there? Yes, son. You should come back as well. Father? You told me that your old man's dead? I had told myself the same thing... back when I abandoned him. -Father, let's go! The cops are coming! -Viju! Viju! Listen to me! We've made a mistake. We should just surrender ourselves. -What? -Yes, son. It's my fault! A wrong path never leads to the right destination. -Father, we'll miss the train! -Listen to me! We have time. We could live here and work hard. We can live an honest life! We don't want to live like Yusuf! Father, you can stay here if you want to! I'm leaving! And people were right about you! You'll always be a failure! You're a bloody wimp! I'm leaving! -Vijay, listen to me! -Let me go! -Hey! Get him! -Viju, run! -Get them! Hey! Stop! -Viju, run! Viju! -Viju, run! -Hey, stop! -Let him go! -Get him! He hung up. I don't think Vijay's coming back. You're right, Father. Vijay won't come back. Blackie will. Vijay had anyway abandoned you when he was a kid. People say that love either derails one's life... or gets it back on the track. Since the day your son has met this girl... he has been doing the right thing. What can be more "right" than saving his own father? Blackie will be here. You have always spoiled the end of every movie we have seen. Can you tell me how our story ends, Blackie? There's just one way. I'll drop you off at Gorakhpur and go see my father. Pooja? Gone. You can go as well. Have you lost it? I'm not letting you go alone. I'll come. Well done, my baby brother! It's useless. We'll both lose if we go there together. Don't you have a third plan, Blackie? One that has a happy ending? You were right, Father. The wrong path never leads to the right destination. I wish I hadn't ran away. Things eventually work out, son. If you hadn't ran away back then... you would've never met her. He's here to kill you. Come on. That's enough. Take him in and make love for as long as you want Go on. Have some. What's wrong? Have some. We have a long drive ahead of us. We won't be making any pit stops. Alright. Come on. She's not going. Who's gonna stop me? You? His father! He's here to kill you. I'm here to kill him. He has a gun. So do I. This is what they call a stand-off, Father. We have two options. Bullets will fly. People will die. That's what Father wants. Option two. Not a single shot is fired. No one dies. That is what I want. Which father do you agree with? Look at him, Father! You've made the right decision for the second time in your life. The first one was to abandon her when you were a kid. And today's the second! Jimmy! Get the car. Jimmy! Jimmy. -Jimmy? -Let's go! Hey! Give me your gun. Hey, stop. Stop! Let me handle them. Don't say a word. What's up? Were you waiting for us? Sir, here's your property. Sir. Here you go. I had sent you an invitation, sir. Where's this tollbooth? It's 30 kilometers away from Rampur. You've invited us to a party that's happening at your father's place? Who's the guest of honor? Mr. Yusuf Chikna. The one from Kamatipura? You ran away from Yusuf Chikna's home? I'll handle Yusuf. But the two of you will have to be my witnesses... and testify in court. We'll do it, sir. Sure? Sure. And you? Me too, sir. Keep it. -No, sir. -Keep it. Make sure your hands don't shiver the next time you see Yusuf. Hey! Come on! Come on! Mumbai Crime Branch! Which unit are you from? Mr. Shaikh from Unit number three... is a very good friend of mine. You've come a long way from Mumbai, Mr. Tavde. I hope the department's compensating you well. I can do it if they haven't. And with my compensation, Mr. Tavde... you've come here in a car but you'll go back in a chopper. Hey, Yusuf! I'm not a girl from your brothel! Am I clear? Get in! Tread carefully, Mr. Tavde. I'm giving you a fair shot. I told you, Tavde. Tread carefully. This door is shorter than I am! Don't worry. Bhim Singh is here! Lock the door and the windows. Sir, we are cops! Why are we hiding? No! We aren't hiding! We're getting in position! Sir! Mr. Tavde's working really hard! I just don't get it. He's a cop! Why is he working so hard? Mr. Tavde! Jai Hind, sir! We're looking out for you! -Mannu... -Yes, sir? this must be happening for the first time! The cops are on both sides of the bars! Great! Hey! Father! Father! Father! Father? Vijay, lie down! Pretend that you're dead! What the hell's wrong with you? Stop these idiotic theatrics! There are bullets flying all over the place! Yusuf's taking Pooja away! Go after him, Viju! I'll be fine! The goon has taken the girl! -Sir, let's go! -Hey! Don't try to be the hero. Let the hero do his job. Check him out. Here he goes! You've made a mistake. You should've walked away. I'm doing the right thing for the first time in my life. Now's not the time to run. It's time to stand my ground. And what are you gonna do by "standing your ground"? You're never going to be Yusuf Chikna. You'll never read this book again. Why, Bhai? A big man's tiny little heart is pining for this book. And I've given him my word. I told you to stay away, right? You'll never see her again. Am I clear? Get up! Bhai, please don't kill Pooja! Bhai! -You want her to live, right? -Yes, Bhai. Right? -Then stay away from this neighborhood. -Yes, Bhai. I'll blow her brains out if I see you here! Go. Scram! Because of you my life-- What's your name? Red Riding Hood! -Was that supposed to be a joke? -Why? If your name can be Black, why can't mine be Red? Blackie? -That's a weird name! -You haven't met me for the past two days. Yusuf Bhai has asked me to stay away. You won't meet me just because he asked you to stay away? No! Pooja is the one who has suffered the most because of you! She's the one who deserves to finish you off. Here, Pooja. Finish him. What are you thinking about? Ice him! Pull the trigger, Pooja! Don't think about it! Pull the trigger, Pooja. She won't be able to do it. -Pooja finish him off! -Hey! If you want to kill Yusuf, shoot here! Pooja, shoot him! I told you. She won't be able to do it! I told you. She won't be able to do it! And no one can "become" Yusuf. Because Yusufs are born! We asked him to surrender. But the suspect started firing. It was an act of self-defense, sir. And an act worthy of a Gallantry medal. We were the ones who got rid of Yusuf. But the final nail in his coffin came from the government. Everyone made a profit that day. Pooja... me... Mr. Tavde nabbed a medal as well. And the government welcomed Chowksi in prison. Pooja was right. She wanted a happy ending for our story. Here it is. Here's your happy ending. We aren't done yet. There's more. -Hey, what are you doing? -Get in! Let's move! -What do you mean? -Let's go! Hey! What the hell! -The whole wedding party's here! -They're goons! Come on! What the hell did you do this time? -Bloody hell! Who the hell are they? -Let's go!
