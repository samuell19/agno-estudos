WAREHOUSED MONDAY Are you the new guy? They said you'd be here some weeks ago. There's so much to explain and such little time. What's your name? -Nin. -Nin? What kind of name is that? I'm Mr. Lino. I spent 11 years training before I was put in charge. You will be in charge in just five days. You're a lucky man, Nin. What a short name. Is it a diminutive? No. It doesn't really matter. Come. Let's get down to business. Nobody's worn it for 28 years. I used to wash it every fortnight. You'll have to do that from now on. Each man washes his own. Got it? You have to punch the card twice a day. Once when you clock in, and once when you clock out. They replace them every month. They mail us the new ones and I send them the old ones. You work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Got it? You're going to have to clock in earlier from now on. Look at the time card. TIME CARD It says 7:05 a.m. The machine is seven minutes ahead of the clock. You have to punch in at 6:53 a.m. so it records the time as 7:00 a.m. When they get your card at Headquarters, they'll see you were five minutes late on your first day. -But I got here on time. -What matters is what's on the card. Got it? Got it. Come on. In this book we record all the merchandise that comes from the factory. Here we record all the merchandise we have to send to the Sales Department. Here we record all leftovers, defective or not, that must be returned to the factory. Got it? The telephone is to be used solely to get orders from the Sales Department or to request merchandise from the factory. Absolutely no personal calls. Got it? Yeah, got it. I'll take care of everything until Friday. You'll be in charge of loading and unloading of merchandise under my supervision. Any questions? Yes. What merchandise? Don't you know the name of the company? Salvaleón. Salvaleón Aluminum Masts and Flagpoles Corporation. It's the second largest manufacturer of aluminum masts and flagpoles in the country. Even the United States Embassy hangs its flags from our poles. The ad said, "Warehouse manager wanted, Salvaleón." It didn't mention aluminum rods. They're not rods. They're masts and poles. Poles for flags, and masts for boats. We're going to have to start from the beginning. Mr. Salvaleón owns one factory, two warehouses, plus Headquarters, where the Sales Department is located. There are 166 employees in total. Most of them work in the factory. From there, flagpoles are shipped to Warehouse A, and masts to Warehouse B. That's us. We don't touch the flagpoles, we only store the masts. Got it? Got it. The masts come in four different sizes, which need to be separated into groups right here. The loading and unloading area must be kept clear at all times, so it's ready for whenever a truck comes. And this part of the warehouse is for leftovers, divided into defective and non-defective goods, that must be returned to the factory. Got it? Yes, it's crystal clear. Crystal clear? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. It doesn't seem to be that difficult. Fine. Let's get down to business. It's getting late. Nin. What kind of name is that? I don't know. My dad gave it to me. He died right after I was born. He died without telling anybody why he gave you such a name? How strange. Mr. Lino, shouldn't we be doing something? I know we have to wait for the trucks to come, but meanwhile shouldn't we be sweeping the warehouse? It gets swept 15 minutes before the end of the shift. It'd be absurd to sweep when a truck could arrive at any given moment. Of course. I hadn't thought about that. You ought to think about it. How often do trucks come? They come when they come. Does the factory let us know? No, it doesn't. And what about orders from Sales? Do they let us know? No, they don't. There's something I don't understand, Mr. Lino. I thought everything was crystal clear. Yes, it's crystal clear, but there isn't any merchandise here. Like I said, a truck may arrive at any time. I'm sorry, there's only one chair, and it's meant to be used by the senior employee. I spent 11 years on my feet until the last manager retired. You only have to spend five days. How long have you worked here? Thirty-nine years. I'd be here five more years if it weren't for my arthritis. They're retiring me due to chronic illness. As if I were incapable of taking care of this place. We'll see if a kid can handle all this responsibility. I don't mean to take anybody's job. I know, son. I know. Around here, everybody gets down to business. At what time do you have breakfast? At 10:00 a.m. You mean 9:53 a.m.? Don't forget the seven minutes. Breakfast is at 10:00 a.m. sharp. The seven minutes are only for the time card. We clock out at 2:53 p.m. so our time cards say 3:00 p.m., right? We clock out at 3:00 p.m. I've always clocked out at 3:00 p.m., no matter what time it says. Okay. What difference do seven minutes make? -May I go to the store? -There aren't any stores close by. What if a truck comes and you're not here? I can't unload it with my arthritis. I have to answer the phone and record everything in the books. I can't do it all by myself. Got it. -What's in it? -Egg salad. Aren't you thirsty? You should never eat and drink at the same time. You should drink before or after you eat. Mr. Lino, when was the last time a truck came? What difference does it make? You weren't even working here then. Knowing when the last one came, and the one before that, we could figure out when the next one will come. They come when they come, damn it! -I was just curious. -You're too curious. We get down to business here. In the meantime, we can talk, can't we? As long as it's about work, I don't see why not. You said that Salvaleón Corporation is the second largest mast and flagpole manufacturer. That's correct. Saltamar Corporation is the largest. -Do we manufacture a lot? -Quite a bit. Bear in mind that Mr. Blackmoon, the Ambassador of the USA, is our client. Not only are the flagpoles at the embassy ours, also those in every US consulate in the country. They are replaced every three years. That's in terms of aluminum rods. -Flagpoles! -Flagpoles. But you said those belong to Warehouse A. What about the sailboat masts? We're also the second largest manufacturer of those. Again, the largest one is Saltamar Corporation. Do we produce a lot of them? There's greater demand for flagpoles, we make more of those. And in terms of sales? How many masts do we sell? Oh, they sell. Otherwise they wouldn't manufacture them. No trucks came today. That's the way it is. Some days you work non-stop, and other days there's nothing to do. As in any other job. Sales hasn't called either. The work comes and goes. At the beginning, it can be hard. But you're lucky. You'll go from assistant to manager in only five days. And is the salary a lot better? It's a fixed salary. How much is it? You ask too many questions. Around here, we get down to business. I'd like to know how much I can aspire to. Are you ashamed? 3,880 pesos a month. 3,880 pesos after working here for 40 years? 39 years. That's what they've always paid you? Keep in mind we work part-time. Part-time? It's an eight-hour shift! You have the afternoons free. -It's an eight-hour shift! -It's a fixed salary. -Got it? -Got it. TUESDAY Not like that. What's the matter? Weren't you listening yesterday? I explained everything step by step. You come and do it all wrong. -I got here on time. -No. -Yes, it says 7:00 a.m. -But that's not how it's done. You have to put on your smock before you clock in. Your shift begins once you're wearing your uniform. Those are the rules. Got it? Putting on the uniform isn't part of the job? Of course not. Then, why don't you ever put it on outside of work? -Are you trying to be funny? -No. I think that work starts when you arrive at work. We don't need wise guys around here. Here we get down to business. You clock in after you put on your smock. It's always been done that way. Got it? Got it. -Should I clock in again? -That won't be necessary. But remember that for the next time. What? Is there a problem? It's not that. It's just that... -I don't know. It just seems strange. -Strange? It's just a chair. Yes. It's not the chair. It's the situation. The two of us sitting here. I don't know... It's strange. -I shouldn't be seated? -Not necessarily. As long as you get up when a truck comes, but... But? Nothing... It's late. -Let's get down to business. -Let's. What are you laughing about? I'm not laughing. -You were. -I didn't laugh. I was thinking. I was thinking about the 11 years I spent standing. I never thought of bringing a chair from home. -So, it does bother you. -No, no. It's fine. You must think it's unfair that you stood up all those years and I sat down on my second day. No, it's not that. It's just that something like that never occurred to me. Of course, those were different times. Other things were important to us. We would get down to business. How did he die? What? Your dad. How did he die? I didn't say he died. Yes, you did. Yesterday. Your dad gave you that name and died without telling anybody why. You said that. Well, he didn't exactly die. He left, which is like dying. He named you that and then he left? Yes, he gave me this name and took off. Well, that's not right. A father shouldn't do that. Shouldn't do what? Name his son Nin or take off? Abandon his family. It's no surprise you go around saying he's dead. I don't do that. I just said that to you. -Why? -I don't know. Maybe because I didn't know you very well. I don't know you very well, but since you brought it up... -I brought it up? -Yeah. In any case, Nin is a weird name. It's not normal. It seems like no trucks are coming today either. No. That's the way it goes. And then, two come at the same time. It would be nice if one showed up. That's the way it goes. -The telephone didn't ring either. -No, it didn't. But you have to be ready. The phone could ring just as a truck is pulling up. Or the phone could ring as two trucks pull up and we're having breakfast. That's true. Perhaps we should eat in shifts. Do you think that's necessary? You never know, Nin. Mr. Lino. What will you do after you retire? I haven't given it much thought yet. Mr. Lino, the floor is covered with ants. There's an ant's nest over there. I've thought of exterminating them, but they don't do any harm. They've been making the same trip for 39 years, from the door to the nest and from the nest to the door, without deviating a millimeter from their path. Have you been watching them all this time? Only when there's no work. I wouldn't mess with them if I were you. They make good company. You only have to look at them to realize that the world works. It doesn't stop. -Do you want to hear something about ants? -What? All the ants in the world weigh more than all the people combined. -That's nonsense. -It's true! Who's going to take the time to weigh them? Nobody. Maybe now you have something to do when you retire. Mr. Lino. -I know why you like ants. -Why's that? They get down to business. WEDNESDAY Good morning. -Do I have to get up? -What? Do I have to get up to show you how to do it again? That won't be necessary. Good. Because I just sat down. I won't mess up this time. It's 6:53 a.m., which means I'm clocking in right on time. Fantastic. Of course, I'm wearing my smock. As it should be. Since when has the machine been ahead of the clock? For as long as I've been here. And you have never called Headquarters so they can come and fix it? Of course not. You think they don't have anything better to do? Seven minutes a day over 39 years add up to a lot of hours. A lot! Just multiply it. I'm not wasting my time doing math. Hey, Mr. Lino... Damn it, the clock is ticking! She said no And I said yes We never came to an agreement And we fell out of love You're in a good mood today. Yes, I am. -So, why's that? -No particular reason. By the way... you'll have to close up on your own today. Don't tell me you have a date. Something like that. With a woman? With Mr. Salvaleón. At ten o'clock, in his office. Is it serious? Very serious. The company accountant will be there too. I have to sign my retirement papers. -I don't get it. -Get what? Why you're so happy. You don't really want to retire. -Yes, I do. -No, you don't. I can tell. I think you're happy because Mr. Salvaleón invited you to his office. How often do you see him? Once a year? Mr. Salvaleón drops by sometimes. -How often? -Quite a bit. -How often is that? Once a month? -Well, it depends. Right, just like the trucks. Some days he doesn't come over at all, and other days, he comes over multiple times. -You don't believe trucks come? -I didn't say that. Trucks come, I tell you. This is the slow season, that's all. You'll get sick of unloading trucks, arranging merchandise and recording it in the books. And, as for Mr. Salvaleón, he doesn't need to come around because he has complete confidence in me. For the time being, Warehouse B is in capable hands! We'll see what happens after that. We'll see, you snot-nosed kid. He's never been to the warehouse, has he? You've probably never met him in your life. Every year, he sends me a Christmas greeting. Today you're seeing him in person, that's why you're in a good mood. What will you do when you meet him? I'm going to thank him, that's all. Then, I'll come back and work until Friday, not a day after that. I'm looking forward to retirement. It's my wife who isn't. She doesn't want me home all day, getting in the way. You don't have to stay home all day. I suppose you're right. I have a son. He's older than you. Married. Maybe he'll give me a grandchild soon. And the kid will keep me busy. It's time for me to be a grandfather. Mr. Salvaleón is younger than me, and he has a 2-year-old granddaughter. There was a picture of her in last year's Christmas card. If my grandchild is born next year, there would be... a four-year difference. Four years isn't that much. I can't believe it! You're fantasizing about this! How so? You're imagining that 15 or 20 years from now, your grandson, who isn't even born yet, will meet Mr. Salvaleón's granddaughter and they'll fall hopelessly in love. Stop it! That's enough! They pay me to work, not to put up with insolence! Around here, we get down to business. Got it? Yes or no? Nin. Nin! Got it. My time card is upside down. So what? I would never place my time card upside down. Oh, shit. -This can't be happening. -Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Did you clock in on my time card? -I didn't mean to. -You idiot. You used my time card. What am I going to do now? What will I do? Today of all days! It had to happen today! It's your fault! It's all your fault! This is a disaster! Mr. Lino, it's not that bad. Not that bad? Do you know what this means? -It's just an extra stamp. -Just an extra stamp? In 39 years, I've never made such a mistake! You know what they're going to say about me at Headquarters? "The old man's going senile, his brain's getting rusty." Mr. Salvaleón might even see it and say: "At least we're putting the old geezer out to pasture early." What will they remember me for at the company? I'll take full responsibility. Who's going to listen to you? You're nobody in this company! Get out. -Are you firing me? -Get out! You're stepping on my ants. You already killed at least a dozen of them. I wanted to ask Mr. Salvaleón to reconsider his decision. I thought you wanted to retire. Of course not! Nobody likes being told they are no longer useful. Maybe they're right to make me retire. I've been here so long, I'm starting to make mistakes. It was my mistake, Mr. Lino. No. I should have been supervising you. You're not ready yet, and I don't think you'll ever be. Some people are good at it, and some people aren't, Nin. Nin... What kind of father gives his son a name like that? What kind of father abandons his family? A father teaches you everything you need to know. It's no wonder you're like him... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Don't worry about it. It's not your fault that your father abandoned you. Really, don't worry about it. Did you ever hear from him? Never. He could at least have told you why he named you that. Do you hear that? Hear what? Help me, Nin! Is it a truck? It's one of ours! Do you know where the Saltamar warehouse is? It's better that it wasn't one of ours. I mean, you have to be at Headquarters at ten. That's true. I can't miss my appointment with Mr. Salvaleón and leave you alone to unload a truck by yourself. It's better this way. Can I be honest with you? I've been waiting for a truck for three days. When I finally thought one was coming... I felt lazy. I imagined myself unloading aluminum rods, piling them up in that corner according to size. I imagined you recording everything in the books, answering calls, and it really made me lazy. I was glad when that guy said "Saltamar". -Masts. -What? They're not aluminum rods. They're masts. And you shouldn't be glad to see the competition's truck. If it wasn't for them, we would be number one. Did I tell you that Mr. Blackmoon, the U.S. Ambassador, is our client? Yeah. You told me that on my first day. And they replace them every three years. But we don't even deal with the flagpoles, just the masts. What a disaster, my goodness! What a disaster! It's a pleasure, Mr. Salvaleón. How is your granddaughter? On the contrary, thank you. By the way, I'd like to talk about a small issue concerning my punch card. Nin... I'll be back to close up. Didn't you say I'd close today? After the issue with my card, you can't be trusted. I'll be back before 3:00 p.m. Don't even get out of your seat while I'm gone. What if a truck comes? It can wait. We'll unload it when I get back. If the phone rings, answer it but don't say anything. Answer but not say anything? Just tell them the manager is in a meeting at Headquarters. I have to get out of my chair to answer the phone. I'll take that risk, but only in the event of a call. And don't you dare use my absence to call your girlfriend. I don't have a girlfriend. What do you mean? By your age, I was already married. Because you got down to business. Good morning, may I speak with Mr. Salvaleón, please? It's Dr. Quezada calling. Psychiatrist. No, he doesn't know me, but it's urgent I speak to him. No, it can't wait. It's truly an urgent matter. Listen miss, let's get this straight. It's a matter of life and death. Thank you. Hello? Mr. Salvaleón? My name is Doctor Quezada. I'm a psychiatrist. No, we haven't met. But there is an urgent matter involving one of your employees. I am calling about a Mr. Lino. I understand he has a meeting with you in 30 minutes, correct? We have enough time. Look, what I am about to tell you is confidential. Are you alone? Is your accountant trustworthy? Very well. Look, sir. Mr. Lino... has been my patient for three years now. His problem wasn't serious, but... Arthritis? Didn't I say I'm a psychiatrist? No, Mr. Lino suffers from a serious mental illness. Yes, paranoid schizophrenia. 3888 PER MONTH Let me fill you in. Remember the punch card machine at the warehouse where he works? That machine is at the root of his breakdown. 20 DAYS 194 PER DAY Mr. Lino has worked at that warehouse for 39 years. During all those years, there's been a seven-minute difference between the time on the clock and the machine. He has clocked in every morning at 6:53 a.m. for the machine to stamp it at 7:00 a.m. But he's always clocked out at exactly 3:00 p.m. If you check his punch cards, you'll see it for yourself. He didn't care before, but now it has become an obsession. He feels your company owes him for all that time. Yes it's absurd! What do you expect from a schizophrenic? I'm calling you because I'm very concerned. No, no. About you. I don't know how to say this without alarming you. Lino has had other attacks in the past with violent outcomes. No, there's no need to call the police. I'm his doctor, listen to me. I'm going to tell you how to behave. The first thing that you have to do when he arrives is greet him with a big hug. 24 PER HOUR 0.40 PER MINUTE Sure, hug him. No. He won't attack you. Embrace him as if he were a dear friend, like a brother. Yes, I think it's necessary. Hug him. Hug him! Do you have any liquor in your office? Whiskey? Whiskey will do. Have a glass with him. Better make it two. The accountant too, show camaraderie. 240 DAYS A YEAR Then, you have to do something that will surprise him. I know, sing him a good-bye song. I have 30 years of experience as a psychiatrist, Mr. Salvaleón. I demand respect. The song is an important element of shock. Now, you have a two-year-old granddaughter, don't you? Well, Lino mentioned her during one of his attacks. Relax! You'll be fine. Ask the accountant if he knows a song. A ranchera song. Perfect. You have 20 minutes to learn it. Look, write this number down. 26,395 pesos. That's what you owe him. Sure, I jotted everything down. He earns 3,880 pesos a month. That would be 194 pesos a day. Which makes 24 an hour, 40 cents a minute. If we multiply that by seven minutes, we get a total of 2.82 pesos. He estimated... Don't interrupt me, damn it! He estimated 9,360 work days over the past 39 years. If we multiply 9,360 days by 2.82 pesos, it gives us a total of 26,395 pesos. I know you owe him nothing, but he believes you do. Listen, man. Let me be straight with you. Listen, I think you have two options. One: you can spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder, hiring bodyguards for your granddaughter. Or you can just pay this nutcase the 26,000 pesos. It's a drop in the bucket for you. Of course. Consider it a bonus for the time this guy put into your company. Sure. Got it? I'll let you go now, you have a lot to rehearse. Sure, I'll give your secretary my number. No need, man. At your service, pal. Nothing of it. No, you don't owe me anything. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Hello? Hello, miss. I'd like to ask you something. Do you place many orders for sailboat masts? How did the meeting go? It was just paperwork. Just paperwork, that's it? Just paperwork. THURSDAY I know, Mr. Lino. I'm late. Stay away from the machine! I already clocked you in at 6:53 a.m. Thank you. That was really nice. I didn't do it to be nice. It was a preventive measure. Hey, when you got back yesterday, you didn't ask if anything happened while you were gone. I figured nothing happened. Everything was in one piece when I got back. And you wouldn't tell me how the meeting went. Like I said, just paperwork. I thought something happened. You looked out of sorts. What did you expect to happen? I just went in to sign my retirement papers. So you just signed them and left? We had a drink. You had a drink? Mr. Salvaleón insisted on treating me to three drinks. I never drink. Alcohol doesn't sit well with me. It gives me diarrhea and hives. Look! I spent all night going to the bathroom. My body can't take alcohol, especially whiskey. It tastes like... -Like rotting wood? -No. Like a wet umbrella. Well, shall we get down to business? Let's do that. I think they're intimidated by you. -What? -The ants. I think they're disturbed by your presence. They've spent 39 years walking back and forth on the same path and now they're all over the place. Do you think they can see you? Ants can't see. They know you're here. That's why they changed their path. Is what you said true? What did I say? That all the ants in the world weigh more than all the people combined? Yeah, I read it in a magazine. It also said that they have ventilation systems in their nests, and that they milk other bugs to feed themselves. It's good they can't see, or else they'd have televisions. Nin. May I ask you something? Do you know the song that goes... I came here Because I came here To the flower festival No mountain is too high for me And no horse too mean No. Never heard it before. What song is that? I don't know, they sang horribly. Who did? Can you keep a secret? I don't think Mr. Salvaleón is all there. When I got to his office, the first thing I did was ask about his granddaughter, and he pounced on me and started hugging me. I think he was even crying. He was singing, then? Him and the company accountant. They were horribly off key, and they only knew that chorus. I came here Because I came here To the flower festival No mountain is too high for me And no horse too mean Maybe it was just a good-bye song. Then he handed me a check. A bonus for my devotion to the company. You're not going to believe this, but Mr. Salvaleón knew about the seven minutes. It's incredible. The man has 166 employees, and he knows my punch cards by heart. He's going to realize I clocked in twice. I won't think about that now. I have a premonition. I'm certain a truck is going to show up. Really? Did Mr. Salvaleón say so? No, not him. When I was leaving his office, I overheard his secretary talking to somebody. A doctor, I think. He called to inquire about sailboat masts. Right. I told you, that's the way it is. You shouldn't obsess over the trucks. You wait and when they come, they come. I bet the phone will ring before breakfast. I've had to go to the bathroom for a while, but I haven't budged because of that. Aren't you having breakfast, Mr. Lino? I can't eat anything. My stomach is still in knots. Headquarters are late to call. All comes in due time. You should eat something. It's the best thing for a hangover. I don't have a hangover. Alcohol doesn't sit well with me, that's all. Today of all days that you're not well, a truck has to come. I can't wait any longer. I'll leave the door open just in case. Don't touch it! Don't touch it! I'll answer! Don't say a single word! -Hurry, they're going to hang up. -Silence! Salvaleón Aluminum Masts and Flagpoles, Warehouse B. Mr. Lino speaking. How may I help you? Yes. Yes, he's here. It's your dad. Hello, dad? What's up? Are you sitting in front of it? Yeah, I mean the computer. Personal calls aren't allowed. Are you at the desktop? The main menu. The first thing you see after turning it on. You're holding up the line. Yeah, go to "Start". Click the left button on the mouse and look for it... Headquarters may be trying to call! Yes. Click there. What do you mean how? The left button again! You're holding up the company line! Shut up! Hello. No, nothing's wrong, dad. We're up to our necks in work. Ready? Good. I have to hang up, dad. I don't know, I have to hang up. Bye. That was my dad. He bought a computer. I gave him this number in case he had trouble with it. He has trouble all right. Sometimes he's dead and sometimes he's disappeared. Look, Mr. Lino, what I said about my dad... It doesn't matter. I figured you'd be nicer to me if you thought I was an orphan. Just leave it alone, Nin. Why did I say that? It was stupid. Seriously, it doesn't matter. Yes! It does matter! That was your father on the phone, right? Your birth father. The same man who gave you that ridiculous name? I tried. I did my part. I put up with your tardiness, your indifference. I showed you the ropes. I let you bring that chair and sit all day. I answered your questions, no matter how impertinent they are. I try to get along with you. I try! But I won't put up with lies. There's no place for lies in this warehouse. We're done. Around here, we get down to business. That's what we're here for! There are different kinds of lies. I said we're done! No, Mr. Lino. We're not done. There are lies we tell others and lies we tell ourselves. I talked to Mr. Salvaleón's secretary. -More lies! -You want to know something? She said they don't make masts. Yeah, just as you heard. They've sold tons of flagpoles to U.S. embassies, but not a single mast in the 25 years she's been Mr. Salvaleón's secretary. Not a single mast. That's absurd, it doesn't make sense. It sure doesn't. Why would Mr. Salvaleón keep an empty warehouse? I don't know. Maybe he wants Saltamar Corporation to think he makes masts. Maybe the Government pays him, or he's laundering money, or he made a promise to his dying granny. I don't know and I don't care! The fact is that this place will never see a mast. You don't know anything. You've only been here four days. Headquarters has never placed an order. There's never been merchandise there. The unloading zone and the surplus area have been empty too. You didn't hear what Mr. Salvaleón said to me. "You are an integral part in the apparatus of this business." Today was the first time the phone rang. Enough! You think I give a damn what happens once I'm gone? No! I don't care! Let it burn for all I care! I won't come back even if Mr. Salvaleón himself asks me to! Because he's going to ask me to. He's going to beg me to return when everything starts falling apart. How could five days possibly be enough to pass on 39 years of experience to a lying, snot-nosed kid? There are no masts here! This is just a front! A front for what? So you talked to Mr. Salvaleón's secretary, right? All lies! I talk to her every day. You want me to do it? You want me to call her? MATERIAL RELEASE ORDER You know what? I don't give a damn what you think about this company. What's more, I don't give a damn about masts or this warehouse because I'm halfway out the door! Sit down. Suddenly I felt something snap. Like something breaking in two. Should I call an ambulance? No... no. I'm alright now. I'm alright. After 39 years of perfect attendance, Mr. Salvaleón will forgive me... for leaving a little early today. Will you be able to close up by yourself? It's time you started assuming your responsibility around here. Are you sure you're alright? It's possible I might be a little late tomorrow too. Mr. Lino. Don't worry. I'll clock you out at 3:00 p.m. today, and clock you in tomorrow at exactly 6:53 a.m. FRIDAY It must be about 30 feet long. It's 26. When did it get here? About 15 minutes ago. -Mr. Lino. -What's up, Nin? I unloaded it, but didn't record it in the books. There's no rush. I wasn't sure where it should go. Are they going to fetch it? I don't think so. Then it goes in returns. It doesn't look defective, does it? Then, it belongs in non-defective, surplus merchandise. Third book. I should have been here. Never mind. It got here, and here it is. That's how it goes. Sometimes there's nothing to do, and other times there is a lot of work to do. Like at any job. Right, Nin? That's right, like at any job. What are you doing here? Are you lost, or are you a scout? Christopher Columbus was quite lost until he discovered America. Maybe you have to get a little lost in order to find something. Listen, listen up! What's the point of all this coming and going? Right. You have to feed the offspring. You must grow your colony, with its ventilation systems and everything. But, then what? What are you trying to accomplish? You already weigh more than we do. It was you, wasn't it? What about me? You brought it. Why would you think that? Because it's the first one to arrive in 39 years. Actually, it's the first one I've ever seen. Well, I've seen them on television, but those are always attached to a boat. It doesn't make much sense, a mast without a boat holding it up. By itself, it's just an aluminum rod. Do you want to know how it got here? Yesterday I made a call after you left. -Did you use the company phone? -It was an internal call. I called the Sales Department. "Hello, miss. This is Mr. Blackmoon's personal secretary. We'd like to place an order. I know it hasn't been three years yet." There's one year to go. "We want to order a mast for the Ambassador's private boat." She says the company doesn't make masts. "Isn't the company name Salvaleón Aluminum Masts and Flagpoles? Why would it say masts if you don't make them? Let me be frank with you, miss. Mr. Blackmoon chose your company to replace the flagpoles because he thought you would throw in a mast for his sailboat. If you guys can't get your shit together, we'll have to order all our masts from Saltamar!" Sure enough, Salvaleón bought a mast from Saltamar. They're probably calling the U.S. Embassy, begging them for their continued faith in the company. What now? What do you mean? It doesn't make sense for either of us to continue working here. It doesn't make sense for you to continue, but I'm staying on. You must be joking! I searched for a job for two years, I'm not going to lose this one. But this job doesn't exist. It's not that different from any other job, really. No trucks are ever going to come, Nin. Never. I know that. Go away, Mr. Lino. Your work here is done. But you're an intelligent young man, with initiative. You brought your own chair on your second day! What will you do here all alone for eight hours every day? If I didn't spend them here, I'd spend them somewhere else. A man's got to make a living. -But this job doesn't exist. -This job is a mistake. A meaningless post, I don't care. There's a contract and a salary. It's shitty, but it's a salary. I don't get you, Nin. That's how it goes. If it's not too much of a bother, Nin, I'd like to complete my shift. After all, I'm still an employee. No. Stay there. You've earned that chair. I was thinking. If you don't mind, Nin... I could come in on Monday. Not all morning, of course. Just a couple of hours. To help out, should you need anything. I don't know, they sang horribly.
