As the old story goes... The great martial arts masters, His Kung fu only accounted for 20 percent of his skill, while fame makes the other 80 percent. I don't believe that. Only if your Kung fu is good can you become famous. When I make a punch, it will be either vertical or horizontal. If I lose my fame, I would... do anything to be a Kung Fu winner. What is his name? Qi. Finally... Huang Feihong. I will beat you down! Su. Why hasn't she arrived? Su. What are these words on the board? Master. They're English words. 13th aunt taught me before she left here. AUNTY Means Yi in Chinese. 13th means thirteen. So, it means 13th aunt. AUNTY. Means Yi. 13th aunty... It should read like Yi Shisan. No no no... Master. You're wrong. With English names, you should read the last words first. Your Chinese still isn't so good. You want to speak English. Now you're teaching me. Is that what I taught you? I sent Kuan to find a carriage. What's taking so long? Where is he? Oh no. He can't be causing trouble again. What are you doing? You want to steal my job? Get away! No need to shout. Get up. Get up. Get up! Nowadays, even a beggar has to learn some Kung fu to survive. Hey. What are you doing? Oh, I get it. You want to make trouble for me. Do you know who I am? Have you heard about Liang Kuan? All right. Just lie here if you want. Wait here. I'm so lucky. It wasn't mine. Let's go! You jackass! After you. Thank you for sponsoring the ring. This will help bring Chinese and British associations together, and stop the fighting between Hupei and Kwangtung associations. Win-win! Hey... You beggar. You. Get out of the way. When did begging get so dangerous? Sometimes, in dealing with the Chinese, the most effective way is to use our British weapons. Right? I'm going to the dock. Do you want to share my carriage with me? Please. Master, 13th aunt. 13th aunt. Here! Feihong. Feihong. Feihong. This is my schoolmate in Britain. James. You're Huang Feihong. Great meeting you. Hi Mes Ja. What? I should read the last words first, shouldn't I? Mr.Wong is funny. I should leave you people alone. That's right, Feihong. James is also a doctor. He majored in western medicine in college. Western medicine. They like to cut people's skin and put nails in their veins. Kind of true. But traditional Chinese medicine also has acupuncture treatment. And I'd be glad to see that, if possible. Okay. If possible, I will do it for you. Thanks a lot. 013th aunt, is that what you brought from England? Oh yeah. Feihong. I brought it back. Can you take me home with it? Well... Kuan got us a carriage. I can ride it later. Shaojun. Your nephew doesn't know how to ride a bike. Maybe I can give you a ride. It's just a bike. Of course we can ride. Su. Master. I... Get on it. Shaojun. Let's go. Good Good Good-bye. The Fu cargo has always been unloaded by the Cantonese association. What do you want? I don't care who used to unload them. But from here on out, we'll take the job. You're making trouble. Making trouble? I'll even make a fight! What are you doing? Liang Kuan. It's not your business. Get lost! Why I should get lost? What does this have to do with you? This is only between Hupei and Kwangtung associations, Let me tell you. I... am also from Kwangtung. Get him! Not bad. Well, it seems you know how to be afraid. Kuan. Didn't your master tell you not to fight? You're wrong. My master only told me not to fight without a reason. Listen to me. If you dare bully people again, I will... Who is it? You don't want your life, do you? How dare you to pull my hair Ouch! Master, help! Master! Minister. Please, let him go. You're Huang Feihong? You must be Minister Duan. I just arrived. But your apprentice is causing trouble here. Are you challenging me? Master, he's lying! They started it. Stop talking! I... Did you all forget what I've taught you? Minister. I... I want to apologize for the mistakes they've made. Please forgive them Just this once. Okay. Get them! Wait! Please. Master Wong. You're friends with the British Embassy. If so, I can let them go. Leave. James. Thank you! Feihong. Say thank you. Kuan. Yes. Where is the carriage? It's there. Feihong Feihong 13th aunt You're home. Brother. Kuan. What now? Look at yourself. 13th aunt... Yes. You finally got back. Is everything all right? Yes. I want to ask you something. What do you think... of my song, Feihong? What do you mean, brother? What about him? As a man. Brother. I... I... I haven't... yet. How... Why are you so open-minded? I'm a little tired. See you later. I'll just go, too. What... What's wrong with my words? I just wanted to know what she thinks of Feihong. Feihong Why didn't you talk to on the way back? Do you know what you did wrong? Master. It's really not my fault. You saw how hard they hit us. They started it. Feihong. Hand-kissing is just a normal greeting in Britain. Could you not be angry? Stop finding excuses. Can't you learn anything decent? Ouch! Master, I'm sorry. All right. It's all my fault! Will you still do that? No, I won't. I Promise! If you don't like it, I won't do it anymore. Come on! Feihong. Remember you asked me to get you some herbs from Britain? I forgot. How could you forget? Didn't you listen to me? Finally! You can talk. I brought the herbs back. Here. What about... I taught you Kung Fu, but I didn't teach you to fight people. The most important thing in Kung Fu is endurance. You know that, right? Go. I'll go now, master. Feihong What did your father say about us getting married? Well... I.. Did you father say no? No. No he didn't. It's just.. What? It's just.. He said getting married is a big deal. We can't rush it. We need to find a lucky day, you and me. Oh. Feihong. I've missed you so much. Go away. What are you two looking at? What brings you here? Where is Feihong? Well, Where is master? Master is here. You can't go in there! Move! Don't... Don't... Great master... Great master... Feihong Dad Why are you here? 13th Aunt has just arrived Why did you make her do that? You're not considerate at all. No wonder you're still single. Dad. This... 13th Aunt Go change your clothes, since you've come back. You see, the foreign clothes you were wearing... It seems a little weird. Okay. Dad Is there a problem? Come with me. Something happened in the lobby. Master What is it? The ring is now occupied by the Hupei Association. We wanted to challenge them, but we all got injured. So we can't work tomorrow. What ring? It was for commerce associations. Mainly for Kwangtung and Hupei. If someone wins the fight, He can do long-term business with the British association. The association also has a rule-- If we beat them down, We can be foremen and get more money. So, we went up. In martial arts, you should know when to stop. But you... Why play so hard? It wasn't us! They were much harder than us. And... they've got a monster. What? Qi, their monster. Qi. What? You knew him? Of course I knew him. He went here to challenge master three times. But he never won. That's him. You became this because of him? Yes. What a shame. Don't tell the others we trained together. His foot Kung Fu is truly great. But how could he hurt you so badly? Master. You didn't see it. His feet... They're like... Shut up! I always taught you to keep the peace. But you didn't remember a word. We are from Po Chi Lam. How can we fight people? No, master, we didn't. When they heard we're from Po Chi Lam, they fought even harder. They said, if we fight against Hu Pei association, We're all dead. Oh my... Master. They were challenging us. Forget it. Anyway. Don't fight them anymore. Try to be more tolerant. Really? Master. How can we put up with this? What do you want? I'd say... we should fight back. At the least, we can make them pay. Fine. Go. I'm ready, master. If you go, your legs will be broken. By them, or by me. I... I am... I am going to close the door. Why is this door open? Here, let me say it again. We're from Po Chi Lam. If anyone of you dares start a fight, I'll make you regret it. Feihong. I think he's right. If they did it on purpose... Dad. In Kung Fu, patience is important. You told me that. That's right. But these are your apprentices. Even if we want peace, and don't want to fight, we should at least protect our apprentices. And it's... Dad. I've got this. I know what's happening. Just trust me. Bro... Da... Dad. You want Diedajiu? 13th aunt. You've traveled such a long way. You must be tired. Let's get you some rest. Dad? Was she calling me? Kuan, you have to promise me that you won't get on that stage. Kick him! Kuan, if you don't listen to me, I will tell master. I know. Just watch. Kick him! Go on! Excellent! Amazing! Who's next? I thought you Cantonese were supposed to be good. Are you? Prove it to me. You losers. In my view... you'd better go home. Kuan, I can't stand him anymore. He needs to be punched in the face. What do you say? What do I say? I say you stay here. And I say to him there, you shut your mouth. Let me teach you something. Aren't you great? Come on! Keep going. Do you want to see more? This Liang Kuan can do some kind of Kung Fu. Liang Kuan? He's nothing. But his master, Wong Feihong... is a famous master in Guangzhou. Wong Feihong. I heard he's a good doctor. How can we see him? It's easy. When his apprentice gets beaten, his master... will definitely come. Let me tell you. You are really lucky! Meeting me today. You know that? Get lost! Let me show you what Kung Fu is. Come on. Anyone? Come on. Qi Man. Do you want to kill me? We truly are native enemies. Tell me-- Did you hurt my apprentice? Come on. Are you playing dumb? How did he get so good? It's a secret. Qi Man. Don't you want to keep your life? Qi Man. He is Wong Feihong. Why do you want to kill me in the arena? Qi Man, I don't want to fight you. Stop, Qi Man. Qi Man. Good! Master. You're next. Thank you so much for bringing us honor. I'm flattered. I came here only to bring my apprentice back. I don't want... to be involved in any fights. So. I can't take these compliments. My apprentice did the wrong thing. I'm his master. I want to apologize for his wrongdoing. Maybe our two associations can work together in peace. Everyone here... I suggest we all stop fighting. Kuan. Master, I'm here. I'm here. Hey you! Pretty arrogant, weren't you? Keep doing that. Kuan. Take Qi back. Master. He wanted to kill me. Just do what I said. Feihong. Aren't you a monster? Get up. Fight me. Let's go. It happened hours before. There are still strong drugs in his body. It's so weird. Master. He almost got Kuan killed. Why did you save him? It wasn't all his fault. Think about him in the ring. He seemed to be controlled by drugs. And, he's from Hupei association. If we can cure him, they may blame us less. Right. His legs were broken. Maybe... Maybe he will become disabled. Stop. I'm going to practice deep knee bends. What are you doing here? Well, I asked to help with his wound. The treatment you gave him. Is that right? You think I can't cure him. So you asked him? To be honest, I don't believe in western medicine. Why? Dr.James, Do you have any solutions? Even Chopin can't play it. There is nothing we can do. Master Wong, what about you? James. His legs are broken. I heard that western surgeons are quite good. Can you help us? I got this. He needs surgery. If we successfully reset his leg bones, he'll walk normally again. But, we must do it quickly. Take him to my hospital tomorrow morning. Okay. Feihong... Feihong... Okay. But-- I need to be there. Okay. Send someone to kill Qi. What are they talking about? They're doctors. They must be discussing the operation. Why do they keep looking at us? Here's the operating room. People aren't allowed in here. We could distract them. We're going to do the bone surgery. Mr.Wong is also a doctor. It's okay. You guys stay here. Chinese doctor. Please don't mind his words. They don't recognize traditional Chinese medicine that much. Kuan. Was this place a refuge once? How did it became a hospital? So the foreign people did do something. Let's have a look. Kuan. It's a hospital. We'd better stay, in case we get infected. Master brought us here. He wanted us to learn more. To see new things. Let's go. Kuan. Come on, let's go. Who... Again? You jackass. Are you doing this on purpose? No, don't get me wrong. You want to get hit? Chinese doctor. Come here! It was just an accident. What? Do you want to beat me? Only with this little needle? Well, small needle? Tell him what it is. James' lab. It's a syringe. They will inject it into your veins. Are you scared now? Yes. That's right. You really think I am? You should ask around about who I am. Who are you? The No.1 beggar in Causeway Bay Hutong. They call me Ace of beggars. What is that? Acid. Right. Muriatic acid. What is acid? Your heart's acid. I don't understand. Kuan, Kuan. What? Qi, be careful with your legs. Qi. Wong Feihong Don't play like you're a good man. The doctor has just given you the pills. You have to stay here. Master Watch out! Another monster. Qi. Leave me alone. Feihong. Just go! Qi, go! They're here to kill you. No! I don't want to owe you anything. Master-- You don't have to that for him. Qi. Why... Why... Why... Why... Why... I just wanted to beat you. Why... Why... Fei... You're reading an English book. Give me that. No. You can get your own. You'd better hide it well. It's dark. How did you find me? I'm a doctor. I can see things. I'm also good at hearing things. Give me that book. No way. Is it that good, being a master? Sure. Can I be a master? Yes. If I become a master, I'll also find an aunt. No. I will find hundreds of aunts. Thousands! Aunts. Aunts aunts aunts... Can't you say anything else? Are you opening a martial arts school or a whorehouse? You know nothing. This is called... It's a pleasure to die in a woman's arms. Just go away. Go. Wong Feihong. I win. You said you'd told dad about us. Did he? Did he? Choose our wedding day? He said... Maybe later. Later... No matter what, We have to be married by next spring. What? Why the rush? Because... I want our baby to be a Pisces. Look at you. Britain really changed you. You forgot everything. Only mandarins are called couples. Fish... Let's just say two fish. But... How can people give birth to fish? It's called a horoscope. They match up with groups of stars Like the foreign version of animal signs. Maybe you should learn some foreign culture. It's just something about the stars. I knew it. In China, we also have that kind of thing. Like... But... Pisces... I really haven't heard about it. I don't care. Our baby has to be a Pisces or Gemini. They have to choose one of them. What is Gemini? See? Master got scolded, too. Folk master's room is here. Master's is over there. When cleaning Po Chi Lam tomorrow... Stop! Master. I'm so sorry! I... You can't even do deep knee bends well. No wonder you got punched. Master-- The horoscope is like the almanac abroad. You must hurry if you want a Pisces baby That's right, master. Think about it. If you two don't make it in time, your baby can only be a Leo. Or an Aquarius... Just stand in this posture. Hold it for at least ten hours, or I'll have your legs broken. Master... Master... Go, go, go. Shaojun. Shaojun. Oh... No, I saw you. Did you think we were making fun? Wow, you can fight now. Right? It's getting better. Except my body has been limp. Hey-- The other day, your kicks in the ring were impressive. Could you teach us? The ring? What are you talking about? Come on. Don't be so modest! You were like this... I don't know why, but about the other day... My memory is just a blur. Let me try. Right. Brown, that British man. He told me in the lab That medicine could make me stronger. So I agreed to get injected. That reminds me-- Master told me that a powerful medicine was still affecting Qi's body. Such medicine actually exists. How about we steal that medicine? If we're injected with that, we won't have to practice deep knee bends But that medicine is dangerous. Those people who got injected with me all had spasms. It's like being bitten by bugs. Then they died-- In that ring. Who were those people I fought? And... My leg. Feels like being pinched. There's been a lot of swelling. Oh. Su, come here. I have something to say. There is something I want to tell you. How about we sneak in there and steal that medicine? What do you say? You don't care, once you get on shore. It's not like that. I want to do this because I care. All right? Master always punished you with deep knee bends. Aren't you tired? You have my word. As long as we get that medicine, and cure this leg, We'll make amends for our stealing. It's like killing two birds with one stone. No. I could do this by myself. But there was English on the lab's equipment. I can't read it. Su. Look at me. You have to know how much you mean to me. You are my guide. I need you. Come on. Think about it. Master doesn't want you to study English now. But when you get to that lab, you'll read the English words on those bottles. So we can find that medicine and cure him. Then Master will support you studying English. All right. I will come with you. I can't say no to this. What are you guys talking about? Do you remember where... Brown's lab was? The lab... It's right behind the ring. Why are you interested in that? Dude. Arrange a nice dinner with good wine. You're going to treat us. Let's go. Why? Mr. Brown. Qi is still alive. It's your fault. I'm very sorry. I'll experiment on your people this time as punishment. Don't let me down. I understand. My glasses... This time, I'll be your guide. Brother Kuan... Brother Kuan. It's a film projector. Come on, 13th aunt has shown it to us. Su. Isn't it interesting? I've been thinking why I brought you here. Go find it. That red potion. Brother Kuan, I found the red potion. Don't touch that button. Oh my... Run! Master Huang. Please stand up. This is my fault. I got Kuan and Su in trouble. Please punish me. It's clear now... They intend to force me to accept this challenge. You don't want to go? No. I do not. I study Kung Fu not to defeat others, And certainly not to fighting for a championship. Feihong. Why can't you understand such simple logic? The greatest warriors fight for their nation and people. Kung Fu training is certainly not for defeating others. But if our nation is in danger and our people are being bullied As a warrior, how can we stand aside? But... "A man must know his strengths and what is the right thing to do" It's honorable, sticking to your personal principles. But if you stick to the wrong ones, you're just being stubborn. Think about it. Master. Master came to rescue us. Master. Master. Master. If you win this battle, you can take them. If you lose, you're at my disposal. Do you dare sign it? Master, don't sign it. Master, don't. Master! The adventure waiver. I'll sign it. Master, you cannot sign it. You have some guts. Who is coming? Shaojun. Brother Kuan... I must be sick, brother Kuan. I'm seeing things. I just saw two foreign chicks coming to the ring. It's not an illusion. There are two English chicks. I think we're saved. What are you thinking? Don't you know? Master would never fight women! We're doomed this time. Look. Look! Su. Master would never beat a woman. Look at those half-naked women. Even I can't bear to beat them up, let alone the Master. Feihong. You can take your eyes off them. Shaojun. I don't want to look at them either, but they're equipped with swords. Do you remember what we did when the light was off that night? Aunt Thirteen is quite open-minded. You can use that to manage them. I see. Su, master used the umbrella's stick. Foreign chicks also use sticks. Is this the legendary stick-boxing? 13th aunt. I'm sure of this... Those girls have taken that medicine. What? You mean the medicine you were injected with? Yes. After they injected me, they used that whistle to control me. And train me. Take me to their lab. We can steal that medicine. Let's go. The lab is empty now. Hurry. Let's go. It stinks. Where's that smell coming from? Those are their experimental objects. Let's go. How's it coming? Where is the medicine? 13th aunt. I found it. Let's go. Film projector. What's this? This is the evidence of the English's crime. I need to take this. Shaojun. James. Why are you here? I followed you here. What are you doing here? Can't you see there are dead bodies outside? Look at this. The Asian race-change program mutated into a war machine. What's that smell? This is a dangerous gas. It's harmful to the body. Let's get out of here. Hurry. I have to take this with me. That's great, master. Too bad for the girls. Damn it. Master. What you did was awesome. When we come to small fights like this in the future, you can let me handle it. Master. Feihong. We found the medicine in Brown's lab. It's a matter of great importance. Let's go home first. Let's go. Okay. Come on. Please make contact with the Embassy. Why is he here? He... Master. How about I take those foreign chicks home? Master. Master, we can just leave them here. Wait for me, master. So. Brown's business is just a cover. He's actually doing experiments in Kwangtung They called it the Asian race-change program. They've been collecting Chinese genes extensively to make genetically modified medicine. Then they use it to train loyal war machines. Thus, Qi, The two pretty girls, and those dead bodies... are all just his experimental objects. It's true. Furthermore, I assume Their medicine is still in trials. It seems that an overseas education can be quite helpful. Dad. What do you think of it? 13th aunt. What do you mean? Qi still hasn't had a full recovery. Is there an antidote? I don't know. I want to try this medicine myself. No, no, no, no. Master. Don't. You are the pillar of our Po Chi Lam If this medicine is bad, we'll lose our master. That makes sense. Kuan really cares about me. Then you are going to experience this. Ah. Master Wong Kuan got this medicine for me. Let me take it. No. Kuan, this is it. You have to get back all the leaked evidence. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Okay, good. Otherwise, death is the only way out. Yes, sir. I know who can fix this. Don't worry. Kill them. Of course. 13th aunt. Let's do it. Kuan. For me. This is my first time doing this. It might hurt. You can divert your attention to something else. It won't take long. Kuan. Hold on. It hurts. Master, it hurts. Shaojun. Do you remember the anesthetic I asked you to bring home? According to the medicine book, Acupuncture can offset the effects of... anesthetic. I think... This medicine has something in common with anesthetic. Since it is caused by a drug, then, there must be an antidote. Maybe acupuncture. Provincial military commander. Send for Wong Feihong. What for? You'll know when you meet the commander. Master Huang. We just follow orders. Forgive me. It seems the commander already knows. What happened in the ring? Good timing. When I go to the commander's office, I can show the medicine to commander Duan. Master, please reconsider. Qi. Feihong. I will come with you. There's no need. Commander Duan won't give me a hard time. You can relax. Master. Master. I will go to James' medical base To find out what this is. There might be an antidote. I will go with you, aunt Thirteen. No. If Feihong gets back before me, do not tell him where I am. In case he's overthinking things. Okay. Okay, okay. Shaojun, why are you here? It's strange today. Why are there no patients? I went to the embassy to report what's been happening in Brown's lab. Brown then sent an army to close this medical base. I am so sorry. It's all because of me. Did you come here just to see me? I... I know. You must have come for Wong Feihong. Not exactly. Um... I... We found this. Could you test it? Commander. Commander. Wong Feihong. Ganged up with your disciples. Committing theft and arson in the ring's warehouse. Is that true? Commander. There must be some misunderstanding. Please listen to me. How can a warrior like you understand the conflict between English business and Kwangtung? Commander. Brown has been plotting a scheme. The contest is just a cover. I personally arranged this contest. You're just deliberately against me. But the contest is the cause of the contradiction. Holding a contest is a bad strategy. Nonsense. Commander. The chairmen of the associations in Kwangtung and Hupei are here to see you. Commander Please forgive my bold behavior. I invited those two chamber chairmen on your behalf, to discuss what is going on in this contest. Please listen to what I have to say. If there is any problem, I am at your disposal. Okay. Show me. So are there any results? The composition of this medicine is very complex. Except for its neural-paralysis effect. It contains substantial polyphenol-peptide virus. After taking that, people will be high continuously. While it takes some time, regenerative cells will mutate. There will be a huge increase in the body's physical strength. Why not? Taking a look? Wong Feihong. What are we gathered here for? Hupei-Kwangtung association was set up in 1824. It was one united chamber. For over thirty years, until 1868, It officially divided into two chambers. There were five chairmen over the last five years. There were conflicts. Relations have never been worse than today. In the past, we valued the principle that peace creates money. But today. our chambers are competing in this contest. I think all this... got started when English businessmen got involved. Ever since the English came to Kwangtung. They began to create a monopoly. They also made secret plans to force trade prices up, and manipulate the officials to make secret contracts. That resulted in even deeper grudges between the two chambers. That's why we're in this position. If our Chinese people do not unite, Fast boats and powerful cannons... even a bundle of cotton, or a boxful of tea in the wharf can break us down. If two chairmen Make common trade policies with English men Do not fight against each other. That will be best for the chambers. Commander. The court policy is to control western countries by learning from them. But these foreigners are no fools. They performed experiments on our Chinese people, injecting medicine into us, trying to convert Chinese people into their war machines. Using Chinese to rule Chinese. Isn't that much more dangerous than opium? Brown is the original culprit. I, Huang Feihong... I am a warrior. I am asking you. Please, come to your senses. Do not fall into their trap. About the potion-- What Huang Feihong said is true. Those... Fools. Our country has ceded territory and yielded power Just feeding your greedy mouths. You only want safety. But our English people have a long-term plan. Can't you understand? Listen. I, Duan Tianci, As long as I am commander in Kwangtung, I will not let you have your way. Shaojun. Yes. Do you remember what I told you in Britain? I think we are... connected. Both in culture and world outlook. James. You are a good man. But... Huang Feihong is my fiancÃ©e. Are... Are you sure this is what you want with your life? James. You are special to me. I admire you. But... While I stand here looking at you working, what first came to my mind is Feihong. It is possible... I've developed a Westernized mind? But. My soul is still Chinese. Please wait a moment. Su. Su What? Come look at this needle. Needle? Brother. Do you think I can actually see without my glasses? You can come closer. Look at it. Come on. What's on it? James' lab. What does it mean? It's James' lab. Lab... Why is this familiar to me? Yes. I know. Do you remember the needle that stabbed my butt in the garden? Yes, I do. Hey. Is this? I use it to pick my teeth, since it's sharp. Let me see it, brother Qi. I can't move. Give it to me. They are the same. One is James' lab. The other is Brown's lab. Crap. 13th aunt is in danger. Catch her. Do not come any closer. Shoajun. Don't come over here! Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen. Don't panic. Listen. James. Who are you? Don't move. Give it to me. Let me go. Where are you going? Master. 13th aunt is in danger. 13th aunt. What happened? What happened to her? She went to James' lab. James is as bad as Brown. Feihong. 13th is going to see... Let it be. Dad. 13th aunt. 13th aunt is your daughter-in-law. Qi, you go first. Feihong. Feihong. If anyone harms my daughter-in-law, beat him to death. Huang Feihong. Do you know why a small country like Britain can be the most powerful country in the world? You mean steam engines or scientific knowledge? That's just superficial. The real reason Is that Britain is prepared for danger in peaceful times. We're expanding, absorbing other cultures... to keep our people surviving in this world. We are not like the Chinese. You have vast lands, rich resources. But you are short-sighted. That's why you're invading other nations. Invading? This isn't invading. It's guiding. You need the guidance of the British Empire. Now you feel like you're being invaded. But, after hundreds of years, you will thank us. Since ancient times, strength means everything. But it doesn't mean that great powers can invade other countries as they like. Huang Feihong. You are still such a stubborn man. I just can't understand why aunt Thirteen has such affection for you. Shaojun. Where is she? You want to know where she is, you'll have to defeat me first. I know you're not a decent man. The first time I saw you, you wanted to compete with my master. You really are flattering yourself. Find aunt Thirteen. I'll stay here. Go. Okay. What do we do?
