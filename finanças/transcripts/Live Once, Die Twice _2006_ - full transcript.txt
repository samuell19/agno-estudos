[ Machinery ] - OK, come on. [ Buzzer ] Hands up. Go ahead. [ Sighing ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Chuckling ] - I love you. - I love you. [ Sighing ] - Mmm... Well, that's one hell of an argument for me to let you keep travelling for work. - I was trying to make an argument against travelling for work. - Well then, I have one word for you: "overkill." [ Laughing ] - You know, I better get going. You know how George is about the annual fishing trip. - Maybe I'll go with you. - I don't know if that's a very good idea. You know, it's kind of a guy thing. - I meant to the dock. I'm not gonna set foot on that boat. Testosterone alone would put hair on my chest. - Mmm. We wouldn't want that? - No. No. [ Horn honking ] - Good morning, Evan. - Hey, hey! - How was your beauty sleep? - I've had better. - You're giving it all to your beautiful wife. - You're right. - Good morning, Nicole. - Good morning, George. - Let's grab some gak! [ Grunting ] [ Grunting ] - Oh, damn! What did you pack for lunch, lead? - You know better than that. We drink our lunch on these trips. - Yeah, and our dinner too. [ Laughing ] - And our dinner too. - Some fishing trip! Did anyone bring bait? - Bait... [ Cellular ringing ] Yeah? Ah, you're kidding me! - What is it, work? - What happened? Are you all right? Well, you want us to wait for you? OK, OK. All right. Bye. - What is it? What happened? - Dan got in an accident coming off the expressway. - Is he hurt? - No, he's fine. Just a couple stitches, but he's stuck at the hospital. Dan's not gonna make it. - So? More fish for us. - Hey, sweetie, don't let it spoil your trip. George is right. Just look at the bright side. More beer too. [ Chuckling ] - How did I get so lucky with you, huh? - You know how to travel. - I'll miss you. - Come on. What are you talking about? It's 3 days. - Yeah, I know it's 3 days. But I'm still gonna miss you. - I love you. - I love you. - Have fun. - I will. - Bye. - OK. [ Sighing ] [ Motor starting ] - It was weird. When you add up all the time he travels for work, I only ever see him half the year anyway. He kissed me like he was saying goodbye for a month. - We have 3 days to cut loose and have some fun. I say we take the ferry to Fire Island, maybe swing by the Pines, level out the playing field. - The Pines? I would rather spend my night trying to look 10 years younger in Hampton Bay. - Ooh! Hampton Bay! Young college boys looking for seasoned pros! I like the way you think. - Lucy! You make us sound like a bunch of hookers. - What is a hooker but a woman who sleeps with someone of her own choosing? - Well, I choose my husband. Thank you. - I respect that. But I'm single. I want to make my own choices. What do you say? A couple drinks, we see what nibbles, you're home for hardball. - I don't think so. I've got a hot date with Sunday's crossword puzzle. [ Sighing ] [ Rain pattering on roof ] [ Thunder ] [ Thunder ] [ Thunder ] [ Speed dialling ] [ Line ringing ] [ Cellular ringing ] Come on, Evan. [ Ringing ] [ Loud thunder clap ] [ Sighing ] [ Doorbell ringing ] [ Doorbell ] [ Knocking ] [ Loud knocking ] [ Doorbell twice ] Sid, come in! - Sorry to wake you, Nicole. - What is it? What's wrong? - There's been an accident. - Oh my God! It's Evan. - A trawler came across some... some debris from the boat a few miles out to sea, due east. It looks like Evan's. - Is he dead? - They're gonna ask you for a DNA sample. - I'm Agent Carter with the FBI. This is Agent Wayne Bolton. Let us first extend our condolences for the apparent death of your husband. We know this is uncomfortable for you, but we have to ask you some questions. - I don't understand why the FBI is here. - There wasn't much left to the boat, Nicole. The FBI doesn't think it was an accident. - The debris isn't proportionately consistent with the magnitude of an explosion created by a boat of that size. - An explosion? - Yes, and judging by the debris, a big one. Too big for the fuel the boat was carrying. It's the kind of thing we see associated with drugs. - Evan wasn't involved with drugs. - No one's saying he is. Do you know if anybody else was on the boat with your husband? - Yes, George Babich. - What can you tell us about him? - Um... nothing really. He was a friend of Evan's. They went fishing together. - How long did you know him? - I didn't know him long. I only met him twice. - Was he a close friend of your husband's? - They were fishing buddies. - So it was just the two of them on a fishing trip? - Yes. There was another man who was supposed to be there, but he had an accident on the way. His name was Dan. He was a friend of George's. - Do you remember his last name? - No, I'm sorry. I never met him. - Had he gone fishing with your husband before? - No. - You sound pretty certain. - My husband told me where he was going and who he was going with, OK? We didn't have secrets. - Please. We're almost done. Your husband travelled a lot for work. Was he out of the country much? - Why are you asking me that? - At this point, we're investigating a murder, Mrs. Lauker. And the victims appear to be George Babich and your husband. Do you know anybody who would want to see your husband dead? - Absolutely not. - Are you certain? - Everybody loved Evan as long as I knew him. - How long is that? - Three years! Three years. - What's your take on her, Wayne? - I'm not sure. She seems distraught, but something about her feels guarded. - Yeah, I got that too. She's smart, though. Too smart to be duped for 3 years. - You think she's a player? - I'm not ready to say that. - Beachfront property, swanky boat... He must have been one hell of a salesman. [ Sighing ] [ Sighing ] - Oh God! [ Knocking on door ] [ Knocking ] - Nicole? Nicole? Nicole? I just found out. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's OK. - I can't imagine why anyone would want to see Evan dead. - Impossible. He didn't have an enemy in the world. - The FBI thinks he might have been involved in some kind of drug trafficking. - What? Hey, listen to me. These guys will twist things around to make it fit whatever agenda they have. Don't let them shake your faith in Evan. You know more than they do the kind of man you married. - Mrs. Lauker. - What do you want? - We need to talk. - Wait--wait a minute. How can that be? - The DNA samples of the remains were of 2 males. We have a positive match on a George Babich, but the other one is unknown. It's not your husband. - Are you saying Evan is still alive? - I'm saying Evan Lauker was not on the boat at the time of the explosion. - Mrs. Lauker, were you and your husband having marital problems? - What? No! We weren't having any problems. - I know this is hard for you. We're just trying to get to the bottom of what happened. [ Phone ringing ] - Excuse me. - She's gotta know more than she's letting on. - Let's get the search warrant. My gut tells me she married a player and he set her up to disappear. The question is why. - Sorry. - Nicole, one of the possibilities we have to consider is that your husband faked his own death. - To get away from me? I would have known if he had wanted to get away from me. - We spoke to his boss, Mike Harney. He said that Evan was his top salesman for the first 3 years, then seemed to lose interest the last two. - That is not true. In fact, Evan travelled more this last year then he ever has. It's how we could afford our boat. - Really? Well, according to Mr. Harney, your husband's expense account was cut because he wasn't travelling at all. [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? - Nicole Lauker? - Yes, who is this? - My name's Dugan. I was supposed to be on that boat with your husband. - You're Dan. You were in the car accident. - There's a club in Islip on Mendoza Street, the Sand Chest. Be at the bar in one hour. - But wait a second. I don't even know you. Why should I trust you? - That was no accident on your husband's boat. Somebody killed them. You're next if they don't get their money. - What money? Do you know who's trying to kill Evan? - Just meet me at the bar. And come alone. ♪ Loud rock ♪♪ You get so close♪ ♪ We move so well♪ ♪ You really got me hypnotized♪ ♪ You look so good♪ ♪ And you get me just right♪ ♪ So won't you please stay by my side...♪ Nicole Lauker? - You're Dugan? - Have a seat. ♪ So, Lady Tease, come make my dreams♪ ♪ So, Lady Tease...♪♪ You look uncomfortable. - Not my kind of place. - This is where Evan and I met when we did our business. - I can't imagine Evan coming to a place like this. - You didn't know him very well, did you? Want a martini? - Why am I here? - Two martinis. Do you know what platinum is? - It's a metal used to make jewellery. - It's rarer than gold and worth almost twice as much. Evan was the fence for our operation. I was the bag man. George was the supplier. George worked as a platinum melter in a refinery in Chester County. He'd scrape away shards of raw platinum and secretly melt them down into small bars. It was my job to smuggle them through the metal detectors and deliver them to Evan. We did it for 2 years. Thousands of ounces. Evan had a buyer at 500 bucks an ounce. - Well, where's the money? I never saw any of it. - That's between you and Evan. I blew all mine in joints like this. But that last boat trip was going to be our biggest score yet. Evan said he could get a better price if we had more to bargain with, so we stockpiled. There was so much platinum on that boat, I'm surprised it didn't sink at the dock. - Oh, damn! What did you pack for lunch, lead? - Over $5 million in precious metal. What did the police tell ya? - Uh, they think the accident was drug related. - There were no drugs involved. Evan sold this stuff to a guy in Philly. But I know for a fact he'd been talking lately with a guy in Detroit. I've a feeling Evan tried to rip off his usual client and he paid the price for it. - I can't hear any more of this. - You're in this now. Whoever killed Evan won't assume you know nothing. They'll think you know where the money is. You need to disappear just like I do, and it takes lots of cash. You better find the money before they take you on a boat ride. - There isn't any money! - Then why is Evan dead? I'm not the bad guy here, Nicole. You look like a pretty smart girl to me. You better find that money before they find you. - It's a credit card I never knew about. - Maybe it was for work. - I called for the most recent activity. It was used yesterday. - Is it possible someone found it after the accident? - I went through our tax returns, and his travelling expenses are consistent, except for the last two years. And then there's nothing spent on hotels. How do you take a business trip without staying at a hotel? - I don't know. - Oh my God! - What? - It's the man I met last night. - The victim's body was found in the trunk of his car, mutilated and decapitated. The police are saying this unusually grisly murder may be drug related. In other news-- [ Turns off TV ] - You really need to call the FBI. - June 14, meeting with Luke Ravena. [ Clicking ] Luke Ravena... That's a lot of trips to Detroit. [ Beeping ] [ Static ] [ Screaming ] [ Gasping ] - How are you feeling? - Scared. - Good. It shows your instincts are sharp. Now... where is the money? - I don't know anything about any money. - This is not true, is it? You did have a discussion with Mr. Dugan last night. I know he enlightened you. My associate had a little talk with him also. In this very room. - This is about my husband. - This is about $5 million. - I told Dugan I don't know anything about this money. My husband sells commercial real estate-- - Your husband made a deal with my employer. That means you either find your husband or you find the money. You have one week. - I am telling you! I don't know anything about this! I--I don't have the money! And as far as I know my husband is dead! - Then I suggest you get busy. Just fill in the blanks like you do the Sunday crossword puzzle. If you go to the police... if you try to disappear... I'll pay a visit to your mother in, uh, Cape May, is it? Then to your sister in Wilmington, North Carolina. One week. [ Exhaling ] [ Sobbing ] [ Cutting rope ] [ Panting ] - Operator 911. - Nothing to be scared about. You never even have to look at it again, all right? God forbid, something happens while I'm out of town, then you know where it is. - Luke Ravena. Detroit, Michigan. [ Engine starting ] I have a huge favour to ask you. - I really think you should let the FBI handle this, Nicole. - The FBI thinks I was somehow involved. Besides, the FBI can't help me. Lucy, I was with the men who killed Dugan. I saw where they killed him. If I don't find Evan, they're gonna kill me, my mother, my sister. Listen, I found a letter addressed to a man named Luke Ravena. It's a name that keeps coming up in Evan's files. He might be the man Evan was dealing with. I have an address for him in Detroit. - Oh no, Nicole! - Look, it's all I've got. I have to find this man, whoever he is-- - And what? Ask for his help? How do you know he's not the one that had Evan killed? - I don't, but I can't hide out in my house and wait for these men to come kill me. I have to get to Detroit without anyone knowing. - How're you gonna do that? - With your help. - Sure, just tell me what to do. - Take off your clothes. - What? - The FBI is following me. So I need you to be me, and take a drive to Washington D.C. in my car. - I get it. I lead them the wrong way. - And I'm going to drive to Detroit to look for Luke Ravena. And if I actually find him, then I'll have something to take to the authorities. Here. These are my credit cards. Use them once you're there. I'm sure the FBI will be tracing them. I'm gonna use cash. - Smart. - Look. Look, I know this is a lot to ask. - No. Hey, we're friends. You'd do it for me, right? Besides, I've always wanted to spend the night in D.C., hunting senators. - You're the best. Thank you. - [Both]: I love you. [ Starting engine ] - I'll miss you. - What're you talking about? It's 3 days. - Yeah, I know, but I'm still gonna miss you. - I love you. [ Breathing deeply ] [ Buzzer ringing ] - Yes? - Hi. I'm Nicole Lauker. This is going to sound strange, but I just drove here from Long Island. I'm looking for Luke Ravena. - Luke Ravena was my husband. He was killed last week in a fire. I'm sorry you wasted your time coming here. - I just lost my husband too. He was killed a few days ago when his boat exploded. I found this in a book my husband was reading. I think our husbands may have been doing business together. - What kind of business was he in? - Commercial real estate. But I don't think their business together was real estate. - Come in. Would you like something to drink? - No, thanks. - I'll be honest with you. I don't know much about Luke's work, except that he travelled a lot. - Evan travelled all the time too. Did your husband ever mention platinum to you? - Not that I remember. Why? - A man came to me and said that Evan was part of a group of men stealing and selling platinum. They would meet at the local strip club. I didn't believe him. And the next day, he was found tortured and murdered. - I met Luke at the strip club where I work. - This letter implies they knew each other. He never mentioned Evan Lauker to you? - No, but I never met many of his friends. He only lived in this area a little over a year. I met him just after he moved here. We got married a month later. He was gone so much of the time, it felt like we were newlyweds. That's me and Luke on our honeymoon in Quebec. We went fishing up North. - Oh my God! - Do you recognize him? - That's Evan. - What? - Oh my God. I had no idea. - There was never a sign he was involved with someone else? - No. - This doesn't seem possible. - The idea of him living a double life. Fidelity was never an issue in our relationship. I loved him. That was enough for me. What I can't understand is why he would fake his own death when he was free to walk away. - Are you certain he faked his death? - You saw him Sunday, didn't you? - Oh my God! If this is true, Evan is responsible for killing 2 people. - We should go to the police. - No! The people Evan sold platinum to will kill me if I go home without the money he stole. - Go to the police here. I'm sure they can coordinate-- - You don't get it! Police can't stop them. They'll kill me, my family. - Well then, we have to find him. Look, whoever threatened you is gonna come looking for me. I'm in the same danger you are. Luke, Evan, whatever his name is, he's alive somewhere. We're just gonna have to find him, before they find us. - This friend of yours actually lives here? - Some of the time. Mac's a bit eccentric. - Yeah, I can see that. - He used to be an undercover cop. He was part of a sting operation that busted a dealer out of the club where I dance. That's how I met him. - Is he retired? - No. Don't let looks deceive you. [ Knocking ] Mac, you in there? Mac's what you'd call a bounty hunter. - A bounty hunter? - Yeah, you know, he finds people for money. Mostly bail jumpers, but he'll track anybody if the price is right. - Will he take a cheque? - He will from me. [ Whistling ] - Well, I'll be damned! - You're not actually eating anything that lives in that water, are you? - I may be old but I ain't crazy. - Well, aren't you gonna offer us something to drink? - I might be a little light on singles, but make yourself at home. - Light on singles? - Yeah, it's a running gag between us. He was always a cheapskate. - So, you're a stripper too, are ya? - Oh, no! She's... She's a friend. - It's good to have friends. So... - Luke was married to Nicole before he married me. - I knew him as Evan Lauker. - You know how he died in the warehouse fire? He went and did the same thing to Nicole a couple of days later in a boating accident. He was stealing and selling platinum. Apparently, he double-crossed his partner and they're after Nicole to make good on the deal. - I have less than a week to find him. - They threatened to kill her, Mac. - I'm surprised you're not dead already. Anybody threaten you, Zoe? - No. Why? - If they didn't know about you before, they might know about you now. - I wasn't followed. - Oh yeah? How do you know that? - I switched cars with my friend. The FBI followed her to Washington thinking it was me. - The FBI? - They're investigating the explosion that killed my husband. They think he's still alive. - If he's gonna be found, I think the FBI is a safe place to lay a bet. Why come to me? - We need to find him first. And you're better than the Feds. - Well, that's true. But even the FBI can track a housewife. Did you buy gas on the way up? - Yes, I did. - How did you pay for it? - Cash. I gave my credit cards to my friend to use in Washington. There is no way they know I'm here. - Let's hope you're right. - Inspector Clouseau! Good to have you back so soon. - Go ahead, laugh. Get it out your system. - Oh relax, Bolton. You're not the first agent to be duped at night by a desperate housewife. Give Lauker some credit. It was well thought out. - Mmm. So? Your gut still tell you she's innocent? - My gut tells me she's in way over her head. And if we don't find her soon, she's gonna turn up in the trunk of her friend's car. - So how did you and Evan eventually get together? Sorry. I keep forgetting you know him as Luke. - No need to apologize for where we're at. Luke, Evan... It doesn't matter. He lied to us both. So to answer your question, in my line of work there are two types of men who wanna date you. Men that wanna nail a stripper, and married men. I could tell right away that Luke wasn't the first kind. He was charming and respectful. I assumed he was married, but he told me he was a widower and I believed him. Married men lie about availability and time, and he seemed to have plenty of both. I was sceptical at first but he was so convincing. Plus he wasn't threatened by me being a dancer, so we started dating. He was fun, romantic and normal. It wasn't hard to fall for him. - They're anagrams. - What? - The names Evan Lauker and Luke Ravena. They're spelled with the same letters. I can't believe I didn't see it before. - That's amazing. What a jerk! - So do you think your friend Mac can really find him? - If anyone can find him, Mac can. - I guess the question is, what do we do if we find him? - Maybe we should toss a coin. See who gets the first shot. [ Water bubbling over ] - Where did you get this? - Luke gave it to me on our first anniversary. - He gave me one on our last. - Hmm... So you're sure it's the same artist, huh? - Absolutely. The sculptures are almost identical and I recognize the signature. - Where is that? - Here. - Oh yeah... "Rémi Benoit," huh? Sounds French. No, thanks. Did your husband ever travel to Europe? No? - We honeymooned in Quebec. - I know an art thief who lives on the west side. Why don't I ask him, huh? Thanks for dinner. So have you heard from the Feds? - No. - If you see them, or if you think you see them, you let me know, you understand? - Yeah, I understand. - Things aren't always what they seem with the FBI. People have a way of turning up dead around 'em. [ Door opening and closing ] - Here's some clean sheets. The spare bedroom is upstairs, end of the hall. - Thanks. - Bathroom's first door on the right. There's a new toothbrush in the cabinet. - Thanks for everything, Zoe. - Sisters of the pole. - Excuse me? - It's just something the dancers say at the club. You know, we're in it together. [ Water running ] [ Muffled scream ] Nicole! [ Distant screaming ] Ah! - Zoe! Zoe, wake up! Zoe, come on! We got to go! Zoe, come on, please! We have to go! Ah! - You OK? - I'm OK. - Any idea who the guy was? - I don't know. One of my adoring fans? - Here. Hold that against it. Well, did either of you get a look at him? - He was like 6-foot, muscular... - What about his face? - He was wearing a mask. But he had a tattoo on his arm. - So, what kind of tattoo? - It was a symbol. Like this. - You two are staying here tonight. You'll be safe here. Me, I got some business in town. Be back late. - Did you find out anything about this? - Yeah. That I should've been an artist. I showed it to my guy. He said it was an original and that there are idiots out there willing to pay $10,000 for the privilege of owning it. - $10,000? - Well, that was my reaction. The good news is when you're that rich, there's usually a paper trail. OK, here's a list of 5 galleries that actually handle these sculptures. The bad news is they're all in Montreal. So guess where I'm headed tomorrow? - You mean guess where we're headed? [ Sighing ] [ Vehicle speeds past ] What's going on? - We're moving. - Oh, good morning, sleeping beauties. We've a long ride ahead of us. - You got to be kidding me. We're not actually going to Montreal in this old tin can? - What did you expect? A private jet? - Well, with gas prices the way they are it might have been cheaper to fly. - Seriously, what kind of mileage do you get with this tub? Five gallons to the mile? - Yeah, yeah. Very funny. - I really don't think this thing is gonna make to Canada. - She's got a point, Mac. When's the last time you actually took it for a spin? - You know, this is a classic recreation vehicle. They don't even make them like this anymore. Besides, I don't like to fly. - Really? Why Earl McDuff, I didn't think you could be afraid of anything. - Well, not everybody is as tough as you two, huh? - What do you mean? - I'm talking about last night. It was a professional hit man you were tousling with. - What? - Well, I told you I recognized the tattoo. I did a little digging around town and apparently the loser who married you, also set somebody up in Detroit and disappeared with the money. Which is why that punk came after you, Zoe. - That's exactly what happened to me in Long Island. - Your lover boy is a real class act, isn't he? Ah, you two sure know how to pick 'em. Oh, your clothes are in the back. - So, thought of what you'll say when we find him? - I think part of me just doesn't want to believe he's still alive. I was kind of taken in so completely. It's... hard not to feel humiliated. - No, it takes courage to lay your heart out there and trust someone. He's the one who should feel humiliated. How many guys do you know that have to fake their own death twice? - Have you thought about what you'd say? - Yeah. I can see it clear as day. I'll say, "Good." - You'd say, "Good"? - Yeah, right after I kick him where it hurts, and watch him fall to the ground and gasp with his last breath, "I can't breathe." - Oh! [ All chuckling ] Why don't you get some sleep? It's gonna be a long trip. - What about you? You hardly slept at all last night. I don't know how you keep going. - Oh, I don't sleep much. - Why not? Why do you do this, Mac? - The money. - Zoe said you used to be a cop. What made you quit? - Just got tired of watching dirtbags buying their way out of doin' time. If it wasn't the lawyers or the judges getting paid off, it was some dirty cop taking a skim to look the other way. - I have a feeling it's a little more personal than that. - It's just easier to help people if you don't play by the rules. - Are you really that noble, Mac? - There's nothing noble about wanting justice. And you may just find that out before this is all over. Why don't you go and get some sleep? [ Sighing ] - So this is Montreal. It's beautiful. - Oh yeah, it's a very beautiful city. I wish I spoke French. - It looks like our luck is turning. We just got a hit on the Canadian border. Nicole Lauker crossed a few hours ago with two other people, Earl McDuff and Zoe Ravena, driving an RV. - An RV? - That's what it says. - Do we know where they're headed? - Not at this point. The best guess is Toronto, but they can be going anywhere at this point. Canada's a big place. - Well, wherever they're headed, leaving the country is not the act of an innocent woman. Let's get more info on the travelling companions and get our Canadian friends looking for American tags. - OK, here it is. 3700 block, rue St. Denis. - All right. That's all of them, but the gallery on St. Laurent. - Where's Mac? He said he'd be here by now. I hope nothing happened. - Mac's sense of time is a little different. He'll be here. [ Sighing ] Found it. - OK. [ Horn honking ] - Hey, ladies! What do you think of the new wheels? Ah... Sorry I'm late. All the damn streets are named after saints! - Where did you get the car? - Oh, I rented it. - You rented it? Did you use a credit card? - Relax. I got my own alias. We can't be driving around Canada with Detroit tags, now can we? Besides, the FBI probably got a hit by now from the border where we crossed. - Where's the RV? - I hid it. So how did you make out with the list? - Well, we found all of them. - Yeah? - And the closest one is the Laurier Gallery. - All right, girls. Let's go bird huntin'! - I was looking for a similar sculpture by Rémi Benoit. Would you happen to have anything like it? - Birds? Oui. I have a beautiful piece right over here. - That isn't by Benoit, is it? - No, but it is exquisite. - Yes, it is. Look, my husband bought me this sculpture last year and I was hoping to get him a matching piece. Is there anyway you could check to see if he bought it here? - Oh, I'm sorry. No. We have a very strict policy regarding the privacy of our clientele. But I can tell you I didn't sell this piece you have. - Thanks. I guess I'll just keep looking. - Oh, any luck? - No. Afraid not. We got one left. - Earl McDuff. He goes by Mac. Ex-cop. He quit the force two years before retirement. Now works as a bounty hunter. As a cop though, he was loyal to a fault. First man in under any circumstances. He was shot in action 4 times. Brought up on excessive force charges twice that. - My kind of cop. - They loved him on the Detroit police force. He got tired of playing by the rules, started head hunting. - What about the woman? - Zoe Ravena. Local stripper. Widowed last week when her husband was killed in a warehouse fire. - That sounds familiar. Do we know where they are yet? - Nuh-uh. - OK. What's the name of the street? - St. Maurice. - See? What did I tell ya? What's up with all these saints? - It's there. Take a left. - Right. [ Horn honking ] - Ah! - There you go, ladies. Door to door service. [ Siren ] Oh, no... [ Speaking French ] - Excuse me? What? - License and registrations, please. - All right. - I don't how people drive where you're from but here we try to do it on the roads, not the sidewalks. - Uh-huh. Yeah well, let me tell you something. Where-- Here you go, officer. - Thank you. - Uh, you go do whatever you have to do and I'll take care of this. - Bonjour, Mesdames... - Hi there. - May I be of assistance? - I hope so. - We're looking for a specific sculpture by a Montreal artist named Benoit. - Rémi Benoit, of course. Very beautiful work. And very expensive. - Do you have some of his work? - Yes. Let me show you. Here we are. There's a few pieces. - That's it! That's exactly what I'm looking for. - You have excellent taste, Madame. - I'll buy it! - You'll buy it? - You're buying it? Fantastic! Um... if you'll follow me. We accept of course, all major credit cards, but first I would need to ask you a few questions for the registry. You are Madame... - Nicole Lauker. - Nicole, it's not fair that you found what you're looking for so quickly and I go away empty-handed. You must let Mr... - Gillette. Adrien Gillette. - You must let Monsieur Gillette show me around before you do your business. - Of course. Please, go right ahead. - It will be my pleasure. - So I've actually started a small sculpture collection... [ Zoe talking ] - I think the artist is trying to convey-- - I am so sorry, Monsieur Gillette, but we'll have to come back later. I forgot my wallet back at the hotel. - Oh no! Uh... But perhaps I could just put it aside and-- - See you, Adrien. - We close at 9:00. - We got him. - Nicely done. - You were so good! He used another anagram. - Yeah? What's he called this time? - Ken Varleau. - How'd you girls make out? - Name, address, and he lives right here in Montreal. - OK... So, how do we play this? - I say we bust down the door and kick his ass. - I'd like the chance to confront him first. Alone. - Forget it. We go in together. - No, let her go, Mac. - What? All right. [ Sighing ] But she takes this with her. See, it's a taser. You hold it like this. You press it here... [ Zapping ] You touch anybody with that, they'll regret coming near you. All right? Be careful. [ Exhaling ] - OK. [ Exhaling ] - Oui? - Hi. I'm looking for Ken Varleau. Are you Mrs. Varleau? - You think that's wife number 3? - If it is, I've some intense therapy ahead of me. - It's his place but he's not here. - Who's the chick? - The maid. - OK. So what do we do now? - She said I can stay and wait for him. - Fine. Then we wait. - I'm OK by myself. - No, forget it. We're in this together. - Zoe, I need to see him alone. - This guy isn't who you think he is. He killed to get away before. There's no reason to think he's not gonna do it again. All right, look. You do what you have to do and we'll park down the street and keep an eye on you. [ Engine starting ] And if you want him to show his true colours, don't tell him we're here. - OK. - Yeah. Where? Are you sure? They found McDuff's camper in Montreal. - Abandoned? - It looks like it. Let's get their pictures out there and get the locals to check for stolen vehicles, car rentals, hotels... all in the last 48 hours. If I were you I'd pack your bags. - Merci. - Bienvenue. - So you're all right with all this? - Well, she married him first. She deserves the first shot. - You know, I mean a guy like this... Zoe, he's no reflection on who you are. - Yeah, but I married him too. I mean, I have to live with that. - Well you know, once this guy shows up, my job here is done. - I understand, Mac. - But you know, I have no problem taking you back with me. I mean, once you're done doing whatever it is that you're gonna do. I mean, I'm not gonna bail on you. - It's OK, Mac. Look, I got my head around what he did to me. Nicole has her own issues, but me, I just need one good shot at his family jewels. [ Dishes being washed ] [ Door closing ] [ Footsteps ] - Oh, we should go in. - No. She knows we're here. Give her a few minutes. - Nicole! How did you find me? [ Breathing heavily ] You have to believe me. It's not what it looks like. - You lied to me! - I did. I'm sorry. But I never meant to hurt you in any way. - You made me think you were dead! - I know, but I didn't have any choice in the matter. - You had no choice? - There are things about me that you don't know. - That's an understatement. - I couldn't tell you before. Since you're standing here, I assume that you have put together that I don't sell real estate for a living. I work for the State Department. Right now, I'm so deep undercover, that you being here can endanger both of our lives. - The State Department? - Look. We've been putting this together for over a year. We're about to close on the biggest black market deal in history. - You expect me to believe that all this is part of some government operation? Evan, you killed two people to pretend you were dead. - No, no! I just stepped off a boat! I had no idea! I had nothing to do with the explosion! I just followed directions. I had no control over the outcome. - I know about Zoe. - Zoe was necessary. She became part of the plan. - You married her, Evan! - Look, I didn't have any other options! I had to convince my contact in Detroit that I was stable, that I was legitimate. We met in a night club where she worked. He got used to seeing her around. It just made sense. She didn't have the same expectations of a relationship that you did. That we did. Nicole... I make the final exchange today, and then it is over. I am out. You and I, we can do all the things that we talked about. We can sail to the Caribbean. - I don't trust you anymore. - I understand why you wouldn't. What can I do, though? I love you. What do you want me to do? - I want to be there. I want to be there when you do whatever it is you do. - No. You shouldn't even be here. - Evan, it's up to you! Either I go with you or I go to the authorities. - I don't think you understand how delicate a situation this is. I'm about to sell $5 million in platinum and expose some very dangerous people. - I know how dangerous they are. - Where'd you park? - I took a cab. [ Engine starting ] - [Mac]: Oh boy... - What's she doing, Mac? - She's making me earn my money. - So where's this exchange supposed to take place? - In a restaurant downtown. You sure about this? - Yeah. - Do you think she told him about us? - No, no, no. She's smart. She's just letting him play his hand. - What are you doing? - Just being careful. - Godammit! - Now what? - Now, we wait for her call. [ Chatter ] - Nobody knows who you are. They'll just think you're my arm piece. So we'll make the exchange and then we'll leave. Don't talk to anybody. Stay with me. - May I help you? - A table for Mr. Varleau. - Right this way. - Don't worry. Just stay with me. Monsieur Chartrand... - Mr. Varleau... You were meant to come here alone. - This is my uh... associate. - They say it's not good for business to mix business with pleasure, you know? Why don't you tell me who you really are? - Only if you promise not to tell his wife. [ All laughing ] - You pick your associates very well, my friend. I should be so lucky. - You'll find the merchandise in the trunk of my car out back. Ha! You're amazing! I can't believe you handled him like that! - I was scared to death! - You were a rock. It didn't show at all. It did not show at all. I just have to go back to the marina and meet my handler. The agency's got a boat there. I get debriefed, and then that's it. What is it? - This. It's all real, isn't it? - Yes, it is. - Evan, I have something to tell you. - What's that? - Zoe's here too. We hired a private detective to find you and... They were following us until you gave them the slip, but I got to call her. - OK. Why don't you tell them to meet us at the marina? I guess I have a little bit more explaining to do. [ Phone ringing ] - Nicole? My God! Are you all right? Where are you? When? OK, yeah. We'll leave right now. Are you sure everything's all right? All right. She wants us to meet them at the marina, so he can explain everything. She says everything is fine. - Tell that to the coroner in Long Island. - Yeah, and Detroit. - Nice bunch of guys. - Well, that's what happens when a country has real gun control. - So, what do you make of our subject stopping at an art gallery? - My guess is as good as yours. Let's find out. - So when this is done, what do you say we highjack this boat, sail through the St. Lawrence, hang a right at the Atlantic and follow the sun down to St. Thomas, hmm? - There they are. - So are you OK with how I'm thinking about doing this? - Yeah. - All right. - He wants to talk to you alone. - Is he going to hypnotize me too? - It's his place to explain to you, Zoe. Not mine. - You're right. It is. - It's a long story, and I promise to fill you in, but I've decided to stay with him. I know it sounds crazy but I saw first hand what he was up against. This should cover your time and expenses. - Thank you. Very generous. Oh, Nicole... Is this really how you want to play it? Don't you maybe want to take some-- just take some time. Think about it. Think about your future. - He was my future. I just don't want to walk away from it. I can't. - Well, he's one hell of a talker. I'll give him that. All right... So uh... look, can you tell Zoe that I'm gonna be up there catching a beer in the pub up there. Thanks. - Hey, Mac? You're cheap at twice the price. Zoe? Evan? Hey, guys? - You always were an easy sell. [ Grunting ] Well, ladies... I thought a little toast was in order to celebrate our unexpected reunion. I guess we're far enough out that you can join in the party. Care for a taste? Oh, that's right. You don't like champagne, now do you? - Why are you doing this? I trusted you! - Oh, and I want to thank you for that. Both of you. Loyalty is a very admirable quality. How about you, Zoe? Huh? You were never one to turn down a drink from an admirer. - Yeah? Well, I never took one from a pig. - Same old Zoe. Yeah, heart of gold, mouth like a garbage can. Well, I guess it's just me then. OK. To the two ladies who have made me a very rich man. - Why this charade? Why didn't you just leave? - Well, I tried to, now didn't I? Hmm? But you followed me all the way up here. That was quite remarkable how you found me. How did you do that? - It wasn't hard. We just put our noses to the wind and followed the stench! Ah! - Leave her alone! - You know... Your sarcasm is wearing just a little thin, Zoe. - I'm the one who found Zoe! I'm the one who figured out your aliases! - My little puzzle genius. - Who are you? - Come on now... You know me, Nicky. I'm the man who's gonna kill you, hmm? Unfortunately, it's not gonna be in such a dramatic way as exploding a boat, but then I don't have anything to hide this time. With the exception of your bodies. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. - Zoe, come here. I've almost gotten through it. Just try, come on. [ Grunting ] - [Evan]: All right. Here we go. - He's almost here. You're insane if you think you can get away with this. - I already have. You know, you're taking this way too personally, Nicky. - It's a little overkill, don't you think? What am I supposed to do? Swim with no arms? - No, you're not. See, this just encourages the fish to chew away your neck, removing your head from your torso. - No! No! Don't do that! Help! Somebody help! Evan, don't do that! Leave her alone! Stop it! Leave her alone! No! Evan, please stop it! [ Gunshot ] Ah! Ah! - Zoe! Nicole! - Mac! - Are you OK? - Yeah, we're OK! - Mac! - Mac! - Mac! - Zoe! OK, I got you. This way. OK. Just stay with me, Zoe. [ Zoe coughing ] You stay here. - Well... It looks like it's back down to you and me, Nicole! What do you say? You think we can put all this behind us? Huh? Start a new life? Learn to trust each other again? No, I guess not, huh? Come on, Nicole. Let's just get this thing done. [ Coughing ] Look who we have here. Well, I guess this is goodbye again, huh Zoe? - I told you to leave her alone. [ Chuckles ] - That's great, Nick. You're a regular action hero. Can you really shoot me with that spear? Can you really do it? Can you kill me? I didn't think so. [ Knocking ] - Good morning. - Oh, thank you. - How are you two feeling? - Like a Shakespeare tragedy. Stabbed in the back, then shot in the back. - The bullet caught her rib before it could do any real damage. Doctor said she was lucky she had so much muscle mass on her back. [ Chuckles ] - I guess I can thank my time on the pole. - How about you? - The fleshy part of my thigh. I guess I can thank my time on the couch. The thing I don't understand is how you found us so quickly? - About half an hour before the Coast Guard got your mayday, we received an anonymous phone call about an abandoned SUV on the marina. We found this on the seat. You guys take care. - Thank you. "If I'm dead, this belongs to the other two stooges." At least, the cheap rascal learned how to tip. - No screaming. Shh, shh... No screaming. I'm here to close our deal. I know you found your husband. Unfortunately, the FBI beat me to the money. It's OK. Shh, shh... It's OK. My employer was impressed with the way you took care of the problem. You're tougher than you look. By the way... if you're ever looking for work, I could use a woman with your talents.
