As I pondered in silence, returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long, a phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect, in beauty, age-- --and power. Looks like the guy is a squatter. Bathroom is locked. No key. Unarmed? Seems likely. Clear. Police. Open the door. Come out slowly, with your hands up. Open the door. Buddy, you can't stay in there. - I - should be telling this with a sigh, somewhere ages and ages hence. If you don't open the door, sir, I'm going to have to break it down. Two roads diverged in a wood. Let me find me something to knock this door down. And I, I took the one less traveled by. And that has made all the difference. You're going to have to open the door. Go. Go, go, go. Contact right! Disturb us, Lord, when we are too well pleased with ourselves, when our dreams have come true, because we have dreamed too little, when we arrive safely because we sailed too close to the shore. Do you see that guy loading his RPG? Got him. I'm going in! FRAG out Is he dead? West side target building. Goddamn! Morley's dead! Ghost! Get in the fucking fight. Tally Cover! Shit! God! God, it was too fucking close. You good? I'm good. I'm good. I owe you. You owe me shit. Hey, Sammy. Listen. Listen, listen. Are we clear? Clear. Let's move. Hey! Hey! You fucking crazy? What? They got him turned around, man. No, Ghost. We wait here, man. They baitin' us. What are you doing? I'm going to loan you a pair of men's underwear. You stain them, you own them. You keep them. Yeah. Let me know. Braden I got it. I've got it, Ghost. I've got it. There you go. Bring it. There you go. This is the the last motherfucker I'd thought I'd be slung over my shoulder. I said I'm not feeling it, Ghost. Well, you can tell everybody you led the way. I'm the First Sergeant. I say we stay the fuck here. Atta boy. Stack up! Why? You're an ass. On three! Three! God! Fuck! Motherfuckers! Hey! Let me go! Put the cuffs. Get him up. Walk! No! No! Don't do this! Don't do this! I need a medic! I need a medic! Believe this guy? Something else. All right, buddy. Let's see. You've got anything shoved in your pockets? Anything going to prick me? As to me, directing like flame, its eyes with finger pointing to many immortal songs. Take a break. A menacing voice, what singest thou, it said. Knowest thou not there is but one theme forever enduring bards. And that is the theme of war. The fortune of battles. The making of perfect soldiers. Hey, Tony! What you doing? Let me get that for you. He's got it. Looks like they knew you That's funny. Who tagged it? I don't know. Locals, gang bangers, who knows? Who's the kid? He's Pete. You got any paying work? No. And none coming down the line either. Sorry about that, bud. You said Venice Boulevard moved out. Extended their lease. How about that building you just bought? It's in escrow. All right. Did you get a new bike? Yeah. You mind if we settle up on the last little bit of work? Pete, take five. You want to settle up? Of course. Come here. There you go. Actually it comes to a whole lot more. That's it. We're settled. I'm not clear. You're not clear. OK. Well, you want me to explain it to you? You spent the two weeks that you were meant to be working doing pull ups off the side of that building in the alley. And I caught you reading more than once. During my breaks. What breaks? What are you, union? There's no breaks. You're working four to five hours a day. If it falls on your lunch, that's fine. But there's no breaks. The VA docs says to exercise to keep my heart rate up so I get oxygen to my brain. Yeah. I don't want to get into it. And they told me to read to take my mind off other things. So can-- can you just pay me the rest of what you owe me? Look, I'm going to make this plain and simple for you. I am not paying you to get fit. OK? You want to fuck around, there's plenty other assholes you can work for. Not like you. You're just like all of them, looking for a handout. My injury's real, bro. Your injury's real? Then you should do what your doctor said. He told you to read, bro? Then get a job as a librarian. You know what? You built the house. Own it. Pay me what you owe me. Now. Now? You enjoy living in a country where you can mouth off to whoever, whenever? You're welcome. Thank you for that. Thank you for your service. Now get off my fucking premises. Walk away, Will. Pete, get back to it. You were the bigger man. Yeah, I mean it. You did the right thing. You walked away. I wanted to beat his ass. Understandable. Well, it's good to know I still got a little fight left in me. I was ready to go, man. I bet. And he was a big son-of-a-bitch. How big? 6'4 or 6'5. 6'5? Yeah? Ish. You know I ain't a lover. Yeah, I know. Hell no. Hell no. He was a bad ass. You know, Ghost, you could cage fight. Well, you know I'm younger than I look. Hey, come on, man. You look great. You mean that? I mean that. Fuck, yeah, I mean it. You could model, probably. Look at this face. You could model. Great way to meet girls. I bet this guy meets a lot of girls. Hell, yeah, he does. All right. Now they say that you ain't drunk if you can lay on the ground without holding on. And who's "they"? The experts. OK. Let's see. Shit. I'm sober. All right. Hands down on the board beside your shoulders. OK. Palms down, like you're going to do a push-up. All right. And you thrust your upper body up in the sky-- You look like you're fucking a crab hole. --and you sweep your legs underneath you, and-- I hope you can swim. Why? Because you ain't even on the board, Ghost. Shit. Yeah. Hey. Give me a second. Hey. Hey, hey. Ghost, don't go over here. Now those are friends of mine. I see them down here all the time. Ghost. What are you talking about? Why would you say that? Listen to me. You're not looking for him. So you leave him alone. I mean it. Ghost? You'll be all right. Wait! You-- you forgot-- you forgot your kiss! His lips must be getting tired. I ain't going to watch a soldier beg. Pisses me off. Let's pass him. Moving, on the right. Spare some change. A comedian. Aw, man! I'm just screwing with you. Yo, smile! It's a celebration. What we celebrating? That we're rich. Did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith, and heirs to the kingdom which he promised to those who love him? The who and the what? The what? Are you military? 'Nam. '71. Is that boonie part of your uniform? Was. So what's all that crap on it? Shit I've collected. Well, can you clean it up and show a little respect? You do that? What, you don't agree? This going to take long? I got a 2 o'clock tee-time and 18 hole-- Go ahead. Hey, is this thing in park, Ghost? Bless you, brother. It enrages me and it breaks my heart to see people that serve this country standing on the streets begging for scraps. You with me? I know that you know how to wear this. But just in case you forgot. You wear any piece of this uniform, you stand tall proud, hooah? Hooah. You fought for this country. I did indeed. Remember that. You take care of yourself. Moving. Moving. Thanks, babe. How is it? Rocky fucking road. It's like Run DMC, shit never gets old, man. Peter Piper picked peppers, but Run rapped rhymes. Hey, read me this. No. For me. Come on, Ghost, can I just sit and eat my ice cream? Come on. It'll take my mind off the calories. I ain't your book bitch, man. No, but you could be. Why don't you just get a book on tape or some shit? Dude. Today, across our fathers graves, the astonished years reveal the remnant of that desperate host which cleansed our East with steel. Troop's had contact. Reinforce to Bravo checkpoint. I'm gonna pull off. God damn! Wait! Clarence Miller's been shot! Cover! They're moving left. Get him up against the tire. He's shot in the neck. My neck! Put pressure on that wound. Hail and farewell! We greet you here, with tears that none will scorn-- O keepers of the House of old, or ever we were born! I want my money. What do you mean you want your money? I told you to get off my property! You owe me $145! Get off my property! I worked for you! You owe me money. I told you to get off my premises. Now get out of here. That's assault! If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they are gone, and so hold on when there is nothing in you except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!" I am going to call the police. You rip me off all the time. That is assault, Buddy. You're going to jail. I'm calling the police. That's assault. Police! You're going to jail! All right, move your hand, brother. Let's go. Move, move. One service more we dare to ask, pray for us heroes. Pray that when fate lays on us our task, we do not shame the day. We got a vehicle inbound. It's not slowing. VBED! Light them up. Stay on them. Go, go, go, go, go, go Hey, asshole. We're even. Son of a bitch! Hey! Sorry. What? What? That is not the way you answer the phone in this office. Really? Well, then get it yourself nimrod. Nimrod? I don't know what's happening to you lately, but you're becoming completely unreliable. You know what? I quit. You quit. Um, yeah. I do. I quit. I quit. I'll be so sorry to see you go. Sorry to see me go? No, no. You are not sorry to see me go. I work harder than a hound dog at a flea convention, and you make me feel more useless than a kickstarter on a commode. I ain't an asskisser, Mr. Boss Man, and I sure as hell ain't about to take any more this-- this horse shit. Ladies. Gents. It's been real. Mary-Anne, wait. Emmers, you text me. Late! OK. Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah. My highway, the yellow lines that disappeared from time to time, and half wound up on the wrong side of the road. My highway, I've gone too fast, afraid that I might finish last, I hugged a curve too hard, and lost control. I never know which way it's going to go. But what a feeling, chasing a sun and living my life like a shot from a gun, laughing a little bit more with every mouth. O what a freedom, racing the wind, dying to know what's around the next bend, smiling as I watch the years roll by. I'm learning how to take it day by day, on my highway. Yeah, yeah, what a freedom, like sailing the wind, not looking back, not forgetting where I been, smiling as I watch the years roll back. And I'm moving on from my mistakes. And I'm learning how to take it day by day on my highway. Yeah. That's disgusting. Disgusting. What? Freak. Wait, how do I know that guy? İt's that actor. That it for you? This and a bottle of Silver Coyote. You having a party? No. I sure hope you're not drinking that and getting on that bike. Don't drink and ride. Cash? Charge. Reginald Anthony Millhouse. It's a family name. Robert, that's a good one. Don't hate me cause you ain't me. Paper bag? Save a tree. Thank you. I wrote this sitting on a tarmac in Iraq, for Private Woody Farnsworth, waiting on a bird. I mean that ain't the name of the song, that's just what I was doing. Anyway, remember Woody? Helmet for a pillow. Ground is our bed. I watch your six, and you'll watch mine, so we don't wake up dead. We're miles away from all we love, brothers side by side. We all know why we're here, why we bleed and died. We fight for freedom, for the mini and youth, lay down our lives, feel the rain, standing for the truth. So don't you ever worry, sleep easy and sleep tight, 'cause we are here, protecting you, keeping watch till night. We're simple soldiers, doing what we do. Just simple soldiers, yeah, yeah. We would did for you. We would die for you. That was him. Crazy. roll my windows down, and cruise down a back road-- Bryan Cranston, that actor. You lie. And he rode right by me, I swear it was him. Bryan Cranston, the "Breaking Bad" guy. Shuts up. My god, he's one hunk of a redheaded man. Why didn't you pull him over? Yeah, that's a great idea. Like I'm going to pull over Bryan Cranston. Why not? Please. I would have. I love me some ginger. OK. You still there? Yeah. Sweetheart, are you OK? Yes. I am, I really-- I needed this, Emmers. I did. I hated that frickin' job. And that dingleberry I had to answer to. My life for so long it's just been so dang boring. You just need a man. Well, men don't like me. Men like you. Men like strippers, they like pole grinders, girls who twerk for a living. It's brutal. Look, Emmers, I know, I know, it was impulsive of me. To just storm out like that, but I -- I just had to, I had to had a break away, free myself from all the shit. You know? And it feels good. 'Cause it's dangerous, I like it. I like it. Feels like I'm just living on the edge. I just hope that running away was the right thing, you know? Yeah, well, it is, I know it is. You know what you should do? Something you never do. You should just-- What? You ready? Yeah, I'm ready. Let your hair down. Yeah, no, I should. Can you imagine? I'll just let it down. Now. I don't wear it down, I wear it up, and I-- and I like it up, so--. This is the new you, Mary-Anne. You want to live dangerously? Do you? Then grab danger by the balls, and do it. Do it. Jeez Louise. Fine. Fine. Good Lord, I don't know about that. No, I don't think so. So where are you at now? Fixing to pass Las Cruces. Florida, here I come. It's going to be fun. What on earth was that? That's him, that's him! That's him! That's Bryan Cranston! He must be going 100 miles an hour. So hot. Try and stay with him. I'm trying. I'm trying, he's too fast. My god, Mary-Anne, don't let him get away. Bryan! Bryan, wait! Wait! Are you kidding me right now? Come on. Jesus. Hi, um, just $12, please. You sure are pretty. What's that? Thank you, that's, um-- thank you. You're-- you're so creative. What is that you're whittling? A spearhead. Coming along very nicely. Miss? Yeah, I'm sorry, I don't have time to chat. I'm really-- I'm trying to catch somebody. Would you like some candy? Ew. That's ew. Hey? Excuse me? Yoo-hoo? Excuse me, Mr. Cranston? All right, you OK? You all right there? I was coming in pretty quick. Shit, I might've clipped its hind leg. Your beard is amazing. Yeah? It's kind of like carrying a porcupine on your chin. It must be for a role. You think the dog was hurt, or? Well, it's hard to tell. Took off running so damned fast. At least you kept straight. Better the dog than you. That is the upside. So are you-- you working on anything new, or? What, no, I'm just being fan, a silly fan. That's-- Come here, boy! Come here, boy! That was just me. Come here, boy. Come here, boy. Come on. I sure do you like your scooter. You know bikes? Well, I'm a Texas girl. It's either real horses, or steel horses. No choice. Got to ride one or the other. No shit. It's hot, in the car. Sure you don't want one? Ice cold. I'm all good, thanks. Let's see, where are we? We should be somewhere right around there. It was pretty easy to get turned around on these country roads. Yeah. I'm Mary-Anne Mackey. People call me Ghost. People call you Ghost? Again. That's amazing. Low profile, I like it. Well, I got it because nobody ever sees me coming. They'd sure hear you, though. Because of the scooter. You be careful out there, Mary-Anne Mackey. I should be at work right now. Playing hooky? I up and quit. Tell you something, Mr. Ghost. Five days a week I woke up at 6:00 AM sharp to classic iPhone Marimba ringtone number one. I make it 1,870 hours a year sitting in an 8 by 12 cubicle turning some son of a bitch rich. Only thing I had to look forward to was Monday through Friday, somewhere between 3:25 and 3:30 Cleve the office boy, he'd make a Starbucks run, bring me back a venti, two pump, caramel macchiato, extra hot. I'm a single, hard working, professional woman, who ate a lot of horse shit. And I just-- I woke up a couple mornings ago, and I said to myself, gosh darn it, I need some excitement in my life. Jeez. OK. Sorry. Sorry. Disney World. That's where I'm headed. For excitement. I guess I misunderstood. I've never done anything that before. Have you? When I was 17. Well, I won't leak this, I promise. Probably best you don't. You know what I want? I'd be guessing, but a little cuddle. To be you. Just for a flash. Just to know what it feels like. You ever want what I have? All the time. Albuquerque Crowne Plaza. See you down the road, stud. St. Louis like Louis D, Miles, and Larry Hughes. And the Young Dude done paid young dudes' dues dude. But yo, what da hook gon' be? Yo, see I don't need no fucking hook on this beat. Shit! All I need is the track in the background. My headphones loud, keep the blunt going around. And I'm-a rip. Yo, yo, wat da hook gon' be? See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat. Shit. All I need is the track in the background, my headphones loud. Keep the blunt going round. And the sun will come out tomorrow, and I will never have to borrow. Got my first car when I turned-- No. No. I'm sorry. It's declined. You don't ride, do you? Troopin', troopin', troopin' to the sea. 'Ere September come again, the six year men are free. Leave the dead behind us, for they cannot come away, to where the ship's a-coalin' up that takes us home today. We're going home, we're going home, a ship is at the shore. And you must pack your 'aversack, for we won't come back no more. Don't you grieve for me my lovely Mary-Anne. For I'll marry you yet, on a fourp'ny bed, as a time-expired man. Man, don't fill your head with that shit. I think it's beautiful. It's useless. Doesn't serve you. But it does. Man, I'm telling you it's the energy you need to put into something bigger. Such as? Yourself. Got a lot of work to do. Wasting your time. Only thing real you got is time. Just because you didn't take a bullet over there, doesn't mean the mission's over. The mission? Life, brother. Look here, man. The books, the poems, you're lost in them, come back to us, OK? Those are other people's dreams, they're not yours. You just holding onto them because you've given up on your own. Heal the fucking wounds and move on. I said heal them, Will. Not open them up. Silence is the killer. Silence is the killer. I'm giving you an ear, brother. Use it. It's just you and me here, brother. Now, remember when we were kids, we were in school? We would have share days. Those RPG hits to our convoy. You want to take a stroll down memory lane? We lit those fucking vehicles up. We powed out of the back. I was there, I know what happened. I don't care to be thinking about this shit. And I watched that kid jump out of the forward Humvee, Will. One big flame. He's flailing around, screaming my name. And I looked at him. I did, I looked at him, and I remember thinking, how messed up, how disfigured he'd be if he shipped back home. And I was happy that it wasn't me. I condemn myself for that thought. There ain't no compassion in that. Ghost. It's your turn, brother. You gotta talk. I don't. You sure about this? $200 seems like an awfully good deal for this kind of watch. We're all set. Well, if that's all you'll take for it, I'm going to throw in your drinks, too. If you don't mind. Sure do appreciate it. Refill, please. I'm going to take it to go. You got it. Powdered Creamer? A touch, thanks. Here you go. And another round for my friend, here. Well, I got him covered, but here you are. Compliments of the young service member. Mighty nice of you, thank you. And I'll thank you in return. How's that? I see you there. Army? Saw your memorial bracelet. Yeah, well. It was a body. Sorry to hear. Wearing that, you must miss him. Actually I can't get rid of him. Thanks for serving, my friend. I was 1st battalion, 8th Marines. Got out after the Beirut bombing, 1983. Islamic jihad took 241 Americans, but they didn't take me. Bad day. I was a younger man, I'd still be fighting. To the warriors. Warriors. Sherry. Larry. You ready young lady? Duh. Here you go. Who is she talking to? Your guess is as good as mine. You ready for this? She broke my 16-year-old heart, she did. Can you believe it? I would. Boy boy. I could tell you some stories. She was my first love. I took her to the high school prom. She was a hell of a looker back then. Is that so? Yeah, but then she let the guys get all over her, and that done changed her. She ain't the girl she used to be, that's for sure. You took her to your prom? I did. In a big old shiny limousine. Can she dance? Let me think about that. I believe so. Why don't I turn up the music, and you could get on out there and see what she's got. All right. Friend? She's just an old bird, looking for more. Doesn't know how to go about getting it. You with me? I gotcha. Young lady? Never seen you before. The fuck is that? It's my hand. Well I know it's your hand, dummy. That's-- Well, it's an invitation. Invitation? Where are you going to take me? Well, I was going to take you out to the dance floor. Where I really want to go is France. France? France, Well, that could be tough. You for real want to dance? I'll bet you could teach me a couple of things. I am a little bit older. I shit, I'm not much of a mover anymore. You know back in the day I could have showed you a real mean Cotton Eye Joe. Don't make me beg, now. All right. Let's see if I remember how the fuck to do this. Whoop, got you. All right. You may want to hold onto my shoulders, and just shake your hips and walk around real slow, ain't much to it. That's all got to do? All you got to do. I can do that. Hey, Larry? Don't get jealous, now. I can cut in whenever you're ready, darling. I feel so bad. I got a worried mind. I'm so lonesome all the time. Something like this? Something like that. Leave my baby behind on Blue Bayou. Save a nickle, save a dime, work until the sun don't shine. Looking forward to happy time on Blue Bayou. I'm going back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou. Where the-- Bum, bum, budum bum, bum bum. I wouldn't do that. You're shit faced. You are underestimating me, First Sergeant. I am sober. Get on over here, you old see through son of a bitch. I gotta tell you something. OK, tell me. All right, but you gotta promise you won't take it the wrong way. I promise. Scout's honor. I'm going to tell you. Tell me. You are sexy as shit for a dead guy. Get out of here. That shit ain't worked for me since I crossed over, but I gave you a heads up on it, though. You're so lucky, man. Why am I lucky, Ghost? Because for you, it ain't about fucking anymore, is it? Who told you that? It's obvious, dead dudes don't fuck. Where'd you hear that from? I researched it. But it ain't about fucking at all, is it really? Here, there? I mean what we need to be doing is teaching people what you know. I wouldn't argue on that. I wouldn't recommend it. Look, people gotta learn how to love, man. Who are you it's? It's what's in here, not here, that's what it's about. And you know what? Where's my friend? Where is Ghost? I want to find Ghost. Look. You probably spend about 20 of your 30 some odd years here on earth and about 90% of those 20 years looking for poontang. Yeah. Why? Exactly. Now, I'm a bit of a philosopher. I think a little outside the box. Just a little bit? It occurred to me, since dead dudes don't fuck, then clearly poontang is not of importance in your dimensions. Why do we think we need it so bad here, man? I mean break it down, its primary function is to provide by a porthole from one side to the. An entryway, if you will. With hair on. Soft type, but you know that's how I like it, Buddy. I like a big old bush. You like it so much it's on your fucking face. I get lost in it. I need to know the point, Ghost. What's the point? Hold up. Am I following you, 'cause I-- I thought it was you. Man, I was following you. Let me see that. Left foot, right foot. All right. Sammy, I made a decision that I'm going to regret the rest of my life. What's that? I put my best friend in the enemy's skull, and I lost him. I made the decision on my own to break cover, Will. I was careless. Look at me. You were brave. You trusted me. I'd take a bullet to bring you back. What do I-- What do I do? Fuck. It's perfect, thank you. Just use the bed right there. Here you go. It's a beautiful day. Will? William? Is that you? Looks like you're a pretty good shot. I think I may know where you get that from. You know who I am? Yes, sir. You sure? Yes, sir. Can I approach you? Yes sir. It's all right, buddy. I brought you this monster truck. I don't know if you're into these things, but it seemed kind of cool. I like it. Boy, it's been so long I hardly recognize you. Yes, sir. You got big. My momma told me that you got sick during the war. She said you had to go away. Your momma said that? Is it true? Yeah, it is. Did you get injured? I did. What happened? I got caught a couple of explosions. They injured my brain. They call it TBI. What's TBI? Traumatic brain injury. And I-- I lost a friend over there, too, and that hurt me pretty bad. I lost a lot, actually. I lost your momma, I lost you. Are you better now? Son, right this second I sure am. William! Get away from my son. Kimmie? What's wrong? Don't be alarmed. What? William's father showed up here today. And? Jesus. I told him that I needed to speak to you first, that it wasn't an appropriate time to visit, but he insisted. I'm sorry, Buddy. I had to put dinner on, he's still here. Where is he? He's here right now? Where? He want to see William. And that's a decision he made when? He's in Will's room. I couldn't refuse him. Well, he just going to have to leave. No. It's that simple. No. Just-- All right, I'll leave. No, stay, God dammit. Please don't do this to me. Shit. This is called a wedge formation. Why do they use it? Well, you got all your firepower here at the front, and see your flanks this whole sector is covered. Are you out of the Army now? Yeah. Do you miss it? Every day. Why don't you go back? Because I got things to do here, now. Were you a ground pounder? You know about ground pounders? My friend's brother is in the Air Force. That's what he calls army guys. I want to be in the military. Little man, I fought so you wouldn't have to. I just don't think I can handle civilian life. What makes you think you can handle military life? What makes you think I can't? You love your country? Yes, sir. Well, that's the only requirement. I think the army would be happy to have you. The Navy. The what? I want to be a Seal. A Seal? What, about like Delta or something? No, a Seal. Let's say we'll talk about that later. Will has his player evaluations coming up for the new season. It's an exciting afternoon. There's barbecuing and games for the kids, music. Be nice if you could come, Will. When is that? Its next week, I have to-- I'd have to look. So what are your plans, Will? I'm not sure. So you're missing work? I don't really have a set schedule. Buddy. Mom, can I have more pasta? Yeah, of course. I'm glad you like it. California, right? You said that's where you live. Correct. So what are you doing in Cali that you can just pick up and go? Bud, you want an extra helping? No, thank you, sweetheart. I'm fine, thanks. Will? No, thank you. I'm a painter. So am I. You paint? I do. Come on. That's awesome. That's wonderful, Will. That's surprising. Really? Does your work sell? It's public. Site specific? Sure would love to see your portfolio sometime, Will. One would think that us country folk out here don't appreciate the fine arts, but I assure you, that is just not the case. What is it, exactly, that you country folk appreciate about it? Mom, may I be excused to go finish setting up my soldiers? That's fine, but you need to ask somebody else, too. Dad? Yeah. Goodbye. Bye. Thank you. I apologize, I know that was uncomfortable. It was all just so sudden, that's all. Hey, I'm happy for you. He's a good man. It's what you always wanted. Nice to finally meet you. Thank you for your hospitality. So you came here for your son, right? Put me at ease, right now. At ease. The angels are stooping above your bed. They are weary of trooping with the whimpering dead. God's laughing in heaven to see you so good, the sailing seven are gay with this mood. I sigh and I kiss you, for I must own that I shall miss you when you have grown. Hello? Mary-Anne Mackey? Hello, invisible man. I knew that was you. Come on up. You need to be alone? No. Tell me. We don't talk about him so much, hon. He's not at all what I expected. Which was? I don't know. Just taking it all in. You still love him. Why would you ask that? It's not a question. I love you. What? You are so beautiful. You are so talented. I don't know what you're saying, but I'm going to take those kind words and run with them. Your work. I love your work. Action! More, please. More. Ghost. Who's Ghost? Hi. Hi, darling. How are you? What happened? What? What happened what? You sound different. No, I can't lie to you. Spill it. I really like her. Is it love? I don't know, I guess it could be. What base you at, you old perv. You know, first, second. I hit a homer first time at bat. My brother, you disappoint me. What happened to it's in here. I know. Not in here. I know. You're working backwards. Apparently. Hold off on introducing yourself to her. You don't want to freak the girl out. Met this guy. No shit. And? And, I-- You what? I want to take him home with me. Yeah! What was that? That's fantastic. So tell me about him. Well. So this is the master plan, but it's all good. You feel it? Feels right. This last phase of your life, where you landed, it was just supposed to be a layover. You just missed your connecting flight, but you know what? Someone up there must like you, because there's another one boarding right now. And if you run, you might just catch it. Will my baggage make it? Let's hope the hell not. You know, man, 11 years ago my wife delivered by c-section. The doctor reached into the hole in her stomach, and with blue rubber gloved hand pulls out my son, and holds him under this white operating light, long waxy umbilical cord dangling below. And I have forgotten everything prior to that moment, 'cause the experience of meeting my son for the first time trumped everything in my life. And then I walked away, put on my gear, went to war. And boy, I thought I was going to come back with stories to tell him about how brave I was, how I put myself in the line of fire. In harm's way for our country, his future. Now the fighting is over, but it's like I never came home, because it's all I think about. I've been this guy trying to survive his own war stories for so long, I can't hardly remember who I'm really supposed to be. It'll come back to you. Just give it time. Hope so. Know so. Different how? Well he's kind of rough around the edges. Well, that can be a good thing, sometimes. Yeah, I just-- I hope he doesn't think I'm one of his groupies. Whoa, stop right there. No, I'm hanging up. I'm hanging up. Hanging up. Hanging up. No, wait. What? Mary-Anne, are you sleeping with Bryan-- It's the adrenaline. Not having it one day you're running, you're gunning, next your standing on a street corner in your hometown, nothing but time. To remember. I had a purpose over there. You got one here, too. You know, once you sort through all this shit and own it, is gold, baby. There's hundreds of thousands of veterans out there, just like you Ghost. You can help them, they need it. That's your purpose, and you mean it. OK? But you have to be a survivor. You've got to have the answers, Ghost, or they won't listen. I understand. Love to help. Well, that's your purpose, here. I mean it. I suppose. You know, I have been thinking about what you were saying about me modeling. So you just want to be rich. Well, wouldn't you? Yo. I wrote a new song. Another thing I want to talk to you about is the lotto. But that's illegal. To get the winning numbers from the other side? I just can't give them to you. Do you know them? Maybe Well who's going to-- You want to hear the new song, or what? OK. I don't have my guitar. I got you. All right. You follow? Clear as a bell. When the night's too dark, and the day's too cold, and you can't find a single thing to rest your weary soul, at the end of every tunnel, there's a light to guide you home, and you don't have to worry, 'cause you'll never be alone. I will always be there for you. Said I will always be there for you. Hey, Dad. No matter what you're going through. Let's see what you got. Let's see what you got. I will always be there for you. Mom, I'm going to go play on Dad's bike. OK, we're coming. Watch me, though. Hard to believe. Yeah. I can't leave here. I know that. But if I could, I would, I would follow you. I've never seen him so happy. I've never seen you this happy. This is who I fell in love with. I watched the fighting on TV from our living room, Will. Babe, you don't have to. And I was scared that you were never going to come home, and that I was going to be a widow, that our son wasn't going to have a father. I panicked. There was this woman who moved down the street when you were gone, her name was Arlene. She was seven months pregnant. I was putting William in the car seat when a gray army van pulled up in front of her house. Those men weren't even out the vehicle before she started screaming. I just ran to her, and I left William in the car, I mean we didn't even know each other, but I held her in my arms while they told her that her husband had been killed in action. I just couldn't bear it. I wasn't that strong. And I was lonely. And I'm still lonely. And I am so damn happy that you're alive. Now, go be with your son. I love you. Hey. God damn, this guy stinks. Jesus Christ. Fuck, man. Jesus. Give me that. Hey! Hey! Come on. Get your bag. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Get it, boy. All right. Just like that, bro. You dance like a fucking Weeble-Wobble. Hey, now, you ain't gotta understand how I do, yeah? You definitely don't understand how I do. Here. Hey! I got the patent on that shit, man. I'm gonna call it the one-legged jam. Hey, shit, what are we drinking to? What are we drinking? Shit. No more, motherfucker. What do you mean, no motherfucker? I mean no more of the fuckin' war, motherfucker. I'm drunk. I forgot. She's a marine. Let me tuck you in. I'm tucked, I'm tucked. You tucked? Yeah, you are tucked the fucking-- and you're drinking. Hold this shit. Did you just pour a fucking beer on my leg? Hey, you got a name? What do you go by? McGill. McGill Charles Burroughs, baby. Lance Corporal Charles Burroughs. Just Charlie, though. Just Charlie. Charlie Burroughs. Fuck. You know why Marines have holes in their forehead, Charlie Burroughs? Shit. Why is that? Because they try teach him how to eat with a fork during basic training. Look, I know that's an old one, but it's a classic. I couldn't fit my head in a jar, so I went Army. My daddy was Army, man. Shit, he told me in the Marines were the first to fight. You know my daddy, man. My daddy died overseas. Operation Iraqi Freedom. IED. Transport his remains all the way up Arlington National, man. See, I ain't never been. You know, I never even had a chance to say goodbye, either. My mama wouldn't take me. She says she wanted me to remember his smiling face, not his burial place. How old was he? 38 years young. Shit. I enlisted right after they put him on the ground. Went to basic, out of basic, straight to combat. Made E3, then lost my fucking leg. Man, I shipped right back home. I was a Marine for about a-- a minute. Hey, you know they could hook you up with a better piece than this old can opener. Shit. You know, it took about a year just to get into the system, brother. And then after like two years, I still hadn't gotten anything, you know what I'm saying? So I quit. That's the temp leg lag they gave me when I first got stateside. Look, man. The military, man, they gave my dad an education, put food on the table. So I ain't going to talk shit about the military. But the VA, the VA's a fucking shit show, man. No lie. Shit. OK. Shit. I'm gonna take a nap, brother. Hey. Here for the party. Come on in. Get you a drink? What's with the leg? It's a bit of a story. Who's that? That's my new friend, Charlie Burroughs. Hi. What's he doing in my bed? He's a little drunk. Correct. Listen, he's a great kid. He's homeless, I offered to let him get cleaned up, but that never happened, because we got into the tequila. And then he taught me a couple dance moves that I'd like to show you later, and the rest is history. I want him out of my bed. Right now. Out, out! Come on. Hey. I'm sorry, man. It's cool, it's cool. I get it. Yes. Hi. Can you send someone up to change the sheets in my room? Thank you. Jesus. You know what? I want you both out. Both. Both of you, out. Let's move, come on. I'm moving. Now you move. Don't talk to me like that. You are in my hotel room, may I remind you. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! I told you to back the fuck up. He's pointing a gun at me. Keep your voice down. Put the took gun down. How do you want this to go? How dare you. Think I'm going to let some bitch talk to me like that? Come on, friend. Come on. Hey. I helped you back there, why are you doing this? Say that to me, man. We're brothers. Hey. Mary-Anne, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Please. Listen to me. Wait, please. We're both drunk. This is going to seem really fucking stupid in the morning. I promise you. Charlie. We're the same, bro. I served, I'm a fucking vet too, I got the scars to prove it. And this ain't how we act. Hey. And I'm homeless. I'm tired, man. I'm tired. Isn't that yours, that bag? He's so drunk, he doesn't even realize it ain't his. Look, this is empty. The barrels plugged, it's for show. I don't know if I heard you right or not. I'm going to ask you this one time, one time only, OK? I want the god damn truth, you hear me? I do. Are you, or are you not? Yeah. Are you? Are you Bryan Cranston? Not that I'm aware of. Get out. Out! Get out! Out! Mom, look. I put the drawing in here with the letter. Your dad's at the same spot. What time is it? 6:15. He's late. 15 minutes. Go wait by the door, and run out and greet him when he gets here. Get off! No. I'm sorry. You did this? Why? I don't know. Here. Give me that. I'm a walking target with this leg, man. That gun, it's just for protection. Here rests in honor, glory an American soldier known but to God. Tomb of the Unknowns. You familiar with it? My daddy's laying close by. Tomb's guarded by soldiers of the Army's 3rd infantry. This badge belonged to a friend of mine. Best friend. It was an honor. After the astronaut badge, this is the second least awarded qualification badge of the United States Army. He'd want you have it. It goes here. Wear it proudly. It's hard-earned. I missed you so much, little man. Don't go. Please, Dad. Hey. I'll be back. You have my word, I promise. I promise. Dad? Yeah? I love you. I love you too, boy. Go, go. Let's go. Where to? It's a surprise. Get on. It's like a storm that cuts a path it breaks your will, it feels like that. You think you're lost, but you're not lost on your own, you're not alone I will stand by you, I will help you through, when you've done all you can do, and you can't cope, I will dry your eyes, I will fight your fight, I will hold you tight, and I won't let you fall. Don't be afraid to fall. I'm right here to catch you, I won't let you down. He won't get you down, you're going to make it, yeah I know you can make it, because I will stand by you, I will help you through, when you've done all you can do, and you can't cope. And I will dry your eyes, I will fight your fights, I will hold you tight, and I won't let go. It's beautiful, man. Ain't it? Yeah. Tell me what's up? I made a promise to a friend. Friend? You know, brother, not all military casualties of war end up in hospitals and national cemeteries. Some make it back, others make it back, never make it home. I want to bring those vets home. Trained to save lives, Charlie. Suppose we need to be doing just that. Man. He's here, man. I can feel it. 522. 525. 426. 450. 380. 390. 390. First Sergeant Samuel Gallegos, the 3rd infantry division's first armored brigade combat team. I great friend, a great soldier. American through and through. And you. Sergeant, First Class Will-- William Gardner. You too are a friend at the highest order. A valiant soldier. Your service, your bravery, your strength of character represents what America stands for. I salute you, and it's a real honor to be able to thank you for protecting our country. The land of the free, the home of the brave. And your service to which I will never forget And I thank you for yours. Much time spent in harm's way. Together, brother. Together, brother. Well, this is it, man. I hate goodbyes. They're the worst. But you're on the road to reclaiming what's yours, Will. And that's a beautiful thing. Don't go soft on me. You helping those returning soldiers. It's good for the heart. You know what else would feed the heart? Tell me. You clocking time with your son. I intend on it. Good, because I demand it. That an order? If it was, would you take it? Well, this one, I might. Be a first. Hey. You need them? Bite me. Atta boy. Take this kiss upon the brow, and in parting from you now, thus much let me avow. That you are not wrong who deign, that my days have been a drain. Yet if hope has flown away, in a night or in a day, in a vision or in none, is it therefore the less gone? All that we see, or seem is but a dream within a dream. Thank you, brother. California license plate, 16, Juliet, 0100. California license plate, 16, Juliet, 0100. I stand amid the roar of a surf tormented shore, and I hold within my hand grains of a golden sand. Ma'am, could you spare anything? I'm trying to get to New Mexico to see my son. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me, sir could you spare a couple dollars? I'm sorry, not today, pal. How few, yet how they creep through my fingers to the deep while I weep. While I weep. Ghost. You got a letter, bro. God, can I not save one from the pitiless wave. Is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream?
