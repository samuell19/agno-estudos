(soft rising orchestral music) (thunder rumbles) (plucky orchestral music) - Don't even think about walking across the hall like that. Betsy doesn't have the time to follow you around willy nilly with a mop. - I'm sorry, I just have to get to my-- - No you don't. And I want those books put back in the library before your brother gets home. - But-- - Enough. - It was amazing out there. - I saw the lightning. - [Vanessa] The rain was lashing at my face, falling sideways. - You need to have a bath. - [John] Good morning m'lady. Excuse me. - No, I can take it. - Oh no m'lady, you're alright. - I can take it. - I'm not sure m'lady-- - It's for me, read the label. - [John] Well, if you're sure. - I am. Well anyway. (soft suspenseful orchestral music) (knock at door) Hello mother. - So this is where you set yourself up. - I need space for my instruments. - Your brother's invited a Captain Wilmington to shoot with him tomorrow. I want you to receive him with me before they go. He's a clever man Humphrey says. - Compared to whom? - Thank you for not being difficult. - Alright. - And perhaps you could wear the striped dress if it's dry by tomorrow. - I already apologized for getting it wet. - [Lady Kentworth] Yes. - It's just I lost track of time and I've been having problems with my rain gauges, but now I got one that-- - Enough. Oh for goodness sake, please wear the apron Betsy gave you when you're up here, it's filthy. I never could get your father to wear his apron when he was playing with his beetles. - Really? - 9:15 in the drawing room. - I have mathematics to do at nine, but I'll come when I'm finished. - You'll be in the drawing room at 9:15 ready to receive our guest. (plucky melancholy orchestral music) (faint church bells ring) (birds chirping) (soft orchestral music) - Can I help you? - Can I help you? - Perfectly fine, please carry on. - [Captain Wilmington] Begging your pardon my lady, but I'm not sure I could do that. I was always taught to help a lady in distress. - Not distressed, just busy. - What on earth are you doing? Are you stuck? - Bring me the napkins Betsy. No I want the lace edged ones. Hurry up please, he'll be here in a minute. - [Betsy] Sorry m'lady. - [Captain Wilmington] Please, it's dangerous. - There isn't the time. I have to take my measurements at nine, and it's ready past nine. - I'd never be able to live with myself if you were to break your neck and I had left you. - I apologize sir, but now if you'll-- - What measurements? - I must get to my rain gauge, and with all due respect sir, I cannot very well hold a conversation with you at the same time. - Get down miss, I'm sorry, but I really must insist. It's dreadfully high. - I will not. (soft plucky orchestral music) Please don't touch that! - Brain samples? - Measurements, detailed measurements. - Why would you put that up there? You climb trees every day? - [Vanessa] I have a ladder. - Really? - I had a ladder. - [Captain Wilmington] One of these rain jugs just isn't enough? - Well the amount of rainfall they collect is different. - The same rain falls in the same field. - Yes, but this rain gauge gets less than that one because of the wind and shelter and things. So you put them at different heights to test the difference. - So, yesterday that one got more? - [Vanessa] Yes. - Then why does it still have water in it? - Well, because I haven't taken a reading yet, of course. - Yes, that's much better. - Yes, sorry m'lady. - That's alright Betsy. - Could you pass me the measuring cylinder please, over there? Be careful. - Here we are. Well go on then. Measure away, I shall record it. - Five. Neatly though. - It was five yesterday. You could have saved yourself a trip. (thunder rumbles) I'm deadly serious now. This hobby will be the death of you. You don't want to be out in the storm. Ladies with head colds are not so attractive. Let me walk you home. - I can't go until I've reset them all. What are you doing? - [Captain Wilmington] Helping. - Oh, wait. - What is it? - No, no, don't do that. - Am I doing something wrong? - Well yes, I'm afraid. - [Captain Wilmington] Shall I just help you down? It would be my honor. - Vanessa? Vanessa? - Thank you. - Of course. I marked it. - Yes, but you wrote the wrong measurement. - It says four. - I'm sorry, but you read it wrong. You have to do the reading at eye level, otherwise you won't show the right measurement. Truly! What does it say? - Four and a half. - And you wrote four. - Alright. And that one? - No, I set that one today. Its first reading will be tomorrow. - So, does that mean it's time to go in? - Yes, I'm terribly late. Thank you for your help. - You're most welcome. - It's just, well, you weren't doing it right. - My apologies. I'll do better next time. - But thank you. I'm almost finished. Oh, thank you. - Of course. (Lady Kentworth breathing heavily) - Lady Vanessa I assume? - Pleased to meet you. And who may I ask? - Captain Fitzwilliam Wilmington at your service ma'am. - [Lady Kentworth] When I find you what I'll do with you! He'll be here in a minute and now there's no man to greet him! (thunder rumbles) Covered in mud like a (muttering) - Hello mother. May I present Captain Wilmington. Captain Wilmington, my mother Lady Kentworth. Shall we go inside, I think it's about to rain.
