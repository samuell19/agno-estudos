- She came after me again today asking me where her daughter is. That's the third time this week. Every time she comes I tell her it's closed adoption and I cannot give her the family's address. I know, no. I made it clear this time that I'm going to the police to file a restraining order. I'm heading to the station now so it'll be awhile before I get home. I'm gonna lose you, bye. Look, I don't know how else to tell you. We are not to have any contact. - Way to go Lacy! - That was amazing! - My goodness, yay! - Hey, that's your first time without training wheels. - It's a milestone. - What's a milestone? - It's a memory that we celebrate. - Yeah. - I want to celebrate mommy. - I know you do little bird. - You know, I think I know just the way. Grilled cheese. - Yeah. - Man, you and your grilled cheese. Come on.. - Hey. Little bird, slow down. I thought I taught you how to appreciate flavors. - Well what if we just appreciate them really fast? - How come I'm your little bird? - Well, that's because you flew into our hearts like a perfect little bird and we chose you right then and there. - I thought you chose me because of my eyelashes? - Well, your eyelashes are truly amazing but actually... We chose each other. - Babe are you okay? - Yeah, I'm just um, stressed. You know? Lacy's starting school and the opening, it's um, it's a lot. - Well, is there anything I can do to help? - Maybe you can make us another grilled cheese while you think about it mom. - Maybe you could chew your food. If only all my customers were this easy to please? - Well, it's going to be perfect. You just, you have to pace yourself. - Okay, all I have to do is save the world, open a restaurant and feed a seven and a half year old and her daddy. Seconds, who's in? BLT on rye with garlic truffle fries. Portobello mushroom with tomato bisque. Here you go. - We're already packed and it's a soft open. Dirk Vole, eat your heart out. - Ricardo, you got those burgers working? - You betcha. - Hey Mark. When you guys coming? Okay I'll be right there. Ricardo, you got this? - Yeah, looks like the rush is over. - Cool, I'll be right back. - Cool. - Sorry! Sorry. - You scared me so bad. - We couldn't resist. - Ta da! - What did you do? - I don't know, what did we do? - They're McKnives mom. - No, they are MAC Knives and they're the best knives in the entire world. That's too much Mark. - Well we thought that the top trending chef needs the top of the line knives. - Well, speaking of that, we can take a selfie. Come on guys. One, two, three. - Say McKnives! - Yay! - McKnives! - Best chef ever says husband and daughter. #merchantkitchen, #proudmama. - So sayeth the queen of social media. - Well, maybe a glorified princess. - Anyways tease all you want. All of these followers could be potential customers. Like this Tanya Jones. She could be an interviewer. She could be a potential investor. - Or a housewife from Ohio. - Whoever she is, she just helped me crack 10,000 followers. - Wow, can you say big numbers little bird? - Big numbers. - Let's get you somethin' to eat. - Come on. - Okay wait, this is the perfect spot for a first day of school selfie. - Yeah! - Everybody get in. One, two, three. - Grilled cheese! - Yay! Birdie, I am so proud of you. It's such a big day. First day of second grade. - I'm a pro, mom. - Of course you are. - Go. - You must be Mister and Missus Peters? - Wow, how did you know? - Social media. - Well I guess that weeds out all the psychos. - Yeah, well most of them right? - Stop it. Um, this is our daughter Lacy. - Hi Lacy, I'm Miss Annie. Do you want me to show you where the new classroom is? - Sure. - Come on. - Daddy? - Right. - Can I have one more big hug? Have the best day okay? - I love you mommy. - I love you too. - Love you daddy. - Love you. - Okay, let's go meet your new classmates. - Bye. - Bye. - That's so cute. - She seems nice. - Yeah. - Yeah. - She's gonna be okay right? - She's gonna be totally fine. - Okay. - And 'kay, we can't see them. Now we're creepy. We gotta go. - Come on. Famous chef recognized again in public. Look at you. - Yeah, I must be. - You're so famous. - My God! - That was really good. - That was amazing. - You've got a really good arm. - Woo! - Tough game. - Great game. That was fun. We should do this more often. - Well, normally at this time I'm up to my elbows in truffle oil and Burrata. - Yeah, it's hard to believe the workaholic took the day off. - Well I had to, it's Lacy's first day of school. - How was drop off? Do you wanna see? - Super cute. - I know right? I forgot to post it. Proud mama. - That doesn't worry you? I mean you post a lot of pictures of Lacy. - Is that a problem? - Well you know what they say. - Who's they? - People you know, like the internet people. - There are internet people? - Yeah the creepers, stalkers, trolls. - Lions and tigers and bears my. - Okay, shut up. They say you shouldn't over post because all those psychos and predators can find them. - Who's looking for Lacy? Listen I'm proud of my daughter and I want to, I don't know, share it. Is that okay internet police? - Okay. - Okay great. Let's go get something to eat. I'm starving. - For sure. - So little bird, you make any new friends? - Well, Miss Annie's really nice and I like Sophia but Alex was really mean. - Hey, little bird, if this Alex kid is mean to you you can just kill him with kindness. - What does that mean? - Well, if he says something to you that's not very nice, you say something to him that's very nice. It'll confuse him 'cause it doesn't give him any ammunition. Does that make sense? - I think so. - Okay, well if that doesn't work then I will just punch him right in the guts. - Vanessa. - I'm only kidding. I'm kidding. What? - Nothing. - What did you say? - Nothing at all. Just a little short hand between me and my goddaughter. - Wait, stay right there. I'll get a picture of the godfather on little bird's first day of school. Cheese. Little bird's godfather. Little bird's godfather. Little bird's godfather. - What are you still doin' here? - I have to work if this place is gonna be successful. - You need to learn how to delegate, rely on other people. Like Colin. He's not doin' nothin'. - Hey, leave Colin alone. And I rely on you Ricardo. Couldn't do any of this without you. - You're the one that makes the magic happen. I just take directions really well, and I'm super sexy. - That you are. Just um, I don't want to let anyone down, you know? Just waited so long to have a family that when we finally did get to adopt Lacy, my life went into overdrive. Just don't want to miss any of the important stuff you know? - Listen to me, you are a wonderful mom to that girl. Just know that you're showing Lacy dreams can come true. - I hope so. She's just everything to me. - Go home. Put Lacy to bed. I got this. - Really? I don't know what I would do without you Ricardo. - Well, you'd have nothing pretty to look at that's for sure. - Goodnight handsome. I'll see you tomorrow. - See ya tomorrow. - Hey? Got a light? - Hey, what's up? - Forgot my lighter. - Yeah, yeah sure. No problem. - Ricardo! He must have been attacked behind the restaurant. He's dead! Mark he's dead! - Hey. - Hey. - Come here. How you holdin' up? - I'm so exhausted. I can't work another double. - I know. - How's Lacy? - She's asleep. - I'm sorry. - No, no it's fine. She's okay. She's still a little sad but she's strong just like her mom, okay? We'll get through this. - I'm so sorry. - No, no, you have nothing to apologize for. We just need to find you some help for the restaurant. - I know, but I just don't think anyone's gonna be good enough. - It's because nobody's Ricardo. - I know. I just miss him, you know? I just don't understand this. You know? How can there be no suspects, no leads, nothing? - I know. But they'll find the person that did this. There's always something. Look just for now, why don't we go through these again? We'll keep digging. There's bound to be a golden resume in there somewhere. Alright? - Right. It says here you're a food model? Your hobbies include knife work. Cool. - So you got some real winners? - Yeah. No one's ever gonna replace Ricardo. - No one ever will but you need to find someone great and a sign in the window won't cut it. Do you mind if I try? - Yes, please get this off my hands. - Okay. What qualifications do you want? How about a sense of humor? - That's a good idea. - Now all we need is a picture. Um, actually, um, excuse me do you mind if I... Now we just have to airdrop it and, voila. Expect your replies to come flooding in. - Thank you so much. How do you know all this? - I'm a millennial. It's what we do. - It's like I feel her in my DNA. - It's definitely morphed in there, genetics aside. - Yeah. - Has she ever asked? - About her birth parents? No. But Mark and I are really open with her about it. I mean they're kind of a mystery to us too. There's no father on record and the mother chose to remain anonymous. We just try to stress that, you know, we were meant to be together and with us she's home, forever. - Chelsea, Chelsea come play. - Okay. - Wait, but no jumping off! - I only do that with daddy anyways and it's a secret. - What? I'm gonna have to have a chat with your dad about that. - How high can you get? - Probably higher than you. - Okay, well let's see. - When you wish you had all the time in the world. Heidi, you are a millennial genius. - There we go. - Hey babe. - I think I found someone. - Okay and you seem excited. - Well, I think she's kinda perfect. She's a single mom. She's done every job from host to busing. She really gets the business. - Okay, and can she cook? Wow. - Yeah. Right? - You know I think she might be a little bit too good to cook for you. - Shut up. They were rescued from the goblins and lived happily ever after. - Mommy, there's goblins outside. - Well, you're the first person I interviewed who brought me a sample. - I figured samples right up front would save everyone time, plus bribery. - Well, you know, you had me at your resume, and this tart is truly next level so this is really just a pants meeting. - What's a pants meeting? - You know when someone looks so good on their resume that you just want to make sure they're not crazy? They wear pants to the meeting. - Well, these are tearaways so I'm just gonna ditch them as soon as I get hired. - Thank God you're joking. That's good. I could use someone around here that can make me laugh. We have so much to do before the grand opening. - Yeah, it's important to make work fun when you're stressed. - Yeah, seriously. We've got a huge review in a few weeks. - What critic? - Have you heard of Dirk Vole? He's tough. And you play tennis. - I was 11th on my team. - How many people were there on your team? - 11. Yeah. Apparently loving the sport isn't exactly the same as being good at it. - Why do you want this job? - I just moved here. My husband just left me for his yoga instructor in the world's most cliche move. - I'm sorry. - Well my daughter and I are better off without him. - What's her name? - Patrice. - Wow. What a really beautiful and unusual name. - Thank you. - I have a daughter as well. - So yeah, I get it. You want to spend as much time with her as you can. They grow up so fast. - I know. You're hired. - Really? - Really. When can you start? - Now, just let me get out of these pants. - That's like your third one. - It's my fourth actually but who's counting? - I am apparently. Alright. So tell me about the genius behind these eclairs. - She's shy, quiet, reserved. - So pretty much the exact opposite of you? - Ha. - Ha. - Hey. - No, she's great. She um, she has a sense of humor which is nice. I can't touch her desserts and she makes an amazing cheesecake. - I love cheesecake. - I know you do. - Lacy loves cheesecake. The world loves cheesecake. - You're gonna love Taryn. - Well, I already love her and her eclairs because it got my wife home to me and my little birdie at a decent hour. - And she has a daughter around Lacy's age. - No way. - Yeah. Maybe they can have a play date sometime. - Sure. As long as she brings cheesecake. - Patrice? Dinner's almost ready. Patrice? Patrice? Dinner's almost ready. You still mad? Mama got a new job today and I made your favorite cheesecake tarts to celebrate. Okay, well when you're done pouting, then you can come get something to eat. - Portobello mushroom sandwich with fries up. - Chili prawns and sweet potato fries up. - Cod burger and fries up. - You guys are so cute. You're like long lost sisters. - I always wanted a sister. - Aw. - Does this mean I get to borrow all your clothes? - No, it means you don't get to read my diary. - I forgot I was supposed to call Mark. - When do I get to meet that guy? - I don't know. Do you and Patrice wanna come over this weekend? - She's with her dad but I'd love to. - It's a date. - Great. - Hey. - I'm a little early. - No, no worries. Come on in. Well actually, I'm behind because - I can help if you want. - No, no, that's not what I meant. You are in guest mode tonight. I think that Mark and Lacy are upstairs. Mark! - No, I'll introduce myself. - Okay. - Yep. - Thanks. - Mommy? Hi, are you Taryn? - Yeah I am. You must be Lacy. - Yep. I heard you like cheesecake. - It's like my favorite thing. - Well I made this special just for you. You can have dessert before dinner, right? - Probably not. - Well then let's call it an appetizer. Or actually, let's call it a friendship tart and if you get in trouble you can just blame it on me. 'Kay? It will be our secret though. Deal? - You must be Taryn? - Hey. - Hi. Mark. - Pleasure to meet you. - Likewise. I see you've met Lacy. - Yes. - Dinner's ready. You guys ready? - Well, she might be asleep by Tuesday but I'm not making any promises. - Here, I'll help you. - No, no. - No, no, no. - You're not allowed to help. - No, no. - You're a guest, okay? Besides, I'm gonna make Mark put on his apron and do his clean up dance later. - Oo. You know some people don't appreciate poetry in motion. - It is, it's poetry though. - Well, I bet you're a great dancer but I am gonna get going. - Aw, really? - Yeah, but thank you. This was really nice. - Thanks for coming. - Okay. Good night. - Drive safe. - Bye. - See, she's nice. - Yeah. - Yeah? - No, she's great. You know what? I'm gonna grab a book. I'll get mine too. - My name is Phil Amhurst. I'm a parole officer. - Hey that food critic you mentioned isn't coming today is he? - No thank goodness. I wanted to be officially open for a couple weeks before he came in. You know, find a rhythm? He has an opening in his schedule in two weeks. - What was his name again? - Dirk Vole. - Right. Did you know it was gonna be this busy? - Grand openings always are. I'm just happy I have someone as capable as you to help me. - That's nice of you to say. - By the time Dirk Vole shows up, we'll be a well oiled machine. - He is gonna love us. - Serrated? - Serrated? - Are my chili shrimp up? - Thanks. - Order up. - To Ricardo. - To Ricardo. - He woulda loved this. - Goodnight you two. - Taryn, we're celebrating. Come, have a glass with us. - No, I don't drink. - I'm sorry I didn't know. No, it's not like that I just, I have a young daughter. I need to keep my wits about me. - Sure. - I don't mean, I don't mean you, I just mean Patrice needs my full attention. - Of course. Yeah. Speaking of Patrice, Lacy's been asking for a play date and we're going to the park on Sunday. Do you want to join us? - Patrice's dad has been being difficult and she's not adjusting as well as I'd hoped. - I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do to help? - No, no, no. I could use a distraction though. Well, of course. Why don't you join us? - That'd be great. - Okay. - Okay. - See you then. - Good night. - Tina? Is that you? It's Ginny. Weird seeing you on the outside. - You've got the wrong person. - The slide. Okay, let's do the slide. Wait but first... - What's your favorite color? - No, what's your favorite color? - Purple. I like blue but purple's still best. - Okay, well let me tell you something about purple. Purple's for royalty. Really? Like a queen? Yes. Only queens are allowed to wear it. So maybe you're descended from royalty. - Well, I'm adopted so maybe my birth mom's a queen. - Maybe she is. And that would make you a princess. And guess what? My favorite color's purple. Aw. - Taryn's great I mean she's so good with her. - She is. She can cook and babysit? Ae? - You smell so good. I wish I could just take you home. - Woo! Mom, Taryn says I'm a purple princess. - Be careful! - This one doesn't have a name. Well she's a princess so she should have a very special name. How 'bout Patrice? It sounds royal. - Your daughter's name? Would that be okay? - I think she'd love it. - Then Princess Patrice it is. Now we have to do battle. - Someone has to protect the kingdom from the goblins. - That sounds scary. Tell me about these goblins. - My mom and I call anything that is scary a goblin, like when I was nervous for school, it was a tummy goblin and I wished it away. These goblins eat people and they and they can hide as any form they want. - Well then how do you tell them apart from the rest of the people of Burtonia. - Of Burtonia. - Jinx! - Jinx. If you have the secret potion you can see them and then destroy them with a spell. Well I think that she still needs a knight to protect her. - Let's call her Taryn the Bold. - She will be Taryn the Bold then, Princess Patrice. And Taryn the Bold will always protect the princess no matter what. 'Kay, it's time for bed. - 10 more minutes. - No, next time I promise. Come on. There you go. - Good night Taryn. - Good night Patrice. - Thank you. Well, why don't we go get the card, you too finish up here? - Aw, thanks babe. - You're very welcome. - He's cute, right? - He's very cute. Good pick. Yeah. - You realize that this is your first adult night since the restaurant opened? - I needed it. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that wasn't animated. - I can't remember the last time we went on a double date. - Before Lacy. - See this is why I'm never having children because I can't give up my R rated movies and red wine. - Did I tell you Taryn doesn't drink. She said it was because she wants to be able to focus on her child. - Well she's certainly focused on Lacy. - Well, Taryn is the reason I could come out tonight. You know? Free babysitting. - Yeah, but what about her kid? - Well we got lucky. Patrice is with her ex tonight so she can sit with Lacy. I don't know. She says that being with Lacy helps her miss Patrice less. Which is nice. - See ya. - Bye Taryn. - Taryn? - Yeah? - I'm Chelsea, Vanessa's bestie. - Hi. - She talks about you all the time. Vanessa's training me for tennis in a bit. We could make doubles. Wanna come? - No, I don't play. - Really? Nessa said you played. - Yeah I did I just don't anymore. I gotta go. - I know it's you Tina. So what? You're too good for your old cell block pals? - No, it's just crazy seeing you here. - So now you recognize me. - Taryn, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. It was great to see you. Bye. Bye, Taryn. - Your usual pre-game coffee. - Sure. - Hey you okay? - Yeah. - Your face doesn't read okay. - What do we know about Taryn? - She makes killer desserts. - No I mean, what do we really know about her? - Not much. Then again I don't know much about anyone. I don't really pay attention to be honest with you. - Nevermind, it's nothing. - Hello? - Hi, is this Dirk Vole's office? - Yes. - Hi, this is Vanessa from the Merchant Kitchen. Yeah. Um, well we actually have a private event scheduled the day he was supposed to visit and I'm wondering if we can reschedule? That'd be perfect. Thank you so much. Okay. - What's goin' on? - I hate that you're working this much. - We talked about this. I have to work to make this place work. - And I would never have agreed to this if I'd known that you weren't gonna get support. - I have Taryn. - Yeah and thank God for Taryn, right? But don't you think you're relying on her - Okay wait I'm confused. You want me to have support but you don't want me to have support from Taryn? - She sees you more than we do. - Where is this coming from? - I don't know. I miss you. Okay? We both miss you. - I miss you too. I'm sorry. I really am. It's just, this review could literally make us or break us and if it goes well, - I know. - then it puts us on the map, okay? - Happy anniversary. It's number 10. - I'm sorry. - They say that a traditional 10th anniversary present should be tin or aluminum. And they say that the pliability of aluminum symbolizes how a successful marriage needs to be flexible and durable. How it can bend and not break. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I forgot our anniversary. And I promise, I won't let this restaurant break us. I just need you to bend for just a little while longer just until this review comes through and then I promise I will make it up to you. - Why is it that I'm always the one that needs to bend? It's until I break, right? - Here little bird. Come on, that flat tire really set us back. - I'm zipping up my bag. - I know, I know but mommy's got to get to work baby. - Why can't Taryn do it for you? - Well Taryn's a really big help but mommy has to be there too sweetie. - You're always busy. - I know, that's 'cause things are really great honey but a big reviewer's coming tomorrow and mommy's got to prepare so I need you to hurry. - Okay but don't forget, my story share time is on Friday and you promised you'd go and I wrote a story about... - Lacy! I gotta go baby. I'm so sorry. I love you. I'm so sorry baby. Have a good day. What? What? No! I'll be right there. I thought he said he wasn't coming today. - Well, he is and he's sitting out there and he's ordered everything. - Now he wants the chili shrimp. - I'm so happy you're here. - Let's get five stars. Is he frowning? - I don't know. - There you are. - What did he say? - I don't know, a lot of 's. - What does that mean? - I don't know but they sounded positive. - I'm really nervous. - I know, I know. - What does it look like to you? - Well he's still eating. - Okay Heidi, what does a positive sound like? - Well, he's writing, he's eating, he's, maybe, okay I'm gonna go drop the check. Okay, so I don't want to get everybody's hopes up but the hostess told me that on the way out she apparently heard Dirk saying he was gonna give us five stars. - Well, well, well I guess the 's were a good thing. - I guess they were a great thing. The review comes out next week. - I am so proud of you babe. - Well, proud of us. I couldn't have done it without you Taryn. We need a selfie. Come here. - Let me take it of the two of you. - You have to be in it. You're like family now. - I don't wanna be on social media. My ex is... - Okay, then I'll just take it for us and hang it in the restaurant. Come on. - Go, I'll take it. - Come on. - Thanks Heidi. - You're welcome. - Okay. - Okay. And three, two, one. There you go. - I'll be right back. - Thank you. - Actually you know what? I'm gonna go do some cleaning in the back, okay? - Thanks Heidi. - Thanks. - She's perfect. - I am so proud of you. - Thank you. - That's amazing. - I know. - You've earned that. See? - Excuse me. Mrs. Peters? My name's Detective Burgess, I'm leading the investigation into Ricardo Gomez. I'd like to get some information. Is now a good time? - Of course, anything I can do to help? - I just want to verify what you told the other officers. You left the restaurant at approximately 11 p.m. The bystander said he found the body of Mr. Gomez at around 11. - I'm sorry sir, are you saying whoever did this was here at the same time as I was? - It's hard to tell. Have you or your employees seen anything suspicious since? Someone hangin' around late at night, even a bad feeling could be worth a follow up. - No. I haven't seen anyone. Have you honey? - No. Nothing. - I can ask um, Heidi or Taryn. They work for me. Heidi? Taryn? - Hey. - Heidi this Detective just wants to ask you a few questions about Ricardo. Where's Taryn? - She said that she had to go check up on Patrice. - Detective Burgess, please have a seat. - The night was perfect until the detective showed up. - And he just questioned you? No new information? - No new information. He questioned Mark and me and Heidi and, he wanted to question Taryn but she took off but she doesn't even know Ricardo so... - Nessa, I'm just gonna say it. I, I don't trust Taryn. I just know there's something up with her. She has no listings. There's no social media. It's just off. She's off. - Chelsea, no social media does not equal a prison record okay? She's just a single mom trying to raise her kid. You have no idea how difficult that can be. - Ouch. So, because I don't know what it's like to raise a kid I can't be in your special club? - Chelsea, that's not what I said, okay? Listen, the only reason that I get to be here right now is because of Taryn. I just want you to be happy for me. - I'll be sure to thank her. Shoot I lost track of time. Shouldn't you be at the school? Lacy's story time starts in an hour. - No, Lacy said that it was on Friday. - No, I left a message with you yesterday. The school sent home a note when I picked her up saying it got bumped to today. - Chelsea I didn't get that message. - I left it with Taryn. She said she was gonna tell you. - Okay, enough! - I can't believe that. - Do not blame Taryn for your screw up. I can't believe this. - I didn't screw this up. - I'm gonna have to call Mark to see if he can make it. God. - Hey babe, how did the story go? - I just found out about story time right now. Can you make it? - No, I'm on my way to meet a client right now. Yeah no, I thought you said that you wanted... - I know what I said Mark. Why does it feel like I have to do everything? I have to go. - Lacy? - Did you tell her? - Lacy, baby I'm so sorry I missed your story but was it amazing? I mean, I bet it was amazing. How'd it go? - Well at first I was scared, then Taryn the Bold walked in and then everybody laughed at the right times and I got lots of claps. - That's so great. I'm so sorry I missed it but it's a good thing that Taryn was here. - Yeah I didn't want to intrude but... - Well Chelsea said... - I had to go home to Patrice, yeah. I left a note right on the counter. - Well, I didn't see it. I didn't see it. How was story time? - I'm just having a day. You know? - Can me and Taryn go get ice cream? - Well Taryn has to get back to work. But I can take you for some ice cream and how 'bout this? You can tell me your story four times. - I love you. E Taryn the Bold. - Bye. - Come on birdie. Let's go. - I'll see ya tomorrow. - Okay, have a good night. - We have some business to discuss Tina. - What's that? - How 'bout we start with you trying to pin that lawyer's death on me. - Just take it easy. - Last I checked that was a major parole violation. Do I need to make a call? - What do you want? - What I always wanted roomie. A little financial compensation for the hardship of knowing you. - Yeah, I don't have any. - You have a game goin'. You always have a game goin' Tina. Find it. - I don't have any money. - Three days. Then I come into your fancy restaurant and tell your boss all about my old cell mate Tina. I'm guessing Taryn didn't include that on her application or I could just phone that parole board. - Good night Taryn. - Hey Ness? Hey. - Hey. Hey Mark. Um, I know things have been really tough lately and you haven't been happy. - What? - Vanessa doesn't understand you, and you need a wife who understands you. You know? - Whoa! - A mother who understands how to be a mother. Mark! - What is going on here? - No! This isn't what it looks like at all. She just... - I have to go. - Vanessa, no, this... What was that? Ness? Nessa! - Soon baby. Comin' home soon. Momma's gotta hurry this up. - Hi. Hi, good morning. - You want me to walk you in birdie? - No thanks mommy, I got this. No tummy goblins. - Okay. - Love you. - Love you too. Whoops. There you go. Have a great day! - Your highness. - Taryn the Bold. - You wanna go fight some goblins. - What about school? - School doesn't care about goblins. Come on. Let's start with a pizza goblin. Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. - Taryn called. Patrice is sick so she won't be in today. - Great, just perfect. Turkey avocado on brioche. Double grilled cheese Reuben with sweet potato fries. Okay. - Sorry I'm late. - Mrs. Peters, what are you doing here? - Lacy? - Hi Mr. Robinson, go ahead. - Where's Lacy? - She didn't come to school today. - I dropped her off! - I didn't see her. - Why didn't anyone call me? - I'm sorry, I... - Mark, I need you to get ahold of that detective right now. Taryn kidnapped Lacy. - What, what are you talking about? - Lacy's gone, so is Taryn. That's no coincidence. Please! Just get the detective. - This is the same Taryn James that works for you? - Yes, but she's just not who I thought... - Has she picked up Lacy before? - Yes but I didn't tell... So you're sure this isn't just a misunderstanding? - Detective Burgess, I did not give Taryn permission to pick up my daughter from school today. - But you have in the past? - Yes, but I... - And would you say she's a friend? - Yes, but there was... - I went to the restaurant to speak with Vanessa and when I got there, Taryn was there and she made a very strong pass at me and then when Vanessa walked in it, nothing happened, you know that. - No, I know. I just, what if something happens to her? - No, nothing's gonna happen to her. Taryn loves Lacy. She'd never hurt a hair on her head. - Have you called her? - Yes! Taryn? Yes, I've called her many times and I've left several messages. - Look, Mrs. Peters technically Lacy isn't even missing yet. - A friend picked her up from school this morning, but considering the activity around you in the restaurant, I'll paid a visit to Taryn James. - Thank you, thank you. Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Hi. Great. There you go, keep the change. Pizza time! - Yay. - Hey I have an idea. Why don't we go eat this in bed and read some scary stories? - Mommy and daddy would never let me eat in the bed. - Well that's not very much fun is it? We can do anything we want here. - Good evening. My name is Detective Burgess. I'm looking for a Taryn James. Does she live at this address? - And tomorrow you get to meet Patrice. What do you say you take this into the bedroom and I'll follow you with the plates? - Okay. - Okay? You're up early. - Where did you get Princess Patrice and my blankets from? - They're Patrice's. You like all the same things. Are you okay? - I miss my mommy. - Well, I'm here for you. - I want my real mommy. - Well, I already told you, Vanessa and Mark are celebrating and they don't want you there. But we're gonna have a great day. We're going to watch movies and we're gonna bake something special. I tell you what, when Patrice gets home then you can call Vanessa and Mark, okay? - Really? - Really. But right now, I need help baking my famous cheesecake. Do you know anyone who could help me with that? - Yes I do. - You do? Let's go. - I'm sorry I was so selfish and I didn't believe you. - She fooled everyone. - I mean I know that they have a special bond but just to take her, it just seems so... - It's weird, psychotic, deranged. You don't just take a child that isn't yours. - What'd you say? - Weird, psychotic. - No. You don't just take a child that isn't yours. - Wait a minute, you don't think... - I don't know. She had no motive. I mean, we were friends. It almost seems like she tracked us down. - But I thought the adoption was closed? - It is, I can't open it until Lacy's 18. - So then how did she find you? - I don't know. But I gotta find out. - You need to call the detective. - No, he's not sharing anything with me and the sooner we follow this lead, the sooner we find Lacy. Let's go. - Normally we wouldn't be allowed to share any information with you because this was a closed adoption... - Yes but my daughter... - Is missing. I'm aware. That's the reason you're even sitting here. In cases of child endangerment or harm we are permitted to share information with the authorities or concerned parties. Mrs. Peters, this particular case is very disturbing. It's one of the reasons I asked to take the case over and to meet with you in person. - Please, anything that you can do to help us. - Okay. But this isn't gonna be easy for you. - My daughter is missing and I believe that the woman that took her is her biological mother. Please, anything that you can do to help us I would really appreciate it. - Alright. Tina Jenson, Lacy's biological mother, has a long history of misdemeanors and mental health issues dating back to adolescence. Her mental state really seemedo deteriorate right after she surrendered her daughter at birth. This could've been compounded by post-partum but, she was admitted to county six separate times after Lacy's birth. Three years after she gave Lacy up, she walked into our downtown office and stabbed the initial case worker on the adoption file eight times before she was restrained. - My, my God did she, did she die? - Thankfully, the woman survived. Tina was sent to jail where she stopped eating and was put on suicide watch. She agreed to eat as long as she was given library access and kitchen duty which she did without incident. Three months ago Tina and another inmate Ginny Garretti were paroled one month before the brutal murder of the lawyer who handled your adoption. Evidence pointed to Garretti but she had an air tight alibi so, Tina's the main suspect. - Chels? - I know. - A month ago, I hired her to work in my restaurant. She's been in my house. She's babysat my child. - Don't beat yourself up Mrs. Peters. Tina Jenson is a master manipulator, a sociopath in every sense of the word. Her files indicate severe psychosis with a tendency toward delusion. - Well then how the hell did she get paroled? - She played the system. She knew what to say, how to say it and to whom. Unfortunately some slip through the cracks. I wish it were different. - I have to find my daughter. The police say they're doing what they can but, are there any relatives, any contacts in there from before? Anything that you can give us? - No living relatives on file. You can try Ginny Garretti. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Hey baby. - Mark, where are you? - The meeting ran late. I just got home now. Detective Burgess asked for a picture of Taryn and we've got the one we took at the restaurant. So I'll go over now. - No, I need to just stay home in case she comes back or they need you. - I'm gonna head straight home right after the restaurant. When are you gonna be home? - Well Chelsea and I are gonna spend the night here. We're gonna follow up on a lead tomorrow. - Okay. - I have to pull every thread okay? I have to find her. I love you. - Okay. I love you. - When is she coming? - Do you know what we're celebrating? Patrice is coming home. She's been gone a very long time. - Aren't we waiting? It's not my birthday. - Blow out the candles, yes it is. Now blow out the candles before they drip wax on the cake. - Aren't... - Blow 'em out Patrice. Do what your mommy says. - You're not my mommy and I'm not Patrice. I want my mommy. - I am your mommy and this person is not. - I'm gonna come back. You draw a picture of your real mommy and when you've learned your lesson you can have some cake. Honey I'm sorry. I know this is confusing. But it's gonna get easier because you're where you'resupposed to be now. It's me Taryn the Bold. I'm protecting you from the people who want to hurt you. And I'm your mommy too. I love you Patrice. You know you could be a little kinder to me. You know we've been friends for a long time and now I have this good news to share with you that I'm your mom, and you stop being my friend. - I just want my mommy. Please. - Hello? - You weren't supposed to be here. I didn't want to hurt you Mark but, you weren't supposed to be here. - Taryn, just... - Stay away from me and my daughter. - Just give her back. - Tina was always goin' on and on about her daughter Patrice. - Do you know where she is? Patrice? Yeah. - No. Tina didn't have a picture of her though. I always thought that was weird. What mom doesn't have a picture of her kid? - Ginny, my daughter is missing and I think that Taryn or Tina, whatever, she might have her. Do you have any idea where she is? - Not specifically. Tina was a great cook though. Worked in the kitchen, always sneaked me extra. - Do you know where she worked? - Course. - Okay here. Here, look. It's all I have. See? - She was at some place out east near Blue Creek Rock. Winkey's, Wooley's, Webby's? Famous for apple pie or cheesecake. You know, she used to live near there in the woods. If you find Winkey's you'll probably find Tina. No matter where she went she'd always end up there pickin' up a shift or two. - Thank you. Thank you Ginny. - Hey, I got your text. She said it was Winkey's? - Or Wooley's. I don't know, it was fuzzy and I'm outta cash. - Okay well there's no Winkey's or Wooley's within 20 minutes of here and there's like 15 W cafes. - Then we have to check all 15. - Yeah. - Hold on. - Mark... Who is this? My God. Yeah. I'll be right there. Mark's in the hospital. - My God, do you want me to drive you? - No, I, I got... - It's okay, it's okay. There's a car rental place just around the corner. I'll go get a car and I'll check out all the W restaurants. - Are you sure? - Yeah. That's what best friends do. - Thank you so much Chelsea. - Call me after you talk to Mark and then I'll let you know if I find anything. I promise you Nessa we'll fi her. - Okay. Michael Crawford, 340. Michael Crawford please call 340. - Excuse me, I'm looking for the Peters family. Thank you. Excuse me, Mrs. Peters can I see you? - Yes, Detective. - I just want to review some of the things you've told me so far. You're saying she took your daughter, disappeared or never truly existed, ran off to the woods but popped back real quick to break your husband's leg and lock him in a walk in freezer. Is that about it? - Did you just bring your notebook over to mock me? Is that about it? - Mrs. Peters, I've told you before, the address she's been using doesn't exist. All traces of her lead to a dead end. The moment she walked outta prison, Tina Jenson walked out of existence and it's hard to track a ghost. - Isn't that your job? - You're making my job more difficult by interfering in my investigation. - What investigation? Listen, this is my daughter. I'm gonna find her. - Again, I implore you do not get involved in an active investigation. - Well then we have no problem 'cause this investigation is anything but active, right? - Excuse me? - Excuse mDetective I have to talk to my husband's doctor. - I'll be in touch. Sorry. - The break was fairly clean but he did suffer some pretty extreme hypothermia from prolonged exposure in the walk in freezer. - I should've been there. I should've beenhere. - Look, at the end of the day he's gonna be fine Mrs. Peters. Right now, your husband just needs to rest. - What should I do? - Just go home. I'll give you a call. You might be able to come back tonight, at the latest tomorrow. - Tor. Taryn's scared Chels. If she's resorted to sending me threatening texts then she's panicking. - I've hit like 16 W restaurants. Waverly's, Wilby's, Woody's. I even stopped at a Wendy's and nothing. - Keep looking. - I will, I promise. I'm gonna hit every single one. How are you holding up? - I have to find her Chels. - I know, we will. - How could I have been so stupid? - You're not stupid Vanessa. You're just a loving person who thought she was doing a good thing. - Wait. - Why, what? What happened? - It's Willy's off of Highway 16. - I'm like 20 minutes away from there. I'll call you when I get there. - Bye. - How are we doing? My brave sweet princess. You don't have to be scared of anything anymore. You know why? - Because I'm brave. - No, because you have me. And who am I? - You're Taryn the Bold. - That's right. I'm gonna protect you from anything. You know that right? - I, I guess. - No there's no guessing. You know, I'm gonna protect you from anything. And we're always gonna have each other, right Patrice? - Yes. - Yes what? - Yes mommy. - That's right. That's my girl. Don't even think about that other mommy, your old mommy. She's not your real mommy and she does not love you as much as I do. And you didn't know that, it's okay. Hey, we have a kingdom to rule together. Don't we? - Yes Taryn. - Yes mommy! - Yes mommy. - I love you Patrice. Mommy has some work to do. I'll be back soon. Nothing. Tina Jenson. Nothing. Damn it Taryn, where are you? Did you find it? It's definitely off the beaten path but the sign says it's closed. I think I'm still gonna check it out though. How's Mark? - He's gonna be fine. - Good. Okay, I'll text you. - Thanks.

Stop acting like you're her mother. You're not! I'm her mother! You need to leave us alone! - Mommy? - She is not your mommy! Okay? I am! Sit down! If I can't have her, no one will. Do you understand? You stole her from me. Did you know that? She stole you from me when you were a baby. She is the goblin. - Tina, I can't even imagine what you've been through. - No you can't. - I can't understand what it would feel like to have your, your daughter taken from you. And how it would break your heart every day to be apart from her. - You do not know what it means to be a mother. You can't even have kids. You stole one. - I know, and that was wrong. I apologize. But I just, I just wanted a family so bad and I see now that she's your family. - She's mine. - I understand that now. I really do. - You do? - I do. Tina the last thing in the world I would ever want to do is separate a mother from her daughter and, I mean I can see how hard you've worked to get her back. - You have no idea. I had to get rid of your sous chef. - Ricardo? - Your friend. Your husband. - You did what um, um, what you had to do. You did what a mother had to do. I just, I want what's best for Patrice and um, I see that she's happiest with you. And um, I just need to know what you need Tina. From me. Honey I need you to die. - No! Mommy no! - Okay. Okay. - Well that would scare Patrice, don't you think? - Then I need you to leave us alone and never come back. - Okay. Um, but just saying goodbye is gonna be so hard. - Run Lacy! - No! No! - No!
