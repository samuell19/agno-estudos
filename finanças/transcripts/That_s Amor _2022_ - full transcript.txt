Here you go. Here you go. All yours, Sofia. - Sorry, what am I supposed to... - Not my problem. Mm. Miss Dunham. Oh, Sofia. Wonderful. Can you get me an espresso before I pass out looking at the god-awful logos that corporate sent over? I don't know why they insist on doing my job for me. There's not a creative mind in the entire bunch. Yeah. Yeah, Miss... Uh, yeah, I can do that for you. Um... Before I do that, I... I was also wondering, uh... I... I thought that I... - I thought that... - Oh my God, spit it out. So, I've been your assistant for, like, two years now? Or a little over two years, and, um, I just thought it was time to talk about, you know, the fa... the fact that my job is, um, answering phones and proofing and scheduling, and I don't actually get to do any graphic design. I hired you to be my assistant, not my protégé. And I thought you understood that when you took the job. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did. Uh... I just thought that if I could show you that I could handle more responsibility then something might fall to me. There's an entire office full of people with master's degrees waiting for something to open up for them. So I don't think anything is going to fall to one of my assistants. Yeah, okay, uh... So, what do I do? Hmm. Oh, love. I'm gonna do you a favor. Thank you. Oh, wow. I really appreciate it. I'm gonna let you go. Sorry, what? Yeah, two years is way too long to be somebody's assistant. Most people leave the job after six months. How old are you? I turn 30 tomorrow. Ew. You are way too old to be answering phones. You know, there's something for you out there, but it's not here. So, I'm going to ask you to reconsider. I don't think you... Yeah, go for Becky. Yeah, I'm ready. Up, up, up, up. - Okay. - One. Yeah, yeah. Down, down, down. Up, up, up, up. Seize the day. What?! Also, thank you for the birthday card, guys. What's her problem? Ow! Zooey. Zooey, get your butt in the seat. One, two... Thank you. Would you like your juice? No. It's apple juice, honey. It's your favorite. I don't like it. Oh. Well, yesterday, you really liked apple juice. All right, well, I think it's nap time when we get home with the way you're acting. - Nope. I'm going somewhere else. - Where might you be going? Richard, are you home? Sofia? Hey. I have kind of a funny story. I quit my job today. Wanted me to sign my own birthday card. Richard. Honey, are you okay? Hey. Hey, baby. You go back to bed? No, I was, uh... I was just... No, that's not... What's going on? Also, why are there two sandwiches out here? Oh, I... I, uh, didn't... I didn't know what I wanted, so I just... I got... two. Is that a puppy in there? That better be a puppy, Richard. Hi. Were you gonna jump out of that? 'Cause I would love to see you try. - I probably shouldn't. - Yeah. Babe, I... Uh... Um, I'll be back in an hour. Tell your girlfriend to go home and don't be here when I get back. Oh my God. Damn it! Damn it! God. Oh my God, Sofia, are you okay? Do not! Do not come down here! I was just gonna come down and help you. You've got one hour, dick! Okay. - Go! - Okay. Oh, this is not my day. It is not my day. You know what my favorite time of day is? When I get to say good morning to you. Good morning, Mother. Oh, honey. Good morning, my dear. How is my little baby bird today, hmm? - I'm still stuck in the nest. - Mm? You know what? I made you some breakfast. You got a big day ahead of you. No, I don't remember seeing anything on my schedule. You know, you've been in your little poop place long enough. And I want you to come to my Zumba class today. Mom, the doctor, I think, is gonna have something to say about me Zumba'ing. I told all the girls that you're in town, and they're just dying to meet you. - Mom. - Honey. No, no, no, no. Don't "Mom" me. You're going to go, honey. We gotta get you back up on your feet... Your foot. Your f... Your crutches. Come on, honey. You know what? Your new life is not going to find you under the covers. - Okay, okay. - We gotta grab it. - Okay. - They're gonna absolutely adore you. Five, six, seven, and over. There ya go! Two. I mean four. Six. Okay. And now it's touch time. When you feel ready, add the shoulders. Pat yourself on the back. That's it. You deserve it. If you get lost, follow Julietta. And now we're going to merengue! This is something like that. Keep your hands up high. Take 'em down low, low. Yeah, I know. So we'll see you next time, hmm? I work as a graphic designer in the city. Oh, my goodness. Who do you do that for? That's a... That's a good question. I... She's between jobs so she can spend time with her lonely mother in Sonoma. - How long are you staying? - Uh, I don't know. I... Probably until I can put some weight on this ankle, 'cause it's just kind of hard to get around the city in crutches. Yeah. I'm gonna have her dancing Zumba next to you, Julietta, before you know it. Well, if anyone can put a little salsa in your butt, it's her. Mm, a girl can dream, right? - Oh! She is such a cute darling. - I know. Thank you. Well, I gotta go shower off before Alejandro gets home. He and I have this little post-Zumba ritual. It's the only way I can get rid of the extra energy. That's my girl. Bye. Oh my gosh. She and Alejandro have sex. I got that. Well, you survived. Yeah. Your old guys and gals really got it goin' on. Thank you for that view into my very, very near future. Oh, stop. Oh, look. - What? - It's a... a cooking class. "Learn Spanish summer dishes at El Corazon." - Oh, I love that place. - Mm-hmm. - You should sign up. - No, I'm good. - But why? Why not? - 'Cause I know how to cook. What? What do you make? I make anything. I make chicken, steak, fish, rice... - That... No, that... - Noodles, potatoes. I... That's not cooking, that's just heating things up. - Yeah, that's cooking. - No, no. Cooking's more creative. It's... It's... Okay. How do you prepare your chicken? - How do I prepare my chicken? - Mm-hmm. I warn it that the pan is going to be very hot. And then I drop it in. I'm signing you up. Mom, that's a couples cooking class. - Do I look like I'm in a couple right now? - Well, I can be your couple. I can't think of anything more tragic than what you just said. Oh, don't be silly. Mom, seriously, the idea of being in a couple literally gives me hives. I don't want to be in a kitchen staring at a bunch of lovebirds making tapas and googly eyes at each other. - So, please. Come on, just do it for me. - No, Mom. Don't sign me up. - I'm serious. - Okay. Good morning, Mother. Good morning, my dear. Come on. Wake up. We're going to have fun at the spa today. Okay. All right. We're here. Oh, this isn't the spa. Oh. Oh God, I forgot. Spa's tomorrow. Okay, then what are we... Mom... I said no. Oh, come on, honey, please. I specifically said no. Just, you know what? Just one class. If you don't like it, I swear we'll never come back. Do you see what I'm wearing right now? This is child abuse. You're 30. Then it's grown human abuse. You know, you're being so dramatic. It's just one stupid class. Mom. I'm not going in. Oh, Sofia. This is stupid. You take the class by yourself, see how you like it. Okay. Okay, let's go. No, you go. I'm going to wait here. It's a couples class. I need my couple. Mom, I'm not going. No. - Honey, come on. Get your butt out. - I... - No, you get your butt... Don't! Mom! - Get... - Stop pulling me! - Don't talk like that. - You're gonna break my other ankle. - No. - Get your butt out of the car. - Mom, stop! Excuse me, excuse me. Do you, uh... Did you need some help? Oh my God. Uh, you know what? I think we might. I can't seem to get my daughter out of the car. - And she's got a bad ankle. - It's... Mom! Okay. Oh, okay, uh, here let me try. It's okay. - No, I can do it myself. Look. - No, no. - I'm just being... - This'll... This will be easier. Um, just put your arm around my neck. - Okay. - Okay? Okay. And now, ready? - We'll just... There you go. - Aw. And we're just gonna hop up nice and easy. - Okay. - There you go, there you go. There we go. Uh, and these, uh... - These are yours, no? - How did you guess? - Oh, thank you so much. - Yes, of course. I just couldn't... couldn't get her out of there. I don't know why the car was giving her such trouble. Anyway, I think we've got it now, so... Okay. Glad I could help. - Yup. Thank you. Thank you so much. - Yeah. - Sorry, sorry. - No, it's okay. Sorry, sorry. Thanks again. Thank you. - Mom, I don't know where to go. - Okay. We're gonna go this way. Come on. Hi. Hello, welcome to El Corazon. Uh, how can I help you? Oh, are you here for the class? - For the cooking class, yes. - Oh. Uh, you... you do know it's for... for couples? Okay... - Yeah, yeah. - Mm. Um... No better couple than mother-daughter. Okay. Of course! Yes, please join them inside. Oh, okay. Looks fun already. Come on. Hi, sorry. And yes, I see we have our final couple. Venga, venga. - This is your spot right here. - Thank you. - You must be, uh, Lainie and Sofia, yes? - Mm-hmm. Which is which? - I'm Lainie. This is my daughter, Sofia. - I'm just gonna... Hi. Ah! Que monada. So wonderful. Yes. - Oh, I got this. It's okay. Thank you. - You sure? Are you gonna be okay with that, uh, chair, my dear? - Yeah. Is it okay that I sit? - Oh, no, no, no. That's fine. You put these on and we begin, yes? Let us start with the quick hellos of the couples. Um, you go first. Yes? Okay, I'm Kerala. - This is my husband, Frank. - Hi. We run the, um, bed-and-breakfast up on West view. Oh. And we just thought we'd find something to get our butts out of the house, right? That's about right. Of course. Perfect. And, uh, you next. Hi, I'm Todd. Uh, hi, I'm, uh, David. Um, we own the Sonoma Creamery. - Ooh, I love your cheeses. - Yeah. Oh, thank you. We cheese to please. - Todd, please. No. - Okay. So... Uh, we do a lot of cooking together, and we wanted to learn, uh, new Spanish dishes. Mm. So here we are. Olé! So wonderful. And, uh, you? Uh, we're Chad and Brittany. We met online. Hi, everyone. And we thought, what's more romantic... ...than taking a cooking class together? Maybe get to know each other a little better. Cooking can be very romantic and intimate. Yes. And so can eating. Okay, you two ladies. Oh, um, we're not dating. No. - Surprise. - No. We're... We're, um, Lainie and Sofia, the mother-daughter couple. And, uh, normally Sofia lives in San Francisco, but she's going through a little life change. Yeah? And, uh, so she's staying here in Sonoma with me now. And right at this moment, I wish I was dead. - What? Aw. - Oh! No dying here, please. Only cooking. Well, we have lots to do so, um... As you know, uh, I am Guillermo and I am a couple, too. My wife, she is busy today, but I am joined by my nephew who is here from Spain for the month. Uh, where is Matias? Matias? Tío, Tío. Sorry, uh... Sorry, Tío, I had to get something from my car. Matias... Oh, I'm sorry. - Isn't he... - Mm-hmm. Matias has studied with some of the finest chefs in all of Europe. But now he gets to learn from the best. His tío Guillermo. Nice to meet you all, um, officially. Hi. So, we will be making delicious dishes for the summer leading all the way up to La Noche de San Juan. This is the celebration of the summer solstice, the longest day of the year. This is when, um, friends and loved ones, they gather on the beaches of Spain with big fires to welcome the arrival of summer. - Oh, how lovely. - That's lovely. Oh! Jinx! And, uh, today we will start with, uh, one of the most popular dishes in Spain, the tortilla Española. What you call the Spanish omelet. - Ooh! - Ah? Oh. - Egg. - Ah, huevos. - Muy bien. - Thank you, huevos. - So fun, so fun. - Oh, yeah, eggs. Cut your potatoes into quarters and then you slice them into little triangles. Watch your fingers, honey. You watch yourself while I'm holding this knife. Oh. They should be about this thick for the best taste. How's Sofia doing? Yeah, those look, uh, very good actually. Uh, lucky you do not need to use your foot for this, huh? He's so cute. And then you sprinkle a little truffle salt on your potatoes once they are cut. Kerala, those look wonderful. - Thanks, Guillermo. - I... I put the salt on. Oh! Well... Hey, cut it out. That's a no-no. - Oh! - No. It's not gonna last. Keep on beating them until they are good and mixed. Take out all of your frustrations out on those eggs, huh? This is gonna be a killer omelet. Oh. You seem very, uh, angry at those eggs. Yeah, I've got, like, a lot of frustration to take out. So, just... - Okay. - Yeah. Seems healthy. Safe. Yeah. - What? Stop. - What? What? - Focus on your potatoes. - Very mediocre. Good job. Now, this is the fun part. You will take your tortilla flipper, or a plate or a lid if you are not from Spain and do not have a tortilla flipper, and you will cover the pan. Mm? And then you will flip your tortilla quickly, like so. Eh? Oh, just like that, huh? - Oh, you can do this! I promise. - All right, all right. Yes! Okay. - And then... - Yeah! - That's not terrible. - Oh! - I'm a chef! - Right? We made it. Now what? Now what? Uh, you just put it back in the pan and, uh, you cook the other side. - Slide it? - Yeah, slide it. Oh, a little of that. Yes! - Okay. Oh, we got a runner! - Oh, shoot! - Sorry, sorry. Get right there. - It's okay. See, look. No, no. Oh, it's okay. There. No worries. - So exciting. - There, good as new, okay? - Okay, okay. We can take it from here. - Okay. Of course. - Thank you. - Thanks. Make sure it's nice and round. Matias, is this... is this a problem? That can be saved. - Oh, yay. Okay. - Oh, good. Be nice. I am being nice. You be less nice. How about that? Double flip. And now for the best part. We get to eat what we have made. And you can put a little, uh, salt and pepper on it, if you like. - Okay. Looks great. - Bit of salt. I like more truffle salt. Oh my God. Oh my God, this is fantastic. Guillermo, I love it. So wonderful. Uh, this is the perfect dish for any tapas party, and you should not have one without it. That's true, that's true. Oh, God, well, I... I love it. It's not not good. "Not not good." Ooh, and the onions... - It's actually... - Truffle salt. - It's the truffle salt. - Okay, I'm good after this. That was fun. I know I had a really good time. - We'll see you all next week, yes? Yes. - Oh, you can count on it! - Thank you. - That was fun. Bye! - Oh, bye. Nice meeting you. - Good night. - This was better. - Uh, thank you. - Okay. - Bye. Bye, see you. - Bye. Thank you, man. - No, look. When you cook at home, you clean up. But when you cook here, we clean up. Right, Tío? Que claro. - Oh, I love the sound of that. - Yeah, you do. - Yes. - Ah. - Oh, I can... - Here. No, but would you be needing help, uh, to your... to your car? No, my mom and I have got it. Thanks. Yeah. I'll be outside. I... Uh, let me help. This... here. - No, no, no, I... I can grab... - No, it's okay. I can help, it's okay. No, it's nothing. Don't worry, no trouble. - Thank you. - Hey, de nada. Yeah. - Then let... I can carry. - I can grab it. It's okay. It's... Please. Oh. Thanks. So did you enjoy the class? - Honestly, not really, no. - Why not? 'Cause I just spent an hour making eggs and potatoes. Yeah, but that is just the basics. It's... It's the personal touches, the flavor, that make it, um, special. - Mm. - You know, like my uncle's truffle salt. Which, between you and me, is always the secret ingredient. Well, between you and me, it's a pretty simple dish. Yeah, well, many of the old recipes began with the simplest of ingredients because it was all that people could afford at the time. It's not exactly fine dining, is it? N... No. No, it's... it's traditional dining, which is, uh, in many ways, harder than having everything you want to make a dish. I don't know, I think IHOP kind of crushes it with the Rooty Tooty Fresh 'n Fruity breakfast. Is that fine dining? No, but it gets the job done. Yeah, of c... Eating is not a job. Eating is one of life's greatest pleasures, you know? Yeah, sometimes it's life's only pleasure. What... What... What does that mean? I think I hear my mom calling me. - Really? - Yeah. - Do you wanna follow me to the car? - Yes, of course. - Or should I hobble with the box in hand? - No, no, I will help you. So, uh, you will be back next week though, yes? - Oh, yes. Oh, we'll be back. - I... - Okay, okay. - You can count on that. I guess we will. Uh, just, um, promise me, between now and then, no, uh, Rooty Tooty-whatever. - No more Rooty Tooty? - Yeah. It's gonna be hard, but I'll try. - Uh... - Thank you. Great job. Hasta la próxima, Lainie. Hasta to you, too. - Thank you. - Oh, I can... I can help you if you need. - I... Oh, okay. - Yeah. - Here, let me. - I... Thank you. Yup. Careful. Okay. - Okay, uh, you can just shut the door. - Okay. Sí. Yup. - Hasta luego. - Okay. What? Did you make a friend? I walked two students to their car. I was being polite. Incredible. You've only been here a few days and you already captured the heart of an American girl. That's not the message I was getting. - Trust me. - You know I'm dating Irina. Oh! Irina. Yeah, she's dating you. - And half of Europe. - You don't know that. Anyone with an Instagram account knows that. Go out with the American girl. She's cutie. I have a job to do. You do yours. Papa! Matias was born with no huevos. Viviana, leave your cousin alone. He is alone. That's the point. He seemed nice, huh? Mm. Seemed Spanish. What's wrong with that? Spanish men are players, Mom. Everybody knows that. No, I didn't get... I didn't get a player vibe. Mm-hmm, and that's because Spanish men are charmers with their... accents and their big smiles. Well, I like big smiles, so... Hey, let's go... let's go back to the restaurant and have dinner tonight, just see if he's working. Mm. Yeah, okay, so you want to stalk him. No... No, he's... He's new in town. - He might need a friend to hang with. - So go hang with him, Mom. You need to get out of the house, honey. I am. I'm gonna go have dinner with Olivia on Friday. Oh, well, why didn't you tell me? I have to tell you when I make plans? Okay, yeah. That's just... That's really rich because you made plans for us to go to a cooking class today and nobody told me about it. Honey, I just was happy to hear that you're feeling better, that's all. Mom, I'm not some sort of basket case. Well... You were a bit of a basket case. - Mom. - You... And now that's over and yay. - Yay. - Yay. Okay. How much longer do you need those? Um, I find out later this week if I can start putting weight on it. And that is one last gift from Richard. God. I would like to break both of that boy's legs. You're welcome to, you have my permission. Honey, why were you with him for so long? I don't know. He was there and he was safe, and we could hang our prom photo up in the living room. - Mm, barf. - I know. I was just scared of moving to San Francisco. It was just easier to do it with him. The wedding vows just write themselves, huh? Shut up. I know. Anyway, how are you and your little family? - Um, Dennis has been good. - Yeah? Yeah, he, uh, actually just got a small promotion. - Really? That's amazing. - Yeah. - And Ella won't stop being a chatterbox. - Oh! What is she saying? Gum and teeth, gum and teeth. Oh, okay. This... She's an intelligent one. She get it from her mama. Yes, she does. You know, Dennis has actually been really good with Ella. Surprising. Yeah. God, you're so lucky. He's... He's honestly one of the only good ones left. None of them are good ones, Sof. You have to train them all and retrain them. - Oh, right. Retrain them. Yes. - And then retrain them and retrain... Hi, ladies. Uh, what can I get you? - Um, we'll have a volcano bowl to start. - Yeah. Do you know what you wanna eat? Do you have omelets? No, sorry. - Seriously? - Just asking. Chicken fingers for me, please. Me, too. Good choice. I'll be right back with your drink. Thank you. You want an omelet at a bar? No, not really. I... I just can't stop thinking about this cooking class that I'm taking with my mom. Um, we made Spanish omelets this week. - You took a class to make an omelet? - I did. Yes. Okay, uh, let me guess. You put eggs in a pan. - Mm-mm. Mm-mm. - You put stuff in it and you cook it. No! That's why it's funny. - What? - This was different. It was different. This was super, super simple, but... special somehow. And so now you can't stop thinking about omelets. Yeah, something like that. I need that, uh, paella, Matias. It's coming, coming. So? Wonderful? So wonderful. Thank you. - What's next? - Uh, well, we can finish up, Matias. - Why don't you call it a night, eh? - No. Are... Are you sure? I'm still good. No, no, no. There's only a few tables left. You did good work tonight. Uh... Hey, miss. Ew. I will be so happy when going to the bathroom is not a full-body workout. I bet. - All right, where we going next? - Ugh, I can't, I have to go home. What? I finally get a night out with you and calling it quits? Girl, Ella wakes up at the crack of dawn whether I am hungover or not. I prefer not. God, she's... She's so needy. Uh, excuse me. I'll be right with you. I saw some really cute guys in there. You know what? Maybe that's what you need, is to find yourself a new man. Oh, God! That is the last thing that I need. Men suck and they betray you every chance they get. Oh, that's my car. Uh, you good? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good. Mine's, like, a couple minutes away. Okay. You know, boys suck. I'm talking about finding you a real man, okay? That's our top priority next time we hang out. Okay. Let me get through the summer without getting completely heartbroken again, and then we'll re-evaluate that whole situation. You gotta give me a minute, man. Love you, be safe. Bye. Tell Ella I say hi. You got it. - Sofia? - Yeah. Matias. Hi. I did not see you there. Oh, I just... I just, um, stopped in to... to get a drink. Yeah. How was it? I don't know. I couldn't get the bartender's attention. Okay, so what? You just... gave up? I guess I did. Okay. I think I'm going to have to teach you to be, like, a little more rude if you're going to survive in America. So, tell me, how was, uh, Ducey's Tavern for dinner? It was good. They have the best chicken fingers. Chickens do not have fingers. I'm sorry, are you telling me that Spaniards don't have chicken fingers? Okay, so then tell me what, um... What spices do you put on these chicken fingers? Uh, whatever's in the ranch dressing. Your chickens have fingers and now they're getting dressed on the ranch, right? So now I have heard it all. This is America, we're full of surprises. My ride's here. Um... So, when will I learn how to order a drink in, uh, America? I should probably get home. Yeah. Yeah, of course, of course. But I will see you in class, yes? Yeah. Yeah. Um, oh, good. Okay. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Sorry. No, no, after you. Go. I'm sorry. - Thank you. - De nada, querida. Wait, what does that mean? Um, de nada is thank... "You are welcome," um, "my dear." Of course. Buenas noches, Sofia. Buenas noches, my dear. Sorry! Bye. - Hi, are you Sofia? - That's me. Any luck? No, there's... there's seriously not a lot out there, and... I'm realizing that leaving my job right after all the design graduates hit the workforce was not the greatest idea. Aw. What is that? Might have to consider getting my master's degree. Oh, that's... that's a commitment. Yeah, I don't know if I have a future without it. Is that a good school? Yeah. It's close. So that's good, right? Well, you know I love having you around. Yeah. Ugh. Well, at least when she dates other men, you get to see it happen. Those pictures are from her work. They don't mean anything. Oh. So, where does she work? A kissing booth? Go away. Matias, you're stuck. You need to release that fish to catch the prize. She is not a fish. No. No, no, no, no. She's a shark. - Get out of the water! - Oh my God. Leave me alone! ...John's wort. Hey, Mom, can I borrow the iron? - Oh, I'll do that for you, honey. Here. - Oh, thanks. Oh! - Ooh... Ooh... - Are you okay? - What's wrong? - I have... these stomach cramps. Oh, Mom, sit down. I can iron a dress. Oh God. - You okay? - Oh. Yeah. - Okay. - Oh my gosh. Oh gosh, honey, I don't... I don't think I can go with you to the class. Mom. No, I'm not going alone to the couples class. - We paid for it and somebody should go. - Mom. Forget it. No. We're gonna survive not knowing how to make pancakes. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. We have truffle salt. Yeah. You know, I'm thinking what if you just went... just went for a little bit of the class, stayed for... I'm gonna go. What? Yeah, I'm gonna go. Wait... You're gonna... You're gonna go? Yes, ma'am. So we made the tortilla Española for our, uh, bed and breakfast guests. - You made it. Mostly. - I... Okay, good point. I totally made it. They loved it. - Hi, everyone. - Hi! Hi. Where's your mom? Oh! Uh, she does not feel very well. So she encouraged me to hobble here without her. No crutches? No, thank God. Apparently the bone is mostly healed now. So, it's exciting stuff. Yeah. Okay, my good people. Let's settle in, eh? Uh, I see we are short one chef today. Yeah, sorry. She doesn't feel very well. Oh, well, that's good. I mean, it's not good, but este... Matias. Matias will be your partner for today's class. Are you sure he can keep up? Just kidding. Just kidding, Matias. He's coming along quickly this one, I... I'm sure he'll be just fine. Oh, thank you, Tío. Thank you. Okay, today, we are going to make gazpacho. Mm! Nice. It is the perfect dish for the summer 'cause when it is hot and... and everybody's sweaty, and you give them a little gazpacho, and everyone is much happier. Eh? The secret to gazpacho is ripe tomatoes. - Honey, the... Your fingers. - Yes. - I'm doing the knuckle thing. - Yikes! Do not lose the juicy seeds. They give depth to the flavor. - How am I... - What? How am I not supposed to lose the juicy seeds? - Quick, quick cuts, clean and fast. - Not... Okay. Be careful. Okay? - Yeah, that's perfect. Perfect. Good. - This is so much work. That's... Why do you think this is work? It's not. Look, it's a... it's a joy to cook. I... No, I don't... I don't think I have the cooking gene. It's just not in there. - What is this gene? - I'm not born to do this. We are not born to do anything. We're just born to lie there and cry, and we learn everything we do. And you can learn this. Look, you're learning it. - Wow. - What? I've just realized why I'm so good at lying around and crying. I... I've been doing it my entire life. Oh. - Yes. Okay. - I'm a professional lier around and crier. Okay, now you're going to be a professional tomato cutter. You need a good coating of olive oil to give your dish a creamy flavor. And then, sherry vinegar from the hills of Spain. It's a strong complement to the flavors of your ingredients. And remember, no balsamic vinegar ever in gazpacho, eh? Do you smell that? Now, we will mix the ingredients. We will get our hands dirty. - Do you want to dive in first? - No, no. You are the one with frustrations to get out, no? - Yeah. No, I was just asking. - Go on, you try it. Go, go. All right. - Ew. - Go. Go, go! But get in. Get in, get in. Eh? Ah. Keep going. Squeeze. Uh-huh. Now, pat down. Now, pat down. Pat down. Get it out, get it out. - Keep squeezing? - Then I turn. Yeah. Keep... You were very angry the other day. Now, you must let the juices marinate for at least an hour, but overnight is better. Yes. So all that is left now is we blend the soup and we are done. And when do we cook it? Oh, no, no, no! No, we do not cook gazpacho. - Oh. - No. No. - It is done when it is the consistency... - Sure. ...of how you would like to eat it. I'm a chunky monkey myself. I'm taking the class for a reason, I guess. That goes to the side. Twist. - Do you want to press the button? - Yeah. Mm? Mm, mm. That's so good. We did that. Thank you for being my partner today. It was my pleasure. My mom's actually gonna love this. You should give that to her with some summer sangria. Absolutely not. No. Why not? Boxed wine, apple slices, and 7 Up? - Mm, that... No, no. That is not sangria. - I'm gonna pass on giving that to her. - That's definitely sangria. - Okay. No, no, no. - You're gonna sit and you're gonna try. - Like right now? Yes, yes! Right now is always the best time for sangria. Go, come on. Come on. - Okay. - Please, sit. Okay? Oh, okay. - Okay. Okay, now wait. - I'll get your menus. Okay. Is this a chicken finger? - Mm. No. - You sure? No, that is a croqueta for you to try with your sangria. - Okay. - Okay? So, look, look, look. The fruits have been marinated in brandy and sugar. Okay? And then combined with a Spanish Rueda, and now you top it with a nice crisp dry Cava. - Mm. - Okay? - Okay? - Great. Yeah. Yeah. Please don't tell me you're going to stand the whole time. - Oh, no. - 'Cause that's... - No, no, no. I sit, I sit. - Okay. Okay, so go. - Now you try a bite of your croqueta. - Okay. Uh-huh. A-ha. And now a sip of the sangria. - Salud. Salud. - Salud. Yeah, that's, uh... that's really delicious. - You see? - Yeah. You see, when food is done in just, um, the right way, it can be the most, um, sensual experience that there is. - Sensual? - Uh-huh. Yes, it's like licking whipped cream off of boobies. Um... That is sexual. - Oh! - No, no. - Okay, sorry. - What I mean is sensual. In the sense that all five of your senses are... are triggered. The look and the smell... ...of the food. The taste... of course. And... the way it feels... in your mouth. Actually, no, that's... that's not all five senses, 'cause I can't hear the food. No, not the food itself, but the sounds of joy and laughter and "Mm!" - Okay. - Should be a part of every meal. - I can feel the joy. - And that is how you trigger the ears. Salud. Ah, salud. Yes, yes. Salud. So, um, what is it that you do, Sofia? Me? Um... Sorry. I'm a graphic designer. What is this? Um... Okay, like, see this label here. Um, someone has to decide, "Oh, I'm gonna put a señorita on there." "And I'm going to give her a basket, put a flowery hat on her head," and make her super happy "as though collecting fruit is the coolest job in the world." That's a graphic designer's job. So, it is like cooking. - No, it's not at all like cooking. - Of course it is. Look, you... you take all the ingredients and you put them together, and then all the flavors make a final dish. No. Because in design, there's no recipe to follow. Mm. And where do you think recipes come from? From the stars? No, okay? People have put together all the flavors over many years. Making many works of art. And you are a chef of pictures. Okay. Well, you make it sound, like, way more romantic than it actually is. It's actually, like, really hard work sometimes. And do you think of many things as work? Yeah. When it's my job, I do. But does it not bring you, um, happiness to design these pictures? Yeah, of course it does. It's just... My entire life has been me trying to, like, prove myself in one way or another, 'cause people look at me and they judge me because I'm a woman or because I'm young or because... 'Cause you are beautiful. Uh... Thank you, um... - Because of how I look, I would say. Yeah. - Mm-hmm. But your pictures, they... they speak for themselves, no? Not always, no. What would you, um... What would you design for me? - For you? - Yes, for my restaurant. - Oh, do you have a restaurant? - Oh, no. No, no. I'm still learning. But, uh, my dream is to one day become a master chef and have my own restaurant. Okay, um... Well, I'd have to get to know you. - Like, a lot better. - Mm-hmm. I'd have to know what kind of food you're serving at your restaurant, what kind of atmosphere you want to create. - Um, you know, all that stuff. - Mm. Hmm, yeah, that does sound like a lot of work. No, I don't think that would be work. I think... I think that'd be quite fun. Okay. Papa! - Matias is giving away the best Cava. - Hey. Oh my God. - Por favor, Viviana. - He must really like you. - Save me some. - Okay. Ah, you leave them alone. This is my star student. Salud, Sofia. Uh, de nada, querida. Sorry. So is there, um, anything else I need to know about you? Do you have a girlfriend back in Spain or... Oh, is this going to be part of the logo? - Just doing my research. - Ah. You know what? I have a better idea. Uh, Tío, Tío, I... I think that your, um, star student needs some extra schoolwork. Sorry, I... I what? Mom, I'm home. In here, honey. Hope you're feeling better because we've got some gazpacho to finish... eating. Hi. Hi. I, uh, never gave you your birthday present. I forgot how nice it is here. Good times. Mm-hmm. Your mom seems... seems good. You know, my... My... My parents actually, they turned my room into a yoga studio now. - Mm. - So, yeah. And Kristie, she's graduating high school... Can you just say what you came here to say, please? Okay, I'm... I'm... I'm really sorry for what I did to you. And us. You know, it was selfish and I just wish I could take everything back. It didn't mean anything. - It obviously meant something. - No. I don't even know that girl. I will literally never see her again. No, I'm saying it meant something about us. It meant that something was very, very wrong with us, and you couldn't talk to me about it. That's not true. I was being stupid. Okay. So, what? You want me to just forgive you? I just want you to know that I realize that I made a really big mistake. And I truly am sorry. Of course. What, honey? It's pretty. I don't wear necklaces. Ever. He doesn't even know that. Shut up! He thinks you're gonna forgive him? - He seemed pretty sincere. - No. Sofia, when someone shows you who they are, believe them. Everybody makes mistakes, Livy. Meanwhile, you've got Antonio Batatas. He's literally wining and dining you. No, he's just being nice. There's nothing going on there. I don't know, doesn't sound like it to me. No, he's Spanish. It's in his genetic code to flirt. Girl, he is fine, okay? You gotta find out. No. He's going back to Spain in a few weeks anyways. So? You're not trying to find true love. You're trying to avoid falling back in with true evil. Yeah. Right? True evil. Here you go. Liv, I'm tired. I'm tired of making these big decisions. What big decisions? Like quitting my job and moving out of my place with Richard. - Those are big decisions. - Wait, wait. You didn't quit your job. - Did you? - Ish. Oh. Quit-ish. Yeah, just like you dumped-ish Richard after he cheated on you? Ish. Sofia, honey, you didn't make those decisions. They were made for you. Now, you keep letting yourself stay in these horrible situations and then you lose a piece of yourself. And if you get back with Richard, he's going to be making that decision for you too. Because that's what he wants. Okay. Mm? Hmm. Oh, God. Hello. - Oh! Hola, Sofia. - Hi. Oh, wow. Your dress is so pretty. - I love it. - Thank you, thank you. Um, is Matias here? Oh, he got into a little bit of trouble. What happened? Well, he's been distracted the last couple of nights, and I think I know why. Mm! No idea. - He messed up one of the dinners. - Oh, okay. So, what now? Is he fired or... You cannot fire family. You can only torture them. - Oh. - So, he's on lunch shift today. Oh, okay. That doesn't sound that bad. That scared me for a second. Oh, but I do not think that is the end of Papa's torture. Sofia. - Hi. - Buenos dias. Uh, are... are you here to eat? No, uh, I was gonna see if you wanted me to show you around, maybe. Um... Later, I can show you how to get that drink. - I would love that. Um... - I mean, if... if you're free. Papa! Uh, Matias is done for the day. - Ah, my star student. - Hello. You put my boy's head back on straight for me, yes? Yes. I will try. Boy's hopeless. Sit outside. I'll be right there. - Okay, thank you. - Okay. Take this off. Take... Give it here. One crema Catalana, compliments of our visiting chef. Mm. You made this? I made a batch earlier. - Yes. - It's delicious. Yes, he does do some things well. - Aw. - Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you, Viviana. This looks like crème brûlée. No, except this not like crème brûlée, crème brûlée is like it. Meaning what? That we did it first and the French stole our recipes. - Oh. - Yeah. Eh, ta... taste. Oh my God, that is, oh, so delicioso. Uh, I also made something for you. It's just a prototype. Oh, this looks, uh... very pro. I was just, like, messing around with some designs. I love it. Is... Is that me? It's a version of you, yeah. I will have to grow more mustache for this restaurant. No, no, we can shave him as well, if you want to. No, no, no. I will... I will grow it, I will grow it. So, where is... where is your logo? - Mine? - Yeah, your logo for Sofia's Designs. I don't have one. Oh, so you are like the cobbler with no shoes. Sadly, yeah. You are very sweet. So are you. But you have to be sweet to yourself too, no? Yeah. You're right. So have you, um, ever been to, uh... to Spain? No, it's really embarrassing. I've... I've, like, barely left California. But you went to university, no? In San Jose, yeah. In Costa Rica? Santa Clara. - Is that far? - No. Not at all. Uh, well, there's no... there's no greater, um, collection of art in the world than in Madrid, you know. There's, um, the Prado. There's the... the Reina Sofia. There's even an... an American museum. Wow, is that just, like, a bunch of paintings of cowboys and Mountain Dew? No. No, not this America. Um, um, South America. Oh, okay. I think... I think I've heard of that. Uh-huh. And then, my city, we have El Museu Picasso. You have heard of Picasso, right? Yeah, it, like, slightly rings a bell. Uh-huh. - What city is this? - Barcelona. - Sorry, what? - Barcelona. - Why do you have a lisp all of a sudden? - No, it's... It is called distinción, and, um, it's because, in... in, uh, Spain, it's different than in Latin America. No, so... so, in Latin America, you say "gracias" - and in Spain we say... - ..."gracias." Okay, I thee. Oh! Hurts the brain. - Sorry, I shouldn't have done that. - No, I... I, uh... I liked it. I liked it a lot. Um... It's just... back home... You have a girlfriend. No, no. I have somebody that I thought I wanted as a girlfriend. Eh, she is not, um... She's not so sweet. Well, then you've got to be sweet to yourself, no? Yeah. - Come on. - Where are we going? Come on. Come with me. Oh! Oh. Early morning? Late night. Oh, you want some tea? Yes, please. You seem to be feeling better. - Yeah, I am. - Oh. So, um... Were you making some gazpacho? Yeah. Yeah, you could say that. Honey! Guillermo is a married man. What did I do? Why didn't you tell me? I thought you knew. Oh, honey. You deserve to have some fun after everything you've been through, so... Yeah, beats crying every night. - Yeah. - Mm. Just don't know what I'm supposed to tell Richard now. You don't have to tell Richard anything. Well, he still wants us to be together. What about Matias? What about him? He goes back to Spain in ten days. Well, do you like the way he makes you feel? A lot, yeah. Well, Matias doesn't have to be your escape hatch from Richard, honey, but he can certainly help you realize that you're gonna have to create your own escape hatch. I think I know what you mean by that. I'm gonna go deliberate. - Yeah. Deep thoughts. - Thank you. - I hope so. - Yeah, seriously. - Buenos dias, Lainie. - Aw. Oh, Viviana, buenos dias. Oh, we missed you last week. - Hi. Good to see you. - Hola, Sofia. Good to see you. I did not think you would be here. - Oh, no, no, I'm fine now. - Yeah, she's all good. Not only because of that, because of him. Oh my God. What is with you just showing up at places? Sorry. I just... You know. Look, we're... we're having a party at the house for Kristie for her graduation, and she'd really like to see you. I'll see. Everyone would love to see you. I would love to see you, too. Richard, this isn't the time or place for this. I just wanna watch, you know, it looks fun. You're gonna have to ask if you can do that. - I did. They said it was no problem. - You did? Mm-hmm. - Great. - Okay. - Cool. - Cool. Vi, Vivi, is Matias here? Oh, he is. Still being tortured. - What does that mean? - Oh, you will see. Okay, all my lovely peoples. Let us settle in, yes? Yes. Today, I have a treat for you. We are going to make one of the most well-known Spanish dishes. Paella! Eh? But first, we must have a glass of rebujito. Uh, rebujito is a summer drink to take away the heat, and... it will be served by a traditional Spaniard, dressed in traditional festive wear. This is so fun! Matias. Oh! Oh boy! Ho-hoy! Wow! Oh my God! Matias is our jotero for today. He will entertain us with song and dance. Ta-da! I do not know any song or dance. Everyone knows a little. Whoo-hoo! - No. No! - Yes! - No, no, no. - Yes, yes, yes! Yeah! Okay! Matias? - Matias? - Hola, Irina. I am Viviana, Matias' cousin. Hello. Irina? Well, at least some people here have manners. Ahem. Hello. I did not know you were coming here. Well, that's what makes it a surprise, isn't it? It... Hi. Hi. Hi. Is this how you do cooking in America? No, this is, uh... This is for my, uh... A class that my uncle is... is having. Oh! For the silly little bunches of Americans. - Hello! - Uh, yeah. You must be exhausted from your travels, so we should let them do their class. - Come, come. Come on. - Dasvidaniya. Have good day. Irina out. Okay. Okay, peoples! La Noche de San Juan is still coming, yes? Back to the paella, yes? I'm gonna give you two a couple minutes, okay? - Hey. - Hi. I did not expect Irina to come here. Yeah, I figured that. Maybe she does care more about you than you thought. No. She just likes to be the center of attention. I think, uh, she was afraid that I could actually survive without her. Well, I didn't expect Richard to be here either. I thought maybe that was your Richard. He doesn't really know when to call it quits, but, um... ...but I do. Sofia, I don't want this to... I just really can't be the other woman for Irina. 'Cause my life's completely just been blown up by one. - And I can't do that to her. - No, no. She's... only here for, like, a couple of days and then she's flying somewhere. - I don't... - And then you leave right after that. Matias, this has been good. Really, really good. This has barely just yet begun, and... Gotta be sweet to myself. And to do that, I've got to keep my heart safe. Adios, Matias. Ouch. Ah, maybe it's time to step off, Matias. Sounds to me like she's starting to finally see you for who you really are. Yeah, and, uh... who am I? Come on, man, you don't really care about her. I get it. You're just trying to get laid while you're in America, and then you're just going to take off when you're done. But you care about Sofia? Yeah, I've been with her since high school. On and off. We moved in together, so... And you cheated on her. That was a mistake. She knows she's still mine. Doesn't sound to me like she's anyone's. Not mine. - And certainly not yours. - Well, you don't know her. I do. That's good. Then you know she doesn't like necklaces. Everyone likes necklaces, okay? Yeah. - Do you like this one or that one better? - I like this one. - Yeah? Should we color it in red? - Oh my. Is there red or orange in there? Jesus. - Yikes. - Yeah. Yo, she put the "super" in supermodel. I know, right? Maybe she has a eating disorder. Stop. That's not funny. - Okay. - Say, "Mom, you are in time out." I'm just saying. She's not perfect. She's just... pretty. Yeah, and she's here. Yeah, not the best timing. Nope. But hey, that's not on you. You put yourself out there and it paid off. Yeah, it paid off for one little night. - Just one. - So? That's a start. Yeah. Right? Toddler attack? Toddler attack! You're so yummy. Yum, yum, yum! I got you! She likes koalas. - Baby steps. - Aw! Huh? Sometimes you just gotta celebrate taking the baby steps. Oh... - Got it? - Yup. Oh, boy. This is nice. See? Now that's cooking. I mean, we are the class couple, now. Aw, where's Matias to clean up after us, though? I know. - Um, so I was wondering... - Mm? How would you feel if I applied to some schools that weren't in California? Oh, sure. No, I think you should. - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh yeah. You'd... You'd be okay? Yeah. What do you... What do you mean? Of course, honey. Don't be silly. Okay. It's just, we've never lived that far apart from each other before, so... Oh, honey, are you worried about, uh, me being okay, or you? Little bit of both, probably. Oh, sweetie, you know what? All I have ever wished was for you to go as big and as far as your wings would take you. I can take care of me. I promise. Okay. Mm. Gracias, Mama. De nada. Oh, that sounded very good. Did I? Was it close? - Yeah. - De nada. I don't know. You look so much happier, little angel. Oh, yeah, I'm definitely feeling better. Thanks. - Well, sometimes love will do that. - Huh? Julietta. What have you been saying about me, Mom? I can tell when there is love in the air. And Matias is a wonderful boy. You... You know Matias? He's my grandson. I'm gonna get... get my purse, and, uh... - Yeah. - You ready? Bye. - Let's stop on the way for dinner. - Mom. Stop right there. Matias is Julietta's grandson? How about that? How about that? "Oh, hey, let's take a cooking class." "Oh, hey, such a cute guy is teaching. Oh, hey, can't make it to class." Hey, you're making it sound sinister. I don't need my mom trying to fix my love life. - I wasn't, honey. - You were. - No, I wasn't. I wasn't! - Stop, you're so much. No, honey. I wa... I... Okay. Well, maybe I was. - Just... Just a little bit. Okay? - Yeah. I had a Matias, too. What? - Yeah. - When? Whe... Right about the same time that I met your father. His name was Henry, of all things. Your Matias was a Henry? Yes. And Henry and I fell... We fell madly in love and my parents did not approve. Why not? Henry wanted to travel the world. He wanted to seek adventure and live by the seat of his pants and... He... He just wasn't the kind of person that my parents pictured for me. So your father, he was a safe choice. God rest his soul. - And you chose safe. - Yeah. I did. And I often wonder what my life would have looked like if I'd followed my heart instead of my head. Huh. I had no idea. Yeah, well, you know, you're not supposed to have all the answers when you're 30. - But... You know? - Yeah. But life isn't something that you should just fall into. You've got to... You gotta jump in, both feet. Even if you don't know where you're gonna land. Yeah. Yeah. Well, for what it's worth, I am very, very happy that you chose safe. You are? Yeah, you wouldn't have had me if you didn't. Oh. Oh, no. No, honey. No, you were meant to be in my life and you would have found your way to me one way or another, that I am very sure. Okay, yeah. So tell me more about this Henry. And yes, you should make all of the different kinds of coca, but for La Noche de San Juan we have finished... - ...La coca de San Juan. - Ooh! Eh? You like that. Hey! Let us celebrate! - Yes. - Yes. I don't have any more room. - Gonna have to loosen... loosen the apron. - You'll make some. - Eh? - It's delicious! - Bueno? - It's delicious. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Gimme that one. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hey, hey. Um, where's Matias? Uh... Come with me. Uh, okay. Mom? - Hmm? - Mom, I'll be back. Okay. Honey. Go, go, go. - What? - We miss you. I missed you too, but you guys had Irina. Oh, Irina. She was a nightmare. All she wanted to do was be pampered and... God, I'm so sorry. You know. Well, she and Matias are no more. Really? He told her he was done being her puppy dog. Oh. How'd she take that? Well, have you seen a wild boar devour a small reptile? Not that specific combination, no. - I have. - Oh, no. He said that you helped him see how foolish he was to stay with her. Mm-hmm. I did that, huh? And I, for one, am so thankful that you did. Uh, hey, where is he? He, uh... He's leaving today for Barcelona. No, I thought he was staying through the weekend. He moved his flight up a few days because he wanted to get settled for the new job. Okay, okay. Um, do you think I can still catch him? - We can try. - Yeah? We need to try. Where? Uh, where? Okay! Let's check his apartment first, no? Yeah, his apartment. We can try and catch him at the airport. Vi, you really don't have to do this for me. It's okay. Of course I do. You're family. I love you. Okay, so I... I can drive. Okay, uh, I should let my mom know that... that we're... We need to hurry. Okay. Yeah. No, she'll be fine. I'll be fine. Uh, thank you. - Just... - Jeez! Uh, okay. Are you... Where are you gonna... - Go, go! Go find him. - Okay. All right. I'll come... I'll come find you. I'll look for you. I'll look for you. Thanks! - Ooh! I'm sorry. Sorry! - Scusi. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Sofia? Hi. Oh my God, you're still here. Oh. I thought you left. No, I... I, uh... I couldn't leave before trying chicken fingers. Chicken fingers. I like it. You know, I don't know how you do things in Spain, but here in America we actually say goodbye to people before we leave. Yes, um... I wanted to, but... you're a very... strong person. Wow, no one's ever accused me of that before. You knew what you wanted, so... I thought I should respect your wishes. Well, then, I guess this is a goodbye present. What is this? This is a Cabernet Sauvignon. It's the pride and joy of Sonoma County. - Yeah, I have heard of this. - Oh, yeah? I was... hoping that we could drink it together. To celebrate. To celebrate... what? I got accepted into a master's program for graphic design. I start in August. - Sofia, this... this is amazing! - Yeah. - Felicitaciones, mama. - Thank you, thank you. - I'm assuming that that means congrats? - Yes, yes. Oh, I'm getting so good at Spanish. Which, actually, will come in handy when I start school. Why is that? Because I'm going to be at the Institute of Design in Madrid. Wait. That's the... No, that... that... There's not one of those in Santa Clara or whatever, right? No, no. Just the one in España. That's amazing, mama. Mm, thank you. Perhaps, maybe you will let me come and, um, visit you sometimes while you are there. I think I'll have to sign up for every single one of Matias' tours... that Matias' Tours has available. I wish you didn't have to go. Uh... I can't... leave now. I have to try the pairing of chicken fingers and this wine. Come here. - No, it's... I have... It's an emergency. - Move the car, lady. No! No, no, no, no! This is an emergency. - I'm gonna move the car, they're... - I don't care. Get! Why are you being so mean? Hey. You found him! Did you miss your flight? Yeah, just barely. So happy. - Thank you, Vi. - "Vi"? Yes. Now I'm Vi. Yeah, we're, like, really close like that. Oh boy. We got him! No, I know, let's... I'm surprised you guys survived the car. Can you please open the trunk? - So, you can come. - Okay. - Help me move in. - Okay. - But... - But what? I get to decide what goes in the apartment. - Oh, yeah. Of course. - Okay. I thought you were... - I thought that would be more difficult. - No! No. - Buenas noches, ladies. - Wow. Hi. Come. Follow me. - Come on, Mama. - Okay. - You ready to have some fun? - Behave yourself. Here. Welcome, guys. Hello. Lainie and Sofia. My favorite cooking couple. The special guests have arrived. Ah! Welcome to la Noche de San Juan. Gracias. - No, no, no. - It's gracias. - Ah! - Oh! She's learning quick. Okay? - She is ready for Spain, querida. - I think so, I think so. - I think so. - Yeah. Well, come on in. I have some jamón. - Yes. Okay. - And I have some quesito manchego... - Oh, wow, I love manchego! - I think I know what that means. And we saved the gazpacho from... All right, I'm gonna grab an appetizer. I think it's fine. I think it's fine. I mean, I think it's time, Tío. - You think we should do it? - Yes. It is time now. All my lovely peoples, please pay attention. Yes! Now... we will write our wishes for the coming year, and we will... ...burn them in the fire. - That was terrifying. - Every single year. - Why is he saying it like that? - He does it every time. - It's his thing. - I hate that. And our couple of honor will jump over the fire. This will cleanse you of all your bad energy and give you a fresh start to the coming year. We? We have to jump over that? Oh yes. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, no. - No. - You can do it. - No, no, no. - I can't do that. My ankle just healed. - Yes, you can. - I can't do that. - It's okay, it's a little fire. - It's not even that big. Okay. - That's a huge fire! No. - Or... - You can use this. Okay, yeah. Very funny. I hate you guys. That terrified me. Okay, I guess I'm officially jumping in with both feet. - Right, Mom? - Give it, give it. Right. - I want that. I want that, too. - I don't know why I'm nervous. - Okay, um... - It's okay. - I guess so. - On three. One. Two. - Three. Come on! - Three. - Okay, Mom, now you. It's your turn. - No, I'm not gonna do that. - Yes, it's your first time. - I could get burned! Yes. Mom. You gotta use your Zumba muscles! - Mom, remember. - I can't... What? New beginnings. - Okay, new beginnings. - Come on. - Thank you. Ready? - All right. One... - Okay. - Two... Okay? Bonjour, ma chère. Oh my God. Is it Henry? Hi, Lainie. It's good to see you. I figured since I'm going to be so far away, you shouldn't be here alone. Love you, Mom. Oh my God, Henry. - I hope I'm not too late. - Oh! No such thing. You haven't changed. Oh, my God. To new beginnings. To happily ever afters.
