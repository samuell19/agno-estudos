Athi! -Dad! -Move! -Athi! -Dad! Heyâ¦ Athi! Dad! Actually, I don't trust you. You're talking about responsibility? -We haven't even spent an hour together. -You're a total failure as a father! Maybe that's why she chose Akash over you. And the way you're living, you'll be lonely someday. And you think room service will make things better? Why have you brought me here? Don't leave me here. Athi, I'm coming in three minutes! Athi, I'm coming in three minutes! Come on. Bhaisaab, I spared him because of you. Or I would've killed his dad! -He's insane! -Vicky, man! Calm down. He's a kid.

I don't think he loves you. In fact, I think he doesn't even care about you. Look, Iâ¦ I'm not a bad guy. I'm just a businessman who deals in cocaine. And your father has taken my cocaine worth 50 crore rupees. And he won't return it. I told himâ¦ give me my bag and take your son. But no! If I were your father, I would've gladly sacrificed this hotel for you! Do you know what he gave me in exchange for your life? Flourâ¦ Flour, buddy! Look! Do I look like a bloody pastry chef? No, right? You guys are wasting your time. If my dad has your drugs, you should forget about it. You're not gonna get it back. This kidâ¦ What the f*** is happening here?! Call Morris. What a cocky kid. Morris? Yeah, come inside. Look at me! I've worked really hard to build this 7-star hotel. You and your fatherâ¦ are putting me off-balance.

In kheema-form. You know what kheema is? Minced meat! Take him away, man. Give him his bloody lactose-free milk. Come on. Let's get you some lactose-free milk. Morrisâ¦ Find that bastard! Now! Yes, boss. Why are you still here? I had asked you to leave, right? I won't leave till I get him, sir! Aditi, I know that man, alright? He's a shrewd man! He must've duped us already and gotten away. He must've duped us already and gotten away. No, sir. The dope in that bag is worth 50 crore rupees. He won't leave without it. You know what? Just go home! This is an order. Police! -Have you seen anyone in a dark gray suit? -No. He just came in! No, ma'am. Shitâ¦ -Have you seen anyone? -No, ma'am. -Have you seen him? -No, ma'am. No one came here! I swear! Sumair, what the hell are you doing?! Where's my bag, Aditi? Back off, Sumair! I know you're working for Sikandar! You're the rat in the department. I don't have the time for this, Aditi! Where's my bag?! I know the truth about you! There's no coming back from here. I know who you are-- I've been working undercover for the past two yearsâ¦ to bust this drug racket and you f***ed it up for me! Where's the bag? The shootout at CP this morning, I had set it up! I asked Jaggi to accompany me because he's been f***ing dirty for years! Look at me! He's working for a senior cop! And that's the guy I need to get, you understand? You understand?! F***ing liar!

Exactly where you had kept it. I can't believe you don't trust me. I can't believe you don't trust me. You have no ideaâ¦ that the roots of the corruption in this department go all the way up. We're just pawns. The real game, it's up there. I'm sorry. -Did a cop show up here? -No, sir! -Are you lying? -No, sir, I'm not. Tell me the truth, or I'llâ¦ -Hey, what are you doing? -Shut up! -What? -Bhaisaab, the staff had called. He's behind the kitchen. Alright. Behind the kitchen. Let's go. Where's the key? Where's the key to these handcuffs? In the pocketâ¦ "In the pocket." Of course, it's in the pocket, dumbf***! How did you get my ID? Howâ¦ I'm gonna keep your car. Which one do you drive? Walk home, f***er! I would like to raise a toastâ¦ to my amazing husband! Thank you for always protecting me. Thank you for always being there with me when things gotâ¦ rough. Hey! Stop! In all our difficult timesâ¦ you always stood by my side. You are my rock. Cheers! -Thank you. -Congratulations. Thank you. Who's this guy? What's going on? Is this someone you know? Papa?

Are you alright? I should be asking you that. -What are you looking at? -No, sir. Nothing. Hey, stop! Stop. Why aren't you answering your phone, man?! Why aren't you answering your phone, man?! What the f***! They've thrashed you. Sir, did he thrash you a lot? Sumair has gone rogue in our department, Aditi. Sir, I'm not completely sure about that. What do you mean? He told me that he was working undercoverâ¦ to expose a senior officer from the departmentâ¦ who's the center of this drug nexus. And Jaggi works for that officer. Did you get it? I've spent the past ten years of my life chasing corrupt officers like him! This is what they all say when they're caught. "I was working undercover." Sumair is a threat to our department. Sumair is a threat to our department. I know where the bag is. You're worried about the bag? Where's Athi? If I see him nowâ¦ I'll take him down personally. He's toying with you.

Are you f***ing scared? -Shut up! -Shoot him! He wants to die! -Hey, Sikandar! I know this is your plan! He's working with you -and you wanna take all my stuff! -Shut up! Shut up! You've been chewing my ear off all evening! -Shut up! -I've made you what you are! He was a small-time dope peddler at Majnu's shop! I turned the business white! Coke was my f***ing idea! Balls, it was your idea! -I've taken this business from you! -Hey, shut up! -You're a f***ing pimp! -Ask your wife who the real pimp is! Ask her why your daughter doesn't look like you! -Quiet! -And you know that smokin' tattoo on her left thigh?! -That was my idea as well! -Shut the f*** up! Hey, I'll shoot you! Flour? Really? Where's my son? Shit! Jaggi! Jaggi! Look, I don't have the time for this. Tell me where the bag is, or I swear on my kids' lives I'll kill your son. Check the car. There's one more dead body here.

He's getting smart with me. Don't grow up to be a man like your father, alright? Come on, Vicky! My mood is ruined. Let's get a drink. Pick up! Pick up! Please, Dad! Pick up! -Hello? -Dad! It's me. Whose phone is this, Athi? Sikandar's brother. They've just gone out. They're threatening me, Dad! What? Yes, Dad. Did anyone hit you, son? Sikandar's brother hit me.
