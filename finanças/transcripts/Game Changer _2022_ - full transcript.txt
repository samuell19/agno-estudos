Stay tuned to sports talk 101.7, The Zone, home of your Atlanta Knights. Coming up, we have reigning MVP Jordan Gabriel on to talk about his record setting season, and what a year he had! Too bad that with all those personal accomplishments, he still hasn't found the secret to leading his team to that elusive championship. All from money. Yeah! Hey, where's my money? Hey Jordan, you there? Hello? Earth to Jordan? ♪ Easy ♪ You make it so easy. Just a couple more songs and we need to be leaving, honey. Okay, mommy. Hey, Bud? ♪ Easy ♪ You make it so easy. Little Gabriel has the ball. Will he make the pass? Oh, and the crowd goes wild! ♪ The ordinary people will say He takes the snap. He scrambles, he spin moves, hits Antwon Race for the championship. Lohan Paul Everett! Sorry, mom. Honey, you need to study. Your grades have been slipping too much since we moved. I know, it's just, I can't concentrate, Mom, I'm so excited. It's the Jordan Gabriel, my favorite player ever! I know, sweetheart. But if you don't get your grades up, there will be no baseball for you this year. If the school can even put a team together. I'm sorry. Really, when we get back, I promise I'll get right on it. At least an hour tonight. Okay, yeah, that's fine. Okay. Go get yourself cleaned up, we need to leave soon. Thank you so much, Mom! Oh, I hope he signs my jersey! Hey, buddy. How you doing today? You're the best, Mom. Totally. Dad would love this, huh? Yeah. Hey, how you doing? Ah! This never happens to you, does it? Obviously you're very special to him. Son, this is the moment you've been waiting for. I watched you on TV set the record for passing yards and I was in the stadium when you threw those seven touchdown passes! You're the greatest quarterback ever! Can I get a picture with you? Oh, and can you sign my jersey? This is so cool. It's Lohan. Mr. Gabriel? Mr. Gabriel, can you sign my jersey please? It's Lohan, L-O... Right, what, what? No, no dude, it's Jordan, J-O. Silly kid. There you go, little buddy. Hey, honey look, it's Antwon Race. Come on. Come on. Hey, how you guys doing? Lohan, honey, he didn't mean it. We just ran out of time. Here's another snippet from my interview with the reigning MVP. Jordan, you're a pretty competitive guy. What can I say, Jim? I like to be the best. You know, when I look in the mirror, I see nothing. Cause I'm so good, there can be only one of me. And his ego pretty much took over from there until I asked about his dad. Suffice it to say 30 years with no birthday presents, and there ain't gonna be any this year, either. Mi casa! Mi casa. Well, you're with a superstar now so get used to it. I still can't believe I'm in the final three for Magnifique. Like if I get this contract, I could be on the cover of literally every magazine. Dude, give me some good news. Well, normally 120 million dollars would be great news. I'm the best quarterback in the league. I don't play for number two money. Look, man, with the cap and all, it's maybe the best. No, no, no, that's not the best anything. I'm the best. And my pay had better reflect that. You weren't the best in that Detroit game last year. You cost me a lot of money in my fantasy football league that day. Yeah, easy pal. Not a good time. Fair enough. But since you're the best and all, why don't you gimme a chance to win back some of my money that you lost? Come on, Jordan, let's just go. That your car? You better believe it. Okay, well mine's coming. You wanna? That's a Lamborghini, pal. It's not about the car. Jordan, come on. Well, it ain't about you either. Really? Well I know the perfect space. Lead the way. Okay. Jordan! Jordan, this is crazy. Jordan, stop! The Jordan Gabriel. Do you feel the rules don't apply to to you? No, sir, they most certainly do. Says here you were clocked at 147 miles per hour and racing another car. Look, it was a terrible lapse in judgment, your honor. But trust me, it'll never happen again. Yeah? That's not going to work with me. See, this offense is a misdemeanor, but it carries a sentence of up to 90 days in jail. But I have an idea. Clearly, money's no object to you, Mr. Gabriel. And although some confinement may do you good, I'm gonna give you the opportunity to help somebody else. I'd like you to report to Johnson Middle School for your spring assignment. It's that or jail. That. Good. You successfully complete the program, I'll dismiss your case. It'll be as if it never happened. No. Thank you, your honor. Report back here in two weeks with an update. That was a miracle. The contract you want, if you go to jail, poof! Come on. I can't believe it! Jordan Gabriel is coaching the Johnson Middle School baseball team. Welcome. Wow, you are huge. I always thought maybe the cameras just made you look bigger. Jordan Gabriel! Oh, I see you met Sadie, our student teacher. Oh, thank you so much for coaching our kids. Oh, you know cause we couldn't afford a coach this year, but thank you, thank you. And anything you want, anything at all, I'm your lady. Okay. Can I have my hand back? Oh! Silly. I'm on my way back to my classroom. I can show him to the ballfield. Nope, I got this. Okay, yeah. All right, well let me show you the way. Okay, all right. No one is gonna believe that Jordan Gabriel is at my school. You know those are some very big muscles. You must work out a lot. Little bit. Can I feel y'all. Uh, this one? Cause you're feeling that one already. Oh. Busted. It's all right. Well, this is my room. Oh! You know what, silly me. Okay, so the field is to your left over here. And there's the equipment, and yeah, just do what you do. Look, Mr. Gabriel, I'm sure you are a very nice guy and those muscles are, oh, they do tricks, oh, very distracting. But these are my kids! Mhmm. And looks can be deceiving. Now I know what you did to get here. Mr. Speed Racer. Okay, and I don't care about your fame or your fortune or that physique, but it's you as much to sneeze on one of my kids, it will not cover you. You're in my world now. Do I make myself clear? Crystal? Good, all right. Well here's all the files on the kids as well as any pertinent medical information. If you have any questions, you know where to find me, okay? Oh, and your vroom vroom, you know, secret, is cool with me. Baseball. Nah, this is my team. We do things my way around here, got it? You gotta be kidding me. - Got it? - Stop, guys, chill out. Look. Hey, what's going on here? Now new kid thinks he can tell us what... Well, because some judge thinks he can tell me what to do and clearly he can cause here I am. Tada! That makes me the new coach. So I'm gonna tell you what to do. And for starters, you two need to hug this out. What was that? You really are Jordan Gabriel. I better be. I'm wearing his underwear today so there's that? Good one. Oh man. This year's gonna rock. Dude, I saw you threw five touchdowns in one game last year. My first name's Gabriel. This is so cool. Have you ever met someone that you just idolized your entire life? Someone you never thought you'd have the chance to meet and then you get to take a selfie with them? Well, get your camera out, I don't have all day. Good one. Anybody else got anything to say? Yeah. Does your little sister know you're wearing her shirt? Hey! I'm Stephanie. Would you wanna warm up together? Sure. I'm Lohan. Isn't this awesome? That's Jordan Gabriel. All right, come on, let's go. Okay. Hey, kid. It's Lohan. Good to know. Jordan Gabriel. I know, I know, I know. You're pleased to meet me. Look, kid, I'll even autograph your ball when practice is over. But for right now, I just need to see if any of you guys can hit. All right, line up. Come on, coach! Bring the heat! Watch it, right here. Yo, coach, that almost hit me. I'm out! Of course, they can't. Man, this is cool, being coached by Jordan Gabriel. Okay. Can anyone here pitch? I've pitched before. I'd like a shot at it. Let's see what you can do. Whoa. Whoah. Maybe there's some hope for me yet. Oh, wow. Hey. So you're a teacher here. Yep, that's what they tell me. Oh, so you're the new coach? Yeah, well that's what they tell me. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, ooh! So. I think I saw you at an autograph signing last week, right? Yeah. My son Lohan and I, we just moved here and he tried to get you to sign his jersey. Oh, I don't remember signing any jerseys. I know. Oh. Wow, I'm sorry. I must have totally missed that. It was really busy. I know you didn't do it on purpose. No, no, definitely not. Well, the kids are really excited to have you, I'm sure. They'll have a lot of fun with you. Yeah, so... Maybe we could have time around being fun. What, what? What? What did you just say? Huh? You just said something. Hmm. So I'll see you tomorrow. Well, I'll be here. Okay. And thank you for bringing us Mr. Gabriel so Lohan can play this year, even if he's a bit of a self-absorbed narcissist. I think that's how mommy said it. Anyway, I also pray for Mr. Gabriel and that you'll keep Lohan healthy and safe. In Jesus' name, Amen. Kids. Ooh! Right in the face. Are you okay, Mr. Gabriel? Yeah, I meant to do that. You're hilarious. Well, good luck today. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Central Atlanta Little League. It's a beautiful day for baseball, but this is gonna have to do. Looks like it's gonna be impossible to count the number of fans in attendance today. Literally. All right, guys. Let's have Lohan start at pitching. Gabriel, let's put you on first. And John, you go to short. Yo, coach. I play shortstop. Yeah, and in case you didn't notice, I play catcher. Okay. Tell you what, why don't you guys just go where you normally go. Sounds good to me. Hey, what position do you play? Bench warmer. Pine rider, dugout security. My personal favorite, guy who never gets hit by the ball. All righty, then. Woo! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoah! Go Warriors! Warriors are awesome, warriors are... Whatever, go Warriors! Hey fans, it's dad joke time. What has 18 legs and catches flies? A baseball team. Just not this team. Yeah! Go! But this kid, he's one to watch. Hey Brandon. Do us a favor and don't strike out this time. Ha ha, very funny. Maybe if you caught a ball or two, we wouldn't lose every game. Was I talking to you? No, you were talking to me. Guys, enough, stop! Look. Just all of you, play better. Come on. If you want a hot dog, now's the time to get it. That's why I'm here. Turns out though that snack mom is a vegan. She won't eat anything that casts a shadow so she only brought us non GMO, gluten free cage-free, taste-free veggie dogs. Mm boy, we'll need a half-caf sugar-free, organic vanilla latte with almond milk to wash down that deliciousness. Hey mom, I'll take mine to go. Hey pitcher! Hope you're not too attached to that ball, cause you can kiss it goodbye! Sayonara! And we can actually win this game. Hey, Willie! Yeah, coach? Just hit a homer. Thanks, coach. Would have never thought of that. Strike! Hits a shot deep to left. It's going, it's going. Foul ball! Oh, just foul. You're kidding. What a shot. Come on, Willie. Win this game, he'll come. He'll come back. Strike three, batters out. And that's the game, folks. When am I ever gonna catch a break? I'm so sorry. Okay, I didn't mean it. It was, it was an accident. I'm thinking making a joke right now would be a little inappropriate. Look, I doubt you got to where you are on football in a year or two. The way I see it, you could be a real game changer for them. Okay, but maybe not right now. You poor thing, you need some ice. But I'm a believer. Don't give up on them, or yourself. Mr. Gabriel. How's it going? Painful, your honor. Look, I'm not sure what you're expecting of me here. I'm expecting you to help these kids. I'm not sure anybody can help these kids, man. They might be a lost cause. There's no such thing as a lost cause, Mr Gabriel. What is a hero? I'm sorry, what? Define what a hero means to you. I guess I'm not sure. A hero is simply someone who uses what they have to help others. Now, whether you like it or not, you're a role model. And all I'm asking is that you use those talents and abilities to help these kids. Commit to something greater than yourself. Become a hero. I have it on good authority that you're not taking this little exercise of ours seriously. I have eyes and ears everywhere, Mr. Gabriel. You're not going to be able to skate through this. And to help incentivize you to stop wasting your talent and my time, you'll win the city championship or you will still serve your jail time. Oh, it's gonna take a miracle. Then I suggest you step up to the plate and become that miracle. You have a chance to stand in the gap for these kids. You're dismissed. Hey. Have you heard from any other agents here? No, not yet. Jordan, 120 is literally every penny they have under the cap. No. Is anybody else throwing 56 TDs and hitting practice reps the next day? Who else is in the gym every night? That's my money. I earned it. Okay. Jordan, everybody knows you're the hardest working dude in football. But if you don't win that championship, I can't get you a contract. Jordan. I need this taken care of. The next phone call I get from you had better be about my money. What's the hold up? Hey, that was fast. Well, I aim to please? But what? Sorry, man. I thought you were Sebastian with contract news. Oh. No such luck. How you doing? Fine. You know, it'll come through. Like you always say gotta have faith, right? Yeah. That's not how that works or what I meant. How are you doing? Honestly, bud, I've been better. The baseball? Maybe this is all just an opportunity to get past your history there. I think you might be the perfect person to help these kids. You know, this is all just tryouts for the big leagues. You're talking about heaven again, right? You know I don't believe in that anymore. I know. I was there when he left you. It's hard to believe in a father that you can't see, especially with the one that you could but was never there for you. I know you don't believe in God right now, but he believes in you. And brother, he wants a relationship with you again. Look, bud. I'm only a phone call away. I'm praying for you. What are you drawing over there? That's John Smoltz. Yep. Guys, great week of practice. As in hall of Famer, John Smoltz? Mhmm. Really proud of you. Cy Young winner. Right. Remember in this game, the fundamentals we worked on, just be loose, be live and ready. Probably the best to play the game. Yo, this isn't helping. All right? Remember, have fun. Lions on three. Go Lions! Dude, we don't have a chance. Alrighty then. Good pep talk. Let's do this every game. Hey, John! Okay guys. Look, I'm really proud of you, okay? For what, coach? Yeah, we stink. Okay. Let's just remember what we practiced this week, okay? What exactly was that, coach? You didn't really work on anything with us. All right. Then let's just go have fun out there. Come on guys, you can do this, come on. Strike three! Hurray, good job, guys! Hey, pitcher. Yeah, great job, good pitch. Strike one! Oh, come on, Willie. Coach, he's trying way too hard. He just needs to relax. Time! Look, bud. I know how cool it is to be the hero with everybody watching. But look, we've got runners in scoring position. So just settle in, relax. Take a deep breath. Just get a hit. Not everybody's watching. What? Never mind. I got it, coach. There's a deep shot! It's going, it's going. It's gone! Hey, bud. That is one for the books, man. What a shot, folks. I'm actually glad I came today. Man, that kid can hit. And he ties the game up. Man, I have got to win this game. Hey, you're up man. You go get 'em. Bottom of the six, then final inning, Warriors up by one. Come on, guys. Ball! Ball. Come on, Lohan! Your arm's better than that! Come on man, bring it. You're doing a good job, babe. Ball four, take your base. Time. Hey, what's going on? I need to win this game. Coach, I can do this. Seriously, I'm fine. Yeah. Deshawn. Hey, I like the attitude, I really do, but I've got way too much on the line here. Look, you'll get 'em next time. All right, little buddy, take us home. Coach, you sure about this? Yeah. You were the pitcher before Lohan got here, right? Yeah, but... But nothing. Take us home, I need this win. Coach, Lohan told me to come out here for some reason and I'm totally cool just going back and keeping the old bench warm for you. Yeah. Brandon, come on into first. I need you to go stand out there. And do what? Hopefully nothing. Well, well, well, here's a head scratcher. The coach just replaced one of the only kids on the team who even realizes they're playing baseball! Go figure. Check it out, the right fielder is chasing a butterfly. Might be the only thing he catches all day. Oh, boy. You've gotta be kidding me. Uh-oh. So I've gone from lifestyles of the rich and famous to an episode of the ridiculous and inept. Now that's one of the craziest home runs I've ever seen. Wait to use your head, little buddy! Game over. Didn't you test yourself before the game? No. Lohan. I was just so worried that coach was gonna think that I'm like, weak. Buddy, we are far beyond that. This is very important. We have talked about this. That can't happen again. Yes, ma'am. I just want you to be healthy. Buckle up. Son? You do not get to call me that. Come on, it's been a long time. Not long enough. Could you let it go? I just want to talk. No. Whatever it is you're asking for, the answer is no! This is goodbye. Hey. Hey. Come on in. How you doing? Fine. So how did practice go? Better. Been thinking about what you said and though it's not all totally registering yet, it's starting to make sense. So, thank you. So I don't see a wedding ring. Safe to assume you're just too good for their father? I mean, you are a strong six, maybe even a seven. Well, it's a scale of one to five. My husband was a Captain in the Marines. Oh. He was serving overseas. They came under fire. He sacrificed himself for his friends. He did the right thing. He was a hero. I'm sorry. I just have a lot going on and I haven't talked about that a long time. Is there something I can do to help? No, thanks. My parents passed away a couple years ago. Their house in South Carolina just sold so I have to go down and help my brother take care of some things tomorrow and I cannot find anybody to keep the kids. I'll take 'em. No, I can't ask you to do that. You didn't ask, I offered. Are you sure? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Thank you. Good morning. - Morning. - Good morning. Come on in. - Wow. - Ooh. Thank you for keeping the kids this weekend. Oh, and for taking them to Michael's birthday party. The address is right here. Oh, you're welcome. Hey, guys, hey. Wow. I love you. Yeah, okay. Listen to everything that Mr. Gabriel has to say. Okay. Maybe not everything. I really have to go, I'm sorry. Oh, no worries. Oh, let me. Drive safe. Okay, we can do this. This place is awesome. Yeah, it works. So... Breakfast? Sure. All right, kitchen's down the hallway all the way down to the right. Follow that hallway all the way down to the left. Yeah, right. I'm serious. It's a big house. You guys can go. I'll catch up later. Flip it over. Is this for me? Well, couldn't have you wearing a store bought one so... That one's from my seven touchdown game. Wow. I hear you asked some ogre a couple of weeks ago for his autograph and you never got it. It was a busy day for you. It's all right. No, no, it's not. And that one's right from the game. It's all yours. I'm gonna make so much money off of this. Hey! I'm just kidding. Thank you so much. You're welcome. All right, eat up. What? You're supposed to pray before you eat. You pray a lot, don't you? Yeah. Talk to you all, too. Yeah, but, I mean, you guys lost your father. I didn't lose him. I know exactly where he is. He's in heaven. How do you have such faith? How could you not? Jesus brought my daddy home. I miss him, but I know that I'll see him again one day. Let's eat, ready? Ooh, okay. Any day now, the food's getting cold. All right. Ooh. Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord, my soul to keep? What are you doing? Yeah. It's been a while. You don't say. Maybe a little help? Okay. It's not really hard. You just do these simple things. Put your hands together. Close your eyes and say what you need to say. Dear God, thank you for this food and mommy, and Lohan, and Mr. Gabriel. In Jesus' name, Amen. You have a chandelier in your kitchen! Yeah, two of them. You look like one of Lohan's dolls. They're action figures, not dolls. Collectors items. Sweet! You think I look like an action figure. Thank you! It wasn't a compliment. It was. No it wasn't. Yes, it was. Mmm-mm. - Mhmm. - Mmm-mm. Alrighty then. What's that? That's my protein powder. What do you do with it? Well, first they pay me the big bucks. Then I get the big muscles when I drink it. Wait, but it's powder. Yeah, you add water to it. Can I try? Dude, does she have an off button? Nope. All right. Okay, so you put in a scoop of protein. And for me I need two. And you add some water. And then... Sorry. Are you mad? Nope. What about now? Where are we going? Away from all my stuff. Nope, there's only one seat. So what? You're tiny, you'll both fit. That's not safe. Mr. Gabriel. Look, there's a zero chance I'm even gonna scratch this baby. You'll be fine. I don't think that's even legal. We can take that. Ha, no, that's a minivan. That's my pool guy's. Absolutely not. Thank you Mr. Gabriel. You're very not welcome. Huh. Hey buddy. You mind typing in the GPS there for me? I think I got my hands full. What is this, like six, maybe 70 horsepower? Vroom, vroom. Mom texted. So we gotta pick up Emily and... Stephanie. Stephanie? Aha. So that's why you're wearing that cologne today. What cologne? The one you're wearing, what is that? Smells a little bit like anxiety. No, no, no. Ooh, no, that is definitely sheer terror. I remember my first crush. My hands would get all wet and nasty and my mouth would get all dry and sticky. I couldn't talk. It was like, today. I was a mess. It's not funny. Yeah, it kind of is. You're just on the wrong side of the joke. What'd you do about it? Look just relax. Plus, hey, you know me. You got that going for you, that's all you need. Wait, but she knows you too now. Oh yeah, huh. Well you're on your own then. So, good luck with that. Hey, look buddy. You're a great guy, all right. You got a lot going for you. She's gonna like you, don't worry about it. If she doesn't like you for you, her loss. Just relax. Do it fast. Cause the way I drive, we're gonna be there at like 1.5 minutes tops. So Steph says you cheer at their games. Yeah, I try. Can I help? I mean, I could even teach you some new cheers. That would be great! We could definitely use the help. Hey, you good? Yeah. I ate a big breakfast, I'm stuffed. Tell me about it, man. Hey, just relax. You got this. Hey, find something on the radio. Try 104.7. That's my favorite station. Girls, hey, sorry. Takes a lot of protein to feed all these muscles and, that one just slipped out apparently. Oh! Ew, it's so gross! You should smell it up here. It's burning my nose, oh! That, that is gross. I don't know, man. I'm not so sure these kids can win a single game. What can I do? That's not the point. These kids need some consistency in their lives. Somebody to show them work ethic, teamwork. You know, like a coach. Remember what Coach Siebersman always said? Become the person that you needed. Why don't you try that? You're headed in the right direction. Now just keep going. Look, guys. I just can't coach a motley looking group of goofballs like yourselves. So we got a problem. Motley shmotley! I make this look good. I mean it's kind of hard to coach when you're not even coaching, coach. - That hurts. - Ooh. Fair point, Willie. And I'm working on that. Look guys, I'm new to this. And clearly I dropped the ball so far. So how about we take a step back and we do this together as a team? But if we're gonna do this as a team, we gotta look like a team. So head on into Miss Everett's room for a little surprise. Okay? Yo, what does motley mean? I don't know. Huh? Man, you guys look great. Let's do this. Yeah! Wait, wait, wait, wait. We're not gonna practice in these. Go change back. - Oh. - What?! Thanks, coach. Hey, buddy. Mind if I show you a new pitch? New pitch? I didn't think you knew anything about baseball or even cared. Well, it's something my dad showed me. It's about the only thing my dad showed me. Wait a second. Ian Gabriel is your dad? The hall of fame pitcher from Dallas? That's him. Look, man, this pitch didn't do me any good, but I think it's something that could help out the team. So it's time I pass this along. Okay, well thank you. Warriors on three. One, two, Three, Warriors! Looks like you're doing a good job here. Can I just talk to you for a minute? What? I just wanted to let you know that I'm not feeling too good lately. Are you sick? No, no, no, you know, no. Sorry if I really don't care. You have ever right to feel that way. I just wanted to ask for your forgiveness. Forgiveness? You want me to forgive you? No, no, no, no, no, no. Forget you! It's something you're really good at. No, I'm sorry. What's one? Oh, one! Then two. Three. Oh, these uniforms are so cool. I know. I just have to warn you, I'm not very good at this. Oh, that's okay, just follow my lead. Okay, okay, so we're gonna go up. Up? And then down, well kind of in and then down. Willie, turn two. And it's a grounder hit to short, fields it, throws to second for the out, she fires to first for the 6, 4, 3 double plays. Yeah, woo, yeah, woo hee! Good job, Willie, good job! Well tune in next week, folks. When that kid's featured on the show, the best or nothing, gonna be a really short show. I heard the burger shack is hiring, Just thinking about using you as a reference. That could be a fun job. All right guys. Great job so far. Look, if we stick together, we can win this one, okay? Hands in, on three. One, two, three, Warriors! I got it, I got it. Thanks for coming out, you know I would have never gotten that play. Dude, we win as a team now. A swing and a miss for strike three. Looks like he was swinging for the fences on that one. I'm sorry, coach. I shouldn't have gone for the home run. I should have just tried to get on base. Hey it's okay, all right. Look, that pitcher over there is throwing an amazing game. He's got a no hitter going. But so do you. Hey, I think now's the time to break out the pitch. I think you're right. All right, let's show 'em what you got. Strike three, bats out. - Yeah! - Lohan! - Good job, baby! - Good job! One two three! ♪ Our team is boom, dynamite ♪ Our team is boom, dynamite ♪ Our team is tick tick tick tick tick tick tick ♪ ♪ Boom, dynamite And up to the plate steps the next stop, ah, the batter. Strike one. Strike two. Coach, that bat is as tall as he is. He ain't ever gonna hit it holding like that. Wow, how did I miss that? You were probably on your phone. Sorry. Yeah, don't be. I deserve that. Hey, thanks. Time! Elijah. Hey, buddy, let me show you how to hold the bat, all right? I need you to choke up on it a little bit. So bring your other hand up, this hand down. Keep 'em nice and tight together. This is gonna help you get the batter on faster, okay? Now watch the ball all the way from the pitcher's hand, straight on into the bat. You follow the ball into the bat, you're gonna get a hit. You got it. You better believe I'm gonna get a hit. I'm gonna kiss this ball goodbye. And strike three. Wait, what, he hit the ball? Go, go, go! Go, go, go! He hit it, I don't believe it! Run, tiny, run! He's going to third! Look at that little guy run! I haven't seen this many errors since yesterday! No, no! No, no, no, no! Go back, go back, go back! Go, go! He's safe! He did it, woo! A truly impossible play! Like no way that just happened! Hoho, I've seen it all now. Oh! And there is nothing real left in the world anymore. What? You make no sense sometimes, really. That makes perfect sense. You're just being a goof. - Hey. - Okay. Jordan, how did practice go? Good. Spent about an hour with him this afternoon working on math, trying to get him ahead of the test tomorrow. Hey I told Lohan I would show him where the breaker is so he could fix it himself next time. What? He said you tripped a breaker, asked me to come inside and show him where it might be. No, we're fine. Okay. I made more dinner than we can eat. You're welcome to stay. Hmm. Are you a good cook? I can hold my own. Sounds great then. Scooch over, tiny. Seems you made quite an impression on them. Well, they're great kids. Mom's pretty cool too. Why, thank you. Sorry. Little awkward. I'm feeling like a teenager again. I think it's cute. Well, at least one of us is enjoying it. You should see the way this light makes you look right now. Yeah? Yeah, you look awful actually. No, hold that face. Seriously, I have to get a picture of this. What? No. I'm joking, I'm joking. But seriously, somebody's gotta keep your ego in check. Oh, wow. Yeah, well, agreed. But hey, you know, looks aren't everything. Though you do have to admit that these big biceps are kind of cool. I think that a big heart takes the cake. Yeah. Well I'm training that a little more now too. You ready for the next game? Only one win away from the championship, right? Yeah, man, I really hope we're ready. Got a lot riding on these next two games. Part of my deal with all this, is that I have to actually win the championship or I spent some time in jail. And I'm gonna lose my contract and probably lose everything. Oh. Yeah. I didn't know that. Mom? Lohan won't play with me anymore. He ran away. Honey, Mr. Jordan and I, we're... If you don't mind, I'll handle this. What are you doing? Yeah, gotcha. I gotcha! Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Horsie or car? - Horsie! - Horsie? You know what? You're it. Woo! Get him, get him, get him! Hey. You guys have helped us out a tremendous amount this season. So to show my appreciation, I figured I was gonna show you a new cheer or two. No offense, Mr. Gabriel, but you kind of move like a robot. Yeah, more like a broken robot. What? I don't move like a broken robot. Aw. All right. How about if they show you? No way! Hi. Hey, buddy. Hey. You ready? Oh, yeah. Sweet, man. Let's get out here and get warmed up. All right. We got a championship to win. Yes, sir. Today's game is brought to you by, Strike! Sheer luck. Strike three! Oh, no no no no! Oh no! Oh, brother. Hey. It's been a really long game, hasn't it? Yeah. I do have a little headache, but I'm fine. We've gotta win this game. That a boy. Just relax. Hey, you got this. Last inning, bottom of the sixth. Warriors up by one. There it is, yeah. Great pitch! Good job, Lohan! One more, just like that. Full count, three and two. One more strike and the warriors are headed for the championship. Strike three! Yes, yeah woohoo! I don't believe it, the Warriors are headed to the championship. Great job, Lohan! - Lohan! - Lohan! That's it. Lohan, Lohan, what happened? Are you okay? I forgot to take my test. I'm sorry, Dad. Lohan! Lohan, are you okay? What's wrong? Lohan. Call 911. Okay, it's okay. Just flip him on his side. - Hey. - Hey. How's he doing? Better. He's resting. He had a complication with his diabetes. Ketoacidosis. His doctor said it can be very serious, even life threatening if he has another episode like this. Life threatening? Jen, I had no idea he had diabetes. You had his medical records. No. Oh, wow. I'll bet that was in that stack of papers Aretha gave me the first day. I'm sorry, I... You didn't look through them? No. You mean to tell me that he was out there all this time with no one monitoring him? Look, I'm sorry. You're sorry. I didn't do it on purpose. Jordan, I know that there is so much more to you than this. But when are you gonna realize that the world doesn't revolve around Jordan Gabriel? Look, you know what? Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jordan. How you feeling, honey? Better, I guess. Am I still gonna be able to play? Yes. The doctor said you were fine. That's why he let you come home tonight. We just have to be very careful. Is coach Gabriel gonna leave? I don't know. I miss Dad. How much? Jordan. How much do you want? I don't need your money. Look. I know that I failed you. I need you to know that I'm sorry. Do you think that gives you a right to come back now? Probably not. You know, when I was little, my friends would play catch with their dads. If I even wanted to see you, I had to turn on the TV and watch you play a game. A game that I have hated ever since! This was a mistake. Please, I need to make amends. Make amends? For what, the missed birthdays, Christmases, little league, college, draft day? I'm not six years old anymore crying myself to sleep, hoping that you would walk right back through that same door you walked out of! What are you gonna do? You're gonna go back in time? Teach me how to throw a ball, fix my bike, drive a car? I spent my whole life trying to become the best, holding on to some pipe dream that one day I'd be good enough that you would finally come back. Look at you. You're a washed up has been, and I'm the best in the world, the best! I don't need you! I'm sorry, Father. He's right. I'm so sorry. Then why did you leave? Why did you leave us? Why did you leave me? I was chasing things that didn't matter. I lost sight of the things that did. It was the biggest mistake of my life. For the first time in my life, I've found peace. Save for one thing. And I want you to find it too. Where were you, huh? Where were you when Ian walked out? Where were you? Where are you? Here. He's always been here. You just stopped looking. And understandably so. You know, I find those work better in one piece. I went to see Ian. He asked me to forgive him. Wow. You never said it but I always knew why you hated this game, why you stop believing. How do you do it? Well, it helps if the bat actually touches the ball. I walked into that one, huh? Yeah, yes you did. You've always tried to be the best. You tried to earn back his love. Love doesn't work like that. And then you tried to fill that void with trophies, fame, fortune, thought you could do it all by yourself. But I think that you finally realized none of that truly made you happy. No. You've changed these last few months, man. Look in the mirror and tell me that you're not better off after helping all those kids. Good thing God gives us plenty of do-overs. All you gotta do is learn from your mistakes, adjust, and start again. Could it even be that simple? Simple? Yeah. Easy, no. But everything changes the moment you start living for other people. Look, I know your life hasn't been easy, being abandoned by Ian and all. But you have a heavenly father who will never leave you, who wants a relationship with you so badly that he sent Jesus to redeem you, to redeem me. Hey, to redeem Ian. Life's about relationship. With God, with his children. It simple, but it ain't always easy. I could have never imagined all this. God, it's been such a great year. And God I know I normally don't ask you for wins, God, but this one, this one is different. Because it's for coach. And God, please, please keep me safe. In Jesus' name. Amen. Welcome to the Central Atlanta Little League Championship and the end of one of the craziest seasons I've ever seen. Whoa. We made it. No way. Oh yeah. This is sweet. Whitefield, here I come. Mamma mia. This is so cool. Look at all my fans. Who told them I was here? Hey, Lohan. You tested yourself today, right? Yeah, yes sir, promise. Hey everyone, come on. Let's get our hands in, Warriors for the win. Let's win this, guys. One, two, three! Warriors! Let's go! Runner on third. No score in the first inning. Ground ball to short hand. Runner goes for home, can they make the play? Safe! Safe at home! Warrior strike first, up one to nothing. That boy's gonna win this game for you all by himself! Wow! Did, did somebody call for Goliath? Would you look at the size of that kid! They say he has a twin brother. Kinda looks like he ate him. Wow. You're big. But are you fast enough? Whoa, he got all of that one. - No! - It's going and it's gone. It's all right, Lohan. You'll get 'em next time. Yes! Good hit, that's what I'm talking about! Let's win this game, coach. Bottom of the second. Warriors take the field up two to one. Whoa, what a catch by Willie. Amazing! Man, I'll tell you that kid's fun to watch. Come on, Gabriel. Move quicker than that! My grandma moves faster than that, come on. It's okay guys. Let's focus! It's been a nail biter with a Warriors still up by one. But Godzilla is back up to bat. Let's see what Lohan's got for him now. Good pitch, good pitch! Yeah. Just like that, Lohan. Hit deep to right. That one is drifting, drifting, foul! Wow, that was a close one. Full count on the big guy with the Warriors up four to three. Strike three! Good job! Way to go, baby! Nice job, Lohan! What an arm! That ball had more moves than a U-Haul truck! And the Warriors are still up by one. Is Lohan okay? He looks tired again. I don't know. Infield fly over third base. He's out! Grounded and short. He's up for a throw and just gets him at first. Come on, guys! We have to win this! Hey, we'll get it back. Trailing seven to four. The Warriors really need to turn this around quickly if they want to pull out the win today. There's a shot to deep left. He's drifting back to the track and, a spectacular grab against the wall on left. And here comes the throw to second, not in time. Runner takes his leg up. Whoa, whoa, what, faked him out? - Yes, yes. - Haha! Me too, the old hidden ball trick. Looks like the Warriors are still in this game. Bases loaded, Warriors still down by three. Willie stands alone at the plate with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Strike. Jordan. If you've got some kind of a miracle up your sleeve, now's the time. Hey coach, his dad no-showed again. He didn't even come to one single game. Huh, of all people to miss that. Time. Comfort food. I know, I know, I know. Take it slow. Don't try to be hero, just get a hit. You know, you're an amazing ball player, but an even more amazing young man. So there's only one thing left to do. Hit a homer? Nope. Tell you that I'm really proud of you. Thanks, coach. This is really good. Oh! Kind of thick though. Got any water? Not that I know of. Right now? Oh my gosh. We need water. Ready, okay. ♪ Who's up to bat ♪ Willie's up to bat ♪ Who's up to bat ♪ Willie's up to bat ♪ If I were you and you were me ♪ ♪ I'd soup up really fast ♪ I'd soup up really fast Hope you're not too attached to that ball. It's a rocket to left, where will it fly? It's outta here! He got one there, yeah! I need water right now! That's a grand slam for this talented ballplayer! Showoff. Yeah! Bottom of the final inning, Warriors up by one. Can they hold onto the win and cap a truly miraculous season? Ball. Come on. Don't do this now, don't do this now. Come on. Ball four. Ball four, take your base. Back to back walks. That puts the winning run on first. Is this you? This last few months? Now? Cause I'm about to do something that the old me would've never done. What you doing, coach? Growing. Dude, you're big. Aren't you huge enough? Apparently not. So, we're getting pizza later then, huh? Huh. I know this is gonna take some time. But as you know, I don't quit. And thanks for never giving up on me. Time. I'm sorry, coach. It won't happen again. I don't know. You're starting to look a lot like you did right before you passed out. I'm fine. Really, I can do this. Yeah. But last time you went from I can do this straight to the emergency room. Sorry, buddy. You played an amazing game. No, you can't take me out, coach. Coach we'll lose with Deshawn. We have to win this game. Yeah, which is why I have to take you out. You're not looking good at all. And your health- No! Coach, if we don't win today, I'm never gonna see you again. Yeah, you will. But what about your contract? You said, if we lose today, you're gonna lose everything. And I'm gonna lose you. You know about that. Yeah. I'm not taking that chance. It's a little awkward. I've never experienced anything like this. But you know, before I met you, all of you, I had everything that money and fame can buy. Turns out that was nothing. I spent my whole life chasing things that don't matter. I lost complete sight of everything that does. No, I'm not going anywhere. We're so close. I can do it. We have to win this. Yeah, we do. Which is why I have to take you out. Deshawn. Look, bud, you played an amazing game and I'm really proud of you, but there's way too much on the line. Yeah, coach? Take us home, little buddy. Coach, we did this before. Yeah, just remember what we worked on in practice, okay? Settle in, take your time. I know you can do it. Hey, you got this. Hey, buddy. Kind hard to catch a ball out there sitting in here, ain't it? Coach, this is a really, really bad idea. We worked on this in practice, man. You'll get it, come on. This is a really, really, really, really bad idea. What are you doing? Hey, have faith, man. Coach Gabriel brought Deshawn in to pitch for Lohan. Hmm, okay. Are they worth it? You know you're throwing everything away, right? No, not everything. Come on, Deshawn, you got this! Just like practice. Ball. There goes the contract. Poof. Hey, come on Deshawn, settle in, you got this. Come on guys, work together as a team. Yes, yes, good job, Deshawn. Good job! And a dribbler hit the short. Hits the lot of second for one, back to first. Safe! No, almost. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't watch anymore. I can't! Come on, good job, Deshawn. One out, Warriors up by one, but the winning run is on base and look who's up to bat, well, well, well. We got a little Babe Ruth here calling his shot. This doesn't look good. Warriors may need a miracle here. Yes, yes! Good job, Deshawn. Come on! Go Deshawn, strike him out! Here we go, you got it. Oh, no. And he crushes it to right, sending it deep. Uh oh, this kid here couldn't even catch a butterfly. Looks like it's a playable ball for him. I caught it! I caught it, everybody! Woo hoo hoo! Throw it, come on! Come on, throw it! There's only two outs! And he finally throws the ball as the winning run rounds third. Fires it away, it's gonna be a close play at home. He's safe! Wow, oh that was close, so close. The Warriors came within inches of winning everything, but came up just short. Folks, that one's gonna sting. Look guys, y'all played great today. We got here winning as a team, today we lost as a team. We've come so far this year. And honestly you guys have probably taught me as much as I've taught you. I'm proud of you, every single one of you. It's a great season. Hey, you're good buddy. What a game. So close. That couldn't have been an easy decision to make. No, it wasn't. His levels were a little low, but he's okay. It was probably just the stress of the game. So you could have finished it. It's okay, coach, you were just trying to help me. There was no way that you can have known. You did the right thing. Yeah. So about you and me. I'm an idiot. I wouldn't have gone that far. I would, I messed up. This whole time I've still just been thinking about myself. Can you guys forgive me? Oh no. What do you think, guys? I think so. I agree. Okay. How about we just take a step back and we start over? Okay. Hi. I'm Jordan Gabriel. Pleasure to meet you. The pleasure is all mine. No, no it's not. Everyone's going for pizza. See you there. Yeah, sounds great. Good job. I'd like to get in on the forgiveness, starting over, if I may. Yeah. I think I would really like that too. Forgive me. So I see you didn't win the championship. As per our agreement, your sentence is still 90 days in jail. Your honor, you're right. I failed. Bailiff. Before I sentence you, there are a few people who have a few things to say. What is this? I don't know. Whoa, whoa, what's going on? What, did you know about this? I had no idea. The kids wanted to share their testimonies on behalf of Coach Gabriel. You may proceed. Your honor, though we didn't win the big game, Coach Gabriel has taught us far more than any trophy could be worth. And thanks to him, I got a B plus on my math test. And I hate math. Your honor, Coach Gabriel is far from perfect. But he's a'ight. We'll take him as a coach any day. He's awesome. Yeah, yeah. All right, is there anyone else? Please don't take Mr. Gabriel away from us. Mr. Gabriel, this was never about winning a game. I just wanted you to see that using your talents and gifts to help others was the right thing to do for your life. To become a hero. Apparently you have done just that. So... your case is dismissed. What? What did he say? You're free to go. Wow. Okay. It's not over yet! You'll figure it out. Besides, I did catch her writing your name in her alphabet soup last night, so there's that. Really? No! Your ego is so gullible. Why would she do that? Good point. And guilty is charged. Hey. Go long. Now we're talking. Let's see what you got, old man. Oh, that's how it's gonna be. Well, chase this one down. Dude, oh! I just got you the biggest contract in sports history. You're kidding? Your team has agreed to the entire thing. All of it, dude. Dude, you really better not be kidding me. I'm not, man. You know how they did it? Your entire team was able to take pay cuts and now they can stay under the salary cap. You, my friend, are the man. Really? No deal. Whoa, whoah, hold on. What do you mean no deal? Look, man. I need them as much as they need me. I'm not taking a single penny from those guys. Why? Cause we're a team. Oh my... What? Wait, wait. 12, 12 million? Oh! Haha, oh my! Oh my!
