Kimo, you have committed the greatest crime of all. You have betrayed your own people. You have caused the death of your own father, once our mighty chief! For these sins you must die! Tano, you know I am innocent! My father died from the Black Plague. Lies will not save you! The devil dust of your American friends killed our great chief, killed many of our people! Tano, you fear the Americans because their medicine is stronger than yours! They come here as our friends to help us! Friends? Why didn't the Americans heal your father? You all know I was his father's best friend. I begged our great chief, do not listen to the false voices of the strangers. Listen to Tano, the wise one! His medicine will make you strong and well again. My father was sick and out of his mind with fever! Tano gave him the poison because you wanted to become the new chief! You and Tano are the guilty ones! You should die! The evil spirits have seized Kimo's mind! - His tongue has become a serpent. - I tell the truth! Ask my wife Korey. She was caring for my father when Tano and Maranka came with the poison! - What is it you wish me to say, Kimo? - The truth! Tell them the truth, that Tano and Maranka gave him the evil medicine that killed him! What medicine, my husband? The only thing he drank was the medicine you brought from the American doctor. Do you hear the truth from the wife of the guilty one? You broke the law of our tribe when you brought your father to the Americans! It was their fiendish, unholy devil dust that made him sick! Their medicine that killed him! For that you must die! Korey, why have you betrayed me? I will come back from the grave to revenge for myself. Tano! You can kill my body, but my spirit will never die! In death I will be stronger than you in life! Maranka, your days are numbered. May the gods curse you and Tano and Korey! I promise you all, I shall come back from hell and make you pay for your crimes! [crowd chatter] [tribal drums] [drums continue] How come the travel posters never mention the drums? Islands of romance. Islands of beauty. How come they never talk about the malaria and the jungle rots, the fever and the heat, the stupid blind ignorance, and those drums? Yes, that propaganda they feed the innocent tourist is enough to drive a man to drink. If I ever go back to the States, which seems unlikely, I'll become a research chemist in a distillery, and combine business with pleasure. You better lay off that stuff, Professor. You'll wake up in the morning with a hangover, but the drums will still be here. Drums don't bother me, Doc. As a matter of fact, they have a nice anthropological beat. Well, maybe we oughta record it, get it on the hit parade. All kidding aside, those drums sound like trouble. Trouble for us, I'm afraid. Ever since the old chief died, the natives have been staring at us with hate in their eyes. I tried to save his life, but the old chief was too far gone from that brew of bacteria the witch doctor fed him. By the time I got there, he was paralyzed, practically dead. I know. You did your best, Doc. No need to be nervous. Ordinarily, the natives on this island are peaceful enough. You mean they were peaceful enough until they dropped that atom bomb on the Nogassa Atoll. Fifteen hundred miles from here. Who would have thought that a freak typhoon could come out of nowhere and wreck all calculations. Well, the facts remain that the atomic fallout landed here and that we trusty scientists from the International Foundation came running with our little Geiger counters to investigate. What did we find? Plague! That's what's killing off the natives. It's not the fallout. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. You know, they heard about the fallout from the sailors on the boats that trade with the islands. They think of it as some kind of "devil dust". A curse brought along by the evil Americans. We know that's so much eye wash. We've checked the radiation on this island, it's only 3.05 roentgen. Hardly any more than an ordinary dental X-ray. Sure, reason's on our side, but they don't seem to be buying it. I'll tell you who poisons their simple minds. It's Tano, their witch doctor. He's afraid of losing his patients to modern medicine. Wants to keep them steeped in their centuries old superstitions. They worship him like some kind of high priest. Back in the States they don't regard doctors that way. Sometimes they don't even pay their bills. I know what's on your mind. It's written all over you. You'd like to go back home, wouldn't you? Is it that evident? Sure, I'd go back tomorrow, only... Only you'd like to take a bride with you and the girl says "no". Terry Mason's doing a great job on Baku Island. I don't think the Foundation would want to lose her. Why did I have to fall in love with a dedicated female scientist? She considers marriage some kind of prison. What do you expect from a pretty girl two years out of med college? She wants excitement, adventure. She thinks of routine as a middle age thing. There are sometimes I could kick her beautiful teeth in. Here I offer her the earth, the moon, the stars... and she prefers test tubes and a tiny Pacific atoll. Forget her! Find somebody else. I've tried! Dozens of times. Well? There's nothing like a cup of your battery acid to pep you up. Only it needs a little more acid. Generator 3 was acting up. Luckily, I caught it just in time. All I can say is Jones and Pierce sure picked a good time to to go over to Taenga Atoll with Reverend Cameron. They could've give me a hand. Ah, coffee? That's a very good idea. It'll taste better if you put a little iodine in it. I better drink it before it melts the spoon. [woman screams] Doc! Eddie! It's Mrs. Kilgore! I warned her never to leave the trading post during one of the native ceremonies. - Eddie, take her to the lab. - Okay, Doc. - Eddie, get me a wet towel. - Check. Oh, save me, save me, help me! Easy, Mrs. Kilgore, easy. Relax, your perfectly safe. You're among friends. Oh, it's awful. I was there. I saw them kill Kimo. The bloomin' cannibals. They stuck a knife right in his heart. It was horrible, simply horrible! And that native outside, he'd liked to have killed me if he could. You're all right now, Mrs. Kilgore. No one's going to hurt you. I'll have nightmares the rest of me natural life. The heathens. They ought to drop a bloomin' hydrogen bomb on 'em all - and blow 'em to pieces. - Now, Mrs. Kilgore try to control yourself. Don't be stingy at a time like this, Deary. My goodness, I must look ghastly in front of you gentlemen. There's nothing else I can do now. If you want me, I'll be in the radio room. [drumming continues] [Speaking native language] Mrs. Kilgore? You passed a cemetery during a native ceremony. That's why they sent a man out to try to kill you. Why, I just had to see you, Doctor. I ran out of that ducky medicine you gave me for my nerves. Doctor, you can't imagine the lonely life of a widow. Two husbands I've buried, and now thereâ€™s no one to care for me. Well, if we hadn't heard you scream, Mrs. Kilgore, we might be burying you beside your latest lamented husband. Well, I just couldn't stand those drums. Gave me a terrible case of the jitters. Oh, that horrible brute. I think he hit me. Doctor, wouldn't you like to examine me, see if I've suffered any injuries? Mrs. Kilgore, you appear to be in excellent shape. I'm afraid you're more frightened, than hurt. Seems like every place you go on this bloomin' island you break a tribal law or something. Soon as I find a buyer for the trading post, I'm taking off for Australia like a bird. I'm going to open a little tea shop. After two years in this bloomin' rat hole, I think I'll open a pub instead. Well, until you do leave, Mrs. Kilgore, I advise you to give the natives a wide berth. Well, I like that! My poor Eddie and me, we opened the trading post to help these unfortunate people. And you made a nice profit trading beads and knives in exchange for copper and the occasional pearls. Now that's not a nice thing to say. I bet you're getting paid handsomely by that International Atomic "whatsit" that sent you here! I don't know why you want to study those natives for anyway. Mrs. Kilgore, I'm afraid you don't understand them the way the good professor does. He considers them civilized in their own delightful primitive way. Why, he'll tell you a human sacrifice is no worse than a traffic accident. I still don't know why they killed Kimo. Such a nice polite fellow. Good looking too. He committed the crime of learning something about modern science. He wanted to help his people. And for that they killed him. Terrible thing. He was our one link with the natives. Our one chance to lick the plague. Well, whether they like it or not, we've got to stop this epidemic. Once we do that, they'll trust us again. Of course, I'm not educated like you two but it doesn't take much brains to see there's all kinds of strange things going on on this island. You're right about that, Mrs. Kilgore. As a matter of fact I think we could use some more help to study the situation. I'll mention that now in my report to Washington. Terry. Oh, Bill... Oh, your pulse needs to be steadied. You seem to be running a fever. At times like this a violent chemical reaction sets in. May I prescribe a cold shower? Oh, I've already had one. We have our own shower. We built it out of the finest rusty pipe we could find. Sounds like real luxury. Oh, Terry, you remember Eddie, don't you? He worked in Baku for awhile. Eddie! - Sure. - Hello, Eddie. Good to see you again, Dr. Mason. - Can I get your bags? - Yes, Please. Thanks Eddie. Terry, this isn't fair. I won't be able to keep my mind on my work with you here. I wish they'd sent somebody else. Then, this isn't your doing? You mean having you ordered here? Oh, you know howl feel about you, Terry. This is a danger spot. - A little plague doesn't worry me. - Ah, something worse. See that? Their witch doctor's got them all stirred up. Terry, why don't you go back to Baku. Have them send somebody else. I've never dodged an assignment yet, Bill. Dr. Falkner and Dr. Curly are my bosses. I can take orders only from them. Well... Okay, let's go. Welcome to the island of forgotten scientists, Terry. You can imagine how pleased we were when Washington radioed you're on the way. Oh, thank you. Professor, it's so good to see you. How's the work going? Fine. I think you'll find our tests very interesting. Well, I'm sure I will. We can talk shop later. - I'm sure you want to unpack first anyway. - Well... I'm doing some work in the lab and I'll see you at lunch. Give me all the Foundation gossip from Baku. Professor, it'll be a pleasure. Oh... Terry, this is Mrs. Kilgore. She runs the trading post They told me a lady doctor was coming, but I figured it would be one of them beanpole spinsters. Well, I'm a spinster all right, Mrs. Kilgore. But you ain't no beanpole, that's for certain. My, that's a lovely suit. Why thank you. I bought it on my last trip to Hawaii. Mmmm, that perfume smells real nice. That come from Hawaii too? No, I brought that from the States. It's Arpege and I have an extra bottle if you'd like one. Why that's right nice of you, Ducky. I mean, Dr. Mason. Why that's all right, Mrs. Kilgore. You needn't be so formal. You call me Ducky or Docky or anything you want to. I will, Deary. And you call me Meg. Oh, uh...Ducky? - Yes, Docky. - We've got your quarters ready. Mrs. Kilgore will take you over. I'll drop by later and pick you up. I knew you'd be tired from the trip, Ducky, so I got a native girl to help you. Oh, I thought Dr. Arnold said the natives were angry with us outsiders. The tribe considers Orchid an outcast. She's the girl I got for you. And being an outcast she's not subject to tribal law. Her mother was a native, but her father was Dutch. When her parents died, she was raised by Reverend Cameron, the missionary. - You want these bags now, Dr. Mason? - Yes, please. Thanks, Eddie. Come along, Deary. Oh, Terry? Yes... I'm glad you stayed. Thanks. I hope that you'll like it here. Oh, it's very nice, I'm sure I will. - Orchid, this is Dr. Mason. - Hello, Orchid. Eddie, I wonder if you can take me back to my quarters? - I'd be glad to, Mrs. Kilgore. - Oh, wait a minute, Meg. Mustn't forget that perfume I promised you. Thanks, Deary. Eddie, we'd better be going. - See you later. - All right. Why do they call you Orchid? Because they say I'm wild, like our flowers. I'm glad that they picked me to be your servant. Maybe I can earn money to go to other island, where they will not care that I am an outcast. Then maybe I will marry. - Are you married? - No. Perhaps if I were, I may not have come here. Orchid, how do you come to speak such good English? The Reverend Cameron taught me how. He's been like a father to me. - You certainly learned it well. - Thank you. You know, I think we'll get along fine. Terry, are you ready? I thought I'd show you around the lab before lunch. Hey, you're early. I see you're enjoying our luxury. It's wonderful! I'll be over as soon as I'm dressed. Okay- Norgu. I'm glad to see you. After Tano's orders forbidding the natives to come here I thought I'd never see you again. I was Kimo's best friend. I think the same way he did. That you have come to help our people. Tano could do nothing for my wife Dori. He does not know how to fight the plague sickness, nor the marks on her face. Dori, sit here. Ah, your face shows improvement. You are healing her, Doctor. Others in the village know you have chased away the evil spirits with your medicine. Nargu, this plague is very serious. Talk to as many of your people as you dare and get them to come here for treatment in spite of the danger. Tano has no medicine to cure the plague. There are many who do not trust you since Kimo's father died, Doctor. But it was Tano who gave him the poison medicine. Kimo said that too, before they killed him. I believe it, but others do not. Well, Dr. Mason. This is Dori. I'd like you to look at her. She's recovering from the plague, but seems to have suffered a slight radiation burn also. Had she a history of jungle rot or dermatitis before the fallout came? She had a history of eczema. It seemed to be almost cured before the fallout landed here. Before the former chief died and son was killed, the natives came to us for treatment. However, the new chief, Maranka, and his witch doctor Tano, forbid the natives to come here. Those who do are taking their lives in their hands. From the look of the scar tissue it seems to be responding to your treatment. Terry! You specialize in dermatology and the removal of excessive scar tissue. Have you any ideas? It would help our situation with the natives if we could speed up a recovery. Let's try formula X-37. We had some good results on Baku with It. We can begin treatment soon as the supplies are unpacked. Terry, I hear that your group on Baku have rebuilt human tissue destroyed by jungle rot. Yes, we had some luck, I guess. Let's hope your luck holds out. Dori, come back tomorrow and we'll try Dr. Mason's new medicine. I will bring her. Thank you. I'm glad you have confidence in Dr. Arnold, Norgu. He's a good man. Not evil, like Tano! Come, Dori. Our progress with these natives is very slow, Terry. Their superstitions are so deep rooted. Yes, I know. Well, where's that lunch you promised me? You're looking at the best French chef on this island. And wait until you taste his coffee. It was for you that I helped kill Kimo, my husband. And since he died the fire of your love has grown cold. I could never have a traitor like you as my wife. Get out of here! I know that you make those poison darts to kill the Americans. You are afraid of them. You throw me out so that you can make love to Naomi. You come from her hut many times. I picked the poison berries for you. We have enough, Naomi. We will go now. This could be for you, just as easily as for the Americans. Here you are, Terry. Nature's own flower shop. Orchids, Hibiscus, you name them, we have them. Thanks, Bill. It's very lovely. Almost as lovely as you are. I'm gonna fill your head every morning with jungle flowers. That's one of the advantages of living in this primitive area. You can give your girl a fortune in flowers, and it doesn't cost a cent. Terry... Bill, Dear. I'm not your girl, or anybody's girl. Why do you have to be so stubborn? Why don't you admit you love me? Then, when Reverend Cameron comes back, he can marry us and we can go back to the States and live like normal people. Depends on what you call normal. Being cooped up in a stuffy apartment having my ears blasted by rock & roll music isn't my idea of normal. Rock & Roll? Wait until you hear the native drums. They'll really rock you. Terry, what do you want out of life? Do you wanna go from one assignment to another, out here on the islands, like the Professor? Do you want to go through life alone? Don't you want a husband, children, like other women? You do love me, don't you? Admit it. I don't love you. Then Why'd you kiss me back? I don't know. My metabolism. It was unconscious, involuntary. Terry, will you stop being a doctor first and a woman second. Let your emotions rule you, not your intellect. Bill, I live by my intellect, reason. If I let my emotions run away, I wouldn't be any good in my work. Bill, isn't that the native cemetery that Orchid was telling me about? That's where they buried Kimo. Oh, the one Mrs. Kilgore saw murdered. The one with the knife in his heart. His grave should be somewhere over there. - I'd like to see it. - Hmm? - Oh, it's taboo territory? - Un huh. Well, who's afraid of the local medicine man? Strange. An odd looking stump. Seems to be breaking the ground round the grave. Could it be a growth from the roots of another tree? I don't know. We better get Clark out here to look at it. He's an expert on jungle trees and plants. Well, it isn't very likely that a tree or the stump of one would sprout out of a grave. It'd have to penetrate a six foot coffin. Orchid says Kimo was buried in a six foot coffin. Could a tree trunk grow out of a coffin? Who knows? Science doesn't have all the answers, yet. It's probably the malformed growth of a tropical bush. Nothing particularly unusual about that. Professor, that's not a bush! No, it's a tree all right. Don't tell me that matured stumps come ready made from the ground. The next thing you know... Hello, Nargu. Nargu, what is it? Kimo's curse has come through. His spirit returns from the grave! - You mean this? - Yes. Nargu, I thought you didn't believe in that witch doctor hocus pocus. I have heard of stories like this from my grandfather who was storyteller of the tribe. Oh, you mean it's a legend, a made up story? No! No, it's the truth. Years ago, one of our great chiefs was murdered by his enemies. He was buried with seeds. He came back to life as a tree monster. Tree monster! Oh, now Norgu, I know about cannibalistic flowers, but this tree monster is utterly unbelievable. Dr. Mason, you are wise lady, but there are many things even the wisest of us do not know. This tree monster was torn loose from the ground by a bolt of lightning. It roamed the island. Killed many people. They called it... Tabanga! Tabanga, what does that mean? - Creature of revenge. - What happened to this monster? It just disappeared one day, never came back. Some say it walked into the quicksand at the edge of the forest. No one knew for sure. I just came from Mrs. Kilgore, by way of the cemetery. I happened to pass Kimo's grave. There's a strange growth from the ground. It has a ceremonial dagger in it's heart. See, Kimo's coming back! It looks so terrible, with green stuff coming from it. Like green blood from a dying man. Well, obviously there's something there. We'd better go and investigate it. You're right, Howard. There is an irregular heart beat Terry, give me the reading. This tallies with the lateral pulse. It's a human heart beat! What do you make of that green ooze? Probably the equivalent of blood, the stuff that keeps it alive. Let's take a sample. Stand back! Geiger reading gets high, ...on 65! Radioactive material in this thing! The Tabanga will soon remove itself from the ground. You mean this wooden zombie's going to uproot itself from the earth? Your grandfather must have been quite a storyteller. Please Professor, if this one is like the other Tabanga, you must destroy it at once. I beg you, pull up the roots so it will die before it murders everyone. Maybe you could throw it into the quicksand at the edge of the forest. Norgu, what you fear is scientifically impossible. You know what, I have an eerie feeling that this thing knows what we're saying. Professor, this is the reply from your message to Washington. "Request you remove growth." "Make thorough laboratory analysis." "Have Arnold and Mason determine influence of radiation, if any." "Radio detailed report." "Mail photos as soon as possible." "Falkner" Well, that's that. Better get busy. Thank you, Eddie. Well, the first thing to do is go out and dig up the monster, and bring it to the lab. That won't be easy. The roots probably go quite deep. Yeah, we'll probably have to separate each root at soil level and seal it with stitches. I imagine the natives are in an uproar. Like Nargu, they probably feel the monster is another Tabanga. If moving that monster violates another tribal law, we'll be in for it. You know we're greatly outnumbered here. They could easily overpower us. And don't forget what Nargu said about it being taboo for strangers to go near the Tabanga. Well, I say let's get started. And I say let's throw it in the quicksand. Forget about it. Well, they blame us for everything as it is. This could be the final straw. Where's your scientific curiosity, Doctor? Anyway, Washington wants us to investigate it, so let's take a risk and see what happens. Professor, Bill is worried about me. Now look, Bill. I can handle a gun if the occasion arises. Remember, we're both working for the Foundation. Well, I see I'm out voted. All right, if you people feel like chopping wood, I don't mind a little exercise. Let's go get the choppers. Nargu has disobeyed the taboo at the Americans. He must die with them. Nargu has many friends in the tribe. - We must be careful. - I say he must die. In good time. First... I will spread this powerful medicine at the base of the new Tabanga. It will go to the roots... Tabanga will become my servant and will kill when I tell it to! Nargu will be it's victim! I will place the medicine on the Tabanga. The 4th day after 2 full moons... so has the spirit told me. You'll remember, Tano, Korey must also die. Nargu, isn't this Korey, the wife of your dead friend, Kimo? You are Chief Maranka's woman. What do you come here for? He no longer loves me. He would take Naomi to be his wife. Korey, are you trying to tell us something? Yes, Tano and Maranka are planning to kill all of you. Also Nargu. You're breaking the Chief's taboo by coming here, isn't that true? [Korey] I know it. - And yet you came here to warn us? - Yes. How do we know this isn't some kind of trick? You do not trust me. I don't blame you. Did Nargu tell you I betrayed Kimo and caused his death? No, Nargu said nothing about that. They are evil, Tano and Maranka, both of them. They want to become gods of the island. That is why they want to drive you out, and all others who stand in their way. - Are you in their way, as we are? - Yes They want to kill me, too. Please let me stay here with you. You think we can trust her, Nargu? You can trust Korey. Even though she lied once, I think now she tells the truth. All right, you can stay here with Orchid. You'd better get Dori and stay in the compound too. Monster must be uprooted and brought here tonight. Make as little noise as possible. We don't want to alert the natives. Bill, you dig there. Terry, you and I will sever the roots as he exposes them. Hold the light, will you, Eddie? Pulse beat is almost human. Maybe we ought to ship it back to the States. Makes a great scarecrow. He reminds me of a chemistry prof I had at med school. Bill, during the operation, your arm accidentally brushed the knife in it's heart. - Ah, I didn't notice. - I could have sworn it moved. Almost as if it were in pain. The pulse is weak. It's dying! The pulse is getting weaker! It's dying on us! Probably a stoppage in the circulation somewhere. Maybe a clot in the aorta. Well, we've done everything we can. There's nothing more we can do. Looks as if it will stop beating altogether in a few minutes. Good! I'm all for throwing it in the quicksand. Let it return to it's ancestors. Couldn't we try to energize the adrenal gland with an electrode resistor? How much energy would you need? I've read of experiments where they used 750 amps and a 1,000 volts. Our generators can't give us that much power. Look, why keep this freak of nature alive? Your interest in it is morbid! Bill, it's purely scientific! And if you weren't so concerned with your natives, and their silly taboos, you'd be helping us. Not standing by doing nothing. I know what, why don't we psychoanalyze the monster? Maybe it's mother was scared by an oak tree. Oh, Bill. Why won't you be serious. Look, Terry... we came down here to treat people with the plague and those maybe suffering from atomic fallout. I'm no tree surgeon. Does this mean you two geniuses can't figure out the answer? Oh, I've got the answer. Let's pack our frozen faced friend in a box and send it back to Dr. Falkner. Maybe he can use it in his office as a clothes tree. Case closed! You two may consider this case closed, but this is an entirely new specie of life, and as long as there's life in it, I'm going to work on it. Formula 447? Is this something you've been working on at Baku? I've experimented with monkeys and parrots who've been exposed to a dangerous amount of radiation. This formula has achieved miraculous results in re-creating heart action. Have you experimented with human beings? Afraid I'm years away from that phase of the work, Bill. Works very slowly. Takes several hours to show any effect. I want to try some on our wooden friend here. I have a few hundred cc's right with me. What do you think, Bill? Well, the monsters almost dead. Terry wants to waste her time on it, it's all right with me. Thanks. Will you help me with an intravenous injection? You've never experimented with anything this large before, would you like to check your calculations? There isn't time, the thing's dying. We have to trust my calculations. It's now or never. All right, all right. We'll do it just the way you want. Thank you, Dr. Arnold. Now, will you hook up the IV bottle while I mix the formula? I will be delighted. Pulse is the same, no stronger, no weaker. - Bottles almost empty. - Want me to take the tube out? Yes, thanks, Bill. What do we do now, Terry, sit up with the dying patient? No, I don't think that'll be necessary. My experiments show it requires at least 8 hours for the formula to take affect. Might as well all get a good night's sleep and meet here at six o'clock in the morning. - That I heartily approve of. - Six o'clock! - The monster! - It's gone! You must have administered too large an injection of your formula. Came back to life sooner than you expected. The reaction never took less than 8 hours. I was so sure I figured correctly. Well, you figured wrong this time, in spades. Wait a minute, doctors. You honestly believe that Terry's formula brought the thing back to life and it ran away? I don't know... Terry, when you re-created heart action in those monkeys, did they suddenly have the strength of gorillas, tear the place apart? No, it took days or weeks before they had strength to run around. Well then, isn't it obvious who caused this destruction? You mean, Tano and the other natives? You think they came to get the Tabanga? I'm afraid so. And then after they were here, like angry children, they decided to smash our things. I guess you're right, Professor. Holy mackerel! You know, I know this sounds crazy, but maybe the Tabanga is for real. And if it is, we're gonna need help. Eddie, radio Baku. Doc! Professor! Does this mean we're cut off from communication from the outside? You've been hiding from me a long time. I've been waiting for this chance. You've stolen my man, now you must die! Help! Help me! The Tabanga! Help meg Help! Help meg Help! I just saw the Tabanga! Well, how do you know it was Tabanga? Because it looked like a tree, it had eyes and hands and a knife was still in it's heart, like Kimo's. - You have many loves. - I'm only calming her fright. She said she had seen the Tabanga. - Where did you see it? - In the forest, near the quicksand. - You sure it was the Tabanga? - I swear it! We'll soon find out. We will go to the cemetery! This is dangerous. The Tabanga's been taken out. It was the Americans! They cut the roots to free the Tabanga! - It will kill us all! - Not if we kill it first. We'll have our bravest men hunt it down and kill it! As long as the Tabanga's free, we are all in danger. After the Tabanga dies, then the Americans die! Come, take me to where you saw the Tabanga. Korey's gone! This is where I left her! See, there's her knife! See, this is Korey's too! Tabanga must have thrown Korey in the quicksand. We must find the Tabanga! - Where's Maranka? - Killed, by the Tabanga. Tano, why didn't you destroy the Tabanga with medicine? Before I could get to it, the Americans had cut the roots and given it freedom. Now the evil spirits in the Tabanga are too strong, it must be killed! Hurry, we have no time to waste! Orchid, what's wrong? I just came from the village. The Tabanga is not dead. That can't be! Tabanga came to the village and killed Maranka. Does anybody know where the Tabanga is now? Tano and his men are looking for it. What is it? The monster's still alive. I knew my formula would work. I was right, Professor, wasn't I? Yes, but I'm not sure how right I was to let you go ahead with it. Orchid reports the Tabanga's killed the chief. Oh no, I... I just wanted it to live. Not to destroy. Don't blame yourself, Terry. The radiation dormant in the monster must have set off a chain reaction. We've got to stop that monster before there's any more killing! Isn't it strange, that of all the natives on the island, the monster got Maranka? Tabanga spirit of revenge. It killed Korey, Kimo's widow. We've got to help these people. It is dangerous for you to go. Tano blames you for taking the Tabanga from the ground. Orchid's right. With the Tabanga running amok, they'll kill anything in sight. - Are the guns loaded? - Yeah. Kani, we've set our trap well. Now we must be certain the Tabanga will fall into this pit. We know the Tabanga has threatened three lives, Korey's, Maranka's, and mine. So I am the next one he would kill! Therefore, I'm the bait that must lead him to the trap! Maku, climb a tree, signal me when you see it coming. I'll stand here. The rest of you, stand behind the trees! Tabanga comes! Tabanga comes! Now! Tabanga will die. [knocking] Wait a minute, Doc. This may be trouble. Eddie! See who's at the door. Be ready to shoot. Yes, sir. Well, what do you want? Come quick, please help us. We can not kill the Tabanga. We burned Tabanga with a mighty fire, but it didn't help. It came out alive! Please come before it kills us all! Do you know where the Tabanga is now? Good. You two wait outside. Thank heavens all of you are alive. I thought I'd never see you again. When Orchid told me about that horrible monster running amok, I didn't dare leave my house. An hour ago the natives ran past the house screaming and jabbering about the monster. They said it was on the prowl. You two girls stay here. It's safer. Oh, no. I'm going with you. I won't stay here alone for minute with you men gone. What if that horrible thing came back. She's right. Obviously, locked doors mean nothing to the monster. Well, I can't keep you back if you insist on tagging along. Bring a gun for me, Eddie. I don't know how to shoot one of the bloomin' things, but I'd feel safer with one also. Make it two, Eddie. Eddie, we should be able to pick up the trail if we can find any of that green ooze. I'll keep my eyes open, Doc. [Mrs. Kilgore chattering] [Mrs. Kilgore] And I've looked for that green goop everywhere, everywhere I can think, and I haven't seen a sign of it. I never would have thought of such a thing from Kimo. Delightful fellow, really. I know that you like the Doc, Deary, but I had a real liking for that Kimo, and I had a thing going once. Of course, he was much taller than I, but there's something about a tall man that I, well I don't know, you look up at him and he looks down at you, and I don't know, you just go on like that indefinitely. Deary, island life is very pleasant, but there's nothing like a good pub. There you sit with a gentleman every evening, drinking... Help! Help! Help! Help! - What was that? - It came from behind us. [screams] Where's Terry? I don't know. I was talking to her and all of a sudden, poof, she disappeared. You think that bloomin' monster got hold of her? - We've got to find her. - Let's go back. Come on! [woman screams] Down there! It's Terry! You're the best shot, Eddie. Have you got enough light to see? This moonlight's good enough. All right. Try for that knife. Maybe if you can hit that knife with the bullet it'll drive it clear through the monster's heart. It has to turn to give me a crack at that knife, Doc. Fire a few shots, maybe it'll turn around. No effect on it at all. - Try again. - I'll aim above her. Doc, I never saw anything like this. Those bullets bounce off like BB shot on a stone wall. That knife's our only chance. Now! We know now, American magic is better. Maybe we need new medicine maker to replace Tano. Will you be our witch doctor? Maybe for a little while, Maku. Then perhaps we can teach some of your people. Thank you. Oh, Professor Clark, that was ever so thrilling. And isn't nice you and the natives can be friends again. Yes, it looks like a honeymoon and back to the States for them. Ah, by the way, Professor, I never asked you, are you married?
