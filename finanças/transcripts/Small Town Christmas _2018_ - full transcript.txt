"... And as she walked down the brightly-decorated streets of Derryville, Amanda finally felt at home. Peaceful, harmonious, and a place where everyone knows each other's business, good or bad, and where you can't walk past anyone without stopping to say hello, Derryville was the home she had always been searching for. Looking around, Amanda realized Derryville was at its peak during the Christmas season. She smiled with excitement, knowing she would be there for the annual holiday festival. But this year would be different. This year, she would look forward to so much more than Christmas trees and opening presents, because, this year, she would open her heart to love". And that's chapter 12 of "Small Town Christmas". Thank you all for coming. Ladies and Gentlemen, Nell Phillips! If you'd like to stick around, Ms. Phillips will be signing copies of her book. They make great Christmas gifts! Thank you so much for doing this. Of course. I love meeting everyone. I love your book so much. Don't you wish a place like Derryville actually existed? All right, Santa Claus, I promised I'd donate next time I saw you. I made good on it. Merry Christmas! Oh! Ester! You don't want to lose your star. Merry Christmas! Steve! Hey! Merry Christmas! Are you going to go finally fix the pothole? I am hoping for a Christmas miracle. Third time's a charm. Go get it. Here's hoping. - Merry Christmas, buddy. - Thanks! I'm sorry! Goodness, Emmett! Hi! Would you like a ginger snap? I made those fresh. Running into you is the sweetest part of my day. Merry Christmas. Mrs. Ferguson. All right, one more! By the way, Norma's granddaughter was asking about you again. I was wondering, would you mind if I give her your telephone number? I'm sorry, Mrs. Ferguson, I can't hear you. The cookies... they're too delicious. Merry Christmas! There you go. Thank you so much. Merry Christmas! Thank you very much. Some extra fuel. Thank you, Caroline. I have to admit, I'm glad this tour is finally over. No, no, no, no. Not until you tape the "Hello Chicago" interview today. Then you can take a nice long holiday break... and start the sequel. You don't stop, do you? And that's why you signed with me. Well, you got me there. Hey, Brad. Is that report on Springdale ready for me to take a look at? It sure is. All right. Let's see what you've got. Research doesn't lie. Springdale is America's best-kept Christmas secret. It is the perfect candidate to be revitalized. Now, I think if we act quickly, we could turn it into next year's hottest holiday destination spot. We'll have all the luxuries of a big city, without losing that small-town Christmas spirit. We could be looking at an exponential return on our investment. Just like you did in Wallisport. I've got to say, Brad, this is all looking very promising. Thank you. You know, for a moment there, I was worried that you were dragging us there for nothing. I know, I know, it's close to Christmas, but trust me on this, Lance, being there in person is the only way to see Springdale's full potential. I mean, it is... it's utterly charming. I'm looking forward to it. Me too. Welcome back to "Hello Chicago" with Ricki. How does it feel to see your debut novel do so well, so quickly? As a writer, even I don't have the words for it. The town you paint is so rich. Is it based on your own hometown? Actually, no. We moved around a lot when I was a kid because of my parents' work. I've never told anyone this, but Derryville is actually based on a town called Springdale. It's in Wisconsin. I see. You must have taken trips there then? Believe it or not, I have never been to Springdale. An old co-worker of mine grew up there and he used to tell me stories about it. It sounded so idyllic, I felt inspired to set the book in a town just like it. That's incredible. How does your co-worker feel about the book? I don't know. We've lost touch. Look up bookstores in Springdale, Wisconsin. All right, kiddo. Look, I got a little brain food for you. Why don't you take a break? Do you think I'm getting everything right? Well, let me take a look here, Peanut. I think that your math homework is starting to look like a foreign language to me. Besides, you know, your teacher said that you're way ahead of your classmates. She said that you stay inside during recess so that you can finish extra work. How else am I going to stay ahead? Sweetheart, you don't have to be ahead of anything or anyone. You're perfect just the way that you are. Besides, you're 9 years old and it's Christmas break. You need to live a little. Hang on. PaigeTurner Books, this is Emmett speaking. Hello. This is Caroline Lucas. I would like to speak to someone about scheduling a book signing event. Well, you are speaking to the right someone. Great, it's for an author by the name of Nell Phillips. I'm sorry, did you say Nell Phillips? So how come you never mentioned Springdale before? Because I have a terrific idea! I am sending you there for one last stop on the tour! No. No, no. I've got to get home to New York. Think of all the positive press the book will get. "Best-selling author finally visits real-life inspiration". Please, I would really rather not. I'm sorry, Nell, it's all set. I spoke to the bookstore and they've arranged some local events for you to attend. And guess what? This is all a joke? You know that co-worker that you mentioned in your interview? The one in your acknowledgements? Well, it turns out that he runs the bookstore! You know, I think that my phone call kind of surprised him. Emmett? You spoke to Emmett Turner? And he seemed very excited that you wanted to come and visit Springdale. Only I don't want to visit Springdale. Book club potluck chicken, check. Hayley, why don't you sit down and give yourself a rest? I'm fine! You sound just like Steve. He's a wise man. Ooh, speaking of Steve, I need him to build me a podium for the Kringlefest stage. Yes, thank you! That might actually make him stop building cribs. He's obsessed with getting this new nursery done. Well, do you blame him? I mean, you only get to celebrate your first child once, right? That's true. Also, I really do need you to order me some more of those "how to" titles, because we only have one more month to go and we have a lot to learn. Well, you know what, it's on the list, so consider it done. Thank you. Mayor Deakins. - Hey, Emmett. - How are you? Good. Sorry I'm late. The budget meeting ran long. Don't even think about it. Look it, I made a Kringlefest list. Here's what I think. I think that we should do the Secret Santa selections before we do the tree lighting, and I've talked to the potluck folks. They're starting to cook already. Sounds good to me. You know, you really keep a good handle on all of this. I can't believe you still don't use a tablet. They really are handy. You know how Emmett is with technology. Look, I just feel like there's something more substantial about paper and pen. Can I get you something, Mayor? Sure. I'll grab a coffee, thanks. Okay. Hey, do you have any of that... almond milk? I was talking to my niece the other day and she says it's so much better for you. I didn't know you could milk an almond. Hayley, did you know you could milk an almond? I had no idea. We didn't know that, we don't have any... but next time, we'll get you some. Okay, so besides the tree lighting, what else is on the agenda? We have the same as always... the gingerbread contest, and caroling, of course... Actually, this year, we've got something a little different. I've got a surprise for Springdale. A special guest speaker. Well, I hope it doesn't cost anything after what I heard at the budget meeting today. Things are not looking good. Yeah, Steve said that the hardware store hasn't been as busy either. Okay, well, hang on. Don't be so gloomy, guys. It's not going to cost anything, and, in fact, it might bring in some business. Okay? So, who's this... Nell Phillips. She's coming for a reading and a book signing for Kringlefest. "Small Town Christmas" is my favorite book right now. Wait, this is the one we're doing for book club. That's right, Mayor. And funny thing, you know what, I actually... I used to work with her in New York City. No kidding. This is amazing! Well done, Emmett. Nell Phillips. Here! I mean, you must be thrilled. I'm... I'm... I am. Nell Phillips. "Small Town Christmas". "Dedicated to my parents. Special thanks to Caroline Shaw... " "Emmett". Good morning! Don't look so grim. It's just a quick trip. Are you sure this is really necessary? Isn't the book doing well enough? Yes, but we have to keep up the momentum. Plus, seeing the town may give you that extra inspiration for the sequel you're supposed to be working on. I get inspiration from everywhere. Do you really? Because you've given me a grand total of zero pages so far. You know, I really think that this trip will be helpful. Okay, I'm fine with the trip, but why does Emmett have to be involved? Okay... what's this really about? It's just... Back when Emmett and I used to work together, we had this connection. Or at least I thought we did. And then? And then, one night, we were supposed to meet for dinner. He told me he had this amazing night planned. We were celebrating because a story we wrote together was moved into development. What happened? He didn't show up. I waited for two hours in that restaurant, alone. He didn't call, he didn't text. Nothing. The next day, my boss told me that he'd quit abruptly and packed up all his stuff. You didn't try to contact him? I sent him a few text messages. But he never responded. And that's it? He just disappeared. It was a sign to move on. A few years ago, I tried to look him up on social media, but... nothing. End of story. You know you say that so much, they're gonna put it on your tombstone. Here lies Nell Phillips, "End of Story". This time, it's true, though. He was the first guy I really opened up to. About my parents... and everything. And as soon as I opened up, he shut it all down. I'm not going to let that happen again. It sounds more like "To be continued". "The sleepy town of Derryville roars to life during the holiday season as if compelled by the magic of Christmas itself". Of course, this book is based on Springdale. No wonder I love this book so much. She definitely did this town justice. Sure did. You must be excited to see her after all these years. I am. I'm not, you know, so sure she's going to be excited to see me. Why? What happened? It was a long time ago. Come on, spill it. All right, all right. Well, we worked together. We'd gotten close, you know? So I had this big dinner planned. It was kind of a first date. And then, you know, everything happened, and I came back here. Which is the best decision I ever made. So I just landed in the middle of nowhere, in Wisconsin. This is the smallest airport I've ever seen. Well, buckle up, because you are still a few hours from Springdale. It was too far away for a car service, so I reserved you a rental. Perfect. Call me when you get settled in. I need to hear how the reunion goes. And I will see you back in New York for Christmas. I'll bring you some of their famous ginger snaps. If they're as good as you described in the book, bring a couple dozen. And when you're not busy eating award-winning baked goods, maybe get me some new pages? Don't push your luck. Okay. Bye. Here are your keys. Do you need any directions today? No thanks. My phone should get me there. Okay, you're all set. Great. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Hi. I'm so sorry, I don't have a reservation, but I'll take whatever you've got. I'm afraid I just rented out the last one. Seriously? It's the holidays, our busiest season. - Where are you off to? - Springdale. The cabs won't go that far, but I can check the bus schedule. Yeah, that would be great. Thank you. The last bus to Springdale already left. There's one tomorrow afternoon, though. No, I really need to get there tonight. I've got an important meeting tomorrow morning. Is there anyone in town that can maybe take me? I'll pay whatever it takes. Come on, Sandra. It's... it's Christmas. I'm so sorry. I don't... Excuse me. Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear. I'm Nell. I'm Brad. I believe we're going to the same place. I'd be happy to share my rental car. Really? That... that would be amazing. Are you sure you're comfortable with that? I mean, I can help cover the cost, of course. That won't be necessary. But I will need your help with directions? I would be honored to be your navigator. Thank you so much. Thank you. May I? Thanks. Sorry, I had to fire off a quick email. I'm helping a friend with a new business plan. You're a finance guy? Guilty. I work for a venture capital firm. That's actually why I'm on this trip. I think I can put this town on the map. I want to turn it into a popular tourist destination. And you think Springdale fits the bill? I know it does. I spent several Christmases there when I was a kid. I still remember all the fun holiday activities. So you've already experienced a true Springdale Christmas. I have. I'm so jealous. I'm actually really excited to be going again. Hi, Caroline. You're on speaker and I'm not alone, so don't say anything to embarrass me. Okay. I already sent you an email, but I wanted to give you the head's up on your itinerary. You have a book signing, then a local radio spot, and then book club. And last but not least, I signed you up for the gingerbread contest. Of course you did. And there'll be a photographer there to cover everything. If you forget anything, Emmett's got all the information. Emmett. Yes. Sounds good. I'll call you later. Okay. Have fun. - Bye. - Bye. Whoa. I did not know I was in the presence of a bona fide celebrity. Okay! Tell me about this book of yours. Well, it's about a career-driven woman who gets stranded in a small town over the holidays. And she may or may not find love. Whoa! Don't leave me hanging. No, you have to buy the book and read it. Okay. Done deal. I'm in. So, this gingerbread contest... which I can tell you're very excited about? Yeah. Do you need a partner? Only if you intend to win! I do. For sure. Okay. Looks like we're almost there. Okay, what are you most excited about for your first Kringlefest? Whoa! What was that? That was a pothole. This town has a whole lot of them. Looks like I need to add street repairs to my list. Okay, so it looks like we're coming up to my stop. Where do you want me to drop you off? I'm at the Springdale Inn. Really? That's where I'm staying. Don't be too surprised, neighbor. It is the only hotel in town. Something else I intend to fix. Well, this is adorable. I'll just go ahead and grab the bags real quick. - I'll drop them off inside. - Yeah. Nell! Emmett. Hi. Hi, Nell. Welcome to Springdale. I didn't know you were going to be here when I arrived. I was just passing by. It's good to see you again. It's good to see you, too. You look exactly like I remember. - You look good. - Thank you. - So do you. - Thanks. So what have you been... You go first. How was your trip? I'm shocked that you're standing here. Well, it wasn't my idea. But it's great to finally see Springdale. I should really thank you for setting everything up. No, it was easy. It was no trouble at all. People are so impressed that I get to say I knew you when. - That you did. - Yeah. Hey, Nell, don't lock the... - Hey. - Hi. How's it going? I'm Brad Hathaway. Well, hi, Brad. I'm Emmett Turner. Right. You own the book store. That? Yeah, I do. Yeah. I'm just going to get my bag real quick. Yeah. Okay, well, what I want to do is give you the grand tour of Springdale, but I'm sure you're beat, so get some sleep, and then in the morning, if you have time, we'll do that. - Sure. - Okay. I'll call the bookstore when I'm ready. Great. That's where I'll be. Brad! Great to meet you. Welcome to Springdale. Nell, we're so excited to have you here. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. This place is beautiful. It's gorgeous. I hope they have wifi. I wonder where the host is. - Those are cute. - Aren't they sweet? The local kids make a new set each year and we display them all over town. You know, I remember making those when I was a kid. That's amazing. The only stockings I ever had were from a department store. These have so much more character. I'm Scott. You must be Ms. Phillips and Mr. Hathaway? Yes. You're the last two guests to arrive. Let me get the keys to your rooms. Perfect. Hey, thank you again for the ride. And I really enjoyed the company. Of course. If you're not busy tomorrow morning, you're more than welcome to join me on the tour. I'd love to, but I actually have a meeting with the mayor. But there's a tree-lighting ceremony tomorrow night. Would you care to join me? I'd love to. - Great. - Great. I can't believe that you're here after all these years. Yeah, it's funny it all worked out. Hey, do you keep in touch with the old gang? I'd love to hear how they're doing. A bunch of us got together for Thanksgiving a few years ago, but it's been a while. Well, I should reach out and wish them happy holidays. Seeing you will be an excuse to re-connect. Sure. Good idea. All right. Well, here it is. This is the Main Street. This is where it all happens, as they say. Now, this, right here, this is the Silver Moon Diner. If you're hungry for breakfast, it's the best you're ever going to eat. Right across the street, we have the original movie theatre built in 1949, and there, at the end of the street, is PaigeTurner Books. That's my store. So you came back here to open a store? It's been in the family for years. I did start the book club, though. Which is the last event on my trip? Yep. Yep. I have to admit, I thought you were exaggerating when you described this place. No. Not at all. No. There is no place in the world that celebrates Christmas quite like Springdale. I saw the kids' stockings earlier. So you really don't think that I'm going to need that replacement part? Now, this is Mrs. Ferguson and Steve. ...Why that dishwasher just suddenly started working again. Look, I promise you, you are not going to run into another problem. Steve, if I find out that you came over there and fixed it secretly without sending me a bill... All right, hold on a second. Before you get too mad at him, you know he can't help himself, right? Hi! Who's your friend? Nell Phillips, this is Mrs. Ferguson. Now, don't tell Mayor Deakins, but Mrs. Ferguson is the one who actually runs things around here. And this is Steve. He runs the hardware store. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Ferguson. Steve. The pleasure is mine. Our book club is going to be very happy to meet you. If you have the time, please, drop over for tea. If I can, it would be an honor. All right, I'm going to take Nell to go see the bookstore. All right. - See you later. - Bye-bye. That means you're probably going to run into my wife, Hayley, and fair warning... she's gonna ask you a whole lot of questions. I'll prepare myself. Seriously. - Bye, Steve. - See ya. You know, I want to say how much I enjoyed your book, I mean, how much everybody has enjoyed your book. You took a few snippets of this town that I told you, and you created something really wonderful. I'm proud of you. Well, thank you. And, you know, I saw you put my name there in the special acknowledgements. That was... you didn't have to do that. I was flattered. It's customary to thank the people that provided inspiration or feedback on a work. It's pretty standard. Well... other than writing a best-selling novel, what have you been doing these past six years? Mostly working. After a few dead ends, someone finally responded to "Small Town Christmas," and, well... End of story. Yeah. We're here. You ready? Mayor Deakins, thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me. I have to say, I was very intrigued by your email. Tell me more about this revitalization idea of yours. It's very simple. I plan to fund upgraded infrastructure, technology, and building improvements. Now, I also want to purchase existing buildings, some to fix up, and others to re-purpose. Now, you honestly believe you can transform Springdale into a viable vacation spot? Kringlefest and Springdale is absolutely the world's best-kept holiday secret. But it's not going to be long until the whole world is knocking at your door. This place, it has potential for huge success, so as long as you can handle the number of tourists that are sure to come your way. That's where I come in. These are some of the plans that I have in mind. Here it is. You couldn't have just stuck with the basics, huh? Fiction. Non-fiction. I think that it's a very successful system. It was one of the innovations I implemented when I took this place over. Well, it's the only innovation. I just hope my book doesn't end up with the "One Hit Wonders". Highly unlikely. In fact, I created a section especially for you. Come here. Where is it? Here, here. "Heartfelt Christmas with a Strong Female Heroine". Okay. Looks like I should get cracking on that sequel. And I wanted you to have a proper Springdale welcome with an absurdly large sign. Well... Emmett, this store is incredible, but are you still writing? - Well... - Hey, boss! I didn't know you were coming in. Ms. Phillips! Nell, this is Hayley, my favorite employee. His only employee, but I'll take it. Hi. Hi, Hayley, very nice to meet you. We ran into your husband earlier today, and, please, call me Nell. Okay, thank you! Springdale? Is it everything you thought it would be or is it totally different? And do you have a big agenda while you're in town? Can I get you a coffee or something? You were warned. It's been incredible so far. Even better than I imagined. Just a few official stops for the book tour and then it's back home to New York. And, yes, a coffee sounds perfect. Yes! Okay! I've... I've always wanted to travel and visit New York. It just seems so exciting, but I haven't really ever made it out of state. Well, I've always wanted to visit Springdale. Maybe you can tell me some more stories. I need some fodder for the sequel. You might be able to help with my writer's block. I'm sorry, I just... I can't believe that Emmett is friends with a best-selling author. Acquaintances, really, but, yeah, we go way back. One sugar, no cream. - Thanks. Thank you. - Yeah. Well, I should get back. I've got some work to catch up on. But I'll see you tonight? Yes, you will. - Very nice to meet you, Hayley. - Thank you. Bye-bye. She's great! Yeah. How are they selling? Oh, my goodness, they're selling like hotcakes. I'm moving her to the prime spot. Where's Marnie? I was going to take her to the ice rink. Hayley took her Christmas shopping. You know, I don't know what I would do without you two ladies. I appreciate you. You know we'd do anything for that girl. I know. Hey, what was it like seeing Nell again. I don't know. It was different. You know, she... She used to have more of a sense of humor. Maybe she's just shy because you haven't seen each other in so long. Could be. But she completely ignored the letter I sent her. Letter? Like an actual letter in the mail? Why didn't you call her? I don't know. You know how hard it was for me back then. I didn't know what to say. She texted me a few times, but... I should have responded, but I ignored her, and... - You were overwhelmed. - Yeah. I wanted to focus on Marnie and I wanted to make sure she was okay. I still don't get how this letter fits in. Okay, I wrote her a letter months after. I just wanted to apologize and tell her about Paige, and I wanted to put all my thoughts down at once, and then I mailed it to the office we used to work at. - She didn't reply? - No. No, and I guess she's moved on and that's fine. Emm, I'm sorry. That's okay, you know? I guess she's just... from a different time in my life. But when I heard she was coming back here, I got my hopes up. I thought maybe we could be friends. I've missed her. So I know I'm supposed to be working on the sequel, but I just ran into the coolest toy store. What are your kids into these days? They will be fine with whatever you pick out. Now stop deflecting and tell me how it went seeing Emmett again. I am not deflecting! Emmett's fine. He knows all the details for my trip. But did you ask him about standing you up? He's acting like it never happened, so I am, too. You're seriously not going to mention anything? I seriously don't see the point. Obviously, the time we spent together meant more to me than it did to him. I'll call you after the book signing and let you know how it goes. - Bye! - Bye. I'm so sorry! That's okay. You can't break the stuffing. That's true. I'm Marnie. I'm Nell. Are you the one who wrote the book about Springdale? That's me. It's very nice to meet you, Marnie. I'm going to read it while I'm on winter break. I can do a book report on it if you want! That's so sweet! Like for school? Just for practice. What are you practicing for? College. College? Marnie, I just found the cutest little... Hi! Nell! Hi! Hi, Hayley. Is she yours? Oh, no, I'm just watching this little cutie for Emmett. Emmett? Okay. But it is good practice for me. I'm sure. Are we going to see you at the tree lighting? Yeah! That's tonight! I almost forgot about that. Thank you for reminding me. I'm just on my way back to the hotel to bundle up. Okay. Well, we will see you there, then. See you there! Race you to the register. Bye. I just saw the stage that you built, Steve. Amazing job, as always. Thank you. I do what I can, you know? Nell! Hope you're enjoying Springdale! Thanks, Steve. Hiya, Nell. Well, you're certainly getting an insider's peek behind the scenes, huh? I sure am. It seems like you have a very fulfilled life here. Yeah, well, it's not perfect, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. You're very lucky you spent your childhood in a place like this. My parents never slowed down long enough to celebrate our own traditions, and after my mom passed, we started celebrating even less. I'm sorry. I remember you telling me how your dad passed away shortly after that, so Christmases must be hard for you. I think that's why your Christmas stories stood out the most in my mind. And I'm surprised you remember that about my parents. I remember everything about you. About us. Our time together. Here's what I do know. I know that your mom and dad would be very proud of you, and... all the success you're having. I know I am. Hey, are you going to join us for the Christmas tree lighting tonight? Yeah. I should get going, 'cause I told Brad I would meet him before. Brad? Right, Brad. How... how is Brad? He's good. Yeah? Yeah, he's a nice guy. - See you there. - Bye now. Brad... So... how are you liking Springdale so far? It's surreal being here after picturing it for so long. It's magical. It's so unique. I know. And I don't want to interfere with any of that. I just... I just want to spruce things up a bit, that's all. Being here makes me want to start my own Christmas tradition. Who knows? We could be starting one right now. Watch out for that ice. We can't have the guest of honor showing up injured! You look terrific, by the way. Thank you. Hi! Welcome to Kringlefest. Hey, so how does this stage compare to other venues? Well, I've never had a stage quite like this. Springdale might not be a big town, but we make up for it with enthusiasm. I'm sorry, I've got to take this call real quick. I'll be right back. - Okay. - Hello? So I hope it's okay I cleared off a little space right here for the reporter to take pictures of you. If that's all right? Well, thank you, Emmett. That's very thoughtful. Happy Secret Santa night! Happy what? It's the night we all draw names, the start of Kringlefest. How do you know Nell? Marnie and I met at the toy shop today. We go way back. So how does it work? You pull a secret name out of Santa's bag and we all exchange gifts on Christmas Eve. You have to do it! I'll be back in New York by then. You could mail it. That'd be super secret. I'll feel bad, I'm not a local. Come on, it's so much fun! You know, it's pointless. You don't really want to argue with her. Well, okay. Why not? And then tomorrow, you can come over and decorate our tree with us! All right, hold on. Slow down, Pumpkin. She's got a full plate tomorrow. She's got a big, important radio interview. Okay, that big, important radio interview's only going to take an hour, but I don't want to impose on your family time. No, no, it's not an imposition. You want to come, we would love to have you if you want to come. Okay! I'll take that as a yes. Bye! - Jenny! - See? What did I tell you? I told you she's hard to say no to. Did she get that from you or did she get that from her mother? Paige. Paige? Like your sister, Paige? Yeah. Wait, so Marnie's not your daughter? No, no. Marnie is my wonderful, precocious, fiery niece. I thought we talked about that. Yeah... Yeah, I guess, but that was a long time ago. I mean, it's been years. Well, sure. So where are her parents? Her mom and dad died in a car accident when she was 3. I took custody right away. - I wrote all that in... - Come on, Uncle Emmett! I want to see the tree up close! That's why you left. Hey, what did I miss? Nothing. Just about to pick out my Secret Santa name. You're really getting into this. Okay... All right, everyone, let's gather around. We're about to begin. Come on up. Grab yourselves some hot chocolate and a treat. Get some hot cider. Welcome, everyone, to the start of another Kringlefest. Now, before I call upon our special guest, I have a few brief remarks. If everything goes as intended this week, Springdale will be receiving a much-appreciated and much-needed infusion of capital from Brad Hathaway and his investment group. As a token of their support, they have arranged to have this year's Christmas Eve potluck professionally catered. So you can all put away your Crock-Pots! By this time next year, we'll be hosting a brand-new holiday festival. All we're aiming to do is enhance our beloved traditions and look toward the future. Now, we've instituted some recommended guidelines for next year's storefront decorations. You can't just change tradition. That's why it's called "tradition"! Okay... Everyone, just bear with me, please. Everybody, calm down. Calm down. Calm down, everybody. Let's just listen to what next year's plans might be before we lodge complaints. Isn't that fair? We're here to light a Christmas tree tonight. We're here to celebrate and welcome our special guest to Springdale. In fact, why don't we let our special guest light the Christmas tree this year? Everybody, please give author Nell Phillips a warm Springdale welcome! You're going to flip a switch. I've never done anything like this before, but... here's to Kringlefest, past, present and future! Ready? Three, two, one... Thank you for that, by the way. I think that everyone's going to love my plan for Springdale once they just see my vision for it. It's going to be great. I hope so, Brad. Let me ask you this, have you ever thought about selling your bookstore? Because, from what I've heard, you should be writing books, not selling them. I've never... Just think about it. I'll think about it. All right, everybody. Nell is going to read a small excerpt from her new best-selling book, "Small Town Christmas," and then when she's done, if you want her to, she'll sign a copy. "One break-up had been enough. Amanda had locked her heart and thrown away the key, but as she connected to Derryville and the people within it, it was if the town itself was slowly picking the lock. When she imagined what kind of man could win her heart, she always thought of him... the one that got away. The one no one had ever measured up to... or ever could". Thank you so much. The entire town is in this line. Do you want me to help you make a break for it? I'm okay. I want to meet everyone who wants to meet me. - Hi. - You're the boss. Hey, kiddo. Are you getting sleepy? No. I want to stay till the end. Well, I think we've reached the end, baby. Let's get you home to sleep. Come on. Shouldn't we say goodbye to Nell first? No. She'll understand. Plus, we'll see Nell tomorrow. Come on, let's get you to sleep. Merry Christmas. Hi. Tuck Lady Bunnington in. All right, goodnight, kiddo. One more story before bed? Okay. Which one do you want me to read? Not one of those. I want an Uncle Emmett original. All right. Okay. All right. All right. Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, there was a little girl who could yawn for hours and never fall asleep. But one day, this little girl met a rabbit. And that's why he had to move so suddenly. I just wish he would have told me sooner. I could have done something to help. He walked away from his entire life to take care of his niece. He sounds like an amazing guy. No wonder you've been pining after him all this time. Pining? Who said I was pining? Anyway, it doesn't matter. He's focused on his niece right now and he doesn't see me the way he used to. End of story. Okay, fair enough. So... tell me about this Brad guy. Well, he's successful and witty. He's very passionate about his job, He really helped me out last night at the book signing, which was sweet. You sound like you have some options. Okay. Well, I have to get going, because my publisher booked an appearance on a small-town radio station. She sounds great at her job. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Hey there. You working here now? I'm on winter break. Uncle Emmett is making me earn my keep. Good for you. That's my mom. She's beautiful. You look just like her. Thanks. You know, my mom and dad passed away when I was young, too. And I carry their pictures with me everywhere I go. Like my own personal treasure. They look really nice. They were. I'm sure your parents were, too. Can I help you find anything? What do you like to read? My favorite stories aren't available for sale. Out of stock? Never in print. Uncle Emmett makes up the best bedtime stories. That doesn't surprise me. You know, he used to write the most incredible stories for me when we worked together. I'm surprised he doesn't have about a dozen books published by now. Really? Good, you're here. Hey, Steve called me last night and said the book-signing went really well. I'm glad everyone enjoyed it. Hey, kiddo, so Nell and I have an important meeting at the radio station. Do you want to come along with us or do you want to stay here with Hayley? I'll stay with Hayley. We'll be back. Tr ee o'clock. You're coming, too, right, Nell? How could I refuse a charmer like you? Thank you, Hayley. I'm Kevin LaGrange and you're listening to "Wake up, Springdale!" I'm pleased to welcome your favorite author, and mine, Nell Phillips. Thanks for having me, Kevin. I'm a straight shooter. Normally, a heartfelt story like this is not my cup of tea, but a friend said, "Give it 10 pages, Kevin, and if you don't like it, move on something else". But once I started, I couldn't put it down! I was up all night because I had to get through it. Well, I apologize for the lack of sleep. Totally worth it. Tell me, did you always know you had what it takes to be a writer? No, actually. When I first started, it was more as a hobby. I'd spend hours on it, but I still had a day job. But I got a lot of encouragement from an old friend. And... that gave me the confidence to share my work. Thank goodness you did. What do you hope your readers take away from this story? "Small Town Christmas" represents the sense of community everyone is looking for, whether they live in a big city or in a tiny village. It's that feeling of belonging, knowing that you have people there that will stand by you no matter what. You were really great in there. You're a natural. Thanks. You know, it's true what I said. You really did inspire me to get my work out there. I'm really flattered, Nell. I had no idea. What was it like for you? Moving back home? Well, gee... It was a huge adjustment, trading in big city for a quieter life. It was, you know... I can imagine. And on top of that, you became a guardian overnight. Well, that was definitely a challenge. You know, it's still a challenge. I'm just trying to do the best job that I can. You know, actually, my parents offered to take Marnie down to Florida with them. What made you decide to stay here? It didn't seem fair to Marnie to move her down there after her life had already changed so dramatically. And, well, Paige... Paige listed me as her guardian if anything were to happen to them, and I just wanted to honor that. You made a tremendous sacrifice for your family. That's what family does, Nell. I really admire you for how you handled things. Marnie is very lucky to have you. I am the lucky one. I hope you're ready for tree decorating, because Marnie takes this very seriously. She takes everything very seriously. I'll follow her lead. Just one small detail we need to take care of first. What detail? All right, here she is. Seriously? We have to cut this down ourselves? No, you have to cut it down. The guest of honor always cuts down the Christmas tree. That is a Springdale tradition. Pretty sure you just made that up. Nah. Nah. Come on. Get swinging, Miss Bunyan. I do yoga three times a week, but my axe-wielding skills are limited. Don't underestimate yourself. Is this even legal? We are on private land, but the owners are in Florida, so no biggie. Emmett! It's my parents property, I promise. It's fine. Get chopping. Can you do it? I really don't like killing trees. Oh, really? What do you think your books are made of? Please? All right, I'll tell you what, I'll make you a deal. I will cut down this tree if... if you read my work. You're still writing? Yeah. Here and there. I'm a little rusty and I think your notes would be helpful. Of course. Why didn't you say something earlier? Well, I was worried that you'd be too busy for me now that you're a big, famous writer and all. Never. I'm so happy to hear you didn't give up. Well... You're very talented. You know, I know that you say that I've inspired you, but you... you're a big inspiration to me. I might be your biggest fan. Is that so? Well, next to Marnie, of course. Speaking of, we shouldn't keep her waiting. That's all you. Come on. Sure you don't need help with that? Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! It's huge! It's going to be beautiful when it's all decorated. Now, I will see you three at the gingerbread contest. Bye-bye, Mrs. Ferguson. - Drive safe. - Bye, Mrs. Ferguson. This year, Uncle Emmett and I are taking first place! Not if I have anything to say about it. Really? Did you hear that? Look at the ornament Mrs. Ferguson and I made for the tree! Hold on a second. Are you telling me that you made that? No. There is no way. Do you think she made that? Definitely not. An ornament that beautiful had to have been bought at a super-fancy store. I'm telling you, Mrs. Ferguson taught me how to make them. Sweetheart, I believe you. It's beautiful. Of course, she did. We're going to set the tree up. Can I tell you a secret? Yeah. I got Uncle Emmett for Secret Santa, but I don't know what to get him. Can you help me? Of course. I won't tell a soul. Let the tree trimming begin! Okay... Wait! Before you start, I have a system. Let me show you. You've got to go with it. Okay. Show me how to do it. You see, it's very just kind of... Yeah. I've been doing it wrong my whole life, I think. You didn't even know it, did you? I didn't, no. A method to the madness. Hi, Mr. Hathaway. I'm sorry, we're closed for the gingerbread contest. That's okay. I'm actually here to talk about business. Business? Yeah. It's perfect. It sure is. Hey, kiddo, it's almost gingerbread time. I'll go upstairs and get ready! She's happy. You're great with her. You think so? I worry she's not having any fun, you know, like a proper kid. We had fun just now, didn't we? Totally. Totally. But you know, I worry that she takes herself too seriously. I think that she thinks of herself as a burden, and that's why she has to be so perfect all the time. I tell her that she's already perfect, and she is. I'm sure she knows how much she means to you, and I'm certain Paige would approve of everything you're doing. Thanks, Nell. Has it been hard to date? You know, with raising Marnie by yourself? I sort of gave up on that part of my life when I moved back here. You know, Marnie, she had lost so much. I didn't want anything to come between the two of us. Dating, it hasn't really been a priority in my life. How are things with Brad? Nothing really to report. We just met. Yeah, I just wanted to make sure you're happy. Thanks. All right, everyone has candy at their stations. Now, once the timer begins, you'll have until the buzzer sounds to make you best gingerbread house. And, as usual, your creations will be judged by the beloved Mrs. Ferguson. I am here to be impressed, but I will not be playing favorites! Did you hear that? Come on. Come and get your gingerbread. - I'll be right back. - Okay. One second. So, how are you liking your first Kringlefest? It's amazing. Good! And this is probably pretty different than most events you go to, huh? Oh, yeah. I mean, it's not even close. It's even better. Good. I got something for you. It's an offer for the store. Thanks, Brad, but I'm not interested in selling right now. Have a look at the terms before you decide. Your shop is at the top of my wishlist. Technically, it's my niece's store. It'll go back into her name when she's old enough. Right, but you have power of attorney, correct? That's right, but I think it's in her best interests that I hold on to what her mother created. Hey, I totally hear you. Just have a look at the numbers before you decide anything. It is a very generous offer and it could set the both of you up financially. Plus, you have to think about all that free time you'd have to pursue other interests. Okay, I'm going to read this, but I'm not going to make you any promises. Great. If you have any questions, you know where to find me. Sorry about that. It's okay. All right, everybody, your time begins... now! So what were you talking to Emmett about? His bookstore. It's one of the properties that I want to buy. I didn't know it was on the market. Technically, it's not, but I made him a very generous offer. Hey... Maybe you could put in a good word for me, since you guys are old friends? Yeah. I could do that. Thank you. All right, everybody, this is the final minute! Looking good! That's okay, that's okay. We can work with this. We can work with this. We did it, Marnie! We did it! Good job, Marnie! It's been wonderful having you here, dear. Thank you. I wish you were part of our book club permanently. Same. That would be so fun. What's your favorite carol? I actually don't know very many. Do you think you could teach me? Sure! So... Did he make you an offer? A very large one. Did you accept it? No, but I have to say I'm considering it. He said I could stay on as the manager, even after the sale. It's a tough decision. It is. It is. I have to think of Marnie and what she'd want to do with the store. Yeah, but it will be years before she takes it over, and you don't know what she'll want then. I know. That's the problem. I don't. Come on. Let's go sing. You didn't have to walk me home... or to the inn. Don't you have to get back to Marnie? No, no. Marnie is sleeping over at Jenny's house. And besides, you know, Springdale at this hour is a hot-bed of nefarious activity. Hooligans abound. Oh, yeah. I can see that. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, I know that you're leaving tomorrow, but I hope that we can... I hope that we can stay in touch this time. I hope so, too. There have been so many times I'll hear something that will remind me of you, or I'll hear something I know would make you laugh. You never thought to call me? I did. Of course, I did, Nell. It's just that it doesn't seem fair to jump back into your life, out of the blue. It would have been nice to hear your voice. And at least know you were doing okay. Yeah. Next time the mood strikes, promise you'll call? I promise. Hey, so I have to chat with Marnie tomorrow before I leave. We have some important business to discuss. She's not going to let you leave without saying a proper goodbye. I'm going to go now. Goodnight. Make sure you send me those stories. Oh, yeah. I'll make sure you get them. I'll make some copies before you leave. Maybe you can read them on the plane? Sounds good. I will. Merry Christmas, Nell. Merry Christmas. Goodnight. Caroline! Hi! I think you're going to be super excited when you see these new pages. Are you okay? We've been hit. What? The entire family has the flu. The girls must have caught it at school and brought it home to infect all of us. We're just gonna quarantine ourselves in here until it passes. That's horrible. Can I order you some chicken soup or something? Do they sell it by the gallon? I'm so sorry! No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for leaving you stranded. Tell me that you have somewhere to go for Christmas. No, it's all right. I'll get some takeout and get some work done. It'll be good for me. Come on, I feel even worse now. Just focus on getting better. So how have things been going? Good. Yeah, I think you'll be pleased. No, no. I mean how are things going with Brad? I don't think things are going anywhere with Brad, actually. I was really excited by his enthusiasm, but I think he might be a bit misguided. And how about Emmett? I have a lot of respect for him. The way he looks after Marnie and... the town... it's really inspiring. Inspiring some more pages, I hope? Even the flu can't stop you. Merry Christmas! I gotta go. Merry Christmas. You guys are going to love it here. My renderings can only show so much. The local diner will serve artisanal cheese and imported wines? That's right. Yeah. Only the best for our prospective visitors. Now, the research says that bringing in higher-end clientele to Springdale is the best way to turn it around financially. Hey! Nell! You came down just in time. Have a seat. These are my colleagues. This is Julia and Lance. This is Nell Phillips, the novelist I told you about. Hi. So, what do you have planned for PaigeTurner? Just a few embellishments and upgrades. Now, the main thing I want to do is get rid of that quaint, old cataloguing system for something people can, you know, actually understand. I see. Are you from here, Nell? No... but I'm starting to wish I was. Brad was just about to give us the tour. Would you like to join us? No thanks. Brad and I see this town a little differently. But enjoy it. Springdale's a wonderful place. I should go. Hold on one second. Hey, Nell, wait up. Are you upset with me? No. Not at all. I just feel like I finally understand you. Brad? - Are you ready? - Just one second. You should go deal with your colleagues. Are you sure? That's why you came here, isn't it? Goodbye, Brad. You guys ready for the big Springdale tour? So where did it fall on the X axis? - Six? - And then this one? Three? There's the girl I wanted to see! Nell! So I have an idea for that project you were telling me about. Hey, Nell, secrets are no fun. So, your last day, huh? Yep. It all went by so fast. What are you doing for Christmas? Well, as it turns out... nothing. Nothing? You can't do nothing for Christmas. That's no good. I know, but my friend and her family just came down with the flu. Well, all right, well, the solution seems pretty obvious to me. You're going to forget your flight back to New York City. And stay here? You could do Secret Santa! You did say the atmosphere around here was helping clear up your writer's block. I did say that... I did say that. And I have always wanted to see a true Springdale Christmas... Well, then it sounds to me like the solution is pretty obvious. Okay. I guess I'm staying. Yay! Want to go skating with me and Jenny? I have some bad news, kiddo. I have to stick around here and help the caterers set up for tomorrow's party. Shoot. Well, you know what, if you can wait a few hours, I'll take you. That's okay. I can just do some math exercises instead. I can take her. Well, I'm... if you're in the middle of writing, I don't want to disturb you. No, it's fine. I could use a break. You're sure? Please, Uncle Emmett! All right. Well, if you're sure. Come on! But I have to warn you, the last time I went skating, I was your age. I might need some extra help. Marnie, don't break her. You weren't kidding. Yeah, ice really isn't my thing. You'll never learn if you don't let go. Has anyone ever told you you're a very astute kid? Uncle Emmett says I'm advanced. I study all the time. Let's sit down for a second. You know, you don't have to worry so much about your grades. You're still just a kid. I told you I lost my parents when I was young, too, right? I wasn't as young as you, but I remember how hard it was. Did you have other family? I have an aunt and uncle and cousins. I see them a few times a year. And some of my closest friends became like family. That's nice. I just want you to know that your uncle is so proud of you, and the one thing that makes him happiest is seeing you happy. Should we try this again? I need practice. You've got to give me some lessons. Let's go fast. Well, looks like skating was a success! Hey, how'd she do? She's basically a professional. "Basically a professional"? That's high praise. I've never gotten that. Hey! Hi, Stacy. Hi, Mr. Turner! Hey, Marnie! So, we're going to go. The kitchen is full of food. Help yourself to whatever food you want. Thanks! Let's make a little snack right now, okay? And, hey, you, young lady, are not allowed to do any homework while I am gone. Do you understand? Only fun things. Is that clear? Clear! Clear. All right. Love you. - Have fun. - Thanks. - Bye! We'll see you later. - See you later. Bye-bye. Well, thank you for helping me set up for the book club. It's the least I can do, the way everyone's welcomed me in. Especially you. All right, so we know you're no good at winter sports. What do you do for fun? I'll have you know, the second the weather warms up, I'll be showing off my softball skills! Now, that I would like to see. I still like going to the theater. That's another thing I miss about New York City. I signed up to help with the local theater group, and Jenny... has a beautiful singing voice. No kidding? Yeah. We're putting on a production of "My Fair Lady" this spring. You should come back and see it. Wouldn't that be lovely? That's a reference from the play. Thank you. Hi. Welcome to the book club! Hi, Nell. Nell, you described how we celebrate Christmas here. You did it so perfectly in your book. That's why I'm so nervous about Brad's proposal. I don't want him to change what makes this town so special. It's not change. It's enhancement. Oh, please! He wants to turn this town into a cookie-cutter town, with no heart. Well, Brad's ideas have been interesting. I mean, especially since my sales have been so down. He did just come and give us a very generous offer. We haven't made any decisions. But with what he offered, we would have a nest egg for our little egg. And Emm could do the same for Marnie. I don't know, Hayley. This isn't just a store. It's my sister's legacy. It'll still be here if you want to visit. Listen, Steve, I appreciate how attractive these offers sound, I really do, but don't we value our own traditions and the community that we built? I mean, life can't be measured out in dollars and cents. I'm sorry, but I, for one, am not going to accept the offer. Well... this is book club, so let's get back to the book. Nell, I was wondering, what is your writing process like? Is that the correct term? Well, I start with brainstorming. You've probably seen me around with my notebook? You must be finding lots of new details to incorporate into the sequel. Which we can't wait for! Absolutely. Descriptions, funny ideas, lines of dialogue. I write down everything. I don't even turn on my laptop until I have a clear roadmap ready. So you're oldfashioned like Emmett. What I think Steve means is that Nell and I are classic. I like the feeling of my pen and paper. I can't describe it. It's... there's just something substantial about it. Substantial! See! No. No. Why don't you tell us a bit about Amanda. Was she based on you? I mean, I notice that you're both single. Well, you know, I don't know if Amanda was inspired by me, or if I was inspired by her. You're right. I have been focusing on my career and not really dating much lately. I thought you were dating Brad. We're not dating. So final impressions of the town that inspired Derryville? I thought I knew what it would feel like to be part of a tight-knit town. But after being here and experiencing it... my imagination pales in comparison to the real thing. And you can't simply replace the things that make Springdale... Springdale. No Springdale Christmas would be complete without a carriage ride. Would you care for a jaunt around the town? I thought you'd never ask. M'lady. - You got it? - Yeah. Let me see if I can get up. Here's a little blanket. All right, we're all ready. I read your stories today. Oh, right. Yikes. Put me out of my misery. What did you think? They're fantastic. I'm serious, Emmett. A gift like that shouldn't be hidden away. Well, it's not... it's not in hiding. I'm on hiatus until Marnie is okay. She is okay. She more than okay. She's amazing. And I know you want to be a good role model for her, so shouldn't you show her how to pursue your dreams? Geez. When you put it like that... You need to stop putting your own life on hold. Okay, I never wanted to run a store, but I've grown to love it, and it helps me feel close to Paige, and I can honor her memory by doing right by it... and Marnie. I think you should do whatever makes you happy. It's time you went after what you really want. Hey, good morning, Peanut! Merry Christmas Eve! How are you liking Nell's book? I love it! My favorite is the boy Amanda likes. He kind of reminds me of you. All right, I'm going to make some breakfast. I'll let you know when it's ready. Well, Nell dear, you have put some pep in the town's step. I feel like the town has put some pep in my step. I think that being on the road as long as you've been on the road, well, I would think you'd be anxious to get home. Yeah. I suppose so. But, to be honest, it's really just become a place I can put my clothes away and sleep. It's nothing like what you have here. This... This takes years to build up. You have a very special home. Thank you. Now, between us girls, what is it you're looking for? I don't have a list or anything. Just someone that I can trust, who makes me laugh. Mostly... I just want a partnership where we can support each other's goals. And you've not found that yet? Sorry to barge in. It's Hayley. She's gone into labor. But she's a month early! I told Emmett we'd meet him at Steve and Hayley's house. Let's go! Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming. - How's Hayley? - Is there any word yet? It's good news. Steve called. They had the baby an hour ago. It's a girl! A healthy girl. That's wonderful! How can we help? Well, since the baby was born a month early, Steve wasn't able to finish the nursery and he still needs baby supplies, so we're all going to pitch in, yeah? I'll go to the diner and get snacks for everyone. Thank you, Jenny. Steve wants to come home and help add his own special touches, but he can't leave the baby and Hayley alone at the hospital. I'll go. I want to meet that baby! Do you think you could give me a lift? Of course. Be sure to meet us at the Kringlefest banquet, okay? - All right. - Let's get started. - Let's go. - Come on, everybody. She's so tiny and beautiful. Have you thought of a name yet? We're going to call her Eve, because she was our Christmas Eve miracle! That's so perfect. I was going to wait till the party to give you this, but... since you'll be a bit pre-occupied... This is from the Secret Santa. Oh, my goodness. Thank you. I love it. And then once you guys are feeling up to it, I thought you could come visit me in New York. Thank you. See Auntie Nell? I just can't thank you guys enough. Hayley's going to think this is so incredible. Steve, it was nothing. We're all family here. Whatever happens to one happens to all of us. Yeah, thanks. Look, Emmett, I know you're probably not going to want to hear this, but... I really think I've got to accept Brad's offer. I mean, I can barely keep my head above water at the store. And now with the baby... It's just... it's a lot. I don't think I have a choice either... the way things are going. I spoke with him this morning. He needs all of your properties for his vision to work. - Are you serious? - What does that mean? Well, if Emmett doesn't agree to sell PaigeTurner, he might rescind the other offers. Please, Emmett. We need this. I have Marnie that I have to think of first. We know, but we don't know what the future holds. I mean, as far as what Marnie's going to do, she may not know. Today, this is a really good deal. If you invest it right, you could really set yourself on the right foot. We all believe that this is what's best for the town. This is what you really want? Yeah. All of you? All right, I promise I'll consider it. Good day to you. What in the world? Who are they? That's Brad's team, I assume. I thought you said Springdale went all out for Christmas. Exactly. They do. And we're just here to help take it to the next level. Next level, Brad? This is kinda... Generic? This isn't how we usually celebrate Kringlefest. What's it typically like? Do you want to see pictures from last year? I have a whole bunch of all the different events. Yeah, that would be great, because this doesn't feel like Christmas. This is way too... polished. What am I missing, Brad? How do you plan to sell Springdale as a unique way to spend the holidays? - Excuse me? - Hi. Can you ring Brad's room for me? I'm sorry. Mr. Hathaway already checked out. Thank you. No problem. Nell, you made it! Hi. I have something for you. We aren't doing the Secret Santa exchange until later. It's not for Secret Santa. That's from me to you. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. Thanks, Nell! I'll open it tomorrow for Christmas morning. Sounds good. I'm so glad you stayed. Me too. The two of you drive a very hard bargain, but I am willing to increase... I'll come find you in a few minutes, okay? Moment of truth. All right. I'll sell. You've made a very wise decision. If you could just sign there at the bottom, you're good to go. I thought you said there were more important things than dollars and cents. How could you do this? Just because. It's just the best choice for everybody. No, it's not. What would Paige think? Your store isn't just a place to buy books. It's a place people can gather as a community. I thought it meant more to you than money. If you're so concerned about Springdale, why did you wait six years to come here? Maybe I would have come sooner, if I had heard from you, even once, since you left New York. - Hold on. - No, you hold on. And before you sign anything, you should see what Brad really has planned. It's none my business, but this town deserves better. Have a Merry Christmas, Emmett. Nell... Nell... The deal was that you were going to leave my store intact. All our stores. I underestimated the number of tourists that are going to want to come to Springdale next Christmas, so in order to keep up with my projections, you're going to need a major overhaul. I'm sorry, Brad, but I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to let him destroy Paige's legacy. Please be reasonable. Will you forgive me, Jenny? Sorry, Brad. You guys are making a very big mistake here. The deal's off, Brad. That is so much money. Call Nell Phillips. Hi. Hey, Nell. Merry Christmas Eve. Merry Christmas Eve to you, too. How are you guys feeling? We're hanging in there. Are you enjoying your Springdale Christmas? I don't belong here. It's time I get back to New York, where my real life is. What? On Christmas Eve? I'll call you when I land. Oh, Nell. Bye. I really wanted Nell to be here. I know, kiddo. Me too. But we're still going to have fun anyway, aren't we? And the next gift goes to Emmett. That's for me. All right. Let's see what we've got. "To Emmett. Love, Secret Santa". "The Adventures of Uncle Emmett and Marnie". Can you guess who it's from? I have a hunch. I think this is going to be a national best-seller. Thank you. Nell helped. I made it, but she gave me the idea. She did, huh? You know what, you just gave me an idea. Will you watch Marnie for a minute? I'll be right back. Of course. All right, kiddo, let's see this book. I'm... I'm really sorry for wasting your time. Are you kidding? We've been so caught up in how to capitalize on towns like this, that we forgot what actually makes them special. We needed this dose of the real Christmas sprit to see what is more important. I'll tell you what, let's set up a meeting with the mayor in the new year to discuss how we can help out... the Springdale way. Yeah. I'd love that. Hey, can I hitch a ride back to the airport? I mean, if we leave now, then we can still make it back for Christmas. - Sure. - Thanks, guys. - Hey, Scott, Merry Christmas. - Hey. I'm here to see Nell. Can you ring her room for me? I'm afraid you just missed her. She just checked out a few minutes ago. She just checked out... All right. Bye-bye. Hey, Nell. What happened? I ran over a pothole. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. What are you doing here? I wanted to say thank you. I think... that you saved the day, and you stopped us from making the biggest mistake of our lives. You didn't sell? No. Nell, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I left New York City so suddenly. I should have called you and given you the explanation that you deserved, but I was so sad. And I was overwhelmed. And writing you that letter... Letter? What letter? The letter I sent you a few months after I left. I didn't get a letter. Where did you send it? To the office. Emmett, I left that office about a month after you did. Oh, my gosh. And they didn't forward it to you? No. You didn't get the letter? Do you want to know what it said? I don't care what it said. I know why you left and I have all the respect in the world for you. I know that must have been hard. What matters is you're here now. That's all I care about. End of story. You know... I still would really like to take you on that date. Can I get a rain check? I don't know... That rain check's long expired. Yeah? You might have to ask me out again. All right. Nell Phillips... would you go on a date with me? I'm going to take that as a yes. It's a yes. Knock-knock. Anybody home? Merry Christmas! - Look who it is. - Merry Christmas. Did Santa come? You better believe did. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. I saved this one for last. It's a locket! Just like yours. I thought you could keep your treasures with you. Thanks, Nell. - You're welcome. - It's beautiful. Who even knew we had one left? But who do you think it's for? Does it say? It looks like a Secret Santa for Nell. For me? What is this? Let's see what we've got. It's perfect! Do you like it? I love it. Thank you. - Did you make this? - I did make it, yeah. With a little help from Mrs. Ferguson. Okay, okay. That's what it is. And Marnie. And, Marnie, what else did you get from Santa?
