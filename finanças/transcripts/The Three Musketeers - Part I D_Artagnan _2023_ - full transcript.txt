AFTER A FEW YEARS OF PEACE, THE FRENCH REIGN FACES A NEW RELIGIOUS WAR. KING LOUIS XIII, WHO STILL HAS NO HEIR, RULE A DIVIDED EARTH. THE PROTESTANT FORCES, SUPPORTED BY ENGLAND, THEY OPPOSE THE GREAT CATHOLIC REIGNS, WHO SEEK TO EXPAND THEIR POWER. THE KING COUNTS ON HIS POWERFUL MINISTER, CARDINAL RICHELIEU, TO RECOVER THE AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN. BUT MANY SUSPECT THAT THE CARDINAL HE WANTS THE POWER FOR HIMSELF. IN A CLIMATE OF CONSPIRACIES AND REBELLIONS, THE YOUNG D'ARTAGNAN RIDE FROM GASCOGNE TO PARIS TO JOIN THE KING'S MUSKETEERS. Get out! Bury them all. take care of her PARIS Mademoiselle Bonacieux? The Comtesse de Valcour expects an answer tonight. The ship will sail early tomorrow. Very good. "This Saturday, like all Holy Saturdays, you will confess in the abbey of Val de Grâce. I will also be there and I will confess that I only think of you. In six days, if I'm not dead, I will see you again, madam. Your servant. The Duke of Buckingham." He insists on coming to a city where he risks his life. And it also makes me risk my honor. Her Majesty, the Queen! With the agreement of the emissaries of her holiness the Pope, Arthur d'Épinay de Saint-Luc, Bishop of Marseilles, it will be found to the right of her majesty. His brother, Brother François de Loménie, - of the order... - What's up, brother? His marriage to the Duchess of Montpensier? Not interested? We should prepare for war, not for a wedding. A war? - A war against whom? - The Protestants. Sir, for weeks, La Rochelle has been consolidating forces, gathering men and weapons. They want a separation! If we do nothing, it will soon be a state within a state. The foot of England in France. Therefore, I see that she wants... That she declare war on the Protestants, And to England? Protestants obey the English. Saint-Blancard, their leader, is in London. Where he has been received by Buckingham in person. Why does the English minister of war entertain to the Protestants of La Rochelle, if not to prepare for war? We must rid the nation of these heretics! So it's not a war. What he wants is a crusade. - One God, one country, one religion. - Enough! I'm not going to order another St. Bartholomew massacre. The bells of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois They will resound for your wedding this time. And not because of a massacre of Protestants. Should I remind you that our father was murdered by Catholics? You should be careful with your devoted friends. -His Majesty of him hints that...? - I'm not implying anything. I am the king. The nobility truly yearns to fight for you, sir. - We are your real friends. - The king has no friends. He only has minions and enemies. It is time to show that here we are all his subjects. It is not like this? It is believed that Luis is the just one, but rather it is Luis who is weak. My son, you are not talking to your brother. You are talking to the king. Were you there, mother? Because I didn't hear your voice. Have you learned to speak out loud yet? Now learn to shut up. Maybe someone will listen to you. -The eminence of him. - My lady. And good? Thank you, Buckingham and the queen can finally meet... And the drawback? Dead and buried. The queen prefers dishonor to war. She will have dishonor and we will have war. Excuse me, I'd like to meet Captain de Tréville. Is he already waiting for you? No, but I have a recommendation. - So, line up over there. - Thank you. - It's two days of waiting! - No, there are three. The one in green arrived on Sunday from Carcasonne. Good luck. No, it is not valid. Hey stop! One and a half meters, 20 centimeters. Following. This could work for me. Open fire! Fire! Yesterday at dawn, Richelieu's guards they met a group of pigs, they were drunk and they had a feast in the street. And who do you think those useless were? The King's Musketeers! You have to know something, they recognized you. Captain, how do you expect...? I don't want the cardinal's guards to be mocked. - Captain de Treville? - Yeah? I am Charles d'Artagnan, my father gave me this letter for you. - d'Artagnan?, son of Achilles? - Yeah. What happened to your letter? We got shot by a musket, luckily my bible stopped the bullet. You are the first saved by religion this year. I knew your father well. What can I do for you? Be brief, my time does not belong to me. Leaving Gascogne, he wanted to wear the helmet like him. Since I was a child, I dreamed of serving the king and being a musketeer. I can write to the director of the royal academy, you will join the cadets, I can do no more. And maybe, one day, you'll be a musketeer. Don't worry, you won't have to wait long. - Excuse me. - What? Is that all? Do you think that's enough? I said sorry. I may have one arm, but I have two ears, and your apology was not sincere. I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry. You are very rude. When a Gascon apologizes, it means that he already did more than he should. It's clear to me that you're not from around here. I may not be from here, but I don't need a lesson in manners. I'll still teach you a lesson. My way, so you can learn. I know I'll be on your way very soon. I will be pleased. Calvary of San Sulpice, at eleven. Very good. Oh my God! Watch where you run! Sorry, I'm in a bit of a rush. You're quite a coward, aren't you? Why are you laughing? Tell the joke. I laugh when I want. I don't want to be made fun of. If you don't laugh, you will regret it. - And where would that be? - In Luxembourg. In Luxembourg. At noon. - To warm up a bit. - Very good. Runs. Well, one shot is enough, you understand? Yeah. I hit him several times and... Mister. It seems to me that this handkerchief belongs to you. No, you're wrong. It's not my scarf. - It's from my wife. - You didn't keep it right. I saw it at your feet, that's why I thought it was yours. - But it's clear I didn't see well. - You see? - I made a mistake. - I'm wondering the same. Look what you just provoked. Sorry, I don't want any trouble. Of course you don't want that. Do I look scared? Are you stupid? The wisest thing would be to be afraid. Maybe I am. I already noticed. Lord, what is not wise is to humble myself. Take. Listen. I only fight if forced to, I prefer to avoid it. But this is different... a woman was affected because of you. Because of me? I can't teach you how to live then I'll have to teach you how to die. And where would she be? At noon, Carmes street. Alright. Excuse me, could it be at one? Enjoy that extra hour of life, I give it to you. Thank you. I'm sorry, I confused you. Very sorry. I almost killed you. - Don't worry, it happens to me often. - I'm really sorry, I mistook you for someone who was following me. - It's no big deal. -Constance. -Constance Bonacieux. - Delighted. d'Artagnan. - You came for the ad, right? - That's how it is... - What ad? - The room for rent. I'll take it. Very good. But don't you want to see it first? Yes. No... because I've seen enough. It is possible that the blow affected your vision. I hope it hasn't affected your hearing. Yeah. The rent for the room is one pound, a week. - A pound a week? - That's how it is. With this I can cover four weeks... or four boards for my coffin. - Did I really hit you so hard? - No, is not that. But in an hour I have to face three men. So will you die? Yeah. But for a musketeer. Beautiful place to die. I agree. We had not introduced ourselves. Athos de Sillegue d'Hauteville. Count de la Fere. Charles D'Artagnan, of Gascogne. When we're done, they'll call me the child killer. And me the murderer of the elderly. Do I look slow? I thought I felt honored with this duel, - still with this wound. - If my right hand fails me. The left will be the one to kill you. I asked two friends to witness this moment. What's going on? Did you seriously talk to this man? He is Porthos, and that over there is Aramis. I will have a duel with Monsieur d'Artagnan. Me too. I have pending accounts with him. - At noon. - And I will kill him at one o'clock. Then Mr. Athos will go first, Mr. Porthos after - Aramis, the brave. - and Aramis at the end. I apologize for not being able to please all of you. By the way, when did you arrive in Paris, d'Artagnan? I arrived this morning. Three duels in three hours with three musketeers, if I didn't have to kill you, I'd buy you a drink. So toast to me. Look... is Jussac. He followed us. What are they doing? Duels are prohibited. Put down the swords and come back! My sword hates dust, Jussac. If you want her, come and she's all yours. Calm down, friend. There are seven of us, three of us. And Athos with one foot in the grave. Still I won't lose. Excuse me, they said there are three, I think we are four. And if you kill him? Is very annoying. Well, gentlemen? Have you already decided what you are going to do? Calm Calm. We were training this cadet at the request of Captain de Tréville. All for one! All for one! Aren't you Lucie de Maupin's brother? - Don't involve my sister! - Just go away! I will not repeat it! Go before I regret it! What day is today? Because it will be the date of your death. Today is September seventh. You will die today. I'm still a cadet I'll kill you when I'm a musketeer. d'Artagnan! The rivalry between troops is ridiculous, hateful. We can't let the nobles kill each other with a war on the horizon. Control your soldiers, and I will control mine. The king! So they are the demons, guilty of this. But they are sorry, your majesty. And they want to apologize. You cannot dispense justice. That right belongs to me. Only me. Mister. We implore your forgiveness. Who is this child? D'Artagnan, your majesty. Are you the one who gave him... the final blow to Jussac? Yes your Majesty. Well... the truth... he just didn't want to see reason. You are very arrogant, you know that? It's my charm. And I am at his complete service, his majesty. You should keep it. Because you better not spend it. Twenty men in two days, too many. At that rate, the cardinal will have to replace his entire company in three weeks. Well... give this boy proper clothes. I warn you, a king does not forgive... twice. Who will have a duel again. He will rot in the dungeon. I've never seen it, but it's worse than England. you didn't die No, I'm sorry, but you'll have to put me up. Too bad, he had already ordered the coffin boards. Excuse me, ma'am. perhaps the young man will not survive tonight. Now you are rich. My father used to say that money helps you, but it corrupts you in the end. He was right, another round. Thank you. Health! He has no chance, Aramis has principles. - Is married? -It's not that, it's just that he's a Jesuit, he is in the church and the army. In the morning he is a general, at night a bishop. And he always attracts married women. And Athos? He's got the hell out of him. He drowns them with alcohol, but they have already learned to swim. Aramis. What Porthos told you is a lie. He just told me you're a gentleman. Well no, I'm anything but that. You will see, d'Artagnan, if Porthos keeps an eye on you, it is because he has his reasons. - Do you like... - Why not? I like whoever is in my bed or on my plate. - They are many. - There are things I don't fuck, I don't even eat. What a pity. Yes, there are a lot! A thigh is a thigh! They are the Gascogne coal cadets from Casteljaloux. They are the Gascogne cadets Eagle eye, stork feet, cat mustache, wolf fangs. Cutting through the snarling mob, eagle eyed, stork footed. They carry an old vicuna whose feathers cover any hole. Hello good morning. So hello good morning. Good morning. How did you sleep? Good morning, Constance, good morning, Constance. Hey, no! No! No! His lordship, Athos d'Hauteville, Count de la Fère, fought in Flanders against the United Provinces. In Bavaria against the Holy Empire, in the Palatinate, in Lombardy and Savoy. He fought in more battles than all those gathered here. You don't deserve this but a pedestal. Thank you very much captain, but I don't judge statues, I judge men. Count. He belongs to one of the most noble families in the country. But blood and title cannot protect him. On the contrary, whoever is born noble must lead a dignified life. His brother, Benjamin de la Fère, is known for being an advocate for the cause of La Rochelle. Excuse me, is he also a Protestant? Yes, I am, sir. He believes in God? I believe in God, in the king and in France. In the Gospel of Saint John, when Jesus meets Pilate, he tells him: "I came to Earth to witness the truth." - To which Pilate responded... - What is the truth? Exactly. They arrested him this morning drunk, covered in blood, with a dagger in hand, an unknown woman, stabbed to death in his bed. And now I must find out the truth. Did you kill that woman? Did you kill that woman? Don't know. She couldn't she lie like everyone else? Does not know? No. And I will not lie to avoid death. Because my life no longer matters to me. Count, the best legacy a gentleman can leave is his example. His life is an example, and his death will be a better example. When a crime deserves death, the criminal is hanged, the nobleman beheaded. Knight Athos d'Hauteville, Count de la Fère, sentenced by court to be beheaded Monday on the place de Grève. We will appeal against it. Well, you have four days to prove his innocence or ask for royal leniency. God be with you. If Athos does nothing, we will do it for him. Investigate the woman, find out why she was with Athos. She is our only hope. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. No ring, no necklace, nothing. I could only identify the dagger wounds. A prostitute? Look at the delicacy of his hand this woman never worked in her life. A bourgeois or a noblewoman. Show her face. She is the woman who wanted to kill me. What's happening? What's happening? You were dead! I swear, I never saw them before. Shut up, shut up! Digging. We will never know who they were. Was he wearing a ring? I aimed at his leg. I know you took it. Where is that ring? Whose ring was that? What are you doing? - I hate dirtying my dagger. - He's going to hell. I hate torture. Everyone does it and that's why it works. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for sinners. Does she fear God? If God listened to him and didn't allow what I do, I would be struck by lightning. But look how clear the sky is today. Piety. What are you doing? - Chatting. - Chatting? Aramis's words are worse than daggers. There are three rings. The idiot doesn't remember anything else. Three gold helmets: Brissac Argis family. Lion and three roses: Dardel de Luzinais family. Eagle with swords: Valcour family. We are a few steps away from discovering our man. And the woman who accompanied him. At dawn, we will know who he was. With God's help, we will save Athos's life. NORMANDY BEACH Welcome to France, Lord Buckingham. - Did you have a good trip? - Arguably. He hadn't expected to see him before La Rochelle. Me too. But there are invitations that cannot be refused. What's the matter, sir? He is here, but he is not quite present. I heard that Gaston received a letter from his fiancée. She read it to his men, to ridicule the love words of a 16-year-old girl. She must be strong. Gaston is not like that. I'm afraid that what his brother wants the marriage will not be able to give it to him. Sometimes I think that I shouldn't be the king, but he should be. Luis, you are king by the will of God. I should go with you to the Val de Grace. Father Arnoux is a good adviser, he will calm me down. If it is what his majesty wishes, he would delight me. No, another day, perhaps. I hope you'll meet me after your confession. Madam. - What do you need? - Excuse me, I would like to see the Comte de Valcour. -He is not here. - Wait. I have something that belongs to you. I'll see if the countess can receive you, follow me. Isabelle de Valcour, delighted. Come in please. I'm very sorry to bother you, madame. On the contrary. I am grateful to anyone who can distract me from my loneliness. Her face looks familiar to me. Maybe we know each other? I am sure that if I had known her before her, it would have been almost impossible for me to forget her. I have just arrived from Gascogne. My name is d'Artagnan. Excuse my lack of finesse. Please sit down. Thank you. I've been cooped up here for months, treating a fever. I already forgot all the comforts. I hope with all my soul that you are better, madame. It seems that I will survive. What can I do for you? Yes, sorry. Recently, I have had this in my possession. And I need to find its owner. It is important. show me. It's Tancred's ring! - Tancred? - My brother. Where is he, ma'am? In the provinces, to buy horses. He will give you a lot of pleasure. When it was stolen a month ago, she was inconsolable. Last month... You seem disappointed, monsieur. No, I... it's nothing. I'm very happy for your brother, but a little disappointed that my trail ended here. All this is very mysterious. That's how it is... I have to go now, ma'am. I must find my comrades. Maybe they were luckier than me. I really thank you very much for coming to see me. He has done me a great favor. The pleasure is all mine. I assure you it is not. I can find the exit. My respects, madame. ISABELLE AND TRANCRED OF VALCOUR Monsieur? - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning, monsieur. I think I'll need your sewing skills. What needs to be sewn? Me. Come with me. You are lucky, for a few centimeters I would have hit you in the heart. But they already gave me It's too early to talk about love. I don't think I mentioned love. Shut up, or next time I'll sew your mouth shut. Understood. Ready. Thank you. Please stop moving. I am still. - But you keep moving. - Actually no, I didn't move. Maybe it's my heart dancing in my chest. If you keep looking at me like that, I won't be able to finish healing you. Then I won't, maybe that's easier. Or this is too much. I know! So you will be calm. Where did you get this from? From Isabelle de Valcour. Do you know her? No, she was killed a few days ago. A woman took her place, she was the one who wanted to kill me. - We must warn the queen. - The Queen? Put this on. Isabelle de Valcour was a messenger from Duke Buckingham. It is a trap. walking! VAL DE GRÂCE ABBEY Wait here. Good morning Dad. It is an honor to welcome you, monsieur. Please follow me. It's crazy. I would risk my life and my honor to be with you for a second. - It's very dangerous. - I know, I know I came as soon as I received your invitation. My invitation... my invitation? No. And your men? Come on! Don't be afraid, madame, it's my life they want! Is he! He kidnapped the Countess de Valcour! Let her go! I see in your eyes the fear of losing myself. If your love for me means your death, I don't want to live another day. If you cry for me, it's because you love me. I am faithful to my king. I am his wife and I have never betrayed him. You must forget me and forget this love. Ask me never to return and I will obey. Just let me answer to make sure I'm not dreaming. If I give you what you ask, would you do what I ask? Immediately. Leave and never come back. I beg you. Now we are bound by a secret. My life won't be long enough to thank you. But if you ever need the help of the Queen of France, she will be there for you. I fear, her majesty, that day she is closer than she thinks. There is another victim of this Val de Grace conspiracy. A musketeer... to whom they want to cut off his head for a crime he did not commit. And then? And then it was something terrible and beautiful at the same time. There they were, trembling against each other. She gave him the earrings from her. The duke said something very nice to him before leaving: "I leave you, but I have you close to me." It is very sad. Yes you're right. He must have kissed him. You're saying words I only thought. Thank you. Her life does not belong to him. She is the queen of France. Yeah. But you are not. Constance. I'm touching your heart. - You blushed. - No! Dresses? It is not what you are thinking. It is because of modesty before your flattery. No. she rests. - It's not that way. - I know. What did you do yesterday in Val de Grace? I saw Father Arnoux. Wasn't it maybe... - Buckingham who wore the cassock? - That? What are you talking about? What all of Paris is talking about! Was it not rather the cardinal - the one who is slandering me? - It doesn't matter. You're not going to answer? What is the accusation of that serpent? For offering your diamonds to the English. Are here. Open the box. If you have so little faith in me. Forward. Check it out, show me the little... I respect that you have me. Since your wife's word... worth much less than that of a slanderer. Open it. Alright. But she puts aside the rumors. Next Saturday, at Gaston's wedding, they will appear with their crowns. Very good, Monsieur, if that is your will. And about the musketeer. He murdered a countess, he will be beheaded. That is also my will. He leaves for London this afternoon. In fact, the duke will be at the ball. And he will carry the diamonds. He is among the most protected men in England. He's going to be very expensive, isn't he? Go to the treasury for your payment. You'll get double if you come back before Saturday and before Gaston's wedding. The king did not spare the musketeer from him. He is more concerned with his own fate than his own men's. I am like him. Do not disappoint me. I'm so sorry I can't see the execution. Bring me those diamonds. And you will be able to attend the queen event. We have to stop it. No one but the king can judge others, and we cannot escape his decision. But he is innocent! He's over. We can't do anything for Athos. Dear friends... don't be sad Today is a good day to die. I gave everything in life, death can't take anything else. Aramis, I leave you my rosary. I'm sure you'll make good use of it. Porthos, I'll leave you my watch. I know you'll like it. d'Artagnan, Although I did not have the opportunity to know you well, I leave you my sword, I know it will be useful to you. We were the three musketeers thanks to you D'Artagnan, we will be forever. My friends, I say goodbye quietly with your head held high. It was an honor to fight alongside him. Bye bye. Long live the king, and long live France. Back back! Aside! This is a rebellion. - I forbade them! - I swear, captain. For our lives, which were not us. But I know a man who would risk everything to save Athos. Benjamin? Benjamin! I told you that I would see you in hell. Brandicourt! Saint-Blancard! Your brother convinced us to come save you. I never imagined that he would see you again. Catholic songs, did you convert? To fight your enemy, you'll see. Benjamin de la Fere, brother of Athos He is the right hand of Horace Saint-Blancard. And who is he? The leader of the Protestants of La Rochelle. What's up, captain? An edict of Cardinal Richelieu. Close the doors! If you didn't become a Catholic, they would cut your head off as a Protestant. Tréville did not help you, nor did the king. Only Richelieu is the one who governs. We will create a protestant republic. Autonomous. join us, or join them. We will fight for what we believe in. The war is coming, you decide. They accuse us of freeing Athos. Let no one leave the premises! Silence! I will go to see the king, to plead our cause. Aramis, Porthos, de Quillac and Bercquet. Whoever moves, shoot him down. Uzan and Ventadour, come on. Quarantine is only for musketeers. Go home, d'Artagnan. Do not stop. And follow me. In London? There's still hope the cardinal will do everything to overthrow the queen. Be brave, but above all, be prudent. Your wish is my command. I'll go right now. Wait. Here, for your trip. I have already been richly rewarded. If I succeed, maybe you'll fall in love with me. Don't worry. I'll be back with the diamond necklace. Athos? Is this how you fight with my sword? How did you find me? Because of Mademoiselle Bonacieux? Beware of women, d'Artagnan, they are worse than rifles. Have you ever loved? Look around. My misery was for her. I can't believe that love always lead you down the worst path. I'll tell you a story. Happened to you? No, to a close friend. Long ago, a young earl. Walking through his land, he met a woman. She did not please she intoxicated She was so beautiful, so pure, that he could have seduced or forced her. And though he was in the war, his heart remained... noble... and sincere. He hated crowds and the mundane. They married in secret, without their families. And they lived like this for more than a year. Far, only them. They were happy, as much as... what does not last The young count had a brother, and he too was going to get married. It was impossible for the count not to attend the wedding. And this time his young wife agreed to accompany him. When she introduced it to her brother, he turned pale... He recognized the beautiful woman, he had already met her in Paris. At night, in the room, The woman confessed the whole truth... Indeed, she was the woman the brother knew. Well, she wasn't anymore. She was running away. Married at the age of 15 to a marquis, she was subjected to the worst vile things on her part. And one night, when he tried to get from her what he no longer wanted to give her, he fought back. And she killed him. Terrified, due to her conviction, she fled under a false identity. And so began a life full of lies. But what did the count do? Count? He was a great man. In his lands, he was in charge of justice. He cared about his rank and title. He turned her over to the authorities. She was judged and marked for what she did. They hung her up. No! ENGLAND, BUCKINGHAM CASTLE And good? There are enough soldiers to go on a crusade in Jerusalem. Come on! I don't think there are that many. This should suffice. I see a certain irony in his choice of suit, monsieur. Oh really? As God of the seas he could invade France. Do I know you, harlequin? May be, maybe not. Italian? I'm in love with Italy but not. Is she Spanish? She has traveled a lot! I love discovering new places, my prince. I need a drink. The calm after the storm. Or maybe before the storm. She drinks like someone who has something to forget, Neptune. Hopefully it works. Do not go. Piety please! - Buckingham! - Leave it! I know this man and he was just enjoying the party. Did something happen to the queen? By order of the king, the queen must wear on Saturday, at the wedding of Gaston de France, a certain diamond necklace you know. Let her do her will. You are a fool, George! A charming, dark-haired, light-eyed woman and harlequin costume. You and you, come on! Stop her! Catch her! The necklace. I keep running into you. Did you like me that much? The necklace. Who do you work for, madame? To the devil, probably. There is a sparkle in your eye, d'Artagnan. And from that shine, I will make a fire that will consume it. No! PARIS Your Eminence, the ship arrived at Calais, but she was not on board. This way, gentlemen. You will thank our friend. Surely the Lord works in mysterious ways. Are you ready for the most important moment of your life? -The eminence of him. - Monsieur. The king awaits you, his majesty. I'm so sorry, your highness. Do it. Eminence, has he seen my brother? Yeah. And he already forgave me for getting married? She looked like he would leave the front. He must learn that marriage is a war without a winner. Because they all succeed. His highness possesses astonishing beauty. Madam. Tell me, why doesn't he wear his diamonds? He was planning to wear them to the dance tonight. You thought wrong. He goes for the necklace. But your brother is waiting for us. He can wait. His highness. Madame, a young man has arrived asking for you. He's at the service entrance, he's in a hurry. Is here. - Tell me you have it, please. - I have it. - Here you have. - My God, thank you. "God" is very strong. "My love" would be enough. You never stop, do you? - Constance? - Yeah? I... Tell me something. That you don't love me She tell me "D'Artagnan, I don't love you", and I swear that... It was just to shut you up! Hey. She was right, Eminence was just a slander. The queen does not deserve my wrath, but my trust. Thank you. d'Artagnan. - You arrived. - Yeah. We thought you were dead. Where you were? - In London, with Athos. - That? If you will fight an enemy, know him well. We will attack the heart of the kingdom. Gaston of France, Duke of Orleans, Valois and Anjou. Do you accept María de Borbón as your wife, - Duchess of Montpensier? - I agree. Maria de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier, Do you accept Gaston of France, Duke of Orleans, Valois and Anjou as your husband? I agree. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Church... I now pronounce you husband and wife. Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Back! Come out everyone! Over there, go! Over there! Come on! Step aside! Step aside! And Count Montecler D'Auvigné? He died two days ago, your majesty. And Beaulieu de Verricourt? They seriously injured him, he will not survive. And the prisoners? Achilles Brandicourt and Nicolas Beaumont. Protestant extremists from La Rochelle. They carried coded letters that we are deciphering. I will interrogate them myself, they will identify their accomplices. I will count on your gifts as a priest, Your Eminence. Meanwhile, he prepares the troops for La Rochelle. They don't want my peace. Let's see if they prefer my war. I will eradicate the Protestants from the city. I retire. For his exceptional service, to the crown of France, I name him, Charles D'Artagnan, lieutenant of the company of musketeers. I will be worthy of this honor, his majesty. Armand de Sillegue D'Athos D'Hauteville, count de la Fere, I owe you my life, sir. With this gesture, I acquit him. He is pardoned and reinstated immediately to the musketeer corps. The life that he gives me, I would give it again with pleasure for you. On your feet, gentlemen. Attention! Behold the famous three musketeers, which are now four. Bravo! Long live the king! Long live the king! Long live the Queen! - Her majesty. - D'Artagnan. I can't offer you any title.
