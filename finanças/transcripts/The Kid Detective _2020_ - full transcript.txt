Subtitles by explosiveskull Hello? Are you still in bed? No. I've been up for awhile. Hey, man. Hey. We brought you some groceries. Thanks. Jesus. I know, it's not me. So, what's new? Your moms biopsy came back benign. Really? Cool. You should go get your moles checked out too. Yeah, definitely. How are your finances? They're okay. Credit card? Could be worse. You know we're not bailing you out again? I had a big case last week. Really, what was it? You know I'm not supposed to talk about that stuff. This gay guy wanted to me to find out whether another guy was gay. Was he? Yeah. A little bit. Oh, that's nice. What's on your mind, Abe? Should I be worried if my pee smells like fish? Yeah, maybe. You know Rory Beans is in the back, right? So what? Just leave, man. We're not gonna judge you. I used to be loved. I used to be a kid detective. When I was 13, I solved the case of the missing fundraiser money. It was Rory Beans, the neighborhood knucklehead. Get him, Rory. In the beginning I ran my trade out of a tree house. Somebody stole the basketball magazines from my desk. Can you remember what else was in the cubby? My pencils, erasers, some peanut butter cups, a photo of my bird... But, nothing else was taken? It was Clive Cunningham. How do you know? He's the only one allergic to peanuts. Wow, thanks Abe. Whenever we watched movies as a family I would always spot the bad guy. It was the bald man. And guess the ending in the second act. She poisoned his drink. Seth Barret used to be nice, but now he's mean. I need you to find out what happened. Somebody keeps borrowing my bicycle without asking permission. I found this in the park. I need to know what it is. I noticed some blood on my dad's car. I want you to find out what happened. Are you sure? I saw that Constable Cleary was in the yard again. He wanted to catch me up on the latest cases. Oh, that's so cute. Son, we want you to know how impressed we are. I've never seen a young person take such initiative for the sake of their community. I was 12 when someone finally chopped down my tree house. The town raised enough money to set me up with a real office, in the middle of main street. The mayor's daughter, Gracie, was my secretary. I used to pay her in soda pop. Abe Applebaum's office. Oh, hi Daddy! He's in with Principal Erwin. Want me to take a message? Someone stole the cashbox from the school fundraiser. What was it for? Animal rescue. Rory Beans was bit by a dog last summer. Someone's been sneaking up the clock tower, changing the time. Sounds like the Red Shoe Gang. Don't you have a boy on the inside? Not anymore. He kept getting grounded. I was often in one of those situations where you're looking for evidence in a house, and then you hear the owner come home, so you have to hide. And it keeps seeming like they're going to open the closet, but they don't. And then you sneeze and give yourself away. Oh my God, that's adorable. Bill, come and look at this! One day, while taking a stroll, it suddenly occurred to me who had robbed Mr. Hepburn's candy store. I was awarded free ice cream for life. Here ya go, Abe. Thanks, Mr. H.. Good morning, Abe. Hi, Abe. As a reward for all my hard work, I was invited to play drums for Sharkwater at the annual Fall Barbecue. Sometimes I would lie awake all night and wonder if I was the smartest person in the world. Oh my god, I met this super cute boy at the record store last weekend. You're always meeting cute boys. It's driving me up the wall. - See you later. - See you later. It's been nearly two weeks since the abduction of 14-year-old Gracie Gulliver, and the local anxiety continues to mount. I can't believe it. She comes in my store all the time. Things like this aren't supposed to happen here. The mayor and his wife released this emotional statement on Tuesday. Hello? Hey Abe, it's Mindy Martingrove. Oh, hi. I was just wondering how much longer do you think it'll take you to find Gracie? Um... I'm not sure. My mom told me not to tell you this, but we're all really counting on you. I know you can do it. Constable Cleary still hasn't called me back. Try and get some sleep sweetheart. You have to stop torturing yourself. She knows you're thinking about her. Hello? Where the hell are you? It's Sunday. No. It's not. Fuck! Morning, Mr. Ackerman. Hey, sorry I'm late. Who did that? Some idiot I got suspended, 20 years ago. He stole the fundraiser money from the principal's office. And he's still pissed? His parents were about to buy him a hunting kit. The widow Gulliver was here, but she got tired of waiting. Is she coming back? Didn't I just find him? That was a year ago. So you're worried he's been hit by a car or something? If it was a simple accident, somebody would have called, wouldn't they? He's wearing his tags. Well, we're coming up on Halloween. It's possible he was used in some kind of satanic ritual. What? This is Willow Brook, and you know what kids are like these days. This guy in my homeroom, Henry Hooper, claims he was in New York over the summer and practiced with the Mets. I need to find out if he's lying. He's lying. I have a $50 bill... Let me see it. Butter pecan, please. Thank you. What's going on? Oh good, you got my text. Nothing worse than walking home with just toilet paper. Everybody knows you need to take a shit. I'll get it next time. Yeah, sure. Hi, is this Mrs. Hooper? This is gonna sound strange, but did your son play baseball with The Mets last summer? He didn't? Okay, thank you very much. There's a girl in your office. What? Who is she? I don't know. What's the matter? I forgot to brush my teeth today. Sorry to keep you waiting. I was out on a case. It's okay. I stole a magazine from reception. Some cool stories in there. Lucy forgot to get your name. Caroline. Can I fix you a drink? No, thank you. How about some water? It gets pretty hot in here. Sure. Yeah? Could you bring Caroline a bottle of water? From where? The store. Are you serious? - Yeah. - It's okay, really. It's no trouble at all. So when's the last time you solved a case? I solve them all the time. They just stopped putting my picture in the paper. Who's that? That's me and Mayor Gulliver. Isn't he the one who hung himself? He also founded the Potato Festival. I've actually been here before. Oh yeah? About five years ago. Someone stole a silver broach, at my 11th birthday party. You solved it in less than an hour. That's probably why I don't remember. You asked which of my friends had the most cake. It's an old trick. When you answer a question like that, your memory becomes extremely selective. You're really telling me who you trust the least without even knowing it. Cool. It only fails if you have a really fat friend. Jesus. So what can I help you with today? I have another case I was hoping you might consider. Of course. Somebody murdered my boyfriend. Seriously? Pretty seriously. He was stabbed 17 times. Um... - That's him. - Oh! Hi. Sorry I'm late. Oh, your face looks better. Why? What happened? He was in a bar fight. It wasn't like that. It's an occupational hazard. When he was in high school, kids used to throw beer bottles at the house. Oh, that's awful. You reek of alcohol. How's the sleuthing? Not bad. You know, we really admire that you're still doing that, sticking it out. It takes a lot of courage. You always knew what you wanted to do, and you're not giving up. You're living your truth. Thanks. What are you working on? He's not supposed to talk about his cases. Actually, I got a pretty big one today. Oh yeah? What was it? Did you hear about that kid? The one they found in the river a couple weeks ago? We were telling them earlier. Seems like the police are getting nowhere with the local youth, so his girlfriend hired me to find out what happened. Seriously? Yeah. I did some work for her a few years back. What'd you tell her? I told her I'd think about it. You can't take that case. - Why not? - Well, it wouldn't be fair. You don't have the experience. I've solved over 200 mysteries. How many of them have been murders? You're taking advantage of a young girl's naivety. She's not even paying me. Then what are you doing it for? Isn't this your job? Or are you still working for quarters? It's like you've forgotten who I am. Who are you? Abe! Applebaum! I solved the case of the missing time capsule when I was 12 years old! The mayor gave me the key to the fucking city! Finally, after all this time, somebody trusts me with a real case, a chance to prove myself. You're telling me I shouldn't take it? Good for you Abe. Stop, please. It is inadvertently patronizing. I know you don't mean it to be, but it is. Have you heard of the Red Shoe gang? Of course. Everyone knows not to go near the Boiler Room. What's the Boiler Room? The biker bar, where they all hang out. Oh, right. It used to be called The Steamer. What does this have to do with Patrick? Well, he was stabbed seventeen times. Usually when that happens, it's because you've pissed off the wrong people. Is it possible he was involved in something dangerous? Such as? - Drugs? - No. He would never do drugs. - Gambling? - No, he would never gamble. Demon worship? No, he would never worship a demon. Tell me about his home life. His parents were super strict. He had the highest grades in our year. Is it possible the pressure was too much for him? He was a good person, he wanted to do well. In this line of work you learn one thing quickly, everybody has secrets. No matter how simple a case may seem, it's always shocking what you find. I just want you to be prepared. Where do you wanna start? Shouldn't we talk to his parents? I don't know, that's a bit heavy, isn't it? Why don't we get warmed up first? His friend Billy works a few blocks away. His family runs the butcher shop? Yeah, why? I was working a case here the other week. Really? What was it? Nothing that serious. His dad might be a homosexual. Holy smokes. Don't say anything. Hey, Billy. Hi, Caroline. Who's this guy? He's a really awesome detective. He's gonna help me find out who killed Patrick. How many murders have you solved? I have to ask you some questions. I need you to be completely honest with me. Now, I know what it's like at that school. Drugs are more popular than milk. To the best of your knowledge, did Patrick have any contact with the kids on the stoop, or the Wild Geese? This guy has no idea what he's doing. Yeah? Well, your dad is gay. Who else lives around here? Can I offer you something to drink? Are those cupcakes I smell? Sorry, they're for my sister's class. My mom counted them. Is it her birthday or something? No. She's just not very popular. Calvin? Come upstairs please! Sorry, be right back. What are you doing? It's an old trick. Always open a window, wherever you're invited. Why? In case you need to sneak back in. What's the matter? Would it be easier if she left the room? No, it's okay. Caroline, I know you think Patrick was this perfect boyfriend, but he was a lot more complicated than he allowed you to believe. What do you mean? Give us an example. He used to collect bottle caps. So? He had thousands. It was compulsive. Anything else? Yeah, he lied, about movies he hadn't actually seen or books he hadn't actually read. Everybody does that. He was very impatient with handicapped people. Was he cheating on her or something? Why? You seem pretty determined to shit on his grave. I'm sorry Caroline. You shouldn't have found out this way. What are you talking about? He had a concubine. What's that? Sort of like a second girlfriend. - Who? - I don't know. But she sounded kind of wild. What the hell does that mean? He would brag about the stuff she did. Such as? Put her hand on his penis. That's not so bad. What else? Put his penis in her mouth. You know there are euphemisms for these things. Yeah, but I didn't want to sound vulgar. How do you know he wasn't making it up? He had a picture hidden in his locker. But you didn't recognize her? She was wearing a tiger mask. That's all she was wearing. I don't believe you. I'm sorry, Caroline. I wouldn't say it if I wasn't sure. God, those cupcakes were killing me. So how long were you together? Three months. But that's high school time. So like six? I don't know. I thought he was different from the others. Because he was a geek? He was cultured. I kept finding these origami roses in my locker, on days when I had a test or something. How'd you know they were from him? He was the only Asian in our school. I remember when girls still went for the star quarterback. Nobody cares about football. God, this town got cynical. Did it? Look at this place. On Saturday night, this was the center of the universe. They used to serve breakfast for dinner and dinner for breakfast. Why? To be funny. Are you sure you want to continue? Yeah. It won't feel real until I understand. Then we gotta break into the school. Why? I want to look for that photograph. - Shit! - What? They replaced the vent. I think there might be a window open on the other side. Why is that? The art class has been oil painting. - So? - Mrs. August is pregnant. She might be more sensitive to the fumes. Are you making fun of me or something? What's that noise? Must be the over-nighters. Who? You know, the kids who hide out at the school over the weekend? Good fucking god. This was his locker. - Shit... - What? The cops already cleared it. Just a bunch of fucking bottle caps. I still have his jacket. Ugh, gross. Oh, Jesus! Sorry. Oh, thank god. Huh... What the hell? Yeah? How did you know it was me? I didn't. I need you to put me in touch with your drug dealer. What? No. I want to ask him some questions about these pills I found. Why don't you ask your drug dealer? Because, we have a special relationship. I don't want to ruin that. So go talk to the kids on the stoop. No. Why? Are you afraid of they'll make fun of you? Yeah right. So that's the stoop? Technically, it's a concrete divider. Check it out. What's up Apple Bum? You know what these are? - Holy shit. - Yeah? Answer my questions, I'll give you some. They're called Ego Boosters. What do they do? Give you that extra nudge. You wanna ask out a girl, or do some stand-up, they improve your self-esteem. Looks like you guys could use some. They also get you super jacked. Why don't I feel anything? They take awhile to kick in, depending on how insecure you normally are. How much is this bottle be worth? Like a grand. Great, now he's not gonna give us any. Tell me who the supplier is, I'll give you the whole bottle. Candy store. Is that a code name or something? No. It's a candy store. Hepburn's candy store? Yeah, he's been selling for years. It's the truth. Just go in there and tell him you have a headache. You'll see. What happened? Nothing. I told him I had a headache. Okay, what happened next? I bought this ice cream. It was too awkward. Here, I got you this. Thanks. I think maybe those kids lied to you. Here comes the kid detective! Let me go! Abe, stop! Who is the supplier? Who is the supplier? The Red Shoe Gang! How long have you lived in this fucking town? Does it make you feel like a big man to beat up a kid? Yes! These pills are awesome. Yeah? Be careful, they're super addictive. What now? Take me to The Steamer. It's time to talk to some adults. I'm here to see Clive Cunningham. No peanut products. Right, sorry. Go ahead. We need to talk about Patrick Chang. No. He wasn't there. What does that mean? We'll just have to work it from another angle. Have those drugs worn off? Yeah, I think so. I don't know, maybe we should call it a day. What's the matter? You realize that if I go in there, we're really gonna have to solve this thing. Of course. It's just, I find that kind of pressure can be counter-productive. I'm very sorry to have disturbed you. I know how devastating and how deeply confusing these past few weeks must have been. It's, it's beyond awful. Do you have kids? What? No. So you don't really understand what we're dealing with. You're right. I'm sorry. It's been two weeks and the police haven't offered any clarity. They're so preoccupied with the physical evidence that they sometimes can overlook the more complex, psychological integers. What does that mean? Do you keep a lot of fruit in your kitchen? We used to. What did Patrick favor? When he was a kid he loved peaches. And in the weeks before his death? He ate a lot of bananas. They're dry, which means no mess, no plate, no paper towels. You don't have to cut them up, or even wash them. You see where I'm going this? No. I think he may have been depressed. Our son wasn't depressed. I found these, in his jacket. Open them up. They're called Ego Boosters, basically a mixture of coke and who knows what. Someone must have planted them. To make it look like a drug killing, after the fact? It hadn't occurred to you? I'm open to all possibilities. I realize it's probably easier to solve the murder of a drug dealer than a mild-mannered honor student, but these do not belong to our boy! Patrick was cheating on his girlfriend. With who? I don't know. I haven't found her yet. So how can you be sure? His friend told me. His friend told you, and you treat it as fact? No, Patrick had a picture in his locker. Which you saw? No. Are you a detective? Or just some idiot who believes whatever he's told? I've closed over 200 cases. How many of them murders? Three. Then don't let me discourage you. He was a very private boy. We didn't even know about Caroline until she called us after his death. It's difficult to accept, that you didn't know everything when you've loved someone so thoroughly. I promise you, I will not rest until this case is solved, and your family finds some source of peace. Don't promise that. It's silly. Can I hang onto this? What? I think I found that tiger. Really? How? Social media. I keep telling you to get with the times. Oh. Nice work. Hi, I'm looking for Melody Miller. A little old, aren't you? I'm a private detective. I need to ask her some questions... Spare me the theatrics. She's in the basement with her sister. Your mom seems nice. No, she's getting to that age where she thinks she's too cool for me. Who's Paul? Just some guy. He paid me 50 bucks to write his name on my face. Not bad. I can wash it off in a week. How much was Patrick paying you? It wasn't like that. Patrick and I had some very deep conversations. Oh yeah? What was perplexing him? He was very concerned about the environment, and whether or not our distinct identities are just an illusion. Impressive. Ever have any arguments? No. So you weren't jealous of his real girlfriend? She's just a kid, cute, but I'm complicated. Did Patrick know his life was in danger? The Red Shoe Gang had no reason to hurt him as long as he kept his grades up. I'm not sure I follow. Everyone had to submit their locker codes to the office as a result of all the drugs in the school. The principal could open them at any time. So, the suppliers had to recruit kids who were above suspicion. So the nerds became the new dealers? Whoever had the highest marks in each grade. That's awesome. Everyone knows smart kids have no spine. It doesn't take much to intimidate them. Have the police found you yet? No. Figures. Thank you very much, ladies. Thanks for waiting. I know this is weird. What's the matter? That car, it was with us at Patrick's house. No way. Do you think they're following us? Let's find out. What the hell? Try going faster. Okay. This is stupid. Okay, pull over here. Are you gonna do something? What? I mean, someone's obviously following us. Isn't it safer to know who? Yeah, I guess so. No way. What the hell are you doing? We were worried about you. Whose car is this? Your uncle's. You guys are unbelievable. Are you out of your mind? We saw you walk into The Boiler Room. How long have you been following me? Since this morning. Get the fuck out of here! I am working! Do you not you understand how humiliating this is? We... I told you, you should of backed up. Why would I back up? Well, who was it? Reporters, for the local paper. - Really? - Yeah. What'd they want? Just to follow our crumbs and break the case before we can. It happens all the time. That's so cool. It's irresponsible journalism. Oh. I won't be able to help much tomorrow. Why not? It's a school day. The Principal always calls if I miss class. Your parents seem pretty cool, about letting you drive the car at least. That's 'cause they're dead. I live with my grandparents. Sorry, I didn't realize. I was really young. How did they die? Downhill skiing. Oh. Both of them? Yeah. It was a very blistery day. In some ways you're lucky. My parents are always on my ass. I'm sorry. That was really insensitive. I love my grandparents, it's just not the same. They're pretty old. Must be lonely. I don't know. I've always felt like there was this other presence watching over me. Do you believe in that sort of thing? Yeah, sure. Why not? Good luck tomorrow. Let me know what you find. Sure thing. What are you doing here, Abe? You know you're not allowed on school property. A man just walked into your office. I know. I have the same problem. What do you want? To talk about Patrick Chang. You can't be serious. His girlfriend hired me. Is she okay? All things considered. I don't really think it's hit her yet. I'll help you with yours, if you'll help me with mine. One of the custodians found some broken beakers in the science lab this morning. And Mrs. Hersholt noticed some footprints on the floor of the gym. What? Over-nighters. Excuse me? Kids who stay at the school over the weekend. How long has this been going on? I don't know, seems like a pretty established sub-culture. So, what can you tell me about Patrick? He was a quiet kid. He used to mouth the national anthem, as if we couldn't tell. Is that it? No. I was warned that he might be mixed up in something about a week before his death. By who? One of his friends. I'm too old to keep the names straight. Was he tall and ugly, or portly and pathetic? He was a bit heavy, yes. Calvin? Mm-hmm. I checked Patrick's locker, I couldn't find anything. Another fight in the girls' restroom. Who is it this time? Both Beckys. What am I supposed to do, Abe? These kids have no concept of authority. I don't know, dude. Maybe there's more nobility in just giving up. Maybe. Oh, wicked. "I only get one life, one body, and I'm trapped in a teapot. A harmless shell, with no hard edges, no one can see how much love and violence I have inside my soul." Jesus Christ. "How to make her understand I'm the one who really sees her, who knows what she's worth, who would never mock her innocence, or take advantage of her trust." That's motive, motherfucker. Hey, turn the music down, please? What are you doing home already? Last period spare. Want me to fix you a snack? No thanks, I'm not hungry. Mom wants you to set the table. I'm doing my homework. No you're not. I set it last night. Okay. Calvin, come down here please! Little bitch. Where are you going? I need to pee. - Jackie? - Yeah? You haven't finished your potatoes! I'm full. What did she say? But I thought she liked Jake? Time for bed honey. Okay, five minutes. Benji's an idiot. He didn't even know what a kayak was. Mom? I'm scared. Of what? I think I heard something in the closet. Come on Jackie, I thought we were past this. You're too old for any more monster nonsense. Sorry. Go to sleep. That kid is traumatized. The family is furious. Did you explain? What the hell was I supposed to say? That you're some wandering mental patient? A private detective. She's nine years old. I was investigating the older brother, but I got trapped in the house. In connection to what? The Patrick Chang murder. Who hired you for a homicide? His girlfriend. I hope you're not charging her. What have you found so far? I can't talk about that. It's an active investigation. Why didn't you call me back, after Gracie got kidnapped? Because you were 12. So. I'd helped you before. How would it have looked, the police chief consulting with a child in the middle of our town's greatest crisis? You weren't the chief back then. Well, lucky for you, I am now. I'll see what I can work out with the family, convince them to drop criminal charges. Thank you. This has to stop, Abe. Gracie was not your responsibility, and neither is this. You can't run around calling yourself a detective and expect everyone else to play along. You know I've always liked you. But at a certain point, we've all got to grow up. Maybe this is that opportunity. Your parents posted your bail. Hello? You finally made the paper again. What does it say? That you were found masturbating in a little girl's bedroom. I wasn't masturbating. I believe you. I'm really sorry, man. But my friend really needs to get in there. It was the maid. Thanks for coming, man. I've just been drinking too much, you know? Hey. What are you doing here? I'm sorry, but you weren't answering my calls. Yeah, I've been busy, and you're not and paying me, so I had to prioritize. I found another paper flower, in my locker. Okay. What do you think it means? That they were never coming from Patrick. What? Origami is Japanese. He probably just took credit for it, because you started talking to him. Oh my God. I'm such a racist. Oh, relax, it's not that bad. Well, then who's making them? Probably Calvin. He's in love with you. What? How do you know that? I'm sorry. I gotta go. Are you ever gonna get dressed? Why? I have people coming over. In the middle of the week? It's fucking Friday, man. For real? What the hell? What? Caroline? Where are you? I'm outside your place. You are? You called me at midnight, remember? I did? You might have to refresh my memory. You said you wouldn't rest until this case was solved and my family found some sort of peace. Remember? Are these your parents? Yeah. They're very photogenic. I know. And these are your grandparents? Mm-hmm. Where are they right now? Probably out feeding pigeons. Thanks. I need to apologize for the other day. It's okay. I'm sorry you had to see me like that. I was in a pretty bad place. I got arrested. I know. You saw the paper? I went to your office. Your secretary showed me. What a cunt. The people in this town used to look up to me, even the adults. I was so far ahead of the game, and then, one day I just woke up behind. What do you mean? A few years ago, I heard my roommate talking about me when he thought I wasn't home, and he called me a detective, in quotes. I could hear him doing this with his fingers. It's difficult to accept the difference between who you are in your head and who you are in the world. I know what you mean. You do? People act like I've never seen a restricted movie before, or stayed up past midnight. Even my own boyfriend saw me as this little girl. Don't blame yourself for what that kid did to you. Experience is overrated. The world has enough assholes. It's been awhile since I've known anyone like you. Reminds me why I got into this business. Your clothes are ready. What the hell happened? I had some friends over. The door's unlocked. What if a client came in? I wouldn't worry about that now that you're the town pedophile. The phone's off the hook. I wanted to make sure you were okay. Wow. What is this thing? That girl left it for you the other day. It's from her dead boyfriend. Poor Calvin. I need the key to the garage. Wow. Hello? I need you to stay home tomorrow. What? Why? It isn't safe. They're not coming from Calvin. Have you found my cat yet? No, I actually completely forgot about that. I'm here to talk about your daughter. You preserved her bedroom. The house hasn't been touched since Burt died. Yeah, my parents just redid mine. Do you know where this came from? She never said anything about a secret admirer. Who could keep track? Is everything okay? Yeah. Nothing to worry about. Find my cat, Abe. I'm lonely. Everything alright, Abe? Yeah, why? Nobody real comes in before five. My mind's running races. I need to relax. What happened the other week with Rory Beans? He beat the shit out of me. Why don't you just apologize? For what? No one forced him to steal the fundraiser money. He didn't do it, man. What? Why do you think he hates you so much? He stole the fundraiser money from the principal's office. - What was it for? - Animal rescue. Rory beans was bit by a dog last summer. Who did that? Some idiot I got suspended 20 years ago. He's still pissed? Everyone had to submit their locker codes to the office. I found another paper flower in my locker. Has she ever said anything about a secret admirer? I've always felt like there was this other presence watching over me. Yeah? Hey, I need you to check the date on the first Rory Beans case. Are you serious? There was a chance he was set up. I might know who's really making those flowers. What the fuck? Abe, I know you're in the closet. I'm under the bed. Why aren't you at school? It's Sunday. What are you doing here Abe? Do you remember the first case you ever brought me? No. Somebody stole the cashbox, from the school fundraiser. That was the last year we had one. I think I might have made a mistake, implicated the wrong kid. Who cares? Wasn't this years ago? You found it in his desk the next day. I don't understand. You were just testing me, weren't you? Trying to see how my head worked, if I was really as smart as everyone said. Why would I care to do that? Gracie was kidnapped a week later. What are you asking me? Are you the bad guy? I'm an educator, Abe. I hope you understand how even the most outlandish claim could tarnish my career, stir doubts about my character. I found the picture, you stole from Patrick's locker. You thought it was Caroline, didn't you? In the tiger mask? It wasn't? Are you sure? I know about the paper flowers. You killed her boyfriend. You wanted someone innocent, untouched, just like Gracie. You thought he ruined her for you. Gracie wasn't innocent. She used to stop by my office, just to show me her outfits. She was 14. Of all people, you should appreciate the relativity of age. That girl got what she always wanted. She would have loved to see this place, her face on every telephone pole, people marching through the marshes, arm in arm. For a month, the whole country knew her name. I should have seen it. I could've saved her. You were just a kid. No one expected you to find her. She did. Abe, I watched you grow up, with the weight of the entire town on your conscience. I always felt a little sorry for you. No child could survive that. What happened to her? She didn't last long. Her spirit went soft after I gave our daughter away. What? Everyone knows me here. I can't have a newborn suddenly appear out of nowhere. It wasn't easy, leaving Caroline on the steps for those decrepit church mice, but I knew they wouldn't ask any questions. My only consolation was watching her mature with such grace and sensibility. I took something beautiful, but I gave something back, something better. Balance was restored. I was relieved when I first heard they were dating. He seemed sort of sexless and irrelevant. Congratulations, Abe. You've solved your first murder. What now? I'm not afraid of you. Nobody is. There's a reason I always obliged you, Abe. We both know how it feels when nobody takes you seriously. Now they'll know what we were capable of. Abe? I found her. What are you talking about? The cat is a boy. I found her. What? She's too scared to talk to me. When I was 32, I solved the case of the Willow Brook kidnapper. It was Ellis Erwin, the evil Principal. Gracie's discovery remained a national news story for weeks. I was the "kid detective," who never gave up. The Governor presented me with a medal. Rory Beans accepted a handshake.

It's not like you didn't warn me. "No matter how simple a case may seem, it's always shocking what you find." I was just being pretentious. Still, isn't it better to know the truth? Well, at least you saved Gracie. Yeah, sort of. Has she reached out to you yet? She's just a kid. Hi. Can I get you a tea or something? Oh, no thank you, we're okay. How are you enjoying the extra space? It's great. Not a little lonely without Corey? - He was kind of a deadbeat. - Oh. It's so tidy. Yeah, I hired a cleaning lady. Oh. Oh, did you see you were in another magazine? It's a story that touches people. Getting any money out of that? It's good for business. You, um, you seem tired. Yeah, I've been having a little trouble sleeping. Why? What's wrong? It's nothing. The floor creaks at night. You know they um, they called us for a quote, I hope you don't mind. Are you alright? Abe. What's the matter? Subtitles by explosiveskull
