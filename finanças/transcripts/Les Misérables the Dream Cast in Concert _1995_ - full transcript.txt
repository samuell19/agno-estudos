-- Les Mis?rables 10th Anniversary Concert -- -- Les Mis?rables 10th Anniversary Concert -- - Live at the Albert Hall, London - --( Subtitle transcript/synchro by Soulhunter )-- Look down! Look down! Don't look 'em in the eye. Look down! Look down! You're here until you die. The sun is strong, it's hot as hell below. Look down! Look down! There's 20 years to go. I've done no wrong; sweet Jesus hear my prayer! Look down! Look down! Sweet Jesus doesn't care. I know she'll wait... I know that she'll be true. Look down! Look down! They've all forgotten you. When I get free, you won't see me here for dust! Look down! Look down! Dont look 'em in the eye. How long, oh Lord, before you let me die? Look down! Look down! You'll always be a slave. Look down! Look down! You're standing in your grave. Now bring me prisoner "24601". Your time is up and your parole's begun. - You know what that means? - Yes, it means I'm free! - No! It means you get your yellow ticket of leave. - You are a thief. - I stole a loaf of bread... - You robbed a house! - I broke a window pane. My sister's child was close to death and we were starving. - You will starve again unless you learn the meaning of the law. - I know the meaning of those 19 years, a slave of the law. Five years for what you did! The rest because you tried to run. Yes, "24601". My name is Jean Valjean! And I'm Javert! Do not forget my name! Do not forget me, "24601". Look down! Look down! You'll always be a slave. Look down! Look down! You're standing in your grave. Freedom is mine. The earth is still. I feel the wind. I breathe again and the sky clears. The world is waking. Drink from the pool. How clean the taste. Never forget the years, the waste. Nor forgive them for what they've done. They are the guilty - everyone. The day begins, and now let's see what this new world will do for me... You'll have to go! I'll pay you off for the day. Collect your bits and pieces there and be on your way. - You've given me half what the other men get. This handful of tin wouldn't buy my sweat! - You broke the law. It's there for people to see. Why should you get the same as honest men like me? And now I know how freedom feels, the jailer always at your heels, it is the law. This piece of paper in my hand that makes me cursed throughout the land, it is the law. Like a cur I walk the street... the dirt beneath their feet. Come in, sir, for you are weary. And the night is cold out there. Though our lives are very humble what we have we have to share. There is wine here to revive you. There is bread to make you strong. There's a bed to rest 'till morning, rest from pain and rest from wrong. He let me eat my fill, I had the lion's share. The silver in my hand cost twice what I had earned. In all those 19 years, that lifetime of despair - and yet he trusted me. The old fool trusted me, he'd done his bit of good. I played the grateful surf and thanked him like I should. But when the house was still I got up in the night... took the silver, took my flight! Tell His reverence your story, let us see if he's impressed. You were lodging here last night, you were the honest bishop's guest. And then out of Christian goodness, when learned about your plight... - You maintain he made a present of this silver. - That is right. But my friend, you left so early. Surely something slipped your mind? You forgot I gave these also, would you leave the best behind? So, monsieur, you may release him for this man has spoken true. I commend you for your duty and God's blessing go with you. But remember this, my brother. See in this some higher plan. You must use this precious silver to become an honest man. By the witness of the martyrs. By the passion and the blood. God hath raised you out of darkness. I have bought your soul for God. What have I done, sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night, become a dog on the run? Have I fallen so far and is the hour so late that nothing remains but the cry of my hate? The cries in the dark that nobody hears. Here where I stand at the turning of the years. If there's another way to go I missed it 20 long years ago. My life was a war that could never be won. They gave me a number - murded Valjean. When they chained me and left me for dead just for stealing a mouthful of bread. Yet why did I allow that man to touch my soul and teach me love? He treated me like any other. He gave me his trust, he called me brother. My life he claims for God above. Can such things be? For I had come to hate the world. This world that always hated me. Take and eye for an eye! Turn your heart into stone! This is all I have lived for. This is all I have known. One word from him and I'd be back beneath the lash, upon the rack. Instead he offers me my freedom. I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I had a soul. How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go? I am reaching but I fall and the night is closing in. As I stare into the void, to the whirlpool of my sin. I'll escape now from the world, from the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now. Another story must begin! [APPLAUSE] At the end of the day you're another day older. And that's all you can say for the life of the poor. It's a struggle, it's a war, and there's nothing that anyone's giving. One more day standing about, what is it for? One day less to be living. At the end of the day you're another day colder. And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill. And the righteous hurry past. They don't hear the little ones crying. And the winter is coming on fast, ready to kill. One day nearer to dying. At the end of the day there's another day dawning. And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise. Like the waves crash on the sand. Like a storm that'll break any second. There's a hunger in the land. There's a reckoning still to be reckoned. And there's gonna be hell to pay at the end of the day! . . . . And there's gonna be hell to pay at the end of the day! At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing. Sitting flat on your butt doesn't buy any bread. There are children back at home, and the children have got to be fed. - And you're lucky to be in a job... - And in a bed! And we're counting our blessings. Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today? With his terrible breath and his wandering hands? It's because little Fantine won't give him his way. Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands. At the end of the day it's another day over. With enough in your pocket to last for a week. Pay the landlord, pay the shop. Keep on grafting as long as you're able. Keep on grafting till you drop or it's back to the crumbs off the table. You've got to pay your way at the end of the day! And what have we here, little innocent sister? . . . . . . Come on, Fantine, let's have all the news. "Dear Fantine you must send us more money... Your child needs a doctor... There's no time to lose..." Give that letter to me, it is none of your business. With a husband at home and a bit on the side! Is there anyone here who can swear before God she has nothing to fear, she has nothing to hide? What is this fighting all about? Would someone tear these two apart? This is a factory, not a circus. Now, come on, ladies, settle down. I run a business of repute. I am the mayor of this town. I look to you to sort this out, and be as patient as you can. Now someone say how this began. At the end of the day she's the one who began it. There's a kid that she's hiding in some little town. There's a man she has to pay, and guess how she picks up the extra? You can bet she's earning her keep sleeping around. And the boss wouldn't like it. Yes, it's true, there's a child, and the child is my daughter. And her father abandoned us leaving us flat. Now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife and I pay for the child - what's the matter with that? At the end of the day she'll be nothing but trouble. And there's trouble for all when there's trouble for one! While we're earning our daily bread, she's the one with her hands in the butter You must send the slut away or we're all gonna end in the gutter And it's us who'll have to pay at the end of the day! I might have known the bitch could bite, I might have known the cat had claws... I might have guessed your little secret. Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine! Who keeps herself so pure and clean, you'd be the cause, I had no doubt... of any trouble hereabout. She'd play a virgin in the light but need no urgin' in the night. She's been laughing at you while she's having her men. (She'll be nothing but trouble again and again) You must sack her today. (Sack the girl today!) Right, my girl... on your way! There was a time when men were kind. And their voices were soft... and their words inviting. There was a time when love was blind, and the world was a song. And the song was exciting. There was a time when it all went wrong... I dreamed a dream in time gone by when hope was high and life worth living I dreamed that love would never die. I dreamed that God would be forgiving. Then I was young and unafraid. And dreams were made, and used, and wasted. There was no ransom to be paid. No song unsung, no wine untasted. But the tigers come at night... with their voices soft as thunder... as they tear your hope apart... as they turn your dream to shame. He slept a summer by my side. He filled my days with endless wonder. He took my childhood in his stride... but he was gone when autumn came. And still I dream he'll come to me. And we will live the years together. But there are dreams that cannot be. And there are storms we cannot weather. I had a dream my life would be so different from this hell I'm living. So different now from what it seemed... now life has killed the dream... I dreamed. [APPLAUSE] I smell women, smell 'em in the air! Think I'll drop my anchor in that harbour over there. Lovely ladies, smell 'em through the smoke. Seven days can make you hungry for a poke! Even stokers need a little stoke. Lovely ladies waiting for a bite. Waiting for the customers who only come at night. Lovely ladies ready for the call. Standing up or lying down or any way at all. Bargain prices up against the wall! What pretty hair... what pretty locks you've got there! What luck you've got... it's worth a centime, my dear. - I'll take the lot! - Don't touch me; leave me alone! - Let's make a price. I'll give you all of ten francs. - Just think of that... - It pays the debt. - Just think of that... - What can I do? It pays a debt, ten francs may save my poor Cosette. Old men, young men, take 'em as they come. Harbor rats and alley cats and every kind of scum. Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land. See them with their trousers off they're never quite as grand. All it takes is money in your hand! Lovely ladies going for a song . . . . . . Got a lot of callers but they never stay for long. Come on, captain, you can wear your shoes. Don't it make a change to have a girl who can't refuse? Easy money lying on a bed. Just as well they never see the hate that's in your head. Don't they know they're making love to one already dead? Here's something new. I think I'll give it a try. Come closer, you, I like to see what I buy. The usual price for just one slice of your pie. I don't want you, no no, monsieur, let me go. - Is this a trick? I won't pay more. - No, not at all. You've got some nerve, you little whore! You've got some gall. It's the same with a tart as it is with a grocer. The customer sees what he gets in advance. It's not for the whore to say"yes sir" or "no sir", it's not for the harlot to pick and to choose... or lead me to dance! I'll kill you, you bastard, try any of that! Even a whore who has gone to the bad won't be had by a rat. Tell me quickly, what's the story? Who saw what, and why, and where? Let him give a full description, let him answer to Javert. In this nest of whores and vipers let one speak who saw it all. Who laid hands on this good man here? What's the substance of this brawl? Javert, would you believe it? I was crossing from the park. When this prostitute attacked me, you can see she left her mark. She will answer for her actions when you make a full report. You may rest assured, monsieur, that she will answer to the court. There's a child who sorely needs me - please, monsieur, she's but that high. Holy God, is there no mercy? If I go to jail she'll die! I have heard such protestations every day for 20 years. Let's have no more explanations, save your breath and save your tears. Honest work, just reward - that's the way to please the Lord. A moment of your time, Javert, I do believe this woman's tale. But monsieur mayor - You've done your duty, let her be, she needs a doctor, not a jail. But monsieur mayor! - Can this be? - Where will she end? This child without a friend? I've seen your face before. Show me some way to help you. How have you come to grieve in such a place as this? Monsieur, don't mock me now, I pray. It's hard enough I've lost my pride. You let your foreman send me away. Yes, you were there and turned aside. - I never did no wrong. - Is it true what I've done? - My daughter's close to dying. - To an innocent son? - If there's a God above... - Had I only known then... - He'll let me die instead. In His name, my task has just begun. I will see it done. But monsieur mayor... I will see it done. But monsieur mayor! I will see it done! Can this be true? I don't believe what I see. A man your age to be as strong as you are. A memory stirs... you make me think of a man. From years ago... a man who broke his parole. He disappeared. Forgive me, sir, I would not dare. Say what you must. Don't leave it there. I have only known one other who can do what you have done. He's a convict from the chain gang, he's been ten years on the run. But he couldn't run forever. We have found his hideaway. And he's just been re-arrested, and he comes to court today. Well, of course, he now denies it. You'd expect that of a con. But he couldn't run forever, no, not even Jean Valjean. He thinks that man is me. He knew him at a glance. That stranger he has found - this man could be my chance. Why should I save his hide? Why should I right this wrong? When I have come so far and struggled for so long? If I speak I am condemned. If I stay silent I am damned. I am the master of hundreds of workers, they all look to me. Can I abandom them? How would they live if I am not free? If I speak I am condemned. If I stay silent I am damned. Who am I? Can I condemn this man to slavery? Pretend I do not see his agony? This innocent who bears my face, who goes to judgement in my place? Who am I? Can I conceal myself for evermore? Pretend I'm not the man I was before? Must my name until I die be no more than an alibi? Must I lie? How can I ever face my fellow men? How can I ever face myself again? My soul belongs to God, I know, I made that bargain long ago. He gave me hope when hope was gone, He gave me strength to journey on. Who am I? Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean! And so, Javert, you see it's true! This man bears no more guilt than you. Who am I? "24601" ! Cosette, it's turned so cold. Cosette, it's past your bedtime. You've played the day away. And soon it will be night. Come to me, Cosette, the light is fading. Don't you see the evening star appearing? Come to me, and rest against my shoulder. How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder. Hurry near, another day is dying. Don't you hear the winter wind is crying? There's a darkness which comes without a warning. But I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning. Oh Fantine, our time is running out. But Fantine, I swear this on my life. - Look, monsieur, where all the children play. - Be at peace. Be at peace evermore. - My Cosette... - Shall live for my protection. - Take her now. - Your child will want for nothing. Oh, monsieur, you come from God in heaven. And none will ever harm Cosette as long as I am living. Take my hand. - The night grows ever colder. - And I will keep you warm. Take my child, I give her to your keeping. Take shelter from the storm. For God's sake, please stay 'till I am sleeping. Tell Cosette I love her and I'll see her when I wake... Valjean, at last! We see each other plain. Monsieur, la m?re, you'll wear a different chain. Before you say another word, Javert... Before you chain me up like a slave again... Listen to me - there is something I must do. This woman leaves behind a suffering child. There is none but me who can intercede. In mercy's name, three days are all I need. Then I'll retire - I pledge my word. Then I'll retire. You must think me mad! I thought of you across the years. Men like you can never change. A man such as you. - Believe of me what you will. - Men like me can never change. - There is a duty that I'm sworn to do. - Men like you can never change. - You know nothing of my life. - No, "24601". - All I did was steal some bread. - My duties to the law... - You know nothing of the world. - You have no rights. - You would sooner see me dead. - Come with me, "24601". - But not before I see this justice done. - Now the wheel has turned around... - Jean Valjean is nothing now. - I am warning you, Javert! - Dare you talk to me of crime? - I am a stronger man by far! - And the price you had to pay? - There is power in me yet! - Every man is born in sin. - My race is not yet run. - Every man must choose his way. - I am warning you, Javert! - You know nothing of Javert! - There is nothing I won't dare. - I was born inside a jail. - If I have to kill you here... - I was born with scum like you! - I'll do what must be done. - I am from the gutter, too. [TO FANTINE] I shall swear to you tonight. [TO VALJEAN] There is no place for you to hide. - Your child will live within my care. - Wherever you may hide away... - And I will raise her to the light. [BOTH] I swear to you, I will be there. There is a castle on a cloud. I like to go there in my sleep. Aren't any floors for me to sweep. Not in my castle on a cloud. There is a room that's full of toys. There are 100 boys and girls. Nobody shouts or talks too loud. Not in my castle on a cloud. There is a lady all in white. Holds me and sings a lullabye. She's nice to see and she's soft to touch. She says "Cosette, I love you very much." I know a place where no-one's lost. I know a place where no-one cries. Crying at all is not allowed. Not in my castle on a cloud. Oh help! I think I hear them now. And I'm nowhere near finished sweeping, scrubbing and polishing the floors. Oh, it's her! It's madame! Now look who's here! [AUDIENCE LAUGH] The little madam herself. Pretending once again she's been so awfully good. Better not let me catch you slacking. Better not catch my eye! Ten rotten francs your mother sends me. What's that going to buy? Now take that pale, my little madamoiselle. And go and draw some water from the well. We should never have taken you in in the first place. How stupid the things we do. Like mother, like daughter, the scum of the street! Still there, Cosette? Yours tears will do you no good. I told you, fetch some watch from the well in the wood. Please do not send me out alone. - Not in the darkness on my own... - Enough of that! Or I'll "forget" to be nice! [AUDIENCE LAUGH] You heard me ask for something and I never ask twice.s Welcome, monsieur. Sit yourself down. And meet the best inkeeper in town. As for the rest, all of them crooks. Rooking the guests and cooking the books. Seldom do you see honest men like me. A gent of good intent who's content to be... Master of the house. Doling out the charm. Ready with a handshake and an open palm. Tells a saucy tale, makes a little stir. Customers appreciate a bon-viveur. Glad to do my friends a favour. Doesn't cost me to be nice. But nothing gets you nothing; everything has got a little price. Master of the house, keeper of the zoo. Ready to relieve them of a sou or two. Watering the wine, making up the weight. Picking up their knick-knacks when they can't see straight. Everybody loves the landlord. Everybody's bosom friend. I do whatever pleases, Jesus, won't I bleed 'em in the end! Master of the house, quick to catch your eye. Never wants a passer-by to pass him by. Servant to the poor. Butler to the great. Comforter, philosopher and lifelong mate. Everybody's true companion. Everybody's chaperone. But lock up your valises. Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone! Enter, monsieur, lay down your load. Unlace your boots and rest from the road. This weighs a tonne, travel's a curse. Here we strive to lighten your purse. Here the goose is cooked. Here the fat is fried. And nothing's overlooked 'till I'm satisfied. Food beyond compare. Food beyond belief. Mix it in a mince and pretend it's beef. Kidney of a horse, liver of a cat. Fillin' up the sausages with this and that. Residents are more than welcome. Bridal suite is occupied (hmm!) Reasonable charges plus some little extras on the side. Charging for the lice, extra for the mice. Two percent for looking in the mirror twice. Here a little slice, there a little cut. Three percent for sleeping with the window shut. When it comes to fixing prices, there are lots of tricks he knows. How it all increases, all them bits and pieces. Jesus! It's amazing how it grows. Master of the house, quick to catch your eye. Never wants a passer-by to pass him by. Servant to the poor, Butler to the great. Comforter, philosopher and lifelong mate. Everybody's true companion. Give's them everything he's got. Dirty bunch of geezers, Jesus! What a sorry little lot. I used to dream that I would meet a prince. But God Almighty, have you seen what's happened since? Master of the house isn't worth my spit. Comforter, philosopher and lifelong shit. Cunning little brain, regular voltaire. Thinks he's quite a lover but there's (not much there). What a cruel trick of nature landing me with such a louse. God knows how I've lasted living with this bastard in the house! Master of the house. (Master and a half!) Comforter, philosopher - (Don't make me laugh!) Servant to the poor. Butler to the great. Hypocrite and toady and inebriate! Everybody bless the landlord! Everybody bless his spouse! Everybody raise a glass! Raise it up the master's arse! Everybody raise a glass to the master of the house. [APPLAUSE] [SILENCED CONVERSATION] [APPLAUSE CONTINUTES] I found her wandering in the wood. This little child, I found her trembling in the shadows. . . . . And I am here to help Cosette, and I will settle any debt you may think proper. I will pay what I must pay to take Cosette away. What to do? What to say? Shall you carry our treasure away? What a gem, what a pearl. Beyond rubies is our little girl. How can we speak of debt? Let's not haggle for darling Cosette. Dear Fantine, gone to rest. Have we done for your child what is best? Shared our bread. Shared each bone. Treated her like she's one of our own. Like our own, monsieur! [AUDIENCE LAUGH] Your feelings do you credit, sir. And I will ease the parting blow. Let us not talk of bargains or bones or greed. Now, may I say, we are agreed? That would quite fit the bill if she hadn't so often been ill. Little dear cost us dear... medicines are expensive, monsieur. Not that we'd begrudge a sou. It's no more than we Christians must do. One thing more, one small doubt. There are treacherous people about. No offence, please reflect: your intentions may not be correct. No more words. Here's your price. 15 hundred for your sacrifice. Come, Cosette. Say goodbye. Let us seek out a friendlier sky. Thank you both for Cosette. It won't take you too long to forget. Look down and see the beggars at your feet. Look down and show some mercy if you can. Look down and see the sweepings of the street. Look down, look down upon your fellow man. How do ya do? My name's Gavroche. These are my people, here's my patch. Not much to look at, nothing posh. Nothing that you'd call up to scratch. This is my school, my high society. Here in the slums of Saint Michele. We live on crumbs of humble piety. Tough on the teeth, but what the hell? Think you're poor? Think you're free? Follow me. Follow me! Look down and show some mercy if you can/ Look down, look down upon your fellow man. What d'you think you're at? Hanging round my pitch? If you're new around here, girl, you've got a lot to learn. Listen, you old bat. Crazy bloody witch! Least I give my customers some pleasure in return. I know what you give! You give them all the pox! Spread around your poison 'till they end up in a box. Leave the poor old cow. Move it, Madeleine. She used to be no better 'till the clap got to her brain. When's it gonna end? When we gonna live? Something's gotta happen now or something's gonna give. It'll come, it'll come, it'll come... Where are the leaders of the land? Where are the swells who run this show? Only one man, and that's Lamarque. Speaks for the people here below. See our children fed. Help us in our shame. Something for a crust of bread. In Holy Jesus' name. In the Lord's Holy name. In his name, in his name... Lamarque is ill and fading fast. Won't last the week out, so they say. With all the anger in the land... how long before the judgement day? Before we cut the fat ones down to size? Before the barricades arise? Look down and show some mercy if you can. Look down, look down upon your fellow man. There... out in the darkness... a fugitive running, fallen from God. Fallen from grace. God be my witness. I never shall yield 'till we come face to face. 'Till we come face to face. He knows his way in the dark. Mine is the way of the Lord. Those who follow the path of the righteous shall have their reward. And if they fall as Lucifer fell... The flame, the sword... Stars... in your multitudes... Scare to be counted. Filling the darkness. With order and light. You are the sentinels. Silent and sure. Keeping watch in the night. Keeping watch in the night. You know your place in the sky. You hold your course and your aim. And each in your season returns and returns. And is always the same. And if you fall as Lucifer fell... you fall in vain. And so it must be! For so it is written. On the doorway to paradise. That those who falter and those who fall... must pay the price. Lord, let me find him. That I may see him... safe behind bars! I will never rest. 'Till then this I swear. This I swear by the stars! [APPLAUSE] At Notre Dame the sections are prepared! At rue de Bac they're straining at the leash! Students, workers, everyone. There's a river on the run. Like the flowing of the tide, Paris coming to our side! The time is near. So near it's stirring the blood in their veins. And yet beware. Don't let the wine go to your brains. For the army we fight is a dangerous foe. With the men and the arms that we never could match. Oh, it's easy to sit here and swat 'em like flies. But the national guard will be harder to catch. We need a sign to rally the people, to call them to arms. To bring them in line. - Marius, you're late. - What's wrong today? You look as if you've seen a ghost. A ghost you say... a ghost maybe. She was just like a ghost to me. One minute there, then she was gone! I am agog! I am aghast! Is Marius in love at last? I've never seen him "ooh" and "aah". You talk of battles to be won. And here he comes like Don Juan. It's better than an opera. It is time for us all to decide who we are. Do we fight for the right to a night at the opera now? Have you asked of yourselves what's the price you might pay? Is it simply a game for rich young boys to play? The color of the world is changing day by day... Red, the blood of angry men. Black, the dark of ages past. Red, a world abou to dawn. Black, the night that ends at last. Had you been there tonight you might know how it feels To be struck to the bone in a moment of breathless delight. Had you been there tonight you might also have known... How the world may be changed in just one burst of light! And what was right seems wrong. And what was wrong seems right. - Red. - I feel my soul on fire. - Black. - My world if she's not there. - Red. - The colour of desire. - Black. - The colour of despair. Marius, you're no longer a child. I do not doubt you mean it well. But now there is a higher call. Who cares about your lonely soul? We strive towards a larger goal. Our little lives don't count at all. Red, the blood of angry men. Black, the dawn of ages past. Red, a world about to dawn. Black, the night that ends at last. [APPLAUSE] Well, Courfeyrac, do we have all the guns? Feuilly, Combeferre, our time is running short. Grantaire, put the bottle down! Do we have the guns we need? Give me brandy on my breath And I'll breathe them all to death! In St. Antoine they're with us to a man! In Notre Dame they're tearing up the stones! - Twenty rifles good as new. - Listen! - Twenty rounds for every man. - Listen to me! - Double that in Port St. Cloud! - Listen everybody! - Seven guns in St. Martin! General Lamarque is dead. Lamarque is dead. Lamarque, his death is the hour of fate. The people's man. His death is the sign we await! On his funeral day they will honor his name. It's a rallying cry that will reach every ear! In the death of Lamarque we will kindle the flame. They will see that the day of salvation is near. The time is here. Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer Let us take to the streets with no doubt in our hearts. But a jubilant shout, they will come one and all. They will come when we call! Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men? It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again. When the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums. There is a life about to start when tomorrow comes. Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me? Beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see? Then join the fight that will give you the right to be free. Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men? It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again. When the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums. There is a life about to start when tomorrow comes. Will you give all you can give so that our banner may advance? Some will fall and some will live. Will you stand up and take your chance? The blood of the martyrs will water the meadows of France. Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men? It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again. When the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums. There is a life about to start when tomorrow comes. How strange this feeling that my life's begun at last. This change... can people really fall in love so fast? What's the matter with you, Cosette? Have you been too much on your own? So many things unclear. So many things unknown. In my life there are so many questions and answers... that somehow seem wrong. In my life... there are times when I catch in the silence the sigh of a far away song. And it sings of a world that I long to see... out of reach, just a whisper away... waiting for me! Does he know I'm alive? Do I know if he's real? Did he see what I saw? Does he feel what I feel? In my life I'm no longer alone now the love in my life is so near. Find me now. Find me here. In my life she has burst like the music of angels... the light of the sun. And my life seems to stop as if something is over and something has scarcely begun. Eponine... You're the friend who has brought me here. Thanks to you... I am one with the gods and heaven is near. And I soar through a world that is new, that is green. Every word that he says is a dagger in me. In my life there's been no-one like him anywhere... anywhere where he is. If he asked, I'd be his. [BOTH] In my life... There is someone who touches my life. - Waiting near. - Waiting here. A heart full of love. A heart full of song. I'm doing everything all wrong! Oh, God, for shame. I do not even know your name. Dear madamoiselle, won't you say? Will you tell? - A heart full of love. No fear, no regret. - My name is Marius Pontmercy. Cosette, I don't know what to say. - Then make no sound. - I am lost... - I am found. - A heart full of life... [BOTH] A night bright as day. - You must never go away. - Cosette, Cosette! - This is a chain we'll never break. - Do I dream? - I'm awake. - A heart full of love. [EPONINE] He was never mine to lose. [MARIUS/COSETTE] A heart full of you. [MARIUS/EPONINE] - One single look and then I knew... - Why regret what cannot be? [COSETTE/EPONINE] - I knew it too! - These are words he'll never say. - Not to me. - From today. - Not to me, not for me. Every day... [COSETTE/MARIUS] - For it isn't a dream. [EPONINE] - His heart full of love. [COSETTE/MARIUS] - Not a dream after all. [EPONINE] - He will never feel this way... [APPLAUSE] This is his lair, I've seen the old fox around. He keeps himself to himself, he's staying close to the ground. I smell profit here! Ten years ago he came and paid for Cosette. I let her go for a song, it's time we settled the debt. This'll cost him dear. What do I care who you should rob? Give me my share, finish the job. You shut your mouth, give me your hands. What have we here? Who is this hussy? It's your brat, Eponine, don't you know your own kid? Why's she hanging about you? Eponine, get on home, you're not needed in this. We're enough here without you. I know this house, I tell you there's nothing here for you. Just the old man and the girl. They live ordinary lives. Don't interfere, you've got some gall. Take care, young miss, you've got a lot to say. She's going soft. Happens to all. Go home, 'Ponine. Go home, you're in the way. I'm gonna scream. I'm gonna warn them here. One little scream and you'll regret it for a year. What a palaver, what an absolute treat. To watch a cat and its father pick a bone in the street. Not a sound out of you! Well I told you I'd do it, I told you I'd do it. [SCREAMS] You wait, my girl. You'll rue this night. I'll make you scream. You'll scream, all right. Leave her to me. Don't wait around. Make for the sewers, go underground. It was your cry sent them away. Once more 'Ponine saving the day. Dearest Cosette - my friend 'Ponine. Brought me to you, showed me the way! Somebody's near - let's not be seen. Somebody's near. My God, Cosette! I heard a cry in the dark. I heard the shout of angry voices in the street. That was my cry you heard, Papa. I was afraid of what they'd do. They ran away when they heard my cry. Cosette, my child, what will become of you? Three men I saw beyond the wall. Three men in shadow moving fast. This is a warning to us all. These are the shadows of the past. It must be Javert! He's found my cover at last. I've got to get Cosette away before they return. We must get away from shadows. They will never let us be here. Tomorrow to Calais... And then a ship across the sea! Hurry, Cosette, prepare to leave and say no more, tomorrow we'll away! Hurry, Cosette, it's time to close another door and live another day! One day more. Another day, another destiny. This never-ending road to Calvary. These men who seem to know my crime will surely come a second time. - One day more. - I did not live until today. How can I live when we are parting? - One day more. Tomorrow you'll be worlds away. And yet with you my world has started. - One more day I'm on my own. - Will we ever meet again? - One more day with him not caring. - I was born to be with you. - What a life I might have known. - And I swear I will be true. - But he never saw me there. - One more day before the storm! - Do I follow where she goes? - At the barricades of freedom. - Shall I join my brothers there? - When our ranks begin to form. - Do I stay and do I dare? - Will you take your place with me? [ALL] The time is now - the day is here. [VALJEAN/JAVERT] - One day more! - One more day to revolution. We will nip it in the bud. I will join these little schoolboys. They will wet themselves with blood. - One day more. - Watch 'em run amuck, catch 'em as they fall. Never know your luck when there's a free for all. Here a little dip, there a little touch. Most of them are goners so they won't miss much! [STUDENTS] - One day to a new beginning. - Raise the flag of freedom high. - Every man will be a king. - Every man will be a king. - There's a new world for the winning. - There's a new world to be won. [ALL] Do you hear the people sing? [MARIUS] My place is here, I fight with you! - One day more! [MARIUS/COSETTE] I did not live until today. [EPONINE] One more day all on my own! [MARIUS/COSETTE] How can I live when we are parted? - One day more! [MARIUS/COSETTE] Tomorrow you'll be worlds away. [EPONINE] What a world I might have known! [MARIUS/COSETTE] And yet with you my world has started. [VALJEAN] Tomorrow we'll be far away. Tomorrow is the judgement day. [ALL] Tomorrow we'll discover what our God in heaven has in store! One more dawn. One more day. One day more! [APPLAUSE]
