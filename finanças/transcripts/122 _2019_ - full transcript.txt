Omneya. Omneya. Can't you hear me? Are you done? Not yet. Didn't you hear him or are you playing deaf? It's my hearing aid. I can't hear well, but I can understand. Omneya. Omneya. Can you hear me? Do I always have to worry about you? Sorry. The clients are waiting outside. All right, all right. That bastard Said just left the shop like a trash dump to get back at me because he took my shift yesterday. I didn't tell him what happened. He might've thought I wanted his pity. Anyway, I cleaned up the shop and everything is in order, just to get them off my back. Listen. I'll drop by at 3:00. I have something important to tell you. Don't be stupid. I know how you get when you're mad. Wait for me. I'll call you back, bye. -Welcome, sir. -Hello. This is our new collection, and this row here is on sale. -Is this the discount price? -Not yet, sir. These are American, 1,200 before discount, 600 after. That's 50 percent off, sir. We have an Italian brand for 750-- No, thanks. That's before the discount, sir. What are you doing? I'm trying to get some signal so I can video call you. I brought you something. You didn't eat your pastries yesterday. I don't want any. Cheer up, or I'll smack your face. Come on, Omneya. Chocolate. I know, I brought it especially for you. Let's find a place to sit. Let's go find a place to sit. Eat. I'm eating. Omneya. You know my situation since my dad died, how my mom and I struggled to pay for my sister's wedding. -What happened yesterday was-- -Your mother was rude. Don't mind what she says. You know my mom loves you. -She just-- -She sees me as handicapped. You're not handicapped, you're beautiful. Look at me, forget what she said. Besides, your mom was wrong too. If I had known that it was a trap, I wouldn't have brought my mom unprepared. I didn't lie to you. You know I can't afford to pay for a full wedding. You manage the accounts and write everything down. All I have is 12,300, right? Or is there something I don't know? Right. But I have an idea. A good one. What will you do? What? Go work abroad and leave me? What, Nasr? A friend will invest the money in a job, and then we can get married. Don't tell me it's Shiko. You want to use the money to buy drugs? You promised not to go down that route again. It's the only way, so we can get married and satisfy your mom. No. I love you, Omneya. I won't leave you. God will be with us and it'll go well. I know I promised you. I'd never break a promise, but this is the last time. One last time to solve all our problems. I've agreed with Shiko to make the trip tomorrow to gain some time. Just keep your mom calm and patient till I get back. Understand? DON'T RISK YOUR LIFE FOR ME. IT'S OKAY. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRONG. IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE MAKING ME MAD WITH "IT'S OKAY." ARE YOU MAD AT ME, NASR? Are you crazy? I've been knocking for a while. You turned off that thing. It whistles and it bothers me. Get it fixed and stop acting silly. Can you hear me? Mom acted that way on purpose yesterday to drive the guy away. Thankfully it didn't work. You won't find anyone who loves you more than Nasr. Is that so? How come? Don't you see how he looks at you? It's like you have him bewitched. He learned sign language for you, and we never did. He'll hate me. Idiot. He's crazy about you. I know. I stopped dealing for you, Omneya. But there's no other way. The whole thing will take half a day. I'll get it done and we'll get married. Nobody will find out. I love you. I love the baby you're carrying, and I won't leave you. God won't forsake us. -Did you two make up? -Turn the lights off. What did he say to you? None of your business. What? Give me that phone. -Give it to me! -Stop it. What a pest! Well, what matters is that you made up. IF YOU INSIST, THEN I'M GOING WITH YOU. THE THREE OF US. Right. I'll make the pickup, deliver the goods, and return with the money. Yes, I have the address. Don't worry, Shiko. Great, Shiko. Bless you. What is it? Didn't I take the license from Shiko? I saw you take it. For goodness' sake... Oh, here it is. Shall I keep it with me? I'll keep it here in case there's a checkpoint. You have our marriage certificate? Right. Nasr, are you okay? Shiko said he overhauled the car and that it's fine. God willing, all will go well. I'm just waiting for a signal so I can find the road entrance. Peace be upon you. Peace and blessings. Looking for the highway? Yes, the entrance. At the end of the road, go left, you will see a plaza with a sign. Shall we take this highway? I don't know. It's a good road. They're going to build a hospital and a gas station. Bless you. What a depressing road. But shorter. GPS shows it'll save us about 20 minutes. Nice. Let's see what this guy listens to. Be coquettish, pretty one By God, Shiko has taste. My uncle had this music and nothing else. He'd always play it in his cab. Is your hearing aid whistling? A little. I'll turn it off. No, no, it's okay. I'm not going to listen alone. -It's okay, Nasr. -Okay. Look, look! What a sweetie! He is waving at you, Nasr. There's a guy on the road. Help me carry him. Excuse me. -Get these tests done. -X-ray room, quick! -Yes, Doctor. -Get him to any vacant bed. -Doctor Mohamed... -Yes? No time to talk now. Go check that patient. -Let's go, Ragaa. -Yes, Doctor. You're doing fine. Why so anxious? Just rest till I examine you. What's your name? Where's Nasr? -What? -Where's my husband, Nasr? I'm deaf. I want a hearing aid. You use a hearing aid. Wait here. I'll be right back. -Who gathered the stuff from the accident? -Just a second, Doctor. Somebody answer me. What are you doing, Doctor? Preparing the medication for patient four. -Did you check their blood pressure? -Right away. -Bring that stuff and follow me. -As you wish. What are you doing here? Wait, calm down. I'll get you what you need, just a second. Where's the stuff from the accident? Dr. Nabil's looking for it. She'll help you. Go to her. Look after her, Samar, she's deaf. Put it in an IV fluid, but be sure to check his blood pressure. She needs her hearing aid. Take care of it, Mohamed. I'll see to it personally, Doctor. Where's Nasr? Where's my husband? Is he okay? Dr. Mohamed will see to everything you need. Nasr Abdel Rahman. Where's my husband, Nasr Abdel Rahman? Is he okay? -Calm down. What's your name? -Omneya. Okay, Omneya. Can we go find your hearing aid first? Come. Come, Omneya. Don't worry. Come with me. PROPERTIES Are those your things? You got anything to prove that? I'm talking to you! Can you hear me? I hear you. Sign for your belongings. Where are Nasr's things? Do you know where he is? What's wrong? I'm pregnant. I want to make sure my child is okay. Omneya. Omneya. Omneya. Are you and Nasr legally married? Your ID says you're single. We're married. Does he know you're pregnant? I can't let you leave without checking on the baby. Have you eaten anything? Samar. Bring her some juice from my fridge. Yes, Doctor. I don't have an ultrasound here, but we can keep you under observation, check your blood pressure, give you an injection to stabilize the pregnancy. I'm fine. I want to know if Nasr is okay. We called all hospitals within the vicinity of the accident. Nobody fitting Nasr's description was admitted. He may have found a ride and gone home. You were trying to call him. Is his phone working? Strange, he's not answering. Are you coming with us? There's a car outside. If you want to stay here so we can observe you, you're welcome to. There'll be no other cars until the morning shift. If you want to go home, leave your number, and if we get any news I'll let you know, okay? Yes. I have work. Two corneas and a liver. I have to hang up now. Bye. What a time to get something in my eye. -Hello. -This is the police. Go ahead. I don't know where I am, officer, but it's somewhere like a morgue. -What's your full name? -Nasr Abdel Rahman Zeidan. Is this a morgue in some hospital? I don't know if it's a hospital or what. But I'm going to get killed. ID number? What ID number? I don't know it by heart. Are you calling from your phone? No, this isn't my phone. 011434 Nobody there with that description. Where could he be? Give yourself a break, Samir. Aren't you tired? Wait. Yes, I can hear you. Name: Nasr Abdel Rahman Zeidan. Age: 29. Yes, please. He'll ask and get back to us. That's enough. We don't even know her, why are you doing all this? She needs help. Don't be like that, take it easy on her. Did he say something? All right. I'm with you, Doctor. THIS IS NASR. I'M LOCKED UP IN A HOSPITAL MORGUE. CALL THE POLICE BEFORE THEY KILL ME. AL-HAYAT HOSPITAL AL-HAYAT HOSPITAL 4 KM Good evening, Ola. I hear you need money, so I thought I could... Please don't call me again. I want to see Karim, my son. Come to court and you'll see him. What court? You... I'm sorry, please forgive me. I'm... Dr. Nabil, I need your opinion on something. He was there for four hours and you didn't know he was alive? I didn't notice. I haven't slept since yesterday. I had work. You didn't notice? This guy will wake up soon and he will expose us. I want anesthesia. Anesthesia. Give him this injection. I'll get the car and be back. We'll take what we need then get rid of him somewhere. He's just come out of a coma. With that injection, he could die in our hands. What? Has your conscience suddenly awakened? A report? What report, sir? Yes, I'm the owner of this phone. I apologize, officer. The kids were playing with the phone. I'm Dr. Amgad Ismail Fikry, a physician. My apologies, officer. Goodbye. When were you gonna tell me about this? I was afraid you'd do something we'd both regret. The guy knows who you are, where you work, and your number. What will your mother do if you're exposed? And Rana, your fianc√©e? Please, Amgad. Don't make a terrible mistake. Give him the injection. Yes, Doctor. I won't be long. I'll get the car and be right back. I'm alive. My wife is pregnant and I want to see my child. I won't say anything, I swear to God. Here. What are you doing, Amgad? I will not take part in this, Doctor. This person's still alive. Let him go. He promised that if we let him go, he won't talk. Really? I'm not convinced. So, what am I supposed to do? Do what you want, but this time you're going to listen to me. Don't be stupid, give me that thing. Nasr. Nasr! LAUNDRY Come out, Nasr. None of this is your fault. You said you wouldn't go to the police. What are you afraid of? Nasr, come out. I'll get you Amgad. I know you trust him. Nasr, you have a very serious wound. It needs to be cleaned or... What is it? Did you forget something? The phone will charge, don't worry. I want to go to the morgue. We don't have a morgue here. We don't have a morgue. The hospital is new, as you can see. Until the equipment arrives, we just have the ER. -Where's Ragaa? -Sleeping upstairs. Can you call the police? My phone's being charged. If your phone's working, I'll call them. Come with me and see for yourself if there's a morgue or not. If it were up to me, I'd let you live in that pipe forever. But sadly, we're running out of time. Don't be angry with Samar. This place is depressing. We're all fed up and exhausted. What is it, Omneya? Can you hear me? What happened? Omneya, can you hear me? No. Omneya... Omneya. Omneya! Omneya! What's that? Omneya! No! Samar. Dr. Nabil. What is it? I thought I heard something. Are you okay? What's that woman doing here with you? I was just helping her. Is that so? Do you take me for a fool? I felt sorry for her, that's all. Sure. So you brought her to spend the night with you. You've got it wrong, Doctor. Go. God knows how this shitty night's going to end. I promised to show her the lower floor. She thinks her husband's down there. You don't say. I thought I'd take her down to ease her mind. I'll take her home tomorrow. Yes, you're right. I have to go. We'll leave right now. -Come on, Omneya. -Doctor. Go. Didn't you want to take her downstairs? Go. Come on, it'll put your mind at ease too. Go. What's wrong? All right then. Come. Don't be afraid. Come on. It's okay. Calm down, now. What's wrong? Tell me. What happened? What happened? The doctor killed Mohamed. Which doctor killed who? What are you talking about? I saw Mohamed die in front of me. Don't scare me. Where's Mohamed? How did he die? That doctor, the one called Nabil, killed him. Quick, call the police before he finds us! All right, there. Hello? Police? We're being held at Al-Hayat Hospital. Someone's trying to kill us. Yes. We've locked ourselves in a room. Keep her with you and don't talk. Keep her locked in, understood? Okay, we'll do exactly that. Hurry up then. We won't move till you get here. The officer says to lock ourselves in here till they arrive. How long? Let's say about half an hour. DR. NABIL TAREK - CARE It was nice of you to check on us, locked up on our own like this. -Is the chief with you? -Yes, he's in the car. Evening, sir. Hello, Doctor. Aren't you working today? As usual, sir, delaying us for nothing. Good. Come with us then. -Where to? -The station. What for, sir? Got some men that need to be checked for food poisoning. There's nothing I can do for them at the station. -Shall I bring them here? -No. We're not equipped to do stomach pumping. What can you do then? I'll get some medication from the pharmacy. Pills and injections. -Will that work? -Definitely. Awad, go with the doctor and get the medicine. Yes, sir. On second thought, wait. I'll go with you. What's this? Why are you in such a mess, Doctor? We've had a really tough day. This way, sir. What do you mean by tough? -Here you go, sir. -Thanks. Two tablets of this and two of this. If that doesn't work, their stomachs must be pumped. You said there were injections? I couldn't find any, but it won't do anything extra. Got a clean bathroom here? Yes, sir. This way. This way, sir. You look exhausted, Doctor. It's been a really tough day. People came to fight, not to get treatment. You're not alone. It's the same with us. We've had a hell of a day. Excellent decision by the referee. What's that sound? Is anyone here? Probably a colleague. They have their own rooms. -Who's in that room? -A nurse colleague. She must be asleep now. It's been a really tough day. Shall I wake her? No, there's no need. ...the ninth championship and the winner of the title... Thank God. Are you okay? I can't hear. I can't hear! It's okay. I'm with you, don't be afraid. We have to get out of here now. Let's go, don't be afraid. We have to leave before he finds us. I'm fine, really. It's nothing, Omneya. Don't be scared. We have to think fast before he gets here. The entrance door. The one downstairs? -In the drawer, there's a key. -A key. -The key is in the drawer. -It's in the drawer. Wait here, I'll go get it and come back. No, don't leave me, Nasr! Don't-- Keep quiet. There's no time. Do as I say. I'll go get the key. Don't leave this room. I'll be back. Don't move, Omneya. Stay here. Nasr! Keep hiding like a woman. Your end is near either way. Nasr! I told you to stay there. You stay here. Tell me the minute the light goes out. You're holding onto life! This is a nice game, Nasr. But I have a better one. This time you can't come with me. Wait here. I'll go downstairs. I'll get the key. I'll be back and we'll get out of here. Take this. Go over there. Five minutes. You do what I just did. I'll show you why I am holding onto life! Come here! Samar! Dr. Mohamed! Samar! -Dr. Nabil. -What? What's going on here? I don't know. Where's everyone else? We'll find them. Don't worry, I'm with you. Thank God. Thank God you weren't harmed. What's going on in the hospital? Two crazy people killed Samar and Mohamed, and injured the rest. Killed Samar and Mohamed? Let's call the police. I did. They're on their way. I need you with me so we can avenge our colleagues. -What're you doing, Ragaa? -Calling my mom. Not now, Ragaa. Calm down. Not now. Hello? Hello, Ragaa? Omneya. Omneya! Ragaa, what's that noise? Answer me. Ragaa? Get up! Let Nasr help you now! Nasr, that's enough! Enough, enough! I want to get out of here. We will, Omneya. Omneya, come on. Nasr. Nasr. Nasr, are you okay? Nasr! Nasr! Nasr! Nasr. Nasr. Nasr. Nasr. Nasr. Nasr. Nasr. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Nasr, don't leave me. Nasr, don't leave me. Please, please, don't leave me. Please. Nasr. Nasr. I'll go get someone. Wait for me. Wait for me. -What did he do? -He's laughing. Let me ask about that guy. Why? He's been after you for days. If he knows I'm deaf, he'll stay away. Wait. You're burning! No, no. I'm so stupid. You're sweet... and very pretty! I... love you. I'm scared... that... I'm pregnant. Pregnant? I wish! Yes. We did nothing wrong or sinful. You're legally my wife. Why did you stop? Omneya. Omneya. Is she alive? Omneya, where's Nasr? Where's Nasr? Didn't you shoot him? Maybe he bled to death. Maybe. Come with me. What are you doing, Emad? I want to find that guy. We deserve him. Give me a hand before somebody comes. The gun's empty. It's useless. Let's go, Emad. -You came quickly. -I have to leave right away. No problem. What? What is it? Give me what you've got or slice up that girl, and let me sell her organs as a severance bonus. You think the guys will let you sell behind their backs? None of your business. -This isn't the time. -No, it is. We have time before the morning shift. Just get to work, and I'll drive you to the airport myself. Be sensible, Doctor. Don't upset me. Let's part as friends. All right, Emad. -We've got age and blood type, right? -Yes. Yeah, I've taken care of it. None of your business how. I have a clever doctor. I'll get you what you want. I'll send you the age and blood type. I'll call you. But I want cash, so don't mess around with me. All right. Bye. Hello, hello. This is an honor. What did you gain by ruining it for everybody? This poor girl will die because of you. What did she do? You should have done it and we'd all be done by now. Keep Omneya out of this. Let her go. We don't want anything from you. "We don't want..." Why do you keep holding onto life? Do you love him? How long will you endure? A year, two, ten? And then? Omneya. I promised I'd never leave you, no matter what. Subtitle translation by Radwa Ashraf
