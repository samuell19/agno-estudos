♪ ♪ And with the industrialrevolution came millionaires who'd compete to throwthe most lavish parties and they'd try to out-doone another with their big dessertsor their huge hats. They'd even compete to see who could have the mostmagnificent mansions. One man plated his entirebathtub in 24-karat gold leaf. Imagine taking a bubble bathin that. But miss, aren't placeslike that just in fairy tales? Oh, no. No, they're very real.Trust me. In fact, I used to spendmy summers in a big mansion just like thatwhen I was your age. Well, back in the States. Lucy? Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. Enjoy the rest of your tour. Lucy, giving children toursin the galleries again? That's what our docentsare for. Sorry, Isabelle. I was just passing throughand I guess I got pulled in. I love that exhibit. Come along. I need my director ofdevelopment upstairs. We've got to plan forthe fundraiser tonight. So catch me up where we are. Sure. So I re-workedthe seating chart. All of our major donorswill be sitting up front, and you will be between the LordMayor and Ambassador Philips. Oh, Lucy. You remind me of me. Museum directors aren't made,they're born. And you truly have the makingsof one of the greats. You know, I'm relocating backto New York soon. I can't think of anyonewho works harder than you. Thank you. Your passion and knowledgeof history is undeniable. Your organizational skillsare top-notch. Well, I've decided to nominateyou as my replacement when I retire next month. Isabelle. Really? Oh my gosh, that would bea dream come true. But before we pop the champagne,just one more hurdle. I do need to get the trusteeson board with you first. I will wear them down like... Like... like the Dukeof Wellington wore down Napoleon at Waterloo. Precisely. [laughs] Ok. Name tags done,catering taken care of, Isabelle's speech printedand proofed. I don't think Hannibal had thismuch to do crossing the Alps. [laughs] Anything else, Josephine? Uh, that just about does it. I'd say we're ready forthe fundraiser tonight. Well then, since the newexhibit's going in downstairs, I might just sneak downfor an early peek. Boss, you're meeting the HobartFoundation at 2:00 and then Lady Jacobs to naildown her gift for the east wing, and you still have to call backthat cute Cambridge professor that wants to take you outon a date. He didn't want to take meout on a date. He just wants my help writinghis grant proposal. Lucy, you're a victimof your own success. Well, I should take these downto the archives. Oh! I got it. And, uh, cover for meif anyone asks? Have fun. Enjoy the new exhibit. Oops, sorry. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. Is this rubbishyou're throwing out? Hey. That I am, why? This pot right here is actuallyDelft pottery. It's a real treasure. You might wanna hang on to it. I had no idea.Thank you. You're welcome. Take good care of it. Hi, Nigel. Did you have a good day? Great, Lucy. Oh, this came for you. Special delivery. All the way from the U. S. of A.Looks official. H.K. Rourke,Attorney at Law. "Lucy Windsor, I've been tryingto reach you "since your great aunt... This can't be. [knocking] Lucy, I'm so sorry to hearabout your aunt. Thanks, Isabelle. She was a wonderful lady. She passed away last month. Oh, is that her? Yes. Aunt Grace. The kindest, most adventuroussoul you could ever meet. Wow, what a lovely estate. I'd guess Gilded Age Era. Upstate New York? Close, Rhode Island.It's called Wycliffe House. I grew up spendingmy summers there. Your Aunt lived there. Great Aunt, actually. Her husband Arthur wasthe last of the Wycliff's. His grandfather Henry builtthe house over 100 years ago. I spoke to my folks and theysaid that Arthur didn't have any remaining family so Aunt Grace bequeathedthe whole thing to me. Inheriting a mansion? That's something that doesn'thappen every day. Aunt Grace invited us up thereevery single summer until I headed off to Oxford. Now who's that? Uh, Duncan. Son of the caretakers. My aunt took him inafter he lost his parents. Uh, anyway- Oh, Lucy, I hate to ask, but must you go all the wayto the States right now? The trustees meeting isjust around the corner. Apparently the way the willis written, if I don't go soon the propertygoes into a receivership and becomes a biglegal mess. I understand. Do what you need to do,but please hurry back. I know I can get the trusteesto approve you. Thanks, Isabelle. I will be back beforeyou even know I'm gone. Oh, I hope so. Because if I don't geta successor soon they'll roast me like... Like... the great fire of Londonin 1666. Precisely. Oh, have a good flight. Thank you. Hello, I'm Lucy Windsor. As if I needed to be told that. I recognized youin an instant. Eleanor, of course. I'm so sorry. I didn't know you still workedat the estate. Oh, yes. How long has it been againsince you've been here? Ten years. I wanted to come backsooner to visit but work just kept me so busy. Your Aunt Grace understood. She was always so proud of you. She's sorely missed in town butshe lived a long and happy life. I just wish she werestill here. So do I, honey. Well, come along. You must be exhaustedafter your flight. Thank you. The back seat? Well, you are the mistressof the estate now, after all. But first an old friend. It is just as beautiful aroundhere as I remember. I had so many wonderfultimes here. And as I recall you and Duncan spent a great amount of timehere together, too. You were kind of sweet oneach other if memory serves. The follies of youth. Actually, Lucy, about Duncan- It's ok, Eleanor. He's one part of all of thisthat I am happy to forget. There she is. Right where you left her. Magical. [sheep baaing] What is all this? The welcoming committee? The fence in our pastureis falling down and your Aunt Grace could neversay no to visitors. You go on in and get settled,honey. Thank you. The door sticks a little. Got it. It's a little sticky, huh? Oh! Lucy? Duncan. What're you doingin my house? Uh... Lucy, what're you doingin my house? Your house? My house. What would give you that idea? It's not an idea it's a fact. That this is my house. No, mine. Ok, I think maybe there's beensome kind of a mistake. Why wouldn't Grace tell me that she was leaving the house to both of us? Tell you? Why wouldn'tshe tell me? I don't know, maybe becauseI've been here and you've been in London? Regardless, it's perfectlyobvious there's been some sort ofa clerical error. You changed your hair. Yeah. [baaing] Shh. So how've you been, Lucy? Oh, I've been good. I've been- I've been really,really good. Good. Good. And you uh, you- you work insome museum in London I heard? Mmmhmm. Yeah, no, and I mighteven become its director. Knock... well, knock wood. And you, you're somefancy architect now? [laughs] Fancy? I don't know. I mean, I'm working for a bigcommercial firm up in Boston. I'm glad we'reall caught up. Excuse me. Eleanor, why didn't you tell meabout Duncan? I tried. You didn't wanna know. I'm gonna make some tea. Besides, it's high timeyou two buried the hatchet. Duncan. This has been lovely. I am going to go take a littlelook around. Be my guest. Or my guest. This place is still amazing. A window backto the 1890's. They don't build houseslike this anymore. And that's a good thing. Give me a modern condoany day. A place you can heat with up-to-date plumbingand electrical. It's still magical though. Yeah, it might look magical but this place is slowlyfalling apart. Note the buckets. It's seen some disrepair sincethe last time you visited, not to mention half of the roomsare already closed up. You see the problem? Yeah, I'm starting to. Grace used to hold herGilded Age Ball in here. Yep, this place has definitelyseen better days. The last two years I've beencoming down here on the weekends to help Graceout with the upkeep when I can. That's surprisingly charitableof you. A brief lapse in judgement,I assure you. But seriously, this placeis an absolute money pit and needs to be sold offat the earliest opportunity. Assuming you own it,which you don't. Which I do, and I'm wellon my way to coming up with a brilliantsales pitch for it. That is if the developer,Mr. Niven, is open to hearingmy presentation. Richard Niventhe billionaire? Ah, you've heard of him. Yeah, he specializesin building golf courses and I've heard he's interestedin opening a new one around here. Turn the estateinto a golf course? Seriously? Oh, I'm sorry. Did- did you have a better planfor this place? Not at this exact moment but surely there must bea better option than turning a magnificentestate into some putting green. This is 1890's at its finest. The stained glass,the marble floors- Out with the old,in with the new. Oooh! Duncan, how canyou be so blind to all the history around you? How can you be so blindto the bottom line? Listen, Frank Lloyd Wrong, you are not going to movea stone of this mansion. Ok. Well thenwhat do you suggest? This has got to besome big mistake. Aunt Grace would never put me insuch an impossible situation. I suggest that we geta little clarity from H .K. Rourke,Attorney at Law, and figure this outin the morning. Fine. Fine. Which hotel are you stayingat in town? Hmm? Hmm? Hotel? No, I'm not stayingat a hotel. I'm staying in the west wing. Of my mansion. Great. Then I'll be staying inthe east wing of my mansion. Great. Mmm. I'm gonna go that wayto the east wing. Yeah, that's fine. Thank you. After you. Mmmhmm. Stop watching me leave. You stop first. [phone ringing] Lucy, how's lifeon your estate? Where do I start? It turns outDuncan is staying here, too. Duncan? His father was the caretaker. He used to live here. But he's impossible,as always. Duncan thinks he inheritedhalf the estate. Co-owners of an estate,that sounds kind of romantic. Trust me, it is the oppositeof romantic. But I have to admit,he does look pretty good. Oh, details, please. What does he look like? A little bit like our statueof Marc Antony. But with the same flairfor betrayal. He's got some scheme to turnthe place into a golf course. A golf course? Well, that seems a bit daft. Exactly. But as soon as we figurethis whole thing out with the lawyers in the morning I am going to sendDuncan packing. Well, good luck, Lucy. Thanks, Jose.I'll need it. [loud grunts] What is happening out there? Hey. Hey, Duncan. Oh, a beautifulmorning to ya. I see you're still notan early riser. You ever hear of a little thingcalled jet lag? Vaguely. But I'm happy to help youget back on to local time. Ok, look. I'm a little tired. I could really use somemore sleep. Do you have to do thatright now? Well, if you want a hot shower before we go visitthe lawyers then yes, the water heater's down so Igotta fire up the old boiler. [loud grunt] Well, can you chop more quietly,please? Oh, you bet. [loud grunt] I give up. Good morning. Eleanor. You really didn't haveto do all this. Of course I did. Oh, it's such a delight to have you and Duncan togetherhere again. We're not together. Definitely not together! Uh, bad choice of words. One lump or two? Stevia? You are H .K. Rourke. Yes, but Hannah is fine. Hi, Duncan. Hello, Hannah. So you two know each other? Duncan took me tothe Newport Regatta. Oh. How lovely. Well, please. Sit down. First, let me extendmy sympathies. Grace was a big partof our community. Thank you. I really miss her. I do, too. That's why it's a little odd tobe talking business right now. And that brings us to thequestion of what happens next. Well, Duncan, regarding that mistakethat you called me about. It's actually not a mistake. Regarding Grace's will the situation is actuallyquite clear. Simply put, you bothown the estate. What? But how can that be? What she said. Grace was quite specificin her will. She arranged that you shouldboth own 50 percent. And I'm sorry that I couldn'texplain the full situation until you had both arrived, but Grace had sworn meto secrecy. Duncan, Grace mentionedin her will how much she appreciates everythingyou and your family did for her over the years and shewanted to extend her gratitude. And Lucy, Grace knewthat you loved that place as much as she didand you would always have its best interestsat heart. Which is why it makes absolutelyno sense that Grace would do this. Well, that much we agree on. Ok, so if I own half... And I own half. Then we have to cometo some sort of agreement. Look, the truth of the matter is the house is all that's left ofthe great Wycliff fortune. There's a small stipend to payfor Eleanor but that's it. And I'm here if you guyshave any more questions. Thank you very much for takingthe time, Hannah. We appreciate it. Oh hey, Duncan, um...really good news. My client, Mr. Niven,has agreed to hear your golf course presentation. I hope it helps. Thanks. Yeah. So Hannah is the one who foundyour potential buyer? Yeah, for a small 10 percentfinder's fee. She's just trying to help. In London we'd call that a weeconflict of interest. Ok. How about we finda civilized way of ironing this all out? Over breakfast maybe? Still got a weaknessfor waffles? I'm buying. You read my mind. Pancakes and waffles. Will do, Duncan. Thank you. And for you, miss? Wait, Lucy? Randall. It's so good to see you. Hi. Wow. Duncan and Lucy. Nice to see you twotogether again. (Both): We're not together. Duncan, you didn'ttell me Lucy's back in town. Well, that's because I'm assurprised as you are, my friend. Well, welcome home, Lucy. You still like your waffleswith strawberries and a pyramid of whipped cream? You have a fantastic memory. So what've you been up to? Just working here, helpingEleanor when she has errands, helping out with the festival. You should stop byif you have time. I'd love to. Ok. I'll put this in. Randall's still a hoot. At least he had the courtesyto send me a Christmas cardevery now and again. You left the country. You never repliedto any of my letters. You know what? Water under the bridge. So how is it thatyou're still so close with everyone herein Newton? I thought you were some high-flying architectin the big city. I have been coming downto Newton every weekend for one reason and one reasononly and that is the estate. It is a monster that needsconstant feeding and I am finished with it. But that house has been herefor over 100 years. How can you turn your backon it? Easy. Look, Lucy, if we couldjust sell this estate I would have the funds to start my own architecture firmand you could go back to London with a tidy little nest egg. What do you say? But if Niven goes for it, what happens to the estate? Well, the plans that I suggestedwould see the grounds opened up for the fairwaysand we would probably have to lose the coach house,the gardens- Bulldoze the gardens? Duncan, over my dead body. Do you have any ideawhat it takes to maintain an estate like this? No, but I wanna leave itin good hands. I don't know, maybe I couldget it designated as a historical landmarkand then I could start applying for grantsto protect it. We would be lucky if Nivenpicked it up. Our other option is putting iton the market and honestly, at this rate, itwouldn't even pass inspection. Ok, so whatdo you propose? I suggest that we sell offa few odds and ends so we have the fundsto patch up the roof while we try to figure out what to do withthe rest of the place. Fine. Ooh. Did you know that Belgianwaffles were invented in the 1800's by the PrinceBishop of Liege? Nobody knows that, Lucy. [laughs] Well, what do you think,dad? My money's on Lucy. She always was headstrongas a kid. True, but Duncan'salways got a trick or two up his sleeve. It's a shame they can't just- Work together. I know. Of course, maybe theyjust need a nudge. Coffee. Coffee. Coffee. Coff- What? No, out. Out. Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. Go on. Out. Out. Out. Out. Go! Morning. Where's Eleanor? Uh, she left a note. She went to town to help outwith the festival and left breakfast on the stove. Meanwhile, why don'tyou put your world class architectural skills to use andfix the lock on the kitchen door so Percy will staywhere he belongs? Percy? I mean the sheep that justpushed his way into the kitchen. Why Percy? Because he's so persistent. Huh. Sounds like somebodyelse I know. I'll add it to the list. So I've totaled the amountof money we'll need for the essential fixes beforewe can even show this place. We'll need to touch upthe paint, fix some of these windows,and, of course, pay the roofers. Better get started. This house has lastedfor 100 years. I think it can make itthrough breakfast. No time like the present. Duncan. Duncan, what're youdoing with those? We need money to fixthe roof, remember? So I thought we could sell offa few of these things at the antique auctionin Newton. It's just collecting dust. But these areAunt Grace's things and Wycliffe family heirlooms. Sacrificing themselvesto keep this house from falling apart seems likethe most noble duty of all. It's just random stuff. Random stuff? That is a 19th centuryoil painting. Yeah. Of, like, trees. And that antique Venetian vaseis in perfect condition. What, this old thing? Oh! Oh, those chandeliersin the Great Hall are probably worth something. No. Duncan, I love those. Ok. How about this? We've got dozens of these. Those are emblematic ofthe fascination in the 1890's of botanyand floral history. We have to keep at least one. Ok. What is your obsessionwith history? No, those are treasures and... this is Aunt Grace's diary. We certainly can't sell that. Ok, granted, that was a mistake. What about this paintingwith the pretty girl in it? Haha, very funny. This Victorian hall standis an antique. Lucy, be practical for once. We need to fix this roof. [sighs] Ok. Fine. But make it quick. Ready? Ok. And this one? I'm proud of you. I'm going to give Randall a call and see if he can give us a handto bring this down to auction. I'm going with you to makesure you get a fair price. Deal. The 1890's were a uniquemoment in our town's history when Henry Wycliff decidedto build his estate here and ended up helping buildmuch of the town. And the Wycliff's continuedthat tradition. Henry's grandson, Arthur,and his wife, Grace, built our city park there. I have nothing but happymemories here. Finally somethingwe can agree on. [piano playing] ♪ Sold. One antique oil paintingfor $1,200. Not bad. That's $3,000 in total. Alright, I'll admit it. You have an eye for this stuff. Oh my, a compliment. Will the wonders ever cease? Alright. [laughs] It's like travelingback in time. It's fascinating, isn't it? Mmmhmm. Yeah, fascinating. You know, that beer gardenback there sounds pretty fascinating, too. You want to join me? You go ahead. I'm going to browse. Lucy Windsor? Is that you? Mr. and Mrs. Jorgensen. You remember my husband Marcus? Of course. Lucy, it's been ages. Randall told us you werein town. Grace would be so happyto have you back home. You're here to handlethe estate, no doubt? Yes. And give Hannah Rourkea little competition? You and Duncan were prettyserious back in the day. Are they, uh, dating? No, but Hannah's the top shotin the darts contest every year and Duncan's got a bullseyeon his back whether he knows it or not. [laughs] Well, she can tag and releasehim for all I'm concerned. Well, Eleanor saysthat you're undecided about what's to comeof the estate. Yes, things are up in the airbut we'll figure it out. Lucy, you must come bythe cafe for dinner to welcome you back to town. I would love to but I'm a littleconcerned about leaving Duncan and the estate alone, goodness knows what he'll tryto sell off next. Well, bring him along, then. The more the merrier. Yeah. Ok. Sure. See you then. Ok. We'll take it. Well, that's very galant of you. Are you buying me a giftwith our money? No, I got this. We need every cent of ourantique money for the repairs. Ok, I take back what I said. You always did havea tiny sweet spot. Mmm. So now you remember. Too bad posterity will rememberyou as the guy who tried to turn a landmarkinto a sand trap. Right. And uh, remind me,what was your idea again? I told you, I'm thinking on it. Oh, can I grab one of these? Egg cream? You know the wayto a girl's heart. Just like old times. Ooh, those look pretty yummy. Yeah, it smells good. Yeah. Oh, look at these. Wow. Can you believe we oncedressed like this? Decades from now some modernarchitect will be saying the same thingabout photographs of us. Oh, I love imaginingwho these people were. Where they worked, where theylived, who they loved. I forgot how much I lovedthis festival. The antiques and the costumes. It's all so unique. Shame it's only once a year. It's too bad it can't lastall ye- What? Nothing. Can we go backto the estate now? Yeah. (Josephine): So how's the life of leisure? A lot more work than I expected. And Duncan? He's still got aNapoleon complex mixed with a dashof Genghis Khan. But in spite of Duncan's plans I have an idea to savethis place. Uh-oh, I can hear the wheels turning from here. What's your plan? Well, it's just that there'sso much history in this town and I realized the estatedoesn't have to be just a historical landmark. Visitors can step back in time. Like that colonial Williamsburgmy nephew visited. Exactly. The town is the perfect stopon the mansion tourist circuit and our little Newton doesn'teven have one museum. The challenge is going to behow to make it happen. Well, if anyone can makeit happen it's you. Oh, and Lucy, don't forget your conference call with the trustees isin four days. I'll be ready. Thank you, Josephine. Bye. Bye. You seriously thinkthat plan's gonna work? Were you eavesdropping? I can't help it. Echo-y halls. Oh. You're not afraid of a littlecompetition, are you? Afraid? Not a chance. So as co-owners of the estateyou don't mind if I present an alternative proposalto your potential buyer? Mr. Niven? Mmmhmm. Of course not. It'll keep you out of my hairwhile I work on my proposal. Please, have at it. Ok. And whichever ideaNiven supports we both agree to approve. Sure. I'm game. Have fun. I'm gonna save your house,Aunt Grace. [classical music plays]♪ You mind turning downyour music? Really? Come on, Duncan.It helps me think. It literally prevents mefrom thinking. Fine. [starts humming] Ok, now you're humming. Lucy, there are literally 39other rooms in this place. You sure you don't wanna workin one of them? Since the estate's half mine Ibelieve this table is half mine and this room inspires me. How's that presentationcoming along? Great. Did I tell you aboutmy idea to turn the solarium into a botanical exhibit? Did I tell you about my plan to turn the solariuminto a pro shop? Huh. According to my web search there are already four othergolf courses within 30 miles. Does this areareally need another? According to my researchit could take years to get a site declareda historical landmark. Tsk tsk. Ah. So you've been researchingmy idea. Guess my plan's got youa little intrigued. Yeah, guilty. Intrigued. At how completely impracticalyou still are. But just for argument's sake, how would you possiblyfund this? I'm going to devote partof the house to showcase antique vendorsand local craftspeople from town and we couldsell their goods here. It's called revenue. Revenue. Mmmhmm. And that revenue would beenough to keep this entire place running? I think it's worth a try. I think you still gotyour head up in the clouds. [turns music back on] ♪ Alright, you know what? If we're going to sharethis estate then maybe we should setsome house rules. Great idea. For starters how aboutno drying your laundry on the priceless antiques? Fine. If you agree to no more thanone hour of your music a day. Fine. Now, if that's all, we are due at the pubfor dinner tonight. We? Look, I said yesfor both of us. I couldn't help it. Yeah, that's great.I'm starving. I'll see you downstairsin five minutes. Well, look who's here. Our guests of honor. What's all this? It's nothing. Just a little dinner to welcomeyou back home to Newton. You didn't have to do this. Nonsense. You two are officiallyour guests of honor. Thank you. I sense a trap. So I hope these rumors aren'ttrue of selling the estate and high-tailing it out of town. You wanna take this one? We're still trying to figurethings out, but I am working on a planto save the old place. Well, Wycliff Houseis this town's heritage and I can't think of anyonebetter than you two to watch over it. To Wycliff House. [together] To Wycliff House. You know, Lucy, I remember allthose summers you visited Grace. You always seemedso at home here. Name one thing that Londonhas that we don't have here. Ok, uh... the museums. [laughs] I'd say this whole townis a museum. [laughter] Can't argue that. Look, all joking aside,I love it here. But my dream job iswaiting for me back in England. Dream job, huh? Well, I'll admit a dream job'spretty serious. But desserts like thisonly come once in a lifetime. Desserts? (Group): Oooh. Truly, you didn't haveto do all this. Oh, but we did. See, your Aunt Grace has helpedevery single person in this town in one way or another and Marcusand I got engaged at the ball that your aunt used to throwevery year and Randall learned to rideat your stables and it's high timethat we repaid the favor. Welcome back. Welcome back. Welcome back, Lucy. I love this part of the estate. I had forgotten how hospitableeveryone is in this town. Yeah, some thingsnever change. I'm starting to get the feeling that they're trying to convinceus to stay. Well, I could think of worsethings than staying. You hear that? What? The sound of the cricketsinstead of us squabbling. It's pretty nice. Hey, tell me something. What happened that last summerwe were here together? You were headed offto grad school. You were gonna be thousandsof miles away. How could it have worked? So you just cut and ran? It was the practicalthing to do. Mmm. Practical. Again. Someone had to be. You were always the dreamer. Ok, look. I... I know my ideais just a pipe dream and you're right. It does take forever to geta historical designation but I can't just sit byand watch all of this go away. This estate is home to way toomany happy memories for me and- and Aunt Grace- I miss Grace, too. You forget, I lived hereyear round. I know every inchof this place. I grew up here. I went to Bostonto start over but Grace needed my helpand this estate and all of its needs keptcalling me back over and over and over. I need to be done with it. This firm is the most importantthing to me. I've always been focusedon the past and you've always been focusedon the future. Who says historyhas to repeat itself? What do you mean? Ok, well let's face it. A house dividedcannot stand. Go on. I want a historical site,you want a golf course. Why can't we have both? I am not following you. How about a resortthat showcases history? It's the best of both worlds. Interesting. But Niven is expecting a golfcourse, plain and simple. But he's a business man, and we'd be doubling thepotential revenue stream and preserving history. More tourists flockto this town every year. That's an opportunity. True. And we could hold Grace'sGilded Age Ball just like she used to do and really show offthe estate to Niven the way it's meant to be seen. That seems very ambitious. We have two daysto come up with a sales pitch. What do you think? A golf course that doublesas a history park. Yeah, why not? Maybe it's the moonlight but I think you might beon to something. Deal? Deal. [laughs] So the fountain stays put. That's right. And we won't haveto move a stone. And then the Great Hallbecomes our grand lobby. We make a pretty good team. Like Hamilton and Burr. Before all that unpleasantness. Sure. What's next? You know, for an architect you have some prettygood hands-on skills. Thanks. My dad used to let mehelp him fix things around the house. Do you know that Aunt Graceand Arthur were married hereon the estate? I wonder how many other weddingsthis property has seen. Weddings. That's not a bad ideato add to the proposal. Yeah. You know, courtship in the late1800's was truly fascinating. A gentleman's invitation toa dance was often delivered to a lady in a letter to avoidany misunderstanding, and suitors would woo theirbeloved with moonlit serenades and poetry and acts of chivalry,of course. Sounds exhausting. [laughs] Will you help me move this,please? Sure. Oh, watch out! Chivalrous. Well, I think I'm gonna gowash up and then what do you say we headto the festival? Perfect. We can spread the wordabout the ball. Oh, it is so greatthat you're bringing back Grace's Gilded Age Ball. Well, it is the finaleof our pitch to Niven to preserve Wycliff House. Give me those. I'll put these up around town. That'll show Niven whatWycliff means to this town. Take a shot, folks. Take a shot,and win a prize. Come on. Take a shotand win a prize. Take home a beautiful antiquevase from the Gilded Age. Miss, what about you? Oh, no, no, no. Thank you very much. Come on, Lucy. It looks fun. I bet you picked up some skillsback in England. The only targets I'mused to hitting these days are third quarter donations. No. Thank you. No thank you. I get it. You're scared.That's cool. Scared? Ok. Since you put itthat way, I'll take two turns. I'll show you who is scared. Blech! What was that? Your technique isall over the place. Look, may I? So, the thing with darts is you gotta line it upfrom your shoulders. Raise your elbow. Good to go. Alright. Here goes. Hey, look who's here. Looks like you're getting intothe spirit of things, Lucy. We're just taking a break from the estate to enjoythe festival. You know what?This does look like fun. I'm gonna play, too. Hannah, you clear outall my prizes every year. Thank you. Duncan's been reallymysterious lately, what have you two been up to? Just trying to do what's bestfor our place. Well, I've set up the perfectopportunity for you. I hope you're ready for Niven. Maybe your sales pitch is moreon target than your dart game. And then you can be done withthe estate and head back home. That is still the plan,isn't it? Yes. Yes, it is. Don't feel bad, Lucy.It's an acquired skill. You know, at Oxford we startwith our weaker hand when we play freshmen. [applause] It won me a round or two. Ooh, thank you. That's nice. ♪ Uh, that was amazing. [laughing] I'm glad my post-gradcame in handy for something. Thank you for sharing. Mmm. You're welcome. Sharing an estate is easy. Sharing my popcorn,that's a challenge. Well, I'd say we're doinga pretty good job at it. You know, we were alwaysdifferent. But somehow it just works. You know what they sayabout opposites. So uh, you and Hannahseem pretty close, huh? Sure. I mean, she's beenvery helpful with things. You sure it ends there? Yes, I am sure it ends there. [laughs] What about you? Are you, uh, are youseeing anyone back in London? No, not really. The last guy I datedwas perfectly nice but he just didn't appreciate the things I'm passionate about,you know? The final straw was whenI caught him listening to a cricket match ata Michelangelo exhibit. [thunder rolls] Woah. We should probably head back. Yeah, and I've got a conferencecall to prepare. Not to mention a GildedAge Ball to plan. Let's go. Brr, that came down fast! Let's get a fire started,warm this place up. It'll be a lot easier to fixthings up around here if our fingers aren'tfrozen solid. That's good. Hurry up. I'm trying. Get closer. I'm freezing. [phone rings] Work calls. Again. Alright, well I'll just be righthere trying to get this lit. Hi, Josephine. Lucy, how's the life of luxury? [laughs] Lovely. Just missing a few modernconveniences like heating. Can you hear myteeth chattering? And Duncan? Still a battle of wills? Actually, he's been a littlemore Gandhi than Genghis lately. Go figure. Well I just wanted to let youknow that I emailed you the spreadsheets you asked forwith all of the donor totals for your call. Perfect, thank you. And I'll give you a heads up when I know what time yourcall is with the trustees. In the meantime,stay warm. Bye, Josephine. Thank you. Bye. (Duncan): Finally! This is better. Everything okon the home front? Yeah. Just getting my ducks ina row for my conference call with the trustees. The big promotion. Mmmhmm. You really wantthis new job, huh? Of course I do. Then why don't you soundso convinced? It's just I got into museum workbecause I love history. Preserving the past. Sharing a story that's beentold for centuries. But my job keeps pulling me awayfrom all that. You know, so much of the realwork is politics and red tape. Budgets and donors. So would this new promotion,this-this dream job, allow you to do more ofwhat you love? Actually, I don't know. Then why exactlydo you want it? [knocking] Who could that be? I just invited a fewfriends over. That's how I thinkyou all can showcase your merchandise right here. So I could exhibit my vintagecostumes here. Exactly. And Eleanor,I was thinking you could showcase your bakingskills in a little bakery we'll set up in the downstairskitchen. Wonderful. You know, I bet half the folksin town would jump at the chance to sell their antiquesand crafts up here to visiting guests. That's the idea. And if our buyergoes for our proposal, your crafts and antiques willhave a home here year-round. So what do you think? I'd say we thinkit's all a great idea. Fantastic. Well, I'll need youall to be set up for our presentationto Niven. And we expect to see youall tomorrow at the- Ball, tomorrow night. We can't wait. Oh, we look forward to seeingyou take the first dance. Just like Grace and Arthurused to do. First dance? Well, we can't arguewith tradition, can we? Wait a second. Don't tell me that you are stillself-conscious about dancing. A little. Ok. How about a littlerefresher course? [plays music] ♪ May I have this dance? ♪ I haven't danced in years. Really? I thought your job wasjust going to fancy parties. That's not my job. And anyway, when I dogo to fancy parties I'm there to schmooze donors. There's no time for dancing. Mmmhmm. And what will happenafter this big promotion? Double the schmoozing,I guess. [giggles] ♪ So um... I've got some thingsI wanna- No, no. I have- no, I do,because of the conference- That's right. The big conference callthat I need to prep for, so... Thanks for the dance. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll uh- Yeah, good luck. Thank you. Any time. Good-bye Bye. Hey. Hey. So, you and Lucy readyfor the ball? Yeah, yeah. I'd say so. Of course you realize,my friend, you now havea second chance. At what? Come on, Duncan. Lucy was the one that got away.We both know it. Yeah, well, she's heading backto London soon and historywill repeat itself. Mmm. As I recall last time she left you didn't exactly beg herto stay. It was the responsible thingto do. Well, maybe there's a reasonyou and Lucy are back in eachother's lives now. But you'll never knowif you hold yourself back. Thanks. Thank you. Oh, Eleanor, thosesmell delicious. Will you put them over thereon the table for me please? You got it. Thank you. What do you thinkabout this here? Oh, perfect. Your aunt would be so proud ofeverything you've done here. Thank you. Lucy. You got a second? What is it? Niven's gonna behere any minute. I know, I know, I just wantto show you something. Ok. Ta-dah. I snuck it downto Randall's for a little rust removaland polish. It looks amazing. Everything does. Oh yeah, and Eleanor even foundsome of Grace's old decorations. So, you feeling readyfor tonight? Yeah, I guess. But I have to admit,I am a little nervous. Oh, come on. Was Joan of Arc nervous when sherallied those French troops? Well... no, but things didn'twork out very well for her. Ok, that's a good point,good point. Um, well, was Cleopatranervous? Did she retreat whenthe Greeks showed up? It was the Romans actually,not the Greeks, but anyway those are importantfigures from history. That's exactly my point. So are you. Um... we should finishgetting ready. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Welcome, Mr. Niven. Thank you for your interestin buying Wycliff House. My pleasure. Hannah's told me great thingsabout you both. Well, we have a visionto present to you today, and though it might not be quitewhat you expected we believe it's an evenbetter opportunity than just a golf course. So, without further ado... Imagine a resort with all theamenities of a five-star hotel. Golf, a spa, luxuryaccommodations... and with all the historyof a world-class museum. And as the guests wanderthrough the estate... They will stroll back in time and imagine themselvesas Vanderbilts or Morgans, living the lives of gentlemenor debutants. They will walk amid livinghistory and experience life in the Gilded Age first-hand. And then afterwards they mightenjoy a round of golf or a cocktail by the fire. Please follow me. And our rose garden providesthe ideal location for weddings and events. While paying homage tothe estate's historic character. All with five-star diningand accommodations. All our plans are herein our proposal and uh, here's our vision ofhow the house can be renovatedand preserved. A fusion of historic splendorand modern luxury while keeping this magnificentestate intact. All while delivering one ofthe finest golf courses in New England. Please. Thank you. What is going on? This is not what we discussed. It's fine. Everything is gonnabe fine. You'll see. Just waituntil tomorrow. And you'll still getyour finder's fee, I promise. Oh I hope you knowwhat you're doing. More and more people are visiting the townof Newton lately, making this a unique businessopportunity for you. But it's more than that. I spent all my summers hereas a girl and it was the happiest timeof my life. I'd like others to experiencethat, too. Which is why I'd like to makethis a condition of the sale. And on that note,let me show you where you could plan to putthe back nine. And at our ball tonightyou'll get a glimpse of what life was like herein the Gilded Age. Looking forward to it. [phone rings] I hate to interrupt your fairytale but I'm trying to round up all of the trustees foryour conference call later but everyone's in differenttime zones. One's traveling in Dubai,another in Singapore... I'll keep you posted. Great. I'm just juggling a few thingshere but I'll be ready. (Duncan): Lucy, the caterers are here I need your help! Sounds like a gentleman caller awaits. I have to get readyfor the ball. Have fun, and I'll give youone hour heads up before your call sothat you can get settled. Perfect. Thanks, Josephine. Bye. [classical music plays]♪ I would have invitedyou by sending a letter but I was worriedthat it would take too... You look amazing. You look pretty nice yourself. Thanks. I um, I borrowedthis from Randall. I'm feeling a littleoverdressed. Don't. It suits you. Shall we? May I introduce our hostsfor the evening, Lucy and Duncan ofWycliff House. [applause] Lucy, aren't you a vision? Oh, your aunt would be so happy there's dancing inthe ballroom again. Thank you, Eleanor. You know, I would take thisover some stuffy donor's cocktail party any day. I don't see Niven. Lucy, it's time. Your aunt always openedthe gala with a few words. Hey, thanks for coming. Hey. Thank you allfor coming tonight. Before our evening beginsI want to share with you something my Aunt Gracealways told me. How her grandfather-in-law,Henry Wycliff, felt that this housewas for everyone. Here the gardenermight find himself at dinner eating peach pie next toPresident Grover Cleveland. Henry opened his doorsto all and my Aunt Grace would beso happy to know that we're keepingthat spirit alive tonight. I'm not sure I can followin my Aunt Grace's footsteps but I will try my best. And on that note, letthe first dance begin. [applause] You ready? Ready as I'll ever be. You ok? Everyone is staring. You're right, but I thinkthey're staring at me. Wondering how I got sucha beautiful dance partner. [classical music playing]♪ [classical music playing]♪ So you're due backin London next week. Well, I suppose everygood fairytale has to have an ending. Maybe. Being back here, I've rememberedsome history. What? How happy I used to be here. How happy I am now. [phone alert] What is it? Josephine's been texting.I missed it. Sorry, Duncan. I'll be back as soon as I can. [sheep baas] Josephine. I am so sorry I missedyour call. It was so noisy here I couldn'thear the phone ring. Lucy, are you ready? Yeah. For when? Uh... for now? Your conference callwith the trustees? [baaing] Hi everybody. Uh, Lucy, is that a sheepbehind you? Yep. And now I'd like to talk youthrough some numbers. How'd it go? Honestly... not great. I'm sorry. Between the sheep, the music, and keeping them waitingan hour, it was kind of a disaster. [laughs] But the good news is at leastI can finally relax now. How about a dance? That sounds great. Thank you for a trulywonderful evening. Let me read over your proposaland run the numbers and I'll have an answer for youby 8:30 tomorrow morning. Good night. Good night. Good night. After you. No pressure. No pressure at all. 8:30, right on time. Duncan, whatever happens, I really wanna thank you for trying to do somethingnoble here and meeting me halfway. I would say we makea pretty great team. Great party last night. And I went over thenumbers afterwards. I like the property. Like the views,like the town. But I'm a straight shooter. I'm afraid restoring this estateto its former glory would simply costs too much. This place likely needs updatedplumbing, mechanical, electrical, and other things we'd only be able to guess atright now. So for a full and modernrestoration, I'm sorry, I'm afraidthe numbers just don't work. The most cost-effectivesolution would be a simple tear-down and building a brand newgolf course from the ground up. And I assume that's whatyou'd be proposing- Sir, you're not seeingthe bigger potential. No, I'm sorry. My heart says yesbut the numbers say no. And the numbersalways win. I'm afraid my answer is no. I'm sorry to hear that. Will you guys just excuse usfor a moment, please? Let me walk you to your car. Thank you. (Hannah): Duncan, I told you this would happen. I delivered you a buyer on a silver platter and all you had to do was go along with the plan. I told Niven that you would be presenting himwith a golf course. And we gave him one.And more. Look, Lucy and I thought that- You and Lucy? You promised to get Lucyon board. Not throw me overboard. Look, you said it yourself. It was fine to tear down the estate if that's what it took to make the sale. Yes, yes, I said it was fineto tear down the estate, but now I think we havea better option. Which Niven doesn't want. Ok, look. We have about a dayto sell Niven on the plan that he expected. I suggest that you come up withsomething to change his mind. [door slams] Just give me a second. Lucy! So you're still fine tearingdown the entire place? Were you- were you just snoopingon me? Echo-y halls, remember? Yeah, I uh- I promised Hannahthat I'd try to convince you to sell to Niven. To level the estatefor a golf course. Well, it just- it felt like themost practical plan at the time- Practical. Again, more proof we werenever right for each other. I don't know why I'mso surprised, Duncan. You always do what's rightfor you. Wait, that's not... Lucy... Lucy. [phone alert] There might be hope for us yet,Duncan. I'm not so sure about that. Lucy just texted, she's willingto give us carte blanche to do whatever we wantwith the estate. Just now? This improvesour hand immensely. It should be easy to finda buyer now. Who wants to tear downthe estate. Duncan, you said that you wantedto be free of this place. This is your chance. A chance to move onto something new. You'll have enough to set upyour own firm in Boston just like you hoped. It's time to thinkabout the future. [phone rings] Isabelle. I am so sorryabout last night. Why would you need to apologize? Well, after the wholeteleconference fiasco. Yes, well, Lucy, your spreadsheets spoke for themselves. So I hope you're gettinga chance to relax because when you get back you'll have somebig shoes to step into. Which shoes? Specifically mine. The trustees votedto approve you. You're kidding? There'll be a boost in salary, of course. That's wonderful. Yes, and we'll discuss itall on Monday when you're back in London. You need an answer now? Lucy, perhaps youdon't understand. The trustees approved you. You got the job you wanted. The one a million peoplewould kill for. Yes. No, um... of course,I'm as happy as... As Alexander when he conqueredEgypt in 332 B.C.? Yes. No, exactly. I gladly accept the job,Isabelle. Thank you. And I will see you tomorrowwhen I fly back to London. Good. Bye-bye. Oh, Lucy. You're up early. I was wondering if you couldgive me a ride to the airport? Oh. Of course. I didn't know you were goingback to England so soon. Honestly, neither did I. Well, um, just let me finish uphere and I'll get my coat and I'll be right with you. Ok. Marcus, we got a problem. I'm really gonna missthis place. And you'll be missedin Newton. So how long is your flight back? Door to doorabout 10 hours but uh, I brought some reading. Aunt Grace's diary. I thought I'd take it backwith me as a keepsake. I think Grace would haveliked that. Goodbye, Lucy. Goodbye. Something wrong, Duncan? You usually wolf downmy Monte Cristo sandwich in two seconds flat. Niven flies off in about an hourand I need to finish this pitch. You know, Eleanor just called to tell me Lucy leftfor the airport. She left? Headstrong as always. Who's the headstrong one here? And proud, as well. You think I'm being proud? She won't even give me a chanceto explain. You let her go once. Are you gonna let her slipthrough your fingers again? What choice do I have? Go stop her. I don't think she wantsto see me right now. You know, your dad and Iwere good friends. If he was here I'm pretty surewhat he'd say. What's that? Being caretaker of the estate was more than justchanging lightbulbs. Your dad thought he was acaretaker of something precious. He knew some thingswere worth saving. Randall? I've got a job for you. Lucy, Lucy, hey wait! Duncan,what're you doing here? I need to talk to you. I couldn't let you go backto London again without you understanding. I never wanted to let you gothat last summer. I know. I... I read Aunt Grace's journal and her descriptions of howyou waited for me every summer before I arrived and how sad you wereevery summer after I left. I need you to give meone more chance. A chance for what? I've been working on thisproposal for Niven. It's a long shot but I thinkhe might just go for it. Would you just postponeyour flight for one more day? I don't know, Duncan. You were right, it does seema little impractical. Letting you go was the mostpractical decision that I have ever made. It's also the worst decisionof my entire life. Now I'm asking youto trust me. Please. What did you have in mind? I will tell you all about iton the way back. But right now I believe we havea billionaire to catch. Ok. Right, no, I understand Mr. Niven's timeis incredibly limited. Ok. We will certainly try. Thank you so much. Yeah. Bye-bye. Ok, so Niven is flying outto Aspen to meet his grandkids but his assistant said thatwe might be able to catch him before he checks out of hishotel and heads to the airport but he's leaving very soon. You my ride? Yes sir. That I am. (Lucy): Shoot, it's the festival. I forgot. (Duncan): It's the last day. We'll have to go on foot. (Lucy): Alright. Oh, wow. We gotta hurry. Ok, come on. Follow me. Excuse me. Excuse us. Excuse me. Oh, this is impossible. Sorry. Sorry. Listen, young man, I've gota plane waiting for me. I just can't figure it out. It's never happened before. I probably just floodedthe engine. I'll have it up and runningin no time. How much? Ah, look at that. Ready to go. Unless, do you wannagrab a bite? I know a greatrestaurant nearby. Just drive, please. Right. Mr. Niven! Do you have just a minuteor two? Look, I appreciate your effortsbut you need to understand that I'm not in the habit ofreconsidering an offer I've already turned down. Right, but we're not talkingabout a purchase anymore, we're talking about a smallseed investment. Less risk for you,much more return. Now, you told us that your heartsaid yes but the numbers said no,right? Well, now I think you'll findthe numbers say yes. I was able to re-worksome of the renovation costs and save us some money soafter an initial investment we can renovate as we gofunded solely by profits. It's all in here. I'll look at it on the plane. But even assuming your numbersadd up why would I want to invest ina historical resort? For a reason you can'tput a price on. Preserving your legacy. You're a grandfather, right? Ok, well how do you wantyour grandkids to remember their grandpa? As the generous man whoput them through college. [laughs] My aunt used to tell me storiesabout another generous man. A railroad baron namedHenry Wycliff who was a very wealthy man but he also wanted everyonearound him to live rich lives, too. He built this whole town.Its parks, its library. His spirit is everywhere here. You can see for yourself.It's all in here. People still rememberhis generosity and if you have the visionto help preserve his legacy then maybe in 100 yearsfrom now people will be remembering youwith the same fondness. That's the great thingabout history. It lasts forever. I'll be in touch. Let's go. I just got off the phonewith Hannah. I think you may havejust sold him on it. Well, convincing donorswas my job. Was? I realized something. My future isn't in some office five stories abovethe exhibits I love doing spreadsheets. My future is here. So you'll stay? This is where I belong. My home is hereand so is my heart. Great, thank you. [sighs] Not bad. Not bad at all. So how does it feel to haveyour architectural office in your own house? My house? Wait a second,I thought this was your house. [laughs] It's our house. It's our house.
