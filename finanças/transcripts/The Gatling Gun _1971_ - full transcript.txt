(exciting instrumental music) (carriage rattling) (foreboding music) (sizzling) (rumbling) (clattering) (ominous music) - Move out! (hooves clattering) - [Driver] Yah! Yah, get out of here! Yah! Yah! (suspenseful music) (soldiers hooting) - [Soldier] Swerve to the left! (yelling) (foreboding music) (gun cranking) (booming) - [Solider] Squad B, follow me! (suspenseful music) (whistling) (gun cranking) (gunshot booming) (groaning) (foreboding music) (horse grunting) (horse neighing) (thudding) - [Man] Talk when the Colonel asks a question, damn you! - Where's the gun, Sneed? - Make it easy on yourself, soldier. You're facing a hanging now for treason. (spitting) - Go to hell. I told you, I don't know anything about a gun! (hooves thundering) - No sign of the Gatling, sir. - [Soldier] Detail! Rejoin company, ho! - I forbid you to carry this any further, sir. - You forbid? Lt. Malcolm, talk to this man. - Reverend Harper, there are a lot of dead people because of this man. - Private need cleanse himself before God and man when helped me do away with the instrumental hell. If you must punish someone then punish me. - Reverend, we've all heard you speak on the Indian reservations. We know that you're in favor of peace. We commend you for that. - Oh, now isn't that nice? - But Two-Knife is a killer Apache. A white man hater. - Hasn't he every reason to be? - Look, we're military men. We're not interested in the politics of this situation. - Two-Knife have every right to live free on his own land. - If he's a good Indian, no one's gonna bother him. - You mean a reservation Indian? - But he's not on the reservation, is he? He's on the war path with almost a hundred braves. - I've lived among the Apache. I know Two-Knife. I've never been harmed. Weapons like the Gatling gun can destroy people and whole nations. It is evil and must be done away with. For what other reason would he help me destroy the gun? - [Colonel] Apache gold. - [Reverend] That isn't true. Tell them it isn't true. - What time does a trooper have to go prospecting, Reverend? - Those are trapper saddle bags, not mine. - You be quiet! We rode through Grand Forks looking for you. It's been burned down, everybody's been killed. Those Apaches are looking for that gun and they know that you have it. Now I want to know why, how? - Grand Forks? - Did you know that this man was in the guard house for murder? And that the other trooper shot two of our soldiers to get him out to help you steal that gun? - But they helped me destroy the gun! - Then I have to know where it is to make sure. Because if Two-Knife gets his hands on it, we'll have nothing but Grand Forks all over the place. - But why? Why did they come to me? - Two-Knife needed you. You're the only man that could move freely through that garrison. - No, no. (crying) (ominous music) - It doesn't seem to be harmed, sir. - [Colonel] I didn't expect it to be. Get someone to make it operable, Malcolm. - Yes, sir. That'll be your job, Mitchell. - Yes, sir. (whooshing) (screaming) (foreboding music) - [Colonel] Apaches! Take cover, come on! (Apaches Indians whooping) (gunshots booming) (horses neighing) (gunshots booming) (horse screeching) (gunshots booming) (horses screeching) - Wayne, carry the Gattling back to the garrison along with the prisoners. Take 10 men. The gun must be kept safe at all costs. (gunshots booming) (Apaches hooting) (gunshots booming) - Load him in the wagon, Runner. (gunshots booming) - I must talk to Two-Knife. We must stop this killing. He'll listen to me. - Reverend Harper, you get up in that wagon an quick. (gunshots booming) - Do you need Runner? - No, take him and get the hell out of here! (gunshots booming) - Hold your fire! Rest of you, follow me. Call 'em two! (suspenseful music) (Apaches hooting) (whistling) - [Runner] Forward, ho! - Move out on the double! (suspenseful music) (ominous tempo music) (hooves rumbling) Whoa. You know this place? - Pueblo De La Santos. It looks deserted. - Yeah. We'll spend the night here. Elwood. - Yes, sir. - Take a look around. (ominous music) (gunshot booming) Take cover! (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) - Something funny here, Lieutenant. Can't be the Apaches. Some of those shots sound like pistols. (distant gunfire booming) - We better try, hold your fire! Hold your fire inside. We're US Calvary, who are you? - [Man] Walk out into the light so we can see you. - Wanna get yourself killed? Those buckskins would mistake you for an Apache. You can see me. - [Man] Come on in. - Runner. Benton. (gun clicking) (sighing) I'm Lt. Wayne Malcolm. This is my scout, Runner. - Sorry for the reception, Lieutenant, but we can't afford to take any chances. - You didn't and I got a wounded man out there to prove it. - I'm sorry. Please bring him inside and we'll fix a bed for him by the fire. Lieutenant, this is my family. My daughter, Martha, my boy, Jim. I'm Luke. Luke Boland. And the man in the back is Tin Pot. - This is Reverend Harper and his daughter. - Miss Harper, Reverend. Welcome. Make yourselves comfortable. - Well, let's get Elwood. You gonna make it, soldier? - Gonna make it all right, sir. - All right, Benton, you tie that man to this thing. Get some men, get the Gatling gun into the house. - Yes, sir. (crickets chirping) (thudding) Benton, I want a double guard for the night. If anything moves, you shoot it. That includes him. - Yes, sir. - Let's go, soldier. Runner? Put him on the bench, Runner. - Martha, see if you can help him, honey. - Mr. Boland, who was the marksman? - My Martha shoots as good as anyone, Lieutenant. Sometimes better. - Thanks a lot, lady. - Just be thankful for small favors, blue boy. (ominous music) - Open the door! - [Wayne] How're you coming with that thing, Richard? - I can't make it out yet, sir. - [Wayne] Well you keep at it. - Tell me something, Lieutenant, why did you come this way? To La Santas? - Safer, probably shorter. Don't forget, we're running too. - Yankees? That figures. - Lieutenant, this thing looks deadly. - Yeah, Mr. Boland, it is deadly. You see, the Calvary's spread kinda thin in this territory. So the war department assigned us this Gatling. We're taking it to the garrison. - Looks like a 10 barrel coffee grinder. - Ever see anything new work right the first time? - You got a point there, sonny. Like them first Winchesters. Always jamming, they was. - Lieutenant, who invented this? - Doctor feller named Richard Jordan Gatling. - Well, you're a bearcat. A hundred miles from nowhere and he knows all about Gatlings. - First of them come out in 1861. - Did, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Then how come I never saw one in action? - Because you was fighting them hillbilly Yankees. - They hardly were used in the war. Tin Pot, do you know this will fire about 500 round a minute? (whistling) - No wonder Lee gave up so suddenly. - Yeah. Jefferson Davis knew what it could do. - And a doctor invented that, huh? - Mm-hmm. - That's ironic. A healer of human beings creating a machine of destruction like this. - Yeah but it seemed that his motive was just the opposite. He figured that if he could invent a weapon that could make war terrible, people would stop fighting with each other. - I know, but Lieutenant, that's for dreamers. Why didn't he study human nature first? (clicking) - What's the matter, Mitchell? - Something's missing here, sir. - Well, don't pound on it. You're not gonna find anything by pounding on it. - Why don't you let Tin Pot fix it? - Do you think you can fix it? - Well, not iffin I don't try, I can't. - All right, give it a try. (clicking) - Sonny, why don't you go outside and play with your toy pistol until I get through? - How'd you come to find yourself here, Mr. Boland? - Apaches on the war path. Caught us off guard at the ranch. Coming out your ears. Burned everything that they couldn't carry away. Took every head of livestock that I own, with the exception of those two. Lucky to get out alive. Smoke, Lieutenant? - Thanks, I'll take it for later. - That's why we keep 'em in there. (clicking) (sniffling) - Jim thought you'd might like to put this around you. Oh, he said he wouldn't need it. (somber guitar music) - Thanks. - Here, put this in your innards. (somber music) (whooshing) (groaning) (ominous music) (gunshot booming) - Blow out that lantern. - [Luke] Do as he says, quick! (suspenseful music) - [Wayne] Everybody get down! - I'll be right back. - Cover me, I gotta get Sneed. Runner, your knife. (ominous music) - What's the matter, Lieutenant? Afraid somebody's gonna steal me? (gunshot booming) (yelling) (foreboding music) - All right, move. (gunshot booming) (Apaches hooting) (gunshots booming) Thanks again, Runner. - Wasn't me. It was her. - The Apache got in the way. - Well, tie this one up, Runner. (Apaches hooting) (gunshots booming) (ominous music) (horses neighing) - Lieutenant! Your horses! (suspenseful music) (hooves thundering) - Wagon. We need that. (gagging) (swishing) (foreboding music) (gunshots booming) Hold you're fire. - Two-Knife! Two-Knife! Two-Knife, my friend! Two-Knife! - Get back inside! - Stop, Two-Knife! - Harper, will you listen to me?! - Two-Knife, it's your friend! Reverend Harper! (arrow swishing) (gagging) (gunshot booming) Your friend. (gagging) - Get him inside. (ominous music) (gunshots booming) - He's dead. (sinister music) - The wagon. (gunshots booming) (horses squealing) (melancholy music) - [Runner] How're we gonna move the wagon without horses? - [Wayne] We use these two here. - Those are our horses. - Well that's fine. We're not taking them, we're just borrowing them. - The Indians left us alone here until you came. - Relax or you'll boil over, fella. We're all in this together. - Hold it right there! (ominous music) (thudding) - I'd appreciate it, son, if you'll control your temper so I can control the back of my hand. You heard what the man said. We're all in this together. They're yours, Lieutenant. (somber music) - Runner, we're gonna be out of all this when we meet up with the Colonel tomorrow. Just don't know. (somber music) - Loosen these ropes, will you? I can't feel my fingers anymore. It's too bad about Holy Joe. - Don't call him Holy Joe. He was good to my mother. - He was only your stepfather. (dramatic music) Come on, is that all I get for sticking my neck out for you? - For me? Well now, I didn't see you hesitate when I showed you Two-Knife's gold. - It's been a long time. - I know. But it's hardly the time or the place. - Then let's get out of here. - Impossible. They have guards all over the church. Besides, I think we oughta stay with the Gatling until Two-Knife frees us. - From the looks of it, Malcolm is not gonna be taken easy. It's making me nervous. - But they're on foot now, they can't be taken easy. - Not if they get that Gatling to working. - You know what I don't understand? Trapper said it worked perfectly. - It's probably jammed or something. How much did Two-Knife offer us? And I never did see that stuff Trapper had in his saddlebags. - Five sacks like these. If he gets the Gatling. Here. - All right. Just keep reminding me of this stuff. Cause I'm getting awful tired of being kicked around. - So am I. (men chattering) - Say, Lieutenant. I'm afraid with that gun in there and that big load, those horses are gonna give out, they're getting tired. - All right, everybody out, we all walk from here on. Take point. (sighing) Move out! (birds chirping) - Thanks, Runner. - Yes, ma'am. - Runner, how long have you known the lieutenant? - Since before he went to military school, I worked for his family. He was a young one then. I fought in the war beside his brother in '63. He's made of fine stuff, ma'am. - I know they're out there, Lieutenant. - Yes, sir, Two-Knife's out there all right. - Then why doesn't he attack? - Because he doesn't know what we know, baby. That the Gatling gun isn't working. (foreboding music) - Hold up! - Lieutenant. Lieutenant. - Huh? - Let's don't stop here unless we're gonna make a camp. - Well, Mr. Boland, we're gonna make a camp. - Where's Mitchell? - Up high. We keep an eye on everything. All right, we'll make camp. (crickets chirping) - It's the best you've made, Tin Pot. (Mitchell screaming) - [Wayne] Snipers, stay at your posts! (suspenseful music) - [Mitchell] Lieutenant, help me! Lieutenant, please help me! - Oh God, it's Mitchell! It's my cousin! - Hey, come back here, soldier! (arrow swishing) (Apaches hooting) (sinister music) - Please! Lieutenant, help me, help me! Please! - Everybody keep your positions. (Mitchell screaming) - Oh no! - So what're we gonna do? Stand by and let him burn?! - You shut up, soldier! Just say where you are! - Please! Please! (gasping) Oh! Oh! Please! Please! Oh, please! Please! Help me, please! Oh God! (groaning) Oh God! Oh! Oh! Oh! Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Don't let me burn! Don't let me burn! Don't let me burn! - Runner. (Mitchell screaming) (gun cranking) (ominous music) (booming) (fire crackling) - Benton. - What? - Sorry about the kid. We were friends once. - Yeah. - You got a minute to talk? So I made a bad move. What the hell? On the pay we get, gold can be a hell of a temptation, especially a lot of it. Reach in my pocket. Go ahead. And that's nothing. What's a corporal's pay? Not very much. Go on, keep it. I got plenty more. - Hell fire! Just when I thought I had it! - What're you hollering about, Tin Pot? What's the matter? - Oh, the damn thing's simple but it's gotta be perfect. Firing pin's missing. - That's a firing pin? - The master firing pin's missing. Oh, if I had a grind wheel. You see, this is a railroad spike. Now if I can get it fine smooth, it'll work, I'm positive. Don't worry, I'll get it or I'll bust a gizzard. - You keep it up, Tin Pot, and thank you for the help. - Oh, it's all right, Lieutenant. We're all in this damn thing together. (birds chirping) - Jim. Where's that firing pin, Sneed? - I don't know what you're talking about. - The firing pin for the Gatling gun, where is it? Search him, Jim. - Hey! That gold's from the White Mountains. That's Two-Knife country. (ominous music) - Hold it, Indian, right where you are! Lieutenant! (man speaking foreign language) - Does anyone here understand Spanish? - Sure, we got-- - [Wayne] Yeah, I know. Tin Pot. - He says he's got a message for you. (speaking foreign language) He says they want the "King Gun." That's what they call the Gatling. Otherwise, we all die. Maybe like Mitchell. And he says you can answer him in English. He understand. - Why doesn't he talk English? - Some of 'em hate us so much they won't speak our language. But you gotta be strong with him, Lieutenant, unless you wanna give him the gun. - You come here under a flag of truce without even asking me if I'll accept it. Under my rules, I could kill you. You dishonored yourselves by burning my scout. That was the act of a squall. You didn't scare us. I don't wanna kill anymore of your people but many more Braves will die if you make me us that Gatling gun. You tell that to your leader. - Do not speak of soldiers with honor. That is White Eyes' honor. Gold! And I give you gold, even more! Give us the gun and go! - All men are human, even soldiers. But there are many who will not sell their honor. Sometimes it's easier to die. - You'll die, White Eyes. They die. - Chief Two-Knife! (ominous music) I could kill you right now. And maybe or maybe not, it would solve all of our problems. I don't have anything to risk. What do you have to say? (speaking foreign language) - He wants to know how you know he's Two-Knife. - It is said, there is only one Apache chief who speaks fluent Spanish and understandable English. (gun clicking) Two-Knife can go, I give him his life. - I give you your life. Except for that one. He will die no matter. He has failed me. Your time is short. (sinister music) (suspenseful music) - About a mile out there, lots of pony tracks, some of them shot. - Shot? But they gotta be our horses. - I followed the tracks down the bend a ways. Same thing. Traveling and then doubling back in a circle around us. Following the river bend. Suppose they are afraid of the gun. - We know that they're afraid of something. - I hope so. Their attack when and where is their advantage. - Yeah, Lieutenant. Sometimes they're as uncivilized as we are. (somber music) - It fits all right, Lieutenant, but I got a feeling it just ain't smooth enough. - Well we'll just have to try it, Tin Pot. Worst we can do is let the man know he's in or trouble. - We'll try it. (clicking) (thudding) Ah. Just ain't right. Like everything else. (somber music) - All right, now give me that pin. - What? - Don't hand me that, I want the pin to the Gatling gun. - What're you talking about? How would I know about such things? - Just as thick with Trapper as you are with me. He knew that gun better than anyone. Get back! With Lieutenant there's a trial. Anything can happen! - All I wanted the gold and you. - To hell with the gold! I want that pin! - I don't have the pin! - The Apache means to kill me no matter what! It's not good if we can't spend it, lover! (thudding) - Please. You've got to believe me. I told you the truth. (dramatic music) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (smacking) (somber music) - Who is it? - Martha. - Miss Boland, you shouldn't be walking around in the dark. - I couldn't sleep. - You certainly look like a girl. - I may never have a chance to wear a dress again. - The Colonel's out there somewhere. He'll find us soon. - Anyway, it's too warm to wear trousers. - Uh... How's Leona? - Same. She's over there talking with Sneed. Damn it. - Something wrong? - Yes! You! (dramatic music) I don't know how you Yankees ever won the war. Jim! No! (thudding) (foreboding music) - Lieutenant, over here! Sneed's escaped. I found her like this. Only she was unconscientious. This was lying beside her. - He got loose. He tried to get me to go with him. I refused, so he hit me. - Martha, you bring her. You, come with me. Runner! - Lieutenant. What's going on out there? - Mr. Boland, if Two-Knife finds out that our Gatling doesn't work, we're through. Sneed just escaped. I'm sure he's gonna tell him. Come on. - One of out sentry's been knifed. (guns cranking) (ominous music) - [Wayne] Take cover! (gunshots booming) (Apaches hooting) (suspenseful music) (gunshot booming) (arrow swishing) (screaming) (gunshots booming) Hold your fire! I think they're gone for now. (water trickling) Hold up! Runner, you drive. Jim! - Yup? - [Wayne] Get the women up in there. Tie up, you're gonna take the wheel. - Yes, sir. (foreboding music) (Jim shouting) Get! Get up there! Get on up! Go! (somber music) - How long you figure he's been with us, Lieutenant? - Three, maybe four hours. - He's been dogging us like a buzzard. - Waiting for us to kill over. And he ain't got long to wait. - Well let's move out. - Are you all right? (huffing) - I wish we could stop and rest for awhile. - He's crazy. Pushing us like this. What're you trying to do, Wayne, kill us? The women can't take this pace. We gotta stop. - I know that. But look up there. - But they can't walk, they haven't eaten anything. They don't have the strength to go on. - Jim, if we stop now, all those women have got to look forward to is rape and murder. We've gotta find some place we can get our back against a wall. Defend ourselves. All right, we'll stop for five minutes. Hold up. Runner, come on with me. (foreboding music) (sighing) - Lieutenant. There. (ominous tempo music) - [Jim] Up, come on, hey! (men shouting) (foreboding music) - There's plenty protection here. - I like it, Lieutenant. I think you picked the right spot. You get a good view from almost everywhere up here. - Yeah. There's a little rock spring back there. Only the men go for water. Jim, you and Runner go first, fill up the canteens. (ominous music) (groaning) (sinister music) (speaking foreign language) - I tried... We tried to bring you the Gatling! They were on to us, we didn't know! - You have failed. My warriors have died because you have failed! And we still don't have King Gun! - But I came looking for you to tell you! (smacking) (shouting foreign language) (groaning) - Now we will see if your spirit will live as long as your body! Or will you scream cries of a coward until my warriors kill you?! - No, Two-Knife! I've got something to tell you, something important! That's why I'm here! - What do you say? - First you've got to promise you'll let me go. Maybe give me some of the gold. It's a way to capture Malcolm and the Gatling! I swear, it's true! - True? What do you say that's true?! - To save my life? - Leona told me you were a man of your word. You give me your word I can go free and I'll tell you how to get to Gatling. Easy, very easy! The truth, the Gatling doesn't work. They're something wrong with it. That's why it was never used against you! All you needed was an all out attack! - For Wayne - Oh, sure. Plenty of 'em. - Thanks. Hungry? - What is that? - What else? - I'll try to concentrate on something else. What're you gonna do when we get back to Deadwood? - Buy some more cows. Start all over, I guess. - Thought your pop was whipped out. - He still has a little bit of money in the bank. Will you be stationed at the garrison? - I never know. My troop's been moved around a lot the last couple of years. But I've got a furlough coming. I think I'll take it if... When we get out of here. - [Luke] Lieutenant? - Papa, what is it? - Lieutenant, follow me. And you stay right where you are. (ominous music) (foreboding music) (gasping) Get it out of your system, son. - What the hell are you talking about, Boland? How do you get a massacre like that out of your system? - "Massacre." Maybe you're right. But why do they call it a victory when we killed the Indians in a "massacre?!" When something like this happens?! You're dead either way, Lieutenant! - Boland, I'm just trying to do what every man has ever done! Survive! - There's a lot of ways to die! Just don't let hate eat you up! - That Indian is a murderer. (foreboding music) - Who made him a murderer? (somber music) - Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Out there. - They're sooner than I expected. - Can't count but 10. They must've missed Sneed. - Yeah, but don't bet on it. Too bad he's part fox, part wolf. Not about to trust anyone. That's just a feeler bunch. You all keep your eyes on them. - Lieutenant, come here, I wanna show you something. - Everybody take positions. - It works, Lieutenant, I got it, I got it! You see, the pin fits. Gatling gun ready for firing, sir. (chuckling) (ominous music) (clicking) - I hope you're right, Tin Pot. - Aren't you gonna give me a gun to help? - Help who? (foreboding tempo music) (gun clicking) Everybody hold your fire. (horse grunting) It's all yours, Tin Pot. Now! (rapid gunfire popping) (Apaches hooting) (rapid gunfire popping) (sighing) What's the matter? - Oh, the pin's broke, damn it. The heat done it. I got nothing to temper it with. - That gun's useless? Well, they don't know it. (crickets chirping) - [Luke] All right, Lieutenant, out with it. You've got something on your mind and it isn't poking that fire. (sighing) - Von Clausewitz's "Theory of War." - Clausewitz? Sounds like one of them new patented medicine syrups. - What's the first and only thing those Apaches expect us to do? - I'd say they'd want us to stay right here until they've figured out some way to get at us. - Mm-hmm. - [Luke] So what're you getting at? - Attack. - Attack? With seven men, Lieutenant? - Well, if we got lucky, my people would scatter their horses, probably even get a couple of 'em. - Well that could makes sense because then they would have to fight us on foot. - [Wayne] Right. - Yeah, we could pick 'em off with our rifles. It's worth a try, Lieutenant. We'd be in a better position. - Anything is better than to wait here till the end. - Do you have any more of those cigars? (chuckling) - The way it looks now, Lieutenant, more than I'll ever be able to smoke. Have one. - Runner, how's our ammunition? - More than we'll ever use. - We'll take the lead out of the cartridges, pour the powder into something. You have any cans, bottles? - If I got beans, I got cans, and I got nothing but beans. (military drumming music) - This ought singe their feathers, Lieutenant. - It should. You tell Jim he needs to stay here in the camp and guard the women. - Right, sir. (foreboding music) (horse huffing) (thudding) (horses grunting) - There, Lieutenant. - Sneed. - He must've told 'em the gun didn't work. - Well let's light those cigars. (ominous music) Light up. (sizzling) Got it. - Okay. - Now! (explosions booming) (horses neighing) (hooves thundering) (booming) (gunshots booming) (explosions rumbling) - Let's get out of here. (gunshots booming) - Hey, Lieutenant! Tin Pot's been hit! - You all right? - I'm moving, ain't I? - All right, let's get to the horses. (distant gunfire booming) (gunshots booming) (gun cranking) (gunshots booming) (booming) (groaning) (gunshots booming) (somber guitar music) - Jim, I'm leaving. Will you come with me? - No, you're not going anywhere. - Come with me, look, you'll die here. It's only a matter of time and I can save us. Look, I know Two-Knife. Come with me. - Leona, I can't let you go. Don't you understand? - I'm going, Jim. - Come back here. - Would you shoot me? - Oh, just-- - Would you shoot me? - No! Leona! (gunshot booming) (foreboding music) - [Leona] Jim! (dramatic music) (foreboding music) - Boland, get the horses behind the rocks. Let's get up to the high ground. Everybody take cover. Two-Knife's gonna be right on our heels. (somber music) - Oh no, what happened? - Get him out of here! - I'm all right, just a scratch. Here they come, here! (horse hooves clattering) - Boy. - [Wayne] Hold your fire. - Hey, Jim. Jim? You're gonna be all right. They can't... They can't kill a Boland, Jimmy. Jim. Son. No! No! No! This is my only boy. Jim. (suspenseful music) (Apaches hooting) - [Wayne] Fire! (gunshots booming) (Apaches hooting) (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) (groaning) (Apaches hooting) (sinister music) (huffing) (yelling foreign language) (booming) (distant war commotion) (booming) - Stupid! (yelling foreign language) (gunshots booming) (somber music) (huffing) (gunshots booming) - [Luke] Martha! - Keep firing! (gunshots booming) (booming) Come on! - Wait, the pin! - Come on, let's get up there! (gunshots booming) (yelling) (booming) (screaming) (gunshots booming) - Keep on the alert! We'll really turn them back on the next charge! Tin Pot, I got the pin. How long? - Just give me a minute, Lieutenant, and then we'll have a real surprise for them. (clacking) - Come on! Come on! - Who's waiting on who? It's all yours, Lieutenant. (distant gunfire) (Apaches hooting) (rapid gunfire popping) (ominous music) (rapid gunfire popping) (horse neighing) - Attack! Attack! (rapid gunfire popping) (suspenseful music) (rapid gunfire popping) (rapid gunfire popping) (suspenseful music) (rapid gunfire popping) (Apaches hooting) (rapid gunfire popping) (booming) (explosion rumbling) (horses screeching) (rapid gunfire popping) (explosions rumbling) (wind howling) (Apaches hooting) - What do you think, Lieutenant? - I don't know. They didn't have a chance against this gun. (ominous music) (horse neighing) - Runner, what's Wayne doing out there alone? - You ever seen a Calvary officer who wasn't a professional volunteer, Mr. Boland? They all think they're Custer. (sinister music) (gun cranking) (ominous music) (gun clicking) (melancholy music) (dramatic music)
