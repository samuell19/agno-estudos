Workers in unit 4, earthquake! Evacuate immediately! Stay calm and leave the building! Run! Keep moving! Hey! "Units 1 & 2 operations building 2f control room" watch out! Don't move! "Toshio izaki, operations management shift supervisor" you know the drill! Yes, sir! Stay low! Be safe! Yes, sir! "Safety rules: Stop, cool, seal" unit 1, half scram! Unit 2, half scram! Unit 1, scram! Unit 2, scram! Cr, all in! Control rods, all in, check! "Reactor power output" "masao yoshida, fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant manager" Is everyone ok? Are you ok? Is everyone ok? Each team take a roll call, and check to see if anyone is missing or injured. Yes, sir! - I'm going to the emergency response room! - Okay. - Check the parameters! - Yes. Unit 1, water level, 900! Pressure, 6.6! Check! We've lost external power! Check! Close msiv! Main steam isolation valve closed! "Diesel generator" dg activated! Diesel generator activated! Eccs, standby! Emergency core cooling system, standby! Check if the cooling system works. Steady, now. Tell me if something is wrong! Yes, sir! - Activate cooling system! - Yes, sir! Mode switch shut down! Cooling system activated! Check! Subcritical, confirmed! "Cooling system activated" "seismic isolation building" "emergency response room" - chief. - Did you scram? Units 1, 2 and 3 were all shut down. - Good, report to the hq office. - Okay. Upper 6 in seismic intensity. Upper 6 on the seismic intensity scale: Central miyagi, nakadori in fukushima, hamadori in fukushima... Everyone! Under these unusual circumstances, be steady. Check and proceed one by one. Don't panic. Yes, sir. Hello. You're here! That was huge! Came to help. Thank you. - Thanks, guys! - Sure. The emergency power is on? So far so good. Okuda, stop the alarm. One moment. Mr. lzaki, it's Mr. yoshida. Izaki speaking. Are you ok over there? We're fine so far. There's a mega-Tsunami warning. Ok, got it, yoshi. "Yoshi"? They're the same age. Guys, mega-Tsunami warning! We should be safe here. It's 10m above sea level. - Watch out for the sea water pumps! - Yes. - Get the Tsunami safety manuals ready! - Yes. "Unit 2 reactor / unit 1 reactor" Mega-Tsunami warning. If you're near the ocean, evacuate now. "Seismic isolation building" mega-Tsunami warning. If you're near the ocean, evacuate now. "Units 1 & 2 control room" mega-Tsunami warning. If you're near the ocean, evacuate now. Let's hurry. We don't have to hurry. What's that? Tsunami? Tsunami! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Hey! - What? - What's going on? "54 minutes after quake" the generator tripped! The power is out! Unit 1, sbo, station black out! Unit 2, sbo! All power lost. What? The power is out? Chief! Chief. What, lzaki? Sbo. This is applicable to article 10. Units 3 and 4, also sbo! Act on special measures concerning nuclear emergency preparedness, art. 10. Fukushima daiichi, station black out. Sbo. We invoke article 10, obligation to notify a nuclear emergency. Why did the power go out? Find out why! Yes, sir! "Tokyo" "222km away from fukushima" article 10 at fukushima daiichi! No way. What's article 107? Wakatsuki, what the hell? Fukushima daiichi invoked article 10. The emergency response central office will take over from now. Move! "Tokyo electric power co. Hq emergency reponse central office" - Is the unit 1 cooling system on? - Don't know. There's no way of knowing without power. It'll be a disaster if they're not cooled. What's going on? Oh my god! - What? - It's bad! We're in deep trouble! A Tsunami! It's a Tsunami! A Tsunami? Bring towels! Seawater is in the building! The generator's underwater? That's why the power's out. Mr. yoshida! It was a Tsunami! A Tsunami reached the buildings? It was larger than expected. No power and the meters aren't working. We need power. Tell hq we need power-supply cars. Yes, sir! And... Fire trucks. Fire trucks? What for? Idiot, to cool the reactors! Pumps don't work without power! Water cannons will help. Hurry. Yes, sir! Summon fire trucks! Everyone listen up. It's not safe, but we must go check the reactors. We don't know what's going on in there. You know the rules when going to the site. Everyone has to be paired at all times. That's the first rule. Return in an hour or we'll come for you. Even if you don't get there, come back before an hour passes. And write down the times you went in and out on this board. - Got it? - Yes, sir. Careful with unit 1. It's U.S.-made and tricky. Yes, sir. If the power isn't restored, the water in the reactor will dry up and overheat. Then it's a matter of time before the fuel melts. The melted fuel will break out of the containment vessel. Core meltdown. Meltdown... Radiation will be released, we'll all be exposed and it's over. We have to inject water into the reactors to prevent that. We can use the fire-fighting pipeline to send water. We have to open 5 valves. Mr. yoshida. Izaki's team is working on the fire protection system to send water. We think alike. Without pumps, only fire trucks can feed water. Mr. yoshida! Two fire trucks are down because of the Tsunami. And the third? It works but wreckage is preventing it from moving. Do whatever it takes! Yes, sir! Only one truck isn't enough! Tell hq to contact the self-defense forces for more. Yes, sir! Attention please! If you can lend us your car battery to power the instruments in the control room, please come here! Please! We need batteries! Please! - All of them? - Yes. "1 hour 50 minutes after quake" they've lost all power and can't cool the reactors. "Prime minister's office, crisis management center" how did that happen? The Tsunami. Everything's underwater. Weren't they prepared? It was bigger than expected. What now? The reactors will overheat if they're not cooled! Don't you have details? What's the safety agency doing? Well... my apologies! Any plans? We're working on countermeasures. What countermeasures? Give me details! You're the director-general of the nuclear safety agency! You're in charge! But I... Do you understand technical details? I majored in economics at university... Prime minister! Mr. takemaru of Tokyo electric is here. Where's the president? Sorry, he's away on a business trip. Business trip? Yes, he had some meetings out west. He's on his way. And the chairman? Sorry, he's in China on business... The top two are gone? We're so sorry. "Omori kano" "2 hours 33 minutes after quake" "units 1 & 2 operations building" let's go. Yes, sir. 1.2 1.2, huh? "Unit 1 reactor building" - This way. - Yes. "Water pipe" - Switch to manual mode. - Yes. Valve 365, opened. Valve 365 opened, check. Valve 25a is open. Valve 25a opened, check. We can send in water now. Yes. - You ok? - Bring water! Good work! Radiation was 1.2msv near the double doors. Something is wrong in unit 1. The reactor water level could be low. Radiation in the unit 1 building is 1.2msv/hr. Something might be malfunctioning in unit 1. High radiation level in unit 1. 1.2msv/hr. Higuchi, aren't the power-supply cars being flown in? - I'm working on it! - Faster! Yes I know that. Hold on, geez. We're calling it off! "4 hours 3 minutes after quake" the power-supply cars were too heavy to lift. "Emergency helicopter pad" what now? Under discussion. But this is canceled. Canceled! Canceled! Helicopters aren't coming. Canceled! Canceled! No helicopters! "4 hours 59 minutes after quake" "prime minister's office, press conference room" Today, at 16:36, there was an event at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant. It falls under the act on special measures concerning nuclear emergency preparedness article 15, paragraph 1, item 2. We recognize that this situation requires an emergency response to stop further expansion of nuclear hazard, so in accordance with regulations a state of emergency has been declared. At the moment, oh, grandpa, I'll do that. Haruka, put broken things in this. "Izaki residence, tomioka town" ok. No reports of major problems, so please stay calm... State of emergency, huh? Your father will be fine. He's been there for decades. Yeah. Residents must evacuate. Don't panic, stay calm and promptly evacuate. "6 hours 4 minutes after quake" don't panic, stay calm and promptly evacuate. "Residents within a 2km radius of the plant ordered to evacuate" I repeat... Why must we evacuate? Why do we have to leave? Trouble at the plant? I don't know. Just go quickly. Good, it worked. "Futaba town office" there's a traffic jam there. Can't get through to daiichi? Not yet. Got through to daini! Daiichi still doesn't have power. No power? What the hell? Chief! The government is sending 60 buses for evacuation! It's too late now! What are we going to do about iodine? Hq, we need clear guidance! As per the regulation of the nuclear safety commission, younger people should take it, but those over 40 don't have to. But it's unfair to draw that line if they're all going in. The radiation level is rising. We can't approach if it gets higher. Those on-site are risking their lives! Decide! Mr. yoshida, give us time. We'll ask the nuclear safety commission. Hq can't even handle this? The power-supply vehicles are here! We can do this! How did this happen? The voltage is different. We needed high-voltage but the vehicles we got were low. What the hell is hq doing? Idiots! Thanks. Hurry, nishikawa! - I am! - Don't talk back. Can't we connect a cable from the seismic isolation building? It's 350m away. Too far. It'll take days to set up that heavy cable. Steady, now. Next! You have batteries? Thank you. Nishikawa, I can't see! Sorry. Miyamoto, it's connected! Got it! Here it comes. Mr. lzaki, the pressure indicator is working! What does it say? 600 kilopascals. 600kpa? The containment vessel's pressure limit is 427kpa. 1.5 times more. It could burst at any time. We have to vent. Vent... Unit 1, containment vessel pressure, 600kpa. 6007? What? We have to depressurize unit 1. Get ready to vent. Check the other plants. Yes, sir. Izaki, it's me. Yoshi. How long will the reactor last? Until morning at best. When there's too much pressure, this vessel will explode. To prevent that, it's necessary to release some pressure. "10 hours 6 minutes after quake" that's called venting. But doesn't that mean the surrounding area will be contaminated? If it explodes, even more radiation will contaminate all of eastern Japan. Of course we'll make sure residents are evacuated before venting. And the released air will travel through water in this suppression chamber. So the amount of radiation should be reduced to about 0.1 percent. "Should be"? Venting has never been performed anywhere before. First time ever? Yes. But the power is out so it has to be done manually. Someone must go inside the contaminated reactor building. Don't say that so easily! You know how dangerous it is to vent with no electricity! I know that! But we've no choice. We already told the pm. Of course, we'll handle the venting responsibly. We're already on it. But don't say things without consulting with us first! We'll decide how and when. Calm down! God damn it! Izaki speaking. Izaki. Please do it. Got it. We have to hurry. Decide who will go in to do the venting. Yeah. Guys. We're venting unit 1. This means releasing radiation into the vicinity. We have to decide who'll go. As we all know, the building is dark and we don't know what's going on. The radiation level is high. So I can't send the young ones in. If you're willing to volunteer, please raise your hand. Is there anyone willing to come with me? I'll go in. You stay here, lzaki. He's right. You stay here and take command. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go, too. - I'll go, too. - Me too. I can do it. I'll go. Thank you. Thank you all. But not the young ones. Please let me choose 3 pairs of 6 veterans. At fukushima daiichi, "fukushima daiichi, 3km radius evacuation zone" the pressure inside the containment vessel is rising so they're going to release some pressure by opening the valves. "12 hours 20 minutes after quake" when's that happening? We've told the site to aim for 3 A.M. to carry it out. It's already past 3 A.M. Uh, I meant they're getting started around 3 A.M. I've been told they've begun the process, so I'll go back and check on their progress. I'm hashiguchi at fukushima minyu. Have you informed the nearby residents? We're working on it. I'll go back and check on that, too. We regret causing inconvenience to residents, but we'll follow the nuclear regulation authority's directions. Oh, over here! We open the mo valve on the 2nd floor of unit 1 and the ao on top of the suppression chamber. Igawa and I will go in first and open the mo valve. We'll open the ao. Mr. hirayama and matsuda wait here. - Got it. - Yes. "1. Omori, igawa, 2. Kudo, yano, 3. Hirayama, matsuda" again, "14 hours 58 minutes after quake" residents within a 10km radius of the plant must evacuate. "Tomioka town office" don't panic, everyone. Please get on the bus. Again, "residents within a 10km radius of the plant ordered to evacuate" residents must evacuate. Please get on the bus. Please don't push. What's going on? Where are we going this time? I'm not sure myself. Just please get on for now. What about the radiation? What's happening at the plant? Tell us! I don't know! Just get on the bus for now. Please. This is an emergency announcement from tomioka town. The fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant has... What are you doing, grandpa? We have to hurry. Hurry. Keizo, big trouble over at daiichi, eh? We'll be able to come home soon. Toshio will handle it. Right. Let's go. Father. Ready? Go, haruka. Ok. Got everything we could find. Thanks. Thanks. Put them over there. We can go anytime. Ok. We're ready. Please wait. We still don't know if all residents have evacuated. Wait. Mr. yoshida, may I have a word? "15 hours 4 minutes after quake" yoshida speaking. Can we vent now? The pm is headed that way. The pm? Now? Please handle it. Good god. Give us a break. We're stretched thin. It's been decided, so please handle it. Mr. yoshida. I understand. But hq should provide masks for the pm's delegation. No, take care of that on your side. There aren't enough. The workers are already sharing. We have no leeway. We don't either. You handle it. Damn you! Do you want us to die? Figure something out if you don't have any! We're too busy! Yoshida, follow orders for Christ's sake! So you want us to wait until the pm leaves before venting, right? Why didn't you stop him? I did. No use. It's no joke if he's exposed. "15 hours 14 minutes after quake" make sure he's not. Yes, but who knows what'll happen... Please entrust me with full authority during your absence. Very well. The biggest problem is decay heat. What? Decay heat! If we don't cool it with water, the fuel will melt down. China syndrome. What happens if the fuel melts? Heated metal and water will react and generate hydrogen. What's happening now? It's probably reached the vessel. If hydrogen is generated, it'll explode. That's why we have to hurry and vent. To let the pressure out. "Front gate, fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant" thank you. "Japan ground self-defense force" jgsdf camp koriyama, 6th artillery regiment. I'm sergeant major henmi. We've brought fire trucks. Please wait. But they're at the front gate! What? Why? I see. Sorry, we have to ask you to wait. The pm is here. Prime minister? "16 hours 25 minutes after quake" Good morning, sir. Why haven't you vented? Venting. Why haven't you done it? Well, that's... What's wrong with you? The air dose rate is very high. Decontaminate your gear, put it in a bag and hold on to it. Good morning. Remove your shoes and hold them. The staff over there will test for contamination. Why do you think I'm here? I don't have time for this! But this is... Just your shoes, then. Wear these. What's the level? 0.3msv. The unit 1 level is rising, so move near unit 2. Hurry. What's going on? We're trying to vent without electricity and having some problems on site. What kind of problems? Let me explain. Please see here. This area was submerged because of the Tsunami. Water came into the building so we lost power. The core cooling system is just barely working. What about the venting? We're working on it. But the valves won't open without electricity, so we'll try to open them manually. Just make it happen asap. Certainly. We've assembled a suicide squad. A suicide squad? Is the pm still here? He's meeting with Mr. yoshida. Lift it up more! "Disaster relief" The water tank's beside this building. Outlet's over there. Got it. Connect the trucks and start pumping. Go! Yes, sir! Run! Hurry! Watch your step! Hurry! All residents have evacuated. "18 hours 18 minutes after quake" "evacuation of all residents in the vicinity confirmed" Yes? It's me. Sorry for the delay. Start venting. Got it. We have the order. Commence venting. Yes, sir. The survey meter Max is 1,000. If it hits 1,000, you have to come back right away. We know. I set all the alarms on the dosimeters for 80msv. Whoa. Never seen that before. Serious stuff. The oxygen tank only lasts 20 minutes. That's enough. Don't overdo it, Mr. omori. I know. "Omori, igawa: 9:11 A.M." We're off. Thank you. Radiation level? 600, so far so good. It's been 5 minutes. Cables connected to the power panel. We can start injecting if the pump works. Switching on the breaker. Yes, sir. 3,2,1, 0! It's connected! It's connected! - Connecting! - Ok! "Water outlet" donel! Ok, ok! I see it! Oki - ready over here! - Check! - Let's do it! - Check! Commence injection! Commencing! It's here. Let's go. There it is. This is it. "Ac pcv venting valve / mo valve unit 1" valve number mo 210. This is the one. Let's go. 11 minutes passed! Opening! Open it 25 percent! It's at 5 percent! 10 percent! 15 minutes! "Keizo lzaki b.1927/12/21, tomoko lzaki b.1960/4/23, haruka lzaki b.1987/1/14" 25 percent! It's open! It's open! Look, look! It's open 25 percent! It's open. We did it! Water's going in! It'll cool down now! It'll cool down! Water's going in! Water's going in. 19 minutes. The tanks only last 20 minutes. Mr. lzaki? - Hey! - Mr. 1zaki! - Mr. lzaki! - No! Mr. lzaki! Wait! It's open! It moved, it's open! We did it! Yeah! Bring water! Yay! Great job! It was so hot. The mo valve is open! Oh! Yay! Please send in the second team. Toss everything in the bags! Hurry! Mr. Honda. Mr. omori, 25mswv. Mr. igawa, 20msv. That much in only 20 minutes? "Kudo, yano: 9:38 A.M." Team 2, going in. Thank you. Hey, kudo. It's at the suppression chamber. Radiation levels are high. Good luck. Yes, sir! Ok. Let's do it. Let's go. "Reactor building, first basement level torus room" it's hot. 500. It's 500! Let's go. It's 900! We'll keep going until the Max. Hang in there. We're close. 1,000msv. We can't go any further! 30 more meters. Almost there. We can't! Come on! Mr. yano, we're going back! We can do this! They'll be ok. Thank you. - Mr. kudo! - Mr. yano! What happened? We failed! The radiation was too high! And we were so close! The meter hit the Max! I'm s 0 r ry! I'm s 0 r ry! This way! Bring water! Get their gear off! Excuse me. Mr. yano. Excuse me. Mr. lzaki! Their radiation doses... Are 89 and 95. That's nearly the emergency limit of 100! Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Mr. lzaki. Let me go again. No, Mr. yano. You were both highly exposed. You could've died if you'd stayed longer. Take them to the seismic isolation building now. Yes, sir. I'm sorry. Let me go in! It's all right. I'm ss 0 rry! It's all right. So they couldn't... The radiation level is too high to go in. What if try opening the valve remotely by sending in air? Will that work? We have to try everything. Yes, sir. Mr. lzaki. Takumi! You came! Units 5 and 6 are stable now so we came. You too. Yes. Heard you're trying again. Suicide squad, right? The level is high here, so how about a detour? Yes, it'll take longer but should work if we hurry. Mr. hirayama, do you know where the valve is? I'll manage. I know. I'll go. What? I worked at unit 1 for 10 years. I know everything about the ao valve. I understand unit 1's quirks the best. No. Do you get how deadly it is in there? Nobody younger than me should go in. I feel as though I was trained by unit 1. It made me what I am as a plant engineer. No! The reactors aren't just machines. Like kids, some are mischievous and some are manageable. The most difficult one here is unit 1, right? Exactly. I want to save it with my own hands. Please let me go! Get them changed. - Yes. Let's get to it. - Ok, quickly. Let's hurry! They're from our high school. They can do it. Kana? Tomoko. Are you ok? Yes. Oh, I got these for you. Thank you. How nice. Have you spoken to takumi? No. I can't reach him on his phone. What about Mr. lzaki? Well, he should be ok... They're both pros. Yes. "Massive earthquake in east Japan" "worst in history" "mega-Tsunami" the water level was 44 meters”? "Tomioka town evacuation center" quit smoking. Just one. The desk for missing persons and safety confirmation is inside. "23 hours 44 minutes after quake" izaki speaking. Smoke's coming out from the stack! Smoke? Stop them! Something's happening! Stop them! A mask! A mask! Mr. kano! Mr. Honda! Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Why are you stopping us? We're going to open the valve! Just come back! Let go, damn it! It's an order! Abort the mission! Come back! Smoke from venting? We used the compressor to open the valve remotely. Venting accomplished! Then tell us first! You want to kill my men? We're risking our lives! I know that! We're racking our brains over here too! Damn it! What happened? Venting accomplished. Sent in air with the compressor. So it worked. But I have mixed emotions. It spread radiation outside. I wonder if my mom evacuated. It's a lot better than the vessel blowing up. Yeah, let's look on the bright side. You're right. The radiation level inside unit 1 is higher now. It's impossible to go in. I wonder what's happening in the reactor? A meltdown has begun, probably. A meltdown... It's over if the vessel breaks. What's the point in us staying here? What do you mean? There's nothing we can do in this situation. So why bother staying? Nishikawa! And you consider yourself a plant engineer? The radiation level is getting higher and we're in danger! Who'll protect this reactor if we run away? We're not. Instead of wasting time here, we retreat to the seismic isolation building and return with some kind of plan... There must be a better way! We can't leave because anything could happen! But we're dying for nothing! You...! How dare you! Hey, calm down! Stop, yamagishi! We'd be abandoning the entire area of the plant if we retreat. Listen. The residents who evacuated left their homes in the hopes that we'd manage to bring this under control. I was born here and raised here. I'll do anything to save it. You have family here. I do, too. We don't know what'll happen from now. But in the end, we're the last ones to deal with it on-site. It's up to us to save our hometown. So I can't leave. I think it's worth staying if only to monitor the meters. We can't give up on controlling the reactor. No matter what Mr. yoshida says, I'll make you evacuate first. Please understand. Please. "24 hours 50 minutes after quake" Masks! Put on masks! Masks! Masks! Check parameters! Hurry! Calm down! It exploded! It exploded! Explosion in unit 1! Retreat! Are you ok? Are you ok? You ok? I'll help. Can you stand? Let's get up. Not in here! Retreat! No, get out! Get out of here! Check the power cable! The power cable was damaged! What? We finally had some electricity but now we have to start over. Breaking news. There has been an explosion at fukushima daiichi. This footage is from today... What? What exploded? The containment vessel? I'll find out. The camera captured smoke erupting from the plant. Details of the explosion are still unknown. What's going on? Hey, big trouble! The plant exploded! It's over. Nobody could've survived. They must all be dead. They shouldn't have built a plant there! What will happen? We'll never be able to go home. No way! Hey! Take down these curtains! Nothing is celebratory! Hey, you! Take them down! Excuse us. You should take this off. Thank you. Mr. yoshida. We're almost out of fresh water. Then we have to inject seawater. "Soma odaka shrine prayer for protection" Hello, haruka? Finally! Are you all right? I'm fine. How are things in aizu? We're fine over here. But what about your dad? That guy's probably doing fine. Haruka. I know. Dad! Dad! Watch your step. Cool down, haruka! I am cool. You're the one being emotional. You'll have a hard time. How do you know? I just do. He's 16 years older, divorced and has a kid. It won't work out. Don't assume that. I'm ok with it, so it's ok. I'm not ok with it! Huh? Don't be childish. I raised you for 24 years. What for? Give me one, dad. Letting you choose your path, sending you to university... Tomoko, what have I worked so hard for? To give my only daughter away to some 40-year-old? I can't let you young ones stay anymore. Retreat immediately. Don't worry, old guys are tough. We've lived half a century, after all. Let's go. This is our last moment. Let's take photos. Don't say stuff like that. Mr. kano first. Here goes. Say cheese. Mr. omori. You next. This could become my funeral photo, so make me look good. A funeral photo in a full-faced mask? Befits a plant operator. If we die, it'll be considered "in the line of duty." "Die in the line of duty"? Sounds cool, like a detective drama. Don't be ridiculous. Do you get what it means to die from radiation exposure? Have you forgotten the tokaimura nuclear accident? "Accident at nuclear facility" "310,000 residents stay indoors" 2 workers died. The cells all over your body die. "Awful" isn't enough to describe it. Sorry. A group shot. Let's take one together. Hurry, hurry. Mr. matsumoto, you gained weight again! Electricity generated here will be sent to Tokyo. Cool, huh? You don't have to work away from home anymore, dad? "Iwaki army airfield site" yeah. I'll work at an affiliate company of the plant. Then you'll be home on new year's? Let's go to the shrine together. This is a nuclear containment unit. Big, isn't it? Wow. It's a boiling water reactor. The heat from fission reactions boils water to produce steam, and that steam produces electricity. Nuclear power produces massive energy at low cost. And it's clean energy that doesn't emit carbon dioxide. It's the energy of the future. Wait, wait. Here goes! "27 hours 39 minutes after quake" "residents within a 20km radius of the plant ordered to evacuate" close your window. "28 hours 39 minutes after quake" takemaru here. What's the status of the seawater injection? We're doing it. What? Really? We're injecting it. You've already started? "Front of unit 3 building" what's the matter? That's not good. What do you mean? Just stop injecting! Why? We can't stop now. Oh, shut up! The pm's office is complaining again. Pm's office? What are you saying? Do you know what'll happen if we stop? Impurities. Huh? They're saying impurities in seawater may cause a recriticality accident. I've never heard of such a thing. Just stop doing it. The priority is to keep cooling it by any means available! Explain that to them! Yoshida, this is an order! We're not stopping. They want us to stop injecting? The government is butting in. Why is hq letting them? Laymen should shut up! Sasaki. Yes, sir. Hq might order us to stop injecting seawater. Got that? Yes, sir. Good thing we had seawater in the pit. Yes, but I wonder how long it'll last. Hope we can keep injecting. Water is going into unit 1. Thank god! Great! Thank god. Report any problems with water pressure or level. Mr. yoshida. Yes, sir. The pm's office is saying it's too soon to inject seawater, so please stop. Understood. Sasaki. Yes, sir! Stop injecting seawater. Abort mission. Yes, sir. Hq. I'm going to pee. Ok. Commencing injection! Mr. mochizuki, it'll take at least 5 hours for the power to recover. Injection is stable now, so we'll help. - Thank you. - Let's go. Oh god, the smell! Sorry, sorry! Sorry for making you help in the men's room, Ms. asano. It's ok, someone's got to do it. But oh god, it smells! Water's not running. Igawa. "49 hours 16 minutes after quake" is unit 2's rcic operating? Plus 3,750. The cooling system's working. Yes? Unit 3's radiation level is rising fast. It might explode. Abort all outdoor missions. Everyone except those collecting data come to the seismic isolation building. We'll take turns in the control room. Izaki, you come back too and report what's going on. I can't leave. You know what's going on the best. This is an order. - We'll stay here. - Please go, Mr. lzaki. Mr. yoshida gave orders for 5 men to take turns here from now on. Oh my god. It's like an air strike. The radiation level is rising! Stop working and evacuate to the seismic isolation building! The radiation level is rising! Evacuate quickly! Evacuate quickly! The radiation level is rising! Decontaminate over there. Radiation survey over here! Good work, everyone. Mr. lzaki, it must have been so hard. Thanks for your efforts, Ms. asano. You both haven't slept, have you? - We're fine. - See? Mr. lzaki. Good work. Chief, 5 men stayed and 12 have returned. Mr. omori, thanks for your efforts. You too, Mr. hirayama. Good job. Rest up a bit, guys. Please. "64 hours 14 minutes after quake" Mr. yoshida. We have to get ready to vent unit 2, and have to pump water with the fire trucks and work on restoring power. Why not send workers back outside? We don't know when units 2 and 3 could explode. The pressure level in the containment vessel is stabilizing. Resume working. What if we can't vent and the vessel explodes? It's all over. We've been sending you the data. The radiation levels are too high! You're lucky you can just say whatever. Stop talking back and do it! We'll take full responsibility. Then come see for yourself, dumb-ass! Higuchi. Yes. I'm sorry. Could you go again? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Set them up. Ok, everyone, let me explain over here. "68 hours 15 minutes after quake" contact the control room and check! Anyone injured? Check parameters! Hq! Hq! We have a situation! It's unit 3! Unit 3 exploded! Anyone injured? We're checking now. Mr. yoshida! 40 people are missing! Get a stretcher! Are you ok? One injured over here! Bring a stretcher! Are you ok? Hurry! We're here to help! Hey, hurry! Make way! Mr. yoshida, what's going on? You said it was stable! We could have died! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's too dangerous out there. You ok? I'll have to pay with my life if anyone dies. Don't say that. Get a grip! I'm going to the control room. No, the radiation level is too high out there. Wait a bit. Please. Unit 3 exploded and radiation levels are higher. Wait a while, will you? Don't bother coming over. Maeda, it's just for now. It's really ok. It's ok. Takumi, I'm on my way! I'm in charge over there! Mr. lzaki! Izaki! - No, wait! - I can't! Izaki! Grab masks! Masks! You all stay. - It's our turn! - Are you ok? We're here! It's our turn! - Mr. lzaki. - Mr. lzaki. You thought I'd abandon you? - Igawa, we're here. - Mr. omori! Matsuda. Mr. kano. Sorry to worry you. Mr. izaki, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Mr. yoshida! We've confirmed everyone's safety! Many were injured but no one died. I see. That's great. That's great. "81 hours after quake" Mr. izaki! The pressure level in the unit 2 vessel is rising! Water level? Below top of active fuel. Probably none left. It's not cooling! It's way over the limit. The pressure inside the containment vessel is 730kpa. 730kpa? That's twice the limit. This is bad. We'll try rewiring and opening the sr valve. Battery. Do whatever to keep the drywell intact. Please! If unit 2 explodes... Nobody will be able to approach this plant. We'll lose control of the reactors. The daini plant will also be off-limits and eventually, it'll break down too. 10 reactor explosions combined means 10 times bigger than chernobyl. "April 26, 1986: Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster" "4.000 dead, 116,000 residents" "within 30km radius forced to relocate" all of eastern Japan including Tokyo will be destroyed. "81 hours 25 minutes after quake" Mr. yoshida. Mr. yoshida. Just call out the unit 2 pressure and water level from now. Drywell, 740. Reactor water level, downscale. It's going to explode. Yoshida, open the sr valve! Vent the drywell! We're trying! Mr. onodera, stop disturbing us. Yoshida, just hurry up! Everyone from cooperative companies, if you aren't currently working on something directly, no need to stay here anymore. Thank you for your support. You mean this place is in serious danger? Anything could happen at any time. Please evacuate immediately. We'll fight until the end. And the jsdf, thank you all very much, too. Mr. yoshida, we can't evacuate when private citizens are still fighting. Our job is to protect this country. My apologies. No. Drywell, 745. Reactor water level, downscale. They're going to die. Shouldn't we evacuate them all? Yoshida, please just hurry up and vent the drywell! Mr. fukuhara, you have a minute? Chief, are you ok? Mr. yoshida? Asano. Have you called your husband? No. Why? I don't have to. Why not? We're sort of connected with each other even if we're apart. Are you bragging? Will you take responsibility? "Tokyo electric power co. Main office east entrance" - Mr. takemaru! - Give us an answer! Mr. takemaru! There are over 100,000 evacuees in fukushima! Will you take responsibility? Will you pay compensation? We'll do our best to handle it. This is fukushima minyu newpaper. What will happen to fukushima from now on? Tell us. Is there hope left for fukushima? Is there any hope... For fukushima? You're pulling out of fukushima daiichi? "85 hours 17 minutes after quake" pulling out? You're abandoning it? No, we're not... Speak up! We're not considering pulling out. If they abandon daiichi, radiation will spread. It'll be impossible to reach the daini plant and all the reactors will break. We've made calculations. "Fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant, 250km radius" about 50 million residents within a 250km radius will be displaced. "Tokyo" "Tokyo electirc power co. Underground entrance" they're here. "Tokyo electirc power co. Main office" Thank you for coming. This way please. The pm will join us in the video conference shortly. "87 hours 25 minutes after quake" Why are there so many here? There's no press here, right? You all know what's happening at the plant and what it means. The damage will be devastating. This could be the end of Japan. You can't evacuate the plant! Save it at all cost! If you evacuate, your company will surely go under. You can't run away from this! What the hell is he saying? Nobody's running away. Damn you! Executives over 60 can go and die there! I'll go, too. Chairman and president, get your acts together! You can't evacuate the plant! What the... Which one this time? You ok? Check parameters! We're on it! Batteries connected. Suppression chamber pressure, zero. Suppression chamber pressure, zero! Unit 2 suppression chamber pressure, zero. Unit 2 suppression chamber pressure, zero! Verify it! Was that unit 27 how's the containment vessel? A breach in the suppression chamber? An awful amount of radiation will leak. "Unit 2 containment vessel suppression chamber" an explosion... If the suppression chamber goes down, there's no way left to cool unit 2. It's all over. Mr. lzaki. Listen up. Everybody except the essential personnel in each team must leave. Team leaders choose the members who'll stay. Thank you, everyone. We have protective clothing and masks downstairs. Please make sure to put them on. You heard him. Leave now. I'm staying. So am I. What will you do, Mr. lzaki? Of course I'm staying. Then so will we. We'll see this through... Don't be ridiculous! You're still young. Go. We won't! This is an order! Get out! - Honda... - You'll be needed for the future. Mr. lzaki. Thank you. You taught me so much. Thank you. Mr. lzaki, I'm sorry I can't be of any help. I'm sorry. Not so fast. If I die, you're going to replace me, Honda. And if you die, then yamagishi, then komiya, then miyamoto will come. Got that? Yes, sir. Come on. Honda. Mr. lzaki. I know. You don't have to say. Please let me go, too. I'm sorry. "Magnitude 9.0 east Japan earthquake" "planned outage until April" "390,000 evacuees in 7 prefectures" "distribution of stable iodine tablets" "hydrogen explosion” "save water" I'm hungry. Shall we eat something? Yes. Tell the guys in the control room. See, here's some. Yes! See, canned food. Oh! Sweet bean cake! The "best by" date is... Still worried about your health? You're right. Anyone want rice crackers? Here are some sea biscuits. Your favorite wheat crackers. - How many? - 3 people. Ok, here. Thank you. Sorry, but please excuse me. Mom, I got a text from dad. "Haruka, I apologize." "It's your life. Live the way you want." "You have my support.” He never used emojis... Father. That idiot. No, I'm fine, don't worry. I've been eating. Yeah. We have food. Mr. nojiri, here's the data. "Study hard and become a respectable adult. From dad" thanks, man. "Take care of the kids." "You made me happy. Thank you." "Dad, apologize to my face!" Come to my wedding or I won't forgive you! Haruka" "At cape shioya" Sorry to force so much on you. Nah. Bloody piss. Welcome to the club. Thanks. Why did all these things happen? Did we make a mistake? Damn. Why does this taste so good? Mr. ota! Mr. mochizuki, please send over more hoses to unit 2, quickly. - Yes. - Let's go! The unit 2 pressure level is still high. We have to be prepared. Yes, sir. Unit 2, connected! Drywell, 765. Reactor water level, downscale. Dumping water from a helicopter? Is that effective? If fuel rods are exposed, wouldn't the water cause a steam explosion? There is that risk. And I don't know if it'll be effective. But it's necessary to show Japan's will to the world. We have to try everything! "Releasing water." The jsdf has now begun dropping water from helicopters. At 9 A.M. this morning... I appreciate the gesture, but it's like cicada piss. Can be dumped on the reactor building. 2 helicopters are currently on-site, and the air drops are expected to continue. Again... Dad... Takumi, it's connected. I'll check. Mr. lzaki! It's gone down! Pressure in the unit 2 vessel is down! How much is it? 350kpa. - It's 350. - It's gone down. The containment vessel won't break now. Great. Thank god. The drywell pressure in unit 2 is down. Really? Thank god. Unit 2! The drywell pressure is down. The drywell pressure in unit 2 is down and stable! Prime minister! The containment vessel pressure in unit 2 is down! The pressure in unit 2 is down! Mr. yoshida! A blowout panel on unit 2 has fallen and smoke is coming out! So that's why it didn't explode. But we've scattered radiation everywhere. That explosion was unit 4. I thought unit 4 was shut down. Maybe unit 3 had something to do with it. Unit 4's drywell is intact. I see... Stay alert, guys. Hold out a bit more until the next crew arrives. Yes, sir! Good, stay that way! Yes! Great! It's a miracle. Yeah. I can see my wife now. We can go home alive, Mr. lzaki. Let's go home alive. Let's ask over there. I'm takumi maeda of tomioka town. Mr. maeda of tomioka town. Let me check. I'm lzaki of tomioka town. Mr. lzaki. Let me check. Dad? Haruka. Dad! You must have worried. I'm sorry. - Is everyone ok? - Um. Mom! Mom. Dad's back. I'm back. Thank goodness. You scared us with that emoiji. Kana! Honey! Dad! Toru. It's ok now. Hey! Toshio! Mr. matsunaga. Toshio's back, everyone! Welcome back. That's great. Everyone. We've made tomioka town uninhabitable. I'm truly sorry. What are you saying? You did your best. You protected our hometown until the end. He's right. No need to apologize. Toshio, thank you for your hard work. Thank you. Grandpa! Grandpa! Dad's back. Dad. You're alive. "Spring 2014" - Permit, please. - Good day. Ok, thank you. "Road restriction/no entry: Difficult-to-return zone" "atomic energy: Energy for a bright future" "To Mr. toshio lzaki" I'm the new plant manager of daiichi starting today. "June 2010" my name's yoshida. The electricity market will become liberated from now on. Let's work hard together. Yes, sir. Welcome back! We've been waiting! Thanks. Ok, then. Yes, sir. Nice working with you again. I'm counting on you. Izaki. I may not be able to see you again, so I decided to write you this. It's already been 2 years since the accident. We both had quite a rough experience. "From masao yoshida" I thought Japan was through. That the rest was up to god or Buddha. I accepted my fate, that I was going to die there. If an accident happens, the first to die are the people at the plant. But if we die, the accident will go out of control. If we can't save employees, there's no way we could save local residents. Remember when you asked if we made a mistake? I think the answer to that question is finally within reach. We disrespected nature's power. We believed that no Tsunami over 10m would strike the plant. Without solid evidence, for over 40 years since daiichi was built. We believed we controlled nature. It was human ego. Izaki. I'm so glad you were there with me then. "On July 9, 2013, masao yoshida passed away from esophageal cancer" had things gotten any worse, I would have evacuated everyone and stayed until the end with you. I thought that you'd be willing to die with me. Yoshi. Of course I wouldn't have left you. I would have stayed until the end with you. You know what? Nobody knows why the containment vessel didn't explode even to this day. Something that terrible should never happen again. I promise, yoshi. We'll keep telling what happened at fukushima daiichi to future generations. It's the responsibility of those of us who were there. Yoshi. It's cherry blossom season again.
