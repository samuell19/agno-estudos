["Finest Hour" by Ben Green playing] [Mazzoli, VOICEOVER] I drove three days and two nights from Maryland to San Diego, all the way along asking myself again and again, why was I doing this? But there are times when thinking won't bring answers, and then suddenly an image puts it all together. When I crossed the Coronado Bridge, the answer became crystal clear. I once heard a story about a guy in Chicago who liked to jump out of airplanes. He worked as an accountant, but every weekend, he would drive out to the country and go free-fall skydiving. Somebody asked the guy why he did it. He said it was simple. He was afraid of heights. Me, I had this thing about deep water. -[Bosco] Ackerman. -Yes, sir. -[Bosco] Brantley. -Yes, sir. [Bosco] Mazzoli. -Yes, sir. -[Bosco] Haymer. Hammer... Sir. -[Bosco] Thurston. -Yes, sir! Scoot your bony ass down. Scoot. That is the worst bunch of names I've ever heard in my life, and I've lived a long time. I'm Bosco. [plane flies above] You can call me chief or you can call me sir, but don't you ever call me Bosco. You're all volunteers. We don't force anybody to be a Seal. So, at any time you can't cut it, anytime you can't do another push-up, can't run another mile, can't stand the sound of my voice one more time, all you have to do is ring that ship's bell three times, and you're disenrolled. Anybody ready to ring it now? Come on, ladies. Save yourself a ton of grief. How about you, Hammer? Why wait ten, 12, 14 weeks after I've run that smirk off your face? Do yourself a favor. Ring my bell. I'd like to, sir, but I don't know you that well. You're a tough guy, aren't you, Hammer? Yes, sir. So, all of you guys are tough guys, huh? How many of you little chest-pounders think you can kick my ass? Step forward. What's wrong with you, mister? You don't think you can kick my ass? No, sir. I know I can. [helicopter flies above] Hey, bop, re-bop, bop, bop [trainees] Hey, bop, re-bop, bop, bop Wish I was back on the blacktop [trainees] Wish I was back on the blacktop [Bosco] With my KA-BAR in my hand [trainees] With my KA-BAR in my hand [Bosco] I'm gonna be a knifin' man [trainees] I'm gonna be a knifin' man [indistinct shouting] [Bosco] Move, move! I want sugar cookies, you little chest-pounders! -[man] What are you looking at? -[Bosco] I wanna tight butt down here. I said, tight! All right! On your feet! Attention! [yelling] Back in the water! Move! [shouting] [rock music playing] [woman] Oh! Hello! Sorry. It's all right. It felt good. Want to do it again? I would... But the excitement might kill you. Bye. Somebody you know? You know, a Seal. Denver couldn't score dick all game long, and you know why? Why? Drug problem. Drug problem? They got drug. Up and down the field all day! Excuse me. "Excuse me"? I had $100 riding on that shot. Yeah? Put it on my tab. Pay now. I'm gonna kick your Cincinnati red ass. [grunts] Actually, I'm from Dayton but you don't wanna split hairs. You want your money back? Yeah. You'll get it the old-fashioned way. Earn it. Tequila. Double. [loud bangs] You took the man's dignity. Leave his money. What's your problem? You're giving the teams a bad name. You want to give the guy his money back? Fine. But you're gonna have to go through me to do it. If I want trouble, I'll look for it in the bottom of a bottle. [Hammer] A ring knocker. You know, you Annapolis boys are all alike. You don't have the balls to go up against a real sailor. [grunting] Enough said? [Bosco] I can't believe... [recruit] Permission to recover... [Bosco] My grandmother can move faster than that! You keep this up and I'm gonna put you -in the surf zone all night long! -[yelling] [Bosco] Come on, Mazzoli. You name sounds like a cheap spaghetti! Get your ass up here! [yelling] Get your ass down! Get on back down that rope! Move! Permission to recover, sir! -Permission to recover, sir! -Permission to recover, sir! [Bosco] Platoon, recover! Well, looks like a tie to me. So, no one's gonna get afternoon liberty. But I tell you what you gonna get, 'cause you did real good. Drown-proofing... A basic Seal skill. Every Seal is at home in the water. The water is his lover, his mother, his friend. I know what you're thinking. "Air, got to get some air." But you're gonna do what I tell you. Blow out all the air in your lungs and sink. When you hit the bottom, you kick off hard. When you surface, take in a deep breath and exhale, so you can go down again. Mazzoli, get him. If he wants to live, he's gonna have to exhale all that air out of his lungs. Boyle's law, ladies. The volume of gas varies conversely to the... What are you laughing at? Hammer, Mazzoli, cut that shit out! Get over here. Never... You never play games in the water. It can cost a mission. It can cost a life. You got that? I thought you two guys were the best in the class, but what you've just proven is you're the best two assholes. So, we're gonna slap some manners in you. I want you on the point in five minutes. Five minutes. [shouted commands] [Bosco] Mazzoli! Hammer! Out front! Face off! Mazzoli, measure up. We're gonna get this out of your system real quick and in a military manner. Open hand only at my command. Mazzoli. Hammer. Mazzoli. Hammer. Mazzoli. Hammer. Mazzoli. Hammer. Mazzoli. Hammer. Mazzoli. I think we should switch hands. I agree. Otherwise, we're gonna be kissing like this for the rest of our lives. [Bosco] Mazzoli. That's much better. Downright refreshing. [Bosco] Hammer. [Bosco] Hammer. Mazzoli. Hammer. All right, boys. That's enough. Attention! Right face! Double time back to the barracks. Let's move! Superman was a man of steel [trainees] Superman was a man of steel [Bosco] He ain't no match for a Navy Seal [trainees] He ain't no match for a Navy Seal [Bosco] Chief and suit got in a fight [trainees] Chief and suit got in a fight Sir, got these from the mess hall. Thank you. [man 1] And I got something for you, Mr. Hammer. Get your shit together. We've had enough. It's hard enough trying to get through this course without taking all of your crap, too. [man 1] Looks like you need an attitude adjustment. And you're just the guys to do it? I don't think so. We got more than enough for a decent blanket party. Come on, man. Cool down. You got enough for two blankets? You're taking his side? You're taking my side? We're a team. We all are. Fucking A, ringknocker. [rock music playing] You with these guys? [woman] Hammer! -How's it going? -Hey. This is for you. Come on. You wanna dance with me? Yeah. [woman laughing] Hey, Hammer. Hey, I'm right here, you know. [woman] Yeah! You probably don't remember me, but... I do. But it's not to your benefit. [Mazzoli] I thought we had a moment. Wanna dance? No. I can't compete with that. You're a hell of a lot prettier than she is. She's a friend. [Mazzoli] Great. She's dancing with my best pal. [woman] Yeah? I know him, too. Really? You know Hammer? Hammer thinks "How do you do?" are fighting words, drinks tequila like it was tax-deductible, and thinks women are life-support systems for a... But he has his moments. [Hammer] What you talking about? You. Dean-o, this is Barbara Almeyer, this is Diane Bender. Dean Mazzoli. -How you doing? -Annapolis. Annapolis Seal? That's cool. -Can I see your ring? -Sure. You know, Diane's a suborbital delivery systems analyst. She works for Northrop. I'm a rocket scientist. No shit. -[Barbara laughs] -Great. [Hammer] Barbara here is a... What is it? Go ahead. Tell him. Teacher... Of dolphins. I'm a marine biologist, actually. God... Divorced, one child. Wanna marry me? [Bosco] T.J... Now. [yelling] [chaotic gunfire] [shouting commands] [shouting] Are you wet yet? [Bosco] You still a tough guy, Hammer? -Yes, sir! -You wanna fuck with me? [yelling] I want you to give me 100 push-ups. Your belly touches that deck, you're dead. Welcome, ladies, to hell week. [Bosco] Come on! Dig in, dig in! Mazzoli, give me a face walk! -Yes, sir! -[Bosco] Now! Move it! Hammer, give me a face walk! -[Hammer] Yes, sir! -[Bosco] Move! I want your face digging up water! Move! -One! -[trainees] One! -Two! -[trainees] Two! -Three! -[trainees] Three! Okay. You ladies better not drop me. You drop me, we're gonna be paddling all the way to North Island. [Bosco] Ah, bop-a-loo-bop Seal team, baby [trainees] Ah, bop-a-loo-bop Seal team, baby [Bosco] I joined up for this Now people think I'm crazy [trainees] I joined up for this Now people think I'm crazy [Bosco] Don't look at me! Put that head in the water. Put your head in the water. Roll in that mud, frogs. [trainee] That's it. That's it! Franklin! [Bosco] Where do you think you are going? [Franklin] I'm walking! [Bosco] You sure that's what you wanna do? [Franklin] I'm out of the team. [Bosco] On your feet. Attention! [man] Come on, you girls. Stand up straight! Bunch, Class 182, secured from hell week. Dismissed! -Booyah! -[trainees] Booyah! [laughter] Ringknocker! I'm here. Can't see. -Oh, my God. -Great. Look at them. Mom, they've been sleeping for four hours. [Barbara] I know. [singing] The Seal team way [Barbara, Diane and Mazzoli] The Seal team way [Hammer] We have two hostiles incoming in an unmarked canoe. Search and destroy. Roger. Missile launch. Mom, fix it! Hammer. He sure has a way with Joshua. And with you? Diane was wondering... what the story is with you guys. [Mazzoli chuckles] No story whatsoever. Wait a minute. There's a bee right there. -Where? Get it off. -Be careful. [bee buzzes] [squeals] That's a hell of a frogman, huh? Now I see why they train you guys in underwater tactics. Let me... Let me see if I can turn this damn thing over. Maybe I can help. Is that what that is? It would be great to find out you and Hammer were actually brother and sister. Really? Separated at birth by gypsies? Yeah. Something like that. [Joshua] Mom, I'm starving. Okay. [Hammer] I'll go get us some pizza. See you guys back at the hotel. Hammer, wait. I'm... I'm coming with you. [music playing] We should go. Not... Not quite yet. What do you wanna do? I don't know. We could... kill another 85 maniacs. Damn it. Or we could cruise the main drag again... Or... we could get married. I'm game. I now pronounce you man and wife. Good luck. That will be $52.47 with the ring. You can kiss the bride now. [Barbara laughs] [wedding march playing] -[Hammer moans] -[Barbara laughs] [wedding march playing] [man on TV] Come on down. You're the next contestant... [male news reporter] ...following a rich harvest... I'm starving. Let's call room service. With Hammer driving, we ought to call the police. [both laughing loudly] [humming wedding march] [exclaims] Congratulations are in order. Yes. You're kidding, right? No, Dean. It's for real. [Hammer and Barbara laughing] [Diane] You guys really did it? [Joshua] Mom, did you get the pizzas? Yes... You. -Diane, can you believe this? -[Diane] My God. Really? [Mazzoli] Ouch. You... [man on TV] This author's father, among the school master, was one... Let's get drunk. Hey... It's great. It's great when people make decisions. I'm happy. I'm very happy. I love you, Barbara. And I love you, Hammer. I love you, Diane. You, Josh... I love you most of all. I love you, too, Dean. There you go. Baby, it's time for bed. What do you say? -Hey, ring pick-up. -[Barbara laughs] That was a nice speech. So, how's it feel? No pain so far. It was her idea. I guess we're the ones that turned out to be brother and sister. If you ever need a dolphin... [national anthem playing] [man] Lieutenant junior grade, Dean Walter Mazzoli, United States Navy. Ensign Lloyd Lawrence Hammer, United States Naval Reserve. Radio man first class, Tyrene Michael Carter. Boatswain's mate first class, Mark Crescent. United States Navy. Intelligence specialist second class, Randolph Alison Henry... [Mazzoli] Class 182! [all] Booyah! Class 182! [whooping] Greenspan. Dean, hey. I never would have made it without you, buddy. Thanks. You hung in there. It was great. Thanks... Sir. Dean? We haven't seen much of you lately. It got hectic towards the end. We missed you, especially Josh. But we'll make up for it in the next few weeks. I have orders for Portsmouth, Virginia. SDV training. Act like an adult. You didn't tell me that Dean had his advance training in Virginia. Come on. I thought we were taking our SDV here at Coronado. What the hell is this? I thought we stuck together, like buddies. Can I talk to you for a minute? So, all this buddy stuff was just some line to get us through training, is that it? No. I just need my space. You coward. It's Barbara. Enough said. [Mazzoli, voiceover] Even though Hammer and I had become the hottest team in the water, our separation was inevitable. That same day, I flew to Portsmouth, Virginia, to begin my SDV mini-sub training. In the months that followed, Hammer had quickly become the best SDV operator in the west while I developed quite a reputation for myself in the east. 2,700 miles between us, and our rivalry still continued. I'm gonna miss you. I'll miss you, too. [Mazzoli, voiceover] During that time, I spoke to Hammer and Barbara only once or twice over the phone. We never mentioned what happened, so it seemed like we had put it all behind us. The day after my 24th birthday, Iraq invaded Kuwait. [male news reporter] Pentagon officials have revealed the scope of the US involvement so far... [female news reporter] More than 160 Air Force Reserve pilots and crew members reported for active duty yesterday at Andrews Air Force Base, and about 1,000 reservists from Virginia, Maryland, and the district were told they are likely to be called up shortly... [male news reporter] ...is on its way to the Mediterranean. Almost 50,000 American servicemen... [female news reporter] Operation Desert Shield has pushed the US military's airlift and sealift capabilities further than ever before. The Saudi armed forces have vacated entire airfields and other military facilities to accommodate the growing... [Mazzoli, voiceover] Seal Teams 1 and 3 were immediately deployed to the Persian Gulf to track the movements of SCUD missile launchers and plant surveillance devices along the Euphrates River. Hammer and his team were gathering intelligence on Hengam Island, small, but of enormous strategic importance at the mouth of the Gulf. -[beep] -[shutter clicks] [shutter clicks] [shutter clicks] [helicopter flies above] [commands in a foreign language] [engines buzzing] [Hammer] We got an enemy boat offshore. Turn inland. Left on my mark. Now! [engines buzzing] Change your heading to southeast. I'll head southwest. Yeah. [gunfire] [metal clang] [gunfire] Hammer! I'm burning in! Keep your heading. Bosco? [gunfire] [panting] [yelling] -[gunshot] -[groans] [groaning] [gun clicks] -[engine buzzing] -Hang tough. I'll be back to get you. [announcement over PA, foreign language] Hell of a place for a reunion, huh? Ask for the best, forget the rest. I did. When do we go get Bosco? I can't get a fucking answer out of anybody. [Admiral] This is Hengam Island. Perfect strategic position at the mouth of the Gulf. Recently, our spy satellites have shown a lot of increase in activity around the island. Until we know what they've got on the island, we can't enter the Gulf. George, we want your team to penetrate the underground compound and find out what they've got. They've got Bosco. We must preserve the element of surprise in case we have to take the island out later, so whatever you do, leave no footprints. How's Barbara? Great. Now that I'm in the Persian Gulf she's in San Diego. I thought you'd never ask. I don't know. I've got BUD/S training, then I've got AOT in Alaska. Now I'm over here on recon. I mean, when the hell do I have the time? It's like Popeye the Sailor. I am what I am. Of course, it didn't help matters that I had this fling with this girl I met in Colorado. She was from Boulder. Barbara found out about it, she took it the wrong way. That'll do it. She asks about you all the time, man. So does Josh. So how have you been? [Admiral] All hands, be advised. Clear all bowl traffic. A little further! Slow! [Admiral] Open interbay locks. -Good luck. -Thanks. -Good luck, Dean. -Sir. [Admiral] Stand by for SDV launch and escort. [officer] Hey, Dean! Hey, Dean! Kick some ass. [male news reporter 1] The aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt steamed through the Suez Canal this afternoon ready to assume her battle station in the Red Sea... [female news reporter] While the Iraqi war machine digs in even deeper, President Bush... [male news reporter 1] ...450 war planes onboard will be operating in water near Iraq... [male news reporter 2] Even though the US Navy is gathering its fleet at the mouth of the Gulf, most of its vessels have not crossed the Straits of Hormuz. Many observers are asking why. [Admiral] On my mark at three, two, one... Mark. SDVs acquisition to target will be 49,000 yards. Ten miles. Green light. [men speaking foreign language] [rumbling] -[beeping] -What's that? The nightly patrol. Sir, they're gonna make it just in time to hit the open net. [man speaking foreign language over PA] [ma over PA continues] [men speaking foreign language] [man speaking foreign language over PA] [men speaking foreign language] Good evening, Mr. Bosco. How do you feel? [men speaking foreign language] [shutter clicks] [man speaking foreign language over PA] [shutter clicks] [interrogator] Listen, I'll count from one to ten. When I reach the first digit of your radio frequency code, just say, "Bingo." I don't ask for much, do I? But remember, I would hate it if my big men were forced to be angry with you again. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... Foolish man. Th desert sands of our great nation will cover your bones. All of you. [brute grunts] -[clicks] -[Mazzoli] Psst. Leave no footprints. We're not leaving him here. [soldier yells] [Bosco groans] [footsteps approach] [man speaking foreign language] [brute punches] [soldier yells] [Bosco cries out] [Bosco cries out] [Bosco laughs] Bingo. [thud] [Bosco panting] Up we go. [man speaking foreign language] [door opens] [Bosco groans] -[gunshot] -[soldier grunts] [Mazzoli] Okay. I got you. [grunts] Okay. Come on. [gun clicks] [alarm blaring] -[man speaking foreign language over PA] -[yelling in foreign language] Fuck! [Bosco] There's another way. We can go through the cooling system right there. [clamoring in foreign language] [alarm blaring] [man continues over PA] [engine propels] -[beep] -I knew it. They got Bosco. But now they're stuck in the net. [clanking] [footsteps above] [men speaking foreign language] [man speaking foreign language] [click] [explosion] [helicopter flies] [alarm blaring] [officer] One, two, three, go! Easy. Hammer! [officer 1] Let's get him fast into decompression. [officer 2] Sustaining heartbeat... [officer 3] You're fine. Let's bring him. Easy does it! [officer 1] Okay, we got paralysis of the legs, noticeable tremors, mild convulsions... Irregular heartbeat. Pulse is up. Air bubbles in the blood. How deep, sir? Thirty feet. [officer 1] All right, let's treat for table seven. [officer 2] Mixture's ready. What's holding us up? [officer 1] All right, let's get him in. Careful. He's sliding. I'm on it. I'm on it. Charge the gas. Dean... If I bite it, take care of Barbara. She likes you better anyway. I think you're a lunatic, and you're gonna live forever. [man] There are signs of pulmonary O2 toxicity. Get that thing on. Let's go. Lock it down. -Garvey. -Sir? You're on the systems check on the fire control turret. [Garvey Aye-aye, sir. You all right? We have to bring her. Bring who? Barbara, his wife. [announcement over PA, foreign language] Can I take your bag, ma'am? Hi, Dean. Hi. So... how bad is he? We don't know yet. He's still in recompression treatment. [doctor] Bring him up to 50 feet, ten feet per minute. I don't see him. Hammer? Hammer? -What? -Hammer? [laughs] Hammer, I'm gonna kill you. How's Josh? [Barbara] He's fine. [doctor] Now, listen. We're gonna bring you up. And if we lose visual contact, just keep talking. Never been a problem. [doctor] Hammer? [singing] Hey! -[singing] I feel good... -[doctor] Is he always like this? -Yeah. Mostly when he's scared. -[Hammer singing indistinctly] [radio report] Tastes like real egg with zero cholesterol and zero fat... You know, you're right, Dean. I am gonna live forever. [Mazzoli] Not if you keep eating 12 eggs at a pop. I can hear your arteries hardening from here. Speaking of hardening... -Hello! -Hello! [news reporter] President Bush will have to decide whether the embargo... -Are you comfortable? -I make a living. [news reporter] ...challenging scores of merchant ships each day. Now they are under orders to stop any suspicious Iraqi tankers. This embargo's bullshit. What about those pictures we got? They're still reading them. It's some very heavy shit. So, we are gonna go back. You can bet on it. -Yeah! -Yeah! Hey, doc! Who do I have to fuck to get out of here, huh? As I just explained to your very beautiful wife, we have to make sure there are no internal injuries we haven't noticed. Doc, there are gonna be a lot of injuries unless you let me out of here. [mouths a word] I'll check on you in the morning, Lieutenant. Good-bye. Hammer, why don't you stop playing around? You could have died. I'm glad to see you want me alive. Two weeks ago, she was ready to kill me. You know I flew halfway around the world with my heart in my mouth. And now that I'm fine, you're pissed off as usual. Hey, I think I'm just gonna head out, okay? Dean, wait for me out there. I need to get to my hotel. You heard the lady. You're still mad at me, aren't you? Diane told me what happened. I was drunk. How unusual. Look, she gave me a ride home. She was all over me. Diane is my best friend. You are my husband. Do we have to fight even now? [foreign language over PA] Can I see you tomorrow? Thank you for the visit, gentlemen. But I do not plan on dying. [Bosco] Not until I see your legs. [laughing] How did they let this guy out of here? I'm just a miracle of modern medicine. You bet. The Admiral has to go, so we'll see you. Thank you. Thanks for coming by, sir. So long, son. [Hammer] Sir... What's the story? Biochemical. Worse than we thought. Photos confirm that we're dealing with B-63 binary gas. What would be the scenario? Stick a gas warhead on a missile, send it up over the Straits. It sits there for about 60 days, contaminates the whole area. Anything comes in contact with it is dead in 20 seconds. Sixty days? That's the genius of it. [clatter] I'm sorry, gentlemen. Injection time. [Admiral] Why you wanna get out of here, I don't know. Hey, Isabel. Do me a favor. Stick it hard in his backside. I will. [Bosco] Hammer... She's gonna take good care of you. [Isabel] Bottoms up. Okay. Hey, am I gonna get a lollipop when I'm done? Only if you behave. Okay. Hey, be gentle. [chatter] Will you make sure that Josh knows it's from me? I will. He's a good kid. Whoa! -[Barbara laughs] -Speaking of good kids. Can we walk somewhere else? There's somewhere I wanna show you. Yeah? Come on. [Mazzoli] It's called the forbidden beach. It's only for foreigners. I wish I could take you for a dive. I wish you would. [rock music plays] I'm cold. Here. Listen, Dean... It's got nothing to do with you. But I'm telling Hammer it's over. Not that he would notice. Wait until he gets home. He can take it. He can take it. I can't. Not anymore. You know? You still have this. You still have this with you? I've been waiting for my dolphin. "Isabel Marx." I don't suppose you have any family in Ohio. No. Listen... Can you get me a medical release form? I need to get out of here tomorrow. I can't. But the doctor said you'd be out of here in eight days. Look, I can't let some doctor wrapped up in this bureaucratic bullshit run my life. Isabel... Get me the form. I won't do it. I can't sit here twiddling my thumbs while somebody else pulls my load. I won't do it. [woman on radio] All American troops -within the sound of my voice... -I'm a Seal. [woman on radio] ...a very good evening. A warm breeze blows, and the scent of jasmine fills the air. Don't you wish you were back with your families? Your wives and mothers cry out to you with longing, "Do you wish to die in a foreign..." I'm sorry. Well... You look well taken care of, dear. We have to talk. So, talk. I'm all ears. Talk. Hammer, please. I came here to tell you... that I've decided... Decided what? That I... Go home. Go back to Josh. I'm gonna be fine. Hammer, I have to talk to you now. It's... It's about Dean. Well, we've talked. You can go. [plane whooshing] Dean... Let's say good-bye now. I can walk you in. No, it's... It's better here. Okay. Mr. Camel. Mr. Camel. Here. Are you going on the mission? What mission? Okay. You take care of yourself. Okay? For both of us. The lieutenant's eyesight is getting worse and worse. You wanted to see me. Is anything wrong? No. Quite the contrary. I feel great. I'm ready to be released. Don't you think I should be the judge of that? [Hammer] Absolutely. That's why I called for you. Would you sign that? What is this? Where did you get this? Will you sign it? I will. In maybe as soon as ten days. I'm sorry. That's not acceptable. Not acceptable? Look, pal, I don't expect you to understand this, but I have got to get out of here today. [doctor] I understand fully. As a matter of fact, I'm going on that mission myself as medical director. We're shipping out tonight. It's a pity you're stuck in the hospital. I'd be happy to dress your wounds. What can I say, doc? Have a good mission. See you in a few days. See you in my next life. [female reporter] These Iranian soldiers were treated for chemical wounds at the university hospital in 1984. [Admiral] The binary components of B-63 have to be combined in a special process. This process can only begin 12 hours after receiving the complementary elements. Okay, that's enough. You get the idea. Any questions? Carry on, George. Thank you, sir. Okay, listen up. The following order involves all operators present and commences at 0400 hours. As a sneak attack on Hengam Island's chemical compound. You will be infiltrating the compound port area via SDVs, where you'll bottom out and dive into the harbor, using rebreathers. The objective... Destroy the facility. The squad under Dean's command will be deployed in four buddy teams. Pair number one, Dean, Albie. [announcement over PA] Middle Eastern Airlines flight 32 to Paris and New York is now ready for boarding. Departing passengers proceed to gate 10 immediately. [George] ...from Lieutenant Hammer, who'll be overseeing the mission along with Bosco and myself, aboard the U.S.S. Hepburn. Last but not least, we've just been informed that as of today, the enemy has been receiving the complementary components to the B-63 binary gas. Due to the urgency of the situation, we've moved up the operation. That means infiltration by daylight. Is there anyone here who's not fully fit to dive? Sir, could I... could I speak to you for a moment, please, privately? Spit it out, Albie. No secrets here. [clears throat] Sir, I went diving today with a beautiful Australian stewardess on the forbidden beach. [George] How deep? Ninety feet, sir. How long? -Forty-five minutes, sir. -[officer] Oops. No good, Albie. You're out. I'm sorry. I fucked up. [Admiral] What's your alternative, George? Hammer. You're the luckiest bastard in the Navy. Blankets, sheets, syringes, and bandages. Yes, we're going to be needing all of these supplies... -Excuse me. -Can you hold on, please? [officers laugh] [inspirational music plays] [Admiral] All hands. All hands. General quarters. General quarters. Stand by battle stations. All hands and special seat detail to your stations. [man] Welcome aboard, Captain. Lieutenant. One hour into it, George. No intervention from Allah. [engine propels] [man speaking foreign language over PA] [ominous music plays] [men speaking foreign language] [Mazzoli] Thurston, Moonjean, set security up at that dock. Keep the gunboat light in case we got to get out of here fast. Redhead, T.J., in three. Carter, Greenspan, two feet behind Hammer and me. The doc didn't clear you, did he? No. You irresponsible son of a bitch! Nobody is perfect. You're risking our lives in this mission. Save it. [boat horn] Let's move out.
