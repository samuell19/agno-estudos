Takumi! Takumi? Takumi, open your eyes! Takumi! Takumi, are you alright?! Dad... what is this...? You have to listen to me! That light is going to turn people evil! And one day, an extraterrestrial entity may try and use its power to destroy the Earth! When that happens, the key to Earth's survival will be... Where are Banjou and the others? Here's your weather report. So hot! The calender has nothing but clear days for the near future... Banjou's visiting his girlfriend's grave. And Grease is off to the Trio's grave. But at night, expect sudden strong showers. Well, it is the Bon holiday season... Of all the timing... What about Gen, is he visiting his father's grave? Nope. Be on the look out for sudden weather changes... He says he cannot function without 8 hours of sleep, or else he'll die. Dad... What the hell?! I guess I'm the only Kamen Rider, then. The speeches from the new governors are expected to begin soon. The speeches from the new governors is about to start... The speeches will be broadcast simultaneously Coming. from their respective locations in Touto, Seito and Hokuto. Alright! Time to enjoy these noodles before they get soggy. Seriously, these people... We're here at the venue for the speech in Touto. The new governor of Touto is about to begin his inaugural speech. As you can see, quite a crowd has gathered, and excitement is high. It's not an exaggeration to say that the entire nation's focus is on these three new governors. Oh, he's just come into view! The question is now, what does the new governor have to say? And what kind of future will he propose to us? Our country has been split into three city states for years, with it turning into a gruesome conflict. But all that is about to change. With the Pandora Tower as its new base, Touto... And I, Inou Kengo... Here in Seito, I, Gobara Mitsuomi... As your Hokuto representative, I, Saiga Ryoka will proceed to carry out my duties as governor. The three cities will work as one to support the government. Our nation is on the verge of a grand rebirth! Arata! I'll distract them, you run that way! What about you?! Just do what I say! It's okay now. Who are you, mister? Listen carefully, kid. I'm not that old. No misters necessary. Arata! You need to run. Well... let's begin the experiment. RABBIT! TANK! BEST MATCH! ARE YOU READY? Transform! THE FULLMETAL MOONSAULT! RABBITTANK! YEAH! Now, then... With our national goal set, I would like to propose a question to my fellow citizens. Does our nation need Kamen Riders? The Kamen Riders are weapons of war! And you have all lost so much to war already! The Kamen Riders are the embodiment of the pain we've suffered! In particular, Kamen Rider Build... Despite once being declared guilty of treason, he continues to run amuck in our country! He is a public menace! Can we really afford... To let Build run free?! Another rampage from him could mean the return of our collective nightmare! The time has come for us to deliver just punishment onto Kamen Rider Build! We will destroy Build! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Let the operation to destroy Build... Begin. Huh? What's going on? Huh? What? What is... er? Wha? What?! Huh?! What? What's the commotion? What is this?! What?! Why?! Goodbye... Build. Kamen Rider Build The Movie: Be The One You gotta be kidding me! Did we really have to do this in the middle of summer?! Whoa, holyâ€”that's live ammo! What the fudge?! Oh, come on! Go! Operation Destroy Build, huh? And you didn't think to fill me in? We have stayed at your side, Evolt, operating from the shadows. I wonder who'll win? By manipulating the three nations from the shadows, we triggered the war. We will strike with righteous might to victory! Prime Minister Himuro has fallen sick... This is your chance to launch a war. All that's happened so far is because we Blood have invaded this planet. Well yeah, that's why I set you up as governors as a thank you gift... Naw! That ain't right. We're here to destroy this planet, right? Like what happened with Mars... using all the energy that Pandora's Box has. We've been devouring planets throughout the universe. That's our duty, as part of the Blood race. And yet... You betrayed us. The energy of Pandora's Box... Is mine, you realize? We've made arrangements to compensate. Destroying Build is the groundwork. How far are you guys gonna chase me?! Where do you get off having all this fun without us? The governor announced that Build must be destroyed. Everyone is going to be out for your blood! CROCODILE! ROBOT JELLY! Transform. CRUSHED! OOZING! OVERFLOWING! ROBOT IN GREASE! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! We can't fight civillians, but we're not gonna let them tear you apart either! I suppose the brainwashing wouldn't work on Kamen Riders. You...! It's been a while, Mr. Himuro. Are you behind this?! What's the point of it?! Because destroying Build is the mission of the new administration. Are you for real...? Go! You need to find out what the hell is going on! Got it! Hey! Quit grabbingâ€”hey! Get off me! How far can you run, my dear little Build? The Kamen Riders are the embodiment of the pain we've suffered! In particular, Kamen Rider Build... Where have I seen him before...? Oh, little angels! Come here! Come on. I won't bite. Okay, fine, I'll go to you. There we go! Say cheese! And here we go... ...damn, I'm dumb. Misora... Sawa... Things... are insane right now... This is terrible. You're joking, right? I give, I give! What is going on here? Banjou?! Hey, what the hell is going on?! I'd like to know myself. Misora and Sawa were acting crazy, too... For real? Hang on, I'll be there in aâ€” That ain't happening. Owowow... Who the hell are you?! Been ten years since I landed on this planet... And I've been keeping an eye on you. To think we actually need your help this time... But you're not the kinda guy who'd help us without a fight, huh? Okay. Don't tell me... Yep. Turning your girlfriend into a Smash? That was my idea! CROSS-Z MAGMA! ARE YOU READY? Transform! THE RED-HOT MUSCLES! CROSS-Z MAGMA! HOTHOTHOTHOT! What is Banjou doing...? You did that to Kasumi...! You're pretty tough! Who are you? You will be the switch that triggers the end of the world. You'll have to wait here nice and quiet, until our ceremony is over. I didn't see! I swear I didn't see your underwear! No one cares! Thank goodness... my login still works. DATA SEARCH: Kiwami Project I knew it. They're the crew of the Mars expedition from ten years ago... I've been waiting for you, Kiryuu Sento. Inou... It seems introductions won't be necessary. What are you, really? Are you connected to Evolt? You're every bit as quick as I'd expect a brilliant physicist to be. I am not human. I'm the same race as Evolt. A survivor of the Blood. The Blood...? For the past ten years, we've been manipulating things behind the scenes. You were able to locate Banjou after his escape with the help of that internet idol, yes? Faster than even the government... Did that never strike you as odd? Then it was... Yes. We were the ones who pushed you and Banjou together. I know everything about you. Erasing the memories of the Devil's Scientist, Katsuragi Takumi, and creating the sham hero, Kiryuu Sento... That was my idea. All for the sake of destroying the Earth. But Evolt had a change in plans. Which is why... We've decided to undertake matters without him. Banjou! Do it. Stop, Banjou! Nothing you say will reach him. He's nothing more than a marionette, now. HAWK! GATLING! BEST MATCH! Destroy Build... Destroy... Why is this happening?! Destroy... Build... Destroy... Destroy... Destroy... The entire nation is your enemy. There's no way you can escape. And I suppose it's time we begin the final steps of Operation Destroy Build. Inou! RABBIT & RABBIT! Return them to normal! You've assumed incorrectly. Eliminating the Kamen Riders... That is what they truly want. What?! The public despises Kamen Riders, and see them as the military tools that brought terror into their lives... The sight of you all remind them of war, and aggravates their trauma. This country doesn't need Kamen Riders. Destroy... Destroy... Banjou...! Destroy... Destroy... Destroy... Misora! Sawa! Destroy... Destroy... I'm begging you... You have to snap out of it! That's enough loafing around, on your feet! Cross-Z. Finish it. Don't do this... READY GO! Banjou! It's finally mine... The power of destruction! Well? How do you feel? Betrayed by the people. Betrayed by your friends. Even your partner. You are powerless! You have nothing left. No... You never had anything to begin with. The person known as Kiryuu Sento has always been hollow. Your role in this is over. MAX HAZARD ON! GREAT CROSS-Z DRAGON! Transform... ARE YOU READY? Kiryuu Sento. Allow me to mark the period ending your life. Evolt... what do you think this accomplishes? You were after the Hazard Trigger all along, huh? Yes. And now we can begin the ceremony. Earth's destruction is nearly at hand. Takumi! Takumi? You have to listen to me! That light is going to turn people evil! And one day, an extraterrestrial entity may try and use its power to destroy the Earth! When that happens, the key to Earth's survival will be... It'll be Banjou Ryuuga! Banjou...? He's a young boy involved with my research! One day, you will run into him! His power can change the world! Why are you telling me this...? Take care of my son, please! Right! It's okay, let's get you someplace safe! Dad! Dad, why did you become a scientist? Yo. Finally awake, huh? What is this? Inou's planning to use the Hazard Trigger. That was the reason he used the public to go after you... To push you to the brink, psychologically, and charge the Trigger with more energy. Now he just needs Pandora's Box... And Earth is kaput. Gotta say, you really got your ass kicked, huh? Fell right into their little plan... Such a disappointment. I guess in the end you were just a fake hero spouting a bunch of hollow idealistic crap about justice. Your old man must be spinning in his grave. What the hell do you know?! More than you, kid. Since we're the ones who built you, Kiryuu Sento. Where am I...? Who... am I...? Consider yourself lucky. If you want me to release Banjou, you'll bring Pandora's Box to a location of my choosing! You don't actually intend on taking it to him, do you? Everything about me was just... a fabrication... You knew as much. You were letting your high-minded ideals distract you from the truth. Your missing memories... They were of how we created the Rider System. The System I built to defeat Evolt! I knew full well it'd be militarized... But I did it to fulfill Dad's wishes! But in the end... We were just being used. Inou's right. If I had never built this thing, there never would've been a war. I put my faith in science... And then in Dad... And this is the result. You're right. If we hadn't built the Rider System, maybe there'd have been no war. But... Without it... the Earth... And all the irreplaceable people I've met... they would've all been lost. I remember now. Banjou is the key to Earth's survival... You still don't understand?! Banjou's existence only brings destruction! You're the one who doesn't understand. He's... A simpleton, with muscles for brains, who's easily deceived... But... He'll never hesitate to fight for someone else's future. He is my partner, and I need him. Our friendship... That was not a fabrication. If Dad really designed Build to defeat Evolt... That means Banjou figures into his equations. I need to find out how. Even if that's the case, you'll never reach the data unless you know what to look for! Grow! Like a plant! This is as far as it goes! Come on, Beardo, stretch! Quit calling me Beardo! Just keep stretching, dammit! Dammit Beardo! You're tall, act like it! Quiet, you stupid potato farmer. Dammit, dude, if we had our belts... You mean these? Utsumi... What the hell are you doing here? Do you want them or not? We want them! Then I expect you to ask for them while showing proper deference. What, you want us to beg? Who the hell'd be that pathetic... Beardo?! Please! Release Banjou. Banjou is a key element for our ceremony. Why don't we settle this matter with a battle? MAX HAZARD ON! GREAT CROSS-Z DRAGON! Transform. CLASH! CLANG! CLASH! CLANG! ARE YOU READY? OVERFLOW! WAKE UP CROSS-Z! GET GREAT DRAGON! OH, NO! GREAT! ALL YEAH! GENIUS! YEAH! YEAH! ARE YOU READY? Transform. BUILD GENIUS! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Oh, how it must pain you. Here you are, putting your life on the line. Yet they still mock and ridicule you like this! Destroy... Destroy... Destroy... Destroy... Destroy... Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy... Des... troy... Des... This battle is over. Save your resentment for them... For their selfish, misguided hatred towards you. And for yourself, the pitiful tool that you are. Shut up. Shut the hell up! Even if people deny my very existence... Even if they hate me... I'm still going to fight! Banjou... I'm taking your life. RABBIT! Banjou! A well executed attack. But... Far too late! If Evolt's power would reach to the heavens, then we will approach the depths of Earth, and tear it apart from its core! Banjou! Sento? What the...? My dear Build! Let's play. This works out perfect, I was hoping to raise some more hell. You don't mind if we join in then, right? You guys... ROBOT JELLY! CROCODILE! Transform! CRUSHED! OOZING! OVERFLOWING! ROBOT IN GREASE! I'll let my passion burn and crush you! You're going to be sacrifices for the greater good. Hey, what are you doing? That's a rabbit and a dragon. There's no way that kinda combo works. I wouldn't be so sure. "The bottle of a Hazard Level 7 Rider undergoes a certain type of evolution." "If it comes into contact with a similar second bottle, it shall initiate an 'ultimate' chemical reaction." Which means that two Kamen Riders will be necessary. But for anyone to reach Hazard Level 7 other than Build... It would have to be Banjou, who has Evolt's DNA. I think Dad knew that. That's why he designed the Build Driver to be equipped with two bottles. I know this will work. Because it's our bottles. Sento! You two will bring hope. The bottles... Misora! Now... let's begin the final experiment. CROSS-Z BUILD! Huh? What the...?! I'm kinda trapped, dude! The hell's going on?! ARE YOU READY?! No, I'm not! Transform! Whaâ€” RABBIT! DRAGON! BE THE ONE! CROSS-Z BUILD! YEAH! YEAH! So does this... Did we just...? We combined?! What the hell, Sento?! Explain! Hold on. This entirely defies the laws of physics as we know them... Whatever, I don't get it but we really need to go! Dammit, fine then! Hold it right there! One last pitiful gasp, eh? We've got the winningâ€” I feel likeâ€” We might lose! Hey... Quit interrupting my moves! You need to sync up! No, you! The weaker the dog, the louder its bark! Shut the hell up! Where are Sento and the others? They're fighting. For everyone's sake. Here it comes! Bring it on! Suck on this! What the hell are you looking at? You shiny golden turd! Ferocity! Vigor! TWIN! Fury! TWIN! What's gotten into you?! TWIN BREAK! TWIN FINISH! Step to me and get stepped on! No wayâ€” Got him, Miitan... Miitan? Hey, Miitan! ...where even is this? Is that it?! I don't like weak men! That's a little... better! But this is it! Impossible... We're supposed to be stronger... We will defend this country. CRACK UP FINISH! You forced my hand. I told you already! The humans hate Kamen Riders, the embodiments of war! Even if the brainwashing is gone, they will never appreciate you, or praise your efforts! That is not what we were fighting for! Then why go to such lengths to defend these foolish humans?! Why do you two fight?! That's pretty obvious... Take care of my son, please! Dad! Dad, why did you become a scientist? For love and peace! Your dad became a scientist for the sake of love and peace! We're fighting for the sake of love and peace! We're going to build a future for everyone! And no one can destroy that feeling! What is this power?! How can a mere human push me like this?! I get the feeling we can't lose! We've got the winning formula! ARE YOU READY? Love and Peace Finish! Inou... You guys were screwed the moment you betrayed me. The bottles went back to normal... I guess that means it was some kinda miracle form. Good. I never want to transform with you like that again, anyways. Yeah, well right back at you! Get your own thoughts, stupid. Don't call me stupid. Say stupid as fast as you can. StupidstupidstupidstupidstupidSTUPID! How many was that? Three times. You're way off, stupid. Stop it! Or at least add muscle-brains. Why do I gotta say that? And what's with you and muscâ€” That's why you're the stupid one, worming out of that with logic! I don't get it. Prime Minister Midou will be selecting a new trio of governors, making an appeal for a new administration. PM Midou Masakuni PM Midou Masakuni Public Outcry Against Kamen Riders On The Rise Protests Held At Pandora's Tower Protests Held At Pandora's Tower Public Outcry Against Kamen Riders On The Rise However, public outcry for the removal of Kamen Riders has grown louder, with a multitude gathered outside the Pandora Tower in protest. It's really sad... After you all fought so hard for everyone's sake. Hey, mister! Thanks for saving everybody! Seriously, drop the mister. I'm not that old. I wonder why it is It's fine. That everyone's sights are so different As long as someone is able to build a future... That's enough. And why that makes it so easy To hurt someone with careless words All I can do right now Might amount to nothing but a whisper But if you give up on trying You'll lose your reason for meeting You'll even lose sight of your reason for dreaming This everlasting sky spreads out endlessly With nothing else to block the view What I want to protect is under this everlasting sky A future where your tears will dry When the night falls on our sky And the light fades out Don't you worry, we can fly I want to keep looking for it Just find a brand new day Shining so bright into the distance... This everlasting sky spreads out endlessly With nothing else to block the view This everlasting sky will someday be A dazzling, blinding sight Under which we'll meet and share our dreams I hope to show you a future without pain That's the world I want you to see And someday, I will Where am I? Ex-Aid?! TIME MAZINE! Kamen...? Rider...? I've got your power right here! Armor Time. BUILD! KAMEN RIDER ZI-O! ARMOR TIME! Yeah! BEST MATCH! BUILD! FINISH TIME! Here it comes! BUILD! VORTEX TIME BREAK! Who are you? How do you have my power? I'm Kamen Rider Zi-O. The overlord with the powers of all Kamen Riders, or so I'm told.
