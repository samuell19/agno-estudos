[police siren wailing] [cheerful orchestral music] [car honks] [cars honking] [cars honking] [radio announcer] ...on a breezy spring day. Good morning, Oscar. Did you sleep well, Oscar? -[doorbell rings] -Oh... Well, it wasn'’t okay with me. -Terrible night. -[doorbell rings] Good morning, Mr. Argo. How are you this morning? -Come for the rent. -Of course you did. I know you didn'’t come for cultural exchange. Got it or not? I have it, Mr. Argo. I went right down to the Social Security office after you left yesterday. It took me all afternoon but they finally came through with the payment. Next month, I want it on time. No excuses. They said they would try, Mr. Argo. Oh, I don'’t care about "they". That'’s your problem. I don'’t need the aggravation. Three days late this month, a week last month. When Mr. Kaplan owned the building they would sometimes be three weeks late, and he never complained. Kaplan was a schmuck. Mr. Kaplan was a lovely man, Mr. Argo. That'’s why he went bankrupt. Listen, if you'’re not happy here... I'’m not sure that I'd be happy anywhere these days, Mr. Argo. But I did find this room bearable these past eight years before you became landlord. If you wanna leave, just let me know. I can rent this place tomorrow for what you pay. I have a lease, Mr. Argo. And I intend to stay. Okay, but the animal'’s got to go. -What animal? -That parrot. [parakeet chirping] It'’s a parakeet. And it'’s a bird, not an animal. It'’s a pet, ain't it? -Yes. -Then it'’s got to go. No animals, no pets. That'’s in your lease. If Oscar goes, I go. Fine, Mrs. Quigley. You have 30 days to find a new apartment. [parakeet chirps] Shut up, Oscar! Oh, dear... not that much. Terrible man. What a happier place this world would be without horrible people like that Mr. Argo. Get the hell off my car. [silencer gunshot] Oh... Oh! Oh, my goodness! Oh, no! [rock music] [gasps] [music ends] [woman sings in German] [pop rock music] Damn it! [music continues] Oh! [parakeet chirping] Wish me luck, Oscar. [parakeet chirps] [ringing] Yeah? My name is Grace Quigley. You see the sign? It says no soliciting. It'’s against the law. So is murder. I'’m quite alone, Mr. Flint. Um... Couldn'’t you... open a window... or something? I wasn'’t expecting company. Or spray yourself. Here, lady. Here's your fresh air. [Grace] Thank you. Are you a professional or an amateur? Professional or amateur what? A professional or amateur murderer? Let'’s not waste time, Mr. Flint. I saw you commit the act. -Act? -The act of eradicating that poor, horrible man. I was sitting in front of my building Waiting to go apartment hunting thanks to him. Thanks to you, I won'’t have to, but I witnessed the whole thing. -Yeah? -I'’m not here to turn you in, Mr. Flint, even though I don'’t appreciate criminal types. I'’m here... -because I need your services. -Yeah? I want someone killed, Mr. Flint. And I think you'’re the man to do it. -Why me? -[Grace] Because you are the only murderer I know, and you certainly did a competent job on Mr. Argo. Yeah. [Grace] How much do you charge to give someone the rub or whatever it'’s called in your profession? Well, ma'am... I think if someone was in the profession that you say I'’m in, they'’d probably charge five to twenty thousand a hit, depending on the circumstances. That much? How much would you expect to pay if you found a professional? Well, wait just a minute. There'’s 218 dollars and 15, 16, 17 cents. Don'’t treat a professional like an amateur. You might hurt their feelings. It'’s every cent I have in the world, Mr. Flint. Ma'am, for 218 dollars and 17 cents, you can'’t get a professional even to break a man'’s finger, let alone make a hit. I'’m not trying to blackmail you, Mr. Flint. Blackmail is against the law. But couldn'’t you give me... a special price for being so considerate about the police? I appreciate that. But a hit is never easy and it'’s always dangerous. 2,000 is the lowest I can go. Supposing the victim cooperates? Cooperates? -I don'’t get it. -[Grace] It'’s very simple. I'’ll try to raise the money if you'’ll agree to do it for 1,000, and I'’ll cooperate in every way I can. You see... I'’m the victim. [Dr. Herman] Crazy, crazy, crazy! [Flint] That'’s what I thought. But she'’s not crazy. She'’s just a little old lady that'’s tired of the rat race. Hell, when she told me her problems, I don'’t blame her for wanting to go. Only I didn'’t want to be the one that sends her. -So what did you do? -Well... I told her to raise 1,000, I'’d see if I could help her out. Help her out? Help her out? Or do her in? Come on, doc. I don t wanna hurt her. She'’s got class. Seymour, one week you tell me, "I don'’t want to hurt anybody, doc!" The next week you come in here and you tell me who you killed. That'’s nuts, craziness. You see how mixed up you are? Yeah, I know how mixed up I am. That'’s why I pay you 75 dollars an hour, to unmix me. Wait a minute. Sit down. Let'’s set the record straight. You came to me because you had psychosomatically-caused heartburn and nosebleeds, and what else? What else, huh? Huh? Shooting pains in your right arm. Let'’s not forget the right arm, pal. The arm which you needed to practice your profession. How long did it take us before those shooting pains were gone? -I don'’t remember. -Three weeks of intensive analysis and those pains were gone and you went back to work. Remember that? Yeah. I remember I never had a headache in my life since then, headaches. Like shooting pains, only in the head. Shhh, shhh, all right, all right. There'’s a little tension here. A little tension here. It'’s okay. Take a deep breath. -Come on, take a deep breath. -[inhales deeply] Exhale. Let the head go. Let it roll. Let it roll back. Shake the arms out. [both murmuring] Good, good. Now, Seymour, sit down. If you remember at the time we agreed that your arm was more important than your head because you needed your arm to practice your profession. Of course, at the time, you didn'’t tell me what you did for a living and that was very naughty of you. Anyway, three weeks of intensive analysis, I cured the arm. Now, some things take a little more time than others. If you want the heartburn and the nosebleeds and the headaches to stop, then you just have to accept what you are. A killer. [doorbell rings] Mr. Flint, I'’ve got it! [Flint] I can'’t talk to you now. But, Mr. Flint, [stutters] we must talk. [Flint] Call me tomorrow! [telephone rings] -Hello? -[Grace] Mr. Flint? Mrs. Quigley, I told you yesterday I was in bed with the flu. Call me in a few days. Uh, hello, Helen. It'’s Flint. I need some treatment. Will you send someone right away? Yeah, again. Why? You complaining? Yeah, all right. Make it as soon as you can, will you? No, for Christ'’s sake, not Mary. What about that little girl, you know, what'’s her name? Ah... Yeah, that'’s it. Muriel. Yeah, thanks, Helen. Tell her to make it as soon as she can. Bye. [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings repeatedly] Oh, no. Oh, dear. You do look terrible. Now, listen. I told you... [Grace] Yes, I know. And you look it. -You should be in bed. -[pots clanging] That'’s where I was going. -[Grace] Then go, go, go. -Oh... Hmm-mmm... Look, ma'am, I don'’t need the chicken soup bit. This is not chicken soup. It'’s my own recipe, guaranteed to put you back on your feet by morning. Well, I'’m on my feet now, and I'’d really appreciate it if you'’d just leave. I have every intention of leaving as soon as you get back into bed and finish this. As your future employer, I have a right to be concerned about your health. Sit down, Mr. Flint. Sit down. You have to take care of yourself so that you can take care of me. Now, drink up. Young man, do you realize what an important profession you'’re in? It'’s just a job. No, drink it all. Well, you'’re modest, that'’s understandable. I'’m sure a great many people would consider you a despicable character. I know I would in... in the past. Now I feel privileged to know you. -Yeah? -Yes. Truly. Yes. It'’s almost as if I had a new lease on life now that I can look forward to my death by a professional killer. You see, I tried it twice on my own. The first time about a year after George died. The doctors discovered a problem with my heart, ordered complete bed rest. I started running up and down stairs, doing exercises, overdoing everything, just got healthier than ever. No heart problems since. The second time, about, um... three years ago. Pills. They found me, pumped out my stomach. I never want to go through that again. In fact, after that experience I knew that I would never have the courage to try to kill myself again. And then you came into my life. What can I say but thank you? I ain'’t done nothing yet. Oh, Mr. Flint. You'’ve already given me a priceless gift. The dignity of making my own choice as to whether I want to live or die. Ma'am, most people think I'’m some kind of an animal. Then you'’ve dealt with the wrong kind of people. It'’s all point of view, isn'’t it? To most people, the act your perform is going to be called murder. To me, it'’s an act of mercy. And if I were a more orthodox person, I'’d say, "Bless you." Now, you lie down. I'’ll leave my address on your hall table. I want you to be at my house at noon tomorrow. And the 1,000 dollars we agreed on will be paid to you in full. Go to sleep now. You'’ll be all better in the morning. -[Flint] Mrs. Quigley. -Yes? You'’re a nice lady. But once I take your money, I'’m committed. Think about that. There'’s nothing to think about, Mr. Flint. I'’ve never felt more certain of anything in my life. [Muriel mumbles] I beg your pardon. Oh, hello. I'’m Muriel. Is Seymour Flint in? He'’s sick. He can't see anyone. Oh, really? That'’s right. He'’s in bed. Shall we go? Are you Seymour'’s girlfriend? Kind of. Sometimes. Are you Seymour'’s mother? He'’s the only son I have at the moment. Oh, yeah, I understand. [Grace] Tell me, Muriel, what do you do for a living? -I turn tricks. -Marvelous! I used to do tricks myself when I was younger. -Really? -[laughs] Oh, sure. I bet I could have taught you a few. Now of course, I'’m too old. I don'’t have my contacts in, but you don'’t look that old. Then you must be legally blind. But very sweet. Would you like to come to a party tomorrow night? What kind of a party? A surprise party for Seymour. It sounds weird. Okay, maybe I'’ll come. -"Maybe I'’ll come." -[both laugh] [tires screech] [doorbell rings] You'’re late. You'’re lucky I showed up at all. I spent the sickest night of my life thanks to your health brew. Yes, it does have a cleansing effect. Come on in. Let me take your hat. [Flint] I see you'’re busy. I'’ll come back another time. [Grace] It'’s all right. We can talk in front of Mr. Jenkins. -No, we can'’t. -But we have to. He'’s part of the deal. He'’s part of the deal? Yes. I told Mr. Jenkins all about you. But of course, he wanted to see you for himself, be sure of all the details before he commits. Could you explain your line of work to Mr. Jenkins, just for the record? I got nothing to say. Now, I'’m just here to listen. Do you understand? Harvey, why don'’t you tell Mr. Flint what you have in mind? Well... I... I... I can'’t stand pain so it has to be painless and I'’d like to look like I went out natural '’cause I've got some relatives in Iowa that might be upset if they thought I'’d met with a violent end. Yeah. Also... I'’d appreciate it if you could do it after next Tuesday but before next Friday. Uh... Tuesday I get my pension check and on Friday I have to pay my rent. I'’d hate to pay for an extra month, and I'’d like to send the money to a friend who needs it. Is that asking too much? Don'’t worry, Harvey. He'’ll do it. And I'’ll see to it that he does it exactly as ordered. Thank you both. You'’re quite welcome, Harvey. [Flint] Look, what are you trying to do to me? Why don'’t you just turn me over to the cops? [Grace] I wouldn'’t do that, Mr. Flint. I need you. [Flint] Listen, if you go around telling everybody what kind of job I do, I ain'’t gonna be no use to nobody, except the state. Why are you bringing the old man in this? Because I knew that Mr. Jenkins would be happy to pay 2,000 dollars for his own painless demise, and that would cover the cost for both of us. It was the only way I could get the money. And... here it is! The first payment. One thousand dollars. That'’s for Mr. Jenkins. I'’ll give you the second thousand for myself after I make sure that Mr. Jenkins is relieved of his burdens according to his specifications. I don'’t like it. What... The money? It'’s real, -you can see for yourself. -I don'’t like the whole deal. I don'’t like the whole setup. -But you agreed... -No, I didn'’t agree to kill the old man. Maybe I don'’t want to. Why? Didn'’t you like him? Maybe that'’s the point. He'’s a nice old man. It doesn'’t make my job any easier to sit down and have a friendly chat with people I gotta do a job on, do you understand? Why should Mr. Jenkins have to suffer just because he'’s nice? Now look, my job is tough enough -without getting emotionally-- -Exactly! Don'’t think of it as a job. Think of it as a favor to a nice old man. A good deed that you'’re getting paid for. Seymour... take the money. Fine. Now, I want you to come to dinner this evening. I'’m busy. [Grace] Please. Please, come. It'’s important. Afterwards we can sit down with Mr. Jenkins and discuss the best way to do the job. Now look, I told you, I really don'’t like sitting down and having little chats with people I got a contract on, you understand? Have our little chats been so terrible? Please come. Okay, what the hell? Wonderful! Also, I see you ride a motorcycle. I wish you wouldn'’t, -they'’re too dangerous. -Yeah. You have to take care of yourself, Mr. Flint. -Yeah. -There are people -depending on you. -Yeah. [parakeet chirping] [chuckles] It certainly is, Oscar. I can'’t remember when I'’ve been this excited or felt so... alive! [chuckling] [Flint] Hey, hey! Hey Luis, the flowers any good for dinner with a little old lady? [Luis] My man, so good you could eat them. -How much? -For you, two dollars. I thought flowers were only good for funerals. [soft classical music] [muffled chatter] [doorbell rings] How good of you to be on time. Over here. We'’re going to have dinner in Mr. Jenkins'’ apartment. Oh, look, flowers. How sweet of you. Come on. The guest of honor! The guest of honor. Thank you for accepting the job of sending us home. -Now, you must... -I'’m very anxious to meet you. -I'’m Emily Watkins. -[Grace] Yes, Emily. Thank you very much. I'’d like you to come over here and say hello. I want you to meet a few of our friends, -Sam Pincus. -Happy to be included. -[Grace] And Homer... -This is an unexpected blessing. I'’m Homer Morrison. And here are our two ladies. Sara Hodgkins. Sara'’s deaf. So is her cat. -[cat meows] -And Dorothy Trugert. I'’m just blind in one eye, Mr. Flint. Fine. [Emily] Uh, Mr. Flint? Uh, uh, let'’s just say we'’re all charter members of the same club. [Grace] Yes, that'’s one way of putting it. Ready and willing members, Mr. Flint. Fine. [Jenkins] All right, everyone. He'’s the man. ♪ For he'’s a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he'’s a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he'’s a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ What the hell is all this? It'’s Mr. Jenkins' going away party. If it'’s his going away party, why am I the guest of honor? Who the hell are these people? What have you told them about me? Simply that Mr. Jenkins is going home this weekend and you'’re the man responsible for sending him there. [doorbell rings] I'’ll go. Stop worrying. Muriel! Come in, come in. I miss anything yet? [Muriel] Nice turnout. Where'’s Seymour? [Grace] Oh, in here somewhere having a good time. -[gasps] -Thanks for opening the window, Mr. Flint. -Yeah. -Er... Would you like meeting a few more of my friends? Look, pop. I'’d appreciate it if you didn'’t throw my name around here, all right? I'’m sorry. But it's okay. I haven'’t told anybody. [Grace] Mr. Flint? Mr. Flint? -Ah! -Hey, Seymour! Harvey, I want you to meet Mr. Flint'’s girlfriend, -Muriel. -Hi. Are you Seymour'’s daddy? [laughs] No, no. This is Mr. Jenkins, -our host. -Oh. Well, hi, anyway. [Grace] It'’s all right, Harvey. Mr. Flint doesn'’t mind if you shake her hand. Glad you could join us, Miss Muriel. You'’re... Do you mind if I say she'’s very pretty? Do you mind if we leave? Let'’s go. -But I just got here. -It'’s the best time to go. I'’m sorry if I offended you, Mr. Flint. I didn'’t mean anything bad when I said she was pretty. No, it'’s all right, pop. We just have to go, that's all. Mr. Flint, you have a contractual obligation to stay here. I was just gonna break out the champagne. No kidding! Imported or domestic? Napa Sonoma Mendocino. Sounds fantastic! Seymour, how can you just walk out and not try that? I don'’t drink. You coming with me? She can'’t. She'’s promised to stay and show us how she does tricks. I sure would like to try some of that Napa Sonoma whatever. Can'’t you wait, Seymour? [Jenkins] I'’ll get her the champagne. No, no. Let me. Why don'’t you take Seymour to the bathroom instead? -That'’s a fun idea. Can I come? -[Flint snaps his fingers] They have to talk. Come on. Okay. Look, I work alone. So it'’ll be done exactly like you wanted it done. I just wanted to make it easier. I appreciate that, but if you make it too easy, I might get careless. You wouldn'’t want that, would you? Oh no. You do it your way then. I have every confidence in you. [grunts] Yeah, well. Now look, pop... I'’ve never done this before, but how would you feel if I said you could still change your mind? Maybe I'’d even give you your money back. Oh, I'’d feel terrible. After this party, I could never face my friends again if I were alive. Why would a man like you, with all these friends, wanna get himself killed? Truth is... all my life I'’ve... really always been very shy around people. I guess I... tried to make up for that by making as many friends as I could. You know, doing nice little things for them. I'’m not too strong anymore and I just about run out of money. Pretty soon I won'’t be able to do much of anything for anyone. I had thought maybe my family would care but all they wanted to do was send me to a little furnished room where I could die in front of a TV set. That'’s too slow, Mr. Flint. Too painful and too lonely. So... Thanks again for helping me out. It'’s your funeral. [guests laugh and chatter] [laughter] Muriel is going to do her tricks. Quiet, everyone. Silence please. Muriel is ready to begin. I'’ll cue you for the music, okay? Now all I need is two strong men. You... and you. Me? Music, please. Just around the table. ["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" by Tchaikovsky] -[Muriel hums] -[guests gasps] Disgusting. Hello. [Muriel chuckles] [laughing] [Muriel] Your hand. [laughing] [Muriel moans] -Oh! -[guests gasp] [Muriel hums] [Muriel sighs] ["Russian Dance" by Tchaikovsky] [men gasp] [laughing] [Muriel] Oh! -[Muriel] Whee! -Yeah! Come on, Seymour! Whoo! Whoo! [Muriel laughs] Whee! Whee! Whoo! [Muriel shouts] -[guests clap] -[Muriel] Thank you. Take my advice, Seymour. Marry her. You'’ll have a lot of fun. I don'’t know what to tell you, Harvey, except to be patient. Thank you, Harvey. That'’s very good. But Grace, it'’s Thursday, and Mr. Flint didn'’t call or come over on Tuesday like he said he would. Harvey, stop worrying. You sit down here. I have every confidence that Mr. Flint is going to come through with something wonderful for you. And you won'’t be with us tomorrow. Stop worrying. [telephone rings] Hello? I'’m sorry, you have the wrong number. [doorbell rings] [suspenseful music] Coming, Mr. Flint. [doorbell rings] Now remember, nothing painful. [doorbell rings] [Muriel] Hi. Flint sent me. [Muriel laughs] Oh my. Drive. Please drive! What the hell's the matter? Did you give him the money? I never had a chance to. He took one look at me and keeled over dead. Well, are you sure? We'’ll call an ambulance. I'’m sure, I'm sure! His eyes were open and he had a funny smile on his face. Come on, Seymour! Let'’s get out of here. [tires screech] [telephone rings] -Yes? -Listen, call an ambulance and check on Jenkins. I think he might be dead. Bless you, Seymour. Bless you. Bless me? [Grace] Doesn'’t he look wonderful? Look at that smile. It'’s his own. They didn'’t put that on him. He obviously went with no pain at all. There are absolutely no signs of violence. He does look happy, doesn'’t he? Yes. I can hardly wait. Well, yes. I think I know what you mean. No more worries. That'’s right, Emily. No more worries. I hope. [Flint] Jenkins died of a heart attack. How clever of you. Look, ma'am, why don'’t you just take your thousand dollars back, go on a little vacation and reconsider your plans for dying? Oh! I don'’t want to die now, Seymour. And I certainly don'’t want to take a vacation. Thanks to you. -Me? -Yes, you. Now I have a reason for living. Helping others to find the peace and happiness that you so beautifully brought to Mr. Jenkins. -Yeah. -Now if you'’d agree to a special group rate, we could really make a killing. I already have five people lined up. Five people? Some of the guests at the party. I took them to see Harvey'’s body and they were very impressed with your work, Mr. Flint. I think your nose is bleeding. You mean, you told them that I killed Mr. Jenkins? I told them that you could give them the same relief from their misery -that you gave to-- -No, I can'’t! Muriel and I are getting married. I'm retiring. Seymour, you can'’t retire. Not when people need you so much. Look, lady. I know what I am. A killer and a bum. That is what you were, Seymour. But not what you are. I'’m getting out of this lousy business. So don'’t kid me, Mrs. Quigley. Seymour, anything that does good in the world is not lousy. Only evil is lousy. And evil may have been what you were but not what you'’re going to be. Seymour, I have an idea. Come with me. [Flint] I feel like a phony. It'’s easier this way. Lots of us are gonna wind up in places like this, Seymour. -It'’s inevitable. -Nightview? Were you in the war, Mr. Flint? [Flint] Where do you think I learned my profession? [Grace] Then you'’re entitled to the benefits of a place like this. Thank you. You know, I'’ve never known any old people before. [Grace chuckles] Neither had I until one day I looked around and discovered I was one. I guess I can do a lot of people some good, can'’t I? I told you, Seymour. Think of yourself as a doctor. A doctor saves the lives of those who want to live. You take the lives of those who want to die. Seymour, listen to me. Those five people who need your services are all lovely people. They need your help and your talent to free them of their misery. Seymour, listen to me. I was a good mother. I never told any of my children to do anything wrong and I wouldn'’t tell you. So be a good boy, Seymour. Help them, kill them. [Flint sighs] Five people. That'’s heavy. You can do it, Seymour. I'’ll need your help, Mrs. Quigley. Mrs. Quigley... [laughs] You sound so formal. What should I call you? Seymour, would you mind calling me Mom? Okay. Mom. It'’s been so long since anyone called me that. Well, here we are. This is it. [Flint] This is Morrison'’s place? He'’s got a nice house. Why would he want to...? Poor man. He'’s been so despondent since the death of his wife six months ago. He'’s looking forward to joining her. There you are, my dears. Here we are, Mr. Morrison. Are you going to do something now? Oh... What great looking cars! Do they run? -Perfectly. -May I...? Yes, of course. Of course. This one was my wife'’s, and that was mine. We used to race. -[laughs] -And they both still work? They purr like kittens. [doorbell rings] -Emily. -Ah, hi. I'’m sorry. I just got a call from my daughter. Your daughter, Emily? Yes, Grace, my daughter. She wants to see me next week. So I'’m going to have to pass for now. I haven'’t seen her in over a year. Whatever you wish, dear. But you do realize that the group rate may not be available later. I'’ll just have to take my chances. Emily is not going to be with us this evening. I'’m sorry, but I'’m sure you understand. [Emily] My daughter. [Grace] Emily, I'’m sure that the group is most sympathetic. But you must swear never to tell anyone about our solution. It could only cause embarrassment to the memory of everyone here, as well as to myself and Mr. Flint. [Emily] I'’ll never tell anyone. It'’s such a wonderful service and I want to thank you for the opportunity to participate. Have a nice evening. [engine starts] -[engine stops] -Oh... [Grace] I want to assure all of you that you have no need to worry or to be afraid, and if you want to change your mind, now is the time to do it, and your money will be refunded. -Any questions? -No questions. Just... -peace. -No questions either. No questions at all. Not a single question. Now... I'’m going to disappear for a minute. Have a little chat with our friend, Mr. Flint. In the meantime, Homer, why don'’t you play another song for them? -Delighted. -What about "Irish Eyes"? Aye... ♪ When Irish eyes are smiling ♪ ♪ Sure is Like the morn in spring ♪ ♪ In the lilt ♪ -♪ Of Irish laughter ♪ -Wonderful.

May I put something on your bulletin board? -Go ahead. Who cares? -Thank you. -[Grace] May I...? -Go ahead. [Grace clears her throat] -May I? -Suit yourself. [Grace] You haven'’t a thing to worry about. Good morning, everyone. Next. Grace, you'’ve got to see me right now. But... All right, Emily. Patience. -Patience. -[people complain] Busy, busy, busy. I want to sign up again. And this time I mean it. My daughter only wanted to borrow money, you see. That disappearing daughter? -Are you suggesting she...? -I'’m not suggesting anything. Do sit down. I just, umm... I just have to warn you that because of the risk involved, our fees now start at 1,000 dollars, but because of our friendship, you only have to pay 750. I'’ll pay. How long will I have to wait for treatment? There are eight people ahead of you. My associate is on his honeymoon, so you'’ll have to be patient. In the meantime, you might find comfort in attending the funeral or our four friends from the Morrison house. They'’re all going to be buried in the same cemetery this Saturday. I better not. I'’m afraid I'd feel jealous. As you wish. I know someone else'’s funeral is not the same as one'’s own. But it'’s going to be a gala affair. I'’ll think about it. Hello, Ma. Just got back in town. Decided to cut the honeymoon short. No, no, no. Muriel doesn'’t mind. She understands that people need me. Look. Could you take a cab and meet me at my place? I'’ll be right over. I have a lot to tell you. Sorry everyone. That'’s it for today. Pass these around for me, will you? After I'’ve gone, I want you to all have directions to our presentation this week of four satisfied customers. You can bring your friends if you like. -Don'’t miss it. -[people groan] Taxi! Taxi! 13304 Riverside, please, driver. And hurry. Anything you say, lady. You know the way? -No, don'’t you? -Sure I do. I even know a shortcut. [radio] Rudy, tell my old lady I want dinner on the table... -[Grace] Driver. -...when I knock off at seven. And get a six-pack, okay? Are you sure that this is the right way? You say I'’m giving you the run-around, lady? Well, Mr. Putnam, your shortcut has already taken 15 minutes longer than the bus. Lady, just get off my back, will you? The traffic'’s awful bad. Jesus. [car honking] [driver] Blow it out your ass! Here we are, lady. I told you we'’d make it. -It'’s $9.80 on the meter. -Oh, dear. I'’m afraid I only have a twenty. The hell you think I am? The Federal Reserve? Well, you stay here. I'’ll go and get it changed. I'’m not falling for that. I ain'’t getting stuck with no $9.80 tab. Why don'’t you just leave me something as a deposit so I make sure you come back? Take my watch. Junk. It'’s worth two bucks. Why don'’t you come with me then? Why don'’t you just leave me your shoe? My shoe? That'’s right, your shoe. That'’s something I figure you'’ll come back for. Hey, Granny. I keep the meter running, so don'’t be too long, okay? Don'’t slam the... door. [doorbell rings] Hello, there. Could you give me two tens? A pig of a taxi driver wouldn'’t change this twenty. -Where'’s Seymour? -He'’s in the shower. Oh, thanks. Mom, you look shorter than I remember you. What? Oh. [chuckles] Thank you. Hey, sugar! [Grace] Mr. Putnam. Change, please. Lady, it was $9.80 on the meter. Change, please. Here'’s ten cents. There'’s twenty cents. Thank you. Sorry I took your shoe, lady. What I should have took was your foot. Hey! My shoe! My... [doorbell rings] -Come in, Ma. -Thank you. Where'’s he? Where'’s he? -Mom! -Oh. Hello. I'’ve never been so anxious to get back to work in my life. Good, good. Would you mind going into the bedroom so Mom and I can talk? -Feeling better? -Oh, yes. Yes. No headaches, no nosebleeds. -It'’s only because of you, Mom. -Umm. What happened to your shoe? Stolen. In broad daylight. -My best pair. -Oh, gee. It'’s terrible, Mom. All right. So what do you got lined up for work? I already have ten people lined up. Great. Who are they? What are their problems? They all meet the necessary qualifications, that is, except for one. I'’d like you to throw him as a favor to me. -Who'’s that? -A man named Max Putnam. I'’ll get his address. He'’s a cab driver. I think it'’d be a better world with him dead. What does Max Putnam think? I haven'’t asked him. He probably wouldn'’t agree. Well, what did he do? He took my shoe. -What? -He took my shoe! You want me to kill somebody because they took your shoe? Seymour, it was my best shoe. Mom, you'’re asking me to commit murder. Son, I may ask you to kill, but I would never ask you to murder. Call it "pest control." -Ma... -It'’s not funny, Seymour. [Dr. Herman] Don'’t be so disillusioned. People are people, and all people are subject to corruption. Not her. She'’s a good lady. Listen, doc. Don'’t you call her corrupt! Only I can call her corrupt. What are you feeling right now? Put it in your own words. Hum? Hum? All right, let the head go. Let'’s loosen it up, roll it around. Take the deep breath. -[both exhale] -Okay, Seymour, you have developed what we call a mother fixation. That'’s why you're so upset. -I never had a mother before. -Exactly. Grace has become the mother that you never had. What has she done? She'’s allowed you to continue in the profession of your choice by convincing you that your skills are now being used for humane reasons. She'’s removed all sense of guilt -connected with your job. -I never felt guilty before I met her. For Christ'’s sake, doc. It was just a job. It was a job I was good at. Cut it out, Seymour! Cut it out! Okay? You and I both know there is a certain amount of guilt connected with your profession. You can deny it. But it'’s my job to make you realize that you have feelings of guilt. Once you realize that you feel guilty, then you don'’t have to feel guilty anymore. You know, doc? I never realized it before. But lately, since I met that old lady, I think you'’re right. I was feeling guilty about something all these years. Breakthrough. Bravo, bravo. [beeping] Whoops, that'’s the hour, Seymour. But I'’m telling you that'’s wonderful progress. Wonderful, wonderful. Now don'’t worry about it. We'’re gonna work it out next session. There'’s nothing wrong with guilt once you admit it. Wait a minute. I don'’t like it. Let'’s work it out. Wait. You know the ground rules. There'’s a patient out there. Would you like to wait if you'’ve got a problem? Yeah, but I'’m in here with a problem. I finally realized after all these years I feel guilty about something, but I don'’t know about what. I think you owe this lady a giant debt of gratitude. She'’s put you in touch with your conscience. Doc, she'’s getting corrupted. You said so yourself. And I'’m corrupting her. There'’s give and take in everything, Seymour. Let'’s go. Let'’s go. Wonderful progress. [Grace] Hmm-mm. Good morning, Dr. Herman. [clears throat] I'’m Grace Quigley. Seymour spoke so highly of you, I thought perhaps you could help me with a problem. My fee is 75 dollars an hour. Can you afford that? I'’ll pay it. Now what seems to be the problem? Dr. Herman, I love Seymour like a son. And yet in these last few days I'’ve been having these terrible thoughts about turning him in to the police. When did these thoughts first come to you? The other day, when I asked him to do me a simple favor. And he refused. I... I talked to him like a mother but he doesn'’t listen to me like a son. Mrs. Quigley, wouldn'’t it be a shame if Seymour had to go to jail now? It would put an end to your humanitarian enterprise. So far I haven'’t done anything, except to write a letter. What kind of a letter, Mrs. Quigley? Well, a letter explaining my dealings with Mr. Flint. In case anything unpleasant should happen to me. I'’ve asked a friend to forward it to the district attorney'’s office. [clears throat] Mrs. Quigley, I'’d strongly suggest that you get that letter back just as soon as possible. I think I have a better solution. You talk to Seymour. Tell him how important it is for a son to listen to his mother. Specifically, I'’d like Mr. Putnam rubbed. That'’s great. Great! I thought the old lady might call me. I didn'’t feel like talking to her. I think that you better talk to her right now. And I think that you better talk very convincingly, because if the letter that your nice old lady wrote ever gets to the district attorney'’s office, both of us are going to be very inconvenienced, especially you. Doc. I think she was just kidding you. -Mom wouldn'’t do that to me. -Well, I suggest that you call Mom and you ask her. Don'’t think just because you never had a mom that all moms are perfect. You should have met mine. -Yeah, Ma. It'’s Seymour. -Hi, honey. -Hi. -[Dr. Herman] Hi. Give Ma my love. [Flint] Ma? Ah... Dr. Herman stopped by and mentioned a letter. I know you were just kidding. No, I wasn'’t, Seymour. And I'’m much too tired to talk about it tonight. And the funeral'’s tomorrow. Mrs. Quigley! [suspenseful music] [Muriel] Honey, where are you going? To a funeral. [funeral director] Yet who are we to judge the action of these four dear friends? Who are we to say that this should be a time of sadness rather than joy? For I read to you now, at his written request, the words of our dearly departed Homer Bradley Morrison, through whose kindness all the expenses of today'’s services have been paid. "Dear anybody who cares. Crying for me I don'’t need. My life mostly has been pretty good. But lately not so good. Life is too beautiful to walk around dying, and when dying is all you think about, then you'’re better off dead. So live and be happy everyone. Flowers are unnecessary. Donations may be sent to the antique car wing -of the Smithsonian. -[crying] Thank you, anybody who cares. Homer Bradley Morrison." Amen and rest in peace, Samuel Irving Pincus, Dorothy Trugert, Sara Hodgkins, and her faithful cat, Winnifred, and Homer Bradley Morrison. [Emily] Grace! Grace! It was so beautiful. I could hardly stand it. I'’m glad you enjoyed it, Emily. I hated it! Every minute of it! There they were, happy at last. Their problems solved. And I could have been with them. All expenses paid. -Gang way! -Oh, oh! Sorry about that. He'’s an artist. Your friend is an artist. You know that, Grace? I suppose you'’re right. I never thought about it that way. Grace, when? I have to know. I can'’t wait. When? Emily, I am afraid I cannot tell you that. But why not? Why can'’t you tell me? It seems that the artist has become temperamental. Ultimate Solution may have to suspend operations. For how long? [Emily] Grace, for how long? Indefinitely, I'’m afraid. But don'’t worry. All deposits will be immediately refunded when necessary. I don'’t want my money. I want what I paid for. Grace, is that him? [Grace] Yes, I think so. Then hurry. Let'’s go talk to him. I'’m not sure that he's here to talk, Emily. Mrs. Quigley, we'’re nearly on our way. Excuse me, Emily. Mr. Killer, I have to talk to you. [Flint] Get out of my way, lady. Please, I'm first. I made a bad mistake with my daughter. I should have been in there with them. All expenses paid. But now I'’m ready. I'’m first. It'’s okay. I don't mind. Do it. Where are you going? Yoo-hoo! Mr. Killer! You can'’t leave me like this. I paid my deposit! [driver] Hey, hey! My car! Get in the car! Come on! Oh, shit. Hey! -I think you... -Oh, oh! Hey! [men complain] Oh! Joe, what are you waiting for? Come on! Go, go. Come on. Come on. Mrs. Quigley, hurry. Remember your car assignments? I'’ll come along with you. Now, get in. Shove over. Move it! [tires screech] [tires screeching] I beg your pardon. [folk rock music] [tires screeching] [grunting] [tires screeching] Oh! [cars honking] [cars honking] In God's name, get started! [funeral director] Tim, where are you? [funeral director complaining] Step on that! [tires screeching] Wasn'’t that Mrs. Watkins driving that Hearse? Strong resemblance. [Grace shrieks] -Driver! -Seymour! Seymour! Seymour! Seymour! [motorcycle crashes] [gasping] [funeral director] Mrs. Quigley. Mrs. Quigley! I'’ll get the police! -Are you all right? -What difference does it make? Don'’t you care about what happens to you? -No, I never really did. -Well, I do. And I certainly wouldn'’t want to witness your capture in front of my very eyes. Ma, I tried to kill you. -[police siren] -Yes, a very sloppy job. I tried, I just couldn'’t do it. Why did you do it? I'’ll... What difference does it make? We'’ve got to get out of here. It'’s smoking. It'’s no use. The crankcase is busted. Get off. -Are you all right? -Yes. [tires screeching] Oh...! ♪ When Irish eyes are smiling ♪ ♪ Sure is Like a morn in spring ♪ ♪ In the lilt Of Irish laughter ♪ ♪ You can hear the angels sing ♪ ♪ When Irish hearts are happy ♪ ♪ All the world Seems bright and gay ♪ ♪ And when Irish eyes Are smiling ♪ ♪ Sure they'll steal Your heart away ♪ Looks as if Emily has got a freebie. [Grace] That hat. Emily'’s hat, popping up and floating off, floating away. That was rather sad, wasn'’t it? -It'’s what she wanted, Ma. -Hm. The lousy cab driver. Why is he so important to you? He'’s just a small nothing in the general mess, I suppose. I thought I could help clean up the universe. I was wrong, wasn'’t I, son? You'’re never wrong, Ma. Well, don'’t let's talk about it. Let'’s just float along, like Emily'’s hat. ♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪ ♪ Gently down the stream ♪ ♪ Merrily, merrily Merrily, merrily ♪ ♪ Life is but a dream ♪ [Grace screams] [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] [Flint] Mom, this is for you. Seymour, it'’s so late. I did it, Mom. Putnam's dead. I did what you wanted. I did it. Oh, my God! Seymour, what have you done? -Oh! -Oh, that'’s nothing, Ma. That'’s just that lousy nosebleeding that Dr. Herman was gonna cure. Mr. Putnam. I told you not to do anything about Mr. Putnam. We agreed that you were right and I was wrong. I know you didn'’t mean that when you said that, Mom. How could I be right and you be wrong when you're the one that taught me the difference between right and wrong in the first place? No, I knew that Mr. Putnam had to go. I mean, Ma, you and me, we got to clean up the universe, isn't that right, Ma? You said that. You said that we just got to clean up the universe. Isn'’t it what you said? I mean, you said we got to clean up the universe. -[sobs] Ma... Ma... -It'’s all right, Seymour. It'’s all right. It'’s all right. -[sobs] -It wasn'’t your fault. It'’s all right. Mom, I don'’t want to kill anymore. I just don'’t want to do it anymore, okay? [Grace] Don'’t worry, Seymour. -It wasn'’t your fault. -[parakeet chirps] Shut up, Oscar! And you know what we can do tomorrow? We can all go to the beach. That'’s what we can do. You, me, and Muriel. We can even take Oscar. All of us. You'’ll feel better then, you'’ll see. We'’ll have a happy time. You'’ll see. You'’ll see. [police siren wailing] [Grace] And lead us not into temptation. For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen. It'’s all my fault, isn't it? He did it to please me, the good boy. He'’ll be better off without me. What the hell are you doing? I'’m... trying to kill myself. -What do you think? -I'’ve been looking for you. -I was worried about you. -It'’s too late for that. I don'’t deserve to live. Nobody does. It just happens. Seymour, we'’ve killed an innocent man. No, no, Ma. Jenkins and the other people -they wanted to die. -Not Mr. Jenkins. That pig of a taxi driver. You didn'’t kill him. I did. But you did it for my sake. -Maybe he'’s not dead. -Not dead? -But you shot him. -Yes. But maybe he didn'’t die. Didn'’t you check? Seymour. Where did you shoot him? -In Brooklyn. -Ah... No... Where, where? In the head? In the chest? -Where? -In the cab. In the cab? What'’s that supposed to mean? He was in his cab, and I aimed, and I missed. You missed? Yes, I missed. But, last night you... Seymour! I could have killed myself! I could be lying dead down there in the muck! 21 stories, Seymour. I'’m sorry, Ma. So am I. Well... I guess this is the end of us. You don'’t need me anymore. What, dear? I just don'’t like shooting people anymore. I know what you mean. Well... -Let'’s go home. -Can we? Hmm-mmm. [jumbled chatter] Customers. Taxi! [people complain] Where to? [both laugh]
