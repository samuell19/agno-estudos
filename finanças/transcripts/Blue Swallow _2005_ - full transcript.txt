She's still rising up! 4,500 meters! No oxygen at that altitude! It's dangerous to go up more! Park Kyung-won! Chudanuma is currently first place, but Park Kyung-won wins if she returns in time. Park Kyung-won passes the clouds and spins. She descends aggressively! But there isn't enough time! She descends at full speed! About 2,000 meters left! Now 1,000 meters left! She increases speed! It looks dangerous! She's descending at a huge speed! Turn up the nose, Kyung-won! Park Kyung-won quickly raises the nose! Park Kyung-won! Fantastic! Such incredible flying skills! She's rushing to the finish line at full speed! There's barely enough time. Nine seconds. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. She did it! Success! Park Kyung-won has done it! Park Kyung-won has won! Tachikawa has won the tournament! Park Kyung-won is absolutely amazing! Park Kyung-won slowly walks out! The crowd cheers her on! What a dramatic moment! A dramatic feat overcoming all difficulties! Absolutely incredible! Park Kyung-won raises her hand! What a touching moment! Tachikawa Flight Academy is filled with cheers. Park Kyung-won displays an incredible finale at the National Flight Tournament! I feel so bad. For being mean to Segi. I can't believe that he's dead. I don't knowwhat I can say about Kang Segi. Anyway, congratulations again on your win. It was the best flight I've ever seen. Foreign Affairs Ministry Dinner Invitation for Female Pilots You've invited the world-famous female pilot, Victor Bruce. Who will you send out for the greeting flight? We'll have to showthat we also have excellent female pilots in Japan. We only have Miss Gibe and Miss Park Kyung-won. Of course Park Kyung-won is going. She's the winner of the tournament. You've revealed your ambitions of a long-distance flight. Does that mean crossing the Pacific or the Atlantic? It's difficult to say right away. I'll try to fly home first. Does home mean Korea? - Yes, well... - Please, that's enough for now. Let's cheer once more for the winner, Park Kyung-won. Everyone, let's congratulate the winner. Cheers! 9,000 yen just for visiting Korea? - Yes. - That's tremendous. That money could buy several houses. When will you save up that much? I'd have to request help from the Korean Society. A long-distance flight. You like the skies that much? - Yeah. - More than me? Yeah. When you're up in the skies, it doesn't matterwhetheryou're a Korean, a Japanese, a woman, or a man. - That's why I like the skies. - I like the land better. - I like the skies. - I like the land you're on. -You like the skies, don't you? - No, I like the land. - Then you can come with me. - To where? You can be my navigator. I'm a meteorology officer. I have no idea about navigation. I'm sleepy. Meeting people all day has worn me out. - Very nice. - What is? Your guitar sound. Play it until I fall asleep. Not for free. Satisfied? I'm taking the level-two test soon. Wow, you're prettier than Kyung-won. Here we go. One, two... Feels like yesterday when I had a hard time trying to cover you. Park Kyung-won, you must be a star now. Just a word from Park Kyung-won makes everything okay now. How about another photo? Haven't you gotten in touch with home yet? I don't understand, sir. You father has become an assemblyman in Seoul. Congressman Park Choon-shik in Tokyo told me. Congressman Park is my close friend. - I heard he's close to yourfather. - Yes, sir. Yourfather and Congressman Park are bringing some Japanese lawmakers for a cherry blossom flight next week. And to see you as well. - Manchuria is about to go to war. - But some people are having a good time. - The rich must be happy. - A cherry blossom flight during these times? Hey, Han Ji-hyuk! - You? - Of course. I was the first to write about her in the Osaka Korean Society Paper. That article made her famous in Korea. It got her a Donga Daily interview, and the Korean lmperial's support. Park Kyung-won had it hard long ago. Anyway, she seems to be struggling to prepare her long-distance flight. I can't just sit around. I should help her. - Did you meet Park Kyung-won? - Yeah, for a moment. Also, you're not gonna mooch like you did before, are you? I have to stick around for a few more days. I haven't finished covering Park Kyung-won. She's busy for a few days because of a fund-raising event. I guess it worked out. You and l... Hey! Hey! Fundraiserfor Park Kyung-won's Long-distance Flight I'm Park Kyung-won. Thank you for coming. My life-long dream was this long-distance flight. I'm preparing a flight to Korea as the first step. What I need the most now is your support. Today, we've opened our first fund-raising event here in Osaka, home to many Koreans. I can only endure 30 minutes at an altitude of 1,500 meters. I learned I had a lung problem after I became a pilot. I was devastated having to give up a long-distance flight. It's fortunate enough that I can do a low-altitude rally at least. Seeing that there's someone like me, don't be so devastated. Cheers! So Park Choon-shik is coming, huh? You knowthat they stick together all the time. Park Choon-shik is following your father for his money. He became a Tokyo Assemblyman for recruiting Korean soldiers, and for helping bury the Koreans massacred in the Kanto earthquake. That bastard. I didn't mean yourfather. Why not? He went as far as demonstrating the recruitment, even on a personal level. By making his son wear a Japanese uniform like this. I don't know anymore. The Koreans' response wasn't as good as I had expected. Some even called me a traitor because it's a Japanese plane. Why did you drink so much? You can't even drink. Are you okay? I'm just feeling down. I'm more down than you are. Are you okay? I feel terrible. Going out tomorrow, too? To Tokyo. Gibe will introduce me to some important people. Why don't you just live with her? Ji-hyuk. It's Jung-hee. - Jung-hee! - Kyung-won. Kyung-won, I sawthat guy when I went to Ji-hyuk's place. - Who? - The reporter from the Osaka Korean Society. He said he's Ji-hyuk's friend. Howwas the fundraiser? Were there a lot of people? Japanese Women's Aviation Association The fundraiser's outcome until now isn't so good, but let's not give up. Let's expand our contacts to cultural and business groups. Park Kyung-won will fly out to greet Victor Bruce, so we'll receive more attention than now. Park Kyung-won's long-distance flight should be emphasized as the first for an Asian woman. Park Kyung-won Fundraising Association Let it go if you're ready. - He's weird lately, isn't he? - Woman problems? They should send out Park Kyung-won for the cherry blossom flight tomorrow. I heard Korean congressmen are coming. Whether she's Korean or not, I wish I could sleep with her. Bet it feels like I'm flying like that balloon. What did you just say? What, damn it? What the hell do you know about PARK Kyung-won? Yeah, I'm a Korean, too! You sons of bitches! Think you have the right to talk about Kyung-won like that? Let me go, you bastards! Let go! I thought Koreans would help me more than others would. Cheer up. Many Japanese sponsors are still left. Thanks for bring me home. Take care. What happened to your face? I'm fine. - Let me see. - I'm fine. Did you fight someone? I'm gonna quit the Meteorology Center. Why? Kyung-won. Let's get married. Why all of a sudden? I don't know. I feel as if I don't marry you now, I never will. - Did something bad happen? - No I'm just sick of everything. And I feel uneasy. I just want to be with you. It's not too late marrying first and then going to Korea. I'll let you fly and do anything you want. You know it's hard for me now just preparing for this flight. I'm too busy to think about other things. After Korea, then Manchuria. After Manchuria, then Europe. - So you'll marry me after you reach the end of the world? - You know I didn't mean that. Then just say you don't want to marry me. So that I can give up early. Let's talk later. - What's with you all of a sudden? - I told you I feel uneasy! I feel uneasy about living like this. About you flying away from me, and just about everything. Don't you know how I feel? Can't you see that I'm preparing my flight on my own? How can I deal with marriage on top of this? Don't you think I feel uneasy about things, too? So marriage first... I don't knowwhy you're acting like this. But my head is too cluttered now, so let's talk later. Kyung-won. Let's talk about this later when we feel comfortable. Didn't we have some booze left? Don't we? Over 200 hours for a solo flight, and tournament winner. Incredible woman, coming here alone. - And now her long-distance... - Not sleeping? After I finish up my report. You sleep first. Welcome Congressman Park. The regiment commander has prepared a new biplane for six people and a veteran pilot for our guests. Thank you very much. Thank you. Congratulations again for becoming an assemblyman. Thank you. He's even dedicated his precious only son to the great Japanese lmperial Army. What a beautiful day! You came at the peak season for cheery blossoms. The flower blooms as if they've waited for you all! You must be happy. You sent me to the army and became an assemblyman. All your dreams have finally come true. What? You good-for-nothing. Miss Park. Could you turn a little to the left? Yes, good. One moment. Hey! Han Ji-hyuk! Father! Hail the Korean Red Fellowship! Hail Korea's independence! Father! Father! Kim Sang-soo, a fellow Osaka University alumni. You've been witnessed hanging around him for a few days. Park Kyung-won was being watched to be a suspect of impurity. We've found you to be her boyfriend, so don't make any excuses. How did Kim Sang-soo knowthe date and time of the cheery blossom flight? You said the cheery blossom flight is at ten tomorrow morning, right? To kill in broad daylight and on an army base, do you think that's possible all by himself? -Who else is there in the army besides you? - What? The Korean Red Fellowship! He interviewed me a fewyears ago. All the articles are still there. I knew him just as a reporter. I found out just recently. That they have been seeing each other. Han Ji-hyuk is your foster brother, right? And your tuition came from his home? Yes. So I can never fly a plane again? Hurry and sign it. This is your only way out of here. You, however, still have a lot of answering to do. I knew it when she mentioned home. At that time, it was a good idea to put her name on the warning list. A long-distance flight? She got herself caught up with the wrong man. Let's see how much you can take! A violent commie group terrorizing Japan's key figures. You must know more about the Korean Red Fellowship. Your boyfriend is a member, right? Sign if you want to sleep. Sign now! Not Park Kyung-won. But you've already announced that Park Kyung-won will fly to greet Victor Bruce. What will you do now? I don't want to make Park Kyung-won into a heroine. But making her into a heroine could benefit you. If you make Park Kyung-won into a world female pilot, Iike Victor Bruce or Amelia, it could be your best PR in terms of political power. By being her sponsor, you will be under the press's spotlight. To seize great power, you must utilize the press and public well. Don't you agree? Han Ji-hyuk is a member of the Korean Red Fellowship, right? Han Ji-hyuk is surely a member of the Korean Red Fellowship, but there's no evidence on Park Kyung-won. But if we want to get Han Ji-hyuk's confession, we need to hold on to Park Kyung-won. Nearly all the foreign press are in Japan now, and they all knowthat Park Kyung-won will make the greeting flight. It's about our ministry's reputation, so can't the military help out? How could I be a member of the Korean Red Fellowship when my father got shot before my eyes? Does that make sense? So you have no ties to the Korean Red Fellowship? Do you? And Park Kyung-won, too? World Pilot, Victor Bruce, and Park Kyung-won They Meet in the Blue Skies World Pilot, Victor Bruce, and Park Kyung-won They could escape like Ahn Chang-nam in his plane to Manchuria? There is only one way to fly. Show in front of the public your loyalty to the Japanese Empire, then I'll support you as a world female pilot. If you do as I say, you can pass Korea on to Manchuria. How about it? Japan, Korea, and then Manchuria all unite in one 'friendship' flight. The minister said that all of Japan will start military pilot training on August 9th. Civilian flights will also be controlled by the army. Then it'll be hard for civilians to fly long-distance for a while. What? They must be preparing a big war. Everything is over if we're on a war basis. Collecting funds won't be easy, and you can't fly if the ministry doesn't permit it. You must act fast if you want to fly to Korea. Kyung-won. I'm sorry. Any visits and letters were forbidden. I know. But how? Gibe helped me. I came with her. Have a seat. But, what happened to your leg? I'm okay now. There's no more torturing. Ji-hyuk. You've got grey hair. Have you been doing well? Yes. How about the flight preparations? They'll let me fly only if I follow the Foreign Minister. Followwhat? A consolatory flight for Japan's army in Manchuria with the Japanese flag. I don't know. Worried about people calling you a traitor? But Korea hasn't done anything for you. Go. There's no other way. I'm so angry. Having to suffer like this makes me so angry. All you've thought about was flying. When did you everworry about being Japanese or Korean? Isn't it more outrageous you can't go after all this time? Everything comes to nothing if you lose me and yourflight. Time's up. Get up. Anyway, seeing you makes me feel better. Get up. Ji-hyuk! Ji-hyuk! I'll come back. I'll come back. I'll try to find a way, but since visits are forbidden it'll take time. By the way, when we visited Ji-hyuk last time, I signed the visitors' list, and I found Jung-hee's name. So I wrote down her address. She must've tried to have visited Ji-hyuk several times. Yokohama I have nothing to say to you, so go back. Jung-hee. I told you everything's over! My tuition, my allowance, they were all cut off! Coming here wasn't easy. Know how hard it was to come here? I went into that house as a maid when I was fourteen. I cleaned all the urine and waste from Ji-hyuk's paralyzed mother. I slaved for so many years. But look at my life now. What is this? It's all because of you! Why is it all because of me? If I hadn't met you, none of this would've happened! Ji-hyuk and I could've just gone on with our lives. What have you done while Ji-hyuk is in jail? The greeting flight? All you know is about yourself. The first female pilot in Korea? You think people will remember you like that? No way. I'll reveal everything. How Park Kyung-won lived day by day. Rotten bitch. Then howwas Park Kyung-won released? It seems Han Ji-hyuk have confessed, so they freed her. I made a request for her release, but the army listens to no one, let alone the Prime Minister. They needed Park Kyung-won to have Han Ji-hyuk confess. Anyway, since we're on a war footing they'll conduct his execution swiftly. No chance for an appeal? Are you out of your mind? He's been court martialled. At least the lieutenant general. It's an emergency! Connect me to the Regiment MP now! How much time do I have left? By every means I tried my best to transcend everything. But I couldn't help being afraid from time to time. I guess there won't be many people to remember a carefree guy like me, even if I die here, right? That's why I must've loved you since you've cherished every second. Because you have something which I don't have in my life. Nowyou'll cross the East Sea, then the Pacific, and the Atlantic. Then you'll fly to the end of the world. No matter what, you'll be remembered by many people forever. and I also will be so proud of you. Although I won't be able to see you fly high towards Korea, I hope you can carry my ashes to Korea with your very hands. Because I want to be with you. I hope nothing turns out empty. And I will pray for you until the very last moment. I love you Kyung-won. Tachikawa Assassin Partner, Han Ji-hyuk Executed I have to go. It makes me sick. I can't be here anymore. Kyung-won! You know, right? If you accomplish your dream, my dream will also be fulfilled, as a woman. What is your flight course this time? Depart from Japan, fly through Ulsan, Daegu, and Seoul in Korea. Then to Dalian in Manchuria. How long will it take? Seven nights and eight days. Your plane's name is "Blue Swallow" Any special meaning? Yes, my hometown has many swallows. Anyway, it's because I can go home. The Great March will start tomorrow. Did you sleep well? Mr. Tokuda. It's an honor being in charge of communications for your flight. Pardon? Since I've flown to Osaka before, I asked the dean to let me handle communications, and he gladly accepted. You know there could be a storm, right? I know. Be careful. Let's go, Ji-hyuk. August 7, 1933, 11:00am Up to now, the weather and air current are okay. Ninomiya Passing through She's heading for Hakone, but she said it's cloudy. She said it's raining. She's detouring to Atami Will Atami be fine? With rain and rough turbulence there, flying could be difficult. Vision clear Full speed Flying at low level There's a torrential rain warning in Hakone. Torrential rain warning? Report current weather conditions She has passed Hakone. The rain has weakened, so flying is possible. If she passes Atami, she'll have no problem going to Osaka to refuel. Torrential rain warning also in the whole Atami area. What? Report current weather conditions It's strange. There's no answer. Communication is getting worse. Are communications cut off? She isn't answering. Respond She's going to pass through. What? Pass through? Flights in the whole Atami area have been forbidden. Contact the Foreign Affairs Minister. What are you doing? I'm having her come back. The Foreign Affairs Minister hasn't given any order yet! I don't know when communications will cut off. I'm sure she's experiencing air turbulence now. We could lose her in any moment. I can't wait for the minister's decision! You have no authority! Her life is at stake here! The Foreign Minister orders her to return. Come back, Kyung-won. Turn the nose around It's an order What did she say? The same answer. She's passing through. Let me talk to her. Sis Jung-hee? Turn back Turn back Turn back I'm going... Turn back Last... chance... Kyung-won... Communications have been cut off! Do you have to do this? Do you? I'm sorry, Kyung-won. Kyung-won. Kyung-won! Kyung-won! Kyung-won! It rained all night. And I prayed for the rain to please stop, and to let me fly to my home in the morning. I fell asleep at dawn. I dreamed of being alone in the desert. Segi, Jung-hee, Ji-hyuk. Where has everyone gone? I miss everyone so much. But I guess I finally have to leave alone like this. To the world I sawforthe first time when I was eleven. "The happiest and sweetest moment is flying in the skies." Park Kyoung-won is the first private citizen woman aviator but there are also other admirable aviators such as Kwon Ki-ok who took an active part in Chinese army and Kim Kyoung-oh who is known as the very first Korean woman aviator after the liberation of Korea. It is also to be noticed that the characters and the incidents in this film are partly modified and dramatized as occasion demands. written and directed by YOON Jong-chan starring JANG Jin-young and KIM Joo-hyuk executive producer KIM Jae-young FUEKI Yuko HAN Ji-min special appearance by NAKAMURA Toru
