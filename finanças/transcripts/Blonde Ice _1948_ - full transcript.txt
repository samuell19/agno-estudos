THE ICE BLONDE I wonder what could be holding Claire back. Calm down. Better enjoy your last moments of singleness. Who are they? Friends of the bride, they work in the same newspaper as her. I wish you would hurry up. And to me that that troop returned to the newspaper as soon as possible. So is Claire. She is late even for her own wedding. Do you know something? I get along very well with her. - What do you mean? - Now I speak to you as an editor. Not like a hopeless lover. Claire will never be a good journalist, and you know it. Well I do not know. She has written more social media articles than anyone at the Tribune. - It takes talent. - No. Personality, Hack, friend, not talent. Okay, well, I appreciate her personality. You? I'm the one who got you discovered when she was just a typist making $18 a week. - You remember? - Very touching, yes. Put it when you write your memoirs. - She's marrying Hanneman now. - Listen to frustrated lovers. Look, if you had applied yourself to the task instead of talking so much, you would be in Hanneman's place now. Take one of mine. FOR AL. WITH ALL MY LOVE, CLAIRE. We all have memories, don't we, Les? Carl Hannemann, Do you agree to take this woman as a wife to live together, according to God's law, in holy matrimony? Yes I want. Claire Cummings, Do you agree to take this man as a husband to live together, according to God's law, in holy matrimony? Yes I want. I pronounce you husband and wife. You can kiss the bride. !! Congratulations!! - You're great. - Thank you. Grab it! June, don't tell me I'm going to lose another employee now. Don't worry, Mr. Doyle. I don't even have a boyfriend. Let's go cut the cake. We have to hurry if we want to catch the plane. I'm going right now. I just want to say goodbye to my colleagues. Okay, but don't be late. Thank you. Thank you. Guess who I am. Why have you gone out? Because I love you. Because you want me. But Claire... You are crazy. Don't you know what the words that have been said in there mean? What God has united, let not man separate. No one can keep us apart, Les. He would never have believed that you... Unless... You always complicate everything. no dear... It was kind of sadistic to invite me and the others to your wedding. But there is no one else. Only you. I will think of you on my honeymoon. Aren't you going to miss me too, Les? I know you will be very happy. Excuse me. I have the camera ready, Mr. Hanneman. I'm going to look for my wife. Didn't she see it? I think he will find her on the terrace. Carl! - How come you're not with the guests? -She was waiting for you, dear. - I've been a little entertained. - On the terrace? Haven't you been too affectionate to be a newlywed? Honey, don't be so suspicious. - It was just about Les Burns. - AND...? Was nothing. Just kiss goodbye to a friend. He has done them so much for my newspaper career... He's kind of like a brother. You will always be the man of my life, dear. Always. They are waiting for us. Shall we cut the cake? FOR THEM. WITH ALL MY LOVE, CLAIRE. Come on, let's go! I won! How much is paid? 10 to 80. 10 to 80 for two. Not bad I have won 540 dollars. Claire, you mean you bet $100 on that horse as a winner? Clear. You have to spend good money to earn good money. Let's see... I'll bet $500 on the second race on "High Heels." Come on. Wait, wait, that's crazy. You would only lose $100 if I don't win the bet. It's not about the money. It is for the principles. The principles? Carl, I don't understand you. With everything you have... I work hard to get it. I don't want to seem cheap... Betting a little money for fun is fine, but I have too much respect for money to throw it away betting on horses. Of course you are right. It's been crazy betting so much. - Forgive me. - Of course. Now, excuse me, I'm going to collect what I've earned. My dear Les: In three weeks I will be able to see you Poor stupid Carl tries so hard to be a good husband, but he does not get used to a sumptuous life like the one I have... Hello darling. Have you missed me? - You're back early. - I was at the barber's. Who do you write to? June Taylor, do you remember her? Les Burns's secretary. She was at our wedding. Do you want to read some of the terrible things I say about you? It's hard to believe that I'm so lucky that a woman like you loves me. It's true, dear. Every word of it. I'm sorry Claire. My dear Les! For June, huh? Now everything starts to make sense. Carl, my love. So it was a kiss goodbye to a friend that you gave Les Burns, huh? Well... - Well, what do you want me to tell you? - Nothing. I think you can't say anything. I'm glad I figured it out now. Carl, what are you going to do? I'm going back to San Francisco. We're done. - And what am I going to do, Carl? - What do I care about that? It's that I don't have money. Thanks to your great generosity. There you go for a week in a hotel. You got what you earned on the horses Live with it. I won't give you another penny. Oh no... You're not going to leave like that, just like that. I'm your wife, Carl. There are community property laws in this state. It won't be that easy for you. It will be very easy when I show this letter to the Judge. And I'll start divorce proceedings in the morning. Oh, Carl, honey, let's talk about this. It has been foolish. Get out of my way before I lose my temper. Please put me through to the urbanization doctor. Good morning, is this Dr. Hastings? I'm Mrs. Carl Hanneman from bungalow 9. Can you write me a prescription for sleeping pills and drop it off at the pharmacy? I need them right away. I won't be long in coming to pick them up. No, that will not be necessary. I'll go look for them later. Thank you. PILOT ACCUSED OF FORGERY A CHECK LEAVES JAIL I want a new set of plugs for the 42. All right, Blackie. PLANE CHARTER FLIGHTS - Are you Mr. Talon? - Yeah. I have to be in San Francisco tonight. And I must have come back in the morning. Can do it? - I can do it, but... - But what? If time permits and it pays me well - How much would it cost me? - 400 bucks. Why give me 500? I told him 400. I know he asked me for 400. I never made this trip and you never saw me do it. Understood? Clear. I don't even want to know his name. - I'm glad we understand each other. - Perfectly. If you wait there, I'll get everything ready to leave in a few minutes. - Hey, Jack, prepare the 41 for takeoff! - Understood! Room service please. Hi, I'm Mrs. Carl Hanneman, from bungalow 9. Could you send me a waiter with the menu? Thank you. - Good morning, Mrs. Hanneman. - Good morning, Victor. Let's see, I think I'll have orange juice, toast and coffee. That will be all. SPORTS COLUMN by Les Burns SAN FRANCISCO TRIBUNE How was the baseball game? It was not a game but a carnage: twelve to zero. - Is that all the mail for today? - Yeah. By the way, I should have told you earlier. but I'm going to have a small party with dinner included tonight for a couple who are friends of mine. You are invited if you have nothing else to do. Clear. What are they celebrating? They are going to get married soon. They are very nice. Ah, getting married... That's when the problems start. Office of Mr. Burns. Conference. Mrs. Hanneman calling you Tell me Claire. Hello Les. Good thing I found you in the office. - How was the honeymoon? She broke off. Carl had to march East yesterday. He said it was on business. He wanted me to stay here, but I won't. I'm going back to San Francisco tonight. - Does that make sense to you? - No, but so I can see you again. Look, I want you to get me a plane ticket. Reservations are difficult to make from here, but it will be easy for you. Okay Claire. I'll take care of it tomorrow. I don't want to wait for tomorrow. I'll be back tonight. All right, I'll take care of everything. I knew you would help me. Pick me up at the airport. I am impatient to see you. Goodbye Les. Goodbye Claire. hey june You call Hack Doyle and book an 8 o'clock flight from Los Angeles tonight. It's for Mrs. Hanneman. Are you going to meet her? Yes. Oh, I'm afraid I won't be able to make it to your dinner tonight. It doesn't matter. Apparently Claire can get what she wants from whoever she is and when she wants it. It is not like this? I didn't think she was going to see you again so soon, honey. It is wonderful. It's crazy. - And why have you come? - Don't know. I do. Because you still love me, don't you, Les? Maybe yes. I hope Carl stays in New York for a long... a long time. It seems strange that she would have allowed business to interrupt her honeymoon. I think the same. Are you sure he didn't have a problem? What kind of problem could he have had? A fight or something, maybe it had to do with us. Do not be ridiculous. Why would he doubt me right after we got married? What will you do now? You don't feel sorry for Carl, do you? No, indeed. But should. Let's forget about him, at least for a few days. Take me Home. I'll change and we'll both go to dinner. Claire, I'd rather not go to your house. But I have to bathe, honey. I need it. Don't you want me to look pretty? Just for you. You are already pretty. You see it? There's no one at home. Wait here, honey. I'll be down in a moment. Come here. My love! - Les, what's wrong? - Stay here. It's Carl. He has committed suicide. But why? Poor Carl! Claire, I thought you said he was in New York. That's what he told me. I don't understand. Why would he do such a terrible thing? You probably know the same as everyone else. It will be the first thing the police will ask you. You can't stay here, honey. I'll take you to Hack Doyle's. Where is the telephone? With the police station, please. I thought you and Hack were in Miami and that's why I brought her here. - I hope you can put her up tonight. - Of course. Stay as long as you want, Claire. Thank you, Mimi. You're very kind. Is incredible. What motive could she have? We were so happy! Completely happy... And now... Hack, Claire is staying with us for a few days. OK. We have plenty of room. The police are coming. Murdock said that he would come later. -Are you sure he was suicide? - Completely. A man in Hanneman's position, a beautiful woman, and all that money? - I don't understand. - Me neither. - Hello, Bill, come in. - How are you, Hack? - Hello, Claire - Hello, Bill. - I'm sorry about what happened. - Sit down, captain. Do you want a coffee? Thank you, Mrs. Doyle. I won't bother you too much, Claire. Just a few questions. Routine, she already knows. - OK. Sh e-she Les filled us in on the details over the phone. Her husband has been dead for about 24 hours. How come she met Burns at the airport? It was not coincidence. I called him from Los Angeles. Why did she do it? She was going to be late and alone. She knew that she would agree to pick me up. Do you have any idea why her husband came to San Francisco after telling you that she was going to New York? No. I didn't know anything about her business. The gun was Hanneman's. We check the serial number. It is curious that there were no powder burns on the coat. Bill, sometimes a suicide bomber doesn't hold the gun to his body. - In this case... - There wouldn't be any burns, I know. Does she know of any reason why her husband would take her life? No, I do not know. Did she have health problems? None that I knew of. But that could have been the reason. - Had they argued? - Oh no, we never argue. believe me. Every minute of our marriage was a minute of happiness. A whole week, huh? That will be all for now. We may want to talk to you later. Where could it be? - He's staying with us. - Thank you. - Hey, Bill... - Yeah? I assume you found prints on the gun. Hanneman's. Well no. Clean as a whistle. Is this the position in which you and Mrs. Hanneman found her husband? Indeed. One more question, Mr. Burns. His testimony in the coroner's survey says he didn't touch anything. It's true. And how does he know then that the man was dead if he didn't feel his pulse? Mr. Chalmers, I know a dead man when I see him, especially if 24 hours or more have passed. You deduced that Mr. Hanneman had committed suicide. Because? Well, everything seemed to indicate it. I don't think so, Mr. Burns. Mrs. Hanneman, you said that she had seen her husband alive on Monday afternoon, and the next night, Tuesday, she saw him again. Yes, but he was dead. I have already told you everything. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what happened. Was it customary for the servants to go on vacation when Mr. Hanneman went away, leaving the house empty? I... well, I don't know. I did not give those orders to the service. Carl, Mr. Hanneman, took care of those things. I didn't live there yet. I see that you also assume that it was a suicide. Naturally. It couldn't have been anything else. That's what Mr. Burns said. According to the scientific police laboratory, the gun found next to her body was the one that killed her husband. But there were no powder burns on Mr. Hanneman's clothing. No fingerprints on the gun, either. In addition, it could not have been Mr. Hanneman who fired it, since the test carried out on his hands looking for traces of gunpowder gave a negative result. What do you want to tell us? Simply this: Carl Hanneman was murdered. But unfortunately, I don't have enough evidence against you. You guys were out of town and we've verified your alibis. They are free to go. Let me give you some advice. I don't believe in the suicide theory, so the case will remain open. - See you later, Ed. - See you later, Hack. Good morning, Les. Just the guy I wanted to see. So that? I've been assigned to follow up on the Hanneman case. - How was that? - I asked. It's nonsense, because that's over. - It was an ordinary suicide. - Are you kidding? I've never seen anything in my life that stinks so bad. No fingerprints on the gun, and you call it a "suicide." And? What makes you so sure? Can you give me one good reason why Hanneman took his own life? No I can not. -Maybe he thought he had it. - Or maybe not. Meanwhile, if he found a reasonable reason... Who asked you to look it up, reasonable or not? I said that if I could find a reason, I would accept that it was a suicide. But if not, it must have been murder. You're still head over heels in love with Claire, huh, Al? Not anymore. Hasn't someone helped you in this to stay with Claire? A disgusting joke. In the meantime, friend, stay out of trouble. Or people will think it was you who shot Hanneman. - You've got a lot of work to do, Al. - Yeah, great, boss. I'm so sorry, Hack. - How was Claire this morning? - Don't know. She was sleeping when I left. Les, I am concerned about this matter. The police do not believe in the theory of suicide. Is that why you put Herrick to investigate the case? Maybe he can find a reason for suicide. What do you think? Well... Hanneman committed suicide. Nice try, Hack. You're almost as subtle as a punch in the nose. You think Hanneman was murdered, don't you? Maybe I'm protecting someone. It's possible, but I'd like to protect someone if it wasn't suicide. - Whom? - To you. Who had a better mobile? With Hanneman dead, you get Claire and a few million bucks. That makes sense to a lot of imaginative types in this town. I haven't believed it for even a moment. But it's worth Herrick's digging to convince me of suicide like that. Thank you Hack! But I didn't. Yeah? Sergeant Benson is here. what happens Do they ever stop working? Hello, Benson, what does he offer you? The district attorney wants to see you in the morning. He said it was important. Around ten. -Why does he want us? - They do not know? Ms. Hanneman has also received an invitation. See you tomorrow. THE DEATH OF HANNEMAN - MURDER The duty judge rules out suicide Herrick likes to load the inks. It's just an item. No one has been hurt. Still. ...by unknown person or persons. It could have been worse. The district attorney said that he wanted to frame someone. Tell me, Hack, do you think Claire could have shot her husband somehow? No. She was in Los Angeles the night of the crime. She couldn't do it. Hello, everyone. I hope I'm not interrupting anything important. Hello darling. You look tired. - Hello, Hack. - Good morning, Claire. It's a nice surprise. What can I do for you? I've come to rejoin my old job. - To start when? - Right now. After what's happened, don't you think you need to rest? Rest? The work will do me a lot of good. It will keep me from constantly thinking about poor Carl. After all, I have to move on with my life. - What is the real reason? - Well, I need some money. I have the house and the clothes, But I can't live on Carl's widow's pension alone. Don't you want me to have to sell my clothes to be able to eat? It is not like this? No. But I've already assigned your column. It is now carried by McCormack. But you're still the boss, Hack. Les, honey, wait outside. I want to talk face to face with Hack. I understand. You should have said yes, Hack. I know how those face-to-faces are. You want me to stay, don't you, Hack? Yes, but I was hoping you wouldn't ask me. You're sweet. Listen Claire! just work and no games. We already have enough trouble here for you to cause more. Why are you talking to me like that? I'm serious, Hack. I will try hard at work. For your own interest, I hope so. You are a charm. See you later. - See you later, Al. - Okay. Your friends are coming. Yes, old friends. Two martinis, please. Chicken salad? - Perfect. - Chicken salad for two, and coffee. - Les, do you know a good lawyer? - Yes because? I need one to deal with Carl's will. What about the lawyer Hanneman had? Phew! The guy is a jerk. I want someone trustworthy to take care of my interests. Well, we can try Lars Carlson. He is an inheritance specialist. Carlson, fine, I'll call you tomorrow. Do I know that man over there? Sure. This is Stanley Mason. Our newspaper endorses him for Congress. Of course! The campaign poster photos of him don't do him justice. I don't know how he does it but every time I see him he goes with a different girl. And? We'll have 4 manhattans, half French vermouth, half Italian. - We'll order food later. - I'll handle it myself, Mr. Mason. Thank you. Stanley... Isn't that Hanneman's widow over there? Yes, she is... very attractive, isn't she? Well, she likes to show off. Wouldn't it be nice if he took care of the inheritance? No, no, no... he's too busy with the election campaign. What a chance, Les. I would go to Washington Very well because? He is an important man. And I need someone with influence. He seems like the type of person who can get things done...quickly. I imagine he will be very capable. He'll probably make a good congressman. But personally I wouldn't vote for him. I want you to present it to me. You can choose a better one. Honey, don't be stubborn. I want to meet you. When you want something, he has to be on the spot, right? You know what I really want, Les. I know. A mature man like Hanneman, loaded with money, in a good position, at the top... You forget the most important thing. Really? Know? That's just the frame. You are the image inside. What pictures are they talking about? Sergeant Benson, does he want to sit with us? No, but Burns can come with me. I've been looking for you. The captain wants to have a little chat. Now. He is arresting me? No, it will only be an interview. - It will not last long. - A pity you didn't find me at 10. He was in the dentist's chair. - I'm sorry, Claire. - Easy, honey. I will wait for you here. Goodbye Les. Hello to. Don't tell me Les was eventually arrested for murder. Wouldn't you like to hear me say yes? Yeah. Well, don't stop printing the newspaper... yet. You are the most cold-blooded woman I have ever met. I don't think you care if this case is solved or not. Well of course I care. Really. Al, tell me, do you know Stanley Mason well? Fairly good. I've taken care of some of his commercials. Can you do me a favor. A big one. I want you to present it to me. It could be a good idea. I remember once I introduced you to a guy named Les Burns and I soon lost you. Sorry. - Stan, how are you? - Hello to. There is a girl there who would like to meet you. - It will be a moment. - Very good. Excuse me. Of course. Claire, this is Stanley Mason, Mrs. Hanneman. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Mason. - My pleasure, Mrs. Hanneman. Why doesn't she sit down? - I can only stay a minute. I know you must be thinking about his campaign, but being a lawyer he will understand what worries me. It is urgent that I find someone to manage my late husband's affairs. I thought maybe he could help me. He had no intention of taking any more jobs this summer. My campaign requires so much attention... But suppose you... come to my office around four o'clock, we could at least talk about it. Thank you. I appreciate it a lot. Here's the address. Until then. Oh sorry. - Thanks, Al. - You're welcome. I found you, Captain, just where I thought. With the grieving widow. That's assuming she's upset. - Forget it. Les, my friend, sit down. The last time he said to me, "Hi, Burns." Today he calls me "Les, my friend." What he wants? Just chat for a bit. Oh, I didn't know I was such an interesting person. You live in the Hannemans' neighborhood, don't you? No, and you know it. But you go there quite often, don't you? Yes, frequently. To visit some friends. Oh sure, that's right. Hack Doyle and his wife. June Taylor, that's a very smart young lady. Isn't that her secretary? Since when has she been so interested in my secretary? I thought you were a happily married man. Were you in that neighborhood the night Hanneman was shot? - It refers to me? - AHA. No, I wasn't. I was playing gin rummy in the newsroom. I went home to sleep around ten. She already read my statement and checked it. Come on, Murdock, what's on your mind? There is no record of where she was between 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. when she went to the Drake Cafeteria for breakfast. No one saw him in her apartment. There is nothing unusual in that. My neighbors are not nosy. I spent the night sleeping. You're a little irritable today, Les. Something is bothering you, right? I'm upset. Until you and the DA figure this out, no one can rest easy. We may have the answer sooner than you think. The police hope to catch the culprit within 24 hours. Can I put that verbatim in the newspaper? Make any jokes you want, Burns. He has been crazy about Claire for a long time. That's how it is. He thought she was going to marry you, but she married Hanneman. - That must have been a blow to him. - I'm not denying it either. So she must be holding a grudge against Hanneman for the prank. I guess so. You know, Burns? He has all the motives that someone can have to murder. You don't need reasons, Murdock. What you need is proof. Really? You just told me you were near Hanneman's house Monday night. It was not. And how do you explain his cigarette case being in Hanneman's garden? Still wet from the rain that fell on Monday. I don't have to explain anything. But to cool her horny mind, I'll tell her that I threw her out after the wedding. Anything else you want to know? Is not sufficient. Next time be more careful what she says to the captain. Listen, Mr. Benson, If I have hurt the captain's feelings or yours, stop me. So I can sue them and they'll end up issuing traffic tickets again. Have you rented that stool for a whole month? Hello, Les, friend... Where is Claire? Oh, Claire's not here. - I had a date. -She has she returned to the newspaper? No, by now, she must be entering the sanctuary of that brave and daring defender of civil rights. That distinguished candidate for the United States Congress. Mr Stanley Mason. Sounds like you're on Stanley's payroll. I introduced them. - You have a talent for those things. - Thank you. I think that's all the information I need, Mrs. Hanneman. I have no words to thank her for the effort she has made to serve me. Trust me, it's been a pleasure. A little pressure in the right places will make it all work out. Thanks again and... good luck in the election. Thank you. I suppose he'll be off to Washington right away if he wins. Yes, if I win. Is going to win. I know it will. Well, now I have to go. Can I take her somewhere? Sorry, not tonight. Mr. Burns is taking me home. He is the man who was with me today. I'll call her tomorrow. Maybe we could have dinner and continue talking about her problems. Gorgeous. Bye bye. Claire, don't you think you shouldn't stay at Hack's anymore? It may be somewhat uncomfortable. Do not be ridiculous. Come on. Roberts... - Good night. - Good evening, Mrs. Hanneman. We didn't expect him to come home. - We haven't prepared anything for dinner. - I already had dinner. Upload, please, the suitcases to my room. And you and Christine can take the night off. I won't need you Thank you. Ms. Hanneman, I wanted to tell you on behalf of myself and Christine that we are very happy that she is home and that we will do everything possible to make her feel comfortable. Thank you Roberts. Come on in, dear. You're not afraid of Carl's ghost, are you? - You'll never be happy here, Claire. - Crap. I'll make some furniture changes. That might help a bit. Les, what did Murdock want with you? He thought that he could have come here Monday night. - You didn't come, did you? - Of course not. And she thinks that he had a motive to kill Carl. And you did, if you had been that kind of person. Murdock just cast the line to see if you bite. He knows that I have been in love with you for a long time. - I told him. - Did you tell him? Why not? It's the truth. You want them to take care of you so they can leave me alone. - That's it, isn't it? - Yeah. - I told you I'd back you up. - And you have. And I love you even more for it. You know I love you, right, honey? I think so, Claire. But in a very peculiar way. I never should have married Carl. I never really loved him. But she offered me so much...things she'd never had before. Now it's all over. Is not over. He won't be until they find his killer. They will and then nothing can tear us apart. Never. - Claire, I wish I believed you. - It's accurate, Les, it's accurate. This information from an authoritative source predicts a result of three to zero. See you tomorrow at this same time. Signed: Les Burns. You have outdone yourself today. It is the best article of the last two weeks. Thank you. If you say so, it must be true. - Hi, buddy. - Hello, Herrick. Do you know something about your girlfriend? They have it. Murdock and the prosecutor have arrested her. It is useless for you to go and rescue her from her. Stanley Mason beat you to it. What do you want with her, Al? It seems they have a hunch that Claire made a trip back and forth the night of the murder to help Carl reunite with his ancestors. They think her alibi of being in Los Angeles all night is false. - It's ridiculous. - You should know better than anyone. June, hand over the article. Well, Al, you're just as smart as Murdock. He speaks. I do not think it is. But I know Claire better than he does. And I know you. Explain yourself. Claire was never interested in you, not before, during, or after her marriage. Although that doesn't prove it happened. but I would dare to bet that this was planned weeks ago by her and you. I'm tired of your dirty little jokes! Out of here! One moment. Look, boy, one of these days I'll be late and you'll have lost your teeth. Very good, boss. - What happened, Les? - Nothing, forget it. Whatever you want. - If they ask about me, I'm gone. - I'm wondering the same. Where is Mrs. Hanneman? I have to see her, is she home? -Yes, but now she was leaving. - It is important. - What's up, Les? - I've been trying to see you all afternoon. You didn't go back to the newspaper. Where were you? I was with Stan... with Mr. Mason. Speaking of inheritance. Oh, it would seem that you still had things to talk about. It's just business, Les. Come in, but I have little time. You've been drinking a little too much tonight, haven't you, Les? It's only been a few drinks. I was drinking at Renard's. And I've also been thinking. terrible things. - About me? - Yes, about you. - Murdock and the prosecutor questioning you... - Nothing to worry about. I'm not sure. - Why do you say that? - Were you here Monday night? That? You know not. I no longer know anything. I would not lie to you. Have I ever done it, Les? Claire, only two people would have profited from Hanneman's death. I am one, and you are the other. How dare you accuse me? You married Hanneman for this. You would have done it a dozen times. But I didn't kill him. How can you think that? I'm not saying that you did it, but if you know something, you have to tell me. - Were you here Monday night? - No! - You could have come to see someone. - Stop shaking me! - Well, tell me the truth! - Go away. I thought you were going to support me. - You're drunk! - He was trying to help you and help me. Oh! Help me? You're accusing me of murder. How do I know it wasn't you who killed him? You were in the city. Claire! I have as much right as you to accuse you. - But I'm not accusing you. - Get out of this house. I once said I didn't know what you were like Now I know. You are not a normal woman. You are not warm. You are cold as ice. Yes, like ice. An ice blonde. Out of here! - Oh, I thought it was... - Hello, Mrs. Hanneman. - I don't think I know him. -Of course, of course she knows me. let me through We'll talk better inside. Here. Tell me, what does she want? I saw her picture in the newspaper and found where she worked. I figured we could make a deal. A deal? I wanted to phone you last night, but you had company. I had to see her alone. - What kind of deal? -It seems that the plane that she took on Monday at night it was very profitable. -I paid her so that she would forget. I thought she could trust you. - Clear. Of course you can trust me. But it's hard to forget about a murder... for 100 bucks. You dirty traitor! I don't like those words. All right, we'll forget what happened to Hanneman. I'll second you on that suicide story, if she gives me some encouragement. Let's say... 50 grand. $50,000! I do not have that money. The will is being validated. I won't receive a penny for months. I can wait. But meanwhile... I'll take this. I know a little man who will give me money for it. Very good very good. But don't come back to this house anymore. But I will be in contact with you. Quickly, go out the terrace door. And don't forget, Mrs. Hanneman, the 50,000 thing was no joke. - I'm coming, Roberts. - Yes ma'am. Stanley, honey! Thank you. Well, he's not at Renard's either. I hope nothing happened to him. He will appear when he is knackered and finished drinking. Have you written this column by yourself? Someone had to do it. I hope they publish it. Very good! This will also serve to cover Les. - Do you really think it's okay? - Of course. I'll find him later. Don't worry about Les. He is probably expelling from his body more poison than he took. I hope so. Oh hello June. Can you give me another head please? Mine is about to burst. You must have visited all the bars in the city. I guess so. - What day is today? - Tuesday. Gosh! What happened to Sunday and Monday? - I've taken care of everything. - For sure yes. - Who found me? Hack Doyle? - No, Claire. Claire? You tried to convince the doorman to let you on the roof. It was the only way to reach the moon. Oh, wow! Moon... It seems that he wanted to do more than just a little trip. Drink this, he'll make you feel better. Yes. I have given you a horrible example, haven't I? No doubt you must have had compelling reasons for getting drunk. I was running from something. - Something that was not good for me. - You got it? Don't know. Not do it again. I assure. June... Well, I'd better get back to the office. Thanks for taking care of me, June. I'll be fine in a bit. - I can do it. - No hurry. Claire, I wonder which hangover you'll recover from first? I thought that was over, Claire. Les, I'm so sorry for everything I said the other night. I guess I was a bit confused. Sorry honey. I should have gone local to tell you those horrible things. I later realized the truth. You were upset because you love me. That was it, right? Maybe yes. - I couldn't believe that... - Let's forget everything. We know there is nothing to worry about. There never was. We know, right, Les? Of course I do, Claire. Clear. For the new congressman. May it be a long successful career. Thank you dear. Jeff! Don't you drink to that too soon? I would want to be as sure of my future in psychiatry as you can be of your future in Washington. Doctor, you were analyzing me while we ate dinner. Seeing how my mind works. Go ahead, it's very interesting. I have never been psychoanalyzed before and their deductions amaze me. Claire, I'm warning you, if she continues, she'll convince you that you're nuts, just because your father left you for another woman and your mother had to work hard. Stanley doesn't believe in the power of psychoanalysis, Mrs. Hanneman. But if I could spend a day in my office listening to my patients, I would see the logic behind my deductions, or those of any other psychiatrist. Don't worry about Stanley's cynicism, doctor. - Yes, Roberts? - A call for Mr. Mason. - Excuse me. - Of course. I told him at dinner that I thought than money, clothes, flattery, etc. they were a necessity for you. That some people are drawn to a goal without even knowing why. Is it a crime that she is ambitious? A crime? Of course not. Unless that ambition takes a wicked form and stop at nothing to get what you want. The females of the species are said to be more deadly than the males. - Go on, doctor. - I'm sorry for the interruption. He was my campaign manager. I have an interview on the radio tonight. - I have to go. - You can take me downtown, Stanley. - I'll go get the coat. - OK. - Will you forgive me, dear? - Of course I do, honey. I'm so proud of you! I almost forgot to give you some good news. I had lunch with the DA at noon and it looks like they're going to drop the Hanneman case along with other cold cases. In his opinion, it must have been the work of someone who broke in to steal. Oh what a relief! Now I can go with you to Washington with a clear conscience. You haven't told your friends about your plans, have you? Of course not. Great. We'll surprise them tomorrow night. Yes, it will be a big surprise. - Ready? - Yes, thanks. - Good night, Claire - Good night. Ms. Hanneman, please don't take my mind scan too seriously. She is a lovely host. - So do not worry. - I never worry. - Good night. - Good night. Say. Yes, I'm Mrs. Hanneman. All right, Roberts, I'll answer. Hello. Who? How dare she call me here? I had to do it. I have problems. I need pasta. You have to help me. The inheritance is still being processed. I told him: I have no money. Don't come to me with those. She is a smart woman. If she doesn't have it, she knows how to get it. I need at least a couple grand tonight. Otherwise, I will go to the police. I have nothing to lose. I have about $700 worth of jewelry. Very well, come alone. I'll wait for you on the old valley road. Be there in 20 minutes. - Have you been followed? - No. - And calm down. - I'm not nervous. You are. Okay, give me what you have and we'll see if it works for me. That seems fine to me. I owe two grand to a bookie. It's a bad business. She won't wait. They told me tonight: "pay up or face the consequences." They won't kill you for $2,000. They kill for much less than that. That's why I had to squeeze it. Thank you, Mrs. Hanneman. She wouldn't betray anyone... unless she had to. I wouldn't betray anyone either, Blackie... Unless he had to. We have received the first results from District 12. Mason, 311, Jeffers, 282 and Allan, 91. It's almost certain, right? They are as favorable as in 10. They could not be better I am grateful to you, Doyle. Without the support of his newspaper, it would not have been the same. Mr. Mason, we are delighted to have endorsed the right candidate. He's done well, Mr. Mason. Congratulations. Have you seen Les or Claire tonight? I think she's waiting to make a grand entrance. You've asked about them a hundred times, Hack. - Because? - Oh, nothing. Mr. Doyle? Looks like we have a new congressman. Yes that's how it is. I'm sure he will be good. I hope so too. He was our sponsor. - Hello, Claire. Hello Les. - What's up, Hack? Good night Claire. You are beautiful, as always. - Thanks, Stanley. - Hello, Les. Thanks for bringing Claire. A great night, huh? ...in third place Jeffers, with 162. Allan with 142 and Mason, 311. It really is spectacular. Come, Claire, I'll introduce you to some friends. You have the drinks there. Look, Les. There is one thing I want to talk to you about. - We'd better get something to drink first. - OK. Hey guys, how's the party going? At least the alcohol is good. June, you look beautiful tonight. It was about time you realized it. At work you don't look anywhere but the office. - Do you want a drink? - No, thanks; I'm served. Les, I'd like to talk to you for a moment. Excuse us. What is it about? - Did you come with Claire? - No, with my Aunt Martha, from Penobscot. I'm serious. She saw her arrive with me. It would be better if you forgot about her. Right now. What are you taking about? Things are now going well between us. Couldn't be sweeter. You should have seen her a while ago organizing the party tonight. How about a little speech, Mr. Mason? We are waiting for it. Come on Stanley! Yes, give a speech. - What I was missing! - Wait. A speech? Well, if they want it, I'll have to give it. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce a beautiful lady you know as Claire Cummings. I am delighted to announce that she has done me the honor to agree to become my wife. That was really a low blow. But I'm glad it happened. Someday I'll tell you why. Congratulations! - I congratulate you, dear. - What a speech, Stanley! - Surprised, Geoffrey? - Aren't you going to congratulate us, doctor? - It's usual. I don't like to interrupt, Stanley, but we need to talk about something. - It is important. - All right, Geoffrey. Excuse us. I know you'll like living in Washington. When do you plan to have the wedding? Don't look at me like that, honey. - What are you doing here? - I wanted to see you alone. Sure, another husband in sight. Alive or dead? I didn't get a chance to explain it to you. "No one will be able to separate us, Les." You and I. It was more effective last time, with the wedding march in the background. You're cruel. I didn't mean to hurt you, but I did, right? This is what worries me now. Not a slight tremor. - What about your heart? -Claire CummingsHanneman Mason. If you go on like this, your initials won't fit on the silverware. I can't help it, Les. I really love you, You can't give me the things I need. Money, power... those are my needs. Stop it, Claire. You are like a poison. A little kills you, but if you take a lot, it becomes an antidote. Very good honey. But if we really have reached the end, Stanley... Goodbye Burns. I would like to say something to my "girlfriend". Alone. Don't worry, Mr. Mason. neglect. You can start now. The echo of congratulations had barely finished and I find you in the arms of your old boyfriend. That was a stupid observation. I had to tell him one thing. You hadn't told him anything, and you told me you would. No... I couldn't find the words. Is that why you got angry? Oh, honey, let's not argue about that. - We can do it after the wedding. - There will be no wedding. What are you saying? I'm afraid we were wrong. You can't be serious. What will my friends think? - I wouldn't stand the humiliation. - Oh, you'll get over it. Possibly not as quickly as in your other marriages. Why are you talking to me like that? - What did that fake doctor tell you? - It does not matter. We made a mistake. Now let's forget about it, okay? But you can't leave me lying like this. He had plans for the future. Would you take me to Washington with you, away from these people, from the memories... I have to go with you, Stanley. I don't feel it. It's final. You should see a doctor, Claire. A doctor like Geoff. I looked for you at the party after he talked to me. I wanted to ask you something. Doyle told me where you were, but I didn't believe him either. Finding you here proved many things. You're not okay, Claire. IM perfectly. I didn't mean to spoil our thing. Let's at least have a drink as a farewell. No grudge. Really. - Why don't you prepare something? - It seems to be one of your customs. Claire! what have you done I did nothing. You killed him, Les. did i kill him? You do not remember? You came in a few minutes ago. You saw us talking. You were weird, like crazy. You said you were going to kill Stanley because he stole your girl. So you took a knife and... and you stabbed him. - You're upset. - Oh no. - Crazy. - No. No. I saw you do it. You dropped the knife and walked out. I tried to stop you. You came back a few minutes later. Right now. - You bloody murderer! - They, no! Mason, you've won! You have won the elections! Now you're going to... You see, Doctor, the evidence clearly incriminates Les Burns. Both I and the others sense that he is innocent. Which is why I'm asking you to help us prove that Les is innocent and Claire is guilty. Because as sure as my name is Hack Doyle, she's lying. I agree with you 100%. I am convinced that Mrs. Hanneman murdered Stanley. But because of her statement and the fact that Les had the knife in his hand when we walked in, the police can only come to one conclusion. I'm sure there's something I could help you with. Is innocent. I know. Look. You had good contacts in the Police Department. You must have come across these kinds of cases before. Now I know that Claire Cummings is a special case like no other. Yes, you are right, Mr. Herrick. At least I'll try. I'm so interested in finding Stanley's killer. as you are in proving Burns' innocence. I have a plan that could cause it to collapse. Wow, good morning, Dr. Kippinger. To what do I owe the pleasure of his visit? The pleasure is not mutual, Mrs. Hanneman, I assure you. I just came to ask you a question. Why did he kill Stanley Mason? That? - How ridiculous you are, doctor! - I am? I had a conversation with Stanley last night about his engagement. and I advised him not to go any further. It is logical to assume that when he told you that no marriage would take place, you killed him in a fit of rage. and then he made up a story to accuse Mr. Burns. It's the most absurd accusation I've ever heard. Forget Les Burns' fingerprints were on the knife and that they saw him holding it in his hand. The police know all those facts, doctor. Not all. Enough to convict Les Burns. - Do you mind if I finish my article? - Of course not. I suppose you'll tell the police that I killed Stanley and tell them that fantastic story to back up your claim. It won't look so fantastic to them, Mrs. Hanneman. I have discovered one or two flaws in your version. They will laugh at you. It's crazy and absurd! He is wrong. I've spent my life delving into twisted minds like yours. I worked many years for the police as a consultant psychiatrist. He looks more like a hypnotist. And I'm sick of his insane theories. Now, doc. - Looking for something, Hack? - The police are on their way. Police! So that? I see that the three of you have prepared this. Since you're going to get me arrested, you'll want to read my latest article. Go ahead and read it, Hack. Aloud. I killed Stanley Mason, I killed Carl Hanneman. - I killed Blackie Talon. - You didn't know anything about this Blackie, right? He's on page 5. Unsolved robbery and murder. I killed Stanley Mason because he didn't want to marry me anymore. Stanley Mason was for me to get to the top of the ladder. The last rung. He already had money. Now he was going to enjoy a position. He was going to take me with him to Washington. He could leave me without arousing suspicion from the police. Clever, don't you think? - Why did you frame Les Burns? - Because? Because he caught me with blood on my hands. Because he despised me. I never wanted any of them. Neither you, Al, nor Hanneman, nor Mason. But, Les... I wanted to keep it. He was no longer of use to me, but I couldn't let him go. Maybe she loved him. Say. Mrs. Cummings. No; she has gone out I'm glad he confessed because he couldn't have gotten away with it much longer. I could have, but you, Dr. Kippinger, you and your repulsive scientific intrusion... I saw from the beginning that you were the one who turned Stanley Mason against me. You are as guilty of his death as I am. Sit down, Claire. If it weren't for you, he would now have everything he dreamed of. He hated him because he was the first man that entered my mind. And now I'm going to kill him. let me go You're a little late, Murdock. Well, it's probably for the best that it happened that way. I can hardly believe it. A woman as beautiful as this. I didn't know her well. None of us knew her well. She wasn't even a good journalist. END
