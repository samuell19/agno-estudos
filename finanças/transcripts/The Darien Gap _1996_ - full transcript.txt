(film reel rolling) (guitar strumming) - [Voiceover] So, what's with the job interview? Good choice for that shirt there. It's nice. - [Voiceover] It's kind of a (lighting match) chemical problem. I mean chemistry with the guy. - [Voiceover] Chemistry? Dropped some bad acid? (men laughing) - [Voiceover] No. It just didn't click. (beer can opening) - [Voiceover] Show him you got some integrity. That always works, huh. - [Voiceover] As a matter of fact, that was the sticking point. (men laughing) - [Voiceover] I mean come on man, you're talking to us, you know. I mean, shit, we're your friends, we think. - [Voiceover] Dave. - [Voiceover] What? - [Voiceover] Do I need to bring up computers with you? Because that was the problem. (drink pouring) - [Voiceover] Yeah, they suck. - [Voiceover] Laid off. Fired. I mean, every time, you give us a different thing. - The guy asked me. Are you interested? Or are you just interested in you know, dragging me through the refuse of my life? I'm trying to you here is that I walked into that room balls on ready to get this fucking job okay. - [Voiceover] Balls on, man. - Now, listen. I come in there. And immediately, he goes "So, what computer programs "are you fluent on? "What computer programs done?" So, I said... Um, I've a... (phone ringing) Hyper. - [Voiceover] Hyper. What's hyper? - Card. Hyper card. And micro... Micro hard, and I have-- - Man, it's Microsoft. Well, alright, never mind. - That was your step in right there. You got your foot in the door. - Micro hard. It sounds like premature ejaculation or something. - [Voiceover] It's been awhile. I'm familiar with the program. - It should have been soft, but it-- - I told you it was Microsoft. I did that little thing where I had to fake it. - [Voiceover] Got the PC compatible. I'm done some work Mac. - I was faking it beautiful. Uh, Micro word. - Uh hmm. - And soft. Microsoft. - Why don't you tell me what it is you're looking for? (phone ringing) - You mean here? (guitar strumming) (sirens ringing) (folk music) - [Voiceover] How am I different than the people that comprise my generation? Well, you know, how different is anybody from anybody else? We all sort of want the same things, don't we? Oh, I'd like a roof over my head. I'd like a couple meals a day. A place to sleep. Meaningful conversation. (folk music) I don't want to be told that I have to commit to anything. I don't think anyone I know wants that dictated to them. I think that everybody is looking to find something to be committed to. But that word commitment, I keep seeing mental institutions. I have a problem with it. I think a lot of people do. I mean, it is a big word. It's got a lot of syllables. It's got that hard kind of sound at the end of it. You know, like a door slamming, commitment. (white noise) (car horn honking) I've had a few girlfriends in my day. I'm 29. I've gone out with a few different women. And I've had feelings of various kinds for them. I wouldn't say that I was committed to any of them, really in my heart. - Okay, here we go. Ready. Ah. (bottle opening) Whoah. - [Voiceover] Very good. You're spilling it. - [Woman] Thanks. (guitar strumming) - [Voiceover] Until we met. Let's sample one of my perks. That didn't bother me. - [Voiceover] Hmm. - [Voiceover] Every morning, there's a fresh bottle back there. - Oh yeah. - [Voiceover] It's tempting. (woman laughing) Let me tell you. - Oh, don't tell me you don't succumb. - [Voiceover] Well, you know, I've been cutting back on my drinking really. - Ah. - But I will have a little of that. So, what have you been doing? You know. I saw your picture in the paper a couple of times. - Yeah, well I mean, I've just been doing the same thing. You know. - I see your hats all over the place. - [Voiceover] Yeah? - Yeah. - [Voiceover] You do? Really? - Yeah. - [Voiceover] That's great. - It's kind of eerie really. To tell you the truth. - [Woman] Yeah. (woman laughing) - I tried to forget you, but I couldn't. (guitar strumming) But hey, we're hanging out now. - Yeah, this is great. - [Voiceover] Yeah. In style. (blues guitar music) (machine rejecting dollar) My favorite philosopher, and he's my favorite philosopher because nobody else know about him. He's very obscure, but he said something very interesting. "No one can observe another suffering for more than "15 minutes without feeling impatience." But if you look around, people in my generation, they're going to the bank on that suffering. Everybody's applauding it. Money is being made. - What's the deal with the camera? I mean, this whole thing. The film. Some ulterior motive maybe or? - [Voiceover] Very simple. I'm just making a documentary on the 20 something generation. Trying to figure out why they accuse us of being so cynical, so mired in adolescence, self pity, so apathetic. (rock music) (bar patrons talking loudly) - Listen to me Lyn, what you want to do is take that video camera. I mean, that's gotta be worth a couple of thousand bucks. Take that, and you sell it. And you can take care of all your problems. You can even pay your fucking bar bill, make Jerry happy. - I've seen it tear out my eyes, Bob. I'm not getting rid of the camera. The only thing I have. That's why I'm not getting rid of it, okay. - Where'd you get that anyhow? - It's a long story. I had a rent controlled apartment with my girlfriend. My girlfriend moved out, this guy wanted to move in. I said, "Okay, you can move in." I saw this camera that he had. Totally amateur okay. Didn't know what it was worth. I said, "You can have the apartment. "Just give me the camera." He did. End of story. I got the camera. I'm homeless. (water running) (flute organ music) I have every right to be a happy person. My upbringing couldn't have been more privileged. I lived in Connecticut. And the consciousness of privilege there was something that was very insidious. You knew. You knew damn well you were from Connecticut. And other people weren't. (train bell ringing) You don't know that there's anything wrong with perfection until you've lived in Connecticut, okay. It's like a bland slow-acting poison really. My family. On the surface, perfect. Everyone should have been happy. But that's a pretty overwhelming cross to bear in itself. A lot of people snapped. You didn't hear about it of course. I was kind of a strange kid. In that I liked to just look at things. Often times, I would sit and just stare at say like a tree or something. My parents, they were a little concerned. They thought I was strange. They thought there might be something wrong with me. (drumming) For the longest time, I really didn't know what to do. Picking up a camera now seems logical. - The 60s and 50s generation. And the 70s too. Judging us and saying we're losers (laughing) when in fact what we're doing is just trying to find simple meaningfulness and happiness in our lives.. Is that asking too much? I don't know. (drumming) - I don't think I'm gonna make it in the Boston music scene. (jazz music) - I hate to be harsh, but man, you gotta come up with a different beat. We're almost out. Who's going? Huh? - Well, you go, and I pay. That's cool, right? - It would be cool. Except it's Sunday. And we're in Massachusetts, which means the liquor stores are closed. (sighing) I'm getting the fuck out of here. - Oh yeah. Where you gonna go? - I tell you where I'm gonna go. (paper rustling) Check it out. - (sniffing) S. America's Patagonia. Where the fuck is Patagonia? - The tip of South America. Endless vistas of pure beauty. What I'm looking for down there is gonna change my life. Called a Miladon. That's the scientific name for it. It's a giant sloth and I know they exist, because they wouldn't have a scientific name for it if it didn't. It's my meal ticket. If I get some footage of this thing, I'm made. I'm gonna find it down there. But the best thing. I'll tell you what the best thing is. (closing bottle) No people. - No people? That's probably a good place for me to practice. (blues music) - [Voiceover] What can be worse than living in the past? My generation, we just keep borrowing things from the past. We seem to be obsessed with the recycling the past. Of trying to attach some positive value to it. Nostalgia's cool. You know. Let's bring back the 70s, let's bring back the 80s, let's bring back the 90s. Let's bring back the middle ages. I don't know what's next, but it's all a cover up, because what we're really covering up is the fact that something went wrong in the past. And we're going back there to try and fix it. That's what I think. - [Voiceover] Hey you know, Bulge is looking for you. You never gave him last month's rent. - He's got my security deposit. This is my map right? - [Voiceover] Well, it's in your own fucking room, isn't it? - What times your show tonight? - It's eight o'clock as usual. Gonna be there? - Yeah, bringing my boyfriend. (man laughing) He loves that stuff. - [Voiceover] Oh great. (woman laughing) How's it looking? (tearing map) Hang on. Hey Lyn, did you get a job yet? - [Voiceover] Yeah. - Shh, shh, shh. Oh, good, good. How's your girlfriend (laughing)? - Yeah, she's great. Sends her love. - [Voiceover] So, are you still living with her? - Yeah. - [Voiceover] Then how come I still keep getting your mail and your phone messages here? - Did you get anything from the unemployment office? - I thought you said you had a job, Lyn? (blues music) - [Voiceover] 19 years is a long time to have absolutely no communication with your father. And I was quite used to thinking him gone. And then the letters, started coming to me. My father is a person who, once he turns it on. Once he wants something from you, he won't stop, until he gets it. And as soon as he gets it, he'll stop. This is impossible. It says my father called here. - [Voiceover] Your father did call. - It's your dad. It's gotta be your dad. It can't be my dad. He wouldn't call here. - [Voiceover] Lyn, it was your father. He called. He called about a month ago. Along with your mother and your sister. And you know, a lot of creditors too. When the fuck are you gonna take care of this stuff? I'm getting really sick of playing phone machine to you. You know what I mean, pal? You're an adult. Why don't you take care of this stuff, you know? I mean, you moved out three months ago. For Christ sake, deal with it. Won't you? - Turned into a real bitch, Bob. (siren ringing) (blues guitar music) I guess, when I think about my father leaving California, having amassed a fortune in real estate apparently, at least that's what I heard, then, coming back to Connecticut to flaunt himself there, it's what else is it? But a criminal leaving the scene of the crime, and coming back with the golden goose, and saying, "Look, it's all okay. It's all normal again." (reggae music) And sometimes I don't want to think about my past and about my family. Because of just how normal it seemed. It's absurd. (man laughing) - [Woman] What's it about? - Uh, you know. It's the generational kind of type of documentary that a lot of people seem to be making now. Except mines gonna be different. - What? Are you talking about a Slacker film? - I'm talking about ripping away that label. I'm talking about finding the wound. (man laughing) - [Voiceover] The wound? - Yeah. The wound underneath. When you rip the label off, and the scab comes off, there's a wound. - If you want to know what the wound is, the wound is divorce. I mean, that's basically what our generation-- - Wait a second. - I mean, what our generation is born by is divorce. - I like this. - I would say about 70% of people our age is from divorced families. I mean, there's three in my family. I mean, it's fucked me up. And they probably should have gotten divorced four years earlier than they did, but I know that defines what kind of person I am. And probably what kind of person half my friends are. - Yeah. - [Voiceover] Blame it on someone else. - No, it's not. - That pre-ironic glib, you know. - Oh, please. We're just the first generation to have the lame cop out. You know. Lost Generation World War I, the Beat Generation World War II. We don't even have Vietnam. So, what do we look for? We look for divorce. Oh, I was torn to sunder, I got no faith in the future. - [Woman] Divorce has affected us. - This is the perfect example of what I'm talking about. We have someone here dealing sincerely with something openly and everyone's rushing to like seal up the wound. To seal the wound. - [Voiceover] Is this pre-ironic, or post ironic? - I want to see the wound. I want it ripped it open. That's what this is for. - [Voiceover] This is like your therapy or something. - It's not therapy. - [Voiceover] I mean, has anybody interviewed you? - No. I'm not interested me. - Well, it seems like it's a reflection from your problems, from your life as well. Trying to find out how other people deal with them is sort of like therapy. - I'm not selling my problem to anybody. I'm dealing with it. You know. - [Voiceover] You're dealing with it. Yeah, you won't admit that it's like part of you. (sniffing) - [Voiceover] You're in denial. - I'm in denial. It's not a 12-step, co-dependent, whatever the term is. You know. Rip those labels away, okay. Just deal with the naked open wound. Okay. That's all I'm saying here. - [Voiceover] The wound. - It hurts man. Nobody asked me. It just freaked me out. I was having a nice dream, and then, just bam. And some guys hitting me. It was bad. - Every generation has to pick up the slack for... They have to clean up the mess that the generation before them left. - I don't know how many letters I got, but I never did read them. I didn't thrown them away. But I didn't read them. (water dripping) when I was very young, like said before the divorce, cause I really divide everything before and after, I worshiped my father. He was everything to me. Because when he was on, he was a lot of fun. He always brought out a feeling of adventure. He used to always take us on trips. It seemed that he was always up on those trips too. - [Voiceover] Where are we headed? - [Voiceover] Better keep that down. - [Voiceover] Oh. - [Voiceover] I'm working on it for a little scream. - It's a surprise? - [Voiceover] Of course. - Cool. I feel like it's been years since I've seen you. You've changed, so much. - [Voiceover] It takes a little while to get your shit together. You just can't snap your fingers and... - Yeah, like a year. - [Voiceover] Yeah. (woman laughing) Some people, it takes longer than other people. You know. Right about here, and I picked up the Pan American Highway. - [Voiceover] That's it. That's what you were saying last night. - Yeah, I know. Just followed it right straight down. Right through Mexico. - [Voiceover] Okay. - Yucatan, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and then Panama, and then right, keep going right through Panama, and then boom, right there. Stops dead. Stops man. - Nah, it goes on. It goes all the way down. That's what you said last night. - You can't pick it back up down here, but you gotta understand there's 80 miles of swamp man. 80 miles of swamp. - Okay. - It's called the Darien Gap. Darien Gap. 80 miles of swamp. - Darien Gap. - Ugliest swamp you've ever seen dude. - It's not on the map. - Of course it's not on the map. Why would it be on the map? I don't think you understand. You see. - Well, it's a thing isn't it? - Well, look. Okay. You gotta understand what's going, alright. There's 80 miles. There's no highway. It's for a reason. - So, what's the reason. - That's what I'm getting to. The reason is right, okay the official story is Noriega didn't want the Columbians to come up into Panama. You know, the drug trade and stuff. But it ain't about that at all. And what it really has to do with, right, is the CIA. And Nazi collaborators. - Wait, wait. The CIA-- - Yeah, yeah. What they've done is they've coerced a group of local shamans, okay, into giving them the secret of the zombie formula. You know the stuff in Haiti. You remember that story? (man laughing) Yeah, what they're doing right, is they're manufacturing an army about 100,000 zombies man, that can work 24 hours around the clock dude. You know, they're gonna send them to the moon man. - Oh, I get it. It's lunacy. The Moon, lunacy right? Listen. Suppose I'm able to get past the Nazis and the shamans, and the Shriners, and whoever else is down there in the gap. Okay. Suppose I just get past all those people. I mean, it would be possible for me to get past them, wouldn't it? - Well, you could take a boat. - No, I get vomit if it's on the ocean. - Alright, well, you can fly. - I'm not funded. - Too expensive. - What if I walked? Could I walk through? - Dude, man. You can't walk, man. Look. There are leaches seven feet long, you know. Like suck the blood right out of you man. I mean, if the zombies don't get you, the leaches will. You don't want to go down there dude. - Patagonia. You know what's down there? - No. - Sloths. (flute music) You know what kind of sloths? - No. - Giant sloths. - How big? - 20 feet. - Does that include the tail? (lighting cigarette) - [Voiceover] When ever there was a problem, um, my father's reaction to it would be, "Let's just go somewhere." I remember him saying that to my mother. "Let's just go somewhere." And he started ticking off the places we could go. He was always like that. Taking the summer, went to the islands, the Caribbean, Spain, Hong Kong one time. I think it was his way of driving us altogether, sort of. Well, we can't go anywhere. It was a way of sequestering us in this foreign land or something, so that he could keep us, you know, altogether. - [Voiceover] Every yeah I hear like, I'm out of here man. Boston's history. I'm on the road, you know. (men laughing) Where are you? You sitting on a god damn couch. - [Man In Hat] This is a one man Nation Geographic special. - I'll send y'all a postcard. - [Voiceover] The white tigers of the butane. - I'm going. I'm gonna take my thumb out and I'm gonna go. - [Voiceover] Whoah. Hey. - All the fucking way down to Patagonia. I'm gonna take my camera. - [Voiceover] The Pan American highway? - You don't even have a license. - [Voiceover] You can't pass a job interview. How you gonna get through customs? - If you know where you're going, you know what you're doing man, the obstacles fall away. (men laughing) Oh, I know you think that's cosmic. And you guys are all so grounded. You guys are so grounded. You're like six feet under man. I'm going, all the way straight down. (man laughing) You guys can fall off your bar stools, I don't give a fuck. (folk music) (bag hitting ground) (cans crashing) (car honking) (cars driving by) Right after they had separated, we were with my mother of course, and I did runaway. I got about, oh I don't know, a few miles down the road. I slept in a box. A little cardboard box. I guess I was in training for my future or something. But the funny thing is you know, beginners luck, I found ten bucks in a pair of wool pants. I ran back, I was so excited, I wanted to tell her about it. (laughing) That was what was so strange. When bad things happened, then good things would happen. Now, I look at my life. And, maybe that's why I can endure the poverty, the confusion of my life. Cause I think something good's gonna happen. (car driving by) - [Voiceover] Bryan's actually a poet. - [Voiceover] Cool. - [Voiceover] Yeah. - [Voiceover] Give us a riff, come on. - [Voiceover] On the spot, right now come on. - Give us a little verse in honor of Lyn's little naval gazing documentary. Tell us about ourselves. (woman laughing) - Poetry is when you take your clothes off, but your voice is on. [Voiceover] I see. - Poetry is the love affair of your language. Poetry is our birth. Poetry is our Earth. Poetry is when we are what we are. The becoming of ourselves in our ex-ness. Out of our us-ness, into the kiss of our youth. (snapping fingers) This is the kiss generation. (man and women laughing) Gen X you are. Muah. Love you baby. (folk music) (party people talking loudly) - So, what is this for? - [Voiceover] What is it for? - Yeah. - [Voiceover] Does it have to be for something? - Or it's like a prop? You just take it a party-- - (laughing) Are you trying to pick up girls with it? - [Voiceover] No, really. Turn it off. - [Voiceover] It's not off. - [Voiceover] Alright, it's off. - [Voiceover] It's not off. - We design our own clothes. - [Voiceover] Really? - Yeah, really. - Yeah, I design the hats and the clothes. Immortal Coil hats by Polly Joy. - [Voiceover] That's your real name? Polly Joy. - Yeah. - [Voiceover] Yes, it's her real name. - [Voiceover] Really? - Uh hmm. - [Voiceover] You sound like a stripper. Nah, I'm just kidding. - [Voiceover] It's not off. - [Voiceover] Yeah, it's off. - [Voiceover] It's not off. And there's something you put on, to go out into the world. Sort of like your mask. They're like your image. But they're important. I mean, that's the first thing someone sees is your clothes. And they judge you. First impressions are everything, right? - [Voiceover] Right. - Hey you know you remind me of? - [Voiceover] No. - Henry Miller. - You mean that short little Simian bald guy running around? - No, not the way you look. - With holes in his shoes. - It's sort of, your like romantic cynicism. - I'm unemployed. I'm homeless and I have no resources. And I'm the happiest man alive. - You're homeless? - That's Henry Miller, it's Tropic of Cancer. It's the beginning. - Of course, yeah. - You know, you kind of remind me of Anais Nin to tell you the truth. - Really? - They had a thing, you know. - [Voiceover] Why do I remind you of Anais Nin? - Because you're beautiful. And because you make me feel like a little Simian, balding guy. (woman laughing) On the make. - I didn't know I had. - This thing. I mean, if you threw it down the stairs, would it follow you like a slinky or something? (jazz piano music) - So, what do you do besides make documentaries? - Um... - How come you never look at me when you talk to me? I noticed that earlier. You never look at people. - Well, I think I told you why, because I'm shy. - [Voiceover] Last call. - (laughing) You're not shy. - No, I am. I really am shy. - [Voiceover] Let's go folks. I gotta get out of here. - [Voiceover] Um, yeah. - I guess we kind of have to go. - Yeah, I better be getting home anyway. - Listen. Let me walk you. I mean, it's late. - Okay, sure. - Cool. (woman clearing through) - I guess we gotta pay our tab huh. - [Voiceover] Oh, yeah, I'll get it. - [Voiceover] Hang on. - [Voiceover] No, I'll get it. - [Voiceover] No, hang on. - [Voiceover] No, really, I'll get it. Don't worry about it. You get it-- - Yeah, really. - [Voiceover] You can get it next time. - Yeah, I know I had some more money. (jazz music) Well, I can't figure out where one of these things starts, stops, and the other one starts. Hey, wait, a second. That's you. (woman laughing) (kissing) Oh, wow. (woman laughing) You're more beautiful than I imagine. (woman and man laughing) (punk music) (train riding by) (jazz music) It sounds cruel, but I don't believe my father really did love my mother when they got married. I think he married her for the money. He was a bit of a playboy. You know what I mean, he was an actor and had that going on. Actors tend to have that narcissistic approach to life. My mom was a very giving person, and a very maternal woman, there's no other way to say it. And I think that as bad as it she viewed my father as one of her children almost. She thought she could change him. Being able to change my father was a great challenge for her. Good morning. - Good morning. - The total distance from Laredo, Texas to Bueno Aires by way of the Pan American Highway is 11,360 miles. It's like halfway to the moon. - Man, look at this. Isn't that beautiful? - Oh, yeah, it's the Absinthe Drinkers by Degas. - [Voiceover] Do you think she looks happy or sad? - [Voiceover] She looks kind of blitzed out to me. - [Voiceover] I think she looks sad. - I know where we can get some absinthe. - Absinthe, really? - Shh. It's illegal. - Well, where can you get it? - I know a guy who knows a guy. - Well, get some. - It'll fuck you up. - I wanna be fucked up. - Great, how much? - 895. $895. - What? - Cause that's what it's gonna cost for a ticket to Spain. And that's the only place you're gonna get it legally today. - That's why I'm talking to you man, because you get stuff that's illegal. - Right, that's what I do. But nowadays, there's no demand for it. It's extinct. Passe. - You know, I gotta come through here. This is a love thing. - Give her some Ouzo. (Lyn sighing) It's clear, it's smells right. She'll never know. - Okay. (jazz music) - It's not as green as it is in the pictures. - Those artistic license, probably never was that green. Pour the absinthe into the sugar. A little water. So it can cloud up. See. - Okay, let's tell each other one secret. Just one thing we've never told each other before. Right before we drink. You know, in case we die. - Yeah, sure. - Okay. Okay, so it can't be trivial though. It has to be a real secret. - Important stuff. - Right. Are you ready? - [Lyn] Okay. Yup. - Okay, go. I'm not 28, I'm only 22. - I'm homeless. (woman laughing) - What do you mean homeless? - Technically, I'm homeless. - How do you... I mean where do you sleep? How do you survive? Where do you eat? - Do the words Hare Hare, Rama Rama mean anything to you? - You are not a Hare Krishna. - No, I'm not a Hare Krishna. I just eat there sometimes. - You know, it's free. - Well, why did you tell me you had a loft? - Why did you say you were 28. - Because I thought it would make a difference. - Does it? - No. I guess it doesn't make a difference. I mean, no. Of course it doesn't. Let's just from now on, be totally honest with each other. Okay. - Absolutely. (jazz music) - This absinthe's really good. - You like it? - Yeah. Oh my god. - [Voiceover] I find that it's really hard to tell the truth all the time. Here it is. There's no place like home. They're just little lies that seem so necessary when you're in love. - You want me to leave? (piano music) - [Voiceover] That was the think about my father. My mother would accuse him of lying. I think it has something to do with the fact that his training as an actor. She couldn't really tell where he was being genuine sometimes, and where he was exaggerating for effect. I hope that wasn't too shocking for you. I know down there. There's like-- - [Woman] So what. - Airborne bacteria I feel like there's - [Woman] Yeah. spores lodging my lungs. Sometimes I just wish I could get a hot shower right now. (piano music) - Yeah. (man sighing) - I'm getting tired of living down there I think. I don't know. Down there too long. - Okay, Lyn, you can stay with me. Just for a little while. You can't move in or anything. You can just stay there for awhile. - No. You don't have to do that. - It's not like it's gonna be... We see each other everyday anyway, so it's not like it's gonna be any different. - We do see each other everyday. That's true. I mean it wouldn't be different. You don't have to do that though. - It's no problem. It's not like it's permanent or anything. - It'll be fun, you know. - Yeah. - I'm real good. I do the dishes and all that. - You don't have to go there. - Let's celebrate. (woman laughing) - Isn't it a little early for Jim Beam? - Would Anais Nin say to Henry Miller it's too early? It's never too early. - It's never too early to celebrate huh? - Just try a little. (coughing) (kissing) You happy? - Yeah. - I'm happy. - Good. (jazz music) (car driving by) - Here we are. - [Voiceover] Cool. (door closing) So, where's the beach? - It's out there. How come we never did this before? We never even left the apartment, let alone go to the beach. - I liked the apartment. You were in it. Besides, not like I had never suggested that we go anywhere. You were just always busy. - Yeah, well Patagonia is a little bit further from the beach. - Want a cigarette? - I quit. - Bullshit. - I really quit. - You quit smoking? - Lyn Voss right? - That's me. You can change. (train riding by) (rock music) I'd rather not get hired than get fired though. - You don't have a job yet. - I'd rather get fired than hired. Cause then you get the unemployment. - You don't have any economic stability. You don't have any health insurance. You haven't for five or six years. You don't have any real goals in life. What do you do? You get credit card, one thing, and then you go into something else. - [Voiceover] I'm glad you two can leave something. - You somebody, you're just like, ah, I got to be with this person. And you're with them all the time. And you're just like, "This is so cool, "I feel so great, I'm happy, I have a meaning in life." And then eventually, it just kind of like fades. (rock music) - [Voiceover] I guess he wasn't really making any money. That was part of it. He always resented the fact that he was not a good actor. And I think that's what contributed to the tension in our house. Any display of anger from my mother would immediately drive him into a shell. That's the funny thing about it. Him being an actor and all of a sudden, being Mr. Kabuki, silent man in the corner. - We're not gonna have Ozzie and Harriet again. Something like it maybe, but it'll be different. You know, it'll be fucked up in its own special way. (door opening) - Hey. What's up? Oh not much Polly. How was the reception? Oh, the reception was great. The stuff's pretty good, but not as good as mine though. But I stole a bottle of wine from the reception table. (placing bottle on counter) Lyn, this bottle was full this morning. - Thanks. How was the reception? - I just told you. What's this? - Just another interview. - What do really say is real true? It's like our pain, or it's like our feelings of loss. You know, if anything, everyone I know, has a fucked up relationship with someone who should he intimately important to them. You know. Everyone has a fundamental feeling of loss. Everyone has some kind of pain that they have to come to terms with. - Goddammit Lyn. You know this fucking documentary is not paying the fucking bills. And I don't know why I have to come back here and ask everyday, "Have you gotten a job yet?" Sit around this apartment, my apartment, like an idiot, moaning about the fucking state of the damn generation. (blues music) - [Voiceover] One time, I remember one time, one particular frantic time, my father and my mother had... He had just come back from New York and immediately they had a big blew up. And for three days, he'd sat there doing nothing pretty much. And then all of a sudden, he jumped and said, "We're going to Disney World." Well, that's a fucking kid's paradise isn't it. But I think by the that point, we were on to them. It wasn't a very fun trip. And when you go to Disney World as a kid, and you don't have fun, you know something's wrong. (punk music) (woman laughing) (reggae music) - Oh, um. Lyn. It is Lyn right? - [Voiceover] Yeah. - What is your opinion on the fashion industry? - Well, I like what Oscar Wilde said. Fashion. It's so awful, you have to change it every six months. (women laughing) - Don't you think Lyn should cut his hair. I keep telling him. I think he would look so much better with it short. - [Blonde Woman] Definitely. - Yeah, and you'd look a lot better if you didn't wear a wig. - You're wearing a wig? - Yeah, you didn't know? - [Voiceover] Take it off Polly. - Definitely take it off. (women laughing) (clapping) - [Voiceover] Oh my god. Great. I knew that was a wig. Nice. It's you, it's really you, Polly. - [Voiceover] It's great. - You know, I feel like your pet. I feel like your friends are looking at me and going, "Oh, he's the little dog until the big dog comes around." - At least you can try and fit in a little bit more. You know, you can at least try to be polite. At least look like you're having a good time. - You're just mad because I brought up the thing about the wig. Okay. - [Polly] No, I'm not. - Everybody knows you were a wig. - [Voiceover] I don't care about the wig. I know they all know Janet was the only one who didn't know I have a wig. - What do you wear it for anyway? Everyday. I mean, are you hiding something? Why do you have to wear it everyday? - [Polly] No, I'm not hiding anything. What are you hiding? You know, in your little cigar box? What do you have to hide, Lyn? - You haven't looked in there, have you? - No, I haven't looked in there. - That's private. Okay? - I don't pry into your secret life, Lyn. Or whatever life you have. I mean, you don't have a job. Don't even have a place to live. - You get pretty nasty when you get mad don't you? - Yes, I get pretty nasty. I mean, Lyn, I thought we were gonna be honest with each other from now on? - We are being honest with each other. (Polly sighing) That's the problem. (siren ringing) (punk music) (bird squalling) - Come on. - [Voiceover] Have I learned from my parent's mistakes? What I've learned is that you can't trust your feelings if you can't communicate them. No matter how much you may feel for somebody else, you have to show it. And I don't think that my father was able to show it. Not that he didn't try sometimes. - They pigeon hole us as a generation that's unable to find commitment in anything. Jobs. You know, our careers, and relationships, you know. And I feel that like, for instance, you two guys. I mean, you guys know what I'm talking about because you've been seeing each other for like what, a year now or something? - Six months. - [Voiceover] Five months. - Whatever. I don't even know what people mean by fucking commitment. I mean, it used to mean, like I don't know, some sort of idea of fidelity, but let's admit it. At any time, in any relationship, one of the two people is thinking about something or someone else. So. - [Voiceover] Absolutely. - You can't really talk about fidelity. The most, in terms of fidelity, commitment means just like if I cheat on you, it's only gonna be for one night, and it won't mean anything, and I won't tell you about it because I don't wanna hurt your feelings. - You cheat on me one night, you're not gonna tell me about it? - It's just an example. - Yeah, but you sound like you're talking from experience. - I'm just saying commitment doesn't mean anything, so it's meaningless to believe in it. - [Voiceover] I agree, absolutely. - I think everyone dabble in stuff that I think you know, that everyone has someone that's out there for them, and that commitment means a lot. I think it's an important step in a relationship. Instead of just fucking around. - [Man In White Shirt] Without commitment, what else is there? - Well, commitment usually means you better make a lot of money. - You've got sex, you've got love. - [Voiceover] You can have a loving relationship without a real sense of commitment. - [Voiceover] We're loving. And I could fuck you tonight and Dan wouldn't mind at all, right honey? - [Voiceover] As long as you didn't tell me. - [Voiceover] Right, see. (man laughing) - [Voiceover] There's a little bitterness there. - I mean, when most people talk about stability, they don't mean emotional or character stability, they mean does he have a steady and regular paycheck, and can I dip into it whenever I want. - I would hope that our relationship is a lot more stable than your paycheck. - [Voiceover] How about you guys? We haven't heard a single peep out of you. What's going on with you guys? - We're just benefiting from the sage council that I'm hearing here. Right? - [Voiceover] How about you Polly? - She's the silent partner. - [Polly] I agree. - The silent, strong, silent waters run deep. She's running deep now. Real deep. Too deep. - [Woman On TV] I think women tend to show that we're more emotive, and expressive in saying, you know, and all these password. I don't know. Just seeing my male friends every once in awhile, I'll go, I know, something's bothering me. Something's eating away at me, or whatever. It's like your depressed. You know, you don't know what you're doing with your life. We all don't. We're all in this together. And yeah, I think a lot of people really feel that way. (birds chirping) (folk music) - [Voiceover] They had had a fight of course. This time in Spain. My mother freaked out cause she wanted to back, and he wanted to just keep going. I mean, he probably would have circled the world if she had let him. And she took our suitcases and threw them off the 13th floor of the Barcelona Hilton. I think that's why she threw it out the window really. Because of course, you know, he wasn't paying for this trip. He never had any money. He was just an actor. (loud foot steps) That was the last trip that we took. After that, it was splitsville for them. (paper crumpling) (siren ringing) (steel guitar playing) - Don't move. - Um. I have an idea. - Um, yeah. What? Getting a job. - Nothing that mundane. I was thinking we could take a trip. - [Voiceover] Like the Cape or something. - Yeah, we can go to the Cape, but I was thinking more like Buenos Aires. - [Voiceover] Buenos Aires? - You know, they do have a fashion scene down there. - Oh yeah, well, okay. Let me just finish this alteration and I'll call my travel agent and couple of tickets for a couple thousand dollars. Or we could buy a car, (sniffling) drive down, oh no, we can't do that, cause there's the swamp, the gap thing. What's it called? - The Darien Gap. (sighing) Look, I could sell my camera. - How would you finish your documentary? - It's not the end that would be all of my existence. - I mean, what is important to you? Obviously, your documentary isn't important to you. Getting your shit together isn't important. Getting a job isn't important. - [Voiceover] It's hard to get a job when you're making a documentary. - I thought you said the documentary wasn't important. - It is important. It's... Something things are just more important. That's all. (folk music) - Lyn, selling your camera for a couple of thousand isn't gonna change my mind. - Change your mind? What's that supposed to mean? - Lyn, I just can't take off. I have a show to do next week. - You're 22. It's all career with you. - Lyn, my career happens to be important to me. You know, it happens to matter. - That's just it. No sacrifices for a little real living. It's all career. Lock in. - Sacrifice? Sacrifice? Lyn, I sacrifice my independence by fucking letting you move in here. (jar breaking) God dammit. - Sacrifice your independence. - Lyn, would you get in here and help me clean this up? - Coming. - What are you doing? We can't eat that. There's glass in there. - I paid for it. You didn't pay for it, did you? - Well, because it's been paid for, we have to bleed to death? - Yes. - Why don't we go out and eat? - Are you gonna pay for it? - Look, if we take a little bit of glass, and we put it into the meal about a third of the way through, you get a free meal, it works. - Great, Lyn. - How about the Krishnans? You wanna go there? - I will never eat at the Hare Krishna again. (sighing) Lyn, I want you to move out. I can't support you, Lyn. - How much? Yours? - Yeah, it's mine. - 250. - $250? - Yeah. - $250? - 250. - No, thanks. (punk music) (loud foot steps) - Oh, hey Polly. I got the rent money. It's all here. - You have the key, why didn't you just let yourself in? - Cause, you know, you were so mad, and I didn't feel-- - You didn't feel welcome. - I'll be around tomorrow. Just come back then to get yourself. (sighing) (folk music) - Fuck. This is my train. - This is your train? - This is my train. You gotta get another car. - Excuse me, I can't smell your territorial scent droppings. There's a lot of other odors. - [Voiceover] Fuck, fuck you. (patting down seat) - [Voiceover] I guess if you look at my mother and my father, it's that old saying, you know. You don't miss your water till the well runs dry. And maybe that explains the great torrent of emotion, all the letters that he sent her after they were separated. All of that, but too late. It all came too late. (rock music) - Hey, Lyn man, Hey, Lyn. Whoah. Hey, how you doing? I haven't seen you for awhile man. Got the camera still. What's going on? Check me out, I'm rollerblading. I get the new job. I already told you that. I get a new apartment and it's rent controlled. I'm making more money that I used to make, and I'm paying less rent. I don't mean to keep going on about myself, but I mean. Geez, let me see if I told you everything. The girlfriend that blew me off, when I used to hand out with you guys and I was miserable, she calls me up. And she things she's made a mistake. (laughing) Made a mistake? Definitely. Check these out man. And I'm healthier now than when I was when I used to hang out with you guys drinking beers. I don't even need the healthcare. Anyway, things couldn't be going better. But what have you been doing? Anyway, uh, listen actually, you know, I should get going, Lyn, cause I'm busy. I wanna give you an extra key to my apartment, okay. Just as a thought, you know, if you wanna come by, take a shower, here's an extra key. That's an extra one. There's a blue towel on the backdoor. Use that, okay? Okay, look. Leave you 20. Keep the change. And we'll see you. Come by the place. Really, I mean it, okay. And take care of yourself, alright. We'll just be moving along here. Just good seeing you. Okay, lot of new stuff. See you, Lyn. (exhaling) (lounge music) (woman laughing) (drink pouring) - [Voiceover] I wasn't aware of it then, but you can really say that my father used us kids as bargaining chips. Pawns in a game, between he and my mother. That he loved her so much, again when it was too late. That he would be willing to use us. - Do you have a light? Light? Light? Thanks. Thanks. - I like your hat. - Oh, thanks, I got it at a hat designer downtown. - I like how it towers up like the Tower of Babel in a spiral. - You like that? - Yeah. - Try to be different. - [Voiceover] This was about two or three weeks after they had separated, he showed up at our school, when my sister and I were leaving. And he bundled us off into the car, and we went back to his apartment. He said we were going to go on a trip. By then, we were expecting that. Oh good, we're gonna go on another trip, everything must be normal again. But we never did go anywhere. We stayed in his apartment for a couple of days. He let use do everything a kid would want to do. We ate candy and stayed up until three in the morning. You know, we just had the best time that we ever had. But the strangest thing about that particular incident was that my mother had absolutely no idea where we were for two entire days. I mean, there was a police report filed. Not that it made the paper of anything. This was Connecticut after all. This stuff is very hush hush, you know, in Connecticut. Now, she was devastated of course. (cars driving by) There was no further communication between them. And he left. (phone ringing) - Hello? Lyn? (siren ringing) (cars driving by) - [Voiceover] My father ran away from his commitment to us for some reason. And as much as I'd like to hate him for that reason, uh, I got to look at it as being a career decision. - Hey. Hey. My world your ashtray jackass? Let's go, get a move on it. (beep) - [Voiceover] Yes. - Yeah, limo here for Dunleavy. - [Voiceover] Be right down. - Yeah, right. (car closing) (car starting) (car screeching off) Fuck. (screaming) Fuck. (car horn honking) (alternative music) (closing compartment door) - Polly, hi. - Your tapes. You never came to get them. - Actually, these are for you. - Look at you. God. - Normal enough for you? That's what happens when you're working. - God, I hardly recognized you. - (sighing) Listen. I'd like us to go for a spin. Let's just go. Me and you, just for fun. For old times sake. - Can you do that? - Yeah, I can do that. My boss loves me and lets me have the limo on the weekends. It's no problem. Really. - I don't know, Lyn. - Come on. It'll be fun. (alternative music) (birds squalling) (waves whooshing) - You know, just as the suns, drops below the horizon, you can see this green flash. It's only there for a millisecond. Some people never even see it. - But you've seen it. (bird squalling) - Yeah. - [Voiceover] Well, you make a wish for something? - [Voiceover] No, no, it's a phenomenon. - Well, if it's a phenomenon, you should make a wish. - Okay, okay. We'll make a wish. - You got one? - Uh, yeah, yeah I got a wish. Okay, ready, here it goes. - Uh hmm. - That's it. Did you see it? - No, I missed it. - Lyn. - I was looking at you. - Well, what did you wish. - It doesn't matter, I was looking at you. - Let's get totally drunk. - Okay. - With some red wine? - Sure. - [Voiceover] You're okay to drive. - Yeah, I'm a driver. (door closing) (low bass playing) - Lyn, I just realized I don't have any cash on me. You don't mind do you? - Yeah, I'm working. Go and get yourself something you want. I'll be there in a second, okay. I just gotta get my wallet huh. - Okay, cool. (grunge music) - No, no, no. We want to get something expensive. This is cheap stuff, we're splurging. - (laughing) Okay. - Go back and get some really expensive stuff. And remember, even years are the good years. Odd years. - Even years. Okay got it. - Maybe it's the other way around, I don't know. - Hi. I'd like some Jim Beam if you could stir yourself from that book there buddy. Grab be a half pint. Thanks. - That'll be $3.79 please. I'd like to see your ID. - Do I look like a student to you? Look, I'm 30. Okay. - Congratulations. Can I see your ID please? - Yeah. - Who taught you how to hold a gun? - Don't get wise with me motherfucker. Just give me the money, okay. - Alright, alright. - I want 50, now. - [Voiceover] Fine. (money crumpling) - Alright, alright. Don't card me when she comes back, alright. - [Voiceover] Yes sir. - We got (speaks in foreign language). - Oh, it's great. I love this. How much is that gonna be? - Um. That'll be $24 please. - 20. 10. 30. This is for you for being so helpful. Really do appreciate it. - Thank you. (bottles clanking) Good night. (bell ringing) Fuck. - I miss you so much. - [Voiceover] Yeah. - Yeah. I just, I think I lost it. Well, it's been quite a while since we've seen each other. Have you been seeing anybody? Have you? - No. When would I have time to see anybody? I've been working. - [Voiceover] I'm going nuts right now. I'm telling you. I think I'm... Give me some of that wine, would you? Jesus, you're such a pig. It's like when you're driving... It's a shock absorber basically. To me, that's what the fucking thing is. It's a shock absorber. - I might have some hope to get loved, yeah. - [Voiceover] Naked and serious direction. I'm bordering on a major, like a zen realization or something. - That's right. (tapping box) Generation X. This is evident against my initial enthusiasm for the subject. I'm not interested anymore. I've exhausted my interest in these people. Don't touch my tapes. Look here, these people are in pain. Don't you understand? They have to be handled colorfully. I'm part of the whole media trip. The invasion of privacy. That's it. Don't you understand? The information superhighway is a surveillance system. - [Voiceover] Yeah, so what? - Who cares. Who cares. - I bet you-- - [Voiceover] You don't think I'm a good driver, is that it? - You stole this limo from, some Italian mafia guy. - [Voiceover] You got an overactive imagination lady. Yeah, that's right. You got it alright. Boy. How'd you figure that out? - Oh, Lyn, I know you too well. (Lyn laughing) - I gotta take a little wee wee. - Oh. Here, let me get you some film here. Okay, here I come. Okay, start pissing. - Hey, I'm gonna over there by the high chair. - [Voiceover] Lyn, this thing isn't working> - The batteries are dead. - [Voiceover] Man. (waves crashing) - Lyn, you know I have a life. Ouh, I have got to work in the morning. (crickets chirping) I've got a show. I've like got to sew things. (door opening) Lyn (laughing). What are you doing? (laughing) - I've got something to tell you. - (laughing) I don't wanna hear it. (waves crashing) (folk music) (window rolling down) Um. (sniffling) Where are we? - We're in a gas station. - Obviously. - This doesn't look like Boston. (open door opening) Ah, fuck. - Thank you. - What town are we in? - [Voiceover] Stony Creek. - Massachusetts? - No, Connecticut. - Lyn. (folk music) Jesus, what is going on? - Mr. Deangelo. Mr. Deangelo. You forgot your card. - Thanks. (car driving off) (folk guitar) - Deangelo? Who the hell is Mr. Deangelo, Lyn? Lyn, what's going on here? Why are we in Connecticut? - We're taking a little trip. - Lyn, where did you get this car? - I borrowed it. - You stole it. - Borrowed it sounds nicer. - You stole this limousine? - Don't make it so dramatic? - Lyn, I'm an accessory probably. - Don't worry. We'll ditch the car at the border. - Border? Mexico? You think I'm coming with you? I'm not coming with you, Lyn. - Come on. Just give me a chance. Let's go a little further. Come on. - [Polly] Lyn, stop the car. Just stop the fucking car, Lyn. - We can't. Don't you realize that they're looking for me? - Lyn, I thought you said no one saw you take the limo. - We don't know that. - Okay, look. Let's not get paranoid here. Okay, let's just-- - Paranoid? - Stop and think clearly for a minute. (gasping) Okay, now just tell me straight. Did anyone see you take the limo? - I don't know. - Yes or no, Lyn? - I don't think so. - Okay, okay. Then if no one saw you take the limo. We'll ditch it here and we'll take a train back to Boston. And we'll wipe our fingerprints off the inside of the limo. I mean, if no one saw you take it, then they'll just think some high school kids took it for a joy ride or something. They'll never connect it with you. I mean, do you have any money. - I can't go back to Boston. - You can't go back to Boston? - No. - Uh. Where are you going? (folk music) That tells me a lot. That explains everything. Great, great. I am going back (door opening) to Boston. (door closing) I'm going right now. - Hey, you can't go out there. What are you doing? - Ah fuck. - Are you crazy? - Yes, I'm crazy. - It's duck hunting season. - It's not, it's summer. - How do you know? What? You read the Farmer's Almanac? Polly, I can't leave the limo here. It's evidence. - What? Evidence of what, Lyn? (folk music) (water splashing) (train riding by) Jesus, Polly, it's a god damn typhoon out here. - Why don't you just go back to your fucking limo? - Don't get hysterical. - I'm not hysterical. (woman screaming) - Don't move, don't move. I'll help you. - Ouh, Lyn. Ouh. - Pull me, pull me. (water splashing) - Oh, fuck. (sighing) I was gonna get the train. (train going by) - How do you know where it's going? - It's going back to Boston, where I should be. - I'll tell you what's back in Boston. Nothing but boring, apathetic, routine existence. - Yeah, well Lyn, at least most of the people in Boston aren't criminals. - Take a deep breath. And look around cause, it really is very beautiful up here right now. - I have a wicked hangover, I'm covered in mud. And I haven't even had my coffee yet. - You look beautiful. - Look at me. - Lyn, why did you do this? - You know why I did this. - No. I don't. You're gonna have to tell me. (train going by) (guitar strumming) (sighing) I'm so tired. - Yeah, me too. What the hell was that? - Lyn, let's go back to Boston. - Okay. - Will you just hold me first? Just for a second. (windshield wipers running) (rock music) - It's been a long time. Why did you decide to call? Well, Lyn, I just wanted to say that... - [Voiceover] I become my father over and over again every day. I'm aware of it. You repeat the patterns. Generations in revolt understand that and don't want it to happen. But it happens anyway. (rock music) (raining) - This doesn't look like Boston, Lyn. - He's not home. He's loaded. - Come on. - He can buy you a ticked back to Boston. - Cut it out. Let me just put things into perspective for you here. You don't have any money. That credit card's gonna run out. The guy's gonna cancel it. How you gonna get gas? Forget gas. Lyn, you're in a stolen limo. How you gonna get across the border? You're not gonna make it, Lyn. I mean, how are you gonna get through that gap thing? - The Darien Gap. - You can't get a job down there. I mean, things aren't gonna be any different than they were in Boston. What are you gonna do? - I'll burn that bridge when I get to it. - What about your documentary? - The tapes are in the back. I'll finish it when I get there. - So, you're gonna drive five million miles in a stolen limousine with no money, cross the border, slash your way through some mystical Darian Gap, to make a film about Generation X? - You're forgetting about the giant sloth. (sighing) - I read those letters from your dad. (guitar strumming) - Um, there' some Jim Beam in the back. Would you get it for me please? - Sure. Sure. - I told you. - Told me what? - You heard me. Up there. Didn't you? - Yeah. (car screeching off) - Can I help you? (guitar strumming) - Hi. (folk music) - [Voiceover] Freud had a phrase. The family romance. That's what goes on in your family. The love in family. (door opening) That's the crux of the problem, isn't it? Love. It's a corny road, right. It's not a word that enters the post-modern vocabulary much. It's what our parents had. Right, so we look at it with a kind of jaundice eye really. - Generation X, oh Jesus. - But, do we need it? Of course we do. We just find some way to say it. (organ flute music) (water swooshing) Rebellious energy is the most carefully managed energy in our culture today. That's my opinion about it. I think a lot of these kids, these upper middle class rebellious kids, and I have to include myself, a lot of these kids are full of it. (film reel rolling) (guitar strumming)
