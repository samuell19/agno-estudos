Okay, why don't you wait here, we'll check it out. ♪♪ Hey, I found one in here. Can somebody do something about this dog outside? He's got the yard staked out, nobody can move. Hey. Over here. We got a bad one. Double homicide. One in the basement, one outside. Don't we have anything? Nothing yet. No weapon, no witnesses. The neighbor next door thinks he heard the dog barking around midnight. I'd like to know how he got past it. Any sign of forced entry? We're not sure yet. Where are the kids? The 7-year-old's in the living room. Brian, the one who called, is outside. You wanna talk to them here? No, let's bring 'em both down to the station. Does he know yet? I don't know, I don't think so. I was waiting for you to show up. You wanna tell him? No, I'm gonna take a look around, you go ahead. [sighing] Thanks. [helicopter flying, sirens] We live in this neighborhood. Why can't you tell us what happened? I'm sorry, ma'am, we're not allowed to say. Hold on, hold on, nobody's allowed to go into the house.

No. I went to bed around 10:30. I was asleep. I think I remember Chris coming into my room later. Midnight, maybe. Um, he said he was scared. He said, uh, he heard noises. I thought he was just having a nightmare, so I told him to go back to sleep. I went back to sleep. I didn't come downstairs until this morning. Okay, I think we all need a little break. This kid is way too calm. He heard nothing last night? I don't buy it. Why would he lie? I don't know. Let's leave him in there for a while, let him think there's a problem. Tom. I'm sorry, I didn't know who else to call. No, you did the right thing. Where are the kids? They're still questioning them. But, what is this-- who's questioning them? Hi, I'm Tom Kelley, I'm a lawyer. Who asked for a lawyer? And I'm a friend of the Hannigan family. Why are you holding these boys? We're not holding anybody, we're just asking some questions. Look, these kids are traumatized, they're exhausted. We'd like to take them home. Are you representing these kids, or are you their friend? What difference does that make? Look, look, look, gentlemen, excuse me. Look, why don't you wait out here, have some coffee? Let us talk to the little boy, and then you can go, okay? Is there a suspect? There might be. Can I ask who it is? No, you can't. It's right back there. There's no reason to be scared of us, Chris. Okay, all we want you to do is just to... just tell us what you know, okay? Now... did you hear any noises last night? I heard my dad. He was screaming for help. Can you remember what time that was? Uh-uh. Think about it, Chris. Did you tell anyone else what you heard? That's okay. What did you do next? I went to the basement, and I saw my dad, on his back. And I went out to the porch, and I saw somebody in the backyard, a man. What was that man doing? He was walking away from the house into the woods, dragging something, like a shovel. Do you remember what he looked like? Did you know him, Chris? He looked like my brother. Brian? Daniel. Who's Daniel? He's our other brother. Where's Daniel now? Hospital. What hospital is that, Chris? Crownsville. You mean, the state hospital? Why is he there, Chris? He doesn't like my parents. And why doesn't Daniel like your parents? They don't like him. [door opening] Brian? Hi. Hi, you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. Are they finished? It's over. I'm here to help you. Is Chris all right? He's fine. Brian, there may be a problem. Chris said that he saw Daniel in the yard last night. Daniel? Chris didn't tell me that. That's impossible, Daniel's in Crownsville. So, how long's he been here? Came in about a month ago. Pulled a knife on a social worker. By the way, he hasn't been told about his parents yet. Do you want me to say anything? Don't tell him. You sure he was here all night? Well, security said they checked him off. Wait here, I'll get him for you. Hey, Henry. Security? [walkman playing] What do you want? I want you to come out in the hall. Some men wanna talk to you. Let me know when you finish. Daniel, no smoking in the halls, okay? We're with Annapolis Police, we'd like to ask a few questions. Where were you last night? Gee, where was I? Let's see, I went down to the mall about 8:00, I had something to eat, I saw a movie. Did you leave the premises? Is that what this place is, the premises? Does this look like a place you can just walk out of? Yeah, it does. Is somebody trying to screw me here? If it says I checked Daniel Hannigan off at 11:30, I checked him off. So, you saw him. I checked him off. That's not what I'm asking. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, time out. Bobby, you're making too big a deal about this. There's what, 150 patients here? I mean, you can't expect him to make sure every kid is tucked in by 11:00, am I right? Am I? I mean, what are you gonna do? Walk up to every bed with a flashlight, look under the covers? No, you poke your head in the room and you eyeball it, right? You guess. Hey man, I didn't say that. Don't get excited, nobody's gonna get reported. We just want the truth. Now, did you see this kid at 11:30 or not? No. There you go, he guessed. Norman! Listen, nobody can confirm they saw him past 10:00 last night at Crownsville. You know how lack security is there. This kid has a record. His parents had to put him in reform school last year, that's a motive. His own brother identified him in the backyard. His 7-year-old brother. You want to make an arrest because somebody's a bad kid? Open this up, think further. I mean, it's possible the murders had nothing to do with the family. Hey, look, nobody wants to make an arrest more than I do. But, if we book a 17-year-old kid for killing his parents, and it turns out he's innocent-- We know, we know. No, no, no, you don't know. You do it by the numbers, and you get me the evidence, and you do it now. Daniel? Daniel, something has happened to your family that you should know about. Come on, sit down. I, um, I don't know how to say this, other than to just say it. This morning, your parents were found murdered in their home. They think I did it. [knocking] They want to look around. Will you turn your soles up, please? This your only pair of shoes? Would you take them off, please? Thanks. I'm sorry. I'll, uh, get you another pair of shoes. They were very family oriented. Hard working people. Maureen was a high school teacher, her husband Joe was an engineer, a layman in our church who taught Sunday School to the kids here. They were very giving people. This has been a special report... They just interviewed Father Greg on TV. Is Brian okay? He's fine. He's staying with Barbara. Well, what did he say when you talked to him? Ken Pierson, please. Rick, can you talk about it in here? Just asking. I know you were, I just-- Uh, hi, this is Tom Kelley. Would you ask Ken to call me as soon as he can, please? Thank you. I was on the phone. [door slams] [sighing] He's upset about this, too. Are you sure you want to get involved with this? I don't have a choice. I called a criminal attorney, Ken Pierson. Daniel's a suspect, isn't he, Tom? They're wrong. You know, Joe and Maureen were afraid of him. He made a-- a threat once. To do what? To kill them. Maureen told me and Barbara about it last year. Those are words, a-- a kid can say a lot of things. He can say "I hate you" out of anger. Daniel's an angry kid, but, he's still just a kid. [camera clicking] Hurry up! I'm coming, damnit! [thunder rumbling] Come here, come here. I want you to take this over to the lab, and keep it covered. And get some plastic sheets out here, we're losing everything in this rain. Yes, sir. I'll leave a light in the hall for you, okay? I love you. Good night. ♪♪ Look at me. You have to be sure. Are you sure it was Daniel you saw? [sighing] ♪♪ Daniel, hi. I'm Tom Kelley. Do you remember me? Yeah, you were my parents' lawyer friend, right? I want you to know that we are doing everything that we can to make sure that you and your brothers are going to be taken care of. Am I still getting out of here tomorrow? A judge has to decide that. They can't keep me here. I already had my hearing. I had my evaluation, I have no illness, man. There's nothing wrong with me. Why are they keeping me here? Daniel, you know why. You're a suspect. I wasn't there. Someone around here is trying to screw me, right? Who is it? Look, I didn't see Mom and Dad for a year, okay? I was out of their life, they wanted nothing to do with me. Why? I-- I don't know. Ask Brian. He's backing me, right? Of course he is. All of us are. We'll do whatever we can. You're in our prayers, Daniel. I don't want anybody's prayers. Just get me out of here. When was the last time you spoke to Daniel? Six months ago. You and your brother were close. We are, we are. But, it was hard to stay close when he moved away. Sit down. Did Daniel ever threaten your parents? Maybe. You know Daniel, he-- he could lose his temper. Over what? Anything. He's different from you. How did that happen? He's always been like that, from the day I met him. We were adopted. That's right, of course, I-- I knew that, I just forgot. You were how old? Six. Your parents loved you more than anything, you know that. What do you want to know? I wanna know about your family, I wanna know about Daniel. I wanna know about you. I remember my first day.

Oh, get ready, we just started. For the first time in my life, I had something that was mine-- a family. I had everything I wanted. Everybody likes you, everybody likes you. Except one thing. Ah, guess who's got a birthday coming up? What do you want for your birthday? I want a brother, a younger brother. Well, guess what? Maureen? Oh, it's all right, we can tell him. You aregonna get a brother! Really, when? Uh huh! Well, as soon as we can. We already met him. And you know what? He's just like you. Mwah! Mm. Brian, this is Daniel. Daniel, this is Brian. Joe, Maureen, we have some paperwork to go over. Okay. Uh, boys, why don't you wait right here, we'll be right back. You stay seated right here. Okay, Brian?

How long have you been with them? Three months. Did you get anything yet? I got a dog. That week, Daniel became my brother. I wasn't sure if I liked him at first. Brian, remember our boundaries! We will. There, there, and there. We can't go past those. [dog barking] ♪♪ Come on. Where'd you get those? I collect them. He was hyper. He never followed the rules. He didn't care what people thought about him. He did whatever he wanted. I didn't want him in trouble. Daniel? Where'd you live before us? Different places. How come you don't live with your parents? 'Cause, they moved me away from them. Why? 'Cause of my dad. He used to beat me up. How? With the board. Can I have one? If you're nice to it, this one's yours. In the evening, after our chores, we had study time. We had to be ready for school in the fall. Come on, Daniel! Dad wanted to prepare us for the Naval Academy when we got older. The academy was only a few miles away from where we lived. Sometimes, you could hear the band playing in the afternoon. [band playing] That was his dream. No, no, no, Brian, here. Let-- let me show you again. Okay, all right. We have ten, and we take away five. And what does that give us? Six. How can that be six? It's five. Can we go outside? When we're finished. We went over this five times yesterday, buddy. It's okay, honey, don't worry, we'll get it. Brian, look. You got one, two, three, four, five, six crackers, okay? Now, we take away two, and that leaves us what-- Daniel, don't eat the crackers, please, you're confusing him. So, four plus two, is what? Four, plus two? Six. What did I just say to you?

I saw him, he gave him the answer, I saw him do it. You gave him the answer. Just forget it. Here, have that one. It's okay, just forget it. It's okay. Apologize to me, young man. No! I said apologize! Why should I? They always felt bad after they got angry, especially Dad. They would sit and talk about it for hours. "What do we do about Daniel?" I liked my brother. I liked the idea that he was mine. No one could take that away from me. ♪♪ Tom Kelley? Uh, you must be Ken Pierson. Um, did you-- did you get started?

I always wanted a brother who would look up to me, somebody I could take care of, you know, like Chris. I never could protect Daniel. Protect him from what? My dad was a computer engineer. He was somebody who wanted to build the world. Right here. He always had these big ideas, but they never seemed to get finished. It's gonna go right here. Honey, the um, what-- what do you call it? The gazebo? Yeah, the gazebo's gonna go right there. I can see it. So, who's building it? What do you mean, who's building it-- we are. Come on, son, you know there's no such thing as a free ride. You wanna have the first pool in the neighborhood, you gotta help build it. Come on, come help me move this. I didn't ask for a pool. Brian, you want a pool? Yeah, sounds great. Oh yeah, man, yeah, it sounds great. Let's get out those shovels, start digging up that yard, boys. Cheap labor, man. Are you cynical about everything, Daniel? What's the matter, son, can't you hack it? Scared of a little work? Brian, put those right over there, atta boy. Discipline, hard work. I'll make a midshipman out of you yet.

How am I supposed to get to school? You get off the bus, and you walk! Nobody wants you here, man! You jerk, get off! You tell your parents this time he's off for good. You sit here and you lie to our faces. You lie about not going to school, you lie about the fights. You lie about not smoking. He hit me first. Brian, you were there, did you see this? He wasn't there. Brian, who started it? He didn't see it. We want to trust you, Daniel. You don't trust me. Well, did you ever wonder why, huh? I mean, we trust him, we don't have to worry about him. Why do you think we single you out? How the hell should I know? Don't talk to me like that in my house. Can I be excused, please? Daniel? If you do not pull it together, you know what's gonna happen. Yeah, what? Say it, what? Say it! Go to the basement. Go outside, I'll turn the light on when it's time. I'll keep your supper warm, okay? Brian? It's dark, don't go far. What am I gonna do with you? Oh, you're the tough guy, right. How many times I gotta bring you down here, huh? You tell me how-- How many times?! I usually got sent away when the beatings started.

[scoffs] He could have, uh, tracked blood on the shoes the morning after. He said he never went into the basement. Come on, he was in shock. He could have blocked something like that out. I think we're gonna have to find someplace new for Brian to stay. Crowley's asking the court that Brian and Chris be separated. Why? Crowley's smart. He's building up a case against Brian, and it's a lot easier to convince the court if he's-- can say he's got a murder suspect living with a 7-year-old. They're wrong on this. I know Brian, this kid could not do what was done in that basement. He's not even capable of thinking about it. This is not the same kid. You don't believe him, do you? What if we can't find anybody to take him in? Then the court will do it for us. No, no! These kids have suffered enough. I will not have them shuffled around like this, not after what they've been through. Then, who's gonna take him in? Do I have to dress up for the funeral? Yes, of course you do. Where's Dad? He had to go back in to work. Where else? What does that mean? Nothing, it's just, he's never here anyway. Why is this week any different? You know why it's different. Why would you say that? Your father cares about you, all of you. Come on, you know that. Don't you? [phone ringing] Hello? Hi, let me talk to your mom. Hello? Hi. We have to find a place for Brian to stay after the funeral tomorrow. I thought the kids were staying with Barbara. It looks like the court may want Brian and Chris separated. Brian's a suspect. If they had evidence, they would arrest him. Where is he going to stay? Well, I think he should stay with us, but, I wanted to ask you first. What do you want me to say? We have to say yes. [choir singing, bells tolling] Excuse me, excuse me, let me through, please. [sighing] I can't-- I can't do this. It's gonna be okay. I'll be with you.

May God love you. [all] Amen. [organ music playing] This is a funeral, for God's sake, what are they doing here? Don't worry about it, they're just here to look. It's business.

[overlapping chatter] You don't need to do this. I told you, it's okay. Come here-- No, don't. It's not okay. This case was a conflict from the beginning. This is not a case. Then, what is it? Why are you doing this? You tell me what I should do. Turn him away? These are children-- What about our children? Shh. What about them? You're being irrational. No, you are being irrational. You think these kids are innocent because you want them to be innocent. Is everybody else wrong? Everybody? Do you honestly believe that I would put our own children in danger? Do you? It isn't just about him, is it? [overlapping chatter] [clock chiming] Brian? I can't sleep. I was just thinking about Chris. He gets scared when he's alone. It's okay if I still call him, right? We'll call first thing in the morning. Brian, I need to ask you something. The police found your shoes in the kitchen under the sink. There was blood on the shoes. Why do I have to keep saying this-- I don't remember what happened, I don't. Look, Brian, I believe you, but there are others now who don't, and I have to convince them that they're wrong. You have to trust me, you-- you can't keep things from me. I'm not the authorities. I understand you more than you know. I'm just not comfortable talking about how I feel about things. I was always afraid to speak up. I know what that's like. My family was a lot like yours. My mother died when I was 11. We were raised by my father. He never physically abused us, he just ignored us. There was never any joy in our house, it was only, quiet. I grew up thinking that was normal. Fathers weren't supposed to talk to their kids, and you were not supposed to talk to them. That's notnormal. What did you do? I left. I ran away from him. All the birthdays, my wedding, graduations, promotions-- he missed it all. He's never even seen his own grandchildren. I don't understand that. But, uh, I have to look forward, I don't look back. That's how I've dealt with it. All the gatherings, the church groups that we were in with your mom and dad, we never knew what was happening to Daniel. No one knew. [overlapping chatter] Hey! Watch it, watch it!

Good, good. You got it? Good, good, good. Atta boy. Nice! Good one, good one, good one. Set it up, set it up. Watch it. Daniel, you okay? Is he all right? Daniel? Yeah, he's fine, he's fine. I told you, son, you gotta watch yourself. Where you going? Daniel, it was an accident. Daniel, wait up. No, no, if he doesn't want to play, don't make him. Come on, Brian. Brian, let him go! Come on, let's get somebody else in here, let's go! Come on, guys, let's play. Hey, do you wanna play? Yeah. That's all he does, man, is just get on me. I know you don't wanna be here, man, let's just go. We can come back later. I can't, what do I say? Just tell him you wanna come with me, you found something better to do. Come on. I can't. [women laughing] Where did you come up with that? Hi, handsome. Hi, can I sit here? Of course you can. Don't want to eat at the kid's table, huh? Put your shirt on, honey, it's cold. Besides, all the girls are watching. Mom. Daniel left, of course. Yeah, he's gone. Oh, God, sometimes I think it's hopeless. I don't understand how somebody can be so angry and bitter about everything. It's hormonal. All 15-year-olds are angry about something, present company excluded. No, no, I've been a teacher too long. First day of class, I can pick 'em out. I know who the good kids are, I know who the bad kids are. And you know what? I'm always right. Well, it's an awkward age. You don't know how many times I've been at the principal's office this year. He's violent, he fights, he cheats, you can't trust him. Maureen. Hey Brian, honey, why don't you go sit with the kids? Oh, no, no. No, he's heard all this before. [sighing] Daniel even threatened us once. He told me he could kill us. Brian, did you hear him say that? Well, that's an awful thing to say, I'm sure he didn't mean it. Oh, no, no, he meant it. He got so mad at Joe, one night he came up to me after dinner, and he said, "I could kill him, you know?" Just like that. Why would he say something like that? Because he's an angry person. Maureen, maybe you're coming down too hard on him. Oh, please don't tell me how to raise my kids, Barbara. Scott has one parent, it's different. Why is it different? Why does the blame always come back on us? Maureen, I'm not blaming you. You just can't expect everything to be perfect. I just think kids need some room, you know? Some space. Oh yeah, space, freedom. Let's just throw out all the rules, let them be themselves. That's the answer to everything these days. Oh, Barbara. Oh, I love you, I really do. But, you can be so naive sometimes. You have no idea. No idea. You can't just walk off like that. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna let this ruin my day, I'm not. Your father will deal with this later. And he did. His way. We can go, man. We could take a bus to Florida, or get an apartment, or... We don't need them. I hate them. What's wrong with me? [sighing] You want anything while I'm out? No, thanks. [dog barking] Like always, Daniel was asking to get caught. Where were you, Daniel? Out-- just let me in, Mom. Come on, let me in! Please? Don't open the door. Go back to bed. [crying] We failed. No, no, we did not fail. What's happening? Where's Daniel going? He's leaving. Leaving? He can't leave. Where's he going? You can't do this, stop. Stop! Where did Daniel go? I was never told. I kept asking if he was coming back home. They never said that he was, they never said that he wasn't. That's just the way it was with them. They left you wondering about everything. They never gave up custody? No, no, they wouldn't do that. They wanted him, they just didn't want him in the house. They had somebody else to replace him. Everybody loved Chris. I could see that he was becoming the center of Mom and Dad's life, where I used to be. By the way, where's Daniel? Daniel's gone. Gone-- what do you mean gone? Uh, Brian, will you take Chris with you? Sure. Come on. We had to put him back in foster care. There was nothing else we could do. Same thing that happened to Daniel could happen to Brian. Come on, Joe. No, I'm serious, Tom, it could. We were way too lenient with Daniel, and that was such a problem. And, um, that's just not gonna happen again. Where is Daniel? Oh, he's fine, Tom, he's fine. It's all gonna work out for the best. Three months later, Daniel really blew it. [window opening] [laughing] Hey man, check this out. Think fast. Yo, man! [glass breaking] Faster! Hey, hey, hey! Chill out! [dog barking] ♪♪ [screaming] Danny! Hey, man, what's wrong with you, huh? What the hell's wrong with you? You crazy? The cops! [siren blaring] The first call he made was to Mom and Dad. You got yourself arrested, Daniel, you live with it! It's your fault, it's not our fault. What? What?! Don't you dare talk to me like that again! You call your foster parents, you call them! Daniel, don't call the house again. Is Daniel all right? Is Daniel all right? Oh, thank you for that, Brian, thank you for asking. No, Mom, that's not what I meant. Oh, I know what you meant. Things are gonna change around here. We're gonna have to start cracking down on you. Why, what did I do? You know why. No, I don't, Mom. What did I do? You know why! No, Mom, I really don't. What did I do? You know why! I don't know. Dad began to spend less time with us at home, and more time volunteering. He was always donating his time to causes and the church, reminding us that there were always people less fortunate in the world. He could spend hours with people, comforting them, making sure they had someone to talk to. But, I don't remember a time when my father and I had a real conversation. Ever. The year Daniel left, Mom became a teacher at my high school. Every morning, we walked to school together. [school bell ringing] I never knew why Mom and Dad suddenly changed, why they lost their trust in me. They were convinced I was going to fail. I missed Daniel, but high school gave me a chance to meet a few friends, and Lisa, the first girl I ever liked. What is interesting is that the Bronte sisters... I guess she had kind of a reputation with some of the guys. That didn't bother me. She didn't seem to care what people thought about her. I liked that. ...and "Jane Eyre", which you all just read. Now, I'd like you to take out your notes, and... No-- Mom, I tried to-- I tried to call you, you weren't home. No, I'm not lying, why-- The movie's starting, come on. Are there girls there? Who's there? Where's Barbara? Honey, go watch the video. Hi, Maureen, what's the problem? Who are the girls? What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about-- who are the girls over there, do I know them? Maureen, I'm not taking names, what is the problem? You can't trust Brian around a girl, you can't trust any boy around a girl, you know that. Maureen, you are overreacting. Overreacting? Send him home, now! [dial tone] I'm sorry, honey. [sighing] What was the name of that-- that march, the traditional march with your-- Brian? Every year, Mom and Dad sponsored a midshipman from the Naval Academy. A chance, they said, for someone who might be homesick, to get a homecooked meal. Uniforms, the pomp, the ceremony, I love all that. You know, I think we're missing that today in our country, that sense of tradition. Without it, we're-- we're lost. Joe wanted to go to the academy. Oh! Finish the story, Maureen. Well, the opportunities weren't there for-- I was never really encouraged. What about you, Brian? What are your plans after high school? Well, his grades are so bad, he'll be lucky to get out of high school. See, Brian, this is what I've been talking about. This is the payoff right here. I never knew how to get that point across to you and Daniel. Chris? You still have a chance. Daniel? Um... Daniel is my brother. Oh, where's he? He's in reform school. Dessert? Daniel and I found a way to talk to each other. I had to be careful not to let Mom or Dad know. What's reform school like? Hm, it's great, man. I mean, they got rules and everything, but... Lights out, guys. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. Nobody's telling me what to do anymore. So, what do-- what do they say about me? Who? Mom and Dad. Do they talk about me? Yeah, sometimes. You know what, man? I don't even care if they do, or if they don't. Doesn't matter. Wrap it up, Hannigan. I'm happier now than I ever was. You know, I get out for the weekend. A lot of guys are going home, and I don't even know if I want to go home. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even care. Why don't you call Mom and Dad? Why should I have to call them, why don't they call me? It's my home, do I have to be invited? I wanna see you. Come on, Hannigan, let's go. Well, then, you gotta talk to Mom and Dad. 'Cause I can't. Mom and Dad agreed to a visit from Daniel. They wanted a picnic. Hey. Hey. How you doing? I really thought they might ask him to come home again. This is Chris. Hey, how you doing? Good. My new brother. Hey, Scott. Hey, man. I'm thinking about going to college and getting my degree. Maybe computers. I haven't really decided yet. That's great, Daniel. Once I learn how to use one, maybe I can teach Brian. We can start our own company or something. Or something. Where you gonna get the money for these computers? Well, if you want something bad enough, you'll get it. I'm gonna clear the table. You have dessert, Mom? Of course. Let me help with the dishes. Oh no, that's all right. Stay there. I want to help. It's fine, Daniel. We can handle it. Why? Let him help. Daniel, stay. What is this? I just want to go in the house to help-- What, you don't want me in the house? Is that it? I do live here, right? This is my house, isn't it? Isn't it? That's why we're sitting in the rain. How could you do this? It's not fair, man, they can't do this to you, it's not fair! I wanna kill 'em. [crying] Chris, honey? Sweetheart. Don't worry, honey, I'm here. Don't worry, sweetie. [phone ringing] Hello? Hi, Tom, it's Barbara. Um, listen, is Brian in the room? No, he's still asleep. I think we need to bring Chris back to the police. Hi, Mrs. Forester, I was just calling to check in on Chris. Uh, are you taking him to mass this morning? He went where? What are you thinking about, Chris? Well, just about that night and my brother. Now, which brother are we talking about? Brian. What do you wanna tell us about Brian? Well, after I saw my dad, when I went to Brian's room, he was throwing up. I forgot to tell you that. And what did Brian say to you when you say him throwing up? He told me to go back to bed. You told us that you saw Daniel in the backyard that night. Chris, think real hard. Do you think it might have been Brian? Maybe. But you told us, though, that Brian was in his bedroom, remember? But, Brian couldn't be in two places at the same time now, could he? After you saw Brian in the backyard, do you think that, well, he might have had enough time to come back inside the house without you seeing him? Maybe. What do you want me to tell you? I want the truth, Daniel. Tell me it's not Brian. You wish it was me. No, no, Daniel. I'm sure a lot of people out there do. I mean, given a choice, right? Daniel, Brian told me about your family. If you and Brian are in trouble, we can help you. There's a warrant out for Brian's arrest. Where is he? Barbara took him to mass. I'll-- I'll go pick him up, and meet you back in my office in an hour. This may be our last chance to talk to him. Look, Brian told you there was no communication between Daniel and the family, is that right? For at least six months. Listen, Tom, I got a copy of the phone records here. There were at least a dozen calls to Daniel in the last three months. Somebody from the Hannigan house called Daniel the night of the murders. I don't know, Tom, maybe it's not Daniel or Brian. Maybe it's both. [bells tolling] ♪♪ How could this happen? What-- what were they doing to these kids? They had so many expectations. They were the most optimistic people I'd ever known. They used to tell me that adopting Daniel and Brian was God's calling, that they never thought there'd be any of the pain and hardship that comes with raising kids. Then, when they found out it wasn't what they bargained for, they couldn't handle the disappointment. They were terrified of failing. Where was Brian before he was adopted? Maureen told me once. Um, his father, nobody really knew. His mother abandoned him, for the most part. Left him alone for days at a time. Drifted in and out of his life, till finally, the state took custody of him. Where did he go? Into the system. Foster care, like Daniel. How many different families did they have? Daniel had five. Brian had six. Listen, Brian, we have a little problem. The police don't believe your story, they think you're lying. I'm-- I'm not. Son, they're gonna be asking you a lot of questions, like how you got blood on your shoes, and why you didn't hear anything on the night of the murder. I wanna talk to Daniel. No, you can't talk to Daniel. There's no more time, Brian, there's no more time. Talk to me. Tell me. It doesn't make any difference to me what happened. Just tell me the truth. Whatever the truth is, I promise you, I will not leave you. I don't believe that, you-- I will not leave you. Brian, how could you have not heard your parents that night? How do you explain that? Tell us what happened, Brian, come on, just tell us. Just let it go. Come on, son. I'm gonna stay with you, Brian. If you tell me the truth, it's not gonna change that. I can't. Yes you can, yes you can. I can't. Tell me what happened. I can't! [sobbing] They wouldn't stop hurting me. They wouldn't stop hurting me. They wouldn't stop hurting me. [crying and repeating] [sighing] I'm gonna go over to Crowley's office, see if they give us a couple more hours. Don't leave him alone, Tom. ♪♪ Do you have a cigarette? You don't have to talk.
