In the past day, more than 100 rockets were fired in Israel Missiles were fired again at the Western Galilee. Our correspondent in the North, reports that there were two missiles, one fell within Israeli borders. The beauty of Israel is that it'’s a small country. You can get from one end to the other in a few hours; six, seven hours. On the other hand, there'’s nowhere to escape to. Since everything is close, we'’re always under threat. A war could break out at any second, without notice. I'’m Eden, I'm 20. Almost 21. I'’m an officer in the Paratroopers. I have a platoon of 40 soldiers. And we have eight months to train them, To transform them from citizens into soldiers. The second Lebanon war was in 2006. The whole area here came under heavy missile and rocket attack. A missile landed right here, behind this house. Suddenly the missile passes right over the house, lands here, explodes. Just here, a black cloud of smoke, a loud blast, all the windows shook. At the time, I didn'’t know what I wanted to do in the army. I knew I had to serve. I understood that I had to be a combat soldier. It'’s the feeling that you're here, protecting your home. Here it starts. Today'’s the... The start of a marathon. It'’s not a choice to go to the army. Everyone has to serve; it'’s the law in Israel. And you have to serve three years. Playtime is over! You'’ll be hearing this a lot from now on. Playtime is over. Finished! We'’ll what's going on right now is that The soldiers finally got into... selected into each unit. Form a straight line, properly. Everyone look to the guy on your right and straighten the line. Eight and a half minutes, move! They'’re all in shock. They don'’t know where they are. They all look at us, and I feel they say to themselves, "“What the heck am I doing here?"” They just finished high school maybe a month ago. -Come, you'’re over here. -— You'’re over here, bro. For most of them, it'’s the... Probably will be the Longest period of time without seeing their parents. There'’s no such thing as being late with me, ever! There'’s nothing I hate more than lateness! You don'’t decide anything suddenly. You don'’t decide when to sleep. You don'’t even get to grow your hair, nothing. You'’re like everyone else. You wear everything ... like everyone else. You look like everyone. One-Two, Two-One, One... I have no words to describe it, Except to say that I'’m very excited, first of all. And I'’ve been waiting for this moment. Under me there is a staff sergeant, Tom Sela, And three sergeants: Ofir Vadas, Maor Gavra, And Guy Sheetrit. In a couple of minutes I will get my soldiers. I'’m very excited. I'’m very excited. It'’s real active duty, but you'’re still separate, Not with the senior members in the unit. I'’m Ofir, Ofir Vadas, I live in Haifa. I'’m a little nervous, But I'’m not worried because Eden... Eden will teach us everything... We are going to know. Attention! At ease, come sit. Hello. I'’m Eilon. -How are you? -—Just fine, and you? Excellent. I was in a meeting with the commander of the unit, Eden. It'’s important to me that you know that there is an open channel between us. This means that when you feel you need to turn to me, to talk, If you feel you need to speak with me, don'’t be embarrassed to come and ask. Very, you know, Warm atmosphere, And... I think it'’s a... Really smart move, and I like it. And, It really makes me feel At home you know? Good luck! Thanks very much, bro. I mean, Sir. It'’s only the beginning, Because after that it will be very hard, of course. "“Nechita Raka."” Soft landing, you know? And then they will kill us. Come on! Come on! Come! Leave that! Come on! Guys, when there's one minute left, everyone start running. -Go, run, run! - Run, come on! -Ouch! -Sorry Come one, guys! Everyone, circle up! Come on, second squad, over here! When the Platoon Commander enters, everything must be perfect. Attention! -Good Evening, Platoon1. -—Good evening, Platoon Commander What we'’re going to do now since you don'’t know each other, we'’ll do a quick round, saying you name, where you live and what squad you'’re in. For example, in my ID card when I was born it says my name is Tom Sela. I live in Tzur Yigal, and I'’m 21. My real name, the name you'’ll use in the coming months, my first name is commander, and my last name is Sergeant. Commander Sergeant. Let me tell you that at home I'’m called Commander Sergeant. My grandmother calls me Commander Sergeant. My parents call me Commander Sergeant Don'’t laugh. It'’s totally serious. You'’ll call me Commander Sergeant. Shut up before I kick you all out here. By the time this pen hits the ground, You will all be standing on the chairs. When you get off the chairs, you wipe those smiles off, too. Let'’s go... First of all, welcome. You have taken a very important step to protect the State of Israel. The situation here in the company, as you know, Is not too rosy. And we'’re the ones who are going to protect the States of Israel, the ones who will guard the northern border in eight months'’ time. To give the people of Israel a sense of security. It isn'’t a simple mission. But it is an important mission. Understood? Yes, platoon Commander! Well, this day is the first day they are actually shooting, using their gun for their first time. I'’m assigning targets. No one move. Stand on the firing line and receive a target. They have a lot of pressure on them. Most of them, it'’s the first time that they ever, fire a gun. -Weapons at a 60-degree angle! -Weapons at a 60-degree angle! I'’m going to give you the weapon now. Don'’t release the safety, okay? For me, it'’s my first time. I was very excited. My commander, Eden, instructed me how to shoot. It pretty much was what I thought it would be. but the noise and the, boom; it'’s very different than a computer game. -Scared you a bit? -Umm, no. I want all my soldiers to think that everyone that come here, is protecting every Israeli citizen. Not just the jews. Anyone who has Israeli citizenship, whether they are Arab, Muslim, Christian, Druze, Circassian. It'’s the day you wait for more than anything. It'’s the day you feel you're becoming a combat soldier. Okay, you need to adjust... down by 11 clicks. It'’s a little bit scary to take a gun in your hands. it'’s like, not for kids. It can really hurt someone, and we have... we have to be responsible about it. How did a magazine disappear from your pocket? No, honestly, tell me. How a magazine disappeared from your pocket? How? -You were, umm? -Where is the magazine? How did it disappear? No talking in the shooting range. Where is the magazine? Go find it now! Woe to the person I catch fooling around with his weapon. This weapon take lives. Although it saves lives, And with its help we protect the people of Israel, And protect people in general, but it takes lives. And fooling around with weapons takes lives. Listen, listen carefully. When it comes to equipment, don'’t mess with me! I swear to you, first I'’ll take you apart, and then I'’ll make sure you get a fine that your little army salary won'’t cover. -Am I clear? Yes, Commander Sergeant! They teach us that our gun is like our girlfriend, because you'’re sleeping with it. You'’re eating with it. You'’re shooting with it. You'’re going everywhere with this gun. She has already a name, "“Dalia."” Think how crazy it is, eight hours ago you didn'’t know what a weapon is, and now you are firing the weapon, you know how to hit. Think about how far you'’ve come in eight hours. Imagine where you'’ll be in eight months. Insanely good! That'’s what you'll be. Listen, bro, I didn'’t have time to do anything. The recruits got their first march. They'’re going to carry their vest, their weapon the first time, their magazines. You'’ve got the heaviest pack. You'’re carrying [44 pounds], bro. Let'’s do it! They'’re going to walk [2.5 miles]. It may seem short, but for them it'’s a long way. I'’m going to paint your faces, every one of you. Smile, everyone, it'’s your first march. Alon, shut up. Anyone need more paint? Do you want more paint? Come on, lay the paint on Booki! Forward, march! Good evening, Golan company. Good evening, Company Commander! These are your very... first steps as combat soldiers. Quiet, everyone. Always remember the saying: "“The Eternal Nation is not afraid of a long journey."” -Clear? -Yes, Commander Ofir! You will all complete this march. If anyone feels weak, you'’ll help them, push them on. -Who'’s crazy about 1-C? -Commander Guy! -Who'’s crazy about Commander Guy? 1-C Go, Lions! Lions! The first march is always difficult, always difficult. And the first march is traumatic, but in a good way. Everyone remembers it because it'’s more personal than it is physical. I want them to learn, now they'’re part of the company. They know they'’re part of the class. They can do everything. -First squad, what are you? -Lions! When I see a big smile on their face, I say it will be a great success. Go, go quickly! Thirty seconds! Eight minutes left. Okay, guys, guys. Guys, does anyone need help with anything? Exactly one minute left! Lights out in: three, two, one... Good night, first squad! Good night, Commander Ofir! -David. -Mom. -Come sit here, come. -Come, sit with us. Who are you texting now? I have to send the commander a message. Sorry. So send it. Oh, no, I sent him a wink. Wow, bummer! Right, that'’s it. Hi! -Come on, let'’s go to the beach. -Shotgun! I really love the beach-—love to hang out, friends. -What'’s up, bro? -Wow, I haven'’t seen you in so long! [sings "“Here Comes the Sun"”] Our group always sits here, playing this song. It'’s our group song! I am 18 years old, and in the USA, I think that at this age, teenagers are starting to flow, ending high school, going to college, start partying, start studying, start everything. I run, the wind in my hair, my yarmulke flapping. And, you know, me and my friends, at the age of 18, are going to the army. Just like stopping your life. How was the tryout [for the navy]? How was what? How was the tryout? Yo, dude. I had a crazy tryout, it was crazy. Did they do that thing in the boat where they try to make you puke? Yeah, bro, I almost did. I was this close to puking. Who wants to fight? Who wants to be in a military system? No one. We all have a free soul that wants to do whatever it desires. But we need to be here in the army, so we'’re here. If we weren'’t here, we'd be overrun within two minutes. Damn it all! What'’s up? Take the surfboard. There is plenty to worry about when a kid goes to the army. You live with it. It'’s not easy, not simple. We worry whether he eats well, sleeps well, if he'’s okay, does he drink enough, is he out in the sun, you know, so he doesn'’t dehydrate or something. I'’m also very much a worrying type. It'’s my nature, and I knew I would find it difficult. Bottom line: It'’s really the family that keeps me going, even if they can sometimes be... -Tiring. -Annoying. Tiring. Come, David, come here. The main advantage of this room is that... this room is a '‘mamad'’-— a bomb shelter. And here, in Ashdod, it was critical. When there were sirens and missile alerts, I would sleep happily in my bed, and the siren would go off. I would hear it and be really happy to snuggle even deeper in bed. But my entire family had to run here and lock themselves in, hysterical. And here behind this glass window... we'’ve got... a piece of steel, basically. Sometimes we'’d hear explosions, too, most times. A missile once fell, say, [half a mile] away. It sounded like it exploded here in the parking lot. Crazy scary. So, today, we are actually celebrating Independence Day. And we'’re celebrating our freedom and life. Blessed are you, God, our Lord, King of the universe; who creates the fruit of the vine. Amen. Amen. Where did the bread go? So, how'’s the base? -Okay, you know. -Very basic. Well... All in all it'’s good. The million-dollar question. What do you want to know? What nuclear weapons do we have? What do you want to know about it? Hotdogs on Sunday, hotdogs on Monday, hotdogs on Tuesday, hotdogs with onions on Wednesday, -And the Friday night meal? -Ah, no, there'’s stir-fry. -Stir-fry? -Stir-fry, yeah. With hotdogs. Nah...joking. -We'’re very proud of him. All of his accomplishments. And I'’m very happy to see that Eden does think that he can make a change. And I hope that he will make a change. It'’s important that they know why they do everything. That they have the "“Why."” To love and understand what they do. That'’s the most important thing to me. And we'’re anxious because we don'’t want any harm to happen to him. Eden, my dear. My beloved child. The truth is... I'’m really worried. I'’m really worried. I want you to return to us in peace.That'’s all. Amen. Always. He'’s only 20. And he [has] a -— a lot of responsibility, for those kids: for their well-being. A lot. I don't know if -- I don'’t think I was able at his age to carry this load. Yeah. Right now, I sit quietly, and I try not to interfere... too much. If you'’re exposed for more than three seconds, you'’ll be killed by a sniper. It takes a sniper three seconds to locate you, and even if you'’re running, he'’ll take you down. Why don't we walk in the valley? What causes us to be exposed in the valley? -If they attack us from above. -Okay... The fun ended when this week started. It'’s become very... very rough; very real. Everything is new for them. To be outside, to sleep outside, to eat outside. -Grenade! -Grenade! Grenade! You were too crowded, you took too close to each other. I'’m starting to realize more and more what I'’m up to, what is about to come. I'’m going to protect my country. And when I feel it on my-—on my flesh, you know, everything, it'’s much... it'’s getting much [more] realistic, and... This is very complicated, you know? One minute I go-—I was- I was with my friends at the beach. I don'’t know, drinking beer, and now I'’m here; without cell phone, without anything. And... This is very complicated. Okay, what we'’re going to do now, divide up into pairs, and each pair needs to sneak up to the Commander Sergeant. -They'’re all going to the sides. -Yeah. How'’s that kid that you told us about, the Ethiopian one? -[Mekonen] Abeba? -Abeba, yeah. He'’s happy. He always has a smile on his face. I was born in a rural village in Ethiopia. We didn'’t come from a place of... pampering... or being pushed around in baby strollers... We were born and went straight out to the fields, and everyone was a shepherd. He immigrated here in 2007, if I'’m not mistaken. 2007? And 12 hours before they came to Israel, his father passed away over there. I dreamed and my parents dreamed, that we would be in Jerusalem. They told me we'’re different, we'’re Jews, we'’re different, our place is Jerusalem. Mekonen and I first met at [the pre-army training base] Michvei Alon, in the first base we were. We are both new immigrants. Stay close to me, Mekonen. Actually, I was born in Israel, and until the age of five I was in Israel. And then I moved to Switzerland. Maybe Mekonen and I are really close together, maybe because we are "“lone soldiers"” together. No, I think we can go from here. We have a lot in common. Even though-— even though we'’re coming from two different cultures, we have the same objective, we have the same part in common, we are Jewish. End of drill! Congratulations to the winners. My friend Mekonen, who won. My sweetie! Today we'’re in Jerusalem. Today they pledge to their country, and serving the army, and the... Jewish nation. Today you are going to say two words. Most of you will say, "“I swear."” Some, for one reason or another, will say, "“I declare."” and I'’m not sure how many of you understand the significance of the event. Myself, when I was sworn into the army, I didn'’t understand. My grandmother understood. I didn'’t understand. This day starts with... a bit of history, the background, their roots. You are going to connect to a long chain of generations that dreamed about you. Together protecting the people of Israel. Today you are going to say in Hebrew at the Western Wall by the Temple Mount: I swear. Jews all over the world pray for this moment. All the prayers toward the Temple Mount will be above you. I'’m going to give them [the] "“Why."” Why they are here, why they are in the army, why they are... living in Israel, why are we doing it. The values displayed here... comradeship, sticking to the mission and pushing for victory... These things weren'’t written here before. There was no IDF document or IDF values... It'’s ingrained in us, in the Jewish People. And I'’m going to tell them stories of the past, and I want them to connect to the stories and feel the stories. [This is the story of] Eitan. Eitan Nave. Eitan was a regular guy; like me, like you. He was a private. Here at Ammunition Hill [during the 1967 War], the Jordanians were throwing grenades, and from the bunkers here, throwing a grenade, a burst of fire; And Eitan, without thinking twice, jumps out of the trench, grabs his gun, and starts shooting upward. Eitan charges, going up, shooting. They advance. He shoots. They shoot. They advance. Eitan... got 30 bullets in his body. Eitan kept advancing and running. One bullet took him down. The 30th bullet. That was Eitan. They'’re only 18-year-olds. They don'’t yet get and understand what their mission is, and we'’re trying to tell them. It'’s a great day, and if they're going to forget the day, I'’ve failed. You need to know your past in order to... to live your future, to make a future, you know? I'’m enjoying this day. It means everything to me to be [at] the Kotel, the Wall of the Jews, and... I'’m really excited to begin this. -Excuse me? Are you in the 101? -Yes. Excuse me? Is Oren here? Oren...Oren...Oren... Have you seen him? Oh, you'’re his commander? When Oren [was] in [the training base]Michvei Alon, I was his commander. -Where is Oren? -He'’s coming soon; he'’s with his Mom. It'’s very important for me to stay in touch with all my soldiers. Tal, don'’t tell him I'm here, it'’s a surprise. It'’s very important to me to be here now. It'’s like closing a circle for me, and probably for him, too. I'’m not thinking about this-— What'’s up? When I was Oren'’s commander, I had to keep a professional distance from him. But now we have a friendly relationship. I was suspicious about this, but I didn'’t know what the surprise was about. Oren was... my best soldier. He loved this country, and he came from Switzerland, and he decided to come here, to Israel, and serve this country. He always said, "“I want... "“to be here, in Israel, in the army, to do something important."” He'’s an amazing soldier, and I'’m so excited to be here. Commanders, The people of Israel are entrusting to us their most beloved possession of all: their finest sons. Combat Soldiers: the path you have chosen is not an easy one, but it is filled with gratification, action, and glory. With unparalleled self-sacrifice, Today you are becoming part of a glorious chain of generations. I swear, pledge on my honor, to dedicate all my strength and even to give my life for the protection of the homeland, and the freedom of Israel. Two, Three: I Swear! Time'’s up. Attention, Commander! When the time'’s up, no one moves. No scratching, no questions. Straight line. Straight line. Neither of them has a pair. -Understood? -Yes, Commander! My name is Coral. I'’m a commander at a base called Michvei Alon. I'’m a commander for new immigrants. Hi, I'’m Yair, I'm from Peru, I live in Ashdod, and I'’m in Israel to study at university. I'’m Daniel Weiss, I'm Hungarian. Hi, my name is David. I emigrated to Israel from Russia. And why did you emigrate to Israel? To live; I love Israel. They come to Michvei Alon to learn Hebrew, but also my goal is to teach them-— before you are soldiers, before you know Hebrew, you should know how to be a good person. -What'’s your name? -Alex. From the moment they get to Michvei Alon I'’m their mother and father here. Okay. I didn'’t get to hear-—to see how you guys are doing, how it'’s going in the field, difficult, not difficult? I want to hear from you guys how it'’s going. Who wants to tell me? The food sucks, so... now I really miss my mom. My job-—beyond commanding them, helping them, and taking them through a certain process-— is also to connect them to the country. Jabotinsky had a famous saying: "“You can'’t have Zionism without... Jerusalem."” "“Zion."” Correct. Jerusalem. As a commander, it'’s very difficult to... to separate between the two worlds. On the one hand, to play my role in the army, and on the other hand, to go home and disconnect, because the two go together. How was your errands day yesterday? -Everything'’s okay, thank God. -Good. And my soldiers call me on the weekends, if there'’s a problem or something happens to them. Yes, it really is a bummer. Okay you'’ll be alright. I trust you to be strong, and [your parents] will come in two weeks. She loves these kids-—I call them kids, the recruits, she'’s been with them throughout this entire process. We really see how much she cares about each and every one of them. It'’s part of the job. It's not two worlds. [plays guitar] My entire life I was sheltered. I grew up as a spoiled child, I won'’t lie. Yes, Coral was really spoiled. It'’s so weird that you're a commander now. It'’s really weird. I remember in the beginning, when you said, "“Nah, I won'’t do the army, I'’ll go to college abroad..."” If you'’d spoken to me, say, six years ago, you would have heard me say things like, "“Why do we need to live in Israel?"” Or... "“Why work in Israel if I can get work abroad?"” When I got my soldiers-— soldiers who came from another country, who gave up everything in order to come here-— things I had to tell my soldiers made me ask questions myself. Developing my soldiers helped me develop myself. It'’s amazing how I got a job in the army which gets others to connect to something that I wasn'’t connected to. And it'’s from this place that I learned to connect to it. The stars of the kitchen. We are the-—we are the stars of the kitchen, a very difficult time, eh... You'’re training to be a fighter, and you'’re training also to do the kitchen, so... A man has to do what a man has to do. My hardest time in the kitchen, I made, like, 1500 pancakes. It'’s very hard to work in the kitchen, because the work never stops until I-— it can be until 11 PM. I never really wanted to know what a cook in the kitchen is. Eilon... He'’s a good soldier, he's a good soldier, but he... Sometimes he doesn'’t find his place, in the army. I imagine he was the clown at school. This isn'’t the place to be a clown. It'’s important to have fun and... and to laugh and smile all the time and all those things, but... but you need to know where to draw the line and be serious. We'’re working on it with him slowly, slowly. Mekonen, he'’s doing well. He just maybe had... some difficulties with his family. He has a lot of problems at home. So sometimes it'’s... You can see it; he has less energy doing... the physical exercises. He feels depressed. He'’s sad. We saw that Mekonen hadn'’t slept in four days. At night he was irritable, his head wasn'’t with us. He hardly ate. A week and a half ago, when we let him go home on leave, he called his commander and told him that he didn'’t want to return. It was then that we realized that the problem was really serious. Before he started the army, he had a really big debt, and while he was in the army, this debt grew. And what happened was that he had to return home to work so he could pay off this debt. His financial situation isn'’t that good, to say the least. There are 10 people living in a two-room apartment in Bnei Brak. He and his mom have been the main breadwinners at home. Hi! I'’m home! You don'’t kiss me? There are people at home, and one less person to support them. All of a sudden, all of the burden'’s on his mother. What can you do? She needs him. I worry about the child. It'’s the army. Because of the army, it'’s difficult. And I spoke to her about it. I told her, if you let him stay at home now and not go to the army and develop himself, then you'’ve sealed his fate. A soldier that finishes in a combat unit, has a lot of doors open for him in life. But, if Mekonen goes AWOL, the police will find him, and prosecute him. If we don'’t invest in him now, he will slip between our fingers. I won'’t be able to live with myself afterward, knowing that I could have saved him from... whether drugs or... all sorts of menial jobs. I couldn'’t live with it. 24/7 he sat and thought what to do about it. We worked in several directions. I made him come back to the army on Sunday; I convinced him. He came back, and... on Monday, the two of us went to the bank together. We spoke to debt collections together. In addition, we succeeded in finding a donation to cover his debts. Have you ever run long distances? Say, [6 miles]? [6], yes, maybe a bit more, yeah. And over a long distance, you know that you find the pace... -...and you continue with it? -Yeah. There are difficult moments, but we keep going, we don'’t give up. This is one of those difficult moments; you just need... someone to tell you to keep going; it will be fine. That'’s us. We're... the voice inside telling you, "“Mekonen, we'’re right here with you."” I just had a great phone call, and I want to share it with you. We were able to get a donation, and the donation will cover all of your debts. That should help you a bit. Will it help? Or... Yeah, for sure this will help a lot. I don'’t know what happened in the past, and it doesn'’t interest me. What interests me now is that you'’re with us, and that we'’re with you. And... Here... Here'’s the money, okay? What was beautiful was that the change was immediate. When we showed that we were willing to help him and he was willing for us to help him, the smile returned to his face. What is it? Thank you very much. The Jewish People, before anything else. For us, I told you... You'’re here. We'’re family now. I help you... like a little brother. I'’m glad it's working out. At the end of the day, I imagine that when I look back, I'’ll see this as one of the most meaningful moments of my life. Commander Ofir... There'’s a rumor that he's leaving us very soon, going to Officer'’s Course. They know I'’m leaving them. I always tell them, it'’s not relevant, making excuses, they know I'’m leaving them. I think it'’ll be a surprise for them to see Ofir "“break the distance"” with them. They'’ll be in shock, they won't know what hit them! When a commander leaves his soldiers, he breaks professional distance with them. And from that point on, they can become friends. Some commanders... like to make their soldiers sweat for it. Forward! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Everyone who gets here runs to the fence! It'’s called breaking the distance. Breaking the distance that we had with the commander. And he doesn'’t want that it will be only theory, also practical. We have to break it, we have to earn it. -Weapon ready! -Weapon ready! Under attack! -We'’re under attack! Fire! Fire! -Come on, fire! -Fire! Fire! Come on! Who'’s first? -I'’m not afraid of you! -Fire! Fire! Everyone stand facing the window, with your backs to the door. -Clear, everyone? -Yes, Commander Ofir! Back to the door, face toward the window. Everyone turn around. Hugs! Hugs! Hugs for everyone! -Who let Ofir out? -Who! Who who who! -Who let Ofir out? -Who! Who who who! Who told you [that I was leaving]? Everyone. Who didn'’t tell us? Parents, commanders... It'’s really difficult to change our [squad commander] because our [squad commander] was everything for us. And he knew everything, and he helped us [with] everything, also. Here I come! He'’s a great commander, I like him, and... he understands me. Mekonen, you'’re not normal. I was really down today because you are leaving. What is this, a serenade, Mekonen? This was today? It was at lunch. Make room, make room. Listen closely, just before I leave. It'’s very simple, okay? Don'’t forget, don't ever forget what you'’re doing here. Okay, even if your knees hurt. Every time someone feels down, bummed, like, "“They didn'’t give me a day off for errands..."” Okay? You'’ll call me, send me a message, I'’m here for you 24/7. The entire world; you'’re my entire world. -Okay, you got it, guys? -Yes. -Got it? -Yes, Ofir! There was no distance with you from the start so it doesn'’t change anything. I'’m going to miss you, you have no idea how much! I'’m going to miss you... Only he gets a hug? No way, I want one, too! Alon! This is a kid I like... Now we are in the '‘imun mitkadem.'’ It'’s called the advanced training. It'’s something much more difficult. Fire, fire, fire! You don'’t sleep. You don'’t eat a lot. -Fire! -Fire! This is a little larger than me. It'’s more than I can carry, that'’s for sure. I'’m telling you, each second, seriously, each guy [here] has this war inside him, and it'’s saying, "“I don'’t want to do this."” And the guy who'’s saying, "“Even though you don'’t want to do this, you have to do this."” I asked my friend if I should put the mats down here for us to sleep. He said, Yeah, it looks like a good spot."” I said, "“Are there ants here, or anything?"” He looks, in the dark... "“It looks fine."” And we'’re sleeping, I started having nightmares, such nightmares. I was simply imagining something was chewing on me. One sec, I still have an ant'’s head stuck to me. Crazy red ants. And then I woke up covered in ants. I'’m really short-handed right now. I'’ve got no commanders at all. Shit! Can I say that? Sorry. But it'’s not good. I miss him [Ofir]. I had no energy to do anything here, and I was weak, without Commander Ofir. Right now I'’m doing my job, and their job, like three [commanders'’] jobs. -Weapon...reload! -Weapon...reload! It'’s hard. I'm not sleeping and I'’m not eating. It'’s not good. Come on first squad, with energy! Begin live fire drill! Matan, move your fire team to the left! Eden is under a ton of pressure. Now he'’s being tested. Eden also has incredibly high expectations, really, more than other commanders. And this puts him under a lot more pressure. Don'’t shoot until you're in a straight line. You'’re shooting diagonally! Charge! Alon! Straight line, look... You'’re not straight... The drill was... a disaster, really bad and... it'’s too bad it was like that. Roll again! Another roll. Malul! Malul! Malul! Malul, what are you doing?! Back, to the right, come on! If they'’re not in a straight line, [they] can shoot each other. It'’s really dangerous. Malul, your strip is here! No, straight, to the barrels! Malul, where are you going? Like this! End of drill! End of drill, weapons at 60 degrees! Come over here, quickly! Weapons at 60 degrees! You have a bullet in the chamber! What'’s with you guys? You'’re waving your gun around in the middle of a drill?! Shooting outside the boundaries?! Put your weapons down now! What'’s with you guys? You want to kill someone here?! It was very dangerous. It went through my head for a second that I might have to go to someone'’s funeral tomorrow, so for a second... You almost shot Zerkavod in the back! It was very close! Get a grip! What happened here was not in order, not at all! At all! It'’s all on his shoulders, and the commanders put everything on him. There'’s a feeling sometimes that... I can'’t do this. I can'’t. First off, I would say, "“I can'’t do it."” But... this isn'’t what'll break me, these things. But it'’s part of the responsibility, to worry about everyone. Hi! There'’s breakfast waiting for us. Good, that'’s always good. And remind me when the final march is, because I want to come to Jerusalem. The 17th of October. Okay, good. So I'’ll...even if I don'’t have... Even if I have work, I'’ll take a day off. Okay? I'’m coming. It'’s the same as last time, though. What does it matter? I want to see you. Okay. Hey, I deserve it, I'’m your mom, too. True. Okay, nice. I can'’t believe I'm saying this. I'’m actually happy I'’m doing his laundry, because- I don'’t know- just maybe touching his clothes and, you know, so it'’s kind of emotional. I mean, even a dirty T-shirt suddenly has meaning to it, you know? We'’re so happy that they come home and they come home safe, that we'’re willing to do anything, just, you know? Just that they- as long as they'’re safe. Mom, is there anything to eat? -What, what? -Is there food? What do you want to eat? Food. What do you want to eat? When he was in third grade, if somebody told me he was going to be an officer in paratroopers, I'’d laugh hysterically. I'd have thought somebody was telling me a sick joke, you know? I just didn't believe it. He was a very difficult child. I was afraid that he was going to wind up to be a juvenile delinquent, because he could be. The experiences I remember are... bad experiences, in a sense. Experiences like throwing chairs at my classmates, and you try to steal things, and you try this, and... He was also always accident-prone. Things like, I'’d break my arms, I would fall a lot, and each time they would take me to the hospital, and so on... They'’d look at me with the same face every time, "“What now, Eden?"” "“What did you do this time?"” He'’s had a lot to overcome. I couldn'’t read very well, and my writing was even worse; to this day I don'’t... No one understands what I write. He couldn'’t read... or write, I think, until... eighth grade, basically. We already- We already did testings for him and we realized that he was ADD, along with dyslexic, but really serious dyslexia. And dysgraphic. And it eats you up inside because you can'’t do one plus one, and it drives you crazy. And you get upset, you get upset at your parents and you yell at them. It eats away at you, the feeling of... being unsuccessful. There were times that I... I gave up on myself. I was a bit heavy and chubby. I don'’t know how to explain it, but it'’s... you feel different, you feel less valuable. So initially they sent me to a psychologist. And what did I tell the psychologist? I would tell him, "“I don'’t know what you want from me."” Like, "“Leave me alone."” He had to learn to trust people. He had to learn to trust us. I wanted something better for him, and I- and I wanted him to come to his full potential. We lived in Ashdod, and then we moved here, to Kfar Vradim. It'’s a different environment, you see trees instead of houses. It affects how... how you want to be at the end of the day; you'’ve got time to think. In the city you'’ve got no time to think. He went to a new school. He went to this open school here in Tefen, and they totally understood him. Suddenly, within one year, he was, like, at the top of his class, doing all types of things. So the school was a very big factor. And I was trying to get him interested in running since he was, I think, in fifth grade, because I read articles that pointed out that you can overcome learning disabilities and attention-span problems by running. I said to him, "“Well, if you want a girl, you'’ve got to lose weight."” So he says to me, he says, "“Okay."” He said, "“We'’ll go running."” Don'’t follow me, don't follow me, don'’t follow me! Sooner or later, he began outrunning me. He was too fast. And I felt as if he had really good potential. I started running, and I really enjoyed it. A lot of it is from my mom. She inspired it since she was training. And then, you start running [one mile], and then [two miles] and then [three], and then... and then they look at you differently. Suddenly people look at me differently. You can hit on girls, and girls can hit on you, which is all that matters to you at that age... It'’s significant. He also found out that he was really good at running, and he began winning medals: first, second, third place. He was among the best. He got a... bronze medal at the Maccabiah for a [three mile] race, which is like- I mean, it'’s amazing! At a certain point you stop giving up on yourself, and you demand more from yourself. Eden is aware of other people'’s difficulties because he'’s been through it. My parents didn'’t give up, so I don'’t want to give up on my soldiers. Yeah, bro? We'’re on our way, just a few minutes, okay? It was Mekonen. He'’s already worrying that I'm not coming to his house. I don'’t think he... invites everyone. It'’s a little bit, like, an honor to be invited by Mekonen'’s house. What'’s up, bro? Everything'’s great. What'’s up? What'’s up, bro? Everything okay? How nice. Thanks! You know I wanted Ethiopian food. What'’s this? Nah, nah, what... They said it'’s really spicy; I said okay. Answer it; answer it. What'’s up, ya shit? I'’m at Mekonen's now. He'’s making an omelette. Bro, I'’m flying to Switzerland tomorrow. I'’m not coming back. Joking, I'’m coming back, okay? What do you think? If you don'’t bring chocolate, I'’ll kill you! I want chocolate. A lot! Here is my room. Much better than the army, I think. So, here we have the balcony. The Swiss landscape. You see all the mountains here? I climbed it already and... I really miss this. So, son... what are you looking at there? I thought you were on Facebook, for a change. Fifty percent of the time I'’m on Facebook. I'’m very proud. He'’s my youngest. And we have fun together every time we see each other, and... this I miss. This I miss today. And he'’s leaving us in 48 hours, and it'’s going to be tough. Maybe the main thing, why I wanted to leave Switzerland, is because I feel much more useful in Israel than in Switzerland. In Switzerland, they don'’t really need me. They don'’t really-—they absolutely don'’t need me. But, in Israel, you have this duty that you have to defend also the country. You have to defend the people. I feel much more useful... for now, that [at] my age, I think Israel needs me and not Switzerland. Good day, Madame. Actually, it'’s... my life is a double life. I feel Israeli and Swiss. You live all your life in Switzerland, everything about you is Swiss, your mentality. You like the same things, you like to drink the same things, you like the same type of girls, you have exactly the same mentality as any Swiss person. But your nature will always be Jewish, and you will always be different from the Swiss people and the Europeans. Have a nice day. Thank you. Goodbye, Sir and Madame. Yes, Jew, Jew! My little beloved Jew! I missed you! Man, you are beautiful, beautiful! Well, I respect his choice [to enlist], but it worries me, I got worried. I said to myself, shit! He'’s gonna get killed. Now he'’s here. Even though my friends didn'’t understand this, for me it was more important to go to Israel. Oh, yeah! Don'’t hurt me! Yes, I'’m going to hurt you. I want to see effort, professionalism, precision, and discipline. Discipline! Right now, we are at the Marom base. We'’re practicing parachuting for the jump. Two, three. The person taking Eden'’s place here as commander is the unit instructor. Jump! Those female commanders... We'’re not too scared of them. They'’re really sweet. I hope she doesn'’t overhear me. I have a really tough unit instructor. At the beginning, we were really afraid, actually, because it'’s... it'’s frightening, because we'’re falling, and we have to fall correctly. If you don'’t fall correctly, it'’s hurting you. Get up. Oren, you landed with legs apart. Again? Yes. It really hurts, you'’ve got no idea, bro. All my muscles are hurting. It actually sat well around my crotch, but... my butt is broken. No, Mekonen, that wasn'’t good, no, get up. I'’m afraid of heights, because... I came from a place on the ground. I'’ve never been high up. And suddenly now, to go up high and... which is the total opposite of me, and to jump, is a bit... different and... not normal at all. When I have to jump, I'’m going to be so excited. I'’ll be really nervous. The adrenaline is going to be coursing though my body like crazy. But we'’ll jump. And if we don'’t jump, they'll push. The plane is already on its way here. You'’ll hear this noise. Here it is. Where? There. Damn! Yup, that'’s it. Right door, equipment check! Equipment check! Wow! Breathe deeply! Amazing! It'’s so frightening, we were so frightened, first of all. When you see, like, all the guys jumping, and you'’re like the only guy standing in the plane. It'’s your turn, three seconds, and like, saying, "“Jump!"” Oh, it was amazing. It was soft, it was amazing, everything was good... What'’s up, Dad? I jumped, that'’s it. Did you get it on camera? Listen, it was crazy! This is so worth it, you have no idea! Ah, Mekonen! It was good. You don'’t understand. One of the best things. It'’s the craziest thing I've ever done. Really, really fun. We'’re in the middle of the War Week, it'’s called. The main focus of this week is making sure the company is ready for war. In the end, you don'’t have to be... the head of military intelligence in order to understand there are a lot of things happening around us that could explode. It'’s enough for there to be one fool in Syria or Lebanon to start a war. Charge! They simply haven'’t dealt with a situation like this... where the country is between life and death. This is a switch, it seems to me, that they made last week, where they understood that the fate of the country is in their hands. Permission to fire? Permission granted. Go on, go on, fire! No one wants to be here. You think I want to be here? I want to go to the beach. But we need to be here, so we'’re here. This feeling of being surrounded by all... our enemies, in the middle of everything. We grew up in the midst of this. It'’s not as if one day it became like this. My parents also grew up with this feeling. That'’s it. That's what we'’re here for-to defend our country. Honestly; not to capture territory and not... I'’m simply protecting my country, within my country'’s borders. And that'’s it. After all, we'’ve got guys who are 18 years old. Their parents... want them to return safely. In a war, I know it'’s impossible for me to guarantee... that this will happen. And certainly I think it'’s a big responsibility, and... it crosses, it crosses my mind. Today we have a group coming to Jerusalem, to Mt. Herzl, which is the biggest cemetery of soldiers in Israel. the second time I came here to Mt. Herzl was after I was finished with my military service. I came after my release. After the... military service. Three of my friends are buried here. I couldn'’t continue living as if everything was okay. As if, "“Okay, whatever, establish a family, career!"” How can you? Three friends remain 20, as time passes by. A soldier who comes to the cemetery needs to deal with the understanding that you might be the next one who'’s going to be here. And now I want you to look at Alexei, who is here. Alexei was a soldier at Michvei Alon. he emigrated from Russia, and died in battle, here in Israel. The conflict is this: On one hand I want them to go and be combat soldiers, and give all of themselves, because I know how important it is; I'’m part of it, too On the other hand... How far... where do you draw the line? Sadly, there were a lot of wars, and a lot of soldiers who died, or us to have a state today. I don'’t even know how to thank those who fell in the past, True. so that we can sit here like this. There'’s no need to talk about this now. If this happens, God forbid... I'’m just saying, I don't know if I will have the chance to say things like this again, but I am saying that you need... I expect you to continue forward, I don'’t expect you to get stuck... and to mourn forever and to wear black all day and to be sad and all that. On the contrary, continue onward. And understand that this is the price we need to pay. And to understand that this is the mission. There'’s nothing that you can do. This is what must be done. I'’m standing here by the grave of Eliraz [Peretz]. Eliraz was killed in 2010. Two brothers from the same family. At the unveiling of Eliraz'’s gravestone, and with this we'’ll conclude, their mother says, "“You can'’t return my children. "“You can'’t give me back my two sons. "“But how can we keep them alive? "“Take one of my son'’s positive traits. "“Live with it. And he will live on through you. That you'’ll continue to protect the country; that you'’ll be optimistic. We'’re not sanctifying death. Rather, we'’re sanctifying life. You, us, all of us together are a people. We need to learn about our nation in order to value it. If you don'’t learn, you won't know who we are. New Entry Has anyone asked himself why we put a stone on a grave? Even [stone, in Hebrew] is spelled alef, bet, nuhn. Alef is for abba [father], bet is for ben [son], nuhn is for neched [grandchild]. It points to our continuity; that those people who died? We won'’t forget them. Today we'’re leaving what has become their home for the last eight months. This is basically the end of the beginning. By this time next week, they'’ll find themselves protecting the northern border of Israel. Wow, it'’s crazy mixed feelings. On one hand, we'’re excited to be done here. On the other hand, happy; it'’s a new beginning. Today they'’re going on the final march. They'’ll find themselves walking for 16 hours with between [45 and 65 pounds] of gear on them. Ouch, my back! It'’s crazy, it's about [40 miles] with gear. The paratroopers do it with gear. Okay, it'’ll be fun. It'’s going to be nasty. It'’s going to be really nasty. This march is the ultimate test for the platoon. And if he won'’t finish, he won'’t be a paratrooper. I want everyone to complete it together, to deal with their difficulties, and be able to handle them. And to finish it. I believe everyone here can finish... even those whose legs hurt... they can all do it. Let'’s go! Now they'’re... more conscious of what they'’re doing. They'’re not going for no reason; not a single person here is going without a reason. Come on, get close together, there'’s an incline. Push! Push each other! Come on! -Push! -Come on! Very good, very good! Come on! We'’re together. And when there is a problem, we'’re together. And this is beautiful. No one is alone. Because this is the people of Israel. To think we walked what, 12, 13 hours? And there are still [four miles] with the stretcher. I'’m finished; I have no strength for this. I can'’t stand. I don't know how I'’m standing now. Wow. I'’m dead, bro. I have no strength to get up. Come, bro. Let'’s get up- complete it like men. I want to, bro, but what do I do about the blister? It burst, bro! It hurts! I can'’t believe it. Wait, wait. Give me your hand. Can you make it? We need another stretcher. Come on, behind every stretcher, make two lines. Lift them up to your shoulders. Chin up, forget about all your pains. Sixty years ago, there were battles here in Jerusalem for the liberation of Jerusalem. And now you'’re here, you with this stretcher, here in Jerusalem. We'’ll enter, with our chests out, standing tall, as if we have just begun the march. And most importantly, keep on smiling, because no matter what, no one will take away your smile. Once a paratrooper, always a paratrooper. Eilon... He'’s a special soldier. He grew up. It was really hard for him... and he didn'’t quit. Oren... I really appreciate that he left everything to move to this country. To be a Lone Soldier is not simple at all. The Jewish People mean everything; it means my life. And... everything is turning around for the Jewish People. Mekonen... He'’s the spirit of the platoon. What his family is going through without him there, and the financial debts. I love him so much because he successfully puts this all aside in order to be the best soldier that he can be. I see him as an example for every soldier. No, no, I didn'’t know that I was going to receive my Commander Tom'’s beret, but... you know, it'’s an honor. "“The Jewish People"” is something tangible. "“The Country"” is something tangible. And the "“Jewish People?"” It'’s not a uniform, and it's not your rank, and it'’s not who you are or what you are. It'’s your Judaism. It'’s the spirit. And this is the spirit that'’s been with us for more than 2,000 years. And it impacts the whole world.
