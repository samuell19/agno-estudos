Shut your ugly, old time, ancient ass up! (laughing) If you say one more word to me, I'll have that lady take one of her titties and beat the shit out of you. And I ain't lying either! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. I am what I am and I'm gonna be the very best of what I am. And for those who don't like me confidentially, I don't give a damn. I'd like to thank you for letting me be myself, thank you! (jazzy piano music) Ladies and gentlemen, Petey! Petey, Petey Wheatstraw! (cheering) How did we do tonight, Jimmy? Over the boat, Pete, things looks good, brother We gotta hurry 'cause we got a plane to catch. Take me with you, Petey. Oh Sheila, we've been through this many times, you know the score, baby. Sheila, baby, you know how it is with us honey, you've got to hang on in there. You're gonna see that Nell bitch, ain't ya? Oh Sheila, listen, you know the business, baby, I'll send for you next week. And what about Nell? What about Nell, baby, you know it's only me and you! Sheila, baby, don't be so uptight, I'll see that you get a plane ticket next week. Hey Petey, beautiful man, really good this time, we got to do it again real soon. Y'all take it slow, Jimmy, it was a pleasure. Don't mean to run, but I got something planned for me, takin' off. Hang in there, doc. Okay y'all, let's get out of here. I hope this little business adventure turns out the way it's supposed to. 100 grand is a lot of money and this place doesn't look like it holds over 200 people. This is not it. We got a place over on the East side that holds over 2,000 people. And I guarantee you this'll be the biggest show to hit this city in quite some time. With the kind of cash that you just loaned us, we can't miss! Right, Skillet? Right! We've checked out all the risks very carefully. Mr. White, we're gonna give you a 20% return on all your money. You won't be sorry. No siree. I hope not. For that kind of money the company can get a little ugly. But for some reason I think it's gonna work. Soft season, all the good acts are on the road. With that kind of money you'll be able to advertise and pull 'em in. Now are you sure no one's coming into town? Mr. White, stop worrying. We have no competition for at least three or more months from now, right Skillet? Happy times are right around the corner. (laughing) Mr. White, you about to become the luckiest investor of the century. (laughing) Yeah, or lose and become the most dangerous man in town. (dramatic music) Dangerous for you guys that is. I'll keep in touch. Keep the faith. (laughs) And keep the bankroll. Skillet, let's get started. Yeah, let's get started. (laughs) Madam Wright, come on over here. Listen, we need singers. We need musicians, we need dancers. Lookie here, the kind of money we got, we can do some booking. - We gonna party now! - [Man On Right] That's right! We living, brother! Living? Living? Living between the sky and the Earth and ain't touching dirt nowhere! Nowhere! (laughing) (funk music) Yeah, that song so good, and I'm your daddy, The Hitman, on XERA Radio! Moving right along, as we told you earlier, it's celebrity time. The one and only Mr. Excitement himself, Petey Wheatstraw, what's happening man? I'm glad to be back in town. You know I'm opening at Steve's Den with my all girls toy show. Hey I know it's gonna be a good show. Tell us about this 'cause I know it's gonna be a right all situation. All I can say is to the people out there in radio land I want to see your face in the place and your feet under the seat so you can put some zip in your hip and slide in your glide. [Voiceover] Big fat girl strutting in there but oh! Just a minute baby. And that's June 15th at Steve's Den. I'll talk to you later, baby. [Voiceover] Be there! [Skillet] Our opening night?! The 15th? (whimpering) Leroy! Leroy! I gotta talk to you, partner. Man, you made me blow my damn shot! Wait a minute! I just learned on the radio Petey Wheatstraw is in town. You what?! He's gonna open show there on June the 15th! Leroy, we can't stand up to competition, he'll kill us for sure. Remember what Mr. White said about his money. if we don't pay him back? We dead, partner, what are we gonna do Leroy? What we gonna do? Shut up and let me think! What you got up your sleeve, partner? Wait, I'll call Petey on the phone. See if I can get him to postpone. Dig it. And if that don't work, there's other ways to make him give in. Get Willy on the phone quick! I'll get him on the phone. Rack man, rack 'em up! Well Steve, you got the joint looking good, but you still ain't done shit with that small dressing room, you know Petey don't like no small dressing room, man. Damn right, that dressing room ain't big enough to fart in. You didn't come here to fart or shit, you came here to do your thing! But your dressing room still looks like a shit house! I got it looking like a shit house because of one reason, Petey, let me tell you. The way a person shit tells if they have love or larceny. See, people that have love in their heart, they sit down and they shit. (trills tongue) Reach for the toilet paper, wipe that shitty ass, and then they flush it down. (laughing) People that have larceny, they sit down and they shit (trills tongue), wipe that shitty ass, but because they have larceny, before they flush it down, they have to turn around and peep at that shit. (all laughing) Anybody don't trust their own asshole must have larceny. And it still looks like a shit house, can you dig it? Let me say this, Petey. We got the posters ready, and man we are ready to roll this weekend. Steve, you mean to tell me you haven't got the posters up and we getting ready to open next week? Well never mind all that Petey. Anyway, I put my boy right over there. Can I help, Ted? No Larry, you'd just be in the way. Oh Ted, you haven't seen your brother in four months, why don't you let him come along? Come on, T. Okay, you can help. I'll go and get changed and we'll get started. Matter of fact I'll kick in a few bucks for the little man. What? Steve, you are volunteering to pay somebody? Don't you be so cold on my man. Oh baby, don't worry about it, they only kidding. Petey, why don't y'all drink up man, my lady's fixin' to poo, we got to get on out of here. Let's drink a toast to a successful engagement. [Voiceover] Hey, stop! God damn! These dope-headed junkies make me sick! That's why niggers in the ghetto can't have shit! Hey you, get back! (fast-paced jazz music) (tires peal) (horn blaring) (crash) Jimmy, you should do something, help him! I got the money, what the hell you think I can do, I can't take those damn junkies! (fast-paced jazz music) (girls screaming) Shit! (cracking) Come on, nigger, scram, man! Come on! Come on, fight it! (yelping) Y'all got a lot of nerve messing with my car. Penny addict junkies, that's all you are. You'll take from your mama, you'll even take the limbs off of a tree! But I'm gonna kick your ass for messing with me. (fast-paced jazz music) (loud whimpering) (screaming) All right, you clowns, up on your feet. You going back to my car and putting my shit back just like you found it! All right, let's go! All right, move! (laughing) (sproinging) Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to remember their faces so you can know who's breaking into your places! If they do it to me, they'll do it to you! So I want you to stick your foot up their ass the next time they do! (cheering) (easy going music) But Leroy, what we gonna do? If he's gonna put on a show-- Shut up! I'm trying to think! - Willie! - [Willie] Yeah, boss? I want you to keep an eye on - Petey and his boys. - [Willie] Right. I wanna know every move they make day and night. Take some of the boys and call me every hour on the hour. Right. Castro, Brian, let's go. But Leroy! If he's gonna put on a show-- You said that already! He's probably staying at Nell's place. We'll call him. Maybe we can get him to change his mind. Change his mind? After what we did to Petey? He'll come through that phone and strangle us. Petey knows the score now. He's on our terrain now. All we gotta do is put a little pressure on him, he'll yield. Leroy, I don't think-- Don't think! Just get Nell on the phone. I wanna talk to Petey. ♪ Loving you ♪ Touching you ♪ It's always on my mind ♪ Thinking of kisses on you Look, what is it with you, Petey? Don't I even turn you on a little?

May not even be as bad as I think it is. (phone rings) Shit. Hello? Yes, just a second. It's for you, now don't be long. Baby, this is gonna be the shortest phone call in Bell Telephone's history. Can you dig it? Mmmhm. Petey, how you doing, brother? Don't brother me, you no business barn rat soup eatin' son of a bitch! I want you and that fat slob partner of yours to pay me the money ya'll owe me! (laughs) That's exactly what I was calling you for. I want to pay you back, but on one condition. Condition my ass! It's y'all that owe me! I will condition you, I'll put my foot up you and that big bear's ass both! Look Petey, Skillet and I are in a bad position. You see, we want you to postpone your engagement for a few months. We borrowed a big piece of money and we can't afford your competition. You have the nerve to call me and ask me to cancel my engagement! I wouldn't stop my show if you needed ice water in hell! So that's the way you wanna play, huh nigga? Well you know two of us can play that, you hear? Why you. What was that all about? Nell, listen, I want you to call Jimmy and the boys because the shit look like it's done hit the fan.

If Jabbar didn't then I won't neither. My man! Now I want you to go inside and tell mama I'll be a little late and not to wait up for me. Okay. Swish. Two points.

Petey Wheatstraw. Who are you, man? My card. Lou Cipher? A small mistake on the part of the printer. Actually it's pronounced Lucifer. Are you responsible for all this madness? In most cases I am, but in this particular instance I happened to walk upon this disaster. You may stand up. (tremulous tones) Where am I? Where am I? Where am I at? Your new home, Petey, if everything works out well. Well if you're wondering, Petey, you're quite dead. And what about all of these other people? Are they? The ones that have been shot, yes. The others are, you might say, out to lunch. But what do you want from me, man? My my, you're quite direct. I like that. She will like that too. She who? We'll talk about that later. Your problem seems to be right now. I have a proposition to offer you, Petey, are you willing to listen? Your propositions you always wind up on top. Just like the shit that you done to Adam and Eve. Oh Petey, I was young then. My salad days. My style today is much more sophisticated. Well what do you want from me now? A son. A son? (laughs) You got to be sick! How in the hell can I give you a son? By simply marrying my daughter. What's in the deal for me, man? Gaze upon the root of all this madness as you put it. (twinkling) Well? You don't have to worry about Petey no more, boss. He's resting in peace. Good. Now that he's resting in peace, we can rest in peace too. (laughing) Lively times! (laughing) Happy times! Happy times, yeah. (laughing) Leroy and Skillet. I knew it was them two big fat slobby son of a bitches! Yes, they felt threatened by your upcoming show in town. Well why kill a little boy like that in cold blood? If you would just calm down a moment and listen, perhaps we can work things out. I'm listening. Marry my daughter and give her a child. And I will arrange it for you to have your life back. To strut and fret your hour upon the stage again. Revenge will be yours, Petey Wheatstraw. No, this is madness man, you got to be sick. Well Petey, prepare to die. (gong chimes) [Bantu] Let your wisdom be your weapon. Wisdom, wisdom, wisdom. All right. I'll marry your daughter and give her this son that you need so badly. By the way, what does your daughter look like? Gee, I hope beauty has nothing to do with our proposition. (laughing) Oh hell no, man, uh uh. No no no, I won't marry her, deal or no deal. Kill me, man, kill me, uh umm. Yes, my daughter's quite unfortunate. Very well, Petey. [Bantu] Wisdom, wisdom. All right, I'll marry her. You'll be hearing from me from time to time. It will be as though none of this ever happened. (eerie tones) (rapid gunfire) (screaming) [Preacher] And the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. The Lord is my sheperd. I shall not want. [Voiceover] (sobs) Oh Lord, my baby. Petey, how could that be, I know-- Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, don't worry about it, I'll explain it to you later. Thank you, dear. That's the way it was. I'm not lying. That's some crazy shit, isn't it? Crazy, yeah, but man you making a deal with the Devil. You know how things like that turn out. And anyway, I think I'd rather be dead than marry someone ugly as that! The main thing man, I'm still alive. Now listen, I can figure out a way to keep from marrying the Devil's daughter, but the main thing we've got to deal with Leroy and Skillet right now. But Petey, I'm scared. Now you know how powerful the Devil is, and if you cross him, he's gonna be mad as hell. I mean heaven. Oh shit. Oh Nell, you always worry, now you know I can take care of things. Ted! Ted! Are you all right? Man, I ain't gonna rest until I settle with Scarface Willie. (suspenseful music) Right this way, ladies. (whistles) It's that little punk again. Come on, chump! Come on! We'll fix his ass for keeps it this time. Come on! Hey man, come on, come on! Thought you would've done learned your lesson by now, little brother. Guess you one of them hard-headed niggers. (exclaiming) Hold it, Bruce Lee! See now you too dangerous to have around. I'm gonna arrange it so you can be with Petey and your kid brother for all time! Start praying, pal! (screaming) What's the matter, Willie, the cat got your tongue?! I oughta make you eat this gun! But I thought-- Yes, tell your boss I'm still alive and I'm mad as a hornet in a bumblebee hive! (flatulating) I want you to tell your boss that his days is numbered and his luck is bad! So son of a bitch, (mumbles)! Now get your ugly ass on! Get! Move! Why didn't you let me finish him? Oh Ted, there will be revenge on all of them for you, don't worry about it. Let's make it. Willie, you sure it was him? You're sure you got him? Well how in the hell can he still be alive? Maybe he missed him. I know he was dead. Nobody could've stood the lead we pumped into him, nobody! I swear, Leroy! I saw him get hit too, boss. He must've took about four or five slugs. Well how in the hell can he still be out there walking around? Somebody tell me! What we gonna do, Leroy? Shut up and let me think! I gotta think. Phew, this is killing me! Let him think, everybody, let him think. (groaning) What happened to him? I think Willie's smell was too much for him. I think I'm gonna pass out too. Willie, you get your stinkin' ass out of here! Get out of here and go clean up! And get back here on the double! (playfully sorrowful music) Somebody open a window or something, damn. I've got it! Well come on with it. He lives in Nell's place. Right. We never did finish our little party the other night, and now we're all alone and there's no one here to bother us, so I'll just take the phone off the hook. (phone rings) Well I'll be damned. Hello? Yes, just a second. It's for you, now don't be long. Yes Petey, there's two things I neglected to tell you. One, you will have powers beyond your wildest dreams. All you have to do is use my magical cane. It contains all of my secrets. Two, you must be careful where and how you use it. It will serve every purpose you will ever need. All you have to do is wield the cane, Petey, and my power is yours. Well thanks for calling, Lou. Well who's Lou? Don't worry about it, baby, let me introduce you to a friend of mine. Oh at last, I'm gonna put something on you you won't forget. (laughing) (mumbles) (screaming) (crashes) (yelling gibberish) [Nell] Stop it! You guys are tearing up my place! Police! Get away from me!

Just a little further. - Petey! - (groaning) Listen, listen! I don't hear nothing, man. Well I hear something, listen. (moaning) Come on, man, I don't hear nothing. (moaning) That's it Pete!

Get that shit down from there, and what are you doing? Move that out from over there! Let's get moving! Hey boss! Hello! (laughing) Mr. White!

Don't try and sell me, sell tickets. [Skillet] Oh they selling by the hundreds Mr. White, by the hundreds. Good. Now what about this Wheatstraw character? I understand he's opening a show nearby. Now I hope he's no competition to you guys. No siree, Mr. White. We already killed-- Uh, what my partner's trying to say, we've killed the idea of Mr. Wheatstraw opening a show here. See, he's a friend of ours. Okay fine. Hold five tickets for me and my friends, front row. We'll announce you too, Mr. White. Nothing's too good for you and your friends, nothing's too good. Maybe this is a good deal after all. The wife will love it. She goes for stuff like this. Well I'll see you guys tomorrow night at the opening. Oh, and break your legs. (laughing) He likes to make jokes. Oh Leroy. If Petey opens the show, we dead, partner, we dead, you know that. If I had good people around working, Petey would've been out the way a long time ago. Boss, I'm telling you, he's got some kind of power or something. I mean-- Boss, you know I don't believe in that kind of shit either, but it's true, it's weird. Don't give me that supernatural shit!

And $13.42 in the other pocket. $13.42 cents in the other pocket. What would you have? I'd have on somebody else's pants, they sure wouldn't be mine. (laughing and applause) Do it now, Petey, do it now. Uncross your legs whitey, you gonna choke your fool self to death. (crowd gasps) (suspenseful tones) Leroy! What's the matter with you? I don't know, Skillet. I opened my mouth and it just came out. Sorry folks, I hope you didn't get offended. My partner gets carried away a little bit at a time. (chuckles) Speaking of carrying away, they should carry this bitch away sitting on that blue satin bedsheet. What's the matter, mama, you think a nigger don't know a bedsheet when he see one? (gasping and murmuring) [Skillet] Leroy! You gonna get us killed, man! I really don't know what's happening. It's working, Petey, it's working. Sorry, folks.

Sound like they're tearing the place apart. (thunder booms) (loud pops and explosions) What's goin' on in there? Where's the key? Where is it?

You mean you gonna walk off and leave like that? I wanted to honey, but I gotta make this meeting, see you later. Hey baby, what's happening? [Voiceover] Oh hi, hun. How you doing?

Look, I'll call you back, okay? Yes, Nell? A man came by here looking for you. A man? What was his name? Well he left his card. It was right there, I don't know what happened to it. Well what did he look like? A weirdo. Shit, that's all I've been running into since I've been in here, is weirdos, one after another. Well this one was really strange, he wouldn't tell me what he wanted. Nell, I've got to get my act together for the opening, I'm going upstairs and rehearse. I don't want to see anyone. Well I'll make sure you are not disturbed. Thanks Nell. [Nell] You're welcome. Good afternoon, Petey, there's no need for that. It's me. Lou. Oh Lou. How have you been? I've been fine, Petey. I saw your heroic act today. The little boy. He was mine you know. You shouldn't use that cane so loosely. Well it was lying around doing nothing, so I thought I would put it to some use. You haven't forgotten our deal, have you Petey? I've kept up my end of the bargain, now it's your turn. I wouldn't miss it for the world. I'm looking forward to it. Good. Then prepare yourself for the wedding. Tomorrow. Why so soon? I came to your aid soon. Don't you think one good deed deserves another? Where's this wedding gonna take place? Down there of course. Incidentally, you can give me the cane. I need this cane for another day. Okay, Petey. I suppose it'll be all right. Just as long as you don't interfere with any of my actions. Don't have to worry. I won't give you any trouble. Very good. I'll pick you up tomorrow night about 11:30. I'll be waiting, Lou. Or should I say Father? It doesn't matter! Just marry her so I can rest. Goodbye, Petey. Goodbye, Father. (wind howls) (phone buzzes) Petey, how did that man get in there? I've been right here all day. Just call Jimmy and get him on the phone, I'll explain later. Look like the shit is gonna hit the fan. Petey, who was that man? That's Lucifer, ol' Satan himself. (gasps) I knew it! I could feel something strange about him. Petey, what are you gonna do? Nell don't ask so many questions, do as I say. Call Jimmy right away. Okay, all right. Jimmy, I got to find a way to keep from marrying this ugly bitch. This ho is so ugly she can scare a hungry bulldog off the back of a meat truck. Call Lucifer up and tell him you got the claps and you wanna take a few years to clear your system up. Man, that's not a few year affair, that's only a few day affair. Well hell, tell him you got the Alabama claps. I got it, Nell, give me the phone. But the bitch is still ugly enough to break daylight with her fist. Now what you fixin' to do? I'm gonna call Lucifer. No need to call him, he know he got an ugly bitch. (phone rings) Hello? Lou, listen. I've got a question to ask you. Yes, I'd like to go into meditation before my wedding. Meditation? What do you mean meditation? Well my father was a guru and he said to me "Son, my only son," says "it would be nice "if you would meditate before your wedding." Do you have to? Yes, old Father would like it, Lou. Very well. Just as long as you are there. I'll be there, but Lou, remember I'll be in deep meditation. Bye, Father. Meditation? Man, you don't know about no damn meditation! [Petey] Jimmy, you know you used to be good at making things. Yeah, so what's that mean? I want you to make a mask that looks like me. And we'll go and get a wino and we'll dope that sucker up not with wine, but with the heavy shit. We'll put that mask on him and when Lou comes to pick me up we'll let him take him. And by the time he find out it ain't me, we'll be all the way across country. Now where are you gonna find a wino? Down at the Dewdrop Inn. If you go down there dressed like that you'll drop in. (jazzy music) [Petey] There one is over there, Jimmy. [Jimmy] Where? [Petey] You see him right there. Man look at that asshole, don't you know he too fat? You right, he is all butt and gut, but he'll do. Let's dope up that son of a gun and carry him to ol' Lou. Well give me the shit then, let me get him ready. When I get him set up, I want y'all to come right out there soon as I get him to turn around and do it to him, you hear? Get him ready. What's happening, Uncle Jake? I haven't seen you in three years. Man I've been back in town a week, I've been looking for, where you been? I'm not your Uncle Jake! You'll be my uncle now, you fat rascal, you and anything else I want you to be. [Ted] Damn, looks just like Petey! How long will this mask last, Jimmy? At least a couple days. [Petey] Good. I'll tell my Father not to disturb my meditation for a couple of weeks. What about y'alls honeymoon? Yeah, suppose the ugly broad want some and she started playing around with that damn wino and nothing happens? Then she'll know how I feel. (laughing) Don't worry, don't worry. She will never know the difference. But Petey, suppose Lucifer finds out we done crossed him, man you know the shit's gonna fly. Listen, I'd rather for the shit to fly than for me to have to marry that ugly bitch. But you know that weird dude don't take no shit. Just remember one thing. What's that? I've got his cane and that makes me just as powerful as he. There it is, it's finished. All right, let's put it on the wino and see how it fits. (comical percussion) Well Petey, there you lay and here you stand. But if ol' Lucifer find out, I'm gonna tell you there'll be some shit in the sand. It's weird. Petey, he looks just like you. Well kiss my Aunt Rhoda's ass. (mumbles) resemble me. I tell you what we do, call my Father and tell him that I am ready to be picked up. Where am I supposed to sleep tonight? Baby, stay here, ain't nothing but a wino, he'll be out for two, three days. Petey, I'm not staying here with no derelict. I'll tell you what, we'll rent a motel room for the night. Good. Petey, I still think you oughta marry the ugly old rascal and figure how to get you a divorce when you get down in hell. Don't worry about it, it'll work. Let's cover the wino up and get the hell outta here. (funk music) Damn, time sure is going slow, it's only three o'clock. I wish we could get this shit over with, this is worrying the hell out of me. Why, why did you have to meet him here in my place man?! Oh Petey, I'm so scared. I mean what if something goes wrong? We may never see each other again. Now don't worry about it. Everything's gonna be all right, baby. (funk music) (gasps) Petey, it's him. [Steve] Uh oh! Don't worry about it. Everybody just smile. Good afternoon, Petey and friends. Good afternoon, Father. Ah, Petey, I feel great, just great! Father, why are you here so soon? I thought you were coming down about 11 o'clock tonight? Oh Petey, I came by to give you a pre-wedding gift. If your friends will excuse you for awhile. I'm going away with my Father for a little while. I want y'all to take care of the fort. Can you dig it? Father! I hope I'll see you later. Wait a minute, man, where in the hell are we going? My, you're quite edgy. Pre-wedding jitters, I suppose. I wanna know about this gift you've been telling me about. It's just up the street, Petey. Come along! Man, if you've got to run for it it must be a groovy situation. That's the spirit! (laughing) (funk music) Oh Father, why you bringing me here? Look like this place been closed for years. (clattering) Enter, my son. Go go go go. Hmmm? (laughing) Come on, that's the spirit. (growling) (yelling) Back, back! Back back back! Damn, father! You having trouble trying to find a husband for your daughter. You ain't gonna never find a wife for your son. That's not my son. Your very own bachelor party, Petey. [Petey] Father, there's no one here but us. But father! How in the world? [Lucifer] When I was young, I always wanted one. Never did though. (twinkling) Have fun, Petey. Petey. Petey. Petey. He's indeed strong. (laughing) (funk music) (yelling) (laughing) (laughing) I'll never forget this raggedy old shack. If I ever get a chance I'll damn sure come back. A gift from my Father that's against the law, but you girls will always remember ol' Petey Wheatstraw! (maniacal laughter) Where in the hell is Petey? He should've been here hours ago. What time is it, Jimmy? It's almost 11 o'clock, Nell. I'm supposed to be calling the man in a few minutes. Petey, where in the hell have you been? Supposed to being pick you up in a few minutes. Partying hardy, is everything ready? Take a look at yourself. Good, when they come to pick me up I want y'all to act very sad that I'm leaving. And when they leave, let's meet over at Nell's place. Okay. Hey hey, they're here, they coming in right now! The time has arrived. [Nell] Oh Petey. (ominous music) Petey Wheatstraw must come with us. [Jimmy] He's waiting, sir. But be very careful with him because you do not want to disturb his deep meditation. Goodbye, Petey, we're gonna miss you so much! (tires pealing) (groaning) (growling) (gasps) (peeling sound) (screaming) (brakes squeal) (screaming) ("Here Comes The Bride") We've been had, my dear. (high-pitched screaming) (ominous rumbling) (eerie tones) (grunting) (speaking gibberish) How could he do that? Of course, he still has that cane. Get that cane and bring that wretched Petey Wheatstraw to me! I knew it, I knew it, Petey, I told you it wasn't gonna work! Oh my apartment must be a wreck! Petey, maybe you should've married her. Nell, you got be sick! (growling) (screaming) (funk music) (screaming) (growling) (eerie tones) Petey, Petey, I told you it wouldn't work! They're out to get me, I don't know what we gonna do! Oh Petey, they were horrible! Shit, I was scared to death! The cane is the strength, as long as we can keep it, we have nothing to fear! Then what we supposed to do, live together forever? The cane, we can keep it until we can get out of town, it will protect us. Let's make it, we gonna catch the first thing smoking. I have been made a complete fool of. Now retribution is due Petey Wheatstraw. Bring the dirty dog to me! I'll fix his ass! (growling) You are my chosen disciples. The prides of my kingdom. Now go... and bring Petey Wheatstraw to me. (growling) Can we all please hurry up, we late, we gotta catch the damn plane! Jimmy, we're hurrying as fast as we can, Petey, what about my apartment and all my things? To hell with this apartment! We've got to make it, let's get out of here! (screaming) (yelling gibberish) (men grunting and groaning) Petey, look out! (groaning) (men grunting and groaning) Ted! Petey, let's get the hell outta here! (eerie tones) What's going on? (Nell yelling) Come on here, you ol-- Petey, wait! Forget that stuff, Nell! I gotta get my stuff. - Come on! - [Nell] It costs money! Dammit! (funk music) [Nell] Petey! Jimmy, wait! Can't wait, come on! I'm trying, I'm outta breath! Come on and sit down for a minute and rest. Petey, what's happening? Now we gotta do something. (growling) (grunting and groaning) Oh my God! Oh damn, Petey! [Lucifer] Petey Wheatstraw! (tense music) Stop fighting at once, or the woman dies! Petey! Petey, please help me! [Lucifer] Bargain time again, Petey! Come on, y'all. Just you, Petey! And bring my cane with you! Jimmy, go and get your car. Park it out front. I'll be down in a minute. (dramatic trumpet riff) (funky riff) (suspenseful music) I trusted you, Petey Wheatstraw. And you made a fool of me. I could kill you, Petey! And feel nothing. But I have a better idea. You will marry my daughter and I will see to it that she makes every breath you draw a prayer for death! Forever! What about Nell? I have no use for her, she may go. Seize him! (upbeat funk music) (men grunting and groaning) Bind him! Hold him, you idiots! Nell, where the hell is Petey? They still got him up there. Jimmy, you gotta do something, now we gotta help him, we gotta go up there or something. I'm not going up there. He told me stay in the car, I'm not going up there Nell, no. [Lucifer] Hold him! (men grunting and groaning) (eerie tones) Jimmy. What? Can you take me home for a minute? Hell no! Jimmy, look, I gotta get my money, I gotta get my makeup, my underwear, I need my things! No, no! I'm not going nowhere, I'm sitting right here 'till Petey come. [Ted] Oh Jimmy, it's just right up the street, we'll make it back in time. - Aw shit, Ted! - [Nell] Please Jimmy, please! Okay. (eerie tones) (deep rumbling noise) Petey! Petey! Petey, it's me, wait! Wait, Petey, we're friends. I trusted you, Petey. You must trust me! You can't trust the Devil! Any fool knows that! Daniel Webster tricked you and you still brought your little ass back. This time it's over! No more heartache and pain. I'm gonna destroy your ass! With your own walking cane. No, Petey! No, Petey, no, no! No! No! (screaming) No! No! (screaming) (screaming) (fire crackling) (screaming) ("Funeral March") (laughing) [Nell] There he is, there he is, there's Petey! [Jimmy] Yeah I knew it, I told you we shouldn't have left in the first place. Where's he going?! It's over, it's over! - He mistook that as my car! - [Nell] Oh Jimmy, that's him! Who?! I killed the Devil, he's dead! That's the spirit, my son! (ominous music) No, Petey, no! This door's locked, I can't get-- - It won't open! - [Jimmy] Petey! How you been, Petey?
