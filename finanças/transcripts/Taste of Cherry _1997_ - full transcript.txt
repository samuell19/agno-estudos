Where are you going? Down there, not very far The barracks down there? -Near the reservoir? -Yes You look tired I guess I am -Are you worn out? -Yes A soldier is never tired! What do you expect? I've waked from Darabad -From Darabad? -Yes But today's a holiday I'm on duty tonight until six in the morning Then what are you doing? -Where will you go? -To my aunt's She's dead, I stay with her husband, a janitor How long ago were you drafted? Two months -Still in training? -Yes Where are you from?

Nine -Nine? -Yes -They all work? -Yes, all of them -Do you know anyone in Tehran? -Yes -Relatives? -Yes I have two brothers in Tehran Why don't you stay with them? They're married, they have small houses, children I can't stay there Do you have money? Soldiers get pay -Money? -A little... the pay's not good Is it enough for you? Oh no, it's not enough When do you have to be back by? Six p.m. It's five now You're so fond of the place, you get there an hour early? No, not really... no We've got an hour to kill. How about a drive? I may have a well-paid job to offer you to supplement your income I want to be at the barracks by six -What? -I want to be back by six I'll drive you back Don't worry, you won't be late -Shall we go? -Okay I'll get you back by six, don't worry You say the barracks aren't much fun? I had fun when I did my military service It was the best time of my life I met my closest friends there Especially in the first six months I remember we used to get up at four in the morning After breakfast, we'd shine our boots and we'd go out on manoeuvers. The major would join us There were 40 to 45 men in the regiment The major would start counting He'd tell us to repeat: One Two Three Four Do you count too? Is it the same? Well? How do you count? Are you shy? -Yes. -What? Why? Don't you count with your friends at the barracks? Yes So you don't think of me as a friend Of course I do, we're friends No, you act as if we don't know each other -No, it's not that. -Well, then? It's not that Listen, this is how we did it: One Two Three Four One, two, three, four One, two, three, four -Go on, repeat after me: One -One two, three Is that how you do it at the barracks?! -Soldiers don't count like that! -I can't help it You're taking me a long way! I need to know what you want -What you have to do? -Yes You know, son If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't ask what the job is, but rather how good the pay is For someone like you the pay's what matters. A job is a job It's easy if you look at it that way This isn't an ordinary job but neither is the pay In ten minutes, you can earn six months' pay What's the job? Forget the job, it's the pay that matters You have to tell me what it is! Listen, when you ask a laborer to dig foundations does he ask if they're for a hospital, a lunatic asylum or a mosque or a school? He does his job and gets his pay Ever been a laborer? Yes Were you told what you were digging for? -No, no one told me. -Why ask me then? Help me out, I'll pay you It's not hard, you'll see Okay? Where are you going? I have to be at the barracks by six I'll drive you back, wait a while I want to get out! I want to get out! -Get out? -Yes A call of nature? No, I was thinking I could go Why did I ask you to come? You think I'm nuts? Do I look nuts? I was thinking I ought to get back I promised I'd get you back by six and I will Wait a while Come on, get out a minute -I need to get back. -Get out, I'll explain You see that hole That hole there Now listen carefully At six in the morning, come here and call me twice: ''Mr. Badii! Mr. Badii!'' If I reply, take my hand to help me out of there There's 200,000 tomans in the car Take it and go If I don't reply, throw in 20 spadefuls of earth on top of me -Then take the money and go. -Take me back Keep it. Take me back! I don't want to cause trouble -Trouble? What trouble? -I don't want it. It's late I want to go back. I don't want to be involved in all this You can't throw 20 spadefuls of earth in that hole? Right now, I really need you otherwise I wouldn't have begged you You want me to beg you? Is that what you want? No, why would you beg me? What does ''need'' mean? What does ''help'' mean? ''Help'' isn't necessarily paid for, but I'll give you money, I'll help you Don't you need money? Are you sure? Of course I do Well? Isn't 200,000 enough? It's not that. I can't do this for you It's not a matter of money You can't throw earth in a hole? Yes, but not on top of someone, not on someone's head You can't throw earth on someone! If he was alive, he'd stand up to respond. Look, I really need your help. I'm not mad! When you throw the earth in, the man won't be alive, or he wouldn't be in that hole Do you understand now? Do you understand me? Yes So if you understand, get out, come and see When you come back here at six tomorrow morning Is your barracks over there? From there to here will only take you 20 minutes Call my name twice: ''Mr. Badii, Mr. Badii!'' If I reply, you'll take my hand to help me climb out You'll get paid But if I don't reply... Get out Get out! Get out, come and see! It's God's will I should need you and you don't want to help! You don't want to?! You won't bury me alive! Right now, they're burying dozens of people As we speak, dozens of dead people are being buried -You've never seen a gravedigger? -No, never I'm not a gravedigger I don't bury people I know you're not a gravedigger If I'd wanted one, I'd have fetched one It's you I need You're like my son Help me I have to beg? Is that what you want? No, what's the use of begging? Get out then, come and have a look Maybe you'll feel up to it 20 spadefuls of earth Just 20, Each paid 10,000 tomans Where are you from? -Kurdistan. -You're a Kurd! A Kurd has to be brave You people have fought so many wars, known such suffering... Your villages have been decimated You've probably used a gun, right? Know what a gun is? Why you're given one? So you can kill when you need to I don't want to give you a gun to kill me I'm giving you a spade, a spade You're a farmer, right? Just pretend you're farming and that I'm manure to be spread at the foot of a tree Is that hard? You're destined to use a gun, not a spade! You can't even use a spade! Thank you! Thank you very much! -Hello. -Hello -How are you? -Well, thanks -What's that machine for? -Making cement Really? Why isn't it working? This place is closed now. The workers aren't here So what are you doing here? I'm the security guard -Are you alone? -Yes All alone... Do you enjoy that? Come and join me -I don't want to disturb you. -Come on up! -I have to climb this ladder? -Yes -How can you climb this? -I'm used to it -You're used to it. -Yes -Hello. -Hello What a nice place Nice? It's nothing but earth and dust You don't think earth's nice? Earth gives us all the good things! So according to you, all good things return to the earth I think you're...? I'm Afghani -Where from? -Mazar-e Sharif That's a strange name. Whose ''Mazar'' is it? It's the tomb of the Imam Ali It's a place of pilgrimage Isn't the Imam Ali's tomb in Najaf? Yes, but some people think it's in Mazar-e Sharif Strange What are you doing? I'm making myself an omelette. It isn't worthy of you I'll make you some tea Thank you very much! Don't you get bored here alone? I'm used to it. I'm used to loneliness too Do you know that man? Yes, he's a fellow countryman He's Afghani? Yes, he's a ''seminarist''. He's here for his holidays A ''seminarist''? He should be in a seminary He felt lonely, he came to see me He's been here for two or three nights Is he staying for good? Of course not...just three nights I didn't catch what you said -Is he staying tonight? -Yes, he's staying You're not entirely alone then No, not entirely alone -Is he Afghani too? -Yes So many Afghanis around here! There've been a lot since the war in Afghanistan Between 2 and 3 million Afghanis live in Iran With the war here, why didn't they go back? The war against Iraq only concerned the Iranians But the war at home concerned us And our war didn't concern you? You could say your war troubled us but the Afghanistan War was harder... more painful for us Tell me today's a holiday, so why are you here alone? You feel sad, so do I Come for a drive. We can get a change of scene, talk I'm the security guard here, I'm in charge -A guard in this place? -Yes But who could carry off a machine that heavy? It's a holiday. No one needs guards. Come on Let's get some fresh air. Everything's safe It's my duty. We all have our responsibilities -I can't leave my post. -You really can't? No, sorry I thought we could get some air I'll go and see your friend, the seminarist Maybe we'll go for a drive together I've made some tea Leave it for later. Good-bye -Try going the other way. -The ladder moves! It's dangerous! Mend it You can mend it by wrapping fuse-wire around it Are you well? You're Afghani, aren't you? Yes What are you doing? I've got three days' holiday I was alone, I felt down My friend Ahmad was alone too so I came here to visit him I meant what are you doing in Iran? I study at the Tchizar seminary Aren't there any seminaries in Afghanistan? Yes, there are some. But there was a war on And my seminary wasn't that good so my father told me to study in Iran or at Najaf So I came to study in Iran What about the fees? Does your father send you money? My father isn't that well-off, no The seminary pays me 2,000 tomans During the summer, I work to build up my savings What kind of work? I work as a laborer, simple work I didn't know a seminarist could work as a laborer When you need to, you work So if a job comes along, you take it? Yes Aren't you wondering why I've offered you a ride? Yes I know that your duty is to preach and guide people But you're young, you have time, you can do that later It's your hands that I need I don't need your tongue or your mind I'm lucky that those hands belong to a true believer With the patience, endurance and perseverance that you learn you're the best person to carry out this job You're not telling me what I have to do I know my decision goes against your beliefs You believe God gives life and takes it when He sees fit But there comes a time when a man can't go on He's exhausted and can't wait for God to act So he decides to act himself There, that's what's called ''suicide'' You see, the word ''suicide'' isn't only made for dictionaries It has to have a practical application And here's the application Man has to decide on its application I don't really understand. Tell me what I have to do If I can, I'll do it for you I've decided to free myself from this life What for? It wouldn’t help you to know and I can't talk about it And you wouldn’t understand It's not because you don't understand but you can't feel what I feel You can sympathize, understand show compassion. But feel my pain? No You suffer and so do I. I understand you You comprehend my pain but you can't feel it That's why I ask you to be a true Moslem and help me. Can you? Yes, I understand you. But suicide is wrong Since the Hadiths, our twelve Imams and the Koran refer to suicide and say that man mustn't kill himself God entrusts man's body to him Man must not torment that body I understand you, but suicide, viewed from every angle... That's right but I told you that I didn't need a lecture If I had wanted a lecture I'd have turned to someone with more experience, who's finished his studies I'm simply asking for a helping hand My hand does God's justice What you want wouldn’t be just I know that suicide is one of the deadly sins But being unhappy is a great sin too When you're unhappy you hurt other people Isn't that a sin too? When you hurt others, isn't that a sin? Hurting your family... your friends hurting yourself isn't that a sin? If I hurt you, that isn't a sin but if I kill myself, it is? You're right hurting the people close to you is a great sin too I think that God is merciful and so great that He doesn't want to see His creatures suffer He's so great that He can't possibly want to force us to live That's why He grants man this solution Have you ever thought about the meaning of this? I've thought about it but not like you have In any case our talk won't get us anywhere This isn't the time or place Get out now. Next to that tree, there's a hole Go and look. I'll explain afterwards Go on. Take a look Get in I'll explain now I've decided to swallow all my sleeping pills tonight and then come and lie down in that hole To sleep What I want you to do is wait until dawn then come here like a kind brother and cover me with soil. That's all Of course I follow the Koran when it says- This work will bring you not only Heaven's reward but also a material reward so you won't need to work this summer The Koran says You shall not kill yourself What's the difference between killing someone and killing yourself? Killing yourself is killing What's your decision? Why don't you get out? My friend has cooked an omelette and it smells good. Let's eat You'll find a solution Thank you! I know he's cooked but eggs are bad for me! Some other time! Good-bye! Mister, mister Mister, move your car. The digger has to work Clear the way Move your car, the digger has to work What are you doing here? This is no place to sit down! Are you sick? Come on, move your car! You can't sleep here! If you want cement, you have to go to the office Come on, take your car Why have you come here? Are you sick? Do you want some tea? Stand up, take your car Come on... Come on Thank you. So, no more questions? No You've got your bearings? That tree is a good landmark Yes So, no more questions? No problems? No problems but... But what? When you want to help someone You have to do it properly, with all your heart It's better... more just and more reasonable You can even use your hands instead of a spade Keep your feelings for more essential things But how? What's your job? I already told you What specialization? Shovelling earth doesn't require specialization Just shovelling earth If I could help in another way I'd prefer that Just do what I ask But what help? If a man wants to help his fellow man he ought to do it differently! He can save a life I won't be responsible for someone's death but, since you ask, I'll say yes But it's hard. Admit that it's not easy! If you don't explain your problem, who can help you? You don't know me But you have relatives, friends, a brother Forgive me for prying It's either a family problem or debts Every problem has its solution But if you don't talk no one can help you We all have problems in life If we all chose this way out of every tiny problem there would be no one left on earth Isn't that right? No one! Not a living soul! Turn left, please -I don't know this road. -I know it It's longer but better and more beautiful I've been a prisoner of this desert for 35 years I'll tell you something that happened to me It was just after I got married We had all kinds of troubles I was so fed up with it that I decided to end it all One morning, before dawn I put a rope in my car My mind was made up, I wanted to kill myself I set off for Mianeh. This was in 1960 I reached the mulberry tree plantations I stopped there. It was still dark I threw the rope over a tree but it didn't catch hold I tried once, twice but to no avail So then I climbed the tree and tied the rope on tight Then I felt something soft under my hand. Mulberries Deliciously sweet mulberries I ate one. It was succulent, then a second and third Suddenly, I noticed that the sun was rising over the mountaintop What sun, what scenery, what greenery! All of a sudden, I heard children heading off to school They stopped to look at me They asked me to shake the tree The mulberries fell and they ate I felt happy Then I gathered some mulberries to take them home My wife was still sleeping When she woke up, she ate mulberries as well And she enjoyed them too I had left to kill myself and I came back with mulberries A mulberry saved my life A mulberry saved my life You ate mulberries, so did your wife, and everything was fine No, it wasn't like that, but I changed Afterwards, it was better but I had in fact changed my mind I felt better Every man on earth has problems in his life That's the way it is. There are so many people on earth There isn't one family without problems I don't know your problem otherwise I could explain better When you go to see a doctor you tell him where it hurts Excuse me, you're not Turkish, are you? Here's a joke. Don't feel offended A Turk goes to see a doctor. He tells him: ''When I touch my body with my finger, it hurts ''When I touch my head, it hurts, my legs, it hurts ''my belly, my hand, it hurts'' The doctor examines him and then tells him: ''Your body's fine but your finger's broken!'' My dear man, your mind is ill but there's nothing wrong with you. Change your outlook I had left home to kill myself but a mulberry changed me an ordinary, unimportant mulberry The world isn't the way you see it You have to change your outlook and change the world Be optimistic Look at things positively You're in your prime! Because of some minor problem you want to commit suicide For one single problem Life is like a train that keeps on moving forward and then reaches the end of the line, the terminus And death waits at the terminus Of course, death is a solution but not at first, not during your youth Forgive me for dragging you off along this rocky road You think something is good, then realize you're wrong The main thing is to think hard You believe what you do is right but then you realize that you're wrong Talk, say something to give me a breather I've talked too much, I've said everything I've given a whole speech. Just say something! Turn left here, please In any case, if you don't talk, I'll talk some more If you don't talk, I will Have you lost all hope? Have you ever looked at the sky when you wake in the morning? At dawn, don't you want to see the sun rise? The red and yellow of the sun at sunset, don't you want to see that anymore? Have you seen the moon? Don't you want to see the stars? The night of the full moon, don't you want to see it again? You want to close your eyes? Please, take the right fork! The people on the other side would like to take a look here and you want to rush over there! Don't you ever want to drink water from a spring again? Or wash your face in that water? Turn right! If you look at the four seasons each season brings fruit In summer, there's fruit, in autumn too winter brings different fruit and spring too No mother can fill her fridge with such a variety of fruit for her children No mother can do as much for her children as God does for His creatures You want to refuse all that? You want to give it all up? You want to give up the taste of the cherries? Don't. I'm your friend, I'm begging you! Turn right Turn right, this is the main road Turn left, please Before I get out I'm going to sing you a song in Turkish It means: ''My love, I'm flying off, come to me ''I'm hounded from my friend's garden, come to me ''From happy days before ''I've fallen on hard times, come to me'' Tell me, we barely know each other You go, I'm your friend. You stay, I'm your friend In any case, I'm your friend You stay, I'm your friend. You go, I'll be your friend too Good-bye Do you work here? Wait. Tell me what you do I told you, I work here at the Natural History Museum No, I mean tomorrow morning Tomorrow, I come at dawn. I call twice: ''Mister... Mister...'' Badii! Badii, and you reply Then I take your hand to help you out And if I don't reply? You will reply! Inch'Allah, I know what you'll say But what if I don't reply? I'll do what you asked me to do, don't worry! Say it to put my mind at ease Some things are easier to do than to say In any case, you'll do it If it wasn't for my child, I wouldn’t Believe me, it's hard It's a deal. I come and I cover you with earth You take your money and you leave What a relief for you! I must go, the kids are waiting May this money help to cure your child Keep your promise, or you won't be blessed I hope you'll be all right Take this now. You'll get the rest tomorrow Thanks for bringing me back here. Thanks again! I'll see you at six tomorrow. Or rather, you'll see me at six God willing, you'll see me too Take it, take the money Thank you but no. After I do the job Sir, please, could you take our photo?
