Nothing here. Keep looking. Give it to me. Spanish? Portuguese. 50/50? That must be him. Certainly has a limp. They say it was a lion. 9 am and he's heading for the pub, probably broke his leg tripping while he was intoxicated. Now, now, Lady Anna, he has a sterling reputation. A reputation for what? I've got a plan, take this to the car. I'll have one as well. Oh no, Mr. Quatermain, allow me. A tip. A drink, ma'am. I'll have a whiskey on the rocks. Thank you. To the queen... um... to a cold beer and fast women. Mr. Quatermain, a year ago at this time, I believe you were at a place called Boomguater, just North of the TranceVal, you were trading there. Did you happen to meet a man called Neville? He's lost. Sorry about your friend, thanks for the beer. Sir, do you have no manners? No. Mr. Quatermain! Mr. Quatermain! Mr. Quatermain, please, listen, he wrote me, he mentioned that after you sold him some oxen, you took him to the outskirts of Boomquater. That was my final correspondence with him, it's been 16 weeks since I heard from him. Well, Allan, aren't you going to help him find his pen-pal? Well... I don't know him. Really? I fancied you did. Sir Henry Curtis. I really, don't care. Allan... Mr. Quatermain, But... You certainly charmed the pants off of him. Didn't you say, Henry? There are many ways to win a battle. You seemed to have had second thoughts, Mr. Quatermain. Let's do this. Politics is a dangerous game. Let's leave politics out of this. You seem to have the South African National Party confused with the Nazi Party. I'm not confused. The map. The money. 10,000 pounds. What's this? This is half a map, where's the rest? This is the only map, it will get you far enough. But not to the treasure, this is not the deal. The lion I killed this morning weighed considerably more than you. I'm so hot, is there any water? There's water over there. I think I'm dehydrated, I can't bear this African sun. My money. My map. That's the map Neville was talking about to King Solomon's treasure. Then that's Neville's map. Not exactly. Then that Quatermain knows where Neville is. Lady Anna, keep still. Lady Anna! Quatermain, you're a liar and a thief. Sorry for the interruption. No problem Get back! Just stay back, alright? I'll shoot. You can't do it. Alright, see? There, we're just going to walk out, alright. I want back map, Quatermain. In there. Come on. If you're going to shoot at Hartford, don't miss. Get behind the wagon. Alright, give it to me. Run! I'll cover you! Run! Get behind the wagon! You'll be safe here. Hold on. Hold on Mr. Quatermain, I've been reading about you for some time. And believe me, you've gathered some acclaim, but no matter what transpired here today, we're your friends Oh friend. I've got a train to catch. You have to go after him, here. Well, what about you, Henry? Don't worry about me, I'll improvise, go on! Come on. Hi. I wana a ticket to where the gentleman went please. Thanks. Is this seat taken? Yes, it is. I don't see anyone. Who was sitting here? Anyone but you. I think we got off on the wrong foot. You're a businessman you came to this town to do business, Sir Henry and I have a proposition This is a two hour train ride. Are you going to shut up, or do I need to send you to the other car? I don't know why I wasted my time. Well. Why don't you sit and think about it, and maybe it will come to you. Well that was pretty childish, wasn't it? What do you want from me? Clearly you need the money, why won't you go on this trip with us? This has got nothing to do with money. You're totally out of your depth here. I will decide when I'm out of my depth. On expeditions like this, people don't survive. Are you prepared for that? Yes. Good day gentleman. Stay back. We have to go, now! What, now? Watch your head. Yuck. I don't know whether to thank you or slap you. Why don't you do something later? Great. Need a lift? Sir Henry, you never cease to amaze me. Hop in. Settled? We can wait here. I've organized a carriage. Can I see it? I was right. Wasn't I? This is the map. This is the map to King Solomon's treasure. No. No? There is no map to King Solomon's treasure. Then it's a forgery, and you were selling... No. This map was indeed penned by Jose Silvestri, but... the treasure doesn't exist, it's a fantasy, a myth. Many good men have died in pursuit of storybook riches. And my brother who went searching... He is a fool. Is he? Is he a fool Mr. Quatermain? It was sent in the last parcel from my brother. You're a hunter and an expert tracker, we need your services and we will pay you handsomely. This isn't about your brother, is it? Take the treasure, if we find it, it's yours, the whole lot, if that's what we need to secure your involvement. Well, for the map, and myself, it will be 30,000. But you agreed to sell it to that Hartford character for 10,000. Well, then let's make it 40,000. 20,000 up front, today. Done. Mr. Quatermain, um, just to make clear, if there's anything to make this journey more suitable, planes, or artillery, consider it done. Henry has unlimited funds at home. Where we're going, money has no value. Freshen up, pack light, we leave in an hour. Don't we have quarters? Umbopa, some tea. Umbopa, please forward this to my son. I'll be back in 5 weeks time, in the event that I don't return, I want you to forward this to him as well. Mr. Quatermain, you are talking nonsense, you will be able to send it yourself when you come back. In the event that I don't return. A bit feminine, don't you think? He had a wife once. What happened? She died a few years back, some sort of fever. Anna, have some restraint. This must be his wife. And his son. Would you like something to drink? Sir Henry? I'm fine. Thank you. Mrs. Harrisford? Lady, Harrisford, no thanks. Thank you. Put it back. Right, I'll check on the luggage, shall I? Remember, if you don't hear from me in 5 weeks time, I want you to leave this place, take whatever you desire and go back to your homeland. No, I prefer to go with you. No. You are following the map, I need to go there. No good will come from this map. I will be of great help to you Mr. Quatermain. Please, let me come. I know that you're good. Don't forget to post the letter. Umbopa, is it? How long have you worked for Mr. Quatermain? 7 years. And before that? I've worked many places. I can't quite place your accent. Is it Zulu? No. Causo? No. Swasi? No. Chigani, perhaps? No. Where exactly are you from? I'm from many places. Whoa, what was that? Let's go. This way, come on, go, inside! Get out. We have to go, now. I can't. Get out! Well, throw me a towel or something. Great. You picked a fine time to take a bath. Well, I didn't know there were going to be people shooting, did I? You've got 10 seconds and then we're leaving. Well, throw me a robe or something. Run. They're Hartford's men, there will be more coming, come on. The weird thing about King Solomon is that he was from North Africa, how do you suppose the treasure came all the way down here? So far away from Jerusaleum. Solomon was the second son of King David, the first son Aenea was passed over. When Solomon was crowned king Aenea later revolted, in fear that he would take over. Solomon hid the treasure and promised to return it. To improve himself worth than that. Mr. Quatermain, how is that you obtained the map, then? My wife and I were on our honeymoon 10 years ago. Marie was French, she knew the story well. She was hoping to find the treasure with Mr. Quatermain, I heard her tell the story to their son. Who is this Ainsley, Hartford? He's a despicable man, a man who would sell South Africa to the highest bidder. Yes. He's an ivory dealer, dealing in black market animals. Rhino horns, elephant tusks, gorilla feet... I guess you run into all sorts of nefarious characters in the jungle. I suppose. Do you always approach your expeditions with such a disgusting amount of cynicism? Yes. What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. Do you know who said that? Oscar Wilde. Do you like the classics Mr. Quatermain, Emerson, Thoreau... I'm quite the reader myself. Allan! You're hot on the trail with my map! Funny! I don't recall our transaction had been completed. Memory is an odd thing. Let us pass Get that boy out of my face, Allan. This is between us, men. I am Sir Henry Curtis, and that is the second and last time I will introduce myself. I am the founder of this expedition and I suggest you let us pass. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I... we should stop all of this violence. I mean none of you are going to come out of this alive. Isn't that so Quatermain? Soon you'll be crossing into territory where you and your little party will be overwhelmed. Swallowed by forces you can't even imagine, and Quatermain knows this, that's why he sent your fee to his son in London. Is that true Quatermain? Now this is a small country and I have eyes everywhere. Now what I propose is this. I'll give you proper protection, you can't make it alone or without support, I'll get rid of the henchmen, and I'll join you and your party and at the end we can share the spoils. Now that's my best offer. I'm not giving you the map. Then you'll all die. Death comes to us all, it's up to us to decide how we meet it. Well it seems its nearer than you think Let's get this off. Where does it hurt? Right there... it's really swollen. I can hardly move it. It's not broken. You just twisted it. How much further? 3 days. Here, take this, it will make you feel better. It's medicine, it will help ease the pain. Come on. I feel much better, come on, let's go. Shiva's breasts. This is as far as Neville's map goes. The rest of the map goes between them, let's hurry up, we want to get there before night falls. I can't imagine Neville making it this far. You must keep your spirits high, Anna, Neville would never have given up. Come on. Come on. Let's set up the camp for the night. We need to collect firewood. Quatermain, tell me why did you accept this assignment, there must be some hope that there's treasure? You've got that wrong. Then why are you here? Pay is good. I can't survive on air alone. Besides, I have to support myself. Ah yes, your son, such the devoted father, spending so much time with the lad. Come with me. You've had it in for me, from day one. What have I ever done to you? Nothing. Then what's wrong with you? I don't get you. Why do you have to get me? You're mean, irascible, arrogant... Well, you're quite the bundle ofjoy yourself. I just want to find my brother. That's the first honest thing you've said since we left. Keep on it. You really don't think the map is going to lead us anywhere, do you? I hope it leads us to your brother. That's odd, somebody has already collected firewood here. Henry, no! Don't look! Don't look! Allan, Allan? Allan! Sir Henry. What deal have you made with them Hartford? The only deal they could afford. The South African National Party has disbanded all tribes in South Africa, I simply made a deal with them to leave them alone, in exchange for the treasure. Lady Anna. Henry?! Is it really you? Henry. Henry? Henry, I can't believe... It's so good to see you. How long have you been here? I don't know. I stopped counting after weeks, I don't know anymore. The days got longer and I stopped so... Here, eat something. You must be starving. The food here is terrible. What happened to the rest of your party? They were captured, we split up into different parts of the camp. Some of them died trying to escape, and the othere... they take them at night... I guess I was the lucky one. I never found the treasure... I went as far as I could, but... It doesn't matter. All that matters... Anna? How is she? Where is she? What's he saying? He wants to buy you. I'm not for sale! 16 what? 16 cows, Lady Anna. That's ridiculous. Listen to me, I'm from England, you can't buy me, he's a crook, he doesn't own me... All is from the sky and see me, with this all to be me. Come to follow me, hear the trumpets sounding off the season, on the hill from here, the war cry is resounding... Boy's sing song and story, coming in from the mountain, OK! I am the king! We're on the right track. That's Ashtueth, the Goddess of the Visidonians, Kamash... The god of the Moebites. And Mulcom, the God of the Children of the Omen... Then that's the entrance to the cave... Hartford's taken Lady Anna there. We're nearly there, Lady Anna, nearly there. It's not far now, watch your backs. Now? It's this way. Now remember, Lady Anna, the more you struggle, the more it will hurt! This way, Lady Anna. Give it up Quatermain! I claim this treasure on behalf of the National Party! I don't care about the treasure, just give me the girl. Oh, I don't think you're in the position to negotiate, do you, Allan? Back off! Give me the girl! That's all I want! Well, you can't always have what you want. No! No! You came for me. We have to go. Now! We have to go, now! Leave, be careful! Go there, come on! Be careful, stick to the sides, come on!
