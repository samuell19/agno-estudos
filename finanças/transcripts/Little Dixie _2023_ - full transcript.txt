NEWS REPORTER: ...what has been a rocky week for Governor Jeffs, amid allegations of corruption relating to the oil industry and political favors. This morning, the governor followed through on his promise of law and order. Cartel Under boss Juan Miguel Prado was executed, in what was the state's first capital punishment case in more than seven years. Governor Jeffs, then prosecutor, was in attendance and is holding a press conference now. DOC: Fuck is he doing? Shouldn't you be there? He's running the show now. He's the boy wonder, remember? We dad a deal, Billie. RICHARD: What I witnessed this morning was the state exercising its right to capital punishment. REPORTER 1: Mr. Governor, will you address the... I need to tell you this is gonna be a problem. This is not good. He's gotta look tough on crime and the Cartel. People are scared, Doc. We just executed Prado's brother and now he's gonna take a victory lap. You gotta talk to this guy. You know him. Guys like this will sell their children to win. (SCOFFS) BILLIE: What do you want me to say, huh? Are you seeing them today? DOC: Yeah. Okay, so we don't know what we don't know. You'll see them and then we'll go from there. "We don't know what we don't know"? REPORTER 1: Mr. Governor, will you address the corruption allegations reported against you this week? Reports that you were directly compensated for the Keystone deals? Those claims are baseless. Next question. REPORTER 2: Mr. Governor, why did you feel you had to attend the execution? Well I was the prosecutor in the Prado case. I felt like I owed it to the families of his victims and to Mr. Prado, to see this through to the end. REPORTER 2: What did you owe Mr. Prado? As a reminder to him and to his brother, Lalo Prado, and his heinous criminal organization, that this state and this great country won't stand for their kind. (WOMAN CRYING) With this new Task Force, I'm going to make it my mission to eradicate the Cartel's presence here, specifically Lalo Prado. Today's execution was the first step. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Next time I'm in that room, it'll be Lalo on the table, getting the needle. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) CUCO: (IN SPANISH) LALO: (IN SPANISH) CUCO: (IN SPANISH) (CHUCKLES) (IN ENGLISH) The United States doesn't own its people, Lalo. (IN SPANISH) (IN ENGLISH) Let me do this, Brother. (IN SPANISH) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) (CAR HORN HONKING) (CAR APPROACHING) NELL: Hey. DOC: Hi. You wanna get some donuts? NELL: Please. (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) NELL: You look tired. (INHALES DEEPLY) I am. How's the drinking? DOC: It's good. (CHUCKLES) How's your mom? Fine. (LAUGHS) (DOC LAUGHS) Did you get an attorney yet? DOC: Why you don't like these secret meetings? Dad. Yes, I have an attorney. Have you thought about where you wanna go? Yeah. DOC: Yeah? The mountains, the beach, the moon, what? It's expensive. I've been saving up. I have a presentation tonight. DOC: About what? NELL: I did it on you and what it's like to have a dad who served in the CIA. Special Forces, baby. Right. Well it's... it's just a little different, that's all. Think she'd let you come? No. Maybe you can video it. (CHUCKLES) I love you kiddo. I love you too. Don't let them corrupt you in there. Good luck, later. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (CAR ENGINE REVVING) (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (EXHALES DEEPLY) (CAR ENGINE REVVING) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (DOGS BARKING) Just as you said, no problem. Escorts picked them up when they crossed the Red River. DOC: What about tomorrow? JUAN: We'll be ready. I have a new crew coming in this evening to pack everything back up. I assume you saw the news. Oh, I did. I thought we had an understanding. DOC: I thought the same. JUAN: We know you did. Let's just get through tomorrow. VÃ¡monos. (DOC SIGHS) (LIGHTER CLICKS, FLICKS) (TRAFFIC NOISES) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, buddy! Put that thing out. What are you fucking crazy? You gonna try to kill us all here? (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Fucking Mexicans. (OMINOUS MUSIC CONTINUES) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Whiskey. (SOFT LOUNGE MUSIC PLAYING) Thank you. EMMA: I was surprised you showed up. Well, I tried not to. I do not know how you do these things. After 30 years of campaigns, you figure it out. How's little Nellie? Oh, she ain't so little. She's good though. She's a smart kid. Well, that doesn't surprise me. Billie told me she's gonna help out on the custody case. Yeah, that's the plan. Well, you don't go over there and do what you did, and then come back in one piece. She should realize that... you can't keep a girl from her dad. BILLIE: You showed. I'm here for her, not you. (ALL CHUCKLE) Honey, do you want another one? No, thank you. Can I get a minute? (POLICE SIRENS WAILING) They're gonna respond, Billie. Yeah. What did he say? Nothing. Which is worse. Okay. So what do you wanna do? Talk to Rich, tell him to cool it with the white knight bullshit, all right? I don't even wanna think about what they're gonna do. You can't do that. DOC: Why? Well, you can. But he doesn't know everything. So-- What doesn't he know? BILLIE: He doesn't wanna know, that's the agreement. What doesn't he know, Billie? Oh, come on Doc. I've had my arm up the ass of people like Jeffs for the past 30 fucking years. They get to put on their hats and wave to everyone from the parade floats, but they're bouncing on my fucking knee. He may be a war hero in your world, but here in mine, Jeffs knows what I tell him. DOC: Right. What haven't you told me, Billie? (ELEVATOR CHIMES) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) DOC: Clarke? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Doc. Clarke. Six-hundred a plate, I'm surprised to see you here. (CHUCKLES) Need to talk to Rich. Tonight is a busy night, Doc. Why don't you call my office tomorrow, maybe we can schedule a meeting for next week, huh? It needs to be tonight Clarke. What didn't you understand? The answer is no. (GROANS) Look at me, look at me. (GROANS) Listen to me you little fucking turd. The answer is, "I'll go get him, Doc." (GROANS) I'll go get him Doc, I'll go get him. (GROANS) (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) What is it? Clarke said it couldn't wait. (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) Go ahead, Billie. BILLIE: Damn it. It's the Prado thing. We need you to back down from the Task Force and let this whole thing die down a bit. Why would I do that? I just announced it. Remember when you were running, "Whatever needs to be done," right? I told you whatever it is, I didn't want to know. Where do you think those large, anonymous contributions came from, or the overwhelming Hispanic vote, huh? Those things aren't won at the fucking wishing well. What are you saying? (SCOFFS) That we have a few partners in this thing. Prado? How does this happen? I'm the sitting fucking governor. Everyone makes their deal with the devil. This one is yours. What does he expect from this deal you made? We look the other way on things concerning his interests. What the fuck are you saying to me? Not all, just some, he's practical. And most you don't need to be aware of because you have Doc and I. I mean, you hired me to fucking win. (SIGHS) (SCOFFS) Don't look so shocked, Richard. Naive doesn't look good on you. We just executed his brother. You kill three civilians, you get the needle, that's the deal. Lalo knew we couldn't save his brother, but I told you, don't dance on his fucking grave. Look, this is just a pit stop. We thread the needle here then we get to D.C. after one term. Don't shit your pants on me now. RICHARD: And with this Keystone thing... (INHALES DEEPLY) (GROANS) So... what do you advise that I do now, Billie? (CLEARS THROAT) Doc, can we have a minute? Clarke, fuck off. Yes. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) TAYLOR: Hey, Doc. Hey Taylor. How's football? Good. How's Nell? Oh, she's good. Said to say hi, if I saw you. Tell her I say hi back. I will. Get some rest, Doc. Taylor. Yeah. KARL: Oh, yeah, exactly, thank you. FEMALE VOICE: Yep. You leaving already? Not gonna stick around for a drink? DOC: No, I can't. KARL: Did they actually, let you through the front door with this outfit on? Yeah, I wish they hadn't, Karl. You look good though. You too. BILLIE: I'll call you tomorrow. Hey Doc, it's good seeing you man. You, too. KARL: Love you bro. I love Doc, don't you? I do. Hold on a sec. DOC: Talk to your client, Karl. Hey, Doc. Listen, uh... I just wanted to thank you, you know, I know how fucked up this all is and all that you do for us. I know it's not always pretty. Rich, Rich, Rich, it's me. Cut the shit, man. Listen to what Billie's saying. Back down on the Lalo thing, man, all right, I can't protect you, I can't protect your family. You worry too much. It's too bad we're not as close anymore. DOC: Is it? (CAR DOOR SHUTS) (CAR ENGINE STARTING) (CAR DRIVING AWAY) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (CELLPHONE VIBRATES) (DOC SCOFFS) Hello? CARLA: Are you sleeping? DOC: No. CARLA: Mm-hmm. DOC: What is it? CARLA: (SIGHS) I was calling to see if you'll be in court this week. DOC: (SIGHS) Yeah, I'm gonna be in court. Is that why you called? CARLA: Yeah. DOC: Oh. Look Carla, my bills are paid. I slept at home last night. Laundry's getting done over here. (BREATHES DEEPLY) You wanna let a judge decide, it's fine, I'm not gonna fight you on it. I just wanna be part of her life, okay? CARLA: Okay. DOC: Okay. Is there anything else? Because otherwise I have to get to work. CARLA: Yeah, where's work? DOC: (CHUCKLES) Okay. I'll see you in court. NELL: Hey Dad, it's me, just calling to tell you the presentation went great and everyone loved it. Um, I'll tell you more about it tomorrow, same time, same place? Love you. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) (DOOR BELL RINGS) (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) (DOOR BELL RINGS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Billie? (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) Call Clarke Moore. (LINE RINGS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) CLARKE: What Doc? We need to meet. CLARKE: Why would we do that? Cut the shit, Clarke. Put me through to Rich. CLARKE: Listen, Doc, whatever arrangement you had with the governor is gone now. Is that right? CLARKE: The governor has decided to end this relationship. He wishes you well. It doesn't work that way, motherfucker. Put me through now. CLARKE: There's nothing more to talk about, Doc. Clarke! Put me fucking through. CLARKE: I'm sorry, you're on your own now. (LINE CLICKS) Fuck, fuck! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) FERNAN: Three-thousand pounds in 48 hours... not bad. This is Cuco, he just came in from Mexico. I was sorry to hear about Riggs and her wife.

MAN 1: Great to see you, Rich. RICHARD: Good to see you. Hey, long time no see, how you been? MAN 2: Nice to see you. Good, good. So, what do we got? MAN 2: Well, we've got 1,500 pounds of dope and 11 million dollars seized. What's next? MAN 1: Well, now it's a question of you and your family's safety. We've upped your personal detail, but we need to be careful. (SIGHS) Move my wife and son out of the mansion. Put a team with them at all times, just until this thing calms down. I was so sorry to hear about Billie Riggs, sir. It's just terrible what happened. How do you figure she factors into this? I can't think of a reason. Do you know an associate of hers, by the name of Doc Alexander? Yes, yeah, I do. We have reason to believe that he is connected to the Prado organization. What makes you think that? MAN 2: Well, he was the only one that showed up for Prado's brother's execution. He also matches the description of an individual leaving the warehouse earlier today. Doc was my superior officer, we served together. I know him to be a troubled man. If you think he's connected to the Prados... we have to consider him dangerous... and do whatever we need to do to apprehend him. Okay. We ready? Hey, Rich, can you give me a second? What is it? I'll catch up. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Are we sure we wanna do this? I mean, you go back on camera... and we're at war. Clarke, we already are. What was that about Doc in there? Doc's on his own now. That's how this thing goes. Now we have to protect everything we've worked for. After that, we're clean. You knew this was gonna happen, didn't you? No, I didn't. People are dead, Rich. Look, Billie knew the stakes better than anyone. Emma? Those cops? It's horrible. But there's no going back, Clarke. And I'm really sorry about that. Right now, I need to know that I can count on you. (EXHALES) Hey, we are going to take on the Cartel and win, Clarke. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Let's go. It's all in here. Stick to the script. We're gonna get touched up. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Good evening, Oklahoma. CLARKE: He's traveling next week. No. Are you watching the press-- Education is fucking Oklahoma. No, he's running on crime. Yeah, well the numbers are the numbers. Look, I can't get into it. I got an early morning, I gotta jump. (EXHALES) (EXHALES) Oh, what the fuck? Who the fuck are you? Shut your fucking mouth. CLARKE: Okay, okay, okay. Please, please, please, don't hurt me, please. Put your hands above your head. What, why? Put your hands above your head now. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. (ZIP TIES RATCHETING) (CLARKE GROANS) Oh, my God, no. Okay, hey, listen, I'll do whatever you want. I'll get you anything you want just please don't hurt me. CUCO: Shh. (PANTS) CUCO: That's a good boy. Shh. (GRUNTS) What is going on? CLARKE: Hey man, look. Hey, I had nothing to do with it, with any of it, okay. I don't even know what's going on, I don't! I don't know. What does he think he's doing? Jeffs? Man, he wants to take on the Cartel. (CHUCKLES) CLARKE: Now people are fucking dying and... I just wanted to work in politics. (SOBS) Please. Where is he now? CLARKE: I don't know. But they just upped the security. I have an idea. Uncuff me and I can call him. Okay, I'll call him and we can set up a meeting, right away, I promise, I'll get you a meeting with him. Do you pray, Clarke? What? No, what the fuck does that mean? I'm gonna give you a minute to get right with God. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, please. Help me! Help! (SCREAMS) Help me! Help! No! (LIGHTER CLICKS OPEN) Please. No! (FLAMES WHOOSHING) Oh, my God!

You listen to me-- CUCO: No, you listen to me, okay? Doc. I need your help, Jefe. I came here to send a message. Now our money is gone, our men, our product. I had nothing to do with what you lost. CUCO: I believe you. (BIRDS CHIRPING) CUCO: But that doesn't change where we are. How long have you known Mr. Jeffs? I've known him 20 years, but I don't know him anymore. What do you want? CUCO: And I've read a lot about your state. They've executed a lot of people. And it's the only one that offers more than two forms besides lethal injection and electrocution. And they always start at the same time? I asked you a question. Midnight. CUCO: Midnight. That's what I heard. Kind of poetic. What do you want? CUCO: My father's people from the Southern part of Mexico, descendants of Mayans. For their culture, the greatest offering was the head of your enemy. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) I want the head of Richard Jeffs. Head? CUCO: Just the head. If you bring me what I want, I will give you the girl, that is the price for her life. Call this number when you have it. I'll give you instructions from there. I'm not gonna do a goddamn thing until I know she's okay. CUCO: Okay. Ask me something only she would know.

No, well we've got midterms and we're just not quite sure where the situation is at with timing and scheduling, but things are well. How about you guys? Um, Stace, I gotta call you back. What the fuck are you doing here? I had the cops at my door earlier, asking about you. What'd you do, Doc? Someone took her. Nell? What the fuck are you saying? Shh, I need you to be quiet. Who the fuck took her? DOC: I don't know. Where? Come, I need to talk to you, she'll be okay. CARLA: How did you-- I don't care what you have to do, you get her back. Do you understand? And you do it for her, Doc. Because once she's home, you will never see her again. I will make sure of it. (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) Yeah. CARLA: If they hurt her, I'll kill you myself. Like, I thought passing out drunk, letting our six-year-old girl wander into the streets was bad? (BIRDS CHIRPING) I hate you. (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) Do you hear me? I fucking hate you. Where's Andy? CARLA: He's at work. You can't tell him anything. He's my husband, he's not gonna know? All right, fine. But he-- he can't say a word. Who's he gonna tell, Doc? Nobody. Do you understand me, Carla?

(SIGHS) And they wanted to get married under the fireworks. We had a wedding for them on the dock. Riggs was the priest. (SIGHS) I was Taylor's best man. And you walked Nell down the aisle. (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) This is all my fault. You know, you were like a brother to me. I know. I'm sorry, Doc. I'm so sorry. (CHAINSAW MOTOR REVS) (CHAINSAW MOTOR REVVING) (CHAINSAW MOTOR REVVING) (CAR ENGINE IGNITES) (SIGHS) (CELLPHONE RINGS) CUCO: Yeah. DOC: It's done. CUCO: Oh, that's good. DOC: Where do you want me to meet you? (LIGHTER CLICKS AND FLICKS) DOC: Hello? (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) It sounds like you're at a party. (POLICE SIRENS BLARING) DOC: Let me talk to Nell. CUCO: I can't do that right now. DOC: I want to talk to my daughter. CUCO: Yo, relax. She's fine. I promise. (POLICE SIRENS BLARING) There's a little town near the border, called Del Rio. Do you know it? DOC: Yeah, East of El Paso. CUCO: That's the one. There's a motel there, The Royal Inn, come meet me there tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. Cuco, you lay your finger on my kid, I swear to God I'll kill you. (PHONE LINE DROPS) (POLICE SIRENS BLARING) Hello? (SNIFFLES) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) What the fuck? What is this, hun? I don't do whatever this is. Then why did you do that? I just wanted to fix my makeup and there she is. But I said... I said to you, do not-- What the fuck is going on, hun? Honey, you-- (GROANS) No. No! (WHIMPERS, GROANS) Don't hurt me, Cuco. Don't hurt me, Cuco. (GROANS, SOBS) Cuco. CUCO: Shh, shh. (GROANS) (SOBS) (GROANS) (PANTS) (SOBS) (CUCO BREATHES DEEPLY) (SOBS) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Fuck. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (RETCHES) (EXHALES) It's gonna be a long night. (WOMAN LAUGHING) CUCO: Someone had too much to drink. You have a good night. (PANTS) Oh, you fucking bitch. (CAR DINGS) DOC: Fuck. God damn it, Rich. (INHALES) (CELLPHONE VIBRATES) Hey. CARLA: Hey, where are you? I'm about to go get her. CARLA: Where is she? I can't tell you that, Carla. CARLA: Did you hear what happened to Richard? Yeah. I heard. CARLA: There was a girl in there with him, his press secretary, I think, it's all over the news. Deb is hysterical. But they won't tell her anything else. What's happening, Doc? Are you guys gonna be okay? Nell's a tough kid, Carla. CARLA: I know. She's gonna be fine, sweetheart. CARLA: Doc, listen, I'm sorry about what I said. I am still so angry with you and it drives me crazy that no matter what, she'll always love you more. You're her idol, Doc. She also knows what you're capable of. So wherever she is... I'm sure she knows you're coming. Look, I gotta go. I'll call you as soon as I have her, okay? CARLA: Doc? Yeah. CARLA: Please be careful. I always am. (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (DOOR SHUTS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Your papa's coming. I know. CUCO: You know? Your papa is a bad man. That's why you don't scare me. (LAUGHS) No? Mmm. Most little girls get really scared. Not you, huh? You shouldn't have killed that lady. But she didn't listen. She didn't listen to me. How can you do that? When was the first time you killed someone? When I was a boy. Younger than you. NELL: What happened? I was a bastard. My mother was an American... but she was also a lady of the night, you could say. My skin was lighter than all of my brothers, so no one believed I was a son of Antonio Prado. And my mother was a very beautiful woman. Beautiful. She died when I was 13. And my father, he always made sure I was taken care of. But his wife never accepted me. (INHALES) There was one boy in town... he called my mother a whore, the day after her funeral. So I followed him home that day and waited. That night I snuck into his room and cut his throat. What happened after that? No one ever talked about my mother again. And what about your dad? We became very close. And he knew what you did to that boy? My father knew everything that happened in his town. So you like it? I'm a good at it. (SCOFFS) Are you sick to your stomach now? I thought I didn't scare you. I don't like burgers without ketchup. (LAUGHS) The girl wants ketchup. (LAUGHS) MAN: Right there. That's where I saw him coming out of. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) It was a big girl, I mean, you saw him, right? He was coming out of that room right there. Fuck. Fuck. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Listen, you little bitch. Now, you say a word, I'm gonna shoot you in the fucking face. We're gonna go on a little ride. Have you ever been to Mexico? (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) Get in the fucking trunk. Hey, man, hold on. Call the fucking cops. Stop. Stop it. Hey, what are doing, bud? Who is this? He's not hurting you? FEMALE VOICE: Are you okay? What's going on? What the fuck. (GASPS, SCREAMS) (GUNSHOTS) Don't take another fucking step. (PANTS) Turn around. Turn around! You think I'm fucking around? Get your ass in the fucking trunk. (SPEAKS IN SPANISH) Oh, you fucked up, fool. (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) MALE VOICE: I don't know what's going on. I need you to send somebody over. The Royal Motel. Hold on, man. No please. DOC: What the fuck were you thinking with that girl? I mean, she knew about your wife and your kid. I didn't wanna fucking do her. No fucking choice. You fucking had everything. You fucking did. Golden boy. Now look at you. Fucking head in a bag, great. You know, I hadn't thought about that lake trip in years. I forgot about it. And the kids... married under the fireworks. God, that was a fucking-- God damn it, that was a great weekend. You know, I think that was the last time that Carla and I were in love. It was when I came back from that last tour, you remember? It was fucked up, man, I couldn't handle it. Something changed inside of me. You remember. I couldn't deal with anything. And then the whole husband and daddy thing, I mean, fuck me. Everybody was so fucking normal. I just saw some fucked up shit. You were running for office. (LAUGHS) And then the divorce, man. And you know, somehow I was the pariah. You know, nobody wanted to fucking deal with the basket case. Man, you were like my brother. Now look at this shit. Doesn't make sense. It's nice to talk. (POLICE SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE) DOC: Fuck. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Come on, you motherfucker. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Can I help you? What happened here? Back to your room, now. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Hey, you live here? MAN: Yeah, you could say that. What happened? I hear some potato murked them fools, man. Had a girl with him too. DOC: Is she alive? She was walking. DOC: Then what happened? They got in their whip and they went that way, dude. What way's that? Was it that way? Right, that way. What's that way? The fucking sandbox, homie. Mexico. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Mexico. Thanks man. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) (SIGHS) Going to Mexico. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (IN SPANISH) Fuck you, bitch. LALO: (IN SPANISH) LALO: (IN SPANISH) (IN SPANISH) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (CAR ENGINE REVVING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) DOC: Where's my daughter? She's fine. Why don't you go get her. We'll be on our way. I'm sorry, but the deal you made with my brother... I cannot honor it. I didn't make a deal... with your brother. He snatched my kid. LALO: Look... Doc... I know you were there when they executed Miguel. I'm grateful for that, truly. I've heard nothing but good things about you from him and the people who work for me. However... my brother here... who took your daughter... has caused a bit of a problem for me. I guess... he had you help him? I cannot have any of this... leading back to me or my business. I'm sorry. What about my kid, man? (CHUCKLES) Pacho. CUCO: Sit the fuck down. (WHIMPERING) It's okay, baby, it's okay. DOC: Just be still. CUCO: Let's go for a little walk. (INSECTS CHIRPING) DOC: It's okay baby, it's okay. You remember when you were a little girl... and the storms would come, and I'd tell you how to hide, you remember that? CUCO: Shut the fuck up. Let's do it right fucking here. (SOBS) (SOBS) (SOBS) (PANTS) CUCO: I'm sorry it had to happen this way. Little Dixie. Oh, I'm gonna fucking miss you. (SOBS) Shh. (SOBS) Now get on your fucking knees. (SOBS) Pacho. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) I thought you were a bad motherfucker. Just some old man. (LAUGHS) (SOBS) Pacho, sit him up, sit him up.
