'Twas the night before Christmas, all white with snow. But Santa was worried holiday spirit was low. You see, the people of Earth had quite a rough year, and few could muster up any holiday cheer. All those plain, dark houses were more than just a sad sight. The team at the North Pole was in a desperate plight. Without any candles or Christmas lights to show him the way, Santa would surely get lost in the dark on his sleigh. Santa cried out to Billy, his trusty secretary, "We need to raise everyone's spirits! They must be merry!" The elf made call after call, trying to gauge their holiday zest. But his friends weren't just feeling lackluster, they were super depressed. Season's greetings. How are you, Bette? I'm awful. It's been a horrible year. It's a year I'd like to forget. Happy holidays, Millie. Hope you're feeling merry and glad. Not really. I've tie-dyed everything I own, and I'm still feeling sad. Heidi, have you gone out walking in a winter wonderland? Gone out? Out of the house? I don't understand. [narrator] Billy had to save Christmas. He knew who held the key. A great friend of Santa's. The ultimate VIP. All right, guys. This is my favorite part. You ready? Three, two, one! Now Mommy's got a key light. Hey. You wanna put some ornaments on the tree, Little Mimi? I'm okay. I don't even see any other houses with Christmas decorations. What about your house? My family doesn't have a Christmas tree this year. Well, you think you can find a special place to put this one? It's my favorite. [phone chiming] Okay, guys. Wanna get your pj's on? [man] Come on, kids. You don't wanna be on the naughty list. Come on. Let's go. Come on. [line ringing] Hello? He needs me? [chorus vocalizing] Okay.

Oh, hi, Mariah Carey. - [Mariah] Hi. I'm Billy Kringle Jr., secretary and attaché to Santa Claus. Thank you so much for coming. I am a huge fan, by the way. Oh, thank you, thank you. The red phone rang. So, how bad is it? Holiday cheer levels are at the lowest we've ever seen. And peppermint stick consumption is way down. I don't know what we're gonna do. This is why we called you. Well, there is one obvious solution. A fashion show? Let's put on a fabulous Christmas concert and cheer up the world. You think we can pull that off in one night? Darling, if I can make 15 albums, raise two kids, write a memoir... Plus the audiobook. I love that. ...and work out in high heels... I think I can handle a show. [narrator] Mariah knew that she must help Santa, and she had a great plan to lift everyone's spirit all over the land. - I see you read my rider. - Oh, yeah. Top to bottom. I've got four wind machines on standby and enough glitter in the closet to fill a swimming pool. - Great. - Now, let's talk about this concert. Do you have a set list? Well, I know one song for sure, but then I'm gonna need some help. - Oh. - Yeah. Well, there's a lot of talent here in the North Pole. - Elves are all very musical. - Mm-hmm. I'll have you know, I have the only falsetto this side of the Gumdrop River. Okay. ♪ Hark are the bells, there go the bells I am the bells, you are the bells ♪ - ♪ We are the bells, you are the... ♪ - [chuckles] That's great. That's amazing. But I don't need a singer, Billy. I just need a musician. [sighs] Oh, well, today's your lucky day. [piano playing] Yeah. Or you could just use him, yeah.

Now we don't have much time, so I have to set a schedule and stick to it. Billy, I don't do schedules. Now, to really get in the "holly jolly" zone, I need to get cozy with a cup of cocoa. And get in front of the Peanuts. I'm sorry. Ever since Rudolph crashed into the satellite, - the reception's been terrible. - [squeaks] What was that? Woodstock! Come inside, you must be freezing! [Woodstock squeaks] Try a little bit more that way. Yes! Way to go, Woodstock! ["Linus and Lucy" playing] Linus, are you looking forward to a good Christmas this year? When you say, "good," Charlie Brown, do you mean am I looking forward to getting a lot of presents this year, or giving a lot of presents? Or perhaps you mean "good" as in am I looking forward to seeing new meanings in old things? - Or perhaps... - [sighs] Actually, I was just wondering if you were looking forward to a good Christmas, filled with fun things to do. I keep feeling that I'm missing something this year. Maybe it's ice-skating, Charlie Brown. It isn't the holiday season without a twirl around the old ice. [piano playing] Nice aim, Snoopy. [Woodstock squeals] [screams] See what you made me do? Perhaps what you're missing is a certain holiday decoration. Have you put up your Christmas tree, Charlie Brown? Have you hung up your stocking by the chimney with care? I don't think that's it, Linus. Our house is decorated, and my stocking is already hanging up. It's so Santa doesn't miss him. Oh. [piano playing] - That's it! - [Snoopy squeals] Sounds a little familiar, doesn't it? ["All I Want For Christmas Is You" by Mariah Carey playing] What I'm missing is the music. [vocalizing] Being together with your friends and singing holiday songs. Now that's what makes a good Christmas. ♪ Christmastime is here ♪ ♪ Happiness and cheer ♪ ♪ Fun for all that children call ♪ ♪ Their favorite time of year ♪ ♪ Oh, that we could always see ♪ ♪ Such spirit through the ♪ ♪ Year ♪ [squeaks] Okay, I've settled Mariah Carey into the cabin. Rudolph keeps ruining the TV. It's like, look, we get it. You have a red nose. We support you, but that's not a reason to drive everyone crazy. Anyway, the lady wanted to sing with me. She was practically begging. And I was like, "You know, now's not the time. You know, maybe another time." [sighs] Okay, she's taking a rest before the Christmas concert and... Wait, what? What is she doing in the toy factory? [groans] Why is she in the toy factory? She gonna stand there, making toys? What are the elves supposed to do? [narrator] Mariah had gone to the factory to watch the elves do their thing, but our girl couldn't help herself. She just had to sing. She wanted to put on a preshow to lift the toymakers' glee and knew the only thing better than one diva was listening to three. ♪ Oh, Santa's gonna come and make him Mine this Christmas ♪ [Mariah] I'm looking for J.

["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" playing] [Mariah vocalizing "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"] [vocalizing continues] [song continues] [song and vocalizing ends] Oh, my wonder. That was beautiful. [narrator] Mariah was intrigued by the forest. She thought it might inspire. But going off track again sent Billy's blood pressure higher. Wait, what? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, please, with the buttons. Why is she in the forest? I need to get her back for the concert! - Mariah Carey? Mariah Carey? - Mm-hmm? You are a very difficult woman to keep track of. It's called elusive, darling. Okay, well, we have to get back. I know a shortcut. Billy worried they were behind schedule. They had to get back. But his shortcut only led them way, way off track.

Mommy's sleeping. Should we wake her up? Mommy, wake up. I had the most wonderful dream. I was helping Santa with a show to bring Christmas cheer to the whole world, and you guys were there. Are you okay, Mommy? I'm fine. Hey, why don't you guys go get some more decorations for the windows? We gotta make sure that our lights shine so bright that Santa Claus can see them all the way from the North Pole. How do you know Santa's even looking? Because he told me.

In the middle of the show, the stage suddenly blackened. Billy and everyone were clearly distraught. But then Mariah had an incredible thought.

And as the crowd cheered, Santa took off on his sleigh, with the glow of holiday cheer lighting the way. It's been a tough year, and that's all the more reason for us to band together this holiday season. United, our futures can be hopeful and bright. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
