I told you that we talked about it Julian! Emotions are not like the annalect you can't wind'em up with some perfect little rubber logical ball and not expect to rubber bands to fall off You'd think I don't know that? I think you persuaded yourself that they do tie up and I'm think you've told yourself and this is where the arrogance comes in You've told yourself that if you're persuaded then we should be persuaded too. Oh, please don't hold back I just don't wanna see you get hurt, so stop it. Stop it now. before it's too late, Ju..... you know it's the same as Julian He thinks in me in the certain categories and he gets freaked up when I act outside'em.

Whatever you want, you had the practice Deserve that! Nah, You haven't even scratched surface of what you deserve. Elena and I never did any thing other than kiss Once.

Oh, Chalice! You look terrible. I just need to understand I will explain. Please come inside. It seems to make sense I was attracted to him I thought I can have what I wanted and no one needed to suffer. and then I met you We were never together before we were with you. That's what he told me. I thought I was going to make him happy I had this image in my mind of Julian and me with kids. I thought God How old we must seem to them?! Do you know what I mean? Sure. Then I imagine my older self thinking of you at that moment and knowing that at least there was one day one day when I had been wild I think we've all hurt each other enough Don't you? Ya, we have. pick up your phone Pick up your fucking phone Fuck it. ""I heard the creek, but you weren't listening"" ""this is bad, when was this...outclassed and outfucked"" ""You really are a pathetic....how dare you talk to me as you have some kinda position"" ""Jesus Chalice, I'm trying... well, try harder so we have said anything worth hearing"" ""You've lost Chalice"" ""Julian! what do you really want?"" Is she here? She is sleep. Come Julian. Come inside. What was I thinking? I'm so stupid. No. I remember when I told you I didn't want to cause problems between you and Chalice I'm so sorry, Julian. It's not your fault. I'm the reason that Chalice is gone. now there's just you two I don't even think theres that Is there any more tea in the pot? No, I'll get it. You know Elena? I never had tea till i started seeing Julian. I used to think that it was just a pretentious habit that he picked up in europe But now... ...I can't be without it!! This is a beautiful day! What do you say we go for a walk? I say... No talking until we get to the park. Thats rule number one We had one of those before, Remember? This time there were more. Go get dressed.
