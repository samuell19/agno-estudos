[Newsman] We interrupt this broadcast to bring you the latest report on Daphne Wood. She escaped from the state hospital in Camarillo three days ago, and was last seen in the hills of Silverado. A resident reported seeing a strange-looking woman fitting the description of Ms. Wood eating out of garbage cans. Ms. Wood is considered insane, but supposedly harmless. For those who remember, five years ago, she was committed to Camarillo for brutally beating to death the four-year-old son of Charlie Johnson, owner of Seacoast Delivery Express. Again, the woman is not considered dangerous or violent, but please exercise caution. The area has been searched without results, but the hospital would appreciate any information regarding her where. Charlie, isn't that the black that worked for you about five years ago? Yeah. Hey, man, let's not talk about that now, huh? Hey, finally got you to go huntin' with me, man. Let's relax, have a good time. Brucie, quit messing with that paperwork. Hell, man, you make 10 grand a year just insuring my rates alone, eh? Relax, have a good time. If I had the lettuce you do, Charlie, maybe I could relax. Hey, what did you rake in last year? Two hundred thou? Hey, naw, man, it was more like a million bucks. And I did it all on my own, huh? No hand-me-downs. Just this goes to prove that Jews ain't the only ones can make money. Hell, I didn't even finish high school, man. Hey, yeah, talking about high school. Hey coach, what kind of football team we gonna have this year, huh? I don't know. We're busing in a couple of black kids. All right. They could help us out. Damn niggers are taking over sports. Charlie, do you have to use that word? I thought you hired a couple of black drivers a month or so ago, Charlie. Yeah, well, if I wanted to get them damn government contracts, I had to hire some of them colored folks, huh! (laughing) Hey, Brucie, gimme another beer up here, huh? We're all out of beer, Charlie. [Charlie] Hey, Bobo, thought I told you to fill up that fridge when we left, huh? Here's a store. We can get it here. Oh, lookie there, huh? Get in there and get us a case of beer. - Okay. - There you go. Right away. Hey, Steve. You see if that cute little trick over there wants a ride, huh? You and your damn women. Hey, kid. Kid. What? We're heading for Arizona by way of San Diego. That help you any? San Diego would do me just fine. Get in the car. Open the damn door, Brucie. She's young. That's trouble, man. You wanna keep selling me insurance, you open that damn door now, huh? Stop pickin' on him, Charlie. Come on in, honey. (Cindy laughing) (ominous music) [Cindy] Hey, man. Thought you said we were going to San Diego. What are we turning off here for? [Charlie] Hey, I, uh, I gotta get some extra gears, just a couple of miles up the road, huh? Oh, shit! [Steve] Charlie, we got all the gear we need. What the hell are you up to now? [Charlie] Hey, Steve, we got ourselves a cute, little side attraction, huh? That beats hunting any day. [Steve] Are you nuts? [Cindy] Hey, you, where's that damn cabin you said was only a few miles up the road? [Charlie] Hey, don't worry, honey. We almost there. And that cabin is a hunting lodge in Silverado that I bought to entertain my trucking friend. [Cindy] Yeah, well, wherever the damn cabin is, (mumbles) I need to get to San Diego. Just lost my channel. She's drinking beer and she looks under 18 to me. Ah, Brucie, relax, man. Here. Chase this tequila with some of that beer, huh? It'll set you free. Charlie, have all the fantasies you want, but hands off that kid, I mean it. Hey, we all got bad manners here, huh? It's not nice to keep the lady of honor waiting. Give it to her, Brucie. There you go, sugar. That won't put any weight on you, huh? - Hey, Bobo. - Yeah? [Charlie] Pass some lime out of the fridge. Okay, boss. (Charlie laughing) That is the way you hippies like it, isn't it? [Bobo] Here's three. Go ahead, honey. It'll put some hair on your chest. (laughing) Hair on your chest. No, no, no, chicita. First, the tequila, and then the lime. I know. You do it your way, and I'll do it mine. You see, Brucie? This little chick wants to have fun just like we do, huh? Come on. Run this deal for a while, huh? I need to talk to this little lady. (Charlie laughing) There you go, sugar. Well, go ahead. It ain't gonna bite ya. (chuckles) How old are you, Cindy? 17. Hell, she's lying. She's 20 if she's a day, look at her. She is not lying, Charlie. We've gotta let up on this drinking. Hey, look, Steve, she's not the sweet 16 and never been kissed type, huh? With a body like she's got, I bet she's slept with plenty of fellas, ain't you, honey? Well, I bet you even slept with a nigger, huh? You ever sleep with one of them colored boys, hon? [Cindy] They're human just like you are, you creep. Hey, wait a minute. I'm putting my jacket on. How long have you known that bastard? That bastard happens to be my half brother. You know, he's not so bad when you get a chance to know him, I think. He may have a Boy Scout merit medal of honor, but I'm still scared of him. Steve, will you keep that animal away from me, please? Don't worry, half pint. I think I can handle him. ('70s rock 'n' roll music) Hey, I was wondering what happened to you two. What you trying to do, old buddy, keep this all to yourself? Charlie, what in the hell's goin' on here? Hey, I think I found somethin' you gonna like, huh? Hey, boy, gimme that thing there, huh? I know it's great stuff, but let's give Cindy a little here. Here you go, sugar. Some great pot I had up here I forgot all about. That oughta thaw you out a little bit, huh? Charlie, let's get whatever you came for and get the hell out of here. Hey, we got lots of time, fellas, lots of time, huh? Dammit, Charlie, I am serious. Okay, boss. - Come on. - Okay. Just kidding, huh, just kidding. Hey, Bo, get us another beer and change his booze. Then we'll get the hell out of here, huh? Did you hear what I said? Hey. Cindy, you better stop smoking. Charlie. Eh. Come here. Listen, I know what's on your mind, but this kid is not interested. Hey, relax. Honest broads like it better than we do, huh? (chuckles) Hey, boss, here's your Cerveza. (laughing) [Cindy] Hey, cowboy. Hey, honey. Where's the bathroom? It's right up them stairs, eh? Hey, no, no. That's all yours, all yours, eh? (group laughing) Charlie. Charlie. It's late. Come on, come on. It's late. Come on. Come on, it's getting late. Hey, Cindy. You're one mucho sex! (laughing) Whoa! Anything would look sexy to you, Bozo. (laughing) Nice to see you being a little more friendly. You creep! Hey, come on, huh? Creep? You know, you're cute. But you gotta to know we're not here to play Monopoly. You sicko! I wouldn't let you touch me with a 10 foot pole. Okay, Charlie, we are going right now. I'm gonna level with you right now. We ain't going nowhere till this bitch puts out. Puts out? You lay one hand on me, dude, and I'll see you spend the rest of your life in a cage! - What, you bitch! - Oh! Charlie, settle down! Quit it, settle down! Take out you're gonna ruin I'm trying to work out something for you. Okay? Hey, old Stevie boy had better break her in for us fast, huh? Because I am not a man to kept waitin'. Shit. Hey, boss. Do you want me to go get us some more beer? Nah. Get us more tequila, huh? Yeah, some more tequila. (laughing) You're not really serious about that girl? Oh, hell yes, Brucie. Maybe we'll just club sandwich her. Not when it's by force. That's rape. And about the time that he was gonna hit you, I, I decided I'd better do something fast. Get the hell out of my sight before I cancel all my insurance. All right, all right, but just tell me where. Up the stairs, dammit! Pick one out. I got plenty of them. Do anything in a small way. Hey, boss. Do you want me to stay or do you want me to go? Hey, Bobo, you're with me, huh, baby? As soon as old Stevie boy gets done in there, we're gonna have our little piece of the pie. (laughing) I'm with you, boss, whatever you say. (yawning) I gotta go check Charlie and see what's happening down there, okay? Okay. (cans clattering) Charlie's passed out in the living room. He won't wake up till morning. Well, we've got to wake him up. We could, but after what happened down there, I think it'd a lot safer if we just let him take the rest of the night to sleep it off. [Cindy] Well, it blows the hell out of me getting San Diego tonight. Yeah, I know, Cindy. You have to admit that you were partially responsible for what happened down there. I'll go now. You can get some sleep. Steve, I wouldn't trust him if he were dead. I just told you that it's gonna take the rest of the night for him to sleep it off. Won't you stay a little while longer, please? At least until we finish this dope. Fine, okay then. Stay for a little while. Okay. I can take that. You know, for 17, you seem a lot older. I'm only a few days away from 18. Besides, I was on my own when I was 12. And when that happens, you grow up fast. What's the matter? Does our age difference bother you? You know what you're doing, don't you? Yeah. Oh, Steve. Maybe it's this dope, but I really do feel warm and secure. Well, you do feel good next to me. (thunder clapping) (dramatic music) [Charlie] Hey. Hey, Bobo. All right, wake up, dude. Bo! (Bobo grumbling) Come on, it's our turn, eh. Let's go. (dramatic music) Hey there, honey. Ain't nobody gonna hurt you now. We just gonna put the finishing touches on what Steve already started. Don't touch me, you pervert! Where's Steve? (screaming) All right, Bobo, come on, man. I've been waiting for you all night. [Bobo] Just a second, all right? Damm it, Bobo! [Bobo] All right, all right, just hang on! (Cindy yelling) (dramatic music) I can't do it, boss. I just can't do it. I always knew you spics couldn't cut it. It's my turn now, Cindy baby. (Cindy screaming) Give it to me, honey. Spread your legs, damn it! Good, baby, oh! (grunting) (moaning) Hey, Charlie, man, that's enough. (Cindy crying) That's enough! [Cindy] No. (crying) Hey, man, I said that's enough! All right already, okay? Not till I'm finished now! (Cindy crying) (Cindy spitting) Bitch! (slap smacking) Hey, boss, man, no! You filthy bastard. You bigoted, perverted, filthy bastard! I'll get you, you pig! I ain't too crazy about you either, slut. (Cindy crying) (dramatic music) (Cindy crying) (Cindy screaming) (dramatic music) Hey, pile it high, huh, Bobo? I need plenty of refueling after last night. Charlie, what the hell is this? Looks like a pillow, my man. Yeah, with blood on it. Where's Cindy? Hell, I don't know, Steve. You're the one that serviced her last night, huh? Maybe she's still in the bathroom. I checked there. What do you know about this, Bobo? I, I, I don't know, Steve. Why, the last time I saw her, she went with you into the bedroom. Hey, my man. How did it go in there last night, anyhow, huh? Charlie, last night, you were ready to rape that girl. Now, this morning, she's gone. Charlie, you guys... I told you we don't know where she is. What the hell you so worried about that little slut for anyhow? I'm worried that three grown men might have done something stupid. Hey, don't include me, Steve. I went to bed. Don't include you in what, Bruce? You shut up, Bruce. Nothing, Steve. Nothing, hell! If you raped that girl last night... Steve, I didn't touch her. Charlie told me that he and Bobo were gonna club sandwich her after you got through with her, and if I didn't want her I should go to bed and... Dammit, Charlie! (fist banging) I wanna know why there's blood on that pillow and where the hell that kid is! Now, look, you stubborn Polack, you got your rocks off last night, didn't ya? You think you're the only one that wants to roll in the sack with that hot young stuff? Jesus, Charlie, yesterday, we picked up an innocent girl. Innocent hell! That girl's been around, and you know it. Let me tell you one thing, Stevie boy, that little whore serviced me and Bobo and the crack of dawn this mornin'. And she loved every minute she had me and Bobo. No, no, no, no, not in a million years. That kid was scared of you. She'd never let you touch her. Okay, baby. Okay. Now, I'm gonna give it to you just exactly like it was. Now, I didn't want to do this, 'cause you are not gonna like it. But she come out of that bedroom last night just mad as hell, yellin' and screamin', lookin' for you, sayin' how you had run out on her. Why hell, she woke me and Bobo up out of a sound sleep, man. And we are only human. What with her running around here stark naked and all. Besides, she was so mad at you last night, she'd have taken on a battalion. And then while we were doing it, she starts cussing, calling you names again, saying how men had always run out on her after they'd got what they wanted. Why, man, she got hysterical 'cause you ran out on her! And I had to wallop her just to shut her up. And that, my man, is where the blood got on the pillow. After that, she just got her things and got the hell out of here. You mean to tell me that all this happened because I went to sleep in another bedroom? Now, you just ask Bobo, huh? You tell him, Bobo. Ain't that the way it happened? Yeah. You know, if you're lying to me, Charlie... Steve, I ain't got no cause to lie to you. We're blood kin, man. The little tramp. Don't let her come between us. Look, man, you don't know nothin' about her, except she was easy enough for you to sleep with the first day you met her. That ain't nothing she hadn't done plenty of other times with them hippie friends of hers. Now, she is probably in San Diego and we are supposed to be in Yuma. Hey, forget her. It's like I always said. A broad's place in this world is on her back, huh? Let's have some breakfast and hit the road, then. Now, let me, let me get this straight. You're in the bedroom. You're on the bed. You're smoking marijuana and nothing happened. Now, Cindy, I don't buy that and a jury's not gonna buy it. [Cindy] But Steve didn't rape me. But he did have intercourse with you, right? Right? Yes. He committed a crime. And we're going to include him in the report. Do we have to do that? I practically begged him to make love to me. I was afraid that if left me alone, Mr. Johnson would come back in and rape me. Johnson did come in and rape you. Where was this Steve Merrick then? I don't know. I guess he left when I fell asleep. Cindy, what makes you think that Steve Merrick didn't set you up for Charlie Johnson? I never thought of it that way. But Steve still didn't rape me. Come over and sit down. Cindy, if you admit to being a willing participant with one of these men, it's gonna be easy for Charlie Johnson's attorney to convince a jury that you were a consenting adult with Charlie Johnson. I wouldn't consent to holding hands with that creep! I want him crucified for what he did to me! (crying) Okay. Then we go after all four of them, including Steve Merrick. They'll have no choice but to draw up charges against Charlie Johnson. Thanks. Oh, sure, cops any time. Don't tell me the DA wants to do an old number on me again? This guy's a real comedian. You're in a lot more trouble than you think, pal. Johnson, we got a warrant for your arrest. What? I said, we have a rape warrant, listing Cynthia Langley as the victim and you as the suspect. See that! We also have one for one of your employees. A Roberto Marino. Does he work with you on this lot? Hey, what part didn't you understand? Does he work here? Yeah, he works here, all right? Good, then answer me, then. All right, I'll, uh, I'll get Roberto in here and we'll follow you guys down. Oh, you'll follow us from the back of our unit. Let's go, you. Get Marino in here and you're both comin' with us right now. Rita. Get Bobo in here. I'm calling my lawyer. [Cop] At the station. I'm allowed one phone call! One phone call when we get your white ass to the station! Come on, man! Hey, Bobo! Yeah, what is it, sweetheart? Charlie wants you. Yeah, just a second. No, now! Oh, all right. Just a damn minute here. You're that crazy broad's brother. Rita, you get Jake Moore on the phone and you tell him to meet me over at the jail. I'm getting busted in here! I'm gonna put the cuffs on that redneck bastard myself! I'd bust his ass right now if it wouldn't mean trouble for the DA in court! You wanna see me, boss? Roberto Marino, you're under arrest. Charge him. Hey, boss, now what is this, huh? [Charlie] Just keep your mouth shut, Bobo. I'm gonna handle this, all right? But god, Charlie, man, you told me to do it. What about Maria and the kids, huh? Relax. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right the presence of an attorney. If you desire an attorney and cannot afford one, one will be appointed for you in questioning. Now, do you understand the rights I've explained? You don't have to understand nothing, speed lover, 'cause ain't nothing gonna happen, do you understand that? Pig! Rita, did you get a hold of Jake, yet? Yeah, he's on his way over to the jail right now. Charlie, what's going on? I'm goin' to a picnic. What the hell you think's goin' on, huh? (soft instrumental music) You told me what you did to that girl would never come out in the newspapers! What have you done to me? But Charlie promised me that his friend would keep it out of the paper. Well, read it, you horny worm. Your name is smeared all over the front page. Seacoast Delivery, can I help you? One moment, please. Seacoast Delivery, just a moment, please. Seacoast Delivery, hold please. Just a moment. Seacoast Delivery. (phone ringing) Hold please. Can I help you? (phone ringing) Answer the damn phones, Rita! (phone ringing) Dammit, Charlie, I'm trying! You've become a very popular man. Well, that kind of popularity I don't need, huh? Now, you just tell them what I told you. I ain't here! Steve's on line two. You wanna talk to him? (phone ringing) Yeah, you seen this morning's paper? What the hell do you think I'm lookin' at? I thought you had a friend that was gonna keep this out of the papers. Look, there would be nothing to take care of if you hadn't raped that girl. [Charlie] Hell, I'm telling you I didn't rape her, hoss. You didn't rape her, she burns you too. Now, that should tell you what kind of cheap whore we're dealing with. Listen, after the hearing tomorrow morning, maybe you should just take a little vacation. Go on up to the lodge and start working on that novel you always wanted to write. The hell are you talking about? I got a job, remember? [Charlie] Take a month's leave of absence. Give this thing a chance to cool down, huh? Go on up to the lodge. You always were a loner, anyway. I'm not sure I ever wanna see that place again. [Charlie] Don't give me that, my man. I know how much you love that lodge. I'll be real busy here tomorrow with this hearing and all. But you just get your butt over here. Tomorrow night, I'm gonna have that four wheeler all gassed up and ready to go. I don't know. No. No, I'm not running away from something I didn't do. Look, I'll see you tomorrow morning at the hearing, okay? [Charlie] Yeah, okay. [Bruce] Jean, bring me the file on the Lambert shopping mall. Mr. Lambert is due here within a few minutes. Mr. Lambert canceled his appointment just before you got here. But he said it was urgent to get this coverage immediately. Well, if you'd read the newspapers, you'd know why. I've read the newspaper, Jean. Please go back to your desk. Back to my desk, well, what for? How do you intend to pay me from prison? Prison? But damn it, I'm not guilty. Well, then why do they say that you are in the newspaper? The newspaper says I've been accused. That doesn't mean I'm guilty. Well, try telling that to Mr. Lambert! (door slamming) (solemn instrumental music) Morning, Jake. [Jake] Hello, Charlie. You want some coffee? No. Any scotch around here? That is the last thing you need right now. From what you've told me about all of you taking turns with her, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna try and get your charges reduced to illegal intercourse, which means she was a consenting minor. The hell you mean, consenting minor? We're pleading not guilty to this thing, aren't we? Charlie, my contact in the DA's office tells me John Stark has too much circumstantial evidence, which puts her in that lodge most of the night. Now, the way I see it, you'll have no choice but to admit she was there. I can assure you, no jury is gonna believe you were playing Tiddly Winks most of that night. You're gonna have to admit to some kind of sexual contact with her. Oh, Jesus, Jake! I can't let that little bitch put me behind bars! That's just my point, Charlie. If you plead guilty to a charge of illegal intercourse, it should bring you suspended sentences, as opposed to five to 10 for forcible rape. No, I don't know. I shouldn't have any problem making a deal with the DA's office to the lesser charge. Look. If you all stick together, it's just her word against all four of you. Okay, Jake. Whatever you say, huh? Listen, I'm picking up the tab for all of us on this thing, so nobody blinks an eye unless I okay it in triplicate, huh? Whatever. Look, I want you to represent all of us on this thing. (phone ringing) Well, that isn't customary, but if I'm gonna represent all of you, I should see the others before the hearing tomorrow morning. I'm gonna Stark this afternoon. It's gonna be difficult to work them in. Hey, well, seeing that primping DA's more important, isn't it? Why can't I just fill you in on everything you need for that hearing tomorrow? Charlie, are you leveling with me? Did that girl really jump in the sack with all of you? Hey, relax, hoss. It was, uh, like freebie day in the ice cream parlor, huh? Just remember, it's your neck in the noose, not mine. Okay, where'd you pick her up at? Well, there was this liquor store up on Dennison Avenue. I don't believe you. You mean to tell me you're willing to ruin four men's lives? Their families humiliated, their professions destroyed just to get back at Charlie Johnson? Look, I am thoroughly convinced that Charlie Johnson did forcibly rape her. But you're charging all of them with forcible rape! I'm seeing a side of you I don't like. Look, Stark! I have four respected citizens who claim she's lying. All you've got is her word. You haven't got a chance, Moore, and you know it. She gave us the license number of the motor home, plus an accurate description of the route taken to the lodge and of the interior. We also have, uh, witnesses who saw the girl soon after the assault. The alleged assault. That's all circumstantial. She didn't even go for a medical exam within 48 hours. She was in a state of shock. You know damn well the police report covered that. And you damn well know that forcible rape is hard to prove if the girl doesn't have physical evidence or a witness at the scene to back up her story. Last chance, Stark. My clients are willing to admit illegal intercourse if you make a deal for suspended... As I said before, no deal. They're goin' on trial as charged. (sighing) Okay, hot shot. It's your career on the line, not mine. But I'll make you look so bad in court they'll have you sweeping these halls instead of occupying the governor's office after the next election. And you can count on it! Screw the lawyer! I had a million dollar insurance on policy a shopping mall canceled. My business and reputation are gonna be ruined and there's nothin' that you or your lawyer can do about it! (dramatic music) (crying) That one sweet little bitch whore is gonna be sorry she ever messed with Charlie Johnson. (dramatic music) I came here to talk to you, but I can see you're in no condition to discuss anything. Just leave me alone! That's just what I intend to do! I've been talking to Hilda, and I'm filing for divorce. I'm gonna take what's mine before you give it to some high price attorney to keep you out of prison. But Charlie's paying all the lawyer's fees, everything. Loretta, you're all I have left. If you divorce me, I'll... Get your hands off me. (Bruce crying) That's right, cry, you little weasel. It's too bad you didn't finish the job when you tried to kill yourself two years ago. My god. You're not really serious, are you? You're damn right I'm serious! It would save me a lot of trouble! Go on back to your booze. The next time you talk to me, it will be through my attorney. (crying) (screaming) (crying) (dramatic music) Merrick. Steve. No one answered the front door, so I came round the side. What are you doing here so early in the morning? It was necessary for me to see you. Well, make it quick. I gotta be at the courthouse in about an hour. Oh, darn it, Steve, why did you do it? How the heck did you get in this mess? Oh, look, Mel, spare me your sanctimonious theatrics and just tell me what the hell you want. I, I hate like heck to be the one to have tell you this. But the school board held a special meeting and they decided that you be suspended. Suspended indefinitely without pay until this terrible thing is cleared up. Now provided... They decided I'm guilty before the verdict is even in? (dramatic music) I'm late because I was out looking for another job. I'm going to need one. (buzzer buzzing) (dramatic music) Didn't you hear me? (gasping) [Jake] Charlie, you'd better get to Bruce fast. [Charlie] Why? Charges have been dropped against Bruce Fowler. The hearing won't be until next week. The hell are you talking about? It's simple. Stark has dropped charges against Fowler because he intends to use him as a state's witness. Aside from that bastard wanting to be governor, why is he out to railroad you into San Quentin? Hey, don't you remember? We made a fool out of him a couple years ago when he lost that fraud case against me. Oh, yeah. You laughed in his face right in front of the judge. You think that little wimp would actually try to make a deal with the DA? Knowing Bruce, (chuckles) no, he'll testify to anything Stark wants and Stark knows it. We'll see about that, huh? Now, you tell Bobo there's no hearing this morning. I'll phone Steve, okay? Yeah, fine. You know, Charlie, I think Bruce Fowler blinked an eye without getting an okay from you, in triplicate. If you had had half the chance, you'd have fallen all over yourself to get it on with her. She was still 17. And you did not conform to the laws of our society. That 17-year-old girl was one week from bein' 18. She looked and acted 25. She wanted me to make love to her. So you can take your society crap and stick it! Okay, coach. Now, we have Christmas vacation coming up. By the first of the year, maybe these lawyers will have you out of this terrible mess. You said some pretty harsh things to me this morning. But I want you to know that, well, for one, I'm in there pulling for you. Just hang in there, old buddy. Your kind of pulling, I don't need, old buddy. Now, you have done your good deed. And get your ass out of here. Okay, okay, fine. If that's the way you want it. You have everything coming you deserve! That son of a bitch Brucie blew himself away last night. What? (laughing) Well, there goes the DA's star witness. Yeah, well, how's our chances look now, huh? Still gonna be nip and tuck, Charlie. Let me give you a word of advice. You'd better make damn sure Steve and Bobo stay on the right side of this thing. Hey, Steve's my brother. And I got Bobo in my hip pocket, huh? Well, you'd better be right, because if you don't Have their support, you might as well get used to a new address. Yeah, Jake. I see what you mean. Daddy, I just found out this afternoon the insurance man killed himself. Honey, I, I don't know about that. But I do know you have to eat. Eat? I don't believe you, Daddy. Didn't you hear me? Bruce Fowler killed himself! Don't you understand? A man is dead! It was my fault! The hell have you been? I've been trying to reach you all day. I took a drive up the coast. I had some thinking to do. Yeah, what about? Well, for openers, I got a suspension notice this morning from the school board. Hey, forget that damn school, huh? You never made any money there anyhow. And where you ought to be is up at my lodge doing some writing, huh? Guess you heard about Bruce. Yeah, I heard. Jake Moore called me this morning and told me the hearing had been pushed up. What the hell's wrong with Bruce? Why is he turning state's witness? There is a little more to it than that. Like what? Brucie killed himself last night, man. Bruce killed him? Jesus, Charlie, this stupid mess you're getting us into is really gettin' out of hand! Look, man, it is not my fault about Bruce, huh? That was that lame brain Stark's idea. And the only reason he charged Bruce in the first place was to try to scare him into testifying against us. So if you've gotta blame somebody for Fowler's death, you blame Stark! Well, I got news for you, Charlie. He's got me scared. Maybe I should turn state's witness. How would you like that? Come on, Steve. Look, I know we've had our differences over the years, but we're brothers. We gotta stick together in this thing. Besides, Jake tells me after what Stark pulled with his dropping the charge routine with Brucie, if he tries that with any of the rest of us, he's gonna get laughed right out of court. I don't know about that. But I'll guarantee you one thing. And you can make book on it. I do not intend to go to prison for something I did not do. Hey, you're not gonna go to prison at all, man. I'm personally gonna see that you get out of this thing, huh? Yeah. Come on, let's have another drink. You know, I think I might take you up on that offer for the lodge. Go up there for a few days to get my head cleared. There you go. I got my four wheeler all gassed up and ready to go for you. Go on up to the lodge. Get started on that novel you always been wantin' to write, huh? Hell, stay as long as you like. I'll handle everything down here. You may never have to come back. I'm gonna have to come back for the trial. Maybe not. I, uh, got me an idea. If it works out, we may never have to go to trial on this thing. Look, Charlie, do me a favor and leave well enough alone. You've got us in enough trouble already. Yeah, okay, hoss. Listen, get your mind off this mess, huh? Get going to that lodge up there. You bring your stuff? Yeah, I got some stuff in the car. (Charlie mumbling) Out in the lot, here it is. There you go. Just one thing, Charlie. Anything happens down here, you call me, okay? Yeah. (soft acoustic guitar music) The hell you doing here so late? (crying) I ain't got a home anymore. So I thought I'd sleep here till I go to jail. You ain't going to jail. And this ain't no YMCA, you know. Boss, don't you care what happens to me anymore? I got, it's like a legal order to keep me from coming home and from seeing my kids. Maria's never going to let me come home just because of what you made me do, man. Christ, man, can't you get it through that thick spic head of yours that I am sick and tired of hearing you whine about your woman? Bobo, broad is just like a bus, huh? Miss one, there'll be another one by in about 10 minutes. Look, Charlie, don't talk about Maria like that. You know, she's the mother of my kids. Hey, hey. Your wife locks you out of your home, won't let you see your kids, she ain't worth the powder to blow her to hell. Charlie, look, man, I'm warning you! Don't talk about Maria like that. Hey, there is a chain of command around here, grease monkey. You are on the bottom. Okay, Charlie. If that's the way you want it. Just remember, I know what really happened. And there might be some other people who would like to know that too. What? You just keep your mouth shut. (dramatic music) (buzzer buzzing) Yeah. [Receptionist] Mr. Stark, Cindy Langley is here to see you. Well, uh, have her come in. Hello, Cindy, sit down. Mr. Stark. Look, I'm glad you came. There's something I want to talk to you about. Remember the farmhouse you called your father from? Mr. Stark, I've changed my mind. I've decided not to go through with this. Now, wait a minute. Look, you can't just walk in here and... (men chatting quietly) Look, Joey, we had a problem going through there the last time. Don't you remember? Hey, Joey, how you doing, eh? Sit, Charles. You know, there's nothing wrong with my memory. But there's something wrong with your mouth. It's open when it should be shut. Now, you just do what I tell you. I've been expecting you, Charles. Hey, listen, Joey. There's no sense beating around the bush, eh? Now, look, I know you've had you lay some muscle on for me before, but this time, things are really serious. I got my brother talkin' turnin' state's evidence on me and my mechanic's givin' me a big hassle, too. I know more about this kid than you do, Charles. Look, Joey, all I know is that little whore is on my mind all the time. And I want her off my mind, permanently! Cindy, are you being threatened in some way? No. I've just been so miserable since I filed those damn charges. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I... What happened to the girl who wanted to put Charlie Johnson behind bars? I don't believe you. Bruce Fowler killed himself. Doesn't that bother you? You and I killed him. Oh, that's ridiculous, Cindy. We have a police report on Fowler said he tried to commit suicide two years ago. He was an unstable person. Look, I've made up my mind, and this time, you're not gonna talk me out of it. I just wanna drop this whole damn thing. Well, I'm afraid it's out of your hands. Once you file the information, the state of California presses the charges. Well, maybe so. But you're not gonna have much of a case without my testimony, are you? Cindy. You realize, of course, that we can hold you for perjury in contempt of court? Perjury? You've gotta be kidding talking to mean about perjury! If I were you, I'd give it a little thought as to how you made me lie about Mr. Fowler and Steve raped me when they didn't. How would you like it if I said that when you make me testify? Cindy, nobody made you do anything! Now, look. I am just trying to prosecute this case to the best of my ability. All right. Kid's a free spirit. Hitchhiker, right? [Charlie] Yeah. Well, she could very easily disappear, never be heard from again. [Charlie] Sounds good. Tell me more. Cost you 20,000. 10 up front, 10 when the job's done. It's no problem at all. When would I meet this guy that's performing this... You don't! You see, Charles, that's why you're in this mess, because you're stupid. Even I don't know who carries out the job, and that's the way I like it. I make the deal on the phone. I mail the money and a file to the post office box and forget it. That way, nobody could put the finger on anybody. Now, do you capisce? Yeah, Joey. I like the way you do business. Damn it, though, I just wish we didn't have to waste this kid. (dramatic music) Well, you can't have it both ways. (dramatic music) What's it gonna be? Okay, Joey. Okay, I'll, uh, I'll have the money for you tomorrow, all right? I'll be in touch. Well, uh, I'll see you tomorrow. Cindy, I still think you're feeling threatened in some way. Fowler suicide's bothering you. Why don't you sleep on it? I'm sure you'll change your mind. No way. (dramatic music) Yeah, get Jake Moore on the phone. Okay. Someone has been threatening Cindy Langley, and she wants to drop charges. Now, uh, I'm not gonna let her, of course, but I'm getting fed up with wet nursing this kid, and I've decided, well, I might reconsider your offer. That was last week. This is a new week and a new deal. If that kid has decided to drop charges, you're in trouble and you know it. Look, I will either lessen the charge to illegal intercourse or go all the way with additional charges of Johnson threat attempts. You think Charlie threatened her? He nearly broke her jaw once already. (laughing) That stupid lover boy? You're really grabbing for straws. I can see what's happening. That swinging little miss is beginning to feel guilty about your railroading Charlie, so she's decided not to cooperate with you. Face it, Jack, you're out on a limb that's about to be cut off. I am telling you, Moore, if I find out that Johnson threatened or bought out that kid, I'm gonna get him if it takes me the rest of my life. Ah. I think our next governor should be giving more attention to making damn sure he hasn't done anything illegal behind my client's back. Good news, Charlie. The hell are you so happy about? I've got our reigning Adonis running scared. And he's dropping all charges. Are you putting me on? I most certainly am not. All right, Jake! We did it! (laughing) All right! Woo, that's fantastic. But first, you haven't done anything to threaten or bribe that kid, have you? No. No, why do you ask me that? Because John Stark is going to have a no show with the Langley girl. He's blowing in the wind, of course. But he's implying that you coerced her in some way. No. Hell no. I wouldn't do something stupid like that. So we got Stark on the run, huh? [Jake] Yeah. Well, I'm gonna sue that prima donna for false arrest. Forget it, baby. Just consider yourself lucky on this one. I wouldn't press it. Let me say this, though. You just better hope she doesn't run in front of any cars for the next few days. Well, I was in the neighborhood and I wanted to give you the good news in person. See you around. Hey, listen, Jake. That kid's hitchhiking all the time. I mean, uh, what if something happened to her? What if she just disappeared or somethin'? Hell, I can't be responsible for her actions. Charlie, listen to me, and you listen good. From now on, nothing. And I mean nothing better happen to that girl. Yeah. Sure, Jake. (dramatic music) Joey, we gotta stop this thing, man. Hey, slow down, pal. You're gonna give yourself a heart attack. What's so urgent? Look, we gotta stop your operator. All right, come on. Joey, I'm tellin' you, you've gotta find a way to stop this thing. That will be difficult, my friend, if not impossible. I'm surprised the deed hasn't already been done. Maybe it has. Why you want to call it off? Because she's dropping the charges, and the DA thinks that I'm doin' a number on her. Now, look, you can keep the 10 grand, but you gotta get this thing called off. Hey, that 10,000's already gone. Okay, then, I'll give you the other 10 grand. I don't care. Look, Jake Moore says if this chick gets wasted now, I am really in trouble. All right. But I can't guarantee anything. Like I told you before, Charlie, I never see the man or men who carry out these things. Now, that's a long shot. Hey, look. You go back to your rigs and you do what you do well, making money, and I'll see what I can help you spend it, okay? Okay. Come on, let's get out of here. [Charlie] Sure, Joey. You did what? [Charlie] Hey, I paid a ton of money to see that she disappeared before the trial. I was doing it for all of us. So what's the problem? Call the damn thing off. That's just it, I can't. I mean, I tried, but wheels are already turnin'. I need time to find ways to stop it. Hey, wait a minute here. I got me an idea. You could talk to her. [Steve] I could talk to her? You're crazy. The hell I am. You're good with words. And she likes you. If you could just, uh, get her back into your confidence again, then you can talk her into goin' somewhere with you. I'd have time to call this contract off. Hell, uh, the two of you could take a cozy little trip to Hawaii or something. I'll pay all the expenses. [Steve] Why the hell should I stick my neck out? 'Cause we're brothers, man. [Steve] Half brothers. Yeah. Yeah, okay, Steve. Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do, huh? You do this thing for me, and I'll, uh, I'll give you the deed to that lodge up there, free. I don't know. If I tell her that you made arrangements to have her killed, she just might go to the police again. Get her to liking you first. Turn on that charm of yours, huh? I know, don't even, don't even tell her about that contract. I mean, just tell her I was gonna have her roughed up a little bit, huh? Look, we've got to take this chance. If anything happens to that girl now, we're in big trouble. [Steve] You mean you are. Hey, look, man. Now, we were all in this hook together. And if that girl gets killed now, we are all goin' to jail. Now, you gonna help me get out of this or not? [Steve] I don't even know where she lives. Hey, I got all that stuff, huh? Well, I'll go and talk to her, but I am not promising anything. Give me Cindy's number, and I'll see what I can do. You know, Charlie, for a smart man, you can really screw up. Where are you calling from? I'm about two blocks from your home at a phone booth by a restaurant here called the Victoria Station. I know the restaurant. What are you doing there? It's important that I talk to you. Steve, you know I'm not going to court against you, don't you? I'm so sorry I've caused you any problems. [Steve] Cindy, I know you've dropped the charges. And there's a couple of things that I want to discuss with you later, but right now it's important that I talk to you about something else. I was wondering, would it be possible for you to come over here? You mean right now, this minute? Believe me, Cindy, when I tell you, it is extremely serious. Okay, I'll come right away. Okay, I'll see you in a little while. Bye. (soft instrumental music) (dramatic ominous music) ♪ A man who's paid up all his dues ♪ I've not forgotten ♪ I've scraped the bottom Hi, Steve. Hi, half pint. I remember the first time you called me that. Yeah, I remember too. Only too well. I'm really sorry, Steve. The DA convinced me I had to testify that you raped me if I wanted to be sure Charlie would go to prison. Cindy, you have got to believe me. Cindy, look at me. I honestly thought that Charlie had passed out for the night or I would never have left you alone. The only reason I left in the first place was because I didn't want Charlie to wake up and find us together. [Charlie] Why is it so important I come over here right away? You said it was serious. It is serious, Cindy. There's a possibility that there's some, damn it. Tell me what, Steve? Can I get you something? - Tell me what? - Miss? Uh, yeah, a screwdriver. Would you like anything else? No, I'm fine. What are you trying to say to me? Steve. Cindy, I left you alone that night when you were depending upon me. Would you be willing to put your trust in me one more time? I purposely came onto you that night so you'd stay with me. I know that. That night was a chain reaction of errors committed by all of us. Give me your hand, half pint. Charlie paid a large sum of money in exchange for a guarantee that you would not appear in court. You mean that son of a bitch was going to have me killed? He's crazy! (crying) Cindy. Honey. It's okay. Cindy. Cindy. Listen, listen. Look. You okay? Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. You sure? Look, the important thing is to find a place for you to hide until Charlie can get through that stupid chain of command, get this damn thing called off. There might be somebody out there right now waiting to kill me. I think I should go to the police. Cindy, you did that once, and look what happened. Just tell me what to do. I came, half pint, and this time, I won't leave you alone. I believe you, Steve. I'll do whatever you say. Okay. Well, we've got to find a place for you to hide. You said you moved to the country. I'm staying at Charlie's lodge up in Silverado, you know the place. If we could be sure that Charlie wouldn't come up, wouldn't that be a good place for me to hide? Yeah. You know, you, you never cease to amaze me. Do you think you could handle that place? Sure, no problem. What about me? Hey, it'd only be for a couple of days. I'm, uh, sure we could stay out of each other's way for at least that long, couldn't we? (laughing) I'm sure we could. What would you tell your parents? Oh, that's the easiest part. They're so involved in their own problems, my putting my backpack on and saying I'm going to LA, staying with friends, wouldn't bother them at all. But, uh, you think that creep would call first before he decided to come up? Oh, I don't think we have to worry about Charlie at all. He's gonna be too busy trying to get the hit called off. That's a damn lie, that son of a bitch. You know, I still think I should blow the whistle on that schmuck. Cindy. Cindy, now you listen to me. If you do anything to get back at Charlie, it is going to boomerang on me. Now, is that what you want? God, no, Steve. That's the last thing I want. I've already caused you enough trouble already. Okay. Then let's go to work on protecting you. Now, if you're already being followed, I think I've got a plan. We can lose him. This is like right out of a movie. Well, let's just hope that this movie has a happy ending. Now, here's what I want you to do. (suspenseful music) Just pull up here and let me out. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) Hi, Steve. (suspenseful music) (soft instrumental music) (suspenseful music) Charle's a creep. But this place is really something else. Glad you like it, half pint, 'cause it's gonna be your home for the next few days. (dramatic music) Okay, bacon and eggs it is, then. Okay. Just give me a few minutes to find out where everything is. (laughing) (soft instrumental music) Hi. Hi. [Cindy] I just finished the dishes, thought I'd come down and see you. Good. [Cindy] What you doin'? I'm working on the novel. [Cindy] You know, I used to do some writing, too. But I've never had anything published except for in a high school newspaper. [Steve] Maybe you can help me while you're up here. [Cindy] Steve, I'd love to. Cindy, there's something I want to ask you that needs clearing up for me. The night that we were here, did you come running out the bedroom screaming hysterically that I had let you down? No, why would I do that? Are you sure? I don't know what Charlie told you about that night. But he and Bobo did rape me. Steve, you probably know that man better than anyone else. What makes him hate women and black people so much? (Steve sighing) You have a right to know after what Charlie did to you that night, maybe to make it easier for you to handle it. I doubt it. I don't think anything ever will. About five years ago, Charlie was having this affair with a young black girl. He brought her up here quite a bit. Actually, she was a mulatto passing as a white. Charlie was married at the time. And his son was four or five years old. And I guess the girl fell in love with him. At least, that's what Charlie said. Though how anybody could fall in love with him, I don't know. Anyway, she wanted him to leave his wife and he refused. This girl must have been extremely vindictive, because she somehow got to Charlie's son, to beat him up, but accidentally killed him. Well, I mean to you, Charlie went wild. And he beat the holy hell out of that girl. The girl was committed to a state hospital in Camarillo. Charlie's wife left him, took him for a small fortune. Hey, let's get off the subject. It's giving me goose bumps. Would you like to go for a hike before it gets dark? Not tonight, half pint. It's been a big day rescuing you from the bad guys. Come on, let's go back up to the lodge. (dramatic ominous music) [Cindy] How long you gonna stay here? The rest of my life, I hope. Do you have enough money not to work? Yeah. I got enough money to last me for about a year. Anyway, I intend to sell that novel that I've been writing. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I've had a couple published. Short stories. Did anybody buy them? Yeah. About 10. (laughing) You know, Steve, I really love this place. Yeah, it is nice. But it's so isolated here. Don't you ever get scared here all alone at night? There was, last night, in fact. I went for a walk in the woods and when I came back, it was getting late. And I came across this strange, weird, bushy-haired thing that was going through the garbage can. I yelled at it and scared it off, but I mean to tell you, I have never in my entire life ever been scared like that before. That must have been what I saw here that night when I ran out of here. It was kind of dark. And it was far away. It was really wild and crazy. There's nothing out there. Hey. Everything's okay. (dramatic music) (dog whining) (dramatic music) It's time to go to bed. Are we gonna sleep together? Do you really want to? Mmm, yeah, I do. What do you think? I think that we should wait and see what tomorrow brings. Okay. Come on, I'll show you the bedroom. (dramatic ominous music) (screaming) (crying hysterically) Calm down! Honey, calm down. Hey, what's going on, you crazy dope? Now that she's legal, you got her back in the sack, huh? Knock it off, Charlie. What in the hell is going on? What, what is Bobo doing here? Hey, I brought all them with me in case I need an alibi. She got blown away or somethin'. Now why didn't you two go to Hawaii like I told you? Because you told me to play it by ear. And this is where it turned out she wanted to come. Have you got through to the right people yet? No, not yet. But hey, everything's in the works, huh? Couple of more days, we'll be home free. Charlie, Cindy is still scared of you. Now, if these people are around here, it might make her want to split. Hoss, you can handle her. I saw how she was hanging onto you up there. Everything's turning out fine, just fine, huh? Not quite, Charlie. Remember that thing I told you about out there that you said was a scavenger? Yeah. Well, it was here again last night. Sure it wasn't that damn hit man? Not unless he likes to rummage through garbage cans. Cindy saw it clearly through the window, and she said that it was a black woman that looked mentally deranged. (Charlie laughing) Takes one to know one, huh? It's not funny, Charlie. It's very possible that that might be Daphne Wood, the one you had the trouble with. [Charlie] Yeah, so what? (dramatic music) [Steve] Well, she came back here to kill you. Jesus Christ. You really think so, Steve? I think you'd better get the hell out of here so I can go out and find her and get her back to Camarillo. No, uh-uh. Hell no. I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're gonna have some breakfast and then we're gonna get out after her. Damn it, Steve. Just one thing after another. First this Cindy broad, and now this. Now, I don't think she's gonna be dangerous. Okay, you guys ready to go, huh? Charlie, what are you doin' with that? Hey, we're goin' hunting, ain't we? I don't go huntin' without no gun. We're going to find her, not kill her. Hey, look, hoss, if that's who we think it is, she might be up here to kill me, huh? Okay, but just use the gun to scare her. Yeah, sure, hoss. Tell you what, we'll cover more ground if we split up, huh? You and Herbie look up behind the lodge in the hills, Me and Bobo will be down by the lake. Let's go. - Come on, Bobo. - Okay. You coming? [Bobo] Yeah, I'm coming, Charlie. (dramatic music) Steve! Oh God. Ah! I'm gonna be sick. (dramatic music) You okay? Who's that? I don't know. Whatever we're looking for is dangerous, so we'd better go warn Charlie. We'll call the police later. Come on. Can you make it? Uh-huh. Okay. (dramatic music) Hey. Look at that dog. Eh. It's a worthless mutt. Ain't no good to nobody, huh? Hey, Charlie, man, don't! It's only a dog. Get away from me. Charlie, man, it's a, that's a dog! (gun firing) (dog whining) No! (laughing) Here. You hold that while I throw its carcass in the water, huh? It was just a harmless little dog, Charlie? And you didn't have to kill it! If hadn't of shot it, it'd just, uh, run around and breed with a bunch of other dogs, and there'd be thousands more of them, just like you thick headed spics, huh? (laughing) (dramatic ominous music) (knife thudding) Bobo! Shoot her! I can't move! Bobo! Look out, Bobo, please! Shoot her! My god, no! (knife thudding) (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (knife thudding) Ah! (woman grunting and whimpering) God in heaven, Bobo, why didn't you shoot her? (sobbing) I don't know. I couldn't do it. I just couldn't. (sobbing) (screaming) (soft dramatic music) [Cindy] I don't know when I'm gonna hit the road again, you know. I've been there before. I mean, you found me there. I've got places to go and things to see. But Steve, I really do like you. And I think that this might be great now that all this is over. [Steve] Hey, kiddo, nothing in this life is forever. The only thing certain is change. I can't promise anything. But I don't see why we can't give it a try. (soft dramatic music)
