Welcome to Shark School where the cutest fish in the sea go to learn and have fun. Here come Bella and her best buddy Milo riding the waves, swimming to class. They can't wait for their lesson today because to be a smart little fish is the best. Bella and Milo rush to see Professor Fins, the best teacher in the reef, she knows everything and more about the world we live in. Good bubbles Professor Fins. Happy waves Professor Fins. They love their teacher and can't wait to get learning. They know the days fun is just beginning. Bella, Milo so nice to see you today. Did you come to Shark School to learn and to play? You bet Professor Fins. We're here to find out facts and have fun. I hope my brain gets filled with anything I can learn. Me too. Shark School is the best school in the world, I would never miss a day. We waited all night and then almost waited all day to come to Shark School and learn away. Yes, we love to listen to our teacher and learn about everything in the ocean and in the world. That's the spirit little ones. To learn is the best. I'm gonna help you with any questions you have. Get ready for Shark School. You'll have a great time. Bubbletastic Professor Fins, can't wait to get started. My fish brain is ready to learn. What is the lesson about today Professor Fins? The lesson today is about the ocean. I love the ocean, it's our home. Alright, let's not waste time. Let's get ready to know! Shark School is in session. Here we go! Bubbles! Bubbles! Lobsters can be spiny with antennas or have sharp claws to eat dinner. Lobsters have a hard shell called an exoskeleton, it protects them. Lobsters shed their shells to grow called molting, this leaves them weak and vulnerable. Lobsters have 10 legs like crabs and shrimps, their relatives. Lobsters use their claws to eat, they catch and slice fish meat. Lobsters curl and uncurl their fan like tails. They also swim back and forth to escape fast. Lobsters have a great sense of smell, when food crawls close by they can tell. Lobsters eat both plants and meat, on worms, algae and fish they feed. Lobsters can live really long lives avoiding a fisherman's net, they can survive. Lobster eggs are called roe mama's carry them around in tow. There are lots of different lobster species all over the world they live in the sea. Lobsters feed at the bottom of the sea, there they find clams and snails to eat. Lobster claws are also called pincers, one is to crush, the other to mince. Wow, who knew lobsters were so cool, what personalities! And what pizazz. I bet somebody could even keep a pet lobster if they wanted to. Actually there have been pet lobsters Bella. Can you walk them on a leash? Can you teach them to fetch? Well, there was once a writer who was famous for having a pet lobster. The poet, GÃ©rard de Nerval, he loved his pet lobster and even took it on walks using a long blue ribbon as a leash. I bet it could fetch too. Maybe it did. What other interesting animals is the ocean full of? Oh there are plenty Bella. Where would you like to start? Let's start with something smart that has a big brain, somebody who could come to Shark School with us Professor Fins. Alrighty then, it seems only fair to start with the octopus! An octopus? You mean that wild looking thing with all the long arms? That's the one Milo. Pay attention you two you're about to find out what the octopus and it's eight tentacles is all about. Octopuses are sea animals, they live in oceans and tropical waters. Octopus like to eat lobster and other fish meat, crabs and shrimp are some favorite treats. Octopus can squeeze into tight spaces, they have no skeleton and big round faces. Rows of suction sensors line an octopuses limbs, they stick them in rock cracks to find food within. Octopuses have a great escape, they squirt a dark liquid around an attackers face. Some octopus crawl on the ocean floor hunting for crabs and shrimp and more. Octopuses are magicians of the sea, they escape attackers by squirting liquid that is inky. Octopus change color on their skin to that of plants and rocks so they blend in. Like parrots, octopus have beaks, they use it to crack open crabs and shellfish. Octopuses have globed shaped heads, bulging eyes and eight long tentacles. Some octopus arms have suction cups, it helps them pick seafood up. If an octopus loses an arm it will grow back, it will do him no harm. Octopus drop down on their prey, long limbs pull it in their mouths and they munch away. Octopuses have eight long limbs called tentacles, these arms are flexible and thin. A thick, dark fluid clouds the water to confuse, the octopus escapes, attackers give up and lose. An octopus uses his powerful arms when he lifts rocks to build a safe, cozy sea den. Whoa, octopi really are smart. And so are you Milo, for using another plural term for the animal. Whacha mean by that professor? I mean one octopus is an octopus and while it's perfectly okay to call several octopus octopuses, they can also be called octopi. Eight octopi each with eight long tentacles. Will they get all tangled up? That's a tentacled twister of a riddle Milo. I want to learn about a pretty fish next Professor Fins. The most famous clown fish you probably know is the star of the Disney movie, Finding Nemo. Clown fish and sea anemones live together and thrive, they help each other so both can survive. Sea anemones are plant like animals, they protect clown fish with stinging tentacles. Sea anemones live on coral or rocks, clown fish homes are around and about. All clown fish are born males, the strongest of the bunch then turn female. Clown fish, also known as anemone fish, live in warm ocean waters like in the Pacific. Clown fish defend areas around their home, they even attack divers who swim near anemones. Clown fish are small and eat plants or meat on algae and plankton and anemone leftovers they feed. Most clown fish have orange and black bodies with stripes, their vertical stripes are a very bright white. Clown fish live in groups called schools, these little fish are pretty cool. Orange stripes, white stripes? Is the clown fish an orange fish with white stripes? Or a white fish with orange stripes? Show us more cool fish from the ocean professor. Ones that swim far and fast, they can navigate tangley seaweed and coral mazes with ease! Oh please, oh please! Okay Milo, okay. There's no need to beg. Lots of fishes do fun things when they're not laying eggs. Let's meet some of them. Whoa ho, let's do it! Yeah! Puffer fish are gentle and swim kinda slow, when threatened their bodies puff up three times more. Puffer fish transform from thin to round and fat, some have sharp spines imagine that. Puffer fish are known by other names blow fish and balloon fish are one and the same. Puffer fish can grown to a very long size, some can get as big as a shark or baby crocodile. Puffer fish fill their stomachs with air, bloat and all, they fill up and turn into big round balls. A puffer fish skin releases toxins it can be deadly to anyone that touches him. Puffer fish can look at two things at one time, their unique eyesight helps them see predators fine. Puffer fish can change the color of their skin, they can match plants and rocks so they blend in. Puffer fish have teeth, it helps them eat shellfish. How was that my dear pupils? Was that fish enough fun? Did you hear all you wanted to hear? Or shall we meet another one? Let's meet another. Yeah, we could meet fish all day and play and flip and float and flounder til we up and swim away. Lion fish have a whole lot of names, dragon, tiger, zebra, or a turkey fish are one and the same. Lion fish bodies have beautiful stripes, some colors are red, orange, black and white. Lion fish live near coral reefs, in rock cracks they hide and feed. Lion fish have poisonous spines on their back, they use them if an enemy attacks. Lion fish are beautiful but do not pet them, the spines on their back contain powerful venom. Lion fish like to eat meat, fish and shrimp is in their diet. Lion fish hunt both night and day, they catch lots of fish by surprise that way. Lion fish eat so many different fish they are causing problems in the reef. Wow professor what a character that lion fish can be. What other cool animals lurk in the sea? Well I could talk fish with fins and gills all day but let's turn our attention to those that are found in the bay like these long legged little fellas. Who's that walking sideways? It is a crab with 10 legs. Not all crabs walk the same way, come crawl forwards and backwards, some sideways. Some crabs swim with their hindlegs, a hard shell protects their head. Crabs are called crustaceans, arthropods with external skeletons. Crabs legs can bend, they use their front claws for defense. Crab claws are also called pincers, they use them to crush food like mincers. Crabs use their claws to rip their food, they use them as scissors to cut it up good. If a crab loses a claw or a leg in a fight, it eventually grows back in the same site. Crabs have eye stalks set up high, their eyes see all around and up to the sky. Crabs eat both plants and meat, some crabs can climb trees. A group of crabs is called a cast, they work together to find food fast. Some crabs eat off the sea floor, they like worms, snails, clams and more. Crabs use their claws like we use a fork, they rip their foods then bring it to their mouth. The coconut crab is really big, he lives on ocean islands near the Pacific. Crab bodies are flexible and flat, they can squeeze through narrow rock gaps. Their eyes set high, crabs can see what is hiding beneath rocks, coral mud and debris. Have you ever eaten a small pea? The pea crab is that tiny. Crabs talk to each other in many ways, when they flap or drum their claws what do they say? Good golly those crabs remind me of underwater spiders. That's right and there are so many of them, they're absolutely everywhere all over the seabed. That's right you two, they are. And here is another animal that's in no short supply. Some shrimp are barely big enough to see, tiger shrimps are big as lobsters comparatively. Shrimps are small shellfish, to lots of predators they are a tasty dish. Some shrimp make a lot of noise, they snap pincers together, their large and small claws. Lots of sea animals love to eat shrimp, people also think shrimp is delicious. Shrimps have a long body with a shell, a whole lot of legs and antenna. There are thousands of different shrimp species, some live in fresh water, others in the deep sea. Shrimp eat tiny plants, fish and more, they find meals in the water or on the ocean floor. Shrimp live together in schools, they move fast and can even swim backwards too. Some shrimp clean other fish, eating organisms off them they get a tasty dish. Wow shrimps kind of remind me of lobsters. Lots of animals share traits in the sea Milo. If you look long enough you'll see similarities in many of them. Let's keep learning professor, by golly let's keep learning. Get a hold of yourself Milo, you're going into a frenzy. Frenzy? That's for sharks I don't wanna get caught up in that crowd. Here is another fish that likes a crowd. Koi fish are a kind of carp, their bodies are like colorful fish art. Koi fish live in fresh water ponds, people love to watch them swim around. Koi fish are pretty big, some look like giant goldfish. Koi fish can be white or black, their red, orange or yellow with spots on their back. Koi fish eat plants and meat, they like fish eggs, watermelon even peas. Some koi fish owners actually can get koi fish to eat out of their hands. Koi fish need shade or shadow overhead or they can get sunburned on their heads. So many koi colors, some dark, some light, with lots of different patterns and scale types. Koi are originally from China or Japan, friendly fish some will eat out of your hands. These garden fish are hardy and decorative, for hundreds of years they can live. Some people love to own koi, they believe these fish bring luck and joy. Koi are cute and such colorful fish. I'd have a koi pond all to myself if I had my wish. Not me, to much ruckus, I need room to swim. What about play Milo? You like to play? Yes I do. Dolphins are fun and really smart. One of the friendliest marine animals on earth. Dolphins are marine mammals, they are friendly, playful animals. Some people relate dolphins to dogs, both are friendly and like to play with balls. Dolphins do not drink from the sea, eating fish they get all the water they need. Dolphins have teeth but do not chew, they catch, gulp, swallow the whole food. Females dolphins are called cows, really? Males are called bulls, babies calves that is funny. Dolphins live in pods of about a dozen, jumping out of the water you see them coming. To swim dolphins move their tails up and down, they love to surf waves, play and fool around. Dolphins must come up to the surface to breath, through blowholes on their heads, this is achieved. Dolphins eat herring and cod and squid, they also eat mackerel and other fish. Killer whales or orcas are in the dolphin family, but they are a lot bigger and fierce and mighty. Killer whales eat birds, octopus and lots of fish, sharks and sea lions are also a tasty dish. Dolphins must come up for air to breathe, they jump out of the water, happy and free. It is fun to watch dolphins jump and play, they click and whistle when they have something to say. Dolphins have great hearing and eyesight, they are friendly to divers and do not bite. Dolphins are cool and smart don't you know. If any fish swim fast like them I'd sure like to know. We're covering them all Milo, one by one. When it's over you'll know every sea creature under the sun. Really? That's great, tell me more, tell me more professor, I just can't stand it. Ah, we might need to give Milo a chance to chill out professor, I've never seen him like this. It's not unusual Bella, the rush of knowledge can sometimes drive a fish over the edge. Especially one as young and impressionable as Milo here. We'll slow down, let him recover and while we wait Bella I'll show you another. Oh goodie! Who is that swimming in the deep blue sea? It is the beluga whale looking at me. What swims backwards in the sea? A beluga whale happy and free. Beluga whales live in groups called pods, they're flexible neck bobs and nods. Beluga whales are kind of small. Clicks, clangs and whistles hear them call. Belugas have large mouths that open wide to scoop crabs, shrimp and sea worms inside. On mama's back baby belugas ride. As they grow they swim by her side. Beluga heads are shaped like a big ball. For whales, they are known to be quite small. Born gray or brown, they later turn white. Seeing beluga whales is a beautiful sight. Blubber is what they call whale fat. Blubber keeps whales warm like a coat or a hat. Beluga whales have flexible necks, they nod like they are saying yes. Beluga whales swim through the ocean fast. Look now, I see one racing past. Beluga whales skin is covered with hair. They need to swim to the surface for air. Wow, the belugas one wild ocean whale. Are there any other whales who can tell such a tale? Whales are amazing Bella. The belugas just the start. They're all tremendous creatures with brains, strength and heart. Whales do not have lungs like us, instead they breath air through blowholes on the top of their head. Blue whales are the largest animal on earth. But to find one in the ocean you have to search. Blue whales are so huge yet they eat tiny animals called krill for food. Blue whales travel through the ocean vast searching for places where lots of krill swim past. Blue whale sounds are the loudest of all, for miles underwater you can hear them call. Blue whales do not sleep completely. They must swim to the surface and breath deeply. Blue whales swim through the open sea. These huge animals need lots of space to be free. Blue whales eat krill in a strange way, they open their mouths and trap their prey. Blue whales love to sing. They look bluer when they are diving. Blue whales do not have teeth. They swim when they sleep. Blue whale fat is called blubber. They eat lots of krill for supper. They used to be hunted for blubber and oil. In some places that is not legal anymore. Whales do not lay eggs like fish, like us, they give birth to children. Whales are marine mammals. They are very smart animals. Blue whales talk to each other in song. They chirp, squeak and slap their tales all day long. They filter food through plates called baleen. Made of keratin, that is a protein. Water swallowed with krill is released. Krill trapped in it's mouth is gulped down, delicious. You're right professor I love these great whales, such colors and sounds and fins and tails. Yeah show us more professor, I promise I'll stay calm. I'll be quiet as a jellyfish and not explosive as a sea bomb. Alright then, let's keep learning. Let's go. Killer whales are called orcas too. Imagine this huge mammal swimming towards you. Orcas are called wolves of the sea, they sneak up on prey and attack them with glee. Each day orcas eat 500 pounds. They'll eat any sea animal that can be found. Orcas like to slap their tails, they make a big splash even for a whale. Orcas live and hunt in pods. They have really gigantic bods. Orcas have lots of big sharp teeth to tear and rip apart fish meat. A group of orcas is called a pack, watch out when a bunch of them feels like a snack. Orcas can swallow sea lions whole. They catch them sleeping on big ice floes. If orcas leap from water in an ocean dance the ice it lands on does not stand a chance. Orcas eat walruses and seals for food. Sea turtles and squid, they swallow them too. Orcas backs are black, their stomachs white, their ginormous bodies are quite a sight. Orcas are whales and have a dorsal fin. They jump out of the water in a big splashy spin. Wow the killer whale, black and white like a panda, but big as a whale. And so loyal too, they love their family just like people do. That's right kids, whales are the ambassadors of the sea. Ambassadors? What does that mean professor? I'm glad you asked Milo. An ambassador is someone who acts as a promoter or a representative of an activity. Oh like a boss. No, not exactly Milo. An ambassador is just a front person, not the person in charge. So an ambassador is like the face of an activity? More or less, yes Bella. And when a lot of folks think about the ocean and all the wonderful sea creatures in it they often think of whales. Wow that's a pretty cool animal to be the first thing someone thinks of when they think of all the animals swimming in the sea. Yeah. Well many ocean animals that are popular but there are some that are just fins above the rest. And whales are one of those. Tell us more about ocean animals professor. We don't want this class to ever end. He's right professor, we don't. I'm afraid that would be one long class kids, I'd probably definitely lose my voice. Oh no, we don't want that. Whatever would we do with out you fun and informative teachings professor? Yeah, we'd be lost, we'd be bummed, we'd be like bumps on a coral. We mentioned jellyfish earlier professor, can you tell us more about them? I sure can Bella, get yourselves ready for some jellyfish. Jellyfish are mostly made of water. They do not have blood or brains like they oughta. Jellyfish are made of water, like the sea. No brains or blood, hard to believe. Jellyfish are not fish at all. Some look like umbrellas. Jellyfish live in the ocean blue. Some you can see right through. Some jellyfish are big, some are small. Some are so tiny you cannot see them at all. Jellyfish have long tentacles or limbs. If you touch them it can hurt and sting. Jellyfish use their tentacles to hunt for food. They gather in large groups called blooms. Jellyfish eat plankton and tiny fish. Their tentacles sweep food in their mouths with a swish. Jellyfish are creatures of the sea. Do not touch them they can sting. Sometimes called jellies these strange creatures fascinate people with their strange features. Jellyfish bodies pulse up and down that is how they swim around. Saucer jellyfish are sometimes called moons. There's are commonly found in aquarium zoos. Whoa, jellyfish are like ghosts of the sea. They really are, they even look like they're wearing sheets. They're all like wooooooo. Ooh. Some of them look like ghosts, some look like ballerinas. Some look like space saucers. What about those that glow? And those that flow? Some of them even look like bells. And some look like shower caps. Wish I could ride one through the waves. We'll make a jellyfish friend and go for a swim. Eels look like snakes but they are fish. They find worms, shrimp, and snails a tasty dish. Moray eels are long skinny fish. They hide behind rocks and grab food with a swish. Eels have gills and sharp teeth. There are hundred of different eel species. Some eels have a dorsal fin. It helps them balance and to swim. Some eels bodies are smooth. In a wave like motion they swim and move. Sneaky moray eels do not chase their prey, they hide, grab and eat what ever swims their way. Eels can live in so many places, coral reefs, deep seas, rivers, and small rock spaces. There are many foods eels like to eat, on worms, snails, frogs, and shrimp they feed. Congers and morays are some common eels. Snails and worms are some of their favorite meals. Some eels eat octopus and squid. They can be very aggressive. Some eels have bright patterned bodies. Others are simple black or gray colors. Some eels live way down in the sea, in mud or sand on the ocean floor deep. Some eels live in fresh water ponds in rivers and lakes they can also be found. Eels, they're a fish but they look like jumping ropes. Or snakes that can swim. They hide in the rocks. And can surprise you out of nowhere like boom. They sure can, I don't like surprises. And those eyes they're always staring, what are they looking at? Actually most eels can't see very well Bella so when you think they're staring you down they're probably just trying to see you better to figure out what you are. And to figure out if you're a meal. Yikes. Manta ray bodies are big and flat. Their shape helps them swim fast like that. Manta rays eat lots of plankton. Plankton is super tiny organisms. Manta rays do not have bones. Their skeleton is made up of cartilage. Manta rays do not have stingers for defense. Friendly divers like to swim with them. Mantas jump out of the water to play. Maybe they wash off their skin that way. Mantas jump out of the water some days. Scientists why they behave that way. Manta rays have fins like wings. Some have beautiful spots and coloring. Mantas have large mouths to swallow food and long tails, through the water they gracefully move. Some mantas have a big wing span. Helps them swim as fast as they can. Manta rays like to live in warm water. If it gets to cold they cannot put on a sweater. Manta rays have markings on their skin. These unique belly patterns are like finger prints. Mantas are beautiful, so graceful. Yup, I love the way they glide through the wave. Like airplanes of the water instead of the air. That's one way to look at it Bella. Speaking of the air there are some other creatures who don't live underneath the waves. There are? Who is that bird stealing my food? It is a seagull, he can be very rude. Seagulls can be rather rude. From people and other birds, they often steal food. Seagulls live all over the world. Even in Antarctica you can find this bird. Some seagulls live by the sea, flying over water, happy and free. Gulls eat fish and other birds egg stash. They even like to eat peoples trash. Seagulls are sea birds, not picky eaters. They will eat what anyone feeds them. Seagulls live in big groups called colonies. Thousands of birds together, that can be noisy. Some seagulls lay their eggs on land, their eggs blend in with pebbles or sand. Some seagulls nest on beaches or on cliffs high up. That's where they build their nests in the shape of cups. Seagulls are often gray or white. They sleep together in flocks at night. Seagulls have webbed feet. Reptiles and frogs, they like to eat. Some seagulls are smart and they have learned, if they make a sound like rain it lures yummy earth worms. Some seagulls have a unique way to catch fish. They use people tossed food to attract a tasty dish. Wow they sure know how to dive. You got that right, they swoop and splash like Olympic divers. Somebody give those birds a metal. I don't think a seagull would know what to do with a gold metal Bella. They might try taking a bite of it I suppose. Ouch, talk about braking your neck. Still other ocean animals spend a good bit of their time out of the water as well kids. I wonder who it will be? Harp seal where there is lots of ice body fat and fur keeps them warn at night. Baby harp seals are born on bergs of ice. Floating in the ocean with their mama is nice. All seals have blubber to keep them warm. Some seals can hold their breath for several hours long. Harp seal mamas know their pups by smell. Their babies have snowy white fur as well. Seals have whiskers, their bodies are sleek. Groups snuggle together when they sleep. Lying on rocks seals soak up sun. When it is hot they jump in the water for fun. Seals can make a lot of noise. Pups have black eyes and white little toe claws. Fur seal pups are white and very cute. They stay together with adults in groups. Seals do not have ears, sea lions do. That is one difference between the two. Seals move on land, up and down. They use their flippers to walk around. Females are cows, males are bulls. It takes a lot of fish for a seal to be full. Whiskers help them find food to eat. Sensing food like that would be sweet. Some seals can hold their breath for hours, longer than a beaver or an otter. Seals can live on land or sea. Wild ones are happy and free. Seals like fish meat. They also like birds to eat. Elephant seals shed their skin, that is called molting. Elephant seals dive really deep. Way down into the sea. Elephant seals have a meat diet of rays and squid, and octopi. Elephant seals like to eat meat. Sometimes penguins are a tasty treat. Elephant seals are earless. They are huge and fearless. Elephant seal roars can be very loud. They also make grunting and snorting sounds. Elephant seals have a trunk like nose that looks like an elephant trunk when they pose. Elephant seals are the largest seals to be found. An adult can weigh hundreds, even thousands of pounds. Elephant seals have a thick layer of blubber or fat to help them stay warm when it is freezing out. Two kinds of elephant seals, northern and southern. Northern ones live in California, the other one doesn't. Southern elephant seals live in the Antarctic, of all the elephant seals these are the largest. Elephant seals are massive. They have long nails and webbed hind flippers. Put your fins together for the amazing seals. Seals are so funny, they bark like dogs. Yeah they do. If you kids got a kick out of that you oughta check out the next animal. Will it be a fish? Will it be a bird? What will it be? Sea otters like to float on their backs, then they flip over and swim away fast. Sea otters have nice thick fur that keeps them warm in cold water. Otters live in river and seas. They hunt for clams and other fish meals. Otters have webbed feet, they can dive very deep. Giant otters live in South America. They sometimes eat snakes for dinner. River otters hunt to eat. They have webbed feet. River otters are great swimmers. They like to eat frogs and snails for dinner. River otters love to swim and play. They summersault and flip through water all day. River otters love to chase and catch fish. They carry it on land and enjoy a nice dish. River otters are fun to watch travel on land. They run and slide on their bellies as only otters can. Otters have whiskers and are very clean. They wash themselves after every meal. Sea otters like to keep their thick fur clean. They groom by using paws and teeth. Sea otters are marine mammals. They are playful, active, furry animals. Otters like to hunt and eat fish meat. Frogs and crabs are also food treats. Wow, otters are even funnier than seals. They sure are. We oughta team up and do a comedy show together. Milo and otters, one night only. Can I join too? You sure can. Milo, Bella and otters, this Friday at the ocean floor. You two would be great comedians. You think professor? We'll pack in audiences like sardines. We'll fill arenas from sea to shining sea. An audience full of our next animal would be as quiet as the deep sea. Oh yeah? Let me at 'em professor, I've never met a viewer I couldn't make laugh. Green sea turtles are really big. They have a tough shell called a carapace. Green sea turtles like plants to eat, sea grass and seaweed are yummy feasts. Green sea turtles love to swim under the sea. They surface to breath when it is necessary. Sea turtles are reptiles, aquatic animals in different shapes and sizes. Sea turtles cannot hide their heads in their shells to predators this makes them more vulnerable. Leather back sea turtles weigh a thousand pounds, little ones called ridleys, are only a few feet long. Sea turtles have a patterned hard shell that protects them from predators really well. Some sea turtles eat crabs and jellyfish others think plants are a tastier dish. Some sea turtles lay their eggs on land, they bury them in holes in the sand. Sea turtles are great swimmers, they paddle fast using powerful flippers. Sea turtles do not have teeth, they use powerful jaws to munch and eat. Well, they sure were quiet. Quiet and calm, just flowing with the waves. Are you rethinking your comedy plans yet Milo? Ah, maybe I'll book my shows where the turtles don't live. I think those seals are more my crowd. Mmhmm, we thought you'd say that. Well, let me know when your first show is guys and I'll be sure to attend. And clap like seals. I want to make you laugh more than anybody Professor Fins. Me too. You already make me smile and laugh all the time kids. Alright! Our time is up for today kids. You can make me smile more tomorrow. See you next class, where we'll continue our look into the ocean! Woohoo! I can't wait, see you next time Professor Fins. Milo and Bella swim home their brain full of facts and fun stuff they've learned. Tomorrow will be another day in Shark School to learn and to play. Until tomorrow everybody!
