No shit, it's gone. What did you do with it? I threw it away. Aw... For Christ's sakes, Joe, I thought you were dead. So, that's it? You just toss everything away? My whole life? Joe, it was trash. I couldn't have given that shit away if I tried. Listen. Look, look, look. I got a place opening up. South side, end of February... Frankly, I don't know if you can afford it, but... South side?

You need a place to stay, and... I could use a little help with the rent. You get where I'm going with this? What about your kid?What about her? Well, where's she gonna sleep? With me. Look... There's a good chance that I'm not gonna be needing this place much longer. I'm kind of waiting on something. If it works out. 100 a week sound fair? Do you mind? Don't you have someplace you have to be? School or something? How about spreading out a little bit? Give me some elbow room there, would ya? I'm sorry, kid, it's just that I've been having a pretty shitty time of it lately. Me too. Well, what do you know, she speaks! How very nice. You had a shitty day, huh? What'd someone do, pull your pigtails at school? No. Your ice cream fall on the ground? Well, whatever it is, that's life, kid. One day you're on top of the world, and the next day you're floating in the crapper. The sooner you learn that, the better off you're gonna be. Piece of shit. Hey, come here for a minute. Come on. Get up on that crate. You see that guy over there? Yeah. Yeah. The guy with the pole? Fucker stole my pigeons. Why don't you call the cops? Well, it ain't like that. All I gotta do is fix up this coop, make a nice home for them, some food, water, clean hay to lay on, and they'll come back. They always come back. All you gotta do is make it nice for them. Stan's a cop. Who's Stan? Mommy's boyfriend. Oh, your mother's got a boyfriend! And you like this guy... What's his name? Stan. This guy, Stan, do you like him? No, huh? Well...

Are you gonna help me or what? Shit. All right. Stop. Stop it. Stop. I, uh... You called a car? When we get there, I want you to pull up right in front of this joint like we own it, okay? Now, how much to open the door for me when I get out? Ten bucks. All right, but you do it again when I get back in, you understand? No problem. All right. And no chit-chatting with those other drivers while I'm inside. We're here on business. Joe May! I thought you were dead! What do you say, Georgie-boy? How the hell you been? I'm good, you? Eh, okay, uh... I heard you were sick or something. Nah, nah, nah, I'm fine. Listen, uh... Lenny inside? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on inside. Yeah, I'll check you out later, huh? Yeah. Morning, Len.

So talk. Do you mind? Oh, I'm sorry. So, how's your father? Fine. Would you tell him that I said hey? What do you want, Joe? Well, you know me, Lenny. I'm never one to beat around the bush. So don't. You see, well, the thing is... I need a little bump, you know what I mean? Nothing big, nothing grand, you know, just something that I can get my hands on. How long you been running short of money, Joe? My whole life. And how much money you got in the bank, huh? A grand? Two grand? How much? Oh, no, you got it wrong. Look, you see, I'm not here looking for a handout. Well, then what are you doing here? Go home, retire, go to fucking Florida. Florida? That shit's not for me. You see, Lenny, I think I still have something to offer. Really, I mean it. Now, your old man, he would've... Oh, come on, Joe. We were kids together. Okay, enough. Enough. You got a pen? Yeah. Yeah! Here you go. Ask for Seymour. Right? He'll set you up. Okay. Okay, Seymour. Great, okay. What about us? The usual. 20%. You're a prince, Lenny, really, a prince. Thanks. Hey, Joe, where you going? I'll see you later, Georgie, okay? May I help you? Billy Tidrow in there? Billy! Billy! Oh! Jesus Christ. Come on, let's go have a drink. Eh, it's kind of early. Well, we have coffee, then. I'm kind of in the middle of something. Come on, I'll be out front. Come on. Hey, Joe. What are you doing? What do you mean? Where's your coat? I got a game going upstairs. A game? Yeah. What you got going on? Come on, let me in. What do you got? No scams, Joe. I'm retired, man, for real. Are you kidding me? Give me one of those, you prick. So, how you been? Well, I tell you the truth, Billy, I've been better, but things are looking up, and that is exactly why I'm here talking to you. Joe! No, come on, just... Hear... Hear me out, okay? Please. You still got your car, right? I sold it. Anyways, I don't want no part of no short money schemes. What is the matter with you? Come on. We'll go out, make a few bucks, have a couple of laughs. We'll get our hands on some Fugazi watches. Listen, I was just over at Lenny's place. Take a look at this. Chiappetti. What the fuck's Chiappetti? Come on, Joe. Eh, come inside. Meet some of the guys. You'll be surprised. What the hell happened to you? I go away for a couple of months, and all of a sudden you're Mr. Fucking High Pants? We're not kids anymore, Joe. Come on! Nah, just not for me. Yeah, right. Still waiting for your big break, your great destiny. We did all right together. Yeah, so what's so wrong about sitting back and relaxing a little? Huh? Come on! Come on inside. Nah. It's not for me, Billy. See you around. Now, you see that one there? That's Mimi, and the one next to her, that's Rodolfo. How can you tell? Well, Mimi has got that little spot on her beak, and Rodolfo, well, he shacked up with Mimi. So, in a few days, Mimi is gonna lay a couple eggs, and then her and Rodolfo will take turns sitting on them. Pigeons are funny that way. Hey, Joe? Yeah. Stan's not my father, you know. No shit. I've never seen my real father. Well, don't sweat it. I didn't know my old man, either. Didn't hurt me none. Ready? Yeah. Here. You can do it. Two days? Two fucking days? For the love of Christ! Listen to me. I want you to go back on the roof and stay in the coop, you hear? But... No, no, listen to me. Go ahead. Quick. Hurry now. Pick it up! A dozen fucking roses. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. What the hell's going on? Twenty-five bucks down the fucking drain. Hey, look, you know what? I think you'd better go before I call the cops. The cops? The cops? I am the cops, you fucking idiot. Let me give you a little advice, old man. Don't go sticking your fucking nose where it don't belong. I'll see you around, gramps. Jack-off. So, how long has this crap been going on? Look, it's not what you think. He's a good man. He's just a little bit stressed out right now. Did you see his eye? You know how that happened? Running into a fire to save a lady and her kid. How many people do you know who would do something like that? It's not easy, me having a kid and all. He puts up with a lot. He asked me, uh, to go away with him for the weekend. Just me and him. I want to go. I need someone to watch Angelina. No. No, sirree. No way, baby. No. Just this once. No. No, no. Look. Look. I like your kid. She's a sweet kid. I really like her, but, uh, me and kids, we, uh... We don't get along. We never mix. We never did. Oh, just this once. I would love to help you out, I really would, it's just that, you know, I just don't do things like that. It's not my nature. I need to do this. It's a little tight. Better? Joe? Yeah? Would you get me a glass of water? Water, huh? Better? Good. Will you give me a kiss good night? Why don't you just close your eyes and go to sleep. Please? What the hell is this? I was scared. Of what? Now, kid, let me tell you something. As long as I'm around this joint, nobody's gonna hurt you, you understand that? Now, I may not look like much, but I got a couple of really good moves left in me. You didn't even see it coming, am I right? I'm going to be right down the hall. If you need anything, you holler, okay? Okay. Okay. Thanks. Hey, Joe? Yeah. Can I ask you something? Sure, go ahead. How come you were crying last night? What are you talking about? I never cried in my life, okay? But I saw you last night. Did anyone ever tell you that it's not very nice for little girls to go around spying on people? Sorry. You ought to be. Besides, I wasn't crying. Not like you think crying is. It's just that sometimes... You know, something is so beautiful, a song or whatever, and it... It's so beautiful that it makes you start thinking about stuff. About what? I don't know. Life, I guess. How things might've been. Are we gonna have breakfast together tomorrow? I'm not sure. And the day after that? Yeah, why? Just asking. You just gotta stay here a little while is all. But I don't want to stay here. I want to go with you. Well, you can't. Why? Well, you just can't, all right? I got some business I gotta take care of, and there's no little girls allowed. When are you coming back? Later. I'll bring you something nice, I promise. Say good-bye now. Uncle Billy's freezing his nuts off. Okay, you do what Billy tells you to do. Come on, sweetie. What can I do for you? Is Seymour around? I'm Seymour. Lenny says hey. Give you a call back. Move that stuff, guys! Let's go! Here. Put this on. USDA. Have I got something for you! Come on. Come on, guys! Get this stuff going! What's going on here? Watch it. It's real slippery here. All right. Think fast! What the fuck is this? Grass-fed New Zealand lamb, 50-pound shank. Yeah, but what am I supposed to do with it? I don't know, eat it? No. No, look... Look, Lenny told me to hook you up, so I'm hooking you up! Yeah, yeah. What the fuck were you expecting? But not with this, you know, I want some radios or some Fugazi watches, maybe. What the fuck am I supposed to do with... This place look like a fucking watch factory to you? I don't know, but this is a mistake. I'm telling you it's a fucking mistake! No, there's no mistake. No! There's a mistake! What the fuck am I supposed to do with it? Lenny told me to give you something, and I'm giving you something. I don't know what you were thinking, but I run a legitimate business here. Now, if you want the meat, I suggest you take it and get the fuck outta here! I'll take it. I'll take it, you scheming fucking rat. Fucker. Yo! Hey, pop the trunk, would ya? What the fuck is that? Will you just please pop the trunk? Oh, fuck no! Rotten cocksucker! I pray God you hit a lamppost, you fucking hump! Goddamn it. Hey! Fuck you! Deal 'em up, big guy. Looking a little bare over there, Bob. Yeah. Bonjour, everybody. How do you like my moustache? Oh, very nice. Very nice. So, you have a sandwich here! Yeah, I do, and I'm gonna eat it! Maybe you can share this beautiful sandwich. I need two cards, mister. Uno, dos. Thank you. I have to pee. What? I have to pee. Well, it's right down the hall there, sweetie. Who dealt this mess? Hello. Yo. Excuse me. I'd like to see the manager, please. Hi. Oh, the proprietor, just the man I wanted to see. What is this? This, sir, is grass-fed, grade-A, New Zealand... All right, you need to get out of my store. If you could just hear me out for one second. You're dripping blood all over my counter! This is such tender New Zealand lamb, sir, that you can actually cut it with a fork. I want you to get the fuck out of my store! Do you hear this? So tender that you can cut it with a knife! Hey! I don't want to hear it, buddy! What the hell do you think you're doing? Take it easy! You're gonna get me shut down! What, are you a communist?Get the hell outta my store. Fucking lunatic! I mean it, you come back here, I'm calling the cops! Give me my fucking meat! Holy shit! Choke on it, you mangy motherfucker. Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened to you? Just send the kid out, all right? Yeah, we've got a problem. Kid took off. What do you mean she took off? She's seven years old. I don't know. Shit, she snuck out or something. I called the cops. The cops? No, no, Billy, no cops, come on! What the fuck is wrong with you? I asked you for one favor. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen to me. Call the coppers. Tell them that she came back, and if she shows up here, just call me at home. Give me that coat.Yeah, yeah. Give me that fucking coat. Where are you going? Hello? Anybody home? Hello? Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello. Hey, Joe. It's Jenny. Yeah, hi. How's everything going? I'm, um... I'm going to be coming home a little earlier than I said. Oh, yeah? How long? A couple... A couple hours. A couple hours! How's Angelina? No, no, no, she's fine. No, really, we're having a ball. Yeah, no, yeah, it's good. Okay. No, I was just coming up the stairs is all. Okay.Okay. Bye. Bye. You know, you scared the shit out of me. You scared the shit out of me. Here. I'm sorry that I left you at that place with all those old fucks over there. I didn't think you were coming back. But I did. I did come back, right? I'll always come back. Promise? Go ahead, Mom, and ask me all the streets in the loop. But I already know all the streets in the loop, sweetie. Just ask me. What are all the streets in the loop? Clinton fell in the canal... He was whacked, but frankly, I'm doing well, Lasalle. That's great. What happened? What else did I teach you? Ask me all the north/south streets. What are all the north/south streets? Somebody's at the door. Come on. I know you're in there. Baby, open the door. We need to talk. Please. Please, baby, I... I'm sorry! I'm begging you, just open the door so we can talk. Jenny! Please, baby, don't shut me out like this. I need you! Open the fucking door! She finally fell asleep. Don't ask. It's more complicated than you think. He knows things. Things I did when I was younger, even before I had Angelina. Things that I'm not proud of. The one time that I did call the cops... The very next day, child services were knocking on my door. I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. But no one's gonna take my baby from me. I know people, people who'll take that crumb out, no questions asked. Thanks. Um... The landlord called today and said that, uh, he had a place opening up, so I figured it might be a good idea just to clear out. Throw Stan off the scent for a while. And you can have your whole place to yourself again. It'll be good. Mmm. Well, I, uh... I'm kind of beat. I think I'll hit the hay. Joe. I don't want to come off the wrong way, but... Do you think that you could hold me? Just for a minute? I don't think that's such a good idea. Hello? Scotty? Who is this? It's your father. Are you there? Do you have any idea what time it is? Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, but, you know, I just got a wild hair up my ass. I thought I'd give you a call and see... Take care of yourself. I will. Hey, come on. Hey, Joe. Hey, George. Hey, uh, are you all right? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't... You don't look so good. I'm fine, really. Is Lenny inside? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on inside. "...the company's top executive devise "a more aggressive business plan "that will put them on the offensive in North America, "despite the tough downsizing measures" "the company's taking." What's up, Len? You got my money? Well, you see, Len, there's, uh, been a little problem. Seymour didn't hook you up? No, he did. He hooked me up. What's the problem? I couldn't sell it. What are you talking about? He gave you grade-A, grass-fed, New Zealand lamb. Shit sells itself. Yeah, yeah... I know all of that. It's just that, you know, I was wondering maybe if, you know, you couldn't hook me up with something different. Like what? I don't know, you know, like some watches or radios or something like that, you know, I mean, I was always really good at hustling electronics and shit like that, you know? You are a piece of work, Joe. You know that? Look, you got my money or what? I lost the meat. How the fuck do you lose 50 pounds of raw meat? Jesus Christ! Give him a glass of water before he dies on my linoleum. Joe. Joe, here. Drink. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. All right, look, I'll tell you what. Um, Seymour says retail, that piece of lamb is worth almost a grand, which means you're into me for what, two bills, right? I, uh... I don't have that kind of money. What's that? I said I don't have that kind of money. Eh, well, you run along and you find me my money, and then maybe we'll talk about hooking you up with some electronics. Sure thing, man. It's like my old man always said, you want to get rid of a loser, you lend him five bucks and you'll never see him again. Hey, hey, Joe! Where you going? Joe, let me give you a lift! Joe! Hey, hey. Hey, Joe! Hey, man. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Wait, man. Hey. Hey, look. Uh, take this. Take a cab home. You giving me money, Georgie? Aw, come on... Georgie the fucking driver is giving me a handout? Take the money and stick it right in your ass! You're a fucking bum! You never knew who your friends were, you know that? And you never will! Son of a bitch. Did you see what he did? What are you doing here? Would you believe that I just happened to be in the neigh... You want to come in for a second and get warmed up? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Thanks. You got a nice place here. What's that? Aw, it's just a little something I brought for Billy. Dad, Billy is 20 years old. He's going to graduate from college next year. Yeah. You know he thinks you're dead. Look, Scotty, I, uh... I know that you're angry with me... I'm not angry with you, dad. No, you've been angry with me for a long time, and that's why I'm here. I'm here because I want to talk about it, I want to get everything out in the open. Just, you know... There is nothing to talk about. We don't even know each other. I have more in common with a stranger walking down the street. I know I was a lousy father, Scotty. Okay, I know that, but... But what? No, I... No, there's no "but." I want to explain. Just let me explain, okay? You know, I think you should go, okay? No, no. No, no. Please... Yeah, why don't you just... No, no! No? Look, you've got to know something. If I wasn't always there for you, there was a reason for that, okay? I just always thought that... That there was something out there for me. I don't know what. I don't know what it was. It was just I always... I just thought there was something, something waiting for me. Something great. You stupid, selfish, pathetic man. You spent your whole life looking out for nobody but yourself. I mean, just look at you! Stupid fucking coat, your stupid, pathetic shoes. Do you remember the last Christmas? Before Ma died? Do you remember what you got her? No, I don't. Huh? No, I don't remember. The woman was dying, and you got her a cookie jar shaped like a duck. Of course she made such a big deal over it. The way she always did whenever you'd throw her a bone, showing it to all the neighbors. I didn't have the heart to tell her that I found a box of the exact same cookie jars in the trunk of your car the week before. Or that you were trying to unload them all over Grand Avenue for two bucks a pop. Just get out. Just get out of my house. Hey, old man. Where is she? - Go 'round the corner. - Go this way! Joe! Where the fuck did he go? Go this way. Oh... Hello? I told them your number. I remember it, just like you told me. That's right, Angelina, you did the right thing. Where's your mother? Come on. He'll find me. Wherever I go, he'll find me. Everywhere I go. What'll it be? Bourbon with a beer. Rocks? Neat. Make it a double. Be $10.50, please. That is a nice coat, man.Thanks. They don't make 'em like that anymore. No, they sure don't. How much you want for it? Seriously. We're about the same size. I'll give you $50 for it. Coat's not for sale. It's worth a shot, huh? Thank you. Keep it. Excuse me? I said keep it. Dude, there's, like, $40 on the bar. Hey, thanks, man. Are you calling about an emergency? Uh, no, I'd like to talk to the Belmont Avenue detectives, please. Please hold while I connect you. Oh, I'd like to talk to, uh, Detective Stan Buczkowski, please. He's not here. Do you want to leave a message? Yeah. Um... Would you tell him that Joe May called? Oh, wait a minute. You should tell him that the old man called. He won't know who you're talking about if you mention my name. Okay. Would you tell him for me... Tell him that if I ever see his ugly, greasy, dirty, wife-beating face around again, that I'm gonna rip his balls out of his sack and stuff them right down his cocksucking throat. Have you got that? Hello? I'll give him the message. I got it, thanks. Go up here to the light, about three blocks. Hey, old man! Come out, come out, wherever you are! Making me work, old man, and I don't like to work if I don't have to. How'd you like what I did to your pigeons, huh? You like that? Just doing my job. We serve and protect. Yeah. Yeah, no, he's, he's not here. Yeah, I checked the whole place. Just pull around. Yeah, I'll be right down. Oh, Jesus! God! Hey, Joe May's picture's in the paper. He finally die? Yeah, but first he killed a fucking cop. Let me see that. I know this cop. He's a real fucking lowlife. Joe May. Joe May. What time you meeting Roy? In about an hour. Is he coming over here? No, I'm meeting him there.
