Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the beginning... of our journey to the South Pacific islands. Take a look to the ocean side, ladies and gentlemen. You see some of the guys going up the tree. If you like what they're doing, please give them a round of applause. Everybody, let's greet them with a loud "Aloha!" Aloha! Oh, yeah! We have somebody, someone special. Uh-- I'm James. I'm from California. Hello, James! Let's give a round of applause for James from California. California! Ho! Oh, James. Oh, James. James, you are-- Oh, James-- Stop. Stop, James. Stop. Stop. Can I use your microphone? You want my microphone? Uh, I know that this is unexpected. Um-- Uh, but Hawaii is-is magical... like you. Every day with you, uh, Lily, is an adventure. And I don't want that to stop. Um, I love you, so-- Lily Kim-- will you marry me?

Please fasten your seat belts... and make sure your seats and tray tables are in the upright position. We hope you've enjoyed our little island hop from Maui as much as we did. We thought it was short but sweet. On behalf of all of us on the flight crew, we'd like to say mahalo for choosing Hawaiian Airlines. Hey! Lily, hi! Oh, hi, Mom. I thought it was 9:30, and I've been circling and circling. Welcome home. Oh. Here you go. Oh, look at you. You haven't changed much in five years. What the hell did you do to your hair though? I cut it. It looks good. It looks good. Yeah? Good genes-- mine, not your father's. A lot of freckles. They look good though. How was Maui? Um, James had to go back early. Why? It just-- It wasn't working out. What wasn't working out? I don't wanna talk about it. Do you mind driving? I've been here two minutes. My nerves are just a little frayed. Where is she? Hi. Aloha. You're late. No, no. We're not late. The flight was late. Say hello to your sister. Hi. Where's your boyfriend? Uh, she dumped him. I didn't dump him. We got eyes on Cori. We are just not speaking right now. Copy that? What's your 20? She was headed toward the jellyfish. Keep the 20 on Greg. Hi! Oh, hi! Oh, look at you. How are you? Wow. Your hair is so short. I know. Oh, my God. Miss Hapai Hawaii. You're making me look bad. Hi. Hi, little guy. It's another girl. Oh. Hi. Hi, little girl. This is your favorite Auntie Lily. Hi. God, if there's a ... in the room, you're really gonna find it, huh? Lily! What? Language. You know-- Just say "tadpole" or something. Really? So if there's a tadpole in the room, you're gonna find it? You look fabulous. Do you think they're happy? I think so. Don't you? I think maybe they want to be in the ocean. I can't wait to be in the tank. The ocean can be so... big and lonely. But I don't want to be in the tank... with someone who wants to be in the ocean. Oh, my God. Have you seen Cori, the bride? No. Lily? Ah! Lily Wolf. It's actually Lily Kim. I took my father's name after high school. Greg. Are you getting married? Wh-What are you doing here? My sisters are the wedding planners. He's up there waiting for you... while you hide out with the jellies. Maybe you're the one afraid of the tank. I'm not afraid of the tank. I'm not afraid of the tank. I waited my whole life to get into that tank. Nobody's gonna stop me. Okay, let's do this. She just needed to powder her nose. The wedding planners are your sisters? Yeah. Who's this? This is my first kiss, my first heartbreak. This is a bad omen. Why would you invite her here? I didn't know they dated. That's right, because I meant nothing to you. It was the ninth grade. Maybe I should go. No, you stay. I'm going. I knew you were having second thoughts. If I would've listened to my mother, then maybe I wouldn't be in this mess. The wedding's off. Wait. No, Cori, don't go. Remember the tank? Remember the jellyfish? Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait, wait! Marriage is the most magical thing that a couple could ever make! Hey. Hi. Look. Tutu is dancing. Come on, let's go. Say hi to tutu, Numi. Please don't make me sing in front of your family. Come on, Roy. You used to love karaoke. Hi, Miriam. Hey, Mom. I just can't believe you did that to me, James. You put me on the spot. No. No, I'm not gonna apologize. It's the natural next step. James. I told you-- no marriage. I will date you until I am dead. Till death do us part. What we have is perfect. Marriage is the most moronic thing a couple could ever do. Why would you want to do that? Lily, we've had three great years in L.A. I thought you'd gotten over that. What? Get o-- Get over that? What-- What is "get over that"? You don't just "get over that." Clearly, you have no idea who I am or what I value in life. That was the wrong thing to say. You don't just "get over that." There's no contest if you don't know it's a contest. Uh, Kai? Hey. Hi. What are you doing here? Singing. All right, I better get goin', huh? Yeah. Hey, uh-- You wanna go out for coffee sometime? You don't drink coffee. No. But you still like to get dirty? You know what I mean. We can go for a hike. There you are. Hey. Hey, Hoku. You remember each other? Yeah. Well, I'm gonna get goin'. Tomorrow, 10:00? Yeah. What was that? I don't know. "Tomorrow, 10:00"? Oh, we're hiking. Do you really think that's wise, going on a hike with your ex? Um, it's not like we're making out. We are just walking. Auntie Lily! Gina! Hi! Come on. We're waiting for you. Did you get your Halloween costume yet? How are you, stud? I'm livin'. Where's your man? Somewhere over the Pacific. Good. Now you can find yourself a nice local boy. Oh, Lily, your song is up. Oh! This isn't Lily's song. Yeah, it is. I usually sing it. Only when Lily isn't here. Stop acting like a preteen. They never have this song in L.A. Look at those frowns. You're gonna need Botox before you're 25. ♪ I remember days-- What are you going to sing, Roy? I'm not singing. ♪ When we were younger Roy. Wait. - Is he okay? - Bathroom. ♪ Round the Ko'olau hills, we'd ride on horseback ♪ Everybody did a good job. So, what did everybody learn today? Grow local, eat local, be local! All right! I never thought you'd come home. - Oh, I'm not staying. I'm just trying to figure out my next move before I go back to L.A. I never thought you'd still be volunteering here. I don't volunteer here. I teach here. I teach self-sustaining agriculture. That's really impressive. There's nothing you can do? Okay. I understand. Thank you. The landlord won't give us an extension. You know, "to be fair," she's not bending leases for anyone. Okay, thanks. We lost the deposit on the aquarium and the catering. Why are we responsible for the deposit? Technically, we're not. But we fronted the deposit, and then we rolled that plus a whole bunch of other expenses... into Greg and Cori's final bill. Great. We can sue. We'll be evicted by then. Hey. Good morning. Tying the Knot. Hi. Sure. Hold on. Hey, it's Roy. Hey, honey. What, again? What time? Okay. No. Bye. Bye. Everything all right? It's fine. Roy just has to work late tonight. That's the, uh, third time this week? I know. Let's just not start. Don't start. Okay? You know, I'm dating someone now. Great! Um, I mean, that is-- That's great. Well, I wanted to tell you so, you know, you didn't think that-- Oh, no. Oh, my God. No. No. That's not what I meant. No, look. I said "great" like a freak... because clearly I have some problems. And, I don't know, when I saw you that night, you just-- you looked so good and normal. I mean, in a completely nonsexual way. Like, I'm not trying to be weird or anything, but-- Where are you going? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I didn't mean to scare you. Are you okay? I'm fine. - Oh! - Really? Look, I'm fine. Please. Just leave me alone. Tina? Tina Takatori? Hey. Kai Chow. A.P. sciences. Oh. Hey, Kai. I didn't even recognize you. Oh! Hey. Hey, Lily. Hi. Tina Takatori. Wow. You-You guys are still together after all these years. It's so romantic. Okay then. See ya. I don't know. Let's go. Okay. I'm getting married! My wedding is in a month and-- I mean, I-I can't do this by myself. I think that some of the vendors are trying to rip me off, but I don't know because the contracts are so confusing. And then the seating chart is a mess. And then the venue is double booked. And then I hate my dress! Hey, Lily can help you. Her family specializes in love. They-- I mean, making love. No. I mean the-- the weddings. You should hire Lily. Oh. Thanks. I really don't think we should be getting involved with this. It's what you do. No. It's what my family does. It's a great opportunity. Don't let this go. You need this. Come on. Okay. I got it. I'm going. Let's go. Let's go. Listen, James. I don't know what happened. I don't care what happened. But I know two things. It was her fault, and she's sorry. No, she's not sorry. She's pissed at me. She's not pissed at you. Yes, she is. She told me that she was. I'm trying to help you, okay? But you have got to do it my way. I think I blew it. I should've just listened to her. James, you need to get married, okay? And she's not gonna feel better until she gets married. And you're the guy. What about kids? You want to have kids someday. I'm sure your parents aren't going to be happy with illegitimate grandchildren. What do I need to do? No contact. No phone calls, no e-mails-- nothing. But-- Oh, one more thing. Very important. She cannot know that I'm involved, at all. Who is that? The other bride. Apparently the hotel has two booking agents-- one here and one in Japan. But their calendars didn't refresh or something, so they didn't realize that they both booked the ballroom. Oh. So what's the game plan? Me? Oh. Are you okay? Yeah. Um-- Have you spoken to the management? No. Have you written a letter of complaint? No. Well, have you done anything to fight this? I really don't like confrontation. Yeah, but you've gotta stand up for yourself, or you're gonna be reactionary to a situation that you should be controlling. The squeaky wheel gets the grease. Okay. Okay. Come on. Come with me. I'm gonna talk to them. Thanks. What-- I got here as fast as I could. - What-- What did you do? - She got you a new client. Who got me a new client? Lily! Oh! Oh, thank you so much. I have to go tell my mom and Michael. But I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Okay. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I-I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry. I ruined their wedding. How? By being me. No. This is career suicide. She's unstable, hates people, hates weddings. She's unfriendly. She's right here. But the client wants her, Hoku. This girl is really fragile, and she says Lily is her rock. Yeah, but don't I get a vote? I mean, I agree with Hoku, sort of. Look, it just-- It isn't my thing. And I think that my track record speaks for itself. You're staying here for the wedding. This is a family business. You're part of the family. You don't have anything for you in L.A. Discussion is over. Mmm, this is nice. I'd like to propose a toast. Really? To you and your sisters and mother. May you have many more years in Hawaii... as the best wedding planners. Yeah? And to your new clients. Are we all ready to order? Um, are you gonna ask me something else? No. We're gonna need a few more minutes. Are you mad? Why me? What'd I do? Nothing. You did nothing. Then why are you mad? Kai, why'd you bring me here? We never go out to eat anywhere nice. You never wear shoes. Well, you were so stressed out at work, so I thought I'd do something special. We don't have to stay here. We could go someplace else. We could go to Zippy's. I don't want to go to Zippy's. I want you to propose. Maybe another minute. Oh. You're surprised? Why would you want me to propose... if you don't even want to tell your family that we're dating? I don't want them getting in our business. Then why you want to get married? Kai, we've been dating for four months. I need a commitment in the next year in order to arrange the wedding, afford the down payment on the house and have the baby. God, I thought you were thinking about it too. Wow. Okay. Okay? I'll think about it. Okay. So how many more miles do I have? Ew. Yes. Yes, I will hold. What are you doing here so late, huh? I would rather fight it out with James than be forced to do this. Well, you know, the bride from Japan... is willing to push up her date by a couple of weeks. So that's good news, right? I never meant to hurt her. But if you leave, you'll be hurting Tina-- not to mention us. Because I don't wanna play fairy "godsister"? Are you just afraid to work? What is that supposed to mean? Come on. We all know that James is your sugar daddy. What? Mm-hmm. No, he's not. Uh-- I-- He just-- He doesn't need help with the bills, and I live simply. Well, I'd live simply too, Lily, if I didn't have to work and I could go on vacation for a month. You're a workaholic, and that's on you. The business is broke, okay? And Cori's canceled wedding has just pushed us completely over the edge, no thanks to you. So you know what? Fine. Go. I threw up on him. What? James asked me to marry him, and I, um-- Oh, I-- I threw up. All over him and the ring. Oh, Lily. Well, sometimes when the "S" hits the fan, it's best to stay near family. The "S"? Really? Hey, don't flat-tire me. Oh, just zip it. ♪ Across candlelit tables Huh? ♪ Glances ♪ ♪ Quiet dinners Slow dances ♪ Oh, my God. I'm a magnet for losers. ♪ Abandoned plans-- ♪ Well, you know what they say. Always the wedding planner and never the bride. Once, twice, three times a loser. You know? So, what do you do? Pineapples. I'm here for a pineapple convention. Lily. Lily. Are you sleeping? Lily. Wake up. Mom? You're up. Hi. Hi. Oh, God. Have you been drinking? Yes. Mmm. Can I sit next to you? Do I have a choice? Oh. I have it all figured out. You think that James is gonna leave you. Yes. Oh, my God. Go away. You only commit to the chase. And with marriage, there is no chase. I think it's an archaic institution. That archaic institution... got you through four years of college. And Amos and I had three great years. Yeah, until you realized that he was shacking up... with Joanne Becker the home wrecker. Let me tell you something. I loved your father. When we got married-- I thought-- I thought we were gonna live happily ever after. Every time I walked down the aisle, I thought we were gonna live happily ever after, but it didn't happen. You know why? 'Cause I found out you have to work at staying in love. So you can call it whatever you want, Lily, but you have to work at relationships-- even the bad relationships. Sweetie? I just don't want you to grow old... and be alone. Today, we have Miriam Wolf, Lily's mom. So she'll talk to us about her career. She's a wedding planner. It's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. Let's just get up. Let's get up. It's okay. It's all-- Okay. This sucks! Your mom is scary. She's getting divorced. What's that? My mom says it's a curse when adults grow old and die alone. We'll come back to story time in about five minutes. You're scaring the kids. You've gotta get up. Hoku. We're gonna be late. I'm coming. I'm coming. Um. I'm ready. So there's a lot to do, but, uh, we'll just take it slow, okay? There's no reason to rush into things. This is a bad idea. Well, Tina shouldn't need you for a couple of days at least, so that gives us plenty of time. We can just-- Hi, Tina. Hi. Are you ready to have fun? Um, I'm pretty nervous actually. No, no, no. It's gonna be great. This is my favorite part of the wedding. Hoku is a total pro. You're in great hands. Oh, I was hoping that Lily would come with me. Oh. I mean, if that's okay. Uh, of course she can. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You can do this. Try not to throw up on anyone. Thank you for that advice. Ready? Hey. Hey, your family seemed really freaked out to leave us alone. Oh. Bye. No. They just always like to say bye to people. They hate to see people leave the office. They spent a lot of time decorating it. Now, then, what kind of dress are you looking for? What do you mean? The silhouette-- Princess, Empire, Basque Waist, Mermaid. A two-piece? Oh, I have some pictures of a few dresses I like. Okay. Okay, and, um, since this will be my second dress, my budget won't be very much. It's fine. It's gonna be fine. Okay. So, you like? It's okay. I need help. I thought you might. Oh, Mama's here. This is a beauty. I took the liberty of pulling a few dresses... just to see where the fabric lies and... where your heart lies, more importantly. I hope you don't mind. No, I don't mind at all.

I just hope it works. James, the only way to get Lily to realize... that she wants to get married... is to tell her that she cannot be married. This is a little drastic. Drastic times call for desperate measures. I-- I think it's "drastic measures." Details. When will she come home? I gotta go. Blood pressure's a little low. I think it's time for you to start taking it a little easy, huh? If-If babies can hear from the womb, uh, can she read my thoughts? I don't know about that. Yeah, I know. So, who is she? Come on. Why are you so embarrassed? What, is she in high school or something? Oh, no, no. She's not in high school, is she? No, she's young, but she's not that young. Well, then how young is she? Twenty-one. Oh, my God. That's like dating my little sister. What do guys see in younger girls? I mean, does she look at you dotingly... and then just bat her eyes... and think that everything you say is golden and true... 'cause you're old? Don't be jealous. I was just kidding, and I'm not jealous. And traditionally, the ceremony is performed on this part of the lawn... because, as you can see, it has the best view. And then after the ceremony, we will unveil the sake bar right over here. Sake bar? Oh, uh, that's Michael's idea. Oh, where's Michael? Oh, uh-- Probably just in a meeting. It's going to be such a beautiful wedding, Mrs. Takatori. But it's so loud. Is the ocean always loud like this? Well, yes, unfortunately, nature is the one thing that we can't control. Oh, God. Well, let's go taste some cake. Oh, okay. You like cake, right, Mom? You know why we can't be together? No. Because you're a nonbeliever. What? Yeah. You don't believe in love. That's ridiculous. Of course I do. No, you don't. You don't believe that the love you have for someone today... can be everlasting. That's why you're never gonna get married. That's why we couldn't be together. Because I'm a believer. And this girl you're with... is a believer? She is. Well, congratulations. Wait. Just because two people are believers... don't mean that they're always necessarily meant for each other. Then why are you with her? I love her. What? What? Uh-- Why would you-- a believer-- be with someone you love but don't want to marry? I didn't say I don't want to marry her. Yeah, you kinda did. No, I didn't. Well, do you want to marry her? I don't think she's ready. But do you want to marry her? Why would I want to marry someone who isn't ready? I don't know, um-- Why marry at all? Why not just... love the one you're with? How was your day, sweetie? Oh, it was good. How was your day? Oh, it was swell. I didn't get a chance to sit down or eat, but, other than that, it was wonderful. Thanks for asking. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. My life is-- is really good. You'll see. Everything is-- is gonna be fine. Yeah, I promise. ♪ I was the lady in red last Saturday night ♪ Oh, my gosh! Kai, what are you doing here? Shh. Kai? What are you-- Lily, um-- Shh. We're dating. Don't tell Mom. I'm going to tell her tomorrow. What's going on? Did someone scream? Uh, I saw a cockroach. Make sure you kill it. All I need is a cockroach crawling into my bed. Been there, done that. Okay. Are you mad? Mad? Well, it's weird, right? Yeah, it's weird. I gotta go. What? Where are you going? You just got here. Kai. Kai, please. Come on, don't go. It's totally cool. What the "H"? You told James to mail my stuff here? That's a fantastic idea, Mother. Now you've just cut me off from my entire life. James is a great guy. And-And he cares about you. He's got a good job. And he doesn't mind your whole artsy obsession with photographs. You know, good guys like that do not grow on trees. You have to stop projecting your failed love life onto me. I-- I just want what's best for you. Marriage and stability is what's best for you. What did I do wrong? What-- What's going on? James mailed back all her stuff from the mainland. What? Why? Mom wants Lily to marry him. He's marriage and stability. I'm dating Kai. Lily's Kai? Why is everything Lily's? Lily's song! Lily's Kai! What about me? Don't yell at me. I didn't do anything to you. He's been different ever since she got here! Calm down, Hoku! Cheese and crackers! You know, just because I'm polite and I'm considerate... and I make a conscious effort not to swear... does not mean that you and you and you can just walk all over me... and treat me like some kind of a dog, okay? I deserve attention too! So, mister, you're gonna enjoy this area. This is Hawaii nei, so-- Okay. Beautiful weather, no problems. Whoa. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. No worries about it. I get 'em. I get 'em. I live in this area. From here. Oh! Check out all the ladies! Here you go. What, you think you can hook one brudda up? Maybe small kine. Just throw in my numbers like that? The one with the 'upepe nose? Wha', maybe she get some action for me, huh? I didn't understand a word of that, but here you go. Keep the change. Who's that? James? James is hot. Listen, James. Whoa. We had an understanding. It just didn't feel right. Oh, okay. You're on your own, kid. I-- I just wanted you back. And I got your message, and I realized I was losing you. We don't have to get married... ever. We don't. Let's just go back to being you and me, like always. Kai? Mother, I'm dating Kai, and... we're getting married. Oh! Is that right? You know what? My mind-- it has been swirling since I got here. And you can always put me right back on track. And I need that in my life. Yeah. Yes! I knew we could work it out. I love you, Lily. How's it? Hey, it's Brudda Larry, Ph.D., your Hawaii love doctor. Are you lonely? Are you divorced or maybe widowed? Or maybe you never met that special someone? No waste time! Honolulu's biggest mature singles convention is this weekend! Come meet relationship experts. Visit the booths. You might even get lucky! Money cannot buy you love, but money can get you a ticket to my convention. Is there anyone else here? No. What are you doing here? Why did you tell everybody we were getting married? You gotta get asked before you announce something like that. That's kinda how it works. Look, I'm sorry. I just-- I got excited, you know? Lily's guy came back, and she's always making herself the center of attention, and I got carried away. Oh, I'm gonna miss him. Um, if you wanna talk, come with me. Hurry. I gotta go. Where are we? Waimanalo. Yeah, I know that, but why? - Hey, that's Roy! - Duck! Are you following Roy? No. Then what are you doing? Yes, I'm following Roy. Why? What'd he do? He's cheating on Twinny. With who? I don't know. That's what we're gonna find out. How do you know he's cheating? Because we know! It's a womanly instinct thing. He's been working late a lot. Ah. He's just working late. Mom called his office. He's never there when he's supposed to be. And I've seen him in Waikiki with a girl. Does Twinny know? So, is Michael excited about the sake bar? We got 12 different types, all from Japan. I don't know, 'cause when he says, "Oh, I don't mind. You take care of it," it's just code for "I don't wanna deal with it. You... do it." Oh, but you know, that's perfectly natural. The truth is, Tina, there are just certain things... that we women are better at than men, right, Lily? Like-- Like planning parties or weddings... or kids, you know, shopping. No. I'm a woman, and I hate shopping... and planning parties and kids. Okay, but you're a freak. You hate kids? No. Look, what I'm trying to say is that after the wedding, the dynamic, it just seems to change. Men and women, all of a sudden, have these labels... and distinct corners. I know, but me and Michael never had corners before. We were-- We were cornerless. No, no, no, no, no. There's no corners. No corners are here. Everything's gonna be fine, I promise. Let's taste some of that tempura. This is good. Oh. Numi. Come, come. Let's go. Great. Go put it up. Tell everybody about it. Excuse me. Have you signed out? Uh, I didn't know I was supposed to. All children must be signed out. Are you on Numi's pick-up roster? I don't know. The parents need to call and authorize you. I am the parent. I'm sorry. I only see Twinny's name here... and their grandma, Miriam Wolf. I'm the father-- Roy. Roy Aukai. I'll need to speak with their mother before I can let you take her. Girl, tell this lady I'm your daddy. This isn't funny. Numi, let's go. I've never seen you before. Anybody recognize him? Anybody? Does he look familiar? This is ridiculous. He's not going with her. I have to fold a thousand of these stupid cranes! Do you know how many he has to fold? One! What for? It's this wonderful Japanese tradition, you know, where it symbolizes the longevity... and-and, uh, fidelity and her patience... and the success of the marriage. It's a beautiful tradition. It really is, you know? It's like ikebana or hibachi. Oh. Excuse me. Be right back. - Hello? Roy? - How come I'm not on the pick-up roster? Oh, sh-- Because I forgot to call and tell them you were coming. I'm sorry. You wanted me to do more. I'm doing more. At least I'm trying to do more. Let me talk to the teacher, okay? People try to tell you that a wedding isn't going to change your life. But the real question is, does marriage make your life better? - Does it? - I don't think so. I mean, you gotta put up boundaries and expectations... and-- When I met James, I just told him no marriage, no kids, no cooking. Have you done that? No. You need to do that. That's what I need to do. We cannot just let every Tom, Dick and Harry, auntie, uncle, brother, sister, come into this place, okay? It's not safe. If you need another orientation, you can come on in... and I'll be glad to talk with you. We can fill out the form together. Where's Tina? We were just chatting. Then she had to-- About what? Huh? - How marriage is so awful? - I was just giving my advice, my opinion. You know what? This whole issue with the evils of marriage-- that is your thing, okay? Tina is a client, so just shut the front door for once... and stop giving people your opinion! You know what? I'm not getting married. Because if it ain't broke, why fix it, right? Whoo! Cheers! Oh. Okay. Thank you so much. I feel so much better. Mmm. Stupid! Where are you going? I need some space... so I don't punch you in the head! Twinny, I am sorry. Don't say it! Don't tell me you're sorry! God, "sorry" doesn't live here anymore. You've done this to me my entire life! You just do whatever you want without thinking about anybody else! And then I'm the one left cleaning up your mess! What are you talking about? You've never cleaned up my mess before. Bull-sheep, Lily! You just don't know because you never stick around long enough to see the damage that unfolds! I told you that I shouldn't be Tina's wedding planner. Oh, this isn't about Tina Takatori! Then what? Who was it that stuck around to help Mom with her business? Me. What? And then who was it that had to break Kai's heart... by telling him you moved to the mainland without saying good-bye? That was me, Lily! God! Why do you think everyone thinks that I am your older sister? Because you're always pregnant. Oh! Come on. I have looked up to you my entire life. And you've never once been able to deliver. I just keep giving you all these chances... because I really wanna be able to look up to you, Lily! But my two biggest disappointments growing up... were Mom and you. Oh, yeah? Yeah? Well, maybe you're so busy cleaning up everybody else's life because... you just don't have the guts to look at your own crappy reality! And that is not my-- Twinny. Twinny! Does she need some help? Oh, my God. Call for help! I need help! Oh, my God. Is she okay? Help! This is not what I signed up for! You're always in jail or you're always drunk! I made a mistake. I didn't know there was a roadblock! I just had one drink with the guys! What, I can't go out by myself? You're acting like a child, and I need you to act like a father! I can't handle this! I can't! No! I'm out of here! Fine! Go! Just go! Get out! Hey, sweetheart. Daddy's gonna go away for a little while. I love you. Take care of each other. Daddy's gotta go. It's okay. It's okay. It'll get better. What are you doing? Here. When my dad left, it was the worst day in my life. And now it's the worst day in your life. Lily! And you should remember it, so when other bad stuff happens, you can look at this picture and see it's not so bad. I want my daddy. Daddies aren't meant to stay. He isn't gonna come back? Let's go play. Now? I don't wanna go. I wanna wait. My daddy's coming back. Marriage is the most magical thing that a couple could ever make. Grow up, Hoku. That's just what Mom says to sell weddings. I've got you. Don't go, Twinny. I won't. Don't worry. Don't go, Twinny. I won't. I'm right here. Don't go. You can't leave me. Hold on, Twinny. I got you. I am right here. Lily! It's okay. I'm so sorry. No, there's nothing to be sorry about. Everything's gonna be fine. Don't you worry about a thing, okay? It's okay. Don't worry. Oh, he's sneaky. Going somewhere no one will recognize him. Mom, I got him. What? Slow down. Oh, God. Should I tell him? Okay. Oh, you slimy cheater. You are so busted! Nah, I think he's over there. Sorry. Who was that? Do you know her? Roy, what are you doing? You work here? What are you guys doing here? Look, you gotta go. Twinny was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. What? Let's get the hell outta here! Let's go! Move! Ma, I think she wants out. It seems that way. No, I mean-- I mean, I don't think she wants to be here. Twinny, why would you say something like that? Because she can read my mind, okay? And I don't think she likes what she's coming into. Oh, sweetie. Come on. Just relax. Do you want a mint or something? What the-- Where have you been? I was working. I called your office, and they said you left hours ago. I know you've been lying about working nights. Your running around is the reason that she's in the hospital. Come here with this crazy getup. Mom, he's clean. He got another job. You got another job? It's not important. How are you feeling? My blood pressure dropped a little bit, but I'm fine. How's the baby? She's fine, honey. Look, she's kicking like crazy. Why did you get another job? With the baby on the way and all the stress you got at work, I thought if I could bring in more cash, maybe you could quit. You're a waiter? Yeah, at the Hukilau Grill. Oh! But you hate Waikiki. Yeah, but I love you. You hukilau for me? Girl, I hukilau for us. I think I'm gonna get going, let you have some time with your family. No! Don't go. I need you. Unless that's weird for you. No. You're part of the family now. Oh, the Yamamoto wedding. Mom and I can handle it. I know, but the timetable, seating charts-- No, I can do it. I'll just download the file tomorrow. You sure you know how to do that? There are computers on the mainland too, Mom. You just take care of you, okay? I'm sorry. You make her happy. You hukilau for her. Hi! The veil! Whoo! Don't run. Don't run. The reason you can't find it is because you're on the wrong street. You need to make a left on Kalakawa. You need to make a left on-- Yes, that's exactly right. And we'll be there in about 10 minutes. Hai. Hai. Hai. Whoa. Danger. Danger! Danger. The bride is missing. The mom just told me. You speak Japanese? Mm, a little. Oh, okay. I got this. Uh, James, come with me. I'm gonna need a translator. My Japanese is not that good. Thanks for meeting me. I really appreciate it. See, in a few hours, this place will be everything she ever dreamed of. But it's a show. It's temporary. You can't get so hung up on the wedding production. The real thing is the two of you. But you stood your ground. I didn't get what I wanted though. I never talked to him. I'm sure James knows. Talk to Michael... and be honest. Be brutally honest so that he gets it. I think it's too late for us. I don't think so. Michael. How did you know she was gonna be here? Something about these jellies makes a girl rethink her future. I think she's asking me if the jellies in the ocean... are-- are happier than the jellies in the tank. Tell her... I don't know. They're safe and not alone, but... I don't know if that's enough. You're talkin' about the jellyfish, right? She'll understand. I think we're losing her. This is your day. You are ready. Well, James. Are you okay? I was forcing her to marry me. I'm still forcing her to. Sometimes people need a nudge. Okay. Hey. We need to talk. It's all good. It was a weird fluke. Not for me. We don't want the same things. Hoku-- she is the believer.

We should be there within the hour, so sit back, relax and enjoy the flight. Mahalo. Hey. What are you doing here? I don't know. I just moved without thinking. What? Since I've been back, I have, um-- I felt things like my heart and my hands-- they tingled. I keep telling myself that forever is a really long time, and then I realized that I-I have been in love with you... since high school, and I still love you. And I could go back to L.A.... and listen to my brain, but then I would know it was wrong. Um-- So I followed you here... to tell you that. And I didn't really plan much else to say, so this is a little... awkward. Are you proposing? What? Yeah, you are on one knee. I knew that you were a believer. You just had to figure it out. Mmm. Mmm. Aloha. Welcome. We're about to get started, so please take your seats. Thank you. Mahalo. Thank you. Do you think she'll make it through the ceremony? Ten bucks she'll bolt before the vows. Oh.
