You know these fish are the symbol of perseverance? - What? - (Everest grunts excitedly) (Yi chuckles) It's, uh... it's just something my mom told me. It means that, when things get really tough... ...they never give up. You know what, guys? We have to keep going. Come on. Come on, you guys, let's go.
