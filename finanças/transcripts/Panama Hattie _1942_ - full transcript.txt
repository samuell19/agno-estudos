Boy, that Hattie's got somethin'. - Could I go for her? - Never. Not a chance. She protects herself like she was the Panama Canal. Well, maybe she's afraid of sabotage. Sabotage. Hey, looked a date, huh? What's up the matter with that dame you were chasing last night with the long arms and the bare feet? You know, I think there was something wrong with her. Just as I got ready to kiss her, she ran up a coconut tree. Cigars, cigarettes, chewing tobacco. - What flavor? - You got anything else, girly? Has she? Say, you must be blind. How come a girl with a face like that works in a joint like this? - I was drafted. - Say, babe. I think I could do something for you. I can get you a job on the ship, $21 a month, room and board. Hey! Do you want somethin' or don't ya? Well.. Maybe she's a spy. - We ought to investigate her. - That's a good idea. Hey, stop it. What are you looking for? How 'bout that. No bubble gum, huh? No. Say, uh, what are you doing later.. No. Kid must be Russian. She won't give in. Girl, you better watch him. He's a wolf. Yeah, I'm a wolf in ship's clothing. Can't understand why they reject guys with flat feet and take 'em with flat heads! Cigars, cigarettes. [indistinct singing] Shh. I think she's calling her mate. [swing music] [applause] [music continues] [music continues] [trumpet music] [applause] - Hiya, fellas! - How are you, Hattie? - Hello, beautiful. - How are ya? I'm okay, fellas. You can put your hats on. There's no ladies present. Hey, Hattie, you wanna go to a movie with us tonight, huh? Yeah, it's a swell picture. "Masie The Beautiful Laundry Girl." Ah! She gives me a pain. Say, I haven't seen you guys since the day we caught the spy. Honest, Hattie, I wouldn't be surprised if we all got promoted. Yeah, to the intelligence department. Him too? - What's so funny about that? - Oh, he's pretty smart. When he was in the first grade, he was voted by his class as the one most likely to stay there. See? - Is that bad? - No, Ragsy. Sometimes it's good to be that way. Sure, you get twice as much sleep as anybody else in the same length of time. You see, Ragsy, smart people have to think and worry and figure a lot to make mistakes. But you don't have to go to all that trouble. Oh, gee, thanks. Now, when I left Indiana and landed in Panama I thought it was the biggest mistake of my life. - But it turned out it wasn't. - Well, you met us. Yeah, I met you. You've been a regular pal. The only break I ever got, I got right here in this town. Dick Bulliard. - Oh! - Oh! - Are you gonna marry that guy? - I sure am. How can a smart girl like you marry a soldier? Dick's a different kinda soldier. Nah! What makes him so different? A sailor wouldn't understand that. [laughs] - You're terrific. - Hat, you know your own heart. If you wanna marry him, you go right ahead. And every time we're in port, we'll come over and teach your kids how to fight. Well, supposin' I fool you and just have girls. Well, then, we'll just come over. Well, um, fellas, I gotta go outside and think. Uh, you want me to come out and help you? No, tootsie. Hey, what's the matter with her? - We better go and find out. - Yeah, come on. What's on your mind, Hattie? Oh, nothin'. Except Dick's been married before. - What? - Yeah, and he's got a kid. - Eight years old. - Why, that no good-- - I'll divide that lug by three. - Now, wait a minute, fellas. That was long before he met me. - You sure? - Sure. He's a society guy from Philadelphia and rich and all that. You know. - Oh, well, that's different. - I'll say it's different. I can't marry him till I've seen that kid of his. They're from the other side of the tracks and I don't wanna get run over crossing them. - So, when do you meet the kid? - She gets here tomorrow. We'll be there to see there ain't no clippin' from behind. Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas. Tomorrow's an awful important day for me and I appreciate your interest and all that.. But, this is kind of personal and.. Well, you know how it is. Now, you know, we're on your side, don't you, Hattie? I sure do. [bugle call] - Hiya, sergeant. - Hi, Hat. Halt! Let's see your pass. - That's okay. - Look. - You got it? - Yeah. Bring him back alive, Hattie. Ho-ho! Two whole weeks. 14 days to be with you. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. - Gee that's swell. - Where's your bodyguard? Oh, they won't be with us today. For some reason, they're beginnin' to trust you. Oh, I thought they might still be out chasin' spies. I wouldn't be surprised. They think everybody's a spy but Roosevelt. - You're terrific. - Better be careful, sergeant. Say that often enough and I'm liable to believe you. Wait till you see that little bungalow I rented for us. - Us? - Oh. I mean, my daughter Geraldine and I, while she's here with me. - Oh. - We're going there now. - You mind? - Why? No. I'd love to see her. Think of it. Two weeks in a house again, with that kid around, too. You know, I haven't seen her for a year and a half. Hey! I wonder if she'll remember me. That's a long time in a child's life, isn't it? Well, I can't remember. [indistinct chatter] Pardon me. United States Navy. - Oh! A boat. - Yeah. [Gerry] 'Daddy.' Gerry! Gerry, darling. Yeah, I wished I was meeting my kid. When did that happen? I'm just wishing, Red, nothing tangible. What, what is that standing next to her? Oh, that's the butler. He's been in the family for years. You must have a rugged family. I don't like his face. Hey! Spy. - Gerry. - Daddy. Oh, daddy. I'm so glad to be here with you. Did you have a nice trip, angel? [Gerry] 'I thought we'd never get here.' 'It's very far away from St. Kitts, isn't it?' [Dick] 'Yeah, quite a way.' - If you don't mind. - Oh, hello, Jerkins. - How are ya? - I have felt happier, sir. - And you? - Oh, very happy. Splendid, I'll go look after the luggage, sir. Alright, meet us at the Hotel Patio in half an hour. Very good, sir. That guy looks like a dud that didn't go off. Gerry, I want you to meet three friends of mine. - Rags, Red, and Rowdy. - First to hangnail, Gerry. - How do you do? - Welcome to Panama, Gerry. - Thank you so much. - Hello, peaches. Are you going steady with anyone? [all laughing] - Why, Dick Bulliard. - Leila. Of all people. Hello, hello, hello. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. I can't believe it. - In uniform too. - That's right. Ah. But you're in the wrong branch of the service. Must be a talent scout for the navy. Uh, this is my daughter, Leila. You don't say. Hello, hello, hello. Oh, this dame's in a rut. This is Ms. Tree, darling. I saw you aboard ship. I'm sorry, I wish I had known. - What's cookin', Brenda? - Hey, wait a minute. - Do you know who she is? - No. She's the admiral's niece. - Do you know who I am? - No. Thank goodness. Well, this ought to make her eyes pop, huh, Flo? Yeah, if it doesn't blind her. Gee. Isn't this outfit a three alarm fire? Honey, you look like Mrs. Flash Gordon. You wanna wear some of these bracelets? Yeah, I'd love to. Mm, I haven't got room enough for 'em. Any suggestions? Don't you think the earrings are little too much? Oh, don't be silly. I only wish I had four ears. Seems to me there's somethin' missin'. Here, won't be needin' this until dinner. Ah! Well, bring her on. I'm ready. I don't know what this kid's been used to but I'll bet it was never anything like this. Well, come on. Let's get going. Oh, no, Flo. You go ahead and meet him. I don't wanna stand in the sun too long or I'll look like one of those wilted salads. Oh, I see. You wanna make an entrance, eh? Well... you know, it's my big moment. You're terrific. - Good luck, honey. - Thanks. Well, Gerry, this is the square, the prettiest spot in town. - How do you like it? - Oh, it's beautiful. I never saw a place that looks so little like Philadelphia. - How do you like it, Starky? - Very exciting. - Hello, sergeant. - Hello, Flo. Hattie'll be down in a minute. Oh, thanks. This is my daughter, Geraldine. Gerry, this is Ms. Flo. - How do you do? - Pleased to meet ya. Thank you. And I'll be pleased to meet you too. - Thank you, miss. - Daddy, look! - Hiya, soldier. - Hi, Hat. Gerry, I want you to meet the sweetest girl in the Panama Canal zone, Ms. Hattie Maloney. Oh, and you're little Geraldine. Gee, I didn't know you'd be a little doll. [laughing] - What's the gag? - I'm going to like you. I like people who dress up funny. Gerry! Hey, wait a minute. Now, don't get excited, Hattie. She's just a little-- Yeah-yeah-yeah, I know what she is. Here I go and blow three weeks' pay to make an impression on her and what do I get? The gall! She didn't mean any harm. Darling, you should apologize to the lady. I'm very sorry, Ms. Maloney. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. But I just couldn't believe those were your serious clothes. There she goes again. - Madam? - Yes. Maybe if you would remove that hat. Listen, you're a butler, ain't ya? - Yes, madam. - Now, just but! Yes, relax, Jerkins. Now, darling. Tell the lady you're sorry and don't put anything on the end of it. - Honestly, I'm very sorry. - Get her outta here! - Oh, now, wait a minute. - You two should get together-- If we get together, it'll take a crowbar to separate us. Oh, don't be that way, Hattie. She's just a child. And when she sees something funny, she just laughs. Oh, so, now, you think I look funny? Oh, no, no! I.. Well, you can just get out of here too! Oh, Hattie, you know I don't think you look funny. Don't you, daddy? Um-- If you don't get that piece of Philadelphia scrapple out of here, I'll dip her in the canal! - But, Hattie, look-- - "But, Hattie" my eyes! Get out of here, both of you. Go to a taxi and wait for me there. Thank you, sir. [Dick] 'Hattie?' Wait a minute, Hattie. You better talk fast, 'cause I'm in the mood for murder. - I'm awfully sorry, Hat. - Somebody ought to be sorry. Darling, Gerry's only an infant. You mustn't be upset. Well, she can't use me for target practice. You know, she didn't mean it. And I'm gonna talk to her. - You needn't bother. - What does that mean? Well, I'm just a three-ring circus as far as she's concerned. - That's not true, Hattie. - Sure it is. She looked at me like I was quarantined. Well, you can tell her for me she doesn't have to like me. No one has to like me. Well, I still think you're terrific. Look, the next time if somebody calls me terrific I'm gonna slug 'em. - Even me? - Even anybody. And if she was my kid, I'd teach her some etiquette!

Yeah, that worries me. She hasn't had a drink in over a year. What's the occasion? Love. That wonderful thing, love. I guess it's wonderful. [slot machine rattling] - You gonna play some more? - No, I finished. - Go ahead. Play another one. - No, I finished. - You sure? - Definitely!

Just say "Once". That's all. "Once, tuh! That's all." No. Just say once and do this.. Once. Once, tuh! Not my mouth, your mouth. Now, just say once, and do this.. Once. Then, stop. Once. I made it. Tuh! I have a very important message for Ms. Maloney. Well, give it to me. I'll see that she gets it. I'm sorry, but I must deliver it myself. [sniffling] [sobs] [glass clinks] I don't know what you drink that stuff for. No kick to it. I've been in every bar in the world. Without a doubt, that's the weakest stuff I've ever had. Think I'll go get a drink. [thuds] [Jerkins coughing] Madam, don't do that! You're either a sourpuss, the butler, or his twin brother and I don't like both of you. Take him away. This, I feel, is the beginning of a very obnoxious friendship. None of your fancy remarks or you'll be wearin' a cuspidor as a snoot. Hattie, he's got a message for you. - From who? - It's from Mr. Bulliard. - I don't want it. - Oh, I'm sorry, madam. But, will you please take it just this once? Tuh! But I don't have to read it. Oh. Yes, I almost forgot. Ms. Geraldine wanted me to say that she meant to tell you this afternoon-- What? It sounds a little silly coming from me. But she says you have the most beautiful eyes she ever saw. - Gerry said that? - That is her opinion, madam. [instrumental music] Here, Ragsy, you read it. I can't make out what it says. Oh, I can't go around reading other people's mail. "Hattie, darling. "I am coming over for you in the morning. '"Gerry is sorry for the way she acted' '"and wants to apologize.' 'Love always, Dick."' And Gerry thinks I got beautiful eyes. Hmph. Ain't that somethin'? [instrumental music] Hey, wait a minute, fellas. Take it easy, will ya? Slow down. Nobody's gonna take that away from ya. You guys are eatin' like there's no tomorrow. I don't see how you can eat after last night, anyway. Oh. Don't your hangover feel good? Oh, yeah, yeah, fine. My head feels like I can scratch it out here. Oh, wait a minute, brother. Don't stir it up. - Oh, Hattie. - How are ya, Flo? - Hi, Flo. - Hello. Gee, honey, I was afraid I'd miss ya. Hey, aren't you somethin'? What's up? Well, I want you to do me a favor. You're going out to Dick's this morning, aren't ya? - Yeah. - Oh, could I go, too? The minute I saw that English muffin yesterday the heart left the body. [all] Aww! You mean you really fell for that little kid's chambermaid? - Honest, Hattie, I got it bad. - Okay, babe. But you'll have to excuse me, my head's killin' me. - I have to see a plumber. - Thanks. Come on, Sea Biscuit. All my life I've wanted to know how it seemed to get a refined kiss.

Yes, yes, by all means. Let's skip it. Eh, Dick, I wanted to invite you aboard uncle's ship tomorrow evening. It's the ship's birthday party. Oh, thank you, Leila. Hattie and I have a date tomorrow. How about it, Hat? Would you do me the honor? Well, if it's okay with you, it's okay with me. What will I wear? Oh, anything but what you have on. Okay, dearie.

Okay. - Ms. Tree? - Yes. - Who gave you this? - A sailor, miss. What? Where is he? - In the patio, ma'am. - Show him to me. Hiya, babe. You, you? Was it you who sent me this note? Oh, stop talking like a calliope and sit down. Come on. Put it on the wood. - Sit down. Sit down. - Well? Well, in the first place, maybe you don't know it but everybody in town's talking about you. Talking about me? Oh, what do you mean? I mean, what can people say about me? What have I done? Hey, what you've done is what you didn't done. What didn't I done? I mean, what haven't I done? I'm glad you asked me that. Not that I'm interested in you personally but you're a nice kid, and I'd like to help you out. 'Cause I think they've got you all wrong. Well, I should say they have. Now, the first thing you should do, bein' the admiral's niece you should be seen around a lot with an ordinary sailor. Would that be good? Oh, honey, that'd be wonderful. 'Course, sailors don't get much dough. You may have to pick up a check now and then but it would be worth it. But, but I don't know any sailors. Well, in that case, I'll help you out. You? Couldn't I get a better looking one? Well, if you're gonna go shoppin' around I'll get out of the mood. But I mean, how could I possibly be seen with you? Okay. Then we won't let 'em see us. Why? You.. - How'd you do, Red? - Oh, swell. Why, I swept her right off her feet. No kiddin'. I grabbed her, and I hugged her, and I kissed her. I can still feel where she kissed me. Little kid, she was going to give me a battleship. If I'd have kept on her, I'd have had a whole Navy. She's nothin', but I got a date with her for tonight. Oh, yeah? How'd he do, Rowdy? Come in. [door opens] Well, Ms. Tree. This is an unforeseen pleasure. What do you mean by putting that sailor up to insulting me? - A sailor? - You know the one I mean. Oh, don't go, Flo. Oh, Hattie, I've got a few bodies to bury and I think there'll be more room outside. You're trying to belittle me in the eyes of Dick Bulliard. But it won't work, Ms. Maloney. You've had it all your own way. But I'm here now, and we'll see whether or not you get your hooks into him. You know, it's a funny thing, Ms. Tree. But my mind kinda wanders sometimes and I'm sure I didn't hear that last remark you made. And I think this'd be a wonderful time for you to leave. Besides, I have to catch up on some readin'. - Oh, you read? - Oh, yeah. Yes, I can read. And I'm reading a story now about a poor girl and a rich boy. The rich boy has everything he wants in the world except he never learned how to be happy. Well, it happens that the poor girl falls in love with the rich boy and he suddenly realizes she's the first person who's ever been on the level with him. And in the end, she marries him? Well, I can't tell yet. But, it looks like they'll live happily ever after. Well, that's too bad because the story doesn't end that way. Oh, it doesn't? Why? Because the rich boy suddenly sees the light and realizes that getting married is not a ten-day furlough. I don't believe he thinks that. Then wait till you get to the ending. I don't believe it. 'Cause he held me in his arms and told me that he loved me. And I suppose the music was playing. What did you expect him to say? Is he the first man whoever held you in his arms and said he loved you? [Leila] 'Or, do you, by any chance, think you're the first woman?' He once told a chorus girl he loved her and it cost his father $20,000. He once told another woman he loved her, he even married her. Well, that was different. Please, Ms. Tree, no tricks. We're not talking about a weekend in the country, you know. Alright, no tricks. You love him and he loves you. But that's not quite enough. Well, it's enough for me to start on. - But not enough to finish. - I'd rather not talk about it. Do you mind? Very well. I can see you're going to make me say it. You can't marry Dick Bulliard because your two and his two won't add up to four. You haven't got enough to go on. Dick's lived his kind of life too long to change and it would fight you and choke you and make him miserable. You'd struggle against his background and you'd never be able to lick it. You'd be in his way, Ms. Maloney. A man can get over anything, but you mustn't be in his way. Okay, Ms. Tree. You've dropped your little bombshell and now you can go. But bring this up in your social register. They threw the book away on the kinda love I have for him. So you'll do me the favor of not callin' it a one-night stand. - I only-- - You can go now, Ms. Tree. [instrumental music] Hey, Rags. This isn't the note I sent her. That waiter! - Keep your eye on that waiter. - Why? I think we've run onto something again. - Spies? - Shh. Shh. Spies. Shh. [knocking on door] Come in. - Oh, hiya, sailors. - How are you, Hattie? Hey, Hattie, w-we heard that you-- Uh, well, Hattie. Flo said you were going away. She's only kiddin', ain't she? No, she isn't. Oh, Hattie, you can't do that to us. Yup. Hot or cold, I'm leavin' tomorrow. Oh, that's kinda crazy. Who's gonna holler at us? - Well, I don't know. But-- - Hey, Hattie. Close the door. - Look, we got a note here. - A note? - Shh! - Shh! S-P-I-Z. [all] Spies. - What again? - Yeah. Tonight in the old haunted house. We got the whole thing figured out. Yeah, first we sneak in and catch 'em. Single-handed. And then we get the reward. If you'll stay here.. We'll tell everybody it was your idea. Yeah, just like the Secret Service. And then we'll give you half of the reward. Is that a plan? Is that dynamite or ain't it? Yeah, it's great, fellas. But I have to leave. Oh, gee, Hattie, without you the.. ...navy's gonna seem like the army. Ain't there nothin' we can do? Couldn't we kill somebody or somethin'? No, I have to leave. The league's gettin' too fast for me, boys. Well, what's with that gettin' married? Ah, the trick of the stenographers. I couldn't go for that little white house with the little green blinds. Unh-unh. Brass bands, plenty of smoke, and a room full of suckers. That's my department. Well, Hattie, we, uh.. - Yes, Hattie, you-you see-- - Oh, oh, look, Hattie. - Maybe if-- - Oh, it's alright. I know how ya feel, fellas, and it's alright. Come on. Sit down, will ya? I gotta do a number pretty soon and I may not see you before I go, so.. Fellas, the book says a girl's lucky if she meets one real right guy in her life. Well, I met three. And you're it. Rowdy.. ...you're just silly and stupid.. ...and beautiful. And, Red.. ...you're just a big baboon that never got out of the first grade and I love you. And, Ragsy.. ...you're on a private war all by yourself. And don't you ever stop believin' in Santa Claus or I'll hate you. [Rowdy sniffles] [owl hoots] Wait till we get in that spy house. I'll tear them spies apart. You know, I come from the bravest family.. - You ever saw. - You did? My grandfather used to be an old sea pirate. Oh, yeah? Well, my grandfather came across the plains in '49. He didn't even carry a gun. He used to knock those Indians off with a buggy whip. Ah, that's nothin'. My grandfather fought in the Civil War. Once, he caught a cannonball in his bare hands. Caught a cannonball in his bare hands? Yup. Armless Joe, they used to call him. - Phew. - Ah! [owl hooting] Look, even the bats won't go in. I was just thinking, may-maybe we were a little too hasty about this thing. Yeah, I think I'll go back and get my revolver. - Where'd you leave it? - Evanston, Illinois. Well, hurry up back. - Whoa, whoa.. - Wait a minute! Come on. [owl hooting] [cat screeching] What's the matter with you? I washed my legs this morning. I can't do a thing with 'em. - Oh! - Oh. [cat mewling] Oh, my God! - Why don't you knock? - Yeah, why don't you knock? Go ahead and knock. - Nobody home, I hope. - I hope. I hope. Good, try the door knob. - Shh. - Shh. [door creaking] [owl hooting] I wonder what it cost 'em a week keep this place so dirty? Hey. there's a light, Rags. Go turn it on. Well, nobody here. Let's go. Wait a minute! How do you know there's nobody here? Somebody might even be in that cupboard. Go on, go find out. Go on. Go on.. You're under arrest. Come on out.. Oh! Nobody came out. How do you know nobody came out? Did you see that picture, "The Invisible Man?" Yeah, there could be six guys in this room right now. And that's not counting us. [gasps] What am I doin'? Go on. Open it up. Alright, don't shove. Don't shove. See? I told you there's nobody in there. [door slams] Hey! Don't do that! Go on. Go on. Got a load of this layout. I wonder what they do with that stuff. Well, they ain't makin' fudge. Hey, I got it. It's explosives. [gasps] That's all, brother. Come here. If we can get evidence on these spies we might even be cited for bravery. Just if that stuff goes off, you'll be sighted two miles over Iceland. [glass clinking] Hey, take it easy, we can get five cents back on the bottle. [laughs] It's safe. [all exclaim] Will you stop fooli'' with that stuff? You know I'm allergic to dynamite. Oh, I wish a sheriff would walk in here right now and give me just 20 seconds to get out of town. Twenty seconds? What do you gotta do, pack a trunk? And to think I could've been mushin' with Gladys. What's that? - Whoa! - Whoa! That's a spy glass. What are you supposed to do with that? Look at the canal, of course. - Can you see the canal? - No. But I see some dame neckin' a soldier on the verandah of the Marine Ho-- [gasps] Here.. I'll take another look at that soldier and if we ever run into him we can take the candy away from him. Boy, he sure is a homely palooka. Wonder how she got mixed up with that ape. Uh-oh. Here they come. Oh, here they come. Who comes? - The two spies. - Whoa! Hey, come here. You can't go out there. You'll run into 'em. Look, I joined the navy to see this world not the next. - What's that? - It's a door knob or some.. - We better hide. - Where are we gonna hide? - In the, in the cupboard. - In the cupboard. Hey, Rags, go turn off the light. Hey, let me in there. Let me in there. Go somewhere else, there's no room in here. I-I'll make room in there. Let me in there. [indistinct chattering] [door creaking] [creaking] - Well, we don't want any-- - Grab him! Get him. [grunting] I got him. [Red] 'Give him the rabbit, Rags, give him the rabbit.' Hey. Hey! Look, I'm on your side. - Remember? - He blew. But you can bet your life we're gonna hear from him. Yeah, well, I hope it's by letter. [gunshot] - The mail is in. - Come on. [Rags] 'Nah, we certainly made short work of those guys.' [gunshot] - Hey, Rags, turn on that light. - I guess we scared him away. - 'Yeah, I guess so.' - 'Yeah. I guess so.' - Let's get outta here. - Let's go. Hey, wait a minute, fellas. I've got a feeling there's somebody in this room. - Oh, we're here, ain't we? - I mean somebody besides us. Somebody, besides.. Don't do that! There's somebody here. I can feel it. You know, I'm physic. Come on, let's look around. Ah! Oh! They got me. They got me! Oh, it's that thing on the wall. [door creaking] [gasps] [alligators snarling] [panting] [alligator growling] Hey, Rowdy, did you find him? - Hey, Rags, where's Rowdy? - He was here a minute ago. Well, he couldn't get out. The door's locked. [knocking on door] - What is that? - Oh, must be termites. [Rowdy] 'Help, help! Red, Rags.' Help! Help! Rags! Red! - It's Rowdy. - It's Rowdy! - Hey, open.. - How do we get him out? I'll go get a hatchet and chop this wall down. Hey, Rowdy, how'd you get in there? Hey-y-y. [gunshot] Rags. What happened, Rags? Speak to me, Rags. Rags! You're not Rags. You're Rowdy. [gunshot] [door squeaking] [Red] 'Rags.' Red. Red.. Oh, it's Rags. Rags! Speak to me, speak to me! Oh. Get away. Get away. 'Don't you know fish are not supposed' to eat people on Friday? Go. Hey! Let me in! [Red] 'Let me in!' - Who is it? - That's Red. - Help him in. - Let me in. Let me in. [gunshots] Let me out! Let me out! Did you see those big things down there? - Yeah. - Them jag-a-lators. They stuff those things. Well, they ain't gonna stuff 'em with me. Let's get outta here. [gunshot] [whistles] Wait till I get my hands on that spy. I had a swell phone number written in that hat. Now, look at it. [gunshots] Close those shutters. I'm gettin' tired of ducking these bullets around here. I don't know why I ever let you to talk me into comin' to this place in the first place. I didn't talk you into it. It was your idea. I never had an idea in my life. [gunshot] [Red] 'I should've married that girl in Frisco' 'when her father asked me to.' [Rags] 'Yeah.' [gunshots] - 'Why?' - 'I'd try to live.' [Red] 'Hey did you hear somethin'?' [Rags] 'Yeah, listen. Shh.' [Red] 'What's the matter, you got a slow leak?' [Rags] 'I swear I heard something.' [Red] 'Oh, peek out, peek out. Maybe it's a spy.' 'Why don't you peek out?' [Rags] 'Oh, who wants to see an old spy?' [Red] 'Hey, maybe they're gonna burn down the house.' - 'Wouldn't that be funny?' - 'Oh, yeah, fine.' [Rags] 'And me without any marshmallows.' [gunshot] - Whoa. - Oh. This old rubbish.. That did it. Let's shove off. Chop that door down. Grab that axe! [banging on door] Hey, Rowdy, put that down. What do you wanna do, hurt somebody? Now, stop clowning around and help us chop this door down. [banging on door] - Hey. - Hey, Rowdy! Come back here! How do you like that guy running out on us? Yeah, how about that? What'd you runaway for, were you scared? Who was that other guy? I don't know. I thought he was a friend of yours. [gunshots] Why, you.. [glass shattering] [hissing] Run! [gunshots] - What's the matter? - Somebody shot my legs off. Oh. [gunshots] [explosion] Rags. Rags. Do something. Alright. [instrumental music] Mac? I wanted to say goodbye to you, Mac. - I'm gonna miss you, Hattie. - And I'm gonna miss you too. What's this, Ms. Maloney? - Going away? - Yes, I am. How 'bout one on the house before you go, Hattie? Okay, Mac. - How are you, Hattie? - Hi. Say, where will you be in New York? Well, I don't know yet, Red. New York? What an exciting place. Could I buy you a farewell bottle of champagne? Well, thanks, Mr. Kefler. But, that's a little rich for my blood. Well, it ain't for mine. You made a very sudden decision to leave Panama, didn't you? Yeah, I guess I did. Well, young lady, don't let it worry you. There are great many men left in the world who will throw themselves at your feet. I'm not very interested in that. No. Not right now, of course. Your heart is broken. And from my observation, a woman on the rebound is an easy target. Well, brother, you'd have to be an awful sharp shooter. Pardon me for saying so, but I think you are terrific. - That's it. - Oh, yes. You're trying to.. [indistinct chatter] [gunshot] [screaming] There's time enough to make the boat. Taxi! Taxi! Taxi. [clamoring] Hey, wait a minute! That ain't fair. You're wearin' brass knuckles. [clamoring continues] Go on. Go on. Go on. Oh! Go on. Go on. Hey, what say? Let's be buddies, huh? Okay. Oh, my! Mr. Bulliard! Mr. Bulliard! Jerkins, where are you? [Jerkins] 'I beg your pardon, sir' 'but I regret to inform you that' 'Ms. Maloney has left Panama' 'by boat for New York.' - What? - 'Yes, sir.' - 'It's the truth, sir.' - Why, that's crazy. She le.. Jerkins, are you sure? 'It's the truth, sir.' - What're we standing here for? - Well, oh.. Yeah, what are we standing here for? You know, fellas, I don't mind.. You know, fellas, I don't mind the beating we got. You don't mind? Well, speak for yourself, I do. Hey, did you see me give that big guy the one, three? "One, three?" What happened to two? Two, I got. I don't care how long they keep us here in the jug. The only thing I'm worried about, Hattie got away. Uh-oh! Here comes the house detective. Close that door, there's a draft in here. Okay, sailors, come on, get outta here. - Does that mean we are free? - I'll say you are. You know those three mugs you were fightin' with? - Yeah. - Well, you did it again. What do you mean, we did it again? - They're spies. - No kiddin'! - Spies! Come on. Let's go. - Come on. Let's go! Darn Venetian blinds! [instrumental music] [cheering] Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Folks, we wanna thank you for showing up at our coming out party, we just got outta jail. [laughing] So dark in there, you couldn't see where to scratch. [laughing] But this is more like it, like a nightclub. Of course, you know what a nightclub is. Gimme a chair. A nightclub is where high class people sit around like this. "What time's the floor show?" [laughing] Now, I want you to meet the other two heroes. Rags and Rowdy. [crowd cheering] This is Rags. Rags! [crowd cheering] Look at that intelligent face. The morning they handed out brains, he was caught without a ration card. [laughing] They didn't know about the five pounds I had hid away at home. [laughing] And this is Rowdy. [crowd cheering] You know, the night he was born, two storks fought to see who would bring him. Sort of a grudge fight. [laughing] I know everybody's anxious for the show to start. So we'd like for you to meet, in this corner at a 103 and a half pounds Smiling Flo. [crowd cheering] There's a face that was set for seven but it didn't go off.

Yes, Leila, we got married an hour ago. Oh. There goes Tree. [all] Timber! Hey, she's fainted. Shall I bring her to? No, not yet. Ooh. [spits] Come on, do something. If I do, I'd get my face smacked. I do-do. - How dare you? - Oh, you broke my little head. You broke my little head. Oh, don't go, Ms. Tree. I'm sorry. You remember me saying you should be seen the sailors? Well, now's your chance. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, come, come, Ms. Tree. The Navy needs volunteers, more girls to join up and help keep us sailors happy when we're ashore. Well, I'm willing to do my bit. But what can I do to make a sailor happy? Well, you could.. Are you kiddin'? [Red whistling] Oh, brother, for a blackout. - But what can I do? - Oh, you could do a lot. For instance, have you ever thought of bundling with blue jackets-I mean, making bundles for blue jackets? I think I'm beginning to see what you do mean. Oh, fine. You know, Ms. Tree, if a nice girl like you was to marry a big, strong successful man like me we could travel around, see the world together. That is, what's left of it.
