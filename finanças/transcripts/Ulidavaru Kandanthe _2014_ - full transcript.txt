Fishermen chanting. ﻿It's my hometown, Malpe. ﻿A major fishing town on the Arabian Coast of Karnataka. ﻿A town whose shores are cleansed everyday by the sea. ﻿But the waves can't reach everything. Can they? ﻿Fishermen chanting continues. ﻿Boy chanting with fishermen. ﻿Boy starts chanting again. ﻿I met him a few times during my college days. ﻿I feel he was attracted to me. ﻿Or was he just trying to annoy me? ﻿What would you call that? ﻿Or did he behave the same with everyone? I will never know. I would see him around during my visits to hometown. ﻿Incidentally, we met on that fateful day. So is it about him? The article you want to write. ﻿Regina? ﻿Are you here for that interview? ﻿Yes. ﻿Please follow me. ﻿No, No! It's not only about him. ﻿Then why a series? I mean, is it worth it? ﻿You can finish it in one article. ﻿No. ﻿There are many stories involved in this incident. ﻿A single article will not do justice to them. ﻿Madam, Can I get you a chair? ﻿No. Please open the cell. ﻿It's okay. I know him. ﻿Okay. ﻿So what is your idea? ﻿Sorry. ﻿It's okay. I can understand. ﻿Take some time. ﻿Nobody knows what really happened.

Coffee for her and tea for me. Perspectives. What's true? Who is right? ﻿Everything changes when you see it from a different point of view. ﻿So how am I supposed to come to a conclusion? ﻿tell this story with a conclusion. ﻿Instead, ﻿lf every aspect and each perspective of the story is narrated, ﻿the readers might find their own answers. ﻿Hmmm... ﻿Fair enough. ﻿Ho many articles do you want to write? ﻿I don't know.

What happened? ﻿He was released after eight years in the remand home. ﻿He returned to Malpe. ﻿And looked for Raghu all over in vain. ﻿But Raghu was nowhere to be found. ﻿Then how did you find Raghu's whereabouts? ﻿I didn't know either, until I visited Bombay. ﻿I was in Bombay to show cashew nut samples to a buyer. ﻿He exports cashews to foreign countries. ﻿Raghu was his acquaintance. ﻿We visited a ladies bar for dinner one night and Raghu joined us there. ﻿What did he do in Bombay? ﻿He was only 13 or 14 years old when he fled to Bombay. ﻿He took up a job in a little canteen at the Bombay port. ﻿A few years later he became the cashier as he was good with numbers. A few years later he became the cashier as he was good with numbers. ﻿Gradually, he got involved in smalltime smuggling at the Bombay port. ﻿Then one day, he made a mess, cracking the head of someone from the Navy. ﻿He died on the spot! ﻿Raghu had to take refuge with another gang. ﻿He couldn't get out of the vicious circle. ﻿So didn't he feel like returning home in these 15 years? ﻿He would've never come back. He had only bad memories of here. ﻿Not that he had good memories in Bombay. ﻿But how many times can a man run away from his memories? ﻿No, no! I'm not expecting any money out of this. ﻿I'm just making notes. What was the name of the ladies bar in Bombay? ﻿I'm a regular to quite a few ladies bars. It's hard to recall out of the blue. ﻿It's... mm... ﻿It's... Hmmmm... Roopa Ladies Bar. ﻿So when did you meet him? ﻿Almost a year ago. ﻿We spoke a lot that night. I told him about his father's death. ﻿He was very upset. ﻿He asked me to meet him the next day early in the morning at the Bombay harbor. ﻿Chapter 1 Voice of Silence. ﻿When did this happen? ﻿Four years ago. Liver cancer. ﻿His drinking worsened after you ran away. ﻿Mother? ﻿She is okay. Haven't seen her for a long time now. ﻿I see her once in a while when visit the market to buy fish. ﻿Is she happy? ﻿I don't know. ﻿She is alone. How can she be happy? ﻿Why don't you come back? ﻿Where? To Malpe? And do what? ﻿You could set up a business. ﻿It's not that easy. They'll come for me if I leave Bombay. ﻿Who? ﻿The people I work for. ﻿I know their secrets. They won't like me quitting. ﻿Why don't you get her here then? ﻿To this hellhole? She must've learned to live without me by now. So let it be. How are others? ﻿Others? Richi ﻿You remember Shankar Poojary, don't you? ﻿Richi oversees his legal and illegal business. ﻿Still a bully. ﻿Even after serving time in the remand home. After you fled, he was sent to remand home for eight years. ﻿Take this money. ﻿What is this for? Keep it. Meet my mother frequently. ﻿Let me know if she needs money. I'll send in more. ﻿And don't tell anyone about meeting me. ﻿I didn't hear from him for a while. ﻿He then called me two weeks before this incident. ﻿He wanted to flee from the country along with his mother forever. ﻿He assured to call back after arranging money. ﻿Hello. ﻿I'm coming to Malpe. ﻿Arrange my accommodation. ﻿Nobody should know about my visit. ﻿The money is arranged. ﻿A huge deal between the Bombay underworld and the US mafia was underway. ﻿A red bag crucial for the deal went missing two days prior. ﻿I had no choice but to steal the bag. ﻿But they won't spare me. ﻿They will try and find me. ﻿I don't know where the switch is. We visit so rarely. ﻿It's not a big house. But it's safe. ﻿There is some food in the kitchen. Some bread, jam and eggs. ﻿Can you cook? ﻿Will she come with me? ﻿Of course, She will. ﻿What if she refuses? ﻿What is wrong with you? How will she say no to her only son? ﻿Mark my words, She will be ecstatic to see you. ﻿Hmmm. ﻿Well in that case I'll need your help with her passport. ﻿It will take a month or two. I can't stay here much longer. Don't worry about all that. I'll take care of it. ﻿Keep this money. ﻿I'll send more from Dubai. ﻿Do you have a passport? ﻿Yes! ﻿I've had my share of Dubai dreams. ﻿Okay then, I'll make arrangements on reaching Dubai. ﻿I'll send tickets for the both of you after mom's passport is done. ﻿You'll have to accompany her to Dubai. ﻿To Dubai? Will I get a job there? I have friends in Dubai. I'll talk to them. ﻿Alright. I'll go now. ﻿Get ready by 8 pm. ♫ ﻿If you need anything give me a call. ♫ ♫ The phone is right there. ♫ ♫ ﻿Hide and seek, ♫ ♫ Away from the womb. ♫ ♫ ﻿You went beyond the light. ♫ ♫ ﻿How high into the sky have you flown? ♫ ♫ ﻿That you cannot see your own mother. ♫ ♫ ﻿Fingers have dried, ♫ ♫ ﻿Holding the food you've forgotten. ♫ ♫ ﻿I am worn out waiting. ♫ ﻿I called him at 8 pm to tell that the car was waiting. ﻿He was nervous, perhaps because he was seeing his mother after years. ♫ ﻿A full grown tree is ♫ ♫ eager to see its roots. ♫ ♫ ﻿A bird of the vast skies ♫ ♫ yearns for its mother's nest. ♫ ♫ ﻿If you trace the baby steps, ♫ ♫ ﻿I can come home again. ♫ ♫ ﻿I wish to go back into your womb, ♫ ♫ ﻿To be born again with painless labour. ♫ ♫ ﻿The mother's eyes are always Seeking. ♫ ♫ ﻿Hearing the child's call, ♫ ♫ ﻿I came running. ♫ ♫ ﻿Oh my Mother! ♫ ﻿After visiting his mother, he called me around midnight... when he was back at the farmhouse. ﻿He was overjoyed. ﻿His mother had agreed to come. ﻿He wanted the car again at 7 pm the next day. ﻿His mother had called him for dinner. ﻿I called him the next afternoon. ﻿We talked for a bit. ﻿He said that he heard a car arrive. ﻿Gimme a minute. I hear a car outside. ﻿They are coming. ﻿Did you tell anyone about me? ﻿No. I didn't tell anyone. ﻿How did they know? ﻿I think I saw a gun. ﻿I'll call back. ﻿Please connect a trunk call to Dubai. ﻿Operator: Telephone number Sir. ﻿Seven five eight double zero. ﻿Operator: Okay, I'll call back in 5 minutes. ﻿I visited the farmhouse he stayed at. ﻿I could feel his presence there. I could feel what he felt. I experienced his confusion. ﻿I sensed a chapter coming to an end. ﻿The next chapter was in the making. Tearing the poster, Out came the hero. Your attention please! As the Cuban kid always said Here we meet once again! Chapter 2 Richard Anthony Alias Richi. ﻿What can I say? ﻿I lost a brother. ﻿Richi was like a son to me. ﻿B@$tarD! He is an A$$h0lE, a $ON OF A BitcA! He should rot in hell! ﻿There is a story about him. ﻿When Richi was in the remand home there was a ruthless cop who beat up the kids. ﻿On his way out of the remand home, Richi stole his uniform. ﻿And wore that police belt everywhere he went around town. ﻿Can you believe that? What a waste! Thank you! What a risk! Old customs of the past, sacred land, sacred house God will forgive anyone who sins in that house, but the householder will never forgive. Smiles! ﻿I know all about Shankar Poojary. ﻿He may be an important man to these guys. ﻿It's all black money. ﻿They say he ruled the Bombay underworld at one time. ﻿Bullshit! ﻿Then why did he flee from Bombay? ﻿They kicked him out. ﻿He can't even set foot in Bombay anymore. ﻿He is an exile. ﻿Please find that god forsaken picture, will you? ﻿I've told a million times that it is a dummy camera. ﻿You don't believe my words. ﻿What are you laughing at? ﻿Do I look crazy? ﻿You guys are crazy! ﻿- Have you seen yourselves... - Shut up! ﻿You were saying something interesting.

That is my business. Richi, I'm talking about Mr. Gonsalves’ son. ﻿Mr. Gonualvas came to church yesterday.

Don't you hear my devout pleas? Tearing the poster, Out came the hero. Your attention please! As the Cuban kid always said Here we meet once again! Hey, hey, hey, hey hey! Down, down, down, down. Now vou may ask me, Who is this Cuban kid? ﻿Well, There is a little story behind it. When I was in the Bombay remand home, There was this legend. The legend of two kids. ﻿A long time ago, A story about two kids in the remand home. Some called it a myth. ﻿And people like me, believed it to be a true incident. Hmmm, the telephone rings a lot here. ﻿Don't worry. I will take care of it. ﻿Back to the story. ﻿The two kids. One was from Cuba, ﻿The other kid, ﻿He was from a village called Mandva somewhere in Maharashtra. ﻿Uh oh! ﻿What the hell! ﻿Easy man! ﻿No tension. ﻿He is our friend. ﻿Where was I? Yes. ﻿The two kids. Antonio Montano, What was the other one's name? ﻿Vijay. ﻿Yes Vijay Dinanath Chauhan. ﻿Wanna smoke? ﻿Okay! ﻿Every morning in the remand home, ﻿Everyone gathered at this canteen for breakfast. ﻿Whenever this Cuban kid saw the kid from Mandva, ﻿He smiled and abused him in Spanish. ﻿The Mandva kid never understood a word. ﻿But it happened again... And again... And again. ﻿Now tell me, If you were in his shoes, how long would you bear it? ﻿Then one day, the Mandva kid lost his mind, put the Cuban kid on the ground and started punching him. ﻿Daan! Daan! Daan! ﻿Punched until he broke the nose open. ﻿Will you keep staring at us or make yourself useful and go search? ﻿So... ﻿The two kids were taken to the warden and the Mandva kid was asked to explain, ﻿Why he beat him up? ﻿The Mandva kid explained what happened. ﻿The warden then asked the Cuban kid, why he swore at him? ﻿The Cuban kid abused again in front of the warden. ﻿But this time, ﻿Not with a smiling face though. ﻿But with a broken nose. ﻿Concentrate! ﻿Now this is the best part. ﻿The warden then realized that the Cuban kid was only greeting the Mandva kid. ﻿Good Morning! We meet once again! ﻿It is a Cuban tradition. ﻿The Mandva kid was embarrassed. Then they became best of friends. ﻿That's the legend. But that's not the point. ﻿My point is, ﻿Let's rewind to the part where the Cuban kid is getting punched. ﻿At that moment, What is running through the Cuban kid's mind? ﻿Put yourself in his shoes. ﻿You are getting punched by a kid, But you have no clue why he is hitting you. ﻿What would be going on in your mind? ﻿Full confusion, right? ﻿Are you confused? ﻿You have a bag. If you don't hand it over, I'm gonna shoot you. ﻿I don't have any bag. ﻿You do. If you don't give it, I'm gonna take it anyway, along with your life. ﻿I'm telling the truth. There is no bag. ﻿ls it? Okay. ﻿We'll find the bag. And then we'll shoot you. ﻿Got it. ﻿Good! ﻿Now it's time to shoot you. ﻿But the bag is empty. ﻿Huh? Empty? There must be something. ﻿Have you brought an empty bag? ﻿Alright. ﻿We'll have a look in the bag once we shoot you. ﻿Now, I'll shoot you. ﻿Before I shoot you, ﻿Why was I telling you the story of those kids? ﻿You don't know? ﻿How did it start? ﻿Come on. Don't spoil it now. ﻿What did I say when I entered through that door? ﻿Your attention please. ﻿After that? ﻿Tell me fast! ﻿Are you on mute? ﻿What did I say after that? ﻿We meet once again. ﻿What does it mean? ﻿We meet once again. ﻿Exactly! You B@$rarD! We meet once again. ﻿We meet once again after 15 years! ﻿Richi? ﻿Oh! So you remember Richi! ﻿You B@$tarD, $On OF A BitcA! ﻿Look at your face. It's a sight to watch. ﻿Look at his face. Sweating like a pig. ﻿So you remember Richi? ﻿How can I forget you? ﻿What? You $0n OF A BitcA! ﻿You've returned to Udupt after 15 years. Why didn't you let your best friend know about it? ﻿It's not like that. I was supposed to meet you all. ﻿But... So I heard you met your mother last night. ﻿Oh, you know? ﻿Are you taking her to Dubai? Won't you take me along? ﻿Alright. ﻿Take your bag. You are coming with us. ﻿Sorry. I've promised mom that I'll be coming home for dinner. ﻿Fine. I'll drop you home by evening. Now come on. ﻿Come on now. ﻿Get him along. ﻿I'm sorry about breaking the door. ﻿I have a small job to do. If you don't mind You enjoy the sea breeze. I will finish my job. ﻿Hey Sudhi! Stop the boat. ﻿Hey A$$h0l3! So you want Shankaranna's money, eh? ﻿So you're a tiger, eh? ﻿When a dog gets high it eats its own shit. ﻿Deceitful B@$tarD! ﻿Are you a real tiger? Let me hear you roar like a tiger. Don't whine like a dog. Tiger! Roar like a tiger. Louder! I cant hear you. Roar properly you $On OF A BitcA! Nah! It's not a real tiger.

Bloody crow! All this mess is because of you! ﻿You are the main reason. I'm gonna kill you today! You B@$TarD! Disgusting crow! ﻿Hey! What are you doing? She is a girl. How willl you say no to her? ﻿She is just asking for an interview. Talk to her. ﻿Hey Koraga, Mind your own business. ﻿If you so wanna talk to her, go give the interview. ﻿Don't tell me what to do. ﻿﻿Come on! Leave me!

I'll talk. ﻿Do you see that crow? ﻿That B@$tarD crow! ﻿It's been following me since I got that thing. ﻿What thing? ﻿What is it? ﻿Shhhh! ﻿You shouldn't take its name. ﻿It is a bad omen, a curse. ﻿It has ruined all its owners’ lives. ﻿I found it while fishing at the sea. ﻿What does it look like? ﻿It was raining heavily that night. ﻿Five people could not pull the net that day. I joined and so did Seena. It took seven people to haul the net. ﻿As we untied the net, we found a huge log of wood in the midst of the fish. ﻿For some reason, I couldn't discard it. ﻿I got it home along with me. ﻿That night the bird was crowing non stop. It sounded like a brass band inside my ears. ﻿shoo! Shoo! Go away. Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! ﻿Hey! Go away. Shoo! Shoo! ﻿The crow did not leave with all my efforts. I realized the crow had followed me from the sea. ﻿It did not stop crowing. It had its eyes fixed on the piece of wood. ﻿I couldn't bear it anymore and threw the log towards the crow. ﻿The log split and I see the most beautiful thing in my life! ﻿Gold. It shined as bright as gold! ﻿It is very precious. ﻿It's in huge demand outside our own country too. ﻿Do you know how much they were ready to pay? ﻿In lakhs, crores. ﻿You can't imagine. So much money. ﻿It's a relic. You won't find it anywhere but in the depths of the ocean. ﻿So where is it now? ﻿I sold it to a guy in Bombay. ﻿That B@$tarD gave me an advance of 10,000 and promised me to pay 50% of profit after sale. ﻿But then he calls me and says that it is stolen. ﻿Now how does that matter to me? ﻿Catch the culprit. ﻿Give me my money. ﻿He says he can't until he finds that thing. ﻿Now you tell me, ﻿How do I trust these guys with so much money? ﻿Shankar Poojary was after it too. ﻿He had sent that Richi, to find out where I had sent it in Bombay. ﻿But Shankar Poojary told me that... ﻿I was selling his fish in the market. ﻿$On OF A BitcA! ﻿Runs an illegal business and talks about righteousness. ﻿This Shankar Poojary has good links in Bombay. ﻿You just can't trust him with anything. ﻿This bloody crow doesn't stop. I'm going to kill it today. ﻿Chapter 5 Ka. ﻿Trust me. ﻿We don't give Bechappas (scarecrow) their real credits. ﻿Bechappa has protected our field day and night from crows and even animals. ﻿What have we done in return? Not even a yakshagana act in his name. If you ask me, ﻿We should perform a Yakshagana act in his name. ﻿The Chronicles of Bechappa. What do you think, huh? There is an act on Krishna & Arjuna's battle. ﻿Bheeshma's Victory too. ﻿Has Krishna, Arjuna or Bheeshma ever saved us from the crow. Never! why on earth should we have acts in their names? But Bechappa has always been there for us. ﻿What do you folks call him? ﻿Bedaru Gombe. ﻿Not bad. ﻿Same looks but different names. ﻿Hey Balu! ﻿Come on. Let's paint you waist down. ﻿In a minute. Don't get on my nerves now. Paint the rest of them. ﻿Everyone's almost finished. You come fast. ﻿Bedaru Gombe ﻿Isn't a very ordinary name? You should have named him something strong. KrantiVeera (Revolutionary) MahaPrachanda (The Tremendous) Bedaru Gombe Doesn't have a ring to it. Trust me. ﻿You folks over at the western ghats have no sense in naming. ﻿Have you gone nuts? ﻿A scarecrow is a scarecrow. What else will you call it? ﻿Don't underestimate our Bechappa. ﻿Do you know how many sleepless nights I've had due to that bloody crow? ﻿It didn't let me sleep or a week. ﻿I tried to scare it in vain. Finally I settled down near my Saviour, Bechappa. ﻿That crow did not dare to come close to me for those 4 days. ﻿I'm telling you, These crows are really scared of Bechappa. ﻿Have a look. ﻿He is a foreigner. ﻿That's the guy who is buying it. ﻿Marsellus Wallace. ﻿A rich party! ﻿He was ready to pay in crores! ﻿Take a few more drags. ﻿Oh no! ﻿I can't handle the high. ﻿How much money is a crore? ﻿How many zeros does it have? ﻿You'll see, my Bechappa's prophecy will come true. ﻿You B@$tarD! ﻿Fantasizing about my sister in my company, huh? ﻿Tell you the truth, ﻿These folks from the Western ghats have no control over themselves. ﻿The guilty conscience does not need an accuser.

Bloody crow! ﻿You feel it is true, yet different from the other. ﻿One incident seen through different eyes. I guess, the thing was stolen by Raghu in Bombay. ﻿He probably had plans to sell it in Dubai and settle there. ﻿I told you! Its a bad omen, a curse. It won't rest until it ruins your life. ﻿Perspectives. What's right? What's wrong? What is the truth? Which one is a lie? ﻿Everything changes when you see it from a different point of view. ﻿No, no! Richi didn't kill him. I was there. They were childhood friends. Why would he kill him? So why didn't Raghu meet his mother that night? ﻿I'm not sure either. When we were leaving the farmhouse, he said he had to make an urgent trunk call. ﻿After the phone call, he was tensed. He left in the evening to meet his mother. ﻿I don't know what happened after that. ﻿He must've returned secretly, probably because, the Bombay guys found out he was here. ﻿If he is in Dubai, he will surely call me. So how am I supposed to come to a conclusion? ﻿In fact, it would be wrong to tell this story with a conclusion. ﻿Instead, If every aspect and each perspective of the story is narrated, ﻿I believe you'll find your own answers. ﻿I did not witness this story. I've chronicled it “As Seen by the Rest"
