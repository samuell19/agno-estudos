I mean, I drank too much. Well, yeah, I hadn't seen anybody for a really long time, you know, so it was a lot of hi, how are you, what have you been up to, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, I kind of remembered people, I don't know. I'm talking quietly because I'm really hungover and loud sounds hurt my head. Oh, come on, you've got three hours on me. This hardly seems fair. No, no, I gotta, I gotta go. I'm sorry, I need more sleep, okay? Yeah, yeah, I'll talk to you later, mmm hmm. (GENTLE MUSIC) I love you too. Bye. (GROANS) (DARREL SIGHS) (WATER SPLASHING) A medical drama, right. What is this? Yeah. (TOY LAUGHING) (COMICAL MUSIC) Hey, checking the time. You got an early flight? Ah, you know, I got a little time. (SIGHS) But, you know, yeah, we can, I can head out if you're busy. I just, I have a long shoot tonight, - you know, so I should - Yeah, yeah. - probably go back to sleep. - No problem. (SIGHS) I'm sorry, I can't find my phone. Did you leave it in the Lyft? No. I don't think so. SYDNEY: Are you sure? DARREL: Can you call it please? Can you call it please, Syd? Will you hand me my phone? What's your number? Oh never mind, I got it. It goes straight to voicemail. Yeah, I might've left it in the car. Did I call it or did you? I did. Can you check, please, see if I left it? The faster you help me find this, the faster I can get outta here. You're fine. Thank you. Okay. DARREL: What? We have to wait for him to get back to us. Uh, should I wait upstairs? Could I wait down here? I'm going to sleep. I have to work tonight. You can stay if you want. You didn't have a good time last night? No, no, I had expectations, I guess. (GENTLE MUSIC) DARREL: Well, so did I. Did I somehow not meet them? When we worked together, you were, you know, much more pleasant. (CHUCKLES) We were flirting and you didn't really know me back then and you definitely don't know me now. That's fair, I don't know you. So, tell me something, anything, about you (CHUCKLES). Like what? Like where you're from. I told you where I'm from. Ask me something better. (CHUCKLES) All right, how 'bout (CLEARS THROAT) what is the most interesting place that you've ever had sex, like in public or something? In front of people? Yeah, or like, you know, like the woods. Well, all the working girls have had sex in the woods. It's like a coming of age thing here. Oh, that's so primitive. (BOTH LAUGHING) Hey, you know, since we're stuck here, you know, figured I'd just throw this out there. I know I could've been, you know, a little more generous last night, you know. Yeah. So, how do you want me to? What? You know, want me to take care of you. You know, lick the cat, paint the wall, unpack the box. Oh, my God! What, shut the fuck up. Oh, but I don't get second chances now? SYDNEY: No. (DARREL SIGHS) - Lick the cat? - I'm sorry. What are you even... I just, I didn't think you'd actually be offended - by that. - I'm making coffee, do you want some? Sure. (SIGHS) You're a guy. I resent statements like that. Like what? To assume that I'm just driven uncontrollably by sex. I bet you think that every dude who talks to you is hitting on you, even when he says simple shit like good morning. No, but I do think many guys under most circumstances would have sex with most women. And you think we can help that. Yeah, I think you can. (SIGHS) Let's drop that. I've got a question for you. In your movie, Yeah. why did you decide on the ending? How do you mean? Well, life isn't like that. I don't think that there's just one special person out there for us. Yeah, it's a nice thought, though, isn't it? I don't think it is such a nice thought really. I mean there's so many people in the universe. It's sad to think that we each can connect with only one. So you didn't like the movie. SYDNEY: No, I told you I did. And you weren't just telling me what you thought I wanted to hear? Wow, I didn't know you were so insecure. And you're not. Mmm, no, my mom raised me to be a little too confident. And your dad? SYDNEY: He didn't raise me. Yep (LAUGHS). - Don't... - All the signs - are there, Sydney. - Not all girls who come from broken homes have daddy issues, okay? Well yes, come on that's not what I meant. Uh look, I'm gonna have to chalk this phone up to a loss if they don't get back to you soon. Still nothing. Why do you look so upset? I'm all right. Right, well, I'm sorry. I just had a really big crush on you when we were shooting and I was just hoping it would be, you know? All right. No, what was so bad about it? You, uh, jammed your dick in my mouth until you got hard and then you couldn't keep it up long enough to have sex. Wow, well, thank you for holding back. I'm sorry. Mmm hmm, and you farted in your sleep. I did that while I was awake. Don't laugh. That's not funny. I apologize for being a human being. You snore and you grind your teeth. Well, I don't wear my mouth guard when men sleep over. Sydney, I'm a good lover. Wouldn't know it. So I used to be, huh? Oh God, ugh. What? (SIGHS) Stop saying lover! And stop being so serious, all right? Nobody's gonna wanna fuck the sad guy. Good talk, Sydney. Dude, where are you going? DARREL: Upstairs. Well, what about your phone? Look if you're gonna stay then yes, I want you to. To what? To take care of me. (CHUCKLES) (GENTLE MUSIC) You know you're fucking crazy, right? SYDNEY: Mmm hmm. Are you a Gemini? SYDNEY: No. DARREL: There we go. (SYDNEY SIGHS) Don't laugh at me. I'm always laughing at you. Stop laughing at me. Well, stop being goofy. I can't. DARREL: Mmm. SYDNEY: Mmm. Hmm. DARREL: Hmm? SYDNEY: Mmm. Uh oh. - Uh. - Oh well. Yeah. Sorry. Don't apologize. Yeah, I'm not really sorry. I know. Rule number one in my bed, you have to be honest. Brutally honest, even. Mmm hmm. (DARREL CHUCKLES) (GENTLE MUSIC) I'm clean, by the way. Good. Are you? You'll find out in two weeks. See, that's not funny. You know, shouldn't we have had this conversation before? DARREL: Yes, I usually do, but you know, last night was kind of spontaneous, I guess. Hmm. Well, in my book if you don't ask, then you deserve to worry a little. That's so evil. What is wrong with you? (CHUCKLES) When was the last time you were tested? (MUMBLES) It's been awhile. But it's fine 'cause you know, everybody else I've been sleeping with gets tested regularly so we're good. Well, that's fucking stupid. Syd, relax, I'm playing, I'm fine. I don't have anything. All right, I don't, you know, I don't even have sex very often. SYDNEY: When was the last time? DARREL: It's been months. You need to have sex more often. Oh, okay, well I'll sign up for it, just check it out. No, seriously. Like I remember how wound up you used to be, you know. You were always so intense. I guess, you know, like to think I'm kinda funny, too. Mmm. When? Syd, I say funny things all the time. You wore glasses when we worked together. Is that all you remember? I don't know. I remember, uh, you were a hard worker. Yeah. Oh, I remember that you used to walk around the set barefoot all the time. And that you had a toe ring. And that you had pretty cute feet. (CHUCKLES) Why, you have a foot thing? (GENTLE MUSIC) (BOTH LAUGHING) You do. DARREL: Oh, it's embarrassing. No, it's okay. DARREL: Oh, this is embarrassing. Do you wanna touch mine? DARREL: Oh my God, Syd, stop. - Syd, what is wrong with you? - Oh you do. Ba bum, bum, bum. DARREL: Syd. You can kiss 'em if you want. Nobody ever lets me do this. SYDNEY: Well, why not? (PHONE BLEEPS) I don't know. Guess I don't go around telling people that I like feet. I feel so silly (GIGGLES). Why? Why didn't we ever do this before? We didn't know we could. Do they smell? - Mmmm (LAUGHS). - Oh! No, come here, I don't mind. - No, I do. - I don't mind 'em. SYDNEY: Uh. (PHONE BLEEPS) Oh. Not the car? Nope. You're popular today. I have to go to work soon-ish. Already? Wanna hear something honest? SYDNEY: Yeah. I thought about you a lot over the years. SYDNEY: What did you think? I don't know, what you were doing, what your life was like. I work in reality TV now. Reality. Well, I don't like scripted. DARREL: Sydney. I like writing. I just don't like scripted. We had no budget, no time, no time. And we made a great film with $3,000. No, no, no, you belong in scripted. We need to work together again, too. - Huh! - Yeah. Reality is just so... SYDNEY: Reality is not what's wrong with America. I wasn't gonna say that. I'm getting out of it anyway. TV? Film, everything. I'm kinda done. Why? Because I work all the time and I don't have benefits. You know, it just, I'm realizing I don't wanna do this for the rest of my life. So you're really not passionate about this anymore, huh? I didn't say that. And passion doesn't go away. It just, it moves around a little and you just have to find it again. Can I ask you a question? SYDNEY: Yeah. And, you know, just I'm gonna throw this out, I might sound like a 16-year-old girl and I'm okay with that (CHUCKLES), did you unfriend me on Facebook after the movie wrapped? SYDNEY: Oh shit. Ah, mmm, nope I noticed. 'Cuz I looked for you specifically and all I could see was your profile picture. (SIGHS) Are you gonna ask me why? The wrap party? I knew you had a crush on me and I obviously had a crush on you. But I knew you were with someone. So when we kissed, everything got a little too real for me. You know, just one second I went away to get beers and I came back and you were gone. Sorry. Nah, that's okay. I guess it's funny now, ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah, it never woulda worked out anyway. You know, workplace romance and all. Yeah, totally unprofessional (CHUCKLES). Mmm hmm. Are you seeing someone right now? Uh. I just, you know, got out of a thing. I guess it's a break up. How 'bout you? Any recent break ups? Not really. This is the honesty bed, isn't it? SYDNEY: Mmm hmm, yeah. (DARREL CHUCKLES) (GENTLE MUSIC) DARREL: Do you like me, Sydney? Don't take advantage of rule number one, okay? Okay. And also does this work for you? Telling everybody everything, every emotional current that runs through your mind just blah. I think people need to say what's on their mind. Huh. Sydney, it doesn't bother you that we're just wandering around on a blue ball floating in the middle of the universe and nobody is talking about it? That shit is crazy. (LAUGHS) Right? Like here we are sitting in a bed together, not doing anything about it. Nope. But I know that I want to be in this bed with you all day. This will probably never happen again. You don't know that. Mmm, this is how we are. You know, we find these tiny little grooves, we make these connections. And then we meet someone else. We just bounce around meeting people, some good, some bad, some weird. Until we find another groove and make another connection. But some, some of these moments, these connections, these grooves, they need to be longer so that we can remember them clearer, better. You're real deep, huh? All right, stop. No, I, I don't know if there's serendipity or poetry in everything, you know. I just think things happen the way they do and not always the way they're supposed to. I know that I want to be here with you, here, as long as I possibly can. But we smell like alcohol and my vagina. And my breath is awful. - It is. - Ugh. That's very true. That is not a lie at all. See. My breath is bad too. I don't even have a toothbrush and it's a first world problem but it's a problem. I mean, we should definitely stay in touch. (LAUGHS) Don't look at me like that. (SIGHS) Uh. I wanna kiss you. Are you trying to get sex from me before you go? Sit down over there. You're perfect. (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) (SYDNEY MOANS) Let's come at the same time. Can I come on your face? No. Sorry. (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) I'm getting close. (DARREL MOANING) (SYDNEY SIGHS) You want a towel. No, it's okay. Come here. (GENTLE MUSIC) If we're gonna stay in bed all day, I've got another rule. DARREL: What's that? Rule number two, you can't wear pants. I'm not wearing pants, so deal. Rule number three, no leaving the bed. ♪ Turn it down ♪ Shake on it. ♪ Turn it down ♪ (SYDNEY GIGGLES) ♪ Turn it down ♪ ♪ Now now ♪ ♪ Turn it down ♪ ♪ Turn it ♪ ♪ Turn it down ♪ ♪ Now now ♪ (UPBEAT MUSIC) (TRAIN WHISTLE TOOTING) (TRAIN BELL RINGING) (TRAIN WHISTLE TOOTING) (BOTH LAUGHING) DARREL: Oh, mine looks like a paper labia. Can you show me again? SYDNEY: You're so close. Come on, you already, you just gotta... DARREL: No, just gotta flip it under then. Okay, what did you do? I don't know. Oh, no, it's really close. Just fold that under. Okay. - That's the head. - Yeah. Mmm hmm, you're close, you're close. - Keep going. - Well, I think, I think you kinda... - I don't understand. - Just fold it. Does the director really need a thousand of these just because? He said he wanted a thousand folded paper cranes behind the talking head of this interview just because. Why do you have to it? You all don't have PAs? Yeah, but everybody bailed. I'm only doing a hundred. Yes, 'cause a thousand is overkill. Hold on, hold on. I mean, the wings are low, but, but, but. - You finished one! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I did! - Yes! - Okay that was weird action. - I don't know why. Throw it, throw it. - Yay! - Woo! Boom, all right, do another one. I'm gonna, oh, okay, I think I'm gonna hit that after intermission. (BOTH LAUGHING) You like living here? Yeah, I do actually. DARREL: Where would you live, you know, if you didn't live in Portland? (SIGHS) New Orleans, - Atlanta, New York. - Yuck. Los Angeles, it's where it's at. Just shake the overcast. No, I don't really mind it, but I do like the beach and the sun, don't you? Mmm, I don't need it. Mmm, I do need food, though. Oh, we should eat something. We made a pact to not leave the bed. But I'm hungry. Yeah, you're right, you're right. Ba food. Yeah. Ah. (CHUCKLES) Floor clause. Floor clause. DARREL: Yep, second it so we can pass. - You pass, all right, cool. - I second the floor clause. DARREL: You're damn right you do. Oh, what are you doing? DARREL: You second that fucking floor clause. - That's right. - Oh no. Oh God, don't, don't do that. Sit there and be the wind. I saw this in a movie once. What are you doing? Genius. I'm a fucking genius. What the fuck amazing - is what I'm being. - Oh my God. Please don't hurt yourself. I'm not gonna hurt myself. Oh, God, here we go. That's right, take it all in, sweetheart, - take it all in. - Oh my God! (BOTH LAUGHING) DARREL: They should make this shit an Olympic event. - Oh, don't hurt yourself. - Ah, here we go. SYDNEY: There's a step. DARREL: Yeah, I see, I see the step in your split level studio. (LAUGHS) Whose idea was that? It makes it look it bigger. DARREL: Because that makes a lot of fucking sense. Here we go. I have kale chips. Fuck gonna do with kale chips? Did you ever fucking go grocery shopping? No, I actually don't. You've got tangerines and a Keurig so that's where we are. (SYDNEY LAUGHS) Uh, how's grits sound? SYDNEY: Grits. - I like grits. - Great, 'cause that's the only thing in your kitchen. Grits are delicious. Yeah, apparently so are kale chips. And that's just weird. (SYDNEY LAUGHS) Okay. I gotta say, I really like this view. You got a dirty bowl, come clean out your sink. (SYDNEY LAUGHS) My back. Oh, man. I need to take a picture of you. DARREL: You don't need to take a picture honestly. Just asked you. Oh, oh. Not the first time you've seen an ass before. Oh, I wish it was just the ass I was seeing. DARREL: I'm winded, that's for damn sure. You see that damn much. (SYDNEY GIGGLES) SYDNEY: Well, you're working pretty hard. DARREL: I'm working pretty hard. SYDNEY: Okay, well, it should be good. DARREL: It should be good. Fine, I'm gonna take it out. If they're lukewarm grits I don't wanna hear shit about it. You're gonna burn something and it's - not gonna be pleasant. - Not gonna burn something. It'll be all right. You know how much it costs to get a six-foot black dude with grits delivered to your bed? What the fuck? SYDNEY: Probably in the thousands. Why do you have so many rugs in your house? I thank you for your help. You wanna get you a couple chairs and come over here and help me. No, all right, no. - That's fine. - No, I think I'm good. - No, it's cool - I don't like - what you're doing. - It's cool. - I'm gonna stay over here. - Your bra's still on it. What's the nearest hospital in case I actually do almost die? I don't know. - All right, well... - It's 911. It's all the same number. All right, well you dial 'cause you're white. (SYDNEY LAUGHS) - I'm fine. - Oh! DARREL: Can you not, show a little confidence. - Okay. - You're low and I'm not falling off a fucking building. - You're good. - Don't be so dramatic. - Can I, can I help you? - Stop these things. Oh, now you wanna help. I just crawled across your floor with butt ass naked on a chair and now you wanna help me. This is why we can't have nice things. - Be careful. - You ready? - Yeah. - You be careful now. I'm back now, move, so you can see, move. Ready? Oh yeah, uh! (SYDNEY LAUGHS) Yep, like a graceful fucking swan. - Wow! - That was impressive, right? That was amazing. You're goddamn right it was. That was one of the coolest things I think I've ever seen in my life. DARREL: Oh, that's 'cause you live in Portland. (BOTH LAUGHING) You know you need to stop being so rude about Portland. - I know. - Portland is actually pretty awesome. I see, I see. Hold on I'm gonna fix your pillows - like Martha fucking Stewart. - Thank you. (SYDNEY LAUGHS) Okay. SYDNEY: Mmm. It's so good. I make movies. I can tell when you're lying. (SYDNEY LAUGHS) - Mmm, it's good. - Yeah. It's like instant regret. (SYDNEY LAUGHS) Yep. We'll put that over there. DARREL: Come here. Great kiss. Mmm, that's (CHUCKLES)... I never thought this would happen. And yet here we are. (BOTH SIGH) You know, we hardly know each other. DARREL: I don't feel that. No? Well, I did push back work for you. DARREL: You did. Well, you didn't have to, I thank you. Yeah, they'll call me when they need me. Hey, you think we would've been friends like in school? SYDNEY: You're way too nice. I'm not that nice once you get to know me. SYDNEY: You're too sensitive. Too sensitive? Okay. I just hung out with bitchy girls and we made fun of people. Yeah. I don't know if you and I would've been friends. You know, I went through phases and stuff, like a rebellious phase. Hmm, rebellious how? I'd sneak out and smoke pot. Oh! (GIGGLES) Oh, nothing wildly original. But my dad had a camera and I'd go on long walks and make movies. Studied at NYU, right? That is intimidating (LAUGHS). SYDNEY: Well you didn't go to Tisch and you turned out fine. DARREL: Mmm. You know, I think you're more confident than you think you are. Thanks? (BOTH CHUCKLE) Your parents, are they still together? Oh, yeah. There are no divorces in the Graham family. SYDNEY: Yeah, but should there be? They annoy the fuck out of each other, but they stay together. It's a lost art. Do you want that? I want to not go on so many first dates. You know, I get tired of giving the same information about myself to different people. Gets old. Yeah. Yeah, I don't, I don't really think people wanna settle down anymore though, you know. There's too may options. Hmm, enough to keep you busy for a lifetime. A lifetime of swiping left and right. I don't think people know how to be happy anymore. Well, are you happy? I don't know. I don't think so. Well, why not? You can't just ask someone why they're not happy, Sydney. (CHUCKLES) You know, it's, it's a variety of factors. SYDNEY: Mmm. Well, name one. (CHUCKLES) Just one? (CHUCKLES) For starters. For starters, um, I don't think I'm where I'm supposed to be at this age in my life. But I'm here and you then you know, you can't turn around. There's no turning back. Really too late to start over. You know those where do you see yourself in 15 to 20 years projects they make you do in middle school? Yeah, that shit's a set up. (BOTH LAUGHING) Yeah. That's just something for you to look back on be like damn I was overzealous. (BOTH LAUGHING) Why am I even explaining this to you? I think you know that I won't judge you. You won't will you? Mmm nnn. I'm sad a lot. Me too. (GENTLE MUSIC) Hey, you know, I love how creative you are. I do. You just, you go out there and you do what you do. You know, I don't have that. I'm not doing that. I envy that about you. I love how direct you are. How you can communicate, I mean, and effectively. You know, everything you feel, everything you wanna say, you know. Some people spend a lifetime not knowing what they want to say or how they feel about anything. How many movies have you made? Three. I think you're doing just fine. What makes you happy? Hmm. Days like this with people like you. You know, your face looks young. DARREL: Mmm hmm. But your hands are old-looking, like old man hands. Thank you for that. I appreciate it. (SYDNEY LAUGHS) You know what's weird? One day, we're gonna be dead. Oh God, Sydney, move. - No, seriously. - Move. Don't you think about that? Like, like I could just die right now. Sydney! Really? (SYDNEY LAUGHS) Seriously, that's where we are? Stop saying words. Have you ever thought about your funeral? No. How would you like to die? And don't say in your sleep. And remember this is the honesty bed. I would go to the nearest interstate and find an overpass or to the 30th, to the 35th floor of a downtown office building because anything over 35 is overkill. And I would jump. And I would do it early morning, mid-morning, or early afternoon around that time when it's you know, really busy and everybody's trying to get somewhere. That sends a message. That guy is, he's got something to say. You know. And it's right there for the world to see. You've really thought about that. I've thought about it recently. Well, why were you thinking about that recently? It's a lot sometimes, Sydney. You know, sometimes, (SIGHS) sometimes it's too much. (SIGHS) I wouldn't, I wouldn't go through with it, though. My family wouldn't survive. The world would miss you. You know you, you have this innocent quality, people wanna take care of you. (SIGHS) I took a bunch of pills once. DARREL: When? SYDNEY: A long time ago. Why, Sydney? I was stupid, okay? And life is scary. I didn't know how to handle it. It's, I don't understand what made you do that. You really wanna know? It was a guy. (GENTLE MUSIC) Have you ever wanted somebody so bad that it consumed your whole life? On one of the biggest nights of my life all I could think about was a guy, a guy who didn't even love me back. (CHUCKLES) Oh (SIGHS). And I prayed. I don't even believe in God. It didn't work. You know. (SIGHS) You don't always walk out of a relationship having learned something. Hmm, I'm fine now. But those feelings, they wouldn't go away. There was no art in it. There's nothing to extract from it. It was just a fucking waste. Hmm. I think part of being alive is wishing you were dead. I didn't tell you this so you would feel sorry for me. I know. (PHONE BLEEPING) Oh, phone. Oh. Hey, this time it is the car. He found your phone. Oh, yeah. Well, thank God, huh? SYDNEY: Yeah. What time is your flight? Around six. Let me check. Want my phone? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh. You'll make it in plenty of time. He'll be here soon enough. Yeah. I mean, you'll have to leave soon though. Guess I should finish packing my stuff and get ready, huh? Or we could, uh, you know, we could go somewhere. Where? I mean (CHUCKLES), I don't know where. Where uh, do, would you wanna go? (SIGHS) I don't know. I don't know. Uh, hey, can I ask you a question? Yeah. Who is that in the picture with you? That's Matt, my husband. Thought so. Wait, we're separated. What, when did you ever get married? A year and a half ago. - Oh! - All right, it was fast. No shit! Well, what are you doing? Hot lava! What? It might not work out. If you've already decided that it might not work out, then why do you - even sit there... - I don't know, I don't know, okay? I can't, I can't answer that. I just, don't leave. I still... Look, I actually don't think that there are any accidents. That's stupid, Sydney. Accidents literally happen all the time. Planes crash, ships sink, cars crash... Coincidences, I know there are lots of accidents. I'm, I don't think that there are any coincidences. You were supposed to be in my bed even if it was just for today. Matt and I have been unhealthy for a really long time. We've done some messed up shit to each other. We're unhappy. (GENTLE MUSIC) We tried to do the open relationship thing because of my schedule and that didn't really work. Where would you wanna go? You said, let's go somewhere. Where would you wanna go? On a trip? Yeah. I forgot we were even talking about it. Come on. Hmm? If you wanna go, I'll go. I don't even... Come on. I don't even know where... - We could... - Where, where do you wanna go? We could go to Los Angeles. (LAUGHS) Come on, we could. We could go to the observatory. We could go to the beach. We could start a production company. Oh, wow, you're talking about, I mean. You know, we could, we could make movies. - We could figure it out. - We could operate... You know, I've been writing. I've been writing too, so. Let's go! Seriously, let's just go. What, what is holding us back? - Come on. - So you wanna go to LA and you would just wanna pitch shit to companies all day? I don't know. Yeah, whoever'll listen (CHUCKLES). DARREL: Yes? Yeah. DARREL: Yeah. Yeah. (DARREL LAUGHS) Now, this is, are you serious? Don't fuck with my, Sydney. I'll get outta here and I'm leaving and I'm not coming back. I'm not fucking with you. I'm, let's go. I'm serious, let's go. I mean, fuck, I uh... See. No, well I'm in the middle of this shoot. I can't just leave, you know. Word gets around, I'm never gonna work again. Aren't you getting out of the business anyway? Yes, yes you are. So we're gonna do it. Yeah. So let's go, give me, I need to, I gotta cancel and cancel to that (LAUGHS)... Are we really doing this? We're doing it, we're doing it. I'm gonna get us flights now. Um, okay. Ah! Okay, put this down, - we can do that later. - Yeah, I can, okay. Okay. (GENTLE MUSIC) Okay. Oh. Oh, fuck. Okay. What's happening? What's up? (GRUNTS) Yep, yep. DARREL: Can we do that? SYDNEY: I'm doing it. I have to pee so bad. I had to climb on the furniture. SYDNEY: Yeah well, you did not have to do that. Mmm. (SYDNEY GRUNTING) (DARREL CHUCKLES) Oh, yes! Oh. Hey, do you want some food? You know, like some actual food? I was serious when I said we were supposed to stay in the bed. SYDNEY: Yeah, I know, but we could get delivery. Mmm, all right. SYDNEY: Okay. Oh. Is Thai okay? Mmm, yeah, that's fine as long as it's pad thai - or red curry, that's it. - Okay. I can't believe you did this with chairs. Uh! (GIGGLES) I can't believe you did that with pillows. SYDNEY: Oh, man. Did that almost as gracefully as you. The jump's not easy, is it? (GIGGLES) That was kinda fun. DARREL: Yeah. Pad thai, red curry. Hey, that's a workout. DARREL: Yeah, now you're winded. See how it feels? (SYDNEY LAUGHS) Hello. (DARREL CHUCKLES) Yes. Hi, can I order something for delivery? I would like pad thai and red curry with chicken. Is chicken okay? Why 'cause I'm black? SYDNEY: And brown rice. You too good for white rice now? (CHUCKLES) Yes, I am at 3405 Southeast Ankeny. Card. Thank you. 'Cuz I'm black. You had to go there. You didn't have to get brown rice. I did, I like brown rice. (DARREL LAUGHS) I bet. (BOTH LAUGHING) Hey. DARREL: Yes. You had a movie come out yesterday. I did. You did. Have any reviews come out? I don't know, I don't read reviews. Why? Mmm nnn. SYDNEY: Hmm, okay. What are ya, what are you doing there? I'm lookin'. Sydney. I don't wanna hear it. SYDNEY: Okay. What if it's good. DARREL: (chuckles) Yeah, for some reason I only read the bad ones. Hmm. Okay. DARREL: Mmm. SYDNEY: Mmm. What? Nothing. What, I thought you said you didn't wanna read 'em. What that reaction, yeah, I wanna know. Okay. (CLEARS THROAT) While budgetary limitations were no doubt a factor, there's so little attempt at being cinematic that we get a rare sequence actually driven by visuals rather than dialogue. There can be a fine line between deliberately minimalist style and simple lack of technical expertise or imagination, a problem the film - struggles with throughout. - Okay. Thanks. I'm sorry. It's okay (SIGHS). Well, look, you can't take these things to heart, you know. And they can't all be bad. I'm gonna find another one here. (SIGHS) Okay, okay, here we go. DARREL: Mmm hmm. Mmm (SIGHS). Never mind. Really? Come on! (LAUGHS) Oh! This is why I don't read 'em. You know, if they knew what I went through to make it, they'd understand, right? They don't care. (PILLOW CLATTERING) (DARREL HUFFS) Who was it about? The movie. It was about somebody, wasn't it? I think it was. It was inspired by a lot of people. SYDNEY: But mostly... Yeah. SYDNEY: Do you think she'll see it? Oh God. Personally I'd be flattered if somebody made a movie about me. Really? Yeah, I mean, you know, it wouldn't make me fall in love with them or anything, but it'd be a cool story to tell my friends. God. Stop, thank you. I don't know, man, I really liked her, loved, probably. I saw the end before the beginning and I ruined it. Are you, look, I'm sorry. - I didn't mean for you... - No, I, 'cause this is different. This is, this is kinda cool. You know, I mean, you gotta try a little bit, though. You know, women like to be pursued. Well, so do I, right? I'm a sensitive guy, you know. I cry a lot. Yeah, that's 'cause you're a little bitch. Oh, you. You're gonna die alone and miserable and probably just leaving 17 cats behind. Oh yeah, why is that? Because you're a workaholic like I am. Hmm. And you're in a failed marriage. You don't know anything about my relationship. (SIGHS) DARREL: Sorry. Yeah, well. It's not untrue. God, only in love, Syd. Only in love do we actively decide to work in direct opposition of good judgment and self-care. That is crazy and I do not understand it. And that's, that is why I write love stories 'cause I am hoping that I find a way to just figure this shit out. (SYDNEY SIGHS) You know, I'm sure if she sees your movie she'll love it. You still love her, don't you? No. No, um, I would not be here in this bed with you if I did. I'm completely over it. SYDNEY: You really believe that? Yeah, yeah. There's no pressure. You can be in my bed having loved or still loving someone else. It's fine. I could love you, though. Don't say that. It's the truth, Sydney. And don't think I'm crazy for saying it. You mean, you could love me one day or that you may already? I might already love you and maybe I always did. SYDNEY: Don't throw out the word love like nothing. - Like every day... - When I say it I mean it. Well, maybe you just like saying it. Maybe it feels good to say. What are you doing up there? (SIGHS) I'm stretching my legs. (GRUNTS) Don't hit your head. (HEAD THUDS) Oh (GASPS). No, it's fine. (CHUCKLES) What did I just say. I heard, I just - didn't listen. - I just said. No, I got you. All right. All right. (GENTLE MUSIC) Could you love me, Sydney? Like love me. I don't know how to answer that. It's simple. You just say how you feel. Okay. Um, I feel I could, I don't know, I don't know. (SIGHS) I haven't had a lot of good relationships. And me either. I mean Matt, you know, he's... What is... What's he like? He is (SIGHS) tall. He's vain. He's closed off. And he always has dirt under his fingernails. I don't know how that happens. Um, he dreams big and he works hard. And he bottles things up. But he's a good man. What does he do? He's a home equity loan manager. Okay (LAUGHS). (LAUGHS) He's not boring. He's funny, he's really funny. And I like that. It's complicated. You know, you're with someone for so long and you just lose sight of... (SIGHS) I was about to finalize the divorce, but he wants to make it work. How 'bout you? We don't talk, you know, I mean, not like this. This is intimate. And his family, they're pulling for us and my mom is and it's hard. You know, I mean, it's years of my life that I've spent with this person. Well, about a year's my limit. I could do a year with you. (PHONE RINGING) Mmm. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, hello.

What made any of 'em special? Mmm, the fact that we were in the same place, right? We wanted to be in the same place, connecting with each... (CHUCKLES) I don't know. I'm sorry. What? You're not tired of me yet? Oh, no, no, no. I wanna eat you. I wanna make a vest out of your hair and drink your blood and wear your skin as a dress. Jack hammer me, Darrel, jack hammer me. It's just so much. I'm not even sure what happened to them. (BOTH LAUGHING) - Okay, all right. - No, no, no. Okay. Did you ever jack hammer what's her name? What is her name? (GROANS) Sarah.

I've got enough right up here. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I have something honest to say. (SIGHS) I came to see you, that's why I went to the premiere. Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna go. (LAUGHS) To your own premiere? But the only reason I went is 'cause I thought you might be there. I'd fantasize about you. I'd be with Matt and I would think about you. I seem to think you like me. I'm so attracted to you. When I'm around you, I, all the cells in my body wake up. I mean, they're aware, you know. My body loves your body. I fantasized about us being right here like this. And I, well, meeting your family and your friends. And buying a house, getting married, retirement, who would die first, all of it. (SYDNEY CHUCKLES) Is that weird for me to say? No, no, it's not weird. I did it too. I think the minute I really start to like somebody I kind of imagine my whole life with them, you know. I wonder if your mom would like me. Are you serious?
