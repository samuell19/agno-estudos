What if they attack the police convoy... ...and try to release Rashid? So they will get nothing. Sir, the commissioner is not sending Rashid with the convoy. That's just a decoy. And Rashid? Sir, everyone is here. They are waiting for you. The chiefs of all the three services and the police as well. What about Kumar? Has he come? - Yes, sir. He's waiting for you upstairs. - Yes. Thank you. Yes, please sit down. Please sit down. Good morning, everybody. And allow me to introduce to you, Mr. Rajesh Kumar... ...who is from our counter terrorist unit. And he is handling Rashid Omar's case. Mr. Rajesh Kumar, please begin. - Sir. Gentlemen, Rashid Omar, the mastermind... ...of an international terrorist group... They tried to get him released today morning but were unsuccessful... The leader of this group is someone called Abdullah. We don't have much information about him. But this man, Rashid, is the brain behind... ...many of the terrorist activities across the world. London, 300 people killed; Paris, suicide bombing. Bali, attack on the consonant. Really, the list is endless. Should we encounter him, if you agree? - No. It's very important to keep him alive. Through him, we have to find out what their... ...future plans are, so that we can fail them. In prison, whenever he is asked why he does all this... ...what he wants, he has just one answer. Watch this. Abdullah will tell you everything at proper time! For now, get this very clear that one day... ...we'll rule the entire universe! Today we have decided that we'll take him... ...to the Narco-analysis cell in Bangalore... ...where he'll be given the drug to tell the truth... ...and his brain will be mapped too... ...with which we'll get to know all their secrets. What's the problem then? Sir, the problem is that this will be done three days from now. And till then, these people will surely attempt something. After looking at the courage of today's attempt... ...it clearly shows that they don't lack funds, sir. And these people can do anything in order to get Rashid released... In fact, their next attempt could be even more dangerous, sir... And, maybe successful too. "Wonder who's in control. What's going on?" "You can't see the future, so keep walking." "Hijack. - See your world is burning." "Hijack. - Feels like hopes are burning." "Hijack. - Now your time is ticking." "Hijack. - Are you feeling lonely?" "Hijack. - The traveller doesn't know." "Hijack. - What's going on?" "Hijack. - We're the travellers." "Hijack. - What's going on?" "Hijack. Hijack." Hey, where are you going? - Where will I go? I've been looking for this Vicky since morning. I just saw the engineer going towards the remote apron. He must be with his stupid plane! I am at the remote apron. Tell me on my behalf that that plane has not moved... ...even by an inch in the last 10 years! Are you coming to the party? Get a nice gift for me! I'll get it, you fatso! Okay, bye! Vicky! Vicky! - Here! Why are you always lying here? I'm telling you, this plane is useless. It's a dead plane. You have to die in order to acquire heaven. What say, fatso? Heaven. You wait and watch. One day I'm going to make this plane fly. Pass me the wrench. - Wrench. I am the security chief over here... ...and you're making me a mechanic? Here. What's this? - Invitation card. Are you getting married again? - Are you mad? I'll have to die for that. - Why? You just said that if you want to acquire heaven... ...you'll have to die. Why are you spoiling your wedding anniversary... ...by inviting me? I knew. I knew you'd say this. But Neena! Women think they're always right. She sent me with the card. Okay, listen, how many years has it been... ...since you got married? 9. - 9 years. That's why. Are you going towards the hangar? - Yes. Then go. - Hey you! Okay, listen, you have to come to the party. Be ready, I'll come to pick you up. Okay? No excuses! Bye! - See you! Come on, hit him! Yes, very good! Come on, hit him! Come on! Yes! Push him! Come on! Good! Come on! Yes! Come on! Throw him! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hey, come on! Faster! Faster! Move ahead! Very good! Move ahead! Move ahead! - Beat him! Greetings. - Greetings. Is everything alright? - Yes, sir. Everything is alright. Anything else? Yes. Yes. Greetings. - Greetings. Hello. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes. Alright. What's the matter? Why are you so tense? Is everything fine? It's Abdullah's order to activate mission 'Parinda'. And we have just 3 days. But sir, just three days? - I know, the work is difficult... ...and we have very less time. But we'll have to do it, right? Sir, we've already lost Faizal, Irfan and Malik. We have just Shakeel and Altaf left as our strong points. Both Abdullah and I are aware of this. If this work is not done in three days... ...then it'll be too late. Do one thing; tell Shakeel and Altaf that we're coming. And what they were supposed to do tomorrow... ...they have to do it today. Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Come on. - Hey guys, come on. Come on! Ask your dad. - He will not allow. It's a free ticket. - But he will not allow. Girls! Why are you sitting here? You're so boring, girls! Let's have fun! Come on! Purab, she has a problem again! What did you do now? - I didn't do anything. - Not he! Her dad's problem! That's it? - Okay, I'll take someone else. I am not going to waste my free ticket, please. Bingo. - Just kidding! Neha, you won't have any problem. Your brother is going with you. But dad will never allow me! - Idea! Do you have a computer at home? What has computer... Do you have a computer at home or not? But computer... - Yes or no? No. - Okay, now listen to the plan. You need a computer in order to complete... ...your college project, right? Neha has a computer at home. Tell your mom and dad that you are going to... ...Neha's house for 3 days. And when we'll be enjoying there... ...her parents will think that she is in her house. How's that? Great! - Not bad! Yes... - Alright, come. Let's enjoy. People in the house! Welcome to Blackout! We have a special performance for you tonight! Put your hands together for a beautiful Brazilian bombshell! Maria! "Move your body." "See to it that it doesn't happen." "We mustn't lose the moment."

That's why, it'll be better for your nation... ...and its people if you listen to us. Your well-wisher, Abdullah. Sir, they've sent the copies of this e-mail... ...to all the leading newspapers... ...and leading news channels. By the way, Mr. Kumar, where did this e-mail come from? Well, sir, it has come from some internet caf? in Kazakhstan. Our team is trying to find out who has sent this e-mail. Sir, the TV and press reporters have gathered outside. Everyone wants to know whether we are going to release Rashid or not... We cannot release Rashid. This is against our principle. You're right, sir. And even if we release him... ...it might still not be the end of it. Ms. Simone, the media can be very useful to us at present. Just ask them not to exaggerate the issue. People should not panic. And one more thing, Ms. Simone. Tell them everything without telling them anything, alright? - Yes, sir. Okay that's good, Kumar. This plane is for pre-flight inspection. - Okay. Inspect its start board wing, right landing gear and port wing. Alright, sir. And top its engine oil up. - Alright, sir. - Alright. Hello. - Betty bought a bitter butter... ...to make the bitter butter better! Betty bought some bitter butter bitter... You lose! You lose! You lose! How's my daughter? - Papa, I'm fine. Okay, tell me why I called you. There's surely some good news. Wrong! - Wrong? Yes! Wrong! Not good news but great news! Then tell me quickly. I won't! You guess! Come on, come on! You came first in class? - Half right, half wrong. Half right, half wrong... you've topped the school! Right! After all, you're my papa! And papa, I've been selected for... ...the interschool quiz contest! And we're going to Amritsar the day after! And do you know how we are going? - How? By air! And teacher Neeta told us... ...that our plane will pass through your airport! Do wave out to me! Dear, but from such a height... ...forget me, even the airport won't be visible. Still wave out to me! I'll see! Okay, bye, papa! Bye! Bye! - Yes, Priya... Priya! Listen, dear! Yes. - Don't be mischievous on the flight. Always tie your seatbelt. And if you need anything... - Yes, yes papa. I know. I'm not a little baby! I'm a big girl now! Don't worry, papa. I'm a big girl now! Of course, you're a big girl now. And yes, take care of yourself. Heat food before eating! Okay, bye, papa! Bye! I love you, dear. - Love you, papa. - I love you. Is this blast related to the release of Rashid? We have taken the action that we should. You know that Rashid's outfit is responsible for this blast. We have found out where this mail has been sent from. Now the counter terrorist squad is... ...trying to find out where these people are operating from. Everything is under control. Culprits will be brought to book. There is no reason to panic... And no further comments. Madam! - Madam, one question. You just heard what the government has to say. Now we want to show you some pictures of... ...the bomb blast so that you can understand... ...the seriousness of the issue. This is Rupali Shah, Zee news. The pictures that you see are very shuddery. Philu! Philu! - What is it? What's the matter? You keep calling out to me the whole day! Please get my inhaler. I can't find it. Of course you can't find it. It's kept next to you. You'll be able to see it only when you wear your specs. Simple! Then... then at least get my specs. Oh God! What's wrong with you? Your specs are with you! Will you wear it or should I wear it for you? No, I'll wear it. I'm not that lazy. - Yes, I know. You do no work! I know what you are! Listen, just tell me if you're going to wear this shirt or not. To hell with your shirt! Get me my inhaler. I can't breathe! Oh my! The inhaler is kept right next to you. Hold it. You want me to pump it... ...for you or will you manage it yourself? No, I know how to pump it. I'll do it. - You'll pump it. He just keeps calling out to me the whole day! Philu. - What is it? What is it now? Hurry up! - Philu, I love you! What love? Let me do my work! Abdullah has informed that... ...the security has been tightened everywhere. That's why, all of us must take different routes. Some of us might also have to sacrifice... ...their lives in order to make this mission a success. God willing. - But I promise, the day only we will rule... ...this world, the name of every martyr... ...will be written in bold letters. We're going for our mission! Success is waiting for us. God is watching us! - Success is ours! God is great! Success is ours! - God is great! Hey, gorgeous! Look who's here! - Hi! Rajeev, why are you so late? Didn't I tell you he's going to come?

I have been sitting here since quite a long time. What's happening? Nowadays she comes and sits beforehand. Did you know that I was going to come and sit here? Do you start a conversation like that with every girl? Just for the special one. But you just said that whenever you come here... ...all beautiful girls over here come and sit next to you? Actually, you know what, you just got me! - I did. But I guess that's what makes you the special one. Vikram. - Pooja. Are you in a hurry? - Yes. I am already late. Somebody is waiting for me. It's not good to keep your husband waiting. And who ever told you I'm married? Well, husband, boyfriend, whatever. You never give up, do you? - Never. Can I call you? - Yes. Number! "This moment is so intoxicating." "Let the moment stop here." "Do you also... ...feel what I feel?" "I stay awake in the night quite often, remembering you." "The sounds of your heart touch mine." "Why am I so restless? Is this love? Tell me." "My thoughts question me. Why am I in this state? Tell me." "I stay awake in the night quite often, remembering you."

These moments today... ...might not be there in future." I thought I'll be late. There was so much traffic... - Okay. Saira, hurry up. We have a long day ahead. Let's go. 1, 2, 3 and 4! Hey, what are you doing? This is an airport! Yes, so I've bought tickets. But you haven't bought the airport! Then go and stand there. Yes okay. Yes. - Bye! Hey! Hi, Natasha!

It's not a technical problem! We have a hijack situation on hand. - I know, sir. I just came to tell you that we shouldn't... ...take the situation in our hands, sir. We should call the commandos so that... So that the terrorists get a perfect excuse to kill our passengers. Let me do my job, okay? Now get out of here!

You tell me, what are the orders for me, sir. Okay fine, just give me a minute. I will get back to you. And listen, just stay by the phone. Sir, hello! Hello, sir! Virun! Hello.
