- Ready? - Let's check it out. You don't see many properties like this one, I'm telling you. Especially in this price range. You literally can't do better in this area right now. And the schools are in the top five percent in the county. Are you guys thinking about kids? - We'll see. - Yeah, we... Oh, sorry. I'll take this. Seriously, what are we doing here? Can you really afford this? I'm gonna sell the condo, and I have enough money left over from the trust fund. It'll be fine. Yeah, I just... I wish I could contribute. Well, maybe if we were married, you could have some say in all this. And I would say we could wait until after the wedding, but since we don't have a date yet... And you heard her say you don't get many opportunities like this. Yeah, but did you ask yourself why? So why is the house still furnished? It's like the owners never left. Well, you're half right. The owner passed away rather suddenly. Oh, but not here. She died in a hospital, leaving all this behind. Her name was Marion Mitchell. The lawyers looked for her next of kin, but there were some issues there. And since the banknote was overdue, and no one could pay it, they forced a sale, which is perhaps where you come in. Well, I mean, I don't mind the furnishings. I can always just keep whatever I like and donate the rest. It's what we like to call "move-in ready." Yeah, but... it's still a little creepy, don't you think? Will you stop doubting? It's fine. Now if you come with me... - What's down here? - Oh, you'll like it, I promise. Honey, you gotta see this. What are you looking at? Ah, nothing. Hey, what's up there? Oh, just a crawlspace, I think. It's where the heating ducts cross. All right. Okay, come on, I gotta show you. It's awesome. Well, what do you think? It's pretty great, huh? Yeah, it's amazing. There's not another house on the market with something like this. Imagine yourself relaxing in here after a long day's work, huh? We could have some quiet alone time. You don't think it's a bit much, do you? Oh, I absolutely think it's a bit much, but that's what I like about it. Let me show you the guesthouse. - Guesthouse? - Yes. It's a little secluded, but you guys will love it, I promise. Great, yeah, of course. - Honey, you coming? - Yeah, yeah. Right this way. - Like it? - Yeah. One bedroom, one bath. The previous owners built this for their grandson, but you could always use it for an office. Some people do use their guesthouses for a little extra income. Oh, that's a good idea. Could be a good chunk of the mortgage I'd never have to worry about. Are you serious? As serious as a marriage proposal. Oh, I love the kitchen in there. Oh, this is great. So what do you guys think? I think I'd like to make an offer. I think maybe we should talk about this first, don't you? Eric, you know how these things go. I probably won't even get it. But it's worth trying, don't you agree? Allyson, I like the way you think. Why don't we meet back at my office, and we can talk about putting in an offer? - I'm not so sure about this. - We'll see you there. - I'm gonna go lock up. - Okay. It'll be fine. Wow. Beautiful house. Oh! Yes, yes, it is. Unfortunately, I think it just went off the market. That's too bad. I guess if you snooze, you lose. Especially in this area. Well, did they offer full price? Uh, I'm sorry. I can't really discuss their business. For a foreclosure, that's a chunk of change. Not really for this property, especially if you take the guesthouse into consideration. A guesthouse can always provide a certain amount of secondary income. You think they'd be willing to rent it out? I really don't know, but that's probably what I would do. Yeah, me too. Thank you for your time. Sure. If you're interested in any of my other listings, the website's right here. Sure thing. Thank you. Yeah. She's very pretty, isn't she? Pretty? Who? The house, of course. Yeah. She's a beauty. A real beauty. ♪♪ Hey, a couple more days, this place will start to look like an actual home. - Yeah. - Guess all you'll need is a tenant lined up for the guesthouse. Amen. And I'm gonna need somebody in there soon. That rent money is really gonna come in handy 'cause, honey, the sink's corroded. Ah... I think you're right. Add it to the list. Starting to become one expensive list. Joys of home ownership. Hopefully, the warranty company will cover it. And we did save a lot of money by keeping some of the old furniture. I just wish you had a more thorough inspection done. Will you stop worrying so much? You sound like a broken record. Listen, when you buy your first home, you can inspect it all you want, okay? You know what I mean. And you know what I mean. - Do I? - Yes, you do. Ah. Can I help you? Sorry to show up unannounced. I'm here for the guesthouse. The realtor lady, Shelly, recommended I stop by to check it out. Said you might be interested in renting it. Shelly must have forgotten to tell us about that. Oh. Is it still available? - Yeah, it is. - Okay, cool. Must be my lucky day. Maybe. Maybe. Sorry, man. You caught me a little off-guard. I was just getting ready for work. Sorry. I promise not to be long. So what do you do? I work for a music label, R&R Music. - Are you a musician? - No, no. I look at new talent, and if I think they're right for the label, I recommend they sign them. Oh, so kind of like a talent scout. Yeah, yeah, sort of. Sounds very exciting. Yeah. I just wish it paid better. Don't we all. Hey, it doesn't look like you're doing too bad. Oh, the house? Well, technically, it's my fiancée's house. She had a little trust fund set up. She was dead set on having it. Yeah. Fiancées, they can be pretty headstrong once they have their minds set to something, huh? What are you gonna do, right? So did you guys set a date yet? No. No, not, not yet. Why not? You're in love, right? Yeah. I'm not ready yet. You know, I'm not where I want to be in my career. I get it. Just waiting for that one big promotion that changes everything. Yeah, yeah. How did you know? Most things in life come down to money or lack thereof. Yeah. Did you just move in? Yeah, yeah, about a week ago. Haven't even really unpacked yet. Here, let me show you the guesthouse. Thanks. Yeah, so the previous owner had the whole place redone. New hardwood floors, new carpet in the bedroom, even some new appliances in the kitchen. - Looks good. - Yeah. Madeinart. Someone really knew their stuff. You recognize the brand just by looking at it? Yeah. In fact, I used to have one just like this. - You cook much? - Yeah, yeah. You could also say it's my business. Just last year, I opened up a new restaurant down in Long Beach. It's done well. My partners and I are looking to open up a new place over here. Oh, really? Whereabout? Well, we haven't found our space yet, but that's why a place like this, something short term, would be just perfect for me. You know, I'd think a guy like yourself would be more interested in a nice hotel. Yeah, maybe if it was a matter of just days, but this... this will probably take me a few weeks, and I'd like to supervise this personally, as much as I can. Since I'm passionate about cooking, I need a place that feels like a home. You know, with a real working kitchen and stuff. Yeah, I hear you. But we were hoping for someone a little more long term, like six months. I understand. Unfortunately, for me, once I finish what I came here for, I just gotta move on. I'll tell you what. I'll pay you the six months, all the six months just for my three-month lease. I'll do it up front, in advance. That's silly for me, but I like this place. All right. You can fill out an application. How much is it? $6,000, right? Yes. But that's not exactly how I was wanting to do this. Look, I'll do it. I'm in a hurry. I like the place. I can see myself here. Yeah, and I appreciate your enthusiasm and all, but... What else do you need, references? Sure, I can get you those. No problem. Okay, but we still gotta paper it up on the lease. Here. I'll take this, I'll fill it out, I'll sign it, I'll bring it back to you later. Perfect. Perfect. All right, so stop by in the morning, we'll get you a fresh set of keys, you can move right in. Sounds good, my man. Hello. Josh, this is Tara, my future sister-in-law. Tara, this is Josh. He'll be renting out our guesthouse. Then you'll be around for the party Saturday night. Party? Tara, what are you up to? Just being friendly to your new tenant. My new tenant? It's just a small birthday bash for my big sister. You should come. Yeah? Really? Sure, why not? At least that way, you can't complain about the noise. That's a good point. Thank you. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Thanks. - Thank you. - You bet. Oh. He can rent a space in my guesthouse any day. Classy as always, Tara. All right, I gotta finish getting ready for work. Oh. This should help with some of the repairs. Oh, we're gonna talk about this later. Uh, what? You know what. Okay, come on. Honey? Yeah, babe. Yeah? I wish you would've talked to me before you agreed to let that guy rent the guesthouse. Look, I was going to. It just happened so fast. Next thing I know, I had $6,000 cash in my hand. I thought you could use it. No, I know, and I appreciate you handling it. It's just... I thought it was a decision we should've made together. I know, I know. I completely agree. I was just trying to help. I know, and you did. It'll be fine. - I love you. - I love you. Here you go. - Thanks. - Yeah. You got a pen? Yeah. Oh! Look at that. Oh, this? One of my acts gave it to me to hang on to, so they could pay back a small loan I gave 'em. Never saw 'em again. I really don't like having firearms around the house, but how do you legally get rid of a gun? As long as it's not registered to you, who cares? Like they say, better safe than sorry, right? Absolutely. You never know when you might need one of those. No, you don't. All right. There you go. All right, looks good. Thanks. - Thanks. - Take care. How'd it go? Went all right. - Did you call his reference? - I did. They said Josh was a courteous and reliable tenant. Courteous and reliable. My, my. Still, just a tenant in a guesthouse? I mean, don't you think somebody who owns their own restaurant could do better than renting out somebody's guesthouse? I don't know. I mean, it's such a short-term lease, and he said doesn't like corporate housing. Yeah, but still, if he's just here for a little bit, why all the stuff? I mean, shouldn't it just be a few suitcases or something? He just doesn't seem like a short-term leaseholder to me. Do you wanna eat or not? - Yes. I'm just saying. - Just saying what?

What brings you out here? We received a complaint. Good. I'm glad I'm not the only one that was bothered by the noise. The only thing we heard about was you. Who called you? Your tenant. Says you turned off his power. No. I turned off my power. Let's hear what he has to say about it. Thank you for coming so fast, officers. I really appreciate it. - You called the cops on us? - Eric... I'm gonna need you to calm down, sir. So what happened? I recently started renting out this guesthouse from these guys. We were good. Everything was fine. I even attended a party of theirs. All of a sudden, the power's out, they're getting more aggressive. All I can think is I like to enjoy music more than they do. At 7:30 in the morning. Is this man your tenant, ma'am? He is. And there's a signed lease? There is. All right, well, if there's a signed lease, then legally speaking, he has certain rights. You can't just turn off the power because you want to. It's my house. I can't turn off the power to my own house? Yes, but you didn't turn off the power in your house. You turned off the power to the guesthouse. And according to the State of California, that is his house. Give me a break. No, it's okay. Just... You know what? Thank you, officers. It won't happen again. Do us all a favor. Keep it down. 10-4. Turn the power back on, okay? Understood. Have a good afternoon. Good afternoon. Well, at least we know how long it takes for the cops to show up around here. Would've thought they'd have more important things to do. Don't start. - Must have been a slow day. - Just stop. I want that guy out of here, don't you? Sure I do, but I think we're stuck. We can't just let the guy stay here. What choice do we have? Thank God it's only for three months. You know what? I don't believe this whole "I own a restaurant down in Long Beach" thing. I don't think he's left the guesthouse since he got here. What do you mean? I mean he's not here looking for properties. I don't know what he's doing or why he feels the need to lie about it, but I'm not buying any of it. Well, I'm not gonna wait around any longer. I'm gonna take care of this tomorrow. Good. Eric! How have you been? Married yet? Not yet, but we're working on it. Glad to hear it. What seems to be the trouble today? Well, a lot's changed since I've seen you last, Craig. - Allyson bought a house. - A house? Yeah, I know. I tried to talk her out of it, but it's her money, and she was dead set on having it. She bought a house. Is there a problem between you two? Sort of. Not that kind of problem, but she... We decided it'd be a good idea to rent out the guesthouse to help offset some repairs that we needed around the house. It turns out this was a terrible idea. We need this tenant out of there. But it's technically not your house. Right. It's Allyson's, but we live together, and I'm handling everything for her, so we both decided we want this guy out of there. Okay. Take a seat. - So you want 'em out. - Yes. On what grounds? He changed the lock on the door. That might be legal, depending on your lease. He plays his music as loud as he wants, whenever he wants. We can hear it from the main house. During the day? Well, yeah. Mostly legal. He's sleeping with my sister-in-law, for Christ's sake! Definitely legal. I've seen her. Look, Ally's working from home, okay? And this guy has no problem walking in uninvited. Why didn't she come with you? She thinks I'm overreacting. She sounds like a pretty smart young lady. It's not exactly the advice I was looking for here. Listen, Eric, no harm ever came to a man for listening to his significant other. Wait out the contract. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Now keep your head down, keep your distance, and wait for the tenant to move on. What about an eviction? Assuming you have grounds, which I don't think you do, eviction can be a long process. We're talking six months, minimum. Six months? That's longer than the lease. Then my advice is, unless he actually does something criminal, stay clear of him. Well, thanks for nothing, Craig. I'll send you my bill. Hah! Hello! Anybody home? Nope. Miss Bloom? Miss Bloom, are you home? Hey, it's Allyson. Please leave your name and number, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Miss Bloom, this is Shelly Conroy, your realtor. I came by your house just now to talk to you, but, um, I don't think you're home. Your front door was open, so I came inside. Listen, I just got a letter from the State about Marion Mitchell's next of kin. We need to talk. There might be a problem. Let's not bother Allyson with this right now. It's you. May I? This makes me out to be some kind of psychotic killer. I'm assuming you read all of this. Uh, mm-hmm. It's just too bad... for you. Craig said we should stay away from him until his lease is up. I could've told you that. And you're willing just to put up with him living there? Well, what else can we do? We've already had the cops come here once. Let's just let everybody cool down and steer clear of each other just like Craig said. And what if he comes back into the house again? Then I'll be the one to call the cops. And honestly, I don't even know how he could think of showing his face after yesterday. I hope you're right. All right, how do I look? Like you're gonna have a ton of fun without me. They're new clients. I have to make an appearance. So you said. Sometimes I wonder why we're even together. What do you mean? I don't know. It's just... sometimes I feel like we're just worlds apart, like two strangers who just happen to share the same space. And what is it that you even love about me, really? 'Cause sometimes I don't even feel like you do. Ally... I can't even begin to tell you how much you mean to me. I do love you, I do, for everything that you are. I know it doesn't always seem that way. I just... I want to be someone who's worthy to be with you. Someone who can hold their own in this relationship. And I'm almost there. A promotion right around the corner. My own money, my own means to contribute to everything. I'm almost there. You gotta trust me, okay? Yeah, okay. You go have fun, okay? It's work.

Oh, you don't want the whole office to know that you're screwing the intern? Maybe don't screw the intern then. Ally, she was drunk, all right? She kissed me. - Oh, yeah, right, Eric. - Why? Why would I ruin everything that we have for some girl? I don't know! You're the one who did it! And if it was so innocent, why didn't you tell me when you got home? Because you were asleep! Why would I bring up something that I knew would upset you? Upset me? What would I possibly be upset about? - Ally... - Don't touch me. Allyson, can't you see that somebody's trying to set me up? Think about it for a minute. Who even has your email address? You know what, Eric? Just... Just don't bother coming home tonight. - Ally... - Oh, stop! Wow. That was, uh, something. Yeah, that was. You got a couch I can sleep on? Hey, uh, I saw you pull up. You looked upset, so I figured you could use some company. And here. Um, I know you like red. You got a lot of nerve, showing up here. What do you mean? I'm just trying to be friendly. Friendly? Get away from my house, or I'm calling the cops. Whew! Okay. Let's not overreact here. I know we got off on the wrong foot, but Eric, he was pounding on my door. He was threatening me. I'm civilized. What do you expect me to do, fight him? Look, I don't know what you really want, but stay away from me and my house, or I will have you arrested, you got that? Ally, you know you don't mean that. Come on. Why be alone tonight? I can make us dinner. I know what you like. I know what you want. Unbelievable! Maybe another time then! Go ahead, keep the wine. I'm a nice guy, right? Be nice! Aren't I polite? They're not polite like me! They don't know me. Don't worry. I'm getting out of your way. Don't you think we should talk? Look, I told you, Ally. She kissed me. I couldn't stop her. I know you don't believe me, but it came out of nowhere, and that's the truth. Seriously, he must have been standing by, ready to take a picture and send it to you. - He's trying to break us up. - Who? Josh! That's what she said. Why would he do that? I don't know, but we can't let him come between us. Ally, we have to stick together, right? - You and me. - Eric... Ally, think about it. If I was going to cheat on you, would I do it in front of everybody we know? I love you. Go to work. We could talk about this later. So I can come home tonight? Yeah, I guess. I love you. I love you too. Excuse me. Eric! I'm so sorry for the trouble that I caused. If you need me to quit, I just want you to know I'll do whatever it takes to fix this. Look, it's not your fault. There's something else going on here. I just haven't figured out what it is yet. Eric. Hey, Ron. So Ally and I spoke. Pretty confident we just put this whole thing behind us. I won't be needing that couch again tonight. I got this email this morning. I was gonna call you, but I think it's a conversation best had in person. What's this all about? That's what I was gonna ask you. Oh, my God. This happened over 10 years ago. Yeah, but is it true? - Yes. - Christ. I can't believe this is being dredged up now. This happened right after high school. At least tell me you have an explanation for it. A few weeks after I turned 18, I got in a fight with some jerk outside of one of those under-21 clubs off Sunset. Turns out he was 17 years old, legally a minor. He started it, but of course he pressed charges. Jesus, Eric. I was only a year older than him. One lousy year. Yeah, but it's still seen as a serious crime in this state. Did they treat it as a felony? Yes, a small one. Look, I did my probation. This happened over a decade ago, Ron. Yeah, I hear you, but that email didn't just go to our staff. What? It went to all our acts, to our bookers, to our venues, to everybody we work with. Whoever did this put a lot of research into our company. - Does it say who sent it? - No, and I don't care, Eric. All that matters is that it's true. We have enough problems keeping our talent out of trouble, and now our own people? Just this morning, I got eight calls from investors screaming for your head. So what happens now? I might be able to save your job, but you can kiss that promotion goodbye. You need to go home and lay low. And if I were you, figure out who'd wanna do something like this. Hey, Josh! I saw your car out front. Let me in. I know what you've been doing. Come out here and do it to my face. You sent that email, didn't you? And you set up Jamie too. Answer me, you son of a bitch! Eric, stop. He's just gonna call the cops again. Come on, let's go back inside. It's not worth it. Hey! Hey, buddy, don't make me call the cops again, all right? Tommy. Surprised to see me? How the hell did you find me? You shouldn't be so free with my phone number. Somebody called me. Get the hell inside before somebody sees you. Jeez. Nice and cozy. Not a palace, but a lot better than the last place you were at. What do you want, Tommy? We missed you. I mean, you just packed up and left without even saying goodbye. You're working on something, aren't you? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh? Then what's all this about? Need a little change of scenery after that nastiness out in Long Beach? And what's that supposed to mean? After you disappeared, well, I came to thinking who might have done something really bad to the boss. Well, my thinking came to you. Now you're working on something, and I want in. There's nothing to get in on. - You sure? - I'm sure. Be a lot easier to work with a guy who knows the real you. The real you. This guy, Samuel Mitchell. - Uh-uh. - Where did you get that? Pinched it from your wallet before you left from Fiorenza's. Thought it might come in handy. Turns out I was right. Ooh, who's that? Little heartbreaker, I'll bet. She's none of your damn business, that's who that is. Don't touch that! Look at you. Sammy's got a girlfriend. Tommy... you really don't know who you're messing with. I don't? I think the cops would be really interested in knowing where you are right about now. You don't know anything. If I don't, then you don't need to cut me in. Okay, you know what? You win. You win, Tommy. Here's what I need you to do. I'm all ears. Nice. This is real gold. Allyson. Hmm? Did you hear that? What is it? I'll be right back. What are you doing here? I told you not to mess with me, Tommy. Don't just stand there. Call the cops! I haven't slept much, given everything that's been going on, so I took another walk. - And that's when you saw him. - Yeah. Through the window. What was I supposed to do? I felt like I had to do something. Now, I know we've had our differences, but I didn't want anything bad to happen to them. Anyway, the guy, he must've heard me coming because he turned around so fast. I saw that he had a gun, so I shot him. I shot him, but I didn't mean to kill him. Well, I can put you in contact with a counselor, if you'd like. I should. I should probably take you up on that. I hope you two appreciate what your tenant did for you today. It's not all thanks to me. Thank God I knew where Eric keeps his gun. That was my gun? You broke into my office desk? Relax. Of course I did. I had to. That's not a problem, is it? It's not a problem that the gun isn't registered, right? Actually, in California, it's not illegal to possess an unregistered firearm within the confines of your own home. Oh, thank God. That's only if the owner doesn't have any felonies. If he has felonies, you're looking at almost three years in prison. That's totally fine, right? Eric, you don't have any felonies on your record, do you? You son of a bitch. - Easy. - You... Eric! Eric! Get off of me! Don't hurt him! Are you okay, sir? Do you want to press charges? I don't think I have a choice at this point. Come on. You're coming with me. Call Craig. I will. How long until I can bail him out? Nothing like that can happen until after his arraignment. I'm gonna need you and Mr. Mason down at the station tomorrow to give your statements on both incidents. Copy that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. - Honey. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Ma'am? I'm sorry. That's not allowed. Oh. - Sorry. - Okay. I'm sorry, babe. I really messed up this time. Well, I hate that you're going through this. That bastard had it coming. Yeah. It's only been one night, but I miss you so much. I miss you too. Ma'am? Sorry. It sucks this had to happen over the weekend. It'll be Monday morning before you can even see a judge. But Craig will get you out. This is just a minor offense. It's not nearly as bad as actually shooting somebody. Yeah. I'm surprised they didn't haul Josh in here too. I mean, he's the one that killed somebody, and all they do is ask him a couple lousy questions? I mean, what the hell? It doesn't make any sense - No, I know. - Did you call Craig? Yeah, I called him last night, but he hasn't gotten back to me. I know it's Saturday, but hopefully he'll check his messages and call me back soon. You know, maybe we can file a countercharge against Josh for breaking and entering. You should ask Craig about that. At least that will put some distance from him and us. Yeah, I'll look into that. So what do you think happens when you do get out? I mean, what are the chances he'll just leave us alone? I don't know, but at least I'll be out of here. We can figure it out then. I love you. I love you too. Okay, we're done here. Will you be okay? Miss Bloom. Yes? I was just wondering. How did everything go in there? I got to see Eric. That was nice, but they're treating him like he's some master criminal. I mean, he roughed up a guy who had it coming. I would have done the same thing. I know how you feel, but you just can't go around assaulting people, especially in front of a police officer. I get it, but that was pretty minor, compared to what he's been putting us through. I mean, he's been tormenting us day and night, and he doesn't even know us. Yeah. That's what's been bothering me. I gave my statement to a detective. Did Josh give his? No, no. He hasn't shown up yet. Really? Well, did you find out anything more about the guy who broke into our house? Yes, we did. Come with me, if you can. Thomas Marshall. Garden variety thief with a long booking history. The question is, why did he target your house? I mean, it's set back from the road, off the beaten path, barely visible to anyone just passing by. Yeah. I mean, from the highway, you wouldn't even know it was there. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Stranger still, he was fresh in from Long Beach. - Long Beach? - Yeah. He had a business card on him from Fiorenza's, a local restaurant he worked at. It's almost as if he came here with the specific intention of targeting your house. That is strange. I suppose you'll run a thorough background check on Josh whenever he does come in? That's standard, any time there's a shooting. I'd be very interested to know exactly how that turns out. We're pulling prints off the gun, so we should know something soon. Also, I just wanted to give you this. It has my cell number on it. Give me a call if anything should go down again. Do you think I'll need it? Just call it an ounce of prevention. Thanks. This is Allyson. Hey, Ally, it's Craig. I'm sorry for the delay. I got your message, and I just wanted to let you know I just got off the phone with holding. What'd they say? I said the only reason they're detaining Eric is because your tenant said he's pressing charges. That bastard. Well, here's the good news. The guy never went down there to follow through. Meaning? Meaning they don't have any real grounds to hang on to Eric. It's a simple no-cash bail assault case right now. So that's good news, right? Right, but here's the bad news. Since he's been officially booked, they still have to go through the arraignment procedure. I'm trying to get that waived, under the circumstances, but... we'll just have to wait and see. Yeah, okay. Thanks, Greg. Just do the best you can. I will. And don't worry, Ally. Everything will be fine. Yeah. Bye. "Thomas Marshall." "Reliable and courteous." Dead. Fiorenza's, Fiorenza's. Fiorenza's. Fiorenza's. How can I help you? Uh, hi, yes, is this the Fiorenza in Long Beach? Yes, ma'am. Would you like to make a reservation? No. I actually wanted to speak to the owner, Josh Mason? I'm sorry, but that's not possible. Oh, is he not in? I can call back. Ma'am, Mr. Mason is dead. Dead? He was found murdered two weeks ago. Murdered? My God, that's terrible. Yes, it's very sad. There was also a large sum of cash stolen at the same time. Do they know who did it? No. They're still investigating it. But there was this employee here on a work outreach program from the State Psych Hospital. He disappeared right afterwards. He was a patient at the psych hospital? Yes, that's correct. Mr. Mason was a very socially conscious person. He liked to help people, give them a second chance. Would this patient happen to be Thomas Marshall? Tommy Marshall? No, but he did work here in the kitchen. He was let go just afterwards. But I really can't discuss that. Who exactly is this? Oh, I'm working with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. Thomas Marshall was killed two nights ago, during the commission of a burglary. Oh. Well, I'm not surprised. He was fired here for stealing. Do you know the name of the kitchen worker, the one they're looking for? Yes. Sam Mitchell. Do you think he murdered Mr. Mason? I'm not sure, but I think you might be on to something. Thank you for your time. Where is he? - Who? - Josh. I think he's ghosting me. Ever since your party, he hasn't been returning my calls. And I was just pounding on his door, and I know he's in there, and he won't even answer. Tara, trust me, that's a good thing. Let me fill you in. G to tell me there was an actual dead body in your living room last night? Yeah. Oh, and here's the kicker. Your loverboy's name isn't even Josh. So promise me you won't shed one tear for this jerk when I bring the hammer down on him. What I don't understand is why he would do all of this. What's the purpose? I don't know. But the woman I spoke to said he's some kind of mental patient. Mental patient? So he's dangerous? I'm not sure, but I know he's up to something. Just wish I knew what it was. Well, it's time we find out. You're right. Come on. Josh? Open up. I need to talk to you. Josh? Josh, are you in there? Josh! What a mess. Oh, my God. Is that my picture? How did he even get that? Wait a minute. This is the other half of the photo from inside the house. That's him, all right. Hold on. Now, Tara... Sam Mitchell. That's the guy. "State Hospital?" Well, what do you know. Just an All-American, card-carrying psychopath. What are the chances? Yeah, so this guy's name is actually Sam Mitchell. - Sam Mitchell? - Yeah. God, I knew this guy was bad news, but not that bad. At least you're off the hook for the time being. So where's Ally? She's at the house. And where's this guy at now? No one knows. He's probably skipped town by now. Why are the lights off? Do you think something's wrong? Come on. Allyson. Eric, is that you? Eric? Oh, my God. Honey, are you okay? Honey, what happened? You ruined everything, Allyson. Stay away from me. Oh, God. Look at us. I can't believe it came to this, especially when we could have been so happy together. What are you talking about? Please. You know exactly what I'm talking about. Us. You and me... and my house. Your house? Yes, my house. If you had a little more sense, you would have done your due diligence. But no. You don't even care. Nobody cares. That's why they locked me up. You're crazy. This is my house. Oh, that's what they told you. That's what they want you to think. But it's just not true. This is my house, and it's always been mine. Why? Because I grew up here... with my lovely grandmother. God, I miss her. I wish she was here with me. I was her favorite. I was her next of kin. It's just too bad my parents had to go away. They said I killed them, but I didn't do that. It was self-defense. Grandma knew that too, but they didn't listen to her. They treated her like she was senile, like she had no mind! It's a cold world out there, Allyson. They got me locked up, so they could sell my home from under me. They sold it to you. That stupid realtor, she finally gets it now. She finally understands. Listen to me, Josh... Or Sam or whatever the hell your name is... This is my house, and I will fight you for it, so you better leave right now before there's real trouble. Real trouble? Please! Spare me the theatrics! You know what, Allyson? I would have accepted you here with me, but then you proved to me how stupid you really are. You had a perfect catch standing right in front of you, but you stay with the schmuck who can't even make up his mind. I mean, I don't even have anything against the guy, but as long as he was here, we couldn't be together. You're out of your mind. Out of my mind? That's what my dad used to say. But I showed him... just like I'm gonna show you. Ah, you gotta be kidding. Allyson... Allyson, please. You're not the only one who knows their way around the kitchen. Ally! Honey. Ally. Tara, thank God. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. And you? Yeah. Come on. - Thank God you're here. - I got your text. - You guys okay? - Yeah. What's going on? Is Mr. Mason here? His real name is Sam Mitchell, and he's in the kitchen. Is he all right? Not exactly. Follow me. I love this garden. It's beautiful. Hey, how's Tara feeling? I spoke to her this morning. She's still pretty shook up. Yeah. I'm just glad we all made it out okay. Me too. You know that ring looks good on you. It does, doesn't it? Mm-hmm. Babe, are you sure we can afford this? I mean, should we consider renting the guesthouse again? Nah.
