Jack Vincent Senior was a father, husband, and author of many beloved adventure novels. On this sad occasion, we take solace on the words of Psalm 23. "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. "He maketh me lie down." Very powerful and dark forces of nature. It is told that he developed the ability to control the elements. An angry man with evil intentions matching away the harness that released the demonic elementals during the very ceremony which his brother was to officially become Chief of the tribe. Come in! Mommy said that dinner's ready. All right, tell her I'll be right there, okay? Okay. All right. Smells good. So? Finished. Congratulations! Thank you. Book seven finished. Another J. Steele mystery solved. Yeah, and I already know how to start the next one. Is it by putting the water on the table? It is actually, yes. Buddy. Where'd you get that? Your mother. Yup, grandma sent it to me. It's a boy scout knife. She said that it used to be your Dad's and I should have it because I'm old enough to join the scouts now. Right on. Spoke to her on the phone today. She decided to sell the cabin. Good. About time. Well they were cleaning everything up and they found a bunch of your Dad's stuff they thought you might want. Hm? Hey buddy, can I borrow the knife for a minute? This is sharp. You have to be careful with this, okay? Here you go. What's this? I don't know. Looks like a map to something. I don't know. So? Okay, well whenever you two archeologists are done, the dinner is and has been ready. Sorry. Let's go buddy. Tonight I sat with the Shaman again. Some call him the Guardian. He spoke of a legend from 500 years ago, when twin boys were born to a powerful Indian Chief. Their names were Anekiogima and Matchiawema. As the brothers grew, it became apparent that one was good and the other was pure evil. Anekiogima cared for the people in his tribe, following in his Father's footsteps. But his brother, Matchiawema, cared only for the power that such a position brought. Anekiogima was destined to become the next Chief of the tribe. Matchiawema knew this and revolted, and so was banished. In his jealousy, Matchiawema sought out and became very powerful with the dark forces of nature. It is told that he developed the ability to control the elements. An angry man with evil intentions, Matchiawema harnessed and released the demonic elementals during the very ceremony in which his brother was to officially become Chief of the tribe. An epic battle ensued between the tribe and the demons of the elements. Earth, wind, fire, and water. Anekiogima and his warriors battled the beast for seven days. Somehow the brave men were able to defeat three of the demons And as legend told them, quickly bury their remains. Putting them to rest for all time. Watching his demons fall, a distraught Matchiawema began a final incantation that would make him one with the remaining elemental, wind. The battle raged on for days. Brother against brother, Anekiogima gets the demon. The forest thundered as they fought, destroying everything around them, creating a massive clearing. It is said that the tribe feared that if the battle continued, it would destroy the world. But, in the end, the two perished together and a victor was never declared. The bodies were buried at opposite ends of the clearing, where the graves were sealed with the very headdresses that they wore in battle. Ever since, a Shaman has been designated by the tribe to protect the world from this demon. He still roams these woods. The Shaman told me that some day a great warrior shall appear for all time and put an end to this battle. Hey. Hey. It's six a.m. You couldn't sleep? Nah, I got a couple hours in. Then I can sleep on the plane today. I was having these crazy dreams. Oh, see, that's why I love you. You wanna talk about these crazy dreams? Well, there was a forest, a cabin, my Dad, I think. These glowing yellow eyes. I don't know, it's all starting to... Fade away? Yeah. Anyway, figured I'd get up and go through the box my Mom sent. What was in it? Actually, it's some of my Dad's old notes from the novel he was working on before he... Really? Yeah. Wow. Some kind of ancient old Ojibwe. Native American legend I think. You know, these dreams could be your subconscious trying to tell you something. Yeah, a little early for doctor mode, isn't it babe? Okay, I know, but this box comes with all of your Dad's stuff in it, at the same time that your Mom announces she's selling the cabin. It's just... Hey, I'm thrilled she's selling the cabin. Jack, I know you had issues with your Dad that we haven't talked about. Yeah, let's keep it that way, okay? That's fine. Okay. You know, maybe you should consider finishing your Dad's book. It could be therapeutic for you, maybe give you some type of closure. I don't know. I write mystery novels, not fantasy. Don't know if my readers would go for it. Then it could be just for you. I'll think about it, okay? Okay. Okay. Are you still running with Jim today? Yeah. I should probably go. So you're kidding right? No. You found the notes from your Dad's last book? Yeah, for the third time, yes. The last book he was writing? "The Wind Walker?" Yes. And what are you waiting for? I don't know. What's the worst thing that could happen? You're a naturally gifted author. All right, I feel a but coming along. But you've never fought for anything in your life. Wow, well hey, don't sugarcoat it Jim. Tell me how you really feel. When was the last time you had to do anything that made you even a little bit nervous? Exactly. One more time. What's the worst thing that could happen? I'm forced to deal some demons I've been avoiding for two decades. That's why you should write the book. - All right. - All right. Give my love to Mary and the kids. Will do. It's a perfect 75 degrees today, here in New York City. And it should remain that way for at least the next... And now back to Classic Big Band Sax with WKXR. Come on, come on! Jesus Christ Jack. Where have you been man? Can I get you something? Maybe a water? I didn't know you smoked. Have you ever tried chewing on a nicotine patch? Hey, what'd Jacobson say? You kidding me? I didn't tell Jacobson anything. Come on. Chicken shit. Of course I'm a chicken shit. God damn straight I'm a chicken shit. Nah, I think he'll like the idea. Wait, wait, you think he'll like this idea? No, no, Frank likes money. He's gonna hate this idea. Let's get out of here, come on. Jack, I don't know where you came up with this stuff, but you're killing me at it. How am I killing you? Let me state some facts first. You're currently writing one of the most successful mystery series of all time. And you pick now to do a personal project of your own. A project that you even say is never gonna be published. Hey, what's the big deal? Big deal? I'll tell you what a big deal is. Do you know how hard it is to get published now? I mean on paper anyway. Everything's digital, everything! When you started this 15 years ago, everybody was still buying books. Hell, they were still reading books. And you're still being read now. What book are you reading right now? His book. That's what I'm saying. Thanks. But if you take two years off, make my words, you're gonna be irrelevant. I'm telling ya. You're kind of a glass half empty kind of guy, aren't you Brian? I'm not a glass half empty, nor am I a glass half full guy Jack. You just took my whole damn glass away. Well I'm glad to see that you seem to think this is funny. Well, Mary thought it was a good idea. Look, you're delivering book seven in about 15 minutes. He's gonna ask for book eight. Probably in 12 months, probably in 10 months. I'm telling ya, he's not gonna take a liking to you taking two years off for your own special project. Well, I guess you'll just have to ask him nicely then, won't ya? Oh no, I'm not asking him anything. Not if I wanna work in this town again. Brian, you're an agent. You don't work now. You cut me Jack, you cut me deep. Gentlemen, how are we today? Frank, how are ya? Good to see ya. Not you, him. Son of my favorite author. I'm doing great sir, how are you? If I was any better I'd be you. Sit down boy. Your father sat in that same chair some 20 odd years ago. We started out together. Our success built this place. Talk to me. How is my book? I think you'll love it. I already love it. I don't even need to read it. The way that you weave your mystery son, mm. Make your Father proud. Thanks Frank. So, we've already sold the movie rights to Warner's and they haven't - even seen it yet. - Yes! So. Is it a nice set up for the next one? Yeah, yeah. Perfect set up for the next one. Which actually brings me to something that we wanted to talk to you about. I'm not gonna like this, am I? What's that? It's my Father's. Your Father's? Yeah, my Mom decided to finally sell the cabin up north and they found some of his stuff while they were cleaning. "The Wind Walker." I can't believe it. This is all of it? Well there's that and some audio tapes. Might be more at the cabin, I don't know. Jack. Oh, I think it's brilliant. I think it's brilliant. What's brilliant? Jack, I've been doing this since before, before you were born. And you don't think I know where this is heading? You do? Of course, you wanna finish it. How... Little buddy, great minds think like. Simple. Famous author disappears while writing his greatest work, 25 years later his son finishes the story. Yeah, that's it! And you came here to ask me for a break from your current contract. Am I right? Exactly. Okay, you got it. In fact, I will see your bet and I'll raise you. What do you mean? The cabin, is it sold yet? No, not yet. We're gonna send you back. Sorry, what? Everything is about video these days, right? At least that's what my niece tells me. Okay, we're gonna send along a little film crew to capture you in your element writing where your Father once wrote. Frank, hold on a second... Hear me out. We can use the footage on the internet to promote it. Show somebody at the talk show, circulate it on. Build the anticipation. Frank. Jack Vincent Junior returns to the place of his Father's inspiration to finish what was once the most anticipated book in the publishing world. A famous author doesn't like the idea of returning to the cabin where his Father disappeared from while working on said novel. A little help here? He doesn't wanna go back to the cabin. Yeah, pish posh. You're a grown man. There's no reason you can't go back. Besides, it's the only way I can really sign off on this thing. Really Frank, I've got the most comfortable home office. Little buddy, sometimes we have to leave our comfort zone. My niece Mandy, she's a film student at the University of Michigan. I'll call her. I'll have her put together a little crew. You can leave tomorrow. Actually, tomorrow is Rose's birthday. Wonderful! We leave on Monday. Look Jack, you were the one who came to me asking me to modify your contract. And I've come up with a way to make it work and to make it lucrative. Benefit us both. Jack, I think it's a great idea! Then you go. You should go too. Wait, what? You can take a little video camera and get all the inside cabin stuff. Him writing, him thinking, figuring it all out. Yeah, right, but I don't know how to use any of that stuff. A monkey could do it, so I think you can handle it. The return of the most awaited book in publishing history. Brilliant. You are brilliant. I'm brilliant. You, not so much. Look, Frank, I really appreciate you being able to work with me on this, but I haven't been back to the cabin since, you know. Why don't we just forget I said anything, okay. Too late for that my boy. The wheels have been set in motion. Like I said, I've got a perfect setup for the next book in the series, I'll just work on that. Come on Jack, that's not what you really want. I can see it in your eyes. Something drew you to this mystery. Something deep inside. Besides, by the time you finish it, I will have put together the most lucrative book and film deal of all time. This one will take care of your children's children. And his children's children. Jack. What? This is what they call one of those pivotal moments in a story. You have to make a choice. And it's entirely up to you to make the right choice. So either the story goes forward, or it stops here. And young man, it is all up to you. I'm sorry to let you down Frank, but I just can't do it. We're not finished, sit down, relax. Son, you're not letting me down. You're letting yourself down. Here, you're gonna want this. You fellas go talk. Talk to Mary. She'll see the brilliance in my plan. Really. Trust me. What's to be afraid of? I look forward to seeing you very soon. Thanks Frank. Thanks a lot. Get him home. Right. Really Jack? I mean, it's just a couple days. I'm starting to feel too far outside my comfort zone. And I was just getting used to the idea of finishing my Dad's book, but I'm not going back to the cabin. Well I think you should go. What's the worst that's gonna happen? That's what Jim said. Well, you go up north, let them film you writing, thinking, whatever it is that you writers do. And then, you can come home and finish the book. And I've only got a couple clients next week, I'll just postpone and watch the kids. You sure? Yeah. You are an amazing woman. How did I ever get so lucky? Well you tricked me. Nah, you think I did? How dare you. Daddy? What are you doing? Just talking to your mom. It didn't look like you were talking. Oh we're just talking. It looked like you were taking off Mommy's clothes. What do you need big guy? I lost my damn green goblin. Ah, you know we're not supposed to use that kind of language in this house. Now where'd you hear that word? Me? I shouldn't be using that kind of language either, all right. How about we make a deal not to say that? Now come on, let's go find that damn green goblin. Let's go actually just find it. Okay. Oh my gosh. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Rose. Rose baby, are you okay? Did you have a bad dream? Yes. Do you wanna talk about it? No. It might make you feel better if you do. Are you sure? I promise. Daddy left us just like his Daddy did. Baby, you know whenever your Daddy leaves he'll always come back, right? But Daddy was nine when his Dad left. And tomorrow is my birthday. Oh baby, that's not gonna happen, okay? What happened to your Daddy? Is he in heaven? Yeah baby. Yeah, he's in heaven. I bet he's looking down on us right now. See now, don't you feel just a little bit better? Yes. Come here. Stop! Well that's a fine how do you do isn't it? Hey listen the company's got me filming this whole thing. Soup to nuts, front to back, the whole creative process. Now you know as well as I do I'd rather set my hair on fire than film you doing anything, but you're gonna have to go with me on this, okay. Sounds awesome. All right. Come on in, Mary's got some coffee. Okay, and we're rolling. You know I write naked, right? Now you're just teasing. Hey Brian. Welcome to my nightmare. Hey, hey. So I told her you'd be okay, but she's just... Okay. You. All right sweetheart, it's time for me to go. I'll miss you Daddy. I'll miss you too. I'll be back before you know it, okay? Promise? Promise. Now you know I've gone away before and I've always come back, right? Yeah. Well this time will be no different. No matter what? No matter what. Now come here, give me a big hug. Now I want you to take care of your Mom and brother while I'm gone. - Okay? - Okay. All right, okay. Wait. Take Boomer with you. You sure? You don't wanna keep him here with you? He'll keep you safe. Yep, you heard the lady Boomer. All right, I'm gonna go say goodbye to your brother. Why don't you guys go outside and play for a little while, okay? Okay. All right. Give me another hug. Love you. Hey buddy, I'm gonna take off for a few days all right? How come? Well, they're making a little TV show about me writing a book. Sounds boring. Yeah, I know. Why do you have Boomer? He's coming with me. Keep me safe. Really? Yeah. Hey, if a big grizzly bear comes along, Boomer here can tell them what nice kids I have and then they'll leave me alone. Well here, take this too. You sure? Thanks buddy. I'll take really good care of it. All right, love you. Love you too Dad. Call me when you get there? I'll call you from the road. I might not get a signal up there. This is gonna be good for you Jack. Just keep telling me that, all right? Come on. Sorry, accident. Love you. I love you. Be safe. Come here. Here we go! Hi everyone, I'm Mandy Jacobson. We're three film students from the University of Michigan working on our final class project. We're shooting a documentary film based upon the legendary Jack Vincent Senior. Our project is going to unravel right before your very eyes as we hike through the woods and call this home away from home and search out any clues, including his cabin in the woods. It's over five miles long and hangs from those two thick steel cables. Is that why it's called a suspension bridge? That's right Jack. It carries people and supplies to a land of adventure. It's gonna carry you and me to a place of inspiration. You wanna know a secret Jack? That's where my stories come from. The woods, the trees, the rivers, the mountains, they all tell stories. And if you're not afraid to listen, they'll talk to you. If you open up your mind, you can see it. Not to many people have the courage to do that Jack. Do you have the courage? Close your eyes. Open up your mind and let your imagination flow. See with the eyes inside your head. Jack. Yeah. We got that phone interview to do, let's go. All right. Come on. What were you thinking about back there? Nah, we used to stop here on our way up north. We stand at the gateway to Michigan's upper peninsula. A place of adventure and inspiration for many. And once the home away from home for author Jack Vincent Senior. It is here in this vast wilderness that he had a cabin, his writers fortress. It is also here that he was last seen working on his most anticipated novel of all time, "The Wind Walker." Great! That was perfect. Hello, this is Mandy. Hey Mandy, we have Jack Vincent Junior on the line now. Is now a good time to talk? Absolutely, thank you so much! Hello Mandy, how's the drive going? Pretty good so far. We plan on camping near your cabin tonight. So we should be able to meet up with you tomorrow. Sounds good. Okay, can I ask you a few questions? Yeah, fire away. Mr. Vincent... Please, call me Jack. Jack, you're in the midst of writing a very successful mystery series. Your books are turned into movies almost as fast as you put them out. Your name is mentioned in the same breath as Stephen King, Elmore Leonard, and John Irving. Is there a question in there or you just trying to boost my ego? Why "The Wind Walker?" I guess you could call it a tribute to my Father. I just hope I do his book justice. You were only nine when he disappeared, how do you think that's affected you? Well, you'd have to ask my wife. She's the psychologist in the family. You know, overall, I had a very happy childhood. So what do you honestly think happened to your Father? You know, I think nothing more interesting than he went for a walk one day and ended up getting lost. Minutes turn to hours, hours turn to days. Most of Northern Michigan is still a vast wilderness of woods. Your Father was an avid outdoorsman, he often included hand drawn maps in his books. Do you really think the most logical explanation is that he simply got lost? Well, you know the old axiom, that truth is stranger than fiction. All right, I think that's enough Mandy. I think we're all set. All right, well thanks again Mister, sorry, Jack. All right, thank you very much. Are you sure you've got everything? All right. All right. Can you pull that? Hello, Mary? Jack. Mary! Jack, it's me. Mary. I can't hear you. The phones barely work here. Jack, are you okay? Did you get there? I have like no signal. I can't hear you! I have no signal. Are you okay? Turn right in - 900 yards. - Who was that? It was the GPS. I can hear you, I can hear you! All right, love you. What? I said I love you. I know, I just wanted to hear you say it again. Ha ha very funny. Jack? All right, bye. I love you. Turn right in 400 yards. I know it's up here somewhere. No, you know what, I think we missed it. Listen, will you please just turn that off? No, no, no, I think we need to go back to that last crossroad. Hey, hey, hey, don't mess with that, that's our only way out of here. I swear to God Brian, I would throw it out the window if I could. God has nothing to do with this. I don't think, let's hope. Yes, I know, shut up! Turn right in 50 yards. Here we are, here we go. Yup, no this is it. You know it is. Recalculating. Come on in son. Hey, hold on! I just have to get the camera! Okay, wait, wait, wait! Hold the fish up. Smile, smile! Come on smile! Come on Mom! Smile, smile! Punch you. Run! Oh my God! What? My Dad's gonna kill me. I told him I'd call the second we got here. Not good. What's the big deal? Her Dad, trust me. Here, call him. Thanks. No service. Figures this is the only place on earth a cellphone won't work. Hey, listen to this. "The call of the demon was so powerful "that I felt the entire force "shake with it's resolve. "And before I knew it, it was upon us, "moving with the very speed of it's namesake." Ooh. "Each footstep thundered across the land. "The Wind Walker was here." So are you guys sure I can't crash in there with you? Let me think, uhhh, no. Oh come on. You know, this is real exciting. Yup. Well, I guess I should be grateful that you're not naked. You don't sleep naked, do you Jack? I guess we'll just have to wait and find out. God. Well, that's it for me. You sure? I was just about to do some writing. Could make for some riveting footage. I'm glad you're having fun with this. You know, I could be in Gramercy Park now at Pete's Tavern having a McAllen 12 enjoying myself. But no, here I am in Shangri-La. Well, I'm going to bed. Not too far behind you buddy. Say, you're not somebody who snores a lot or God forbid, farts a lot in their sleep? Guess you'll just have to wait to find that out too. Ah that's lovely. Just lovely. Goodnight. Goodnight Jack. There they are. Just like two old lovers. As you can see, the wind is so loud that it woke me up. I thought a freight train was coming. What the hell was that? What the hell was that! A wolf. There's no wolves. Bears maybe. That's bigger than a bear! Great. Where are you going? Outside. Throw rocks at it, scare it off, something. I don't know. Are you kidding me? I don't think that's a very good idea. Well you guys can't leave me in here all alone! Listen. Do you guys hear that? You guys don't hear that? Mindy stop it, you're scaring me. What the hell was that? It's coming closer. Quiet. I think it's attracted to our sound. See. Even the wind died. Oh my God! All right, we gotta get out of here! We gotta get. We gotta get out of here! We gotta get out of here guys! We gotta leave! No, we have to go. There's something out there! We have to go! No, please! Don't! No, you can't go out there! - We have to go! - Are you stupid! - We have to go, now! - No! Man, are you kidding me? Go, I am not going out there! I am not doing it! We can't! Oh my God! We gotta keep going! Come on! All right, come on! Come on, we gotta keep going! Oh my God! Jack. Jack! Holy shit. Look, right? How could this have happened? How could this have happened? Oh no, I mean I heard the storm last night, but God. Hey, do you have your phone on you? I do. But I just tried to get on Facebook and... Facebook, really? Yeah, I'm always on Facebook when I have to... Yeah, no, I get it. Geez! Did you try the phone up in the cabin? It's disconnected. Well maybe if we head back towards the main road we can get a signal. Well it's worth a try. I mean, either way, we're gonna be walking a hell of a lot more. God. Boomer. Is that another storm coming in? What, do I look like Al Roker? A little. Jack, Jack. Hello! Anybody here? Geez. I hope nobody was in here. Jack, I'm not so sure this was the storm. Hello! I wonder where they went? Hey, Brian. Look at that. Maybe that'll tell us what happened. What? Oh man. Come on. Mandy. Come on sweetheart, we gotta get out of here. We need to go. Come on, we're gonna die if we stay out here. But Beth... Trust me, you'll die out here if we stay. Beth! All right. All right. I think I know where we are. I think we can get to the cabin, but you gotta trust me all right? We're gonna stand up, okay? Are you ready? Come on. We need to get out of here. As you can see, the wind is so loud that it woke me up. I thought a freight train was coming. What the hell was that? What the hell was that! A wolf. Jack, look man. Jack, this changes everything. We gotta change our plans now. Let's get the hell out of here! I'm not kidding Jack, let's get the hell out of here! What? What about the kids? What about the kids? Jack, we don't even know where they are. We don't even know what direction they went in. Hell, we don't even know what's left of them. Come on, let's just get out of here. Well, I have an idea. What? Every time you have an idea, somebody gets hurt. All right, all right, - this is my Dad's, now look. - Right. - We're here. - Yeah. This is the main road and we found the kids campsite around here. Right, right about here. Now look, there's a cave right there. You remember the cave? If they found this last night they may have stayed the night. Now, we can definitely make it before the storm hits. Worst case scenario we stay the night there... No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Stay the night? You want us to stay the night in this cave with all this going on? You've got to be kidding me Jack! Look, it's not optimal, but if we have any chance of finding the kids... God damn it Jack, let's just get out of here. Oh man. You really think they went in there? Jesus. God, the only thing alive in this cave is a bear... Hey, do you have a light on your phone? Oh my God. It's your Dad's story. Yeah. I'm starting to think he didn't come up with it though. It's almost like he discovered it. Yeah. Hello! I prayed that you would come. I haven't much time. I have to tell you. Tell me what? Your Father came to me asking about the legends. I told him of the brothers and what had been done so long ago to ensure they do not destroy this world. But, in my vanity I told him too much. I tried to save him, but he learned too fast and he was consumed by what he discovered. What do you mean? He did this. He brought the demon back. Demon? I had fought it. I have kept it at bay until now. But now, now I am too old. I have no blood behind me. The lineage is broken. I can no longer protect this place. The beast is gaining strength as I'm losing it. But you, you man, you, can put an end to this all. You can stop it forever! Me? You will do this. You have no choice. Your blood is part of this journey now. You must undo what your Father did. For if you do not, you will die. You and many others after. Undo what? The graves were marked and sealed many years ago by my ancestors. He disturbed a grave. He let loose the demon. I am sorry. What are you saying? The demon was born. I was able to put it down for a time, but now, as I die, it returns. Take this. Follow it to the burial ground, release the brothers. Let them finish the battle. I pray good will triumph. Listen, this can't be right. My Father was a writer. He was a fiction writer. You'll be tested. Beware. Matchiawema is a changeling. He will come at you with all your fears. Time is running short. I'm sorry. It was for the greater good. Jack. Let's get out of here, come on. Come on. Jack, are you sure about this? I mean, shouldn't we just keep heading out, let the authorities know? We leave him there overnight, the wolves will get at him. Well do you want me to take another turn? You can get the body. You've got to be kidding me? Not kidding. Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! It's weird. Get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way! Oh God. Geez, hurry up. Brian, you need... Jack, you've gotta see this! This is amazing! Get over here and help! Oh no! Brian! Jack! Brian! Brian! All right you did it Dad! You put me in your story! Dear Jack my beloved boy. I knew that in time you would come. I knew that in time the binding of our love, our lives, would draw you here into this. I must tell you I've thought about you. I've missed you. Every minute, every day. Being stuck here, lost in this purgatory, this hell on earth has pained me in ways unimaginable. I did a wrong, and now, unfortunately, it is up to you to fix it and put an end to all this. Jack, I'm truly sorry my son. Oh my God! - You wouldn't believe - He got her! What we've been through. He got her! Come on, come on, come on! Come on, come on! Please don't, please... Just stay here. You're gonna be okay, all right. I'll be back. Okay. Jack, please. Why are you doing this to me? I just wanna go home. Come home with me baby. It's me. In order to complete the ceremony you must bury the remains of the two brothers. Keep them separate from one another, just as you found them. Bury the demon in the valley and Anekiogima in his own grave far away. Dad! Dad! I buried him just like you told me to! What did I do wrong! Jack. Thank you. I knew you'd come back for me. It's okay. Oh my God. Oh my God! What happened to you? I'm okay. Hey! Come here! Let me see you guys. Come on, let's go inside. Oh you got on me! Dad!
