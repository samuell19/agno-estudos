Names of some charachers, mentioned in the movie ... ... have been changed for legal enforcements. May I ask a question, if you'ld not mind. Why don't you keep living in this house? I've spent my childhood days here. I've had my best days of my life here. I moved from here, when I got married. My father passed away 6 years ago. My mother died in the previous year, too. Sorry to remind of your bad memories. Of course, you're free to live here or not. I just wondered why you live in another home for rent, although you have. I decided to rent it and live in a different house by its income. I can't live here with memories. By the way, let me bring your copy of rental agreement. Here it is. We've signed. Check it. Thank you. No need to check. Who is that? I'll be right back. Mother-in-law? I just wanted to visit. Are you busy? No. Come in. - Have a slipper. - Thanks. Mother-in-law, let me introduce you, this our landlady Alev. Welcome. Thank you. If you'd informed me your visit, I'ld have prepration to welcome you.

Yes, landlady Alev has just come to home. I gave her a copy of rental agreement. That's alright. No problem. Your mother is here for a visit. My mother? When did she come home? She's been here up to half hour. We've been chattering. She asked me our adress. But she told me that she'll come on the weekend. It's a good suprise for me, too. She told me that she's gone for shopping and decided to come by us. Can I talk to her? She's at bathroom now. I'll tell your greetings to her. Alright. See you. Mother-in-law? What's happened? Mother-in-law? Are you alright? I had some dizziness. I wanted to have a glass of water to take my pills. Then I've fallen to floor. - So, has your dizziness gone? - I'm OK now. Could you hand my pills and glass of water? Do you feel better? It's OK. Don't worry about me. Don't tell it to my son. He'ld worry about me. Now, you feel good? Yes. I feel better.

Scared that everything'ld be revealed. And to be lose face to everybody. How long could it last? Why did you marry to her? I've met with your husband today. I've confessed him everything about us.

Now, I'm fine. - Kadir. - What? Your mother didn't want me to say, but she almost fainted because of dizziness. Why didn't say it before? Well. I don't know. She requested me not to say. Mother. Are you alright? Why do you hide your health issues? No, she didn't say to me. It's bullshit. Care yourself good. OK. Go to hospital tommorrow for a full medical check. Shall I come to help you? Alright. Now go to sleep. How about my father? OK... Good night. Kadir. I'm sorry. OK. No problem. Alev has also worried about your mother. Nothing to worry. It's so normal to have some health problems for elder people. Yes. You're right. Any news about Elif? No. I'm looking forward to her good news, too. What's happened? Calm down. Good morning, honey.

Is our daughter safe and sound? She's alright. Nothing to be afraid. Don't worry. See you. OK. Thanks for calling. Yes. Hi. I'm Eda's mother. Is my daugher safe? I heard that traffic accident. Accident? What accident? No accident reported to me. How could it be? I've informed a few minutes ago by my husband. He told me that you called him about crash. No. I called nobody. All shuttles are here. There must be a mistake or a horseplay. So... Thank you, principal. Kadir? Excuse me. I just popped in. I couldn't call you, because I forgotten my phone at home. My mind is so tangled nowadays. May I come in, if you're available? Come in. I've been upset nowadays. I've nobody here to unbosom myself. Come in please. Tell me what makes you upset. I feel myself no good, Alev. I've imagined Kadir in an abandoned store today. I don't know. Since the day my mother-in-law has been at home, Things are getting wierd. Everybody may have bad days. Don't mind so much. May I call my husband from your phone? My phone is at home, not with me. Yes, sure. Hi. Kadir. It's me. No, I forgotten my phone at home. I'm with Alev now. OK. I'll say. See you.

No problem. I was about to go. Thank you for your minding to me. Excuse me, if I had bothered you. Bye. How about my father? He's gettin worse after you moved from our home. Father, I didn't leave you alone. I've been visiting you frequently. He refuses to take medicines. I hardly make him take pills. You have to take your pills, father. It's for your recovery. Have you gone to hospital for yourself? I'm OK. No need to go to hospital. Just some dizziness. it's over now. I think, I should hire a nurse. To take care my father. She can help you, too, for housekeeping. I don't need a nurse. I don't want a stranger in the home. I can do my own housekeeping myself. Any good news about Elif? No, I heard nothing about her. I just questioned about her. Just same situation. Her situation wrings my heart. Mother, don't talk about this matter on and on. It's no use to talk about. Let me go. As you wish, son. My wife's awaiting me. See you, father. I love you both. Mother, I'll come later. Call me whenever you need me. Let's keep in touch. What's up there? He just dropped the pills. Come again, OK?

Why don't you be meak and mild in front of son? What are going to say him? Are you going to say him that I'm dulling to you to chop? Huh? You goddamn old fart! It's all because of you. I feel myself no good, Alev. I think I'm going to be mad. As I turned back, I saw Kadir again. Then I got scared and fallen. Mum, shall I help you? No, daughter. I'm almost to finish. Go to bed to sleep. OK, mum. Mum, shall I help you? Mum, shall I help you? Eda? Come to up! Birol? Mum, I'm here. Eda? Eda? Alev! Mum! Mummy, come here. Eda? Eda! Eda! Mum! What are you doing here?

Otherwise, they would be after you. I'll. But you do not, OK? 'Cause, you're innocent. Kadir. It's not me who's on the bed next to you. Kadir? Kadir? Kadir? Kadir? Kadir? Kadir, please talk to me. You make me scared. Dilek. What's happened honey? You have nervious break down. Because of Elif, right? They're my tenants my family's house. Then, I've visited them for a few times. I had no acquaintance with them before. That's it. I could tell nobody so that I might be assumed as mad. So, it's good to see you. I could share what I've been experiencing nobody else but you. Why the hell did I meet with them? I wish I hadn't met them. My goodness! It must have been turned into an obsession. Let go out for some fresh air. You'ld feel better. If someone told me these kind of stuffs, I'ld have never believed. But when happened to me. I've experienced. Let's go. I'll take you somebody. Tell her. She may give you reasonable information. Can we come back before Eda's come? We'll not be late. Don't worry. She knows everthing. You'll be amazed. She's not a acquisitive trickster. She knows a lot of stuffs. And good predictions. Best medium that I met. You'll see. She'll reveal the source of your problems. I went her for myself. I was amazed about what she told about me. I don't feel myself good. I'm afraid of getting worse. No need to be afraid. Trust me. Can you pull over here, please? I forgot to take some money. Are you joking? I'll pay for sure. Take it please. Dilek, my tenant, is calling me. Never mind. Don't answer the phone. My goodness. Keep walking. Open your mouth. Open. Open your mouth. You have to eat this. If you do not, I'll give you nothing else to you. Open your damn mouth. You eat this. Open your mouth. What's your name? Alev. How old are you? 32. What's name of your mother? Hatice. What's name of the man? Which man? The man who's disturbing you. Kadir. Did you tell her? Don't drivel. How could? How could she know? Trust me. Open your palm. Hold it tight. What's name of his wife? Dilek. Have you ever been with this man? No. There's a black art over you. The man whose home you've been... is no good man. He's draggng his mother into a disaster. Evil one. Do not go that home. Do not think about him. Get him out of your mind. Do not ever think about him. He has been binded. Do not ever utter his name. Eda, my sweetie. I love you too much. Mummy. Are you OK? Yes. Just a bit tired. Mum. Can bring something to eat? Sure. Shall I bring some milk, also? Yes. - Mummy. - Yes. I dreamt a bad dream yesterday. What did you dream? I was travelling with school friends to forest for picnic in the nature. This the peaceful place where the butterflies, frogs live. We were catcing butterflies. I caught biggest one. Then, I set the butterfly free to save its life. In late hours, I go to sleep. At night, I awake and get outside. I see two men, awating me. Men, tall and with dark faces say me; "There's a stable over there. We go there" While walking, We see 5 or 6 people eating something around a tree. They say "Don't go there. We demolished it and... built a bathhouse instead of it.' One of them grabs my hand by running to me and says "There're black dwarfs there." He says "There're black dwarfs there only. Black dwarfs. Black dwarfs there." As I come to bathouse, I see you there, too. Then I get chilled. An ugly man with a huntchback welcomes me. He says " My name's Kadir. Tell your mother. She shouldn't be chilled here." Look, he's over here. Let's go to sleep. Eda? Mummy. We got married. Honey. Do you feel better? Yes, this place relieves my mind. I've been so disstressed in the home. Everything'll be good. I'll be right back. You need anything? No, thank you. You came here with your wife? What the hell are you doing here? Hush! You're putting to the blush me. I don't care! None of their business. - Cut it off! Shut up! - Are you bulling me punk? - Get out here bitch! - No, I will not, jerk. - I'll fix all! - What are you going to do? Dilek? What's up with you? Let's get out of here. I'm afraid that you may consider me as a mad. What's happenning to you? Tell me. I've been imagining so evil imaginations. I'm aware of it. I'd been waiting you to tell me. You may not believing in me. Yesterday, I imagined our daughter marrying. With our tenant. What are drivelling? I know. It's a wholly nonsense. So, I couldn't talk about these. Yesterday, my phone ringed. It was you. You told me that shuttlle bus crashed to a car. I didn't call you. I know. But it was neither a dream... nor an imagination. I don't know what to say. I've been imagining Kadir, Dilek's husband. He says "Leave me alone." Alev, I don't understand what you mean. So wierd. Don't leave me alone. I don't know what's going on. Maybe we'd rather to go a psychiatrist. Would you mind to go? Alright. I'll go. Oh! Welcome. What a suprise to see you? Thanks. May I come in? Sure. Come in. Where did you get my adress? I asked the cab driver who you brought you home. Your neighbours showed me where you live. Come in. Sit down, please. How are you sir? May God heal you soon. He's been lying on bed all day. But, he feels no pain. What can I offer to you? A glass of water, f wouldn't mind. His medicines fallen. No problem. I'ld fix it. I don't know how to explain you. I had no other choise else to come to you. I don't get. What do you mean? For a few days, I've been having terrible visions. Dilek and Kadir have been in my nightmares, aimlessly. Good heavens. I went a medium for consultation with my friend. She told me that you hide a dark secret and you've been weeping for them. So, I don't know what to request... I'll be right back. Did I hurt you? You feel bad? He had an imprecation. He didn't heed my warnings. Goddamn woman. He didn't pay attention to me. He didn't. Don't cry. Pull yourself together. Don't shed tears. Have a seat. Calm down. Their story is dark, quite dark. Speak nobody about what I'm going to explain. I don't want to ashamed by everybody. OK. My son loved a woman else. They'd been engaged to marry for 1,5 years. The girl had fallen in love to my son. We later realised that she had mentally deranged. She had been in psychiatric wards for 4 or 5 months. Then her doctors discharged her because of no recovery and she back to her family. So, my son waived to marry her. While my son went to visit her, he met her sister. That's my son's present wife, Dilek, sister of mad girl. My son dated with her for one year without my information. Then they have married scrictly. Did your son marry with sister of his fiancee? When she heard the marriage her mental health got worse. She started to run away somewhere frequently. Nobody didn't know where she goes or what she does. Some say she made contact with demons and became companion of them. What's relation this story between me? I don't know. But I'm also having horrible nightmares. She kidnaps my son for revenge in my nightmares. That's why I visited my son. I can't sleep at nights. I've been thinking my son's safety. Can you talk to him on behalf of me? He's going to be drowned into dark. My mind is so tangled up. I've been suffering too much. I've been living in agony for years. See? His poor father had apoplexy because of this reason. He's been aware of everything. But nothing to do. We have been living helplessly... as two old parent, crying in this home. Excuse me if I had hurted you. Let me go. My daughter is about come from school. As you wish. God will not forgive me. Feel no remorse. You did nothing wrong. You're not guilty. If so, who's guilty? This piece is good for there. But, colour of piece should be darker. Colour of piece should be a bit darker to fit the pattern. So, we should solve jigsaw puzzle more carefully. It's getting OK. Alev. Have you made a decision about the issue we talked yesterday? I had no time today. Do not neglect it, please. OK. I'll take care. Oh! That's getting clearer. I dropped chocolate onto the jigsaw. You made it sweeter. Are you OK? Let me check the who the hellion did. Do not scare. Dad'll check it. She'll be punished like her sister. Tonight is going to be her last day that she breaths. She became companion of them. She's her mad sister. Tonight is going to be her last day that she breaths. Did you catch anyone who broke window? No, there was neither nobody nor a trace at the outside. Eda scared too much. Hope she sleeps well. I'll inspect around tommorrow one more time. Have a nice dream. So do you. Good night. Mum. Mum. What's up with you? Nothing, daughter. Keep sleeping. OK. Yes. Who's it calling Kadir? My mother called. She didn't speak. My goodness! No answer. Maybe phone is out of service. She could have called unintentionally. Yes. Line must be no good. Maybe I should go to check her. Shall I come, too? No need. Sleep. I'll check and come back ASAP. Mother! Mother! Father! Where's my mother? I was told everything clearly. She did evil things to you, too. She did evil things to all. Now both of them got what they deserved. Sister! TWO DAYS LATER Terrible. What I've been living in has been too terrible. God damned us. There's no explanation else. Kadir's mother had done black magic against Elif. Elif was here, She told me all. Elif had been pregnant from Kadir. She miscarried her baby because of black magic. Then she acquianted to djinns. They told everything to her. They showed all what my mother-in-law did against her. As she understood what's going on, she took her revenge from Kadir and his mother. Kadir's mother sent demons for me, too. She did sorcery by having taking glasses... which we have drinken tea. Just to set Kadir apart from me. Just to keep him with herself. She treated her husband cruel. She'd been drugging him all day to keep in silence. She used his husband's blood... to invoke demons for black magic. But I deserved. I deserved. I deserved all. God cursed me. I was told everything clearly. She did evil things to you, too. She did evil things to all. Now both of them got what they deserved.
