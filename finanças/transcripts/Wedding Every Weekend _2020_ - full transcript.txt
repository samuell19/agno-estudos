You sure you don't want to be doing this with Greg? We already did his, at the hardware store. Seriously? I get table linens, he gets a 20-volt cordless drill... everybody's happy. Wow. Maybe someday you'll be the one with the registry. Ah, I can't really picture Colin picking out china patterns. I didn't say it would be with Colin. Okay. Not now. Do we need anything else? Maybe an espresso machine? Yes. On it. Do you know anything about these? Not much. Sorry. Ohh. Don't worry. I have it on good authority you can register at the hardware store. I'm not getting married. I have a store credit about to expire. Gotcha. These ought to do it. Okay. I think I'll just go with this one, then. Uh... What? The platinum one... it's better. You can recycle the pods, it's got a bigger water tank. So, you do know something about espresso machines. I know this much... having the best espresso machine doesn't really matter. It's not gonna make your relationship any better. It just makes better coffee. Oh, well, thank you for the tip, but I'm... I'm late for work. Good luck. Okay, Mary, I'm gonna stretch the median nerve, okay? Ow. Elbow up... -Palm up. ...Ow. I'll give it a little stretch here. Ow! Okay, Mary, you just have to trust the process. You know I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you. I know, you've always taken wonderful care of me. You know who else is wonderful? My nephew. Did I mention he's one of the biggest attorneys in Portland? You have. Yep! Several times. With a very nice Craftsman, east of the river. Did you know that? I did. Mary. This has to stop, because you know I'm with Dr. Colin. Yeah. I know. Hey, Dan? Oil pan gasket's shot. Can you call around the usual dealers? See if somebody has an original part? Sure. What do you want me to tell Mr. Dow when he calls, asking if it's done? Well, you can tell him his car is jinxed. Fine. You just tell him it's almost impossible to find original parts for cars like this these days, and I'm gonna be working on it until I'm dead. Just tell him I need a couple more days. Will do. Oh. Hey, Dan? You are so jinxed. Okay. Uh... Nate... Thomas? Mm. Ha... have we met before? We have. -Bureaux. -Ah. You were registering for wedding gifts. -Yes. -You were? No. Uh, I'm not getting married. No, that was my best friend. I'm the maid of honor. I can get rid of the espresso machine if it bothers you. That's funny. So why don't we get to why you're here? Come on in. Uh, in your doctor's notes, it says you've got a probable... tsk, ACL sprain? Mm-hmm. Yeah? How did you do that? Slipped on some oil at work. Ouch. What do you do? I restore vintage cars. My grandmother left me a 1976 Plymouth Valiant. You want to buy it? Oh, you know, I'd love to, but I specialize in high-end classic cars. This one has dual faux- sheepskin seatbelt covers. Oh! Well, in that case, sold! -Let's take a look at that knee. -Yeah. Just put it up here. Extend it for me, where you can. -Right there? -Yep. -Yep, yep. -Right there? -Yep. -Okay. Yeah, it doesn't feel too unstable. I'm thinking probably twice a week for six to eight weeks. Oh. What? Well, I just kind of thought you would put a brace on it and give me some exercises, and then I'd do 'em at home. Ah. Yeah, it doesn't really work like that. Well, thank you. I'm sorry, wait. You're leaving? Yeah, I mean, I can't afford to take that kind of time. I'll just get a brace from the drugstore. Doctor said it would heal eventually. Maybe, if you don't do anything to make it worse, which is where physical therapy comes in. I'll look up some exercises online. It's not the same. -I'm sure it'll be fine. -Okay. Wait. You've already paid. Why don't you let me just tape it up for you for the day? Okay. Have a seat. Okay. What this does is it lifts the skin, creates a space between the muscle and the dermis layers. That space releases tension from the ligament, which increases blood flow and speeds healing. There you go. -Give that a try. -Yeah. Wow! Are there instructions online, so I can do this at home? I'm sure there are. Best of luck. Okay. Hey! So I was thinking, maybe we should do something different for Saturday night date night. Really? What did you have in mind? Well, I... thought we could try a new pizza place. I don't know, Colin. Sounds a little dangerous. You know me. I am all about taking risks. It's gotta be gluten-free, though. I'll find a place. Hey, Brooke! Ginny! Vicky! Amanda! If I knew you were coming. We should've all come together. Things have been so crazy, we weren't sure we would make it. Planning a wedding is like a full-time job. Tell me about it. Not to mention buying a home. That's right! When do you move in? We close two days after our wedding, which means we're postponing the honeymoon and now we can come to your wedding. I'm so glad! -Oh... this is awkward, though. -What? One of these masterpieces was gonna be your present. We should get food after this. Absolutely. Ladies? This way. We should probably go and get set up. Can I ask you a question? How have I kept my artistic genius a secret all these years? Yeah... Well, that, and... ...how did you know Greg was "the one"? When I realized it never once crossed my mind that he wasn't. Hmm. In the beginning, I thought Colin was. The beginning is the easy part. It's exciting. You're telling all your best stories, you're still discovering new things about each other. You haven't found out that the other person eats cereal for dinner without milk. That should've been my first red flag with him. The thing is, Brooke, eventually, you're gonna have to decide if the person you're with is someone you want to make new stories with. And if he's not... you have to let him go. I just don't want to get my hopes up and be disappointed. I just don't think I can do that again. Then don't. It's almost summer. Take a vacation from dating. Stop worrying about meeting your soulmate and be your own soulmate for a while. Just stop trying? Yes. No pressure, no disappointment. Just do what makes you happy. Like being my maid of honor, for example. Actually, that does make me very happy. Maybe I should wait to break up with Colin until after, you know, all the weddings are done. You're seriously thinking of staying with someone just to avoid the singles' table? Ah! What am I doing? Oh! It's okay. Just do your best, and if you make a mistake, just paint over it. Can I do that in life? I wish, sister. Oh! Look at you. Okay. We need to talk about the elephant in the room. I was thinking the same thing. We should go back to the old place. I was thinking we should break up. Wait. What did you just say? I'm so sorry, Colin. But you and I, we're just, um... we're not... right together. Wow! Okay. That is a... much bigger elephant than I anticipated. I know. I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were so unhappy. It's not that I'm unhappy. It's just... that, um... You and I are like... pineapple and mushroom. Which one am I? -Pineapple. -Good. And pineapple and mushroom are really good on their own, but, together, they're, um... doesn't... work. Yeah. I guess you're right. Well... I guess it's time for this delicious pineapple to find his ham. You will. Oh. Your knee still feeling okay? Yeah. You know, it's holding up. The woman who taped it up at the PT clinic the other day, she was pretty incredible. Oh, was she, now? Okay, I'm just saying, I'm glad I can keep working. There's a guy in Seattle with a '56 Rolls. He wants me to rebuild and restore, but I got to get this Mercedes outta here. Any word on that gasket? Yeah, I'm working on it. Oh, yeah, he's waiting on parts, too. And it's getting harder and harder to find original parts for these cars. I know, but that's what our customers are paying for, Dan. Right, but the longer these cars sit here, the more money you're losing. And all the other restoration places are using new parts built for the old cars. And they're turning cars around three times as fast as we are. I realize that, but they're not authentic restorations, they're Franken-cars. We rebuild, from the ground up, with original parts, and when we're done, they look and they sound and they drive like the day they rolled off the assembly line. I mean, that's... that's what sets us apart. Yeah. That's the business my dad built and I promised him I would keep doing it the same way. We'll find what we need. Just gotta keep looking. Oh! Hey. Uh... You still want these? They were in the bottom of the drawer. Yeah. I can't believe you have other friends. Uh, well... Gretchen is a friend from when I used to do ballet. Scott is an old buddy from college. Amanda, as you know, my old roommate. Vicky and I went to summer camp. Nina's a client. Will was one of my first customers. And you know Greg, one of my oldest friends. In fact, I'm in this one. You're the best man? Nope. Just "man." Got off easy. And the most important one of them all... yours. I guess I'm gonna have to call everyone and change all my "plus-ones" to "just ones." You're gonna have such a great summer, Brooke. I know it. It'll be so good for you to stay single. Only people in happy relationships say that. Well, at least now you're not in an unhappy one. I know. I just didn't think it would be so awkward between me and Colin at work. Well, then one of you needs to go work somewhere else. Or this might be the perfect time for you to open your own physical therapy clinic. Maybe next year. You said that last year. Win-ner! Again. Yeah, I'd feel bad, except I was always so much better than you at real soccer. It's nice that you have this. Hey! I forgot to tell you the good news. What? Buying me dinner tonight? You wish. No. Ginny's maid of honor just got out of a relationship. And? And... I think you guys would really hit it off. Want me to set you up? No. No! Come on, wedding set-ups are the worst. Don't! Do not. Okay, okay. She's pretty cool, though. Yeah, so was Molly, and then she wasn't. And I never saw that coming. Yeah. -Hi. -Hi, honey. Where's Colin? I thought he'd be here. Uh... Sorry, guys, but Colin and I broke up. Oh, that's too bad. My plantar fasciitis was really acting up. That's your first reaction? Okay. Let's go outside. Well, he was a nice enough guy, but I could tell that he wasn't the one. Well, why wouldn't you say something before? Well, it wasn't my place to say anything, until now. You did the right thing. There you go, love. Aw, doll. You are the best. Aw. I feel like I'm never gonna find what you guys have. Oh, of course you will. But... What? Well, maybe you want to stop dating for a while, just take the pressure off. Well, Ginny literally just said the same thing. Well, that Ginny is a smart cookie. Maybe you and Ginny are right. Maybe I should just... take a break. The entire summer... stop worrying about dating, worrying about finding my soulmate. Just... take care of me. The summer of Brooke. Mm. Yeah! Yeah, I like that. I'm gonna do it. You know what the best part of "Summer of Brooke" is? What's that? You having so much time to help me. Well, I'm sure Greg's helping, too. Oh, you would think so. You guys okay? We're fine. I just don't want to be the one in charge of planning everything for the rest of our lives. I want us to be a team. You are a team. Wedding planning just might not be his game. You're right. Thank you. That's what I'm here for. That, and quality control. Okay, just bend your elbow here. Okay, Mary, I'm just going to have you relax for me a little bit, and... So, uh, I still have your friend Gretchen's wedding in my calendar for tomorrow. Oh. Um... J-Just putting it out there... if you need a date, let me know. I am the king of the conga lines. I'm sorry, I... I just don't think it's a good idea, Colin. I'm fine on my own. Oh. Well, great. I just didn't want you stuck at the old singles' table. My nephew's free on Saturday night. Not now, Mary. I didn't know what I was missing until the moment we met. And I knew you were my soulmate when we both declared our mutual dislike for having to share a bucket of popcorn at the movies. It really is the worst. Hi. Brooke. Excuse me! Hi. Could you could do me a huge favor? One of our other wedding guests has a brand new "plus-one" in her life that she brought last-minute. And since you ended up not bringing your plus-one, is there a chance you could switch tables so that they could sit together? O-Oh... uh... Sure! Why not? Thank you so much. And hey, you never know. Maybe tonight you'll meet someone special. That... that is literally the last thing that I want, so. Oh. Oh. Oh, you're at the singles' table, too. I just sat a beautiful young woman over there. I'm just here for the cake. Oh. -Oh... -What? Uh... Hi. Hi! What're... What're you doing here? I mean, I-I know what you're doing here. How do you know Scott and Gretchen? I only know Gretchen from ballet, when I was a kid. You? Scott's an old college buddy. Trade school! Dartmouth. Right. Yeah. Yes... ah! I just figured, since you fix cars... Restore cars. -Yeah. -It's a big difference. I know. How's the knee? Fine. You won't admit that it still hurts, will you? And that I was right, and that you need physical therapy? Feels great, actually. In fact, I taped it up myself. As per the Internet. Nailed it. To the bride and groom! Thank you. Which is your favorite? What's that? Bread. I'm a sourdough guy myself. Well, I guess if I had to choose, it would be... ...rosemary. Excuse me? Sir? Is there any way we could procure some rosemary bread for the young lady? No, no, no, no, no. That's okay. I'm okay. I'm okay! A woman of your beauty deserves anything she wants. So, are you friends with the bride or the groom? The bride. Me too! See? We already have something in common. I think this is fate. That is a... That's a big word. Um... Do you really think so? I feel it. Yeah. Would you like to dance? I'm sorry to break this to you, good sir, but... there's no music. Yeah, there is. What's your name? Wow. Thank you. No problem. Well... I think I'm gonna go take a walk around the grounds. Alone? Uh, yeah. Being alone right now is kind of my... my jam. Ow! Okay. I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea back there, but I'm really not looking at meeting anyone. Not in that way. Well, that's a relief, because I'm not either. In fact, I'm actively avoiding it. Oh... Well, that's good. Bad breakup? Something like that. -You? -Not bad, just recent. -Mm. -Yeah. Sort of just taking a break from relationships, actually. Just... hittin' the "pause" button. Oh, I get that. Except I hit "stop" button. Deleted the whole playlist. Yeah. Hey, can I walk you back? Uh... no. Thank you. I... I like it out here. It's peaceful. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Until the part you get mauled by a bear. Okay. There aren't any bears out here. Oh. Oh, my... okay, all right. Walking back. Yeah. Is that a bear? No, it's probably just a squirrel. Ah! That's a bear. Okay, walk a little faster. -All right. -Let's go. Ah! -Is that your knee? -Nope. Why won't you just admit that you need help? Because I don't need help. I need more tape. No, what you need is an MRI. Yeah, which means surgery, which means I can't work. I'm the only one at my shop who can do the rebuilds. Taking time off is not an option. Can we please just drop it? Fine. It's your knee. But, for the record, you taped it wrong, and it's gonna get worse. -Whoa. -What? What? Bear? No. It's an old Fordson. From the 1920s. Look at the workmanship. Beautiful. Nothing fancy. Just good engineering. Nowadays, everything is so... complicated. Uh, it sounds like dinner's almost over. Means it's almost cake time. That's the best part. Yeah, it is. Well. Thank you... for, you know, being my wedding buddy. Thank you! It was, uh, unexpected. Well, take care. You too. Be sure to get an MRI. Not gonna happen. Mm. Okay. So what do you think? Yeah! Thumbs up. It's good. Don't I get a say? You told me to bring Brooke because if you had it your way, our wedding dinner would be a nacho bar. -And it would be awesome! -He's not wrong. It would be awesome. Oh, you're not helping. Thank you, Brooke. My buddy, Edgar, said the same thing. Actually, he's one of my groomsmen. I think you two would really hit it off. Mm-hmm. Greg! She's not dating, remember? She's on a "Summer of Brooke." -That's right. -You sure? He's a great guy. I have to admit, I've met him a couple of times, and he's pretty easy on the eyes. Hey! Only second to you, sweetie. Thank you, but every guy that I have dated has been a great guy, he's just not the right guy. So just take me off your "setup list" until future notice, okay? Okay. Okay, mm-kay. Thank you. What's up next? Mazel tov! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Will is one of my oldest customers. Nina's one of my clients. Wait, I didn't see you at the ceremony. Yeah. Yeah, I just got here, actually. I needed a new shirt. They left the plastic shoplifting thingy on it. Please don't tell me you tried to get that off yourself. Okay, I won't tell you that. Please don't tell me it was the kind with the dye inside like they use for bank robbers? Okay, I won't tell you that either. -No! -Or that it destroyed a perfectly good tie... Oh, no! Oh! At least they felt terrible and gave me a new shirt. So here I am, little late, but I got a pretty good excuse. Oh, Nate. I don't know how to tell you this, but they forgot to take the shoplifting ta... What? Wow. You got me. Nobody ever gets me. That's good. It was too easy. Yeah. You look great, though. Yeah. So do you. I'm starving. Yeah. That always happens to me. Well, not when you're with "wedding buddy." Is that official? I feel like it has to be. I don't see why not. Come on. ♪ You make me feel good ♪ Lost in the moment ♪ You make me feel good ♪ Hearts running wild ♪ You make me feel good ♪ Love I can fall in ♪ Know that I'm all in ♪ It's you every time ♪ You make me feel good ♪ Lost in the moment ♪ You make me feel good...

Don't look now... this dude's checking you out. Who? The guy that looks like he handcarves his own furniture, who recently saved a struggling bookstore and writes poetry. -Wow. -Like, good poetry. -All in one? -Yeah. Oh. I'm good. What? Not your type? I meant it last week, when I told you I was taking a break from dating, and honestly, I love not having to think about it. -It's kind of freeing, right? -Mm-hmm. I mean, really, you just have to think about yourself, your future... you're all that matters. Exactly. And now, our newlyweds would like to invite their parents to dance beside them. Nina and Will would now like to invite all their friends and family to grab that special someone and join them on the dance floor. Would you care to dance? I would. Thank you. -Again. -Anytime. Too bad you're not coming to my friend Amanda's wedding next weekend. I am. I'm friends with Vicky. What? No! Okay, you're definitely not coming to the fourth wedding then. Greg and Ginny. Greg is one of my oldest friends from school. -No! -I'm in the wedding! -I'm a groomsman. -I'm her maid of honor! -What? -No, wait. I've been doing the seating charts, and I definitely haven't seen a "Nate." Did you see an "Edgar"? Oh, y... you're Edgar? I go by my middle name for obvious reasons. Only two people in this world call me Edgar. My mother, when she's angry at me, and Greg because he knows how much I love it. I have to tell you something. Greg tried to set me up with you for the wedding. He did the same thing to me! -I shut him down so hard! -So did I. Perhaps we shouldn't tell them that we've met. No! Definitely not. They'll never let it go. No. Hey, have you got a gift for Vicky and Amanda? I looked online. There's nothing left. I have to go in the store. Oh! Where are they registered? Bureaux. Of course. We could meet up and shop together. Yeah. If you want. The first time you met me there, I was, uh, a little testy. No! We didn't know each other then. Now we're... Now we're wedding buddies. I promise not to talk about espresso machines. It's a deal. ♪ Your love is everything to me ♪ ♪ With you is where I long to be... ♪ This cake is really good. So good. ♪ ...So don't waste precious time ♪ ♪ And give your love to me ♪ It's easy... Another spectacular brunch, love. So? Another weekend, another wedding, huh? Yeah. I hope all this isn't too hard on you emotionally. Oh, I'm fine. I got a friend going with me to all the weddings. -Yeah. -Oh! We're just kind of hanging out. That's great! Do I know her? Uh, him. And no. "Him"? Him who? There's... There's a new "him"? Nope. Not a "new him." Remember? I'm taking a break from dating? It's the summer of Brooke. It's not even worth even talking about. Oh, sweetheart, I think you've forgotten how this works. You see, we feed you brunch... ...And you feed us information. Hmm? I'm just gonna clear the plates real quick. And then I'm gonna go shopping. Thank you. Hey! -Hi. -Hi. Sorry I'm late. That's okay. I just printed off the registry. Ah, yes. Did you see the price on these linens? I could get them one pillowcase, or I could buy myself a yacht. Oh, that thing's 300 bucks. How do you know that? Wow! Okay. Uh, well... maybe it doubles as a superhero shield. Oh... now it's worth every penny. You two are so cute. When's your wedding? Oh, we're not together. Nope. Wedding buddies. Oh. We are! She doesn't care. Well, I do. Forget about the linens. Let's, um... Let's find something. Yes. These lowball glasses are pretty nice. Still pricey. Oof! Well, maybe we just, uh... go in on them together? Sure. Thank you. Is this your car? No. This is one of my restorations. Your customers let you just take their cars out for a drive? I gotta take them for a road test. One of the parts I was waiting on forever finally came in. The engine's running smooth as silk. Well, it's... it's beautiful. She's beautiful. You know, when you talk about a car, it's a "she." Oh. Yeah. Right. Of course. It's like a whole step back in time. That's exactly what my dad used to say when he finished one. Oh. I didn't realize this was a family business. Yep. He left the whole thing to me when he retired. I pretty much just picked up right where he left off. Where are your parents now? Are they still in Portland? No, they got tired of the gloomy weather. Moved to Miami. Now Dad says all he has to do is sit out front of the condo, it's like a never-ending auto show. Actually, that sounds pretty perfect. You want to get some lunch? I would love to... uh, yeah, but I've got to work. That must be pretty weird, working with your ex every day? Yep! Yeah, it's awkward. I've been looking at other clinics, but there's nothing available at my level, and if I left, I'd be taking a pay cut, so. What about opening your own clinic? You been talking to Ginny? That's what she's been saying. So what's stopping you? Tch. Money. Time. Fear of failure. Yeah. Well, as my dad always said, "The only way to truly fail is to never try." Oh. Interesting. Like how your knee's gonna fail because you refuse to try physical therapy? Wow! Walked into that one. Actually, you limped in. Oh! You're relentless. I just care what happens to my patients. And that's why you're gonna succeed in business. Bye. So, I was wondering when you'd be returning my Oregon State sweatshirt? Oh, uh, well, I only wore it that day, to the football game, and then I... I gave it back. Mm... Ah, it's fine, forget it. Keep it. Well, I don't have it. Yeah. Okay. Colin? If this is the way that things are gonna be, I don't think that we can work together anymore. Yeah, it has been pretty awful. But, you know, there's no other clinic in town that can afford to hire either one of us. Trust me, I've looked. Oh. Well... actually, I don't need to find another clinic, because I'm going to open one on my own. Really? You've been talking about doing that forever. I didn't think you'd actually do it. Well... I am. Yeah. First, I'm gonna make sure that all of my current clients are taken care of, and then, after that... well, I guess it's time to move on. What did I just do? Oh. Hi! Oh. No. No. Of course I won't forget the gift. Oh, yeah. Sure. Okay. I will... yeah, I'll see you tomorrow morning. Okay. Who was that? Oh, just a friend I'm going to Vicky and Amanda's wedding with. I heard a man's voice. Did you? Brooke, I thought the whole point was not to jump into a relationship. I'm not! Then who are you going with? No one! Just tell me who it is. Fine! It's, um... N... well, it's Nate. Who's Nate? Edgar. Edgar. Greg's Edgar? -Yeah. -Are you serious? Yeah. Do you know what this is? This is fate. I can't wait to tell Greg. Wait! How does Nate know Amanda? He went to summer camp with Vicky. This is so exciting. Tell me everything! Listen. There's nothing to tell. We're just wedding buddies. We... we're not looking for anything else. -Zero pressure. -Fine. Zero commitment. Zero talking about it. But... Okay. But we can go together, right? Yeah. Yeah, sure, we can, uh, go together. Like a double date? Like a carpool. Whatever you want to call it. A carpool. Hi, Ginny! I was just gonna call you. Nate's gonna pick you guys up first, and then we... Oh. Oh. Sorry. Yeah, no, you guys should absolutely stay home if you're not feeling well. For sure. Feel better. Okay. Talk to you soon. You ready? Ready. Oh... seriously? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh. Come on! They must've given me a bad part. Unbelievable. It's just one thing after another with this thing. Do you think you can fix it? I don't know, at this point. But I do know we're gonna have to leave it here, take another car to the wedding. Well, I'd take my car, but I left it at the mechanic's. We could take a cab back to the shop and get my car, but we're gonna miss some of the ceremony. I don't want to miss a minute of the wedding. Uh... There is one other option. Wow. This car needs a lot of work. And yet, I'm strangely drawn to it. Yep! The tantalizing smell of vinyl, dust, and old lady perfume. Does it run? As far as I know. What do you think? I think we have a wedding to get to. I gotta admit, I'm kinda digging this ride. -Yeah. -Listen to that V-8! I had no idea how solid this thing was. Who knew all of this awesome was right in front of me this whole time? I know, right? I want to show you something. This piece of candy has been in here for over 30 years, and I never throw it out. I don't know, I think it's strangely comforting, for some reason. That's sweet. And that candy is definitely not anymore. Look at that car. Wow! Amazing car. I'm assuming you're being sarcastic. Not at all. Everyone's looking for cars like this right now. They're just so... ironic. The uglier, the better. Well, well, well, look at you. Trendy and you didn't know it. I know, right? Hey, if you're ever looking to sell, let me know. Oh, this is... it's not... Hey. -You okay? -Yeah. And now you may kiss. Thank you so much, you two. It was so nice to see you. We'll see you later, though. -Bye. -That was so sweet. -Ah! -Hi! Oh, thank you. I am so glad that you could make it. That ceremony was beautiful. He cried. -I didn't cry. -Just... Okay, there are flowers everywhere, I had allergies. I cried so hard. I didn't realize that you knew Nate. Or that you knew Brooke. Do you two want to sit together? We can make that happen. I know the bride. I do too. Uh, no. No, no, no. We don't want to bother you. It's fine, wherever we are. We're good. Okay, great. Enjoy. -Okay. We'll see you later. -Congratulations. Thank you. Well, I guess we should go and find our tables. Yeah. I kind of just assumed we would be at the singles' table. Yeah. Hmm... Okay, I'm table three. There you are. Table 12. Hmm. I mean, I guess we could've taken Vicky and Amanda up on their offer. Yeah, but I don't want to bother them... -No, no, no, no, no, no, no. -...with that, right now. We could ask somebody if they wanted to switch. -Trade! Yeah. -Do like, uh... Sure. Yeah. Um, excuse me? I was just wondering if there was any way that my, um... buddy and I could sit at the same table? Okay, oh, I'm sorry, but I have specific instructions to put you at those specific tables. Sorry. Table three. -Twelve. -Okay. Hi. I'm James. Hi. Brooke. Amanda thought we would enjoy sitting together, since we have a lot in common. We do? You're a physical therapist, right? I'm an orthopedic surgeon. I keep you in business. And I appreciate that. Yeah. I mean, I do prefer to get my clients to a place where they don't have to see you in the first place, but, uh. Until they stop doing their exercises, re-injure themselves, and decide they want it fixed for real. Mm-hmm. I think I'm gonna have some bread. Uh... Just you know what? I gotta grab something. I'll be... right back. Why... Why can we not come to a wedding without somebody trying to set us up? I mean, I guess they just want us to be as happy as they are, but... Yeah. Well, it is not that easy. No! Not by a long shot. Mm-mm. I mean, I guess Greg and Ginny thought we would get along, but... Except, I didn't even want to meet you. I didn't want to meet anyone. -No. Yeah. -So. Yeah. I guess this whole wedding buddy thing then really worked out for us. Yeah. Absolutely. I-I wouldn't change a thing. No. Come on in. I'll show you around. I realized that you restored cars, but I didn't understand what an artform it is. Hello! Hi! Oh. Dan. Uh, this is Brooke. Oh. Brooke. The physical therapist? And wedding buddy. Really? Huh! Well, it's great to meet you, Brooke. And thank you so much for helping out old Nate. Actually, he won't let me help him at all. -What's wrong with you? -Go away, Dan. I have to get back to the office. I have some, uh, office-y things to do, but, uh, you two, take your time. Okay. Thanks, Dan. Oh! -You need to get an MRI. -It's not that bad. It's not getting any better either. I will look after it when the Mercedes is done. And the Rolls, if I get it. And then... maybe. Dan! Yep? What time does your garage open on Thursday morning? Nine. Great. I will see you at my house 7:30, Thursday morning. You are doing physical therapy, whether you like it or not. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Wait, why your house? Why not the clinic? Because I quit. I'm gonna open up my own office. That's incredible. Congratulations. Why didn't you say something? Um, because I'm still kind of processing it. And when I talk about it, I get nervous, and then I start questioning myself, and then I wonder if I've made a huge mistake. It's not a mistake. This is you taking charge of your own future. I'm happy for you. Thank you. I still have to get a loan and find a space. Ah. But in the meantime, I can see clients privately from home. Like you. Mm-hmm. Thursday... 7:30. I'll be there. What's wrong? Uh, Jim Fletcher got the Rolls job. You're kidding me. The guy uses new parts! It won't even be an authentic restoration. The car's owner doesn't want to wait months for everything to come in. The harder it is to find originals, the longer every other job takes. You don't have the turnover. Pretty soon... Can't keep everybody working. Something's got to change, Nate. You can't keep going like this. Or like that. Thank you, guys, for brunch. Oh, anytime, honey. You know, this really is a beautiful part of town. We should come here more. Oh, look. There's a space for rent. Is that so? Why, you know, this looks like the perfect location for a small medical office. Wow... Yeah, real subtle, guys. Did you take me out to brunch at the Pearl District to lure me here? "Lure?" Oh, no, that's a strong word. I think "happened upon, on purpose" is better. Do you know what I think this is? A fantastic investment opportunity. Do you guys seriously really want to invest? Of course we do. Thank you. I appreciate that, I do. I, um... I think this is something that I got to do on my own. Well... I can see that the "Summer of Brooke" is really doing you good. It is. You're looking at least ten grand. You can't be serious. Well, I can do a temporary repair for less, but this roof? It won't last long. Or I could just keep using the buckets. You could, but there's no guarantee it won't get worse. I'll just have to take my chances. Hang onto this just in case. Thank you. Nate. Hey. Hi! Is it not a good time? Oh, no. Oh, Brooke, I'm so sorry. I can't believe I'm using my "rainy day" fund for actual rain. What are you going to do? Buy bigger buckets. Hey, you don't have to work on my knee today. I can come back. No. No, it's okay. I'm really glad you're here. Me too. That should do it. Thank you for this. Hopefully, it'll get me through a whole round of golf. Well, a day at the spa sounds like way more fun. Oh, really? Agree to disagree. Oh. Hello? Oh. Uh... Okay. Well, will you be open by four? Okay. What's up? That was the country club. A tree fell on the power line and they're closed all day. Well, I guess that means golf is out, too. No, that's okay. I-I understand. Yeah, it is a lot of people, last minute. Okay. Thanks. Any luck? Nope. -Courses are all booked. -Same with the spas. Maybe we try to find something for everyone to do together. You mean, like, combine the parties? Yeah, it's called a "Jack and Jill." I went to one last year, we went to an escape room. It was a blast. I literally saw a couple break off their engagement after an hour in one of those, so... No escape room. Mm-hmm. Hang on. Outdoor activities, Portland, bachelor, bachelorette. You think they'll go for it? Only one way to find out. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... That's what I'm talking about! How's your knee holding up? You tell me. I'm coming for you. I'll be here. All right, blue team, look alive, here we go! I'm counting on you! One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... Oh! Oh! Yeah! Whoo! Well, your knee seems to be holding up... but you might want to get your arm checked out. Yeah, Edgar. Maybe stick to Foosball. Oh, be nice, sweetie. Always! Brooke, I'm having so much fun. Way better than a spa day. Not that it wasn't a good idea. It's way more fun, and I have to give Nate the credit. It was his idea. Nate, if I could have a second best man, that would be you. Yeah? You know what I mean. I'm open! I'm open! -Nate! -Ahh... You good? Yeah. -You okay? -I'm okay. I just slipped. All right. No! Let's get ice. Ice. Grab some ice. You can tell me how dumb I am for not fixing my knee. I'm not gonna tell you that, but promise me you'll come for physical therapy tomorrow. Definitely. Okay, sit here. Okay. Okay... Thank you. Yeah. Oh. They're watching us. Hey, you want to really mess with them? Sure. I think they bought it. It's pretty convincing. Yeah. Kind of even felt real. I should get back in the game. Ahem. Yeah. I guess I'll just stay here and... ice my knee. Yeah, just... and just put your hand right there. Okay. -Easy. Easy! -Oh, ho, ho, ho! Don't get excited. I was just messing with... We were messing with you! Oh, yeah. Sure. Brooke, you know, the best wedding present I could get would be to for you find true love. Okay. Hi there. This is Brooke Ethridge. Sorry to call so late, but, um... ...you were right, and I'm ready to fix the roof, so if you're still available this weekend, that would be great. Okay. I think it's the universe telling me I shouldn't go into business. Why? Why, why? Because I have to use the money for the loan to fix the roof. I am so sorry. What can I do? Nothing. But while you're here, I should get you that brace. Oh. Can't you just tape it up? Tape's not gonna cut it anymore. Hey. Do you remember, at Vicky and Amanda's wedding, we pulled in, there was a guy who loved the car? Mm-hmm? Well, he gave me his number, and he said, if you ever wanted to sell it, give him a call. I just texted him and he's interested. I mean, only if you are. Do you think he'll offer me enough to pay for the roof? I think, if I fix up the car for him... ...maybe. I can't pay you for that. Don't have to. We're bartering. You help me with the knee, I fix up the car. Well, then I guess it was meant to be. Okay. Just texted the guy. He's gonna be here in a couple minutes. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just, um... Don't want to get my hopes up. Well, I'll tell you this much... when you drove this thing in, Dan asked if could buy it, on the spot. You're gonna be okay. Okay. Is that your dad? Yep. It's sweet. He must be really proud of you. Yeah. I think he is. But, uh, business is changing. I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to keep running it the way he did. What about your parents? Also retired. Annoyingly happy. Yeah? You haven't seen two people more in love. Yeah. They have fun together. They laugh together. They're each other's biggest supporters. They're just... best friends. That's nice to hear. I haven't had a whole lot of luck in the marriage department. Oh, you were married? We were engaged for a year. And then... two months before the wedding, she told me that she hated Portland weather, and she wanted to move to Arizona to be closer to her family, and she had already gotten me a job, uh, managing the body shop at her father's car dealership. Ooh. Ooh... Yeah, well, for starters, you would've hated that job, so. See, you've only known me a month and you realize that. Kingston! -Hey! Good to see you. -Hey. There she is. I am so excited about this. So I'm thinking 10 grand for the car, and another 10 for the retro-mod? What's a "retro-mod"? Oh, uh, well, that's keeping a classic car old-looking on the outside, but fitting it with a modern engine, technology, air conditioning. It's, um, like a new car inside an old one. That sounds like a great idea. Yeah, well, there's a huge market. Yeah, it's not one of the services that I offer. Bummer. Maybe we can make an exception just this once. What? Yeah, I think you should do it. Just this once. -You're sure? -I am, yep. Thank you. So, 10,000 for the car? Well, uh, it's worth 11,500. 10,500. 11,000, all cash, and you have a deal. Done. I'm gonna go to the bank and be back in about an hour. Okay. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Thank you. That was impressive. My dad used to be a lawyer, he told me never to accept the first offer. Mm, that's too bad, because I was actually gonna offer you a ride to the rehearsal dinner. Oh. Well, maybe, for you, I'll have to make an exception. That's the story they love telling to embarrass us. Look who it is. We'll be right back, all right? Oh! Well, you two look nice. Thank you. And you both came together. Interesting. Yeah, we just thought it would be easier to take the same car. Better for the environment. Is that so? Yeah! I haven't seen you smile this much in years, Edgar. Probably because I'm thinking about the time in college, you tried to start a boy band. Lies! That's not a lie! Well, this changes everything! The wedding's off. Oh. I'm sorry, Nate. I didn't mean to bring up... It's okay. It's okay. First of all, we'd like to thank Greg's parents, Jim and Martha, for hosting today. Whoo! And... I want to thank my amazing fiancée, who's been working non-stop to make our wedding weekend absolutely perfect. I mean, she did all the heavy lifting. All I have to do is show up in a tux and say "I do." Thanks, Gin. To friends, family, and the future. Cheers. Cheers. Ginny! What's wrong? Why are you so upset? Because... you seem so happy that you didn't have to do any of the work. Is this how it's gonna be for the rest of our lives? Well, I would've helped more, but every time I suggested something, you shot it down. Oh, you mean like hiring a Metallica cover band to play at the reception? I wasn't being serious! That's the problem. You don't take of this seriously. Hey. You okay? I just completely lost it on Greg. What's wrong with me? Nothing. It is normal to have nerves the night before your entire life is about to change. He loves you, Ginny. He just wants you to be happy. That's all he's doing with these wedding plans. He wants you to have the wedding of your dreams. You're right. And now I messed it all up. He probably doesn't even want to marry me now. Of course he does. There is no one that belongs together more than you two. Except maybe you and Nate. I'm gonna go get Greg. Okay? Thanks, B. Yeah. I feel like, no matter what I say, I can't win. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe I'm not meant to be married after all. Yeah. Yeah, you should definitely go back to being single. Being single, you only have to think about yourself. You don't have somebody telling you what to do. It's freedom! I wouldn't give up being single again for anything... ...except what you and Ginny have. Come on, you guys are best friends. You make each other laugh. You're soulmates. And yeah, the stress got to her for a second... it's gonna happen. But now there's something you can to help. You can go back in there and you can tell her how much you love her. And that you can't wait to marry her. 'Cause I think we both know you can never do better. I really can't wait. Yeah. Good. Don't tell me. Go tell her. Okay? Okay, okay. Mwah. Well... looks like all is well. Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. I just have a lot of things to do before tomorrow. Maid-of-honor stuff. I can help. Uh, no thanks. I'm okay on my own. Okay. I mean, that's what this summer was supposed to be, right? Just letting myself be on my own... ...and I, uh, I haven't done that. I'm not doing that, so, um... What are you... What are you saying? I'm saying that... I'm really glad that we became wedding buddies... I just... I think that I should focus on my business now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, the summer was... but, you know, I gotta... I gotta focus on my... stuff. I mean, I'm sure you'll be fine. You have the whole "retro-mod" thing. Yeah, I just did it that one time. Just to sell your car. Yeah. What? Why do you do that? You're doing the same thing with your business that you do with your knee. I just don't understand why you won't do the thing that will make things better? I guess I just don't like people telling me what they think I need to do. Yeah. I know. Well, I mean, don't worry. One more day, and you won't have to hear it from me again. You'll be free. You ready? I am so ready. You look stunning. Thank you. Don't forget to bend your knees and keep your feet flat so you don't faint. I won't. Okay. I better get out there. -You're first. -Oh! You may kiss the bride. Whoo! Hey, look at you two. Finally hitting the big leagues, huh? -Yeah. -Yep. Well, when you two finally make it official, call me. Hey, you two! Hi. How's married life? So far, perfect. Hey, thanks for the awesome glasses. We'll have you two over for drinks sometime soon, okay? Sounds good. We should go find our table, but we will see you at the conga line. ♪ Mm-mm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm! There it is. Um, look, I know it's kind of hard right now, but I think we should just keep putting on happy faces. For Ginny and Greg. Why wouldn't we be happy? We had a lot of fun at the weddings, and now we're just moving on with our lives. Exactly. Um, we should go find our seats. Okay. Hi. I'm Brooke Ethridge and I have been best friends with Ginny since we the first day of seventh grade. Ginny once told me to look for someone you feel inspires you to write new stories with them. I asked her how she knew Greg was the one, and her answer was simple... she couldn't possibly imagine writing those stories without him. Greg and Ginny... ...here's to a life of love and happiness. To the beginning of your beautiful new story. To the bride and groom. To the bride and groom! Thank you. Be sure to get that MRI. Good luck with the clinic. Thank you. Bye. Okay. Bye. Oh, wow. Oh, this looks incredible. You've done an amazing job. You know, I gotta admit, it's kind of nice not having to worry about finding parts. Yeah? Well, guess what? It's even nicer not having to worry about finding new business. What do you mean? I got a list a mile long of these. Just say the word. Okay. Yes! Time to move on. Yes! And I just wanted to thank you all for coming to the grand opening of Ethridge Physical Therapy. Whoo-hoo! I am so proud of you. Thank you. I am proud of me, too. But something's missing. Right? Or someone? It just wasn't meant to be, Ginny. I still don't get it. You two were fine at the barbecue. What changed? I overheard him talking to you after your fight with Ginny. All he could say was how happy he was that his life was single, and that's fine. But that's all I needed to hear. Brooke. I say this as your best-friend-in-law... you messed up. I can't believe I pushed him away. I ruined everything. Then fix it. Go and talk to him. I blindsided him. Just like his fiancée. Why would he want to talk to me now? Hi... Hi. What are you doing here? You still have it? Come take a look. I made a little trade with Kingston. When I saw it again... I knew I couldn't let it go. It's perfect. It's still missing a pretty important part. A fuzzy seat-belt cover? This is why you came here? To show me the car? I heard that you fix people who are in pain. Your knee? I'm so sorry, Nate. I overheard you talking to Greg about how happy you were being single and free and I thought I had to let you go. What about all the other stuff that I said? I only found out about that today. I am sorry for pushing you away. All this time. I... I didn't know. It's a good thing we know how to put things back together. If you want to... I love you. Congrats, man. You did it, Edgar!
