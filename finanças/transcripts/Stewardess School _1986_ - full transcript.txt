Sit down, George! Well, you don't understand. You have to come to this party. I don't think you're fully aware of the gravity of the situation. All right, I'll go. Just sit down! Or I'll lie down.

Girls, I'm hurt. I'm genuinely hurt. Has George Bunkle ever lied to you? BOTH: What about the Michael Jackson party? Hey, he was very insulted that you didn't believe it was him that night. BOTH: Five minutes, Bunkle. Talk about your boring parties. What else would you expect from anyone who lives in this building? (FARTING LOUDLY) (ALL COUGHING) (COUGHING) Man, I gotta lay off that pork fried rice. (GROANING) Philo. Philo? Yo, Philo. Hello? Philo? Philo? Where the hell are you? (GASPS) What are you trying to do, put me in an early grave? I'm okay. (GROWLING) You idiot! You've ruined my whole life! (STRAINING) It's not my fault you wear glasses. (PANTS) No. It's my fault. (BONES CRACKING) Come on, Philo, get a grip on yourself. Everybody has their limitations. Shit, even me. Let's just calmly examine the situation. Now, what have we got? We got two bright, enterprising young men like ourselves? You kidding? There's a million things we can do. Give me a break, George. It's all over for me. All right, all right. I'll admit things may look a trifle dark right now. But, so what? Besides, you know me. Don't I always come up with something? All my life all I ever wanted to do was fly. (SCREAMING) (PHILO CRASHING) Philo? Oh, there you are. Philo! I've got it. Wait till you hear this idea. This is it. What happened here? If I ever see you again, George, it's gonna be too soon. No, no, no, you're gonna love this. You ready? Stewardess school. You're totally certifiable, George, and I'm gonna sign the papers! What a great idea. Think of it, Philo. (EXCLAIMS) Breakfast in Paris. Dinner in Rome. Not to mention all the incredible women we're gonna meet. (LOUD CHEWING) Mr. Pellino. Call me Snake. Mr. Snake.

I think better when I'm flying. Right. GEORGE: So we go to stew school. We graduat Then you can flyh yo little heart out. Maybe you'll get this obse. I suppose you'reight, George. You know, for a while there I thought that you just wanted to go to stew school just so you could meet women. Please, give me some credit. There's a little more to life than women. Very little. (BOTH LAUGHING) There it is. That's the Philo I know and love. You idiot! So, what's the verdict? Why don't you go park this boat and I'll get us a room with a view. Now you're talking, dude. All right. I'm not a jinx, I'm not a jinx, I'm not a jinx. Yeah, and I'm not in this for my health, lady. That's $14.75 with the toll. Keep the change. Oh, thanks, sport. I'll get your luggage.

Why, don't you think I can do it myself? Hey, no problem. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) I'm sorry. (GROANS IN DISCOMFORT) (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Good morning. Morning. I certainly am glad your father's not alive to see what you've turned his school into. What I have turned the old codger's school into is a profitable institution. Oh, yes, by lowering the standards so that anybody could get in. All right, sugar. Here we are. Jesus, Harry, stewardess school? Is that the best you could do for me? Hey, sugar, I'm your probation officer, not employment agent. Listen, sugar, this is a real opportunity for you to change your whole life around. Yeah, yeah, sure, Harry. I'm agog with anticipation. (SIGHS) So how long am I in for anyway? You are enrolled for four weeks. Then you can get a job on an airline. Gee. I've never done it on an airplane before. Now, look, I'm warning you, if they catch you turning one more trick, they gonna put your behind away for a long, long time. Yeah, yeah. Well, so long, Harry. Don't take any wooden pickles. (CHUCKLING) Hi. Am I the only boy? Let's see. (CHECK IN LADY SCREAMING) Cindy Adams. Room 12, second floor. (WOMAN SCREAMING) I'm gonna miss you. (BURPS LOUDLY) (SCREAMING) Hi, I'm Pimmie Polk. Hi. Jolean Winters. And this is my mother, and my grandmother. Hello! Hello! Hello. It's nice to meet you. This is a big day for the Polk family. Oh, really? Three generations of stews. (LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY) No kidding. ¶ We'll wine you We'll dine you ¶ We'll fly you to the skies ¶ (GIGGLES) Well, good afternoon. My name is Ms. Grummet, and I will be supervising all of your activities while you are here with us. I expect strict compliance with the rules. But before I get into those rules and lists, I would like to take this opportunity to introduce our chancellor, Mr. Weidermeyer. He will giving a brief, ten minute welcoming address. Mr. Weidermeyer? (APPLAUSE) Good afternoon. You certainly are a fine looking group. Welcome to the Weidermeyer Academy. This academy was sired by... Founded by my father in 1949 and we have a long and impressive list of graduates. As you can see from the people seated behind me, we offer the finest in flight instruction training. And you can be assured... (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) We will never nipple and dime... (ALL CHUCKLING) Nickle and dime you on your education. Your instructors are firm but fair. If you get a little behind in your work, they won't be hard on you. (WEIDERMEYER CLEARS THROAT) (SPEAKS GIBBERISH) Well, I guess that's about it from old Roger Weidermeyer. So, once again, welcome. Ms. Grummet. (APPLAUSE) I'll just stand here till you're finished. That's disgusting. Now, if you'll all pay attention to the following rules, I'm sure we'll all get along just fine. Mmm. Just like Mom never made. $3.50. That's very reasonable considering your gourmet selection. Thank you. Roommate, shall we? Yes. Whoa. Hi. Oh! Oh, God. Ow! Oh, God. Please. Please sit. Are you sure? I live for danger. Okay. Uh, Kelly Johnson, resident klutz. Philo Henderson, unfulfilled dreamer. Ugh. So, what was the final headcount? Forty six. Excellent. That makes nine more students than last time. Yes, and I can tell you just which nine they are. Relax, Ms. Grummet. You will be able to start weeding them out soon enough. (CHUCKLES) (ALARM RINGING) Oh! George! George, wake up! There's a fire. George! (SNORING) Philo, you gotta do something about that alarm clock. Get up, George. There's a fire. What? Fire! Fire! Fire! (ALARM RINGING LOUDLY) (GIRLS CLAMORING) (ALARM STOPS) Good morning, my little chickens. Welcome to stewardess school. Now, to begin with, I would like to make one thing perfectly clear. To be a stewardess means to be on call 24 hours a day. That means you must be in top physical condition at all times, and bright and alert. Because if you miss one call to duty, you will be... Dismissed! Now, grab your sweats and report to the compound in five minutes. Five minutes! Let's move it, move it, move it! Move it, Bunkle. (BLOWS WHISTLE) All right. We'll start this morning and every morning with a little five mile up Fort Valley Hill. Dubois, Winters report to the doctor's office for physical. The rest of you move out. (BLOWS WHISTLE) Good luck, chubby. Thanks. Move it, move it, move it! (CLEARS THROAT) Hi. We're here for our physicals. Names? Sugar Dubois and Jolean Winters. Have a seat. I'm on a diet, I've lost eight pounds. I'm sure the doctor will take that into consideration. I think you look terrific. You do? Yeah, sure. (PHONE BUZZES) Who am I kidding? He's gonna flunk me. You mean if you don't pass this physical they could kick you out of here? That's right. I'll be history. Yeah. You can go in now, Ms. Dubois. Good luck. Thanks. With you in a moment. Do you want me to take my clothes off? Well, I don't think that would be a bad idea. Gosh, hope you don't have cold hands. Come on, let's move it, move it, move it! Only two more miles to the top! That is not a pleasant woman. (DOOR OPENS) You can go in now, Winters. Doctor? (MUMBLES) Sit. (SIGHS) (EXHALES) (PUMPING SOUND) Holy shit! Doctor Mackie? What aut me? Yo My physical? You passed! I passed? Go. I passed! Bitch. Those are, uh, really thick glasses. On a clear day I can see Moscow. Oh, God, it must be tough to get around without these things. Well, I've developed an acute sense of touch. (KNOCKING) Philo! Wait. (ALL YELLING) It's okay, it's okay. He's totally blind without his glasses. It's Kelly. Hi. Hi, come on. Right this way. Here you go. You okay? Great. Thanks. (GASPS) (SCATTING) Communal showers. That's amazing. How would I know that? Hey, girls, what's shaking? (ALL SCREAMING) What? What? What? (EXCLAIMS) And stay out! To fly, to soar with the eagles. To pilot this magnificent machine high above the earth. To be in total control of the lives and destinies of hundreds of people. God forgive me, I do love it so. Now, where was I? ALL: To fly, to soar with the eagles. To fly... Whoever wants pizza comes to Larry's room. Want some? No thanks, I'm on a diet. I just came to sniff. Oh, George can always tell a good wine by the twist of a cap, I swear to God. Pepperoni. Okay. Okay, everybody, a toast. To a bright new future in the airline industry! What's the matter? Everybody's future doesn't look as bright as yours. You're not a klutz. Yeah, and you're slim and attractive. And you always seem to know what to do. You actually seem to like this bullshit. I know you all think that I'm pretty and pert, and kind of terrific. But you know, sometimes when people are getting to know me, for some strange reason they wanna choke me. (GIGGLING) Come on, it's not as bad as all that. It's always darkest before the dawn. When the going gets tough the tough get going. Yeah, when in doubt whip it out. PHILO: George. Figure of speech. (SNORTING) Now, behind this curtain we have assembled a group of professional passengers. That is passengers who will test your skill at dealing with common but difficult situations. Oh, yes, uh, I will be observing and grading your conduct accordingly. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. The whiskey goes next to the vodka. I am so nervous. I just know I'm gonna screw up. Hey, relax. After all, what are they gonna do, bite us? Hot towel, madam? (GROWLING) Now, Poofy, don't you be a naughty girl. I'm sorry, madam, but you'll have to put your Poofy in the box. Aw. Perhaps you'd do it for me. (SNARLING) What are you, high, lady? Please? (BARKING) Perhaps later, after she's had her nap. Pillow, Poofy? (SNARLING) Maybe not. Later. (BARKING) And what can I get our little man for dessert? A hot fudge sundae. Ooh. That sounds delish. Would you like whipped cream on top? Yup. And sprinkles? Yup. And a cherry on top? Yup. And how would you like your nuts crushed? How would you like your tits shot off? Uh... (EXCLAIMS) Something to drink? I know you. You're Bubba Brock, fullback for the Broncos. I got cut. Oh, I'm sorry. Injury? No. Bad attitude, ass breath. Excuse me, young man. I need your help. Yes, madam. My seatbelt is stuck. Oh. Oh, yes, I think I see the problem. If you'd care to stand up a minute. I didn't pay to stand in the aisle. I paid to sit down. Okay. (GROANS) Oh. Oh, Miss. Yes, sir? I'd like a scotch and water, please. I have to begin in the rear of the aircraft but I'll be right back to serve your drink. (GASPS) I think I got it. (GASPS) Excuse me, sir. The captain does have the no smoking light on. Well, I'll just run back and turn that little light off. Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has informed me that we're ready to land. Please put your trays up, and your seats in the upright position. Thank you. And I hope you've all been well serviced. Hey, you! Tray up, seat back, and loose that cigarette. Yes, ma'am. Miss... Polanski. Polanski, yes. Hi. I think your delivery needs a little work. Try not to be so firm. With the passengers, not so direct. Not so firm and not so direct. Right. Yoo-hoo. Wake up, wake up. (GASPS) (GROANING) Much better. (ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSIC PLAYING) George. What? Do me a favor. Sleep on the fire escape tonight. It's the old multiple cologne trick. Keeps 'em off their guard. He's kinda cute. I think he's gonna ask me out. Hi. You wanna play hide the salami? Gross. I guess a blow job's out of the question. WANDA: What do we do now? I know. How about a game of trivia? I hate trivia. Get out of here. Me, too. What's the problem? Well, there's a party we all wanna go to but we've got no way to get there. How bad do you wanna go? On a scale of one to ten? Pretty bad. (SCREAMING) Yahoo! (ALL WHOOPING) Oh, look who's here. Yes, yes. Kent Arnold. I'd like you to meet my fiance, Alison Hanover. The Hanovers of Greenwich. How do you do? South Port. Top draw, DF. Much. (CHUCKLES) (MOTORCYCLES REVVING) What in blazes is going on here? Kent, check that, will you? Pimmie? Kent. Let me introduce everybody. This is Jolean, Wanda, Cindy, and these are our chaperones for the evening. Snake, Scuzzball, River Rat, and Bones. Pimmie, I'm sorry, but they can't come in. Cindy? Cindy Adams? Hello, Kent. Breath mint? Quaalude. You got a Twisted Sister? No, but my cousin Lonaur is a little strange. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC STOPS) (POP MUSIC PLAYING) All right! Kent, what is the meaning of that neanderthal invasion? It's Cindy Adams. Her father is chairman of the board of the stock exchange. Mmm. Excuse me, muffin, I'll be right back. Miss Adams. I'm Dudl Farnsworth. Buzzff, needle dick. Oh, muffin. All right. What is this shit? Fruit punch. Tastes like panther piss. All right. Everybody drink up. I said drink party! (ALL SCREAMING) How did you find this place? Oh, one of the local kids told me about it. It's spectacular. Look. It's been a long time since I kissed a boy in the front seat of a car. It's been a long time since I kissed a boy, period. I think it's my sworn duty to make up for all those lost kisses. Oh, Philo. No, no, no, no. The hook's in front. (KELLY MOANING) Oh, Philo. Sorry about that. It's hormonal. I guess it's in my jeans. I'll say it is. (LOUD MUSIC PLAYING) Wanna dance, mama? Fine. This ought to be interesting. Would anyone care for a cheese snack? You're real good, baby. I know. Oh, that's some set of muffins, eh, Snake? (GROWLING) Beer! (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (MUFFLED GROANING) What? Uh, nothing. Now tomorrow, we'll be dealing with volume two in my trilogy, 101 More Ways to Make Your Passengers Feel Really, Really Safe. After all, don't you feel better when you feel safe? I know I do. (CHUCKLES) Class! This morning I'm going to give you a little lesson on how to deal with terrorists. Of course, one of the main weapons in dealing with these swarthy types is surprise! (SCREAMING) (GROANING) I took a course. What you're about to go through is a simulated ditch drill. You will be given exactly three minutes to get the passengers off the plane, down the chute and into the life raft to safety. Wake up, Harpo. Time is of the essence here. If you don't have those people off this plane in exactly three minutes, well, you've all flunked the exercise. PIMMIE: Ladies and gentlemen, please prepare to exit the rear of the plane as quickly as possible. Our flight attendants will assist you in any way you need. (ALL CLAMORING) Just move to the back of the plane quietly. Thank you. Keep it going. Come on. (WHOOPING) (BOTH LAUGHING) Bye. Please, we'll have to exit immediately. This is an emergency. Darling, we did not pay for first class tickets to slide down a moldy chute into a raft. I can't go without my rubber ducky. (ALL LAUGHING) Follow me! Row! Row! I love this. Lot of good stuff. Row! (PASSENGERS LAUGHING) Ninety seconds left. But, they won't budge. You're not going to make it. What's the problem? Beat me, whip me, make me write bad checks, but please join us for a glass of bubbly. (ALL LAUGHING) Go on, I'll take care of this. Okay, I'm gonna check the galley, I'll be right behind you. Check. (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (ALL CHEERING) PHILO: We did it! (ALL CHEERING) Wait a minute. Where's Jolean? ALL: Jolean? Geronimo! This is a very healthy kill list, even for you. Well, if there's nothing else I'd like to get on with it. (PHONE BUZZING) Yes. SECRETARY: Sir. Mr. Stromboli would like to know if you'd be much longer. He has a plane to catch. Ask Mr. Stromboli to come in, please. Roger, how are you? Last time I saw you why, you were this high. I've grown. Won't you sit down? Thank you very much. Well, what can I do for you? The thing is that now I have this government inspection coming around and if I don't get high grades in all areas of passenger service they're gonna pull the rug from under me, Roger. I'll be out of business. Do I take it that you would like me to provide you with a top flight crew from our graduating class? Exactly, Roger. Yes! If I can pass the inspection, then I can add another flight at the end of the year, and this way I can give the competition a run for their money. Shall we say 500 bucks a head? 500? That's blackmail! It was nice seeing you again, Carl. Now, if you'll excuse me I'm really awfully busy. Roger, I can give you 250. That is all I have. 350, and not a penny less! But, I'll throw in a pilot. And so, it is with great pleasure that as of, um, 10:15 this morning, you are all... (PHONE BUZZING) Grummet! Yes. What? That's ridiculous. I strongly protest. No way. Perhaps you'd like to stop by my office and discuss an early retirement? You wouldn't put me on the beach, would you? Let me say once again how very proud I am of all of you. This has been a record year for student placements in the airline industry. If you will check the announcement board in the main hall later, we will have posted the names of the various airlines and of the students they have invited to come fly with them. In conclusion, I would just like to leave you with one thought. (MAN SNORING) Remember, when you go out there, you are representing the Weidermeyer Academy. So whatever you do, do it with dignity. (BLOWS RASPBERRY) Thank you. Here we go. Breakfast in Paris. Dinner in Rome. Dinner in Rome. All right, dude. Here we go. TWA. Pan-Am. Stromboli Airlines? (CHUCKLING) Well... (GROANS) Mmm. Well, you get what you paid for. Hey, come on. I mean, it's not as bad as it all seems. Yeah, Philo's right. Grummet made us all feel like we were no good. Well, she's wrong! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, but none of you were terminally clumsy. I am. (WHISPERING) She's under. That's amazing. Could you make her bark like a seal while I pretend to give her a fish? George. What? Kelly Johnson. Yes. You are the most graceful person on earth. I am? Yes. Of course I am. You have the skill of a ballerina, the hands of a surgeon, the dexterity of a Japanese sushi chef. Now, when I snap my fingers you will wake up feeling like the great new person you are. This place looks a lot like the Bates Motel. Welcome. Welcome. I am Carl Stromboli, I own the place. The driver will take care of your luggage, so please do follow me. Thank you. So nice to see you. Very happy to see you. Sorry about the lights being off, but I have to cut down on expenses anywhere I can to keep the airline going. This way, please. Oh, wow. CARL: After you. Oh, my, look at this. Hey. Don't stand on ceremonies, sit down. Come on, make yourself at home. This is really nice. Thank you, but it's my wife Sarah. She's the one with the good taste in the family. Oh, ladies and gentlemen, please I want you to say hello to my dear wife Sarah. ALL: Hi, Sarah. Wow. Real food. (CHUCKLES) First eat, we'll get to know each other later. That's right. Now, don't be shy. Dig in, come on. Come on, come on, let's eat. Oh, fuck it. Corn. Corn. Thank you. And some potatoes. So you can see why this next flight is so important for me. Every nickle I have is tied up in this plane. And every nickle I don't have. What am I worried? I've got the best crew around. Really? When can we meet them? Huh? George, he's talking about us. Well, one thing's for sure Mr. Stromboli, we'll make certain that the FAA inspector is happy. Yeah, that's good, but you see, we'll never know who it is. We never do. It could be anyone on the plane. It could be a man, a woman. Sometimes they even use a professional passenger from your school. I'm not worried. You know why? Because you are the ones who graduated in the first of the class. And tomorrow's run will be a snap for you. ALL: Tomorrow? Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Stromboli Airlines Flight 106, non stop to Atlanta. We are now ready to board. For those passengers needing special assistance you may now step forward at this time, please. Thank you. Go to your right. She'll help you. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) KELLY: Easy does it. There you go. Hi. Right this way. This way, sir. Let me help you. Ow! Have a... Have a good flight. Hi. Oh, oh, oh. Allow me, sir. Take your hands off me, you fool! (GROANING) Pain. Major pain. JOLEAN: Passengers seated in rows 17 to 26, you may now board the plane. George, what are you doing? There's blind people walking all over the plane. Special observer from the academy. I know the way. Terrific. Friend of yours? You married? Oh, yeah. You? No, no, no. Captain Biff likes to keep his runways clear. Morning. Morning. Oh, morning. Hi, doll. Captain Biff? You're our pilot? That's right. Are you impressed? Here we go, George. Close her up. You got it. Fasten your seatbelt. What are you, blind? What? Hmm? Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten your seatbelts and put your chairs back for take off. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. Atlanta Traffic Control informs me we'll be having some adverse weather condition en route, so, we'll be flying at 35, 000 feet today to avoid most of the turbulence. Thank you. You must be used to flying through storms, huh, Captain? Storms? This is just great. What's Grummet doing on board? I thought we were through with her. According to the manual, she's allowed to come on the first flight as an observer, and file a report with the FAA. Terrific. Whoa. Shit. Veal and water. Veal and water. Thank you. Here you are, sir, your veal and water. Thank you very much. Could I have some peanut, too, please? Yes. Thank you very much. May I put that some place for you, sir? Don't touch that! It's a present for my mother. It's very fragile. Oh, of course, sir. I understand. Ladies and gentlemen, for the safety and convenience of our unsighted passengers we will ring our cabin bell twice when the seatbelt sign is on and once when it is off. Thank you. Where's my drink? (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Coming right up, sir. Well, be quick about it. Yes, sir. Whatever you say. (YAWNS) Oh, could I take that for you, sir? Thank you, yes. Okay. And your glass? There we are. (SIGHS) (RIPS TAPE) (LIGHTNING CRASHING) (WIND HOWLING) Looks like we're in for a pretty good storm. Yeah, even at this altitude we're gonna hit a lot of turbulence. (COUGHS) Are you okay? My contacts! (LENS CRACKING) (KNOCKING) Let me help you. (BEEPS) (CLOCK TICKING) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Sit right here. You're no good to us if you can't see. (LIGHTNING CRASHES) Are you all right? (PANTING) I feel strange. Like this is all a dream. You mean a nightmare. (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) (GASPING) What are you most afraid of? Confinement. Closed spaces. It's awful tight in here. Isn't it? (LAUGHING) (SCREAMS) Something's wrong with him. I need air! I need air! Sit down! It's okay. What is this guy's problem? I don't know. (SCREAMING) The passengers are getting really upset. What are we gonna do? We cannot spend the rest of the flight like this. (PASSENGER YELLS) Trouble? Eat it, prune face! (SCREAMS) (SHUSHING) There's gotta be some way to calm him down. Step aside. Oh, my God, they're in your nose! (GASPS) (TICKING) (GIGGLING) (GASPS) (PASSENGER GASPING) (SHRIEKS) (RELIEVED SIGH) Okay. Okay. Okay. (LIGHTNING CRASHES) Blow job is two words. Gee, uh, I didn't think it'd be this rough way up here. Is that normal? Don't know. This is my first flight, Captain. Oh, yeah, right. (TERRORIST LAUGHING) All right! Turn around real slow! Snappy coat... Shut up! Keep your hands where I can see 'em. (GROANING LOUDLY) Oh, boy. (GROANING) All right, fish face! Put it on automatic pilot! Um, we can't do that at this altitude. We can't? Oh, yes. Yes, we can. We can do anything. Only please, please don't shoot me. Do it now! Okay. Automatic. No hands. Ah! I want you all to know that I've got enough here to hang you and put an end to Stromboli Airlines. I'm taking my report to the captain right now. Blow it out your ass! (GASPS) I just think I'll add that to my report. (LIGHTNING CRASHES) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (TOILET FLUSHES) (GRUMMET SCREAMING) (ALL GROANING) PHILO: Holy moly! (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) GRUMMET: Oh, my God! Okay. Okay. (SCREAMS) (GASPS) No. I didn't do anything. I was good. Is this gonna hurt? It is, isn't it? Is it? (GAS HISSING) (INCREASES PRESSURE) (INHALES DEEPLY) (INHALES DEEPLY) I hope you guys like cherries on your sun... (SCREAMING) (BEEPING) (WIND HOWLING) (SCREAMS) Here, sit down. What the... What happened here? I smell ether. She's breathing. He's alive! What's the switchboard on the altimeter say? It says "auto". Good. All right, let's get these people outta here. I did a quick head count, and the guy in 30C is missing. He must've jumped. Who would jump out of a plane at 40, 000 feet? The guy in 30C. All right. I want you to start searching the plane quickly and quietly without alarming the passengers. What are we looking for? Unless I miss my guess, a bomb. That's amazing. I knew you were gonna say that. George! I'm gone. What do you think? Well, I think we'll be okay for a while on autopilot. Wait. Where are we supposed to look? I don't know. How about if we start at the back of the plane and work our way up? Good idea. Whoa! (BOMB TICKING) What the hell's going on here? Not now, Mr. Buttersworth. I'll get to the bottom of this. Who's there? Are you the pilot? Yeah. Are you a passenger? Yes! And I demand to know what's going on here! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Thanks. MAN: What is that thing? Portable microwave. What did he say? Doesn't anybody know anything about bombs? You got a bobby pin? Yeah. No! Move over, Kojak. Somebody quick, get me some tools. Everybody else secure the passengers and move forward. Check. Rule 47... ALL: Keep smiling. Holy shit! I hope you're in a good mood. (LIGHTNING CRASHING) Apparently not. (ALL CLAMORING) (BOMB TICKING) I'm a little slow. George! Sorry, I'm new to this. (LIGHTNING CRASHING) (GEORGE SHUSHING) Now the problem is if I cut the wrong wire, this thing could go off in our faces. Philo! Strap him in! What the hell kind of airline is this? Okay. (JULEAN WHIMPERING) Here goes. I'll get it. (JULEAN GRUNTING) (SQUEALS) You did it! (LAUGHS) It was nothing. (BEEPS) (FAST TICKING) You didn't do it. I think it's time for plan B. Plan B? Run away! Oh! Oh! (SCREAMING) Jolean! Are you all right? It's raining out. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Oh, man, I need a drink. Can I get you something? Forget it. Captain, pressure's back to normal. Everyone's okay. Now if I can only see I can land this baby on a dime! Wait a minute. He can't see either? No! I'm taking over! (ALL SCREAMING) No, Mr. Buttersworth! Listen, I wore glasses. You wanna try them? No, I got this weird astigmatism called binocular vision. Wait! Hey, here. Try these. No. No, they're no good. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, turn them around. Here. That's it! That's it, strap it to my head! We're going home! (ALL CHEERING) (ALL WHOOPING) Now it's all up to the FAA inspector who was on board. Will the bailiff please call the final witness? They're ready for you. Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? I do. Sir, would you please share with us your impressions of what happened on Flight 106 to Atlanta? Frankly, it was the best flight I ever had. Case dismissed. (ALL CHEERING) (GROANING) It's amazing. I knew he was gonna say that.
