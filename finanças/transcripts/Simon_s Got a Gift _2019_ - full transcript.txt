Hello. Can I have cotton candy? We are closed. Please. Two euros. Over money? ORPHANAGE good morning. - Good morning. - Miss gatron, I'm the manager here. The kids are almost ready. Stop. Don't run away, come here... - Who stole my 20 euros? - Save it well for next time. Who are you? Yassin, come here! Never mind, Simon. You're too ugly to be adopted. Kevin. What's happening in here? I'm just defending myself. Defend yourself elsewhere. Wait, yassin! Jeremy, no running! Take it slow! Wait before boarding the boat. I said no, no, no, stop, stop. Wait me. Hello. My name is Simon. They almost got me. My mother is looking for you. Give me cake hello. This is Simon. Do you like alright. Be careful, it's very powerful. If god. It is astringent. - Do you live in the city? - No. I come from the orphanage. Did your parents die? I do not know. So how are you there I only know that they found me at the gate of the orphanage when I was a baby. I am allergic to potatoes. It's no worse than being an orphan, but... ...I can't eat french fries. This is bad. Do you like - I made it. - Hurray! What do you want to be when you grow up? I want to be an astronaut and see space. Fantastic! I also want to work in my father's mirror shop. They're under here. Madeline? Thomas? - Where are they? - I don't know either. - Did you look under the table? - Under the table? Maybe I found something. Hurry up. Come on, or they'll catch us. - Here it is! - Help me! - Thomas, no! - Do not give up my hand! Cream puffs, where are these cream puffs? Where? Where is it? Simon? Will you come a little? Did you have a good day? Yes. I heard you made yourself new friends. Yes. Thomas. - She has a potato allergy. - This is not pleasant. Yes. I spoke to Thomas' father, Jacques durant. He said his son wants you to spend the weekend with them. Really? Yes really. Shall I call them to say you agree? You go to bed. - Hi Simon. - Hello. Dad, can you put your things in my room? Let me show you the garden. Mad? Help set the table. Thomas, get the napkins. Where are the napkins? In the fridge with your slippers. - Here they are, mom. - Thank you. Silly! Simon. Can you help too? Simon, you sit here, next to me. - Do you like fish? - Yeah, I love it. I made you one of my specials. But it's too early mom, the kids are still playing. No, they're getting ready for bed. Now reach out and unbutton. Will you stop fidgeting? Don't move, it's almost over. Stop, don't. What do I do. I love you. Plug. Sweet dreams. Look what I found. You can do whatever you want. Some have astronauts or something. So you can learn everything. Here you go. The library is closed. But it had just opened. No arguments, right to bed. Come on, Simon. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. No noise, go to sleep now. Goodnight. Goodnight. Madeleine, help Simon. Happy birthday! But we weren't going to say it now. Sometimes we move early. Ok. - Frog? - Rabbit? - A rabbit? - Kangaroo? - Thomas! - Are you serious? What's going on here? Take this. The heaviest. Thank you. So that's it? Two against one... Where did you get it? We bought it from a store with a lot of fabric. It was all very nice, my mom and dad bought a lot. Ok, be quiet. The reason for tonight's meeting... ...there is a very important issue, we will talk about it. Simon? Do you want to be our blood brother? What should I do? First we'll mix our blood... ...then we will share and promise our biggest secret. Then we will be brothers for life. - Ok. - Do you agree, mad? Shouldn't we join hands? It's not necessary. I don't want to get sick. But that works too. I had searched the internet. Yes, this is ok. Take this, band-aid. Ok. And now it's the turn of the secret. This should definitely stay between us, it's very important. I saw my mother naked once. But he doesn't know about it. It's your turn, mad. I do not have many friends. In fact, there isn't even one. But it's not a secret, everyone already knows that. You should say something else. - But I don't know if you don't have a secret. - Of course I have a secret. Then tell me. Come on or you can't be simon's blood brother. According to my parents, I would not live more than 20 years. And you? I'm not so sure. Don't be afraid if I tell you. Ok. Now I'm going to show you something that I haven't shown anyone. Why? But you have to promise me. Although this may seem strange to you, our blood brotherhood will continue. I promise. I promise too. That's it. Can you show this again? You can masquerade as anyone, even the head of state. No, just the people I touched. You weren't afraid, were you? No, and that's a great thing. And look. When he changed, the scar disappeared as well. A minute. It means you are immortal. I don't know, maybe. You should still pretend to be cut off... ...or no one will believe that we are blood brothers. So, can you turn yourself into an animal too? Will you do this? I don't know, I don't think so, I've never tried that. Are you trying right now? Yes, but it didn't work. But would you turn into someone else again? Again, again! Shall I wake your mom and dad? Are you hurting? Something terrible. Very scary. Be patient until it passes. It will surely pass. - Look, my mom bought two. - Thank you. Pink but it suits you. - But it's a girl's raincoat. - Not at all. I liked it. You both look so great. Be home for lunch. Okay? Maybe you are from another planet. When you become an astronaut, you come back. But I don't want to go back. It can be yours. You dig a tunnel to escape from the house. Thank you. You can come to see me whenever you want. Are you ready? Lets start! That doesn't count, but that's unfair! Simon, stop! It's not funny! Simon! We can't run like this! Simon! Thomas? Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! - Thomas! - Simon! - Thomas! - Simon! Thomas! Thomas! Simon! Thomas! Thomas where are you? Thomas? Thomas? Thomas? Thomas? Thomas? Thomas? Thomas? Thomas? Mom. Come sweety. Thomas! Where is Simon? I just spoke to the orphanage, they were informed. A new search party will continue the search. That area will be searched. By the way, Thomas, can you tell us what's going on? We were racing in the woods. Then I heard you shout. I called out to him, but he didn't answer. I searched everywhere but couldn't find it. Do you remember where you last saw him in the woods? Can you take us there? No, we went too far and got lost, it was my fault. He was very scared, but I didn't listen to him and kept running. I shouldn't have done this. I am really sad. Thank you. Let's continue the search. - I'm coming too. - It's not necessary. You'd better rest. Stay with your son. Thomas? Is that really you? Yes. You shouldn't eat them raw. Look, you have to eat the well-cooked ones. Not possible, sorry. Then eat beans. Maybe, but only once a month. No. Quite the opposite Madeleine. Junk food just once a month and fruit every day. I misunderstood again. Your face doesn't say good things. You must be very careful, Madeleine. You're not the only one on the list. Incompatibility is not a good thing. So everything is bad. Jacques durant mirror - good morning. - Good morning. I've come to take my order. - Yes of course. My god! Damn! What was the name? Was Thomas here? Yes. Certainly. Thomas? Thomas? - Yes? - Can you come? Did you hear me? I'm coming. - Ready. - Thank you. Will you sign here? What are you doing on vacation? I am working. Every time? Normally yes. Ok. Then goodbye. Bye. - Isn't it over yet? - Okay I am coming. What is this? It is good for allergies. Thank you. With your permission. J. Durant and son I made it to hang at the entrance of the shop. We do better when we're rich. Is dad still messing with you? No, he made another surprise. Is that why you're hiding? He would have already given it to you. Did you know? Of course. Almost everyone knew this. He has planned 45 years of his life, which is great. Yes. Why don't you tell him? Are you afraid of upset? I guess I don't know what I want. My friends, my children and my beloved wife. In the durant family tradition... ...when a family member steps into adulthood, photos are made... ...and we make fun of the birthday boy. Come on guys, get over here right now. Your father spent the whole day scanning photos. He's been dealing with this all day, now please sit down... ...and watch the slide show. Thank you sweetie. Didn't you sort the photos? I thought you did. Here is thomas's life, the order does not matter at all. Workshop renovations. It's at the sea festival. The same day. Is this thomas's or Jacques' slide show? I'm not in every photo. I used to work 15 hours, mama for your money. That's when we told him he was going to have a sister. Things changed a bit when he was born. Then they never parted. Could you go a little faster please? First motor lesson. Look how skilled he is. Is it a gift? No, for myself. Goodbye, ma'am. Best fried fries 150 meters further here's your fries. Mine. You can enter. What happened? - May I ask you something? - Of course. When Simon disappeared... ...that he may have gone... ...have you ever thought of it? He could have escaped. No. We never found it. Because he drowned in the ocean. - We don't know that. Why did you ask this? I think I saw him today. Look. Doesn't she look like him? No, it doesn't. Look. Look good. No, I do not think so. - Well, you didn't even look at the photo. - I don't need to look. He's dead! If you see this man please call me ma'am, have you seen this man? - No I did not see. - Have a nice day. Did you see it? Extra large fries. Hello. Have we met before? I do not think so. Aren't you Simon? No. I won't tell anyone. I am sad. Excuse me. I'm sure we've met before. Are you okay? Is there anything I can do? You can say your name. It doesn't make me breathe, but it makes me happy. Michelle. What is that? Didn't you like it? Mine is bad Madeleine too. You could say mad. It means crazy in English. - Do you still want potatoes? - Yes. Are you okay young lady? I can call the doctor if you want. I'm fine thank you. She is 18 years old but calls me young lady. You are very strange. How? While the thought of you being someone else is killing me... ...you are sitting comfortably eating your french fries. I do not know. This doesn't interest me much. On my face... ...did you see something? - No. You are just so beautiful. They're looking for me. I have to go. Where are you? Dinner is ready I am on my way ll see. You're not bad either. If we get the fun house job, that'd be really cool. Who knows how many mirrors they will order? A dozen? It's a huge labyrinth. I don't know. 40? 58 of them. It could be even more, just think about it. - When will it be clear? - In march. This is my secret hideout. Really? Sometimes I come and spend the night here. Why? To be alone. It is very peaceful. Can't get along with your family? Yes. This is not the problem. I love this place. Alone. Request. Let's sit there. I recommend watching the sea. See you soon? I do not know. - I separated your meal. - Thank you. What's the problem? Is it a girl thing? Where are we going? Now you see. We are about to arrive. Nobody stays at home. Are you okay? You are silent. - Did we go too fast? - No. Yeah, I know it's been fast. I had no other choice. Why? Because my days are numbered. Anise, will you take the bag? What are you doing? Your family has arrived! What are you going to do? Going out the window? I do not know. I guess... it's better if they don't see me. Why? Why? This is the secret between you and me, isn't it? No. Hello. - Let me introduce you to Michelle. - Hello. Hello Michelle. I'm glad to meet you. I'm Agnes. Hello. Jacques I'm glad to meet you. Well. See you again. Bye bye Michelle. - See you. - Ok. All good. Sorry to parents. We are waiting to see you again. Thomas? Yes? I think I'm in love. And I think I'm soaked. It happened in an instant. Remember the kid in that cafe? I showed you his photo. Her name is Michelle. Whenever I think of it... ...with the birds in the forest... ...I want to sing. I want to do everything with him. I think of him every second. I want a future. I've never felt like this. Are you okay? Yes. I am tired. I'll be fine if I go to bed. I followed you. I know you. What are you talking about? I've followed you since the cafe. Simon. Michelle, Thomas. My mind is confused. - I don't understand. - Get back to yourself now! Enough! Mad? Where is Thomas? You should tell ours. No. I can't do this to them. What do you think? Will it be like this for the rest of your life? Will anyone find out about this? I'm not leaving my brother there, Simon. I will call the police. I can go. Too far. You will never see me again. So no one needs to know about it. Shut up! You will go to them immediately and tell the whole truth. Look, I don't want them to suffer. - They don't care about you. You're just afraid they'll hate you, you're a coward! If you don't tell... ...I will definitely find a way for them to learn. I love you. Hello? Sit down. It will not take long. Do you know why you are here? I don't know the details. I only know that Madeleine called. True. Yes. The place where we called and found the boy's bones... ...and she said she knew all about the trail. Our guess is she died 10 years ago. Well, do you recognize this raincoat? I guess yes. We bought it for Simon. What about him? Who else could it be? We don't know that yet. I'm not good. I'm going home. What are you doing? I go outside to get fresh air. So what is this bag for? I'm leaving home for a while. It's like I'm drowning here. Are you leaving without telling us? - Where are you going? - I do not know. What's going on Thomas? Listen, you're just so sad. A lot has happened lately. Let's sit down and have a talk. - Is it about the girl you met? - No, I just want to go. Pay attention to your tone of voice. Now drop your bag and let's talk whatever the problem is. I can't let you go like this, what's going on? Mad! What are you doing? Step aside. Are you both out of your mind? Madeleine, drop that gun now! Madeleine! Tell them who you are. - I don't understand. - Stop it. Come on say it. Mad, put that gun down and tell us what's going on. He's not Thomas. Simon. - What are you talking about? - He's not your son. Come back to yourself. If you don't, I will shoot. - Don't do that, mad. - Get back to reality immediately. Drop it! You'll be fine, honey, just hold on. Back to yourself, Simon. You'll get better, don't talk, help is on the way. Go back to yourself. Do not! Stay with us. - Father! - I'm here, son. - Go back to yourself, what are you waiting for? - Shut up mad, shut up! I am really sad. I love you all. I love you very much. I love you too, son. Mad, what's going on? It's Simon. He fell off a cliff 10 years ago and replaced Thomas. It was Thomas we buried this morning. I am really sad. I'm really sorry. I have to go. You cannot go anywhere. How did you do this? - How did you do this? - I do not know. I knew before. You killed him didn't you? - You pushed him off the cliff. - No. No, it was an accident. I swear, dad. Don't do it, let it go! Don't dad. Jacques! Father! Jacques! Stop! Leave it! Stop! Don't let it get away. Stop! After a month Madeleine, are you coming? Your father is waiting for us at home. I love you. It doesn't matter who you are. Take me with you. Simon! Simon! Madeleine! Madeleine! Madeleine! Help! Madeline! Let's get him to the hospital. Where did you park? Doctor badet? Doctor badet? Ok... now let it go slowly. Wait until I come. Listen, all the exits are closed, no one's out of the hospital yet. That's great, I want your attendant list right away. Names and surnames, even dates of birth. - Visitor and patient list as well. - Okay quickly. Agnes! Jacques? Simon is here. The police are checking everyone's identity one by one. Listen. He helped me bring it. Now let's think about our daughter, okay? This time it's serious. We put him on the emergency list. Is there really no solution, doctor? Would my heart work? We all have the same blood type. Jacques go to him and talk to him. Say everything you have to say. Excuse me, your name and date of birth? Pierre marshal, 20 august 1984.

All exits are closed. We control everyone. We will surely find him. Definitely can't get out of here. Can I talk to him for a minute, please? The second floor is clean.
