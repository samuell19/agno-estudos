In heaven, love comes easy, and never goes. I should know. But on Earth, we all know that learning to love one another is difficult, and much more complicated than it should be. In New York City, under those bright lights, there are eight million people, each with their own love story. So let me take you out to Queens, 'cause this one's personal, and it happens to be my favorite. ♪ She's like the wind ♪ ♪ She'll spin you 'round ♪ ♪ Kicks up the dust, ♪ strolls through town ♪ ♪ I remember these all-time memories ♪ ♪ Summertime in the city ♪ ♪ Said who ♪ ♪ Oh, hey ♪ ♪ That's the way she does it ♪ ♪ You better get out of her way next time ♪ ♪ She's like the race you thought you won ♪ ♪ She's like the cold, she'll keep you numb ♪ ♪ I remember these all-time memories ♪ ♪ Running into the ocean ♪ ♪ I said who ♪ ♪ Oh, hey ♪ ♪ That's the way she does it ♪ ♪ You better get out of her way next time ♪ If you tickle my feet, I'll kill you. You'll kill me? - Yeah, in cold blood. - Oh my God, so violent. - Vinny. - Yeah? - There's a line. - A line? And we don't cross that line. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay, buddy. - Okay, I'll stop. Can I cross this line? - Maybe. - Okay. What about that line? - Another maybe. - Another maybe? Okay. What about this line right here? - Possibly. - Possibly, okay. What about this line? Sure. Shit. - Just leave it. - Vinny, stop. Just leave it. - Vinny, stop. - Just leave it. It's Jenny. - It could be important. - Oh my God. Where are you calling from? Okay, don't hate me, but I got caught up. Gabby, you promised. I know, we can decorate the tree tomorrow. Is he there with you? Hmm? Is he there with you? Listen, Jenny, I just had to study, and Vinny's helping. Vinny doesn't study, he's a high school dropout who can barely read. Is there a point? Yes, I made Christmas cookies and eggnog. I know you'd like that. Listen, I can't always be there. Just let me breathe. Decorate without me. It's not a big deal. You promised me that when my mom died that you'd be there for me, no matter what. You can't always do that. One bad thing goes wrong in your life and your go-to is your mother. You know, I was there, I know. And I'm always there for you. I don't wanna argue with you, not about that stupid tree. It's not stupid! You act like we're dating. And just to make it clear, we're not, so get a life. Don't ever call me again, Gabby, I mean it. Our friendship is over, done. You're dead to me. You good? No! I'm just sick of Jenny treating me like I belong to her. You don't. You're mine. She doesn't get to know you like I do. Let's just do it already. Okay. But be gentle. You can trust me. You're gonna be okay. His heart just stopped. Excuse me. It's a lot different than the world of finance, huh? I'm sorry, I'll get the hang of it. It doesn't get any easier. His owner should've been here to say goodbye. You'd be surprised at how many owners can't handle it. Chance had a life filled with love. Years ago, around Christmas, my father passed away, and I wasn't there for his final moments. My best friend died when I was younger, and I feared she was alone, too. I'm sorry. I loved them so much, and I always wonder if they knew that when they went, and just seeing Chance there. I know. Jennifer, just go home. I think we're done for the day. No, no, no, no, I'm okay. - Go. - I'll get used to it. Get out of here. Are you sure? - Yeah, I got it. - Okay. Thank you. Hey, on my way home. Can we do dinner with your parents another night? I'll have some more martini, darling. Thank you, dear. Okay, you can do this. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Okay, okay. Okay. Your parents are here. So what? - I'm serious, babe. - I love you. I love you, too, babe. After dinner, okay, okay? Let's go. Jennifer, come. - Thank you, dear. - How are you? Mr. Wilks? You're going to die when you see the flower arrangements I've chosen. Okay. We have red roses, amaryllis, tulips, Hypericum berries, and cinnamon sticks as centerpieces. Cinnamon sticks. Jeremy, come, have the decency to wait for everyone else. Now, the good news is, we've got the date. Christmas Eve. And, good news for you, a client of Jeremy's got you an appointment with Vera Wang next Thursday to choose your dress. You knew about this? Listen, honey, you have to trust me on this. A Christmas wedding will be perfect, something no one would expect. This is all very red. I'm spending a lot of time on these details since you can't seem to cope with making decisions, and it's not about a lack of time because you've started a new career. - Mom, leave her career out of this. - What? I'm not questioning why she quit Goldman Sachs to groom animals. I'm just trying to choose flower arrangements here. Alison. Dad, can you pass the broccolini, please. Sure, son. Jennifer, I only want the best for you and David. Maybe it's the whole Christmas wedding thing. It's a lot for me. The thought of it just reminds me I did not get to spend a lot of Christmases with my family, and this is just... I'm sorry. Jennifer, I'm sorry your family's gone, but I'm trying to throw the wedding of the century for you and David, and with only five months. Yeah, well, it just seems to be more about you than us. No, now, see, that's where you're wrong. You only get married once, and it has to be special. Isn't that right, Jeremy? Absolutely. Maybe special can mean something a little bit more intimate. David is the heir to a Fortune 500 company. There is nothing intimate about that. Honey, the broccolini. Now, you were saying? Nothing. Good. Excuse me. Jenn, where are you going? I'm going for a run. I need some fresh air. You can't just leave like that. I can't? Jennifer, come on. Why is it that every time your mother comes around, you just sit and behave like a little boy? She's my mother. Well, it'd be nice if you'd just defend me for once. I do defend you. I'm also not gauging for a fight. I'm not fighting, David. Jennifer, be reasonable. Honestly, David, who has a wedding on Christmas Eve? It is absurd, it is selfish, it's not even us. I know. I would be more than happy to go down to City Hall and have something small on any other date. Yes, but-- Is everything all right? Yes, Mother, - give us a minute. - Jennifer, did I upset you? Mom! A minute. Jennifer, come on. Babe, I love you so much, but this is too much for me. ♪ Slow day ♪ ♪ Slow day ♪ ♪ Slow day ♪ ♪ Slow day ♪ ♪ Slow day ♪ ♪ Slow day ♪ ♪ Slow day ♪ Oh my God! Sir, sir, sir, are you okay? - Yeah. - He came outta nowhere! You saw that, right, he did. Sir, sir, sir, don't move. Let me call 911. No, no, no, no, no, please, don't, I'm fine. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm fine. Yeah, he said he's sure, he's fine, don't call the cops. - What, I'm just saying. - Anyway, let me just help you. - Is this Azrael Gabison? - Are you cool? I'm gonna go. Don't you know not to touch other people's belongings? Sorry, I'm just trying to help. - Sir, can you go get your insurance card? - What for? He just-- - He said he's fine! - Sir, please, just go and get your insurance card! Okay. God, can I help you pick up anything? - No, no, no. - Is this your pen? I'm okay, thank you. Fuck that. - Hey! - Sorry! - Did you get his license plate? - It's a stolen car. That's why he ran. Don't worry about him. What? But we need to call the police! No, we don't, I'm fine. Seriously, what if you have a concussion? I don't have a concussion. Yeah, but that's what everyone says until they realize they had a concussion. God, help me, okay, I gotta go. What, please, please, please, please. Let me just walk with you for a little bit. I just wanna make sure you're okay. Okay, sure, if you must. Does anything hurt? No, I'm fine, thank you. You sure? Yes. You're not even dirty, that's amazing. Yeah, girl, I'm good, I'm gifted. - It's pretty ironic. - What is? They make such a big deal about texting and driving. No one mentions texting and biking. I wasn't texting. All accidents are caused by texting. Girl, accidents can happen for any reason at any time anywhere. To anyone. So it's... kinda late for you to be running around these streets alone. Yeah, I just needed to get some fresh air. What's wrong? My soon-to-be in-laws are in town, and yeah. How soon? Months, maybe Christmas Eve. That's exciting. Everybody loves a Christmas wedding. - Do you wanna talk about it? - Nope. Girl, come on, let it all out. I don't know you, you don't know me. No judgment here. Okay. David, my fiancé, I love him, and I look forward to marrying him. Okay, so what's the issue? A Christmas wedding? Used to be my favorite holiday. Decorating, baking cookies, especially the tree. To make a long story short, my mother passed when I was 15. Then it was just me and my dad. And then me and my best friend got into a horrible fight around Christmas and never spoke again because of me. My dad passed and... I just have a really hard time around Christmas. You know, they never tell you that when your parents die, a part of you dies alongside with them. Hey, you're still living, and when I say living, I mean living living. Look at you, girl, come on. And, I mean, you gotta trust that they're all still here, watching over you, you know? Yeah, but David's mom has made it very clear that, with my dad being gone and their paying, that I have no say. Because they're rich and bossy. See, I knew you'd understand. Can I be honest with you? No. Okay, maybe. You shouldn't underestimate the power of love around Christmas. It's magical. Did you have a love around Christmas? It's complicated. Okay. Look... You need to look around you, really look, and you'll see that life is full of moments of happiness and signs of hope. I mean, your kindness to me proves that. And when you wake up tomorrow-- - Oh, gosh, tomorrow-- - Can I finish, please? Sorry. When you wake up tomorrow, if you look around, you really look, you will see endless possibilities and the answers to your questions, I promise you. Okay. Oh, this is me. Which way are you going? I'll be fine. All right, maybe you don't have a concussion, but I do recommend that you still go see a doctor. And I recommend you get some rest. And I recommend that you stop texting and biking. When you wake up tomorrow, if you look around, you really look, you will see endless possibilities and the answers to your questions. David, please, David, stop! Please, David. You're still in bed? Jenny, come on! Get ready! Smudge needs to go out. It's your turn. There you go, cutie. Mommy's gonna take you out to do your business. Hurry, hurry, we've got a meeting with Father Kelly. Jenny. Gabby? What? No more tequila for you. Come on. Get out, come on! Here. Now, walk the dog. I did it all day yesterday. I still have to do my makeup. Oh, I'm sorry, she doesn't listen, come here! You! You. Do you remember me? Yes. Okay, and what is my name? - Jennifer. - Oh, thank God. Okay, okay, so this is scary. I don't know how I got here. This is my old neighborhood, and I just woke up next to my best friend who I know is dead! I will explain, but, right now, yes, this is your home. No, no, you don't understand. I live in Manhattan. You know that tall, beautiful building that we walked in front of last night? Yes, you got hit by a car! Yeah, I'm sorry, darling, but you don't live there. Okay, I don't know what you're saying, but I am going to scream in a minute, - okay? - Okay, okay. You wanna go back there? I'm warning you, things will be different. Okay, whatever, okay, just get me an Uber, a Lyft. I don't have my wallet. I don't even have my phone, okay, and they-- Okay, girl, you need to chill, all right? Just close your eyes. Excuse me? You wanna get outta here, right? Go ahead, you can trust me. Uh, wait, what? How did you do that? Now, don't be startled by what you see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Honey, didn't I tell you not to open the door to strangers? - Yes, Daddy. - Daddy? Go help your mom with your brother. Sorry about that. Can I help you? Whose child is that? Excuse me? David, what's going on? I don't know how the doorman let you in or what you think you're up to, but I have kids inside, and if you don't leave now, - I'm gonna call the police. - Call the police?! - That's ridiculous. - David, is everything okay? Hi, I'm sorry, do I know you? I... um... Wrong apartment. Wrong apartment. What the fuck was that? I'll explain everything. If that was a dream, I'm ready, wake me up! Okay, close your eyes. Stop telling me what to do! Damn, girl, okay. I said I wanna wake up! Okay, you need to calm down if you want me to explain. I am calm! Okay. My name is Azrael Gabison, and I'm your guardian angel. An angel? Yes, hence the name Azrael. Biblical origin, meaning destruction-- Okay, yeah, so this definitely is a dream. Where are you going? Away from you, this. You said that accident should have killed me, yet I walked away without a scratch. I assure you, this is not a dream. Actually, you, Jennifer Ortiz, are in an alternate world. And here you are happily engaged to be married to-- - I know, David. - No! Your true first love, Gabrielle Vernaci. What? Gabrielle died over 20 years ago, so try again. Well, here in this alternate world, her and others are alive. I don't know what you're talking about it, but fix this. I will, but I can't right now. Look, you went for a run last night to clear your mind, looking for answers to unresolved questions. Yeah, you know what, okay-- And I was thrown, quite literally, into your path to help you find your way. Okay, I was emotional and shared too much with a stranger. My mistake. Jennifer, you've been running away from yourself all these years, and it led you to me. And now I've brought you here to this place to really look around and see what could have been. Been? - How, what, what? - You're telling me this doesn't look familiar to you? Yeah, I grew up here, so? You have 48 hours. Take the time, be present, embrace it all. I get engaged but, like, to Gabrielle? I know. Parts of you know, too, so your heart should always remain open. You have until the end of Christmas. - What? - Good luck. Okay, but you can't just leave me here. But where do I start? Yes, I made Christmas cookies and eggnog. I know you'd like that. Jennifer, Jennifer. Jennifer! Jennifer, ahi estas. Gabriella, te esta llamando. You're late. You're just gonna stand there? Tenemos que irnos, mi hia. Papi? All right, first give your papi un abrazo grande. My papi is alive. Papi, I've missed you so much. I missed you, too, carina. Look how good you look. Y mami? Why would you say that? I love you. I'm just so happy just to-- Okay, okay, vamos. I'll drive you home. Back to Manhattan? You win the Lotto? I don't have my keys. Thank you.

You knew how important that meeting with Father Kelly was. Oh, yeah, what was the meeting about again? Don't do that. Sorry. He said he'd stay and wait for you. Oh, well, yeah, that's good, good. Did you feed Smudge? Who? Oh, the dog, yes, yes, yes, yes, I fed her. Did he go number two? Yes, yes, yes, he did take a shit. Jennifer! Come here. I know you're nervous. You seem distracted. Are you having jitters? I'll meet you at the rectory in ten. We're almost done here. Jennifer. That way. Jennifer. Ah, you remember this picture? My favorite. I was only here for two weeks. You were like a little jumping bean. No one could calm you down, not even Gabby. Such a restless little girl. My favorite. You still seem restless. Ready when you are, Father. Okay, everyone have a seat. Now, what is the big rush? Well, last week your sermon and gospel reading really spoke to us. Good. Not in a good way. Oh. Right, Jenny? Right. You know, the word of God influences people in many different ways, don't you think? I do. Father, as you know, Jenny and I have decided to get married, and, a few months ago, we all spoke about our history here at the church and wanting you to marry us, and I know you said, because of the Church's stance on same sex marriage, that the best you could do is support us. That's correct. But the Supreme Court ruled, Father, and Pope Francis welcomes all, and he expects priests like you to usher parishes into modern times. Yes, but... the author of marriage is God, not society, not government, not man, not your priest. With all due respect, Father, there are other churches in New York City that are officiating same sex marriages. Do you think maybe one of those - would be better suited to you? - No! We were baptized in this church. We had our communions, our confirmations here. I lead your choir. We wanna get married in this church. We have a legacy here. And we feel welcome, but not equal. This is a difficult question for the Catholic Church, and it's been more-- How many years have you been a priest here? - Twenty-three. - I know. Do you remember my senior year of high school? I came to you and confessed about being sexually active, and you said that we're all human and that it'll be okay because, you said, even the best of us have sinned. And yet, months later, I found out I was pregnant. I remember. Good, because you stood by me. I was a scared 18-year-old girl whose old-fashioned Italian parents disowned her, and I came to you, I trusted you. What did you advise me, Father? You know what I advised you. And I still stand by that advice. Like it or not, you are and forever will be a major part of our lives, and that means something to us. And we wanna get married in this church with you officiating. I'm just gonna have to pray on this. Okay. Thank you, Father. Jennifer. Take care. Thank you. Gabby. Do you wanna talk about it? I'm done talking. It's all anyone ever does is talk! How about some action? I'm gonna go grab some things. Is that Jennifer Ortiz? Where you been at? Who's asking? It's Vinny, but you can call me whatever you want to, baby. Excuse me? Where's your better half? I say better 'cause, yeah, that bottom half of hers is hard to forget. Oh, gosh, you're just-- you haven't changed. You look nice. - Excuse me. - I say stand, baby. Gabby, me, you, we can be that unicorn. Why don't you fuck off, Vinny? Can I do that while you watch? - All right. - Seriously? - Jennifer, let's go. - Gabrielle, baby. You always come and go. But when you come... Asshole. And don't you ever disrespect her again. - Whatever. - Go, go, go, go. You two bull daggers deserve each other! Get a life, Vinny! How'd that punch feel in your face, Vinny? You going to your mama's house, Vinny? Asshole! Jerk. Oh my God, that was amazing! Oh God, what a jerk. I can't believe you had sex with him. Oh, I was so young. But Vinny is a disease. Yeah, but I don't wanna live my life dwelling on regrets. That shit will kill you, Jenny. And, besides, after having sex with him, that's how I realized I was gay. The way you put things is so simple. I miss that. Yeah, that day, for me, was when I told my dad how I felt about you. Oh my God, I saw my dad today! It was... You see him every day. Yeah. Yeah, I can't believe you're really here. Oh, Gabby, arroz con leche. I haven't had this in forever! Okay, okay, you tell yourself that for your holiday diet. Okay, I'm just gonna-- Okay, well, don't eat it all, it's for your father. Just a little taste, a little taste. What has gotten into you? Feliz Navidad! Hey, Papi. This guy and me are ready to feast and open all my presents! Yes! Yes! Let's eat, let's eat. Yo te te queiro tambien mi hija. Probably ate it all, though. What, no! It's so good! You still, hands down, make the best coconut rice, 100 %. Thank you, mi hija. Such a good job. - Thank you. - Yeah. Anyway, you know, I went to Father Kelly. She was with me. I told him he'd marry us. Papi, you should have seen how she was standing up for herself. It was so badass. I'm serious. I was standing up for us. Yes. More wine? Papi, no more for you. Your health. He'll have water. I got you. Are you proud of me? How I turned out? Yes. Yeah, but what if I was to marry a man, say, a rich man from a rich family? Todos quieren ser ricos. Sure, I'm happy if you marry a rich, good man. But Gabrielle, she's strong, she'd take good care of you. You two always laughing. Mi hija you are lucky. This is honest. Oh, no! Yeah, now I know why Jenny can't handle hers. Bullshit, I'll take his, thank you very much. Thank you. Well, I wanna make a toast. - Oh. - Okay. You two are my family. You, Papi, you have been more of a dad to me than my own. Thank you for raising us both. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no. Christmas is my favorite time of year. Love, family, and good spirits! No mas para ti tompcoc. I can't wait to marry you. I love you so much, Jenny. - Salu. - Salu! Reported comments by the Pope could signal a major shift for the Catholic Church and its views on homosexuality. A survivor of clerical sexual abuse, Juan Carlos Cruz, says that when he told the Pope he was gay, the Pope responded, and I'm quoting now, "God made you like this, God loves you like this." For more, I'm joined by CNN's Vatican correspondent Delia Gallagher. Way too much. I'm busting my pants. They're busting open. Gabby, I'm sorry I wasn't there for you. I should've never stopped talking to you. Whatever. That's old, we're past it. It's not whatever, can I finish? Go ahead. You know that day that we fought? Ooh, we fought many days. Be more specific. You know, that day in December when I wrote that letter. Oh, that letter where you told me never to talk to you again. You were so stubborn about it. Yeah, I was upset. That day was gonna be the day when I told you how I felt, and you just dismissed me. I didn't dismiss you. Yes, you did. You are who I heard in all the love songs and who I got cute for, like, dressed up for at school. I mean, you knew how important you were to me. I'm not important to you anymore? Of course, you are. It's just that that day, the fight, and you moved, and, yeah, I've just waited so long just to be true to you. You have to be true to yourself. That's always been your problem. Yeah, well, I was trying to, but it was really hard. Okay, you wanna go back? The only thing I do remember you telling me was to drop dead. You have no idea. Okay, I was crushed. I was hurt, too. You know, I hate that my family didn't want me, and then I come to you, and you don't want me, either. That was hard for me. I moved west, by myself. I couldn't even come say goodbye to you. How do you think that made me feel? The only person I've ever loved pretending I didn't exist. You turned your back on me. Yeah, but you still left. And I came back! I came back. No one's perfect, Jenny. And, deep down, you know what you want, but you're shit scared to say it, and after all these years, it's still the same thing with you. You hated me, great. I said I hated you, too. We moved on. Yeah, but why him? Jennifer, if you don't stop, we can't have our own life if you keep mentioning Vinny as if he matters. It's late. It's time for you girls to go home. Thanks for dinner. Come here. Thanks for dinner, Dad. I don't wanna leave you. I'm okay. You go to talk to her. Stay there. Read it. Out loud. "December 5th, 1999. Dear Gabby, I don't want you to..." Go on. "I don't want you to write back, call me, or keep in touch. You hurt me so much. I don't want to feel this way again about anyone, even you. When you see me, don't talk to me. You're dead to me. Jennifer." Yeah. I shouldn't have written that. But you wrote it, and you were honest. Yeah, it was a mistake. Hey, I'm not upset, I'm past it. And I respected your decision until I couldn't anymore because I love you too much. Do you understand that? Yes. Good. And that's why we're perfect, because we know the worst about each other. True. Still okay. Yeah. Come on. It's Christmas, let's go to bed. Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

Merry Christmas. Father Kelly called, had to leave early for church. Do not be late, and do not wear my leather pants. Don't be late. Mwah! Today from the Old Testament, according to First Corinthians, Chapter six, verse nine, "Or do you not know that wrong-doers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Fornicators, adulterers, male prostitutes, sodomites, thieves, drunkards, revilers, and robbers, none of these will inherit the kingdom of God. And this is what some of you used to be, but you were washed, you were sanctified, and you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." The word of the Lord, please be seated. Well, this is... This is one of the most damning, hurtful, and misused Christian passages in the Bible. This passage has a direct correlation to the rise of gay Catholic suicides. People are dying from this. This travesty needs to stop. We can't change yesterday, but today matters, so it's going to be my decision that we embrace equality here at Our Lady of Hope, and I must beg of you, for the future of our world and with the Christmas spirit in mind, to embrace love as love. Love as love. Surely that's what Jesus meant when he said love your brother... ...as thyself. Love is love. Is there any doubt in your mind? So now when I call your name, I want you to join me at the altar. Jennifer Ortiz. Go ahead, mi hija. Felicia Shonday. Beatrice Alverado. Henry Janks. Nina Silva. William Catrell. Gerald Solowski. And Gabrielle Vernaci. The word... "homosexuality" did not appear in the English translation of the Bible until 1946, with a decree that barred same sex relationships from marriage and from holy communion, saying they were a broken people. I've counseled every single person on this altar, and I can tell you they are not broken, but the system is broken. Now, please, take your partner, and prepare for the body of Christ. Body of Christ. The body of Christ. In case you're wondering what just happened, this is the first communion offering for same sex couples at Our Lady of Hope. Congratulations. Now, it is an exciting day and a special day for two of God's children, Gabrielle Vernaci and Jennifer Ortiz. All right, let's begin this. Gabrielle, please take Jennifer's hand. What? My hand for what? Do you trust me? Yeah, always. Gabrielle... do you take Jennifer to be your lawfully wedded partner, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, til death do you part? I do. Jennifer, do you take Gabrielle as your lawfully wedded partner, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and health, to love and to cherish, til death do you part? Jennifer? I do. Oh, she scared us. Okay, now. Exchange rings. Now repeat after me. Take this ring. Take this ring. As a sign of my love and faithfulness. As a sign of my love and faithfulness. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, amen. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And now, with the power vested in me, I pronounce you wife and wife. You may kiss the bride. Yeah! And now our choir will sing Hymn number 143, Ding Dong, Merrily On High. ♪ Ding dong, merrily on high ♪ ♪ In heaven the bells are ringing ♪ ♪ Ding dong, verily the sky ♪ ♪ Is riven with angels singing ♪ ♪ Gloria ♪ ♪ Hosannah in excelsis ♪ ♪ Gloria ♪ You look so beautiful! Oh my gosh, let me help you. First off, this is cute. Okay, who planned this? Papi handled the reception. He got a heads-up from Father Kelly, and then they sprung the idea of a surprise wedding on me, and I just loved it. Seriously? Mm hmm. Man. Yeah. I didn't get to wear a dress.

See? A Christmas wedding's kind of nice. I know why you're here, but, no, I am not leaving. Shall I remind you that this is an alternate world? In your real world, you're soon to be married to David, and you have an intended life to live. I know that, but I can't just leave. I'll decide that. It's not real. It is real. My father's real here, Gabby's real here. It is real to me. Your life has, at times, been difficult, and I understand because I have always been there, watching over you. Jennifer, you should know that I'm the deceased child of Gabriel and Vincent. What? I don't understand. Azrael Gabison. Azrael... Gabby's son. Well, if you're Gabby's son then she needs to meet you. No, that's not how this works. This experience was for you, and only for you, to live your truth. My truth? That I buried in 1999? You have until the end of the night to make peace and say goodbye. And congratulations. Azrael. Jennifer, come. Jennifer. Jennifer, what are you doing? Guests are waiting. Um... Who were you talking to? Jennifer, why are you crying? Gabby, I want you to know that I will never forget this as long as I live. I can't lose you again. I'm not going anywhere. It's our wedding day. Let's go in. Okay, just give me a minute. Okay. Azrael. Azrael! Where are you? You look so good in that dress. Gosh, who'd have thought it, a Christmas wedding? Yeah, and you're my favorite present. No, no, no, no, no, you can't sleep. - I can. - No. - Yeah. - I don't want this... night to end. It won't. We'll always have tomorrow. Tomorrow becomes yesterday. Smudge. What's a smudge? How long have I been out? You mean when you ran out of here after dinner and snuck back inside? That was last night? Jen. Where's your parents? Back at the hotel. Anyway, look... I'm sorry I didn't stand up for you last night. I need to be more supportive, I realize that. My mother has her issues, but that's her, not us. You and I are starting a life together, and we, together, will plan our marriage, not her. And I'm all for getting married however and wherever you may see fit. Really? - Do you mean that? - Of course. Okay, good, then get dressed and take a ride with me. Where to? This is where I grew up, my life before you. Queens, it's like a different world out here. Only 30 minutes from Midtown. Who would've thought? What? That might be one of the meanest things you ever said to me. "A different world?" Not in a bad way, it's just... we should come out here more often. It seems so close. It's silly, all the things that keep us busy. Yeah, well, we're here now. I just need to know. Need to know what? Pull over. - Why, hello. - Hi. Um... I'm looking for Father Kelly. Father Kelly isn't here anymore. Right. Well, I would like some information on a past parishioner. Oh, uh, what is their name? It's Gabby, I mean, Gabrielle Vernaci. It's V-E-R-N-A-C-I. Gabrielle and I were married, we were baptized and confirmed here. Wow, I can't-- This is, um... That's me and that's Gabby. I can't believe that photo that Father Kelly had is still here. I remember Gabby. I didn't really ever know her full name. It was very sad, her story. Yeah, well, her family never told me exactly what happened, which is why we are here. I'm sorry, this is my fiancé David. Oh, hello, David. Hello. I'm not sure, but I think Gabby was pregnant, and I don't know the full story. All I know is that for 20 years, no one has told me what actually happened. Well, Father Kelly counseled her for weeks to keep her child. In fact, he even arranged for Gabby to go to a home for single mothers out west to have her baby. You see, her family had disowned her, so she came to the church for help. Well, unfortunately, her baby didn't have much of a chance. She gave birth to a stillborn at 29 weeks. Azrael Gabison. Azrael. Gabby's son. And then she walked through a crosswalk and was hit by a car. Witnesses said she absentmindedly had stepped right out into traffic. I need to find Father Kelly. Sadly, no one's heard from Father Kelly since he was removed from the ministry for officiating many private same sex marriages. He was a romantic. He even married my wife Alice and I. Thank you very much. You're welcome. I'm so sorry. God bless both of you. Young love is so beautiful. I hope you both have a blessed life. Hey, should I be worried? David, I love you. It's just that Gabby was my first love. I wish you would have met her. I wish I could've met her, too. David, I just need a minute. Sure. - I'll be right there. - Yeah. I didn't think I'd get to see you again. I need your guidance. Jennifer, are you happy? Are you happy? It's hard to be right now, but I can be. Okay. I'm gonna give you the power to make one final choice. How do you mean? I can take you back in time, if that's what you truly want. I am your guardian angel. However, depending on how far back, I will never be able to visit you again, and I will cease to exist, and I'm okay with that. Would you like to start over? Well, what about David? You saw for yourself, he'll be okay. How do I know that for sure? This isn't about him. It's about you, your eternal happiness. Only you have the power to decide your fate. Trust your heart, and it'll lead the way. I wanna go back. Do you know exactly when and where? Yeah. All right, give me your hands. Love deeply, trust your heart, and be brave. Say that back to me. Come on, Jennifer, you gotta say it. Love deeply. Love deeply. Trust your heart. Trust your heart. And be brave. And be brave. Now close your eyes. Go ahead. By the power vested in me. ♪ This is the calm before the storm ♪ Where are you calling from? Okay, don't hate me, but I got caught up. Gabby, you promised. I know. We can decorate the tree tomorrow.
