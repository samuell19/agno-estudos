Take the grey one to the mayor, Valentin. Yes sir. I'll go and check on Mrs Labbé. Careful with your hands on the hats! Amazing! I'll go and check on Mrs Labbé. The door! Make sure you switch off the gas. Alice. Get Patrick out of my way. I won't be late home. Get some rest. Lock up after me, Valentin. Yes sir. I won't be late home, Louise. - Valentin will close the shop. - Yes sir. Alice! I'm going for a walk. Don't come back late. - Can we come too? - No you can't. You stay and help your mother. Come on, we'll bake a pie. Good evening, Mr Kachoudas. Good evening, Mr Labbé. A new letter from the strangler! Read the Atlantic Echo! A new letter from the strangler... Thank you. Read the Atlantic Echo! A new letter from the strangler! Read the Atlantic Echo! Atlantic Echo? - Evening Léon, how are you? - Evening Gabriel. Same old, same old. 5 clubs. - Evening Léon. - Good evening. I'll pass. Evening Léon. Pass. Léon, will you replace me after this game? No, not tonight, no. How's your wife? Oh, same as always. - The usual? - Yes. A glass of white wine and a grenadine for Mr Labbé. - Evening Jeantet. - Evening Mr Labbé. Excuse me, I have to finish my article for tomorrow morning. He promised to hand it to me before 8 o'clock. I'm almost done. The strangler sent us another letter yesterday. You've read the Echo? Letters cut out from a newspaper again. Talking directly to me, because of my last article. You are mistaken young man. It is not out of cowardice that I am after old ladies but out of necessity. If the necessity required me to attack a man, however big and strong, I'd still do it. Sorry Jeantet, but I can't hear myself think. Sorry. This maniac's feats are not that interesting after all. Still, the police have no leads and the women are scared. He's clever. Thanks, Gabriel. Well done Doctor. - Why did you double? - I had 2 aces! But I ruffed hearts... May I? Thank you, Kachoudas. 1 club. - Pass. - 1 diamond. 1 heart. - 1 no trumps. - Pass. I've finished. 2 no trumps. - 3! - 2 or 3? - 3 no trumps. Why did you pass? The senator obviously had the lady. How was I to know? The senator is never short of ladies! Always joking... - You're leaving, Léon? - I promised Mathilde. Goodbye Léon. How much do I owe? 2 Francs! Next time, try to play the first 2 movements... Miss Millard, you should wait a while... My husband will be here soon. He'll walk you home... It's only a few yards away. I'll leave the door open until you're home. No, it's too cold! Get inside and close the door. See you next Friday. I wouldn't do that, Kachoudas. - You're late, Kachoudas! - I was at the café. Esther, go get a towel for your father. Hurry up, Esther. It's only me. It's me, Louise. Did madam ask for anything? Don't bother. Don't bother. Don't bother, it's only me. - It's me. Has madam called? - No sir. You eat your soup. Hand me your plate. Just a little. Eat. Not so much. How was the café? Same as usual. Always the same. There you go sneezing in the soup. You want a piece of fruit? An apple for Mrs Labbé. - Is the tray ready? - Yes. Go and get it then. And then go to bed. Good night, Louise. Good night, sir. Here's your dinner, my sweet. Mutton chops. And some mashed potatoes. Move over. Move over, damn you! I wouldn't do that, Kachoudas. The sixth one is dead, young man, and the whole town is going to mourn her. She was alone and poor, but that's not the reason I killed her. I killed her like the others because I needed to. I do what I must and that's it. Unless someone is careless, there's only one more to go. That'll be 7 in total. All the investigations in the world won't change that. As proof, I can tell you the next killing will occur on Monday. You hear that Kachoudas? You're losing your head! Good morning, Kachoudas. Good morning, Mr Labbé. I caught a cold. I'm going for a walk. Back in 15 minutes. Get my hat and coat. Don't sniff like that. - Well! - So, Berthe... You're at the market very early. After ten, there's nothing left. What did you buy? Some langoustines. They're lovely. Are you going to eat all that? I have someone coming over for lunch. We haven't seen each other in a while. Léon, stop by sometime. Put aside a pound of langoustines for me. I'll send someone to get them. Good morning madam. - Good morning madam. - Good morning sir. I don't care much for this one. Excuse me. We'll find you another one. Louise! Yes sir? I had some langoustines put aside for me at the market. - Go and fetch them. - Yes sir. I'll show you a more suitable model. Sir, madam is calling. I'm on my way. - I like this one! - Oh no! Valentin, the caps. If you'll excuse me? Read the Atlantic Echo! The strangler's new victim. A reward of 2 million to whoever helps catch the murderer. What's the matter? You've knocked over your glass? Awful, this strangler! I wouldn't dare go out if I lived in town. I like this one, but it's a little tight. Do you have a larger size? I'm not sure, I'll check. Sir, we have a 55 and we'd need a 57... I'll go and see. - You'll close the shop, Valentin. - Yes sir. See you on Monday, have a nice Sunday. - 17. - 13. - No, 17! 18. - The usual Léon? - Yes! - Evening, Superintendent. - Evening, Labbé. You had it coming. Nice break all the same. Yes, thank you. Something wrong? Indigestion... A white wine. - For me too, Gabriel. - 2 white wines. You drink too much. I know. - Why? - Do you want to know? I'm a loser. Fool. I should know. Léon, take over. I have to talk to my voters. It's a lucky seat. Watch out. We received a new letter. He's announced a new murder on Monday. Have a look. Show it to the Superintendent at the pool table. Wise guy! They'll catch him sooner or later. What then? He'll be sent to an institution. We'll have to pay for it until his death. If I find him first, let me tell you... We won't pay much. Easy for you to say... Gentlemen, this time he's gone too far. We have him now. Did you hear that idiot? He really goes too far. 2 clubs. Do you think he's a madman? He must be. He'll only stop when he's caught. No-one caught Jack the Ripper, and yet he stopped killing. Jack the Ripper. How many did he kill? 3 diamonds. - Pass. - 3 spades. Pass. I don't know but he terrorised London for months. The army intervened, and some factories had to shut down because the female workers were scared to go out. 4 hearts. I'd like to know how many women there are in the streets right now. Are you passing? Pass. 4 no trumps. Fine. 5 diamonds. Pass. 6 diamonds. Double. Redouble! Pass. It worked. Good. So, guys... Cards on the table. I take that. That makes 3 trumps. I leave you the king of spades and I clean up the rest. Agreed? Agreed. I had nothing. Easy come, easy go. - Gabriel, my grenadine? - It's coming. Now they have a weak spot. The Superintendent is on the phone. They're setting up a mousetrap for Monday. He says he's mad but I'm not convinced. If there's a crime today or tomorrow, then we'll know it's all nonsense. I don't think his letters are nonsense. Of course! Why did he go after my sister? She never harmed anyone. Maybe he doesn't like old ladies. Léon... Léon... Léon... If I die, swear you won't remarry. Swear it. Your turn Léon. One diamond. Your turn. Sorry, I was miles away... I was thinking of... can't remember what. You say... diamonds? One heart. When I go, don't stay single. You'll find a nice girl to marry. Maybe she'll give you some children. You can give her my jewellery. Promise me Léon. Answer me... Promise? 3 clubs. Pass. 3 no trumps. Pass. Have you noticed? They're all more or less our age. Who? The victims... I slept with two of them, and almost married one. My sister? No, not your sister. - A brandy please. - One brandy. For once I'm the dummy. - It's gonna be tough. - I'm counting on you. - Gabriel? - The usual? No! Brandy and water. Excuse me a minute. Easy, Kachoudas. I came to this town 8 years ago. With my family. It's nice here. We mind our own business. And... As for the money... we don't care. Good. So, your strangler...? He's bluffing. But, we'll get him. Jeantet doesn't think he's bluffing. Oh well, if Jeantet doesn't think so... it changes everything. Good night gents. What an idiot. Low score. We'll make it up. If anyone can uncover the strangler's identity, it's Jeantet. I'm not so sure... Can we please change the topic? I thought you were on the outs with your sister? You seem fascinated by this strangler... And you aren't? No... 1 spade. If you don't mind, I'll leave my place to someone else. Take my seat, Jeantet. It's a loss for them. Say hello to Mathilde. Yes. Good night. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow's Sunday. 'Til Monday then. Monday... The bill please. Good night and thank you, sir. Good night gentlemen. 'Night. Here, chicky chicky... Good night, Mr Kachoudas. Good night, Mr Labbé. What's wrong? You sound strange... No. My voice is fine. You reek of alcohol. What are you saying? What will the children think? So... did you sleep well? Want me to put you in your chair? I'll take care of you. I'll make two trips... Enough with that nonsense. Come here my beauty. Would you like a lie in? Lazy bitch. There you go. Léon, do I smell funny? No, you don't smell funny. There, make yourself at ease. See how pretty you are? Want to have a peek outside? Do you want to know? Good morning, Louise. Morning sir. The coffee is still hot. Everything you need is in the pantry. Is madam alright? As usual. Thank you Louise. I'll leave now, I don't want to miss the bus. Say hello to your parents for me. I'll close the door. Goodbye, sir. Fat cow. Fat cow! Dirty tramp! That's enough now. You'll get a cramp. The dear Mrs Kachoudas. That fat Louise. Disgusting. You can imagine the underwear marks on her flabby flesh. She's like cattle. Am I right Mathilde? How about some breakfast? Not hungry? Let me tell you about my progress. It might interest you. Look. That's you. You weren't the prettiest... but you looked the most gentle and obedient. Look how you squint as you smile. And on your right, it's Jacqueline Delaubelle, the first one. It was easy. A frail widow. I killed her by the canal. I'll show you. It's in the paper. And there, right above is Rosalie Cujas the bookseller with her good-for-nothing husband. Ten years ago, you told her at one of your parties "life isn't fun". She answered "why should it be?". I killed her in the back of her shop. Where she hid her naughty magazines. Anne-Marie Lange, the seamstress. She never got married, she was too plain. At the autopsy, they discovered she had a tumour, which was turning into a cancer. I'll prepare lunch. I hope you don't mind. I won't be long. Eat. Eat something. Some meat. Eat. Some potatoes. Eat your meat. Don't like it? Not even a taste? Not curious? Eat! I'm back. A fine stew. You should have had some. Oh well! At least the fat cow can cook. Our friend the tailor is finishing lunch as well. Put some sugar on for your brother. Why did I bother, Kachoudas? - You hardly ate a thing. - I wasn't hungry. I'll make up for it next time. He has a hangover. Poor old Kachoudas. Here on this photo, that Geoffroy-Lambert. Your friends' faces, unbelievable. She was the tallest one, the handsomest one. She gave me quite a hard time. She had an umbrella! Almost poked my eye out. I had to attend her funeral. I owed it to her brother. He wasn't so sad. It seemed that nobody cared about her. And that her death only mattered to me. Then I killed the midwife. It was so easy, I can't remember it. But Kachoudas saw me come in. He looked surprised to see me come home so late. He began to keep watch, and when I killed Irene, he was in the middle of the street, terrified. Poor Kachoudas. He waited so long to find some peace, he went across so many countries, so many cities... Brave Kachoudas. Don't worry, don't be afraid. I won't say a thing. Mummy made you some tea. Shall I switch on the light? Only one more to go, Mathilde. Her, Amandine, your best friend. Mother Saint Ursule! Is that it? Amazing how you can see in this photo how different she looks from the others, like God had already chosen her. I'll kill her tomorrow. You said that each Monday she goes to visit the poor? At 5pm? First she goes to church, then at 5 she goes to see the poor. I'll stalk her, and come 6 it will be all over. Over. Mathilde. And life can follow its normal course again. The mayor, Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour warns the population to be more careful than ever on Monday, December 20th. The criminal who has been terrorising the town for over a month and who has already murdered six women has announced that he will kill again today. Every measure has been taken to prevent this crime from happening... Valentin is late... Valentin is late! Why is she sulking? The patrols will be more frequent. The mayor, Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour warns the population to be more careful than ever on Monday, December 20th. Sorry? I'm late. Half an hour. You don't look well... I have a fever, it must be the flu. Have you taken any aspirin? Let me see. Do you have white spots in your throat? My mother checked this morning, it's very red but no white spots. It's annoying. I would have let you off, but I have to go out this afternoon... Will you be alright? Yes sir, I'll try. Good boy! It's usually quiet on Mondays. Already here? Just in time. I'm just dropping by to say I won't be playing today. Just one game? No, Mathilde caught a cold. I promised her to... go home straight away. Hello gents. You're saved. - The usual? - No, no time. - Léon? - Yes? You really can't make it by 6 o'clock? I'm supposed to be getting off with Berthe. I can't promise you anything. Try to understand... Yes I do but... try anyway. Let's play cards. - Hello Léon. - Hello Berthe. Kachoudas. Come my child... My child. Be reasonable... You've run and sweated, and now you're cold. You'll catch your death. Come on. My little Kachoudas. What an adventure! Where do you come from? Where were you born? Pretty far away. Very far away. I was born in Yerevan, in Armenia. My father was a tailor too. I was the youngest of five children. My three elder brothers died, nobody knew what happened. So the rest of us left for Turkey. We were very poor. And my sister disappeared. Without a trace. My mother died from sadness. I stayed two more years in Ankara with my father, where he taught me the trade. And then we took a boat for Cyprus. And my father died there, I was 17. I had to make a living, but as a tailor it wasn't possible. Fortunately I found a job on a boat to Marseille. Oh, not right away. It took about 3 years. I don't know how I managed to survive. I'm boring you... Not at all, but I'm expected at the church... Wait for me here, I won't be long. I like it here, you know... All I want is a quiet life here with my family. But of course I understand. Wait for me. Come in, my son. I'm sorry Léon, I didn't recognise you. - You know me? - Yes, Léon Labbé! From the hat shop. I'm Marcel Migout, the bartender's son. Migout! But of course. We sat next to each other in class one year. In 8th grade. You were better at Latin than me. But you did let me cheat. I need to see Mother Marie-Ursule. Mother Marie-Ursule? But... My wife told me she came here every Monday. Yes, listen... Excuse me a minute. This way, sir. Mother Marie-Ursule? I am Mother Jeanne of the Annunciation. Mother Marie-Ursule left us two weeks ago, my son. Left you? She went somewhere else? In all His goodness, God took her to spare her the pain. She died... Mother Marie-Ursule had an incurable disease. Did you know her? She was a friend of my wife. She was to visit her on her birthday. They were schoolmates. Like us. But women are more faithful to childhood friendships. It's all over now. What's wrong? You look pale... Would you like a cup of tea? No, I have to go. I must get back. Kachoudas. Didn't you wait for me? Go home my boy, I'll close the shop. Take my umbrella. There! Did madam call? No, sir. If you're not feeling well, stay home tomorrow. Thank you sir, good night. Do you want me to close the shutters? Go, I'll close them. To be alone. - Good evening, Louise. - Good evening, sir. You're all wet! You thought I was asleep. How can I sleep with the light on. What are you reading? What on earth are you reading again? I can't sleep with the light on, turn it off or talk to me! Read me something. Why don't you answer me? Why don't you read something out loud? It's a dirty book, isn't it? Filth! I'm sure you're a pervert! I know you're up to obscenities when you go out and leave me alone. With Berthe Lachaume! When I could walk I saw her, that bitch in her purple dresses. She slept with all of you! You can't do this to me. Why won't you see anyone? I don't want to. Nobody. Nobody! You said that already. Your heart is as dry as a stone. I'm 56, I'm not old! Tell me I'm not old. Go on, tell me, "you're not old". NO, YOU'RE NOT OLD!! Liar, liar!! Talking rubbish as usual! You are so mean. Do who know who wrote that letter to me this morning? Rosalie Cujas. She saw you. You bought her a book about the Lafarge case. You see, nothing gets past me. She also told me she'll come and visit me. On my birthday. You imprison me, but I've still got my friends. They'll be there all seven of them for my birthday. Whether you like it or not. You know I'm happy for you. Shut up. You're a monster. Where's the maid? Gone already, to visit her parents, like every Sunday. Liar, I know you're sleeping with her. If you saw her... She's fat and filthy. Liar, you've slept with her. You were always keen on whores. Berthe Lachaume, the maid! Calm down. No, you're a pervert! You take advantage of my paralysis to do your dirty business. You sequester me so you can go out womanising. It's you who won't see anybody. Stop it. You hurt me so! Stop it, stop it. I'm in pain. Stop crying, I'm tired too. Stop it. Shall I serve you your dinner and prepare the tray after? Yes, after. - I made roast veal with sorrel. - Very well. While you eat, I'll go and close the shutters. I noticed they were left open. Some bread! No, no, not Louise! Certainly not Louise! It's all over now. Morning sir. I'm alright, my nose stopped running. Fine. Are you alright? Why do you ask? You don't look well. I had a bad night. - Because of Mrs Labbé? - Drop it. Get your overall. - Sir? - Yes, morning miss. My mother wants to know if you have a doctor's address. For my father. - Is your father ill? - He has a high fever. He coughs and says it hurts when he breathes. Since when? Last night, he went out in the rain. Why did he do that? Typical of my father. I have a friend, nearby... Doctor Chandrot. - Chandron? - Chandrot! - 17 Echelles street. - Thank you, sir. - I'll brush the caps. - What? I'll go and brush the caps. I'll go buy the newspaper. Is the tailor ill? The tailor... my hat! Thank you. Good morning, Mr Labbé. Stupid fools. I have some errands to run. I won't be back before 6. You close the shop, Valentin. Berthe. Berthe! I bet she's with someone. It must be Chandrot. If it's a madman you can't understand him. Unless you're mad yourself. Hello Léon. He was afraid to be caught. The usual? Maybe he doesn't like rain. It rained cats and dogs yesterday. Already here, Léon? I'm not blaming you, mind you. I don't think that. That the rained stopped him. It's too easy. Are you playing, Léon? You look pale. Didn't sleep well. Gabriel, the cards. Say, Léon... what do you think? Of that unstrangling strangler? I don't know. Maybe he's finished. It can't be, Mr Labbé, for two reasons: First, he announced a murder last night so that's at least one murder left. Anyway a man like that only stops when he's caught. Then maybe his victim stayed home. One club. That would mean he doesn't kill for pleasure. Pass. One spade. That's what he says in his letters. 2 diamonds. What he writes isn't necessarily true. The proof is that he didn't kill again last night. Do I detect a touch of sorrow in that remark? Gabriel, give me a... I'm finishing my article, I have a few theories. The hell with it, 4 spades. Here are my 4 spades. Lost your dog, Léon? I never had a dog. I mean your tailor, Kachoudas. He follows you everywhere. The dog is dogsick. - By the way... - Yes, thank you... Your neighbour isn't well. He caught the flu, the fool. Is he very ill? In my opinion, he's going to die. His lungs were a mess already, and after last night... You've got no trumps? I was elsewhere. You're not so well yourself. I told you I'm a bit tired! At least your lungs are ok. Luckily for you. Gabriel, get me a brandy. One brandy! It's a medicine after all. It's a treacherous month. Here. 2 trumps, the king to you... and the rest are mine. Well played Doctor. We need to wake up. Stupid fools. The shop is closed. Daddy's ill. I know, I came to see him. The man from across the street wants to see daddy. Mr Labbé. Mr Labbé, poor Kachoudas is very ill. Doctor Chandrot told me. May I see you husband? Of course, he will be pleased. Follow me. I'm afraid he'll die. Could die. Mr Labbé is here to pay you a visit. Evening Kachoudas. Evening, Mr Labbé. You left last night. Yes. You know, Kachoudas. Yes. You know why? I killed my wife two months ago. But I see her by her window every day... No, I killed her two months ago. And her birthday is in three days. And on that day her friends always visit. Every year for ten years, they come round on her birthday. That's why I had to kill them. You understand? So that nobody suspects that my wife is dead. Do you want to know something? I'm finished. I won't kill again. No more reason to. Do you understand what I said? - Yes. - It's over. You believe me? May I have a glass of water? Where can I find some water? In the kitchen. He wants some water. It's the fever. He's very ill. He has trouble breathing. Let me, I'll bring it to him. You have your own troubles. Your poor wife who can't walk. Tell me, Kachoudas do you believe me? Yes. Who's there? Is it you sir? Oh it's you, sir. Madam didn't call? She never does when you're away. I'm not hungry tonight, just prepare the food tray for madam. Very well sir. Kachoudas... Quick, Esther! Get up! You father isn't breathing... Young man, regardless of what people will say or think, I always accepted, and will continue to accept all... my... responsibilities. I always chose freely I go on and shall go on choosing. Some will argue that I wanted to free myself. Damn you! That's nonsense. I swear I swear I never took any perverted pleasure. Why are you roaming around all night long like a wild beast? Don't do it. It's the last thing I should do. She didn't say where she went? She just asked my permission to go out. So how is he? It's over. Dead? He had an awful night and he's been in a coma for 4 hours. Shouldn't he be in a hospital...? Isn't it better to die in your own bed? Poor fellow. Why "poor fellow"? We all are, old chap. Let me walk with you... Something has come up, my maid has disappeared. What do you mean? Well... She left last night and hasn't returned today. You must tell Pigeac. Isn't it a bit early? Not with this strangler on the loose. I'm going to see his wife, she had an asthma attack. I'll tell him to stop by your shop later on. You're a friend. Are you playing this afternoon? I think so. Go on! Good day, sir. Good day, sir. Mr Labbé! It's Superintendent Pigeac. Hello Superinterdent. I was in the kitchen, trying to figure this out. Hello Labbé. Doctor Chandrot told me about it vaguely. Your maid has vanished? Yes. She left last night and didn't return. I went to her room, she was gone. She didn't say anything? Not a word. She only asked my permission to leave... Has it happened before? No, no. She's been here for 6 months, and only went out 3 or 4 times. On Sundays, she went to Charron to see her parents. What is it? I see... Do you want to see her room? Yes! Please. Follow me. This is our bedroom. My wife hasn't left it for 15 years. - Yes, I know. - Pardon? I know. It's part of the attic we converted. She wasn't allowed to use this wardrobe. Ah... She didn't take her things. Her coat is here. Odd. She also had a raincoat, she must have taken it. I'm worried about this strangler. I understand. Tell me, have you seen this young man? Sorry? Around here? Not that I remember... You didn't know she had a boyfriend? I didn't pay attention to her none of my business. She is the sulky type, rather grumpy. I'll keep this picture. I'll hand it over to the department. Do as you please, if you think it's necessary. Mr Kachoudas isn't any better. What's that? The tailor from across the street, he's very ill. Well... We'll take care of your business right away. Goodbye my dear Labbé. Ah, what's her name? Goodbye. Chapu. Louise Chapu. Thank you. Does he think she's been strangled? Like us, he doesn't know. How did you find out about Kachoudas? The girl came out crying. She came to tell you they called for a priest. It's an odd day. An odd day. Has my wife called? No sir. How will you manage for lunch? Ah yes. I'll go to a restaurant. And for your wife? I'll ask them for a takeaway. Will you eat with me? Oh no. My mother gave me some food. And someone should stay here for Mrs Labbé. Yes, you're right. Hurry up. It's a surprise to see you here, Mr Hatter. Yes. It's been almost 15 years... since I've been to a restaurant. I beg your pardon. Good day. You'll be comfortable there. - Here? - I'd rather... As you wish. We have some veal chops with sorrel, and some very fine snails. I'll have the snails. - A pitcher of Beaujolais? - Yes please. A pitcher of Beaujolais. Enjoy. Thank you. Excuse me, miss. - How was everything? - Very nice! The veal chop, the snails... Perfect. Say, Henriette, I'd like to take something away for my wife. Do you have some kind of container? I'll check. Will this do? Yes, it's fine. Shall I give her some snails too? Yes, some snails. - Has madam called? - No sir. I'll take her lunch up. Redouble! They're delicious. You should try some. Don't you want the chop either? I'll throw it away. Not hungry any more. What is it, Valentin? I'm Louise's father. Yes, hello sir. So she left? - The police told you? - Yes. Did you keep her things? Of course, everything is in her room. - I'll go and get them. - Be my guest. Follow me. So this is where she spent her week? So she left all of a sudden? Without a word? Without a word. Is it true she had a boyfriend? She never mentioned him, I never saw him. Your wife's a cripple, right? Yes, she is. Please lower your voice. She's behind that door. Do you think the strangler got her? I don't know. I haven't heard anything about it. If we find her, don't count on her coming back. It's the last time I send one of my daughters to town. 11. Any news? Nothing yet. It's normal. 12. Do you want to take my place? I'm tired, I'll watch you play. Your maid's gone? I haven't seen her since last night. He must've dumped her in the canal. Impossible, these stranglers never change their methods. Or it's a new series, a different meaning... What meaning? It's hard to explain, and I'm in the way of your game. I agree on the last part. Hello. Hello gentlemen. Good evening, Berthe. Can I have a lemon tea? One lemon tea! 2 diamonds. Diamonds, like that? - Yes... - Well I double. 2 no trumps. 3 spades. 4 hearts. Pass. I interviewed Professor Douillet in Bordeaux. He thinks the chap won't stop. He'll always find reasons to go on. He thinks all he does is logical. Doesn't think for an instant that he's mad. Gabriel, you forgot the sugar. On the contrary. He alone is sane, the others are stupid fools. According to the professor, his behaviour will appear normal. In one word, he's mad but no-one knows, not even him. Poor fellow. - The strangler? - Yes. - You pity him? - Yes I do. - Why didn't you say clubs? - Yes... A bad move. He could have taken you down. I never play badly enough to be taken down. I say, you're quite full of yourself. Cut the cards. Here's hoping I get a good deal. Thank you, goodbye. If you don't mind, I'll stop now. Jeantet, take my seat. Playing gets boring. - I'm not imposing? - No, I must be off. We got it already. Good night everyone. I hope I won't be a lousy partner. You're a smart young man. Where are you eating? At the restaurant on market street. It's nice. See you tomorrow Léon. Have a drink. Go back home. Hello, Mr Hatter. You forgot the container. Tonight we have a nice sausage with mashed potatoes. - Yes? - Fine. - Have a nice meal... - Alright! Are you taking something away for your wife? My wife isn't hungry tonight. You won't forget the container? Who goes there? Come on, it was nothing. - Good evening. - Good evening. One rum please. Here's one rum. Can I use the phone? Local call? - Yes. - The booth's over there. Just dial the number. Berthe? Who is this? I'm listening. Can I drop by tonight? At this hour? I've been dying to see you... Impossible, I'm reading a book in bed. Please. What's the matter with you? Please, do me this favour. You should stay by your wife's side. She's asleep. So you ran away like a schoolboy, where are you calling from? From a café. Everyone will know you called me. Not at all. I'm in a booth and I'm keeping my voice down. I promise I won't stay long. Léon, you're nice... I like you but you know I never entertain at night. For once... I'm tired. I'm so comfortable in bed with my book. Please! Go home to bed, drop by tomorrow afternoon. Berthe! No. To tell you the truth, I removed my make-up, and I put my hair curlers in. I'm ugly. So there. I'll ring your doorbell all the same. - I won't open. - You will. No. I'll break down the door. Don't be a naughty hatter. I'm coming. - Who is it? - Léon. Let it go tonight, Léon. Please let me in. You're not being nice. You were never like this before. Have you been drinking? A glass of rum. All men are the same... Well get inside... Sit down Léon. I'll just be a minute, I can't stay like this. Poor old Léon. You're all upset. Are you afraid you'll catch cold? I don't like your moustache. Higher, Léon! - Berthe, come home! - No, stay with me! Stay with me! Please stay. - Stay with me! - BERTHE! Don't hit me... Phone the Superintendent. I did it. I did it. I did it. Mr Labbé. Don't push me, don't hit me. I'm coming.
