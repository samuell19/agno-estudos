I bet they got muskies out there big enough to eat my whole entire body. (laughing) You know, that Grant wasn't lying man, he wasn't. - [May] Lyin', Grant's lyin' in his tomb, dummy. (mumbling) Hey, I don't know how you can handle her. Drinkin', yeah. Hey, come on. - [Kim] Oh May, this is pretty. Hey, what's this? I thought they said nobody ever comes up here. - Leave it to those guys to drag us off to a VFW convention. - Hey, Chuck. Chuckie-poo! - We got company! - [Chuck] Company, we better check this out, come on. Listen, I'll tell ya what. You do me a favor, alright? - [Alan] Alright. - [Chuck] You don't call me Chuckie-poo and I don't bend your nose in. (laughing) - Hope it spoils their whole damn day, especially their thirst. - [Chuck] Damn, man. Look at that. Alright, look at this. Somebody left us a boat, man. Hold that, will ya? Look at that. They even got fishin' poles. - Oh man, aside from the guy that owns this boat, this lake ain't seen action in years. - [Chuck] Man, the way these women are acting, we ain't gonna see action in years, either. - [Alan] Well, we'll see about that. Listen, we better get up and set up camp before it gets dark, right? - [Chuck] You got it guy, let's get going. Come on girls, come on, come on, come on. - [Wallace] Adrianna, Adrianna. Adrianna, it's me, Wallace. I saw it. I saw it. (mysterious music) (laughing) - [Alan] Here, May-sie, have a drink, will ya? - [Chuck] Easy, easy, guy. - [Alan] Sorry about that. - [Chuck] It's alright. - [May] You know something? You two guys are really a drag. - [Alan] Oh come on, May-sie. Relax. Lighten up, have a drink. Enjoy with us. - Forget it, guy. These two city broads here are not gonna be happy 'til they're in sight of Saks Fifth Avenue. Matter of fact, they probably won't be happy 'til we get 'em inside Saks Fifth Avenue. (laughing) - [Alan] You got that right. Oh man, gimme another beer, will ya? - [Chuck] You got it, guy. - Oh yeah, that's just what you need. You know, we're having a wonderful time watching you two bozos suck up booze out here in the boonies. Is it time for bed yet? - Oh yes, beddie time, beddie time. I forgot all about that. You and Chuck get the back of the wagon and Miss Charming and I get the tent. Is that okay with you? - Yeah, unless maybe you girls would like to play a little spin the sleeping bag. Sound like a good idea? - Yeah, it's a terrific idea. With any luck at all, maybe you and W.C. Fields here'll wind up in the sack together. - [Both] Ah, yeah! - [Kim] Those two couldn't do it if we let 'em. You and I get the car, May. - [Alan] Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Isn't that, what, incest or something? - [Chuck] I got an idea. - [Alan] What? - [Chuck] Works like a champ every time. - [Alan] Lay it on me. - I'll take the brown sleepin' bag, you take the green one. - We haven't got a brown one. (tense music) Alright, alright, you guys work the deep water, and we'll work along the edge here and between 'em we'll have the damn muskies surrounded! (mumbling) Whoa. - [May] Be careful, damn you. - [Alan] You gotta slide up by the oars. Come on, May, let's get our gear and get out there and get them muskies! - Oh damn. I'll never come out here again, I'll tell ya that much, Alan. (groaning) Damn! Shit. Damn pine needles. Alan, just how the hell do you expect me to get through this stuff, huh? I need an ax. - [Alan] Ax me no questions, slave person. I lead and you follow. Ew! - [May] Goddammit, Alan. - Be careful. It's bad enough being out here. I don't wanna fall in this black water. ♪ Row row row your boat ♪ ♪ Gently down ♪ - To your local bar for a blast of your favorite brew. Speaking of that, give me a beer, my dear. - [Kim] Again? Alright, I hope this makes you feel better. - Ah! (tense music) (screaming) - [Kim] Chuck, what is it? - [Chuck] Holy mother of pearls! That must've been the biggest muskie granpoppa of 'em all! - [Kim] I wanna go back in! - [Chuck] Oh don't worry, man, Admiral Chuckie's here. Gimme the end of the pole. It's probably already gone, anyway. Ah, come on. - [May] Did you hear Kim scream? - Ha ha, yes. (laughing) That's old Chuck out in the boat, there, trying to make up for being cut off last night. You know my Chuck. In a bed, boat, anything. Now, listen. I wanna move on down this bank here a little farther. I think I can get some better bites. You wanna come along or stay here? - I'm not going one more damn step. - Aw, May. Look, hon, I know you're not having a good time up here, but could you hang on a little longer? I mean if not, just say so and I'll call Chuck and Kim and we'll pack it in and head on home. What do you say? - I don't know, honey. It's just that I don't like it up here in these dark woods. The whole thing bothers me. - Come on, babe, hang on. Just a couple more days. I'll make it up to you when we get back home, I promise. Thanks, babe. - You bet you will. You're gonna take both me and my mother out to dinner. - [Alan] You and your mother? - Chuck, I wanna go home. - [Chuck] For Christ's sake, Kim, it was just a big log or something. Always time complaining. Now, nothing out here's gonna hurt ya. - Chuck, what's happening? (growling) (screaming) - [Chuck] Oh, no. That was May. (dramatic music) (splashing) - [Alan] May! What's wrong May? May, what's wrong, May? May! May! Hey babe, where are you? What's wrong May? May honey. (dramatic music) (whimpering) - [Kim] Chuck, Chuck. - [Alan] May, what's the matter, babe? I hear you May. May! I'm coming, May, where are you? - [Chuck] Say, what happened man? - [Alan] I don't know. - [Chuck] Where is she? - [Alan] I don't know. I checked the campsite, man, she's not there. - [Kim] Well, where is she, then? - [Alan] I don't know. - Now listen, I'll tell you what. You check over there, I'll check over there and you get your ass back to the car and lock yourself in it now. (dramatic music) May! May! May! - [Alan] Jesus Christ. (whimpering) (growling) (screaming) - Brad, I'm telling ya, it's a story and a half. - Are these the two men? - Yeah, yeah, come on. I'll introduce ya. Gentlemen, this is Doc Brad Wednesday, our local M.D. here. Chuck Pierce, Alan Tanner, I believe. - [Alan] Hi Doc. - [Brad] Why don't we move over here out of the way? Sheriff Rydholm here has been telling me a rather incredible story (mumbling). I'm really very, very sorry to hear about your wives and I'm certain that everything humanly possible is being done to find them. Right, Neal? - Yeah, Brad. I've got 25 guys out there now looking for them. If we need more, we'll get 'em. - Well, they will find them, won't they? - Which one of you did something with the boat? - It was me. We were out in the boat and it hit, it was big, it was powerful, like a whale. It just lifted us out of the water. - You know what it is? - Well, there's always been a lot of stories about that lake. I'd give my eye teeth to know what's going on out there now, though. - [Brad] Whose boat was it? - [Chuck] We don't know. It was there when we pulled in. There was fishing tackle-- - Now, wait a minute. It's registered to a guy named Potter, poacher I've been after for years. He uses a DuPont lure for his fish. - [Alan] A what? - Dynamite. (tense music) - [Macweeny] Jesus Christ. Shit. (dramatic music) - Oh my God. Macweeny! Macweeny! - Ginny sent these over. - Yeah, these are just the preliminary reports. She'll be over herself as soon as she finishes up the autopsies. - You know, all this stuff is over my head, Brad, but she's the pathologist, she should know. - Yeah, you know it's sorta like someone was preparing those two girls for embalming, all except pumping the fluid in. - Brad, all they had on them was a few little scratches. No injuries, no breaks, nothing. How the hell can they take the blood out of a body without a significant wound, something? - I don't know. I wish I did, I just don't know. (knocking) Ginny. - Hi. Well, I finally completed the autopsy on the two girls. - [Brad] And, so what's the scoop? - I know how, but the mystery of who, that's up to you, Neal. - [Neal] Ha ha. Wait a minute. Jensen? - [Jensen] Yes, sir? - [Neal] Those two guys that just pulled up out there are coming in to see their wives' bodies and I don't want that to happen. Stop 'em. Right now, right now. - [Jensen] Okay, I'll stop 'em. Hey, sorry to hear about your wives, guys. - [Chuck] Now listen, we just thought we'd come by and see what's happening. - Well yeah, but Sheriff Rydholm doesn't want you to see your wives' bodies until the coroner's done with the autopsy. - [Chuck] Doesn't want us to see the bodies? - That's right. - [Chuck] That's a bunch of bullshit. - [Jensen] Now just take it easy there, pal, alright? - [Chuck] Hey, it's my wife, guy. - [Jensen] Maybe a little later, alright? - [Chuck] Why can't I see it? (stammering) Dammit man, I'm telling ya, that's, cops got the world by the ass. Where's the bottle? I want the bottle. (tense music) - Damn, this makes me mad. Two young lives wasted like that. - What the hell did it? - Who knows? Hey look, you two kick this thing around, huh? I got to get some men up there in that area, just in case. Boy, do I hate that this thing is happening. I doubly hate it because it happened in my county. - [Brad] We'll be here, Neal. - [Neal] Yeah. - Oh, poor Neal. He's blaming himself. There's nothing in the world he could have done. - There's nothing anyone could have done. But I'll tell you one thing for sure. By the nature of those wounds, it wasn't anything human. - But something sharp, thrust down the throat, into the thorax and into the aorta. - Penetrated the largest blood vessel in the body, extracted the blood like a huge siphon. We know how the blood was taken, but by what and why? - Don't look at me. Well, with the proper instruments, I could duplicate the extracting process, but I can't imagine why anyone would want to. - For food? Well, yes. Well, what I mean is, why else would it... Brad, don't look at me that way, and don't think I'm crazy, but could we have a Dracula running loose out there? (dramatic music) (roaring) (screaming) (melancholy music) - [Alan] What's the biggest damn gun you've got up there? - Well, I've got a 12-gauge Magnum with deer slugs. That'd kill a damn whale. You fellas live in this state? - [Chuck] What the hell difference does that make? - Well, you have to be a resident or I can't sell ya anything at all. That's a federal law. - [Alan] That's a bunch of crap. - [Chuck] No, no, that's right. I've heard about it in other states, too. - [Wallace] Gentlemen, I can be of some help. - [Chuck] Who is that? - [Jim] You get the hell outta here, Fry. - [Wallace] Wallace Fry, at your service. - [Jim] You better count your fingers if you shake hands with that creep. - [Wallace] Wallace Fry can get you anything you want. Anything. - [Jim] Yeah, for a buck. - For sure, for a buck. - Hell, that's alright. Everybody's got to make a livin'. Listen, how much you want for that .30-.30? - [Alan] How much for the shotgun? - [Jim] I'll sell ya both guns for $300. That's a good deal. - You got anything more powerful? - Sheriff Rydholm might be real interested in what you guys are fixing to shoot. What you got in mind? - [Ginny] Brad? - [Brad] Hmm? - [Ginny] Here's something. - [Brad] What's that? - Well, it looks like bits of chitin's tissue. - Insect exoskeleton? - I don't know. But it's organic for sure. Could be integument, bits of a carapace. Well, that makes absolutely no sense. - So what does make sense? - Well, the substance was found deeply embedded in the hyoid process. Now if it were merely a piece or a fragment of an insect, how could it have gotten that deeply embedded in her trachea? It had to be driven there with tremendous force. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, just a minute. Are you saying this is a fragment of whatever was used to pierce her throat and withdraw the blood? But Ginny, that's organic material, not some broken off piece of a medical apparatus. Do you have any idea of what you're implying? - Yes, I do. Now I'm almost sure it wasn't a human being that took those lives. - [Brad] Think you can prove it conclusively? - Well, they have an electron scan over at TC Lab. I'd like to look at this fragment at a thousand power. - Well, we've got the fastest cab in the county, let's go. - [Ginny] Good, I'll just give them a call and let them know we're coming in case they have something scheduled. - [Neal] Ginny, Doc. - [Ginny] Neal. - [Neal] Another one. - [Brad] Who is it, Neal? - [Neal] Macweeny. (melancholy music) - [Alan] Damn, man. These mosquitoes up here are big enough to carry my gun. - [Chuck] They can carry mine anytime. (laughing) - [Alan] Dammit man, slow down, will you? (breathing heavily) - [Chuck] Hold it, hold it. Man I am pooped, I mean really pooped. - [Wallace] It's just, it's just a little further. - [Alan] Where the hell are you taking us, man? - [Wallace] Just a little further. Come on, just a little further. Come on, we gotta run, come on. - [Alan] Dammit man, slow down. - [Jensen] Hey, Jim, where do you suppose those guys went yesterday? - [Jim] Out in the woods with that creep Fry, that's where. - [Jensen] With guns? - [Jim] With a 12-gauge Magnum with deer slugs, a Winchester model 94 with 200 rounds of ammunition each. - [Jensen] Holy mother of God, Rydholm's gonna have a fit. - Look, why don't you go ahead? I think I'll track down Neal and ruin his day, too. - Might as well. I don't mind telling you, I'm baffled myself. - Well, it's not every day you run across something like this. - Dinner? - You bet. I'll call you. - [Wallace] Run, gentlemen, just down here. - [Alan] I hope it's close. - [Wallace] Yes, here we are, gentlemen. Right in here. - [Chuck] I don't think I wanna go in there, man. It looks too much like a tomb. - [Alan] I ain't goin' in there, man. - [Wallace] Come in, gentlemen. There's no harm here, come on. (eerie music) Come in gentlemen, come in. Be seated, be seated. - [Chuck] Christ, that was a hell of forest march, guy. - [Alan] Where the hell are we, anyway? - [Wallace] At the home of a friend. My friend and your friend. She can explain many things. - [Chuck] Who's that? - [Wallace] This is Adrianna. She knows what happened at the lake. - What does she know? - Ah, yes. The lake. I know. Pain. Sorrow. I know. - What happened to our wives? - Peace, peace. You will know. I will tell you. In time, in time. - Please, please tell us what you know. - It is known by many names. Namatt, Wahatna, Crad, many names. Ancient, long dead, through all the centuries, but alive. It feasts on blood while awake and once satisfied, it sleeps. Years before, it could sleep a thousand months. Now, too many come deep into the forest and arouse it. So, it must feed again. - Adrianna. Where does it sleep? - In the slime in the bottom of the lake. - That's it. The boat. Kim and I in the boat. We woke it up. - No. It was awakened before you came. - That boat. That guy that had the boat. He's the one that woke it. - I know. I saw him near the water. I knew he'd never return. - Why don't you tell somebody before something like this happens? - And who would believe the old hag of the woods? (growling) (eerie music) - Hey, he's close by. It is here. - Have no fear. It will not harm you. - No, no, we'll be trapped here. (roaring) (Wallace screaming) - Listen, I don't think I understand, Doc. - Well, let me put it this way, Neal. The wound in Mrs. Tanner's throat was caused by something extremely sharp. Oh, I'd say about the length of a nightstick. It was inserted down her throat, into the aorta, but the fragment we found in her throat was organic. Living material from no known organism on Earth. - Doc, what the hell do we have out there? - [Brad] I haven't the vaguest idea, but it's there whether we like it or not. - Like it? Hell, I'm having trouble just believing it. Jesus. - So am I. Well, come on. Let's join Ginny for dinner. - Dinner? How the hell can you eat at a time like this? (eerie music) - [Adrianna] Come not again tonight. Seek the (mumbling) of your bed in the deep, where you will be tested soon. Rest and contemplate your escape from those who harmed you. Rest and let the untroubled eons see through your clouded mind. Rest. - Maybe I'm dense, but what kind of thing would have a hypodemic nerdle for a mouth? I mean, a hypodermic needle. (chuckling) I'm alright. - A lot of insects do. Lice, for instance. Their mouths pierce their prey and suck out the juices. Spiders do the same thing. - You mean to tell me there are breeding bugs nowadays big enough to eat people? You know, I'd call the National Guard out if I thought they'd believe me. - [Brad] You can bet your bottom-dollar they won't. Not until we can produce whatever this is. - I wonder if anybody's ever going to believe what's going on up here. - Some do for sure, Neal. - [Neal] What are you talking about? - I'm talking about those people in the morgue. - [Neal] Well, I've got to say good evening. I got too much to do. - [Ginny] Thanks for coming, Neal. - [Neal] Thank you. - [Brad] Yeah, take care, Neal. - [Neal] Right. - [Brad] Well, can I freshen that up for you? - [Ginny] Thank you. (mellow music) ♪ Walk with me ♪ - Here we go. - [Ginny] Thank you. - Ginny. I suppose this isn't the best time to talk about other things, but-- - [Ginny] What other things? - Us. - I don't mind. - [Brad] Really? - Really. - Ginny, you've been a widow now for over six years. I'd like to change that.

Huh, I don't blame you with what's been going on. I'll tell Rydholm and then get back to you. - [Neal] Tell Rydholm what? - Siegel out by the junction found a car beside the road, windshield smashed, nobody in it. What do you think? - Junction? Well, that's right by the lake if you take the snowmobile trails. Now, who's on the road? - Siegel, Weldon and Hess, why? - Well, you tell 'em to meet me at the junction and stop all cars goin' in. - [Alan] Well, like I just said a few minutes ago, we talked with Adrianna last night and she said this thing sleeps in the slime at the bottom of Bog Lake. - [Ginny] Well, did she say what it looks like? - [Chuck] No, no, no, no. She's only told us exactly what we just told you. - Well, look. Why don't you two go get cleaned up and have a big breakfast, huh? That's a prescription, huh? We'll tell Rydholm about Adrianna and Wallace Fry. Run along, we'll talk to you later. (talking over each other) - Well, that sort of backs up our theory, right? - Yes, but we haven't the foggiest idea of what in the hell this thing is, what it looks like or even how to knock it out. Oh, there's Neal now, come on. - Oh, okay. - Sleeps at the bottom of the lake? Christ, I must be dreaming this whole crazy thing. - I know how you feel, Neal. Look, they didn't teach this sort of lunacy in medical school, either. - Amen to that. (knocking) - [Neal] Yah? - [Chuck] Sheriff, what are you people doing? - [Neal] Slowly losing our marbles, you? - We know what you mean. It's catching. - [Neal] What can I do for ya? - You can tell us what you're gonna do about whatever's at the bottom of that lake. - You look, we're gonna set off a charge in that lake and if there's anything in there, it'll float up dead. - [Alan] We'll be there. - That's a pretty drastic move, Neal. - He's right. I think you should be very cautious. - That's really neat, lady, you think we should be very cautious. Meanwhile, that thing, whatever it is, is running around out there waiting to grab off someone else's wife while you sit there and say, "I think we should be very cautious." - Full circle, half ended. Rounded tips of time. Broken, mended. Mended, broken. Breaths of stone, no blood but all blood. The silence of screams. (growling) Blow away summer when we now so soon. Oh, come then. Come. (growling) - Anywhere in there Corky. - [Alan] Hi Sheriff. - [Neal] Hello there. - [Chuck] Christ, it's awful small. I mean, what the hell is it? - It's a block of the new RDX. You just watch. Okay. (mumbling) Get your ass over there. Get the boat out of the water. - [Corky] Yeah. - [Neal] You got it. (melancholy music) - Sheriff, let me ask you something. Do you really think this stuff of yours is really gonna work? - [Neal] If there's anything down there, it's gonna work. Corky! Okay! (booming) - Jesus Christ, there ain't any fish alive in there, now. - Well, nothing else is, either. Come on, Corky. Let's get outta here. (engine rumbling) - Now, Goddammit, man. I know there's something in there. - [Alan] Hell man, they don't believe us. - [Corky] You see how that one looked at me when I got back in the car? - [Neal] Yeah, I did. (gunshots popping) What the hell is that? - [Corky] I don't know. - [Neal] Well, something's happening back there. We better go take a look, huh? - [Corky] Yeah. - [Neal] Jesus. (dramatic music) Where the hell is it? - [Corky] I don't know. - Get down there, look. Corky, look, look, look! Look over there, look! (dramatic music) Rydholm here! (Corky screaming) (dramatic music) Jesus, son of a bitch! - Good God, look at that. - [Neal] Well, where's Rydholm? - [Jensen] Oh Doc, don't ask. He's in a foul mood. - Can you blame him? I'm terribly sorry about Corky. It's just awful. - Yeah, well, Corky and Macweeny were my friends. Them two other guys had some pretty heavy guns with 'em, Doc, for all the good it done 'em. They put a lot of lead into the air before they went down. I guess Corky never had a chance, though, Rydholm said. - They did hit it, though? - I don't see how they coulda missed. Them guys had firepower. I think they knocked this glob of stuff off it with a shot. - Welp, maybe they didn't hit it with enough force. - [Jensen] I think you can pump that thing full of lead and it'll keep on coming no matter what. (phone ringing) - Excuse me. Hello? Oh yes, Neal. Yes, he's right here. - Well, will you tell him to get back here on the double, Ginny, huh? Thank you. (phone ringing) Hello? Rydholm here. Yeah. This you, Terry? Oh yeah, everything's fine but I do have a problem, huh? Yeah, I wondered if you and a couple of your boys could come down here and help me with a drowned body search? Uh huh. Oh great, great. Yeah, Terry, this could be pretty bad, so don't bring any lightweights with ya, huh? Yeah, no, no, no. I'll tell ya when you get here. Okay, bye. - [Jensen] Want me, Neal? - Yeah, I want you, Jensen. I want you to get a bunch of volunteers and go up to the lake and close off every trail and every road that goes in there. Make sure there's nobody in there. I don't want anymore bodies outta there. I want you and Siegel to go in and get the old hag Adrianna out of her shack there. You got it? - [Jensen] Yes, sir. But, Sheriff? What do we tell the gentry when we turn them back at the roadblocks? - Well, you tell the gentry that if they don't like it, they don't have to vote for me at the next election. - [Ginny] That's strange. - So is that. Several positive reactions, and now a negative one, all in the same series. - Well, it could be an abnormal amount of heparin in the blood serum. - Yeah, could be. Heparin is an anti-coagulant. - Yes, but why a very complex organic serum that stops blood from clotting? - Well, wait. Whatever this thing is, if it requires blood, it would want it to flow freely, right? Like a mosquito, it would add an anti-coagulant just to pump out the blood more easily. - Yes, but a mosquito only leaves you with an itch. Our mystery monster is far more sinister. - Yeah, that's an understatement. - Brad? If I see what I think I see, sinister is a frightening understatement. Take a look at this. - Oh my God. It looks like malignant cells. Subcellular organelles. The mitochondria. - Look at the Farber glass. - Ginny, is it possible that we have a walking, breathing, living one hundred percent cancerous organism out there? - Slime sample seems to indicate that possibility. Damn, I just don't have the proper equipment here to do a truly definitive test. Oh, did you notice the crystalline structure of the cells? - Yes, I did. - What did you make of it? - Now, wait a minute. I'm over my head as it is. Don't forget, I'm just a country sawbones, not a trained pathologist like you. - [Ginny] Don't be modest, Doctor. Give me another slide, will you? - [Brad] Here. - [Ginny] I stained the dense part of the slime tissue. - Did it stain alright? - Perfectly. My God, this is bizarre. You know, I could almost swear I, I was looking at a metallurgical cross-section of a six B group metal. - Six B group metal? Let's see, on the periodic table that would be uh... Whoo boy. It's been a long time since I looked at that. Uh, let's see, it'd be chromium, molybdenum, and that'd be tantalum. - Very good, Doctor. First two are correct, but the third is tungsten, not tantalum. - Well, two out of three isn't too bad for a country sawbones, is it? (chuckling) (smooching) (mumbling) - [Jensen] Wait until you see this hag, Chris. You won't believe it. Sight for sore eyes, let me tell ya. Watch yourself over here. Watch your step. See what we got here. (eerie music) - [Chris] What'd you find in there? - [Jensen] Aw, nothing but a pile of junk. You oughta take a look in there. You won't believe it. - [Chris] I'll take your word for it. - [Jensen] Hey, you know what she's using to sleep on in that back room? Dried up, smelly old fish skins. - [Chris] Fish skins? You gotta be kidding me. - [Jensen] No, let's go see if she's wandering around here someplace, huh? (mellow music) - [Leonard] Hi Neal. - [Neal] Leonard. (horn honking) Hey Terry! - [Terry] Hey, Neal. - [Neal] How are ya? - [Terry] Just great. How are you? - Boy, is it good to see you. - [Terry] How's it goin'? Okay? - [Neal] Real good. Who's your buddy here? - That's Bill Beckley. - [Neal] Hey Bill, how are ya? - [Bill] How you doin', Sheriff? - [Neal] Real good, where's the other guy? - We figured we can do it just the two of us. We don't need the other guy. - [Neal] Oh, that's alright, okay. - Alright. - [Neal] Yeah, you need any more gear? - No, we brought everything. We even brought two bang sticks in case we see a big muskie. - [Neal] We got 'em, alright. Come on in, I'll give ya a short one and tell you what the score is. - [Terry] Okay, alright. That sounds good, let's go man. - [Neal] It's good to see you, man. (mumbling) - [Jensen] (mumbling) I got my orders that nobody can go down there. - [Sid] Well, there's a lake down there. I been fishing there for 14, 15 years. I don't understand it. - [Jensen] Hell, I know, Sid, but I got my orders. (dramatic music) - Animal, mineral, mineral, animal. What, no vegetable? - No vegetable. These are mucus producing cells with a crystal shape. - Oh my gosh. Yin and yang, hot and cold, positive and negative. Eh, it's a (mumbling). An absolute logical inconsistency. - And right in front of our eyes. You know the crazy thing that was running through my mind? Living fossil, breathing stone, mineralized tissue and slimy. - It's strange, but every time I look out at those bogs, those glacial lakes, I can't help but think. 15,000 years ago they were covered with ice. 10,000 years ago it began to melt. I've always wondered, what would have happened beneath that glacial carpet? What strange forms of life could have existed those millions of years ago only to be caught, trapped, crushed and held under the ice mass, waiting for the first warm days to come, slumbering in the ooze, just waiting. - [Woman] Oh, I gotta good spot over here. Stop. (mysterious music) (dramatic music) (screaming) (roaring) - [Neal] Well, I can only say I'm glad it's you two and not me diving down there. Good luck and be careful, huh? - Neal, don't worry. We're born careful. - [Neal] Well, you better be. Over that way. Come on. To my left, you guys. Terry, over there. - [Terry] Okay, alright, okay. - [Neal] Gotta go straight back now. - [Terry] Alright. - [Brad] Hey, Neal. - [Neal] To your left. - [Brad] What are you doing with the scuba divers out there? - Well, we're trying to find out what's out there. - What do you expect to find out there? - [Neal] Who knows? (splashing) (eerie music) - Sheriff! Sheriff! Pull us in! Quick! Quick! - Neal, Neal. There's something in the water behind them. - [Terry] Hell, hell, what is it? (dramatic music) (tense music) - Neal, don't pull in the boat. They may need it. - [Neal] They'll never need it or anything else for that matter. (dramatic music) - It's definitely some sort of a reproductive organism. Not exactly a seed and not exactly an egg. Something in between the two. - [Brad] Or outside of both. - Well, I guess the only thing to do is get inside of 'em. - Wait a minute, hon. Look, why don't we play this thing safe? Take it over to TC Lab? They have an isolation chamber, mechanical manipulators and we have no idea what's inside those things. - You're right. I guess I was just overanxious. Come in. - Doc, Ginny. - [Ginny] Hi Jensen. - Well, we got another one. Girl, 20 year old. Got past the roadblock on a bike. Girlfriend was with her, but she managed to get away. Rydholm has a sketch of whatever it is and wants to know if you want to see it. - Do we? - You bet we do. - She says this looks like what she saw. I think she was on angel dust myself. - Well, it has that pointed mouth part that we theorized about. - Mmm. You know it has kind of an aquatic look about it, too. - Yeah, but remember this poor girl was scared half to death when she saw this thing, so any aspect of it could be way out of proportion. - Oh, we're taking that productive cell the divers found over to the TC Lab. Maybe they can help us crack this mystery. - [Neal] What do you think they'll find? - Who knows? - I feel like a drink, you? - [Ginny] No, thanks. - [Brad] Yeah, I'll have one, thanks. - Sure. Oh boy, oh boy. Here ya go, Doc. (crashing) (tense music) - [Jim] Something's gotta happen in town one way or another. - [Jensen] How you doin', fellas? Getting ready to close up Jim? - [Jim] Yeah, we might as well. There's nobody out and about these days after dark. - [Jensen] Well, I don't blame 'em. I'd be home myself if I wasn't on duty. Ah, gimme some double aught, huh? (mellow music) - [Jim] Charge these to the county? - [Jensen] Hell yes, I'm gonna use 'em for the county. Too damn big for ducks. Okay, Jim, what the hell's going on? - [Jim] Dammit, we're gonna do something about that thing out there in that lake. - [Jensen] Something like what? - [Man] Kinda like seeing what six cases of 80 percent will do with it. - [Jensen] 80 percent? Christ, Rydholm's already used stuff ten times stronger than that. - Yeah well, maybe, but maybe not in the right spot. Anyhow, we're gonna try it, and if it doesn't work, I'm leaving town because it's not safe anymore. - You guys are crazy. Rydholm's gonna have your mortal asses if he finds you messing around out there. Christ, that whole area is off limits. - [Man] The hell with Rydholm. If he can't kill that thing, by God we will. - [Jim] You gonna tell Rydholm about this? - Tell him what? That all of you lunatics are lunatics? Christ, he knows that already. Christ, he probably even knows what you're thinking. Well, goodbye dummies. - Maybe he's right. Maybe we should tell Rydholm and if he doesn't do it, then we will. - [Man] Whatever you say, we'll follow you. - Brad, why would anyone want to steal 'em? - They weren't stolen, look. - Oh my God. It came here for them. - Yeah, right into town. I better call Neal. Those roadblocks are useless. - Brad, I got all the units coming back into town. I think we need 'em a lot more here than out there. - Look, I've been thinking. With all the information we've gathered so far, we just may have enough to go after it. - [Neal] How? - Well you see, we know it needs blood. We could use that as a lure. - We've been thinking of building a blood-scent generator. We'll get it upwind from the lake and then fill the air with the scent of blood. - Neal, it should be hungry by now, and it just might work. - Yeah, but there's only one problem. The chemical composition of this thing is very complex. How do we capture it? - [Neal] Well, how 'bout using Rotenone, you know, the stuff that Fish and Game Commission uses to kill the fish in the lakes when they want to restock 'em? Think it'll work, Ginny? - Sounds feasible. How do you apply it? - [Neal] I'll get the fire department in on it. They got the hoses, they'll spray everything. - [Brad] Okay, okay, we'll build the scent generator, but we're gonna need some help in getting this thing directed in the direction we want it to. - [Neal] Alright, I'll get all the volunteers you want in front of my office in the morning. How many you want? - All you can get. - [Neal] You got 'em. I'll see you in the morning. - [Brad] Okay. - [Ginny] Well, why don't we look in the storeroom and see what we can find? - Is that a proposition, lady? - Why Dr. Wednesday. This works on propane. Maybe we can improvise a vaporizer. Well, at least it's a start. - What are you, some sort of a female Rube Goldberg? - Do you have a better idea? - Not for a vaporizer. - Well, you work on that and I'll work on this. - [Man] We wanna talk to you, Sheriff. - [Man In Glasses] Yeah, come out here, Sheriff. - [Neal] So you shall, gentlemen and I want to talk to you, too. - [Man] About this creature at the lake, we feel it's time something be done. - I couldn't agree with you more, and I applaud your civic sense of duty. Now, if you gentlemen will gather every able bodied man in the area and meet me out here at six in the morning, we'll go after it. Does that suit you? - [Man] Yeah well, exactly what are we gonna do? - Very good, gentlemen, very good. I'll see you at six in the morning. Don't forget now, get everybody you can. (chuckling) (siren blaring) (dramatic music) - [Neal] Come on. Get up here, we gotta get up here. Gonna send this stuff down that way. (dramatic music) Come on, come on. Hold it, hold it, hold it. (mumbling) Set it all up over there. (mumbling) in the place. Have it all coming this way, downwind, huh? Everybody's all set. You call the shot whenever you want. - [Brad] Well, it looks perfect. - The wind is exactly right. The blood scent should go just where we want it. - [Jensen] And probably calling every damn mosquito in the state. - [Brad] Well, if this idea pays off, I can take a few mosquitoes. - [Neal] You heard the man, Jensen, get cracking. Okay, let's clear the area. - [Brad] Set up the sprayers. We have no idea how fast this thing can move. - [Man] I'll never argue with Rydholm again. This plan's gone well. - [Brad] Yeah, yeah it is. (dramatic music) - [Neal] That stuff stinks. What is it, garlic bombs? - [Brad] It's something Ginny concocted. Does smell a little rank though, doesn't it? - [Ginny] Rank isn't the word. Rotten is more like it, but at least it's working. - [Brad] Let's just hope it smells like ham and eggs to that thing. I'm going back to the generator. (dramatic music) - [Ginny] Neal! Neal! No, not that way! Neal, my God, Neal! - [Brad] What's the matter? - [Ginny] Oh, Brad, Brad! He went right in the center of the blood scent! - [Jensen] I'll get him. - [Brad] No, no, hold it. With that smell on you, you're a dead man. - [Ginny] Oh God, Brad. (dramatic music) (screaming) (roaring) - [Adrianna] Go back, go back, it's a trap! (roaring) - [Jensen] My God. (screaming) - [Brad] Hit the spray, damn you, hit the spray. (creature groaning) That's enough, shut it off. (dramatic music) Dead? - [Ginny] I don't know. I can't tell. - Wait a minute, don't shoot it. We want it alive. Come on fellas, hurry up with those nets. Be sure those Rotenone soaked nets are all around him. Wrap up carefully. Wrap him good and then let's get him in the truck, down to the lab. Easy. (tense music) Into the truck. I really appreciate it, John. Oh yes, of course we'll meet you. Right. Thanks. - Thank goodness John is coming. Maybe he can figure this thing out. - Well, if anyone can, he can. - I'll just never understand why Neal ran out there in the first place. - Well honey, Neal was a man of action. When he saw this thing, he just naturally went after it. That was his nature. - Oh Brad, I miss him so much. - Yeah I know. (engine rumbling) (footsteps clacking) - [John] Now when you grab the nose, just slow it up. That's it, now we got it. I'll take care of the windshield. - [Brad] Alright, John. - [John] Brad, Ginny. - [Ginny] Hi, John. - [John] Take your time, we'll make it better. Get a hand on it. There's the money. - [Brad] Thank you. - [John] Okay, now you got it. Good to see you both. - [Brad] Good to see you. I'm sure glad you could make it on such short notice. - [John] Oh I had to give up my double lecture, but big deal. Why the devil didn't you call me about this thing sooner? - [Brad] Well, we didn't know what it really looked like until now. Well, this definitely seems fish-like. - [John] Fish-like, huh? Suppose you let me decide what looks fish-like? - That's why we called our favorite ichthyologist. - We really need a second opinion, John. - Well, you've got it. Had a good look at the bogs flying over. They could be the natural habitats of all sorts of things we don't know about. - Well, let's take a closer look. - Fine. - [Brad] Come on. - [John] It's incredible. If I didn't see it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it. - [Brad] How'd you like a DNA reading on this thing? What a (mumbling) that'd make, huh? - [John] How soon can we get one? - Well, I'm sending some tissue samples off to a colleague of mine on the coast. We'll have DNA data very quickly, if I know my friend. - [John] This old woman, Adrianna? - [Ginny] Mmm hmm. - [John] How is she connected to this? - We don't know how, but she was. - There was no question about it. Tried to warn this thing when Neal was killed. - You said she lived out there alone, yet the creature didn't harm her, why? Why wasn't her blood drained, just like all the others? - [Ginny] Take a look at this blood serum analysis I ran on Adrianna. - [Brad] Now take a look at the other one. - Well, they're se-- wait a minute. - I thought that would surprise you. The other one is this beast. - [John] They're virtually identical. - Right. It's some sort of a blood affinity. But we don't know how, why or what. - Well, without a DNA report, I wouldn't attempt a (mumbling). - [Ginny] Well, the sooner we get these samples off, the sooner we'll have an answer. So, why don't you two get out of here and let me get to work? - [Brad] Okay, well I'll pick you up in about an hour. Does that give you enough time? - [Ginny] That sounds fine. - [Brad] Come on, John, I'll buy you a drink. (tense mysterious music) - [John] It's conceivable Adrianna was transfused by the creature. It injected her with its blood. - But that would have killed her. - Yes, you would think so, but perhaps there's a fact that we don't know about, Something that would make such an injection feasible. How long do you say she lived in this area? - Oh boy, ever since I was a little kid and that's been over 40 years ago, why? - Well, the coroner's report indicated she was very old, but nobody can say how old. - That's right and mixed up with that thing. - Do know what I think it could be? - [Brad] What's that? - The creature can't reproduce itself without the help of a human female, but with the vast incompatibility of vital body fluids, it must do something to modify it, so it injects its own blood, after which, the victim willingly participates. - Well in Adrianna's case, she might have even wanted to. - But that blood injection could affect the brain, cause an aberration so wild it makes the victim willing. - Well, she's dead and that's that. - Not quite. The creature got away with the egg cluster. When those eggs hatch, and that brood begins to look for more human females, then what? - Boy. John, you really picked up my day. Look, you wanna head back to the hotel and I'll check with you later, huh? - Fine. - And thanks again for coming. - [John] No problem. (tense mysterious music) (growling) (gasping) (dramatic music) (crashing) (roaring) (screaming) (mumbling) (tense music) - John, John. Oh thank God I caught you. Listen, I just tried to call Ginny at the lab and there's no answer. I have a feeling something's wrong. Will you meet me over there? Oh great, yeah right, thanks. (growling) (dramatic music) Jensen, call all units and tell 'em to get over to Ginny's lab at 82nd and Lacey right away. - [Jensen] Okay, Doc. Calling all units. (roaring) (tense music) (siren blaring) - [Brad] Ginny! Ginny! - [John] Don't be a fool, Brad. Nothing could live in that. Brad, look. - Her shoe. He's got her. (flames crackling) (tense music) (mumbling) (roaring) (growling) (tense music) Hell, there no sign of him. What if he's headed for someplace else? What if he's not headed for Bog Lake? - Cut it out, Doc. What if's are a nickel a pound. We'll get him. - He needs her, John. Doesn't have Adrianna anymore. Just gotta catch him before he infuses her. - Hope to God it's not too late. (siren blaring) (tense music) - [Brad] John, I thought I saw something over there. - [John] Let's check it. - Yeah, that's a slime trail alright. Jensen, he's headed for the bog. Get everybody down there right away. We'll follow on foot. (tense music) (roaring) (siren blaring) (dramatic music) (growling) It's not much further. (dramatic music) (roaring) (gunshots popping) Ginny! Ginny run, it's Brad! (roaring) Ginny, wake up! It's Brad! (dramatic music) (roaring) (gunshots popping) (siren blaring) (roaring) (crashing) (dramatic music) (flames crackling) (roaring) (dramatic music) (melancholy music) (mysterious music) (melancholy music) - [John] The creature got away with the egg cluster. When those eggs hatch and that brood begins to look for more human females, then what?
