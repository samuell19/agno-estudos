ALL THAT YOU POSSESS This is where he threw himself under the train. April 14, 1979 He said the voices in his head wouldn't let him leave the tracks. It's a miracle he survived. He sustained multiple injuries, and his right hand was shredded. When he woke up in the hospital, he couldn't remember who he was. Apparently, he was reciting French poetry. He was transferred to a psychiatric hospital in Warsaw... and then went to live with his mother in the country. That's where he wrote his book To Come to Terms with the World, with his left hand, of course. He never finished it. One day... he went to his apartment in Warsaw... and hanged himself. You've reached Pierre Leduc. Leave me a message and I'll call you back. FOUND MY DREAMS AGAIN THE DREAMS ONCE PUT IN MY POCKET FULL OF HOLES WHEN AT NIGHT AN ENORMOUS RAVEN FLEW TO THE CLEAR RIVER, THE GOOD RIVER That night bats devoured all the stars White butter?ies Only black butter?ies remained Truth became like the moon rolling over a smooth mirror for four weeks So there you are. Everybody's been looking for you all week. Was in the country. What are you doing? I'm leaving. Where are you going? Nowhere. Home. I'm resigning. What? I'm leaving the university. I've got a bunch of boxes. Can you give me a ride? Will you finish your thesis? - What about your class? - They'll get a replacement. A month before the term ends? Listen, can't do this any more. - Do what? - Any of it! Teach students who can't read or write, put up with faculty... If hear "collective agreement" or "lexical frequencies" once more, I'm going to hit someone. This isn't a literature department, for Christ's sake. It's an accounting firm. - Pierre, what's going on? - don't know. You could apply for sick leave. I'm not sick. "AUTUMN" LOST, ENGULFED IN THE GARDENS OF RUST-RED AUTUMN TEARING OFF THE LEAVES ONE BY ONE LIKE THE HOURS OF EXISTENCE You've reached Pierre Leduc. Leave me a message and I'll call you back. Pierre, it's your father. I've been trying to reach you for a week. Call me back. It's important. Goodbye. Lost engulfed in the gardens of rust-red autumn tearing off the leaves one by one like the hours of existence Going from tree to tree from pain back to pain A silent walk of suffering that does not awaken the sleeping wind Tearing off the leaves with no regret with a sad, warm smile Leaving the very last one to someone else before dying You're leaving? You have no idea what this does to me You can't keep leaving and coming back. This has to stop. But you're my only friend. I'm sorry. Pierre! Your father wants to see you. Get in. Get in! Son of a bitch! You knew the balcony wasn't safe! A 5-year-old girl is in the hospital because of you! She might not ever walk again! Look at me, Leduc! If she doesn't get better, I'll see you in hell! Hello, Pierre. How's your mother? How do you expect? Is that what you wanted to see me about? Would you like a coffee or something? No, thanks. Get me a scotch, would you? Still at the university? Yes. Still lecturing? Yes. Have a seat. Pierre, I'm dying. Have cancer. It's spread everywhere. The doctors don't give me three months. - There's nothing they can do? - Apparently not. I'm sorry. I'm leaving the company to you. Don't want it. You don't have to run it yourself. It's awful what you're going through. I'm sad for you. But don't want that money. - Why not? - Because it's dirty. - What'? - It's dirty money, Dad. You've been screwing people over for 40 years. You screwed your employees and your partners. You bribed politicians. You're a crook. You can't deny it. Do you know how much it's worth? Don't care. Over $50 million. Do whatever you want with it. It's yours. Won't take it. You're getting it anyway. Won't take it. THOSE LOST IN THE CITY JUNGLE - THROUGH MY FAULT THE HORROR OF A COLD EMBRACE - THROUGH MY FAULT THE LACK OF LOVE AND TENDERNESS - THROUGH MY FAULT HEARTLESS, PASSIONLESS THROUGH MY FAULT Hello. Was in your class at university. Were you? Did they find someone to fill in? Yeah, a McGill student. Good. Are you here to sell some books? Yes. Put them there. We only accept French books. Of course. There are some real gems here. Yeah. What are you doing now? Translating. Translating what? Some poems by Edward Stachura. I've never heard of him. He had a huge youth following in Poland. He sold 100,000 copies of his poetry collections. He translated Gaston Miron. Is he still alive? He killed himself in 1979. So why are you selling your books? What's it to you? I'm just curious. Need the room. The barefoot in the streets of the world The naked in the streets of the world The hungry in the streets of the world Through my fault Through my fault Through my most grievous fault! Horror - there is no end to horror Murder - there is no end to murder War - there is no end to war Through my fault Through my fault Through my most grievous fault! Dad? Just wanted to see how you were doing. This was your great-grandfather's house. You've never talked about him was born here. We lived with my grandparents. The farm should've gone to my father, but there was a fight and my grandfather kicked us out. What was the fight about? Don't really know. They probably didn't agree on how to manage the land. My grandfather lost his temper. My father had worked for him for free for 10 years. There was nothing in writing. My parents lost everything overnight. They already had four children by then. We moved to Quebec City. Dad found work at the port. He refused to ever set foot here again. How old were you when you left? Five. When heard the property was for sale, bought it. Life's strange, isn't it? Got my lawyers to rezone the area. We're turning it into a resort, like the one on the other side of the river. We just have to clear a few trees. We'll have a great view of the St. Lawrence and the islands. Why a vacation community? We'll build about 50 cottages, scattered throughout the woods. Not too close together. And we'll keep as many trees as we can. There'll be a community center where the farm buildings are, with a convenience store, a hall and a few guestrooms. We'll keep the old exteriors intact, wherever possible. You never considered leaving it the way it was? A piece of land like this? An hour and half away from the city? If don't do it, someone else will. Anyway... when it's yours, you can do what you want with it. Told you won't take it. It would be a nice place to write, though. You'd feel right at home in that little house. My will is with Dutil & Associates on Grande-Allee. Let it go, Dad. It's a done deal. There's nothing you can do about it. You're my son. It belongs to you. THERE IS NO END TO THE CRYING - THROUGH MY FAULT SOME COLLAPSE IN SILENCE - THROUGH MY FAULT WHILE OTHERS TURN THEIR BACKS - THROUGH MY FAULT WITH MORE AND MORE PEOPLE AROUND - THROUGH MY FAULT HUMAN BEINGS ARE MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND Hello, Denise. We're here to see you. Come here. Come here, dear. Come see your mother. Sorry. can't do this. LIKE A REGRET GUILTY OR INNOCENT WE ARE ALIVE WHILE SO, SO, SO MANY ARE DEAD LIKE A DRY SOB IN THE MIDST OF A RAINY NIGHT LIKE A PERFECTLY INFLICTED WOUND THAT MUST BE LICKED LIKE A PULVERIZED HEART THAT MUST BE MENDED What else is there to say? I'm leaving for Poland in August. You're finishing your degree. Our options are limited. And what's your solution? You can't keep it. - You want me to have an abortion? - Yes. It's your decision, obviously. What do you want me to say? - Didn't make this baby on my own. - What do you want to do? Drop out of school? Sub at a high school to make ends meet? For a baby we never even wanted? How do you know don't want it? Do what you like, but don't want kids. Not now, not ever. - It's a bit late now. - You can't force a baby on me! I'm not forcing anything on you. You made this baby. How can even be sure I'm the father? GOVERNMENT OF QUEBEC STAFF DIRECTORY Hello? Yes, speaking. I'm on my way. Sir? You're Mr. Leduds son? Yes. Your father has had a severe stroke. The clot originated in his heart. He has end-stage cancer? Yes. Under the circumstances, if he does regain consciousness... his body and mind will be severely damaged. So we can keep him on artificial life support... or let nature take its course and make sure he's not in any pain. Are you his next of kin? Yes. What do you think? Let him go. Was 12 when my parents split up. My mother suffered from depression. She drank. He left when things started to get really bad. She couldn't take care of me. went to live with my aunt Francoise. Once a year, he would take me to a hockey game. Then he'd give me $100 and he'd be gone for another year. Did you miss him? Don't know why, but just couldn't hate him. He thought he was a good man, and in a way he was. He was generous, when it suited him. But deep down, he was just a scam artist. He was cold-blooded. He'd put a family out on the street, like that. But know he helped plenty of people out of a bind. Go figure. When did you stop seeing him? When was 18. That's the summer went to work for him in his office. For six weeks, mailed out letters threatening tenants who were behind on their rent and promising repairs that never got done. Quit before the end of the summer. I'd had it. He was furious. When told him was going to study literature, he said was on my own. He wouldn't waste his money on such nonsense. Didn't see him again until got back from Poland. - You're the one who called him? - Yeah. He pretended like nothing happened and gave me tickets to a show. Nana Mouskouri, for Christ's sake! Your mother... did he take care of her? He paid the bills. That's it. Don't think he ever went to see her Right now, you're worth about $53 million. Your father said you would waive the inheritance. You have six months to do that. But first, listen to me. - Mr. Dutil... - Let me finish. You've become a millionaire without lifting a finger. You have no idea what went into building this fortune. And you despise the people behind it. Do you want the truth, Pierre? You're an unremarkable man, even after spending half your life buried in books. Listen up. Know you've left the university. You're out of work. You're in debt. A miracle just fell into your lap. A miracle isn't something you can turn down. If you're not interested in running the company, we can do that on your behalf. You don't like thinking about money? With $50 million, you'll never have to think about it again. You want to move to the country and read for the rest of your life? No problem. Feel like moving to Paris? Go right ahead. Or flying off to Venice for the weekend? Call the travel agent. Freedom, Pierre... Do you know how much freedom... $50 million buys? Now, come with me. We built this on land nobody else wanted. Look at it now: 300 stores, all high-end, 100% occupancy, parking for 5,000, packed with people all the time. Your father had to talk the first investors into it. They've never regretted it, trust me. And here, 120 people get a steady paycheque because of us. Carpenters, painters, electricians... That's food on 120 tables because of the jobs we created. Let's go look at the model unit. Your father built this. The most luxurious apartments in Quebec City. An incredible view of the Plains of Abraham. Do you want to see the bachelor unit on the ninth floor? Another time. I'm going home - Want a drive? - No,thanks. I'll walk. Pierre... Give this some serious thought. You know where to find me. Like a dry sob in the midst of a rainy night a heavy block of stone a block of stone will stand on it it will crush me it will crush me will rise from underneath That comes to $137.50. Can double that if you take it in store credit. I'd like it in cash, please. Fill this out. need your address and signature. Thank you. Mr. Leduc? A lot of us students enjoyed your class. You... don't know how to put this You made literature seem important. Thank you. Sir! - What is it? - You recognized my mother the other day don't remember. Do. You recognized her and then you looked at me. Told you don't remember. What do you want? - Are you my father? - That's ridiculous. Then say no. But you knew my mother? Don't know who you mean. Leave me alone. Why did you run away? Didn't run away. was in a hurry. So you recognized me? How many times do have to say no? Now get lost! I've got work to do.

Then... told her didn't want children and was leaving for Warsaw. Just like that? Just like that. Left. never called. Neither did she. Spent five years in Poland. When got back, didn't look her up. Why not? Why didn't you look her up? Thought having a child would keep me from doing what wanted. You never felt bad that she was stuck raising me on her own? Do you want the truth? Yeah.
