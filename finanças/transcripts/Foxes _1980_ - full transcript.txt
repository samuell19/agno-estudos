Just a few minutes past 7:00 in the morning. Hi, I'm Jeff Conzer. And it's time to wake up. I know you feel that it's completely... Wrong. No, but you're ready to wake up, aren't you? - Yes, definitely. - Good. It's going to be a beautiful day today. Temperatures in the mid 70s in the city... a little cooler at the beaches... and warmer in the valleys. As always. You gotta wake up. No arguing. It's time to stick your finger in your third eye... and at least wake yourself up. You even have to get your dog awake. It's just time to wake up. Everybody, get up! Wake up! Hey, shake your bootie. Jeanie, don't stay in there. I'm not even in there yet. Oh, Christ. We got to wake up Annie. Annie. Annie, wake up. - Is Annie awake? - Not yet. I didn't hear her come in. I was totally vegged. She was sick all over some guy's car. Yeah? From what? Quaaludes, beer, wine, some real heavy pills. Poor thing. Teenage dopers, what a waste. Don't do that. The Three Stooges always throw it. She can't do that. She'll drown. I'm only saying that's what the Three Stooges always do. I'm not saying she should do it. She ditches one more time, that's it. They'll flunk her and throw her in the street. - Forget it. - What does that mean? I mean, what the shit? Please. She doesn't care if she never wakes up. Morning, Annie. What are you guys looking at? Oh, God! Oh, my gosh. You're not gonna eat that? - I am really hungry. - That's disgusting. Tomorrow you'll complain. Let me rub it on your thighs. You're such a dummy. I think you're hilarious. Get your hands off there. I'm gonna eat that. I want that. You'll eat it all. You guys are really pissed at me. How's your head? A whole bunch of people just moved in. - I'm gonna barf. - You don't look sick. I am. I got a case of the munchies. Anybody want to ditch and go to the beach? I got a hair appointment at Saks. - You said I couldn't ditch. - Just Phys Ed. What are you doing with your hair? Mom's after me to have it chopped like Dorothy Hamill. She doesn't dig me wearing her clothes... and having all the guys think I'm mature. Like they'd be coming onto me and not looking at her. Get them to chop your head instead, Deirdre. That's pretty retarded, considering who was sick... all over that guy's car last night. - Who cares? - He cares. Don't you? I didn't even know him. Besides, it was this really gross Trans Am... with some jerk-off dragon blowing smoke over the hood. - Was he cute? - Who? The geek in the car, geekaloid. The only geek I know is Randy Teratunian. - So? - You think he's hot. - I do not. - You want to go with him. I never said I want to go with him. I said I want to ball him. Excuse me. Did you tell your dad that you were staying at my house? I gotta call him. Guess what? For an elaborate change, we are late again. I don't believe this. Come on. I'm always getting tardies. - Anybody seen my keys? - Not again. - Have you seen the keys? - I don't know. My keys! Where'd you leave 'em? Who knows? It's not my house. Can I listen to "Abbey Road"? Whenever I need to mellow out, I listen to "Abbey Road." We're going to school, retardo. When I'm 18, I'm gonna shine that place. - You're 16 now. - Ain't that a bitch. - Where are you going? - To school. Leave the keys. Why? Because you can't take the truck. - We'll talk about it later. - How come? We'll talk when you come home from school. That's unfair. Come right back. Can't we talk about it now? No, please. I don't want to start anything. I don't want to have to worry all day... that you're going to pull some big number later. The school called. God, I don't want to talk about this now. I know, Child Development. You've been cutting. It's just Child Development, Mom. It's so stupid, you wouldn't believe it. Can I have the keys, please? I don't want to have a bad day. It's my truck. Dad gave it to me. This is Sam. My daughter Jeanie. Hello. Hi. Jesus, Deirdre, this is gross. I don't know what I'm going to do about this. - We're walking. - Oh, no! God, you know what I hate about this place? When some place is too small, you can never find anything. I should go to New York and live in a loft... become a painter. I need space, like 20-foot ceilings. Let's all go to New York and open a boutique. Yeah. Dad! Dad, please! That guy is sick. What are we going to do? Call the cops? You're lifting the child by the leg! You are not savages! Take the child gently... ever so gently! We show our babies love... and our babies grow up in love. That's a rubber doll, Mrs. Steiner. Excuse me. You want a hit? I'm a mother. All right! Creep. - Don't you want to say hello? - Hello, Scott. Did you miss me? How's Susan? Susan Halpern? You know any other Susans? Her folks invited us to the beach for the weekend. They were there the whole time. And they never took their eyes off of you. Well, yeah... sort of. Hey, Jeanie, like your new hairdo. It's not new, Mr. Simmonds. Will you come to the office? Yeah, sure. Wait a minute. Don't I even get a kiss? You think I want Susan Halpern's bacteria? - They were fighting. - Something racial? - No. A girl. - Thank God. - Do you know where Annie is? - Nope. - No idea? - No. Her dad's looking for her. No... I mean, I don't. I'd like to talk to her first... find out what's going on in her head. Maybe I could smooth things out with her dad. He's... Crazy. Angry. He thinks she should go to a hospital. Where? A private hospital out in Sun Valley. You mean a mental hospital. They work with lots of runaway girls. She doesn't run away anymore. She's been gone for a week. She's been at my house. Ask my mom. I know, honey, but the guy's her dad. He's worried. Know why her sister ran off, Mr. Simmonds? He put handcuffs on her because she got pregnant... and he acts like she's some fallen woman. All she wanted was an abortion. No shit, Mr. Simmonds. Yeah, I know. The guy gets really angry. Yeah. Really, man. How's Annie supposed to become your well-adjusted teenager? If she got right with her dad, she'd really be fucked. For sure. If she got so he thought that she was really A-OK... she'd have to become a policewoman. She should have someplace to go. Where? Well... I don't know. Sometimes I think it's like 1:00 in the morning... and you just had a fight with your mom... and there's no place to go. Someplace with pillows around, a little music... some people to talk to. That sort of thing. Someplace of our own, you know? - Brad! Where you been? - I've been working. Aren't you going to school? No, I got a job filling up fire extinguishers. - Have you seen Annie? - Yeah. - Where? - On the bus. - That bus? - Yeah. Hey, bus! Dumb bus! Dumb fucker bus! You sure you saw her? Yeah. She wanted me to hang with her... but I got to go to work. Did she say where she was going? Hollyweird. You're lying. She's on probation. Hollyweird Boulevard is a bozo no-no. That's what her parole officer said. If you're lying, you're a low character. Excuse me. A major injury accident... a collision on the Golden State Freeway... northbound on the Glendale Freeway... and San Diego Freeway northbound north of Avalon. Bruce Wayne, KFI in... You're Dragon, aren't you? Have you seen Annie? Annie Mallick? You used to know her. God, I don't know how you can talk to that guy. He looks like he could hypnotize you... like a cobra or something. And the next thing, you're out on the Boulevard... dressed like the Pointer Sisters. I knew Annie wouldn't be here. She's not that bananas. I don't know. - Hey, there's Mary! - Who's she? She's in my floral arrangement class. Jeez, what a weirdo. - Mary Weirdo. - The Merry Weirdo. Hey! Annie! There's Annie! - Annie! - Jeanie! Jeanie! It's Jeanie! Come on! Get in the car! I'm walking my dog! On Hollywood Boulevard? I just found him! This is Loser's belt. Just get in the car, OK? Baby, move it, will you? You talking to me? No, creep, you ain't my baby. You don't talk to my woman like that. Just move it, will you, friend? I ain't your friend. You're busting my asshole, asshole. Come on! Get in! Jeanie! You're on probation, you dumb shit. You're supposed to stay out of Hollywood. Loser was taking me home. Stay away from Loser! He's in a street club. I just wanted to get home and see my mom... before my dad gets there. He wants to put you in a hospital. - Ahospital? - For severe maniacs. He can't do that. Oh, he can't? I'm totally freaked. Do you see your dad's car? - Nope. - What about your mom's? She doesn't have a car. OK. Oh, man. We were going to call, Mrs. Mallick. My mom was going to call. Mom wants to know if... Annie can stay at our house for a couple days... if that's OK with you. Just so long as her dad doesn't come along... with a straitjacket or something. If you wouldn't tell him where she is... I'd really appreciate it. I don't tell the man nothing. I can't feel sorry for my mom... not when she takes shit from my dad. Is this what you call barbecue flavor? Hold on. Let's check this out. Here. Gross! You know, he's not really my dad. Since when? - It's true. - No kidding? Remember the flower children that used to do acid? I was eleven. I dropped acid, and it all came out. That guy, the cop, he ain't my dad. I saw my real dad. No shit. - What'd he look like? - Really cool. A cross between Cary Grant and the Mighty Thor. He was a motorcross biker. I don't see Cary Grant on a bike. He was. He was so beautiful. You're crazy. Uh-oh. Hot breath. OK, cool it. Will you just shine him? Is that all you're eating? Would you girls kindly talk to each other? What's wrong with her? What's always wrong with her? Please. Forty-one cents, please. - She's paying for it. - All of this? This OK? That'll be fine. Thank you. Thank you, Greg. - Huh? - Greg. Oh, yeah! Greg. Stick the goodies in the goodie bag. I want to get out alive. Just as long as it's not someplace in the Valley. Someplace in the hills with avocado trees everywhere... a really great sound system... as long as the neighbors don't complain. I don't know what I'd tell my mom. Tell her with all the money she's getting for alimony... She doesn't get alimony since she married Franklin. - She gets child support. - I guess. You're the child, dummy. It belongs to you. What about me? My folks are still together. Maybe they're about to break up. God, Annie, don't say that. Tell her you need a family unit... because you haven't got a family unit right now. No. Franklin isn't exactly a family unit. I don't want you going through this big number for me. What number? Moving out. Finding a place of our own. It's not just for you. My mother would love it. She's always talking about how she's such a young woman. God, my folks, I don't know what they'd say. They never think that I should do anything. Tell them you're spending all your time at my house. They make me feel so juvenile. I hate it. Hello. May I speak with Greg, please? It's an emergency. I'm calling from the hospital. No, but pretty serious. Not really, but pretty. God, I look like shit. I know you don't remember me... but I was in your store today. Huh? Deirdre Thompkins. I bought this little container of yogurt. I was thinking someplace with two windows on either side. That was Mexican lace. One in the morning where I could write. One in the afternoon where I could paint. I'm surprised you remember. Jeanie, do you think we could do that? I don't know. I got to ask my dad. If I tell my mother about the child support... she'll just freak. I have... That is, I had... these two tickets to the Angel concert for tonight... but I lost them, and I thought maybe... I might've dropped them near your cashier stand. You haven't? Oh, drats. I looked through my purse and everything. Let me just look again, OK? Oh, my God. Am I embarrassed. I don't know how to tell you this... but I feel so stupid. I just found them in my purse. I already told my date... he's not my boyfriend, just my date... but I already told him we couldn't go... and he's gone down to the beach... What? Oh, God, Greg. I don't know. I mean, if you'd like... but you hardly know whether you would like me. No, I'm getting there in a car with some dear friends... but I could meet you in the lobby. Hmm? The Shrine Auditorium. About 8:00? Wonderful. What are you telling Bobby, you broke your leg? Hello, Mrs. Koch? Hi. It's Deirdre. Can I talk to Bobby, please? Huh? He left already? Wait a minute. So I went to Elaine's... and then I saw Princess Lee Radziwell, right? And I said, "Hey, Princess Lee... "what are you trying to do, make me sick?" Right on! Hey, you fine thing! You got any tickets you want to sell? Want to buy some 'ludes? Anything you want, baby? Not from you, slime. Dykes! Baby! Kissy kissy! - Yes, yes, yes! - Come on, girls! - Open that, please. - Why? Check your purse. Pull that down, please. Come on. Where you guys been? First set's already on. Let's go. Good evening. We're missing Heavy Waters. Skip says they're dynamite. I see you got your tickets OK. Yeah. Thanks. You don't have to thank me. My dad gets these tickets for free, right? Hi, Scott. How's tricks? - Who's Skip? - Asurfer. What's wrong with that? Shoot the curl, babe. Is she OK? Maybe you better go in and check out the seats. I already did. They're dynamite. Dynamite. You got an attitude, you know? Why don't you just try and be sweet, OK? I'm not going in by myself. - Why not? - Because you're with me. - I mean, you're... - What? You used to be my girl. Jeanie, there's your main man! Here's your guy! - There's Bobby. - Where? OK, Dee, do your stuff. Oops. Hi, Deirdre. Am I late? Who are you? Who is he? Bobby, I got to talk to you. Come on. I got to talk to you. Are you sick or something? Why don't you sit down? Have you ever known me to shit you? Yeah, all the time. This is the one time that I'm not going to. It's Annie. She's really sick. She doesn't look sick. That's because she's not talking to the blond guy. I'm going in. No, look. We tried to distract her mind... so we line her up with this guy... and she takes one look at him, right... she totally freaks. She thinks he looks like her dad. He doesn't look anything like her dad. Sure he does. He's got that whole cop thing going for him. She almost pulled a self-destruct on the spot. Bullshit! You know she's always had this thing for you... Since when? Since... since she was 12 years old. Don't you remember? She always thought that you were all four Beach Boys... rolled into one pair of flippers, you know? You're a lying bitch! And you're Annie's date. What about Deirdre? She's being kind. Yeah? She agreed to sit with Greg. For Annie, huh? Keep it low. Do you want a 'lude? - What's going on? - Hi. Where are you sitting? With Annie. I'm her date. Fuck you guys, huh? What's wrong with him? I don't know. You get your tickets all right? Yeah, thanks. My friends say thanks, too. All right. How's your mom? She's OK. I was hoping... Dad, can I ask you something? Yeah, of course. - Found the bass. - Good. OK. Oh, God. We all go to Seattle tomorrow. Three nights in a football field. Dad... I'm sorry. Go on. Ask. Maybe after the concert, huh? Come on. We'll go in here. Oh, Christ. Here. Are you that unhappy? It's not that, Dad. We want someplace where we can help each other. Why won't it wait until I come back into town? I'm going to be here all through Christmas. We'll see a lot of each other. Anyway, I want you to meet Sandra. - Did you meet Sandra? - No. God, what a cook. Japanese is superb. You'll like her. Just a minute. Give us a minute, please? Getting any rest? You ought to go get a nice little place... for you and Mom in the Valley with some trees around it. I'll pay for it. Mom likes where she is. I'm talking about me. What a bummer. Living in a place like that with all those dead plants. It's not going to take much. Just the child support. I can't mess with that. Those lawyers would roast me, wouldn't they? You need any money for clothes? No. I'm OK. Look... Stick with Mom, eh? Christ, it's bad enough having an absentee dad. I don't mind. I do. Look, I tell you what. At Christmas, let's go back up onto the ranch. Come on. One of these days, I'll buy out Zak and the guys. You and me can own the ranch. We'll get rid of all those crazies up there. Just you and I. And lots of your friends... and we'll get some horses in, plenty of horses. It'd be great, wouldn't it? Yeah. Can I stay with you tonight, Annie? I'm staying at Jeanie's. Can I stay with you? What do you mean? Can I sleep with you? God, Brad, what if I meet someone slick? You really are shitty sometimes. Because I won't sleep with you? We've known each other practically forever. Can I stay with you? Me? I told my dad I wasn't coming home. You want to... Jesus, Brad. It wouldn't be bad. Jeanie? - Duke! There's Duke! - Will you let go? - Honk the horn! - Would you quit it? Annie, what about my party? Whoa! Hey! How you been? - Oh, crap. - Shit. It's all over with Scott? Guess so. You've been together with him for three years. It's too much. Yeah. You know, when I first met him... I was so much in love with him... that every time I saw him, I'd cry. He couldn't figure it out. "Hi," he'd say, and I'd just blubber. It's really weird. I bought this necklace... this bracelet for him in Laguna. I never had the guts to give it to him. Then finally, when we got together... I never gave it to him... because it reminded me so much of him... I didn't want to let it go. He sure has changed since he got the van. Changed since he got the hairblower. I guess you don't feel much like my party, huh? Yeah, why not? There's a lot of other guys. Like who, for instance? Lots. Lots of egos. No. Out of control egos. You know about guys. What's that supposed to mean? You've slept with guys. A lot. I slept with a couple of guys... in ninth grade because it was new... but I'm not some total dingbat like Deirdre. OK. I'm no Suzy Slut, you know what I mean? Yeah. I slept with a guy once. - What? - We didn't do anything. We just slept. He held me so tight... my nose was pressed against his neck... I thought I was going to suffocate. Who is this guy, the Boston Strangler? You don't know him. He's a much older guy. You been sticking your nose in somebody's neck... and I don't know him? We used to be friends. Come on. Hey, sis. What are you guys doing here? Mother! What are these guys doing here? God, what a crybaby. I'm going to get furious with you. "I'm going to get furious with you." Sissie, put 'em up. OK, kids! In the kitchen, quick! Scoot! Hi, Jeanie. - Hi, Mrs. Axman. - What's the fuss? I don't want a bunch of kids at my party. Your friends aren't kids anymore, huh? Mom, I don't expect you to understand. Come on. You and I know that is malarkey, Miss Smart. - Turn that off, will you? - Sure. We'd just as well sit down and talk out the ground rules... before your friends get here. I don't want a lecture now. - I didn't say lecture. - In front of Jeanie? You want a beer? There's a keg in the kitchen. No, thanks. Let's all sit down. Mom, I'm trying to get my head into having a good time. If you're going to spoil it... Come on and laugh a little, for damns sake! Dad and I got the keg of beer... which I still can't believe, but damned if we didn't. When the party gets started, we'll go on to bed. You'll have the house. What if I told you some people don't drink beer? They drink other stuff. What people? Your high school friends? They drink scotch and tequila and stuff like that. You drink scotch, Madge? No, but I could if I wanted. I could drink it for breakfast. You drink scotch, Jeanie? No. I don't like scotch. They're bringing scotch tonight? Maybe. I don't tell them what to bring. I'm not their mother. Well, well. Going to be some party. Maybe Dad and I should go out of town tonight. That way everybody wouldn't have a mother around. You'll make it impossible! Everybody could get real drunk on scotch... and have a free time. A real sexual time, maybe. - Did you call me? - No! Go to the kitchen, Sissie. - I want to hear! - Go! It's so unreal. Why do they always talk about sex? It's not me, it's you. Your friends, they're all talking about it. They're having affairs in junior high school. You don't think that we can have any serious emotion? That any of us can experience something really deep? Jeanie's been in love since she was twelve. I bet you don't even believe it. I don't want you to think I was born on another planet. When Dad and I were going together... we experimented. More than once. I can't lie to you. Mom, you don't have to get into this. But I always wished that we hadn't, that we waited. You don't understand. I have. I've waited. What do you mean? - I'm a virgin. - What's wrong with that? - I hate it. - Thank God! Sissie, bring your mother a beer! Come on, Mom. What are we gonna do with her? We're not gonna have a party. We sure as shootin' are! Madge says we're not. If you don't come out and say hi to your friends... I'm sending them away. If I send them all away... you'll have to call everyone and apologize. And until you do... You are making me furious! Until you make an apology on the phone... to every one of your friends who comes by here tonight... you are grounded! You can bank on it! I think Angel's real cute, you know? That punk movement... they're a bunch of retards... with safety pins in their faces. Gotta go home. The party's off. Where's Madge? - She's grounded. - How come? She's a virgin. Hi. - How was the concert? - Fine. I saw Dad. How is he? Fine. What's wrong, Mom? I just read this friggin' page five times. How come you're not asleep? Because I have a test tomorrow... and I study for my tests. Your dad thinks that if I get a degree... that I'll be smart enough to leave him alone. Did you do your homework? I don't have any. It's the weekend. I got this crazy idea that you'll go to college... read a lot of books, and become this brainy person. You'll know how to talk to neurotics like your mother. How's your friend? Sam? He seems nice. He's with his wife. Ex-wife. He's divorced. Hey, that's cool. He's taking me to lunch tomorrow. Did he take you to dinner last night? - What does that mean? - Nothing. Forget it. I'm a 40-year-old woman... and I'm sitting here reading Plato again. It's insane! No, he didn't take me to dinner last night. And he didn't take me to dinner tonight... because his ex-wife called, and he wasn't free to go. So he apologized. What for? Sure, I should have had dinner with him first... and found out if his intentions were honorable or not. I was too busy throwing myself at some guy... like all the other divorced, desperate UCLA undergraduates. But I did it because it felt good... because I wanted to, OK? OK. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I can't focus again. You gotta get your prescription checked. I know. I keep meaning to. Right there. I would've loved Plato. He and his friends... none of them liked to wear shoes. "Thus far, I've been speaking... "of the fourth and last kind of madness... "which is imputed to him who... "when he sees the beauty of the earth... "is transported with the recollection..." ...the manager of the Shoe Stop shoe store... on Hacienda Boulevard in La Puente. Good morning. Shoe Stop. May I help you? I have a hobby. I like to chew on shoes. It's something I do at home, but I'm... - You like to what? - Chew on shoes. Today is my day off. I wondered whether I could come down to Shoe Stop... and just chew on some of the shoes there for a while. Get out of here, or I'll personally kill you. - I'm not gonna wear them. - Is it noticeable? If another customer comes in and wants that shoe... is it going to be noticeable that somebody nibbled on it? Are your shoes that quality that somebody's going care? We don't carry junk here. You do have terrific prices down there... because it is self-service? The shoes would sell elsewhere for $20 or $16.90? That's correct. I'm at a pay phone right around the corner. Why don't you just let me come over? This is incredible. Why don't you come over now? I have some shoes in the back. We'll talk about it. If somebody's going to eat shoes... they might as well eat the best, right? Jay, you're leaving? Just to New York for a week. I've been calling your place for weeks. I couldn't call back. Why? I was dying. Mom thinks I'm going with Terry. She likes him because he smiles a lot. It's obnoxious. What's wrong with me? You know. The age thing. For a change. - I'm sixteen. - Doesn't matter. My grandmother was having babies at sixteen. Sheila had a baby at sixteen. My grandmother was married. She didn't want to marry the guy. OK. Don't get mad. I want to ask you a question. Do you really love me? That's the question? No, I'm getting to that. But I want to know that first. I'm in love with you. You know what that means? It means you throw up a lot. No, seriously. Every time I listen to the radio... every song I hear is about you. I've been sick a lot. What's the question? I know we didn't actually do anything that night... because you have this tremendous amount... of respect for me. I appreciate it. Like you say, you don't want to rush into anything... not when you feel so deeply about somebody, but... Yeah? What would have been so wrong with it? What? If we made love... would it have been so terrible? Well, no. What time does your plane leave? They got planes going all day to New York. Hello? Jeanie? Hi. I've been a terrible friend to you. I've been keeping a secret from you. It's the most important secret in my life. I feel terrible. I'm in love. A guy named Jay. You don't know know him. He's much older. Yeah. Guess what? I'm in his bed now. Yeah. Madge... did you cry? What the hell. Maybe I will. He says why don't I spend all my time here? When he's out of town, everybody can stay here. Yeah. Annie, too. Annie's cool. Yeah. He wants to meet you, too. I'll talk to you later, OK? OK. Yeah, OK. Bye. - That was Madge. - I heard. Things like that can really make you sad, you know? Yeah. The day your best friend gets devirginized. No, it's not that. She's the type of girl... that goes to bed with a guy once and marries him. Come on. A girl gets married at sixteen, she'd have to be real ugly. We'll probably never see her again. I'm not getting married until I'm 26. Maybe I'll have a baby... and then decide if I really need the guy. But not before I'm 26. What are you going to do up until then? Just what I'm doing now. Have a good time. Good time. This is making me sick. I hope Jay doesn't mind us using all his logs. He won't mind. Wait a minute. Shit. We gonna have a fire again? We're trying. Isn't it awful hot? Didn't you like the fire we had last night? Yeah. It was like Campfire Girls. A lot of the old songs. When you got a home, you gotta have a hearth. OK. Here we go. God! Look at this! Look what you did to my floor! That's Jay's floor. We better get a vacuum and clean this shit up. Help! Yellow Zonkers. Fiddle Faddle. Twinkies? Lays? Look at this. Wheat Thins? I'm on a diet. - What's this? - Malt liquor. This is supposed to be dinner, not a football game. Go yourself next time! You're the only one with an ID. - Where's the cream cheese? - I ran out of money. Thirteen bucks and no dip? I don't believe you! - God, what a gimp. - No dip? Fuck you all, OK? I'm the only who has to go to the store all the time... and buy that stuff. My mom doesn't even know where I am. She sounded really worried on the phone. Come on, Dee. I don't even know what we're doing here. This is a place of our own. A family, sort of. Wait right here. Maybe I should go home for a little while. Dee, forget your mom. When you go out in the world, it gets scary sometimes. Learn to laugh a little. Yeah. Why don't we ever have a party? A party without Jay? Forget it. I'm sorry. I'll be right back. Hey! This is stoked. Jeanie? How about a little something for those glasses? - Shit! - Annie! Terry? Carter, here you go. Greg? Thanks. Greg? Need anything from the kitchen? Just you, Deirdre. I think this occasion calls for a toast. Great. Carter has this tremendous speaking voice. Shit! I'll get it. I got it! I'll get it! Are you gonna be gross at our party? Told you we shouldn't invite him. I wanted a real date. I'm a real date. You're a nerd. You piss me off sometimes. Why don't you just grow up? Get taller or something. Brad, you're tall enough to eat dinner. Why don't you dry up? Go get some coffee. It's OK. I'm sorry. Rejection. Hey, is this stoked? Yeah, really stoked. Why don't you sit over there? - All right. - Nice! Everyone start. I'll be back. Is Laurie here? No, Debbie. This is a private party. Laurie told me to meet her here. I'm gonna get pissed. I don't know how Laurie knows about this party. Well, excuse me! Can I at least come in and wait for her? - No. - God! Good night. I looked over at the table, and it was her. Joni Mitchell, man! I could not believe it. She looked terrific. I put my hand on Corky's hand, and I go... "Hey, it's Joni Mitchell!" And he goes, "Oh, yeah." Just like it was his mother or something. Joni Mitchell. Wow! I was, like, freaking out. I couldn't believe it. Joni Mitchell! Whoa, man! Anybody hear the new album by Weather Report? I smiled at her. She smiled back at me! No shit, man! I thought that was so hip. Joni Mitchell smiled at me! OK, Annie, OK. I mean, no shit! Just calm down. My turn. At least she wasn't some stuck-up twat. - Scarlett! - Jason. Scarlett, it's Rhett. Let me in. Very funny. On good looks alone, I deserve more than that. Why don't you take your good looks down the hill? - Jason! Jason! - Hey, princess! You still go to Hollywood High? I go to Pierce College now. I'm a psych major. Come on in and have some champagne. This is a private party, OK? You guys know Buddy, don't you? Hey, Buddy! You want some champagne? - Come on in, Buddy. - Banzai! Hey! Come on, Jeanie. Dinner's over. This isn't even our place. - Let's ask Madge. - Stay there. - I'm with Buddy. - Oh, Christ! There's a lot of guys out there. Come on outside. I'd like to show you something. No, thanks. I've seen it. Now, listen, if you're going with a guy... you can use a diaphragm... because you got an idea when you're doing it. But, on your own, better stick to the pill... because you never know what you don't know, you know? No! They can't stay. You can't stay. I'm sorry. It's OK. Don't be sorry. This is a private party. I'm just leaving. You ready to go, darlin'? Yeah, he's ready to go. Dang you! What's going on? Get off the line! You bastard. Get off the line! I'm trying to call the police! You fucker! Any injuries? Some items are hot. Stereo equipment mostly, but nobody wants to remember... who stole them or where they went. Yes, they're right here, the responsible party. No. We wanted to hold them until we told you. No, sir. It's your place. In that case, we'll hold them for their parents... and give them a counsel and release. Again? Mad? Mad axe man? Give me a spelling on that. "Madge... Axman." Thank you. He wanted a Madge Axman to know... he'd be returning to the city in the morning. Hello, Frank. - Working hard? - No. What do we got here? Drunkenness, narcotics, destruction of property. Some stolen goods... but the owner doesn't want to press charges. I'm giving them all a counsel and release. Is that your daughter? Bye, Annie. Stay there. Drunkenness? Narcotics? Destruction of property? What else? They're cops, Mom. I don't like your friends. I know that. You'll have to tell me. Are there any nice people left in the world? You never like my friends. Are there nice boys, nice girls? Either one? - Yeah. - What? Yeah! I said yeah! Whatever happened to the word "yes"? For Christ sake, they're putting Annie in the hospital! You don't even care! I do care, and I'm sorry, darling. I know Annie's basically a nice kid... You don't even know her. I know you're upset. She could die in that hospital. She could end up committing suicide. Did she say something about suicide? She can't stand small spaces. Did she actually say the word "suicide"? No, but I know what she feels. I'll call the hospital. Oh, God. That's not gonna do any good. We'll ask the doctors what their opinion is. They're the ones that are saying Annie's sick... and their opinions are just sick. They're doctors. We can ask their opinion. - Just forget it. - What? Stop telling me to say things over again. It really bothers me. It's a very rude thing to say to somebody. Oh, God! You keep wanting me to cry! I don't want to cry anymore! Maybe Annie is sick. Did you ever think of that? Maybe the whole bunch of you is sick. You booze, you dope, you sleep with whoever. I don't even know who you are. You look like kids, but you don't act like them. You're short 40-year-olds, and you're tough ones. You just hate everybody since Dad left. Everyone except some guy you can just meet and... What? Meet and what? You throw yourself on the line all the time, Mom. You jump on some guy, and when he tells you... he doesn't want to see you, you cry on the phone. I don't care if you are my daughter. You're not talking about me or my friends... You talk about my friends that way! And you don't like Sam? I don't know him! Do you? Do you know him, Mom? Did you know him before you jumped into bed with him? That's nasty. That's cruel and nasty and ugly and unloving! I wish I could punch you! I wish to God I knew how to punch you! What's the matter with Sam? He wears white shoes. White shoes? You apologize! I haven't finished. I'm not finished! Just because they fit you for a diaphragm... doesn't make you a woman! Sam is a good man... and you make no mistake about that. He's a decent human being, and he cares for me. He says he even loves me. I'm going to spend some time with him. A week, a few days. Who knows? You want a place of your own? Fine. Take this one. I won't bring him here anymore. All you girls are laughing at him. There's too much music here. Too many boys, girls laying all over the furniture... half out of your clothes on the floor. You're too beautiful, all of you. You make me hate my hips. I hate my hips. I thought it was Jay. It's just me. Oh, Jeanie. Where's Deirdre? Her mom won't let her come. Stay away from trouble. Something like that. Well, shit on her. She's not going with us to see Annie? No one is. I talked to her mom. You talked to Gladys? Yeah. She says no one can visit her unless... they're family. Her dad doesn't want her to see us anyway. He's such a total drag. Time to scream, you know. It's not her fault. Gladys is a nice lady once you get past her depressions. What are we gonna do? It's awful, huh? It's not good. We'll get jobs and pay for the stereo. I'm taking the proficiency exam so I won't have classes... and I can work full-time. They'll give me a certificate that I can show... Will you excuse us, please? I can get into some colleges. Some colleges I can get into. We're paying for everything. Doing what? Do you have any idea what it's going to cost... to put this place back together again? Yes. Oh, yeah? How much? You think we're children, don't you? I know you're children! Living off your parents, for Christ's sake. I thought you loved me. I thought age didn't matter. But I do love you. I fucking worship you. I must be nuts. God, I must be nuts. I'll leave. Terrific. You can stop breaking things. It'll just cost us more. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? Be a waitress at Denny's? Maybe! At that rate, it would take you 80 years apiece! I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Jay Thompson. The next time you see any of us children... coming through that door... I'll have the money in my hand! What door? This door! I'm really pissed at you... and all your flaky teenage friends. I'm not through talking to you. I am. - Come back here. - So you can beat me up? You're goddamn right. Forget it. Please? What? What do you mean what? Please what? Please come back here so I can beat you up! I thought they had you filling fire extinguishers. - Christmas is coming. - Shit. - Are you breaking for lunch? - No way. I thought maybe you'd want to have some lunch. All right. Will they let you do that? Are you kidding me? This guy's paying shit. You've got some white stuff in your hair. I thought you might be sad about Annie... need someone to talk to. I remember how incredibly sad you can get about things... and you shouldn't have to go through all that alone. Thanks. You smell something? It's my boots. What have you been walking in? I ran out of socks... and that makes my feet sweat a lot. God, that's awful. You should get some socks. Those boots are awful. You didn't have to do that. The trouble with L.A. is that everybody tries to act... so supercool and into their own space. Like they'd be ruined if they had to feel anything. I used to be in yoga class. God, this stuff is poison. You don't know what they put in here. What are you gonna do, right? Nobody wants to feel the pain in things anymore. For instance, I can feel the pain in things sometimes. There's this one-eyed rooster I know... some dog got to him and bit a hole in his head... back in this place where my dad used to take me... when he was into the outdoors. Some ranch in the Sierras. A bunch of stoner types, real spiritual heads... always in some full lotus... squatting their way to a new head or something... which is really bullshit... because they're all rock 'n' rollers... making lots of real heavy money... and they're om-ing up in the hills. I said, "There's pain in this rooster's head." And they go, "Too much maya, man." Like pain's an illusion... like it isn't even real. Christ, illusion, right? I wanted to laugh. It was like some church for these guys... sitting under these trees. I did something gross. My dad got so pissed. I let this guy's tea... accidentally, right... this whole cup of hot tea fall down this guy's leg. He's sitting there, screaming and yelling. He said he wasn't mad at me... but it was a really stupid bitch thing to do. Boy... he stopped talking about pain being an illusion. What are you thinking about? About Annie. What about Annie? Just about Annie. I guess it's too late to go back to work. It's no problem. Sorry. Was there angel dust in those joints? No. You sure you're not lying? - Would I lie to you? - Yeah. I just... I can't handle it. Angel dust, I mean. Is that your phone ringing? Forget it. Yeah. Hello? Annie, how are you? Will they let you phone from there? Brad's here. I'll let you talk to him. What? Wait a minute. Where are you? You're where? Annie! Annie! Let's go. That's Annie. - How is she? - She's loaded. Jesus. Come on, baby. You ready to leave? - We're having a party. - Doctor says no more parties. - Get me home. - OK. Excuse me. - What did he say? - Excuse me. Why? What did he do? Jimmy, what is this pile of shit? Shootout. - Your neck's bleeding! - My neck! I was so pissed, I just walked out... right in the middle of visitor's hour... with this girl's parents, like I was her sister. They gave me prescription dope at the hospital. What a trip, man. Remember that? Jack Nicholson... What a trip, man. Can we sit down? No. Look, could you walk off these pills? Otherwise, you'll end up going into a coma. Was I happy to see you. You were beautiful. - You lie. - You were my hero. I saw you coming, and I said... "Hero, take me home." You did not. I was thinking it. - Yeah? - You should've called. I did! I called forever. I thought you'd be happy to see me. - You got a 'lude? - No, he doesn't. You gonna be a total drag? I just shined one mother. I don't need another. So you got a couple of low characters for parents... and you think they can just fuck all. I can understand that. But if you're gonna get loaded all the time... and shine everybody, well, shine you. It's not working anymore. Shine you if that's how you feel. I'm going to Oregon. - Oregon! - Bert's up there. - Another dirt head. - He's measuring trees. I'm living alone now. My mom moved out. I don't know what the hell she's doing with her life... but that's her business. I'm willing to take you on for a couple weeks... but not if you're gonna get loaded all the time. You understand? I'm going to Oregon. You can't even walk with one foot in front of the other! Come on now, Annie! Annie! Annie! Annie! Listen to me! I'm getting real pissed. Stop! Listen to me, god damn it! If you're gonna stay with me, you go by the rules! The rules are we get through this fucking high school! We're gonna pay back Jay and get jobs! And if you don't like it, that's tough shit! That's the way life is... and you better learn to eat a little! I'm not coming back for you every time you goddamn blow it! You know... no one can take a joke anymore. It's my dad! It's a patrol car, Annie. Annie! Stay there. Don't go far, OK? - I want some I.D. - What for? You're after curfew, this is a private road... and because I want it. You, too. You're going home. We don't want to see you up here again. We've got your names. Annie! Annie, where are you? Was that my dad? They're gone, Annie. Where are you? - Here. - Where? Here. Where the fuck is she? Hey, turkey, here! Come on! Oh, shit! Get the guy! Try and get him! Let him drive! She thinks I'm putting her on the spot if I call her. Like it's really stupid if I love her. She keeps on saying, "You must be high." Isn't that the rat's ass? High? Just because I love her? "That's the rules," she said. I can't come over or see her if I'm high. Oh, man. I just love her. That's not high, huh? No. I've been in my car for three days now. For real? Well, I stop to eat. God, you're really bent up. You girls think it's a joke or something... being in love. Are you sure we're going to North Hollywood? Well, actually, I was going to Santa Monica... but I thought you might want to go with me. Thanks, man, but I got to get to North Hollywood. I'm not like those guys that are disrespectful to girls. You better let me out. OK. Thanks a lot, really. Here. You want a pill? Jeanie, be there. Disappointed? I know you wanted a place of your own. It's OK, Mom. We sort of had one. Sam wants me. It's not that. He'd like me to stay. What happened? I couldn't move my robe in there. The place was too nice for my robe. Annie left the hospital. We don't know where she is. She'll be back. I don't know. You want a ride? Are you going to North Hollywood? Are we going to North Hollywood? Yeah. Let's go to North Hollywood. You sure you're going that way? Sure. Hi. I'm Daryl. This is my wife... Bert. Oh, yeah? You think that's a strange name? It's strange. Here. Hold this. Watch your driving. Grab onto that. Here. Grab the wheel. You guys are weird. Did you hear that? Why are you so uptight? We like you. Why don't you relax? I gotta get to Jeanie's. Who's she? Come on. Relax. The Beast with Five Fingers. Want to turn up the IVs? Don't... Those are Jeanie's pants. - No. It's OK. - Pressure's dropped. Pressure's dropped, huh? She's going out of it here. - Turn up the IV. - All right. Take it easy. It'll be OK. Slow that down a bit. That's good. That's good. She's spitting up blood. We've lost her. We gotta wake up Annie. You sure piss me off sometimes, Annie. I can't go on without you all! How does it feel, married woman? - I'm terrified! - You hear that? - Buh-bye! - Good-bye, everybody. Bye! Dad! Here we go! I'll come out later, OK? Where are you going? We're going to Stan's. Some real heavy family stuff. Otherwise, I'd go with you now, really. - OK. - Bye, Mary. Bye. You want me to drive up there with you? If you want. I don't want to tell you that you can't. Tell me the truth. My God, you're on your way to college. You'll be on your own. The least we can do is be honest at this point. I don't know. Things get so complicated. We'd be better off... if we didn't call each other mother and daughter. I'd rather go alone. That's the truth. I like calling you Mom. OK? I know the subject doesn't come up too often. We never really get the chance to talk about it... but I really love you. I love you, too, darling. Back in the heavy stone days... when we used to stay up and talk a lot, Annie and me... we were talking about dying, how it feels and all. I said I'd never get buried. I couldn't stand them shoveling dirt in my face. I'd know I'd be dead, but I still might have... this strong compulsion to breathe, OK? But Annie, she said she wanted to be buried... right in the ground under a pear tree. Really. Not in a box or anything. She said she wanted the roots going right through her... and each year, we'd come along, take a pear and go... "Hey, Annie's tasting good this year, huh?"
