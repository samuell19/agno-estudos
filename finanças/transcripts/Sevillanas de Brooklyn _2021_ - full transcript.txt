Mum says that large families only have to pay half. And asks if I can have a Cola Cao. - Who else wants one? - Me! Tell Juan to get them ready. Juan! Cola Cao! WHEN BROOKLYN MET SEVILLE There goes our student! Yeah! The smartest girl around. Check this out, Brayan. At least say hi to us. Hi. Fucking hell, Ana! Stop running, I'm dying here. Can you pay? I'm super broke. As long as your Auxi's on the dole, your bottle of beer is guaranteed. I've got a job interview tomorrow. If I get it, I'll drop out of uni. Does Carmen know? I'll have 125g of turkey. It's for my Ana, she's starving when she gets back from uni. My Ana's studying, you know? Carmen, the cheap one or the dear one? Why's the dear one more dear? Because it doesn't have any phosphates. I'll have the one with phosphates, they're good for the memory. She is studying, after all... If you want get a job... Listen, Antoñito, this goes for you. Go about your life as if you don't need one. Your watch, freshly ironed shirt, packet of Winston... I don't smoke, Dad. - It's all about attitude. - Soup. When your daughter gets here, sweetie. I'm home. Already at the table? I got a bit behind today. You'll never guess who I saw in the shop. What's going on? Why are you all so quiet? I've got a job interview tomorrow and I'm not going to university. This old nonsense again. Know who I saw in the shop? Rosaura, with the headscarf. Mum, listen. She's got three grandsons. Can you believe it? - Mum. - Her eldest has two, her ugly girl, one. I'm dropping out of uni and getting a job! Get it? What kind of job? At the checkout? In the Chinese shop? Cleaning for 400 euros a month? Come on now... I'd sooner sell myself on the streets. - Those exams have really got to her. - Soup. Yes, sweetie. It's for... Granny. I'll take you out later. Love you, sweetie. Antonio. This is for bread, this is for milk and this is for you. I have to go somewhere first. I'm off, Mum. Bye. - Party? - Yes, to a party. And our little girl? She left already. And the rent, Carmen? Yes, yes, I know. Give me a week, Paco. Carmen, it's been three months. One more week. HIGH FASHION FUR SHOP Do you know what we do here? You sell fur coats. Not exactly. Do you know how many times you can wear a fur coat in Seville? Zero point seventeen days per year. Our clients don't buy fur coats to protect themselves from the cold. They buy them because they can. They need to know that they have a beautiful, useless, terribly expensive fur coat in their closet. Ranking, status, power, position. That's what we sell here. Can you even imagine who our clients are? Arseholes. - Mum? - You scared me! What are you doing here? - No. - Mum, open the door, Mum! - Hello? - Post, can you open the door? - Why are you dressed like that? - I'm meeting a man. A man? No, Mum. Don't close the door. Mum. What are you up to? Open the door. Mum! Mum! Mum, open the door, damn it. Mum! - What? - I won't let you sell yourself. Sell myself? Get in here. You've really made my day, my girl. I'm meeting a man from an agency for American students. We'll say that this is our home. What? Mum, have you lost your mind? I'm called Elena and so are you. - Yes? - Elena Morgades? - Y Cifuentes. - Y Cifuentes, of course. Jesus Martinez, we spoke on the phone. You couldn't find a better location. This must be little Elenita. Don't mind her, it's a difficult age. All they think about is horse riding and golf. I love golf. What's your handicap? Handicap? None. One leg a bit longer than the other. Half a centimetre, hardly noticeable. That's a good one! Why don't you show me the house? This is quite a place. This is the sitting room, American style. It's lovely. We're going to put a Pinball machine there. Need I say more? This is the kitchen. And this will be the girl's room. What do you think? - Unbelievable. - Absolutely. - Do you have a copy of your tax returns? - Here you go. Well, to tell you the truth... I... I think it's a yes. I'll talk to the director and, if everything's in order, she'll be here in less than a month. - Thank you, that's very kind. - A pleasure. Very kind. Cheer up, it's 700 euros a month. You're crazy. You think they won't catch you? Catch you at the club. Such a difficult age... Sorry for your loss. I didn't know you were so close. Close? I didn't give a damn about him. The guy that died was Ariel's host father, who's coming today. Know how much each day without a host family will cost us, what with hotels and meals? 530 dollars. We need to find a host family right away. I think I've got one. - How's it going? Cigarette break? - Great. Here, this is for you. How did it go yesterday? Incredible. She'll be here in a month. By the way, the house is spotless. You could eat off that floor. - I clean like my life depends on it. - Yes. Don't worry about the owners. They're in Sotogrande all year. That's great. This stuff's fine, but it doesn't pack the same punch as tobacco... - My Eulogio gave it to me. - He's mad for you. Because of my curves. Now I think of it. This is for you. Give the boss' tax returns back to Eulogio. - And tell him thank you. - He told me this is a crime. Your Eulogio is such an optimist but I don't want him to go to prison because of me. Don't worry, I don't like him that much anyway. It's your phone. Hello? When? This afternoon? And what time? Want some, Granny? It isn't hash, it's weed. It's good for her. No, she doesn't need it. She's already tripping out, see? Granny, sweetie. - Hi, Mum. - Sweetie. What? When? Tonight? Mum... Mum, listen to me, please. Tell them no. My room? No, Mum. I don't have time. Mum... - They bought it, she's coming today. - Right on! That's 700 bucks for Carmen, for Anita and for Bolito. Come on, Granny. Abraham! I'll help you. Abraham! Bolo, look after this. My dad'll smoke it all. Let's get Granny up. Almost there, Granny. - Careful. - I'm stuck! Careful. I've come straight from surgery. Anything serious? "Hammerhoids". A delicate matter. We've had quite a day, too... But I said: "Don't worry, I have a solution". And I called you. Of course. You did well. The director almost kissed me. I'm on trial, you see. It's my first job. Your first job? My first job. I'm sure they'll take me. Don't you think? By the way, we've paid the 700 euros into your account. I'm trying really hard. Oh, Ariel, like the little mermaid. I can see her now. Mine's such a beautiful girl! Where's the Black guy going? Good evening. - Ariel? - Yes. Welcome. This is Elena. Your mother. She's a surgeon. Mum. She was expecting a girl. But it's a boy and he's home. Pleased to meet you. I'll leave you to it. The taxi is paid for. Any problems, just give me a call. Anything, I've trained for this. You're in good hands. I'll see you tomorrow at the family reception, OK? OK. Bye! Mum. We're here. - It's paid for, right? - Yes. - Don't forget anything. - I won't, don't you worry. You live here? Look, my mother lives here, she's elderly, an old woman, a senior citizen, understand? Retired, widowed, but a real sweetie. Listen, if we speak too quickly, because the Spanish speak really quickly, and you don't understand, tell us. Go ahead, mi Arma, it's open. And we'll speak slower. You say: "I don't understand. Speak slower". And we'll speak slower. What have you got in here? It weighs a ton. Jeez, you're tall. And the lift? There isn't one, but don't worry, it only takes a second. Come on. What on earth's in here? - Lots of things. - So I see. It's unbelievable! This is it. Come on in. Give me that, love, I'll put it in here. Come on. Put that there, there in the corner. That's right. Here we are. Surprise! Shit, he's Black. That's what I said when I saw him. We thought it was a girl, and look. Let me introduce you, Ariel. This is Granny Mercedes. Whose boy are you? You don't know his mother, Mum. Antonio, my husband. Hello. Just so you know, I've always been against slavery. Why bring up slavery, Antonio? Come on. This is Auxi, a friend of the family. You're not from Wisconsin, are you? Don't start, Auxi. This is little Antoñito, my son. Quit calling me little Antoñito. I'm Bolo and I'm a rapper, like you. I'm not a rapper. You're Black. - You can be Black and not be... - Gutted. Get the door. This is Brayan, - I don't know why he's here. - Watch out for me. Good evening. Carmen, I'm not having a sub-Saharan in my flat. Paco. Let's get this straight. Racism has no place here. Paco, he's an American student. I'll tell you tomorrow, OK? Just what you need. Another mouth to feed! The opposite, he's paying. Don't you worry. Where were we? Oh, yes. And this is Ana, my daughter. She's studying. Isn't she pretty? - Hello. - Hello. Welcome and all that. Thanks. I don't know if you'd noticed, but... I'm Black. Yeah, the thing is... You caught us a little by surprise. Let me show you your room, you must be dying to see it. This way. I used to sleep here with my sister. Isn't it cool? I had a poster of Sofia Vergara in a bikini, but they took it off me. Would you mind if I took a video of you? For my mum, so that she can meet you. Of course. That'll put her mind at ease. Go ahead. Sorry, what was your name? Antonio Galíndez, at your service, Ma'am. And God's service and whoever else needs me. Sending you lots of kisses, Ariel's mum, sweetie. Don't film me. Go on, Ana, translate. She's studying English philology. What did he say? He said some lovely things about us, didn't you? It's as if he's known us his whole life. Pretty, so pretty. Was that you singing? Blues? Yes. - I'm showering Granny. - I need the bathroom, urgently. Will you be long? Twenty little minutes. Granny shat herself. Do you understand "cagar”? It's the first thing we learn. Shit, piss, bitch, fuck. Well, fuck you, then. Good evening. Hey. I don't speak Arabic, just English and Spanish. I'm American. Get out! Brayan! Put your helmet on! - What are you doing? - Training. Get on, quickly. Shit. - Fuck. - What happened, Black dude? They're all crazy. Bolo had drugs in his pockets. Those are Bolo's trousers? - Where are the drugs, Black dude? - I dumped them. You dumped the drugs? Where did you dump them, fucking Black dude? I don't know. And don't call me "Black dude”. "Don't call me 'Black dude'?" You don't know the meaning of Black. I've never raised a hand to any of my kids and you're getting a slap on the very first night. We'll talk tomorrow. Look, Jesus, I mean... So, this is your real house. And this is your real family. - And you're not a surgeon. - Well, I work at a hospital, as a cleaner. And you're not Elena, but Carmen. Well, Carmen... you pulled a fast one on me. I'm sorry, love. I know how hard you've worked to get this job. Sorry to you too, Ariel. We're all sorry. Speak for yourself. - All of us! - All of us, all of us. We'll give the 700 euros back. - Don't get ahead of yourself. - End of story. I hope that this puts an end to this business and that, at least, Jesus can keep his job. That's out of our hands. I have to talk to the agency. You conned me. Look, Ariel, I understand that you're angry. And you didn't deserve that slap in the face yesterday. But nobody conned you here. I wouldn't have done any of this if I wasn't convinced that I could give you the best home in the world. He's gobsmacked, basically... Ariel, give me three days, I'll find you another home. A better one. But don't tell on me, please. Three days. The best home in the world. Can you look after him? Like one of my own. And, Jesus, just to be clear, what about the 700... 72. Enough, Antonio. Jesus! Madam Director! Let me introduce you to Ariel. Nice to meet you. I understand you're with a wonderful family. Yeah... I'm... gobsmacked? Great. I can't wait to meet them. Unfortunately, only the daughter could come. The most normal one. "The most normal one"? You know what people of that class are like, they're a little extravagant. I see. You look normal dressed like that. So do you, without the cops on your heels. It's a shame your parents couldn't come. I would have liked everybody to meet my family, but I think it would give Jesus a heart attack... Are you going to give me a Coca-Cola or keep up this bullshit? Let me introduce you, little sister. Little... You wish. Carmen, slow down, I can hardly breathe. You know I don't like being late. Didn't Jesus say to just send Ana? Ariel can't be by himself on a day like this. You don't have to come. Then they'll think he's from a broken family! Carmen! Carmen! Wait. - This floozy? - She's got no shame. Where are you going? - Ana can't go alone. - What's that stench? It's by Shakira, from the Chinese shop. Isn't it divine? Get off! Let's go, then! It stinks, yuck. It's disgusting. "Which fucking rat snitched on us? I'm taking that motherfucker down. Silver or lead". - What's Granny doing here? - She wanted to come, didn't you, Gran? Party, party. - I've got her pills. - Her pills... Come on, let's go. Hello, hello. Hey, how's it going? How are you? Is that the family? I... I can explain. I'm delighted, too. How exotic. Introduce them to me after my speech. I think we're a great success. Hey, are any of you from Wisconsin? Good afternoon, my dear students and host families. I'll be brief. When I go to the USA to present our project, I always say they're leaving their children in the best hands. With the best families in the whole of Seville. Thanks to you, our students are not only improving their Spanish, but also being impregnated with the culture and idiosyncrasy of this city. These experiences will stay in their hearts forever. That's why, every year, we don't reward the best Spanish student, but the one who integrates most with the city. And this year we'll decide with... a Sevillanas dance competition. - Olé! - How lovely! Anal. Let the party continue! I'm in love with American culture. Really”? You don't say. Yes, yes, look. The eagle on this Winston, pure American, from Rota. That says it all. I'll have a glass of red. We put Clarice in the guest home in the chalet. The first night the poor girl came in crying because she wanted to live with us. Excuse me, are you from Wisconsin? No way, I'm from Utrera. I'm one of the hosts. From Utrera. You looked a little like you might be from... Wisconsin. Got some? Are you selling? You know... My cap? Come on, man. We've got pills. Twelve for 50 bucks. - Just for you. - Are they good? Good? They'll knock your fucking socks off. The first thing our Matthew did was go to the riding school. And when they saw him ride, they signed him up for the polo team. Our first match is next Saturday. Well, my Ariel, last night, he ate 16 meatballs, huge ones like this. Hi, I'm Cameron. "De la Isla"? [No, no. I'm from Wisconsin. ] Nice to meet you, I'm Auxi. Auxi? Liadora. Maria Auxiliadora. What? That's right. You make a stir-fry, with a lot of onion. Two cloves of garlic, salt, pepper. Some... My chef does it differently. She's South American. You keep on eating Uruguayan meatballs, then, they're going straight to your arse, girl. Thanks, Antonio. Bye, bye! Why are you interested in Wisconsin, Auxi? I don't know, but... since I was a little girl, I always loved saying "Wisconsin". I don't know why. Wisconsin. Wisconsin. I like saying it. It's a word that brings me peace and makes me feel good about myself. That's like poetry. Well, aren't you dangerous... Because the USA, truth be told, left us in the lurch with Perejil Island. It has to be said, even if it hurts. - Jesus, where did you find this family? - What? What happened? Ana? MANAGING DIRECTOR Good morning, Mr Agustin. They said you wanted to see me, sir. Aurora, Eulogio, what are you doing here? What a disaster, Carmen. I had a terrible night. It's a mess, Carmen, it's such a shock... Why am I even here talking to you? Cheer up, Jesus. There's nothing to be cheerful about, Carmen. You almost drowned Granny. Three students have been hospitalised for a laxative overdose. Antonio polished off the Rioja. And you... spanked the Council President. - How was I to know...? - The director found it so strange that she wants to meet you in person. This... this is the end. I mean, when she sees... this, what will happen then? In fact, I know, she'll fire me and report you for fraud. Fraud? Me? Fine, yes. I feel bad for you, Jesus. If it's any consolation, - I got fired, too. - What? Why? Just a silly little matter. Someone had to take the rap and that someone was me. It certainly wasn't the best idea I've ever had. No, it wasn't, Carmen. You could end up in jail. Who did we kill, my God? Just so you know, after the manager's visit, our lives are going to be one big nightmare. I'm going to get a blood test. - Not now, I'm putting Granny to bed. - It won't take long. I feel a little responsible. You? I don't think it's your fault. I was really angry. I shouldn't have poked fun at you. So... I'm sorry, I really am. I guess you had every right. I mean... we conned you. It doesn't matter. How about, for the time we have left here together, we try to get on? No more wheelchair attacks. No more comments about my family? - I'm putting Granny to bed. - Shall I help? No, she's a bit tricky, she only likes what she knows. I'm her hero, you see. Handsome. Hey, sucker! Are you a priest, or what? Look at that watch he's wearing. How about this watch? Don't you have one the same? Son of a bitch! That watch is mine. - No, no, it's my watch. - No, it's not your watch. I'll tear your eyes out if you touch my Wisconsin! - What are you doing? Fuck! - It's fine, friends. Friends, my arse! Shut your mouth, this is my neighbourhood. What are you doing? He always has to have the last word. The last word with what? - Hey, that's enough, eh? - Enough of what, Auxi? Incredible. Incredible? What's incredible? I'll rip your glasses off. "Amazi, shmazi"! Messi what, fucking priest? You're cruising for a bruising... Great, you're prettier with your mouths shut. Come on, mate. I'll go if I want to, mate. What are you doing here? I had to see you. - You're the Queen of the South. - Shut up, you're making me horny. I want you to be my sister. What the fuck do you mean, Wisconsin? Your sister? Yesterday we were playing tonsil tennis... I mean to teach me the Sevillanas danc - Olé. - Ah, yes. - For the competition. - Yes, you scared me. I'll teach you some Latin. Get on with you. Freedom, Arielito, can only be obtained in two ways. One, with a lot of money, and two, learning to live with next to nothing. That's the way it is. Now, you can't seek freedom with somebody else's money. Have someone else pay for your freedom? No! That's the stuff of slaves, Arielito. Am I right? Of course I am. What's up, little ones? Are you OK? Let me introduce you to a friend. This is... - Wisconsin. - Cameron. Wisconsin. These are my kids. I teach them to dance and a little English. How about we show them how to dance Sevillanas? Great! Let's go, then. Stand up straight, eyes up and chests out. Right foot forwards, left foot back and let's go. Stamp, one, two and the tip. In the different steps, the arms open outwards and come up on the inside. If my left foot comes forward, my left arm comes down and if my right foot comes forward, my right arm comes down. And Pasada, one, two, three, four, five, six. Paseíllo. Hands always rotating on the wrist. And fingers also moving like... as if we're opening a fan. Pasada, one, two, three, and... The whole body swings without stopping and that movement transfers rhythmically to all parts of the body so that you and your partner feel that same rhythm of seduction and feria. We can't wait to get started. Go on. - Hello. - Sit down, you're just in time. I just came to bring him back. No, sit down next to me, damn it. Budge up a bit. The stew's a bit runny, I had to put ten litres of water in, but I'm glad you're all here because I have an idea for the director's visit. - Another idea, Carmen? - This one's good. - Make her meatballs. - No, better. Mum, don't you think that's enough of your ideas? We have to try, don't we? Don't make a mountain out of a molehill. No, but... I think that's enough. Just let me tell you about it, love. Who wants to hear my idea? Who wants to hear it? I said that's enough. Enough of what? Of your crazy ideas, for example? - What? - Your stupid plans? - Anita... - No. Stew for how many, Mum? - For ten? - And? We look like a family of loons. It's embarrassing. - You're ashamed of your family? - No. You're ashamed of being poor. OK, let's... Look, Ana, I work like a dog to keep this house going, I pay for your studies and, at my table, there'll always be a bowl of stew for whoever wants one. Are we done? That's enough. I have a little problem but I'll solve it. I'll solve it for my family, for Jesus and for Ariel. And for the neighbourhood, too. We need to see hard-working and honourable people get on in life. - It's really encouraging. - Shut up. And if, to keep my family afloat, I have to steal, scam or whatever, I'll do it, let me tell you. - Don't get... - Shut up. And if that embarrasses you, nobody asked you to join me. Are we done? We're done. Sweetie. Where are you going? Me? Out with my wife. "Two of us in a little room, poison you drank, poison I'll drink". Mum! Oh, my little girl. - I'd do anything for you, Mum. - I know. And sometimes I blame myself for it, my love. Let's do it. What about them? That's family, I guess. - What's the plan? - The plan is very simple. We just have to behave like exactly what we are... a completely normal family. Jesus! Come on, quickly, let's go. - Brayan, don't touch anything, OK? - Why would you say that? Silence! All this money but not enough for a lift, eh? Come on. Careful. Come on, let's go. Oh my God. It's minimalist, isn't it? Aurori? The flat's empty, what's going on? They're renovating it. Now you tell me! Every time I ask for help, you get me into trouble. What do I do now? The neighbour in flat B. He's never home. Yes, he goes to see his daughters. He's all by himself. Well, it could be a solution. Yes. Hey, listen, how's your Eulogio? - Oh, I know, depression is... - Mum! Yes? Go ahead. Yes. What? Who? No way, José! Always use La Piara Foie gras for your macaroni. - Mum! - Carmen! I have to go, I'm busy. Why are you just standing there? Let's go! Nobody's home. Come on, let's go. Perfect. Antonio, come with me. Sit here. At the desk, here. You sit there. There, sweetie. No. No. Oh, Brayan, you stand out like a sore thumb here... Never mind, I'll put you somewhere. Now we wait for the director to buzz. She'll buzz flat A. - Elena Morgades? - Y Cifuentes. Of course... Wasn't it flat A? - It's B. - No, I buzzed flat A. - Flat B. - No, flat A. - Flat B. - No. You said on the phone. I think I know where I live. I can see you're art lovers in this house. We absolutely love art here. Stop messing around, Brayan! I can't breathe in here, fuck! Who the hell is this? He's our neighbour's son, he's a little crazy. But I don't let him anywhere near my Ariel. Come on, let's go. Welcome, Director. This is Ana, my sister. Pleased to meet you, Director. It's a pleasure to meet you in person and I'm delighted you had the courtesy to visit us. The pleasure is mine. Just by looking at you and hearing you, I can tell that you are exceptionally well-educated in this house. Precisely, you've no idea what I've learnt so far. Welcome to our humble home, Mr Director, sir. A glass of sherry? No, thank you, it's too early for me. I don't remember him talking like that. - Why are you talking like that? - It just came out. It's the nerves. And this is my mother. She's a widow. We always put her next to the plant, as she grew up in the country... And this is my little Antoñito. The whippersnapper's introverted... Antoñito, say hello, love. The name's Bolo Ariel's bro, innit? If you mess with me You're messing with him... That was quite clear. There's someone else? There he is, my dad! Your dad? Yes, my dad. Me? Her dad? - Daddy! - Granddad! Ambrosio? - What? - Yes, Mum, it's Dad. Hey, my name's not Ambrosio. - Wasn't she a widow? - She may as well be. We've lost him to Alzheimer's. I don't have Alzheimer's! Oh, when he gets like this it breaks my heart. Ambrosio. Ambrosio! Enough with Ambrosio! Who the fuck is Ambrosio? Carlos Rivas Montiel. Since I was born! A comrade from the army. See? His memories are all jumbled. I'm fed up with this bullshit! Everybody out of my house! Same thing every day. It's hard, but I'm learning a lot. Auxi and Wisconsin are in flat A. Flat A. - Wasn't it flat A? - That's what I said! Pleased to meet you. I didn't see you. Wisconsin and I come over every day, because... we love being in this house. Don't we, Wisconsin? It's the best one in Seville. Of course it fucking is. It's mine! - Where did he come from? - Eh? From his room. Dad's not doing too well today. Granddad's on bad form today, isn't he? I'm not your granddad! Either you get out of my house or I'll call the police! Not the police. - Daddy, calm down, please. - Don't touch me. - This visit is of prime importance. - Hands off me, you bastard! My... ...pill. Where are they, Daddy? Over there, my son. There, there Dad. Take one of these... and just relax. Thank you, my girl. Ambrosio. Ambrosio. Yes, yes. Ambrosio. Ambrosio. Same thing every day. It's been a hectic visit, but it's clear that Ariel has everything he needs. That's right, Ma'am. I have everything I need. Very well, I have nothing more to say. It was a pleasure meeting you. I'll see you at the flamenco competition. We're going to win! Bye, mi Arma. Come back whenever you want, but give us some warning. Mum, you can join us with a cheers today, OK? Cheers, my sweetie. Gentlemen! - Cheers! - Olé. Mum. Goodness me. Listen, Jesus. Now that everything's fine, we wanted to discuss an idea that we've had. - See what you think. - Another idea? Listen, Jesus, it's a good one. Right. The thing is, we're enjoying this business of hosting students. We did have a few teething problems at first... But we've learnt from our mistakes... And now we think, that... I mean... Hang on. "The Galíndez Parra family offers a very family-orientated and loving environment for the student, Granny included, which is sure to delight the visitor. As well as healthy and nutritious food: Croquettes, spinach...", all the good stuff, Jesus. - Yes, yes. - "With their own private room and a well-equipped bathroom that's cleaned twice a day. Flip-flops obligatory". Or maybe the flip-flops should be optional? Jesus, with your help, I think we could be leaders in this field. What do you think? Antonio, Carmen... - I see it. - You do? - You see it working? - I do! Oh! - You've done so much for this family. - Let's toast. - To the future. - To the future! Ambrosio... Ambrosio! Everybody out, for fuck's sake! That sounds good. - I'm "sharp", too. - You wish, loser. What, nitwit? You didn't learn that here, eh? Come on, practice. All four of them, eh? What a pair, always fighting, but always together. They're inseparable. I think they dance because the Sevillanas dance is like. It's like a love story with a happy ending. Look, in the first section, the woman shows off and the typical man goes after her. In the second, they allow themselves to get closer, to... To get to know each other a little. In the third, the spell breaks. They get angry, there's deceit. See the stamping? And the lovers end up with their backs to each other. And, in the fourth, calm returns, and they dance with marked face-offs, and almost end up rubbing faces, like... a reconciliation. Get it? A love story with a happy ending. That's it. You passed the theory exam. Ready for your practical? Ariel's a nice boy. He's nice to everybody, like one of the family. Mum, that's enough about Ariel. You get attached easily, Mum. And then you suffer. ROOTS: THE SAGA OF AN AMERICAN FAMILY Listen, you know that I know what hard work is, I was a shop steward for 20 years, but what they did to Black people is just despicable. I'm disgusted. Well, it's over now. What's important is that they can do what they want now. They can even be President of the United States. Can you imagine our Ariel as president? If he wants to be president, that's fine with me. That would be perfect. As long as he's happy, right? Drugs were invented by the white racist government to control us in the ghetto. Ana. We need to talk. OK then, you're still muddling your steps and lack rhythm, but you're doing OK. Not about Sevillanas. And you don't think I have rhythm? Whatever, whatever... That's not what I want to talk about. It's something else. I was wondering if you... like me, also feel like... doing this. No fucking way. No, no. No, and what's more, you're leaving soon and I don't want... "so"? How can I get through to you, Ariel? We need to talk, Auxi. Tell me tomorrow, I have to go with Ana. Anal. What? Head over heels? Head over heels, girl. Let's go for a beer. This Is our Vietnam, my friend. Ariel, it's Jesus, I've found you a new family. Great. This is Simba, a young five-year-old male. He's an Asiatic lion, an endangered species in a European breeding programme... I will always be... against slavery. Good. - Bye, Bolo. - Bye, man. You're a great Black dude. That's the nicest thing I've ever heard. Bye, Granny. Ariel, sweetie. Sweetie. Don't worry, I'm fine, it's just that I made loads of meatballs and who's going to eat them now? Because you have to go, but, look... now you can take them with you. Carmen, please, we can't arrive at the new house with a container full of meatballs. Come on, Ariel. Go on, off with you. Ariel, let's go. You're free. I'm free? I'll stay. - Ariel, don't be silly. - That's why I'm staying, to do and say crazy things, but, above all, I'm staying because I... - I want to tell you... - We're on telly! Let him finish. We're on telly! It's a bit like Animal House, but Andalusia-style. These videos are going viral in the USA, right, Megan? - Megan? - Yes, that's right. It's about a young American boy who is in Seville. He expected to be hosted by an upper-class family and, we don't know why, but he ended up in a lower-class one. - How did it happen? - Well, basically, the family conned the agency and Ariel. And he sent me these videos to give us a laugh and make us feel a bit better. - Because, Megan, you're his...? - I'm his girlfriend, we're getting married next year. Kisses, Ariel! Hang on in there. His girlfriend, great. Let's watch some more videos. That's right. Man, people like you give our race a bad name. Bolo... And to think I bent over backwards for your freedom, my lad. I don't understand, Ariel, how could you? Carmen... Carmen, I swear... - Honestly... - No. I never want to see you again. Ariel, let's go, this isn't the time. They're coming. - Hello, how are you? - Hello! Well, Ariel, meet your mother. Hello, Ariel. This is Manuela and Cayetana. - Hello. - Pleased to meet you. No. "Only in English, please”, their English is terrible. - They're on their phones all day. - Ariel's English isn't bad at all. What a beautiful house. He's from Ohio. My Wisconsin is from Ohio. Have you heard of anywhere uglier? - Ariel! - Ariel! - I'll give it to him. - I will. No! I'll give it to him. Love, this is for bread, this is for milk. And this is for you. - I like you in a uniform... - Oh, my Antonio. Mum, I'm off. Have your Eko with your biscuits. - So pretty. - I'm going to a party. Lunch is in the fridge. Next week, I promise. And the timing at the end, go right through to five. And your positioning. The rest is fine. Wisconsin! Don't call me Wisconsin, I don't deserve it. Ready, Ariel? Right, guys, let's get started. Everybody in position. Put your right foot forward. Wait up, girl. CAN WE TALK? - We're on the telly. - We're back with Megan and her Animal House videos in Seville. What can I say? I hardly recognise myself there. I look fatter, don't I? - The telly makes you fat. - What? Three and a half kilos, at least. - Or more. - Four. Look at our little boy. Don't you dare do that again! What the hell are you doing? Good one! Just look at them. So uncouth. Shall I change channels? No. Ariel, not all families are the same. You're right. There are bad families, good families and families that are... wonderful. Watch your mouth, Manuel Jesus, goodness. What does "motherfucker" mean? Paco! Open the door! You bastard! You evicted them! Open the door and show your face. Paco's not here. - Where is he? - At the funeral parlour. - He's dead? - No, not him. The granny, Carmen's mum. Granny's dead? Yes, poor thing. I couldn't go, my varicose veins are playing up, you know? I went to the clinic yesterday to talk to Dr José Maria and I said to Dr José Maria: "Dr José Maria, look here, I don't...". Dear Granny, I'll never see you again, because you'll be in heaven and I'll be in hell. No, no. Yes. Let's not kid ourselves. I do want to say something. In this life, I built up my body for one reason only and it wasn't to steal or hit anybody. - Yeah, yeah... - No! It was so I could pick Granny up and take her to the park, because she was always so good to me. She was young at heart. She liked coming to the park with us and Bolo would always buy some of those apple sweets that are really sour and, well, we'd laugh at the funny faces she pulled. It's such a shame. Take this for luck, handsome. - Hello. - Hello. I need you to do me a favour. The sweetest in the neighbourhood! Everybody should know. And she always treated me like a granddaughter. Like Ana? She treated me the same way. God bless you, sweetie. Does anybody else want to speak? I do. I'm so sorry about Granny's death. With all my heart. I went to your house because... Because I wanted to show you something. ...it's that, you can't choose your family. You get what you're given. You show up one day, and there they are. It would be great to be able to choose, to make it perfect. To choose the most generous one in the world where there's always a plate of food for anybody who turns up. One that's so much fun and so optimisti that nothing could ever get you down. To choose a dad who, time and time again, wants to put himself in your place, to really understand you. One that doesn't need to explain love or respect, or hard work or solidarity, as these are things you see every day at home. And I wish I could choose to have them forgive you when you really mess things up. If I could choose my family, mine would look a lot like this one. Anal. - Ana! - Leave me alone. Granny. Don't worry, Carmen, I'll stay with her. Ana. I didn't want those videos to come out. That's not why I sent them. I messed things up and I need you to forgive me. You're forgiven. But you lied to me. I'm not with Megan anymore because I've fallen in love with someone else. Someone else? A girl that dances really well. I just said a load of things about her family. Yeah, I get it. But you're forgetting the most important thing. Who makes the best meatballs in the world? That, and something else. That, when somebody joins this family, they stay forever. Carmen, can I come home? Auxi. Wisconsin. Or whatever you're called. Auxi, I'm so sorry. You're so fucking dangerous. Life is the time you waste Looking for the exit. You look stunning, love! Life is much easier. Life is but a stain Of carmine on your cheek. Life is the intermittent embrace Of the waves against the shore. Life is signals. That wake you up And stop you falling asleep in the Chai. Don't you dare think that luck Is yours for the rest of your life. Could she be prettier? And if the day comes, I'll dance. When the time comes I'll shout: "What joy!" And that's what I'll take with me I'm so lucky! There you go, such art! Come on, let's go! Life is the time that escapes Between tripping and falling. Beauties! Life is the doctor Who is fair and wise. Who heals you calmly. Life is an intelligent thread That mends any wound. Life is in the details The memories and the places. It's a verse every day. Life is a spectacular journey With its ups and downs. Look at Wisconsin go! And if the day comes, I'll dance. When the time comes I'll shout: "What joy!" And that's what I'll take with me I'm so lucky! Olé! And the winning couple in this Sevillanas dance competition.. The winning couple is... Ana and Ariel. The surprise prize is a trip to Ariel's hometown for the whole host family. - Olé, you're off to Brooklyn. - And you're coming, too. Wow, I'd love to! Look, look! - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. WHEN BROOKLYN MET SEVILLE Remember a few months ago we told you about a family from Seville who went viral in the USA unintentionally? Well, now they're viral here, too, with their own video channel. Hello my people, my good people. Today, we're doing an unboxing, unboxing, unboxing, of this special reserve plonk which has kindly been sent to us by our dear friend Castaneda. What's up, dudes? Today we're doing the #FullMouthChallenge, salmorejo-style. The boy's got flow. The boy's got flow. All the wine needs is its freedom. Freedom. Freedom. To improve its destiny, which is to be drunk by me. Get with it or I'll crush you, bitch. Fuck you, you cheated. Freedom! Smell that. It's marvellous. I've been working hard, but it's better than making a living like you, bunch of lazybones. And don't miss next week's episode because you'll get my recipe for tuna with onions.
