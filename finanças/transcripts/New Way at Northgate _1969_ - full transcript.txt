- (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) - (CHATTERING) NARRATOR: These six ladies have lived together in Northgate for more than thirty years. The hospital suffers from the problems facing all such institutions. Remote, and physically isolated from the community. Too many patients, crowded into badly designed buildings. A shortage of staff and money. Ever since Northgate was founded in 1938, its ideas of treatment and care have been largely determined by the needs of the long-staying, low-grade patient. It is because of this traditional attitude that Elizabeth Tate and her companions remain institutionalised, and have no outlet, other than part-time work outside the hospital. This will not happen in the future. Northgate is now a hospital with a totally new conception of how it can best serve those who are mentally subnormal. - Can I hold it? - WOMAN: No, I must hold it. NARRATOR: Severe subnormality is not a mental illness. It is a permanent disability, and cannot be cured. Nevertheless, any additional physical or psychiatric disorder from which a subnormal person may in some cases also suffer, can be treated by modern methods of intensive therapy. If hospitals were to concentrate on reducing these secondary handicaps, many of those patients who are now institutionalised would be able to return and live in the outside community. This is the policy which Northgate has put into practice. It has happened as a direct result of the appointment, in 1965, of a new Superintendent, Dr Peter Sykes. Well, the exercise really, when I came here originally, was to try and introduce a programme that was community-orientated, as distinct from a programme that was hospital-orientated. And the hospital is only as good to the community as the people in the community think it is, so that community relations are of vital importance from this aspect. - Good morning, Mrs. Hunter. - Hello, Mrs. Legard. Dr Sykes just asked me to tell you that we're all organised about the wheelchair for Robert. Must be a bit difficult for you, you know, with all this messing the bed and things, - and all the washing and that. - (CHILD WHOOPING) Washing sheets all the time, you know. That line outside is never... never empty. There's a letter here, says he had no dinner yesterday. Right. But he had mince and dumplings last night. (CHUCKLING) All right, cheerio! MOTHER: Well, for a start, he can't sit up. And, I mean, that's a big handicap. I mean, you have to carry him flat, and he gets terribly heavy. You can't just carry him around. There we are. - There we are. - There we are! - Righto. - Bye-bye, darling. MOTHER: They take him off in a minibus, and then he has his physiotherapy on the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the other two days, - on the Tuesday and Thursday... - Bye-bye, darling. He's more or less... he's just up there so I can have a rest. SYKES: It's vital that the people in the community feel that the hospital is part of the community. TEACHER: This morning, later on in the morning, I'm going to take you to Northgate Hospital. Now, I have a feeling that very few of you actually know the workings of this hospital, although it's right on your doorstep. Northgate is a hospital for subnormal people. As far as you people are concerned, at the top end of a grammar school, you're above normal intelligence, otherwise you wouldn't be here. You're going to be members of all sorts of professions, you're going to be doctors and lawyers and teachers and nurses, and, some time in your life, you may well come against a problem concerning a mentally handicapped person. I think the scheme that we've adopted of trying to influence the community through youth, I think this is, er... um... a very valuable scheme. I think it's a scheme that's more likely to pay dividends in the long term than any other type of formal influence of the community, by advertising or things such as this. But, I think by doing it this way, the long-term results that you reap will be very much greater, though it may take a little while before these show. Mrs. Hunter? SYKES: When I first came here, the hospital was running on very traditional lines, and there were a waiting list for... I think it was 188 patients for permanent admission and permanent care. Now, we have no waiting list for permanent admission and permanent care now at all. And, at any one time, we have an admission waiting list of about 26, for short-term care of varying lengths to deal with specific problems. MAN: was actually beginning to read, this poor lad, and chipping away at... SYKES: My overall policy, as I see it, for the hospital, is to get patients out and back into the community. This is a function of any hospital, as I see it. WOMAN: Oh, in the average type of hospital, this sort of child would be in bed all the time. They wouldn't play, they wouldn't be up. And, despite the fact that they are incontinent, some of them, they're still up, and they are being slowly trained, toilet trained. We're seeing in practice what at one time was just theory, that these children could be brought on and developed to their full potential. â€”High! High! One, two, three... (CHILD CHEERING) WOMAN: We don't think of them as "subnormal" at all. They're... They are children that, you know... like any other child, and they're treated as far as possible the same. MAN: We've now progressed, as far as the patients are concerned, from one of near vegetation... Although they were well cared for in those days, just the same, but it was more or less getting them up, getting them dressed, looking after them during the day, and putting them back to bed. That was more or less their activities. Now, since Dr Sykes' current approach, we've got industrial therapy units going on, physiotherapy for the children that was non-existent in those days, and the children have made great strides. They've learned... been taught to eat, they're taught to spoon-feed themselves. A lot of this didn't go on in those days. There wasn't enough time spent with them. PHYSIOTHERAPIST: The younger we get the children, the better the result is obviously going to be, because apart from preventing contractures at an early age, early stimulation's terribly important. We've been given an awful lot of scope here, I must say. We feel, in a way, quite ruined that we've been allowed to do whatever we like, we've been encouraged. Anything we ask for, we usually get. And this of course has been of great encouragement to us. So, if you learn to carry her like this, she's got her back extended... PHYSIOTHERAPIST: If they're flexed, they must be put into extension. If they're stiff and in extension, they must be bent. And we show the nurses how to do this, and their positions are changed right through the day. Now, when you pick Keith up, he's inclined to be very rigid and straight, so always flex him up into this position and carry him in this position. See that his arms are forwards. PHYSIOTHERAPIST: We believe that, in other hospitals, the same type of child is left all day in a cot. There's no stimulation at all. A side movement like this, keeping her nose straight. PHYSIOTHERAPIST: Because it's stimulation that's going to help these children to develop, and there's none if they just lie in bed. support of this wall. It's lovely, it fits into the curves of his body. Now, you look after his arms and hands. Try and get this stiff left arm straightened out and turned round - So, the palms are facing each other. - (GASPING) That's a good boy. Round there. Now, you hold on to his arms. Keep them extended like that. You see how this arm in particular is very bent, and the hand twisted round in this position, so, the aim is to get... If you put your hand over their elbow joint, you can usually extend it, straighten it, and turn it round, all in one movement. That's a good boy! Look how he's lifting his head. That's a very clever boy. That's a very clever boy. PHYSIOTHERAPIST: We had to start at the very bottom and think, "What can the children do? "What would children of that mental age "want to do to enjoy themselves?" Concentration was so terribly short that it had to be made into a game, and you have to start right at the very bottom as far as exercises went, to start off with the things they could do, like rolling round the floor and attempting to sit up before they could do anything else. (MUSIC PLAYING) The only way we felt we could get them to keep on repeating these things, to make it interesting at all, is to set the thing to music, to put it on a tape, with all the instructions and the pieces of music in the correct sequence, so that, by the time they'd finished working through a tape, they had done all the movements which were necessary for their various conditions. The children get to know the sequence and they know them off by heart and they know exactly what to do. Even the very subnormal ones know which movement they're supposed to be doing to the various pieces of music. And also, the nurses can come and run through this tape when we aren't here at all. Mothers can come in with their children as outpatients and work to the tape, with the instructions on. And so, this is the system on which we work now, that we try to think of anything that would give those children pleasure. Harder! Harder! Good boy. Okay, try again. (MUSIC PLAYING) Okay? Push! Away! Push! Harder! Harder! Harder! Push! That's a good boy. Push! Going to do this one. Big push. Push. Hard. PHYSIOTHERAPIST: We have been absolutely astounded at the progress that has been made by some of them. The thing is to remember what they were like at the beginning and think that if they didn't have the correct handling by the nurses, and the necessary stimulation, they would end up as permanently contracted adults in prams. Push! Good boy. That's lovely. I think that the biggest advance that we've achieved on the medical side is the introduction of general practitioners doing all the general medical work within the hospital. The reason that this is a big improvement is that it means for the first time we've got psychiatrists working in the hospital who can do psychiatry. Do you remember when I saw you as an outpatient? You used to tell me that you were troubled by a little girl who sat behind you and swore at you and said nasty things? Can you remember that? SYKES: I think there are a tremendous number of things in general psychiatry that can be applied extremely well in working with mentally handicapped people. They can't be applied directly, but they can be modified and moulded to fit in with the type of patients that we've got in a hospital such as this. PSYCHIATRIST: somebody hitting you the other day? Er... Yeah, it were the Queen Mother. Her. Who was it? The Queen Mother! - What was she doing? - With a big stick. - With a big stick? - Yes. Also in this class, you'll find two children who are termed technically as "hyperkinetic". These are over active children, and you'll see that they will be going all over the room, all over the place, and they'll be running, talking, shouting, moving all the time. This is quite a difficult sort of child to have in a class, of course, and it's because they're over active that they're here and not out in training centres outside, because they're severely over active. - (CHILD SHOUTING) - Maureen's blind and... Very keen on music at the moment, aren't you, Maureen? All right, all right. I've brought some young ladies to see you, Maureen. Sit down and show us what you're doing. - Where?! - Here they are. Would you like to come through? Come and speak to Maureen. Hello, Maureen. Maureen's got a favourite song at the moment, haven't you, love? - Eh? - 'Plaisir d'Amour'. 'Plaisir d'Amour'. She's mad for the old 'Plaisir d'Amour'. She learned the tune on the piano. She knows the tune by ear to begin with, and then she just does it with one finger, and goes along the keyboard feeling for the notes. - What's your name? - Pat. (LAUGHING) Come here, my love! TEACHER: She can't hear anything that's going on, but she communicates all the time. She does it by sign language. She'll communicate with anyone at all. Never says a word, doesn't hear anything. Now, in contrast with a girl like this who doesn't speak and who doesn't hear, but communicates, we've got Janice. Now, Janice, here, speaks and hears every word, but she doesn't communicate at all. Sometimes, if you say something to her, she'll just say the same thing back. What's this, Janice? You press those. You press those. You press... Did you hear that? "You press those." "You press those," she says back. Just echolalic speech. SYKES: The idea that education is not something that just goes on for a few hours a day in a school classroom, but something which should be going on throughout the whole of the child's stay in the unit is very important, and it'll only come about by staff co-operation, and good staff motivation, and people working towards one end. We've a group of children who are extremely disturbed. Now, if a child is from a background where it's an accepted thing to go round the marketplace and pinch things, then, in fact, the child will do this. And he may not be maladjusted, he may, in fact, be very well adjusted, but to a maladjusted background. Father's in Rampton, her mother is unable to provide a home. We first had Christine when she was suspended from Cleaswell Hill School, and she came here, attending our school daily from the hostel in Morpeth. We've had very little trouble with her social behaviour over the past few weeks, and she's out working. - Is that right? - That's right, Doctor. Um... Until recently, her behaviour has been satisfactory, but whether it's because she's got the job or because she's come off the incentive scheme, I don't know, but her behaviour has definitely deteriorated. - PSYCHIATRIST: What, in the last week or so? - WOMAN: Over the last couple of weeks, yeah. PSYCHIATRIST: Could you let us have a report, Sheila? SHEILA: Well, as you know, we picked this job very carefully, because Christine didn't like working in the factory and she said she preferred domestic work to anything else. So, after a few weeks, we found this employer who is an ex-policeman, he knows how to deal with delinquent girls. We told him all about this girl, and he was willing to give her a try. She only works part-time. She's fetched in the morning, she's brought back at lunchtime, and she's supervised the whole time she's there. She started working terribly well, very interested, good worker, and they were absolutely delighted. PSYCHIATRIST: I gather she, um... did really try when she first went there, and was quite successful. SHEILA: Oh, she did, she worked very hard, and she's a grand worker when she wants to be. PSYCHIATRIST: Yes. Hello, Christine. Come and sit down in the chair here, will you? Well, you've been back at work a couple of days. How are you enjoying it? All right. - You glad to be back? - Uh-huh. PSYCHIATRIST: How do you think you get on down there? CHRISTINE: All right. PSYCHIATRIST: What do you think your work is like? CHRISTINE: I like it. PSYCHIATRIST: Yes, but how do you think you suit the employer? CHRISTINE: What do you mean? How do I what? PSYCHIATRIST: Do you think he's satisfied with your work? CHRISTINE: Well, I don't know. PSYCHIATRIST: In point of fact, Christine, when you first went there, you worked very well indeed. But just before you, er... went off sick, your work had been deteriorating. He said that you weren't getting it done, you were disappearing off and leaving things half-done. - Aye, that's right. - What about it? Hmm? - Were you? - Uh-huh. Why? Don't know. - SHEILA: Have you lost interest in the job? - No. We told you that it was just a temporary job, to see how you liked that sort of work, and we've eventually got to move you on to a more permanent full-time job, haven't we? - Mm-hmm. - And think of your future. This is just the beginning, Christine. You've got to stick at it, you know. What happens when a patient's discharged? Is there, you know, a set procedure that you go through each time? No, there's no set procedure at all. Patients are all different, they've all different problems, so we can't have a set thing which is going to be the same for everybody. Well, her sister's not at all well. Her brother-in-law's had an accident and, in any case, they're very worried about having her back at this point in time because she's been such... You know, her behaviour's been so difficult. SYKES: Come into the office, Martha. Go on. Sit down, Martha. Now... Now, we've got a little problem, Martha. You... You know that you were expecting to go home today? Well, unfortunately, this can't be arranged. MAN: Well, your sister isn't very well, Martha, and your brother-in-law's had an accident, so they just feel they can't take you at the moment. Apart from which, they're a bit worried about what your behaviour was like when you were at home before. You remember you ran away a couple of weekends ago? I'll go back to the factory the day I come out. I'll prove it to you. Yes. Your place is still there at the factory. SYKES: They've still got the place for you. Can you ask me sister if I can go camping with her? MAN: Well, that's... That's a few weeks ahead yet. You'll have to stay here for the next two or three weeks until your sister's ready to take you again. Four weeks or three weeks? Well, we'll not say definitely. SYKES: We won't give you a definite date, then you won't be disappointed again. But will they come up and see me? SYKES: There's no doubt that the local authorities are a very vital link in this overall scheme of getting patients back home. It's quite impossible for the hospital to get adequate community care unless the local authorities co-operate in this. MAN: Hospital nurses work in our training centres, alongside our training centre staff. We have outpatient clinics in our training centres with hospital doctors, local authority training centre staff, local authority social workers, all working together. MAN #2: Sheriff Lees is very much like a school both in layout and outlook and, um... in effect, a school where the teaching is at a slower rate. What colour is that? - Blue. - No, it's yellow! What colour is it? - Yellow. - Yellow! That's right. Rub it in. SYKES: Most hospitals go to a local authority and say, "We want you to do this." And this is no good at all. You've got to offer something in return. You've got to say, "Look, if you will do this for us, "we will do that for you." And if you approach it on this give-and-take kind of business, I've always found local authorities are extremely co-operative. Like that. And another one. MAN: Most of the children are brought in by ambulance transport around nine in the morning and go home again at three or three-thirty in the afternoon. The hospital sends three nurses to the local authority on a rota system. One of them works for a month with the social work staff doing routine social work under the supervision of a professionally qualified worker, and the other two spend... I think it's two months working in Sheriff Lees, assisting in the classes there. One of the nurses said that before she came to work for a while in the community she felt that a handicapped child's life began when they were admitted to hospital and ended when they were discharged, and it was very helpful for her to see this in a much wider perspective and see the sort of whole thing of the child at home going into hospital, and coming out of hospital back to home again. SYKES: There's a great tendency to think, "Oh, the hospital can do this job, " or "The local authority can do this job. " Well, the answer is that neither of them can do the job without the other. I don't think there's any doubt about this at all. So you've got to deliberately forge links like this between the local authority and the hospital. One of the important reasons for holding outpatient clinics in the local authority centres as well as in the hospitals is that, in the sense that we can meet the social worker, we can meet the class teacher, we can see the child and we can get the parent. In other words, we can get the whole of the background information. Terry's still, um... acting out in class, and teacher has all sort of reports of, um... fairly bizarre behaviour, making snakes with Plasticine and so on. MAN: The larger number of problems dealt with in the centre clinics are those referred by the teaching staff because they have noticed regression or are having difficulty in managing a particular child. And obviously the parents will have to be brought into this a great deal. Visits would be made to the parents by a social worker, and our relationship with the medical staff at the hospital is such that they're prepared to accept the recommendation of the social worker in saying whether or not a child should be re-admitted to hospital. He won't mix in, Dr Sykes. - He just won't mix in. - No. How does he spend his time? What kind of things does he do? Digs the garden, plays with worms. He digs the garden, plays with worms, yeah. What way does he play with the worms? Well, he uses a spoon. I bought him a little spade. He doesn't use the spade, he just uses a spoon. - Yeah. - Gets them and cuts them in little bits. - Oh, I see. - When I kiss him, he goes like this with his hands. He's enjoying it. SYKES: When I talk about the hospital having a revolving door policy, what I really mean is we have a policy of planned re-admission. It means that parents and relatives are able to organise their lives relative to this, in that they're able to know that he's going to go into hospital, he's going to be in hospital, training, having his treatment, et cetera, for X weeks or X months, even, then he's going to come out and he's going to be at home for X weeks or X months, and we're going to go to the outpatient clinic and they're going to tide us over until the time comes up for his next re-admission. SYKES: Would you like to come back into Northgate, Terry, just for a little while? MOTHER: Tell the doctor. Do you want to go to the hospital? No. (MASSED CLAPPING) (CLAPPING STOPS) You happy? A lot of fun. Well done. Staff who have been trained originally, nursing staff, many medical staff, too, who've been trained originally through a concept of a hospital with patients who are staying in the hospital for long periods of time have got to radically reorientate their thinking if they're going to come over to a concept of patients going home and staying at home and, in fact, of the hospital having a very much higher discharge function than is usually the case with a hospital of this nature. The nurses now have more freedom. There's a charge nurse now, in the treatment centre. I've got more control of the staff, more control of the patients. What shall I say? Much more scope. Much more scope to run your ward. It's so different. Years ago, all the running of the ward and the patients came from the administrators, but not now. The old system, you tended to get all decisions referred to the top. And not a great feedback. But now, you're making your own decisions and then you consult. Well, having a better staff relationship with staff at all levels. In other words, which, er... all the staff are individuals, just as the patients are. His main achievement, and I speak now as a layman, has been to build up good relations between all departments in the hospital. And I've found that, by so doing, that all departments have co-ordinated together to work for the well-being and the welfare of the patient. We've achieved this, by and large, by discussion, I think, by allowing staff to express their views on a variety of problems that they come up against on the wards, and by seeing the overall administration as being to lay down guidelines rather than lay down very rigid policies. you know, and tend to think that people don't need to be trained to look after these type of patients. WOMAN: I mean, there's lots of good nurses here that haven't sat any examinations. I could class myself as a good nurse and I've sat no examinations. WOMAN #2: Do you think the nursing exams that we sit really applies to the work that we are doing? ALL: Do we all feel, really, that we are nurses? Just to go back to your first point, what you said then, if we were going to drop the name "nurse" as such, what do you think we should substitute on? Has anybody else any suggestions, what we're going to substitute for the word "nurse"? Not really. More of a teacher than a nurse. WOMAN #3: We are really educating patients, children and adults, aren't we, to their... more or less to their fullest capabilities? MAN: This is our one general aim, isn't it, to get everybody to the best of their capabilities, even inside the hospital and for the community. Yes, and to fit them to go outside into the community, really, to lead as normal a life as possible. The most important aspect, which you've to be aware of, is that good learning is facilitated by warm relationships. Now, let me give you an example of what I mean. Now, suppose little three-year-old Johnny is running outside in the playground. He falls down, and he grazes his knee. Now, as a nurse, probably your training would say, "bring the child in, sit him down, "get out all your sterile this, your sterile that, "get your antiseptics, clean him down, "put on a nice dressing and that is fine." And away the child goes. But, in fact, Mum doesn't do this, does she? Certainly, she cleans the wound and puts a plaster on it, but Mum does something else which is very important. Mum will cuddle the child until the tears have stopped and reassures the child, and then, in fact, the child is happy and runs away. And this is an aspect that we mustn't forget about. (MUSIC ONLY ON SOUNDTRACK) This section agreed that the term "nurse" referred to someone who tended the sick, and this did not generally apply here. INSTRUCTOR: Turn it right over, and shake out the creases. At the side which is open here, take it over three, four squares. Take the pieces out. And then half it again, push out the creases again. Halved again. One. Like that. And then half again. The group felt that they did not lose any respect by wearing civvies rather than uniform, but they did feel, however, that the term "nurse" should still be used, especially in disturbed adolescent wards, and with the children. - (BANGING) - (CHATTERING) Have a good look through and see which one you like. No? You liked that one, didn't you? So there's another young lady liked... that one. MAN: You can get your size, you see. - You can get your size, if you like it. - MAN: I like the style, not the dress. WOMAN: Do you like this one? Have you seen it? Come and have a look. I think you want six inches off it. MAN: Go ahead. I don't mind seeing your legs, but I don't want to see your bottom. In every question, there's always two sides of looking at this. And, for instance, you can say, "Oh, well, it's cheaper if we have the nurses doing the domestic work "rather than employing domestics to do this." But this is in fact a very false argument. You can look at it from another viewpoint. You can say, "Well, look, here you have these nursing staff. "We've paid consultants Â£3.10 an hour "to lecture to these people through a long course "to get them training. "ls it sensible, then, to take people that this money's been invested in "and put them down washing and scrubbing floors?" And, of course, the answer's no. I'm sure if one suggested to the HMC that one lectured to domestic staff at the same rate of pay, there'd be an uproar. WOMAN: Come on. Straight down, straight to the bottom. Come on, move along so everybody can get in. Right, Angela. Up, up. Put your head down. Mind the top. And between here is the adventure playground. You see where that large mound is there? That's the adventure playground. NARRATOR: In a routine rebuilding programme, Northgate is taking on a new shape. But all the more important changes have developed from within the old fabric and from inside a hidebound countrywide system that few administrators have attempted to break. Dr Sykes' policy has been to rethink the basic function of this hospital. If more administrators adopted this attitude, we may see a whole new pattern develop for the care of the subnormal. Hospitals could become specialised therapeutic centres, whilst new methods for residential care in the community would be devised. Northgate is in the forefront of this revolution. The staff have been filled with new enthusiasm for their roles, and, at the same time, have been given the responsibility of deciding what needs doing. But perhaps the most important achievement has been the creation of new links with the outside world. The deliberate policy of forming close and informal relationships between parents, patients, staff and the local community has dissolved the sense of isolation which surrounds many subnormality hospitals and which we are all too ready to accept as inevitable. Northgate Hospital has shown that we are wrong. - (LAUGHING AND CHATTERING) - WOMAN: Come on! Subtitles by Powerhouse Films LTD OCR by Pedotriba
