Say, what kind of a club is this? Oh, this is where Santa Claus is. Come on, boys. Come on. Leslie dear, I think I will go in to Singapore tonight. And exchange this rifle. It is not heavy enough for tigers. Well, don't be long. Because without you about I'm afraid I'm as nervous as a native. I won't. Don't worry. Well Robert, for heaven's sake go if you are going. You know Leslie, it makes me feel awkward and stupid to say some things. I'm not in the least clever. Because I don't say much, don't think I don't appreciate you being here with me. Only wives like you can make these godforsaken places bearable. Seven years on a rubber plantation. With no company but natives and a lot of dowdy planters' wives. Yes, Robert. That ought to be a test for a good wife. Well, I will be going now. Hang it all, I was forgetting the gun. Well, goodbye. Goodbye, Robert. Goodnight, boys. Yarma. Yarma. - Yes, Missy? Yarma, take this letter to Mr Hammond at once. Yes, Missy. Before you go, please .. Put the screens down. - Yes, Missy. "Yet each man kills the thing he loves." "By each, let this be heard." "Some do it with a bitter look. Some with a flattering word." "The coward does it with a kiss." "The brave men with a sword." [ Door knocks ] What is that? Come in. A letter. For you. For me? Is something wrong? Nothing. Is it that white woman again? No. You will not be gone so long? Only for about an hour. I shall be waiting. Amah. He lied to me. Come in, Geoffrey. Nice of you to come. Oh. Have a drink will you. Thanks. I will. I say. Is anything the matter? That note of yours was rather hectic. The affair can't go on any longer. I am at the end of my tether. Why, what's up? - Oh, don't pretend. What is the use of that. Why have you left me all this time without a sign? I've had an awful lot to do. You haven't had so much to do that you couldn't find time to write me a line. There didn't seem to be any object in taking useless risks. Don't take me for a perfect idiot please. I say, Leslie darling. If you sent for me to make a scene .. I am going to take myself off. - Geoffrey. Don't you know how I love you? Well darling, you have got a damn funny way of showing it. You drive me to desperation. Leslie, I wonder if you've noticed. We rarely meet now without having a row. Is that my fault? I don't say that. I dare say it's mine. But when that happens to two people who are on the sort of terms that we are .. It looks very much as though things were wearing a bit thin. What do you mean by that? Well. When that happens. The common-sense thing is to say .. We have had a jolly good time but all good things must come to an end. Geoffrey. I am all for facing facts. Oh. Geoffrey, what is that Chinese woman doing in your house? My dear, what are you talking about? - Don't take me for a perfect fool. Don't you think I know that you've been living with a Chinese woman for months. Nonsense. - A common slut from the kampong. My dear, if you listen to the gossip .. - I want to know what you were .. Doing with that Chinese woman in your house. I didn't know there was a China woman about. I have seen her. What is she like? Common and vulgar. You are not paying me a very pretty compliment. Geoffrey. Will you swear to me that she is not your mistress? Certainly. On your honour? - On my honour. That's a lie. - Alright then, it's a lie. In that case why don't you let me go? - Because I love you. Because I love you I tell you. Geoffrey, I love you. There is nobody ever going to love you like I love you. I can't go on without you. Without you I am just lost. I know at times that I have treated you so badly and .. Hurt you and all of that. But it is only because I am so unhappy. My dear. I don't want to make you unhappy but it is no good beating about the bush. The thing is over and done with. You can't mean that, Geoffrey. You can't mean that. Leslie, dear. I am terribly sorry but the facts are there you have got to face them. This is the end. And you've got to make the best of it. You wouldn't treat a dog like you are treating me. Is it my fault if I don't love you? Damn it all. One either loves or one doesn't. But I love you. You see, I love you. Oh Geoffrey, I tell you. I will do anything you wan me to do. I'll give you .. I'll do anything. It doesn't make any difference what. You won't even give me a chance. My god, why can't you be reasonable? I tell you I am sick and tired of the whole thing. Do you want me to tell you in so many words that you mean nothing to me? Don't you know it? Haven't you felt it? You must be blind. - Yes, I know. I know. Well I have felt it. I don't care. It isn't love any longer. It is madness. It's torture to see you. It's torture ten times worse not to see you. If you leave me now I will kill myself. I swear that I will kill myself. Go ahead. You don't think I mean it? You don't think I have got the courage? - I have no patience with you. You are enough to drive anyone out of his senses. You can do what you like or can say what you like but I tell you it is finished. Geoffrey, I won't let you go. I can't. I love you. I love you. I am fed up. Fed up. Understand? I am sick of the sight of you. Don't say that. Don't say that. - Yes, I will say that. And what is more, the China woman is my mistress. And I don't care who knows it. If you ask me to choose between you and her. I choose her. You wanted the truth. Alright then. Now you have it. Do you swear the evidence you shall give in this court .. Between our Sovereign the King and yourself .. Shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. What is your name? Mrs Robert Crosby. Mrs Robert Crosby, take the stand. Mrs Crosby. Perhaps it would be better if you told us the whole story in your own way. Do you think you could manage that? I will try. Well, on the .. On the evening of the tragedy. My husband was going to Singapore on business. I wasn't feeling very well so .. I stayed at home. I .. don't mind being alone because .. Planter's wives get used to that sort of thing. So I was sitting quietly working on my lace when .. I heard footsteps and someone came on the veranda. Yes .. go on, Mrs Crosby. Well, at first I didn't know who it was. And then he said: it is I Geoff Hammond. So I said: Hello there. Won't you come in. Were you surprised to see him? I was rather, because .. He hadn't been up to the house for ages. So I told him that Robert had gone to Singapore on business. What did he say to that? He said: I am sorry. Because I was feeling very lonely this evening and .. I thought perhaps I'd come along and just see how you folks were getting on. So he helped himself to a whiskey and soda. And lit his pipe. Was he quite sober? Well, I suppose he had been drinking. But it didn't occur to me just then. What happened? We were just chatting quite quietly. When suddenly he said something rather silly. What? I don't know if it is very worthwhile repeating it. But he paid me a little compliment. I think perhaps you had better tell us exactly what he said. He said you have got such beautiful eyes. Why I spoil them .. And strain them like that? He was referring to the lace I was making. Had he ever paid compliments to you before? No. Never. You see, I was a little .. Taken aback but I thought it best to .. Take it lightly and .. I said: well I don't have pretensions to being a raving beauty, you know. But you are, he said. Rather silly. To have to say things like that. Never mind. Please let us have his exact words. Well, he said .. You are beautiful, thank God. What happened then? Well, he just stood and looked me straight in the face and said: Don't you know that I am awfully in love with you? I don't, I said. It meant so little to me that I really had no difficulty in keeping quite cool. So I said I don't think it for a minute. And even if it were true I don't want you to say it to me. I see. Go on. And then he fixed himself another whiskey and soda. And I began to wonder if he hadn't been drinking. So I said to him .. Look here, I think you had .. Better not take any more of that. I was quite friendly about it but he emptied his glass. He put it down and .. Said: do you think I am talking to you like this because I am drunk? He asked me that in a very .. Sort-of abrupt way. And I said, well that is the most .. Obvious explanation, isn't it. I really can't go on. I think it is .. It is so stupid telling you things like this. Never mind. Please let us have his exact words. He said: I have loved you ever since I first knew you. I have held my tongue as long as I could but now it has got to come out. I love you. I love you. I love you. He repeated it. Just like that. And his eyes were all funny. And he said: And I won't go home now. So I lost my temper and I cried: "You poor fool, you. Don't you know that I have never loved anyone but Robert?" And even if I didn't love Robert. That you were the last person in the world that I should care for. So he said: What do I care? Robert is away. Well, that was the last straw. I was simply beside myself. I thought him a filthy swine to talk to me like that because Robert was away. So I said: If you don't leave this very minute I'll call the boys and have you thrown out. And with that he just said: The boys are out of earshot. And he took hold of me and turned me around and I screamed let me go. But he said: not much not much. I have got you now. So then I cried out as loud as I could. Boy, boy! But he held his hand over my mouth. It is all so shameful to tell you all of these things. I know it is very hard. For your own sake I beg you tell us the whole story now. Alright. So he flung his arms around me and began to kiss me. His lips were burning. He was like a madman. He kept on talking and talking. He kept on saying he loved me and that he wanted me and .. He held me so tight that I could hardly breathe. I felt weaker and weaker. At one time I really thought I was going to faint. His breath was so very hot on my face it made me feel .. Desperately ill. And he kissed my face and .. My neck. My hair. My eyes. Suddenly he lifted me right up. And I felt that he was carrying me. I don't know what happened really, but .. He didn't look at me and he didn't say anything and I didn't look at him. But suddenly I could see his face. And it was all white and .. And his eyes were just burning. And he wasn't a man any longer. He was a savage. Then it was .. it flashed across my mind that he was carrying me to my bedroom. Something happened. I don't know what. But he stumbled and fell. And his hold on me loosened. So I dashed around the sofa. He dashed right after me. There was a revolver on the table and I snatched it up. I didn't even know I had fired. But I saw him stagger. Out towards the veranda. And then I saw him fall. And I heard the reports one after the other. I really don't ask you to believe me but I didn't know I was pulling the trigger. Then suddenly I heard a little click. And I realized. That I had .. Fired all of these cartridges. And the gun was empty. He was lying on the floor all in a heap. And I knew he was dead. And that I had killed him. That's all. Prosecutor to take the witness. Mrs Crosby. Is it not true that Mr Hammond at one time .. Was a frequent visitor in your home? Yes. And hadn't those visits .. kept up .. Until the night of the murder? No. He hadn't been into our house for over three months. Just why did he stop coming? Well, my husband and I had .. Heard that he was involved in some sort of scandal with a .. A half-caste Chinese woman and .. And we thought it better that he didn't come along. Did you ever see this woman? Yes, I saw her. Walking in the village. Was she attractive? No. I shouldn't say so. She was rather common and vulgar. All painted up with a lot of bracelets and bangles. You never met this woman or spoke to her? Of course not. The crown rests. This court is adjourned until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. Your wife is a fine woman, Crosby. It's a shame she has to be dragged through all this muck. For a rotter like him. Thanks, old man. Well, Ong? Is that all for the day, sir? - Yes. Thank you, Ong. I will see you later at the office. Very amusing, your assistant. Yes. And very efficient. [ Chinese language ] You have born up wonderfully, darling. Everybody is talking about your iron nerve. Oh Robert, it has been horrible. Without your love and faith I know I'd never have been able to go through it. Well tomorrow will see the end of the whole sorry mess. Yes, my darling. In 24 hours you will be a free woman. Robert, do you think so? - Uhuh. Robert, tell me. Whatever happens you will always love me? No matter what people might say? - What can they possibly say? Oh Robert, don't you know what I have done? They might say I led him on or something like that. Why, there is not a soul in Singapore who is for Hammond. Everybody knows that a woman like you wouldn't do that. Robert, Robert. Robert. When it is over tomorrow. Let's go away from here. Let's never come back. Let's go far, far away. I tell you what. Let's go to London. As a matter of fact I was planning a surprise. You darling. A vacation in London. You see. I have saved a few thousand dollars. - Oh, Robert. Then we could have the most beautiful time, eh? And after that. There is a rubber plantation in Sumatra. A chap I know must sell out cheap. It is our big chance. Yes. Yes, that is our big chance. No more slaving for the company. We'll be .. out for ourselves. Why, in five years we'll be independent for life. Yes, of course we will. - Sorry, sir. But the time is up. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Well? There is a new development in the Crosby case, sir. Something of a delicate and confidential nature. What is it? It has been brought to my attention, sir. That there is a letter in existence from Mrs Crosby to Mr Hammond. Dozens of them probably. Hammond has been a friend of theirs for years. But this letter sir, was written on the night of Mr Hammond's death. It is quite unusual in tone. Where is this letter? Yes. Its tone is as you say, quite unusual. It is inconceivable that Mrs Crosby could have written such a letter. It is not even in Mrs Crosby's handwriting. I know it, sir. But the original is in the possession of a Chinese woman. Who was living in Mr Hammond's house sir. I see. What does she intend to do with it? She places a very high value on it, sir. As evidence. Oh. Just .. What value? Ten thousand dollars. Ten thousand dollars? She is crazy. Mr Crosby would certainly pay it. Rather than having his wife hanged by the neck, sir. Where would Robert Crosby get ten thousand dollars anyway? The Chinese woman has already taken steps to assess herself. That sum is not impossible, sir. Very well, Ong. In the interests of my client I will .. I'll do what I can. Alright, sir. Ah. There are two conditions the Chinese woman has insisted upon, sir. Damn her impudence. What are they? Mrs Crosby must bring the money herself. What? There will be no risk, sir. You and I will go as escorts. Of course. The money must be in cash. Yes. You've thought of everything. Hmm. Well. I have been educated in schools with white men. I have learned much from the books the white man has written, sir. And how about the books .. The Chinese have written? Only one, sir. Confucius. Good afternoon. Damned clever, these Chinese. You know, Robert is just like a child about the house. After tomorrow he says he's taking me far away from this place forever. You know. He wants to go to Sumatra. But before that he's promised to take me to London. Mrs Crosby. I think I should tell you there is in existence a letter .. In your handwriting from you to Hammond. That is impossible. You had better read it for yourself. Why, that is not my handwriting. I know. It is said to be an exact copy of the original. What does it mean? - That is for you to say. But I didn't write the letter. That is a forgery. It would be difficult to prove that. It would be easy to prove that it was genuine. Well if I did write it I have forgotten all about it. I might have written it years ago. It has no date. I noticed there was no date. But if this letter were in the hands of the prosecutor. They would cross-examine your house boy. They'd soon find out if someone took a letter to Hammond the day of his death. I swear I did not write the letter. - Then .. We needn't go into the matter further. But if the person who possesses this letter .. Sees fit to place it in the hands of the prosecution. You will be prepared. What would anyone be inclined to think who read that letter? That you told a deliberate lie. When? - Under oath in court today. Well, I .. I don't think it is so very strange that one little detail escaped my memory. Your memory is reproduced very exactly .. In every particular of your interview with Hammond. It's very strange that you should have forgotten so important a point. That he came to the bungalow on the night of his death at your exact desire. I hadn't forgotten. - Then why didn't you mention it? I was afraid to. I thought if I told you that Hammond had come .. At my invitation, none of you would believe my story. I know that is very stupid and silly but after I had once told you that .. I had no communication with him, I was obliged to stick to it. Perhaps the terms of the letter are not very clear to your recollection? I will read it to you. "Robert will be away for the night." "I absolutely must see you." "I shall expect you at eleven." "I am desperate and if you don't come I won't answer for the consequences." Well. I admit that is all extravagant and emotional but .. I write like that, you know. I must have been very much mistaken. I've always looked upon you as a very reserved and self-possessed woman. After all, Geoffrey wasn't such a distant acquaintance. By the way. Did you call him Geoffrey? But of course. Everyone did. Mrs Crosby. I have got to talk you very, very seriously. This case was comparatively plain sailing. Although Geoffrey Hammond was much liked and on the whole thought highly of. I was prepared to prove that he was the sort of man .. Who might be guilty of the crime. Which, in justification of your act, you accused him of. The fact. That was discovered after his death that he'd been living with a Chinese woman. Robbed him of any sympathy that might be felt for him by all respectable people. I told your husband just now that I was certain of an acquittal. And I wasn't merely telling him that to cheer him up. I do not believe the jury would have left the box. But this letter. Has thrown an entirely different complexion on the case. I don't see what you're driving at. You mustn't expect other people to be stupid. This letter will put them on the track of suspicions .. That thus far have entered nobody's head. I won't tell you what I personally thought when I read it. I am your legal adviser. I shall represent you in court. I take your story as you tell it to me. And I shall conduct your defence according to its terms. I do not wish you to tell me anything but what is necessary to save your neck. I've made such a mess of things, haven't I. I'm sorry. Who has the real letter? The Chinese woman who was living in Hammond's house. Do you think that she will sell it? I don't know if I am prepared to buy it. - What do you mean? I don't think you understand what you are asking me. You are asking me to do something .. That is no different from suborning a witness. You mean to tell me that you can save me and you won't do it? You can't be that cruel. - I am sorry if it sounds cruel. I want to do my best for you, Mrs Crosby. But a lawyer has a duty not only to his client but also to his profession. I put myself in your hands. I know I had no right to ask you to do anything that isn't proper. I am asking more for Robert's sake than for mine. And I think if you knew everything .. You would believe I was deserving of your pity. Poor old Bob. It will nearly kill him. He is so utterly unprepared. He is so kind and so good. I don't think he has ever harmed anyone in all his life. You mean everything in the world to him, don't you. I suppose I do. And I am very grateful for .. The love he has given me. Well, I am going to help you all I can. But don't think I don't know I am doing wrong. I am. I am doing it with my eyes open. This woman. Demands ten thousand dollars. She also demands that you take the money to her. And ask for the letter yourself. I won't do that. - Then. She will turn the letter over to the prosecutors. Can it be arranged that I go? The prosecutor has joined me placing before the judge .. A request you be allowed to spend a night in my house under police custody. I am sure the judge will grant it. We can go from there. Robert has gone back to the plantation. I will advance the money myself tonight. It won't be necessary to show Robert the letter, will it? Don't you want him to see it? No. Well. I'll do all in my power to prevent him from seeing it until after the trial. He will be an important witness. I think it very necessary .. That he be as firmly convinced of your innocence as he is now. And afterwards? Afterwards, I will still do my best for you. Not for me. For Robert. If he loses his faith in me. He loses everything. It's strange that a man can live with a woman for ten years .. And not know the first thing about her. It is rather .. Frightening. I will call for you here later. Has the white woman arrived? No. I will wait for you here. Let's have a snake fight. You want to see snake fight? Yes. How much? It will cost you 25 dollar. 25 dollars? If you want to see something good. Yes. Yeah, come and see them. How much? - Twenty-five. No good. - Hey. I can fix it for you for twenty dollars. Alright. Show me. White woman. She here now. [ Chinese language ] One moment, please. You wish to speak to Li-Ti? - Yes, I do. Sort of. Well, you know who I am. Yes, yes. You know why I am here? - I expected you. I have brought .. - There is no hurry. Sit down. Make yourself at home. Don't be impertinent. I've come here for my letter. Here is your money. Oh yes. It's a very funny letter. Look here. One moment, please. [ Chinese language ] [ Chinese language ] That filthy beast! How dare you let that man in while I am here. Ah, high-up white lady think she is too good Li-Ti's house. Give me my letter directly. Maybe Li-Ti think her house too good for white lady. This horrible place. Why did I ever come here. You come to buy your life. Very well. I did. Let us come to business. It's ten thousand dollars you want, isn't it? Here it is. Here. White lady very proud. But not too proud to share same man with Li-Ti. You horrible Chinese woman, you. Horrible Chinese woman. But not to Mr Hammond. Many love-names he had for me. Shall I tell you some of them? - Stop it please. It cannot be possible he ever touched a vile yellow thing like you. It is possible. That is why you killed Mr Hammond. Here. Take the money. Take it I tell you. Give me my letter. Oh yes. Because he loved Li-Ti. That is why you killed Mr Hammond. - Don't mention his name again. Don't mention his name again, I tell you. Cheat woman. Liar woman. Murder woman! Maybe I not give you back your letter? Maybe I let you hang for killing Mr Hammond. Alright, alright. Just keep the letter. Just keep it. I'd rather hang I think, than .. Hear you mention his name again. Let me out of here. Let me out, I tell you. - But your husband. That husband you cheat so. How they will laugh at him. Yes. All Singapore will laugh. Here. Take it, please. There. Give me the letter. White woman at Chinese woman's feet. They see you play. Prisoner. Rise and look upon the jury. Jurors, rise and look down on the prisoner. Gentlemen, have you reached a verdict? We have. What is that verdict? Not guilty. Order! Order in the court. Leslie, darling. I am so glad for you. It's wonderful. I say Howard, I was never so happy in all my life. Now for the fly in the ointment. What is all this going to cost me? For my personal services. Nothing. - Oh. But there have been some out of pocket expenses I'm afraid will be a bit stiff. I know. You lawyers are all alike. A lot of robbers. How much do these expenses amount to? There was one item. A letter of your wife's I thought we should get hold of. A letter? Yes. Yes. And had that letter not been bought .. and suppressed .. She would never have been acquitted. What do you mean? And you had to pay for that letter? Ten thousand dollars. Ten thousand dollars? That is everything I have in the world. Who has the letter now? Have you got it? - Yes. Where is it? Why do you want to know? I want to see it. I've got no right to show it to you. Is it your money that is buying that letter or mine? I've got to pay ten thousand dollars for that letter and by god I mean to see it. At least I would like to know if I have got my money's worth. Do you know darling, I've that kind of feeling you will be happier than ever. Hmm. Now come along. Now let's celebrate. Robert. Robert. Your cocktail. Oh yes, my cocktail. Now, we must have a toast before we go. Robert. - Huh? One from you. Your wife. - Oh yes. To my wife. Welcome home. Now, come along Howard. We must be going home. Oh no. Not really. Don't go now. Yes, my dear. We are going to leave you two lovebirds together. What a dear. I am sorry you must dash. Goodnight, old man. Thanks, Howard. I will see you out to your car. Well Robert, you have read the letter. - Yes. And I want to know exactly what it means. Robert, it doesn't mean anything. Let's tear it up. I want the truth. - I know. But it doesn't mean anything. I swear to you. I have been so punished. Oh, what does anything matter anyway? We have got our whole lives before us. Let's forget all about it. And let us start over again. Exactly what does it mean? - Don't ask me. I want to know. Don't ask me any more please. I want to know whether you've been my wife .. or just a common whore. Don't say that! I want the truth. You want the truth? Very well. You shall have it. Geoffrey Hammond was my lover. Go on. - He was my lover for years. We were constantly together. Until about a year ago when he began to change. And then. I couldn't believe it as he was everything in the world to me. God. He was my whole life until I heard about that Chinese woman. Then I couldn't believe that. I could not believe he didn't still love me. So I sent for him. You have the letter. So finally he came. I told him that I knew about that Chinese woman. He denied it. I knew he was telling a lie. Finally I made him admit that it was the truth. And then he said to me that if he had to choose between me and the Chinese woman. He would choose her! Oh god, I don't know what happened after that. I went absolutely mad, grabbed the revolver. And I fired at him and I fired and I fired and fired until the gun was empty. And I gave you my name. Worked and slaved for you. I know. I know. I know I have been vile but I have no excuse to offer. And don't forget this. You got me to this filthy godforsaken place and kept me here for seven years. To live among a lot of dirty natives and dowdy .. Planters' wives. With my youth going. Eating my heart out with loneliness. Trying to make a go of it. And I did try. I did try for your sake. And what did I get from you? Nothing. Nothing. Your whole life was just wrapped up in rubber. Rubber? That was my business. - Yes. Working to make money to give you the things you wanted. What I wanted. What I wanted? I am flesh and blood. What I wanted was love, affection .. happiness. You took everything for granted. 0nce you got me out here to this .. Godforsaken place all you thought about was rubber. All that was on your mind was rubber. All day long I was alone. All night I had to listen to you talk of rubber, rubber, rubber. Rubber! Is it any wonder that when a man came along .. And talked to me of love and romance and music .. that I fell into his arms? Well I did. And it is done now. So what are you going to do about it? Nothing. Nothing? Just that. - What do you mean by that? Nothing. You don't mean to say that .. Now that I have told you the truth you expect to go on living with me out here? Yes. Why don't you send me away? - Send you away? You are not going anywhere. There is no money to send you away. You are going to stay here. Right here in this house. With your memories. Ha! So I am to be punished? I am to be punished, am I? - Yes. I am to live here in this house with me memories. Very well. Alright. If you and your smug respectability are going to punish me. And that is to be my punishment. That I am to remain here in this house with my memories. Alright. I will give you something to remember. I, with all my heart and soul still love the man I killed! Ha ha! Take that, will you. With all my heart .. and all my soul. I still love the man I killed. -(s-d)-
