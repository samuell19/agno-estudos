[R&B music playing] Good morning, Gwyneth. Morning, Ms. Scott. -Perfect. -Thank you. Atticus, how did you do on the math test? Aced it, per usual. That’s what I’m talking about! Thanks, Ms. Scott. You’re very welcome. [gasps] Whoa! ♪ I got the feelin’ ♪ ♪ And now I’m believin’ ♪ ♪ In miracles ♪ [jazz horn blowing] [sighs] ♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh... ♪ [woman] Ms. Scott, please report to the principal’s office. Ms. Scott, please report to the principal. [knocks] Principal Meadows? Hi. You wanted to see me? Yes, yes, please have a seat. Oooh! I think this is the first time I’ve ever been called to the principal’s office. And it’s really funny because as a teacher, it’s my first, but as a student, I’ve never been in here. Speaking of students, um, I just want to share how much I absolutely love the kids, and I have huge plans for-- Yeah, Ms. Scott. Oh, sorry, you’re right. I get a double espresso in me and I could just go a hundred miles an hour, just la-da-la-da-da-da. "Miss Chatty to the principal’s office, please." So, um, what did you call me here for? Well, um, Ms. Hartman, the long-time arts instructor you’ve been subbing for, well, she’s returning from sick leave. Oh! Oh... that is great news. She and I can, um... tag team. The two of us, together, teaching the students, to the end of the fourth quarter. I’m sorry, Ms. Scott, as much as we would love to have both of you, she’s been with us for over 20 years. Right. Yeah, no, I get it. Might you have anything else available fulltime? Well, I’m afraid we don’t have any openings as of right now, but I will keep you in mind for the future. And I have total confidence that things will work out for you. Confidence. Right. I was just hoping-- [energetic music playing] [woman] Mr. Griffin, please report to the principal’s office. [girl] Ooh, Mr. Griffin, you’re in trouble! You got sent to the principal’s office? [boy] If you need any help, I got your back, Mr. G. The two of you need to hustle to class. You can’t afford to be late. But, Mr. G, how can we be late to your class? Class now! [students sigh] Great day. Heard you were looking for me. So look, a district rep is supposed to be stopping by sometime in the next week or so. She says we need to talk. So, please, just make sure our students are on their best behavior if you see a well-dressed, corporate-looking woman roaming our hallways in the near future. Consider it done. Look at me, I got you. You don’t have a thing to worry about, okay? Okay. [relaxing R&B music playing] Ha ha ha! Hey there, baby girl. Gimme a hug. Mmm! Get that for ya. -Thanks. -How was your trip? -It wasn’t bad. -Hey, gonna get that. -There you go. -[Kayla] Thank you. Oh, there’s our girl! Hey, Mama. Mwah! [gasps] Oh, ho! How you hangin’, there? I’m fine. Oh... I will be fine. I just needed to get out of the city for a few days so I can clear my mind. Oh, baby, we know how much that job meant to you. -Mm-hmm. -I’m sorry. Yeah. Yeah, now, we got your back. You can stay as long as you need. -Thank you. -Mm-hmm. -Love you. -Okay. I’m just gonna... Oh, Kayla, Service Saturday is tomorrow. Are you up for joining? -Uh... -You know the best way to get your mind off yourself is to provide support to others. -Okay. -So why don’t you go with her? You know what, it sounds like a good idea, Pops. I’ll join ya. I’m just gonna go to my room. Uh... Oh, you mean the playroom, for our grandbabies. [Kayla] Okay. But wait, don’t ya need grandbabies to make that happen? [laughs] I’m just sayin’. [Kayla] Subtle, Dad. ♪ I’ve done hit the road ♪ ♪ Searchin’ high and low ♪ ♪ Never can tell ♪ ♪ You never really know... ♪ Oh, these were so fun growing up. I can’t believe you still show up every weekend. Well, showing up is what we do. Plus, there are some folks in this town that can’t go a week without your mama’s goodies. -I know that’s right. -You know, my heart and my desserts will always be here to support this community. [sighs] This school has not changed a bit. Oh, I cannot believe that Mr. H retired. I loved his class. Made me want to be a teacher. Well, this school and the students could really use more teachers like Mr. H. Okay, how about we just get started, huh? Great job, ladies. Enjoying the scenery? What, the setting up? Yeah. Seems like folks are gonna be arriving soon. So... But we’ve got some time. So, why don’t you, uh, have a look around? I am fine right here, Ma, but thank you. And I can’t promise I’m not gonna eat all of this while you’re gone. [soft R&B music playing] [father humming] -Thank you. -There you go, ladies. You know, I’ve been hearing a lot of good things about those dating apps nowadays. Ooh, I don’t know, Dad. Mom might not like it if you got on an old people meet. -Huh? -But if you happen to see any job openings while you’re online, please let me know. I hear they’re looking for teachers at Stansville. They may even have an opening in the arts program. Got nothing against Stansville, but, uh... I had my heart set on getting approved for my grant in London. Moving back home is definitely not the direction I’d like to go in. Plus, this semester’s nearly over, so... Well, you need a job for your grant, right? -Right. -You got to crawl before you walk, baby girl. Yeah, I’ll consider it. [playful music playing] -What was that? -What was what? -Huh? -That side eye the two of you like to give each other when you’re up to something. What did you do? Okay, I may have talked to the principal at Stansville about your situation. Mom. You have an interview Monday morning. What... what? -Back at my old high school? -Well, you said you were considering it. Yeah, well, that was before I found out you already got me a job interview. Well, who cares what order it happened in? It happened. You have a job interview. -Yay! -Oh! Now, you can thank me later. [Kayla sighs] [school bell rings] No running in the hall, please. [man] We’re gonna discuss this later. -Excuse you. -I am so sorry. You know, we expect so much more out of our students. Did you just arrive? I did, but, uh, also, I, um... -I think I’m gonna leave. -Oh, you can’t leave yet. You haven’t even stepped foot into our classrooms to observe us. -I’ve seen enough. -Wow, that’s so obstinate. -Excuse you? -I mean, I can tell already that you’re making assumptions about us without even being here, for what, five seconds? With all due respect, of course, ma’am. Well, with all due respect, I don’t know you. And I have no idea what you are talking about, so forgive me if I find it ironic that you’re making assumptions about me making assumptions about you. But isn’t it you making assumptions about me making assumptions about you right now? Thank you. No, thank you for reinforcing that I was about to make a big mistake. Huge. I’ll show myself out. Hi! Are you Kayla? We’ll do the interview in the lounge. You know what, actually I was... Interview? You know, I actually went to high school here. Straight-A student, launched a newspaper club. Head of the Yearbook Committee. Your mom talked my ear off about you. Yeah, she’s a blessing and a curse. And I looked over your résumé. Your experience is impressive. And it heartens me that an alum has gone on to do such great things. And as long as you meet the state core curriculum standards, you’d have free rein to make it your own. Think of it as a creative position. And how often do you get full creative control? Not very often. Great. Can you start tomorrow? Oh, uh... [scoffs] I need some time to think things over. -Of course. -Yeah. We’re looking to fill the position ASAP. How’s three seconds? Go with your gut here. The offer expires in 3... Wait, wait, wait. 2... I just, if you... I’ll take it! Welcome aboard. I just have a few questions about resources. Resources? Oh, we’ve got resources. I will provide you with all the assistance you need. Wow! Well, then... I’m sold. Especially on that assistant part you mentioned. -[both] Mm-hmm. -Oh, one more thing. Um, we’re a little analog and old school around here. No pun intended. So your start paperwork, it may feel a little bit like... homework. [Nancy laughs] [Kayla laughs] -Tanya Weldon? -Kayla Scott? Like, when’s the last time we’ve seen each other? Oh, it’s been since high school. Maybe this very classroom, actually. Fourth period science, Mr. Riley. Breeziest class of all time. Oh, for you. I escaped with a C-minus. He had it out for me after I refused to dissect that frog on ethical grounds. Well, we all know frog legs are meant to be battered and deep-fried, not dissected. So, what are you doing here? I just got hired. I’m actually running the arts program. -Really? -Yeah. Well, I mean, for now, at least. I’m also waiting to get approved on a teaching grant in London. I see. Wow, look at us. From high-school besties to now coworkers. Yeah. You’ve always been so good at decorating. Why don’t you decorate a bit in this classroom? It will give the kids a better vibe. Oh, I think my vibe works just fine. I’m focused on teaching, not decorating. Right. Yeah, no, of course. You do you. Well, it was great to see you, um, but I’ve got a lot of work to do. Then I will let you get back to it. I’ll, uh, see you tomorrow. [sighs] [sighs] Good morning. Okay, then. [exhales sharply] [school bell rings] Good morning, students. I am Ms. Scott, your new art teacher. And I have a feeling that we are going to have a lot of fun together this fourth quarter, am I right? [clears throat] Okay. When I call your name, if you could please raise your hand and tell me what type of art you’re interested in. Uh, Eddie. Um, I kind of like painting, I guess. Nice, good to know. Thank you, Eddie. Emma? I mostly like watching movies. -[kids laughing] -Hey, wait a minute. Movies count as a form of art. Anything else? Uh, I used to play the flute, but not anymore, though. Okay, well, maybe we can revisit that later. I actually used to play myself. And Stacy. Oh, here. I like to dance. Okay, well, maybe you could show me some of your moves. [laughs] And Leon. Leon. No? Sorry I’m late. It won’t happen again. -Till tomorrow. -[students laugh] Okay, class, settle down. Leon, what kind of art do you like? I don’t know. Well, then I have good news for you. Because I have created a questionnaire. [students sigh] We got a test on your first day? No, no, not a test. More of an artistic personality assessment. This way we can zero in on your interests, skills and abilities. Now, while you’re filling out the form, I want you to really take time and think about... Who threw that? -[Kayla] Okay, Eddie. -[paper crinkling] Think this is a joke? What’s wrong with you, bro? -I was minding my own business. -[Kayla] You guys, listen up! -Leave me alone. -Class, simmer down. [students laughing, shouting] Class! Okay, calm down. -[students shouting] -Listen up! Calm down! -Hey, hey! -Wait! -Class! -[shouting] Hey, hello! What did I teach you guys about respect? Leon? Treat others how you want to be treated. That’s right. So keep the noise down and put your eyes on your teacher. Ms... Scott. Scott. Apologize to Ms. Scott. [students] Sorry, Ms. Scott. Thank you. I appreciate your help, Mr... Griffin. Jordan Griffin. [softly] Griffin. I got this. I’m sure you do. Just looks like you needed a little help. Well, if I did, I would ask for it. [Jordan] Well, don’t be ashamed. We all need a little help sometimes. Definitely not ashamed, just didn’t need an outside intervention, you know what I mean? I know quite a lot about classroom management. -Hmm. -[Nancy] Wow! It hasn’t been this quiet in here in years. You must be doing something right. Oh, good, I see you’re getting acquainted with your new partner. Have fun running the arts program together, you two. [giggles] Hmm. [chuckles] Hey there, partner. Part-- Part-- No. Um, Nancy said that you’re my assistant. Assistant? I don’t think so. What were her exact words? She clearly said that she was going to provide me with assistance. Assistance or assistant? You know what? How about we look at it like you’re my guide? Not that I need one. You know, I’m really sorry about earlier. Sorry about what? Assuming I was someone else or sorry about interrupting my class? A little of both. I wasn’t trying to step on your toes. I was just trying to help. I know. It’s just, um... I feel like Principal Nancy may have embellished just a little bit when she said that this school was full of resources. I think she just meant you. Well, if she was talking about me, she was underselling. I’ve been a substitute teacher in every department in this school since we’ve been cycling through teachers. Oh. So you’re like a Jack of all trades. Master of one. History. You know, I’m kind of the academic type. Well, I’m kind of the creative type. And I look forward to putting my own touch on this program. [chuckles] You know, that’s really funny. ’Cause the past few art teachers said something very similar to that, and none of them lasted past a few months. [clears throat] I don’t mean to overstep, but I’m overprotective of this school. How about this? I’d rather you underpromise and overdeliver, rather than let them down. I love your passion, I really do. But just trust me. I got this. I have home court advantage. -Oh. -I was a student here, did you know that? No, I didn’t. You know, it’s been some time since you’ve been here. -You’re gonna need my help. -Is that right? Yeah. Yeah, I got a special connection with this group. And you and I know as teachers, having that kind of rapport makes our job easier. Now, I’ll put some special notes in here. -Yes, okay. -In the files. Their strengths, their weak spots, their interests, backgrounds. How about this? We play nice, we work well together, and we give these children the kind of education they deserve. And no more assumptions? The only last assumption I’m going to make is that you and I are going to make a great team. Deal. [playful R&B music playing] So, how was your first week? It’s like we barely even see you since you took the job. It’s like you’re still living in Charlotte. Ha ha, Mom. I know, I’m sorry. These kids require a lot of work. More than my other group. So I have decided to make a vision board. Now I can see each student’s individual needs. Mr. H did something like it in his class. Helps students to not feel like they’re just a number. Well... you learned all that about them in the last few days? Mm-hmm. I mean, with... some help from another teacher, who is partnered with me. Well, that sounds nice. Yeah. Well, remember, you’re a team, okay? Make sure there are equal parts give and take. Yes, Mom. So, how does it feel to be back home? It’s a lot. You know, on one hand, there’s the nostalgia and the fond memories, but then on the other hand, Maple Ridge did not have the kind of classes where you needed to read all of this background material. I mean, it’s... it’s a lot of work, Mama. I just can’t seem to get this grant out of my mind. Just try keeping your head in the same place as your feet. One thing at a time. And your current thing is your students. They need you present. Thank you. Don’t work too hard. Okay. Not like I have a choice. [contemplative music playing] Huh. [Jordan] We do got a new teacher. She seems pretty cool, but you know that’s how they start out at first. I just don’t want these kids to get attached and then feel abandoned if she leaves. You see yourself in them, don’t you? You know what it’s like. And I know firsthand how they’d feel if they get disappointed. She’s there now, isn’t she? I mean, from the sound of it, you act like you wanna do this whole thing on your own. One teacher can’t be everything to every kid. And one good team beats one good teacher every time. Why don’t you give her a chance? We’ll see. [relaxing R&B playing] Good morning. Um... Hey, hope you guys had a good weekend. I thought that I would give our classroom a little refresh, so, find a station that best interests you. In here we create. Now, you will learn that life is by your design. Whatever you dream, whatever you want to do, you now have the tools to refine and explore your own gifts and your talents. Where did all this come from? That’s a great question. Some of it, like my flute over here, came from when I was a kid, discovering my own gifts. Some are from my last school and some I found in storage. Now, we are going to study a new art discipline every week. As well as guest speakers and field trips, starting next week with a trip to the Maroney Theater. Leon, is there a station that you like? Not yet. Just pick one and sit down. You guys forget so easy. Do you remember Mrs. Rosen, Mr. Matthews? Where are they now? Hmm? Not here. Why? Why should we get excited about any of this when you’re just gonna leave? I can already tell that you’re an artist. Huh? You’re expressing yourself. There are seeds of poetry in what you just said. You feel betrayed by these teachers. Let down. It hurts, right? Yeah. -And? -And... art doesn’t always come from a happy place, right? Love songs are about heartbreak, poetry, longing. Every film you’ve ever seen features a character who is suffering with something deep and profound. This is where some of the greatest art comes from. And if you could channel all of that into your craft, you could be the next Angelou. I mean, you could grow up to be the next Picasso. Sorry, um, Picasso is a Spanish artist-- I know who Picasso is. Oh, right. I just find cubism to be overrated. [class laughs softly] All right, then how about, um... the next... what’s his name? Chance the Rapper? Or Common? Their artistic creations provides them an opportunity to express themselves and to give back to the community. You all had a rough go at it, and there is no reason for you to expect anything different from me. Are you willing to have faith and give me a chance? Maybe. I’ll take "maybe." [Kayla] Now, let’s get started. Oh! Hi. Uh, sorry. I was just having a walk. Just walking around, you know, getting my steps in. I have a hall pass, promise. Is everything okay? Principal Nancy got an email from the district. The school board is meeting soon to discuss cutting the arts program. You know, they claim that they don’t have enough resources to support it. What? Okay, class, time to start winding down. Let’s clean up our stations. -Hey, Ms. Weldon? -Hey, Eddie. I’m... I’m still having trouble with the vocab, um... Okay, well, just like we practiced, okay? You can do it, sound it out. "Di... dac... tic." Yes, that’s right, great job. I know you’re frustrated, but us working together is really starting to pay off. You are going to ace that vocabulary test. I’m not giving up on you. So don’t you give up on me, okay? Okay. Bye, Ms. Weldon. Bye. Is creeping up on people like your thing or something? No, I just didn’t want to interrupt. Do you always tutor Eddie after class? Um... Yeah, you know, it’s been tough with his dyslexia, but giving him some of my free time is the least that I can do. I wanted to show you something. -Did Eddie make this? -Yes. I mean, these kids are really, really talented. Which gave me a great idea. I want to throw a showcase at the end of the semester. What do you think about the proceeds from an upcoming Service Saturday going to the arts program? -I think you may be onto something. -Yes! Uh, this weekend is dedicated to the cheer squad, but next weekend can be to help fund your showcase. Thank you! This will help us get new items that we desperately need. [sighs] [energetic music playing] [students clamoring, laughing] Maroney Theater, here we come! [cheering] [scatting "I Love Your Smile"] [singing high notes] [gasps] Is that... What do you Gen-Z’s know about ’90s R&B? Yeah, that’s our generation. Man, everybody knows Shanice. Music transcends time. -Wait, do you know her? -Sure do. She was my mentor in Performing Arts Camp several years ago when we were growing up. ♪ Sitting in my class ♪ ♪ Just drifting away ♪ ♪ Staring into the windows ♪ ♪ Of the world ♪ -Yeah! -Whoo! All right! Wait a minute, is that who I think it is? Girl, get down here. [laughing] Look at you all grown up. [laughing] -Oh, my... -Good to see you! Oh, it’s so good to see you! It’s been a hot minute. I know. Dude, she can help us out. [Shanice] ...we need to connect after all these years being on the road. -Yes! And look at us now. -Yes! Back at the Maroney Theater together where it all began. -Yep, this is a special place. -Mm-hmm. Oh, uh, speaking of special, this is Mr. Jordan Griffin. -It is a pleasure. -Hey. [Kayla] And these are my students. [Shanice] Hello! You know, all the time Kayla and I spent here taught me the importance of hard work and dedication. And without that, I don’t think I’d be where I am today. Is it enough to just be talented? Boy, everybody’s talented. But not everyone puts in the work. -I know that’s right. -[laughs] [Shanice] Look, I don’t care about your circumstances, like, you can do anything you put your mind to. Singing helps me find my place in the world, but it’s not just about singing. You know, there’s dancing and painting... Or spoken word. Yeah, even spoken word. I want to be where you are one day. [Shanice] And you can be. The key is, you just have to work hard and listen to your teacher. That’s right. [laughter] Now, it was so nice meeting you future artists, but I have to get back to my rehearsal. -Oh! -You don’t have to rehearse. Your voice is fire. Look, if you don’t rehearse, you’ll never be great, and if you don’t keep rehearsing, you’ll never stay great. [Eddie] We’re having a showcase to save our art class. Would you be able to come? Hold on now, Eddie, we don’t even have a location for that yet. -I don’t see why you can’t have your showcase here. -Wait, really? Yeah, I can pull some strings. -What? -Yeah. Yes! Thank you! [Jordan] I stand corrected. We have a showcase to prepare for. [cheering] Shanice, can we please take a picture before we go? Let’s do it, no problem, come on. [Jordan] Let’s do it, now. Come on, come on, come on down. Come on down. "Art is life" on three. 1, 2... 3! [all] Art is life! -[camera shutter clicks] -[upbeat music playing] Who can tell me about hope in Claude McKay’s "If We Must Die"? Amy? Stacy. Um, it’s about sticking together no matter how hard things are? Very good, and what was the structure of this poem? Leon. Okay. The work created by poets, it can make us feel deeply. Why? Because they know and love the English language. Regardless if they’re writing a sonnet or a bar. Speaking of bars, how about we talk about an artist who you might be a little bit more familiar with? Didn’t think I was cool, huh? [soft laughter] Oh, since we’re on the subject of spoken word, Emma! Is there something you would like to share out loud with the class? Oh, come on, don’t be shy. Share. Let’s give her a little encouragement. [students chanting "Emma!"] [chanting stops] "I have a question. "I’m nervous, not calm. The idea to ask you came from my mom." -Whoo! -[laughter] [school bell rings] That’s class. [Leon] You didn’t spoil it, did you? You said to tell her to meet you here at lunch, and that’s exactly what I told her. What’s this about? I’m gonna ask Emma to prom. But I’m not comfortable doing this type of thing in front of people. So... I’m gonna do it my own way. Hey! -Oh, okay! -Yeah. Well, thank you for my prom prep lunch invite. -What’s going on? -The reason why I brought you down here is because I wanted to get your professional opinion about something. Okay. [pops lips] What can I do for you? Well, you know how much I love this school, right? -Mm-hmm. -And I really, really want to give these students a special prom. You really care about these kids like they’re your own. Yeah. You know, I come from a long line of teachers and, you know, this is not just a job for me. It’s a calling. Yeah, I mean, teachers can... they can change a life. I had this one very dedicated, amazing teacher who always inspired me to fight for my dreams and to keep climbing to bigger, better things. I mean, do you ever think you might be, like, overlooking something that could be right in front of you, something special because we’re always constantly looking forward? Um, I mean, I don’t see anything wrong with always wanting to strive for more. Not like that. I’m just saying that, that thing, you know, that we’re looking for could sometimes be right in front of you. The students. I mean, sticking with them through thick and thin is fulfilling. -Yeah. -Like Mark Thackeray. Pfft. Definitely like Mark. Yeah. Mark who? -Mark Thackeray. -Thackeray. Sidney Poitier, To Sir with Love. -He played the teacher. -He sure did. Oh, wait, hold up, you never saw that movie. Okay, first of all, that is a film from our grandparents’ generation. I’ll get around to seeing it. Yeah, well, maybe we could do it sooner than later. In class, that is. You know, movie Fridays. Movie Fridays. Yes. Okay, so... Prom theme, what are you thinking? Oh, so... I was thinking... let’s take ’em to the islands, eh? All right, mon. ...in a crowd. My mind is made up. Insecurity won’t stand between you and... me. [exhales sharply] Emma. Even in a crowd, your face is the only face I see. This day is a new chance. Say the word and we’ll have this dance, prom queen, whose beauty is already your crown. Will you be joined by a king? [students giggle] Wh... Wh... -What do you think? -Uh, um... I’ll think about it. [laughing] Ooh, and... big blue balloons to represent the ocean waves, right? -Yes! -[gasps] And most importantly... [island music playing] Music. -Yeah. Art is about vision. -Yes. So envision it with me, eh? White sands, sipping coconuts. Yes! The palm trees. -[laughing] -The island breeze. Okay. I see you have some moves. I’m probably a little rusty. I think you are so fine. Um, I mean, um... I think that you are doing just fine. You know what I mean. [Leon] What did you say to me? Back up, this ain’t a joke! What did you say to me? Hey, hey, hey, break it up! -What’s going on? -I wasn’t going to hit him. I was just doing my performance, about to ask Emma to prom, until they came in and ruined it, and then this fool started clownin’ me. Hey, calm down, you hear me? Now, what have I taught you guys about having respect? Hmm? Haven’t I taught all of you about keeping your control over your mind and your actions? Breathe. Breathe. Let’s go. Let’s go to the principal’s office. Let’s go. Come here. Jay. Okay, come on, off to class. Let’s go, show’s over. [peaceful music playing] Oh... Jordan. -Hey. -How’s Leon? Oh, he’s fine. You know, with these students, it could have been a lot worse. I’m just glad things didn’t get out of hand. Yeah, me too. Seems like the field trip definitely inspired him. That kid showed confidence. -Yeah. -Thank you again for supporting me. Oh, of course, we’re a team. Yeah, ’cause, you know, -I’m the coach and you’re the assistant. -Right, right, right. Okay, Coach, I’m gonna head over to Principal Nancy’s office. She wants me to talk to the rest of the students about the incident. -Okay. -I will see you later. Yes, you will. [contemplative music playing] [flute playing] [plays wrong note] Oh. I didn’t know anyone was in here. That’s okay. Please, keep playing. I don’t wanna look silly. [scoffs] You don’t look silly. Here. [blowing breathy notes] [Emma laughs] It’s been a while for me too. When did you get your flute? It was my mom’s. I decided to try it again after what you said, but... I’m not very good. I just... I wanted to be good like her. Do you remember what Shanice said? It’s not gonna happen overnight. Don’t give up. Don’t get discouraged if you get a little squeaky here and there. I know it is not easy. But you are so brave for even trying. You’re doing wonderfully. She was teaching me Swan Lake before she got sick. Okay. But we never finished this part. All right. Then how about... we pick up where you both left off? Yeah? Okay. [clears throat] [playing "Swan Theme"] Hi, this is Kayla Scott. Yeah, I saw I missed a call from the school. Perhaps from Principal Meadows in regards to an opportunity to-- uh, wish you a happy birthday. Okay, love you, Dad. All right, bye. [father chuckles] Okay, now I’m going to have to explain that later. Oh, that’s going to take some explaining now. No! I thought you were someone else. What are you doing here? I’m just dropping off some presents. The church had a supply drive for you and the kids, and let’s see, I have a music book, I have, uh, paints and brushes, and, uh... anything you need. Wait a minute, they did this for us? Mm-hmm. You know the village always comes through. -I know that’s right. -Right on. -[laughs] -Well, I can’t wait to tell Jordan and the kids. Jordan? Is that the guy your mother told me about from the Service Saturday? Dad, it is not like that. Uh-huh. Uh, listen. Now, I don’t want you to rush into anything because of me and my grandbabies. Just take your time. I just want you to be as happy as your mother and I. Thanks, Dad. Oh! Speaking of kids, my class is about to begin. -Oh. -I love you. -You want me this way. -Exactly. Love you. [laughs] Hey, I don’t mean to barge in, but I’m looking for Leon. He wasn’t in my class this morning. Have you seen him? And, uh, looks like he’s not in here either. Ooh. You don’t think he’s still upset about that note? I’m not sure, but I’m gonna go check on it. Can you do me a favor and go in my classroom, make sure that my students are working on their assignments, please? -Yeah. -Thank you. -You’re welcome. [peaceful music playing] Leon, did you forget about school today? No, Mr. Griffin. What’s going on? Hmm? Hey. Go. Go finish playing, okay? Where is your mom? She can’t miss her shift. And daycare won’t take Kianna because she has a cold. So you have to take care of your sister every time your mom doesn’t have child care? Hey, hey. It’s okay. My mom is doing everything she can, and I didn’t want you or anyone else to think any different. You know, you stepping up and taking care of your sister, helping out your mom, I can get behind that. But I need you to know that this is not your responsibility. You think your mom might be open to allowing someone else to take care of your sister? No, no, no. You know, somebody that could be there for her any time she needs her, somebody that has a history of teaching children his whole life. No, I... You’ve got too much on your plate. I don’t wanna be a burden. Not me. It’s Mr. H. Now, Mr. H, everybody knows him in this town. Come to think about it, I think he even taught your mom. What do you say, huh? Really? Give her a call? [Leon crying] Hey, come on. Come on. [Kayla] Yeah, um, listen. I was wondering if we could clear the air. I’m not exactly sure what you mean. Well, I, um... I feel like there’s been a little bit of a distance between us. Did I do something wrong? I don’t know, Kayla. I guess it just didn’t sit well with me that moments after accepting your job offer here, you were already talking about what’s next for you. Like this school and these kids are just another stepping stone for your grants. Tanya, I hope you know that I did not mean it that way. Whether you did or you didn’t, it felt like you wanted to be anywhere but here. Stansville is my home, my community. Maybe you need something different, but everything I need is here. No, I wish I had that. Kayla, you do. You have roots. A home, people... traditions. And friends. You know what, you’re right. I’ve just been so caught up in this vision that I’ve had for my life that... I guess I took what I already have here for granted. You know, maybe that’s not all there is. Maybe... maybe I want something new. Wow! I think that’s the first time I’ve ever said that out loud. [Tanya laughs] It feels... Oh, liberating? Uh, and, uh, very uncomfortable. [Tanya laughs] I am so sorry. Thank you for this. I’m sorry too. I should have spoken up about what was wrong with me. How about you speak into a balloon? You know, but it goes so well with your outfit. I think it’s yours, yeah. You can do it. Hah! Still got it. -[laughing] -Still got it. [laughing] It looks like the two of you are besties again, huh? -Hmm. -Okay. [Tanya] Who is that? I think that’s the district rep here to talk to Principal Nancy about the program. She did not look happy. No, she does not. [Nancy] Thank you for coming by. I’m available to answer all of your questions. Can I offer you some delicious sweets? I don’t mean to be the bad guy, you know that, but seeing as how Stansville High’s test scores are... -[Nancy] They’re improving. -[woman] Not fast enough. I don’t know if the other board members and I can justify more money for extracurriculars when academics should be first priority. Kayla! Jordan. In my office now. [both] Yes, Principal Nancy. Kayla Scott. Jordan Griffin. Maybe it’s best if they tell you about their progress, personally. I can say firsthand that, the students around here, they have been making a lot of headway. And we have a personal connection with these kids. And we are tuned in to their needs. And they need more funding, not less. Exactly. They could have more funding for academics if we cut the arts. The board will be making the cuts official in two weeks. Wait, wait. So that... that’s it? Because I can give you evidence of measurable progress. You know, I have, uh, numbers and statistics that will show you the arts program... it actually improves the students’ academics. Look, if you can provide data to back up your claims, I’ll call a special committee meeting next week and we’ll hear you out. Have a nice weekend. I’ll show you out. Thank you. -[sighs] -How do you have that information? I don’t. Uh, not yet, at least, but gimme some time and I will put something together. I just... I don’t even know where to begin. Maybe that’s the problem. I don’t, we do. You free for dinner tonight? [peaceful music playing] Jordan? Uh, excuse me? Is that you? -It couldn’t be! -[Kayla laughs] -Kayla Scott! -Mr. H! -What? -Let me get that. Thank you. -Oh, my. -What a surprise. [Mr. H laughs] Wait, what are you doing here? Wait, how do the two of you know each other? How do the two of you know each other? [chuckles] Kayla, Jordan is my nephew. Jordan, Kayla’s one of my favorite students. Well, there goes my grand introduction. Jordan was telling me all about this new teacher at school. I can’t believe he was talking about you this whole time. And the way he talks about you, you’d think he might have a little crush-- You wanna say grace, Unc? [Mr. H, chuckling] Okay. How about I say it so I can pray that you don’t further embarrass me? Thank you, God, for this food that you’ve provided. And we ask for you to pray over us as we spend our time together. -Amen. -Amen! -That was very nice, Jordan. -Jordan did well. Have an attitude of gratitude. Especially for good food. You know, I need to put some of your quotes on posters in my classroom. You’re back at Stansville, full circle. -Yes. -I hear it’s not all sunshine and roses there these days. That is an understatement. I don’t even know if my job is going to exist next year. I do not like not having control over what happens with me next, you know? [Mr. H] Well... you may not have much control over what happens next, but you can control how much love you give your students while you have them. That will stick with them their whole life. More than... what, lessons, projects or programs themselves. It’s all about love... and community. [humming] Hey, Mama. Your sous-chef has arrived. Hey, baby, you ready to do this? -I was born ready. -That’s my girl. There’s a rolling pin with your name on it. Ahh! All right. So... how’s the showcase planning coming along? We might not have an art showcase to support soon. Next week there’s a meeting where I have to convince an entire board not to cut the funding. I hope all of this makes a difference. Oh, my girl, of course it makes a difference. And you have already made such a difference. I talked to Eddie’s grandmother and she says she hasn’t ever seen him so excited about something. I’ve seen the same thing in such a short time. You know, my focus is to make sure that these kids get the opportunity to find the artist within and not have that chance ripped from under them because of funding. While I’m here, Mom, I owe it to those kids to give them all of my... everything. No one can say you’re not giving it your all. Now, what I do know is that everything happens for a reason. And if anyone can save this art program, it’s you. [laughs] Now, come on. These last pies won’t bake themselves. Okay. -Hey. -Hey. What’s up? Well, I promised the board members their statistics next week, so I’m gonna deliver. Mm-hmm. Well, I would offer you a helping hand, but I don’t think you need an assistant. Got something for you. It’ll help take your mind off of everything. Passing notes, Mr. Griffin? Yeah. No, I picked up something off of Leon. Aha. "To Sir, with Love." Yeah. There’s a new backyard cinema that’s doing a series of movies dedicated to Sidney Poitier. -Ah. -Yeah, and they’re showing that one tomorrow. So, is this like a...? It’s written right there on the invite. [Kayla sighs] I’ll see you later. [romantic R&B playing] Wow! [Jordan] Mm-hmm. It’s pretty perfect. Yeah, well, I spent a long time on it. -Thank you. -You’re welcome. So, I wanted to talk to you about tomorrow’s meeting. Whoa! No work. I just want you to relax... and enjoy the space, and I want you to feast your eyes on the incomparable Sidney Poitier in one of his most career-defining roles. So, is this like a date? Yeah. A date. Showtime. [Jazz music playing] [Jazz music playing] [Kayla] It’s just... so many lessons packed in one film. Forgiveness, discipline, respect, integrity... Mm-hmm. Integrity and men are few and far between these days. Oh, I think that there is a few left. [phone buzzes] Sorry. Oh! Wow. What? Is everything okay? Yeah, no, it’s, um... the principal from Maple Ridge, I think it might be about a job. Oh, you seem excited. Not excitement, just... surprise. You miss it there? -Jordan-- -No. It’s okay. [scoffs] You know that I’m in a tough position. This... was a very lovely evening. And you are a perfect gentleman. But I, um... Well, good luck fighting for us tomorrow, Kayla. Yeah. Thank you, Principal Nancy. And to all of our wonderful teachers for showing up to support. And to the board. I really appreciate you making time to hear me out. Studies show that students with consistent arts education produce higher math and English test scores, which correlates with higher rates of graduation and college enrolment. Since my team and I revamped the arts program, attendance is up. One of our students with dyslexia went from the near bottom of the class to the very top. Another student, who had frequent absences, has completely turned things around. Now these are just two of our student success stories from a long list. While this is impressive and may show a correlation, it’s not quite the type of long-term data we’re looking for. Right, but that data comes with time. And it will come. I mean, we are just getting started. Can you give the program one more year? Thank you, Ms. Scott, that will be all for today. Wait. Jordan? This school system has failed us. I have seen teachers come and go time and time again. But this semester, something has changed. And that something is not quantifiable. I... would love to invite you to our art showcase at the Maroney Theater this Friday. That way you could see our students face to face, you know, see their abilities, their talents, and not just look at them as numbers or statistics. Thank you, both. We’ll consider these your closing remarks and a decision will be forthcoming. Meeting adjourned. [ringtone chiming] -Hello? -Yeah, Ms. Scott. This is Principal Meadows. We have a position opening up next year if you’re interested. It’s fulltime, excellent benefits, competitive salary. Wow! That is such a generous offer. You should know that I’m really going to bat for you, so, we have many other outstanding candidates, in consideration, but you are first on my list. So I’ll need an answer by Friday. Thank you. Well, we’re pretty much all set up for the showcase tomorrow night. You feelin’ ready? Daydreaming about Jordan? -What? -[chuckles] I knew that would get your attention. -[Kayla chuckles] -What’s on your mind? A million things. I mean, the showcase, the board’s looming decision, my new job offer-- You got a job offer? Yeah. At my old school. And they need an answer by tomorrow night, and I have no idea what I’m going to tell them. Now, if this were a few weeks ago, would have been a no-brainer. But now... now I’ve really grown to love the students and the staff. And I finally feel at home in Stansville again. But it’s also looking like there may not be a place for you here anymore. Exactly. Have you told Jordan and the kids yet? No, not yet. I just, um... They’ve worked so hard for this moment, I think it should just be about them and them only. Yeah. That’s gotta be tough. Mm-hmm. I’m here for you. [Kayla sighs] -What do you say we get out of here? -Yes! -Yeah. Big day tomorrow. -Oh, yes. [upbeat music playing] [Kayla] All right. Tonight is the big night, and I am so proud of each and every one of you. And no one... no school board member, no person in power, whether it be in education or in life, can take away your talent, your drive, or your passion. Remember what you learned in my class. Life is by your design. And I can say with absolute certainty that each and every one of you... are true talent. You’re artists. Ms. Scott, we got you something. [Kayla] What? What is this? Um, we wanted to show our appreciation for everything that you’ve done for us. [Kayla sighs] I know it’s not much, but... No... It’s perfect. Thank you. No, thank you. Thank you for... giving us a chance, Ms. Scott. All right! We have a show to do. -Yeah, yeah. -[laughter] And you all are going to knock the socks off of every student, teacher, and parent out there tonight, am I right? Now, let’s go and give them everything we’ve got. [laughter] Let’s go! [upbeat music playing] [ringtone chimes] Nervous? [scoffs] Of course. You’re not? Nope. Of course I am, I just hide it better than you. [applause] Good evening. Thank you all for coming tonight. We are going to have a marvelous show. Please welcome our fearless leader of the arts program, Ms. Kayla Scott! [applause] Thank you, Principal Nancy, for that lovely introduction and for bringing me back to the Stansville family. First, allow me to introduce my other team members, Jordan Griffin and Tanya Weldon! [applause] I tell you, I am so blessed to have had these two by my side this semester. None of this would have happened without you. So thank you. [sighs] Okay. This semester, we focused on creative expression. The students learned how to harness their passion and their emotions and pour it into their crafts. And we know that you all are going to love it! So, enjoy the show! [fanfare playing] [Leon] What is art? [playing "Swan Theme" with band] Art is... expression. Emotion. Love. Art is perspective. Art can take you on a journey and bring you back home to a blank space that becomes more familiar in an hour, releasing your heart and soul with words that have power. Art is dance. It can be improvised or strategized, symbolic or aesthetic. Art combines rhythm and sound to create a line that is melodic, transcends time, space and culture. Art speaks to us, through brushes, pencils, spray cans. It can take a blank canvas and turn it into Mona Lisa or a soup can. Images through abstraction can be described by one’s reaction. And most of all, art is necessary. It is my right to see the beauty and ugly of the world different than how you see it. Each one of us are showing each one of you our world. See? [upbeat music playing] [cheering] -I’m so proud! -Thank you, Mom. -Ooh! -Congratulations, baby girl! -That was good! -Oh, I appreciate that. Oh, I will be right back. Okay. -Hi. -Great show tonight, Kayla. -Thank you. -I was so impressed watching your presentation on livestream, and tonight moved me even more. I really appreciate that. And I’m just so happy that you both came out. -Wait, how do you two know each other? -We met right before the show. Pam and Principal Nancy filled me in on your situation. And we want to fund your arts program for next year. And that will give us time to figure out how to invest in it continuously beginning the following year. -Wait, what... -But how are you going to convince the rest of the board? -Yeah. -They act pretty tough in the boardroom, but I like to think that I have some influence. I’m convinced, I’m convinced. -Great! -Oh. -Congratulations. -Thank you! And if there’s anything else I can do for you, Kayla, let me know, I mean it. You’re amazing. -I gotta go. Bye. -Okay. Thank you. [screaming] Did you hear that... What? I’m assuming it’s paid off? Yeah. It did. Great show, Ms. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Griffin. I got the money. [relaxing R&B playing] I just wanted to ask you one more time. -Yes? -Are you sure about your decision for next year? [Kayla] I have given this a lot of thought, and I’ve weighed all my options. I’m sure. [Nancy] When do you head to Charlotte? Later today, actually. Hey, hold on. Hold on a second, Tanya. Have you heard anything about Kayla taking on another job? You mean the job offer she got in Charlotte? She said she was gonna tell you after the showcase. And I just blew it, didn’t I? [Jordan] Why didn’t you tell me? I thought you was committed to staying. I overheard your conversation with Principal Nancy. You’re going to Charlotte for another job? You’re gonna abandon these students, you’re gonna abandon this school? After everything we just went through. We just got the arts program back! You know, these kids, they... they trusted you. I trusted you. I feel so foolish, thinking that you were different, but it turns out, you’re just like everyone else. Are you done? Yeah. I think I am. Thank you. You made the right decision, you know. I’d be lying if I didn’t question it after what happened with Jordan. -It was a misunderstanding. -Yeah, but it didn’t have to be. I mean, he could have let me speak, but he didn’t. You’re not totally innocent, either. You should have told him about your offer. How could I? He’d completely discounted everything I’ve done this whole semester in a single minute. -Are you surprised? -[scoffs] At those teachers’ desks at that school, there might as well be revolving doors. He’s probably getting used to being left all the time. Just like those kids. Yes, but that does not give him the right to come for me based off of what someone else did. Well, what he did wasn’t right. -He was loud, and he was wrong. -Yep. Thank you. But why are you so quick to cut him off? Any chance you might be looking for a reason to put some distance between you two? Fear of getting hurt? Or maybe... fear that it might work out. [peaceful music playing] I just don’t know what got into me. You were acting the fool, huh? -I am a fool. -Check. I won’t fight you too hard on that one. Should have just talked to her, I should have listened to her. I always told my kids, it’s always better to listen than just to talk. You can’t learn nothin’ if you’re talkin’. Jacked everything up, Unc. When it comes to being in a relationship with each other, it’s best to be in the moment. But the second best thing... is right now. Checkmate. You know what, Unc? You’re right. And that’s no surprise. -[laughs] I gotta go. -All right. Hey, Mrs. Scott. Jordan, what are you doing here? Is Kayla around? I need to see her. I’m sorry, you just missed her. She is in Charlotte. I see. Well... thanks anyway. ♪ You don’t feel the same ♪ ♪ Wonderin’ when it changed... ♪ [dance music playing] -Hey, Mrs. Weldon. -Hey! Is Ms. Scott here yet? Um, I think she’s running just a little bit late, but why don’t you help yourself to some food and snacks in the meantime? Hey. Hey. Still nothing? [sighs] Nothing. You know, I keep calling. I really blew this one. ♪ I missed your sexy smile ♪ ♪ Looking forward to seeing you ♪ ♪ I hope I won’t lose control... ♪ Not necessarily. Ms. Scott? We thought you left! I wouldn’t miss it. -You look gorgeous. -Thank you. Jordan. You look stunning. You know, I really gotta tell you that... I was so out of pocket before. I was a idiot. I’m sorry. Look, if you want to leave and take on another job, I completely support that. I was just afraid of losing you. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, it’s time for our sweetheart dance. So grab your partner. Hold that, hold that thought. Ms. Scott, would you mind if I perform my art piece? [relaxing island music playing] You see, I know why I’m here, and that’s where my attention is. I haven’t showed her, but she’s gonna know what my intention is. You see, teaching these students how to thrive in life is where our deep connection is. Sunshine... of the soul is where her true reflection is. Hey, Kayla Scott! Guess what my heart’s desire is. You know, I really don’t care about what perfection is, I just wanna know what our direction is. Well? Do I at least get an A for effort? You are something else, you know that? I’ll take that as a compliment. I should have told you about the job offer. I am learning to be better at communicating the tough stuff. Like, uh... my grant in London got approved. Oh. That’s great news. Congratulations. Thank you. Thing is, there’s a summer program and I leave in a week. But... I will be right back in Stansville next semester. I even found my own place... that’s not my old bedroom in my parents’ house. Wow. Looks like Emma finally said yes. Yeah. She’s not the only one open to... romance. Would you like to dance, Ms. Scott? Oh, nothing too fast. I’m way too old for that sort of thing. [Jordan chuckles] Quoting To Sir, with Love. I’m very impressed. Actually, I heard that they’ll be screening Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner at that cute backyard movie theater we went to. -Oh! -Maybe you wanna go before I leave. Really? Well, you know, that depends. -I have to talk to the manager. -Right. Are you asking me out on a date? [clicks tongue] What would you say? Yes, no? Maybe? [students] Ooooh! Whoa! Hey!
