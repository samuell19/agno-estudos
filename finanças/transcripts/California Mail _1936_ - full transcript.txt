Ripped, corrected & synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! - Hi, Tolliver. - Hello, Banton. - Hello, Mary. - Hello, Roy. I'll help. Thank you. - How are things at the ranch? - Just fine. Are you in town for the day? - Yes, we are. - That's fine. I'm taking a ride out to Oakville after dinner. Would you like to come along? Oh, thanks, Roy, I'd love to but I'm going over to see Munros. They're, uh, christening the baby this afternoon. It's Bill! He's riding bareback. Something must've happened. You know, there's somethin' about a Pony Express rider that sure does take with the gals. Now, listen, just because you're my brother don't try to rub it in. Hello, dad. I didn't expect to see you back so soon. Just got in this mornin'. Looks like you had a little trouble. - Oh, I did. - Indians? Yeah, same old spot about four miles west of Triple Creek. Shot my horse out from under me. Sure glad I wasn't ridin' Smokey. Bill, what happened? Where's your saddle? Oh, I lent it to some Indians. Listen, you're not fooling me. I know what happened. Mary, what are you worried about? I'm here. Yes, I know. What I'm worried about is that sometime you won't be here. Oh, there's no danger. Didn't you ever fight Indians? Oh, you're hopeless. You're coming out to supper tonight? You too, Mr. Harkins? - Yes, indeed. I am. - Oh, that's fine. Well, I'll be looking for you around 6:00. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Come on in, Bill. I got somethin' I want to talk over with you. Dad, what's on your mind? Bill...it's come. What? Post office won't renew our contract. Well...somebody's gotta carry the mail. Yeah, but the Pony Express is through in this territory. They're gonna let mail contracts to stagecoach lines. Well, it was fun while it lasted. When does our contract expire? About two weeks. I guess I better start lookin' around for a job. Bill, I think you and me ought to get in on that stagecoach thing. We've got no stagecoaches. We can buy 'em. Now, here's the idea. They're going to open bids of stage companies in Dodge City on the 15th. I want you to be there 'with a bid for the Harkins' Stagelines.' - Do you mean it? - Of course, I mean it. Maybe a lot of other bids for this territory but I think we can meet any of 'em. Sure, we can. I'll show you some figures tonight. After supper. Gee, Mary, I sure enjoyed that supper. I'm glad you liked it, Bill. What a night! Well, looks like we have a chaperone. Well, Smoke, old boy, looks like we're headin' for Dodge City in the mornin'. It'd be kinda nice if a certain young lady would say yes to a prominent young stagecoach owner, wouldn't it? Sunny, does he look like the businessman type? She's thinking Roy Banton, Sunny. Why pick on poor Roy? I think he's very nice. Oh, you do? I think Roy's an up and coming young businessman. Yeah, I admit that I like the adventure and the excitement of the old days. It sorta kept a man on his toes. But I mean to settle down now. 'And if I do, may I ask you a question?' Perhaps you'd better wait till you do settle down. Alright, my mind's made up. I'm startin' right now. I'm settled down. - How about that question? - Wait a minute. Let me look at you. - What's the matter? - I don't see any difference. You don't? You just keep your eye on me. Don't worry. I'll keep both eyes on you. Well, Sam, I hope you get that contract. Thanks, we'll do our darndest. Let me know how you come out, will you? I certainly will. - Well, goodnight, Dan. - Goodnight. - Good luck. - Thanks. And I wanna be your first passenger. I hate to interrupt you young folks but, Bill, you've got a hard day tomorrow. - Alright, dad. - Goodnight, Mary. Goodnight, Mr. Harkins. - Goodbye, Mary. - Goodbye. I'll see you as soon as I get back. Fine. Gentlemen, we have three bids on the Gold Creek district so similar that we cannot choose between them. That's, uh, the Banton brothers. Henry Ferguson, Samuel, and William Harkins. Now, uh.. ...we will have to award this contract in rather an unusual way. Maybe we could shade our bid a little. Wait a minute, Banton. There's three of us-- Gentlemen, the bids are in. Now, there's a particularly hazardous stretch of country in the Gold Creek district. 'Now, before the post office department' 'will award this contract, they must be sure' 'that that particular part of the country' 'can be safely traveled.' 'So, on the day of July, the fourth..' '...we will have a match race between the competitors.' And go over this particularly hazardous part of the country which I refer to and back. A distance of about, uh, 30 miles. - That's agreeable to me. - And, uh, you, Mr. Ferguson? Well, it, uh, seems about the only way to settle it. Well, I guess, we'll have to be satisfied. May the best man win. And I'll be there to judge the competition. - Thank you. - Good luck. - Good luck. - Thanks a lot. Good luck to you. Are you starting back today, Bill? No, I've got some business in town. I probably won't get out until tomorrow and I think I'll ride Smokey over the course 'so I'll be used to it.' - Well, uh, good luck. - Thanks. Same to you. - That goes for everybody. - Sure. The postmaster said it, "May the best man win." Goodbye, boys. See you later. You got somethin' on your mind. What is it? It's just this.. It ain't gonna be hard to beat Hank Ferguson. But that Bill Harkins.. ...I don't think he ought to drive that race. I guess that could be arranged. I reckon that ain't the only reason you want to get rid of him, is it? What do you mean? Well, there's a girl named Mary that-- Bart! That's my business. The other...that's our business. That's him alright. Get set, boys. Now, Bud's a chance to show how fast you really are. Quick as a cat. Looks like one of us was a good shot. Yup. That's the end of handsome Bill Harkins. Now, if we could just do somethin' about Hank Ferguson we could call the whole thing off and go fish. I'm not worried about Hank. That was my trouble. If you had red hair and was a little taller you might stand a chance with Mary. If you could keep your mouth shut you might amount to something. Well, Smoke, old boy, it looks like our luck still holds good. Hello, Bill. How was Dodge City? Hello, boys. Look after Smoke, will you, Jack? Hello, son. Looks like you've been ridin' hard. - What delayed you? - Oh, little Indian skirmish. Come on inside and I'll tell you all about it. They weren't Indians, dad. They were road agents. They didn't try to rob me, they apparently wanted to get rid of me because they started firing as soon as I got in sight. Could you recognize any of 'em? No, they were all masked. But I did notice that one of them was riding a black horse with white stockings that stood out from the rest. Did you ever see one around here like that? No, don't think I have. But a horse with markings like that shouldn't be hard to find. You're right, dad, that's exactly what I'm gonna try to do. Roy, I did see Bill Harkins ridin' up to his hatch. You're crazy. Well, maybe I am but I've seen him just the same. He's on that palomino horse he has too. That Pony Express rider sure have a way of gettin' out of trouble. Well, he'll be at the dance. I'll fix that red head, so he won't be able to get out of bed, let alone drive a race. Well, I hope so or I'll have to put my mind to work and take care of it myself. 'All balance to your right.' 'Balance to your partners and do-si.' Wait a minute, boys, wait, you can't go in there until you check your gun. Balance to your partners and go swing. 'Balance to your opposite partner and go swing.' 'Balance to your opposite partners and swing.' 'Now, look to your opposite partners and swing' 'and everybody join in this big circle all again.' 'Circle to the right.' 'Now, circle to the left!' 'Now, it's to your home. Everybody home.' All ladies on the inside, gents on the outside. Form a double circle. 'Yeah!' 'Ladies, go left and the gents go right.' 'Ladies, go right and the gents go left.' 'Now, everybody swing. Just grab anybody and let's go.' 'Yeah!' Ladies and gentlemen.. ...by popular demand, I've been asked to call on our own Bill Harkins. Why don't you sing one for me? Please, Bill. I will if you'll save the next waltz for me. Alright. Hey, thanks, Bill. You boys play "Love Begins At Evening?" - You bet, we do. - Yeah, we do. You boys mind playing me a waltz? Anything you say. - Dance, Mary? - Wha.. - Well, I promised-- - First come, first serve. Excuse me, Roy, but this is my dance. I thought you promised me this dance. I did, but Roy insisted. I guess he's looking for trouble. Now, Bill, you know what you promised. It's alright, I won't start anything. Seems to me like Mr. Harkins has kinda got his own way. - You think so? - Looks like it. Sometimes looks are deceiving. - Mind if I cut in? - Alright, Mr. Tolliver. - But only once around. - Now, don't be stingy. Can't a fellow dance with his own daughter? Hey, Harkins. What's the idea of breakin' in when I'm dancing with my girl? - So Mary's your girl? - Yeah. Funny I hadn't heard about it before. Well, you're hearin' about it now. What's goin' on out here? Come on, Bill! Come on, Bill! Get him! - Stop right there. Break it up! - If there's gonna be a fight-- We don't stand for no gang fightin' around here. And no gun play neither. Give room. - 'Come on!' - 'Come on, Bill!' Hit him. Come on, hit him. Come on, Bill! Attaboy, Bill. Hit him, Bill. Hit him, Bill. Come on, boy. Boy, he sure finished him off good. Dad, let's go home. But, Mary, aren't you gonna wait for Bill? No, I'm going. - Good goin'. - Alright. Say, Bill, if you're looking for Mary she just left for home with her father. You're gonna be in shape to drive that race? I'm alright, I tell you, it was a lucky punch. Well, I hope you're alright. Most of our money is on you to win. We'll win. We're not taking any chances. What do you mean? I mean we've got to fix that Harkins' stage so it won't finish. What do we do? Take an axe and break it up? Oh, you can't do that. They'd postpone the race. We want 'em to start. Well, we might under-saw the spokes on one of the wheels. Now, that's it. Al, you and Charlie and Bud get over at the Harkins Ranch right away and fix that coach good. Well, I'm gonna pull off my Sunday clothes first. Y'all get some saws and I'll be right with you. It's in here. Stay here and keep an eye open. - I'll watch things. - You got it. Hey, this sure is a pretty wagon. It's a shame to mess it up. Come on, get to working on this wheel. Well, uh, let's cut it on the inside so it won't show. Well, that's where the boss said to saw. Well, I hate to tell him what I know.. Duck, boys. Bill Harkins is coming. Well, Smoke, old boy, you missed your dinner, didn't you? Well, I'll make up for it now. A nice, big one. Come on, let's finish it up and get out of here. Few more spokes and we're through. I made all the bets I could in here and spread a lot around town. A hundred more on Banton. Fifty on Ferguson. Ferguson, $50. Harkins, $50.. I wanna bet it all on Roy Banton. How much you got there? I've got eleven dollars, two nickels and a dime. Eleven dollars, two nickels and a dime. That big gazook would bet his boots if he could find anybody with feet big enough to wear 'em. Wait a minute, how much can I bet with my watch? It's gold. - How much do you want for it? - Uh, $25. - Give you five. - I'll take it. Well, I'm sure clean. I even bet my gold watch. - Here's 20 more on Banton. - Twenty more on Banton. Hey, I want to bet $1000 on Bill Harkins. - 'What?' - Get over there. - Thousand on Harkins. - Well, now I am in no possi-- Alright, Jake, I'll take that bet. Yeah, tighten up on that inside breech. Tie one link. There. Careful now, boys, everything's gotta be alright. Come on, bring in them leaders. Hurry up, boys. - You know who I'm betting on? - Who? - Bill Harkins. He can't lose. - Ah. Hello, Mary, thought you promised I could take you home last night. And I thought you promised you wouldn't hunt for trouble. I didn't hunt for it. That fight was forced on me. - But, Bill-- - Listen, Mary. This race means an awful lot to me. Well, I can't win with you feeling this way. I'm sorry, Bill. You know how much I want you to win. That's all I wanted to know. According to my figures, when we win this race we'll be eating chicken for the rest of the year. And if we lose, we'll be eatin' a fish. Hey, Hank, you got the best lead team in the race. They ought to win for you. - Bettin' on you. - Good luck, Hank. Thanks, boys, I'll do my best. 'Drivers, get ready!' Good luck, Bill. Hurry up, son. We're all ready. Now, gentlemen.. ...the conditions of the race are as follows. "You will start with the firing of the gun. "Race down the main street and out through Coyote Valley Road. "The winner will receive the government's mail contract for this district." Use your head, now, son. Don't try to pass anybody on the turns. Don't worry, dad, I know every foot of the way. Remember, Bill, you're gonna win. You bet I am. Are you ready? 'Hurray!' The winner, Roy Banton. Wait, wait! Wait, wait! - Congratulations, Mr. Banton. - Thanks. The mail contract is yours. 'Hurray!' Sorry, Sam. I thought sure Bill would win. Hey, Banton, what happened to Bill Harkins? Bill? He can't drive a stagecoach. He went over the bank at Devil's Curve. Devil's Curve? Maybe he's hurt. Yes, yes, yes. Let's get my team and go after him. Yes. Didn't I tell you we was gonna have chicken? Darn right, but from now on I'm gonna have somethin' besides a wing. You can have all the chicken you can eat, Bud. No, can't eat that much. Come on, fellas, I'll set 'em up. Yeah, and we gotta collect some money too, don't forget. What happened? Did you get hurt? No, no, dad, I'm alright. Bill, how did it happen? Well, I tried to pass Banton on the curve up there. Felt the left side of the stage give way and I jumped, just in time. You must have hit a soft shoulder. Maybe. - I'm sorry, dad. - Oh, don't worry, Bill. It wasn't your fault. Accidents will happen. - This wasn't an accident. - What do you mean? Take a look at that wheel over there. Somebody sawed the spokes from the inside. If I knew the cuss that done that.. I'm going to find out who did it. Who owns that white stocking horse? Come on folks, don't be back. We'll get up there. I'll see you, Bart. Now, let's hop right in there. Now, have a good time. Remember I'm buyin', the sky's the limit. Alright. If you hadn't had that accident, Bill, I know you'd have won. Well, maybe. Why don't you stay home tomorrow and rest? I'll ride down, bring you some of that chocolate cake. I'll be as good as new tomorrow. But it's a pretty sweet thought. But, Bill, you ought to rest. Rest? I've got too much to do. I tell ya, I'll be over to see you tomorrow night. Thanks for your help, Dan. I'll send it right back with the team. No hurry, Sam. Wouldn't need 'em till tomorrow morning. I'm catching the early stage. Going over to Amityville for a day or two. Oh, you are? Well, we sure as going along ourselves. - That you do. - Come on, Bill. Goodbye, Dan. Thanks again. - Not at all, Sam. - Giddy up. Bye bye. Where are you going, son? I'm going over to Mary's, dad. Listen, I gotta use Sunny tonight. I wanna give Smoke a rest. Yeah, judging from the trips you're planning between here and Mary's, looks like all our horses gonna need a rest. Dad, you ought to be a mind reader. - Goodnight, son. - Goodnight, dad. Alright, get out of here and get out fast. Maybe I've got a way figured out to quiet Mr. Bill Harkins for keeps. Well, I've heard tell that he ain't such an easy fella to quiet. Supposing you saw a big fella holding up the stage riding a palomino horse with a shiny silver saddle. Who would you think the road agent was? Why, Bill Harkins, of course. That's just what everybody's going to think. 'Cause one of us is holding up that morning stage on his horse. But they say nobody can ride that horse but Bill. Who said so? There ain't no horse I can't ride. That's talking, Frank. Here's what you do. Take Al and Charlie, get over to the Harkins Ranch and hide out. After he's turned in for the night get that horse in the saddle. You know the rest. After that it's a one man job, Frank. I got you. Come on, boys. Frank.. ...it might not be a bad idea to, kind of, plug somebody during that hold-up. - Understand? - Sure. Well, it looks like Mr. Harkins is goin' dancing again. But this time with the end of a rope. Bill, where you've been so late? Dad, I found out about the Bantons. The Bantons? They're robbing their own stagecoaches. How do you know? Well, I saw them and followed them. And Roy Banton was riding that white stocking horse. Then it was Banton who tried to get you. Had another close shave tonight. They followed me for miles. - Let's go get the sheriff. - No, no, dad. It wouldn't do any good. I have no proof. It's just my word against theirs. Well, what are you gonna do? We'll get together some of our friends and catch them in the act. You know, if they heard that there was a gold shipment going through.. Bill, you've got it. I'm sure the bank will cooperate with us. I'll see Johnson in the morning. Alright, dad. I'm gonna go get some sleep. Goodnight. There he is, boys. Cut him out in that flat and he ought to be easy to catch. Whoa, you hammerhead. Absolute broad feet. Come down here. I'll lay you down, Polly. Alright, boys, get the saddle on him. 'Put down that mailbags.' Your money and jewelry. Throw it out here on the ground. - Bill! - You made good guess, Tolliver. Now get goin'. The stage ought to be here in any minute now. You'd better come inside and wait. Keep out of the hot sun. Alright, Jim. Thank you. I'll tie the team up around the corner. - Be right back. - Fine. Why, good morning, Mary. - Hello, Mr. Harkins. - What are you doing in town? Dad's coming in on the coach. He doesn't expect me to meet him. - So I'm going to surprise him. - Oh, I see. Well, I'm just going down the bank for a few minutes. I'll be back and we'll both surprise him. - Oh, Mr. Harkins. - Yeah. Why didn't Bill come out to see me last night? Oh, didn't he? Oh, oh, yes, well, well, you see, Mary Bill had to ride out last night on, on some important business. Oh, I see. Whoa! Call them doctor. Somebody. Get a doctor, quick! - What's the problem? - What's the problem? - What happened? - We were held up. - They shot Dan Tolliver. - 'Dan Tolliver?' Is he hurt bad? Take him inside. - What's the matter? - He killed Tolliver. Anybody go for a doctor? - How many was there? - Just one. He was riding a palomino horse with a silver saddle. Bill Harkins the only one around here who's got a palomino horse. Yeah, and that's just who it was, Bill Harkins. Is he alright, Mr. Harkins? I don't know, Mary. We've to wait till the doctor gets here. Here's the doc now. 'Bill Harkins, it was nobody else but him.' - Get the sheriff. - We don't want no sheriff. 'Get a rope and we'll string him..' What's going on? What's going on here? Bill Harkins held up the stage and shot Dan Tolliver. - We're gonna string him up. - None of that lynching talk. We got law in this town. I'll handle this. Where's Dan? He's in the hotel. - Bill. Bill? - What do you want, dad? Somebody held up the stage and killed Dan Tolliver. - No. - They're sayin' you did it. - Me? - Yeah. The driver said it was your horse and he recognized your silver saddle. They're coming for you. You better get out of here. Why should I, dad? I didn't do it. But they're talking of lynching. You can't reason with them. Get away till this thing's cleared up. Here they come now. Somebody get a rope. - You still got time. - No, no, dad, I'm staying. - Hello, sheriff. - Hello, Bill. I guess you'll have to come with me. There's a charge of murder against you. Sherriff, there's something funny about this. I was right here in the house with dad at the time that hold-up took place. Yes, sheriff, that's the gospel truth and I'll swear to it. Well, I reckon that I'd say the same thing for my son if I was in your place, Sam. But it's no good. I gotta lock him up. Well, sheriff, before you lock me up do you mind if I take a run down to the pasture and see if my horse is still there? We'll send somebody down for you, Bill. Alright, sheriff. - All I ask is a fair trial. - You'll get it. We'll give him a fair trial at the end of a rope. Hold on, now, hold on, boys. Hold on, there. I've been sheriff here for a great many years. And I wanna keep my slate clean. Don't listen to him, men. Don't listen to him, men. Let's get that killer! - Wait a minute, boys. - Come on, let's get him. I don't want to cause any bloodshed here unless I have to. But I'm going to take this boy to jail and he's going to get a fair trial. The sheriff's right, men. Give him a fair trial. - That's right. - That's the ticket, boys. I'm glad to see you're gonna let the law take its course. This town's always had a good record. Now let's keep it that way. Ah, thank you, sheriff.. Let's go. Yes, sir, Frank was sure dependable. Oh, he never slips up. Well, it didn't work. The sheriff talked 'em out of it and they took Harkins to jail. Pete Nelson's night guard at the jail now. - Isn't he? - Yeah. Get him over here. I want to talk to him. I'll get him right away. If you want any favors from him, you'll have to pay for it. You wait and see. No, Bill, I think the only thing to do is to tell the sheriff all you know about the Bantons. No, dad, he'll probably bungle the whole thing. We've gotta go through with our original plan. Did you see Johnson at the bank? No, not yet. Was on the way over there when all this happened. You'd better go over and see him right away. Make sure that that fake gold shipment goes through. Let the Bantons get wind of it and we've got 'em red handed. Alright, Bill. I'll go right over. I think I can count on Joe Johnson. We've been friends a long time. - Alright, son. - Goodbye, dad. Now, look, Pete. We're gonna give you a chance to do something for this community. Yeah? That's fine. Supposing Bill Harkins tried to escape and you shot him. - You'd be a hero, wouldn't you? - Say, what are you gettin' at? You know, uh, the Bantons have quite a pull in this town and the sheriff's getting kinda old, Pete. - You mean-- - 'That's just what I mean.' That'll put you in line for the sheriff's job. What do you want me to do? Tonight, when everything's quiet, you go to Bill Harkins and tell him you don't think he did it. You're gonna give him a chance. You're gonna let him escape. Then, when he starts runnin'.. Well, use your own judgement. I get you. Of course, I'm as anxious to clear this thing up as you are, Sam. but after all, your request is rather unusual. But, Joe, the bank doesn't stand to lose anything. Naturally, this supposed gold shipments are nothing but rocks. Even if a stage isn't held up what harm's been done? Oh, none at all. I sure would like to catch those road agents. Well, here's your chance to do it right now. What do you say? - Yes, Sam, I will. - Good. Now, as I get it, the idea is that we're to simply let it leak out that we're shipping a lot of gold on the late stage. That's it. Roy, I just heard something very interestin'. Yeah? The bank is sendin' out a big gold shipment on that late stage tomorrow. How do you know? Well, the kid that works in the bank was over in the saloon. He was drunk and he told me so. Funny, we didn't hear nothin' about it. He said they wanted to keep it quiet on the account of road agents. Better get the boys together. Brought you a little fresh water. Bill, I just can't believe you held up that stage and shot Dan Tolliver. I didn't, Pete. It's mighty nice of you to feel that way. I believe you, They were just goin' hog-wild accusin' ya of it. Bill, I wanna help you. Help me? How? Come on, I'll show you. Take a look. Smokey! Where'd you get him? Ed Burke found him wandering around back at the barn. He did? I heard a lot of threatening talk in town this afternoon about lynchin'. Bill, you're not safe here. And neither am I if I have to keep them out. Just what are you driving at? Listen, Bill, I'm gonna let you out of here. Get on your horse and ride back into the hills and hide out until this thing is settled. Well, thanks, Pete.. ...but I'm staying. I had nothing to do with that hold-up and I can prove it. Alright, who put you up to this? Who was it? Was it Roy Banton? Was it? Yeah. Well, you give Banton that from me. I sure wish you weren't leaving us tomorrow, Ms. Mary. Nothing to keep me here now, Jim. I guess I know just how you feel. Anything more I can do before I turn in? No, thanks, Jim. I'll be alright. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. 'Mary.' - I want to talk to you. - How could you come here? Mary, I had nothing to do with that hold-up. - A dozen people saw you. - I don't care what they saw. How could I.. Why should I do such a thing? You were coming to see me that night but you had more important business. - But, Mary, I didn't-- - I'm sorry. - Please go. - He'll get out, alright. Come on, Harkins. You're going back to jail with me. - Get movin'. - Wait a minute, Jim. Let him go. Just be sure he leaves the ranch. - Why, Bill, how'd you get away? - Never mind that now. I've only got a minute. Dad, I know who killed Dan Tolliver. It was Frank Wyatt. One of the Banton boys. I found his body down near the scene of the hold-up. Smokey must have killed him. I found the mailbag he stole too. - Did you get the sh-- - No, but.. We've gotta work fast. I want you to make sure that that fake gold shipment goes through tomorrow. - That's all arranged. - Good. Get together all our friends and I'll meet you at Big Fort tomorrow morning. Alright, son, we'll be there. Goodbye, dad, I've gotta hurry. Good luck. Stay where you are, I got you covered. It's Bill Harkins, sheriff. - Oh, y'all broke jail, eh? - I'll explain later, sheriff. - You've gotta come with me. - What's this all about? Sheriff, I'm gonna take you to the man who held up that stage and killed Dan Tolliver. Frank Wyatt. - You sure about that? - I'll prove it to you. Bill, if you can prove your innocence there would be nobody happier than me. I'll not only prove it to you, sheriff but I'll show you who's at the bottom of all this. There he is, sheriff. Yeah, it's Frank Wyatt, alright. Well, that's one of 'em out of the way. Better not waste any more time here, sheriff. We got a lot to do before morning. I sure hate to see you leave us, Mary. I think it's for the best. All aboard. Tim? Careful! Now, remember, boys. All we want is that gold shipment. Don't bother with the passengers. Oh, shucks. I wanted to get myself a gold watch. What would you do with it? You can't tell time know-how. Alright, boys, get that strongbox down. Dead right, Bill. Let's get movin'. - Rocks. - Yeah, we're bein' crossed up. I'll give you one more chance to tell the truth. Who held up that stage and killed Dan Tolliver? - I don't know, sheriff-- - Stop your lyin'! We know how did it. It was you. - And you're gonna swing for it. - No, it wasn't. No, it wasn't. I'll tell ya, it was Frank Wyatt. - Oh, Frank Wyatt, eh? - Yeah, Banton had him do it. Oh, he did, eh? Bill, I, I can't tell you.. Ah, don't try to, honey. -- English --
