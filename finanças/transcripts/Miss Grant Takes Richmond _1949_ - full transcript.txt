WOODRUFF SECRETARY SCHOOL Ladies, I don't think I need to remind you of tomorrow's final exam. And a Woodruff School diploma guarantees a well-paying job. Most of them don’t have to worry. But if I were a certain young lady in this class ... now I would go home immediately and start learning very, very hard. Unless you want to prepare for it for another year. The class can leave. - Good night, Mrs. Grant. - Good night dear. - Good night, Judge. - Good night, Ralph. - Good night, Ellen. "Good night, Ralph, I had a wonderful time." - Oh, Ralph, are you leaving? - To go? Don't be silly, I wasn't even here. I'm sorry, but I have to take the final exam tomorrow. - Maybe he'll succeed. - Then I hope you will succeed. Once you take the exam, you can forget about it all. I'll escort you to the door, Ralph. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Seriously, Ellen, so you can't treat a boy. I just don’t understand all this fuss about being a secretary. I just want to get a job. I can't live with you and Uncle Ben forever. Otherwise, being a secretary can be the first step to becoming a great. You don't know where it will lead. The President of the United States also started at the Hubbard Lard Factory. And now you're in a better position? It's not like your uncle and I want to get rid of you, darling. You know not. But have you heard of girls getting married? Well, if I don't get a job, maybe I'll get married. - Good night, darling. - Good night, Aunt Mae. Of course, this is not something that boys and girls dream of, but in the end, the deputy district attorney decides on homes, charities, and children. This is more than what a typist can do. Well ... I think so. Attention, ladies! This is Mr. Richmond from the Richmond Real Estate Agency, who is here to find a new secretary for himself. I called you to watch the whole class. Needless to say, their job will decide the thing. So the winner takes it all. The first task will be a simple business letter. Please describe what I dictate. Notebook ... pencils ... Done ... on. Dear Vincent Franklin, Midwestern Rail Company, Allenville, IL Dear Sir, As we agreed in our phone conversation on June 4 ... we are waiting for a prepaid letter ... listing the 40 items as soon as possible. As we agreed, the price we charged ... - It will be designed according to the closing value, - What did you say? measured on the Chicago Board of Trade that day. Thank you in advance for acting properly. Sincerely, Consolidated Products Company Jasperty Witherspoon, material purchaser Ladies ... they have exactly 45 seconds to rewrite their note. I would like three copies. They can get ready ... they can start. Miss Grant... Miss Grant. Miss Grant! I'll collect the papers for you to look at, Mr. Richmond. Well, did you manage to pick someone? Yes, that girl. Write a report about it immediately. Great, great. - Which girl? - That girl. But Miss Grant! Well ... Richmond is taking Miss Grant. Richmond Real Estate Agency I know exactly what he's going to say, Mr. Woodruff. You wouldn't think I'd ever be a secretary. So I think I need to become a wife. You don't understand, Miss Grant. They just picked it up. Have you been hired? I can not believe! Me neither. Try not to bring too much shame to the Woodruff School. Hmm? Don't worry, Mr. Woodruff, I also put my last five to be a secretary. I will be a good secretary even if I die. - I'll send flowers. - Huh? Whatever we accept, we need to find a place to live. My husband is a veteran, it just matters. We live in a garage. Please, people, I told you to call yourself when an apartment becomes vacant. One moment, people. I need to prioritize requests. They have to help. The doctor said my majesty is expecting triplets. And you want me to help? I said no ... Repeat. Do you have an apartment for rent? Two bedrooms with beds, kitchen, dining room, breakfast corner. Donegal Avenue 720. Wait while I describe it. Donegal Avenue 720. Well, thank you very much ... He called the wrong number. - I'm the new secretary. - Oh yes? Mr. Richmond recently hired me. Please come here. Oh, forgive me. Again? Mr. Richmond, your new secretary is here. Make sure you have all the equipment. You seem to have all the necessary equipment. - Welcome. - Hi, Miss Grant. - Have a seat. - Thank you. I guess I wonder why I chose you. Well, honestly I like the look of it. This work requires personality and a pleasant appearance. It’s more of a receptionist job than a typist. Oh, that's good. Who will I have to receive? People come in here when it comes to renting an apartment . I'm too busy so all you have to do is sit there and listen to their problems. - Just sitting there? - That is all. Do you think you can do it? Oh, yes, sir. I can do that for sure , Mr. Richmond. That's great. I want you to get to know the staff. This is Mr. Gleason. - Yes. - Also. Miss Grant, this is Mr. Kilcoyne, our salesman. - Oh, I'm glad. - I'm glad. Gentlemen and I are working on an important project ... in an advertising nature. It takes all our time. There is one important thing. That room is our meeting room. And they can never bother you. No one can enter Mr. Gleason, Mr. Kilcoyne, and me. And that applies to you. Is that clear, Miss Grant? Yes, yes, it is completely clear. All right, you can go to work now . Thank you for the opportunity. I will do my best to make you satisfied, Mr. Richmond. I will do my best. I was very happy to meet you, gentlemen. And I won't forget what you said about that room, Mr. Richmond. - What is this? - That's exactly what I was looking for. He sees nothing, hears nothing and knows nothing. Found? Yes, Herb. 200 to eight in tomorrow morning's race. I typed you. Hallo? Yes, Jack. Battle Station, Belmount No. 7. Found? No, it's too late to resign. What the hell had to pick up a pushed woman again ? Perfect. Nice eyes, nice hair and nothing underneath. I just see another mouth that tans everything. How could you talk? You won't see anything. And if he saw something, he would n't understand. And if he understood, who would believe him? The lineup is perfect. We have a beauty in the front office and our brains in the back office. Calm down. Let's see how we stand. Start counting. 2.26, 51, 51.98, 3.30, 57, 106.20, 68, 47, 69.99, 35.50, 56.10 $ 509 30 cents. No problem if I check on the calculator? What kind of cheekiness, I checked the calculator at the bank. Well, your stunt makes sense. As you used to notice in the bank the money you "borrowed." She was a woman who knocked her down. Guys, let's forget this lady. He was the dumbest thing in the whole school. Like my wife, but I still pay her alimony. Look guys, just leave things to me. They will never catch you. That’s what my good faith said when I bit the bait. Silence in the courtroom! Did you receive the eviction warning? How did we get it? Our kind-hearted landlord nailed it to the door. We've been living there for eight years, Judge. You can't just throw us out. Judge , I have acted in full respect of my rights. I'm afraid so. Eviction is allowed. Next case, please. Johnson v Charles and Jane Meyers. Well, what a busy day you have today, Mr. Johnson. I'm sorry, but these residents have to go before the apartment house can be rebuilt. Which will be gorgeous, big and modern. And expensive. Why not spend money on building cheap houses, where can people live without saving on rent for the child? Judge, the law is perfectly clear on this matter. The law is clear on this matter. Eviction is allowed. This is terrible. Silence in the courtroom! I'm sorry, Judge. The court is taking a break. - Hello. - Hello. - I am so sorry. - But he's your uncle. And you will get yours from me. Miss, I'm waiting in my room. Sorry. Miss, when I am very hungry, I always get out of my way. That’s exactly how I feel about the poor people they put out of their homes. Listen, the housing problems in this city are not my business or yours. Well, it just turned out to be my business. And when the right moment comes , don’t think that I will not discuss this with my boss. With your boss? What are you going to do? Are you paying someone or something? Who is he? Mr. Richard Richmond from the Richmond Real Estate Agency. And all I have to do is sit and wait for people to come in and I discuss their housing problem with them. You mean ... wait a minute. You mean, like, people are going to discuss their problem with you? Exactly. Well ... I anticipate that a lot more new cases will come to my court. He meatballs again. OPEN PLEASE COME IN! What are these many boards? I don't know, maybe someone left them here. Or the brain you picked up moved your brain . How could you move your brain when you don’t even have a brain? Let's find out what this is all about. FIND A RENTAL WITH RICHMOND REAL ESTATE AGENCY WANT TO RENT AN APARTMENT? CALL RICHMOND REAL ESTATE Oh, good morning! Miss Grant, where are those boards? Mr. Richmond, you don't even realize how many people are looking for a cheap apartment. I appreciate your effort, but it doesn’t make sense to exhaust yourself that way. I like to occupy myself and well ... I don't seem to have much to do here. Well, you will have a lot to do ... As a matter of fact, Mr. Gleason has some letters which should be noted down now. - Indeed? - Yes, yes, remember? Oh, yes, they can wait. You can't run an office efficiently, if you accumulate things, Mr. Gleason. That was one of the first things I was taught in school. Miss Grant is absolutely right. You better get started, Mr. Gleason. Igen, Mr. Richmond. Forgive me. - Everything is alright? - All right. Dear Sir! Dear Sir... Where did I keep it? Dear Sir! Oh yes... Excuse me for a moment, I'll be right back. Hey, I can't just dictate. Here, answer this request. - What to say? - Say anything. - Tell us we're going to buy the land. - Why? Why? What does it matter until we send the letter? All right, Mr. Richmond. You're the boss, Mr. Richmond. Where did I keep it? Dear Sir! Excuse me for a moment, I'll be right back. Oh, just leave it. Address the letter ... To Vincent Regional Development Company. Area M number 12540. Sir! - Isn't that too intrusive? - No, sir. I’m not very good at shorthand, but if I get stuck I only use a “what to call”. - What are you using? - A "what's called". You know, when I don’t remember the right term, I write something else, “what’s it called”. Oh, yeah ... "What's it called, what's it called." - That's really brilliant. - Thank you. Again... In the case of your offer, I am writing to sell 20 acres of land from the Vincent Knolls estate. For $ 60,000 ... I would like to say that we do not consider it excluded that we accept your offer. - We do not know? - What don't we know? - How do we accept their offer? - That's what we're doing. He said "I want to." Well, fix it. Let's make a deal as soon as possible. Sincerely, Timothy P. Gleason, Vice President. You know, I know that land very well , Mr. Gleason. Wonderful place to build a housing estate. That's what we thought. A low-budget housing estate for investment? The costs were not discussed at all. Carefully designed and compact? So compact that ... Well, they'll call it "Richmond Dream Homes," that's all. If you want good for yourself, come back another time, Dick won't get it, you know? You're still struggling to learn English , aren't you? Dick is here somewhere. I don't care if you ... Who is he? He acts like he has the place. Now it could be his at any moment . This hiding place is not worthy of a talented man like you ... and a tasteful girl like me , Mr. Richmond. Only three rooms and a reception table, but we find it homely. Of course, this is not like the company your husband left you, Mrs. Donato. I mean, what you left to your son isn't it? Here, even whiskey is second class. You've changed, Peggy. You used to get to the subject much faster . Well... My request will sound old-fashioned. Why don't you let me get you out of here? Back to your organization? Back to the big fish, back to the big city. I prefer it here with smaller bets. I have a long life line, so I want to keep it that way. No one who is on my side is hurt . Think about it. You could control the whole syndicate for me. No thanks. Here I have everything I can control. Do you mean "Miss Deer" in the front office? It is strictly a labor affair. Like he was with us, darling? As he should have been with us. U.S... It was a wasted morning. I could have done my nails. Your nails are fine, Peggy. Goodbye, honey. Bye bye... Your lifeline seems a little shorter now. Relax, honey. He doesn't poison anyone. - What's wrong with him? - Oh, this is a pushed woman. Here is the letter from the land at Vincent Knolls. Sign and I'll send it. One moment, let me take a look at it. 60 thousand? Did you offer 60,000? Well, it looked like a nice round number. To the wheel that came to mind ... It's not worth that much. That's a very nice piece of land, Mr. Richmond. It is almost the only land in the city where a real housing estate can be built. Who wants to build a housing estate ?! Apart from me? You know, we talked about it. Yes ... yes ... well ... 55 thousand is the most I pay and I know they will accept so we can even leave that at that. - But, Mr. Richmond ... - That's all, Miss Grant. Yes sir. "And you can go to lunch, Miss Grant." - Yes sir. Do you want to put it all on "Ceratong"? Yes, sir, I bet. Hey, the whole place is full of home seekers. They think we will furnish their mantelpiece. "Is that little girl back from lunch?" - No, no, no, no, Mr. Richmond ... - You may not be grateful to you. - It's been an hour and a half. - Well grateful for that. - You can't eat that much with your lunch ticket. You better supervise the front office. We do n't want strangers to get lost here. The next stranger I'm going to shake down will be the "what to call it" guy. - What kind of guy? - "What's it called." Did you know that instead of a word you can't describe , you write "what's it called?" - Do they have any in a yard? - In the yard? We do not sell yards. - Do they have any for $ 8,000? - Yes, in Maison, you know. That's too far. I have once said that we do not have an apartment for rent , we do not even have a telephone booth. But Ellen called that maybe they would have an apartment for rent soon. - It will be if he arranges it himself. - I think that's what he's planning. Yes, I think ... What? Why don't they look across the road? I heard about many apartments for rent there. Yes Yes. Call me back. Hey, I saw you come back with suspicious-looking figures. - How do they look? - You know, innocent and well-mannered boys. - You worry too much. "She looks more worried." - All right, turn down the phones. - Good. Hello, Mr. Richmond. We're just coming from the land. - Land? - Vincent Knolls and find out what happened? - What? You don’t have to pay 55,000, you can own the land for 50,000. - Really? - Yes. This is Mr. Hopkins, the sales agent. I showed him the plan and accepted it. Miss Grant bargained hard, Mr. Richmond, but I brought the necessary papers. Wait a minute, I don't understand that. Miss Grant is just my secretary. You do not have the right to do business on my behalf. But Mr. Richmond, I ... said if you could get it for 55,000 ... Forget what I said! I changed my mind... - Is something wrong? - Oh, I'm sorry. Mr. Richmond, this is Mr. Ralph Winton. - I'm glad. - I'm glad. I was looking for your permission, I didn’t even notice it in the front office. That's what comes to mind ... I think I should hang it, but it doesn't fit the wallpaper. You know the law requires you to put your license in a prominent place. Quote from Section 63 (B) of the City Ordinance. Ralph likes to draw people’s attention to the fact that he’s the new deputy district attorney. Deputy District Attorney? - Well, it could be an interesting job. - That's right. Much more interesting than money. Well, let's sit down. - Sit here, Mr. Hopkins. - Thank you. U.S... - What were we talking about? - About the land. Land estate? Oh yeah, very nice piece of land. You couldn't find a better one at this price ... and all we ask is that you pay an advance of $ 5,000 along with the rest. Mr. Hopkins said it usually takes 3 weeks to hand over an area, but I persuaded us to get things done in a week now . Well, that's a convenient measure. Well, can we clarify the terms of the transfer? First I would like to ask a few questions about ... - About what? - THE... on parcelling, yes on parcelling. There are some specifications, but don’t worry about it. I’m sure my uncle can smooth them out. I told him about the project and he is very interested in it. And Mr. Richmond, you want to meet you in person. - Your uncle? - Judge Grant. Judge Grant? It would only take us a minute to close this deal, Mr. Richmond. I don’t think he would refuse to save $ 5,000. Well, where do I have to sign? Miss Grant, I am sure I can be rewarded somehow for this amazing performance. Oh, Mr. Richmond, I just want the reward of being able to do more. That's exactly what I was thinking. It will be best if we fire this lady! All right, but until you go it costs us $ 2,500 a day. It’s $ 104 an hour, $ 1.75 a minute, and $ 2.9 a cent a second. This calculation never comes in anyway. This speech produces a surplus of $ 507.10. All right, kick it out. This is the speech! Kick it out! Let's wait a minute. Who's the boss here? Whose idea was it to hire the woman with a friend of the district attorney and an uncle of a judge? If you have a brother ... then the warden. All right, I'll do it. One moment, you shouldn't be suspicious. What should I tell him? Will we fire you because you saved $ 5,000? This does not make sense. And does it make sense to buy 20 acres of land? Suppose someone wins with a 3 bet ? What are we going to pay? With filth? - Got it! We get him to quit. - You have to kill me for that. That's the point. We work overtime. We get 8, 10, 16 hours of work. Nothing but work, work, work. And in three days, you know what's going to happen? We will have 100,000 acres of land. While we are preparing, we want to provide every detail for the housing estate project. We can ensure that this is a modern development with the most up-to-date innovations, which falls within the range of the average earnings of this community . Therefore, we recommend that you do not take any action regarding your housing until we apply, which is expected in the very near future. Interest in additional information is unnecessary. We will inform you as soon as possible . Richmond Real Estate Agency wants nothing more ... just to help you make a useful investment ... and to find a pleasant home for themselves. Yours sincerely, For making yourself a bigger and better home, Mr. Richmond , President of the Richmond Real Estate Agency. Did you describe it? - No, sir. - What? I was a little behind. From where? Where did you start? Describe the general things, just put in a few “what to call” and fill in your own words. - Yes sir. - Listen, Miss Grant. You know the people of the city, I want you to get a phone book ... and would choose 400 of them to whom he would send a brochure and a letter. Yes sir. - Oh, I could reproduce the letter. - No, I think you should type. Let's be a little more personal, right? - Indeed? - Of course. And Miss Grant, I want you to collect ... it would list all doctors, lawyers, dentists and them in a separate file. - Yes sir. - You better put together a separate file ... also for businessmen, workers and civil servants. Yes sir. - And Miss Grant. - Yes sir? Make a file for the files. A file for the files. Yes sir. And I only give it a few days. A couple of days? Well, if you're done with it sooner, that's fine , too. Yes sir. Next! Maybe I should steam my mouth in the morning. If I can’t rest very soon I wo n’t be able to raise my hammer. We have to move on, Judge. This project is home to many people. I don’t know much about projects, but I do know that this job is too burdensome for you Ellen and you should quit. To cancel? After so much work, the others would never forgive me. Well, there's no sign of life. I just hope you have so much power to say "I'm resigning." Good morning! Everything is ready! This will cause us further dilemmas . It was a big job, the cost of materials was $ 83. Miss Grant, I don't know how we're going to be able to thank you for this, but we will find out. Oh, nothing. Head to the courtroom, gentlemen. How did you do it all? Yet we were flooded with work. This does not make sense. If I love horse racing and that little woman loves to work, then I am a bigger horse. Maybe we've been too kind to him so far. Yes, I think there is something in it. Then I'll sigh ... Wait a minute, wait a minute. There are things that a girl like this hates much more than shouting. Only yours, Mr. Richmond. In light of our 10 phone conversations, that you wish to be included in your offer. I want to say here and now ... I want to say here and now that while the Richmond Real Estate Agency is involved, until then there is no business. It's not a question of money. 100 thousand minus mortgages and interest seems a very reasonable number. Very reasonable number. However, taking into account the market and the accompanying parcel law, we decided it wasn’t the right time to go into a deal this big. On behalf of the members of the Management Board, "hogyishívják", "hogyishívják", "hogyishívják"... Sincerely, Richmond Real Estate Agency President Dick Richmond. - Miss Grant. - Not finished yet? Not quite. "Miss Grant, you're doing a great job." - Oh thank you. And I tend to reward effective secretaries in a special way. - Really? - Aha. - So? - He kissed her. Mr. Richmond, this should not have been the case. But I'm glad you did. - How many secretaries have you had so far? - Dozens. Mr. Richmond, you should be ashamed of yourself! Everyone says that. - Do you know what I usually do? - What? - Did you get rid of it? - Get rid of it? He didn't even get out of his mouth. Ó, Dick... Do you do this with all your secretaries? No... Some were men. Mr. Richmond, I'm not used to this kind of treatment! That will go hand in hand with experience. I have all the experience I wanted. Calm down, baby. - New track record. - After that, you'll have to lean. - I left here! - You don't give up, do you? I've been exhausted, Mr. Richmond. Go to the market for a new secretary, who is young, handsome and fit. Hey, Ellen. Guys! "But, Ellen, where are you going?" - Where are you in such a hurry? Don't you thank your friends anymore? I'm sorry, I think something went in my eyes. You can tell us about the housing estate investment. Yes. We're going to be in it, aren't we? I don't know, I quit. Oh, no! We talked to the Shaws, the Cubers, the Mills, and a lot of other people. Don't let us down. Well ... I just don't have enough experience on certain issues. Then it all remains a wonderful daydream. You could still talk about it with Mr. Richmond. Oh, no. If you quit, how are we going to know what kind of funny things are going on inside? He wasn't that funny. They excite people, they lose their money and nothing happens. We have heard that what you and Judge Grant are saying must be certain. We can search further. I'm sure you'll find something. We can find many things. They just ask for all our wealth. Are you sure it's all up to me? If you had as little money as us, Ellen, then you need to be sure it gets in the right place. That's right. Then I'm in it. Driver, stop the bus! Ma'am, if you start something with this cheap housing, I'll take it back in person. Thanks. U.S... With $ 5,000 minus, the bank balance should be exactly $ 12,066 and 85 cents. - 95 cents. - I'm sorry. Which is why he left because of the slender woman . All right, all right, I made a mistake. Now he is gone and we can breathe again. He managed to chase him away for the third time. Miss Grant, you don't have to finish your outing. I'm not finishing anything, Mr. Richmond. I'm staying. I follow the housing construction project all the way to completion. - But ... - Here's a list of all the people who want to buy a house for themselves. I will arrange for you to meet them and give you the details tomorrow. But he would have had the right to resign after I behaved with you! And you can't know when your eyes will flash again. I wouldn't recommend it. But you are a pretty girl. I would be able to drive it myself. - Even him. - Yes, even me. Let's get things straight, gentlemen. Another outburst of emotion and I speak to my uncle, the judge, to get a cop to my desk. Gentlemen, to the courtroom. What are we doing here? $ 5,000? He's not there. I think "Miss Everything Solver" can arrange for us to get our money back. - Oh, for sure. - Interest rate. Home seekers will come here tomorrow with their bookers and we will charge our money for it. What do you mean? He mixed us in, he pulls us out of it. You don't want your uncle to get everything out of us, do you? But, Mr. Kilcoyne, don't be so rude. That's the way it is. Things seem pleasant and legal. We are in the real estate business. They pay the horse and we pass the money on their behalf. Our treatment fee is $ 5,000. That's legal, isn't it? Sure ... but they expect houses to be built here. What can we do if the builder back down and we can’t finish the investment? - That's the business. "Yes, and we'll give it to them." Richmond Real Estate Agency. Oh, Mrs. Donato ... No, Mr. Richmond never arrives so early. I could have known. He always loved spending his breakfast in bed. Mr. Richmond is just outside to check out one of our investments. Please give him a message. You better describe it, do it right, right? I can write down every word you can pronounce , Mrs. Donato. Tell Mr. Richmond you are investing 5,000 in the Flywell estate in Belmount. 5,000, Flywell estate, Belmount. I described it. Congratulations, I knew it would work. And I would have had such a wonderful answer. Hallo? Oh, hello Uncle Ben. Yes, Mr. Richmond said he could meet you at three this afternoon. Yes, we will meet then. Hello. Mr. Richmond, this is my uncle, Judge Ben Grant. - Welcome. - Welcome. Mr. Willecombe, our architect. - Welcome. - Welcome. Representative Reed. - Welcome. - Representative. And here are all the people who are interested in our houses. This is Mr. Dick Richmond, president of the Richmond Real Estate Agency. And this is Mr. Gleason, our vice president. I am. You have excellent taste, Mr. Richmond. This is one of my favourites. Don't you mind if I straighten it? Oh, no, I'll straighten it out. Well, can we sit down? It would be nice in a slightly more confidential place. So why don't we use the front office? Oh, no, Mr. Richmond, we can't be there ourselves. - What about the courtroom? - Because? - In there? - No no no. - We do a lot of important things in there. - Yes, it seems ... There is no more important issue than housing estate investment. You better give Mr. Gleason a chance to clean up inside. Yes, I clean up, sometimes everything is so dusty. Forgive me. - Cover everything! - Check? - Worse. We'll call you back. I’m sure people don’t mind a little mess. Come here, please. Wait a minute, Miss Grant. Mr. Gleason, you're so kind to clean up a little. - That's what the profession has taught you. - Yes, me too. This is Mr. Kilcoyne, he ... well, he's our vice president, too. - Welcome. - Welcome. Mr. Willecombe, please sit here. Representative Reed, would you sit there, please? Come on, everyone, come on in. Stand around. Make yourself comfortable. I hope they don’t mind having to stand. That's right. Well, I think we can start the discussion now. Mr. Richmond, my Uncle Ben offered to help you with your legal problems. Thank you, Judge. We hope we don't have a problem. Your mission is very impressive, Mr. Richmond. Not as an investor, of course. No, no, not as an investor. An investor? Mr. Richmond, that's what comes to mind. Mrs. Donato called in the morning ... Miss Grant, don't you mind if we move to the other office? Forgive me. "Didn't you have another attack?" - No no. What did Mrs. Donato want? Oh, Mrs. Donato ... He said he wants to invest 5,000 in the Flywell estate in Belmount. Yeah, well, it's one of our biggest lands and we have a lot of land in Belmount and ... Mrs. Donato investigated a little. Yes, I'm sure he's an excellent detective. You can go back, I'll be back in a minute. We ’re exactly in balance with that $ 1,000 offer . It's good you didn't bet 5,000 with Dick. I don't like his face. As the saying goes, "Something stinks in Denmark." Yes ... I have to remember never to put Denmark. Found? A moment. Dick ... Are you home? I'm always home to Dick. Hello, cheeky muzzle. How are things going on your side of town? That's exactly what I'm trying to find out. What is it all about from 5,000 to "Flywell"? This is a bet, Dick. You weren't inside, so I made the bet with your office. I respect your business methods. You know I can’t handle a 5,000 bet, it’s not my weight class. Then tell me back. Someone gave you a good tip, I'll do it with you . Is there something wrong with this? It's just that I'm not betting. Don't rush things, Dicky boy. I made that bet five hours ago. Isn’t it business ethics that you can’t cancel a bet half an hour before the race? If I win, I want to get my prize. - What's up? - Quickly check your bets on "Flywell". We have to bet 5,000 on it. - 5 thousand? - Use the phone in the front office. Please, Mr. Richmond, they are waiting for you. Go. Miss Grant, I appreciate you conveying an important message ... 5 hours later after receiving it. I'm sorry, Mr. Richmond. But I don’t think anything from Mrs. Donato would be too important. I have just told Representative Reed that one of the strengths of his investment is to break Johnson’s dominance in the housing market. Don’t want to continue the line with one or more cheap housing estate investments yet ? Oh, but ... Oh, of course, well ... Mr. Richmond ... As for the Belmount case ... There seems to be something very strange about this. Yes, it certainly looks. I don't like the offer. Tell me. Yes, I will resign as much as I can. "You better help him, Mr. Kilcoyne." - Yes. Found? Oh, yes ... Hello, hello Mr. Go ... Dougin. Yes, that is a very good choice. I will write it in the general ledger immediately. Of course I'm fine. It was Mr. Dougin. He wants to make money on the second ... estate. Pinnacle Street. That's on the west side. How much do you want to put on it? 200-at 200-al. We should divide it into two parts. Yes, if you'll excuse me ... we're going to split. Hello, Mike? Kilcoyne is talking. Pay attention... Nothing like that, nothing at all. I'll call you back. - We're looking for a cheap apartment. - Wait. - Hey, where are we going to call? - We don't have much time. You go to the cafe and I go to the pharmacy. That little woman will no doubt cause us many pleasant minutes. It's as pleasant as living in a poor hotel. And after every $ 100 down payment, I immediately hand over 1/50 of the land to the buyer. - If you agree, sir. - It's okay with me. - I'll pick it up. - I'll pick it up. Found? What do you make money on? Well, that's ... I don't have it. Listen, you heard me right. I'll pick you up, Miss Grant. Hallo? They won't let me do anything here. Yes, all right, we agreed. Fastest deal I've ever made. Mr. Richmond, if the phone rings, you have to let me give you a message. I have to prove that I have some use here. Well, Miss Grant, if you want to show how useful it is here, why don't you run away and bring us cold drinks? Cola or something. It's starting to get hot here and it's getting hotter. - Yes, that's for sure. - A little cold drink would be nice. Well, if they think they'll do without me ... - We'll try. - Well. One moment and I'm here. - Don't rush. - Hurry up. Mr. Richmond, can we discuss the general blueprint? Absolutely. - Can I help you? - Certainly. You are our last hope. Does waiting really make any sense? It really is. I don't want them to leave this room until I get back. Just sit down. Sorry. That contradicts the plan to sell the house ... Excuse me, Mr. Reed. Mr. Richmond, on the Belmount case ... We simply cannot get rid of that 5,000 acres of land. - Why not? "Well, something seems to stink from the west." Nobody wants to touch it. Have you tried the Chicago Real Estate Syndicate? All I found out was that they were avoiding the matter. They don't want any of it, nobody wants it. Mr. Richmond, can't you wait until after the trial? Oh, no, no, no. This is very important, you can't wait at all. Try Fenton Miller or someone. We only have 15 minutes. Igen, Mr. Richmond. Well then here is the question to decide. I don’t want to contradict you no matter what you say. Great, great. Isn't it fascinating, Mr. Richmond, that he doesn't want money? He wants to do good. "Isn't that right, Mr. Richmond?" - That's right, no doubt it is. Excellent. As for landscaping. I think a distance of 15 feet is required between each tree. - Exactly. - I do not know. It depends on the tree. Some of its roots grow to the surface and break through the tile. Really? I think he is right. No. I suggest we wait until ... Mr. Richmond called Fenton Miller and said no to the game ... the business. Keep trying. Look, phone service is too slow. It takes 15 minutes if the traffic is adequate. Use the phone in the front office. Didn’t your secretary say the front office phone was temporarily out of order? - Find another one, see him. - Yes sir. - Try Javelor in Las Vegas. - Javelor in Las Vegas, okay. - I'll get you a message. - No, no. - Hello? - It's full of energy. What? No thanks. Good luck next time. Javelor Las Vegas-bol. He wants to sell us 5 thousand moons. Well, I think the news has reached Las Vegas. - Should I try Harrigan in Los Angeles? - That's a good idea. The Richmond Real Estate Agency will never give up. You can't take it all alone, Ellen. No, I think you're right. I'm fencing someone out of the office to help. - What shall we do? - You can't be in all day. - We don't have much time. - Come. - Please replace this with pennies. - One minute and I'll do it, Ellen. Long distance call. He's turning on Los Angeles. Trinity 1X625. And please hurry! Hurry up, hurry up! I want another $ 50 cents to switch the number . Hallo? Harrigan? Gleason is talking. Thanks. Lebukni! Hold Harrgian. Hello Harrigan? Hey, would you make 5,000 for "Flywell" in Belmount? Then hurry up and look for it. Bill, the door is stuck. - I don't know how. - He's stuck. It brings reinforcement. Found? Us? Lebukni! Hold on, Harrigan! What about that? Let me do it. What are you two doing in there? Are they hiding? We are trying to make a very important business call. And we want some privacy. Well. Why not help take the cola to the office? All right ... all right. I will help you. Found, Harrigan? Found? Harrigan? Harrigan! I'm sorry, your call was disconnected. Then turn it back on again! Well, then we did everything. Miss Grant, would you accompany the people? I called them in, I accompanied them. I'm glad you liked the plans, Mr. Richmond. Goodbye, Mr. Richmond. I am pleased to see that the situation is encouraging. I hope so, Judge. - Goodbye, Mr. Richmond. - Bye bye. - Goodbye, Mr. Richmond. - Goodbye, honorable Member. - Goodbye, Mr. Richmond. - Bye bye. Listen, Harrigan said he'd take the bet from us. What keeps Gleason up? I hope there's something else about it. - Are they taking over the bet? - They wanted to pass, but the deadline was over and it was too late. Then hurry up, call them. As soon as I calculate how much chance they have of getting caught, I strangle that woman. Silence, silence. What is the job? They started. They are in the round. A sorrend: "Prince Hal", "Warsong" és "Tumbleweed". We have a dropout. A sorrend: "Prince Hal", "Warsong" és "Tumbleweed". He gallops quickly on the outer arch ... "Flywell." A sorrend: "Prince Hal", "Warsong" és "Flywell". There is still a chance. "Flywell" may still break his leg. A sorrend: "Warsong" és "Flywell". "Warsong" és "Flywell". Your two legs should break out. And the winner ... "Flywell" with a nose length. Oh, my back! Oh, my sore back! It broke into 50,000 pieces. Everything is going as well as possible. They were impressed with everything that was going on here. And Mr. Reed will persuade the city council to remove all restrictions. And they will give an additional five feet of area from pasture. Let me be six feet and dig myself there. Don't even pay attention. We have just had a major failure in the Belmount case. Oh, well, I’m glad I had nothing to do with that business. I'll pick you up, Miss Grant. Found, Mrs. Donato. You sound nervous, Dick. It was a good little race, wasn't it? Yes, great performance. How many trials did it take? Don't be bitter about it, Dick. Why don't you take me to dinner? Maybe we could continue where we left off. 50 thousand dollars ago. I'm going for eight for you. Where are we going to pay him the $ 50,000? I'm going to take you to dinner. That is, we have until eight. Miss Grant, call the Revier Club. Book a table for two for 9 p.m. Yes sir. So I turned to the judge and said, "Mr. Judge, I think you're making a mistake." I think he forgot section 63 (58) of the Penal Code . You can imagine what kind of head you cut, right? - Right? - Hmm? Oh, yes, yes ... You don't even pay attention to me. Well, I don't blame you for it. After all, I just talked about myself all night. All right, I'm talking about you now. You look especially beautiful tonight. Yes, because of the dress. I've always liked it. - This is my favorite. - Brand new. Well ... I mean, this is my favorite now. Thanks. - Did you only hire me because of me? - Hmm? I asked if you only hired me because of me? Oh, yes, yes. - Good evening. - A table for two called Richmond. That's what I'm asking for. Champagne cocktail. Just like in the old days, didn't it, Dicky? Not exactly. It's pretty similar to a start. Too bad for that race. Don't flutter your lashes too much. I'll get you $ 50,000 if you don't mind having to wait for it. You know I'm patient. That's good, because it's about. it will take six months. I can’t make you so patient. It would take so long for me to gather. I don’t know of a horse that does tricks for me. Maybe I can give it a few weeks. After all, I just sold my collection company. I know what you mean. Although I may be willing to forget it all. Then if you behave the way I want. - Oh, Mr. Richmond. - Welcome, Miss Grant. Winton. Imagine what a coincidence we meet here. Mr. Winton, Miss Grant. Mrs. Donato. - Welcome. - We have already met. "It definitely looks different tonight." - Thank you. Yes, I could barely recognize him without the typewriter on his lap. I could have known you could show up anywhere, Mrs. Donato. How's the big things going , Mr. Richmond? We're trying to make enough money right now . And there is no doubt that we are on the right track. - Well, good night. - Good night. - Good night. - See you in the morning. Maybe I'm going to be a little late in the morning. I have to deposit the checks, you know. - Checks? - The bookers. They just pour in. You are so effective, Miss Grant. You can work a lot of overtime at night. Oh, I don't mind Mr. Richmond either. - Good night. - Good night. I think you should get a new secretary , Dicky boy. I'm afraid I have to keep him, Peg. Then if you want your money back in a few weeks. But Dick, have a chance we'll collect 50,000 in a couple of weeks? We will not build those houses for nothing . - Build those houses? - Of course, why not? It will pass through our hands into many horses. Reserves, bank loans. It won't take long for us to levy 50,000 on them. Of course, we share the levy ... every damn day. Based on past experience, I know this is embezzlement. Dick, you can't swim with that much money. - So he does the bookkeeping? - Oh, the accounting will be excellent. But you have to build a couple of houses just to make it look real. And I'll leave my calculator at home. We don't have enough time for that. And remember, someone else has to take care of it first . They will find out. All we have to do is find someone who never finds out. And the first place we look for it is our own organization. Well, the point, Miss Grant, is so much for the housing estate project. It can not be! I'm sorry, but our time will be completely occupied by a couple of construction sites in Florida. But, Mr. Richmond, those people are counting on him. I understand... Of course, if there was someone we could trust, to whom we could give the whole thing. Not true? Such a construction requires aptitude. Someone who has wit, open, energetic, has leadership ... and one that those home buyers also trust. And I just don’t know anyone who would fit this description. Do you know me, Miss Grant? What about ... me? Sleep, Miss Grant? You yourself said Mr. Willecombe oversees the ongoing construction. And Mr. Kilcoyne does the bookkeeping. I know I could do it. I 'm sure you would go, Mr. Richmond. Please just give it a chance! Yes, yes it is. Well, I'll talk to my peers. All right. As you manage your investment, we don’t even have to keep fake accounts. - Complete success! - One moment, one moment. This should be an important decision considering that this is a risky project. "Alcatraz projekt". "Good luck, Miss Grant." - Here? - Good luck with the project. - Oh thank you. Help! Help! Stop it! - Stop! - Stop it! Come on, you can't sleep under it, dig it down! Come on, dig further! Hurry up! Hurry up there too! Stop, boys! I feel something on top. Call a doctor! Call the ambulance! Bring a resuscitator! Hurry before you drown! They found my boots! Would you pick up the other one, too? Thanks. They shouldn't have made such a fuss . There is another couple in the office. No problem, Miss Grant. Come on. Good morning, Mr. Roberts. Too busy to wish you a good morning. Well, here we are. There's Ginny and there's yours, Ruth and this is Helen's. - Isn't it exciting? - I can't wait to finish. Home Sweet Home! It will be there. I didn't think it would be that small. It only seems small now that the walls are being pulled up and you will be surprised. This is the bedroom. - The bedroom? - Aha. - Not all my stuff will fit in here. - No? I thought it would be much bigger than that. - How big would you like? - Well, let's just ... My kitchen is terribly small, Ellen. Ellen, my bathroom is so tiny. Charlie won't like it in the slightest. Luckily we came out before the foundation . Otherwise it would have been too late. - What size bedroom do you want? - Well, about ... - Touch by now. - Okay, I'll be right there. We have plenty of string. Keep it there. - Here? - Yes. - So what is it like? - Oh, great. Is that all you need to do? Of course. They put the foundation where the string is. But I'll ask Mr. Willecombe tomorrow, just to be sure. Let's go, enlarge your bathroom. Isn't it wonderful? You can design your own house. We are lucky. If the houses had already been rebuilt , we would not have been able to change our minds. Change it the way you want. Our motto will be ... "Our goal is to please the housewives." - But it could be a mistake. - For sure! - Hello, how are things? - No way. "But how could it be spoiled?" - Come on, I'll show you. I can’t even imagine this happening in this terrain. It was the most pulling job I have ever had. - It's going to hurt you a lot. - I don't know where we could have made a mistake. With my many years of experience , I have never seen anything like it. I can't comprehend. I can't comprehend. - I'll give up, what are we building? - I wish I knew. Of course, the architect himself can do what he wants. We pulled up the living room of the Smith House to overlap with the Larkin's bathroom. I really hope you are all good friends, because Mr. Larkin is going to shave in Mr. Meyers' living room. And Meyers' kitchen, it's completely gone. But maybe they'll cook in their bedroom, that's big enough ... and closes the whole path. Clever idea, fast food in the bedroom. This is an impossibility! Why did you follow my plan? You draw the lines yourself, we follow them. Oh, welcome, Mr. Richmond. How am I doing? It seems planned, Miss Grant. Thanks. Mr. Willecombe would like to talk to you about a couple of different ... I could have known. Miss Grant ... did you move those lines? Those strings? Well, yes, but I wanted to ask for your consent. I didn’t expect the cement to be poured so quickly. Quick and hard, Miss Grant. You need to get a few people to break them down. The three days of work, I can’t do without anyone, so they’re just enough. I'll do it, it's my fault. I'll break it down, just show me how. Then you can start gnashing your teeth, Miss Grant. - Do you have it? - Yes. Exactly 50 thousand. Who will tell "Miss Mindenes" about house building? He'll find out. But you have to send the timber. There are 60 carpenters sitting here just waiting for that. Next week? That's exactly what he said last week. Well no...? Hallo? Hallo? This Roscoe Johnson bought all the bricks and timber in town. This is a clear malice. Of course, it’s always hard to deal with competition. - What do we do with the carpenters? - Let's send them. - And the masons? - Let's send them. "All right, but you can't call them back if they need them." - Then stay. "If you don't pay, they won't work, Ellen." - Then we'll send them. - Please change your mind. - I do not know. "Miss Grant, what about the barbecue places?" - What's with them? - We need to level the ground in time. - Then make up. We cannot level the ground until there is a retaining wall. Then take it! Miss Grant, retaining walls can't be taken, we're building from cement. - Oh, I know we don't have cement. - We're full of cement. - There's just no one to stir. "Johnson hired them for his apartment house." See if we have cement but no mixer. The carpenters are idle. Why don't we mix the cement with the carpenters ? Miss Grant, I wouldn't have suggested that! Hallo? I am. What? I'll call you back. They called from the bank, we exceeded our credit line. Have we exceeded it? Then you have to stop working. - But we can't stop working. - Ellen, people have to be paid. But you said you made a budget for the money we got. I also expected I didn't understand myself. It seems impossible that we have spent so much. We had a couple of bad luck, lack of building materials and Johnson. But it all came out the way I estimated it. Yet it did not come out the way you appreciated it. I calculated everything, I couldn’t be so wrong. There may be something wrong with the accounting. Let's go over to the office and take a look. - All right, I'll change. - I'm waiting outside. - Well, it's okay with accounting. - What do we do? I do not know. The bank won’t lend a single penny to scatter. "What's going on here, Miss Grant?" - We just reviewed the accounting. I saw the light ... I was amazed. - Is something wrong? - Not with accounting, with the project. We ran out of money. Well, as things went, I thought it was going to happen. And the people whose entire wealth was invested in those homes. Maybe we could get more money from them. They have no more money. Complete bankruptcy. Is there nothing you can do? I wish I had. I better take it home. - I'll take you, Willecombe. - All right. I'm sorry, Mr. Richmond, I let you down , too. Don't worry about me. I think I was simply not born an administrator. I'm glad. We tried to do a good thing, but it didn’t come together. It will be hard to tell the news to those people. We just have to face it. It doesn’t sound nearly as difficult when you say “we”. You better go to bed to sleep. - Good night. - Good night. Work stopped! Ellen, she would never have stopped working. - Those filthy criminals! "We'll teach them to moor!" - Isn't that the little woman out there? - Of course not, he barely works. Look what this fuss is about. Listen, take this money to Peggy. I promised him today. He is not. This is your business, you do it. - What is that? - Isn't that illegal in this state? You mean we can not have been more popular here? Guys, we better sneak out the back door. No, no, no, wait. We better face it. Silence, silence, people! Quiet! Let me talk. I ... I know how they feel, but ... there's nothing to do. - You could give us our money back. - Yes! A moment. The money was all spent. I'm sorry, let me through. Just so you know, Mr. Richmond. I'm a lawyer. And I’m saying I’m going to do everything I can to put you and your cheating friends in jail. Stop it! A moment. Stop it please! The wrong person is being attacked. This is not Mr. Richmond's fault, but mine, entirely. He didn't want to continue investing, but I begged him and I begged him to entrust me with the management of things. I thought I could help my friends, but ... with the upheaval I did, I did more harm to them. We can’t fix a few things anymore, but I made every mistake. And because of these, our houses will not be rebuilt. Or give us our money back. We trusted you, Ellen and Judge Grant himself. - You're right, Ellen. - I'm fully aware of that. Mrs. Grant and I decided to sell our house. This will allow us to repay at least part of their loss . You see, when I cause trouble, I cause discomfort to everyone. Well, I think I'm going back to court. If you forgive me, I go and buy some good alcohol. Drink or alcohol? Alcohol. I also buy a good alcohol with you. I thought we were going to take responsibility. I couldn't let you get involved, Dick. He recently came to this city. We also need to think about the future. That's right, isn't it, Dick? Again. Relax, Dick, you 're still tired. I think I'd be nervous too, if were preparing to get rid of $ 50,000. You're about to get rid of it, aren't you? - Yes. "You never postponed a deal, Dick." Peggy, you said you forgot that horse when I got back into your body. Is the offer still standing? Of course, I couldn't come back right away, I have to do a few deals, but as soon as things are resolved ... What effect will this have on "Miss Diligent"? - Can't you forget about it? - But can you? - There's nothing to forget. - Good. You and I are similar, Dick. I have never delayed settling a case either . 48, 49 and 50 thousand. All right, work can continue. - I can not accept. - It does not accept it? - What's wrong with him? "Dick, I know you didn't get that money easily." And even if I did things better ... Work is left behind and Johnson buys all the raw materials for the city. I think he would just throw the money out the window again . So Johnson does that, huh? Well, I think everything is in free love and business. What do you think about this? We have to fight for bricks. It’s as hard as teasing a horse race. We have dealt with a similar situation before and it will be a pleasure to deal with another one. Let's go. Maga is, Miss Grant. I trust you. Do you think it will work? If you will remember what you have to say. Mr. Johnson? Well, well ... The cheap housing estate is an expert. Mr. Johnson, I want to talk to you. Well, it doesn't cost anything. Your device is there. Here, use this. But, Mr. Johnson, it is an inability to use all the building materials you have purchased. Maybe ... but I'll tell you what terms I'm willing to sell you. - Are you okay? - Of course. Help! Help! Somebody help! Help! What's going on? This cement mixer almost killed this man. Who is the leader here? - I am. - You'll pay for it. This is a crime committed through negligence. It's just an accident. Damn the accident! I saw how it happened, I was the only one. - Help me, I'll take you to the doctor. - One moment, one moment. I'll take you to the hospital. Help me, sir. Thanks. All right, back to work, people! Back to work! She'll be fine. Don't worry, Mr. Johnson, I just saw it. - It was an accident, wasn't it? - I was just standing in front of the window ... and I told you about the things I needed ... about wood, brick and plumbing parts ... This is not interesting. It wasn’t a crime of negligence , was it? If I had to testify, the man's word would be against Judge Grant's niece's word. I'd believe you in a minute. And you're going to say there was no negligence, right? Well, let's see. After I told you what I needed, he said ... What did you say, Mr. Johnson? - Miss Grant ... - What is it? If you think you can blackmail ... I wonder if that poor man could have been . What would a judge's niece not do ? Do you still think you have a job left? Lagging behind? I do not understand. I have never seen work done so fast. It’s not work anymore, it’s competition. - Race? What do you mean by that? - Look. If you put another $ 20 into work, just try to stop them. CEREMONIAL TAPE CUTTER OPENING TODAY Yes? Yes, this is Dick Richmond's office. Who do you want to pass 20 on? About "Jingle Bells"? There is no money with that name. He must have called the wrong number. Again? Want to make $ 50 for a "Blue Medal"? That doesn’t seem like much for an entire pendant. But I'll tell Mr. Richmond. A bet? Yes. Yes, I definitely understand. All right, how much do you want to ask? Yes, I will. Is there a message, Miss Grant? Sam wants to move 20 to "Mumbley Peg," fifth in Belmount. Sam is a bad guesser. I got along great with him. - I'm sorry, Ellen. - What? Everything went well, didn't it? He wanted someone who had wit, open, energetic, had leadership. I just got the job right. A minute ago, I thought "Mumbley Peg" was a breeze. What will you do? Are you calling the district attorney? - No. - Why not? Because that would hurt my uncle. He cheated Judge Grant ... a bookmaker. Well, you don't have to worry about the bookmaker anymore . I'm leaving town. Where is he going? Floridába. Why? I'm not going to tell anyone ... about your business. I'm going with Peggy Donato. Peggy... That's right. We are opening a new office in the south. Then everything you told me ... it was all part of the looks. Like a real estate business. Not exactly. I played outside my weight class. I made a mistake so I got out of it. I understand. I have a little business in town. Goodbye, Mr. Richmond. It was a great experience to get to know yourself. When you select your next secretary, hand over my honor. Hey, what's up? Miss Grant finally realized what good internal phones were. Will you tell the cops? He doesn't want to embarrass his uncle. Thanks for our loyalty. - Are you feeling well? "Of course, they're just crumbs of joy." Look, Miss Grant, don't be mad. He did it all for his own sake. Even Gleason and I were thinking about getting into business. Real estate, come on! A little effort and bookmakers already look like cash sharks. And legally. Look, Miss Grant, Dick didn't let you down. He even stood up to Peggy Donato. Well, he's a criminal. I know everything, the horses, Peggy, Florida, everything. Well, things went smoothly. The housing estate gave itself to him in exchange for the 50,000 he received for a construction bump . - Is that how you got the money? - He owed it. Because of the "Flywell" message you forgot to pass. Yes, that's how he paid him to stay in the store. - In the shop? - Yes, in the bookmaker's syndicate. Peggy and the boys only know this business. It always pays off. Well, it looks like I went to bad business school. - We could have a drink before the trip. "I thought you wanted to hurry to get to Florida." I have to wait for the boys with the West Coast revenue. Gim, Louis, Finger. You crossed my organization, huh? You captured my buddy, my most important man. You're in trouble, bro. - Listen, Ellen, I made a deal ... - Shut up, you rat! So you're trying to trick me with this kitty, huh? What's all this? You said she was just a secretary. Just a secretary? So that's how we stand? - Please, Ellen, you can only get in trouble ... - Are you trying to threaten me? Look, sister, you go without the tree head or you don't go at all. So what? I paid him 50,000. All right, boys, let's teach you more. Wait a minute. That was a year ago. Well now I'll recall again. Ellen, for heaven's sake ... All right, boys, what are we waiting for? No no no. That’s not the way things should be done when all the cops in town are looking for us. After all, he’s not the only important person in the business, he has a lot of good salespeople. I thought your mind would come. It's always like that when you "run out of chips." - Ellen, you don't even have chips ... - I'll take care of you later. And if you try to cut through it again, you’ll end up in a tight corset. Give me a fire, Gim. The gun, smart. Thanks, Ellen, I was trying to tell you this wasn't going to end well. Throw them out! Hi everyone. What is the subject of the debate? No debate. Mr. Richmond and I have just settled our finances. Oh, that? That was done. Mr. Richmond has no debt to you, Mrs. Donato. What? That’s right, we put 5,000 on a horse that won with one nose. That's $ 50,000. $ 5,000? Themselves? I do not believe it. That's right, we made the money for you. - Ask him. - That's what happened, Peg. What dirty thing did they manage to pay for their loss? Dirty thing? But Peg, we didn't ask back when you won with us. It's the same thing. The boys thought you would appreciate it if they did business with your methods. And you know the ethics of our profession, Peg. Yes. My weapon, please. Glamorous, kitten. Let's get out of this place. Oh, my dignity. Kilcoyne, how did you know that horse was going to win? Either Einstein would have figured it out. By the way, a guy told me the race was greased down. So I said, "Gleason, put five to number four in the sixth race." The foursome in the sixth race? But I put it in number six in the fourth. We won, but it was "Unkaticoyle". - Not "Prince Hal"? - "Prince Fish" pumpkin was last. Give him a breath! Give him a breath! Oh, she'll be fine. "Prince Hal"?
