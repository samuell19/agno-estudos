IT'S LIKE LIVING IN MISSION CONTROL. - AH, IT'S GETTING ON... - COME ON LET ME GET YOU TO BED. - JARVIS, HONEY, I KNOW WE GOT TO GET GOING. BUT I THINK IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO. - IT'S REALLY OKAY, PEPPER. I'M USED TO DEALING WITH THIS. - ALICE, IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T LEARN SOMETHING NEW. - THERE'S A LOT MORE SALT TO THAT PEPPER THAN MEETS THE EYE. NOT THAT WHAT MEETS THE EYE IS ALL THAT BAD. - [laughs] - WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK, JARVIS? - I'M FINE. - I KNOW YOU'RE FINE. BUT ARE YOU LOOSE? GO TO VEGAS WITH A GIRL LIKE THAT, YOU GOT TO BE WILLING TO ROLL THE DICE, RIGHT? COME ON, JARVIS, THE LADIES ARE GOING TO BE UP THERE FOR A LONG TIME. IF I KNOW MY WIFE, SOMETIMES IT TAKES ALICE ALL NIGHT. YOU THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH MY MARRIAGE? SHE SLEEPS MORE WITH OUR SON THAN SHE DOES WITH ME? - I WOULDN'T KNOW. - NO, MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T. YOU EVER BEEN MARRIED, JARVIS? - ONCE. - YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED? SHE RUN OFF WITH A YOUNG RODEO RIDER? - NO, WE WERE TOGETHER TILL THE DAY SHE DIED. - SORRY. - HOW COULD YOU BE? YOU NEVER MET HER. - HOW ABOUT SOME BOURBON? YOU SOUTHERN BOYS LIKE BOURBON. - WHY I'M FROM TEXAS. - I STAND CORRECTED. YOU TEXAS BOYS LIKE BOURBON. - ON THE RIGHT OCCASION. - WELL, DO YOU CONSIDER THIS THE RIGHT OCCASION? - AH, ABOUT AS RIGHT AS IT'S GONNA GET. NICE BIG YARD. YOU EVER THINK OF PUTTING IN A POOL? - WHAT YOU THINK I CAN'T AFFORD IT? - AH, I NEVER SAID THAT. MOST FOLKS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE POOLS IS ALL. - IF WE WANTED A POOL, WE'D HAVE A POOL. ANDY NEEDS THE GRASS FOR EXERCISE. - I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH YOU. A GROWING BOY NEEDS ROOM TO GRAZE. [smacks lips] - SO, JARVIS, PRETTY IMPRESSIVE PICKING UP YOUNG GIRLS IN GAS STATIONS. - YOU GET DONE WHAT NEEDS TO GET DONE TILL THE GOOD LORD GETS DONE WITH YOU. - [laughs] I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I COULD DO IT ANYMORE. ALL THE RIGHT MOVES AND... YOU'RE PRETTY SMOOTH THOUGH. YOU GOT THAT "AW SHUCKS" THING DOWN TO AN ART. [laughs] - YOU ALWAYS THIS PISSED OFF AT THE WORLD? - I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I HAD A BAD MORNING. YOU KNOW, ARGUMENT WITH THE WIFE. NO COMMUNICATION WITH THE SON. AIRPLANE CRASHING THROUGH THE ROOF. YOU KNOW, JUST ONE OF THOSE DAYS. - IT COULD HAVE BEEN A HELL OF A LOT WORSE. IN FACT, FROM WHERE I'M STANDING, SO COULD YOUR LIFE. - FROM WHERE YOU'RE STANDING, YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE MY LIFE. - GRANDMA MOODY USED TO SAY "IF YOU HAVE TO LOOK OVER YOUR FENCE TO SEE YOURSELF, "YOU BEST MOVE." - WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? YOU SPOUT ALL THESE HOMILIES FROM YOUR GRANDMA AND YOUR GREAT GRANDPAPPY LIKE IT WAS THE GOSPEL. - WELL, WE ALL NEED WORDS TO LIVE BY. - WHO'S IN THERE, JARVIS? DO YOU EVER GET MAD? DO YOU EVEN SWEAT? ARE YOU FUCKING HUMAN? - WELL, HOWEVER LONG I'M STUCK HERE I WOULD EXPECT YOU TO BEHAVE LIKE A GENTLEMAN. AND I WILL DO MY DAMNEDEST TO DO THE SAME. - TEACH ME TO DANCE. - [snorts laughter] WHAT? - COME ON. JARVIS, AS LONG AS YOU'RE STUCK HERE, YOU MIGHT AS WELL DO SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE. - YOU ARE ONE CRAZY SON OF A BITCH. - YOU SMASHED THROUGH MY ROOF, AND I'M NOT GONNA SUE YOU. I'M JUST ASKING FOR A LITTLE INSTRUCTION HERE. I SAW YOU WITH PEPPER. YOU'RE REALLY SMOOTH. WHAT'S THAT COWBOY DANCE THING YOU GUYS ALWAYS DO? WHAT'S THAT CALLED? - THE TWO STEP. - WELL, SEE THAT'S PERFECT. ALICE IS ALWAYS COMPLAINING ABOUT ME NOT KNOWING THE STEPS. IF THEY'RE ONLY TWO, MAYBE I CAN LEARN 'EM. - YOU ARE DUMBER THAN A ROOSTER'S I.Q. - I KNOW I CAN BE A PRICK SOMETIMES. I KNOW. I'M SORRY. PLEASE. COME ON. TEACH ME HOW TO DANCE. MAYBE IT WILL SAVE MY MARRIAGE. - FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN, YOU NEED A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN A FEW DANCE STEPS. FIRST THING, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE RIGHT MUSIC. - SOMETHING COUNTRY, RIGHT? - [laughs] WHY, DONALD... YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING OUT ON ME. - YEAH, WE ALL GOT A LITTLE COWBOY IN US. - NO WONDER YOU HAD A BAD DREAM, HONEY. YOU GOT TOO FRUSTRATED BEFORE BED. SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR DADDY AND ME TO HELP YOU WITH THIS. - WELL, AT LEAST HE TRIED. - PEPPER, I KNOW WHAT MY SON CAN AND CAN'T DO. - I'M SURE YOU DO, ALICE. IT'S JUST THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET SO CLOSE TO SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T SEE IT. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE BEES. - IT'S TREES, AND THAT'S NOT THE POINT. - WHATEVER. EW! WHAT'S THIS? - OH, THAT'S A POSTER THAT WE GOT HIM AT A SWAP MEET. IT WAS AFTER... ANDY WAS ALMOST 5. HE HAD TO HAVE IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO FRIGHTENING, BUT DONALD THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY. - ANDY, NO WONDER YOU HAVE NIGHTMARES. I MEAN, ALL THOSE GREEN GUYS ARE SCARY. - HE STARES AT IT A LOT. SOMETIMES I THINK HE TALKS TO THEM. - WHAT DO YOU SAY TO 'EM, ANDY? - [groaning] - IT'S OKAY, ANDY. COME ON. TELL ME WHAT YOU SAY TO 'EM. - AH. [groaning] - THIS ISN'T WORKING, PEPPER. WE NEED TO CALM HIM DOWN BEFORE BED. NOT OVERSTIMULATE HIM. COME ON, HONEY. LET'S GET IN BED. TIME TO GO TO SLEEP. - I'M SORRY. JUST TRYING TO HELP. - I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP, BUT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. AND I KNOW WHAT WORKS. IN YOU GO. OKAY, JUST SHUT YOUR EYES. [sighs] OKAY, SWEETIE. RELAX. EVERYTHING'S OKAY. - I LOVE FOOT MASSAGES. - ACUPRESSURE POINTS. SHUT YOUR EYES, SWEETIE. PEPPER, THIS ISN'T HELPING. - LOOKS PRETTY RELAXED TO ME. - OKAY, JUST BREATHE, AND LET ALL THAT ENERGY OUT. JUST LISTEN TO THE CALMING SOUNDS, AND LET THEM FLOW THROUGH YOUR BODY. [sniffs] [blows] [blows] AND LET THEM CARRY AWAY ALL THAT ENERGY. [synthesizer pulse] - OH, WOW. [laughs] THERE WAS THIS ONE DANCE THAT I USED TO DO AT THE CLUB. MM. YOU KNOW THAT SONG "SEXUAL HEALING"? - CLOSE YOUR EYES. [blows] COME ON, ANDY. CONCENTRATE. [blows] JUST RELAX. - [breathing heavily] - ANDY! - ALICE... IT'S OKAY.

I USED TO BOX IN COLLEGE. - OH YEAH? WHERE? - UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN. - REALLY? - NEVER PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO IT. IT WAS JUST A WAY TO KEEP IN SHAPE. - SO I GUESS IF YOU'RE BORN INTO A FAMILY FORTUNE YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE TOO MUCH SERIOUSLY. - UH-HUH. - HEY LISTEN, UH, MAYBE WE COULD THROW A FEW LATER ON. YOU KNOW, SPAR AROUND A LITTLE. - IT WAS SO MANY YEARS I'M NOT SURE I REMEMBER WHICH HAND THE GLOVES GO ON. - COME ON. SOME THINGS YOU NEVER FORGET. - [laughs] - [sighs] I LOOK AWFUL. - NO, YOU DON'T. - PEPPER. - WELL, MAYBE YOU LOOK JUST A LITTLE BIT WORN OUT. BUT, ALICE, YOU'RE REALLY A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. - THANKS, THAT'S VERY CHARITABLE. - OH, NO, THAT'S NOT CHARITY. IT'S JUST HONEST. [trickling] - [sighs] OH, COME ON, SKIN. LOOK YOUNG AND TIGHT LIKE YOU USED TO. - YOU KNOW... [toilet flushes] I USED TO WORK AT THE SALON IN DEL MAR WHERE THEY DID FACIALS AND STUFF. - YEAH? - YEAH. AND, UM, WE USED TO PUT ALL THIS AVOCADO AND SEAWEED JUNK ON THESE RICH LADIES. - REALLY? - NEVER WORKED. [sighs] - GREAT. - [sighs] HEY, YOU HAVE A BRUSH I COULD BORROW? - OH YEAH. RIGHT HERE. [clattering] - THANKS. [sighs] - I USED TO HAVE HAIR LIKE THAT. - OH YEAH? YOU HAD SKUNK STRIPES? - NO, BUT IT WAS LONG. - HMM. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I LOVE BEST ABOUT HAVING LONG HAIR? IS THE WAY A GUY CAN JUST RUN HIS FINGERS THROUGH IT. - WELL.... [sighs] THE ONLY MAN WHO RUNS HIS FINGERS THROUGH MY HAIR THESE DAYS IS RUDOLFO WHILE HE'S CUTTING IT. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - [sighs] - YOU AND DONALD DON'T DO IT? - LATELY, I GO TO THE PERIODONTIST MORE. - OH MY GOD. WHAT... I MEAN, I HEARD THAT ABOUT MARRIED PEOPLE. I JUST-- WELL, I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. I'VE NEVER BEEN AROUND 'EM THAT MUCH. NONE OF MY PARENTS WERE EVER MARRIED. - [sighs] LIFE HAS A WAY OF DRAINING THE ROMANCE OUT OF YOU. - THAT IS SO SAD. - OH, THAT'S A GREAT COLOR. I WISH I COULD GET AWAY WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT. - WHY CAN'T YOU? - I'M A LOT OLDER THAN YOU, PEPPER. - YEAH, BUT YOU STILL HAVE LIPS. YOU KNOW, ALICE, I USED TO BE A MAKEUP CONSULTANT, AND YOUR LIPSTICK IS THE BILLBOARD TO YOUR SEXUALITY. - YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF JOBS. - YEAH. WELL, SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT THINK I'M SO SMART. BUT I DO KNOW ABOUT SOME STUFF. [smacks lips] AND ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW ABOUT IS LOVE. I'M KIND OF LIKE A TELEVISION SET THAT PICKS UP PICTURES BETWEEN PEOPLE. AND WHAT I SEE HERE IS A LOT OF LOVE GETTING MESSED UP BY A LOT OF STATIC. AND, ALICE, I KNOW IT MAY BE SCARY SOMETIMES, BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU'VE GOT TO CLIMB UP ON THAT ROOF AND FIX THE OLD SATELLITE DISH. - YOU KNOW, PEPPER, WHOEVER TOLD YOU YOU WEREN'T SMART WAS STUPID. [clinking] [hissing] - HERE YOU GO. - MUCH OBLIGED. - MY PLEASURE. [microwave dings] - SO, JARVIS... WHAT DO YOU THINK GRANDMA MOODY WOULD SAY ABOUT ONE OF THESE THINGS? - SHE'D SAY NOBODY CAN WAIT FOR NOTHING NO MORE. - WELL, THEN SHE'D BE RIGHT. - WHAT DO YOU SAY WE BARBECUE THEM BABIES? - BARBECUE? - THE FLAVOR OF A STEAK OVER AN OPEN FLAME. YOU GOT ONE IN THE BACKYARD, DON'T YOU? - YEAH. WE JUST DON'T USE IT VERY MUCH. [microwave motor humming] - THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL. - I TOOK THAT ON OUR HONEYMOON. - YOU TOOK IT? YOU MEAN, WITH YOUR CAMERA? - YEAH, PHOTOGRAPHY USED TO BE SORT OF A HOBBY OF MINE. - WELL, IT SURE LOOKS REAL PROFESSIONAL TO ME. I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE I'M THERE. - IT WAS A REALLY NICE PLACE TO BE. [sighs] MAYBE I NEED A BOOB JOB. OR A TUMMY TUCK OR AN ASS LIFT. I USED TO HAVE A GREAT ASS. - YOU KNOW, I ALMOST GOT A BOOB JOB ONCE. - REALLY? - YEAH. THIS GUY I USED TO DANCE FOR-- OOF! WHAT A PIG HE WAS. ANYWAY, HE TOLD ME I COULD HEADLINE IF I WAS JUST A COUPLE SIZES BIGGER. - AND WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM? - WELL, I TOLD HIM IF HE WAS READY TO GET SOME SILICONE INJECTED INTO HIS DICK THAT I WOULD DO IT. [laughs] - HE MUST HAVE LOVED THAT. - OH YEAH, HE FIRED MY ASS. SO THE SAME DAY I WENT OUT, AND I GOT THIS. - "KISS MY ASS"? [laughs] WHOO! I LOVE IT! [clanking] - WHOA! - HASN'T BEEN USED IN A WHILE. [flames blowing] - IT WILL HEAT UP IN NO TIME. - YEAH. - SO, WHAT DO YOU DO, DONALD? - YOU MEAN, WHEN I'M NOT COOKING STEAKS FOR PEOPLE WHO CRASH LAND ON MY ROOF? - YEP. - I'M A CORPORATE LAWYER. IMPRESSED? - DOESN'T GET YOUR SPURS KICKING, HUH? - LATELY, I NEED SPURS TO KICK MYSELF AWAKE. THESE DAYS, THE THING I CARE ABOUT THE MOST IS SLEEP. - I'M NOT SO SURE THAT'S WHAT THE GOOD LORD HAD IN MIND WHEN HE CREATED THE WORLD. - YOUR WORLD AND MY WORLD ARE 2 ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PLACES. I USED TO CARE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. [sizzling] - FASTER, DADDY! FASTER! FASTER, DADDY, FASTER! - ARMS UP! ARMS UP! OKAY, COME ON, ANDY. MOVE THROUGH THE BLUE. THAT'S IT. - MOVE INTO THE BLUE. - COME ON, KICK. KICK. USE YOUR ARMS. USE YOUR ARMS. COME ON, ANDY. USE YOUR HANDS. REMEMBER HOW I TAUGHT YOU? THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. THAT A BOY. SWIM WITH YOUR HANDS. [splashing] USE YOUR HANDS, ANDY, LIKE I TOLD YOU. THAT A BOY. MOVING THROUGH THE BLUE. LOOK AT THIS! - YOU'RE DOING GREAT! OH, THAT'S GOOD, ANDY. - LOOK AT HIM! - THAT'S GREAT! - LOOK AT HIM GO. KEEP THOSE ARMS GOING. HE'S MY OLYMPIC SWIMMER. [laughs] - SMILE! LOOK AT MOMMY. ANDY, ARE YOU GONNA BE MOMMY'S CHAMPION? - NO, HE'S GOING TO BE DADDY'S CHAMPION. - I WANT TO BE MOMMY AND DADDY'S CHAMPION. - [laughs] - GOOD ANSWER. - HOW HIGH CAN YOU GO? [laughs] - GOOD! - [laughs] - HERE, LET'S TAKE A PICTURE. - OKAY, TURN AND LOOK AT ME, BABY. - HERE WE GO. WHOO! - AH, THAT'S A BEAUTY. - OH, MY GREAT GRANDDADDY ALWAYS USED TO SAY "IT'S A LUCKY MAN WHO LOOKS FORWARD TO "GOING TO WORK IN THE MORNING. "AND AN EVEN LUCKIER ONE WHO LOOKS FORWARD TO GOING HOME." - WHAT WOULD YOUR GREAT GRANDDADDY SAY ABOUT A MAN WHO DOESN'T DO EITHER? - [smacks lips] HE'D FEEL DOWNRIGHT SAD FOR THAT MAN. BUT HE'D ALSO SAY THERE AIN'T NO REASON TO FEE SAD FOR A MAN WHO FEELS THAT SAD FOR HIMSELF. - WHAT DO YOU THINK? - I WORE THIS FOR MY FIRST DAY AS A CLERK FOR THE PUBLIC DEFENDER...WITH A BLAZER. - OH, WELL, I HOPE YOUR BOSS APPRECIATED IT. - [sighs] WE LOST THE CASE. - JUSTICE IS BLIND. - BUT I MET DONALD. - LOVE IS NOT. - YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS ONE IS TOO BORING. - OH, YEAH. ALICE, I THINK THIS IS THE ONE. - I WILL NEVER GET THIS ON. - I PROMISE YOU ONE THING-- IF YOU GET THIS ON, YOU WILL GET IT ON. COME ON! PUT IT ON! [giggling] - WHAT ARE YOU BOYS DOING OUT HERE? - WELL, WELL, WELL! STEP RIGHT THIS WAY, DARLINGS. - YOU'RE BARBECUING. - JARVIS SAID THEY TASTE BETTER, AND HE'S THE GUEST. - WELL, I'M AMAZED THIS THING STILL WORKS. - JUST NEEDED A LITTLE TENDER LOVING CARE. - WELL, DON'T WE ALL. - I REMEMBER YOU. - IT'S NICE TO BE REMEMBERED. [clinking] - MMM. FABULOUS. - THIS IS SO GOOD. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THERE'S LIKE THIS PERFECT MOMENT WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND THE RIGHT PLACE. - AND THE RIGHT FOOD. WHY IS IT THAT THE THINGS THAT ARE THE WORST FOR US ALWAYS TASTE THE BEST? - ASKED ADAM TO EVE. - OH, WELL, SEE THERE'S A STORY THAT I NEVER BELIEVED. I MEAN, IF GOD DIDN'T WANT THEM TO EAT THE APPLE, WHY WOULD HAVE MADE A TREE GROW FRUIT? - PEPPER, YOU'RE A THEOLOGIAN. - WELL, THESE DAYS THEY WOULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED ANYWAY. TOO MANY PESTICIDES ON THE APPLE. - WELL, I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IN FEELING GUILTY ABOUT WHAT FEELS GOOD. - AS GRANDMA MOODY ALWAYS USED TO SAY "AN OCCASIONAL ANYTHING WON'T KILL YOU, "UNLESS IT'S AN OCCASIONAL BULLET TO THE HEAD." [all laugh] - WANT TO KNOW WHAT ELSE BUGS ME? - WHAT? - SUN. - EXCUSE ME? - WELL, THE SUN. BECAUSE, SEE, THE SUN WILL SHINE DOWN ON PLACES LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, ETHIOPIA, RIGHT, WHERE IT'S ALL DRY AND CRACKED, AND IT DOESN'T GROW FOOD ANYWHERE, AND PEOPLE ARE STARVING AND DYING. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE SUN SHINES DOWN ON A PLACE LIKE HAWAII WHERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING SUN TANS AND DRINKING MAI TAIS. IT JUST, WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR. IT'S THE SAME SUN. - THE SAME SUN. - [laughs] - [smacks lips] - [clanking] [growling] [all laughing] - HAIL TO THE CHEF. - OH, NO, NO, NO. I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT THE BRILLIANT ASSISTANCE OF GRANDMA MOODY'S FAVORITE DISCIPLE JARVIS. - IT WAS NOTHING. - OH, BUNNY, NOW I WANT YOU TO STOP THAT, OKAY. [sighs] HE ALWAYS DOES THIS. HE NEVER TAKES CREDIT FOR ANYTHING. HIS COMPANY, IT'S LIKE ON TOP OF THAT LIST. YOU KNOW, UM, OH, THE BUSINESS LIST. THE MAGAZINE? - FORTUNE 500. - YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE. WELL, HE NEVER TAKES CREDIT FOR IT. HE THINKS HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. - WELL, BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME BEFORE I GOT HERE, AND IT WILL BE AROUND A LONG TIME AFTER I'M GONE. - SO, IN OTHER WORDS, YOU DON'T MATTER AT ALL? - I DIDN'T SAY THAT. - YOU DIDN'T NEED TO. COME ON, JARVIS. IN MOST GUYS, HUMILITY IS A VIRTUE. IN YOU, IT'S ARMOR. - ARE WE GONNA EAT, OR WE GONNA GET ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL HERE? - YOU KNOW, I THINK DONALD'S RIGHT. I MEAN, YOU RUN WHAT SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THE BIGGEST INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY. - MORE LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD. - AND YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A LEMONADE STAND. - WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE HE DOESN'T FEEL HE EARNED IT, RIGHT? BUT YOU DID EARN IT, BUNNY. YOU DID. BEING BORN INTO IT, LIVING IT-- THAT'S EARNING IT. - HOW ABOUT THAT SPARRING MATCH? - NOW? WE'RE EATING. - YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT A HALF AN HOUR. - WELL, THAT'S SWIMMING. - WHAT'S SPARRING? [punches] [grunting] - CHARMING, HUH? - NOW WHY WOULD TWO GROWN MEN WHO LIKE EACH OTHER WANT TO BEAT EACH OTHER TO A PULP? - BECAUSE THEY CAN'T HAVE BABIES. [grunting] - OOH! AHH! - YOU KNOW, ALICE, DONALD'S IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. - HE GIVES NEW MEANING TO OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR. - YEAH, WELL, YOU HAVE YOUR GOOD OBSESSIONS AND YOUR BAD OBSESSIONS. - AH! - JARVIS DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD HIMSELF. - YOU HEAR THAT, BUNNY? ALICE THINKS YOU'RE A HUNK! [laughs] - OOH! [grunting] [hard punch] - OOH! - OH! - OH, DONALD WANTS TO MAKE SURE THIS BROKEN DOWN COWBOY NEVER RIDES AGAIN! - NO, I JUST WANT TO SEE IF THAT INSURANCE OF YOURS PAYS OFF. [punch] - OOH! [heavy breathing] - I HAVEN'T HAD THIS MUCH FUN SINCE COLLEGE. - WELL, FINE. I WON'T TAKE THAT PERSONALLY. [heavy breathing] - WANT A JOB, DONALD? - WHAT? - A JOB! ANY LAWYER WITH FOOTWORK LIKE YOURS, I WANT ON MY SIDE. - ARE YOU SERIOUS? - SERIOUS AS A BULL IN A CHUTE. [hard punch] - OOH! - OUCH! - WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? - BECAUSE I CAN. [punch] - OH! GOD! - HELL OF AN INTERVIEW PROCESS, JARVIS. - BRAVO! [clapping] [kissing sounds] - OH! HE GOT ME. - YOU OKAY? YEAH. WELL, YOU'RE BLEEDING A LITTLE. - JESUS. ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NO LISTING IN AUSTIN, HOUSTON OR DALLAS? YEAH, OKAY, KELLY. THANKS. NO, NO. WE'RE FINE. YEAH, I WILL. WHAT DID I TELL YOU. NOT ONLY IS THERE NO NUMBER ON THE CARD, BUT KELLY SAYS THERE'S NO LISTING FOR A JARVIS MOODY OR UNIGLOBE LIFE ANYWHERE IN TEXAS. - SO? COME ON, RAGING BULL. SIT DOWN. AND I'LL FIX YOUR CUT. - [sighs] MAN. OH, MAN. I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET HIM SUCKER PUNCH ME LIKE THAT. OW! - SORRY. - I KNOW HE ONLY OFFERED ME THAT JOB TO DISTRACT ME SO HE COULD NAIL ME. - OH, DONALD, YOU WEREN'T PLAYING CHESS. YOU WERE BOXING. PEOPLE GET HIT. DON'T START GETTING PARANOID. - I JUST DON'T TRUST THE GUY, OKAY. - WELL, FINE. BUT WHOEVER THEY ARE I'M KIND OF ENJOYING MYSELF THIS EVENING. CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT. IT'S BEEN SO LONG I CAN HARDLY REMEMBER THE SENSATION. HERE. BLEEDING STOPPED. - SO I WON'T NEED THE TRANSFUSION? - PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT, MAYBE. - HAVE I TOLD YOU LATELY YOU'RE AN AMAZING PERSON? - NO.
