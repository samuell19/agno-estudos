(soft piano music) - Morning. - Morning. - [Receptionist] Mary Ann, why does he look familiar? - Oh, you must stay up late. He has that carpet store. He does those horrible commercials. You know, I'll stand on my head, give you a really good deal. - You're right. And my mother was worried about the kind of people I'd meet working at a methadone clinic. Half of these guys could run for Congress. - Think how much money we'd make if we were into blackmail. - Well, good idea, I need new carpet. - Hmm. - [Receptionist] God, he's cute. - Who's that? - Your boyfriend. - Hmm? Guy, he's just friendly. - He was never that friendly to me. - Morning, sunshine. Fascinating, reads like one of your finer Airport paperbacks. - I was checking your dosage. - Come on, you were looking at my picture. I clean up pretty nice, huh? - Are we going to lower our dosage? - Someday, you'll be the first to know. - Well, make your contribution to society. - You know, this is gonna be such a romantic story when we tell our grandkids. - Just do it. - You have never told me your name. - Maybe I like being called sunshine. It's Mary Ann. - It's perfect. - And you're from Kansas, right? - Iowa. - Same thing. Don't go away - Guy. Um, can I ask you something? - [Guy] Ask me anything. - Um, do you have a girlfriend? - No, well, I did but we broke up. Why? - Would you like to go to a movie with me sometime? - Um, is that okay, going out with a patient? - Well, I wasn't gonna put it in your chart. - Are you sure you're from Iowa? (soft music) - [Guy] Hi. - Hi. - I saw your parking. I can't let you see what a mess my place is, you'd lose all respect for me. - What made you think I had any? - Oh, sarcasm, hmm. It's my favorite thing in a woman. Come on, let's go - We have lots of time. - Yeah, well, I'm a forward moving type of guy. - You look terrific. - Thank you. - Are you one of those women who get offended if I do open the door or if I don't? - I'm not one of those women who get offended. - That's a good thing. Oh. - What? - Linda, what are you doing here? - I live here. Did he mention that? It slips his mind sometimes. - Linda, this is Mary Ann. She's a nurse at the methadone clinic. I couldn't get over there today and she was kind enough to drop my stuff off for me on her way home which I really appreciate. Did I say that? I was just seeing the lady to her car. I'll be up in a minute. - You said you didn't have a girlfriend and you're living with somebody? - I don't want to be living with her. I've been trying to break it off for months now. - Why don't you call me when you do? - No, look, I really want to go out with you. Um, let me clean this up and I'll meet you over at Lassos in a couple of hours? - Oh, I don't know. - [Guy] Come on, please - It really bothers me the way you're able to lie at a moment's notice like that. - Yeah, well, it's my one true talent so don't hold it against me. Nine o'clock? (country music) You're here. That's great. I was afraid you might not be. - I almost gave up on you. - Never give up on me. That's rule number one. I hope this place isn't too lowbrow for you. - I don't have a problem with lowbrow. It's the other end that makes me uncomfortable. - Me too. See, we're meant for each other. I'm usually going to places where I'm the only Mercedes in the parking lot. - I thought you didn't have a car? - I did til a few days ago. 450SL. Nice car till I totaled it. - What happened? - Some guy cut me off on the freeway. I thought it was really rude so I rammed him. I guess I wasn't thinking too clearly at the time. I was in no mood to deal with the cops so I just got out and took off. - You just left it? - Hey, you don't think I ended up in a methadone clinic because I'm a sane person? - No, I don't suppose you did. I don't suppose you did. - This is your daughter? - [Mary Ann] Yeah, that's Jenny. - She's cute. You think she's too old for me? - Oh, I think you're probably about the same age. - Yeah, yeah, talk tough. You like me? - Do I? - I don't know. Do you? - Yeah. Don't let it go to your head. - No, just making sure you're not after me for my money. - Oh. - Ho, ho. What's so funny? I own the biggest clothing store in Vegas. - You're losing the largest clothing store in Vegas. - Yeah, well, if you want to get technical about it. - [Mary Ann] Oh, you sure find it amusing. - I'm in a program. What else do you want from me, sunshine? - You've been in the program for three years and you've never lowered your dose once. You're just substituting methadone for heroin on days you can't find your dealer. I may be from Iowa but I didn't just fall off the turnip truck, you know. - Getting late, huh. I guess I better be calling a cab. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to preach a sermon. - No, you're entitled to your opinion. (dramatic music) (gun firing) - Can we watch something-- - Shh, this is the best part! - What's so good about it? - Mary Ann, go get the potato chips. - Give me the flashlight. - [Sandra] How come the Indians never get to win? - [Boy] How can you be so stupid? - Oh no! - Right, you did it! - [Mary Anne] It was an accident. - So what we're still gonna get it! Mary Anne, don't do that! - We have to see how to get them out. - He drives by here and checks, I've seen it. - So hurry! - You guys be careful, if there's even a crumb left, Mom will see it. - You should've thought of that when you spilled 'em. - John L. I tripped. Why do you have to be such a jackass? - You swore, I'm gonna tell! - Shh! Quiet. (door slamming) (footsteps echoing) - Who turned on the light? I said who turned on the light! Okay. Every one of you is gonna get it. (belt snapping) Let's go, John L. - I did it. I won't do it again, I promise. None of my friends have to keep their lights off. - [Man] Friends don't pay my electric bills. (belt thwacking) - [Mary Ann] Stop it, stop it please! I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! I won't do it again, I promise. (doorbell ringing) - [Guy] Hi. - [Mary Ann] Hi. - Okay, I haven't been very serious about cleaning up my act. I paid a lot of lip service to it but that's about it. I don't know why. Maybe I just haven't found a good enough reason? Can I tell you something? And this is the truth. You have been on my mind since the very first time I saw you. I remember you were sitting there in your white uniform, sunlight on your hair. You were so pretty. So pure. - Guy, don't make me out to be some kind of saint. - Yeah, well, I'll match records with you any time. See, what I'm saying is that if it meant that I could be with you, I think I could do it. I think I could. Give me a chance. Clean slate. - Okay. Clean slate. - There's one other thing. I can't go home. See everything in that apartment is about drugs. That's what she's about If the phone rings that's what it's about. It's been my whole life for years and I just don't trust myself if I go back there. I'd go to a motel but the cab driver took my last dime. - Okay. You can sleep on the couch. - I never imagined it any other way. (children chattering) You're a great cook. - Guy, it's a baloney sandwich. - Yeah, but it's the best baloney sandwich I've ever eaten. Jenny look! Want a balloon? - Can I? - Yeah. - Mommy, how long is he gonna stay with us? - [Mary Ann] I don't know, we'll have to see. - I like him. - I know, so do I. - Okay, I owe you one, man. - Yeah, okay. - See ya. - Later. - He's got them all! Ha, ha, ha! Here you go, princess. - [Jenny] All right! - Guy, I thought you were broke. - Yeah, well, I know the guy. - How? - He sells more than balloons. - Did you buy more than balloons? - Course not. I made you promise, didn't I? - You keep the promises you make? - I'll keep any promise I ever make to you. (soft music) Hey sunshine. Would you care to join me on the sofa? It's pretty comfy. - That's not exactly what I had in mind. - So? What'd you have in mind? (soft music) - Do you, Mary Ann, take Guy to be your lawful wedded husband, to love and to cherish him from this time forward, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health as long as you both shall live? - Oh, I do. - [Justice Of The Peace] By the power vested in me by the state of Nevada, I declare you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. (crowd clapping) (crowd gasping) - Come on, everybody, grab a glass. - I don't know how much longer this smile is gonna last. - He seems okay. A little hyper, but he's probably just nervous about getting married. - So it doesn't bother you that your sister-in-law is marrying an unemployed heroin addict? - Former heroin addict. - Yeah right. - I want to propose a toast, everybody. To my bride and to my beautiful daughter, may we have many, many happy years before Mary Ann realizes what a big mistake she's made. - Oh no! (crowd clapping) (phones ringing) - Here are the charts for this morning. - Already? I don't know where you worked before but they were crazy to let you leave. - Private methadone clinic. I was ready for a change. - To a psych ward? - Bastard to the Bahamas was taken. - Listen, Mr Hobbs needs his Demerol. Could you take care of that? - Oh, I'm on my way. Morning, Mr Hobbs. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - [Women On P.A.] Dr Michalson to cardiology. Dr Michalson to cardiology. - Ah! - Hi! - Oh Guy, you scared me. - [Guy] I'm a scary guy. - Are these for me? - No, they're for Princess Diana but I wanted you to have a look at 'em first. - Why did you do this? - Because I love you. - I love you too. What did you have too hawk to buy these? - Nothing, I just lifted 'em from the gift shop. - Oh Guy, you're kidding. - I am kidding. I got a job. - Oh, oh, that's great! - Don't get so excited. It's in a movie theater, I'm assistant manager trainee which means I think I'm in charge of scraping the bubble gum off the bottom of the seats. - Oh. Oh honey, I'm so proud of you. It must be so hard after running your own business. - Yeah, well, recovering heroin addict does cast a certain pall on the resume, but wait til you get a load of me in my little red vest. - Oh, I can't wait. - So how you like working here? - Beats unemployment. - Not by much. Mr Conklin said you used to own some big clothing store. - Yep. - So what happened? - [Guy] Went out of business. - Yeah, how come? - Byron, my failure in life is not exactly my favorite topic of conversation. - I'm sorry, I was just curious. Just surprised you couldn't get a better job than this. (phones ringing) - Mary Ann, have you seen the key to the pharmacy? - No, is it missing? - I can't find it. This is really gonna raise some hell. - Maybe someone left in the door. I'll go look. - [Woman On P.A.] Dr Franklin, 5321. Dr Franklin, 5321. (suspenseful music) Key was in the door I'm just checking to make sure that nothing's missing, but it seems fine. - I can't believe anybody could be so careless. You take your time. Check everything - I will. (suspenseful music) (rock music blaring) - [Woman] Hi. - Well. Now, I've seen it all - Dino, what are you doing here? - I was in the neighborhood. I had an urge for some stale, overpriced popcorn. Look at you, very sharp. All you need now is a monkey and a tin cup. - Yeah, yeah, come on, let me have it. - You know, I heard you were working here, but I didn't believe it. - It's not so bad. A lot of stuff caught up with me. It was time to clean up my act. - Yeah, well, whatever it takes, huh? - That's right. - So, uh, is there anything I can do for you? - No. I'm clean I've been clean for six months. - So you're a citizen. I mean is one hit gonna kill ya? - Guy. I don't pay you to gab with your friends. - Ha, ha! What are we in high school? - Ignore him. - Come on, show me how clean the can is. - Hey Deano, I just told you. It's worth it to me, man. I'm getting a little honesty in my life. - Guy, you got a hearing problem? - Hey, if you talk to him like that for minimum wage, this honesty, you can have it. Hey, if you change your mind you know where to find me. (suspenseful music) - Yes, just a second Mary Ann, your landlady. - Thanks. Hello. Really? Well, I'm sure it's been a mix up the bank. If you'll put it through again. Oh, well I'll look into it. I'm sure it's just a mix-up. Okay. - Hi. Sorry I'm late. Some old lady, she slipped and fell. I had to write a whole novel for the insurance company. What's wrong? - Where's the money, Guy? - What money? - My money. The rent check bounced. The lady at the bank said that the money in the savings account was gone. She closed the account a week ago. - Mary Ann. - It was almost $10,000, Guy. Do you know how long it took me to save that much? It was for our future, for Jenny's future. And don't you think for a minute that I don't know what happened to that. You come home at night and you get in bed with me and it's like everything's fine. What did you think? Did you think I wouldn't notice? - I was gonna put it back. - How? You don't make enough money to put gas in the car. How you gonna put back my life savings? - I ran into this guy. It was just gonna be one time and before I knew it, I was back in it all over again. Look, my brother, Steve, owes me some money. Maybe I'll just go stay with him for a few weeks, huh? I'll tell him what happened and we'll see what he can do. - Fine. - So then I'll come back and I'll check myself into a detox and I'll get clean. - Oh, I know. Clean slate. (suspenseful music) - [Boy] Mom, mom, can we open the presents now? - Can we just get started? - Mary Ann, you know your father, he won't let me have anything to do with the presents. - He's taking forever. (man whistling) - [Man] All right, where is everybody? (children laughing) (soft music) Let's see. Daryl. - [Daryl] All right a big one. - [Man] And this one's for Sandra. - Thanks. What about Mary Ann? - Well, didn't you get one? Hmm. I guess I forgot to get you anything. - What? Well, you two can go shopping for something tomorrow. How's that? (soft music) - You can play with mine. (dramatic music) (doorbell ringing) (doorbell ringing) - [Mary Ann] Who is it? - [Man] Police, open up. - [Mary Ann] Oh. - I'm Detective Bayer, this is my partner. - [Mary Ann] What is it? - We're looking for Guy Grant. May we look around? - He, I... He's not here. I don't know where he is. What's this-- - [Detective Bayer] Are you Mrs Grant? - [Mary Ann] Yes. - You don't know where your husband is? - Well, we had a fight and he left. Can you tell me what this is about? - Someone cleaned out the safe at the movie theater over the weekend. Your husband is the only one with a combination. - No. - We have a warrant for his arrest. - Mommy, a man came into my room. Mommy, what's going on? - Please. - I don't get it. You're the best employee I've had in years. I thought you wanted to go somewhere. I know you're too smart to be mixed up in something like this. You've got a lovely family. I mean is it worth wrecking your life to feel good for a few minutes? - Mr Conklin, uh, Guy already feels really bad about what he did. His brother lent us some money. You said you would drop the charges if we paid you back. - All right. You know, I don't know if I'm doing you a favor letting you think that you can pull something like this with no consequences. Nadine, give me that Sergeant Oakland on the phone. - [Mary Ann] Finished with your sandwich? - Mm-hm. - [Mary Ann] Drink your milk. - [Guy] I'm going out. - No, you're not. - Where are the car keys? - You're not going anywhere, Guy. - What you hide them? Great, that's just great. Am I being grounded, mom? Just going round to the store. - I know where you want to go. - Mary Ann, would you just give me the keys? (door slamming shut) - Jennifer, go over to Mrs Lindy's and ask if you can stay there for a while, okay? - What's wrong with Daddy? - He's having a bad day. Look, take your crayons. I'll come get you in a couple of hours, all right. - Mm-hm. (dramatic music) - What is that? - What? - [Guy] What is this on the floor? - There's nothing on the floor. - [Guy] What are these pills? Where'd they go? - There's nothing there, Guy. - What did you do with these pills? - There are no pills, you're hallucinating. - You think that this is funny? You put them there and then you take them away. You think that this is cute or something. Huh? - I think you should go back to bed. - No, I'm not going to stay here with you and your games. Mary Ann, now, you're gonna give me the damn keys! - No. - Fine. I'll walk. (dramatic music) Where's my money? I had some money. - You gave it to Mr Conklin, Guy. He was there. (glass shattering) Oh! - Where's your money? - I don't have any. - Give me every... - I don't have any. I don't! Guy! I don't have any. I don't have any! - Liar! - No! Stop! Stop it! Okay. At the hospital, my cheque. - All right. Let's go to the hospital. (dramatic music) - Jane! - Mary Ann, what's wrong? - I need your help. My husband is in the car. He's a heroin addict. - What? - And he's in withdrawal and he's psychotic. (dramatic music) Guy. - Got it? - You have to come in with me. They won't give me the cheque unless you go sign for it. - For God's sake! Okay, where? - Mr Grant, I'm Dr Gordon. Can we talk for a minute? - Why? What's this about? - [Dr Grant] We want you to stay here. We want to help you. - Get your hands off me. - Okay, we're just gonna take a walk. - Like hell! - [Man] Grab him! (dramatic music) - [Man] Grab him! - You bitch! You tricked me, Mary Ann. I'll kill ya! I'll kill you, Mary Ann. I'll kill ya. (dramatic music) (machine beeping) (dramatic music) - Mary Ann, Guy's conscious. He's asking for you. (somber music) - [Mary Ann] Guy? - How long I've been here? - [Mary Ann] Two weeks. (somber music) - Doc, thanks a lot. - Sure. - Appreciate it. - You take care. - You bet I will. - Mary Ann, you're a nice lady. You're a terrific nurse. You don't need this. - What do you mean? He's fine now. - Don't sell yourself some fantasy. Once a junkie always a junkie. (horn honking) - Come on! Can't wait til somebody asks me what I've been doing. Haven't you heard? I'm the world's oldest living movie usher. I might make night manager. It's between me and the captain of the swim team. - Tell 'em you sell life insurance. That'll shut 'em up. - Ha, ha, ha, ha. That's not bad. - Hey, look at this. I'm glad you came, man. This must be your beautiful wife. - Mary Ann, this is Nick. - Hi. - Hey, come on in. (soft piano music) Probably know some people here. - [Guy] Okay. - Listen, um, down that hall, last door on the left, help yourself, okay. - No, no, I don't consume. - Come on, Guy, don't give me that I'm clean this week garbage, huh. - I am. Well. - What? - What? You need permission? Honey, it's a party. Now, one head is not gonna turn him back into a junkie. Okay? - Why's everyone looking at me? - [Guy] I've been clean for a long time. - I know. - [Guy] So it's not like I can't do it. - I know. - I'm gonna have one here but that's all. I promise. - [Nick] Yeah, well, everybody believes you, Guy. Go on down. - I'm gonna be the only one here who isn't high. - Yeah, well, nobody hangs out with Nick for his wit and charm. - What's it feel like? - Oh. It's really no way to describe it. Really. There's just no way to describe it. - I wanna try it. - What? - Yeah, I wanna see what it feels like. Just once. - But, Mary Ann, you? - Yeah me. Guy, it's been a big part your life I've always been left out of. - Yeah, well, it's not a part of my life anymore. - Why are we standing here? Just once, if it's not gonna hurt you, it won't hurt me either. - Okay, if you're sure. - I'm sure. - Hold it. (suspenseful music) Hmm. Nothing like virgin veins. - Hmm. How long will it take? - As long as it takes me to answer you. - I don't feel anything. - You don't? My turn. - [Mary Ann] Hello, Mrs Fuller. Hi. Hi, this is Mary Ann. Um, I wanted to know, Guy and I are gonna be out a lot later tonight than we thought. - [Guy] All night. - All night and I was wondering if maybe, um, Jennifer could spend the night with you? Thank you. Thank you, I really appreciate it. I... I really appreciate it. I'm sorry. I'll pick her up first thing in the morning. - [Guy] Yeah. - Okay, thank you. - Thank you, good night. - You make it so hard. - Well, what do you think she was gonna say? Hey, they're laughing, they're out having a good time, they must be stoned. I better call the social workers. - Well, she might. - Mary Ann, we don't look like junkies. We look like Ken and Barbie. (dramatic music) - [Jane] Do you? - Oh God, I'm sorry. - Are you okay? - Yeah, slow blood sugar. I'll get a cookie. - [Woman On P.A. System] Dr Murphy, neurology. Dr Murphy, neurology. - Thanks again. - Okay, man. See you tomorrow. - [Guy] Hey! - Guy, we gotta talk. - Sure, what do want to talk about what? - I'm pregnant. - What? - I'm pregnant. I took a home test and I'm probably a couple of months along. I thought it was just all this dope in my body. - Mary Ann, I don't believe this. This is great! - Great? - You know how long I've wanted to have a son? Since I was 16 years old. Oh Mary Ann, I don't believe this. - How do you know it's gonna be a boy? - Because I know it is. Oh, this is wonderful. - What if something's wrong with it? - Nothing's gonna be wrong with it. - But we took all that stuff. - No, listen to me. Everything's gonna be just fine. We're both gonna get clean and you're gonna eat all the right stuff, healthy stuff and everything is gonna be fine. I promise you. Ho, ho! A son, huh? Let me get those. - [Mary Ann] They're not heavy. - I'll get them. You buy anything green? - Yeah, mouthwash. - Asparagus. I'll make you an omelet. - With asparagus? - Iron and protein. I'm gonna have you in great shape in no time. Made a doctor's appointment for you day after tomorrow. - Guy! - It's time. You've been clean for weeks. - But I'll have to take off my clothes. I still got track marks. - We'll figure something out. Mary Ann, you're going to the doctor. - Well, everything looks fine. Heartbeat's fine, your blood count is fine. - Good. - Of course, you should have started prenatal care as soon as you found you were pregnant. You're a nurse, Mary Ann, you know that. - Well, I haven't had any problems. - You haven't had any that you know about. What happened here? - I burned it cooking with oil. - Have you been getting enough rest? - Well, with a husband and a job and a small child. - I know. Well, just do the best you can and make sure you get enough to eat. I want to see some weight on you your next visit. - Okay. - Mary Ann, did you have any questions? - No. - You just don't seem like yourself. - Well, you've never seen me pregnant before. I'm fine. - Okay, call me if you need anything. - Okay. Oh. Damn. - There you go, you got it! I can't believe that! My mother could have caught that pass. Honey, you look tired. Did you have your protein drink? - Yes. - Mary Ann. What's the matter? - I can't stand it. - Can't stand what? - The way I feel. I want to die. - Oh, honey, it's gonna be alright. - It's not gonna be alright. Guy, I need something. Just, just a little something, but I need a break, okay. Just for a little while. - Mary Ann, what about the baby? - The doctor said the baby's fine. I just need one hit. How much could it hurt, please. Just a little bit please, Guy. Please. I just need-- - All right, all right. All right, we'll get some. Shh. I'll get you something. - Uh. Well, did you get it? How much? Good, okay, where are you now? Well, come straight home, okay. Don't stop anywhere. Okay, bye. - [Jenny] Mommy, look. - Hmm. - Look. (dramatic music) - What's on your arm? - [Jenny] I drew it. - Why? - I wanted to be like you and Daddy. (dramatic music) - You go in the bathroom and you wash this off. And don't you ever do this again! Just go! (Jenny sobbing) - Oh, oh, will you look at that! Honey, you did it. Mary Ann, you did it. Look at it. That's my son. Look at that. That's my son. I called it, didn't I call it? - [Doctor] Mr Grant, please. - Guy, Guy, is he all right? - Oh, he is gorgeous. Looks just like me. - What is it, is he gorgeous or he looks just like you? - Hey, cute. He's perfect. I counted everything, it's all there. - Oh. Thank God. - Thank you. I'll be back. - Oh my boy. - [Guy] Oh, look at him! (baby crying) - He doesn't seem hungry. Some babies just don't like bottles. Oh, there, there, sweetie. It's okay. He's been crying for an awful long time. Why don't you take him for a minute? I'm just gonna go get the doctor to come look at him, just see that everything is all right. (baby crying) - We don't have much time. Do you have the stuff? - It's in my pocket. I don't wanna do this. - Well, do you think I do? Look, we just do it once, okay. As soon as my milk comes in, I will lower my dosage and we will wean him gradually. He will be fine. - He's so tiny. - But if he goes into withdrawal, then they'll call the social workers. - Maybe they won't know that anything is wrong? - They'll know. And they'll take him away and we'll never see him again. Just do as I told you. We will never have to do this again. - Okay. (dramatic music) Hey Jenny, you wanna take a ride on the rocket? - Yeah! - Excuse me, sir. I'm interested in looking at some portable TVs, do you think you could explain some of the difference in prices to me? - [Worker] Oh, certainly. (piano music) (baby crying) - I'm sorry. (dramatic music) - Excuse me. How old is your baby? - Six months. - Hi there. I got an 18 month-old grandchild at home. Seems like she was this little a week ago. Have a nice day. (Guy and Mary Ann laughing) - What's so funny? - Hey kiddo. I got another quarter, you want to ride the rocket again? - Yeah. - Maybe you can help me? My brother gave me this for our anniversary, but I already have one and I didn't want to embarrass him by asking for a receipt. (baby crying) - Mommy, wake up. - [Mary Ann] Mmm. - Mommy, the baby's wet. Daddy, wake up. Daddy. Mommy. (baby crying) Hi, Sonny. Don't worry, I'm going to be changing your diaper, okay. Don't worry. Mom's too tired. Mom's sleeping. So is daddy. Come on. - [Woman On P.A. System] Dr Jergenson, 3562. - Denise, my husband is supposed to come by. If you see him, could you tell him I'm in the utility room? - No problem. (knocking on door) - What took you so long? - It's not my fault. The guy I was meeting was late. I'm not exactly dealing with model citizens here. - Give me as much as you give yourself. - No. - Why is it I never get as much? - Mary Ann, you weigh 50 pounds less than I do. - I'm a nurse. I know how much I can take. It's more than half my money, I want my fair share. - Fine. I'll give you some more. (thudding) Ladies. (dramatic music) - Hey Denise, did I leave a chart out... (dramatic music) - Mary Ann, what's wrong? (dramatic music) - Mary Ann! Are you okay? - [Mary Ann] No, don't, don't! - Hold still. I need a cart. Hold still. I just wanna get your... Hold still. - [Denise] Hold still - Just rip it, Denise, rip it. Where's that cart? Oh my God. Get a crash cart over here now! Page the doctor fast! - No, Sandra, I'm fine. I didn't quit, I took a leave. Oh no. I'm tired. I was working forever. I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm standing here looking at these photos that you sent of you and the baby. - [Mary Ann] So? - Well, you look horrible. You're thin as a rail. You've got circles under your eyes. You look like a refuge from a concentration camp so don't you tell me there's nothing wrong. I'm your sister. I love you. If something's wrong, I wanna know about it. - No, no light. - That was Sandra. She wanted to know why I look so bad in those pictures I sent. - [Guy] Did you look bad? - She thinks so. I thought I'd look great. - What'd you tell her? - [Mary Ann] Told her the truth. - What? - Told her I'm an anorexic. (Guy laughing) Told her I had to leave work, I got so sick. She wants us to come up to Oregon till I get better. - What'd you say? - I said sure. I mean what the hell. We can get clean on the way to Oregon. - Hmm, not like we got anything better to do. - No. No. ♪ Pine tree, pine tree, pine tree, pine tree, pine tree ♪ Pine tree, pine tree, pine tree, pine tree, pine tree ♪ Pine tree, pine tree ♪ Oak tree, oak tree, oak tree, oak tree, oak tree ♪ Oak tree, oak tree, oak tree - Jennifer, would you stop the damn singing? (baby crying) What Sonny? What for crying out loud? - Will ya give him something to quiet him down? - What, I gave him everything! - Give him something. - I don't have anything. - Give him a bottle, will ya. - I think he has a bottle. (baby screaming) Here we are. Hold on. Get it Jenny. Hold on. You're a great (mumbles) Watch your head, watch your head. Come on. Never getting in that car again. Hope they're still awake. (doorbell ringing) - Hey you guys, where have you been? You were supposed to be here five days ago. - [Sandra] We've been worried sick. - We made bad time. - Well, you didn't call either. - Well, we didn't have money to call. Sandra, find me a place for Sonny to sleep. - [Sandra] Sure, sure. Come on Jenny, let me show you your rooms. - Hey Jack. - [Sandra] Hey Sonny, are you a sleepyhead, huh? - What's wrong with you two? You look terrible - Well, we've been driving for days. We had to sleep in the car. I was sick, how do you expect us to look? Jack, where's the bathroom? - Down the hall to the left. Mary Ann. - I don't want to talk. - Well, maybe I should call the doctor. - Don't call the... I'm fine! Don't call the doctor. - Mary Ann, what's wrong? - Mary Ann, we'll pay for it. - Would you please tell me what is going on. - She won't tell me what's wrong. I'm gonna call the doctor. - Don't, don't! You can't call the doctor. - Mary Ann. - I am a heroin addict. I'm in withdrawal. So is Guy. I don't think I can take this much longer. If I don't get something soon I think I want to kill myself. - It's okay. We'll get you some help. I'm really sorry, Mary Ann. I don't want to do this but I don't know where else to take you. The emergency room told us to go to a treatment center, but none of them would take her without the insurance. - [Receptionist] Sign here. (dramatic music) - Just give me a little something to make me feel better. Just a little something. (door slamming shut) No! Come back, don't close me in! Come back! Don't leave me here! Oh, please don't do that! Don't do that! Please I need it! Oh, you don't know! Please. Oh God! No! Come back! God! (somber music) - Get up! Get up! - What? What? - Here. It's a flight schedule. Pick a city and I'll book you a flight one way. I want you out of my house and I want you out now. - What about Mary Ann? What about my kids? - Forget it, pal, you're never gonna see them again as long as there's a breath in my body. You are a liar, a thief, a dope fiend. You got Mary Ann hooked on drugs and I'm shipping you the hell out of here instead of killing you. So just pick up the phone and book yourself a flight before I change my mind. Do it! - Are you ready to get out of here? - Oh yeah. How are the kids? - Oh fine. - Can't wait to see 'em. - I'm sure they'll be glad to see you too. - Why didn't Guy come with you? Sandra? - Mary Ann, Guy's gone. - What do you mean he's gone? - Well, he left right after I checked you into the hospital. - Well, where'd he go? - I don't know, he didn't say. - Well, when's he coming back? I can't believe that, he wouldn't just leave. - Mary Ann, Guy is a junkie, he doesn't care about you or the kids or anything except his dope. He got you hooked on heroin. Is that something you do to somebody you're supposed to love? You're a good person, Mary Ann. This didn't happen because you did something bad. It happened because you fell in love with that slick-talking bastard. He dragged you down with him so he'd have some company in his slime. - I can't believe he'd just leave us. - [Jack] Morning. - Morning. - [Sandra] So how was the meeting? - What? - Last night, how was it? - Uh, that, I didn't make it - Oh, well, there's probably another one tonight. I'll just check the schedule that they gave us. - Sandra. I don't want to go to those meetings. I don't want to sit there and tell my life story to a bunch of strangers. It's just the last thing I need right now. - Well, you said you'd go. They wouldn't have let you out. - Yeah, well, they did let me out. - Mary Ann. - I didn't say I was never gonna go. I just don't want to go right now . Yeah, maybe when I have my new place. - Mary Ann, if you can't even handle going to a meeting, I'm not so sure that you're ready to have your own place. - I am ready. I'm fine. Would you at least let me do something wrong before you start convicting me! - [Man] So where would you like these, ma'am? - [Mary Ann] Uh, both of these go in the back bedroom, please. - [Man] Okay. - [Jenny] Mommy, is daddy gonna come here and live with us? - No, I don't think so. - Why not? - Well, he has to be somewhere else right now. Let's go to your room and put your bed. (somber music) (soft music) (somber music) (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Mary Ann] Mrs Grant? Hi, this is Mary Ann. - Mary Ann? - [Mary Ann] I'm looking for Guy. I was wondering if you knew where I could reach him. - Just a minute. Guy, it's Mary Ann, she wants to talk with you. - Mary Ann? - Guy. - [Guy] It's really you. - Last time I looked. - [Guy] I was starting to think I'd never hear from ya again. - Well, phones work both ways, you know. - I figured you'd just hang up on me. - [Mary Ann] You could have tried. - I know. It's just you know. You never answered any of my letters. - What letters? - You mean you haven't gotten them? I've written a letter every single day since Jack put me on that plane. Sometimes I wrote two or three. You haven't gotten any of them? - Jack put you on the plane? - He gave me my complimentary one-way ticket. - I don't believe this. Sandra told me that you just left and nobody knew where you were. I could kill her! - No, they were just trying to protect you. I've got so much to tell you. I've been clean for five months. I'm going to a lot of meetings. I've been doing all right. I'm gonna be okay. But I miss you so much and I miss the kids. But please tell them I didn't just leave. God, I can't even believe I'm talking to you. - I miss you so much. - I miss you too. Listen, why don't you come here? I'll send the plane tickets and we can live with my mom until we get back on our feet. - [Mary Ann] When? - There's just one thing. - [Mary Ann] What? - I can't risk it unless you're clean. - I am! I've been clean for five months! - God, I don't believe it. I love you. - I love you so much. Oh. - [Woman On P.A. System] Flight 183, your service has been delayed, we're now ready for boarding at gate 24. - Daddy. - Jenny! - Daddy! - Hey! Oh Jenny. Hi. - [Mary Ann] Hi. - Oh God, I missed you. Hey. Got a good job in a travel agency. I'm actually saving money. It's amazing how much money you can save when you're not shooting it into your arm. We ought to be able to rent a house pretty soon. I think it's not gonna be long before we begin to get on my mother's nerves. - Well, I intend to look for a job first thing tomorrow. - No way. Sweetheart, I want you to rest and get adjusted. I don't want any pressure on you until you're feeling rock solid. - Guy, I'm broke. If I don't get a job I don't have a cent. - We don't need money. Meetings are free, resting is free, I'm free. - Are you worried about what I'm gonna spend the money on? - No. Look, you just got here, let's worry about this later, huh? I'm just glad to have you home. (dramatic music) - Excuse me! Excuse me, sir. Would you have any spare change? - Check. - Thank you. - Hello. - Daddy! - Hey! Where's mom? - I don't know. - She's been gone since right after lunch. - Say where she was going? - She didn't even say goodbye. (dramatic music) - Uh, oh. (glass shattering) - [Guy] What happened? Did something happen that I don't know about? - No. - [Guy] What made you start drinking again? - [Jenny] Mommy, can I go with Suzy to the store? - Yeah, sure. - [Jenny] She said yes. - So? - I didn't start drinking again. I never stopped. - Mary Ann, you told me you were sober. - I said I was clean. - Oh, give me a break. - Well, I'll get sober. - When Mary Ann? - Mommy, I can't find Sonny's diaper bag. - I'll be there in a minute. Guy, it's not that easy for me. - You think it was easy for me? That's cancer. This is the address of a meeting. It starts at 10:30. Get dressed now, you can make it, okay. Mary Ann. - All right. - You're not gonna fool anyone anymore. Those days are over. (door slamming shut) (doorbell ringing) - Is this the Grant residence? - Yeah. - Um, I found this lady passed out in the park and her ID had this address on it. You guys missing somebody? - What are you doing? - Packing your things. You're moving out. - What? - I found you an apartment. I'll pay the rent until you can get a job. When you get yourself into a program and show me you can stay sober, you can move back in. Until then I don't want you anywhere near me and the kids. - What gives you the right? - I'll tell you what! Six months of staying clean and sober. The hell I went through putting my life back together, that's what gives me the right. - I'm not gonna leave my kids. - Our kids have been through enough. They're not gonna sit here every night and watch you brought home by whatever stranger happens to find you wherever you happen to pass out. Mary Ann, how do you think it feels seeing you that way? - You can't do this to me. - You're doing it to yourself. - What did I do? Please. - Mary Ann. I'm Al Van Petten. It's nice to meet you. I just finished reading your life story. - Then you must know how many times I've flunked therapy. - Yeah. - I don't see why this time should be any different. - I know how you feel. - No, you don't. You guys just say that cuz some book said you're supposed to, but you haven't lived my life. - I was a heroin addict for 11 years. My life was in smoking ruins by the time I got into serious recovery. I was broke, unemployed and unemployable. Took me a few false starts too. - Yeah, well. That's you. - And what, you're more screwed up than I was? This is my son Michael. He was born addicted to heroin. His mother and I were shooting up about five times a day. He spent his first couple of days in agony going through withdrawal. We almost lost him. You didn't invent anything new, Mary Ann. - [Guy] So you like this guy? That's good. - [Mary Ann] Yeah, it should help, I guess. - [Guy] Been going to meetings? - [Mary Ann] Mm-hmm. I found one in a church in Santa Monica. - [Guy] I thought you were gonna go to the one I told you about. - [Mary Ann] It's too hard-nosed, I couldn't deal with it. - [Guy] It's supposed to be hard-nosed. See that's why it works. - That's why it works for you. - Hmm. You know, I thought you were serious this time. - Don't start on me, Guy. I have a right to find my own way. - Yeah, certainly worked last time. - Don't do this. God, do you see what you do? Yeah, I can't even recover to suit you. (water splashing) - I'm sorry. I mean it. You're right. I just want you to hurry up and get well. I want you back with us. And I feel very guilty. - For what? - For getting you hooked. - You didn't. - Of course I did. - You didn't get me hooked. I was hooked for years. I just didn't think I was an addict cuz I didn't shoot anything into my veins. That's the only thing you introduced me to. - What are you saying? - Before I knew you, I was on Valium, Demerol, Dilaudid, Morphine, Methadone. - No way. I would have known. - How? You were too out of it to notice anything. - All these years you never told me. - I didn't want you to know. I was embarrassed. - Embarrassed? You know what you're telling me? I mean all this time I thought that Jack was right. I thought that I ruined your life. I mean I was ready to give up my kids because I thought that's what I deserved and you just let me think it. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? (door slamming shut) It's like every time I turn over a rock, there's another pack of lies. I mean who knows what else she hasn't told me. - [Mary Ann] There's nothing else. I was being honest, I thought it was supposed to be cleaning all this up. - [Al] You are. - Well, how with that kind of support that I'm getting? - How can you say that? I have given her nothing but support. I pay the rent, I take care of the kids. - You tell me what meeting to go to. You breathe down my neck. - Yeah, like you haven't given me any reason to and then you sit there! How can you be so self-righteous? - I'm self-righteous! - Okay, okay, just calm down. Guy, you know what Mary Ann's going through. You've been there. - So it's my fault? - It's no one's fault, we're not talking about fault. Mary Ann needs a safety of knowing that you're still committed to this relationship. Can you let her know that? - No. - So what are we gonna do? - I don't know. - Do you want to-- - I don't know, Mary Ann. I can't think right now. (tires screeching) (somber music) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) (dramatic music) (siren blaring) Excuse me, what happened? - You live here? - My wife does, apartment B. Is that her? - She tried to kill herself. Neighbors smelled gas and called 911. Close call. She'll be okay. (dramatic music) (somber music) - Okay, why don't you tell me again what you promised me? - [Mary Ann] I won't do anything. - The whole thing. - I won't do anything to hurt myself accidentally or on purpose. - What else? - I'll call you if I want to talk. - And if you can't find me? - I'll call someone else. - [Al] Do you have a sponsor? - Not yet, I'll get one. - Today. - Yeah. - Have you heard from Guy? - I really think I've lost him this time. - Maybe you have. Maybe you've lost Guy. Maybe you've lost your kids, maybe you've lost everything. You're better off looking that in the face than having it sneak up on you in the dark. There's one good thing about having everything stripped away. It forces you to look at what's left. - There's nothing left. - You're left. (dramatic music) - Guy. (dramatic music) (glass shattering) (dramatic music) Okay God, help me now. I don't know how to live and you won't let me die so help me. (somber music) Hello, is this Dorothy? This is Mary Ann, I met you at the Thursday morning meeting and you said you'd be my sponsor if I wanted one. Would you meet me someplace? Uh-huh. After I became a nurse, I did everything I could get my hands on. No one knew because I was a master at hiding it. I was so busy being super nurse that no one could get close enough to me to see my bloodshot eyes and notice that my speech was slurred. I didn't believe I was addicted. I mean I know what a junkie looks like and that wasn't me. But it was me. Even after I figured that out I couldn't ask for help because I didn't want anyone to know. All my life I'd felt I was horrible, that I wasn't worth anything. And drugs were the only way I could get rid of that feeling. I didn't care if they killed me, as long as the drugs got rid of that feeling. After I stopped running from my feelings, I found that dealing with them wasn't nearly so hard as trying to run from them all the time. I thank God for making me figure that out before it was too late. And I thank my husband, Guy, for having the guts to stop trying to save me so I could save myself. Thank you for letting me share my story. (audience clapping)
