Klytus, I'm bored. What plaything can you offer me today? An obscure body in the SK system, Your Majesty. The inhabitants refer to it as the planet "Earth". How peaceful it looks. Most effective, Your Majesty. Will you destroy this "Earth"? Later. I like to play with things a while... before annihilation. ♪ Flash, ah-ah, saviour of the universe ♪ Flash, ah-ah, he'll save every one of us ♪ Flash, ah-ah, he's a miracle ♪ Flash, ah-ah, king of the impossible ♪ He's for every one of us Stand for every one of us ♪ He'll save with a mighty hand every man, every woman, every child ♪ With a mighty flash ♪ Flash, ah-ah ♪ Flash, ah-ah, he'll save every one of us ♪ Just a man with a man's courage ♪ You know he's nothing but a man ♪ But he can never fail ♪ No one but the pure in heart will find the golden grail, oh oh-oh ♪ Oh oh-oh ♪ Flash! ♪ Green Mountain Airways 123 request joining instructions. Well, I sure hope Flash Gordon had a great vacation. Gonna have to work hard to top last season. - Any problem, fellas? - Bit of clear air turbulence. Nothing serious. Nothing you'd want to toss a third-down pass through either. Would you like to autograph this for my kid, Mr. Gordon? - Glad to. What's his name? - Buzz. - Call Boston approach, see what they got. - It might be smoother higher up. Would you do us a favour and leave 'em alone? They're busy driving the bus. It's just a little turbulence. We'll be through it in a minute. - My name's Flash. - I know. Look, I'm sorry if I seemed rude. I'm just a little scared. Ooh, it's kind of nice. I mean, a travel agent who's scared in airplanes. I saw you at the hotel last night, I asked the maître d' who you were. Ooh! Talk to me, please. Get my mind off this. I couldn't believe a girl like you was alone. - You're just saying that to get my mind off this. - No, I mean it. What were you doing there alone? I was... trying to get my head together. By myself, you know? I sure do. - Oh! - It's OK, it's all right. Honestly, it's nothing. - Famous last words. - I'm taking flying lessons. Sometimes air rises above clouds and you get a... What's the matter? What's happening, Flash? Dr. Zarkov! There's no sun. It's 8:24 in the morning, and there's no sun! - No sun? - No. Check the angular vector of the moon. Seemingly there is no reason for these extraordinary intergalactical upsets. Only Dr. Hans Zarkov, formerly at NASA, has provided any explanation. His ideas, however, have been rejected by the scientific community as irrational. According to scientists at NASA, this morning's unprecedented solar eclipse is no cause for alarm. A team of NASA scientists has been in conference with the president since 7:00 this morning. What do you find? The moon out of orbit? By more than 12 degrees. This must be a mistake. No. That's no mistake. It's an attack. I've been right all these years. Fragments of moon rock. Our moon is being subjected to some enormous force from outer space. A kind of energy beam. - Time for us to go, Munson. - Go where? I've got the coordinates now, the direction it's coming from. This is what we've been waiting for, Munson. We'll go up and counter-attack them. You're crazy. I'm not going up in that! - I can't handle the capsule alone. - You'd better try. - Get your toothbrush and whatever. - Right, chief. Munson! Munson! Munson! Why are you running away? I don't understand it. All the frequencies are dead. - Get a look at the V.O.R. - Holy cow! John, ten o'clock! Hold on tight. I'll put this baby down right here. What the hell? My God! Where are the pilots? Hydraulic's going! Grab that wheel. Help me pull her up. Are we coming up? I can't see a thing! Me neither! Look for the landing lights. This isn't my scene, Flash. Look where? Switches over there. Start hitting them! Listen, did your flying lessons get as far as landing? I was afraid you'd ask that. No. Hang on, here we go! Munson? I swear, Munson, I'll shoot! Get shot or go up in that thing, what's the difference? This way you'll be giving your life to save the Earth. - Haven't you any spirit at all? - No! - Dr. Zarkov, listen! - You're back! - Dale, you all right? - Oh, I'm terrific. Come on, let's get out of here before she blows. Just hold me two seconds, then drop me and I'll kiss the ground. - Are you sure you're OK? - I'm fine. But that's it, no more flying for me. - Good morning! Are you injured? - Lord knows why but it seems not. A miracle. I expect you'd like to use my phone? - Thanks. I would. - Well it's right in there. Listen, we wrecked your place. I'm sure the insurance... Oh, please, don't mention it. - What the hell happened to the sun? - Looks like an eclipse. Are you sure? There was nothing about an eclipse on TV. Well, the phone is right in there. Sorry, Munson. Missed your opportunity. - Where's the telephone? - Flash, I'm sure that's Dr. Hans Zarkov. - Who? - He's a crazy scientist. I saw him on TV, he kept talking about an attack on the Earth. They kicked him out of NASA... - Dr. Zarkov. - Enough! - Are you crazy? - Unfortunately not. The attack has begun. I estimate we have 11 days before our moon crashes down and destroys us. - I need aid in taking off. - Taking off? Well, where? Up there, where it's coming from. I need one person to keep a foot on that red pedal during blast-off. You're the lighter. Sit down. You may leave. Tell the world what Hans Zarkov has done. I guess I'll be running along now. You lunatic! You crazy... You crazy man... Flash, the door! Sit down! Keep a foot on that red pedal or the G-forces will kill us all. My God, we're moving! For God's sake, strap yourselves down! Quick! The red pedal! Friendship. Built this to send in friendship... The end now... Unless we three can... Unless we can... Strange object imaged in the imperial vortex. What distance? Now parallel to star field Zygma 12, approaching. Test object for life waves. Positive, form unknown. Approximate Mong Scale 3. Object entering our control range, approaching the Sea of Fire. Bring it through safely. Land it. Wake up. Dale, wake... We're OK! It's me, Flash. Remember? We're on the ground. - Back home? - I don't think so. Hello. We're from Earth. Friends. Flash, whoever they are, it's clear they're highly developed. - I'm sure we can reason with them. - Want to bet on it? - My God! - What is this, a civic reception? - More like a police state. - If it is, that could be our good luck. - Why? - It means we'll find allies on every side. Look at them. The poor wretches are just waiting for someone to lead them in revolt. - Are you looking at me, Zarkov? - Yes. Please, stop talking about revolts. I just want to get back home alive. Guards, halt. Prisoners, follow me. Halt, Lizard Man! Escape is impossible. Surrender. Prisoners, march below me to the presence of Emperor Ming. Let's not argue with him. Here, hold my hand. - You want to reason with that? - If it fails, I've still got the gun in my pocket. Don't worry. I'll make it plain I'm acting on my own. You'll be all right. - Zarkov, it's plain suicide. - No, it's a rational transaction. - One life for billions. - Halt! Proceed. Heil Ming, heil! Ruler of the universe! Heil Ming, heil! Emperor of the galaxy! The tributes of the Hawkmen will be first. - Are we dreaming? - I'd like to think so. The fabled Ice Jewel of Frigia. We seized it in battle from the royal crypt. Stop! The Ice Jewel is our tribute, not Vultan's. Vultan stole it while we were burying our dead on Frigia. - Liar! - You are a thief. What? Let down your weapons! No one, but no one, dies in the palace without a command from the Emperor. Hail Ming. Vultan! You obey... or you sacrifice your daughter. Hail Ming. Now the tributes from Ardentia. Your Majesty, we, the people of Ardentia, we have suffered since you blasted our kingdom. I can offer you nothing this year except my loyalty. Prince Thun, we prize nothing more highly. And tell us, how great is this loyalty to your emperor? Without measure. We are delighted to hear it. Fall on your sword. Show us this loyalty. Throw yourself onto your sword. May this deed of Prince Thun be an example to all the kingdoms of Mongo. Death to Ming! This Ming's a psycho. This Ming is a psycho. - Who said that? - The fair-haired prisoner. Come along, Fellini. Hey! Remember me? Who are you? Flash Gordon, quarterback, New York Jets. Dale Arden, Your Highness. Live and let live, that's my motto. My name is Hans Zarkov, I'm a scientist. I kidnapped them here, in an effort to save our planet Earth. An obscure body in the SK system, the satellite which has been giving you so much amusement... recently. But why? We are only interested in friendship. - Why do you attack us? - Why not? Pathetic earthlings. Hurling your bodies out into the void, without the slightest inkling of who or what is out here. If you had known anything about the true nature of the universe, anything at all, you would have hidden from it entirely. Come closer. No, not you! You. Let us see you. No. - Dale! - Don't, Flash. Did you ever see such response? No. Truly. She even rivals your daughter. - What happened to me? - I don't know, but it was pretty sensational. Remove the Earth woman. Prepare her for our pleasure. Heil Ming, heil Ming, heil! Forget it, Ming. Dale's with me. - Flash! - Stay back! Don't, Flash, they'll kill you. I'll go with them, just... Oh, you...! Flash! Yeah! Dale! Klytus! Are your men on the right pills? Maybe you should execute their trainer. Come here! You fools. He's playing some barbaric game. Now match him, like this. Now! 41! 42! - Go, Flash, go. - 43! Hut, hut! Go, Flash, go! Go, Flash, go! Don't kill him yet, Father. I want him. Give him to me. What would your Prince Barin say? I can handle Barin. Please? Really, Aura. Your appetites are too dangerous. I refuse. Guards! Deliver the scientist to General Klytus, for conditioning by the imperial secret police. This one here has defied us before our subjects. We order him disposed of tonight by public execution. This is a public announcement. The earthling Flash Gordon is to be executed at 29:15 Mingo mean time. Fly back to your kingdom. You may see me sooner than you think. Lying bitch. I'll come, if you rocket there right away. - Why? - I've a surprise for you. - Don't you love me? - I don't trust you. It's your choice. Just be there. I demand to see the governor! I can hardly breathe in this thing. Yes, you don't look well. And I'm told you refused your final meal. - The chef will be upset. - Tell him to go to hell! May be just as well. Gas works more quickly on an empty stomach. - Any final request? - Yes. Let me see Dale right away. Oh, dear. How pathetic. Yes, I anticipated that. Bring in the Emperor's concubine. - Oh, my God! - Damn you! I said I want to see her! You have until the sands run out. Pathetic. You look great. No kidding, you look great. It's the eye make-up. I hope I remember the trick when I wake up. I'll be darned. That's exactly what I was gonna tell you. - What? - This isn't happening, Dale. We're not here. It's just a bad dream. Oh, I agree completely. Why, we'll wake up any minute in Dark Harbor and laugh about this. Yeah. Only next time I won't just ask the maître d' your name, I'll walk over and talk to you. - You promise? - Promise. Cross my heart and hope to... I really will talk to you, Dale. - What if we're wrong, Flash? - We can't be. What if it isn't a dream? Then you'll find Zarkov, you'll save the Earth somehow, and he'll get you home in the capsule. - But what about you? - Don't think of me, Dale. - Think of... - Oh, Flash! No, don't. Don't look at it. It won't turn over. It won't turn over! Did you enjoy yourselves on Sybaria? I understand you flew the doctor there last week. Klytus kindly fed me the information. Klytus? He wants me himself. His agents are always making up lies about me. Look! Water is leaking from her eyes. It's what they call tears. It's a sign of their weakness. This will help you on your way. Flash! Flash! Flash! Hurry. You realise what happens to me if I'm found out? - You won't be, I swear. - I'm a fool for you, Aura. There we are. Sybaria again, same place, next weekend? I can hardly wait. - Where am I? - Back from the dead. I've saved you. - My God! How? - By magic, of course. With a kiss, because I like you. - Where's Dale and Zarkov? - Don't worry about them, they're safe now. Quickly, put this uniform on before the Lizard Men arrive to bury you. Don't worry, I won't look. I like you a lot. - Where are you taking me? - To the moon Arboria. I don't want to go to any moon. I've got to rescue my friends and save the Earth. It's pretty risky, telling that to the Emperor's daughter. - What's in Arboria? - People who'll help you. - Why? - Prince Barin does anything I ask. Oh, that's Zarkov! It's nothing, they're just conditioning him to our climate. Keep out of sight, they want us both killed. Trust me. Every thousand years I test each life system in the universe. I visit it with mysteries, earthquakes, unpredicted eclipses. Strange craters in the wilderness. If these are taken as natural, I judge that system ignorant and harmless. I spare it. But if the hand of Ming is recognised in these events, I judge that system dangerous to us. I call upon the great god Dyzan. And for his greater glory... and our mutual pleasure, I destroy it utterly. You're saying it's my fault Earth is being destroyed? Precisely, Doctor. I thought it might amuse you to know this, before your mind is gone. Proceed with it. What are you doing to me? - Oh, we're just emptying your mind. - What? We are going to empty your memory as we might empty your pockets... - ...Doctor. - No, don't do that. Please. I beg you. My mind is all I have. I've spent my whole life trying to fill it. Begin. I resign! Hilda! Hilda! Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Mm! Now, he showed promise. Papa! Papa! Mom! - Hold it there. - Reprogramme now? Yes. But don't fill him with anything above level three. I doubt if the human mind could take it. I understand. Level three only. There's something I have to attend to. Will you be able to manage without me? I'll try. I'll return. Begin to reprogramme. - Continue to level six. - Level six? I gave you an order. Programme the subject to level six. Try again. Your left hand controls direction, right does the altitude. And use your fingers too this time. Gently, darling. It's extremely sensitive. Like me. - What's that? - That's the planet Aquaria. Now take a left turn over Frigia, the next moon rising. Every moon of Mongo is a kingdom. My father keeps them fighting each other constantly. It's a really... brilliant... strategy. Why don't they team up and overthrow him? Team up? What does that mean? - Maybe I'll show you sometime. - Wonderful. - You can do that when I take you to Cythera. - Where? It's my secret pleasure moon. I have a little palace there, built just for two. - Wait a minute, Aura. - Oh, Flash, I saved your life. Drink this. - What is it? - It has no name. Many brave men died to bring it here from the Galaxy of Pleasure. It will make your nights with Ming more agreeable. - Will it make me forget? - No. But it will make you not mind remembering. Wow! This isn't bad at all. It's a thought amplifier. I'm going to think to Barin and tell him to expect us. - You're kidding. Think to him? - Of course. - Don't you have telepathy on Earth? - Hey! Could I call Dale on this? - If I showed you how. But I'm not going to. - Please, show me how to tune in to Dale. You'll have to persuade me much better than that. What are you doing? Are you mad? Let me go! We are diving into Frigia. - Pull her up! - Just tune me in to Dale. OK. Dale, it's me, Flash. Are you getting me? Over. Oh, my head! Oh, Flash, if it only was you. - She's not getting me. - Don't use your mouth, use your brain. I'm with you, Dale. Just concentrate hard and think to me. It's telepathy. Over. Can this be real? I saw you executed. I was saved. I'm still alive. Oh, thank God! - Where are you? - In a rocket, racing to Arboria to get help. - Are you OK? Over. - I'm locked in Ming's bedroom. - Fake him out. - How? - Girls know how, Dale. - It's been done to me. Fake him out till I get back. Over. It's too dangerous here. Stay where you're safe. Oh my God, this girl's really turning me on. I didn't quite get that. Think it again? Forget I thought it. - It wasn't about you. Over. - What? - Hang up. I've got to go. - Where? Someone's coming. Got to stop thinking to each other. His Imperial Highness will be here very soon. - Shall I pour? - Please. Wouldn't you like a sip? Oh, no, it's forbidden for us slaves. Ooh, believe me, honey, that's quality stuff! Have some. Listen, we're all girls here. I won't tell. Just one sip. Live a little, huh? Bottoms up. - What is your name? - Hans Zarkov. Agent Zarkov! Number 2133 of the Imperial Anti-Insurgent Espionage Group. Hail Ming. Good. It's not usually so bad this time of year. How far to the landing pad? 6.4. I'll drop the flaps a little. You? Hey! Over here! Hey, buddy! I've got her. - Where? - Section 409 beta. Activate Agent Zarkov. Oh! Dr. Zarkov! Are you a sight for sore eyes! - Easy, girl. Rest a minute. - No, I can't rest. We've got to get out of here and join up with Flash. - Flash? - He's alive. I talked to him by telepathy. He went to Arboria to get us help. Arboria? Incredible. - There's soldiers everywhere. What'll we do? - Let me think a moment. Unseal the city. Allow her to exit with Agent Zarkov. I think I can find a safe way out. - Are you sure? - No questions, dear. Just follow me. I have located Dale Arden. She's under the guidance of Agent Zarkov. - But Flash Gordon is still alive. - Alive? He was revived by a traitor and spirited from the city. We know this from the Earth girl. What traitor? I have my suspicions but I need your authority to pursue them my way. - Stop at nothing. - No matter to whom the trail leads? I said "at nothing"! - What's that over there? - Their sacred temple. A young man is being initiated. But we must hide outside till it's done. I love initiations. I am now of age, Green Father. I ask for the test of manhood. Choose your passage, into this world or the next. May Arbor guide you. Send me on my way. Spare me the madness! I will. Hold him. This guy is going to help me? Stay. That was extremely moving. - You came! - I do sometimes keep a promise. Prepare a feast! No, not for me. I have to get back right away, before I am missed. - Right away? Then why did you come? - I brought you a present. Flash? Hello. Welcome back from the grave. I knew you were up to something, though I confess, I hadn't thought of necrophilia. All I want you to do is keep him for me, until my father has had his way with Dale Arden. I'll keep him for you, all right! In my larder. Take him, along with the rest of the hanging meat! No, Barin. I forbid it. If you kill Flash, you'll never have me again. What danger is there? Everyone thinks he's dead. I swear, I'll take him away to Cythera next week. Harbouring a fugitive from Ming is treason. That's only an excuse, Barin. You're not frightened of Ming. - You are playing with fire, Aura. - Of course I am. Does anyone ever trust her twice? So that's why they let us escape. Klytus thought he'd wiped out your memory. - But do you know why it really failed? - I can't imagine! As I was going under, I started to recite Shakespeare, the Talmud, the formulas of Einstein, anything I could remember, even a song from the Beatles. It armoured me, girl. They couldn't wipe those things away. You can't beat the human spirit! Prince Barin! I'm not your enemy, Ming is. And you know it yourself. Ming is the enemy of every creature on Mongo. Let's all team up and fight him. Lower them into the swamp. We can do it, Barin! Your lover Barin is harbouring Gordon in Arboria, is he not? - No! - This lying is such a waste of time. You left with a pilot and returned alone. Wasn't he Gordon in disguise? - No! - Who do you imagine you're protecting? The Imperial Surgeon, who revived Gordon in his tomb? Another lover of yours? Your jealousy of me has made you mad! Seize the Imperial Surgeon on suspicion of treason. You're mad! - Prepare him for torture! - Confess and we won't hurt you any more. - We don't like doing this at all. - Never! Bring me... the bore worms. No! Not the bore worms! I'm a princess of the blood, Klytus. My father will have your head for this. I swear. He'll execute your whole perverted secret police force. I demand to see him! With pleasure. - Father? - The traitor is close to confession, your majesty. Should we stop the torture? - No. - Father! Damn you, Father! That damned woman's using me again. What do you expect of Ming's daughter? I never understood what you see in her. Keep playing your bloody pipes, fool. Fico, I'm going to kill Gordon now. And lose the Princess Aura for ever? There must be a way to dispose of the earthling - and keep faith with the Princess. - There is. - I'm sorry, Flash, I'm finished. - No, you're not. Get up. Look! Look, someone's coming. Send him over. Hurry up. Hold on. - It's no good, Flash. I can't hold on. - Yes, you can. Go on, get in. In! Sleep well, you traitor. We hang you in the morning. That's the spirit. There's always hope. There's better than hope. I stole the key to this cage. We'll need weapons to cross the swamp. They're stored in the temple. Want to climb up with me? Hold on, Hawkman. We'll be right back. Nice confession. I commend you. - Execute her? - No. Too kind. Aura will be banished to Frigia the day after my wedding. One year in a cavern of ice will cool her blood. And then... who knows? Perhaps we will marry her to someone worthy of her treacherous nature. Your Majesty, how can I express my gratitude? Easily, Klytus. Get me Gordon and Barin. With pleasure. Hans, look! - Hey, Vultan! - Not now. You're gonna love this. See what Brave Blue has caught. Hi, Prince Vultan. Remember us? Indeed I do, my lovely. Call the Emperor. Tell him I have prisoners for him. - You wouldn't! - Are you mad, Vultan? You hate Ming. I know you're only waiting for the right moment to attack him. Yes, and Ming knows that, too. So, by delivering you, I allay his suspicions. I gain time. Our weapons are inferior. We need another year's preparation. Ming's not unbeatable. With all his men, he couldn't even kill Flash. Gordon's alive? He's in Arboria. Prince Barin is aiding him. - Barin! - I tell you, now is the time to strike. - Where are the weapons? - Feel one. Do you know where you are? Up the creek. You have trespassed where only a Treeman may enter. A stranger in this temple must try the Wood Beast or die. That figures. You came of your own free will, earthling. However, because of my word to Aura, I swear by the great god Arbor I'll not kill you. Unless you beg me to. The beast lies somewhere in the stump. Choose a passage. No way. - Coward. - Let's do it. Must be my lucky day. Are you scared? What would Aura think of you now? Second down. Your play. No. Yours. - Are you sure these are the rules? - They've just been changed. God... God... Death is certain, but only after tortured madness. - How long? - Hours. Days. Depending on your strength. Please, end it now. Tricked you, Barin! Back off! One move and you're looking for a new prince. Leave him! He's mine. I hunt him alone. This is one grave you won't be returning from. Vultan wants a word with you, Barin. Excuse me for waking you. We scanned a Hawkman patrol 400 Mongo miles east. They have Gordon and Prince Barin. What's our arrival time at Vultan's kingdom? Estimating 16. - Wake me when it's in sight. - Yes, sir. - You'd sell us to Ming? - Come on, Barin. Do you expect mercy here? What would you do if I were captive in your kingdom? I would remind you of Article 17 of Ming's Law: "No prince of Mongo taken captive shall be offered for ransom "without first being given the right of trial by combat." - Is there such an article? - I'm afraid there is. What a damn nuisance. Hm. Yes. And... who do you choose to fight? Him. This place is a lunatic asylum. I wonder where we're being taken now. - Mmm, I'm calculating. - What? Time remaining before the moon crashes on Earth. I'd say, very roughly... 14 hours, 9 minutes and 20 seconds. Oh, God. And we haven't even found... Flash! Oh, it's so crazy! Last time I saw you I prayed it was a dream. This time I'm praying it's not. - Are you OK? - I am now. Me too. Boy, have I got some crazy stories to tell you! - Save 'em for our kids. - Oh, I accept. Enough! Would you leave us alone? I just got engaged! Let the combat begin! To the death! Kill! Kill! Kill! Give me the remote control. Come on! Zarkov, he's tilting it! Come on! Wa-hey! Flash! Watch out! You got him! - Present from Vultan! - Brute! Give me that. Bastard! Flash! Come on, Gordon, finish him. Get up! Get up, get up! Come on, Gordon! Come on! Punch him! Flash! Flash! Flash! Move! Don't stand there! Move! Flash! Flash! Flash, I love you! But we only have 14 hours to save the Earth. - Flash! - Come on! How's that feel, Arborian? Kill! Kill! Kill! Promise me, if you kill me you'll team up with Vultan and fight Ming. Goodbye, Barin! Take my hand. Come on! You've won! Let him go. Come on. You can do it. That's it, Prince. - What is this? - Humanity. - Madness! - Oh, Flash. Where you go, I follow. - Listen to me! Listen! - No! No! No! There is something finer in this galaxy than Ming's Law. Rubbish! Hawkmen, to your posts! Agent Zarkov, you will be liquidated for treachery. Vultan! You will surrender these fugitives at once, or the Imperial Fleet will blast your kingdom to atoms. - Step forward, Barin. - Address me as Prince Barin. No longer. Princess Aura, under our persuasion, has implicated you in high treason. You're under arrest. A prison ship will be here shortly to take you away. You tortured Aura. An interesting girl... I think she found it rather enjoyable. - Klytus. - Mm? Flash! The first step forward. Into the air, my Hawkpeople! Take whatever you can carry! Fly for your lives! You damn hothead! You've brought down destruction on my kingdom! No, Vultan! He has shown us the way. Stand with us and fight. Against the Imperial Fleet? It's the perfect time. They won't expect resistance. We'll take them by surprise. - We can do it, Vultan. - Ah, you're all mad! My duty is to protect my Hawkpeople. Evacuate! Fly! Then take us with you. Impossible. There's already much more than we can carry. - You're leaving us to die? - You know Ming's Law, Barin! Outside his own kingdom, the hunter becomes the hunted. - Traitor! - Save your breath, Barin! Evacuate! Fly! Dale, help me pull these down. We'll make parachutes and jump to Arboria. Flash, it must be 50 miles down. We'll kill ourselves. Oh no, no problem. A body reaches maximum velocity within a few hundred feet. We'll need some rope. Here. My God, what is that? Come on. It's Ming. He'll blow us to atoms. We must stop him. - Blast them? - Not yet. Send down a shuttle. Bring back Barin, Zarkov, Dale Arden. And Gordon? No, leave him there. Prepare my Imperial Lander. Why aren't I going with them? - I've got other plans for you. - I can imagine. - You want to destroy me. - I have to. It's the only way to save Earth. - What if I granted you a kingdom? - If you what? Ming the Merciless, ruler of the universe, here and now offers Flash Gordon a kingdom of Mongo, to rule over as his own. You're crazy. Why would you do that? Because I've never before met your like. You're a hero, don't you see that? Who better than you to rule a kingdom? Your moon is drifting very close now. Earth's end might come within hours. - You'd call off the attack? - I could. - Everyone would be saved? - Yes. And no. After the earthquakes and tidal waves, they won't be quite the human beings you remember. They'll be more tractable. Easier for you to rule, in the name of Ming. - You mean slaves? - Let's say they'll be satisfied with less. - What about Dale? - Dale? We have decided to marry her. She's exceptional. We will breed with her, and send our imperial progeny back to populate your Earth. You really prefer death to a kingdom? I'm disappointed. I'd much rather see you on my side than scattered into... ...atoms. But, as you wish. We shall return to the Imperial Rocket. Leave the earthling here to his doom. - Beam another blast. - You murderer. Flash. I loved you. - They were brave creatures, Vultan. - Shut up! With respect, the man who rid us of Klytus should not be deserted. Will you shut up? So... Maybe I'd do it different if I had it over again. Then fight! But there's no way I can help a man who's dead! Flash Gordon to Vultan. Do you read me? Mayday, mayday. Huh? This is Vultan. I read you. Where are you? Flying blind on a rocket cycle. Flying blind on a rocket cycle? Uh, we are in Arboria. - I'll send you a homing beam. - Thanks, Vultan. Hey, for what it's worth, Ming's got Dale, Zarkov and Barin. I see. My thanks to you. Yeah? What for? Well... For giving a dumb old bird a second chance! Over to homing beam. Woo-hoo! Don't touch me! - Oh, you! - Don't! I'm a prisoner too. You damn Mongo person! You couldn't tell the truth to save your life! Dale, stop! I'm going to be exiled in the morning. Liar! Oh, yeah? You liar! - Is this another trick, Aura? - Is this a trick? Could tears come from my eyes if my heart hadn't changed? I've been such a spoiled fool. I never knew what my father was... until he let Klytus put bore worms on me. I believe you, Aura. But I don't trust you. You have Ming's blood in your veins. You'll be cosying up with him again in the morning. Not if you give him this. It's deadly poison. My father always drinks a power potion before he makes love. - Drop this into his glass tonight. - I can't, Aura. - I gave your father my word of honour. - What word? To try and be a good wife... if he'd spare Zarkov and Barin. - He vowed he would. - My father has never kept a vow in his life. I can't help that. Keeping our word is one of the things that make us better than you. A guard will take you to the waiting room. Your joyous time has come. Follow us. You are to be prepared for your wedding. I'm lost, Aura. Nothing can save me now. ♪ Flash, ah-ah General Kala. Flash Gordon approaching. What do you mean, "Flash Gordon approaching"? On a Hawkman rocket cycle. Shall I inform His Majesty? Imbecile! The Emperor would shoot you for interrupting his wedding with this news. Fire when Gordon's in range. ♪ Flash, ah-ah He's escaping, idiot! Dispatch War Rocket Ajax to bring back his body. Charge the boosters. Flash Gordon in range, Captain. Fire! - Shall we go in after him, Captain? - No. Reduce velocity. Vultan! Our trap play worked. They'll follow me for sure. Good! Stand by, my Hawkmen! - He's not coming out, sir. - Charge capacities to electrify cloud. Prepare sky nets to catch Gordon's body. Fire capacitators. They're trying to flush you out. OK, let's go in after him. Good. They're coming through. Squadron 40... dive! Arm topside! Fire! Second wave. Dive! Stop all engines. Repel boarders. Biro's hit. I'm going in after him.

Pick that up, would you? Tell me more about this man Houdini. This is it, Zarkov. At least it'll be over quickly. Shh. Scanner malfunction, Area 7-7 Delta, under repair. They've changed the code. - I've changed, too, Aura. - And I've changed, too. Oh, it's OK, I think I can work it out. - I love you. Will you marry me? - I don't know. We'll try. - Not now, Barin! - You haven't changed! If I'm not at the wedding, I'll be shot. Ha! I thought it was one of the prime numbers of the Zeeman series! I haven't changed. ♪ Flash, ah-ah All right, everybody, take off! Form into a battle stream behind the rocket. Flash and me bail out when the shooting starts. And Biro, remember to keep your head down! See you in Mingo City, Prince! Yes... with luck! Flash, what are you setting there? That's how long Earth has left, according to Zarkov, in minutes and seconds. - Level with me, Vultan. Will this do it? - Yes, no doubt. There's a lightning field across the entrance. When this baby hits it: boom! All the fuel and everything, it will blow that field dead. My Hawkmen: phoo! Fly right in. Come, let's hear what Mingo City's saying. Oh, my God. - Rocket Ajax returning. - With Gordon's body? I presume so. Communications are off for some reason. Are they in the proper approach pattern for today? Negative. They are not. - Open fire! - On Ajax, General? Open fire! All weapons, now! Charge the lightning field. I take personal responsibility, in the Emperor's name. Attention, all wedding guests. There is no cause for alarm. The city's weapons are being fired in continuous salute, in honour of His Imperial Majesty's wedding. Come on, Flash. Come on! It's time to bail out. - Sorry, Vultan, I'm not coming. - What?! - The rocket cycle's gone. - So? Come on! I'll carry you. - Bail out, Vultan, before it's too late. - Flash, are you crazy? The fire's too heavy. You know we'll never make that opening with nobody at the wheel. - You'll be blown to pieces! It's suicide! - No. A rational transaction. - One life for billions. - Come on! You'll be destroyed! You loony bird! Get out of here. They need you on the ground. - Well, goodbye, Flash. It's been... - I know. For me too, Vultan. Tell Dale... I know it would've been good. That must be one hell of a planet you men come from! Not too bad. ♪ Flash, ah-ah ♪ He'll save every one of us Onward, my brave Hawkmen! Let this be known for ever as Flash Gordon's Day! Freeze, you bloody bastards! - Freeze! - Take us to Ming. We do not lead traitors to the Imperial Presence. We'll find a way. Grab an imager off one of those agents. Zarkov! - Thank you. - Rocket Ajax still approaching. Life-form scanners identify Earthling Gordon at the controls. We guarantee its destruction when it reaches the lightning fields. General Kala? General Kala, will you please show yourself on my screen? Let's go. Wait. We've got to deactivate the lightning field. Where are the atomic generators? There's no time. They're six miles underground. I'm heading for Sector Alpha 9. Hold the fort. There has to be a way of deactivating the lightning field. Heil Ming! Heil Ming! Heil Ming! Do you, Ming the Merciless, ruler of the universe, take this earthling, Dale Arden, to be your Empress of the hour? Of the hour, yes. - Do you promise to use her as you will? - Certainly.
