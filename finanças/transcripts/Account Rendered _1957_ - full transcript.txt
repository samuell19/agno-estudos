Marshall has a handbag sir but apart from a letter and a couple of receipts the rest of the contents are missing then it must have been robbery they left a diamond wrist watch and a diamond bracelet that could you give us a list of the contents of your wife's handbag no but I daresay I made one now thank you sir there is one other thing there was a slight turn address of the neck here would you know if by any chance your wife was wearing a bridge brooch yes cameo brooch I noticed it at TIA a large cameo she often when she was very fond of it thank you sir this way of you come in mr. Ainsworth sir sit down okay I have to ask you a few questions I can't believe it I just can't believe it I know I'm I'm sorry when did you last see your wife alive um mr. Ainsworth I'm asking you when did you last see your wife alive I know it's sudden but we must have your help in tracing her movements today yes yes I'm trying to think it was about teatime we had tea together she was then going round to see a friend of Miss Heywood about five o'clock so she's had she left the house about quarter to 4:00 hind I didn't see her again until so now why do you say or so she said had you reason to suspect she was lying then he'd certainly not but in few of what happened I'm wondering we can see miss Hayward later can you think of anyone who might want a Harley away and of course not she was very friendly with everyone can you think of any reason why she should have been on the heath after dark had she friends in that neighborhood I can't think of any you live on the other side of the heath when you say the other side to which side you refer but I naturally don't know in which direction my wife was walking but I think I'm safe in saying that we have many friends who live close to the heath on any sign what were you doing between teatime and 9 o'clock mr. Ainsworth after my wife when Dada where to my study till 6 o'clock and I got out my car and went round to see my business manager I'd go but Morgan I arrived about 6:15 and stayed until just before 9 o'clock we had business to discuss when you got home we were surprised to find your wife was still Oh naturally but you were an hour late yourself so your Butler said yes yes sir I had a great talk about mr. Morgan I mean rather forgot the time I suppose my wife forgot it too your wife was dead mr. Ainsworth owned every orphan ah sergeant Mary will take a detail statement family in the morning meanwhile we'll take some transport for you I'll get you home do you know why she was killed we have no time to find a motive yet we'd better make a thorough examination of the Heath at first light in the morning don't leave the house without letting us know where we can get you with her I know good night good night hello Gilman Robert here and the police been a senior please know why I can't get round here as soon as you can it's desperately urgent yeah well right well I'll get a texting come right away I'll be with you in about ten minutes no no walk here come in by the garden I'll leave the door I'll be my study right wha goodbye I could see them in the distance the two of them my first impulse was to beat man's brains out and I started often then I start to got hold of myself I thought perhaps he isn't her lover perhaps there's some other explanation I decided to wait till she got home and Challenger I see what she had to say I got back into the car I meant go straight home but I couldn't I drove out along a bit North Road held forever then I stopped after a bit i cooled off and turn around and I drove home I didn't kill her Gilbert I know that Robert was a grateful thing well it's it's unbelievable Carolyn I told the police I was at your flat from quarter past six to nine o'clock with you I was taking a chance on your being there but why didn't you tell him the truth what you told me how could I I was there when it happened they would have arrested me on suspicion please back me up I know it's a lot to ask no it isn't that after all you've done for me in the last 15 years it's not that it is I I don't think it's wise Robert I can't go back to the inspector now and tell him I was lying no I see that fortunately I was at home all evening so it is a possible alibi all right I agree yes I'll do it but our stories must agree well any prints the man may have made the rains washed out yeah there's nothing much to show up in this rough grass anyway only the imprints of a heeled seems to come up from the road to the pond then caught it on the way back mm-hmm it's hard the way she was talking about wasn't it then she got lost in the dark I will find out I want this area combed thoroughly and I want that pond dragged well for the contents of a handbag then think of his robbery dude no I was obliged comes he wanted that he's after anything was probably a letter or diary something would incriminate him he took a lot to cover up [Applause] surgeons reports come through sir asphyxia due to manual strangulation there was salt or anything like that estimated time of death sim vm7 checks in her book and watch a prince and a handbag so except around the lab says the murderer was wearing gloves they're sitting on some fragments material caught in one of her broken fingernails good week music - I got a fairy godfather here sir oh there's a camera bridge yes sir another nice girl with no men friend manager quit the police and get a job with the news of the world I got a list of the contents of a bag sir from a maid holy usual things I severed all gold all valuable turns worse collapse sir no as doc wood may be near him for a statement that's with the shock as a verse a fright [Music] have you any news inspector later mr.

Ainsworth to see my you wanna protect him who was the man I didn't know there were so many but if you think Robert found out murder did because mr. Ainsworth has an alibi miss Hayward I don't question it should I mrs.

Morgan you were going for good and you were taking half the bank we get you're a thief of nothing worse if you weren't blind about the code why did you try to get rid of it because I knew who you were looking for a dark grey overcoat how how did you know I read in the paper some threads were found in Lucille's needle threads yes but how do you know they came from the coat like that only the police knew that and the murderer you met her on the 8th engine yes I did but I didn't kill her I just met her I was only with her for a few minutes what's she blackmailing you yes you see I well some years ago I embezzled money from the bank I meant to pay it back indeed I could have done so but Lewis Hill discovered this and threatened to expose me if I didn't settle her debts for him she ruined my life for her constant demands and threats for money why did you tell her to keep it quiet I didn't kill her I met her on the heath yes I met her to give her the money I suddenly decided that I wouldn't give it to her I told her I haven't got it she'd wait she'd have to wait she was absolutely furious she again threatened to expose me to Robert but I am I said I didn't care a damn what she did I got beyond caring so I went away and I left her all I wanted to do is to get out of the country before she had time to give me away it was a struggle mr. Morgan she told your coat her nails were broken I know she didn't want me to leave her I pushed her off with my hand a cat didn't scratch her hand she scratch it into you no I scratched my hand on the pin of a brooch she wasn't wearing abrupt but she was wearing it I never painten headed Robert tell me that but I couldn't tell you that she was wearing it could I without revealing where I was with her there is a stain on it but that doesn't prove a thing Franklin must have give me back to her he must have he went back gave her back the brooch then he hung around waiting to see who she was meeting anyway later on the way to the road Ronald river and strangled her but why did he take the brooch back again hmm because he'd been seen with a brooch earlier at the coffee store if the birch was found on her body it proved he'd seen her again how did he get there in time [Music] if you took a shortcut across that sorry where you come on look it is it's him we got to the Haiti doctor truck that's our man come on [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank goodness none of the others were charged I thought the inspector was quite capable of it wasn't a bad writer well I better be going I don't want to be in America not long after orgies on business and it's best to go away for time anywhere well goodbye sir thank you again very much he will come back Robert yes I coming [Music] you
