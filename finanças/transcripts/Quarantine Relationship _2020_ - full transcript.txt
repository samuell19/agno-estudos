(mystical music) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. (tranquil music) - Hello. I'm Chief Williams and I'm here to help the city of Wilmington, North Carolina with an initiative we're calling Destroy 19. And what this is is that we are taking our own responsibility for stopping the COVID virus in our community. In order to do that, we're going to have to take some extreme measures. You will not be able to leave your home for any reason while this is going on. Emergency crews are standing by to help you with anything you could possibly need during this time. Also, we don't know how long this is gonna last so the county has informed me that utilities will run free of charge until this is over. And one last thing. I implore you do not ingest or inject over the counter disinfectant into your bodies. (tranquil music) (Diedre crying) - And if you snitch, I'll kill you. (somber music) (mellow hip hop music) (birds chirping) (ominous music) (somber music) - It's gonna be okay. We got this. - How are we supposed to live like this? - [Rashida] We already got rid of the thing. - Well none of this is over until it is gone and forgotten about. - I could take care of that. - You better. This is all your fault. - It may be all my fault, but you're reaping all the benefits. (mellow R&B music) * Insincere * Don't interfere * That's what you said * Ooh * Hold it in your heart * Like some souvenir * And don't volunteer * Said what I said * Don't want a life I live gotta do it my way * * Like Sonatra * What else you'd expect from a girl like her * * We walked a long road * You see them come you see them go * * And you see what you see going up going down * * Like the cyclone * Oh carousel - Deandre. - Diedre. My name is Diedre. - Deandre. Grow some balls. - [Diedre] Maybe you should grow a heart. (Rashida laughs) - That's why I like you. You're crazy just like me. (laughs) Oh, man. Mmm. I'm hungry. Want something? - No. I don't. - [Rashida] You don't want nothing to eat? - [Diedre] No. (mellow hip hop music) Elder Jeaves? - [Elder Jeaves On Phone] Who dis? - [Diedre] It's me, Diedre. - [Elder Jeaves On Phone] How can I help you? - I have a situation I need help with. I really can't explain over the phone. (mellow hip hop music) - Deandre? Your food getting cold. - [Elder Jeaves] Well how to you expect me to help you? - Look, I don't know but I'm in serious trouble. - [Elder Jeaves] I can't help. Members of the church won't send elders. - Idiot, this is life or death. - [Elder Jeaves] Hold on. Is this Jeremy? Boy, you can't fool me. I know that voice anywhere. - Yeah, yeah, it's me, Jeremy. Can you help me? - [Elder Jeaves] Help? You owe me $40. I need my money. You told me you'd pay me over a month ago. Is that why you ain't been to church? (mellow hip hop music) - I'm gonna have to eat your food if you took any longer. - [Diedre] How did I get here? - Hmm? Love. - Love. - L-O-V-E, love me. L-O-V-E, love me. - Not right now, aight? - What? It's always now. Like-- - Yo stop. - What's wrong with you? - I need to be calling my pastor. (Rashida laughs) - Huh, say that again, now. - What's so funny? I need to call my pastor. He's my friend. (Rashida laughs) - Wait a minute. So, you go to church and he's your friend, nobody calls you for this whole time. 'Cause I'm just trying to figure out something. That's your people in the church, right? But the only person I've seen here is me. So who did God send? Me or them? - Rashida, stop playing, aight? - Me or them? - Rashida, stop. - Who did he send? Me or them? - Look, you, aight? You. - Oh. (laughs) I thought so. - Look, we can't go nowhere, aight? - What do you mean I can't go nowhere? - We're on a statewide lockdown due to Corona. - I don't care about that. - Have you not been paying attention? We were on phase one, we're on phase two now, soon to be three, four. They're not playing around with this. - Wow. Yo, if that's the case, then what we gonna do with it? - You almost shot him. - Yeah, I'm out here patrolling, making sure that everybody's adhering to this quarantine order. They act like we didn't even have a quarantine order in effect. Making sure they're wearing masks like you're supposed to. Yeah, I hear you. I hear you. But we're not just gonna rush in there and arrest her until we get concrete evidence? (chatter on police radio) It's too risky. While the quarantine is going on, they can fix these roads, this is ridiculous. (chatter on police radio) Look, we've been after this family for a long, long time. Marcus is in there right now, in the house with Rashida to get the evidence that we need. - [Officer On Radio] Well this is what I think we need to do. We need to go ahead and get the SWAT team-- - Look, when Marcus gets the evidence, we can send Rashida-- why am I even telling you this? I'm the police chief, you do what I say. You follow my rules or you find yourself a new job. Fix these roads while this quarantine is going on. I need to find a new job. Not like this one. (dramatic music) - [Tia] Somebody help me. Help me please. Help me. She shot me. - Who shot you? - [Tia] She shot me. Rashida. She shot me. - I need help. Officer down. It's Tia, Marcus's wife. (mellow music) - You know, as long as it is in the room, we gonna have a problem. And the longer it's in the room, there's gonna be a bigger problem. Let's just go ahead and chop it up. - Hold on, now. Wait a second. - What? You all caught in your feelings? Let's just end it. It's over. - No, we can't do it like that. - [Rashida] Why? - Because that's cruel. - I see she done made you soft. And you never even knew the truth. - Know what truth? - You know what I mean, Deandre. - My name is Diedre. - You don't even know who you are. Move out of my way. - Listen! We're in a quarantine lockdown, aight. We can't leave this house. Stop eating all the food. - Did you just knock my sandwich down? (dramatic music) - Listen, we're gonna have to figure out something tonight. If we don't, then the whole neighborhood's gonna know about it. - [Rashida] So. We're just gonna dump it across the street and wait til after it gets dark tonight. - Listen, we don't really have much of a choice because if we don't handle it tonight, then we're not gonna get another chance. They're gonna be flooding the streets with the military soon. - Okay. So then we just do it tonight, like I said. (laughs) Remember when we first met? - Yeah. Yeah, I remember. - It was so beautiful. - What? - It was (laughs), it was beautiful. - Ay yo, didn't we meet at a McDonalds? - Yeah, but it wasn't like you was one of those guys pulling up on me at the club with one of those fancy cars. - What's so special about Micky Ds? - It's what you said, how you made me feel. (laughs) I remember when you said I was like a special gift to the world. Nobody's ever told me that. And when you said it, I know that you meant it. - Yeah. Yeah, you were special. You are special. You'll do great things. - And all those guys, they (laughs) used to try to size me up. You know, giving me gifts. But that didn't work. (laughs) But what you said, that meant a lot. It really did. - Wow. Now where have you been? - [Rashida] Huh? What? - Huh, what? No, where have you been? You see, now you're acting like the Rashida that I met that night at that restaurant. This is the Rashida that I know. And I'm gonna be honest with you, I walked into that place not expecting to meet someone so beautiful that shined so bright, that knocked me off my feet. Where you been? (Rashida laughs) (mellow music) (airplane engine) - Hey. - What? What's wrong with you? - [Rashida] It's a bunch of planes outside. You hear that? - Planes? What are you talking about, planes? You was all hard yesterday and now you're scared of planes? - Look, look, there's a lot of 'em. - Are you serious? - Yes. Go to the door. (plane engines) - Looks like phase one just started. - Oh, shoot. - What? - What are we gonna do about the room? - How did we sleep through all this last night? - You were playing freaking lovebirds, you got me all off my game. - Lovebirds? No, you had us drinking that alcohol last night, that's what had us out. - Man, whatever. - I told you this was real. (knocking on the door) (suspenseful music) - Somebody knocking at the door. - Let's go see. - Shh! - What do you mean, "shh?" - Just be quiet and then they'll leave. - Yeah, somebody's definitely at the door. Let's go see. - Shh. Mmhmm. - What's wrong with you? - You know we got it in the room, why you gonna let somebody in? - Look, they already know. They already know. - They know what? - They know that we're in here. We gotta answer it. Why are you acting so scared for? You scared of planes and a door knock-- - Shh! You said the Coronavirus, why we gonna let somebody in? - Hold on. (suspenseful music) - Shh! (knocking on door) Can I help you? - Yes, ma'am. We're from the local police department. With the pandemic and everything going on, we're just coming around to check to make sure you're okay. - Okay. We don't have time for that right now. Thank you. - Whoa. What are you doing? - Can you move your foot? - Excuse me, I don't mean to give you a hard time, but you're already coming to the door with no mask on, hands kinda ashy so I can tell you ain't got no hand sanitizer, and I could've sworn I heard a male voice when you opened the door. - What does that have to do with the lockdown? - [Officer] Well I'm just curious. I mean, why didn't he come to the door. Are y'all hiding something? - No. Why do we have to hide something. Just because my husband didn't answer the door, we gotta be hiding something? - [Officer] So you and your husband live here? - Yes! - And this is your house? - [Rashida] Yes. - And may I have your name please, ma'am? - [Rashida] Can you move your foot please? - May I have your name please, ma'am. - [Rashida] Elizabeth Robinson. - So why does my paperwork say Deandre and Paula James? Excuse me, ma'am. But I'm gonna have to check the premises. - Can you back up please? - [Officer] Can you please put on a mask and get some hand sanitizer? - Excuse me, sir. Let me talk to my wife for a minute, okay? - You don't have a mask either. - Do not let him in. - What are we supposed to do? We gotta do something. - Why did you let him in here? - If we didn't, we'd look suspicious. - Look at him going through everything. Why he in the refrigerator? - Just chill out, man. This is what they do. - Excuse me, Officer. - Y'all got something to drink? - Why you got your mouth on my juice? - Listen, ma'am. First of all, this ain't even Fiji. I don't even know what this is. Number two, I'm just here doing my job. And I come in here, you ain't got no mask on, no hand sanitizer, and a half a roll of toilet tissue. I coulda been took you in a long time ago, but I ain't like that. See, your problem is, you worrying about the wrong thing. What you need to be worried about is why that man sitting on your leather couch in nothing but his drawers. - Why you taking my water? - I tell you what, you tell him to put some pants on, go to the store, and get you some water. Oh, I forgot, it's a lockdown. He can't. (maniacal laugh) (suspenseful music) - Wasn't that weird? - What? - If he was supposed to be coming here to check us for Coronavirus, he didn't check our temperatures. He was like, snooping around the house. - That's just how they do. - Mm-mm. Like, did you see he even went by the door where it is. He kept looking at us like... You think he know? Somebody... I don't know, nevermind. - Either way, we have a problem. What if this lockdown is for weeks? - Maybe we can chop it up. Into little, small pieces. - No. No, we can't do it like that. - That's the only way we can get it out of here. - Look, I said no. - Maybe we can figure out a way to burn it. - Really? So that's an option right now? That is my dead wife in that room. (eerie music) (Rashida laughs) - Oh, okay. Now I see. It's not how, it's who. - [Diedre] Don't do that. - But you said you loved me. - I do love you. - No, it's to me, it feels like you still love her. - Ay yo, don't put your hands on me. Calm down. Calm down. - You liar! - I'm not a liar. - You lied to me. - Listen, I did not lie to you, all right? - You're the only man that told me that you loved me and I believed you. - I do love you, okay? Just never stopped loving her. - You still love her. Stop playing with my heart, Deandre. I guess you didn't even know she didn't love you. - And how you know that? (Rashida laughs) - I know more than you think. - You don't know nothing. - Oh. - If you do it, then I'll snitch. (mellow music) - [Rashida] Tomorrow, I'ma get whatever is in here to chop your wife up like a turkey. (mellow music) You said you was gonna snitch on me. - Whoa. You don't want to do this, okay? You wanna shoot me? Me? Baby, you love me. I love you. Drop the gun, okay? Drop the gun. Drop, drop it. (mellow music) (Rashida crying) It's okay. (mellow music) It's okay. - I love you. And we gonna be together forever. - You know, when this is all over with, I want us to leave the country together and live our best lives. - Yes. (laughs) (somber music) - What was that that you gave me? - Something to help me live my best life. (laughs) - I thought that you loved me. - I do. But I love me more. Let me make this a little easy for you. (somber music) - [Diedre] What you doing? - Waiting for you to wake up. - You were planning to kill me, huh? - If I wanted to kill you, I woulda done that already. Besides, I can't kill my baby daddy. - [Diedre] Your what? - I can't kill my baby daddy. - So, what are you trying to say? - My baby daddy gotta be the dumbest man ever. - You're pregnant? - Yes. - Why you lying for? All that coke and alcohol? So how I know it's mine? - What? The one thing I know I never did to you and that was cheat on you, unlike your wife. - [Diedre] And what is that supposed to mean? - Oh, gosh. You so gullible. (laughs) Everybody knew that, even I knew that. That was a perfect opportunity for her. You know that? When she found out about me and you. Why you think that she came home early that day? - No, you see, you're lying. My wife loved me. - Oh, oh. - My wife, she loved me. - So, is this you in this video? - [Diedre] Nah. - [Rashida] I'm out. - [Diedre] Don't kill the baby. - [Rashida] Ugh! * You told me we would be together * * It sounded like it was forever * * Your phrases make me feel better * * About our love the stormy weather * * You said I was the only one * But you got me the only once * I see I'm not the only one * Who's feeling like the only one * * Some call it stupid some say I'm an addict * * I'm hooked on the stories you make help me * * Some say I'm clueless but that's just not true I know * * Just what I'm doing I'm hooked on * * Your beautiful lies * You love me you need me * I'm beautiful the only one * And baby you're the only one * Who makes me feel * Like I am one of a kind * When you tell me those beautiful lies * * You say baby I won't hurt you no lie * * Please trust me * You always put it on your life * * And I may be too dumb to call you on your lies * * There's no one to wait 'cause I keep getting trust * * Some call it stupid some say I'm an addict * * I'm hooked on the stories you make * * On the stories you make * Some say I'm foolish but that's just not true * * I know just what I'm doing I'm hooked on your * * Beautiful lies * You love me you need me * I'm beautiful the only one * And baby you're the only one * Who makes me feel * Like I am one of a kind * When you tell me those beautiful lies * * Some call it stupid some say I'm an addict * * I'm hooked on the stories you make * * I'm hooked on the stories you make * * Some say I'm clueless but that's just not true I know * * Just what I'm doing I'm hooked * - You know, all the work we've put in to get this quarantine going and people just driving around like it doesn't even exist. Oh, you look well for losing all that blood. Guess it didn't hit any vital organs. How you doing? - I'm holding up. - Good. Listen, Tia, I got a question to ask and it's a serious question, I need an honest answer. - Anything, Chief? - [Chief Williams] What were you doing in the house while the investigation was going on and Marcus was there? - I was trying to grab something before it happened. - Tia, I need an honest answer. What was going on? - What was going on? You have my husband in my house with some skank doing who knows what, claiming it's a part of the investigation? Was this a part of your plans, Chief? - Tia, you know everything we do, we do for the A-Team. - The A-Team. I must not be a part of the A-Team. You got my husband pretending to be in a relationship with some woman. Nobody asked me how I felt about it. She tried to kill me. (suspenseful music) - [Rashida] What? What is it? - They're checking houses. Yeah, it says they have 2500 troops checking houses. If you don't let them in, they can force themselves in by law. Every house will now require a full search. Full search may be what it takes to get control of the Coronavirus. Search begins now. - So if they're beginning now who was that guy that was here earlier searching the house? - I have no idea. I just got this feeling that somebody's on to us. - How can they be on to us if it was just you and I? We didn't tell anyone, right? We didn't tell anyone, right? - Right. Why would I tell on myself. - Yeah. We gotta go ahead and chop her up. - After all of this, you still talking about chopping her up? - What else you have in mind? - Nah. Just... Just give me a few minutes with her. - You got five minutes. Five. (ominous music) Five minutes. I said your time is up. (ominous music) It's time. - I cannot do it. - [Rashida] You have no choice. (dramatic music) - [Diedre] I can't. - By tomorrow, the body will be stinky. - I can't. - You have no choice. Do it or die. (dramatic music) (knocking on door) (knocking on door) (Diedre muffled talking through hand) Shh. (suspenseful music) (Rashida exhales) - At least she's alive. - What? What did you say? - [Diedre] Nothing. - Oh, so you think I didn't hear what you said? - Look, I'm glad that she's alive, aight? There, I said it. So what? - If she's alive, then that means we go to prison, idiot. - You know, maybe we should just call the cops and turn ourselves in. - Man, I tell you. Besides sex, you're useless. - Let's call her phone. If she answers, at least we know something. - Mm-mm. I don't know about that. No, mm-mm. Okay. We gonna call but we gonna call from your phone. - [Diedre] Okay, all right. - Wait a minute. Now you a little bit too happy to make that call. (Diedre sighs) (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) (undistinguishable chatter on phone) - Babe? - Don't say anything! - What, why? - Because we don't even know anything. Like, why would you do that? I don't even-- oh my gosh. (suspenseful music) There's no way I can get myself locked up. I can't. I can't do it. I can't do prison time. I would just be like everybody else in my family. (soft piano music) We should just make a run for it. - Have you not been paying attention to the alerts on your phone? 14 people got shot and killed for running. - If they come back, it's because she told 'em. Either way, we screwed. - Yeah. They come back for another check-up. - We gotta clean that bedroom. - I'm not going back in there. I can't. (Rashida sighs) - [Rashida] What was that? (Diedre sighs) - The power went out. Look like everything except the street lights. - What you think? Are they coming to get us? - Yeah. I think that it's over with. I think that they're coming to get us. (tranquil music) Quarantine's not supposed to be like this. - Neither are relationships. - I think that we should call our families. - [Rashida] You really don't know me. I don't have a family. - Like literally? - I mean, I was adopted and my family's in Maine but I haven't talked to them in like, 15 years. - Well if you're not gonna call anyone, then I'm not gonna call anyone either. - No. No, no, no, no. If you got family and you wanna call them, go ahead and call them. Don't do it because of me. - I mean, I doubt they'll care anyway. They pretty much disowned me after I married her. - Wow. She was trouble at the start, huh? (suspenseful music) What you gonna do with that? - I think we should tell our story. I mean, think about it. My wife is gonna tell her story, the police are gonna tell theirs and so is the media so we owe it to ourselves to tell ours, right? - You got a point. Give it here, I'll go first. (suspenseful music) Hi. My name is Rashida Hamilton. I was abandoned by my teenage mom but then I was adopted by a rich, white family in Maine. It was everyday I was either molested or raped by a white man in my community. I mean, I reached out for help but no one wanted to help this little Black girl. So I ran away. And I ran away to Atlanta. (laughs) Here, they taught me how to survive. Even taught me that being a Black girl was a cool thing. Then I ran into this amazing guy, horrible name. I don't know if his parents was on crack or not, but, (laughs) he still was amazing. He was so amazing that I... I killed his... I killed his wife. Maggie Simmons. That's how amazing he was to me. Your turn. (mellow music) (Diedre sighs) - How do I follow that? - I mean, that was my story. You tell yours. - Yeah, but I think I need some inspiration first. - Only if you let me tie you up one more time. It is quarantine, right? - Yeah. - Let's have fun in this quarantine relationship. (dramatic music) - Sorry to interrupt. - Get her. She killed my wife. - [Rashida] She? We killed her. What is this? - Get her, I have the evidence on my phone! - Okay, we got this Marcus. - [Rashida] Marcus? (Marcus laughs) - Oh yeah. - [Rashida] Marcus! - [Marcus] I said my name is Diedre, but it's Marcus and I'm an undercover cop. - Hey, hey, hey! (Marcus laughing) - [Marcus] I'm an undercover cop and so was my wife. - I will blow your frickin' head off. - [Marcus] Good thing she had that vest on. - But I love you! - You're under arrest. - She don't love you! - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. - You're gonna pay! - If you cannot afford an attorney. - [Rashida] Deandre! Marcus! - It's Diedre. (Marcus sighs) She's crazy. - Boy, I tell you. You. - Man, why you didn't get her the first time you came through? - Man, I didn't know what was going on. You here making all them faces, sitting here in your drawers. I was confused. - Man, look. I had to do something with her one more time. - Boy, stop it. Bet you didn't even have a mask, though. I need to lock you up. - No six feet. (laughter) But look, I gotta give it to you, man. You caught on quick with them signs. - Hey, man. Stay ready ain't gotta get ready. I studied all night. This Jeremy? Boy, don't you owe me $40? (laughter) (tranquil music) (traffic sounds) - What's going on there, hero? - Hey, what's up? - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Social distancing, remember? Six feet apart. - Yeah. Yeah, my bad. I forgot. - I thought you went on vacation yesterday. - My wife thinks I did. - Okay? Well you didn't come here to chit chat so what's going on? - The case. There's something I can't get past. - [Chief Williams] You fell in love with Rashida for real this time. - What? No. No, it's nothing like that. - [Chief Williams] Okay, then what is it then? - Well Rashida, she showed me this video of my wife. - Oh, yeah. I saw that video. You guys went all out to make that look real. - See, that's the thing, bruh. That wasn't me in that video. - Wait, what? - Yeah, that video was real, but that wasn't me in the video with her. - No. No, your wife wouldn't do that to you, man. - Okay, well if it was something for the case, then why don't I know anything about it? - Wait, hold on. Let me take this phone call real quick. Williams. Wait, what? When? How much? You've gotta be kidding me. All right, I need a man on that right away. And you keep me informed as to what information you find out on that. And while I got you, hey, you know that video? Yeah, that video. Got any information on that? Email address, anything? Really? Okay, well thanks a lot. And remember, keep me abreast of everything that goes on with that missing money. Okay, so apparently, this originated from an A-Team Jeremy's email. I mean, we're A-Team. Do you know a Jeremy? - A-Team? - [Chief Williams] Mmhmm. - Jeremy? - [Chief Williams] Mmhmm. - Yo, I gotta go. (ominous music) - Where you at? Whatchu mean? I'm at your house now, ain't nobody here. Psh, girl. I done stole this money, we gotta get out of town. I ain't got time for you to be playing around. (suspenseful music) Whatchu mean? I'm at your house now, I got the money. Nobody's here. Listen, girl. I done stole this money, it's only gonna be a matter of time before the whole police force will be after us. Marcus? Nobody worried about Marcus. Divorce him, do whatever you gotta do. He's not a factor. Listen, listen. Just meet me by the lake in 30 minutes. (suspenseful music) Let me call you back. Psh. Marcus. Boy, you gonna live a long time. You know I was just thinking about ya? - Really? (suspenseful music) Whatchu doing here, man? - Whatchu mean, man? I came to see if you wanna get a drink or something. I gotta have a reason to see my boy? - Your boy? - [Calvin] Yeah, boy. - Oh, okay. So I'm your boy now. - What's all this about, Marcus? - See, see, the thing is I heard something different. - Yo, I don't know what you think you mighta heard, mighta not heard, but you got it all wrong, man. This is A-Team. - I got it wrong? The A-Team? Tell me what it is then, Calvin. Tell me what it is. Because what I think is you been smashing my wife behind my back. Yeah, I seen the video. Before you try to lie, I seen the video. - I just messed up, man. I just messed up. - If I was you, I would be very careful the next words I let come out of my mouth. - Blue lives matter, Black lives matter, we all matter, baby. Let's just take a knee and talk about this. - Did my wife matter? Did my life matter when you smashed my wife? (dramatic music) - Not much fun when the rabbit got the gun, huh? (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) - Calvin. - [Chief Williams] What's going on, Chief? - You tell me what's going on. - This don't concern you. Wherever you came from, I advise you to go back. - What do you mean it doesn't concern me? I just came from Marcus's house. - I'm pretty sure he done told you everything you need to know. - Calvin, we're cops. We're better than this. - No, you're better than this. This is my way out. If you don't turn around and go the other way, I promise the next suit you wear gonna come with a hearse. - You're a good man, a good cop. I brought you onto the A-Team for a reason. - Yeah, you did bring me on the A-Team. But I made the A-Team. I the one that took them sacrifices and what I got to show for it? Not a pinch in the 10, 15 year. My son 10 years old. I can't wait on that. - I'm giving you one last chance. Put the gun down, hand me the bag. (Calvin laughs) - You know, that was Marcus's mistake. He thought I wouldn't shoot him either. (somber music) (Chief Williams sighs) - Was it worth it, Calvin? (somber music) Dispatch. I lost him. Meet me down at Carolina Beach Road. (suspenseful music) Folks, it's been four months since the lockdown started and the city is starting to get back together. That's the good news. But since then, we've run into a few problems. Several officers have been killed and money is missing. We have no clues, no leads. (suspenseful music) I just wanna say, these are good people. They had families. You didn't have to shoot 'em down like animals. (suspenseful music) These officers... These officers were friends of mine. They did not have to be killed like this. (suspenseful music) I'm sorry. This isn't-- I can't, we can't do this.

Hopefully, it will help you. So this time, what I wanna speak with-- or the third time-- what I'm gonna speak about is understanding the difference between being employed, self-employment, and running their business. There's this big entrepreneur spirit because of the internet and the information people have and everybody wants to become an entrepreneur now and everybody wants to make a bunch of money and all these different things and all those things are actually great if you're in the right space when doing that. The goal is not really to make a bunch of money. The goal is to have personal freedom and thrive. So, just because you become self-employed does not mean you have personal freedom and does not mean you will thrive. A lot of people thrive in employment, working for someone. A lot of people thrive in running a business and have personal freedom in that. So, my whole point is, I hear a lot of people complain about hating their job and hate working at their job and yadda, yadda, yadda. They're like, they just hate being there. But I think that's your perspective that has messed everything up. Your job prepares you for your success. It prepares you to get in a position to thrive, it prepares you to get in a position of personal freedom, it prepares you to make money and pass jewels down to your family. So instead of going to your job, hating your job, understanding that your job is a training ground. Self-employment is transition. Business is when you are thriving. We could say that as thriving. But you must understand don't be such in a rush to be self-employed and start your business if you haven't conquered employment. And what I'm saying is, a lot of people want to be self-employed, a lot of people want to leave their job but when you're employed, they tell you what to do, when to do it, how to do it, and they guarantee you a check. But when you're self-employed, none of that stuff is guaranteed. You have to just get up early enough, work late enough, and you just have to keep going hoping the job is done. When you're running the business, you're putting the responsibility onto somebody else. So my point is, when you're working for somebody, if you can't... If they're telling you what to do and how to do it and you can't be to work on time everyday and you can't work to a high level and you know what you are to be doing, how are you going to do that for yourself? How are you gonna be self-employed and do that for your own business? If you don't become a great employer-- excuse me, a great employee-- how are you gonna be able to hire great employees? You don't know what that is. And so, and I'm really speaking to the people that take their job for granted and don't give 100% for their job because they know it's not their last stop, they know it's not their goal, but it's a part of the process and you have to master each step to get to the top. Once the game starts, that's not when you learn, that's not when you start doing right, that's when the habits of everything you've done in the past kick in. I'm sorry if the camera's shaking. I don't have it on a gimbal, but. So it's very important while you're at your job, be the best employee you can be. This is training ground to run your business and you're walking for a business, whether you think it's a good business or bad, there are always lessons and rules to learn. So while you're at your job, you need to know the company's profile, you need to know the company's customer profile, you need to know why y'all working eight hour shifts and not 12 hour shifts. You need to know why you work Monday through Friday, not seven days a week. You need to know why y'all take breaks, 15 minute breaks to the 30 minute breaks. A supervisor job comes up and people are applying for the job. You should be able to guess who is going to get the job but you need to understand the business that you are working with. 'Cause this is practice for running your own business. This is not a place to get your head down, this is not a place to try to get over, this is not a place that when you come there, you come in just enough time to still get paid, you leave just early enough to still get paid. No, this is your practice. This is your habits. No matter what you do in life, you are creating a habit. So if you're not trying to eat healthy, every time you don't, you are creating the habit of not eating healthy. Every time you try to eat healthy, guess what you are doing. You are creating the habit of eating healthy. So every time you go to work and you don't give it 100%, you are creating a habit in your life of not giving 100%. If anybody has ever played sports before, one thing a coach will always tell you during practice is to practice full speed so when you're in the game, you don't have to try. It's like muscle memory. That just the habits, that's what practice is for. Game time is not a time to learn, game time is a time to execute. So when you're at work is the time to learn so when you get your own business, you can execute. This is very, very important and I just, I feel like there a lot of people that need to hear this because they wanna start a business and do different things but they don't know how to be great for a business. They don't know how to help a business grow. I'ma end by saying this. One of the biggest things I have learned, one of the biggest things is, when I go to learn something, I don't-- and let's say if I work with somebody else or helping them with their project and, you know, I wanna learn. The best way to learn, the best way to create your habits is to not go there and do what most people do that I have seen, snoop around, look at equipment, snoop around, they try to go and copy what they're doing. The habit you are trying to get when you go help somebody is making something great. So when you go help somebody else with their film, when you go help somebody else with their salon, when you go help somebody else with the barber shop, you go help somebody else with their computer business or their delivery business, your job is to help that business be the best it can be while you are there. Because when you start your own business, that is the habit that you are carrying over. So, you know, this ended up being longer than I thought it was but yeah, hey, hey. Always give 100%. That's the bottom line. No matter what it is, how it is, what you're doing, just make sure it's good, it's righteous, and give 100% every time. Be blessed.
