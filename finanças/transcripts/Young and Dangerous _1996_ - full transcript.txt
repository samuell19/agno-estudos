Fucking... I should have sold you as a hooker Buddy, we need to talk We're not buddies. You out rank me You're very humble What do you want? Work for me It would hardly be a betrayal of Bee Do you understand the meaning of righteousness? The world for righteousness. Loyalty equals foolishness Loyalty can be a sword right through the heart Nowadays, no one loyal If the lesson's over, I'll be off I haven't finished Here's $200,000 It's so that Bee can save face. Tell him you're the leading man in my next film After filming once or twice, you'll naturally become my man In the triads everyone can get rich suddenly I want to take it but my hand won't let me Are you still holding a grudge?

Jesus is a leader who doesn't demand that you fight or earn money for him Leave your criminal pasts behind Turn over a new leaf He won't despise you for it You don't say? Jesus had many followers to those who were willing to follow him, He was generous. You know he fed the 5,000? Have a candy. Yet he was betrayed by one of his own men And Peter denied his Lord three times, but Jesus didn't punish him Then Jesus was stupid. My men wouldn't be that dumb. He's the exception Fuck you! Chicken! Run! What?! Do you know who Ho Yan's dad is? Who? Wai, who rules Kuen-chung! He can kill a horse with one punch Does he have the guts to come to Wanchai? Should we be scared? Let's go fight him! Chill out, have a drink Chicken! Are you chicken? I am Come and speak with me Uncle Come here! Everyone sit down So she's leaving the family... Be honest Have you been screwing her? If so, be sure to wear a condom Sure, sometimes I wear two Next time, wear three! What are you saying? Shut up! You shouldn't encourage pre-marital sex Get lost! It's not a good example to set Shut that old kook up Hung Hing boy, don't disgrace me. Mr Chiang and I are friends Well, I'm leaving Take your hands off! Visit your mum. She misses you Stop nagging.

I'll treat you to what you want Hi You're with that girl? Brother Nam You're all here He's just met his future in-laws Is Jesus as brave as him?

Run Gang fight in progress Don't move! Police, scram! Nam, get in! Boss, we're in trouble! You call yourself our boss? My brother's dead! Fuck you! Hundreds of armed men ambushed us Where were you? My brother died!! What do we do? Chou-pan's dead I don't know about Nam Brother Keung, it's fixed Brother Kwan. Brother Kwan. Is everything ready? Yes, the girl is drugged Take this And keep a steady hand I want it all on film Why frame them? It would be a lot less effort simply to kill them all When you do the thinking, I'll retire Chiang thinks lot of him, but if I frame him He'll be kicked out of the society Well distribute the tape and he'll be in deep shit Feed him more pills Dope them as much as they can take He is a venomous snake... What did you say? I've got good ears so don't talk behind my back If they perform well, make me a copy of the tape It'll be good home entertainment Ok Why are you here? I don't know We made love... You took me. I won't let you go Forget what happened last night! What did I do wrong? Don't follow me! Where are you going? It's none of your business I can't wait for you A packet of cigarettes, please That will be $14 At 6am this morning, a man was murdered in a gang fight The police suspect that the victim Was a Hong Kong triad member They have no leads to go on at present Where are they? Where's Chicken? Shut up! Brother Nam! Nam... I called Brother Bee What did he say? He told us to lay low I want my brother's body A triad is prepared for jail or hell Foreskin... Stop! Are you crazy? We followed Bee and we haven't regretted it We killed Ba-pai. We were great. What about his family? They felt the way you feel now Bastard! We were attacked. Where were you? My brother was hacked to death. Say something! I'm sorry... You're sorry! I didn't know the job had started early... They are just words Why did you just leave me? Get lost! I'm talking to him I was raped, you fool! What did you say? I was given a drug. Then Nam raped me! You! What is she talking about? What is she talking about? I was framed... It's true! You screwed my girl! You son of bithch We were torn to pieces! Where were you? We were set up understand? Chou-pen was killed! Cut the crap! We are no longer brothers Bastard! Chicken! What a mess... You're still here... So? It's sorry, if Nam wants you here Brother Uncle Your sister-in-law made some pig liver soup Woman, do something with this You must hide out for now. How's Chicken? He doesn't return my calls. You have to explain things to him Yee... We must find Chicken I've looked with Ah Cheung It's spilled... Useless woman You fail at domestic work Sorry, I'll make some more So, you're dating the stammerer? Chicken How is the boss? Nam's wound is like this You love to exaggerate. A woman's taking good care of him Who? Not Ho-yan! It's the stammerer What are your plans? Lay low with cousin Blackie in Taiwan Here... Take this Nam told me to give it to you Take it... You'll need money You'll be a stranger. You'll need something to sell in an emergency Anyway whatever happens Just take care Woman, what are you doing? It's okay... Don't you know how to do it? Cut the ginger and put it int the water to get rid of the smell Cut it this way. Later, you have to say I cooked it Ok... How are you feeling? Better now But the wound is still painful... That's enough Let's go home... I was wrong. It's really painful I'll be better off in bed You know, you are different to the other triad guys It hurts, don't do that What's up? Isn't it fake? It's a tattoo. See, this looks alive Do all triad members have tattoos? Most of them People think everyone with a tattoo is in a triad Guess who loves tattoos most Triads, I suppose American sailors Why? During the war. If a corpse was disfigured It were hard to identify If there was a tattoo, his family could spot him easily So if you see someone dead with a dragon on his back... Don't say such unlucky things! I need you What are you doing? I need some help walking to the toilet Disgusting! Someone is watching, sex maniac Thanks for caring for me Cut the crap You're pissing everywhere Last time I was in Macao, I went straight to a nightclub. I've screwed some sexy girls But the one I met was really great Still, I wasn't satisfied, so I went to the Prince Disco I had this Brazilian girl. The kind of girl you can't hold with one hand. Great tits and gold hair Brother Kwan Brother Kwan Kei, you're so early! You must have waited ages... ...Although the boss is so lewd He's probaby screwing a girl as we speak I could have been loan-sharking We're waiting here like fools! Mr Chiang! Mr Chiang Sorry I'm late. We just got here You're not late... Mo, how's business in Tuen Mun? Good, come for a drink some time If you have the time we can play mahjong Yes, if you have time we can play mahjong Uncle Hing's son is studing Law, We need men like that All right Is he in a triad? Not yet Do you want him in yours? Okay... The bosses are all here, so we can begin... ...Perhaps with an explanation of this Macao business My men would follow Their orders to the death... They tried their best, but... Beautiful words, but worthless. The truth is that you failed Mr Chiang, it had to be a set-up, otherwise my men... Our reputation has been damaged Fortunately, I've now killed Fat Dog Don't provoke me You have to accept responsibility How do you train your men? Bee's getting it this time... You say that, but Keung is your man! It's not your place to speak here! In front of the Assembly, all men are equal Right... But respect your betters Bee... Take him out! As a leader, you should teach your men a few lessons in respect Quite finished? We're family, we're in this together Bee, it's okay to fail constantly What do you want? I'm simply stating the facts The society must punish his failure No matter what his rank, he is responsible Just keep talking Of course, you're used to that chair And we've all profited for years I think we need a new leader Kwan does make a lot of money for us. He's made a big contribution You want my place? Your term is over. Yiu should we elect a new leader? We should Kwan, what are you saying?! Over the years I've contributed a lot You all know that Brother Chiu, we grew up together In 1978, we became famous in a gang fight, remember? Right In 1983 I killed Sha-pi To get back the fishing concession In 1985 I killed Chan Kei I went to jail for three years My reward should be that seat Of course And if my buddies need my help I'll always be there for them He does always help us out. He's contributed a lot It must be hard to sit in an air-conditioned room and run things But we do the work, you know? 1997 is coming And voting is popular. If you want someone else to take over. I'll give up this chair You can attack me but not Mr Chiang! I'll settle with you over Macao. That's my responsibility! Sure, you'll pay Sit down! You will oversee the election Each boss should have one vote to cast right You have two minutes to decide who you wish to support If you support Kwan, simply raise your hand Uncle, it is no matter who will be the chairman. Yes... It's best if we just follow the others Kwan has my vote Kwan is right: The most capable man must take the seat Cast your vote now What's wrong with you all? Lower your hands! Keep a grip on yourself Bastard, I'll chop your hand off! Be careful what you say The election is over. I accept the result Kwan, take this seat Brother Chiang, I respect you You are still boss for now and you have to settle something This tape is the talk of the city Our man Nam is smart... He acted in an X-film And screwed the girl of his brother He wants to ruin us! He screwed a fellow triad's girl I think we deserve an explanation I'm sorry, but this is a frame But I am responsible for letting down my brothers and wronging Chicken You condemn yourself. Chiang, what do you think? It is against all the laws of the triad Even the emperor must obey the law. Triad punishment What, can't you do it? Boss... Nam is expelled from his triad gang He lives quietly, running a small bar When will you come back? Not while Kwan is leader The bastard is driving me mad. Hung Hing is a big society... Yet I'm the only one to oppose him I know... You can't stay here. You were born to be a triad Bo and Cheung are capable men They're no match for you I've followed you since I was a kid But I was framed. What will happen if I work for you again? You're right. Your sister-in-law wants me to emigrate I'm a gang leader with a criminal record. How can I go abroad? I need your help looking after my concerns in Causeway Bay. Let me think about it Boss, have some food Come on, try this Priest, think you can beat this? I'll be the judge! Foreskin! Foreskin! Beat him! Will you go back to Causeway Bay? Do you want me to? You're getting older. Are you going to stay here for the rest of your life? So, if I'm not a Triad, I'm nothing I didn't mean that What did you mean? Why do you stay with me? Because you're great in bed What? You're a great love-maker! Speak up! You're a great love-maker! Hey, come back! Boss Uncle Bee What are you doing here? Kwan wants to talk to you We have nothing to say Really... Look familiar? What kind of stunt is this? Come and find out. Get in Must we meet like this? You can't have time to eat. Have a bite. Where are my kids? The kids aren't hungry. I treated them to McDonalds What do you want? It's disgusting to involve my family Am I disgusting? I hadn't noticed Why go to these lengths? We're playing for big stakes today Daddy! Husband! Help, Dad Kwan, let my family go! You think it's that easy... Are you carzy or a child yourself? Don't hit my dad! Kill me, but spare my family! Do you know why they have to die? This is between us. Don't harm them In September, I smuggled some goods from Thailand The police were tipped off And my men were arrested You ruined my business I lost $70 million Remember Ba-bai, my buddy? You never compensated me for his loss Bitch Beg me And maybe I'll be merciful and let you go We are of the same society Do with as me you will But harm them and my ghost will kill you! Kwan, don't... Your ghost will pursue me? Let's make sure it's weak! How can I let you go? You kicked me and you're not even dead yet Show me his hand I lost $70 million and I still give you this. Open wide How about his family? A triad must keep his word. And I said they would die No pictures! We have a right to report the news My boss died, Make trouble and I'll send you to join him Officer, they've threatened us The police are not insensitive Please let them grieve in peace Even they're more understanding! Please step forward. First bow... Second bow. Third bow. Thanks from the family My condolences Another guest arrives It's Ho Nam Why is he here? What do you want? To burn incense You aren't entitled to do so You can bow right here We are family Quiet! Don't cause trouble I'll burn incense, then leave You are no longer a member. The others won't allow it I am no longer a member. But he was my boss since I was 14 I'm here to pay my respects to him He was like a father to me I hoped you would honor that Nam is righteous He did follow Bee for years Very well! Thank you You must run the gauntlet Boss... Go ahead Go away Why are you here? I'm the head of Hung Hing. I must burn incense Everyone here can, except you! What? You're responsible... Careful what you say without evidence. Bee had many enemies Maybe he raped someone else's girl He and his men love sex crimes If you did this, you're dead! Do you think you're capable?
