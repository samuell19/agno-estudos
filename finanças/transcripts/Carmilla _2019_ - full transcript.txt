(LADYBUG RUSTLING) LARA: Stigma and style. MISS FONTAINE: Good. And why do flowers have color and smell? LARA: To make them beautiful and lovely. MISS FONTAINE: No. To attract insects. LARA: So, to be destroyed? Part of the flower has to die in order for what's left to become a new fruit. Secure? (BIRDS CHIRPING) (LARA HUMMING) Lara! (BELL RINGING) Lara! (GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC) There are still wild flowers. The almanac did predict a late autumn. It's not often wrong. Can't believe it. 68 days and now only 12 left until Charlotte arrives. Isn't it funny? It felt like such a lifetime ago and now it's nearly here. Yes, it'll be good for you to have a companion for a few months, if nothing else to stop all this incessant daydreaming. LARA: Well, I have a list of things for us to do during her stay. MISS FONTAINE: Do you? (DOOR CREAKS) - (DOOR THUDS) - I know, Miss Fontaine. MISS FONTAINE: Pick that up, please. LARA: Charlotte and I can try on each other's dresses. Lara, I know you're excited about Charlotte's visit, but your father might not appreciate such idle chatter. Where do spirits go? The good ones go up. Up to the hills? Even further. To heaven. (LARA SIGHS) Have you written Charlotte a welcome letter? You'll have time when you change for dinner. (PEN SCRATCHING) (PEN TAPPING) (PEN SCRATCHING) (BELL RINGING) (CLOCK TICKING) MR. BAUER: Thank you, Margaret. Lord, we thank you for these gifts of your bounty at our table.

(DISHWARE CLATTERING) (GENTLE MUSIC) (FOOTSTEPS TREADING) (DOOR CLACKS) (DRAWER THUDS) What's that? Nothing. (DRAWER THUDS) We talked about this, Lara. These are not images for a young lady. You have nothing to say? You took a book from your father's study without asking, kept it for who knows how long, hidden away, proving you knew it was wrong, and yet you did it anyway. (BOOK THUDS) Stand up. Palm. (RULER SLAPS) (RULER SLAPS) Look at me. (RULER SLAPS) Now, I will pray hard for you tonight, Lara. Pray hard that these images don't visit your night terrors. You're playing with fire, Lara, you and your left hand. Playing with the devil. Now, you pray hard too. Pray hard. (GENTLE MUSIC) Pray hard, Lara.

She was coming and now she's not. It's what you said. (LARA SIGHS) I called the devil. It's because of me. It's true. Shh. (LARA SOBBING) Hey. Now, now, now, now. Oh, Lara. You keep to my rules and all will be well. Hmm? All will be well. I won't let the devil into this house. Don't you worry about that. I'll always care for you, Lara. Always protect you. You're always safe with me. Do you hear? (DOOR CLACKS) (LARA SIGHS) This belonged to your mother. I thought you might like to have it. Now, the brooch and the fur must stay together.

OLD MAN: Just bad luck, I guess. PAUL: All right? She's not half rich, I can say that. OLD MAN: Wonder if there's any documents in this mess. (LARA GASPS) Expect there's a family name in there somewhere. PAUL: We'll have a look. OLD MAN: Aye. (WAGON RATTLING) (GENTLE MUSIC) (NECKLACE JINGLING) (SCISSORS CLACKING) She seems to be unscathed. Her breathing is regular. No broken bones? Doesn't appear so. What should we do now? Try not to disturb her. Cases like this, they just need time. Put water to her lips five times a day. Like this. (GIRL GASPS) Everyone stay quiet, please. I am Dr. Renquist. Can you speak? How many people can you see here in this room? She may be in shock. Don't be frightened. MISS FONTAINE: There was some commotion about the house last night. There was a carriage crash involving a young lady round about your age. She was in a desperate state when she arrived, first unconscious, then unable to speak, but Dr. Renquist believes she will be fine, God willing. She just needs rest, peace and quiet. So until we have ascertained the identity of this young lady, she will remain here as our guest. I've put her in the room at the top of the east stairs to keep her as far away as possible from any household commotion. It is imperative she not be disturbed. She's in a very sensitive state, Lara, so don't even ask if you may see her. (ANT RUSTLING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (ANTS RUSTLING) Lara! Lara. Even though there are no lines, you still must pretend there are. For example... Go on. Tell me. You've been daydreaming since our latest arrival, and while I understand your anticipation, you seem to be curious about something, so, go on, ask. Have you ever met Charlotte? I have not. Do you think the girl who crashed in the carriage is Charlotte? No, I do not. Why? Your father has met the Duval girl. He would recognize her. Why do you think it could be Charlotte? I thought a miracle happened and maybe Charlotte got better, or perhaps still ill, and she decided to sneak off and got into the carriage and set out on the road, and she pressed her carriage driver to go as fast as he could to get here by daybreak, and that's what caused the crash. Thought she was so excited and determined to stay here that that's what happened, and you and Father were hiding her from me because you knew she couldn't come, but you didn't want to disappoint me. Oh, child. That's not what happened. Your thoughts have run off with themselves. We don't know who she is, I can assure you, nor her driver, God rest his soul. Now, have you chosen a poetry piece to practice your elocution? I thought maybe a sonnet. Excellent. Nice and simple. Why don't you go to your room and begin memorizing? I have errands to run. (WIND BLOWING) (GENTLE MUSIC) Miss Fontaine? Miss Fontaine. Are you in a rush? How's the patient? DR. RENQUIST: She's perfect, except that she won't speak. You almost sound disappointed. Having seen the fate of the poor driver, I would say she's as lucky as an angel. Isn't the expression, "the luck of the devil"? She's too pretty. Tell me, why is that men are so easily swayed at the sight of a pretty face? Not I. No? No. No, I see the same devil lying in that bed as you do, Miss Fontaine. Don't be absurd. I don't see... She's just a girl, a girl like Lara. I'm teasing. Lara might have a playmate after all instead of Charlotte. And what of Charlotte? Well, there have been rumors. What rumors? Superstitions about... For that there is no medical remedy. Miss Fontaine, in these times, you would be hard-pressed to find another household taking in a stranger. (WORMS RUSTLING) (LARA BREATHING HEAVILY) (DOOR CLACKS) Lara, do... (DOOR CREAKS) (DOOR THUDS) You all right? Yes. You just startled me is all. You said your prayers? We shall say a prayer together for that poor young girl. (FIRE CRACKLING) Good. (DOOR CLACKS) (DOOR CREAKS) Good night.

It's for your safety. Lots of danger in this house, is there? (GIRL CHUCKLES) You're not from around here, are you? A girl from the town over, Charlotte Duval, she was supposed to stay with us for several months. But it seems as though she's not the only one recently. You haven't told me your name. Do you remember your name? Well, we have to call you something. Choose. I can't name you. Sure you can. I'm sure you've named things before. Fish and birds and such, but never a person. But you said it yourself, you have to call me something. Valerie? Clarissa. Carmilla. Claire. Carmilla. Carmilla. (FLOOR CREAKS) I should return to my room. Wait. You mustn't tell of this. I won't. It's our secret. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (FIRE CRACKLING) (BUTTONS SNAPPING) (LARA GRUNTING) (BLOOD SQUISHING) She speaks. MARGARET: She's speaking. She can speak. Miss Fontaine. She can speak. I'm Miss Fontaine, governess of this house, of the Bauer estate. We're here to help you, help you recover and find your family. Do you understand? How are you feeling? Do you know what happened to you? How you got here? What is your name? Shall we start there? Can you at least recall what your name is? CARMILLA: Yes. MR. BAUER: So what is it? CARMILLA: Carmilla. Well, Carmilla, do you, for instance, know where you're from, who your family is? This is all so confusing. Yes, of course. Well, you're safe and sound here. I will have some inquiries made in the area. You will stay here until we can reunite you with your family, and hopefully, over that time, your memory will return. You are most kind. Good. Do I have to stay in this room? I understand your eagerness, but you should rest. Perhaps tomorrow. No need to rush anything. You've been through so much. (GENTLE MUSIC) (FLY BUZZING) (HORSE HUFFING) Shh. (HORSE HUFFING) (FLY BUZZING) (CUP THUDS) Welcome. I gave her one of Lara's dresses to wear. Hope you don't mind, Miss Fontaine. - (FLY BUZZING) - Oh. Oh! (LARA CHUCKLES) Bring us some tea, please, Margaret. Now, Mr. Bauer is departing momentarily. He will do everything he can to find your next of kin. But we are so pleased you've made such a swift recovery. We'll have you back where you belong in no time. Won't we, Lara? May I take Carmilla outside and show her the grounds? Yes, but you must be back in time for some tea, please. (GIRLS LAUGHING) (DOOR CLACKS) (HORSE TROTTING) Miss Fontaine says at the top of those hills, there are these mounds. She calls them spirit mounds. They say it's where fallen angels go when they're expelled from heaven. They say the spirits will drive you mad and drive you to... Drive you to do what? Hurt yourself. Or worse. Did you ever touch one? Heavens, no. Miss Fontaine forbids I ever go there, or even stare too hard to the other side. She knows all sorts about such things. Does she? (CLOCK TICKING) (GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC) (GIRLS LAUGHING) (DOOR CREAKS) (LARA BREATHING HEAVILY) That dress doesn't look like that on me. (GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC) I want to show you something fun. Don't be afraid. Breathe. (LARA BREATHING HEAVILY) Breathe deeper. Deeper. Now, faster. Faster. (LARA PANTING) Hold your breath. (LARA INHALES) (DISHWARE CLATTERING) (CLOCK TICKING) (BELL RINGING) (BELL RINGING) Told you before, Lara, not to leave your trinkets about the house. And you know how I feel about that in particular. Let me see you eat something, Carmilla. You must be famished. Apart from which, Margaret went to a lot of trouble to prepare us something hot. Eat it. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Thine eyes and on thy forehead gaze. 200 to adore each breast, but 30,000 to the rest. An age at least to every part. An age at least to every part. And the last age should show your heart. And the last age should show your heart. An age at least to every part, and the last age should show your heart. (LADYBUGS RUSTLING) The grave's a fine and private place, but none, I think, do there embrace. Now therefore, while thy youthful hew sits on thy skin like morning dew, and while thy willing soul transpires at every pore with instant fires, now let us sport us while we may, and now, like amorous birds of prey, rather at once our time devour than languish in his slow-chapped power. That's very impressive. But you have missed a verse. It's all very exciting, isn't it? Come. (BOOK THUDS) Let's go for a walk. I remember when I was a young lady, about your age, there was a person who gave me a feeling I had never felt before. It was a new feeling, and it confused me. So to understand it, I reflected on it, on what that feeling could be. But before I understood it, I made choices based on it. And those choices affected the rest of my life. Looking back, I now know what that feeling was. It was excitement, that's all. But I wish I'd known that then. Don't confuse your feelings, Lara. Don't make the same mistakes I did. Don't touch it, Lara. It's just nature. LARA: Why has nothing eaten it? Dead animals are food for living ones. You taught me that. Not actually so. Living ones are more appealing. Perhaps it's diseased. If an animal eats that, it could die from the very same sickness that killed that poor thing. (INSECT BUZZING) (SNAIL SQUISHING) (INSECTS RUSTLING) (SAW WHIRRING) (BLOOD SQUISHING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC) Don't be scared. (LARA GURGLING) (LARA GASPS) (LARA PANTING) (LARA SIGHS) (FLOOR CREAKING) (THUDS LOUDLY) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Carmilla? Carmilla. Carmilla, are you all right? (LARA GASPS) I must have fallen out of bed while dreaming. I'm fine. I had quite a dream now too. In fact, you were in it. You have perfume on. Heavens, no. I sometimes rub the petal of a rose, though, and pretend. Do you like the smell? Yeah, it's pretty. Tell me about your dream. The one I was in. (LARA SIGHS) They say it's what one doesn't say in recounting a dream that has the most significance. Do you think that's the same with poems? What do you mean? I left out a verse when reciting my poem today to Miss Fontaine. Do you want to hear it? Mm-hmm. For, Lady, you deserve this state, nor would I love at lower rate. But at my back, I always hear time's winged chariot hurrying near, and yonder all before us lie deserts of vast eternity. "Deserts of vast eternity." That's truly beautiful. There was something from my dream. I couldn't breathe. In real life too. I woke and I still couldn't breathe. Couldn't breathe and I couldn't call out. It was terrifying. It felt as though there was something around my neck, as though... (GENTLE MUSIC) As though death were around your neck. Yes, as though death were around my neck. You see? You can breathe perfectly. Come. LARA: Where are you going? Come. Carmilla, no. Carmilla. (FOOTSTEPS TREADING) (DOOR THUDS) (BIRD SQUAWKING) (BIRD SQUAWKING) (WATER SPLASHES) (WATER SPLASHES) (WATER SPLASHES) You're so beautiful. Come with me. This is where I get my rose petals. Hold this. CARMILLA: Don't do that. Why not? It doesn't want to come off. That's silly. Flowers are supposed to be picked. Stop it. (CARMILLA GROANS) You see? (GENTLE MUSIC) Let's be blood sisters. You're beautiful. (CLOCK TICKING) (DISHWARE CLATTERING) (BELL RINGING) (MISS FONTAINE SIGHS) (DISHWARE CLATTERING) (KNIFE SCRAPING) (DOOR CLACKS) MISS FONTAINE: Good morning. Good morning. (TOAST CRUNCHES) Carmilla hasn't come down yet? No, she has not. (TOAST CRUNCHES) (TEA SPLASHING) Shall I go and wake her? Best to let her lie in, after all she's been through. Mm. Did you sleep well? Yes. And yet you look most tired. And pale. Are you sure you're feeling well? Well, perhaps you just need a bit of sunshine. This morning, if the weather permits, we shall go for a walk, just you and I. (TOAST CRUNCHES) Lara, I shall have to bind that arm of yours again if you're not mindful. Where is your head these days? First, you're fixated on Charlotte's visit and now... You- (BELL RINGING) (MISS FONTAINE SIGHS) (DOOR CLACKS) Madam, I bring you the latest and greatest potions and lotions, elixirs and fixers, magic and lotion. Not for the faint-hearted, mind. But if you are, I can fix that too. Hearts fixed with no tricks. (GROUP APPLAUDING) (FLAME ROARS) (GROUP APPLAUDING) (GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC) And I can take several petals, gathered from this very garden, so that each delicate fragment can become whole again.

(PENCIL SCRATCHING) (DOOR CLACKS) (DOOR CREAKS) (DOOR THUDS) What is this? It's from my mother. CARMILLA: Your mother? Yes, she passed when I was young. The brooch is nice. You know we're not true blood sisters, don't you? Yes, I know. To be true blood sisters, both our blood must mix. You have mine, but I not yours. It's your turn. I have a dark secret, you know? I'm left-handed. That's not a secret, and certainly not dark. It is. Miss Fontaine says it calls the devil.

(DOOR CLACKS) (DOOR CREAKS) (DOOR THUDS) And how many would that make? This is the third case. And now, Lara makes four? Lara's symptoms are still too early for us to make that conclusion. Well, I found this in her carriage. (DR. RENQUIST SIGHS) Have you seen any of these behaviors in the child? She sleeps excessively late. She removed a cross and hid it under her bed. We all saw how the dog reacted to the sight or perhaps even the smell of her. Trust animals to see what we can't. And... Miss Fontaine, what is it? The other day, I found them in Lara's bedroom. She had taken Lara's blood. I saw it. (DR. RENQUIST SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) DR. RENQUIST: I must go and alert Mr. Bauer. Don't leave me here. Please. (GENTLE MUSIC) (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) With all our efforts to keep this house safe, it does seem that we, or rather Mr. Bauer, has let the devil right in through the front door. Dr. Renquist will guide us in restoring things back to normal order. But we will need your full cooperation. We will need your help. - You have mine. - More than that. We will need your confidence. This cannot become gossip nor reach Mr. Bauer before time. MARGARET: You have my word, Miss Fontaine. Now, in the absence of Mr. Bauer, we cannot seek his permission. But trust this is the only way to save Lara now. (DOOR CLACKS) (CARMILLA FAINTLY SPEAKING) (DR. RENQUIST FAINTLY SPEAKING) CARMILLA: No! MISS FONTAINE: I said don't move!
