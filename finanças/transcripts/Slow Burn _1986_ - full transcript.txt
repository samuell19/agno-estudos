OF ALL THE WAYS THIS DESERT TESTS YOU, THE MOST DANGEROUS IS THE MIRAGE. IN THOSE SHIMMERING, SPARKLING DEPTHS, YOU SEE WHATEVER YOU WANT-- WATER, WEALTH, DREAMS. THAT'S THE PROMISE, AND THAT'S THE CURSE. WHEN THE SAND SWALLOWED THE WIDOW McTEAGUE, THE DESERT TURNED HER SILVER BOX INTO A MIRAGE. IN 1907, HER SECOND HUSBAND SQUANDERED HIS LAST PESOS... PURSUING WHAT HE'D ALMOST HAD. THIRTY YEARS LATER, HER GROWN CHILDREN BEGAN TO BELIEVE.... THEY SAW A WAY TO RECOVER THEIR LOST GLORY. AFTER THE WAR, ONE OF THEIR SONS IMAGINED HE SAW A WAY... TO GET BACK THE LIFE HE'D DISCARDED AT THE RECRUITING OFFICE. FINALLY, 12 YEARS AGO, HIS GRANDDAUGHTER SAW ME. HUMIDITY'S ABOUT SIX PERCENT. THAT MEANS IT TAKES A GROWN-UP FOUR QUARTS A DAY JUST TO SWEAT. IF YOU RUN DRY, YOUR BLOOD GETS THICK, YOUR TONGUE TURNS HARD, AND YOU'RE DEAD IN 19 HOURS. I'LL REMEMBER THAT. OH, SHE WAS THE LAST THING YOU'D EXPECT TO FIND OUT HERE. SHE BELONGED. HI, MOM. WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR CATALINA. - HEY, DAD. - HI. JACOB McTEAGUE. COME ON UP. FRANK NORRIS. A COUPLE OF HANDSHAKES. THE ORDINARY GREETINGS. JUST WHAT YOU'D DO WITH ANY STRANGERS. BUT OUT HERE YOU DON'T STAY STRANGERS FOR LONG. TRINA. OVER THE NEXT MONTHS, WE BECAME A FAMILY... OF SORTS. I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME. CATALINA. CATALINA. I EVEN SHARED THEIR SECRETS. - YOU SOLD THE HOUSE, DIDN'T YOU? - I SOLD THE TRAILER, YEAH, TO GET THE TRUCK SO WE DON'T GET STRANDED OUT HERE. STRANDED? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? COME ON. PIECE-- TRINA, COME HERE. THERE'S SOMETHING I WANNA SHOW YOU. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING-- WE FOUND HER WATCH, THE KEY, WE FOUND THE BIBLE. WE'RE SO CLOSE. JACOB, WE FOUND PAULINA'S WATCH TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO! DID I EVER SHOW YOU THIS? HERE. IT'S VOLCANIC. STOP IT! COME HERE. COME HERE. I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU! STOP IT! THERE ARE STEAM VENTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SALT FLATS. FIVE THOUSAND DEGREES. WHAT? I CAN'T-- I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. OH, COME ON. NO, LEAVE ME ALONE! IT TAKES THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO LAY THOSE THINGS DOWN. WE'RE GONNA FIND IT. IT'S OUT THERE. HEY, IT DOESN'T MATTER. IS IT FOR ME? YES, IT IS. I GOT SOMETHIN' ELSE FOR YOU. SOMETHIN' VERY SPECIAL. THAT'S FOR YOU. PUT IT AROUND YOUR NECK. I WON'T DISAPPOINT YOU, DADDY. I PROMISE. I KNOW YOU WON'T. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE LIGHT YOUR CAKE? I MISS MAMA. TELL ME WHAT TO DO. BUT EVEN THEN, WE ALL KNEW CATALINA WASN'T COMING BACK. THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DEGREES. THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY. - IT'S PROBABLY OVER THERE. - MAYBE. "MAYBE." IT IS! PROBABLY. SO THEY WENT ON, DAY AFTER DAY, YEAR AFTER YEAR, UNTIL THERE WAS ONLY HER... AND THE SEARCH. I'M SORRY. YOUR GEODES AREN'T BRINGIN' IN WHAT THEY USED TO. SINCE YOU PROMISED THIS'D BE YOUR LAST SEASON, THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM, RIGHT? WHAT YOU GOT PLANNED, FRANK? A SURPRISE. OH, YEAH? WHAT IS THIS? A LITTLE DUTCH COURAGE, A NICE NEW DRESS, AND THEN YOU WALK ME INTO TOWN? NO, IT'S TO CELEBRATE YOUR NEW LIFE... IN CANCUN. I KNOW THIS GUY WHO WORKS IN ONE OF THESE RESORTS THEY HAVE. THEY NEED PEOPLE WHO CAN SPEAK BOTH LANGUAGES. YOU KNOW, FIT IN WITH THE CLIENTELE. I TOLD HIM YOU'D BE JUST RIGHT FOR IT. NO. FOR YOU. - FOR PEOPLE THAT BELONG THERE. - OH, COME ON. - YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY. - WHAT ARE YOU NOW, MY DAD? NO. NO. TSK. AW, GEE. LET ME DO IT. - NO. - COME ON! YOU CAN'T DO-- I HAVE THIS DREAM, FRANK. I'M IN A GROCERY STORE. JUST A REGULAR GROCERY STORE. I WAKE UP AND MY HEART IS POUNDING, BECAUSE I DON'T BELONG THERE, AND... ANY PLACE I GO IS A FOREIGN COUNTRY. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A DANCE. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A LIBRARY. I NEVER HAD A PHONE NUMBER. I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A SWIMMING POOL. I NEVER-- NEVER-- I'M NOT GONNA WAKE UP AND SPROUT WINGS AND FLY. RIGHT? I MEAN, UM, THIS IS, UM-- THIS IS ME. THIS IS IT. UH-- I'VE GROWN UP. I MEAN, LOOK AT ME, FRANK. LOOK HARD. WHO WOULD WANT THIS? JESUS! LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE CATALINA'S LITTLE GIRL. GET YOUR MONEY BACK! AND I'M NOT GOIN' TO CANCUN EITHER. - WE HAD A DEAL. - NO DEAL! THIS DESERT KILLED FOUR GENERATIONS OF MY FAMILY! - DO YOU WANNA MAKE IT FIVE? - I WILL NOT BE THE LAST LOSER IN A CHAIN OF LOSERS! YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE I LEARNED ABOUT THIS DESERT. I RESPECT IT, AND I LISTEN TO IT. - WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO GODDAMN STUBBORN OVER THIS? - BECAUSE THIS IS ALL I GOT! WHAT IF YOU FIND PAULINA AND THE DIAMONDS AREN'T THERE? - SHUT UP! SHUT UP! - THEN WHAT ARE YOU GONNA HAVE? YOU'RE NEVER GONNA FIND THOSE DIAMONDS! OH, JESUS, I'M SORRY. NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? DON'T NEED A DADDY ANYMORE. MAYBE TOMORROW, TRACY. SOME DREAMS DIE HARD. BECAUSE IN THIS DESERT, UNDER THAT BURNING EYE, THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER DREAMER. YOU'RE THINKIN' AGAIN, AREN'T YA? YEAH. I WAS THINKIN' ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WHEN WE GET ACROSS THE BORDER. SEE? I'M IN THIS HELLHOLE, FIGHTIN' FOR OUR LIVES, YOU'RE SITTIN' IN SOME ICE CREAM PARLOR IN EL PASO WITH A BANANA IN YOUR MOUTH. COME ON. I STILL-- I STILL SAY... THAT IF WE NEVER PLAN WHERE WE WANNA GO, WE AIN'T NEVER GONNA GET THERE. WHEN ARE YOU GONNA LEARN, DUSTER? THE FUTURE AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN UNLESS YOU MAKE THE MOST OF IT RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW. IT COULD BE SO GOOD, MARCUS. YOU HIT THE JACKPOT WHEN YOU GOT CHAINED TO ME, AND WHAT DID I GET? HEY! THERE WE GO. SEE, DISCIPLINE. MENTAL TOUGHNESS. GET SOME, IF YOU WANNA BE LIKE ME. WHAT IF I DON'T WANNA BE LIKE YOU? I HEARD THAT. MARCUS, WAIT UP. YOU THINK BUGS GET ITCHY, MARCUS? BECAUSE IF THEY GET ITCHY, THEY'D ITCH ON THE INSIDE, 'CAUSE THE SKELETON'S ON THE OUTSIDE. BUGS DON'T GET ITCHY! WHY NOT? THEIR LIVES ARE TOO GODDAMN SHORT, THAT'S WHY. WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT? HOLY SHIT! CONGRATULATIONS, PAL. YOU AIN'T THE ONLY ONE OUT HERE DEAD BETWEEN THE EARS. YOU SURE KNOW HOW TO PICK AN EASY MARK. THIS SUCKER'S BEEN OUT HERE SO LONG, WE MIGHT FIND SOME ANTIQUE JEWELRY. MARCUS, I'M GONNA LEAVE THIS FOR IT, OKAY? AIN'T THAT SWEET? SENDING FLOWERS WHILE I GROPE THE STIFF. HEY, MARCUS, THESE LITTLE PICTURES ARE EVERYWHERE. - HUH? - YOU THINK THEY MEAN SOMETHIN'? WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE? RING. OH, JESUS! NA-- HEY, DUSTER, YOU REMEMBER OUR LITTLE CONVERSATION? WHICH ONE? THE ONE ABOUT ALL THE THINGS YOU MISS IF YOU AIN'T LIVIN' IN THE HERE AND NOW. AAH, FUCK YA. THE HERE AND NOW HERE OR WH-WHEN YOU WERE TALKING BEFORE? FORGET IT. I TAKE IT ALL BACK. DON'T NEED NO CHAIN, TO HAVE YOU DRAG ME DOWN. I KNEW IT THE DAY MAMA SAID, "MEET YOUR COUSIN." IN THE LOTTERY OF LIFE, HOW THE HELL DID I DRAW YOU? I DON'T KNOW WHY WE GOT WHAT WE GOT, BUT WE GAVE OURSELVES A COMBINE. AND NO MATTER WHAT, WE PUT EVERYTHING WE ARE, EVERYTHING WE GOT IN THE COMBINE, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GOTTEN US THROUGH. SOMETIMES WHAT WE SHARE IS GOOD, AND SOMETIMES IT'S BAD. BUT RIGHT NOW-- RIGHT NOW IT'S THIS, MARCUS. YOU DID IT. YOU SON OF A BITCH! WE'RE RICH! AND YOU DID IT! DUMB FUCKIN'-- I GOT THIS OFF THE STIFF. I SHOULD'VE PUT IT IN THE COMBINE, BUT I DIDN'T, SO I'M DOIN' IT NOW. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME, MARCUS. I LOVE YA. I LOVE YA. MARCUS, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T SLAM THAT BOX SHUT, BECAUSE IT'S GONNA TAKE A BLOWTORCH TO GET IT OPEN AGAIN. WHAT NOW, WITH THE ROCK COLLECTION? YEAH, YEAH, ESPECIALLY NOW, MARCUS. HELL, THEN, TAKE A BIG ONE. PAWN MY WATCH SHH, SHH, SHH! COME ON. PAWN MY CHAIN PAWN EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN MY NAME OH, LORDY ME DIDN'T I SHAKE SUGARY EVERYTHING I GOT DOWN IN PAWN EVERYTHING I GOT DOWN IN PAWN THE WIDOW'S DIAMONDS. IT WAS THE LAST THING ON EARTH I EVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. ALL I KNEW WAS THAT A COUPLE OF CONVICTS HAD ESCAPED FROM MATAMOROS. DISOWNED OR NOT, I NEEDED TO WARN TRINA, SO I WENT BACK INTO THE DESIERTO, AND I CAME ACROSS SOME TRACKS. IN THE END, I'D GUESS YOU'D JUST CALL THAT GOOD LUCK. I BROUGHT YOU A SURPRISE. I'M READY TO LIVE AGAIN. GO GET THE TRUCK. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? I FOLLOWED THEIR TRACKS, BUT I LOST THEM WHERE THEY MET A SET OF TIRE TRACKS. HEY! SORRY TO BOTHER YA. WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT? OUR TRUCK WIPED OUT. WE WERE HOPIN' YOU COULD GIVE US A RIDE... EL NORTE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE? W-W-WE COULD PAY YOU. I'M NOT SOME TAXI. W-WE'RE JUST OUT HERE COLLECTING ROCKS. WE MUST HAVE TOOK A WRONG TURN SOMEWHERE. WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO TEXAS. WHERE YOU GOIN'? GET IN. COME ON, MARCUS. THE BACK. WE'VE GOT TO STOCK UP ON WATER. GABBY'S TANK'S UP THERE WHERE THOSE THREE ROCKS ARE. YOU'VE GOTTA BE SHITTIN' ME. I MEAN, WHAT-- YOU GOTTA TAKE ALL THAT STUFF OUT OF THE TRUCK NOW? I'M NOT RIGGED FOR PASSENGERS. THERE'S NOTHING OUT HERE BUT A THOUSAND DEAD ENDS. YOU KNOW, I'LL BET WE COULD HIRE A LAWYER, SORT OUT THE PAST, ALL THE BAD THINGS WE EVER DONE. YOU GOT THAT RIGHT. I'D LIKE TO GET A HOUSE TOO. DEFINITELY A HOUSE. WITH A YARD SO I CAN HAVE A BIG DOG. HELL, YOU CAN GET THREE OF 'EM. WE NEED NEW CLOTHES TOO. DEFINITELY NEW DUDS. - NOTHIN' WITH STRIPES ON 'EM, RIGHT, MARCUS? - NOTHIN' BUT GIORGIO ARMANI. LOOK AT THAT. A LIFETIME IN THE MAKIN'. SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THE BIG SCORE, MARCUS? ME? AH, WELL-- WHAT? I NEVER, UH-- - SHIT! - YES-- WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP IT? WHA-- GO GET THE BOX. - NOW, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET OUT OF HERE ALIVE? - SETTLE DOWN, ALL RIGHT? DUSTER, COME ON. CHOP-CHOP. GIVE ME THE BOX. COULD YOU HELP ME, PLEASE? KEEP PUSHING. I'M GONNA GO TRY AND BOUNCE IT OFF. KEEP PUSHING! READY? ONE, TWO, THREE. DUSTER, YOU KNOW WHAT AN INTELLIGENT MAN WOULD DO IN THIS SITUATION? SIT AND WATCH. A REAL INTELLIGENT MAN WOULD PUT HIS BACK INTO IT, MARCUS. ALL RIGHT. WATCH IT! WATCH IT! YOU ALL RIGHT? WHERE'S THE BOX? WHERE'S THE BOX? YOU WERE HOLDIN' IT! WHERE'S THE FUCKIN' BOX? I FOUND IT. IT'S RIGHT HERE. HEY, IS THIS THING IMPORTANT? WHAT IS IT? THIS THING BETTER NOT PUT ANY KINKS IN MY PLANS. WHAT PLANS, MARCUS? I DON'T WANT MY FUTURE SLIPPIN' AWAY BEFORE I FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS. THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL GET. BOOZE IS JUST THE FIRST STEP. I KNOW THE REST OF THE 12 STEPS. I'M GONNA USE THAT BOOZE TO START A LITTLE BUSINESS. I GET MYSELF A HOUSE, A YARD, A DOG. THAT'S MY FUTURE. THERE IS NO FUTURE! WE DON'T HAVE ANY WAY TO FIX THE TRUCK, AND YOU CAN'T WALK OUT OF HERE. IN FOUR DAYS THAT WATER WILL BE GONE, AND THEN YOU AND ME ARE GONNA BE DEAD. ISN'T THIS FUNNY, MARCUS? YEAH. FUNNY IF IT'S HAPPENIN' TO SOMEONE ELSE. I-I-IN THE FUTURE THEY'LL BUY US STEAK DINNERS, LIMOUSINES. BUT THE HERE AND NOW, OUR BIG SCORE IS WORTHLESS. THEY CAN'T EVEN BUY US 12 HOURS OF WATER. HEY, YOU GOT ANYTHING USEFUL IN THAT SADDLEBAG? UH, YEAH, YEAH, WE GOT LOTS OF THINGS. WE GOT-- WE GOT SOME CLOTHES AND SOME TORTILLAS, A COUPLE PIECES OF HACKSAW AND MY-- MY COLLECTION. WHAT COLLECTION? HIS ROCK COLLECTION. YOU'RE CARRYING ROCKS ACROSS THE DESERT? NO. I-I-I MEAN, YEAH. HE'S BEEN COLLECTIN' SINCE HE WAS A KID. I MEAN, THEY'RE NOTHIN' SPECIAL, BUT THERE'S A COUPLE IN HERE THAT ARE KIND OF NICE. I LIKE THIS ONE A LOT. THAT ONE'S NICE. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS? WHAT? YOU JUST SAVED OUR LIVES. THIS IS PUMICE. THAT'S TUFA. WE MIX IT TOGETHER WITH A LITTLE SAND AND SOME MOTOR OIL. IT COULD MAKE A FORGE. COULD FIX THE LINKAGE. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT? NOTHIN'. ROCKS. AT SUNSET, I STOPPED SEARCHING, AND I TOOK CATALINA BACK, BACK TO THE PLACE I'D FOUND THE WIDOW McTEAGUE ALL THOSE YEARS AGO. NOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW CATALINA DIED, BUT I WAS THE ONE WHO GAVE HER THE DIAMONDS. THE LEAST I COULD DO WAS GIVE MY OLD FLAME A DECENT BURIAL. YOU DIED FOR A BUNCH OF ROCKS, CAT. A BUNCH OF GODDAMN ROCKS. I GOT THE TRUCK. TRINA'S NOT... COMING WITH US. AND NEITHER ARE YOU. WAIT, WAIT. WHAT'D I DO WRONG? - YOU LISTENED TO ME. - WAIT! I'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO CATALINA... IN THOSE FEW MINUTES IT TOOK ME TO GET MY TRUCK. THE ONE THING I DO KNOW, IS THAT TRINA WAS NEVER QUITE THE SAME... AFTER THAT NIGHT HER MOTHER LEFT. I WAS SEARCHING FOR TRINA AT FIRST LIGHT. I KNEW IT MIGHT BE DAYS BEFORE I FOUND HER. BUT, IN TRUTH, I WAS LESS WORRIED ABOUT THE CONVICTS THAN TRINA. I DON'T CARE HOW WELL YOU KNOW THE DESERT. IF YOU'RE THIRSTY ENOUGH, YOU START STUMBLING TO THE MIRAGE. WHEN WE GET THE FORGE BUILT, EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE. SO STOP RIDIN' ME. AH, MR. INDEPENDENCE. WHERE THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE WITHOUT ME TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO? I WOULDN'T BE BUSTIN' OUT OF SOME JAIL. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT, 'CAUSE YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE SHOT THE GUARD. THAT'S IT. PERFECT. HEARING YOU'RE GONNA DIE SHOULD HAVE GOT YOUR ATTENTION. THIS PLACE TESTS YOU. YEAH? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK IT EVEN CARES? THINK WHAT YOU LIKE, BUT IT WATCHES, AND IT'S IN CHARGE. YEAH? SO, TRINA, I WAS THINKIN'. SHOULDN'T WE TOP OFF THE JERRICAN AT THE WATER HOLE... SO WE DON'T LOSE SO MUCH TO EVAPORATION? YEAH. I'M A QUICK STUDY. WHY DON'T YOU STACK THOSE ROCKS IN THE FORGE? TRINA AND I ARE GONNA TANK UP. COME ON, TRINA. I'VE BEEN THINKIN' ABOUT WHAT THE HELL I'M GONNA DO ONCE I'M BACK IN THE STATES. IN CASE YOU'RE BLIND AND DIDN'T NOTICE, MY LIFE TOOK SORT OF A WRONG TURN SOMEWHERES BACK. YOU MEAN GETTING ARRESTED? HELL, I MEAN BREAKING THE LAW. THE ONLY REASON WE GOT BUSTED DOWN HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE... WAS 'CAUSE DUSTER WAS ALREADY WANTED NORTH OF THE BORDER. HAD IT ALL WORKED OUT, HAPPY AS A CLAM. HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW? I'M LYIN' THERE, TAKIN' A NICE SNOOZE ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS. COMIN' RIGHT AT ME, FULL STEAM AHEAD, A FREIGHT TRAIN NAMED DUSTER. FIRST HIS PARENTS GET WIPED OUT BY SOME DRUNK, AND MAMA'S NEXT OF KIN. A COUPLE YEARS LATER, I'M LA OF KIN. IT TOOK ME A WHILE, BUT YOU START TO SEE YOU CAN'T RISE TO THE TOP... WITH AN ANCHOR TIED AROUND YOUR NECK, YOU KNOW? - DUSTER SEEMS HARMLESS ENOUGH. - DUSTER? DUSTER'S MY COUSIN, SO I DON'T WANNA SAY NOTHIN' BAD ABOUT HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO TO GET 25 YEARS LABOR IN A MEXICAN PRISON? DON'T GIVE 'EM THE CHANCE TO SHOW YA. OH, NO, NO. YOU CAN'T GO NOWHERE. YOU CAN'T GO NOWHERE. YOU GOTTA STAY RIGHT HERE. SHH, TRACY. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. I'M GONNA FIX YOUR DOOR FOR YA. HEY! DON'T! DON'T TOUCH HER! BUT THE DOOR WAS OPEN. WELL, I-I-I CAN FIX IT SO SHE CAN LIVE IN THERE. HOLD ON, HOLD ON. I GOT IT. HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. YEP, SHE'LL BE COMFY AS A KITTEN IN HERE, TRINA. SEE, I'M A LOCKSMITH. - YOU AIN'T NO LOCKSMITH. - I WAS BEFORE, AND I TRAINED FOR A LONG TIME. AND WHO SACRIFICED HIS HARD-EARNED CASH TO GIVE YOU THAT TRAINING? - PLEASE, STOP WASTING EVERYBODY'S TIME. - SEE, I CAN DO IT. - I CAN FIX IT IF YOU WANT ME TO. - WE'LL JUST OPEN THIS UP, AND-- I WAS GONNA PUT A PIECE OF WIRE ON IT. THERE WE GO! AND WE GOT IT RIGHT HERE. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT? I'M LOOKIN' AT NOTHIN', MARCUS. THERE YOU ARE. A LITTLE DRINK. NOW, I-I-I KNOW WHAT MARCUS MUST'VE TOLD YA, AND I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON'T WANNA BE AROUND ME. BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW SOMETHIN'. I-I'D NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT THAT BIRD OF YOURS. I WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT. I JUST REALLY WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT. HEY, YOU KNOW THESE LITTLE PICTURES ON THE ROCKS HERE? YEAH? ARE-- ARE THEY LIKE A LANGUAGE OR SOMETHIN'? LIKE THIS BIRD HERE. DOES THAT MEAN SOMETHIN'? IT'S NOT A BIRD. IT'S A DRAGONFLY. OH, IT'S A DRAGONFLY. DRAGONFLIES NEED WATER TO BREED. WHEN YOU SEE ONE ON A ROCK, IN THE DIRECTION THAT IT'S POINTING, IT MEANS THERE'S WATER THERE. - I KNEW IT MEANT SOMETHIN'. I KNEW IT. THE INDIANS USED TO LEAVE 'EM FOR EACH OTHER. JUST HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF PEOPLE LEAVING THEIR MARK. SUN. SNAKE. CORN, COUNTING. MAN. WOMAN. - WELL, THEY'RE REAL BEAUTIFUL. NOW, I BET YOU CAN READ ALL THESE ROCKS AROUND HERE, HUH? CAN READ THE CHATTER. THE BIG GUYS THERE, MOST OF THE TIME THEY KEEP TO THEMSELVES. THEY'RE CALLED PETROGLYPHS. "GLYPH'S" A CARVING, AND "PETRO" MEANS STONE. HEY-- HEY, MARCUS! - WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE? - YOU KNOW ALL THESE STONE PICTURES? BUG-EYED, STARIN' THINGS? THEY'RE MESSAGES. YOU CAN READ 'EM. EACH ONE MEANS SOMETHIN' DIFFERENT. WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO READ THE MEANING ON THAT ONE, DUSTER? - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - IT'S JUST GRAFFITI, TRINA. - IT'S NOT GRAFFITI. THESE ARE SACRED CARVINGS. - SACRED TO WHO? THEY'RE SACRED TO ME! IT'S THE GRAN DESIERTO! YOU RESPECT IT, OR IT WILL KILL YOU! IT AIN'T GONNA KILL ME, 'CAUSE I'M GETTIN' OUT OF HERE IN THAT VEHICLE! SO WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED TEACHING ART APPRECIATION TO PICASSO HERE, FIX THE GODDAMN TRUCK! WHAT'S UP WITH YOU? HE'S MY PARTNER. PARTNER. IT'S GONNA BE HOT WORK. KEEP GOING. YOU WANT IT TO MELT OR WHAT? DO I GOTTA DO THIS ALONE OR WHAT? I NEED IT HOTTER. HOTTER! YOU'RE LOOKING KIND OF PEAKED, DUSTER. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BREAK? I DON'T-- I DON'T NEED A BREAK. YEAH? HE CAN'T KEEP UP. HE'S DOWN. YOU ALL RIGHT? COME ON, PAL. HE'S ALL RIGHT. HE'S GOT HEATSTROKE. NO, WE'VE GOT TO GET HIM TO THE WATER HOLE. COME ON, HELP ME! WOMEN OF QUALITY DON'T USUALLY OCCUPY THEMSELVES WITH HEATSTROKE AND HAMMERS. YOU LEARN FAST WHEN YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. THAT'S MY POINT EXACTLY. IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT WE DEPEND ON. YOUR FRIEND'S GONNA DIE IF WE DON'T GET HIS BODY HEAT DOWN. YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT HIM, DO YOU? OF COURSE I DO. THE WAY I SEE IT, IT'S PRETTY MUCH OUT OF OUR HANDS. IF HE DIES, YOU CAN'T TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA BE HEARTBROKEN. WHAT? YOU GOT CLASS. MAMA LEARNED ME HOW TO SPOT IT. THAT AIN'T EASY WHEN YOU'RE GROWIN' UP IN A CATHOUSE. I LEARNED ALL KINDS OF WOMEN. TRASH, HARD-LUCK GIRLS, YOU NAME IT. I KNOW I AIN'T GOT ANY CLASS, BUT GOD, DO I KNOW THE TASTE. WHEN THE DOOR IS CLOSED, YOU LOOK IN THE CLIENT'S WALLETS... AT THE PICTURES-- KIDS, HOUSES, WIVES. THAT'S HOW I GOT TO KNOW CLASS. THAT'S WHY I KNOW YOU. YOU DON'T KNOW A GODDAMN THING ABOUT ME! I KNOW WHATEVER HAPPENS TO DUSTER, IT'S NOT GONNA STOP YOU ANYMORE THAN IT'S GONNA STOP ME. 'CAUSE I KNOW SOMETHIN' ELSE-- YOU DON'T LET NOTHIN' GET IN YOUR WAY. YOU'RE A SON OF A BITCH, JUST LIKE ME. I AM NOTHING LIKE YOU! I'M A SLEAZY, GREEDY ROACH WHO DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN... ABOUT THE ONE PERSON WHO GIVES A DAMN ABOUT HIM? FUCK YOU! YOU'RE TRASH! PRETTY SOON, YOU GRUBBY LITTLE DESERT RAT, WE'RE GONNA GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS, AND YOU'RE NEVER GONNA KNOW WHAT KIND OF PEARLS YOU JUST THREW OUT WITH THE TRASH. WAIT. DO-- YOU ALL RIGHT? I DON'T FEEL GOOD. HUH? MY HEAD HURTS. YOU'RE PRETTY FEVERISH. DUSTER, REMEMBER ANYTHING? I REMEMBER THE FORGE. I REMEMBER YOU. I REMEMBER THE HEAT. I REMEMBER LOTS OF HEAT. - COME ON, DRINK THIS. - NO, I DON'T WANT YOUR RATION. THAT'S YOURS. YOU HAVE HEATSTROKE. YOU NEED WATER. NO. COME ON. DID WE FIX THE LINKAGE? IT'S NOTHING A BIGGER HAMMER WON'T FIX. PLEASE, DRINK THIS. MMM. I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA LEAVE ME WITH MARCUS. MARCUS DON'T MEAN TO DO THOSE BAD THINGS. MARCUS HAD A REAL TOUGH TIME GROWIN' UP. - AND YOU DIDN'T? - YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. MARCUS DONE EXTRA WORK FOR ME. SOMEONE LIKE ME COULD HAVE OPPORTUNITIES. I LEARNED ABOUT RADIAL PIN KEYS... AND MULTIPASS COMBINATION MECHANISMS. HE PAID FOR ALL THOSE COURSES. ADVANCED LOCKSMITHING. - WHY'D YOU STOP? - LOCKSMITHING'S A SPECIAL JOB. I MEAN, I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR PEOPLE'S HOMES, VALUABLES. IT TAKES A SPECIAL PERSON, THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE. AND I AIN'T THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE ANYMORE. OH, DUSTER. WHY WERE YOU IN A MEXICAN JAIL? HE AND I ROBBED A BANK. ADVANCED LOCKSMITHING. YOU SHOULDN'T LET PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU. YEAH. MAYBE ALL THAT TIME YOU WERE BUSY CRACKING SAFES, IT WAS YOU WHO WAS BEING ROBBED. ONE DREAM DOESN'T MAKE A WHOLE LIFE. TRINA. IT'S-- IT'S NOTHIN' SPECIAL, BUT-- I CAN'T TAKE THAT. OKAY. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S JUST BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE ANYONE WAS GLAD I WAS AROUND. BE CAREFUL, DUSTER. IT'S FUNNY HOW YOU NEVER TURN INTO FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE WHEN I'M AROUND. YOU SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF SPARE TIME... FOR SOMEONE WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE TRYIN' TO GET US OUT OF HERE, HUH? IF YOU'RE THAT BORED, DARLIN'-- I SAID I'D WORK ON THE LINKAGE. SO, UH, IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. JESUS CHRIST! HOW COULD YOU LET HER PUT THAT THING ON ME? - YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE BUGS! - WITHOUT INSECTS, HUMAN LIFE WOULD END IN TWO MONTHS. I DO NOT WANNA TALK ABOUT BUGS! AW, JESUS! YUCK! DID I... SEE THAT... RING ON HER HAND? IT WAS IN THE COMBINE. IT WAS WORTH SOMETHIN'. WELL, IF YOU HAD PLANS, MARCUS, YOU SHOULD'VE SAID SO. WELL, IT'S A LITTLE LATE NOW, ISN'T IT? MARCUS. MARCUS. MARCUS! SHUT YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! I DON'T WANNA HEAR ANY MORE OF YOUR GODDAMN LIP! WHERE THE FUCK DID SHE GO? YOU LEAVE HER ALONE. I'LL GIVE YOU MY HALF OF THE DIAMONDS, OKAY? IT'S WHAT YOU WANT, AIN'T IT? UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN, THEY'RE COMMON PROPERTY. THEY'RE IN THE COMBINE. I'LL GIVE 'EM TO YOU. I'LL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING. I'LL GIVE YOU THE WHOLE COMBINE. WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT. - WHAT YOU'RE SAYIN' IS, WE DON'T NEED A COMBINE ANYMORE? - NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT. - THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID! - I DID NOT-- YOU'RE ALWAYS BABBLING ABOUT HOW WE'VE GOT TO GET SOME FUTURE. WELL, WE JUST FOUND IT! I'VE BEEN MOTHERIN' YOU SINCE I WAS 16. IT'S BEEN CRUEL AND UNUSUAL. YOU WANT A FUTURE, I'LL GIVE YOU A FUTURE, ALL RIGHT? THE FUTURE I WANT IS THE ONE WITHOUT YOU. WE'LL STILL BE PARTNERS? NOT NO MORE. COME ON! DON'T GO WEAK ON ME, BOY. HIT IT HARDER. GODDAMN IT, GET IT OPEN! I WANT MY SHARE OF THEM DIAMONDS NOW! DAMN IT. - GODDAMN IT! - YOU CAN'T SHOOT IT OPEN. YOU CAN'T HIT IT OPEN. YOU CAN'T GET IT OPEN. THEN MAKE A KEY AND GET IT OPEN, ALL RIGHT? THAT'S GONNA TAKE TIME, MARCUS. HERE WE GO. I'LL MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT DISTURBED, ALL RIGHT? ANY QUESTIONS, PARTNER? NOT NO MORE, MARCUS! HEY. I THOUGHT I HEARD A CAR... BACKFIRE OR SOMETHIN'. I DIDN'T HEAR NOTHIN'. BRING THAT KEY WITH YOU. COME ON. A TOUR BUS FULL OF LAP DANCERS ON THEIR WAY TO VEGAS. ABSOLUTELY NOTHIN' THAT COMPARES TO WHAT WE GOT HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT YOU FIXING THE LATCH. IF YOUR OFFER'S STILL GOOD. Y-YEAH, THE OFFER'S ALWAYS OPEN. YOU ALREADY GOT A HOBBY, DUSTER. HERE, I'LL POLISH IT UP SO IT'LL LOOK JUST LIKE NEW, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. - YOU REALLY GONNA WORK ON PRINCESS' CAGE? - YES, I AM. HEY. LET'S TEST THE ENGINE. YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. IF WE CAN'T CRANK IT OVER, WE AIN'T GOING NOWHERE. - IT'S OUT OF GEAR, RIGHT? - I CAN'T GET IT IN GEAR. BUT IF YOU GET IT STARTED, I'M SURE I'LL BE ABLE TO FIND ONE. WHAT ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT? OH, FUCK ME! TAKE OVER FROM DUSTER. ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT. COME HERE. CAN YOU KEEP THE REVS UP? GIVE ME SOME SLACK, WILL YOU? TRUCK WILL BE READY TOMORROW. WE CAN LEAVE TOMORROW. WE CAN LEAVE TOMORROW. WH-WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? THAT WE TAKE THE TRUCK AND JUST LEAVE MARCUS HERE? HEY! WELL, WHEN YOU PASSED OUT, HE WANTED TO LEAVE YOU LYING LIKE ROADKILL. HE DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT YOU. I KNOW MARCUS. YOU DON'T KNOW ME. HEY! NOW, I GREW UP OUT HERE. HEY! AND MY FAMILY, WELL, THEY HAD SOME BAD BREAKS WAY BACK. AND NOW IT'S JUST ME. I GOT NO ONE, AND I GOT NOTHING, EXCEPT THIS DESERT AND A FEW HEIRLOOMS. DUSTER. DUSTER. DON'T YOU KNOW I WANNA GO WITH YOU? I MEAN, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, JUST DITCH MARCUS? WELL, NO. WE'LL RADIO THE FEDERALES. WE COULD HIRE SOMEONE TO COME PICK HIM UP. IT'S STILL GONNA BE ROUGH FOR HIM. NOW, ALL HE'S EVER HAD IS COMBINE AND ME. HEY, DUSTER! IF I LEAVE THE COMBINE, HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. WHA-- NO. - OH, CHRIST. - I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. NOT ANY MONEY. NOTHING. IT DON'T MATTER. NO, BECAUSE MARCUS AND I, WE BEEN-- WE BEEN UP, AND WE BEEN DOWN AND OUT. I KNOW YOU THINK YOU DON'T HAVE NOTHING, BUT YOU HAVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE. NOBODY-- NOBODY IS GONNA MAKE ME DO WHAT I KNOW IS WRONG! HEY! NOT YOU, NOT MARCUS, NOBODY! EVER AGAIN. AW, SHIT! WHAT'S EATIN' HER? I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD GET A LOT OF MAGNETIC INTERFERENCES OUT HERE. YEP. MUST PLAY HELL WITH THE COMPASSES. I'M SURPRISED YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE HALF THE TIME. WHAT, DO YOU KEEP THEM ALL ADJUSTED OR WHAT? MOST OF THEM. - RIGHT. WE'RE IN GEAR, RIGHT? - YUP. IT'S OUR ONE SLOW GEAR. BUT IT'LL RUN, RIGHT? I MEAN, WE CAN GET THE HELL OUT IN THE MORNING? SURE. A WHOPPING FIVE MILES AN HOUR. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT, MARCUS? NOTHIN'. I'VE BEEN SEARCHING WATER HOLE AFTER WATER HOLE ALL DAY, BUT IT WAS THE DARKNESS THAT LET ME FIND THEM. HEY, DUSTER, WAKE UP. COME ON. GET UP. WE'RE BACK ON THE JOB. COME ON. LET'S GO. LISTEN. HEY, LISTEN. THAT THING I SAID ABOUT US NOT BEING PARTNERS. I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE. HEY, AND JUST TO PROVE I TRUST YOU. ALL RIGHT? NOW, COME ON. SHAKE IT. LET'S GO. WE'RE GONNA SWIPE THE TRUCK, ALL RIGHT? I GOT MAPS, A COMPASS. GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT. I AIN'T GONNA DO THAT, MARCUS. I EVEN GUESSED YOU MIGHT SAY THAT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE. I GOT ALL THE ANGLES, ALL RIGHT? NOW, YOU ARE GOING TO HOT-WIRE THE TRUCK. I'M DRIVING YOU, ME AND THEM DIAMONDS OUT OF THIS DESERT. WE'RE GONNA GET THINGS BACK THE WAY THEY USED TO BE. IT AIN'T GONNA BE THE SAME, MARCUS. IT AIN'T GONNA BE LIKE IT USED TO BE. IT AIN'T. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. FINE. IT'LL BE A NEW WAY. MOVE IT! YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO YOUR BULLSHIT MY WHOLE LIFE. WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA SHOOT ME? - IF YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME, GO AHEAD AND DO IT. YOU SON OF A BITCH. I HATE YA. I HATE YA. I'VE HATED YOU SINCE THE FIRST DAY I EVER LAID EYES ON YOU. SHE DID THIS. NO, MARCUS, NO! STOP! MARCUS, COME BACK HERE! COME ON, TRINA. COME ON. - MARCUS! MARCUS! - FRANK! MARCUS, DON'T YOU TOUCH HER! MARCUS, DON'T-- MARCUS, PLEASE! GET AWAY FROM HER, MARCUS! GOD, HOW DID YOU FIND ME? 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN LOOKING, THAT'S WHY. I READ ABOUT THESE TWO CONVICTS. THEY GOT THE DIAMONDS. JESUS, TRINA, IT DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT THAT NOW. COME ON. THE TRUCK'S NOT THAT FAR. THEY'VE GOT MY DIAMONDS! DO YOU WANT TO DIE FOR THOSE DIAMONDS? DO YOU WANT TO KILL FOR THEM? THEY'VE JUST BROUGHT MISERY TO EVERYONE WHO'S EVER TOUCHED THEM. JUST LOOK WHAT THOSE DIAMONDS HAVE DONE TO YOU. CAN'T YOU SEE? ALL I WANT IS YOUR HAPPINESS. HAVEN'T YOU DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE? SOME DREAMS WON'T DIE. THEY HAVE TO BE KILLED. OH, GOD! - DID YOU SEE MARCUS? - WELL, LOOK AT HERE. AIN'T THIS CUTE? NO, MARCUS. NO. WHO THE FUCK IS THAT? OH, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? WE GOTTA GET TO THE TRUCK! - YOU GOTTA HELP ME START THE TRUCK. - WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? COME ON! WE GOTTA GET TO THE TRUCK! TRACY. THIS IS WHAT IT IS TO LIVE WITH THESE THINGS. YOU SHOOT A MAN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW... AND COUNT IT AS GOOD LUCK BECAUSE HE WAS CARRYING THEM. BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO WAS HOLDING THEM NOW. ME. HIM. THIS DESERT. THE CURSE OF THESE DIAMONDS IS THAT THEY EXIST. AS LONG AS THEY EXIST, YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE WITHIN REACH. WHERE WE HEADED? GET SOME ICE CREAM. I NEVER WANTED HIM AROUND, BUT THEN I GOT KIND OF USED TO HIM. HE WAS-- IT'S LIKE-- LIKE YOU WERE MARRIED. WHAT? THAT'S WHY I NEVER HAD A LIFE. MARRIED TO DUSTER BEFORE I EVEN GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. MUST HAVE REALLY BROUGHT YOU DOWN. I KNOW I, UH, DONE SOME BAD THINGS. WE GOT OFF TO KIND OF A ROCKY START. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? GO ON. NO, I'M-- I'M JUST SAYING MAYBE, UH-- I WANT TO FORGET THE PAST. I'M SAYING-- I'M SAYING, YOU KNOW, MAYBE-- WHAT I REALLY WANT IS A FRIEND. BUT NOT SOMEONE-- WELL, NOT SOMEONE LIKE DUSTER, BUT... SOMEONE WITH STYLE AND CLASS. A WOMAN. NOT LIKE THOSE OTHER TYPES. I LEARNED SOMETHING OUT HERE IN THE PAST FEW DAYS. YOU GOTTA GIVE TO GET. I WANNA-- I'M GONNA-- I MEAN, I WANNA-- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, HALF OF SOMETHING THAT'S-- STILL, HALF'S THE BEST THING... PROBABLY ANYONE HAS EVER GIVEN YOU. BUT BEFORE I DO, I JUST-- I FEEL LIKE I WANT-- I REALLY WANT THAT YOU SHOULD... SHAKE MY HAND. THERE'S A GUN IN YOUR HAND, MARCUS. WHAT? WHAT THE HELL, RIGHT? GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? ANYWAY, I-- SEE THIS? SEE THIS? YOUR DIAMONDS BELONGED TO MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER. BUT I WANTED TO SHARE. NO DEAL! OH, JESUS. MARCUS! OH, NO. OH, NO. NO. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. IT'S PRETTY BAD. HOLD ON. STOP THE BLEEDING, AND IT'LL BE FINE. COME HERE. HOLD ON. HOLD-- HOLD TIGHT. HOLD ON. COME ON. HOLD ON. HOLD ON TIGHT NOW. OH, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO. EVENTUALLY I KNEW TRINA WOULD DOUBLE BACK... AND LOOK AT THE GUY I SHOT. THEN SHE'LL KNOW I TOOK THE DIAMONDS, AND SHE'LL COME AFTER ME. AS SHE MUST. MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE... I COULD HAVE CONVERTED THEM INTO CASH, FOUND A CHARITY, WASHED MY HANDS. BUT, UH, THAT WAS BEFORE THIS DESERT REMINDED ME... THAT PENITENTS TYPICALLY TRAVEL ON FOOT. AND SO I HAVE. THE ONE PLACE I CAN END THIS CURSE AND PAY FOR MY CRIMES. THE DESERT WILL SWALLOW THESE DIAMONDS AGAIN. FOREVER. AND THIS TIME, EVEN SHE WILL KNOW THAT THEY ARE GONE FOR GOOD. AND SHE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DRIVE OUT OF THIS DESERT. AND THESE GHOSTS WILL FINALLY BE LAID TO REST. DUSTER. I THOUGHT YOU-- NO, THE BULLET JUST GRAZED MY HEAD AND KNOCKED ME OUT. I'M SORRY. WELL, HE HAD IT COMING. HE WAS GOING TO STRAND YOU OUT HERE, TAKE YOUR TRUCK AND LEAVE YOU TO DIE. AND I WAS GONNA LET HIM TRY. AND THEN HE WAS PUMPING YOU ABOUT MAPS AND COMPASSES. AND I FINISHED THE NEW KEY, AND I TRADED MY ROCKS FOR YOUR DIAMONDS. ALL THE PIECES WERE THERE. I PUT THEM TOGETHER. A PROSPECTOR WITH NO PROSPECTING GEAR. AND THAT KEY YOU WERE WEARING LOOKED LIKE AN ORIGINAL TO ME. THE THING IS, I DON'T HAVE YOUR DIAMONDS ANYMORE. WHAT? NO, I HAD 'EM. I HAD 'EM. THAT GUY WAS GONE WHEN I CAME TO. FRANK HAS THEM? I FOUND HIS TRUCK. AND BELIEVE ME, I SEARCHED THROUGH IT. BUT THERE'S A HOLE IN THE RADIATOR. HE MUST HAVE SET OUT ON FOOT. YOU KNOW, HE COULD HAVE GONE IN ANY DIRECTION. NO, NO, HE COULDN'T. NO, HE'S-- HE'S GOT TO CROSS THE FLATS FIRST. NO, TEXAS IS STILL A LONG WAY, AND THIS THING'S JUST PATCHED UP. NO, WE-- WE JUST TAKE HIS TRUCK. COME ON. COME ON. WE CAN GET HIM. TRINA, MAYBE IT'S BETTER THIS WAY. HELP ME START THE TRUCK. MAYBE IT'S BETTER THIS WAY. LOOK AT WHAT THE DIAMONDS DID TO MARCUS... AND WHAT THEY DID TO THE WOMAN WHO HAD THEM FIRST. WELL, THAT WOMAN WAS MY GRANDMOTHER, AND SHE LOST THEM. LOOK AT WHAT THEY DID TO HER. SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. LOOK AT WHAT THEY DID TO HER! I SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE HERE. EVERY YEAR. EVERY DAY. PLEASE. YOU WANNA KNOW WHY I GAVE UP MY ROCK COLLECTION? YOU TRADED IT FOR MY DIAMONDS. I'D RATHER HAVE MY ROCKS THAN YOURS. THE FIRST TIME I EVER PICKED ONE UP WAS FOR MY PARENTS' FUNERAL. AND THE SECOND WAS THE DAY I MOVED IN WITH MARCUS. I HAD 38 OF THEM. THE DAY I GOT MY LOCKSMITH'S LICENSE, THE DAY I WENT TO PRISON, THE FIRST DAY OF FREEDOM. SOME ARE GOOD AND SOME ARE BAD, BUT WHEN YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER, IT'S A WHOLE LIFE RIGHT THERE. YEAH? WELL, I THREW YOUR ROCKS AWAY. I-I GUESS THAT JUST MAKES US EVEN. BESIDES, I KEPT THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE-- THE DAY YOU KISSED ME. ALL'S I NEED IS ONE MORE, AND I CAN START A NEW COLLECTION. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! TRINA, THIS AIN'T ABOUT THE DIAMONDS. YOUR DREAMIN' AND THE DIAMONDS, THEY AIN'T THE SAME THING. YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THESE STONES FOR SO LONG... THAT YOU FORGOT WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU DON'T GOTTA BE LIKE THAT NO MORE. I MEAN, IT'S SIMPLE. ALL'S YOU GOTTA DO IS JUST WALK OUT OF THIS PLACE. YOU GOTTA MAKE A CHOICE. YOU JUST GOTTA MAKE A CHOICE. NO, WAIT! LOOK. ALL OF THIS IS GONNA BE THE PAST. IT'S ALL GONNA BE THE PAST. OH. ALL RIGHT. JUST SIT BACK, TRINA. WE'LL BE AT FRANK'S TRUCK SOON. I'M READY TO LIVE AGAIN. GO GET THE TRUCK. BABY, I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAD-- HOW COULD YOU? I HAVE TO GET THE DIAMONDS. I KNOW I CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT THEM. MAYBE THEY AIN'T EVEN GOOD FOR ME. I CAN'T JUST GIVE UP. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE UP? IT'LL ALL HAVE BEEN FOR NOTHING. FOR MY FATHER, FOR HIS FATHER, FOR MY GREAT-GRANDPARENTS AND FOR ME. AND NOW IT'S ALL DOWN TO ME, AND I AM GOOD ENOUGH. I AM THE ONE. HOW CAN I START A NEW LIFE WHEN I AIN'T EVEN FINISHED THE OLD ONE? WHAT IF I DON'T GO WITH YOU? YOU CAN'T GO WITH ME. YOU SHOULD TAKE TRACY WITH YOU. NO. I'M COMIN' BACK! NO, SHE'LL BE ALL ALONE. TAKE IT. I'M COMIN' BACK! I'M COMIN' BACK! TAKE IT! I'M COMIN' BACK. - I PROMISE YOU. - OKAY. TRACY. TRACY. TRACY, I'LL BE BACK! STAY AWAY FROM ME, TRINA. I MEAN IT. AW, COME ON, FRANK. YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. IT ALL WENT WRONG. NOW YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE TO UNDO YOUR MISTAKE. THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. GIVE ME THE DIAMONDS. THIS HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH ME. WHAT, YOU DON'T WANNA GIVE THEM TO ME? YOU WANNA KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELF? IS THAT IT? OKAY. WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KILL ME FIRST. TRINA. I WON'T GIVE THEM TO YOU, TRINA. I WON'T. YOU DID IT FOR MY MOTHER. YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM. - WHY WON'T YOU GIVE THEM TO ME? - LISTEN TO ME. - BECAUSE THEY'LL DESTROY YOU! - IT IS OVER BETWEEN YOUR FATHER AND I. YOU STOLE FOR HER. YOU LIED FOR HER. - DID EVERYTHING SHE EVER ASKED YOU. - IT HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME. - NO. - IT WAS WRONG. I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT. - WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME THEN? - THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU. I CAN'T STAND HERE AND LET HIM SQUANDER YOUR WHOLE LIFE. NO, YOU'RE LEAVING US! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME, HUH? WHAT IS IT? - NO, I WOULDN'T LEAVE YOU. - AM I STUPID? AM I UGLY? WHAT DID SHE DO? WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO? SHUT UP! I'M TAKING YOU WITH ME. TRINA! NO! WHERE DID YOU PUT THEM, HUH? NO! I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT YOU! - WHERE ARE THE DIAMONDS? - I AM NOT LEAVING YOU. - WHERE ARE THE DIAMONDS? - LISTEN TO ME! - COME ON. - DAMN IT! CALM DOWN! - TRINA! - NO. STOP! - WHERE ARE THEY? - NO! - TRINA, I'M TAKING YOU WITH ME. TRINA! WHA-- FRANK. FRANK! WHA-- FRANK. WH-- YOU CAN'T GO. DAD'S GONNA FIND THE DIAMONDS. WHERE ARE THE DIAMONDS? NO. NO! NO!
