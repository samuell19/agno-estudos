Toho company, ltd. Long ago, before the gods and humans were separated... Thrace Hey, mom! They called you the mother goddess of Olympus, and now you're content living like this? Surely you haven't forgotten the past, demeter? Think about that bastard, Poseidon. What he did was unforgivable. Now he controls everything. Zeus, being Zeus, isn't satisfied with his position on Olympus, but prattles on about being the god of the heavens. Arion! Are you still awake? Should children eavesdrop on adult conversations? Go back to bed right now. Hades, as you can see, my life with arion is everything to me now. You can complain all you like, but you're wasting your breath. Go home, to your own land. Are you listening? This is digitalis. If you crush it, you can use it to bring down a fever. This is mugwort. You mix it with fish mint to make an ointment. ';I in», a; well, well, you certainly are a knowledgeable lad, arion. Mom taught me all of this! But... I feel sorry for her. She can't see. And there are no medicinal plants that can cure her blindness. There's a flower called "arcana" in Macedonia. It cures all eye-related maladies, right there and then. Yes. Come to think of it, I spotted several on my way here, on the other side of that mountain pass. Want to check it out with me, arion? Arion! Where are you?! Are we almost there, uncle? Just a little more. I saw them just a little farther on. B-But I have to get back home! Uncle, I can't do this! «jul! If, gii', j: ' Your older brother, Hades, is taking arion away to the underworld! Are you going to turn a blind eye to this?! Zeus! Executive producers yasuyoshi tokuma kazuo haruna ritsuo isobe masanori ito Character designerl animation director yoshlkazu yasuhlko assisant character designer ryouko yamagishi art director hidetoshi kaneko Original work/director yoshikazu yasuhiko How is he doing? Is a brat like that really so powerful? Don't! Get away from me! Go away! Gido, eh? This is what I've been waiting for! Arion! My hopes for you were well-placed. You truly are a titan. Liar! Uncle, you're nothing but a liar! You cannot heal your mother's eyes with mere medicinal herbs. “If, , take me home! Take me back to mom! It would do her no good. Why not?! Because a spell has been placed on her eyes. A spell? Indeed. And until that spell is lifted, demeter will remain blind. You really want to know? Zeus is responsible! The titans' disgraceful attack robbed demeter of her sight! Zeus is in his castle on the western summit of Olympus! If you fight for your mother's sake, you shall be invincible! You will have nothing to fear from Zeus, nor your worthless father, Poseidon, who abandoned you and your mother! Go to Olympus and then present the gray-haired head of Zeus to your mother, demeter! Following the death of their father, king cronus, the three brothers of the royal titan family divided up his territory into three domains. The shrewd youngest brother, Zeus, became the king of Olympus and all things on land. The middle brother, Poseidon, became the king of the sea. However, Zeus and Poseidon fought with each other over everything. Poseidon, ruler of the seven seas, encroached upon the surface world. Zeus, with his eldest daughter Athena as his commander-in-chief, tried to crush the sea king's ambitions. Now the whole world is in the middle of a war... How do you like them apples?! Nobody can catch seneca! Dammit! Fine, do what you want with me! What's this? You're showing me mercy? I don't want your pity! Y-You're a titan, aren't you? You are, aren't you? I knew it! Titan miscreant! Dammit! On your high horse... How dare you! I see. So this boy... He is very talented for a child. It seems there are special circumstances, but what do you think we should do, sister? Very well. Let's try beating the answers out of him. Get back, resphoina! Talk! Where did you get that sword?! You're one of Hades' lackeys, aren't you? Why do you have that?! Speak! What is your relation to Hades? What did Hades tell you?! I respect you, boy. Hades is a scheming bastard. He isn't satisfied with the underworld alone, so he's probably using that brat to cause trouble. Stay away! Resphoina... That's your name, isn't it? Thank you. It doesn't hurt anymore. 7' li? [1,, thank you. Maybe you're not able to speak? Oh... It's really good! What's wrong? Aren't you going to continue your song? Jl qqu although it was a bit boring without any lyrics... Try to sing. Project your voice. Sing, resphoina. Now, sing out. Sing, resphoina. That is contemptible behavior, brother! Leave that girl alone! A pity... We were just getting to the good part. If you weren't my brother, I would slay you right here! Now begone! This is no place for a lecher like you to be wandering around! A holy warzone, is it? True, it doesn't seem like a good fit for me. I have taken up enough of your time, Ares. Oh, that's right. The boy, his name is arion? It seems he's recovering quite well. Be sure to take good care of him. I've heard that this night will be his last. I understand. I should follow that valley, right? Thank you, resphoina. I won't forget you, I swear it. After all, other than my mother, you're the first person who's ever shown me kindness. Goodbye, resphoina. I'm sorry. Bro... You! The sword, right? You want it back, right? It's that way. I know where they've got it. Come on... follow me. Leave it to me. This kind of thing is my specialty. I'd feel guilty if I didn't pay back the favor. Don't let them get away! Capture them! Poseidon is coming! T-That's right. That's Poseidon's military force! T-They're gonna go to war! Oh, man! Don't get cocky and dive too deep! You've taken captives already? What? They're only children. They're not strong enough to be rowing slaves... You over there! Show me what you've got! I'd better show it to the king. At any rate, it's too good for the likes of you. Dammit! Let me down, you bastards! Enough! Let me go! Scum! Damnit... Hey, bro, do you think we'll die in this heat? That's gotta be the commander's ship! Is that... Is that my father? The soldiers are agitated. Calm yourselves! We shall be the Victors of this war! We hold the locational advantage. The enemy will be helpless before us. The iron cavalry of the titans is invincible! Even though we face Poseidon, there is nothing to fear! Ares will lead the vanguard, attacking the enemy head on and dividing them into two. The phalanx will push them back. The edmos detachment will stand here, blocking their path of retreat to the sea. Do not let them escape to the sea. You will not allow a single warship from Poseidon's army to sail away safely from this bay. Go ahead, eat. Don't be shy. Look at that sulky face. No one has ever turned down my hospitality and lived. Drink. Your father is offering it to you. Fine then. Your mood would only spoil the liquor anyway. Um... H pi"? A“! Qliqi/lj: I jjl.',” 'z Father, why are you trying to defeat Zeus? Why are you attacking the land instead of being satisfied with ruling the sea? And why did you abandon mom and me?! You ask me a series of weighty questions. A man has no need for soft words like "why." Though we are both titans, we cannot abide being equals. Zeus believes himself to be the supreme ruler, but I refuse to accept that. I hear you were in Athena's camp. How do you mean? Zeus is a senile old fool, but making that little girl a general?! Did you meet a girl by the name of resphoina? She's your sister. Rumor has it she's resigned to her fate as Athena's attendant. Ah, well. Listen, I shall do what I must. The only way to get what I want is by grabbing it with my own hands. I'll show you... My way of war. Stay in formation! I can smell it, riding on the wind. Cerberus, war is near! Let's go. Don't be afraid of your first battle. Strike their fangs! Push their front ranks back! The third company has been penetrated?! Yes, sir! There's nothing more we can do! I believe this camp is already in danger! Gather everyone! I'm going out there! W-Wait, ma'am! Please, wait! If anything were to happen to you, lady Athena... Who's there?! Show yourself now! I said, who's there?! You... You killed... Ares... Fortune favors you, boy. If I had known you were arion before, I would have ripped you limb from limb! Athena! Now I'm your true enemy! As the son of Poseidon... as a soldier... I'm going to... kill you! III; If my sister's blood is to be spilled... I've no wish to see it. Lady Athena! Are you all right?! Are you hurt?! Go after him! What are you doing?! Resphoina, be careful! What's wrong, my little arion? Does the rain sound like the voice of someone who's dear to you? Shut your mouth! I'll make you pay! I won't let anyone stand in my way! No matter who they are... Childish. You haven't grown up yet, boy. No one is a doll made from Clay. That goes for you too. Things won't happen simply because you wish for them to. To say nothing of the fact you're a titan. One born under a particularly unlucky star, at that. It!!! I stirred up a hornet's nest, eh? Of all people, I didn't think I would run into you here. What are you doing here?! I was bored by my gloomy domain. So I came to observe the spectacle of war. You're so jealous of Zeus and Poseidon that you used cunning to trick me, then an ignorant child, into doing your bidding! That's right! You're the most shameful of them all, Hades! Are you going to kill me? You can if you so wish, Poseidon has gulled you completely. Shut up! Don't insult my father! You're as much an enemy to me and my father as Olympus! There's no point in murdering me. You wouldn't profit from it. Have you forgotten who trained you in the underworld? I curse you! You will suffer in agony that not even death can save you from! You will drag your carcass all over the world, utterly alone! You don't look well, Athena. Do you know how much I've suffered, all because I have a cowardly brother like you?! I'm sure you think you incurred a favor back there with arion, but I don't see it as you saving my life. So curb your arrogance. That's harsh. I only came here tonight to ask you a favor. A favor? Yes. I would like you to share one of your attendants with me. You know the one... The girl named resphoina. Resphoina... Would you give her to me? I've taken a liking to her, you see. You have strange tastes. I see. That little girl, eh? What are you doing? Who... who are you? Follow me! Hurry! Resphoina... You can... talk now! What are you going on about, arion? You're weird. Aren't you glad that you're going far away with me? No! You mustn't go that way! Mom! Look! The herb that will let you see again! Xii, . an g it's a terrible poison. And who are you, anyway? You're not my child. Are you all right, bro? Seneca... You were moaning in your sleep. Did you have a nightmare? Blame it on the rain during the battle. Hey, do you want me to call for old man Poseidon? No, that's okay, seneca. He would only laugh at me, for being so weak that a little rain made me sick... - But... - I already feel much better. I'm fine, so you go to sleep now too, seneca. Are you sure? My feet... Are heavy... Why are they so heavy? Why? There's no point in murdering me. No point! W-What's wrong, bro?! - What is it?! - What's wrong?! H-Help him! He's... Oh no! He'll bite his tongue off! I adj! ;Qjl£ lu j luji j" if I'll go get Poseidon! No matter where you go, I shall haunt you. No point! There's no point! You're going to attack me again, Hades?! Seneca... What did I do to my father?! Something's wrong. N" .' .! Lid " “ f" no! It seems an assassin has infiltrated the camp! 'C , I can't run anymore! You have to! If we drag our feet here, they'll capture us easily! My father's still there. I have to go back! Get a hold of yourself! D-Do you have a death wish?! You're done running! How dare you kill your own father! How much did Olympus pay you?! You've got it wrong! I would never do that! Quit your prattling! D-Don't recoil! Avenge the king! Why aren't you killing them?! I can't! They're my father's allies! It looks like this is the end of the line for you. Prepare to die, Olympus spy! You're alive?! So you've come. I am tisiphone. We have seen much strife here, titan Zeus! Thank you for coming, goddesses of vengeance! This is the end of the haughty fool who feared no gods! Moreover, the one who did the deed is... One of the twins begotten by Poseidon and demeter. After their vile coupling 15 years ago, demeter fled to thrace, where she gave birth to a daughter and arion! The cursed child born from the disgrace of Olympus! E He broke the holy law of the titans! What shall be his punishment, erinyes?! Death is the only recompense! As you wish! I respect your wise judgment! Henceforth, arion's life is in your hands! After Poseidon's army lost its king, after Poseidon's army lost its king, Athena's army launched a devastating counterattack. The powerful army of the sea was wiped out. Mount athos the green stuff doesn't burn as good, dammit... Ehhhh... I hope bro gets better soon. Iji.' if ' I'm sure you can find your own food! I can't take care of a giant! One who has known you since you were a baby. Who are you?! What's your name?! You can call me the black lion king. Lion king? You're Hades, aren't you?! That's right! It has to be! Wearing such an obvious mask... You've come here to deceive me again, haven't you?! I feel sorry for you, it seems you really are hurting. But don't lose heart, arion. You mustn't show your enemies weakness. I don't care! I don't care what happens anymore! I killed my father! My enemies? I don't care about them or anyone! After all, I'm a murderer! But I won't let anyone tell me what to do. '. It, I know! I'll kill myself! Then no one will ever be able to use me again! Isn't that right?! I... It's very simple. Take a half step forward and you will certainly die. Can you take that one small step? That's the way it is. Even though people are used and deceived, they survive. And that's how they become their true selves. So become strong, arion! Become much stronger than you already are. Since ancient times, it's been known as the "mountain of spirits." Walk along the Ridge and climb up the west face. A hermit named lycaon should be there. He was once venerated as the king of arcadia. But ever since the world entered the age of titans, he has secluded himself on this mountain, I hear. He will help you. Lycaon... H-Hold on, we're just testing for poison! Where did that man go?! Man? We didn't see anyone. You must have! I mean, he was wearing black clothing and a lion mask! Have a seat. Tell me, what's wrong? I went to the trouble of inviting you here, so it's bothersome if you're not enjoying yourself. I've ordered everyone else out. Right now it's just the two of us here. I appreciate the hospitality. After everything, I don't know that we can ever get along, but more importantly... How long do you intend to act so boringly aloof? We won the battle, yes, but Ares is gone. And you know how Zeus is... You take my meaning, don't you? You reek. This perfume? No, not that. Perhaps it is the scent of... blood. It must have seeped into your skin. Splashing a bit of perfume on can't mask the odor. Besides, titan mores don't appeal to me, and I have no interest whatsoever in close relatives. Luckily for me... Do you think I'm just acting here?! Do you see me as a heartless woman who would butter a man up for her own gain?! You really don't want me to answer that. - Hey! Get away from here! - This isn't a show! Stop it! What do you think you're doing?! This is pathetic! What are you looking at?! Untie her! Then treat her wounds! Hurry! Apollo... I never want to see your face again. If I do... I'll kill you. I know... I would end up killing you. Wait up, bro. Let's take it nice and slow. You think an old man like that even really lives here? Jig enough is enough... I!!! What are you doing?! Who are you?! Are you with lycaon?! No questions! Listen to me! I mean you no harm! I'm only here to see the king! You're annoying me! I'm well aware of your intentions! That's enough! You're... Huh. So that's his pet... Forgive him. He doesn't trust anyone. His name is heracles and he used to be a bandit, but now he serves as my gatekeeper. He's good at heart. Why do you live here? It's no longer a place for me. My family all died out once we cozied up to Zeus. Moreover I am an eyesore to him, one he'd sooner be rid of. So they've come. Arion, son of Poseidon. We are here to take you to the place of judgement! You mean to interfere, lycaon? Give us the boy! He has committed the sin of patricide! Quit your babbling, erinyes. I will not give arion to the lapdogs of Olympus! Return to Olympus and tell that to Zeus! Begone, you bellowing dogs! In a place beyond time and space. . M; Z whatever happens, stay with me. Otherwise, you'll never be able to make it back home. Hui I' the titans established an empire here in dalukia long ago. Uranus was king of that nation. However, he was murdered by his son, cronus. And then cronus was killed in turn by his own son, Zeus. Fearing that he, too, will follow that same fate, he is suspicious of everyone... Protecting himself through laws, incantations, and prayers. But observe this unsightly conflict. In the end, the titans received divine judgment. They abandoned their country Stop it! Is this Olympus? Resphoina... I missed you, resphoina. I didn't know... I didn't know you were my sister. J r 71'!! 7 I!” w!“ w III., “m3 ' I Impudent whelp... The erinyes and I were all originally arcadian royalty. That's why they were resurrected in the underworld. They have become goddesses that enforce the laws of Olympus, thereby protecting Zeus. It's very sad. But Apollo's hidden power is different from the erinyes' spiritual power. He is the manifestation of the titans' devilishness. Do you understand, arion? Your true enemy is Apollo, the next ruler of Olympus! B-But I don't have hidden power, spiritual power, or anything like that! You didn't see it? When we were on that phantasmagorical journey, you didn't see the thread of fate that will be your ally in the end? Resphoina... Take care, arion. This will likely be your final venture. But this time, no one is making you go. You'll go to Olympus to rescue resphoina. And you'll do it as arion, and no other. Lycaon... For disobeying the sacred gods and many hostile actions against Olympus. The reign of the titans is eternal! May Zeus receive divine protection! May Zeus receive divine protection! May Zeus receive divine protection! You have done well, Athena. I'm proud of you. You are the treasure of Olympus. That fool Poseidon is probably in the underworld right now, stamping his feet in frustration. Are you arion? Now you can leave. Resphoina, I thought I warned you... That the next time you and Apollo came before me, your lives would be forfeit! Unlike Apollo, I hate joking around. If I say I'm going to kill you, I mean it! If you want to hate someone, don't hate me. You should hold a grudge against Apollo, who hurt me and trifled with you! Oh, did the baby wake you up? Even though you're exhausted from your long journey... I apologize for his fussiness. Hey, I wonder if he's really sick. Cl tilt ',"jl, 1: You wasted it on us... That medicine must be very expensive. Not at all. My mother taught me how to make it. You make it by mixing false Daphne and musk oil. There, it makes your chest feel refreshed, doesn't it? I see. Your mother taught you. I wonder if your mother is around pandora's age. F j'I: No, these children are orphans. Pandora is my daughter. She married a fine man, prometheus. It's a tragic tale. She was pregnant then... Poor thing... If she were alive today, I know she would've wanted to see her children. Ma'am, pardon me for interrupting your grieving, but where did your husband 90? Oh, he, uh... J... '4, I, ;, m I really do, though! Follow me! I'll show you! H-Hey! Hurry up! What are you doing?! He's on this island, right? Y-Yeah. .J'I that old man is here by himself? Well, let's go in. Why not? 4! I!!! Grandpa said there's something important in here, so children aren't allowed! All right. I'll take a look. Everyone else stay here, okay? Children aren't allowed! Grandpa would get mad at you! Fine, I'll wait here! But I ain't no dang kid! That man... We secretly worship him as a god. Zjc then this is the man who married your daughter, pandora? My wife told you that too? I shouldn't be surprised. Your name is ethos, right? Tell me more about this man. I?!” ;L!, I';1“, 'ij it's a secret weapon used since ages past to keep the power of the titans from rising. Prometheus told us that the source of Zeus' hidden power, the power of thunder, is this thunder Cannon. That's why he told us we need not worship the titans. But then they executed him for committing treason against the royal family. Chaining him up on a rocky mountain? We didn't lift a finger to resist when they took him away. And for these past 15 years, not a day has gone by that I didn't regret it. Prometheus was of the nobility. As a nephew of the former ruler, cronus, he was cousins with Zeus and his siblings. And yet he married my daughter, pandora... A girl who had no connection to the titans. Why? I suppose he wished for the titans to truly thrive. The titan clan was lost in a labyrinth of shame with no exit, and he wanted to lead them to a new horizon, a harmonious relationship with us. That's why he associated with us and dared to share the titans' secret. I feel like I've known him all my life, but why? This is... Please address them, arion! I can't do this, I... My father is Poseidon. My mother is demeter. Db, ' hie! But Zeus is hunting me down. It's because I fell into a trap and killed my father with my own two hands! That's why I have to fight Zeus! I'm going to Olympus to fight! But... but it's really because someone I love is in Olympus! Apollo has captured my beloved resphoina! Resphoina is my little sister... I'm going to Olympus! Everyone! If any of you wish to join me, then come! I will take any who would stand with me! If you come with me, we will fight together! I go to fight for resphoina's sake! That is my only goal! And isn't that reason enough? Then you'll all come with me and battle Zeus?! Let's go! To Olympus! Poseidon's son raised an army! Thilgf if; G j' thessaly, oetaea, epirus... Soldiers from all over are joining his ranks! The titans have brought this on themselves! The enemy's been caught off balance! I hear they're smashing through the enemy gates! I expect Olympus doesn't have their guard down now though. Hey, old man, will this thunder Cannon thing really work? Prometheus himself made it... How could I not have faith? If you say so... Gaia! Arion, son of Poseidon, is coming this way! The peasants have taken up arms for his cause! Oh, what can we do?! Great mother gaia, tell me what to do! Zeus... You are a pathetic sight. Why are you so fearful? No matter how old you become, you are always incompetent. The title "king of all creation" cries tears of shame. Let go! Let me end this with one strike! Losing you to this little girl! I really do love you! Apollo... How's this, old man? More to the right. There, it's in the shadow of the cliff. The plan is to collect light from the rising sun and then fire one cataclysmic burst. In any case, that's how the titans did it. Then the castle probably has the upper hand. They have more soldiers and will catch the rays of the rising sun first. But they don't know we have a thunder Cannon too... Ethos, we can't defeat Olympus with the power of the thunder Cannon alone. I just know it. We need a different kind of power to win. A different kind of power to win... So this is where you've been, bro! You'll get a chill. The battle is imminent. We can't afford to let you get sick. Thanks. Did you get any sleep, seneca? Yeah, right! There's no way I could sleep at a time like this... Bro... You really do love... That resphoina girl, don't you? I can't believe it... I'm jealous. What's wrong, seneca? I envy her! I'm jealous of the girl you care so much about! When I love you so much, bro! General! Where are you, general?! It's dawn, general! Don't celebrate yet! We need to storm the castle first! Ready?! Fire! I! I"; ' Everyone will be slaughtered! Ethos, stop them! There's no stopping them now! We must advance, arion! No good! The castle won't fall like this! Typho! You're a sight for sore eyes! ' Fi!“, no, a beast! It doesn't matter though. He can help us! No, typho! The castle is over there! He intends to cross the valley of tartarus! But this is the only way to avoid the thunder Cannon fire! The creature is probably doing what king lycaon instructed! Grab my hand! Hurry! Never mind! I'm ready to die! Arion, the truth is, you're... Olympus! We're going to jump! Hold on to gido! Go on, general! Come on, seneca! Don't worry about me. Get a move on. Hang in there. Just stay still! Go on, I said! I'm fine! Y-You're... I told you I loved you, bro. It's silly. A girl on her own in an age like this! So I made myself look like a man. I stole things and did whatever else I had to do! Is that so wrong?! Sir. Don't... You need to keep still, seneca. Just go. Go to resphoina. I'm sure she's waiting for you. Go, I said! Do you feel sorry for me? Stay right here. Don't tell me what to do! Soon as you leave, I'm outta here! He's so cool. Dammit... H-Help me! Where is resphoina?! Where are you hiding her?! That's it! Rip him limb from limb! He's a patricidal monster! The black lion king... Step aside! I don't know who you are, but it is our duty to punish that boy! If you interfere, then you will pay as well. This boy has committed no sin. True, he killed king Poseidon by accident, arion's true mother is pandora and his true father is prometheus. In other words, me! You recognize my face, don't you? In the vision lycaon showed you. And then you must have seen me in the cave of my old friend, ethos. My wife, pandora, was in labor, Fortunately, the baby was still breathing. Arion, I cut open pandora's belly and retrieved you. You are pandora's and my child. I entrusted demeter to raise you. She was prepared to accept Zeus' scorn. Demeter swore that she would raise you as her own son, right alongside her daughter, resphoina. That's because mom, I mean, demeter loved you! I'm sure of it! And you were in love with demeter. Just as you loved pandora... No, maybe even more than that! Am iwrong, prometheus?! It's a lie! A foolish made-up story! It's drivel spun by scum who have no fear of a god's judgment! Erinyes, punish them both! Divine judgment is supposed to be just and fair! But you wretches ignored justice and turned a blind eye to Zeus' corruption! By so doing, you have sinned yourselves! Begone! Return to being goddesses of folklore and devote yourselves to the people! You see? That, more than anything, is proof of the truth. The age of the titans is over! Accept it, Zeus! Forgive me! We're not strangers! W-We're blood relatives, aren't we?! H-H-Help! Cease tormenting Zeus. He's still incompetent. He's like a baby. He's not the one you want to blame. Excuse me, great mother gaia. I have heard that death shall never come calling for the mother of titans. Does that surprise you? It's true. I will live forever alongside my clan. And as long as I am alive, my clan shall not perish. Then you must die! Die here alongside Zeus! How would you even kill me? You're responsible for cronus becoming king and were behind the death of your husband, uranus, true? Then you copulated with your own son, cronus, and gave birth to your grandson, Zeus, whom you persuaded to kill cronus! When you're an eternal mother, men are only useful for a limited time. They eventually become liabilities. By that reasoning, you mean to have Zeus murdered as well someday?! Don't you see that every mistake the titans made was due to your so-called mothering? Gaia, this is my last warning. The titans will be destroyed and you will fade to nothingness. Eventually the humans will create a new world. Only then can the titans become true gods. But at this rate, you will only commit sin after sin with your ugly... [My forgive me, arion. I have lied to you more than anyone. Stop! How can you...? All right, resphoina. Enough. You're just like that woman... Why won't you do as I say? Like... like me, you could become the mother of all creation, both you and demeter! Stop it! You've already won... Damn you... It... it's all over. Stop... M-My body... Resphoina! Wake up, resphoina! You can't die on me! Don't die, resphoina! Everything has come crashing down, and where have you been? You're absolutely useless! From now on, I need to get my power from you... Cronus murdered his father, uranus. And then you murdered your father, cronus. How is it you didn't realize that I, in turn, would murder you? Is resphoina dead? Give resphoina to me! That girl is my hope. To you, she may be a mere sweetheart. , 4,“!!'L~. Jll', ' She's too good for you. I know what you're up to. Now that you've lost everything, you intend to recreate the titans with resphoina. Just like gaia and uranus did, long, long ago. But I won't let you do that. Resphoina isn't like gaia! Resphoina is mom's... The kind demeter's child! Resphoina is... resphoina is... Anyway, she's already dead! She was so drained... So hurt in the fight with gaia! I'm not afraid of anything now! I'll go anywhere with resphoina! But you have the blood of a human flowing through your veins. The blood of your mother, pandora! Even so, I won't lose to you! The titans must not perish. The titans gave humans knowledge. It would take the humans thousands of years to catch up with the titans' legacy. Like the thunder Cannon? What good is that?! A weapon that massacres people and instills meaningless fear into people's hearts! That's just the fruit of endeavor. More than anything, people want kindness, warm clothes, and food! If they have that, they'll be happy! People want more than that. They want gods. That's right. How else do you think people will delude themselves to get through storms, sickness, and war? How do you think people will regulate their minds against impure thoughts? Humans need something beautiful that's superior to themselves to govern their souls. After their past has been erased and their disgrace removed, that's just your own ego talking! If you think you're in the right, then prove it! Prove it by defeating me. If you can do that, I'll be a good sport and disappear for good. What do you say to that, arion?! Resphoina... Arion... Resphoina... You can talk... What was that? I feel like I had a long dream. But then I heard someone calling me. And I searched... for whoever it was... In the end... it was you, arion. Everyone's here. The age of the titans is over. From now on, people can live their lives as they see fit. Where shall we go? “ Til;:;! Li/q} It I'm sure mom is waiting for us. You will come with me, won't you, resphoina? I want to see you so badly that I 'ii soar up high into the blue sky I want to see you so badly that my flying heart will become a winged white horse I'm done being a girl who sits around moping with her chin... In her hands I 'ii overcome an interfering fate so I can... See you isee you cut a green apple please give me the courage to rush into your arms I want to see you so badly that I 'ii slip through the valley of clouds in one go I want to see you so badly that my eyes are probably shining brighter than the sun The end
