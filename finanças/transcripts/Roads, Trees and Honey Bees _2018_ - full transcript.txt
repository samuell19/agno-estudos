Hey guys. Daddy! Hey, come here! Oh, muah, muah, muah. Daddy, don't forget to give Maddie a kiss. Who's Maddie? She's the most beautiful princess in the land. Yeah, well I know a princess that is far more beautiful than she. Really? Yeah. Who? It's a secret. Tell me. Okay, she's beautiful. She's got long brown hair, bright blue eyes. She loves the color teal. And she's very, very afraid of the tickle monster! The tickle monster. Hey bud. Hey Dad. Why's the front door open? Mom's cooking again. Oh. Yup, she's cussin' like a sailor in there. Alright guys, I'm gonna go in, I'm gonna do some damage control, and if I'm not back in 10 minutes, call Grandma. Okay. Damn it. Ow! Shit! Well, it looks like the chicken's done. You okay? Hi, can I have a large pizza please? Half cheese and half pepperoni. Uh, yes, I guess garlic bread. You don't have to do that, I can whip somethin' up. No, no, I'll pick it up myself. 15 minutes, great. Thanks. You haven't cooked in years. Yeah, but you don't have to go pick it up, we can have it delivered. Right? I gotta get outta this house. Who will become America's most talented new act? Results, when we return with Million Dollar... I'm sorry this took so long, they messed it up and had to remake it. Is Mommy mad? No, honey, Mommy's fine. She looks mad. Okay, kids. It's time for bed. But we don't know who won yet. Bed, now. We're gonna watch it tomorrow. Come on. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine, you awake? Hi, I'm Josh Grobon, and I wanna thank you for listening to this audio cassette. You should be proud of yourself for taking the first steps to finding your inner happiness. Nope. True happiness comes from taking small and effective steps toward becoming the man or woman who you wanna be. You can have happiness and in fact, I would say you deserve happiness. Now is the time to figure out what feeds you and throw away the things that don't. If it doesn't motivate you, if it doesn't allow you to grow anymore, it's time to let it go and move forward. Guess what? You have to start today. If not today, then when? Come in! Ho ho! Hide the pornography, your new boss is in the house. You got a second? Yeah, I was just about to take my lunch break. Have a seat. Mm, Tony's. I like that place. Yeah, me too. What can I do for you, Nick? Oh, you know I just wanted to make sure there wasn't any hostility between us. You know, with me getting the promotion and all. You know? Thanks Nick. Of course. Well, I appreciate you coming in, but we're good. Oh yeah, by the way, you have another field trip today. Fourth graders this time. Joy. So basically, the water and waste are separated. After that's completed, it goes to the filtration system, where it's... After that's completed, it goes to the filtration system, where it's... Goes to the filtration system, where it's... You need to stop that and take your class back. I'm done. Where are you goin'? I'm outta here. Man, what about the children? I quit! Alright, bro, you do you. I did it, I did it. Hold on, man. Okay, what'd you do? Is that sweat? Did you run a marathon? What's going on down there? No, I'm trying to fix the sink, the plumbing. There's something wrong with it. Okay, come on, tell me, what'd you do? I quit my job. You quit your job? Just now. Whoa, 10 minutes ago, but you get it. Obviously. I feel... I feel liberated. Hit me with a beer. Dude, Catherine's gonna kill you. What? Why would you say that, why would you just assume that I didn't run it by her first? Well, did you? No. It was that tape that you gave me. Ah, you finally listened to it, huh? Yeah, I did. You know, I never quite realized how miserable I was at my job, just bored out of my mind. It used to feed me, but it doesn't feed me, not anymore. I see. Catherine knows that. She'll understand. She will. If you say so. She will. God, you quit your job, Steve. How can you make a decision that affects both of our lives and not even run it by me? I know, I just... You are so selfish. I wasn't happy Catherine. I hated that job. It was the most pathetic I've ever felt in my entire life. And you knew that. Yeah, I did. You've been mopin' around the house every morning for almost a year. You don't like your job? Fine, I get it. But who does? What, you just woke up this morning, and you decided to do something crazy? God, have you seen the bills, Steve? Yes! Great! Then you've seen that we can't pay 'em. This wasn't about the money. Logan wants to play soccer, that costs money. Are you gonna tell him that he can't play? Or does that land on me? I hate being the bad guy. I have sacrificed so much for you and this family. I know you have. I wanted to work, do you remember that? Yeah. But you wanted to be the bread winner. And what? Now you've changed your mind? You don't want that role anymore? God, I can't handle this. I cannot handle your midlife crisis right now. My midlife crisis. Yes. I can't keep doing this. What? Steve, I want a divorce. What? I don't want this anymore. But I love you. Doesn't matter. You and I, we're not happy people anymore. So we'll talk tomorrow, then? So I told you guys I already got divorced. Wife got the kids. I get to see them about once a week now. For like, an hour. About the same time that you guys get to see your proctologist every week. Anyway, it's not all bad, cooking's really fun. Until you look up the recipe and can't find a single serving when it's just for two people. Constant reminder. But, good news is, I don't have to buy salts anymore. I can just use my tears. Dude, your phone's ringing. Who is it? It's your brother. Ignore it. My mother in law, she's a really gem. Dude, it keeps on ringing. Can't you see I'm in the middle of a set here, man? Just trying to do some hecklers, am I right? Yeah. Yeah, she's been filling my kids heads with all kinds of stuff. So to honor her, I got an M tattooed on this butt cheek. Thank you, thank you, you guys have been great. What? Mic drop. Dude, mics are expensive, come on. Get off the stage. Here, come here. I love my fans, thank you. Hey, friend. What's up? Who are you? Oh, this is Sarah. And Sarah, this is Steve. Hi. Let me get you a drink. Hey, hey. Be nice. How you guys know each other so well? Oh, I've known this one since we were in diapers. We grew up down the street from each other. Well, how come I haven't seen you around? Sarah, just graduated from college in the city. She was eager to leave us, small town folks, behind. What did you study? Business administration and management. Oh. Yeah, it's not as exciting as it sounds. I never said it sounded exciting. Oh. So you couldn't hack it in the city, why'd you come back here? What's with the 20 questions? I'm just trying to figure out what I'm working with here, 'cause my man, you know... Steve. Stop. What, I got your back, buddy. Dude. Stop. This man holds a special place in my heart. He took me in when I was a lost puppy. And it was cold outside and he gave me a home. And he is... Oh, please. Stop talking, okay. He has, since day one, had my back. And you know what? I got his too. And you come in here all young and smiley, like an angel, and I wanna make sure you're not, as the great Elvis Presley would say, the devil in disguise. R-I-P to the king. Let's start over. I'm Sarah, life long friend of David. Went to college for the past five years and today I officially just joined the rest of my generation by moving back in with my parents. So... That's exciting. It's nice to meet you, Sarah, I'm Steve, David's new roommate. Well, not that you're all friends. Cheers. Cheers! What was that? Yours was ginger ale. Why? Because I cut you off. You had too much to drink tonight. Haven't you ever heard of a water shot, genius? Carbonation like that could kill a man. Is that funny? That's my queue, I'm gonna go hit the hay. Hey, hey, hey. Aren't you gonna pay your bill? You know where I live. It's true, I do know where he lives. What is... Oh, Connor. Hey! What do you think? It's an original. Connor! Can I talk to you? We're playin'... Five, five, five guys. Sup? Don't you think it's a little early to be doing this? It is never too early for music. You gotta do it when the inspiration hits. To be honest, we gotta practice before Kyle's shift starts at Shake Hut. Our town got a Shake Hut? Mhm, last week, pretty cool, huh? Kyle gives us his discount so... It's awesome. Okay, I'm afraid to ask. Does this happen every morning? When the adults are away, the cool Cool Kats will play. Okay, well maybe you can start a little later next time, give people a chance to wake up in peace. Hmm, no can do, sorry. Alright boys, break time is over. Let's give me two ones and a bottle of brew. You're a jerk, Connor. I can't hear you. I swear you're adopted! Ha! We're not open yet, sorry. We're not open, yet. Hey, Sarah, what's up? Hi. What are ya doing up there? That light was flickering, but it looks like it's working now. You must be my good luck charm. What's wrong? Everything okay? Yeah, just got woke up by Connor and his stupid band. Oh, Cool Kats, nice. You know them? Yeah, they played here a couple times. They're pretty good. And really loud. That too. Can I use your razor? Mine has some weird stuff on it. Dude, put some pants on, this is a business. Calm down, you're not even open yet. Sarah? Nice to see you again. Likewise. Dude, pants. Dude, razor. Second drawer on the left. Thank you. And turn the oven off this time. I will! God. He will not stop cooking. I mean, there's dishes everywhere. How hard is it to put a dish in a dishwasher? So, how long have you two been together? Hilarious, Sarah. Anyways, what are you doing for the rest of the day? I don't know, was hoping to hang out here for little bit. Yeah? You're just gonna hang out at the bar with me? Is that okay? Yeah, fine with me. Cool. Hey, man, you want a drink? I have to pack, I'm leaving tomorrow. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you mean pack? Where you going? I have to go to California tomorrow, pick up my dad and move him back here. I thought your brother was taking care of him? So did I. But apparently, he's got better things to do. Oh, man. I'm sorry to hear that. This is my brother we're talking about, I should've seen this coming. Hey, if there's anything I can do to help, let me know, okay? Thank you. Is he gonna be okay? Where are you going? I am going to audition for Million Dollar Entertainer. What? Million Dollar Entertainer, the TV show. No, I know the TV show. What, you and the Cool Kats? No, screw the Cool Kats they're a bunch of losers. Wow, that's a complete change from this morning. Well yeah, well, I thought we were gonna miss the local auditions because Kyle had a shift at Shake Hut. But apparently that's not true. Apparently it's because nobody thinks we can make it into anything other than a band in my parent's basement. Well, maybe they're right. You too? Ha, well you know what? I'm letting any of ya hold me back. I'm going to California, auditions are in LA. Three days from now, I'm gonna be there. Connor, this is ridiculous. Have you even told Mom and Dad. Yes, I did. I texted them this morning. And Mom said, and I quote, have fun, make sure Sarah takes care of RoX. You have to take care of the dog. This is crazy. You can't go to a city like that by yourself. Yeah, well I am. Unless, you want to come with me. That's even crazier. Yeah? What are you doing these days, Miss business administration and management? Whoa. You could be my manager. I mean, your professors did think you were start enough to graduate, and you are my sister. So I guess I can trust you. Aw, thank you. I actually need some help with travel costs. So it's more like a somewhat costly adventure with some learning involved. How you gettin' there? I haven't totally thought that one through yet. Do you know anyone going to California? Do you? Hey, thank you for driving us. That was really nice of you. Thank David, he made me. Okay. Will do. It's my payment for crashing in his place. Thank you, David. David just sent me a picture of Rox. Oh, let me see. Aw, how cute. Typical girls, taking advantage of the nice guys. Excuse me? Come on, you makin' him watch your dog, it's a classic use and abuse situation. I did not use and abuse him. He offered. Yeah, because he likes you. Everybody knows David's a cat person. No he's not, he's always been into dogs. That shows how much you know about him. Couple years ago, during a thunderstorm, he fell in love with a kitten names Whiskers. What? Yeah, it was a thunderstorm, David heard some meowing behind the dumpster. He looked down and there was this little cherub faced kitten lookin' up at him. Doey eyes. He picked it up and brought it inside and nursed it back to health, cuddled it all night. Just a man and his dumpster kitten. Sounds like a made up sap story. My car, my tunes. Love it man, rock on. Whoa, it's the Arch. Oh, wow. Huh. I always wanted to go up there. Me too. He what do you say, captain? There's no time. Oh, come on. Haven't you heard that half the fun is getting there. That doesn't apply to this trip, I don't even wanna be going. Well, my are you going? My dad's a great man. He always put his family first and taught us everything we know. He deserves better than that lunatic, some people call, my brother. How did he end up out there? After my mom passed, we thought some sunshine and a change of scenery would do him some good. Come on, captain. I heard that in order to get to the top of the Arch, you get to sit in these hard compact balls. Traveling up an arch above the city in hard compact balls, now that sounds like a solid adventure to me. No. I bet they have a cool gift shop. For the last time, no! I have to use the restroom. We have a few more miles before we can stop. Oh, are you serious? Look, I just wanna get there as fast as I can. We stop when we need gas and that's it. Come on. What was that? Come on. What'd we hit? Can we... Can we still drive on it? Can we? Are you serious right now? No, no, no, you can't drive on a flat tire. Okay. Hey, where you goin'? To pee, it's not like we're gonna hit a gas station any time soon. So what do we do? We call someone or somethin'? No, we change the tire. Like you and me? Yes. Okay. Flash flood warning? That's weird. I can't believe your dad never taught you how to change a tire. Yeah, you know, I guess he never got around to it. Smile. Selfie. Alright. Where is it? - Oh my god! - Oh! Open the doors! Oh my god, open the door! What the! Oh my god, we're soaking wet. Hey Connor, can you grab me some of my clothes from the back? That was exciting. Nope. Not a chance, you're sharing a bed with Sarah. I am not sharing a bed with my sister. Yeah, no, I am not sharing a bed with him. You two share. No, no, no. We are grown men, we're not sharing a bed either. Agreed. Alright well, I'm taking this one, you two figure it out. Youngest, floor. Now! Let's go. Can I at least get a pillow? Dude, I'm sorry, this floor is disgusting. Hey. Hi, checkin' out, sir? Yes, please. Great, and how was your stay? It was fine, thank you. Just one second, here. And you're set. Is there anything else I can do for you today? Yeah, you got any good breakfast places around here? You mean other than our complementary breakfast buffet? Okay. Well, if you prefer, there's a Paul's Pancakes down the road. A couple miles South of that, there's a Hamburger Luke's. A Weasel and Hutch. Did you say Weasel and Hutch? Yeah. That was my favorite restaurant as a kid. Well, it's a great one at that, sir. It's about 30 miles down the road. Thank you. Yup, have a good day. Guys, we're going to Weasel and Hutch. Come on. What's a Weasel and Hutch? You'll find out. ¶ I promised her that someday I'd write her a song. ¶ ¶ Just as pretty as she was... ¶ Oh my god, I can't believe we're here. How have you guys not been to a Weasel and Hutch before? What kinda childhood did you have? This place was my favorite restaurant growing up. It's got everything on the menu, everything. Pot roasts, pancakes, the sweet tea is unimaginable, it's literally amazing. This place inspired me to wanna be a chef when I was a kid. Here, everybody leaves happy. Whoo. He's finally lost it. - Hi. - Hi. Welcome to Weasel and Hutch. How many people in your party? Table for three please. We've got some first time Weasels today. Oh, great. Welcome Weasels. Cool, right this way. Right here, please. My dad used to take my brother and I here every weekend. And we could order whatever we wanted and we ordered everything. So much food would come to the table so quickly. And I always thought the chef was magical, that he had the ability to cook so many delicious dishes, so quickly. I just hope to have a gift like that one day. Great. If you guys wanna take a look at your menus, your server will be with you in just a sec. Thank you. They still have the exact same game on every table. Have you guys ever played this? This is the best game ever created. Looks like it. If memory serves me correctly, we divvy up the colors... Hi, my name is Daisy and I'll be taking care of you today. Can I get you started with something to drink. Three sweet teas and I think we're ready to order. But I... Oh, no, no, I got this. Trust me, I got this. May we have one Hutches' friend breakfast, extra bacon, some bow tie blueberry pancakes, buttermilk short stack with peach topping, extra whip cream, some fruit, cheese grits, and a side of macaroni and cheese. And that'll be shared for the table, please. Sounds good. Comin' right up. Um... I'm sorry, what did you just order? That was so good. It's heaven on Earth, man, really. Gut bomb. What's a gut bomb? You know when you eat too much unhealthy food too fast? Nope, never heard of it. Alright, folks, can I get you anything else? No, thank you. I think that's gonna be it. Okay, here's the check, whenever you're ready. Thank you. I got this. Thank you. You're welcome. Welcome to the club, guys. Now you've had the Weasel and Hutch experience. I like it. Hit the road? - Yeah. - Sure. Where are we? Just outside of Tulsa. Tulsa, Oklahoma? Yes. Can we stop at the golden oil drill? What? It's a 75 foot statue of a golden oil drill from when Tulsa was the oil capitol of America. Before Houston took over. How do you even know all that? This brochure. Where'd you get that? Got it at the Weasel and Hutch while you were going gaga in the gift shop. Come on, let's go see it. If I get a picture next to the golden oil drill, all my friends are gonna be so jealy. Jealy? Jealous. Have you been awake this whole time? Yes. Are you spying on us? No. Eavesdropping? No, I'm just resting my eyes. So, this oil driller... Fine. Really? Long enough to take one picture, you hear me? One, just one and then we're back on the road. ¶ But this poor gambler's heart won't go without a fight. ¶ David! Catherine! Hi. Hey, how are you. I'm... I'm okay. Did you get a dog? Oh, no, that's the Martin's dog. Oh, I thought he looked familiar. Hey, Rox. Yeah, Sarah asked me to watch him while she's gone. Sarah? Oh, Sarah. I didn't know she was back in town. Yeah, she was for a brief moment. But then she went to LA with Steve and Connor. Steve? Yeah. You know. Steve... Steve? My ex? Yeah, I thought he woulda told you. Interesting, he didn't mention it to me. Oh. Yeah. Sorry. I can't believe no one was there. That's like, the coolest statue in America. People are just driving by it. I can think of a few statues people may deem more important. Like? Statue of Liberty. Mount Rushmore. Rocky, top of the step, Philadelphia, Stallone. Look, I already got 65 likes. That make you happy? Yes, it does. Oh, shit, I gotta... I gotta take this, be quiet. Hello? Steve. Hello, Catherine. Where are you? I'm out driving right now, going to pick up some food. Drop the bullshit. I just saw Dave and he told me what you were doing. Of course he did. You're drive to Los Angeles? Are you insane? What is this, your second round of your midlife crisis? God, what am I gonna tell the kids? What do you mean, tell the kids? Sorry, Daddy can't take you this weekend. Because he's out gallivanting across the country... I didn't tell you because I knew this is the exact reaction I would get. I'll see you Saturday! Are you okay? Where are we? New Mexico, couple miles from Albuquerque. Aren't you tired? Shouldn't we pull over? We will, few more miles before we can stop. You know, I think it's really great how much passion you have for you kids. I don't mean to pry on your situation or anything. It's just, most guys I know only think about themselves. It's always refreshing to see. Well my kids are my everything. I don't know how to be away from them, I guess I'm still learning how to adjust. I can only imagine. I hope you have to never find out what this feels like. Yeah, me neither. But it's an admirable trait, captain. Okay, I'm gonna go back to sleep. Promise you'll pull over before you run us off the road. I promise. Are we all checked out? Yup! You're in a great mood. I feel refreshed. Everybody in the car, LA, here we come. Well, it looks like we're here. Hey, you okay? No. Yes, it just... I can't believe we're actually here. Believe it. And you'll do great, buddy. I'm shaking. I'm actually shaking. Is that normal or am I having a stroke here? I think you're just nervous. Yeah, you're probably right. Or it could be low blood sugar, I heard that shaking happens to people with low blood sugar. Got any candy on ya? No, I'm fresh out of candy. Well, maybe we should go to the store, you know? Just to be safe. Connor, you're gonna crush this. Come on, Connor, let's go show 'em what you got. We didn't drive all this way to go back now. You're right, you're right. Okay. Alright, let's go show 'em what we got. Knock 'em dead, buddy. You're not comin'? I can't. I have to do what I came to do. I need you in there, man. You don't need me. You're gonna nail this, Connor. Getting there is half the battle and look where you're at. You're here. Just trust in yourself. Captain to co captain. Co captain. You got this. Thanks, captain. I'll see you guys back at the hotel. Alright. Good luck! - You checked in? - Yes. Checked in? You're checked in? Cool. You guys here for the auditions? No, I'm here to rob a bank, what, that piano give me away? I am so sorry. I have rude, not funny verbal spillage going on. - Connor, stop talking. Yes. Yes, we are here for the audition. Great. Take this waver, fill it out to check in. Then wait behind these folks to be called, alright? Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Let's go. ¶ Oh, this retched old soul ¶ ¶ I'm too young and naive ¶ ¶ to be feelin' this worn down and old. ¶ ¶ I think about her. ¶ ¶ When the... ¶ Hey. No, no, I don't see ya. Oh, there you are. Hey. How are ya, man? Good to see you, how was the drive? Ah, it wasn't bad. Good, good. Gosh, these houses, people live like this? Yeah, I know, can you believe it? We're actually prepping this one for an open hose this weekend. You wanna guess what's it's goin' for? No idea. $4.5 million. Jesus. I know. It's owned by some drummer in some band, the Cross Scheme Tremors? Travers, Cross Cave Travers. Yeah, that's the one. No kidding, that's a big band. Hm, never heard of them. Check out this view. Wow. Doesn't get any better than this. Wow. Well, no, no, no, I take that back. Technically it does get better, two weeks after closing. Two words, bro. Commission check. There's literally nothing better than that. Doin' good, Brad. Livin' the dream. Not too late for you to hop on, now that the old ball and chain's been cut. I mean, not that I'm saying Catherine's, you know, old or whatever. I just... I don't know, sometimes I get a little sad whenever I think about your life. Sad? Well, you married your high school sweetheart, you had two kids before you were 30. You never got to explore what's out there. But now, you can. Welcome to freedom. Is that what this feeling is? Freedom? Yeah, and you should embrace it. I mean, why live the life of a one girl, old school country man, when you can live like a king? I'm talkin' models, everywhere. And they let you do whatever you want. Eh, okay. Where's Dad? He's in the car. What, here? Yeah. What are you doing? Dad. Calm down, I cracked the windows. Dad! Dad! Ugh, thank you. Open the car, jack ass. Relax, he's fine. Dad? What is he even doing here? What happened to his house nurse? Oh, she quit this morning. She quit? It's hard to find good help these days. What are you talking about, man, she looked after him for almost two years. What did you do? Nothin'. Bradford, what did you do? Okay. I may have slept with her daughter. Disgusting, you know that. Well, you know, she always liked me. I didn't think she'd mind. I can't even look at you right now, man. Just livin' the dream, man. Is that what this is? The dream is living like the biggest prick in life? A money hungry, womanizing, dirt bag, who can't treat his father, the man that raised us, with just a little bit of human decency? Is that the dream that you're talkin' about? Okay, I think you need to calm down. No, I'm not gonna calm down. You lived your entire life like the world revolves around it. And it was slightly cute when you were a kid, but you're an adult now, it's pitiful. You need to start acting like one. Water. Yeah, I'm sorry Dad, we'll get you one in a second. Feel better, getting all that out? You're such a son of a bitch, Steve. You think you always know best. It's your way or the highway. Well, guess what? I picked the highway, and look at us. No, no, no, look at me. Rich, fit, good looking. And look at yourself, jobless, bearded, and divorced. I gotta say, I think I'm winning. Dad, whoa. Dad, are you okay? Dad? Is he okay? Yes, he's fine. Just a little bit dehydrated. You're very lucky that he wasn't hurt during the fall. You have to be more careful. I will, thank you. It says here that he was diagnosed with early stages of dementia, a couple months ago. Is there a problem? No, it's just that talking with him, he seemed to really be not there. Dementia affects people at different rates. But it was just so quick. Yeah, none of us really saw it coming. You can go in and see him if you'd like. Okay. Hey, Sarah. Yeah? Thank you for coming to LA with me. If I were here by myself, I probably woulda skipped out by now, so... I know we bicker sometimes but I'm really glad you suggested I come along. I hate to admit it, but you were right. This has been an amazing adventure and I definitely needed it. 20-84. 20-84? Come on in. Go get 'em. Come on in. Don't worry, I won't press charges. Now who's the good looking one? Where's you learn to throw a punch like that? The Steve I know couldn't throw a punch to save his life, now would he. I honestly don't know. I think I just hit my limit. I never really expected my life to turn out like this. It just wasn't part of my plan. It's understandable. Wanna go in? No, no, I can't. I'm actually late for a date. Do you mind saying goodbye for me? Seriously? Can't keep the ladies waiting, bro. Thanks. 20-85. I can't believe I didn't get it. At least you put yourself out there. I guess, but I failed. No, you didn't. This is a stupid TV show more that it is a talent show. They're looking for specifics that appeal to their target audience to raise their ratings. Like, aesthetically pleasing people. That doesn't make me feel better. Okay, that's not what I'm trying to say. I just mean, this is one rejection. There can be many more for whatever reason. Kudos for putting yourself out there. Thank you. That alone, puts you above millions of others. Thanks. 20-87. Hey. Dude, I heard you playin' through the door, you're like amazing, you're really good. Thanks, man. Here, take my card. I'm Cody, I'm a guitar player, originally from Minnesota. I don't know what your next move is, man, but I really like the way you play the keys. Thanks man. Yeah. I'm Connor. That's my sister, Sarah. Cool. What are you guys doing later? We're having a little get together at our place, maybe you wanna stop by? Food, booze, nothin' too extreme, you know. Yeah, man, maybe. My number's on the card, just text me for details, networking. I'm told that's how this city works. Yeah, man. Alright. Cool. Cool, see you tonight? - Yeah, for sure. - Alright. Later, Sarah. Can you believe it? Hey. What are you doing here? Did your date throw herself down the stairs at the sight of you? I just came back to see how he was. And I guess I felt a little bad about leaving. He's fine. And I wanted to talk to you. Then talk. I just wanted to say, thank you, for picking him up and taking him with you. It's what any normal son would do. Or should do. I know. You've always been the one to step up whenever responsibilities struck. And we know sometimes I am not. Look... The way I see it, you've got two beautiful kids you've managed to keep alive, for what, three years now? Six and nine. No. Wow. It's been that long. Jeez. Well, tell 'em Uncle Brad said, what's up? But in all honesty, I can't even keep a fish alive for more than a few days. It's true. I had a pet fish, no name. I got him because I heard women like it whenever you have a pet. Shows a compassionate side or somethin' like that. Anyway, I kept forgetting that he was in the corner. It's not like they make any noise or give you any reason to remember them. Therefore, his presence is easily forgotten. Dad's kinda become the fish. What? He doesn't say much and whenever he does, it doesn't make any sense. Let me get this straight. You just compared our father to a fish that sits in solitude and swims around in its own crap? Well, look at him, am I wrong? You are seriously disturbed. Ah, but not wrong. Bradford. I don't know what went wrong with you, but I have to tell you this now because I don't know when I'm gonna see you again. Frankly, I don't care. But you don't deserve a father like ours. Hey... He's the best man I've ever known and he loved being a dad to us. He didn't raise you to become this selfish, narcissistic, disgrace that you turned out to be. Steve. I don't know what's happenin' for you right now. Just go, man, I got it from here. Okay. Bye Pop. Bye Steve. Bye. You should go out tonight. Take in the city. Have yourself an adventure, Dad will still be here in the morning, I promise. Oh yeah, hey babe, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Yeah, I got stuck in traffic. Hey. Hey, good to see you. Let's get you a drink. I'm okay. I was gonna stay and I don't know. it's just... Really isn't my style anymore. Oh, come on, one drink. You don't wanna have a little bit of fun? You forget I grew up in the Boondocks. This, with beer pong and booze was every summer night for me. Okay, I'll accept that. Come on, you have to at least stay for on of Connor's songs. Yeah. They've been practicing ever since auditions. I think Connor found himself a new band. Wow, that's move's quickly. Yup. Thank you for coming to our house party tonight. Today, we auditioned for the show, Million Dollar Entertainer. Maybe some of you guys have heard of it. Who knew my brother would be so good at networking? Sometimes people surprise you. Well, we didn't make it, unfortunately. However, as a firm believer that everything happens for a reason, we met the most amazing keyboard player. So please welcome, to our jam session, all the way from Wisconsin, Connor Martin! It's Dad, it's Dad. Hey, sweetheart. Hi, Daddy. Hi Dad. What's up, buddy? How's soccer going? I heard you made the championship. Yes. Oh, man, I'm so proud of you. Dad, are you going to be there. Oh yeah. I'll be there. I'll pick you up on Saturday. Hey, can I talk to your mom for a second, please? Hold on. Love you, bud. No, Logan, I don't need to talk to him. Oh, no, no, Logan, your mom, not Grandma. Logan, please, no. Steve... Miriam. So, where's Catherine? She's out, dinner with a friend. So I get the kiddos for the evening. I hope they're behaving. Of course, they're good kids. Please tell Catherine I called. I will. Could I talk to the kids one more time real quick? Aw, look how late it is. Grandma's lettin' you stay up past your bedtime. You better not get used to it. You be good for her, okay? I'll see you soon. Bye Daddy, love you. Bye, I love you. Bye... Hi. Hey. Why aren't you sleeping? I couldn't sleep. Are you okay? Yeah, I was just wondering if I could come in and chat for a bit? Oh. Okay. Connor's sleeping. Right. We all have a really early morning. We do. Should you be resting up? Right. Good night then. Wait. I guess we could chat for a little bit. Just not in here. Oh, that'd be great. Okay. Let me get my sweatshirt. Business administration and management. Yup. I just can't see you doin' that. Why is that? I don't know, I picture you as a librarian or a kindergarten teacher or something. Me? What made you choose that major? A boy. Wow, I did not see that coming. And my parents. I didn't know what I wanted to study at the time, and you gotta choose something. So that seemed like the satisfactory fit. I see. You know, I took a creative writing class once. I wrote a lotta pieces, but I never showed it to anybody. Just my teachers. Why not? Oof, I don't know. Guess it's personal reflection. I really loved it though. Almost changed my major. What was the holdback? There's no money in the arts. And I'm the successful child. The one that gets the good grades and goes to the good school, gets the steady job. 'Cause I'm probably going to be taking care of Connor. Because let's face it, he's not gonna grow up anytime soon. I don't feel like it's fair for you parents to put that kinda pressure on you. That's what's funny. They didn't. I put that expectation on myself. Why would you do that? I don't know. It's really funny to say this out loud. Um... It's just safer to color in the lines. And I was already too invested in business, that it would have been a complete waste of time and money. Well, I can speak from experience that that's where you're wrong. It's never too late to start over. Look at me, I'm a perfect example for that one. Whatever career I get when I go back home, I have no choice but for it to be new. Yeah, what are you gonna do? I have no idea. I spent so many years in routine, I think I forgot what I loved. Well, you have a long car ride home. Maybe the road will help you remember. We do have a long trip back, don't we? Oh... I'm not going back. I figured Connor would stay, but why aren't you going back? I have nothing to go back to. Of course you do. This could be the start to a great new friendship. Yeah? Yeah. And David, he'd love to see you, spend some time with you and stuff. Yeah, I guess. I'm just gonna make sure that Connor is okay first. You're a good sister. You're wise beyond your years, you know that? I think you should start writing again. yeah? Yeah. Perhaps you're right. We learn about ourselves through the stories of others. The ones that are courageous enough to share their experiences with us. Everything, from their flaws and failures. To their success and purpose in life. Interesting. Who knows, maybe one day I'll be telling a story about a unwanted cross-country adventure I took with a girl and her brother. And how it may have been the most life changing, eye opening adventure of my life. Now, that's a good story. And the best thing about it, is that it's true. Yeah, the best ones usually are. I think we've had a little too much wine. I think you're right. Come on, I'll walk you to your room. Another beautiful day in the city. You smell that, brotha? That is the smell of endless opportunity headed my way. Where's Sarah? I'm gonna get a soda, you want anything? No, I'm good, thanks. Hey, sorry I'm late. Hi. You okay? Yeah, are you okay? Yeah, it's just... After last night I just wanna make sure it wasn't weird between us. Steve, I enjoyed it. It was nice to have a real conversation. I'm cool if you're cool. I'm cool. Gonna hug it out? Yup. Check it out, it's Mountain Fresh. I haven't seen this stuff since 2004. What are you guys doin'? Get in here, buddy. We're having a little group hug. Ah. What a journey. Okay, my friends. It's time for me to get going. I'm sad to see you go, captain. Thank you for the ride. My pleasure. Good kid, Connor. Proud of you for pursuing your dreams. That means a lot. It's not too late for you to go with us. I know, and I appreciate it. But I'm gonna help Connor get an apartment and point him in the right direction of a grocery store. I get it. The two of you will be great at whatever you do. Thank you. Welcome. Hey, do you think David would mind watching Rox for a little bit longer? Ah, I'm sure he'll be fine with it. See ya later, kid. You all good, Pop? You comfy, Dad? Excited to get back to your roots? Taylor and Logan are gonna be happy to see you. Dad? Can you even understand me? Is this how we all end up? Is this what the end is like? Is this it? I quit my job, I got divorced by my wife, I lost my kids. I keep thinkin' it can't get any worse than this, but if this is the end... Shit. I'm nervous to go home, Dad. It's different. Catherine and I split up, and I guess for us, it was over a long time ago but... But my kids. I don't know how to lose them. I'm not losing the per se, I just... I feel like I'm getting demoted. You and Ma, you loved each other for life. You'd go in the office, and you'd work hard and then you'd come home and you'd work harder to be a husband and a father. For years I couldn't figure out how you did it. I think I know now. You loved it. The job, the family. You made us your world because it brought you happiness. That's what I can't figure out, Dad, I don't know what brings me happiness anymore. I know it's being a father, but now that I'm a part time dad, I... It just hurts, Dad, I don't... I don't know what to do. You'll figure it out, son. What? Did you... Did you just respond to me? Yeah, I did. And I heard you. I am so confused right now, I thought you had... Dementia, yeah, I know. I made it up. I made it up. I made it up. It was the only way I could get you to rescue me from your brother's care. Why didn't you just call me? I... I would have come and picked you up. I know you would have, Steve, you're always a good kid. But I wasn't gonna take that risk, nope. So you faked dementia? Yeah. You're sick, Dad. I mean, I'm happy that you're okay right now, but you're sick. Ah, maybe a little but I'm really happy with this situation, you and I. I mean, this is great. Oh, well that's comforting. I'll ignore your sarcasm, sonny boy. But let me answer some of your questions, here. You and Catherine, I always liked her, sorry to see her go, but people grow apart, they grow together. That's the way it is. It's not a bad thing, it's just the way life is. But you and Mom never grew apart. That's different. She was one of a kind, she was an angel. And this part time dad thing... You're a full time dad. Not when the court is involved. No, you listen to me, son. You have to take advantage of every minute. So you have a limited time to be with them? So you make sure you're fully there, every second you're with 'em. You play with them, you talk to them, you teach them life lessons, you make memories that will last a lifetime. That's how you become a full time dad and a part time situation. That sorta makes sense. Of course it does. This job thing, I mean, don't sweat it. You should use this time to figure out what you really want to do. I mean, time off, it's a gift. Do not waste it. Thank you, Dad. Don't thank me, it's the truth. But you could do your old dad one favor. Name it. Remember those recipes you and your mom used to prepare for dinner? Yeah, I haven't made any of those since college. Yeah, and I haven't had 'em since she passed away. I need you to make me a real corned beef sandwich, the whole shebang with horseradish and everything. Let me tell you, that low-carb pudding at the hospital did not suffice. Daddy! Hey, princess. Muah, muah. You know, a friend arrived for you? For me? Yeah, what was his name? Hold on, it's gonna come to me. Uh, oh yeah, it's the tickle monster. Daddy! Daddy, stop. What's wrong? I'm too old for the tickle monster. Too old for the tickle monster? How you guys doin'? It's good to see you. Good to see you too. You look incredible. Thank you. You remember Ben. Yeah, hey Ben, good to see you. Thanks for coming. Oh, are you kidding me? Thanks for having us, I'm so excited to see this place, it's looking great. Yeah, it's been a long road but it's finally here. Go one in, enjoy yourself. It's an open bar. Uh oh, look out. Yeah. You look great. Thanks, you too. Thanks. God, I'm really proud of you. You know, I didn't think that we were... I know, I know. Me too. Okay. Steve, can you talk to Logan, he's still adjusting. Yeah, I'll have a chat with him. Thank you. No problem. get in there and go enjoy yourself. Have fun. Good to see you, Steve. Hey, Miriam. Yeah, you look nice. Thank you, thank you for coming. Oh, of course. I appreciate the invite. Oh, get in there and have some fun. It's good to see you. It's good to see you. Hi Dad. Hey bud. You okay? Ben treating you nicely? You know bud, he's a part of you life now. It's okay to like Ben. Do you like Ben? I do like him. You wanna know why I like Ben? He's good to the people I love. You, Taylor, your mom. He doesn't play soccer with me. It's okay, I'll play soccer with you anytime you want. Does that sound good? Yeah, I love you Dad. I love you too, buddy. You hungry? Yup. Good, let's go get some grub. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to my friend, my business partner, and man responsible for the amazing honey ginger salmon that melts in your mouth, Mr. Steve Anderson. Thank you, guys. I just... Seeing all of you here, I can't tell you how much that means to David and I. I never thought my life would end up like this. Looking back, it's the unexpected occurrences in my life that now seem to be the most rewarding. I look around at all of you here, and I'm overwhelmed with an amount of gratitude. If I've learned anything from this whole experience, it's that life is forever changing, and it's never too late for a new start, to go chase a dream. And I wanna thank you guys for all being here, to watch the Honey Bee come to fruition. Without further ado, big surprise, all the way from LA, Wings on the Road. This is a new one. It's dedicated to my sister, Sarah. Chicago is gaining one hell of a writer next summer. Whoo! I've got blisters on my fingers. Ow! Ow! Take this thing back, will ya?
