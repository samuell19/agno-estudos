And then I gotta hit the road. - How long will you be gone? - Uh... About three days. Okay, now. Once upon a time, there was a girl who ate four milk chocolate bars, and got a very bad tummy ache. (lighthearted piano music) Now her parents took her to the hospital because she had bouts where she didn't feel good. And the doctor told her right in front of her mommy and daddy that the road to recovery was to not load up on the dock, I mean not to load up on dark chocolate or milk chocolate before dinner. (catchy music) Once upon a time... There was a boy with a finger on his head. All the other boys, they made fun of him because he was so different. They'd shove him, call him names. Girls made it hard for him too. They giggled when he'd walk by. All in all, the boy with the finger on his head didn't like being different. - [Owner] Shut it down, ya'll! - Hey, I said what the fuck were you doing in there? - [Boss] I said shut it down! - Man, we fucking heard you! This is a fucking joke! - Look, just let us finish our set in front of a crowd. - Why am I gonna stay open all night just for you? - There's nobody here yet, man. - If those kids wanted in, they'd pay the cover. - Those kids expected a free show, that's what we agreed. - Man, I'm running a business here. What am I gonna do with a bunch of little kids who don't drink and get in free? And don't forget you owe me for the sound. Marsalis paid for his sound. - What the fuck, man? Why don't you just fucking tell us to bring our own fucking PA, man? This is such bullshit, dude. Branford Marsalis? He wouldn't play on a stage with a fucking sinkhole in it. Your fucking club's a piece of shit, man. Yeah, you fucking want some? - Hey. Hey, hey! Hey, hey, look, look! Here's your guaranteed back.

Lost and fucked. - Close your mouth so you don't bite your tongue, this is gonna hurt. - So what's up with you and Ross? - What are you asking me? - I don't know. I just want to know what the band would be like if things were different. Ow!

It is now. - Damn, it's hot. (loud banging) Have you guys figure out what you're gonna do about this? - That's a good question, poop dick. Maybe we can carve S.O.S. in your back and you can stand like a billboard on the side of the road until you die or a car shows up. - Hey, you could try. Why don't you guys walk to town, and I'll just kick it here and watch the stuff. - I am so tired of you kickin' back. It's too hot for you? Oh, I'm cool as a God damn cucumber. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You want us to walk somewhere and get help for you, Dave? Is that it? Huh? Is that it? Well it doesn't work that way, you stupid son of a bitch. - Ross, Ross! - Stay away from me, stay away from me. Look man, fuck you man. Don't even look at me the rest of the God damn tour, or I'll pour salt in your fucking wounds so quick you won't know what hit you. - I'm looking at you. - Chill the fuck out, Ross. Chill out! - [Joy] Guys, guys! - [Brendan] Chill out, Ross! - Why can't you be part of the fucking solution for once, man huh? - Yeah, like it's my fault Brendan didn't get the fucking radiator fixed. - Oh, you shut your fucking dick, man, I was just defending you. - Oh, whatever man. - You know what, fuck you. - You guys, you guys, stop it! Look, look! (catchy music) - Name's Pat, what can I do for you? - I'm having a problem with my van. - Yeah? If you can get your little lady here to pop the hood, I'll take a little look at it. (catchy music) Popped like a whore, didn't she? (chuckling) - [Ross] I wouldn't know. - You niggers never did know nothing about no cars, now did you? - No, these days we're into golf. (laughing) - You're alright. He's alright. (catchy music) Well, that'll do her. You ever been towed before? - Uh, no. Is there a trick to it? (chuckling) - You know what, on second thought, I'll let you drive my van, I'll drive this here van. - Okay, where are we going? - Well, we're going up one exit, and then there's a garage on the left. And it's not open, seeing how it's the Lord's Day and all, but I do know the owner, and I say he'll fix you up right good. (chuckling) Hell, tow's even free. - Well, what's the catch? - Just one, little lady. You gotta ride with me. - No way. This was a bad idea. (chuckling) - This guy's a fucking pig, man. - I'm not complaining, at least he was nice enough to help us out. - You know, you'd be helping me out a lot. My boss, he's got this daughter, I'm kinda sweet on her, so... You know, I've been bringing him customers and stuff, to make him like me, but, I don't know.

(bottle spraying) - [Ward] They'd shove him. The boy with a finger on his head. Girls would make fun of him too. Once upon a time... Cause he's so different. Suddenly, he had a great idea. He liked being different. Maybe, if everyone at the game had an extra finger, they wouldn't feel so alone. And neither would he. (drowned out music) - Grr! (laughing) Aw. What's wrong? Oh, don't you like me? - Yeah, I like you just fine, could I just please have the photo? (laughing) - You kiddin'? You have to put your hands down my panties to get that back.

I know it was your butt in that there lettuce. - I swear it'll never happen again. - And Cheree says you've been stealing her things. - No, I ain't! - [Lacy] Hey, ba, ba, hey, hey! - Nah uh! - [Lacy] Is that true? - I ain't been stealing. I'm not stealing nothing. - Aight, aight. Now. (fly buzzing) You say you ain't been stealing her things, I for one, believe you. - Great. But we don't want you smoking in the cafe no more, eh? - No smoking. - Oh, yeah. One more thing, son. Now... I ain't the fanciest man alive. - That's right. - But... You ain't gonna see me picking my nose, or popping my zits around the customers. - You ain't gonna fire me, are you Len? I mean, just... I ain't got no family except ya'll, I mean... I've been working here for barely nothing, I ain't got no real roof over my head, no friends except ya'll. I mean, I ain't complaining, cause I gotta be happy for what I got. But... If you can me, I'm gonna be gone. - No, son. I ain't gonna fire you. - No, we're not gonna fire you. - Rack em' up, boy. (catchy music) - Oh my God, look who's here! I never thought I'd see you again. What the hell are you doing? - Oh. (laughing) Hey, hey, hey, Leanne. - Hey. (laughing) So what's going on? - I'm just, you know, actually, I was just waiting for the bill here. - What you doing after the show? - Well, I think I just oughta be out about getting on home. You know, I've got a wife and daughter there. - What? - Uh huh. - And you don't wear a wedding ring? - Oh, that, well... You see, I'm allergic to gold, and I start breaking out, and it's pretty disgusting. - Oh hell, it's just my luck. I finally get you by myself, and you're married. - Yeah, for better or worse. - Well. You know, I think you're very, very lucky. Yeah. Because I absolutely hate being alone. - Uh huh. - Yeah. So, the least you could do is come and have tea with me at my place, right? - Oh... No, I gotta be getting on to... Well, the Stay Aspell Motel. - The Stay Aspell Motel. I know exactly where that is. They got a restaurant, I'll buy the tea. - No, no, no. - Come on baby, follow me! (laughing) - Leanne! - How long you been a musician? - Since kindergarten. - Hurry up! (chuckling) So it's your passion. - Yeah. - You know, I can be very passionate too. (chuckling) - You know, I should really go check on the van. - Oh, you're not gonna get away that easy. - Cheree, Cheree, Cheree. - Come on! - I have-- - [Cheree] Come on, I wanna take you to the pond! - Listen, I don't have time to go to the pond. - That? That's my twin brother, Lee. I never met him though. - Where is he? - He's on his way right now, coming here. - I don't understand. - Oh... That. Him being my brother and all, oh shit, that's a long story, you wanna hear? Okay, here we go. Turns out, I mean, I never met my mother. I never met my father either. You see, she was raped. During childbirth she died. And Lee went to foster care, and I was raised by my grandmama. But the family that adopted Lee, they moved from here to Texas. So that's why I never met him. - So how'd you find him? - Well, there's this... Well, it was a regular at the club. And he was a cop, and he used to come in all the time, turns in he used to work in Texas, and he picked up Lee a lot for soliciting. (laughing) Figures, right? Shit. Anyway... First time he comes in our club, he looks up on that stage and he thinks that it's Lee gone transvestite. (laughing) Boy was he wrong, right? Anyway, we became pretty good friends, and he tracked Lee's parole officer down, found him for me. What's that? - I have a chemical imbalance in my brain, and this helps me control it. You want one? - Oh. No, I'm way too hard on my body to let it go all to hell from some God knows what unknown side effects, right? Thanks. - You know... We have something in common. We... We both have questions about our family tree. - You mean like, you don't know your parents either? - No, no, I don't know who the father of my daughter is. - Oh wow, that sucks. I'm sorry. - No, no, no, it wasn't my wife's fault. You see, the medication that I'm on, sometimes it interferes with my ability to... You know. - Right, yeah, oh wow. I mean, that explains a lot. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So... My wife and I, well, we weren't getting pregnant, so we went to a fertility clinic. And after about a month or so, well, she just got right off pregnant, and she got pregnant with our daughter, Julie. - That doesn't sound too bad, what's wrong with that? - Well you see, the doctor, he lost his license for impregnating women with his own semen, and my wife and I weren't exactly intimate on a regular basis. - Wow, well. You can get one of those tests. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. My wife, she wanted to keep this baby because her chances of getting pregnant were pretty slim, so. And she likes to tell me that, you know, Julie looks exactly like me, but it's the wondering, it just kills me sometimes. - I'm sorry. Do you have a picture of her? Because I'm good at this. - Yeah. That's Julie right there. - Let me see. (chuckling) Okay. Oh my God. You are crazy. You're crazy. She looks just like you. - You think? - I think so? I know so. - Yeah. (laughing) Well, she saves my life every time I'm ina strange place. She just calms me down. I even... I write stories for her when I'm on the road. - Wow. That's really good, that's sweet. You're really lucky, you know. Having a family of your own and everything, beautiful daughter. I pray someday that I could meet some man to just take me out of this damn town and have a family of my own. - Could you... Just excuse me a minute, I'll just be right back, okay? (drowned out jazz music) Hey. Yeah, hey. I had a few minutes so I thought I'd give you a ca... What? No, what? I'm sure she didn't mean anything... Now just... You let me come home before you do anything. Now you tell Julie I'm coming home too, okay? I'm coming home now. - What happened? - I gotta go. Um... I really like you. I had a good... Conversation with you. (bell ringing) - Come on, say it. I was born on a pirate ship. - I was born on a pile of shit. (laughing) Yeah. Alright. - Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I hurt your little old feelings? (laughing) - You better behave yourself, or I'm gonna have to throw you in the pond. (gasps) - You wouldn't feed me to the gator, would you? - Is there really a gator in there? - My father didn't lose his fingers picking his nose. - Seriously? - Sure, my dad's been after that gator for years. Good thing, too. Last week it ate an entire school bus full of kids. And the driver too. - Oh my God, I can't believe we've been gator bait for the last three hours, and you haven't even told me. (laughing) - Sit down. Silly. Go on. - That's right, so you gotta get a tall beer. - Alright. - He sure does love that boy. (laughing) Loves him more than his own daughter. - Well, father son, you know? - Yeah. Me and Len's cousins. - Really? - Yeah. He always wanted a son, but I told him he should be thankful that our daughter Cheree didn't turn out with two heads, do you know what I mean? - Does Cheree know? - Ugh, it's a small town. (chuckling) Everybody knows. There's no way she's gonna take after me and marry a Hereabouts boy, nope. Hell, Pat's probably a cousin. I pray everyday that some new blood will come to Hereabouts and take my Cheree to a big city. I prayed in church today. Kicked us out when Len and I got married. - Aw, well you guys got each other, that's what matters. - Yeah. My prayers were answered when you and them three fellas showed up. Hell, where's that little tiny one with the alphabet on his chest? (chuckling) - You know, he has been gone a while. - Yeah, you go find him. - Okay. - Jesus, Dave. How unoriginal is this? Big rock and roller can't find enough of an identity in his music, so he has to go and OD? I mean, come on. - Yeah, I thought I moved out of my parents house a long time ago. - Hey, I don't give a shit what you do. I just think if these people are nice enough to let us into their house, maybe we shouldn't vandalize their property. What's so great about crack? - It's fucking meth. - Sorry. No really, what's it like? - Well... If you feel any better, it's a good, hard fuck. - Well then I guess I'm not missing out on anything. - Hey ya'll. Supper's almost ready. Little lady. Would you be so kind as to excuse us for just a stick? Thank you, darling. Now you listen up, you little punk. For some stinkin' reason, I almost like you. Now you are gonna knock that damn chip off your shoulder, and start behaving like a gentleman, so's I can keep on liking you. Else wise, I'm gonna get my gun, I'm gonna shoot your nuts off. Are your ears working, boy? - Yeah. - Aight. Now, like I was saying, supper's almost ready. Now wouldn't it be nice if you would clean up a little bit in here? And then go fetch my little girl Cheree, and your little friend... - Brendan. - [Joy] Hey Lacy. - Hey honey. - How are you? - I'm fine, let's put something in ya before you disappear. - Hey. What is that? - Oh, the greens! - There you go. - Can I? - I don't believe I've ever eaten a green before. - Make yourself at home. - What's it taste like? - Um, well it's hard to describe the taste of a green. They taste like... Greens. - Thanks, Ross. - [Brendan] Have you actually ever seen the gator? - [Cheree] No. But I know he's here, cause I feel him watching me. (loud scream) - Oh shit, oh shit! Oh my God! - Cheree? Cheree! - Hang on, I'll save ya! - [Len] The hell you will, that's my baby girl! - Get me a gun, let's go. Sweetie, we're coming! (loud screaming) - [Brendan] Oh, God. Jesus Christ! - Mama's coming, little buttercup! - Hang on, babygirl! (loud screaming) - What the fuck is going on? - There's a fucking gator! (loud screaming) - Oh shit! (loud screaming) (gun fires) - Yeah, hot damn! - Did you hit? (loud screaming) - That's disgusting. - No, no, no. It's the food chain. - It's a whole fuckload better than being that fucking gator's dinner. (laughing) - Does it taste like chicken? - Oh, not at all. But hey, I had no idea that something so ugly could taste so good. - Eat up, Brendan. It's an aphrodisiac, you know. - Hey man, now that the gator's gone, what we gonna shoot next? - Somebody needs to own the gator from the pond, how is it? (clears throat) - Hey, um, you know I was wondering... Is there any way that we can pay you back for the repairs once we get to New Orleans? - Oh, hell, son. I know what it's like to be in a pinch. Tell you what. Let's exchange goods and services for goods and services, eh? Play us some of that there music of yours, and we'll call it even. Aight? - Yeah, aight. (laughing) Cool, thanks. Cool. - We're gonna kick some gator ass. - You the man. - You know what I'm saying? You know what? Do gators have asses? - [Ward] The boy with the finger on his head went home and sewed a very big finger out of cloth and stuffing, and he painted the school colors on the finger, and he showed it to his teacher, and he held it up high, and he yelled we're number one! (uptempo banjo music) (catchy music) - Is it true that alligator meat's an aphrodisiac? - It must be. (catchy music) There's no good time for me to say this. So I'm just gonna say it now. - What, this is your last tour? - Yeah. - Oh, come on Ross, don't do this. - No, look. It's been an eight year struggle, and I'm over it. - Look, you're using Dave as some kind of an excuse, okay? - Maybe. These are excuses I needed. - This band is my whole life, and I'm in it for the long haul. If you quit the band, you quit me. (catchy music) Ross. Ross! - [Mom] So what have you been doing with Julie behind my back? - [Ward] What are you talking about? - [Mom] She's only nine! You never even look at me. - [Ward] What? - [Mom] You're sicker than I thought! - [Ward] Will you be quiet? I don't think we should be talking so loud. - [Mom] Quit avoiding the issue! - [Ward] Paula, just wait! Damn it. (catchy music) - [Cheree] I'll be right back, Brendan. Don't you go nowhere! (catchy music) - [Brendan] Sheree? Sheree? - Hi, lover. (chuckles) - Sheree. Sheree. (chuckling) Sheree, look, Sheree. Alright, look, after all the fun we've had today, what, with almost getting killed and everything, I'm still not ready or willing to be your first. - But... Aren't I a sexy virgin? You're not even a little bit interested. - No. You know, I'm fucked enough without fucking you. I haven't slept in two days, my singer's burning out, I have to be at a show tomorrow night, and my van's broken. I'm confused and tired, and oh my God. And mostly, I'm confused. It's weird. You're like a magnet. But it's not sex. I genuinely like you. - If I promise not to try anything, can we still share my bed? - Hi daddy. - Sweetie, what are you doing up? - I don't know. - Did you hear me and Mommy? - Yeah. - Scare you? - Yeah. Why do you fight? - I don't... Grownups just do that sometimes, so now you just go on to sleep, okay? - [Julie] Daddy? - Yeah, Monkey? - I'm not tired. Will you tell me a story? - Oh, honey. I'm really tired, and I gotta go take a shower. - You have to hit the road. Right? - Right. Am I hitting the road too much? - Maybe. - You can tell me if I am. - Yes. A story? - Okay. Just one though. And then you gotta get on to sleep, okay? So, let's see. Scoot over, sweetie. Uh... Okay. - Is this the one about the girl with the oatmeal in her nose? - No, sweetie. It's a different one. (acoustic guitar music) (birds chirping) (bass music) - Morning. - Morning. - So ya'll ready for your big trip? - Yeah. Um, listen-- - Ah, ah, ah. She's already fixed. (catchy music) - Cheree? - Thank you so much for your hospitality. - You're welcome. It's gonna be quiet around here without you folks. - [Joy] Yeah, we'll miss you. - Well, son. You ever get your little runt self back here to... - Bumfuck? - Bumfuck. (laughing) You be sure and give us a holler. - Fuck yeah, Len. - Aight. - Thanks for everything. - You bet. - Oh dear, huh. Ah, a little sugar right here. - Thanks, Lacy. See you lady. - Alright, honey. - Well, I couldn't find Cheree, so maybe you guys can say goodbye to her for me. - Yeah. - What's wrong? - I just wanted you to take Cheree with. She just wants to see the world. You know. - Well, maybe next time we're in Hereabouts, we can look her up. - Okay. Come on, give me a hug. Take care of yourself now. - We'll see you son. - Guys, I really appreciate everything you've done for us. Everything. - Put it there, son. - Alright ya'll, take care of yourself now. - Hello? Lee? Hey. Oh my God. Where are you? Oh my God, you're so close. Well, what time you get here? I mean, what time does your bus get here? Okay, alright, well don't hitch with any weirdos, okay? Alright, see ya. Bye. (dial tone beeps) - We are finally on our way out of Alabama. Hey, what do you think of that, Dave? - I told you the south was cool. - No you didn't. You hated it just as much as the rest of us. - Whatever. - What were you saying, the Poison Cornbread Tour and shit? Hey, am I right? Hey Brendan. What, you in love, Dude? - Huh? - I said are you thinking about that teenage pussy? - Dave, you're the fucking limit! - Hey, hey, hap, da. Now kids. Don't make me turn this thing around, cause I will, and we'll be stuck in Alabama forever. - Cheree! (pail clanging) Where the hell is she? Damn it. Cheree! Ai yee! (somber string music) Well, where the hell is Cheree? - Well... Maybe she took one of them chunkers out for a drive. - Pat probably pissed her off again. - Hope she makes it home in time for the lunch rush. - What lunch rush? - What you thinking? - I was thinking, I want to go to New Orleans someday too. - What's wrong? Don't you like it here at home? - I like it fine. - Ready? - Get set. Go! (laughing) Get off of me! - Come on baby. Come on, give me some of that good good! (laughing) (scared yelp) - Hi Daddy. - Oh, sweetie. I guess I fell asleep telling you a story. Okay, so. Okay, where were we? Oh, the boy with the finger on his head. - Uh, Daddy? - What? - Mommy has some tapes. - What tapes? - You know, Mommy's tapes. - Monkey, those... Those kinda things are just for grownups. They're not for kids. You understand? - Like cigarettes. - Yeah. Now I know where you got it. - How do you think it looks? - How does it look to you? - Look, I don't care what you and Joy think, man. Cheree's definitely not a virgin. What? She's a total slut, dude. It's written all over the bathroom. - Wow, Dave, I didn't know you could read. - Oh, well gee whiz, Branden. I didn't know you liked girls over the age of 12. (laughing) - [Joy] You guys. - Piece of shit. - Fuck you, man. Where's my guitar? - Oh shit. Don't tell me you left it in Whereabouts. - Hell no. It's probably just behind my amp here. What the fuck, why is this thing so fucking heavy? - Maybe because you shrank again. - Eh! - Hi, ya'll! - [Joy] Oh my God, Cheree. What are you doing here? - [Branden] Cheree. - Woo! (chuckles) - Where's my amp insides? - Are you okay? - Hey, where's the rest of my fucking amp? - I'm sorry! But I had to leave home. - Cheree, you could've just asked us. We would've made you a roadie or something. - No, we wouldn't have. And if you think we're taking her with us now, you're out of your fucking mind, dude. - Yeah, Cheree. I'm pretty sure it's kidnapping to take a minor across state lines without parental consent. - Yeah. So let's leave her the fuck here. - Hey, hey, look. Let's just call Lacy. - Ross has a point, I think your mom would like to know. (birds chirping) You can just tell Len that this is her chance to see the world, and we'll send her back on a bus as soon as we get paid. Yeah. Okay, bye. You got cool parents. (excited cheering) (laughing) - [Cheree] Come on! (laughing) - [Dave] All the amps to wreck, why'd you pick mine? - [Cheree] Yours was the biggest. - [Dave] Oh, you like that, do ya? (chuckling) - Alabama! Yeah, hello. What? Aw, shit. (acoustic guitar music) Yo. Oh, sorry. I was just checking if you were alright. - Hereabouts? You going to Hereabouts? - Fuck, if I can, yeah. - My home's in Hereabouts. Get in. - Cool. (acoustic guitar music) - Listen, asshole. If you so much as look at me again, I'll kick your fucking ass! - Dude. I like her. Hey, what's up? Right. - Man, I love the south. - Hey, I heard the desert southwest is kinda nice too. - And the pacific northwest? - Home's not bad either. - Oh, can I go? - Rare form tonight, people. Ready to rock? Yeah, woo! (excited yelling) (laughing) - Oh my God, look at you! Oh my good, look at this. My twin. Give me some love, give me some love. (laughing) Oh my God! (laughing) - Well... That teacher thought it was such a good idea that she told that boy just to go on home and make a bunch more of those crazy old fingers. Pretty soon, just about everybody had one of those for their favorite team. Just about everybody loved that boy with the finger on his head, because he was a little bit different. Instead of being a freak, he was a hero. The end.
