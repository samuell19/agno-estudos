Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say? All right. Come along with me. This here's Cherry Tree Lane. Nice little spot, you might say. Number 17's just down a bit. Now, this imposing edifice what first greets the eye is the home of Admiral Boom, late of His Majesty's Navy. Likes his house shipshape, he does, shipshape and Bristol fashion at all times. (whistle) - Time gun ready? - Ready and charged, sir. - Three minutes and six seconds. - Aye aye, sir. What he's famous for is punctuality. The whole world takes its time from Greenwich. But Greenwich, they say, takes its time from Admiral Boom. What cheer, Admiral? Good afternoon to you, young man. Where are you bound? Number 17. Got some parties here in tow what wants to see it. - Enter that in the log. - (man) Aye aye, sir. A word of advice, young man: Storm signals are up at Number 17. Bit of heavy weather brewing there. Thank you, sir. Keep an eye skinned. Here we are. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane. Residence of George Banks, Esquire. - Hello, hello, hello. The Admiral's right. - (shouting from house) Heavy weather brewin' at Number 17, and no mistake. - (woman) Leave her alone! - (woman #2) Shut up! (woman) I'll show you. Don't you be trying to stop the wretched creature! Let her go, that's what I say, and good riddance! I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door. But who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house? Me, that's who! Her and her high and mighty ways! And that face of her that would stop a coal barge, it would. Indeed, Mrs Brill! I wouldn't stay in this house another minute, not if you heaped me with all the jewels in Christendom. - No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go! - Stand away from that door, my girl! But what am I going to tell the master about the children? It's no concern of mine. Those little beasts have run away from me for the last time. They must be somewhere. Did you look around the zoo in the park? You know how Jane and Michael is. Coo! You don't think the lion could've got at them, do ya? You know how fond they was of hangin' around the cage. I've said my say, and that's all I'll say. I've done with this house forever. Well, hip, hip, hooray! And don't stumble on the way out, dearie. - Now, now, Katie Nanna! - (woman singing) Mrs Banks! She's home! # Our daughters' daughters will adore us and we'll sing in grateful chorus # Well done, Sister Suffragette Good evening, Katie Nanna, Ellen. We had the most glorious meeting! Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself to the wheel of the prime minister's carriage. - You should've been there. - Mrs Banks, I would like a word with you. And Mrs Ainslie, she was carried off to prison, singing and scattering pamphlets all the way! I'm glad you're home, madam. I've always given the best that's in me... Oh, thank you, Katie Nanna.

What is it, Katie Nanna? Mrs Banks, I have something to say to you. Where are the children? The children, madam, to be precise, are not here. They've disappeared again. Katie Nanna, this is really too careless of you. Doesn't it make the third time this week? The fourth, madam. And I for one have had my fill of it. - I'm not one to speak ill of the children... - When do you expect them home? I really couldn't say. And now if you'd be good enough to compute my wages, I'll... Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna, you're not leaving? What will Mr Banks say? He's going to be cross enough as it is to come home and find the children missing. Ellen, put these things away. You know how the cause infuriates Mr Banks. Yes, ma'am. Katie Nanna, I beseech you. Please reconsider. Think of the children. Think of Mr Banks. He was just beginning to get used to you. Posts, everyone! Four, three, two, one... Fire! - Katie Nanna, I do beseech you... - My wages, if you please. - Bit early tonight, aren't you, Admiral? - Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual. How are things in the world of finance? Never better. Money's sound, credit rates are moving up, up, up, and the British pound is the admiration of the world. Good man. How do things look from where you stand? Bit chancy, I'd say. The wind's coming up and the glass is falling. - Don't like the look of it. - Good, good, good. Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't steering into a nasty piece of weather. Banks! Do you hear me? Hello, Katie Nanna. That must be heavy. Allow me. - (Katie Nanna) Huh! - What a very pretty hat. # I feel a surge of deep satisfaction # Much as a king astride his noble steed Thank you. # When I return from daily strife to hearth and wife # How pleasant is the life I lead - Dear, it's about the children... - Yes, yes, yes. # I run my home precisely on schedule # At 6.01, I march through my door # My slippers, sherry and pipe are due at 6.02 # Consistent is the life I lead - George, they're missing. - Splendid, splendid. # It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910 # King Edward's on the throne It's the Age of Men # I'm the lord of my castle The sovereign, the liege # I treat my subjects, servants, children, wife # With a firm but gentle hand Noblesse oblige # It's 6.03, and the heirs to my dominion # Are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed # And so I'll pat them on the head and send them off to bed # Ah, lordly is the life I lead - Winifred, where are the children? - They're not here, dear. What? Well, of course they're here! Where else would they be? - I don't know, George. - You don't know? Well, they're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere. Very well. I'll deal with this at once. Give me the police station. Quickly, please. I don't think we need bother the police, dear. The facts of the matter... Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts. One fact and one fact alone is crystal clear! Katie Nanna's faltered at her post. She's let the family down. And I shall bring her to book... Oh. She's left us, hasn't she? Yes, dear. Only just. - What? Uh, yes. George Banks here. Yes. - (door bell) 17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency. I should like you to send a policeman around immediately. The policeman's here, George! What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service. Thank you so much. Good night. Come in, Constable. Come in. Thank you, sir. While going about my duties on the other side of the park, I noted some valuables that had gone astray. I believe they're yours, sir. Valuables? Come along, now. Come along. - (Mrs Banks) Jane! Michael! - Winifred, please don't be emotional. Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today. Children, come here at once. - Well? - I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father. - You see, it was windy... - And the kite was too strong for us. In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite that ran away, not the children. Thank you, Constable. I think I can manage this. Actually, it wasn't a very good kite. We made it ourselves. - Perhaps if you helped us to make one... - Ah, that's the ticket, sir. Kites are skittish things. Why, only last week with me own youngsters... I'm very grateful to you, Constable, for returning the children. And I'm sure that if you go to the kitchen, Cook will find you a plate of something. Thank you, sir. I shall now return to my duties. Thank you, Constable. Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am. Good night, sir. "Cook will find you something..."! I'm awfully sorry about this, George. I'll expect you'll want to discuss it. I would indeed! Ellen, take Jane and Michael upstairs straight away. (Ellen) Yes, sir. I knew it. When all's said and done, who bears the brunt of everything around here? Me, that's who! They don't want an honest, hard-workin' girl around here. They need a ruddy zookeeper. I'm sorry, dear, but when I chose Katie Nanna I thought she would be firm with the children. She looked so solemn and cross. Winifred, never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint. I'll try to do better next time. Next time? My dear, you've engaged six nannies in the last four months! And they've all been unqualified disasters. I quite agree. Choosing a nanny for the children is an important and delicate task. It requires insight, balanced judgment and an ability to read character. Under the circumstances, I think it might be apropos to take it upon myself to select the next person. Oh, would you, George? The way to find a proper nanny is to go about it in a proper fashion. I shall put an advertisement in The Times. Take this down, please. - Yes, of course, dear. - Wanted. Uh, no, required. Nanny: Firm, respectable, no nonsense. # A British nanny must be a general # The future empire lies within her hands # And so the person that we need to mould the breed # Is a nanny who can give commands - Are you getting this, Winifred? - Oh, yes, dear. Every word. # A British bank is run with precision # A British home requires nothing less # Tradition, discipline and rules must be the tools # Without them: Disorder, catastrophe, anarchy # In short, you have a ghastly mess Splendid, George! Inspirational. The Times will be so pleased. - (Jane) Father? - Yes? We've discussed everything, and we're very sorry about what we did today. I should certainly think so. It was wrong to run away from Katie Nanna. It was indeed. And we do so want to get on with the new nanny. Very sensible. I shall be glad to have your help in the matter. We thought you would. That's why we wrote this advertisement. - Advertisement for what? - For the new nanny. - You wrote an advert... - George, I think we should listen. - You said you wanted our help. - But, but... Oh, very well. "Wanted: A nanny for two adorable children." Adorable - well, that's debatable, I must say. # If you want this choice position # Have a cheery disposition - Jane, I don't... - # Rosy cheeks, no warts - That's the part I put in. - # Play games, all sorts # You must be kind You must be witty # Very sweet and fairly pretty - Well, of all the ridic... - George, please! # Take us on outings Give us treats # Sing songs, bring sweets # Never be cross or cruel # Never give us castor oil or gruel # Love us as a son and daughter # And never smell of barley water I put that in too. # If you won't scold and dominate us # We will never give you cause to hate us # We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see # Put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea # Hurry, Nanny # Many thanks, Sincerely... # Jane and Michael Banks Thank you. Most interesting. And now I think we've had quite enough of this nonsense. Please return to the nursery. They were only trying to help. They're just children. I'm well aware they're just children, Winifred. I only congratulate myself that I decided to step in and take a hand. "Play games, sing songs, give treats." Ridiculous. There's no question in my mind whatsoever. Now is the time for action. Give me The Times, please. No, I do not know the number. (Mrs Banks) Oh, George, you're always so forceful. (Mr Banks) The Times? George Banks here. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. I wish to place an advertisement in your column. (whistle) - Time gun ready? - Ready and charged, sir. I'll take the report, Mr Binnacle. The wind has changed, sir. Seems to be comin' in from a new quarter. So it is. - Sir? - What is it? Bit of somethin' or other taking place off the port bow. (Admiral) Ghastly looking crew, I must say! Coo! There's a fair queue of nannies outside, sir. Shall I show 'em in? Ellen, I said eight o'clock, and eight o'clock it shall jolly well be. You see? 12 seconds to go. - Ten, nine, eight... - Posts! Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Ellen, it is now eight o'clock. Yes, sir. I have told you time and time again, Ellen, I dislike being hurried into things. I don't understand. They're not what we advertised for at all. (barks) Michael, look! - Perhaps it's a witch. - Of course not. Witches have brooms. It's her. It's the person. She's answered our advertisement. Rosy cheeks and everything. Ellen, you may now show them in, one at a time. Yes, sir. - You may come in one at a time. - Thank you. (Mary Poppins) You are the father of Jane and Michael Banks, are you not? I said, you are the father of Jane and Michael Banks? Well, well yes, of course. I mean... You brought your references, I presume. May I see them? Oh, I make it a point never to give references. A very old-fashioned idea, to my mind. Is that so? We'll have to see about that, then, won't we? Now then, the qualifications. Item one: "A cheery disposition." I am never cross. Item two: "Rosy cheeks." Obviously. Item three: "Play games, all sorts." Well, I'm sure the children will find my games extremely diverting. May I? This paper, where did you get it from? I thought I tore it up. Excuse me. Item four: "You must be kind." I am kind, but extremely firm. - Have you lost something? - Yes... That paper, you see. I thought that I... - You are George Banks, are you not? - What? And you did advertise for a nanny, did you not? - George Banks. - Very well, then. (quietly) I tore it up, turned it over, tore it up again and threw it in there. Yes. I beg your pardon, are you ill? I hope not. Now, about my wages. The reference here is very obscure. Very obscure. We must be very clear on that point, mustn't we? - Yes, we must indeed. - I shall require every second Tuesday off. Every Tuesday... On second thoughts, I believe a trial period would be wise. Hm. I'll give you one week. I'll know by then. I'll see the children now. Thank you. Close your mouth please, Michael. We are not a codfish. Well, don't stand there staring. Best foot forward. Spit spot! - George? - Argh! George, what on earth are you doing? I thought you were interviewing nannies. - I was, I was! - You mean you've selected one already? - Yes, it's done, it's all done. - Well, where is she? What? She's in the nursery, of course. I mean, I put her to work straight away. How clever of you! I would have muddled the whole thing. Tell me, is she everything that we'd hoped she'd be? Well, it all happened rather quickly. I mean, I... Will she be firm? Will she give commands? Will she mould our young breed? You know, Winifred, I think she will. I think she will. In that case, perhaps you'd better tell Ellen to dismiss the others. The others? Oh, yes. - Ellen? - Yes, sir? Tell the other applicants they may go. The position has been filled. - The others, sir? - Yes, the others. How many nannies does she think we need in this house? The position has been filled. I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy. It is rather like a bear pit, isn't it? - That's a funny sort of bag. - Carpet. - You mean to carry carpets in? - No. Made of. This is your room, and there's a lovely view of the park. Well, it's not exactly Buckingham Palace. Still, it's clean. Yes, I think it will be quite suitable. Just needs a touch here and there. Well, first things first. I always say, the place to hang a hat is on a hat stand. Oh! This will never do! I much prefer seeing all of my face at the same time. But there was nothing in it. Never judge things by their appearance. Even carpetbags. I'm sure I never do. A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Hm. A little more light, perhaps. We'd better keep an eye on this one. She's tricky. She's wonderful. Much better! Now, let me see. That's funny. I always carry it with me. It must be here somewhere. - What? - My tape measure. - What do you want it for? - I want to see how you two measure up. Well, that's the funniest thing I ever saw. I know it's down here somewhere. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Here it is. Good. Come along, then. Quickly. Head up, Michael. Don't slouch. Just as I thought. Extremely stubborn and suspicious. - I am not! - See for yourself. "Extremely stubborn and susp..." Suspicious. Now you, Jane. Mm. Rather inclined to giggle. Doesn't put things away. How about you? Very well. Hold this for me. As I expected. "Mary Poppins. Practically perfect in every way." Mary Poppins! Is that your name? It's lovely. Thank you. I've always liked it. - Now, shall we get on with it? - Get on with what? In your advertisement, did you not specifically request to play games? - Oh, yes! - Very well, then. Our first game is called Well Begun Is Half Done. I don't like the sound of that. Otherwise entitled, Let's Tidy Up the Nursery. I told you she was tricky. - Shall we begin? - It is a game, isn't it, Mary Poppins? Well, it depends on your point of view. You see, in every job that must be done there is an element of fun. You find the fun, and snap! The job's a game. # And every task you undertake becomes a piece of cake # A lark, a spree # It's very clear to see # That a spoonful of sugar # Helps the medicine go down # The medicine go down Medicine go down # Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down # In a most delightful way # A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest # While gathering his bits of twine and twig # Though quite intent in his pursuit He has a merry tune to toot # He knows a song will move the job along (robin whistles along with music) # For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down # The medicine go down Medicine go down # Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down # In a most delightful way (jack-in-the-box squeaks) (snap) # The honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb # Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro # Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip - # And hence... - # And hence... - # They find... - # They find... # Their task is not a grind # Ah ah-ah-ah-ah-ah Cheeky. Don't be all day about it, please. Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Well, that was very... Thank you, now... When you've quite finished! Thank you. That will be quite sufficient. Hats and coats, please. It's time for our outing in the park. I don't want an outing. I want to tidy up the nursery again. Enough is as good as a feast. Come along, please. Let me look at you. Well, you're not as well turned out as I'd like. Still, there's time. There's time. Spit spot! And off we go. # For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down # The medicine go down Medicine go down # Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down # In the most delightful way # Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo # I does what I likes And I likes... # What I do Hello, art lovers. # Today I'm a screever And as you can see # A screever's an artist... # Of highest degree # And it's all me own work from me own memory Well, not Royal Academy, I suppose.

Don't move. Don't move a muscle. Stay right where you are. I'd know that silhouette anywhere! Mary Poppins! It's nice to see you again, Bert. I expect you know Jane and Michael. Well, I've seen 'em here and about. Chasin' a kite last time, weren't it? Mary Poppins is taking us to the park. To the park? Not if I know Mary Poppins. Other nannies take children to the park. When you're with Mary Poppins, suddenly you're in places you've never dreamed of. And quick as you can say "Bob's your uncle," the most unusual things begin to happen. I'm sure I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. Well, mind, it's not my place to say, but what she's probably got in mind is a jolly holiday somewheres or other. Something along these lines, I shouldn't be surprised. Punting on the Thames. That's always good if you like an outing. Here we go. The circus. How about a lovely circus? Lions and tigers. World-famous artistes performing death-defyin' feats of dexterity and skill before your very eyes. Ta-da! Oh, that's lovely. If you please, I'd much rather go there. Beautiful, ain't it? A typical English countryside as done by a true and lovin' hand. Though you can't see it, there's a little country fair down that road and over the hill. I don't see any road. What? No road? Just wants a bit of somethin' here... and a bit of somethin' there. There. A country road suitable for travel and high adventure. Please, may we go, Mary Poppins? Please? Such a lovely place. Don't you think it's lovely, Mary Poppins? Now's the time, Mary Poppins. No one's lookin'. Please, Mary Poppins. Please! I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself, thank you. All right, I'll do it myself. - Do what? - Bit of magic. - A bit of magic? - It's easy. Let's see... You think. You wink. You do a double blink. You close your eyes and jump. Is something supposed to happen? Bert, what utter nonsense! (sighs) Why do you always complicate things that are really quite simple? Give my your hand, please, Michael. Don't slouch. One, two... Mary Poppins, you look beautiful. - Do you really think so? - Cross my heart you do. - Like the day I met ya. - You look fine too, Bert. I thought you said there was a fair. So I did. Down the road and behind the hill, remember? Come on! I hear the merry-go-round. - Tell 'em Bert sent ya. - Don't fall and smudge the drawing. # Ain't it a glorious day # Right as a mornin' in May # I feel like I could fly Now, Bert.

Do you wanna put up with that? That's the ticket! Come on, my lad. Is that the best you can do? - Hurry up, boy. Hurry up! - Not so fast, please. Michael! Now really, Bert. You're as bad as the children. Sorry. Whoa, boy! Whoa! Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa. - Just a bit of high spirits, Mary Poppins. - Please control yourself. - We are not on a racecourse. - (bugle call) (dogs bark and bay) Follow me, please. - Good morning. - Oh, yes, quite.

There probably aren't words to describe your emotions. Now, now, now, now, gentlemen, please. On the contrary, there's a very good word. - Am I right, Bert? - Tell 'em what it is.

Stay close now. Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings. Well, there's more where they came from. Meantime, I'm changing businesses. This here is lovely hot-chestnut weather. Come along, children. - Bye, Bert. - Bye-bye. - Bye, Bert. Bye. - Bye, Jane and Michael. # Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo # La dum, da da dum, da da da da dum... (Michael) No, no, I won't take your nasty medicine! Do we have to, Mary Poppins? People who get their feet wet must learn to take their medicine. - I don't want it. I'm not gonna... - (shrieks) Lime cordial! Delicious! Strawberry! Mmm! Rum punch. Quite satisfactory. (hiccups) Mary Poppins, you won't ever leave us, will you? Do you have a handkerchief under your pillow? Will you stay if we promise to be good? Och! That's a piecrust promise. Easily made, easily broken. Whatever would we do without you? I shall stay until the wind changes. But, Mary Poppins, how long will that be? Silence, please. It's time to go to sleep. Oh, we couldn't possibly go to sleep! So many lovely things have happened today. Did they? Yes! When we jumped into Bert's chalk picture... And we rode the merry-go-round, and all the horses jumped off, and... And we all went riding in the countryside! (both) Tally Ho! Tchunga! Tchunga! Yikes! Really? Mary Poppins, don't you remember? You won the horse race! A respectable person like me in a horse race? How dare you suggest such a thing. But I saw you do it! Now, not another word, or I shall have to summon a policeman. Is that clear? It did happen! I saw it! - Go to sleep. - No, I don't want to go to sleep. Mary Poppins, we're much too excited! Very well, suit yourselves. # Stay awake # Don't rest your head # Don't lie down # Upon your bed # While the moon drifts in the skies # Stay awake # Don't close your eyes # Though the world is fast asleep # Though your pillow's soft and deep # You're not sleepy as you seem # Stay awake # Don't nod and dream # Stay awake # Don't nod # and... # dream (whistle) Glorious day, Mr Binnacle. Glorious! No one sleeps this morning. Put in a double charge of powder. A double charge? Aye aye, sir. Shake things up a bit, what? - Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen. - Indeed it is, ma'am. Have you put the spoiled eggs in my carryall? Yes, ma'am. After our meeting at the Albert Hall, we're all going to Downing Street to throw things at the prime minister. Oh, how distinguished you look this morning, George. What's all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen? - It's Cook singing. - Cook singing? What's wrong with her? She's as happy as a cricket. As a matter of fact, since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing seems to have come over the household. - Is that so? - Take Ellen, for instance. She hasn't broken a dish all morning. - Really? Well, that is extraordinary. - And another thing. She and Cook usually fight like cats and dogs, but today... - Let me hold the door for you, Ellen dear. - Thanks ever so, ducks. (Ellen sings) La la la la, la la la la - Ellen, stop making that offensive noise! - (bird chirruping) And shut the window! That bird's giving me a headache. Yes, sir. Quiet! You're giving the master a headache. I'm so sorry you're not feeling well this morning, George. Who said I'm not feeling well? I'm fit as a fiddle. I just don't understand why everyone's so confoundedly cheerful! # Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious # Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious - # Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious - How lovely. Thank you, my darling. # Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious - # Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious - Stop, stop, stop! - Good morning, Father. - Good morning. Mary Poppins taught us the most wonderful word. # Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious What on earth are you talking about? Supercali... Super... Or whatever the infernal thing is. It's something to say when you don't know what to say. Yes, well, I always know what to say. Go on, hurry along, please. Yes, Father. # Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious... Winifred, will you be good enough to explain this unseemly hullabaloo? I don't think there's anything to explain, do you? It's obvious that you're out of sorts this morning. The children just came in to make you feel better. I should like to make one thing quite clear, once and for all: I am not out of sorts. I am in a perfectly equable mood. I do not require being made to feel better! But you're always saying that you wanted a cheerful and pleasant household. Winifred, I should like to make a slight differentiation between the word cheerful and just plain giddy irresponsibility. Excuse me, dear. Posts, everyone, please! I have no objection to anyone being cheerful or pleasant. But I do expect a certain decorum. I can tell you one thing, Winifred. I don't propose standing idly by and letting that woman Mary Poppins undermine the discipline... There's something odd - I may say extremely odd - about the behaviour of this household since that woman arrived. And I want you to know that I've noticed it! - Yes, dear. - (piano plays out of tune) - One thing more. - Yes, dear? I suggest you have this piano repaired. When I sit down to an instrument, I like to have it in tune. But, George, you don't play. Madam, that is entirely beside the point! Now, let me see. First of all, we must go to the piano tuner's. And then we go to Mrs Cory's sh... Mrs Cory's shop for some gingerbread. Ah, gingerbread! And then we go to the fishmonger's, I think, for a nice dover sole and a pint of prawns. Michael, stop stravaiging along behind. Ahoy, there! Ahoy! - Good day to you! - Good morning, Admiral. Michael, what fine adventure are we out upon today? Going to fight the Hottentots? Dig for buried treasure? We're going to buy some fish. - Very good! Proceed at flank speed. - Aye aye, sir. Let's put our backs into it, lad. More spit and polish, that's what's wanted around here. (barking) It's Andrew! (barks) Not so fast, please. I can't understand a word you're saying. - Again? - (barks) - Oh, the poor man! - (barks) - (sneezes) - Bless you. Well, yes, of course. There's not a moment to lose. I'll go straight away. And thank you very much. - What did he say? - He said, "You're welcome." - What else did he say? - I don't think he said anything. You know best, as usual. (Michael) I thought we were gonna buy some fish. There's been a change of plan. Come along, please. Don't straggle. - (Andrew whines) - Andrew, worrying won't help anyone. Why don't you go home and put your feet up? (door bell) - Oh, Bert, I'm glad you're here. - I came over the moment I heard. Well, how is he? I never seen him as bad as this, and that's the truth. How about them? It's contagious, you know. - Shall we get spots? - Oh, highly unlikely. (laughter) - Oh, Uncle Albert! - Oh, bless me! Bless my soul! It's Mary Poppins! I'm delight... (laughs) I'm delighted to see you, Mary. - Uncle Albert, you promised. - Oh, I know, I... But I tried. Really I did, my dear. I... (laughs) But I so enjoy laughing, you know? And when... And when I start, it's all up with the... That's what happens to me. I love to laugh! Oh, my goodness! I can't help it. You can see that. I just like laughing, that's all. Jane, don't you dare! You'll only make him worse. It's really quite serious. Yes, whatever you do, keep a straight face. Last time it took us three days to get him down. # I love to laugh (laughs) # Loud and long and clear # I love to laugh (laughs) # It's getting worse every year # The more I laugh # The more I fill with glee - You're no help at all. - # The more the glee # The more I'm a merrier me It's embarrassing. # The more I'm a merrier me # Some people laugh through their noses # Sounding something like this (giggles) - Dreadful! - Tss-sss-sss-sss! # Some people laugh through their teeth, goodness sakes # Hissing and fizzing like snakes Tss-sss-sss. Not at all attractive to my way of thinking. # Some laugh too fast (giggles) # Some only blast Haaa! # Others, they twitter like birds (chirrups) You know, you're as bad as he is. # Then there's that kind what can't make up their mind (laughs in a combination of all the styles) # When things strike me as funny # I can't hide it inside and squeak Hee! # As the squeakelers do # I've got to let go with a ho-ho-ho-ho # And laugh How nice! I was hoping you'd turn up. - Turn up! - We always have such a jolly time. # We love to laugh # Loud and long and clear # We love to laugh # So everybody can hear # The more you laugh Whoops, don't you two start. Come back down here. # The more you fill with glee # The more the glee # The more we're a merrier we Oh, welcome, children! Welcome! Make yourselves comfortable. That's right. Pull up a chair. Oh, pull up... I must say, you're a sight, the lot of you! Speaking of sight, it reminds me of me brother. He's got a nice cushy job in a watch factory. In a watch factory? What does he do? He stands about all day and makes faces! He makes faces in a watch fa... You made that up. That's so good! Such behaviour! Well, it's the most disgraceful sight I've ever seen, or my name isn't Mary Poppins. Speaking of names, I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith. What's the name of his other leg? Wasn't that funny? What's the name of his other... Now then, children, it's time for tea. I will not have my schedule interrupted. Oh, please stay. Look, I have a splendid tea all ready for you. And it's getting cold. Well, I had hoped that maybe, that you would just, that... Splendid! Thank you very much! Keep your feet back. Mind the bread and butter. Now, watch it, children. I knew she could bring it off. And a proper tea it is too. Next thing, I suppose, you'll be wanting me to pour out. Oh, well. If I must, I must. If you'll just stop behaving like a pack of laughing hyenas! - Two lumps, Uncle Albert? - Yes, please. - Bert? - No, thank you, no sugar for me. I'm so glad you came. It wouldn't be any fun without you. Here, and you may pour some milk for Michael and yourself. Nice weather we're having this time of year, don't you think? Oh, yeah. Speaking of weather... The other day when it was so cold, a friend of mine went to buy some long underwear. The shopkeeper said to him, "How long do you want it?" And my friend said, "Well, from about September to March." Jane! Control yourself! Children, will you please sit up properly at the table? - Your tea, Uncle Albert. - Oh, thank you, my dear. I'm having such a good time. I wish that you could all stay up here all the time. We'll jolly well have to. There's no way to get down. Oh, no, there is a way. Frankly, I don't like to mention it, because you have to think of something sad. Then do get on with it, please. Let me see... I've got the very thing. Yesterday, when the lady next door answered the bell, there was a man there. And the man said to the lady, "I'm terribly sorry. I just ran over your cat." - Oh, that's sad. - The poor cat. And then the man said, "I'd like to replace your cat." And the lady said, "That's all right with me, but how are you at catching mice?" Well, you know, I started out sad. I try, really I do. But, but everything ends up so hilarious, I can't... I can't help... That will be quite enough of that! It's time to go home. - Oh, that is sad. - Oh, no! Oh, that's sad. That's the saddest thing I ever heard. Come along, children. Spit spot! Must you really go? You know, people come to see me all the time, you know. And we have such a lovely time, and then they have to go home. And I'm very, very sad about the whole thing. Don't worry. We'll come back soon. We had a lovely time. Keep an eye on Uncle Albert, will you, Bert? - I'll sit with him a while. - Thank you. Come on. Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke I saved for just such an occasion. - Would you like to hear it? - I'd be so grateful. Righto. Well, it's about me granddad, see? One night he had a nightmare, he did. He was so scared that he chewed his pillow to bits. To bits. Next morning I says, "How do you feel, Granddad?" He says, "Oh, not bad. A little down in the mouth." Yeah, I always say there's nothing like a good joke. No. And that was nothing like a good joke! That... Bit late tonight, aren't you, Banks? I say, Banks! Is anything the matter, Banks? Banks! - Oh, Father, we're so glad you're home! - Want to hear a joke? We had the most wonderful afternoon with Mary Poppins. Speaking of afternoons, the joke goes like this: I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith. Smith? We don't know anyone called Smith. And there was a second chap, and the second chap says, "What's the name of his other leg?" And we had a lovely tea party on the ceiling! Oh, children, please be quiet. Mary Poppins says if we're good, she'll take us there again. Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins said that, did she? Will you please return to your room? Mary Poppins, will you be kind enough to come with me? As you wish. Mary Poppins, I very much regret what I must say to you. Good evening, George. Is anything the matter? I'm afraid there is. I'd love to stay, but I have to dress for my rally in Hampstead. Winifred, it is my wish that you be present! Oh, yes, George, of course. Mary Poppins, I must confess I am extremely disappointed in you. She's for it now. I've heard the master do this speech before. I don't deny that I am partially responsible for allowing the children to spend their days on worthless frivolity to the exclusion of all else. But it is high time they learned the seriousness of life! But, George, they're only children. Precisely. And in the light of what has happened... George, are you certain you know what you're doing? I believe I do, Winifred. # A British bank is run with precision # A British home requires nothing less # Tradition, discipline and rules must be the tools # Without them, disorder, chaos # Moral disintegration # In short, you have a ghastly mess I quite agree. # The children must be moulded, shaped and taught # That life's a looming battle to be faced and fought In short, I am disturbed to hear my children talking about popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures, consorting with racehorse persons, fox hunting... Yes, well, I don't mind that quite so much. At any rate, it's traditional. But tea parties on the ceiling? I ask you. Having tea parties on the ceiling and highly questionable outings of every other kind! # If they must go on outings These outings ought to be # Fraught with purpose Yes, and practicality # These silly words like Superca... Super... - Superca... - Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Yes, well done. You said it. # And popping through pictures # Have little use Fulfil no basic need # They've got to learn the honest truth # Despite their youth They must learn... - # About the life you lead - Exactly. # They must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book - # A thousand ciphers neatly in a row - Quite right. # When gazing at a graph that shows the profit's up - # Their little cup of joy should overflow - Precisely! # It's time they learned to walk in your footsteps My footsteps. # To tread your straight and narrow path with pride With pride. # Tomorrow, just as you suggest, Pressed and dressed # Jane and Michael will be at your side Splendid! You hit the nail right on the... At my side? Where are we going? To the bank, of course, exactly as you proposed. - I proposed? - Of course. Now, if you'll excuse me. Tomorrow's an important day for the children. I shall see they have a proper night's sleep. Good night. Winifred, did I say that I was going to take the children to the bank? It certainly sounded that way, dear. And why not? A capital idea! Just the medicine they need for all this slipshod, sugary female thinking they get around here all day long. Quite right. Good idea. Quite right. Good idea. Quite right. - Mary Poppins, we won't let you go! - Go? What on earth are you talking about? - Didn't you get sacked? - Sacked? Certainly not! I am never sacked! - Oh, Mary Poppins! - Hurray, hurray, hurray! Neither am I a maypole. Kindly stop spinning about me. - But... - Goats butt, birds fly, and children who are going on an outing with their father must get some sleep. - Come along, please. - An outing with Father? - Yes. - I don't believe it. - He's never taken us on an outing before. - He's never taken us anywhere. - However did you manage it? - Manage what? You must've put the idea in his head somehow. What an impertinent thing to say! Me putting ideas into people's heads? Really! - Where's he taking us? - To the bank. Oh, Michael, the city! And we'll see all the sights, and Father can point them out to us. Well, most things he can. But sometimes a person we love, through no fault of his own, can't see past the end of his nose. Past the end of his nose? Yes. Sometimes a little thing can be quite important. Oh, look! The cathedral. Father passes that every day. He sees that. # Early each day to the steps of St Paul's # The little old bird woman comes # In her own special way # To the people she calls # Come buy my bags full of crumbs # Come feed the little birds # Show them you care # And you'll be glad if you do # Their young ones are hungry # Their nests are so bare # All it takes is tuppence from you # Feed the birds # Tuppence a bag # Tuppence, tuppence # Tuppence a bag # Feed the birds # That's what she cries # While overhead # Her birds fill the skies # All around the cathedral # The saints and apostles look down as she sells her wares # Although you can't see it # You know they are smiling # Each time someone shows that he cares # Though her words # Are simple and few # Listen, listen # She's calling to you # Feed the birds # Tuppence a bag # Tuppence, tuppence # Tuppence a bag # Though her words # Are simple and few # Listen, listen # She's calling to you # Feed the birds # Tuppence a bag # Tuppence, tuppence # Tuppence a bag (Mr Banks) Now remember that a bank is a quiet and decorous place, so we must be on our best behaviour. But I thought it was your bank. Yes, well, I'm one of the younger officers, so in a sense it is, sort of. Michael, look! - (Jane) It's her! - Who? It's who? The bird woman. Just where Mary Poppins said she would be. - You do see her, don't you, Father? - Well, of course I can see her. Do you think I can't see past the end of my nose? Listen, Father, she's saying it. Feed the birds. Tuppence a bag. Well, of course she's saying it. What else would she be saying? - Please may we feed the birds? - Whatever for? - I have tuppence from my money box. - Just this once, please? Waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds? Certainly not. But Mary Poppins... I am not interested in what Mary Poppins says. Nor do I wish to keep hearing her name for the remainder of the day. Now come along! But it's my tuppence! Michael, I will not permit you to throw your money away! When we get to the bank, I shall show you what may be done with your tuppence. And I think you'll find it extremely interesting. Hello, Banks. What's all this about? - These are my children, Mr Dawes. - Well, so I assumed. - But why are they here? - They wish to open an account, sir. - Oh, indeed? - Yes. And just how much money do you have, young man? - Tuppence. But I want it to feed the birds. - Sh-sh-sh. Tuppence? Tuppence? Precisely how I started. That's the chairman of the bank, the elder Mr Dawes. A giant in the world of finance. - A giant? - Sh-sh-sh. Uh, Father, these are Banks's children. They want to open an account. Oh, they do, do they, boy? Excellent, excellent. We can always use... use more money to put to work for the bank, can't we, boy? So, you have tuppence? May I be permitted to see it? No. I want it to feed the birds. Fiddlesticks, boy! Feed the birds and what have you got? Fat birds! But... # If you invest your tuppence # Wisely in the bank # Safe and sound # Soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank # Will compound # And you'll achieve that sense of conquest # As your affluence expands # In the hands # Of the directors # Who invest (coughs) # As propriety...

There's something wrong. The bank won't give someone their money! Well, I'm going to get mine! Come along, young man! Every penny! - And mine too! - And give me mine too! Stop all payments. Stop all payments. - Michael! Jane! - Give me my money! - Children, come back here. - Stop those children! Jane! Michael! (man) Give me my money! I want my money! Come on. Stop those children! - Stop those children! - (whistle) (screams) Come with me, my dears. Granny'll hide you! - (growls and barks) - (screams) (both scream) - Here, here, half a mo. - Leave her alone! Leave my sister alone! Easy, now. Your old friend ain't gonna hurt ya. Bert, it's you! In the flesh and at your service. - You're filthy! - Oh, perhaps a smudge or two. It so happens that today I'm a chimney sweep. Oh, Bert, we're so frightened. Now, now, don't take on so. Bert'll take care of you like I was your own father. - Now, who's after you? - Father is. - What? - He brought us to see his bank. I don't know what we did, but it must've been something dreadful. He sent the police after us, and the army and everything. Michael, don't exaggerate. Well, now, there must be some mistake. Your dad's a fine gentleman, and he loves ya! I don't think so. You should've seen the look on his face. He doesn't like us at all. Well, now that don't seem likely, does it? It's true. Let's sit down. You know, begging your pardon, but the one my heart goes out to is your father. There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day, hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money. I don't like to see any living thing caged up. Father in a cage? They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know. Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all. Father's not in trouble. We are. Oh, sure about that, are you? Look at it this way. You've got your mother to look after you. And Mary Poppins and Constable Jones and me. Who looks after your father? Tell me that. When something terrible happens, what does he do? Fends for himself, he does. Who does he tell about it? No one! Don't blab his troubles at home. He just pushes on at his job, uncomplaining and alone and silent. - He's not very silent! - Michael, be quiet. Bert, do you think Father really needs our help? Well, it's not my place to say. I only observe that a father can always do with a bit of help. Come on, I'll take you home. # Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheree # A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be # Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo # Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you # Or blow me a kiss # And that's lucky too # Now as the ladder of life has been strung # You might think a sweep's on the bottommost rung # Though I spends me time in the ashes and smoke # In this whole wide world there's no happier bloke #Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheree # A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be # Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo # Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you # Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheree # A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be # Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo # Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you Oh, Ellen, see who that is and send them away. - I'm dreadfully late. - Yes, ma'am. - Well, I'll be gettin' along now. - Oh, please stay till Father comes home. He'll feel much better if you shake hands with him. - It's the children, ma'am. - I thought they were with their father. You haven't been running off again, have you? You know how terribly it upsets me. Oh, they haven't exactly been running away, ma'am. They have had bit of a fright though. Need someone to look after 'em. Oh, of course! Mary Poppins will. Oh, no, it's her day off! - Ellen, I wonder if you would... - No, ma'am. I haven't done me brasses yet. - Well, will you ask Mrs Brill? - Not for a hundred quid, ma'am. This here is baking day, and you know how Cook is! What about you, sir? You've been so kind in looking after the children. Me, ma'am? I have to be moving along. The lord mayor's got a stopped-up chimney. Chimney. How clever of you to know. Our drawing room chimney's in the most ghastly condition. Smokes incessantly. Thank you so much! - But... - Besides, it'll amuse the children. The lord mayor's gonna be terrible put out. Oh, thank you so much. I do appreciate it. I must hurry. Our gallant ladies in prison are waiting for me to lead them in song! Goodbye, my darlings. See you soon. # I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do # A broom for the shaft and a brush for the flue Oh, it's awfully dark and gloomy up there. There now - you see how wrong people can be? That there is what you might call a doorway to a place of enchantment. # Up where the smoke is all billowed and curled # 'Tween pavement and stars # Is the chimney-sweep world # When there's hardly no day # Nor hardly no night # There's things half in shadow # And halfway in light # On the rooftops of London # Coo, what a sight I do wish we could go up there. So do I! I like chimneys. Oh, rightly so! A chimney is a wondrous thing. She's built tall right up there on the roof. When the wind is just right, it blows across her top and draws the smoke right up the flue. Here. Feel the pull on the end of that brush. It's like you've got a whale on the end of the line, ain't it? Michael, be careful. You never know what may happen around a fireplace. Oh, bother! (Jane) Michael! Michael, come back down here. - Michael! Michael, where are you? - Well, that's a bit awkward, I must say. Bert, I'll thank you to stop putting ideas in their heads! - There goes the other one. - Shall I go after 'em? Well, we can't have them gallivanting up there like kangaroos, can we? Michael, don't be frightened. Everything's going... Will you put your things on at once? - Hurry up, please. Spit spot! - There you are! I thought you'd left us. We didn't mean to. Well, no harm done. Truth is, this is what you might call a fortuitous circumstance. Look there. A trackless jungle just waiting to be explored. - Why not, Mary Poppins? - Oh, please, Mary Poppins? Please! Oh, well. If we must, we must. Fall in. Look lively, look lively. Jump to it, jump to it! Get in line. Attention! A-slope arms! Around turn! Quick march! Hello, there! It's just good, clean soot, Michael. - As far as we go, right? - Not at all. What did I tell ya? There's the whole world at your feet. And who gets to see it but the birds, the stars and the chimney sweeps? Quite nice, but we should all get in out of the night air. Follow me, please. # Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheree # When you're with a sweep you're in glad company # Nowhere is there a more happier crew # Than them what sings chim chim cheree, chim cheroo # Chim chiminy chim chim # Cheree chim cheroo - (man) Cheroo! - (man #2) Cheroo! - Cheroo! - Cheroo!

Had an elegant time, guv'nor. Good luck, guv'nor. Oh, Father, every one of those sweeps shook your hand. You're going to be the luckiest person in the world! - Come along, children. Spit spot. - Just a moment, Mary Poppins. - What is the meaning of this outrage? - I beg your pardon? Will you be good enough to explain all this? First of all, I would like to make one thing quite clear. Yes? I never explain anything. (phone) Yes. Banks here. Mr Dawes! I'm most dreadfully sorry, sir, about what happened at the bank today. I can assure you that... Tonight, sir? Yes, Banks. We'll expect you at nine o'clock precisely. - Without fail. - Without fail. Why, yes, Banks. It's extremely serious. - We regret this course of action. - We regret this course of action. After all, you have been with us a good many years. After all, you have been with us a good many years. - As was your father before you. - As was your father before you. Yes, Mr Dawes. I shall be there at nine o'clock. A man has dreams of walking with giants. To carve his niche in the edifice of time. # Before the mortar of his zeal # Has a chance to congeal The cup is dashed from his lips! The flame is snuffed a-borning. He's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime. Life is a rum go, guv'nor, and that's the truth. You know what I think? It's that woman Mary Poppins. From the moment she stepped into this house, things began to happen to me! - Mary Poppins? - Yes, yes, of course. # My world was calm # Well-ordered # Exemplary # Then came this person # With chaos in her wake # And now my life's ambitions go # With one fell blow # It's quite a bitter pill # To take It's that Poppins woman! She did it! I know the very person you mean. Mary Poppins. She's the one what sings... # A spoonful of sugar # That is all it takes # It changes bread and water # Into tea and cakes You see? That's exactly what I mean! Changing bread and water into tea and cakes, indeed! No wonder everything's higgledy-piggledy here. # A spoonful of sugar # Goes a long, long way # Have yourself a healthy helpin' # Every day An 'ealthy helpin' of trouble, if you ask me. Do you know what she did? I realise it now. She tricked me into taking Jane and Michael to the bank. That's how all the trouble started. Tricked you into taking the children on an outing? - Yes. - Outrageous! A man with all the important things you have to do. Shameful! You're a man of high position. Esteemed by your peers. # And when your little tykes are cryin' # You haven't time to dry their tears # And see them grateful little faces # Smilin' up at you # Because their dad # He always knows just what to do - Well, I mean, look, I don't think I... - Like you say, guv'nor. # You've got to grind, grind, grind # At that grindstone # Though childhood slips # Like sand through a sieve # And all too soon they've up and grown # And then they've flown # And it's too late # For you to give # Just that spoonful of sugar # To help the medicine go down # The medicine go down # Medicine go down Well, goodbye, guv'nor. Sorry to have troubled you. (whistles tune) Father? We're sorry about the tuppence. We didn't know it would cause you so much trouble. Here, Father, you can have the tuppence. Will that make everything all right? Thank you. (Mr Dawes) Come in. Take your hat off, Banks. (Mr Banks) Good evening, gentlemen. Well, get on with it. Go on. Yes, Father. In 1773, an official of this bank unwisely loaned a large sum of money to finance a shipment of tea to the American colonies. - Do you know what happened? - Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do. As the ship lay in Boston Harbour, a party of the colonists, dressed as Red Indians, boarded the vessel, behaved very rudely, and threw all the tea overboard. This made the tea unsuitable for drinking, even for Americans. Precisely. The loan was defaulted. Panic ensued within these walls. There was a run on the bank! From that time to this, sir, there has not been a run on this bank. Until today! A run, sir, caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son. - Do you deny it? - I do not deny it, sir. And I shall be only too glad to assume responsibility for my son. What are you waiting for? Get on with it! Yes, Father. - No, not that! - Steady on. (thud) Well, do you have anything to say, Banks? Well, sir, they do say that when there's nothing to say, all you can say... Confound it, Banks! I said, do you have anything to say? - Just one word, sir. - Yes? Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. What? Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Mary Poppins was right. It's extraordinary. It does make you feel better! (laughs) What are you talking about, man? There's no such word. Oh, yes. It is a word. A perfectly good word actually. Do you know what there's no such thing as? It turns out, with due respect, when all is said and done, that there's no such thing as you! Impertinence, sir! Speaking of impertinence, would you like to hear a perfectly marvellous joke? - A real snapper! - Joke? Snapper? Yes. There are these two wonderful young people, Jane and Michael. And they meet one day on the street, and Jane says to Michael, "I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith." And Michael says, "Really? What's the name of his other leg?" The man's gone mad. Call the guard! Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. I'm feeling better all the time! Banks, don't you dare strike my father! There's the tuppence. The wonderful, fateful, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious tuppence. Guard it well. Goodbye! - Banks, where are you going? - I don't know. I might pop through a chalk pavement picture and go for an outing in the country. Or I might seize a horse off a merry-go-round and win the Derby! Or I might just fly a kite! Only Poppins would know! - Poppins? - My nanny. She's the one who sings that ridiculous song. # A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down # The medicine go down The medicine go down... Mad as a March hare. A wooden leg named Smith. A wooden leg named Smith. A wooden le... (laughs) Father? Father! Father, come down! Daddy! Daddy, come back! Wind's come around, blowing dead on from the west! She doesn't care what happens to us. She only promised to stay till the wind changed. Isn't that right, Mary Poppins? Will you bring me my hat stand, please? Mary Poppins, don't you love us? And what would happen to me, may I ask, if I loved all the children I said goodbye to? Yes, sir, that's right. George W Banks. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. About six foot one, I'd say, sir. Oh, yes, we rang up his bank first thing this morning. The only thing we discovered was he'd been discharged last night. No telling what he might do in a fit of despondency. Wouldn't hurt to have them drag the river. There's a nice spot there by Southwark Bridge - popular with jumpers. Really, Ellen! He seemed to have been a fine, stable gentleman, sir. No hanky-panky, if you know what I mean. Oh, regular habits, sir. Well, far as anyone knows. # (Mr Banks)... The medicine go down Just a spoonful... - It's him! - Or something that sounds like him. Mrs Banks, could we have a little less noise on the premises? I can't make out what the inspector's sayin'. # Just a spoonful of sugar Makes the medicine go down... George! Oh, George, you didn't jump in the river. How sensible of you. It's all right, sir. He's been found! No, alive! Or so I presume. He's a-kissin' Mrs Banks. I've been so worried. What happened at the bank? I've been sacked, discharged, flung into the street! # A spoonful of sugar Makes the medicine go down Gone off his crumpet, that's what he's done. - # Medicine go down... - Dotty as you please. # La la la la la George, what on earth were you doing in the cellar? You'll see in a moment. Where are the children? Jane? Michael? - Your father's calling you. - It doesn't sound like Father. (Mr Banks) Jane! Michael! Run along. Spit spot! You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you? Spit spot. He mended it! - It's wonderful! - However did you manage it? # With tuppence for paper and strings # You can have your own set of wings # With your feet on the ground # You're a bird in flight # With your fist holding tight # To the string of your kite # Oh, oh, oh # Let's go fly a kite # Up to the highest height # Let's go fly a kite # And send it soaring # Up through the atmosphere # Up where the air is clear # Oh, let's go fly a kite A proper kite needs a proper tail, don't you think? That's what I said, sir. Go fly a kite! Oh, no, sir. No, I don't mean you personally. # Let's go fly a kite # Up to the highest height # Let's go fly a kite # And send it soaring # Up through the atmosphere # Up where the air is clear # Oh, let's go fly a kite # When you send it flying up there # All at once you're lighter than air # You can dance on the breeze over houses and trees # With your fist holding tight # To the string of your kite - # Oh, oh, oh - Now! # Let's go fly a kite # Up to the highest height # Let's go fly a kite # And send it soaring Ah, there you are, Banks. I want to congratulate you. Capital bit of humour. "Wooden leg named Smith." Or Jones, whatever it was. Father died laughing. Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. Oh, no, nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about. Never seen him happier in his life. He left an opening for a new partner. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much indeed, sir. # Up through the atmosphere # Up where the air is clear # Oh, let's go # Fly a kite (croaks) That's gratitude for you. Didn't even say goodbye. No, they didn't. Look at them. You know, they think more of their father than they do of you. - That's as it should be. - Well, don't you care? Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking. Is that so? Well, I'll tell you one thing, Mary Poppins - you don't fool me a bit. - Oh, really? - Yes, really. I know exactly how you feel about these children. And if you think I'm gonna keep my mouth shut any longer, I... That will be quite enough of that, thank you. Goodbye, Mary Poppins. Don't stay away too long. # Oh, oh, oh # Let's go fly a kite # Up to the highest height # Let's go fly a kite # And send it soaring # Up through the atmosphere # Up where the air is clear # Oh, let's go # Fly a kite
