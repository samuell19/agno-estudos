Do you have to wear it like every single day? - Hey, hey. Respect the jacket, huh. Would you lovely ladies like to sit down and have lunch with us today? - Are you trying to totally ruin our reputation? - Oh, that hurts. That's painful. Come on, Maria. This is my friend Mateo. Say hello. - I told you he was a faggot. - [Mr. Lopez] Hey, hey, hey. Cut it out now for real. - Let's get out of here. I'm hungry. - Give me $2.

She's not interested in pussies like you. You know how many guys are in line to get some of that? - Hey, don't talk to her like that. - [Lacey] Thank you, Conner. - Hey kid, why don't you get the hell out of here, okay. Somebody needs attention. - You guys see what she was wearing. Looks like Goodwill had a sale. Come on, Lacey. We're going. - Hey Lacey. You look really good today. - See, I told you you'd thank me for posting that picture. - I'm getting some. (soft music) - God, oh my God.

(soft music) We have a new student whose joined our class today. Miss Gabriella Lopez. - You can sit by me. - [Mr. Coleman] We're glad you're here. - Thanks. - Hey, I have a set of earbuds for the first person that can I remember what we talked about yesterday in class. Carson. - [Carson] The rise of fascism. - Carson is correct. Adolf Hitler and the rise of fascism in Germany. Tell me something. What would you do if something like that were to happen here? - [Mateo] That's it. I've had enough of what you're doing to me. (soft music) - Hi. You're sitting at our table. - I didn't know the lunchroom had assigned seats. - Well they do assigned by me and we don't want any strange girl sitting at our table. Sorry. - You know, I could fight about it, but you beach barbies just aren't worth it. - Stupid slut. - What'd you call me? - Nothing. Bye. Seriously, what the hell? Who does she think she is? Like I own this school. - Who is she anyways? - Yeah Lacey, did you ever find out? - Somebody posted she's from New York. - I don't want some strange weirdo chick from New York sitting at our table. - She's not pretty enough to sit at our table. - Let's start some drama. (soft music) Dyke alert. New York lesbo. - Do we have to add dyke alert? - [Ashley] Hashtag dyke. - Yes, done and done. - Don't tag me 'cause my mom follows me. - So does mine on my real account not my finsta, duh. Oh, did I forget to add you? - Man, there's that kid again. If there's one thing that gets to my nerves, it's creepy little mama's boys shaking their butts in my face. - Looks like he's in third grade. - Hey faggot. Hey. I'm talking to you, homo. - Better not ignore him, kid. Or he'll kick your butt all the way back to kindergarten. - The lunchroom is closed to kids like you. You hear me? - [Conner] Okay. - 'Cause you know I don't like being ignored. - Hey. You want some attention? Now you've got mine. - It's ugly jacket girl. I'm starting to think you're in love with me or something. What the hell do you want? - I want you to leave him alone. - [Woman] Robert Courtland, please come to the office. Robert Courtland, please come to the office immediately. - I don't know who you are, where you came from. You better stay out of my business 'cause you don't know who you're dealing with. - I'm not afraid of you. - Well maybe you should be. (dramatic music) - He's just kidding around. Once you get to know him, he's okay. - So you think that beating up weaker and smaller kids in the lunchroom is okay? (soft music) - Hey Robert. Just have a seat please. - [Mr. Dawson] You know Courtland, you get me in a lot of trouble for this. - Hey man, since when you were ever afraid of a little trouble? I saved your ass in 10th grade. You remember? - Yeah, that's true. - I'm telling you. I've known Robert a long time. He's just going through. - Going through what? (soft music) - Dad. - Good to see you, kid. Hey. Geez man, I don't see you for like a week and you're already like a foot taller. What your mom feeding ya? - Like I only have a couple minutes 'til lunch is over so. - [Mr. Courtland] I'd like to talk to ya. Can I do that please? - You know the cops said I'm really not supposed to-- - Oh, oh, oh, cops. I don't freaking believe this. You're my son. You can talk to me whenever you freaking want. 17 years I played ball with you. I take you hunting. I make one little mistake and all of a sudden I can't even talk to you. - You broke her arm, dad. - Well you think I don't regret that every day of my? This whole thing is just one massive misunderstanding. It's a freaking comedy is what it is. - Yeah, everyone's laughing. - I lose my shit one split second and for that I'm locked out of my own house. Who pays for that house? - Okay, time's up, Courtland. - Jesus Christ, man. I can't talk privately with my kid for five minutes. - Come on, I'm doing you a favor. - I know. I know. Just give me a minute, please. (soft music) So it's interesting. I went to the house this morning and I couldn't get in the front door. You wanna tell me what's going on there? - You were at the house, Dad? Was mom there? - No, I'm not an idiot. I waited 'til she was gone at her little gym or whatever. Listen, here's the situation. I have to pick something up at the house and I can't get through the front door. - Yeah, mom changed the locks. - Look, I'm not gonna tell anybody. It's just that you know I want him to stop picking on that kid. He doesn't deserve it. Nobody does. (soft music) And. (soft music) - So what's this, like a diary? - It's a journal. - So what you like write down all your secrets? - I guess. Something like that. - Are you gonna write about meeting me today? - Don't flatter yourself. It's just like poems and stuff. - So what type of poems? - It's just stuff about my dad mainly. I don't wanna talk about it. - Bobby. I need you to get something from the house for me. - Dad. - I don't want her giving my stuff to some freaking cop the minute I'm out the door. You listen. Take this key. Don't lose it. Come on, you know what this is for. Put it away. Don't lose it. I want you to find a time when your mom is not snooping around like she always does. Okay? Take this key and find a case behind in the garage. - Dad, no. No, I can't do that. - What do you mean you can't do that? Of course you can. Hey what, come on. What? What are you a pussy, man? Come on, what are you a little faggot chicken shit? - [Robert] Get off of me. - Hey, watch your tone. I brought you into this fucking world you little punk. Don't you fucking turn your back on me. I need you to get something for me from that fucking house and I can't get in it. - Mom told me I'm not supposed to talk-- - I don't give a fucking flying crap what your mama said. Can you imagine what it's like to be locked out of your own house? A house you paid for. Don't you walk out that fucking door on me. Piece of chicken shit. - Get off me. - Don't you raise your tone with me. - [Robert] What are you gonna break my arm, too? - You're gonna do this for me. It's mine. I bought it, all right. - Dad. - Huh, what are you some little baby? You gonna cry now? - Okay, that's it. I'm serious. That's it. Robert, use your head. Let him get back to the lunchroom. (soft music) - Hey remember what I said. I'll call you. We'll meet up. Hey, it's a new number, but you'll know it's me. - What are you doing? - [Mr. Courtland] What? I'm talking to my kid is what I'm doing. What are you doing? - You gotta keep it together. Come on, I'm escorting you to your car. - [Mr. Courtland] Come on, give me a break. - Get out, let's go. (dramatic music) - Hey. What did I tell you about shaking your butt in my face? - My locker's here. - Just gonna have to teach you a lesson, huh, 'cause I'm tired of seeing you every time I turn around. - I. I. - What? You got something to say, huh? Huh? You little piece of shit. I oughta put you in the trashcan 'cause that's where trash belongs. You know what? No. I oughta put you in the toilet, huh. That's where shit like you goes. Come on, let's take a trip, huh. Come on, let's take a trip. We'll see how far I can shove your head down-- - [Lacey] What are you doing? - We're just kidding around. Right, kid? - Conner, here's your algebra homework back. - Come on. Like you really let this kid help you with algebra? - Actually he's the one who's probably gonna be making a million bucks and laughing at you. - This kid? A million dollars? This fruitcake? - You should get Robert to help you with your homework. I hear he's pretty good at what he does. - Come on, I wanna get something to eat before the bell rings. (soft music) - I love her. - [Robert] Danny, I've been looking all over for you. What's going on? - I didn't know you two knew each other. - Actually, we don't. (soft music) - What is she like a Mexican? - Build a wall. Seriously, what's going on with you? - [Shauna] Hold up, boys. (soft music) - [Gabriella] Conner, are you okay? (soft music) - Sometimes I think if I had a gun, I'd kill him. Or myself. (soft music) - Your lip's bleeding. Here. Sorry. (soft music) - I'm not gay, you know. - Doesn't matter to me one way or the other. I mean, just the way he throws that word around. Faggot. I mean, what if some kid really was gay? (soft music) Let's just go to the office. I mean, this Robert thing needs to stop. - No. I tried telling Mr. Dawson what was going on, but he just blew it off. I'll probably just go hide in the bathroom 'til lunch is over. - Conner, wait. You can't. - Gabriella. - [Conner] I gotta go. - Conner, wait. - What's he so freaked out about? - Don't even talk to me. - Wait a minute. What's going on? - Okay, for a second I don't know why, but I just thought you might be kind of cool or something, but you're not. You're just like everybody else so. - What's that supposed to mean? What did I do? - Nothing. That's the whole point. (soft music) - Begin this half hour with tragedy in Parkland as many are feared dead after a school shooting in Broward County High School. - Blame it on the guns. - Sound like your father when you talk like that. - I'm just hungry. Missed lunch today. - Why'd you miss lunch? - Busy. - Relax. I'll make you a turkey sandwich. - I can get it. - It's fine. Doesn't even hurt anymore. (soft music) - [Reporter] Now officials are investigating a threat to Manatee County middle school. It's the second senseless shooting there. Just so the district of Manatee County spokesperson. (soft music) Tragedy in Parkland as many our thought dead after a school shooting in Broward County high school. (speaking in foreign language) - What's going on? - There was another school shooting. 14 kids and three teachers killed. - This one was in Florida. - I'm going to my room. - It's my room. No, it's my room. (dramatic music) - Reports are saying that this was one of the deadliest school shootings in modern history. 14 students and three teachers killed. I don't know about you but for me, it breaks my heart. By a show of hands, how many of you were afraid to come to school today? (soft music) - My mom almost wouldn't let me come to school today 'cause she heard that students were bringing guns and knives to school. - We're supposed to just let people with guns on this campus and trust they won't shoot us? - It's freaky. All of this is so real. - What do you even care? You didn't know the people. - Okay, but what if you did know the people? But what if it was your own father that got shot like mine? Seriously, is that what it would take to make any of you give a damn? - Listen to me and hear what I'm saying. This is not gonna happen at our school. Not on our watch. If you see something, say something. Facebook, Instagram. Group text. If you have somebody on there saying nasty things and making these horrible threats, you guys need to say something. You're gonna be the eyes and the ears that the adults won't see. (soft music) (bell ringing) Listen, homework assignment. I need your plans on how to make this school more safe. Gabriella, can I talk to you for a second? Are you okay? This can't be easy for you. (soft music) - Thank you for asking. (soft music) - I'm so sorry about your dad. - Thanks. I'll see you later. (soft music) - Why were you just talking to her? - Just homework. (soft music) - Hey, what's going on? - Nothing. Just stuff with my dad. - Everything okay? - You haven't told anybody, have you? - No. Nobody even knows. Everyone thinks your dad is like the nicest guy ever. - Hey Conner, what are you doing? Do you wanna go eat lunch? - No, I'll probably just hide in the bathroom 'til lunch is over. - Are you sure? We can sit together. - I'm sorry. I gotta go. - Okay, bye. (soft music) - Elbow to knee. Knee to hand. People, people. Hey you. Here for drama club? Come on, we're down one. Come on up. (soft music) - Head to knee. Shoulder, foot. - Lacey, can you take a picture of us two? - [Lacey] Danny, look like you're smiling. - Look like I'm smiling. - Oh my God, is he looking miserable again? Happens every time. Can you get the angle like up a little higher? You're kind of like close. - Danny, you should look happy. - He always looks sad in pictures. I don't know how to get him to smile. - Danny's the happiest person I know. - Good? Okay, yeah. This is gonna look so good on my feed. Look at us. - I'm so tired. I popped a xan and binge watched Netflix all night. - Classy. - What's a xan? - Are you 12? - Are you gonna eat this? - No. - Thanks babe. - Ooh, wait. Okay so like, you and Robert? - Stop, guys. - I mean, why not? Look at her. She's freaking hot. - I mean, you guys would make a cute couple. - Shut up. - Am I embarrassing you? Aw look Danny, she's blushing. I'm sorry. So we think that the four of us should get together this weekend. ♪ I was watching you like the sun come up ♪ ♪ Vintage tee shirt and one two high tops ♪ - I'll be right back. ♪ Taste like gold ♪ ♪ Sweet with obsession ♪ ♪ Show me something new ♪ - He's literally always sneaking off and never telling me where he's going. - [Danny] Hey Gabriella. Where you going? - Out of here. - [Danny] Can I come? - Think the cameras will see us out there? - No, not if we stay on this side of the building. We figured that out way back in ninth grade. ♪ Give up our ghosts ♪ ♪ 'Cause when the morning comes ♪ ♪ Through the wind goes ♪ - Shauna, nothing's going on, okay. You're all he ever talks about. - Doesn't seem like it. - [Robert] Are you gonna finish this? - You can have 'em. - Good job, Lacey. Cut the carbs if you wanna lose weight. - As if she needs to lose weight. You're perfect. - I know. That's what I'm always telling her. You don't need to lose weight in order to be skinny. You just need a little more muscle on your arms. - If you wanna come with us to the gym after school, I can show you some routines. - Yes, we would love that. And Danny's gonna come too, right? Or is he gonna run off somewhere? - Yes, Shauna. He'll be there. - You want half my sandwich? - Yeah, I'm always hungry. - Oh, my mom made these chocolate chip cookies. They're so good. Here. Try this. - Oh my God, these are amazing. - Right? You know, one time in New York, it had been raining and raining for weeks and then out of the blue, there was a perfect day just like this and my friend Gloria and I got the brilliant idea to skip school so we took the B line all the way to Central Park. We spent the whole day running around, feeding the ducks, eating gelato. We figured that we'd just sneak back into school before sixth period like we never even left, but when we got back to the Bronx, my dad was waiting at the subway station and he's just standing there on the platform and when I walked off the train, he came up to me, grabbed me-- - Just knocks the crap out of you right there at the subway station. - No. He tells me that the next time I wanna skip school, I just have to tell him where I'm going so he doesn't have a heart attack. - Your dad sounds cool. - Yeah. Promise me you'll get your friend to stop picking on Conner. (soft music) - Okay, but where did that come from? (soft music) I promise. (soft music) - It's like I can breathe for the first time in forever. - Me and Robert tried to build a fort out here once. He had this great idea to runaway from home and live outside the school. - What is it with you two anyways? - He's my cousin. His mom and him stay with us when Uncle Jack, you know, loses it. - Well, then I mean it shouldn't be that hard to talk to him. - Yeah I mean, he's not the same kid he was when he was sticking up for me at the playground but. I'll see what I can do. I mean, yeah. (bell ringing) - Was that the bell for fourth period? - Yeah. - Bye. - Where the hell have you been? Shauna's been looking all over for you. - I got caught up. - Hey, we're going to the gym with her and Lacey after school. Told her we'd show 'em some moves. - [Danny] Okay. - Okay. Shauna's like the hottest girl in the school. What's gotten into you? - Nothing. I'm just I'm getting kind of tired of her. That's all. - You better figure things out 'case I'm not letting you mess things up with me and Lacey. We work as a team, remember? - [Danny] Yeah. - Loser. - [Danny] Moron. - Jackass. - [Danny] What? Dickhead. - [Robert] I'll see you later, okay? - [Danny] All right. Hey, Robert. - What's up? - I don't know. Nevermind. - I know your problem. - Yeah? - You just need to get laid. - You think? - I'll see you after school. - All right, see ya. Hey Conner. - I'm late for class. - [Danny] No hey, wait a minute. - I was at Nuovo for like six hours yesterday. Spent $300 on it. - I'm getting new highlights on Friday. - Sometimes I think he's gonna kill me. - He's not gonna kill you. - You know as well as I do. I've tried everything I can to make him stop. I've tried running away. - Running away makes him come after you even harder. - [Conner] Ignoring him. - Ignoring him just makes him even more mad. - I even try hiding in the bathroom, but wherever I go, he always seems to track me down. My whole existence has become about surviving lunch. - I'm gonna give you the best advice you're ever gonna get in this school, okay. Just don't act scared. 'Cause guys like Robert, they can smell scared from a mile away. - But I really am scared. - So pretend not to be. Just fake it. - How? - Okay so. Say I'm you. I'll show you what to do. And this better not come back to bite me, okay. - [Conner] All right. - Or I'll do the exact same thing. - I swear. I won't tell anyone. - Now push me. - What? - Yeah, push me. - Okay. - Dude, come on. Hit me harder, come on. There you go. - [Conner] I didn't mean to do that. - No, no, no. You're not as weak as you look. Now hit me again. - You faggot. - [Gabriella] What the hell are you doing? - Nothing. We're just messing around, you know. - Yeah, this is your idea of helping? - What are you talking about? (soft music) Did you tell him to do this? Thanks a lot. - Conner, just. (soft music) What did you do? Tell him to fight back. Tell him that it's no big deal. Tell him boys will be boys. That kid is not the one with the personality problem. It's Robert and guys like you. - What's that supposed to mean? I was trying to help him. - Telling him to fight back is not helping. - I don't see why you're freaking out on me. I'm trying to be the good guy. I don't have time for this. I've got stuff to do. - Danny, wait. Just wait, okay. (soft music) Did you ever? Did you ever hear about a 13 year old boy in New York that brought a gun to school and killed his history teacher? - I don't know. - Well okay. That teacher was my dad. (soft music) - I don't know what to say. - He was just a kid. He was being bullied and it wasn't supposed to happen. But you know. - When me and Robert started at this school, all the older kids would beat us up and stuff. We couldn't wait until we were the big shots. But it's stupid to have to act tough all the time. You get this tight feeling inside and I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack. - Yeah. (soft music) - [Robert] You're not wearing your favorite jacket. What's the matter? Got too hot for ya? Be a shame to cover up that body anyway. - Look, if you're trying to scare me, it's not working. - Does this scare you, bitch? Going after my friends. Turning people against me. I told you once stay out of my business. - Hey. Danny's coming, right? Where is he? - [Robert] We're meeting him there. Better be ready to work it. - [Shauna] We are. Lacey. (gentle music) - Do you think I look fat in this? - Even if you do, that's why we're here, right. (gentle music) - Do you think Robert likes me? - Danny seriously hasn't even texted me back. It's like he's ignoring me on purpose. - Danny loves you. He's probably just playing hard to get. - Robert's the one who can't keep his eyes off of you. That's why you have to be nice to him, okay. Don't mess this up for us. I want them to take us both to prom and it's gonna be perfect. Let's take a picture. - Oh, can you raise it higher? My nose is too big. Oh, my eyes were closed. - Oh, shut up. You look good. Let's go. (soft music) Hey, where have you been? - I was five minutes late to class and they made me stay. - You didn't answer any of my texts either. What are you mad at me or something? - No. - All right, I'm gonna put my hand here for resistance. Okay? No, I'm just making it a little bit harder for you, okay. - [Shauna] You so need this, Lacey. - Hey Robert. - What are you doing here? - Can you believe this guy? Is that how you talk to your old man? Hey Danny boy, how's it going? - Hey Uncle Jack. - Can I borrow him for a minute? - Dad, I'm kind of in the middle-- - Come on over here, man. - [Lacey] Did you see what he just did? - Yeah, it's 'cause he really likes you. Danny didn't even look at me when he got here. - Now I see why you ain't returning my messages. I saw you putting the moves on that hot little blonde over there. - No, I was just about to text you. - No, no, no, no. First tell me. You got in her pants yet? - Dad. - Are you ever gonna talk to me or you just gonna ignore me? - No, dad. Okay, mom's always home. - What did I teach you about making excuses? I told you this was important. - Dad, what do you want it for anyway? - What do I want it for? You just do what I tell you. And tomorrow when I text you, you damn well better answer it. Come back over here. - What, dad? - Come on. How you doing for cash, man? - Fine. - Here. Here. Let me give you this. Here's 50 bucks, okay. I know how cheap your mom is. Spend on that hot little blonde over there, huh. I love you. You know I love you. And I'll see you tomorrow, man. - Just came by to give me weekend money. Fifty bucks. - [Danny] Oh sweet. - Why didn't he just give it to you at home? - Look, are we gonna workout or what? - I have to go. My mom just got called into work and my little brother's home by himself. - We've been here for like five minutes. - My mom. She can't get off. - Guys, it's fine if you wanna stay and workout. I can take Lacey home. - Okay. - [Robert] You ready? - Okay. - See you, Danny. - Bye. - Bye. So sweet of him, isn't it, Danny? - Yeah, that's really nice. - Very thoughtful. - Yeah, he's a nice guy. - Uh huh. (speaking in foreign language) - Mama, what's going on? - The grand jury in Papa's case wants to go for a lesser charge. Sentencing is next week. Ow. - [Gabriella] Mama. Mama, stop. - Oh man. - I got it. I got it. Don't worry, I got it. (speaking in foreign language) - They're just gonna what? Let this kid off in five years. - You just wanna send him to jail for the rest of his life? He's 13, mama. - Well they gotta do something. Your father's death has to mean something. That's it. I'm getting us tickets to New York. - [Gabriella] I was there, remember? - [Rosa] We have to fight this. - [Gabriella] I was there. I know what was going on that day and I'm not going to New York. - [Rosa] Of course you're going. - No, I'm not. - [Rosa] Gabriella, come here. - You made me come to Florida. You made me leave all of my friends and go to what? This awful school with all these horrible kids and now you want me to go back to New York? Are you serious? To sit in that courtroom. That courtroom and just listen to the worst day of my life, mama. The worst day of my life. I can't. I can't sit. I can't go back. I can't go. - [Rosa] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. (soft music) - I'm glad we're finally alone 'cause I don't know. There's just been something I've been meaning to talk to you about and. I guess I just don't get it how you never text me back and like I wake up and I wanna talk to you. I wanna text you. Like I wanna be with you and I feel like you just don't put in that same effort and I get it. Like we're both busy, but like we're always on our phones, and I feel like you can take one short minute out of your day to text me back just to let me know that like you still care about me and we're still together and this is still a thing. Now that we're here finally alone, I just thought I would let it out that this has been bothering me. Yeah. Danny. Hi, did you even just hear a word-- - I can't do this anymore. (machine beeping) - What? - Your hair, your friends, your phone. Your life. I feel like I'm living in a start some drama video where it's all about how many people like our photographs and how we look together. None of it's real, Shauna. None of it. - Thanks for driving me home. - Now I know where you live. It's nice. - Yeah. My dad said he's getting a bigger house when he gets this account or something. Wanna come in and have a drink or something? - Yeah. - Austin. Austin, I'm home. - Playing video game. - Thanks. - [Austin] Shoot. - Did you talk to mom? - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Well, this is Robert. If you need anything, let me know. - Hey, where's your room? - It's back there. - Can I see it? - It's kind of messy. - It's okay. - Okay. So this is it. Nothing special. - I like it. It's very girly. - Yeah. I actually haven't redecorated it
