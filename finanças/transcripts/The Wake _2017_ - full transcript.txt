Hey. You okay? Yeah. We're gonna make it through this, okay? Damn it. What? I forgot to charge my phone. What? You? What's that supposed to mean? It means your phone's always dead. Thank you. What? Well, that wasn't sexist. It's not gonna matter, anyway. You won't get a signal out here. Just turn it off 'til we get home. You can use mine if you need to. Aw, shit. Actually, never mind. Still sexist? Place is nice. Guys, I have a bad feeling about this. You have a bad feeling about everything. Shut up, Ben. You have a bad feeling about going to a wake? I think that's kinda the point. Yeah, well, I had a Ned feeling about the other night, and look what happened. Really, Ashley? Now? Sorry. Look, I don't know why, but... for some reason this feels weird. Look, we'll just go in, we'll pay our respects, and then we'll leave. I'm right here. Okay? Um, uh... Please come in. It's a beautiful picture, Mrs. Stevens. Oh, thank you. He would've been 12 today. What's with all the creepy Asian decor? Ashley... I'm sorry. What was that? Oh, um... You have a beautiful home. So... would anyone like a drink? Yes. Me, too. This way. Want some more? Stop, Tyler! Seriously! - I'm fine? - You're not fine. Pay attention! Hey! Tyler! Seriously. Come on. Tyler! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Hit a fucking kid?! I didn't see him! Where did he come from?! I don't... Oh, my god. - Is he...? - He's not alive. He's not alive. I wasn't sure what kind of drinks would be appropriate, so I got a little bit of everything. Uh, what would you like? I'll have whatever you're having. Me too. Same. Yeah. How 'bout you? What they all said. All right, well, champagne it is. Does anyone else find it weird that we're the only ones here? That's not true. They're here. Well, yeah, but... It's a wake. Nobody wants to be here. Something's not right. Guys, I wanna thank you, you know, for being here. Of course, man. You act like you were the only one who was there that night. I know, but... You weren't. Be right back. Okay. Ms. Stevens? Please, call me Nadine. Nadine... What's on your mind? I just-i just wanted to say that... I'm sorry. Thank you. If I could switch places with him... No, don't say that. Everything happens for a reason... and I'm glad you're here. If there's anything that I can do... Everyone's been saying that all day. "If there's anything I can do." I'm sorry, but it's bullshit. Because what can you do? My son is dead. The only thing you can do at this point is bring him back. I wish I could. Would you mind? Of course. To loved ones lost. This is my daughter Caroline. Hi. Hi. Okay, will you excuse me? Uh, there's food out back if you guys are hungry. All right. I don't know about you guys, but I'm starving. - Classy. - What? It's not rude if she offers. She offered, so... I think that's meant for sipping. And when have you ever know me to follow the rules? Never. Which is what I love, by the way. Uh-huh. You know what else I love? Um... that thing I do with my tongue? What? Yeah. Mmh. But sexual innuendoes aside... Oh, that wasn't a sexual innuendo. That was pretty damn straightforward. Are you gonna let me finish? Don't I always? What I was going to say... was that I love you. Are you going soft on me? Oh, I think you know me better than that. Mmh, I do. It's so peaceful out here. What ya thinkin' about? Life. Anything in particular? How short it is. Tyler, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You know, I never realized it until now, but we take everything for granted. We go about living our lives having no idea when our last moments could be. - Nobody knows. - No, but his... It was his birthday today... and instead of blowing out candles, he was buried. - Tyler. - My whole life... I've settled. I've gone by everybody else's rules. And when I die, I wanna be able to say that... I got to do everything I wanted to do. Well, what is it that you wanna do? I know I don't want to spend another day without you. I've known that... For a while now. I've just been too afraid to say it. And I know this is the worst possible time and place... to do this... Are you- are you about to ask me what I think you're about to ask me? Depends. Are you leaning more towards a yes or a no? You can't do that, you have to ask me. Will you marry me? You're proposing to me at a wake? Kinda like a fairytale, right? Some of those fairytales are pretty dark. Sleeping beauty, a guy takes advantage of a girl while she's sleeping... Dark. Poisoned apples? You're stalling. Maybe. So, is that a yes? - Yes. - Yeah? Yes. Yay! Oh, my god. That's gorgeous. It's so gorgeous. Oh, my gosh. But, um, you know saying yes is the easy part, right? Yeah, because now you're gonna have to decide which one of us is gonna be your maid of honor. - Hmm. - No pressure, though. No pressure. Mind if I join you? Sure. I'm Ashley. I'm really sorry about your brother. How did you know him? I didn't really. But I know what you're going through. Then you know that there's nothing you can say to make me feel better. I know. When does the pain stop? It doesn't... not completely. But it gets easier. What do you say we finish our champagne and get outta here? Go celebrate on our own? Sounds good to me. You all right? Yeah, um... I'm just gonna go find the bathroom... and then we can go. Oh, honey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just looking for the bathroom. - Just right here on the right. - Okay. - Do you need help? - Um, no, I'm okay. Thanks. Okay. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler, wake up. Shh! It's me. What the hell happened? What's going on? I don't know, I don't know. I was tied up, too. - Where are the others? - I don't know. Do you remember anything? No. Which room were you in? That one. Tyler. I didn't shut that door. This better be a goddamn joke. Where's ginger? - We don't know. What do you mean you don't know?! We were tied up, too. We don't know what's going on! Are you fucking kidding me? I gotta find ginger. - Wait. - Let go of my arm. - Listen to me, listen! There's someone else in this house. - Who? - I don't know. I'm guessing the same asshole who did this. Good, 'cause when I find him I'm gonna fucking kill him! What the fuck? Who are you? Why are you doing this? Hey, psycho, my friend asked you a fucking question! - Ben, what are you doing? - What? It's a fucking crazy fucker in a mask. Yeah, emphasis on the word crazy. What are you so afraid of? There's only one of him and three... What do you want? He's bluffing. If he wanted us killed, we would've been dead already. Shit. Where did he go? - Fuck this. - Where are you going? I'm gonna go find ginger, and I'm gonna give this asshole a taste of his own fucking medicine. How is that a good idea? It's not a good idea! But until a better one comes, it's all I fucking got! Check your phones. See if you guys get a signal. I don't have mine. I left it in the car. Ben? I got nothing. Of course. Did you hear that? What was that? I don't know, but it's coming from downstairs. - What if it's ginger? - What if it's a trap? Well, there's only one way to find out. - Ben! - He's right. Casey, I'm not taking his side, but we can't stay up here and do nothing. But we do need a plan. I think I have a plan. We get ginger, and we get Ashley, and we get the hell out of here. Well, it is simple and to the point. Thank you. After you. Wait, why am I going first? It's your plan! Which way? Not to be clich?... but we could split up and cover more ground. Really, Ben? 'Cause when has that ever worked? - Hey! - Ever? This way. Mrs. Stevens? Here, give me some light. Ben, watch the door. Oh, my god. Are you all right? What happened? Do you remember anything? I remember she was looking for the bathroom. After that... I don't know. That's all I can remember too. Will somebody please tell me what's going on? What are you guys still doing here? You're welcome. We have no idea what's going on either. We were tied up too. How did this happen? Maybe our drinks were drugged? - That's impossible. - Why? Because I poured your drinks. Guys, it doesn't matter how we got here. What matters is how do we get out? I have a feeling there's something you're not telling me. We're missing two of our friends... and there's someone else in the house. What do you mean someone else? Some crazy fucker in a mask. What? All right, listen. We're gonna get out of here. All right? All of us. I'm so glad Caroline's staying with a friend tonight. Don't bother. The power's been turned off. Seriously? We're gonna need real flashlights, then. Which way? I think I have some flashlights in the garage. This way. Watch your step. I know I have one in here somewhere. Ah, yes. Ah, here you go. What the hell was that? That was the front door. Was that someone coming or going? All right, look. Maybe you guys should both stay here and find a place to hide. What happened to not splitting up? We're not splitting up so we can cover more ground in some huge open space. All right? There's only one way in or out. You'll be able to see anybody coming. But what happens if somebody does come? Start swinging' this, and you don't stop until their guts are all over the floor. Here. I'll do it. Are you sure? Sweetie, I was married for 14 years. Lock the door behind us. - What if they... - Don't. They'll be fine. We all will. Okay? You see anything? No. It's pretty dark. What do you think the odds are that he got bored and left? So not good? No. Okay, what do you think the odds are that we can make it to your car? Seriously? - Fuck! So how the hell are we gonna get out of here, man?! I have a spare key. The one you keep in your car? Yeah. The spare key that's locked in your car? Fuck! Wait. What about Ms. Stevens? If they took my key, I'm pretty sure they took hers, too. Maybe she doesn't keep a spare key locked in her car. Did you lock the door? Oh great, so we're just gonna go in the dark, scary room now. "Still think I'm bluffin'?" He's fuckin' with us, man! - We have to get back. - Wait! We can't just leave her like this, bro. There's nothing we can do for her! - Ginger. - I know. Come on. Ashley. It could be them. What if it's not? Tyler? It's me. Why didn't you answer when I asked if it was you? Sorry. I didn't hear you. What did you guys find? What? Ashley, she's, um... Ashley's what? She's dead. No. She can't be dead. I'm sorry. What are we gonna do? We're gonna find ginger and get the hell out of here. - What if ginger... - Hey! Don't. All I'm saying is we have to prepare... We're not leaving here without her! End of story! Really? You're gonna get in her face? What, are you gonna hit her, too? I'm sorry. All right, we're gonna find her. I promise. And we need to borrow your car. Why? Don't you have one? They took my keys... and my spare is locked inside. So your spare key is locked inside your car. Yes, and the irony doesn't escape me, hence why we need to borrow yours. Well, I'd love to help, but my car is in the shop. Besides, it's a two-seater, and there's four of us. Jesus Christ! What else can go wrong? Not a word... From any of you. Anything? Back in the house! Go! Oh! How the hell is the garage door working? - Because he's fucking with us! - What?! Think about it! Why go through all this trouble?! So this is all just a game? Maybe! I don't know! Okay, the real question is why us? What about you? What about me? - Why are you here? - This is my house! Where else would I be? No, not why are you here in this location. Why were you tied up? That's a good question. Tell you what, when you find whoever's doing this, you can ask him. - Guys! Like it or not, we're in this together. Mrs. Stevens, can you think of anybody who'd wanna hurt you? Why do I get the feeling you're not tellin' us everything? He wouldn't go this far. Who? My husband. No, no, no, I though you were... Divorced? No, not yet. He won't sign the papers. - Why not? Because if he did, he would lose everything. Even his holdings at his company. See, my husband is monogamously challenged, especially when it comes to miniskirted secretaries. Do you have any proof? I planted a video camera in his office, and luckily, I removed the tape before he discovered it. Okay, all right. So we can get the tape and use it to get us and ginger out of here. Gee, I wonder why I didn't think of that sooner. Oh, that's right. I don't have the tape. You don't have the tape?! But... Why would I keep it in the first place he would look? Besides, you all should be thanking me. If he had it, we'd all be dead right now. Okay, that explains why you're here, but why us? I don't know, but if I were going to kill someone I'd wanna make it look like anything but what happened. - Where's the tape now? - It's at my sister's. Well, is there any way we can get a hold of her? Do your phones work up here? No. Well, with the power out the landline is useless. Is that music? Where are you going? The music didn't just turn on by itself. Quick! Check the lights! Where's your phone? Right here. It's ringing. Carly, it's me. Call me as soon as you get this. That was her machine. Let me try her cell. What? No. No, no, no, no, no. Not now! Not now! - Oh, shit! - Damn it, dude! - Now what? What is it? They're boot prints. They go that way. Which means we go that way. We're not gonna go that way, are we? Ginger could be this way. Oh, you're gonna play that card, dude? I'm so sorry. I don't see anything. Here. What the fuck? He's gone. How can he just be gone? - I don't know! Maybe you can go out there and find out yourself, huh?! I'm sorry. It's okay. We're all on edge right now. You motherfucker! What do you want?! Ben! Baby! I swear to god, if you fuckin' touch her, I'm gonna fucking kill you! Do you hear me, you asshole?! Ben... No, no. Ginger, baby, can you hear me?! Listen! I'm gonna get you out of here! I promise! I swear to god! Ginger! What are you doing? I'm gonna go out there and fucking get her! What does it look like?! - That's exactly what he wants. Dude, this is my fucking girl, man. What the fuck would you do, man? What if it was Casey out there?! What if it was fucking Casey? What would you do, huh?! Let's go get her. No. You stay here with them. Ben... Look, no offense, okay, but you can't outmuscle him. Neither can I. Okay? But if somethin' happens to me... you've got him. I mean, really... In theory, that shit could work. - Good luck. - All right. He knows what he's doing, right? Let's see you hide in the shadows now, you son of a bitch. I know you're out here! What are you waiting for?! Not so tough without a fuckin' defenseless girl to hide behind, huh?! - Ben? - Ginger! Oh, my god. I thought you were dead. Are you okay? You okay? I just wanna go home. We will. I promise. Okay? Let's go. Oh, my god. Baby, you're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. All right? Hold on for me. All right? I need you to be strong for me. Okay? Can you do that? I love you. I love you, too. Where are you going? I wanna go check on Ben. Be careful. Lock the door. Are you okay? No, I'm not okay. She didn't deserve this, man. She didn't. I want him to suffer. I want him to suffer in more ways than I've wanted anyone else to suffer. I know. Tyler, you're my best friend, man, so no offense, but you don't know. You don't. I just need a minute. All right? Oh, my god. Is he...? No. And Ben? He's okay. He's... He's... Ginger. I'm sorry. Do you have anything to tie him up with? Um, I have some rope in the garage. Hey. Hey! Hey. It's over. It's over. This is all I had. Wait. Are you sure he can't get out? Yeah. Wait, can... Can you just double check? Okay. Have you ever seen him before? No. Maybe-maybe he has an ID on him. No ID, but I have my keys. Okay. So what do we do now? We call the police. We don't need to call the police. Ben! Casey, this piece of shit murdered two of your best friends. You really think that jail's gonna be good enough? And out other option is what? Eye for an eye. You mean life for a life. It's what he deserves, man! Listen to yourself. This isn't you. Really?! 'Cause it feels pretty fuckin' natural to me, man! It's 'cause you're hurting, Ben. Yeah, I'm hurting. A lot. But you know what would make me feel better? And then what? Just go back to living your life like nothing happened? Well, it seems to be working for you. That's different. That was an accident. And no, it's not working for me. You're a grown man, you can make your own decisions. If you feel killing him's gonna bring you some sort of peace... I won't stop you. But is that how you really wanna honor her memory? I'm gonna pull the car up. Wait. Be right back. Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Come on. Fuck! Fuck! What are you doing? Don't worry, I'm not gonna do something stupid. - He didn't mean... - I know what he meant. You're lucky they're here... because if they weren't... I'd gut you like a fuckin' pig... so slowly. I'd make you beg me to kill you. I see you. Ben, stop it! He can't hurt us anymore. Somethin' funny? Stupid girl. So naive. What do you mean? Don't listen to him. He's just trying to get into your head. I'm already in your head. You think this is over? You think you won? This is only the beginning. Beginning of what? You will see. In case you didn't notice, you're tied to a fuckin' chair. I think it's safe to say that... the mistake was that you were underestimating us. Your mistake... Is thinking I am alone. Hello? What's going on? We need to make sure all the other doors are locked in the house. Why? Oh, no. He's right. There are more of them, aren't there? Hey, right now we need to keep them from getting in. Tell them. I'll go lock the other doors. Go! What's goin' on? There are more of them. How many? I said how many! Patience. You'll know soon enough. So what are we gonna do now? Tyler's making sure all the doors are locked. That won't help you. Shut the fuck up! What happened? He got his hands free somehow, man. What do you mean somehow? I don't know! I didn't ask him when he was trying to choke me to death! Hold him. Tyler! Tyler! Are you okay? I don't know. Oh, shit. We need to stop the bleeding. Do you have anything I could use to press against this? Nadine! Just use your tie. Press this on this. It's pretty bad, isn't it? No. You're gonna be fine. Y-you're the worst liar, bro. Listen to me. All right, you're gonna be... You're gonna be fine. It doesn't- it doesn't hurt anymore. Promise me... that you'll kill every... last one of them motherfuckers. Prom... I know this isn't what needs to be said right now, but... we need to figure out how we're going to get out of here. Were you able to see how many were out there? I don't know. Two, maybe three? What about your car? It doesn't work. So we're stuck here? What about their truck? You can't be serious. No, she's right. That's the only way we're gonna get out of here. You can't really be considering that. Right now we only have two options. We can stay here and hold them off for as long as we can, or we can get to that truck... and get the hell out of here. Okay. How do we get to the truck? We first have to get them away from it. And how do we do that? I don't know. There's too many of them. How are we supposed to get to that truck? If I can sneak in from behind, I think I can take one of 'em out. All right, you two stay here. I'll let you know when it's all clear. We have to help him! If you have any ideas, I'm all ears. Hey! That's your plan?! Run! Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Well, it's safe to say they know our plan. We're never getting to that truck now. But they also know that we're willing to fight back. We need to find a place where we have the advantage... and hold them off. You locked all the doors, right? Yeah. Then how are they getting in? That's a good question. What? Why are you looking at me like that? How do they keep getting in, Nadine? - How would I know?! - Tyler, what are you doing? - Did you give them a key? - No! - Did you give them a key? - No! Tyler! Where's this coming from? - You knew about the truck. - Truck? What truck? I was the only one outside, so how could you possibly know about the truck? Are you fucking serious?! How did you know about the truck? I didn't. Lucky guess! Where are you going? Nowhere! I'm going to close the door so no one else gets in. Run! Casey! Casey, wake up! Casey! Casey, wake up! Hello, Tyler. Judging by the look on your face, I'd say you're surprised to see me. How? I saw you die. You saw what I wanted you to see. So, all this is... you? I'm afraid so. Go ahead. You can say it. Say what? That you were right. No? Okay. Why are you doing this? There's someone I would like to introduce you to. Say hello to my son. Jesus Christ! Let's not use that name in here. Little inappropriate, don't you think? You took him from me. My only son. It was an accident. An accident? So it was an accident you had too much to drink that night? And it was just an accident when you decided to drive drunk, killing an innocent boy? Is that what you're saying? You make it sound like I hit him on purpose. Didn't you? You consciously chose to drink as much as you did. And you consciously chose, even though I'm sure some part of you said it probably wasn't a good idea to drive anyway. And not one of your friends stopped you. So, this is all for revenge? Revenge? You think too small. Only in the end does he understand. All of this was orchestrated for this moment. What are you talking about? You didn't find it the least bit odd that I never pressed charges? You never once wondered why you never went to jail? You can't imagine the amount of strings I had to pull. Don't touch me. What are you doing? Getting my son back. Killing me won't bring your son back. 'Course it won't. What, do you think I'm an idiot? I have to kill all of you. If you wanted to kill us, why all the theatrics? Why not just get it over with? Because I wanted to watch you suffer... as you watched everyone close to you... die... one by one. And apparently the occult even has some rules to follow. The ritual has to be held at the coming of the dawn... so I had to keep you here somehow. What's so funny? Do you hear yourself? I mean that literally. Are you hearing the same words that I'm hearing? I wouldn't expect you to understand what a mother would do for her child. Understand crazy? No, I wouldn't. What are you doing? Preparing her body for sacrifice. You can do that all you want. You're not going anywhere. We'll see. Why would you want to leave? After all, you did say you would switch places with my son if you could. I didn't mean that literally. Then what did you mean? Not that. Well then, you shouldn't say things you don't mean. You know, you should be thanking me. I did your son a favor. I think it's time she joins us. Don't you fucking touch her! - Where am I? - Casey... What's going on? I think I'll give you two a moment. Tyler, what's going on? Uh... Well, broad stroking... She thinks killing us is gonna bring her son back. What?! How is killing us gonna bring her son back? Oh... So how do we get out of here? I don't know. My pulling on the chains idea isn't really panning out, so... I'm open for ideas. What are you doing? If I can reach my hairpin... maybe I can pick the lock. Try pulling yourself up. Are you okay? Yeah. I almost had it. I hope I'm interrupting. Grab the candle. If you're gonna sacrifice us... least you can do is tell us what's supposed to happen. And ruin the surprise? I don't think so. There. That wasn't so bad. You know... if we had met under different circumstances... We'd both need therapy? Oh, one more. Shall we? Hic en spiritum. Sed non incorpore. Evokare lemures de mortius. Decretum espugnare. De angelus balberith. En inferno inremeablis. Wa ta Na Siam! Wa ta Na Siam! Wa ta Na Siam! Wa ta Na Siam! Wa ta Na Siam! I... I don't understand. I did everything perfectly. Let's be honest. I think we all knew this wasn't really gonna work. What! My boy! I don't think that's your son anymore. Baby? Hey, freak! That's it. Come on. Do it. Do it! What are you waiting for, huh? - Do it! - Come on! - Do it! - Come on! Run. Run! Tyler. Tyler. Okay, here we go. All right. Sippin', havin' a good time, lovin' life. - Poppin' bottles in the ice. - Poppin' bottles... - Like a blizzard. - In this bitch. Like a... - When we drink we do it right. Come on, you motherfucker. You son of a bitch. Fuckin' hooker. Oh, god. We'll use that. I'm gonna go get fucker! I'm gonna go what? I'm gonna fuckin' what?! All right, take it from the top. Go from the door. Whoa, whoa. What are you doing? I'm gonna go get... argh! One more time. Wh-what are you doing? I'm gonna go g... I'm gonna... I'm gonna go fucking get her, man! - One more time. - Fuck. - All right. - What the fuck is happening? Whoa. Do you need the line? No, I don't need the... All right. Ginger! Fuck. Whoa, what are you doing? Sorry. Don't look at me like that. I'm sorry, dude! So, did you get any good shots? This is video.
