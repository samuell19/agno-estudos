I've already put things in motion, I've changed the will. I've informed the tribe. You'll be doing all this for nothing. It might be for nothing, but I hope you've said your goodbyes.

Go on, you. [barking] Ahh. Tristan. Tristan, open up. Oi! [dog whimpers] Max, wait! Max! Max! [flies buzzing] -Hey! -Oh! You're a dick. What you gonna do about it? What's this? It's what we call a dead kangaroo, mate. Very funny. What happened to it? That I'm not so sure about. Oi, Max, out of it. [whistles] [dog whimpers] Well, whatever it is, I think Mr. Skippy here has skipped his last skip, haven't you, Skip? Welcome to the country, Nick. You having fun? [scoffs] Anyway, I am parched. Good to see you. -Wash your hands or something. -[chuckles] You coming? [dog barking] You got any sparkling water? Some La Croix? -Uh, no, your highness. Got some beer. -Bit early, isn't it? [scoffs] Been here two seconds, you're already telling me what to do. -That's a record, mate. -You'd better take a shower, you grub. [scoffs] So, why did you call me out here? [sighs] Gimme a chance to get my feet up, mate. Please. Right, so, a couple of days ago, I get a letter from Granddad. Here we go. It's marked about a month before he died. Someone must have passed it along to me. Okay, well, why do you need to see me? Oh, don't know. Just thought maybe you might be a little bit interested. Also it's marked to both of us, so... it's not just for me. "Dear Tristan and Nick, hope this letter finds you well." "Sorry I can't be there with you both." "I'm sure you're both growing into good young men." "I made sure you'd get this letter to know my dying wish, that my acres of land are given to the local aboriginal tribe." "They've been a great help with my research and are good friends." "Tristan, I've... Tristan, I've placed the land and decision in your hands." "I trust you know the right thing to do." "Nick, I need you to be there now for others as I was there for the two of you." "I tried to give you boys the life you deserve." "I have every confidence you'll make the best of your situation." "Love you, boys." "Granddad." So, there's this local developer, wants to buy the land off me. Tristan, you understand that Granddad's property has been in the family for generations? -Yeah, I know that. -It's a lot of land, mate. Well, they're willing to pay a lot of money. -How much? -A lot. But it's obviously not what Granddad wanted so I thought I'd check in to see what you think. Well, it's right here, in his own handwriting. It's up to you. Up to me. You drove hundreds of kilometers to tell me that it's up to me. Okay. That's awesome, it was really worth the trip. So glad you came. Thanks, mate. Where you going? Uh, that would be up to me. Just wait. I'll unpack my ute and come help. -[dog barking] -So...? Max, wait... Fine. Bit of manual labor, eh? Look, I'm sorry about in there. I just... I didn't want to tell you what to do. What do you want to do? [sighs] I don't know, Nick. Just... should act like a brother for once. Help me out. Personally, I think you should do what Granddad wanted. Whatever. Oi! [snaps fingers] Come on. -[Tristan groans] -What do you reckon? It's a croc? Yeah. If one magically swam this far down south. Doubt it. [snarling] [barking] [branches cracking, leaves rustling] [barking continues] Come on, whatever killed the roo is obviously sticking around. That's great. [dog whimpers] [contemplative music] [banging on door] G'day. Garvey's the name. You must be Tristan. -I'm Nick, that's... -No, I'm Tristan. -What's up? -Your grandfather spoke of both of you. I didn't expect both of you here today, though. -You expected us-- -No, it's okay. I think I saw you in one of Granddad's photos. Your grandfather was a fine man and a very, very good friend of our people, which is why I'd like to talk to you. -Oh... -Why don't I leave you boys to it, eh? Right. [laughs] You know what, let's just go out this way. So, you got the letter I sent then. Right, so you sent that to me? Yeah, your grandfather asked me to keep it in safe hands until the property could be handed over to the local tribe, and the time's come now. Right. How would you feel about a cash payment instead? 'Cause this developer is willing to give me serious-- You know, the land here, it's part of us, we're a part of it, it's inseparable. You can't take one from the other. It's sacred to us. Like this land that we're on now. Look, your grandfather had great faith in you, son. I know you'll make the right decision. -How about you give me a call when you're ready, eh? -Yep. All right, son. He said he sent us that letter at Granddad's request. And he's gone. Yep. Don't you want some answers? Uh... only if you do. Wanna call him? Thanks for your help, by the way. It was awesome! [Nick] Got any left? Wait, it's not too early for you, is it? That's funny. -[sighs] -[dog whimpers] [owl hooting in distance] Eh, I was thinking before, do you remember that time when I saved you? Hmm? You know, from the kids next door. You were in, like, your sixth. Jeez. That was a while back. Yeah, but they were big kids. All I saw was you flying down the back steps, jumping on the biggest kids' shoulders and smashing him on the side of the head. Yeah, and then I grabbed that cricket bat and just started smashing everyone. Yeah, you always had a lot of fight in ya. Yeah. What did he mean by research? -What? -In Granddad's letter. He said the local aboriginal tribe helped him with his research. I'd be more concerned about what he said about you. You know, the helping others. I have helped others. You know, even Dad helped us after he left. [Nick] Stepdad. You just abandoned me, Nick. Me and Mum. [dog snarls] [creature roaring] What the fuck was that? [branches cracking, trees clattering] [creature snarling] We better go inside. Yeah, uh-huh. [Nick] Max, inside. [dog whimpering] Maxie! Max! [rattling noises echoing] [dog whimpers] [rattling continues] [dog whimpers] [rattling noises echoing] [scoffs] Jesus! [whispering] What's going on? -I thought you were... -What? [rattling noises echoing] [Tristan breathing nervously] You've got the bat. You're older. [scoffs] Fine. [scoffs] [soft clattering] Shh! Hear that? [deep guttural breathing] -[dog barking] -[brothers shout] Fucking dog. [barking stops] [breathing noises stop] I'm definitely crashing with you tonight. As if. [ominous music, insects chirruping loudly] [peaceful music] [dog whining] [grunts] Jesus Christ. Get out of it! What are you thinking? Giant possums? -Yeah? -[horn honks] [honking] Who's this? [folk rock playing on radio] Oh, shit. Fuck's sake. BJ. [music continues] What's this good news? -News? What's-- -You called, remember? Said you sold a heap of my shit. Invited us around to come and have a party. Don't remember calling you, mate. So, what, you didn't sell any of my shit? Yeah, well, I sold some of your shit. I just don't remember calling. But I must have. My bad. All right, okay, all right. Party's on. [contemplative music] Hey-hey-hey! It's fucknut! G'day, BJ. Eh? So, how's life as a sellout treating ya-- [barks] Ah, so this must be the big brother. I'm Bec. Hi, I'm Kate. [giggles] [woman] Hi. Hi. How have you been? Okay.

Either you go and check it out or you stay here with the guy that you said no to, so you wanna try again? He's angry. Atta-boy. Stop it. What you doing out here? [blues song in background] BJ wants to crash out here in the van. Romantic. [sighs] But, seriously, I'm happy for you guys. No, you're not. -What do you mean? -You know what I mean. There was a time you agreed with me. Yeah, well, you made your choices and I made mine. Fair enough. It's good to see you, Anya. -[ominous music] -[distant shrieking] [brush rustles] BJ? Tristan? BJ? [blues in background] You always looked good in this. [man screams] What is that?! [distant shrieking] Hey! What's going on? [man shrieking] That was Jason! That was Jason! Jason! Jason! [Nick] Jason! Jason, talk to me, where are you? [Jason moaning] Shit. You all right? Hey, look at me, you all right? Now, you just had a little too much. -You're fine-- -[vomiting] [Jason coughing, retching] [ominous music] Hey, come on, mate, we gotta go. Get up, we gotta go! Tristan? Bec? Something's happened to-- -You're sensational. Hey, get out! -Sorry, guys. Uh, something's happened to Jason. You better come out. -[Rebecca] Can it wait a minute? -[Tristan] Maybe two? Uh, I guess. Uh, Nick's out looking for him. He's, um... yeah. How long's he been gone for? [chuckles] A while. Hey, be right back. It's called knocking, you know? Spoilsport. [giggles] You are just... wow. But I like him. Yeah. All right, well... I'm gonna go finish off. [giggles] Ugh. -Is he back yet? -No, neither of them. -You didn't want to go help? -[laughs] What was that? -Jason! -[Jason groaning] What... Jason! [Nick] Okay, ready? -[sighs] -Oh! [laughing] What happened to you? Oh, fuck this crazy voodoo forest shit, BJ. -We gotta get outta here. -He's off his face, he could have seen anything. Did you see anything, Nick? No. Whoa! Wake the fuck up to yourself. Seriously, no more drugs for that man. All right, look, party's over. Let's just get him back inside. [Kate] Thank you for finding him. -Come on, princess. -No. I'm gonna stay out here for a bit. I wouldn't stay outdoors if I were you. Fine. I'm staying in the house tonight. [birds singing, insects chirruping] Hmm. What the hell is this? [insects chirruping, animals calling] Running off? That'd be odd. I live here, remember? You know, you're... you're not what BJ makes you out to be. [scoffs] I'm really not. Hey. I wanna make you breakfast. I got nothing in the fridge, unless you want beer. Hmm-mm. No. So I'm going to go into town with Nick, cook you anything you want, anything in the world, as long as it's eggs and toast. I'd really like that. Last night was great. ♪ Wow! ♪ ♪ Gimme love, gimme love Gimme love... ♪ Ladies first. [Anya] Think he's forgotten he's out in the country.

Absolutely, we'll just stop in on the way back. All right. We'll see you then. Bye. Was that your wife on the phone? Uh, no, that was business. -Was it? -Yeah. -I'm a big boy now. -Oh. Meanwhile, what was that between you and Nick? -Think I saw some sparks fly. -What? Did you...? I'll admit it was nice to see him after ages, but... I don't know. You guys talked it over? Have you? What's there to talk about? I don't know, maybe the fact that you still hate him? What...? I don't hate him. You know, it's like, after Mum and Dad divorced, he could have grown a pair and manned up. No, he started to fuck off to the city instead. And your dad, have you heard from him at all? No. Never really expect it, but at least he sent us money to keep us afloat. Um, are we done here, by the way, or are we gonna keep walking around and around... What? We can't just walk and talk, catch up about life? [rumbling noise] [mysterious clattering, slashing noises] -Shit. -[branches snapping] [noises fade] -[laughing] -What the fuck! How are we doing? -You're such a dick. -What? Don't!

I'm not going to sit around waiting for you to get sick of Anya. I'm done! Whatever! You'll be back! [Rebecca] Fuck you. [BJ] You always come back. Oh, um, that reminds me. Can we stop off at that developer's site office? -He called? -Yeah. Take the money. Yeah? I thought you wanted me to give it to the local aboriginal tribe. I know what I said, Tristan. Jesus, you don't have to bite his head off. What? I'm sorry, I... I just don't want you living out here alone anymore, okay? Oh. Cash money! Where is Bec? Bitch is still down there. When we get home, can you get some new friends? -What are you doing? -Coming with ya. -You all right to stay? -You go then. This is nice, I like what the bulldozers have done with the environment. What's he want to talk to you about? I'm guessing money. Money's good. [scoffs] I wouldn't know. Monday. Monday. Hey, Tristan, it's good to see you again. -Yeah. -Yeah. Who's this guy, your bodyguard? He's my brother. Oh, okay, family. -John. -Nick. Come in. Okay. It's not much, and it's home. Gee, I'm sorry about the flies. It's par for the course, I'm afraid. So, you just have to sign these papers and you can be off to your beach house and surfing your days away. You surf? Uh, no, not really. What about you? You surf? No. Oh, okay, two for two. Well, whatever you do from now on, you, uh... you're going to be doing it in style. And this developer, what's he, uh, gonna be, um... developing? Well, I... I never can answer that with my clients. I mean, he can build a nuclear-powered 60-lane bowling alley, if he's dropping that kind of cash, am I right? Am I right? [chuckles] And, uh, what is, um... what does this bit mean here? [John] Whatever is on the property at the time of sale is owned by the new purchaser. So, what it means is, water tanks, old cars, buildings. Whatever's there, they own it. Okay, cool. Um, that's all sounding pretty good to me, so, uh, I reckon, Nick? I think you should take a day to look at the fine print. Um... [softly] I thought you just said in the car... No, I know what I said. So, yeah, I'll, um, just take a day to think about it and then is it all right if I give you a call tomorrow? Yeah, sure, no, you just take all the time you need. Thanks. What's that? [John] Oh, it's just some aboriginal art. I don't know, I just... I like it as art. I've had it a long time now. Well, I think we're done here. Talk tomorrow, Tristan. Not a lot of construction vehicles here for a, uh, nuclear bowling alley. Oh, don't worry, they're going to be here. Who's worried? -I'm telling you the guy's a bloody liar. -You just met the bloke. Yeah. And I'm almost certain he's been sneaking around the place. -Last night with Jason? -And the night before. -Hey, I bet that sick bastard killed that roo. -Sure, why not? What? A kangaroo? What are you talking about? When city boy got here, we found a roo that had been... well, was dead. But I really don't think that a real-estate agent is gonna be trying to scare off the residents. -Why did he have night vision goggles? -Where? In the boxes he had lying around, you idiot. -I don't know. -Nick, calm down! Fuck it. Last night when I found Jason, I looked up to the bush and there was a dark, shadowy figure with red eyes staring right back at me. I couldn't work out what it was at the time, but the goggles in his office were the exact eyes I saw. Here we go again, you see, where Nick just doesn't tell us shit. That's okay because muscles here is gonna save the day, right? More like save your own skin as usual. The guy's up to something. Think, maybe he's trying to get in your head, get you to sell this place for cheap. Mate, just come back with me tonight, and I'll prove it to you. Yeah, and then what's gonna happen? Pull off the mask and go, "Oh, look, the monster was old man Richards the whole time!" -[Anya] Give it a rest! -BJ was right, you're not a brother. You just think about yourself. Go to hell, Nick, seriously. Fuck me! He's just still mad about you leaving him. Yeah, you think? What are you gonna do about it? I'm gonna go to the study, see if I can find a reason that scumbag Richards would be hanging around. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. -What's up? -Nothing. Just Nick. That's what I've been trying to tell you, brother. Hey, man, what's going on? Ah, not much. Hey, where's, um, Bec? She went for a swim. A few hours ago now. Whoa. Where is she? [water running] -[Jason] Bec! -[Kate] Bec! Bec! Hey! Bec! [Rebecca, voice echoing] Come over. Come follow me. [man screams] When did you last see her? What is this, a fucking interrogation? -When? -Mate, I told you, last time I saw her, she went to the billabong to have a swim. We're gonna have to keep looking for her. I'm gonna go get torches. -What did you do? -Know what, Kate? I don't think I like your attitude. -If you did something, I'm going to the cops. -[chuckles] Well... You weren't like this last night when we were making out. Asshole. That was a colossal waste of my time. Just because we didn't find anything doesn't mean I'm wrong. Are you okay? -Bec's missing. -What? Since when? -Since we left this morning. -Really? If you're going to look for her, take Max with you. Oh, I can take your dog, but you're not coming? Scared of the real-estate man, huh? I'm going to go see him now. Oh. Braver than we thought. Come on, Max. I should go with them. They're going to need some help. Hey, wait, I need your... I need your help. Oh, what the fuck? Jason, I need to talk to you. Last night, I didn't even know-- Anya, the fucknut took the van! Anya's going with Nick. Fuckin' bitch, she knew where I kept my keys. In the ignition. -Buff my shit. -Eat a dick! Hey, guys, shut up for a second, would ya? Now, I don't care what's going on with you guys, but we need to focus on trying to find Bec, all right? -Now, I say that we start looking for her down-- -No, no, no. I'm gonna run this thing so we can get it over and done with. Leave the rat here. -[dog whines] -Mate, I actually had a plan. Look, all I'm trying to do is help you find your girl, bro, but if you don't want my help... [Tristan] Mate, it's not like that. I'm just concerned because it's really easy to get lost, and at nighttime we've got no hope. Plus, Nick decided not to stick around as usual. Well, that's what Nick does best, isn't it? Does it look like anyone's there? Does it look like I have X-ray vision? Can't see any cars. Might just wait a minute, eh? -[horn honks] -Jesus! [whispering] I think the coast is clear. Mm-hmm. Quick, oh, my God. Get in the back, go! -Who is it? -I don't know. [whispering] Stay down. Hi, how are you doing? So, what's a pretty thing like you doing all the way out here? Oh, um, my car's not starting, but, um, thanks-thanks for asking. Do you need help? No, no, no, that's fine. My fiancés on his way. I just spoke to him. Fiancé? Yep. Uh, two months today. Well, I hope he gets here soon. You don't know what's out here. Lions and tigers and bears. Oh, my. Oh, my. My God. Where do you find these people? You okay back there, Detective? [Nick] No. [grunts] I thought yoga was big in the city. -Yeah. -[laughing] I liked your story about the fiancé. Wait, are you and BJ getting hitched? God. No. It is a real engagement ring, though. You kept it. I've regretted that decision every day for the last seven years. When he left us. Who? Sam. -Your dad? -Stepdad. But that bastard took my family for everything it was worth. Someone had to step up, someone had to provide. Tristan was just a kid, and... I know it's no excuse, but I didn't have the guts to look you in the eye. It was a long time ago. I think the rain's stopped. You should probably get in there in case he comes back. I can't believe old slut chops, fucking off with Nick like that. She say anything to you? Just that she was glad to see him. What's that? Just fucks me off. [sighs] Jeez, it's quiet. Yeah, well, it's country, it's supposed to be quiet. I mean, this is really quiet. It's never this quiet. No, I know kangaroos and stuff like that, they can't kill you but they can box you. Seen Facebook, man, those drop bears. Vicious little fuckers with those teeth. [switch clicks] Who the hell is this guy? [dog whining] [distant roaring] BJ did something to her, you know that, right? [Jason] I don't know anything. Seems like you were pretty keen to get down his pants last night. Jason, I said I was sorry. I was drunk, and he made a move on me, like he does every girl. God, can't you see, he's always gonna treat us like shit? He's poison. And you are such a nice guy, but you need to stand up for yourself. [creature snarling] Is that the dog? [ominous music rising] Hey! [creature roaring] [feet pounding, creature snarling] Jesus, Bec! What are you doing out here? We've been looking all over for you. [distorted voice] Come with me. Bec? Come with me. [ominous music] Come follow me. [dog barking] Bec? Bec! Bec! God! Get help! Get some bloody help! [gasping] What's going on? [gasping] Kate! Swim, babe! Swim! Come on, you can do it! [Kate sobbing] Kate! Swim, Kate! Come on! Swim! [Kate shrieks] Kate! [creature snarling] [snarling continues] [snarling fades] -Great help you were. -What was I supposed to do? Didn't have to follow. You know what, BJ, I've just about had enough of you. I listened to your advice, I listened to everything you have to say. May as well listen to this guy, no offense. [pounding on door] [pounding] [pounding] Dad? What's going on here, Garvey? What is this thing? Is Richards trying to scare my brother off the land, is that it? Richards is the least of your problems. You know what's going on, you worked it out. No. That is bullshit. It's not bullshit, son, it's true. We need your help. Hey! You okay? No, I'm not. What the fuck is he talking about? It turns out my grandfather was a cryptozoologist. A what now? Someone who researches mythical creatures. -And he studied bunyips. -[scoffs] -I know it sounds fucking insane. -It does. And you dragged me out here and didn't tell me anything again, and you expect me to believe this fantasy story-- It's not fantasy, miss, it's reality, and if you can stop the domestic, we need to go. Now. Can't believe you lied to me. Actually, I can believe it. I didn't think you were gonna believe me. -Fuck, I don't believe me. -Fuck, I'm an idiot. That scumbag Richards will be hanging around. Is everyone okay? Who the fuck is that guy? Shut up, BJ. Dad, what are you doing here? This reunion's great, but we need to get the fuck out of here. We're not going anywhere. [gun cocks] Hello, Tristan. Okay, what the actual fuck is going on here? Son, you and I need to talk. Your dad, huh? Anything good on? Shit! I'm sure he's fine. If Garvey is telling the truth, that means Richards does have something to do with this. And I bet he's at the property right now. And if Garvey's just crazy? Then Richards is some old creep who likes to play dress-ups. And he's also fucking crazy. Point taken. Okay. I'm sorry I haven't contacted you in years. But why now? And how do you know Richards? This creature... is what killed your grandmother and eventually your grandfather. Now, Mr. Richards wants nothing more than to stop this thing before it can kill again. And I agreed to help because I knew you were out here, son. [scoffs] Okay, well... What was that I just saw with Rebecca coming out of the water like that? And Rebecca is? She's, uh, a good friend of mine. She's, um, this girl that I've been... -Anything else happen? -Well, Nick's out there with Anya, you know, that girl that he was seeing, and Kate, Jason's girlfriend, she just got dragged under the water... -Hey, um... -Don't worry, I'll go back and warn him. If Richards is already there-- Stop worrying about me. You must have a lot of questions. So, it looks like the whole process has been sped up. It's been sped up? It's definitely got one, maybe two. Jesus Christ, Sam. I mean, that's just fucking perfect. Man, we still don't know what happened to Rebecca. Something's not right, man. The thing got Kate. Now all these private military dudes, all decked out and all over us. No ID, no nothin'. There's still one girl left. We can lure it out with that. Okay. But you have to understand, this is years in the planning. Hey... [snaps fingers] You know what this is worth to the company? Who's paying these guys? Where did they come from? What do they want? They test it, they're weaponizing it. Calling it whatever, it's more money than you and I can ever dream of. -Everybody just needs to do their job. -Okay. [ammo clip clicks] -So do your job. -[clip clicks] So have you got any weapons? Yeah. Something is all wrong. These guys... [Richards sighs] So... how would you boys like to be rich? Two ball. Thanks, by the way, for looking out for the family. I really needed it. The support I mean. Obviously the money. Just nice to know that someone cared 'cause Nick didn't. Sure. -Happy to help. -No, I mean it. It was just really good to know that-- Jesus Christ, Tristan, just... give it a rest. Okay. That-a-boy, stay. -So you understand? -Yep. -[BJ] Anya's gonna be safe the whole time? -[Richards] Sure. Kids have been briefed, they're gonna help us out. Tristan, how many vehicles do you have here? I got my old truck, but I don't know where the keys are to Nick's ute. -Oh, that's okay. -And these guns are gonna take this thing down? My men take it down, then they net it. Okay, you guys are just backup, no one needs to be a hero. -Then we find Kate? -Then we'll find Kate and Rebecca. -Dad. -[Richards] Ever shot a gun before? Yeah, video games. What's going on? Come on. I need you to call Anya, tell her she's in great danger. Needs to get back here as soon as she can. Okay, if she's in great danger, then shouldn't I tell her to go as far away as possible? You need to trust me. You owe me this. When the Rainbow Serpent created the Earth, she also created one wise man, Biami. She gave him the power to protect land, tribes and people, and all the animals. One man didn't like this, you see? He went and ate the sacred totem animals. This enraged Biami. Biami decided to punish him. But during their fight, this tribesman took on spirit form. That man became Bunyip. [creature snarls] Bunyip swore vengeance on all the tribes and all the people across the land. His evil spirit infested all the waters and all the billabongs. It would devour anybody who went down there. It would destroy anybody who would try to stop him. Nobody ever could. So this thing, it's still out there? It always is and always will be. That is the way of things. All the tribes and people living under fear of Bunyip, they asked Biami for his help and protection. So Biami decided to cage Bunyip in his gunyah, his home, that water hole, for all eternity. Three women had decided to test Bunyip's power and went down to the waterways. But instead of killing them, devouring them, he gave them the gift of eternal life, making them his forever. They became evil spirits as well. They lurk in the waterways. They lure the other men, women and children, drown them. They allowed Bunyip to travel beyond his gunyah. It's happening once again. Three girls, two already under his spell. Tristan! Kate! BJ! Tristan? [dog whimpers] Max? [door closes] -Hey, sweetheart. -[mumbled protests] Waiting on your fiancé? How's your wedding plan? I've seen your dress-up shop. I don't know what you're playing at, but let me go. Hello, Anya. Sam? Help get this off me. You're Richards' client. Is this the part where you tell me your grand plan? -What the fuck is going on, Dad? -Tristan, help me! -Anya! You okay? -BJ, what the fuck?! Tristan, just shut it! This is called doing what you have to. [BJ] The girl wasn't part of the deal. Yeah, I tend to lie a lot. -BJ, I think you should let Tristan go. -Shut up, man. -Richards! -[Jason] BJ, let him go. Richards, you listening to me? She wasn't part of the deal! -BJ, let him go! -Can we focus? Christ sakes, Richards. Tristan, you and your friends, back in the truck. After all these years of you helping out the family. How could I have been so wrong about you? What help are you talking about? To the right! Ungag the girl. What? [protesting] Feel free to scream. -Get in there. -Jason hit me. Yeah, well, at least one of us is thinking clearly. We'll talk about how you screwed me over later. Shit, shit! -I think we're screwed. -Gotta protect Anya. We need to find Bec and Kate and get the hell out of here. -Good luck. -You too. Lights out. [intense music] [distant whistling] [whistling continues] [bird wings flutter] Here we go. [whistling fades] [creature snarling] [screaming] [creature roaring] [shouting] [shouting] Who's got eyes on it?! [bestial cries echoing] Jesus Christ. It's still here. [blowing hollow tone] [creature roaring] Fire! [creature snarling] Come here. Got you. [creature roaring] You should go back, find Jason. Yeah, yes, I should. It's not holding! Get the tranquilizer. Jase, mate! Jase, are you there, man? [Jason] Am I... Am I still alive? We need to get the fuck out of here. [creature snarling] The Taser doesn't work here, there's not even skin! Get the electricity! [electricity zapping] [creature roars] [Anya] Tristan! Oh, thank God, you're okay! This isn't happening fast enough. And where is Richards? I'm so sorry. I didn't know. Where's Nick? Uh, there was a bonfire and aboriginal man and Richards and there was this suit that looked like that thing. Aboriginal man? Garvey? I think so. [creature snarling] [electricity sparking] [snarling] [Sam] Tristan! Do you see what I've done? I've done more than anyone else could have accomplished. I did more than your grandfather ever did! [Tristan] What have you accomplished? You betrayed your family. You don't know what family is! [creature roaring] I don't think that's what he wanted us to see. Me either! [feet pounding] [gun firing] [creature roaring] -[victim screaming] -[creature roaring] Oh, fuck that! Let's go! Go, get in the truck! [both gasping] Get in, get in! Move your leg! -Great! -Where has it gone?! -[glass shatters] -[creature roaring] -[screaming] -Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit! [creature roaring] Let's go! Move it! Drive! Drive! [creature roars] [laughing] [screaming] Get on! Get on! Come on! Come on! Come on, you can do it! Wait, where are you going? [Anya screams] BJ! Turn around! Turn back! Hey, Bunyip, over here! [creature roaring] [roaring fades] [Richards] Hey, sweetheart. Come on, now. [creature calling] [hollow clattering] [feet pounding] It's okay. [softly] Fucking cockroach. Oh, God damn it. [leaves rustling, branches snapping] [creature breathing] [snarling] [screams] [flesh tearing] [creature snarling] [feet pounding] Stop the car! Stop it! What the fuck, mate! We're going back for Anya! Are you fucking serious? Did you see what that thing just did? -Are you kidding me? -We're only going one way and that's that way! I've had enough of your shit! And we are not leaving without Kate, Bec and Anya, you got it? Now, get back in the truck and turn around! -All right. -Come on! All right, fine! Come on! [feet pounding] BJ! BJ, whatever you do, don't turn around! Go, go, go, go! -BJ! -[creature roaring] Go! Oh, shit! BJ! Floor it! Fuck! [creature roaring] Hang on! -Hold on! -Drive! Whoa! -Hold on! -Shit! -No! -[crashes] [voices fade] [ominous music] [voice echoing] Tristan! Tristan! Jase! Tristan! Oh, fuck. Jase. Jase! [ominous music] You... you stay the fuck away from me. Stay away! -[ominous music] -[screaming] [dog barking, whining] Max. You all right? Trist, you here? Tristan! Anya? Is anyone here? Fuck. Anya? [groaning] [gasping deeply] Hey... BJ. [coughing] BJ? Trist... [groans] -They're gone. -Where is the final girl? She's not the final girl! And he's my brother. If Bunyip completes the ritual, your girl becomes a bad spirit, there'll be nothing we can do, the tribes, anybody. He'll be wreaking his havoc right across the land. And you of all people should know what it's like to give up something you love for the greater good. I played with you nice, let's go! Sam, get off me! -We're running out of time. -[screams] Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh, shh! [ominous music] [BJ] No, no, no, no! No, please! No! [screaming] Tristan! [screaming] -Please! Oh, no! -[feet pounding] [creature snarling, flesh tearing] Come on, wakey-wakey. [Anya groaning] You're okay. Know where you are? [creature roaring] Why are you doing this? A lot of people are gonna pay big money for this creature. You did all this for some money? I've sacrificed everything to get this. I trapped BJ. You girls, you're the bait. I brought Richards in. I killed Clyde. I killed Clyde. Hey, Sam, go fuck yourself. [creature snarling] [Anya straining] This is where we found your grandfather. Did it kill him? Bunyip was there on the night, but... your grandfather died of a gunshot wound. Sam. Son of a bitch. You get your brother, you get the girl, you get the man, it'll give you time. Time for what? Time for me to lure Bunyip back into his cave. [Anya straining] [water rippling] [Anya] Bec! Becca, baby! Take this. And this. Two bits of clay and a stick? Ancient weapons. We use them for ceremony and business like this. Kate! Kate, what should we do? Shit! [creature snarling] [feet pounding] [roaring] It's begun. The ritual. What? How do you know? This way. [creature snarling] Sam. Nick. [Anya gasping] No! Anya! She's already gone, but her death won't be a total waste. [electricity whirring] No, no, no, no! No, don't kill her, don't! Don't! She's already dead. [creature shrieks] [roaring] -[Sam screaming] -[electricity buzzing] [roaring continues] Bunyip, you remember me? [snarling] [in aboriginal language] Anya! [creature roaring] Arrrrr! Come on! Get the girls out. Now! Anya, come on! Shit! -Come on. -Here we go. Come on. Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! [creature roaring] [creature roaring] -Shit! -What's wrong? -Sam's gone. -Oh, great. It doesn't matter. Are you guys okay? We will be when we get out of here. Take this. [creature roaring] We gotta go, now! [snarling] Watch your step. Look after them. -You're not coming? -Tristan's still down there with that thing and Sam. -I can't believe Sam's capable of this. -I can. That's why you left for the city. Meet you back at the house, all right? I love you. Go. Anya, come on! Come on! [creature snarling, feet pounding] Come on! Nick! Trist? Thank God. Are you okay, mate? [weakly] Hanging in there. [chuckles] Are you sure you're okay? -Nick, Nick... -[straining] I knew you would save us... Nick. [creature snarling] It was always you. Let's do that later, okay? Let's get you out. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Shit! -[creature roaring] Come on, man, let's go. Come on. -[gunshot] -[Tristan] Nick! [Sam, laughing] I bet that fucking hurts, doesn't it? Fuck sake! He shot you. Come on, Nick. Better to die in a pool of your own blood than a pool of your own piss. All right, straight down that tunnel is the way out. Anya and the girls will meet you at the house. All right? I'll see you at the house. -[Sam] Come on, Nick! -Are you kidding me? I'm not leaving you like this. This isn't gonna be over until I stop him. You're in no position to-- Tristan, let it go, mate. Please. Just go. Please. [Jason, in distance] Tristan, come on! Nick! We'll see you back at the house, yeah? [groaning] [gun fires] [creature roaring] Come on. [blowing deep, hollow tones] [cave rumbling] Be sure and say hi to your friends. [Sam screams] Where the fuck do you think you're going? [Sam] No! [groaning] [screaming] -[explosion] -Nick!
