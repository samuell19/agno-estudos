Sit down, what are you looking at? What are you doing? Come. Put pressure on it. Will it work? I don't know, it's what everyone else does. I did that when I was young. Thanks, Sleazy Fai. What?

Get soap, don't waste the water. Take a shower and wash our hair. Are you nuts? Faster still. Hurry, master. Exhausted? I'm fine. Rest, don't mind me. Thanks. Why are you hitting me? Ignore me. Rest. That day, we talked about why the bid bad wolf devoured the little pig. That day, we talked about why the bid bad wolf devoured the little pig. And why did he want to devour the second little pig? Let's continue. After I, wolf, ate the first pig, I was sad. And afterwards, I continued to hunt for sugar. And afterwards, I continued to hunt for sugar. I walked on until I saw the next house. I walked on until I saw the next house. I saw the second pig. So then... It's your turn, so then... Yes, I saw the second pig. I knocked on the door. Can I borrow some sugar? Not only did he refuse, he stomped on me too. Not only did he refuse, he stomped on me too. I tried to avoid it and when I kept trying to avoid it, I stomped on him too. He threw a jar of pepper at me. When he throw... Ah-choo... Oh, no! I've blown the second pig's house down. Iran into save him, but I saw that he had been crushed to death by rocks. But I saw that he had been crushed to death by rocks. So, I was full, and didn't want to eat him. But I thought another passing wolf would eat him. But I thought another passing wolf would eat him. But I thought another passing wolf would eat him. Besides, that pig was just laying there. Without refrigeration, he would rot. Without refrigeration, he would rot. So reluctantly I ate him, too. The first bite, the second bite... This meat is very tough. I'll try the waist, one bite... You're dead, don't move. Try the waist, try the neck... Stop it! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Good, beauties! See you tomorrow! Goodbye, Coach Fai. He seems much happier today. I feel that too. Even the way he looks at me has changed. And today, his smile is like Andy Lau's. And today, his smile is like Andy Lau's. Hit the sandbags... Shall I take you to hospital? You look exhausted. Give me one. He's quite good. He's a quick learner. Yes. His strength is his dedication. I see. But he could have done better if I had coached him. But he could have done better if I had coached him. Of course! No question about that. Forget it, you cannot eat that for a while. It's time you learned holds techniques. Yes, but Coach Rock is busy. He's busy teaching Edwin. Take the initiative and ask him. How? You pay every month, he must teach you. Coach Rock. Yes? Qi has become much stronger. You mean, after you coached him, he's much better, right? You mean, after you coached him, he's much better, right? No... I mean, the tournament will start soon. I mean, the tournament will start soon. He cannot do holds. He'd really like you to teach him, but dares not ask. I was just being a busybody. Two-times champion, fight one round with me. Two-times champion, fight one round with me. If you win, I'll teach him. Okay? No, no way. Sorry. Didn't you want to help him? That's right, didn't you? You can do it. Master, are you nervous? Thanks to you. You're welcome, you can do it. If you win, the purse split will change. No problem. Are you okay? Come on, you can do it. Will you teach him? You fell, too. Don't be too calculative. You were like a tank, let's call it a game. We won! Great! Hey! What is it? Don't touch me... Are you injured? Dislocated. Do you need... Don't move. Do you need to go to the hospital? It's habitual. That's it? Don't freak. You'll get yours. Will you please teach me this move? Good. Stop. Come. Forward, more... Good, stop, one, two, three, four. Back. Come back... Right. First, the Omoplata. When you are here, put your chin here. Reach with this arm, grab, straighten... Now you've turned a loss into a win. It's critical that the timing must be perfect. Turn... Why did you only teach him to come out of holds? Time is short. It's more useful to teach that. I'll teach him holds techniques later. He'll be good at them with his long limbs. Good. Edwin, take a break. You train with him. Aren't you teaching him? I taught. But I didn't say I'd train with him. You do the hard work. I have to train with Edwin. Come! Master, this is fun. Care to join? You bring me bad luck. What? What did you do? You kissed me! Sorry. You like this kind of thing? Come on then. When becoming the Ringmaster, you must knock out your opponent to continue. Win 10 rounds and become the champion of this league. And take home $2.7 million dollars! The champion can also enter the next season. People, let the Golden Rumble begin! Get up... Who do you think will win? He's a powerhouse, I think he'll win. But local fighter, Edwin Lo has an okay record. He has some experience and is just fair. Because I don't think he's stable enough. But in these fights, mental state is as important as physical. But in these fights, mental state is as important as physical. Don't get angry in a match. Or you'll forget everything. Look, he's all over the place. He's in trouble. Steady, Edwin. Attack again, now! He had the upper hand. Doesn't matter how advantageous you were. One punch and you're down. So are you going home with this? Or will you continue to rumble? I will continue. Mike has decided to become our first Ringmaster! So, pick your next challenger. Our next challenger is... Lin Si Qi! What is that? Sweet potato dessert soup. I made it for you. That's too good to be true. What do you want from me? Teach me boxing. How do you know I can? Sandy says you're a champion. Why do you want to learn? A fat kid at the school next door bullies me. He even ran after me yesterday. I'm scared. Shouldn't you tell your teacher? Yes, but he still bullies me. I'll teach you some self-defense moves. Always shield your head. When he attacks you, punch him in the gut at a good distance, okay? Punch him in the gut at a good distance, okay? Right. But I don't know if I can hit my mark. No matter what you do, always tell yourself you can do it. You're a champion, of course you can do it. No. I'm terrified every time I get in the ring. But I tell myself, I can do it. And I do. But I tell myself, I can do it. And I do. So have confidence in yourself. Tell yourself loudly, "I can do it!". Now! Yes! I can do it! Louder! I can do it! Great! Keep this confidence. Ready? Fat kid is coming again! One, two, three. No... You horrible girl! You're tricking me! One, two, head down, one, two. One. One, two. One, two, head down, one, two. One, two. The match matters more to the Ringmaster than to you. The match matters more to the Ringmaster than to you. Don't go too close. Get a rhythm going. Find a chance to attack, then retract. Remember, in this tournament, you win if he cannot knockout you in two rounds. You win if he cannot knockout you in two rounds. Rest up. You're young, you can take it. Don't feel rushed. Get into position, then attack. Remember what you are fighting for. And don't be afraid. Once you fear, you lose. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing our latest challenger. He stands at 182cm tall, and weighs 70kgs. This is his first time fighting in an MMA League. Please welcome Lin Si Qi. And his opponent. This man stands at 179cm tall, and weighs 74kgs. In his last fight, he used only one round to knockout his opponent. In his last fight, he used only one round to knockout his opponent. Our current winner, Mike Power! In a backstage interview, Mike said he'll knockout Lin Si Qi in the first half of Round One. This is Lin's first fight. His physique looks good. Without experience, this will be a lesson for him. But he can win by lasting two rounds. 10 minutes inside the ring can be an eternity. From Lin's footwork, he comes from boxing. He's using guerilla tactics with Mike. It's a clever strategy. A neck lock, if Lin cannot free himself, he'll lose. Hang in there! It will be over soon! Hang in there! Stop. Water. He got it, he'll attack you with low kicks now. He got it, he'll attack you with low kicks now. Don't be afraid, don't avoid him. Keep your distance, punch him for every kick. Keep your distance, punch him for every kick. You can't avoid his attacks. Remember. Mike kicked his way through the punch attacks. Next round, Mike will continue his low kicks. Let's see how Lin deals with that. Round Two... Ready... Fight: Stop. Back to your comers. I can still fight. I want to fight. Doctor... Lin looks fine. Will the ref stop the game? If his wound continues to bleed, doctor will judge him unfit and the ref will stop it. Doctor will judge him unfit and the ref will stop it. I hope he's fine, he has great spirit. I'm fine... Doctor says he can continue. Ready? Fight: Ten more seconds, hang in there! Stop. Good job. Great! You won! I won... I bet against you. I'll be! On you next time. All right. A single-yolk mooncake? The government banned them long ago. How did you manage to get it? Social Welfare has to give it to many people. Lucky for the single yolk ones, then. How do you split the yolk? Rock, paper, scissors! The winner picks first. Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! Hurray! You pick first! Hurry! Don't rush me! All right. Rock, paper, scissors! Wrong one... My turn, I pick. This one. Okay, one, two, three! Open! How should we deal with the yolk? It's ours. We treated you to the moon cake. You can have this, too. Dani's mom, we'll each have one. Have you had a spinning lantern made from a can? Have you had a spinning lantern made from a can? How does it spin? Like a washing machine, rolling and spinning. Never! Is it for sale? No, you have to make it. Make me one. Sure, for one mooncake and three breakfasts. It's so expensive. You're not haggling, are you? Make me one, see if it's a good deal. All right... What do you want? Out of my WHY! Sleazy Fai, you think I can't find you here? Sorry, boss. This has nothing to do with them. Repay your loan and it will be fine. You owe me money and hurt my men. They heard the sirens and ran off. The knife at the scene, had someone else's bloodstain and Gwen's fingerprint. Did you see it happen? They thought those two were related to me. And beat them. Maybe in the chaos, he ran into it. How did the girl fall down the stairs? Ching Fai, you must stay in Macau. If we need to, we'll contact you. Gwen Wong. We've notified Social Services. They'll follow up with you. Dani, there's a yolk inside this one. Social Worker Tong. It's all my fault. That's why... That's why my husband left. And my son died. I was in hospital and didn't take care of Dani. I was in hospital and didn't take care of Dani. I'm fine now. Doctor says I've recovered. I can take care of Dani. I am capable of taking care of Dani. I can take care of Dani. Doctor says Dani is fine. She's really fine, don't worry. You're lying. You're a bad guy. I had been in jail. Sorry. I've caused harm to many people. Once you two are okay, I will move out. I really am so sorry. Sorry, Sandy. Loan me your bike, it's urgent. Coach Fai. Do you have time for a bite? It's dawn! I can't eat now! Hurry, please. Mother! Are you all right? Does your head still hurt? My head doesn't hurt, I m fine. Round One is over, let's see. Lin is badly hurt, will it affect his confidence in Round Two? Lin is badly hurt, will it affect his confidence in Round Two? That will depend on his coach. What he says now may turn the situation around. What he says now may turn the situation around. Don't worry, your nose is broken. Master, I can still fight. Hurry, help me. Wait. What? Fix it, hurry. Hang in there. This will hurt. Don't let him hit your nose again. You can't fight him up there. He'll bring you to the ground with a hold. All you can do is defeat him on the ground, in a battle of holds. You can do it, come on. Why would Lin ground wrestle with Alberto? Pitting his weakness against Alberta's strength. Pitting his weakness against Alberta's strength. Harder. Oh, no, he's been tricked! Alberto baits his opponents, rookies will be lured. Other fighters would have surrendered by now. Once again, Lin Si Qi makes a miracle! I think everyone in the audience feels like I do. We all admire his fighting spirit so much. Today was amazing. Lin, next time I'll bet on you! I mean, support you. Fantastic! If Gwen cannot pass her evaluation, is there a way to keep Dani out of a welfare home? Is there a way to keep Dani out of a welfare home? We'll try to contact the father again. See if he'll take her. But if, like last time, we cannot find him, we'll see if others are willing to be her guardian. But both mother and daughter must agree. I'm a Hong Kong citizen, can I be her guardian? Sure, but you must agree to an investigation. Sure, but you must agree to an investigation. Investigation? It's fine, why don't we start over? Gwen... What business is it of yours? Being a guardian is a huge responsibility. Give me some students. I want to coach again. Fai, we've been friends over 20 years. I'll do anything for you. You think you can just coach? That everyone will trust you just like that kid? Qi... Get your stuff into the ring. This evaluation shows your emotional control This evaluation shows your emotional control is much worse than when you last left hospital. The report recommends you return for treatment soon. The report recommends you return for treatment soon. Gwen, for Dani's sake, you must calm down. Miss Social Worker. Have my investigation results come out yet? I'm sorry, Mr. Ching. Because you have a criminal record in Hong Kong. So we cannot grant you guardianship. But Dani doesn't have to go to a welfare home. We've found her father who will look after her. We've found her father who will look after her. Stop it! You're trying to harm me! He didn't want us, don't let him take Dani! You're trying to harm me! He didn't want us, don't let him take Dani! You're trying to harm me! No... Let go of my hand... Ladies and Gentlemen! Our Ringmaster, Lin Si Qi! In the last two games, you struggled to win. But somehow, more people are betting on you. I asked them why. They said they saw your persistence. Why do you have this persistence? During my training, I believe all fighters here have a goal, a hope. I believe all fighters here have a goal, a hope. I joined this match to show one person I joined this match to show one person what he thinks is impossible can be done what he thinks is impossible can be done and I hope he can do it, too. In the match, I may fall, but I will get up. Great! I hope the person you want will see your persistence. Great! I hope the person you want will see your persistence. Ladies and Gentlemen! Our challenger, Lee Zi Tian! Ladies and Gentlemen! Our challenger, Lee Zi Tian! Just look at our challenger Lee Zi Tian. He's an attacker, but kicks are his strength. He's an attacker, but kicks are his strength. Can our Ringmaster take him down? We can only wait and see. Get up. Lin executed a beautiful Flying Arm Bar. But Lee freed himself before the hold was in place. Ringmaster seems unsettled. Lin has improved since his last two games. Lin has improved since his last two games. But he may lose on power. Hang in there. Stop. Qi seemed disorganized in Round One. Is something wrong with your shoulder? Is something wrong with your shoulder? Is master here yet? Don't fret. He sees you fear him. You have the power, get him on the ground and lock him up tight, okay? Don't let him anticipate your moves. How many more patients do I have tonight? Let me check. Doctor. Mr. Ching. What is Gwen Wong's situation? You don't need to wait for her. We're transferring her to psychiatric rehabilitation now. You have two more patients. The patient in Room 5 must fast for surgery tomorrow. The patient in Room 5 must fast for surgery tomorrow. Steady. Ready... Beat Him! Fight! Get him. Right, hang in there. We may have a new Ringmaster this time. From the way this game is looking, Lee may will be Grand Champion. He's losing, if this goes on, his arm will break. He's losing, if this goes on, his arm will break. Shouldn't he surrender? I'm right here. You must stand up. You must stand up. You want me to stand up. I'm already standing up. Promise me you'll stand up, too. You must stand up. "Macau Psychiatric Hospital" "Indemnification, Injury or Death" Don't be afraid. Once you fear, you lose. Are you done? I don't understand why you fight. At our age, we don't need others to understand. At our age, we don't need others to understand. Why does Qi fight? I told him, he must remember why he fights. I told him, he must remember why he fights. He is still a kid. Kids are ignorant. He didn't lose. He did what he wanted to do. Then why do you fight? When I was champion, I thought the world is mine. But the world doesn't wait. All I ended up doing was betraying myself. I tell you MMA can kill. I didn't do anything for over 20 years. I don't want to die without any good memories. I don't want to die without any good memories. I'm worried you'll repeat the kid's mistake. What do I have to lose? Win or lose, it can't bring back anything. I'm like Qi. We just want to do something for ourselves. Actually, I'm terrified every time I fight. But I tell myself, "I can do it". "Hello darkness, my old friend" "I've come to talk with you again" "Because a vision softly creeping" "Left its seeds while I was sleeping" "And the vision that was planted in my brain" "Still remains. Within the sound of silence" "In restless dreams I walked alone. Narrow streets of cobblestone" "In restless dreams I walked alone. Narrow streets of cobblestone" "Beneath the halo of a street lamp" "I turn my collar to the cold and damp" "When my eyes were stabbed by the ï¬‚ash of a neon light" "That split the night" It's sweet potato minced pork porridge. I haven't made it in a long time. How does it taste? Delicious. Our first-ever Golden Rumble has come to an end. Lee Zi Tian has become our first Grand Champion. Tian, are you going to come back next season for the challenges? Why not? Okay, so pick your next challenger. The next challenger is Ching Fai! "No one dared disturb the sound of silence" "Fools, said I, "you do not know" "Silence like a cancer grows" "Hear my words that I might teach you" "Take my arms that I might reach you" "But my words like silent raindrops fell" "And echoed in the wells of silence" Are you all right? Ls everything okay? It's fine... Fai. Fai, he's looking for you. Are you Ching Fai? I'm Dani's father, I need your help. Dani won't go with me. That's normal, you treated them badly. That's normal, you treated them badly. I don't want her to be in a welfare home But you didn't get her after her first incident. Mr. Ching, I cannot explain that much. I know Dani doesn't want to go with me. When Gwen is released, I'll give her back. I just want to make up for my mistakes. Why tell me that? I can't help you. Dani knows you're in a tournament. She said she'll go only after you're done. She said, she can do it only if you can. The first challenger in Season Two, Ching Fai. It's Grand Champion's first match of Season 2. He's fighting Lin Si Qi's master. How ironic. In 1988 and 1989, Ching Fai was the Golden Belt Boxing Champion of Hong Kong. Ching Fai was the Golden Belt Boxing Champion of Hong Kong. He has plenty of competition experience. You're talking about 1988. It may have been a good year for wine, but to a boxer, age and strength are his two worst enemies. But to a boxer, age and strength are his two worst enemies. We'll see if master can avenge his pupil. We'll see if master can avenge his pupil. Hurry Sandy, what are you doing? Coming... Get some wine, our boyfriend is on. He's so strong, amazing. Why would he go in just to be clobbered? That's an old master for you. He's testing the force of Lee's punches. Ching looks to have the advantage. But look at Lee, he is so strong. Punches seem to have no effect on him. Lee has the upper hand, can Ching last? Lee has the upper hand, can Ching last? Hard to say, Lee is draining his strength. Tactically that's correct, don't let him pause. Tactically that's correct, don't let him pause. Protect your head. Fai. Saved by the bell! Ching is lucky. He almost suffered the same fate as his pupil. Will luck be with him next round? Hard to say. Can you go on... Yes. Be careful. Ready... Fight: Ching has allowed Lee to get his back again. Ching freed himself because of his stance. Ching freed himself because of his stance. It gave him time to solve Lee's Head Ram. It gave him time to solve Lee's Head Ram. A beautiful assault! Harder! Get him off! Fai! Tap Out! How did he turn and make that punch? It's truly "The Punch that Changed the World". What an exciting match! Can't imagine a 48-years-old boxer can beat our Grand Champion. Can't imagine a 48-years-old boxer can beat our Grand Champion. This proves where there's a will, there's a way. This proves where there's a will, there's a way. I agree. You... Are you hurt? I did it. So can you, understand? Go back to your father. Don't. Go. Sleazy Fai, I'll be back. Of course. Go. Come stomp on me. What is it, Fai? I've decided not to return to Hong Kong. Take this and repay my debts for me. Repay your debts? Did you rob a bank? Prize money from MMA. You only won three games. I bet on myself all three games, a trifecta. Didn't you? You idiot, you bet against me? Fight again! Sure, after you're dead. I'm serious. Get to work, serious. No, Fai, it will work. In your dreams. It works, Fai. Master. Yes, Champion? There's one move you haven't taught me. As do you... I can't do that. You did well. Again, don't kiss me on the mouth. My kissing skills have improved. Again? I said don't!
