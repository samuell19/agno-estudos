- This is the way they said to do it. - Yeah, let's do it. Hold it up. We've got it. - Ya-ha! We're rich! We're rich! * I always dreamed * That some day it would happen * * That promise my dreams let me see * * But I've still enough dust in my eyes to remind me * * Not even a promise is free * Only one more tomorrow and dust will be memory * * This time it's gonna be sunshine, not rain * * My once in a lifetime and I are together again * * Mm, mm * No reason why I can't touch me some sky * * With fingers the rains have wiped clean * * This time it's me who now carries the key * * To the city of all of my dreams * * Only one more tomorrow and I will uncover * * And finally discover the sunshine, not rain * * My once in a lifetime and I are together again * * Mm, mm * Only one more tomorrow and I will uncover * * And finally discover the sunshine, not rain * * My once in a lifetime and I are together again * - You wouldn't believe it. Try me. - I'm thinkin' about that last girl I banged before we went to Mexico. - Shit, I'd believe it. A week in Mexico, was long enough for me. I could settle for a nice, cold shower. - Yeah. Pretty soon, Alex, all we gotta do is collect the money for that dope and we're gonna be rich men. - Yeah, rich men. You gonna look her up again? - I don't know, with all that money I'm gonna have I may be a little too good for her. - Shit, you're as much of a bum as I am. How far we got? - I told you man, we get the money as soon as we meet the connection. - Oh, let's see, we're about an hour from the border now. And from what the connection said, we got an easy day and a half ride. He wouldn't tell me exactly where the place was, so we're gonna have to make a phone call just before we get there. - But he said the cash would be there. - Alex, you must've asked me that at least 10 times. In a day and a half, we're gonna be splitting $100,000. What was that? - Just a truck by the side of the road. - You keep your eyes open, Alex. - Just in case. - In case what, we're smugglin' dope. Who's gonna shoot at us, Indians? - I don't give a damn who it is, man. Ain't nobody gonna catch us with five keys of cocaine. - Okay, cool it man. Just go back and dream about your chick. Jesus Christ, they're the cops man, what the fuck do we do? - This is the border patrol, come out with your hands up. - Throw it in reverse man, back this thing up! Take the front car, I'll take the back. Move! Alex! Alex, you all right? It's all over man. He's not dead yet. He can't do us any harm. - Okay, go get their guns, will ya? - We just killed four men. You hear me, Ray? We just killed four men! I heard ya! We just killed four pigs, four pigs who would've killed us! - Yeah, but they're-- - They're dead Alex, dead. And the way I count, I took three of 'em myself. What the fuck were you doin' out there, throwin' rocks at 'em? - Listen man, you scared as I was? - See that man, that's fuckin' pig's blood. If I was scared, it would've been my blood, right? - I don't know, I need some time to think. - Jesus Christ. - Knock that crap off. Listen, we gotta unload this dope, then we'll have the bread and we can split. That shouldn't be too hard. With every cop in the state lookin' for us. Probably got descriptions, the whole thing. - Easy man, we gotta be smart, Alex. We just gotta get ourselves a new car. Why don't you snort a little dope, maybe it'll calm you down. - I don't need it, man. - You need somethin'. Hey, hey, give me a cigarette, will ya? - I can't find 'em, we must've left 'em back there. What are you doing? I'm gonna go back and get 'em. There's four dead men back there! I need a smoke. What're you crazy? Maybe, but I'm not stupid. You're so fuckin' paranoid, you'd believe almost anything. Here, have a cigarette, maybe it'll calm you down. Alex, we gotta keep our heads together, man. - I know you're right. I just didn't like what happened back there. - That's the way it had to be, us or them. - I don't know, man, it's just not in me to be a killer. - Oh, shut up! Just shut up. They haven't made a gun that'll kill me. Alex, you better get some sleep, man. We got a long drive before we get to a town. - Just some fuckin' excuse of an old man, diddling his way across the street. - Well, we ain't in the desert, old boy. - Jesus, I got a headache 'bout ready to split me in two. - Must be a guilty conscience from all those pigs you killed. - Lay off, Ray. Let's stop, I gotta get somethin' for my head. - Your sense of humor's gotten better. Killing must agree with you. - It does, now I got a reason for livin'. - We better stop pretty soon or this headache will kill me. - Okay, Tiger, I gotta make a call and let our connection know we're comin' anyway. - In such a big hurry, why didn't you go someplace else? - You can probably get your aspirin over there. I gotta make that call. 'Kay, I'll see you back here then. - I don't want anything to eat - We have potato chips and, uh I don't want anything to, um-- Corn chips, ice cream bars? I know what I want, I want some potato chips. Do you have any potato chips? Yeah. And I think um, no, I don't want that. (conversation muffled by car engines humming) What kind of, what kind of slushes did you say you have? Orange and raspberry. Orange and raspberry. Will you hold this? That's all? Don't tell me you're thinking what I'm thinking. - Could be. Stay here and keep your eyes open. Don't worry, they'll be open. - Hi girls, this guy's a little slow in dealing out his ice cream. That's for sure where's my raspberry slush? - Hold your horses, girls. - No, that's the wrong one. Oh nevermind, I'll take it anyway, how much? - 15 cents. - Thanks. - Where's my lemon slush already? I have to get back to work. - Well if you're in such a big hurry why didn't you go someplace else? - Hey, that's no way to talk to a lady, where'd you get your manners at? - Would you mind your own business. Hey! - Excuse me girls, you'll get your ice cream right away. - Hey! - Now you stay right here, you understand me? - Yes. - Mister, help me, this man's crazy. - You're shittin' me. - No. - No! You just keep your mouth shut and sit right here. Don't make a move. Don't move a muscle. Now what'd you girls want? - I wanted a raspberry slush. - I'm fine. - You're fine, and-- - I want a lemon slush. - A lemon slush. - Call the cops. - Call the cops. - Get the police, that guy is dangerous. - Really, wow, I don't wanna get involved with somebody dangerous, he might cause me physical harm. - Yeah, yeah, I mean no, he's gonna cause me physical harm. - Hey, you move the chair, and I'll jump out, okay? - Sure man. - Oh, god no. - Thanks a lot, see you later. - Bye. Bye. - Bye-bye. - You be real quiet. - Well, it's not electric but we won't starve. - I'll get the stuff out of the car. - Don't sweat it man, we're taking care of that. - You know you people can't do this. - Yeah, it's 24 hour parking. How's your headache? - Much better. - And how's your stomach, killer? - Hey, you gotta let me go. - Fuckin' mouth. Yeah, let's split. - Sit down. Of course not. Who'd get us our ice cream? Here's your money. That's all right. Smile, go on, big one, there you go. Real good. - Ugh. - Yeah, it's all set up, all we gotta do is get there. - Now, now, you nevermind. Just sit there and be a good little boy. - But this isn't my truck. - Will you shut up. - We know it's not your truck, it's our truck. - It belongs to the company, and I have to account for all the mileage. - Aw, well you'll just have to tell 'em that someone stole your truck. - How much farther are we gonna go in this rig? - Just stay on this road, I'll tell you where to stop. - Wasn't anything in the papers, I looked. - Yeah, it's too soon yet, don't worry, we'll be okay. - In behalf of the E.D. Ice Cream Company, I demand that you return this truck. - Alex, speed it up. - This couldn't go any goddamn faster. - I said, speed it up, Alex. - You know, I take it all back, gentlemen, you're welcome to the truck. - Come here, clown, come here. - No. No! No! Help me, ow, oh ow. Somebody's gonna get hurt. Ow! Somebody's gonna get hurt. No, no! Oh no, help me, please. Ow no! No! No! Oh no, help me, somebody help me! Help! - No. - Good, you're learning fast. It's us or them, Alex. - Right. You keep forgettin', Alex you don't have a friend in the world besides me. And I'm your friend 'cause I know how to keep you alive. - Cut the bullshit. - I learned by livin', gettin' stepped on and slapped around. Nobody ever gave a damn about me. I learned the hard way. Your enemy's the man behind the gun or badge, or that asshole behind the desk who's always tryin' to cheat you out of somethin'. Nobody ever gives you a damn thing. You gotta take it. - I've had my troubles. - You're in the biggest trouble you've ever been in right now. And I'm the only friend you've got. Hey, you want some ice cream? - No, I'm not hungry. What'd the connection say? - Yeah. - He said 80,000, cash. - That's less than we agreed on. - That's all the cash he's got. I told him we're hot, so he's gonna arrange to get us out of the country. - We have to. - Oh, fuck! - Yeah. He's comin' up fast, we can't outrun him in this thing. Keep it floored man, we need time. He's gainin'. - Speed it up, man. He's pulling alongside! - Cut him off! Where is he? My side! - Lean forward. I said, lean forward! Move it, I said move it! Look man, you're in this fuckin' thing as deep as I am! - Put that thing away. - Relax. - We can't take anymore chances. We gotta get rid of this heap. Okay, okay, I could take a piss anyway. Next gas station, I'll take a piss and we'll get a new car. - Looks like you got a little chip there. - Oh, that's okay, could you check the oil please? We have a long ways to go. Sure, how's your water? - Uh, you better check that also. Do you want a Coke or anything? - No, I'm fine. - Here's the card, I have to make a pit stop of my own. - We're in luck, there's our new car and it looks like it's gettin' gased up. Why don't you take the car, and I'll go get us some money. - Okay, looks like that we don't need guns in here. Be with you in a minute. - Yeah, when you get the time, fill it up. Nice car you got here, do you get good mileage? - Gee, I don't know. - I guess so. Hey, you don't look like an ice cream man. - I mean, you don't look like a guy that drives an ice cream truck. - I'm not. - Well, me and my buddy are just takin' it down to the shop for an overhaul, you know, kind of a favor. - Do you always do favors for people? - Not always, sometimes I have things other people want. - You must be in demand. - I keep pretty busy. I imagine people keep you pretty busy too. - If I let them, but it's got to be a good offer. I get some. - I guess so, I'm Alex. - Hi. - Hey, you got any maps of New Mexico? Yeah, off to the right. - Thanks. - What're you doin' way out here in that? - Oh, the company's gonna put it in service in another town. - Yes, here's the card. - This is the wrong one. - I'm sorry, he must've given me the wrong card. Here's a 10. - Okay, it's 7.36 including the oil. - Thank you. Hey, what the hell's goin' on? - Just what it looks like, Jack. Now you back up. Alex. - Get in! Stay there if you don't want anyone hurt. - Back up. Keep going. Hold it, right there, hold it. Go on, get on the ground. On the ground, man. - Shut up! - I said, down! - Look, I'm not sure how you wound up in this car, but I'm gonna explain the rules, fast. You shut up, and do exactly what I say, and everything'll be fine. 33 fuckin' dollars, those dudes died cheap. - About a day. We gotta stop when it gets dark. We gotta rest, keep our strength up. You wouldn't want a couple of weak boys taking care of you, would you? What's her name? - Karen. - Karen, I just made up a new rule. You gotta answer all my questions fast. Otherwise you don't pass go and collect your life insurance. - Easy, Ray. - Okay, Alex. Now what's this? Oh my god, I'm downright embarrassed. Is this yours? You know, I'm trying to be friendly. Answer me! - Yes! - Alex, we got a little nympho in the car. - Well, I mean the title of this book is Strange Bedfellows, isn't that right? Yes. - See, even she admits that. - Hold on a minute, now I'm gonna offer the evidence. All right, now let's see, here we are on page six. Christ, they didn't wait long. I'll read from page six. David reached beneath the sheets, with the pale, quivering flesh beside him. Slowly his hand moved along the milky valleys of her body, then he was there. Darlene moaned, as his ridged fingers drove into the moist valley between her legs. Hey, this is turnin' me on. Um, oh what kinda person would read this trash? - I don't know, Ray. - Well I know, the answers are written all over you. You're a horny chick, and that dead piece of turd you had drivin' with you couldn't give you enough. Now don't tell me you're upset about him. Shit honey, you got two guys who can really take care of ya. Well, maybe just one, I'm not too sure about Alex. He's been a little upset the past few days. Alex didn't think that was funny. Don't worry honey, I can take care of you all by myself. You know it's awful goddamn quiet in here! I'm gettin' tired of hearin' myself talk! - So am I, Ray. - Son of a bitch, he's alive and breathing. Well, Karen, it's too quiet in here. I want you to read for me, okay. Here, I, here I'll find you a real raunchy part. A real raunchy part. Okay, here, hold the book. Now why don't you start where it says he plunged his throbbing member. - Maybe she doesn't wanna read. - Oh I think she does. 'Cause if you don't, we're gonna act it out right here. Now read! Go on, read! Read that damn book, right now! - He thrust his throbbing member, I can't do it! - Sure you can. - I can't! - Sure you can, I'll help ya. Deep within her dark wetness. Please. - I told ya, if you didn't read we're gonna have to act it out. I figure you must be a pretty horny chick. You couldn't have gotten laid in let's say the last hour. Oh goddamn, stop it! - Calm down, bitch, I'm just tryin' to make this trip a little more enjoyable for you. - Wow, you got a nice pair, honey. I'm gonna like this. Now get your fuckin' hand down there where it's gonna do me some good. You cunt! All right, come here, you're gonna get yours. - Ray, cool it, man. - Shut up and keep drivin', this bitch is gonna get fucked if it kills her. - Leave her alone, Ray, dammit, leave her alone! Fuck you. What the fuck you want? - Okay man, get out! What the hell do you think you're doing? - I said, get out! - Don't you go anywhere, honey. What the fuck you tryin' to do man, kill us? - Listen man, I'm uptight and wasted. Your fuckin' around with that broad almost ran us off the road. Just leave her alone, we ain't got no time for this shit! - I said, keep your hands off her! - Don't you ever put your fuckin' hands on me again! Listen man, I'm uptight too. I was tryin' to relax. Alex, we gotta stay loose. - Listen man, this shit's gotta stop. - Okay, Alex, I'll keep my hands off the young virgin. Now if she rapes me, that's another story. - I'm not kiddin', Ray. - No, you're not. - I never got a chance to take a piss back at that gas station. You can tell our young virgin she's safe, for right now. - He won't be bothering you anymore. - Maybe, you can say whatever you want to. - It wouldn't matter. - Maybe, it doesn't make any difference. At this point, he doesn't care if you're dead or alive. - I've seen enough killing, I prefer you alive. But if it came down to you or me, it'd be me who stayed alive. - Guess I know where I stand. - It's just the facts. We've done too much killing to die for a stranger. - Or a friend, for that matter. - Ray and I get along fine. I know how far I can trust him, and he knows how far he can trust me. - That's just beautiful. - Yeah, sometimes. But you didn't know today, did you? How far you could trust him. - No, I didn't. - Damn, I needed that. That cactus grew half a foot while I was watering it. You about ready to roll? - Yeah, it's your turn to drive. - That's right. - Okay. Well I see you've been lettin' angel tits here cry on your shoulder. - I guess that's all you're interested in. - No, I wasn't. All I wanna do is get this mess over with. - Well, at least we see eye to eye on one thing. Let's go. That dude's got me worried now. - So he didn't answer the phone, maybe he had somethin' to do. - I was calling him for 15 minutes. So he was out. - Yeah, maybe he was in Paxton gettin' a cake to welcome us. Shit like that isn't suppose to happen, man. I told him I'd call him at nine on the nose. Yeah, it's about 10 miles east of Paxton. We're not goin' near there 'til I talk to him again. - Maybe something's gone wrong. - I don't know, I was suppose to call him and he wasn't there. That's right baby, you keep your ears open. 'Cause from now on you're goin' wherever we go. You'll make a pretty hostage if things go wrong. - So call the guy again in a little while. That's all you can do. - I can kill that prick the next time I see him, he knows we're hot. - Relax man, why don't you snort all of this, it'll do you some good. - No, I need a beer, a nice cold beer. That's what I want, a nice cold bottle of beer. In fact, I want two or three, that and a phone call. - I've never known you to turn down dope. - Listen man, this is our first $80,000 scam. Maybe on the second one I'll be more relaxed. - Don't worry, the guy'll be there. So make your call, and bring back some of that tiger piss too. Don't stick all our profits up your nose, man. - Don't worry, I'm only a social doper. - Don't let angel tits do anything funny here while I'm gone. If I'm not back in an hour, kill her. Just kiddin', sweetheart. I'll see ya. - You didn't offer me any. - Goddamn. You're full of surprises. You know what this is? - Cocaine. - You do have good ears. Ever take this before? - No. - Then why the change all of the sudden? - Because if I don't take something or do something, I'm afraid I'm going to fall apart. You're not as tough as you really try to act. - I'm scared! - Come here. - I'm scared. - Come here. Try this, it'll calm you down. - Well, you won't see God or walk on water, or be able to fly. It'll give you a nice relaxing sensation. Look at me, I'm not foaming at the mouth, am I? - No. All right, what do I have to do? - Well first of all, you put it in a little line. And then, seein' as how I'm a poor dope dealer, we use a $1 bill, instead of a hundred. Roll that up, like this, you got all that? - Yeah. - All right, first of all, you put one end to your nose and one end to the line, and then breathe in real deep. Up to your nose, okay, put it right on the line. Okay, breathe real deep now. Deeper. Little bit deeper. Okay, good, okay now let's try the other one. Okay, other line now, same way, just breathe real deep. Okay, real good, real good. Here, you left a little, open your mouth. - Open your lips. - It's numb, I can't feel anything around my teeth or my mouth. - If you can't feel anything, you can't be scared. - That's right, it's what started the whole thing. Was that your boyfriend in the car? - Yes, I mean no, I, I just met him. We were traveling north for the weekend together. Why did he have to die? - It was just luck, Ray doesn't value human life. - You're not like him, you're different. You're kinder. - I don't know, he sees things differently than I do. Maybe because he's more careful at living. - I'd like to-- - No need, it's just the facts, it's gotta be me and Ray before anybody else. - Just the same, thank you. - You're not trying to use me, are you? - No. - You see, if we can let you go, we will. But if we can't-- - I don't want any ifs or whens or answers, I don't even wanna think about it. - Hey, calm down, you're gonna ruin all that good coke. - Please Alex, help me. - Okay man, don't screw up like you did tonight. Right. Right, the cash is there. Okay man, I'll see ya tomorrow night. You motherfucker. - Uh, yeah. - This is all of it, Al. - Excuse me just a minute. You got enough for a full scale party there, Tom, what are you doin'? - Ah, just celebratin' the TV. - She's gone for the weekend, that's why I'm celebratin'. - Okay, it'll be a dollar 43. Okay, will there be anything else? Yeah, let me have a couple packs of Camels, will ya. - Okay. - And these too. That do it? - Uh, hold on a second, there was one thing else. - I knew it, I knew it, go ahead and get it. - Good evening, Al, where's that fella that was just in here? - He's right back there. Where in the hell did he go? - That storeroom leads to the alley. - Oh! - I oughta blow your fuckin' head off. Why don't you give me a good reason not to. You better answer me. What's that? What's that you said? Noise. Noise. Well that's the right answer. You're pretty smart for a pig. - Oh. - But not smart enough. Hey easy man, relax, put that thing down. He wasn't after me, he wanted the guy that owned that car. Look, I had a talk with the officer and told him where to find the guy, so he's groovy now. - Well what're doin' back there in the first place? - I dropped a quarter and it rolled all the way back. Here, I'll take my stuff. - You owe me a quarter. - Hey, here's that one that dropped and rolled all the way back there. - Thanks. - I'll see ya. You rotten son of a bitch, you have the nerve to pinch me about that shit! - Hold on Ray, I didn't attack her, it just happened. - You lying sack of shit, you got her all doped up! - That's not true! - Bitch, shut up! - I've warned you, get your fuckin' hands off her! Fuckin' hands off her! - No, you shut up! Now while you were in here ballin' your brains out, I was in the closet with a pig. Now that bastard's dead! And if I ever, ever, hear one thing outta you again, I'll drop ya, right where you stand. From now on, you just do what I say. You got that, man? Yeah. - And as for you, bitch, if you even breathe wrong it's all over. I hope you got your rocks off real good, Alex. 'Cause it's gonna be awhile for you. - Yeah, I heard you the first time. - Good, remember what you heard. - We get the hell outta here. We'll sleep off the road, in shifts. Jesus Christ man, she coulda grabbed that gun and shot you. Get your ass outta there. Let's go. Hey, get up. What time is it? - It's time to get movin'. - It gets damn cold out here at night. - Now that was a shame, that's 'cause you didn't have nobody to curl up with. Hey, have a beer. Your lover boy's pissed off. Thing is, he's got you to blame for it. - Go to hell. - Now you better be nice to me, 'cause I'm runnin' this show. And we both wanna keep that body of yours in one piece. - I can tell how concerned you are. - Are we gonna get movin' or not? - Sure Alex boy, I can smell the money already. - Hey, I'm hungry. - I'd like to help you angel, but if we go to town, the next meal we eat will be in jail. - Come on, it's gettin' hot. What's wrong? - Nothin', just trying to remember which way he said to go. - What kinda dealer is this anyway? Who's gonna be way out here in the middle of nowhere? - He's no dealer. A middleman, a drop off point, all he does is pay us off. We gotta get rid of her. She knows too much and she's seen too much. - When we get rid of her, we can let her go, we'll be gone by then. - No way, man, she's comin' with us, then she's gonna leave very suddenly. I'm not lettin' you hurt her, Ray. - I don't give a shit, man. That's the way it's gotta be, if you wanna be alive to spend any of that money. It's all worked out. - Angel tits is gonna take a little helicopter ride with us. Except she isn't gonna be in it when it lands. We go over some pretty rough terrain, and it's a hard landing from 3000 feet. - I'm not gonna let that happen, man. - We've got no choice, I'm not leavin' her here and I'm not takin' her across the border. She's a witness, Alex, the only witness we got. And we can't afford her talkin'. - She'll come with me, I'll be responsible. - Bullshit, man! You're talkin' about my life in her hands. I told you before man, I'd drop you where you stand. You better do some heavy thinkin', Alex. We've been together for a long time. So don't you fuck up now. Think man, we gotta live. What's eatin' you? - I was just wondering how you're gonna sleep tonight. - On a bed of money, on a bed of money, boy. - I heard you had some chickens for sale. - They might be in the barn. Fellas are a little early. You must be anxious to get this over with. - Yeah, you might say that. - We got an early start. Didn't know how long it was gonna take us to get here. - My, what a lovely lady you brought along. Why don't you come inside? Have a cool drink, talk some business. That's what we're here for. Got a lot of hardware in that car. Expect to do some hunting? - No, we finished our huntin'. - Good to hear, man. Gotta keep an eye on our wildlife. Be a shame to have somethin' go extinct on us. Lena, want you to meet some friends. (light, funky music in background) No thanks, maybe a little later. - Sure. - Our friends brought something different. Maybe give you a little taste of it later. - Great, Collins, why won't this thing work? - You're doin' it all wrong, baby, like this. Oh. - Why don't you sit down there uh-- Karen. - That's a nice name. I had a spider named Karen once. - I remember him. - Yeah, Karen. We didn't know if it was a girl spider or a boy spider, but I named it Karen anyway, yeah, Karen. Becky, come here. Becky, we have some special friends. Why don't you get them something to drink. - Okay, we have some Pepsi. - That's fine. - That's some far out lookin' chicks you've got there, man. Anymore like that around? - No, two is the most I can handle. Maybe later you'll find out why. - Yeah I could go for a little ass. - It don't come little, it comes all. You've got something to show me. - Yeah, it's in the car, Alex, you wanna go get that. - Yeah. I'll be right back, you hang in there. - You're doin' all right. - You've got two men to take care of you. While we've only got one for the two of us. - Yeah, but he's all right, he's got what it takes and he knows how to use it. - He sure does. I hear you're bringin' in some coke, that right? Hey, what's wrong? - Listen, you've got to help me. - Wow, you mean you can't handle two men alone? I'll take your place. - No, you don't understand, I'm not with them, I'm a hostage, you've got to help me get away from here. where you gonna go? That's desert out there. - Shit they must be super horny, they've got you worn out. - No, listen, there've been men killed already, I don't know what they're going to do to me. - Far out, what've you been smoking? - Nothing. - Must've been the coke. - It could be. Hey listen, I don't know what your problem is. Smoke some dope, you'd be better off just to grove with it. - Oh, god please. Then he killed the spider with the same spoon. It was all over, green and black. We, we made it stay there with . - Uh-huh. - Oh, maybe a little pixie dust to make us fly. Do you wanna fly with me? - Maybe my friend can help you out. - Okay, be that way. - It's still yours, man. - Our friend here says it's gonna cost us another 10,000 to get out of the country. - Another 10. - No, gentlemen, the price of risk. My boss is your insurance policy, and right now you two couldn't buy it anywhere else. It's not up to me, he makes all the decisions. - Well you tell him to go fuck himself. - Sit down, man and relax. - You're also paying for an extra passenger we hadn't counted on. - Hey look man, she's not goin' very far. - Really, if we did this for every dude who wanted to get rid of excess baggage, these hills would be littered with bodies. It's got to cost. Now if you two gentlemen want to discuss the possibilities, I'll leave. - It's a deal. That makes 70,000 we'll be gettin'. - Exactly, if you've got what I'm buying. - You think we killed nine people for nothin', man? - Easy, friend, I'm sure you'll count the money, so I'll take a look at the merchandise. These full kilos? - Right on. (light, funky distant background music) Alex, why don't you count the money when the professor's finished. - I'm gonna go see if I can't find somethin' to amuse myself. - The helicopter should be here in about an hour. Lena and Becky should keep you happy. - Thanks. Sorry. You about ready to take a little ride? - Don't know exactly, but we're goin'. - Why don't you just leave me here, you'll be free. - Now angel, you know I've come to grow to like you. I think we spend a little more time together, we might become real close friends. - I don't think so. - Doesn't even interest me. - Because you're an animal. - Wow, he really is an animal. - Let me soothe the savage beast. - Well that's the best offer I've had all day. Lena. - That's all right, I can take care of the both of you. Mm-mm. - Very nice, very nice. I know. - Here's your money. - It could be possible you're cutting out $10,000 worth of coke for yourself. - Possible. Also possible that I'll keep 10,000 cash. Or maybe your friend made a deal while you were out of the room, and he's getting 10,000 extra, many possibilities. - Alex! - Don't say anything, just listen. I don't know what's gonna happen, but it's gonna happen fast. - Ray's gonna kill you. And it's gonna happen in the helicopter. - But-- - Now when we get up in the air, make sure you're near something you can hold on to. Someone's goin' out of that chopper, and it ain't gonna be me or you. - What happens if the police catch you, what'll happen to you? - It'd be all over, you don't kill six cops and get away with it. - But they have to take you to trial. - Like I said, it'd be all over. There's no chance, our only problem is Ray. - Get your stuff together, you're going to be leaving soon. - Remember what I said. Get the money? Yeah, right here. - Boy, we are in the money. - Yeah. - I can smell it. Goddammit man, we made it, we're rich. What is it, Collins? - Two police cars, headed this way. Girls, get rid of our stuff. - It'll never land with those two cars coming. - You little fuckin' bitch, get in the fuckin' car, man. - We got nowhere to go. - Shut up and get in the fucking car! - Ray! - Shut up! - Oh my god. - Come on. - We're not, we're not gonna make it, man. - Yes we are. Now y'all get the fuck outta here before I blow her fuckin' head off! - No! - You stay right there, man, or I'll finish her right now. I said I want you outta here or she dies! I said I want you gone! I said I want you gone! I'll count to three. - You can't do this! One! - Let her go! They're gonna kill us anyhow. - Two! She's gonna die! You want her dead, huh? - No! You bastard! Ah! Ah! * I always knew that someday it would happen * * That promise my dreams let me see * * But I've still enough dust * In my eyes to remind me * Not even a promise is free * Only one more tomorrow * And dust will be memories * This time it's gonna be sunshine, not rain * * My once in a lifetime and I are together again * * Mm, mm * No reason why I can't touch me some sky * * With fingers the rains have wiped clean * * This time it's me who now carries the key * * To the city of all of my dreams * * Only one more tomorrow * And I will uncover and finally discover * * The sunshine, not rain * My once in a lifetime and I are together again * * Mm, mm * Only one more tomorrow and I will uncover * * And finally discover the sunshine, not rain * * My once in a lifetime and I are together again. *
