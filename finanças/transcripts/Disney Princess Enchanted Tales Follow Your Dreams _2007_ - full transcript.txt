Hello, everyone. It's me, Princess Aurora. It's nice to see you. I'm so glad you're here. So I have a question for you. Has anybody ever asked you to do something really difficult and you were excited to try, but it just seemed impossible? Maybe you weren't really sure you were up to the challenge? I know. It happened to me, too. Really, it did. You wanna know what I did about it? Well, here. Come this way. It all took place not so long ago at the palace. Well, my dear, we'll only be gone for two days, but you'll be completely in charge. -I look forward to the responsibility. You know, running the kingdom can be quite a challenge-. Papers to sign, the cook, the gardener and the rest of the staff to attend to. Loyal subjects to meet. I'm prepared, Father. -Yes. A little preparation and a lot of perseverance will see you through. I understand completely. -Good. Well, then, duke, have all the arrangements been made for the royal conference? -Yes, Your Majesties. You may rely on me to see that everything remains perfectly intact. Remember, Aurora, you're a princess, after all. Just stick with it, and you'll be fine. She'll be more than fine. She'll be perfect. Thank you. Stefan! Your sash. Uh, what colours are you wearing? Well, let's see. I'm wearing black and gold... No, no, no, no, no! To the royal conference, of course. I don't want our sash to clash. Ah, yes. I was thinking of going with a muted turquoise this year. I debated the turquoise myself, but ultimately favoured the olive green. It brings out the emeralds in my crown, you know. My crown! Stefan! Have you seen my crown? My speech! How about my speech? I can't believe I'll be in charge of the whole kingdom. I know you. You can do it in your sleep, my sleeping beauty. I'll miss you. Oh, Phillip. I'll miss you, too. Before you go to bed tonight, look at the brightest star in the sky and know that I'll be looking at the same star. I will. I promise. Sampson, we're gonna have to work on your timing. Now come on, Sampson. You get him for two whole days. You're just gonna have to wait. Whenever you're ready, Phillip. You should go. Um, ready! I have an idea. I'll throw a royal banquet to celebrate your return. With everything else to manage in the palace? Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. I can do it. And I want to. -Phillip! Coming! Well, Aurora, you've got the keys to the kingdom. Remember all we've told you, persevere, and you'll get through it. I will, Father. Don't worry. Oh, I'm not worried, child. Now, you're sure you packed my speech? Big speech, much pressure. Opening address for the conference. Can't forget that. Goodbye. For the love of monarchies! Where is my sword? Has anyone seen my sword? Never mind. Hoo! Found it. Yes, King Hubert is a force of nature. It's a wonder he didn't forget his head. Well, I suppose I should go inside and commence my duties. Wow. The keys to the kingdom. I've got the keys to the kingdom The world is open wide So I'll just have to walk right up And see what's inside I've got the keys to the kingdom And soon, they will see They gave them to the right one To me Carrots, peas Roquefort cheese Add a little pepper, please Caviar? One more jar Fizzy things to drink Tulips here, lilies there See if you can carve a bear Orange trees, if you please Paint the trellis pink She's got the keys to the kingdom A wonder to achieve The biggest vote of confidence A soul can receive She's got the keys to the kingdom It's keeper I'll be And do her job exceptionally All of these momentous decisions Are they up to me? Of course, I'm royalty But do I have what it takes? What if I make mistakes? I don't know, but I'll start Leading with my heart She's got the keys to the kingdom The palace and the throne We know that she can handle any job on her own She's got the keys to the kingdom Right here in my hand And everything is bound to be grand She's got the keys to the kingdom Her world is open wide She's got the capability to take it in stride She's got the keys to the kingdom It's all up to me I’ll show them what a princess Can be Welcome home, everyone. I do hope the conference was a huge success. Aurora. Oh, my, oh, my. So much to do. Thank goodness we're here. Where should we begin? Begin what? Helping, of course. Oh. Well, thank you all for the offer, but I'm doing just fine. Are you sure, dear? There's so much to do. Oh, trust me. You'll be the first I call if I need assistance. Well, we'll just be a breath away if you need us. Your Highness, I'm so sorry to disturb you, but problem, problem. I have a problem. You must sign, you must sign. There are so many things to sign. Father said there'd be papers to sign. I've been busy with the banquet, but I'm happy to begin. Just hand me the first one to read. -Read? Did you say read? That'd take months. No, no, no, no, no. Reading won't be necessary, Your Majesty. You just need to... sign. I'm sorry, but if I'm going to sign something, I need to know what it says, even if that means taking a little extra time. But we'll never get through them all. Of course we will. We just need to show a little perseverance. Uh... Yes, Your Majesty. Perseverance. No... Oh, my. Duke, are you all right? Oh, yes, Your Highness. Small tumble. Please be careful. I wouldn't want you to get hurt. No, Your Highness. OK, then. I'll take the next document, please. Here you are... Your Highness. Thank you. I'll take the next one, duke. Duke? Why, duke, you're dripping wet. Yes. Just an unfortunate dip in the moat. Not to worry, Your Highness. Here you are. Thank you. Wait. This is King Hubert's speech for the royal conference. I have to get it to him before it's too late. But, Your Highness, we've only just begun. Yes. I'll be right back. I need someone to deliver this. You called, child? Yes, please say you did. Well, yes, I actually do need your help. Here. I need you to take this speech to King Hubert at the royal conference. It's very important. You must hurry. Consider it done, dear. Yes, we'll leave right away. Right away. -Your Highness? We really have a great deal of work to do. In a moment. Come along, Merriweather. -Yes. Yes, as soon as I fix my shoe. You two go ahead. I'll catch up in a minute. All right, but don't dilly-dally. Now, dear, I'm not supposed to do this. In fact, Flora and Fauna would be so angry. But I want you to take my wand. Whatever for? Well, things could get a little too difficult, and you just might need the help. You're very kind, but I'm not going to use it. Even if things do become difficult, I just have to stick with it, and that means no magic. Yes, well, that's fine, dear. You just hold on to it, anyway. But... -Your Highness, please. I have to go. You have to go. Now remember, dear, and this is very important, if you ask the wand to do something, you must be very specific. If you're not and say something like, "Make me dinner", it might turn you into a helping of roasted boar and a side of potatoes. Yes, yes, yes, of course. I understand. Now go. And good luck. I'm sorry. So, where were we? Ah, yes. Ah, there. All finished. I admit it wasn't easy, but I'm proud to say I stuck with it, and that's what matters. Oh. Oh, dear. Oh, I wish they could pick themselves up into a nice, neat pile. Oh, my. I didn't mean... Oh, well... no harm done, I suppose. There you are, my star. Good night, sweet prince. I made it through today. but I must say, I can't wait to see you tomorrow. Oh, maybe just one more time. Make my dress a beautiful ball gown. With a dazzling necklace and matching earrings. And now a jewelled tiara. OK, OK, enough's enough. I tried it. It was fun, but I'm done. Make it my nightgown, please. Make it pink. Good morning, duke. Good morning, Your Highness. I do hope you got enough rest. Yes, thank you. So, how may I be of service today? Today you'll meet with your royal subjects. How exciting. Are there many to see? Not too many, Your Majesty. Ah. Oh, my. Does the king really get through all of them in just one day? Oh, yes, always. Without fail. Well, I suppose you should send the first person in, then. Your Highness... -Your Excellency... My neighbor’s impossible. Me impossible? Your wall is the problem. Before you lived there, my tree was free to grow. Good walls make good neighbours. Except in your case. Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. One at a time. You, good man, you may speak first. Princess Aurora, this man's apple tree reaches over the stone wall between us and drops apples everywhere, attracting the squirrels, bombarding me vegetables! But he's threatening to chop off every leaf and branch that reaches over the wall. That would butcher my tree. Is that what you want? Gentlemen, please. Now let me think. I believe I have a solution. Kind sir, would it be acceptable to you if our groundskeeper groomed your tree so it grows stronger and healthier, but away from the wall? That would be exceedingly generous of you, good princess. Would it be acceptable to you as well? Yes, Your Highness. That would be most appreciated. Excellent. Can we do that, duke? Of course, Your Highness. You just need to fill out the proper forms. Good, then. Consider it done. The proper forms, Your Highness. Goodness. All right. Well, that's one problem solved. Oh, I do hope the fairies have made it to King Hubert by now. Oh, I know I brought my speech! I must've packed it at least five times. Pockets. Maybe it's in one of my pockets. I know. Maybe this one. Or this. Oh. Your Majesty. Everyone is gathered to hear your opening speech. King Alistair respectfully requests that you deliver it in five minutes. -Five minutes?! I mean, five minutes? Of course. It's an honor. I... I'm speechless. Uh... I'm speechless. My speech, I need to find my speech. I can't go anywhere... That couldn't have been five minutes. I'm not ready! Go away! Your Highness, it's us, Flora, Fauna and Merriweather. We have your speech. -My speech! My speech! Don't know how I could've forgotten it. Thank you all so much. Must make a good impression, you know. Everyone who's anyone is waiting. Not a moment to lose. Thank you. And not a moment too soon. I must away. My speech, you know. Well, ladies, we got King Hubert his speech in time. That was a job well done. -Yes, it was. Now let's get out our wands and fly on home. Our wands? Oh, um, uh... Well, I was thinking it's a lovely day for a walk. Who's with me? -Walk? Oh! That's quite amusing, Merriweather. Yes. Don't be ridiculous. Take out your wand and let's go. Aurora may need us. Come on, Merriweather. What's keeping you? Take out your wand. I can't, all right? I don't have it. -What do you mean you don't have it? I was worried about Aurora being on her own, so I lent it to her. Merriweather! Giving your wand away willy-nilly like that. Goodness, the very thought. Here you go, have a wand. It's only the source of all my power and magic. But please take it. Doesn't matter that it could be an utter disaster. Maybe we should all give them away. Wouldn't that be something? Giving Aurora your wand. You have any idea what could happen? I'm sorry. I was only trying to help. And she said she wasn't even going to use it. Besides, what could possibly go wrong? Show the next party in, please. The recent rains have washed away the roads. Weevils are eating my crops. Might the royal colour be changed to maroon and orange? Will there be enough wood and coal for this winter? There's a very odd smell coming from... Your Highness, perhaps we should stop for the day. I'm sure your father would understand. No, no, no. I can do this. I promised I would, and I will. Ahem. Show the next party in, please. Well, you see, Your Highness, the locusts ate my crop, my cow was stolen, my pigs died and a wolf ate my chickens. Oh, dear. I'm so sorry. How may I be of service? Well, I've replanted my crops, but it would be a great help to get some more chickens. Chickens... -Chickens. Yes, you'll need the forms. Of course. Another form. Oh, I'm not sure I can do this anymore, duke. Of course you can. Just stick with it. Perseverance, remember? Oh, dear. It seems we've run out of forms. If you'll excuse me, Your Highness, I'll be back in just a moment. Ah, this is much harder than I thought. Excuse me, Your Highness? Did you say something? No. Uh, no. I was just thinking of a way to solve your problem. Excuse me for a moment. OK, I know shouldn't rely on anything but good hard work, but... OK, wand, I need chickens, please. Lots of little chickens. What are... Oh, where did all these... No matter where. The important thing is they're yours. Bye-bye. Uh, thank you, but, uh, they're a little young yet. Young? Oh, OK. Not a problem. Uh, wand, let's try something else, shall we? Not little chickens. Bigger chickens. Big ones! Duck! Oh, my. Well, I'd say that couldn't have gone better. Speech was a smashing success. Standing ovation, if you didn't notice. We should be home soon. I do hope Aurora's been able to handle everything at the palace. It can be quite a lot. I'm sure she's got it all under control. Please turn the duck back into a farmer. No, a different farmer. No. The one he was before. No, before before. The one he came in as. Uh, thank you, Your Highness, but perhaps I should come back some other time. No, wait. I can do this, I promise. And a princess never breaks a promise. OK, I need pigs, please. Doesn't matter what they look like as long they're normal-sized. Oh. Oh, my. Oh, my... Oh. Hey, that's my dress. Oh, make it stop. No. Oh, I mean make it... Make it go away. No, that's not what I meant. Oh. I knew I shouldn't have used this. I should've stuck with it and not looked for an easy way out. All right, all right. I can fix this. Now please bring back the same furniture, the same farmer and no pigs, only normal-sized brown-and-white, happy, healthy cows. Wha... Ah, oh. Alright, there you go. Cows. Hopefully you can make a very good living with an entire herd. So, if you'll just take them home now... Please. Because I'm done. Your Majesty, I am so very grateful, but I only have room for three cows. I can't take any more than that. If that's all right. Of course. -Thank you so much. Happy to be of help. Oh, what a mess. What am I gonna do with all these cows? Oh, where's that wand? No. Stick with it. Perseverance. I promised not to use this No magic I took the easy way And look at me today I'll figure out what to do Use my head See it through Here and now I will start Leading with my heart I'm so sorry to keep you waiting, but I promise I will get to each and every one of you. And to thank you for your patience, I have a gift for all of you. Who would like a cow? She's got the keys to the kingdom It's all up to me I've shown them what a princess Can be Stop the coach. Cows. A herd of cows. Wh... Where? The throne room, Your Majesty. The throne room? Are you mad? No, no, no, no, not mad. Cows and chickens. And pigs. Pigs, too. Quickly. You must see. OK, then. -Thank you, Your Highness. You're welcome. I did it. See? Look. Cows! But th... there were, Your Highness, cows. Cows and chickens. Huge, huge chickens. And... and... and green pigs. And do you see any of those cows and green pigs now? No, Your Highness. They're gone. All of them, gone. Don't understand. Are you all right, dear? What's all this about pigs and cows? Long story. But l certainly won't be needing this anymore. Thank you. So how did everything go, my darling? It was a total zoo. But I did learn a great deal about perseverance. What was that, Aurora? Well, when something becomes difficult, I must stick with it and not look for an easy way out. Exactly right, my princess. Well, banquet, anyone? Welcome home to my family and friends. While running the castle was exciting and a challenge, it's even better to have you back. Ha-ha. Marvelous job, my dear. Yes. Ha-ha. In spite of the rumors of cows. Ha-ha. And green pigs. Did you know about the green pigs? -And not to mention giant chickens. Well, let's eat, shall we? So... about those giant chickens... I sure learned my lesson. I never should've taken the easy way out by using magic. I guess you could say I, uh, chickened out. But, you know, some things just take hard work. And when you persevere and give it your all, you can always be proud of yourself. It was wonderful visiting with you. See you soon. No, it's never a good idea to take the easy way out. Sometimes you have to work hard to follow your dreams. I know another princess who found that out the hard way. Hey, you found me. Hi there. It's me, Jasmine. You will never believe what just happened. I was trying to do something really important, but it turned out to be really hard, too. And everyone kept telling me to give up. Well, I was determined to show them I could do it. But you know who else I had to prove it to? Myself. It happened when Aladdin and Genie were away for a few days. You see, I... Well, why don't I just show you? Come on. So, Rajah, what does my day look like today? Well, that's not too bad. Oh, dear. Better get started. It looks like it's going to be a busy one. I now declare this rug shop open. Get ready to ride your ship of the desert, your new camel. Oh, right, my portrait. Will you be much longer? Not that I have anything better to do. Princess Jasmine, please try to remain still. Oh, this looks ridiculous. I feel like a... A peacock. I was born to be a peacock, but I got switched as an egg and now look at me. This is all I do, pose at parades and camel shows, smile and wave, smile and wave. Nothing really important or challenging. Next time, I paint a bowl of fruit. I'm not just a peacock princess. I speak seven languages. I can name every one of the 40 thieves. All 40? It's those last three that always stump me... I'm just not living up to my full potential. I could be of real service to the community, helping schools or in hospitals. How about helping me, Your Highness? Everyone is waiting for this portrait. The Daily Scroll needs a picture, and the royal publicist wants a copy for the camel show. I want to do something different. I'll call the royal dressmaker. Ooh. Not with my clothes. With my life. Another satin gown Another rose bouquet Another king, another ring Another boring day I'm gonna sound the call From Mecca to Siam I'm more than a peacock princess I am Yeah, right. -I am! Not quite. I smile, and I wave I wave, and then I smile I sit on one more camel's hump For one more bumpy mile I'm not just one more silk In Daddy's caravan I'm more than a peacock princess, I am. I believe she is. I can find a cure I can help the poor I could soar if they'd give me half a chance When will they get a clue? There's so much that I can do You can knock 'em flat Be a diplomat It's apparent that girl's got talent Send the sultan a royal telegram I'm more than a peacock princess You're more than a peacock princess You're more than -I'm more than A peacock princess I am. You are. -By far. -A star. I am. I'm not getting anywhere talking to myself. I'm going to talk to my father. Ah, Father. Good. I was just looking for you. And it appears you have found me. Can we talk? -Isn't that what we're doing? I need more to do. -Oh, good. There's another camel show tomorrow. -No, more useful things. More challenging. Cutting ribbons at the opening of shops and posing for portraits is not me. Oh, but you do it so well. Father! -OK, OK. So, it's a job you want. -Yes Something meaningful and challenging, of real importance to the kingdom. Ah. I have the perfect job for you. Really? -Something meaningful. Of real importance. Are you sure you're up to it? Yes, Father. What is it? Royal assistent educator. Yes. What will I be doing? What will you be doing? Why, working with your cousin Sharma at the Royal Academy of Young Scholars. And you can start today. Thank you, Father. That's wonderful. Good morning, Hakeem. Princess, Your Highness. And what do we have here? Palace guards have been trying to ride Sahara again. Captain, you know it was my wife, and only my wife, who could ever ride Sahara. I trust Sahara has been teaching them a lesson or two. You could say that. Bring Sahara to me, Hakeem. I have his treat for the day. Hello, Sahara. Careful, Jasmine. If not for this apple, Sahara would never allow even me to get close to him. Oh, isn't he beautiful? If you like featherless type. For me, a horse is a horse. Oh, not Sahara, lago. Sahara was Jasmine's mother's favourite, and every day, I'd come to be reminded of her beauty, of her strength and of her courage. Enjoy your visit, Father. And you enjoy your day with Sharma at the school. Give her my love. Bye-bye. Abu, you're not supposed to be eating Father's figs. Your obsession with figs'll get you in trouble someday. Well, time to go to work. Royal assistant educator to the rescue. Finally, something really important. I can't wait to get started. Oh. Thank goodness you're here. I'm taking a mental health day. If you have any problems, call the guards. And make sure you call lots of them! Hello. I'm Princess Jasmine. But for today, I'd like you to treat me as you would any other teacher. Now, what were you doing before I came in? This way. Heh-heh. Whoo-hoo. Hey, that's mine. Over here. Ready, set, pull! Keep that snake away from Mia. Ah. Keep that snake away from me. Kid pile on Jasmine. All right, you asked for it. It's a kitty cat. Here, kitty, kitty. Oh, Rajah, I give up. It was a disaster, Aneesa. I wanted to show my father I could handle more. What was I thinking? -You underestimate yourself, child. Next time, try treating those children as I treated you when you were that age. Was I that bad? -Not bad. An absolute nightmare. But I learned to stay strong. I didn't give up. It's called perseverance, my dear. I don't know if I can do it. You have to believe you can. You are stronger than you realise. You think? -I know. Be strong. Never give up. Be strong. Never give up. Be strong. Hakeem? What is it? Please, Your Highness, may I speak to you? Of course. I'll be right down. I don't know what happened. And you couldn't wait another hour to tell us? I need my beauty sleep. When did you last see him, Hakeem? -Last night. I closed the stables, and when I arrived this morning, the gate was open, and Sahara was gone. And you're sure you closed the gate? I think so. Oh, if I lose this job... This money helps to feed and clothe my brothers and sisters. You won't lose your job. But you know how your father feels about that horse. And it was my job to make sure the gate was shut. I'll send some men to look for Sahara. He couldn't have gone far. The guards were already kind enough to search this morning. They found nothing. It's no use. No, Hakeem. You mustn't give up. I'll figure it out. I promise. I don't know how, Your Highness. And now I've got to get to school You go. My father doesn't know yet. We'll find Sahara and bring him back before he brings his daily apple. Don't worry. How can I not? Poor Hakeem. And my poor father if he learns the horse is missing. I'm glade I'm not the one that let that horse out. What could've happened? It's just not like Hakeem to leave the gate open. Maybe there's some other clue. The horse is gone. How's that for a clue? Wait a minute. A half-eaten fig. Very interesting. She found a fig. Stop the presses. This isn't just any fig. It tells an interesting story. Doesn't it, Abu? What's the matter, Abu? Does this fig make you nervous? Do you know what happened to Sahara? Abu! So you expect court to believe you're totally innocent. Where were you on the night in question? Iago, please. So, Abu, um... ...where were you on the night in question? Is there an echo in here? Did you see Sahara last night before he disappeared? We want the truth. We can handle the truth. Ooh. -When? When did you last see him? This is gettin' us nowhere. Let's play good cop-bad cop. And I wanna be bad. I'll handle this, lago. Do you know what happened? Can you show us? You can tell us. Nothing's going to happen to you. Objection! What? Ow. Please, Abu. It's important. Eh, the monkey's a mime. Who knew? OK, I can get this. Let's see. Uh, you were hungry. What did I tell ya? I'm a genius at this. Uh, you're reaching for the stars. You're trying to catch butterflies. Uh, you started to pick something. What? What did you pick? Apples? Pomegranates. Oh, I got it. I got it. Watermelons. Figs. You were hungry and were picking some figs. When the tree ran out. So you took Sahara out to the store to get some more, and you parked him in an illegal spot, and he was towed. Dding, ding, ding. What do I win? You were eating a fig, a lot of figs. Then he felt a little woozy, and then, whoa, you went down, and the handle went up, and then... Abu, it was you. You let him out. Guilty, guilty, guilty! We have to go after him. We? We who? You heard Hakeem. The guards couldn't find him. What makes you think you can? I have to at least try. Hakeem could lose his job, and it wasn't even his fault. Now, how to keep Father away from Sahara? I've got it, But how do I keep him occupied? What would I do? You're clever. Just keep him away from the stables until I can find Sahara and bring him home. Oh, Jasmine, I don't know. I'm not good at this kind of thing. Please. You have to try. -But... Be strong. Never give up. Any of that sound familiar? Oh, you always were a good listener. Oh, thank you, Aneesa. Don't thank me yet. Let's go. You're the only one who knows which way he went. You have to come. You're right, Abu. Stay here. When my father learns you're the one who let his prize horse escape, he won't be too mad. -Yeah. Nice knowin' you, pal. Which way, Abu? Oh, dear. Your Highness, excuse me. Uh, please, sir, a moment? Stop! -My goodness, Aneesa. I must talk to you, Your Highness. -Yes, yes? What is it? No, no, no. Not here. Of course... What's wrong with here? Uh, well, uh... Please, in private. You never know who might be listening. Whoa. Jasmine, let's make reality your friend here. You're in over your head. There's nothing you can do. Well, I believe there is. Can't you go any faster? This has got "disaster” written all over it. On second thought, this I gotta see. Hmm... I don't see any hoofprints. Do you, Abu? The wind must've blown them away. We'll just have to keep searching. Well, you see, and then I told the cook that the cinnamon just wouldn't do. But I'm not sure he listened. Aneesa, is there a point to any of this? A point? Yes, a point. You're keeping me from my time with Sahara. Well, I wouldn't want to do that now, would I? Thank you. Ooh-ah. Oh, are you all right? I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be all right? Well, you went, "Ooh-ah". And you don't look so well. Well, I simply said I... I don't? No, not at all. Very tense, in fact. Tense? Well, I feel fine. There you have it. That won't be necessary, Aneesa. I must go see Sahar... That's... That's quite nice, actually. You ready to quit? No. -No? You've been flying in circles for hours. I'm not giving up, Iago. I'll stay out here until I find Sahara. Thanks, Abu. What is it with you two? You've been out in the sun too long. It's called perseverance, Iago. What is it, Abu? An oasis. Good idea. If I were a horse, that's exactly where I'd be. Let's land and check it out. Look. Sahara's tracks. It's Sahara. He's here. I told you we'd find him. What do you want, a medal? Now let's go back and tell Hakeem where he can find him. No. -No? If we leave, he could run away again. What are you gonna do, walk him back on a leash like a great big dog? I'm going to ride him back. -Are you crazy? I was riding horses before I could walk. But this horse has got a lot of nicknames back at the palace, and all of them mean... It's OK, Abu. I can do this. What makes you think that you can ride that horse? I don't know. But I do know that I have to be strong. And to bring him home safely, I can't give up. Fine. Try to ride the horse. But I don't have to watch it. Good luck. -lago. If Carpet comes back without me, tell my father I had to do it, not just for him, but for me, too. Well, I guess I'd better stick around, then, in case I have to give a detailed account. Thanks. I need all the support I can get. It's OK, Sahara. It's OK. Shh. Easy. We're not here to hurt you. I know you're scared And I know what you've been through Look in my eyes Can you see I'm frightened, too? So let's take one step At a time I won't give up That's one thing I swear will be true For it's said by the wise "Keep your eyes on the prize" And I've got my eyes on you It's hard to trust When you've been misunderstood But starting now We'll be treated like we should So let's take this ride Till it's through I won't give up That's one thing I swear will be true And I won't give in I'm stronger than they ever knew Don't try to run 'Cause I'll just be there when you do For it's said by the wise "Keep your eyes on the prize" And I've got my eyes On you I won't give up That's one thing I swear will be true For it's said by the wise "Keep your eyes on the prize" And I kept my eyes On you Show-off. Come on, you two. We have to get back. Move over. It's been a long day. Your Highness. Please. Aneesa, you have kept me from Sahara long enough. But... but I have to tell you something. Surely you can walk and talk. But it's quite important. Well? Uh, yes, well... I... It's just that I, uh... Out with it! -Spider. Spider? Where? Where? Shoulder Large and hairy. Oh. Now it's on your head. Quick, Aneesa, get it off. Get it off. Uh, got it. Enough is enough, Aneesa I'm going to see Sahara, and I recommend you not interfere, or I shall be forced to call my guards. Hakeem, bring Sahara to me, please. Yes, Your Highness, about Sahara... Yes? What is it? He's all right, isn't he? Well... there's something I must tell you. Oh, why does everyone have something they must tell me today? Please just bring me Sahara. Well, Your Highness, I would, but... But? -But... Jasmine? Is it you? What are you doing? Oh, I just thought I'd take Sahara out for a little ride. I hope you don't mind. No one but your mother has ever been able to ride that horse. And seeing you riding him reminds me so much of her. I hope you're not angry. Angry? I couldn't be prouder. My beautiful and very brave princess. Thank you, Father. And clearly, I have underestimated you. Anyone who has the strength and courage to ride Sahara can handle any job my kingdom has to offer. Really? -You may take your pick. Thank you, Father. Thank you. We could build a wing on the orphanage or start a new hospital... -Both are splendid ideas. But there's something I have to finish first. That's Princess Jasmine. She rode Sahara. Good morning, Jasmine. Thank you. Now, where were we? So you see? When you follow your dreams and keep giving it your all, you can accomplish anything, You just have to be strong and never give up. Well, that's all for today. Come back soon, and we'll do it again, OK? Bye. Well, the candles are flickering, and I see our time is nearly through. But as you leave our storybook castle, keep this bit of magic in your heart, always follow your dreams and never give up. And we'll see you back here soon for more of these Enchanted Tales.
