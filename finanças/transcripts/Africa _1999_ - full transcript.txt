(MultiCom Jingle) (upbeat African music) (singing foreign language) (pounding electronic music) (sniffing) - No. - Come on, just a little bit. For old time's sake, come on. Come on. (shutter snapping) That's my girl. - Hey, what's going on? - Shit. Let's go. - Not yet, relax! - Come on. Move. - Shit, Stick, slow down! - I'll be fucked if I let him stand on his nose with me. - Who? Josh! Come this way. (laughing) - You're mad. - Well, we lost him, didn't we? - Let's go back to your place. - Oh... - Come on. - We can talk, catch up. It's been a while. - I don't think so. - Come on. - I don't think we... - Come on, just relax. Come on. You'll enjoy it. - Let it go, Josh. - Bastard. She's not in control. - If you go out there, you are gonna lose a friend as well as a client. - Why do you think I don't know that? (knocking) - Come back later. Okay, okay, I'm coming! What am I doing? (knocking) Where's the fucking fire? - Jesus, you look like shit. - Thanks. Don't look so great yourself. - Well, Kellerman's hooked, just signed the deal. - Oh, great. - Yes, it is fucking great, actually! I've spent weeks making sure it is great! Oh, come on, Vick. This is the biggest contract we've signed all year. - Sorry. - And it's gonna be the last unless you stop taking this shit and sort yourself out! - They're not mine. - Oh, right. I suppose this isn't you either. - Oh, God. - I don't want you seeing him again. - How dare you tell me who I can see! - He's just using you. - Everyone's using me! You're all pulling on me! Mom, Dad, Kellerman, Barbara, all of you! - I'm not doing any-- - You're the worst! Pushing me into a corner, blocking me in! You make me feel like I can't do anything for myself. - Oh, I see, so this is all my fault, is it? - Yes! No. I'm confused, and I need to spend some time on my own. I'm gonna go away for a while. - What, now? And what about Kellerman? - Shoot isn't for four days. That'll give me enough time. I'll drive up. - Okay. If that's what it takes. I'll organize you a car, find you somewhere to stay. - Stop it. You're doing it again. (sighing) Just get me a car, and I'll take care of the rest. I'm gonna go shower. (light African music) (phone ringing) - [Voicemail] The hotel guest you have dialed is not available right now. Please leave a message. - Um, yeah, hi Vick, it's me. You must still be in the shower. Look, I've sorted the car out, so I'll-- Thank you. See you downstairs about, what, half past? Bye. (light guitar music) Oh, for fuck's sake. - Now what have I done? - You're driving across Africa. Think you'll be comfortable? - Keys. See you on Friday. - Yeah. (engine revving) (bright African music) (singing foreign language) - Shit. - Check that, bud. Yeah. - Very nice. - Hey. - Hi. - He's a little shy. - Can you fill it up for me? - Sure, anything else? - Do you sell soft drinks? - Yeah, inside. - Thanks. - Uh, excuse me... Haven't I seen you somewhere before? - I don't think so. - Ah. (ominous instrumental music) - How much? - 10 bucks. (speaking foreign language) (chuckling) - And the gas, how much? (speaking foreign language) Have you got something to say? - I've seen you in those ads. With your leopard-skin panties. - I'm leaving. Do you mind? - Your car's ready. 50 should cover it. (laughing) (phone ringing) - Yeah? Josh. Thank God. - Are you all right? - Yeah, sure I am. Why? - Just sound a bit tense, that's all. No no, course, course. - I'm tired of driving. I'm allowed to get tired, aren't I? - You're sure you're okay? - Nothing's wrong. Don't call me again, okay? I don't need you checking up on me. - Vick? Vicky? (light piano music) (phone ringing) - Fuck you. - Vicky, where are you? I miss you, baby. - Yeah, sure you do. Drop dead, Stick. - Bitch. (phone ringing) - Mr. Kellerman. Sorry. - Everything all right? - Yeah, absolutely. - So, uh, all sorted out for the shoot, yeah? (horn blaring) (tires screeching) (screaming) (coughing) (tense African music) (thunder rumbling) (soft flute music) - [Receptionist] Sorry about that, can I help you? - [Josh] Yeah, are there any messages for me? - Is there a problem? - No, no, just haven't heard from Vicky, that's all. - Sorry, there's definitely nothing here. - Ah. Okay. Thank you. - Didn't she come up with you? - No. Had a bit of a break. See the countryside. - Really? Well, when's she getting here? - Day after tomorrow. - Oh, well then come and have a drink. Can't leave you alone now, can we? - Okay, 'cause it's you. (soft flute music) (gasping) (light guitar music) - Come on, let's go. - Wait. - Stick! (giggling) - Come on. Yes! (loud electronic music) (applauding) - I think you, girl, have got to lose a few pounds or you're going to fuck up my show. - Would you like some help? - Yes please. - Blue suits you. It's... Very slimming. - That's it. Hey. You look absolutely awesome. - Thanks. - You're gonna be a knockout. (upbeat African music) - I'm on. - Knock them out. (applauding) (laughing) (hyenas giggling) - Get away! Go on! Get away! Get away from me! All of you just leave me alone! - [Barbara] She's good. - Yep. She's good, but she's not Vicky. She's not got Vicky's flair. - Yes, well, Vicky's not here, now is she? - Don't worry, she'll be here. - Can I have a word with you? - Yeah, of course. - What's going on? - I dunno. She should be here by now and I'm starting to get worried. - Well, what am I gonna do about the shoot? I'm gonna have to tell Mr. Kellerman. - No, no, no! Don't do that just yet. She'll be here later on. Trust me. - All right. I'll keep this between you and me. For now. (rhythmic African music) (yelping) (screaming) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Josh] Vicky, it's me. - Josh! Josh, are you... - Come on Vicky, don't keep. - [Trish] I see what you mean. - Josh, Vicky is still not here. You put me into a very difficult position. Mr. Kellerman is furious. My professional reputation is at stake! - I'm sorry, but-- - How could you let her go? You let your personal feelings cloud your judgment! - It's not personal. - Oh, come on, Josh. Everybody knows how you feel about her. - Well, I'm sorry. - I thought you were my friend. (wood cracking) - Oh, come on. You can do this. (laughing) - You okay? - Yeah. - What's going on? - I don't know. Something about Vicky. - How old is Miss Young? - 25. - What's your relationship? - I'm her manager. - Is there anyone she might have contacted? - No. - Her parents? - No, I spoke to them. She hasn't called. - Any friends? - She didn't have much time to keep up with friends. - Boyfriends? - No one of any significance. - Great publicity. - Um, sir... This is not a publicity stunt. - It better not be. Okay. Well... - What, that's it? - I'll check the hospitals and the roads, put up a missing persons... And do let me know if she gets in touch. - When will he ever learn? You can't mix business with pleasure. (rhythmic African music) (singing foreign language) - No. No. Please can't let that be real. (laughing) A taxi! - Get a drink? - We could do that. - I'll show you around. - Did you do this? - What if I did? - You and Vicky set this up. - You're grasping at straws, mate. All I did was call the press. Making you a manager's the worst thing Vicky ever did. Until you came along, she was happy. - Look, chum... Parting with you every night and getting coked out of her skull does not equal happiness. (phone ringing) Yeah? Thank you. They found her car. (dispatch chattering) - [Officer] Is this your friend's car, Mr. Sinclair? - Is there any sign of Vicky? - We found some clothing, and there are bloodstains among the rocks. - But if... You think she's still alive? - [Officer] Looking at the state of the car, I wouldn't hold out much hope. - But there's no body, right? - That doesn't prove anything. Like I said, if you were in the car... Animals have no respect for human sensibilities, Mr. Sinclair. Out there, probably injured. - Yes, but you're not just gonna leave it at that, are you? You're gonna bring some people out here, start the search! - I understand that you are upset, Mr. Sinclair, but we've got procedures for these things. - No, you see, I don't give a damn about your procedures. She is alive, so you start searching! Okay, then I'll start searching. - You hold it right there! We don't want to have to look for two people! Leave this to us, we are the professionals, and we know what we're doing. (dramatic electronic music) (singing foreign language) (monkey screeching) - Hey! Get off! Shoo! Get away! Fucking monkeys! Fucking Africa! Fucking car! I'm not fucking dying! (tribal African music) (whooping) (applauding) - Josh? - The police think she's dead. - I am so sorry. - No, I'm sorry. It's all my fault. - But they can't know for certain, can they? Being that a body wasn't found. - Yeah, but there wouldn't necessarily be a body, would there? - If there's a chance, you will look for her, won't you? - The police told me to stay away. Oh fuck it! - Josh... - I had to take charge, didn't I? Can't just leave things alone. - Josh, taking charge is a good thing sometimes. Don't give up, go find her! (upbeat African music) (zebra braying) (light African music) (lion growling) - Shit! (plane whirring) Help me! I'm here! Help me! No! Help me! Oh no! Please help me! (upbeat African music) (growling) - Vicky, come on, you can do it! Come on Vicky! - Daddy, I'm scared! - Come on, you can do it! - Come on, darling, come on! - (laughs) You did it! - I did it, I did it! - Yes, you see? You can do anything you put your mind to. - Well done, darling! - You can do anything you put your mind to! Good girl. See, I told you! (giggling) Oops, go to your mother. (chattering) - Hi Martha. - Josh. - John. - Josh. - I think we should get inside. - Mr. Young, could you please comment on the disappearance of your daughter? Do you perhaps think she's still alive? - Any news? - Not since we found the car, no. - All right, that's far enough. - [Josh] Thank you. - So... What do we do? - Well, um... Well, I've been searching every day since I called you. The police haven't exactly given up, but they're not exactly making much of an effort. They think she's pulling some sort of publicity stunt. Or dead. - They have no positive proof of that? - No. - Well, this isn't a publicity stunt. She wouldn't do that to us. The police don't know her like we know her. If she survived the crash, she's alive. - What was she doing there in the first place? - She needed a break. - In the bush? Come on, Josh. This is Africa. You let our only child wander off into the bush on her own. - I know, I messed up, I'm sorry. Vicky was having some problems. - You saying she was in some kind of trouble? - No, I mean, nothing we couldn't have sorted out. She just needed some space to clear her head. - And you couldn't go with her? - Martha, she didn't want me with her. Look, if I'd have thought she were in any kind of trouble, I would have called you. - Really? - When? (upbeat African music) - [Josh] We should split up, huh? - Yeah. We'll take the line down by the river's edge. Stay in touch by radio. - Right. We'll go that way. - It's not his fault. - Then whose fault is it? Let's go. - Stop. Let's try over there. (light African music) (elephants bleating) - Fuck it. - Try down there. Can you see anything? - No, nothing. - [John] Just trees. - Let's try there. - Yeah, let's go. - Wait here. Find something? - No, just an old fire. - Vicky? - I don't know, mate. Could be anyone's. - Why the hell did you let her come out here on her own in the first place? - I couldn't stop her. She's a grown woman, she makes her own decisions. - You're supposed to be her manager. Her friend. You should have made her let you come along with her. - John, she didn't want me along with her. - Why not? - Because I'm the problem. I'm in love with her. It was me she wanted to get away from. (dramatic instrumental music) Thanks mate, see you tomorrow. - Night, Josh. - Hey, we're gonna find her, Martha. I know we are. Come on, she's a fighter! If the crash didn't kill her, the bush won't, believe me. - Just don't say it Josh, it makes it seem more hopeless! - She's okay, I know it. - You go on up, honey. I won't be long. - We need to talk. Drink? - [Stick] Her publicity's been great. I've milked it for all it's worth. Things are dying down a bit now. - What if she's hurt out there? - Does it matter? I mean, it's working for us. - I thought she was a friend of yours. - George. - Great. - I should introduce you, this is John Young. Vicky's father. This is Barb Craig. - How are you doing? - Mr. Kellerman, working with Vicky. - Hello. - Please, call me George. - And you too, Josh. - This is Stick. - Hi. - Hi. - Any luck? - No, nothing. - Must be hard. I've got a daughter of my own, and God forbid that... Is there anything I can do to help? - I don't think so, I think we've done all we can. - You don't mean that. - I'm sorry... I don't know what else we can do. - Well, we keep looking is what we do. We don't give up on her. She needs us to have faith. See you in the morning? - Thanks, Josh. I'm glad you said that. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - I would not like to be in his shoes. - I'm gonna say goodnight as well. - I'll be in touch. - What they must be going through... - Yeah. - Stick? - Mmm? - You're fired. Shall we? - You can't do that! - I just did! You can keep these. They're tacky and second-rate. But I guess you're good at that. - Fuck! - John. We've lost her, haven't we? - I don't know, darling. I don't know. I guess it's true what they say. Your kids, they grow up, they move on. You hope you can be there for them, but you never know. You never know. - Oh, thank you, God! Thank you! (upbeat African music) I'm gonna make it! I'm gonna make it! (bright African music) - Sorry! Sorry, sorry I'm late. - It's fine. - Damn traffic gets worse every day. - Hi. - Hello. - Can I help you? - Cappuccino, thank you. - Where are your folks? - Packing. - Well, you look great. - Sure. I think you're a bit biased. - No, no, really. Look, we can easily cover that up. - I don't want to cover it up, I like it. I'm quitting, Josh. - Come on, just... Take your time, think about it. Don't worry about Kellerman, he'll wait. - I have thought about it. I've done nothing but think about it. This just isn't for me anymore. - So what are you gonna do? - Anything I like! - Yeah. But without me, huh? - I'd better go. - Vick! I love you.
