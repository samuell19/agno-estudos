Good morning! Morning, Sujith. You could have called me. I slept like a log. That's alright. You had been really busy for the past four days, right? And you had told me that you'd need a good sleep after that. What were you blabbering in your sleep? What? Well, I didn't understand anything. You went silent when I patted you. "Vivekananda High School is the champion in the District ICSE School Athletic Meet." Look, there's a photo as well. Where is your earring? How many have you lost as of now? Hey! This year, I have to give Chamaya Vilakku offerings at Kottankulangara temple. Our wishes will be granted if we give Chamaya Vilakku offering at that temple. My cousin suffered for so long without getting a suitable bride. He got married within a month of making that offering. And he had a kid within a year as well. Miracle, indeed! -Did you find it? -No. Great! Oh Goddess! I'll look prettier than you, dressed up as a woman for the offering. Let go of me, Sujith. -I haven't even taken a bath. -Oh! Who is this? Yes, Kevin. Yes, I have left from home. Hey! Wait a minute. Are you going today? Yes. Give me a call once you are done. I will come and pick you. Okay? Yes, I have left from home. Just wait. I have kept the money for rent over there. -Give it to Babu when he comes. -Okay. Oh, no! My keys! Okay! Bye. Bye. Go on! Bro… A friend told me about a Yunani healer in Malanada. Do you want to go? Bro, they are all frauds. No, dude. Those who went there, have had results. It is original. Do you know what the doctor told us? There are no complications. We just have to wait. Great! Don't end up waiting forever though. It's been four years since you got married. When will you-- Stop it, Kevin. I am fed up of hearing this. Hello, Ramya. Where are you going? -To the casualty wing. -Okay. -Who's that? -New admission. Where is she from? She is from Kottayam. She is single. -Hey! -Sir? A girl named Neethu got admitted here, right? Where is she now? -Neethu… -Can you give us more details, sir? The victim in the Chathannoor case. Oh! She is in C-block, sir. Where is that? -Show it to them. -Okay. She is in the room next to the ICU in C-block, third floor. Okay. Sir… All of you, please clear the room. Sister, please wait outside. Okay, fine. Dear… Is everything okay? If not, it will become really complicated. Read the FIR. Sir? Read it! Complaint of ten year old Neethu, daughter of Ramachandra and Padma, residing in flat no. 702 on the seventh floor of Jyothi Apartments in Chathannoor, Kollam, against 55 year-old Madhavan Iyer, residing in Padinjarethara, Seethar in Akathekkara, Chathannoor, who is the building supervisor. On 1st March, 2022, at 4:00 pm, the accused brought Neethu… to the generator room and tried to get close to her. The girl was wearing a blue frock. The accused sat on an easy chair and made the girl sit on his lap… and inserted his hand inside the girl's clothes. The accused touched the girl's private parts. The girl did not protest at that moment. Sir, please stop. Following which, the accused made the girl unzip his pants and… -then he-- -Sir, please! This is what I meant. If this becomes a case, it's your daughter's life that will be ruined. The court trial, police interrogation, and moreover, the endless questions from the public! You won't be allowed to live peacefully and honorably. What do you say? No, Bro. She's our child, right? Let us listen to Sir. So, what's it going to be? You are withdrawing the complaint, right? Yes. -Sadasivan! -Yes, Sir. Get their signature on a written statement. Sir. Aren't you a little child, darling? You will forget everything when you grow up. Uncle will get you a compensation, okay? Okay? Oops. Come with me. Sir… Sir… I haven't heard anything. Good for you, then! Bro, can you give me the key to the badminton court? Yes, Teacher. You left without locking it yesterday. I had to lock it. What happened yesterday? You seemed really dull. Did you see me? I had opened the gate for you. Okay. Devika! Very nice! Didn't you work tirelessly for four days of the sports meet? Despite that, you woke up and came here today! Hats off to you, Devika! You could have taken the day off and stayed at home. If I were you, I wouldn't have come here for a week. It's a real bumper! All your 12 students got selected for the state meet this time, right? It is all because of your efforts. You'll definitely win the 'Best Teacher of the year' this time. I really wished that it would be me. But I am not lucky enough. Why are you so silent? I don't feel so good. Then why did you come today? Is it because of your commitment? Tracks, badminton, high jump, long jump… Keep holding on to your commitments. I am going for a trip day after, with my family… to Jatayu Nature Park. Are you coming? No, we are going to the island. Oh! No wonder! You were a girl mesmerized by the mountains. Now you just want the dirt, the backwaters… and the island that might get flooded any moment! To heck with you and Kalyani. I was also afraid of all that, before getting married. But Kalyani and Munroe island give a different feel altogether. You will realize it only when you experience it. No, thanks! Your husband is here! Ms. Geetha, all well? It's going great. Sujith, you're looking quite handsome! I need to match up to her, right? Yes, of course. How long is your leave? I've got leave for two days. I had applied for a week. I hope the superintendent shows some mercy. Okay. -Won't Vijay come to pick you? -That's what he said. Oh, God! Please don't ask us to wait. A protest is going on at the island. Won't be nice if we don't make it. -Oh, is it Ms. Kalyani's revolution! -Yes! Carry on then! Bye, Geethu. My dear people, our protest on behalf of the Island Preservation Committee is entering the next important phase today. My revolutionary greetings to all of you who have come here to participate in this protest. This is not an ordinary protest. This is a struggle for survival. Our main speaker for the day is… someone who took a firm stance on the volatile paths of revolution, Comrade Patton Kalyani. In 1980, when the police unleashed a man-hunt in the island, Ms. Kalyani stood firm like a paton tank. I heartily welcome our beloved Ms. Kalyani wife of the immortal martyr, Peringalan Raghavan, and the strength of all our protests. My dear people… I am talking to you, standing on the doorsteps of a massive calamity. People rise up in revolt when they suffocate in hardships and calamities. It is happening here, as well. Uncontrolled sand mining and the erroneous reforms of the ruling class are pushing our island to complete destruction. If this continues, the sea would claim our island… from all sides and our island will be destroyed. Our island will be lost forever from the map of Kerala! Our island… should not be lost. We should not allow that to happen. We will continue to live on this land. We need the rhythm of beating coconut husks and spinning coir fibers. Our children… should be able to sleep and wake up without the fear and anxiety of floods. PUBLIC PROTEST We need to protest for the same. Our voices should awaken those who are sleeping in AC rooms of bureaucratic power. This is a fight for endurance. This is a fight for survival. We must not fail. In the brutal crack-down by those in power, we may be isolated… we may fall… but one day… we will definitely rise! Our clan's protests will win. Our revolutionary slogans… will make the spring of revolution will arise. For that, Comrades, keep your heads high, clench your fists, and come together… as one mind… and march forward. March forward! -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! What happened? Congratulations, dear! It has been so long. God has heard your prayers. -Did you call Sujith? -No. Call him. He will be very happy. I will call him if you can't. No. Are you still thinking about that? Didn't we choose to forget it? Geethu, I tried to forget. I am unable to. You are crazy! You should consult a psychiatrist. When you should be happy, you're thinking of-- How can I be happy? I am burning within! I was leading such a peaceful life. Come on. What is this? Geethu, I want to clear this. Okay. I understand. Won't you be with me? Yes. Hey! What are doing here in the middle of the night? I am setting up my phone. That's good! It's been two months since we bought it. And, is it working? Yes. Aren't you going to sleep? You go to sleep, Sujith. Let me set this up. Okay. Hey! Did you get your periods? No. No? Did you check? Dammit! Check it. You always get your periods on time, right? I was traveling and stressed out as well. Must be late due to that. I have high hopes. Don't forget to have those folic acid tablets. Okay. Devika! That's enough! Come to bed! You were right. The CCTV was not repaired during those two weeks. The server was faulty. We can't find anything. Miss Annie, the social studies teacher at Vivekananda school, is a friend of my husband, Vijay. She got this for me. It has all the details. Hey! I couldn't find anything problematic in it. If what you said is true, it's been over a month now, right? Photos or videos should have come out by now, right? Don't overthink. Nothing will happen. Keep this with you for your peace of mind. Miss Geetha! I'll be right back. Fix me another drink. Dude, she will kill me if she finds out that we boozed in the house! Aren't you ashamed to live, fearing a woman? Dude… A family is… like a parliament. The man of the house should be the Prime Minister. Got it? Yes. Women should not cross the limits set by us. Ask your wife… to learn something from my wife. Does she create any problem? No! You… You can say that. But… I can't hurt her. It's 4:30 p.m. Finish this quickly. She will be home soon. I'll leave now, dude. Don't be mad at me. Nurse Remya? -When did you woo her? -Give it to me. It's been a week since she joined! Go and get me a cigarette. You're such a flirt! -Go on. -Finish it! Hello… Tell me, darling. Yeah, you can call me after 10:00 p.m. Where are the cigarettes? Where did I keep it? Dammit! Varsha fertility care? When was this report taken? My God! Love you too. I will call you later. Dude, add some water! Check it out. Read it! What do you think about it now? That's awesome! I always knew that you could do it. Congratulations! -Hey. -Yes? Is there anything… you want to tell me? No. You don't? No way. There must be something. Tell me. Sujith, go to sleep. I have a headache. Okay. -Hey. -Good night! Be more active! Here you go! Hit it! You are good for nothing. Sujith, come with me. What's the score? Three-nine. I am at nine. And you? Three. Serve it. -Sujith! -Yes. I am going home tomorrow. Why? Mom has fever. I have to take her to the hospital. Fever? I'll come with you then. No, it's okay. You have duty, right? So what? -I will take leave. -No. I will be back quickly. See what happened now, Sujith! SISTER Hello, Sister. Dhanya… I will be there tomorrow evening. Really? Great! Come quickly. Mom, sister is coming here. Is Brother-in-law Sujith coming with you? No. It's just me. Why isn't he coming? I'll tell you when I get there. Should I buy anything from here? Why? Is there any good news? Stop it. Hello? Hello? -She hung up. -She always does that. -How much? -100 rupees. I'm talking about a similar style. Try this. Isn't this Sandeep's house? You mean Akhil's brother? Yes. Is Sandeep home? He was here somewhere. Hey "Tadpole"! I think he is inside. Come. -I'll be right back. -Okay. Hey, Sumi! -Hey, where is Sandeep? -He must be there somewhere. That's enough, brother. -Hey "Tadpole"! -Yes. Someone is here to see you. -Who? -I don't know. Teacher? Oh, God! When did you come? Why? Can't I come here? I didn't mean that. I didn't accept… I mean, expect this. My classmate, Stephy stays nearby. It was her housewarming today. That's when I came to know that your house is in this area. -I thought I will give you a surprise. -So happy, Teacher. -Have some juice. -No, thanks. Okay. Hey, Roshan! Distribute this to everyone. Okay! Where? Whom are you looking for? Where are your friends? What do I say, Teacher? I don't know if they'd turn up. Don't you want to meet my brother? -Yes. -Come. Stop there, you son of a bitch! Where the hell were you all this time? The plumber is here to repair the motor. -Go there. -I will go. -Go, I said! -I will go, Uncle. Oh God! This kid is useless! Teacher, just a minute. You don't mind, right? -Not at all. -In that case, you go inside and meet my brother. I'll be right back. -Go inside. -But Sandeep, I… Bro, please turn to the left. -To the left? -Yeah, look into the camera. -Okay. -Should I move the light? Come on, smile. -Okay. -Okay. -You can stand there. -Okay, nice. Over there. This side! Hey, Suraj! Come on! Stand closer. Okay. -Smile, man! -Look straight! Smile! Nice. -See you. -Okay. -Akhil, give us a bright smile. -Okay. Once more! Okay! Got it! Yes! Should I take the light closer? No! That's great. -Look here. -Come. Just a minute. Come! Look over here, both of you. -Can you lean on the wall? -Okay. Look there. Come on, bro. Is your mom ready, Akhil? Just call her. Rahul, heard that? -Juice? -No, thanks. Do you want it? Over there. Yeah, I saw her. Nikesh, come with me. Just a minute. I want to tell you something. Shall we go there and talk? Over there. Come. Come. This way. Who are you? We don't recognize you. I am Sandeep's teacher. Who are you? I don't know you. -Chavara. -Chavara? He studies in Cheerankavu. How can he have a teacher in Chavara? -No. I am Sandeep's… -Yeah, right! Sandeep's! -Give me your bag. -Hey! My bag! -Check what's inside that bag! -You are-- Renu has sent you, right? -Renu? -Renu? -I'll tell you who Renu is. -Give me my bag. -Move away! I'll slap you! -Sister, what happened? She was sent here by Renu! -Hey! Give her bag back. -The bag-- Sister, she is a teacher I know from Chavara St. Jude's School. She didn't say that clearly. Can you please stop embarrassing me? -What is it? -What happened? -Catch her! -Hey, what happened? Brother, what happened? -Brother! What happened? -What happened, guys? -Tell me. -Brother! Start the car. What happened? -Oh, God! -Start the car quickly! -Bring the car keys! -That Renu has done something to him. Akhil is being taken to the hospital. Where are you? Come here quickly! Come here quickly. Hey, call the police! Oh my God! Hey, I will reach soon. I am leaving now. Where are you? I called you several times. -I am at Cheerankavu. -Cheerankavu? What are you doing there? Do you know what time it is? You could have informed us if you were going to get late. I will explain when I get there. You are really something! Will there be any buses at this hour? I will manage. Hang up! Teacher, I am sorry. I thought that Renu had sent you. Renu… What is the matter? Well, Teacher… Sandeep's Brother and Renu were in love. Oh! Her entire family is vile and rotten, Teacher. They belong to a low caste. Their rotten behavior is not going to change. Isn't that right? When he got a good marriage proposal, Akhil agreed to it. With that, Renu was out of the picture. My dear teacher… do you know how crooked Renu is? She does not think twice before doing anything. He's no less either. He messaged all his acquaintances on Facebook and WhatsApp. We invited only our close relatives for the function. That's when you came there. And we don't know you, right? That stupid Sandeep didn't tell us, either. I thought that you were sent by Renu. I understand. It is okay. You can't blame us for thinking so, right, Teacher? Teacher, you have not left? No. How is your brother? He is fine. He has a small burn behind his left ear. It was an acid attack. It was a close escape. He will get discharged today itself. That girl got arrested. Who's that bitch who did this? Renu's cousin. She is frustrated because she couldn't get a good guy! Oh, no! Teacher, it's really late. I will drop you. No. Why take the trouble? I'll go on my own. No issues. I am going out to buy medicines, anyway. -I will drop you. -Okay. Teacher, won't you come for the wedding tomorrow? Oh, no. I don't think I can. Is that so? Please don't keep this in your mind, dear. -I was mistaken. -It's alright. -Drop her. -Yes. Please come. Nowadays, we cannot say how women revolt. Right, Sandeep? You are right, Teacher. Acid, petrol bomb, gun, henchmen. There are so many methods for revenge! Teacher, just a minute. Yes, Brother. Go to an ATM on your way back. I have to pay some money here. How much money should I withdraw? Get 10,000 rupees. Okay, Brother. You clicked many photos that day, right? -I saved these from your Facebook page. -Okay. Those were memorable days, right? Won't we miss them if we don't click them? Everyone was in a good mood. It was such a great vibe! And as you know, this is the third time… that our school is winning the cup for the sports meet. Why wouldn't you win the cup? Everyone in your team including you, is 19 years old. Those are tricks played by the management. They make us fail in classrooms… and we win cups for them at the grounds. We are comfortable with it. They are comfortable as well. That won't happen in my school. That's why you lost. Where are your friends? What about friends now? School is over, right? Everyone went their own way. We meet when we wish to. -Yes, Sujith. -Hello. -Did you reach home? -I am about to. Why are you so late? Geethu had to do some shopping. -That's why. -Okay. Anyway, message me when you reach. I am going to sleep. I have morning duty tomorrow. Okay. -Okay. -Okay. Good night. Okay. Good night. Sandeep, just a minute. Let me check if there are any buses. Okay, Teacher. What do you want? One lime juice. Soda or water? Water. -Yes, Teacher. -The last bus hasn't left. -Is that so? Seats are available? -Yes. You may leave then, Sandeep. Okay. So, thank you. Shouldn't I be thanking you, Teacher? KOTTIYAM THENMALA You can sit in front. Dear God… please don't let things happen as I had imagined. I hope whatever I imagined is wrong. I see this as my last chance. God, please don't let it be what I think it is. He is in Kochi. -Did he start working there? -Yeah! No way! We should inform him. Tell me, dude. Martin, we're screwed. What happened? She asked me the same thing thrice. She is pursuing it relentlessly. -No way! -I am sure. Okay. But why are you getting stressed? I can't go behind bars for what you guys did. Where is he? -He is in Kochi. -Did he start working there? -Yeah! -No way! We have to inform him. Have you gone crazy? It's been so many days since that incident. That was Rohypnol, dude. The effect wears off in 24 hours. -It can't be detected in any test. -Yeah, right! Those are drugs given for sedation. How do you know that? My dad is a pharmacist, you fucker! You son of a bitch! My brother is suffering in the hospital. This bitch is doing her investigation in between that! Oh, God! This is just a trivial matter. We have the photos. We have the videos. What the hell can a teacher do? Don't be stressed. Dude, she is coming. -I will call you later. -Okay. Nothing has happened to you, Sister. What all are you saying? Nothing has happened to you. No one has done anything to you. Sister… Brother-in-law Sujith? Hey! -Hi, Sujith. How are you? -Doctor. I am fine. One second. How did you come up with this decision all of a sudden? To abort the child… Abortion? You know she is pregnant, right? I know. Actually, I didn't know. She didn't tell me. She doesn't know that I had seen the report. I thought… she was planning to surprise me after informing her family. I don't understand what you are saying about abortion? Devika had been here a couple of days ago. And she had asked me how long she'd need for an abortion. I thought you've come here to talk about that, Sujith. No, doctor. She hasn't told me anything. Is there any problem between the two of you? What's between us? Sorry. There's no issue between us. Four years of long wait, investigations, medicines… I think you should talk to her. I will talk to her. You must, Sujith. If you abort this child… especially considering Devika's body condition, -another pregnancy would be… -Doctor! Oh, hey! Hi. Sujith, can you please wait? I had an appointment. I will see you around. -Okay? -Okay. Come. Come. Thanks. Come in, Mom and daughter! -Did you take the vaccination? -Yes. Wow! You look smart! Careful. When did you come, dear? Just now. Keep it here. I will go and get the keys. Brother Vishwa is returning these. They won't explode. Dear… look, it's your dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dear… it's been 18 years since he left us. Your Dad who hailed from Thanjavur… My Guna. He was really something. -Okay then, Bro. -Okay. You guys carry on. I expected you for Abu's funeral. You could have come. We do things out of anger. By the time we realize that they were wrong, we would have lost everything! Do you know what's the strongest weapon to destroy someone? Guilt! You should not have that. You should pay a visit to Abu's house. After all, the two of you knew each other so closely, right? I have been noticing you for some time. Do you have anything to tell me? Do you? Dear! Tell me. There's the sky to give us rain There's the forest for the deers to dwell There will be a day for us Come, my dear We have legs to walk There are towns all over this land Let's keep walking forward Without worrying about the future There's nobody who lives on This earth without suffering These losses won't continue Any act of kindness we do Won't it come back to us a hundredfold? The sky will come down You must fly above it The day touches everyone Morning and night The tree gives shade to everyone Be it a coward or an impoverished Even when the interminable Earth is in infinite pain It will show mercy, just like a mother The cool breeze that wouldn't Weep even when there are palings Keeps waving its hands Once you realize that there's a chariot Even within a rock Your sorrow will disappear quickly Like smoke Devika! Devika! De… This year's District Athletic Meet has come to a grand conclusion. Around 200 athletes from 18 schools in this district participated in this athletic meet, over the past three days. Heartfelt congratulations to all the participants who performed amazingly in all competitions. Special congratulations to the champions, Vivekananda High School, and the hosts and runner's up, Kollam St. Jude's High School. We humbly request the participants, students, teachers and staff of all schools, to leave the school and school ground as soon as possible. Thank you. Thank you, students. -Did you check the second floor? -Yes. There is no one there. Oh good. Mr. Jose is downstairs. Okay. -Teacher! -Yes. It's all vacant here. -Okay. -Shall I leave then? Okay. -Aren't you leaving? -I am about to leave. -Okay, then. -Okay. Hey, Teacher is coming! Hey! What is going on? -Aren't you leaving? -We are about to leave. Meet is over. Trophy has been given. Everyone has left. What are you doing here? We thought we will chill here and leave after some time. Enough chilling! Leave now. We can leave only after you. Got it, Teacher. By the way, very well played. Congratulations! I wanted to shake hands with you personally. I was on stage then. Teacher! -Teacher! -Yes. We were sure that we would win the cup. -Oh, wow. I like the confidence. -Thanks. It is homemade. -Thank you. -It's really good. Really? Okay then. Leave now. Teacher, your students from St. Jude's… are awesome! Thank you. Ma'am, we feel really bad about what happened day before yesterday. Sorry. That's alright. We made those catcalls because those girls were dressed in shorts. Is that a major crime? Yes. Isn't that a crime? What's wrong with girls wearing shorts? There is nothing wrong in that. The problem is with the eyes that see it in a wrong way. See, you can get attracted. But the way of expressing it, shouldn't be offensive. Forget it, Teacher. Alright. Get going then. I need to leave. Okay? See you! Make it fast. Didn't you understand? What is your intention? Give it to me. Are you messing with me? I asked you to stop! I said, stop it! That was a sudden effect. I had saved it for Gayathri from 11-B. But the teacher fell for it! Who cares about Gayathri now? What we got is a real treat! Look at her, man! She is even better than Emma Stone! Let's start the show? Hey, what is this? Teacher! Let go of me! You filthy whore! Don't you dare dump someone else's child on me, bloody bitch! I had warned you… not to let her loose. See what happened because of roaming around in the name of sports! She's screwed now, right? It's due to your incapability! What else can it be? Look, this is a serious issue. It's rape. That too, by young boys! Who's going to believe this? Did you believe it when you heard it? No, right? Don't be angry at her. This is her pregnancy period. You can't tell when she would lose her mind. If she does something stupid out of depression, you'd be held responsible. Got it? What do you want me to do now? Get an abortion done before others come to know about it. That's the safest option. Yeah! There's no other option! Dude, please help me. -Me? -I'm unable to bear this, man! Okay. Hey, you got this, right? I got this. Come on. Come. Devika! Devika! Mom, when did you arrive? At noon. Well, I didn't know. What would you do if you knew? Hi, Kevin. Shall I get you some tea? Okay. Make it a strong one with more sugar and less water. Okay. Can't you drink what has already been made, son? Yes, that's fine. I am a man of compromises, Auntie. Come with me, Mom. I have to tell you something. -What for? -Come. I will tell you. Let's go outside. I don't want tea. Is Alice and your daughter doing well? They are fine. How old is your daughter? She will be three years old in May. -Three years? -Yes. Time flies! I can't believe that I have become a father even now! Devika… I came to know about the incident. Sujith told me everything. It was your fault. You should have been more careful. It's not like earlier. We can't imagine what these children are capable of! He has to be blamed! He shouldn't have given you so much freedom. Anyway, an unexpected thing has happened. Now, we should clear the damage. Right? I have a plan. Devika, we will work it out. No one will know. Basically, the family's honor is the utmost priority, right? And as you know, prevention is better than cure. Get up! What I meant was… Get out! -Devika, what I meant… -Get out! His bloody prevention! Mom, please don't go. Let me explain. -Just a minute. -Let go of my hand! What happened? Where is Kevin? Kevin! What is it, dear? Jisha, can you pick me up? I am at Sujith's place. Kevin! -Get lost! -What happened? You rascal! Don't call me for anything hereafter! It's just you and your wife now! Understand? -Tell me what happened. -Go and ask her! Bro, how do you tolerate her? -Hey-- -Hats off to you! Bro, can you give me a lift? -Kevin! -To the town… -I'm going to the next junction. -That's alright. Take me somewhere. -Tell me what happened before you go. -Get lost! Let me know if you are planning to send someone else to advise me. I want to be prepared. You are my husband. Not Kevin. Would be good if you have that in mind. Devika… I told him everything so that he could talk some sense to you. Even you are unable to understand me, Sujith. Hey! I told him when I had an emotional outburst. Emotions. They are not applicable to me, right? Okay. What should I do now? I want to file a complaint. You should accompany me to the police station. Will you come with me? -Come here. -What is it? -What? -Come, I will tell you. -What is the matter? -Just come. Let go of my hand! What is it? We don't need this. Let's go back. I will listen to everything you say. Okay? Let us move to some other place and forget this. Let's just get this aborted. What are you saying? Shouldn't we complain? We'll find some other option. No way, Sujith! I want to file a complaint. You don't know the attitude of the cops here. These scoundrels will make things worse. Finally, they will make it seem as if you did it out of your own interest. This is the land where the court asked the rape victim why she didn't run away while she was being raped! Finally the law will take its course and we'll be stranded on the streets. Please listen to me. Please… Think about Dhanya. If this becomes an issue, will her wedding happen? Tell me. I beg you. Please! Devika! Devika! Devika! Hello. Tell me. Dude, your idea worked. She fell for it. That's great, bro! Come quickly! I need a treat. Okay. You won't get justice from anywhere, dear. I have suffered quite a lot. There is nothing wrong in staying firm in your decision. Everyone has their own definition of what is right. In the end, if you lose everything… no one will be with you! If police batons could breed, this Kalyani would have had many children. Yet, did I admit defeat? As I kept getting attacked, my grit grew stronger. I won't be defeated until I am taken to my grave. You are my daughter! Go ahead with your decision, dear! Devika! Devika! Oh God! Devika! Devika! Devika! Mom! Where is she? -She went her own way. -Where to? I asked her to go home. What for? Mom, do you have any idea what's going on here? Do you know what all she has done? I haven't expressed my grief to her till now. I have heard so many taunts for being unable to have children! I've been insulted so many times! And now… I am fed up, Mom! She told me everything. Mom… You don't know the seriousness of the issue. We won't be able to walk the streets. What will the society think of us? It is better to die than to live fearing the society. Whatever you say, I won't change. I won't file a complaint. You don't have to do anything. She will do whatever is required. There's this thing called grit! You don't have that! Hey. Even your Dad won't forgive you! It happened because she went for that job, right? Some fuckers sedated and raped her! You don't find anything wrong with that? Were you really born to me? Don't ever set foot in the island to see me! Wait, I will drop you. If I know how to come here on my own, I know how to get back too. Mom! Over here. Here as well. Hello. Hello. Where are you? Her phone is with me. Her surgery is going on. Okay. That's good. I will do one thing. I will come there. No. No? Why so? That's how it is! I have told them. Just go there. Okay? -Sujith. -Yes. I heard that you got a free trophy. Who told you? Was it Kevin? Move aside! Stop there! Move away. You bastard! Let go of me! -Get up. -Sujith, listen to me. -Bastard! -Let me explain. What is it? Did she go there to have fun? Did she go there to have fun? I am sorry, Sujith! You were backbiting me all this while, bloody dog! I am sorry, Sujith! Hello! Yes, Ajmal. Studying hard in the morning itself? I have a bank exam next week. Where is your sister? She is over there. Hi, Ajmal. You never came home even though you came here three to four times! Are you still angry with my Dad? My Dad did not tread the wrong path deliberately. His wrong deeds were for the good of others. When a gang from the north came to kill Usman Ikka's son, my dad stepped forward to rescue him. Your Abukka couldn't get away from that life, ever since. My Dad fell into the path of murder and mayhem. Everyone's "Master"! My Dad! He didn't die in an accident. He was murdered! What you feared, came true! I could not bear it. I wanted to settle scores. My mom did not allow me. My dad was a good man. He was really fond of you! He always used to say that he wanted to return this to you. You should accept this. My dad will be happy. Please, Sister. Your Mom was right. You are young. Many people and circumstances will mislead you. You should be careful. Please come home some time. Mom wants to see you. Okay. See you later. Brother-in-law Sujith called multiple times. I disconnected the calls. Many calls are coming from an unknown number now. I didn't attend them. Okay. Yes, Bro. Sister… he is in Kochi. When can you come? Tomorrow. Okay, then. Naveen! Teacher! How come you are here? There is a four-day camp for private school teachers here. It's in Edappally. Oh, that's great! How is Kochi? Did you like it? Oh, I'm finding it difficult to adjust here. It's a total hurry-burry. Kochi is a great place. I think you're not aware about it. Maybe. Looks like you're in love with Kochi. And you look really great now! Teacher… where are you staying? I am staying at my friend's place in Palarivattom. Oh! My hostel is near that area. Really? Give me your number. We can meet when you're free. Give me your number. -I will give you a missed call. -Okay. 9-9-9-5-1 7-6-7-0-2. Oh. Teacher, I have to deliver this order urgently. I will call you later. -Naveen! -Yes. You may go now. I will call you. See you. Bye. Sister, everything is set, right? Yes. Yes, Brother. It is him. I don't go wrong normally. The game is in my ground hereafter. I will take care of him. -Just a minute. -Okay. Sir, I was just… I will leave only with you. Okay, then. I will meet you at home in the evening. Okay, then. Let's go. Hi! -Hi. -Hi. Look, dude! This is awesome! True! It's superb! Move back! Cover me! -Your turn now. -Yeah. Hey, Preethy is at the terrace. She has been waiting for a while. -Oh, God! -She is really furious. Get going! Play! Naveen, we have to talk seriously about our relationship. My dad has come from Dubai. Haven't we decided everything? You will leave as soon as your dad is here. Daddy is telling me to get my degree from there. What's there to decide now? I had a hunch that this will work out. Aren't you interested? What do you think? DEVIKA: HEY! YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THE LOCATION TO MEET TOMORROW. Preethy! It's okay if you are not interested. Shall I go? I wouldn't have come had I known that you were such a guy! Sister! Sister, listen to me. Nothing happened here, right? Is this a problem? This might be simple for you. But it's not like that for me. Sister, you don't know how it is. Once you get involved with a policeman, it is difficult to get out of it. Take your hand off me! Sister, I am not that kind of a man. Women are not part of my list, at all. My parents died in the Peruman train accident. After that, I had no one to guide me. I just took all the paths that appeared in front of me. In those paths, the only good deeds I did… were for Ms. Kalyani. You were sent here by Ms. Kalyani. This house belongs to Ms. Kalyani's friend, Mr. Mathew. I came to Kochi to look after Mr. Mathew. And gradually, I settled over here. Complaining that the naxal revolution wasn't successful, Mathew committed suicide. Sir always used to say that… we are losers! I don't know who won and who lost. All I know is that I am a failure! Like I said, my interests are different. So, you are safe. Nothing will happen to you. I can do anything for Ms. Kalyani. That means… I will do anything for you since Ms. Kalyani has sent you. Period! I… I am quite drunk. So, I will keep on talking. You are safe. Good night. And… about tomorrow! Leave it to me. The person you are calling is busy on another call. Hello? Devika! I have been calling you for several days now. Hey! I want to meet you. What for, Sujith? Well, it's been three weeks since you came home. Shouldn't we talk about it? Hello? Hello? Please don't hang up! Devika! Hey, I am sorry. At that point of time… -You know me, right? -I will call you later, Sujith. -What is it? -It was your wife, right? I have been married for 12 years now. My husband has never apologized to me, even if it is his fault, not even once. It's a relief to know that there are youngsters like you. You'll have a bright future, son. Shall we go? I'll be right back. Sir, didn't I tell you earlier? Today I can't… Sister, there is a slight delay. You carry on. I will come there. But Bro, how can I go there alone? Don't be negative, Sister. He is just a kid. Have some courage. I will come there. I'll be there! You didn't say anything. Should I wait or leave? Let's go. Mom. Mom! Listen, I called her and spoke to her. She has agreed to meet me. Can you call and talk to her? She will listen to you. Will you? Mom, please understand. I can't live without her. I know I did things that no one is supposed to do. Listen to me. Why can't you understand me? 250 rupees. Yes, Geethu. I've been calling you for so long, Devika. I am in Kochi. I don't know what you are planning to do. I will tell you when I am back. Anyway, be careful. Okay. I will call you later. -You've come to meet Naveen, right? -Yes. Come. I will show you the room. -I'll come back next week. -Okay. -Will I get a bus from here? -Of course. Take a rickshaw to the bus stand. Okay. Come. Did you get scared? Consider it like your own place. Come! Beena! -Done? -Yes. There's a booking at 6:00 p.m., okay? Yes. You're happy, right? This is the room. Call me if you need anything. There aren't many amenities here. But… it is safer. I need to freshen up. The washroom is over there. Okay. The person you are calling is busy on another call. Kindly call after… Naveen? What is your bloody problem? We left that subject that day itself. What did you think? That you can bring him here alone and… Oh, God! We know how to teach as well. That's enough. Let us explain the matter to Teacher. Hey Teacher, the visuals are with him. We will delete those now. After that, you will go your way, and we will go our way. Hey, Martin! Look! This is the matter! We could capture only the climax. We didn't have enough time, right? How is it? Isn't it great? And by the way, if we upload this to xvideos, xhamster or pornhub, we will get lakhs of money. No one can trace us if we change the domain. Give it to me. Look, Teacher. It has been deleted. And here's the memory card. Keep this with you. Okay? So, everything is settled, right? Also, you should never cross our paths, ever again! So… what say, Teacher? You're leaving, right? Get lost, you bitch! How can you leave so quickly? After all, you seduced me quite a bit. Naveen, leave it. Martin, tell him. Let that be, man. She has understood. Can you please shut up? Yeah, right! You enjoy, man! Move back, you prick! Dude, come on! -Hey! -On your mark! Naveen! -No, dude. -Get, set! -Come on! -Leave her. -Go! -Martin, he is taking it too far. That's it! Naveen, my dear! What's your problem, you loser? -Let him do what he wants. -Awesome, dude! Get lost, you filthy whore! You! Hey! You bloody… Done? Have you had enough? "Master" for everyone. My dad! When a gang from the north came to kill Usman Ikka's son, my dad stepped forward to rescue him. My Dad fell into the path of murder and mayhem. What you feared, came true! He didn't die in an accident. He was murdered! Brother! Brother, please move! What is it? Mani! Is your class over? Do you have any doubts? Sir. You may leave. Come. Don't be mad. Let me ask you something. You can talk to me if you have any doubts or concerns. Got it? I'm a policeman! Understood? Let go of us! Bro, please don't! Bro, please don't! Run! Get out quickly! Bro, please don't! Bro, please! Naveen! Please let us go! Please! Brother Mani. Bro, no! No! Bro, don't do this. Please don't close the door! No! Sandeep! Martin! Noufal! Bro, please! Please! Bro, please! No, Bro! Bro, my jeans! Please don't remove it. Bro, please! Martin! Martin! Noufal! Bro, no! No! Sandeep, help me! Is it done? Teacher! I won't do it again! I won't do it again. Please ask him to stop! I won't do it again. Sorry! I won't repeat it! No! No, Teacher! When I met you, you were students to me. I didn't know that you never saw me that way. I lost so many things that evening. The moment I decided that I will live my life my way, your fate was sealed. I don't fear anything now. But hereafter, you will be living in fear. You won't forget this lesson until you die! This is your punishment. Your life hereafter, a charity given by me. I'll be watching. This is my word. A teacher's word. Come. I will tell you. The decision is yours now. You have changed a lot, Sujith. You don't realize it. Hey! I'll try and be better. I promise you. But you didn't stand by me when I needed you the most. I understand. It is better to live alone than to live under someone else's shadow. I have learned that now. Can't you give me another chance? Please. Some decisions destroy our fears… and nurture our hopes. Everyone might not agree… but that hope might be the only thing that could help me survive. Sujith! I am living with that hope. I didn't abort the baby. What?
