Stop it Dad! It hurts. Edoardo, this is the most important part of a man's body. - But you're hurting me! - It must always be kept clean. - Roberto, you're hurting him. - Daniela, stay out of this please! Can I help you clean too? No darling, not with that one. - Edoardo! - Edo! Look at this pussy! She's got a pair of tits like a nuclear power station! Gosh! Who is she? Carla, gorgeous foreplay! Come and eat me like a watermelon! Can you help me please? We should call her. - She may give as a good price. - Why don't you just fish? Don't change the topic! If we don't fuck by the end of summer, we are losers. What do you mean? It's not the season of copulation. We're not cormorants! Even Mariotti has fucked. With who? How the fuck do I know? Do you want his tax code too? - I have to go. - Where? Home. Bianca has arrived. - Fuck Bianca! - Fuck you, Arturo! Wasn't she with that rugby player from Milan? He's not a rugby player. She still won't give it to you. - And you're surrounded by pussies. - At least I try. Yes, with whores. So what? Is it better wanking for free or paying for a fuck? - That's a big dilemma Arturo. - Take this! Look! That's Lara and Betta. - Who are they? - The nymphos from 4C. - For you every girl is a nymphomaniac. - This time it's true! Luciani told me. And you trust Luciani? They made a calendar so that each guy in their class can fuck them with no arguments. Yeah, right. - Which one do you want? - Shut up. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. Going to the sea? What do you think? Yes, actually. - You're leaving? - We were fishing. We have a fisherman's house which we use as a hideout. - One of those in the middle of the sea? - Yeah. Do you wanna check it out? Maybe next time. OK, I'll leave you my number. Have we met before? I don't think so, why? I just thought so. What would you do without me, finding you pussies? I wouldn't exactly call them that. - For you, any excuse is good not to fuck. - Fuck off Arturo. Bianca! Bianca! - Bianca! - I'm coming. - Where are your glasses? - I got contact lenses. - You are cute. - Thanks. - New hair cut? - Yes, bangs. - You look like a poodle. - Thank you! - Teagan, I'm coming. - Come on get him out, let me see him. Teagan. Come Teagan! Look who's here, come on! Teagan come here! You're all clean today! - We washed him. - It shows. - Sometimes he gets his turn too. - Hello darling! - How long will you stay? - I'll stay for two or three weeks. That's it? Yes, because I want to go back to Milan first and then if all goes well I can leave for Paris with no rush. Don't classes start in September? Yes but I need time to do a French course and find a flat. - Of course. - Bianca! Can you help me with the bed sheets? I've got a lot of pain. - Coming, Granny! - Thank you. - I'm sorry. See you tonight, OK? - OK! See you later. Bye. Come, Teagan. Come here. Did you empty all the house? I can't leave your Grandfather's clothes to the new tenants. So you're clogging up my wardrobe, Mum! Why don't we invite Bianca for dinner? I made a nice roast beef. She doesn't give a shit about roast beef. Why don't you invite her to Capraia for a few days? To do what? To do what? You'll see at night, in a tent with a campfire. - Here comes the cowboy. - It worked with you. Did you make love in Capraia for the first time? What are you saying? We were with the boy scouts. But Dad lit the fire. - Anyway, if she's still with that guy... - Who cares at their age? Mum, try this. No. wait. This is shit Mum. No its not. We need to find the right shirt. My Mum would like to have her with us in Milan, but she doesn't want to. Any you know, as long as she can manage on her own... The same with my father. You don't know how much I insisted. - And then he ended up like that. - Edo told me you rented the house out. I would have kept the house another year. It's strange to see it empty. - Mum. - I was born there. - Come on Daniela... - I'm so sad. I understand. Oh, by the way, we've gotta get Teagan a fuck. Olivia! Sorry but ever since we've had the builders... Yes, but she's relentless. Your Grandma told me that you'll be going to Paris. Not yet. I'm still waiting for an answer. - But there's a good chance. - Come on, you're good! This year there aren't too many foreign students, so we'll see. - Edo, why don't you try? - What a drag! - It would be good for you to go abroad. - Yes. Have you found a female dog for Teagan yet? No, Olivia is looking for one. - Oh yeah? And how? - I'm putting ads around. But you're looking for the same breed? No, as long as they fuck. Olivia! So I'll let you know if I know about any dogs. - Yes, so you'll get a puppy. - She just told you she's going to Paris! So what? She'll come to visit him here every summer as she does with you. Olivia finish eating! - All good? - Yes it was Matteo, I'll call him later. But if you go to Paris, what will happen with the two of you? Actually, we broke up. Sorry, I wanted to tell you, but I was waiting until it was official. You had a fight? No. It's just that we didn't have anything in common anymore. And it took you three years to realize that? Yes. At the beginning of a relationship other things are more important. Like sex? Well, that too. Sure. - No? - Sure. Come. Elisabetta. Slowly. Slowly. That's good. Edo pass me the bag. Come on! Give me your hand. Thanks. So, do you bring girls here? - No. - Yes. Sometimes. Don't you get bored to stay here all summer? A bit. But we have some gigs. - What kind of gig? - We play in a band. That's cool! When do you play? Thursday at "Leningrad's". Do you want to come? Is that one also yours? That one is mine. This one was his Grandfather's. - Then you've been friends for a long time? - Too long. - Thank you ! - I think it's very cool. - Do you want to come and check it out? - OK. - Betta are you coming too? - Later. Lara, the lighter. - You're not from here, are you? - No, I'm from Civitavecchia. Why did you move here? My mother teaches literature at the University. - And do you like it here? - I can't complain. - Is this your Grandfather? - Yes. Does he come here often? No, he died in September. I'm sorry. Are these his books? No, they're mine. And what do you read? A bit of everything. I've heard about this. It's beautiful. But it's also quite sad. Why? What's it about? A boy trying to cope with the death of people around him. But he's alone. Alone? What about his parents? They are not there. And where are they? Doesn't say. Can you lend it to me? But what if you like it? I'd buy another one. It wouldn't be the one you read. I will survive. Or you can give it to me if I like it a lot. Can't you? No, wait. What's up. No, it's that... Don't you trust me? No, but we just met. Well, sorry then. Don't worry. Shall we go? - Bye! - Bye. - Did you pump her? - No. You? Yes. You never went and saw anyone about this? When I was a kid. And? The paediatrician said it's get better if I exercise it. Do you masturbate? I tried, but it was too painful. Anyway, you are right, Phimosis it is. I've finished, you can get dressed. Why did you come here by yourself? Do your parents know about this? No. They think everything is alright. But I have to talk to them before we can go ahead with surgery. Surgery? Otherwise how can I help you? In your case, your foreskin it too narrow and it doesn't allow the glans to come out properly. We nee to cut the top of the foreskin, here. Then we put some stitches all around it. Once it's healed, the glands will be uncovered. Problem solved. Will it always be uncovered? Yes, but being exposed to the air, it'll become thicker and less sensitive. I don't want to have an operation. - What are you scared of? - Everything. It's painful. I've read on the Internet about people becoming deformed for life. I wouldn't go on the Internet too much. I don't want to have surgery. I understand. I'll give you a cortisone cream. Use it morning and night for three weeks. See if it helps to reduce the thickening of the foreskin. And if it works. then I don't need an operation? We'll see. I'll also write down a few lubricants that you can use without having to force your foreskin. - What do you mean? - You must try to masturbate. It is important that you start feeling more comfortable down there. Here. Goodbye. - I haven't cooked anything else! - Daniela, the fish was so good! It's from one of Roberto's clients from Livorno. I'd rather be paid than get a free sea bass. You should give me the recipe. Mum, can I have my hair red just like Anna? - We'll see, Olivia. - What a bore, it's always "we'll see". - Olivia speak properly! - I didn't say anything! I've heard you're looking for a female dog - Do you know any? - There's our Minnie. She's so tiny. Will Teagan's thingy fit in it? - Stop it! - What? I said stop it! Edo, did you decide which University to go to? - I can't make my mind up. - He'd like to study literature, but we think he should study engineering abroad. It's you who insists on that. I think he should do whatever he wants. - You just want to keep him in Pisa. - So what? The umbilical chord must be cut! Look at Bianca, she's a girl and she's going by herself to Paris. Then maybe I'm a girl too. What a drag! Edo answer properly! - Why don't you just leave him alone? - Olivia, stay out of this please! Stop it! Marco, can I have some wine? I'm sorry that I couldn't come for the funeral No problem. At least you remember him alive. I think I'm getting scared about leaving for Paris. - But you were convinced until yesterday. - I am convinced. It's more like vertigo. Like you want to jump into the sea from a rock, but you're scared. Like that. - To me it's like that with trains. - Vertigo? Yes. I'd love to put my head out the window but I'm always afraid of a tunnel or a pole. And then you don't do it? No. But I want to. - Who is it? - Edo, open the door! - What do you want? - I have to talk to you. - Tell me from there. - A lady has just called about dogs. So what? She's find with letting her dog fuck Teagan. Tomorrow we're all going to Siena. Do you think I want to come on a trip just to see two dogs fucking? Dad said it's be fun. We'll also go visit Aunt Mary's. Lucky us! Let me in. I have something to show you! Fuck Olivia! How is it? Are you stupid? - No, why? - Has Mum seen you? - Am I pretty? - Not pretty, just stupid! - Asshole! - Leave me alone. I've got things to do. Egoist! You're coming to the concert or not? I already arranged a date with Bianca. Bring her too. And what if they meet? That's be great. Women love competition. Sure, I'll make a fool of myself. Yes. Do you know anyone who is circumcised? No. why? In the book I'm reading a guy get's circumcised. - Lucky him! - Why? Because the glands are less sensitive and you last much longer. Why do you think all the porn actors are circumcised? Why don't you get it too then? Because it's very painful. They insert a syringe inside your glands, and put stitches all around it. Come on, shut up! Anyway, it we don't fuck, - it's a mess. - What a drag, Arturo! - Let's get a couple of octopuses. - What for? To fuck them. - What are you talking about?! - It's the closest thing to a pussy. Why do you think it's called "octopussy" in English? - It's called "octopus". - Same sound! Shut up! I'm thirsty, let's get something to drink. - I've got no money. - I'll pay as usual. And she kept calling 'Bianca, Bianca' but I couldn't hear. - Hi. - Thanks for coming. It was a pleasure. - Hi! - Hi. Sorry. Elisabetta, met Bianca. - Bianca, this is Elisabetta. - Nice to meet you. - I brought you the book back. - You've finished it already? Yes, so beautiful. Maybe we can talk about it later. - Sure. - Guys, we're going to the sea. Coming? I don't know. - I don't really feel like it. - You Betta? - Yes, I will. You're not coming? - No, maybe next time. Thanks. Bye. - Did you want to go? - No, don't worry. - Are you sure? - Yes, sure. Have you ever been to Capraia? No, but they told me it's so beautiful. Why don't we go there? You and me? Yes. OK. When are we going? In a couple of weeks? But I'm leaving in two weeks. Then tell me when. I'm going to visit Chiara in Cinque Terre for the weekend. - Shall we go when I come back? - OK? Where are we going to sleep? - We could bring a tent. - Cool. Do you have one? - Yes. I do. - Cool! Can I also read that book you gave Elisabetta? Of course. - Are you sure? - Sure - Daniela come here. - No. Tell me the truth. Maybe somebody said something during dinner. She already knew it by then! - Maybe Olivia told her. - Roberto, don't drag Olivia into this. I don't know who told her! You told her! Tell me when that happened. - Daniela stop it. - You stop it! - Why don't you look me in the eyes? - What's this got to do with it? You have been acting strangely since January. You've been busting my balls since January! - You don't say! - Yeah. - Tell me the truth. - I did! Dad. there are also these. Look at the stuff that your Mum brings for three days! I know. Listen, do we have a tent? - It should be in the garage. Why? - Maybe I'll go to Capraia with Bianca. - And you tell me just like that? - How else? - When are you going? - Next week. That's great, isn't it? What did I tell you! There's also this. - Are you kidding me? - It's all for your sister! - Teagan behave yourself. - I'll call you as soon as he fucks. - Bye, dear. - Bye, Mum. Call me when you come back at night. Turn off the gas. - Behave, ah? - Sure. Buy yourself one of those easier to build tents, mine is too complicated. - You'll make as ass of yourself. - Thank you. Behave yourself! Come on, we've got the house to ourselves and 150 Euros. That money is to buy a tent, not to fuck around with. I told you I'll give you mine. Listen to this: "Pamela, come and suck the apple of sin". You say "bite". There must be a reason she says "suck". Yes, it's because she doesn't know Italian. Do we have to give report cards to whores now? Why do you keep breaking my balls? Because you're not going to Capraia like that. - Like what? - Like a virgin! She used to bang a rugby player. First, he's not a rugby player and secondly they broke up. - She'll still be comparing you to him. - And how can a whore help? How? For everything. Feeling pain, premature ejaculation, mental blocks. Pain? Pain! Doing it with a hooker's like throwing a sausage down the hallway. What about a hand job? Are you insane? I'll wank you myself for 150 Euros. Hello, hi! Are the photos genuine? And for a fuck? - Well? - She hung up the phone. Of course she did, you're a beast. You call her. - That's not what I mean. - You call her! - It's your idea. - Don't play against me, call her. - I won't call her. - Come on, help me out here and call her. That sucks! Always me! - Give me the number. - Here you go. - I'm going to cancel. I can't! - Are you crazy? - What if Bianca's grandma sees us? - We'll say she's the cleaning lady. - With her tits hanging out? - She won't come dressed up as a whore. - Have some pumpkin seeds. - I don't feel like it. - You'll cum much more. - Who gives a shit! They do! It's like telling them that you love them. - Who are you calling? - Her! - Are you crazy? - Get off me, please! I'll give you a hundred Euros and you can go. I won't to lose my virginity to a stranger! - You told me you did it with Lara. - I was bullshitting you. She's here. Go! You speak to her. Fuck! She's a monster! I told you the pictures were not genuine. - How could I know that? - Now what? - We wait for her to leave. - She'll call her pimp on us. Come on look at her! No pimp would take her. - Still we have to talk to her. - OK, but you talk! I'm sorry madam, the intercom wasn't working. I've been waiting here for ages. I know, you're right. But unfortunately... Madam, we're sorry, but we thought about it. It's just too expensive for us. I didn't ask for any money. Who are you? I'm here for the dog... I had arranged a meeting with Olivia. - She's here for the dog. - How should I know? Where's Olivia? - Olivia has gone away with my parents. - She didn't tell me. She forgot to. - When is she back? - In two or three days. Now what? I don't know. I'm sorry. - OK then, tell her to call me back. - For sure. Next time she'll have to come to my house! - Sure, we'll tell her. - Bye. You got lucky there. Imagine having to fuck her! Fuck off Arturo! She's not going to come. Let's wait five minutes and then we'll call her again. Why didn't you do it with Lara? Because she was still thinking about her ex. Who is he? How should I know? - What? - She's here! Are you sure? Of course, she came by taxi. My god! What a pussy! What do we do now? Now... no fear! I said one hundred and fifty per person. - We don't have three hundred Euros. - What do you want me to do about it? - What about a student discount? - I'm not a museum. There must be something else we can do for 75 per person? No. Sorry, whose money is it? Mine. - Then he comes with me. - What about me? - How should I know! Just watch TV. - Watch TV? Shall we? - What if I put in thirty Euros? - I told you no! Don't you have a little something for me? Yes. Sorry. Thank you. That's our bed? It's a bit small. Come on. You're a little shy. It's my first time. Really? Then let's do something beautiful. OK? You're a bit tense, are you? Don't you like me? Come on! No. wait. I have a problem. What problem? Here? Let me see. Let's take a look. I see. You've seen it before? Some people have it. And they can still do it? Carefully, but yes. Like how? You need to put a condom on. It'll be less painful. Really? Yes. I'll show you how. It's important to wear it. Also, you have to get in slowly. Very slowly. I'm gonna show you how. I could actually go with any girl? Yes, I told you. You'd have to be careful. - So, shall I show you? - Wait... No, I think I'm fine. What do you mean? You don't want to fuck anymore? No. Listen, I can't give you your money back It's fine. OK. Are you OK? Bye then. So? So what? - Did you fuck her? - No, I got sad. What do you mean? And the money? - She kept it. - I could have fucked her instead! - With my money? - Christ you're stingy sometimes. Stingy my ass! I always pay. If I don't fuck by the end of the summer, I'll kill myself. - This one? - Yes, let's go. I'll teach you how to put it up. I'm so lucky to have you. However... did you listen to me? What can I say? Why don't you try with Lara again? - I think she's pissed off with me. - Why? What did you do? When we were at the fisherman's house, I put it out and she didn't like it. What did you put out? What do you think? She tells you she is still suffering for another guy and you put it out? I wanted to make her mouth water. Did you apologize later? She doesn't answer the phone anymore. - Thank God they were nymphomaniacs... - Listen! Forget the instructions. So? So what? Write her a letter. Are you mad? That's so gay! Then keep on showing her your cock, which is very intelligent. What should I write in the letter anyway? I don't know. Tell her you really like her and that you fucked up because you were ashamed to show your real feelings. - Would an email work as well? - Yeah sure, a "whatsapp" message. Why? - Drop it. - Tell me! I told you to drop it. Look at his head! - Big, eh? - Touch here. - How disgusting! - We're going to fuck the shit out of it. - Why "we"? - Because we caught it together. - It was me who caught it. - I told you where it was. But I took the shot. - Yeah, but I told you... - Don't break my balls. But... Next time I'll shoot you, so you'll shut up! Hi Mum. Mum! What's happening? Edo, leave me alone! - Olivia, what's happened? - They had a fight. Where's Dad? He took the train. Why? Mum found out Dad has been cheating on her with Anna. - Why would she think that? - She found a condom in the car. - Are you kidding? - Does it look like I'm kidding? Mum! - What are you doing? - Edo, leave me alone! But what are you doing? I'm burning that bitch's things. - Mum, please! - Edo! What's up? Did you cook my octopus? - Oh, it was yours? - Yes. I'm sorry, I thought Mr Paoli had brought it. I was going to grill it. - You can't grill octopuses! - Mind your own business. Please don't fight. I'll get another one. Can you pass me the bread? A lady came with a dog for Teagan. Oh Mum, we totally forgot! - Was the dog nice? - No, too small. Olivia, don't answer! But maybe it's for Teagan. Eat your lunch. You too. - Mum, let me answer. - I said no! Do you think they're going to divorce? I don't know. I don't want to spend the weekends at Anna's. You won't. Carli has to. You won't. Are you all right? I'm alright. I'll tell you everything. Bye. And your Mum? She was crying. Kids? Mythical Babylonian king, twelve letters. Try Assurbanipal. - Where's your father right now? - I have no idea. - You're right! - Haven't you talked to him? No. We can go to Capraia another time. - Just give me a couple of days. - You sure? Capitol of Arizona? Phoenix with PH, madam. Do you think we'll end up so superficial when we're older? I don't think they're superficial, maybe there are reasons we don't know about? I think the more you're exposed to feelings, the less you feel. Senna's initials? - "A.S." - Oh Grandma, enough now! - But I don't know the answers. - I understand, but we're talking here. Take it easy. I found this. From Elisabetta. Thank you. - Have you finished the book? - No, not yet. But it's beautiful. Hi Edo! Thank you. The ones you asked me for were being washed. It's OK. - I didn't know if you had lunch. - Thank you. - You don't want to be with us anymore? - This has nothing to do with you. Actually it does. I fucked up. Big time. Mum? At home. What is she doing? She cries. Olivia? Nothing. Did you buy the tent? - I don't know if I'm going anymore. - Why? What do you think? Act cool, Lara and Elisabetta are there. So? So, I don't want any discussion. Stop it. Hi. Hi. Hi. - How's it going? - Fine, you? Fine. - How are you? - Good. Did you already swim? Yes, but the water was cold, so we came back. - Do you want to take a dip? - Later. Thanks for the letter. No problem. I wanted to answer, but I had some issues at home. Don't worry, I was a bit out of my head when I wrote it. No. it was beautiful. It made me think. - Sorry, I have to make a phone call. - Sure. - Edo, come here! - No, I don't want to, Arturo. - Morning! - Hi. What can I get you? How much is that one? Fifty Euros per kilo. Caught today. And that one? Twenty five Euros per kilo. Should I weigh it? No need. Just give me this octopus. - How many is it for? - Just me. Isn't it too big? - No. - OK. Bianca. Bianca! - Shall we go? - I don't know if I feel like. Why? What's happened? I didn't get into the Sorbonne. Why not? There were eighty places. I finished one hundred and second. I'm sorry. Me too. I think I might try Milan. - That's so sad. - How come? You shouldn't give up like that. I'm not giving up. I tried and it didn't work out. If not, I could try here in Pisa. You'd get bored after three months. Wouldn't you be happy to have me in the same city? Of course, but... What? To me you've always been the one who ran away. Maybe for once I won't run away. But by now I'm used to chasing after you. Sorry, Wait a second. OK. Is everything alright? It's nothing. What's happening? - Nothing. - Tell me, does it hurt? No. - Do you want to stop? - No, don't worry. Are you sure? OK. Take it easy. Come on, it hurts you, let's stop. - Bye. - Bye. I'm sorry, Bianca. It doesn't matter, Edo. - Bye. - Bye. Dad? - What the fuck are you doing? - What do you think? Are you crazy? Go to a hairdresser! - I do what I want! Come on, Edo! - Stop it! - Leave me alone! - Where's Mum? She's at aunties house. Come. Come on. Come on. Are you ready? Go! - Who is it? - Dad. It's Edo. Hi Edo. - Can I come in? - Sure. - Mum? - Hi dear. - What's going on? - Nothing. We're just talking. Mum brought me some shirts. I was on my way home. See you later. I have something to tell you. - What? - Has something happened to Olivia? No. So what's happened? - What is it? - I need to have an operation. What? Where? My penis. Because of the skin problem? But wasn't it OK? Why didn't you tell us before? - Because I was scared. - Scared of what? Roberto, easy. OK, well, we'll give it some thought. I want to do it right away. - Listen, you've already seen a doctor? - Yes, I've discussed it with him. Are you scared? Relax, we did it to a kid yesterday and he's back on his feet already. - How old was he? - Five. Wait a minute here. I'll come back to get you. You'll feel something cold, Edoardo. How do you fell Edoardo, are you OK? Not really. Now we'll get rid of this issue. Now you'll feel a piercing. Just don't worry about it, OK? Come on, it'll pass immediately. It's already done. Wait a moment. Do you feel anything? Now I don't. - What are you doing Olivia? It's mine. - Relax! It's not champagne. - Behave! - What a drag! Guys, even in the hospital? Sweetheart, look who's here! So you keep secrets from me? How are you? Very bad. They had to cut more skin than expected, so they'll keep him overnight too. - Have you seen it? - Are you out of your mind? I took a peek earlier and... - Excuse me. - Please. Look at you, you look like Jesus with the apostles. Why, was Jesus circumcised too? I don't know. Try asking the priest. - How are you? - Bad. Could I have another painkiller? It hasn't been that long. You'll need to wait a bit longer. Can you hold on? Dad? Yes. Are you coming back home or what? I don't know Edo. We'll see. What about the other day with Mum? The other day wasn't a good idea. Why? Because rushing things sometimes makes them worse. Then why don't you both take it slower? We'll try. Good night. Good night. Bye Dad. Edo! Hi. - How are you? - So so. Olivia told me about the operation. - Is that why you were avoiding me? - I wasn't avoiding you. - Well, I sent you ten thousand messages. - I would have answered. Listen, I'm leaving. - To where? - Paris. - Going to study something else? - No, I'll find a job until I settle in. Are you leaving right away. Next week. Now I'm going back to Milan for a few days. Can't you wait a little while? I think that the longer I put it off the harder it will be. Bianca, let's go. I don't want to drive when it's dark. Yes. - Can you wait for me a moment? - Sure. I finished it. - Thank you. - Thank you. Will you come and see me? Promise! I promise. Hi, how are you? So so. - You came with Dad? - Yes. - Where's Mum? - At the office. - What are you making? - A cake. For what? For me. It's my birthday. I'm so sorry, Olivia! I forgot. Happy birthday. It's OK, you are excused. They were cutting your penis. Thank you. - What kind of cake? - Chocolate. - Listen, what are you doing today? - Nothing. Why? Is it a surprise? - Why are they not fucking? - They are studying each other. - They don't seem to give a damn. - They're getting to know each other. - They've been at it for half an hour! - That's the best part of it. - You mean the best part is not fucking? - Are you asking me? It seems all right. The stitches are gone. Keep on putting the cream that I gave you. The movement is good. Perfect, you can get dressed. Come on now, I made you a racing dick. What should I do now? Now you have to use it. But don't I have to wait? I think you've waited long enough. But isn't there any risk of complications? Yes, here, if you don't get a move on. Let me know. - Thank you. - Behave. - I don't understand, you did it or not? - Yes, but it was a disaster. - Why? - She cried the whole time. - Because it was painful? - She was thinking about her ex. Still? That sucks! - So what did you do? - What could I do? I stopped. - She'll get over it sooner or later. - Let's hope so. That kind of thing never happens in porn films, does it? They should do porn films with girls crying over their exes. Like porn soap operas. Pornoperas. Pornoperas. And what about Bianca? She's gone. - Go and visit her. - Too late. Why? - She thinks I'm a loser. - That's exactly why she likes you. Because I'm a loser? No, because you're sensitive. Girls love that, they're not animals like us. If you say so. Are you sure you didn't fall in love with Lara? Shut up! Hi. What are you doing here? I brought you this. - But I've read it already. - I know, but I wanted you to have it. - Thank you. - It's a pleasure. Lara told me you're going to Paris. I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm going to see Bianca. Cool! But I wanted to say goodbye in person. I am glad. Want to come in? - This is you when you were little? - Yes. Cute. And that one? My brother. What? Nothing. We still don't know each other? No, not that. It's my first time. And so? I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. Because you're in love with someone else? And you worry about me? You're sweet. - So you're going by train? - Yes. How long will it take? - Eleven hours. - My God! - But I'll be asleep for most of it. - I doubt it. You'll be too excited for that. Who is in there? Edo! Dad? - What are you doing? - I slept in the tent. - I can see that, but it's raining. - It wasn't last night. Buy why didn't you sleep on the couch? It went this way. - Edo, where have you been? - I slept at a friend's house. And you couldn't call? I haven't slept all night! Sorry Mum. You both come inside. It's raining. - Who put up the tent? - I did it. - Good work. - Thank you. - Come on, let's go. - I'm coming. - Bye Edo. - Bye Olivia. - Behave. - You too. - Did you take a jacket? - Mum, it's August. - Well, it's still a northern city. - Don't worry. - Call me whenever you need to. - You too. - Edo, your headphones. - Thank you. - I'll call you when I arrive. - Behave. Bye. Say hello to Bianca. - Can I sit in the front? - Yes, of course. Subtitles synced by Pablo O'Connor
