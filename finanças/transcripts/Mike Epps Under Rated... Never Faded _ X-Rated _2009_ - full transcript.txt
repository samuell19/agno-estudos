Motherfucking frisbee -- threw the motherfucker. "I don't know them bitches. They live in san diego." Women love to catch a nigga jacking off. That's why you got to have the remote control right here on your lap -- so you can hit "stop" and put your dick under your shirt. "Who is that?" Son! That's how women walk in the door on your ass -- just like this. "What are you doing?" I'm gonna do it again. This is how they come around the corner like this. "Caught your ass, didn't i?
