This is, like, me and Jess' family version. - Oh. - It's a lot... It's more fun, I think. - Okay. -Okay. Here's where it gets hard. What's the saddest thing that's ever happened to you? -The saddest thing that's ever happened to me? -Yeah. -You know what? I'd probably rather not talk about it. -No?

Actually, the only person that's ever beat is bradman. -Who's bradman? - Is that your first question? - Sure. -Bradman is Jess' boyfriend. He is awesome. And he's probably gonna get drafted by the Dodgers. Is bradman, like, your role model or something? -Question number two, cutting deep. You learn fast. I would say, yeah, bradman is definitely a good role model, for sure. -Do I just ask another question? -You keep it coming till I give up, yeah. -Okay. Um... Pete. What's your last name? -You don't know my last name? -Why would I know your last name? It's not like we hang out outside of our apartment or anything. -It's on my mailbox. -Oh, what am I?

No. Do I have a crush on you? No. - I don't know. I mean, first you ask me to marry you, and then you know my last name. - That doesn't mean... I know lots of people's last names, and I don't have crushes on them. I don't have a crush on you. -That's... that's fine. I was just wondering. -Why? -'Cause I kind of have a crush on you. -Oh! -[ Gasps ] [ Thud ] -Do you think it's, like, a... a turtle? -I don't know. [ Sighs ] Jesus. It looks like it's part snake.

Uh, I was carrying this box of, uh, plates across the street, and I-I guess I wasn't really looking where I was going, and... But, uh, the... the person that hit me was in a convertible, so all the plates... You know. Oh, she had insurance, so she's fine now, too. -Okay. Cool. -She was really pretty. Hey, I know you were joking before, but, um, you know, I was just wondering... Would you... would you marry me? -I... [ chuckles ] I mean, I was just... playing. -Yeah, [chuckles] I know. I just don't feel like anybody would ever want to marry me. Like, I'd marry you, you know? [ Chuckles ] - Really? - Yeah. You're a catch. - Okay. So, like... so... So, if right now I was like, "let's get married," you'd... you'd say yes? - Yeah. - [ Chuckles ] -Let's get married. -You're kidding. -No, i'm... I'm not, but y-you are. -No, I'm not. I'm not. -Me neither. -What, so is this... For real? -I don't know. Think about it. -I'm thinking about it.

Get couple's stationary. - Yes. - Yeah? - Uh, and robes. - Monogrammed, matching. - Hey, we should sign a prenup. - Totally. My parents always said, "do whatever you want, but make sure you get a prenup." - [ Chuckles ] Wait. Really? -Yeah. "Pete keeps his... All of his lots of money. Sophie keeps her kitchenaid." Seems fair to me. I should take you on a date. We're getting married, and we haven't been on a date yet, so... Uh, Pete. What do you think this was? [ Ice rattles ] -How'd it go? -I had a lovely time. -Very good. Oh, wait! - What? -I know exactly what we need. [ Soothing music plays ] Hi. - Hi. Can I take this off? - Yep. -Okay.

Oh, your sister's super tidy. -[ Groans ] [ Blowing ] -Oh. Okay. [ Sighs ] -Her phone's off. Her phone's off, which is typical Jess. You know, that's, like, so standard. That's exactly what she does. -She... her phone probably just died, and she just lost her key and couldn't get into the room. - Mm... mnh-mnh. She would've knocked. She would've knocked. -Hey, hey. Pete, I'm sure nothing happened. -She probably just went home with someone. -No. What? No! She... that's not... She wouldn't... she doesn't... What if she was murdered? - No. [ Chuckles ] -We should turn on the news. [ Emergency broadcast signal blaring ] -This is a test of the broadcast stations... -Our song. [ Chuckles ] -[ Chuckles lightly ] I don't understand. You said by morning. -[ Chuckles ] Well, we ran into a couple of problems. -Dude, you said "no problem" like five times! -Totally my bad. Uh... Tomorrow morning definitely, and I think, uh, I'm pretty confident I have this one figured out, so, yeah. Oh, by the way, I, uh... I borrowed that. Uh, really good movie. -Are you sure she did not come by? -Yes. -[ Sighs ] [ Muffled scream ] Hey. Hey, it's gonna be okay. We're gonna find her. - [ Sighs ] -Okay? Hey. - No. - Okay?

I hate this bar. -Hey, Timmy! -Oh, great. -How's your mom? -He used to be to be my stepdad. I'm just gonna hang out back here by the car. -Okay. Bye, Timmy. - Hi. We were here last night. - Inside of the bar. -And we lost our friend that we were with. -My sister, actually. She never came home. -Maybe you've seen her? -She looks like me, but she's shorter and a girl, so I guess, in that sense, she looks kind of like her. -So like a cross between him and me. - But more blonde. - Right. -She... she highlights. -I see a lot of blondes... Natural blondes, too. -Okay, give me your phone. [ Sighs ] Her. -Oh, okay. I remember her. -[ Claps ] Yes! -Yeah, she went home with someone. - You're a fucking liar, man! - Okay, Pete, slow down. Slow down. It's okay, really. - I'm sorry. I know. - Okay, she'll probably call. We'll just hang around and wait. It's not a big deal. -No, I think maybe you're thinking of someone else. So, if you could just look at... Just look. Uh, she's not that type of girl. -Okay, you know what? Let's go back to that frosty shop that we saw on the way in. -No. It was definitely her. She left, like, in a big Van with... with a man. 6'2", beard down to here. - Ungh! - Pete! Pete! How is she supposed to call if you break your phone? [ Sighs ] -Is there anything else that we should know? -He wore a necklace.... Made of animal bones. -Okay, yeah, we need to find your sister. -[ Sighs ] -Hey, Timmy! Tell your mom I'll call her! -She doesn't want to talk to you, man! God! -Ow! -Did I break it? [ Slow western music plays] -[ Sighs ] Hey. -Hey. -[ Exhales deeply ] How's the tea? - Not very good. - [ Chuckles ] Well, that's why I'm drinking the coffee. [ Slurps ] -So, you live out here? -Uh, I live where I want. I'm a wanderer. -Must be nice. -It is what it is. We're all wanderers in our own way. You're going to L.A.? -[ Chuckles ] Yeah. Could you tell? -Uh, no, you just said it like 300 times last night. -[ Chuckles ] Sorry. Sometimes I just... I feel like people can tell a lot about me just by looking at me, you know? -I've been looking at you this whole time, and I don't know anything about you. You, um... You still need a ride? -You going to California? -I'm a wanderer. -Right. -Do you feel like, um... Do you feel like something... Something brought US together? Something... You know, something bigger than US? -Yeah. Tanqueray. -We all got different names for it. [ Mellow acoustic guitar plays ] -So, beard and a necklace. Yeah, I know where that guy lives. [ Slow western music plays ] -[ Sighs ] - Ow! - Whoo! -Whoa! -6'2" with a beard down to here and a necklace made of... Animal bones. -Oh. I think you guys are looking for Chuck. -Yeah. -Okay, uh, I mean, I don't know. Maybe. -We're... We're looking for his sister. -Yeah, she's blonde, kind of hot. -Oh, yeah. -You saw her? -Uh, yeah, we, uh... We heard her. Loud. -Do you know where they went? -Where? No. We don't really know where. Maybe the highway? Where do you think they went? -Yeah. Could've been... Could've been the highway. -Yeah, I think the highway's a pretty good place to start. -Or maybe the frosty shop, actually. -No. Remember? The frosty shop's still closed. -Oh, that's right. Prostitution thing. -Maybe... home depot. Or maybe just the highway. -Okay, so, you think they went maybe that direction? - [ Hesitantly ] Yeah. - Okay, great. -Great. -Really appreciate it, guys. Thank you so much. [ Water splashes ] -You're welcome. Kind of nice. -Yeah. I like them.

She went home with somebody from a bar. It's not that big of a deal. That's what people do. -That's what you do. -[ Inhales sharply ] Then I should know. And you know what? I know why she hasn't called. She hasn't called because she is with some weird, tall guy, and they are busy, probably, fucking. He's fucking her. You know what? There might be more than one guy. There might be multiple guys and there are all sorts of dicks up in her mouth, just fucking her mouth, and then there are dicks just all up in her ass, just fucking... Just fucking her ass. -She's your family, too, Sophie. No, Pete, she's not. -Well, not technically yet. -Pete, it's a joke. -There's nothing funny about your sister-in-law in some group, gang-bang sex party. It's not funny. -No, you and I are a joke. US. We're not fiancés. We were never gonna be some happy married couple, okay? It's just a stupid idea. We're neighbors. I use your Wi-Fi. -You can pull over wherever, man. We're good. [ Mellow guitar music plays ] -[ Sighs ] [ Door closes ] -What were you thinking? -How could you do this to your brother? -How could you do this to Sophie? -You know, we've been driving around all day. -You could've... You could've called. You could've picked up the phone. You could've called. -Pete thought you were dead! -I could only assume at some point! What else... - And who the fuck is this guy?! - Seriously. He... he looks like uncle Craig. You know what? I'm gonna go talk to him. - Yeah, I think you should. - I think I will. - [ Scoffs ] -I'm gonna go see what this... Jerk is all about. -Look, Jess. I get it, okay? I mean, I personally have hitchhiked across several states, but you know what? Did you even stop for one second to think about how irresponsible this was? -No. What... [ scoffs ] What, am I gonna through every decision like, "hmm, I wonder what this means for my brother and his fake girlfriend"? -Yes. Yes, that is exactly what you should be doing. You should be thinking about other people. You know, you're not the only person in this world that counts. -You told me to have fun. -I didn't tell you to go run off and disappear with some man that has animal bones around his neck. -They're puka shells! Jesus Christ! -That is... -I make some necklaces and some, uh, turquoise jewelry. -I don't even know why I was freaking out earlier, 'cause you are... You're cool, man. You're great. -You're cool. -Oh, what, and you two are such mature adults? -Yes... yes! And compared to you, yes! -You know what? Perfect. This is great. I have a great idea for you. -[ Scoffs ] Why are you wearing turquoise bracelets? -Shh! No, this is gonna be great. -[ Murmurs ] - Pete, Sophie... - What? - I have a surprise for you. Chuck, here, happens to be an ordained minister. -Congrats, man. Very cool. -I officiated at my friend bleslie's ceremony at lake havasu. -So, what do you say guys? You wanted to get married. -Oh [chuckles] uh... -Oh. Yeah I don't... -It would be an honor. -We would love to, but I actually have to be getting back to L.A. -Yeah, I think it's just bad timing to do it right now. -And then, aside from the timing, I mean, there's, you know, also the things. - It's mostly bad timing. - Really, Pete? What's going on here? -You want to know what's going on here? Here's what I see. I see two kids who are scared. They're in love, but they're scared. Of what? Of each other. Of their love for each other... Your beautiful love for each other. [ Slow western music plays ] Now, listen, you two. This is a tough world, but you've found something here. You can choose to ignore it and go home, or you can choose to be happy together in this life, maybe even the next. -So, you gonna chase it like a leopard? [ Footsteps approach ] -Hey, guys. What's happening? Hey. -We're getting married. - [ Chuckling ] Right now? - Right now. - Right fucking now. - No. Tomorrow. Tomorrow morning. Tonight is the wedding feast. -What about the hot dogs? -I don't need those dick-bags. -[ Chuckles lightly ] Cool. Cool! [ Chuckles ] [ Tribal drums and pipe playing ] -Hey, man, uh, got you a wedding present. I fixed your car. - Thanks, man. - Definitely, definitely. You can just, uh, get me a check or whatever tomorrow. -[ Screeches ] -Yeah, uh, my mom's bringing it by later. You know how mom's are. - For sure. - Yeah. Hot dog? - I'm okay. - Cool. -[ Sighs ] So, there's this one. I wore it to the spring semi-formal. And there's that one. - Whoop. - Um... - Just look at that one. -Yeah, I guess any dress is fine, then, as long as I don't look like an idiot. [ Chuckles ] -Sophie, this is... This is Marc by Marc Jacobs. So... - No, the dress is nice. [ Sighs ] Yeah, I... maybe I should try and be hot for once. -You're gonna look great. I'm serious. [ Tribal music continues ] Sorry for making you guys drive around all day. I probably should've just called. -It's fine. I wasn't really worried about you. I mean, I was worried about you, but I was 19 once, too. -I'm 21. I had fun, though. But then it got kind of weird. -Yeah, that's the thing. [ Sighs ] It always gets weird. -It's so funny. Pete's in love. -[ Chuckles ] -Yeah. I guess he is. - Mm-hmm. [ Breathes deeply ] -Well, the dresses... -Yeah. Hmm. [ Tribal music continues ] -And bestow upon him the blessing of fruitful loins. -[ Coughs ] [ Horn blows ] -Oh, this one's pretty great. Right? Sophie. Sophie, this is it. This is... this is totally your wedding dress. I mean, okay, I... Know it's kind of short, but try it on. I think that you're really gonna like it. -[ Stammers, chuckles ] Thanks. - Sure. [ Door opens, closes ] [ All howling ] Hi, guys. - Jess. Hey, come here. - Okay. - Here, put on this head lamp. - All right. [ Chuckles ] -It's cool, right? [ Pipe playing ] So, your guy is... cool. -Yeah. -He taught me a lot about eagles. -[ Chuckles ] Really? -Which was pretty cool. -You know we're not a... A thing, right? -I mean, I don't know. I know you're still... Upset about Brad. -I'm not upset about Brad anymore. I mean, I... I am, but not really, you know? -Yeah. [ Both chuckle ] -[ Chuckles ] I honestly never thought you'd get married. -Really? -Yeah. I mean, I never really gave it too much thought, but... I guess I never pictured it happening. -I don't know. I guess I never pictured it happening like this. -It makes sense, though. I mean, and Sophie... I like her. -[ Chuckles ] [ Music continues ] Hey, I wanted to ask if you would, uh... Be my best man. -Yeah. Yeah. Um... Yeah, of course. - Yes! - [ Chuckles ] Here, um... Now you have a ring. -Actually, Jess, I, uh... -Jesus Christ. - Fumble it around. - Wow. - Yeah? - Good work, petey. - It's good? - Yeah. -Yeah. [ Both chuckle ] - Pillsbury! - Oh! No! You are done! - Aah! You can't catch me! Aah! [ Chuckles ] - Hi. - Sophie. [ Chuckles ] Oh, guess what. -What? -Jess is gonna be my best man. - Ha! - Oh! [ Chuckles ] -[ Sighs ] Hey. -Hey. -Don't worry. Jess can be your maid of honor, too. [ Chuckles ] Are you sure that this is really a good decision? -You kidding? [ Chuckles ] This is, like, the best decision. -[ Chuckles lightly] -Okay, yeah. I know it... Seems a little crazy. -Yeah. -But that's what makes it so great, you know? Sophie. [ Chuckles ] Come on. It's gonna be fun. -Yeah. We always have a lot of fun together. -Yeah, we do. -It's just... Do you think that we should be doing this because it's fun? [ Scoffs ] I mean, do we seriously think that this is going to last... You know, forever? -If we get married, it will, yeah. Sophie, it... It's gonna be great. I promise you. You're gonna love it, seriously. [ Music continues ] [ Both roaring ] [ Music intensifies ] [ Music stops ] Honk, honk. [ Chuckles ] And... Don't worry about earlier. We were both upset. You just... You need a little rest. I'll even sleep in the Jeep tonight, give you some space. -Okay. -I'll miss you. [ Chuckles lightly ] But I'll see you in the morning. -Yeah, see you then. -All right. -[ Inhales deeply ] -Hey, by the way, that dress looks "f" -ing sexy. [ Both chuckle lightly ] -Thanks. Okay. Bye. -Goodnight, beautiful. [ Wind blowing ] [ Trunk opens ] -[ Sighs ] [ Wistful ballad plays ] -[ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] [ Lid cracks open ] [ Sighs ] -Now can we go? -No. I'm an idiot. I asked her to marry me. Who else would do that but a complete idiot? I'd have been better off just hooking up with some dude at a bar. -Uh... hey, Pete. Yeah, sorry, but, uh... We're gonna... We're actually gonna take off. But, um... Stay strong, my brother. Stay strong, Jessica. [ Smooches ] Come on, bleslie. -Hey, man, uh, about that check... -Oh, yeah. -Oh, no. Forget about it. Seriously, it's on the house. And, uh, thanks for letting me hang out with you guys. It really means a lot to me. So... - Oh. Yeah, man. Of course. -Yeah. -Maybe you two should just date. [ Chuckles ] Just kidding. Just kidding. Okay. See you, dudes. -[ Sighs ] Sorry you got dumped again. [ Disc snaps ] You can go after him if you want. [ Disc clattering ] I'll be fine. Me and Sophie, we just... We weren't meant to be, you know? -God damn it. God damn it, Pete! I don't give a shit about that guy. I don't think that I even gave a shit about Brad. But I do give a shit about you, and you're not fine, because Sophie fucking left you! -Gee, thanks, Jess. I almost completely forgot. -You've got to... You've got to fucking try, Pete! -What are you doing? [ Car door closes ] Jess, what are you doing? Jess? -I'm driving home. You can stay up there if you want. -No, you're not. Don't start the car.

We're gonna live happily ever after. -Do you really want to marry the car? -No. It actually breaks down a lot. -Do you really want to marry Sophie? -[ Sighs ] Get in the car. - Right away. -They're... I mean, they're okay. They're workable. -[ Hesitantly ] Yeah. I like what you're doing. Keep up the good work. -Hey, Terry, can I come show you something? -Yeah, sure. Oh, wow!
