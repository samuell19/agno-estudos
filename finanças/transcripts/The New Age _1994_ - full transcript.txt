SIT UP STRAIGHT WITH YOUR FEET ON THE FLOOR AND EXPAND YOUR BACK. THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS TO FEEL THE EARTH'S POWER UNDER YOUR FEET, AND THEN YOUR SEAT. FEEL HOW YOU'RE SITTING, AND THEN YOUR BACK. KEEP YOUR NECK RELAXED, YOUR SHOULDERS DOWN, AND WITHOUT FORCING ANYTHING, FEEL THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD REACHING FOR THE SKY. AND NOW OBSERVE YOUR BREATH. WATCH YOUR BREATH AS THOUGH YOU'RE WATCHING SOMEONE ELSE. THEN WATCH YOUR THOUGHTS AS THOUGH YOU'RE WATCHING SOMEONE ELSE. AND DON'T CHASE AWAY ANY IMAGES THAT COME TO YOU. JUST WATCH THEM. NO, NO! WHAT? WHAT? BARRY, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? BUT, BARRY--BARRY, YOU OWE ME $38,000. BARRY--BARRY, YOU PROMISED ME THAT MONEY. WELL, THANK YOU, BARRY. GOODBYE, BARRY. WHAT DID BARRY SAY? BARRY WAS FIRED.

KATHERINE, YOU'RE DESTROYING ALL YOUR WORK. THE BANK DOESN'T NEED 100,000 BROCHURES BECAUSE THE BANK DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE. THE BANK DOESN'T EXIST BECAUSE TOO MANY OF ITS REAL ESTATE LOANS WENT BAD. ITS REAL ESTATE LOANS WENT BAD BECAUSE IT MADE LOANS FOR SHOPPING CENTERS THAT CAN'T FIND ENOUGH TENANTS. THEY CAN'T FIND TENANTS BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY SHOPPING CENTERS. THERE ARE TOO MANY SHOPPING CENTERS BECAUSE A LOT OF GREEDY FUCKS GOT LOANS FROM CORRUPT BANKS. [SOUND OF DUCKS QUACKING] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M GOING SHOPPING. DAD-- DID I ASK FOR YOUR OPINION YET? CAROL? UH, IT'S...O.K. HILLY? NO. DOESN'T WORK. YOU DON'T THINK SO, OR PETER DOESN'T THINK SO? DAD, IT'S VERY, UM, HOW DO I SAY THIS POLITELY? IT'S WORKING A LITTLE TOO HARD. SAY IT. WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE THE OWNER OF A DEL TACO FRANCHISE, LIVES IN PALM SPRINGS, GOES TO STORES FOR GUYS WHO CRUISE THE DISCO AT THE HOLIDAY INN, GOT TALKED INTO BUYING SOMETHING A LITTLE TOO SLICK, BUT IF YOU LIKE IT, BUY IT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT LOOKS GREAT. ON ME. IT REALLY DOES. WHAT'S THE DAMAGE? 925. IT'S A DEAL. HILLY, DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND? I HAVE A FINACá. ISN'T THAT ROMANTIC. DO ME A SERVICE.

PETER, CAN I SPEAK TO YOU A MINUTE? YOUR CARD'S BEEN DECLINED. A COLLECT CALL FROM REALITY. YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO REALITY? I SAY REVERSE THE CHARGES. NO, PETER, THIS HASN'T BEEN A GOOD YEAR FOR THE AGENCY! THINGS WILL GET BETTER. WE HOPE SO. THE ECONOMY--JUST HAVE TO HANG IN THERE. A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE DYING. WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE THE IMAGINATION. ENTERTAINMENT'S RECESSION-PROOF. REVENUES ARE HOLDING STEADY. COSTS KEEP GOING UP. I DO A LOT OF BUSINESS FOR THIS AGENCY. NO, YOU DON'T. YOU'RE BRINGING IN WHAT WE PAY YOU-- $300,000 A YEAR. YOU'RE DOWN TO SIX WRITERS, AND THEY'RE HACKS. THEY HAVEN'T GROWN BECAUSE YOU DON'T PUSH THEM OR YOURSELF. CLIENTS COME TO YOU, OR CAME TO YOU, BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BE AROUND YOU. YOU'RE A GUY PEOPLE WANT TO BE AROUND, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO CLOSE A DEAL ANYMORE. YOU DON'T TAKE THE DETAILS OF THE BUSINESS SERIOUSLY ANYMORE. YOU FOLLOW YOUR DICK A LITTLE TOO MUCH. I QUIT. WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU TO QUIT. WHY SHOULD I STAY AND BE INSULTED? IT ISN'T AN INSULT. IT'S--IT'S AN INTERVENTION. IT'S PART OF YOUR EDUCATION. WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU. YOU CAN TURN YOURSELF AROUND, PETER. NAH. I QUIT. THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, I'M NEVER GOING TO BE THE HEAD OF THIS COMPANY, AM I, KEVIN? PROBABLY NOT. THEN WHY IN HELL SHOULD I STAY HERE? YOU TELL ME. I'VE BEEN A LITTLE TOO CO-DEPENDENT HERE-- TAKING CARE OF EVERYBODY ELSE'S FEELINGS INSTEAD OF MY OWN. THAT'S MY PROBLEM. I'VE NOT VISUALIZED CLEARLY ENOUGH WHAT I REALLY WANT. THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE. YOU THINK I'M MAD AT YOU? I'M NOT MAD AT YOU. THIS IS ACTUALLY KIND OF A GIFT, YOU KNOW? I WELCOME THIS. I WELCOME WHAT MY NEXT STEP IN MY JOURNEY WILL BE, AND SO... I QUIT. GOODBYE, KEVIN. GOODBYE, GUYS. DO THIS FOR ME. ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS FOR ME? COME FOR ME, BABY. YES, COME FOR ME. COME FOR ME. YOU CAN COME FOR ME. YOU'RE SO SWEET. OHH! SORRY. SORRY. ARE YOU HAPPY NOW? ARE YOU HAPPY? YOU TOOK A BRAVE LEAP TODAY, YOU KNOW. HELL WITH THEM. FACE IT. THEY'RE NOT A GOOD AGENCY. YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. YOU'RE JUST SCARED. IT'S NORMAL TO FEEL SCARED, PETER. I'M NOT SCARED. DO I LOOK SCARED? I'M NOT SCARED. DON'T ASK ME TO GO BY HOW YOU LOOK. YOU ALWAYS LOOK GREAT. THAT'S ONE OF THE SCARIEST THINGS ABOUT YOU.

THERE'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG. PLEASE. COULD YOU TELL THE TRUTH ONCE IN YOUR LIFE? YOU WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE IT. OH, O.K. O.K. SO, HOW HAVE I HELD YOU BACK? YOU HAVEN'T HELD ME BACK. ONE PERSON CANNOT HOLD ANOTHER PERSON BACK. THAT'S A JUDGMENT. THERE'S NO VICTIM HERE. I FEEL HELD BACK. THESE ARE MY FEELINGS. LIKE WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT. THAT HURTS ME. I FEEL HURT BY THAT. MAYBE THAT'S MY WAKE-UP CALL. I REALIZE MY LIFE ISN'T ON TRACK. MAYBE I'M ON A DETOUR, A SUBPATH. SO I NEED SUPPORT. I DON'T FEEL ANY SUPPORT FROM YOU. LIKE QUITTING MY JOB-- THAT'S A SUBPATH. DO I HEAR, "GREAT, HONEY"? "I'LL HELP YOU FIND YOUR DREAM." NO. I HEAR, "WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO FOR MONEY?" WHAT IS MONEY? HUH? MONEY ISN'T MONEY. MONEY'S JUST AN EXPRESSION OF SOMETHING ELSE. MONEY WILL EXPRESS ITSELF. IF WE NEED MONEY, MONEY WILL EXPRESS ITSELF. IT'S LIKE LOVE. IF THERE'S LOVE HERE, LOVE WILL EXPRESS ITSELF. I JUST NEED SUPPORT, KATHERINE. I NEED A PUSH. I NEED A GODDAMN PUSH. YOU'D FALL OVER. YOU'D BREAK. YOU'D LIKE TO THINK SO, WOULDN'T YOU? I MEAN, I'M TRYING TO GET TO SOMETHING HERE, TO THE BOTTOM OF SOMETHING. YOU COULD AT LEAST BE NICE. IT'S YOUR BIG WEAPON, ISN'T IT? IT'S WHAT EVERYBODY ADORES ABOUT YOU. I WASN'T NICE LAST NIGHT. NO. [CHUCKLING] YOU WERE BAD. DON'T BE CUTE. YOU QUIT YOUR JOB WITH NO PLACE ELSE TO GO. YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BE CUTE. IT'S JUST MY INNER CHILD SHOWING THROUGH. YOUR INNER CHILD IS RUNNING US INTO BANKRUPTCY. WHY DON'T YOU GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR INNER ADULT? WHY ARE WE SO AWFUL? YOU'RE THE MYSTIC IN THIS FAMILY. AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO THINK POSITIVELY? I'M TRYING, LIKE I'M TRYING TO FIND WORK, YOU KNOW? BUT I'VE CALLED EVERYBODY. NOBODY NEEDS A GRAPHIC DESIGNER. WE HAVE TO FIND SOME WORK, PETER. WE HAVE ABOUT 30 DAYS LEFT IN THE BANK, AND THEN WE'RE BROKE. AND IF WE DON'T FIND SOME MONEY, WE'LL HAVE TO START SELLING PAINTINGS, ONE BY ONE. AND THEN THE HOUSE. YEAH, ALL RIGHT. CUT TO THE CHASE. I HATE THAT LINE. YOU GONNA CRITICIZE EVERYTHING I SAY, OR ARE YOU GONNA TALK TO ME? SHOULD WE GET A DIVORCE? WHAT? WHO'S TALKING ABOUT A DIVORCE, KATHERINE? I DON'T KNOW. YOU SLEEP WITH A GUY ONCE, AND YOU WANT A DIVORCE? ARE YOU IN LOVE? NO. I NEED SOME SPACE. SPACE. WE BOTH NEED SPACE. I'M SO IN LOVE WITH YOU, PETER, BUT I'M GOING OUT OF MY MIND. IF I HAD SOME MONEY, I'D BUY A CONDO, YOU KNOW, BUT I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD RENT. I CAN'T KICK YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE. IT'S YOURS AS MUCH AS MINE. WE'VE GOT TO GET SOME MONEY, PETER. WELL, I'M TRYING, BABY. YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING, O.K.? WE HAVE TO TRY HARDER. PETER... THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING. WE BOTH STAY LIVING IN THE HOUSE, BUT WE HAVE OUR OWN LIVES. YOU KNOW? WE LIVE SEPARATELY. JUST FOR A WHILE. O.K.? I COULD TAKE MY OFFICE, AND YOU COULD TAKE THE BEDROOM. JUST FOR A WHILE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU TAKE THE BEDROOM. THAT'S GENEROUS. THAT'S VERY GENEROUS... BUT IT WAS MY IDEA. YOU TAKE THE BEDROOM. O.K. O.K. MAYBE WE SHOULD GO DANCING. GOD, IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE I'VE BEEN DANCING. WANT TO GO DANCING? YEAH. I'D LIKE TO DO THAT. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF? POVERTY. WORK. I'M NOT AFRAID OF WORK. YOU WORK. I WORK. NO. I MEAN REAL WORK. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AFRAID OF-- JOBS, REGULAR JOBS. WORKING FOR A BOSS ON A SALARY, BY THE HOUR. NO EXPENSE ACCOUNT. NO EXPENSE ACCOUNT? YIKES. GOD, I'D KILL MYSELF. REALLY? WHAT JEAN MEANS IS THAT EVERYONE IS GOOD AT SOMETHING, BUT SOMETIMES THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMIT WHAT THAT IS BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULDN'T DO. SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOOD AT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IF THE TWO OF YOU COULD DO ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, IF YOU COULD GO ANYWHERE, WHERE WOULD YOU GO? WHAT WOULD YOU DO? SHOPPING. OH, MY GOD. WHAT DID I JUST SAY? WE'D GO SHOPPING. AH HA HA! THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOOD AT-- SHOPPING AND TALKING. YEAH. WE'D GO SHOPPING. THERE'S YOUR ANSWER. YOU KNOW, IN CHINESE, THE WORD FOR "CRISIS" IS THE SAME AS THE WORD FOR "OPPORTUNITY." IF I ASK HIM TO EXPLAIN, HE'LL SAY, LIVE WITH THE QUESTION. NO. I KNOW WHAT HE MEANS. IT'S SO... IT'S SO CLEAR. IT'S BRILLIANT. HE WANTS US TO OPEN A STORE. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? SHOPPING AND TALKING-- A STORE. WHAT KIND OF STORE? WHAT ARE WE SELLING? LIVE WITH THE QUESTION. AN EYEGLASS STORE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? GLASSES. YOU NEED A SPECIAL LICENSE FOR THAT. WELL... TECHNICALLY, ANYWAY. I KNOW. I KNOW. WHAT ABOUT, UH... A FRANCHISE FOR A COPY STORE? OH, GOD. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? OH, GOD.

PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREET WEREN'T BORN THERE. YOU KEEP FALLING, THERE'S NO BOTTOM. THINK NAVAJOS HAD CHILDREN WHENEVER THEY WANTED? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE WERE ALL BORN BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WAS EXPANDING. NOW IT'S COLLAPSING. THE WORLD DOESN'T NEED US. IN THE OLD DAYS, LAWS OF NATURE KEPT EVERYTHING IN BALANCE. PEOPLE WERE IN HARMONY WITH NATURE.
