SIT UP STRAIGHT WITH YOUR FEET ON THE FLOOR AND EXPAND YOUR BACK. THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS TO FEEL THE EARTH'S POWER UNDER YOUR FEET, AND THEN YOUR SEAT. FEEL HOW YOU'RE SITTING, AND THEN YOUR BACK. KEEP YOUR NECK RELAXED, YOUR SHOULDERS DOWN, AND WITHOUT FORCING ANYTHING, FEEL THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD REACHING FOR THE SKY. AND NOW OBSERVE YOUR BREATH. WATCH YOUR BREATH AS THOUGH YOU'RE WATCHING SOMEONE ELSE. THEN WATCH YOUR THOUGHTS AS THOUGH YOU'RE WATCHING SOMEONE ELSE. AND DON'T CHASE AWAY ANY IMAGES THAT COME TO YOU. JUST WATCH THEM. NO, NO! WHAT? WHAT? BARRY, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? BUT, BARRY--BARRY, YOU OWE ME $38,000. BARRY--BARRY, YOU PROMISED ME THAT MONEY. WELL, THANK YOU, BARRY. GOODBYE, BARRY. WHAT DID BARRY SAY? BARRY WAS FIRED.

KATHERINE, YOU'RE DESTROYING ALL YOUR WORK. THE BANK DOESN'T NEED 100,000 BROCHURES BECAUSE THE BANK DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE. THE BANK DOESN'T EXIST BECAUSE TOO MANY OF ITS REAL ESTATE LOANS WENT BAD. ITS REAL ESTATE LOANS WENT BAD BECAUSE IT MADE LOANS FOR SHOPPING CENTERS THAT CAN'T FIND ENOUGH TENANTS. THEY CAN'T FIND TENANTS BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY SHOPPING CENTERS. THERE ARE TOO MANY SHOPPING CENTERS BECAUSE A LOT OF GREEDY FUCKS GOT LOANS FROM CORRUPT BANKS. [SOUND OF DUCKS QUACKING] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M GOING SHOPPING. DAD-- DID I ASK FOR YOUR OPINION YET? CAROL? UH, IT'S...O.K. HILLY? NO. DOESN'T WORK. YOU DON'T THINK SO, OR PETER DOESN'T THINK SO? DAD, IT'S VERY, UM, HOW DO I SAY THIS POLITELY? IT'S WORKING A LITTLE TOO HARD. SAY IT. WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE THE OWNER OF A DEL TACO FRANCHISE, LIVES IN PALM SPRINGS, GOES TO STORES FOR GUYS WHO CRUISE THE DISCO AT THE HOLIDAY INN, GOT TALKED INTO BUYING SOMETHING A LITTLE TOO SLICK, BUT IF YOU LIKE IT, BUY IT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT LOOKS GREAT. ON ME. IT REALLY DOES. WHAT'S THE DAMAGE? 925. IT'S A DEAL. HILLY, DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND? I HAVE A FINACÃ¡. ISN'T THAT ROMANTIC. DO ME A SERVICE. ANSWER THIS QUESTION. HOW ARE YOUR MORALS? DAD. I'M WORKING ON THEM. GOOD ANSWER. ISN'T CAROL BEAUTIFUL? YEAH, IN A QUICK-TRIP-TO-ACAPULCO KIND OF WAY. ACAPULCO? PALM SPRINGS. PETER, CAN I SPEAK TO YOU A MINUTE? YOUR CARD'S BEEN DECLINED. A COLLECT CALL FROM REALITY. YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO REALITY? I SAY REVERSE THE CHARGES. NO, PETER, THIS HASN'T BEEN A GOOD YEAR FOR THE AGENCY! THINGS WILL GET BETTER. WE HOPE SO. THE ECONOMY--JUST HAVE TO HANG IN THERE. A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE DYING. WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE THE IMAGINATION. ENTERTAINMENT'S RECESSION-PROOF. REVENUES ARE HOLDING STEADY. COSTS KEEP GOING UP. I DO A LOT OF BUSINESS FOR THIS AGENCY. NO, YOU DON'T. YOU'RE BRINGING IN WHAT WE PAY YOU-- $300,000 A YEAR. YOU'RE DOWN TO SIX WRITERS, AND THEY'RE HACKS. THEY HAVEN'T GROWN BECAUSE YOU DON'T PUSH THEM OR YOURSELF. CLIENTS COME TO YOU, OR CAME TO YOU, BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BE AROUND YOU. YOU'RE A GUY PEOPLE WANT TO BE AROUND, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO CLOSE A DEAL ANYMORE. YOU DON'T TAKE THE DETAILS OF THE BUSINESS SERIOUSLY ANYMORE. YOU FOLLOW YOUR DICK A LITTLE TOO MUCH. I QUIT. WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU TO QUIT. WHY SHOULD I STAY AND BE INSULTED? IT ISN'T AN INSULT. IT'S--IT'S AN INTERVENTION. IT'S PART OF YOUR EDUCATION. WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU. YOU CAN TURN YOURSELF AROUND, PETER. NAH. I QUIT. THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, I'M NEVER GOING TO BE THE HEAD OF THIS COMPANY, AM I, KEVIN? PROBABLY NOT. THEN WHY IN HELL SHOULD I STAY HERE? YOU TELL ME. I'VE BEEN A LITTLE TOO CO-DEPENDENT HERE-- TAKING CARE OF EVERYBODY ELSE'S FEELINGS INSTEAD OF MY OWN. THAT'S MY PROBLEM. I'VE NOT VISUALIZED CLEARLY ENOUGH WHAT I REALLY WANT. THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE. YOU THINK I'M MAD AT YOU? I'M NOT MAD AT YOU. THIS IS ACTUALLY KIND OF A GIFT, YOU KNOW? I WELCOME THIS. I WELCOME WHAT MY NEXT STEP IN MY JOURNEY WILL BE, AND SO... I QUIT. GOODBYE, KEVIN. GOODBYE, GUYS. DO THIS FOR ME. ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS FOR ME? COME FOR ME, BABY. YES, COME FOR ME. COME FOR ME. YOU CAN COME FOR ME. YOU'RE SO SWEET. OHH! SORRY. SORRY. ARE YOU HAPPY NOW? ARE YOU HAPPY? YOU TOOK A BRAVE LEAP TODAY, YOU KNOW. HELL WITH THEM. FACE IT. THEY'RE NOT A GOOD AGENCY. YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. YOU'RE JUST SCARED. IT'S NORMAL TO FEEL SCARED, PETER. I'M NOT SCARED. DO I LOOK SCARED? I'M NOT SCARED. DON'T ASK ME TO GO BY HOW YOU LOOK. YOU ALWAYS LOOK GREAT. THAT'S ONE OF THE SCARIEST THINGS ABOUT YOU. NO ONE EVER KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU, ALISON. YOU'RE SO SWEET. I'LL CALL YOU. [DOOR CLOSES] "HAP KNOWS I FOUND THE GOLD. HE'S KEEPING ME A PRISONER." PRISONER? I ALWAYS SAID THAT HAP WAS NO GOOD. [HORSES RUNNING] [GUNSHOTS] IT'S INTERESTING, ISN'T IT? WHAT? LASER DISCS ARE BETTER THAN VIDEOTAPE. THAT'S OBVIOUS, BUT VINYL--REAL RECORDS SOUND BETTER THAN CDs. DIGITAL IS WEIRD. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? THE GYM. OHH. YOU MUST'VE HAD QUITE A WORKOUT. I DID. I WAS, UH-- I HAVE A LOT OF TENSION. HMM. YOU NEEDED TO SWEAT.

CONGRATULATIONS, PETER. YOU'VE BEEN SELECTED AS A GRAND-PRIZE WINNER IN A NATIONWIDE COMPETITION, AND YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR ONE OF THREE FANTASTIC GRAND PRIZES. ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF?

YOU QUIT WITHOUT TELLING ME YOU WERE GONNA QUIT? I'M TELLING YOU NOW. PETER! WHAT? THIS WAS A BAD TIME FOR YOU TO QUIT. I LOST MY BIGGEST ACCOUNT TODAY. EVERYBODY'S CUTTING BACK, YOU KNOW? THERE REALLY IS NO WORK ANYMORE. WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME? BY THE TIME I PAY FOR MATERIALS AND STAFF, I'M NOT EVEN BREAKING EVEN, AND NOW YOU GO AND QUIT. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? THE QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? THAT'S THE QUESTION. WE'RE A COUPLE. YOU'RE NOT BEHAVING LIKE SOMEONE IN A COUPLE, PETER. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO QUIT. WHAT DID YOU BUY? NOTHING. EXPENSIVE NOTHING. YOUR BUSINESS IS CRASHING, AND YOU GO SHOPPING? YOU'D DO THE SAME, AND THEY WERE ON SALE. DON'T APOLOGIZE. LET ME SEE. NO. I JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU BOUGHT. IT'S ALL GOING BACK. WHAT'S THIS?

ONE PERSON CANNOT HOLD ANOTHER PERSON BACK. THAT'S A JUDGMENT. THERE'S NO VICTIM HERE. I FEEL HELD BACK. THESE ARE MY FEELINGS. LIKE WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT. THAT HURTS ME. I FEEL HURT BY THAT. MAYBE THAT'S MY WAKE-UP CALL. I REALIZE MY LIFE ISN'T ON TRACK. MAYBE I'M ON A DETOUR, A SUBPATH. SO I NEED SUPPORT. I DON'T FEEL ANY SUPPORT FROM YOU. LIKE QUITTING MY JOB-- THAT'S A SUBPATH. DO I HEAR, "GREAT, HONEY"? "I'LL HELP YOU FIND YOUR DREAM." NO. I HEAR, "WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO FOR MONEY?" WHAT IS MONEY? HUH? MONEY ISN'T MONEY. MONEY'S JUST AN EXPRESSION OF SOMETHING ELSE. MONEY WILL EXPRESS ITSELF. IF WE NEED MONEY, MONEY WILL EXPRESS ITSELF. IT'S LIKE LOVE. IF THERE'S LOVE HERE, LOVE WILL EXPRESS ITSELF. I JUST NEED SUPPORT, KATHERINE. I NEED A PUSH. I NEED A GODDAMN PUSH. YOU'D FALL OVER. YOU'D BREAK. YOU'D LIKE TO THINK SO, WOULDN'T YOU? I MEAN, I'M TRYING TO GET TO SOMETHING HERE, TO THE BOTTOM OF SOMETHING. YOU COULD AT LEAST BE NICE.

YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BE CUTE. IT'S JUST MY INNER CHILD SHOWING THROUGH. YOUR INNER CHILD IS RUNNING US INTO BANKRUPTCY. WHY DON'T YOU GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR INNER ADULT? WHY ARE WE SO AWFUL? YOU'RE THE MYSTIC IN THIS FAMILY. AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO THINK POSITIVELY? I'M TRYING, LIKE I'M TRYING TO FIND WORK, YOU KNOW? BUT I'VE CALLED EVERYBODY. NOBODY NEEDS A GRAPHIC DESIGNER. WE HAVE TO FIND SOME WORK, PETER. WE HAVE ABOUT 30 DAYS LEFT IN THE BANK, AND THEN WE'RE BROKE. AND IF WE DON'T FIND SOME MONEY, WE'LL HAVE TO START SELLING PAINTINGS, ONE BY ONE. AND THEN THE HOUSE. YEAH, ALL RIGHT. CUT TO THE CHASE. I HATE THAT LINE. YOU GONNA CRITICIZE EVERYTHING I SAY, OR ARE YOU GONNA TALK TO ME? SHOULD WE GET A DIVORCE? WHAT? WHO'S TALKING ABOUT A DIVORCE, KATHERINE? I DON'T KNOW. YOU SLEEP WITH A GUY ONCE, AND YOU WANT A DIVORCE? ARE YOU IN LOVE? NO. I NEED SOME SPACE. SPACE. WE BOTH NEED SPACE. I'M SO IN LOVE WITH YOU, PETER, BUT I'M GOING OUT OF MY MIND. IF I HAD SOME MONEY, I'D BUY A CONDO, YOU KNOW, BUT I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD RENT. I CAN'T KICK YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE. IT'S YOURS AS MUCH AS MINE. WE'VE GOT TO GET SOME MONEY, PETER. WELL, I'M TRYING, BABY. YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING, O.K.? WE HAVE TO TRY HARDER. PETER... THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING. WE BOTH STAY LIVING IN THE HOUSE, BUT WE HAVE OUR OWN LIVES. YOU KNOW? WE LIVE SEPARATELY. JUST FOR A WHILE. O.K.? I COULD TAKE MY OFFICE, AND YOU COULD TAKE THE BEDROOM. JUST FOR A WHILE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU TAKE THE BEDROOM. THAT'S GENEROUS. THAT'S VERY GENEROUS... BUT IT WAS MY IDEA. YOU TAKE THE BEDROOM. O.K. O.K. MAYBE WE SHOULD GO DANCING. GOD, IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE I'VE BEEN DANCING. WANT TO GO DANCING? YEAH. I'D LIKE TO DO THAT. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF? POVERTY. WORK. I'M NOT AFRAID OF WORK. YOU WORK. I WORK. NO. I MEAN REAL WORK. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AFRAID OF-- JOBS, REGULAR JOBS. WORKING FOR A BOSS ON A SALARY, BY THE HOUR. NO EXPENSE ACCOUNT. NO EXPENSE ACCOUNT? YIKES. GOD, I'D KILL MYSELF. REALLY? WHAT JEAN MEANS IS THAT EVERYONE IS GOOD AT SOMETHING, BUT SOMETIMES THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMIT WHAT THAT IS BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULDN'T DO. SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOOD AT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IF THE TWO OF YOU COULD DO ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, IF YOU COULD GO ANYWHERE, WHERE WOULD YOU GO? WHAT WOULD YOU DO? SHOPPING. OH, MY GOD. WHAT DID I JUST SAY? WE'D GO SHOPPING. AH HA HA! THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOOD AT-- SHOPPING AND TALKING. YEAH. WE'D GO SHOPPING. THERE'S YOUR ANSWER. YOU KNOW, IN CHINESE, THE WORD FOR "CRISIS" IS THE SAME AS THE WORD FOR "OPPORTUNITY." IF I ASK HIM TO EXPLAIN, HE'LL SAY, LIVE WITH THE QUESTION. NO. I KNOW WHAT HE MEANS. IT'S SO... IT'S SO CLEAR. IT'S BRILLIANT. HE WANTS US TO OPEN A STORE. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? SHOPPING AND TALKING-- A STORE. WHAT KIND OF STORE? WHAT ARE WE SELLING? LIVE WITH THE QUESTION. AN EYEGLASS STORE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

THE STORE STOCKS OUR TASTE-- A FEW GOOD SHIRTS, DRESSES. BUT HOW'S IT GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER STORE? I KNEW YOU'D ASK THAT QUESTION. THE STOCK CHANGES ALL THE TIME SO THE CUSTOMERS KEEP COMING BACK TO SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT FROM WEEK TO WEEK. IT'S WHERE PEOPLE GO WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE TIME, BUT THEY COME TO US WHEN THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR. YEAH. WHAT THEY NEED. IT'S PERFECT. LISTEN, SLOGAN-- HIPOCRACY...

IT'S NOT ABOUT A DEBATE. I THINK PETER WANTS SOME COMFORT. THAT'S WHAT RITUALS ARE FOR. SUICIDE. SELF-DELIVERANCE. I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T GO TO HEAVEN IF YOU KILLED YOURSELF. THE TRADITIONS DON'T AGREE. I THINK YOU CAN, IF YOU'RE CLEAR ABOUT IT. IF YOU'RE NOT, YOU COME BACK AND YOU'VE LEARNED SOMETHING. IT SCARES ME. IT TAKES COURAGE. IT TAKES JUST AS MUCH COURAGE TO DIE AS TO LIVE. [BELL CHIMES] [CLASSICAL GUITAR PLAYS] KATHERINE? KATHERINE, WHAT DO YOU THINK? HUH? WE DON'T NEED A SIGN IN THE WINDOW, DO WE? NOT YET, DO WE?

WE HAVE TO SELL THAT PAINTING. NO. WE COULD GET 75, 100, MAYBE EVEN 150. NO! WE HAVE TO SELL IT! THAT'S MY FIRST PAINTING! WE ARE SELLING SOMETHING. WE'VE GOT TO SELL IT. I'LL GET IT FROM MY FATHER. OH, PLEASE, PLEASE. HE WILL NEVER GIVE YOU THE MONEY. THAT'S A REAL ORIGINAL THOUGHT. YOU OUGHT TO WRITE THAT DOWN. YOU BET. [BESEME MUCHO PLAYS] HIYA, DAD. COME IN. COME IN. WELL, HOW'S THE STORE?

[ALISON] I THOUGHT YOU DID. [PETER] YOU KNEW. I SUSPECTED. [ALISON] THAT IT WAS ME? [KATHERINE] NO. I THOUGHT YOU DID. NO. NOT ALISON. I DIDN'T THINK SHE WAS YOUR TYPE. I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU'D GO FOR SOMEONE TALLER. [LAUGHS] [ALISON] DO YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS MARRIED? [PETER] WHO? [ALISON] KATHERINE. NO--YES. OH, TECHNICALLY. BUT YOU'RE WITH SOMEONE ELSE NOW. RIGHT. HOW'S HE FEEL ABOUT THAT? DIRTY. VERY DIRTY. SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? WHO? [PETER] ALISON. [ALISON] IT MEANS... IT MEANS I NEED TO CALL A CAB. MISHA? YES, KATHERINE? I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH ANY MEN RIGHT NOW. GOOD NIGHT. STUPID... STUPID... STUPID... STUPID... STUPID... [HORN HONKS] WHAT LUCK. THIS IS MY FRIEND CATHERINE. CATHERINE, THIS IS PETER.

THE TRUTH. âª USE MY MIND âª DON'T TELL A SOUL âª YOU KNOW THEY GOT A PLACE TO GROW âª âª YOU KNOW THE STUDENT... âªâª [MOANING] EVERYONE HERE HAS A QUESTION. YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A QUESTION. THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTIONS, TO QUESTIONS YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU HAD, IS THROUGH THE BODY. YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE. ALL YOU NEED IS A BODY. BOB, DOES THAT MEAN WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING? ALL THE ANSWERS ARE THERE INSIDE YOU. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS? NO. YES, YOU DO. PETER, COME IN. IN A MINUTE. THE WATER'S WARM. IT'S FUNNY HOW PEOPLE CONNECT, ISN'T IT? ANOTHER LINE AFTER THE MORALS QUESTION? IT ISN'T A LINE. IT IS. IT'S TRUE. THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN US. SOMETHING-- SOMETHING SPARKED. YOU KNOW THAT. SURE. IT HAPPENS A LOT. YOU CAN'T GIVE IN TO IT EVERY TIME. YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS. AND WHAT ARE YOUR INSTINCTS NOW? MY INSTINCTS? MY INSTINCTS ARE... IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT, YOU HAVE TO TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS. NO, I'M A LITTLE TOO SHY. IT'S ONLY A HARD-ON, PETER. EVERYONE HERE KNOWS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT? GROUP SEX.

WE'RE THREE MONTHS BEHIND ON THE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS FOR THE HOUSE. WE'RE GOING TO BE FORECLOSED. PETER... WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THE HOUSE. WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE SOMETHING. I FEEL LIKE KILLING MYSELF. I REALLY FEEL LIKE KILLING MYSELF. IT'S NOT A JOKE. I'M COMPLETELY CONFUSED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO FAIL. I DON'T SEE ANY WAY OUT. WE'VE GOT TO HOLD ON TO LIFE. WHY? LAURA KILLED HERSELF. LAURA? LAURA WAS IN PAIN. SHE WAS DYING IN PAIN. I AM IN PAIN. I'M IN PAIN. EVERY SECOND I FEEL LIKE I WAS BORN FOR NO REASON, THAT MY LIFE'S JUST ANOTHER LIFE. WHAT CAN'T I GO THE WAY SHE WENT? WHY CAN'T I JUST CHECK OUT? MAYBE LOSE A LITTLE KARMA FOR IT, BUT COME BACK AGAIN AS A TREE OR SOMETHING. THEN WORK MY WAY BACK UP THE LADDER. MAYBE I'M BEING PUNISHED IN THIS LIFE FOR SOME SHIT IN MY PAST. MAYBE I'M SUPPOSED TO DIE NOW. MAYBE DEATH IS CALLING ME. THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, ANYWAY. THERE'S A VOICE-- IT'S THE ANGEL OF DEATH. HE'S CALLING ME, SAYING, "HERE. I'M YOUR FRIEND. JOIN ME." DON'T YOU HEAR THAT VOICE? YOU HAVEN'T EARNED YOUR DEATH. DON'T YOU HEAR THAT VOICE? NO. YOU'RE LYING. YOU ARE LYING. SOMETIMES. RIGHT, SOMETIMES. EVERYBODY DOES. NOT THE WAY WE DO, NO. WE'RE A LITTLE CLOSER, YOU AND ME. AND I BET YOUR FANTASY IS PRETTY WELL WORKED OUT, TOO. I'LL BET YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR. WELL, I KNOW IT ISN'T BLACK. BLACK'S TOO OBVIOUS. SOMETHING SUMMERY. A JUNE WEDDING. A PRINT. FLOWERS. BUT ELEGANT. FOR THE EVENING, NOT THE AFTERNOON. HOW ABOUT YOU? WELL, I HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT BLACK TIE, BUT... YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT. YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OUT LOOKING LIKE A HEAD WAITER. NO, THAT'S TRUE. BUT THE STYLISH YOUNG PRESIDENT OF A BIG FOUNDATION... THAT'S SORT OF ROMANTIC. I THINK I ALWAYS JUST PRETENDED I WAS HAPPY. YEAH, THAT SHOULD WORK. JERI WILL LOOK PRETTY GOOD IN THIS, DON'T YOU THINK? OH, THESE ARE JUST FANTASIES. JERI WILL LOOK AWESOME. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? SHE'D LOOK GOOD. CASH OR CHARGE? PLASTIC. THAT'S 70% OFF, RIGHT? YES. HOMELESSNESS IS A POSSIBILITY. I KNOW THAT. HOMELESS... SLEEPING IN OUR CAR, WASHING IN THE BATHROOM AT A LIBRARY, EATING GARBAGE. THAT COULD HAPPEN. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO! PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREET WEREN'T BORN THERE. YOU KEEP FALLING, THERE'S NO BOTTOM. THINK NAVAJOS HAD CHILDREN WHENEVER THEY WANTED? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE WERE ALL BORN BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WAS EXPANDING. NOW IT'S COLLAPSING. THE WORLD DOESN'T NEED US. IN THE OLD DAYS, LAWS OF NATURE KEPT EVERYTHING IN BALANCE. PEOPLE WERE IN HARMONY WITH NATURE. NATURE'S DEAD. THERE'S NO MORE HARMONY. WE'RE ALL POINTLESS! WILL THAT BE ALL? YEAH. GREAT. THANKS. YEAH, THANKS A LOT. I'M GOING TO LONE PINE FOR A FEW DAYS. I NEED SOME AIR.

YOU CAN HEAR THE SILENCE. THE SILENCE IN WHICH WE CHOSE TO BE BORN... THE SILENCE IN WHICH WE CHOSE OUR PARENTS... THE SILENCE IN WHICH WE CHOOSE OUR LIVES. THE SILENCE IN WHICH WE CAN CHOOSE OUR DEATH. CHOOSE OUR DEATH? TO BE BORN HUMAN AND NOT A SNAKE... IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. ASK YOURSELF... WHO WISHES TO DIE? WHO? FOR WHOM? WOULD YOUR DEATH BE APPROPRIATE? WOULD YOUR DEATH BE ADEQUATE? I WILL LEAVE MY ANSWER OPEN, BUT YOU SHOULD GO TO THE END OF YOUR QUESTION. IF YOU EVER OPEN ANOTHER STORE, PETER... WATCH THE LOCATION.
