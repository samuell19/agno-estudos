(funky jazz music) - Hi, Ed! Hello, Ed! What's your hurry, young fella? - Hi, Cecil. I'm just getting in out of the cold. To warm us up. - Oh, no thanks. None for me. You know I'm on the wagon. - Okay, Cecil, but you keep it under your hat. I don't wanna share it with none of them bums at the hotel. - Sure, Ed, I don't blame you. (tense music) (woman gasps) - Come on, get lost! - What's the matter with him? - He's drunk. (tense music) (funky jazz music) - [Doctor] Name's Ed Gurney, age 43, no known address. We've had him before. - For what? - Bad booze, malnutrition. We pump him out, give him a meal, and tie him loose. All we can do. - What happened this time? - What he was drinking this time wasn't just bad, it was poison. Escadine would be my guess. - Escadine, where would he get that? - In a bottle of scotch. Royal Inverness, he said. - But nobody would go to all that trouble just to murder a poor old rummy. - What happened to the bottle, Doc? - He never got around to saying, but you better find in a hurry or we'll have a run of dead winos. (tense music) - Ed? Ed? - Joe, I want a search party, the 300 block of Pacific Street. Need a dozen men within a half an hour. - A half hour, a dozen men. Dan, where am I gonna get 'em? - [Dan] I don't care where you get 'em, just get 'em. We gotta find that bottle now. Did you know him? - No, we didn't know him, just a bum. Probably lived somewhere on Pacific Street. - He coulda lived in a flop house anywhere. - There's no sign of a bottle, huh? - No, but he could've dumped it before we got the call. He was on Church Street when we first spotted him. - Was he alone? - Yes, sir. We spotted him in a hotel entrance. He took off when we slowed down. - Maybe he dumped the bottle when he saw you. - Well, we checked, didn't find anything. - Church and what? - Church and Powell. - Alright, thank you. (tense music) - Dan. Look at this. Royal Inverness scotch. - "Happy birthday from Donald Esseltine." Esseltine. - Esseltine? There can only be one in Santa Luisa. He's been playing piano in Eddie's Bar for years. - Let's go. (gentle organ music) - You on break, Esseltine? We wanna talk to you. - Some break. Later, pal, huh? I'm listening. - Now. Please. - Over there. - Alright, what? What do you wanna see me for? - 'Cause you're the only Donald Esseltine in Santa Luisa. Now, did you fill this out? - Now, wait a minute. You guys may not like my sense of humor, but you can't bust me for that. - Some sense of humor sending a bottle of poisoned whiskey to somebody. - What? - A bottle of poisoned whiskey. - Why you're crazy, nuts! - Your name is on the card. - So what? I never sent that package to anybody. My package came from Mickelberry's Department Store. - The paper's from Mickelberry's. - That isn't my package. Well, it isn't. Mickelberry's has a record of what I sent. - We'll check on that. Now, who'd you send the gift to? - (sighs) Dr. Michael Serling. - The surgeon? - Yeah. - What'd you send him? - A carving knife. What else would you send to a butcher? That's right, jack. He claimed he had to cut my hand off. But I never will know, will I? - He's got a right to be bitter. Not too many jobs for one-handed piano players. - Tell you one thing, Dr. Serling's no butcher. He's a magician. I wrecked my knee in the Cal State game when I was in college, he put it back together. He's quite a man. This is Car Nine. Katy around? - [Katy] Hello, Dan, this is Katy speaking. - Hey, Katy, is there any word on that bottle yet? - [Katy] Not yet. - Tell Joe to cover the Skid Row area. Anybody with a bottle, check 'em out. (tense music) - Hey, Harry, boy, look at this. Royal Inverness. - Cecil, I thought you were off the stuff. - I am, I am. Almost three weeks now. This is Ed's. He musta lost it. Is he upstairs? - Haven't seen him come in yet. - Well. I'll just wait for him in my room. - Better leave the bottle here. - Don't you worry about me. I ain't falling off the wagon this time, no sir. No, sirree! (people chattering) - Leona? That's quite a birthday gift you've given him. It's a shame he's not here. - He said it was an emergency. I suppose it can't be helped. (doorbell chimes) Excuse me. - Mrs. Serling? I'm Lieutenant August. This is Sergeant Wilentz. Is your husband at home? - No, I'm sorry. Is anything wrong? - Could you tell us where he is? - He said at the hospital, an emergency appendectomy. - Thank you. - Officer, can't you tell me what's wrong? Is Michael all right? - Yes, he's all right. - Then someone else is in trouble? - Yes. Goodnight. (guests chattering) (tense music) Any idea what time Dr. Serling's gonna finish? - Two and a half minutes. - Two and a half? - He's closing now. The great man has a flat rating. He never works overtime. - What if there are complications? - (sighs) Dr. Serling doesn't allow complications. Who are you guys? - Police department. I'm Lieutenant August, this is Sergeant Wilentz. - Dr. Rodell. - Doctor. - Sergeant. - Doctor Rodell. - Say, uh, you guys wouldn't be going to bust him, would you? - Hardly. - That's too bad. - [August] Long time, Doctor, I wasn't sure you'd remember. - Oh, 1959, compound fracture of the left knee, wasn't it? How is it? - Fine. - Doctor, did you get a bottle of Royal Inverness from a Donald Esseltine for your birthday? - I think there was a bottle. I don't know who sent it. I haven't had a chance to open any of my office presents yet. - Can we see them? - Well, what is this all about? I don't understand. - Can we see them? - Yeah, right in my office here. Well, the bottle was here earlier. Somebody's walked off with it, I suppose. - There's nothing there with Mickelberry's paper, Dan. There's no bottle, no knife, nothing. - Check with Mickelberry's in the morning, find out what Esseltine bought. - Dan, what's this all about? - You know a man named Ed Gurney? - Yeah. He's a patient from a long time ago. He's been down on his luck for years. Sometimes I pay his rent, sometimes he comes around for handouts. Oh, now I understand, you think Ed stole the bottle. Oh, come on, don't tell me a lieutenant of homicide comes around to invest-- - Doctor. That bottle of whiskey was full of Escadine. - Escadine, that's a deadly poison. - Ed Gurney drank some and died. - Ed is dead? - We believe that bottle of whiskey was meant for you, to kill you. - To kill me? Well, that's nonsense, that's ridiculous. Donald Esseltine? (stammering) That's impossible. - Nothing's impossible. - But I mean nobody would want to kill me. - Nobody? (dramatic music) Doctor? - Lieutenant, I have no enemies, none. There's been some terrible mistake. - There may have been a mistake, Doctor, but there's no mistake about that bottle of whiskey. It's full of Escadine, enough to kill a hundred people. Now, have you got any idea where Ed Gurney lived? - Yeah, the Savoy Hotel, why? - Maybe that bottle's still there. (tense music) (brakes screech) Ed Gurney, what room is he in? - He's not in. - [Dan] Just give us the key. - [Harry] I'm not supposed to do that. - [Dan] Just give us the key. (suspenseful music) (body thudding on stairs) - (stammering) I'm sick. - Don't try to move, don't move. - The bottle, where's the bottle? - The bottle. Where's the bottle? (tense music) - Hey, what is this? - That's it. - You're a lucky man. - Looks like you're up against a brain this time. Here, take a look at this cap. What do you find? - I don't find anything. - Look inside. - Small hole, right? - Here's what you do. You very carefully loosen the excise stamp, peel it back, take a hypodermic needle, insert it through the cap thus. Now you've got Scotch and Escadine. A heated blade will smooth the plastic and hide the point of entry. You stick the stamp back down and send it to your worst enemy. Unless he looks inside the cap, he never suspects a thing. - Pretty clever. - Well, the Borgias never did better. - No prints? - Well, the only prints were made by Gurney and Cahill and that janitor. They weren't the real target, were they? - No, they weren't, Spence. It's meant for a doctor. How tough is it to get Escadine? - Well, put it this way, it wouldn't be an overwhelming problem if you work in a hospital. (dramatic music) - Why a doctor, why not a nurse? I mean, what are they, nuns, are they priests? They're human, they hate, they kill just like anybody else. - Like patients. - Yes, like patients. - Like Donald Esseltine. - Well, it's possible. He had a motive. After all, I had to remove his hand. He accused me of rushing it, of making a mistake. Is that why you brought him up? Do you have some-- - He claims he sent you a gift from Mickelberry's. A butcher knife. Now, we're checking with Mickelberry's. If what he claims is the truth, Doctor, he'll be in the clear. - If what he claims is true, then I'm afraid you've got yourself quite a problem. I'm not a popular man. I've been led to believe there won't be too many mourners at my funeral. - I don't understand. - You don't understand what? - Yesterday you told me you didn't have an enemy in the world. - Call it shock. No man likes to think somebody hates him enough to want to kill him. - What are you talking about? There isn't anyone in this town that doesn't respect you. Doctor, when are you gonna start leveling with me? How am I supposed to help you if you don't? - Lieutenant, I have become a successful man. I have become a demanding man. Nobody likes to have demands made on them. People resent success. - Well, then you're gonna need protection because he'll try it again. - No, I don't want protection. I don't want a lot of policemen following me around. I assure you I can take perfectly good care of myself. - Doctor-- - Now, Lieutenant if you'll forgive me, I have to prepare for a meeting of the disciplinary board. Good day. - What's happened to you in the last 24 hours? Why is it all of a sudden you don't care about living? - Good day, Lieutenant. (dramatic music) - Dan. This is Miss Crelic, one of the nurses here. - Hello. - Miss Crelic, would you tell Lieutenant August what you told me, please? - Well, yesterday I was working on this floor and I saw Dr. Rodell go into Dr. Serling's office. I figured there had to be fireworks, so I ducked out. - Why fireworks? - Those two didn't get along. Everybody in the hospital knew they were heading for a showdown. - Dr. Rodell is a resident here. - Yeah, I know, I met him last night. What's the trouble? - I'd rather not get into the middle of anything. You'd better ask the hospital director. - Word couldn't have leaked out already. I haven't even had time to prepare a formal statement. - Well, you can be informal with me. What will the statement say? - That the hospital board will vote to terminate Dr. Rodell's contract here. - Can you tell me why? - When we brought him here, we thought Dr. Rodell was a very promising young surgeon. Unfortunately, he hasn't worked out as well as we'd hoped. He's been difficult. And last month he prescribed medication for a patient contrary to the instructions of the doctor in charge. - You mean Dr. Serling? - Yes. - Is Dr. Serling responsible for Dr. Rodell being fired? - Most young doctors would have admitted their mistake and accepted the reprimand silently. Rodell's attitude was aggressive, belligerent, I considered it bordering on the psychotic. When I suggested psychiatric counseling, he just laughed at me. (tense music) (loud slapping) - I told you just to stay off my back. He's ruined my career. He's gonna pay for it. - Frank, don't be a fool. Don't make it any worse than it already is. (tense music) (doorbell chimes) Frank! - Hello. We're from the police department. I'm Lieutenant August, this is Sergeant Wilentz. Mind if we come in a minute? - Um. Is Dr. Rodell here? - No, he just left. What do you want? - Are you Mrs. Rodell? - No, I'm not, I'm his fiancee, Sharon Cooper. - Where'd he go? Where did he go, Miss Cooper? - I don't know, I... What do you want with him? - Tell us about this package from Mickelberry's. - I've never seen it before. - It's already been opened. Just show us what's inside. - Look for yourself. - We'd rather you did it. - It's just a knife. - Esseltine's gift. Rodell must have taken it out of the office. - Switched tags. - We'll have to take this along as evidence. - Evidence? Evidence for what? - Now, where did he go? - (quietly) Don't know. - A man's life may be in danger. Now, where did he go? - He went looking for Serling. - I'll call Serling at the hospital and warn him. (suspenseful music) (doorbell chimes) - All right, where is he? Where is he? Serling! Come on out, you dirty yellow... Serling! - Who are you? What do you want? - Where's your husband? Oh, look, don't lie to me 'cause I know he left the hospital at lunchtime for his afternoon off. - You're Dr. Rodell. Aren't you the man my husband had fired? Well, you're in no condition to talk to anyone. - I'm in no condition to waste time. Now. You're gonna tell me where your husband is. (suspenseful music) (tires screeching) - Are you all right? He didn't hurt you, did he? - Oh, no. He, uh, there was a time when I thought he might, but I managed to calm him down. - Why didn't you call us the minute he left? - Well, I didn't really think there was any danger. I mean, if I had I certainly wouldn't have told him where my husband was. - You told him? - I thought maybe if they sat down together they could work it out. - Where did you tell him your husband was? - He spends every Thursday afternoon on his boat. It's called the Rosalind II. (upbeat funk music) (siren blaring) (upbeat funk music) (splashing) (punch landing) - What about Serling? - Rodell chopped up the bottom. The hold's full of water. If Serling's down there, we're too late. - Come on, Rodell. Now, what'd you do with the body? - If I killed him, do you think I'd tell you? - Well, from what we hear about you, you're the type who might boast about it. - Yeah, I'm psychotic. (laughs) - I'd say that's a pretty good diagnosis. Somebody that goes around chopping holes in a boat, that's a little nuts, isn't it? - All right, I hate him! But I had every right to, he ruined my career. But I don't know where he is. I didn't kill him. - Now, let me get this story straight. You're upset because the poison didn't work, got a little impatient, went down to the boat. - Poison? What are you talking about poison? - We got a witness who saw you sneak into Serling's office, substitute a bottle of poisoned whiskey for one of the birthday presents. (Rodell sighs) - (laughs) Oh, yeah, now who's psychotic, huh? It's you. You don't even make sense. What poisoned whiskey, huh? What presents? - [Dan] That present. - All right, I did take this home. But I don't know anything about any poisoned whiskey. - Rodell, two old winos drank that whiskey and now they're dead. Now, that makes murder, doesn't it? - I didn't kill anybody! All right, all right. All right, I did go into Serling's office. Well, I didn't think anybody saw me. Well, I thought it didn't make any difference. - Why? Why'd you go in the office? - Well, I was looking for something. See, there's a rumor around the hospital that Serling has a mistress. And I thought that if I could find proof, I could get him to withdraw charges against me. - You didn't find anything, though, did you? - Yeah, I found something. Check stubs. He's been paying rent on this apartment at the Mountain View for four months now. - Where are these stubs now? - In my apartment. - This was in your apartment, too. - Well, I can explain that. Well, you see, when I went into Serling's office, somebody else came in there. - You mean somebody else came in and switched the packages? - Yeah. - Who? Now, if you're telling the truth somebody else is gonna take the rap for the death of two winos. Now, don't be cute. - All right. You're not gonna believe this, but it's the living truth. The person I saw switch those packages was Dr. Michael Serling. (dramatic music) - You're right, we don't believe it. - It's the truth! - Dr. Serling planted a bottle of poisoned whiskey on himself? - Who said he was gonna drink it? He's got a wife and a mistress, hasn't he? That's one woman too many. - It's really a terrific story, Rodell. But it still doesn't explain this knife in your apartment. - When Serling left his office, I saw him throw this in the trash bin. I took it home just to see what he was throwing away. - Book him. - Excuse me a minute, Father. - George, what'd you drag us down here for? Couldn't it wait? - No, it couldn't wait. Morning report says you found the check stubs in Rodell's apartment and they back up his story. - That's right, so? - So, why don't you arrest Dr. Serling for murder? - Because we don't buy Rodell's story. - Those check stubs don't prove a thing, Chief. Rodell could have gotten them any place, any time. - For all we know, George, Dr. Michael Serling could be lying dead somewhere right now. - [Joe] Car Eleven to Car Nine, come in. - August. - Dan, there's still no sign of Serling, but the check stubs to the Mountain View paid for an apartment for a girl named Linda Perry. She moved in four months ago, right after her stay in the hospital. - The hospital? - That's right. She was brought in because she tried to commit suicide by cutting her wrists. That was a week before the apartment was taken for her. The doctor that sewed her up was Serling. (dramatic music) - Yeah, I know I called 20 minutes ago, operator, but this is urgent. I've got to get through to Zurich. Look, if the circuits are busy can you go through Rome? Yes, I will pay the difference, operator. Yes, I'll wait. - Would you like another drink, Michael? - (sighs) No, thanks, Linda. Doesn't seem to be helping very much. - How about some coffee? - Oh, no thanks, nothing. Hans, is that you? It's Michael. I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. Hans, listen, I made the arrangements. The plane arrives in Zurich 8 p.m. your time tomorrow. Can you be there? (doorbell chimes) (suspenseful music) - Miss Linda Perry? - Yes. - I'm from the police department. I'm Lieutenant August. Can I talk to you a minute? - Oh, uh, I'm sorry, I can't talk now. I'm not feeling very well and I was about to rest. - This won't take long. You're a friend of Dr. Michael Serling's, aren't you? - Why? - Well, we're afraid something might have happened to him. - Oh, no, I... He's perfectly all right, I can assure you. I just spoke to him a few minutes ago. He's on his way home. - Do you mind if I use your phone a minute? - There's a phone downstairs. I told you, I'm not feeling well. - That's right. - Now, wait a minute! Don't go in there! You have no right to do this. - If Dr. Serling's in that bedroom, I do. - Dan. May I ask what you're doing here? - I was just about to ask you the same thing, Doctor. - Miss Perry's a patient and a friend. And I assure you, Lieutenant, she can't help you find the man who's trying to murder me. - I'm not so sure anybody is trying to murder you now, Doctor. Just how long have you and Miss Perry had this, uh, relationship? - This what? - What are you trying to say? - Four months ago, Miss Perry tried to kill herself. You don't suppose that the reason she did that was because the man that was responsible for making her pregnant is married, do you? - Dan, I swear to you that's not true. - Why don't you tell me what is true? When are you gonna stop holding out on me? When are you gonna stop lying? - I suggest you tell me plainly just exactly what you mean. - What's your favorite drink, Doctor? Royal Inverness scotch, isn't it? Or is that your wife's? - Are you suggesting that I would want to do away with my wife? - That's exactly what I'm suggesting. - Oh, my God. - I hope you have proof. - I have an eyewitness that saw you take a poisoned bottle of scotch into your office and switch tags with Esseltine's present. - That's not true. - You were gonna take that scotch home. Leona'd take a drink of it and we'd arrest him for murder. - You'll never prove that. - I'll try, Doctor. I'll try. Come on. (dramatic music) - Arresting a man like Serling on such evidence, if I can dignify it by calling it evidence, is grabbing at straws. - Take it easy, now, Ben. Why don't you look at it from our viewpoint? The man's got a motive, he's got a wife, and he's got a mistress. - The girl's a patient until proven otherwise. - And she tried to commit suicide because she was pregnant. Now, his wife won't give him a divorce and even if she did give him a divorce, it would wreck him professionally. - Speculation. - Ben, those two dead winos, that's not speculation. - The only testimony against Serling is tainted by prejudice. Why, no district attorney in his right mind would even put Rodell on the stand. That's why I insisted that he be released. I'm sorry, but I had no other alternative under the law. - Now, you bear this in mind, one thing hasn't changed. He still has a wife and he still wants to get rid of her. - Even if you're right, Dan, I doubt if he'll try it again now. - The man is psychotic enough to try to murder his wife once, he'll try to murder her again. Maybe not in the same way, Ben, but he'll try to murder her again. Next time how do you suggest I stop him? (dramatic music) (knocking) - Yes? - Good morning. I'm Sergeant Rivera. I'd like to see Mrs. Serling, please. - She's not here. - Uh, just a second. When will she be back? - I don't know. I'm sorry, I just don't have that information. You'll have to see Dr. Serling about it and he's at the hospital. - Why does she need a nurse? Is she sick? - I'm not at liberty to give out any information, you'll have to talk to Dr. Serling. (dramatic music) - Car Nine, Car Nine, come in, Dan. - [Dan] Yeah, Joe. - Dan, something's up. I think we may have been too late to warn her. - I'm sorry. I can't perform the Watson operation. You'll have to get somebody else to do it. - I don't understand you. That operation is scheduled 30 minutes from now. - You'll have to get somebody else to do it. - Michael! I'm entitled to an explanation. What's the matter with you? This morning you were too tied up on the phone to make your rounds, you've been tense-- - And I'm doing the patient a favor by not operating. I suggest you stop wasting time and call my standby, Dr. Holbrook. (tense music) - Good morning, Doctor. I've been looking for you. - Really, what now? - I sent one of my men over to get some information from your wife. All they got was a lot of double talk from a nurse. - My wife's nerves have been bad for some time. I hired a companion for her. She did just what she is being paid to do. - Where is your wife, Doctor? - At home. - The nurse says she isn't. - Well, if Mrs. Haskins said that it was to protect my wife. Now, if you'll forgive me, August, I'm scheduled for surgery. - Doctor. Do I have permission to interview your wife? - You do not. - Then can I see her if I don't talk to her? - What, you afraid she's already dead, Lieutenant? - Can I see her? - You may not see her. - Then I'll get a warrant and search your house. (dramatic music) - Dan, you said yourself that he wouldn't try it again so soon. So what's so urgent? Unless he was totally insane. - I wouldn't rule that out, George. There's been a lot of changes in the man. - Based on the evidence, I don't think you could get a judge to sign a search warrant. - That's why I want you to do it. - Well, I'll try Judge Mattias. What'll I say you're searching for? - A dead body. (dramatic music) - Looks like there's nobody here. - Yeah. (funky jazz music) (knocking) She's on the phone. We're from the police department, we have a search warrant. We're checking for evidence of homicide. - Homicide? Search? I don't know about any of this. I'm going to have to speak to-- - No phone calls, Mrs. Haskins. - You guys check the back. Ben. - I'll take the upstairs, Charlie. - All right. (suspenseful music) - What do you got? - Found these hidden in the back of a closet. Pretty heavy. - Let's open them up. (suspenseful music) What do you got? - Clothes. What have you got? - Clothes. Somebody's making a phone call. Where's the nurse? - In the kitchen, making coffee. - Yes, sir. She just called. She's at the marina. The Freemonts' boat. Thank you, I'm glad I did the right thing. I wasn't sure. All right. I called the doctor. He's entitled to know that strangers are ransacking his home. - What'd he tell you to do? - Nothing. Go ahead and search, you won't find anything. - Why? He get rid of the body? - What body? What are you talking about? - His wife, she's dead, isn't she? - No. - He killed her, he disposed of the body. - Are you insane? There's nothing wrong with Mrs. Serling. Why, just a little while ago she phoned. You were at the front door. - Phoned from where? - I don't know, she didn't say. She left early this morning without warning. - Without her luggage? - Yes, that's what she phoned for. She asked me to take her clothes to her. - Take them where? Mrs. Haskins, we're investigating a murder here. Now, take 'em where? - The marina. She's hiding on a friend's boat. The Freemonts. - Hiding from what? - The doctor. - The doctor? The doctor hired you, didn't he? - (quietly) Yes. - Well, then she knows if she calls that you'll call him. Now, why would she do that? - I don't know why, but she did and that's the truth. - Just now on the phone, did you tell the doctor where she was? - Yes. - Let's go, Charlie. (dramatic music) (gun fires) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (gun fires) (suspenseful music) - Oh! - All right, Charlie. - It's you! I thought it was my husband. He's trying to kill me. I swear, I thought it was my husband. - Sure you did. - He's tried it before, too. I knew that I'd never be safe at the house anymore, so I came out here to hide, but he's followed me here, he wants me dead. - No, Mrs. Serling, he doesn't want you-- (car door slams) - Keep him away from me! - You're gonna be all right, Mrs. Serling. You're gonna be perfectly safe. - You don't believe me! There is another woman. She's carrying his child. Admit it, Michael. You're paying her rent for her. You love her. - Leona, Leona, I never loved her. She's a patient who needed a friend. - Oh, lies. He was going to leave me. And he wanted to marry her. But when I told him I'd never give him a divorce, he was going to have me put away. - Is that what you've been trying to do all this time? Protect her? - I had no choice. - That's why you decided not to cooperate with us. - Well, what else could I do? She's my wife. I couldn't let her be arrested. I couldn't let her be locked away in a mental institution. I made arrangements for her to enter a private sanitarium in Switzerland. She would have been treated by the finest psychiatrist I know, Dr. Hans Loder. - (scoffs) Don't listen to him, he's lying. He's a terrible person. He's always plotting against me. He tries to hide it, but I can see through him. So, you were going to have me locked up, were you, Michael? It's a wicked thing to lock anybody up. But it wasn't really necessary. Lieutenant, it isn't necessary at all. - Mrs. Serling, two men are dead because of you. Don't you understand that? - That was all a mistake. I never meant for it to work out that way at all. You can't blame me for a mistake. Can you? (tense music) - Come on. - Dan, I understand how upset you are about the Serling case, but I'm afraid you have a long night ahead. About 11:20 we received a call that a woman's body was found in a ditch. No, the caller hung up without giving his name. That's right. Charlie is checking the location now. Thanks, Dan. - Mike. - Dan. Charlie. - Hi, Mike. - What do you got? - Female Caucasian, 20, 25 years old. Appears to be a fracture of the occipital bone near the right ear. There's also a bruise on the left side of the jaw. - Which came first? - Well, I might want to change later, but right now I'd say she got hit in the jaw and struck the back of her head against something hard. Didn't have to be too hard, either. She's got a very thin skull. Average woman would have survived it. - Anything else, Mike? - She was raped. And murdered. (dramatic music) She put up a pretty good fight, Dan. Skin under the fingernails. When you find the man, he'll be marked. - [Man] Lieutenant August? - Hello, Henley. - I think I recognize her, sir. - Who is she? - Sherry Lazar when I knew her. Later she was married to a fellow named Stan Manders. (doorbell chimes) (funky music playing) - Come in. Who are you guys? - Your name Stan Manders? Can you turn that radio down? - Is that all that's wrong, the radio's too loud? (clicks off radio) - Is your name Stan Manders? - Yeah. - Is your wife at home? - No. (can clatters) - You know where she is? - No. - You don't seem very interested, Mr. Manders. Police come to your house at midnight, ask about your wife, you don't even wanna know why. - She doesn't live here anymore. I haven't seen her for two months. Now, why should I care? - Can you tell us who she's staying with? - Staying with her old man the last I heard. If she's not there, I don't know where she is. - What's his name and phone number? - Dominic Lazar, 555-4720. (rotary dialing) - Dominic Lazar? This is Sergeant Wilentz of the police. Can you tell me where your daughter went this evening? I see. Well, I can't really discuss it over the phone. Could you meet us at police headquarters, say in 45 minutes? Fine, thank you. - What's all this about? - We have reason to believe that your wife is dead. - (quietly) Dead? - Murdered. - He said she had a date at the Roundup Cafe and he doesn't know with who. I'll check into it. (dramatic music) - Joe. - Hi, Dan. - Anything come in from the murder site? - No, nothing so far. The attack took place somewhere else and the body was dumped there. Uh, did you get a positive identification? - Sherry Manders. - Stanley? What happened to Sherry? - She's dead. - Well, how did she get that way, Stanley? Did you kill her? - Don't be ridiculous, Dominic. - Hey, hey! - Talk to me, Stanley! - Alright! - I wanna hear you say you didn't kill her. - Knock it off! - You better tell me the truth, I'll break your neck! - Come on. - Come over here. - Just tell me one thing, did he kill her? - She was raped, Mr. Lazar. Now, why would her own husband attack her? - Because that's the way he is, like an animal. Even when they were married, he wouldn't take no for an answer, he'd beat her. That's why she came back home to live because she couldn't take it. Maybe he done it again. - She have any other boyfriends? - No, no boyfriends. She never played around. May I sit down? - Sure. You say she didn't have any boyfriends. She had a date tonight, didn't she? - Well, it's her first time since she left Stanley. I don't know who it was. All she'd tell me was, "Don't wait up. "Pop, I'm going to the Roundup." I told her, "You're a grown woman, you've been married. "Why should I wait up?" I waited up. - No scratches? - No scratches. - What's his story? - Well, he claims he went to every beer joint in town last night, trouble is he doesn't remember which place at which time. - All right, turn him loose, but he stays on the list. - List, what list? Who else do you have? - Sherry's date tonight. That gives us two suspects. - Or two victims. Maybe her date's lying out there someplace, too. - I used to give her a lift home the nights we stayed open. Tuesdays and Fridays. Tonight she didn't need a ride. - [Charlie] Why not? - She had a date. Lieutenant, I want to know why she was murdered. Had she been criminally attacked? - Yes. - Brutal. Ugly. What makes men do such things? If I'd only stepped in. I knew in my heart those boys were up to no good, but when she went along with them, willingly enough, or so it seemed, I persuaded myself it was all right. - What boys are you talking about? - Well, there were three, no four. Two of them held the door and tried to coax her in and the other one stood by and there was the driver, that makes four. - Is it possible that one of those boys was the man she had a date with tonight? - Troy Stedman? No, he was only 17. Much, much too young for a woman like Sherry. - Troy Stedman? - Since Sherry came to work for us, he's been our steadiest customer. Although, all he ever read was paperbacks. - Mr. Prescott, could you positively identify Troy Stedman as one of the boys in the car? - No, it was dark, it was some distance away, I... My eyes aren't that keen. - Well, what about the car? You must have seen the car. What about the color or the license plate, something like that? - No, I'm afraid not. I only knew Sherry a month. Yet, somehow I felt I've always known her. Since I'm a coward, Sherry is dead. - Mr. Prescott, there were four of them. You were badly outnumbered. - So was poor Sherry. (jazzy music) - Joe, run a check on a 17 year old kid named Troy Stedman. If he doesn't have a record, I'll settle for an address. - [Joe] Right away. Oh, Dan, I checked out the Roundup Cafe. - Did you have any luck? - [Joe] Well, they had a recording artist as a guest star. The place was really crowded. I checked out every one of the staff and nobody remembered seeing her. - All right, thanks, Joe. (gentle jazz music) - Come on in here, gentlemen. Look, that party out there is for my anniversary. What's so important it couldn't wait until morning? - We'd like to talk to your son, Mr. Stedman. - Troy? He's not here. - He's not home either. - I know that. - You know where he is? - I do. Now, I'd like to know what you're investigating and why you think Troy is involved. - A young woman was raped and murdered and your son knew her. - He what? - He knew her. We have reason to believe that he was in a car that picked her up. - What are you trying to say, Lieutenant? Troy doesn't even have a car. He left by... What time was this woman murdered? - Somewhere around 11 p.m. - My son returned to Kierney Military Academy for the fall term. That's up near San Torino. To get there by check-in time, he had to take the 7:30 bus. - Did he make the bus? - I have no reason to doubt it. - Would you mind calling and finding out? - Not at all. (rotary dialing) - Yes, the boy's with me now, Mr. Stedman. The duty officer states that Cadet Stedman reported in tonight on schedule. - He's been there since nine o'clock. - Would you care to speak to him yourself? - Yes, please. - It's your father Stedman. - Dad? What is it, what's wrong? - Just a moment, son. - This is Lieutenant August. (dramatic music) - She's been... Oh, my God. No, sir. No. Sir, I think I'm going to be sick. - Dismissed. (dramatic music) Mr. Stedman. What? Oh, oh, I see. Well, Lieutenant, would you mind telling me what this is all about? (suspenseful music) (rotary dialing) (telephone ringing) (man sighs) - Hello? What? Oh, who is this? Oh, Troy. It's 2 a.m. You're lucky my folks aren't in. She's... Hey, man, are you putting me on? - Griff, my old man just called me. The cops were there. They found Sherry dead by the highway. She was murdered! - Hey, man, cool it, will you? Look, we left you off then we dropped her off at the Roundup. Sure, she was okay then. Whatever happened, it happened after that. Yeah, sure, it's too bad, but I had nothing to do with it. I swear, Troy, I had nothing to do with it. Yeah, I'll speak to you later. (dramatic music) - Looked into this matter. There is no doubt, there's no doubt whatsoever, that Stedman was in this school from nine o'clock last night until this moment. - The victim was last seen at 8:30 p.m. - Sir, I caught the bus at 7:30, arrived here at nine. - The bus driver doesn't remember seeing you on the bus. - Well, it was crowded. I guess that's why. Here's my ticket stub. - Are you satisfied, Lieutenant? - Not quite. Do you mind taking off your shirt, Mr. Stedman? - May I remind you this is not Santa Luisa? This is not even the same county. You have no authority here. The point I'm making, Stedman, is that if you do this, you do this voluntarily. - Yes, sir. - Turn around, please. Thank you. You liked Sherry, didn't you? - Yes, sir. I bought some books from her and talked to her a while. But... She was nice. - She have many friends? - I don't know who else knew her. Maybe somebody from out of town did it. - I don't think so. I mean, she got in the car voluntarily. She'd have to know the people in the car to do that, wouldn't she? - Then, sir, I guess she knew them all right. - Did you know them? Did you know them, Stedman? May I have a pencil and a paper, please? Thank you. (tense music) Stedman, I want you to give me a list of all your close friends in Santa Luisa. (tense music) - All right, we've got 26 names here. Maybe the guilty four aren't on here. - That boy knows who they are, George. He's looking for a way to tell me and I gave him one. (intercom buzzes) - Yeah. - [Woman] There's a call for Dan. A Mr. Dominic Lazar. (dramatic music) - Mr. Lazar. - I just finished making the funeral arrangements for my daughter. I don't suppose you know who killed her yet, do you? - No, not yet. Is that why you called us? - I do. Four boys. They dragged her into their car and they drove her someplace and afterwards they killed her so that nobody would know who did it. Well, I found out who one of them is. - Where'd you get your information, Mr. Lazar? - A clerk at the Book Corner. Harriet somebody, I forget what her last name is. She said she saw these boys drive off with Sherry. She said one of them is Troy Stedman. - Mr. Lazar, we know about the four boys. - Now you know who one of them is! Arrest this Troy Stedman. - We know about Stedman. He's been cleared. - Cleared? What is this, cleared? He was there, he helped to do this to Sherry. - Mr. Lazar. The boy has an alibi. - Alibi! - He was in school at the time the attack took place. - That's a lie. He's lying. What kinda cops are you, you can't see that? Well, I'll tell you! These are rich boys from rich families, they don't care about the law. That's what's wrong with this country. There's two kinds of law, one for them, one for us. I'll tell you something else, they're gonna pay! - All right, Mr. Lazar. - These boys murdered my daughter. You're not gonna do my job, I'll see to it that they pay! I'm gonna find that convertible! They'll pay. - What convertible? - The one she told me about, the one they drove! - You say they got into a convertible? - Yes. I only had a glimpse. - Excuse me, Lieutenant, has there been any... Have you found out who did it? - We're making some progress, yes. - You'll have made progress when he's in the gas chamber. - He was crazy about her. - Did Sherry know it? - Good heavens, no. He didn't think anybody knows. He sneaks around so. I happen to know he goes to nudie movies. (whimsical music) - Is that right? Mm. - Mm. - I checked Troy's list of names for cars. - Any convertibles? - Three. One white one, one been in a repair shop for a while. - What about the other one? - Strong possibility. Belongs to a family named Whitaker on Mariposa Drive. - We'll have the lab check it out. Any boys in the family? - One, name is Griff, short for Griffin. (swinging jazz music) - Woo! (splashing) (kids chattering) - Griff! Griff! These two. Griff! (kids exclaiming) (splashing) - Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Cheap shot, gang! What is this? - You deserved it! Don't be such a drag, come on in! - I can't, I told you, doctor's orders. - [Boy] Oh, yeah. - Hey, look, I oughta be home in bed. - Yeah! - Oh, we know! - Look, I got asthma. - Look, if you can't come in, change the music. - [Boy] Yeah. - Sure. (kids chattering) (music ends) (loud rock music playing) (splashing) (kids exclaiming) - [Boy] Hey, there's something wrong with him! Griff's bleeding! Griff, hey! (dramatic music) - We were all in the water at this end of the pool. Brenda and Griff were here on the couch. Kim asked Griff if he'd change the records on the stereo. - Show us exactly what he did. - Well... He uh, he walked around. He walked around about this far. Then he walked over to the stereo to about here. It was about here, wasn't it? - It was at the end of the table, Ronny. - About to here. Then he just reeled around like a drunk. We just thought he was clowning. - Take it easy, son. Rivera's lining up the angle. The stereo drowned out the sound of the gunfire. The bullet caught him and spun him around right into the pool. He was probably dead before he hit the water. - Any marks on the body? - Yeah, his chest was all scratched up, just like Doc said. - Find out where Dominic Lazar was tonight. - Yeah. - And Charlie. - Yeah? - Do the same for Stan Manders, huh? - All right. - What's up there? - Well, the property backs up to a low hill. Halfway up you got a clean shot at anybody here on the patio. - Rifle, huh? - Had to be. - How did he know which one? How did he know? - Which friend have you come to see? - I was told that Dominic Lazar was here. - Oh, yes. Mrs. Manders in Slumber Room Four. - I'm not a mourner. Would you ask Mr. Lazar to step out, please? Police business. - Excuse me, Mr. Lazar, there's someone to see you. - What do you want here? - Sorry, Mr. Lazar. Can we go someplace? - Why? - I'd like to talk to you. You, too. - No. Nobody leaves Sherry. You want to say something, you say it right here. - All right. Where were you earlier this evening? Say between eight and nine p.m. - Here, right here. - Anybody with you? - Only one person. You wanna talk to her? - Manders, where were you? - I was at home asleep. - At eight o'clock? - I slept for four hours and then I came back to relieve Dominic. - [Dominic] She's never gonna be alone. Now, why do you ask all these questions? - A boy was shot dead tonight. - A boy? What boy? One of the ones that killed Sherry? Okay, so he got what he deserved. - Even if he was guilty, he deserved a fair trial. - Yeah, when they turn him loose I know what the judge would say. Just a young kid that made a little mistake. Send him home, don't give him any spending money for a month. - They're not sending this boy home, Mr. Lazar. - Uh-huh. What do you want from me? Tears? I already spilled 'em all for my own kid. - I want an alibi. - Alibi, don't give me alibi. Alibis are for rich people who can pay people to lie for them. I got no alibi, so maybe you'd better arrest me, put me in a cell, and tell everybody that Dominic Lazar is a murderer. But you're still gonna have to prove it, you see? You're gonna have to prove that. - That's right. I'm gonna have to prove it. - I'm on until midnight. - I'll be in touch. - I didn't even know her. Just what I read in the papers, that's all, about her being found dead. Well, that's all I know about her. - If I may say so, Lieutenant, I think you have a very fragile connection here. My son was a friend of Griff Whitaker, who may or may not have been involved with this Manders woman. - Griff Whitaker borrowed his father's car that night. - And so? - So we can prove that that car was involved in the murder of Sherry Manders. - I wasn't with him. I was over at Kevin's house, Mom, we were talking about school starting. As far as I know, I've never seen her. - Well, then you have nothing to be afraid of, do you? - No. - Good. Now, will you give us your friend's full name and address, please? - Kevin Colter. 426 Laughton Place. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Lieutenant, I hope this will be the end of it. - So do I. If I were you I'd have your son stay close to the house. Thank you. - I'm not even dressed yet. - Listen, you jerk, the cops are on their way over to your house. Look, just get out of there and don't let anybody see you, okay? Okay. Okay, soon as I can make it. - I know he was here less than an hour ago because I called him to the phone. He must have left for school early. - Thank you. - Six to one the phone call was from a young man. - Yeah, let's cruise around the neighborhood, see what we can find out. - Right. (dramatic music) (gun fires) Rifle shot! (suspenseful music) Ronny's dead, too. - Our killer does it all. Investigates, convicts and executes. - Three homicides in less than a week. How many more before we put a stop to this? All right. We don't know the name of the fourth boy in the car. How is it the killer knows so much? - When we catch him, George-- - What about the girl's father? - The girl's father would have used his hands instead of a gun. - All right, her husband, then. - Sherry left him two or three months ago. Why would he want revenge? - Gentlemen, we have a killer loose in this town and the way everybody's talking around here we don't even have a suspect! - I got one. What about Prescott? We know he was hung up on her. - I got another one for you. Sherry Manders' date that night at the Roundup. - Yeah, all right, that'll be all. Dan. We've got four suspects and two kids to protect. Make it happen. - Joe. - Yes? - We have to find out the identity of Sherry Manders' date the night she was murdered and I want to know the name of the fourth boy in the car. - You just want a miracle, right? - Right. - Okay. - Charlie, put a guard on that Colter kid until I tell you not to. - Dan, if the Colter's accept protection for their kid, isn't that an admission that he was involved in Sherry's death? - My son doesn't need police protection. I've taken charge of that myself. - We'll have a unit looking out for him anyway. - Well, they'll be guarding an empty stable. - Where is he, Mr. Colter? - I'm not going to tell you. You've done enough damage already just by showing up to question my son, you've told this maniac who his next victim should be. - This maniac doesn't need any help from us. He knows. - It won't do him any good. I'm putting Kevin out of reach. - You mean you're getting him out of the country, is that right? - I'm doing what's necessary. And if it bends any laws, we've got a good defense. The Santa Luisa Police have proven themselves incompetent to protect people. (motor revs) (jazzy music) - This is Car Nine. Tell Charlie to put an APB out on Kevin Colter. Check the planes going out of Los Angeles and San Francisco. (tense music) - Lieutenant August? I'm Inspector Tompkins, San Francisco Police Department. That boy you're looking for just came through. - Hold it. (suspenseful music) - It was an accident, you know. I mean her getting hurt like that. - There was no accident. Somebody hit her. - Yeah, it was Griff. He got mad and, and he hit her. - Why don't you just start at the beginning now? - She was on her way to the Roundup to meet a date. We gave her a lift there. I mean, we were just, just for kicks, we... We didn't mean anything. At least I didn't. Maybe Griff had something in mind, I don't know. He didn't stop at the Roundup, he just barreled on past. - Why don't you just give us the name, son. - Griff, Ronny, and me. - What about the other one? We got two witnesses who saw Sherry get in the car with four boys. - Oh, yeah. When we picked her up at the Book Corner, Troy was with us. He was on his way back to boarding school and Griff said we'd drive him there, it was faster than the bus. - Then it happened on the way back? - After we left Troy, obviously. She was mad about being late for her date. Ronny and I tried to kid her out of it. I mean, we were just fooling around. Maybe Ronny got a little too grabby. Anyway, she slapped him and that made Griff sore. He stopped the car and told me to drive, said he'd cool her out and then she jumped out of the car and tried to run and, well, Griff drug her back and she scratched him up pretty bad. - Is that when he hit her? - Well, he knocked her down. She seemed kinda, you know, dazed. I was driving, I really didn't see what Griff and Ronny were doing to her back there. - You know what happened back there. You know what happened back there, don't you? Get in the car. (Kevin crying) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We got her back to town and she was out cold. We were really scared. I wanted to call an ambulance, but Griff wouldn't let me. He said we'd dump her someplace and we'd all swear we'd never seen her. (crying) Then it'd just be her word against the three of us. - Yeah. Except she didn't live to talk about it, did she? - (shuddering) No, sir. (crying) - Did you talk to Troy about it? - No. No. He called Griff when he found out. I guess he was real uptight. (dramatic music) (rotary dialing) - Hello, this is, well you know. That's right. Look, the cops just got here from Santa Luisa. They must know something to be coming back so soon. Look, I can't hold out any longer. If they ask me I'll have to tell them. You better make a run for it. I'll hold out as long as I can. Sir, I don't know what you want me to tell you. - I want you to start telling me the truth for a change! - [Troy] I've never told you anything but the truth. - No, all you've done is left a few things out. A few things like who the guilty boys were. - They were my friends, sir. - That's very noble, Stedman. You shot your mouth off to somebody and that somebody killed two boys, now isn't that enough for you? - Well, I didn't know he was gonna do anything like-- - (shouting) Well, what'd you think he was gonna do, hand out medals? - Anyway, I had to tell him. (shudders) - You had to tell who? - Stan Manders. I mean, he threatened to shoot me. And I hadn't done anything. They did it. They deserved to be punished for what they did. They had no right to do that. Did they? Did they? (dramatic music) (intercom buzzes) - Katy speaking. Yeah. Joe. On three. - Rivera. Yeah, Dan. - Arrest Stan Manders for murder. And Joe, be careful, he's armed. (dramatic music) - [Joe] Car Nine. - August. - [Joe] Dan, we've checked everywhere. So far we're unable to locate Manders. - Well, keep checking. (suspenseful music) (rifle fires) (rifle fires) He's on the roof. - Never a cop around when you need one. - Cover me. (thrilling music) (gun firing) (rifle firing) (gun fires) (rifle firing) (thrilling music) (guns firing) (thudding down stairs) - [Charlie] Now, lie still. You'll be all right. - I got two of 'em. I wanted to get the other one. - Manders, why? - They killed my wife. - But she'd left you. - She was coming back. That night she was gonna meet me at the Roundup. She was coming home again. Dominic was right, nobody was gonna do anything, so it was up to me. She was... (dramatic music) - I'm sorry. I only told him because-- - Never mind. - I just want to try to make you understand. - Never mind. - But I loved her! - I wouldn't lean too heavily on that if I were you. - But I did. - So did Manders. (box thuds) - This is their stuff, I'm taking it back to my place. Those lousy kids. Everything would have been all right if they hadn't... They killed Stanley, too. I'm gonna take care of his funeral. 'Cause what he did, he did for me, too. - Dominic. He was no hero. He took the law into his own hands and now he's dead. And for what? Kevin'll be tried and convicted just like the others would have been. When are people like you gonna learn? - She was my daughter. - I know. And you loved her. But you go on hating like this, because of what was done to her, and even her memory is gonna go sour. (dramatic music) (funky jazz music)
