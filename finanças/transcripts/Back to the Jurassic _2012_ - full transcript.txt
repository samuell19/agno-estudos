I'm very familiar with my mother, he's always watching me. I have never tasted freedom. 31, 00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:17,179 Hello? -- Ernie if you have to store? -- Soon to enter. -- Okay, do the best you can do. -- Back in 15 minutes. Both Mom. "Back in 150 minutes." You heard him, he said as fast as I could. Ah ... National Museum of Terra Dino. The only places in the world. And that this is the Mystery Stone. You see the carvings? 've Been there since the time of the Cretaceous. Very strange, because who who will carve it? No man alive at 145 million years ago! Only dinosaurs. Is not it mysterious? Well, that's what we know in there. Restore. It is my best friend Max. He always had a way of make something cool. Which makes it look cool ... ... But sometimes, other children did not see it that way. Do you think Leonardo da Vinci never painted his own son? What? Pal? See, there are gorgeous. What? Where? Basic Suck! Hahaha ... -- Ernie, how to board the rocket? assessment 1 to 10 ... -- 37, a friend. Buuyaa!! You and your dad really make this amazing thing. Hey, talk about my father ... According to him, there are examples of new fossil which has been excavated in 2329. You'd better come on opening ceremony tomorrow. Fabulous! I've recorded it? I can not wait anymore. Wait ... But the show has not been opened. Are not you supposed to keep the store your mother? Friends ... You're like my mother who always tell me what to do this and that! Do you know, breaking the rules is wrong the best part of us as children. The most important thing to be parents are making the rules. Once the rules have been made ... ... The key is to make them obedient. Exactly as you wish. Doing all things as he wishes, and not what I want to do. It is a compromise. There is no compromise! This goal will be achieved if both all family members to participate. Of course, that does not mean we become abusive parents. Ready to begin. Mission Arrest Large--Magnitude! The beauty of this is when the ancient objects ... It is Gallimimus. He could run as far as 20 miles per hour. 25 miles per hour. You have to read more.! And it is the super--duper--saurus opinion. Well, we continue to another place. Sometimes kids think they knows better than in adults. -- They do not know more than adults "Just For The Stakeholder" -- We should not. -- But we have to. Stay alert! It seems fairly complicated. With the right algorithms and variable possible key combination can be found. What about the possibility of the door is not locked? Buuyaa!! Buuyaa .. What if they follow us? Tyrannosaurus! The most deadly predators. Attacked without mercy It's just a T--Rex statue, Max. Let's go. Always keep an eye on. That's our baby. If we get complacent a little while! Who knows chaos what will be done. Hey, Max look. He's definitely in there. Yeah, but this thing covered. pity. Let's get out of here. I'm not here just to infiltrate to see the giant cover! Let us remove the lid. -- I do not know Ernie ... -- I pull this section, you pull in there. Be careful! -- Hey, what are you doing? -- Infrared motion detectors. Wait! Watch this! Can I get into? Ernie, I'd love to be like before I was an adult! Cool! Now it's time. One, two, three! -- Very scary. -- 900. No offense to board a rocket! Not a problem. Sarcosuchus. I'm sure you do not want met him in the darkness. With teeth like that? I do not want to meet at any time. You can not lie again to me, Ernie. It's your 25 cents. You'd better call a lawyer! Secure location. Shut up the kids. I smell a spy in the museum. Let's go! Goodbye forever! Alright. Ratings of 1 to 10? Minus 50! You drive it without notice and do not know where to go. Calm Max. I've been very familiar with this place. I get it, I get it. You think you can? Do not believe you underestimate me, Max. I'm a little hurt! Exit on the left. I guess not. Thank you for this award. You back ... Now I introduce the ... "Boy--saurus is the problem." Well ... Could explain, technically I did not violate orders. Ernie ... You asked me to go to the store after school. And I've been there. There is proof. I leave a note. "Back in 150 minutes." You see, I'm not breaking orders. I just went to study at the museum. You know you've been violated. Plus, the damage at the museum. They announcement of their new pair robbed. I know Mom, I'm sorry. Deeds cause harm to others, you must learn to fix it. I should have been able to count on, another party and one day will be. I just wanted to see the skeleton. They are just fossils millions of years, they are not going to go anywhere. Okay, now I punish three weeks. This peraturanku Ernie, and there is no compromise! Go into your room, close the door until I call you for dinner. Hemh, Mother of the Year, Haa .. No one requesting choice. Can not you make your life interesting than just bugging me alone. Three weeks? It was a penalty toughest you've ever received. I would not be caught if the alarm is not turned on. And I know Max very thorough ... Tarraaa ... -- You! -- I'm what? You will receive a reply. Enjoy your week sentenced to three. This is not fair. It never ends. Ernie's time to go to the store. Ernie's time to practice violin. Time to clean up your room, Ernie. What about the time Ernie? When can I have my own rules. There is an open window beside me. At other times I would think twice. I can not. I do not want to. But I have to! Ernie, can not be trusted! Max, open the door. I came. There are still weaknesses in the door opener equipment my father. Think. Not your mother ... Your mother does not punish you? Stop it, stop it! Yeah, he's punishing me for three weeks. But you're here. -- What about your father? -- I had to help him after school a few months. Open up your mind. Friends, who else can. No, not Mrs. Ernie allow it to drink soda. Ernie Her mother is not here. Hehe ... Is getting bigger garage? True. We sell cars and made a study room. Father, Ernie is here. Here! Hey Dr. Santiago, how development of its Time Machine? Four years and still does not work. So long, I think its key not connected properly. Now I think the problem in the control panel. Look. Function relaynya functioning normally. Transfer mode location, function. I do not know. You must be the father. We certainly can. You know the robot vacuum? I'm sure, could probably use as a time machine so that power can be. Time in which I could make my own rules? Ratings of 1 to 10 ... -- You can not do it. -- No doubt. Sneaking out and drinking soda. Double trouble! Basic handyman stalker! Three weeks is not much. I will promise make in the law for three years. You guys be careful! These items belonged to my father, stop fighting. Give the phone. I do not do it! Sneaking out, drinking soda ... And damage the engine ... Dr. Santiago. Ernie, you got three problems! So this is my fault? I think not! You came and suddenly the fun ... ... Stop. Maybe there is construction work on the road. What is it? Max, do you have a dog that you never tell me? This is so weird. Well, do not have the touch I think the control panel is problematic. Julia, are you okay? -- Is he still there? -- Yes, but ... Look ... he's not going to hurt us. She looks like ... He smiles? Good, now may we go home? It was a real T--Rex. Cool!! Ernie! Look out! Calm down, he did not look being caught. Possible. But you can not make our heads ... ducking. Just relax. Do not you look how cool this. Ernie, he can bite and we could not get out of this place. I think ... Museum has been doing the job ... great to make this sculpture. Feels very alive. It's real .. It's so real? He licked it, like a newborn. It makes sense. This form of time machine like a dinosaur egg. It makes sense. Hello ... Are we like a baby dinosaur? He did not call all of them for dinner, right? No, he called all of them to look at that cute baby. And it looks like they're talking. We are happy you joined Tyra. Yeah, it looks like your eggs do not 've got a hitch. The way you treat us like your son is so wonderful time. And you're entitled to have your own child. You're still keeping us? I mean, maybe Sarco settles then takes us. Come on Neo, do not worry. I'm not going anywhere. You all are my family. I'll take care of Sarco brothers. And when my babies large he will take care of you too. -- What do we have here? -- There is food? I'm very hungry. What's the matter with you, are you nuts? Do you want to get caught? He can hurt you. There's something happening here. What do you see? That's not me. I never lose anything! Really! Stand up! Then why are here to stinks, tell me? I think his voice will not be hard. Will you shut up? Sarco brothers want to know all about Tyra. I have a plan! We must immediately inform him about this. Yeah, right. Amateur basis! Do not make them a voice, they do not sound like us. They look very strange. They are gorgeous. And they will grow big and strong like his mother. Now everything is gone, the baby should sleep. Go. Alright. This is our chance. July, come on, we live a little while. We can set the time machine to go home and mother would never realize if we go. We're not going to get in trouble. This is not about negotiations, Ernie, this on our return home. Max, do you know how to work this thing? Let me see. Should be in the process of initialization ... And the counting process is not working because no power locks. You mean we can not come home on time. It could be any where and anytime. I'll give it to them later, okay? I mean, the mother dinosaurs must have been very angry when the baby suddenly gone. Do not worry on Jul ... I'm sure it must exist in about where we landed. We'll find it. Soon ... Ernie, we're stuck here. Everything will be fine. Look around our July This is Tyra Dino in the Cretaceous period. And? And everything is really great! This is the story of our history. Millions of years before we were born. See, it was Stone Mystery. And the nest is definitely his garage Max, and we may be very close. Home ... Ernie? Dinner time. Ernie Come on, I know you're angry, but at least open your door. Julia, did you see where your brother? Go to catch Ernie. Well, about where he was going. He probably went to the usual place. moment. Hello Sue ... Hello Dr. Santiago ... Please, I hope he called Diego ... Can you come down? Yeah sorry, I'm trying improve robotku Sorry. -- Is Ernie here?. -- Yeah, he's in the garage Max, I think Julia was there. They're looking at Time Machine. Time Machine? When he was busy, let's explore. To search for power key. Ernie, if you were there, I'll say to the mother. It's up to you. I'm having fun. Hi, Mom .. Mother ... Can I go out? Not! Right, you should not go anywhere. There is always a way out, we look lived alone. Oh yeaah. What is it? Yuuki ... Your brother brought gifts. -- Let me see, where is it? Where are they? -- Orphan. Good for you Mom, let me see them. Let me see them. Where are they? They're what?. They have different colors. Had a brother, I finally had a brother. I know one day it will get it. Who will be sleeping next to mom ... And of course it was me. She will sing songs The most I usually prefer. Mutual love among friends, good friends, you know now or not at all. One question, why they look ... weird? What kind of dinosaur is that? Do not know, but it's not the T--Rex. Of course, safe place. Keamanananya guard I painted recently. Well it's not that I'm worried about. What is it? The kids are not here, as did with a time machine. So, this is what? This dinosaur eggs. If I'm not mistaken, this T--Rex. Mean? No eggs in my garage of Cretaceous age. It means the transfer system ... function correctly. That means the kids succeed create a functioning time machine. Sorry? They go back to the future millions of years ago. Sorry??? -- Do not panic Sue ... -- What exactly are you saying? -- I really hate this place. -- Will you shut up! Mr. Sarco, Mr. Sarco more! We are back. Your right hand is back. Mr. Sarco, Mr. Sarco Others? Ah, finally you're here too. Why are you guys so long? They go out for a walk. Let's meet, before we eat them. Do not eat me, I'm just fat. If we do not immediately move out of here, we had no choice. Without the presence of the earthquake and Tyra. Immediately, and there will not be any in this valley will survive. When we get Tyra, then the will we get the other as well. We need eggs, That is what you've come. You'd better bring good news. Or you would hope we take you in just one bite. Boss we have some good news. The news that will make you happy. I saw the baby, it's all three. Yeahh .. They are really funny. You'll want to squeeze his cheeks. Another adoption? Instead, he said they were his own son. And it seems there is still one more egg in there. Another egg? If the egg is taken, he will look for it here. Then we will get rid of him forever. The first night my babies. I can not wait to teach I know nothing. And one day see them saurus being his first defeat. Looks like they will be hard to do it, but it may be? -- All right, go to sleep. -- No it does not. Now it's time to go to search for power key. No way! You will not leave me alone, millions of years ago and in the middle of the night. All right, but we left early. Before the mother dino up. Sue, could you a little peace of mind! No, I would mengguncangmu again, after I took a breath. Hear. Time machine has a system for re automatically in three hours. ... To reduce unnecessary distractions. Thus, the time machine will appeared in, five ... ... Four, three, two, one! I think the clock is broken. Okay, now we're into Plan B. -- What is plan B? -- Start thinking about a plan C. Hear, as scientifically. Is not the key to better search performed three people than just the two? -- Did you see something? -- There was nothing here. Did you hear it? Hear what? It! I'm sure a strange dinosaur again. Her voice is very strange, they came! Maybe you're right. Hey, wait for me! I caught you! You can thank me later. Oh mother would be very upset. Ernie, what would we do? Capture the tree! I do not want to lose my brother. I've just met, wait for me!! What will we do now? Enjoy the journey! Look out! Great rock! Max, hold on to Julia. What would you do? I'll show you a new kind of sport. Gosh. Ernie! Perfect! Well, once again I explained the plan. I swear, if you do not get it. You will feel the consequences. Even though you do not understand, pretend. We will be sneaking into the nest, when he went we took the eggs. I'll settle for looking for something, I was a good penyelinap. Aw, something bit me. Where the poor animals who want to bite you? Help him to pull. I? Why should I do it? And not you? Because I was the leader, understand! Not you. One day I'm gonna slap him. Geli ... amused .. Be quiet, big feet. This thing involves between your fingers. I think the gecko. Why did you not immediately Interesting that thing!!?? We have jobs. Yeah, we never fail. -- Skill? -- 350! Buuyaa! Ernie? Is he being joking with me? Ernie, Ernie, Ernie? Wow, he can talk. He repeats what we say. Incredible!! Good work, helping us from the rocky waters earlier. I'll call you, Dodger! Dodger? Dodger, Dodger! See it, Alamosaurus! The creature was like to live forever. I told Tyra, do not eat when pregnant red meat. Now, they are at blurred. Lambeosaurus, calm them vegetarian. Dude, now you're diligent exercise? I will be able to survive. Once completed. Hey, Pterodactyl! The creatures will protect us from Sarco, I doubt it? Enough to protect her, let's go. This incredible great! And you'll never see it, if I do not break the rules mother. Well, all of this really worth it. Now we can go back home. -- What? Back to the nest? -- No, go back to ... -- Ha? -- What is it? No, I think I'm ... Apparently, the mother managed to find us. We recommend that you regret deeds, Orphan. I thought I could trust my babies to you -- They can get stuck in the bottom of the valley, and if Sarco ... -- Hey, I always notice them. At least my eyes keep eye other malicious ... But Mom, the kids are testing you, you're a good mother, so do I. Then? If they begin to wonder to play itself ... .. Time to teach them survive without me, they are keepers. Mom, they really liked me, and they Dodger call me, I love it. -- Ernie, Ernie, Ernie? -- I'll be there Dodger, but I have to find ... -- I have to find its key. -- Key to Power! Do not misunderstand me, you and your mother both once, and this place was incredible. It's about the other house. Home? Home, home ... Anyone who says that her babies Tyra could scare ... Yeah! Fabulous! Buuyaa! 've Thought of something? I'm afraid Max stuck in Among the many dinosaurs, and you? Did not you become scientists? Yeah, I'm the scientist. And I had to think of a way to restore children like my way of solving scientific problems. Alright. Time to move to the side of the machine others in the same position. -- So that the kids get back to us. -- Wait! Why do they have to come back to us? Is that a trick question? Instead, we can come to them. We do not have a time machine to another. But you managed to get it. Yeah, but it took four years of probation. That's because you do not have an exemplary mother with you. "Mother Rule" Please, give me half an hour to find its key. I had to find its key, and I do not want you to forbid it. -- Max, where Ernie? -- Ernie? -- Ernie? -- I do not know. I do not know! I do not know! Ernie, what happened to you? Him, punishing ... Ernie, Ernie, Ernie ... Ernie, Max, Max again, dino mom ... I ..., Dodger. Hey, look! Did you ever find trail like this before? -- Not. -- They are all around the nest. There seems to be a 're stalking us. I know where they go. Julia, come here! The traces are from river, let us follow. Hey Mom, are you going to let we leave the nest? Well, I also want to see where did this trail. And, good enough for their practice. Exercise, nice bu. That's why you become a mother! The place is secure. Come down, fast fast! Fast, calm down. Be careful not to drop it. Try not to ... I caught it, take care of their eggs. If you mess it up, then you're in trouble. Come quickly. Hold up, hard to manage them. Do not stop, you should fast. Are there tracks, Julia? Yes, this trail is much longer, and I think there are three different tracks here. And they walked together. You're terrific. Almost everything I know, I learned while spying on Ernie. Ernie what's up? You are acting strange. -- Listen friend, I actually have ... -- Hey, look at this! Friends, friends, friends ... The trail comes from down there. Located on the valley floor. Let's check it. Apparently not. What's the problem? We can handle whatever is down there. I guess he will not be let us go. Is this what you feel when mother said no, Ernie? He really knows the place this, we should stick with it. Does your head hit something? If it is better than the nest. Listen, we have to keep baby better. -- Once they get down to the valley floor. -- Not! Not to the valley floor, Sarco brothers there. They have teeth, sharp teeth. And claw for tearing apart! Then the earthquake, and the magma boiling, and the temperature is very hot. We will find a way out. I can not believe my car? Yes, it looks good does not it? You know I never worked this fast in my life. Besides, I never saved my son at the time of the Cretaceous. Simply wonderful to see you work. You know, you make me do it. I've given up, before you yell loudly at me. Sorry. I can see where Ernie gain energy. True. For team work? Oh, I do not ... But why not? Maybe we should sneak and go down there. Julia! Max, they are dinosaurs. They can not understand us. We could be in trouble. The power key. I thought it would never get it again! I mean ... Wait, you think you do not will get it again? What do you mean? I saw and took it, then keep it in my pants pocket. You what? You're in a hurry to go home while I still want to be here. I'm not ready to go back to the mother, regulations, and be punished. Can you trust me? So in other words, you keep us here? We could have been eaten by something. And almost wish we stay here forever. It's like the mother says Ernie ... You do not care what happens to others as long as you can have fun. Well, I found the key to power. So let's go. Time machine! Hey, I do not hide it. We'll never get home. Julia, we'll be fine. It's all your fault. I miss mom, and you no, right Ernie? Of course I miss him. -- My baby is unfortunate. -- What's the problem? It's just an egg--shaped object. Tyra Why not come here? I think he's concerned with this thing. It could be because we do good job. Our team of experts, until he do not know the eggs disappeared. Are not we great? He did not come, because he more concerned with her babies. They are really funny. And so pink. Let me eat it. If they fail to The next mission. Give our babies Tyra, then he will come. Well, should we not planning something? Like what? Wish we could live 100 years again, so that we can meet the mother? Wait ... Ernie, you're a genius! What are you talking about? Julia, the mother asked what we do if we leave the house when she was not there? Leave a message? True! What if we carve message to his father Max ... Shows ... what to do that time machine works. Functioning ... That? Splash of soda in the control panel. True, we'll carve in a place easily seen. Prominent place, such as a building. Always place we see every day. Mystery rock! Exactly! Alright. It is finished? Are you ready? It is finished? Can be tried? I mean, this started to affect me soda. Now we just try it. Come on! Hopefully these things work. I do not understand. I made the same with the previous one. Which previously was does not work, is not it? You're right, it means that the children do something on his time machine. Oow ... Wow, Dr. Santiago careful, we are in a hurry but these houses are our neighbors. Call me Diego. Be careful Ernie, I hate you but I do not want to see your legs broken. Julia, it certainly succeeded. I'm sure. -- I want you to catch it. -- Go, rock climbing it. I think it should he did it. Ernie! Ernie. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Julia! -- Hold this ... -- It? Here you are. Hang in there, Julia! I never omit key, then the time machine. But I'm not going to to miss my brother! Ernie! Let's quickly run! Before we catch something. Restore my baby! Restore my best friend's sister! Oh no! Follow the thief! Oh great! Sorry ... Have you ever seen a baby reptile times pre--history with sharp little teeth? Right over there. Oow .. Call for animal catcher! Hold on. This way, right? My shop, my stuff! We should set him up with something. Go to the "Drive Thru"! -- Welcome to Burgersaurus. -- I need 50 burger, do as fast as you can! -- Are you going to buy a promotional pack or regular. -- You hear, 50 burgers! And two large sodas. Thanks for the ride. Trail, I could follow it. No, it's a trap! Welcome to our home, Tyra. Note, you need more than courage. Julia? Julia! Masamu in this valley is over, Tyra. We will take over the place, now. The time machine. You've got two babies to be protected. It will make you hard protect yourself. -- Sorry, Julia. I can not save you. -- Where's Ernie? I do not know. Geez, I must be doing something. Come on Tyra. Give it up, and we'll make it easier. Not ever! If so, we would doing it the hard way. Come on, get outta here! Find out where the noise was. Try not to eat. That's a great suggestion. Come on! Let's take, little baby. Rightly so. Hemh, if you see me gathering, they would cancel my appreciation. What are friends for? -- Come on, take it. -- Almost there ... A few steps away. Got you! Tyra baby! Oh no. -- Finally, I know we can ... -- Handing on Sarco. I assure you it and of course. Tyra would jump in front of me? Wait, Tyra will jump in front of me? Buuyaa! -- Dodger! -- Ernie! The final goal! Let's find a mother dinosaur! I wish there was a female voice on the island. Perfect, should you do in this situation? Does it smell? Yeah! It was brilliant! It's like the Max plan he learned from Ernie. He was a smart kid and I let him down! Alright, let's settle this problem. Let's go. We found a starting place it happened! Ernie! Hey friends! Friends ... friends. He continued to take care of you. He fights for us. Objects against which we look at the museum, Sarcosuchus. I knew. And I would like them in the form of fossils. Ernie! Earthquake began. Time machine! But Mrs. Dino. Ernie, we do not have much time. Let's go home. -- Wait, we can not leave it. -- No Ernie, let's go! You guys, come on! Ernie, give me the key! Dino mother. Are we sinking? -- Moderate earthquakes. -- Let's get out of here! -- Ernie, Ernie, Ernie! -- Ernie, what is it? Friends! I know how meaningful home for you ... ... But we can not just leave.
