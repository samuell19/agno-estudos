Where you off to? - Oh, I got to go toa friends across town. Bus takes an hour and a half. You? - Job interview at 8:30. - Well, you better hustle. - [Ashley] Meet you at thediner? - Count on it. (car engine sputtering) - Come on. Oh, come on. The bus. (cheerful Christmas music) - Who cares what Forslink issaying. Look, I know what I heard. I've got the tapes to prove it. Claire did the fact checking,everything came back clean. All right. I'm right around the corner. Oh, my gosh. I am sorry.- I'm sorry. - Are you OK?- Yeah, are you? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah no. (both laughing) Sorry, again. - It's OK. With the day I'm having,a train will hit me next. - Ashley Matthews. Job hunting? - Yeah. I gotta catch the bus. - Nice to meet you. (phone ringing) Oh! Hey you! Hello? No, she's not here right now. I'll make sure she gets thatmessage. Morning. (exhales sharply) - You selfish conniving, jerk. - Francine, good morning. I see we're picking upright where we left off. - You just can't resist thechance to slander someone. - Oh, fancy lawyer talk. Actually, counselor, slanderis verbal, libel is written. Fine, libel, don't get mesidetracked. Too easy.- Forslink is not happy. - So? - You know, I don't know why Bobcontinues to print your stories. - Because they're good andthey sell more magazines, which I believe is the point,don't you? - Pat yourself on the back allyou want. You screwed up. - Screwed up? - Please, you act so innocent. Could you just be a man for once and own up to what you did? - I write what I want. - That's for sure.- If you have a problem with that, because it makesyou do your job, deal with it. - Have you even heard one wordI've said? - Not really, I've gottenvery good at tuning you out. (sighs)Francy. If you have a problem with thestory, take it up with Bob. He obviously felt it wasfine enough to print. - You need to stop hiding behindhim. - You're just ticked he's got myback. - Bob wants to see you. - (gasps) Excuse me. Bob wants to see me. - Yeah, that makes completesense-- (knocks) Look, I'll call you back. William Price, have a seat. - What's going on? You only call me by my full name when you've had too muchcaffeine. Is Forslink crying? - Do they have a reason to? - Well, every time I writean article, somebody cries. - Yes, and I'm beginning towonder if that's a bad thing now. - What are you talking about? - I know Claire fact checkedyour story and it panned out at first, but she went back when wegot the screaming complaints and threatened legal action. - Legal? No. They don't have a leg to standon. - Francine agrees, lucky you. But Claire found somethinginteresting when she went through thetapes of your interview. Your source said thecompany was lagging behind, but he meant lagging behindin the so-called green areas. You, however, implied the entirecompany is on the verge of going under. - It is. - And how about you? You took the facts out ofcontext. You spun the story to slamForslink. - Are you firing me? - [Bob] No, but you owe me. - What do you want me to do? - Claire, who feels like thiswhole thing is her fault, bless her heart, is going tobe taking maternity leave, so we're down one fact checker. You'll do her job, justso you can find out what the truth really lookslike. - You're benching me. - Benching implies that this istemporary. When Claire gets backwe'll re-evaluate it then. - Don't do this. I mean, is this Francine's idea? I am a writer. - Fine, write all youwant in your spare time, but I'm not gonna publish a wordof it until you can prove that youcan report and not invent. - Hello. How may I help you? - Hi, I'm Ashley Matthews. I have an interview with, um. - The position's been filled. We called you this morning. - Oh, I don't think you did, areyou sure? - We called. - Because I have my cell phoneright here and I would have heard it ring. - Do you think arguing aboutthis is gonna change the factthe job's already taken? (scoffs) - Oh, Ms. Hendrix. - Hello, Ashley. - Um, about the runningwater in my apartment. - Oh, it's still giving youtrouble then? - This is like the fourthtime it's gone out. Should I talk to Mr. Hendrix? - He's away. - When will he be back? - Very soon. - Mrs. Hendrix, I don'thave any running water in my apartment and it seemsto go out at the worst times. - Oh, maybe it willcome back on again then. We'll get it fixed just as soonas we can. (gentle music) - OK, we got a tomato soup forNick and three-alarm chili forAshley. - Thanks, Dan. - My pleasure. How we doing today? - [Nick] Eh, I manage. - You guys, here you go. - So, how's your friend? - Everything's tasting fine? - Friend? Oh, yeah. He's telling me things I don'twanna hear. How's your interview? - Don't ask. - Well, I already asked, I can'tun-ask. - It did not go well. Story of my life. - So, what happened? - Nick, I really, you know Ijust... - Well you didn't say anythingabout follow up questions. What happened? - OK. Fine. Well, first, when I'm halfway through my shower, the water goes out, again, so I have to wash my hairout in Dash's water bowl. So I'm running late andI smell like dog water. I get to my car and ofcourse it doesn't start, so I have to run and catch thebus and while I'm running Iliterally collide with some random guy, lose myphone, so I don't get the call that the position's already beentaken and I don't need to get on thebus to the interview I'm alreadylate for. (laughs) - Wait, you washed your hair indog water? - I'm so glad you focuson the important things. - That's pretty funny. - And to make it worse,it's the most depressing time of the year. - What do you mean, it'sChristmas? - Yeah, Christmas. It's this soulless commercialendeavor that encouragesoverspending and overeating. - Oh please. Is that all? - No. I mean, the Christmascolors, red and green, even I know those don't gotogether. (Nick chuckles) And what's with the Christmascarols? The Little Drummer Boy? Who's this boy? And drums don't gopa-rum-pum-pum-pum. - Well, there's more to itthen that, don't you think? - Yeah. Christmas is a time to spendwith your friends and family. But when you don't have that, Christmas isn't all it's crackedup to be. - Well you have Dash. - Yeah, Dash. When he showed up on my doorsteplast year it was the best Christmas ever. And before that it was, oh,never mind. All I know is that if I don'tfind a job, I'm going to have to moveout of my cruddy apartment and won't be able to fix my carand worse, I'm gonna have to give up Dash. I know in the big scheme ofthings I'm like, this big, but is it too much to ask for abreak? - Things will turn around. Listen, I got the perfect jobfor you. - Really, what? - Well, it's seasonal, butjust because it's Christmassy doesn't mean you won't like it. - OK, beggars can't be choosers. What kind of work is it? - It's a personal assistant. You run errands, oddjobs, things like that. It gets a little busier thecloser it gets to Christmas. - Where'd you hear about it? - I know the guy that's hiring. - Who is he? - You're looking at him. - I can't work for you. - Why not? - Nick, you can't afforda personal assistant. - I got money. - I'm not gonna take your money. - Well, it's not doing me anygood sitting in the cookie jar. - Nick, I appreciate thegesture, but. - So what's the problem?

Long time, no see, have anapple. - Christmas is coming, you know? - I know, crazy isn't it? - Santa's coming too, any daynow. - Course he is. - Last year he gave me $100. - Wow.

I mean, who do you know? You know me and Dash. You should make an effortto get to know people. - Nick, it took me like sixmonths to even say hi to you. - Yeah, well, I'm notgonna be around forever. You should try and getover your fear of people. - I'm not afraid of people. I just don't trust them, bigdifference. - Yeah, well, a guy asks youout, I say you should go. - And I say you shouldn't worryabout me. I'm gonna go grab myphone and I'll be fine. - What time? - Eight o'clock. - Oh, you'll be late foryour first day at work. - I'm so sorry, I totallyforgot. - Well, I'll let it slide. - I'll be quick, I'llrun down to the diner, meet him and I'll getback as soon as I can. - [Nick] OK, good.

Right to the point. - Thank you.- Yeah. Hey, can I ask you a question? - OK. - It's less of a question,more of an invitation. Do you want to go out some time? - I don't think that's such agood idea. - For you or for me? Or for both of us? - Both of us, yeah. - Why, is there something wrongwith you? - What?- No... That came out wrong. - Is there something wrong withyou? - That's a very valid point.

I'm over-sharing (laughs). I sound a little pathetic here,don't I? - Yeah, a little. But, you know, I'mprobably worse, so it's OK. - Is that a yes? - What?

By the way, don't you havesome fact checking to do? - Yeah, thank you. (knocking) - Ah, you're back. - It was quite some walk. - Yeah. You want a drink of water? - Sure. - Have a seat. - Thanks. Waters out again, huh? - Yeah, I got some bottled. So how'd it go? - Fine. So, what is all this anyway? - It's your work. - Mine. - [Nick] Mm-hmm. - What am I supposed to do withit? - Read it. - All of it? - Well, I'll help. - There's a lot in there it's gonna take me all night toread. - Yeah, well. Thanks.- It'll go a lot faster than you think. I made you dinner. - Thank you. (heartfelt music) Julianne Ryan age seven. Mother is in Iraq with themarines. Lives with grandmother Rose. Rose has Diabetes and needsmedication and a new hearing aid. Julianne needs new shoes. She loves Barbie, anythingBarbie. So who are all these people? - They're people that need help. - There's a lot of them. - [Nick] Yeah, there always are. - [Ashley] So what do you do? - We help them. - We? - You're my assistant now aren'tyou? - How do you help them? This stuff costs money. - Well (groans) I gota little tucked away. - Have you seen this pile? It would cost a fortuneto help all these people. - Yeah. - Where do you get the money? You are dealing drugs. - I'll let you in on a secret. But you mustn't tell anybody. - OK. - I'm rich. - How rich? - Filthy. - If you're so rich, whydo you still live here? - Well a roof's a roof. I'm warm I'm dry. I'm good. - How did you make your money? - Well I was a good businessman, really good at finances. I'm well enough off. - Well enough off. - If I wanted to I couldown a couple of city blocks. - Then why don't you? - I don't believe in realestate. I think people are a betterinvestment. Which reminds me. Here's what we're going to dotomorrow. - So is this what you do? You find people to help. - Well things are especiallyhectic during the Christmas season. I mean people need help all yearround. But, during Christmas thingsthat they don't have and need are much more on their minds. - So you're like aphilanthropist? - Well I don't like that label. This time of year it'ssort of a secret Santa. - Have you ever done anythingfor me? Last year. You gave me Dash. - Minute I laid eyes on him I thought he was perfect foryou. - How did you know? - Well when you first moved inyou had that little pendant. You know that doggy. - [Ashley] Yeah. - But no dog. Thought it was a good match. - Why didn't you tell me? - Well that would sortof defeat the purpose of a secret Santa. Listen to me. These people need your help. And I need your help. Now this is the perfect seasonfor us to stop thinking about ourselves and start thinking about others. - You're asking me toabandon human nature. - It's a requirement of the job. - I don't know if I can. - Well Christmas is three weeksaway. We'll worry about the can andthe can't when we're done. (gentle music) - All right Dash, time to go tobed. We've got a lot to do tomorrow. Come on. OK what are we doing here? - [Nick] People watching. - [Ashley] What are we lookingfor? - [Nick] Well, who are welooking for? - People in need. - Yeah. - But we already have a stack ofnames of people who need your, ourhelp. - Well that's just a smallportion. - There's more? (Nick chuckles) - Yep, yep. Look around you here. Who do you see that needs help? - Him? - Mickey. Well he's a pretty obviouschoice. But not a bad place to start. Who else do you see? - I don't know. - Well look around. Who do you see? (gentle music) - Everyone. - Exactly. See everyone carriesaround a hurt of some kind. It may not be as obvious asMickey here. But everybody needs toknow that somebody cares. - So you just find them bywatching? - Mm-hmm. So who should we help? Hmm? - [Mom] Come on honey,hurry up, it's so cold. - [Boy] But I'm hungry. - [Mom] I know. - Can help them both you know. (cheerful music) (knocks on door) (quietly chuckles) - Mom! Isn't this great? - It's wonderful. Come on help me get this inside. - So how much money doyou spend doing this? - Oh I don't keep track. - You don't keep track? - No, that would defeat thepurpose. - So all those people I metyesterday they're like your spies, yourinformants? - Well, over the years I'vedeveloped a relationship with a number of trustworthypeople. They are my eyes and ears. - And they can keep a secret? - Yeah. - You know I'm stillnot sold on this whole, I love Christmas, aspect of myjob but I got to admit it's prettycool. - Pretty satisfying huh? Yeah, well it's been saidthat if you help someone you're the one that benefits themost. - Is that why you do it? - It's one of the perks. - But it's so much money. - Well a good deed doesn'thave to involve money. I mean you just have to openyour eyes. Be aware of others. Take Stan for example. Do you notice that, somethingdifferent about him? - [Ashley] I don't know. - Something's off. He's not as chipper. - Like what? - Bye. - [Woman] Thanks Stan. - His son died just aboutthis time last year. - I didn't even know he had ason. - Yeah, Tom was his name. He drowned helping someone in anaccident. - [Will] Ashley? - [Ashley] Will. - I'm sorry am I late. - I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I completely forgot. - Well, I guess he reallymade an impression on you. (Will laughs) - Our first date and you'realready seeing other men. - Oh this is hardly a date. - I'm Will. - Nick, Will, nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. - Is it OK if we reschedule? - No, no nonsense. No, I'm gonna order mine to go. Besides I gotta talk to Stanhere. Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. - [Ashley] Sorry. - It's OK. So how late am I? Have you eaten yet? - No. - Is that Nick Anderson? - Yeah, how'd you know? - I've just seen him in somephotos. - Really? - Yeah, at my magazine. I mean he used to be theking of the corporate world. And then one day he just up andleft. I'd love to know what he's doingnow. - Hey, how you doing.- Good. - I got a little water for yourhere. I'm going to take this back. What can I get you? - Oh, um... You know I'll have whatevershe's having. - Are you sure? (laughs) - Yeah. - OK I'll get that right out toyou. I'll be right back. - Thanks. - What are we having? - Stan's three-alarm chili. - Great perfect. So, what do you do? - I'm a personal assistant. - Where? - Just for neighbor. - That's cool. - You're a journalist? - Yeah. No, not really. I'm a fact checker at themagazine. - Oh. - OK here we go, nice and hot. Enjoy. - Thank you.- All right. - This looks good. - I live for this stuff. - Mmm, it is good. It's not really hot forthree-alarm chili. - Give it some time. - So how do you know Nick? - Do you want me to see ifhe can have dinner with you? (laughs) - No, I'm sorry. It's just I get curious. And, it's just that. (coughing) Holy cow this is hot. (coughing) - You OK? - It's just. How is your mouth not burning? (coughing)- You all right? - Yeah, no I'm good. It's good chili though. I'm gonna be honest with you, next time I'm totallyordering something different. - Three-alarm chili, youdidn't think it would be hot? - Good you thought you'dobject to a next time. Maybe do something later thisweek? - Sure. - Good I'd like that. - Oh excuse me, didn't mean tointerrupt. - Hi Nick. - [Will] You guys are neighbors? - [Nick] Yeah. - Ashley, you work for Nick. - Well just some odd jobs. It's harder for me toget around these days. - OK.- Excuse me. - [Will] Mm-hmm. - Good night. - [Nick] Good night. - Well thank you again, goodnight. - Night Ashley. - OK so yeah I thinkthat looks really good. If we could just work on thisone part. - Hey. - OK, thanks. - Ashley and Nick fit together,really? - You know what? I'm busy. - I'm not going to give up onthis. - Why do you need to know? - It's Nick Anderson. He's a legend in my bookand at this magazine. Him and Ashley are ontosomething. - It's none of your business. - Francine. - No, Will, please just backoff. - Oh you never told me how yourdate went. - What's to tell? We met at the dinner, both hadthe chili. He nearly burned his face off. We went our separate ways. - Yeah you going out again? - We don't have anythingactually set up but probably won't happen. - And you want it to? - Maybe. - Seems it was easierto find someone special when I was your age. - I'm sure it was always hard. - Well that's true. But with all the distractions it's easy to forgetwhat's really important. - Heya Nick. - Merry Christmas, Harry. Hope this will hold you for awhile. - Oh sure will. Hey, you stay put, it gets icyout here. We'll get it.- All right. - How are you? (soft music) (knocking) - The GE Story check out? - Yeah. That's not why I'm here. - Apologizing? - Well if apologizing, youmean giving you a great story. - A great story we'll be suedover? - It's inspirational. I ran into Nick Anderson. - The CEO of... - [Will] Yeah. - OK. - He's getting into the holidayspirit by doing some charity work. - OK not groundbreaking but. - Secret charity work. - Let me see the story. - I haven't written it yet. I wanted to make sure thatif I did, you'd consider it. And possibly get meoff fact checking duty? - No promises. - Good. - Francine. - Yes. - Will's onto a storyabout Nick Anderson now. I know he's retired or whatever but make sure Will doesn'tstep on any toes, legally. - Will do. - I can't believe howmany people need help. - [Nick] Yeah. - Sacred Heart was almost out offood. - Yeah, well it's notgood news for a shelter, especially this time of year. - Does it happen a lot? - More then you think. But they're never completely outof food. - You wouldn't let it happen? - No. (beeps) - [Francine] Nick it's Francine, look, I think we may have aproblem. Nothing legal, everything'sset for your trust, but one of the reporter'shere, Will Price, is writing something about you. And I think he has inklingabout your little project. I know you're particular aboutthis, so give me a call, I'll see whatI can do. - Oh goody. Nick, I'm so sorry. - Don't worry. - You used me. - Ashley. - You used me to get to Nick and now you're gonna ruin whathe's doing. - Ruin? This is a great storyit deserves to be seen. - That's not what he wants. - Why not? - I don't know. But Nick has a right to keepit quiet if he wants to. - I just put the piecestogether. It's not as if I sought thisout. But I'm not gonna ignore iteither. - You didn't look for it, yousure? Then why did you tell meyou were a fact checker? You lied to me. - I kept things to myself. So did you. - To protect what he's doing. - You're acting like this is abad thing. This is a great story. It's Christmas. I mean what better story canI write during Christmastime? - It's not about Christmas. It's about him. Nick is the most selflessperson I have ever met and he trusted me with hissecret. And now through some sicktwisted fate you get a hold of my cell phone. And everything's gonnabe exposed because of me. - Ashley wait. - You're a real jerk you knowthat? - Yeah I get that a lot. Listen if you wouldjust let me talk to Nick he will understand. - I can't believe I startedliking you. I really thought youwere interested in me. - I am interested in you. - You are more interested in thestory. - Can I not be interested inboth? - No. Because if you were interestedin me, you'd see why youshouldn't write this story. (sighs) (knocking) Nick. (knocking) Nick. Nick. Nick! (solemn music) - Ms. Matthews. - Yeah? - You're here with NickAnderson? - Yes, yeah. - He's stable and he askedme to come talk to you about his condition. Why don't we have a seat? - OK. - His condition has becomea little bit more grave since last time he was here. The cancer which has beenin remission at this point has returned and is starting toprogress. And it's holding up throughsome of his vital systems. (solemn music) (heart monitor beeping) - Hey I know you. - Nick you scared me. - I scared me too. You talk to my friend? - Yeah, you can beat cancer,Nick, people do it all the time. - Well I beat it twice already. Somehow I don't thinkthe third times a charm. - No, you can afford the besttreatment. - I've had the best treatment. Cancer's back, I don't think mybody's gonna fight it this time. - Why didn't you tell me? - I didn't want to worry you. - What about secret Santa? - It's yours. - What? - Yeah, you're gonna take over. - No, no, no, I can't. - Yeah you can. Francine has drawn up all thedocuments that you'll need to manage it. - Francine, from the magazine? - She's my attorney too. - You've been planning this. - Well, I knew I had topass it onto someone. You're it. - I don't even know where Iwould start. - Start. You're doing it. Huh? By the way there's a guy in thenext room who's having troublewith his hospital bills I want you to check it out forme. OK? - OK. (soft music) (heart monitor beeping) - I ever tell you whyI started doing this? You know, several years agoI was a different person. I was, I was real good withmoney. Great with finances. I had a beautiful wifewho loved me very much. I guess I didn't know how tolove her. My true love was chasing thedollar. And I gave her everything shedesired, I thought, or she wanted orneeded. Wasn't enough to keep us happy. And then she left. And I was angry. I made sure she didn't geta dime in the settlement. I figured I didn't need her. A few years went by andI was still the same. Then I got a letter thatsaid that she passed away. She was the one person wholoved me in spite of who I was. I mean I felt empty for years but after my wife diedI felt useless, alone. So, I quit my job and gave away all the stuffI didn't think I needed, which was practicallyeverything. Eventually I decided thatthis what I should be doing. And that's why I wantyou to continue the work. Because I don't want you toever feel empty or useless. And I certainly don'twant you to feel alone. - Stop talking like you'redying. - Denial doesn't help, honey. I just wanna make sure thatyou're gonna be all right. - Nick promise me you'll stillfight. - Don't be afraid. Why don't you go get some sleep? (knocks) - Francine. - What? - You think Nick would do aninterview. - No. - Not even a one-on-oneinterview. Could be good PR. - He doesn't do it for the PR. Besides with him being inthe hospital right now. He's got other things on hismind. - Hospital? - I thought you knew. Well just don't skew aroundwith whatever you're writing. He's a good man. (gentle music) (Dash whining) (knocking) - I heard about Nick. I'm sorry. - Thanks. - So what are you up to? - Just working, which Ishould probably get back to. - So, being Nick's assistant does that mean you have to do all the Christmas cheer byyourself. - Trying not to think aboutthat. - Want some help? - Why, so you can spy on Nick? - Just help. - OK. - Can I help you?- Hi. - So are we getting an earlylunch before we start santa-ing? - Nope, eat on your own dime. - What are you we doing here? - I'm just making this up as Igo. So, you'll have to wait and see. - [Employee] All right yournumber is 34 I'll call you when it's ready. - Thank you. - [Employee] Hi, may I take yourorder? - Yes, can I get 50 burgers togo please? - 50! - [Employee] 50? - Five zero, to go. - [Employee] OK, 50 burgers. Your total is $149.52. - OK. - [Employee] Here's your change, and I'll let you know whenthat's ready. - Thank you. (cheerful music) Here you go.- Thanks. - Oh I see.

Merry Christmas. - Thanks hun. - [Will] Mickey.- How you doing? - [Ashley] Merry Christmas. - [Will] Good, how are you sir? This is for you. - Thanks.- Later. Ran out of burgers quicker thenI thought. - Don't worry there's more todo. - Can I go get some more? - No. Next stop. - Toy store. I forgot the big red Santa bag. - Discretion is importantremember? That's why what you're writing is so opposite of what Nickwants. - Well, let me talk to Nickmyself. See what he really wants. - Nice try. - Yes, yes, I know, I'm evil. That Santa's list? - Uh yeah, and you're not on it. - Oh, neither are you. - Grow up. - We are in a toy store. Cute. All right, level with me. Where did you get the list? - I wrote it based on somehelpful hints. - From who, I mean is there like a whole network of secretSantas? - Are you asking because you'recurious or because you wanna write aboutit? - We have way more toysthen are on that list. - So? - So what happens to all theextra toys? (Christmas music) (cheerful music) Being a do-gooder takesa lot of energy, huh? - Yeah. - Hey can I get you guys anydessert? - No thanks, I've gotta getto the hospital to visit Nick. - Well listen I want you to tellNick that I'm thinking about him and that he's in my prayers OK. You guys have a great night. - Thanks, you too. What? - Oh, just something Nick said. - About Stan? - Yeah he said his son died lastyear around Christmas in an accident. I just can't stop thinking aboutit. - It's gotta be tough. - I wanna do somethingbut I don't know what. - Yeah, what do you buy thatmakes that pain go away right? Something I can do? - Depends. What do you have in mind? - I could do some digging,see what I find out. - OK. (happy music) So, what do you reallydo for the magazine? - [Will] Really do? - [Ashley] Yeah, I know youlied about being a reporter. - OK I'm a writer. I wrote a story recently about acompany. My boss didn't like it. Said I took some stuff out ofcontext. - Did you? - Not enough to get meinto any legal trouble. - Oh, you must be so proud. - If it makes you feel anybetter I am fact checking stories now, part of my punishment, whatever. So why did Nick pick you? - I don't know. - Liar. - You're the one to talk. - Ouch. - He wants me to be happy Iguess. Especially this time of year. - You're not normally? - Let's just say Christmasisn't my favorite. - Because? - OK I don't hate Christmas perse; it's just a really hard timeof year for people like me. - People like you. - OK, I'm going to stop there because I'm opening up tosomeone I definitely shouldn't beopening up to. - And the wall goes up. - Excuse me? - We haven't known each othervery long but I think it's safeto say you avoid people. - No I don't. - Really? You only interact with Nick andyour dog. - That's not true. - It is OK to talk topeople about your feelings. - You don't care about myfeelings. You just want a background foryour story. - You think I'm asking about astory? - Aren't you? Mr. I got in trouble at work. - Maybe I'm asking because we'refriends. - (scoffs) We're not friends. - We're not? - No. - (exhales) Ouch again. Ashley wait a second. Look, I mean I know women aresupposed to be temperamental but I think you're takingthis to the extreme. - What? - I got you to stop, didn't I? - OK, I appreciate your helpWill. I really do. But I just can't seemto shake this feeling that this whole friendshipthing is a complete sham. - I volunteered to help youremember? I passed out burgers. I helped you buy toys. Plus I put up with yourlovely personality. And when I ask you a simplequestion why Christmas is such a bigdeal, you accuse me of working anangle. - Because you are, whyelse would you be here? - Because I care about you. - No you don't.- Yes I do. - No, you don't. - Huh. Left you speechless. You OK? Did I leave you breathless too?(chuckles) - Oh, get over yourself. - Well this isn't goingto change anything, right? I'll see you tomorrow. (gentle music) - I spoke to Mrs. Hendrixearlier today. - Is she ever gonna get aplumber to our apartment? - I just found out that Mr.Hendrix had a stroke about a month ago and she's hardly been to theapartment because he's at a care facility. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - You never quit do you? - I ain't dead yet. So how'd it go today? - Um... You know, it went pretty good. - Pretty good? - Mm-hmm. I don't know how to tell youthis so I'm just gonna say it. That reporter you got a phonecall about? The one who wants to write astory on you and who I accidentally went outwith? - [Nick] Mm-hmm. - He's helping me. - Well that's interesting. - I couldn't do it alone. And he knows how it works now. He wants to interview you. (sighs) I'm sorry. Nick say something. - You like him don't you? - I do not. (chuckles) - Indeed the couplecertainly would have died if it had not been for theheroic efforts of Tom Manning. And in the end it provedfatal for Manning. (gentle music) - Hey Dash, I'll takeyou out in one second but I've gotta make a call. (gentle music) - Mrs. Hendrix. - Yes. - [Worker] I'll put this in thetruck. - So we did everything youasked. We fixed the problem with thepipes and we replaced all the hotwater heaters. All the plumbing seems to bein perfect working order now. Is there anything elsethat we can do for you? - What? I can't pay for this. - Oh, everything's alreadybeen taking care of. (gentle music) (playful music) - So do you wanna talk aboutlast night? - Mm, no. - OK. (clears throat) So who's house is this anyways? - Oh, it's a little girland her grandmother's. I'll be right back. - OK. (doorbell rings) - Grandma. What's it say? - Dear Rose, I'm awfully busythis year and I wanted to make sure I didn't forget you andJulianne. Toys for your granddaughterand money for your medicines. Merry Christmas, love Santa. (playful music) - You're smooth. - Of course I am. - You know, you're betterat this secret Santa thing than you think. Nick, he's taught you well. - Thanks. - How's he doing anyway? - He said you could go see him. - That's not what I was gettingat. - Sure it wasn't. - He said he'd talk with me? By the way, how long are yougoing to avoid eye contact? - I am not avoiding eye contact. - You're avoiding eye contact. - I am not. - OK. Look me in the eye and tellme you're not avoiding me. - Fine. All right, when do youwant to go see Nick? (gentle music) - I found some stuff outabout Tom, Stan's son. - Please tell me it's not dirt. - Want to hear this or not? - OK. - Last Christmas a car lostcontrol on an icy road. Crashed into a lake. A young married couple wastrapped inside. Tom was driving by jumped intothe water. He got the couple out but hedidn't make it back to shore. They found him a few days later. - Oh Stan. How awful for him. - I made a copy of the articleif you wanna check it out. I thought it would help withStan. - Thanks. - Yeah. (cheerful music) - Hey, it's Will isn't it? - Yes, yes. - Hey girl. - How you feeling? - Oh great. Ashley, would you give us a fewminutes? - Are you sure? - I can handle him. - OK. - Have a seat will you, Will? - Thank you. Um, I'm going to recordthis if you don't mind. - How did you find out about me? - I'm a reporter. I notice things. - Oh really? - Can I ask you a few questions? - I wanna ask you a fewquestions. - OK. - Where are you from? - [Will] Michigan. - Where did you go to school? - Northwestern. - You like writing? - I love it. - You like Ashley. (chuckles) - She's a very nice girl. - Nice girl? She's terrific. - She's a little hard-headed. - Who isn't? - Yeah. I like her. - Let me tell you something,Will. She's had a very differentlife from you and me. She's had to fight tooth andnail for everything she's everachieved. She didn't tell you abouther childhood did she? When she was a baby she wasdropped off in one of those places. She passed around foster carehomes from one to another like adishrag. She didn't have a normalchildhood. Hey, all she's ever wanted wasto be loved unconditionally. - That's not easy to come by. - It's not impossible. See people have let her down. It's hard for her to open up. - Yeah. I picked up on that. - Yeah. But she likes you. Otherwise she wouldn't havelet you in as far as she has. - You think so? - Oh yeah. Yeah. - To be honest with you, sometimes she won't even look atme. - You're not very intuitivefor a reporter are you? The reason she won't look at you is she's afraid that ifshe does she'll melt. (gentle music) - It's about time. - Yeah, sorry. - Did you get everything youwanted? - Yeah. - I'm gonna go check on Nick. - Hey, what are you doing? - I just wanna stretch my legshere. - Oh, can I help? - No, no, don't keep Willwaiting. - He can wait. - How long are you gonna keephim away? - As long as possible. - Yeah. Well, you keep waiting, you'regonna miss something special. Now you go. If I need anything I'll call thenurse. - OK. (phone ringing) - Yeah. - [Bob] Hey Will, we have acover story that we're waiting for youcheck. Preferably before we go topress. - Yeah, working on it. - [Bob] Still writing the Nick Anderson philanthropist story? - Yeah. - [Bob] Let me see adraft when you're ready. Before we finalize the Christmasissue. - OK, will do. - [Bob] And get that storychecked. (sighs) (soft music) (ringing) - [Operator] City information. - Yes, hi, can I get the number for Nina and Aaron Walkerplease? - [Operator] One moment please. - Thanks. - Nick Anderson bears asimilarity to Santa himself. He's old. He's jolly. And if it wasn't for the factthat he doesn't have a beard. So he's the real deal. (sighs) (groans) That's worse. (gentle music) (phone ringing) - Hello. Uh huh. (solemn music) (sighs) When? OK. Thank you. (knocking) Um, that's my apartment. - Ashley Matthews? - Mm-hmm. - I have a letter for you. Sign here. Have a nice day. - Thanks. - [Nick] Dear Ashley, I had ahunch things were going south so I thought I'd write something before my bucket's been kicked. First I want no flashyfuneral or any hoopla.

Did you ever get a chanceto meet my son Tom? - No, but Nick said somereally great things about him. - Nick's pretty good about that. Yeah Tom had a lot of potential. Got a chance to go toHarvard business school on a scholarship. He graduated. Had a job lined up. Hey listen, I'm going on downthe road. You guys enjoy your pie, OK? Have a nice night. - Thank you. - I found the Walkers. - The couple Tom saved? - Yeah, they sent me aletter to give to Stan. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Why? Well. What did it say? - Well I didn't read it. But I bet thank youwas in there somewhere. - Yeah, but what do you sayto the father of the guy who died saving your life. - Yeah. I think it was really hard forthem. - So where's the letter? - Right over there by theregister. They had a baby and they namedhim Tom. - Santa'd like that. k Sit by the fire k Watch the embers glow - Thank you for finding thearticle in the first place. - It was nothing. - So when does your story comeout? - Christmas week with any luck. - Just so you know Nick was OK with you writing something. - He was? - Yeah.

Besides I've got somelast minute things to do. - (scoffs) It's not even mybirthday. - These aren't for you. - I'm shocked. You have that story ready? - Sort of. - Deadline's coming up.

(gentle music) - I have to admit that waspretty cool. I never really thought about itbefore but I mean Elves deservepresents too. - Yeah Nick taught me thateveryone needs something. - Including you. (laughs) - What's this? - Oh. Christmas presents. I can't wrap. But it's what's inside thatcounts. - Thank you. - You survived your firstChristmas as secret Santa. - Yeah first and last for thesecret part. - Yeah, about that. I wanted to apologize. - No don't.

Open it. - OK. - Merry Christmas. - (laughs) What's this? - It's all my secretSanta tapes and notes. I didn't submit the article. - What? - I knew it was gonna be harderfor you. And you were right. Nick wouldn't have wanted that. As we've been doing this projectof his, I realized that Nickwasn't just a secret Santa, he was... he was more of an angel. Christmas Angel. And being an angel isn'tabout the recognition or getting the glory. It's about helping others. - But, I thought youwere writing something? (gentle music) (sniffles) - [Will] One Christmas down. - [Ashley] Yeah and whoknows how many to go huh? - [Will] You ever thinkyou'll get bored of it? - [Ashley] Nah, it'll keep metoo busy. - [Will] You know I was an elfonce? - What? - Yeah when I was 16,I was short for my age and the mall needed helpwith their Santa display. So. - You were not an elf. - All right, I might havestretched the truth there a bit. The point is, I canhelp, you know next year. - [Ashley] How do youknow what you'll be doing? I mean you might be coveringsome big breaking news story. - I can make myselfavailable if you want me to. - Just Christmas? I don't get to see you tillthen? - No, that is not going to workeither. I mean the way I seeit Christmas, crucial. But people need help therest of the year too. - You know I think I can handleit. Then again those presentsget really heavy. (cheerful music) - [Will] Merry Christmas. - [Ashley] Merry Christmas. (cheerful music) (whines) - [Both] It's your turn. - I took him for a walkyesterday. - [Ashley] Mm-hmm. (sighs) - Then why are you getting up? - Guilt. - OK, I'll go with you. - You know we both don't have totake him. - Oh I know. But I wanna see the Christmasdecorations.
