THE WOMAN FROM THE SEA Based on an Original Work by Shintaro Ishihara Starring: Hisako Tsukuba Tamio Kawachi Ryohei Uchida, Shosei Muto, Kojiro Kusanagi, Noriko Homma, Unpei Yokohama Jun Hamamura, Yumihiko Sugi, Sadao Mizutani, Makiko Aoi Directed by Koreyoshi Kurahara - Hey, Toshio. - Hey, Tsutsumi. I was watching you come in from the sea. There wasn?t any wind today, and it was hot. - Have you been here all day? - Since about three. - Really, I thought? - Is something wrong? No, it must have been a trick of the brain. I have the weak nerves of a novelist. A trick of the brain? Are you sick again? I don?t mean to pry. No, I?m much better now. Sometimes wild ideas get the best of me. What kind of wild ideas? - I saw a woman on your boat. - That?s ridiculous. It was probably my big brother. He must?ve brought her. Was he there? If there was a woman on my boat, I?m sure he had something to do with it. No, she was alone. At first, I thought it was you. So, what did she look like? Her hair was long... and her eyes were? Forget it, I?m sure it was a hallucination. It was just my imagination. That must be it. I have to go. You should come over sometime. Nana, get me a flashlight. It?s late. Are you going to use the sailboat? You should think about other things as well. Don?t worry, I?m just going to take a look at it. Tsutsumi, what are you doing there? Sshh? That?s your sailboat out there, isn?t it? - Can?t you hear it? - Hear what? What kind of sound? I don?t hear anything. Just the waves. Really? It was louder before. - You?re acting strange. - I'm sorry. I know I seem odd. I don?t know why it bothered me so much. I haven?t been sleeping well recently. I shouldn?t become so absorbed. Good night, I?m sorry. Who?s there? It?s a fish. What in the world is this?! Damn! Somebody?s gonna pay for this. Who?s there? Who is it? - What are you doing there? - Relaxing. You came out and messed up my boat? I imagine you did last night too! - Is it yours? - Yes. It?s nice. It?s the newest one at the dock. Is that why you made a mess of it?! Don't get angry. I'll clean it up. - What are you doing with those fish? - I ate them. - Raw? - Yes, don?t you? They?re better that way. You just gnaw at them? So, you did this last night too? Why do you bring them to my boat? I didn?t; I caught them here. A lot of fish come here. - You caught them? - Yes, I?m good at it. You?re lying - you don?t have any fishing gear. I don?t need it. I could teach you how to swim, dive, and catch fish with your hands. Get off my boat. I can?t have you making a mess, and I can?t just let this go. - What are you waiting for? - I guess I?m in trouble. Why were you on my boat last night and again this morning? Go home! Actually, I haven?t left since last night. What? Don?t you have a home? - Where do you live? - Around here. - Do you live in one of the fishing villages? - I hate those places. Why don?t you come on board? It?s your boat? - Your hand is warm. - Yours is cold. Your family must be worried if you?ve been here since last night. - No one will worry. - You don?t have a family? - No, I?m on my own. - Do you come here every summer? - Just this year. - Where are you the rest of the time? Here and there... I came here once, a long time ago. - When? - A long time ago. You weren?t around then. The inlet is dangerous. It?s dark, aren?t you afraid? I can see just fine - even at night. Last night, I found something better than fish. - What? - Something good. I won?t tell you. It?s for the best. - Your life must be difficult. - I?m used to it. - Can I go to your place? - My place? Yes, why not? I know where it is. - Oh, yeah? - Then it?s set. - It?s fishermen. - I have to go. - What's wrong? - Goodbye. Hey, who?s there?! Are you one of the people with a summer home? - That?s right. - What are you doing here so early? I was worried about my sailboat and I came to take care of it from last night. - Did you see someone trespassing on people?s boats? - No, what happened? It was awful. They made a mess of all the fish in my corf. They got my boat too. They busted my corf and killed all my fish. I could understand stealing them, but someone killed them out of pure meanness... ripped up and shredded to pieces. And not just us, almost all the boats in the area? - Ah... - What is it? Is this a fish from your corf? - No, where did you get it? - It was crazy, I found a couple of big ones lobbed on my boat last night and this morning. That bonito is huge! Let us know if you see anyone unusual. This has been a terrible summer for the inlet. - Why? - Someone died. - Who? - A young fella from my village, named Shinsaku, drowned. The body hasn?t surfaced, but something must?ve gone crazy wrong for a fisherman to drown. Are you sure he?s dead? Yeah, his sandals washed up on shore. The whole village is up in arms. He was out drinking last night... and swam between two capes, so he didn?t have to walk the shoreline. Someone saw him with a young lady, but wasn?t sure it was Shinsaku. Tell us if you see anyone suspicious. Let?s try over there next! Hey, over here! They?re Shinsaku?s. She?s right. There?s no doubt. From this shirt, I can only conclude that he drowned. - Unless there was a fight? - Wrong! - Why? - It was a shark. - A shark? Damn, it?s back again. It was fate. This is the third time. It won?t go away. - Why was it fate? - I used to laugh too, but now that Shinsaku is dead, I?m liable to believe it. That?s right, it was the curse. The curse killed Shinsaku. A curse? My granddad?s brother, Hide, killed one of a pair of large sharks that inhabited the inlet a long time ago. One night, a woman... was seen weeping unconsolably over the enormous bones of the shark. Soon after, his boat capsized, and his head was bit clean off. We found it floating in the water. Then, 20 years later, my youngest brother, Yasu, disappeared... and when we found him, his arms and legs had been torn off. Grandma told me that dad was killed by the curse of the shark, but I didn?t believe her. Shinsaku was murdered, just look at this shirt. The rip is the same as a shark?s bite mark. - I agree, absolutely correct. - Dammit. But Shinsaku was spotted on returning to his home... from town last night with a young lady. That was me. It was dark, so I can?t say for sure, but I could say for sure that it was his voice. He was a little drunk, but I heard a woman?s voice. It was ghostly. Did Shinsaku know someone on the Motoya shoreline? Did he know her, or was it just a pick up? That ain?t right. The only girls he knew were the town?s barmaids. - So, who?s the girl? - That?s a good point. Lu, stop barking so loud! - I'm home. - Where have you been? You?re gone all day and didn?t even eat your lunch. Did you see the news? A fisherman was killed by a shark! The dog started acting strangely, and I?ve been so worried. Even the dog is upset, you have to be careful. I wonder what?s gotten into that dog. It's you! - I came, just like I promised. - How?d you get in? From below. - Where?d you get that? - This? A man who drowned last night was wearing it. It?s a piece of his shirt. Look, there?s even blood on it. Really? I found it floating in the sea. - Put this on. - No, it's hot. Put it on. What if someone sees you? - Plus, it?s cool today. - It?s hotter than in the water. Quick! Yes? She?s a friend. She stopped by after going for a swim. I had no idea! How did she get in? From the side door. Does she live around here? She?s here by herself for the summer - ain?t that right? By herself? That must be difficult. Please let me know if you need anything. They?re sour! Do you like these things? - I?m ace with a speargun. - I don?t use them. The fish that you said you caught, you actually stole from fisherman?s corves. That?s what they said, anyhow. You'll sure be sorry if they catch you. There aren?t any decent fish in their corves. I catch my own. I?m telling the truth. With your bare hands? If you don?t believe me, we can go fishing together tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - I'll show you where to fish. - You won?t believe the fish there. - All right, but I can?t make any promises if you're lying. - Can I stay here tonight? - What? Yes, it should be all right. No, it won?t! What if Nana comes in? Don't let her in. We'll make like I?m going home. There?s only one bed! I'll sleep here. The sea is noisy tonight. A search party's out, looking for the body of the man who drowned. They'll never find him. Anyhow, can?t I stay? All right? you can have the bed. Damn, this bed is uncomfortable! - It?s time to go. - Huh? You promised last night that we?d go fishing. - This early? - While the fish are still sluggish. And the tide is going out. Hurry. Out for a stroll, Mr. Tsutsumi? Let?s go. - He?s a weird one. - He?s sick. The night before I met you, he said that he saw you. I?m sure it?s not true though. Right here. Hey! Get out of the water! Shark! There?s a shark! Hurry! Get out of the water! - What? - Hurry! - What is it? - I saw a shark! - A shark? Hurry! Hurry! A shark, a big one! - I don?t think so. - No, I saw it! A person?s? A person?s arm! Bit off by a shark! I saw the shirt! It was the same one as the fella that drowned! Did you really see that? Come on, we have to let people know! No, you can?t. There?s no point. The current will carry the shirt away before anyone gets here. Also, everyone will know about my fishing spot. Leave it alone. - And the shark? - Forget about it. - What about the dead man? - He had it coming. - Why? - How should I know? But I?m sure it?s true. You have to promise me. You can tell people what you saw, but not about this place. I'll never forgive you if you do. Hey, come quick! Everybody, come here! - What's the fuss? - Shark! I saw a shark! I saw a severed arm in the sea! Out in the water! An arm? Really? One of the boys from the summer homes found Shinsaku?s arm! Where was it? I was fishing out at sea and I saw a huge shark. I swam away as fast as I could. It was among some boulders. I don?t know exactly where it was. You say you saw a shark? It was huge? twice as big as me. Granddad, did you hear? It?s the shark. It came back. Where did you see it? Around where? I was scared, I don?t know... But I was wearing an aqualung, so it was very deep. Isn?t that right? - What?s wrong, granddad? - I have to go. Me, too. If you need anything, I?d be happy to come back. Hey! - Why were you out at this hour? - Did she come back? - What? - So, no one came? - No. - Thanks anyway. Hey! What? A girl with long hair? We haven?t seen anyone like that. What kind of a boat does she have? - Not on a boat, she swims around here. - What? She swims? - Hey, young fella. - Hello. Did you find it? No, we didn?t know where to look unless we go outside the inlet. If we find it, we'll sure kill it. The young lady you were with - where?s she from? Where? Over there. One of the summer homes? - Yes. - Do you know where she lives? I see. - But... - Yes? - I haven?t seen her since then. - Even at her home? Yes, even at her home. - What?s wrong? - Nothing. Young master, is something bothering you? No, I'm fine. You?ve been acting funny recently. You disappear in the middle of the night. Then, you had a half-naked girl in your room. You?re not like your brother. You always go about your business without a word. What in the world are you up to? - Hello? - Toshio, it?s me. Hi, Gansuke. We?re going to the alps the day after tomorrow. Are you ready? Oh, yeah, the alps. You don?t sound too excited. This was your idea in the first place. Everyone else is ready to go. We leave at 8:00. You'll be there, right? - Is that Toshio? - I?m putting your brother on. Hey, it?s me. How are you? What have you been doing? You must be bored stiff. I?m going to the summer home while you?re in the mountains. Has anything happened over there? No, nothing?s happened here. That?s the story of your life. Do you prefer to be alone? - How are you doing, grumpy? - We'll see you the day after tomorrow! - I wonder what?s up with Toshio. - He?s been moody since we boarded the train. Wow, this is great! What a beautiful place! - Welcome back. - Could you take these? Thank you. Don?t. Stop. It?s beautiful. Do you have a ukulele? A ukulele? Maybe in Toshio?s room. - Who are you? - Where is he? You mean Toshio? He went to the mountains, so I decided to drop in. When will he be back? I couldn't say. Didn't he tell you? You can come by anytime while he?s gone, I don?t mind. Hey! Hot damn. Hot damn, indeed. "Urgent job pending. "Please come to the office immediately. New Style Inc." That address should be fine. Anyhow, she?s really voluptuous. I'll explain later. I owe you one. "Urgent job pending. "Please come to the office immediately. New Style Inc." I wonder what the job is. This stinks, I just got here. Normally, I?d agree, but this says it?s urgent. There?s a designer from Paris in town. It?s something like that. Naah, maybe I'll pass on this one. You should go! You can come back soon. - Take me to the station. - OK. Read 'em and weep, suckas. It?s your turn. Hurry up. Look at that, I win! Is something bothering you? - I?m fine. - You?re a sore loser! - Are you feeling all right? - Yeah, I feel great. I?m a little worried about my sailboat. Your sailboat? Let?s play. I have to make a phone call. You?re in the mountains now, forget about the goddamn sailboat! Hello. It?s you. When did you get there? That?s quite a friend you have here. I really like her. Are you by yourself? Did you come alone? She?s a wildcat - came in through the window. I?m seeing another side to your personality. I can?t believe it! You?re talking to him, aren?t you? Is it her? Is she there? Hey! Hey! Just a second, I'll put her on. Hello, hello, is it you? Yes, it?s me. Why? why didn?t you come back? I was waiting. Ever since then? What?s wrong? Aren?t you coming back? No, I am. I'll be home soon. - I? - I?ve been waiting for you. - Hubba hubba! - Cut it out. - What was that? - Nothing. When are you coming home? Soon - in three days. No, two. At night. I'll be waiting. I'll take care of her while you?re gone. I'll invite her to Hannoura tomorrow, since she?s such a good swimmer. Katsuhiko? don?t. What?s wrong? Get your butt back here. The lady is waiting. Hey, what?s wrong, did your sailboat sink? Here we are. Cut it out! Quick, get over there! - Are you the Nakata party? - Yes. - Is Mr. Seki here? - Yes. - That's me. - You have a telephone call from Tokyo. - From Tokyo? Right this way, sir. Right here. Hello, this is Toshio. Mom? What? Toshio, come home right away! It?s Katsuhiko! What happened? He was lost at sea! Katsuhiko! He left on the sailboat early this morning, and he didn?t return! Later, the unmanned sailboat washed up on shore! It can't be! Come home as soon as you can! I don?t know what to do! Mom? would you be sad if he was dead? What are you saying? Come home right now! I don?t want to be alone! I?m asking you a question. Would you be sad if your son was dead? I?ll leave on the first train tomorrow. Katsuhiko was with the girl. I made coffee for you. Katsuhiko, I can still hear you calling your Nana for your coffee. Nana. Tell me the truth. The girl came here every night, didn?t she? I have no idea. She went out with him on the boat that day. I really don?t know. He told me as much the night before. I?m sure she did. I think that girl is? No, but? I don?t know anything. They both died. Young master... There?s nobody else. - I?m alone now. - Young master, your mother is absolutely crushed by this. She left right after the funeral. I?m better off alone. Young master! No, I forgot. I have you, Nana. That?s enough. I?m going to take a look at the boat. Toshio. I?m sorry. He was your only brother. But there?s one thing I don?t get. How did the boat get back during the storm with nobody on board? What kind of a storm was it? It came suddenly. The storm was worse further out to sea than it was closer to shore. Even the fishermen had never seen anything like it. But... I saw the boat go out that night. You saw? Really? Was Katsuhiko alone? Was anyone else there? Yes... the girl was there too. I see. So she died too. But she was such? Young master. You?ll catch cold out here. You have to forget about Katsuhiko. I thought something bad would happen that night. That girl? Pipe down, Lu. It?s late. Shut up. What?s the matter with you? Be quiet already. It?s you. I knew you were still alive. I knew you didn?t drown. - What happened to my brother? - I don't know. You don?t know? But you were with him on the boat. - People saw you. - Your brother is dirty. - He?s dirty? - Yes. He tried something funny. That?s why I didn?t stay on the boat. Why did you keep quiet? Why didn?t you tell anyone? What?s the point? I?m alone in this world. But now you are too. That's right. But... I came back. I knew you didn?t die. I knew you were alive somewhere. You were right. No more... I?m not leaving you again. You have a visitor, Toshio. Who is it? I?ll be there in a minute. - I?m going home. - Why? I just wanted to see you. But? that?s all? - I?ll see you tomorrow. - When tomorrow? Around this time. I?ll be waiting in the boat. That way, no one else will be around. - Really? - Goodbye. What is it? Is the girl in your room? You brought her here before, didn?t you? Katsuzo and me saw her last night. Toshio! - What did she do? - She?s still in your room, isn?t she? - She?s still here! - Isn't she? No, she left. How do you know her? - What do you? - Where and when did you meet her? - On my sailboat. - On your sailboat? She'd been swimming and was resting there. She had caught some fish. - Fish? - A bonito about this big and a sea bream. She?s an excellent swimmer. She catches fish by hand. - See, just like I sez! - That?s definitely her! - What is? - You can?t. You have to stop. You absolutely must never see that girl again. - Why not? - She?s preying on you. - She?s preying on me? - Just like your dead brother. The girl?s a monster. - A monster? - Yes. I?ll tell you. I?ll tell you. I?ll? I saw her when I was a young man, just newly married. She was dressed the same and had the same pretty face. It?s not possible! The old man?s brother died, then my brother died. Now, my son Shinsaku has died. With every death, that girl has appeared. Granddad has seen her every time. It?s obviously been three different women. It?s true. I?m telling you the truth. That girl is... the spirit of one of... a pair of sharks that grandpa Hide killed. How many girls do you know that can swim... in the depths and catch fish with her hands? I know it sounds crazy, but it?s true! Nobody knows where she lives! When will she be back? - When? - You?ve got it all wrong! No, we don?t! It?s true. We won?t be able to live safely in the inlet... until we do something about that girl? that shark. - When? When is she coming?! - No, I won?t tell you! - Tell us! Tell us! - Don?t! - Please, stop! - Lies! You?re all wrong. - We?re not wrong! - Lies, I say! - She?s using you! - I don?t care what you say! What did you say? Calm down. She?ll turn up again if we just wait. I know it sounds crazy, but it?s true. That girl?s a shark. And when we find her, we?re going to kill her. We?ll be watching the inlet, and we will kill her. Don?t say anything about this, or you?ll regret it. They?re wrong! They?re wrong, Nana! - You can?t believe them?! It?s ridiculous! - But? - What? - I knew she was still alive. - Just as I thought. - What? When you were gone, I could tell she was in your room. When I went in to clean, there were fresh saltwater stains on the floor. She had snuck in to see you. To see me? She'll be killed. The fishermen will kill her! Nana, what should I do? They?re going to kill her! I? don?t know! What should I do?! You poor thing! Dammit! I won?t let them! I won?t let them kill her! Sssshhh? Hurry, hurry. - What?s wrong? - Big trouble. - They?re coming to kill you. - Why? The fishermen are looking for you. For me? Yes, they vowed to kill you. They?re fools. But there?s no telling what they'll do. But why? Why? It?s a stupid legend. They say you?re a shark. I don?t know where they?re looking. They said they?d be watching the inlet. It?s not funny, they?re like barbarians. They will kill you. Don?t you care? I care. What should I do? - I'll save you. - But how? - You can run away with me. - With you? Yes, we can get away tonight, in the boat. All right? - I... - What? I love you. What?s wrong? I?m so happy. We'll get away tonight at 11:00. I'll be waiting for you. I'll bring a lamp. Young master. Nana, pack the leftovers, some fruit, and sandwiches for three or four. Are you going somewhere? - This late? - Yes. Young master. Nana, I might not be back for a while. - Where are you going? - To Gansuke?s place. Nana, I can trust you. The girl isn?t a monster. I saw her again. When I told her they?d kill her, she cried. But I'll save her. If I don?t, she'll be killed. And then? I?m going to take her away tonight. I can?t let them kill her. Don?t do that, leave it to the police. The police are all in cahoots with them. Don?t worry, I'll come back once I get her to someplace safe. Look, do you trust them? They said she?s a monster. Wake me at 10:30. Nana, this is a secret. I don?t know what they?d do if they knew I was taking her away. But I trust you. OK? Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana! Come on! We have to do something. She should be here soon. This is where the Nana said the girl would be. She said 11:00. Nana! Nana! Dammit! Nana! Hey, it?s her. Dammit! We did it! Granddad, we took our revenge! I saw it with my own eyes! It was a big, big shark! It?s the boy. - Where is she!? - Granddad was right! She was a monster! A real monster! The smell! Smell for yourself! It?s not human blood, it?s fish blood! I stabbed it three times! No, four! Where is she?! She got away! Disappeared to die in the deep! I stabbed her four times! After the last time, it disappeared in the sea. You?re wrong! I saw it with my own eyes! I locked my eyes on her when she came out of the sea naked, and I skewered her from behind! The creature spun around with a froth of blood spewing from its mouth! Another man stabbed her in the groin! It writhed with great fury! And while it was writhing, it transformed into a huge shark! The shark was blue, black, and shining silver. It was nearly twice my size! I was terrified and shaking! Even in the dark, I could see its black eyes and white teeth writhing, with its white belly in the air! The third spearman stabbed it in the back of its neck. Then, the creature jumped up and shook the three of us away. Finally, Grandpa made the final thrust, clean through the creature?s belly. The creature again spewed a froth of blood and disappeared into the sea. Look for yourself! Look at the guts on the boat! We'll never see this fiendish monster in the inlet again. You?re lying! You?re all lying! Everything is a lie. You?re lying! You?re lying! You?re lying! You?re lying! Have a safe trip home. Young master, I will join you as soon as I take care of a few things here. - Hey, Toshio. - Hey. - Are you going home? - Yes. I see. I heard what happened. I don?t understand it. I guess what I saw wasn?t a trick of the brain after all. It was so strange; I assumed it was just because I was sick. I had been far out at sea that day, and when I came back, I saw a girl dive into the water from your boat and, as she approached my boat, I realized she'd turned into a large shark. But, I don?t believe it. It?s all right. Believe. What you saw was real enough. There really was a girl. I... still remember her. Her eyes were large and her hair was long. Her slim arms and legs. She came for you. - But... - Don't. Toshio, you were chosen. The dream that you had will be yours forever. It?s a beautiful summer dream. It?s a dream that no one else could have. It was only for you. Don?t ever doubt your dream. She came for you. The End Translation: Scannon Timing: lordretsudo
