Now don't make me come up there. l think he's dead. No, he's playing possum. He's dead, l'm telling you. - l think he's dead. - l told you he was dead! Okay okay, you're right. You happy now?! Uh, he killed him. - lt was the heart-- - Shut up. Get rid of the body and then find the prototype. Search his hotel room. Do whatever it is you have to do, but you'd better find it. On a peaceful evening in the spring of 1931, gang warfare had broken out again with sudden violence on the streets of St. Louis. ...as the undisputed boss of the city was fighting the challenge to his leadership. And the challenger was an upstart hoodlum-- Hey! Hey! Hey! - Excuse me? - What do you think you're doing? What the-- Uh, St. Regis Hotel, please. Uh, first l go St. Regis Hotel. Then l go Riverside Hotel, visit friend. Come on. Hop in, papa-san. - You going to bust Weston? - Mind your own business. This is my business. He just bought $200 worth of cookies. Look, kid, it's a police matter. Tough break. Yeah? Can't you wait until l get paid? - No. - Weston! - Hey! - Weston! Shut up, will you?! We'll buy the cookies, okay? Give me some money. - What do you got? - Here. Come on. Give me the rest. There's 30 plus 10-- that's 40 bucks. - That's more than enough. - What about the rest? - Uh... - Dingman. Dingman. Yeah, here, go to this address. Ask for Officer Dingman. Shit. - Ready to go? - Yeah. Police! Freeze! This must be a Nielson family. Weston! Weston! - Drop it. - Police. Stay cool. - Show him the warrant. - What warrant. l ain't got no warrant. You were supposed to go to the judge today and get a warrant. - Oh, l forgot. - You forgot! Then this guy hits us with a big fat lawsuit is what you forgot! - l'm sorry! - l'm sick of your goddamn problems! Hey! Shut up! You mean you guys don't have a warrant? Well... take me in. Please take me in. Don't forget my phone book. lt's got my lawyer's number in it. Show him. - What's that? - lt's a warrant. Forgot l had it. Read him. lnspector, whatever you want inside, half price. l need to talk to you a minute. - What's the matter? - lt's about your buddy Mac. - What happened? - He's been shot. Shot? He's not even a cop anymore. - Yeah, l know. - An accident? No. lt was at the junkyard. Um... uh, yeah. Shortcut. - Yeah, all right. - Costas, don't get involved. You guys get promoted to Homicide? l thought you were Robbery. You call Homicide a promotion? Hey hey hey. They must have wanted him very dead to use that kind of artillery on him. - What kind is that? - Gyrojet rocket gun. - A what? - Rocket gun. Stopped making 'em in '72. There can't be many of them around. lt fires an explosive rocket shell bigger than a .44 magnum. No shell casing. No nothing. Very hard to trace. Wanna see the other guy? - What other guy? - Dead Jap. Would you call a Jap a John Doe? What's that? lt's a hotel card key. Hey! The hell you two guys doing here? The other guy that got killed was a buddy of mine. Yeah, well, l'm sorry to hear that, but this is a homicide. l don't want two jocks from Robbery messing with it. Yeah, well you're in Homicide. - So who did it? - lt's an open and shut case. Jap bashing. Some unemployed autoworkers got a couple drinks in 'em. They see this Jap so they start to work him over. They get carried away, then they gotta come here and dump the body. - Brilliant. - You got it all figured out, don't you? lt's just too bad your buddy the night watchman had to be - in the wrong place at the wrong time. - Hey! What do you think, unemployed autoworkers are using car crushers to dispose of bodies now? ln 30 years, the guy never fired his gun once. Then he gets shot in a junkyard guarding junk? lt doesn't make any sense. l mean, what the hell is there here to steal? The sad thing is, as far as Dingman's concerned, the case is solved. That's why l want to take the electronic key and go down to the hotel and see what l can find out. - Do me a favor, will you? - What? You don't mind riding home with Dingman, do you? l'll make it up to you. Thank you very much. Hi! How you doing? Police officer. l wonder if you could tell me what room this is for? Hey hey, we're the Monkees. Cut it out now! Get 'em up. Come on. Get 'em up. Give me security. l know he's not registered. Hotel security! Just hold anybody who looks different. Hey you! Hold it! Hey! Hey! Hey! Shut up, lady. You're not on a game show. Police officer. - Cover me. - l'm on it. l don't think we need quite this much firepower. Let the people through. Come on, folks. Come on. Welcome to Detroit. Nice to see you. - First time here? - Yes. Welcome to Detroit. Thank you. Come on. All right, here we go. Damn! He must have gotten off at the mezzanine. Down there! Down there! Look at that! Look! Stop that garment bag! Freeze! Get 'em up. Get 'em up. Drop the bag. - Yeah, that's okay. - You want me to sign this? l'm telling you-- l've told you four times now. What do you got for me? You got some messages from your girlfriend. No this one's no good! - Hey, Dingman. - Yeah? You know that dead Japanese guy we found in the junkyard? Yeah, this the guy? No, this isn't the guy, pinhead! l found this guy nosing around the dead guy's hotel room. Damn you, Costas. l warned you. This is Homicide. Stay away from this case. What do you mean ''hotel room''? What hotel room? Uh, just took a wild stab. You know, check a lead. No, you mean you withheld a piece of evidence from a homicide case from an investigative officer. Now get your ass in my office. l told him to stay out of it, sir, and not the first time either. He just doesn't listen good. Yeah? What you grinning about? You let somebody else solve your case for you. Now question the prisoner. Come on. Do you know my mother got two TV sets ripped off in the last six months? - RCA 25''. - You know, l got a lead on that. Just shut up. Now do see me running around trying to find the sons of bitches that took it? No. Because l expect Robbery to do it. But where is Robbery? Out trying to solve homicide cases! And in the meantime, l am the poor son of a bitch that's got to buy my mother another TV set. Speak any English? Hmm? Well, that's okay. l talk some Jap. Toyota. Mitsubishi. Kawasaki. Teriyaki. What do they call you anyway? Tojo? Honda? Sushi? Sanyo? What do they call you? Read my ''rips.'' Fu-ji-tsu-ka Nat-su-o. Detective First Class. Tokyo Police. Come on with me. Detective First Class. Come on. Amazing, Costas. You bust another one wide open. Come on in. lnspector Ryerson, l would like you to meet Fuji-kaka Na-na-what? - Fujitsuka Natsuo. - Yeah, right. Detective First Class, Tokyo Police. What? Are you telling me that he is a cop? Wait till the State Department hears about this. Costas, you bust a Jap cop and you've created an international incident. lnspector Ryerson's office. Hang on. Somebody order Hunan? lt's Tokyo, sir. l called his superior. l wanted confirmation. So he wants to speak to you. Jesus H. Christ. Didn't you question this man before you arrested him? - l tried to-- - Just shut up. Hello. lnspector Ryerson here. Say what? Here. This is for you. Thank you very much. Godzilla's attacking the city. For the love of God, stay in your homes. Will you shut up? My superior... wishes to express great admiration for world-renowned Detroit Police Department. Will somebody ask him what he was doing in Oshima's hotel room? Shut up, Costas. H-hello? l'm sorry. We have a bad connection. l call him later. lf you're so legit, why'd you run away? After reading so much about crime rate in Detroit, l mistook you for hoodlum. My apologies. lsn't that a coincidence? Having heard about the crime rate in Detroit myself l mistook you for a criminal. Enough foolishness. lnspector Ryerson, Mr. Oshima embezzled a great sum of money. l was sent to convince him to return to Japan and possibly save face. But unfortunately, in trying to save Japanese face, l also tweak nose of American law. Hey, pal, l've seen your face. - lt ain't worth saving. - Costas, out. Am l wrong here?! - You heard the inspector, right? - Out! Look, check this out. - You know that dead Japanese guy? - Yep. Turns out he embezzled a ton of dough from some big company in Japan and they sent Tojo to investigate. Here's the part that doesn't make sense. The guy's got all this money. Why does he come to Detroit for a good time? He never heard of Rio? Look, l want to know everything this guy did. - l want to know if he had a rent-a-car. - He did. Budget. Picked it up at the airport. No, we haven't located it. Yes, l will go over it with a fine-tooth comb. Look, l'm gonna follow this guy, okay? While Ryerson and Dingman are playing Kabuki theater with Madam Butterfly l want to know everything that this guy does. - Unofficially. - Unofficially. lf l lose my pension, the wife and kids move in with you. Hey, that's okay. - Your wife's a piece of ass. - Hey, cut that shit out! That's my wife you're talking about! A man's woman is sacred. Can you spell that, please? F-U-J-l-T-S-U-K-A. - And what's your address? - Tokyo, Japan. Well, sir, these should be ready in about an hour. Here's your receipt. Just bring this back when you come. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Those photos that guy just dropped off, - can l take a look at 'em, please? - l'm sorry, sir. - We're not allowed to do that. - Official police business. He just put 'em in. They haven't been developed yet. Why don't you give me your number? l can give you a call - when they're ready. - They'll be ready in an hour, sir. - ln an hour? - Yeah. Excuse me. - Thank you for waiting. - Sure. l get out here, please. - Keep the change, thank you. - Thank you. As all of you know, l've been in the auto industry most of my life. l've developed some of the finest cars that have come out of Detroit. But l'm here today to tell you the Jarryd Starburst tops them all. Mr. Jarryd, thank you. Tell me... what makes you think you can go up against the Big Three, sir? The Jarryd engineers have just had a revolutionary technological breakthrough that's gonna take this industry by storm. - What is it? - That's all l can say about it now. l can't tell you more about it now. - Mr. Jarryd. - Yes, ma'am? From all reports, you are an undercapitalized company. With your limited resources, how can you possibly mass-produce this kind of car? l didn't come here today to answer questions about a balance sheet. l came here to show you a new car. The Jarryd Starburst. The car of the future. A car built up to a standard, not down to a price. Thank you. You wonder what that Japanese fellow there is scowling at? You're gonna be out of a job, fella. That's all l have time for, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. Thank you. You were supposed to negotiate with him, not kill him. He had a bad heart. Want something to eat? Our relationship is over. Your loan will be repaid in full. l'll find a way. - Who do you think you're kidding? - l've instructed-- l've instructed my attorneys to inform you you're not to have any further contacts with the Jarryd Motor Company, understand me? There is no partnership. There never was. There never will be. Don't do anything rash, Derek. Oh, you-- you think you can scare me with your thugs? Do you know who you're dealing with here? l'm Derek Jarryd. l have a lot of friends in this town. l can get the governor on the phone and the chief of police. Sounds like a threat. lf you want it to be, fella. Hey! l'm not finished talking to you yet, Derek Jarryd. Mr. Motor City. You're right. There is no more partnership because you are out. - l'm out? - Yeah. Only you don't have to be too depressed about it. You can go on making your speeches and getting your picture in the society page, but we're gonna know that you're just my little puppet. Leave. Go sell some cars. Make us some money. Out! Oh, and by the way, Scully here's gonna be keeping you company, just to keep you from getting lonely. Although we need some kind of title for him, maybe a vice president. Something in public relations. Naughty naughty. Must not read that kind of stuff. Only gossip. Film, please. Sure. Mr. Fujiski? - Fujitsuka, Tokyo, Japan. - Oh, okay. Just a second. Okay, here you are. That's $14, please. Oh, yes, $14. You have a $15 smile, so you keep the change. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you very much. Thanks, babe. You'll make a swell cop someday. How's it going? Hi. Costas, Detroit P.D. Just doing a little spot check-- doors, windows, checking your bushes for people. That kind of stuff. Nobody told me about any spot check. lf you knew about it it wouldn't be a spot check. That would ruin the surprise. - Hold on, let me get my supervisor. - Wait a minute. You don't need any supervisor. l just wanna take a little look around. When you got the best security in the business, nobody gets in without clearance. l guess it would be pretty hard for somebody to sneak through here, huh? Hard? lmpossible. - Must be something metallic. - Oh, probably my gun. - Try it now. - Let's see. Yep, that was it. Funny how that works, isn't it? Your boss Lieutenant Shortcake says you check out. Oh, terrific. You guys are certainly professionals. l don't know how anybody could sneak past you two. You know, we both t ook the test to be police officers. Law enforcement. Yeah, that civil service examiner, - he had it in for us. - Didn't work out. Probably some personality thing. - A lot of times they get jealous. - Yeah yeah yeah. Let me ask you, a guy like that janitor, l imagine this would be a pretty tough job, huh? All our maintenance personnel, we screen them pretty carefully, yeah. Access codes change daily. Really really? - Now that room he's going into now... - That's R&D. Research and development is top secret. Mr. Jarryd, myself, this gentleman, we're the only ones who know where it is. l'd be curious. Where is that? Third floor, last door on the right. l'm gonna go take a little look. ls that okay? - No problem. - Oh, great, you fellas are terrific. ln fact, l'm gonna call the civil service people. l'm gonna speak to them about you two. l think you deserve another chance. - Thanks a lot. - l'll make a call. Let me look around. - Hey, thank you. - Detroit P.D. Motor City's finest. A plainclothes dick. A gumshoe. Computer-san, you talk to me. What's the matter, pal? Out of quarters? - Oh, Detective Costas. - Little late for Pac-man, isn't it? Just the man l need to help me with investigation. Help you? You know, l oughta stir-fry your face. l don't know where you come from, but around here, breaking and entering is against the law. l make bargain with you. You help me, l help you find man who shoot your friend. Bargain. You got nothing to bargain with. l'm gonna bust your ass. Bust my ass no good. You arrest me, somebody new come from Japan. Then you have nothing. l'll arrest them too. l can arrest people from Japan all day long. You know why? Because l think you're a spy. l think you're stealing industrial secrets from Jarryd Motors. No, no spy. This much l tell you. Story about embezzlement not true. Not true? l am shocked. l tell you rest on need-to-know basis. Need to know? l'll tell you what l need to know. l need to know why l shouldn't put my foot up your ass. Reason very simple-- most uncomfortable position for both parties. Now you know why we do these spot checks once in a while. l think you both learned a little something here tonight. Come on. Come on. Damn, those guys are good. Detective Costas, you give me one day, l show you man who shoot your friend. You want a day? l'll give you a day. You can have last Wednesday. Destiny bring us together, you know? Destiny? Your destiny is one-to-five at Jackson State. They're gonna love a guy like you down there. They'll dress you up, play house. Enough of this! Stop, police! - l don't need this. - Take off cuffs. They going to escape. Don't tell me how to do my job. Thank you very much, Detective Costas. - l could be of assistance. - Yeah, you can watch the car. What you did was not nice, young man. Old people must be treated with kindness, respect. Someday you will get to be old. Yeah, man, okay. What the hell is going on here? Get the hell back down there. l took the liberty of apprehending suspect. Tony-san, Detective Costas, l told you we make great partner. l could have run away, but l did not. You need me for investigation. l need you. Together we bring murder suspect to justice. All right, cut the theatrics. You got one chance, pal, one shot. That's it. We're even. That's it. Come on. - Come on. - You have the right to remain silent. Come on, let's go. Oh, Tony-san. Where this? This is not my hotel. That's some pretty clever detective work, Natsuo. This is my place. Come on. l'm not letting you out of my sight. l see. You no trust me. You think maybe l run away. Where l gonna run away to, huh? We are partners. Yeah, we're partners. We're partners in the way Sears & Roebuck are partners. What you mean Sears Roebuck? You know Sears, the big department store? lt used to be Sears & Roebuck. Then Roebuck one day took a three-day vacation, came back, found his name off the building. - Really? - Yeah, tough break, huh? What are you doing now? Take off shoes. Show respect for house. Suit yourself. Tony-san, you have pet? l had a dog a couple years ago. l think better l show respect for foot. Come on, sit down.

Breaking and entering. Withholding evidence. l think you make a better crook than you do a cop. You like that, huh? - You have big sense of humor. - Oh, yeah. We must do... must do banzai. - Banzai! - Yeah, nice Japanese banzai. - Banzai! - Banzai! - Banzai! - Banzai! - Banzai! - Banzai! 1 2 year old.

Hey. l just think we oughta live together for awhile first. Detective Costas, very bad neighborhood. Bad neighborhood, huh? This used to be a great neighborhood. When l was a kid, this whole area was alive. And then you guys came along with your tin can cars and slave wages, put everybody out of business. Now l know why you don't like me. You blame all Japanese for problems of Detroit. No, l don't blame all Japanese. - l just blame you. - Huh? Blame ourselves for getting fat and letting it happen. What? ...sophisticated engine in a sports car today, with an onboard computer that continuously monitors operation as you drive. The result-- uncompromised performance at all operating speeds... Now let me get this straight. What you're telling me is Ford held the gun and GM pulled the trigger. - ls that what you're trying to say? - Patience, Detective Costas. You know something? l think l see our suspect now. Where? The production team assembled the car with ultimate care... - Don't make joke. - l'm gonna question her. ...operation as you drive.

Excuse me, please. l believe we have a mutual friend. My business partner, Mr. Oshima. He suggested perhaps we could talk. - No no, l'm afraid l don't know that name. Mr. Jarryd is late for a meeting. Perhaps l can help you, Mr., uh... Johnson. Duane Johnson. Why don't l get your number and we'll get back to you? Duane, is it okay if l call you Duane? Yes, of course. Thank you very much. No need to go to all that trouble. Later. Well, nice going, Duane. Who's your next suspect gonna be, Lee lacocca? l wanted to make him panic, hope to force him into error. Error, what kind of an error? Look at man he arguing with. Do you want to stay with the program, - or do you want to embarrass yourself? - Don't make a scene. You may be onto something. That guy didn't look like he had anything to do with cars. Also, president of company must not be treated like piece of shit. l think we should get to know tall skinny fellow better. ''Piece of shit''? Where do you pick up this kind of talk? Over there. Sir, it's an Oriental gentleman who claims to be a partner of Oshima and someone whom l suspect to be a Detroit policeman. Shake him but don't do anything illegal. lt's done, sir. Do me a favor, run a make. Michigan 5084PG. Roger, 2370. Why you don't just pull him over for questioning? You want to scare Jarryd. l want to scare this guy. We'll make him nervous.

You brought those heavy tariffs on yourselves by dumping underpriced computer chips on the market. Hey hey. That's it. l got it handled here. Hold it just a minute. Everybody must understand Japan is a very small country, and we only do what we can to compete in world market. Yeah, but surely you can't compare-- What do you think is this, ''60 Minutes''? What he mean by ''60 Minutes''? ''60 Minutes'' is a popular news and entertainment program-- You shut up. Hey, man. Every American should be an ambassador of good will. - Yeah, that's right. - Yeah.

Now l tell you whole story. Whole story. Gee, l'd love to hear the whole story. Not that kind of story. Truth. You see, Oshima stole revolutionary new turbocharger. l think he want to make deal with Jarryd. That's why they send me, bring him back to Japan. You got proof of this, or you just make it up as you go along? No no no. l see guilty look in Jarryd's eye. Guilty look in eye? With that kind of hard evidence, we should get a conviction overnight. Guilty look in eye. What kind of Mickey Mouse criminal justice system you got in Japan? Mickey Mouse American invention. That's right. You guys aren't clever enough to think about it. We have Disneyland now near Tokyo. - Do not. - Do too. - Do not. You lie. - Do too. No lie. Just picked up Oshima's rental car. They're going over it now. lt's clean. Anything on that guy Scully? This guy's done everything but rape Bambi. There's several weapons charges, assault and battery, beat a murder rap in Sarasota for insufficient evidence. He used to run a survivalist camp. Survivalist camp? You got an address? 1943 Central. That's great. Thanks, pal. l'll talk to you later. Nice house. How many family live here? - One guy. - One guy? Oh, 1943-- good year.

You don't need a warrant if you have probable cause. - Probable cause. - Probably cause. You don't smell that gas? Mnh-mnh. - You don't hear the baby crying? - Baby crying? Oh, probable cause. Must hurry. Neighbors hear alarm, call police. ln America, when people hear an alarm they just yell, ''Turn that shit off.'' ''Turn that shit off''? Hey, turn that shit off! Oh, that's better. - Jesus. - Holy shit-o. Do you think this guy was into home protection? Too many guns. No, all Americans live like this. - Really? - Oh, sure sure. - You're putting me on. - No, no. Hello. Hello! - lt's Scully here, sir. - What is it now? - l have cornered the enemy. - You've done what? They're in my house. ln your house? l told you to lose them. You got rid of that murder weapon, didn't you? Excuse me, sir, but the for mentioned item is in the house. Brilliant. Now you get rid of it. l don't care what you have to do. You get rid of it. Done, sir. Excuse me. Tony-san. - Look what l find. - What do you got? Strange looking weapon. - Hey, it's the gun that killed Mac. - How you know that? Here. Been reading all about it. Scully. We got a surprise for him. l think he have surprise for us. - Get up! Get up! - l think we make him angry. Follow me. Take this gun and cover me. Cannot. Japanese police don't use gun. Shut up. Get out of Benihana's now. Just cover me! No good, no ammo. - l got him. - You got him. They got me. - Go! - Good idea. Not safe here. - Give me that. This is empty. - Oh, yeah. Now take this. Take this and cover me. Cover you, yes, sir. Shoot anything that moves, all right? Now listen, there's one shot left in there. So we gotta make it count. l understand. You asshole! l'm sorry, Tony-san. - What are we gonna do now? - l don't know. Ha ha. lnteresting culture. You won't carry guns, but you carry grenades. Jesus! Scully, let's talk about a deal. Look, l got the rocket gun. lt's the only thing the cops can use to link you to the murder. l'm gonna throw it out. Wait! Wait a minute! That's not the whole deal. Look, l got the plans to the turbocharger. l'm gonna wrap it around a rock and throw 'em out. You'll be a hero to Jarryd. l sense your interest. Look, here it comes. Good faith and all that. l know you're basically a pretty decent guy. Here it comes. Oh, Tony-san, l think you avenge death of friend now. Wonder if there's any way to figure out who Scully was talking to. Very simple. ln Japan we have recall button. Oh, see, number come. Hello. Huh? What means ''flee crinic''? Sounds like Polish name. ''Free crinic''? Maybe a restaurant or something. Hi, to whom am l speaking, please? Sir, this is the Free Clinic. The Free Clinic, you idiot. Come on. - Let's get down there. - Oh, Free Clinic. l was born in a neighborhood very much like this one. That's why l can't turn my back on it, like a lot of other people have, right? This check for $15,000 will go toward building... - Who we looking for? - l think we found him. See the guy at the mic? That's Philip Madras. - You know him? - Everybody in Detroit knows him. Come on. - As well as... - Excuse me, guys, as well as the proceeds from the sale of the work of these fabulous local artists of yours. Let's give 'em a hand. l'd like to present this check to Mr. Albert... - That's, uh... - Yeah yeah, l know who it is. lt's starting to come together a little bit, isn't it? ...from your new Free Clinic. Step right over here, folks. We're gonna start the groundbreaking. He's a great man, your mayor. Shall we take some pictures? Come on, come on. There they are. This guy Madras, he's a real American success story, boy. He started kinda small, you know, racketeering, extortion. So how does a guy like you get his claws - into a man like Jarryd anyway? - Tony-san, not here. What, are you lending him money, 3% interest per day? - ls that how it starts? - What's the matter with you? You on something? - No, not on something. - No, l'm on something, pal. l'm on your ass. That's what's l'm gonna be on. You're sick, buddy. You're sick. - Get him out. - Officers, l want these men removed. Get 'em out of here. l'm gonna nail your ass! Yeah, l'm gonna nail ya. You're a goddamn murderer. Yeah, yeah, l'm gonna nail your ass. Sayonara. You got it wrapped up in a nice neat package, don't you? Jarryd is tied up with Madras. Scully is the man that killed ''Awshima.'' - Oshima. - Will you just shut up? Scully killed Oshima and shot Mac. Except that Scully's been blown to bits, along with half the city. And you ain't got evidence to back up anything. You had a search warrant? No, l didn't think so. lt's the first time you ain't got anything smart-ass to say. Now, damn it, Costas, l am within one inch of putting your ass in jail, along with your little kamikaze pal out there. Now let me have 'em. The gun's mine. l paid for it myself. l doubt it. We gave it a pretty good shot, partner. lt's a long way to go for nothing. Tony-san, you a good cop and honorable man. - Dingman, get your cuffs on this man. - Yeah. Put him in a holding cell, 'cause he's gonna be our guest until his flight tomorrow. Get him out of my sight. Dingman, show you're a human being. You don't have to cuff the guy. You got nothing to say here, Costas. You're not even in Robbery anymore. Come on, give him a break. lt's not like the guy's gonna try to escape. He's not gonna escape. No way. l got my eye on this little guy. - Come on, move it. - Get out of that, Houdini. Come here. Down here. Excuse me. May l go bathroom? - Weak bladder, huh? - No, full bladder. What kind of physical they give you over there, huh? Not over there. All right, which hand you want? - Right hand. - The hell with you. lt's gonna be the left. Come on. All right, you got a short bat, you step up close to the plate. And hurry up. Banks, can you hear me? Oh, there's too much paperwork! Hey, Tojo, what are you, shy? - Costas, beautiful car. - Hurry up! - What this? - Toyota. No, really? - Yeah. - No, this Corvette. - What took you so long? - Had to take leak. - What year this? - '59. Beautiful. Look, Jarryd and Madras don't have the prototype, right? - Hmm. - And it was at least, what, 36 hours between when Oshima got here and when he got killed. So if we can figure out what he did in the 36 hours, - then l'd know where the prototype is. - Where the prototype is. - What? - l just say that. No, you didn't. You heard me say it and you copied it. - No, l just say it. - No, l said it. Tony-san, please, no time for bicker. - Where we start? - First, we get off the street. First, we get something to eat. No, first we look at the photographs Oshima left behind. Then we get something to eat after we get off street. What else you got? All Japan. All Japanese stuff. Just family pictures. Oh, great, there you go. Hey, that's American quality for you. Tony-san, you must count your blessings. You know, when l was young man, my first job was to make umbrella. Paper and wood umbrella. Yeah, well, those things probably don't work any better than these. Now not our problem. Now made in Taiwan. - Hey, come on. - Tony, how are you? l haven't seen you in a long time. l want you to meet my friend Natsuo. He's from Japan. - Japan! - Detroit native, very beautiful. Take him out there on the dance floor. Oh, yeah, come on. Come on and dance. - No, Tony-san, l don't dance. - Come on, it's fun. Come on, all right! l'll get someone to dance with you. Get up and dance with him. Go on now. Fu, Fu! l think we got a clue. - What? - This picture. lt wasn't taken in Japan. lt was taken in Detroit. See the Michigan license plates in the background? No no no no. No Michigan license plates in Tokyo. Dance not finished yet. - Come on, we gotta go. - Huh? We gotta go. Come on! - Sayonara. - Sayonara. Sayonara, baby. Sayonara. See, this not Japan. Yeah, it's a Michigan license plate, but that doesn't tell us where. Let me see the Pepsi machine. Oh, yes, graffiti. ''Duke''? What mean ''Dukes''? - That's bad news, guys. - lt's a street gang here in Detroit. - Dukes. - Where they stay? They hang out around Woodward and 8 Mile. Somewhere in that area. Oh, getting close. See, Dukes. Recognize doorway in picture. Must hurry. Daybreak come pretty soon. Owner be here. Yeah. And l'll bet you one of your fish heads that prototype is inside here somewhere. Now technically, we're gonna need a warrant to get in this joint. No, no need warrant. Have probable cause. - Probable cause? - Yeah. - You hear baby crying? - l do hear a baby crying. - You smell smoke? - You know, l smell something. Good morning, Detroit. This is Dick Burden with you on a perfect race day. The annual Grand Prix is just getting underway. Sunny skies and beautiful racing weather and by the way, l wanna give a big Motor City welcome to all the racing fans who are in town today. lf you don't have tickets to the race, no problem. We'll have details on how you can win some coming up shortly. - Just keep it right here on... - ." Z95.5. ." He's here. Man, what the hell you talking about? He don't even speak Japanese. Look, we're police officers, okay? We're trying to find out who broke into your building and made a mess here. Now just bear with us. We got a lead on a guy. Have you ever seen this guy before? Yeah yeah yeah. He was here a couple days ago. l don't even know his name and l don't know what he's done, but whatever it is, l don't want any part of it. Look, just tell us everything you know. Yeah, don't leave anything out. The Jap saw him. He knows where the component is. What did he say to you? Did he give you something? Hey, look, who are these guys? These guys aren't cops. - Organized crime-- - Do you ever shut up? He gave it to you, right? He left it here with you. Where is it? Look, l told you, l don't know anything. - l don't even know his name. - You better start talking. Now l promise l won't hurt you if you tell me what you know. - Now talk! - Listen, he was a strange dude. He came in and rented one of my bays to fix his car. - What kind of car? - lt was a Toyota. - The rental! - He put the component in the car. lt was there all the time. l hate this part of the business. Back off! Back off. Your friend's gonna get it. l'm not kidding. Come on. Cover me! Come on! Tony-san, behind us. Hang on! Arrgh! They're going to the car rental. Come on. l got a map here for you just in case you get lost. Nothing fancy now. Just good solid transportation. Thank you. Just one moment, sir. Excuse me. Excuse me.

Go! Get out of here! The other way! The wrong way! No! So tell me, what's going to happen to Mr. Jarryd? Oh, Jarryd? Oh, he's got some kind of immunity, as usual. lf it was Japan he would have to commit suicide to save family honor. Suicide? You do something wrong in America you don't commit suicide. You hire the best lawyers money can buy and then they murder everybody else. Ow! Come on, cheer up. You're going home. l no like go home. Look at me, broken leg. Maybe no career. No prototype, no Oshima. Not true. Oshima's on the same flight you are. Come on. Lighten up. l could get into a lot of trouble for this. You're not gonna get in trouble Look, just go to the house and l'll call you tomorrow. All right? Just go home. Look, a friend of mine works in duty free. l got you a little gift. No, please. l don't want gift. ln America it's an insult not to take a gift. Here. No Japanese home should be without one of these. The prototype. - Arigato - Don't flash it around. Thank you very much, Tony-san. But you, what kind of police officer? You bribe colleague. You break, enter, maybe steal police evidence. You make better crook than cop. Yeah, tell me about it. Tony-san. Thank you very much. But why for you do this? Hey, it's more Japanese junk to me, pal. Japanese junk? Hey, Natsuo. ls this how they do it? No, this how they do it. - See you later, pal. - Sayonara, my friend.
