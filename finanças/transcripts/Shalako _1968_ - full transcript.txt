Excellent shot, countess, excellent. Bravo. - How wonderful you were, Irina. - Bravo, countess. But how terrifying. Wasn't she wonderful, Frederick? - Remarkable. - Thank you. But I could hardly have missed at that distance. It will be a magnificent trophy. Of course we'll have the head. You do look remarkably relieved, Mr. ambassador. Lam. I was beginning to be afraid that my promises of game... Would prove empty. We can't have that, can we? Good man, mako. We shall celebrate the first kill. I must apologize for the temperature, baron... But what can I do in this heat? We'll survive, mako, even if the champagne is a little warm. Give me a hand. Not warm, baron. Merely not sufficiently chilled. We are not finished, are we? I think, my dear, we ought to end the Clay... On a successful note and make camp. You'll find that everything has been prepared, baron. Elena! - Senora... - Rojas. Elena. Don't worry, Henry. I've asked you before... if you must talk to the hired hands... Please confine yourself to English. Well, Henry, please... It's vital that we make a good impression. I would like to raise my glass to the countess. Charming and beautiful... Hits what she aims at... Whoever he is. How beautifully put, Mr. ambassador. Thank you, baron. I don't think I've completely lost the touch. How would you like some of that bubbly stuff, marker? - That's not for me. - Nor me. If you were mine... I'd make you lap that right out of the dust, lady daggett. But I'm not yours, am I, Mr. fulton? No, ma'am. You're his... And is he watching us. I shouldn't let that trouble you. It's quite the best he can do. Frederick, look! Scavengers. Coyotes, countess. Probably following the blood smell. Come on, Frederick. Frederick, go with her! My clear Julia, i didn't come 6,000 miles... To hunt carrion-eaters. But you can't let her ride off alone. Any danger, Mr. fulton? Not from coyotes. Pete! Yeah? Keep your eye on her. Bring her back to the brenner ranch. She's all yours, Pete. Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em! Out of cartridges! You all right? Yes. Brenner ranch. Warn them... Shalako. Why don't you help him? I'm... dead man. - Did you separate? - I had to. It was just for a few minutes. Never go alone here. Not even for modesty's sake. But our hunter, Mr. fulton, said there were no Indians here. Fulton? Bosky fulton? Yes. This is a bigger mess than I thought. All right. Come on, let's go. What about him? He's dead. Won't you at least bury him? Look, I let one of them go, and he'll be back... And he's bringing lots with him. Now come on. How do you know? Because their village is almost 100 miles from here. They wouldn't come this far alone. But why attack us? We are just a hunting party. They'll be doing the hunting. He knew your name. Who did? Mr. Wells. Is that who that was? Are you the countess? I am the countess. Irina lazaar. - They said there was one. - Who said? The army. They want you people out of here. Why? Because you don't belong here. - What? - Shut up. Just relax. Act like a countess. What does that mean? Just don't faint. Come on. Young braves cry revenge! Woman die. Shalako die. They attacked first. They killed the wagon-master. You, woman kill three apaches. It could have been four. I let one go. My father say waste time talk. Tell him this. I came alone and in peace. Woman people brought guns... Broke treaties... Invadeland. But I came alone. And not with the army. You kill me or the hunting party... And the army will come in. Many more of your people will die. And how many this time? My father say what you do? I will have the hunting party on the move by sunup. I will lead them directly off the reservation. That is my promise. Our promise. My father say till sunup. Your father is wise. Shalako. I wish you failure, shalako. Chato, we've fought too much in the past. Yes, we fight. We both live. My spirit live forever... If I kill you before I die. You are supposed to guess how many he ordered... In the first place. Baron, how many do you think he ordered? Seventeen. - Fourteen? - No. Well, I'll be damned. Is anything wrong? No, ma'am. We see sights like this all the time here. Go. Rather charming little wine, mako. - My compliments. - Thank you, baron. How's your charming red-eye, bosky? But we didn't come all this way just to drink a wine... Available at any corner grog shop, did we? Are you dissatisfied with our progress, sir Charles? No. It's simply that I've yet to see... The fabled big horn sheep. There's plenty of them around, right, fulton? Yeah. We'll find some in the morning. Here they come! Shalako! Where's fulton? Well, Irina, I'm afraid we couldn't wait. Frederick, Mr. Wells is dead. Julia, Mrs. Clarke-please help the countess to her wagon. Fulton! I never figured you for the stupe. What are you doing bringing these people... Into this territory? Where's Pete Wells, shalako? He's dead... and three Indians. Ancl you oughta know better. Apaches? - Yeah, chato. Chato? Who's chato? Fulton, give orders to strike camp. Now, wait a minute. Fulton does what we tell him. What I tell him. Ancl we have not been properly introduced, sir. His name's shalako carlin. Ex-army man. You the baron? Frederick hallstatt. And this is my hunting party. Well, baron, if you can get your hunting party... Moving within the hour... - And where would we be going? - Off this reservation. If the Indians are on the rampage... It's up to the army to protect us. You don't seem to understand, mister. Senator. Senator Henry Clarke. Then as a senator, you ought to be aware of the treaty. The army's not allowed in here. But we are an authorized hunting party. You're a pack of whites breaking a treaty. A treaty... With savages? Yeah, we've broken lots of them in the past. But this one I helped make. Now, the army has agreed to meet your party... At the boundary of the reservation... And conduct you to the safety of civilization. Why don't you join us for dinner, sir? Perhaps we can discuss means of dealing with your apaches. Make... Mrs. Clarke, how is the countess? As well as can be expected, baron, after killing an Indian. All by herself? Did you really have to kill one of those savages, Irina? What did it feel like? It's not the same as killing a lion. - But a red Indian. - He was a man. You're trembling. The water is cold. How beautiful. Charles's mother had a necklace like this. Before we were married, she used to say... "My dear, when you and darling Charles are married..." "I want you to have this." I've never had the courage to ask... Whether it went on a bad turn of the cards... Or a poor choice of horses. Wear it if you like. Is it that unimportant to you? Yes. I suppose nothing is important... If it's yours by right. Julia, they were going to kill me. It was foolish of you to ride off alone. None of it would have happened had you stayed with Frederick. He was terribly annoyed. That is hardly important. It is the only important thing. Frederick demands propriety. If you want to please him... Julia, it is one thing to try to arrange a marriage... But another to insist on it. So you see I'm quite certain, Mr. carlin... When you inflict sufficient casualties... Your noble savage will be quite discouraged. Baron, the apache is never discouraged. He's born with an instinct for war. He's never read any textbooks... But there's nothing in saxe or jomini that he doesn't know. You've read them? Yeah. Ancl compared to the guerrilla tactics of the apache... They're a joke. Irina, you look hardly the worse for your experience. After dinner, you must tell us about it. Frederick, when are we leaving? Certainly not during dinner, my clear. Mako, you may serve the ladies. But didn't Mr. carlin explain? Mr. carlin explained the dread details... And I explained that with our far superior fire power... There is really no problem. But there is a problem. Mr. carlin gave his word we would leave. Ancl I gave mine, too. I beg your pardon, countess. I was not laughing at you... Merely at the idea of feeling bound... By a promise to the apaches. I don't think Mr. carlin finds that as amusing as you do. No, I don't. I guess you'd hate like hell to set a precedent. I've no doubt, carlin... That you could make your points without vulgarity. Well, since I am a guest in your country, Mr. carlin... Shall we do it your way? Gentlemen, your votes. Sir Charles? Well, there's simply no question of running away... In the face of threats from savages. We learned by experience in India... That to give way to these natives... Could be a fatal mistake. Senator? Well, of course I've never been a soldier... But I'm quite a hand with a squirrel rifle. I vote we teach them a lesson. Mr. fulton? Ain't run from no Indian yet, baron. Mr. carlin? That's a bad stone bruise, colonel. You won't get far with him. How many guns you got here? There's buffalo, fulton, me... Hockett, marker, Andrews, Johnson. Sixteen, not counting the foreigners. - Rojas! - Yes, colonel? Get buffalo and a couple of others. Fill every barrel and container that'll hold water. Get all the food and ammunition you can find. Bring 'em here. Half up top and half down below here. " Rojas! " Yes, sir? How long do you reckon you could hold out here? I think two... Or maybe three clays. Yes, well, you better saddle me up a good horse. In your condition, colonel? Yeah, you're right. A couple of hours sleep now will make it easier later. But remember... No more than two hours. Sure, colonel. When will they come? The first light of dawn. Mr. carlin, earlier today you were angry... That I separated from Mr. Wells. Yeah. Well, that was a whole other situation, countess. Right now, ahead of me I've got two hours sleep... And a hard day's ride to the border... To convince the army that it's worthwhile coming in here. In all, it should take two to three days. With a bit of luck, you should all still be alive. You need a good horse. Take mahomett. Your Arabian? Yes. I want him safe. You'll have to talk your friends into sleeping up top. It's the only place that can be defended... For a while, that is. Unless the baron wants to form a square out front. You don't like us very much, do you? No. You're trouble. Stone dumb useless trouble. But you... Well, you're too beautiful to die. Would you suggest I abandon my friends and go with you? You could do a lot worse... But I suppose a lady has to live by a code. If she lives. Either of you two gentlemen ever heard of Hannibal... Hamelin of Maine? No. Henry, I'm sure the gentlemen... Are not interested in American politics. Well, they're politicians, ain't they? Trouble with being on safari, baron... No place to chase the ladies... When comes time for Brandy and cigars. Now about Hamilton... Hannibal hamelin of Maine. Absolutely no reason under the sun... Why you should ever have heard of him... But he was Lincoln's vice president... During the war years. The party dropped him for Johnson in '64... And you know what happened to Johnson. Well, now at the time of that convention in '60... I was still a senator. Elena and I had just gotten married. Would you believe it, baron, at that convention in '60... There was a very strong move toward me... For the second position. Pardon. What the hell is happening here? Where's Irina? Don't you realize the whole plan is going up in bloody smoke? And what would you suggest i do about it? Find Irina. Do whatever you have to to get her back with the baron. This was your idea from the start. You said if I arrange the trip, you would make the match. Well, I got the baron to come here... And I arranged for that bloody idiot Clarke! Charles, they'll hear you. Let them hear me. Don't you realize that we haven't enough funds... To get back to england? Ancl even if we did... We'd probably be arrested for debt. You can be arrested for debt, my love. You are my wife. Or do you intend to settle down with that cowboy? Don't be a fool. I'm not quite the fool you think I am. But I'm surprised at you this time, Julia. It's the first time you've really dropped down in class. How you've misread me all these years, Charles. I've always taken what was available. Hit me, and it will all be ruined. Perhaps I'll leave you to the apaches. They apparently have very interesting ways... With ladies. I'd have served the cause a little better... Than Hannibal hamelin of Maine. And father Abe would not have had to look elsewhere... For a new vice president. So there I'd have been in '65 when tragedy struck. Imagine that. Of course... I wasn't even re-elected to the senate in '60. - Henry, I wish... - It's all right, my love. You know that I have never blamed you. If you'll excuse me, i must get ready for bed. Just one moment! Baron, stop them! Colonel carlin gave us orders, baron. Colonel carlin? Carlin! - Carlin! - Here! Are you giving orders in my camp, carlin? No, Frederick. I asked him to help. If the Indians attack tomorrow... We must get supplies into the stable. We are to hunt wild sheep tomorrow. Baron... I figured you for stubborn, but you're something else. You, sir, are one stupid son of a bitch. If you had any breeding, I'd kill you. However, my clear, since you seem truly worried... I see no harm in taking a few simple precautions. I suggest collecting water in all possible containers. Mr. fulton, you'll set the watch. Hans, you'll select the weapons. See that everyone is supplied with cartridges. Yes, baron. I apologize for carlin. You aren't frightened, Irina, are you? - Angry? - No. I understand you, Frederick. I know you would rather die than show weakness. Naturally. And so would you. We are two of a kind. I do believe, Irina, we should be married. Frederick, this is not the time... I'm aware that this is not the proper time... But it would be a very sensible match. Sensible... yes. But do you love me, Frederick? Would that be important, Irina? It's more important now to save our lives. My clear, if we had only you and these rifles... I would believe our lives would be completely secure. Sleep well. No'.! We'll meet again, Mr. carlin. Don't you count on it, baron. Marker... Luther. Buffalo, rojas... Upstairs with me. Get down, ma'am! Hans, stop them! You gotta lead 'em, ma'am, like a flying duck. - Help him. - Yes, ma'am. Rojas! Downstairs! Stay up here. To hell with you. We're gonna help the baron. - We're all gonna be killed! - Keep quiet. Come on, baron, we'll cover you! There are still some of our men out in the wagon. Get the hell out of that wagon! Why don't they attack? Why should they? We're not going anywhere. I'll go downstairs, see who's still alive. Lady daggett, please, we need help. You must hold his legs. No. Lady daggett, do as he asks. Do you want to get killed? We're all going to die. Idiot, idiot. Do you know what they'll do to you? I don't care! Fulton! They're coming over the wall! Get upstairs. Cow ards. Hold it. They're pulling out. Look! That's what's making them pull out. Damn fools are burning up every bullet they've got. Hold your fire! Can't you see they're pulling out? Hockett, Luther. Get the coach horses ready. Clean out that wagon, then burn it. Right. Johnson, saddle the horses. We've driven them off. Driven them off, my butt. It's that smoke talk. Maybe now we can leave for the fort, Frederick. There would seem to be little choice. Rojas, Harris, marker... Collect the remaining horses... And hitch them to the wagon and coach. Mako, you'd better start carrying supplies down. And tell fulton to come up and see me. Hold it! What the hell do you think you're doing, fulton? Marker, take their guns. In there. What about shalako's horse? No good. You can forget about him. Senator. There's really no need for you to carry anything. I'm quite sure there isn't, baron... But right now it seems like the smart thing to do. Put that stuff right in the coach, gentlemen. The baron wants you upstairs, fulton. Yeah. Put that stuff in the coach, mister. Luther, keep your eye on them. Fulton, where are you? I'm busy. I want to take hans' body down. Fulton, you come up now. No, baron. You come down here now. Shoot him, Irina. Move with that, and he gets it right in the gut! Shoot him! Throw it down here. Now bring the others down. Marker, keep your eye on 'em coming down... And take these two guys up and get the supplies. Put it in the coach. Shuck 'em down for whatever's left. Right, boss. Johnson, help marker. Check their rifles. Make sure they're empty. Are you going to leave us here to die, fulton? We're going to leave you. Whether you live or die is up to the apaches. Give me your rings. Yours, too, baron. My family ring... no! Ok. All their rifles are empty. We've got the ammunition. That's it, then. Johnson, you drive the coach. Luther, ride shotgun. Hockett, you and me'll ride the horses. Marker, inside the coach. We got most of the food, fulton... But what about the rest of that water? I'm going with you! Julia! In the coach. For god's sake! If any of you ever get down to Mexico, look me up. Let's get the guns loaded. And dig out the food. - Load the guns? With what? - What food? - Shalako had us hide a reserve. - Under the hay. I'm sorry, baron. That's all the water. The well. Baron, someone's coming! It's shalako! The apaches pulled out just when they had us dead, shalako. - There was smoke! - Yeah, my smoke. - Then fulton high-dealed! - Who went with him? Luther, marker, hockett, and Johnson. - Where are the rest of them? - Dead. Lady daggett went with fulton. He took all the horses except yours. - How is he? - Better, but... Load up the horses. We'll leave now. You'll be walking, so travel light. Do we have a chance? You'll be on foot, so it depends. Now, everybody keep in the coach tracks. If the fort lies in that direction... It seems suicidal that we go that way. That's what I'm hoping chato will think... And he'll lose a couple of hours trying to head us off. That should give us time to reach the plateau. There's water up there... And with the high ground we can hold them off. For a while, that is. He's right, Frederick. Shalako. Buff, rojas, come out here. Keep on the rocks. Get behind the big rock. Inside. That'll have to do. Come on. Stay down. God damn you! There were only six of them. What about those? Freeze! Don't move. We have a couple of hours until dark. Let's use them. Move quietly. All right? My watch? I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep. Sit down. I am so thirsty. Press it to your lips. Does it contain water? Well, something like it. You know a lot about everything, don't you? Enough to survive. Shalako... it's a strange name. Yeah. It means "rain bringer." Zuni Indian. It seems every time I went to that territory, it rained. They could be in for a long dry spell. Ancl what is your real name? Moses zebulan carlin. My mother was partial to reading the Bible. That's just why i stuck to shalako. Ancl where is Mrs. Moses zebulan carlin? - You know I'm not married. - How would I know? Most women have an instinct for that sort of thing. Same way as most men have an instinct... For a woman who's available. I knew a general's wife in Washington... Who could walk into a room... And pick out every bachelor at a glance. How could she tell? Well, she said it was their angle of arrogance. That would apply to Frederick. Yes, he is arrogant. What sort of wife do you think he'll marry? Someone of his own class... Who would give him strong soldier sons. And you? Will you ever marry? You can live without a woman? Only when I have to. Out here, a man just finds a squaw... Washes her down good a couple of times... - I don't want to know. - You did ask. I still don't want to know. Of course... When there's a choice... No. I would like very much for you to make love to me... But it's impossible. No. Out here, nothing's impossible. No. Why? Frederick? You don't understand. It's not for him. It's for me. That would spoil everything... Make it ugly... And I couldn't bear that. What if I just took what I wanted? I would kill you. Well, at least I'd die happy. Well, at least I'd die happy. If there were no hope, there would be no problem. But you have given us hope. Would it help my case any if I told you there was none? You'd be lying, wouldn't you? Unfortunately, yes, but not by much. I think you'd better go back and try to go to sleep. Sometimes I wish i could be more like Julia. She takes what she wants. Come on, bosky, the sun's up. Let's go. We'll take a rest here. That's the plateau. We're almost there. Not quite. That's the back of it. We've got to follow the canyon round. Takes seven or eight hours to do that. Ancl not a drop to drink... Water, I mean. There's plenty up there. Why don't we climb here? Not a chance. Not unless you're a mountain goat. It would be a comparatively simple climb. Now, look, baron... I'm not trying to give you an argument, colonel carlin. I'm merely stating facts. I might know nothing about Indians and frontier tactics... But I do know about mountain climbing. You see, it's a dilettante's sport. Frederick has climbed the south face of the jungfrau. As sir Charles would say, "easy as pie." We have got the ropes. These should be long enough. It's a mere 300 meters. Well, how long would it take? Depending on the slowest member. You would not have to wait for me. I've climbed since i was a child. I reckon he must mean me, ma'am. I don't like to climb no higher than my horse's back. How long? A couple of hours... Maybe a little longer with the supplies. Ancl the Indians would have to go through the canyon. They'd never climb. And we'd save five or six hours, shalako. Why are we waiting? Ok. Unload the supplies and cut the horses loose. All right. I'll lead. Sir Charles... You'll take the last position as anchor man. The men will carry supplies. The ladies, I'm afraid... Does that make sense to you, carlin? This is your party, baron. All right, then we go. What's the matter? I don't know. Well, there ain't nothing up there. I don't see nothing. I'm going to ride on ahead. Do you want to come with me? No, I'm fine. I may join you later. Carlin. All right, now. Watch it. All right? Yeah. Come on, buff. - Hold me! - Hold on! Hold me, shalako! Don't look down. Keep your head up. Hold me, shalako. Ok. Easy, now. I hope that was food. No, damn it to hell, it was bullets! Indians! Apaches! They've caught up with the coach. Forget them. Come on up. No'.! No! Please! Please! Please! Take this. No! No! Carlin? Come on now. All right, buffalo, up you come. Do this for pleasure, eh? As often as possible. All right. Don't take too much at once. Careful. Easy as pie. Yeah, sure. Hate to think of all those cartridges we lost. I ain't goin' back. We have our weapons, we have food. And water. Yeah, and plenty of time. Carlin, look. How much time? They can't get up the canyon until nightfall. And Indians don't attack at night. You're learning fast, baron, but you can never be certain. - We'll post sentries anyway. - Of course. When you've quite finished... All right, daggett, come on. Heavens, I'm thirsty. Don't know who's going to last longer, them or me. Dinner is served, gentlemen. I hope the wine's chilled properly. They have to come across this open space. Yes. They should come this way, but you never can tell. With the others in these forward positions... We'll set up a crossfire... And get daggett to cover the rear. Dinner, sir Charles. No. Thank you very much. Perhaps she got away. She never really cared for me... But I, in my own way... I loved her very much. Well, my love, shall we retire? Of course. I believe we have the royal suite. No, I have the royal suite. You have the presidential suite. Good night, senator. Si, senora. Buenos noches. I'm sorry, Henry. I know you don't like me to speak Spanish... But somehow it's comforting. Buenos noches, senor. Hasta manana. It is a beautiful language. Perhaps you'll teach me someday. Henry, whatever happens tomorrow... We have shared so many good things, haven't we? Thank you, Elena. I'd better check with buff. It's my watch. Good night. - Good night. - Good night, shalako. Strange name, isn't it? Does it mean anything? Some other time, baron. Look, Frederick... Like two lovers on a stroll. You're a romantic, Irina... Something I never suspected in you. I'm not sure i suspected it myself. Well, I had better take up my post. Irina... Even if, I mean... If we were to return to Europe... I would ask you to please forget my proposal of marriage. Frederick, that's... No no, my darling. It would never work. You'd spend the rest of your days hating me... For being so stupidly stubborn. How could I hate you for doing what you think right? You are very generous. Perhaps I should say... I'd never stop hating myself. Buff. Yeah, shalako. Come on in. - All right? - Yeah. They're down there, all right, but they're a long way off. What do you reckon they're doin' down there, shalako? Wondering what we're doing up here. Sure is a lot of them. Take over. How many times did you say? What? Wash her down a couple of times. Isn't that what you said? Yes. Well... Last night, you wanted me. Do you want me now? Yes. Here they come, shalako! Shalako. It's fulton. I'm coming in. Keep in your positions, all of you. Ok, fulton, come in. Why'd you come up here? I had a choice... Cross the desert on foot without water... Come up here with you... Or the Indians. I thought you'd be glad to see another gun. How'd you know we were up here? How'd you know we were up here? I ran into the Indians. It figured. Fulton! Where's Julia? They're dead... all dead. You murdering bastard! Daggett, you get back to your post. Fulton, I want you right there. Where I get killed first? That's right, and where I can watch you. Mako, give him some cartridges. Shalako! Hold your fire. They're pulling back. Shalako, they're pulling back... And the fight hasn't even started yet. I don't like it. I'll go down and take a look. Give me some cover. Did you see me, countess? I got three. - Good man, mako. - Yes, I think so. Sir Charles, I got... Sir Charles! Fulton! Elena, Irina, get some water, please. At last... I've managed to get something right. - What the hell happened? - They're both dead. Mako, take daggett's position. Rojas, pull back. How? Nobody shoot. Shalako, we fight. No'.! I'll be happy when I die, shalako. Shalako! No kill chato. No more blood shed. - You go. - Kill me, shalako! You have killed me. Colonel, they left us horses. Yeah. Rojas, prepare to bury the dead. Shalako. Shalako. He rode wild country down new Mexico. Borne on the wind to follow the sun. Fought death with a knife. Would gamble his life to hold a woman. Love came to shalako. Shalako. She called his name and wanted shalako. Biding his time and planning to win. He loved for a Clay, then traveled his way. Ancl the lady followed him. The one called shalako. Shalako. Shalako
