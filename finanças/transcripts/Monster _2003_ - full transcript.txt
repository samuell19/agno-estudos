Woman's voice: I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN THE MOVIES. WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I THOUGHT FOR SURE, ONE DAY, I COULD BE A BIG, BIG STAR. OR MAYBE JUST BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL AND RICH, LIKE THE WOMEN ON TV. YEAH, I HAD A LOT OF DREAMS, AND I GUESS YOU COULD CALL ME A REAL ROMANTIC BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVED THAT ONE DAY THEY'D COME TRUE. SO I DREAMED ABOUT IT FOR HOURS. AS THE YEARS WENT BY, I LEARNED TO STOP SHARING THIS WITH PEOPLE. THEY SAID I WAS DREAMING. BUT BACK THEN, I BELIEVED IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY. SO WHENEVER I WAS DOWN, I WOULD JUST ESCAPE INTO MY MIND, INTO MY OTHER LIFE, WHERE I WAS SOMEONE ELSE. IT MADE ME HAPPY TO THINK THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T KNOW YET WHO I WAS GOING TO BE. BUT ONE DAY, THEY'D ALL SEE. I HEARD THAT MARILYN MONROE WAS DISCOVERED IN A SODA SHOP AND I THOUGHT FOR SURE IT COULD BE LIKE THAT, SO I STARTED GOING OUT REAL YOUNG AND I WAS ALWAYS SECRETLY LOOKING FOR WHO WAS GONNA DISCOVER ME. WAS IT THIS GUY? OR MAYBE THIS ONE? YOU NEVER KNEW. BUT EVEN IF THEY COULDN'T TAKE ME ALL THE WAY LIKE MARILYN, THEY WOULD SOMEHOW BELIEVE IN ME JUST ENOUGH. THEY WOULD SEE ME FOR WHAT I COULD BE AND THINK I WAS BEAUTIFUL... LIKE A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH. THEY WOULD TAKE ME AWAY TO MY NEW LIFE AND MY NEW WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING WOULD BE DIFFERENT. YEAH... I LIVED THAT WAY FOR A LONG, LONG TIME... IN MY HEAD, DREAMING LIKE THAT. IT WAS NICE. BUT ONE DAY, IT JUST STOPPED. BY THE TIME I MET SELBY WALL, SHIT, ALL I WANTED WAS A BEER. THEN I LOOKED DOWN, AND I'M BUSTING RIGHT OUT OF MY TOP. I'M GONNA FIND MY OWN SEAT. OKAY. - HOW YOU DOING? - GOOD. - ANYONE SITTING HERE? - NO. FOUND MY SEAT. Woman: WHO-HO-HOA! LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRUG IN. SHE'S RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY. MAN, YOU GOT A TOWEL? MA'AM, OUR SERVICES ARE FOR PATRONS ONLY. GIVE ME A BEER... WHATEVER'S CHEAPEST. SO, WHAT IS THIS, LIKE A GAY PLACE OR WHAT? YEAH. HEY, WHATEVER, MAN. - HEY! - HI. HEY! - CAN I... CAN I BUY YOU THAT DRINK? - I GOT MY OWN MONEY. OH. I'LL HAVE A PITCHER... WHATEVER SHE'S HAVING. LOOK IT, I'M NOT GAY, ALL RIGHT? OH, OH, THAT MAKES SENSE. SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE THEN? MY TRUCK BROKE DOWN. I'M... I GOT A PRESSURE CLEANING BUSINESS. WHAT'S PRESSURE CLEANING? YOU KNOW, STEAM CLEAN, UPHOLSTERY, CARPETS... YOU KNOW, SHIT LIKE THAT. SO I'M JUST GETTING OUT OF THE RAIN. MY NAME'S SELBY. LEE. YOU OWE ME CHANGE. FUCK. I'M OUTTA HERE. - ARE YOU SURE? - GET YOUR FUCKIN' HANDS OFF ME, YOU DUMB DYKE! I'M NOT GONNA FUCK YOU FOR FUCKIN' BEER, OKAY? STOP WASTIN' YOUR FUCKIN' TIME! I WASN'T TRYING TO FUCK YOU! I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU, AND I THOUGHT IF I BOUGHT YOU SOME BEER MAYBE YOU'D TALK TO ME. I'M JUST TRYING TO HAVE ONE DECENT NIGHT OUT. YOU KNOW, JUST TALK TO SOMEONE BEFORE I HAVE TO GO BACK TO MY PARENTS' CLOSET. I... I'M SORRY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY. IT'S NO SKIN OFF MY FUCKIN' NOSE, OKAY? I'M JUST TRYING TO BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU. SO, ARE YOU REALLY A STEAM CLEANER? - NO, I'M NOT. - THAT'S GOOD. THAT SOUNDS REAL BORING. NO, MAN, ACTUALLY IT'S A REAL GOOD JOB, PRESSURE CLEANING. YOU... YOU WANT SOME? Lee: YOU'RE NOT GONNA WUSS OUT ON ME NOW. ONE FOR YOU, ONE FOR ME. - LUCKY NUMBER 10, OKAY? - OH, NO. OH, COME ON, DON'T LET ME DOWN NOW. YOU READY? - ONE, T... - ONE, TWO...

Lee's voice: ALL I WANTED WAS A BEER, BUT THE DAY I MET SELBY I'D SPENT MOST OF THE AFTERNOON SITTING IN THE RAIN, ABOUT TO KILL MYSELF. SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND... I WAS FLEXIBLE. I MEAN, EVERYBODY'S GOTTA HAVE FAITH IN SOMETHING. FOR ME? FOR ME ALL I HAD LEFT WAS LOVE. AND I WAS GETTING PRETTY SURE I WAS NEVER GONNA LOVE A MAN AGAIN, SO I WAS GONNA DO IT. AND THE ONLY REASON I DIDN'T WAS A $5 BILL. I KNEW I'D PROBABLY GIVEN SOME ASSHOLE A BLOWJOB FOR IT, SO IT REALLY STARTED TO PISS ME OFF THAT IF I KILLED MYSELF WITHOUT SPENDING IT, WELL THEN, I BASICALLY SUCKED HIM OFF FOR FREE. SO I MADE A DEAL. I SAID, "GOD, I'VE GOTTA SPEND THIS FIVE BUCKS, BUT WHEN IT'S GONE, SO AM I. SO, IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR ME IN THIS LIFE, YOU BETTER BRING IT ON." AND THERE SHE WAS. OH, JUST SOME FRIENDS OF MY PARENTS THAT I WAS STAYING WITH FOR A LITTLE BIT. DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A SHOWER OR ANYTHING? YEAH. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. SORRY, I... I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE.

'CAUSE I REMEMBER I'D JUST PUT THE BABY UP FOR ADOPTION. THEY CALLED AN ASSEMBLY AT MY JUNIOR HIGH 'CAUSE THIS GUY WHO PLAYED DRUMS FOR SLIM WHITMAN WAS COMING TO TALK TO US ABOUT SUCCESS AND MAKING YOUR MARK ON THE WORLD.

IT'S HARD, BUT IT'S ALSO STRANGE HOW THINGS CAN BE SO DIFFERENT THAN YOU THINK. I REMEMBER I WAS JUST A KID AND THE 4-H CLUB SET UP THIS BEAUTIFUL GIGANTIC RED AND YELLOW FERRIS WHEEL THAT LIT UP THE NIGHT SKY. THEY CALLED IT... "THE MONSTER." YOU WANTED SOME MONEY? OH. OH MY GOD, ARE YOU SERIOUS? Lee's voice: AS A KID, I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT THE COOLEST THING I'D EVER SEEN, AND I COULDN'T WAIT TO RIDE IT. SURE ENOUGH, WHEN I FINALLY GOT MY CHANCE, I GOT SO SCARED AND NAUSEOUS I THREW UP ALL OVER MYSELF BEFORE IT EVEN MADE ONE FULL TURN. I'M GONNA WASH UP, 'KAY?

AND THE THING NO ONE EVER REALIZED ABOUT ME, OR BELIEVED, WAS THAT I COULD LEARN. I COULD TRAIN MYSELF INTO ANYTHING. PEOPLE ALWAYS LOOK DOWN THEIR NOSES AT HOOKERS. NEVER GIVE YOU A CHANCE 'CAUSE THEY THINK YOU TOOK THE EASY WAY OUT. BUT NO ONE COULD IMAGINE THE WILLPOWER IT TOOK TO DO WHAT WE DO... WALKING THE STREETS, NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, TAKING THE HITS AND STILL GETTING BACK UP. Selby: WE WANNA GO AGAIN. BUT I DID, AND THEY'D ALL MISS OUT, 'CAUSE THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT I COULD DISCIPLINE MYSELF TO, WHEN I BELIEVED IN SOMETHING. AND I BELIEVED IN HER. - I NEED TO SIT DOWN. - OH, THERE SHE IS. - Friend: OH, SHOOT. - I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HER. - HEY, YOU WANNA RIDE THE FERRIS WHEEL? - NO. WE'RE GONNA GO SIT DOWN. OH. YOU OKAY? Selby: WHY'D YOU LEAVE SO YOUNG? MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS SCREWED ME ROYAL. 'CAUSE AFTER MY DAD HAD KILLED HIMSELF WE WERE OUT ON THE STREETS, AND THE NEIGHBORS WOULD LET THEM STAY OVER BUT ONLY IF I DIDN'T TAG ALONG, SO I STEERED CLEAR. BUT I KNEW THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY, YOU KNOW? I WAS HAVING TO HOOK ANYWAY, SO I JUST ALWAYS MADE SURE THEY HAD NEW CLOTHES AND CIGARETTES AND STUFF LIKE THAT. BUT THEN THIS ONE NIGHT WE'RE AT THIS PARTY AND THIS GUY COMES IN AND HE'S LIKE, "YEAH, YOU KNOW, SHE FUCKED SO-AND-SO." AND THEY'RE ALL EMBARRASSED. THEY'RE FUCKING STANDING IN THE CORNER ALL... SO THEY... YEAH, THEY THREW ME OUT IN THE SNOW... SCREAMING OUT, YOU KNOW, I'M A WHORE, AND THEY'RE SO EMBARRASSED AND THEY HATE ME AND ALL THAT. SO THAT WAS IT. I JUST TOOK OFF AND NEVER WENT BACK. THAT'S REALLY SAD. YOU KNOW, YOUR OWN FAMILY DOING THAT TO YOU. YEAH, BUT THAT'S HOW PEOPLE ARE, SELBY. YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW. FUCK 'EM. WHO NEEDS 'EM? RIGHT. YEAH. YEAH, FUCK 'EM. NO, RIGHT.

HER DAD'S JUST AROUND THE CORNER. GET THE FUCK IN THE CAR. WE'RE JUST GONNA TRY AND DRIVE HER OUT, YOU KNOW? IT'S GONNA... IT'S GONNA SAVE US A BUNDLE. MOTHERFUCKER! YOU KNOW, SHE'S GOOD. ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU HAVE YOURSELF A GOOD DAY NOW, OKAY? LET'S GO, SELBY, NOW! NO! NO, I WANT TO DRIVE. SELBY, THAT CAR BELONGS TO A DEAD MAN, ALL RIGHT? HE'S FUCKING DEAD. LET'S GO NOW! - NO! - SELBY! LEE, WHO KILLED THAT MAN? WHO DO YOU THINK? OH MY GOD! THEY'RE COMING FOR US. THEY'RE NOT COMING. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU'RE FUCKING KILLING PEOPLE! KEEP YOUR FUCKING VOICE DOWN! NOW LISTEN TO ME. THEY'RE NOT COMING, ALL RIGHT? I NEVER WANTED YOU IN THIS SHIT TO BEGIN WITH. BUT I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, AND YOU'RE NEVER GONNA UNDERSTAND IT, ALL RIGHT, SO YOU GOT TO TRUST ME. LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT IT... LOOK IT. THEY DON'T HAVE ONE FUCKING THING. THEY GOT NOTHING. THEY'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING, MAN. THIS SHIT IS LONG OVER ALREADY. I DIDN'T WANT TO FUCKING WRECK THE CAR IN PUBLIC, BUT WE DID, YOU KNOW? WE DID, SO IF THEY WERE GONNA CALL THE COPS, THEY WOULDA DONE IT BY NOW. HOW COULD YOU? YOU KNEW. NO. NO. NO, I KNEW ABOUT ONE, LEE, ONE. NO, SELBY. NO, SELBY. FUCK IT. COME IN HERE. WE'LL HAVE A DRINK, AND WE'LL FORGET ABOUT ALL THIS, ALL RIGHT? CHEERS. LEE, THIS ISN'T FUNNY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, SEL. I DO. SO IF YOU WANNA KEEP YOUR EYES SHUT TO THE WHOLE WORLD, THEN THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS HEAR ME OUT. NOW... IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS, ALL RIGHT? - I KNOW WHAT IT IS. - NO, YOU DON'T KNOW MY LIFE, SELBY. BUT I KNOW YOURS. AND I'VE DONE EVERYTHING IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD HOPING THAT YOU'D NEVER HAVE TO KNOW. SO... SO YOU COULD GO ON THINKING THAT PEOPLE ARE GOOD AND KIND, AND THAT SHIT MAKES SENSE, YOU KNOW? 'CAUSE I LOVE THAT ABOUT YOU, SEL. BUT I CAN'T. NO, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS, LEE. I KNOW, BUT YOU NEED TO. WE CAN BE AS DIFFERENT AS WE WANNA BE, BUT YOU CAN'T KILL PEOPLE. SAYS WHO?! I'M GOOD WITH THE LORD. I'M FINE WITH HIM. AND... AND I KNOW HOW YOU WERE RAISED, ALL RIGHT? AND I KNOW HOW PEOPLE FUCKING THINK OUT THERE, AND FUCK, IT'S GOTTA BE THAT WAY. THEY GOTTA TELL YOU THAT "THOU SHALL NOT KILL" SHIT AND ALL OF THAT. BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS, SELBY, 'CAUSE I'M OUT THERE EVERY FUCKING DAY, LIVING IT. WHO THE FUCK KNOWS WHAT GOD WANTS? PEOPLE KILL EACH OTHER EVERY DAY. AND FOR WHAT, HMM? FOR POLITICS, FOR RELIGION. AND THEY'RE HEROES? NO! NO, THERE'S A LOT OF SHIT I CAN'T DO ANYMORE, BUT KILLING'S NOT ONE OF THEM, AND LETTING THOSE FUCKING BASTARDS OUT THERE GO AND RAPE SOMEBODY ELSE ISN'T EITHER. NO, LEE, THAT WAS ONE MAN. THEY CAN'T ALL HAVE BEEN BAD. YOU KNOW ME. YOU THINK I COULD DO IT OTHERWISE? I'M NOT A BAD PERSON. I'M A REAL GOOD PERSON, ALL RIGHT? SO, DON'T FEEL BAD. IT'S LIFE, SEL. PEOPLE LIKE ME AND YOU GO DOWN EVERY FUCKING DAY. BUT NOT US, ALL RIGHT? HEY, IT'S ALMOST OVER. I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS. SEE THIS? THIS IS EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED. JUST A LITTLE MORE AND A CAR AND WE'RE OUT OF HERE. WE HAVE A SHOT, SEL. WE HAVE A SHOT AT A REAL LIFE. NOT THIS, A REAL ONE. - SO, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, RIGHT? - MM-HMM. LEAVE THIS SHIT, MAN. WE DON'T NEED IT, OKAY? - SEE YOU LATER. - OKAY. Selby: SO EVERYTHING'S WORKING OUT AND WE'RE REAL HAPPY. BUT I JUST THOUGHT YOU COULD TELL MY FAMILY 'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE RELOCATING FOR A LITTLE BIT. SO, YOU'RE CHOOSING TO GO THIS WAY? NO, I... THIS IS NOT A CHOICE. I'M NOT CHOOSING ANYTHING. THIS IS JUST... THIS IS THE WAY I AM, AND I'M NOT GONNA FEEL BAD ABOUT IT ANYMORE. YOU CAN TELL HIM THAT TOO. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALL ROMANTIC ABOUT THAT GIRL, BUT WHETHER SHE SUPPORTS YOU OR NOT, SHE'S ALL SCREWED UP AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE THAT FOR A REASON. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT BEING BORN A NIGGER. I'M NOT TALKING... - DONNA, DON'T SAY NIGGER! - WHAT? I'M SAYING IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT. BLACKS OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM, SELBY. YOU KNOW I'M NOT A RACIST. THE POINT IS, PEOPLE MAKE BAD CHOICES. YOU KNOW? AND THEY PAY FOR 'EM, AS YOU CAN SEE, ALL THESE MISERABLE STREET PEOPLE. AND WE SEE YOU CHOOSING THIS LIFE, THIS GAY LIFE. YOU KNOW, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT, THE EASY LIFE WITH THIS WOMAN... NO. NO, NO, SHE'S HAD A REAL HARD LIFE. OH, HONEY, LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE BAD LIVES AND THEY STILL CHOOSE TO MOVE TOWARDS THE LIGHT, OTHERWISE WE'D ALL BE HOOKERS AND DRUGGIES 'CAUSE SOMEBODY YELLED AT US OR WE HAD A MEAN MOM. I DON'T WANNA HEAR THIS. THIS... THIS IS NOT THE POINT. OKAY, BUT DON'T FIGHT THE WORLD, HONEY. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST LOVE OUT THERE, AND... WELL, SOMEDAY, ALL YOU'RE GONNA WANT IS A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD, EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE TO SLEEP WITH A MAN TO GET IT. AND THAT'S YOUR CHOICE. YEAH... YEAH, THIS IS MY CHOICE, 'CAUSE WE'RE IN LOVE. ARE WE GOING ON A HIKE? NO, MAN, THIS IS GOOD RIGHT HERE. WELL, THE CAR WAS GOOD. NOT WHEN THERE'S A FUCKING GUN IN IT. SO? LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE GUNS. WELL, ARE YOU GONNA UNDRESS, OR WHAT? NO, YOU FIRST. YOU THINK I FUCKING TRUST YOU NOW? SO, YOU'RE MARRIED, RIGHT? SEE, I DON'T GET THAT FUCKING SHIT. WANT TO COME OUT HERE WITH STRANGE GIRLS, DO DIRTY THINGS WITH THEM, INSTEAD OF JUST FUCKING YOUR WIFE. WHY, MAN, SO YOU CAN RAPE 'EM? NO. GOOD LORD.

YEAH, THIS OLD GUY USED TO RAPE ME WHEN I WAS EIGHT... REAL GOOD FRIEND OF MY DAD'S, YOU KNOW? SO I GO TO MY DAD, TELL HIM WHAT'S GOING ON, MY DAD DON'T FUCKING BELIEVE ME, SO HIS FRIEND KEEPS RAPING ME FOR YEARS, AND THE FUCKING KICKER TO THE STORY IS THAT MY DAD FUCKING BEATS ME UP FOR IT. YOU SEE? MAN, WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING, HUH? LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA... - LOOK, I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU... - AWW! BUT IF YOU WANT A RIDE, YOU'D BETTER COME ON.

Police urge anyone with information about these crimes to contact your local authorities. Throughout parts of the state. Female reporter: The assailant could be a woman?
