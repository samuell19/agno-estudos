I just want to be able to go out and have a nice night for once. Is that too much to ask? One thing I fuck up in the last nine years. - One thing? - Eight years in a row... It's literally the most important things you have to remember in a relationship. That's not the right way to use "literally". Uh, I know the difference between literal and figurative language, Dave! You get something on me and never let it go. Come on! I knew it was your birthday! 'Cause you saw it on Facebook! That's how most people remember birthdays! I just want a little bit of respect, Dave. Why does everything have to be an argument? - Why do you think?! - You're the one raising your voice! 'Cause it's the only way I can be heard! - You're like a child! - I'm like a child? Yeah, you're like a child! You're the one shouting at me! You started shouting first! ‐ I knew this was coming. ‐ Not one present! ‐ There's a version of this‐‐ there's a version of this where we've had a really lovely time together. ‐ Just buy me a fucking present. Maybe that would be a nice thing to do. - ‐ Just because Stevie cooks one meal... - Yeah? ...doesn't mean suddenly we all have to know how to wash rice! ‐ What are you fucking talking about, Dave?! I'm talking about it's a different thing! ‐ Oh, my God! It's about being a fucking grown‐up! ‐ I am being a grown‐up! Have a look! Just get what I asked you! ‐...and pumpkin activated... ‐ Just get what I asked you! ‐...fucking quinoa‐stuffed... ‐ Not that one! I need this one! It's pumpkin and red lentil! I just want to take you home with me. Yes, I do. Listen! Dave! Fucking listen to me! No! I said no. No! ‐ No! Listen. Calm down! Calm down! Listen! ‐ Mate, move on. Move on. Mate, you've got to move on. Come on. Get a move on. ‐ Pack it up, get out of here. ‐ What are you doing? ‐ I make an effort every day! ‐ Dave... You don't even... ‐ I'm making an effort right now being here! I'll get you something next week! ‐ You don't! You fucking don't, Dave! ‐ Get yourself a present, wrap it up from me! See if I care! ‐ Oh, my God! Well, gosh, gee, golly‐o! I do love a good song, Frogsie! I love singing so much, Teddy! And I love singing with you, Frogsie! ‐ Mommy says you're staying with us. How long will you be here? ‐ Go to school, Felix. ‐ I've been to school. ‐ What time is it? ‐ It's Teddy McGiggle time. ‐ Mc... What?! Where's your mom? ‐ At the shops. If you're staying, does that mean we can hang out lots? ‐ No. Make me a coffee. ‐ I can't make coffee. I'm five. Do you want to play with my toy tractor? ‐ No. Look, Uncle David hit Mommy's booze cabinet pretty hard. Ohh, fuck! ‐ That's a bad word, Uncle David. The McGiggle dance! A‐one, two, three, go! We're coming down under, kiddlywinks! ‐ What's this, Uncle David? Pew, pew! Pew! Pew! ‐ Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew, pew! Pew, pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew, pew, pew, pew! Pew, pew! ‐ What do you think you're doing? Relax. He's really good at it. Whoa! What are you doing?! You're not meant to turn it off like that! You'll damage the hardware! ‐ Don't expose him to that sort of violence. ‐ It's not real! ‐ That's not the point. He's five. What's wrong with you? Come and help me unpack the shopping, fluffy duck. We're having pizza for dinner. ‐ Pizza? Thank fuck! I'm starving! Oh, fuck off! Could someone tell me what the fuck that is meant to be? Dave! ‐ Mommy, he did it again. ‐ I will kick you out. I don't care what you're going through. ‐ What is that? ‐ Tofu. ‐ And this? ‐ It's broccoli. It's a kind of vegetable. ‐ You like eating this? ‐ Yes. And so does my tractor. ‐ Where's the cheese? ‐ I can't have cheese. ‐ You know he can't have dairy. He's anaphylactic. ‐ I'm allergic to fish, dairy, eggs, sesame, nuts, and gluten. ‐ No one's allergic to gluten. It's a fad. ‐ Don't joke, Dave. It's a life‐threatening condition. ‐ So is what I'm going through. ‐ Oh, Boo‐Boo! ‐ Why did you call him Boo‐Boo? ‐ It's what I used to call your uncle when he was your age. ‐ Boo‐Boo! ‐ No, see, you don't get to call me that. You call me Uncle David, Uncle Dave, D‐Man, or Big D. I had too much stuff going on with the band, all right? I couldn't get tied down. ‐ Miss Caroline plays the ukulele and we all sing Taylor Swift songs. Well, you be sure to tell Miss Caroline that she can go and suck a bag of dicks. Dave! ‐ Teddy McGiggle says to sing the bad word song when you hear a grown‐up say a bad word. Do you want to hear it? ‐ No. ‐ ♪ Bad word, bad word! 'Cause you said a bad thing ♪ ♪ Now we all have to sing ♪ ♪ Tra‐la‐la‐la‐la‐la‐la ♪ ♪ Tra‐la‐la‐la‐la‐la‐la... ♪ ‐ All Sara would ever go on about was having kids, okay? That's why we fought all the time. ‐ Dave, there are plenty of things to be scared of in this world, but having a kid isn't one of them. ‐ I came out of a test tube. ‐ Yeah, I know you did, Felix. ‐ Dave, there is nothing that says you have to end up like Dad. ‐ Felix, could you please tell your mom that I'm now gonna go down to Domino's and get myself a proper cheese‐covered pizza, with a side of gluten? ‐ Mommy, Uncle David‐‐ ‐ You don't have to say it, Felix. Your uncle isn't making good choices right now. ‐ You know, when you get yourself a pair of big‐boy pants, you realize there's more to life than tractors! - Fuckin' tractors! - ‐ ‐ Uncle David is so serious, isn't he, Mommy? ‐ Yes, my little fluffy duck. He is. ‐ Quack. ‐ So, do you remember where we're up to? ‐ Where they got away from the witches. ‐ That's right. They're in Norway, and they're safe at Grandma's house. "She was wearing a lace dress "and the lace kept tickling my nose. "I had to rest my head on my front paws. "'Have you ever heard my heart humming away, Grandmama?' "I asked her. "'Often, ' she said. "'I hear it when you're lying very close to me "'on the pillow at night.' "The two of us remained silent in front of the fire "for a long time after that, "thinking about these wonderful things. "'My darling, ' she said at last, are you sure you don't mind "'being a mouse for the rest of your life?' "'I don't mind at all, ' I said. "'It doesn't matter who you are or what you look like, 'as long as somebody loves you.'" - ‐ Felix, get up! Felix! - ‐ ‐ Get up! I need your help. So, when you see her, you breathe as Darth Vader and then you say... "Hello, Aunty Sara. I am Darth Vader. May the Force be with us." ‐ Do it properly, Felix. When the mask is on, you remain in character. "Hello, Aunty Sara. I am Darth Vader. May the Force be with us." ‐ Yeah! Daniel Day‐Lewis just came everywhere in his pants! Okay. Now, can you hold up the sign? I'll come in and take care of the rest. ‐ Yes, Uncle David. I mean... ...yes, Uncle David. ‐ All right. Do it, Darth. What...? Aunty Sara. ‐ Felix?! ‐ I am Darth Vader. ‐ Felix, what are you doing here? ‐ What? No! What the fuck are you doing?! ‐ I live here! ‐ Yeah, well... who the fuck is that?! ‐ Rory. ‐ That's Rory from work. ‐ Well, do me a favor and get Rory from work out of your vagina! ‐ Don't go anywhere, Rory. ‐ Is this Dave? ‐ Yeah, hi, Rory. I'm Dave. I'm Sara's boyfriend of nine fucking years. ‐ Can you watch your language around the kid, please? I am not a kid. I am Darth Vader. May the Force be with us. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you fucked up, didn't you, Sara? Because I was gonna marry you. I was possibly gonna give you a baby. I even made this engagement ring out of a pipe‐cleaner I found under Felix's bed. ‐ No, you do this. You say one thing. You never come through. ‐ Hello? I was just about to! ‐ I don't mean marriage and a baby, Dave! I needed you to love me. And you're incapable of loving anyone but yourself. ‐ At least I'm not stuffing real estate agent dick in me the first chance I get! That's enough. ‐ Oh, what are you gonna do?! ‐ You need to watch your language! ‐ You need to stop having sex in front of kids! ‐ Don't talk to Rory like that. Rory is more in touch with his emotional self than you'll ever be. ‐ The only thing Rory is in touch with is your slutty vagina! ‐ Not cool. ‐ Yeah? "Not cool" this, motherfuck... Arggh! Jesus! Arggh! Arggh! - Oh, God! Fuck! - That's it. - Calm down! - Yuck! Your dick's on my arm! Your sweaty dick! - It's disrespectful! - Shit! No, shit! Okay! - Come on, easy, buddy! - Are you gonna behave yourself? - There's a kid here, man! Ohh! - Are we good now? - Yes? - Arggh! Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry I had to resort to violence. Fucking Rory! ‐ Violence is never the answer. If you only knew the power of the Dark Side. Fucking... I gave you the best years of my life! You saw how much bush was thrown at me when I was in a band. ‐ That was 10 years ago! Stop going on about the band. It's pathetic. ‐ Yeah, well, I never screwed anyone else. I chose to be with you. ‐ There is a big difference between being with someone and being there for someone, Dave. Mmm. ‐ I hope you grow up enough one day to realize that. ‐ I don't need to do that! You do! Fucking idiots! Don't ever expect to see me back here again! - Felix? - I am not Felix. I am Darth Vader. Darth Vader, now! Oh, I don't know. Mommy! ‐ I've been trying to call you. Where the hell have you been? Uncle David took me to see Aunty Sara. ‐ Yeah, and guess what Aunty Sara was doing when we got there? Having sex with a real estate agent. ‐ Hang on. What? ‐ Yeah, I know! ‐ You woke my son up so he could go see two people having sex? ‐ No, not specifically. ‐ The naked man punched Uncle Dave on the nose 'cause Aunty Sara has a slutty vagina. ‐ I don't believe this. ‐ I know. It's unbelievable! I mean, how could she do this to me? ‐ If you can't understand how incredibly inappropriate it is to take your nephew out in the middle of the night, then you can find somewhere else to stay. ‐ What are you talking about? He had a great time! Look, he's Darth Vader! ‐ I am your father, Mommy. ‐ See? He's really good at it. ‐ It's late. I have a double shift tomorrow. Get out of my house. ‐ What, are you crying now? ‐ Mommy, you said it's good to cry. ‐ Why can't Uncle David stay on the couch? ‐ Look, if you're gonna stay here, then you have to start contributing. ‐ Yeah. ‐ Just... put him to bed now. And you can take him to school tomorrow. ‐ Can we play the shooty game, Uncle David? ‐ I don't want us to get in trouble, Felix. We'll have to play it with the sound off. I need to get to class early for Miss Caroline. It's my turn to feed Neville. ‐ Is Neville special‐needs? ‐ Neville's the class guinea pig. ‐ Hey, Felix! What's for lunch today? ‐ That's Max and Ashton. They think I'm not strong because of what Mommy packs me for food. ‐ What fucking douchebags! Max looks like he could use a few more tofu pizzas. Max was the fat one, yeah? ‐ What's a douchebag? ‐ It's a small bag chicks use to irrigate their vaginas. ‐ I hope you've got yummy broccoli today, Felix! ‐ Was that retarded kid using irony to make fun of you? ‐ Mickey has spina bifida. You love broccoli! You love broccoli! ‐ Hi, Felix! ‐ Come on, this way! ‐ Okay! ‐ Felix! Look at you slaying puss in the playground, huh? ‐ Beth is my girlfriend. - ‐ Yeah, dog! - ‐ Treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen. Good morning, Vivienne. Fuck me! Who is that? ‐ Yes! And... yes! Nice! ‐ That's Miss Caroline. ‐ Jesus! ‐ Felix. Lucky last. ‐ Sorry, Miss Caroline. I can still feed Neville. - ‐ Max has already fed him. - Aww! Ooh! Jeez. Neville will be lucky to have anything left with that kid around. ‐ Uh... quickly, put your bags on your hook and unpack crunch‐and‐sip. Come on, mate. I'll give you a hand with that. Come on. ‐ Hey, hey. Thank you. ‐ I'm Dave. I'm Felix's uncle. ‐ Oh. Audrey. Oh! Oh. ‐ Oh, Miss Caroline, jeez. You are just a beacon of positivity in my little nephew's life. ‐ ‐ He talks about you all the time. Apparently you slay Tay‐Tay on the ukulay‐lay? ‐ Oh! I don't know about that. ‐ His mom's going through a weird breakdowny thing at the moment. ‐ Oh, no. Really? ‐ Yeah. It's bad. ‐ I had no idea. ‐ Yeah. ‐ I hope Tess is okay. ‐ Well, thankfully for everyone, Uncle David is here to help. ‐ Oh, dear. He's asleep. Yeah, I mean, what's going on with his mom might be affecting his rhythms. ‐ Don't worry. I'll give him some special attention today. ‐ Lucky boy. Felix doesn't even have a dad! What a loser! ‐ You know, I don't really think of him as a nephew. I think of him as a friend. My best friend. I love kids. ‐ ‐ Ooh! What's wrong? ‐ What happened? ‐ Someone hit me with the door! ‐ Let me see. Let me see. ‐ Oh, no! ‐ You are fine. Okay, quickly, sit back down, so we can get started. ‐ ‐ Brave little man, isn't he? ‐ Nice to meet you, David. ‐ It is. It's so nice to meet you, yeah. Guess I'll see you later. ‐ Yeah. Mm‐hm. ‐ See you, Felix. Love you, mate. - Felix! - ‐ ‐ Love you, matey. See you. Bye. Have fun. ‐ One, two, three! Eyes on me! One, two! Eyes on you! ‐ Okay.

I had this crazy rehearsal. ‐ I'm afraid he had a really rough day today. ‐ Who did? ‐ Felix. ‐ Well, it's a good thing my band's finished rehearsing for the day. That's my band. ‐ "God's Sledgehammer"? ‐ That's right. ‐ Is that a Christian band? ‐ No. It's more of a stadium rock‐slash‐death metal band. ‐ Oh. 'Cause I'm a Christian, so... ‐ It is a Christian band. I'm a Christian myself, actually. Audrey? ‐ Oh, hey, Charlotte! ‐ Um, Beth's older brother is really sick. ‐ Oh, no! ‐ It's gastro. But I'm afraid I won't be able to chaperone the excursion tomorrow. ‐ Oh. Of course. A lot of my class is off sick with gastro as well. ‐ I hope I'm not leaving you in the lurch. Do you think you'll be able to find someone else? ‐ Hey! That's me! I'm someone else! Where are we going, Miss Caroline? ‐ Oh, the Force isn't working! ‐ Okay, so, we take it out of this... ‐ Mm‐hmm. ‐...then you take the blue safety cap off and you push the other end in here. So, it's "blue in the sky, orange in the thigh." ‐ Orange in the thigh! ‐ Yeah, I'm serious. "Blue in the sky" ‐‐ ‐ "Orange in the thigh." I've got it. Don't worry. He'll be fine. Actually looking forward to spending some quality time with my little Lord Vader. ‐ Can I bring this tomorrow, Uncle David? ‐ And that's the only reason why you want to go on this excursion tomorrow? ‐ Yeah. What other reason would there be? ‐ The one that teaches his kindy class. ‐ Miss Caroline? Come on. ‐ Every dad has tried to make a pass at her. ‐ Well, she's a Christian. I'm in a stadium rock‐ slash‐death metal band. How's that gonna work? ‐ Mommy, I nearly had it! ‐ I'm just trying to understand why you would so readily volunteer for something that sounds like your worst nightmare. ‐ Maybe it's because I'm actually a good person.

You become a professional when you're so good at something that you get paid to do it. I am a professional kindergarten teacher. And David is a professional singer. Isn't that right, David? ‐ Uh... that's correct. Yes, I am a professional singer, songwriter, guitarist. ‐ Maybe if we all nicely ask David, he'll come to the front of the bus and sing us all a song.

Do you realize how many animals they have here that can kill you? Listen to this. "The funnel‐web spider is the world's nastiest arachnid. "The venom from this hairy spider's massive fangs "attacks a person's nervous system, leading to death. The red‐bellied black snake can grow up to seven feet long."

Attention, all units. Attention, all units. Reinforcements have arrived. Set up a perimeter. ‐ Door's secure. Still no signal, though. ‐ Miss Caroline! Miss Caroline! ‐ Max, that's not safe! Put it back where you found it. There's no landline either. ‐ This is fun. ‐ It is a bit scary. It's meant to be scary. It's part of the game. And you know what? We all just won first level. Yes? ‐ How many more levels will there be? ‐ Mmm... Max? ‐ When will we play putt‐putt golf? ‐ Later. Kim? ‐ What's wrong with Teddy McGiggle? ‐ Teddy McGiggle is just... not happy because we're winning. Nobody's coming for us. We're all gonna die. ‐ Are we gonna die, Miss Caroline? ‐ No! Of course not. My job is to keep you safe. That's what I'll do. ‐ Where's Frogsie? ‐ Frogsie didn't make it. ‐ I need you to calm down, Teddy McGiggle. ‐ Don't you dare tell me what to do. Those things out there ate my cameraman. They ate him! And not just them. Little dead‐eyed kids. Like Children Of The Corn. And if they don't eat you, you get bit and then you become one of them. They're... They're zombies. ‐ Like in the shooty game? ‐ Like in the shooty game! Can you tell us what the zombies do in the... shooty game, please, Felix? Well, if you make noise, they hear you. They walk around and try to bite you. And the only way you can stop them is by shooting them in the face with your shooty gun or chopping their heads off. ‐ Okay. But are the zombies real? No. It's just a game, but Uncle David lets me play it when my mom's asleep. ‐ Well, there you go. The zombies are not real. Like fuck they're not! The Easter Bunny isn't fucking real! Father fucking Christmas isn't real! These inquisitive dead‐eyed fucking faces are real! ‐ ♪ Bad word! Bad word! ♪ ♪ 'Cause you said a bad thing, now‐‐ ♪ ‐ Shut the fuck up! Teddy McGiggle's gonna fill you guys in on some fast‐breaking news. Bad word song? That existed at a time when people weren't having their faces ripped off by motherfucking zombies. Fuckity fuck‐fuck fuck! You fucking little duckies! ‐ Teddy McGiggle just needs a cuddle. Come here. Let's have a word. ‐ I don't want a cuddle. ‐ Listen, Okay? You're going to change that attitude right now. ‐ Fucking zombies. ‐ This is not a negotiation. - ‐ Guys, who's hungry? - ‐ ‐ Yeah? Okay. Well, come get some. Here you go, mate. ‐ Are these okay, Uncle David? ‐ Yeah. ‐ Why is Teddy McGiggle crying? ‐ I'm a celebrity. ‐ No. You're a liability. I have no idea what we're all dealing with here, but my only responsibility is for these children's safety. If they are put in danger by anyone outside or inside the souvenir kiosk, my job is to remove that danger. I'm not going to let these children be traumatized by having them think a zombie is going to eat them alive. So, right at this very moment, these children believe they are in the middle of a game. A fun, harmless game. So if you don't turn that frown upside down, then, so help me God, I am going to drag you out by that stupid bow tie and watch them rip you apart! Do I make myself clear? Let me hear you say, "It's a game," so loud, they can hear. It's a game. ‐ In the voice, you moron. ‐ It's a game! This is a game! ‐ Uh‐huh. Do the laugh. ‐ I don't want to. ‐ Do the laugh. ‐ And stop fucking swearing. ‐ You can consider this the naughty corner. ‐ You okay? ‐ Cough it up, mate. Cough it up. ‐ What did you eat, Felix? It's anaphylaxis. No. No, they're just chips. ‐ They'd have dairy in them. ‐ Who the fuck puts milk in chips? ‐ Just breathe, okay? ‐ What do we do? ‐ My bum bag. The DreniPenny was in my bum bag. I've got one. I've got one. ‐ Oh. Give it... ‐ I can do it. I can do it. ‐ Okay. Okay, kids. Don't worry. Felix just needs some room, okay? ‐ Here we go. Uh, "Orange in the sky, blue in the... thigh." Arggh! ‐ Oh, dear. ‐ What?! ‐ No, no. It's fine. Here. ‐ No, you can't reinsert it! ‐ No. No! Um... There's a spare! Tess packed a spare! ‐ Where is it? ‐ It's, it's‐‐ in his backpack! I'll go get it. I'll go get it. Don't leave. ‐ I'm here. - Okay, kids. - ‐ ‐ No, no. I'm right here, bud. I'm right here. ‐ Listen very carefully. I need you to stay here with David. Hold hands and don't let go until I get back. Okay? Breathe. You'll be all right. ‐ Get them to stop the game, Miss Caroline! ‐ Don't worry about it. I'll just pop right up and let them know. ‐ Breathe. You're all right. You'll be all right. There we go. Breathing. ‐ Just try to breathe, mate, please. Keep breathing. ‐ Argh! ‐ We get through this, you can dress up as Darth Vader and play the shooty game as much as you want.

We're talking thousands. Thousands. I was doing my first public appearance, and this sweet little single mom came up to me after the autograph signing. And she was so fucking beautiful.

Go to sleep. ‐ This is ridiculous. ‐ What's the US military even doing here? ‐ Excuse me! My son is inside. Why won't you let us through? I'm gonna try him again. ‐ Got kangaroo, platypus, echidna, wombat. Dingo? ‐ Lieutenant, sir. Why are we here? ‐ Zombies again. ‐ Well, fast ones or slow ones, sir? ‐ Slow.

They won't let me past to where you are, and they won't tell us anything. If you get this message, could you please tell Felix that Mommy loves him? Dave, please look after him. ‐ Hey. Are you okay, mate? ‐ Yes, but Beth is a bit frightened. ‐ My mom puts me to bed. ‐ Oh. Well, we're gonna see your mom tomorrow. ‐ I'm scared. ‐ My mommy made up a special rhyme to help me go to sleep. Do you want to hear it? "Now the day is over and I'm in bed, rugged up tight, "I hope those little monsters won't get me in the night. "If I say this little rhyme, they'll try to put up a fight, "But they won't come get me, "No, they won't give me a fright. Little monsters, you go away! Little monsters‐‐" ‐ Oh, I think we need Beth to help with this bit, yeah? Beth, when I point at you, can you say, "Go away"? ‐ Go away? ‐ Yeah, exactly like that. Yeah. Okay, let's start again. "Little monsters, you can't stay! "I don't want to see your little claws! "I don't want to hear your little roars! Little monsters‐‐" ‐ "Go away!" ‐ "Come back and see me in the day. "We can have a little party "And eat cake and tea and play. "But we all must get a proper sleep, So, little monsters, please..." ‐ "Go away!" ‐ That's it. That's exactly it. You reckon you can sleep now? ‐ Mm‐hmm. ‐ Yeah? Okay. ‐ How did you know the rhyme, Uncle David? ‐ Well, your mom used to sing it to me before I went to sleep. Back when I was Boo‐Boo. - ‐ Boo‐Boo? - ‐ Boo‐Boo, yeah. You want to get some rest, mate? ‐ Goodnight, Uncle David. ‐ 'Night, mate. ‐ ‐ Oh, God. ‐ Sorry I've been swearing so much, Audrey. ‐ That's fine, David. I'm fucking terrified too. I just need them to feel like the adults are in control, you know? - How do you do it? - Do what? ‐ Be a superhero. ‐ Not quite. Do you want kids? ‐ Oh... my girlfriend and I just split. Yeah, I caught her with someone else. ‐ Oh. That's... awful. ‐ See, it wasn't her fault. I left first. She wanted a baby. I didn't. ‐ How come? ‐ I told her I didn't want it to get in the way of my band. ‐ Was that not the reason? ‐ Felix's mom reckons I might be frightened of being a father. See, our dad left when I was about Felix's age. Started another family, left Tess and I with mom. Mom fell apart. Like, really fell apart. We spent our holidays in psych wards. ‐ I'm so sorry. ‐ Yeah. Tess looked after me. I couldn't see that at the time, though. I was too angry at everyone. I never thanked her. ‐ I'm sure you won't end up like your father, David. "The man in between waits between the two, "Not hearing the lie, not seeing the true, "Unknowing what is and denying what seems, And there he will sleep, the man in between." ‐ Wow. Is that Gandhi? ‐ No. Neil Diamond. ‐ You like Neil Diamond? ‐ I love Neil Diamond. ‐ Oh. ‐ You may think I'm a superhero, but... When I was 18, I was heading down a really bad path. I started following this band around. I used the money my parents had put away for my education, and I followed them here. ‐ Whoa. ‐ I chased them all around Australia, and I break into one of their hotel rooms in Perth. Well, I was just so determined to meet one of them in person. I would have let them do anything to me. ‐ What... what happened? ‐ Oh, Taylor walked into the room and called security right away. ‐ Hang on. Wait. Swift? ‐ No! Taylor Hanson. Sorry. I thought I said who they were. ‐ Taylor Hanson? ‐ Yeah. Taylor Hanson. From Hanson. ‐ Hanson the band? ‐ Yes. ‐ "Mmmbop"? ‐ "Mmmbop." ‐ Mmm. Okay. ‐ I begged him not to call security, but he didn't even hesitate. I didn't know what to do, so I jumped out the window. ‐ Shit. ‐ But thank God, an awning broke my fall and all I broke was my collarbone. So, there I was. In a foreign country, in a sling. No parents, no money. And then a wonderful thing happened. I got a job helping out at the school to help pay my medical bills and get back home. And working with kids... ...standing in front of them, looking at me with no judgment... They trusted me even when I didn't particularly trust myself. I started to believe in myself again, you know? Learned to step up. And now I can't imagine doing anything else. ‐ Are you and... Ian gonna have kids? ‐ I'm afraid Ian and I have not been together for a long time. He was cheating on me. With someone from his work. ‐ But why do you still wear the ring? ‐ It stops fathers from hitting on me in the playground. I know it's bad to lie, but you'd be surprised how crude men can be. ‐ My band broke up six years ago. God's Sledgehammer fell apart when my bandmates quit. And I'm not really Christian. ‐ Anything else you've lied about? ‐ No, I think that pretty much covers it. ‐ Okay. Good. Otherwise I'd have to put you in the naughty corner. ‐ Uh‐oh. ‐ Why don't I stay up on watch? ‐ No, no. You need sleep more than anyone. Um... I'll step up. ‐ Okay. ‐ 'Night. All‐unit command, all‐unit command. All‐unit command, all‐unit command. ‐ In order to ensure total annihilation of the infected, we will proceed with Operation Hailstorm in T‐minus one hour. ‐ ‐ Oh! I've got an idea to get us out of here. ‐ No. No, no, no! No, no, no. No. I'm not going anywhere. Want to know why? Because I'm the Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Favorite Global Television Presenter five years running, that's why. You want to know what that means? That means to the layman I'm a huge fucking deal. Someone will notice that I'm missing, sound the alarm, and come and get me. ‐ We can't stay here indefinitely. ‐ We're good as dead if we stay here. There's no food. ‐ We'll eat one of the kids. ‐ I hope you're joking. ‐ Look, Teddy, all we need for you to do is make a distraction while I make a run for the tractor train. I drive it to the front door, we load everyone up, and we drive out of here. ‐ Oh, you're fucked in the head, fatso. Why can't you go? ‐ I'm not leaving the children alone with you. ‐ Pfft! If your big idea is to drive in a tractor designed to pull fuckmonkeys around a farm, then you're bigger idiots than I thought. And I thought you were both the stupidest people I've ever met. ‐ What would you suggest? ‐ The McGigglemobile. ‐ What? ‐ What, are you fucking deaf? I said in a loud whisper, "The McGigglemobile." ‐ What's the McGigglemobile? ‐ It's my bright red car, you fucking cunt. I travel around the world in it making memories and sharing those memories with children all over the country. Many countries. ‐ Why is that better? ‐ The McGigglemobile has a flap in the roof. The Frogsie flap. We drive the car around, the kiddlywinks jump into the McGigglemobile through the Frogsie flap, and we drive the fuck out of here. ‐ Who's got the keys? That actually could work. ‐ Great idea, Teddy. ‐ Great enough for a blow job? Um... I'm a sex addict. Hey. Listen. Be careful when you‐‐ ‐ Aarrghh! Goddammit! ‐ Are you okay, Teddy? ‐ Does it look like I'm okay, you shithead?! Miss Caroline! Miss Caroline! ‐ ‐ Miss Caroline, I'm hungry. ‐ I know. ‐ Miss Caroline? - I don't want to play this game anymore. - Uh‐huh. ‐ It makes no sense, and the zombies look fake. ‐ Miss Caroline, when are we gonna play putt‐putt golf?! ‐ Yo! Douchebag! Are we gonna do this thing or what? ‐ What's a douchebag? ‐ It's a small bag that ladies use to irrigate their vaginas. ‐ One, two, three, eyes on me.

Miss Caroline's gonna keep you safe. You do whatever she tells you to, okay? ‐ She's my teacher. I have to do that. ‐ You're an amazing boy. Don't let anyone ever tell you you're not strong.

Uh, the military have blocked off the road, but they won't let us through. We're not far from you. Why aren't you with Felix? Are you okay? ‐ Look, Tess, I need to tell you something. It's really important, and I should have done it a long time ago. But thank you. ‐ What? ‐ You stepped up. You always took care of me when things went to shit with mom. I don't know what I would have done without you. Thank you, sis. I tried to repay you, but... I'm pretty sure I've just fucked it. Ah! No! Fuck! Stupid fucking frog! - ‐ Boo‐Boo? - ‐ Miss Caroline, when will we play putt‐putt golf?! ‐ Not now, Max. ‐ No! I want to play putt‐putt golf now! ‐ ‐ Max. Max! ‐ ‐ I'm not‐‐ I'm not gonna talk to you on that level. ‐ ‐ Stop it.
