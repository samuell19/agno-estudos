I'm such a wimp! I think all kinds of things, but I can't say any of them. You're really cool. Just like a figurine. Can I touch your hair, too? So smooth... I always wanted to touch your blonde hair. A girl like me shouldn't want... ...things she knows she can't have. Living on pure instinct is barbaric. I just can't submit to that. If I married 'One' out of instinct, I'd never be happy. From my wedding day I'd be like a guard checking to see that he still loved me. How could you be happy like that? With 'Two' I could just pretend it was happening to someone else. I'd come out of the chapel in my dress, go running down some hill... ...leave Two behind me and play in the waves... ...gasping for breath in my low-cut dress... ...and enjoy being a bride. But still... ...I love One. TREMBLE ALL YOU WANT If you would... It's wrong. Here. You're right! One plus one equals one. Whoops! Glad that's not for the project. We'd be out by millions. That wouldn't look good. Dealing in hundreds of millions makes me nervous. I only slept three hours last night. That's no good. Broke it. Thanks for the pencil. He didn't ask. He just took it! Don't get so mad, Yoshika. I'm not mad. I'm scornful. Accounting gets no respect. It doesn't. You're against power stones? I didn't say anything. You're laughing at me over my love charms. Mr 'Tacky-sushi' in Sales? 'Takasugi'! I thought you were kidding. Love at the office! A boyfriend from work... That's incredible. It's normal. I want to keep love and work separate. You're so serious. I can't imagine loving the same guy since Grade 8. You don't know Ichi. 'Ichi' means 'one', but who cares if he's 'one'or 'two'? 'Two'? Who? Lights out. Cut it out! You don't like me saying you're cute as a puppy with your hair mussed up? Hey, hey! Come on, Ichi! Your hair's all wet! I'll wipe it for you. The Natural Born Prince Why 'prince'? He was born a prince. Weird hair. Ichi! Come play soccer! Eto You realize that I'm watching you blink? You blink while you massage. Is that a tic? You noticed that? Wow! Side-sight. 'Side-sight'? Lateral vision. I made it up. That's how I watched Ichi back in middle school. Everyone wanted a piece of him. Like he was a cat or something. But he was a prince, not a cat. I kept a respectful distance. The one who understands and the one who is understood. Yes. And I was the only one who... Ow ow ow ow ow! Understanding someone brings tension. It sure does! I was always afraid someone would see that the prince in my comic... ...was modeled on Ichi, and think I had no shame. But that never happened. Maybe my comic wasn't very good. Don't be so modest. No, it wasn't that great. Self-satisfaction? Looking back, maybe I was drunk on myself. Proud that I wasn't like that bunch who were all milling around Ichi. I'm the only one who can free him from everyone's gaze. Hence your evolution. Yes, evolution! The need to see him without being seen myself... ...made me evolve. I built up my eye muscles. Try it. 'Side-sight'. So you see beside yourself. That's hard. Animals hide that they're there. You'll catch more fish. Just like this, now. I'm looking at your float. Look, look... People usually talk about themselves like this on a social network. I couldn't. I'm not brave enough to post things about someone as useless as me. Or maybe I'd just be too embarrassed. Extinct Animals The Dodo Ammonites Yes? Delivery for Yoshika Eto from Yoshika Eto. It's heavy. Shall I put it inside? Leave it there, thanks. Thank you. I'm still sleepy. I'm a slave to Wikipedia. Looking at extinct animals again? You wouldn't believe how many species have been lost because of us. I feel so guilty I could die! My sleep was unsound. Just kidding. I slept like a log. I'm the type that could be driven extinct myself. Anyway, it arrived. My ammonite fossil. The museum clear-out one? Yes. I wish I'd seen it where they found it, though. The weight changes depending on the date and the location. The weight has weight. But it must have been expensive. Not really. The ones with the weird twists are. The 'nipponites'. They're way beyond the means of an office clerk. Of course! Don't be silly! What does this say? One? Two. It's him. 'Two'? Oh, him. Let's give him hell at the office party tomorrow. I can't wait. Go for it. You're going, right? No, it's Friday. Tamori Club is on TV. Takahashi in Planning has won 16 towels on 'Mondegreen Hour'. He's amazing. Just record it. I do. Then you can come. You'll be fine alone. I understand. I was the same. How? I don't mean that. You laugh at me for giving myself to love. I don't. I have Ichi. In my mind I summon him. I'm as big a fool as you. I'll hit on Takasugi... You will? OK, I'll come. Yay! I want to see Tackysushi fall. Don't say that in front of him! What's his name? 'Takasugi'! You don't even try to remember names. You make up weird nicknames. I can't look at the Section Manager since you started calling him 'Freddie'. It's that look on his face and those suspenders. Soon he'll all be in white. Stop it! Who was your neighbor? Ocarina? That one's pretty easy. She plays the ocarina. What's her name? Dunno. The big city, huh? Yeah. Ms Tsukishima, are the estimates done? Well? You got 'em? Yes, they're ready. We're on different floors, so new staff in Sales and Accounts don't talk much. So thanks to Sales Section 1 for arranging this. Let's see... The girls in Accounts are all very precise. To be honest, they'd make great wives. Shut up make the damn toast! We should all learn from the women in Accounts. Anyway, let's drink. Cheers! Hi, Takasugi! Ms Tsukishima, isn't it? Hello. Sit down and let's talk. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. You were in the Cheerleading Club at your university? You knew that? You have that air about you. Not just some Arts guy. Should you start a conversation by dissing Arts? You, me, her... we all took Arts, right? Sorry. No, I should apologize. I was in the Debating Club, too. I can't help myself. The problems of being smart. You've got fat! Yuck! That's some real BMI there! Fuck! Something wrong? Phone call. The toilet's inside. 'The toilet's inside'! That's funny. Uh, Ms Eto... ...do you know who I am? 'Two'. You wrote 'two' upside down. 'Two upside down' like that. That's funny! You're cute. No signal... Hey hey hey! Sorry, sorry. Just a minute...sorry. I'll send you the photo. Would you tell me your Line ID? 'QR'... Pic from tonight. 'Kiri' 'Two' I will not forget things. Is that from Ms Midorikawa? She'll check when I reach 100. 65... Like 'The Simpsons'! 66... Who's that? A foreigner? If you change one, she won't notice. I will forget 'The Simpsons' is an anime. Bart's always writing lines in the opening. Every time's different. The first time I ever spoke to him. You jumped right in. I wished I hadn't. I'd devolved to living by instinct. I see. It was a shock. Every time I tell Ichimiya to write a hundred lines... ...he always fights back with one that says the exact opposite. Here. 'I will be late.' All year long! That kid! A year later he'd remembered what I told him. I was so happy! That's the One I summon in my mind. That kid! Ms Midorikawa, that teasing isn't aimed at you. That sentence is proof of his spiritual connection with me. And so... ...don't take credit for it. Saturday afternoon, right? 'Beautiful Saturday.' That's right. I figured you'd be here, and you were. Yep. Would you like to go out with me? You choose the place. I got lost. Suit and tie? I came from work. Sorry to out-dress you. Here? Yeah. So tell me about yourself. Tell me what kind of person you are. Born in October in snow country, blood type B, only child, no boyfriend. Likes extinct animals. So much that sometimes I sit up all night on Wikipedia. Some ammonites in the Cretaceous Period evolved very weird shapes... You're single? Yeah, right now. Yeah? Oh. What? Sports? You do any? No matter how busy I am, I always do exercises before bed. With work, your body is your capital. Watch. Just this gives a great upper body workout. It really works. And for the lower body... ...side jumps. It's hard, but if you work at it, it's good for fast-twitch response. You're gazing at me. That's fantastic! Huh? Anyway... ...anyway, sorry for suddenly asking you out. Why? What's with this place, anyway? What? You said choose the place, so I chose this club. You come here? First time. I always wanted to, but I wasn't comfortable coming alone. Keep it down, will you! I don't fit in here. Let's continue this outside. Outside! Outside! Sorry! Excuse me. Careful! Hey! The station's this way. Hey! Just once, OK? Just once. I don't know... Just once. We're going home, right? Aw, man! I'm such a klutz! It was all that jumping around on the dance floor. It's the cheap booze in those places! So you're blaming it on me? Here. Thanks. Shit! All my plans wrecked! No! I won't let this happen! I bet my whole life on this! Let's go. Your breast... You had a red post-it on the left one. When? Six months ago. When we were really busy before the shareholders meeting. It stuck to you when you brought some stuff back to our section. When I saw that... ...it made an impression on me. I got them to have that party last night... ...as a low-pressure way to get to know you. I got you to come out tonight... ...so I could say something. Ms Eto... ...be my girlfriend. Once! Just this once! OK! Chaos. I'll wait for an answer. Can you see it in me? A man said he loves me! I see it! Congratulations! Thank you! Here you are! Here I am! My first confession of love! Sudden, and real! Reality, right in the middle of a sleazy hotel district! What looks ugly at first might just be beautiful. That's a beautiful Sunday! What did he say? 'I like you?' Huh? He didn't say that. No, he didn't. That's not fair. Shouldn't he say that? First he wants a girlfriend. The voice of basic instinct. How barbaric! I'd say it, if the time came. I'd come straight out with it. Look here. Look at me. Getting that out of One... ...was a reward for me developing side-sight. You've all worked very hard today. Look here. Look at me. I'm going to die! Evacuate! Get everyone out! No! No! Don't die! Don't die! Don't die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Don't die! Don't die! Don't die! Don't die! I know. I can't die yet. I have to do what I want to do as fast as I can. I've learned that people die! People do die, don't they. Yes! So I don't want to summon One in gym clothes. I want to see him as he is now and then stride forward into death. Like the 47 Samurai! 'Ah, what joy! No bitter regret to bind me, I cast this body aside. 'No cloud blocks the moonlight of this fleeting world.' 'Ah, what joy!' 'No bitter regret to bind me, I cast this body aside. 'No cloud blocks the moonlight.' 'Ah, what joy!' Right! Right! Right! Right! Right! Oka, Rina My name rules my life. A name is very important. Rena Murasakidani! She fled abroad. 'Rena'... Yay! Gotcha! Idiot! You're mine. Now I am Rena Murasakidani! I'm going to use a false name and organize a class reunion. Then I can 'bump into' One. You engineer an encounter. Yes. Like Two did to get me out drinking. I've got to give him credit for that idea. I could have used a friend like he did, but I don't have friends like that. I don't have any friends at all. That's just not true. When you start a fire, you put it out, and apologize with sword on stomach. There's no time to buy new bedding. You have to change your whole life. It's like I've already died once. I've been in love for half my life. It's time to get busy. You're really cute, you know. O God, please let me see One before I die, even if it's only once. Praying to God! Go, girl! 'I've invited everyone... '...but Ichi hasn't answered. 'Try his parents' place.' Whoa, Abe! I hate making phone calls! God! Help me! It's strange to hear 'God' coming from you. I guess it's like Akira says. Women need gods. 'Morning. 'Morning. Who's 'Akira'? Takasugi. You took Tackysushi down? I wish I'd seen that! Hey! Could you stop calling him that now? It's cute how he likes to show off. Give him a break. 'Stand by your man,' huh? You're in love! You should try it. Two was asking about you after you left Friday night. Stuff like where you'd like to go. What you do all the time is a mystery to me. I told him he should just ask you. Yeah, OK. Or should I stay out of it and tell him not to call you? No. He asked me to go steady. What?! That fast? You're kidding! I almost dropped dead in surprise. Love's a gamble you bet your life on. So did you say yes? I've got One. Two wants me to go fishing in Okutama on Christmas. What an idiot! In this cold? There's a waterfall there that's a famous power spot! A sacred rock! Akira showed me... ...a blog by a guy who follows a guy who wrote a book about Steven Jobs. He went there in secret. For sure. Wait, who did? You were asking God for something. Go there! That was just... You're trembling, Ms Eto. Here. You're not cold? I'm used to it. I need to go somewhere. Toilet? Behind that rock's fine. Hey, careful! Um... ...could I get an answer to my question? I'm not sure yet. It's the one who falls who loses. Play the victim! Play the victim! Yeah, right! Play the victim, you pest! Wonderful! It's so wonderful! It's wonderful! Hello? My name is Murasakidani. I was in school with your son... Tokyo?! He's living in Tokyo? Since when? Will he go home at New Year's? Yes, the class reunion on December 30th. Mr Ichimiya has to be there. God, uh, 'Mrs Ichimiya', tell him to come! Please! And thank you! He's in Tokyo! O God! One's in Tokyo! That took a while. Are you OK? No tissue paper? I was going to go and look, but I didn't want to embarrass you. The air in Tokyo is so nice. I never knew that before! So that's how it is! Merry Christmas. I didn't get you one. Don't worry about it. Something with meaning for us. Red post-its. Thank you. I'll use them for special occasions. Tokyo's so beautiful! Let's go eat. I'm fine. I'm full. Stomach and heart? It's freezing! Thanks! You're working hard. Yes. Is your heater off? I threw it out. Happy New Year. 'Damn! 'I've got Spanish flu. Have a good night. 'Rena Murasakidani.' It's been years! And you're still crazy, Abe. You live alone in Ariake, Kimura? That's all high-rise condos. Must be nice to be in IT. It's not all high-rises, but I live in one. Wow! You live in a high-rise? It's been ages! Sorry! Kaoru! I thought she was you. Who is she? You're kidding! Ichi! You're late, Ichi! Murasakidani had a hell of a time finding you. She's got Spanish flu. Yuck! Ichi! Come sit over here. Here we are. You'll only get one chance. You're right. Thank you! I'm working in Tokyo right now. Whoever's in Tokyo, raise your hands. Me. Oh yeah? Who else? Ichi? You work in Tokyo? Why didn't you say so? We could get together! Me, too! Tokorozawa? It's almost Tokyo! It's miles away! Let's all talk over here. OK? The Tokyo bunch. I didn't know you were in Tokyo. Yeah! Why didn't you say? Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'll send this around. Tell me your Line IDs. Let's start a group. I know Kimura's. Shall we get together when we get back to Tokyo? Sure, let's do that. If you like, you could all come to my place. In the high-rise? Great! You're invited. It's settled. I'll come if I can. We need everyone. Yeah! It's just that I've gotten busy lately. But it's no fun without you. Come on! Don't be a drag! Kimura... ...can I say when I'm free? Sorry! Sorry! I think I'm happy. One says... Oh, you went? One's perfect, you know. I just love everything he does. Even his being over-sensitive. Are you listening? Yoshika! Your dad's here! I just love One. I love One! I love One! I love One! I love One! Do you need help? I love One! I love One! 'Happy New Year! Let's make it a happy one. 'P.S. Fishing at Christmas was fun, wasn't it. 'Could I ask you to go again?' I want to marry the one I love. Isn't it a bit early to be talking about marriage? I haven't mentioned that to Akira. You haven't? So that's how it is? Well, as a matter of fact... Don't tell anyone. I've never had a boyfriend in my life. So starting up with one at my age... ...that girlfriend/boyfriend stuff... ...it scares me somehow. I think Two would be the perfect guy to start with. Huh? I'm sure he wouldn't hurt you. Lights out. Kurumi... If we end up doing it, let me ask you for advice. I don't want him to know I've never done it. Advice? Me? You have nice long eyelashes. Can I touch them? So it's love? You look great. You're back-lit. Sublime. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you. Thank you. Thank... I thought it was you! It's great running into you like this. I saw you from my car. I'll give you a ride. I bought you a racket. Come on! A what? This way. Not today! Sorry. Oh, I get it. Girls' night out? I see. People do that after New Year's. OK. My fault. I'm sorry I haven't called yet this year. You were worried. It's OK. I'll be there, waiting for you. Thanks. 'Bye. What do you want? I just wanted to see you off. I'll be on my way now. It's Ichimiya. Who's he? Your friend's brother? Right! So I'll see you next weekend, right? What floor? There isn't one. 45th Floor, huh? That's way up there. I'm impressed. Didn't I tell you? A friend from school lives here. His wife's from Lebanon. No, that's George Clooney. Where was it? Norwegian! Yeah, that's right. It's high latitude in North Europe. The thin air's good for you. Up in the penthouse. Too much for me. Your lips get all dried out. Cold, isn't it. Yeah, it sure is! Here, take this. It's all used up! Goodbye. Yeah, I'm going up. Salmon! You like that? Yeah! Thanks. And shake, too. Doesn't shake mean 'salmon'? I don't know. Whatever. Yuzukosho paste. I saw some by the sink. Maybe shake is male and 'salmon' is female. I'm fine. Yeah? I don't know. Maybe shake is... Just forget it! I'll clean up later. I don't mind. Don't do that. Come and talk. It's OK. I can hear everything. It bothers me. We'll all do it later. See? Leave it, will you? Sorry. So? We were talking about salmon. No, we weren't! Hey! It's still January... Is she drunk? She should lie down. What are you drawing? Hey, that's cute! A character. Have it. No, thanks. You should sleep, maybe. Kimura and Kaoru went to the store and haven't come back. Shall we sleep? Ichi! Carry me to bed. Now. Where are you going? Water. I had hair like that in school. 'The Natural Born Prince.' It's you, in middle school. That's me? You were... ...like a prince. How? You've got a weird take on it. I was bullied all the way through. Bullied? No, you weren't. Everyone liked you so much they all wanted to touch you... No. I didn't want it. That makes it bullying. I hated it. That's why I didn't want to go to that reunion. I just thought you weren't comfortable being looked at... ...and centered out. You are weird. You talk as though you knew me. Um... ...if you don't remember 'The Natural Born Prince'... ...then you probably don't remember talking to me at Field Day. I remember that. At the closing ceremony. 'Look at me,' you said. Suddenly it bothered me that you weren't looking at me. I don't know why. Sorry. You wanted someone to look at you? No. Just you. You were the only one who never looked at me. It's weird to remember. Young guys are idiots. Talk about something, will you? Talk about something? Like what? How about an extinct bird, the dodo? Great. It's love. Ancient animals, extinct animals. I love them. Why? I don't know. It's just fascinating to imagine twisted creatures roaming the earth. 'Twisted', huh? Maybe that's why I feel such a good fit with them. Ammonites coiled up on themselves like scallop frills to survive. That encourages me. The nipponites? They're held up as an example of evolution causing extinction... ...but the climate change theory is more widely accepted. You know that! I love this stuff. I have books. I bought an ammonite fossil. I couldn't afford a nipponite, though. These days I'm into the giant Japanese elk. The antlers were to find mates and it died out when they got too big? Gotta love that one. Failures at life. You want to cry. It's amazing talking to you. It's like I'm talking to myself. Yeah. In school I wanted to be friends with you. Yeah. Nipponites twisted like scallop frills... that's something, honey. Ichi... Are you the kind of guy who calls girls 'honey'? Sorry. What's your name? Call me by my name. This damn thing's busted! The name of that man... ...I don't know. This person's name, too... ...I don't know it. After all... ...I've never talked... ...to this person. May I take your glass? Because she looks like a little doll... ...I've wanted to talk to her. Because her hair is so beautiful... ...I've wanted to touch it. I could never do that. I'd be a nuisance. She'd look at me... ...with eyes filled with hate, wouldn't she? Should I go extinct? Should I go extinct? I don't know his name, either. An interesting guy anyone would want to talk to. But I don't have the guts. The old man who fishes there from morning till night... I'd love to talk to him but I never have. I've never gotten any closer to him than this. This is the distance that separates me from the world. We're invisible to one another. It's like... ...no one can see me. Should I go extinct? Hey ammonite... ...tell me how... ...to survive. How many times do you have to coil around... ...before things get easy? Every day is twisted. Twisted as a nipponite fossil. Ms Eto! I thought a lot about where we might go. Maybe my kind of place this time. I hope you like it. Pretty, isn't it. Thank you for doing that. You knit very well. Not at all. I always see you knitting on the bus. Oh. You try and try and try again. That's how it is. Sorry, sorry! So graceful. Look at those teeth! Scared? Of course not! Take a picture. Here goes. Did you get it? Yes, I did. Really? Is this really real? So...should we be girlfriend and boyfriend? Are we already? Well... ...what do you think? Uh, well... ...OK, we are. Great! Great! Great! We're dating! I thought we might be. Great! Fantastic! But why are you thinking that now? It's like it's sort of natural. It feels right. So natural it doesn't seem real. Hey! This is real, Ms Eto. We're officially going out. Fantastic! It something I was thinking looking at my parents. More than things like love or hate... ...it's more important that it feels right. I see. Well... ...even if we are going out, I don't want to get married right away. Did I say 'marry'? No. I did. Yeah. It's just that you mentioned your parents. Just in passing. Sorry...huh? No, no. I just remembered Ms Tsukishima saying you were looking to marry. Kurumi said that? It's just that I asked her about you. Why? I wanted to find out about you. I like you. I can imagine maybe getting married to you... ...but I don't want to talk about that till I'm a little more mature. Anyway, I like you. Yoshika! Yes? Can I call you that? OK. Yoshika... What do you want to call me? There's an octopus after me! Wait! Ms Eto, wait! Ms Eto! I'm sorry to shock you yesterday. I feel bad about it. I brought you lunch. Right now... ...I've never been so happy. I want to pick you up and spin you around... ...but I don't want to scare you, so I'm resisting that. But... ...I was a fool for suddenly trying to kiss you. Ms Tsukishima warned me. She said other things as well as me wanting to get married? Uh... Let's go to that bar with Ms Tsukishima next time... What did she say? Hey! Don't look so serious. Tell me. Well, stuff like since you've never had a boyfriend... ...that I should take it slow with you. To be honest, it's unusual that you've never been with anyone. And to be honest, I find that purity very adorable. And it makes me think that you're adorable. Aw, come on! Don't be mad. She was just trying to help get things rolling with us. Whatever. Good. Now I've made up my mind. There's a guy I've liked ever since middle school. I've liked him for ten years. I've got two boyfriends. He's one, and you're the other. But now I'm going to boil it down to one. The one I like best, and so... ...goodbye. A virgin! A virgin! 'Morning. I want to die. I'd die if it wouldn't hurt. Rena Murasakidani Are you OK? 'Morning. What's wrong? You don't look well. Yoshika? Morning sickness. Yoshika? Stupid Kurumi! Stupid, stupid Kurumi! That stupid Kurumi went and told everything! So Two's perfect for me, huh? You slut! You pimpstress! You must really look down on me! You were just trying to help, huh? Thanks a hell of a lot! And Two... ...you saw one post-it, and thought it was an arrow pointing down! Fuck! I hate the kind of man who just wants a virgin! He has the nerve to just show up in my life... ...and wants to stroll into it with his damn shoes on! I'm on the 10-year program of love! That's right, One. What's going on, One?! Why... ...don't you remember my name? Why?! My narcissist prince! But... ...whatever he's like in real life, my ten years have not been wasted! I've been true to my love. There's beauty in that! Ocarina, shut up! You're driving me crazy! There's evil in me. Great! In this world, evil is stronger. Maternity Leave I'll win! With this I'm sure to win! Now I am invincible. I will let nothing defeat me! You won't refuse me, Freddie! No way. I can't give you maternity leave this early. You can't? This is Accounts. We need continuity. You know that. Congratulations, though. Then...I quit. Thank you very much. Hey, wait a minute! Aw, man! That's two from your year now. Takasugi's quitting Sales. Isn't that a waste of a good job? I'll give you vacation time. Take some time off! Yoshika, how are you? This is an early baby gift. A 'Mondegreen Hour' towel. I got it from Takahashi in Planning. A T-shirt would have been better, or maybe a jumper... I'm taking some time off. It's that bad? Well, whether it is or not... ...what's the point of spending my days... ...checking up on idiots who think 1 plus 1 equals 1? Only sustaining myself on how much I despise them? When I can't even add 2-figure numbers without a calculator? My inner voice keeps doing that. Crazy, huh? I must be. I toss garbage for someone to pick up without thinking twice about it. I've been strange for a long time. But I guess there's a cold comfort in saying thank you to someone... ...who isn't working for the thanks. Tackysushi's quitting. What? He's always saying how he wants to start on his own. He's resigned. You didn't know? You're his girlfriend? Anyway... ...who's the father? None of your business. I see. So this is being alone. Great! No Messages Hold the wasabi. Kurumi Tsukishima I want to die. Murasakidani's popular. I'm jealous. No! Don't die! Don't worry. I'm not going to. Huh? Haircut? How'd you know? I'm your boyfriend. Kurumi Tsukishima Replaying Message Congratulations on the baby, Yoshika. I'll take a chance and leave a message. I'm sorry I couldn't say that sooner. It's like you said. Akira handed in his resignation. But I'm fine. I'll deal with it. Did I do something to make you angry? If I did, I apologize. I'm sorry. Maybe... ...you're snubbing me? 'Snubbing'? This isn't Grade 8! Above all, congratulations. I'm sure it'll be a great baby. 'Bye. January 20th, 7:38 p.m. To erase this message, press 1. To save, press 2. 2 is save. Even if you erase 1, save Two. Save Two. Two. Saved. Two This number has blocked your call. Very nice. Hello. This is Murasakidani from Murasaki Enterprises. Sales Section 2, please. No umbrella? Well? I guess I had to come, but what do you want? To summon the real. Sorry. Thanks for coming. You don't look good. You need to stay healthy now. I'll take you to the hospital if you're sick. I'm not pregnant. I'm not pregnant. I lied. One thing led to another... What led to what? Stop messing up my life! What are you talking about? I didn't do anything. Like hell! Why would you lie like that? What's wrong with you?! I was angry because you and Kurumi were discussing my private life! Ms Tsukishima thought that would help. Like hell! She meant that. She didn't like me pretending I had a boyfriend. Then stop playing the victim. You can't say for sure there's no ill-will... ...in giving away someone's secrets, even if you don't intend to. But people do that sometimes. How would you feel? The whole company saw me blow up in the office. I'm mortified! Now I can never go back in to work again! I'm finished before I accomplished anything! Stop exaggerating! No one in the world accomplishes anything at our age. Joan of Arc! Don't try to win this by saying something crazy. You want to be great? Really, Yoshika? Two boyfriends? You're pregnant? In your brain...there's a devil! If there's a devil here, it's in you! A devil who wants virgins! That's why you liked me, isn't it? What?! Adorable because I'm a virgin! Why would you say that?! So once I'm not a virgin I'm worthless? That's horrible! Look, Yoshika... 'Ms Eto' to you! You don't even say my name. Who cares! I care! It hurts me. Suck it up! Or don't you like me? Look... ...do you realize what you're saying when you tell me to 'suck it up'? Most men would back off, but I'm clear in my mind about you. I'm going to believe in myself and press on. Isn't that big of you! That's so arrogant I'm trembling. Aw, man! You love me, right? I say barbaric things. Suck it up! To be honest, I don't love you yet. I'm still just at 'like'. I hate when you say 'to be honest'! I... ...pretty much... ...like you. Why? Maybe... ...you're unusual. What do you mean, 'unusual'? Twisted? No. Not twisted. And you're not great. But I want to be with you. You're full of things I can't figure out. I like you. But no matter how much someone likes you... ...you can't just come at them with everything hanging out. Having said that, when all is said and done... ...I like what I like. Have my child! I want the world to hear that. I lied. I just didn't dare look at you. This place smells nice. Yoshika... Kirishima... Ow! Tremble all you want.
