J“ - Hi! You stranger here? You come from far away? What you got to sell? Let me see, huh? Oh, why you get mad, big fellow? I give you coin, you let me blow tunes on that. You got blind eyes. You hear me okay. Why you no talk to me? I friendly. I talk. No tongue? Oh. You hear that? I go home, dress up. You save good tunes for the wedding. Today my friend Ramu, he is bride! - Happy, Tollea? - Yes, Ramu. - I just had to see you before. - So did I. And it isn't bad luck, is it? - Bad luck? - For the groom to see the bride before the ceremony. - Oh, nonsense. We're here. That's all that matters. - And that's all that ever will matter, Ramu. We'll always be together, won't we? Nothing will ever change that, will it? Will it? - Remember what we learned from Father Paul? Say it. - And Ruth said to Naomi-- - Whither thou goes, I will go. They people shall be my people. - And thy God, my God. Ramu. Why do you want me to say that today? - Don't we always say it? - Yes, but why today? - 1 want you to be sure. - Oh, but 1 am. - Hey, Koko! - Koko! - Well, a flower for the bride. - Go on and play, Koko. Do you know why Mr. MacDonald has a guard on my house? - A guard? - Oh, don't pretend you don't know about it. - Oh, MacDonald's nervous. I guess he wishes your mother could be here today. You don't remember her at all? - No. - I guess she could explain that. Can't MacDonald tell you? - He just says I have always had it. But whatever it means, it's part of yesterday. - And yesterday is dead. - Well, here's to the bridegroom. - A long and happy married life to you both, Ramu. - Thank you, Father Paul. - Come, set ye down, lad. It's most an hour till the ceremony. - We'll make it as painless as possible, my son. - Ramu. - Thanks. - Today, you must look nice. A fellow don't get married every day, eh, Father Paul? - Well, I should hope not. - Do I stand to the right of Tollea? - That's right, my son. - Do 1 have to say somethmg? - Two words. “1 do.“ Thanks to an all-wise Providence who figured that if's man had more to say, he wouldn't get married. - 1 are best man. If you get scare-sickness, I say it for you. Ramu not like the peddler fellow with no tongue. - Peddler? A stranger? - Big fellow stranger with no eyes, no tongue, nothing but donkey. Mouth only good to make music on pipe. - We better go to the church. I'm ready. - Ramu, haven't you forgotten something? " Huh? Oh, imagine going to my own wedding without any shoes. - Get ye out of that, lad. - You have brought many fine gifts for the wedding, hey, Mr. MacDonald? Everything for Ramu and Tollea. Nothing for me. - You're not getting married. - Since I lose such a valuable friend in marriage, a little present would make my heart lighter. - Before you ask me again, lad, let me tell you, you cannot have the blow pipe. - Oh, I would not expect Mr. MacDonald to make such a generous gift. - You don't believe, do you, lad, that a Scotchman would part With a valuable trophy? - And why not? - You mean you've never heard any stories about Scotchmen? - Only that they are fine warriors. - You hear that, Father? - Yes, I heard him. - The blow pipe is yours, laddie. ' No! But what good is the blow pipe without darts Such as the savages use? - They are yours, every one of them. - But take care, Kado. Those things are dangerous. - Aye. - I'll be careful, Father. You know, Mr. Mac, it is not all at all True what one hears about the Scotchman. - Why, you-- - The mission bell is ringing, Father. You think we ought to go? - Oh, brace up, Ramu. Sure there's nothing to worry about. - You're not frightened, are you, lad? - A little. - Don't be scared. I are with you. - Keep your chin up, son. It will soon be over. - Ramu! Ramu! Ramu! - Where's Tollea? - Has anything happened to her? Kado. - Tollea! Tollea! Tollea! Tollea, Tollea! Tollea! She's gone! - The guard is dead. Killed by a cobra. - Cobra! But there are no cobra here. - All the same, that's how he died. - Look. Music-maker also murder stick. - You're right, laddie. - The blind beggar was not blind. You know, I told you. Giant fellow, big like horse. Blow tunes on this. He say he come from far off distance. - Well, she must be on the island somewhere. - He'll find her, even if he has to turn the island upside down. - He'll never find her here, laddie. - That's where you'll find Tollea. - Cobra Island? - Aye. She's gone back to her people. - But, but they're not her people. She belongs here. - Tollea belongs to the cobra people. - I don't believe it. - Sit down, lad. - Well, how do you know? - This. - That killed the guard, not a cobra. - This is their symbol. The prongs are coated with cobra venom. - But why should they want to take her? - You'll find the answer to that right there. - How do you know she belongs there? - Many years ago, A hurricane caught my boat and tossed me around for four days. The first land I saw was Cobra Island. No ship has ever come back from there. - Yours did. - Aye, by a miracle. I was condemned to die, which is the Cobra law against strangers. - Then what miracle saved you? - 1 never knew. - What do you mean? - I was tortured, lad. Tortured into unconsciousness. - Oh, 1 see. And then? - Then when my mind cleared, I found myself at sea again and on my way home. And that night, I heard strange noises from the cabin, So I tied down the wheel and went below. And found a stowaway. - From the island? - Aye. A wee baby. Pretty as a rose and yelling at the top of her lungs. - It was Tollea. - Right, man. I brought her home here and raised her as my own. - I know she wouldn't go back there on her own accord. - In either case, she's gone, lad. We've got to make up our minds to that. Gone forever. - I'll find her. I'll bring her back. - From Cobra Island? - From anywhere. You don't suppose I believe those wild tales you dream up to scare Kado, do you? - No drug-soaked brain Could dream up the horrors of Cobra Island, lad. - A big black wall keeps the stranger out Of this land where people practice death! - Kado! Go back to bed. - My friend Ramu, he is there alone. He needs me. He is in danger. I are coming, Ramu. I are coming! Ooh, from the smoking volcano comes the poisonous cobra! Ready to strike! GOt him! Ah... - Kado. I said go back to bed. - Oh, where am I? Oh, I must have been sleepwalking around. Ramu, you must take me with you to that awful place. - How did you know I was going anywhere? - I saw you there in my dream. With Tollea. And, and the poisonous cobra ready to strike. - Oh, Kado, you must stay here. Now, you go on up to bed, get up in the morning, go to Father Paul's school And grow up to be a smart man like Mr. MacDonald. - Oh, I don't want to go to school! - Kado! Am I glad you showed up. - Friend dropped in for dinner, huh? I see there is enough food for two, but not enough for three, So I blow hard. High black walls keep strangers out. Like I see in my dream. - That's right, Kado. And the first thing in the morning, we're gonna climb that big, high wall. - Home of cobra people. - Somewhere there is Tollea. - Have you ever wondered what that meant? - All my life. - I am your grandmother, child. These people are your people. You were born here. - I don't believe it. - My daughter was your mother. She bore twin girls. At the age of a year, you were both submitted to the sting of the king cobra. You, the firstborn, the natural ruler, almost died from the venom, While Naja, your sister, proved immune. So she became high priestess while you, the supposed weakling, were to be destroyed after the island custom. - Why was 1 brought back? - To save your people from your sister's cruelty. - Where is my sister? - Kado, you stay here. - Stay here! I are stowaway with sweat and seasickness to be with my friend And now you say stay here. No, sir. - But it's important that you wait for me here. - Okay. I be important. I wait. But you be careful. Mr. MacDonald say cobra people kill strangers. I hate to see my friend with spears sticking out all over. - Tollea! Why did you run away from me? - Strange faces frighten me. Even handsome ones. - Strange? - I mean, well-known faces appearing unexpectedly. - You knew I'd follow you, didn't you? Why did you come here? - I belong here. - Oh, I know all that, but why did you come back to it? - Why, 1-- - What of our plans? Our future? - You don't have to hold me. I won't run away. - We'll go back where we belong, right now. - Please go now. - Where will I find you? - Right here. Tonight. Ladies, You have seen nothing unusual here today. Understand? - Koko! Koko! Koko, take me to Tollea. Feet hot, Koko. Cool 'el off. I know you! You fake blind beggar, who make music for my friend wedding. Wedding never happen, you steal his almost-wife. Kill man with music stick. - What happened, Hava? Where you come from? - From Harbor Island. I are here with my friend to look for his almost-wife. Koko here take me to her. This man mountain stop me. - Go, Hava. - Do you know where my friend is? - In prison. All strangers go to prison. - You see? As soon as he are away from me, he get in policeman trouble. You know where Tollea live? - She here? - Can 1 see her? - 1 take you. - Oh, thank you. - Tollea! - Oh, Kado, where is Ramu? - She say Ramu locked up. - Kado, this is the queen of the island. - Pleased to meet you. - I am sure she will help us. - No, sir, I only kneel down when Father Paul tell me to. You are the boss of the whole place? - No, just the queen. - If you're queen, you can help my friend out of his jail. - I'm afraid I can't do anything about that. Strangers on the island are executed. - Not Ramu. Not my friend. - I think I know a young man who is tired and hungry. I must speak with Tollea. See that he is fed and rested. - Yes, my queen. Bring little friend and come on. - You have kind face. I know you will help my friend. Sure thing. Come on, Koko. Come on, Koko. We are going to eat now. Hungry, huh? We have food, Koko. Food. Why my friend Ramu locked up? - Queen will tell you. All strangers get killed. - Oh, that bad. Mr. MacDonald say strangers make sacrifices for Cobra snake. That bad, too. Ramu will not like that. Big fire getting mad on mountain. Going to cook somebody? - Fire mountain angry. High priestess send many more people up thousand steps to fire. - Live people? My friend too? No, ma'am. Too many steps. My friend lazy fellow. - Veeda! - Yes, I'm coming. - You shall see for yourself the cruel barbarism by which Naja Holds our people. Fear has made them religious fanatics. Hava, you will take Tollea to the Council Temple through the royal tunnel. Veeda will wait here for her return. I charge you with her safety. Go, my dear. - The faithful grow more unfaithful to their high priestess. The gold tribute grows less and less. Demand more. Punish them. - Defiers of the faith! Fire mountain grows more angry! I demand more gold. The flame shrine blazes with fury. Listen! She cries for obedience to her laws, for more human sacrifices. 200 will walk the thousand steps Into the fire of everlasting life. I have spoken! King Cobra! King Cobra! King Cobra! King Cobra! - Guard, tell this stranger who I am. - He Martok. Lawmaker. Next chief man to high priestess. - Well. - Go. I will call you when I need you. So you are the brave one. - The brave one? - Yes. I was curious to see the man who defied our laws and laughed at our faith. - You must have come here for some other reason besides just curiosity. Tell me, why am I in prison? - For many reasons. Because you were found on this island, because you bathed in the sacred pool, You profaned the person of the high priestess by your touch, Violated her lips with your kiss. Each of these is a crime punishable by death. - That's four times I die. Too bad I only have one life, isn't it? Well, I plead guilty to the first two, but you're wrong on the others. - Wrong? - Yeah, I had a perfect right to kiss the lady in the pool And she had a right to kiss me. - She-- - Certainly. And she liked it-- Why not? We're going to be married. - You are insane. She is the high priestess and is to marry me. - Now one of us is mixed up. I'm sure the royal lady herself knows the answer. - The high priestess knows everything. - I'd like to meet her. - You will not. She does not witness executions. - I'm looking for the high priestess. - Why, that's Martok's robe! And his cobra sword! - Yes, I borrowed them. Handy little thing. When I passed the guards, they all bowed without looking to see who was carrying it. Will you tell the high priestess the stranger from the pool would like to see her? - Follow me. - The stranger who was at the pool wants to see you. - Ask him to come in. Well. You have changed clothes. - Yes, I change clothes and places with Martok. - Where is he? - He's in prison. - I'd like to see that. He must be lost without this. - Who are you? - The woman you met at the pool. - 1 know. Martok said you were the high priestess. - 1 am whoever you want me to be. - I wish you were. - But 1 am. I have always been. I always will be. - You are her in everything but- - In everything. The eyes of love are sharp, but they can be deceived. The lips never. You kissed me at the pool, remember? - Yes. - You knew me then. - I thought I did. - And you know me now. Look at me. Look deep. The same, I tell you. The same me. You're afraid. Afraid to trust your eyes, your lips. - What's my name? - Ramu. - Thy people shall be my people? - Of course. Forever. - Sisters. - I have no sister. - Where is she? - I told you, I have no sister. - And I tell you, she's on this island. I followed her here and I'm not going to leave without her. - You are not going to leave at all. Look. I'll show you. Into the fire of everlasting life they go. How would you like to see your lady love go with them? Call out the entire guard. Search the island for a woman, a beautiful young woman. She must be found! - You can't do this! - Of course I can. I am the law here. But there is an alternative. - Yes? - The lady gets safe conduct off the island and a boat to take Her back where she belongs, but she goes alone. You remain. I have spoken. Go. - Stranger. High priestess send him to prison tower. - Queen want him? - You brought the stranger? Have him come in. Thank you, Hava. I'm afraid you found an unfriendly welcome on our island, But a law older than we are prohibits strangers here. - I got more or less what I expected. May I ask who you are and why you're so friendly? - I am queen of the island and I am friendly because Of two people who need a friend badly right now. You and my granddaughter Tollea. - She's your-- - Yes. Twin sister of the cruel, vicious ruler of our people. - Twin sister! - I had Tollea brought here. By right of birth, she's the natural ruler here. - Tollea? - Yes. - Take your little friend and go back home. Leave Tollea here with us, for the sake of thousands of souls Whose need of her is greater than yours. - But, but these people mean nothing to me. - They're human lives. - But why should I-- - You hear that? That's the fire death hymn. Men and women unable to contribute to a gold-greedy ruler Are forced to walk the thousand steps to be thrown alive into the fire. - Yes, 1 saw them. Is that a part of the cobra religion? - No, that's a punishment devised by Martok and Naja. - She says die and they go without question? - The cobra ritual appeals to their emotions. That's how she holds them. - Can't you do anything about it? - I'm trying- That's why I brought Tollea back. In your hands rests the fate of the condemned, as well as all the hundreds who will follow them. - In mine? - Yes. I'm asking you to leave Tollea here with us. As ruler, she can stop this hateful slaughter. - Where is she? - You shall see her at once. Please strike that cymbal. Hava, take the stranger to the temple ruins. Go by the tunnel. No decision will be forced on you, young man, But I'll be praying that you make the right one. - Thank you. And goodbye. - Hey, Ramu! Wake up! I find Tollea. She safe. Is that nice? I run all night, Climb trees, just to get you out of this place and now you snore at me. Stop that. Oh, I got feet blisters. You got sleep sickness. All the time I have to get you out of your troubles. You should be glad you have a friend like me. - Guard! - Let me go! - Guard! - Let me go! - Now then, once more, where is the girl? - 1 don't know. - We have ways of punishing little boys who do not tell the truth. - I tell truth. Father Paul learn me. "Be good, tell truth, nobody hurt you," he say. - Father Paul was right. Now if you tell me the truth, I will let you go. _ Okay -. - Now that's better. Now where is your friend? - 1 don't know. I came to prison to see him. You think I go there if I know he move away? I find him there locked up in my friend's place. Considerable mad. - He is probably with the girl. Where is she? - I look for her again, get lost. - Well then, you have seen her? - Oh yes. She was glad to see me also. - Do you think you could find the place again if these men went with you? - Oh no. They get lost. I get lost. Very useless. - Take him to the tree. When his memory improves, cut him down and bring him back. - And everything will be just as we planned. Wherever we are, we'll always belong to each other. Always. - Yes, wherever we are. - And we can make all our plans And dreams come true, can't we, Ramu? - Yes, all of them. - And you can have a big new boat. And I can go with you every single day. And that way, we'll never be separated at all. - What happened, Hava? - Kado! - Hava say boy suffer tree torture. Tree torture? - Hands tie high on tree, feet tie on ground. Tree stand up, stretch little fella. - I are no little fella no more. - You feel better? - I are okay. - Good. Tell me, is there a way off the island besides the high cliff? - Oh yes. Cove where shell boats and cobra boats go to sea. - How do I find it? - You take Tollea? - No. No, only my friend. - Oh, but you'll be caught by guards. Every way watched. You be killed without mercy. - We'll keep out of the way. My boat's anchored right under the cliff. Now, if I can get to the beach-- - Well, outside you find stream. Follow stream through swamp. Through swamp you see beach. Oh, but, please, not through village. - I understand, Veeda. And Thanks. Goodbye, Hava. Come on, Kado. - Where we go now? - Home. - Home? Good. I get my blow pipe. - Never mind that-- Come on. - Yes? - Little boy gone from tree. - And the guard? - Dead. - Get out. Both gone. - I don't like it. I don't like it at all. - At least they can never leave the island. - They must be found. - Anxious to see the handsome young stranger again? - Yes. To see him executed And the girl to watch him die. - That's better. You know I love you, Naja. I want to marry you at once and take you away to live In the world outside as we planned. - But we must have the queen's consent. It is the cobra law. - Show her you make the laws here. Go to see the queen. Tell her to announce our marriage at once in the temple. - I tell you, she'll never agree. - Tell her you have decided. Why should we wait? - We won't wait. - 1 have decided to marry Martok and 1 demand your consent. - And I too have made a decision, That you abdicate at once. - Abdicate? - In favor of your sister, the rightful ruler. - I have no-- - Where is she? - Right here on this island. - You don't believe that? - Certainly not. It's some wild dream of her decaying brain. - She will become ruler 24 hours from now. - So. You have it all arranged? - Yes, including a boat to take you both off the island. For your own safety. - Our own safety? Do you hear that, Martok? She seems to forget I am the high priestess. I'll show you who rules here. Double the guards. I want every inch of the island searched until the girl And the strangers are found. No food or sleep for the guards until they have been brought in. I have spoken. Go. - You should sleep well, holy garland of the moon. You have had a happy birthday. - Yes, I'm grateful. But each birthday finds life's candle burning a little lower. - You're tired, my queen. - It's more than that. My heart is deep in shadow. Cold shadow. - Shall, shall I stay here with you? - No, run along. I'll be all right. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Why don't you strike, Martok? - Tell me where the sister of Naja hides If you wish to live to see another dawn. - Another dawn is not too bright a prospect. - Tell or die. - Never. Strike. You have gained nothing by this, Martok. My plans will proceed without me. You can never marry Naja. - A dead queen cannot oppose it. - King Cobra knows. Fire mountain knows. - Fire mountain. - Through your hands, They destroyed me for disobedience. But I endow you with the memory of what you've done to live with your-- Every moment until you Follow me. - You're very beautiful this morning, Your Highness. - Thank you. What's that? - I'll see. They've caught the strangers! - Good. Bring my ceremonial robe. - Ramu? - Soldiers bring him back to die. - And Kado? - Little fellow, too. - Is there any way I can help? - Would you take great risk for them? - Yes, yes, anything. - Follow me. - I want that cobra jewel! - The cobra jewel belongs to the high priestess. Who are you? - 1 am your sister. Can you look at me and deny it? And I am here to take my place as high priestess. - I rule here. - No, I, the first-born, am the rightful ruler. And I'm going to stop all this human slaughter and bring peace to my people. - The people know the price of peace. Fire mountain cries for more human sacrifices. Young girls, young men, children, all must go! - NO- No more of that ever. - Martok! Guards! - There's no one to answer. They have all gone to the temple to pray to a mountain you taught them to fear. Give me that cobra jewel. - You'll have to kill me first. - Put that down. - Don't you dare come a step nearer! - 1 have brought you here to witness a public execution. 1, Martok, Enforcer of the law, Demand that these two strangers shall die in the manner devised by me And prescribed by our island custom. Their presence here is a sacrilege. Fire mountain rumbles in protest and cries for vengeance! So by the power vested in me, 1 sentence them to death. Guards, proceed with the execution. ' Stop! - It is Tollea. - No, no, it can't be. - I tell you yes. I see other one, too. Pretty like Tollea, with mean face. - I forbid this execution. - The enforcement of law is my concern, religion is yours. - Useless murder is no part of our law. - I thought you wanted to see him die. - I have spoken. - Where is the cobra jewel? You aren't Naja. - I am the ruler of this island. Thy people shall by my people. - It is Tollea. - I never wrong sometime. - We shall see. King Cobra! King Cobra! - He killed King Cobra! - Fire mountain! - Martok dead. Fire mountain no longer angry with us. Cruelty and oppression ended here forever. We all now free to live and believe as we please under rule of our rightful queen Tollea. - You got sad sickness for Tollea, huh? - Yeah, I got sad sickness for Tollea. - Tollea! - Ramu! - How could you leave the island? - Hava and Veeda will guide them wisely. - But they're your people. - Thy people shall be my people. ♪ Near or far ♪ ♪ We'll be where you are ♪ ♪ When you call ♪ ♪ You'll find us there beside you ♪
