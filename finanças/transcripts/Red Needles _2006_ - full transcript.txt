And now a news flash. Eight soldiers have been killed in an ambush in northern Algeria. Their patrol vehicle?. Hey! Are you out ofyour minds? Move! Red Needle Tuesday, September 20, 1960 - First Day This crap could put your eye out. The Eagle pack clearly needs to let offsteam. That's good. They can dojustthat on the trek I've planned. Know the Brevent? Yes, chief. 8,284feet, opposite Mont Blanc, 1 3,123 feet. Good. You'll climb itfrom Chamonix. On foot? No, on a flying carpet. Today, a seven-mile hike. A night atthe presbytery and, at dawn, you'll set offto climb... Brevent. Good, you're following. Atthe top, you'll sleep atthe refuge with the Panthers who don't really need to wear uniforms to breakfast. You'll bivouac together in the Aiguilles Roughes reserve. Patrick. No bullshitfor 3 days, can you manage that? Justto see those Pantherjerks. Why am I even here? I ask myselfthattoo. You can't put a coin on a track, so belt up. Hey, it wasn't my coin. Dick. Mail, lads. Luc. lf it's sweets, give me some. Tsetse. My parents must be bored stiff to write every day. Your brother? Who d'you think? Still nothing for me? Sure... A knee in the balls. Hey, Bitoun..ls that Jewish? Are you nuts? How many miles to the Brevent? You talk in hours of hiking. We get an afternoon in Chamonix. Can we go to see my sister skate? We'll change first. Why? Ashamed ofyourfancy uniform? I bet we'll find some firns. What are firns? Patches ofeternal snow. Great, we'll be able to ski. Hurry it up, lads. C'mon Jean Pierre. I didn't have any mail either. Yourfamily's on holiday in Chamonix. They'd be dumb to write. Tataf Present. Getthat uniform off. Hurry. What's your sister's name? lsabelle. Myriam. Yum yum... You only smile to clean yourteeth. Hands off! Lend me your comic. Come on. No. My dear Patrick, our correspondence is like an appointment I waitfor and dread. I'm afraid I'll disappoint you. I like Camus a lottoo. I've already read ''The Stranger'' and ''The Rebel''. I think that if men knew what death is, they'd be less eagerfortheir peers to experience such hideous loss. Look! lsabelle. Your sister's the queen ofskating. Will you be back forthe fete? There'll be fireworks. We're not here to have fun, you know. The cinema. How much for your hat? Cut it out. ''The 400 Blows'' I love it when he nicks the typewriter. Hey, lads. I'd be an actor to bang chicks like her. Can't you read? Banned to under-16s. What are you doing? You know my mum's expecting a new baby? His name'll be... Denis. Never repeat yourself, do you? Your mum swallowed a record stylus when she was pregnant. I fancy a choux bun. Me too. You don't understand. Having resumed the reins of France, I have, as you know, decided in her name to take a new path. This path no longer leads to the governing ofAlgeria... from mainland France. Butto an Algerian Algeria. How aboutthat... He's going to start crying. The destiny and responsibilities ofAlgeria will be in Algerian hands. He can't give Algeria to the wogs. Got a problem with Arabs? Shut it, you Commie. I'm sick ofyour crap. You don'tthink my brother's sick of2 years ofthat shit? That's enough. Screw it. Want my fist in yourface? I'm sick offighting. Jew, Arab, same difference. What is it? Why wear dark glasses all the time? To show off. I got our baby brother something. Just watch the screen. What're you doing? Ogling. All the chicks here, they make my nuts go mushy. 15... Maybe... 13... 16... Zero, moron. She could be your mum. She looks a bit uptighttoo. I guess. 2... You're being mean. 4... 19... 3l4 Thank you. You're welcome. Thatfilm was crap. I often remember our holiday in La Ciotat 3 years ago. I was sure I'd never know such happy times again. When you left, you said goodbye with 2 quick kisses. That innocent gesture seemed both awful and wonde_ul. I am much harder now. And the way I rejectflirts scares me attimes. You wantto be a photographer? I'd like to be a special correspondent. Growing up, Patrick, means making childhood dreams come true. So let's dream while you take lots of photos... for later... Wednesday, September 21 ,1960 - 2nd day. Let's get going. See you wimps. Screw you, dickhead. We'll wipe you out up there. lfyou make it. Are you ready? Let's go. Where do spuds grow? ln fields, like noodles. Noodles grow in fields? Ever see that, you spud? lf I'm a spud, you're real noodle. See that glacier? Fall in and you come out 50 years later. I know. The ice takes up to 40 years to descend. You'll end up a teacher. A priest, the way he looks. A rabbi, you mean. Believers. There is but one God. Demand the real one. Will you miss school? I have no choice. The marketfish stall with my parents. How about you? I'm going to high school. I wish I hadn't passed that exam now. I failed firsttime round. What's up? My tooth. It had me awake all night. Wantthis? No thanks. lt must be freezing up there. Don't worry, yourfat'll keep you warm. Think my little brother will be born in the mountains? Maybe it's not a boy. I know it is, okay. I'm really into the country. Dad takes me every Sunday... in his citroen ds with hydraulic suspension. Your dad had a ds? I doubt it. Why? A worker can't afford it. What do you know, toffee-nose? Look! A seagull. Where? There. You must be good at biology. Dumbo. That's an eagle. Like us. We are not much like him. I'd be happier with him guiding us. Oh, yeah. 50 steps at a walk, 50 at a run. Let's go. Doesn't he seem a bit mixed-up lately? Let's go. My father keeps telling people... as ifobsessed, there'll never be another war. I'm speechless each time. When I show him the headlines, he says, that's totally different. Besides, it doesn't concern girls. That's right, France is at war and my father acts as if he didn't know. Or perhaps he doesn't care. Sometimes I fell I have no choice. I have to leave this home. You'll see me turn up one day, my little case in my hand. - Wantto take a break? - Yeah. Come on. I'll go on ahead. The flora here is magnificent. Always showing off. Are you ever nice? ls there an age to kiss a girl? How do you mean? lfyou haven't kissed a girl before 20, is that normal? Don't worry about it, you have time. lt's Adrien... Your brother? He's got a hang-up about it. The jerk wants to desert. To end up in jail? Or caught by the Fellaghas and that's no holiday. The Algerian smile... To create God, dumbo, there had to be another God. God couldn't create himself. What's he saying? I'll definitely never be a priest. Here... They leftthe communion wine. Vomitous. It's turned to vinegar. No, tatave! Don't. Holy water is water with God diluted in it. Move your ass, comrade, or I'll kick your bloody behind. Move it. I didn'tthink you'd leave me in peace. I thought something was up... that you were sick. You've put my mind at rest. Move it. Patrick, my bootlace. I'll see to it, Dumbo ls ittrue Tatave's dad has a ds? Maybe in his dreams, tatave's dad died 2 years ago. Wow...I didn't know. Keep thatto yourself. Hey, lads. It might rain. Who is Myriam to you exactly? Myriam? She's my friend. My ideal woman. My ideal woman. Cutthe crap. ls Isabelle a friend too? lsabelle? Hold on, that's notthe same thing. Myriam..she's bright, she's magical... Bollocks. How can a guy love one girl and flirt with another? Flirt? Yeah. So you marry some girls, and sleep with others? I don't give a damn about Isabelle. Try a new approach and it may work. - Gimme that. - My biscuits. Here, Tsetse. Shit, you're red! Going to explode or what? No more radio. The batteries are dead. Want one? Why doesn't Isabelle love me? What? She doesn't love me, I know. That's way I'm glad to be having a brother. I hope he'll love me at least. Got any brothers and sisters? My father would have wanted other children but... my mother wasn't keen. Wow... Do you know why? lt's since I was born. She hates being touched. I bet Isabelle likes you. And I bet she loves you. Even ifshe acts all proud with Patrick. Tatave. Present. Dear brother, I'm making the most ofa moment's peace to send you, with all my love... You know, here... Hoping to see you all soon. And hold you in my arms You know, I've got muscles now. From running around the mountains like this. To see you all soon. And hold you. Tatave Present. Stop saying ''present'' it's a pain. Make you mind up. ean-Pierre said I'd get my ass kicked 10 times if I didn't say it. lf he can't piss anyone off he pisses himselfoff. I'll headbutt you in our shitty face. What a stink. Jesus, a giant blister. Can I go to hospital? Any other blisters? Yes, me. Let's go. Hand it over. I'll see to it. Give me a break. Those must be the Aiguilles Rouges. He doesn't know where he's going. And we follow likejerks. He knows what he's doing. Ittakes brains to be a patrol leader, right, Tatave? I needed 14 years, 3 weeks and 5 days to admit 1+1 is 2, so patrol leader... Don't you believe anything? People talk rubbish. So I've found the solution. I don't believe anything I'm never disappointed. All the same, all this beauty is.. It has to be God's work. Your blister. No, my feet are okay. lt's my legs now. My thighs nem, then total paralysis. lfonly it could get as far as his mouth. Why are you in a reform home? You know that? Everyone knows. I was a kleptomaniac. What's that? ls it serious? Someone who steals all the time. ln shops, grocery store, at school... I stole anything. I couldn't stop myself. Wow...ls there a cure. I worked with a psychologist. What's that? He helps figure out why you do weird things. And you know now? We're supposed to be on holiday... With 19 and warm in bed... She could be the mother of my kids... I don't even have her phone number. You think I stand any chance at all with her? Mature women don't always like virgins. Are you crazy? I've had truckloads ofchicks before. Shut your mouth. What's this? The cable-car station, bombed out. Hey, this isn't Algeria though. Shut it. lt's not just our brother. I have my whole family there. Oh yeah? This must be the old station. The new one can't be far away. lt can't be the glacier... Cant' be? Just an hourto the refuge. How do you know that? lt'll take us 4 hours to turn back I getthe message. I don't wantto end up lost in the dark. We are not lost. We soon will be. We'll find the Brevent by flashlight? You really need to piss me off, huh? Let's get going. Piss off! You bastard. Who the hell is he, giving us orders. Patrick, I'm coming. Bruno. Eric, waitfor me. Oh, hell... Finished your stunts? Yeah. You have the food. You can't let us starve. ls the refuge far now. Shut up, midget, and get climbing. - Give me our hand, Dumbo, I'll guide you. - Dumbo. I'm slipping... - Dumbo. - My shoulder. OK? Gently... Are you ok? Let's go. Watch your step. Hurry, it'll be dark in an hour. Hey, Bruno, Mars must be like this, right? By the year 2000, we'll be able to go there by rocket. Justthink, we'll be 54 by then. We'll be pot-bellied wrecks with loads of kids. Speak for yourself. I can't waitforthe year 2000. Think we'll still be friends? You bet. We'll make a vow. What vow? To be togetherto see in the year 2000 whatever. lfyou want. Where? On Mars, ofcourse. There's nothing here. The Gobi Desert on top of Kilimnajaro. I don't get it. We climbed up here forzilch. I knew we should have turned back. We're buggered. Shit Could we sleep in there? Yeah, ifwe can break the door down. So where's your crap refuge? Hey, I'm in the shit as much as you are. The leader really screwed us. Sleep in the summit refuge. Where are the Pantherjerks? They are smart, they headed back down. So do we die now or wait a little? Look here, your cheap irony is pissing me off. I'm sick of it. Look at all these stones. My shoulder...I wantto cry. So cry, damn it, and stop pissing us off. Let's head back the way we came. How'll you do it in the dark, dickhead? Don'ttalk to me like a dog. Open, damn you. Here, Bruno. Thanks. Hey, look atthis. We'rejust checking it out, Ok. Yeah. Sweets! I'lljust stock up. Sun cream. Why are you paying? Lads, come and see. Clock the titties. Lovely boobs. What? Boobies, knocker, mams, bazoomas, bumpers... And I thought you only liked food. Do you prefer brunettes or blondes? Redheads, like you. What's that village? Servoz. It can't be far. Well? They're raiding the place. What? You bet. You'll be in for it. I did nothing. Move! Have you got mush for brains? Are you stupid? Think no one will connect us to that? That settles it. We have to leave. Listen to me. Clean this place up atthe double. Then let's get out of here. Move it. Come one. Well done. Happy now? Know what? No... We'll head down to Servoz, the nearest village. lt'll take an hour ortwo. Read that in a comic book? I don't wantto end up in a cell because ofyour bullshit. We didn't rob a bank. True. You can talk. A repeat offender. lfwe're caught, you'll get it. Why me? I stole nothing. I just wanted a nap. We don't have a record. They'll blame you. - Not Christian butthat's how it is. - Servoz, here we come. Come on. Thanks, Patrick. Think the cops will arrest us? Maybe they'll think it was a bear. There are bears here? lf my dad finds out, he'll lock me up forthe nem 5 years. That's all? Mine will kill me. He's that strict? You bet. He's a high school chiefsupervisor. What does yours do? He was in real estate. And now? He can't work since we arrived in France. Freaking out, Dumbo. With all the animals around, eagles, bears, spider... You bet I'm freaking out. There are dahus too. What are dahus? Tiny animals whose right legs are shorter and the left legs to run on the mountainside. How do they turn around? That's right. How? lt's simple actually. They neverturn around. They keep going in the same direction. Like a clock's hands. So what scares you? I don't know. I've never really thought about it. Loneliness maybe. My dad, he tries to scare me but it doesn't work for some reason. I'm scared for mine, I'm scared ofstinking offish around the clock. Like my parents. Luc, know hat a generator's for? ltturns mechanical energy into electricity. And with a copper coil, you can produce current. Does it hurt a lot? When it's used fortorture, yeah, it hurts a lot. Even with my specs, I'm blind here. Hold on, lads. We'll rope up. You see, Eric, they call that solidarity. When one falls, everyone tumbles. Got nothing more absurd? Got anymore crap comments, you two? Go ahead,justtry me and see. Yes, sarge. Be careful. Patrick. Let's cutthe crap fortonight. Settle down here. We'll waitfor daylightto move on. You're lucky to live in Paris. To feel less isolated in this petty bourgeois town, I buy the communist daily paper. I don't really understand it all yet. I think politics should reduce inequality ratherthan increase it. I know you'll agree with me there. lf my fatherfinds the paper, he'll murder me. My mother suspects something... but since she doesn't want my demise, she'll keep the secret. Last week, she pulled outthe stops to return me to the right path. She bought me new shoes. To be hones, I love them. She has no self-respect but she has taste. Thursday, September 22,1960 - 3rd day. What's up, Dumbo? Had a nightmare? Know why dreams were invented? To scare me. No. So we don't get bored while we sleep. My dream is to cook an egg underthe Arc de Triomphe. How much to cutthe crap? 6 O'clock! Are you sadists or what? I didn't sleep a wink. What do we do now? We turn back. You getto decide now? We pack our gear and head down to Servoz. I'm shivering... Damn...Ask your maid to make you some hot cocoa. What? Chin up, Dumbo. Look atthe sun. lt'll soon warm us up. Why isn'tthe damn sun shining here? Because we're on the ubac. Because we're on the ubac. The slope hidden from the sun. The adret is in full sunlight. How do you know all that? I got bored easily so I read a lot. When I get bore, I don't read, I waitfor itto pass. Does it? No. We can't go any further. We'll turn back to find the way. I'm fucking sick ofthis. I'm not going back. Let's make 2 groups. We'll stand twice as much chance. How will we meet up again? We'll use whistles to communicate in Morse. All Ok. Danger. OK. Go with Eric, Guy and Bruno. We'll meet back here if it doesn't work. Oh, yeah. And what do we get? A candy bar? A John Wayne movie? Ifwe make it. Shut it. Save itfor later. Come on. Waitfor us. What? Which way did you go? I can't remember. That way. We're stuck. We'll see you further down. No, go to the right. You think so? Sure. You bet. Waitfor me. I'm slipping... Dumbo. Are you ok, Dumbo? Grab my mitt. Hold you hand out. What'll they call your little brother? Denis? Denis? What if Denis could see you now? He can't see me. He hasn't even been born. When I tell him what ajerk you were.. How you couldn't hold your hand out. You haven't even shown me his present. lt's a tiny silver spoon. Eric. What? lt's too tough for me. So go back up. I'm carrying on. Don't be so pig-headed. You can see it's impossible. Jean-Pierre, try going that way. Bloody hell, I'm fucking sick ofthis. Those assholes teach us to find directions with compasses orthe stars. Really useful system in the mountains. And I getthe dirty linen. Don't wash it in public. Pain in the ass. I'm sick of it. Come on. Let's head back up to meetthem. Wise decision. Worthy ofa great leader. That's nasty sunburn. I'm cold, I'm freezing. Putthis on. Come on. We're nearly there. Help! Help me! lsn't Eric with you? No. He wouldn't listen. Eric. Eric. Eric. What's thejerk doing? Eric. We have to go. And leave him? Bruno's in a bad way, Dumbo's wiped out. As for Jean-Pierre... We have to go. But what about Eric? Don't worry. He'll manage. He's so stubborn, he took another path. We have to get going. Every man to himself. Got a better idea? Know what? You take over and get us out ofthis. I've had enough. My pack. We waittill Dumbo and Bruno can't move? Afterthat, will you carry them back up? We're out offood, we're freezing... We're going back up. Let's dry offwhile we waitfor Eric. Ok, let's go. Maybe Eric's with the Panthers. Weren't we meeting the Panthers here? Abouttime. I was beat. Tatave Present. This is the last of it. Thanks Luc. Thanks. We'll starve to death. No, Eric has the food. He'll be here soon. Aren't you sick of playing the trusty scout? I thought I had some choc left. Holy cow, you've got your period. What's a period? Actually, once a moth, girls piss blood. They piss blood? That's vomitous. lt's nature. They can be in love all the same. Ask the great Manitou for a light. And something to eattoo. I wouldn't mind a thick bison sandwich. 30 francs an hour. But keep it shut. New francs or old? Calm down. I told you notto do it. It's made him mad. Ok, Dumbo? Peeing in afont is a sin. You piss in a font? He'll have to admit it in confession. Tell me why we always obey orders. We haven't been drafted. Go there, and we go. Do this, and we do it. My brother's sick ofobeying orders. You've no idea whatthey tell him to do. lt's only normal he should feel like deserting. Adrien and I are nothing alike. Our grandparents raised us. lt's only natural. I want you to read it. And the others too. You've no idea whatthey tell him to do. He's never kissed a girl and he has to slaughter rebels. Ok, Jean-Pierre? The letter...Don't show itto Dumbo, ok? You know, Adrien, he wouldn't have hurt a fly. Here, wipe yourface. What? - Eric. - Eric. - Eric. - Eric. Eric. Eric. Eric. Eric. Eric. - Eric. - Eric. Eric. Eric. You should stay with the others. No, I'm coming with you. lt's not a good idea. Maybe but it's the only one I have. With Erick lost and a storm coming, we can'tjust sit here. We'll all come with you. Dumbo, it's 3 hours to Les Houches. Waitforthe storm to blow over and we'll fetch help. Cheer up. Luc. What? Can I have anothertablet? There's only one left. And it's for Bruno. Jean-Pierre's right. When my dad talks aboutthe war, it's like being there. Unlike us, ourfolks knew it. Well, not all ofthem. Mine did. What's on your mind, Dumbo? Not even a dry place to sit. I don't care. I'll love a little sistertoo. How old is your sister? She hasn't been born yet. No, stupid, the other. lsa, 16 112. Born in 1944, then. Dad says you watch girls from 1944, you never know who their dads are. Your dad's dead. Eric. Eric. Eric. We're going crazy. We're going to die. No, Dumbo. The lightning struck so the storm will move on. lncredible. The sly devil keptthe batteries. I put back all the chocs. First, keep out of my pack. And second, I paid. Screw the batteries. With the chocs, we would't be starving. Shut it, you damn thief. Watch it, you goddam religious bigot. You're out ofyour mind. Guy help me. Let's light a fire for Bruno. Putthat down. My magazine. Jean-Pierre... Are you ok? You've had a dump? No. Why? Something stinks. Tatave, cheer us up with a daft remark. Our Fatherthat art in heaven, stay there, we're in the shit. Their crap methods never work. A miracle. Tsetse, you can warm yourfeet now. And keep your nuts warm. I knew it. You're not cured at all. Slow... A night atthe refuge, then the ridge walk. The Brevent refuge has been closed for ages now. He should have known. But it's on the map. ln the early evening...Sarrazin, in the early evening. You reached the top ofthe Brevent? Save them. Chief? Fetch my dog. When you saw you had no shelter, why didn't you follow the planned route? That's right. Why go to Servoz? Night was falling so... We were drawn to the lights. You headed down to the gorge, as far as the cliffs? Yes, almost. We turned back and... Rosset. Enough! Stop sniggering and answerthe questions. Look atthis asshole... Ok, stand up. Stand up, you moron. Enough ofthis bullshit. You'll get worse ifthe parents press charges. And in their shoes, that's what I'd do. I had 2 patrols up there. One turned back so I thought Patrick would too. Sure. My grandad's taking a train here. How did he know? No idea. I'll need your pal's shirt or socks. Something with his smell. ln my pack. The dirty linen is some us at last. Friday, September 23,1960 - 4th day lfyou wantto be happy, Patrick, learn to lighten up. I find you a little too serious. Life may be worth nothing but nothing is worth life. I'm almost a woman and my father sees that as a serious failing. Some days, I look at my mother and it really scares me. I'm going to leave this place. We can't wake Bruno. - Tatave. - Jean-Pierre. Come on. This way? Yeah. We tried down there but got nowhere. I'll rope you to me. You others, spread out 50 yards on each side. What's a cropper? lt means an accident, serious or otherwise. And the pole? The pole? Routine to bring a body back if need be. Ok, Max, let's go. The rescue team. Well? Nothing on this side. He can't be lower down. Or he fell in the Diosaz, in that case... We'll search higher up. He may be trapped in a ravine. We'll head up on the left. Take Max with you. Ok, chief. Shall we go? Wantto take a break? No. We'll take one anyway. I should feel safer with you, but I feel the opposite. That's because you're aware ofthe danger at last, kid. Eric wanted to turn back. We argued all the way up and I insisted on carrying on. Sometimes, you get it wrong. Are you even listening to me? lf he dies, it'll be my fault. How did I know what was right? They send us up here likejerks. Are you listening to me? Take this. I'm listening. You can't understand. You never get angry. I'll tell you something, kid. lfyour pals followed you this far, they got itjust as wrong as you did. They were under my responsibility. You can always say no. When an order's absurd, saying no... is a brave act. You can come in now. Ok? Luckily, they made a fire. It counteracted the hypothermia. lmpressive abscess. I'm fine butthey won't let me out. Half-frozen, that's fine? Hello. Oh shit! A sprained shoulder's nothing. And you, dimwit? Pneumonia, dead any day now. Chicken, it'sjust a cold. Chicken. Chicken... Are you ok? The fever's fallen... Any news of Eric? I'm cold. Don't worry, kid, we'll find your pal. Right. Max? We'll find his pal. Why not check the other side? You can't getthrough the gorge. You don't know Eric. He'll stop at nothing to be right. Yes, Max. Come and see, kid. An animal must have got in. A dahu, I reckon. A whole group ofdahus even. They're mischievous beasts. Especially the younger ones. Right...we can'tfile a complaint against dahus. That'd be absurd. Right, kid? You can stop calling me that. Let's go. I'm sick of it. You can't eat anymore? No. Holy cow. Double. What? Double too. Ask your sister what she thinks. Tatave. Present. I'd like you to be my sister Sophie's godfather. You lucky devil. I'll go and see Mum. See you later. Playing or not? Why let Eric go offalone? From the very start, he hadjust one idea. Heading back down. Maybe to see you again. Do my Algerian origins or nasty temper make me so rebellious? But young people here should rise up too. As soon as your mother heard, she put me on a train. Why didn't she come? She's tired. She can't get used to life here. She's always cold, even in summer. How about you? Are you ok? lt's beautiful, isn't it, Dad? Yes, it's beautiful. Very beautiful. Butthe mountains can trick you. lt's notjustthe mountains thattrick you. De Gaulle is dumping us. Algeria's overfor us. Saturday, September 24, 1960 5th and final day. Where is my son? Where is my son? Sir, please follow me. Come this way, please 30 men are out looking for him, butthe weather conditions are poor. But have you found him? No, we haven't. That's impossible. There are 30 men... Almost... Yourturn... - Got it. - Good. Four. Here, it's yourturn. What's the matter? We'll never go back to Algeria. That's tough. The eight dead soldiers are brought back to France. We found this in the gorge. You recognize all this? Eric's? Ofcourse they'll find him. Don'tfret. Don't worry. You know your son. As stubborn as his mother. I'll call you later. Take care. Looks like Napaleon. I heard he was back around here. I see something overthere. He gotthrough the gorge? Granddad. You had a goodjourney? You're here. Thank you. Excuse me. Jean-Pierre... I have some bad news. You were almostthe death of us, kid. You're crazy? What's the matter? What's your name? My name's Adrien. Well...Goodbye, Adrien. Mum Darling. Everything's fine. I'm here. I'll leave you with this question. What is friendship for you? While I await your reply, I send you all my affection, hoping to have a long letter and photos from you soon. I embrace you with all my heart. Myriam. There, dear Myriam, my adventure with the Eagles. Eric was lucky. He got out ofthe gorge and, although injured, gotto the other side... where the rescue team could spot him. Dumbo wants to be a patrol leader. Afterthe camp, Tatave was hired as a bellboy atthe Grand Hotel. Luc and his parents moved down south, nearthe Mediterranean. Guy went back to his studies to be a dentist or a confectioner. Bruno works in his parent's fish shop. After his brother was killed in Algeria, Jean-Pierrejoined the Trotskyites. As for me... Here they are. Who gave me these hoodlums? Get back to your beds and make it snappy. Move it. One last one... You asked whatfriendship is. I have a lot of pals... But I only have one friend. You. I hope we'll grow old saying we made the right choices... and that you'll always be my friend.
