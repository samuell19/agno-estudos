EVOLUTION Nicolas! - There's a dead boy! - Did you go out? He's underwater. Have you been swimming? His eyes are horrible! The sea makes you think all kinds of things. Don't do it again, you could have drowned. There was a star on his belly. A starfish? Yes, a red one, this big. Nicolas! We're going to bury it. Coming? I saw a dead body. It's in the water. Where in the water? In the sea. Liar! He's scared! We'll bury it here. Time for your medicine. One, two, three, four. Why am I sick? Because at your age your body is changing and weakening. Like lizards? In a way. Like lizards or crabs. When they molt, they're very fragile. And starfish? They only change once, at birth. And afterwards? Afterwards... A new cycle begins. A new life. Drink up. You frightened me before. Where did you go swimming? There never was any drowned boy. Nicolas! You're a good boy. Nicolas! See its mouth? It's scary. You're scared of this? Coward! Frank! Stop that! Coward! You'll stay here overnight. It won't be long. What will you do to me? An injection. It's nothing for a big boy like you. Your mother tells me you draw a lot. Yes. What do you draw? Animals. Starfish. Am I going to die? Hang your clothes there. You can't shower dressed. I can do it myself. 66. It'll be more fun together. Come on! What's that? I'd love to see your drawings. I can keep a secret. Thank you. It's beautiful. I'll count 10 and it'll be over. One, two, Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, Ten. Look, what they did to me. They did it to us all. Are we all sick? Where are you going? Don't you want to come home? Victor! Victor! Victor! Are you coming? - Where? - They're lying to us. Let's see what they do at night. Are you coming? We're going to get lost. No, we're not. Come on! How long do we have to stay here? They're lying. We won't get better. Where's Victor? Look what I have for you. What's that? A Ferris wheel. And what does this wheel do? You get on it and it spins around. Children! I have good news. Your friend Victor has been cured. He sent you this. More! What are you doing? Do you want them to force-feed you? Give me that! Give me that! Get back into bed! Obey me! Obey your mother! You're not my mother! Nicolas... Nicolas! They took them all. You know, my mother's not my mother either. Here. Shall we draw? You don't draw? Show me. Draw something. Shall I tell you a secret? Yes. Can you feel it? Yes. Here he is! Stella! Come back! Stella!
