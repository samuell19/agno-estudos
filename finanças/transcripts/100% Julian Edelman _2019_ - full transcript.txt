It's pretty straightforward... ...It's super straightforward. -That's Kyler. -Hey, Kyler. How's it going? You got a whole fucking production going on here. There is only one thing harder than reaching the top: Staying there. Now look, nobody is born with greatness. You gotta fight for it. Every single day. This is the story of Julian Edelman. Wait, what? ♪thumping rock beat♪ This is ab-- This is about Jules? ♪rolicking rock music♪ Didn't Brady already do this shit? What the fuck is this? Yeah. Who's-- Who's even paying for this? Edelman to the... cuts it up inside. Into the endzone. -Did he make the catch? -He's got it! -He did! At the 40. -You gotta be kidding me! Bring the dog over here. This is a star. You see? She ain't doing shit. She ain't saying shit until it's time. She's not trying to play football, so I don't know why Jules is trying to be in front of the camera. Alright. Just, guys, do me a favor. Don't ask me to come to the premiere. Alright? Is there -- There ain't even gonna be no fucking premiere. Where you gonna -- Where you gonna view this shit? Why are we clowning on my boy though? I love Jules. There's an old saying... If you die doing something you love, it's not tragedy. Now I didn't die... But my kn-- my ACL did. -Julian frickin' Edelman. -Let's go! Excuse me. Julian Francis Edelman, is a wide receiver for the New England Patriots. God, I hate the Patriots. But Julian Edelman is a beast. He grew up in the Bay Area in the 1990s. You know, with all the computers and shit. Meet the Edelmans. This is Angie, the mom. She ran the house. The kids, Jason, Nicki, and Julian. And that's Frank, the dad. He's a mechanic. What you gotta know about Frank is, he didn't have a dad. So, he took being one, really seriously. Jules was raised playing a ton of sports, and Frank was there coaching every minute of it. Now you see, the Super Bowls, and the rings, and all that stuff, and you think, "This guy's a natural." But I am telling you, this guy should have been living in his hometown, working in his father's garage. This kid was tiny. Wasn't recruited after high school, went to a junior college, also known as a community college. He transferred to Kent State. Not exactly Michigan. He's a short Jewish guy. Somehow, gets drafted, late, by the New England Patriots. Not as a quarterback, obviously. He returned a couple of punts. But he found a way to stick on the team and eventually worked his way into being Tom Brady's #1 guy. But that's just where this starts. Look, this is an unlikely story. I-It's about fixing what's broken. It's about family. It's about starting at zero, and getting to 100. And then doing it all over again. Welcome to downtown Detroit and to Ford Field for this week number three preseason matchup of the New England Patriots and the Detroit Lions. Brady and a gun and an empty set. He's got Gronk sliding right -- takes the shot, good snap format... Edelman runs to the 20, sliding left to 15, and he dives to the 13 yard line with a 1st down for the Patriots. -But he rolls over... -Oh, boy... ...and then he favors his right leg, if not his right foot, limping to the far sideline. Cross the linebacker's face. I catch the ball, try to get vertical, make a cut, and then all of a sudden... So, there's this thing in your knee and it's called the anterior cruciate ligament, or the ACL as everybody knows it. Now, I want you to think about it as like a rubber band that keeps everything nice and tight and ready to rock. Now, you tear this bad boy, what happens? Well, your leg is pretty much useless. Now, 20 years ago, your career would be boom, done, over. Today, not so much. Let's see. Your doctor starts by grafting a piece of the patella tendon. Then, they drill a hole in your femur and your tibia. That sounds great. Now, they throw your new ACL in, add a couple of screws, sew you back up, and you're as good as new. You know, except for, well, months of pain, recovery, rehab, and learning to walk again. Besides that, no big deal. Julian Edelman. He has to be one of the best receivers in the NFL. I'm not talking about statistics, I'm talking about his game. I mean physically, he's quick as a cat, which bugs me. Nothing like trying to catch a guy who looks like a water bug, you know, those bugs that sit on top of the of the water, and they just, scatter around. ♪hold music♪ Lightning in a bottle. That's basically what he looks like when he's running routes. And he's almost impossible to stop. I mean he really is. That's why their offense clicks when he's in the game. He's always got the underdog mentality, he's always pissed off at somebody. I don't know. Until he has the courage to line up across from me, I'm going to have to say he's a coward. He is the epitome of the Patriot way. Hard-working man who's out there achieving greatness one day at a time. It looks like he cut on it, and it was actually not contact. I thought, you know, he's tough, you know, he's going to get up and shake it off and still be in the -- in the game. To watch him, go down, and to see his face, I know what he's thinking. I was just hoping it wasn't my ACL. Um, you know, I was hoping maybe... You know, something in the back of my knee. Joker was going a thousand miles per hour, probably a little too fast. You know, making a cut that he doesn't really practice. Old Jimbo looked at me and said, um... "We gotta get an x-ray." And once he says that, I mean, they know. You know, later we got word that he had torn his -- -torn his ACL. -Julian Edelman currently -being, uh -- carted off. -You know, you can get angry. You get down 'cause you know you're not gonna... ...be in for the whole season. Um... And then you just kinda... go back, and sit in the locker room by yourself. Everyone's trying to get your hopes up, but uh... ...You know, you feel lonely. You're in a lonely spot. 'Cause as much as everything they want to say, all the things they tell you, it doesn't mean shit. I just knew it was going to be a long fucking road. ♪quiet emotional music♪ ...The latest news on Julian Edelman is the team believes that Edelman has torn his ACL. Now, the Patriots must move on without Julian Edelman. You're taking away the #1 crutch for this quarterback. Like Brady said, you gotta change in a matter of one night. We need to be different now. A lot of things have changed. We knew it was season- ending the minute it happened. He was upset and he was hurt. I mean football players like to play football. Frank is very patient. Nothing bothers him, he's easy going. He's strict, but -- but very patient. Frank was rough. Like, intense... ...um, scary. Oh, I was terrified of him. Everyone was terrified of Frank. This is my favorite thing in the world. When, um, nobody expected Julian to do anything, when he ended up going to Kent State, we went in and beat Iowa, th-- the Iowa Cyclones, the Iowa State Cyclones. We knocked them off. You know, it was like tremendous. And then after that victory, "Edelman among the nation's top players." I mean, you know what I mean? How cool was that, when, you know, uh -- it was just a cool thing for pops. Uh, Julian's relationship with Frank has... ...has gone through a lot of different changes. Well, they're the same person. They're both nuts. But that work ethic from my dad and just no excuses. Just, you know, there is no excuses, just get your stuff done. If you have an excuse, that means you're just not doing your work. I used to get on this, top of this, and I'd throw the ball and punt the ball, so I'd be as high as I could. He just had such an unconventional approach to things, but it was always about, you know, how do I make you uncomfortable? Tie the hands behind the back and make him catch six footballs at once. We did all sorts of things. People think he was a hard -- hard on him, but Jules loved it. You know, I'm running back and forth and back and forth in front of Julian and he's holding a basketball with the goofy glasses that are blocked out with duct tape. He would have his back turned and I would be in his -- He -- he'd throw the ball up over his shoulder, and I would be in his f-- you know, either slapping at him, slapping at his hand, or blocking his face. Throwing a towel in his face right when my dad throws. My dad's throwing the football as hard as he can. He would push me and I would get so pissed off. Jules starts yelling at him, "God-fucking-dammit, Dad!" He used to get so mad at me. We'd fight. It was abusive. Then we'd go home and do homework. I mean, looking back, you're like, "Damn, that's a lot." But, I wouldn't be where I'm at without it, so... I appreciate the push. Injuries suck. -I mean, it stinks. -It was devastating. It sucked, man, because, you know, he was one of our best players. They knew that they had lost not just a quality football player, but part of who they are as a team. This is not a setback, this is a setup, for me to make a comeback. That's who Julian is, man. ♪echoing guitar♪ Life is not a perfect plan. Y-- You're gonna have setbacks. And the key is, how do you deal with adversity? And there's only one way to deal with it. You just -- you look at your options, what can, and what can't I do? And you move forward. Going to the last doctor's appointment before my surgery. You still see the atrophy because in the time that the knee was swollen it doesn't allow your muscles to fire so then it turns 'em off and they go dormant for a little while. So you can definitely see my right quad is smaller than my left. Do you feel like that's normal now? The extension? Pretty much. Well, I mean, . But make your quad strong. Both sides. Amazing how it atrophies though, huh? You'll get it back. So you're gonna have pain after the surgery.

We had a lot of rules in our house, and they were all good rules, and it was, you know, strict, it was fun, it was a little bit of both. The best way I can explain it is... ...so you know when you're at football practice, and the coach is putting in a new play for the week, and you run it 40 times, and 39 of those times you get told everything you did wrong? That was growing up here. We opened a business, and we bought our first home, and we put our kids through good schools, and we spent a lot of time with our children. I mean it was like, I mean, we were a regular family. My -- My parents were very tough. My -- They were strict. My mom's like a real stern little German lady.

Me, not having a dad and -- and having a working mom, it was real important to me to make sure I spent as much time with my kids and gave them the best opportunity that they could to succeed in this world. I'd go to work in the morning, come home at 5:30 or 6, pick Julian up, and we'd go find either a baseball field, a basketball court, or a football field, and we'd go practice.

It's still... Like I said, we developed a friendship, but also, you know, a -- an on-field chemistry, too. Tom Brady was gonna get a -- He was going to have a relationship with Julian whether -- whether -- whether he liked it or not. When I think about Brady and Edelman, I mean you think about a -- a Rice Montana, you-- you're thinking about Irv and Aikman because they've won, man, at the highest level. He pushes Tom, Tom pushes him. Brady looks at Julian as an ultimate ally. It's kind of like that suitcase in Pulp Fiction , you know, when the guy opens that thing up and you don't know what it is. That's what it is. The reason why they're successful together is, after practice, you got Tom Brady and Julian Edelman in the bubble, running routes. Pass after pass after pass. Up and down the field. That's why it starts to translate on the field as successfully as it has over the years. He's the kind of guy you just want to be in the -- in the dog fight with. And uh, you know, the -- the hairier it gets the better it gets with him. Tom ... looks left. Throws for Edelman! Touchdown Patriots! We ended up going out and winning a Super Bowl. -We did it! -I love you, man. We did it, bro. I love you. You worked your ass off. You're the greatest quarterback in the world man! Hey, I love you man. And then, you know, messed around and did it again. Ah, that's a catch! -Oh my god! -That's incredible! We made a story! What did I say at halftime? It's gonna be a hell of a story. -I know. -I love you, bro. -Unbelievable. -Five.

Dear Mr. Edelman, Pursuant to article 39, section 7 of the collective bargaining agreement, this will set forth the NFL's disciplinary decision in connection to a positive test for performance enhancing substances. Mm. It's been determined that you will be suspended for four games. During the suspension period, the player will not be paid, nor may he participate in team activities. He may not use the club's facilities, nor have contact with any team personnel. Damn cuh, you fucked up. I'm not alone in this world of how I think. You know, work hard, sacrific Try to do the right thing If you make a mistake, fix it and move on. It's one of those things where you just gotta man up and... ...tell him, and know he's gonna probably be disappointed. I get to work one morning and he had called his father. Then his father told me. And I was jus-- I was just in shock. Couldn't believe it. He said, "Dad, I -- I -- I... ...I'm going to be suspended for four games," and he told me the reason why. Obviously, you know -- there's a sense of "What the hell is going on? What the fuck?" Frank was very upset. We had a different stance on a couple of things. Jules didn't want his dad a part of this process. He was handling it with his attorneys. My husband doesn't understand that sometimes. I think, uh, we both needed a little time away. He needed it more than I. Me and my dad talk everyday. And uh, after that, we didn't talk for a while ♪acoustic guitar strumming♪ You know, through the whole suspension time, you obviously have some feelings of isolation. ♪I'm waiting♪ Just because you're not in the building, you're not communicating with your teammates, you're watching them on TV.

Tighten it up, the last couple days before the start, so... -It's good to have you in town. -Thank you. Yeah, I know he's pumped as well. Yeah, I can't wait to watch him. What's the word of this year, Jules? -Patience. -Patience. We gotta let this game come to us. -You're not Johnny Unitas, bud. -Johnny U, baby! Johnny U. Three yards and a cloud of dust. There was no football to be played those four weeks, obviously. So, Frank got to coach him again. Frank was happy. He got to coach his boy again. Get him ready. I think they both were very happy. It was something they hadn't done in a very long time. Some things never change. I just want you to protect yourself. Put that fucking ball away. And take that hit. I try to interfere with those basics, just throw the towel at him. Cover his eyes. Walk in front of him before the ball gets to him so he loses sight of the ball for a moment.

Well, job well done buddy. You made it. He'd be anywhere he wants to be. Jules can pretty much do anything he wants to do when he puts his mind to it. Last thing he needs is me. Nah. Not true.

You know? People have doubted him his whole life, you know? I'm not gonna do it. Yeah, I would never bet against a guy like Jules. Again, I think he's actually better when people bet against him, because he plays tougher, more laser-focused. He's gonna come back with some fight, for sure. Don't ever doubt Julian. If you -- if you say he's not going to, he'll do it. Just to show you he will do it. Yeah, we're paying you a bunch of money. How much longer do we have to wait? We're losing games!

This was originally gonna be the ending of the film, but then these goddamn Patriots had to do what they always do. My life sucks. This is fucked up. My life really sucks. I am narrating a documentary about a New England Patriot, despite the fact that it's Julian Edelman. Everybody loves Julian Edelman. He'll s -- He's still a Patriot! Whatever. Just go ahead, roll it. Go. Action! Let's review. The Patriots start two and two. Dynasty is over, Tom's done, pack it up. Jules comes back from suspension, week five against the Colts. They win that game, go on a little run. Win against the Chiefs, Packers, Bills, and Bears. Seven and two. Not bad. Keep an eye on those Chiefs. Jules is doing alright. Maybe a little rusty, but the offense seems to be doing okay. And here come the Titans! Brady is obliterated! Knocked on his ass! Oh my god, that looked like it hurt. Patriots bounce back, a couple more wins. Jules is doing okay, I guess. Everything is back to normal. And from the top ropes, the Dolphins! The Miami Dolphins! There is a miracle in Miami! Nine and four! Suck on that, Patriots! Bam, Steelers, nine and five. Losing two in a row? Two in a row? The Patriots lost two in a row? They finish with the Bills and the Jets, 11 and five. Two seed, locked in. Playoffs, baby. We're talkin' playoffs. Let's gooo! Rivers looks good, Chargers are stack Enh! Welcome to Foxborough. Like Lionel Richie, bro. All night long. Alright, here we go. This is the one. AFC Championship game in Kansas City. Arrowhead is terrifying. Chiefs look unstoppable. Mahomes is the future. There's a super wolf blood moon. What the fuck -- what the fuck is a wolf blood moon? Close game, Jules tries his best to blow it. Come on! He definitely touched it, he touched the ball! Look at his pinky! ...passes, tapped and intercepted! He responds in a big way. Third and Edelman. Overtime. Hey, let's go to the Super Bowl now. Hey, this will go to the Super Bowl! Then, Tom Brady does what Tom Brady does: -Super Bowl. -Touchdown Patriots! And they're bound for Super Bowl LIII. We're going back, baby! America's worst nightmare is back!
