(Automatic cleaned English translation with DeepL from official man-made French) In the sky, there were three white lines, vertical, and one that stayed away. I don't know what I saw. A point in the sky, a line of light. A dark object hovering above a bridge from which we were coming back, it almost looked like a... A strange, amorphous, opalescent thing. An unidentified object. It was coming very fast. It stayed perfectly still and stationary in the sky for about 45 minutes, then it started to move. And it was really weird, really strange, and I still don't know what it was. He made a sharp right turn, and it went up 90 degrees. They calculated that he was going 1300 km/h. Then they changed formation. At first it was vertical. Then it went sideways. And then they switched to a rectangular shape. But this one stayed away from the others. I started very young, I witnessed abnormal events... CAROLINE CORY UFO RESEARCHER AND FILMMAKER ...and this is what led me to become to get interested in ufology. I became a researcher and a lecturer. Over the years, I have met people from all walks of life, from all over the world, who have had similar experiences with UFOs. So this phenomenon is not new. It's very old and very widespread. However, this whole subject lacks credibility and acceptance in the society, but also among the elites. And it was only in 2017, when the New York Times came out with an article with three leaked videos... UFOS, FROM A PRANK TO NATIONAL SECURITY ...of the US Navy that defy explanation, that the debate has evolved. I got it! Against the wind, which is 220 km/h to the west. Look at that! He's pivoting. There's a whole fleet of them. Look on the ASA. My goodness. On the USS Princeton... NIMITZ MEETING CLASSIFIED RECORDS ...I was responsible of the classified documents, secret records. In November 2004, we were doing exercises to prepare for our next deployment. I was on the USS Princeton, lead operations specialist, and we were checking the radars. We're leading the battle, if there is a battle. My main task was to identify everything that was flying in the sky. On November 10, I started to notice strange contacts off Catalina. During these exercises, we followed unknown planes over several days. For the context, we are at 8,500 m, we are going south at 185 km/h, and I say to myself that I have never seen anything fly in this way. I spent 15 and a half years at sea behind that radar. At one point, it was raining UFOs. I had never seen anything fight like that, and all the other ships were spotting it too. Fast Eagle was in flight. Commander Fravor, the first to take off from this carrier. These objects have fallen. They went up to 8,500 m in less than a second. And at the very end, there was one... Right in front of him. He has disappeared. They have shown flying abilities far beyond than anything I had ever seen. USS PRINCETON MEETS NIMITZ, 2004 I know well anything that flies fast, and next to it, it looked like toys. Since these videos were filmed by the military, the Navy and the Pentagon have finally confirmed confirmed the veracity of these observations. Senator Reid, Senator Rubio and others have urged Congress to investigate to investigate these events and to issue an official report on its findings. Although several credible cases have been have been investigated, UAP report, unidentified aerial phenomena, proved to be inconclusive, which unfortunately did not surprise a large part of the community. When you don't know what it is, nothing can be definitively ruled out. Can they find an explanation? This is a very small part of the evidence the government has on UFOs. What does the American government know about UFOs? If this bomb had not come out in the New York Times, Politico and CNN... INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST ...we wouldn't be here today. The Pentagon hasn't been opened at all. They were awful with this file. Awful. What we need, is real evidence, real data, no matter how long it takes, that's what gives you complete proof. The next morning, I say to myself, "Okay, "I'm going to write a report very detailed report on what happened." I went back up to the Combat Information Center Center, the CIC, and one of the chief technicians looked at me and said, "Chief, the data is no longer on the ship." I said, "What do you mean?" "Someone came on board and took our data. "They made us erase everything in the computer room, "even the blank tapes were erased." All our recording equipment was confiscated. And on top of that, we had to erase everything that was left stored. That was very unusual. I raised my hand and said: "We've got a safety issue here." I tried to describe the events, I got laughed at. I was laughed at, they were posting jokes, comics about me... I was very frustrated. It ended my career. Some of my shipmates lost their careers, their wives, the possibility of seeing their children. These are the consequences of these events that have occurred, that we are told not to talk about. It was scary, and I was lonely. At one point... I didn't know what I was going to do. I went through... a lot of pain. It is unimaginable to think that an encounter with UFOs could affect these men to the point where they lose their their careers, their personal and social lives. Now I'm even more determined to help them find answers. After all these years, I think that if the government is not officially able to to provide real answers to these very frequent cases, it is perhaps up to us to look into it, from a new scientific point of view, because it's never been done. I decided to take on this challenge. I will assemble a team of scientists and experts and see if we can capture these objects ourselves and come up with answers. But first, I want to invite someone I really like... William Shatner. I've met him on several projects. Because he is the icon of the science fiction world, and that he is involved in the world of ufology and the mysteries of the world for a long time. His insights will be valuable to help us bridge the gap between science between science fiction and real science, and this will give us an additional perspective on this phenomenon UFOs and UAPs. On the origin of humanity, there is an insatiable curiosity. Insatiable. What's that? No one knows. The phenomenon. Here we are talking about UFOs. The fact that the government is broadcasting all these videos that they say are real... - They say it's real? - Yes. That it's really an unidentified flying object? Have you seen the UAP report? - Not conclusive. - Exactly. AVAILABLE REPORTS INCONCLUSIVE So we are very frustrated. But what are you looking for? Data. I think there were a lot of very credible cases. Pilots from the Air Force, Navy, Army. There are so many credible cases that you would think to be able to investigate and publish data. No, they do surveys. You would expect them to give a few things. - Or else... - Yes. - That's it. - So... I had an idea... A good one, I'm sure. I told myself I had to go all the way and do it in a big way. We need to do a scientific investigation. That's great. Navy pilots were off Catalina, that's when they saw what's on on the Tic Tacs videos, and other ships have seen it, all in the same area. So I thought... We put together a team of scientists, experts, military, since they have the experience, to try to capture something in real time. Yes, if you could get closer, electronically and visually, to an unidentified flying object, you would be in all the papers. On the Tic Tacs video, for example, there are no other angles of the same object. We have no measurement of the radiations. - No... - No triangulation. We have no triangulation. But the radar picked it up, as well as the cameras on the boats, - if I'm not mistaken. - Yes. All it takes, is a phenomenon. Apparently you think that this is a good idea. - A wonderful idea. - Great. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to it. to hear and, hopefully, see what you have discovered, to see what you've discovered. Great, thank you. What we need, is the indisputable proof that will settle the debate once and for all. the debate once and for all. BESTSELLER AUTHOR AND THEORETICAL PHYSICIST No ifs, ands or buts. And so, we will rewrite the whole of human history. I was delighted to learn that the Navy personnel on the USS Nimitz had created the UAPx team team with renowned scientists and experts to study the UFO phenomenon phenomenon in more depth, with rigorous scientific methodologies. scientific methodologies. The UAPx team was therefore ideal for this for this first expedition. UAPX KICK-OFF MEETING - There they are. - Hi, Gary. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Kevin, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Great. This is Jeremy. Nice to meet you. - Hello, Jeremy. - Hello, Mr. OSIRIS. Absolutely. These are the people from the USS Princeton that everyone is talking about. Who better than the people who have experienced the phenomenon? - You're the one who started it all. - Yes. I'm very happy, because if we want to bring credibility to this phenomenon, you have to go all the way. It has to count. It has to be scientific. We have precisely created our company because we didn't have these answers. - We agree. - It was great to talk and everybody knew that it was real, but we need to do more. Video is one thing, but we need more data. Personally, I think you have to go back to where you were... Southern California. What do you suggest? What should we do? We have a few locations that would make a good cover of the southern part of the island. Ideally, Caroline... If we could have a house on the beach, that would be ideal. And maybe a place with a flat roof on Catalina. And a third place, for the truck. So, if we have two fixed positions, and Jeremy in one place, we could do some kind of triangulation, - which is very important... - That would be optimal. ...to collect data. So who do we have on the team? Myself, Gary Voorhis, Kevin Day. We have Jason Turner. And we were all together on the Princeton. We also have Dave Altman and Michael Hall, two experienced ufologists. Then our scientist, Kevin Knuth, who is a university professor of physics in physics and an expert on exoplanets. And Matthew Szydagis, university professor of physics. Expert in dark matter and radiation detection. Next we have David Mason. He invented several devices capable of detecting communications from the UAP. We have optics, acoustics. What else? Thermal. Anything we can use. With all this equipment and all of us over five days, 24 hours a day, if we don't see anything, I'll be very disappointed. It would be disappointing if we didn't see anything. But that's science. Has this ever been done before? - Never. - Not that I know of. Even from the government. We're making history. As the main team settles in at the Laguna site, Gary, Kevin and I decided to charter a plane to find Catalina Island the best place for our potential observations. After all the events, Kevin Day said: "Let's go away and study what it was." I want this to be the best view of the sea. - In front of the sea. - Exactly. My goal will be to prove that these things exist, are findable and knowable. We can find out what it is. That's my goal. I think we're going to have some really good places. Let's see if we can find them. Let's look for the missing the missing data ourselves. I want to be the one who makes the identification, that was my job in the Navy. The best viewpoint we found on Catalina Island is on the roof of a building, facing the sea. We have Dave, Michael, and a friend of ours, Chrissy Newton, at this location. They will be in constant communication with us on the mainland and will be able to alert us as soon as they have an observation. We will be on the roof of a building. Excellent line of sight. All the equipment is already there. We'll have thermal binoculars, normal binoculars... Everything you see, you can document it and cross-check it with the data we'll have on the other side. I have a feeling we'll find something. There are observations here since the early 40's. You know what to do, let's just go ahead and set it up. - Great. - We'll do quarters. - Yes. - Okay. - Great. - Come on. Michael and Dave leave for Catalina. We are looking forward to it, but a little nervous because the logistics for the installation in Catalina and communication are quite difficult. There are no trucks or or vehicles on the island to help us move the equipment. And even if we have a communication protocol, we will have to rely on on an unreliable mobile network. But as a team, we keep a positive attitude hoping for the best. Here we go, Mike. Let's set up our big eyes, and then we'll do an inventory of what we have. We're going to familiarize ourselves with all of this, we'll see if we can keep up a UAP going thousands of miles per hour. - It will take... - Whiplash. It's going to be hard to catch them, but we'll see. LAGUNA BEACH TEAM HEADQUARTERS When I hear that you have assembled a team of great scientists with state-of-the-art equipment to answer these questions, I say to myself: "What took so long?" The data is out there... LOCATION OF THE OSIRIS SATELLITE ...so we have to jump on these objects, wherever they go. Wherever the data takes us, that's where we have to go. So I say it's about time. Here we are, the first day is dedicated to to the installation of the equipment. We've already had power outages and software malfunctions. We only have five days to complete our mission. So the stakes are high. We came prepared, but the chances of spotting real anomalous objects during these five days are 50-50. We don't know what to expect. There's a friend of mine, Chrissy Newton. Another pair of eyes, so three instead of two. I've got something. - I've got something, Michael. - You do? Yes, over here. Come here, quickly. Up there. It's moving, damn it. Hurry up. Is it a good one? Do you see a white ball above the mountain? Yes. Do you see it, Mike? Not yet. I see it moving. - Is it moving? - Yes, she is. We've seen several things. The first thing we saw was a UFO... UFO RESEARCHER ...or so we think. We saw a device moving in the sky. Good job. UAPX INVESTIGATOR The extra pair of eyes was helpful. We saw strange lights in the sky, when we arrived, and others about an hour later, and it got a little cloudy. We decided to leave it there and come back the next day. When a member of the team spots an anomalous object, the protocol is to contact immediately contact the rest of the team to see if they spot the same object from different angles. And they also have to record what they're seeing and send the recording to our scientists. The mobile communication failed that day, but the recordings were sent to the scientists for analysis. This is our first sighting. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. But it's the first day, I guess that's a good sign. LAGUNA BEACH DAY 2 - Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning, gentlemen. We got it all out. We've got half the equipment installed. Is the radiation detector working? Yes, I ran it. And the UFO DAP? There is a software update. I'll install it today. Got it. What about the sky watch? Everything is in place. - It's all set. - Very good. Is everything going well? Jason, anything to report? No, I think we're good. All right, let's give it all away. Let's get everything set up by noon. We need to record as much data as possible. This is our chance. Let's go. - Great, let's go. - All right, let's go. Half of our equipment is experimental. The other half is... One part is old, one part is not, and some of it is high-tech. We just hope it works. Where do we put this? I think the main place will be here, in the corner, where I'm standing. We have a perfect view of Catalina from here. We have an open airspace above us. Good, this is the little brother of what I have in the OSIRIS. UFO DAP SYSTEM We have the magnetometers. The GPS. Wireless connectivity. Barometric pressure, weather indicators, ADS-B... We can follow known aircraft with this. And the best part is this. I can control that from OSIRIS. So if this thing is transmitting signals, we'll get it. A friend of mine, Travis Taylor, who is an astrophysicist, is involved in the study of anomalous events and UAPs from a scientific point of view for a long time. So I wanted to invite him to see our equipment to give his opinion on our technology. I'm optimistic. That's great for the first day. We're going to have to watch this frame by frame. - Look who's here. - Hi! Hi, Travis. Travis, it's been a long time. Two years ago at the conference. You guys know each other? - Yes. - Right. David Mason. He is the brain behind all the inventions but there are two big brains here too. Wait until you see what's up there. This is crazy. Are you presenting everything to him? - I'll do that. - With pleasure. Very good. Very good. I'm really looking forward to see the instruments, the preparation of their experiment. It will change the culture of the whole world. Scientists are going to have to start to take this more seriously if we want to understand this phenomenon. I hear chirping and clicking. The chirps are gamma radiation, higher energy particles. And the click is beta radiation, - of the lower energy. - Yes. What part of the spectrum can you see? From about 10 megahertz to about 2 gigahertz. We can see all radios, the televisions, everything that people use. If there's something that shouldn't be there, - then you will see it. - Absolutely. What else do you have here? Eight FLIR thermal imaging cameras. You can see pretty much the whole sky - in FLIR, if you want. - Absolutely. Normally, the UAP researchers have a FLIR that looks like this or this. Now you can see everywhere. Many unknown objects that I've recorded had temperatures of -30 degrees. I've even had it down to -60, which is extraordinarily cold. Without any escapement, and no explanation. What is this? A light wave transmitter. Is it connected to a laser or something? Yes, it's connected to a white wave transmitter. Which is strange, is that they have a beat, and my theory is that it's information or data. If a PUG, in the distance, modulates its brightness to give us information, and that we convert it into sound, our brain and our ears, and various computer algorithms, could read something into it. That's it. We can also take this sound that we get and put it back on the transmitter... - And send it back to them. - Directly. If they send data that we don't understand, we can say, "Here." This is the first protocol in any communication than to say, "Hello, world." If we hear "Hello, world." we answer the same thing. What is great, is that you have the ability to detect communications and rebroadcast them in electromagnetics, in radio, in microwave, in optical, ultraviolet, visible and infrared, as well as in temperature... it gives a wide range of potential communications. We don't know how they could communicate. That's right. That's impressive. I can't wait to see it work, I hope we see UAP and talk to him. - I'd like that. - I'd like that too. We use high-tech equipment to collect techno-signatures. We hope to be able to to use this technology, if we find them, to shake their hand, or maybe even talk to them. I have to say, after seeing all your equipment, I'm impressed. You cover the phenomenology of the whole spectrum of physics. I've never seen anything so concentrated on one particular type of phenomena. Here's something else. This is not my idea, it's designed by my friends and colleagues at MIT. This is a radiation detector to look for anything abnormal, higher than a normal prime rate. LAGUNA BEACH DAY 3 DAY 3 - NIGHT THE FIRST DISCOVERY - One more. - Great. Look, Mike. That's... Oh, my God. Okay, look at... Right there. I'm not leaving him anymore. - Can you see it? - It's huge. Yes, it's not a plane. - It is... - No. He came out of nowhere. Okay, let's see if we can record this. Yes. - I got it. - Yes, you have it. I want to see it until it's gone. - I want to see how it moves. - How it goes. Yes, that's what I want. It's not a star, it wasn't there before. And that would be a really bright star. There's no way that's a star. - And it's pretty low on the horizon. - Yes. Hi, Michael. We just saw something pretty abnormal. Dave and I both have it night vision footage of it... different angles, same object. I need the bearing angle. Which way does it go? 300 degrees northwest, that's when it appeared in front of us... Up to about 29 degrees northeast, and it disappeared in the clouds towards the mainland, where you are. Very good, Michael, I'm looking at ADS-B and MLAT. We don't have any aircraft in the vicinity of the island. We have a few towards the coast, and one towards the south towards the island. But there is nothing that goes or was going in the direction of which we speak. Okay, Jason, look at 30 degrees towards the island. Give me a description, what did it look like? It was a plain white spherical object. Put your hands in front of these two cameras. Good. We'll mark it on these two cameras two, three minutes ago, to find it on the recording. We filmed an object with two different cameras. I'm on my way. Okay, this is it. We just had a triple repeat of gamma frequencies. - Is that right? - Yes. Where is Matt? I'm going to look with the night vision because we have to watch the sky. Yes, we have to watch. Keep an eye out. We have a lot of triple peaks on our gamma. I see a strong flashing light... Jeremy, we need a third point of view. - We're going to go. - Okay. They are next to Avalon, just to the left of Avalon. There was a flash of light... - Several flashes of light. - A 737 Max is coming towards us. No, I saw the plane, at about 45 degrees altitude. But it was at Avalon level. - Oh, it's on the horizon. - On the horizon. Very bright. We have one coming right at them. Yeah, he says it's on the horizon. It would be on our horizon... - You said in Avalon? - ...here. Yes. It was just to the left of Avalon. There were three very bright flashes. - Several times. - Jeremy, let's go. - Matthew. - What's going on? We're getting spikes. That's an increase in radiation. And it's gaining intensity, and sometimes it stabilizes. In the last five, ten minutes, we've had three spikes. To pick that up from miles away, it must be an incredibly incredibly powerful source. Like a light bulb, everything unfolds in three dimensions. To get a reading from a very distant object, it has to be an intense source of what is being produced. It's more interesting if we can correlate that to a peak, at the same time as the visual observations. I am impatient. Me too, but we have to be sure that it's not a satellite or a plane, but that's what's great in our configuration and that makes it unique, because to my knowledge, there is no of radioactive birds or planes, so that helps to exclude banal explanations like that. Dude, there's no one... You see where this is going. Okay. No one will come. The tower is in place. It's on its way. Good, we're ready and running. They are operational. They are five miles away... Can you see the laser? But around... Nothing goes this way. It's coming this way. We have triple peaks. Here's another one. - Another triple. - Great. We have a lot of triples, keep your eyes open. We've seen some anomalous objects that are not satellites, nor anomalies. The fact that these things were of a solid color, round and ovoid, were moving in an irregular way, without sound... It was amazing. You see it. It didn't activate the camera... It was just very bright. Yes, it was brilliant. It went right through the screen here. Yeah, like that. Did you see it on the... No, it didn't show up, that's what's weird. It never showed up on the Fisheye. So the Fisheye never triggered the PTZ. I only saw it on the PTZ camera. I'm coming to the news, see what you have. We've got some weird stuff here. What do you have? We saw an object only on the PTZ camera. It did not appear on the Fisheye. And I've never seen a case where I have two cameras within 50 cm of each other, and one sees the object and the other one doesn't. So it's literally abnormal that a camera sees a cloud and the object and the other one, only the cloud. But I don't see the object where it should be. It's just not there. This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen. CATALINA 21H53 It's gone! - It's gone. - Damn it. - It's gone. - It's just gone. Yes, gone. - Holy crap. - Did you film the disappearance? Yes. - David. - Yes? I was looking at the recordings from the sky watch... LAGUNA BEACH 23H30 ...and I found some events high frequency events and a high energy event, between 18:07 and 18:13. Do you have anything at the FLIR at that time? Yes, we have an anomalous object. I don't know what to call it, because it's not a plane, or a bird, or an insect. It does not correspond to any known prosaic object. And it moves opposite to its trajectory, as if it was moving sideways against the wind, if it is an airborne object. It looks like the Tic Tac of the Nimitz. Yes, it does. I got it! Against the wind, which is 220 km/h to the west. And there was an event at 32 MeV, within the uncertainty range in the time synchronization. Matthew, I have something else. An object that suddenly appears suddenly appearing on the screen. What was that? There's... The object appears and then leaves the screen quite suddenly. And then it seems to reappear. Is it the same object that comes back? That's possible. It looks like it's in the same place. See how it zigzags? He's coming and going. - This is exciting. - It's abnormal, right? We won't be able to explain it easily. Not very easily. No prosaic explanations like bird interference there. Look at this. We have an object that will appear in the frame... - What is it? - Did you see that? - Yes. - Which is strange, is that the thermal camera sees cold on several pixels. And there's movement. It looks like it's turning or tilting, and appears and then dissipates. Even weirder than what you showed me. - Yes. - What time was that? At 21:29. This corresponds to the night vision videos from the island team. Yeah, that's where they sent their night vision videos. They saw an anomalous object and we saw, too, an anomalous object on the FLIR. - That would be a remarkable coincidence. - Yes. How could he appear and then disappear without leaving the frame or leaving a trail? It was there, then it wasn't there. - He disappears. - He disappeared. - He is gone. - He has disappeared. Another interesting fact is that this camera here was at a 45 degree angle towards Catalina Island. It would be conceivable that this is... - The same object, yes. - The same object. Because they triangulate from their point of view, then we triangulate and it converges into two points. This would mean that we saw the same object not just from different angles, but also three different wavelengths visible light and two different types of infrared, right? So this is unprecedented in the history of UAP research. Corresponding data under different wavelengths, including radiation, it's just phenomenal. In science, it's very important, especially when you study an unknown phenomenon, to have several different modes, different perspectives of observations, so as to obtain correlations between different devices studying the same phenomenon. This reduces the probability of hardware malfunction, bugs and such, there is less chance that something is accidental. If it shows up on different devices, especially since they are based on different different technologies, you can look at the same thing in different ways. Today, July 14, 2021, is an eventful day. At 17:26, a pink object appears, turns around and leaves the frame. This is very abnormal. At 18:07, a high energy radiation is measured at 32.32 MeV. At 18:09, we capture another object object moving sideways. Could it be the same Tic Tacs observed in 2004 by the Navy on the USS Nimitz, then by other ships between 2014 and 2019? That would be amazing. Later in the evening, at 9:29 p.m, Catalina's team captures an anomalous object, solid in color, on two night vision cameras and a CCD camera, which corresponds to a solid object on our FLIR camera. This object is cold, which means that it does not have a propulsion system propulsion system that we know. The object disappears suddenly, simultaneously from several angles. What is even more intriguing, is that at the same time, the OSIRIS registers an abnormal object on one camera, but not on the other. These are very intriguing events and very compelling, and amazing correlations. Today was a breakthrough in our expedition and research. I am confident that we are finally on the right track to find out what these Tic Tac objects these Tic Tac objects, or at least to get more convincing data about data on UAPs and UFOs. Only one credible and irrefutable proof is needed and irrefutable to change the whole history of the world. All human literature would be changed by a single irrefutable event. Science is also about the analysis of data. It's not just the hardware, it's the software. Not just computer software, I'm talking about our human minds and our intelligence, and apply it to data analysis. So this is the first one, and it was a pretty clear night. You have to be careful, a lot of spots are obviously stars. We also see fast objects passing by, probably shooting stars. - But this? - No, that's... What is this slow object? And it's changing speed, it has slowed down and bent its course. He changes his angle and doesn't blink. It doesn't blink like an airplane would an airplane with its lights. Part of the scientific analysis is to exclude objects that could easily be mistaken be mistaken for UFOs, like a high-tech human object or a mirage-like object or an orb that can easily imitate a UFO a UFO because of its reflectivity, or any atmospheric event. There is a phenomenon that you didn't mention. Yes. We know that whales sing songs. And that they can hear them on the other side of the ocean, 1,500 km away. The sound bounces off layers of water of different temperatures then can be heard miles away. The same phenomenon applies to light. Do you know this? Fata Morgana is a mirage. People, and I've seen this myself, see something on a rock or at some distance in the desert, sometimes a strange thing, that disappears when you get closer. Something's going on over there. The light bounces off a layer of warm air of warm air over there and appears here. Those floating boats we saw, mirages and many other objects, the explanation is that many phenomena are natural and explainable. But it is also possible that some are not explained, and that's what you're working on. - That's the idea of this research... - Yes. Explaining the explainable, what people would think would think is an anomaly, - but it's not. - Yes. Yes, exactly. When a normal person looks up at the night sky, or even during the day, and sees something strange, in her head, she switches to UAP. I can assure you that we have technologies that do crazy things that look so unconventional that the vast majority of the citizens of this country have no idea what is actually flying actually flies in our skies. For example, the Northrop Grumman X-47B. It can go over Mach 9. It has the shape of an equilateral triangle. It can climb to 12 000 or 15,000 meters. At this altitude, you can't hear any sound. So the only thing we see, is the reflection of the ambient light on the surface of the plane, which gives the impression that a luminous triangle is flying in the sky. Another example of a drone that few people know about, is the Northrop Grumman Bat. It is much smaller. It would fit in the trunk of my car. These devices can be launched from a catapult on a ship, without the need of a runway or a cockpit. They are propeller-driven, electric, and have up to 18 hours of autonomy. This is a drone that has a small battery, but with very complete sensors and almost 20 hours of flight, which allows him to go to sea, to turn around a ship and return. What the Tic Tac was doing, from my understanding of this field, we don't know how to do it. LAGUNA BEACH DAY 4 - Thanks for coming, Ryan. - No problem. Let's sit down, I'll cook you up a little bit. That's fine with me. - It's been a long time. - It has. Thank you for coming, shipmate. Thank you for visiting us during our research. You were on board when Commander Fravor made his interception - and the Tic Tac video was captured. - Yes. Can you describe to me exactly how you learned about it, what you were doing on board? I've never met you before and it's a pretty small ship. I was in the air detachment. I was the first chief petty officer of the HSL-43 detachment. aboard the Princeton. I had been fighting with the shore command because we needed equipment. We were looking at the logistics for that. It was during this time that the interception took place. There were radar screens, so I was able to see it. And, of course, all the commotion and what was going on around me - during that time... - Yes. ...have been accentuated. Were you there when the civilians came on board? I call them now the men in khaki, because... Yes, I was there when they arrived. I was in the hangar during the operations. They came in, came right out of the hangar, and then they took off shortly thereafter with bags. I can tell you what they took. Yes, I know. All our data records. Did you see the Tic Tacs video and the "GIMBAL" videos, and with all that we know about what really happened, the flight characteristics and the capabilities of the craft, you know the planes well because you work on the bridge... What did you think? What I thought of it is that there were absolutely no planes can do what they were doing, to my knowledge. I know that nobody wants to be the one to talk about UFOs, and it's hard to talk about it, anyway. What motivated you to talk about it? It was stigmatized, on the bridge, to talk about it? There is always a stigma when you talk about UFOs. It doesn't matter if people believe us or not believe us or not, there will be consequences. I was planning to make a a second career in the Defense as a contract worker, but I was ridiculed... CERTIFICATE OF DISMISSAL ...and I had lost my reputation... It almost destroyed me. I saw this video on TV, and I thought, "Holy shit, this is it." I dropped my plate, I went on the Internet and I found out what had just happened. It shook me to my core, I knew that my life was going to change again. I had been through so much suffering, and suddenly I felt understood. I saw what I saw, and I can't ignore what I saw. And if I saw it and it happened, I want to be able to prove it. I was lucky that I didn't keep a trauma at the same level as others. But instead of trying to make it public, I internalized it. Long after the event, I was empty inside. I really didn't care to live or die. Or if someone wanted to have a relationship with me, I was not capable of an interpersonal relationship. You have to tell the truth about what we saw. That's what bothers us, not being able to tell the absolute truth the whole truth about things. Because no one would believe us, because the government didn't tell the truth either. Of course. Do you want to see what we have upstairs? - I'd love to. - Let's go. Every step we take to find out what these Tic Tacs are is a step towards the recovery of these men. The acceptance of the event that changed their lives. I feel like with this assignment, we are discovering more and more pieces of the puzzle that will hopefully hopefully one day provide some answers to these very strange events. We are on the fourth day of the of the expedition. I am very happy with the results that we have so far. Hopefully we will have more tomorrow. Mason's inventions, converting light into sound and sound into light worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They capture light from objects in the sky and retransmit the same signal in the space non-stop. I decided to try and see if we could capture the sound of an abnormal object and broadcast our own music and sound to them in space. SOUND OF ALTAIR - It's over there. - Which star? That's Altair. If you aim at it - and stay centered on it... - Yes. You can hear it. - Yes. - You can hear its rumble. There's a plane. I hear the plane. It's different. Do you see, over there? - There's a different sound. - It could be a satellite. That's great. Is that the middle one? Is that the visible light? Yes. We have two different types of music that are transmitted on two different spectra. It's like radio stations that have different frequencies. It allows you to separate them and have different data. I'm blown away by David Mason's inventions. If we can capture the sound of objects in the sky, then we can potentially identify the acoustic pattern of a UFO, which can give us more information about the properties of these objects. And the music we play can reach all points of space and, potentially, a UFO would receive our music as a means of communication and hopefully try to communicate with us here on Earth. The only way to know if this mode of communication works is to run the devices continuously the devices continuously and see if there is a correlation with an actual UFO sighting in a measurable way. That would be phenomenal. Fourth day, I'm very tired, I haven't slept at all. Apart from that, we still have abnormal data with the radiation detectors and the FLIRs are working continuously. Until tomorrow, I'm going to go get some sleep for a few hours. DAY 5 THE LAST DAY I hope Gary will arrive soon. I can sleep a little bit. - He is already here. - Too late. - Good morning. - Good morning. - That was awkward. - Yes, it was. You still have to work. It's finally starting to look good. This is great. Except for the neighbors. They think that our equipment sees through walls. Yes. When the police arrived last night, they were worried, but we showed them what we were doing, and they were intrigued. It must have been interesting, because they sent the other two here. - They had a good time. - They did. - Come on, let's go. - Let's get to work. Why is it always radiation, never coffee? Well... We have an abnormal event to check on. Did it show up on the FLIR? No, but I think you can help us. Look, he's going down down the coast, turns and goes up. The black spot is us. What's the orange line? This is the flight path, which descends and deviates to pass just above us. Is that a helicopter? - Yes, it's not a UAP. - It's a chopper. - Wait a minute. - That's a chopper. - But that's... - This is a joke, man. Couldn't this be industrial espionage? - I called the company. - We're not an industry yet. This is the video where it goes over us. This is crazy. Yes. Come on, let's get to work. All right, let's get to work. - Okay, Gary... - Yes. A Navy guy walks into a bar. A three-foot salami under one arm and a poodle under the other... Sounds like fun. It's been hard because it's a lot of work, a lot of data and equipment. But I'm very happy, because David Mason tells me that he recorded a burst of objects falling from the sky. Kevin Day said that at one point, it was raining Tic Tacs. I don't know if these are the same Tic Tacs that are raining that Kevin Day was talking about, but it's fascinating and I can't wait to find out. What do you have? We have something very interesting, Gary. Look at the screen. We have objects that seem to be falling from the sky - and you see that? - Yes, I saw it. It's there momentarily, and it looks like it's falling into the ocean. It's crazy. Could this be a camera be a camera artifact? But there's a transition time, so it's very strange. It could be ice that forms and falls into the water? No, because we also see its transition, where he appears momentarily in the field of vision and then disappears. But it clearly has a downward trajectory. It appears, disappears, reappears, - when it touches the water. - It looks like it's touching the water. It looks like it's lighting up in the water. It's amazing. - Does this remind you of anything? - Of course it does. It reminds me of the Tic Tacs of 2004. They were coming down from 8,500 m to the sea like that. In free fall. I saw the first group of these things November 10, and the interception with Fast Eagle took place on the 14th. And I continued to see them until about November 19. They were always in groups of five to ten. But if you added up all the groups, there were about 100. There were dozens of streaks like this, which correspond not only to the high energies but also to the high rates of cosmic rays. After reviewing the videos that we have filmed, we were able to calculate the size of the objects from the field of view of the camera and the distance from the horizon. They were at least 4 feet tall and were falling at least 8,000 km/h. And the distant objects would be 20 m wide and would fall at least 135 000 km/h. So even assuming margins of error of 50%, we have extraordinary numbers that can't explain this phenomenon as being something natural or known. Guys, what are you doing? They show me objects falling from the sky into the ocean. They found data correlated with the detected radiation. Honestly, it reminds me what we were seeing in 2004. Tic Tacs? Navy Tic Tacs? - Maybe. - On our cameras? - Yes. - That's amazing. With this gradual disappearance, - it looks like it's falling from the sky. - Yes. The way it disappears. That's great. We have a lot of of things, actually. Honestly, I was really surprised at how much we have. David, yesterday we were doing all the night vision stuff. We were streaming this on the ultraviolet spectrum, - the white and the infrared. - Yes. So let's say we provoked it. We provoked it. We recorded objects falling from the sky at an incredible speed, which seem to have similar characteristics to the Tic Tacs that Kevin Day witnessed in 2004. Our measurements of their size and speed are comparable to the findings of the the Scientific Coalition of UAP studies, and the scientific article by Dr. Knuth in Entropy. These in-depth scientific analyses of the Navy's Tic Tacs show similar size and estimated speeds, at tens of thousands kilometers per hour, as well as the objects we have captured on our FLIR cameras. We are getting confirmations from credible organizations as to the potential UAP properties, which is exactly what we need for this level of rigorous research. So, what kind of category would these things belong to? Physical objects, natural phenomena? Or mental manifestations? Is it in our heads? I doubt it, because we measure them - with scientific instruments. - Yes. We are not suffering a hoax. For me, it comes from from an intelligent creation and an intelligent construction. This is a technological device. It could be organic, or electromagnetic. Who knows? On the one hand, it could be ours, on the other hand, it's not. And the answer is somewhere in between. So I have an open mind. If it turns out that it's ours or other countries, that's fine with me. I'll have my answer. If it turns out that it's not from this planet, that's fine too. I'll have my answer. All that stuff, knowledge, information, engineering... to my knowledge, nobody on this planet knows how to do it. - Yes. - Right? So it would come from somewhere else, or from another time. And I think that's an important point. You mentioned the many cases. This is from 1951. We have objects with very high accelerations that take off at high speed. The pilot estimated that they were going at about 2,400 km/h, and they were tracked by radar from Newfoundland at 2,900 km/h. This is two years before the record of 1120 km/h was broken. So this thing is moving three or four times faster than the speed record. There are also declassified reports, thanks to the FOIA, mentioning flying white butane tanks. of flying white butane tanks. It looks a lot like like a Tic Tac to me. - That was the late 40s, early 50s. - Yes. I'll put that in perspective. Einstein, Rosen and Podolsky proposed these concepts from 1905 until 1913. So in about 100 years, that's all humanity had, as a basic concept, to say that exceeding the speed of light, wormholes or warp drives can exist. engines can exist. And it was only in 1994 that someone was smart enough, Alcubierre, to imagine the warp drive, who says that the physics that we have been learning since 1905 says that it is perhaps possible to do like in Star Trek and other movies and science fiction books. - But it's only been 100 to 120 years. - Yes. - Not thousands, not millions... - The universe is 13.7 billion years old. There is a civilization near us that is thousands of years old. Their Einstein was 10,000 years ago, for example. So where are they now? What if there are several civilizations with different technologies that use different things? - Sure. - Another thing, when space gets tight, the distances get shorter. - Space is not empty. - Yes, it is. We have about one hydrogen atom per cubic meter. When space is compressed at high speeds, we no longer fly in a vacuum but in a cloud. At a speed close to to the speed of light, your ship will explode in no time. Unless you have a technology that allows you to travel through matter without affecting it, as we see here with... This is an excellent point. ...machines moving in the air without a supersonic bang or in water without splashing. This is observed. This is data. This is the other argument that's always given. We did it, guys. We got a lot of interesting data. And I just wanted to tell you that I'm very proud of your work, it exceeds all my expectations. We got some great results, let's start preparing for the next part. The last five days have been very hard and exciting. We have managed to capture several anomalies in several places on several devices, in real time. This is a first in the field of ufology. What were the chances of finding the exact Navy Tic Tacs that they saw over their ship in 2004? It is now up to the scientists to continue to analyze the data over the next few weeks, to tell us about their properties and what this phenomenon really is. THE SCIENTISTS STUDIED THE COLLECTED DATA: 216,000 IMAGES PER HOUR X 600 HOURS OF FLIR 21,000 UFO DAP FILES THOUSANDS OF CONTINUOUS WAVE DATA 8 WEEKS LATER, THE TEAM MEETS AGAIN TO TALK ABOUT NEW ADVANCES... Hi, we're here. Good to see you. Sit down, because this is amazing. Come on, sit down. Okay. We want some anomalies. Is that so exceptional? Yes, and it starts with the list of anomalous events in the sky. I made a list of all the events that were either high energy, or high frequency, or both. The highest energy of cosmic rays we have recorded was 43.37 mega-electron volts, MeV. This is the highest for the entire week. Eight is the maximum for terrestrial radiation. Two MeV is the average. This high energy event occurred at 4:01 AM. - Right. - At 3:59 am, this is what the UFO DAP recorded. There is a hole in the clouds, which is not abnormal, a hole in the clouds that closes, but look at these strange dots. And if you go frame by frame, it closes in a fraction of a second. It looks too fast for natural cloud formations. For clouds to close the hole, they had to move at 1,100 km/h. How far was that? I can show you a diagram. - I've been studying this. - Great. This is basic trigonometry. We use the known angles, we know where the camera is aiming. We know the field of view of the camera... NUAGE CATALINA ISLAND - LAGUNA BEACH ...and this hole was at about 18 degrees above the horizon. So with a cloud ceiling at about 520 m, we can say that this hole was about 1.2 km from the coast. So this is an elliptical hole. - Okay. - It's about a quarter mile long and 100 m wide. Looks like a hole in the clouds. Or a virga hole. It happens with clouds at very high altitude some of which freeze spontaneously, and falls in the form of crystals which leave a hole in the cloud. This is not possible here because the ceiling was only at 520 m, and it was not cold enough for this kind of cloud. A hole like that could also be explained by be explained by an airplane flying through the cloud. There was no plane at that time and the UFO DAP cameras cameras did not detect any aircraft. The cameras started filming because they detected something. And when Jeremy slowed down the images, there's also a new point that appears in the last two frames. There are a few dots that appear. There is a new one. - A solitary dot appears. - One at the end, yes. Did you get the write-off data from outside agencies? Yes. We have the data from Fermi, the NASA telescope... GAMMA FERMI TELESCOPE ...which examines the gamma rays from a distant astrophysical phenomenon. There is no correlation. CURRENT WEATHER CONDITIONS CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS Solar activity was also studied. This event is not correlated with to solar activity. What about the FLIR? Anything? - Well... - Unfortunately, the FLIR... About seven minutes before this event, all eight FLIR cameras shut down. The power is gone. We had two power sources. I don't think it's a coincidence. It really bothers me because it reminds me how the phenomenon is often is often associated - to electromagnetic anomalies... - Yes. ...that cause breakdowns, cars stopping... It's really "convenient" that there was this problem. What to say to those who would say: "The camera may have experienced a malfunction." What would you answer? They were answered. A few minutes before the video we saw, we have another video where there are no spots, but there is the hole, a few minutes before. But still, we have a whole week of UFO DAP video and imaging that works perfectly. It spots birds and planes. And there's even a built-in classification system, which gives the percentage probability that it's a plane or a bird. In addition to that, we have direct controls of an almost identical part of the sky, with the day and the time. No holes, just clouds. And the cameras work perfectly. So there are too many strange coincidences, with all the events that have accumulated. It's easy to take a video and say it's this or that, that it's not abnormal because it could be anything, but it can't be anything because we did some calculations and we have correlations. So it's extremely unlikely that this is a malfunction that this is a malfunction. Any data consistent with with a weather radar or something else? Yes, we had weather data. Just before 4 a.m, a big area has a lot of turbulence, which is consistent with with the presence of this hole. The radar shows that there were reflective objects in the area. High energy particles and gamma rays would have bombarded the photographic sensor, giving spots uniformly distributed on the image. This seems to be physical objects appearing or materializing in the hole in the clouds. The radar return suggests that we see the objects through the hole in the clouds at a distance of about five kilometers. Thus, the objects are most probably between 10 and 15 meters, which is the estimated size of the Tic Tac objects during the Nimitz encounter in 2004. If we have something abnormal on different devices at the same time, it reduces the probability. This is why I have never accepted that I have never accepted the assertions that "The encounter with the Nimitz was just a radar malfunction." So the pilot's eyes deceived him at the exact moment where the radar had a problem. And the radar had a problem at the same time as the FLIR cameras. It is absurd to say that that several cameras and several different types of imaging different types of imaging have malfunctioned at the same time and gave the same thing. This is completely nonsensical. And so... What's that? How it looks like a hole that opens and then closes, it was called a wormhole, which made me, - obviously jump for joy. - I love it. WORMHOLE ANOMALY JULY 15, 2021 - 03:59 But we have to be careful because it would be, obviously, a major scientific discovery that would require a lot more evidence than we have. At worst, if it's not related to our main objective to look for evidence of non-human of non-human intelligence, this is a new phenomenon that no one has ever discovered. This is a new phenomenon unidentified and unclassified phenomenon. We add to the UAP... We extend the list of of unidentified objects. I forgot who said: "Most scientific discoveries are not 'eureka', but 'huh?'" Exactly. That's exactly what we have here. This is a moment where you think: "Huh, what's this?" Interstellar travel is one of those things of those things that are not impossible, but very difficult. And it's not impossible, even with the laws of physics that we know. What is fascinating is that at six years old, I thought that wormholes existed and allowed interstellar travel. I called them portals, back in the day. That's what made me dream of becoming a physicist. And here we are today. We are turning science fiction into real science. We could be headed for the big one "I told you so" in history. In 1935, Einstein wrote a paper with his student Nathan Rosen, creating the Einstein-Rosen Bridge. A bridge that could in principle allow to break the light barrier. Take a black hole, which is like a funnel, and put two of them back to back. Glue the two funnels together and you get a passage between two universes which would allow, in principle, to exceed the speed of light. These are wormholes. Is it possible? Yes, but you would have to be a very advanced civilization. What we see, for me, transcends reality. COLONEL JOHN ALEXANDER RETIRED FROM THE DEFENSE SERVICE AUTHOR OF "REALITY DENIED I am coming, personally, to multidimensional realities which periodically intersect. When they're here, when the realities intersect, they are physically there. But when they separate again this is no longer the case. So when we ask: "Where did he go?" "Where" is not even the right question. But it's very difficult to understand things that are rushing into physical reality and then dissipate into an apparent nothingness. There must be other life forms beyond. I am of the opinion that there are multiple interrelated phenomena. At the end of the day, we're trying to understand the nature of our reality. How these things can exist defying the laws of physics as we know them. Our consciousness is entangled in space itself, with everything we witness. We cannot deny an experience once we have had it. So maybe our fascination with the mystery of for the mystery of UAPs could come from an extraterrestrial life form visiting us. How do they get here? Maybe this is an opportunity to understand who we really are, our place in the cosmic map of the universe. What are a few thousand years for a galaxy that has billions of them? These other civilizations could be millions of years ahead of us, or perhaps millions of years behind. This is the scale of the galaxy. And that's why I think they're out there somewhere, and maybe even here. Our problem is that we assume that they are as primitive as we are. They can digitize their consciousness, put it on a laser beam and shoot the laser beam at the speed of light. What is at stake is our understanding of reality itself. An irrefutable credible incident would revolutionize our worldview. The only explanation that makes sense is that there is a higher intelligence that is more advanced than our technology. I think it will change the world. People will understand that there's something else out there besides us. It's not part of us and we can learn from it. It's a scientific revolution. - Good morning, Bill. - Good morning, Bill. Nice to see you again. I was looking forward to seeing your findings. - Oh, my goodness. - Is that right? That's crazy. - That much? - Crazy. Don't waste another moment. I want to see what you have here. I showed you some things that we found - that were very interesting. - Yes. It's not a bird, nor a plane, or a blimp... It's Superman! I mean... It's been identified with certainty. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to it. I can't believe it. - Take a good look at that side. - Okay. - Do you see that? - That's darker, yes. And then it gets lighter and it disappears. This is crazy! This is crazy. It's crazy! This is crazy. Has anyone else analyzed this? Everyone. Don't forget, our scientists took the data... - Yes. - ...for eight weeks non-stop to look for what it might be. It's a radiation emission, and look at that... - There's a... - A huge jump. Unbelievable. Exactly 43.37. Exactly at the same time as the opening and closing. Fits with the radar observation. - Yes. - They saw that cluster which happens to be exactly at the location of this anomaly. - So... - You with a peak - of radiation. - Exactly. You have a number. What you're saying, is that it's amorphous. It opens and closes, it contracts, it... We don't know anything like that. This is nothing humanly known. - Exactly. - We observe something and say: "How mysterious our world is." - We think it might be... - Okay. ...a wormhole. Some kind of a portal, some kind of a... And it expands and contracts? - Yes. - A wormhole separates time. - Yes. - Okay? And going through that separation, you change time. That's what the scientists are studying. This has never been explored in this way, and recorded and measured. I think that's wonderful. - Yes. - It's beautiful... - Yes. - ...to have spent all that time and expenses to observe phenomena that we don't know anything about, trying to measure them. That's great. That's wonderful that you're doing that. I hope that with our efforts, people will see that one can study this kind of thing without negative consequences and that we can know what it is. And I hope that in the future, people will come together. It took a lot of work to get to this point. Have proven what we've proven, and succeeded... Words fail me. I feel rewarded. And we changed the world. They went beyond my expectations. They supported each other. They solved all the problems... All I can say is, they're amazing people. I've never seen anything like it. It was like something out of a movie. And it wasn't the army, nor the government, just normal people who were looking for answers. And I like the fact that they're accessible, because the government is still classifying the data. The government is still hiding the data. But this is it. From a rooftop in California. Incredible scientists doing incredible experiments and research to see what is behind what is behind this UAP phenomenon, and it will change the culture the whole world. Scientists are going to have to take this more seriously if we want to understand this phenomenon. And indeed, we found evidence of strange events that cannot be dismissed with a wave of the hand. I will not be fooled into believing that this is a bird or a radioactive plane. This is absurd. This phenomenon is not a hoax nor an optical illusion. We have real anomalies. The next step of our work is to continue to analyze the nature and properties of these objects so that one day, we can finally draw definite conclusions what this phenomenon really is. Is it natural, artificial or extraterrestrial? We have launched something important in the field of UAP research. And whether it's a wormhole, a portal, a kind of stargate to other realities, we will call it for the moment "A tear in the sky." But there are things going on that we don't know about. I think that beings from other planets from other planets have visited the Earth. No, I don't think anybody told us that they came because we would be afraid. There are things we're not supposed to know. That's why they keep it secret. That's why there's a conspiracy. They are smarter than we are... No one is ready. ...and they don't want to be associated with a bunch of morons. They are at a level of scientific scientific advancement beyond our own, - as a species. - We've been inspired by them. They may be ahead of us or behind us, but we'll never know. They probably have the iPhone 21. They're just waiting for the right time to give that information to Apple. - If, let's imagine... - Yes. ...a spaceship was landing now... - Yes. - ...and an alien was saying: - "Bill, you're coming aboard with me"? - Yes. With great pleasure. I would accept and say: "Come in peace. We live in peace. "We want knowledge." I would go into the spaceship and let them give me a baby. I love it. The next time you are kidnapped by an alien civilization, for God's sake, steal something. A hammer, a pencil, an alien paperweight. There is no law against theft from an alien civilization. You won't go to jail without proof. The irrefutable proof that you were in that flying saucer. It's extraordinary that you would spend your time and money on this. If we could explain something that humans don't understand, for which we have a proven explanation and which has long been a mystery, that would only add to this book of knowledge that humans to fill every day. And if we could add a sentence, let alone a chapter, that would be wonderful. I'm very happy that you are venturing into what we see and don't see, and try to find an explanation. That's wonderful, and I wish you luck. Thank you.
