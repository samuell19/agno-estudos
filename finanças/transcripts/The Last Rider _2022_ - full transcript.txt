Everybody has a history, no matter who you are. Trauma changes a person. I've suffered a lot. All people see is the success. But there's a moment you hit breaking point. And so the Tour de France is in the mountains for the first time. The two greatest athletes in the world of cycling are battling out now, a point of honor. It's going to be the most exciting end in the history of the Tour de France. The yellow jersey has got dizzy. It's never known on whose shoulders it was going to be worn. The pendulum swings LeMond to Fignon and Fignon to LeMond. To win the Tour de France was my dream. But nobody had any clue what I was going through. Physically and psychologically, you can only handle so many blows. Now, look at this, as Fignon goes away, and Greg LeMond is losing the yellow jersey. This has been a most remarkable day in the Tour de France. Greg LeMond has cracked. So in my mind, Greg LeMond is at the end of his ability at this moment in the Tour de France. Take two. Mark. I was born in Los Angeles, California. I was a pretty wild kid. But when I moved to Lake Tahoe, I learned how to ski. That became my passion. Lake Tahoe is like a winter wonderland. You couldn't have grown up in a better place for loving the outdoors. And one of the preconditioning for skiing was bike riding. Went down and bought my first bike. My dad went with me, he bought a bike. We ended up starting to ride once or twice a week together, and I suffered the first two weeks, but within three weeks, I started feeling really good, and my dad did too, and I fell in love with cycling. We became riding partners. I mean, three or four days a week. And I'm gonna tell you, riding the Lake Tahoe, Reno, is like riding the Alps. We just got addicted to it. Cliff Young, who was a local racer, uh, just said, "Have you ever thought of racing?" And I'm like, "No." And he said, "Well, we're having a club meeting here in two weeks, uh, you should come by." So there were 40 riders. They had Italian shorts, they had the Italian tights, leather shoes, and, uh, I showed up in running shorts, tennis shoes, a T-shirt, maybe even a tank top. I end up staying with the group and sprinting to the top of the hill and getting second place. Everybody stopped, and they all came back to my dad and said, "Oh, you gotta get him racing, this guy. He's got a lot of talent." I definitely had the perfect combination of discovering a sport, but discovering it with my family. My dad got into racing, my mom loved it, and we had a Volkswagen van, and every weekend from February till October, we would go to races together. I never looked back at skiing again. It was bike racing from that point on. And the next year, I won every race I entered as a junior. By that year, I was as good as anybody in the country. It was very quick. I loved it. And I would look through the pages of every magazine from Miroir du Cyclisme to the British cycling magazines to the Italian magazine. And it was those photos, the-the beauty of cycling, watching the race, the drama, the face of-of these... these cyclists. I don't know how to explain it, it was truly magical. From an American's perspective, I would read these romantic, bigger-than-life descriptions of Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, and that's when I started just dreaming about... "Oh, what would it be like to race in Europe?" And then at 18, I went to Europe for the first time to finally watch the Tour de France. And it was the best atmosphere. The roads were just stacked with people. And that atmosphere, that energy, was probably the most magical thing I've ever experienced. Hot weather, some really steep, hard climbs, all the very best racers, and, of course, Hinault was the god. People could call me idealistic, but for me, the Tour seemed totally pure. It's everything I dreamed of. And I was like, "Okay, this is what I gotta do." 1979 was really my best year of racing, period. But most important thing that year is I met Kathy. All right, Kathy, take one. Mark. I walked into a Holiday Inn coffee shop and I saw my friend sitting at another table with a bunch of other cyclists. And, you know, I came up with my sister and said, "Hi." And we were just happy to be there, gonna watch them do this race. But Greg LeMond came over to the table to say "Hi," and I just was like, "Wow." And it was just like, "Oh, my gosh. Wow. That guy was really attractive." And it was not only that I thought he was physically cute, he had this positivity that I just loved. After the race, we said, "You know, should we go for an ice cream?" And when we got there, he spilled his whole ice cream over my arm. And then he was trying to lick it off my arm. And then he looked at me, and he said, "Is there just any way you'd ever go out with me?" And I'm like, "Oh, my gosh, yes, absolutely." And then we end up going to the beach on the lakefront. There was a lifeguard stand. We went up there and, uh, I kissed her for the first time, and... That was over. It was the best kiss ever. I just fell head over heels over this guy, and I guess he fell head over heels over me. Cyrille Guimard, take three. Take three. I got to the finish area, the hotel, and... Hinault's coach, Cyrille Guimard, came up and he was interested in signing me as a pro. Now that was a big deal for me. Because right when I started cycling, it was kind of like, "Oh, Americans could never compete against the Europeans." I mean, it was like they are on a different planet. So, for me, it was like, "Guimard's offered me a contract. Oh, my gosh." That was my dream. I went up and picked him up at the airport, and I don't even think we were out of the gate area when he told me that he had been offered a pro contract and he really wanted to take it, but we really needed to talk about what were we gonna do? And I said, "Well, I'll go with you." I was supposed to go to college and have this career. And so that was really a blow to my mom and dad when I left school. I had promised them that I would... would finish. We got married six months later, in December, and on January 9th, we flew over to France, landed in Charles de Gaulle, Bernard Hinault picked me up. It was an exciting period. Hinault was very famous and charismatic. But also, he was a great leader, great teammate. Bernard had chosen Greg as his successor. That's how it was. But as well as me, another young rider, Laurent Fignon, had also turned pro at Renault. It was such a different culture at that time. A hundred days of racing, 200 days a year in a hotel away from my wife. But it's almost what it takes to be really good. Cycling takes maybe 96% of your energy that you have for the day. All I wanted him to focus on was his career. That was good for both of us. So that helped me be strong enough to be alone 200 nights a year. They say he's really aggressive on the bike and everything, but at home, he's really calm, relaxed, everything like that. I definitely think Greg's the best. I'm prejudiced, of course. Welcome to the Tour de France, the most prestigious bicycle race in the world. Twenty-three individual races which combined, make up this 2,567-mile odyssey. Now, when you think about cycling, you tend to think about individual stars out to win for themselves and by themselves. But that's not really the case, because cycling is a team sport. It has team game plans, team strategies, and each rider on that nine-man team has a specific role with one end in mind, and that is to get their leader across the finish line in Paris first. And on my very first Tour in '84, Fignon got in there and won that Tour, and Hinault is really pissed. You know, Bernard Hinault was like this hero. We really felt so much respect for him... ...and how he was as a leader, and how he was conducting his life as a person. And so the next year, Greg did everything he could to help Hinault win his fifth Tour. He was like a brother to me. Not just his teammate. I knew I was good enough to win the Tour that year. But I was happy to sacrifice myself for my teammate. Bernard Hinault, five Tour wins. The American story, of course, another historic one for Greg LeMond from Washoe County, Nevada. A kiss from his wife, Kathy. Hinault recognized what Greg had done. So, Hinault, the next year, had made the vow, "I will help you win your first Tour." Going into the '86 Tour, having sacrificed myself for my teammate, I was confident he would follow through on his promise. An enormous crowd has turned out for old Bernard Hinault as he comes over the summit. So when that first talk started of Hinault wanting to go for it himself, we were dumbfounded. What will Greg LeMond be thinking now? Because the blaireau, the Badger is back. Bernard Hinault... ...finding the strength still to come up to this line, 1:18:47. Bernard Hinault is on top with a tremendous ride. You just don't expect one of your very best friends to screw you over... ...and give you a stab in the back. So, the Badger has come out of his corner once again to take on all the riders in the Tour de France. Four minutes, 36 seconds. Nobody would have ever said that Bernard Hinault would have won the day by such a margin. And now he's got the yellow jersey. He's French, he's a hero. Now the team was riding for him. I think he built up a six and a half minute lead. So I said, "Okay, I helped you win last year, now you're my adversary?" Eventually, I kind of go, "Okay, screw you." Boom, we're racing against each other. Bernard Hinault is a road in front. I was on fire. I mean, I was so strong. Now, what's this? A group coming up on him. And would you believe this? Greg LeMond has flown out of nowhere. All of a sudden, this Tour de France is once again an open race. And Hinault is beginning to lose ground. The cheers here for Greg LeMond. No American has ever won a stage in the mountains. Bernard Hinault will be extremely upset. One hundred meters to go. Every one of the likely contenders for this Tour this year has attacked today, and they're defeated fair and square by the American from California. LeMond, punches the sky. He already has his team backstabbing him. Then we heard, some of the other riders in the peloton had offered to take Greg out, so he'd be out of the race for Hinault. They say 80% of the riders want Hinault to win. There's a nasty hint that LeMond could be nobbled. And Greg said, "If you're gonna to do that, just tell me now and I'll quit. You don't have to hurt me." Was there a crash with Greg? No, no. Kent! No. What happened? He's just killing himself to win this thing by himself with no help. And, uh, I don't know what to say. I just... I just feel bad for him that he's all alone. Excuse me. But around that time, because of all the stress, I was starting to struggle with something else. I had a secret I had never talked about to anybody. When I was 13 years old, I was sexually abused by a family friend. I knew this guy probably since I was eight years old. He was grooming me at a very young age. He did what he did regularly. He'd come down for work and spend the night, one night, and then go back up to Tahoe. That lasted probably a year, year and three months. I didn't know how to tell my parents. You know, how do you tell them? Somehow you think you're responsible for it or somehow you willingly participated in this thing so that-- that's part of the shame. Bob and Bertha, they had no idea that Greg had been molested. And when Greg started cycling with his dad, this guy was no longer in Greg's life. And it was kind of this redemption. When you're a boy and you're molested by a man, you feel really a lot of shame. And the cycling was his path to feeling good about himself. I got so busy, got so into cycling, but it was always there, that was always there. And sometime one day down the road, no matter where you are, it comes back to hit you. When the deep pain of the betrayal from Hinault, when that cracked open, it was the first time as an adult that Greg had allowed himself to go back to the molestation. It's been a very bittersweet victory. I-I wish I could be... I think when I get to Champs-Elysées and it's over, I'll be happy, but it's... it's... I mean, it's hard to be happy right now. There's so much pressure, so much tension in the air. Uh, it's been difficult. Nobody had any clue what I was going through. His name in French means "The World", and this is the world of Greg LeMond in Paris today. The first American ever to pull on a winner's yellow jersey. When he got on the podium, he said to himself, "Oh, shit. Now I'm famous. This guy that molested me, he might come out and talk about it." I didn't have any joy from that Tour victory at all. They told me I had to show up at the team party at the Moulin Rouge. But we left that as quick as we could. After the victory, he was depressed. And it was awful because Jeff was two years old and I was five months pregnant. I mean, he was so kind of despondent. Just lost his patience emotionally, physically, and mentally. It was literally like exhaustion from the Tour, but exhaustion from emotional trauma. I did not look forward to racing the next year. We were scheduled to go back to Europe on the Tuesday after Easter. Greg's sister, Kathy, invited everyone over for Easter dinner and we were all there and his one uncle said, "You know, turkey season opens tomorrow. Why don't you come on up? We'll all go out hunting in the morning." And Greg's like, "Sure." And then Pat, her husband, decided to come on along. The next morning, it was really funny, because for some reason, he came back in the house. I mean, he had left the house and was on his way to his uncle's, but he drove back, and he said, "I don't even know if I really wanna go." I said, "Go. I mean, you never see your uncle, and it would be nice." We got up, 7:30 to the property, but I just remember feeling kind of weird that day. Anyways, you come up to this kind of a top of a knoll, and it falls down to a valley where the turkey would roost. When we walked out, I took the center line. My brother-in-law took the right line. My uncle took the left line. For some reason, I stood up, and I just heard this gun go off. I tried to scream and was gurgling blood. It was before eight o'clock in the morning. I was making pancakes and the phone rang and they said it was UC Davis Medical Center. They were sorry to tell me, but that my husband had been shot. You need to come as fast as you can. I called his sister, Kathy, and said, "I'm on my way. Greg has been shot." And I just was praying that he was alive. And so we arrived at the emergency room and I kept walking over to try and call to the operating room, "Nurse, can you tell me anything new?" And she was just like, "We're just trying to save his life." And so, Kathy and I were-- just sat there for a really long time. Oh, and somebody walked up to her from the hospital and said they needed to tell her that her husband was in a hospital across town. She said, like, "What? What happened?" And they said, well, he had tried to kill himself after he had shot Greg, he was so distraught, and he was in the psych ward there. And she said, "Do you mean Pat shot Greg?" I mean, she fell down on the floor just sobbing and she... I felt so bad, she kept saying, "Kathy, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry." And so I called my mom to tell her that. And while I was on the phone with my mom, she said to me, "What is that noise you're making?" And I said, "What are you talking about?" She said, "Are you in labor?" And I said, "I don't know. I don't know." And she said, "You need to call your doctor right now." I called my doctor and he came over and got me and he said, "You're clearly in labor. "We need to stop this baby." And he called up to the operating room and they said they almost had him into recovery. And my doctor actually got me into that room and he said, "You need to tell him that you love him, that you're gonna see him soon. Say everything you need to say. But let's go take care of this baby too, okay?" I walked in there and they had Greg suspended over the bed, and he just was dripping like a colander... And the sheet was just blood. When you see that blood on a white sheet, and it's... you know, somebody you love that much... And... it's just like I just... I just prayed he could be strong enough, because he had really been hurt. So I told Greg, you know, everything I wanted to say and then I just went off to the other hospital and Greg's mom came with me. They prevented Scott from coming for another three and a half weeks. Bicycle racer Greg LeMond, the only American to ever win the Tour de France, was hit by a shotgun blast while hunting in Sacramento. They put Greg in another hospital room down the hall from me. And I basically had the labor and everything all by myself, and then the doctor went and got Greg at the last minute. They brought in another bed into my room for Greg to lay down on because he was that weak. I still had 45 pellets throughout my body, one pressing right on the main artery. I mean, the cardiologist said, "I don't know how you survived this. You know, 100th of a millimeter more, you'd be dead." I'd have bled out instantly. And I lost 25 pounds of muscle mass and three quarters of my blood volume and a collapsed right lung. It wiped my body out. Two weeks or three weeks later, my team sent a letter basically a romantic, "loved working together," but basically, "you're fired." Go find another team. So in May, I stopped getting paid. All of a sudden, to go from a salary to zero. Greg had turned into a business. We were supporting everybody in the family. I mean, his dad worked for us, his sister worked for us. Pat worked for us. A lot of people worked for us and that was rough. The stress was incredible. I mean, I-I, you know, I had so many down days. I mean... I don't know how many times I cried. There was a lot of sensitivity over talking about the hunting accident because it was family. It wasn't it just like a third party shooting me. I mean, it was so painful to be around all that guilt that Pat and Kathy had. It was never back to normal. And how we related with Greg's parents or anything, it was not normal. I mean, honestly, that shotgun blast blasted apart our family. - It's hard. - This is really hard. After he got back on his feet enough, we flew with a couple week old baby and our toddler, and we rented a U-Haul motor home and we just, honestly, went to Montana. And we parked in a park. We did nothing but just be together. He slept, ate, fished, and finally got his will back for living. And then after he had healed enough, then he was ready to go to that next step of getting back on his bike. I think the first time I ever got on a bike was... the first week of June, and I rode a mile or two. I had a lot of pain after that. I couldn't breathe. My legs were just dead. You know, he was still in such a painful place. But he loved it. He really loved riding his bike. That's when I realized that regardless of what happens, I just need to get back into racing to prove that I can still win the Tour. My dad started enquiring about teams that might be interested. So the only team that would take me that year was PDM. I flew over to Belgium and did a small race, and I literally can only stay one mile with the peloton. After one mile, I had to pretend I had a flat tire. I spent that whole year on and off my bike, pretty much dropped in all the races. I mean, it was a nightmare. And then in '88, the Tour de France is going on. I wasn't strong enough to participate. The owner of the team, he calls up, "Greg, Greg, oh." He was so excited. "We have it, Greg. We have it," We'd just won l'Alpe d'Huez, Rooks and Theunisse, first and second place. We had the formula, the magic potion. He said, "Greg, you're gonna win more Tours than you ever thought possible." I'm like, "Okay, okay." I said goodbye. Two days later, Rooks and Theunisse tested positive. And I'm going, "Holy shit." And I said, "Kathy, I don't care. I would rather quit today than get back with the team. And imagine if I would have been taking something and I got positive, it throws away everything I did before. It destroys everything." There's no doubt that... Well, shame for anybody is-is traumatic, but, shame on the world level would be horrible. He was carrying so much shame before cycling, that cycling for him was this pure thing. It had none of the bad that he had lived before. And that is what I think gave him, you know, that strength, because he already knew what it felt like to do something you'd never wanted to do. He was never going back there. And now I have to find a team because I am not gonna race anymore with this team. But nobody approached me. I ran out of options. So I ended up signing the contract with a fly-by-night type of team called ADR. It was barely even enough money to provide for my family but if it wasn't for that, I would not have made it in the Tour. My first big race for them was the Giro in Italy. But when I got to the Giro d'Italia, I'm racing just horribly. It's hard to go from winning the Tour de France to realizing that maybe I'll just be a run-of-the-mill racer. And you win the Tour de France, you can't just be an-- A pack filler. It's impossible. I could never do that. He called from Italy. Honestly, everything really stunk at that time. I broke down. I mean, it was like, not just like a talk. I mean, I was crying. I was like, "I can't do this anymore. I just wanna quit tomorrow." And I said, "I just wanna scream at everybody. I don't fucking care if I ever race again. Get over it. Get over it. Stop." I was worried, so I, honest to God, got on the plane with the kids and flew straight out there. I found him in the hotel, and I just said, "You don't ever have to ride again. If you wanna quit, go ahead and quit. But do everything you can to just get through it. If you never come back, we'll just-- we'll be fine." "I would work as a cashier at Kmart." I said to him. "Whatever happens, happens." I think her giving me permission to quit, it was like a pressure valve getting released. The next day, I felt like, "Screw it, I'm just gonna ride, you know. I'm just gonna see how I feel. I'm not gonna put any expectations." I'm gonna go at my pace and, uh... And that's when I started, psychologically, I was free. And I ended up finishing the race. There were three weeks between the Giro and the Tour de France. And I came up with a plan. To do the Tour, and if it doesn't work out, I'll be okay with it, but I'll do everything I can until then. And I knew this would make or break. You know, I'm gonna make it or I'm gonna be done. If it is true, as the French say, that the culture, taste, and the history of the world begins in Paris, then this year, the reverberations will be felt like never before. Paris and all of France is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Eiffel Tower, the bicentennial of the French Revolution, and the origin, 86 years ago today, of a cycling event known as a Tour de France. The race, set in just over three weeks, will finish up here on the Champs-Elysées. It's a summer of celebration in the City of Light. One take four. After the Giro, I was optimistic, I was hopeful, but still, I was so far from actually having confidence. I was just happy that things were going the right way. As I went to the start, I'm going, "If I could be a stage win and top 20, I'll be happiest, you know... ...I've been since I won the Tour de France". I remember sitting there with his dad and being so anxious. It was gonna show, really. Was he even gonna be there? Greg LeMond has been very honest about where he expects to finish. But he says that a comeback to the level that you need to be at to win the Tour de France is not something that happens overnight. And LeMond is on a good time. He's into the home finish. It's not gonna take Breukink, but it's gonna put him up, up on top of the leaderboard amongst the men who matter. Look at that! Second place to Greg LeMond. Great ride. And it was just this little jump in your heart like, "Well, I don't know. I mean, that was pretty good." Laurent Fignon... ...who's suddenly become the popular French number one again after his great victory in the Tour of Italy, and just before the Tour de France. Although he has his personal battles with the press and this is the only way he can get back at everybody. Fignon looks as if he's confirming that he's got the form... ...and could be one of the boys for this year's Tour. Well, let's see, 10:00.48. He's just knocked Greg LeMond out of second place with that performance. The double winner now challenging for a third time. Uh, it's a very good start for me. Usually, if I'm in the top ten in the prologue, I'm gonna have a good Tour de France. But still, I have no background to go by. I can't say if I'm gonna be very good for three weeks, but I know I'm gonna have some very good days. The last man to go, of course, Pedro Delgado. The million-dollar effort of the Reynolds team to win the Tour de France is receiving a poke in the eye for its star and last year's champion Pedro Delgado is late. Very late. Stop. What a sensational start to the Tour de France this is. Twelve minutes, 48.3, included in that time is a late start. As we go into day two, Delgado, the winner in '88, 198th out of 198 in the field. So I did the first week with Greg. He was still so unsure of his physical capabilities. So he was taking it day by day, and that's where we were at. I raced very cautiously. I had not been in the front of a pro peloton like the Tour de France since the '86 Tour. Today's time trial, 73 kilometers, 45 miles. Anyone with designs on winning this race will have to put a good performance in today. Time trial is the foundation of cycling. A lot of other events, even a marathon, you're competing against other people, but a time trial's against yourself. And so, it takes an incredible amount of concentration and drive to succeed. And it really is a race of truth today. Delgado will either remain... ...in this Tour de France as a challenger, or he will drop out of contention completely. Delgado rode the whole event in sunshine to his ride of one hour and 38 minutes and 36 seconds. As you can see now, we are in the middle of a torrential rainstorm. Look at this fight back by Fignon in the second half of the race. The years he won the Tour de France, he was a great time trialist. Now, he's coming back. LeMond's 39 and nine on the line, the perfect... Greg was one of the best time trialists in the world before the accident. So, for us, it was all, "Was Greg gonna be good? Was he gonna be himself, or even a shade of himself?" And Greg LeMond is coming up to the line. He's producing some terrific form here now. Gently around the corner, 200 meters to go. And Greg LeMond is announcing his return to the top flight of cycling. Now he's going top of the leaderboard in the Tour de France. 1:38:12 for Greg LeMond. What a fantastic ride. What an amazing day it really has been. The new yellow jersey of the Tour de France now by just five seconds is the American Greg LeMond. I remember screaming my head off at home on the couch with the kids. If that's all I did for that Tour, that would have been good. I got into the yellow jersey, man, that felt so good. I actually have goosebumps thinking about it, like... Just the sheer pleasure of having that yellow jersey put back on him. We just couldn't believe this miracle had happened. For me to be back, it was just joy. Bernard Hinault wasn't there. All that pain and suffering was gone. I told Kathy, "This is my race, this is me, this is my race." Do you think you can win the Tour de France this year? I wanna say I would like to, I would love to win the Tour, but I wanna be realistic. I think we've got some-- I've got some very tough competition, Fignon and, uh, Delgado, and Andrew Hampsten. There's a lot of good riders out there that are gonna be tough to beat. And I don't-- I'm not sure if I have what it takes to last three weeks in the mountains, uh, and recuperate every day. That's what I'm most afraid of. So we were just, you know, enjoy it while you can. This is great. And he kept saying, "I think I'm good, but I don't know if I can climb." The first challenge was gonna be Pyrenees. The Tour will be won and lost over the course of the next few days as the riders take on first the Pyrenees, and then just for good measure, the Alps after that. That's it, it's 1,000 meters to the line now. And all the Spaniards out today. Delgado couldn't let these people down, could he? Delgado looks over his left shoulder, and I think this is the first time I've seen Delgado actually show pain, because he always looks as though he's never feeling the mountain, but he wants time, he wants every second he can squeeze out of those legs over the riders behind, because he won't get another chance now until the Tour goes into the Alps. Delgado goes for the gears. He slips it up one. A little bit further behind them, we've got Laurent Fignon here after a series of attacks trying to get clear. Fignon has come back. LeMond is third here. My goal was to stay in the front, but make sure I'm out in the wind. LeMond will keep out of trouble as much as he can. We get to the top of Superbagnères, where the pace going up there was pretty fast for me. I was holding on until the last kilometer. A lot of times, when you're having a rough time and somebody is attacking you, if you can immediately respond, they'll slow down. So, I had this tactic where Fignon attacked and I immediately responded. And I stayed with him, he slowed down. But I was at my limit. And I was like, "One more attack and I'm done." And Greg LeMond is feeling the pressure this time as Fignon goes away. And it looks to me as though Greg has cracked. Greg has looked over for help here. The five seconds is going, so is the yellow jersey. Greg LeMond is losing the yellow jersey as he comes to the top of this climb. This has been a most remarkable day in the Tour de France. Greg LeMond has cracked. As they say in cycling, he's hit the wall. Laurent Fignon will be in yellow tonight. And in more than five days, Fignon's in enormous gear, he knows he's got the yellow jersey because Laurent Fignon is now the new leader of the Tour de France. As soon as we finished, he critiqued me for not racing like Tour leader. As though because you have the yellow jersey, you should be in the front, pacing everybody. You are the lead of the Tour. You must defend that jersey who sits in advance. You should have a leader attitude in the race. And I think that Greg was just not having it. He was letting me do all the work. I was second, even if it was a five seconds' difference. I do remember, I'm going, "You son of a bitch. You have no clue what I've been through the last two years, three years. Do you? You don't even know that I'm just happy to be here." The next morning, I said to Laurent, I said, "Listen, you better shut your mouth. "I saw you, Andy Hampsten saw you. You held on to a motorcycle yesterday. You should be out of the race. You shouldn't even be talking right now." Another scorching hot day then of the Tour de France. At the moment, it's all going right for the leader. Very confident rider this year, Laurent Fignon. And the yellow jersey and the seven-second advantage is safely conserved by Laurent Fignon. That whole time I'm thinking, "You cocky son of a bitch." I knew it would be my time to succeed once we got to the Alps. Fignon picking on Greg, I mean, Fignon did that with a lot of the riders. But Greg's not a wimp. He wasn't gonna take it. And Greg punched back. We are in the Alps, where the eventual winner of this race will emerge. Today, it is, of course, the most crucial time trial in the race. Twenty-five miles of tough cycling. There are two first-category climbs en route. The only downhill section on this course is the six feet out of the start cabin. Now, the Spaniards call him Perico, that's his nickname. He's climbed back into the leaderboard without a shadow of a doubt with this performance. Goodness knows what he's holding in store now for the rest of the race. And for everybody now, he must be seen as a favorite for Paris in a week's time. Well, this is Greg LeMond coming round the corner. He was ten seconds behind Delgado at Orcieres. And now Greg LeMond is fighting back all the way. LeMond is back in this Tour de France, and this Tour is certainly not won or lost by Greg LeMond or Pedro Delgado. 1:11:39 for fifth place. That is a marvelous ride. I know Fignon, because I know he gets cocky. So he is gonna start off that time trial like, "I've got this one. Don't worry about me." Laurent Fignon is riding now a little bit ragged. He's rolling around. He's not riding as composed as he might be. Fignon, last kilometer. It looks as if Fignon is really suffering there, trying to keep hold of his yellow jersey. That's where I just shut him up. But one thing is now certain, Laurent Fignon is definitely losing the lead as he tries to salvage a couple of seconds on the line. Tenth place, 1:12:26 for Laurent Fignon. Laurent Fignon has lost his lead in the Tour de France. It's gone back. The pendulum swings again in the direction of the American Greg LeMond. And we're now heading in for the final phase of this year's Tour de France, and what a great race it is. Pedro Delgado has said he has only one rival for victory in Paris, Greg LeMond. He's no longer counting Fignon. Laurent Fignon said in the papers that he may no longer be in a position to win the Tour de France, but he is in a position to stop Greg LeMond winning it. It's left no friendship between LeMond and Fignon. They're on the big climb today over the Izoard. We watch Delgado go. Delgado has attacked, and now he's accelerated to try and steal what he can. The next day in Col d'Izoard, Pedro Delgado attacked and I stayed with him right behind, stayed on the wheels. Look at the reaction from Greg LeMond. Well, that's amazing. He's keeping in contact with Delgado. And it's certain. If Delgado can't get rid of Greg today, it's touch-and-go now. It looks as if Greg might well take that yellow jersey back up to Paris. I was racing better. Absolutely. I was leading the Tour. I felt so good. The unthinkable may be happening. And the man who's gone missing, Laurent Fignon. I felt even better when he got dropped on Col d'Izoard. And I took another 12 seconds out of him. Now, it looks like Laurent Fignon is in trouble. Fignon's come off the back here. Greg LeMond now surely looking like the winner of the Tour de France. LeMond has become stronger and more confident every day of this Tour de France. He's going to believe in himself again. This is Al Trautwig reporting live, where night-time is settling in on the French Alps just before 9:30 local time, and joining me is the man who stirred up all the excitement today, Greg LeMond, who for the second time wears the yellow jersey in this race. Greg, before the race started, you said top 20. A couple of weeks in, you said top five. Now, Paris is a week away and you lead the race. Are you getting close to tasting it? Oh, I think if it came down to be who's the best rider, I think I have as good a chance as anybody to win this race. In fact, maybe better than most. I remember feeling great there. It was after that race that I go, "Okay, maybe I'm gonna win the Tour here." For me, anything goes in this race as long as it's a tactic to win the race overall. And I'm gonna do whatever I can to win this race overall. This is it. The climb of Alpe d'Huez. Five miles below us down that dark hole is the village of Bourg d'Oisans. That's where the climb starts and then the road just lies on the mountain here, like a piece of discarded string. We're expecting a marvelous fight between Pedro Delgado and Greg LeMond. We came up here at eight o'clock this morning and we estimate over half a million people on the slopes of the climb. That will be a record crowd. This is where the Tour de France, we feel, will be decided. Will it be LeMond in yellow tonight or Pedro Delgado? And Fignon surely is a surprise now. Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon. Delgado, again, is not evidenced on the lower slopes of Alpe d'Huez. And I felt actually really good at the bottom of that. But at one point, I started struggling. I don't know what happened or if it was just the accumulation of fatigue, but I started to crack 10ks up the climb, started running out of juice. Guimard was a car behind, and he could see my shoulders dropping. And I had the yellow jersey, our team car's leading, Fignon's second place, Guimard's here. That's how the cars go. And José knew that Guimard knew me. Guimard's gonna try to get up there. There was no radios at that point. And he's gonna tell Fignon to attack. And José De Cauwer blocked him. And he blocked him and he kept him off, I don't know, a kilometer, two kilometers. Both cars were destroyed. They had dents everywhere. And finally, Guimard got around him, went to Fignon and said, "Attack." And he was sitting next to me. He's got his window... "Attack, attack!" And Fignon said, "I can't." And he's screaming, "You better attack!" Basically, like you're fired if you don't. And there's Fignon having a go with four to go. Laurent Fignon lost a few seconds yesterday. He's gonna take them back and more. LeMond must react. LeMond could lose the yellow jersey here. And I just blew. Boom. And, man, I struggled. Got into my aerobic limit. Delgado's reacted straightaway there. Look at Greg. Greg is cracked up. He can't get the wheel. He can't follow Delgado. Delgado's gone away. Laurent Fignon's up the road in front. And Greg is really suffering to get that rhythm going. Now is the time when Greg's got to dig really deep into his reserves and come back again. Greg LeMond, he's allowed a springboard for Fignon. Now, Delgado looks over his shoulder and sees at last Greg LeMond is not with him. The crowd now who've waited at the top of the mountain for a week, many of them to see the action, now are getting what they came for. The big battle in the Tour de France. And the surprise of the day, Laurent Fignon, where has he found the strength from? Laurent Fignon, who was in all sorts of difficulties, has sprouted wings now on Alpe d'Huez. And I struggled. It was painful. And there is Greg LeMond in the yellow jersey. It must seem a desperately long way to go now to the top of Alpe d'Huez today. There is confirmation. The gap between LeMond and Fignon on the yellow jersey classification is 53 seconds. And Laurent Fignon hits an enormous gear. As we go down to the kilometer, Greg LeMond still fights on, hoping to save just the odd second or two, still fighting to keep his final hopes alive for the yellow jersey in Paris on Sunday. Greg LeMond will finish fourth in one of the most sensational stages of Tour de France for years. He was pretty down after he got dropped on Alpe d'Huez. When you first just get beat, it hurts, and he feels like he's... "Ugh. I couldn't do it. That means there's a weakness in me. He's stronger than me. How am I gonna do this?" I didn't have as good a day as I'd hoped, but I think I raced a very good race. I... You know, it's just that Fignon happened to be a little better than me today. And he took advantage of it. 228 eight miles to go in the Tour de France on the morning after the emotional ride to Alpe d'Huez. LeMond's number is reattached to the team shirt, as the Tour tug of war now favors Fignon. Both are refueled as the start of the stage draws near. And now we can go onward to the climb off the coast of d'Oisans. We're looking here at the leading group in the Tour de France today. And Fignon now riding high on this Tour de France. He's trying to push home the advantage. So, Fignon is now trying to leave the whole of the Tour de France in his wake. LeMond will have to reply to this because Greg LeMond cannot afford to lose even a few seconds now. So, Fignon, his personality was such that when he dropped me in Alpe d'Huez, it emboldened him. The next day, he attacked again. Unfortunately, I was really struggling. I was suffering. It's Laurent Fignon who's going clear again. The man you don't expect to attack, somehow finds the reserve and the cheek to do it. It's being left to Delgado to drag Greg LeMond back into the race and LeMond there doesn't seem to be able to help Delgado. Well, at the moment, Fignon is actually going away and Delgado's given up. He's swung across to say, "Well, look, Greg, you're the man who wants to win the Tour de France. It's up to you to do it." They've completely stopped racing. They've completely stopped racing. Delgado is fed up of making the pace. He's accelerated again now. LeMond there, quite obviously was not gonna defend his position. Neither was Theunisse. And we could well be looking at the moment in this marvelous Tour de France when the three riders have admitted that Laurent Fignon is the best. LeMond, quite clearly, who in my mind is at the end of his ability at this moment in the Tour de France. I was racing with a big handicap all the way through there. I do believe that being shot really impacted my body. I have probably 45 pellets in me. And, uh, by that point, the race started taking so much energy out of me. He's in sight of the finish now, as he puts his head down. He's gonna snatch every second. When he swings round this corner, then you'll see the finish. And the crowd are standing up here, their hands above their heads, they applaud Laurent Fignon because he knows that today he won the Tour de France, I'm sure of that. The seconds countdown as Fignon salutes the crowd, he's finally shown the rest of the riders in the race that he really is the best rider. Watch the clock now. And this was kind of a blow. Two bad days. We're looking at the winner of this year's Tour de France, Laurent Fignon. But I had started thinking about everything that I had worked for, everything that I had accomplished. And so, losing made me re-evaluate what I wanted to do. First question we must ask, 50 seconds now, is that too much to win the Tour de France for you? Uh, considering the distance of the time trial, it's gonna be a difficult task to do. Uh, if it was a 50-kilometer time trial, I think there would be some very good hope that I could, and it's still not over. But, uh, it's... it's less likely today. It's, uh... I've done my best. I just, you know, Fignon, yesterday and today, has been extremely strong. So, the next state was almost like the race is over, like, everybody's kind of going, "Thank goodness we're done." Well that's Fignon just, uh, just stretching his legs a little bit. I think he's just going to show that he's still strong and if they want to play around, he can any time. I knew that I was not gonna make up the time that day, no matter what. We were probably 50ks from the finish. Fignon came up and tapped me on the shoulder. We shook hands. Congratulations on the second place. And I remember thinking about, why is he acting that way? He's got the yellow jersey. I mean, what is it that you have to be bitter about? This is the beautiful chateau of Versailles, which is now a monument of French history. Last weekend, the French celebrated the bicentennial of the revolution when they marched on the chateau and took out the monarchy of France. Now today we have another battle starting outside of its gates. The battle between a Frenchman, Laurent Fignon, and an American, Greg LeMond. Just 50 seconds between them after more than 2,000 miles of racing, and it comes down to the time trial, the race of truth between two men. One thing I'm very confident about and that is this Tour de France will be the closest finish in the history of the race. Sitting with my mom and Greg's mom, and kids are there. And Dad's like, "Well, I think he's gonna win it." And I said, you know, "Knock it off. Second at the Tour de France? This is beyond our wildest dreams. Let's just be grateful." We join now Greg LeMond out on the course. Let's see how he goes today. He's just got to produce pure speed. It's not just got to be the best time of the day, he's got to win by almost a minute. I know that if I just push myself, everybody else is gonna have to push themselves to beat me. I don't care if it's Fignon, Hinault, anybody. And as we watch Fignon depart there, all the cheers, the shouts here will be for Laurent. Well, Fignon has never, ever been in front of Greg LeMond in a time trial in the Tour de France. Today is the day to do it. You can see the yellow jersey going through the streets of Paris being worn by a man who lives here. We saw him turn his head back there. Fignon will be getting time checks all the way along the route here from his team manager, Cyrille Guimard. Well, Greg's still down in that aerodynamic position using probably the white line down the middle of the road to keep himself in the middle and away from trouble. And I'm watching live French TV at the finish line. I just didn't see how he was gonna do it. I know it's gonna be within seconds now, I'm not taking any splits or anything, so as good as I feel, I still don't know where Fignon was. I could have been going great. He could've been even better. So whatever I did was my maximum. If I lost the Tour, I lost it. Well, Phil, at the moment, we've got Fignon's time coming through at 21 seconds behind Greg LeMond at the first 11 kilometers point, the half distance. Fignon has lost half his lead on LeMond at the moment. Greg LeMond is riding for his life here. I'm going all out, I'm doing my best and I'm pacing myself. I get into this mode of just kind of visualizing what I have to do. Both riders worthy of winning the Tour. Phil, it's incredible to watch LeMond here because the top half of his body is hardly moving at all. It's just that little twitch when his head goes down to get himself into that aerodynamic position. He picks his head back up again to look where he's going, and the power that's coming out of his back and out of the top of his thighs must be incredible when you think this man has still got 67 pellets in his back from that shooting accident. Twenty-nine seconds, folks. Greg LeMond could still do it. Well, it looks like it's gonna be even decided actually on the Champs-Elysées there, because the little climb from the Place de l'Etoile up to the bottom of the Arc de Triomphe, is one of the hardest roads in the world when you've come this far. Thirty-two seconds is now the time gap. Eighteen seconds, Paul, is what he's got to do on the Champs-Elysées. I mean, I kept saying to my mom, "He looks so good." And then I would see the time checks and then I thought, "Oh, my God, I think he might be able to do this." Now, the cheers! Greg LeMond is on the Champs-Elysées, and the gap is 35 seconds ahead of Laurent Fignon. If Fignon can come back, he's always been renowned for his comebacks in time trials. I really don't know which way to bet at the moment, Phil. You cannot bring the race to a finer finish than that, and you could never script it in a hundred years. Just seeing him so powerful, like going up the Champs-Elysées, like, you see them across the road before they make the turn around the Arc de Triomphe and come back down. And I knew it was close. You can see he's really suffering, Greg. This is the last part of the Tour de France for him. He's got to empty everything he's got out of himself. Very shortly, Laurent Fignon will join us on the Champs-Elysées. He will get one enormous cheer. Greg LeMond makes his turn to home now where he needs a top speed of 40 miles an hour. He gets back into his rhythm very, very quickly. He'll get into the streamlined position. He'll grit his teeth and he'll put his head down, and he'll just go for home in a dead straight line. There's the cheer. Laurent Fignon is on his way up, and there he is while Greg LeMond is on his way down. The two greatest athletes in this year's Tour de France and in the world of cycling are battling out now a point of honor, a point of pride for the greatest finish in the Tour de France. Phil, it's 48 seconds now, with three kilometers to go for Laurent Fignon. The gap is 48 seconds, Phil. This is the most incredible thing I think I've ever seen in my life. This is Pedro Delgado. Greg LeMond is catching him. Delgado will now finish over four and a half minutes behind in this year's Tour de France. Not only that, Phil, but he's gonna also win the stage, I think. 'Cause look at that time, 26:57. He goes into top place. We've got two minutes and 50 seconds now to wait for Laurent Fignon to arrive. Oh, Greg! I love you! Well, Fignon's time has got to be better than 27:47. Greg LeMond has turned in the performance of his life. We're still being told the difference is 48 seconds. Two full seconds between two riders who have totally refused to concede defeat whenever they have gone out on the bicycle every day. The yellow jersey has got dizzy. It's never known on whose shoulders it was going to be worn the day after. We're beginning the countdown as the crowd leaps forward and Fignon suffers all kinds of hell out there now. So when I crossed the line, I'm just wanting to know what's the lead? What's that? It was a lot of confusion. At the finish, Greg LeMond listens to French radio analyze the numbers. He still is not sure if he was fast enough. Let's move on! I'm trying to see Fignon, and I know it's gonna be close, but it's like you're waiting to find out. Well, Fignon's got 43 seconds to do it, Phil. It seems like an awful long way. He's given everything. Look at that armada of motorbikes behind him. It's just gonna be on the line, so it's gonna be one or two seconds either way. I really don't know what. It's incredible. So the Tour de France comes down to the climax, the climax... it's always threatened it would be. These two men have been Siamese twins throughout the race. Now the cord is broken and it looks like Greg LeMond might... But look at the finish by Fignon. They're all turned off. It's gonna be close. 27:47. He must do. The clock is counting down, so it'll be just to the line. This is going to be incredible. Fignon is bouncing off the barriers here. He's lost the Tour de France. The crowd has realized it. Laurent Fignon has lost the Tour de France right on the line. He has lost the Tour de France by eight seconds. Can you believe that? And Fignon has fallen over right in the crowd and collapsed on the floor. It was like, "Oh, my gosh," like, "I won the Tour." Did he win or not? It was just the freakiest thing because Bernard Hinault came. You know, with all of our past with Bernard Hinault, he grabs me and he's pulling me across the finish line to go to Greg because he can see that Greg's trying to run to me. But I thought it was just so extraordinary that it was Hinault that was being so helpful. It was full circle. Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! And I went running, looking for Kathy, because I went there to say, "Can you believe this? I was ready to quit. And I won the Tour." And so for me, that was, um... It... Anyways, it was-- it was a powerful moment. I can't believe it! Oh, my God. Like, just hugging Greg was just like the best feeling. Like just, "Oh, my God, you really did it. You're back, you're alive, you really did this." How does it compare with 1986, - when you think about that? - Nothing compares. Nothing, nothing, nothing. After all the arithmetic about the time trial, did you really think that it was gonna be possible? I thought it was possible, but, I didn't know until I crossed the line. Unbelievable. Kathy's reaction. Kathy? - I can't believe he did it. - What's your feeling? - I never believed he could do it. - Did you think he could do it? No. I thought, like, 1%. So incredible. I can't believe it. It was such a relief. I just can't even tell you. It was more than just the joy of winning the Tour de France. It was the relief of, "He's back." And it had been a long, long journey. This is the end of the Tour de France. And Fignon is down on the floor and amongst that crowd. We make his defeat eight seconds. Can you believe it after over 2,000 miles, we've come down to the last 200 meters? The equal of our joy is gonna be the depth of his sorrow. It was tough for him. And there it is, the yellow jersey. Geoffrey looks at it, Greg LeMond puts it on. I could tell he was stunned on that podium, and I just said, "Hey, you know, you did a great race. This was a great battle between us. Now you've got two, I've got two. Let's do this again next year." Something like that. Well, I'm happy. What can I say? It's just... Where did it came from? I... I won the Tour de France before. Everybody thinks that the talent goes away, but it doesn't go away. And I feel like I'm one of the most talented riders in the peloton and I proved it today. But the strength really came from my family and, and my friends, my masseur, Otto Jacome, and my father-in-law, mother-in-law, everybody that's really close to me. But you did it yourself. I did it with the aid of everybody. But, uh, I'd say that the biggest aid was my family. '89 was unlike any other victory I had. At that time, it felt like everything that I worked for, everything that I dreamed of, was taken away when I got shot. So, to go through those two years, to literally wanna quit multiple times, to win that race after being so low was, you know, it's kind of like the best title you'll ever have. When I first saw Greg's mom, she was just sobbing and she just was like, "You know, now that heartache for Kathy can heal," for her daughter and son-in-law, who were carrying so much of a burden after wounding Greg. I knew that they suffered in terms of, of, you know, you're the brother-in-law that shot Greg, almost killed him. So he has that guilt. He feels that obligation. So winning that was almost like we were able to put that past behind us. Well, I think you could actually see the relief for his mom and dad. It meant the end of that nightmare. When you go through trauma, it takes a little bit of that shield away. That's one layer of your shield. And then another trauma takes another one. No doubt after I got shot, that was the breaking point for me. You talk to somebody who's minutes from death, you know, you kind of get stripped pretty bare, down to what's really, really important. And I think that this hunting accident created this second trauma in our family just widening Greg's, you know, raw opening. And cycling was always this place that he got this validation. He was really, really good at something. He had carried a lot of shame in his life before cycling. And with cycling, it was this pure and good thing. And now he was back. Yeah, things just changed after that. I was optimistic. Gone were the doubts, self-doubt. Um... In fact, I just felt I was absolutely back to normal. And I really was. I think I won the World Championships four weeks later. I do believe it took that long to come back. He's got it. The World Championship title to Greg LeMond. When I look back realistically, I go, oh, my gosh, that was really a quick comeback even though it was torturously slow for me. I do not quit as a person, even though I want to. And I think part of that resilience has been Kathy. She was truly the foundation that kept me going. Together, honestly, I think we can do anything we have to do. And I know when I won in '89, it was kind of a healing race that was part of the joy for everybody, for my whole family.
