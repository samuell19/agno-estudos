Don't do that. Oh, I'm so sorry! Here, we don't. It's broken. Great light. Indeed, especially in the morning. You know, there's a lovely courtyard in the back. You should take a look. Can we afford this? It's a good deal. Whose stuff is this? Yeah, this is all from a previous tenant. And you know, it's been unoccupied for some time, as you can see, but you know, all this stuff, you can take it, leave it. You can do whatever you want. Could we get it cleaned, though? I'm sorry. Could cleaners come? Why? It's just kind of dirty. Don't you have a broom? Shall we see the bedrooms? Here, I'll follow you up, there's more to see just right up this way. - Okay, thank you. - After you. So this bedroom comes equipped with a Murphy bed, you can keep it up or you can bring it down. Really as you wish, which is nice. But you have to walk through this room to get to the other one. Hmm. Well, you see, actually, if you go through here, you'll see that each room has a separate entrance. Great. Addie you can take this room. But the rooms are connected. No, they look... they have separate locks right here on the doors. Okay, but how does that work? I suppose whoever gets there first gets to lock the other one out. Or in. I'm not gonna lock you in. Relax. And look, you get a little doorway out into the hall. But I only have access to the rest of the apartment through this hallway. No... yeah, that's good. I can't have you going in and out of my room all the time. You know, it's a little private entrance for you. - That's true. - Yeah. Oh. Also I've gotta show you... Don't! - Sorry. - It's annoying. Settle. Oh, for each side, bro Town. - It's nice of you. - Yeah. Let's get drunk to celebrate. I really want to, but I have to learn my lines. Well, we're uptown girls. It rocks. No! Oh, I have to focus. Take it. Okay, fine. Ooh. Chin chin! Eww, it's so warm, Uh, it's room temp. It's it's an acquired taste. Okay, but that's disgusting. It's not. It's very sophisticated. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Eww. What the... Oh God. Oh God. Is there somewhere we could donate the rest of these? It's expired. Well, it's not all expired and it just seems pretty wasteful. Okay, so you want to donate mostly expired poisonous food to poor people? I'm just trying to be considerate. Poverty mentality. What? Poverty is a mindset. Rich dad, poor dad. Your dad is poor. Does he have poverty mentality? My dad's not poor. You're just really rich. I am not rich. My family has money, but... Money they should give us. Well, they don't, so... Why don't you just ask. You know my dad. I can't answer. Yeah, you can. It's almost Christmas. Come on, I'm Jewish. Okay, well, that doesn't matter. I don't get Christmas presents. Whatever. Your dad would have written a cheque. He's not emotionally invested in you. He doesn't care. You're right. But he would have written a cheque and he owes it to you anyway 'cause he fucked you up so badly. Okay, Noelle. What? Please stop. You love been a victim. I'm a survivor. You're a victim and you love it. What are you? A high functioning, emotionally stable person? Okay. Why have you never had a boyfriend before then? Because I'm not you. I don't seek validation from men. Or a real job. - Your job is not real. - Yes, it is. You're an aspiring actress! You make videos of yourself doing pretend shit on your phone all day. It's called a self-tape and it takes a lot of courage. Hey. - Hey. - What are you doing? Smudging. What's smudging. All kinds of space. It smells really nice. No gets rid of bad vibes. Yeah, um, about that. I'm really sorry, but I was earlier just being a bitch. It's okay. It's not. It was so unnecessary. Oh, it is. I'm excited to live here. It's gonna be so cool, you know, making it nice... make it more us. Definitely. Hey, could I sleep in your bed with you tonight? Addie? Come on, it'll be fun. Just like Salvatore first night vibes. Just tonight. Greg is getting my bed out of storage tomorrow. There's an air mattress. Okay, but I just thought it would be nice. I'm not drunk enough to share a bed with someone. Come on. We did it in college. I was on drugs and drunk the entire time in college. I'll give you an Ambien. That gives me nightmares. I don't want any Ambien. I just really don't like sleeping alone. Then go to Greg's. Have Greg over here. He says, I have bad boundaries, which is just absolutely ridiculous because he is a retard and doesn't know what boundaries even mean. And I agree that he's retarded. I... stop. I... only I can call him that. I only I. Let me check. Hmm, it's some girl. Who? She looks kind of Jehovah's Witnesses, Fuck that, fuck that. Get down. Get down. Down, down, down, down, down, down,. What size do you think my bed is? Like a whole... Hmm, twin XL. What the fuck is a twin XL? It's like a twin, but for a bigger children or single adults. Bigger children. Single adults like you. Okay, well, what if these single adults get horny? Well, then I guess they just do it in their twin sized bed. What kind of loser would fuck somebody in a twin bed? - No. - Oh, hey. Here you are. Greg. Hey, what's up, Noelle? Nothing. Congrats on the new pad. - Thank you. - Can't wait to see that. Yeah, you're gonna love it. Sweet. You guys gonna get a tree? Greg, what is this new obsession? What, it's beautiful. Hey, Greg, would you have sex with a girl who slept in a twin bed? Yeah, I have. Just get a new mattress, if you're so worried about your sexual viability. Hmm. Then I'd have to move it when I leave and it just... Wait, what do you mean? - Like when I move out? - Why would you move out? I don't know. People change. Things change. But we literally just moved in. Yeah, but, you know. What am I supposed to do when you move out? - Live with Greg. - What? No. But I thought we were in this together. Are you kidding me? No, I hate it when you get like this. Why... like what? Hey, hand soap honey suckle or oat blossom. I'm not so keen on honeysuckle. - Like what? - Like shrill and annoying. Just relax. Don't tell me to relax, okay? You want to live with a hostage, is that what you want, is that make you feel good? Fuck you. - Okay, I'm going to go home. - Okay. You okay? Noelle hurt my feelings. You okay, baby? No. - Hi. - Hi. I'm a broker with Arrow Realty. Did my associate tell you I would be coming by? No. Oh, well I just have some unfinished paperwork. Is now a good time? No actually... It really isn't gonna take long. Hey, excuse me. It really just, it'll really only take a minute. No, whoa, whoa. It's fine, it's... Oh my god. I'm gonna be sick. Here. It's water. Thanks. I have to tell you something. Okay. Something extremely sinister happened in this apartment, in your room. What? Do you know who Jeffrey Epstein is? The billionaire? He owned this apartment. He lived here? No, he didn't live here. This was probably some kind of orgy flop house. Maybe he housed his slaves here, I don't know. You're not a realtor. I'm sorry I lied. Why did you come here? I'm investigating Epstein's death and the high-profile rapists in his network. My work has led me here, which I believe to be one of his many properties. So you're a detective? No, I think we know the feds aren't to be trusted in this case. That's true. But you think that somebody was murdered in my bed? I don't know. Murdered, raped, sacrificed. Please don't tell anyone you saw me here. Are you in danger? You came here for a reason. I came here to get closer to the truth. Sorry Noelle's being such a bitch. Yeah. What's that cunt's problem? Right? Sorry. We've been looking for a place for weeks, and we finally find this beautiful apartment. and like usual, she can't commit to anything. Yeah well, maybe a certain tree will cheer her up, huh? I even let her have the better room. I slept on an air mattress last night, and I had the most insane dream. - Was I in it? - No. I was alone, but I felt like there was somebody there. I couldn't speak. I... My hands were tied in this like... blue and white like twine, covered in oil. What kind of oil? I don't know. It was nighttime. Everything felt so familiar. There were palm trees, someone was playing the piano. You play piano? No, Greg! Listen, it was really scary. No, no, no, I do get it, but hey... it's just a dream, all right? It's not real. Yeah, but it felt real. The island felt so remote, and I had no like, identity or autonomy. Aha! Well, it sounds like what you really need's a wake up call. Stop, it's not funny. I couldn't move. I was vibrating and I don't know, it just made me feel sick. It was like sleep paralysis. Yeah, no, that is weird. Are you listening at all? Look, I'm sorry your dream sucked, all right? Maybe lay off the Ambien. It's not the Ambien. Jeffrey Epstein's death remains mysterious. Even after reviewing the autopsy, and looking at the photos of his body and from inside the cell, that there are questions that remain unanswered. After speaking with multiple pathologists, they agreed that the cause of death is impossible to know without knowing the position of the body, the way Jeffrey Epstein's body was found. Two days after his death, FBI agents swarmed Little Saint James, Epstein's private Caribbean island, where he trafficked and sexually abused minors, locally known as "Island of Sin" or "Pedophile Island." You know one of the girls tried to swim off the island? Shark infested waters. Ghislaine Maxwell came for her on a jet ski. What would they have done with the dome? Look. No I know, there's fucking mattresses in there. Yeah, they're probably soaked in blood, too. Why would you need a private island, unless you were fucking kids? Yep. They say he played piano in there. You think? Hey, Noelle. Hey. I went ahead and got that tree. Thought it could you know, make it a little seasonal and homey in here, spice things up for the holidays. Thanks Greg, it's cute. Um, hi. Hi, sorry, we were just, doing some work. It's okay. I'm Addie. Nice to meet you. Oh, this one, this is a good one. Uh Noelle, can I talk to you for a second upstairs? I'll be there momentarily. Okay. Yeah. I'm Greg, by the way. - Hi. - Enchante. What are you working on? Research. That's the girl who came over here last night. I know. She has it on good authority that this place used to belong to Jeffrey Epstein. Okay. When's she leaving? I don't know. We're just starting to figure things out. Figure what out? Again, I don't know, just all of this. Okay, well is it fun? Do you care about Jeffrey Epstein? Do you? Very much so, yes. Isn't that the guy who murdered himself in jail? He was murdered. You can't murder yourself, someone else has to do it. Wow, really? I could've sworn I heard that it was like a suicide on the news or something. Well, it wasn't a suicide, no one thinks that. Huh, maybe he was sad. Okay well can you guys just go to a park, or a diner, or something, because I do have an audition? That's great, very excited to hear that but no, because things that are very sinister happened here. So we have to be here. You understand? - Okay. - This is the space. - Yes, fine. - I'm gonna go to Greg's but... - That's good, that's great. - When I get back, I think we should talk about house rules or... You know people can seem happy on the surface, but deep down, they're hurting inside. He had to cum three times a day. Sounds pretty sad to me. Greg, we're leaving. I'm just gonna plug this in and... No, we're Jewish, Greg. We're Jewish, can we go? Okay, good luck with that project. Nice meeting you. Bye, Noelle. See you later, alligator. Sorry about that. Who were those people? My roommate and her boyfriend. She's really hostile. Yeah, she's got a lot mental problems. - Really? - Mm-hmm. She seems so normal. No, very sick girl. Do you know about pizza gate? It was described as four penises, oval shaped, and claimed with a rack that was thick towards the bottom, but was thin and small towards the head portion. Have you seen the deposition video, where they're talking about tiny, egg-shaped cock? Disgusting. Yeah. Have you been on the Reddit? Reddit's for fucking bottom feeders, but there's a lot of really good threads. There's like this one about if it's a- Here. This is speed. No, it's not, it's Vyvanse. Then why'd you take it out of the capsule? Manufacturer recommends it. Just drink it. I just looked at so much occult imagery, the ornate red glyphs on the ground, fucking owl statues. Kamal, considered the god of ritualistic child sacrifice. Bohemian grove type shit. Bohemia Grove? You know the thing, where those rich people, they LARP, and they like worship that statue, it's like a bull sometimes. Did you know... No one talks about it. The harsh angularity of these blue and white stripes. When you contrast with concentric dome, it's pretty fucked up. And this door is a trumploy, but to a trained eye it's very poorly painted. Are you an architect or something? No. God, are these yours? - Ew! - Demented! Why does Ghislaine dress like a fucking nutcracker? Boring. Blah, blah, blah. Noelle, the collar is the symbol parts belongs to slave hood. It's an outward symbol of your- Whoever did the body... Did a fucking good job! Why do you think I circled the nose? Not. Not. I circled the notes. Not Do you think she's pretty? Who? That girl, Noelle's friend. Oh, I didn't really notice. Do you think I'm pretty? Um, I'm just like really focused. Yeah, but I'm just really... Just not right now. Okay? I really gotta focus on the game. Are you staying over tonight? Do you not want me to? No, I mean, I just wake up early for work. But I thought you were gonna help me move tomorrow? Yeah, sorry. Touch these, they feel like sandpaper. Your roommate's fucking weird. Why do you live with her, anyway? Uh, her dad used to pay for everything, and then she decided she was too good to take money from him because of some that he did to her a long time ago, I don't know. Hmm. How'd you end up here? No proof of credit, no income. It's good to be off the grid. Totally. Where do you live? Uptown. Epstein had to have known it was gonna happen when he landed at Teterboro. There's no way he didn't. God dammit, Noelle! I don't care about your kinky roommate, okay. I've been following this for years. When Epstein got arrested, I knew something wasn't right. I could feel it in my bones. Right? Who do you think killed him? The Clinton crime family, obviously. No, it was the Royals. - What, because of Andrew? - Mm-hmm. - They're irrelevant. - No, they're not. Bill Clinton flew on the Lolita express like 52 times. No, they're not, the British are so fucking cucked by the Royal family, you have no idea. They'll do anything to protect their image, even if it means hiring their intelligence service to fucking kill someone, on behalf of Andrew, so that he can continue to fuck kids. No, you're right. Queen Elizabeth is despicable. She's a batty old cunt, and I wish she would drop dead. They killed Princess Di. That's true. Noelle? The important thing is that we're awake. I wanna see the cell. I wanna see the body. The real body, not some decoy. They use our tax dollars... I don't pay taxes. Neither do I, but some people do, and their money paid for a fake body. Do you know no one in the history of MCC has ever committed suicide? Technically they still haven't. Because he was murdered! He knelt with force. - No, he didn't. - Watch. Are you okay? - Are you okay? - See, there's no way. The suicide angle's the most apocryphal bullshit. They want us dead, and they wanna fuck our kids. Celebrities, politicians. Of course, they're pedophiles. Their exploitation knows no bounds. No bounds. They're driving the world into chaos, into ruin. What's that? Um, it's just my research. Like what? Like, names, locations, flight logs. It's kind of like my black book. Can I see it? I've never shown anybody before. You don't trust me? It's not, it's not that. Then what? It's just been alone in this for so long. But all your hard work, everything's starting to come to fruition. People are really starting to listen. I've never done this with a girl before. Oh? I mean, I want to. They're going to get away with it, aren't they? They always do. Don't you get scared? Sometimes. But it's my path. Yeah. I'm not like normal people. I'm obsessed with political struggle. I admire it. I never really cared about anything. Really? I care about you, though. I know. I don't want anything bad to happen to you. You know, Epstein wanted to live forever. He knew he was going to hell. We're already in hell. Does that feel good? Yeah. Yeah, I'm so fucking tall. I could've been in the NBA. Fuck me like we're on a plane! Oh, yeah. Mile high club. No! The 727 Boeing. Okay. Say it! A big Boeing plane, I'm fucking you on a Boeing. How old am I? You're 26. Younger! Oh, sorry, 25. Much younger. Oh, yeah. You're 18. Yeah, baby, you're so... So tight. Oh, younger! Younger! Fuck me like I'm 13! What the fuck? Wait... What the fuck? Why did you stop? Addie, no, I'm not like into that age shit, or whatever. What are you talking about? That's not fucking cool, okay. That's fucked. You are fucked. Wait, what did I do? Are you with fucking me? No. Greg, I love you. Come on, let's keep going. I feel so connected. No. Please. No, you should go home. I have to go to work, and you should go home. Are you kidding me? No. Don't you wanna finish? I'll finish myself. What? Fuck! What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fucking shit? What the fuck? Fuck you, Greg, fuck! Noelle? What? What's this? Ask your fucking roommate. Royal wedding, Prince Andrew. This is our 9/11. What do you mean? I mean, it's a total paradigm shift. It's red-pilled a lot of people. Opened their eyes to the realities of pedophilic corruption. Do you feel like you're being watched? Oh yeah, you're so fucking royal. You're so fucking royal. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Hello. Hello, world. I've made it! Epstein was trying to find a particle that would make people feel like they're being watched. - Oh my god! I can feel it! - Oh, stop. I can't, I felt watched ever since we left the townhouse. No one is watching this. They are! Noelle, the particle isn't real. Epstein was a total suit, all he knew about was pussy, and he just kept those horny scientists around to feel smart! I don't wanna go back to that fucking apartment. We don't have to, we'll go to 66th. Why? There's a compound his brother owns. 61st, 66th, 71st. I don't wanna sound fucking autistic, but there's a pattern of five separating all of the properties. A pentagram. Five points on a fucking pentagram! Noelle! I found this in Addie's room. Holy shit. My parents are getting divorced, and I was looking for a protective crystal that could maybe prevent it? Rose crystals, in the back. This? Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse us? Please don't run a muck in my shop. We're not. We just have a question. What? Do you know anything about this card? We don't practice that kind of magic here. Isn't this a magic store? It's a magical apothecary. Okay, so... So, we don't dabble in the dark arts here. Neither do we. We just have a question about a card. If you're persistent in your quest, your path will reveal the deepest secrets. Some secrets, however, cannot be transmitted, through the written or the spoken word. Right. I have a question about a product. I'm not withholding this from you deliberately. It's simply a result of your ignorance and inability to grasp the concepts and reasoning required of advanced science. What exactly are your spiritual goals? I want answers. Are you looking for higher states of consciousness? Yes. When the teaching appears, the student is ready. Okay, well, we found this card... - Where? - Our house. Move out. Why? You found that card loose in your house? Yeah, and we found this one in our roommate's bedroom. You're in grave danger. Can you just tell us a little bit more about... Absolutely not! You should leave your house as soon as possible. But more importantly, you should leave my shop immediately. I'm sorry to say, that your roommate is doomed. There still might be time for you. Doomed? Leave! I'm going to give you an obsidian crystal for protection. But you must leave, right away. You don't understand! You can't stay here! Addie? The apartment is cursed, we can't stay here. We discovered, the townhouse, the compound, and this property are all separated by five blocks, Addie! Five blocks! Five points on a pentagram. That sounds scary. What? Addie, are you okay? Why are are you wearing that? What the fuck is wrong with you? Don't you get it? This place is cursed. Oh, it's not so bad. Once you get used to it. Well, I'm not getting used to it. I'm getting the fuck out of here. Addie, what's going on? Are you okay? Greg and I got into a fight. About what? I don't really know. You don't seem well. Hey, did I have any mail? No. I'm not a conspiracy theorist. The only conspiracy, is the one between the elites, who depend on a permanent underclass for them to exploit. She had the Prince Andrew spoon, the one that was in my pocket. What is wrong with her? I don't know! I told you she's a very sick girl. And she's always been like into the UK. Into the UK? Anglophilia is one thing, but pedophilia? It's demented, even by her standards. This place has bad vibes, man. I feel fucking cursed just being here. What kind of fucking cunt bootlicker is even into the Royals? - The Royal family. - Jesus Christ! what happened in there? We'll never know. The cameras malfunctioned. That's what they want you to think. I'm scared. Me too. If they get to him in there? They can do anything! I think maybe we're starting to get too close to the truth. Oh my god. Is that your roommate? Why is she dressed like that? Is she fucking following us? Is there someone we can call? Someone in her family? No, her mom's on some goddamn Klonopin, she doesn't know left from right. - What about her dad? - He's a pedophile! Jesus Christ. Should we call Greg? - Who's Greg? - Her boyfriend. I thought that guy was gay. He is. Oh my God. It's Ghislaine, Ghislaine Maxwell. What are you guys doing here? What's going on with Addie? I don't know, you're the ones who live with her. Don't be cheeky, you fucking cock! Noelle, I told you not to call me a cock anymore. - Have you seen her lately? - No. She said you guys got in a fight. It wasn't really a fight. Well, what happened? I don't know, I don't really want to get into it. It was weird. Spill it, faggot. Normal, pathetic Addie weird, or like satanic? I wouldn't know if something was satanic. Just get to the point. I'm not a fucking satanist. What happened? All right. We were having sex, and she started saying that we were on a plane. What kind of plane? A Boeing. And look, we don't normally like talk when we're fucking, we're pretty vanilla. And then she told me to fuck her like she was 13. And so I freaked out. I didn't mean to yell, but I'm not into like, pedophile role play shit. I didn't mean to scare her, but she was pretending like she didn't even know what the fuck I was talking about. I don't know, maybe she was like embarrassed or... Greg! I said no more girlfriend at work. We're customers, we're buying a fucking box! You're not customer, you're not customer, bye. Go play, go to Peewee Herman's Playhouse and play with the other children, bye. - Please, just go. - Sorry, I'm very sorry, sir. I'm very sorry. So the ton of sword symbolizes betrayal, painful ends, crisis, loss, wounds. Betrayal? - Painful ends. - Right. I think your roommate is a victim of CIA mind control. Have you heard of MK Ultra? Most of the files are destroyed by the government, obviously, but she's exhibiting all the symptoms. She's completely depersonalized. It's obviously gotten to her. What are you getting at? She's not like us, Noelle. She's a liability. What do you mean? I mean, we have to get rid of her. Get rid of her? She's weak psychologically, that's why they targeted her! You wanna kill my roommate? Sort of how you targeted me! What? How do I know that you've been gotten to you? - You know me, Noelle. - No, I don't! You know that I was trying to... Trying what? Trying to warn me? - All I wanted was the truth. - Uh-huh. That's all I ever wanted. And you were willing to do whatever it takes. Of course. You don't care if people get hurt. You don't care what happens to anyone, not even yourself! I'm selflessly focused, but I would never hurt you. I don't even know your name! You're just some fucking meth head who showed up on my doorstep, and decided to rip my life apart! I was trying to warn you about the apartment. I didn't want to be involved. I didn't have a choice. Stay the fuck away from me! Noelle? Noelle! It's done. How you feel? Young. Good. It's good. Noel? Your... your roommate, your roommate tried to kill me! She tried to kill me! Noelle? Noelle? Are you okay? Noelle, are you okay? Do you think my tits are too big? Maybe, but I like that. You're crazy! You're crazy. What are you doing after work? I dunno, what are you doing after work? I dunno, what are you doing after work? I dunno, maybe I kick it, we could play some video games. Do you like games? Greg! What the fuck? You you have to come with me right now! Why? Goddamn it, Greg, come with me right now! I can't leave, I'm at work. Why the fuck are you covered in blood? Your girlfriend is fucking dead! - What! - Wait, you have a girlfriend? Help me! Is this a prank? I tried to tell them, I tried to tell them! Noelle knew! Noelle knew! Noelle! Greg! Okay. Now, Greg, you fucking faggot! Okay! No. No, no, no, no, no. Noelle was here! - Where? - Here! And she was bleeding! - You know... - I hit her with a crystal! I'm probably gonna lose my job over this, okay. So I hope you have a good laugh at my fucking expense. No! No! Is Addie even here? Or are you and Noelle just being cunts? Is she even here? - The basement! - What basement? What are you talking about? What basement, you don't have a fucking basement. Cool, yeah. No, no, no, Greg. You have to believe me, they were down here. I saw her body! Yeah. Please! No. No! You know, I'm so sick of you girls. I don't even know who you are! Greg! No, no, you're just so retarded, fucking, spoiled bitch! Greg... No! Grow up, okay? Grow the fuck up, and get... and get some fucking help. Get some fucking mental help, okay? Jesus fucking Christ.
