See the woman? Houston, we have a problem up here. It's half past the hour... and now time for the news with Michael St. James. What do you make of it? I don't know, Joe. No weapons, no motive, no clothes. All we've got to go on is this bloody corpse. - Well, look again, Harry. - Huh? Not blood... Due in a large part to a major surplus of tomatoes. Tomato juice. The tomato crop continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Within the last 12 hours, we have received... a number of unconfirmed reports from throughout the nation... that may or may not be connected to this strange phenomenon. Sure doesn't taste like tomato juice. Look at the giant tomato, Martha. I didn't knew they grew 'em so big, Jess. I wonder where he's going. He got little Timmy. Poor Timmy. He ate him all up. The tomatoes are coming! Sheriff, they're coming! My god, did you see that? A tomato... You didn't see anything. You didn't hear anything. - The pilot's still in there. - Forget about the pilot. - Come over here! - We can't leave him. It's just too incredible! A kamikaze tomato! - Tomatoes can't fly! - Yeah? They can't eat people either, but they're doing one heck of an impression. Jim, talk to that sheriff and find out what's going on. Get over here! How bad is it? Well, sir, I definitely don't think it'll fly again. I'm not talking about that, you Weiner! What about the tomatoes. We found two more bodies at the main road... but we pushed the tomatoes back to the north end. I don't think any managed to bust loose. They better not have. I want this thing contained! I understand, but nothing seems to stop them. We tried chemicals, bugs, bullets. Nothing seems to work. Look, the President wants a complete investigation. We can't let this out. People would... Panic, that's what. And you know whose ass is on the line? Yours, mine, and the entire AG department. Look out! What if the President wants an investigation? He'll get his investigation, but we'll keep it quiet. I've arranged for the most obscure generals... the most obscure scientists, and to head the investigation... this man. - I don't recognize him. - Nobody does. His name is Mason Dixon. He hasn't worked since the bay of pigs. - Is there any sign of a problem elsewhere? - Not yet. I've ordered the entire G.D.♪. program shut down. Wait a minute. Isn't that Jim Richardson, the Press Secretary? What's he doing here? The President's got him keeping an eye on the investigation. - Why him? - He's got a vegetable garden, that's why. With peas and carrots and squash and tomatoes. That sheriff tells me... there were reports of incidents like this all over the county. Oh, bullshit. One nut spots a flying saucer, and pretty soon... everybody's shaking hands with little green men. God, who would've thought. All we wanted was a bigger, healthier tomato. Look out! Here it comes again! Where did you get this one, general? Oh, I won that one in a three-legged sack race... last armed forces day picnic. What's the matter with general number two? Oh, he was out all night on manoeuvrers. Let him rest. Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, gentlemen. Would you follow me, please? Certainly. Oh, general, would you wake up, please? I apologize for the size of this room, gentlemen. It's all I could do on such short notice. Now, are we all here? Where's Jim Richardson? - The Press Secretary? - Yes. Perhaps we can give him a few more minutes. General, I've been meaning to ask you... have you heard anything about the nuclear strike force... tactical training command meeting? - You mean operation nichefict? - That's right. Not really. I've been following the personnel proficiency planning... for Pago-Pago paratroop platoon patrols. Oh, operation ppppp. - What's the poop on ppppp? - Moving well. Did somebody mention misfits? - No. Ppppp. - Ah. Well, then, nichefict must be pretty well wrapped up. Gentlemen, gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Now that we're all here... I'd like to turn the meeting over to Dr. Morrison. - Doctor? - Thank you, captain. - Major. - Pardon me? Never mind. Well, as I'm sure you're well aware... this tomato problem has caused considerable concern... within the scientific community. Scientists throughout the nation have... directed their attention to this... very vexing problem... with only limited success. However... with the help of Dr. Fuji Nokitofa... we believe we've made a breakthrough. Gentlemen, may I present Dr. Nokitofa. How do you do, doctor? Very well, thank you. Dr. Nokitofa, would you please explain... the project to the gentlemen? Gentlemen, what we have developed is, in essence... a half-man, half-robot... a very sophisticated combination... of human intelligence and superhuman powers... which we are confident will result in the ultimate... destruction of the enemy. Thank you, Dr. Nokitofa. Are there any comments, gentlemen? Mr. Black? As head of the federal intelligence agency... I certainly don't mean to question the background... of these fine gentlemen... but frankly, I don't think the answer to this problem... lies in trinkets and gadgets. This is man versus vegetable. Technically, sir, tomatoes are fags. He means fruits. Ah. Fruits. You see what I mean? Mr. Dixon, I've been authorized to assign you four of my best agents. Gentlemen, with your permission, I'd like to... introduce Mr. Dixon to his operatives. That's fine, Mr. Platt. In the meantime, the rest of us will accompany the doctors... down to view a demonstration of the latest anti-tomato project. We'll be going outside, Mr. Dixon. You'd better bring your coat. There's a little jap in the air. He means nip. ♪ Wash, wash, wash. ♪ ♪ Scrub, scrub, scrub. ♪ ♪ Can you get my back? ♪ Oh, my eyes! Oh, my eyes! Water! Water! Actually, gentlemen, this project entails... the development of limbs with superhuman powers. Unfortunately... budget limitations have restricted our development to only... one of these technologically advanced legs. Okay, Bruce, now let's try running first. Uh, that'll be fine, Bruce. Bruce... please jump for us. Despite some minor recruitment difficulties... caused by our recent ♪.R. Problem... I believe you'll find that your unit... will meet the highest of standards. Pynchon. Your men, Dixon. Sam Smith, disguise expert. Gretta Attenbaum, swimming expert. Gretta defected to us after the last Olympics. We feel she's gonna be quite an addition to the department. Greg Colburn, underwater expert. The fourth member of your unit, It. Finletter... is winding up his current mission. He'll contact you at these coordinates. Expect him at 10-100 hours. Good luck, Dixon. Can you, like, believe how he waffles on every issue? Oh, right on. We'll never have another president as bad as this one. What is it? Over there! No! No! Mr. Daniels, I realize that in the past... there have been some questions raised... regarding the president's use of public funds... for what some may consider personal items. However, I can say without fear of contradiction... that under no circumstances and at no time... has the current administration expended... any public monies whatsoever... for the purchase of the fluffy flower-print toilet paper. Now, if there are no further questions... Thank you, Mr. Press Secretary. Mr. Secretary! Mr. Secretary! Just a moment, gentlemen. One more question. The little fellow in the rear. Bobby Jenks, sir, ♪.S. 149. I have a question, sir. Certainly, young man. What would you like to know? We've heard nothing at all about the growing tomato menace. I... Uh... Wouldn't exactly call it a menace, young man. There have been some isolated reports... alleged incidents involving some unusual activity... associated with this, uh... particular vegetable... but I assure you that, uh... this is not and never will become a menace. However, the President, leaving no stone unturned, has... called upon our most noted congressional leaders in this field... to begin a thorough, intensive, painstaking... and exhaustive investigation... into the backgrounds and origins of this... interesting quirk of nature. Furthermore, you can assure all of your young readers that... this will never become a problem that Americans need fear. This, uh, meeting of the senate investigating committee's... called to order. Anybody remember what we're supposed to be investigating? - The tomatoes, Wayne. - What was it? We're investigating those tomatoes. Oh, yes, yes. Yes, of course. Yes. Well, there's one for you... one for you... one here for me... one for you. There's supposed to be one for everybody. Wonder where it could be. Good morning, city herald. May I help you? Roberts! - Sir? - Get me Goldstein. - He's still in Beirut, sir. - Beirut? Yes, he's fired, sir. Oh. Yeah. Get me Johnson. Sorry, sir. He's covering that trial in Texas. Oh, cripes! Okay, just get me anybody in the special assignment desk. They're all on special assignment. Goddamn it! Who the hell is here? Well, uh, there's you, sir. Thank you, Julius. Wait a minute. - There's Fairchild. - Who the hell is he? She. Sir. Lois Fairchild, society section. The new kid? Society, huh? Oh, what the hell. Send her in. Now, damn it! Hey, look. It's a funky little tomato. - Where are we going? - Take the old mission road. Some crazy-ass biker has got himself munched on by a herd of tomatoes. - So what can we do? - We can keep it quiet, that's what. Didn't you hear the police radio? It's solid tomatoes between here and Holtville. We're liable to get killed! Will you can it, you little pud-puller? If John Q. Public finds out what's really going down... we're both as good as dead. Fairchild, sir. - Hmm? - Fairchild. You sent for me? Oh. Yeah, yeah. Have a seat. Fairchild, I've been keeping my eye on you. You've got a good sense of organization. Thank you, sir. Fluid style. - Thank you, sir. - Sharp mind. Thank you, sir. - A nice ass. - Thank... I'm about to give you a challenge... your first big assignment... and I expect you to use... every attribute at your disposal. I'm sure that what you lack in experience... you'll more than make up for in... Determination. Now... this will give you the necessary background... to handle the assignment. Go to it. Right away, sir. Uh, one more thing, Fairchild: I'm certain the government will go to unbelievable lengths... to ensure the secrecy of this thing. Good luck. Help! Help! Do you read me? Do you read me? Go away! Go away! - Do you read me? Do you read me? - Are you happy now? You kept it so goddamned secret, nobody knows where the hell we are! - Do you read? Do you read? - Help me! S.O.S.! Give me that, for Christ sake! You can't tell me to shut up! I quit! What? You can't quit! The department... Screw the department! I'm gonna die! You conceited little S.O.B., I'm gonna die too! Good! Good! Good, good, good... Not good, Mr. President. Not good at all. Frankly, I was not overly impressed... with the level of competency displayed by the scientific team. I haven't seen Dixon's special forces unit yet... but if it's anything like what I've seen so far... I'd say we're in for a bit of trouble. I know what you mean, Jim. I know what you mean. It's like trying to stack bibles... on whipped cream. - Yes, sir. - Jim, an unusual problem... calls for an ingenious solution. I think I've got one. Jim, have you ever heard of mind maker? Certainly, sir. The advertising agency you used in your campaign. That's right. You know, they said I'd never get re-elected... especially after it got out that I used the Statue of Liberty... as collateral on that Arab loan. - Yes, sir. - But... I'm sitting here now... and I owe it all to mind maker. Incidentally, Jim... you were in the Middle East last summer. Tell me, how does the old girl look in the Dead Sea? - Just grand, sir. - Good. I tell you, Jim, if those fellows could elect me... - They can do anything. - Yes, sir. Jim, I want you to fly to New York immediately. I want you to see Ted Swann. Believe me, the man's a genius. I'm on my way, sir. Yes, Sir. That's the whole story. Say, would you want to buy a used crib? I don't think so, but I appreciate this information. This could be especially helpful in... Fairchild, from the times. What's this deal about tomatoes? Look, buddy, don't try and stonewall me. - Hi there, Lois. - Oh. Hi, Clark. - What are you doing here? - Uh, no comment. And who's he? No comment. How serious is this situation? No comment. - The American public has a right to know. - Up, up, and away! You can't ignore the press. Dixon! Dixon! Dixon! Dixon! Hey, guys, here's the song everybody's been asking for: Ronny Desmond's puberty love. ♪ Puberty, puberty love ♪ Oh, wow, what is that? Oh, no! Don't tell me that's the song. Please, oh! Turn it off! Oh, it's torture on the ears! I can't stand that noise! Quiet! I want to hear the news. And today, the president closed the nation's... last remaining sub base at Groton, Connecticut. When asked why he had made the startling decision... the President responded: Those funny little black ships just keep sinking anyway. And in other news today, in Newark, New Jersey, a man was eaten by a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich. You're free! Geronimo! Hmm. So you're Finletter, huh? I'm Mason Dixon, and this is... My god! It's Adolf Hitler! This is Sam Smith. He's our undercover expert. He's only disguised as Adolf Hitler. Guten morgen, herr Hitler. - Autobahn. - Sprechen ze deutche? Weiner schnitzel. Get in the back seat! What about me, Mr. Dixon? What about me? You... You... You go disguise yourself as a tomato... and infiltrate their camp. Yes. Thank you. - Hi. - Mr. Richardson to see Mr. Swann. Yes, sir. He's expecting you. I'll let him know you're here. Please have a seat. Mr. Swann? Mr. Richardson is here to see you. He'll be right with you. Jimbo, buddy! How are ya? How you doing? - Fine. I, uh... - Super, super. Hey, the president tells me you have a situation, Jimbo. Well, let me clue you: You boys have come to the right place. Let me give you a peek at mind maker in action. First, we have to convince the little housewife out there... that the tomato which ate the family pet... is not dangerous, no problem. Then we have to convince local authorities... that the thousands missing from rural communities... were merely stranded during their... bicentennial pilgrimage to Philadelphia. No problem. Third, the president wants us to do this in such a way... that it can be covered up, and no one will know it ever happened. That's no problem. But then he wants us to do this... and convince 200 million Americans... that this disaster is actually a blessing. Now, that's a challenge. I understand what you're saying, Mr. Swann. The president is a very demanding person. Sometimes he expects the impossible. But I don't... I never said impossible, Richardson. What I said was that it was a challenge. Man was put on this earth to meet challenges, my boy. You really think you can do it? Can I do it?

You got that? No matter what happens, you tell her. - Yes, sir. - We interrupt this program... to bring you a special bulletin. The following is an NBS hotline bulletin... with Douglas Keikler in New York.

What are the blue dots? Those are Mobil stations. Oh. That must be major mills. - Take over. - Yes, sir! I'm glad you could make it, sir. I think we've got something that will interest you. So I've been told. Dixon, I want you to see this. Captain? Yes, sir. Sir... we've captured a giant tomato. I'm afraid, gentlemen, that what we have here before us... isn't what we thought. You don't mean... This... may god help us... is a cherry tomato. Mr. Dixon has ordered me to inform you... that there's tomato activity in your sector. All right, who wants to be paper monitor?

Well, we have spent a great deal of time and effort... and over a million dollars to create a symbol which will wage this battle... an effort that will become known as... the stop tomato program. I see. It all looks quite... Extraordinary. Thank you. Now if you'll excuse me, I think I'll be on my way. Just a moment. One more thing... before you leave, Mr. Secretary. I'd really like you to see this. It's something I've worked on for many years... the culmination of years of effort: The world's ultimate commercial. Roll it. Hi. Jesus Christ for Technitron. The nation is in chaos. Can nothing stop this tomato onslaught? Last night, tomatoes attacked Los Angeles... Boston. Seattle. Chicago. Even the mere mention of the word... is sufficient to induce panic. Tomato. More news at the hour. Now back to the rocking sound of the boober on super 101. All right! Man, that's really something, huh? Hey, everybody, I'm gonna play something... That's right, man. It's number one in the charts this week...

This is a question best left to people... for whom there is no spokesman greater... than those who speak... And then I put my foot to the floor... and I got out of there as fast as I could. It was all very strange. I... I just don't know what to think. You made no unusual motions of any kind? Not to my knowledge. Odd. Were there any loud noises or other extraneous activity... which might have affected the tomatoes' behavior, such as... an airplane or another car in the vicinity? I'm almost sure there wasn't. If you'll excuse me, gentlemen... I really have to be getting back to Washington. That's fine. Give my regards to the president. - I'll do that, captain. - It's major. Of course. Priority-one message for Mr. Dixon, sir. - A phone call for you. - Oh, thank you. I'll need one of those for my records too. I'll need one for my files. And don't forget the major. - Yeah? - Trouble, sir. - Hello? - Trouble, sir. What? I haven't seen Dixon all day. I've been following his assistant, but that's getting me nowhere. - Followed?

We'll need every man we can get. Damn it, Dixon, this is war! Very good, sir. Sir, I... I think somebody's shooting at you. Where do you think... So you can see, Mr. Dixon... we have no choice but to make our stand out west. And I want you to make sure... that our military people out there... in that region understand and are aware... of their enormous responsibility. I'm sure they are, Mr. President. By the way, have you seen Jim Richardson out there? Just briefly. How's the ad campaign going? Excellent. My mail's running... 30 to 1 in favour of the tomatoes. Terrific. Oh, God, I almost forgot. - Shirley? - Yes, sir? I want you to get general Mitchell on the line. Tell him to bomb New York City.

Had a pleasant nap? Richardson. I'm not surprised. Mr. Dixon... I didn't really think you would be. That's why you're here. What do you intend to do with me? Mr. Dixon, don't be so naive. You are the only one with the knowledge that can stop me. Don't be a fool, Richardson. You don't have a chance. You know very well I do. You know... It's funny, Dixon. No man sits closer to power... than the Press Secretary to the President of the United States. And yet as close as it is... that power is never really within your grasp. It dangles before you... taunting, daring... mocking your very impotence. I will not be mocked anymore! I will no longer give... other people's answers to other people's questions. The answers will be mine. The questions will be mine. Everything will be mine. It'll be glorious, Dixon. It's too bad you won't be around to see it. What makes you think that you can... control these tomatoes better than anyone else? Questions, questions. You missed your calling. Mr. Dixon, have you had lunch yet? Here. Have a tomato. Don't be afraid. It's really quite small and quite harmless. It's from my garden. You might say that I'm... In tune with my tomatoes. At the proper time... when all vestiges of authority have disappeared... I shall charge in on my white stallion... and save the nation... or what's left of it. My fellow citizens will be eternally grateful. At the very least, they'll surely choose... my benevolent leadership... over the obvious alternative. It shall be my Golden moment. But, Mr. Dixon... I'm afraid these are your final moments. You're awfully confident for a man who has failed twice. Three times, but who's counting? I don't think you can do it. You know, Dixon, you may be right. I've never killed a man before. You may be right. Who's there? U.♪.S. package for you. Come in. Then again... - you may be wrong. - Wait. Before you pull that trigger... tell me how you do it. Really. How melodramatic. Very well. It's really quite simple. You see, all I do is... A real bad apple, sir. It's a good thing we got him. Finletter! Finletter! We've got to round up everybody in the city. You got that? And meet me in the stadium. There's no time to lose. But, sir, everybody's left town. The only people left will be crazy people. I don't care! Just do it! Move! Sir... Then it's unanimously agreed... that the committee recommend... that no further action will be taken at this time. I've got it! I've got it! Hey, guys, look! They're starting to come! They're coming! Turn on the record player! Cover your ears! Everyone! ♪ Puberty, puberty love ♪ ♪ There's nothing like puberty love ♪ ♪ It's so great, it's so cool ♪ Look! The tomatoes! It's working, it's working! Charge! I want to thank you for saving my life. Just doing my job, lady. Well, I guess there's nothing more to say. Bye, Mr. Dixon. Goodbye, miss Fairchild. Lois. Lois. Goodbye, Mr. Dixon. Mason. Mason? Lois? Oh, Mason! - Lois! - Mason! - Lois! - Mason! - Lois! - Lois!
