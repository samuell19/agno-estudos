Who wants more? I... Ariel. This must be your father. Can I go? Of course. Thanks for the help. You're welcome. Less religion, more farm and family. At least for the next few months. In case you remember us. Our sister is busy with university. Eh? Leave me here. My best shot would be... In case your body will not bear it... You must... Will you stop the pickup? Please. And stop talking nonsense about my body. Watch how you talk to me! Will you come for dinner or what? Perhaps. Good afternoon Dora. How are you? I am fine. Do you know where Omar is? He has gone to a retreat for a few days. Why didn't he tell me? Why should he? Does he need your permission? We had a scheduled conversation. Very important. Men of Hard Skin It will probably be necessary to rent a tractor again. Ours consumes more and more fuel. If this is your only problem. No kid. We have thousands of problems here. And all at once. Cold mornings will be a problem... Rings are worn out, in case you don't know. Of course I don't know. You are for that. You know so much... Of course I know. That's what I said. Yeah. But you meant something else. As if you could fool me. How can I ever fool you? No way! Don't pull my leg kid. But I just said... Enough! I'm tired of dealing with losers. Are you talking about me? Ariel! For you. Say at least:'Thank you.' Thank you Betina! Hello. who's there? Hello, Ariel? Sorry. This young man insists on speaking to you. I'll take care, thank you. Who gave you this address? I don't understand you my love. Instead of explaining to me why, you just disappear. I'm trying to solve a crisis. What's wrong? The thing is that when we are not together, I don't know where and with whom you are. This annoys me. Why don't you let me know? I'm going through a conflict with my vow. Which part you don't understand? I can't believe you just care for some moments of sex... You are so wrong about this. You keep saying, I just care about fucking. And you know you're the only man whom I was with. Here you go again, honey. You are selfish, obsessive. You are suffocating me! Can we go to your room for a while? Ariel. I think it will be better if you start to see other people. I can't give you nothing else. As much as I want to. Don't do this to me again! I'm feeling sick seeing us both like this. Don't ever look for me again. That's an order! The thrill of the first years. Excuse me? This is not just some kind of shelter. And I feel that you and I have a common topic. I feel like a bag of old bones. Where every joint hurts because of uric acid. The only one that works better than in my youth is my memory. What an irony! Why the irony? Because our memory bothers us, my friend. And those young eyes... that fascinated us so much, and made us dream, look nowadays from depths, waiting for an explanation. What explanation could I give? The conflict in me is a lot different from the one Ariel feels. Ariel? Yes. The young man who came visiting me. I had to be persistent to overcome his shyness. And look at him now. For 30 years, I was in charge a parish. And because of something that happened to a boy a long time ago, I'm now an outcast. Are you being prosecuted? No. The statute of limitations has expired. But it came recently to light. I understand. If he could work the way he cries, we would be rich. What are you trying to do, monkey? Just one brother who pays a little attention to me. Any ideas? These days I'm not receptive. Who taught you that phrase? Someone I met once. And I guess we won't talk about that someone, right? Correct. Then what to talk about? We can talk about my noisy sister. You're a lost case, dude. This boy lost his way. Drugs. Crime. That's the life he choose. But that's unpredictable and was his choice. It was as unpredictable as the fact, that he recently committed suicide and left a letter to his family, in which he reported in detail what had happened between us. That's where my torment started. His relatives circulated my photo all over town, next to the word 'rapist'. What did you do? I tried to talk to them, but they despise me. I know at some point, they will attack me. Anyway you can stay here with some relative. The rest of my family is in Italy and I am no longer in touch with them. Besides. I'm too old to play hide and seek. I have no desire, nor the strength to do so. I'll go back to my parish. I'll give you my phone number and address. In case you need something, feel free to call me. What's left for us if we can't be supportive to each other, right? Excuse me. Where can I find the student Gallarza? Galarza is gone father. Didn't you know? Thanks. You know that I provide special spiritual support of student Louis Gallarza? Do you know that the tragedy affected his parents. Well. And? I want to know what happened to him. Why isn't it coming anymore? Gallarza does not visit this school anymore. His grandma asked for a transfer. Omar... We both know the price of pursueing our vow. Abstinence and faith. These are basically our tools. Work on detachments. Listen to me. What are you talking about? Work on detachment. For the good of us all. You know what I mean. Why? It was not me. My grandmother became suspicious and decided we had to move. Where? Really far away. In another province I suppose. She doesn't tell me. Try to contact me, as soon as possible. Write me. I can't promise you anything, but I will try. Let's go, Lewis. If we both decide... Think about it. Bye. Think about it. My dear neighbors. The topic we are going to discuss is associated with a very modern dilemma. And which one way or another affects us equally. I'm talking about distraction and its consequences. Nowadys our senses are bombarded by many incentives: The sea of ​​strident music for example. Fear of street violence. Meaning the damage that a stranger can suddenly cause to us. Or the constant consumerism, in all its forms. Hi Hey. How are you boss? If anyone is the boss, it's my father. Who could guess that you are so fit? You look so thin, wearing clothes. I don't want to get into trouble with your family or anyone. I did not say anything about getting in trouble. Want to see what I got? Caress him. Come on. Finish what I started. Don't worry about the boys. They are already gone. Listen, Sole. I thought about it thoroughly, and I came to a decision. Which is? No. If you don't care about Julio, I do. It is important that our baby be baptized. Don't be selfish. Who says it's important? Everybody does. It won't hurt her. I don't want to wait until she gets sick, to run to the church with her. My daughter is not suffering from anything. You're the one talking about diseases. You bring the disease to the house. Didn't you say you love her? What do you think? Do you doubt now? Of course not love. I respect yours beliefs, but I want you to respect mine too. Don't go to the ceremony if you don't want to. And who will you go with? Who wants to accompany you? My sisters. You don't even have to know. I don't want you to tell me anything, nor give money to these fucking priests! We go to a church where they don't take money for baptism or wedding. Got it? If we paint the rooms in the warehouse, we can use them as bedrooms. It is better for workers to stay here during the week. They won't waste time traveling, and there is plenty of room. What makes you think, that they want exactly that? I spoke to them and most of them agree. If someone doesn't want to, he can travel. We could consider it Dad. It won't be expensive. If that suits them and will produce more... If we do, I can take care of that. Better late than never. Long time no see. Good to see you. You're right, Pablo. It's been a while. How are you? How are things going in the church? Okay. I'm a little worried about Ariel's absence in the soup kitchen. Didn't he tell you? Ariel doesn't want to talk to me or anyone here. He doesn't care about the school either, neither for the farm. He is immersed in his things. Only now he somehow started to do some things for workers. The worst part is that from time to time he is depressed. He doesn't even let us talk to him. Maybe you could... I can not promise. Ariel is a very sweet boy, but it depends on the way you treat him. I'm sure there is no malice in him. I can try. Well. I'll leave the two of you alone. What a surprise! How are you? I'm fine. Why don't you come to church and in the soup kitchen? I've been there a couple of Sundays. I didn't see you. I tried not to be seen. Memories... They hurt me. This is my choice right now. I think you went wrong. I've never talked about hatred. What do you mean? I tried to explain to you, that you are suffocating me. And jeopardizing my position. For example. Your attempt to have sex in a retreat place was crazy. Really? And what are you trying to say? Don't make me go through this... No! I do not want to! How so? You forget your words quickly, but I did what you said. I'm with someone. You didn't waste your time. And why should I? His name is Julio. How nice. Does he take care of you? Of course he cares. It's that boy over there. I hope at least he bathes. He does. I will not deny my feelings for you, but I'm no longer alone. Give my respect to your father and your sister. I hope you and the boy will be happy. We will be happy, don't worry! I have not seen you in a while. Did you forget those who always supported you? Complications. And you? And it's complicated for me. But what hurts me the most is to see friends, who do not support each other. It breaks my heart. What do you want? I want to visit a good friend, about 300 km from here. I want you and two guys. Party? Sure. Minors or legal age? I want one of them to be someone named Julio, who works at Ledesma's farm. I know him. I don't know if he wants to participate. This kid has a family, you know. And the other one? You choose him. Find someone sexy. Like this one for example. Really juicy. Walter. I don't want them to know what am I do for living. Of course. What can I offer them? Food, good pay, about 4000 each. But if Julio doesn't come, the whole thing is canceled. Okay. I got it. Don't you wanna see how it looks so far? Now you probably can stay overnight. No way. Why not? Can you tell me? I have a wife. And I live only 5 km from here. It would stupid to tell her, that I will sleep here instead of going home. Why didn't you tell me you were married? It's my life. How is that of your concern? I guess not. You should have told me, you were settling these bedrooms. Why? The boys felt that you do it for me. Now I am constantly harrassed. Did you tell them? There was no need. Do you think they're stupid? Come on, who will dare? There you are! Are you coming, Julio? I don't know what you mean. If your friends are like you, old man... Don't talk about me like that, jerk! Don't be mad. Get it! Will there be money? Money has never been a problem for this guy. But remember not to say he's a crow because he will kill me. Come on Julio. Are you coming or not? No fucking way! Julio. If there's cash, we blow the back of his neck all the way. What is your problem? How much? 3000. Just to let them blow you a bit in a small town, 300 km. away. We will leave on Saturday and come back on Sunday. Everything has been paid off. Tell your bitch that you go fishing. What about me? Hold your horses, bitch. This is not your race. Have you seen yourself in a mirror, dwarf? I may be a dwarf, but look what business I have arranged. We'll see if you live up to it. This is something you will not understand. Are you trying to skip me? Hey. You are very touchy today. You're skipping me. Who the hell are you? Leave the boy alone. He is a friend. Look at me when I talk to you. I really don't understand the reason for your trip. What? Do you want me to take you? And what do I care if you understand it or not? Who do you think you are? If I ask for permission, I could come. That's enough nonsense! After my wife agreed, you have nothing to say. I wonder about your intentions on this trip... and your company. Are you serious? Fucking asshole! Do what you want! Apparently it is the story of my life. Are you thirsty kids? A little drink will be fine. Do you like wine? Not so much. I'm a beerdrinker. Of course. Because cold beer, makes life worth living. Yes. Sure! What is so funny? Are you laughing at me? What do you do for a living? I slaughter animals. Interesting. A little rough. I mean your work. It is seasonal for me. I don't do it all the time. I understand. What about you? I meet people, like with you now. I'm having fun too. I say live and let live. I enjoy and let others enjoy. That's all. Can I order another beer. No need to ask, honey. Hi there, pretty people! How was the trip? I'm Federico and my house is yours. Welcome! Omar... How are you? Look at this! My God! Nice place. I like it. Come on, Julio. I'll show you our bedroom in case that you want to take a shower. I could really useone, but there is only one shower. Go, kid. Listen to your little Omar. You go. I don't need it. I don't like this guy. He is disgusting, a true pervert. Let them just blow our dicks and go downtown. It's not a big deal. What if we go now? So? We can go if that's want you want. Let's go. Okay. Hey, stop the nonsense. Let's go into the house. Why the hesitation? I don't like dour ones, Omar! I don't like dour ones! We go downtown and will come back later. What are you doing? I will also go to keep an eye on them. Wait, wait! Everything is fine. Don't take too long, sweeties. There's lamb for dinner. I chose it specially. Where are they going? We said we stay here, dude! The kid wants none of this. Come on, Julio. Don't ruin the party. Bye. Thanks. Give me a bag of super strong gum, cutie. You're not from here, are you? We are visiting an uncle who is ill. Are you leaving soon? It depends. If there is a reason to stay... What is your name? Julio. We are sisters. She's Lucia, and I'm Beatrice. Nice names, nice girls. What are you going to do tonight? Will you just look after the uncle? What do you suggest? Fast chick! You can't fool her. Who are you honking? Kill me if I am not useful for you! Just because you have a car... What are you doing here, Walter? You are embarrassing us in front of all these people. Go with your mama, moron! Come here Walter. Will you do me a favor? I just need 15 minutes. Go, kid. Go. Are you sure it's okay there? Sure it's okay for my friend as long as we don't stain it. We'll go to the back. I called it first! I'm leaving. Whoever is not in the car stays here. I don't give a fuck. Wait! wait! Don't make such a fuss. Tell him to stop. I'm pissing my pants. I need some soda to put out the fire. What do you think, Omar? Nothing. Don't tell me a word. Come on, darling. Let me pee and then you can blow me. What are you talking, pervert? Who do you call a pervert, cheap faggot? Stop your fucking car or I'll beat the crap out of you! Stop right now! Come here, asshole! Who do you think you are? What the fuck makes you think you can lead us to fuck your faggot buddy? Did you think we would play house with that fucking fag? And on top of it all, you pretend to be offended, asshole! Don't you have anything to say? Leave me alone. Listen to the kid or you are done. From now on you will do what we say! You will spend money on us, and if you play the fool, I'll bind you to a tree and shove a stick into your ass! Clear? Is that clear, faggot? Yes. Julio. See if you can arrange the seeds that just arrived. Can you? Of course. I'll stay. Be careful with him. Everything is fine. I warned you. I'm done, boss. Really? That's great. Touch my son again and I'll chop you. Filthy bastard. You won't step on my farm or any nearby area. I'll take care of it! I'll be back in 15 minutes. If you're still here, I swear, I'll cut your balls off. Did not Julio come today? Ask your dad! What happened with Julio? What do you mean with 'what happened'? Yes. Where is he? I fired him. He's a thief. He's lucky I didn't sent him to jail. Fucking dirty shit! What's happening to you, little brother? Come on, talk to me. It's hard for me to live. That's what happens. You may think I'm dumb, you and everyone else. You don't have to justify your sexuality to me. No matter which path you choose, you will always be my little brother. Did you know? Of course. And more than you think. I've got my stuff too, like everyone. With young people? With a couple of older guys too. But I know how to take care of myself. And it's always been as far as possible from here. Otherwise dad would kill me. You just need to keep in mind that everything is temporary. Everything. And you don't have to do anything to please others. Don't betray yourself. That never works. You've never had a better timing. Boss. The animal did not make his nest before, because there was no need for food. Do you think so? Of course. The moment it felt hungry, it got desperate. Ariel! Come with me. What for? Come and you will see. Hi Pablo. Hello. How are you? Fine. Where are the girls? There is no one today. No one? Really? No. I am the youngest today. The two of you together or separately? No, it's just him. Take care of him. I don't want to! Shall we? Come on, sweety... Let's do the hanky panky. Mommy begs you. Do not touch me! Hey! Do you always play hard to get? I told you not to touch me! What the fuck are you here for, asshole? Hi Ariel! How are you? How could I know that the chicks would not be here? Say something. What's wrong with you? It was dad! Why are you crying? What did he do to you? He took me to the whores. He's crazy. How could you do this to him? Careful with that tone. I'm your father. If you like these places. Go. But don't take the kid! The kid has big balls, it's time to start using them! He doesn't have to go if he doesn't like it. and he can get crap. I take full responsibility, damn it! Your mother abandoned you. Not me! You two are part of me and I'm part of you. Whether you like it or not. Enough of the talk! Fucking shit! What happened to you? You shouldn't be here. I can't talk to you right now. Relax. Since when did we stop understanding each other? Go Ariel! No. What is your problem with me? What's up, Julio? What does this one want? This one has a name, dear. I don't care. You have to. Trust me. Enough. She is my wife. You don't talk to her that way. Who do you think you are? I'll come again. I promise. What was that about? It's not of your business. Get inside. It is not my affair, you pervert? I can't thank you enough for coming. Can I call you my friend? Of course. I'm surprised you're still living in this village. As I told you, I feel old and tired of hiding. How are you, Mrs Matilda? Mind your own business, fucking pervert! I think you shouldn't put up with this. These are odd reactions. What I'm getting usually is indifference. Shopkeepers for example refuse to sell to me. I would prefer that everyone who hates me come and hit me. It would hurt less than all this contempt. I can talk about hosting you at the school where I work. No, my friend. Thank you very much. Have you ever been abused? No. I 'm not. I was. And I've lived all my life with this trauma inside me. The only moment I could forget... Sometimes I think that those who abused the little boy I was, were also victims to the same thing. And so the damage perpetuates through the centuries... Now, whatever shall happens it will happen. Don't you ever feel remorse? I'm going through a period of deep instability... There is probably something like that. If you ever hear that I killed myself, let me tell you two things. The first one is, don't believe it. And the second one? Let things as they are. If it's not suicide, it's murder. And it will be fair. I don't think anyone will dare to kill you, for something that happened so long ago. Would you be so kind to hear my confession? Of course, Father. What's up daddy? Hi mom. How are you? I came for the kid today. Is she here? You like the kid, don't you? Can I have her? Zulma! Go with Pablo. Take care of her, you moron! Of course. Follow me. Son! You've got company. Who is she? A neighbor who wants to get to know you. I don't feel like it. What do you want? Do you have anything to eat? It's good. Why did you want to see me? Your dad paid me 200 pesos to fuck with you. He said you'll be shy at first, and I should not refuse you anything. How could you agree? I do it all the time! I'm the biggest whore ever! For 200 pesos? And just with the mouth it's muss less. Almost nothing. I don't like you. Not just you. Any girl. That's not a problem. I can tell your dad you fullfilled and that's it, pal. Will you do that? I can pay you too. As you wish. Can I tell your dad you asked me to come again? Do you have some more? Hello. Hello. Why did you come back, Christian? What happened to the family you were with? They leave the country and cannot take me. They said that when I grow up I can visit them. What a pity. Will you come with me? If you talk, you will go to hell! I will not give you communion. Do you understand? Let me go! You never told me you were father of a child. True. But I never promised you something. I'm not saying that. But considering what we have shared, you could talk to me, instead of disappearing. The problem is... ...I like you. And don't make me tell you. Let's see each other from time to time. I can't end this. I don't want to! Being alone is terrible. Let's see each other from time to time. But only if you are seeing someone else. Why are you saying that? These are my conditions. And who do you want me to see? Some friends are meeting here. Hi Julio. What's up? I'm fine and you? Normal. And who is this? He's brand new. He just needs guidance. I'll go buy some beer. Wait for me here. And what about you? What about me? Hey. Calm down. We're all really close here. Son! We need to get fertilizer from the village. You're coming? Can I drive? Of course... It's about time, right? Get some guys. Okay. No problem. Hi Ariel. Where is your dad? In the farm. Can you give me a moment. I'm with a client. Then you can load your stuff. Of course. No problem. I have to run an errand. Here is the key, so you can start loading. Of course boss. I was wondering if you would come back. It wasn't easy. I thought a lot about it. Cut the crap! Relax. I'll take care of you. Look who's here! Where were you? I have been busy. You can't imagine, Zulma. He is such a sweet boy He is studying for pharmacist. So you only see him there? Of course. No one goes to that house looking for the love of his life. How many have you been with? No way! Take care dude. I don't want you to decompose, fag. Look who's saying it. Cheap whore! I guess I'm just lucky. If you continue to be a good boy, I have one cousin for you. He is a real macho. Is he a good man? He is a real macho. Kneel and kiss him. No, thanks. Excuse me, pal? I don't want it with you. I always come here for them to blow me. Bunch of fags. Besides. You are Ledesma's son. Your father does not know what you're into. Leave the kid alone, lech! What did you call me? Lech! Good afternoon. Hi Ariel. Hello. So it does not make you sick anymore? You misunderstood me again. It was your harassment which made me sick. You did not let me breathe. You said we both made you sick. I remember well. If you expect an apology, you won't get it. I don't understand you. What are you looking for now? One last time together. We both owe ourselves a farewell. I am no longer the kid you knew. And I trusted you more than anyone else. But everything is different now. Did you forget what we had? Somehow I still love you. But I'd rather be dead, than to be with you again. What do you mean, that you're not the same? What is your cousin like? So you're serious, huh? He also wants to meet you. But my cousin has a problem. Aids? No. I don't think so. He shits by the side. Disgusting. I do not know... Some time ago they stabbed him. And now he is ashamed to be with a woman with the shit hanging and the sounds from his guts. With a whore too? My cousin won't touch a prostitute, if you put a gun to his head. He'd be a fool. Why wasting time with a woman, right? That's the faggot talking. Dismount. Sorry for being late. She didn't know I can't get to that place. What is your name? My name is Ramirez. And why can't you get here? You're curious, huh? Rustlers' dispute. Get on the horse. Who are you to open the fridge? Bye kid. How's that this kid does whatever she wants? Does it bother you? You are asking me? This kid comes because it's necessary. It's is the only way I found, to keep your brother from having sex with men. Is that clear? This went on for more than four years. But at some point, the relationship or the lack of it affected me in the same way. I felt an existential vacuum in my life That makes it very difficult to fulfill my vocation. Omar... We have all faced contigencies in our youth. And we know that an extreme situation like this one. tends to be as depressing as inappropiate to our role. Repent and forget this young man. We both know that what you did with him is very negative. But he wasn't the only one... Find refuge in the faith. Don't think abandoning the doctrine is the solution. But you have to fight that urge today. I can grant you a transfer far, very far. Perhaps that's the best option. I absolve you. Come on. Don't be afraid. Is the barbecue ready? So you're Don Pablo's son? Yes, it's me. Give him my regards and deep respect. Of course. So, this is it. Is it okay for your family? Why? Everyone lives his life bro. Have you ever been with a male? No. If I do something you don't like, tell me! Relax. You don't have to be shy with me. Come on, get off. What are you doing, douche? Get off. See you soon. I'll leave you. Let me know when you're done. Please keep in touch. And remember you have a friend here. I know Ledesma. Don't worry. I just came to say goodbye. Yes. I heard the news. They offered me a transfer and I accepted. I think that's best. I never imagined... What? This... That the last time we met, would be like this. That I would care so little. I care and it's affecting me. That's why I leave. I'm just warning you, so don't play the fool. Who saw him? What is the difference? Until to a couple of weeks ago, he was sucking dicks where the fags gather. He's scum! No idea what he told you, but he did not tell you that. Did you know that, jerk? Of course she did. And now she is playing dumb. Fucking cunt! You are the one to talk, bitch Hi. Hi my ass! So the girl plays dirty? What are you doing, beast! You're leave in your dreams, fucking fag. Let me go! I'll show you. So before me, you were every guy's girl? What are you talking about? Who told you that? Is it true? Lie to me and I'll beat the crap out of you. It's my life and I did not know you. What if I didn't find out? Everyone would have make fun of me. I didn't tell you because I thought that you didn't care. So... you care. Are you okay dad? You have one week. Excuse me? You have a week to find a place. But... What's up now? What did I do wrong? Your sister is 24 and never knew what a boyfriend is. And you... Look at you! And on top of that, you're parading with my men before my eyes. You're just missing to bring them in your bedroom. It's not against you, dad... But what I feel is very strong. Exactly... Go. Leave me. Do you love him? He loves me. It had to happen one day. Won't he talk to me? He'll get over it. Ariel. Always remember that nothing matters to me. Except that you're the best brother I could ever have asked for.
