It's like a croissant with injeolmi. [all] Ah! You guys don't like injeolmi? It tastes really good. [giggles] [Rosé] Says the Thai girl in the car. [laughs] [Jennie] Every time a new album comes, we're just excited. We're like, "Ah, yay. Finally, one more," you know? I think we're halfway there, maybe? We're always halfway there. We're like, "We have the songs… there. We just need to record them." [Jisoo in Korean] Seeing so many people love our music motivates us to try something new and different. [in English] It's time for us to do some music. Yeah. [Jennie] We just have so much to show people. I don't think we've done something really girly yet. We've practiced and explored so many different things, um, during our trainee days, and so it's just a matter of how much of that we could end up showing as BLACKPINK. I think, for me, when I say girly, I want to do more like… like… [softly] "Hello…" -[all giggle] -[Rosé] Like what? Like, ooh… [laughing] [bass and drums playing] [in Korean] Why is that delay so strong right now? Can you bring it down a bit? Push it forward a bit. [in English] I'm their producer, songwriter. I've written and produced every single song that's come out so far. It's been about four years now. Our initial approach was more like… single, smash, single, hit. Now, we feel like we need to tell more of our personal story. And I know the fans are mad. Like, "We want more and more." We do have a lot in here, but… we're very particular with what we put out. [knocks] [Rosé and Jennie in Korean] Hello! [all giggling] [Jennie in English] Oppa, you got some leather jackets going on there? [in Korean] Awesome! [in English] Stop acting like I overdressed today. I always dress like this. [girls giggling] [in Korean] I should've had a nap today. -I'll slap your wrist. Sleepy right? -I didn't get a nap. Ah! [groans in pain] Better? [Teddy in English] So, I have the… Lady Gaga featuring BLACKPINK that's about to come out. Oh! ♪ Sour candy ♪ -[exclaims] -[Jennie] So sweet!

["Crazy Over You" playing over speakers] [Teddy in English] Every group has their own different cultural background that makes them who they are. [song continues] [Teddy] But the combination, that's what makes BLACKPINK unique and stand out. [in Korean] Who thinks they can nail their part in this song? [in English] Rosé, want to go in first for the intro? [Rosé sings in Korean] [sings in English] ♪ Can't get you outta my head ♪ [clears throat] ♪ My head… ♪ [Teddy] Rosé, a Korean girl that was raised in Australia. And she stays here 'til, like, six o'clock a.m. just in the studio. Sometimes I'm like, "Wow! You still here?" [Rosé] ♪ Can't get you outta my head ♪ [sings line in Korean] [in English] Ooh… you really killed that one. [vocalizes] [Teddy] Jisoo. Straight-up Korean girl that grew up in Korea. She's the unnie of the group. She's the oldest. [Jisoo sings] ♪ I'm ready for love I'm ready for love ♪ [Teddy] She does have that professional poker face. I've known Jisoo for, let's say, a good six years. I've seen her cry… once. She's super smart. A lot of people might think she's book smart, but I would say she's street smart. ♪ I'm ready for love, I'm ready for love ♪ -[rattling] -[in Korean] Oh, that scared me. [Teddy in English] Lisa, from Thailand. She's always got that cool, calm, "it's gonna be okay, we're all good" smile. ♪ I'm ready for love I'm ready for love… ♪ [Teddy] But when it comes to certain moments, when the music starts, when it's crunch time, she has this executioner killer instinct. [singing in Korean] [Teddy in English] Jennie, born in Korea, but moved to New Zealand. She's super clear. Her opinions, her emotions. She's a perfectionist. [song continues over speakers] [Teddy] All those different cultures in one pot, it's just different how they walk, how they talk, and how they dress. And the perfect balance, how they complement each other. It's fascinating. [song continues over speakers] [Teddy] We're just Korean people trying to do music, so if Korean people make music, it's K-pop? I don't even get it. Like… It's Korean pop. The only thing is language. Why don't they do that for every country? What is K-pop? -[static] -K-pop. [reporter 1] K-pop is taking the US by storm. K-pop has become a worldwide cultural phenomenon. The genre has been around for at least two decades. [in Korean] This is a three-member group named Seo Taiji and Boys. Please welcome them. [crowd clapping] [upbeat music playing] [rapping in Korean] ["Boombayah" playing] [reporter 2 in Korean] Powerful rhythm and flash dances are the hallmarks of Seo Taiji's music. They sing well, look cool, and dance well. ["Boombayah" continues] The interest in Korean pop music is unusually high from foreigners. [reporter 3 in English] A few big music agencies began making these polished groups of singers, rappers, and dancers. [reporter 4] One of the heavy-weight companies is YG Entertainment. [reporter 5] …responsible for the insanely viral "Gangnam Style." [sings in Korean] [reporter 5 in English] The industry brings in billions of dollars a year. [reporter 6] Grooming these singers is an industry all in itself. [reporter 7] Trainees can start as young as 11 years old. [reporter 8] They're raised together. They train together. [reporter 9] Perfecting every pitch. Mastering every move. [reporter 7] Stakes are high. Some make their debut after just a few months' training. For others, it could be up to a decade. Many never make it to debut at all. [both howling] [Jisoo in Korean] How many do I have to pick? [chuckles] [Jennie in English] Preparing for a new album, that's definitely fun, 'cause it's like trying to come up with something new, but fittings like this, it is one of the biggest, like, creative parts that we do. -[Lisa exclaims] -[Rosé] Oh, Jisoo! -Wow… -[Lisa] Oh là là. [Jennie in Korean] You look naturally sexy! -Really! -You can't help yourself! [Rosé] If we wear something, we all try to see how it fits as a group, but that's-- Well, it's case by case. [in English] It takes a long time. [in Korean] Shouldn't we make it a bit tighter? What do you think? -Because this side goes up. -[woman] Mm-mm-mm. [in English] Okay. [Rosé] Lalisa. Oh là là! [Jennie] Lisa! Lalisa! [Rosé] Oh là là. [Jennie in Korean] Lisa has diverse tastes. -[in English] She can wear whatever. -She pulls off anything. [Rosé] It's so hard to define style. I don't think there's any, like, boundaries within that. We don't go, "This is Korean, and this is Western. This is Asian." I think fashion is really just international. The more that there aren't any boundaries, I think that's when you can get creative. And since we do crazy choreography on stage, it all has to be really engineered, basically. Make sure nothing flops out anywhere. -[Rosé] Yeah. -[laughs] ["Boombayah" playing] -[in Korean] What's this? -Coachella. [Jennie] I missed my note at the "eh." See, this is why we can't watch our old footage. We're like, "You missed your note at the 'eh'," and, "I should've gone slower at this part of the choreography, but I did it too quickly." I missed my note. That wasn't good. [song continues] We were so nervous… [in English] Yeah. If anything, it's stressful. Sometimes if something's not working, or I'm not doing my best performance, it can be stressful. [Jisoo in Korean] Compared to other stages, it was much more overwhelming because we were so nervous. [Jennie] For us, it was our first time in a country we weren't familiar with. I used to dream of that day when we were trainees. [in English] This is what we wanted. -[sighs] -This is it. -This is it. [all giggle] I always avoid interviews or any questions about me because I would rather not talk about myself, but… ["Solo" by Jennie playing] ♪ Used to be your girl Now I'm used to being the GOAT ♪ ♪ You're sittin' on your feelings I'm sittin' on my throne ♪ ♪ I ain't got no time For the troubles in your eyes ♪ ♪ This time I'm only lookin' at Me, myself, and I ♪ ♪ I'm going solo ♪ [music fades] [woman in Korean] Jennie's personality? At first, it was hard getting to know her, but once we became close, I could tell that she's very loyal, very sweet, and a lovely friend. [both chuckling] I see her every day, so I'm used to her, and she's like my little sister. But when I see her on TV, I'm like, "Ah, Jennie is a star,” but she's really down-to-earth. -[Jennie breathes deeply] -[Jessie] You're doing so well. [Jennie in English] She's my friend. One of few that I have. [laughs] -[groans] -[in Korean] Slowly. [chuckles] We're going to lift one leg up and do an arabesque. [in English] I'm always aching after tours and stuff. I feel like, out of all the members, I'm always sick. [laughs] [groans in pain] You know, some days, just like every other human being, you feel extra happy. And some other days, you're feeling down. Singing, dancing, and rapping, I always enjoy it all the time, but we always have to be on stage looking perfect and performing the same thing. It's like working out for two hours every day. It never gets easy. Gets harder, actually, 'cause you age. [laughs] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [chuckles] I was born in Korea. It's just me and my mom. I'm the only child. I was raised in Seoul until I was ten. I went to Australia and New Zealand to travel with my mom, and by the time we got to New Zealand, it was so nice and peaceful. She asked me, "How do you feel about living here?" And I said, "Yeah, I would like that." So, from ten to 15, I was in New Zealand by myself. I never really got to spend so much time in the house with my mom… until recently. [children singing] [Jennie] I did a homestay. I got to just run around, learn so many things. [young Jennie in Korean] I understand English better than when I began. In the beginning, my friends helped me a lot and showed me their notes. Now I can do it by myself. [Jennie in English] They have classes in school to go out, go camping, go learn instruments. If you want, do art. Everything was up to you. Even if you're ten, you still got to make your own decisions. That was very important for me to have at a young age. That built me as who I am right now. I am super shy. I was one of those people where I can't even order something on the phone. Like, I hated that. -[giggles] -[in Korean] Good work. [Jennie in English] Took me a while to get this far. -Ta-da! -[chuckles] [Jennie] When I turned 15, I was deciding whether I should move to America. I went there, I checked the school out. Everything was kind of decided, like 80%. And I came back to New Zealand to pack my stuff up, and that's when I realized I don't want to go to America and do another study there by myself. I actually want to become a singer. I don't know where it came from. ["Wait A Minute" by Pussycat Dolls playing] [Jennie] As soon as I came back, I did an audition. And luckily, I got in right away. I was like, "Wow! These people are so in to it!" "They know what they're doing." I was like, "Let's catch up." That's all I had in mind. ♪ I only call you When it's half past five ♪ ♪ The only time that I can call you… ♪ [Lisa in Korean] So pretty! ♪ …love it when you touch me ♪ ♪ Now feel me When I'm fucked up, that's the real me ♪ ♪ When I'm fucked up, That's the real me, babe… ♪ [Jennie in Korean] Oh, that’s really long ago. I used to do a lot of dark and strong songs. So I often wonder, "What am I doing right now?" It's so different from what I do now. [chuckles] -[rapping in English] -[Lisa in Korean] Wow! -[Lisa] Your gestures! -[Rosé] You're always so cool. [Jisoo giggling] [Jennie in English] It's sad to say, the very first group of people that trained with me, none of them are here with me right now. And as soon as Lisa came in, that's when I thought… [in Korean] "Wow, there are people born to do this." [chuckles] ["As If It's Your Last" playing] ♪ Uh, I'ma fall in love, baby ♪ ♪ You gon' finna catch me ♪ ♪ Uh, give you all of this, baby ♪ ♪ Call me pretty and nasty ♪ ♪ 'Cause we gonna get it My love you can bet it on ♪ ♪ Black, we gon' double The stack on them, whoa! ♪ [music stops] [Lisa in Korean] My role… I'm a rapper and also the lead dancer. Hello. [gasps] [in English] Oh, this is cute. [in Korean] I love vintage clothes. So wherever I go, whether it be America or anywhere else, I try to look for vintage shops. [in English] Oh, wow. Voilà! [in Korean] This is  1.1 million. -And this is  320,000. -And this one? That's 750,000. This is  1.1 million? Yes, because it's from the early '90s. Oh! [in English] This is so cool! Can I-- Can I get this? [chuckles] [in Korean] My mom manages my finances. [in English] She's gonna be like, "No, Lisa, no. Stop shopping for now." She's always like that, but I don't really listen to her. I'm sorry, Mom. [giggles] Whoa! 1997. When I was born. [chuckles] [Lisa in Korean] I was born in Thailand. [in Thai] I was born in Buriram Province. Then I moved to Bangkok when I was three. My auntie had a music group, so they had mic stands, and I always played with them. I would lower it until it was the same height as me. Then I would just dance and sing to myself. That was how my mom knew I loved dancing. So she signed me up for a course when I was in kindergarten. -[dance music playing] -[woman] This is behind the scenes. [Lisa] That was how it all began. [singing pop song in Thai] [Lisa] She signed me up to many contests… [in English] …dance competition and stuff. [in Thai] How long have you been practicing break dancing? For a long time. [Lisa] I participated in a contest. I was around 12 or 13 years old then. Then a talent scout told me to try singing and asked if I wanted to be a singer. Then I realized that I loved both singing and dancing. And YG happened to have an audition at the time. So, I made a decision. [in English] Okay. I should try, for sure. [screams] [Jisoo laughs] [Jennie in Korean] Is this an audition? [Jisoo] How many layers are you wearing? Why are you wearing pants on top too? -What is this? -[Rosé] Oh, wow! -Oh, my God. -[Rosé] This is amazing. Wow! You look so cool. [Lisa] I'm trying so hard to be cool. [in Thai] After the audition ended… [in Korean] …I waited for the call. I was waiting and waiting. [in Thai] I waited for the call. I waited for two months! And then they called me. I was like, "What? Is this possible?" [screaming, laughing] [Lisa in Thai] I was a mama's girl. So, when I had to go to Korea without Mom, I felt that I had to take care of myself now. [in English] I was 14. Such a kid. [in Korean] I didn't speak any Korean. I only knew how to say "hello," so it really was a new start.

Do you teach makeup like this too? -[Myungsun] To regular people? Yes. -Really? -There are classes for that? -Of course! I should've taken those classes then. [chuckles] There are people who come to learn BLACKPINK makeup. -BLACKPINK makeup? -Yes. [Jisoo] When I was younger, my relatives treated me like an outcast because I was ugly. What? [Jisoo] They called me a monkey. It's okay. You're the prettiest one now. [Jisoo] I grew up in Sanbon in Gunpo city, Gyeonggi-do region. I lived with my parents, my sister, my brother, and my grandparents. I'm living a very different life than the one I thought I'd be living. I used to want to be a writer or a painter. Although, I couldn't paint well. And then I joined the drama club in 11th grade. Should I try acting? They were saying I should start auditioning for stuff because I needed the experience. [piano playing] [Jisoo] My first audition was at YG. I didn't know much at all about YG before I arrived there the first day. It felt like something far removed from me. I never thought I'd actually be doing it for real. How about now? Do you think I really lost my baby fat? Back then, it was more baby-like here… I guess I'll just have to eat ramen before I sleep tonight. [chuckles] Maybe then you'll get your old self back. No, you're perfect right now. Anyways, you were like a baby back then. But you're different from back then, too. -[laughs] -You have your own shop! Who told you to open your own shop? Say it! Who told you to? You did. It was my big plan. And I'm still planning big things. I think that there are very few who truly think, "This is what I have to do. This is my path." People like that are really lucky. I don't think there are many like that. [sings in Korean] [Rosé in English] I have a really hard time falling asleep. [singing in Korean] I have a lot of thoughts running through my head. [continues singing] And singing is kind of like stress relief, and everything just kind of makes sense when I'm doing this. [continues singing in Korean] [in English] That's a really hard song. [laughs] [exclaims] I didn't think I could ever perfect that one. [laughs] [sighs] [groans] Sometimes, I actually have missed my trainee days. [playing chords] Because, back then, we were surrounded by music all the time. But these days we've got a lot of work, so I actually have to make time for this. That's why it's always at night, when I'm supposed to be sleeping. Hi, girls and boys. I'm called Roseanne… and I just woke up. And welcome to Pajama News. [Rosé] I was born in New Zealand. And then I moved to Australia when I was eight. [playing slow melody] Back then, I was always on the piano. I'd like sit there, and I'd play this lullaby for myself, but I'd be really sleepy, and I'd fall asleep, and then I'd put my chin on my knee. I went to church every Sunday and had a lot of Korean friends there. But then at school, I was just a normal Australian kid. -[man] Congratulations, Rosé. -[audience clapping] [Rosé] And I think I enjoyed having two lives. Kind of like Hannah Montana. [laughs] It's funny. ♪ If you look me in the eyes ♪ ♪ And catch a glimpse of heaven… ♪ [Rosé] My dad saw on the news that YG was coming to Australia. He was like, "Rosé, do you wanna audition?" And I was so shocked. I think I asked him, "Do I like music? Do I?" And he's like, "Yeah, obviously." "You're gonna have to, you know, try do something about it."

I dropped out of school. In Australia, I dropped out of school. I had never even imagined myself living apart from my family. I hadn't even slept more than two weeks out of home. It was a really-- Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna cry. [voice breaking] It was-- I'm gonna cry. Yeah. The first night in the dorm, they were all in the same room. Everybody was sleeping. [in Korean] She brought a guitar from Australia, and I was like, "Play something for us." [laughs] [in English] It was us four. I don't even know why, but it was us four. We covered songs 'til morning. All four of us, we were singing. Somebody was harmonizing. I think Jisoo was harmonizing. It was so funny. Can you believe it? -[Rosé laughs] -My eyes. [Rosé] My eyes. -[in Korean] It's really pretty. -[Lisa] Wow! Here, stand here. [in English] One, two… [shutter clicks] [exclaims] -Nice. -I wanna have a look. [Lisa in Korean] After my Korean classes on the fifth floor, I took the elevators to the basement. And there was this girl with short hair, tied back. It was kind of awkward. -I was nervous. -I'm sure you were nervous. [in English] So weird. [in Korean] I was like, "Oh! A new girl?" -[Rosé laughs] -I was like… so wary of competition. -[in Korean] Right. Competition. -Competition, it's so competitive. [in English] Everything was gyeongjaeng at that time. She thought I was competition, and I was just really intimidated. Like, everybody is so good. [Lisa in Thai] We were the same age, and we had similar tastes. [in Korean] Since we both came from another country, we relied on each other when we were having a hard time. [in Thai] We become like two peas in a pod. We were like genuine twins. [Rosé in English] We have so many days where we walk out, and we're wearing the same thing. [in Korean] And during our days off, we'd always be together. [in English] She started getting an Australian accent. [Lisa laughs] See, she still has it sometimes. [in Australian accent] No. -Yeah. -No. [giggles] I don't even know how to say-- I never knew I would live in Korea. Then all of a sudden at 16, I'm like… Now Korea is my home. [Lisa in Korean] Was it hard for you? [in English] Of course. Even though you have me? You? You're not any help. I'm joking. [giggles] -Yeah, 'cause I grew up with a sister. -Mm. Think about not having a sister. But Lisa was there. [in Korean] When I was having a hard time, I'd look at Rosé, and she'd be the same. [in English] I thought I was really sad, but I'd look at you, and I'd go, "Okay." [both laughing] I think what makes K-pop K-pop is the time that we spend as a trainee. We all live together, sort of like a boarding school, like a training version. [Rosé] I think there were nine girls. They were planning on creating a big group, so they had a lot of girls there. [Jennie] They need you to be at their standard in every single subject. [in Korean] For me, there were so many lessons in the beginning. I took three to four dancing lessons a day and practiced. I had vocal lessons from two to three teachers. It was a rough time. [Rosé in English] We'd get a day off every fortnight, and then practice again for another 13 days. So 14 hours a day just training. [chuckles] ♪ Look at y'all lookin' ass hittas Stop lookin' at my ass, ass hittas… ♪ [Teddy] It's not easy, the repetition. But at such a young age, they are able to absorb all the techniques and the tools that they need for their next ten years. [Rosé] There's this basic routine you have to learn in dancing. Jennie was like, "The first thing you have to learn is that, and I'll just teach you the first moves." And she was like, "Do this." And I was like, "I don't know how." [Lisa] I can still remember the first day that you had a dance lesson. -[laughs] -'Cause I'd never danced in my life. It was cute. If you ask a 16-year-old to dance for the first time, it's the funniest thing. I looked like a… [Lisa laughs] And then after that, I got so angry at myself. I was like, "I am going to become like Lisa." 'Cause Lisa was the dancer. She was like… She was at the top. [dance music playing] [Rosé] At the end of every month, our boss and all the producers would come, and we'd perform a solo song, a group song, and a group choreography. [Lisa in Korean] For that, we'd have to plan everything ourselves, but we each had a role. If someone was in charge of vocals, we'd give them that role, but I always took on the role of the dancer. So I'd always design the choreography. Every month! Literally every month for five years. [audience clapping] [Lisa] After a monthly review, you would be graded. You had those who got an A, those with Bs and those with Cs. [Jennie in English] I remember having to send a good friend of mine home every month because they got eliminated from the test. There were so many rules, so many things to just be like, "Okay, they don't like this. They don't like that." Everything that I did was wrong. [Jennie] Being told that I'm not good at stuff face-to-face and trying to keep everything together when I hear those things… It's really harsh. It wasn't a very happy vibe. We're not allowed to drink, or smoke, or get a tattoo. [in Korean] I rarely went home and had to practice on the weekends. So my parents were quite upset and worried. But they're not really… the protective, overbearing type, and they knew this was something that I had to do, so they told me to stay strong and get it done. [in English] I would always call my mom… [laughs] …and I would always call her and tell her, "Mom, it's so hard." She'd say, "Come home." I'd say, "No." My dad sent me, and he was like, "Rosé, come home." He's like, "We want you back home." And I hated that. I hated it whenever they would say, "Come home." That was the last thing I wanted to hear. ♪ High dive into frozen waves ♪ ♪ Where the past comes back to life… ♪ [Jisoo in Korean] I started a bit later than the others, so I was able to make memories with friends and go to school.

[Lisa in Korean] Waiting was the hardest part. [in Thai] I didn't think I would make it. I was on the verge of letting it go. [in English] It was just days on end with just a bunch of girls not knowing where this was going. [in Korean] I'd ask myself, "Do you want to give up because it's not easy?" [Jennie in English] I knew I could do it. The tougher they treated me, I'm like, "I'm gonna get through it, and I'm gonna show them that I'm worth it." ♪ I should be more cynical And tell myself it's not okay… ♪ [Rosé] After all of this, I'm not gonna go back without doing anything. That would be embarrassing for me. That's what I thought. ♪ 'Cause your eyes, nose, lips Every look and every breath… ♪ [Lisa in Thai] I had to keep fighting. I had to give it my all. "I don't care how long the training will take." "Bring it on! I don't care about that anymore!" [crowd clapping] [Jennie in English] So, the CEO would put us into different groups every other month just to see. And there was a point where he pointed the four of us out. ["Boombayah" playing] [Jisoo in Korean] We were evaluated together, and the four of us did screen tests and recorded demos together. ["Lean On" by Major Lazer playing] [Lisa] It happened naturally. We just clicked. [in English] ♪ Do you recall not long ago ♪ ♪ We would walk on the sidewalk… ♪ [Jennie] We just got along so well. Because usually there's like, "Oh, I wanna sing more." Or, "Oh, I wanna be in the middle." There's always those little fights going on in the groups. But when it was the four of us, it was clear what we were doing. And that's what made it possible for us to be in a group. You know, four girls being in one group is not easy. ♪ …fire a gun All we need is someone to lean on… ♪ [Jisoo in Korean] When you're working in a group, everyone has their place and a role. And when everyone settles into their roles, that's how synergy is born. That realization changed my outlook. When everyone is where they need to be, big things can happen. [in English] ♪ Blow a kiss, fire a gun All we need is somebody to lean on ♪ [crowd clapping] [upbeat electronic music playing] [Teddy] When I first came in the picture, there were seven, eight, nine girls. Then we started cutting some songs, and sonically, whatever that sounded the best. The four girls right now, the combination. And of course you start looking at their individuality, like their character. The four of them just felt right. [song continues playing] [Lisa in Korean] Teddy felt like a CEO to us. If somebody did something with Teddy or met with Teddy… [gasps] …it was considered to be a big deal. [rapping in Korean] [Lisa] I didn't know much about him. I knew he was a 1TYM member. [Teddy in English] It's a different time, and I just wanted to become someone that I needed when I was young. I didn't have somebody that's a little more outside looking in, telling me where to go. [in Korean] The first time we met was when-- [Jisoo] When I was a trainee. [in English] I was so nervous. I couldn't really talk to him. [Jisoo in Korean] Meeting you was like the final stage of the debut. You were the final boss. If we meet you, we get to debut. [Lisa] You're right. Oppa, do you remember… how we had to record that whistling sound 1,000 times? [all laugh] -[in English] That I'll never forget. -[girls laughing] I cannot forget that. And we almost didn't come out with "Whistle" for our debut song, but-- [Teddy] Too many people thought it was risky. But last minute, we were like, "It has to be that one." [Teddy] 'Cause it has this weird country vibe to it, and it's super minimal. It just sounded too empty for a lot of people. Most people were against it. We just pushed forward, whatever. Hey, you know that photo there? That's our very first photo session as BLACKPINK. [Jennie] Yeah. It's oppa's favorite photo. As soon as I saw that photo, how it turned out, I was like, "Oh, this is gonna be fun." ["Boombayah" playing] [reporter 1 in Korean] YG Entertainment is expected to showcase its first new girl group in seven years since 2NE1 debuted. [reporter 2] Under the direction of producer Teddy, this new group is being prepared. Its members and debut songs have been shrouded in secrecy. I'm shaking! -So shaky! -[staff laughing] "Various… diverse colors…" [sighs] How does it go? [in English] All I wanted was people to see the potential in us. It didn't necessarily have to be, "Wow! This group came out, and they're so perfect in every single way." Like, I wanted people to be curious about us. [in Korean] Hello everyone. I'm BLACKPINK's Rosé. Hello everyone. I'm BLACKPINK's Jennie. Hello everyone. I'm BLACKPINK's Jisoo. Hello everyone. I'm BLACKPINK's Lisa. Uh… after training with my members all this time and finally being able to debut on this stage, I'm nervous and excited. In the future, we will work hard to show everyone BLACKPINK's unique colors. Please love us! [all together] Thank you! [in English] As soon as we debuted… [in Korean] …I think it happened just the way I thought it would. [Jisoo whistling] -I look intense. -[staff laughs] [in English] Let's go! [all together in Korean] Hello. I can't wait. Can you tell us who's performing next? Two of their songs debuted exclusively at Inkigayo last week and could be number one! [man] Shall we see the performance of BLACKPINK, the hottest rookies right now? -Music… -…start! ["Whistle" playing] ♪ Make 'em whistle like a missile Bomb, bomb ♪ ♪ Every time I show up, blow up, uh… ♪ [reporter 3 in Korean] YG's new girl group, BLACKPINK, has reached number one only 14 days after their debut, which is the shortest time ever by a girl group to reach number one. [Jisoo] I remember making our debut and winning awards. [staff clapping and cheering] [in English] Wow! [in Korean] And feeling like, "Wow! We did it." [cheering continues] [Jisoo] "Whistle" kept going up and up, and when it hit number one, we were just so happy and excited. ["Whistle" continues] [Jennie] Honestly, I think I was most surprised when "Whistle" reached number one on the music charts. That was the most exciting. [in English] I remember we were… [in Korean] …in a practice room when we heard the news that we were number two. I kept on checking and checking, but we had to go to practice. We'd check every hour. And then someone came in and said, "Oh, my God!" [in English] We jumped up and down. [in Korean] I remember my friends telling me that they heard it. They were like, "I'm outside, and they're playing your song!" It felt really weird back then. I was like, "Oh, my God, that's so cool! Shoot a video! Send me the video!" [singing in Korean] [in English] Lisa! I love you! [fan 1] I just really like their style. Their sound is super different from other K-pop groups. [fan 2] It's 'cause they have so many foreign members, and it really shows how anyone can achieve their dreams. [fan 3] They own the stage when they're on it. [in Korean] Their dance is so powerful. [in Dutch] When their music is played, you just instantly start dancing. [in English] They have the strongest friendship I've seen in a K-pop group. [in Spanish] You can see they love what they are doing and are born to do it. [in English] I felt like this is a girl group that I can actually vibe with. [singing in Korean] [music stops] [in English] You know, they cool. They the baddest bitches alive. [laughs] ["Whistle" continues] [crowd clamoring] [Lisa in Thai] When I was a trainee, nobody knew about me. But after I debuted as BLACKPINK, everyone would follow me no matter where I went. I didn't know that we would become this famous. [music stops] [Rosé in English] How much did you sleep last night? [in Korean] Three hours. -[in English] Three hours? -Yup. -[staff 1 in Korean] Clear in front. -[staff 2] Everybody get out. [Rosé in English] During trainee days, I was desperate. I really wanted it. But after debut, that's when you start getting a lot of responsibilities. [man in Korean] Everybody look into the camera. [Jisoo] Then came the pressure for our next thing. "What now? What do we do?" "Let's come up with something fresh." I felt like we were being chased. [director in English] Action! ["Playing With Fire" playing] [shutters clicking] [in Korean] The winner is BLACKPINK! [crowd screaming] [song continues] [moans] Thank you! I love you all! [music builds] [reporter 1 in English] It's a big day for BLACKPINK as "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" has become the most viewed Korean music video in 24 hours. [reporter 2] Three music videos with over 400 million views. [reporter 3] One billion views on YouTube. [music stops] [Rosé] I think when things get faster, it also becomes very overwhelming at some points. [inhales] Yeah. [Lisa in Thai] I still remember the first time… [screaming] [Lisa] I went back to Thailand after my debut. Because Thai teens see me as a Thai who has made it this far. They would say, "I want to be like Lisa." [crowd chanting] Lisa! WELCOME HOME LISA WE MISSED YOU [crowd screaming] [Lisa in Thai] But at that moment, I wasn't sure if I was really good enough to be their role model. [in Korean] I'm a singer… but I didn't know what kind of singer I wanted to be. I kind of lost the goal. I was trying to find myself. [in Thai] Could I really become their role model? What should I do to not let them down? These kinds of thoughts kept running through my mind. [crowd cheering] [Jennie in English] We need sugar. [in singsong voice] We need sugar. -[Jisoo] One spoon. -One spoon. [Jisoo in Korean] You like this too. Tanghulu is different. [Jennie] Tanghulu has the sweetness of the fruits. The ratio is a little off because we haven't made it in a while. -There was too much sugar. -It's a bit burnt. -It still looks delicious. -Yeah. [in English] This is actually a Chinese traditional snack, but it's hard to find it here in Korea. [Jisoo in Korean] We almost started a fire once. -We were making too much. -Yeah, we almost burnt it. We almost made this dorm disappear. [chuckles] [Jennie in English] This is a way of me teaching Jisoo to speak English. She got better in the last six months. She understands everything that I say, so I do talk to her in English sometimes. -[Jennie in Korean] How is it? -Mm. Is it good? I want a taste. It's warm. [crunching] It's a bit burnt. Mm! [in English] Not bad. Not bad but not good. Yeah. Let's be honest. It was a fail. Yes. [in Korean] No. We didn't add any water. -What are you talking about? -No, you don't add water. Unnie! You add water. You add water? No, you don't add water. What am I going to do about you? Nothing works without me. [in English] In Korea, one of the first things you ask, other than your name, is how old are you? And as soon as they say they're older, it's like, "Oh, you're unnie." So, unnie is basically what you call an older sister. It's like-- [in Korean] Other places don't have it. [in English] We don't call each other by names. It's normally unnie if you're older than me, and oppa if you're a guy. It takes a while to get used to, but once you get a hold of it, it's better than calling their names. She's not Jisoo. She's unnie. It's like family, in a way. [in Korean] When I first came to train as a singer, I had never tried singing or dancing before. I was lost, but you taught me a lot. For two of us, it was-- The competition was fierce at the time. There were about 20 to 30 trainees. Because we are the older ones of the group, the others came to us with the issues they were having. I knew what their problems were. They'd ask us, "Unnie, what should we do?" And I'd advise them to speak their mind, but they have a hard time doing that, so I end up taking care of it. There's no doubt I feel a sense of responsibility. I try the best I can to take care of the other girls. [crunching] [in English] It's okay, actually. I could eat this. [in Korean] Semi-success. [man in English] Okay. It's just Rosé and the beat. -Oh, my God! -No words, no melody whatsoever. [man] So here we go. [playful, upbeat music playing] ♪ Can't sleep at night ♪ ♪ But would it be all right ♪ ♪ If I stay, if I… ♪ ♪ No, it shouldn't be a problem No, it shouldn't be a problem ♪ [Rosé] You know how when people say they're afraid of heights or they're afraid of water? I've always been so afraid of getting in the studio or writing something. I always thought just someday I have to just start it. I have to. [vocalizing] [music stops] -I'm gonna still keep this one. -Okay. -Let's try one more time. -Okay. Do I change the rhythm? I keep going for the same thing. -Do you feel uncomfortable singing it? -Do I feel uncomfortable singing it? Like slightly. Maybe I'll try singing it one more time. I've seen Joe a few times, and his music's like amazing. I was just like, to Teddy, "What do you think if he helps me out?" So here's what we worked on. This is Rosé's first recorded song. [Rosé] We even saved this whole file in this secret folder because I said nobody can listen to it. I was like, "Hide it from everyone." ♪ Wouldn't be a problem No, it shouldn't be a problem ♪ When it comes to writing songs, Rosé has certain stories in mind. And she's shy about sharing that story. It's just super personal to her. It's like her diary. [Rosé laughs] Oh, my gosh! You sounded nervous in that one. Yeah. I'm like, "I don't know what I'm doing." [giggles] I was thinking it'd be fun if I write something like… [sings in Korean] ♪ After two, three o’clock… ♪ ♪ When I call you ♪ ♪ And when you see my call… ♪ [laughs nervously] Something like that. -I think it's fine. -I want to hide right now. -No. -I don't think I can do this. [laughs] [in English] Teddy told me yesterday too. He was like, "You need to learn how to be more vulnerable in the studio." That's something I can't do too easily, but I was gonna say-- -[Joe] I mean, it takes time. -Yeah. I really have a lot of respect for music, so I don't wanna be just like another girl who sings and just kind of tells everybody that she writes music. That's the last thing I wanna be. -Whoa, I need one of these. -[Joe] Yeah. -[Rosé] Oh, my gosh. -[plays chords] I feel more intimidated when I'm by myself. When I'm in my room by myself, and I go, "Should I try and write something?" I think I'm way more intimidated then. 'Cause it's just me. I don't know if my opinions are right, and that scares me. I feel like I scare myself the most. [playing melody] [Joe] Okay, let's record that. What's our tempo? I found these chords maybe like a month ago. I was like-- I liked it. I was like, "This sounds cool." And ever since then, I just play it. [Joe] If anything, I was gonna put you in the booth and sing over it. [Rosé giggles] Okay. Do you think I could do it? I've never tried this. [Joe] I think you can do it. Let's just give it a try. [piano melody playing] [hums along] [giggles] It's nice to have just the right amount of people in the room, who are just there to accept whatever is there and make it into something. [humming] Joe always says, "This is the safe ground. Everything's a secret in here." "You can make a fool out of yourself, and we won't tell anyone." Ah. It feels just like expressing myself. Whereas I would always sing songs of other artists. That's more like borrowing their emotions and making it mine. Whereas this is totally just speaking from my point of view. [vocalizing] I'm almost like a baby trying to speak in the music, trying to sing… for the first time. [continues vocalizing] -[giggles] I lost it again. -[Joe] We got it. [Jennie] Lisa, should I wear this on my way back? [Rosé in Korean] Kuma! [in English] BLACKPINK hoodie? -I think you should. -[Jennie] Right? Hello. Ah, ow! You just bit me. Coco bit me. Ah! Coco like, "I don't care." [Jisoo in Korean] I have so many clothes, but there's not enough space, so I keep them on the balcony. [laughs] Don't we have to pack for the event in Japan? You have to bring something like this. It's cold. -Bring a scarf too. -Oh, I don't have a scarf! -Give me one. -You are funny. -Give me one. -I can't. That's not a scarf. It is so tiring when we work, but when we don't work, I get stressed out about not working. I think it's that. It's a dilemma. When we work, I really want to rest, but when we don't work, I end up wondering, "What am I doing?" [Rosé] This job has a lot of ups and downs. [Jisoo] There's nothing we can do about it. It's very random, and there's no regularity. The thing is, you can never tell how long this will last, so estimating is impossible. That's most challenging. [Jennie in English] This year has been on the road. This year has been pack and unpack, and unpack and pack and unpack. That's a song. [grunts] [Jennie] At least right now, we're prepared enough to plan the resting part, 'cause last year, we were just like spending time like… And then the tour hit us, and we're like, "Oh, my God." [Rosé] Yeah. ["Really" playing] [Jisoo in Korean] I think we were together for three years before we went on the world tour. [Jennie in English] It was a long tour, about nine months. [Lisa in Korean] We started the world tour in Asia, but Coachella marked the start of our tour in North America. [Rosé in English] When they said that we're gonna start going outside of Asia, that was like a dream. [in Korean] And blow them kisses here and stuff, because you're coming out during the chorus before you kiss. Oh, the next chorus? You're coming out during the chorus before you kiss. You want me to come out before that chorus? Come out slowly and play here. It was getting boring when you stay out there for too long. [Lisa] A much more diverse group of fans will be looking forward to seeing us. [Rosé in English] We wanted to bring them the best show possible. [choreographer in Korean] Whether it be "Playing With Fire" or "Boombayah"… you don't look like you're dancing hard enough. -We're not dancing hard enough? -Not hard enough. The audience needs to be mesmerized by your energy, up close. I know that you guys know the dance well, but put in a bit more effort. Jisoo, you need to get the notes right. You messed up on the rhythm before, right? Too fast? I practiced with MR for the first time when I got here. [choreographer] The notes are a bit unstable when you first go in. But we shouldn't have said that on camera. Hey… [bleeping] [all laugh] They'll never air this. [crowd screaming] [reporter 1 in Korean] The media says that K-pop queens have landed. [in English] BLACKPINK, welcome to Thailand. Yay! [in Korean] Girl group BLACKPINK heat up their first world tour stop, Thailand. It's special to have a concert in Lisa's hometown. [fans cheering] [Lisa in Thai] This is the first concert where BLACKPINK has been able to meet our Thai fans. We will do our very best and will not disappoint the BLINKS. [crowd chanting] BLACKPINK! [cheering loudly] [Jisoo in Korean] I want to give a performance that I can look at and be content with. My focus is leaving the stage having given a performance I have no regrets about. [audience cheering] So when I get out there, I'm thinking, "Don't mess this up." [cheering continues] [Jisoo] "You've got to nail this." -[beat drops] -["Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" playing] [singing in Korean] [Jennie in English] Since it was our very first world tour, it's amazing to see all these fans filling up the big arenas that we didn't expect. [cheering] [Lisa in Korean] Everything was new to me on my first tour. It was so great to meet so many fans around the world. [fans chanting] [Jennie in English] Once it gets going, for, like, the next 30 days, to try to give them the best stage every day is a lot of pressure. [screaming] [Jennie] After so many plane rides and so many environment changes, our body just gives up on us. -[in Korean] It feels like it's sprained. -Is it worse on this side? [Jennie in English] When I'm home, I like to workout and take care of my body 'cause I'm like a grandma. I'm sick everywhere. Honestly, I need to take care of myself. I lose breath a little easier than other people, and I can't jump as much as other people. [Rosé] I think, at first, I didn't know what I was headed towards. [staff] Okay. Let's go. I thought it would all be just really exciting and fun. [music stops] [in Korean] I’m going to eat it without ketchup. [Rosé in English] In the middle of it, I didn't feel like I had a personal life. It felt like there was this big hole in my life. What I'm basically living for is tomorrow's show. I love being on stage because that's when I feel the most alive, yet when we come back to the hotel, I felt so empty. [in Korean] I'm hungry, so I ordered something simple. [in English] Poached eggs. Ta-da! And that's when I realized I'm homesick. [in Korean] Delicious. [in English] Yeah! Let's go! [laughs] [Jennie] Lisa is the most constant one. She brings positive energy into the group. [Jisoo in Korean] If someone is fed up one day… [laughs] …she makes that person laugh. She keeps us energized. [mouthing song] [Lisa in English] Sometimes I feel like… [in Korean] …I think I overreact a lot. Or I tend to try to bring too much positivity when the mood is sour. -[Jennie in English] But it really helps. -Really? -Yeah. -Okay. I'll keep doing that. -Keep going. -Yeah, keep going, Lisa! [laughs] [vocalizing] [Rosé] How we stay tight as a group is we try to take care of ourselves individually, and then come together healthy and happy so that the whole thing works. [Jennie] Sometimes, when I look like I'm really tired and angry, that is my happy face. We're all human, and we're ladies, so we have our moments. But when you have the good positive energy going on, it helps. [airplane roars] Los Angeles, what's up? We're BLACKPINK on 97.1 AMP radio. [radio host] You guys, the first female Korean group to perform at Coachella. -[all members] Oh, my gosh! -What? [reporter] The K-pop girl band called BLACKPINK is in the US this weekend. [Lisa in Thai] Because it's such a big festival, when I was told that we were going, I couldn't believe it. [in English] Are we going to Coachella? BLACKPINK? Are you sure? [in Thai] Is this for real? [Jisoo in Korean] Look over there! [Rosé in English] I'm so excited. This is cool! It was really nerve-wracking. We're a group from South Korea representing our country. [Jennie] We were just so ready to tell the world that we've been waiting for this. [in Korean] Since we don't have much time… [in English] …we're gonna skip "Stay," and we're gonna go from "Whistle" and "Kiss and Make Up." [Lisa in Korean] I was so nervous because I didn't know how our American fans would react. [Rosé in English] Usually, a BLACKPINK tour is filled with fans who come to watch us, but people who come to Coachella are just people who love music in general. I personally was really worried that not many people would walk up to our show. [Jennie] I didn't even think we would have, I don't know, 100 people or 200 people at least. I was just hoping to have somebody watching us. [Jisoo in Korean] I was so sick. That was the sickest I've ever been. My back was killing me. It hurt to move. -I was pretty worried. -We were very worried. [staff 1] Break a leg. [staff 2] We're following Coachella. [in English] Let's go. [Jisoo in Korean] When I got onto that stage, I actually didn't realize that there were so many people. [cheering] [Rosé] Why are there so many people? [Jennie] I don't know. There are so many people. [crowd cheering] -[Jennie] We can do it. -[Lisa] We can do it. It's fine. [all] One, two, three! Go! [staff] Jennie and Rosé, that way. Water, water, water! Eye drops, somebody! Relax. [staff] We're starting now! [Lisa in Thai] I was so nervous. The moment I stepped foot on the stage and saw all the crowds shouting and cheering… [crowd screaming] [Lisa] …I got the feeling, "This is it!" -♪ BLACKPINK! ♪ -["Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" playing] ♪ Oh yeah, oh yeah ♪ [singing in Korean] [Jennie in English] I think Coachella was the moment where I felt like there are people that understand that this isn't just K-pop music.

So it helped emphasize… [in English] …this represents BLACKPINK. ["Playing With Fire" playing] [singing in Korean] [Jennie in English] I'm happy to be in an era where people are open to new culture, new music.

[singing in Korean] [Lisa in Thai] It makes me feel that… I had chosen the right path. This was what I really wanted to do in my life. [music ends] [crowd cheering] [Lisa in English] We had so much fun. I think I'll remember today for the rest of my life. [Jennie] We love you guys! -[Jisoo] Thank you, guys! -[Lisa] Thank you so much. [cheering continues] [Rosé] Goodnight! [reporter] There's been lots of news coming from Coachella, but one group that has everybody talking is BLACKPINK. If you didn't know who they were before, you definitely know who they are now. [in Korean] After Coachella, I think I figured out how to have fun on stage. Don't concentrate on just yourself, but feed off this passion raging around you. [in English] Have fun. Have fun with this. ["As If It's Your Last" playing] [singing in Korean] [Lisa in Thai] It doesn't matter if we grow old and get replaced by a new younger generation.

And I feel like all four of us, we did really well, and I'm very proud of each and every one of us. -'Cause we went through a lot. -[crowd screaming] [giggles] Like, I know you guys only see the stuff that's on stage, but I feel like we all go through so much else… [voice breaks] …and I'm very proud. [Lisa] Aw! [crowd cheering] [Rosé] During the shows, we're always looking out and talking to the audience. Then I was talking, and I kinda looked at my members, and I was like, "Ah!" Then I started crying. Because it felt like the first time talking to, you know, each. Like, I feel like it's so hard that everybody stays away from home… [sniffles] Happy tears. -Happy tears. -Happy tears. It's okay. [cheering] [Jennie] And every time we're in Thailand, I get really emotional. -[all giggling] -I don't know why. -Now I'm gonna cry. I don't want to cry. -[Rosé] Everybody's gonna cry. -[Jisoo] Everyone, cry. -[Rosé] Everyone, cry! [laughs] Aw! So, it's like a train. It's me and then Jennie unnie. And if she cries, then Lisa cries, and then… [in Korean] I don't cry. [laughs] I don't cry. I cry last. [crowd cheering] [shutter clicking] [in English] Thank you so much for coming. Bye! Bye.

[crowd screaming] [Rosé] We grew into something that we didn't even know was possible. And as much as fans are surprised with the outcome, we are as well. And so, it feels like a journey that they're on with us. Bye-bye! [Jennie] When somebody asks me, "Do you have pressure about it?" I'm like, "No," because I feel like we're doing a great job, and we have more to show you guys. It's just the beginning. [crowd continues cheering] [cheering fades] [Lisa in Korean] Meat, meat! [waiter] Careful of the hot plate. -[Rosé] That looks amazing! -[Jisoo] Can I have a bite? [Lisa in English] Thank you. -[Rosé in Korean] Do you know us? -Yes. -Weren't you here before? -[Jisoo] Yes, that's right. -We were here when we were trainees. -[waiter] Yes, you guys ate here. -I remember. -[Lisa] I've been here since the start. [waiter] I didn't give you good service. [chuckles] [Jisoo] Really? Is that why you're so nice now? Yes. I hope you enjoy the food. -[waiter] Thank you. -[Lisa] Thank you. Totally. [Rosé] Halsey contacted me all of a sudden. [Jennie] She was at Paris? [in English] She's like, "You in Paris?" I'm like, "Don't tell me you're here." It was my first time meeting her. I felt like it was my fifth time. And she said the same. Like, "Was this our first time?" I'm like, "Yeah." She's just like us. She just talks like us. -[Jennie] Is she from America, or… -Yeah, I think she's from LA? [Lisa] LA! Come on, LA! -[in Korean] I want to live in Paris. -Me too! For a year. -We will stay for a year. -[Jisoo] You're Parisian already. After a year, I'd like to go to the US. I want to live in Paris, but I also want to live in the US and England. [Lisa] Twenty years? [Jisoo] I feel like Lisa would be traveling around the world. [in English] Forty three? -[Lisa] I'm gonna be 40? -[Rosé] I'm gonna be 42. -[Lisa] Gonna be 40. -[Rosé] We're gonna be 42. I feel we'll all be-- Do you think we'll all be married by then? -[Rosé] I think we might. -Of course! It's 40… Like, come on! [Jennie] I don't know about babies, but… [in Korean] …I think we'd all be married. We'd have babies by then. Forty-two, 44… [Jisoo] We'll have children? If not, we could also get married later in life. [Jisoo] We'll be freshly married? No newborns! Aren't we going to make a comeback? [Jisoo] At that age? BLACKPINK! [hums tune] We'll injure our backs! [Jisoo] I don't think we'll be able to dance. We'll have to stand.
