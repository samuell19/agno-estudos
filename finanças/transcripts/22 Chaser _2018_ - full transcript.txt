Listen, they're going to get you out. We'll get you right side up, and I'll tow you out of here! What happened to the other guy? He doesn't touch accidents. Don't worry! I got you. You're going to be just fine. What about the cyclist? Is she OK? [police radio in the background] The cyclist? Sorry, man. It doesn't look good. She's not moving! - [crying] I'll walk, man. - Yeah, I know. [Elvis] It happens that fast. [Elvis] Man, that's the cops coming. [Elvis] Hey, listen man. You seem like a good guy. If you want, I could tell the cops that I saw the whole fucking thing. I was here the whole time, and that it was the cyclist's fault. Would you do that for me? [Elvis] Sure! I got to make sure that it's worth my while. You know what I mean? It's just that fair is fair. How much? I'll get my machine. [nervy music] That's how it's done. [moaning] [crying] Sir! Hey, Sir! I don't know who's at fault here but... You didn't kill her. Oh, thank God! There is another driver here. He's a good friend of mine. He works for the same company I do. Jack Rabbit Towing. Use him. OK. [police sirens approaching] [indistinct talking on the radio] [police sirens] [dispatcher] Rise and grind, Jack Rabbits! You want to get paid?

You can collect your car around the back. Jack Rabbit Towing. We hop, to it! 12, Harbour Square. 15, minutes. Who wants to take an engine boost at 12 Harbor? I could use it, actually. Yeah, you could use it. One tow ate up your whole morning. Well. I had to stay on scene. Cops wanted a statement. Why did you call 911 in the first place? That's what people do. Hi! Hi! Wait, wait! Open! Open! What does it taste like? Tartar? Not a shred of meat. How do you do that? Little bit of this, little bit of that. I'm trying an all veggy dinner tonight. I thought we were going to grill something tonight. Yeah. We... Are dry. So, how did you get all this? A foodbank. [Zack moaning] We talked about this, OK? - I know we did. - I was... I'm serious. You can't keep starting fights. I'm always being a cock wipe. Do you think I'm playing around? I'm trying! I'm trying. What happened, Zack? He wouldn't give me a turn on his bike. He said I dress like a welfare case. I'd give his bike bedbugs. He said "poor people walked". Hey! I'll get you a bike. I'll get you a bike. Your own bike for your birthday. Your very own bike. A welfare bike. What do you have in mind? Show it to me. What! That's a good looking bike. I'm going to get you this bike for your birthday. If... You promise me you stop getting into those fights. You need to show me that... That you're going to be a civilized little man. - Promise? - I promise. [Ben] Zack! You know that you're named after your grandfather, right? That was my dad. He was just a mechanic, but he was the most civilized man in that town. Everybody liked Zachary. Do you want to know why? He didn't use his fists. He used his words. [Ben] He said: "Never wrestle with pigs". You'll always end up dirty. And pigs like it. [Zack] Why do the pigs like it? [Ben] I don't know, buddy. Pigs are pigs. [loud honking] - Hey! Bylaw! - Hey, Chaser! You're not dragging your sack anymore. Did Bissey finally buy you some new gear? No, he wouldn't open his wallet for this thing. I had to tool new mufflers from scraps. Built new custom cold air intake, retimed her. Saving on fuel. And getting like 20% extra horses. Arts and freaking craft. What's the story there? Freaking owner want's it brought to the dealership in Oakfield. That's 200 for the outer city service charge. One fifty for the mileage. So I tell the moron that I'm going to need put it on Dolly's. That's another 150 right there. We're looking at an almost seven bills before I take it to Jeano's who's gonna give kickbacks on repairs. And this is my forth wreck Of the shift. - Dickhead! - How about you? How much is that little minnow get ya? About 65 bucks. It makes more if it sits in the lock collecting impound fees. [radio] At the diner, two vehicle collision. We rendered a tractor trailer. See what I mean? I can't keep up with these crazy drivers - crashing into each other. - Hi, Sitting Bull! You're hiding behind treaty rights? Ah! Fuck! I need two trucks! Stay gold, Jack Rabbit. [honking] [Avery] What did you do with Zack? He's been watching TV at Debbies. It's okay for like 20 minutes. [Avery] He's been talking about that bike all day. 300 dollar bike. He's not going to grow up like those losers we knew in high school. It's worth every penny. We can't even afford grocery's. Avery! Hey! I'll pick up more??? on patrol. I'll work seven days a week. Whatever we need. Do you ever think about going home? No, ma'am. No, ma'am. Because my wife is going to open the sweetest restaurant you've ever seen. I'm going to have a garage right around the corner customizing cars for DJ's and rappers. And every day after work I'm going to sit at that bar and my wife is going to yell at me for how filthy my hands are. I'm going to bawl my eyes out When we call our little boy. He's off at university studying to be a real aerospace... technician... engineer... I don't care. I will be so happy. [Avery] You're ridiculous. Yes. You're lucky you're so cute. You better watch it, your hands are fucking filthy. What the fuck? You guys are standing around like a bunch of pylons? Sit down, you lazy cunts. None of you assholes deserve this but we won the police contract! The fucking police contract! Alright, settle down before you start giving each other reach-arounds. This is one piece of the jackpot. You got to put some skin on the game, alright? That means no one drives my trucks for free. From now on you lease your trucks from Jack Rabbit. You're kidding, right? - Alright? - I got a mortgage. Hey, rah, rah fucking la. Tomorrow afternoon I'm going to have guys lined up all around the fucking block. Drivers, just like yourselves begging to give me first and last so they too can suckle off that big fat fucking titty of a police contract. So think on it, guys. My wife is going to drop off the leasing arrangements, and when she does, you come and see me with money in hand. Come up with first and last. Otherwise, get the fuck off my lot. Jesus Christ! [driven music] That's shitty, man. Losing your truck right When you hit the jackpot. For me I'd... I'd give some serious thought of going back home. Maybe they'll let you teach auto at the old Alma Mater. All those tight high school girls hot for the teacher? Go, Trojans, go, right? I'm not going home. I'm not going backwards. I'm not walking away from that police contract, just... Where is Avery in all this? I thought that she had her heart set on that cooking school, right? [woman] Yeah, I know. My wife thinks I should take it to the dealer. No, that's four dollars a kilometer. But I know a body shop that specializes in fine cars. They work fast. That's where I take my baby. OK! That's another 15 points from Kaleb. Kickbacks on repairs it's, way better than mileage. Actually I... I was thinking about that guy Ray Junior?? Yeah! Yeah, No. Ray is a good guy. Good call, totally. How fast can you get me in touch with him? Are you Ray? Ben! [Ben] I like your office. [both laughing] - Have a sit. - Yes, Sir. Oh, my gosh! Five thousand, Ray's way. Ray's way means payments due every week on time. No bitching, no crying, no grief. Five grand principle. One grand interest. Comes back to me. 750 a week for eight weeks. Starting next week. Just so you know, I'm not going to start earning till that police contract kicks in. My buddy in traffic services says it's a done deal. They are just ironing out the fine print with your boss, right? 750 next week. Could make me send my wife back to the food bank. I'm not really making you do anything. First and last. I'm glad you're sticking around. We are going to have a great fucking year. Money is on the road. No, no! You don't! Ma'am! Let go! OK, ma'am. What are you... Hey, hey! No! Not a good idea! Ma'am! Excuse... Oh, God! Hey! Fuck you! Did you get into any fights today? No! [police siren] - Your late! - Yes, it's a slow week. Waiting on that police contract to come through. That's not my department. You guys said it's going to be any day now. Your boss is not doing his part to close the deal. That's between him and them, this is between you and me. I got to ding you for a late fee. Second, there's interest on the late fee, daily. And there is interest on the amount that you're short. OK, alright! Next week, I promise. Promise. Drive safe, Sir. Thank you so much for meeting me here. You've been so helpful, I... And, have you managed to get any kitchen experience? Nothing long term. I can't staff a decent kitchen without any training. And I can't get any training because I'm working all the time. But I was thinking that you might look into some grants? Yeah, I could put together some options. The application do take a while. Yeah! What about short term? Where are you at with family support? We used up all of my husbands inheritance just to move here. Wich was basically like just his dad's car. And my mom is pretty toxic. We had a bad moment which is part of the reason for why we left. Your husband has a permanent job. What happened with his paycheck this week? I don't even know what's... You don't know how your husband spends his money? [indistinct police radio] What are they saying? That one is police dispatch. That one is fire. And those two there is your ambulance. [police radio] Dad doesn't have scanners. That because your dads bylaw. All he does is tow parked cars. But if you're a chaser... Scanners are your best friend. Listen real close for accidents so you can get there first and get the best tow. It's like a... Like a race. Chasers are pigs. I know your dad doesn't like playing dirty. And that worked great for him when he was a captain on the high school hockey team. He scored a lot of goals, he scored your mom. Now... Now, he's got no wing-man. He's got no horces to back him up. That's why his stuck out there looking for tows so late. And you are stuck here when your mom's at work. [Sean] Here! It's on me. Jesus! What are you packing here? About 20 pounds of rice and lentils. Charity again. They're a life saver. If you ever need a little extra... Even if it's just to keep Zack in after school care. Thank you. I'll think about it. Hey! Get in the back! [Ben] Long shift? Mhm. I had to close again alone. Don't you have to get up in a few hours? I'm studying the routes. You know. Every second counts. Where is that police contract at? He's just closing it. [man outside] I've being charged without being told! Half the time I'm sipping coffee with... [man outside] How many times do I have to supply accountants? - What is this? - When your behind on your truck it comes straight off your pay. And you're still short a 150. [electric guitar music] - [Zack] Dad! - [Ben] Yeah. [Zack] Are you working so much because we are broke ass white trash? [Ben] Who said that? [Zack] Kamal. [Zack] He tried to start another fight. [Ben] And... Another week without a fight. The bathroom in the men's is all clogged up. Oh, OK. can I get you some coffee? No, I'm... I'm looking for your husband. Why? What happened? Nothing yet! We were supposed to meet up this morning. Now his not answering his phone. Well... If his busy with calls, it could take him a few hours before he picks up. You should try him. Tell him it's Ray. Tell him Ray really wants his money. Soon as I have a minute. I would appreciate that. Thank you. Avery. [nervy music] [phone ringing] Yeah, yeah, call the next driver on the list. I've got another truck freed up. Keep in touch, Al! Pathetic stories. What about you? We going to get your next monthly? Or is your truck freed up too? When is that police contract kicking in? Yeah, Bissey. When is it kicking in? Katy, would you mind coming in the office? I don't want to keep you waiting. It's been one of these days when we're quite busy. When, when? You sound like my fucking wife. Yeah, when? I'm in the middle of a very delicate negotiation. We will be signing either way, next week, OK? - Christ! - Next week, next week. Next week is great, that sounds fantastic. We have been waiting a lot longer than we thought. If I'm going to last another week you've got to give me an advance! Ray needs a grand today. - Huh! - And 300 next week. It's for a bike for my son. It's his birthday. Bissey, come on! This is not a lot to you. I know it's not! This is not a hand out either. I'm working hard. I'm out there 12 hours a day for you. 12 hours a day! I've been busting my ass for the last 30 years! Building this business up from nothing! For money I saved driving a truck 24 fucking 7! Eight days a fucking week! Eating so many fucking baloney sandwiches, I was shitting hotdogs out of my ass! So get in your fucking truck and earn your goddam keep! Money is on the fucking road! [slamming the door] Hey! How is she running there, 22? Hey, look. It's not that I don't want to pay you It's just that... I can't. It's cool, though. Bissey just said he's closing the contract next week. So, hit me up with those late fees. I get the interest rates... [moaning] It's Ray's way! First time you come up short you got a late fee. Second time you come up short you get a choice ankle or wrist. OK, I get it. No bitching! No crying! - Ouch! - Ankle or wrist? - A choice. - Hey please can you... OK, I'll decide. No! No! Please! [screaming in agony] Oh, my God! Not a few days. Tomorrow! Wow! There is no way this is just potato. This is amazing. Seriously, Avery you got to get on to that cooking school shit. I mean, You're... You're real chef material. You can start your own restaurant. Sean! Who the fuck is this Ray guy? How does Ben even know somebody like this? Look, yeah Ray... That's some serious shit. Personally I'd never go to a guy like that. But I'm not in Ben's shoes. Yeah, no shit. You look like you've done pretty good for yourself. Of course I am. I'm a chaser. What am I supposed to do? Is this fucking guy going to show up on my doorstep or something? You've got to pay him. Would you be able to... Not if it's a hardship or anything, but... Do you think you could help us out, just for a little while? Yeah, totally. How much do you need? I don't know. I need five grand. To stay ahead of cash flow. Of course, yeah. Thank you! You know what? Don't even sweat it. It's OK. - You're going to make it. - Yeah. [door closes] Ben! What the hell happened? [Avery] Did this Ray do this to you? [Avery] Ben! [rustling of pills in a jar] So, Sean is going to help us out. No! Are you fucking nuts? OK, you guys have some stuff to... I'll swing by Zack's party tomorrow. Go, Trojan's, go! Tell me you don't see what he's doing? He's helping us out. Don't need his kind of help. So, you won't take money from your best friend but you take money from a loan shark with a fucking badge? Yeah. Did he break your brain too? Police contract starts next week. I just have to hold on to next week. It's Zack's birthday tomorrow. Are you even going to be there? What am I supposed to tell Zack if you're in the ICU? That you're too proud to admit that you fucked up. And you needed a way out. [fridge door slams hard] If you take a dime from him... Then we are done. [nervy music] [lock opens] Sean's scanners. Really! I'm going to give you a run for your money. Not, even. Just your crumbs then. I need to make some quick cash, man. So, here comes the chase on the best perch on the Westside? Some balls! [phone rings] Trouble on the home front? I just have to push through this rough patch. Push through to what? Police contract... And everything falls into place after that. I bet! Family gets a new swimming pool in the back yard. No, everything I make, goes to the ten year plan. Get my own shop going. Set my wife up with her own restaurant. And send my kid to university. Anything he wants to study anywhere he wants to go. That's adorable. What about you? All this cash you pull in. Are you doing this for anybody? Sure! My family back on Shoal Lake 40. They are stuck on an island under a 20 year boil water advisory while their clean water gets pumped away to Winnipeg. And the government still doesn't build them an access road. So, all the bucks I send home just so they can bring in bottled water on the ferry. [laughing] Nah! I just like getting paid to drive like an asshole. Money is on the road. Money is on the road. But so are the other chasers. [loud car horn] Hi, Wayne! Elvis. Are you running a special needs day care? Jack Rabbit 22 wants to chase tonight. Are you shitting me? On our fucking turf? Hey, I'm back to bylaw first thing tomorrow, OK. Why don't you take that perfumed vagina back to the knitting club, and stay off my road! [radio voice] A four doors not drivable. Driver and caller are on the scene. [radio voice 2] 54 on route. Well, there it is. Last one there, gets to crank my fucking shaft. Do the math's. One wreck and three of us chasers. This is it, little rabbit. Get hopping. [engine starts] [rap music] [car honking] You're really giving it a lot of sauce, Elvis. Oh, yes I'm fucking giving them the sauce. These new bitches 2 K each tire and wheel. Running around on these is like floating on big ass silicone titties. Oh, yeah! You better believe I'm giving them a massage. Oh, shit! Jack Rabbit! Did you stop for a fucking latte on the way, son? Hey, I think it might be a little hubcap rolling around if you want to tow something. [Elvis laughing] [radio voice] We got a fire rescue 224. [radio chatter] You got trouble? Hey, sailor! How much would you charge for doing something you shouldn't be doing? [hooker] He has a kink. He'll go as high as 200 to satisfy it. It's a 100 for me and a 100 for you. Hey! [Avery] It's almost eight o'clock. Where the hell are you? I'm... I'm pulling a double. [Ben] Chasing. Eat! So... Do you think that we can at least talk about taking money from Sean? I don't know, I think I might be in love. Oh, yeah? Riding around on this tires. It is a sexual experience. I mean... In my mind I picture these two fat, black bitches and I got them all sauced up and they're on the rig. And under the rig I got a gas pedal attached. And I hit the gas pedal and they just start fucking spinning. And then the rig brings them closer together, right? But like just close enough that I can get my fucking dick in there. And I mean... I just want to go at it. [Elvis]I really just want to go at it. Fuck, I think I can properly build something like that. I got the spot for it all picked out in my basement. I'm talking fucking nice, right? Like... I don't know. Let's make it... Actually romantic. [Ben whispering] Thank you, so much. I didn't brush my teeth. It's OK, buddy. Listen. I'm just talking to you. You're tired. I got to go back to work. Mom is going to be home soon. Are you going to be OK? I invited Kamal to my birthday party tomorrow. I think we can be friends. I'm going to let him have a ride on my new bike. Like a peace offering. Look at you. Turning into a real man. I'm so proud of you. Go back to sleep. I love you, buddy. I love you, dad. I'm sorry. Will you call me? When you're finishing up here? Call me. I'll pick you up. We'll talk about this. You mean if you're not too busy chasing body bags? You jump in here, and then race around like some raged out shithead? Are you actually trying to kill yourself? - What do you want from me? - I'm scared. Look at you! You're all fucking smashed up. And jacked up! Avery, I made that kid a promise. All we do is make promises. We can't live off fucking promises any more. This is our actual life. Why don't you go home. Go home and be with your son! And tomorrow we are going to throw him a fucking amazing birthday party like a normal family. And then we will figure this shit out. You are not going to make what we need in one fucking night, Ben. Watch me! [radio voices] ...we have a collision... [radio voices] ...two cars and a motor cycle... [radio voices] We're heading up there. Yes! [honking] [honking] Are you OK? This is my vehicle. I'll take you. [police officer] Can you tell me what happened tonight? What happened is that that idiot came out of nowhere. [police officer] Have you been drinking tonight? [counsellor] Do you know who I am? [police officer] I know who you are, counsellor. [person] Is there anybody in there? [Ben] Hi, Sir! Hi, I'm here! Hold on. [woman] I was just waiting for the bus. I can't see at all. Hey, Jack Rabbit! What the hell are you doing? Driving an ambulance or a tow truck? He's hurt! Does he have a vehicle? Alright, let's go to the ambulance, OK? [Ben] It's right over here. [loud car horn] [sirens] I hate... Just keep going, just walk that way, OK? - [Ben] Just keep going. - [victim] Which way? - Sir, I'm giving him to you. - [victim] Hello? Which way? - First on scene here! - First on scene. Good for you. Excuse me, ma'am! Are you in need of assistance this evening? [officer] Hey! No soliciting on my scene. Step back! Not a problem, officer. First truck, right there. - I was first on scene. - First truck, right there. First truck, step back! Step back! Just so you know It's a 100 % up to you. You do not have to feel guilty about saying no to a driver that you know... Hey, makes you feel unsafe. What are you doing here? Are you trying to poach my tow? Do you think I'm letting a fucking tow be poached by a bylaw fucking driver? Ma'am, talk about unsafe? Look at this. He did that all doing a tow. He dropped a car on it. He might do that to yours. You're not insured for that. Hey! What did I say! Yes, absolutely, officer. First truck. First truck. Hi, ma'am. Gosh! I know this is a terrible shocking thing. The general public has the perception that tow truck operators are violent dishonest ambulance chasers that they're animals, really. But you can be assured that I am trained. I'm going to be there for you With professionalism and compassion - to look after you in this... - ma'am. I got your fucking tow. Get on! I will impound your ride. Is it true that I have a choice? Yes! Then I chose him. It's entirely up to you. You, hook it up! Yes, sir. Do you want to follow me? Excuse us. Fucking bylaw driver. I am familiar with the various garages in the city. Where they're located, prices... Who's honest, who's not. I can't recommend a garage for you. I can certainly tell you where I would take my vehicle if I was in your situation. [crying] Come on, Kaleb. I can count. It's ten points. I see two grands of work. That's ten points on two grand. I want the 15 points that everybody else gets. Who told you 15? Sean. Ben. You're lucky to get anything tonight. Usually I don't give advances. I appreciate that, Kaleb. I really do, but... See this. No Mather how I scrub the grease doesn't come off. My wife is embarrassed for me. But... This is the business God has blessed me with. I'm grateful for everything I have, All of us are supposed to be grateful. Even for the grease. Look, this is Physio Clinic. Tell the driver to go and heal. And they will kickback ten points. She doesn't need Physio... It feels fine tonight, sure. But unless she gets treatment... Maybe two days from now she's not able to get out of bed. Tell her that. Dude, you're killing me. Ben. Bring to me a Porsche, a Beemer. A Mercedes. I will shower your loins with gold. [car honking] [Elvis] Jack Rabbit! [car door slams] [door locked] You got a sec to chat? I guess. Good! We can't go on all night fighting over turf. Well, OK. Let's... Be civilized about this. First off... - How much... - I forbid you fighting - on my watch. - How much? 200 dollars. 200? Fuck me! Let's take a look here. Oh! Here is 20! This is for my gas and my time chasing you, you fuck stick. Here is my 200. You got 20 left. I'm going to leave that with you. I'm only going to take what's rightfully fucking owed me! How is that for civilized? What? I can't fucking hear you! Hey! [screaming in agony] He gets it! I think it's time you go home, son. And take a nice long douche. [moans] Frankly B. I'd rather you be here than that fucking psycho. Savage fucking pigs! No, no. Leave the poor pigs out of this. Do you know what's civilized? Men? Cheating, raping and killing everything in their way. Civilization is a freaking highway of bones. You want a place on that road? Pay the goddamn toll. Good luck, Bylaw. [car honking] Who beat me to it? I'm going to be up front with you. I hurt my leg really bad. I can barely drive. I need more time. Come here! Have a bratwurst. A police contract starts next week. Next week. Show me one ounce of mercy. I will make next week and every week after that. Raise way for life. You are not getting the police contract. Bisseysaid we're getting the contract. His full off shit. Yeah, he won the police contract. Then lawyers went through the thing and found out that Bissey's wife was a co-owner of a chop shop that got busted a few years back. And that's not a big deal. Except that all of Bissey's trucks are in her name. So, yeah you're getting the police contract. You know when? Fucking never. Look! Take the bratwurst. Go ahead, take it! I've got something to show you. Come here. Come on! [moaning] It's not up to me, but... I answer to the guys who control the money. They only care about one thing. Turns out that this piece of shit here, he ain't good for it. - No, No! Don't! - [man screaming in agony] - [Sean] Hey! - [Avery] Hey! Alright, so... Party decorations, cake ingredients. I also got him a little something. Not much. A bit of wrapping so... I'll take care of that. Well. This is to get Ray off your back. It's five grand. Thank you so much for this. You have no idea how much it means. Sure I do. [man moaning] That's you. You're next. Don't point at me with that fucking stick! Fuck! What the fuck is wrong with you? What do you want? What can I do? I can't work if I'm hurt! I'm no good like that! Fair point. Beautiful family. Avery's a peach. Zack, uh! Beautiful. So, I'll just drop by your house tomorrow at the party you're having in the afternoon for him. How did you know about that? It's called Trojans Call. Look! About Ben... He's a fucking loser. You know that now, right? I can get us a nice house. I can help you open the restaurant. I can put Zack in a good school. Easily. 'Cause I know that we will fit together so fucking good, baby. So fucking good. Come on, Avery. Come on, baby. [moaning] Avery, come on! Fuck! Avery! You know what they say? You only lend money to friends, if you don't expect it back. Five grand that's...
