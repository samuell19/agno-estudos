BASED ON THE NOVEL "LE MOINDRE MAL" BY JEAN LABORDE BERTIN INDUSTRIAL TANNERY Are you sure you're pregnant? Of course. What's wrong? You been here a while? It'll be a boy, you know. And what if it's a girl? I don't like girls. That's a new one. What did you do to yourself? Nothing. - Hi, Stéphane. - Hi. How are you this morning, Miss Olivier? I'm fine, thanks. Mrs. Bertin! It's Élodie. Ma'am! Mrs. Bertin is not in her room. She didn't sleep here. Didn't she go to her sister's yesterday? She wasn't back yet when Gustave and I left at six. She slept there, it's not the first time she has. Usually, she lets us know. You should call her. To hear my sister-in-law in the morning at breakfast… I'm doing it really just to make you happy, Élodie. Incidentally, I'd prepared her dinner… Françoise? - Are you kidding? - Why do you say that? She finally decided not to come home? If that's it, don't put her on, just have her send her lawyer. And say goodbye to her for me. Listen, Stéphane, that's enough, I'm not laughing. - Wait, hold on. - Stéphane! Answer me. Where is Françoise? Hello? Sir, she did come back. She had dinner here. And she took some things with her, her travel bag is gone. Oh. Hello. So, well, excuse me, there's been a little change, I hear she came back. Put her on. No, she came back but she left again. Left again? But to go where? We don't know. It seems she had dinner here, she took some things with her, her travel bag… I'm coming right now. Call the police. Aren't you jumping the gun a little? Well, if you're not afraid of looking silly, call them yourself. I have to go to the factory. Goodbye. What's all this about the police? Gandin! What are these chrysanthemums doing here? Get rid of them. But they're nice there. - Not the day for it. - It's market day, though. What am I doing, then? Shopping for groceries. And not holding your tongue any longer than usual. That will save me from passing the drum. Where did that come from? Give me the pipe wrench. Not normal for it to leak like this. These modern machines are nice, but they have issues. With the old one, it took two workers, and now, I'm all by myself! Lift the table instead of wasting time. What, you're staying under it? Lift it up, I said! There. This one produces 50% more than the other one. Less work and your buddy goes, so what are you complaining about? That's right, come on, let's get to work. Ever get your hands dirty, Bonafon? That's not my job, Mr. Bertin. You're right, a shop manager has gotta keep his hands clean. Is this yours? Put that away, will ya! Hey, Soupion. How's your wife? - Yeah, she's giving me hell again. - She's getting better, then! - Hey. - Ah, I need to talk to you. - What about? - It's almost the end of the month, and we haven't settled this overtime thing. - They won't? - There's a possibility, - if management doesn't change the rates. - Management? Where's this talk from? Your union pamphlets? There's no management here, there's a boss: me. Tabart, do you use your gloves to take a leak? Wanna leave your hands in that? Here we go, an example. Workplace safety, gotten enough shit about that! Don't change the subject! Overtime. Well, come by my office tomorrow, 10:00. He's right, what the hell! Put your gloves on! - What, I'm putting my gloves on! - Oh, my God… I've been looking for you all over. Larsac's on the phone. He's pissing me off! Don't press it, Larsac, I'm telling you my business is not for sale. Not saying your price is not good, I'm just not selling. Yep, that's it. Bye, buddy. Larsac's getting greedy. He gobbled up the Blochet deal. Poor Blochet. That's funny, I would have written "obviously" with two Ls. Oh, that doesn't surprise me from you. Let me see that. What? Aw! You're like my mother, Vanille. I wouldn't have wanted a rascal like you. Well, you'll have to recheck this balance sheet. I'd rather increase workers' shares than give it to the government. Not easy to do. - And above all: not legal. - Legal or not, figure it out. You see the car I just bought, Mr. Bertin? - Oh, that yours? - Yeah. Whatcha gonna do with that? - Pick up girls? - It helps. - I've never needed that. - They're trickier in the city. Oh, something wrong with 'em here? They're as good as anywhere else. Just gotta know how to make conversation. I've never used this kind of thing to chat to 'em. In the meantime, chat with your sister-in-law. She's asking for you. - I'll see you later. - OK. Nelly. Well, look around since you're there. And if you find her, keep her, got that? And offer the police a drink. We do that in the countryside. We're civilized. Yesterday, there were other clothes? During the day, yes. Where did the hangers go? She must have taken them too before she left. You may go, Élodie. I won't be needing you anymore. Thank you. That'll be all, thank you. This is for Stéphane. Got some nerve, that guy. If we weren't busy with something else… Well, Gaspard came, then? - And what's that lady doing? - Putting on airs. Now, she's on the phone. No, I won't leave until I've spoken to my brother-in-law. Of course, don't worry, I won't say anything about what I've found out. All right. My husband and I will be at your office at 5:00 p.m. Did you get my cigarillos? Stéphane, Élodie came by. Yeah, OK. Gotta bring the basket back. Thank you. - How are you, Gaspard? - I brought you a hare, a nice one. There's police at your place, y'know? Yes, I know. Sylvie? I was looking for you. I wanted to tell you I'm sorry about your wife. Cut the crap, will ya? What about my wife? The whole town knows, that's all. On a market day, 'course they do! I heard about it at recess. If you know, what more you want me to say? But last night, did you already know that she had left? No, of course not. Well, I have to go. I'll see you tonight. It'll be fine. Today's veal and carrots, that OK, Miss Olivier? That's fine. - The bread's coming. - Thank you, thank you. - Are you leaving? - Yes. Your sister-in-law's calling all over the place, including some big wigs. So, it's kind of above us now. Thank you for your trouble, though. Can't you eat like normal people? In a hurry. I locked Françoise's room and I'm taking the key with me. I'm meeting with the prosecutor at 5:00. I intend to press charges for the kidnapping or unlawful disappearance - of my sister. - That all? Because you know very well Françoise didn't just leave. I suppose, according to you, I'm responsible for her disappearance? I believe you're capable of anything. Coffee? In a cup, if you don't mind. That's the way you've been treating my sister as well, like this china. Only in bed. Heard I was hurting her. So… she refused to get a divorce, I kill her. You're admitting it? No, I'm just… thinking what must be going through your little head all day. 'Cause that's what you think. I killed Françoise. Slow down, slow down! Come on! Well, you're always late, man. You have to choose between the town and the business. Get me the public assistance file. But it's not on the agenda. I know it's not on the agenda, but go get me the file. It's that I have my business. Did you get my parts? Ordered them, but I'm still waiting. Oh, no… Always him. OK… Although it's not on the agenda, I'm gonna mention my wife. Since that's what you're waiting for. She's left, you know that. Where did she go? I don't know and I don't care. You know that, too. But what you don't know yet is that… whether we find her or not, I've decided to live with Miss Olivier from now on. Does anyone have anything to say? Well, you may call the meeting to order, Mr. Mayor. The meeting is now in session. Now, let's get down to business. Discussion of the budget to repair the road between the tannery and the town. Does anyone have anything to say? Well, go ahead. It's not the town's responsibility to pay for the damage done to the road by the tannery trucks. Pushing it a little, Maurois? Know how much the tannery pays in taxes here each year? That's true. I stand by my position. Not against the tannery putting bread on your table! Like it does for the whole town! Without it, this place would be deserted. That's not the point. Let me remind you, Maurois, Stéphane's taken care of the school's maintenance and without him, we wouldn't have had a school for a long time now. I know. Well, shall we put it to a vote? All in favor of the town managing the road repair work? All against? The motion has passed. You're a real piece of work. I'll lend my trucks for the work, though. It looks nicer from afar than up close. Well, come in anyway. What are you afraid of? - What if your wife comes home tonight? - I don't think so. I don't like it so much. It doesn't seem like you. Mind you, except for my room and the kitchen here… - Do you want to see my room? - I'd rather we left. What's the matter? - Hmm? - No, let me go. Why did you bring me here? Just because. - I thought you'd like it. - Well, you don't know me very well. What did you tell them at the council when you made me go out? I told them I'd decided to live with you. - But this is your wife's house. - So what? Sometimes, I wonder if you think about what you're saying. Don't be angry. Even though you're very, very cute when you're angry. Actually, if I think about it - I wonder how I could have lived here for so long with her. I've got an idea. Come on. I was born here. So was my father. My grandfather lived and died here. Why did you leave here? My wife didn't like it. What's that smell? It smells like the tannery. It's next door. - Do you come here a lot? - No. Rarely. You don't ever bring girls? Hm? It's funny… you're just giving me ideas tonight! Come on. So, it wouldn't have bothered you if I'd lived in the mansion. No. - You're amoral. Nothing bothers you. - Yep. But you were right about the house. We're better off here. And if your wife comes back? Wouldn't change anything. And… what if she still doesn't want a divorce? It still wouldn't matter. Is it really because of me you want a divorce? Yes. Because of you and… …because I couldn't take her anymore. You almost said because of the baby. Yes, I almost did. Wait a minute. Look, isn't this nice? My son will be born here in this room. People give birth in hospitals now. No, no, not for him. From day one, he'll sleep in my crib. And scream in it if he wants. And if he screams, all the better. Come here. Don't you think all this'll complicate our lives? - What do you mean, "all this"? - Well, the house, the baby. What about the baby? Well, maybe it'd be better if I didn't keep him, right? Don't ever say that again. I'll send Élodie to help you. Help you move in. I prefer to do it myself. TOWN HALL I don't know what's wrong with it. Would you mind taking a look? I don't have time today. I'm not in a hurry. Let's see, - it's 2:12… - No, it's 2:00. Maybe I'm a little fast. If you could look at it before 5:00, - that would be good for me. - Are you staying? It looks lovely, I'll go for a walk around the countryside. There's a funny smell, isn't there? Funny smell, well… Hello, ma'am. Hello, sir. What can I get you, sir? A packet of JOB rolling papers. Yes. Gummed. - Ninety cents, sir. - Yes, I know, I know. - Goodby, ma'am. - Goodbye, sir. Who is that from? - Sandrine? - La Bruyère. Very good. Now, we'll do some math. Put away this notebook and get that one. Hey, Pierrot, no noise! What are you looking for? Chrysanthemum indicum. Very nice variety. They are magnificent. I'll say it again: what are you looking for? My name is Noblet, Fernand Noblet, the investigating judge. I'm coming down. Magnificent. Don't worry, won't kill anyone. Mr. Bertin, I suppose? Are you a hunter? Sometimes. I'm not running. I'm moving. I wasn't told you were coming. What do you mean you weren't? My clerk was supposed to call you. Young people these days, eh! Did you walk here? My car's in the garage, I broke down, I don't know what happened. Well, don't just stand there. Very nice house, Mr. Bertin. It belongs to my wife. My sister-in-law must've said. You've seen her? Yes, yes, I've seen her, I had forgotten. - What? - I'd forgotten about the house. Come in. Very nice house. We'll tak here, if you don't mind. I like kitchens. Where are you going to live? In my house, - in my father's house. - No, I don't drink wine. - What'll you have, then? - Water. I have… Here you go. It's nice and cold. Oh, will you allow me? I love antique watches, and yours is beautiful. Oh, yes. It's nicer than mine. I'm not taking too much time? There's no hurry? No, no, I have plenty of time. Maybe I'm bothering you? Since I suppose you didn't come for no reason, go ahead with your questions. - Did you lose something? - It's my notebook, I… I'd like to check, then I wrote down… I wrote down a few things. I'd also like to see your wife's room, for example. I don't have the key. I do. Some things I don't forget. You seem surprised, Mr. Bertin. You didn't know she was losing her hair and had been wearing wigs? Wives are sometimes secretive… Out of modesty. Out of fear of ridicule. You see, Mr. Bertin, I've lived alone for a long time, but I was also married. And then… one day my wife left. Not quite under the same circumstances as yours, if I may say so, because I know who she left with and where she is. I didn't expect it. I still wonder why. Is the bathroom this way? She had a slight limp. In her left leg. And she made a point of wearing special shoes to hide it. But when she left, in such a hurry, she forgot a lot of things. But she took all her shoes with her. She didn't forget any. Not a single one. - Is that OK? - I should've brought my briefcase. I'll bring them back, of course. You can do whatever you want with them. Wanna light? Oh, no, no, no, I don't smoke. I don't smoke anymore. I used to smoke a lot, but… not now. Well, now, listen: my wife left. Why, I don't know. Where, I don't know. But I'd like you to know one thing right now: this situation is pretty good for me. Did your wife usually wear jewelry? She always wore jewelry. Try to remember: that night, in particular? That night, I didn't see her, Judge. My sister-in-law must've told you. Just like she must've told you I had a mistress. Muriel Olivier, the teacher. That's very good. I beg your pardon? I say: it's very good that there is still a school here; so many places have gotten rid of them! - You must be very attached. - I went to school there. I was referring to Miss Olivier. You must be very attached to her. I'm going to live with her. If that's what you want to know. Do you think… Mrs. Bertin might have run away? Françoise? No. No, but I do think she could be hiding somewhere just to get me in trouble. Do you really think she would do that? That kind of question is for you to answer, Judge. I'm afraid I've taken up too much of your time, Mr. Bertin. I'll come back and see you again, and it'll be my pleasure. Excuse me, but the priest is here. He's come for the candelabra. Apparently, Mrs. Bertin bought it for his church. Well, give it to him. I was thinking earlier that it was out of place in such a well-kept sitting-room. François went to the city and got it for me the day she… And she held on to it so she could ask you to clean it. Oh, I would have polished it, Father, if I had known. That's fine. Stéphane, you don't mind if I take it? - It's yours. - Thank you. - Still no word? - None at all. Let me introduce myself: Fernand Noblet, the examining magistrate. Father, I see you've got a car. Yes, yes… Would you mind taking me back into town? I'd be happy to. Goodbye, Élodie. See you soon, Stéphane. But I'll warn you, I drive slowly. It's OK, I'm not in a hurry. I'm never in a hurry. Goodbye. Thank you for the bag. Goodbye. Well, that man is brave! Going back with the priest! So, as he wanted his church to continue to have a priest… He gave me the 2CV. I didn't think Mr. Bertin was so religious. Oh, he couldn't really care less about God. But if the church tower's weathercock is leaning a little, he'll have it fixed right away. The church is part of his personal decor. And so am I. Yet he seems to have a lot of respect for you. Ah, yes, as a rugby referee, yes! And Mrs. Bertin? Between Stéphane and Françoise, there was… disagreement from the start. Then, each looked for a way of consoling themselves. Françoise, in her Christian faith. And my rascal Stéphane, in the women around here. To think he was my best altar boy… She must have bought it. - Mrs. Duverger didn't mention this. - Excuse me? The candelabra. Oh, yes, she found it at the secondhand store, in front of the bus stop. Yes, I see. - I even see… - What is it? - What? - The candelabra. It has hair on it. It deserves a good polishing! If you'll allow me, Father, I'll take care of it. Yes… Castelin. Foods and novelties, and mayor of the town. What's going on, Judge? We saw your courthouse pass in the car. - So, what was wrong with it? - Problem with the radiator. These things happen. - You don't have to. - Oh, yes, yes, yes. Mr. Mayor, you preside over the affairs of a lovely town. My congratulations. The surrounding countryside… is delightful. I'll certainly be back. Thank you. Goodbye. Perfect. No! - Hey! - We're trying it out. No! We don't have the time to. I like it when you put up a fight. Stop it, help me put my books away. - Did you read all this? - Yes, almost. Come on, give it back! Why do you keep them if you've read them? You'd do good to read some sometimes. Ah, there we go! You sound like my father! I'm sorry. Where is she? - What? Who? - Your wife. Where is she? - I don't know, I told you! - Does the judge believe you? I don't give a damn about him. I didn't want to bother you. So, I didn't tell you, but she came and saw me. And she said she'd never get divorced. So what? I just wonder what's going to happen. What'll happen is you'll move in here and we'll live together. But I liked things better before. Well, I prefer things now. Stop it! You've arrived after the battle, Mr. Bertin. Excuse me, I was a little late. Did Élodie open the house? She was very cooperative. Please thank her. Did you find what you were looking for? What makes you think I am? For something important. In a case like this, a search is… it's routine. But I wouldn't bother you for nothing, I have a summons here that I'd like you to come down for. I have some questions to ask you. But this time at my office, with my clerk. Something new? I'd rather not play around with you: traces of blood and hair were found on the candelabra that your wife brought back. Yes, but it's a little difficult for me because tomorrow is Friday, I have the workers' pay… Postponing this interview to Monday - would present a problem for me. - Why don't we go now? Just enough time to go by the tannery, sort out a few things, and then… If you want, you can come with me. No, I'd rather you left your car, we'll take mine… - it works. - Oh. Yes, it works today. Mind you, we could also take the paddy wagon! Might be fun, right? I don't doubt you find that funny. Captain, we'll go by the tannery. If you'll follow us, please, I'd like that. - Ever seen a tannery? - No. This will give you a chance to visit one. This is the drying room. We do vacuum and steam drying. Alban, I'll see you in my office. My grandfather founded... watch out. My grandfather founded the first tannery here in 1895. That's how the Bertins started. Before, we were farmers. Maurois, in my office, five minutes. Be careful, go ahead. Over there's tanning. They use almost exclusively mineral salts, chromium salts, or organic compounds. Like formalin or… Bonafon! Meeting! Something wrong? It's the smell. Only people not from the town can smell it! Here, we all smell of it! Even the women and children! Because it's a reassuring smell. Because the day when we don't smell it anymore, that'll be death. Let me introduce you to Investigating Judge Noblet. He's taking me in for questioning. By the way, I'm… a witness or a suspect? You are a witness, of course. I suppose that one can enter your office as a witness and leave as a suspect? It happens. I suppose it's even possible not to leave at all? That happens, too. Debray, do you think the firm can function without me? Even for a while? Certainly not. Even a little while. - And you, Maurois? - I've called you out on it enough. Vanille, - where are we with the backlog? - Work for three weeks. - And after that? - We've got the new deal with Air France. Will they sign without me? I don't think so, sir, and you have the contract with the Belgians, which'll be the same. Oh, yes, that's right. The Belgians. Listen, if you'll allow me, there's a good chance you'll be back this very evening. Can you guarantee that? No, I can't guarantee that. Fine. Therefore, I have decided to suspend the company's activities as soon as the current orders are completed. Debray, if I'm not back by Monday, you'll have layoff letters sent to the entire staff. Keep only a few guys for maintenance and security. Your rights will be respected, and you'll receive your customary compensation. As for the rest… I can't tell you yet. That's it. You can go back to work. I'm requesting a union meeting immediately. That's your right. See about it with Debray. Go find Demaison immediately. Let him know what's going on here. Tell him to call Varan. - The representative? - Yes, he'll find him at his newspaper. She's lovely. I see you don't play the game willingly, Mr. Bertin. Oh, is this a game? Sometimes, I'd like to be like you. Yes, yes, I envy you a little. You do exactly the opposite of what you'd expect a man to do in your situation. You charge right in. Your young assistant also seems to just go for it. Yes, not like you. You can smoke if you like, sir. Well, what's he doing? Oh, he'll come, don't worry. Please excuse me, I… Well, what's this story about blood on the candelabra? Mr. Bertin, you really don't like to be on the defensive. What do you think about it? The traces of blood and hair on the candelabra that your wife brought home the night she disappeared? I think that a candelabra sitting on a shelf could very well… fall on someone's head. And there you go. - That's interesting. - Yes. Yes, that's very interesting. That's one hypothesis among others. It's completely possible it happened the way you're saying. This candelabra is indeed heavy enough to hurt someone. Injure their head, in this case. Is that what happened to you? Forgive me but I must have left out that it's your hair and your blood, Mr. Bertin. I thought I'd told you, I… So, how did you manage to injure your head with this candelabra? From the examination of his head wound, his version is plausible. Indeed, he could have done it to himself 50 different ways. I'll settle for one way. The way it happened. Strange things happen to all of us every day, and they don't necessarily lead to a trial. What are you presuming? She hit him, he hit back and killed her? That'd be enough for me for a start. I'd have proof he saw her that night, contrary to what he claims. You would have even better proof if there was blood and hair from the woman on the candelabra. Well, if I had that… That would be very good. Thank you for your swiftness, Doctor. It's getting late. If you like, we can continue this conversation another day. No, I'd rather get it over with. Yes, your style. You don't switch tacks. You just go for it. If you want to call home… All right. So, this candelabra, which you've never seen at home, you put it on a shelf, from which it falls and injures your head, right? That's right. - And then after that? - After what? What did you do afterwards? I picked it up, and I might have said, "shit." Yes, that's what people usually say in such cases. And then? Then, I wiped the blood that I had - on my head off. - And you washed it? - What? - The candelabra, did you wash it? I, uh… I think so. You think so or you're sure? I… Wait… No, yes, I washed it. Yes, I'm sure, I washed it. I'm glad your memory is clearer now because, indeed, it was washed, the store owner confirmed this. I admit I was curious about this, it made me… But since… since you're telling me you did, I have no more questions about it. Yes. Except one. Why? Why "why"? Well, why did you wash it? I… I don't know, I must've done it automatically. You see blood on this candelabra, and although that's normal since you hurt yourself with it, you don't like leaving on it, so, just like that, automatically, you washed it, automatically, just like that. After everything! Can you document this version? For the time being. "That evening, I left the tannery around 8:00 p.m., having been held up by the installation of a new machine, and I went for a drink with four of my workers at Fréval café, which I left around 9:00 p.m. I went home, there was light in my wife's room, but I heard no noise and did not see her. I ate dinner alone in the kitchen as is my habit because I never eat with my wife." You're not gonna eat your…? If you'd like that… …because I never eat my meals with my wife… who usually goes up to her room very early, reads and turns off the light around 10:00 p.m. I left the mansion at about 10:10 p.m. without noticing if the light in her room…" - Yes? - Excuse me, but, uh… but I'm sure it was off. "…and went to Miss Olivier's house, where I spent the night." We'll leave it at that for tonight. Can't we continue? We're almost done. It's what? 9:45 p.m. Now, I don't have a car I can call to get me home. And I hate sleeping in hotels. For that, I can't provide you with a service car at this time. Is it OK if we continue in the morning, though? If you'd like. Well, then, what I suggest is that you go home, go to bed, and make me a little place here so I can get a little rest. The janitor must have… a cot for provincial clients? This way, I'll already be here. - Funny guy, huh, Judge? - Yeah. You still managed to throw him off a few times. You think so? Oh, you'll see that you'll get him in the end. If he doesn't wear me out first. Well, I'll leave the key inside, that way, you won't be disturbed. The bathroom is down the hall. - You need a wake-up call? - If you could just get me some coffee. - That's too much. - It's fine. Thank you. BERTIN TANNERY TO CLOSE 300 UNEMPLOYED, THE DEATH OF A TOWN ON THE HORIZON That's right, Commissioner. Goodbye, Commissioner. The Chief Justice is coming to see you, Mr. Prosecutor. I read it, I read it. But tell me… you were the one who advised me to put Noblet on this case. But who is this Noblet guy, really? There you go. "One must wonder about the professionalism of a prosecution prepared to jeopardize the entire local economy and community…" Bla, bla, bla… "…a respected company director…" Bla, bla, bla, bla… "… the same legal system that lets gangsters…" Yeah… Can you taste it enough? Have a good day, missy. You're convinced, but that's not your position, my dear Noblet. Leave that to the jury. You read it, I don't need to draw you a picture. And if this Bertin is your culprit, then present irrefutable evidence against him. Like the commissioner just said. The commissioner? What does he have to do with the investigation? Nothing, of course. Don't worry. Prepare the case, Noblet, prepare it. This is your case, and no one's taking it away from you. That goes without saying. We're confident in you. Yes… I get the sense that people here don't really want Mr. Bertin to be the murderer. There are obviously some culprits who are convenient and others who aren't. All right. Mr. Doyen, do you think that I can continue with - Mr. Bertin's deposition this morning? - Have you summoned him back? He slept at the courthouse. Here? But where? In the room next to my office. - That's very unusual. - He was very insistent. I understand why now. Now I understand… I'm afraid you've just been played, Noblet. In any case, I think it would be advisable for you to postpone this deposition. If Mr. Bertin goes home as soon as possible, it will at least calm things down. Yes, I understand. I particularly understand when you want to get rid of your wife, it's best to start by hiring staff. Did you have a good night, Judge? - Not bad. It's waking up that's… - Ah, thank you. Yes. Oh, well… - I've gotten here too late. - It's the intention that counts. Excuse me, I gave a little piece to Malvina. That's my cat. - We'll share it? - No. Did you read it? Yes. - And you? - I've even heard about it. So, no charges anymore? You're the one who put that in your own head! Why? - You gotta admit: you're disappointed. - Troubled. You know, Judge, - you may not have realized it, but… - But what? While you had your nose stuck in cases, trains passed by that you couldn't catch. An investigating judge at your age, in a small town like this… You couldn't go with the flow. Must've made a lot of mistakes. Who doesn't? - Got a light? - Yes. Excuse me, but… Goodbye, Mr. Bertin. I forgot my scarf. Goodbye, Judge. I see my paper had an effect. - Thanks, Varan. - It was nothing. Debray informed Demaison, Demaison alerted me, I got how we should play the game. Threatening to close - brilliant. Not a threat - if they keep hassling me, I will close. Well, we going or what? Stop that, don't mess around. Look at this, it's the return of the emperor after Elba. Cut the crap. You're back! - I've brought him back! - OK, don't overdo it. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, come on in! It's the boss's round! The boss's round let's not go crazy! Oh! - Aren't you coming? - No, some drinks I don't like. Hey, Stéphane, the boss's round, - not serious, are you? - Yes, I am. - Who's the boss here? It's not you. - Ah, I wish. Sylvie, what are you doing? Bring the bottles! My friends! I'd like to say something. Don't bother, Varan. Whoa! Only one person to convince here, and that's me. The rest'll follow. A drink, Representative? Very funny. You gave us quite a scare when we saw you being taken in like that. Don't worry, Mr. Mayor, that's over. No one's gonna make Stéphane Bertin jump through hoops - if he doesn't want to! - Yeah! Come on! You see, Demaison, still pays to be like this today. Hey! Where's its little sister? You seem afraid he'll take your seat in the House. You can rest easy. He's marked off his hunting ground once and for all. Where he's sure to reign supreme. Careful, Stéphane! Come on! Muriel. Muriel. Muriel… Muriel! Muriel! Muriel! Muriel! Muriel… Muriel… Muriel… I didn't know where you'd gone. That you'd gone off with him… With my son… Pierrot, can't you see straight? - Excuse me, miss. - Well, go on, but walk. Here, this is for you. You don't need to, Mr. Bertin. He was so pleased that you came. Take care of him, OK? You could've come with me. How is Pierre? He's done for. How's it going, Alban? Garden going well? Oh, it's growing in any case, Mr. Bertin. - Have a good Sunday. - Thank you, you too, Mr. Bertin. You see these houses? My father had them built when we expanded the factory. He brought in staff from elsewhere, they had to be housed, along with their families. Now, I rent them out for a pittance. They're happy. They don't wanna leave. Will you drop me off at the school? - Not coming to the stadium? - No, I have work to do for tomorrow. Why didn't you take it? You could've done it at home. I want some time alone. I can, right? Don't get mad. Wait, is it your condition? I haven't been pregnant with your kid for six months! Anyway, that's not the point. Oh, sorry, the cigar? I'm sorry. Go, go, go! On the wing! Ah! Shit, what is it now? I saw a punch! Don't know who did it, but next time, he's out. Don't spit on my grass, Maurois, you don't pay to maintain it. Your fault too, look, you think you can dress like that? - No arguing. - Neither here nor in the city. - Let's play, let's play. - A priest is a priest. He should dress like a priest. Otherwise, there's no more religion! Ah! Pass it! Yes! Go. Over there! Ah! Get back. Come on, get back. Over there. Yes! What's with you? What? Didn't you read out front? Café, hotel, restaurant. "Hotel," in black and white. How could I refuse him a room? Just tell him it was full. - And he would've believed me? - Two-faced. Anyway, I don't want any legal trouble. You know, in the town, Because of the circumstances, Stéphane is the law. Some days, I wonder if the Good Lord hasn't chosen to stay in the tannery rather than here. No one ever challenges his authority? At the tannery, of course, I sometimes disagree with him. On the town council as well. Could say he and I are often fighting. But that's as far as it goes. And Mrs. Bertin? She didn't really like the town people? From as much as she saw of us… She had no business judging us. And you townspeople didn't like her either, huh? To be honest, Gustave and I worked there, but it certainly wasn't for her. Was it for Mr. Bertin? We've known him since he was a kid. With him, how can I put it, it was… like we were always on the same team! And how was he with Mrs. Bertin? Oh, he put her through the wringer. No battering, though. But well, with her, you know… she couldn't really have worn a hat. Did she know about it? Of course. And without revealing secrets of the confessional, I think I can tell you that she suffered a lot. She was so proud, poor thing. She was? - That is… - And Miss Olivier? How long had you known her? When a new teacher arrives in the town, people take bets on how long he takes to get her into bed. Heard the ones before didn't make it past All Saints' Day. And I made it up to Christmas. That's a kind of record, don't you think? I must admit I don't know much about that. You understand, long term, if I hadn't given in, it would've been looked down upon by parents. Yeah, some would've lost their bets. And why aren't you asking me about his wife? You give such good answers when you're not asked a question. She always disregarded me. But she knew, of course. Then, one day, she decided to come see me. It was shortly before she disappeared, incidentally. What did she say to you? What a woman might say to another sleeping with her husband. Did she threaten you? No, she wasn't the type to. No, I think, deep down, she was just unhappy. Do you think, despite it all, she was still in love with her husband? He hadn't made love to her for a very long time. - You don't like my beef stew? - I do, but it doesn't like me. A little slice of ham would do for me. Ham, what a pity. - Already so bleak here. - Has something changed? You can't tell it's deserted here? It wasn't before? Hear that, Sylvie? Maybe I could eat in my room, so they wouldn't see me and maybe they'd come? Yeah. Trouble is, your room, as you say, is here, too. They're really angry with you? Yet, I ask you, Judge: if my wife had disappeared? - Hmm? - What are you saying? Don't worry about it, go get the ham! Stéphane, what can I get you? Give me a pack of cigarillos. You're lucky you're the only convenience store around. Listen, I'll get you a drink. It's on me! I swear… How's your appetite, Judge? What the hell are you two doing here? Why, got something against it? - Well, maybe we could take it home. - No, stay. Drinking with us, Stéphane? No, not tonight, Maurois. Thanks anyway. - Well, two glasses of hooch! - It's on me, guys! Should be able to drink when and where you want! He's not going to make the law here! Listen, I've often offered you a good price for your business. I'm sticking with it still. That's very kind of you, Larsac, but I'm not in jail yet. Frankly, I'm not counting on that to make a better deal. No, but prices would go down if I were in the hole. Of course. I'd be tempted to wait. But I'm honest. And I'm offering to do the deal immediately. The tannery is not only my capital. It's also the best protection I have. These days… if you offered me double, I wouldn't sell. I shoulda known you were bluffing. I'm not bluffing, Larsac. If I'm arrested, I'll close, but I won't sell. If you do that, you'll die a slow death. Guarantee it. I'll wait. Dead bodies've never scared me. Get out of here. You put too much faith in your lucky star. You might lose sight of it. For a while. In prison. What you here for, Debray? Maurois was asking me questions. - About what? - Everyone saw Larsac was in your office. So, what, you want me to sell? Hmm? You thinking that, in the end, it wouldn't be a bad idea. That way, "in case something happens to him", you'll keep your job. But this isn't about us. Oh, that's where you're wrong, because you're affected. You're all affected! What do you think? If I sell to Larsac, he'll liquidate a third of you tomorrow. He'll increase production. On top of that, he'll kick you out of the houses I rent you. - To sell them to tourists! - Don't listen to him! He's just trying to use us to solve his problems. How many of you think like Maurois? Don't respond, he's trying - to provoke you! - Go ahead, show yourselves. We're a minority, if that's what you want to know. But maybe that'll change. - Everyone won't follow you forever. - We'll see about that. For now, go home, it's over. Go, go, go home. Go, go. Go, go, go! Get out of here. I had nothing to do with it, I assure you. Yeah, it's OK. Mr. Bertin. I wanted to tell you… …regarding Maurois, a case of professional misconduct can always be arranged. Don't touch Maurois, Bonafon. He's my union rep. I don't want another one. A pain in the ass, but at least I know all his stupid tricks. Been going at it since grade school So, don't interfere, is that clear? Yes, Mr. Bertin. - What is it, Vanille? - Lapierre is dead. OUR DEAR BROTHER BERTIN TANNERY This threat to close the tannery - you must've realized it scares the town. And that guy, the judge, he might not always fall for it. He will as long as you all around me hold out. And you especially. If you wanna stay mayor, Mr. Mayor. I've known Lapierre forever. When I started at the tannery, he was already there. He taught me the trade, he was… he was a good worker. He was also a good man. He was one of us. He was born here. He lived here, he worked here, in this town, in our town. Just like us. Like us who want to continue working here. Living here. Raising our children here. And when the day comes, buried here. Just like him. It sounds simple. Seems that bothers some people. People who want this town dead like Chevry or Saint-Jean. And that won't happen. If we all stand together. If we stick together. That's all I have to say. And that's what he would've said if he was still with us. Let us pray… Miss Olivier… I'm fine, thank you, please let me go. - Are you… - No, thank you, really. …and joy with those you call into your kingdom. - Muriel! - She was just a little weak. Don't worry, it wasn't serious. Just a little faint. The emotion, no doubt. In her condition, it's normal. Can you fix my car? I'm closed. For the burial. Wha... what are you doing? We're in the Middle Ages. I'm asking for asylum, Father. Where have you been? Looking for you an hour. Why did you leave like that? How long you gonna keep thinking we belong to you, even in death? How far you think you can go? I'm taking you back. And you stop smoking. The judge knows I'm pregnant. That doesn't matter. He lacked a motive to charge you, now he has it. No proof. He can't do anything. Yes, but I can. I have decided to leave you and have an abortion. Never! You will never do such a thing! Never! Why did you kill her? Because of the baby? Where is he? What are you doing in that hole? You know where this can lead? Yeah, to court. In my case, nobody'll believe it was an accident. No one, that's right. I thought you were a pig. A boar, if you prefer. I prefer neither. An old loner in the area, been chasing him for several days. Must be about 200 or 300 pounds. Yeah, well, I don't weigh that much. You're not a very good shot. Funny suit for hunting. - I don't understand you. - What don't you understand? I don't file charges of obstruction of an investigating judge? That's what it's called. I'm not interested in that. As a principle. Nor as a tactic. - Why are you hounding me? - I'm not hounding anyone. I wanna find your wife, and I will. Rest assured, I will find her. Oh, what a mess! I had it all planned out. And now this is when you're choosing to leave. As soon as my replacement is here. - Does Stéphane know? - Oh, yes, he knows. But he doesn't believe it yet. - So? - At the pond, they're starting, Judge. Who's that over there? That's Gaspard. This pig throws stones at us when we go by. Sometimes, we'd like to get him out of our way. Why don't you do it? It's difficult, Mr. Bertin likes him, he pays his fines. Let go! Come on! Let go! - Let go! - What the hell are you doing here? Let go! Call your dog! Let him have it if you don't want him to bite you. Call your dog! - Tell him to let go! - Let him play with it! Call him! What the hell do you care about that! You killed my dog! You'll pay for this! They killed my dog! You bastards! You bastards… They killed my dog. Just a minute, sir. You could've avoided shooting the dog. He was keeping us away. The ambulance left with the body. I want an immediate autopsy. I'll call the coroner. Excuse me, sir. Well, Noblet, you finally have your body! And a good suspect at the same time. A suspect who no one has a problem about. - The way you like them, sir. - But, the wig, Noblet, you found it at his place. What explanation is he giving? No explanation. He's not even defending himself, not a word. Like a wall. He just hurls insults. The name-calling will not help him at trial. Especially if he has an unfortunate track record. In this case, maybe you mean "fortunate"? You're arresting him, otherwise, what's this? What else do you want? Yes, I'm arresting him, even as - you wouldn't understand this, so… - I'm counting on you. - Where is Stéphane? - In the city. Yeah, not today. - Well! - Leave it! You don't want to say anything? Don't know anything? What I know is you bastards killed my dog! They killed my dog! And now? We take him in? No, not yet, I want someone to see him first. Say, Judge, are you going to arrest Gaspard? - Yes. Any reason I shouldn't? - Why you shouldn't? - Of course not. - I thought not. This is what you wanted. That I arrest Gaspard for the murder of Françoise Bertin! Because you're sure he did it! So, don't give me that look! You should be happy! Happy and relieved! You'll be able to sleep well! You can work and think about your future! Gaspard, a culprit like him doesn't come along every day! Did he confess? - Does it matter? - Oh, yeah, it does. We've known Gaspard forever. So, poaching, stealing chickens, rabbits - he's capable of that. - But everything else… - Then who? Hmm? Of course, that's for me to find out. Who? - Have you been in the town? - No. I have two pieces of news for you. One good, one bad. Which should I start with? Start with the bad news. Your wife was found, dead, of course. Buried in a quarry, no personal items, no jewelry. My condolences, Mr. Bertin. Now the good news. We arrested the culprit. The number one suspect. Gaspard escaped. Gaspard? Don't shoot! We saw him going up through the fields. We pursued, but he had a head start. He got to the cabin before us. How many bullets do you think he has? Enough to sustain a siege. I gave him that rifle a few years ago, never used it. Well, changed his mind. Let me go alone. He won't shoot at me. It's not your life I fear for, Mr. Bertin - it's his. Damn it, you got him into this mess! Maybe. But I'm warning you: you go near the cabin, I'll have you shot. You know what'll happen? He'll shoot your officers until his last bullet. And that one'll be for him. That what you want? OK, we'll go. But I'll go with you and I'll do the talking. You see that window over there? Don't shoot! Easy, Gaspard, don't shoot, it's me! You're lucky my reflexes are gone! Otherwise, you'd have a bullet in ya! Those bastards killed my dog! But can't shoot them. Dammit, what do you need? He hadn't done anything! If you came to tell me shit like this, wasn't worth it. - I came to stop you from doing it! - Yeah, I'd like to know how. The judge arrested you by mistake. Oh, I know it's a mistake. Since you were the one who killed your wife. I'm cross-eyed, but from a distance, I still see. I recognized your car. Then I saw you burying her in the quarry. - Where is he? - With the old man in the shed. Oh, boy. Let me go. Damn it! Bastard… Why didn't you tell them? Who do you think I am, anyway? That's not what we do around here. You don't feel like talking, do you? Might do you good to. I had just told her the girl was pregnant. I told her she could do what she wanted, get a divorce or… That wouldn't stop me from recognizing the kid. She went nuts. She picked up a candelabra, she hit me, I tried to take it away from her, we got into a fight, I hit her hard. She fell. - She was dead. - And so? Why didn't you go to the police and explain that to them? You think they would've believed me! The problem is, they won't believe you now. You better keep your mouth shut. Yeah, I know. Another one must have shit his pants. I'll get one of those bastards eventually. Stop it, Gaspard. You're the one who's gonna get screwed. Meantime, gonna have myself a nice fireworks display. I've always dreamed of ending on a high note. Hey, would work out for you if it ended like that, huh? You know, at my age, I don't give a damn. Go on, leave me here. You can just go. Ah! Just knocked out, Judge. - And now? - What about now? You'll see. Indicted and sent to prison this morning by investigating judge Noblet, industrialist Stéphane Bertin continues to fiercely deny wrongdoing. The evidence is said to have shown blood found under the nails of the victim to be that of Mr. Bertin. A dispute between expert witnesses is expected, said the lawyer for the accused, who has also filed a request for bail for his client. Bertin, as he had announced, has decided to close his company, thus laying off more than 200 people. BERTIN INDUSTRIAL TANNERY The to... the tannery closing is the end of the town. No, cut. This is not right. You're not being natural, try to be. Forget us. It's not hard. - Yeah… - OK, again. - How's the sound? - Fine. Tannery closing, 11, take two. - The tanner... - Hey, where'd you put the tile? Cut! We apologize. I know we can get the running again. And that we can run it ourselves. Besides, there are others who have done it before us. So, why can't we do it here? I have a wife and kids, I have to work. So, I don't want to go anywhere else. For me, the tannery has got to reopen. That's why I joined the committee for Mr. Bertin's release. In other words, is his potential guilt secondary to you? No formal evidence can be seriously held against my client. The results of our independent exam of the blood found on the victim have refuted the claims made by the prosecution. The tannery must reopen. We'll all come here if we have to to get Mr. Bertin released. In your opinion, Mr. Mayor, is he guilty or innocent? Innocent. Innocent, I'm sure of it. I'm not going to fight for Stéphane Bertin. Not saying he was a bad boss, no, that's not what this is. I'm saying even a boss should be - tried the same. - Expecting anyone? No, hope it's not a journalist. I found work elsewhere. Then, at least this way, I can't be used. Reporters interviewed Mr. Demaison… Ah, it's you. Can I come in, if you don't mind? …unfairly pursuing Stéphane Bertin… My colleague, Nadine. This is Mr. Noblet, the investigating judge. …than soundly applying the rules of justice. This is why if tomorrow my client is once again refused bail, we would have reason to question the real independence of the justice system, - especially certain magistrates. - Don't worry. If it's for me, it's OK. - Recently, I've heard quite a lot of this. - But my sister wouldn't listen to me. She couldn't bring herself to leave this man. And now, he... Now, it's a matter for the courts. I have just refused bail. But if you want to visit him, I can get you an authorization. You don't want to see him anymore? It's not that, but… not now. Not right now, anyway. He's asked about you. He's worried about… You can reassure him. If you change your mind, just call me. I won't bother you any longer. Goodbye, Miss Olivier. I'll show myself out. Goodbye. Of course, I'll let him know. My respects, sir. Of course, I could've guessed it. The Ministry of Justice feels there's no need to refer the case for indictment. But it's still your case, Noblet. It's only an opinion, a firm one, but an opinion. We only hope that you share it, in good conscience of course. I consciously stand by my referral of the case for indictment. Your case hinges on a disagreement among experts that five months of investigation failed to resolve. What do you want to go to trial on? On the case itself. I find it quite solid. Your refusal to budge on this goes against the principle of solidarity that's supposed to exist here. If I gave in, something more important would be flouted, Sir. You realize you are forcing me to inform Paris? One last time, Noblet - think of your career! My career! At my age! Missing trains to miss trains, as long as the last one's worth it, gentlemen. Isn't that right? Free Bertin! Free Bertin! Free Bertin! Free Bertin! He looks good for eight days old. - What's his name? - Julien. Well, my name is Fernand. I had some trouble getting used to it. You don't mind if… Anyway, I roll them but don't smoke them. Hello? Oh, yes, hold on. It's for you. Excuse me, I took the liberty of saying I was here. In case of an emergency. Hello, Javel? Hmm… Thanks, Javel. Charges dismissed. He'll be released this evening. Well, I'm leaving. Nothing more to do here. He will certainly come to see you. You see, there was enough in this case to send any other man to trial, except him. Good luck to you. Starting Monday, the tannery will open again! Yeah! - Take me to the hospital, quick. - You'll see your son later! Hey! - Mr. Bertin? - Yes, that's me. Miss Olivier asked me to give you this letter. Why? I wanna see her. But sir, she's not here anymore. She left earlier with her son. Left? Where did she go? All I know is she wanted to catch her train as soon as possible. The six o'clock, I think. Come on. Which train? Did you read it? She'll never let him have your last name. If she went to New Caledonia, she wants to be as far from you as possible. - Leave me alone, OK? - Well, think about it! Stéphane! Wait! I think you would have kept him. He would've waited for you both. If you had been tried, at least. Yes, if you went on trial, you still had a chance.
