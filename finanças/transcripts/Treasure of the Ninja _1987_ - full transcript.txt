[Narrator] Our story begins here, a small island off the coast of Florida. This guy owns the island. His name, Stephen Chase. And this guy is his buddy El Kazi. Now, these two share a very special relationship because, you see, Chase does more than just own an island. He's a ruthless killer. And El Kazi, well, he's a ninja, and if you don't believe in ninja, well, I've got one hell of a story for you. My name, Magneta Faze. It's my job to keep these two guys from doing harm to Dr. Melissa Stewart. And she's going on a very special treasure hunt. That's what our story is all about. (screams) Dr. Stewart, what's wrong? [Melissa] Robert, we got it! - Really? - Yes, we are going after the treasure! - Kamchia- Shh, there's just one catch. We can't tell anyone about it. Why, it's just a treasure hunt. Not just any treasure hunt. The government has classified it as top secret. Only you, me, and our eight colleagues know about it. Still ask why. Robert, I guess I don't have to tell you that our government is a very peculiar operation. No kidding. It's pretty simple, if we find the treasure, the government wants full credit for supporting us. If we don't- They keep it quiet so no one knows that we were involved at all. Now you've got the picture. Well, come on, Robert, we've got to arrange a flight to Ranga. (fluttering music) Oh, my God, Steven Chase. What you doing here? How's the archeology business? We know you're still upset at the entire Institute, but your practices were unethical. We had to expel you. I realize that, Doctor, and I want to personally thank you, Dr. Richards, for teaching me a good lesson, one that I'll never forget. Cut the bullshit. Watch your mouth, punk. One of your hired killers, Chase? We know about your so-called ninja squad. Glad to see you're so interested in my welfare after destroying my professional career. Okay, that's enough! Let's go, Robert. Mr. Chase hasn't finished yet. Well, now that you have our undivided attention, speak your piece. So, I hear you're heading to Ranga. Mind telling me about it? I have no idea what you're talking about. I think you do. Come on, Melissa, I think this conversation just ended. I don't think you understand. You're not leaving until Mr. Chase is finished. [Robert] Get the hell outta my way. Hold it. Now, very slowly, place it back in your jacket or you won't have a hand to do it with. Now, get out of the way. (fluttering music) Tough little bitch, ain't she? Cool it, El Kazi, that woman is a class act. She's just got her priorities in the wrong place. Well, what now? We're going to Ranga. I should've known. They may have gotten me booted out of the archeology profession, but they won't stop me from getting this treasure. Let's go.

It's not okay. What is Steven Chase doing here? We don't know, Melissa. After we expelled him, he became a recluse. I know the story of Steven Chase, Dr. Lang, believe me. What I mean is we thought that he had forgotten all about us. He hasn't forgotten about us. That's why he's here. The important question is how he found out. The project hasn't even gotten off the ground yet. Dr. Taylor, there are any one of a number of ways he could've found out. Government bureaucracy, bad filing, tapped phone, even an informant on the inside. Dr. Lang and I are in complete agreement, Steven Chase represents no real threat. No real threat? That's what the US said about Hitler before he got going! - Now, Melissa, there's no need to get so- - Do either of you actually believe he's forgiven us for wrecking his career? [Dr. Lang] Well, Chase is a multimillionaire-millionaire. He doesn't care about our institution. We forced this man into seclusion! He became a millionaire out of necessity. That's right, necessity! He craved adventure and the high life. We killed this man of adventure by stripping him of his position. This man became a millionaire by selling archeological finds for a profit. I'm not denying that. Of course he was wrong! Okay, Melissa, if you feel it's too dangerous, we'll ask the government to call it off. No, I worked too long and too hard for this. Well, Melissa, what do you want us to do? We're only simple university doctors. If you don't find daily updates from RB-1, send help. Why don't we ask the government for help? There's gotta be somebody available. Excuse my French, gentlemen, but screw the government. [Faze Voiceover] Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away, I was busy with some very important business of my own, proposing a non-caffeine, non-alcoholic toast with my sweetheart Marla Mason. What I'm wondering is do Magneta Faze and Marla Mason mix? Without a doubt, unquestionably, yes. You sound pretty sure. I think you realize by now, I love you. In fact, I brought something along to prove it. Magneta, it's beautiful. It's not as beautiful as you, Marla. I want you to wear it. Say you'll be Mrs. Magneta Faze. (soft electronic music) Without a doubt, absolutely yes, I'll be Mrs. Magneta Faze. Mr. Faze, call from Washington. Okay, be right back. (soft electronic music) Bad news. I'm sorry, I gotta leave tonight. Another mission? You spend more time with that child. Look, Marla, she's my partner. Yeah, she's only 14, but she's a genius. She's like a daughter to me, don't you understand? I know the whole sad story. It's just that I don't wanna lose you to Monique, the government, or anyone else! You won't lose me, you got to understand- [Marla] I understand, I understand that I come second to everything else in your life. I have no choice. Magneta, I have no choice, either. Tell Monique, the Commander, and everyone else I said thanks. [Faze Voiceover] Rule number one in romantic encounters, never interrupt the dinner with a phone call. Guess I blew that, huh? Anyway, the call was from the Commander. He was in Washington. He said he had some tests for me. I didn't really know what to expect, but as a Zen philosopher once said, don't ever expect anything 'cause you'll always get something different. (skittering electronic music) Good morning, Miss Franklin. Good morning, Commander. Lieutenant Louis, is he here yet? He sure is. Magneta is always on time, although I don't think his mind is totally focused on this test. [Miss Franklin] Another fight with Marla? [Commander] You got it, kid. (skittering electronic music) How do you think he'll do? He's the best I've seen. This test will prove it. Is the ninja ready? - Yes, sir. I guess you're ready to start then. - Yes. - Is this as dangerous as it seems? - His opponent is a real ninja, this is no game. I guess there's no other way. Not for this mission. (soft electronic music) [Lieutenant Louis] They're ready. (whooshing) (thudding) That's one for Magneta. (whooshing) (grunting) (percussive electronic music) (thudding) (grunting) [Faze] And so I passed the commander's test, but what the commander failed to tell me was I was actually fighting a real ninja. I figured it was some tough local karate expert in black pajamas. Hey, what did I know? But I soon found out the test was for a reason, because my martial arts skills would become necessary very soon. Yo, Commander Niblo. - Morning. Some test, huh? [Faze] Yeah, you're not kidding. Gave me nightmares, yeesh, ninjas and all. But I'm not sure why we're being assigned to a treasure hunt. It's a sticky situation. That's why you and Miss Franklin are on the mission. It must be sticky. A treasure so secret only a handful of people know anything about it. The government stands to gain or lose a lot of prestige. We can't send the marines to Ranga. This is supposed to be a simple archeological expedition. Right, but I gather it's not just another archeological expedition, so what is it, and why all the fuss? The treasure of Kamchia is one of the last great mysteries in the archeological world. The trouble started when Steven Chase entered the picture. What's so special about him? He lives on an island guarded by his own ninja force. Ninja, huh? Now I see why I got this mission. Miss Franklin, gentlemen. - Hi, Commander. - Hi. Mr. Faze, I found it. [Faze] Where was it? [Miss Franklin] Under the floor mat in the back. What is it? The Blue Sleeve Memorial issue. I looked under that mat, I think. Not well enough, apparently. I can swear- - He'll be okay. - I know he will. I have confidence in you both. Have a seat. [Miss Franklin] Don't worry, Magneta can find lost treasures. But not lost magazines. [Faze] Hey, that's good, Lieutenant, yeah, that's real good. Monitor the staff at the Institute. Don't get too close, but don't let anything happen to them, either. [Faze] Okay, got it, let's go, Monique. [Commander] Oh, don't forget this. - Wow. - Keep me informed, good luck. Thanks. See you later. It's amazing, a teenage genius and a kung fu expert. Doesn't seem possible they could be so good. But they are. What about the expedition, shouldn't we send someone with them? We can't get too involved unless there's real trouble. Anyway, if there's real trouble, we'll hear from Captain Lee. Let's hope we don't hear about it too late. Amen, Lieutenant, amen. A penny for your thoughts. [Melissa] Hmm? Are you still upset with Dr. Lang and Dr. Taylor? Robert, they act like I don't know what I'm talking about. Steven Chase is going to get even. Why else would he be here? You're beginning to get worked up over nothing. And you're beginning to sound like Dr. Lang. Melissa, if Chase shows up, we'll handle it. How? Well, I don't know, but we'll think of something. [Announcer] Pacific Airline, Flight 10, now boarding. All passengers, please report to gate five. [Faze Voiceover] You can bet your bottom dollar that Chase wasn't too far behind, and, along with him, was an old acquaintance of mine, Karada, kung fu assassin, also on the government's Most Wanted list. What do you want me to do, Mr. Chase? Keep an eye on them. If they go into the tunnel before I get there, make sure nobody follows them. Don't worry, my men are waiting for me back in the jungle. You and your killing team have never failed. Don't fail this time. I'll be on the next flight out. Okay. [Announcer] After your 12 hour flight from the States, welcome to Ranga the South Pacific tropical paradise. Cool your heels in our huy-huy stag bar and jam to the rhythms of the Marge Sail Reggae trio. 12 hours. 12 hours on a plane. 12 hours on a plane in the air to get here. It's okay, Melissa. No, it's not. Robert, quick, get over here! Robert, we're being followed. Who is it, Melissa? I could've sworn, Robert, didn't you see a man in a brown leather jacket board the plane? I saw 100 other people do the same thing. No, Robert, you don't understand! There was something about him. He was watching us, closely. Too closely. Well, he's not there now. He's here somewhere. (gasps) Excuse me, Dr. Stewart? Who are you? I'm Captain Lee from Ranger Base One. Oh, Captain Lee, thank God! This is Dr. Richards. - Good to meet you. - Good to meet you. This is Corporal Taggart. - How you doing? Captain, I think we're being followed. Oh, by who? A man in a brown leather jacket. Taggert, have a look around. That won't be necessary. I think we better just get to the base. You sure? She's just a little jumpy. You bet I am. Okay, let's go then. He's here, somewhere. [Robert] Come on, Melissa, let's go. [Faze Voiceover] The next morning, Dr. Stewart, Dr. Richards, their assistants Joe and Michelle, and their guide Kango, began their search for the treasure. If they knew what was gonna happen later that day, they probably would've stayed at home. Dr. Stewart was indeed right. Carrado was following them, lurking in the bushes, waiting for his chance to strike. This way, over here. Take a look, Robert. [Faze Voiceover] To add to Dr. Stewart's problems, Steven Chase had taken his own private Lear jet to Ranga, and arrived in Ranga only minutes after their plane touched down. They were really in trouble now. (fluttering music) Melissa, I think you better look at this. Robert, this must be the Banga Lake. And, if my guess is right, we're on the right track. Let's move out. [Robert] Where is everybody? Good question. I don't like this. Let's go find them. Kango, stay here, we'll be right back. (fluttering music) (panting) (Kango shouts) (ninja grunts) (fluttering music) (thudding) (Kango shouts) [Kango] Dr. Stewart, Dr. Stewart! (pants) Uh oh. Dr. Stewart! (guns bang) (fluttering music) (gun bangs) Oh, boy, ninjas. Chase is here. Come on, Robert, let's get Kango and get outta here! (fluttering music) Look, it's Joe. Joe! He's dead! (fluttering music) (Robert groans) (gun bangs) Robert, are you okay? - Yeah. Thank you. Let's get outta here. (panting) [Kango] Dr. Stewart! (fluttering music) Dr. Stewart, help! (panting) (Kango groans) (fluttering music) I can't go anymore. Robert, Chase has gone nuts. We've gotta find Michelle and Kango. I just found Kango. That murdering bastard! (fluttering music) Drop your guns or you're both dead. (fluttering music) Okay, now, very slowly, up on your feet. (fluttering music) Let's go. Damn, no word form Melissa. This isn't looking too good. What do you think? I think we oughta do what Melissa said, get help. Who should we go to? We know the government's out of the question. Private detective? Private detectives. What private detective? [Dr. Taylor] Listen to this, I found something. Yeah? "Jackson and Trammel. "We're not angels but we send the crooks straight to hell." How do you like that? Now let me get this straight. You want us to go to a jungle to protect two scientists form ninjas? I've never heard of anything like this before. Have you, Sheebah? Nope, never in my whole life, but it sounds interesting, huh? Miss Jackson, I know this sounds weird. I have trouble believing it myself. But we need your help. Okay, okay, so you haven't heard from Professor Stewart in two days. Is that considered strange? Definitely, she radios daily. But the RB-1 usually relays the message. RB-1, or Ranger Base One, is our contact with Professor Stewart. There's been no word since her last message. Professor Lang and I are two of the few people who know anything about this, besides the government, of course. They think we are being too anxious, but there's one reason we know there's trouble. This Steven Chase you were telling us about earlier. (phone rings) - Got it, Mavis. Who's with Dr. Stewart? Two aids and Robert Richards, the man that got Chase fired. Now, unfortunately, that makes it doubly bad for Richards. You know what I'm talking about? [Mavis] I'm sure Chase is just delighted. An anonymous caller says your wife's been kidnapped, Dr. Taylor. [Dr. Taylor] What! (soft electronic music) Okay, the call said you're supposed to go in alone. You just do that and we'll take care of everything else. (pulsing electronic music) Well, howdy, Doctor. Who are you, where's my wife? I'm a friend of Steven Chase. Johnny Mantell's the name. Your wife's not here, I lied. What do you want? You fucked up bad, and now you gotta pay, so pay up, Doc. Well, look, I- (shouting) Hey, what the hell's going on? [Thug] We caught these cops outside. I said no cops. You just screwed yourself bad. Let's waste these suckers. [Thug] Hey, there's a kid up there. Grab the runt, we don't need no witnesses. (funky electronic music) (gun bangs) (funky electronic music) Wait, let them go. Okay, get moving, and I mean now. (funky electronic music) (gun bangs) (grunting) (funky electronic music) Who are you, anyway? Johnny Mantell. The most ruthless hitman in the history of the Southwest. Well, now that you know, you can die without any questions. Move it! (quiet music) (pulsing synth music) What is this shit, a fucking dart? (pulsing synth music) Boy, are we glad to see you. Who are you? [Faze] I'm a government agent. Look, protect the doc, I'll be back. ♪ Rumor has it you've been hanging out ♪ (thudding) [Johnny] Who the hell are you? You might call me Santa's helper. [Johnny] Very funny. ♪ You find out ♪ So, Mr. Faze, you and the kid, I mean Miss Franklin, both work for the government? Right, we had a hunch Chase would be sending his flunkies in. It's all related to the treasure of Kamchia. Chase is trying to knock off anybody who might interfere, except Dr. Stewart and Dr. Richards. Well, in that case, everyone else is under protective custody? Yeah, except two people, Dr. Geevas and Dr. Peters. So who do we go after? Dr. Geevas, here's a picture. She's at a convention downtown at the Hyatt. What about you two? Well, we're off to New York. And our plane leaves in one hour. We better get going. [Sheebah] Hold on just a second. Why do you guys get to go to New York? One, I was born there and I know my way around. [Sheebah] Come on! Well, look, would anybody but a native New Yorker wear this ever-changing hairstyle? I think he's got a point. Yeah, have a good flight. (soft electronic music) [Faze Voiceover] Now, next to Dr. Stewart and Dr. Richards, Dr. Geevas knew more about Kamchia than any other person in the world, which was good, but it was also bad, because it meant that El Kazi would definitely be making an attempt on her life. (soft electronic music) - Look around. - Why don't we just page her? No, that'll make her a very easy target. (soft electronic music) (fluttering music) [El Kazi] You know where Dr. Geevas parked? - Mm hmm. - All right, you rig the bomb, and you make the call. What if she gets away? You're both dead, now move. (fluttering music) (soft electronic music) [Announcer] Dr. Geevas, please report to the white courtesy phone, Dr. Geevas. I told her not to do that! She tells me not to do that and then she does it. Hello, Dr. Geevas. Yes, Chase? The treasure, okay, thank you! (fluttering music) [Faze Voiceover] When Mavis and Sheebah realized neither of them had paged Dr. Geevas, they knew every second counted, and that someone would be making an attempt on Dr. Geevas' life at any minute. (fluttering music) - Dr. Geevas. - Yes. I'm Mavis Jackson. This is my partner Sheebah Trammel. [Dr. Geevas] You're with the FBI? No, Dr. Taylor and Dr. Lang hired us. Hired you for what? To make a long story short, Steven Chase is trying to kill off you and some of your colleagues. That's what the man on the phone told me. He said he was from the FBI. Well, everything he said was true, except one thing. What's that? He was no FBI man. Well, looks like it was a false alarm. Come on, Doctor, we'll walk you to your car. Our address is on the card. Dr. Taylor and Dr. Lang are waiting for you. We'll be there as soon as we check this place out. All right, thank you. Wait a minute, Doctor. What's wrong? Which car is yours? That one. Sheebah, what are you doing? Sheebah! (fluttering music) Just like I thought, it was rigged. Rigged, for what? - A bomb. - Bomb? - It's a nasty one. - Must be absolutely nuts. I'll call the bomb squad. Doctor, I think you better come along with us. [Dr. Geevas] I think that's a very good idea. (fluttering music) Fucked up, they found the bomb. What now? (fluttering music) (clattering) My idea of a good time in New York City is hanging out at the Latin Quarter or just hanging out in the streets and watching kids break dance, just listening to some good music, maybe even going to a restaurant and getting a bite to eat. Definitely not hunting ninja. But that was the mission, and it had to be accomplished. The mission was twofold. Basically, we knew El Kazi was still in the United States. We had to stop El Kazi from killing Dr. Peters. Secondly, we had to try to bait El Kazi into the open and try to capture him, as well. This is what I and Monique were faced with when we arrived in New York City. (soft music) (phone rings) Hello, Sal's bakery. Oh, Monique, yeah, you knew it was me, huh? Brooklyn accent couldn't fool you, right, right. All right, listen, what about Dr. Peters? Uh huh, okay, where's the meeting? World Trade Center, okay, that's good. Listen, listen, there's no sign of El Kazi, but he's bound to show up. Get changed and meet me at the World Trade Center in about an hour, you got it? All right, I'll see you later. Be careful, kid. (bright pop music) Yo. Sure is good to be home. Too bad we can't stay. Agreed. Well, we haven't got any more time for sightseeing. I'll look for the doctor in the World Trade Center. You know what you gotta do out front. Right, real fresh breaking show. Okay, go round up your crews and I'll see you in about an hour. Okay, see you later. Yo, what's up? - Yo, how you been, Monique? Just fine, Chili Fresh. Listen, I need some back up. All right, where? Well, we're gonna put on a fresh breaking show for some friends. Sounds chill, let's rock. ♪ Yo, man ♪ ♪ In the beginning, the rock was something like this, man ♪ ♪ Rock the house ♪ ♪ Let's rock it ♪ ♪ Rock the house ♪ ♪ Let's rock it ♪ ♪ Rock the house ♪ ♪ Let's rock it ♪ ♪ Rock the house ♪ ♪ Let's rock it ♪ ♪ Rock the house ♪ [Faze Voiceover] Just like a bad penny, El Kazi showed up again with his cronies. Dr. Peters. [Dr. Peters] Yah, what is it? We're with the US Intelligence Agency. - I don't understand. - We have information that Steven Chase will make an attempt on your life. Chase? The treasure! I've got to get to a phone immediately! Of course, we'll take you, sir. (bright electronic music) ♪ Rock the house ♪ ♪ Let's rock it ♪ ♪ Rock the house ♪ Keep an eye out. ♪ Let's rock it ♪ What happened to your men? Good question. You don't think the killers could've gotten them? No, I don't think so. Let's go make that call. Well, Doctor, it's time. - Where's the phone? What is this, what are you doing? Stay back, stay away from me! (thudding) Doc, get back to your hotel. Okay, this is a crazy city! Who the hell are you? Magneta Faze, and I suppose you're El Kazi, Chase's top ninja, right? Good, you can die with that question! (grunting) (panting) (fluttering music) (grunting) (groaning) Damn! Damn, man. Hey, damn straight. I ain't had my lunch. - El Kazi probably took the shit, left New York, and left us here. - Shit, man. - Fuck this, man. - I want my money! I want something fucking to eat. Fuck me. - Tell me about it. Yo, fuck this. - Excuse me. You gentlemen looking for El Kazi? Yo, man, what the fuck you know about it? You fucking with us? You don't fuck with me. - Wait a minute, don't wrinkle the clothes, come on. All right, where's El Kazi. - I don't know. - Oh, man, we got to fuck you up then, you fucking with us. (moaning) (groaning) (exciting music) (grunting) - All right, Monique. - Oh, thanks, Chili! - Yeah, you take it easy. - Okay, bye, guys. All right, baby, later, see you. Bye bye. Monique, damn it, El Kazi got away. What do we do now? Well, we get outta New York, that's for sure. I thought you liked coming home. Well, not if I have to get beat on. - Hmm, I see your point. - Let's go. So we were off to the hotel to make sure Dr. Peters was all right, but we had failed to capture El Kazi. At that same moment, Chase was arranging things quiet nicely in the jungle. He had over 100 men there. Stewart and Richards weren't going anywhere. Where's El Kazi? [Man In White] He had trouble back in the States. What kind of trouble? [Man In White] Those people you wanted dead are under government protection. What happened? [Man In White] A government agent named Magneta Faze busted up El Kazi's hit, and he's got help. [Steven] What about Mantell? [Man In White] He got arrested by Faze and his buddies. Aw, goddamn! An idiot could figure out your plan, Chase. Melissa told Dr. Taylor and Dr. Lang to get help if we fail to radio in. It's all over, Chase. [Steven] Shut up, Richards! You forget I have your ass! Stop it, Steven! All right, where's El Kazi now? [Man In White] He'll be on the next flight here. Tell him, before he leaves the States, to kill that Magneta Faze and his helpers. [Man In White] Yes, sir. (birds cry) Think it over, Chase. It'll only get the government more suspicious. By the time they get suspicious, we'll be long gone. Still have to find the treasure, Chase. Right, so I suggest we get started. Damn it, Steven, stop being a fool! (fleshy smacks) Don't ever talk to me like that again. (fluttering music) Okay, she's got to be able to go. [Mavis] No, it's out of the question. She's got to, she's got to go. - I don't see why not. Why not? - Hello? - It's far too dangerous. - World War III just started- It's far too dangerous. You need experts to go along. - There's a bomb in here. Do you know what you're getting yourself into? - Hey! - It's out of the question. What's going on? Welcome back, Magneta, I see New York treated you right. Got a haircut, new clothes. Yeah, like I said, what's going on? [Dr. Lang] Mr. Faze, we feel if you go to Ranga, you should have an expert with you. What about Professor Stewart and Dr. Richards? After all that's happened, they might be dead. Chase wouldn't be that crazy. The man has sent his best ninja to kill you. That's not crazy? I'm not talking about us, we're expendable. What kind of logic is that? I still say- Hey, it's useless arguing. What do you think, Mavis? Well, I'm definitely against taking anyone else. It's gonna be very dangerous. Where's Dr. Taylor, shouldn't he have a say in this? He's on his way over here, but I'm sure he'll agree with me. We need an expert on Kamchia. But who? Actually, I've done more field work on Asiatic cultures than anyone at the Institute. That's right, she helped Melissa with the research. Well, how do you feel about going to Ranga, Doctor? I don't mind going. Are you sure, Doctor? Well, no, but, if it will help, I'll be more than happy to go. What do you think, Mr. Faze? Well, no one said it will be safe, but, you gotta realize, you'll be risking your own life. Mr. Faze, I'll go. Okay, it's settled then, we leave this evening. Where's Monique? Good question. Monique not only has an IQ above the genius level, she has an uncanny sixth sense. She knew something wasn't quite right. (fluttering music) Even I didn't suspect that El Kazi was still around. But he was here, and with plenty of ninja. Their mission, quite simple, kill us. (fluttering music) (thudding) (pulsing electronic music) (thudding) (grunting) Whew! (sword whispers) Monique! Oh, shit. (fluttering music) Well, I thought this only happened in movies. (fluttering music) (thudding) (shouting) (fluttering music) (whooshing) (thudding) (grunting) (shouting) (Faze moans) (thudding) (grunting) (pulsing electronic music) (thudding) (grunting) (fluttering music) (whooshing) (thudding) (grunting) (fluttering music) (thudding) (grunting) - Oops, sorry. - What are you doing? (grunting) (groaning) Hey, they're gone! They have a tendency to do that. Let's go. [Man In White] Perhaps someone in the village up ahead can tell us where this treasure is. Then we can waste these two punks. If anyone in this village knows anything, they won't tell you. [Man In White] And why is that? Ranga people are very superstitious, and you're strangers. [Man In White] Do you hear this woman? She's right. They have a strong belief in these zombie fighters. They call them shadow devils. [Man In White] Do you really believe this shit? Hell no, but it's best to be ready for anything. Are you so sure these devils aren't real? I'm no fool, Doctor, I don't believe in ghosts. I think you will very soon. (blooping) [Faze Voiceover] Enter the next player in our story. Now, if you thought that this was just another one of Chase's ninja, you're wrong. Ikor the Invincible is the protector of the treasure of Kamchia. When the treasure is threatened, he awakens to protect that treasure. He's just not your ordinary zombie. This guy knows ninjutsu to a T, and he doesn't die very easily, either. As well, he has a legion of fighters called shadow devils. He awakens these shadow devils to aid him in protecting the treasure. Chase might not believe in ghosts, but he sure wouldn't wanna meet one of these guys in a dark alley. (blooping) You two, come with me into the village. You men, move out. (tense music) [Ninja] Hey, hey. (thudding) (grunting) (blooping) (thudding) (grunting) (blooping) (tense music) No one's here. By the look of it, no one's been here for years. There's got to be some clues about the treasure around here somewhere. - Over there! (thudding) (grunting) My gun's got to be on that stinking bastard somewhere. Here it is. Okay, Robert, let's go. (funky music) (gun rattles) (groaning) Damn, it's empty. (funky music) You have come for the treasure? [Steven] Yes. You will die. - You're wrong. - You're dead! (fluttering music) (thudding) (grunting) (shouting) (thudding) (grunting) Go back (speaking foreign language). [Man In White] What happened to Stewart and Richards? They got away, that's what happened. [Man In White] Go find them! You won't believe this, Mr. Chase, but we just had a run-in with one of those shadow devils. You gotta be kidding. [Man In White] No, sir. He beat the shit out of some of the men, quite fairly, in fact. (Steven laughs) What's so funny? Where's my other gun? [Man In White] Here you are, sir. Thanks. (gun rattles) (groaning) There's your devil, a damn villager in disguise. [Man In White] Boss, that's not the same thing the men fought. That may be a villager there, but, shit, something weird's going on, real weird. What now, Melissa? We have to follow Chase. If he finds that treasure, the whole expedition will be a complete failure. What about the government agent? I forgot about that. Look, Robert, get back to camp, get to the radio! What about you? Forget about me, just get help. Melissa, I can't. Robert, if you don't, Chase is going to get us. No, you keep it. [Melissa] Good luck, be careful. (fluttering music) (gun bangs) (fluttering music) (gun bangs) (fluttering music) (thudding) Where are Mavis and Sheebah? Mavis and Sheebah have done all they can, I'm afraid. I don't understand. Mavis and Sheebah are civilians. This is a government affair now. Monique and I are government agents. As unsavory as it sounds, we're expendable. Right, you're a civilian, too, but, unfortunately, since you volunteered, you're now expendable. Oh, I see. You can still get out of this. No, Mr. Faze, I said I was sure about it, so I'm going. I knew you'd say that, but I was required to ask one last time. Here comes Lieutenant Louis. Lieutenant Louis, you're just in time. I'm afraid none of you will be on that plane. What's wrong, Lieutenant? Magneta, is this a joke? We've been taken off the mission? Now, let's just settle down. I don't wanna create a scene. Ladies, let's get going, we have a plane to catch. Right, Magneta. Mr. Faze, you set one foot in Ranga, and you're on your own. You screw up down there, and Washington will deny any connection with you. Just tell the commander I said goodbye. [Lieutenant Louis] Mr. Faze, please, wait a minute. I think I have to tell you the whole story. Now that's a good idea. Look, it's not the commander. Headquarters doesn't think you can handle this mission alone. Wow, now that's wow. I've never heard of anything so stupid. I didn't say I agree with the order. Remember, Commander Neblo chose you for the mission, Magneta. Okay, so what do we do? Well, we take some risks. [Monique] Where are you going? I'm not missing out on the fun. Well, lets rock and roll. (plane roars) About 11 hours later, we arrived at Ranger Base One in Ranga. I realized that whatever happened now, I would be risking not only my life, but the life and career of the commander. After all, he defied government orders by sending Lieutenant Louis with us. If we failed, the commander was finished. The head honcho at Ranger Base One was Chappy, a man who made the jungle his home, and a man who could handle a machine gun as easily as I used a fork. I knew right then we were in for some real serious shit. What about Dr. Stewart, any word yet? Not for several days now, I'm a little worried. It's treacherous terrain, and with this Chase guy running loose. Do you have any idea where Dr. Stewart's party is? Somewhat, she outlined her travel route. The trail starts here, goes through the mountains, and then down into the valley. So we have to follow that trail every step of the way? That may be the only way to find them. It's also a good way to fall into a trap. And if Chase is half as smart as we think, there are bound to be plenty of traps along the way. Chase won't be your only problem. There are Ranga villagers to deal with, and, of course, the shadow devils. Isn't that just a legend? It's like anything else, I guess. You either believe or you don't. What the hell is a shadow devil? An exotic mixture of voodoo and Zen Buddhism. The cult leader is Ikar. When the treasure is threatened, he and his devils waken to protect it. These villagers believe in them intensely, and they'll protect that treasure just as fiercely as any shadow devil. Whatever they are, it's a good idea to be prepared. I think it's a good idea for everybody to check into their rooms before dinner. And don't forget, dinner's on the way. In fact, I'll check on it now. (soft electronic music) Magneta, you're crazy. Mr. Faze. Mr. Faze. Yo, Mr. Faze. - Oh, sorry. What are you thinking about? Well, among other things, this damn mission. It's Marla, isn't it? Yeah, I guess you're right. You really love her, don't you? You're right, as usual. I think you oughta quit this business, marry her, and settle down in New York somewhere. Oh, and what do you know about marriage? Nothing, but I do know underneath all that kung fu, super-agent image, you're not happy. You're not only a genius, but you're a psychic, too. You know, you'd make a great doctor. Look, big brother, stop worrying. You can worry about all of that when you get to the States. Right now, we have a mission. Okay, okay, look, go get ready for dinner. Okay, but you hurry up. [Faze] All right, go on. At about the same instant, Dr. Richards had alluded Chase's ninja, and made his way back to the radio at base camp. He was trying to call for help. This is a code six alert, code six. Chase has killers after me and Dr. Stewart. Do you read me, do you read me? Hello? (groans) Sorry about that, Dr. Richards. No more communications with Ranger Base One. They're having technical difficulties. What in the hell is this all about? Well, I've been following you and Dr. Stewart ever since you boarded that plane. Melissa's right. I suppose you're the man in the brown leather jacket. The name's Karada. Okay, you win. Kill me, you punk. (thudding) (groaning) That's for being a smart ass, but I'm not gonna kill you yet. Some government agents are on their way here. You're gonna be the bait in my little trap. I'm not gonna help you with any of this, forget it. You don't have any choice. (smacking) [Faze Voiceover] The pot was really ready to boil now. El Kazi had finally arrived from the States, and, almost immediately, he and a small party of ninja had discovered a giant clue to the whereabouts of the treasure of Kamchia. (fluttering music) Look, the river, so what? Look what we found in the river. Matsui. A solid gold shuriken. Ha, it's part of the treasure! Mr. Chase, watch out! What the hell is this shit? Hold on, it's just another small time villager. I'll waste this bastard. (gun rattles) I don't think it's a villager. All right, get him. Get him! (blooping) (smacking) (whooshing) What the hell is this shit? (blooping) (Melissa screams) (blooping) (Melissa screams) (thudding) (grunting) Professor Stewart, I had a feeling you'd be back. Well, save your jokes, Steven. Robert is already back at the camp, calling for help. I don't think so. What do you mean? Melissa, did you notice on your flight a man in a brown leather jacket? I knew we were being followed, I knew it! Who was he? His name is Karada, head of the world's toughest kung fu team. Right now, he's probably giving Richards a real warm welcome. What are you gonna do to him? Nothing, yet. It was stupid of you to assume that I'd forgotten about Magneta Faze and his group. Karada, come in. - Green light. Okay, lead 'em right into the trap. - Got it. So, got it all figured out, huh? What happens to Robert now? If he cooperates, he'll be just fine. But if he screws up, Karada will bury him. [Faze Voiceover] At the very same moment, Karada wasn't even thinking about Robert Richards. He was busy planning an attack on RB-1, and he brought along a lot of help. (fluttering music) Just got a message from one of our relay stations. Dr. Richards signaled a code six alert. What does that mean? It means we got big trouble. The message indicates Chase killed everybody except Dr. Richards and Dr. Stewart. Good Lord, the man is insane! The relay messenger says Richards was cut off abruptly. That doesn't sound good. In fact, it sounds real bad. Chase probably hopes we'll rush right down there. Maybe it's one of those traps I was speaking of. We have a mission, let's get going. Everybody should check their equipment one more time before leaving. Damn, that girl's always disappearing. Who, Monique? Yeah. I think she went down by the trail, Magneta. Okay, I'll meet you guys down by the trail. (fluttering music) (smacking) (fluttering music) Monique! Damn. Looking for your little friend, huh? It's you. Well, if it isn't Magneta Faze. How long has it been, five years? Where's Monique, damn it! She's my prisoner. I want her back, now! Sorry, you have to look for her. (fluttering music) (grunting) (fluttering music) (groaning) (sword whistles) (groaning) Ninjas! (guns bang) (fluttering music) (gun bangs) (thudding) (grunting) Stay out of the jungle, or die. I mean it. (fluttering music) What the hell was that all about? We just had a visit from one of Chase's hit men, and he's got Monique. Who is he? His name's Karada, one of the world's most wanted assassins. Five years ago, he killed 15 people in Hong Kong. I tried my damnedest to catch him. Well, we better get going. Right, we gotta find Monique before it's too late. (wildlife cries) Hold it. (clattering) Shit, move it! (fluttering music) Check that way. (gun bangs) Good shot. Oh, shit! This is unbelievable! Believe it, Doctor, it's real. (wildlife chatters) [Dr. Geevas] I have got to rest, I'll catch up. [Chappy] It's not safe to sit too long. (fluttering music) (Dr. Geevas screams) (gun rattles) You okay, Doc? - Yes, thank you. - Better reload, Doc. Let's find Faze. (wildlife chatters) (grunting) (smacking) (fluttering music) [Karada] Mr. Faze, you are a very persistent man. I want Monique now! [Karada] Just worry about dying. Get him! (smacking) (grunting) [Faze] All right, Karada, where is she, talk. (thudding) [Karada] You'll have to find her, you fucking bastard. (smacking) (moaning) (echoing thud) Karada's dead, there's no sign of Monique. This whole damn setup stinks. (shouting) - Did you hear that? - Help! - That way. (wildlife chatters) - Monique, where are you? - Over here, smart ass. Don't make any sudden moves. Touch her and you're dead. [Man In White] You must be Magneta Faze. Yeah, what about it? [Man In White] Mr. Chase wants to see you. Release the child. Let's go. (fluttering music) You okay? Sure, it's my fault you got caught. Forget it. [Man In White] Shut the fuck up and move. You're gonna pay, bastard. (smacking) (moaning) [Monique] Mr. Faze! Don't worry, Faze, we'll get our chance. [Man In White] One more smart ass move and I'll cut all your asses up. Move it! (fluttering music) (gun bangs) What the shit was that? Go see what's going on, move it, move it, now! What's going on? I don't know. (fluttering music) (gun bangs) [Man In White] Go see what's happening, and hurry it up, move it! (gun rattles) Damn it, what the hell is going on? Shit! All right. Now look, we're gonna go take a look. Anybody moves, I'll kill Faze. Now you fuckers try something. Move it! (fluttering music) Looks like your men had some bad luck, huh? [Man In White] Okay, whoever's in the bushes, come out or Faze buys it, and I mean big. Who's there? All right, Faze dies now! (thudding) Oh, shit, now you got me mad! I'm gonna, where are you, come out! (gun bangs) (groaning) Shit, fucking. - Where's Mr. Faze? - Fuck the Faze. (moans) (smacking) (grunting) Mr. Faze, what? Ta-da, you folks okay? What happened? Got help from Lady Luck, better known as Mavis Jackson. - Who? - Mavis! I was in the neighborhood, just thought I'd stop by. Mavis, this is our guy Chappy. Think you know everybody else. You sure came along at the right time. I was beginning to get worried. You're a little late. Our flight got tied up, sorry. - Magneta, you knew. - Yeah. - But you said- - I know, but I had to do it in case we were being followed. I did it to fool the ninja. - Sheebah with you? - She's back at RB-1, helping with the clean-up operation. Those ninja caused you guys some serious trouble, huh? What's our situation? [Monique] Not great. - I'll explain on the way. - On the way to where? The next big challenge, finding Dr. Richards. (pulsing music) [Faze Voiceover] We were on a search for Dr. Richards. Meanwhile, Chase had gotten even closer to the treasure of Kamchia. (soft music) Keep an eye on her. (pulsing music) All right. (pulsing music) I'll be damned, I found it. Well, Melissa, we have reached the treasure site. If I wasn't a prisoner, I'd be tickled pink. Come, Doctor, have a closer look. (pulsing music) Okay, you found the treasure site. Now, how are you gonna get in and get the treasure? That's where you come in. You have a better knowledge of the cult of Kamchia. So get out your notes and let's find this treasure. What the hell is that? (tense music) [Melissa] Ikar, guardian of the treasure. Get him! (tense music) (whooshing) (smacking) (gagging) (whimpering) Damn it, Steven, don't you realize what you're up against? You're dealing with the supernatural! We'll see how supernatural this is. (gun rattles) (blooping) (whooshing) (thudding) (shouting) (echoing thud) [Melissa] Oh, Steven! (blooping) (tense music) [Faze Voiceover] We decided to make camp, take a breather from all the action, take time to check our weapons, and so forth, but it was a big mistake. A Zen saying goes that trouble never rests. You know those Zen guys are always on target. Before we realized it, Chappy was missing, nowhere to be found, to add to our list of troubles. So I decided we should look for him. This thing was getting more bizarre by the minute, but the most bizarre was yet to come. (soft music) Look! If I'm not mistaken, it's Dr. Richards' bag. It doesn't answer the question of what happened to Chappy. [Faze] Over there! [Dr. Geevas] It's Dr. Richards! - What's up, Mavis? - This way, you two. - Dr. Richards, Dr. Richards! - Well, he's alive. (thudding) (fluttering music) (gun bangs) (fluttering music) (clattering) (fluttering music) (gun bangs) (fluttering music) What the hell? Hi, guys. Looks like somebody didn't like us too well. (thudding) (fluttering music) She's dead. (solemn music) (funky music) (Faze shouts) (grunting) (clattering) (whooshing) (thudding) (grunting) (fluttering music) (grunting) (thudding) (echoing crunch) (fluttering music) (soft music) That's one heck of a story, Dr. Richards. - It happened. - With Lieutenant Louis dead and Chappy missing, it's another sad chapter to the story. Look, we'll make camp here for a few hours. I'll take first watch. (solemn music) (Melissa panting) (Melissa screams) [Melissa] Help! (Melissa screams) Somebody, help! Stay away from me, you thing! (screams) Help! (wildlife chatters) (Melissa screams) (wildlife chatters) [Faze] It'll be okay, take it easy. You okay? - Yes. Look out! [Faze] What the hell? Okay, I'll take care of it. (grunting) (smacking) Damn! Okay. (grunting) (smacking) I'll be damned! [Melissa] You all right? [Faze] Yeah, yeah, let's try something else. (shouting) (grunting) (smacking) Is he dead? [Faze] Yeah, I think so. [Melissa] I don't know how to thank you, Mister. [Faze] Magneta Faze, and you're Dr. Stewart, I presume? [Melissa] Yes. [Faze] Let's get back to camp before we have any more surprise visits. Yeah, right. Chase was within 100 yards of the treasure site, but Ikar, the guardian of the treasure, isn't in a very good mood after all these years. He killed Chase right on the spot. Doesn't sound like a very nice guy. Okay, now we got ninja and a pissed off zombie to deal with. - You stop, you stop, hey! - Whoa! I think we're in trouble. I think you're right. Look, friend, we don't want any trouble. Just let us pass. [Villager] Go back or (speaking foreign language). He just said, go back or die. I have a feeling we'll do this the hard way. Okay, on three, run like hell back the other way. One, two, three! [Villager] No, don't shoot, back the other way. (fluttering music) Sure is quiet. (birds tweet) I hate when it gets quiet. Always means something bad's about to happen. Not again! What do you know, modern technology in the jungle. Natives with guns. (fluttering music) Take your hands (groans). (fluttering music) What are you doing? Ouch. (Faze groans) [Faze] Damn! (fluttering music) Just how are we gonna get outta here? (thudding) Tell us why you've come for the treasure, or die. We're on an archeology expedition. We come in peace. Many before you have said this. They have died, also. Hmm, but might have use for you. Get your dirty hands off of me, you scuzzball bastard! You're a feisty vixen. (smacking) (Melissa moans) No one spits on me! Bring the knife. I'll show you all how we deal with stupidity. We got to do something, now! Right, I'm sick of this bullshit. (thudding) (grunting) Mr. Faze! Leave him, we'll take the rest. You, if he comes around, beat the hell out of him, and leave him for the snakes. Let's go. (fluttering music) [Faze Voiceover] I was out for about an hour. Then I got a rude awakening. (thudding) (grunting) Hey, you. (gun pops) Magneta. What a headache. Watch it! (gun pops) (groaning) Where's everybody else? The villagers took them away. Watch it, here's another one. (grunting) (gun pops) Hold it! What are you doing here? I got away. Okay, let's go. Hold it, I'll take care of this one. (fluttering music) (shouting) (thudding) (grunting) Now we can go. Sheebah, get back to RB-1. If you don't hear from us in 24 hours, send in the marines. I had sent Sheebah back to RB-1. Meanwhile, I and Monique headed in our attempts to save the rest. Chappy showed up, also. - Chappy! - Shut up! Stop it, she's done nothing. Feisty, all of you feisty, but all the feistiness in the world won't help where you're going. Well, I never thought I'd see you guys again. How'd you get here? Our friends here didn't give me much choice. I was answering nature's call, and five of these bastards grabbed me in the bushes. (thudding) - You better shut up! (chortling) Drop it. (grunting) (thudding) (smacking) Glad you made it. Sorry I couldn't be here sooner. Chappy, what happened to you? Let's talk about it later. I'd rather not hang around here. How'd you escape? Sheebah showed up just in time. Yeah, I sent her back to RB-1 just in case. Here are the guns and supplies. Some stuff is missing. That's not surprising. Wait a minute, where's Lieutenant Louis? [Faze Voiceover] No one told you? I'm sorry, man, she's dead. I know you two were good friends. I'm sorry, Chappy. This trip's really turning out to be a bummer, eh? Let's get outta here. (solemn music) [Faze Voiceover] Now, I've seen a lot of zombie movies in my life, but when you see this kind of thing in real life, you know there's something rotten in Denmark. This was just another challenge in our quest for the treasure. (soft music) At least I've lived long enough to see this. I've already had to fight one of these bastards. They don't die very easy. Okay, well, let's go fuck 'em up. I couldn't have said it better myself. Let's rock and roll. Here they come! (guns bang) [Chappy] Don't waste ammo, shoot 'em in the head. (guns bang) Thanks, Monique! (thudding) Is everyone all right? Do you think we got them all? Hell no, they just keep coming back. If my calculations are correct, we're almost out of ammunition. And that's bad news. You're right, we still have to get past Ikar. You don't mean our friend Ikar? Yeah, the head shadow devil. Which means he's the toughest bastard of the bunch. Okay, you all realize this is the toughest part of the mission, so if anyone has to back out now, say so. (clattering) - Ow! (fluttering music) [Melissa] Miriam, are you all right? Yeah, it's just a flesh wound. The ninjas have gone. - No, they're not. - What do you mean? Take care of Dr. Geevas. [Monique] Where are you going? On a hunt. I realized that with Chase dead, El Kazi's ninja were disoriented and probably getting the hell out of the jungle as fast as possible. I decided to cut off any escapees at the most direct route, and, boy, did I luck out. Hold it. I was wondering when you'd show up again. Your boss is dead, the party's over. Well, you can join the party by dying. Kill him. (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (Faze shouts) (sword whooshes) (thudding) (grunting) (grunting) (fluttering music) (Faze grunting) (weapons whistle) (smacking) (grunting) (weapons whoosh) (smacking) (grunting) (fluttering music) (thudding) (grunting) (shouting) (echoing, squishy crunching) - What happened? - Are you okay? Yeah. [Melissa] It's not great, but it's the best we have. Thanks. What about Dr. Geevas. [Melissa] She's gonna stay here and rest. Rest, who needs rest? You need rest. Magneta, I'll go. Okay, Dr. Richards, Chappy, stay with her. Got it. Dr. Stewart, you ready? [Melissa] All set, Mr. Faze. And, remember, Ikar doesn't die very easily. Good luck. (wildlife cries) What are you looking for? The (speaking foreign language). The what? The (speaking foreign language). Watch. No one's been here for hundreds of years except Ikar. (wildlife chatters) Look. It's the treasure! That's it? One sword, one lousy sword? Oh, God! - Mr. Faze, I don't think you understand, it's very spiritual. It's historical significant. And it's worth $15 million. Oh, well, that's one hell of a sword. Isn't it supposed to be hidden behind some trapdoor- No, no. With Ikar protecting the treasure, the villagers didn't think it was necessary. All right, well, let's get it outta here, now. (wildlife chatters) Then it happened. No sooner than I and Dr. Stewart had got the sword out of the cave, some of Ikar's zombies appeared. I sent her back to get help, and I was gonna use that $15 million sword for some cutting. (grunting) The next half-dead creep I had to face was all decked out in red and black, just like Ikar, so I figured he was one of the tougher shadow devils. I didn't care. I was gonna kick his ass anyway. (shouting) (thudding) (grunting) (shouting) And then, finally, Mr. Big himself, Ikar, showed his face, along with three more of his gruesome buddies. Now I knew it was time to get busy. (solemn music) (grunting) (smacking) Come on. (smacking) Damn, what the hell do I have to do to kill this guy? (thudding) (grunting) (fluttering music) (grunting) (thudding) Damn. (shouting) (thudding) (thudding) Oh my God. - Magneta! - No, Monique. Okay, damn it. I'm gonna have to do this the hard way. All right. (thudding) (grunting) After those whacks, I figured I'd stop playing around with this guy and really give it to him good. (grunting) (hissing) (smacking) (grunting) Oh, this can't be real. (thudding) (grunting) (dramatic music) (shouting) (squishing) (grunting) [Faze] Pretty good fight, huh? [Monique] You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Look, let's get the hell outta the jungle. I know y'all busy, but keep in touch. What you have done, we'll never forget. We did it because we care, but lay off the ninja-related stuff, okay? All right, see you later, you guys take it easy. Okay. So who wants to present this report to the board? - Okay. - Well- What Dr. Geevas is trying to say is- What I'm trying to say is- I know, considering I am head of the Kamchia research, I should present the report. - Yes. - Yes. I don't suppose I can bribe you? - No. - No. Well, why don't we just go to lunch and decide which one of you two will do the report? Well, I guess this is it, partner. It's been good working with you two. How'd you like to join the government? Thanks, but no thanks. I think I've had it with this for a while. I'm gonna take it easy, maybe go to Europe. You know, get away from it all. Anyway, thanks for the offer. I'll see you guys later. Hey, drop by for some pizza. I'm gonna miss her. Yeah, me, too. - Hey, Magneta- - Hold it. Magneta, when did you start calling me Magneta? Back in the jungle when I thought you were dead. Oh. Like I was saying, what are you gonna do now? I suppose you're hinting about Marla. I'm serious, aren't you tired of this business? [Faze] Nope. Don't you find yourself thinking about her a lot? Nope. What about those pictures of her you're always looking at? I tore them up and threw them away back in the jungle. But what if Marla- She's gone, hates my guts. Magneta, I don't think you realize- Look, let's drop it, I'm not in the mood, okay? All right, sorry I brought it up. Anyway, I've gotta go, I have a date. Hey, kid, sorry about that, okay? Hey, forget it, go see Marla, please? I gotta run. Go see Marla. Hmm, Marla, damn, those pictures. I should've thrown them away, but I haven't. (sighs) I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna have a good time, and I'm gonna forget all about this Marla. That's right, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Forget this shit. Now, going out was a waste of time because any woman that looked even remotely like Marla got my attention, so I ended up chilling at the park with a cold soda. Great way to spend a summer day, huh? What do you think you're doing? I, uh, I. Well, handsome, you just gonna stare at me? May I sit down? - You are sitting. - Oh, yeah, have a seat. Well, aren't you gonna say hello or anything? Uh, hello. I thought that- - I know, honey. So what made you? Monique and I had a little talk on the phone, and you were right, she's extremely intelligent. I know, I know, but I'm still confused. Don't be. Okay, so what now? Now you ask me to be your wife. (chuckles) Didn't we go through this once before? Yes, but I think you'll be much more pleased with the results this time. Don't you think we oughta discuss- Shh! Shut up and kiss me, you fool. (soft music) Where you going? Well, don't you wanna get married? [Marla] You were about to tear up my pictures, weren't you? [Faze] No, just testing for photographic durability. [Marla] Magneta, you're crazy.
