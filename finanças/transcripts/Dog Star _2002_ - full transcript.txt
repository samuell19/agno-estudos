A future seeing-eye dog is raised from birth by a volunteer family. At 10 months, the dog begins a year of training. 'Morning! Right. Chair. Good. Stop. Sit down. Good. Hey, lida! You're leaving yourself wide open. Keep your arm tucked in as you punch. This is how you do it. You got that? That's better. Keep it in mind. Alright, Shiro. Stay. Hey, Shiro. How are you today? That doesn't sound right. You hear that? Takeshita. Yes? What's with your right arm? Nothing. Are you concealing an injury? No, my arm has healed. That hurts! I?m using very little pressure. It doesn't hurt. lf you ignore the pain signals, you'll ruin your career. There's proof before your eyes. Go and see the doctor. Now! I?ll fight any time. These punk kids wouldn't stand a chance. I like to hear that. Allow me to buy you one, Gong Down the hatch! I drank too much. Let's go. Shiro. Go. Don't you start. I know I shouldn't drink. When you're angry, you walk differently. Next time you can have a drink, too. Michelle. Sit. Good. Wait. Okay. Leica, sit. Good. Wait. Okay. Shiro. What's the matter, boy? lf you don't eat, you won't get well. Still not eating? He doesn't eat at home, either. You've got to get better. I guess it's time to make my rounds. I?ll turn the lights off. Sleep well. You don't look very happy. Still awake? I came back for the keys. Can't sleep? You poor thing. Gong's death wasn't your fault. Don't take it so hard. Where are those keys? Here. Don't be so scared. I?m in a bit of trouble. I?ve been told that I can't get in to heaven. I didn't do many good deeds here on earth, so I have to fix that up before they'll let me into heaven. So I thought I should do something for you, Shiro. You don't believe me? I?m serious. Go on, make a wish. Anything, whatever you want. Hurry it up. Are you serious? That's a tough wish to fill. Come on, then. The enclosed file lists all the names. This will help you to solve the case. A pity it has to be this fella. He's a cop but it's the only death we have today. Shiro, no! Cut it out. You're a human, now. Don't blow it. Your old home? This is hers. No mistake. What are you doing? Oh, shit. What's going on here? The house is vacant. Nobody lives here? Not a soul. Where did they go? It must be ten years ago by now. The entire family was killed in a plane crash. It was so sad. So, what's your connection with all this? Come on, my little pretty. Something wrong? C'mon, my pretty. That was bad luck, wasn't it? Not much we can do about that. Since you're a man now, let's go get laid. I remember now. Their daughter wasn't on the plane. Are you sure? What's that big soccer town? Kashima City. I think that's where she is now. Thank you very much. Thank you so much! Are you satisfied now? C'mon, let's go. Let's get going, Shiro. So you're a virgin, are you? You're gonna love women. Be serious. What do you mean? You're just like you were, you're far too slack. Do you realize who you're talking to? We're equal now. I granted your wish to become a man so you could find this girl. Don't you forget that. Alright. Suit yourself. Do as you please. You're not coming? I?ll go by myself! Look at him. He's cute. You like him? He's lovely. His name is Shiro. Pat him. Pick him up. Shiro. See this? It's my bicycle. See the bike? Okay, a big smile. Say cheese. Haruka, it's time to say goodbye. Shiro Do your best to become a good seeing-eye dog. Shiro Sit. Wait. Come. Thanks for the ride. Good morning. Hold on, please. Miss Suzuki. You're late again. Try to be on time. I?m sorry. -See to it. -Yes, sir. Okay, everyone. Back to your seats. Good morning. Let's all try to be friends. I like the sandbox. It's a zoo! Wait! They never listen to me. Don't do that. You want animals? Good morning. Have you all been good? That's nice. So many animals today. Here they are. Open up. Let me through. I?ll put them down. Look at them. Say hello to them. Aren't they cute? Hello there. I?ll help you. Can you take these? Haruka, grab this. Here. What's next? Take this squirrel. There's nothing to be scared of, Haruka. What is Miss Suzuki carrying? Guinea pigs! That's right! Now go ahead and stroke them. There are three things to be careful of. First, don't yell out loudly. Never run near them. And never try to grab them from behind. Always from the front. Okay, go and play with them. I?ll show you the chicks. Rabbits over here! Now who wants to feed the goat? Pick some grass for Bonnie the goat. He must be hungry. What are you doing? I?ll call the police on you. Get out of here now. He's escaped! Quickly, grab it. Catch it. Thanks. You're a naughty rabbit. Thanks for that. You must have a gift. He doesn't usually like men. Hands up if you had fun. Let's all say the words of farewell. Farewell and take care. Tomorrow again, in good health. Farewell and take care. Tomorrow again, in good health. Now get your things and file out. Be careful. What? You can see me, can you? Alright. I guess you can. Listen. Never get scared by fate. You don't know fate? How to put it? Enjoy your life. Have fun to your heart's content. Do you understand what I say? Riku, what's up? Are you still mad at me? -See you. -Goodbye. Darling! Sorry I?m late. -See you. -Goodbye. I love you! Excuse me. Hello? Excuse me. Can you grab that book for me? Thank you. Psychology of Autistic Children Hi, Hagi. Just finished work? Can I go with you? I?ll pedal. Didn't I tell you? It's not worth being a human being. You and I are finished, right? Inside, you're still a dog, aren't you? Chasing after your master all day. Who is she? Cheeky thing. It's not your concern. Don't you get it? You can't go and tell her that you're her old dog. Don't get so upset. I spoke out of turn. Look, I?m sorry. Wake up. C'mon, get up. You slept here? Out you come. Come on. -I?m sorry. -I don't mind. No job? Are you unemployed? That's right. You wanna work here? You appear to have mysterious powers. Listen, when you finish cutting, go and give Bonnie a feed of it. The goat, Bonnie. Go back to the cage. In the cage with you. This way. Hello. Hi there. This is Shiro. He started work here today. He's great. He's got a way with animals. Were you an animal in a previous life? Don't get so upset. I was only kidding. They all reckon I was a monster in my previous life. Feel that. It's really warm. It should be. It's alive. It's the dung from my beloved animals. Take as much as you want. Thank you. Give her a hand with the manure. Too heavy for her. Thanks. Just leave it here. No need. I can do that. My boss said to help you. I?ll get the tools. It's all finished. Yes. You're lucky. My food is great. I?m a good cook. She's back here again. What's up? I thought you were busy. This is a gift from my boss. What is it? There's no need for that. Wine? That's very kind of him. Join us for dinner. No, thank you. I?ll go broil the squid. Wait here. I won't be long. The children had so much fun they want you back next week. Once more before summer vacation. Okay, I?ll be there. Want some? No thanks, I?m fine. See you. Do you hate animals? Why ask that? I don't know. You seem to be scared. Look. isn?t he cute? Poor things. Kept in cages all day. Why can't they be free? Why don't you let them out to live freely? They'd all die. Why? It just wouldn't work. They can't survive on their own. One, two, three... Well done. Now everybody into the pool. Start with youngest. Dip your legs in first. What's wrong, Riku? You want to join them? It's fun playing in the water. You come with me. Hold on. Don't wet your pants. Let's hold our breath under water. That was quick. Who's the longest? You win! Ready, Riku? Now kick your feet. Good. That's great. Look this way. Very good. Having fun? Now try it on your own. There you go. Well done, Riku. You're getting better. What's that for? Stop it. That's enough, boys. -What is it? -Look at Riku! Get an ambulance! Quick. Come on, we're leaving. Let's go. Not that way. Hello? Yes? Yes, speaking. is that right? Yes, I understand. A cancellation. Unload. A boy died so they canceled. C'mon, go back. Want some? I don't want anything. Look, it really wasn't your fault. Don't dwell on it. That was his fate. You should know that. You had to believe your parents' deaths were fate, too. It couldn't be helped. Quit being a kindergarten teacher if you want. We can live together. I?m okay. Stop worrying. What? What's he doing? What are you doing? They've germinated. They have. They're sprouting. They're so tiny. Have this. It's a holiday. Summer vacation. Here I am drinking beer while everyone's working. But it feels good. Drink up. I need a partner in crime. Okay, sure. The parallel bars and jungle gym, everything is so small. Like a fairy world. Through adult eyes, yes. To a kid's eye, it's normal, and to a dog... ...they're gigantic. To a dog? You say weird things. How was your family after that? After what? I mean... ...your family... ...I hear you lost your family years ago. Was your family... ...was it a happy family? Yes, I think so. We were a happy family. Great! That's fantastic. No matter how hard you try, you can still lose everything. How did this happen? Are you talking about your parents? Or the boy... Just in general. No. It's nothing. It looks like your luck has turned. Sorry to interrupt. This kid wants to say goodbye to her. Bye bye. The pool was fun. See you. I?ll take the kid to the gates of heaven. You're not like most people. You think so? Don't misunderstand. I mean in a good way. Good morning. Hi there. I?d like to work with you guys. Over the vacation. But that means handling animals. I?ll do my best. After all, I am a teacher. I can't afford to pay you. Alright. It's just for the vacation. Okay then, you might as well start now. Gee, thanks. -Sorry. -Sorry. Think about the animals, not just yourselves. I?m tagging along. Goats mainly eat straw. The last straw! You know that saying? Clutching at straws! Feed Bonnie. That's her name. Wait. Wait for me! Stop chasing him around. They won't be with us much longer. That's how it goes. That's their fate. You can't fight it. Like me dying, that was my fate. I don't agree. How else can I accept the reality?
