Shui, what will our future be? Do you have any plans? Plans? Plans. It's not... - as simple. - What does that mean? - It means... - What? I'll tell you tomorrow. Hey! You've worked with my dad for so long. You started with 150 dollars and reached 1,500 dollars now. That's not enough. It is. Why is it not enough? A raise from 150 dollars to 1,500 dollars, it's already ten times higher than what I got before. I'm an orphan and I'm thankful for your dad - for looking after me. - What? Looking after you by paying you 1,500 dollars? - Are you well fed then? - So what? Ask him for a raise, as much as possible. So you can pay for a house, a car and get married, understand? I don't think I can afford a house and a car. - But I can consider getting married. - Why? Your dad is worried about your marriage. He would be so happy - if someone wants to marry you. - Me? I'm slim and adorable. The villagers are drooling all over me. Our neighbor, Chen, said the same when he sold us the pigs last year. Since you have good memory, ask Dad for a raise tomorrow. - I know. - You better remember. Let's go before Dad notices us. Hey! A shooting star! Make a wish and your wish will come true. It's just a shooting star and you believe it? Look! This is especially for you! - What are you looking at? - You really do believe? What did you wish for? I wish we can be together soon. You'll rise above and make lots of money, and we will live happily ever after. Why didn't you wish for me to get a raise tomorrow? What an idiot. Who is throwing stones at me? Who is that? You bastard! Wait there, don't move! Why are you throwing stones at me? - No. I... - Tell me why? - I'll tell you tomorrow. - Are you looking for trouble? Get out of my sight immediately! Get lost you bastard! PAY BEFORE YOU FISH Boss, I want to talk to you about something. I want a pay raise. Any amount is fine, so I can be done with it. It's just my wishful thinking. I'm going too far for wanting this. I won't do this anymore. It's you? How dare you made fun of me? You are really adorable. How dare I make fun of you, Shui? I admire your guts for asking my dad for a pay raise. - You're great. - Is it? - Shui, you've got guts. - Awesome. Guts? I don't have much, just a little. - But my dad is very tough. - Tough? I've never seen any tough guy. Those who are right should be tough, right? But... my dad has been good to you, right? Yes, a salary of 1,500 dollars and I work like a dog. He gave me all his old stained clothing. I owe it to him. Ask him to get lost! I must ask him for a raise by all means... - How much will that be? - At least 50 cents more! Want a raise of 50 cents? Sure! I'll raise it to a dollar! Good for you? - I can't take that. - You can! From now on, you'll get 1,501 dollars per month. Satisfied? Get out if you are not! You'll soon be a beggar! Completely satisfied. Move! Bastard! Kid! Dad. I asked you to be my lookout and yet you're scaring me. - Where's Dad? - He's out, five dollars. Bloodsucker, I'm broke because of you. It's a risky job. If Dad finds out, I'll lose my Chinese New Year red packets. I want a raise next month. You little thief! My sister... Our noodles price increased three times a year. It's very kind of me to ask for a raise in three years. If you don't wish to pay me, get married to Shui soonest possible. I wish, but Dad looked down on him. Who knows what the future holds? You would need to trick Dad into agreeing to the marriage. What kind of plans can you suggest? Pay me 200 dollars and I'll tell you. What do you mean 200 dollars? You must be joking. I'm digging my own grave. Once you're married, I'll have no income anymore. There you go. I know you too well. You took my money, so spill it! - Tell me! - I will. I am very professional. One word, what's done cannot be undone. Dad will not live with that embarrassment. Shui might not agree even if I do. I've never heard of any man turning it down. He might be the only one. - If he refused, rape him. - Crazy. What the hell? My face is scarred. Can you not aim at my head? Yes, I'll aim elsewhere next time. - Dad's gone. Come in. - Okay. You're blind. - Come in. - Are you ready? The show is starting soon. - Are we going for a movie? - Yes. Stupid couple. You're so adorable. What are you doing? I don't feel like watching movies tonight. Are you feeling well? I want us to do some other things. Other things... I'm very full. - I'm hungry. - What? Where are you going this late? Tell me! - There's a show. - A show? Damn! I never know anyone as degrading as you! And you didn't tell me? Let's go! What can we do here at this hour? I'm afraid of the dark. I have something to ask you, but you have to answer me. What is it? Hopefully nothing too hard. Have you ever paid to have sex? Never! Have you ever thought of making love? - No. - Are you sure? How do you want me to answer? Do you remember our plan on getting married? In five years. Have you ever thought of the things we can do before getting married? Isn't it too early to book for banquets? No, I am not talking about that. It's too early to get our invitation card printed as well. No! What else then? Bridal Chamber. What? You're naughty. What do you mean? The bridal chamber! - Didn't you think about... - Hush! I know. I know we can do that after marriage but never thought of doing it in advance. We can if I agree to. If we do that and your dad found out, he will definitely throw me out. - He won't. - Why so? He won't forsake cheap labor. You are right. As a lady, I'm throwing myself at you. What else do you expect? You really are... Bastard! It really is him. - You beast! - Dad, don't... How dare you do this to me? I've done nothing other than kiss her! That's all! Shut up! I brought you up, provided you with education, gave you a job and I even clothed you! - Dad. - How dare you lure my daughter! - Dad. - Shut up! My only hope in life is for her to get married to a good and successful husband. Are you even close to that? You're hopeless! Don't touch my daughter! Listen carefully! Never let me see you again! If I see you again, I'll break your legs. Get lost! Let's go! Let's go! Where are you going? You're leaving without saying a word? Do you have cash? What about me? What can we do? - I'll tell you tomorrow. - No. - Tell me now. - Okay, I'll tell you now. I can't think of anything. I don't even know what would become of me, let alone you. I don't care, Shui. I want to be with you. You would suffer if you come with me. I don't care as long as I'm with you. Ti! Leave now. Stop talking and leave. - Are you coming too? - You wish! Dad is coming. Be good and take good care of Dad. All the cosmetics on my dressing table are yours. I told you to stop talking! You are making me cry. Bastard, are you eloping with my daughter? - We have to go! - Hey! Take the money. - Where did you get so much money? - From Dad. - We have to get going. - Let's go! You're a bad daughter! I brought you up and you're leaving just like that? Dad! - Run, Ti! - Let go of me! - Run! - Let go of me! Dad, let them be. Don't ever come back! Dad, take care of yourself. We'll be back to visit when Shui is successful. He'll never make it! Trust me, I'll take good care of you. Do you trust me? Do I trust you? I'll tell you tomorrow. ROOM FOR RENT - Looks like it's here. - Is it? Not bad! The room is bright and it has a balcony too. At 800 dollars a month, it's cheap. - It's made out of wood. - Of course. If it's paper, it'll tear by now. - It's inconvenient. - Why is it inconvenient? No one knows what you're doing once you shut the door. It's not soundproof. What about water and electricity charges? Water is included, electricity is not. It'll be expensive then. Take it or leave it! What do you expect with 800 dollars? - Stop disturbing my sleep. - Yes. She's right. You need to pay two months advance deposit and one month's rent. It's the rule. Count it. Forget it, it's only two thousand. Don't worry about it. When I first worked with Pig, I saw diamonds as big as an egg and yet I wouldn't care to pick them up. - Let me issue you the receipt. - You've been working with Pig? - He's been working with Pig. - Is it your mom? - Is it your mom? - That was a long time ago. - Is she your mom? - She's Ms. Mabel. She works as a dancer at the nightclub. - I see. - She's still young and well. Why would she be a nightclub dancer? - What now? - What else? Go and get your furniture. This is so pretty. It's so lumpy. Let's see how much it costs. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. DOUBLE HAPPINESS Hey, you can't eat yet. - I didn't. - Come here. Amitabha Buddha... Cheers. One Two A boat sails Oh, my God. - Why are you singing this song? - Then what should I sing? Let's cheers on our wedding day and use the grave as the bridal chamber. Looking for Pingyang Gate in hell - What are you doing? - Thank you Emperor for your kindness. - My wife and I bow down to you... - My wife and I bow down to you... - Marriage is serious. - I'm just fooling around. - Ti. - What? Let's exchange that wooden chopsticks of yours. No, I bought that for you. I'm not used to such luxury. You're the head of the household, you should get used to it. Let's do this. This is much better. Pick a smaller one. What a big bite. LABOR OFFICE COUNSELING DEPARTMENT Mr. Shih, how can we help you? - Actually I came here to... - He wants a job with good prospects. All available jobs are posted outside. We've seen them all. None of them offer good prospects. Mr. Shih, for a man without an educational background and working experience, - Dim Sum apprentice is good. - No. You can't meet anyone by hiding in the kitchen all day. - Construction worker is good too. - Sure. No! It's too dangerous. - Learn makeup then. - No! Clients are mostly ladies. - A cleaner? - No! That job is for me. - What about an Accountant? - That's good. - Anything else? - An engineer. That's great, anything else? - A designer. - That's it! Where is the workplace? In the Castle Peak Asylum. There are eight Anita Mui, seven Shakespeare, three Batman and a poet, Chu Yuen. One more designer makes no difference. I'd rather be Batman, at least, I have a mask to wear. What is wrong with you? Squatting in the middle of the way. Ti! Get out here! Quick! - What now, boss? - Get over here. Clean that mess over there. I've just done cleaning. Did someone pee there? - No. - Pooped? - No. - Then... - Vomited! - What? Disgusting! What the hell? - Ten cents for each point. - What? Ten cents for each point. - I'm sorry. - What's wrong with you? Fat Ming caught a sucker. - Over there. - Who is he? I got over half a million points on this game and you are betting against me? If my husband is mature, people wouldn't look down on him. Even if I have to suffer my whole life, I wouldn't mind. I'm not sure what am I doing now. I'm sorry. I'll go home and start applying for jobs. I won't act like a jerk anymore. - What? - I won't act like a jerk anymore. - You are still jerking off? - No, I will quit. Hello, how have you been doing? We've found lodging in a high-class residential area with excellent surroundings. Our house is large and bright with glass windows. We can even see the sunset. I'll give you my number. You and Dad can visit us. Darling! Where are you! We'll talk later. - Darling! - I'm here. Why are you so excited? I've got a letter from Yong Bu Fa Jewelry Company. I applied for the Executive Trainee and I got a reply. - Is that so? What does it say? - I don't know. Don't be too happy. Are you sure you are hired? It's in English, I don't understand. - Ms. Mabel. - Morning, Ms. Mabel. You're well educated. I'm sure you can read English, right? - Can you read it for me? - Please. The letter says you're extraordinary and the best. You're the only one who received this letter. What else? It says here, you bastards are noisy and it keeps me awake every morning. Your future kids will have no ass! Damn you, bitch! - You bitch! - Calm down. Well, what right does she have to say that? - Sir! - Why are you guys up so early? - Do you have an English dictionary? - No. - Let's go and get one. - What is it? Let me see. You can call him via 7654211. You have an interview at 9:30 a.m. the day after tomorrow. Sir, you know English? When I was in Oxford, I helped the professor compiled the dictionary. Sir, you went to university? That was a long time ago. How did that happen? Mr. Wong has invited me for an interview. Wait a minute. No problem. What happened after that? The bastard lost his chance then? Really? I told you so. The bastard is nuts to threaten her. Really? He was that stupid? I really can't stand it. Okay, talk to you tomorrow. You can go in now. Why did you blink? Yes, I blinked. I know, you did something unforgivable and you're guilty of it. - No, I didn't. - No? You blinked 357 times in a minute! I can't turn it back. I'm so sorry, please don't call the police. We're a jewelry business. We expect three things from a Marketing Executive Trainee. First is honesty. Second is also honesty. The third is also honesty. - Do you understand? - Yes, I understand. I'm very honest. People said the earth is round and you believe it? The earth is in fact round. That is absurd. Forget it, I won't argue with you. You need to pay a bond of 20,000 dollars in order to work with us. - What do you mean 20,000 dollars? - It's fine if you want to pay more. What's wrong? Hi, Ti! Dad misses you, so I brought him here to see you. - Welcome. - What are you talking about? I miss my money. I thought you stayed in a high-class residential area with excellent surroundings. You're so well off, why didn't you pay me back? The only thing you know is exaggerate. It's ridiculous! If you're regretful, come home with me. Dad, I don't regret anything. I'll stay with him no matter what. Bring Dad a cup of tea. Okay. Move. I promised your late mom that I'll care for you and have you marry a good husband. What should I do now? What should I say to your mom when I die? Dad, believe me. Shui will not let you down. Dad, have some tea. Ti and I were married anyway. You should drink this cup of tea. - Darling, let's go. - Dad, you said you were thirsty. Drink it. I can't drink this. If I drank it, I'll lose my daughter. Dad, drink it and you have a son-in-law. If you refuse, you're left with nothing. - Didn't you realized? - Nonsense. Let's go! Move! Dad. Why are you smiling? I'm thirsty! Take care. I'm leaving. - Let's go. - Dad. What is it? Are you giving me another drink? - We want to borrow 20,000 dollars. - What? You're asking me 20,000 dollars for a cup of tea? I don't have so much money! Dad. Ti, do you need the money for medical treatment? - Are you sick? - No. Actually, I need it for a bond. - Because I've found a job... - Really? - So, you need it? - Yes. Now it's the time for you to prove yourself. If you're capable, find a way out yourself. Don't make your wife borrow from her dad! Bloody kid! Let's go! Dad. You'll never starve to death in Hong Kong. As long as you're physically fit, you can do anything except this. But you can never tell. How much do you want to borrow? - Just 20,000 dollars. - Just 20, 000 dollars? This amount is not too much nor too less, but it's already hard for you. Do you have to work at night? There's tea dance where you work from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Can you make it back home by then? This is not a problem. Is it possible to not do anything that's unfair to my husband? It's impossible for me but I'm not sure about you. I'm sure I won't. I'll smile and contained myself. I'll be a prostitute with high integrity! - Boo! - Boo! Where did you get so much money? - Guess. - You're working as a club dancer? No, guess again. You robbed someone. No, I won the lottery! I'm so lucky! Oh, the lottery. But the prize is so much lesser. - It's just third prize. - Still so much lesser. - I split it with Mabel. - Is it? You have enough to pay the bond now. You should work hard, understand? Of course, I will. Even God is on my side, I must work hard. Darling, did you really won third prize with Mabel? - Yes, why? - You've been cheated! See for yourself! The prize for this term should be 60,000 dollars. See for yourself. Next term will be 60,000 dollars. - What do you mean by next term? - What an idiot. - Yes. - Let me see. Yes. Go to bed. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Shih Chin Shui. This is my first day at work. Looking forward to working with you. You're too kind, thank you. Does it look like me? This? - Yes. - It's me. Is it? This place is mine! That's why. - Please stay alert. - Have a seat. Sir. Sir. - Why are you still here? - I'm looking for my place. It's over there. This is the company's revenue in the first half. Work out the figures for me. Shouldn't this be assigned to the Accountant? It's the point of view. This is the history of the company's business. You can't do your job unless you understand the history. Start with the calculation. - It's mine. - You have no time to read it. Sir, it's done. Well? There you go, sir. Here, let me calculate this for you. - Three, four... - I don't trust this calculator. You don't? Trust me then. Should I trust you? I don't even trust myself. Calculate it again. What on earth do you want? There's nothing between me and Eva. We're in a public area, please contain yourself. You are blaming me? You've been working day and night. Paul, Dad entrusted his business to me. There are lots to do. - Why can't you be more considerate? - Didn't I? We've been together for three years. What do you want? Are we ending this relationship just like that? I didn't mean that. The problem is will you accept me? What do you want me to do? The problem is not with me, understand? I'm in a hurry, I have an appointment with a client. Hey! Miss, tissue. What? - The elevator broke down. - Yes. How is this possible? Miss, are you in a hurry? Forget it, don't be sad. You can talk it through. Are you eavesdropping? I was already here when you started fighting. From what I can see... Forget it. What are you trying to say? In fact, he sincerely wanted to explain himself to you, but he was ashamed to say it in my presence. Men have ego, I know that. You've been together for three years. There're twenty-four hours in a day. And in three years, there will be more than 20,000 hours. If you gave him few minutes to explain himself, you'll save 20,000 hours of your relationship. Isn't that worthy? Sometimes, we need to take an optimistic view in life. Thank you. You work in this building too? I still have calculations to do. Not sure how long this will take. I have an appointment with a client too. - Can you climb? - Where? - There's an opening up there. - Climb up there? Are you alright? I'm fine, what about you? Let me give you a hand. It's okay, I have so many to carry and you're in a hurry. If so... - Let's talk tomorrow. - Okay, let's go for coffee tomorrow. Where can I find you? Let's dance. Ouch! Go to hell. I'm sorry. Forget it, Mimi. Kowloon Tong, please. - Let's go to Kowloon City. - No. The fare is almost the same. No, I want to go home. You're trying to back out. I need to rush home to take care of my brother. - How old is he? - He is 24 years old. - He's old enough. - He acts like a 14-year-old. - He's retarded? - Yes. If I don't go back to him, he might end up eating the wall. How can he bite through cement? The last time I went home late, he ate my washing machine. You need to keep an eye on your dryer too. When your aunt visits and looks after your brother, - make sure you call me. - Sure. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Move. All done! The total amount is 2,380... Shit! It's gone! Help him pick it up. Hold up. - Are you talking to me? - If not, who else? - What is it? - Didn't you watch where you're going? It's lucky you bumped into Ms. Kuan, what if she's a client? - Right? - Forget it. Hey, you. Say something. - Can I not say anything? - No. At least apologize. - But... - What? Apologize. You didn't know what happened. I didn't know if your dad is a robber but I still hired you. - Right. - Apologize then. Sorry. - Forget it. - Apologize in English. Forget it. Mr. Wong, your observation is deteriorating. Didn't you know she's the boss' daughter? I didn't. What will happen to me now? Just wait and see. I have to find another job again. Why is it out of order again? Climb up there. - You're... - We were stuck in the lift last time. - What a coincidence. - I don't want to either. Are you mad about being stuck or seeing me again? Both. Why don't you want to see me again? Whatever. Why aren't you in the mood this time? - How do you know? - Because of your boss? It's part of the job. I'll just cry secretly at home. - You speak as if you were... - A whore. Being a whore is better as she has the right to choose her clients. Us as employees can't even defend ourselves. I have to apologize in Cantonese and English. Who did you apologize to? - You. - It's you? Hey! Ms. Kuan, is this yours? - Why did you have it? - I remembered it was yours. That man found it and gave it to me. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. Hey, where are you going? Let me drive you. Excuse me. I've apologized in the office. I hope you can leave me alone. Forget it. I was going to apologize but seems like it's unnecessary. Let me drive you instead. Excuse me. Hold on... Just now I... When I talk... - Where's your car? - My car? - Didn't you say you wanted to drive me? - I was talking about the Metro. - Metro? - What about the bus? I still have my job then. I'll let you know tomorrow. Hey. Why are we having dinner in such a fancy restaurant? - I have something to tell you. - What? The daughter of my boss praised me today. Really? She praised you in your presence? Any raise? Absolutely no problem. Let's order something nice to celebrate. I'm proud of you. It's in English, I can't read. - Let's eat at the stalls. - Don't be ridiculous. We don't have to order according to the menu. Just order anything you like, we can afford it. Are you sure? - Let's just eat at the stalls. - I'll order for you. Excuse me. - What's your order? - Give me two steaks. - Any soup? - Sir, what's your order? - A cup of coffee, please. - Okay. That's all. I'm going to the men's room. I can afford it, don't worry. - Mr. Li. - Mimi. I thought you've found somebody. Who was that man? - He's my brother. - What? - The one who ate the washing machine? - Yes. I'm keeping my work a secret, not to provoke him. Pretend you don't know me, because I don't know what I should say to him. No problem. But what will happen if he sees us together? You can never tell. He might swallow all the forks and knives. - He's eating the fork. - What? Go over there now. I'll go there now. - Who is he? - What? Him? That person? Didn't you remember him? Who is he? - You really don't remember? - Who is he? - You don't remember? - Who on earth is he? - Can you remember? - Tell me who he is. - You really can't remember? - I can't unless you tell me. You can't remember when I didn't tell you. You won't remember even if I tell you. Why should I tell then? Sorry, it's my fault. You're messing with me. - Miss, how many guests? - I'm looking for someone. This way, please. - Hey! - Hey! - Who is she? - The daughter of my boss. - What a coincidence. - Are you alone? I have an appointment with a client. Ms. Kuan, over here. Sorry, please come over. Let me introduce you both. He's the manager of Chia Shu Jewelry Company. Is he? - Come with me. - I'm joining as well. Sure. Let's go. You knew each other? You knew each other too? I met her in the library. Yes, in the library. - Let's sit. - Okay. Let me introduce you both. He is my colleague, Mr. Shih Chin Shui. This is the General Manager of Chia Shu Jewelry Company, Mr. Li. - Mr. Li - Mr. Shih - How do you do? - Nice to meet you. Mr. Shih is very capable. This is really unexpected. Doesn't look like it. It's the look that counts, not the brains. Looks? Ms. Kuan, I can never imagine your company would hire someone like him. - Well, you can't have him. - Thank you. Why would I want him? - Ms. Kuan, you're lucky then. - So... who is she? - She is my... - His sister. Sister? What do you want to say? I rather you made the story up or copied it from a movie. You secretly worked in the nightclub to help your husband. You met Mr. Li in the nightclub and you told him I'm your brother. It's a coincidence that all of us met here today. So you had to say that you're my sister. I want you to tell me the truth. At least give me an explanation. I'm not blaming you. I know you have your reasons but you shouldn't have kept it from me. I won't be angry with you. What do you have to say now? - Tell me. - Mr. Li... I really met him in the nightclub. Open up! Open up, you bitch! - Hey. - Leave me alone. Go away! Why? Are you trying to avoid me? Bitch! - How dare you do such a thing? - Shui! - It's not Ms. Mabel's fault! - Get out! - It's not her fault! - Not her fault? - It's not her fault! - Shut up! Let him be, Mabel is not back yet. So what? I'll wait until she's back! Stand here! What happened? She killed your father? That tramp took my wife to join the nightclub. A nightclub dancer? Where? It's not her fault, I asked for her help. I didn't do anything unfair to you. Shut up! Hey. - Seems like it's not her fault. - That tramp took my wife to join her as a nightclub dancer. I'm cursing her. Are you done? Never, you bitch! - Say that again? - I'll say it three times more. Bitch! Bitch! So? - Go to hell! - You hit me? I can do three more slaps to get you back to your senses. Do you think I want to take your wife with me? I have to look out for her every day and I get no commission. - What did you say? - You... Your wife went to work because of you. She helped you with the bond. You've got nothing to say now, right? You should be grateful to your wife. Great. All of you are encouraging her to do it. Great! Darling! - He'll not know if I didn't slap him. - Allow me. What a fool. Do you have a lighter? Sorry, I forgot the cigarettes. You're a lucky man for having a wife who loves you. What else do you expect? She's a nightclub dancer. She's not the only one. My friend Liu Yung's girlfriend Li Sze Sze is also a whore. So what? When you're in that situation, you have no choice. Besides, your wife hasn't been unfaithful to you. What did you say? Liu Yung and Li Sze Sze are from Sung dynasty. You know them? Of course! General Yu Fei is an old friend of mine too. You must be joking. When I followed Emperor Chin to Japan to get the elixir, I took one secretly and stayed like this. Forget about the past. Go and apologize to your wife. Why are you staring at me? Go! Get in. Sorry. Are you talking to me? I'm really good for nothing. You shouldn't have suffered. We are married. We should be there for each other. - A shooting star. - Yes. - What are you doing? - Making a wish. It's just a shooting star and you believe it? What did you wish for? I wish I could perform better and succeed at work, so you won't have to suffer. That's all. PRINT AND COPY Where's your husband? He's over there. What are you doing? Get over here. - Get over here! - Hey. - You're here. - He looks handsome. My husband. This is Eva. Your wife is so good to you. Today is her last day. Take good care of her from now on. We don't want to see her here ever again. It's all up to you now. There'll be no next time. - So disgusting. - See you again. No, we don't want to see you again. And you, don't ever come to places like this. I'll hit you if I see you here. I won't, I'll go to... - Say that again? - What did you say? - I'll go to Café de Coral for breakfast. - You're mean. I'll leave you two to it. We're leaving. - What do you want to drink? - Manhattan. - You? - Me? - Beer. - Oh, yes. Many of our business partners like to come here. You should come often and socialize. You can learn a lot. - I seldom come to these... - Kid! Are you courting her? Hey, don't scare him. Haven't seen you for a long time. Where have you been? Busy dating? No, he is my colleague, Mr. Shih. Mr. Chen. - I'm fine, thank you. - You have a chat. I'll go over to say hello. Go. Szu Szu is over there. - She seems alone. - Of course. Her man is now with you. - Let's go and tease her. - Okay. Excuse me. You look familiar. You look like my ex-girlfriend. Szu Szu, this is Jenny. Ex-girlfriend. That's why you are alone. Let me introduce my ex-boyfriends to you. - You... - I've chased away your admirer. The tall strong man insisted that I bring you this flower. - Are you guys talking? - Looks like it... - You've broken up with him? - Hey! It's good to still be friends. - She has broken up with you? - No. - She had to hold on to you first. - Hey! Nonsense. I don't need her. Many ladies are after me. Hear that? Many ladies are after him. - Where is your place then? - Jenny, I love you. I really love you, Jenny. Bastard, you better watch out. Jenny! Talk after you treat your eyes, you blind! - Sorry. - It's alright. - I should thank you for your help. - That's easy. I'm hungry. You know what to do. - Let's go to a Japanese Restaurant. - Okay. - Pig's blood congee. - Thank you. You need chili sauce for this. - Do you want some? - Oh, no. Are you used to eating here? When I was a child, my sister often took me for congee. - But the food here seems better. - Is that so? Have some more then. Boss, two more please. Okay. It's so delicious. I'm home. Darling. You sleep like a dead log. Hey! Darling, what's this? It's like this. A camera? It's a sketch. It looks nice. I'm thinking of moving the cupboards and this table over there. I'll put a floor light over there. It will look like this photo. Comfortable, isn't it? Yes. Let's buy a rocking chair and put it over there so we can watch TV on it. No, it can only fit one person. Where am I going to sit then? I'm thinking I'll be the only one. I didn't buy this tie for you. I've never seen it before. Yours is here. Why did you change it? My boss bought it for me for meeting clients. Is mine not presentable? What's so special about this tie? How much is it? It's over 400 dollars. It's 400 dollars for a necktie like this? I could get 20 neckties from the market with that money. She paid for it. Is it? From now on, you should wear everything that doesn't look presentable. So she'll buy everything for you. - Should I wear yours too? - You'd better. - I share your views on that. - Right. This year's jewelry business is better. - Right. - Excuse me, I'm looking for a friend. - It's okay. - Please. Thank you. What are you doing? My dress, somehow I feel my chest area is slipping down. It's designed that way. Come on. Hi, you're here early. - Yeah. - Allow me to introduce. He is the superintendent of Asian Jewelry Company, Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu, nice to see you. - Mr. Shih is my assistant. - Nice to see you. Mr. Shih's sister, Ms. Shih. - How do you do, Ms. Shih? - How do you do? Please continue. Let's dance. Okay. Ms. Shih, have something to drink. - Oh, thank you. - Where are you working at? I'm not working. - Let's have some food. - Okay. - I don't know how to dance. - It's okay. - What do you think about Mr. Lu? - Not bad. Do your sister has a boyfriend? - No, why? - Look. - You must be joking. - No. - Mr. Lu doesn't suit her. - How do you know? - Try the caviar. - Thank you. - Sir. - Yes. Can you steam this or add an egg? I can't take it raw. Thank you. How can they serve raw food? What if it causes food poisoning? Who's Shih Chin Shui's sister? I don't know her. She requested to add an egg to the caviar and steam it. Just look at Shih Chin Shui. He's a bootlicker, so is his sister. Thank you. - Do the food suit your appetite? - Not bad. Why not add some rice or noodles? No need. Please add a fried egg. - What? - Are you new? Don't you understand? Add a fried egg on it. - Hurry up, please. - What are you discussing? Why don't you add an egg too, Shui? Yes, do you want one? You'll feel fuller. It's nice. Let me finish and have another plate. You're better off now, so you invited me for dinner to show off? What? Today is our wedding anniversary. We didn't invite you then. We're making it up to you now. It's more important that you are happy. And that he treats you well. Yes, he does. That's good. - Switch it to another channel. - What? Can you understand what they are saying? Switch it yourself. Why can't I switch it? - Isn't this the remote control? - No. Why didn't you say so? - You like it? - Yes. - Take it. - Thank you. - Look at that damn thing! - What? I'm saying she's lucky. Dad, don't teach her such language. I didn't teach her anything bad. I was just saying how lucky she is. How should we communicate then? - Hello? - Ti. Why aren't you back yet? I have an appointment. Don't wait for me. Hello? That's all. Is it your birthday today? Can't you treat me dinner on a normal day? I thought you were treating me for dinner? - Okay, make it my treat. - You said you would. You knew my dad has opened a branch in Singapore. Yes, I heard about it. He plans to bring me with him. Really? I'm going to be free then. You really want me to leave? No, I was joking. Don't be so serious. He wants me to bring an assistant along. Who do you have in mind? It means he wants me to bring someone who can take care of me. - Have you found him? - Yes. - I have. - You already found him? Really? Splendid. That calls for a celebration. Cheers. What if I tell you that you are that person? Stop joking. Are you serious? Don't tease me again. I can't stand that. If you think I'm joking, just forget about it. Do you think I can help? Can I really help? At least... You're reliable. I must teach him a lesson when he returns. How can he forget such a big day? I must beat him up. He's just too busy. You're taking his side, you deserved to be punished too. The taxi is here, Dad. Let's go. Dad, come again when you have time. Okay. Go back upstairs. Get going. - Thank you. - Hey. Head home and consider - what I've just said. - I will. Thank you. See you tomorrow. - Have you eaten? - Yes, they just left. - Who? - My dad and sister. They came? Who were you having dinner with this late? A client. Only two of you? Yes. Ms. Kuan seems to be nice to you. Frankly speaking, do you think I'm incapable and unworthy of you? - What did you say? - Nothing. - You smoke? - Just for fun. Sorry. What for? Because... Forget it. Didn't you feel that we were happier when we stayed in the wooden rooms? Is today your birthday? Can I treat you for dinner on a normal day? Your treat? How generous. - Not my treat? - Okay, your treat. No, it's my treat. - Thank you. - Why? Thank you for helping me through it all. Thank you for giving me the opportunities. Don't mention it. But... I don't think I can help you. Because I have a sister at home. I promised to take care of her all my life. I can't leave her behind. I know you can surely find someone more capable than me. You will for sure. We haven't ordered yet. Thank you. What a coincidence! - You're not working today? - It's Saturday. Didn't you have a date? - Where's your brother? - He's at home. Does he have a girlfriend? - No. - In fact... Do you know if your brother has any plans? Plans? I don't know. Is he not working well in his present job? He's intelligent and capable. I planned to transfer him to Singapore to help me. Is it? He didn't tell me about it. He turned me down. Seriously? He wanted to stay in Hong Kong and take care of you. Excuse me for saying so. Your future husband should be the one taking care of you. Don't you think this is unfair to him? Ms. Kuan, please follow me. Is this the one? Not this, a tablet. Is this the one? This is a calculator but I'm looking for a tablet. Are you looking for a calculator or a tablet? I don't know. I have a lot of important things in it. I can't do anything without it. I think it's with my sister. Really? She liked it so I gave it to her. You gave it to her just like that? Didn't you think about me? I can't do anything now, it's serious. I don't know, don't be angry with me. What do you know then? You only know how to cook and visit the hairdresser, what else do you know? I don't know anything! I know I want my husband to come back to a comfortable home and be a good wife. Are these good enough? What are you talking about? I don't have time for dinner after work every day. I'll eat whatever and rush to night school. I studied business on odd days and law on even days. I worked so hard for a better life in the future. If you're implying that I'm hindering your success, then leave! Go to Singapore with your boss' daughter! Don't assume I don't know anything. I would've left if I wanted to. If you're not so satisfied, I quit! Fine? What's the matter with you? Why do you look like that? Dad. When did you return? Just now. Where's that rich bastard? I want him to pay me back. - I need to be away. - Away? You don't have to run away just because you owed me money. - Pay me only when you have it. - It's not that. What happened? Has he got a mistress? Tell me! I'll chop that bastard up! No, Dad. What is it then? It's common for a couple to fight. Your mother and I chopped each other up when we fight. - What happened then? - We had you after. Try accommodating to each other and you're good. It's different this time. What's the difference? Tell me. I don't want to talk about it, okay? Dad, don't blame Shui. Okay. Hey, you're here. I told you to wait. He's currently in a meeting. - Mr. Shih, she claims to know you. - Yes, thank you. I need to talk to Mr. Shih Chin Shui alone. Please step out. Let's take a break. Five minutes. Okay. Sorry. - Anna. - Yes? Take them to the lobby. Why are you here? What happened? - Where's your sister? - She left. - Where? - I don't know. Tell me what happened? Stop pretending. Stay away. Take it back. I was damn lucky. - What? - You've got what you want. You can now go with the daughter of your boss to Singapore and became rich. You're so smart. - Sister-in-law. - Shut up. Don't call me that. I'm no longer your kin. I cannot believe how heartless you are. Ti sacrificed so much for you, hoping you rise above someday. Now, you're better off and you ditched her. Ti is a fool for wanting to help you for the last time. I would've chopped you up if I were her. It's my fault. Tell me, where is Ti? How do I know? She left this morning by flight and will not be back soon. Aren't you happy now? Go to hell. - Time's up. We have to go. - Okay. Hey, is this place under Mr. Shih? Yes, what's the matter? Someone ordered a rocking chair. Put it over there. - Mr. Shih, please acknowledge the receipt. - All right. Thank you. What's the matter with you? It's time to go. Dad is waiting for us at the airport. Yes, I've asked her. She wasn't in Hong Kong during that period of time. Would you check it for me, please? Okay. Leave it then. - It's late. - Why are you still here? I have to work. - You called back to Hong Kong again? - Yes. It has been one year, and she still can't be found? What can I help you with? It doesn't concern you. If I didn't transfer you to Singapore... Don't be silly. - But... - It's not your fault. It's fate. - Don't you guys need to eat? - Hey! I can leave now. Hey. I still have things to do. You go ahead. - What a coincidence. - I thought I got the wrong person. - Do you have a lighter? - Yes. I have it. Thank you. You've changed. Why not? You've changed too. How long have you been back? Over a week. How are you? Same as before. I heard you've been traveling around the world these two years. Yes. It's nice to meet more people and see the world. Right. That's true. What are your plans now? I'm here to visit my dad and sister. I'm leaving next week. You go to different places alone. Aren't they worried about you? Why would they? I can take care of myself. I have to go. Ti. I want to let you know Ms. Kuan is getting married next month. Congratulate her for me. Put me down. Bastard, you scared me. Please.
