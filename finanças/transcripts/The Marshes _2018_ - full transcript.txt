- Research is killing me. You love it. - Dad wanted me to get a good job. Mum wanted me to get married. Science was a great way to disappoint them both. - Speaking of jobs, when will you know? - They'll assess next week. - Doesn't give me much time. And it's just you or Ben huh? - Only enough money for one of us. So much for the knowledge nation. - Hello. - Oh, hey Ben. - Hey, look I know it's last minute but I've got some sampling to complete out at The Marshes and I was hoping to get a lift with you? - Yeah it is a bit last minute. - Well I promise, I won't hold you up. - I suppose we can squeeze you in. - I owe you one. - Hey I'm Will. - Oh hi, Pria. Thanks for coming on board. - I'm here to serve. - That one's good to go. - Oh yeah sweet, I'll take it down now. Undergrads. Good luck. Thanks. - So is there like, any chance of getting malaria out here? What? Okay, there are mosquitoes, it's possible. - That is possible but it's highly improbable. - Yeah it's no more likely than in the city. The Striated Pardalote. The Striated Pardalote. The Little Grassbird. The Little Grassbird. - The crow. The Australian Raven. - What no? Okay no, c'mon everyone knows that's a crow. - Oh do they? - Yeah! If it's black and sounds like that it's a crow. - All right is it a little crow or a Torresian crow? - Or a little raven maybe even a forest raven? - Alright, alright. The Greater Sooty Owl. The Greater Sooty Owl. It's like something out of Mad Max. - Yee haw! - Guys be nice. Cerberus, down. - This establishment has the most charming facilities. - Well lead on. - Nice ride. - It's not as rugged as yours. - We could swap if you like? - I don't think the university would like that. - Researcher are you? - Yeah. - Where you headed? - The Marshes. - I hear there's good piggin up that way. - Oh, I don't know about that, we're out there to work. - That's too bad. You're not involved in that water stuff are you? - Aquatic ecosystems. You could say water stuff is exactly what we do. - Aquatic ecosystems. Yeah you know I think I've heard of you guys, taking water off farmers to give to your little froggies. - We don't take water away from anyone. - Country towns are dying because of the likes of you. - That's not true. - Sure is. See, when you restrict the flow pressure can build up. Could even lead to an explosion. Relax, it's only diesel. - Fucking inbred hick. Hi. - Just the diesel eh? - Yep. Thanks. - Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah I'm fine. - That guy tried to-- - That guy was being a douche. - So all of this was cleared? - Well people have to eat. - Maybe, but the truth is, there's just too many of us. - You mean people? - Indeed. You see our species, whilst intelligent, has a naturally high propensity for stupidity. This propensity used to keep our numbers and therefore our impact quite low. - Okay. - Okay, but, the development of tool use allowed our population to increase at a higher rate than our idiocy based rate of loss. It allowed us to overcome the myriad of stupid ideas which used to be a natural check on our population growth. We are now at the tipping point where the mass of our stupidity is too great for the genius of our tool use. - Right. - Don't pay any attention to Ben's misanthropic ramblings. - We are fucked though. Are you okay? - Yeah, mozzies kept me awake. - Okay, I'm all yours. - Well we're in the dead zone, so you might as well leave that in camp. Pull those on. Grab that stuff, let's get started. - Yep. Bloody bugs. - Better get used to it. - You know what they call this in Peru? - Sharpening the knife-o? - Calling the mother-in-law. That's terrible. Ow, you little shit. Hey Will? - Yo? I need your help with a few more samples. One, two and three. - Won't you need more than that? - Cheers Will, here's to your first day of field work. - Cheers. This'll put out the fire. - Cheers. You must taste good. Thanks buddy. - Thanks. Thanks. You know the real Waltzing Matilda happened not far from here. - What do you mean real? - Well the cover story developed a life of its own but in reality the Swagman raped the Squatter's wife. - As if. - I thought he stole a sheep or something. - Nah that's what the Squatter told the troopers. Why wouldn't he have just told them about the rape? - Back then rape was, well it had a terrible stigma attached to it, people didn't talk about it. - Yeah I guess so. - Anyway the Squatter tells the troopers about the sheep and he gets them to track the Swagman for him and he tags along. And when he reckons they're close he splits off and corners the Swagman at a billabong and drowns him. When the troopers arrive and he spins them a story about how the Swagman to avoid capture jumped into the billabong. And they believe him. - Come on, there's a whole song about it. - Hmm-mm, and it's a bit suspect don't you reckon? I mean who ever killed themselves over a sheep? - Maybe he was a Kiwi? - Ever since then the malignant ghost of the Swagman has haunted remote waterways whistling his mournful song and tuckerbagging anyone unlucky enough to stumble into his watery domain. - Nice. - It's true. Don't say I didn't warn you. - PBJ? - All the way. What? - Nothing. - What? - It's like a school lunch. - Well hardly, PBJ's were all Einstein used to eat. - Really? - I've got no idea. But don't you think there's a buttload of Einstein trivia out there? - Hell I, I guess being added as a qualifier for random stuff is just one of the downsides to genius. - Yeah, that's my experience. You really care about this place. - Well it's impossible not to. I mean it's downstream from everywhere. It could just dry up and no one would even know. - Except for us. - Yeah except for us. So I reckon I caught the biggest fish today. - That's very impressive. - I thought so. It's not the size that counts, it's what you do with the data. - What's that smell? - Have you got him? - Yeah I got him. Do you know you're in a reserve? - So? - So, you're not allowed access to the reserve without a research permit, hunting is strictly forbidden and so are dogs. - We've got a permit. - No you don't. - You calling me a liar? - Nobody's calling you-- - Yeah. - I like them waders. There's nothing wrong with one more dead pig. - Yeah future generations will thank you. - You're not from here are you? - Neither are you. - Yeah why don't you get one of me smiling? I've got what I want. - How 'bout I give you what you need? - It's getting late, I think maybe we should get back to camp. - Yeah you should get back to your little tent. - No more ghost stories? - Well I don't think I could top knife wielding pig hunters. - Yep. - That's me done, I'm going to bed. - Night. - Night. Well I guess we better-- Ben? - What? - What is it? - There was someone there. Are you sure? Pretty sure. - That's disgusting. What's up? - Further proof of your people skills. - Someone's a bit disgruntled. Well I guess I did see something last night. - Should we call someone? - No I don't, I don't, I've still got... They took the camera. - We have to contact the university. - Do we? - What? - Well if we call them then they'll insist on us reporting it to the police. - Maybe that's a good thing, I don't want a couple of rednecks telling me I've got a pretty mouth. Yeah we're not in any danger. - Really? - Look it's three hours to the nearest phone coverage. - So? - So by the time the police get here they'll be long gone. - Well what can it hurt eh? - A day, a day and a half of lost data. - You're incredible you know that? - Thank you. Great! - I didn't know flying fish came inland. - Ha ha. - How the hell did they get it so high up? - I don't know Will, the ways of the redneck are an impenetrable mystery to me. - So long as my butt remains an impenetrable mystery that is all I care about. - Hah, well that depends. - On what? - Can you squeal like a pig? - Yeah seriously though, don't you think this changes things a bit? - No, no it doesn't change anything, this is all one event. They had their fun last night and now they'll be out abusing pigs. Nothing's changed. - That's me done. - Night. - Night! It's peaceful isn't it? - Yep. - You know I wish I was doing this stuff 50 years ago, before things were completely fucked. - Yeah it's a real buzz kill. - And yet I feel like there is still a chance, it's not too late. - It's a wonderful romantic notion. - Well you say that like its a bad thing. - No I like romantic notions. Come on. Oh, shit... - How do you feel? Maybe we should head back? - No Ben. - Okay, it's your show. - Yeah, it is. No more pigs' heads today? - Not this morning. - Where's Will? - Dancing with the shovel. - Oh. - Speaking of which, I don't think it's a good idea for you to get involved with a student. - What? - Well Will is a student and, fraternizing with the student body is frowned upon. - What? - Those are the rules. - What rules? What are you even talking about? Are you saying-- - I'm saying the university has rules and you should be careful. - Wow, when did you become so bitter, huh? - I'm not bitter, cynical perhaps but not bitter. - I don't know what happened to you. - What happened to me? - Yeah. - So where are we sampling today? - We... I, uhm... I won't need you today Will, I'm just doing my water samples so you can help Ben out. - Okay. Cool. Don't get lost. I never do. - Let's do it. - I know someone's out there. It's not funny. Hey Pria, how did you go? - The hunters... Listen I've got enough data for my reports. - Great. - All I'm waiting on for your samples and then we can leave. - Oh well you know my sites are pretty spread out, so. - How long Ben? How long Ben? - Another couple of days. - I don't have another couple of days. I know you only had water samples for three sites to get, Ben. - What? - I've read the subcommittee briefing notes. Besides those what else can you possibly have to do, huh? - Well, I mean to complete the entire program I'll need at least another couple of-- - How long Ben? - Theoretically I-- - Jesus! - In the morning. - Night. Let's just finish the sampling and get going. - We'll be back in an hour. - Okay. - Sounds like they got one. - Yeah it'll keep their minds off of us. Ben? Ben? - Will what? - Are we lost? - We're uh, temporarily geographically misplaced. - Well I thought you'd said you'd been here before. - Many times. - Eh, so how can we be lost? - I don't know. - Are we really lost? - Yes, we are really lost. - And what about this? - Pig must have put up a hell of a fight. Pria will be happy. Cerberus. - Run! - Where have you guys been, you were due back hours ago? - It's all fucked up! - Something chased us. - Chased you? - Yeah. - Did you hear the whistling? - What? - Whistling? - Yeah like the, the... Ah never mind. - We found this. - Oh where? - Well they dropped it during the hunt. It's lucky it's waterproof. - Are the photos still there? - Dunno. - Oh yeah they are still there. There's a video too. - I hope I'm not about to see pig raping. Stick it in his squeal. - Now I hear it. - It's not possible. No way. Shit! - Quick! No no no! Shit! Fuck, he was just... This is a bad dream. - Come on. Shit. Go. Go! - Who, who would do that? - It's not possible, it's just a story. Right? Right? - What, yeah yeah yeah. - We have to get back to the camp or a road and get outta here. - It's just some nutcase who heard the story and, and-- - And we have to fucking tell someone. Yeah we fucking will. Come on! Pria! - Come on come on, come on, come on, come on, yes. It's okay, it's okay. - You're safe now, ssshht, sssshht, you're safe now. You have to be quiet. We are going back to camp, you can come with us. - It's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming. It's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming. It's coming, it's coming! It's coming, it's coming, it's coming! It's coming, it's coming, it's coming! It's coming! Where'd she go? - No fucking way. - We have to go, Ben, come on. - Pria, I'm sorry. - It's okay none of this is your fault, but, I don't even know what this is. - No, I mean, I'm... I'm really sorry for everything. - It's not important now. - I need to take a shit. - Now? - Yes, now. - Really? - I think it's that left-over stew I ate for breakfast. - Don't go too far. - I'll be danger close. - Are you done yet? - Oh give us a chance. - Sorry. Ben? - What? - Ben? No, he's got Ben. Shit. Pria! - Ben, Ben! Ben! Hang on! Oh god, oh! - Ah fuck shit. - We need to get him down. - This is terrible. What? - Before it gets back. - We're gonna get you down. - Please just hurry... - We're trying Ben. - Well try harder. - It won't unhook. - Just cut it, cut it. - I don't have a knife. - I don't, I can't find one. I don't have a knife Ben. You have to hide. - We, we're not leaving you. - Do an ambush. - Oh, oh... - I'll call out and then you club it, and then and then you get me down. - Okay, got it. - Okay. - Okay. Go go! Will, no! - Now, now! No, no no please, please no! - Will? Oh Ben! No no no. Ben... - Pria! Oh thank God, I thought that... All right, Ben? - He... I don't know what's happening. None of this is possible. - We should-- We can't stay here. - We should stay out in the open and fight. - We can't fight this thing Will. Oh, well then we... - Listen he's feeding now. When he's done he'll come out to feed again. That's what he's doing, feeding taking us one by one until we're all gone. We run, we hide and we hope we find our way out. - Oh, in this labyrinth? - Yeah unless you have any better ideas? Okay we need to follow a constant bearing. Until we intersect an area we recognize alright? - Yeah. Hey what's up what's up what's up? Oh fuck, even I know that's not normal. - Must be a lot of iron in the soil here. - Yeah, yeah that must be it. - Okay, I'll get a rough north from the sun and then go from there. All right, so that's our north, we head south towards the camp or the road. We've got got plenty of sites out there okay, we're bound to run into something familiar. - Yeah or a psycho dressed as a Swagman who likes to put people in his tuckerbag. - Yeah, or that, come mon. - Circles. - What? - We're going in circles, this is the clearing that we left from. - No that's not possible. - That's where we left from. - Look, look we don't have time for this. Okay, well we just looped back without realizing, it's easy to do when you're tired, come on. We're back and that was quicker than before. - No! We've got to get outta here. - Pria, Pria! - Oh my God please tell me you didn't-- I didn't touch it. - Okay you stay here. - What? Oh my God... Come on, come on! Oh my... It's like a trap. We're in a loop. - It's time to go. - Yeah, well this time we're not coming back. Right, go! - I hope it's that easy. Come on. It's just gonna keep coming after us isn't it? That's why we have to keep moving. - If we, if we could find a distraction, yeah, we could use that to help us get away. - Yeah. Scent. - What? - Scent, I think he smells us out. Rub this on you. Come on. - Fuck! - Fuck fuck fuck. Here, oh my God. Listen, the less you move the better, okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Just, okay, okay. Okay, ssshht, okay. Come on! - Stop. - No, come on. - Ridiculous. - What? - We're too slow, he's gonna catch us, he's gonna catch us. - I'm not leaving you Will. - Well hide me. - No. - Too late, we gotta hide, we have to hide. He's not real, he's not real, he's not real... No, no, no, no, no! She's over here. Look she's over here. Quick she's here. - You had us all worried but you'll be all right. - No no! No help, help!
