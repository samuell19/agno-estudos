♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (dog barking in distance) Dan? Dan, you old horse thief, where are you? (Chuckles ): Morning, friend. Where's Dan? Dan? Yeah, Dan Riley, the fella that owns this place? Oh, him. He lit out for parts unknown. Lit out? Yeah, I guess with the game disappearing like it is, there just wasn't enough in it to keep him interested. Something we can do for you? Yeah. I got a little dust I'd like to get weighed. Maybe you can check the mail, see if there's a letter for me. Name's Dillon. Matt Dillon. Sure thing. (Clears throat) CLERK (chuckles ): Well, what you know about that? I got one right here. Matt Dillon, Esquire. Heh. Sure does look like it's been a time getting here, don't it? Now, let's have a look in that poke, friend. We'll just call it postage due on that. All right, come on out of there. Oh, please. I'm not armed. What are you doing here, mister? Don't shoot. Don't shoot. They just kept me alive to cook and fetch. What's your name? Fraley. Jim Fraley. I came here with a surveyor three weeks ago, and they just killed him. They must've killed Mr. Riley, too. I'm not surprised. Did you ever own a store, Fraley? No, sir. Well, you own one now... 50%. The other 50% goes to Mrs. Dan Riley. You'll find her address back there in that ledger. Yes, sir. Just remember one thing... I'll be back this way. Those books better be in order. Dan Riley was a friend of mine. Yes, sir, you bet. (Birds chirping, dog barking in distance) (Whistling) (Cattle lowing) (Men shouting) (Whistling) (Tail rattling) (Neighing ) Mother! (Grunts) Tomas! Hyah! Sí! (Man speaking rapidly in Spanish) Oh, hush up, Tomas. You sound like an old woman. Besides, it wasn't my horse's fault. Mom, if you can't handle Spitfire, I can have Eduardo saddle up Granny for you. Thank you, young lady. I can handle Spitfire just fine. Didn't look like it from where I was sitting. (Gunshot) When am I gonna teach you that appearances can be deceiving? (Men shouting in distance) Give it to Cook Swag. Now, back to work, everybody. Fun's over. (Groans) Señora! Ah-ah! The leg will be fine in a little while, but, uh, what if this had been your neck? Meaning? Meaning there's no need for you to ride with the men. If anything should happen to you, who will take care of la señorita Beth? Why, you would, of course. Why do you think I kept you around here for 20 years for? Certainly not for your cooking. Beth loves you like a father. She's a very headstrong young woman, much like her mother. Tomas. It's true. She has much to learn. And this fine place you've built for her, what is going to hold it together if you're not here? For once I'm way ahead of you, Tomas. I wrote a letter to a man I knew a long time ago. I asked him to come here. He once risked his life to help me save this ranch. Señora, I've been with you for 20 years, and... I don't see such a man. Well, it was before your time. Before 20 years? Uh-huh. And with one letter, you expect him to come? I don't know. When did you write this letter? Four or five months ago. Four or five months? He still is no here? And still you expect him to come? If he's alive, and if the letter reaches him, he'll come. MIKE: I don't know if this letter will ever reach you, Matt. It's a voice from the past, from someone whose life you once saved at great risk to your own and for whom you had, I think, some small measure of affection. Where will you go? Oh, I don't know. Some place, find work, I guess. Must be lonesome, not knowing who you are, where you come from, why you were shot at. Guess you think on it. Yeah. I been thinking on it, all right. You're almost well now. Yeah. That means you either got to go, or... or make up your mind about staying. You mean I got a choice? I guess so. You don't know who you are, or where you're from, and maybe you never will. I don't think you're married, so that solves one problem, but you sure are something. You got a way about you, tells me, whatever you did, you did with authority. I like that. I like you, too. I tried not to, but... That a proposal? You can go straight to hell. Mike... I'd like to stay. MIKE: Many things have happened since you left, one of which may be of real concern to you. Return if you can. With warm remembrances of days gone by, Mike Yardner. (Loon calling) (Dove cooing) (Groans ): What the...? (Horse neighing) (Panting) (Shouting in native language) What's your name, son? MAN: Name's Nachite. He was after your horse and your Winchester. I figured that. Who are you? Name's Brighton, Chalk Brighton. Gold miner, trapper. As of the moment, Chief Scout in the employ of the United States Cavalry. I'll take that little cub from you now. You point that rifle in a different direction, we'll talk about it. (Chuckles) (Horse neighs) What do you want him for? I figured Geronimo sent him and his little brother to round up reinforcements. We got the little one already. You mean Geronimo is on the loose again? We figure, him and his brother split off from him when he took off into Mexico. But Geronimo ain't the one that's causing the trouble. Who is? The War Chief, named Mandac. Folks around here call him Wolf. (Neighing) Been burning and looting up north. You headed that way? Uh, no. I got business down south of here. My name's Dillon. Not Matt Dillon? The marshal that put the lid on Dodge City? A few years back. (Chuckling ): What do you know? Matt Dillon. Well. Well, come on. We'll round up your packhorse and make us some coffee. There's fresh water over yonder. Come on. (Chuckling) Easy there, Hiawatha. Don't get any bright ideas. (Sighs) Let me ask you something, Brighton. You knew that young warrior there had me in his sights. Why did you let him chunk the rock at me? Well, the truth is, I didn't know you from Adam. I was kind of interested to see what sort of aim the boy had. Any closer, he'd have taken my head off. (Chuckles) Well, look at it this way. That boy is shirttail kin to Geronimo himself. His grandson, if I got it right. If he'd put that rock where he'd wanted to, at least you'd have been murdered by quality. You never did say what you was doing down here in the territory. Well, I don't know it's any of your business, but I'm looking for a lady, name of Yardner. Yardner? What's your business with Mike Yardner? Personal. Why, you know Mike Yardner? It's a mite more than just knowing her. Me and Mike Yardner's got us a sort of understanding. If I didn't have to get this one back to headquarters, I'd ride on down there with you... just to make sure you don't get any fancy ideas. Her being a widow woman and all. Well, I'm sure she'd appreciate your concern there, Brighton. She still live down by the river? It ain't but half a day's ride. Dillon, there ain't much chance that Wolf has worked his way this far south yet, but it don't hurt to be careful. Tell Mike to keep her eyes peeled. Yeah, I'll tell her. (Whooping and distant gunfire) TOMAS: Horse thieves! You dogs! (gunfire and whooping) (Whooping and gunfire) (Shouting in native language) (Gunshot ) (yells) (Horse neighs) (Whooping recedes) (Flames crackling) Mike! (Pitcher shatters) Mike! (Gunshot) Mike. (Gasps) Damn them. They headed south, over the mesa. South? Mike, hold on a minute here. What do you think you're doing? You said they went south. That means they're headed for Mexico. I don't understand. The Walker ranch is right on their path. Beth went down there this morning. She'll run straight into them, on her way back. Who's Beth? She's my daughter. Let me go. Where is this ranch? It's six miles down the valley. All right, they were running a bunch of horses. Maybe I can get there ahead of them. Matt! She's all I've got. (Whooping in distance) (Whooping) (Panting) Hyah! Yah! Yah! Yah! (Whooping) (Grunting) No! Let me go! (Speaking native language) No. (Speaking native language) (Grunting) Geronimo... (speaking native language) (Birds chirping) (Shouting) Help! Help me! (Nickers) (Bird chirping) (Grunts) (Horse whinnies) (Grunts) (Hooves galloping away) (Chickens clucking) (Cattle lowing) (Horse neighs in distance) (Galloping horse approaches) What happened? I didn't get there in time, Mike. One of the Apaches rode off with her. Oh, my God. Now, look. She's not hurt, and she's still alive. This is what you've got to remember. What are we going to do? They're going to be taking her back to their village. We're going to need the Army. You know, I met a fella out here this morning. He said he knew you. A scout... Chalk Brighton. He's stationed at Madera in the next valley. Get you something to eat. Mike. That letter... Why did you send it to me? It's... Beth. I told you she was my daughter... but I wrote that letter on her 21st birthday. I thought it was time she knew who her real father was. You saying she's my daughter? Yeah. Why did you wait so long to tell me? I don't know if I can make you understand, but I'll try. When I fell in love with you, your whole world was bounded by this valley and this house. You'd lost your memory. This was the only life you knew... but when your memory came back, the man I'd fallen in love with, ceased to exist. In his place stood another man, Matt Dillon, with awesome responsibilities in a world... We both knew there was no place for me. (Sighs) It didn't seem decent or just to add to those responsibilities that which was... in some crazy, impossible way... another man's child. Didn't think I'd make you understand. Mike... I do understand. I tell you, you can be mighty proud of her. She was free out there. She risked her neck to come back and help me. Well, she always was a foolish, headstrong child. Oh, Lord, Matt. We may never see her again. Don't say that, Mike. We'll get her back. I promise you. How long's it going to take to get to this Madera place? Not long. We should be there by 10:00. (Baby crying ) (woman screams) (Clamoring) (Woman screams) We don't have a lot of time here! Look alive, there! Look alive! Lieutenant Davis. Sir. What are these Indians doing back in town? Well, sir, there wasn't enough room for them all on the train. What do you mean, there wasn't enough room? Well, sir, some of these people are old and sick. Some of the younger ones have babies in their arms. There just wasn't any more room for them on the boxcars. You should have made room, Lieutenant. Now get them off the street and out of my sight. Yes, sir. Move it. Hey! What the hell is going on down here? That's none of your business, Mr. Brighton. The hell it ain't. These are reservation Indians. They're friendlies, General. Not anymore. From this day forward, until Geronimo surrenders, all Membraes and Chiricahua Apache will be considered the enemy and those captured, prisoners of war. General, that's treachery. No, Mr. Brighton, it's war, and since the bulk of the Indians are now on our hands, there'll be no further need for your services. Draw your pay, Mr. Brighton. You're no longer working for the Army. Davis. Hey, Chalk. How'd he get them to come in? (Wry laugh ): Well... first he promised them extra rations, then when they got here, we surrounded them and disarmed them. It was a very daring military engagement. We should really all get medals. Where they being sent to? About as far away as the good general can send them. Where's that? Florida. Florida? Why, they can't live in Florida. It'll break them. He wants to break them, Chalk. (Child coughing) Damn his hide. Damn all their hides! There ain't none of 'em worth spit! Mike, we keep this up, we're going to kill the horses. It's all right, we're almost there. Where's headquarters? Down the street, two-story building. See if you can find Chalk. We might need him as an interpreter for the Indians. I'll talk to the general. Where's the general's office? Uh, upstairs, at the end of the balcony. I'm here to see the general. The general's busy. Come back later. I gotta see him now. This is urgent. Mister, I'd hate to put a civilian in irons, but that's where you're going to be if you don't take your hand off this door. How long is he gonna be? We'll let you know when he's free. Mike. What are you doing here? I came here with Matt Dillon. I hear you two have met. Yeah. Well, we've howdy'd, but ain't shook. When I run into him, he said he was going to see you. Why? It's a long story, and now is not the time. The hell it ain't. What are you doing here with him? The Apache hit the ranch. They killed everybody, and they took Beth. Oh, my God, darling. Oh, Mike, I'm so sorry. When... when did it happen? Yesterday. They would've killed me, too, if Tomas and two of the wranglers hadn't locked me in the hideout. Well, what about Beth? She was at the Walker ranch. They caught her on the way home. It's all right, Chalk. Matt's got a plan. What kind of plan? Well, he says the Army has two of the Apache boys... They're related to Geronimo. He's thinking of getting the Army to trade them boys for Beth? Well, it will work, won't it, Chalk? Where is Dillon? He's in the general's office. He asked me to get you to help talk to the Apaches. Let's get on over there. Come on, darling. DILLON: I'm sick and tired of waiting out there, General. We gotta talk. Who is this man, Harris? My name is Dillon. Matt Dillon. The Apaches have abducted my daughter. I need your help. Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Dillon, but I've got a few more important things to deal with than the plight of some unfortunate, young female. General... Look. I can do no more for you than I can for the relatives of other young women who have been foolish enough to get themselves abducted out here in the last couple of years. I have no way of helping you any more than I have of helping them. Now, if you'll excuse me. You do have a way of helping, General. That's why I came here. Oh, really? You have two Apache boys locked up in your guardhouse. Now, they're both kin to Geronimo. I've got a feeling the old chief might trade them for my daughter. I'm sorry about your daughter, Mr. Dillon, but tomorrow morning, I'm going to hang those bloody young savages until they're dead, as a lesson to Geronimo. Now get him out of here, Harris. (Grunts) (Shouting) Guard! If there's ever been a less competent officer in the United States Army than you, Miles, I don't know who it is. You've had your men out in the field for months. All you've got at the moment are two Apache boys. Now, you're going to take their lives, plus the life of my daughter, just so you can get off a wire about your military brilliance? Guard! Guard! Let me tell you something, Miles. Anything happens to my daughter, I'll kill you. (Grunts) Lock him up! Come on. Open up. (Groans) (Grunts) I can't go any further. I'm not an Indian. If you were an Indian, you would walk and you would not complain. You speak English. My mother was white, like you. She was a school teacher. My father took her from a wagon train and brought her to his camp, as I bring you to mine. What? You think I'd ever stay with you? You're crazy. I'm not going another step with you. You're gonna have to kill me first. (Gasps) (Gasps) (Wolf howling) Mr. Dillon. Mr. Dillon, your wife is here to see you. It'll have to be a short visit, ma'am. I could get myself into real trouble. I understand. What happened? Oh, I got into it with Miles. He's not going to lift a finger to help us. How'd you get in here? I told the corporal the Apache abducted our daughter. He has a sister her age. They're just children. Where's Chalk? He's out back with the horses. He said he wanted to help. I figured we could use all we can get. Be glad to have him. They took my Colt, but I've got the Deringer. I'd rather not use that unless we have to. Then how? What about a, uh, fainting spell? Did you ever have one? Never. Well, now might be a good time to start. Just make sure you, uh, land close to the bars. (Moans dramatically) Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? DILLON: Get the keys, Mike. (Strained grunts) DILLON: Give me the gun. Mike, could you get my gun belt for me? It's up in the office. Now, what am I going to do with you? I won't holler, sir. Honest. I'm hoping you get your daughter back. All right, inside. All right, boys, come on out. Either of you speak English? I speak. We're gonna take you out of here. Why do you help us? You are our enemy. Your chief, Geronimo, has my daughter, and I hope to trade you two boys to get her back. (Speaks native language) (Speaks native language) Yes, we go. Matt. Matt, open this door! The way things are with Geronimo, there's no guarantee either one of us will get back. Matt, you can't do this to me. Matt! You can't leave me! Matt, please! (Door closes) Matt! (Wolf howling) (Footsteps approach) (Panting) (Horse nickers) From now on, we're in Geronimo's stomping grounds. Yeah, except it wasn't Geronimo that took her. It was a different chief. How do you know that? For one thing, he was a younger man. Another thing, he didn't look full blood. He had reddish hair, paler eyes. Wolf. Half-breed, all right. Got good reason to hate us, too. His daddy was killed in the '70s uprising. The Army hanged him. We've got to find some way to get word to Geronimo. I got an idea Nachite, here, can help us. I got an idea he could ride right into Geronimo's camp if he wanted to. We will never lead you to him. I'm not asking you to. I'm asking you to tell Geronimo what I want. You tell him we'll meet him in peace at a place of his choice. What do you say? Kyeta comes, too. No, he stays with me. If Geronimo got both of you back, he wouldn't have any reason to trade for my daughter. (Speaking native language) I go. We'll be in Fronteras. We'll wait for you there. How long? Three days. All right, three days. I will meet you at Posado Real. (Speaking native language) (Shouting in native language) (Speaking native language) (laughter) (Grunts ) (cheering) (Grunting) (Shouting in native language) Enough! You come! (Whimpers) So, Beth's yours, huh? That's right. As proud fathers go, you were sure gone a long time. Wouldn't have been if I'd known. Well, Mike didn't tell me, but I figured it was something. She don't normally take to strangers, but she... she took to you like she trusted you. Make a difference, eh, Brighton? No, no, no. No, I signed on this game for my own reasons. Such as? I was planning on marrying Mike Yardner one of these days. Still do. Figured I'd wear her down in time. Then you come along... child's daddy... heading down to Mexico to hunt Geronimo single-handed. You were stealing my thunder, Dillon. I couldn't let you get away with that. Wasn't what I had in mind, Brighton. Yeah, I figured. Anyway, I'm... I'm still optimistic. How's that? Well, hell, this game ain't half over yet. Before it is, there's a dozen ways you could get yourself killed. Maybe more than a dozen. (Chuckles) (Birds chirping) (Horse whinnies) (Dog barks) I don't mind telling you, Brighton, being in this canyon makes me feel like a dogie in a chute. I get the same feeling every time I come through here, but it saves more than 40 miles. MAN: Hyah! (Gunshots) Bodine. Colonel Bodine, if you please, Brighton. Colonel Aloysius Felton Bodine. Welcome to Mexico. DILLON: Bodine? Yeah. General Wood cashiered him back in the '75 campaign for brutalizing prisoners. What's he doing down here? Scalp hunting. Gets $100 for every Apache scalp he brings in. Man, woman or child... Doesn't matter to Aloysius. (laughs ): Not a whit, Brighton. You see, Dillon, the colonel here attacked a party of my Apache scouts last winter. Killed five of 'em. Shot 'em in the back. Well, an Apache's an Apache, right, Chalky? Who's your new friend? My name's Dillon. Matt Dillon. Well, well, well. You're a little out of your jurisdiction here, aren't you, Dillon? Badge don't carry no weight down here. I'm not wearing a badge now, mister. Used to tie my hands a little. They're free now. You're in my way. I think you better learn to count, my friend. You don't take a step unless I say different. You've got to understand, Dillon. You left civilization back there on the other side of the border. Down here, I make the rules. Now, who's this? Another scalp for my collection? Touch him, you're dead. You better listen to him, Bodine. His scalp is money in my pocket. (Gunshot) Hold it! Don't move, or the next one'll be in your eye. Tell your men to drop their guns. Drop 'em. Now, off their horses. Get off. Your gun. Ow! Now, we're going to ride out of here. One false move out of you, I'll blow your head off. If he don't, I will. Get moving. BRIGHTON: Keep 'em covered, Mike. We'll meet you down canyon. All right, Bodine, step down. You're walking back. You can pick your horse up in Fronteras. Come on, boy. Looks like you've just come into some horse flesh. All right, get moving. I'm going to look forward to seeing you again. All of you. Oh, I wouldn't say that, Bodine. You ain't got but one ear left. (Horse snorts) Is this what you want? You want to make an Apache woman out of me? Well, you can make me put on Apache clothes... and you can make me walk behind your horse, like an Apache woman... and you can make me lie with you... but that doesn't make me Apache. That only makes me a slave. When my men took you, you were not afraid. When I left you in the desert where many would have died, you were not defeated. Your spirit is strong. Your sons will walk with pride. You come with me, now. Where are you taking me? Now. (Whinnies) (Bird screeches) This is the place we will stay tonight. This is where you will become my wife. Why are you afraid of me? Shouldn't I be? I will not hurt you. You took me away from my family. You murdered my people, and you burned their homes. Don't you think that's hurting me? That is war. Who started that war? There was peace until you and your chiefs left the reservation. The reservation. Look out there to the north... as far as beyond the great river you call the Colorado, and there, to the east, as far as the land of the Comanche, the place you call Texas. All of that was ruled by the Apache from beyond memory. It was not until your people came to number ten times mine, until the soldiers came building forts and your leaders turned tribe against tribe that the killing began. Have you been to the reservation? No. The reservation is desert, and barren. Barren of green grass and sweet water. The reservation is the men gambling their days away in the dust. The reservation is the women gathering hay for the white soldiers' horses. It's my people lining up for their weekly gift of government flour and beef. Truly, my people have become beggars in their our land. I will die before I go back to the reservation. And until I die, I will live the life of an Apache warrior. I will ride these mountains, and I will kill my enemies. And I will have the woman I choose. Mike, darling, I'm in the mood to serenade the stars. What's your pleasure? Whatever you like, Chalk. Mm-hmm. (Plays harmonica) (Chuckles) What have we got here? Brand-new patron of the arts, huh? See that? Listen to this. You don't like that, huh? Well, that's-that's the very best part of my whole repertory. Now, see if you like this now. Let's see here. (Plays melancholy tune) ♪ ♪ (horse snorting) Well, looks like Chalk's got that boy's interest, doesn't it? (laughs) That's 'cause he's never grown up himself. DILLON: He's a pretty good man when the going gets rough. I can vouch for that. But that doesn't mean he's grown up. Well, I don't know. He's pretty serious. He's talking about, uh, wanting to marry you. (laughs) Would it bother you if he did? You going to? I've told him no a dozen times. Well, uh, ladies been known to change their mind about such things. Well, I... had it in the back of my mind, when Beth got married and went away from home. Hard to think of having a daughter at home, much less one of marrying age. Makes me realize how much I've missed. And what she's missed not having you. You've done a great job with her, Mike. Does she have a young man? Oh, just about every boy for 50 miles around is in love with her. But no one special. She's the prettiest girl in the territory. I'm not surprised. (laughs) (Wolf howls) Huh? Oh. (Horse neighing) Well, why not? (Continues playing melancholy tune) (Speaking native language) (Horse neighing) (Distant talking and laughter) Geronimo... (speaking native language) (Dog barking) You wish to see me? Nachite bring news. He and his brother were captured by the white soldiers, taken to the prison, but a white man broke them out and brought them to Mexico. Why would a white man help two Apache boys? Because he wants the white woman you have taken. He will give me Kyeta in return for her. She is mine. If he takes Kyeta back to the Army, the boy will die. He is my blood. I will kill this white man and get Kyeta back. Kill him if you wish, but not when he comes to Geronimo in peace to trade for Kyeta's life. The blue coats will hang Kyeta by the neck until his death. But is that a way for an Apache to die? So hear me, Mandac. You will deal with this white man. (Dog barking) Go. Tell this white man I will meet him here when the sun is high tomorrow. (Bell ringing) (Indistinct chattering) You gentlemen will excuse me. Where's she going? If I know Mike, she's trying to find out if this town has anything resembling a bathtub. What about the boy? Do you think we need to lock him up? Yeah. I asked him about that. He said the grandson of Great Chief Geronimo will not escape. You have his word as an Apache warrior. I'll accept that. CHALK: You remember the time I took you to Tucson on the train and we set ourselves up at the Palace, had supper brought right up to the room? Mm-hmm. (Chuckling) Yeah. I remember, you... you ordered raspberry wine. I never even knew they made a drink like that. Delicious. It should have been... Two dollars a bottle. I remember you got into a shooting scrape with one of the Earp boys before we even left the lobby. Yeah. That was Virgil. I believe it was Virgil. Never would have happened if he... hadn't been looking at you that way. You can't shoot a man for looking at a woman. I can. Would have shot him, too, if you hadn't stepped in the way. Why didn't you tell me Matt Dillon was Beth's daddy? He told you? It sort of come out in the course of conversation. I guess it's none of my business, but how in the hell did you ever end up in Matt Dillon's arms? (Sighs) I found him in the desert. He was hurt so bad, he couldn't even remember his name. It was weeks before he was well enough to tell me where he belonged. We were together just once. Then he rode out of my life and back into his own. He rode away from you, huh? Gee. When God makes fools, he sure makes 'em on a grand scale. (laughs) I think that's just about the nicest compliment I've ever had. It'll take some getting used to. I always figured Johnny Yardner was Beth's daddy. Does it make a difference? I reckon it will down the line. It seems to me you're going to have some hard decisions to make. Chalk, I'm very fond of you. Always have been. But right now I can't think of anything but Beth. (Quietly ): Yeah. (Chuckles) Raspberry wine. (Sighs) (Chatting and laughing) Hombre. (Slaps bar) Tequila. Sí. Hey, when the... when does the party start around here? (laughing) The party is now. This is a party? Hey. Uno mas. There you are, darling. (Sighs) Oh, hey. Hey, lookie there. Hey, hombre. This could be your lucky day. What you got here is a major rat problem, and I'm the man to solve it for you. No comprendes, huh? No comprendes? Okay, let me illustrate. (Woman screams ) Señor! (Men shouting) CHALK: Now, what I propose is that I spend the entire evening very vigilantly watching here, and-and every time one of those little devils shows fur, "pow!" Now, I figure, oh, maybe one free drink per rat? That strike you as fair? No, no, señor. No is good to shoot inside. To kill the rats, we use this. (Speaks Spanish) Strychnine? Sí. It kill many rats. Muy muerto. So, poison, sí. Pistola, no. Well, there's always somebody right there to take the joy out of everything. Hmm? (Door opening) Well, well. If it isn't my old friend, Brighton. (Music and talking stop) Well, Buenas noches, Colonel. Come on, come on over here. Let me... let me buy you a drink. Absolutely. First of all, though, let's... settle that matter of my horse. Oh, forget about that horse, Colonel. You're... you're well rid of that horse. You know what you ought to do? You ought to get yourself a mule. A mule? Yeah. There's only one thing you've got to be careful of. You've got to pick you one that ain't smarter than you are. (Crowd quiets) (Chuckles softly) You're always joking, ain't you, Chalk? You're going to die joking. Maybe tonight. Talk is cheap, Colonel, especially when you got all your men standing behind you. But how are you on guts? Gun or knife? You pick, if you have the guts. Well, if it's my pick, neither one. (laughs softly) (Scattered chuckles) That's what I thought. If we're talking about guts, we don't even have to get out of here. We can settle this right here. Hombre... mescal... seis. What's that? Strychnine. Poison, Bodine. Sure death. Terrible way to die. Rips the guts right out of you. What are you doing? Now, hombre, uh, revolvo the, uh, vasos, hmm? Hey. Hey, everybody, come on up here. We're going to have a little party. Come on now. Come on. Uh-uh. No... no peeking. No peeking. Hombre? Listo. You're crazy. After you, Colonel. No. No, Chalk. You first. Whatever you say. (Crowd gasps) There's five left, Colonel. I should've pointed out, the first man to drink had a numerical advantage. (Groans impatiently) CHALK: Of course, we can stop right now, if you... if you ain't got the stomach for it. (Gulps) (Crowd sighs, chuckles) Now there's four. Yeah. I can count. (Woman gasps) (Grunts) (Crowd murmuring) (Relieved laughter) I sure did hope it wouldn't come to this. (Door opens) What's going on here, Brighton? Colonel and me is just whiling away the evening. Drink up, Chalk. (Blows loudly) (Chuckles softly) (Coughs) (Wheezes, coughs) (Gasping) (Coughing, grunts) (Yells out in pain) (Gasping) (Moans) Was his game, Dillon. Better hold it. All right, get up, Brighton. Damn it, Dillon. I had him. (crowd gasping) Maybe you still do. Just wanted you to have all the facts, Bodine. You owe me one, Dillon. You have any idea what would've happened to us in here if he'd have dropped dead and you'd have gotten up off that table? Oh, hell. You're... you're probably right. I never was much good at thinking ahead. Wolf says you come. Wait here. That's Dillon. (Dog barking) Bodine's got to know. You wait. Hyah. Three years ago, last May, about 35 miles southwest of here, me and Crawford, and about a 100 men, surrounded Benito's camp. The Apache had never been attacked down here on his home turf before. It kind of spooked him. They all come in, even Geronimo. I wonder what got 'em started this time. Oh, the usual thing. The government wants them to squat down there in San Carlos. Turn them into law-abiding, civilized farmers. But your Apache brave just dearly loves to be let alone... To hunt and ride, where and when he wants to. Well, you know something's got to give. The question is where do you stand on all this, Brighton? Well, I'll tell you, Dillon... I shot 'em, shot at 'em... been shot, been shot at, going onto 15 years now. (Sighs) Some of 'em ain't much good... but some I... I count among my dearest friends. Just makes a man sad sometimes. Why? There's one thing you ought to know 'fore we get into this. What's that? That Apache brave, that Wolf... If he's harmed my daughter, I aim to kill him. I figured that. It comes to that... I ain't gonna have much choice, am I? You come now. (Speaking in native language) Chief, here's the boy. Where's my daughter? You told me that your father was dead, that he died before you were born. That's true. Then this man lies. He says he is your father. Chalk, I don't understand. It's the truth, girl. He's your father. He also lies. Do we take the word of the man who is paid by the blue coats to hunt us down like animals? Without truth, there is no trade to honor. I will keep this woman. It is hard to see the truth... but you have brought home the young warriors, and yours is the right to fight Mandac to death for the woman. Now, hold on, hold on a minute, Chief. You may not believe me and him when it comes to the girl, but there's one truth you better listen to. The new soldier chief, General Miles, has sent your people away. Away? Where to? Put 'em on a train, sent 'em to Florida. Many days travel, even by the white man's train. How do I know this is true? It's true, Chief. Many of your people have already been taken. You're badly outnumbered by the blue coats. Let there be peace between you and I. I'll take my daughter back, and I'll tell the general of your deeds. We have heard such words before. They mean nothing. I must send to San Carlos. We must know if what Brighton says is true. I will never give up, no matter what the Army Chief has done. (Shouting in native language) (Gunshots) What's going on? Scalp hunters. Bodine, probably. He must've followed us up here. Stay. You run, I will find you... and if you come between us, I will kill you. Get up here. No, not that way. It's a trap. Go this way. (Grunts) (Grunts) (Woman screaming) (Grunting) (Screaming) (Grunts) (Gunshots) (Gunshots in the distance) (Grunts) (Gunshots) He's been hit. Can you ride? I can ride. Take her out of here. (Whinnying) (Clicks) (Grunting) (Screams) (Groans) (Sighs) (Coughs) (Coughs) It's all right, Chalk. It's all right. It's going to be all right. Get some water, girl. Bodine? (Groans) (laughs ): Well... that... that helps. It does, for a fact. (Coughs) (Grunts ): Pretty soon... somebody's going to be coming down that hill, cutthroats or Apaches... One or the other. (Coughing) Either way... you can't stay, and... and I can't go. That's the hard truth, and you know it, Dillon. (Coughing) Here. Easy, now. (Gasps) Get mounted, girl. Do like he says, honey. That's your daddy talking. You take care of Mike... hmm? Now get the hell out of here. (Whinnying) I guess I'm lucky. Apaches... don't take scalps. (Coughs) (Birds chirping) Oh, it's all right, honey, you're safe now. Chalk? You both need your rest. There's no time for that. Why? It's Wolf. If he's still alive, he's going to be after us. Put some things together. We'll head back to Madera. By the way, your daughter showed some real sand there. Well, what'd you expect? She's a Yardner, isn't she? She's also a Dillon. Or so I've been told. You've been told correctly. Now, come on. MAN (shouting ): B Troop, present arms! (Man shouts orders) (Wind whistling) (Bird screeching) (Whooping) (Shouting in native language) (Gasping) (Shouting) (Crowd murmuring) (Chickens clucking) Whoa, Whoa. (Horses snorting) (Cattle lowing) General Miles put out the news on the telegraph. He accepted the surrender at Skeleton Canyon two days ago. I got all the fixings for a celebration. I want to thank you for coming after me. It was very brave. You were the brave one. Me? I was scared to death. He never really hurt me, though. I think everything he did was his way of testing me. And in the end, he showed me respect. I understand. I... I don't know how to say this. His men killed Tomas and the others. They tried to burn down this house, and they probably would have killed mother, too, if they could have found her. I should hate him with everything that's in me, but... I can't. What's wrong with me? There's nothing wrong with you, girl. There's a war going on out here. Terrible things happen to people in wars on both sides. He told me he would die before he went back to the reservation. That he would live the life of an Apache warrior... and that he would kill his enemies to the end. Is this the end for him? Pretty close to it, I'd say. Thank you again for helping me. Beth? I'm not too handy with words, but if the Lord asked me what kind of daughter I wanted, I'd sure know what to tell Him. I'm real proud of you. Lieutenant Davis? That's me. My name's Dillon. I, uh, understand you were a good friend of Chalk Brighton. Friend, yeah. Chalk Brighton was the finest scout that this Army ever put into the field. He raised me. He raised me just from a pup. He taught us all. You can just ask any shave tail, any sergeant, he'll tell you the same thing. "Friend" hardly says enough. Salute. Lieutenant, I'm looking for information. Were you at Skeleton Canyon the other day when Geronimo surrendered? Mr. Dillon, I happen to be the aid to General Nelson A. Miles. My presence is mandatory at all such occasions. My duties included bringing the pen and ink so that the old chief could make his mark. There's a young Apache chief, name of Wolf. Was he at Skeleton Canyon? Was he there? Well, he was a bit late for the ceremony, but he was there in enough time to throw a war lance that almost landed in General Miles' mess kit. Then he high-tailed it out of there. I think he headed up for the valley. Yeah, he was there all right. Lieutenant, I thank you. (Horse neighing) (Bird screeching) Don't be afraid. I'm not. In another day, I would have taken you for my own. But my people and our ways have been swept away. In all the world now, there is no good place left for an Apache. So I have come back to give you this. So you will remember. (Gunshot) No! MIKE: Beth! (Groans) Get away from him! No, Mother, no! No, no! He wasn't going to hurt me. He only came to say good-bye. MIKE: Oh, my God. We better get him up to the house. No! (Panting) (Horse snorting) Where are you going? The place I showed you. It is a good place. (Horse whinnies) (Thunder rumbles) (Thunder rumbling) (Thunder rumbling) (Horse whinnies) (Wind whistling) (Thunder rumbling) (Cocking gun chamber) (Wind whistling) (Thunder rumbling) I did not harm your daughter. She told me. (Thunder rumbling) (Wind whistling) (Horse whinnies) (Horse whinnies) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
