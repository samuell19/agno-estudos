Come on. - No cooking, Ben. - No problem. My barn! It's bigger than I thought. Look at this. This is amazing. - Alright. Alright. - We did it, we did it. This is us doin' it. - Hello. - Hello. I need to thank you for getting me out of that kitchen. Thank you so much. This is what we needed. This is just perfect. Found it in the loft. Figured a little sandpaper, some varnish, and it'll look... - No. You leave this guy alone. - He has so much more character like this. - Him? - I thought maybe he could live in here. Did we do the right thing? One more year in that restaurant, and we wouldn't even be together. - Good mornin', Roy. - Kathy you know what? I kept thinking to myself, the only thing that's gonna get me through this pisser of a day is a big, fat piece, of your beautiful blueberry pie. - Jeez, Roy, we are all out. - Can I get you a slice of cherry pie? No, just the milk. - Sorry Roy. - Yeah. Where? Is it on the other side? - Is it over here? - Is it... - Morning. - Hello. You the folks who bought the Dondlinger farm? Yeah. We're still moving in. Did you know the people who lived there? I did. Chicago chef. - Interior decorator. - What? - How did you know? - It's my job to know. Boy. What the... What the, what the hell is this? My... Who the fuck is... Me and my wife moved in to the Dondlinger farm. Excuse me? The Dondlinger farm, it's down the road aways. This guy's been around the farm, a little bit. I don't know if you, recognize him or anything. Maybe you could help me out with that. I just, it's a blur. I mean, what you really need to do is learn how to focus your life. - Think about where you're stepping. - That's what you really need to focus on. Let me ask you somethin'. When you came into this town for the very first time, what did you see? Nice, quiet town, nice people. Okay, nice, quiet town, nice, quiet people, that's right, and that's the way it's gonna stay. And you are a stranger. You ever hear that, it's a little saying, you can run, but you cannot hide? Yeah. I'd keep it memorized. Holy shit! My God. I'm sorry. You, you surprised me. Hello. - Pretty. - Very pretty. This is beautiful. - I, I see the house before I go. - The house? Hi, my name is Ben. I mo, I moved into the house with my wife. My home. My home. It's very nice. It's very nice. - Goodbye to you. - Goodbye. May I take your picture? - When do you think we're gonna move the crib? - I think it's charming, honey. I think it's a little creepy. - No. - No? Okay. - Good night. - Good night. - Excuse me. Are you the owner? - Well, I own the building. - Hi, I'm Ben Holland. - Okay. My background was cooking, but I have a real passion for nature photography. Moved out here, I'm gonna focus on my photography now. - Good for you. Where did you move from? - Chicago. I have some photos here. I was hoping you would, maybe consider one or two for your gallery. Yeah, well, this isn't a gallery. This is an artist co-op. You rent a stall, and you sell 'em yourself. - These are good. - Yeah. I used to live in the city, New York. What'd you do out there? Advertising photography, yeah, 25 years, jerking off clients, selling them sports cars, foot creams and then viral marketing, I got the hell out. Came back home, teach a few classes, it's really nice, peaceful. - My wife and I just bought a farm. - It's beautiful out here. It's, it's Edith. What the, what the hell is this? - You enjoy taking advantage of people? - Well, no. - I guess she's part of the land. - Shut up! Do you think this is funny? Look, take this, get out! We're done here. - Excuse me. - No, we're done here! - Do you want me to call Roy? Roy? - He's the sheriff. The sheriff! - May I ask you a question? - Do you know this guy? No. Could be Uncle Larry. - I really like that picture. - Why you takin' photos of Edith? I was just taking pictures around the barn, and she showed up. - What barn? - My wife and I bought the Dondlinger farm. Now you listen to me. You stay away, from that poor woman. Do you have any idea what she's been through? Do you? You don't even know. You big city folk, you come in here and make trouble, and you don't care about people. - Well, we care about people in this town. - How dare you? - She vanished in the storm? - Yeah, it was tragic. The police, the state patrol, the whole town showed up looking for her. They searched for days and never found her. And she was eventually pronounced dead. Then, 7 years later they find her, wandering down Main Street, in the middle of the night stark naked, in a trance. She can't speak. This, made the state papers. They eventually had her committed to an asylum. Rumors were her parents or someone in town abducted her and hid her away doing God knows what to her all those years. It was a dark time back then, neighbors suspecting neighbors. Whoever did this might still be livin' today, on your farm. My Gosh! My Gosh. My God. - Hi. - Hi. - How'd it go? - What? - The gallery. - Yeah. It went great. Owner said he was busy, though, so it might be a bit. - Yeah. - How are you? - I'm great, yeah. - Great. Alright, I'm gonna go out to the man barn. - Enjoy. - Okay. - I love you. Bye. - Bye. I love you. - Well, sweet piggy! - Look at you, Farmer Brown. What the hell are you doing out here, you son of a bitch? Get in the car! - But I thought you wanted... - Get in the car! Car! - Jeez! - Come here, what's up? - Look at you. - No, no, no, look at you. Well, I do what I gotta do. I came up to hit a quick 18 with Cal from Bon Appetit. - You're golfing now? - Listen, whatever it takes, you know. - Some of us have real business to tend to. - Alright. All the reservations are low. People won't say it directly, but they miss you. And I'm trying to make ends meet right now, and it's, it's embarrassing. It's not the same without you. Listen, you're a culinary genius. Everybody knows that. I just couldn't get out of that kitchen, man. It's like 90 hours. - That's crazy. - Yeah, but the kitchen, that's where the magic was. I mean, listen, I'm gonna do whatever it takes to convince you that's where you need to be. Lydia! Beautiful as ever. It was our decision, okay. - So that's how it is? - That's how it is, man. Come on. I'll see you. Don't worry. You saved my life. Hello? Hello! This isn't funny! Where are you? Where are you, man? Get out here. I saw you. This isn't funny! Holy shit. What the fuck? What the fuck is going on? - I told you. I don't want to see you here. - I'm not here to cause any problems. Listen. No, I'm not. I am sorry if I offended you the other day, but I have a photo question. Right, well... - Where did you take this? - At the farm. - Where on the farm? - In the field behind the house. - Now I set the camera up at 1/1000th. - no, there's no way. This image was not taken at 1/1000th of a second. - Why? - Because it's blurry! It wouldn't be this blurry, at that fast a shutter speed. - It would have to be... - Well, how... How would you explain this image, if the shutter speed was that fast? He'd have to be going 100 miles/h, at least. So you're telling me this is impossible? You're saying that this image is impossible at that speed? Yeah, yeah, it's impossible! You made a mistake. You made a mistake! ? Me ? ? My God ? ? Me ? ? My God ? - Ben, you promised. - No, no, baby. You weren't in our bed last night. - I was working. - You promised. Lydia, wait. Wait. - You okay? - I'm just tired, alright? - Yeah, I'm familiar with that line. - What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. - Just take it easy, chef. - I moved out here for you, didn't I? What else do you want from me? I haven't been completely honest with you. I need to show you something. - He's gone. - He's there. He's gone. I have no idea what I'm looking at. Him. Look. - He's not there. - He's there. Then he's not. I took those pictures a second apart, Lydia. I can't explain it. I... This is what kept me in the barn last night. Lydia. I think it's, I think it's a ghost. - Can we just be serious, honey? - I'm, I am serious. - I'll prove it to you. - Come on. We're gonna go out in the field. I'm gonna show this to you. Come on! It's not there, I... Shit! I don't know why it's not working, but... - Come on Ben, it's getting cold. - Just, just wait, okay. Shit. I don't know why it's not working, but there is something odd out there in that field. - Ben. Ben! - What? I haven't been entirely honest with you either. That's the guy from the gallery. - I hope we did the right thing. - We'll be okay. - The sheriff's here. - What? Come on. - Good morning. - Morning, Sheriff. - Ben, ma'am. - How you doing? Folks have some real pretty dirt out here. - Thinkin' about doin' any farmin'? - I doubt it. - We just, like the space. - It's, it's nice to be able to spread out. Well, what made you consider Manitowoc County? We just found the town to be, omfortable. - Can we do something for you, Sheriff? - Yeah, Ben I got to ask you a question. What were you doin' with Edith Millard out there, in that field the other day? I was just out there taking some photos, and she walked... - Yeah, George told me that. - Kathy said you came in and talked to her. Charlotte Waite said you were in the library, lookin' up all the old stories about her. Now what's that all about? Well, I just heard things, and I wanted to find out what the big deal was. Yeah, well the big deal is Edith Millard spent most of her adult life in a sanitarium alright, in Windy Ridge. Now she lives peaceful, quiet and safe in that little cottage by the edge of your property back by the old field out there, and that's the way we like it. Everybody in town likes it that way, and we want to keep it that way. So don't come in here thinking you can publicize her story, just to make a quick buck, alright? Are you accusing me of something? Listen, people in this town went through hell, when that little girl disappeared. Some of those folks are still here and their kids and their grandkids. You've been warned, son. No more of this Edith Millard nonsense. - Don't make me come back out here. - I just took her picture. I... What are you doing? What are your secrets for apple pie? Do you have any? Son of a bitch! You leave Edith alone. I haven't done anything to Edith. I'll get you some cough drops for your cough. They taste good, too. Wanna hold hands? Hit it hard. Shut up! Come on, go, go! Run fast! Run hard, down the well, with Edith Millard. Run fast, run hard, down the well, with Edith Millard! Down the well with Edith Millard! - Edith! - Down the well with Edith Millard! Run fast, run hard, down the well with Edith Millard. Pretty sure you're breaking the law. A lot of folks would love to know what you're doing out here. I would like to know, what you're doing out here. - How much do you know about this place? - Not much. The more I find out about it, the weirder it gets, though. What do you mean weird? Well, I found out what happened to Edith, and the sheriff. And I'm taking pictures of people that aren't there. What do you mean? Who's that, and who's that and that and that? Well, one second, I'll take a picture with nothing. The next picture I take, someone's there. And then the second after that, they're gone. Don't mention this to Roy. There's a lot of memories out here, some good ones, bad ones. I made a few myself. - If I was you, I would stop it. - I'm just taking pictures. I said if I were you, I'd stop it. I'm not calling about work, Kenny. I need you to be straight with me, man. Are you playing a joke on me? Are you playing a practical joke on me, you know, to get me back to Chicago? Because I gotta tell you, it's, it's not funny anymore, man. Now what's up? What's going on? You're not messing with my camera, you know, putting images there that shouldn't be? No, I'm not playing any games. Let me just make this clear. I am not coming back. But if you are messing with me, man, I'm taking the next fuckin' train down there and I'm gonna kick your ass. - It's not funny, man! - This ends now, got it? Well, the site of your farm is where the original Fort Jackson stood. It was built for the Black Hawk War in 1832. But lots of strange things happened there. - Like what? - Well, here's my favorite story. In your field, there was a deep, deep well, and people fell down and never were found. Actually, they thought Edith Millard fell down the well. But get this, Roy was the last person to see her before she disappeared, and as a young officer the first one to find her. - Well, what a coincidence. - Yeah. No, people do not like that guy. - Yeah. - What's that? It's a high- speed video camera that can take over 1,500 frames per second. - You paid how much? - I can return this. ? Alright ? - My name's Lydia. - Yes. Thank you. Ben tells me you used to live in our house. I need to be near my home. My family. We're not going to ask you to leave. My family waits for me. - Always waits for me. - Where is your family? My home, in the field, my home. My family waits for me. Ben and I are hoping to start a family. - Goodbye to you. - Goodbye. I wonder if I could, I wonder if I could come back sometime? - Yes, goodbye to you. - Goodbye. Thank you. - What's going on? - Where were you? I was just, I saw Edith. I ran into Edith. I need you to come see this. - Come on. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Okay. So I took the camera, and set it up to take 1,500 frames a second. Then I went through the frames and took out each one with him in it, and I set them up in a sequence. Now watch. Just look at that. - Is this an animation? - No, it's real. Scone. I brought you something else, too. It's from Ben. That's you, Edith. That's you. No Edith. Joonica. Joonica. Joonica. Not from here. I'm sorry. What do you mean you're not from here? I go home. Family waiting. My family. Joonica. What's in the field? Big storm. Big storm, Joonica go home. Ben, we need to tell someone about this. I think we should get more footage. More footage? I mean, how much more footage could you possibly get? We don't know what this is. Well, maybe it's not for us to figure out. I mean, maybe we should contact a scientist or something. Look at this, it's even clearer than the other ones. - Ben! - Lydia. - This is overwhelming. - We are on something big here. - This could be enormous for us, Lydia. - A haunted farm? - It's not haunted. - You're safe here. - Then why was the sheriff here? - The sheriff's an asshole. - Ben. - Listen! We shouldn't go jumping to conclusions, until we know what we have here. You know, Ben, this is just like Chicago. Long nights, late hours, we're not sleeping together. This is Chicago? This right here is Chicago? You're being ridiculous! I can't even believe you right now. Ben! Hello? Children? Where are you? I can't see you, come here! Kids! There you are. I'm so sorry about last night. Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry we're stuck with this place. It's my fault. - No, it's, it's not your fault. - We made a deal. - I forced you. - You didn't force me. You saved me. - You're saving our marriage. - You gave up a career, too. - I can't... - Yeah. I can't lose you. I won't ever let anything happen to you. I promise. Me and the baby would never forgive you. When we have a baby. - Ben. - What's this? This isn't more cameras, is it? No, no, it's, some lights, some stands, stuff we need. Stuff we need. Aren't you a little old to be hanging around with teenagers? Look, kids these days, especially in these times, they need a role model. I'll tell you somethin' about the singular point of view of the celestial spear. - God. - Yeah, it's watchin' you, from above. It sees you, and it sees what's inside of you, and you yourself have a spear and it's full. It's full, but you've got to let the air out, because love's got to come in. That's something you ain't got. That's something that you need. And the celestial spear will give that to you. - Have a seat, milady. - There you are. - Behold, my biggest fan. - Alright. What if I could tell you I could freeze time, with this and this alone? Behold. The fan is spinning at a very fast speed, and I will stop it. Look at that. At the right frequencies, I can also set this to mimic a camera shutter speed of 1/1000th of a second, therefore being able to see things that you would not normally see with the naked eye. No more dragging cameras out into the field, never needing to sift through thousands of photos and just me, my naked eye, find whatever's out there? What? Shit! - Ben! Ben, come inside! Come inside right now! - Calm down. Lydia. - Come with me right now. I saw them. - Calm down. What did you see? - Turn that off. - I didn't see! - What did you see? What is it? - Lock the doors! - Lydia, Lydia. - I saw something. - What did you see? - I don't know. - I don't know. - It's okay, it's okay. We're okay. I'm right here. Look at me. Look at me. - Come here. - Ben, I'm so scared. - Lydia. - Honey. - It's okay. - I can't have anything happen to you. - I love you so much. - I won't let anything happen to you. Come here. - Come here. - Calm down. - Ben. - What? We should set up over there. Okay. Joonica. Is this you as a girl? No, no Joonica. - This isn't you as a baby? - No. You had family? You had baby. It's coming. It's coming! - Alright, Ben, come on. - Just one more minute. - Come on. - No, let's go inside. - I'm almost set. - Ben, listen to me. Look, it's gonna storm. - Come on. - This is what we need. - It's getting dangerous. - Joonica, come on, we're gonna go inside. Joonica wait! Joonica! Lydia. Lydia? Lydia. Lydia! Where are you? Where are you? Lydia, answer me! Lydia! Lydia! Lydia, answer me! Lydia! Dammit! Ben! Ben! Ben, I'm over here! Ben! - Ben, I'm over here! - It's beautiful. Beautiful. Ben, Ben! Ben, please, Ben! Ben! - What do you want? - Where is she? Who? We found Edith's coat in that field there with your generators, and your cables and your crap. - Now what the hell did you do with her? - I didn't do anything. You know, you are one shitty liar, son. - You want to try again? - I don't know. - What? - I don't know! - What? - I didn't do anything to her! Yeah, we'll, we'll just see about that. - House is clean, Roy. - Check the barn. You mind telling me why the wife has been gone so long? - She went to her parents house. - We've been having problems. If you're having problems, why'd you buy the farm? I thought it might fix things. Things don't fix things. People fix things. Nothing. I'm gonna tell you this just one time. If anything happened to Edith, I will kill you. And don't think I won't. And don't think I can't. I got a badge, and I got a gun. People hang themselves in jail cells all the time. Get the fuck off of my car. Now! Okay, Friday, October 15th, 8:15PM, interview with one Benjamin Holland in regards to the disappearance of Edith Millard. You're comfortable, mr. Holland? You need anything, water, coffee? - I'm fine. - Okay. Alright, mr. Holland, when was the last time you saw Edith Millard? - 5 days ago. - 5 days, that'd make it about October 10th? - Yes. - And what time of day was that? It was in the afternoon like 4, 5 o'clock maybe. 4 or 5, so we're talking late afternoon, early evening? Yes. We found an article of clothing of hers, out in your field, a jacket. Was she wearing that jacket at the time you saw her on October 10th? I don't recall. She visits us a lot. And does she wear the jacket when she visits you? - You don't know? - Yes and no. - But you didn't see it at the time? - I don't recall. - People have been saying they've been seeing some strange lights, flashing things out in your field, last couple of nights. Can you explain that? I'm taking specialized night photography. I didn't realize it was illegal. Well, not yet. Where's your wife? - She went to her folks house. - Where would that be? - Chicago. - Expect her back? I hope so. Okay, let's back it up here. The last time you saw Edith Millard was roughly October 10th, between 4 and 5 p.m. in the afternoon? - Yes. You don't recall whether she was wearing a jacket that we found in the field? I don't. Or whether she was carrying it when you saw her. I don't. I don't know if she was wearing it or carrying it. I don't know. - How many times do I need to tell you? - Alright. I think we've heard enough. I'm gonna advise you not to leave town. Lydia? I am so sorry. I... I don't understand. Lydia. Please, please come back. Ben Holland, you are under arrest in connection, with the disappearance of Edith Millard and Lydia Holland. - Here, cuff him. - Wait, wait, I can explain. You have the right to remain silent. Roy, I can tell you, what happened that night that Edith disappeared. I know there was a storm. There was a storm the night she disappeared. - Yeah. - I know, I know you're not responsible. - If you do not... - I have proof! I can show you. In the barn, I can show you right now. I could show you that I know what happened. Alright. - Dammit, let go. - What? What is it you think you can show me? The more and more I worked on it, finally I figured out that not all the frames show what's happening. You can't just watch the whole picture. It moves too fast. But if you go frame to frame, that you can't look at everything. And that's what it is, because it's just impossible to see it. But when the lightning strikes, and it knocked out all the power. What is it you're showing me? I'm showing you this is, the footage that was left on the camera before the lightning strikes. Ben, what is it you're showin' me? Ben what is this? What am I supposed to be watchin' here, Ben? - The fuck is he doing? - He's fuckin' nuts is what it is. Let's take him in now. Just work. Yeah. That's it, take him. - Come on. Mr. Holland, mr. Holland! - Stay back! - Step away from the machine! - Do not, no! - What's going on here? - Don't you, what are you doing? Get off me! - Hang on, I got him. - Get off me! Turn that thing off, will ya? I can't see anything. - What are you doing? - Better shut up! Will ya turn that mother... Lydia! - Lydia. - Ben, it's you? - It's you! - Yeah, it's me. - My God. - It's alright. I thought I lost you. Hello Roy. My God. How are you, Roy? - It's me, Roy. - Edith? - Is it really you? - Yes. - Is it you? - Yeah. - Is it really you, is it? - Yeah. My God. You're so beautiful. I never want to let you go. I never want to let you go again. Let's go home. - Can we go home? - Yeah. - Yeah, let's go home. - Yeah. And look at you. - Yeah, yeah. - You're a sheriff now. Yeah, There's so much. So good to see you. We should sell this farm. Get away from the field and just start over. - No. - This is the right place, Ben. - Are you sure? - I'm pregnant. - Really? How do you know? - I saw our daughter. - You're alright? - See? - Let's take a picture. - It's picture time! - What'd you say? - What is here? There you go. We're gonna get a picture. My goodness. Get up, make sure you got that food in your mouth, right? Yeah, yes, yes. - Ready? - Okay. - Who's ready? - Take a picture. Alright. Come on. This is gonna be great.
