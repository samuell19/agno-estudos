The Carpathians, the Danube River and the Black Sea have shaped one of the wildest countries in Europe. The wealth of this place lies in the pure-air mountains, in the rivers full of life, in the healthy forests. The wealth of this place is the nature itself. The end of our story is about the time when autumn turns into winter - the season of change who brings the final challenges of the year. From the rumors of the red deer in the mountains, to the predators that roam the forest, these are the nature best-kept secrets. WILD ROMANIA THE SEASON OF CHANGE The summer heat begins to fade away and the first autumn fog envelops the peaks of the Carpathians. This is Retezat mountain- the first national park in Romania. After the retreat of the ice, glacial lakes formed in these high calderas, whose water came from small springs and rain. Bucura lake is the largest glacial lake in the country. Together with 80 smaller ones give this place a magic touch. The mountain is enveloped in gentle light and the wind brings change. As soon as it cools down, ancient sounds echo in the Carpathian valley. The sun shines less and less and the morning chill ushers in the moment, which the red deer waits for a whole year. This is the beginning of the breeding season. Males make low-frequency sounds, which spread better in the forest, but they are also strong enough for open spaces. The stronger they are, the better chance they have of attracting a female. The competition begins. The young stags stand aside because the arena belongs to the strong ones. Deer splashed themselves with urine, to seduce females. They are so excited that they could do anything. Hinds are not easily impressed. For now, food attracts them more. Red deer are so focused on mating, that at that time he hardly eats. He can lose a quarter of his weight. When the deer forms a harem, it must protect it from intruders. A young deer sniffs out the females, but it needs to be careful. The alfa male of the area does not want competition. Deers use their antlers to protect themselves from predators, but hinds are more vulnerable. The lynx is a skilled hunter and he hunts mainly by ambush. One wrong step and the hunt is over. Most hunts ends unsuccesfully. All this natural beauty wouldn't exist if we didn't protect the forests. The expansion of the forest began after the Ice age when the beech managed to take over more than half of the continent. This amazing tree creates some of the most valuable habitats in Romania. At Strambu Baiut, in Maramures (north west) there are some of the most beautiful centuries-old forests in the country. This beauty is due not only to the variety of trees but to their different ages, too. Saplings and ancient trees exist side by side in a perfect harmony. To understand the forest, we have to get into a completely different rhythm than ours. Beech seeds sprout quickly, but the fight is just beginning. These saplings wait patiently in the shade of the adults, to get more light. An unexpected ally comes to their aid. The fungus penetrates the bark and destroys the wood fibers. They produce sugars that attract insects, which will weaken the structure of the tree. One more push of a strong wind, and the whole organism will collapse. The saplings have been waiting for this moment for decades, to start competing for light. The significance of the tree does not end with its death. It still has value to that ecosystem. Its trunk is taken over by fungi that decay the wood. It becomes food and shelter for many animals. Whether they are prey or predator, everyone finds a reason to live near the dead tree. The rotting material provides the base of the food chain in this habitat and half the animals in the forest depend on it. Dead wood makes a final contribution by turning into chernozem - the fertile soil in the forest. This process is slow and it takes hundreds of years to collect one millimeter. Romania is home to two-thirds of the EU's centuries-old forests. These habitats are a real oasis of biological diversity and must be protected. In mid-autumn, another mating ritual begins in the woods. Although the fallow deer is not a native species, it has adapted to forests outside the Carpathians. It comes in more colors than the red deer, including almost pure black. The season of overdrive is approaching and the males gather to display their strength. The bigger and more spread out the horns, the better. Showing power helps impress opponents. When two stags are equally strong, there is only one way to find out who is more powerful. The battles are fierce and deers can be seriously injured. The young deer stand by and watch. They have a lot to learn before entering such a duel. When the dominant stag gets rid of all the suitors, it's time to enjoy his harem. Healthy forests are important for soil strengthening. Erosion occurs during storms and indiscriminate logging. In Apuseni mountains, at Ruginoasa pit, the largest natural phenomenon of its kind occurs. A wound 100 m deep with a diameter of over 500 m. The rain made this place. Thousands of small ravines collect water, which continues to eat away at the walls. Freezing and defrosting help with erosion. This phenomenon has been developing here for more than 200 years. The forest cannot hold the soil on which it grew and the gorge widens by a few centimeters every year. Spruce roots strengthen the soil only on the surface. Over time, they also fall victim to corrosion. Although created by water, the bottom of the canyon is dry. It fills only after torrential rain. In other parts of the country erosion and landslides have changed the landscape in other ways, by damming rivers and creating natural lakes. Nearly 200 years ago a slope collapses in an earthquake, which blocks the path of a small river and created a lake, "Lacul Rosu". The logs that are submitted are the only evidence about the forest that used to be here. Cuejdel lake appeared after a more recent landslide. Many of the trees still stand and create an unique sight. The morning fog enhances the surreal atmosphere. Lakes that form after a natural landslides are very rare, but St Anna Lake is really unique in Romania. Though only the mist is smoking now, several million years ago here there were two twin volcanic craters. One was covered by a peat bog, and in the other the lake St Anna was formed. It is hard to imagine that this picturesque landscape was once a hot lava-spewing inferno. Just the volcanic cones, the sulfur emission and the acidic water of the lake remind us of this distant past. This area is located in the southern part of the volcanic chain, which stretches over 200 km. In the middle of this chain, in the Caliman mountains, was housed a volcanic caldera with a diameter of over 10 km. The lava pillars from "12 Apostles"(Caliman mountains) remain as evidence of this past. The legacy of these volcanoes is one of the richest areas of mineral water. Romania also hides many extraordinary volcanoes. Mud volcanoes. Although this landscape has nothing to do with volcanoes, the name of the mud volcano was inspired by these cones. It is a rare geological phenomenon, which is found in few places on the continent. Hydrocarbon deposits found at a depth of 3000 m generate natural gases. In an attempt to rise to the surface, gases move groundwater and create mud lakes that are constantly bubbling. These lakes overflow and change the entire landscape. Strange and abstract world. When there is no rain, the swamps begin to dry up. The birds have to adapt to the new situation. Without water around, herons don't feel comfortable. Everyone has to adapt to the conditions. Only the sandy beach runner feels at home in the mud. The bigger the beak, the better. It is easier to reach food that is hidden underground. The only problem is cleaning the feathers with such a beak. The birds are preparing for a long migration south and all feathers must be clean and neat. Their lives depend on it, but someone takes it too seriously. The black storks that nest in Romania or in the northern part of the continent, use the opportunity to increase inventory, which they need for the long voyage. They compete with permanent residents. Such an opportunity rarely comes along, therefore each species takes advantage of the moment. Many unique landscapes are hidden in Romania. Some of the most famous are the karst plains in Domogled - Cernei valley, the largest national park in the country. The location of this place makes it easy to break into of warm and humid air masses from the Mediterranean in the valleys. That's why the temperatures here are similar to those in the warm areas of southern Romania. The rocks shelter sub-Mediterranean vegetation and preserve black pine species that thrive only in this habitat. Banat black pine. Pine leaves are evergreen like many conifers, but for most trees it is a time of spectacular transformation. Autumn colors are taking over the country's deciduous forests. Trees gradually stop the process of leaf photosynthesis, as the days grow shorter and the light begins to wane. Chlorophyll disappears when the process stops. The green is replaced by the pigments that color the leaves in yellow, orange and red. Colors fade because of light or frost. Only tannin remains in the leaves, which produces a brown color. This process helps the trees to preserve the vital substances in the trunk and ensures that resources are available to create new leaves, when the winter ends. Animals grow their winter fur. They take full advantage of the food they find. Boars dig through the forest floor in search of acorns - the most important delicacy of the season. The bears now look plump because of the impressive layer of fat they have accumulated which will help them to survive hibernation. The beautiful autumn days are coming to an end and nature is preparing for the next change. The wind is blowing stronger and carries the fallen leaves around the forest. The air is full with the smell of the winter. Soon there will be a blizzard across the country. In the Carpathians, the cold is felt more strongly than in any other region. Heavy snow covers the forest at the foot of the mountain. Everything seems frozen and lifeless. The life of birds is more difficult because the food is scarce. In these conditions it is better to conserve your strength, but this does not apply to tireless titmouses. If you know where to look, you have a chance of finding food. Masonry is predictable and has supplies in hidden places that only she knows. She must be vigilant when visiting the warehouse, for there are always gluttons who can rob the stock. In the mountains, survival depends on the adaptation of the species to harsh conditions. A female grouse eats conifer needles in this difficult time, and the male follows her example. Life in the harsh mountain conditions has led to interesting transformations. The strange beak of the common loxia helps her open a cone to reach her seeds, but now it also finds food at the base of a log. No matter how well you've adapted, you must take advantage of every available resource. Most insectivorous birds are migratory. The rest feed on seeds and fruits, Not all the animals are satisfied with vegetarian diet. Under the thick winter blanket there is a story of predator and prey being imprinted on the snow. A very skillful and intelligent animal hunts here. The food was hidden under a fresh layer of snow and the thick fog seems to complicate the situation. Who can hunt in these conditions? The voles dig galleries in the snow and seem to be safe in their refuge. Even if he can't see them, the fox hears every movement. This amazing sense helps her determine where sounds are coming from. The fox is an excellent hunter, but voles are very fast, too. The important thing is not to surrender. Thanks to the snow, the fox is almost invisible. It also has other advantages. The hunt is successful and the fox is stocked. She hides her prey in the snow. The magpies follow the fox and hope for scraps, but since the fox leaves nothing, the magpies try to find the buried vole. A bird watches intently. He saw how it goes and it's time to try it, too. When you reach the ground, you better stop. Obviously you're digging in the wrong place. The cunning fox managed to fool someone, again. Winter is long and stocks in the natural fridge are a good idea. The fox finds the hidden voles by its sense of smell. She prefers to bury fresh prey and eat frozen ones. Maybe voles taste better after sitting for a few days. Foxes travel long distances in search of food, but the birds take precedence. It's easier to find prey from above. A wild cat that died of cold. The magpies instantly see the possibility, but it is not easy to open a frozen corpse. Reinforcements are coming. Soon the whole council meets. Despite the discussions, no solution was found. This problem requires a strong beak, but what to do when the buzzard takes over? The morning temperature warms it and the carcass is easier to open. Magpies also want to eat, but they are no match for a buzzard. They have to be patient. After the bird of prey has had its fill, the leftovers are for the magpies. Food will be enough for everyone, but there are still obstacles. Despite the conditions, many animals live well in Romania. Not all species are so lucky. Zimbrul (a kind of bison). The largest land mammal on the continent, but very vulnerable. Ten years ago, the animal was found only in reserves. 200 years ago disappeared from the Romanian fauna, but was released into the wild in the natural park Neamt. After making tremendous efforts now over 100 bison roam freely in the Romanian forests. Most live here - in the Tarcu Mountains (western part of the Meridional Carpathians) In winter, when food is scarce, they feed on small twigs and tree bark. It is unbelievable that this is enough for an animal weighing almost a ton. The Bison has a fighting spirit. It is proof that it is easier to save species from extinction, rather than trying to return them to the wild. Food is scarce and winter is hard on the herbivores. On the other hand, for predators, this is the perfect hunting season. The lynx roams large territories in search of prey. He is a silent hunter. He uses speed and patience and will easily catch a large animal. The doe will be enough for him in a week, but he must be careful, because he can be pushed by another good hunter. The wolf - the most dangerous predator in Romania. Also like a lynx, it can be found on every hill and in every forest in the country. In winter, they live in a pack led by a dominant pair. It is important for them to mark their territory to keep competitors away, although such a large pack has no equal rival. In winter, wolves hunt in the valley and chase the prey to the water. The glaciated areas that complicate the movement of herbivores are a great place for an ambush. A red deer female is knocked down into the river by a pack of wolves. Even without the pack, these predators are very capable. After they are full, the leftovers are left for the birds. At the end of winter, wolves are ready to mate. They find a partner more easily because they are social animals. Cats face a greater challenge. The lynx has been alone for a whole year, and now it is looking for a mate. To find marks familiar places to make its presence known. The couple quickly managed to find each other. Even for these solitary animals it is desirable to socialize them at least once a year. Lynxes are active mostly at night, therefore, these moments are extremely difficult to observe. After copulation, they separate and each goes on his way separately. The cubs are dependent on their mother for nearly two years. During this time, they are always in the mood to play. A cat is a cat. Males do not participate in breeding. The woman has to fend for herself. She has to hunt for two. Actually for three. Mothers face many challenges, especially when they have to take care of their young. A female bear forages to replenish her fat reserves, before hibernating. She is not alone, but her two bears have other concerns. As with any child, they feel like playing right before bed. The neighbors in the forest are as angry as those in the city. Who cares about them when there are so many things to break at home? Even if in Romania there are the most predators of the entire European Union, they are hardly seen. They easily find refuge in the vast wilderness away from the human eyes. On the other hand, many of them are active mostly at night. When we go to bed the animals in the forest continue their activities undisturbed. Herbivores should always be on the lookout. You don't know whose eyes lurk in the dark. Predators roam their territory in search of food and pay attention to every clue. Pathways are shared by predators and their prey. A wild cat is looking for a partner and enthusiastically marks its territory. Of all the predators, only bears seem to have other problems. No matter how energetic you are, you will get tired sometime. We need to protect these natural wonders. National parks are only one percent of the country, but there should be ten times as many strictly protected areas. Some of Romania's natural wonders are still wild, because they are inaccessible. The Fagarash mountains are a real natural barrier. 70 km of mountain range and deep valleys with over 100 peaks over 2000 m high. Even if it is the highest and largest mountain in Romania and the second highest in the entire Carpathian chain, the place is not strictly protected. The creation of a national park in Fagaras mountains would help to extend the protection zone, uniting other parks and reserves . This way it would be created one of the largest protected areas in Europe. A wild zone which could make us proud. Such vision could be realized only if we fight for it. We still have many natural wonders who deserve to be protected. Although this story ends here, in the harsh winter in the Carpathians, we mustn't forget that this adventure continues year after year. If you have the courage to look nature in the eye, you will not forget that you are a part of this Romania. a Romania who really deserves to remain wild.
