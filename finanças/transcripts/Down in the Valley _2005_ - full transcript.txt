This right here? That's a single-action Colt .45. They've been makin' that gun since 1873, and they ain't made a single change to it. That's how sweet it is. Everyone you ever heard of, Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, all of 'em, they had a gun just like this. Now, single-action, what that means, is you can pull that trigger all day, and it doesn't do nothin'. You gotta thumb that hammer back for it to fire, and you gotta do it every time. That makes it a little tricky. So that means in the old days, those gunfighters, they had to draw and cock and shoot all in one motion. After a while, you start gettin' a rhythm with it. You want the last two? Come on over here. Now, when you're ready, just thumb her back. Just let it roll, nice and easy. Be ready, it's gonna kick a little the first time. Now this time, don't even aim it. Just point it, like you point your finger. Make it almost like an extension of you, okay? Look at that!

Why would you do that? - He was all alone, you should've seen his face. I felt so bad for him. - That's not the point, you knew that would piss my dad off! - Oh, hey. I just, I thought, I was gonna have him back before he got home, but... - Harlan, you can't just do things like that. Now it's gonna be even harder for me to see you. - October. Are you happy livin' in that house with Wade? We gotta get you outta there. - What? - We gotta get you outta there, you and Lonnie, both. We'll take you somewhere else. - Harlan, no, just stop being so-- - I'm, how am I bein'? - Just be cool, okay? - I'm cool as can be. - Look. Let's just not see each other for a while. - No, no, I don't wanna do that. - Just until he calms down a little bit. - Well, when is that gonna be? - I don't know. - Hey, hey, hey, where are you goin'? Don't go, don't go. - Harlan, I have to go home. - Look, everything's gonna be fine, okay? I'm gonna figure somethin' out, okay? I promise. What's your line, what's your line? I have a background in... Automotive service. Man, I'm a fuckin' cowboy, what's your line? Why'd I say ranchin'? But really, I'm a, I'm an Indian. Yeah, I'm an Indian. Last of the Mohicans. Why, what's your line? What's your line? Wade. Corrections? Oh, so you're a screw head. Yeah, a screw head, yeah. No, that's what we called ya. What, oh, you come from a long line of screw heads? I come from a long line of warrior... Kings. Shit. Shit. You think I'm foolin'? You see that? That's how that's gonna look comin' at ya. Yeah, who's the nobody now? - Comin' in, Harlan! Harlan, Harlan, you in here? - What's up, Renee? - Just tell me that is not a bullet hole in my window. - Mm, no, I guess it is. - Well, have you just lost your fuckin' mind? - You can't be shootin' at windows out here. Renee? - Go to your room! Both of you, go to your room! Are you fucking crazy? - What? It was just an accident, Renee, I'm sorry. - I don't care what it was. Now, Harlan, you know I like you, but you never give me any respect, so you have got to go! Don't think about it, don't ponder it, don't roll it around in that brain of yours. Just pack up your stuff and go. I'm serious, Harlan. - I'm gettin' my fuckin' shit, Renee, all right? - Last stop. Hey, buddy.

If we passed each other on the street, we might not even recognize each other to say hello. Maybe that's happened without our even sensing it. I used to wonder why you did what you did. What made you leave. But I think I see now what you were lookin' for. I hope you see that in my own way I'm after the same things. I hope this letter finds you well, though I would've liked to look you in the face one more time. The winter rains have cleared the smog out. For the first time, I can really see the trail in front of me. I'm off to a greener pasture. If you think of me now and then, wish me luck. Your loving son. Hey, sweet pea. - Harlan, what're you doing? - What? Oh, hey. Oh, gosh. - Where have you been? - Well, I've been around, I just... I had a few things I had to do. - I was really worried about you. I didn't know where you were. - I thought you didn't wanna see me for a while, so I... Well, I thought I should leave you alone. - You didn't have to disappear. I was just really upset when I said that. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - You ain't still mad at me now? Oh, gosh. Well, that's all that matters, then. As long as we're stickin' together. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I know you don't want me comin' around here, but I... I don't know, I really needed to see you, you know? I wanted to talk to you about things. - How did you even get in? - I thought I heard you round the side, so I went round and there was a door open. I didn't see your dad's truck here, so I thought I could surprise you or somethin'. - Let's go for a walk. - No, no, no, come here. Come on, no, no, come on. Come on, we ain't got time. - What's going on, Harlan? - What do you mean? - Why is my bag out? - 'Cause we're gonna get outta here. - What're you talking about? - Like I said, I told you I would figure this out. I did, look, look, it took me a little while, but I got some real dough together. This'll take us a long way and then we can get set up and send for Lonnie, or whatever you wanna do. Whatever you wanna do, we can do it now. I packed a few things, I mean, I didn't know exactly what you would want, but I just got excited. I got seven of everything. I couldn't find seven of your bras. I mean, I put your dress in, but I'm sure there's stuff you're gonna want. Little things I don't know about? Sweetheart, what do you say? Come on. - Okay, Harlan, my dad's gonna be here any second, so let's just go, right now, okay? - No, no, no, we got time, we got time. Just, let's get our stuff. 'Cause we ain't gonna have another chance. - Harlan, no, come on, put this back, please. - No, no, hey, whoa whoa, what're you doin'? - Harlan, you know if my dad sees this he's gonna kill me, okay, so let's just-- - He's not gonna kill ya. Sweetheart, sweetheart. We're gonna be a long way away before he figures this out. - Harlan, I told you the other day that I didn't wanna go away. - No. That wasn't you talkin', though. - Who was it, then? - That was someone else's voice talkin' through you. That was your fear-- - Okay, you know what? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about right now, okay, so I think you need to go. - October, listen to me. Sweetheart, I know you're scared, but we ain't gonna get another chance. Now you gotta look down inside you and listen to your true heart, listen to what it's telling-- - Okay, you know what, this is my true heart, and this is my true voice and I want you to go, okay? Go! - Don't holler at me! - There is a need to holler, you're not listening to me, and you need to get out of here! What is wrong with you, Harlan? - What's wrong with you? Sweet pea. Sweet pea, I didn't... Honey, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Just keep breathing. Keep breathing. - 911, state your emergency. 911, what is your emergency? Hello? - Anyone home here? Tobe? Lonnie? Tobe? Tobe? Somebody help my daughter! Somebody help my daughter! - Do you have any other firearms in the house? - I keep them all under lock and key. - Except for the one. - He must've broken into it. - The case wasn't broken into. - Well, look, he got it, somehow. - Okay. She say anything? - No. She was, she was already unconscious. - What about your son? - He came home after we left. - Does he have access to your guns? - No way. - His fingerprints were on the gun. Could've been an accident. - It wasn't an accident. - Well, nobody else has seen this cowboy person, Wade. - Hey, Twig. Hey, bud. - Tobe got shot. - Yeah, I know it. I got hit, too. - Who did it? - She didn't say nothin' to nobody? - She's in coma. - It was Wade. - It was? - Yeah. I came over here to see her, I wanted to say goodbye, 'cause I was goin' away for a while. She wanted to come with me and... We were talkin' about it and we didn't hear him come home. He come at me with that gun. Tobe got in between us, then he shot her. She was tryin' to protect me and he shot her. What kind of a son of a bitch would do a thing like that? He'd have shot me too, but I jumped out that window. - Where'd you get shot? Does it hurt? - No, it just went through the skin. I'll be all right. - They found my fingerprints on the gun. I have to talk to the police tomorrow morning. - Twig. I want you to listen to me. I think that you should go and get some of your things together and you should come with me right now. - I can't. - Yes, you can. Now, sooner or later, those cops are gonna figure out it was your dad that done this thing. And when they do, they're gonna lock him away. Then they're gonna take you, and they're gonna put you with another family. - No, they won't. - Yes, they will. Now, if you get lucky, maybe you'll get a good one. One that'll be nice to you, and keep you around for a long time. But I think the chances of that are slim. 'Cause people don't want a half-grown kid. They want a little baby they can raise up from scratch. They'll even take one from China, if they have to. That's the truth. You're gonna end up a ward of the state, bud. Do you know what that means? Mm, it's about the worst thing that can happen to a kid. And I don't want that to happen to you. If you wanna come with me, I'll take you outta here. Go up to my hideout for a while? When Tobe gets better, we'll come down here and we'll get her, too. And then all three of us will take off and leave this whole shitty place behind. What do you say, bud? You wanna go with me? - Yeah. - All right. Go and throw a few of your duds in a bag, and get me a blanket. And I'll meet you out in the back alley, okay? Come on. Come on, come on. Whoa. Hey, Twig! - Hi. - It's gonna be a beautiful day. You hungry? - Yeah. - Let's get somethin' to eat and go for a ride, all right? - Yeah. - Boy, that's about as high up as you can get around here. Are you cryin', bud? - I'm sorry. - Don't ever be sorry for cryin'. Ain't no shame in that. I try not to cry in front of someone, if I think they're against me, but that's about it. - Is Tobe gonna be okay? - Is that what you're worryin' about? You know what? Come here. Come on, come with me, I wanna do somethin' with ya. I think we should say a prayer. Send a message to Tobe and these antennas here will carry it down to her. She'll hear us communicatin' with her and she'll wake up. Okay? - Okay. - Let's close our eyes. Tobe. I love ya. And Twig here loves ya. And God and all the angels are pullin' for ya along with us. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. - Mr. Summers. She's up. - Hi. - Hi. What happened? - Well, you've been passed out. - I feel really weird. Where's Lonnie? - Lonnie? Lonnie! Lon! - Hey. - He isn't here. Lonnie? Lonnie! Remember me? - Oh, yeah. You're the dad who can't keep control of his own kid. Lets her hang around with a liar. - Well, that liar shot my daughter. And he ran off with my little boy. What we'd like to know is if you've seen him, since we met. - No, sir, but I had a horse stole. Same one. - Have you tried to look for the horse? - Of course I looked for him, I found him about a half-mile over that little green hill there. Started up into the draw and I lost him. - Can you show us where? - Do you ride? If you scatter your seeds to the wind and move on, you ain't never gonna get nothin' but weeds. You gotta plant 'em. Neat little rows. And then look after each one, like it's the only one. - You hear that? - See that raw right up there? - Right, I got it. - You ever eat a rabbit before? - No. - Hey, bud. Come on, let's take a walk, I wanna show you somethin'. - What? - Come on, just trust me. Come on. You hold onto that for a while. - Where are you goin'? - I'm right here. I ain't goin' anywhere. - You there? - Yeah, I'm right with ya. Now you're okay, just work your way back to that fire. - What was that? - That's just another scared creature like us. Don't run. Move, but don't move like fear moves. Move like a panther, move confident. Then you will be. - Hey, it's comin' from this way. I heard voices down over here. - Harlan? Harlan! - There he is! Grab the boy! - He's back there! - Come on! - No, no, no, don't shoot! Lonnie! Lon. - Well, they sure ain't gonna find us, 'cause I don't even know where we are. Come on. Hey. Hey. Whoa. - Where are we? - His name's Martin Lasson, he's a local kid from Rosita. Did a year in Chino for robbery. It says he was in some juvie hall over there in Ventura County. Is that where you work? - No. - Sure be a funny coincidence, though, if it was. - Yeah. - Would you take a turn with me? Well, I'm asking you. Should we run it? It's awfully nice. - Yes, it is. A town ain't a real town till it has a dance. - Would you take a turn with me? - I hardly feel I have the right to ask a lady such as yourself to dance. - Well, I'm asking you. - Felt better, yeah. - Yeah. - See you in a sec. - Hey, bud, I think that's yours. - Thanks, man. - Let's make room for our new marshal and his lady fair! - Duty calls, man. I'll catch you later. - Harlan! Harlan! - Lon? - Jesus! - Don't take another step! - Martin, take it easy! - You take it easy! Come on, Twig, come on down. Untie that horse. - Lonnie, get out of there. - Wade, you take another step toward that boy, and I'll put the next one in your head and I ain't foolin'. - Hey, hey, look, nobody's gonna shoot anybody, we're just gonna put our guns down, we're gonna talk about it. - No, you're gonna put your gun down. Do it right now! Do it, easy, easy! Thumb and a finger, real slow. You, too! Drop that belt! Go on, drop it! Go on, Lonnie, untie the horse. - Lonnie, he shot Tobe. - You shut your fuckin' mouth! - The girl is not dead, Martin. - You can tell the police all the lies you want to, Wade, but you and me both know it was you that killed her. - You're out of your fuckin' mind! - Lonnie knows it's true too! He seen the same thing that I seen! - Harlan! - Come on, Lonnie, come on! Come on! Let's go. Aw, hell. - Are you okay? - Yeah, take that. Press it against there. Press it right there. Come on, press it, press it. We gotta get off this ridge. - Harlan. - Hey. Hey, we gotta get outta here. Come on, get me on my feet. - What about Lightning? - Go on, go on! - You gonna be all right? - I hope so. I don't wanna die in a place like this. I don't like it in here. Hey, hey. Look out there. - It's Lightning. - What's he doin'? - He's just standin' there. - He's gonna give us away. You gotta get him outta there. Bring him around back and put him in the garage. No, hey, look at me. You can do this. Go on, go on. Go on, you can do it. - He was scared, but he's okay now. - Stop! - No, Lonnie, wait. - Harlan! - Lonnie. He shot your sister. Listen to me, he shot Tobe. Lonnie, he shot her. - You're lying. - I'm not. She'll tell you.
