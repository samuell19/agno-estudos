No. - Absolutely. That's right. - That's her. Would you like more champagne? Can I help you? You have one new message. My name is Jasmine. I've been contacting Mother's friends and past students and family. Mother was killed two days ago in a robbery. We're having a service at Rocky Point Beach... 8 a.m. on Sunday. I hope you'll be able to make it. Horse stance, going this way. Turn, shoulder position. That's it. It's good to see you, man. It's been a long time. - It's been a long time. - Yeah. - You look good. - So do you. Sorry about Mother. I know he meant a lot to you. - Yup, he meant a whole lot to all of us. - Yeah. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the things he taught me. This should be an interesting crowd. Well, it's what you would expect... from a super agent, cross-dressing martial-arts instructor. Amen, Father. Amen. Well, let's get started. Thanks for coming, everybody. Thanks for being here. Mother and I shared a lot of early morning walks along this beach. Today, we're placing Mother's remains where he'd want them to be. If there's anybody that would like to share a few words... in honor of his memory... now is the time to do it. Anybody? Thank you, thank you. Mother had a lot of secrets. I was one of them. Mother was my father. Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet my father's friends... but I know that all of you will miss his laughter... and his spirit and his fashion sense... as much as I will. Thank you. Thank you. Into thy hands, my Lord... we place the spirit, the body and soul... of Daniel Maurice Clements... affectionately known as "Mother" by his dear friends... For it to be a martial science, it needs principles. - What are those principles? - Principle objective. Principle surprise. Principle calculation. Principle offensive. Thank you. Mother, Mother, Mother. Well. Excuse me, Miss Clements. Actually, it's Cruz. Cruz. My name is Nigel Stone. I was a friend of your father's. You know, that's interesting. I thought your name was Neil Shaw. I'm sorry. Excuse me? My father told me about you. Here's my number. And if you need anything, anything at all... just give me a call. You know you are the reason why my father is dead? You really think my father died in some random robbery attempt? He died because somebody thought he was a security risk. Because he knew every face and every name. I'm not in that business anymore. Good day, Mr. Shaw. How did I ever let you talk me into coming to Afghanistan? Ann, not a good idea. Put the camera away, all right? Sir, this is a hot zone. Hi, hello, I'm Ann. I'm a journalist. Your commanding officer, Captain Mitchell... has given me permission to take photos. He's approved the stills. Look, I have an idea. How about next time, try and report on Las Vegas showgirls, huh? - You'd like that, wouldn't you? - Hell, yeah. Fancy hotels, little chocolates on the pillows. No land mines. That's his signature. I don't like it. Go, go, go. Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup. Oh, fuck. Come on, now. Go. Come on, get down. Somebody's behind you. Don't get up, stay still. Come on. Now. Let's go. Get down. Quick, come on. Let's go, let's go. Get in there. All right, we got two options. We can stay here and die... or we can get to that building. You with me? - Let's go. - What do you think? You don't like the way it's cut? What, man? - What did I do? - Ann is your VIP. You will stay very close to her side. If necessary, shield her from sight with your body. Okay, that's a wrap for talent. I mean, he wouldn't be a cowboy... and protect his primary at the same time. You always got my back, man. Oh, hey, I got a great idea for the next scene. Excuse me. - Stone. - It's Melina. I have something for you. Can you come to the dojo? Light horse stance. Going to your left, shoulder position, turn. Shoulder position, back fist. Center, turn. Watch your shoulder. Back fist. Center. Center, up. Knock, knock. I didn't think you would come. I'm really sorry about what I said. The other day, I was upset and... You said you had something you wanted to give to me? Yes, the picture. Just wait. I was packing up my father's things and I found this. And I thought you might like to have it. That was a long time ago. Rest in peace. Thank you. Do you mind if I look around a little more? Yes, please. Well, well, well. Rule number one, work hard. Rule number two, work harder. Remember these moves if you are challenged. A lot of pain in here. I always wished he was around when I was a kid. So where were you? My mother left the country when I was a baby. She didn't even tell me his name until she was on her deathbed. I tracked him down. That was three years ago. He was a great man. Great man. We became very close in those three years. Close enough to reveal secrets that should have remained secret. Are you talking about yourself? Is there more? He taught me to dance. He taught you the dance? He taught me the dance. Maybe you wouldn't mind giving me some demonstration. What, right now? I mean, if you're scared, I can understand. Okay. - Okay? - Okay. But I have to warn you, I'm a little bit rusty. Well, you don't look rusty to me. And I need a partner. Will I do? I guess you're leading, huh? Where I come from, men usually lead. Is that so? - Stone. - It's Garret. - Can you meet me at the boat? - I'll be there. - Give me 30. - All right, half-hour. Business. Will you call me? Yes. I'll call you. You need more practice. So you heard I was running for Senate? Yeah. I did, I saw that. When I was in the grocery store, waiting in line. Well, it's true. Seriously, bro. I am getting into politics. Why would you want to do that? It's in politics where you can make a difference, right? And that is exactly what I wanna do. I've just got one little problem. Now, that is what I believe they call blackmail. Okay. Who are they and why are they doing it? I don't know, maybe someone who doesn't wanna see me campaign. Look, take my advice. Stick to making movies. Come on, I'm just... I'm asking you to maybe just do a little snooping around. I'm not a detective. But you once told me you worked at one of those agencies, right? Can't you make a few phone calls? Come on, man. Okay. I'll look into it. - Thank you. - Look, Garret... keep it clean. You're in politics now. Got the order form right here. - Okay. - Thanks. Mr. Garret. There's a delivery here. - Hey, where would you like this here? - Hold on a second. - Just throw it in there, it's fine. - Oh, sure. Look, Michael, listen to me. You got them by the balls. Just give them a squeeze for chrissake. It's a hundred grand a day or I don't show up. Check on the girls. Okay, fine. Garret. Well, aren't you going after him? Don't have to. I hurt myself on that one. You? Okay. Alex. - I like your office. - Yeah, it's, you know... The crashing of the pins calms me down. - I see. - Yeah. - Hey, Geena. - Shaw. - What you got for me? - I got good stuff. Come on, come on. Just join us on the other side, please. Your FBI buddy, Becker, is involved in this. - Becker? - Yeah. - We knew you would... - Yeah. Well, that's not good. Dinner is served. Check it out. - The cell phone was FBI property. - I'm not surprised. Who's he protecting? You'll love this. Senator Carlson, and today is Thursday. Carlson, Thursday? Seems like she's on the same hit list as Garret. - You know who sent him? - No. It's gonna take a bit longer. There's some kind of crazy encryption on the other end. Where did you get it? Uninvited guest. An uninvited guest, huh? - Cool, an assassin. - Nope, not cool. - Well done. - Gutter ball. - Everything cool? - Yeah, he's back in. I told you. Did you know the Romans, if you hadn't paid your debts... would tie you to a stake and let the lions eat you? No, I can't say that I do, Sallas, but I'm sure there's some relevance. General, let me introduce you to the L900 Battle Rifle. This uses high-velocity, uranium-depleted bullets. They are perfectly effective on quarter-inch steel... half-inch steel... the crankcase of a diesel engine. Let's go have a look-see, general. Five years, $60 million. Everything on the line, and we finally have it figured out. Take a close look, general. His debt has been paid. Now, can you imagine what I do to people... who don't take my product seriously? The L900 Battle Rifle has my full support. I knew you would be impressed. Let me escort you to your car. Over there, a hundred yards to the right. So we're gonna stick around and see if we can get some footage. Oh, here we go. She's here. Getting a satellite image of the building. Seconds away. Senator Carlson. Senator Carlson, can you tell us how your senatorial race is proceeding? Shouldn't you be telling me? We got live video. Coming up on the screen. The polls put you way out in front. Can you tell us how you feel about it? I'm here to talk about our booming economy. And our need for more tax cuts. It's all about the vote, and that's always held in November. I'm concentrating on winning my Senate seat. They say you can't have tax cuts and a strong military, I say they're wrong. - And your business plan? - My five-point reduction plan... Save it for the speech, senator. This way. I have a lot more to say. Good afternoon, senator. - Do you know what you're missing? - No. A "Vote for Carlson" pin. - Thank you. - It's an honor to meet you, senator. We have audio. So good to meet you. We have a situation. Suitcase unattended, over. Hold it. - Ma'am, we have a security threat. - What kind? It's an unattended bag, possible Code 996. - We should head back to the limo. - Okay. Senator, we need to talk. - How did you get in here? - It's okay, Michelle. He's a friend. - I don't think you should do this. - See to it we have privacy. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. That's right, carry on. Senator Carlson. We have reasons to believe... that there's gonna be an attempt on your life. Based on what information? A message was taken off the assassin's cell phone... targeting you. We believe it's credible. Blackmail attempts, smear campaigns, the usual crap. And now you're telling me someone wants to kill me? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Do you have any idea as to who? No, but I have an idea who would know. Congressman Grant Phillips. I voted against his last six arms bills. I'm sure he would know, or someone close to him. Phillips. - Phillips, Armed Services Committee. - Chairman of. If I was seen to go after Phillips directly... I could kiss my Senate re-election goodbye. Congressman Phillips is having a party tonight. For friends and wealthy supporters. If you're as good as I hear, you'll manage to poke around his office... while everyone is sipping champagne and kissing ass. So you know who I am? Why else do you think I'm sitting here talking to you? - Are you going to be there? - Of course. I keep my friends close but my enemies closer. Sun Tzu, The Art of War. His teachings also apply to the art of politics. True that is. Ma'am, the bomb threat's over. We have to begin. Cancel the speech. What? Just do it. Well, now I see why they have a problem with you. Smart lady. - Becker. - It's Graham. - I gotta talk to you. - Excuse me. - Neil Shaw's alive. - Shaw? Last I heard, he was a corpse on the streets of New York. He's been talking to Senator Carlson. Senator Carlson? What the hell is he doing talking to her? I don't know, but she didn't make her speech. This conversation never took place. - Stone. - Hey, it's Garret. How is it coming? Tell me what you know about Carlson and Phillips. Well, I can vouch for Carlson. She's got a clean reputation. Congressman Phillips, I know him personally. He doesn't seem the type. What do you mean, the type? That would blackmail and try to assassinate a colleague? No, Phillips and I have a business arrangement. I'd actually support his policies. Why would he come after me? That's what I'm hoping to find out at the congressman's house tonight. Look, once I start digging, things could get messy. Oh, believe me, I love messy. Keeps things interesting. Look, I'll see you at the party, right? Well, hopefully not. - That is good. - Good evening. There's someone I'd like you to meet. Thank you. - Samantha. - Grant. - It's a wonderful party, as usual. - Have you met our local celebrity? - Hi, I'm John Garret. - It's a pleasure. Pleasure's all mine. - Sorry, I'll be back in a moment. - Well... I understand you're the new fair-haired boy... that's being groomed to step out of Phillips' shadow at the convention. Well, I think Congressman Phillips knows what this country needs, right? - I didn't think you were coming. - Well, it's a great party. I heard you were a little uncomfortable with our latest consultation fees... so I figured I'd talk to you face to face. - No, it wasn't about the fee. - Then it's about your support? Mark, I don't support the bill. I'm not discussing it again. Enjoy the party. Here you go. I'll be right back. Senator Carlson. - We haven't officially met. - Mr. Sallas. I've heard a lot about Lycar Industries. Most people have. Our stock prices doubled over the past year... and we're looking at a 25-percent increase over the next three months. That's very impressive. Can I help you? I understand you have a very successful export business. Well, exports are one thing... but we have been actively trying to go after the domestic military market. - Yo. - I'm in. Alex, no footprints on this. Me and my posse have never been caught. - Done. - We're in. I am scanning as we go. Anything? I'm looking. Okay, here we go. We got a backup file. Everything, multiple offshore accounts... from a Mark Sallas... and all of Phillips' transaction histories. All right, encrypt it and forward it to Carlson. Okay. Every bid is open for tender. Open, yes, but, you see, not to newcomers. As you know, I alone don't have any input into military procurement. No, but if you were to vote in favor of the bill... - Sorry, excuse me. - Yeah, but... I got you, Phillips. Congressman, are you all right? The senator has been shot. Are you okay? - Peter. - Wait, what happened? Check inside. - I got it, I got it. - We got two men down. Is he all right? Senator. Clear. - Yes, sir. - I don't know... - Senator. - Check the backstairs. Phillips is dead. Please explain to me how this operation... suddenly became a complete shit storm. We underestimated Shaw's expertise. So now he's alive and Senator Carlson can't shut up. Wonderful work. We can attach Carlson to Phillips' murder. Not until we know what intel Carlson can counter with. For now, Sallas wants Shaw eliminated. I'll authorize any support the bureau can muster. - Isn't that a little risky? - I'm senior officer. No one will question it. Search every contact... every ho he's banged, every number he's dialed. Station agents at all his known locations. If Shaw so much as glances at a surveillance camera... or swipes a credit card or calls someone he knows... He's dead. You should remind me, Joe. We need more buns, we're running low. I thought you didn't do this shit anymore. So did I. Let me tell you a story. Look, I don't have the time. Is it one of those long ones? No, I'll give you the short version. But I was in the same situation one time. It was on my last operation. I was in Cambodia. I was fighting with some mercenaries... when one of the rebel factions decided... that ethnic cleansing would be in order. - They hit the village I was staying at. - What did you do? I did the same thing you would have done. I used every trick I'd ever been taught... and I fought for those villagers. I took out 12 killers that day and I ended up becoming the target. But those people, they kept me hidden for weeks. They gave me food, they gave me shelter. They gave me love. And I survived because of them... and the grace of God. And so will you. - Hello. - Neil. - Cruz. - Look, I know this is crazy... but I think someone is watching me. There's a man in a car outside. - Where are you? - I'm at the acad... He's coming toward the dojo. Hello? Hello? I need some wheels. You got it. Look, you know you don't have to do this. You know I do. And anything else you need, you let me know. We have to call the police. Let's go. I killed that man. I killed him. You saved my life. I don't understand. Who was he? I don't think he was after you. I think they were after me. Why? It's a long story. Now, just don't worry about it, okay? You're gonna be okay. All right? Melina? It's okay. How can you keep saying that? It's not okay. I'm going to be wanted for murder. Look, you were in a life-and-death situation... and you reacted. You did what you had to do. I think it'd be safer if you flew back home. I'll see what I can find on the first flight out and take you to the airport. Could you please stop the car? I think I'm going to be sick. Yeah. - Stone. - Oh, yeah, your alias. Hey, wow. I thought I was having a crazy night. Half the world is looking for you. You can't believe everything you read. Well, what the hell is going on? Somebody tried to set me up for a big fall. Listen, what are the chances this signal is being traced? You haven't ditched your phone yet? Not yet. Well, you're lucky I'm secure, man, because you're holding a hot potato. Look, I'll call you in a couple hours. Okay. Yeah, give me some of those too, man. Damn. You got any spots? Man. - Hey, yo. - What up? - You got any spots? - You're kidding me, right? - I'm a little light. - Yeah, I'll call you back. Yo, 60 bucks for the ticket. Forty dollars for the restaurant. What? - You want my bank account? - Why do you gotta be all that? I tell you, I'm a little light right now. I'm a little light right now. - I got it next time, man. - You know you're broke, Ray. Whatever, brokeback, I'll get you next time. You ever give me the money you owe, and I'll change that thing for a Bentley. Yo, got my phone? I ain't got your phone. - Don't play, man. Where's my phone? - How I got...? Yo, check my man over there. Hey, old man, got my phone? - No, man. - Freaking immigrant. He's playing you, man. He's the only one out here. Hey, asshole, did you take my phone? - Hey. - Got my phone, man? Hey, yo, man. Let's go. Let's go. I'm not going. What? I'm not going. I'm not leaving, I'm not running away. I'm my father's daughter. I can take care of myself. Look, I don't know what the hell is going on here... but clearly, I'm the target. And by association, that makes you a target too. Okay. Okay. Let's find a hotel. Okay. Okay, we got him again. Looks like he's heading north. We have a team already in the vicinity to intercept. Get me Becker. Out of the car. Out of the car now. What's going on, man? Come on, man. Man. - Yo, man, where's my lawyer? - Cool it, cool it. Where is he? What's he driving? He switched cell phone cards with gangbangers. He's traveling in some old van from the Salvation Kitchen. He may or may not be alone. Get the locals on it. Do you think that Senator Carlson set you up? Maybe, but I need proof. - Can you get me her phone records? - Yeah, no problem. And Mr. Shaw needs a new identity, okay, Geena? - Hook him up with the works. - Works, ID, credit cards? Yes. You and the senator are pretty chummy. What? It says here that you've called her over 150 times... in the last year and a half. I never called Senator Carlson. This says that you did, and this stands up in court. Hey. Stone's bank account and credit cards have all been flagged. What did you do? Oh, piss somebody off. Okay, somebody's trying to kill two birds with one stone. Okay, I see. This makes it look like Carlson hired me to kill Phillips. That would cancel both of them out. Is Carlson under investigation? Not yet. - But she will be? - Yup. Who stands to benefit from the latest round... of military-spending votes? Same old. Hali B, GD. Lycar Industries is supposed to have the biggest experimental division. There's a report on them, like, every week. - She's good. - She is good. Blogosphere says Lycar's getting funding... for top-secret sci-fi stuff. Yeah, but Lycar makes most of its profits from R&D... licensing technology to third parties. They're not a big defense supplier. But Lycar Industries' president is Mark Sallas. I might have something. Alex Hahn. If he's teamed up with Hahn... Hahn's a messiah in the world of geekdom. He founded the Eco Alliance, a team of killer hacktivists. There's no system that can lock him out. How the hell do we get a hold of him? Alex just knows and shows up. If he pays taxes, uses electricity or has a passport... his location must be in our computer system. Don't you think? - Find him. - Yes, sir. Any report about the shooting? What happened at the academy would be professionally cleaned. No body, no fingerprints. No traces. Can I ask you a personal question? Sure, go ahead. When you were an agent, did you kill people? Yes, a few. Is that why you grew apart from my father? Mother was a big fan of the philosopher Sun Tzu. The supreme art of war is the ability... to subdue your opponent without fighting. That didn't go very well with my day job. And...? My insides got all messed up. So out of respect, I kept my distance. He always thought you were a good person, Neil. Maybe I was. Come on. Come on. - Stone. - Shaw. Hey. Okay, I got something. I hacked back into that cell phone you gave me. I'll be there. Becker. We may have a lead to Shaw's location. Let's go. I'm fucking brilliant. Who are you? This is the friend I was talking about. This is Melina. Look, it's necessary. Okay? I'll tell you about it later. Stan. It's okay, go with them. I know, I know. It's cool. Come on. What you got? What do you got? Okay, so it's possible to hack in and change the phone log. That's child's play. But if someone were to look... it wouldn't match with the antenna synchronized code output. All right. English. Every cell call has a personal imprint... from the corresponding antenna, so if it's on your phone bill, it's tagged. So if someone really wanted to cover their tracks... they would hack into the antenna database and insert the right codes. And that's what they did. But every hacker leaves a trail. And that trail leads to a building here in L.A. Homeland Security. Yeah. Can you get in? We need a blueprint of the building. Yes. It's like a mini Fort Knox on security steroids. Guards, guns and cameras 24 I7. Motion detectors inside and on the roof. Windows? Lexan and alarmed. Break one and: Any suggestions? Go in as a repairman, you can ignite the chlorofluorocarbons... in the air-conditioner system, which is mostly chlorine. That way, you create a crude form of mustard gas. No, no, seriously, flood the vents and watch them hurl. That's seriously cool. That's morbid is what it is. Only if you electronically lock the doors... so that they suffocate and die a hideously painful death. Actually, Geena, the air conditioning has just been upgraded. Damn it. What about if we bypass this just right over there? Okay, look, I think I have an idea. It's simple... and nobody gets gassed. But I think it'll work. Are you sure this is gonna work? Yeah, I am. Encryption codes are codes that send out seemingly random data packets. Actually, they're in a predetermined sequence. I can program the surveillance satellite to identify patterns... similar to one Alex sold the government. If I eliminate government users, Alex will surface and we got him. How long? - Five minutes. - You got two. What the hell? - Disgusting. - It's just rats, for God's sakes. Just rats? Is that all? We got a couple of them in the corners. Security? Yeah, this is Ben, communication offices. We need pest control up here. Thank you very much. System tracking. Get a lock on the address. Shaw's with this little creep, I know he is. - Okay, I'm in. - Okay, it'll be your first right. Locking in. Loft building, upper floor. Bingo, we got him. He's got surveillance cameras inside and out. Tapping into them. We're in. Switching between cameras. Wow, Alex Hahn himself. On your screen. Where's Shaw? No, turn around, turn around. Wrong way, turn around. All right, up the stairs. Up the stairs, good. Double doors at the top of the stairs. I see them. Just a few moments. Almost there. Team's in the quadrant, five miles away. Audio reception complete and online. I know you're busy, but when you get a chance... could you give me everything you got on Neil Shaw? Oh, shit. Hey, two fingers. Let's go. Now, the rest of you, two fingers. Come on, you know the routine. Now, I want everything you got on Senator Carlson... John Garret and Shaw downloaded to that disk. Don't show him anything. That's an order. Well, maybe this will override that order. Know what this is? You know what this is. Sarin. Sarin, sarin, sarin. See, I'm already dead, so I don't give a shit. Unless you wanna join, you better give me the information I ask for. So, what do you think? Good girl. Good. - Mitchell, Daniels, with me. Let's go. - Move it, move it. Two round back, two front. - You guys take the stairs. - Got it. Somebody on the elevator. - Sanders. - Who's on point? We got six agents coming at us, totally armed. Sanitize, sanitize. Sanitize. What is that? - Clear those out. - Got it. Get that in the shredder. You ordered a tactical hit on Alex Hahn? - We got two. Take them all. - No... - Call it off. Call it off. - I can't. Call it off. Alex, get out of there. - In there. Move. - Go, go, go. Anything? Take her down. - We're all clear. - Clear. Graham, do you copy? Graham, do you copy? Graham, are you there? I'm sorry, he's not in right now. Can I take a message? Shaw. Becker. You just made it to the top of my hit list. Let's go. Come on. Come on, get it, get it, get it. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Okay. Eye drops. I'm sorry about your friend. He knew the risks. It's too dangerous to go back to the hotel tonight. I'll get you some clean sheets, a couple of pillows... and you guys can stay as long as you need. You get any sleep last night? About an hour. She's still sleeping. You know you can talk to me anytime if you want. Becker tracked Alex Hahn last night. Full tactical assault. No survivors. You weren't there, man. There's nothing you could have done to stop it. I promised him I'd watch his back. I let him down. I think they're gonna go after Senator Carlson. Has Carlson got anything on these senators taking bribes? I gave her a file I found on Phillips' computer. Maybe she will use it. According to the morning news, if she's going to take down... her colleagues, it's probably gonna be tonight. Why is that? There's a big party debate, Roosevelt Hotel. Carlson is gonna be center stage. - That will be a good place to kill her. - Yeah. Unless you get her out of harm's way. And I'm coming with you. I thought you didn't do this shit anymore. I thought you said you were a man of God. I have always been a man of God. Official business with the senator. Thank you. Excuse me, senator... but something very important has just come up. Shaw is waiting outside. I'm okay. - What is going on? - He'll tell you. Stay close. - I'm fine. - Let's go. If she's not back in five minutes, go after her, okay? - Graham. - The senator just left. I'll get the intel to Becker. I'm following the soup van. I'm sure Shaw's with them. Get a satellite lock on your position. I'll call in the troops. They're heading for the river. - You got that? - Yes, sir. You look good as a blond. There you go, blondie. All right, let's go. Melina. Look... - Look, I want you stay in here. - No, no, no. - Here, take this. - Neil, Neil. Somebody comes in, you shoot him. - Shaw... - Stay here. Stay in here. It's too big. We can't hit this without proper recon. There's no time. We'll split in pairs, maintain radio contact. Shoot the senator on sight. Sallas. You were right. Shaw set us up with a decoy. Carlson never left the restaurant. What's your situation? It's salvageable. Well, then, kill Shaw and whomever is helping him. Copy that. I've got Carlson covered. Where's the driver? There's no cell-phone reception down here. I'll go back upstairs, it'll take me a moment. I'll see where he's at. Thank you. Make it quick. Senator Carlson. I heard you were planning a little speech tonight... on corporate bribery. Very good. It's over, Mark. I have Phillips' account numbers, dates, deposits. Lycar Industries is finished. Reaching the lower level. Why do you have to be so goddamn righteous? All you had to do was take the money... and back the bill like everybody else who vote in my favor. No big deal. Reaching the sixth level. You've left me with no other choice. You threatened my reputation... my supporters, my business. I learned a very valuable lesson, Samantha. The trick to killing off your enemies is simplicity. Like a heart attack. You know. Or a brain aneurysm. Please. Almost done. Losing your touch there, Becker. Where did it all go wrong, huh? Hiding behind a girl, tacky suit. Yeah, just like old times, eh, Stone? Nice name. You've been a pawn too long, Shaw. I got you. I'm fine. It's suppertime. I got 63 hot meals I gotta deliver. Please, let me up. Please. Stay here with my friend. What? Neil, wait. Where are you going? Let me come with you. Neil. Stay here with him. He could use your beauty. Get this checked out as well. Neil, I'm afraid. It's okay. Everything is gonna be fine. - I have a meeting with Mark Sallas. - Your name, please? Tell him it's Neil Shaw. I don't see you scheduled. What is this regarding? It's okay, I got it. Sir? Excuse me, sir. Yes, Julie? Mr. Sallas, I have a Neil Shaw coming up to see you. I couldn't stop him. No, that's okay. - I'll handle it. - Yes, sir. You have a miraculous ability at keeping yourself alive, Mr. Shaw. So did you kill Phillips yourself? Or did you just order the hit? I always deal with my business face to face. Phillips was an exception. Senator Carlson, on the other hand... What happened to her? Oh, didn't you hear? She died of a brain aneurysm. Stress-related, I think. Hot damn. What the hell was that? So that's what this is all about. Sell more guns to the Army, earn more money, huh? You really don't get it, do you? It's not about the money. Bullshit. We need people in office... who care about defending this country. Well, how high up the ladder does it go? The president? I play golf with him. But he knows nothing about how we manage business. That game is over. You're a dead man, Shaw. Yeah? What's new? - Did I hit you? - Not yet. Great gun, though. Did I hit you? You've been a very bad boy, Sallas. You hurt a lot of good people. People I love. My friends. My family. That doesn't matter now. There's nothing you can do about it. You're going to jail. Shaw. Shaw. Oh, shit. I heard something. I'm not sure... You've been a pawn too long, Shaw. Damn. No, Phillips and I have a business arrangement. Why would he come after me? Okay, everything looks... It looks good. Understated, yet elegant. Guys, come on. You can't... Come on, let's clean these up, please. Okay, let's make sure that most of the higher campaign contributors... are sitting up front, close to the podium, right? Hey, do you think I look maybe a little too pasty? I don't know. Man, if my grandfather could be here now... Get Marsden up here. You guys take five minutes. I'll be right back. Mr. Stone. I'm sorry. Or should I say, Neil Shaw. I must say I'm pretty surprised to see you. Yeah, I bet you are. Are you busy? Yeah, I'm just getting started. You've been using me as a pawn from the beginning, John. Come on, it's politics. I wanted in the Senate. Sallas wanted to take out Phillips and Carlson. You know, I'm just the new guy with a friendly face. That's how you treat your friends? I just chalk them up to collateral damage. All is fair in love and politics, right? So that's what Mother was? Mother was collateral damage? Well, you killed him, didn't you? Or did you just pay for it? I'd like you to meet Susan Marsden. She's my protection... and the only good thing Sallas ever did for me. You could've used her back in your spy days. She's probably the best undercover operative I know. You played me deep. Nothing personal. Just business. Oh, come on. No hard feelings. She profiled you. Found out what your favorite little cafe in Italy was, what your favorite food is. Even which side of the bed you sleep on. So why kill Mother? Well... He was the only one that really meant anything to you. So you would clean house, Shaw. Come on, look. You helped me take out Sallas... and all those senators in his deep pockets. You know, I helped you blow the lid off this whole thing. The vote rigging, the slush funds, the illegal arms deals. Neil, I'm afraid. Everything is gonna be fine. I'm going to be wanted for murder. You did what you had to do. Yeah, you did. It's all gonna break in the papers tomorrow. Now, I'm gonna be voted in because I'm Mr. Hollywood. Coming up the hills, guns blazing. And I owe that all to you. Come on. Be part of it. Look, man, we can work out a deal, right? What are you gonna do now, huh? What are you gonna do? What's going on? He's got a gun. No, just stay back. I'm gonna call security. Shaw. Shaw. Shaw, I'm talking to you! What are you looking at? Get back to work. In a twisted plot of corruption and blackmail... several senators have resigned. At the center of it all is the late Lycar president, Mark Sallas... reportedly responsible for multimillion-dollar bribes... that were influencing the Senate itself. Sallas is currently the new suspect in the murders... of Senator Samantha Carlson and Congressman Grant Phillips. The other sensational headline of the day... is that Hollywood superstar and Senate hopeful, John Garret... has been arrested as a suspect in the murder of Susan Marsden.
