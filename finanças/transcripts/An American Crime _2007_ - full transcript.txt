I used to love the carnival. Daddy worked all the fairs, selling pretzels, candy apples. Always lookin' for something better. Sometimes Mama would follow, and sometimes he'd even take us. It was always a new adventure, with a whole new family every time. I figured Jennie and me were the luckiest girls in the world with a life like that. My favorite was the merry-go-round. Maybe I was a little old for it, but all those other rides, they scared me. But the merry-go-round just goes round and round and up and down. You don't get anywhere, but you always feel safe. That's me on the left. Sylvia. And this is my story. Would you please state your name. Lester Likens. Are you married to Betty Likens? Yes. Did you and your wife ever separate? Yes. What period of time did that occur? The last week in June, 1965. She was at Euclid Street and I was in Lebanon, Indiana. Where were the children? Jennie Faye and Sylvia Marie was with her. So, you think we'll make some friends? Sure we will. Maybe there'll be some cute boys this time. Church boys can be cute. Come on, girls. Don't wanna be late for our first service. Hey! Daddy. Hey, Jennie. What are you doin' here? I missed you girls. Betty, can I talk to you for a minute? You know, I've been talking to Horst, and he says that we could maybe swing our own booth at the State Fair this year. Maybe make enough money to go on tour. I told you, Lester, I can't do it anymore. Not with the girls. Maybe my mother'll take 'em. I can't move them up there again. They haven't even had a chance to make friends down here yet. Betty, maybe we wouldn't fight as much without the kids. Mama? You two go on ahead and catch the church bus home. I gotta settle things with your father. "See what love the Father has given us that we are called the children of God." And so we are. But how does the child come unto his father? How does the father come unto the child? Christ said, "I am the Way, the Truth, the Life, and none come unto the Father but by Me." Be good. Our fathers, our mothers. It is only through Christ that we find the Father. And it is only through Christ that we find each other. That's a beautiful dress, Hope. Oh, thank you, Gertrude. I'm, uh, I'm feeling much better on my new medicine, and if you know of anybody who needs ironing to be done, I'd appreciate the work. I'll do that. Thank you. What happened to your leg? That's not polite, Shirley. It's all right. She's used to it. So what is it? From polio. Polio? Does it hurt? Our Mama's sick, too. All right, girls. We gotta go. Can't they come with us? Want to come? We got some friends coming over, and you could meet our older sisters. Sure. Guess who got stuck with an extra shift at work? You get paid? Mm-hm. Got a little somethin' extra for dinner. Here, take the baby. Where'd they come from? What's this? We invited 'em to stay and play. We'll be quiet. All right, make sure of it. I like this song. What's your Dad do? He's a cop. And they're divorced. You miss him any? Nah. I just miss his money. It's true. Maybe if his support was more regular, Mama wouldn't be so sick and I wouldn't have to work so hard. Little Kenny's got a different daddy. Who's little Kenny? The baby. But we ain't supposed to talk about that. Ow. There. You should do this for a living. Yeah, if she was old enough. You want me to do yours? Oh, no, thanks. Yeah, she's the pretty one. Yeah, she's got nice hair. I'm pretty, too. The hell you are! I tell you what. Let's go get a Coke. My boyfriend works over at the liquor store. He could sneak us out a couple. Sure. You girls behave! We're going to the grocery. Tell Andy he owes me for little Kenny. Don't be wasting time on that bag boy. He ain't a bag boy, Mama! He's still a waste of space. She don't like my boyfriend. Yeah, I can see that. Hey, Johnny. Quit it! Sorry, Mrs. Doyle. Hey. You weren't at church today. Coy and I are heading there now. Yeah, you better be. Let's get out of here. My sister Stephanie. She's a big help around the house when she ain't wastin' time with her boyfriend Coy. Oh, God. Hey, Paula. Mama was askin' after her money. I'll bet she was. Who's your friend? Sylvia. But she don't talk to trash. 'Scuse me. That's my Mama's ex-boyfriend. He's only six years older than me. Just like her mama. That's him. That's my Bradley. He's real cute. We gotta be real careful, though. Why? Because he's married. I'm not even shittin' you! No! Paula! Don't tell me you never had a boyfriend. Ah, well. There was this guy in California, but... I guess it was nothin'. At least you did more than kiss, right? Well, aren't you just so damn pure! Come on. Let's go. This is Pleiku, 250 miles north of Saigon. The air base that was ripped by the incoming communist guerrillas. Marie! I need you to feed little Kenny. If I don't get this ironing to Mrs. Duke by four, I'm not gonna get a tip. We're out of milk. Go get some. They won't give us no more credit at the store. They will if you take the baby. Hello! Oh, hi. I'm sorry. Um, somebody said they saw my girls here. You got no family here in Indy? Well, not that I could leave 'em with. 'Cause of them or you? Well, little of both. Hi, Ms Baniszewski. Shirley and Marie here? Upstairs. Shut the door. Looks like you got kids running in and out of here all day long. Why don't you leave Sylvia and Jennie here with me? Oh, I couldn't do that. I got six kids. Two more won't make a difference. I guess that's true. $20 a week, and you won't have to worry. You'd be helping me out, too. Well, I could talk to my wife about it. It's... something to consider. So, you'd never met Gertrude Baniszewski before that day? No, sir. But you were willing to leave your children with a complete stranger? Well, like I said, uh, we got to talking, and she openly admitted that she would take care of the children and treat them like they were her own. Okay, here's 20 now, and, uh, you'll have the next payment a week Thursday. I'll need that money. Well, you'll have it. Johnny, bring the box upstairs. I appreciate that, sweetheart. I don't want you to go. The circuit'll be dying down at the end of September. That's over two months. And I promise I will be back to get you girls then. Okay, kids. Bye, Jennie. Cookie. You be good. Okay. All right. Bye, girls. You girls make sure you get everything you need. Thank you. Well, come on! We'll help you unpack. It's nothing to be nervous about. Everyone's real nice here, I promise. Hey, Paula, did ya get your cherry popped this summer? Well, you sure didn't, Teddy, not with a face like that. Come on, you know we're just playin'. Why don't you play with yourself? Coy's okay, but Teddy is a goddamn delinquent. Those guys, they're always messing with somebody. I'm sure she'll be okay. You living with Paula and them? Yeah. For a bit, I guess. Well... saw you the other day. I live right around the corner. I'm Ricky Hobbs. Sylvia. Hey, there's a football game this weekend if you'd be interested in that at all. I don't really much like football. Sylvia, come on! Goodbye! Me. I hope you brought my money. Nice to see you, too. Came by to see my babies. Hi. Hey. Leave him. I got my call-up papers. I'll be goin' to boot camp soon. Put him back down. Took me all day to quiet him. Not in front of the baby. Why? He don't care. I do! Listen, I'm gonna be gettin' a paycheck, so you'll be getting payments regular. Who's gonna take care of you? Well, actually, I was wondering if I could borrow a few dollars so I could go see my brother in Lebanon before I leave. If I had the money, I'd give it to you. I saw your new boarders. Don't tell me you're doing that for charity. I had to take them in because of you. I ain't paying for another man's kids. You ain't paying for your... I'm sorry, Gertie. I'm sorry. Sorry. So how was the first day of school? Well, I actually made a couple friends. See? We ain't such bad people here on the Southside. Can you pick up the kids and bring them home? There's something I gotta take care of. Is everything all right? Tell Mama I picked up an extra shift at work. Sure. You know, Paula's lookin' more and more like you every day. Lucky her. You should watch her, though. She's been hanging out with Bradley again. I hate to think what'll happen. Wife's got a bad temper. You think I could get that money? There's a 20 in the top drawer. Where do you live, Mrs. Doyle? 3848 East New York. You can almost reach out of your dining room window into the Baniszewski kitchen, can't you? It's not that close. Because of the experience that you saw Mrs. Baniszewski having there, did you develop any bias or a prejudice against her? No, I felt sorry for the lady. I felt she was a hard-working woman, with all them kids. Do you entertain any ill feelings or animosity toward her? No, I can't judge her. I beg your pardon? I can't judge her. Would you like to say grace, Sylvia? Sure. Bless this food to our use and us to Thy service. Amen. Amen. Somebody get out there and feed that dog. Sure, Mama. Sorry I'm late. Where've you been? I picked up a shift from Ellen. I told you I didn't want you to see that boy any more, and I mean it. I didn't see him. Don't lie to me, Paula. What, was he here? Did Andy say something? That is none of your business. You just don't want me making the same mistakes that you made. I said, feed that dog! Johnny, feed the dog! What's wrong, Paula? I've got problems, Sylvia. Big problems. With Bradley? I went to the doctor's office. I'm pregnant. You know he's already married. He ain't gonna want a baby. And I... I don't know what I'm gonna do. You gotta tell him. I can't. Well, you kinda gotta. You need to promise me that you won't say anything to anybody. Not a word until I figure out what I'm gonna do, okay? Yeah, I promise. It's gonna be okay. Oh. Mama? Mama! I want you all upstairs. Come on. Except for you two. I want you down in the basement. Your daddy's check didn't arrive today. Oh, it's probably just late. I mean, my mama, she wouldn't let him forget. You know what I think? I just took care of you two for two weeks for nothin'! I think your Mama and Daddy left you here for good. They wouldn't do that. Keep your mouth shut. Lean over those. Go on. Lean over. Come on. Come on. Don't, please. Get up! Gertie! No! Let go of me! Look, I can take hers. Okay. Come on. Okay. I need that money. Come on, Jennie. It ain't like we never had a spanking before. That check's gonna come tomorrow. I swear. Johnny! What? Give me that thing back. Stop it! Stop hurting me. I'm 15. I should be able to go. Someone's gotta look after the little ones. I wonder if Bradley is gonna be there. Stop it! Freedom was in jeopardy and a struggling people had been brought almost to their knees by aggression, when William Westmoreland was called to urgent duty. His mission was to deny aggression its conquest. It was a mission simple enough to state, but to execute that mission he had to fight the most complex war in all American history. So what are you gonna see tonight, Stephanie? We ain't gonna be seein' a movie, Marie. The only thing she'll be seeing is Coy's hands while she's pushing him away. I might not be pushing too hard. Yeah, yeah, Princess Priss. You'd scream if he breathed on your blouse. That's not true, Paula, and you know it. Don't give Sylvia the wrong idea now. Look, I shot his eye out. Why'd you do that? Johnny, get out of here! You're dead. This is crazy. This is argh! This is crap! There's nothing ever to do in this shithole town! It ain't that bad, Teddy! Yeah, it is. Hi. I don't know about you, but I'm staying out all night tonight. Your parents ain't gonna like that. They don't give a shit. Ticklish? You like it here? Yeah, it's real nice. Look who's here. I'll be right back. Maybe you shouldn't. Hey. Ricky, you shouldn't sneak up on girls like that. Sorry. Hey, nursery's around the corner. You might want to get back before they miss you. I brought some favors. Gimme some of that! What are you doing here? I just came to see you. I thought we talked about it. I'll just be right back. I already told you my wife's back from her cousin's house. That's it, okay? Now, be a good girl and go play with your friends. You know, my mama's been calling you trash, and I'm starting to believe her. You should listen to your mama, Paula. She knows best. I know you don't mean that. Get off me! Get off me! No, I don't... Is this what you want, huh? Something like this, huh? Stop it! Get the hell out. This is a private conversation. She's pregnant! Don't try to pull that shit on me. I know that ain't true. There ain't no way. Stay away. Paula, I'm so sorry. I just wanted... You're gonna pay for that. Paula! I ju... Is everything okay? Will you quit following me? Paula? Honey, you're crying. What's wrong? I ain't talking to him any more. Oh. That's a good girl. That's a good girl. Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna find you a good man, honey. Not like Andy or your daddy. But Sylvia said... What? She's tellin' horrible lies about me. What kind of lies? Telling everyone I'm a slut. You should've seen her with those boys, telling everyone I was a slut. Sylvia said that? Don't worry, babe. Don't you worry. Did you ever hear Sylvia use any profanity or vulgar language? No, sir. Now, do you know how often Sylvia went to Sunday School and church? She would go every time we would. Did Sylvia have a Bible? Yes. Did she dress up nice and clean? Yes, sir. As Matthew said, "Enter by the narrow gate, "for the gate is wide and the way is easy "that leads to destruction. "And those who enter by it are many, "for the gate is narrow and the way is hard "that leads to life. And those who find it are few." Jennie, come sit with me. We need to get upstairs and get changed. I want you all down here. Family meeting. It's a lesson for all of you. You need to apologize to Paula. But, Gertie, I didn't... I want you to apologize. What'd she do, Mama? She's been spreadin' lies about your sister. I'm sorry. Paula, you have a right to get even. What do you want to do? I want you to punish her, Mama. You need to learn to fight your own battles, baby. Johnny, grab her arms. I said I was sorry! I don't care what you said! Go on. She's got it comin'. That's it! See if she can defend herself. I am not! I am not! She's not! Dammit! That's it, that's it. Get up. Get up. She's learned her lesson. That's what happens when you tell lies. Go on. You, too. Get. Are you awake? Are you okay? Did you say your prayers yet? How about Mama's favorite Psalm? "Turn Thou to me, and be gracious to me, Lord, "for I am lonely and afflicted. "Relieve the troubles of my heart, "and bring me out of my distresses. "Consider how many are my foes. Thank you. "And with what violence they hate me. "Guard my life and deliver me. "Let me not be put to shame, "for I take refuge in Thee. "May integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for Thee." I hear your sister's pregnant. Who's the guy? Stop it, Coy. That's not funny. I didn't say it. A lot of people are talking. Why aren't you in school? You, uh, doing okay? Yeah. It's, uh, Sylvia, right? Yeah. Eric. Yeah, I... I've seen you at church. Yeah, that's me. You going to the picnic on Saturday? Um, I hope so. Okay. Maybe I'll see you there. I... I better go. Okay. What was Mama so upset about the other day? You heard. Told everyone Paula was a slut. That's not true, is it? There's some worse rumors going round about her now. You think she's pregnant? What do you think? She's easy. Thanks. How's your mama? Okay. She still in the hospital? Yeah. Who's taking care of you? I am. You don't have a girlfriend? I don't know. You don't know? No. I don't know. Does she know? You want a sip? I ain't old enough. You ain't old enough to smoke either, but that's not stoppin' you. Jennie? I think we should call Mom and Dad. How are we supposed to do that? I found this in the trash. So, uh, how long is Sylvia gonna be staying here? You got a crush on Sylvia? She is pretty. When I was in high school, I was popular with the boys, too. They all chased me. I believe it. Thank you. Oh, you're warm! What are you doing home from school so early? I'm not feeling real good. Paula? You better go. All right, you first. Hello? Mama? Oh, honey! I was afraid you didn't get our letter. Oh, Mama, we miss you so much. Oh, I miss you, too, honey. I'm gonna be picking you up in two weeks. So, how's everything going there? Well, Gertrude's awful strict, Mama. We got in a whole lot of trouble. What do you mean? Did she punish you? What, have those girls been gettin' in trouble again? She got mad 'cause your check's late. Our check was late? No, it wasn't. Let me talk to her. We gotta go. Sylvia? Sylvia! They're coming, Mama. Calling your boyfriend, Sylvia? No. I mean, nobody special. It was our parents. Thank you, Jennie. Where'd you get the money to make a long distance call? I went bottle-picking in the park and traded them in. Honest, that's all she did. What's she gonna do? What she always does when she catches you stealing. Are you gonna lie to me again? No, Gertie. You gonna steal in this household? I didn't steal from you, Gertie. Are you gonna call your parents and whine that Gertie doesn't treat you right? No, ma'am. Okay. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! No! Okay. Okay. That's a good girl. That's a good girl. You want to put some ice on that. Now, I think you stated, Marie, that your sister Paula, you volunteered, that Paula was jealous of Sylvia? Every time she looked at her, her eyes looked like she hated her. Do you know what the word jealous means? Angry at someone? Can you assign a reason as to why Paula might shoot Sylvia those angry, jealous glances? I guess because Sylvia thought she was so much more important than Paula was. Do you remember a time you went to Bethany Baptist Church and they had little sandwiches and something to drink? Haven't seen you at Youth Group in a few weeks. Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Orbach, I had to work. What happened to your arm, Paula? I lost my temper. With Sylvia. Well, what do you mean? What happened? She's been doing some real terrible things. Had to be real strict with her. Oh, it's okay, it's okay. Come on. Don't take too much. What are you doing here? Came by for the free food. And the women. I hope you don't want any money, because until John Senior sends me... I'm not here for money. Bradley sent me. About Paula. Did you say hi to the baby yet? Uh-uh. Look, about yesterday... It's fine. I'm really... It's all right. Mama'll be back end of this week. Hey. Hi. Couple of my friends, we're eating over there, if you want to join us. Sure. Okay. Sylvia. Just one second. Yeah, I'll be over there. Ricky, you know what I said the other day about Paula? Did you say something? No. 'Cause people are talkin', and Stephanie and Paula, they're blamin' me. No, no. I wouldn't do something like that. I better go. They're saying she's pregnant? I bet he'd be willing to pay for the abortion if... Shut up! Keep your voice down, please. If Paula's willing to go through with it. Anything to keep it quiet. Here. There's not gonna be any abortion, because she's not pregnant. He didn't even know about it. I think Sylvia's the one saying it. That girl has been nothing but trouble since she came into my house. If anybody's pregnant, she is. I bet she is. I'm gonna take off. Bye, Kenny. Bye. He'll be back, baby. Hey. Coming over to hang out with the grownups? I got some advice for you. I wouldn't come between Gertie and her kids. She don't like it much. All right. Okay, Gertie? Yeah. I'm fine. A bunch of us're gonna go cruise the circle. You want to come with? I should probably ask Gertie first. You sure? Come on, let's get out of here. Looks like Sylvia's going off with them boys. You sound surprised, Ricky Hobbs. You shouldn't be. Let me go again. Okay, Patty, you can go now. Sure you can't come to the drive-in with us? No, I... I'm late as it is. Come on. Well, I guess I'll see you next Sunday, then. Shut that door. I thought I taught you a lesson. I don't understand. Apparently, you've been telling more lies about my daughter. I haven't told any lies. And then you flirt with Andy. I didn't. I saw you! It doesn't matter what you want, you'll just... You'll just go take it! No, Gertie. We were just talkin'. That's all. Who's in charge here? You are, Mama. That's right, baby. Paula told me about those boys in California. Ricky, did Sylvia tell you about all those boys in California? No. Well, if you won't listen, maybe I can get through to your sister. Keep her from making your mistakes. Jennie. Do you wanna be like your sister? No, ma'am. That's a good girl. Patty, then what did Mrs. Baniszewski do? She handed her the bottle and told her to pull up her skirt. And then? And then, she said to put it up her. Did Sylvia say anything when Mrs. Baniszewski asked her to do this? All she said was... I can't. What did Mrs. Baniszewski say? She said... Come on. You can do better than that. Then what did Sylvia do? What Gertie told her to. Oww! What the hell's going on? Somebody clean up that mess! Sylvia, get upstairs. Coy, get her up there! Wait! I will not have her in the same room with my daughters. Take her to the basement. Please. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Jennie! Jennie! I'm sorry! Get her out of here! Best to stay out of it, I think. Don't worry, Jennie. Mama's just teaching her. She won't go down! I don't care! Just push her! Hey, Marie! Sylvia. Sylvia. I'm sorry, Sylvia. But I'm scared. I... I tried talking with Gertie. She... she said you could have your Bible. Jennie, Mama wants you upstairs. Family meeting. I'll do what I can. She said now. Stop hitting me! Give it to me! John, get me my medicine, please. Oh, this neighborhood, it's not good for my asthma. Maybe we could move. Where would we move to, Shirley? I don't know. I don't wanna move. I had a call with your parents today. Are they coming for us? They picked up the Florida leg of the circuit, so they won't be here for you until the end of November now. Their checks are comin' in regular, but my ironing's slowed down quite a bit. So we're all gonna have to work together as a family. Maybe I can eat more at Coy's house, Mama. That might help. Coy? Mama won't mind. She likes Stephanie a lot. Thank you. Paula. Baby, you're gonna have to pick up more shifts at work. Maybe quit Tech for a while. What about Stephanie? Why does she get to go to school? 'Cause she's smarter than you! Shut up, Johnny. I'm smarter than the both of you! Stop it! Y'all stop it! That's another thing we have to work on around here. We all have to learn to get along better. How long until Sylvia's out of the basement? Until she learns her lesson. Mama. She needs to be punished, Paula. Yes, Mama. Now, if anybody asks, Sylvia had to go to Juvenile. You got that, Jennie? Okay. That's it. Are you asleep? You okay? It's only gonna be for a little while. Did you ever hear or see Sylvia talk back to any of these people when these things were being done to her? No, I never. When it first started, did she say anything then? No, except she would say "I'm sorry," or something like that, as if she did something wrong, but she never did anything wrong. Did you yourself on any of these occasions do anything to Sylvia? I just did what I was told. During the month of September, did you see anyone else do anything to Sylvia? See, I told you so. Damn! What'd she do? She's been real bad. She's dirty. Mama said she's a slut. Johnny! Don't worry about it. She's used to it. Watch this. Nice, huh? You just burn her like that? Yeah. You can, too. I don't want to. You chicken? It's okay. Mama said we can. Did you see Sally take cigarettes and actually burn Sylvia with them? Yes. How many times? She would do it every time she came over. And how many times would that be? Every day. Did you go to 3850 East New York Street during the months of September and October? Yes, sir. We would go most days after school. And did you see Sylvia Likens in the basement of that house? Yes, sir. Did you do anything at all to help her? No, sir. What would the other children be doing around the house? Playing around. Did you tell the other kids they should come over to the house because everyone was having fun with Sylvia? I just thought we were punishing her. Where was John standing when he was washing her down? Right in front of her. What part of her body was he spraying? All over. Whose hose was he using? My hose, sir. Sally, did you see some of the other neighborhood kids hurt Sylvia? Yes. Did you tell anybody you saw these things? Not really. You told no one what was happening at the Baniszewski house? Well, I told my father Gertrude gave Sylvia an awful whipping. But he just told me I shouldn't do whatever she did or I'd get the same. Shirley, was your mother ever present while other people did things to Sylvia? Yes, she was. How many times? She was around about all the time. And what did she say when these... The people were doing things to Sylvia? Nothing. Did anyone order you to hit Sylvia? No, sir. Or tie her up? No, sir. Or wash her down? No, sir. Then why did you do it, Teddy? I don't know, sir. I don't know, sir. I don't know, sir. You two go upstairs. Yes, Mama. Who is it? You got any cigarettes? Heard anything from Sylvia? You really like her, don't you? She's no good for you, honey. Do you know when she's gonna be back? Ricky, I told you, she won't have anything to do with you. She's too busy with other boys. That's why I had to send her to juvie. There. Go on. Get. Here's your money. Thank you, baby. Paula. Honey, you are a good daughter. I'm so proud of you. Doesn't matter what people say. You've been holdin' your head up high. We're gettin' through this. What about Sylvia? Mama. I've been prayin' and I think maybe it's time to forgive her. I think she's learned her lesson. There are things in life we have to do, whether we like it or not. Well, I don't want any part of it. Paula. Paula? Come down here and talk to me! Sylvia. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. I know what it's like to be sick, Sylvia. I've been sick for so long, too. I can't discipline my kids the way that I should. I punish them, I know, but... Sometimes with my medicine, it gets so I don't know what I'm doing. And I care for them so much. And Paula, the thing is that... Paula's a lot like me. I had her when I was just about your age. And then it was Stephanie. And then all the others. Then John left. And here I am. I'm still doing everything I can to keep my family together. I want something better for Paula. There has to be something better. And I need to protect my children. Do you understand that? You kids, you're all I've got. Thank you, Sylvia. Thank you. Thank you for understanding. Oh, for... okay. Hello, Reverend. I've been meaning to come by and visit, but when Paula came to the church to talk to me, it just pushed me a little. Well, what's that girl been bothering you with? Well, she's concerned about you, of course. And the whole house. And, um, there is something else. I think Paula may be pregnant. Now, I'm prepared to offer what support I can, but I can't speak for the entire congregation. Reverend, I'm sorry. Thank you, but that is a vicious lie and a rumor spread by that Likens girl. Gertrude, Paula talked to me herself. I don't understand that. I'll try to get to the bottom of that with Paula. Sylvia's been a very bad influence on her since she came to my house, and I have... uh, I just cannot discipline that girl. Well, she did mention Sylvia as well. It wasn't clear, but she said there were some problems, and I haven't seen Sylvia in church in weeks, so I thought I should just sit down and talk with her. I'm afraid I had to send her to Juvenile. I just could not handle that girl. I caught her stealing from me... Have you spoken to her parents? I tried. I wrote them. I called. I haven't gotten a response. Frankly, I now understand why they just dropped her with me. I see. I should just go by the Juvenile Center and speak to Sylvia myself. I'll try and arrange that. Hi, Reverend Bill. Hi, Reverend Bill. Hey, kids. Will you just see to little Kenny, please? We can continue this discussion later. Thank you, Reverend. I'll see you on Sunday, then. I'm expecting you in my office before the end of the week. We need to talk about this. Yes, Reverend. Okay, Gertrude. Don't you have any sense? I'm doing this for you! You let go of me! I want everybody in the basement! Please! You know why you're here, Sylvia! Ricky. She came back. She came back from Juvenile and started stirring up trouble again. Stop! Johnny, hold her! Stop, please! Please! Keep her still! Sylvia, if you move, it'll only be messy. Light that. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Please! Please! Please! Stop it! Do we got it right, Mama? Make sure it's hot! I'm sorry! You're a liar. No! No! Please, no, please! Please! You branded my daughter! Now I have to brand you. Ricky! Finish this. Gertie, I can't. Ricky, she's been with every boy but you! You can't let her get away with this. Please! Please, help me, Ricky. Please! Please! That's a good boy. Ricky. Ricky. Ricky! What does it say? It says, "I'm a prostitute, and proud of it." No, don't! Stop! Sylvia. You've gotta get out of here. You've gotta leave. You've gotta get out of here. Come on! Shh. Mama? We gotta get out of here. We're gonna find your parents. Jennie? I'm gonna take care of Jennie. Paula? No! Go! Go! Just go! What are you doing? Let me go! What's going on? Come on. Let's go in the house. Sylvia! Oh. Please. Please, help me. No, I'm not gonna hurt you. I swear to God. I promise, I promise. I'm sorry. I didn't know what the hell I was doing, all right? You gotta believe me. Please! Please! You wanna get out of here? You wanna go? Let's go. Come on. Come on, you're all right. Where're we going? I don't know. The Police? You wanna go to the Police? We can tell them everything. I gotta get to my mom. Where's your mom at? I think she's in Portage. We're going to Portage. Dammit! Ricky! Ricky! We're going! I'll come with you. No, you gotta get back. You gotta get back to Jennie and make sure nothing happens to her. I won't let her out of my sight. Thank you, Ricky. Thank you. Daddy? Cookie? What are you doing here? Oh, baby, what happened to you? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! They did this to you? I'm so, so sorry. I'm just so sorry I left you there. We spoke to Jennie on the phone last week. She said everything was fine. She's scared of her. And we gotta get back. Let's just talk in the car. Everything's gonna be taken care of, Cookie. You're with your family now. I want... Mama's gonna take care of you. Hey, honey, we're here. You stay here, Cookie. Uh-uh. I gotta do this. I just gotta go in. She's not breathing, Mama! We'll wake her up, okay? Don't worry, she's faking. Please wake up, please! Stephanie? She's not breathing! She's faking, honey. Somebody please do something! She's not breathing! Johnny, where's that water? Will you bring me some water, baby? Give me! Please, somebody! She's not breathing! Liar. Liar. Liar. Liar. Mama, she's not faking it! She came into my house and just told lies. Stephanie, what's wrong? Mama, we gotta do something! She's... No, she's... Breathe, Sylvia! Please, breathe! Sylvia. Shirley, it'll be okay. Somebody please do something! She's not breathing! Shut up, Stephanie! She's lying! She's just been laying there. Oh, my God. Ricky, do something! Look out. Come on. Here, try this. Sylvia! Wake up! Come on, breathe! Paula, you go get Andy, baby. He'll know what to do, okay? Wake up! Sylvia! She'll be okay. She's just faking. Please, Sylvia, breathe! She's cold. Somebody better call the Police! Don't call the Police. Go! She's not dying! Get me more water. Babies, come here. She's lyin', baby. She's just... Mama, she's not faking it! I need the Police. Yeah, there may be a dead girl at a house. She's dead. Jesus, Gertie. What's the problem? Get me out of here and I'll tell you everything. Jennie, did you ever see Sylvia do anything to Mrs. Baniszewski? No, I didn't see her do anything. Did you ever see her do anything to Paula? No. Did you ever see her do anything to Johnny Baniszewski? Jennie, you saw your sister being hit, beaten, struck. Why did you not call the Police? Well, um, Gertie threatened me that if I told anybody, I'd get the same treatment Sylvia was getting. You could've told anyone up and down that street. I was scared. And I guess I just did what she told me, and I wish I hadn't. Did you ever see Sylvia cry? They said she didn't have no feelings, but I knew better. I'd seen her cry before. But I imagine the reason why she didn't cry was because she didn't have enough water. The trial lasted 24 days. Gertrude was the last one to take the stand. What was your physical condition in July and August of last year? Pretty run down, physically. Pretty upset mentally and emotionally. What do you mean? If you have as many children around your home all the time as I did, arguing and carrying on, you'd be pretty upset mentally and emotionally, too. What medicine did you take? Phenobarbital sulfate and, uh, Coricidin. I was trying to take care of myself because I could not afford to go to a doctor. Now then, getting to the first week of September, was there any change in your physical condition or in the condition of that house? No, sir. What about the third week of September? Do you remember that? You mean anything specific that might happen in September? Yes. Anything specific. The kids were fighting a lot. The kids were fighting a lot? My children and the neighbor children were coming in and fighting Sylvia. My children fighting other children, so on, so forth. What did you do when they were fighting? I did not see this fighting. I... was barely able to stay up at all. I did not even feel like getting up. Did you have any knowledge of any mistreatment going on towards Sylvia? No, sir. Did you commit any indignity? Make any marks on that girl's body? No, sir. Do you know how those wounds got on her body? No, sir. You're telling the jury that you don't know who did it? No. Did you hear the testimony of Jennie? Yes, I did. Did you hear some of your children state that before Sylvia died, you started branding this girl? Yes, I heard that. Did they all lie? That is right. The fact is you're lying, isn't it? No, sir. Did you hear John Baniszewski state that you burned her with matches and cigarettes? Yes, I heard that statement. Did he tell the truth? He is not telling the truth. No. You're saying you did not do it. That's right. You were in bed a great deal of the time and the children were doing things you did not know they were doing. I imagine they were doing a great deal of things that I did not know. Why did John lie? I imagine that he is a pretty scared little boy. Are you scared? I have been scared about a lot of things for a long time. She sacrificed me to protect her children and sacrificed them to protect herself. Will the defendant please rise. "We, the jury, find Gertrude Baniszewski "guilty of first-degree murder, sentencing her to life in prison." The case got a lot of attention. Even made Time magazine. At least people started talking about things they used to ignore. Thank you. The others were tried later. Paula was found guilty as an accomplice and served a couple of years. She had that baby, and named it Gertrude. Johnny was convicted, too. He became the youngest inmate in the history of the Indiana State Reformatory. He went on to become a lay minister. A way to tell his story, I guess. Ricky Hobbs was found guilty of man-slaughter and he served time in the reformatory. He died at age 21 of lung cancer. Coy also served a couple years. He went on to a life of crime and was in and out of prison. I don't know what happened to any of the rest of them. Mama and Daddy went back on the road and they left Jennie with the District Attorney and his family. They helped her get back on her feet. Gertrude served 20 years of that sentence. She was released on parole in 1985. Before she died, five years later, she took responsibility for everything that had happened. Sorry. And me, I returned to the carnival. The one place I always felt safe. Reverend Bill used to say, "With every situation, God always has a plan." I guess I'm still trying to figure out what that plan was.
