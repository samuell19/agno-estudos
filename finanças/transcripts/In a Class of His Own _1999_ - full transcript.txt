We have a real situation. I repeat, we have a real situation! Shut down all access ways out. The last thing I need is a riot on my hands. Nobody gets in or out. Do I make myself clear? Sector one, do you copy? Repeat, do you copy? You'd better get a move on, sir. Looks like things may get out of hand down here. Copy. Damn these animals. We all know that was an accident. What is the meaning of this? Come on, skip. You know, I was just busting some old school moves for the kids, you know? There are several things we must address here. First, don't call me skip, address me as Mr. Jordan in front of the students. Second, music is not permitted on the school grounds. That's not my rule. I love the beat. Third, why don't you do what you were hired for, like push a broom or slosh a mop around? Keep the place clean, okay? My office is open for the next half hour. Feel free to pop in. Bust a move. Yeah. [ Speaking Spanish ] Hey, what did I tell you about cursing around here, huh? I know it's the last Baton... Bastion. Of a person who can't find the right words to use in a time of a heated moment, and besides, it makes you sound stupid. So listen, come by my office tomorrow morning, I'll fix your radio for you. All right? All right. Thanks, rich. Hey, babe, you home? Sherry? What? You're not feeling any better? Better than yesterday, but worse than this morning. Go see Dr. Kreigel. Rich, I'm fine. It's just this bug that everyone at work has. Three-day thing. It'll be gone tomorrow. Stop Hawking me, okay? I'm fine. I could fix you a little dinner? You know, I could make you my world-famous tuna casserole. No tuna. Some green peas in there? No. Maybe a little creamed corn? Uh-uh. A little cornflake topping? Oh, god. So that would be a "no" on the tuna. So, did you fix it? Quarter, please. Uh, come on, rich-- uh-uh-uh, a quarter. But... I swore in Spanish. That shouldn't count. All right. Okay, now that I'm a rich man, how's everything with your father? Stepfather. Okay, I guess. Still looking for a gig. I'm sure Alberto is trying, okay? You've got to cut him some slack. This can't be easy for him. Are we cool? Huh? Yeah, we're cool. Now, do me a favor. Mellow out on that volume button, okay? Okay. Done. Thanks for hooking me up. Here you go. Why don't you get some different kind of music? What's wrong with my music? All that gangster stuff, it's got all that cursing. Cursing? Damn, that boy is fine. Ka-ching! Hey, sorry. What's up? Oh, god! You know, I don't care, because he's worth the fee. Stay out of Jordan's hair, all right? Thanks, guys. You okay? No, I'm not. If you could give me a hand, that would be great. What do you need? Well, besides a higher g.P.A., a full ride to Michigan, and a little help on my outside j, I'd settle for directions to miss ching's class. Oh, you're in Linda's class. This way. All right. I'll tell you what, man, this school is so much bigger than my old school in L.A. Oh, Mr. Hollywood, what brings you up here? It was actually my dad. He got transferred again, you know? Every six months, new zip code, new school. It's kind of this ongoing process. Yeah, well, you know, you're going to dig it here. You know, it's a good bunch of kids. Yeah? How long have you been in special... What did you say you taught? I didn't. Didn't what? Didn't say I taught. I'm the custodial engineer. Really? You mean like a janitor? Exactly like a janitor. Come on. All right, all right, everybody, this is Jake, uh... What is that? Matteson. Matteson. Jake matteson. He's a transfer in from L.A. Don't hold that against him. Rich? I think, um, there's a seat back here. If he needs a seat. Oh, okay. Thanks. Hi. How are you doing? All right, you two, okay. You get acquainted later. All right, where's miss ching? Uh, she got called away for a minute. Oh, so you guys just thought it was free time, huh? You were dancing in the cafeteria. That's right-- in the cafeteria, but a classroom is a place to expand your mind, okay? So come on here, guys, open your books to where miss ching left off. Yo, Brady, hook me up. What are you guys studying? Square roots, common denominators, the usual. The usual. What page? 217. Okay, it says here that a square root is the, um... A denominator is what? A base number? Okay. Okay, good, good, so if you have a base number of... Hey, retards 101, you learn the alphabet yet or what? Okay, forget about it. Let's talk about, uh... Hey, rich. Oh, hey. Miss ching. Hey, I was just... I was just keeping them sharp till you got back. Thanks. Thanks, rich. Okay. Hey, you guys, you, uh... Keep those denominators common. I'm out of here. Oh, man. What do you know about basketball? All you do is bust people's lips. You shouldn't be on the courts with that weak-ass team. Enough. Now, Mr. Guitterez, fighting again, good move. I'm sure your parents will be thrilled to have you spend the next two weeks at home. I heard it over the radio. I thought you might use a little help. I'm fine, thanks. I want to talk to rich. Pardon me. I want to talk to rich. I'm the guidance counselor here. I know that, Mr. Jordan. Look, I just want to deal with rich. I want rich as my lawyer. Don't push your luck. You're coming with me. Guitterez, I'll deal with you later. Are you trying to get me in trouble, too? Oh, that burns, man. Oh, you think so? Yeah, it hurts. Oh, great. Is this fun for you? You want to come in here and shoot hoops in my trash can? You know, you split that kid's lip open, you're whining about a little alcohol on your arm. Come on, i-- don't interrupt me. You think you're going to just walk through life being this tough guy with a mediocre j? Mediocre? Let me tell you something, my man. You're going to try and step through the wrong guy, and he's going to dust you, kid, all right? There's always someone out there tougher, meaner, and don't care about pulling the trigger. You're just another statistic, yo. All right, go on, get out of here. I'll talk to Jordan for you. All right. There's no way I can be suspended. Oh, no, you're out of here, dude. What? I'll try to get him down to a week, okay? Hi, excuse me, do you mind if I sit down? Please. Don't mean to interrupt. I just wanted to thank you for taking it easy on guitterez. He's kind of going through a bad time at home right now. I don't know if you're aware of, you know, what's going on with him with his mother leaving and all-- of course I know that. Yeah. Yeah, divorce can be kind of-- I know what divorce can be, rich. Oh, okay. Well, thanks. You have a good day. Thanks. You too. Man, get out of here. I've got next. Man, I said get out of here. I said I've got next. Pick that guy out, man. How you doing, buddy? I said I've got next. Next. Man, we could have used you last year. Man, we went 3 and 12. Can you believe that? Actually, I didn't play last year. I messed up my knee pretty bad. You're going to try out for the team here, right? I don't know, man. My knee's still messed up. Besides, I just transferred over here. It's crazy right now. Well, who've you got? Uh... You know, man, I forgot. You forgot? Y'all, the school's big, but it's not that big. Um, it's an Asian teacher. Mr. Lee? Yeah. Good. Man, for a second there, I thought you were going to say miss ching's class. The retards 101. Nah. Anyways, man, I've got to get out of here. I'll catch up with you guys later. Good run, man. Good run. You've really got game. You've got serious ups for days. Yeah? Yeah. Thanks. Um, listen, I've got to get out of here. I've got to get home. What's your deal? My deal? Yeah, superstar athlete kicking it in special ed. What gives? There was just trouble with my transcripts, you know, transferring over and all. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, sure. No, I'm serious. We move a lot. Oh, you move a lot. Yeah, it's my dad. He's got to work. Lucky him. Listen, you want to go get a slice or something? Yeah, I mean... No. I mean I want to with you, but we've got the test and stuff tomorrow... Oh, that's cool. Okay, well, you know, maybe another time. Okay. I'd like that. That'd be cool. Okay, well, I guess I'll see you around. All right. Um, marcella? I've got a couple hours, and if you're still hungry, for food, for pizza. Yeah. Yeah? Okay. Freddy... Just sit down over there. I just want to say thanks again for looking out for me, and... I'm a good worker, uncle skip, and mom said that you were the best one to help me. Rich donato to biology lab one. Rich donato to biology lab one. Tell you what, Freddy, come back in a couple of days. I'll see what I can do. Trash cans. You guys hear of trash cans? You know, I... I've been thinking. You could just do me a little bit of a favor. Well, that depends, all right, what's up? Well, when I transferred over, obviously, some of my grades got lost, and the school board has clearly put me in the wrong class. Don't get me wrong, miss ching, she's fantastic, but it's just... I don't belong in that classroom with them. Them? Yeah, you know, the speds. You know, I don't care what your grade point average is, and I don't mind that you're in Linda's class, but don't you ever, ever call those kids speds again, because no matter what you're trying to sell me, you're sitting in that classroom with them. So what's the deal? Will you say anything or not? I've got no reason to. I'd have more respect for you if you'd told me the truth. Rich, I'm telling you the truth. No problem. I am! Then if you're so smart, buddy, then why the hell are you the janitor? Huh? Huh? Hey. Hey! Let me tell you something, all right? I know how those kids feel sitting in that classroom every day, every day! It's not what you are that matters, kid, it's who you are, all right? I know this firsthand. I hope those grades show up soon. Dammit! I hate this place. Hey, guitterez, what's up? What's up, Ricardo? Hey, Jake, what rock have you been hiding under? You know. No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking. I've been busy, all right? Guitterez, we should go. We've got that game over at Lincoln. Okay. Hi, rich. This was in my mailbox by mistake. School board? What are they writing to me for? Probably an award for all the work you do with the kids. Oh, yeah, probably. So what does it say? Um... You were right. I can't believe it. They, uh, they want to honor me with an award. That's fantastic. I'm going to go tell everybody. No, no, please, please, I want to keep this a secret. Yeah, you. So modest. See you. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, my god. [ Telephone ringing ] Hello? Sher, it's me. I was just thinking about you. Hey, guess what? Can you get down to Franklin park asap? What are you doing in Franklin park? I couldn't really come home. Can you just get down here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, I'll be right there. Rich? Rich, are you okay? Oh, Sherry. I am so screwed, you know? I am so unbelievably screwed. Whoa, hold on, bub, take it down a notch. If you want to talk, let's talk, if you want to redecorate the park, then I'm out of here. So? It's no big deal. Sherry, do you realize what this letter says? It's come to the attention of the school board that you don't have your high school diploma. Exactly. So now what? So now you, according to this letter, have 30 days to get your g.E.D. Come on, you can do this. How? How am I supposed to pass this test in one month? What if the kids find out? This makes me the biggest fraud. All I ever tell them is how important it is to study, how important it is to get a good education, you know, to go to college, and the truth is, all I've got is a 10th-grade education. I couldn't even tell them what a denominator was. How am I supposed to pass this test? I read this letter, Sherry, and I wanted to die, you know? I never should have taken that plant manager's test. How am I supposed to walk back into that high school? Now, you tell me, because I don't know. Rich, kids half your age take this kind of test every week. How hard could it be? Rich, it says right here all you need is an 81 to pass. An 81, rich. Walk in, take the test, get your 81, you walk out. When you walked out of ps-83, you never thought it would catch up to you? Why now? Why not now? It did, and that's it. End of story. Everything happens for a reason, rich. Everything. So just step up. You want some help? No, no, I've got to do this on my own. Okay. I could quiz you or something. Sherry, I appreciate it, I do, I do, it's just that when I go into that room, no one's going to be there but me. Sure thing. No prob. Um, what's the square root of 144? You're killing me. I'm just protecting my assets here, rich. If you don't pass this test, then we're both screwed. Now what is the square root of 144? And don't tell me you need to do this on your own. Check that macho crap at the door. 12. The square root of 144 is 12. You're beautiful. You're not getting extra credit for this. Get back to work. Okay. You are going to be fine. An 81 is like a "b". A very low "b," even. Okay, save it. No pep talks right now. Okay. I'm going to throw up. I can do this. Yes, okay, you've got your pencils? Check. Erasers? All right. Okay. All right. Okay. 81. 81. Okay. Rock on, donato. All right. Okay. No way, dude. It's rich, right? Yeah, that's me. I knew it, man. This is such a trip, huh? It's me, Charlie zaken. Charlie zaken? Dude, I used to be the biggest pain in the ass. Oh... For your jar, right? Yeah. Right on, man. So, hey, hang on, what are you doing in here, man? It's um... Something with the school board screwing up my transcripts. Oh. Political thing, huh? Yeah, exactly, it's political. I kind of got screwed once I got into high school, man, you know, partying too much, and that whole thing, whatever. Man, I'm going to nail this bad boy today. I've got to do it. I've got to get into community college. I've got a baby on the way. Man, I can't believe I'm sitting here with you. It's so trippy. Damn school board, huh? I guess they, like, never stop screwing with you and stuff. Well, look, Charlie, the school board didn't screw up. I dropped out, too. You're a flunkie, too. I got you. No. I just dropped out. Hey, I didn't mean anything by it. That's cool, that's cool, it just kind of snuck up on me, that's all. Show time. Good morning. My name is Vincent Lexington, and welcome to your high school equivalency exam. To answer your earlier question, the g.E.D. Is taken by over 700,000 people a year, so you are not alone. This will be a five-part test taken over the next five hours. Each section will be timed, and please don't open your booklets until I instruct you to do so. When I say "next section," you must move on, if you want to complete the exam. I want to wish all of you tremendous success. You may begin the first section... Now. Time. Please begin the next section now. Time. Please put down your pencils and pass your exams to the front of the room. Yeah. Hey, test's over, dude, pass it up. Oh, yeah, sure thing. So how'd you do? I don't know. Probably, uh... I don't know. There will be a one-hour recess. If you would like your results, please be back by then, otherwise, they will be mailed out to you. Hey, Mr. Donato-- I mean, rich-- I want you to meet my girl, Mimi. Oh, hey, nice to meet you. You too. Charlie told me you used to go to school together. Um, yeah, kind of. Did Charlie tell you this is, like, his ninth time taking the test? So I totally hope he passes this one. How'd you do? Oh, you know, I didn't exactly ace it, but all you need is an 81, so I mean, how hard could that be? You get 10 points for spelling your name correctly. So... Results are in. Okay. Yo, hey, good luck. Yeah, you, too. Nice to meet you. You, too. See you. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck. I can't look. Come on, lay it on me. Let's go. Damn, Charlie, 59. What? Uh, no big deal. I mean, 10th time's a charm, right, man? I've got to go. Hey, sorry about that. Keep your head up. Rich? I've got to lock up. Yeah, yeah, sure thing. Couldn't sleep? Scootch. God, nice hair. Great tux. Me? Look at you. You look like you're on your way to a wang chung concert. I was cutting edge. You know, I looked hot, baby. Oh, god, maybe not that hot. I can't do it, you know? Do what? Pass that test. Of course you can. You just have to study harder next time. Oh, hey, did Bobby ever get out of jail? It's not going to make any difference. What? You're just going to Chuck it after one try? That's real smart, rich. I could get a job at my uncle Joe's garage. And then what? That's going to make you happy, rebuilding carburetors? The money's good. Big deal. You think the money's going to make it all right? Don't try and snow me, donato. You don't work at that school for the money. You know it and I know it. I'm just a bum. You're not a bum. I sat next to this kid who remembered me from, like, 10 years ago. Oh, hold on a sec. I think I left the violin in my other robe. Come on, Sherry, this is serious. Come on. You don't think I know that, rich? You've got three weeks to pass this test. Three weeks to succeed. This test is hard, sher, okay? Real hard. The questions are like 10 minutes long. By the end, I forget the beginning. "If you take a train from Paris to London" kind of stuff. I mean, who cares, you know? I don't know how long it takes. I don't care about that stuff. You'd better start caring because no one said this was going to be easy. Well, you're not the one who has to take it. You're not the one who's got to sit in that room. No, I am the one who married Mr. Mall head whose best man fenced our wedding gift, so if we could get through that, this is cake. Morning, rich. Good morning, Marcy. Rich, can I ask you something? I really don't have time right now. But, rich, this is really important. Make an appointment with Jordan. I don't have time right now. Just go see Jordan, all right? That's his job. Hey. Hey. Um, listen, I just want to apologize to you because I've been acting like a real loser and... I don't care about that. Yeah, I know, it's just, uh... My transcripts, they weren't lost. You see, um... I'm supposed to be in miss ching's class, and it's just every time I move, I've got to go through the same thing over again, it must be tough. Yeah, it is. I mean, it sucks. I've been in remedial my whole life, and I'm at this point where I'm really sick of having to defend myself, you know? Yeah. Yeah, sure I do. You know, Jake, you've got to be honest with yourself because, I'll tell you, you never know when it's going to come back. Yeah. So, uh, then we're cool, right? Yeah, of course we're cool. All right, man, I was a bit worried about that. [ Bell ringing ] Divorced. Of course I knew that. Hey, rich, you got some stuff for jelly? Rich? Application for current plant manager. Unable to process your file. It's come to our attention... No high school diploma. This is too good. [ Metal clanging ] Oh! Geez, Freddy. You scared the hell out of me. I'm sorry. You told me to meet you here at 8:00. Yes, 8:00, but not here. My office. Let's go. Come on. Hey, rich. Rich, look... Hey, look, I know you're probably busy, man, but marcella, she never showed up for school today. Yes, she did. I saw her this morning. Yeah, I know, so did I, but she never made it to class. Well, maybe she's just ditching. I don't know, man, when I saw her, she was all freaked out about her stepdad or something. Stepdad? Yeah. All right. I think I know where she is. Cool. Let's go get her. You stay here. I can't take you off campus. Rich, it's lunch time. Who's going to know? Forget about it. Don't touch that. Rich, okay-- just sit there, okay, no talking. You like this music? No talking, no touching. I don't suppose it'll do any good to tell you to stay in the car, huh? Uh, no. So I can talk now, right? Good. Where are we going? Right over here. I tell you about my secret place, you steal it from me? Get out of here. I don't want to talk to you. You know, you guys have got to understand, and I know this may be hard for you to believe, but, you know, I've got a life outside of school, too, okay? So, come on, start talking, sister. We're moving. Where? When? Two months. My stepfather got some stupid job in wilsonville. Well, that's great. No, it sucks, rich. I've got to leave my friends, you know? The school, my whole life. Marcy, I know it's tough, but, you know, the man finally got a job, you know? He's going to be able to take care of you and your family. This is a big deal for him. I know that, rich. Trust me, I do. You're not the one that's got to move. Hey. Hey. Look at me. Listen, I've moved, like, five times in the past two years. You get used to it. All right, all right. Okay, all right. You know, I hate to break up this hallmark moment, you know, but you're giving me a cavity. Come on, children, let's go. Field trip's over. Hello, Freddy, it's uncle skip. I think I'm on to something. Yes, with benefits. Okay, then, you take care. Oh, Freddy, tell your mom. Okay, bye. This is a very, very, very important shot. Do you think you're helping me? You're like a gnat. You're like a mosquito here. I like the drama. I like the drama. You think you've got me? You've got nothing, okay? I'm the king. I'm untouchable. You don't impress me. I laugh at you and your weak skills. What did you say? That was a lucky shot. You know, you're lucky I don't entirely understand what you just said. I love it when you talk dirty. Stop it. All right, here we go. I'm feeling your vibes. I'm picking them up. Shoot the ball. All right, Jake, listen, here, take this shot. You need the practice. Hey, Linda? Hey, rich. She's very good, isn't she? She hangs tough, that one. If the school board knew all you did-- that's, that's, uh... Kind of what I want to talk to you about. Is there a teacher confidentiality thing, you know, like what people have with their shrinks? I don't know, why? Because what I have to tell you is real confidential. Go ahead, you have my trust. Well, you know that letter I got from the school board wasn't exactly to honor me. It was to let me know that they were aware that I don't have a high school diploma. Not like I had one or I lost it. I mean... I never graduated from high school... And if I don't get one or a g.E.D., I'm going to lose my job. Okay, so what do you want to do about this? Well, I tried to take the test myself, but I bombed, you know? You need an 81 to pass... What did you get? 41. Okay. How much time do you have to pass the test? Uh, three weeks. I've got three weeks. Okay, so meet me after school in my classroom. We'll start today. Thank you. Thanks. Okay. Oh, listen, the kids can't know about this, okay? I won't say a word. Don't worry. All right. All right. Hey, Marcy, I'm coming for you. Let's take the lesson you were teaching in here, okay? When adding fractions, with dissimilar base numbers, you must find the lowest common denominator in order to complete the equation. All right, you lost me somewhere between dissimilar and denominator. One over two, two over three. What is the common denominator? Rich, are you following? Five? Is that the common denominator? It's six. Oh, yeah, six, right. You know, I was going to say six, because, of course, five is the, uh... Have you ever, in the past, rich, been tested for any kind of learning disabilities? I could never follow along, you know? Keep up with the other students. My mind was always wandering. Not like I was daydreaming, just kind of tuning out. It just never held my attention. Not like other things, you know? And that's what I don't understand. I could work on a car for like, hours, not even be aware of the time that had passed. You know, like a whole day could go by, you know? But if it was something else, something that I couldn't grasp right away, then forget about it. I was lost in two minutes. Whoa, sorry. I didn't know you guys were in here. Um, I forgot to pick up my homework assignment. It's okay, go ahead. All right. Thanks. What are you still doing here, donato? Rich and I, we were having a conference about a student. About me? Maybe, you never know. Oh, why? What'd I do? Get out of here before you confess to something. Got you. See you later. Have you heard of a.D.D.? I'm sorry, did you say something? Attention deficit disorder. A.d.d.? It's a joke. Rich... Of course I've heard of it. I've also heard of dyslexia and a lot of other things. I mean, I know I've got certain problems that, you know, as a kid nobody wanted to talk about, including me and my folks, nobody. You just feel kind of stupid and that's that. You try not to get busted, but then that got to be too hard, so that's when I split. We'll just have to take it slow and break it into more pieces. We'll do this together. Good morning, rich. Good luck today. Thanks. Hey, how you doing today? You feeling good? Not bad. How are you? Good. Stand up straight. Okay, are you loose? All right. 10th time in here, baby. Double digits. I've got to pass. Okay. Time. Please put down your pencils and pass your exams to the front of the room. 73. Hey... Hey, how'd you do? Drive. Rich, come on. Drive! 50. A lousy 50, and that's with a tutor. A teacher couldn't help me pass. With the exception of god almighty coming down here and taking this test for me, I don't know what to do. There is still time. There is no time, Sherry. Time is up. I lose, okay, just admit it. Great. Great. I don't even have you in my corner anymore. Let's just go upstairs and pack. I don't want to see the kids' faces when they find out what happened to me. Why when you're this close do you want to quit? Close? Close to what, Sherry? A 50 is a million miles away from an 81. I've got to walk away now because...because that's my only choice I got left. I mean, let's just stop pretending, Sherry. I'm stupid. I'm goddamn stupid! You are not stupid, Richie. You made a decision a long time ago that may have been stupid, but you are not a stupid person. You quit. You walk out of that school, and nobody said a word. Nobody. You've got one more shot. You better take it, you hear me? So, come on. You're right. Let's go, rich, let's go pack. I wouldn't want you to have to face the embarrassment of the truth. So I'll grab a couple of boxes, and start packing. We could be out of here before school on Monday. Better yet, let's sneak out of town in the middle of the night. I am so tired of this song. Time to stop running, rich. I have been with you a long time. I love you, but for the first time, I've got to wonder, donato, if you think you can't do this, then neither do I. I've got to catch my breath. Are you okay? I just have to catch my breath. That's it. You're making an appointment with Dr. Kreigel. Rich-- Sherry, don't argue with me, okay? You've been sick for weeks. I know what's wrong. Actually, what's right. I'm pregnant, rich. We're going to have a baby. We're going to have a baby. That's great. That's amazing. I found out that the success rate is like, 12% on your first try. It's not great odds. So, how do we want to do this? Well... I think it should be at the school, at an assembly or something, and Wednesday nights, rich plays poker, so it should definitely be then. Okay, I'll arrange that. Sherry, are you aware rich suffers from a.D.D.? And what I can assess, a slight case of dyslexia. Yeah. We know that. You know, there are learning centers. He's trying real hard. I just think he needs some more help on the side. I'll get the parents and teachers. You take care of the rest. All right. My name is Linda ching. I'm a teacher at this school. Right now we're in the middle of a very difficult situation. One of our employees is being forced to resign. Why? What did he do? He didn't do anything, Mr. Guitterez. He never finished high school, and it is mandatory that all employees of the school district have a high school diploma. Who'd give a teaching job to a non-educated teacher? Are you telling US that a teacher has been teaching here without ever having finished high school? Actually, he's not a teacher. He's our janitor. Get out of here. Let's go. You dragged US down here so that some janitor could keep his job? Please. Please, please. Please wait, everyone, please. I'm Sherry donato. Most of you... All of you probably have no idea who I am, or who my husband is, for that matter. My husband, rich, is the janitor here. He's special. Not just to me, but to your kids. Lady, no offense, but he pushes a broom around. He doesn't just push a broom or clean up after them. He's there to listen and to lend a shoulder to cry on. Rich doesn't live in a world where people are judged by the number of diplomas hanging on the wall. He judges people by what's in their heart. I need your support to write letters to the school board, to the mayor, to anyone who'll listen. Rich has unsuccessfully taken the test. He's even had a tutor, and to be honest, I don't know if he'll be able to pass before the deadline. Let's go. Let's go. I'll help rich pass the test. Mrs. Donato, I'll help rich pass the test. I'll help rich pass the test, too. I'll help rich pass that test, Mrs. Donato. I'll help rich pass the test. I'll help rich pass this test. I'll help rich pass this test. And I'll help rich pass this test. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, everybody, he's coming. Hey, you guys. Hey, Jake, how's it going? What was the subject, object, and verb in that sentence, rich? Excuse me? What was the subject, object, and verb in that sentence? What? Are you yanking my chain? No, you're actually yanking ours. You're going to pass the test, rich. I don't know what you're talking about. Your g.E.D. You're going to get your high school diploma. We're going to make sure of it, man. You, rich donato, are going to score the highest score ever in high school history. You know why? Because we're all behind you. Okay. All right, okay. I don't know how you, uh... All right, thanks. Thanks. All right. Thanks. Thank you. I told you, I got that one, all right? H2o is water. I know that. Yeah, but how many parts hydrogen, how many parts oxygen? One part oxygen. The one in the middle right there, okay? All right, tough guy, but what about these little mouse ears on the side? Duh. It's hydrogen, all right? Two parts hydrogen. H2o. Very good. You're picking it up. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I'm going to miss you a lot, donato. I'll miss you, too. Miss you splashing around, sucker. Huh? There's your water. Your h2o, oh, what happened to you? Say hello to my little friend. Hey. Hey. This was a nice surprise. I didn't, you know, really feel like cooking dinner tonight, so... Well, you deserve it. We can't really afford this place. Really? Why not? I mean, after being tutored all day by a bunch of kids, set up by you. Kids? What are you talking about? Okay, fine, fine. Thanks. For whatever you didn't do. Thank you. I don't know what else to do, rich. Nowhere else to turn. We need... You need this job, and the kids are the best way-- well, you know, at this point, anything's worth a try. I just...I just, I don't want to disappoint them, you know? You just worry about passing that test. It's my last shot. Between the kids and their parents-- parents? Did I forget to mention that? How did that slip my mind? Sher. It must be the pregnancy. You know, raging hormones and all. What are they doing? Um, nothing really. Just writing a few letters. We should really order because I'm starving-- you know, eating for two now? Letters? Letters to who? I'm not really sure. I think to the school board, the newspaper, the governor. Whoo! I'm beat. Time to go freshen up. Maybe the president of the United States. Who knows? Donato! We're going to be all right, you know that? I know. All right, what'd you call me out here for, guitterez? Look, I don't got time for this. I've got to get back to work, all right? I'll play with you after school. I will school you after school. Well, rich, this ain't a game, man. It's a lesson. Oh, a lesson, huh? Yeah, a lesson in physics. Basketball is a game of physics. You've got shapes, force and velocity, man. Take the rock, for instance. The rock? The ball, man. Oh, the rock. All right, that's good, I like that. I got you, go ahead. Thanks. Anyway... Now, the ball is round, right? Now, the hoop, or the hole, is also round. Now, it seems the easiest thing in the world to put this round ball through that round hoop, but there's a lot of other factors. Take that backboard. The backboard is flat. If you put this ball off the glass, and if the shot and the velocity is off, the ball's not going to drop. You know what I'm saying? Or, put too much backspin on your j, the rim becomes a factor. Brick city, because the ball is spinning in the opposite direction that it's travelling in. You following me? All right, let me see if I understand this. If I lay my brick off the rock too hard, then the glass will affect my flow? No, no. Yank. All right, okay, it was a lucky shot. This guy's got the idea. Let's go. No, it was a lucky shot, guitterez, come on. Tell me one more time all about that velocity, huh? Forget about it, man. Hey, give me the ball. There's two seconds left on the clock. Donato waves off his teammates. He wants to go one-on-one with m.J., who came out of retirement just to play the man. His shot will give donato and the Knicks the best record in NBA history, not to mention a special g.E.D. Mvp award for donato. Come on... Drop, baby, drop. That rim must be bent. Taking a little break? I was just shooting some hoops. Taking a little breather. I'd love to take off and play ball. Let's go. A little on-one-on, huh? Yeah, nobody's going to know. Nah, I couldn't. I've got a meeting with Robbie Cayman, but I'll take a raincheck on that. Cool. Any time you want to play, skip. Oh, well then. Might be hard to drive in those wingtips, though. Okay, now, the a-bomb, right? Mm-hmm. Was invented by who? How? And, uh, when was it used? All right. The atom bomb was invented by and credited to j. Robert Oppenheimer... But the whole project was overseen by lots of military officials. Go on, there's more. Well, um... The bomb was invented when scientists were able to successfully split an atomic... Nuclei. Nuclei. In 1945, it was used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nice. Okay, just wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What were the nicknames of the bombs? I don't know, Joey and Eddie? How in the heck am I supposed to know that? You've got to know this stuff. What were they? Fat man... Little boy. Fat man, little boy. You got that? That was good. What exactly are you trying to say? Um...you're fat. Hey, rich. Aw, no more lessons, okay? My brain is sore. Nah, nah, no more lessons. You're all right. Okay, here it goes. Uh...i know what it's like to always have to hide from something, you know? Always feeling stupid and being called a spaz and a loser, and then... Look, I guess what I'm just trying to tell you is, uh... I'm really proud of you. Thanks, Jake. You know, when you first came into this school, you reminded me a lot of myself. That's why I busted your hump. But you got it going on. At the end of it all, you know, nothing is nothing if you don't believe in yourself. All right. All right, take care, you spaz. All right, you loser. There's so much to learn. It doesn't seem like nine months is even enough time. Yeah, well, try four weeks. Well, at least you're not going to be getting stretchmarks. You know, for the first time, I actually think I have a shot at passing this test. It's like, the kids, you know, they come at you from this place, this common ground. They just don't assume you know the answers like adults do. Yeah, well, you're just a big old kid anyway. Yeah, well, maybe that's why I can learn through their eyes, you know? See how they see everything and then I get it. You know, Sherry? I get it. Hey, ritchie rich, what's up? Hey, you know, same old, same old. Cool, cool. You know what the beauty of this school is, rich? I know you're going to tell me. Of course. It's, like, a cultural mecca. All races are represented. Yeah, I'm down with that. So who was guion bluford? You got me. First African-American astronaut. Do you know what year? Oh, I see. It's the double jeopardy round. 1969. Mm-mm. 1983. Sad, huh? That it took that long to get a brother into space. I'll give you double or nothing on this one. Maggie Walker. Who was she and what did she do? I'm drawing a blank here. First African-American female bank president, 1903. See, all they teach US nowadays, rich, is who was Malcom x, or Martin Luther King, or George Washington carver... And all very cool people, much respect goes out, but there's this whole other world out there, man, and it's yours. I know you're going to pass this test. Thanks, kiddo. All right. Get 'em, baby. Hi, Brady. Hey, been looking for you all over. There is a reporter from channel four on the phone. He wants to talk to you. Me? What for? Got a letter from one of the parents about your story. I...i don't know, lin, I'm not in this for the publicity. I know that, but you should talk to him. It will be good for you. Trust me. This is rich. Hey, rich, Lance filmore here. I was wondering if you'd like to do an interview with US for the 5:00 spot? How about you and I just sit down and talk? You know, this is, uh... This isn't really a good time. Can I get your number and call you back? Yeah, um... It's 997-2134. Okay, I got it. All right, I'll talk to you later. All right. Looking forward to it, rich. Rich donato, report to the art lab for a spill. All right, what's going on? It's not my birthday. Welcome to history class. I knew there wasn't no spill. Have a seat. What, you want me to paint my answers now? No, no, no, no. What do you see in front of you? Horses, soldiers... It's a war. Bravo. Now, can you tell me which war? All right, since there's no planes or tanks, I've got to go with the civil war. Give it up to the man. This is the Mexican-American war. In began in 1846 with a Mexican attack on the American troops on the south border of Texas on April 25th. The war ended on September 14, 1847, when u.S. General winfield Scott occupied Mexico City. Now, a few months later-- February 2, 1848, to be exact-- a peace treaty was signed. Now, this war was fought over land, of course-- land in which Mexico continued to claim despite the fact that Texas had claimed its independence 10 years earlier. A bogus landlord who still collects the rent even though he don't own the building. You got it? All right. Oh, and one more thing-- oh, no, no, come on, no more surprises, please. This isn't a surprise. It's a gift. For you, donato. Hey, big daddy, it's me, donato. Of course, you probably already knew that. So I got a lot on my plate right now, you know, and I could use a little room for dessert. I'm not asking for a miracle, because... You know, I already think I'm the luckiest guy around. I know you've got your hands full, and miracles, they... They don't really happen, you know? I'm aware of that. I just want to be able to hold my head up when I walk out of that test center on Saturday. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Okay. Thanks. Well, you know, the public support... I mean, this is just a great story, rich. Not really. You know how many kids drop out of school every day? No, you don't. You want to know why? Because the number is so high that, you know, people stopped counting a long time ago. My story isn't all that amazing, you know, or wonderful. I mean, it's kind of a bummer, Lance. I just... I slipped through the cracks. The only reason I'm agreeing to this interview is maybe one kid will see this and not do what I did. So you'll do the interview? Yeah. Yeah, okay, okay, we can do the interview. Rich donato is a janitor, a man who walks the hallways each day with a kind word for his students and a noisy walk unmistakably his. Now, four weeks ago, rich's life was turned upside down... Could you sit down? Now, it seems that rich doesn't have a high school diploma. Why is this important? It is mandatory that all public school employees possess one. I wasn't really looking for any of this to happen, Lance, you know? I mean, all this attention. Just, one thing led to another and it sort of snowballed, and here I am. I'm just trying to pass this test and, you know, keep my job. I look good on TV. The most unlikely tutors stepped up to the plate to give rich one more chance of passing. Jake? Jake? Here I come. We kind of owe it to him to make sure he passes the test. And so, um... Yeah, because, you know, losing him would be terrible. All right, thank you. Look at my hair. I never really realized how much rich mattered to the school-- and helping him has helped US. Yeah, and we won more than three games last year. A man who is adored by his students, respected by the faculty, and admired by the community. Tomorrow, when rich walks into that test center one last time, he can rest assured knowing that in his student's eyes, he's already made the grade. I'm Lance filmore, channel four news. All right, good luck, rich donato. Unbelievable. Go get 'em. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, all right. You guys didn't have to come out here, you know? I mean, no pressure... But, everybody... Thank you. Thanks. All right, showtime. All right, rock and roll. So it's do or die today, huh? Yep. Man, this is the last time that we are going to walk out of here. I can feel it, man, I can feel it. Okay. Time. Please put down your pencils and pass your test to the front of the room. There will be a one-hour recess. If you wish to have your results, please return by then. Otherwise, they will be mailed to you. Rich, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I just... I just don't want to go out there right now. Is it okay if I hang out here until you grade the tests? Sure, but it's going to take me a while. Oh, that's okay, I'll wait. But, listen, you know, do me a favor... When you come back, just hand me my test, okay? Very well. Thanks. Hey, the man of the hour. Rich, how'd you do, buddy? Where's Sherry, huh? I don't know. What'd you get, rich? I didn't look. I couldn't look. What did he get? Let's see. Well? What is it? An 80. 80 what? Just an 80. Aw, it can't be just an 80. It can't just be an 80. There's got to be a mistake. All right, hey. Hey, come on, you know, an 80 is awesome. All right, are you kidding me? I mean, that's like... That's like double the score that I got the last time that I took this thing, right? Okay, so thanks. Thank you. You...you're good, man. You did good. You did so good. All right. Hey, Linda, you know, thank you. Sorry. There's nothing to be sorry about, all right? Hey, hey. Being a champion is all well and good, but you can't eat a crown. Althea Gibson, 1968. Huh? Huh? Okay. All right, come on, come on, you guys. You know, it's not like you're never going to see me again, all right? I'll see you guys on Monday. All right, so we've got to go, okay? Okay, thanks for coming out, and, you know, thanks for the support, all right? This is Lance filmore, channel four news... Forget it, guys, cut it. Let's wrap it. Yeah! Baby! Are you okay? Yeah, I guess. You know, I'll tell you, Sherry. Failing that test wasn't the worst thing. It was looking into their eyes. I just wish I could see myself the way those kids see me, you know? Those kids, you know, they believed in me so much. They supported me, they carried me... And I just let them down. I just let them all down. Rich, come on. I mean, one point? I'm sure that doesn't matter. Hey, Jake-- no, let me finish, all right? I mean, if we call, like, the school board or something. Jake, I... Rich, this is bullshit, okay? Hey, that's going to cost you double, all right? Rules are rules, Jake, okay? You know, if they start making an exception for me, they've got to do it for everybody, then there's chaos and anarchy everywhere. You know, rioting in the streets, right? So what are you going to do now? I'll call around and try to find a job. You know, maybe my stepfather can hook you up. Rich, we're totally being screwed here. Jake, I told you, I tried to pass that test. Rich, it's not the test, okay? It's you. You are, like, the best thing that has ever happened in this school, you know? And they're just going to take that away from US? Rich, it's not right. You know, everywhere I go, every new school I go to, it's like, I get put into remedial. You know, and the kids ride me for it, and then my dad, he'll come in and he's, like, "Jake, we're moving again." But this time... No matter what the hell was going on here, you were there. You know, you were always there for me, and, you know, I just... And this place, I don't know what it's going to be like with you not here. It's...it's... Rich, you make this school a better place. All right, come here. Come here, all right? All right. Hey, whether I'm here or not, it don't matter, all right? You've got a friend for life, okay? And you kids make this a better place, not me. You kids are the ones that shine. Don't you ever forget that. Do you hear me? Don't you ever forget that. For god's sake, Freddie, it's fine where it is. Rich. I thought you had gone. I just... I've got a few more things. This is my nephew, Freddie. Oh, hey. Hey, you must be the new guy, huh? Yeah, I am. Okay. I was sorry to see you were unable to pass the test. I really was pulling for you. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Thanks. Thanks, skip. Yeah, I, uh... I really tried. Hey, you guys want to hear something? Oh, nah, forget about it. Please. "True genius comes from what's in your heart, "not from what a piece of paper hanging on a wall tells you. "It's what the people who love you the most tell you every day." That's my wife, Sherry. Okay. You know, I know you're really going to like this job, Freddie, okay? The kids, they're great. Do me a favor. You treat them right, okay? I know we're all having a hard time with rich being gone, but in light of that, rich would be very proud to know that this semester's highest test score belongs to... Jake matteson. If you maintain your current g.P.A., which I know you will, you will be able to move out of my class by the end of the year. Congratulations. Thanks. [ Telephone ringing ] Sherry, telephone. [ Telephone ringing ] Hello? Yeah, Mr. Donato? This is Bob arnoldson. I'm head of the school board for your district. After re-evaluating your case, it has come to our attention that you were misinformed. About what? Well, it seems you were never required to take the high school equivalency test. Seeing as how you've been with the district for 10 years, you're automatically grandfathered in. The clause does not affect you, only new applicants seeking employment. So, um...So what are you saying? That I've got my job back? That's, uh... That's exactly what I'm saying, Mr. Donato. I'm, uh... I'm very sorry for any inconvenience. Hey, no prob. I'm sorry I was listening, but who cares? That's fantastic. You got your job back, and you didn't even have to take that stupid test. Yeah, that's, uh... That's great, yeah. That's really great. Yeah. Yeah. Good morning. Good morning. How are you doing today? It's going to be a good day. Yes, it is. I know, I know, don't let you know what the results are. Mr. Lexington, I got my job back without having to pass this test, so it doesn't matter. I just wanted to walk into this room just to see if I could do it. Mm-hmm. So whatever I got this time, it's just for me. I can leave the results on the desk. Thanks for everything. It's been my pleasure. What am I? Nuts? Where you been? I had a little unfinished business to take care of. How'd we do? Our baby's father is the most recent high school graduate in the state.
