[waves splashing] [upbeat music] [low dramatic music] [screaming in distance] [tense dramatic music] [eerie music] [shouting] [roaring] [screaming] [man groaning] [tense rock music] - Hey, what I heard, this park is serious. - I heard he's an international spy. - It's very bad. - I wonder who's behind it. - [Man] I know, the whole world wants to know that, too. - Hey, you two, over there. - [Man] Yes, sir. [tense rock music] - [Man] Move on. You can't stand here. Hey, can't you hear what I'm saying? If you stay... If you stay I'll arrest ya! [sirens wailing] [tense rock music] - [Reporter] Hey, inspector! [reporters chattering] What's going on? [sirens wailing] - Right. [reporters chattering] [laughing] [shouting] [crowd shouting] [gunshot] [groans] [shouting] - Moon La Hoon, who had been charged with possession of arms last week, was knifed to death when he was escorted to the court hearing this morning. The assassin was a 25 year old Chinese male. He was shot instantly by the police. Several police were also injured. Now the police are investigating his background. Now over to international news. The Pentagon accused Vietnam of using Soviet supplied Agent Orange on Guerrillas in Campuchia. Meanwhile, the Task News Agency denounced the US for equipping NATO with chemical weapons. Both Washington and Moscow strongly deny these allegations. [lighthearted suspenseful music] [tense music] [grunting] [eerie suspenseful music] [air hissing] [eerie suspenseful music] - Who has a key to this door? - I broke it open. - Why's that? - This morning I saw blood seeping out and there was a strong smell so I broke it open and checked but then I found nothing. - Here, take this. Hey Carl, you've done very well. Keep this to yourself. - I know, Big Boss. [dramatic music] - This man, Yoo, know a lot. He's been killed right under your nose. You left us a dead end. Our political branch worked hard on this case, now you cops messed it up. - All right, we understand. Even popes and presidents get assassinated. So what's the big deal about this case? Do you remember the ammunition we found a few months ago? You light that up, it would blow up the whole city but we didn't make a fuss. - You both keep quiet. I'm in charge here. If you want to make a fuss here you can wait till I'm retired. This case is not simple. There must be a super power behind it. You mustn't act so rashly. Otherwise, there'll be more problems. [ethereal tense music] - [mumbles] are dead. My men killed Boo Li Ho in front of the court and you've taken care of the Cuban killer, too. How the will the feds retaliate? - Those two guys don't figure much. They're after your goods. - We'll get information from the Eagles tonight, then we'll know what the Bears are up to. - I'm sure they'll think of something. Stop the Eagles, I'll give them the goods to Campuchia. They want to get us. - They use rowboats, we use dollars. See what's better. I don't give a damn how much it costs. Hey, you had better be careful when you're in action. Don't be like that crazy man doing the job in public. Now that, he got himself killed. - He did it on purpose. He wanted to quit. I'm like him. We were in Vietnam. As ex-soldiers, we killed. We killed a lot. We killed in Vietnam and now in Hong Kong. - You must get rid of that watchman, Carl, for me. - Leave him. He is just a watchman. - You shouldn't say that. You know that if he ever let this thing get out into the open then both our heads would get chopped off. - But-- - We mustn't overlook any possibilities. Surely you killed civilians in Vietnam. - This is Hong Kong. - It's the same. This is a treacherous world. Little guys like the watchman always die first. You make it look like an accident. Now, if I can get you out of Saigon, I can get all of your family out as well but first you must earn their fare. [low tense music] [echoes of gunfire] [explosions] [gunfire] [bomb whistling in air] [dramatic tense music] - Lu Won. Lu Won! Lu Won. Lu Won! Lu Won! [phone ringing] Hello? - Andy, I'm Fanny. I've just finished. Let's go dancing tonight. - I'm busy. Get Kenny to go. - [Fanny] What's happened? - Don't ask. I got to go. [groaning] [upbeat dance music] [laughing] - [Woman] You're here, too. - [Man] You're a foreign movie star. - Come see me shooting when you're free. - [Man] That's good, I will. - Come to my house. - No, I want to stay here. - What about later? - Kenny, what are you staring at? Girls as usual? - Come on. - Let's go dancing. - There. [upbeat dance music] [low suspenseful music] [upbeat dance music] [low suspenseful music] [shouting] [eerie suspenseful music] [gunfire] [screaming] [baby crying] [eerie suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [upbeat dance music] - Hey, let's go dancing. - I didn't come here to dance. If you want fun, come with me. [soft suspenseful music] [soft suspenseful music] [doorbell ringing] Who's there? Who's there? [mock crying] [shouting] - Scared? - Of course I am. Never do that again. Crazy. - You're lucky, no work tonight. I've been working like a dog in the studio. That director's a real bastard. Hey, your wife, Fanny, kept me dancing all night. You've got to call her. - I'd have trouble if every girl I sleep with is my wife. Franny's crazy, ignore her. - Hey, do you know that crazy Moon we were with has become a killer? Now he's been killed. What's gonna happen to his grandma? Oh yeah, didn't you guys used to be good buddies? [reflective parlor music] - Who is it? - Granny, it's Andy. - Oh, Andy. Come, come in, come in. - Yeah, thanks. - Have some tea. - Thank you. - Not at all. Oh yes, Andy. My grandson, Han Moon, why doesn't he come to see me? - Han Moon's very busy. He's been sent to Thailand. Here's some money. He told me to give it to you and some minced buns that you like. Come, eat while it's hot. - Thanks a lot. Andy, since Han Moon went to Thailand, has he written to you? - Yes, yes. - What did he say in the letter? Did you bring it? - I'll read it to you. "Andy, how are you? I'm very well here. You must go and see Granny. Buy her minced buns. I'll come back soon. Tell my granny better quit gambling." [somber flute music] - Andy, all these years in Vietnam I only wanted a family to live happily with you and for you to have a career but now you're going to Hong Kong alone and let your mother down. - Take this with you. [sobbing] - [Man] Come on. We can't wait all day. Come on, move it. [sobbing] [men shouting] - I'll get you all to Hong Kong! [tense rock music] - Why are you so worried? - You mean the Eagles didn't tell you? - You can stop beating about the bush. Come on, out with it. - I came here especially to warn you. I've got news that the Bears are after us now. - I'll handle them. Don't you worry. - The rubles are money, too. Those men are not simple. You'd better send more men to help me. - Ammunition during the Korean War and heroin during the riots, refuges during the Vietnam War. - Money, not man enough. - With money there's never enough. But how much more can we make out of Hong Kong? I want to get away from Hong Kong for awhile. You have a man called Andy. Tonight, you'll get a message from the Eagles, then tell Andy to proceed, get rid of the Bears. - Master, breakfast ready. - Coming. - Oh, master. The young lady just called to say she's working tonight. Won't be back for dinner. - Song Yang, you shouldn't come here again. Call me if there's anything. - Vietcong agents, Phan Man Bil, rank Lieutenant, Yun See Hung, rank Lieutenant Colonel. Lu Quon Path, rank Colonel. Exterminate them. [tense rock music] - Phan Man Bil! [gunshot] [shouting] [screaming] - [Man] Get out of here. [upbeat funky music] [upbeat funky music] [low suspenseful music] [gunshot] [eerie string music] [knocking] [soft rock music] [eerie tense music] [grunting] [dramatic suspenseful music] [dramatic sting] - Hello, police. This is Fuji Hotel. [tires screeching] - Calling head office. - Go ahead. - This is Vicky. I'm not on location, over. - [Dispatch] What's it like? Need any help from head office? [sighs] Hey, how is everything, over? - Not, too good. The lady's walked off sulking, over. - [Dispatch] Sulking, why? Over. - You idiot, you asked if she needed help, meaning she can't cope. - You get up there. We'll stop the reporters. [overlapping shouting] - We don't know. You've got to ask... - Have you got any information yet? - Hey, we just got here ourselves. We don't know anything. [overlapping shouting] You've got to ask Public Relations. [overlapping shouting] - Hey get back. Hold it, hold it. Come on, make way. - Quiet, quiet, please. - Give us some information. Anything you've got. What's this about a heart attack? - About half an hour ago our room boy here, discovered a dead man in a room. So he called the police. - What was the cause of death? - Oh, we have to wait for an autopsy. - So this is connected with the recent killings? - We're investigating. [overlapping shouting] Thank you, thank you. Excuse me. [overlapping shouting] - Come on. Hold it, now make way. Make way. [overlapping shouting] [dramatic music] - At three PM this afternoon, the body of a man was discovered by a room boy on the sixth floor of the Fuji Hotel. The police are... Hey, Op Hang, come. Hey, inspector. Are politics involved in this hotel murder? Inspector, you're from the political branch, why have you come here? Who's the dead man? Hey, you're briefcase opened. - He's from the special branch. - Hmm, let's go. - Hmm. [men mumbling] [lighthearted suspenseful music] - Hey. - Bye bye. Hey, big case? - I'm dog tired. So many sudden cases. - What's new? - One murder after another. Makes me sick. - [Woman Voiceover] Brother, we've received your parcel. Mom is very happy. We all miss you. [phone ringing] - Hello? Oh, hold on, please. Vicky, telephone. - Oh. Thank you. Hello, daddy? Dinner? I can't, I'm busy. Aren't you going to Thailand? When do you leave? Oh. All right. Bye bye. - Hey, here's the film. - [Woman Voiceover] The government has introduced new economic policies. Most Chinese business closed down. Father's changed to dealing gold on the black market. Our house has been searched many times. - Why so late? - I'm busy. - [Woman Voiceover] Father's health is deteriorating. Mother's very worried. We want to join you in Hong Kong but each passage costs 30 tails of gold. When will we see you again? - Good evening, here's the evening news. A murder was discovered at three PM this afternoon. The victim was a Vietnamese male, around 30 years old. He was found in his room at the Fuji Hotel, lying in a pool of blood. He was certified dead there. The case has been classified as homicide. This brings the number of murders to three so far this week. The police have set up a special unit on this case. Including inspectors from the special branch. Now, to international news. There's been more trouble in Iran, fighting has broken out again. [soft tense music] [siren wailing] [coughing] Can you tell us about the gas? - A bad smell, I've never come across it. - What are the effects on the students? - Nausea, dizziness. - And on yourself? - I felt nauseous, too. - [Vicky] How did this come about. - [Teacher] We were having a class. It happened all of a sudden. - [Vicky] But do you know where this gas has come from? - [Teacher] I have no idea. - How many students need hospitalization? - Everyone in primary five. [soft tense music] - Earlier this morning at about nine AM, the Lutheran Primary School was attacked by a mysterious gas. Students in class Five A were all overcome by nausea and complained of dizziness. All the students are now hospitalized. This is the third mysterious gas incident so far this month. The government hasn't located the source of the gas. This is Vicky Lee for ATV reporting at the scene. Why hasn't the government come up with any answers? - We're working very hard on it. The Medical and Health Department believes that the cause isn't toxic gas. Our investigations reveal that the level of air pollution in the school area is acceptable to us. - You mean acceptable or you mean tolerable? [laughs] - Of course acceptable. We believe this group sickness to be a psychological symptom. This means it became contagious among the students, so that's why so many students were sent to hospital. - Could it be caused by the pressure of too much schoolwork? - We've already passed the matter to the Education Department to investigate. - So the gas incident that came to the school yesterday was purely psychological? - Regarding that incident. Our investigation show, as there's a garbage dump in a nearby street and the rubbish was not collected there for over a week. The stench could have drifted to the school on the wind and so caused this incident to happen when it did. - Or could it be caused by the exhaust from nearby factories? - Is that possible? - Of course it's possible. - Well, this is possible but we feel highly unlikely because our investigation show that the level of air pollution, from the factories, is tolerable. - But you just earlier that it was acceptable. [laughing] - I mean it's tolerable. Well if there's no more questions now then, that's it, okay? [reporters grumbling] [tense dramatic music] - This mans Kim Ji Yung, an ex Vietnamese soldier. He became a spy after the war, a hitman for the Bears. - What do you think? - Oh, we've got news that he's here in Hong Kong and he's here especially to take care of that Eagles gang. We must pick him up. - Hey, take it easy. Let them fight among themselves. We'll turn a blind eye. - Hey what? - Inspector Lau is right. This case is very sticky, so don't make any move, unless we're sure of it. [eerie music] [gunshot] [tense electronic music] - Don't move or I'll shoot. [gunshot] [groaning] [eerie tense music] [gunfire] - Fire! [eerie tense music] Fire, that's an order! [gunfire] [shouting] [baby crying] [tense dramatic music] - Check the time. You've got one minute. - Andy what are you-- - Shut up! Tell me, Kim Ti Yung's here to kill me. You know about it. Don't lie to me! Crazy Moon is dead. You're the only one that knows about me. - The Bears sent him. - Someone, someone's betrayed me. - Andy, I know nothing about this but I can find out. - 30 seconds. - If I wanted you dead, I would do it myself. As you trust me, you'd be off your guard, right? In any case, why would I want to sell you out? Don't worry, leave this to me. - Hello, Rao Observatory? I'm ATV Reporter Vicky Lee, could you please give me yesterday's wind direction and speed? What's it? Oh, one six right. Thank you. Pause it. - Fine, we'll take a look. - Let's start. - [Man] Not a bad shot, huh? - Rubbish. Hey, stop, there. Look at that flag. - Yeah, so what? - Now the school is here, the flag is blowing that way. I checked with the Rao Observatory. The wind yesterday was from the west. The smell of the garbage was blowing away from the school. Got it? - Oh, you're right. [tense dramatic music] - But I explained to you clearly on the phone, the lab reports on the gas incidents are confidential. It's government data. I can't tell you anything. - Uncle Wu, for the good of the people, please show me. - I work for the government. What's good for the people isn't always good for the government. Although, you're my niece, I still can't disclose this. I'll be jailed for it. - Uncle Wu, you're always good to me. Please do it for me. - There's no way. Don't waste my time. I haven't even eaten yet. Now, I'm gonna buy a lunch box. Keep an eye on these files for me. Don't touch them or I'll be in trouble. - I know. - I'll be back in 10 minutes. - Thank you. [upbeat orchestral music] [indistinct radio chatter] [sighs] Sarin, a kind of highly toxic nerve chemical, deadly, poisonous, capable of rapidly destroying the nervous system. Soman, also a toxic nerve chemical, deadly, poisonous. Very similar to Sarin but of greater toxicity. [upbeat funky music] - No import of these two chemicals in the past two years. - Before that? - Yeah, several years back. They're the importers. - Can I copy the names? - Sure. [upbeat funky music] - Yeah, here's the address of the importers. - Thank you. Now, look at the map and check the addresses. Any of these importers in this area could of caused the gas accident. We'll check them early tomorrow. [upbeat funky music] Look at you. Stop smoking now. Terrible. - You're right. So dirty. - Let's look here. Come on, stop eating. [muffled mumbling] [yawning] Hey. Hurry, let's go to that one. - Hey, miss. We've checked over 10 places. It's time to go home. This place is so clean, I'm sure it's all right. - Just don't let their looks deceive you. - A woman's sixth sense. - You're wrong. Not sixth sense, it's news sense. - I don't have your news sense. You go yourself then. I need some rest then. Goodbye. - Who'd you want, miss? - I want to see your manager. - Hey, hey. - Hey, you. - Hey! - What's going on here? - Come on. - Can't you see that this is private-- - Give me back my camera. - What are you doing in here? - Come on, let go of me. - Taking pictures? - Come on, let go. - Come with me. - Let go. - What is this? - I'm a reporter from ATV. - Oh, it's you. - Uncle Tong? - Give her the camera. - Uncle, I have some questions. - All right. Hey, back to work. Oh yes, how's your dad? - I've lived alone since I've came back from the states. We've both been busy. I only see him once a month. Oh yeah, but you always see him at the previews. - Oh yeah. Actually, we were going to Thailand but then I've been busy. He went. I think this time he'll stay there for some time. So you wanted to talk? Come to my office. - All right. Uncle Tong, has your factory ever imported these two chemicals? - No. - You sure you haven't? - This is a commercial secret. Since your dad and I are good friends, so I'll tell you the truth. No. Now then, these chemicals, what are they for? - I don't know. There was a gas accident at a school around here recently. The students were hospitalized and lab reports show they inhaled these chemicals. - Now, my factory is a film lab. We've no need for these chemicals. - In the past? - Never. - All right, I've got to go. - Right. [soft reflective music] [phone ringing] - Hello? - Hello, Pang? Listen, tomorrow morning get two empty chemical drums and make them look like the containers for the two chemicals. - Oh, miss, do you know what time it is? - It's two. - Thanks a lot. - You listen, now you have another two hours of sleep. Have everything ready by seven. [upbeat funky music] If you've never imported these chemicals then tell me, where did these photos come from? I checked with the trade department, your factory has imported these chemicals before. - That's right, now I remember. We did import them a long time ago. But not for our own use. They were for re-export. - Re-export, where to? [laughs] - My dear girl, you shouldn't ask so many questions. You think I'm manufacturing toxic gas which sends students to the hospital? [chuckling] Come with me. - Where to? - To the film studio. Have to keep an eye on those directors, make sure they don't waste my money. Come. [upbeat funky music] - Move that camera over here. - Mix it well. [distant chatting] - Remember, push in your hand if it doesn't work. - All right, I hope it works. [gunshots] [lighthearted music] [gunshot] [shouting] [overlapping chatting] [laughing] - [Man] The waters... - Let me introduce you. This is ATV reporter, Miss Vicky Lee, you should know her. This is our explosive expert, Andy. The best we have. - Hi. - Hi. - Haven't we met before? - That so? I see you on TV all the time. - Vicky, I'll show you around. - Okay. [soft tense horn music] - I'll take you to see your favorite star. She's shooting over there. - Bye bye. - Bye. [tires screeching] Hey, watch it. Be careful, driver. - No cab at this hour. You want a lift? What is it? You don't know me? - Oh, sure I do. - Then hop on. - Thank you, I'll wait. - I wasn't passing. I came to pick you up. I want to find out how much you know about Tong Yin. See, I work for him. He asked me to check you out. [soft piano music] Come. [engine revving] [reflective piano music] Sit down. - So, Tong Yin sent you to find out how much I know about him. So go on. Now don't try and play games with me. Why don't you ask? So you think you're smart. - So aggressive. No wonder Tong Yin is so afraid of you. You've got him worried now. - What's he afraid I'll find out? - What are your hobbies? - Tong Yin doesn't pay you to ask those questions. - I do things in my own way. Tong Yin wants to know about you, not me. So I'm not hungry. The same with you. You want to know about Tong Yin, so you are hungry. [soft reflective music] Have more. Like it? - Not bad at all. So now will you tell me about Tong Yin then? - Don't worry. You don't have to sleep with me in return. [scoffs] What do you know about Tong Yin? - I know enough. - You want to know more? - Of course. [chuckles] - It proves that you don't know anything at all. - You're smart. Thanks for dinner. - Hey! Hey, hey. You're so touchy. How can you be a reporter? Even though we just met, can we be friends? No harm in that right, okay? - I hope not. - Hey! I'm going to the refugee camp tomorrow. I think you'd like to come, too. Huh? [upbeat romantic music] [singing in foreign language] - My parents were divorced many years ago. My brothers worked themselves in the states. After studying journalism, I came back here to work. I hardly know my father. When I was in school, I saw many anti Vietnam War demonstrations. Do you miss your country? - Yeah. To me Vietnam is like a nightmare. For me, the war isn't over. Deaths, killings, muggings. I'm numbed by all this. My only dream is to, to get my family here to Hong Kong. [soft tense romantic music] [soft somber music] [eerie tense music] [panting] [shouting] [screaming] - [Man] Surrender, surrender. Drop your arms. Surrender. [shouting] Give up your arms. Give up your arms. Surrender. Surrender, the People's Government is kind to war prisoners. [eerie tense music] [panting] [soft somber music] [soft somber music] [groaning] [men grumbling] - [Man] Is he all right? Hey, are you okay? - I'm all right. - You all right? You all right? - Yeah, he's okay. Okay, someone look after the car. - Thanks, you guys. - [Man] Okay that's a wrap, that's a wrap. - Andy, some water? - [Man] Someone gonna get the car? What's the next shot then? We need some lights. - Are you all right? Are you tired? Go and have a rest. I told you to quit, it's too dangerous but you don't listen and the pay's bad. [shushes] - Shut up. - What's wrong with you? You're always like this when I talk to you these days. What's happened? You changed a lot. You weren't like this before. - Why don't you shut up? - I know, Andy. You must have found another girl. - Jesus, aint you through, yet? - Tell me what's up. I want to settle this right now. - Fanny, leave off. Stop quarreling. - It's not your business. Now if you don't explain things right now then we're through. Tell me now, come on. [shouts] - You're asking for it. [sobbing] - Get going. [soft tense music] [laughing] [screaming] [laughing] - Stop, stop. Stop it. [eerie electronic music] - Andy. Listen. Your girl, Fanny's being raped by my men. Be there, you don't want to miss the show. [dramatic somber music] - Are you crazy? Fanny was so good to you. How can you do this to her? - I've got no choice. - Why don't you call the police? - I can't do that. - Why can't you? - Forget it. - But why? - If I do, I'll be dead. - Rubbish. [grunting] [water splashing] - Listen. I swear I will cut the murderer to pieces. - Hey, Kim, you think Andy will come? [tense drum music] - Hold it. Don't shoot. Shoot! [gunshot] [gunshots] [grunts] [gasping] [explosion] [dramatic music] [people moaning] [screaming] - What are you doing? - Bastard. Keep quiet. Or I'll castrate you. [soft dramatic music] - Hello? Is that Ms. Lee? - Speaking. - I'm Andy's friend, Kenny. Well now, I don't know how to tell you. Andy's just received news from Vietnam that his father, mother, sister, were all killed while trying to get out of the country and he seems to have gone crazy about it. He won't eat or sleep. Can you come and see him? - Right, I'll come now. [soft somber reflective music] Andy. [gasping] [sobbing] - I'll get you to Hong Kong! I came here alone. All these years I've risked my life for money hoping to get my family here. [somber reflective music] These last years, so many people have lost their families and nobody cares about it. There are thousands of them. They're all Chinese. Do you understand, you understand? Let me tell you. Tong Yin's factory is manufacturing toxic gas. [tense music] The same gas used in the Korean Vietnam Wars known as TX-24. He's making it for the Eagles. For the use in Campuchia against the Bears. Agent Orange. - You got any proof? - It's at Tong Yin's factory. - If we nail him, will you be involved? - It's all right. I only care for you. [tense dramatic music] - Now, check every film if you like. So what now, my dear girl? So this is your exclusive story, is that right? - You got anything to say? A false charge. Now you've embarrassed the news department. This your fault. Why are you so stupid? How can you let her do this? From now on, you're responsible for her, got it? Back to work. [dramatic suspenseful music] - It's close. If I hadn't found out in time, the special branch would have gotten to us by now. - Well what's the reason you asked me here? - That reporter, Vicky Lee, she knows too much. You know what to do. - I know what you mean. But I can't do it. - Look, this is an order, not a suggestion. - She's a well known reporter. If she gets killed, they'll be a scandal. I've been through a lot to get out of Vietnam. I've lost my country, my family. I'm tired of killing. I can't do it anymore. I'm tired. I'm tired of it. - But this is business. You have to think of the whole organization. You can't refuse to do it. That damn bitch won't leave us alone. We must get rid of her. - But still, I don't want to do it. - Listen to me, you know that once a killer always a killer. [dramatic music] Think about it. [kid humming] [energetic dramatic music] - You want me to stop? No way. - And why can't you? - Why'd you want me to stop? This is toxic gas, it's serious and you're from Vietnam, you should know much better. - But the whole world is like this. What can you do? - It's the principle. These lethal weapons, they shouldn't be in Hong Kong. - And how much can you do? - I don't give a damn, I can't stop now. [phone ringing] Hello? What? My father? How come? Where is it? [dramatic tense music] [sobbing] - What is it? What's happened? [sobbing] - My fathers dead. His body was found at Chon's Bay. [sobbing] - What was your father's name? - Lee Hong Fat. [sobbing] [gunshot] [sobbing] - Get the car over here, eh. Two cameras, the same time. Ready? - [Man] Right. - Hey, take this away. - Yeah. - [Man] Okay yeah. Get that ladder out of here. Stand by. - Camera! Cut. Cut it. Hey, what's the matter, what's wrong? Why jump out so quick? The car wasn't even there. Now wait for the car to arrive, you understand? - [Man] Okay. Yeah, you ready? Get into position. [soft tense music] - Standby. Well, you ready? Okay. [gunfire] [soft dramatic music] [explosion] [eerie tense music] - Hey, how is Andy now? Well just how did it happen? Tell me. - I, I don't know. Hey. Doctor! - Doctor. - Doctor, how is Andy now? - Don't worry, don't worry. He'll be fine. He suffered superficial burns. He's okay. Because of his military training, he managed to protect himself. He'll recover soon. Don't worry. - [Kenny] He's okay, he's okay. - How did this happen? - Someone trapped me. - I'll find out who did it. - How do you feel now? - What'd the doctor say? - He said that you'll recover soon. You'll be okay. - Hey, you two haven't talked. I'm going. [laughing] Huh? [laughing] [shouting] Get Andy out of here! Take him away, quick. Get him out. [grunting] [tense music] Go! [eerie tense music] [grunting] [eerie tense music] [screaming] [groaning] [soft reflective music] - You want more? - No. - Tell me, why's everyone after you? - I've killed many people. - But that was in the war. It's different now. - For some, the war never ends. - Do you know Andy's on his feet again? Not a scratch on his face. You've the gall to ask me for money. - Hey boss, I didn't know that. Maybe the explosives were damp in the studio after so long. Although he's alive, he was hurt quite badly. Remember, boss, I put my life on the line. If somebody finds out. We're both in trouble. I'm broke now. Please help me, boss. Okay? - Right. Okay. The last time. Eh? [eerie tense music] - Andy? Have some tea. - Thanks. [soft romantic music] - After you've fully recovered, I'll take my vacation and we'll leave here and go somewhere. Mountain climbing, swimming, skiing. I'll cook you my best meal. [laughs] - Vicky. I'm going out for awhile. - You'll be all right? - Don't worry. I'll be fine. [tense dramatic music] [engine revving] [soft footsteps] [soft footsteps] - It's been awhile. How have you been? - Resting. - Better now? So now, why do you want me to come here. - It's regarding Vicky, can you leave her alone? - So you've been with her all this time? - That's right. - Why didn't you kill her? Eh? To a man like you, killing is a cinch. So why? - But not killing someone that I like. [tense music] - [Tang] Good, she's here. - Tang Yin, what do you want? - You stay away. - Even if you shoot I'll kill you just the same. You try me. - Andy, don't let a woman come between us. It's no use. Sooner or later she'll find out you killed her father. - Is what he says true? Is it true? Tell me, tell me! It's true? - Yes. But I didn't know that he was your father. - I don't believe it. How could you? [sobbing] - Vicky!

I, I don't have to kill anymore. [sobbing] [somber reflective music] - [Granny] Who is there? - I'm Andy's friend. - Come in, please. - Granny. - Huh? - This money, it's your grandson. He asked Andy to deliver it. - Thanks a lot. Oh yes, my grandson, when's he coming back? - I don't know. - Where's Andy, why doesn't he come? [soft reflective music] - He won't come anymore.
