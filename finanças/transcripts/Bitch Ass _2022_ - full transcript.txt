(spooky piano music) Good evening. Welcome to the gamble. I'm sure you're all familiar with the hood horror stories of old, Blacula, Bones, People Under the Stairs, Tales From the Hood, and (laughs) Candy Man. But I'm willing to bet that you've never heard of this particular story before. This is the tell of the first black serial killer to ever don a mask. His name is Bitch Ass. This is a story of revenge. A story of nightmarish tales in which the stakes are no less than your very lives. Are you willing to play? (laughs) Good, good. Let the story begin. (laughs) (thunder crashes) (eerie piano music) (television clicks) (static crackles) (eerie suspenseful music) (sirens wailing) (woman breathing heavily) (footsteps thumping) (dog barking) (eerie suspenseful music) Why you running? (woman screams) Do you know who I am? Give me what's in your bag. - No! I said give me what's in your bag and you can go. No. - Bitch, you know who I am? - I don't care. I'm X, with the sixth street gang. I don't care. Girl, you need to learn some fucking manners. (woman spits) Bitch, you know who I am! (girl screams) (punch thuds) Hey, you ain't gonna hit me like no bitch, man. (punch thuds) Yo, you just knocked my fucking tooth out. (punch thuds) (X groans) Ouch, mother fucker, get off. Get off of me! You know who I'm with? Sixth street gang, mother fucker. Get off me, get off me. (screams) (door thuds) (scary dramatic music) (high intensity techno music) (Q breathing heavily) (puzzle cube clicking) You're late Q. Sorry. You're sorry. Can anyone tell me what the deadliest animal in Africa is? Lion Tiger Elephant No. What about you, Q? It's the hippo. It's the hippo. (laughs) (claps) That is correct. Can anybody tell me why? It is because mother fuckers underestimate, the hippo. You see, all they see is some cute cuddly fat ass water cow. And they get up and they get too close. (fist slams on table) (laughs) You're fucking dead. (heart pumping) Is that what you're doing? Underestimating me. No. That's good, because underestimating me can be just as fucking deadly. (intense eerie music) Damn tonight, is y'all's six, six, six night. 20 years ago today, it was my initiation. So, as a little anniversary celebration, I got a special task for the group. A rich old bitch down the street done finally kicked the bucket. The wicked bitch is dead. Back in my day, rumor had it, she had money and all types of rich lady shit stashed away in the house. So, you are gonna break in and rob the place. What, Moo? If there's money in there, how come you never got it before? Put your hand down. Robbing old people is fucked up. Do you think I'm a monster? Um no, naw. But what about her grandson? Doesn't he still live there? [Moo] I heard that guy worships the devil. Sacrifices animals and shit like this. Nah, man, he kidnaps people and eats them. On some cannibal shit. Little Bobby, Fat Kevin, Cross eyed Keisha and Lil' Vernon. And what about X? He's been missing for a week and last anybody's saw him was over by that house. Hey, hey, hey, stop this bull shit. I grew up with that fat fuck. Trust me, when I tell you, he's a bitch. I ain't afraid of him. Shit, I know you ain't, nephew. We gonna go in that house. And we gonna handle that shit. Good, and when y'all done, come back here and I will give you your first cut. And then, you will officially be members of sixth street. (laughs) All right, y'all get the fuck out of here. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up, Q. Hey look, man, all this running late shit. That's got to stop. Yeah. I'm sorry, Spade. I had school. You had school? Hey, is school putting money in your pocket? (suspenseful music) Goddamn, I'm trying to help you, man, but you're not making that easy. You and your moms, y'all struggling, right? Damn man, she's working two jobs? You want to help her? Man, you get serious about this crew, you could put some real money in her pocket. Go ahead. Yeah, okay, I got it. All right. Don't come back till it's done. Hey, it has been a minute since X came around. You know anything? Naw, nothing yet. But X, that kid's stupid. I figured he just got picked up snatching purses again. Damn, I told him to stop doing that petty shit. All right, if you hear something, you let me know. I got you. (apprehensive rap music) [Tuck] Shit, I don't know about y'all. I can't wait to go to the beach. Catch some sunsets and shit, ball out. [Cricket] Nigga, sunsets? [Tuck] Yeah, so what. [Cricket] Man with my cut. I'm trying to marry my girl. So, if y'all find an engagement ring in there, give it here. Ya feel me? (backpack thuds) - Shit, oh, fuck. Hey man, why is Q Ball coming tonight? Yeah man, he's whack. Punk's just gonna slow us down. He's fine. He with me. Y'all need to worry about y'all selves. You ready? Bro, I don't know, man. What you mean, you don't know? Haven't I always looked out for you? Yeah. Made sure nobody messing with you. Yeah. And when we got caught shoplifting, who took the blame for that? You did. That's right? Cause you like a brother to me, man. Now I need you to have my back. Wait, why the locks on the outside of the house? Old lady had dementia and would wonder the streets in the middle of the night. Yo, I think I see something in the window. You think that's him? (pager beeps) - Ah! Oh shit! Relax man. It's just my pager. Oh, shit, it's my mom. Hey yo, look, I gotta go. She's gonna flip out. I think your momma fine as hell. Shit, me too, actually. Thanks. I guess. (creepy keyboard music) - All right, I'm out. Yo Q, make sure you be here at midnight. 20 he don't show. 40. Don't worry. He'll be here. (eerie screechy music) (gate squeaks) (eerie somber music) (door creeks) (door clicks) Mom? Mom, I thought you quit. I thought you were supposed to be home on time. Mom. Don't, mom, me. I want you to explain to me why I have to page you to come home. On 6, 6, 6 night, no less. You know how dangerous that is? Sorry, I stopped by a friend's house and I lost track of time. Whose? Tucks? No, it was. Quentin. We're gonna pick this conversation up later. Right now, you have company. Ms. Jacobs. Quentin, hey, yeah I wanted to come by and talk to you. This is delicious, Miss Gatson. - Oh, call me Marsia. - Mm Is this about the scholarship? Yes. So I got it? No. But, you said I was a shoe-in. I know, but truth is I say that to everyone. Excuse me? I got to tell them something to get them to apply. You understand? But, there's gotta be more that I can apply for. Let's face it. Your grades are good, but not great. It's not like you're trying to be a doctor. I am trying to be a doctor. Oh. I think it's time you leave. Before I go, where can I get the recipe for this? I bought it at the store. Ooh, I got to go to that store. (laughs) (eerie humming music) (dishes clanking) Man, why do I gotta do dishes? I didn't even eat. I don't recall that being a requirement. Maybe now you can tell me why you came in my house late. We talked about this Q. I do not want you hanging out with Spade and those sixth street ass-holes. Spade's not a bad guy. He's just looking out for me. Okay, that's the way it seems. But Spade is always looking out for himself. No, he's just I grew up with people like Spade. You are not like them. You are going to college. Come on mom, you heard Ms. Jacobs. Okay, Q. I'm sorry about the scholarship baby, but I don't give a damn what she said. Maybe I could just get a job and you know, earn some money and I'll do college later. No, Quentin, because later becomes never. I will figure out a way to pay for college. I don't care if I have to work a third and a fourth job. I'll take care of it. Thanks mom. I love you. I love you too. Does this mean I don't have to put away any dishes? (both laugh) I'll tell you what. I'll play you for it. - Okay. - Okay. All right, let's go. - 1, 2, 3, shoot. - 1, 2, 3, shoot. I got you. Yeah, you know I let you win, right? - No you didn't. - You didn't win. (eerie humming music) (jar clanks) (jar thuds) Oh shit. (spooky tech music) I knew your boy was gonna bitch out. Shit, more money for us. Shut up, he'll be here. We good? Yeah, yeah, I'm just saying. We ain't got all night. You know? You late. My bad. You good? Yeah, I'm good. If all the windows and doors are locked, how are we gonna get in? Don't trip. I can pick locks. No, you can't, fucking liar. Of course I can. I learned it from mom. Right there. There's your locked door. Show me. No, wait a minute, okay, maybe we should just - I got you. I got you. I got you. He can pick locks? Hell no, he can't. His uncle's in jail. [Moo] Shit, ouch. Ouch, shit. (Cricket, Q and Tuck sigh) Couldn't pick it. Stupid ass. Let's go around the back. (eerie suspenseful music) What's up? What do you thinks in there? Who cares? It's the Gushinson house. [Cricket] Hey yo, I think I found a way in. [Tuck] Come on. (door squeaks) Moo, go in there. Man, what if they got raccoons in there man. I don't want rabies. 90% of raccoons got rabies. That's a fact. Move. I'll do it. (tense suspenseful music) [Grandma] What is your new game called again? It's called Shopopoly. It's life Monopoly. But instead of hotels you buy snacks. Leave it to you to invent a game where you get to buy snacks. (Cecil & Grandma laugh) Good old snacks. (dice clanking) (game piece tapping) Where did you get this piece? The museum room. Grandma, you're hurting me. That belonged to your Grandpa. You aren't supposed to touch them. I'm sorry, Grandma. You disobeyed me, Cecil. No, I said, I said, I'm sorry. Pain is penance, and penance (lighter clicks) Is a gift to God. No, no! (screams) (flame sizzling) (intense spooky music) Damn, look at all the board games. This some hoarder shit. [Tuck] Nah, this shit is fucked is up. [Moo] Woo. You found something? Yeah. What? Mouse trap. So. So we could play it after. You too stupid to play the game. (tense dramatic music) Yo, you find a way out here? [Q] I think so. There's some stairs up here. [Tuck] Watch your ass. If you knock anything down, they're gonna know we down here. (cards thumping) (spooky suspenseful music) Jesus Christ. Man, I told y'all this place was creepy. I bet you they got some nice plasmas around here. We ain't here for the TV man. [Q] So what's the plan? Cricket, you stay here on the first floor. Me and Q gonna go to the second floor. And Moo, you go to the basement. Why the fuck I gotta go to the basement and you get to go upstairs? Cause I'm the one that got this. What the fuck is that? If his bitch ass wakes up, I'm gonna make sure he go back down. Naw, naw I'm out. You can't leave, uh uh, we in this now. Gotcha. (laughs) It ain't even loaded. Don't play like that. Relax, man. We just having a little fun. All right. Split up. Let's get this shit done. (stair creaking) (eerie somber music) Hey, you go in there. Come get me if you anything. [Moo] Hey Moo, why don't you go down to the basement? Why don't you go down to the basement, bitch. Damn, I should have said that. (light clicks) Yo. (plastic crinkling) What the fuck? Huh, this is one creepy mother fucker here. (light thuds) Tuck? Cricket is that you? If that's you, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you. (scary dramatic music) Yo, who's there? (Moo screams) (door creaks) (door clicks) (door creaks) (door clicks) I get it. Y'all like Jesus. Thou shall not disobey. Thou shall not swear. Thou shall not drink. - [Grandma] The most important Thou shall not do drugs. [Grandma] Thou shall not lust. [Cecil] She's just my friend. That little trollop means to corrupt you, Cecil. Tempt you, and I won't allow it. No, she's an angel. Hand me the switch. Grandma. The switch. I, I won't talk to her anymore. I wish I could believe that, Cecil. I really do. Hand it to me. Now, take off your shirt. (music intensifies) (stick thumps) This is for your own good. (stick thumps) Ahh! (stick thumps) (Grandma grunts) Ahh! This whole family is crazy. (suspenseful music) Whoa. A black cat? What they want bad luck? A dinosaur. How the fuck they get that up in here? This shit is wild. Come on lady, where'd you put all the good stuff? All right. (paper rustling) [Moo] Yo, help! Help!

(lever creaks) Do you like games? [Moo] Just let me go. I call this surgeon. (electricity crackling) Remove the body parts with the tongs. Fuck you. Grandma didn't like cursing. You will get a chance to play me for your life. First, with three misses, dies. No you fucking retard. (bones cracking) Ahh! I said no cursing. All right. I should go first. (Moo coughs) - Mm mm.

Hey Cecil, hey. Forget those guys. Don't let them bother you. They're idiots. (puzzle cube clicks) What's that? It's a puzzle cube. You like games, huh? Yeah, I do. I play them all the time with my grandmother. So how many games you got? 300. Maybe more. Damn, that's a lot of games. I, I built a game house in my backyard. I make my own games back there and that's what I want to go to college for. That's cool. (gentle romantic music) Would you like to come over and play sometime? Yeah. Why not? Boo. Jesus. That's not funny Spade. Well, if it isn't the spoiled rich boy from down the street. It's it's not like that. Oh, I don't know, Bitch Ass. You live in a big house and your grandma drives a caddy. Seem pretty fucking rich to me. So what's going on here, Marsia? Nothing, Cecil and I were just talking about college. You hear that, Boots? He plans on leaving us all behind. Yo, maybe he thinking about taking my girl with him. - Spade it's not like that. - Let him answer. Is that what you're thinking? No, I was asking her if she wanted to come over and play sometime. You know she would never go out with you, right? Please stop. Nah, this nigga need to hear the truth. She wouldn't fuck you if you had a $20 bill hanging out your zipper. Lincoln couldn't get your fat ass laid. Abraham Lincoln is on the five actually. You like school? Well, I'm about to teach you a lesson. Every action has consequences. (puzzle cube clicking) Grandma says, thou shall not steal. What? Give it back. Oh shit. Yo, fuck him up. - Yo, you gonna die you fat fuck.

No! Please, stop. (panic hollering) (body thuds) (Q gasping and moaning) (plastic crinkles) (music abruptly stops) (bell gongs) (beads rattle) - [Marsia] Where is Spade? Hey, I told her not to come in here. It's all good. Look who it is. How can I help you? Cut the shit, Spade. Where the fuck is my son? You have a child? You know who he is. Yeah, I do know who he is. It's too bad. He is in the middle of 6, 6, 6 night right now. My god, goddammit. I told you to stay the fuck away from him. Hey, hey, it is not my fault, your son doesn't stay away from me. He probably needs a father figure in his life. Who is his daddy, anyway? Not you. I bet his daddy's a bum. (Boots laughs) I'd rather a bum than a wanna be thug. Hey, who you think you talking to? You cage nigga, back up. (Spade laughs) It's all good. Listen, I'm a, I'm gonna let that slide. Cause you and I, we do have history, right? But hey, don't forget who house you in. Please tell me where my son is. He is out, robbing somebody's house right now. Who's? You gonna love this shit. Wait for it (laughs) hold on, Bitch Ass. Cecil's fucking house. I forgot his name was Cecil. Spade, what the fuck is wrong with you? Hasn't he suffered enough? You fucking pathetic ass hole. Who the fuck you think you're talking to? I told you to show me some fucking respect. I decide when somebody has suffered enough. I told your boy, Bitch Ass, we was gonna be back. And I'm a man of my fucking word. Now, they should have been back already. And we was just about to go check on that. Would you like to roll? You just take me to my fucking son. Okay. Boots, grab that heat and let's go. You do see why I like her though, right? I don't get it. That bitch mean. It's the bald head. (suspenseful music) (Q groans) (fist thuds) [Spade] Let's hurry up and get this kid, man. Sure nobody in there? Nope. Is it locked? [Boots] Yes. You know what, just kick the door in. Wait, can we knock first? And say what? We sent some kids here to rob you have you seen them? Hey, you wanna find Q or not? Okay, fine. Just kick it down, man. Back up. - Oh. (door thuds) [Spade] There it is. Hey look, I know what your grandma did to you. It was fucked up, man. But you don't have to do this. I saw your yearbook. You knew my mom, Marsia. (suspenseful music) So, can I ask you a weird question? (ethereal music) Yeah, I guess. Yo, what's up with the suit. Grandma says treat every day, like Sunday and the Lord will always be with you. It's kind of her saying. Okay, I like that. So uh, we're your parents? They died in a car accident when I was little. You know my parents aren't around either. I never really knew my dad and my mom, well, she ain't around. Spade and his mom took me in. They looked out for me. Is that why you with that jerk? No, I love him. You know, he's not such a bad guy. He just acts that way, cause his dad is the leader of sixth street. You know, we're gonna get a place together and get outta here. If you say so. So, why you like games so much? Because anyone can play, it doesn't matter who you are. There's a game for everyone. Okay, then what's your game? All right. Don't laugh. Rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors. Really? Ain't that kind of boring? I mean there's no board, there's no pieces, there ain't shit. That's why it's great. You can play it anywhere. Plus it's part instinct, part luck, which makes it the purest game ever invented. Okay, then let's do it. All right. So we'll go 1, 2, 3. Yeah, I got it. All right. 1, 2, 3, shoot. But, you don't have to do this. (door thuds) Man, you still smoke cigarettes? Shit gonna kill you. Shut up. (alarm buzzes) Ladies first. Got a stank attitude. Just need to get in here and find my baby, stop playing. [Spade] Always did wanna come inside this house. [Marsia] Spade! [Spade] Let's go upstairs, man. (alarm buzzes) Wait, hey, wait! Hey wait! Let me go! (eerie suspenseful music) (door creaks) Q? Where is he? Will you chill out? Look, maybe they left already or just waiting for us back at the house. Well, then where is Cecil? Yeah, the hell if I know. His bitch ass probably ran away or he hiding somewhere. Why do you hate him so much? Because he disrespected me. (Marsia sighs) Oh god. I remember this photo. It was before you were so concerned about respect. Outta here, man. I miss this kid. Help me! Somebody help, please! (eerie spooky music) (Q breathing heavily) So what? So what happened? What happened? I grew up, is what happened. You didn't have to become this. I didn't have no choice. You knew my dad was counting on me. I was counting on you. (chess piece clanks) (keys rattle) (door creaks) That's a dope mask. You know, I should have just fucking killed your fat board game head ass that day. What's the matter stutter mouth, cat go your tu, tu, tu. - Shut up! (intense spooky music) (Boots grunts) All right, got that retarded strength, huh? (Bitch Ass grunts) (punches thud) Get your bitch ass up. (punches thud) (table crashes) Come on. Q. (footsteps stomp) Yo, go this way. I'm gonna go that way. (punch thuds) (men groaning) (Bitch Ass howls) (Bitch Ass growls) (somber music) Cecil? Oh my god, what did they do to you? (gun clicks) Surprise. Damn, Bitch Ass Cecil. (punch thuds) (Marsia screams) Where the fuck is my crew? I'm not asking you again. Where the fuck is my... Spade. Just let me talk to him. Then hurry up and talk to him. Shit. Please, my son came here tonight. His name is Q. Where is he? Is he still here? Please, Cecil. Look, man, enough of this dumb shit, man. No! I'm not gonna let you do this to him again. Wait you not gonna let me? No. You not gonna let me. You were just as guilty as I was for what happened to him back in the day or did you forget? (bells chiming) (suspenseful music) I need your help. What is it? I need you to get Bitch Ass alone. Nah, nah man. Babe, listen, he, he made look stupid. I can't just let that go. Look, I'm not gonna hurt him. I just wanna scare him. I love you. Don't you love me? Yeah. Then will you do it? You promise you're not gonna hurt him, right? I swear. (eerie music) (laughs) Shit, wait, you didn't know, did you? Yeah, you need to hear this. Did you really think it was a coincidence that you went down the alley that day? (cars whooshing) Where are we? Oh, it's a shortcut. Let's go that way. All right. (suspenseful music) Think you forgot this, Bitch Ass. You thought you was gonna get away with making me look stupid. I, I said, sorry. Well, that ain't good enough. And now you with my girl, again. We weren't doing anything. Funny, cause whenever I see you, it look like you're doing a lot of something. I just want to get outta here. Yo, Boots, grab this nigga. Again, I'm tired of this nigga, man. (eerie music) (feet rustling) (punches thud) Spade, come on, don't. No, don't, leave him alone. That's enough. No, please, don't do it. Don't, don't do that. Please. Do it. (Blade slashing) Stop! Leave him alone. [Man] Stop it, that's enough. [Marsia] Stop! That's enough. (car tires screeching) (car horn honks) Oh shit, it's his grandma. (Marsia crying) Babe, come on, we gotta go. Yo, come on. We gotta get outta here. - I'm so sorry. (Grandma wailing) (Bitch Ass grunting) Cecil, I'm so sorry. You sorry to him? We're here looking for your kid and you're sorry to him? You sorry. (intense eerie music) [Spade] Ahh! No, no Cecil. Cecil. (Marsia screams) Stop! (Bitch Ass grunting) I'm sorry. (punch thuds) (thud on the floor) (bell gongs) (suspenseful eerie music) (Marsia moans) Spade. (Spade whimpers) Spade! (Spade gasps) You all right? - What the fuck. (table clatters) Are you all right? What kind of shit is this? What are you doing? Cecil? Let us the hell outta here, man. Where's my son? Where's Quentin? Your son is alive, for now. We must play. You know what fine? Cause after I beat you, I swear to God. I'm gonna kill your ass. The game is called Mayday. The objective of this game is to shoot down the opponents plane. Marsia, you will tell us if there's a hit or a miss. You lie, your son dies. You mother fucker. Let's play. Promise you, I ain't gonna lose. (cards clack) (dice clatter) (suspenseful music) D four.
