It's there, in the bones, like marrow, so hard to extract. - What are you getting at? - My old friend, you've made a convincing case, and I would be sold on that account, if it weren't for one small piece of information. Tommy never had a brother! - Why would you lie to us? Why, Tommy? Order in the court! - Not so fast. I'd like to see further evidence on this point. As far as I'm concerned-- - As far as you're concerned, you're here to deal out justice. Don't you know your place. You're no more real than the tales he tells. You're only part and parcel of the project of absolution, as am I. - What is the meaning of this absurd statement? I demand an explanation! - Oh, the meaning, if only it were so simple. You see, I've had my time, justifying, rationalizing, denying, defending him, as it were. That we are here now confirms my failure. We both know which way this court leans. - Order! - Excuse me. Your Honor, the prosecution must review the case in light of the new evidence. - In the labyrinth of one's mind, who can claim to know the significance of one memory or another. The question remains, how does one break free? Interrupt the cycle of guilt and clear an opening, a space for redemption. - How dare you utter the forbidden word! You speak in clever riddles, old man. I'm after the truth. - A slippery thing. - The court has heard enough.

She says you dream about killing your brother, yet you never had a brother, is that right? Strange thing. The mind is complex, as you know, memory being one of its more unpredictable functions. According to the most current research, when the mind remembers an event, it's not the actual event that is recalled but merely the memory of the last time you remembered it. Eventually, we add elements, change the order of things. Sometimes we manage to conjure up characters who never even existed. - And what does that make you? - So you wanna get smart with me? What is it, Tommy? What grim tale are you so afraid to tell? Excuse me. I seem to have lost myself. Air's a bit stale in here. Would you mind opening the window? Tell me about your mother. - I don't have a mother. - You don't have a mother. Incredible, that must be a first. Tell me, how can one be born without a mother? - I killed her. You can kill your mother just by being born. - So, the rumors are true. What about the brother? - My twin? He was never born. He died in the womb. They had to cut her open to take me out, and she had a stroke. They say her heart stopped the moment I came out. - My god, that explains a lot, now doesn't it? Twins, one dies, one lives, and a maternal death, what a way to begin, what a weight. How can one live up to that? Two lives for the price of one? Tell me about your relationship. - Well, what's to tell? - Are you happy? - At times. She complains. - About what? - About me. My work. - What type of work do you do? - Social work, domestic violence. - That's a noble cause. - I think so. - So what's the problem. - Well, she questions my intentions. - Well, what are your intentions? - I don't know.

Do you have to clean the entire house? I'm trying to study, if you didn't notice. - Whaddya readin' anyway? - Just now I was getting into this book here. It's for a class on gender and sexuality. - It's in French. - Yeah, I thought I could learn French while studying for the class. - Oh, yeah, good idea. - Right, well, this one is amazing. I mean, it's actually devastating to read. It's kind of a memoir of the author's history of sexual abuse by men. - I know what it means to be a woman. I don't need books to tell me. There's more than one kind of violence. I've been around enough to know. I mean, what's the plan, man? Will you save women once and for all with the ink of your pen? What do you know about it? There's no textbook, you know? You can't read about that and expect to understand it. - Hey, I love you. - Then love me. Quit loving your books. It doesn't make it more true if you repeat it in French. Does not sound pretty, whatever you said. - I said, "Tell me you love me, too." Or don't you? - There aren't words for everything. Tommy, be gentle with me. I promise to be nice. - No promises, be gentle. You can. And it's always like that. We kiss, kiss, kiss. Then he disappears, goes down to whisper secrets in between my legs. But I wonder sometimes if it's not more for him than it is for me, as if he whispers to himself. And the sound of my pleasure returns his gift, like an echo, as if I'm just an echo box. Well, you have to be empty to be a good echo box. In the end, it's hard to understand how to receive a gift that was taken from you to begin with. And I'll tell you another thing. To understand Tommy, you have to know that the softest skin on his whole body is here, the skin on the bottom side of this thing when it's hard. And that's the secret. If you understand that, you can understand how to love a man. - Hey. No, I wanna be inside of you. - Typically, he refuses. In fact, Tommy's favorite word is no. Loving is easy. To be loved, that takes courage. - Oh shit. - What's the rush? - I forgot I have a class today. I'm late. - Why do you always rush to rinse off so quickly? - Well, 'cause I'm late.

That you don't suffocate both yourself and the one you supposedly hold most dear? - Well, I suppose-- - I suppose you believe yourself to be the true guardian of your love? Can't you see you've come to resent her, like a child resents a mother whose warmth he yet craves? - I-- - Must love and freedom be so relentlessly opposed?

I fell for Tommy the dreamer, bright eyes, twin stars, so full of charm, so sweet and warm. You held me fast between your rigid arms.

But even so, you come and go, and I, the solid ground, the tether pole your orbit turns around, well, I remain. Didn't I keep watch for you? Hold fast the thread attached to you? To watch as it unwound? To count your steps and remind you of the way back home? Good earth, good womb, good wife too. What was I but a ball of clay for you? Your secret fears like fingers crept behind my eyes and made them shine. You carved a mouth tuned to the tenor of your name. My hair grew long, became a nest for you, and I felt my brow grow heavy with your pain. Even now, my sadness bores you. You no longer want me, but you cannot let me go. Well, here is your longed-for freedom. I was only in your way, but now it's my time for me to flee, to rediscover my own right of way. I go tonight out from these walls built by fear. You wear me out. Let me go to the place where I have not yet arrived. Goodbye my love, my breath, my life.

I thought I was the one you chose to pay for the sins of a world full of men too scared to be alone! - If only it were so simple. But you can't pass guilt around that way. It's much too sticky, you see. Much like glue, it sticks to you just as soon as you've passed it to me! And you're still forgetting one thing. There's still one more charge to this hearing. Let's hear what the Defense has to say. He's been oh so quiet since the scales have tipped my way! - Does the Defense wish to call a witness? Does the Defense have a final statement? - There goes your last chance, boy! I guess it's up to you. - Does the accused have any last words? ♪ Do you have any last words ♪ ♪ Yes please, yes sir, I do, sir ♪ ♪ But I don't know just how I can say this ♪ ♪ My heart beats much too quickly ♪ ♪ And I feel that I might explode ♪ ♪ So rare that I fail to find the right words ♪ ♪ Typically they come right from my golden tongue ♪ ♪ Like a river flows, but now, I don't know ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ - Woo! Hm. - Order! The Prosecution may make a final statement. - There is nothing so arbitrary as a fence around a plot of land or a body with a line around it. And what have we here but an empty frame! A rusted, barbed-wire fence, there's nothing there, no property, no ground on which to build a foundation, the basic building blocks of what we commonly call love. The story begins with two nascent twins, bound together in the mother's warmth. But what was for one a nurturing womb would become for the other a dark and deathly tomb. They did everything they could to save the second child, and their efforts weren't in vain. But with her hand held fast by her desperate love, the mother died from the physical strain. And there he was, our unlucky boy, a life wrought in exchange for two. And as the father refused to hold him close, he learnt from day one the debt that was due, so he searched for a way to earn his very life! He found a thousand different ways to tell the story of his loss and a means to exonerate, but in every corner, a finger pointed, a swelling sea of shame. Buried in books, he found his mother on every single page. Along comes Carolyn, poor girl. What need I say? We've all witnessed her tale, just one of the more tragic of his attempts to find his place. Oh, the irony of a man who champions the safety and care of women but cannot love the one who waits with open arms beside him. A true dialogue of compassion between flesh and blood is replaced by the idea, the mere image of love. And so poor Carolyn was sacrificed to his self-serving crusade, a sad little man with a sorry tale and a whole wide world to save, which brings us here today. And what do we make of this lady, Yes, such a strange and unheard name. But it's all too clear if the jury knows that his favorite word was always no. And what is it that he refuses? What are these secret fears of yours? Why do you tremble at the thought of losing your grip? What is this property that you clench with white knuckles? Are not your hands wrapped around her very throat? Is it not her skin that you wear like a wreath around your neck, or a crown of thorns? Are not her bones the very frame that kept you sane and composed? And without this frame, he would scatter like dust! The infinite uncertainty of Yes, yes to the mystery of suffering that cannot be explained, yes to the life you've been given despite or because of its inaugural pain. yes to the one who would love you in spite of yourself, to the love she gave, not meant to be earned, nothing to pay back, no price in return, for love is not much like a bartered exchange, and yes to the past, for the joy and the pain. But no was your preferred response, a disposition of denial. But a pain repressed will be otherwise expressed, and hence our gathering today. And so it is, the final charge against you, that you have slain the lady, Yes, woman who wades through a sea of names but who cannot be allowed to speak, who sings instead, whose voice quivers softly, high above your little fortress of fear. She is the tremor of silence, the whisper of possibility, the fluidity within your very own soul that you have made rigid, petrified to supply the lie to your feeble mind that behind your name, something real resides. To tell the truth, I pity you, for who knew that a true dialogue was one without speech? Two pairs of unblinking eyes, an exchange of beating hearts. Two lips poised, half open, ready to speak, but never speaking a single word, except one word, yes. ♪ Yes to the invisible ♪ ♪ Yes for you, is it impossible ♪ ♪ Yes to a mystery unsolved ♪ ♪ Yes, the hardest word of them all ♪ ♪ Oh, isn't that precisely it, a mystery you can resist ♪ ♪ You can't quite get your finger on it ♪ ♪ Just like a child destroys a butterfly ♪ ♪ You tear the wings off to decipher ♪ ♪ Where it is the secret lies ♪ ♪ You destroy the ones you love the most ♪ ♪ When you can't stand a thing unknown ♪ ♪ Yes to a mystery unsolved ♪ ♪ Yes, the hardest word of them all ♪ ♪ Oh, careful, Mr. Tommy Silver ♪ ♪ You didn't really kill her ♪ ♪ Though she died, the guilt is only in your mind ♪ ♪ The judgment that you carry is hardly arbitrary ♪ ♪ It's only what you've brought upon yourself ♪ ♪ You pulled the carpet, ooh, you pulled the carpet ♪ ♪ From underneath your own feet ♪ ♪ And you will end up all alone ♪ ♪ If you can't stand up on your own ♪ - Take him away. - What?
