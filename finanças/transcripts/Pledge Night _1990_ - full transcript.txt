Okay scum, listen up! Our fraternity president Rex gills got pinned today. That's why we treat 'em down, it's tradition. Now if you wanna join the serenade with the other brothers over at the gamma house. Silvera, who's his girl? That blonde I see him with? Who's his girl silvera? You oughta know, she's one of your little sisters! I can't remember. I know her, I see her around the house right regularly. In the beginning of your pledgeship you were given a phi-ep paddle to take around and have each brother sign. Once you memorized his name, hometown, girlfriend, and girlfriend sorority, silvera did you pass our fraternity president over? Sir, no sir! You pledges, you'll never make it through hell week. Well? Does anyone know his girl's name? Sir! I believe it is Wendy Ainsley, sir. Gamma house, hometown Pittsburgh. Wrong, bonner. But sir... Yes bonner? Speak up, I can't hear you bonner. Sir, I know her and I'm almost positive I'm right. Right? Is it ever right to show up another pledge brother? Down on your knees bonner! Give me 50 push-ups! Now tomorrow begins hell week. For three days you'll have a unique opportunity to go through a series of pressure situations. And the fraternity gets to test your loyalty to see just what you're made of. Now your meals will be cooked by your pledge class little sister who will be occupying the house mother's room which is, as always, strictly off limits. Sir, is Dan still here? Dan's still here, and he'll be staying right here at the house for the entire semester break. Why, sir? Well most of the brothers have left for home already, but Dan needs the comfort of familiar surroundings. I know he's been acting a little strange lately. Don't think the other brothers haven't see it. Well it looks like he's got himself a brain tumor. One of those they say affects both perception and behavior. He's scheduled for surgery next week, try to help him. He deserves your loyalty because he is a brother. Eat on the square pledges! Say Dan, I hear you'll be living in the house through hell week. Yeah. Great, you can get to see the pledges go through the same shit we went through. Dan and I were in the same pledge class. Right Danny? You all right Dan? Don't just stare at it, clean it up! Hey Danny, come on. It's all right. We all understand and we all love you. Hey! Danny, stop it! Sit down bonner. She's Rex's girl, let him handle it. Danny! Rex! Stop it Danny, come on stop! Hey buddy, hold on there, you can't do that. Are you all right hun? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Did he hurt you? You sure? Somebody help him, he's been stabbed! Quick, let's get him to the hospital. It's all right buddy, stay with me. Hang on. Oh god, it hurts! Just hang on. Oh god! Drive him careful. Hey Rex, just don't bleed all over my car man. Sir, is anybody calling the police? Pledges do not speak to an officer unless they are spoken to first, bonner. They're taking him to the hospital and nobody calls the police. What? Dan's in trouble and he's a brother, so don't tell another living soul. Understand? No, I don't suppose you do understand because you're not in phi-ep yet. But I guarantee before hell week is over you'll understand the meaning of phi epsilon nu loyalty. That is, if you make it through. Danny's great. Best bad man yet and I've seen four of them now. I think you're right man. Hey Rex, you remember our pledge class bad man Eddie tesdale? Oh god. Oh I remember him, what a creep. Ew. Hey, let me get a greasy Tony special. I feel like a chili dog with lots of ketchup. You guys, what happens if one of those pledges goes to the police? Well then they're out. O-u-t. Besides, what could we really be charged with huh? Practical joking? Okay pledges! Be back here tonight. 8 o'clock sharp. You'll be here for three days. Initiation's Monday night. If you make it through. So go back to your dorms, your homes, and pack enough clothing and personal supplies to last through hell week. You'll be living here at the house during that time. Am I understood? Sir, yes sir! Hi ma. Hi Larry. Can't you wait until dinner? I had dinner at the house. Wasn't very filling was it? It was okay. Pork chops. I just came back to pack a bag. And to finish that firewood. Yeah. Mom, look, I'm staying at the house over the weekend. I'll be back after Monday night, so I can do most of this after then okay? What's going on at the house? It's hell week. After that comes initiation. I thought the university had abolished hazing years ago. Isn't there a state law against it? Ma, nobody pays attention to that anymore. Larry, it's dangerous! Yeah, but it's tradition. And besides, it serves a real purpose. What? Well I guess it's up to us to find out what that purpose is. I guess that's the purpose of hell week. Do you know why your fraternity happens to occupy that house? I don't know, I think it's been there for years. Less than 20 years. Before that another fraternity occupied that house, but they lost their charter and they had to disband. And do you know why they were forced off campus? Because they killed a boy. I never heard that. Was it an accident? It wasn't done on purpose, but it happened. Look ma, I'll be careful. Sometimes being careful doesn't help. Yeah, like when your number's up your number's up right? Look ma, I gotta go. I'll see you Monday okay? What's your name? Dirty pledge Richard Goodman, sir. And why are you a dirty pledge? Because I am unclean, sir. Why are you unclean? Because I am a dirty pledge, sir. Who are you? Sir, I am scum. The lowest form of life, sir. - Bodine, what time is it? - It is time for scum to learn its obligations to its fellow scum, sir. And silvera, what is a gentleman? A gentleman handles emergencies, handles obscurities, and handles deformities. Cagle, do you know what is a gentleman? Sir, the true gentleman is a man whose conduct proceeds from goodwill and a true sense of propriety. Whose self-control is equal to all emergencies. Who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his inferiority or deformity. A man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe. Do you believe what you just said is right cagle? Sir, yes sir. Do you believe it is right to show up another pledge brother? Down on your knees and give me 100 push-ups now! You scum will never learn will you? But the fun is just beginning. Tonight we're having our annual phi-ep cherry race. Okay, time! Who's the winner jd? It was close chip, but the blue team made 13 trips. The gold team's 12. And who is the captain of the gold team? Sir I am sir. Swallow the spoils of war. Wait. Are you going to let a brother eat that cherry? - Sir, no sir. - Sir, no sir. Swallow the spoils of war. Sir! I will eat those cherries for my brothers, sir! Bonner, cagle, put down those cherries. We have found the true winner of the phi-ep cherry race is indeed the winning team captain. But his teammates did not volunteer. They were not willing to sacrifice for their brothers. So it is they who will swallow the spoils of war. Now eat those fucking cherries to remember the spirit of brotherhood. You guys have been great. You know, it's only the first night of hell week. But you know, we wanna reward you. We wanna give you an opportunity to left off a little steam, so tonight, tonight we're having our annual phi-ep pledge class pig party. Wait a minute, wait a minute, before you dickheads start getting stiff, the house wants to remind you of something. What sir? Oh that's for you to figure out. And just to remind you, we're going to tie a string around your little weenies. And on the other end of the string, hanging outside your shirt, will be a symbol of your subservience and low status within the fraternity. What's the matter, silvera? Well it's like so embarrassing. What if one of the girls asks me what the symbol's for? Well silvera, you're only allowed to say one thing. Pull it and find out. Mind me asking you a personal question Larry? Nah, shoot. Well I'm just in high school, so I don't know about these things. But how come you guys got corncobs hanging around your necks? Pull it and find out. What's that dried out piece of corn for? Is it some kind of fraternity ritual? Pull it and find out. I've been meaning to ask you. What's this thing you got hanging around your neck? You know what, why don't you suck me off and find out? Hey. Hey let's turtle! Having a good time guys? Yeah. Yeah man, like this must be why they call phi epsilon nu the fun house. You boys are so close to being brothers now, why don't you take your lady friend up to the boom boom room. Hey all right. All right. You go first. Nah, you go first. No bodine, you go first. Hey, don't I get a choice? No that's okay, you go first. Hi. Hi. 1 can get it. Oh yeah. J racing down the road j in a speed machine of steel j gears are jammed in full j I'm the madman at the wheel j got my foot pinned to the floor j you can feel the engine roar j I got thunder in my hands j I'm metal thrashing mad j yeah j I'm metal thrashing mad j yeah j driving like a maniac j can't go any faster j burning up the road j and heading for disaster j got my foot pinned to the floor j you can feel the engine roar j I got thunder in my hands hey cagle, what kind of boat are you getting? Oh my god, what is that? Who is that? [T sounded more like a what to me. Well baby, that there's not just a what. That just happens to be one of our brothers. Sounded like an animal to me. Hey where's Alice? I think she's gone to the boom boom room. Oh shit man, she was boating it? Yeah, I think zahn's gonna get some too. Oh man. Chill down bonner, this is a pig party. Yeah, but the girls don't know that do they? Who knows and who cares. Cagle come on, I went to high school with these girls, I know them. Oh, I keep forgetting you're a townie. Well look, just because you already had some of this town's primo pork, don't spoil it for the rest of us. J racing down the road j in a speed machine of steel j gears are jammed in full j I'm the madman at the wheel j got my foot pinned to the floor j you can feel the engine roar j I got thunder in my hands j I'm metal thrashing mad j got my foot pinned to the floor j you can feel the engine roar j I got thunder in my hands j I'm metal thrashing mad We examine the pledge paddles you've made to see if every one has the signatures of all our brothers and our little sisters. Goodman, go up there and take down that paddle on the far right. Yes sir. Now I want you to look at it. Examine it closely. Tell me, do you find it acceptable? Sir, this is not the paddle that I carved. Yes Goodman, we know that, but do you find it a bit irregular? Well it's got... Answer yes or no! Yes sir! Do you find it acceptable enough to be in the house, especially when guests come? Probably took 20 minutes to make it. Who made this paddle? Sir, I did sir! Putit in the fire. You've made the wrong decision, Goodman. This paddle represents the blood and spirit of our fraternity to bonner. One of your pledge brothers made this paddle. It represents a relationship. A bond. Maybe he isn't an artist, but it is a visible expression of how he felt. Goodman, assume the position. Thank you sir, may I have another sir? Thank you sir, may I have another sir? Thank you sir, may I have another sir? Get up, Goodman. The little sisters are here with our groceries and we can't let them see this. Whoa, you've got the jitters. Yeah, suppose so. You know, you seem pretty calm for somebody whose boyfriend just got knifed yesterday. Oh well I'm here to be at the service of the fraternity, I mean that's what Rex would've wanted me to do. Yeah, Wendy, you know I know I'm not even supposed to be talking to you, but I gotta know how is Rex? The other pledge masters won't even mention him. I mean is he alive? Sure, he's fine, it was just a surface wound. A surface wound? Come on, I saw him get stabbed. I'm sorry, it was all a joke, you asshole. Oh my god, I hope no one calls the police. You know last year a couple of the pledges started calling the police... What? You mean he wasn't really stabbed? Well sure he was stabbed, in a bag full of chicken blood that we got from the veterinary school. Oooh, you're kidding. No. Well then what's with Dan mcclarin? All right, you promise not to tell the other pledges? Yeah, I swear, what? Tell me. All right, Dan is this year's bad man. You see every year they pick a brother to act nuts and terrorize all the other pledges. It's like this phi-ep tradition. Oh. Really? Well don't worry, I mean they would never really hurt you. Bonner, why aren't you in the kitchen peeling potatoes and scrubbing pots with the rest of the scum? I furthermore promise and swear that I will support and obey the constitution of the fraternity and the bylaws and edicts which may from time to time be enacted by the grand council and by the chapter of which I shall become a member. All of this I do solemnly and sincerely swear on my honor as a man, on the love that I bear for my mother, and on my hopes of salvation. Good, now assume the position. It's okay to scream, in fact we expect you to. It helps let off steam. Richard zahn, do you feel you are worthy of being hurt for your fraternity? Sir, yes sir! Shit man. Jesus, is it worth it? [Tis to me. My father was a phi-ep. One of the first Jewish phi-eps on campus. You knew he was branded? No, I never knew that. But if he were, I guess it never hurt him. He owns three Toyota dealerships. What about you bonner? You're a townie. What does your dad say about fraternities? My dad's dead. I'm sorry bonner, when did you lose him? Well actually I never knew him, he died before I was born. All right scumbodies, who's next? Sir. I'll be next, sir. I swear to uphold the laws which from time to time may be enacted by the grand council and by the chapter of which I shall become a member. To all this I most solemnly swear on my honor as a man, on a love that I bear for my mother, and on my hopes for salvation. Who are you? Sir, I am a nothing but a nothing. A scum. The lowest form of life, sir. Bonner, you don't seem to be the least bit intimidated by this initiation, are you? Sir, no sir. Well then, assume the position. Lawrence bonner, do you feel you are worthy of being hurt for your fraternity? Sir, yes sir! What are you crazy? What's wrong with you? Shhh, forget it, forget it. It'll give us something to show the other pledges to keep them in line. Bonner! Hey bonner, your mother's here. She wants to see you. What? Get dressed, douchebag! Your mama wants to see you. Why? 'Cause she won't go away, that's why! Now get up, let's go! Hi mom. Sit down Larry, I wanna talk to you. Ma. Oh! I'm worried about you Larry. Look, this is all just a big game. I got it all figured out, really. You know actually, you'd be impressed. We got a black guy, we got a Jew. Silvera, he's Italian. So you see, at least we don't discriminate. Nice to know you're with an equal opportunity oppressor. Mom, 65% of all senators and congressmen, and 75% of all fortune 500 CEOs were members of college fraternities. I mean doesn't that tell you anything? Tells me why this country's in so much trouble. Come on ma, just because you were a hippy and never achieved anything yourself. Let me tell you something, Larry. Let me tell you about the boy who died. It happened in the late 60s. The fraternity brothers were preparing this mix for initiation. It was supposed to be a harmless mixture of cornflakes, coffee grounds, soda pop, and vinegar. My boyfriend sid was up first. I, Sidney snyder, swear I'll always do my obligation to my brothers. Binding myself to greater than my obligations. To no less penalty than having my name forever. Dishonored among men. My friends turned from me in loathing and I'll be an outcast in this world forever. May I never again know what it is to love what you love. So help me god. Now it is time to enter the world of true wisdom. The ultimate understanding. Which way to the protest? Hey silence! Sidney died the next day in the intensive care unit. The fraternity was forced to disband. Another fraternity, this one, moved into the house in 1970. The year you were born. The same house? The same house. Yeah, but it's not the same fraternity. Mom, you're being overprotective again. I've had to be both mother - and father to you, Larry. - And father to you, Larry. I know. Look ma, I gotta go. Nobody else's mother visits them during hell week. It's bad enough I'm a townie. I'll see you Monday night okay? Hi. Hi. Was that your mom? Yeah. Everything okay at home? Oh yeah. She's just worried about me, that's all. I never should've told her this is hell week. It's got her all freaked out. I know what you mean. If my mom knew I was taking care of you guys she'd be all freaked out too. But the eggs sure look good. Well we're glad that you like them bonner 'cause that's just what you're getting for breakfast. Eat it, silvera. Chew it. Good huh? Goodman is in his position working for you and you're just lying there letting him do it. But remember, when Goodman hits the ground, you swallow the egg. It's okay, do it. Hey bonner, you can't do that. But sir, he's my brother sir. Very good, bonner. What are they doing downstairs? I think they're learning another lesson of hell week. What's that? Well that no matter what anyone says you always help a brother. So what's the lesson we're coating in anchovy paste? I think it's obedience. Ew. Gross! Come on, cagle. I can't. Come on cagle, take a bite. Go ahead cagle, eat that turd if you wanna be a brother. We all did it. I can't! Maybe he thinks he's better than us. Do you cagle? Sir, no sir! Then eat that turd now! Lick it, cagle! Eat it. Eat it, you wanna be a brother cagle? Eat that turd cagle! Eat it! One of these days maybe you'll be alone in the forest and this will be all you have to eat. Look good silvera? Sir, no sir. But you'll eat them if you want phi epsilon nu won't you silvera? Sir, yes sir. Silvera, do you realize why I'm feeding you these worms? Why it's the same reason cagle was in the bathroom this morning eating some shit. Remember last month when I asked you pledges what you do to an enemy of the fraternity without killing him? Cagle said he'd make them eat shit, and you said... Bugs. Bugs. Apparently you detest them. Therefore we've devised your own custom made torture. It's what you fear most. Applied directly to you. Open wide, silvera. One last box of goodies, just in case you're alone and hungry in New York City. This is priceless. So where's the COD liver oil? I think it's in the pantry, I don't know. Oh, now look, this has to have exact measurements, so use your measuring cups okay? Couldn't we substitute monterey Jack for limburger cheese? No, it wouldn't smell the same. Come on, didn't you get any at the safeway? No, but they had the - anchovies! - Anchovies! At ease, scumbags! Move out girls, come on. Let's go. It's time for your phi-ep cocktails made especially for hell week by our little sisters. It's up to you to figure out how to drink it, but you must drink it. We got Dan stationed nearby to make sure he doesn't hear any plumbing sounds like sinks being rinsed or toilets flushing. So chug-a-lug. Oh, by the way, we'll be back in an hour so make sure it's all gone. There's not even any windows in this basement to throw it out of. What are we gonna do with this shit? I don't wanna drink it. Maybe we can stick it up our assholes? Or we could rub it on our hair and body. We've got to drink it. That's what they want and that's what they and others before them have done. He's right. Let's stop putting it off and be men about it. Hold your nose if it helps, and we'll do it together. That's what they're after. Unity through shared experience. A toast. To the fraternity. To the fraternity! Ugh! Oh god. You know what I say? Let's all call it a night before they can think of more things to put us through. Yeah. No sheets again. This is no honeymoon, bodine. This is hell week. Let's just get some sleep. Without a shower? I don't mind the whiff of somebody else, but when I begin to smell bad it just offends me. I mean they wouldn't turn in without a shower would they? Yeah, but they're brothers already. Will you all just shut the hell up? Somebody get the light. Maybe they'd want us to turn off the lights together. Kiss my ass, Goodman. You are an ass, bodine. But you're my brother. Your Europeans don't have them. Neither do your communists. In fact, only in America do we find the grand institution of college fraternities. It's our college fraternity culture that shapes America's young leaders. Generation after generation. The Greek way. It's one of the ways that America is made great. Chip, why don't you go keep an eye on Dan for us will you? Sure thing. It is brotherhood that makes leaders of men. Unity that leads to success. Shared experience through stress and turmoil that garners the truest of friendship. The phi epsilon nu eternal bond. Dan! Danny? Dan. Dan, you up there? According to figures from the inter-fraternity council from the 1920s to the present, an average of only 9% of college graduates were associated with Greek letter fraternities. But a recent poll of congress revealed that 65% of congressmen were college fraternity members. Danny! Use the other bathroom! Danny? Dan! Danny! You pledges for so long purse the secret. And then you will learn why phi epsilon nu is commonly referred to as the fun house. Dan! Oh Danny, Christ! Did you go in the second floor bathroom? It's Tom. He's just lying there, blood all around. You're kidding. No man, he's totally dead! What will happen when phi-ep national finds out? The university, they'll revoke our charter! What'll happen to the phi-ep building? Rush! This could really hurt our reputation next year at rush, all the best freshman athletes will go right over to the sigma chis! So did you really think? Wow, I had you this time! Oh man, you had me going. Absolutely, I mean would you give me a break and save this shit for the pledges? Not when I got suckers like you around. Okay man, no more bullshit all right? We've had enough. That Dan man sure can holler can't he? Phi epsilon nu means philosophers of numerian. Numerian, our fraternity's spiritual leader, was an emperor in Rome in the year 284 ad. The affable manners and gentle virtues of the emperor numerian secured him in the public's fine regard. His constitution was destroyed by the persian war and he had contracted from the heat of the climate such a weakness in the eyes it obliged him to confine himself to the solitude and darkness of his tent. To honor the imperial tent of numerian, we have darkened our own lodge. Go away, will you? I'll be out in a few minutes! Reports soon circulated throughout the emperor's camp of numerian's death. The soldiers had not beheld their emperor for almost a year as he was represented by his chief council. The prefect aper. For nine months aper ruled the empire in numerian's stead. Who's there? Jd, is that you? Are you crazy? Get the hell outta here! Hey there little sister! Get out, goddammit! Can't you see I'm trying to... Let's party! At last, a crowd of curious soldiers burst into the imperial tent and discovered... Numerian's corpse. Behold. The coffin of numerian. Concealment of the corpse of numerian was interpreted as evidence of guilt. A tribunal was erected in the middle of the camp and generals and tribunes formed a grand military council. They chose the noble diocletian to succeed their beloved numerian. Diocletian ascended the tribunal, and assuming the tone of a sovereign and judge, demanded that the prefect aper be brought before him. Where have you been? Where does it look like I've been Einstein? Wendy and I went food shopping for tonight's initiation banquet. Boy I bet you'll be glad when this is over. Being bad man is worse than pledging. Yeah. Tomorrow you can stop acting so crazy. Where's Wendy? She went back to the gamma house to pick something up, but she'll be back soon. So how are those boys treating you? Okay. Heard you guys had yourselves a pig party the other night. I just don't understand girls like that. Why would they go to a pig party? Maybe they didn't know. Didn't know it was a pig party? Oh come on, all they had to do was look around. Where were the phi-ep little sisters: Wendy, your sweetheart, and the rest of us gammas? I mean come on. It's not as though they attended college or anything, they're townies. Girls that work in a factory or a five and dime that don't have the background to attend college. Maybe they just don't have the brains or their parents just don't have the money. Here, let me do that. Dan, come on, that's a little bit. Dan, what are you doing? You're so silly. I thought you were a real straight kind of guy. Ow! Ow! Goddammit... Shut up. Dan, someone's gonna come in, don't... This man, declared diocletian, is the murderer of numerian. Then he drew his sword, burying it in the chest of the prefect aper. No. Behold. The sword of diocletian. Enough of this shit! Stay right here scum. Chip and I will be right back. Chip! Danny! Tom! Tom, you up there? Oh Danny. I think jd and the brothers might be in trouble. We should go up there and check it out. No way zahn, it's all too weird. It's just another one of their tricks to blame us for doing something wrong. Cagle's right, the screams are just to freak us out. Remember, we're confined to the basement until we're made brothers. Connie? I'm back! Connie? Now they got the girls goofing on us. Just relax and stay put. To leave would be disobedient. Let's not blow it. It was Connie! She's tied up in the kitchen and there is blood all over her. And her face is all mutilated. Oh my god. It's that guy Dan. They flat out told us he's got some serious screws loose. Look guys, I gotta tell you. All that stuff about Dan being crazy and needing brain surgery, it's all just a joke to scare us. It's true, you guys. Every year they pick a brother to act nuts and scare all the pledges. Why? I don't know, they think it promotes unity or something. See? I told you it was all just a joke. Dan. Hey Danny, what are you doing Dan? I'm not Danny. My name is sid. Don't you understand Dan? It's just a game, man. It's just a game, Dan. Oh you guys are big on games aren't you? What do you means we guys Dan? You're one of us, Dan. Danny, what are you doing? What's wrong? What, are you queer? Get off my, Danny what are you doing? I was never one of you, imperialist pig! Hey! Don't light it Dan! No no, don't do that Dan! Dan! You like the cherry race game, shithead? Let's see how you like the cherry bomb game. Want a light? Oh god. The keys! Come on. The keys, who's got the keys? Jd had it, only chip and jd. Hey you guys. Could have locked the door when I came in. Jesus Wendy! Come on guys, she didn't do it on purpose. You can all kiss my ass. I am getting out of here. What are you doing? I just told you, I'm getting out of here now! Look, whoever is out there is still in this house. I feel a lot safer locked down here where they can't get us. She's right guys. Look, the other brothers will be back Sunday night, we might as well just sit tight and try laying low. With no food? Shit. And what's with the lights? We don't pay the electric bill around here or what? They cut the lights from a switch upstairs when they told us numerian went blind remember? What a way to spend a Saturday night. Hey bonner, maybe your mother will show up again. Yeah bonner, did she say she was coming back? What was she doing here? She was just trying to talk me out of pledging. I don't expect her to come back. Your mother was here too? Trying to stop you? Yeah. She's always been on my back about being at this place. You're kidding, my old man would practically disown me if I didn't pledge a fraternity. Mine too. He'd think I'm some kind of failure. Yeah, well my mother, she's like this over the hill ex-hippy, you know? I mean she doesn't realize the sixties have come and gone. She still wear bellbottom pants and smokes dope during the day. Did she remarry? Yeah. And what does Mr. bonner do? His name's not bonner, my mother's name is bonner. I think she had me out of wedlock. That's what people did back then. Well mother's always right. This hell week business is a crock of shit. I should've pledged sigma chi. "Behold, the coffin of numerian!" Shit. Whoa! Oh man. This all better be just a joke. Which way to the protest? Zahn get out! Get out! Yo zombie! Who are you? Get out of here zahn! Get him cagle! Get him cagle! Come on man, fight back! Come on cagle! Come on, zombie! You got this cagle, fight back! Come on! Run! Run! Christ man, what was that? I don't know. Whatever it was, it wasn't human. Maybe it was the ghost of numerian. Poor cagle. Look what he did to my hand! Looks like a burn. Looks like you got his burns. I'm suing. I'm suing national phi-ep, and the university which is funded by the state, so I'm suing the goddamn state! You've got insurance? Would you guys shut up? Cagle is dead! What's that he put on cagle's chest? Sigma lota delta. I never heard of that fraternity. Sid, it says sid you idiot. Sid? What's a sid? Anybody know a sid? Jesus. That's what my mother came by to see me about yesterday. To tell me about sid. Your mother knows this guy? He was supposed to be her boyfriend. At least she told me about this guy named sid who died 20 years ago here in this house. He died how? It was an accident during hell week. They were throwing their pledges into this bathtub full of vinegar and some other crap, and by mistake the brothers put in some acid. Which burned this guy to death named Sidney snyder. Guys, I feel sick. Yeah, well don't look at zahn. Hey fuck you, bodine. I didn't see you standing up trying to fight this guy. It could've been you. I'm gonna be sick. What's happening? Christ! Christ, what the hell was that? Bodine, put your hand through the hole and unlock the door. Fuck you, buddy. You do it. Yeah, who knows what that shit is and what it could've done. I don't believe you guys. I'm gonna get to a phone and call the police. Come on! Fuck. Shit! Shit! Come on! Come on, there's a phone in here. Come on. Yeah, get me the police, this is an emergency. This is sheriff foster. Listen, there's this guy, he's trying to kill us. Phi epsilon nu house, it wasn't with a weapon. Yeah, he's killed two people already. One guy he strangled. Strangled, strangled how? His guts were hanging out of him right after we stabbed him with our sword. And the other guy, silvera, he just blew him apart and all these bugs came out of him. Please come right away to the phi ep house, 17 fraternity road, you know where that is! Are you a pledge? And what's your name? Richard zahn. Z-a-h-n. Richard, have you taken any LSD or been given any kind of hallucinogenic drug by any of the fraternity brothers? No. No, absolutely not. Just come please! No, no, I'm not! If we come over and find out there's been any kind of a hell week or a hazing, which is not only illegal in this state but a criminal offense, we'll have to file a report and get all you guys in an awful lot of trouble. And I don't wanna do that. We're already in a lot of trouble, we're all gonna get killed! Richard, go to sleep. Talk things over with the other pledges. You'll see, things will look different in the morning. Jesus Christ, man. Two of my friends are dead and you're telling me to sleep on it? Why don't you pledges stop wasting our time? My father is an attorney. When I tell him about this, he'll sue you! Goodnight. Richard! Richard, help me. Wendy? Richard. Who are you? Phi-ep pledge Richard zahn. Who's that? I don't know. Oh my god. Is that zahn? I hope not. Zahn was supposed to get to a phone. Aw Jesus. Bummer huh? Quick, hurry. Bodine. We have got to kill him before he kills us first. Yeah, but we can't kill him 'cause he's already dead. Bodine. He's been dead for 20 years, why did he pick tonight to come back? Sometimes spirits who have died a violent death sometimes come back to the scene of the crime. But then why hasn't anyone seen him before? Maybe he just didn't want to make himself known until now. Well what does he want from us? Why does he wanna kill us for no reason? Why? I'm not gonna let him do that. Bodine. Jesus Christ, you scared me. Did anyone get to the police? Zahn was supposed to. Zahn's dead. Jesus Christ. I'm looking for bodine. He's up here somewhere and he's got the sword. Goodman? Bonner. Get outta here. Get to a phone or something. You stay here. No. I'm not gonna just stay here and let sid get me. Besides, I feel safer with you. All right. Come on, quiet. Bodine, come on out. Come on out bodine, you got the sword. Who are you? Dirty pledge Richard Goodman sir! That's for spiro agnew. So where are the chicks? Get away from me! Get away from Mel! Get away from Mel! Who are you? I am Bob bodine! I am lowly scum, sir! Looks like you don't need your key. You think it's safe? No. But there might be another working phone. This one's dead too. Wait a minute, there's a private line upstairs. Get outta here. Who are you? We've gotta get outta here. No, you go into town, I'll try the phone upstairs. I can't leave you here. He's just a corpse. You've gotta come with me. You're my responsibility now. Hey, the last time you told me to get out of the house I didn't listen to you. I stuck around. You saved my life. I'll be right back with some help. Larry. Be careful. You're so beautiful. All I wanna do is touch you. Hey, I thought you went to get the police. We don't have to go all the way. You cock tease. If it feels good, do it! Wendy! Okay sid, let's have it out. Who are you? My name is Larry bonner. But I only came back... To protect you. Come on, franny. No way, Rex. I already told you I respect you. Well what about Wendy? What about Wendy? Wendy went nuts. What do you mean? She's undergoing psychiatric treatment? No, I mean she dropped me, me, for a pledge. Don't be afraid. Rex, I don't know. This place, it gives me the creeps. Why? They already found the guy who killed everyone. But he's pleading not guilty. I mean he hasn't even been positively identified by the survivors. An ex-con? Come on, what do you think? Besides, don't you think I deserve something a little special for all I've been through? I mean losing my class to a maniac and my girl to a pledge? I guess. Out of sight.
