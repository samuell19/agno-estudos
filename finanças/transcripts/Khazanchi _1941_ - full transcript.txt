You Tube - Video Running Time 02:26:30 You Tube search name - Khazanchi - 1941 The monsoon is all around There are signs of merriment in the eyes of budding flowers Let's get lost in the embrace of... Dear friend let's go to the land where... the ambience of these dark clouds bees don't die over flowers Why should one go where... one is deprived of getting acquainted with the mysteries of love? What do you know about love? Don't play with fire... oh you beauty-crazed men Your face is smudged. Could you oblige? You fell in spite of a long beard (experienced)? Shame! It's a beard, not a brake. Kamal. Speak. What's the matter? Let me get out. Come here. Say something. Help! Get me out! Get me out! Anyone here to help me? Oh. You're back? Where did you go? Why mataji (mother)? What happened to your finger? Why should you be concerned? Softly. Why are you getting angry? First ask her why she went out. Look at her clothes. I didn't go alone. Father, all the class girls went on a Diwali picnic. Is Diwali celebrated outside or at home? There he seeks excuses... while you wander around outside. Who'll get the things for Diwali? You've been out shopping all morning. Yes, but not to buy stuff for Diwali. I went to buy things for myself. What a heated argument? Is all well? Diwali sweets. Diwali has returned Our hearts are alight Let's light each other's lamps with stars They'll twinkle and disperse the darkness in this world Rubbing its eyes, the brightness has awakened Wait friend, let's go to nand (Krishna's) village with a garland of our feelings Let's exchange our inner darkness for brightness Let's go to the banks of river Jamuna... and find happiness in our lives Diwali has come again, dear friend Father's home. Hide. Quickly. What were you doing, beti? It took so long to open the door. I was playing, father. So, you were playing? That's why things are scattered all around. But who were you playing with? I was alone, father. So you did this all alone? Father, don't get annoyed on Diwali. Come in... and give me sweets from this basket. Not from the small basket... but from the bigger one. Two are hiding here. Come out all of you, and come here. You'll all get punished. And you, Asha, more than others. - Give me too. - I will. Just wait. - Close your eyes. - Here you are. Father. Give me too. You too? Here you are. Fine. See you all later. No lamp at the holy Basel plant? I will, immediately, father. - Wait. I'll get the lamp. - Yes. - Has Kamal not come home? - Not yet, father. What happened? Why are your clothes dirty? Nothing father. I just fell off my bicycle. Just fell off?! What if you'd hurt yourself? Kamal, from the day I bought you that bicycle... I've been on tenterhooks. My son... please understand... you and Asha are the lights of my life. If anything happens to either of you... I'll die a living death. Father, everyone rides a bicycle. But you are careless. And it's Diwali. The streets are crowded. There are cars, horse carriages, horses... There's danger of accident. Did you hear that? It's supporting me. Please get him some snacks. - Where are you going? - Babuji wants sweets. Carry on working. - Madhuri. - Coming mother. - Mother what did you bring? - None of your business. I just asked. Didn't you hear? He'd like some food. Please send Makhan. Is it a lot to ask? These modern girls. Completed business concerning Narayan Das. Very profitable. See, it's the... result of my hard work. So, celebrate Diwali. Light a lot of lamps. The light of our house is... You shouldn't have. Where's the servant? - In mother's room. - What're they doing there? Sorting out the innumerable... packages mother bought. Oh. I forgot the flowers. Please fetch them, beti. Bicycle?! Again? Just yesterday you fell off it. Today you are off on it again. Father, I won't fall off everyday. No, my dear. Leave it here, and go by bus. Okay. You have it, beti? Good girl. - Namaste, father. - Namaste. He's never late. - I'm fed up. - Same here. I don't eat to get here in time. Here's your watch. - Is it working now? - Yes. It's a gift from the bank for my honesty and hard work. See? Even the clock's testifying. It's possible... the bank might give you one too... - leading to improved prospects. - Yes, perhaps. Of course, why not! Ramdas! Did you check these entries carefully? - Yes, I did. - You're lying. Check again. Rs 14 are missing. Speak. I was going to tell you... - but didn't have the courage. - What? What urgency... forced you to be dishonest? My son was ill... I needed money for the medicine. You should have told me. People have deposited their money for security... not to fulfill your needs. You get paid for your work. To fulfill your needs... it's dishonest to spend others' money. Do you know the result? Prison. Getting imprisoned even once... would destroy yours and your family's life. Forgive me. Now he wants forgiveness. Get lost. Why was your child unwell? He had pneumonia. Take. Balance the accounts. Come on. See that it doesn't happen again. - Manager sahab is calling you. - Okay, I'm coming. - Model Town. - I don't have change. So? What can I do? Please sit. I'll pay. - Is it 3 annas for Model Town? - Yes. Here. Give her the ticket. And change? We'll try when the bus stops. I'll take back mine, and you take yours. Shaadi Lalji, you'll have to go to Bombay tonight... to fetch some important papers... from The City Bank Ltd. Bombay. - I? - Yes. I can't trust anyone else. And... - these papers too. - Whatever you say. I trust you completely. But you need to be extra cautious here.. God willing it will be so. Don't worry. - So get ready to go. - Alright. - What would you like? - Some chest expanders. Jamnadas please bring some. Anything else? - A shaving kit. - Very well. Did you come to get change or for shopping? Unless we buy something, they won't give change. Here. Do you want a single or a double? Is single better, or... double? I think double is always superior to single. - Don't waste my time? - Why don't you look around? Excuse me. I don't need anything. - Perhaps she's a bit annoyed. - A bit? She's very annoyed. It is justified. You started shopping without asking her wish. The world is theirs now, sahab. Are you doing business or mocking people? Please forgive me for my bad joke. Settle your quarrel among yourselves. Please hurry up. How much is this? This costs... 2 Rupees 12 annas. And this? 9 Rupees 8 anna. Please pack both. Check this new set of Cutex.

I owe you Rs. 10. - Enough, enough. Here you are. When do we meet again? Why? How does it matter? Okay, I'll come on my own. Beta, what's in the bundle? Shhhhh. Softly. Or else mother will hear you. Why? You haven't stolen from her. It's not about stealing. I've bought such a wonderful thing... that if she sees it... she'll snatch it away immediately. You won't get another in any shop in the bazaar. All sold out. Father, bhaiya won't show what he's bought. Look here Kamal. This won't do. Show us what you've bought. And my daughter too. Okay, father. There's a shaving kit... and a chest expander for exercise. So this is that expander thing... one uses to expand ones chest. Please roll my holdall. I'm going to Bombay. You're going to Bombay? Yes. Today. But please stop this business of exercising, while I'm away. Look after home. Beti, what's this? My packet got exchanged. Nanhi, I don't feel like leaving you. But it's the question of my job. Father, your holdall is ready. Yes? Okay, I'm ready too. Don't forget my books father. How can I? I'll write it down. And yes, you must also remember... as soon as your results are out... send me a telegram immediately. What will you bring for me, father? - Whatever you want. - For me... bring bangles for me. And for the size... I should take you along, shouldn't I? You never take me with you, father. Here's a bangle for size. Father, Bombay is so big... I'm afraid you might get lost. I'm not a child like you to get lost. Put the luggage on the horse carriage. Beti, don't worry. I'll be back soon. Water this Tulsi every morning. It was planted by your mother. Poor thing. She looked after it diligently. Okay, father. I'll look after it well. Oh, I'm badly hurt. Are you injured? Get up, I'll take you home. I'm so grateful. - Please be seated - I'd like to take leave now. You must have something. I'll be back. - What's this? - Did you fall somewhere? Doctor (ayurvedic), today was nearly the end. A young man barely saved my life. - How did you come here? - I? To see you. I didn't invite you to see me. But I said I'd come. - Why? - By mistake our packages... got mixed up. Here. And my packet? I'll bring it tomorrow. I don't want the packet. Just go. - Please go. - Is this the way to treat guests? Whose guest? What are you saying? Are you leaving or not? Doctor, I won't go out anymore. If you do, you're responsible. There's still time. Leave. Not before I've had tea. - Who's the tea for? - For babuji (gentleman). Have you gone mad too. Who asked you to bring tea for him? I told him, beta. Why father? What happened? Beti, if he hadn't been there... I would've been run over by a car. Please sit. He's Shaadi Lalji's. son. Do you know him? No, I don't. I think I have... seen you somewhere. Father, are you hurt? He saved me. Mr. Kamal. Have your tea. Madhuri, make tea for him. He's shy. So, you are in college. Yes. She's very intelligent. She comes first in class. Girls are doing very well these days. In academics, in sports... wherever you look... She's an expert in cycling. Is she fond of cycling? Be careful. Don't crash into somebody. Poor person might die. He's right. Her packet got exchanged with some fool's. He took hers and she his. A pampered and spoilt bud... lived in a garden There was talk of her youth... among the stars in the blue sky She was laughing and playing one day... among the colorful flowers She was swinging on a swing of flowering branches Just then the eyes of a bee met hers The eyes spoke and shared many secrets The bud smiled and bloomed into a flower. Then the bee went near And soon snatched away all the color, beauty, and petals Such a sweet voice. She sings well. It's the first time I've heard her sing. She's better than the best singers. Napoleon says... the success of society and country... depends on women. If men sit at home and spin yarn... women will have to progress. You say such funny things, beta. I'm longing to meet this Asha. Radio singers belong to high society. - They don't meet any and everyone. - I will meet her. Okay. Then... - we'll meet there. - What? Okay, I'll take leave. It's getting late. Hello. New Cosmopolitan Hotel. Who? Taravati? Hold, please. Room 13. Telephone. - Welcome. - Yes... I'd like a very clean room. All our rooms are very clean. Your call. So which is my room? Take sahab to Room 14. What? I... come? - I don't want any water problems. - No, you won't have any. I'll be back soon. What's the name of your play today? Innocent victim. Great. He forgot his umbrella. I'm going up... I'll give it to him. Hang it on 14. Excuse me. Is this your umbrella? Yes, it's mine. I must have left it downstairs. You didn't leave it. You forgot it. - Oh. Was it any trouble? - Yes. It's very heavy. What's the matter? ls the porter here? Get in quickly. Who called? Have you been encouraging someone? As long as there's the net of beauty and youth... it will catch some victim. Tara? What's going on? You weren't at the rehearsal's, either. Rehearsal? What rehearsal? Oh, lnnocent Victim's? Innocent Victim. Please order your meal. May God bless you. I'll order after my bath. I'll wait here. No, You go. I'll call you later. - Okay, may God... - Bless you. Now go. Such food kills one's appetite. Bhaiya, you talk as if... we have 4/5 servants. Get married to the girl in the photo in your pocket. She'll cook for you. Oh Asha, I never told you. I went to her house. Oh! You've started visiting her? You misunderstand. There's a Lala Durgadas... I saved from getting run over. But what's that to do with Madhuri? He's Madhuri's father. He took me home. Then you must have met Madhuri and her mother. - Are you engaged? - Engaged? She's in love with you. She heard your song on the radio... and wants to meet you. You should have brought her. Why should I? She'll come herself. She said, I will... meet Asha. Is she coming? She said so. That's why I didn't tell her... you're my sister. Do you work in a bank? I'm the treasurer of a bank in Lahore. I've come here for an important job. So, you're here for the first time. But you, here... Father's coming next week. I'm waiting for him. In this big city... - you live alone? - Yes, I do. But, till father comes... I'll visit you now and then, for company. You don't mind? Err... Nooo... no reason to mind. And you are new here. It won't be easy to find the bank. - I'll come with you. - No, no. Don't trouble yourself. I'll find it. No trouble. I'll be happy to do it. Thank you. I'll take leave now. I'll come again. I'm no Goddess that you come like a devotee. But you have such a melodious voice. Immediately after your song... I wanted to meet you. I've seen you somewhere. Can't remember where. Anyway, what can I do for you? Please don't bother. No trouble. I'll bring tea. No, please sit. Are you alone? Father's gone to Bombay, and brother to college. I'll get tea, then we'll chat. - You here too? - Why do you get so nervous on seeing me? Why are you pestering me? Is it me, or... you. I don't know. It's difficult to get rid of you. You're everywhere. The Earth is round. That's why we keep meeting. Now leave without a word. - Otherwise? - Otherwise? At home I had to call my servants. Here I'll have to call the police. That would be more humiliating. - Who are you? - I've come with her. - Oh. Please sit. - No, no. - He didn't come with me. - Don't worry. Why are you harassing me in another's home. It's your home too. Now I'm your guest. Now you can't push me out. Look here Mr. Kamal. You're always troubling me. So you know my brother? Now I get it bhaiya. She's the Madhuri you talk about. So you brother and sister were laughing at me? What've you been telling about me? Have you seen? Here take this. Bhaiya she's really pretty and well mannered. I'm going now. No, I won't let you. Why are you looking at each other like this? Please sit. Bhaiya... you said... she listens to you? Ask her to sit down. I'll get another cup. You get annoyed easily. When did I have this taken? I fell that way by chance. But such a chance is never repeated. Anyway, you can't keep it. What should I do? I'll take it. Okay, at least now be seated and have tea. The cursed darkness has left... and cool moonlight has arrived And in a moon-platter... it has brought pearls of hope The eye that cried tears... in that eye laughs my beloved The nights that were devoid of all pleasure... are like that no more The cursed darkness has left... and cool moonlight has arrived My daughter's very happy today. Yes, father. I'm very happy today. - What is it, beti? - The girl singing on the radio that day... whose song you liked so much? Do you know who she is? No, I don't, but... she sang very well. If you like her singing so much... - shall we call her here? - Why'd she come here? Do you know her? I'm so happy because I've met her. Do you know who she is? Yes, who? He who... Mr. Kamal. He came the other day. She's his younger sister. Shaadi Lal's daughter? A very sweet girl, father. Did she welcome you? Not just welcomed, they really honored me. They? There were others there? You know her brother... Mr. Kamal? - He was there too. - Mr. Kamal? Sweet boy. Even his father's a nice man. I'm very happy to have met him. Who? That... Asha, father. The photo-lady came here on her own. What're you saying? Nothing wrong. Bhaiya, such an intelligent... and pretty and clever girl. Must be a graduate. She looks better educated than you. Who? Who are you talking about? Oh, you innocent. I'm talking about Madhuri. - My bhabi (sis-in-law). - Bhabi? What bhabi? But bhaiya, will she like our hut? She'd want a modern mansion. A luxurious one. Who's asking her to come here. Of course you don't like her at all. That's why you accompanied her home. - I'll write to father. - What will you write? Just this, that it's bhaiya's wedding... come immediately. Get me a bhabi, bhaiya lndulge me, bhaiya I'll get her a teeka (piece of jewelry for the forehead) made out of sun earrings with the moon... embroider the stars on her blouse Her beauty will be enhanced I'll steal color from the flowers... and the beauty of the buds... to decorate... and give good wishes Get me a bhabi, bhaiya - Have you finished work? - Yes. I'll take my leave now. - You'll find your way back to the hotel? - Yes, I will. Thanks. - Okay. I'll come in the evening. - In the evening? - We'll go out. - But listen... I have something very important this evening. You can do it tomorrow. - You be ready. - But... - Yes, be ready. But listen... Your eyes are cups of wine I won't speak with you - Speak. - No. - Speak. - No. Leave the others, and talk to me, remove your veil I won't remove my veil or speak with you I'll bring it. Taravati phoned. - She's coming. - Now? - You told her I'm here? - Yes. - May God bl... - Stupid man... may god bless you... may god bless you. Listen. If Taravati comes... tell her I'm at the bank. - Understood? - Yes. May God bless you. I'm on time. Yes, yyyou... are on time. I got delayed. So took a taxi. - Come on. - But I have to go upstairs. - Come on. Let's go. - Innocent victim. - May God... bless you. The eyes have a strange ritual They shoot arrows, but the eyes don't see them They leave one pair and enter the other From the eyes it settles in the heart One arrow lights a fire... the other puts the fire out... whether it's day or night Doesn't know the smile of buds, nor consider the peace of the bees Playfully it snatches away your mind... like the pearl from its shell The magic wind blows... and snatches away the flame from a weak lamp They shoot arrows but the eyes don't see them What are you doing? With one arrow... light a fire. - What's this? - Another arrow puts the fire out. Who's he? Mr. Ramesh. My father's business partner. He's so lucky. How? The one who can visit Madhuri's home is lucky. Don't be funny. - But why are you nervous? - Not really, but... - he carries tales home. - What will he tell? He'll tell mother, masi (aunt) see... Madhuri and a boy... were chatting in a garden. Masiji. I hope I'm not left dressed as a bridegroom... while Kamal takes the bride. What happened? Take a look in the garden She's flirting with Kamal. But that's true. Aren't you with me, here? He'll spice up this information. What would that be? He'll say... Madhuri and... Kamal... You don't understand. Why don't you explain? Let it be. Should I explain it to you? I don't like this teasing. Madhuri, the eyes speak when the mouth doesn't. What do they say? You want to know? You are in... No, you won't understand. You are going to be in disgrace. - What happened? - What happened? Go and see. She's sitting with Kamal in the garden. So what? Kamal is a good boy. You are never serious. Speak frankly that you both think alike. So what if I'm her step mother? I think of her welfare. Can I not speak? I'm tired of your talk. Please go now. Why beta, what is it? What did you ask me? Has Mr. Kamal left? He's gone. Father, I want to tell you something. Yes, speak beti. You know Kamal, father... I and Kamal... Speak. Don't feel shy. Nothing, father. We were sitting in the garden. Did something come up in the conversation? We talked a lot, father. - And.. - So what was your reply? I said... What reply, father? Okay, okay. Tell me all about it. Nothing father. He... he... he thinks you're great. Leave this beti. Put on another one. No father. This is a nice flower. I love the smell. - Oh it's dark and... - Be quiet. Someone will hear you. Oh god. You... What are you doing? What're you doing? First give me a little sharbat (a drink). I knew, like death... your aim is precise. But why are you here at this time? To help you. But it's a case of hard work and no result. So what, we'll share whatever it is. But what's this? Nothing. Stay away. Wait. A woman wearing bangles may be a threat to man... but can't frighten him at gunpoint. Don't play with death. It seems, wealth... has influenced your eyes and brain... both. Leave. What have you done? Open the door. - Murder! Murder! - In our hotel? The accused, Mr. Kamal... son of Lala Shadilal, treasurer... has committed a serious crime... is presented to the court. The serious crime is... he goes to meet the beautiful girl... Madhuri, everyday. Your honor, this is incorrect... - and a lie. - Quiet. Don't interrupt. Respected judge sahab, this Mr. Kamal... the treasurer's son, etc. etc... has been arrested because... he didn't take his father's... and also his compassionate... very beloved, and... sweet sister... Asha devi's permission. Respected judge, I request... that Miss Asha devi doesn't have... any compassion for her brother. Who asked you to speak? Sit down. Excuse me barrister sahab. Very respectfully I request... the permission to say... - a few words. - Okay. You're allowed. Speak. I request sincerely... to take off these clothes. They're on rent. Where are you going, fake barrister sahab? Come back, and leave the clothes here. But listen, bhaiya. Will you be able to argue your case like this in court? What do you think? You can hardly speak in front of Madhuri. - How'll you speak in court? - I may not speak much... but in court... I'll rescue many innocent people from death. Really? My brother's become very talented. - Whose letter? - Father's. - It's from Bombay. - When will he return? In a couple of days. - What else has he written? - He has asked... - about the health. - Whose health? Madhuri's. Bhabhiji's. Don't be crazy. Father's written... keep Asha entertained. She shouldn't feel sad. Is this how you entertain? If you annoy me... I'll go out. To go out... don't look for excuses. Say clearly... you want to see bhabi. Nonsense. I'll write to father. You stay out a lot. And I get lonely and sad at home. Father will bring books for us. And bangles for me. Bangles for me I'm going to get colorful bangles They should look green like the... monsoon vegetation And yellow like... the mustard flowers They should glisten on my wrist like the stars in the sky Or like the glow worms in the dark night... swinging from branch to branch I'm going to get colorful bangles Bangles for me Very good. Is this Shadilal's house? Yes, but... he isn't here. - What's the matter? - I have a search warrant. - A search warrant? - What's that, bhaiya? Nothing? You go inside. Do you believe now? It's very surprising. Murder! That too of an actress! Didn't expect this from Shadilalji. It's the saints who hide their colorful life. Very cruel. The family... - will be destroyed. - That's what I'm saying. The children will be effected. What happened, Ramesh? No, sit down. Nothing new. Just that Kamal's father... Shadilal... murdered an actress in Bombay. - Who said that? - See this. - It's impossible. - Read it yourself. Why would you believe? - Very unfortunate. - When the father is like this... what about the son? Do you still want Madhuri to marry... Kamal? Whether you get her married to Kamal, or... Whatever you wish. I don't want to repeat. I only came to tell you this. Good you told us. We've been saved. Imagine getting her married to a murderer's son. - We would've been destroyed. - The world is very bad. When people see her meeting Kamal... what'll they say? I understand, but what to do? If you don't know, take help. So, tell me. Get Madhuri... married to him. All problems solved. What happened, bhaiya? Now what? Kamal, this is impossible. This incident has destroyed all my hopes. Don't lose hope, Kamal. Your father's innocent. He cannot be accused. Don't cry Asha, The world accuses our father... but we'll trust in God. What the sorrow and sadness has colored... it's the sad world's sad... picture That which you enjoyed in your imagination... it is perhaps the interpretation of that dream What should we do? As long as... you don't get her married, even if it's Ramesh... she'll remain like this. I'll stop him from coming here. You are right. You're leaving me? I'm protecting you from disgrace. No... you're taking away my happiness. Your happiness is in... marrying Ramesh... and obeying your parents. You want to hand me to Ramesh? No. But I don't want... to marry you and have the world pointing fingers at you. I've heard you. You aren't concerned about me. But you have to think of your father's respect. - Forget me. - Kamal! In spite of doing this there's no patience... the direction taken leads you far away Years pass away The eyes yearn The memories are painful. Oh destiny The eyes will feast on the lanes of the land... and bring him to his destination But time! Those to whom he gifted flowers... are throwing stones at him What happened, Asha? Bhaiya, I'm feeling afraid. Don't worry. Please sleep. What was this noise, bhaiya? Some children were tormenting a beggar. Father used to say... the poor should be fed. Feed him. Alright. Go to sleep. Take, baba. Who should one tell, what all should one judge? The colors the world shows one... in time... it rains blood They then cry and wail over their destiny From next Friday... only 17 days are left. Why the hurry, panditji (priest). Look for a date in 4 or 5 months. The right day. Okay. Madhuri must have felt very sad. She hasn't come to me for the last 4/5 days. You have a heart of wax. Whatever you did... it was for her good. - Understood? - Oh, my foot! Just a slight touch and you scream? Here you are. July, August... 6th September is a good day. Your company has come from Bombay? Yes, for a few days. What new play have you brought for Lahore? On the occasion of Diwali... our best play... Omar Khayyam. Omar Khayyam, beautiful wine server... and a glass of wine. Yes, yes. Sahab... come and visit us. I will. And... we'll have a chat. The days for drinking are here. Carry on drinking The days to live have come, live on It has intoxication, drown in it It has color, and comfort Don't feel shy, just carry on drinking It dwells in a house of glass It suits every belief So why delay? Carry on drinking It will drive away from everyone... and force you to live Drink as much as you can And, how beautifully the role was enacted. Sahab! You haven't seen anything yet. She has that charisma... which leaves humans stunned. Then why don't you... show me that charisma. My hands are tied because of lack of money. I would've presented it in high class Hindi... and create sensation all over India. I'm there to help with money. How much do you want? For the props... a lot. But I'll manage with Rs 2000. That's all? Only Rs 2000? Today... is Diwali? Then why... didn't you tell me? You're ill. What should I tell you? No, bhaiya. We will also light lamps. And on the holy basel... it's necessary to light one. Asha, stay in bed for now. When you're well we'll celebrate. - Get me some crackers. - Okay, I'll bring some. But you mustn't get up. Here there used to be the light of happiness Now there looms darkness... and with time the destruction... of the wishes While the lamp burns the wounds of the heart Asha, you got up to light the lamp? Yes brother, but... I couldn't light it. - I fell down. - Fell down? But there's a lighted lamp there. - You must've lighted it. - Not I. I've just returned. Then... who... lifted me up? Who lifted you? No, no, Asha. You imagined... Here. Firecrackers. Here. Madhuri's letter, no? May god make her my sis-in-law. - Brother, is everything okay? - Hardly. Madhuri's getting married. With Ramesh. But she loved you so much. - What else? - She writes... 'Save me from this wedding.' - Take her somewhere with me. - She's right. Why don't you? Listen, Asha. You know... to earn a good name... I'm working so hard. That's why. The stain of our father's crime... has to be washed away. And so we live in poverty... to pay back money to the bank... the theft of which is blamed on father. Bhaiya, when did father do that? - He's innocent. - Innocent. If he's innocent, he should come forward... and clear his name. Asha, our father... destroyed our world of happiness. Because of him I left Madhuri. And your engagement... is impossible in any decent family. Don't bother about me. Save Madhuri. - She must be very sad. - How can I elope with her? Father became a murderer and a thief. Now his son too, a thief? Elope with a decent girl? What a family achievement! My son is speaking the truth, God. I'm innocent. Why don't I face the world... and give proof of my innocence? I'm a coward, God. I didn't trust you. Instead of facing the world... and proving my innocence... I tried to hide. I made my children's life unhappy. Tomorrow I'll go to the bank manager... and tell him I'm innocent. I've been framed. God, forgive me. And give me strength. Great. Are you worshipping? You want to steal? Get lost! Run. You priest. Oh heart, cry softly Don't lose the direction of your pining Don't tell the world what is in your heart Whatever passes, tell your heart The person dwelling there will hear... all the crying of the heart The fear caused by the sorrow... of separation... will make you tell the world about it But in your path of any hope, oh foolish one... don't sow any thorns Oh heart, cry softly - Namaste Lalaji. - Namasteji. I'm not satisfied with your new treasurer. Your old treasurer... Lala Shadilalji was a good man. Oh yes, he was a very good man. That's why he put us in difficulty. Don't take his name. Please come in. - How long will it take? - Only 10 minutes. What's the time? Satisfied? Do you lack clothes that you're buying more? Not for me. For your beloved daughter's wedding. Sure! Sure! Buy! Tell him... - to get even better material. - And you... phone Govind Ram Jauhri about the jewelry. This saree was made in England. Seth sahab, you forgot your promise to get me a saree. Saree? Not just sarees, I'll get you... cars, mansions... money and jewelry, and other such things. For you I'm ready to have my head cut off. Come Prakash. What's the matter? Did you see this, Seth sahab? The manager has started cheating us too. What check is this? I've always tried to shield him... and this is what I get in return. - Bad check. - Why are you complaining to me? Speak to him. I've already paid him. No, I'm not saying anything to you. But just notice how cunning he is. When was he ever simple... to have become cunning now. Fraud and cheating is his job. But his cheating and fraud won't work on me, Sethji. I'll ask him right now. Here's your check. It bounced. It's the first time you gave me my share. That too with deceit? There's a limit to one's patience, manager sahab. Do you know the dangers we have to face? When you're asked something... you give excuses. Don't always give hope. You haven't paid anything from Bombay to Lahore. - What did I get in this trip? - I don't care... but Ramesh's Rs 1500 check... will not be only yours. You forget Prakash... I helped you when... you were penniless. You forget, manager sahab... I know all your secrets. If I tell them... you'll be hung right now. Quiet! I won't! I'll shout out... you're a killer, a murderer. You're a dacoit. You killed Tara. You robbed poor Khazanchi. And now... you're cheating Ramesh. - You've killed him? - Yes. Anyone who messes with me... deserves this. What have you done? What will you do now? You'll hang. Run away. And you'll escape unscathed? I'll see who hangs. You or me? Who are you? What're you doing here at this time? Phone the police. Tell them we've caught the murderer. Understood? What a brilliant idea. See he doesn't run away. Trilok. Here's another criminal. Are you aware? I'm known as Chattar Sen. Yes, because of whom the innocent treasurer becomes guilty. Catch him Trilok. It isn't easy to unearth my secrets. I heard a gunshot in the next room. When I entered the room... the murderer had killed my assistant... and was trying to run away. - Then? - Without a thought of my safety... we caught the murderer. There was my assistant's corpse... and here, the killer. Handcuff him. Father would've been happy with your success. Certainly, Asha. But luck is not on our side. Okay. Don't tire yourself. You've just recovered. You shouldn't have a relapse. Alright bhaiya. I'll pray to holy basel... that you succeed in this case... like you did in the earlier cases. Your honor. My friend has... declared this as strange... that a hungry naked old man... takes out a revolver from his rags. It's truly a strange thing... This person who doesn't have clothes to wear... no food to eat... is supposed to possess a revolver. But don't forget... this man who possessed a revolver... was actually arrested when... the suspect's hands... were stealing a watch from a man's pocket. You see... he's a person... who, to deceive the world... with his beard and his age... hides a criminal's hard heart... and an evil soul. Can you still not guess... why he possessed a revolver? Are you still doubtful? The watch thief... might have stolen the watch earlier? If there was any chance of... his being even a bit honest... if in his dark heart... there was any ray of decency... then before pressing the trigger... his hands would have stopped... at the thought of taking the victim's life. That his children... and dependents would become helpless... because they depended on him. But this hard, cruel... loser, never knew... the responsibilities of a family. Within the four walls of the house... there are lovely people, breathing. He has no one... no children... no love in his heart... - no place for another's pain. - No. no. Don't say that. He's escaping! Catch him! Are there any other witnesses? Your honor. Just one more. Alright. Please, present him. This is cruel. You're forcing me. I have no connection with this. - Why bring me here? - Quiet! Why'd you bring me here? Your honor, this is Mr. Ramesh. He'd refused the summons. After that... a warrant for his arrest was issued. Repeat: 'ln the name of God... I promise to speak the truth.' In the name of God... I promise to speak the truth. Mr. Ramesh, do you recall giving this check? Yes, but... No, no. I didn't kill anyone. I didn't. I'm innocent. He's guilty. There he is. He's guilty. He pulled the trigger. Let me go. Let me go. Arrest him. - Let me go. I'm innocent. - Silence! Do you know the accused? - No. - Did you ever see him before? - Speak up. - No, I didn't. Nor when the crime took place? No. So your honor... no more questions. I want to ask a couple of questions. Please do, but quickly. I have to attend my wedding. Right now. Weddings aren't up for auction. In your absence no one's going to bid... for your bride and win. Silence. Tell me... when the police... arrested the accused... why couldn't you see him? Because I was in the adjoining room. The quarrel between the manager and his business partner... could be heard in that room. I heard the gunshot there. And then? Manager came out of the room panting. Did you see the revolver in his hands? Did you see the gun being fired? You only heard the voices from your room? And after hearing those voices... you came to the conclusion... the manager had killed his business partner. - Yes. - One last question. Why did you give this check to the manager? Why? Check? Listen sahab. The... manager... he... he... I mean, I... enjoy watching dance and drama. - And... - Yes, yes? Speak. Don't hesitate. Why give the check? I... I mean... how can I tell all? And the secret is such... it might be important for your future father-in-law. But you should know... until the court adjourns... you'll have to stay here. Your honor, fear god at least. Is this justified? Today's my wedding day. What will my father-in-law say? What will my poor bride do? She is faced with this problem. Oh your honor, oh lawyer sahab... oh guardji, what cruelty is this? Think of my bitterly crying bride. Oh God, preserve my honor. Catch him! He's running away with my bicycle. Give me my bicycle. The police, the lawyers... the court, everyone has conjectured. Who's he, where did he come from? What does he do? But he couldn't tell us. Could he utter any word... to answer any question? No. Is this such a difficult riddle? Anyone can... guess his past life... a story of murder and crime. He's fooling us even now. Like a wolf... hiding in sheep's clothing. Your honor, I request... that you don't overlook the fact that... the accused is a thief... murderer, and a cruel man. He should be declared guilty... and punished. That's all, your honor. The case has been discussed. I hope... you all will study it... and legally... arrive at a fair ruling. Your honor... before making any decision... hear the truth. - Who are you? - Your honor... I'm a bank clerk. I want to give some important information. It's against court rules to do that. Your honor, maybe... it is so, but... a few moments... of the court are not more important than a life. Okay. What new info do you have... about this case? Your honor, he's not the murderer. He is! I was there. In front of me he... shot his colleague only... because he'd... already murdered a woman in Bombay. And his colleague... was threatening to disclose it. Your honor... let me go now. It's my wedding. Silence. It's late. Why has the groom's party not arrived yet? Wonder what happened. I'll go and see. Your honor, this watch is evidence. This watch. Mr. Kamal... Don't you recognize it? It's your father... Shadilalji's. I'm the bank's manager. This watch was given to Shadilal... for his honesty, by me. But, Kamal's father, Shadilal... was a dishonest man. He cheated the bank... murdered a woman... - and escaped. - No, no. This is untrue. It is false. Shadilal is neither crooked... nor dishonest. This doesn't throw any light on this case. It does, your honor. Because the bank's treasurer... was accused of embezzlement. The one who was always honest... is being hunted by the law. I am Kamal's innocent... father, Shadilal. I was silent only because... I wanted my silence to be Kamal's success. A father who was of no use to his children... could not have missed this opportunity. The noose round my neck... put by my son's own hands. Just to see Kamal smile at least once... a shamed father would've died happily. But even before listening to the court's ruling... I found out... that an innocent person's sin... had already become immortal. The charge on the innocent... will remain after his death. His shadow... will never leave his children. This fear... took away the peace that comes with death. I ask for a death sentence. Death, earned by Kamal. And from the world, just one thing. After an innocent's death... don't remind his children... that their father was a criminal. Really? No, no. Impossible. What happened? Did Ramesh phone? Don't worry. I have to go. Then go. Hurry up. Father. I agree with the members of the jury. I order... the release of the accused Shadilal. And Chatrasen accused of murdering Tara... and Ramesh and Chatrasen... accused of murdering in this case... under article 6:302... to be sued. - What about your wedding? - Stripped in public! - My son. - Please forgive me. - I... - That was your duty. I was really happy... that in the court... you stood steadfast in your duty. Have you seen Mr. Kamal? Yes. He went this way. My little daughter. You are really very generous. It's your greatness Manager sahab. Kamal, hurry up. The people of the groom's party are waiting for you. It's the wedding day. Kamal? Your wedding? Your father's lucky. Durgadasji... Wedding's not an auction. No one's going to bid for your bride. Come on son, Kamal. - Is Ramesh here? - Yes. You get Madhuri. Congratulations, Ramesh. My wishes are fulfilled. Here. Take care of your Madhuri. The monsoon is in the air In the eyes of the flowering buds... are signs of merriment
