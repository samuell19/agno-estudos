What else is there to do anyway? - What are we gonna do there? - Contemplate. - Oh, you think so. - [Paul Voiceover] Shouldda said the Beach Bar. Belmore Lounge maybe. Barbara, I wanna kiss you very much. I would definitely like to. - [Barbara Voiceover] I hope nobody thinks I'm going with him. Oh, god, it's just one date. - [Paul Voiceover] You can't come out and say it. A simple declarative sentence. You just can't say it. - [Barbara Voiceover] What if he wants to kiss me goodnight? Hmmm? (waves rolling and splashing) - I love the sea. So simple. Listen, it really is beautiful. - Yeah, it is. Most people don't know how to appreciate it though. - You must know some poetry about the sea. - Why me? - [Barbara] Come on. - Ah, water water everywhere and not a drop to drink. - Come on. - "Far and few, far and few, "Are the lands where the Jumblies live; "Their heads are green, and their hands are blue, "And they sailed to sea in a Sieve. "And their friends said, who saw them go, "Oh, you'll be drowned you know, "For the sea is vast and the voyage long "And happen what may it is extremely wrong "In a sieve to sail so far." - It is so vast. Don't you like it? - Yeah, I do. You wanna swim in it? - You know, Christine said you were deep. Deep, can you believe it? - She said I was deep? - [Barbara] Yeah. - What else did she say? - Mmmm, nothing. - Come on, let's swim in it. The sea. - Well, I don't have a suit on. - Me either. Who needs clothes anyway? I've got nothing to hide. - Hey, you must be kidding. Oh, I don't believe it. They'll never believe it. Hey, hey, oh. Hey, I'm not looking at you. - [Paul] Yeah, I can see that. Come on, the water looks great. - Oh, you're kidding. Hey, oh. (waves rolling and splashing) - Do you have a key? Not that I wouldn't want to meet your mother. - She leaves it open. - Look, I'm sorry you can't go to that play Tuesday. - Ask Christine to go. She'd like that sort of thing. - Come on, she doesn't even know me really. - Say, did Chris say anything else I should know? - Chris? - Barbara? When did she say I was deep? - Oh, nevermind. - Night. I wish he would take me to bed. Take me, take me. Paul is deep. He's deep, so deep. (car horn blares) The uglies. I've got the uglies. (gas pump dings) Is that a pistol in your pocket or are ya just pleased to see me? - Genius, genius. (Paul laughs) Alright, come on. How come your pants are off, really? - You're goin' out with Barbara Tuesday, aren't ya? How'd you both like to double with me? Go to a play in the city. - Come on, how come? - Alright, I went swimming. - Bare ass? - Yeah. - She didn't go in like that. - Are you kidding? She was scared out of her mind. She didn't even look. - [Steve] You really went in bare ass? - How 'bout Tuesday night? - [Steve] Fantastic. Yeah, okay. Who you gonna take? - Oh, I dunno. Someone who can appreciate my sterling qualities. - Chris? Russell'd break your neck. (radio chattering) - How's Russ? - How was your date? - Would you go out with him? (typewriter clicking) (typewriter dings) (typewriter clicking) - What crap. (seagull crying) (dramatic string music) (radio chattering) - They pitch to him, that's the game. Hey, watch it, fella. - Sorry, Russ. - Well, watch it that's all, Steve. - You alright? Boy, you went in a little fast. (radio chattering) - I didn't know Steve was such a good friend of his. Since when? - A while, I think. - Just watch it, that's all. - Is he kidding? - What, what is it? - What's the matter? - I dunno. - What don't ya know, wiseguy? Thought your kind was supposed to know everything? - What kind? What are ya talking about? - Come on, Russ, leave him alone. - Steve, he gave me the finger. - Would you get your lousy hands off. - Chris, come over here. - [Christine] Leave him alone, Russ, huh. - Apologize to her. - Who? - The lady. - I'm sorry, lady. - Hey. Alright, you better stay outta my way. - Yes sir. - You want some more? - No sir, sorry sir. - [Christine] Let's go, that's enough. - See ya, Steve. - [Christine] Bye. - [Paul Voiceover] What do you want, you dumb overgrown gorilla? Why don't you develop that muscle between your ears. Stupid moron, mesomorph, delta minus. You dumb animal. I could sink that screwdriver into your stomach and rip your guts open. Yeah, but I'd get the electric chair if I did. You lucky slob. - [Christine Voiceover] Paul, you know so much about non-violence, Gandhi and Christ, Martin Luther King. Oh, how I love you. How I wanna talk with you. To tell you how we're the only two who really understand. - [Paul Voiceover] Yes, oh yes, yes. - [Steve] He's too sensitive for his own good. - He's just dumb. Why are there so many good-looking bastards like him who are so dumb? It's not fair. - Who said the world was fair? - [Paul] Christine Larson. - Who? - [Paul] Christine Larson. - I haven't heard her name before, have I? - Yes. - [Mother] When? - Just now, twice. - Don't be sarcastic with your mother. - She's a cheerleader, Mom. You know, I'm making a big move up. I mean, it's a self-willed, existential, unexpected, cosmic leap, Ma. - Don't be sarcastic with your mother. - There's some watermelon in the refrigerator. - Where's the drama section? - It's on the chair. - Would you mind getting it for your father, Paul? - Sure. Say, Dad, could I use mom's car tomorrow night? - You're not using the car tomorrow, are you dear? - What would I need it for? - You may use it then. - Thanks. - [Christine] Hello? - [Paul] Hello, this is Paul Green calling. May I please speak to Christine? - [Christine] It's me. - [Paul] Oh, hi. Well this is Paul Green calling. - [Christine] Hello. - [Paul] How are you? - [Christine] Fine. How are you? - [Paul] Oh fine. Say, Chris, would you like to go to a play in the city tomorrow night? Romeo and Juliet. - [Christine] Paul, I'm sorry about what happened on the beach. - [Paul] Nevermind. - [Christine] No, I really am. - [Paul] Look, what about Romeo and Juliet? - [Christine] Well what about them? - [Paul] The play, tomorrow night? - [Christine] Okay, I'd like to go with you. - [Paul] Really? - [Christine] Yeah. - [Paul] Great. - [Christine] We won't get back too late, will we? - [Paul] Oh no, no, not too late. I'll pick you up at 6:45. - [Christine] Great. - [Paul] Eat first. - [Christine] What? - [Paul] Eat first. We wont' have time to eat before the show. - [Christine] (laughs) That's okay. - [Paul] Great, see you then. - [Christine] Goodbye, Paul. - [Paul] Goodnight, Christine. (electric shaver buzzing) (toothbrush buzzing) (Waterpik buzzing) - You look ravishing, Christine. Christine, you look wonderful. Chris, you look great. Great, Christine, you look great. That's it. Great, Christine, you look great. Don't worry, Mrs. Larsen, we'll drive carefully. Good night. Don't worry, we will. You know you really surprised me you're being able to make it tonight. - It took some arranging. - Yeah, I'll bet. - One more year and we're out of this place. - Oh, I've gotta pick them up. - Pick up who? - Steve and Barbara. We're doubling. - Doubling? (radio chattering) (cars honking) - I dunno, Russ is cool. - Well, what do you mean? - I don't know, he's it, isn't he. Even if I don't know what it means. Look, I'm detached aren't I? - That's not what it really means. - All of you are cool, right? - Just you against the world? Rich people are cool. Ugly people aren't so cool. - You know, I once wanted to write a movie about ugly girls. I mean, how miserable they must be. - Not anymore. I mean, with all the makeup and clothes you get, there's no need for that. - I don't think so. I mean, what about Alice the Ass? - Well, I think Russ is really cool. - He's too dumb. - No he's not, Paul. There's a lot more to human beings than you suspect. - Yeah, yeah, well sure. I've got a lot to learn. I'm really very ignorant. Like Socrates. - Turn up the radio. - No, I think this is important, Steve. - Turn it up. - Hey, we're coming to the toll. You want them to think we're some underage kids driving illegally? Better get some classical music, Chris, 1560. - I know. - Most people don't, Chris. - [Steve] How come your father let you drive into the city? - He likes me. Do you have 50 cents for the toll? - [Steve] Here. - Kennedy. (dramatic orchestral music) - Hey. Hey, it's 25. You gave me 50 cents, it's only 25. - Say, could I have the half dollar back, please? I have a quarter right here. Thanks a lot.

We better go right home. - [Steve] Locked it in the car. - [Barbara] Can you believe it? - [Steve] Too cool. - How you feeling? - Alright. - How come you spend so much time with him? - Car, boat. No, he's alright. - Well, he's interesting. - Do you think so? - Yeah. - You really think so? - Yeah. - I guess he is kind of. - [Paul] Hey. - In a little trouble, kid? - A little. - You're lucky you got a convertible. No center post. - Where'd you guys learn how to do that? - We do it a couple of times a week. - Well, that's a relief. Thanks a lot. - Not at all, drive carefully now. - [Christine] You won't make it. - [Paul] Sorry, I thought I could. - [Steve] You're lucky they didn't ask you for your license. - [Christine] We were all lucky. - [Paul] No cars on the road and we're here like jerks waiting for a traffic light to go blip. - [Steve] It won't kill you to obey the law. - [Paul] Who makes the law? Cops can break into cars. Soldiers are allowed to kill civilians. It's all legal. - [Christine] How can you say that? - [Paul] It's not so hard. Anyway, you know I didn't mean anything against those cops in particular. - [Christine] You mean negros? - [Steve] You don't see many in Belmore. - [Paul] Yeah, that's true. - [Christine] Let's forget it. The light's green, Paul. - [Paul] Oh, good. (girls gasp) - [Paul] I know how unpredictable stomachs can be. - [Christine] Forget it, Paul. I'll be alright. - [Paul] Look, do you have any Pepto Bismol maybe? - [Christine] Maybe, I'll take something. - I hope you feel better. - I'm sorry, Paul. - It's okay. - Well, am I gonna see you again soon? - Sure, sure. Well, I'll call ya. - We'll talk. - Take your time, guys. - I'll see you at the beach tomorrow. - Good. - We've got football practice tomorrow. - Huh, after that. - We've gotta go around the side. (radio chattering) Do you think Paul's deep? - Sure. (radio chattering) - Do you really think he's deep? - Yeah, yeah. A regular Grand Canyon. - Goodnight. - [Steve] Let's get out of these clothes and get a drink, huh. (swanky rock music) Seven and seven. - [Paul] The same. (bar patrons chattering) - Ah, ah, ah. - Take 'em both. - Thanks. - Hey, Steve. What are you doing here? Stevie bring ya? - Steve, I gotta get back. Do you want a lift? - No thanks, I think I'll hang around a while. - So long, Chris. - Bye, Paul. - Hey, you wanna dance or what? - No thanks, I don't feel like it. - Beauty. (upbeat rock music) (fast-paced instrumental music) - Now on the snap, you come off the line fast and you pop 'em, really pop 'em. That just about winds up what I have to say. Just remember the scrimmage with Amityville is just around the corner. And we officially start practice the day school opens. Just remember these preseason practices are because you want them, because you've got the desire to win. Now, I know some of you guys have been breaking the training rules. Just remember, it'll catch up with you when we really get going. Now, you've got what it takes. Just remember, you pull in a thoroughbred, he gives you all he's got. You pull in a jackass and he kicks. - Christ, that was in Reader's Digest. I think the next one's gonna be when the going gets tough, the tough get going. - Green, hey Green, sit up. You got something to say, say it all of us. To most of us, football means something. Okay, guys, I want you to get out there and really work. Now, huddle around here, come on. Just remember guys, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. Let's go. (players cheer) - [Paul Voiceover] Here we are folks, at the world championship of high school football. It's the Chiefs of Belmore versus the Orange Devils of Oceanside. The Oceanside team has a balanced T-formation attack, while the Chiefs will be counting on their super-sensational, triple-threat, singlewing back, Paul Green. A roar from the crowd. This is an NBC Cavalcade of Sports presentation, folks. And now back to the game, folks. Well, we're in on the closing minutes in one of the greatest contests I've ever seen. Oceanside 13 on runs by McGovern and O'Connor. Belmore scoreless as Green was out with an injury early in the game. Wait a second. Green is up off the stretcher. He's just smashed through the Oceanside line. There must be three men hanging on his back. He's dragging all of them with him to the 30, the 25, the 20. What desire. He's still going. What determination. To the 10, to the five. He's over, wild cheering. Now the kick, the snap. Green kicks, up, over, it's good. Oceanside 13, Belmore seven. Here's the kick. Wait a minute, it's an onside kick. It's dribbling down the field, only 20 seconds left in the game, this is going to be the last play. McGovern of Oceanside got it. He's at the 40, the 45, the 50. No, no, Green of Belmore wrestled the ball from McGovern. Green, a roar from the crowd. Green is racing toward the goal. It looks like an upset victory for Green, um Belmore. He's across the midfield stripe. The 40, the 30, the 20. - Paul. Paul. Hey, toad. Hey, what are ya daydreaming about? Come on. - Let's go, come on. Hey Green, come on over. Kick one with a little pressure. - When you call in a jackass, he kicks. (whistle blasts) - [Coach] Come on, Russ. Look smart, Russ. - [Russ] On three, on three, let's go. Signal's on. Blue, one, two, three, four. (players yelling and grunting) - Time, coach. Hey, time, hey coach, time. - Green, you okay? You okay, Green? Here, put this on your nose. Alright, make room. Don't stand around. Make room. Key on the ball, not the man. On the ball. That tie with Bethpage couldda been a win. (Russ mumbling) - Yeah. - Key on the ball, not the man, on the ball. - Key on the ball. Key on the ball. - What's so funny, Green? Come on, you're next. Come on. - What the hell am I being paddled for? - Talk to your family like that, Green? - Aw come on, what for? - You don't call time without a whistle. Now, come on. Haven't got all day. Take 'em out, take 'em out. Come on. Whistle. Alright, let's get back to work. Let's go. - Go for a swim later, huh? (slow instrumental music) - It's not the heat, it's just the pain. - Hey, look at that. - What? - Where? - Green, over there. - [Russ] Oh, the sand's too hot for his feet. - Don't point. Oww! (giggles) (radio chattering) - [Paul Voiceover] "That revolt gives life its value. "Spread out over the whole length of a life "It restores its majesty to that life. "To a man devoid of blinders there is no finer sight "than that of the intelligence "at grips with a reality that transcends it. "The sight of human pride is unequal. "No disparagement is of any use." This must be a joke I'm missing, huh. - I wanted to apologize to ya. - Oh, ya did? - I'm sorry if I hurt you. I was a little rough I guess. That's the way you have to play the game, that's all. That's all, I apologize to you. - Well, forget it. Just the fury of battle. - Yeah, that's what I said. See ya, Steve. - So long, Russ. - I apologized. Made ya feel better? - "She lay about on the front lawn, "exposed to the road in the briefest of bikinis, "trying to attract men. "When she was not doing this, "she would spend hours telephoning anyone she knew. "Finally, she got engaged to a theological student "and rapidly seduced him. "Her parents became (mumbling). "This was the real case of nymphomania. "Her desire was uncontrollable "and she was willing to make herself "the scandal of the neighborhood. "She seduced the most religious "and well brought up young man. "No doubt had she not been in "such a circumscribed environment, "she would have behaved even more scandalously. "And since her desire was not satisfied, "would have had intercourse with anyone she could meet. "As it was, it could not be said to be her fault "that she did not distribute her favors more widely. "It was merely she had little chance to do so." - It give her address? - You know, I'd really like to meet someone like that. Look at them. Half the goddam beach wishing they could look just like that. - Is that what they're thinking? - You know, I really wonder what's gonna happen to them like five years from now. I mean, faceless members of the mass, locked in, content with their position. They don't have the slightest idea why they do anything, they just do it. - Happened this morning. But I might not feel something happens to me, I'm not sure what it is. I just feel at home. The guys, the gear, the plays, the adjustments. And when things begin to happen out there, I know what to do. I can see a play shaping up before I even think about it. When a ball's snapped, I just start to move. (Christine gasps) Hey, brains. It's alright, I fell in too, see? See, I move, I move, I move, I move. Concentrate on the hips. Now, I smash the guys on the line and I really pop the block in (mumbles) and I take out the man with the ball. Get the key on the ball, not the man, you understand? I mean, from where I stand, I always get my man. You can ask the coach about that. I feel like a radar machine. I feel like, it's a terrific feeling, really is. Really terrific. You gotta play it. - Do you really think she's a virgin? - I dunno, I'd still go to bed with her. You gonna marry a virgin? - I dunno, I'd like to. - Oh, no, not me. The girl I marry will have had a dozen lovers. - And how many will you have had? - Oh gross 144 at least. - You're just having a late start, is that it? - Sure. - See what I'm talking about, football? - Are you finished? - Let's go, Russ. - Hey, where you going? - To get something to eat. (radio chatters) - Hey, why don't we go over and get a bite to eat? I'm starved. - Why not. - [Coach] Good morning, guys. I know you guys are dedicated to this team and to this game. You gotta be to get up this early in the morning. Now, look boys, I want ya to do me a favor. Lay off the broads until after scrimmage tomorrow. I mean it. And be careful. Alright, now we're gonna get to work. Where's Green? What's the matter with him? - [Player] Who knows. Maybe his toe's infected. - [Coach] Alright, come over here. Come on, let's go. - [Paul] You wanna go for a swim? - [Christine] Here? - [Paul] We can go off the dock. - [Christine] Sure, great. - [Paul] Makes it easier to talk, have you noticed? - [Christine] What does? - [Paul] Noise, radio. - [Christine] Why is that, do you think? - [Paul] Noise leads to more noise. And in the middle of all the noise we make, sometimes there's a real bit of communication. - I met Johnny Wilm at the beginning of summer. - He graduated a couple years ago, didn't he? - Yeah, he goes to Rutgers now. He's a philosophy major. He really thinks about things. - What's he doing this summer? - Bumming around Europe. - [Paul] Mm, great. - [Christine] Isn't it? - Well, look, I think about things. I mean, what about me? - What about you? - Aren't I deep? - No, you're impossible. - No, I'm quite possible. I can be had. Did you know that I keep a journal? - Like a diary? - Not really, mostly thoughts. - I'd like to read that sometime. - Mmm-hmmm, after we swim. - Alright, you first. - Well, you go on in. I'm gonna watch your form. The way you dive, really. (gentle instrumental music) (Christine gasps) (water splashing) - How'd you like that? I thought you were gonna read to me. - I don't believe how bad this is. Really, it's incredible how anyone but a pretentious jerk could ever... This stuff is so bad, I can't believe it. Christ, you know, I never realized how bad this stuff was. - Well, there must be something you can read to me. - This is ridiculous. I mean, it's really embarrassing. - What's that? - It's just a carbon I wrote to my sister. - A carbon? - Of a letter. - Oh, I'd like to hear that. - I guess parts of it are good. - Well, I'd love to hear anything you wanna read to me. - Yeah, well you see, it's about the future. Dear Elizabeth, oh that's nothing. Let me get to the good stuff. The future? What would I like to happen? Well, first I finish a modest screenplay called High School Story, which tells the way it really is in Belmore, the stupid truth a lot of kids have been waiting for. So then I must decide which movie company will handle the film most sensitively. But just before it gets into production, I get called up for Vietnam. Luckily, the local board discovers I'm unacceptable, 4F, unbalanced nostrils. I return to New York City, I left Belmore long ago, and begin the production of High School Story. Then Julie Christie hears about it and insists upon costarring with me and the movie is a huge success. Of course, there's the embarrassing Oscar ceremony, where Julie gets one and I get several. But Julie is really upset when I return to my nymphetic mistress. I try to avoid the nonsense of being a celebrity and the frequent campus requests for my speech about Orson Wells and the achievements of young directors. What is really important to me is the opportunity afforded by the new freedom and power of being able to do whatever I want to do artistically. I get right back to writing and I begin my next film, The Man Who Killed Men. It's a good title, isn't it? - Yeah. - Which I then make. - It's a smash success. - That's putting it mildly. The Man Who Killed Men sweeps the globe, even bigger than The Sound of Music. Naturally, by acclimation, I am pressured into accepting the presidency. But then, the Earth's billions, realizing that my film points the way to the salvation of mankind, insists that I become emperor. I rule with rational, cynical goodness, except that everything gets fouled up. I sacrifice the public for my own private interest. Finally, in the arms of my lover, I probably get shot in the head like Lincoln or somebody. - Is there a part for me in this movie? - Well, not exactly. I threw over Julie Christie for ya. (light instrumental music) - Parts of that letter were beautiful, Paul. - What do you want? - Carbon paper. (door chimes) - [Shop Boy] Sorry, we're all out of it. - You went swimming with my girl this morning, right? - Hmmmm? - I said, you went swimming with my girl this morning, right? - Yeah, what about it? - I'm gonna burn your jacket, that's what's about it. You wanna give me that cigarette, please? Thank you. Don't do that again. Wanna pick that up, please? Thank you again. Now if you go swimming with that jacket on, you're gonna get yourself wet. Ha, ha, ha. - Why do you think I asked you to come with me tonight? - Don't you ever stop analyzing things? I think you asked me 'cause you wanted to. - Yeah I did. But I wanted to discuss some things with you, talk about them, you know. - Yeah, I think so. Our senior year's gonna be great. - Are you kidding? - The prom, senior day, look down on the juniors? - Were you surprised when I called? - A little. I mean, I didn't have a nervous breakdown though. I like you. Oh, Russ zapped you, big deal. There are more important things. - That's not it, not really. It's just that I've been thinking a lot lately, about where everything is at. Thinking about you, Barbara. About you and me. What's wrong? - Are you kidding? (mellow rock music) ♫ I've watched the world turn ♫ And there's nothing left I can learn. ♫ But you surprise me. ♫ You surprise me. ♫ Nothing I see is the way I thought it would be. ♫ But you surprise me. ♫ You always surprise me. ♫ You know you've hurt me many, many times. ♫ You were ready to go. ♫ Then I turned around and see you there beside me, ♫ Saying hello. ♫ I thought I knew everything ♫ All about you. ♫ But you surprise me. ♫ You surprise me. ♫ There's a key to open every secret. ♫ And an answer I know. ♫ But though I see you day after day, ♫ Your mystery grows. ♫ I've watched the world turn ♫ And there's nothing left I can do... - Now, you got something to say, I'm listening to ya. - All I wanted to say was, was that I was sorry. - What was that? - I said I was sorry. Don't you even believe me? - I believe you. Let's make it. - Okay. - Okay? - Owww, ow, ow. (waves rolling and splashing) - Barbara... I... I, I really don't know how to say this. I... I love you, Barbara. I love you. I love you. I love you, Barbara. - What is it? - I don't know. All I have to say is I love you, and everything's okay. I don't understand it. Maybe I'm cynical but I just never thought-- - I knew you didn't mean it. - I don't know. It's just that when everything is said and done, I really can't analyse it. I guess you're right. All this rationality bit and problem-solving stuff just doesn't work when it comes to love. Who can explain it? Who can tell you why? Fools give you reasons but wise men never try. All I know is Barbara, when I look at you, my mind says yes and my body says yes, and what can I say? Yes. I do love you, I do. Wait a second. There. See? I could just say anything and you'll believe me. Barbara? Barbara, you're not gonna cry. (Barbara sobs) Oh, please Barbara, don't cry. Please. Look, how the hell do I know anything? I might love you, I might, really. I could love you and not even know it. Please, Barbara look at me. I know I'm here with you now and I'm very attracted to you. And I want you Barbara, I do. Christine got to me because of Russ, that's all. Jesus, Barbara, I can't get away from you. - Oh, forget it. - I don't wanna forget it. I don't wanna. I wanna make it up to you, Barbara. I do need you. I do love you. It's not right, it just can't be like this. - You don't know what you want. You're not deep, you're just horny. I'm sorry, I just got carried away. - You're sorry. No, I deserved that. - Oh, Paul, let's try-- - Barbara, why don't-- - There's a beer in there. - No. No, I think we should go to Howard Johnson's and talk things out. (Christine squeals and giggles) - [Christine] Russ? - [Russ] Yeah. - [Christine] Are you chewing gum? - [Russ] Yeah, you want me to throw it out? - [Christine] Yeah. - [Russ] Yeah, okay, fine. - [Waitress] Will that be all? - Yes, thank you. I'd like to see you tomorrow. - Are you sure? - Sure I'm sure. - Are you still sure? - (Laughs) Come on. - Hi, Chris. - We're just leaving. - See you tomorrow, Barbara. (car engine revving) - I'm really sorry. I didn't realize my car was so temperamental. It wants to apologize to you. - I'll see you after the scrimmage. - Each team gets the ball for 10 plays and then they switch. There's no kicking. Maybe, well mayve I'll go check on the car tomorrow instead. Look, we'll be seeing each other. - Oh? - Really. I'll give you a call. I'd like to see you. I think this year we could-- - I wanna see you too. (slow instrumental music) - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (airplane engine roars) (gunshot fires) - Nice shot. Hey, that's wild. Where'd you get that? - My dad gets dozens from work. - Yeah? - Yeah, keep it. - Thanks. - Listen, Al's giving me a ride to the scrimmage. You want a lift? - Yeah, I'd appreciate that. Do you see that bird anywhere? - I think it came down in the water. - I guess we'll have to forget it then. - You went out with Barbara, didn't you? - Yeah. - How'd you do it? - Alright, I guess. - Who wouldn't? - Hey Steve, did you ever talk to Barbara? - Does she talk? Come on. (players chattering) - You guys get any birds? - Yeah, one. - Did he shoot him or kick him? - Steve got it. - Russ here yet? - Yeah I saw him a second ago. - (Mumbles) back there? - Diane Faucet. - What about her? - She goes down. - How would you know? - I know, jerko. Got a butt? - Sorry, I don't smoke. - Coach'll get your ass if he catches you. - In there. - Who's got a light? - Hey. Hey, don't fool around, huh (whistles). Is that thing loaded? Hey, this is no joke, Green. Fooling around with a loaded weapon before scrimmage. Hey, what's the matter with you, huh? Heh, fell in the urinal there. What's the matter, you mad about something? Oh, I know what, you're mad about the car, right? It was just a little friendly joke, Green. Just like a wire, I took the wire out. You put the wire back, car'll run like new. No damage, no big deal. Green. I like you, Green, more or less. I've always spoken very highly about your kicking. Ask the guys, some of the guys. Well, what do you want, Green? You want my girl? You want Christine? You can have her. My blessing go with the both of you. You want me to miss scrimmage? We'll take off, we'll go somewhere, we'll talk it over. We'll go to Howard Johnson's and talk it over man to man. Whaddya say, Howard Johnson's, Green? Look, Green, we can work this thing out. You're a smart boy. I noticed that. You've been around, right? I've seen you. I'm smart, you're smart. Green, you're a smart boy. Please, please. Green. (lighter snaps) It's a cigarette lighter. - Hey, that was cool. Really cool. It was beautiful, it was beautiful. - Hey, I'll see ya later, okay. - Yeah, yeah. - Hey, good luck. (lively rock music) ♫ There they go all in a row ♫ Smiles and suntan toes are running ♫ Down to the beach. ♫ Waiving to us as they float ♫ On their big ball. - Hi, what are you laughing at? I've been waiting for you all day. - Come on, get in. ♫ We've got better things to do. ♫ Think it's time we got away. ♫ Think we'll miss that boat today. ♫ We're all above it today. ♫ There they go I know those people frozen in a movie pose ♫ With sunglasses on. ♫ If they'd open up their eyes ♫ I have a surprise. ♫ I'm just standing on the shore, ♫ I'm the one they're waiting for. ♫ Think it's time we got away. ♫ Think we'll miss that boat today. ♫ We're all above it today. ♫ I'm just standing on the shore. ♫ I'm the one they're waiting for. ♫ Think it's time to get away. ♫ Think we'll miss that boat today. ♫ We're all above it today. ♫ All above it today.
