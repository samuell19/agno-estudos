- Hey. Why this sudden promotion? For refurbishment. - This ship's Chinese registered. - You have problem with that? - It's impossible, I can't captain a Chinese ship. - This is new China. Everything is impossible, but all things are possible. I will double this when you finish the mission. - Mission? - Captain. Good luck. - Good luck. - We sail at dawn. Your orders. - We know the way to China. - Call captain please. - I am the captain. Wait! What are you doing here? - Let me rest. Please. Hide me. - What trouble are you in? If you don't tell me, I can't help you. - Who are you? Oh, you are captain. - Who gave you permission to board my ship? - We are looking for a woman. - Aren't we all? - A murderer. - In my cabin. Captain to captain. - You wanted to speak to me, captain to captain. - You know what we Chinese say about women onboard ships? Well, it's brought me a great misfortune. - So, who did this woman murder? My first mate, son of an important government official. - I see, a murderer, you say. - She's here somewhere, I know her. - A murderer? - That's what my crew believe. - And what do you believe? - You see, this woman, Li, is my wife. - You want your wife to face the death penalty? But do you know the penalty for-- - The penalty for harboring a murderer? - What if she drowned? It's a long way to swim to shore. Go ahead. - I must confess. - Yes? - From everything you've told me Captain Wang. Her trying to swim to shore seems like suicide. - You see. I thought I could save her. - I trusted you, and you betray me! - I just saved your life. - Only by chance! - You can jump off my ship now. I'm not stopping you. - Do you believe his story? - Be quiet, my crew might hear you. - Well do you? Or I'll give you up. - We know what you are up to. - With what? - Why do you think the Boss gave you this bad job? - Why did you come back then? I don't want drunks on my ship! - What do we do now, Mrs. Wang? - Don't call me that. I'm no longer anybody's wife. You must let me go. - Don't you understand? We're twelve miles off the coast because I can't risk sailing through Chinese territorial waters. - Hm. - So I should let you drown? - Out there, you're a murderer. In here, you don't exist. Echo sounder? - Not working. Very old. Umi, your girlfriend? - Maybe. - Me, no girlfriend. No wife. Very lonely job. - Yeah. - Pacific, change course. Pacific, change course immediately. - Worried I might murder you? Don't ever try to lock me in! - What was I thinking? I should've never taken this job. So badly wanted to be a captain. Was it murder? - Only I know what I'm guilty of. - But you did kill a man? - A man died because of what I did. - Not just any man, an official which-- - Listen to me. - So you did the right thing? I must go now, show myself on deck. Hope you like Cuban music. - Why did you marry Wang? - It was my duty. - Your duty? - You obviously don't understand family ties. - That's right, I left them all behind, like my father, Poland. - You care only for yourself? - That's what makes me a free man. My father had too many principles. He even forbade Communist music at home, Cuban, Russian, Chinese. And I, well. - Just ran away to the sea. - Better than swimming away. - Why do you care if I live or die? - Look, the crew will do anything to frustrate my sailing to Shanghai. If they see you trying to escape, they'll alert the police. I'll be jailed and you executed. Is that what you want? - Huh? - So you know where your cabin is? - Don't you have Polish music? - No. - No music from your own country? - No. You've been through my things? - I wanted to know more about you. Why did you leave home? - Old Europe, new China. I wanted to go to Cuba, but got on the wrong ship. This is my first command. It's what I always dreamed of and-- - So, all your dreams came true. I haven't been laid yet. - You're like a boy, only think of one thing. - Spend time with them. Good excuse to drink with the crew. - Not on my ship. - And stop wearing a captain's outfit. The crew knows who you are. - Drunk and in charge of a ship. - Pretend drunk then. Like you're pretend captain. - Our ship, our home. - Turns out the drunk next door is the old captain. We must be even more careful now. It's from my boss. Instructions on where, when, and how to sink the ship. - And if you don't? - He's paying me a lot of money. - What will you do? - It's not a request, it's an order. - I can never come back to life again. - You could come to life in another country. - You'd do that for me? - Yeah. - And risk everything? - What is it you want? - All I want, is that you understand me. - What do you care? - He seems to care, for some reason. - It's no captain's duty to sink his ship. - Didn't stop you taking the Boss's money as well. - Do the right thing. - Yang Shu, Yang Shu! - Man overboard! Man overboard, port side! - Port side? - Couldn't see. - It is his choice. Better for him, better for us. - You'll live. I don't want you to stop wanting me. - But you don't want me. - We all want to be loved, but few want to love. - You can play, can't you? - Of course. - Let the crew know you can. - One of my father's patriotic songs. - I loved to dance, before I married Wang. - I haven't sung that since I left home. My father always told me that a man without principles becomes a slave to other men's limits. And he asked me, "what do you want? "Limits or horizons?" I want horizons. And so do you. - I'll stay. Not so lonely here. - Let's get closer to the coast. - Into territorial waters? - I'll take that risk. We're here. - This is where the Boss ordered you to wreck the ship. The sea is much calmer in this channel. Wang was always taking short cuts through here, and I was his navigator. You can shelter from the storm. It's a very dangerous passage, there are some submerged rocks. - We will take this shorter course. - Impossible, too many small islands. - That's what navigation is about. - Still planning to sink us? - Trust me. - Have you thought how to get me off without being seen? - I have. Half speed. - Half speed! - Thirty to port! - Thirty to port. Hard to port! - I take no responsibility for this. - Now! - Hard to port! - Can't. - I'll call you. Must know you're safe. - Quick, cut my hair. Shorter, like yours. - Go now. And don't look back. - Map. Mong Lin, slow ahead, over. - Slow ahead! - Hard to port, over. All clear for now, over. - Yes, captain. - You disobeyed my orders! - I used it as a deposit for the refurbishment. - What? The money you gave me and Mong Lin... to sink the ship. ♪ Havana ♪ This is Cuba ♪ Havana at night ♪ Havana night ♪ You have to look into the faces ♪ ♪ You have to feel the island spirit ♪ ♪ Dance with me ♪ That is the key ♪ We're Cubans and we're proud to be ♪ ♪ Havana, this is Cuba ♪ Havana at night ♪ Havana night ♪ We are what our ancestors taught us, oh oh ♪ ♪ Havana, this is Cuba ♪ Havana, this is us ♪ Havana, this is us ♪ Havana, this is Cuba ♪ Havana, this is us ♪ Havana, this is Cuba ♪ Havana, this is us ♪ Havana, this is Cuba ♪ Havana, this is us ♪ Havana, this is Cuba ♪ Havana, this is us ♪ Havana, this is Cuba ♪ Havana, this is us ♪ Havana, this is Cuba ♪ Havana, this is us ♪ Cuba
