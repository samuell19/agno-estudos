Duke: If you're gonna accomplish something, You gonna have to take risks. To land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth By the end of the decade. Duke: It was really a fighter pilot's ride. We were close to not being able to come home. Collins: And then bingo, the moon was in your window, Filled your window. I just looked in awe at this incredibly beautiful planet. Armstrong: It's one small step for man, One giant leap for mankind. Captions paid for by discovery communications [ indistinct conversations ] Hello. I'm richard garriott. I'm the first second-generation american astronaut, Son of apollo-era astronaut owen garriott, Who flew on skylab and the space shuttle. And here on the 50th anniversary of the apollo moon landings, We are going to bring together these apollo astronauts Who almost never get the chance to get together, And we will sit down with each of them... Well, again, thank you so much. [ laughing ] ...And talk about their amazing experiences On their journeys to the moon. -Yeah. -Okay. -Alright, let's roll it. -Copy mark. Let me welcome you all today To what is clearly a historic gathering Of six of the apollo astronauts who are at the tip Of our national effort to take humanity from its cradle here On earth and for the first time, Extend our reach 240,000 miles through space To the surface of the moon. These six astronauts flew aboard apollo missions Which took us incrementally further And further until we had not only landed on the moon, But we had done it six times. 12 of our astronauts walked on the moon. They brought back 842 pounds of moon rocks. The first three crews walked 4.4 miles across the surface, And the last three used rovers to cover about 56 miles. From apollo 7, the first apollo To carry people into space, lasting 11 days in space. For the first time, we also had live tv. Man: We have liftoff. Garriott: Please welcome apollo 7 lunar pilot walt cunningham. [ cheers and applause ] From apollo 9, the first crewed saturn v full stack. Also performed crewed dockings and a space walk. Please welcome apollo 9 lunar module pilot Rusty schweickart. [ cheers and applause ] From apollo 11, the command pilot Who was left alone in orbit around the moon When his crewmates descended to the surface, Becoming likely the loneliest man In the universe, michael collins. [ cheers and applause ] Also welcome from apollo 11, the lunar module pilot, Who along with neil armstrong, became the first humans To walk on the moon. I give you buzz aldrin. [ cheers and applause ] From apollo 15, the fourth successful landing on the moon And had a strong focus on science For their entire mission, Please welcome the apollo 15 command module pilot, Al worden. [ cheers and applause ] And finally please welcome the apollo 16 lunar module pilot Who drove a long stint of very rough terrain. Charlie duke. [ cheers and applause ] First to you, walt -- You think of the early projects, Mercury and gemini and apollos 7, 8, 9, 10 -- These were all stepping stones to reaching the moon. Can you tell us a little bit about this drive to get there And how quickly we tested these things one after the next? I think the public today doesn't realize The steps it took to get there. I think the number was something like 240,000 people Who worked on apollo or something like that, And we worked 10, 12 hours a day, Sometimes 24 hours a day if it took it, Six days, seven days a week, Whatever was required because of that incredible, Imaginative goal that kennedy set. We choose to go to the moon in this decade And do the other things, not because they are easy But because they are hard. Aldrin: When kennedy gave his talk, Obviously we had an objective -- the moon. We had a time -- before the end of the decade. We did not have a plan. That was a wonderful, wonderful mandate for us. It was a masterpiece of simplicity. We knew exactly what we had to do And exactly when we had to do it. Now, the how of it, that was left to us. Duke: But it was a bold program And we had eight years and six months From kennedy's announcement to get it done. So the focus was let's do it. You were learning all about the spacecraft. We were learning geology. We were learning the science that we were going To be doing on the moon. You wanted to know it, At least the spacecraft systems, absolutely perfectly Because you could kill yourself if you do something wrong. Worden: Over the three-year period, I got 1,500 hours of simulator time. And if you calculate that out, that's 500 hours a year So it's like 25% of my time was in the simulator. The gemini program was a lot of fun and it was good And it was exciting And maybe a tiny bit like a sporting event. The apollo program wasn't no sporting event, baby. The eyes of the world were on you, And you better have everything in perfect alignment. Time's running out and we're being watched by friends And by foes as well. Worden: The whole thing was a competition between us And the russians. We all wanted to win on our side. ♪ Cunningham: I think the most significant difference then And now was the attitude that we had, All fighter pilots, mostly test pilots, We had confidence in ourselves. We also had that feeling, I'm sure, That you're not gonna get any place unless you are willing To stick your neck out. And that was risky, because it was the first one, But that's just the way we did. Wallace: This is a cbs news special report. This is mike wallace at the cbs news room in new york. America's first three apollo astronauts were trapped And killed by a flash fire that swept their moon ship Early tonight during a launchpad test At cape kennedy in florida. I remember that was on a Friday, and it was late afternoon. We had performed that same test on Thursday. But we had not closed the hatch. And when you don't close the hatch, You don't have to secure and operate at 100% oxygen. Man: [ shouts ] Fire in the cockpit! [ screaming ] [ radio chatter ] Man #2: Get in there and help them. Cunningham: Operating at 100% oxygen and then you have To over-pressurize that to keep the hatch closed. Nobody had really been as terribly concerned As we should have. But what that did, that initiated changes In the apollo program and subsequent other programs too. On the operations with 100% oxygen. Everybody started operating differently. And a lot of that came about because our friends, Grissom, white, and chaffee, sacrificed their lives, Triggered some of that. It was interesting to me that at edwards, They lost several pilots in experimental aircraft. They crashed. Now, the fire showed up on page one, And the experimental aircraft crashes showed up on page 20. So that's the difference in how we perceive these things. But I got to tell you, the feeling is the same. I don't care whether you're sitting at edwards as a pilot Or you're sitting at the cape as an astronaut Getting ready to launch, When you lose the crew, it's bad. ♪ And I absolutely believe that because we had that fire, We were able to make changes in the spacecraft That allowed every flight after that to be successful. I think it was because of that. I really do believe that. Space flight is not risk-free, And even after apollo 1 caught fire and the crew was killed, We were dead in the water, but we weren't giving up. ♪ Apollo 7 was the first manned apollo launch. The longest, most ambitious, most successful First test flight of any new flying machine ever. Then you've got apollo 8. And apollo 8, we broke the barrier To get away from the earth's gravitational field. Apollo 9, we finally got To where we could test a lunar module. Finally, apollo 10, we got to the point Where they went through everything On that apollo 11 landing, except the last 50,000 feet. Then, we get apollo 11 and they did one hell of a fine job. [ applause ] [ chuckles ] People waving, like goodbye. Everything was going [ shakes ] Duke: It was eerie at first. ♪ Cunningham: We launched on the 11th of October in 1968. There was no frightened morning or anything like that In getting ready for that flight. Schweickart: It was a morning like any other morning. Not quite, but we had our breakfast, We went down to the medical office. The difference, of course, was as we went out To the transfer van, which took us From the crew quarters out to the pad, There were more people and news cameras and things And people waving, like goodbye, and things like that. Duke: We took a van out to the launchpad. Every other time I had been out there, There was people scurrying over it, Like a colony of ants, People everywhere on the vehicle. And we get out of the van, and there's nobody around. It was eerie at first. Schweickart: Going up to the top deck where we walked Across that kind of a long corridor that led out To the little white room docked to the door Of the command module. Everybody a little bit more edgy And quiet than all the simulations But you know, you know everyone that's there helping you Get in the spacecraft. You're joking around with people. What I had on the back of my little air conditioning unit Was an 8.5" by 11" piece of paper with a piece Of tape on it and when guenter wendt leaned over To put jim mcdivitt in the spacecraft, I took that piece of paper off and put it on guenter's back, Unknown to him, taped it to his back So that when he stood up and the camera got a picture Of him, it said, "kick me." [ both laugh ] Duke: What I remember is excitement. Man, the day has finally arrived And we're gonna get our chance to go, And we got a four-hour window To get this thing off the ground. And so our attitude was, "keep counting, keep counting. Let's go. I'm ready. I've trained two years for this." You have to convince yourself it's another simulator exercise. You've been through that launch sequence so many times That you kind of go through it by rote. Duke: I think we were strapped in, ready to go, Hatch closed maybe an hour before liftoff And we were listening to the count. Man: 10, 9, 8. Ignition sequence start. Engines on. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. All engines running. Liftoff. We have liftoff. ♪ Schweickart: Every movie that you've ever seen about space, If there's a rocket engine going, Everything is going [ shakes ] like that. That's not true at all. It doesn't go "boom." It goes very slowly. ♪ We had 7.5 million pounds pushing 6.5 million. Worden: We didn't even know we were off the pad. Launch control had to tell us, we moved so slow. Collins: You can see it as a spectator. You see how slowly it rises. What you don't see is in order To keep it's upward trajectory perfect And not bumping into the launch tower That's right next to you. Your five engines are swiveling back and forth. You know, like balancing a broom on the end of your hand. So the engines are doing this. Collins: And all I can think of is, "I don't mind the lateral that way, But the lateral that way, I don't want any more of that, Thank you. We're gonna bump into the launch tower." Duke: The windows are covered over In apollo so you can't see outside at this point. You're just riding along. Schweickart: And the ground gets further and further away, Which is where the sound comes from. It doesn't come up through the stack. It's the engines bouncing off the ground Coming up externally. So the sound drops very rapidly To 10 seconds after liftoff, it's almost totally quiet And the vibration has almost completely stopped. Now the acceleration is increasing pretty rapidly To about 6 g's or so on the first stage. And the really interesting thing on our mission was That dave and I, because we might've had to get out rapidly If we had an abort before liftoff, We loosened our shoulder straps after they closed the door. They had tightened very tight. At the end of first-stage boost, The vehicle is compressed because it's very, very light At that time, and the 7 million pounds of thrust. All of a sudden, the engines cut off and it expands, Because it's this tube that's now empty of all that fuel. And dave and I suddenly went like that And here's the instrument panel And it was like right there. And both of us looked at each other And went, "whoa, we got to tell the next guys not to do that." [ laughs ] First stage lasted on our flight for two minutes and 41 seconds, And we consumed 4.5 million pounds of fuel. Well over half the weight of the vehicle. Second stage ignited, the vibration went away And it was, again, a slow acceleration, about 1 g. That got us to 100 miles and then it dropped off, And then the third stage accelerated us To orbital velocity. We were going in heads down, So had a beautiful view of the atlantic. And we went into darkness over africa, And that was spectacular to see sunset And the fires of africa and the lights of africa. Worden: I didn't really think about, "hey, we're going 25,000 miles an hour now." We didn't even have a toilet. We never simulated not getting back. Garriott: You know, apollo 9 was the first saturn v launch With the full stack, all of the parts And pieces that were to be required to land on the moon. If I can move over to you, rusty, What really was apollo 9 and what did you guys accomplish? We had the great privilege Of flying the lunar module for the first time. So our mission was to really test everything About the lunar module that could possibly be tested In orbit around the earth before we took it out to the moon. But to enable all of my buddies here To actually do the work that they did out on the moon, We couldn't drag an umbilical cord When guys were running around the moon So I had the portable life-support system on my back. And in addition, I was wearing the brand-new apollo space suit, Which was much more mobile And flexible than the earlier gemini suit. Then following the e.V.A. That I did on the fifth day of the mission, Jim mcdivitt, the commander, and I left dave scott And our heat shield in orbit, And we separated by 100 miles in the lunar module, And we used the rendezvous technique And procedures that the guys later would use Coming up off the moon to get back. And we validated all of those maneuvers in order To get back to dave and our heat shield So we could return safely to earth. But we didn't think about the possibility Of not getting back. We'd gotten back 100 times in the simulation So, you know, we'd get back again. We never simulated not getting back. [ laughter ] It was no problem. Everything worked beautifully, I would say. Worden: Everything worked perfectly on our flight. In fact, we did the t.L.I. Over hawaii And our recovery ship was sitting in the water, And they saw us. They could see it go. Duke: We left earth's orbit over australia, And we accelerated to 25,000 miles an hour. So I didn't really think much about, "hey, we're going 25,000 miles an hour now." There's nothing going by the window, So you have no idea at all how fast you're going. We did a lot of housekeeping, Just living in a spacecraft, Three guys for three days going out to the moon. When I speak at my grandkids' class, That's the one question -- "how do you go to the bathroom?" And I tell everybody, "very, very carefully." [ laughs ] We did not -- it was not a triumph of technology. We didn't even have a toilet in apollo. It was a bag that you had to stick in the right place. Nothing goes to the bottom of the bag in zero gravity, So it was a real chore. We had some laughs and some accidents. But it was three guys, no big deal. Collins: On the way to the moon, They worried about temperature, So if your spacecraft just sat there, Everything boiled over on that side, And everything froze stiff on that side. So you had to rotate, like a chicken on a barbecue. And not only were you rotating, But the moon was in the wrong place. You were canted so you didn't see The moon going by your window. You saw just black space. And then bingo, the moon was in your window, Filled your window. It was a very spectacular thing Because it looked, not like a flat plate, But it looked three-dimensional. Its belly bulged out toward you. The lights were lighter. The darks were darker. Part of it was almost obscured. The sun was behind you, and it was cascading around the rim, The golden rim. You had this, what an artist would have given a fortune for, This beautiful spectacle of this thing About to hit you practically. Mine were the first words from the moon. John young told me, "don't touch this handle. I'm the driver." It was the only time in a flight I had a moment of fear. Buzz, going down in the lunar module And preparing to land on the ground, You had a series of off-nominal situations, A series of malfunctions, a series of alarms that went off. Kranz was debating whether you had enough comm To actually continue the landing. You had the spotty radar data in the lem and mission control. You had a 1202 computer overload. You landed long, Well past your rehearsed landing sites. Well, we did land long, but that was neil's fault. [ laughter ] When you were putting that thing down, You were 15 seconds from running out of fuel. Yeah. Where was your mind between elation That you still had a little fuel left Or fear that you were approaching the end Of your fuel supply? Peaceful at 16 seconds. Mine were the first words from the moon -- "contact light. Engines stop." My remembrance is I patted him on the shoulder. He says we shook hands. Who knows? When neil set buzz down there on the surface of the moon, They set down so gently that the planned compression Of hydraulic shocks underneath it failed to compress, And that made that first step a true giant leap. At the bottom of the ladder is not the lunar surface. There's a big pad. Now, when you come down the ladder And you get to the last rung and you jump down from there, You're not on the moon yet. You're down on this landing gear pad. Now, neil, he said, because we may get tired out there, That we ought to see if we can jump back up To that bottom rung on the ladder. Good thought, neil. [ laughter ] So I got down to the bottom of the ladder. And then jumped up and I missed. [ laughs ] so I had to do it again. Geez, come on, buzz. You started out doing a mistake. [ laughter ] And, charlie, give us a little sense of what it was like To drive a lunar rover, this kind of dune buggy. John young told me, "don't touch this handle. I'm the driver." [ laughter ] -yeah. So I was the navigator, and it was bouncy. The lunar rover only weighed 80 pounds up on the moon. Sometimes, both front wheels were off the surface. It was real squirrelly. The back end, it's like driving on ice and breaking loose. But it was a lot of fun, and john had to really focus On the surface because you'd go over a ridge And there'd be a rock or a crater or something out there, And he'd have to scoot around. There's not any roads on the moon. Fortunately, no traffic either, So john said we set the moon speed record. Cernan said he set the moon speed record on 17, But we don't argue because the speedometer went To 17 kilometers an hour, and it was off-scale high On both systems, so whatever we went was a lot of fun. You know, everybody does something on the moon. You know, shepard hit a golf ball. And the hammer feather trick. So we thought it would be nice To celebrate the olympics in '72. And it was the only time in a flight I had a moment of fear. As I jumped, my center of gravity went backwards Because of the backpack and I went over it like this, On my back. Tv cameras watching. You can see me scrambling for my balance. The backpack's a fragile system, And it's your life-support system. And if it breaks, you're dead. And so I had to do something And I roll right and broke my fall, Bounced onto my back. And john young came over first. He said, "that wasn't very smart, charlie. Are you okay?" And I said, "I think so. Help me up." You could hear the pumps running, You could check your pressure gauges And everything, and I began to calm down. I'm gonna be okay. But it was scary. You don't give up. We almost did not get off. I had bet a case of beer they were dead men. Wow. Here's a question for mike or al or both of you If you have thoughts on that. I presume that you all had procedures for what would happen If your crewmates could not Get back up off the surface of the moon, And so I'm just curious how that felt. And you must've rehearsed it, right? You must've at least gone through the procedures Of "what am I going to do if I'm going to leave two people On the surface of the moon." When I was by myself in the command module, I had on a string around my neck, An 8" by 12" loose leaf notebook with 18 pages in it. And the 18 pages were the various rendezvous possibilities Should things have gone slightly awry on the moon. Did you prepare for the extreme Of them not being able to get off, mike? -No. -No. No, if they couldn't get off, they were dead men. You didn't need them anyway. [ chuckles ] We needed him. Well, I kind of got used to them. I prefer the white mice, to tell you the truth. But they were alright. [ applause ] In my mind, there were two situations that we faced. One is if they couldn't get off the surface at all. That's a simple decision -- you come home. If they got off the moon's surface And it took me all my fuel to get to them, I would still do that. You just keep going until you get 'em if you can. And if all three of you stay there forever, That's the way it is. We almost did not get off. We had the flight plan that we were gonna land, And then there was a sleep period after. So we went outside, we come back in again. Now we're getting ready to sleep so I said to neil, "I take dibs on the floor." There was only one flat place in that thing, And it was the floor. So I laid down on the floor, And there's this little black object. Didn't look like it belonged there. This was a circuit breaker that was broken. So I looked at the row of circuit breakers And it says "engine arm." Wow. So, you get ready to land, you push that thing in, The descent engine lights, You get on the surface of the moon, And you pull that out. Well, if you want to come home, You got to push that thing in again, but it's broken off. So we missed the greatest line that lovell had later on. "houston, we got a problem." [ laughter ] So they said, "we're gonna work at this down here, So you guys up there just go to sleep." [ laughter ] So we get up in the morning, And they say, from mission control, "we couldn't find any way to get around That circuit breaker." So, I looked, "what can I use?" I looked at my little finger, And there's electricity behind there. I'm not sure that that's gonna work. So I used the felt-tipped pen two hours before, "hey, we got circuit. We got power!" So, we were coming pretty close to not being able to come home. Stage, engine arm basket. Good liftoff, automatic. [ "the air force song" plays ] ♪ ♪ Collins: Coming back, when you approach the atmosphere, You have very little latitude. If you're a little bit too high, You go off into a 30-day orbit, But you run out of oxygen maybe 25 days before that. If you go down a little too steep, you come in, You burn up, so all these things are on your mind And you kind of check them off as you go through them. And whoosh, we're down on the water, We're elation. ♪ I had bet a case of beer with neil That when the spacecraft hit the water, It would remain right-side up. We had two positions -- it could flip over, They called that stable two. It wasn't dangerous, but it was a mess inside. You were hanging upside down by your straps and everything. So buzz's responsibility was to push in a couple Of circuit breakers that enabled the circuit For me to disconnect the parachute As soon as we touched down so it wouldn't flip over. Well, whomp, we hit, and buzz's hand slipped Off the circuit breaker panel. [ laughter ] And by the time he could get back to it, Crap, over we came into it. So that was the end of apollo 11 for me. ♪ ♪ ♪ When you started this whole thing, You talked only about the 12 guys who walked on the moon. And I just want to put in a plug for cmps, The six who stayed in orbit. Yeah, here, here. Okay? Here, here. [ applause ] One of the bad things about flying in space was We had press conferences. The entire focus of the press Was on me and that orbit. "well, now you were the loneliest man In the only lonely history of history, And you were in that lonely little spacecraft, So lonely, behind the lonely moon, weren't you lonely?" Oh, god, no, I was happy. I had my happy little home. I had coffee. Geez, I had hot coffee. I had music, even, if I wanted it. On the backside, I didn't have to listen To mission control yakking at me. It was commodious. It was safe. I was accustomed, anyway, To being in flying machines by myself. That part was no big deal. So I had a happy little home. Worden: Yeah, I loved it. Got rid of those guys for while. [ laughs ] It was kind of interesting -- No matter what I was doing or where I was, When I came around the far side of the moon, I always got to a window to watch the earth rise. That's the most spectacular thing You can see from out there. And so I'm just copying stuff from houston And giving burn reports and stuff like that, And into my window floated the earth. There's that jewel of earth Just suspended in the blackness of space. It's about 20,000 miles away, And you can see the whole circle of the earth. And you could see the arctic circle, Down across canada, the u.S., mexico, central america. Big swath of the eastern pacific. It was breathtaking. It was so beautiful. People say, "oh, tell me about what you remember About the moon?" But the most impressive sight to me Of the whole flight was the earth. Literally, the size of your thumbnail, But if you take your hand away, It kept popping back into view. It kind of insisted that it wanted to be looked at. It was the main thing, the one and only show. There's home, there's everything I've ever known. And gorgeous little thing, blue and white, very shiny, Very bright. Little smear of tan. You know, we call them continents. By accident, when I'm on my e.V.A., Dave scott was taking movies of my traverse. The movie camera that he was using Failed after two seconds, and he said, "hey, I'd like to try to fix this." Jim mcdivitt, who was the commander, said, "you got five minutes, dave. Rusty, stay right there." I was partway up the handrail. I let go with my right hand, swung around like this, And saw that whole earth behind the command module, The sun up here, off my shoulder and the horizon Of this incredibly beautiful earth over there. And I said to myself, explicitly, "I'm not an astronaut. I'm a human being. Let this come in." I just looked in awe at this incredibly beautiful planet. And all of these questions came in As I was looking at it in total silence. How did I get here? Why am I here? What's going on? What do I mean when I say, "am I me or am I us?" It took several years to really process all those questions, But the recognition that we, life -- We're the only life anywhere we know in the universe, But certainly in our little corner of the universe -- We have a responsibility to preserve life And to continue this unbelievable process Of evolution that we are a part of. And that was the real message that came in. I was just, at that moment, a sensing element for humanity As we begin moving out from mother earth into the cosmos. I referred to that moment as cosmic birth. That's the moment of birth out of mother earth. And if you think about human birth, It's only after birth that we love our mother. Before that, we're just totally dependent on her, But after birth, We recognize not only do we love our mother, But we also have responsibility for our mother. Collins: When I returned to earth, We were privileged to make a trip around the world. Visited 29 countries or so, and I was flabbergasted Because I thought wherever we went, They'd say, "oh, you americans. Congratulations, you americans finally did it." Unh-unh. Everywhere we went, people said, "we did it, we did it!" So, it was a remarkable example Of how countries can be brought together, Perhaps under extraordinary circumstances, But nonetheless, it's possible. Duke: I had that thought that, you know, We're all down there on earth, And you don't see any europe Or asia or north america. You just see earth. And we got to learn to try to get along with everybody. We all share everything. And so in the long run, it was the beginning Of our environmental revolution, if you will, To wake up about our planet. I'm just humbled and eternally grateful That I had a chance to participate in apollo In such a significant way. ♪ Garriott: If you think of all the great milestones Of human history that might be remembered 1,000 years from now, This is gonna be the cream of the crop. It will be very hard to overestimate How difficult it was To go from never having flown an object into space, And in less than 10 years, Landing humans safely on the surface of the moon And returning them back to earth, A feat which has never been repeated Since the retirement of apollo. To have the political will, To have the financial And industrial complex to pull it off, To invent all the computing systems, Navigation systems, Alloys of metals to hold and pump cryogenic fuels, To create heat shields To stand the searing heats of re-entry, To navigate 240,000 miles away from the earth, And to go into orbit, much less land, On the surface of an alien body -- All of those things were done and done well During that 10-year period that I believe was one Of the greatest advancements of scientific And industrial capability that the earth has ever seen. ♪ I would like to thank our amazing panelists, These six astronauts who took us from the earth to the moon!
