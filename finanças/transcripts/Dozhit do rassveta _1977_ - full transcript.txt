On November 16th, 1941, the Germans started their second offensive on Moscow In some areas, they were able to defeat our troops and advance several kilometres The battles are roaring non stop in this fiery time / My brothers are laying dead in the snow near Moscow The blood-red dawns of war are above us, and we must live till dawn LIVE TILL DAWN The fire is searching to wipe us all out, with malice Dying is easy these days, it's surviving that's hard The shells come one after another, and blood is covering the world But we have our orders, and they are - survive till dawn, just live till dawn [translator - I think the whole intro sequence shows [the main character's artillery unit getting overrun] Hold on to your trench at all costs, just grab with you teeth This isn't just another trench - there's Moscow is behind us And here, me and you, by this ravine, we swear an oath... Not a step back, not a single one Scout: We're stuck here ourselves. A whole month behind their lines The guys are hungry. The two of us were sent on a separate mission. He was a good guy Don't know how we got caught, maybe somebody betrayed us Those your men? - Yes. What happened to you? We got overrrun near Kosachev If not for them, I'd be kaput Well, well Alright, we'll stick together Girl, are there Germans in that village? What about the other one? (nods both times) Let's go So? - Some sort of a depot there So what? - Many Germans Up, move out Let's go, Lieutenant Maybe blow it in the evening? Yeah, there's good approaches You didn't ditch the TNT yet? - No Captain's dead! Comrade general, may I report? It's about the German depot. What depot? Army artillery depot, about 40 km from here. Several train's worth of shells. One line of barbed wire fence, we can detonate the whole thing. We already tried to do it... You tried, you tried... Two KIA, one of them Captain Voloh, the group commander. Yes, this can't be solved with a rush. Needs some thought put into it After all, maybe we should risk it? - How can we, comrade general? He just came from behind enemy lines. We don't know what he was up to, there. Maybe he needs to be court-martialed, and we'll put him in charge of more men, which we can't spare. Still worth it. Listen, what's your name... Lieutenant Ivanovkiy. Can you show this place on a map? Yes sir. Where? - Here, comrade general Right, depot is near a highway that leads to Moscow If we deprived the Germans of ammo, we could stop them in this sector. Not a bad idea. What do you need for this mission? Men, comrade general. Men who can ski. How far did you say it is? - 40 kilometres But the thing is, we must make it there before dawn Before dawn? Alright, we'll put together a group What are you writing there? Mandatory [background check], comrade general. I'll order them to finish it quickly Attention! Line up! Present! Comrade general! - At ease. Sons, you all know what awaits you You know it will be hard, but it's necessary You see the weather? Aircraft can't do it We can only hope you succeed [Narrator] The Lieutenant didn't know much about the men he'd soon be sharing glory or death with. But he had no choice Of course, he'd much prefer to go on such a mission with his own battle-tested men. But where are the men he knew and trusted? Over the past five months of war, it's becoming hard to even remember all those hills, forests, and villages that his unit has melted into, in individual or mass graves Right behind the Lieutenant - sergeant Lukashov. He's a professional soldier, not a conscript Then private Hakimov, private Sudnik, Sheludyak the explosives expert, privates Krasnokudsky, Kudryavets The quiet private Zayats, then Pivovarov, youngest of the group, and bringing up the rear - the reliable, experienced Sergeant Major Dubin Dang. It's open, like a plate. But it's up to you, Lieutenant I'll go Well, that's your choice Maybe that's better, they wouldn't expect anyone here If anything, I'll support you with fire Who knows if the Germans expect anything. We can't ask them But we can't delay any further Who's making noise? I don't hear it - Listen better Now we cross. Not a sound! - Yes sir Can we go down the creek? - What if it didn't freeze enough? Sheludyak? Take the wounded man and go back - Yes sir [thoughts] It's probably best to send away someone else. But Sheludyak needs to live, he has a family, three kids. Sergeant Major - to me I'll try to silence the MG, we won't cross otherwise. If anything, you lead the group That's not right, someone else should do it - Who else can? Take the map I'll go. Lukashov, after me Ah, Sheludyak drew fire. They pinned him, now they'll kill him eventually Forward, after me! Run! Don't lag behind! [Thoughts] That's the first sacrifice for our success. Rest in peace, private Sheludyak I sent you to your death, even through I thought I'm sending you home alive Who shot?! I fired Why? - The safety slipped off Do you understand what you did there? I could kill you for this! Right... let's have a chat with him later Unload all weapons! Put on skis Who? - Hakimov Alive? - Yes, but barely They got him through the back. Stomach, I think First aid, quickly! Thoughts: Another one. Poor Hakimov... Now we'll have to drag him along. But how? And what do we do with him tomorrow? Right. Make a sled from skis. Does anyone know how? Yeah, me Pivovarov, give me a coat. Take off belts. Quickly! Bastards. How did they catch wind of us? We were so quiet... And the damn dogs, too. It would be alright if those were German guard dogs. But they are probably our, local strays... All the dogs on the German side serve the Germans. They're no longer our dogs... Put Hakimov on the sled So what, Lieutenant, will we drag him? Do you have other ideas? Maybe we can leave him somewhere? In some village? And pick him up on the way back... No, we won't leave him. Don't think about it. Well, got it. But I don't know if we'll make it then... We need to rush. As much as we can. Let's go! How much longer? Not far. But we must hurry. There's a highway there, we must cross it before dawn. Can't do it during the day. Got it. Keep walking then. - Yes, we have to Grab the sled, one-two. Up, up! What about you, Pivovarov? Do you need a special order? Up! How are you feeling? - I can't What do you mean? - I can't. Leave me here Are you joking? - He's acting up Pivovarov, get up. Please, get up. Sergeant Lukashov, get the private up Did you hear? Get up, do it! Stop your act! On your feet now! Stand up! Wait. Cancel that. Stop, Lukashov. - Why? We can't be playing wet nurse He's not faking. Here, Pivovarov. Couple gulps. Drink More, more How much longer, Lieutenant? We're wearing out - How's Hakimov? - Still breathing Where are the rest? - Following us. Zayats is lagging. SM Dubin is helping him Where's Pivovarov? That's him coming, I think Pivovarov, where are the rest? - I don't know. Didn't see anyone behind Cover me with a tent - Tent, here Is SM here? - No. Maybe we should wait? No. They'll follow our tracks You'll be bringing up the rear. No more stragglers! Got it. Sudnik, grab it It's okay. A couple more sprints, and we'll make it - Heave! [Despite the Lieutenant pushing the soldiers on and on, [the dawn caught them before they reached the highway...] So, still marching? - They are. And there is no end to them Up, up! Reveille! Jump around, warm up Move, move! Warm up. Get up! Now. Lukashov, breakfast. - Roger! Take out bread and canned food. - Yes! Here So, Pivovarov, did you rest? - A bit, yes How did you give out like that? Just... tired Tired... This isn't family vacation. A straggler is worse than a dead man here Yeah, the dead don't care. And we... we have skin coming off from the sled rope And there are Dubin and, what's his name, Zaitsev. Either lost, or deserted... They could even bring Germans to us - It happens, yeah Don't, Lukashov. Sergeant Major isn't that type of man He might not be the type, but anything can happen. In our 109th, we had a dashing captain. He kept building up defenses. And building, and building... In the wrong direction, it turned out You should trust people, Lukashov. People trust you. But that's me. Why do you think that Dubin is less worthy? - Because I'm here, and he isn't. Sergeant Lukashov, you're in charge. Keep perimeter watch. I'll go scout. Got it? Take care of Hakimov. Pivovarov, with me Me? - Yes Grate there It used to be here? - Exactly. Used to be What do I tell the guys now? That the Germans outsmarted us? So what? Guess they did How's Hakimov? - The same. He was delirious earlier Did you give him water? - We can't. Stomach wound Should cover him with a fur coat. - And where would we find one? When did you get here? An hour ago. Because of this guy. He broke his ski So what's there? Are there many Germans? There are no Germans. And no depot. What, no depot? - Yep, none Lieutenant, is that so? - Yes, depot's gone. They must've moved it [folk saying on hard work for nothing] Nothing to be done. Anything happens in war... Maybe it's the wrong place? It's elsewhere? It was there. The barbed wire fence is still up. So. What do we do now, commander? What do you mean? - Where do we go now? You will go back. - What, me alone? You and the others. You will try to save Hakimov. And you? - Me? I'll try to find that depot Alone? - No. Someone else will go Maybe me, Lieutenant? No, sergeant major, you will lead the group And I'll take Pivovarov. Right, Pivovarov? - Yea. Well, good. I wrote a note here. &quot;The depot changed location, group suffered losses, I'm continuing the search&quot;. Hand it to the chief of staff You'll be eating breakfast in Vyhach. - God willing, comrade Lieutenant Don't spare effort, it saves lives Take care of Hakimov, maybe he'll make it till then - Of course Fair enough. Start walking I think we take a different path back - Why? Could be an ambush on the old one - True What's your first name? - Petr I'm Igor Well Petr. Maybe we'll get lucky after all What do you think, eh? - Maybe we will Right. Let's eat something, going will be easier Right on So. Do we come back to the general with a note, and nothing done? What can we do? We can't do much with Hakimov in tow. And Lieutenant ordered us back A drink - You can't, Hakim One sip - I got none Ask the sergeant. Please I am to blame, guys! See that? Looks like a big German HQ Maybe we could... - What about the depot? [The HQ is a better target than that accursed [depot, which is who knows where in this darkness] Now, Pivovarov, you stay back a bit... That's it, I can't anymore Where are you hit? - Here, under the arm I got one too. I saw him drop Is it very painful? - Of course I'll bandage right quick. We shouldn't have gone there Why didn't you say so sooner? - I didn't know before Neither did I! Can you stand up? - I'll try No, I can't I'll go look. - For what? Need a village, one without Germans That's where I swim. I come early in the morning, there's still mist on the river... Nobody around. And the water is warm, like fresh milk. I can swim and it makes me happy for the entire day. There's a small banya there. Let's go, comrade Lieutenant Over there, a bench Shut the door Some straw brushes, as a pillow Lay down I shut the door, propped it with a shovel - Good Drink... No water? I think there is some in this bucket. Got ice in it though How are you feeling, comrade Lieutenant? - Alright There's Germans in the village Which one? - This one What do you see? - Germans walking Far? - 200 paces or so Smoking now Walking again. - The Germans? Yea. It's okay. They won't get us easily Someone on the path. Going to the well, I think. Yep! Some granny with a bucket They are walking. No, they stopped. Standing... now they're going somewhere Where? Who knows. They're hidden behind a shed now Don't worry, they won't come in here. If they try, it will be the last thing thing they do. For us too... Do you want to live? To live? That would be fine. But... Yeah, there's a but... Do you have a mother? Huh? What did you say? - Got a mother? Of course. - And a father? No, no father He died? - No. I lived with my mom If she knew what we're up to here, she'd be terrified Good mother? - Yea I'm her only one. She did everything for me Did you read some books at least? Yes, read up. All of Jules Verne, Conan Doyle, Walther Scott, Mark Twain What about Gaidar? Him too. And Dumas, read all of his I could find How did you even have the time? I got sick in 6th grade, half a year at home. So I read. Everything I could find in the library Where are you from? - Me? Near Pskov There's a town there, Porhov. Have you heard of it? No That's where we lived My mom was a school teacher You say she adored you? - Yea Since I'm the only child. It was a bit funny sometimes If you do some mischief with the kids - it's a tragedy. Same if you don't finish breakfast. And if you get sick! She'll get all the doctors in town, feed you pills for a week... It was funny Now, not so funny Not so funny... My mom's gold. I'm her only one, she's my only one. Mom's from Leningrad. She lived in St Pete before the revolution. She told me all about it, but I never made the trip I always thought about it... Now, maybe after the war - Yes, after the war of course You know, I'm okay. Not bad. If I get killed, it happens. Just sad about my mom. [He was sad about his mom too. And his dad] [Strangely, he missed his girlfriend more than his family] [He didn't talk to anyone about his first love - [he knew that others were all in the same boat] What's out there? See nothing for now All fine. Just sad I let down the general. He believed in me. Not even the general. Let everyone down. Moscow's right there... Pivovarov, how far do you think it is to that village? Which one? The one from yesterday. About two km. Why, comrade lieutenant? Need to get the skis at night. Maybe the Germans didn't get them yet? Well, I'll go then. Just wait till dark. Yes, we need those. - Yea But how will you manage? - I'll be fine waiting I'll take the SMG, ok? - Go ahead SMG gives confidence, you know. The rifle is good, shoots straight. Sergeant major zeroed it himself. What time on your watch? - 5 pm Ok, I should be back in an hour, it's close I'll go, comrade Lieutenant? - Just be careful OK. Don't worry, I'll be quiet I'll head out? - Go ahead Careful. That's our river Neman. And that's where I swim I come early in the morning, there's still mist on the river. Nobody around. And the water is warm, like fresh milk. I can swim and it makes me happy for the entire day. You know, I like lakes more. Especially forest ones, when it's calm. Rivers are better. In a lake, water smells swampy. But in a river it's fresh and clear Summers on the river are the best. - You speak Russian well We always spoke some Russian at home. My dad is Russian. And grandpa and his sister. My mom is Polish Where did you study? Polish gymnasium. There were no Russian ones back then And you sir, when did you finish officer school, if it's not a military secret? Two months ago. Artillery school. How do they decide, if one goes to artillery or infantry? Well.. Those who are good at calculations go to artillery, and those who run fast - to infantry Listen - there's music Let's go, I'll show you something Where are you going, Nina? - Come, come Come quickly Listen.. Ave Maria Is it a prayer? I don't know. I only know Schubert wrote the music Beautiful, isn't it? Come, I'll show you my flower garden, while dad's asleep Some are already in bloom. They smell wonderful at dawn! Wait, let's stand around a bit longer The sun is about to come up - how beautiful... Come You are... - What, bad? Really bad? You're a treasure What treasure? Dad wakes up, he'll show this treasure what's what Come! What's that? Planes? Some base Quiet, guys Maybe that's the one Lieutenant is looking for? Nah. He said that one had shells, and this one has oil tanks Guards, with dogs So, let's blow it? We got TNT Let's try Go, I'll hold them off [You know, I'm okay. Not bad. If I get killed, it happens] [Just sad about my mom] Must not freeze. Make it to the road, and wait for the first car with Germans [It would be great if that was a general. [Ivanovsky would blow his luxury car sky-high] [A colonel would be OK too. Or some high-ranking SS man] [The HQ in the village seems big - plenty of high ranks] [He knew what he was doing and didn't hope to survive] [But others will survive because of him, and win] [They will rebuild, love, breathe the fresh air] [Who knows, maybe their fate depends on how Lieutenant Ivanvosky dies on this road] Get up! [in German] Hands up! On December 6th 1941, having exhausted the enemy in protracted fighting, Soviet armies started their counter-offensive THE END [Translation by danshabash]
