You were fabulous, Tasha! Good. So good! I'll see you guys later! Bye! Wow. The dreidels were taking that very seriously. That was, like, method acting right there. I was just hoping they weren't gonna "spin up" their lunch. Uh, now, do you want to tell Tasha the correct lyrics, or should I? no, I will. I will. I just didn't want to embarrass her in front of everyone. But it was so cute! It's great that you volunteered to bring back the holiday performance. It's good to see you jumping back in again. Well, like Nana says, "a good distraction is never a bad idea." right? Especially at Christmas. And how's she doing? Well, her wrist isn't broken, which is good, but... You know, she-she gets dressed every morning and puts on lipstick and a smile, but... No, she's not herself. It must be hard, you know, being all alone all day in that big house, with you and will working, and with a sprained wrist, to boot. Yeah. You know, we hired a caregiver for my great-grandma, and it was a... It was a game-changer. I don't think we could afford it. Honestly. Will and I are still under a mountain of debt from all the ivf treatments. Well, it wouldn't have to be long-term. You've got enough on your plate, looking out for her, and, hopefully, taking good care of you, too. I'm fine, mo. I'm fine. But you're right. You shouldn't put a price tag on happiness. So, send me the info for that caregiver place. I'll look into it. - Okay. - All right.

Will? You should've seen how cute these kids were today! Aw, this little girl, Tasha, she melts your heart! Nana? Oh, Laurel! Hello, darling. I didn't hear you come in. You shouldn't sneak up on an old lady like that. Who are you calling old, huh? How was your day? You didn't stay in this chair all day, did ya? Of course not. I did lots of things. You know, the doctor says you can still do your embroidery, even with the brace on. Ah, and I will. okay. What'd you have to eat? I wasn't hungry. Mm. Well, I have all the ingredients for a nice Marsala. I think I'm gonna make that for dinner. Don't fuss over me. I know you've had a long day with a gaggle of six-year-olds. You think I'm making this for you? Well, then, I must help you. As much as I can, anyway. Oh, and it's night and day between the fifth-grade rehearsal and my first-graders. I mean, these kids do not sit still. Talk about wiggle worms! You were quite the same as a child. I gave you a run for your money, didn't I? You think this is my karma? Not even close. Your rebellious phase still haunts me at night. Oh, yeah. It helps, being around these kids, though. It really brightens the mood. I hope you'll come to the performance next week. Hello. - Hi! - Hi. Making Marsala. Mm! My favorite. Hey. How's the wrist? Uh, still attached. here's a little company Christmas gift... A candy basket, and a small, but very welcome bonus. Well, every little bit helps. That basket's festive. Maybe we should decorate. Bring some Christmas cheer into the house. Perhaps. well, how was your day, will? And about those candies... Any caramels in the bunch? Oh, you'll have to wait until after dinner to find out. I just worry about her. You know? She's not herself since pop's been gone, and what if she falls again? I don't really know what can we do. I mean, assisted living isn't an option. Oh, no. Of course not. I mean, that woman took me in twice, and the second time, I had a husband and... Ahem. Jonathan. I wasn't even suggesting that. I was just thinking out loud. You know, Monique mentioned this caregiver agency. They hired somebody to take care of her great-grandmother. But, I mean, I don't know how we could afford it. Maybe I should just tell the school that I'm not gonna do winter camp, and just stay with her over the break. You can't cancel on them a week before. You made a commitment to them. yeah. Well, there's always the money that your grandfather left. We promised him we'd take care of her. That's what it's there for. It would be nice to see her get out with her friends again. Yeah, they had such an active life together. I know, no one could keep up. They exhausted me! well, it could just be temporary, while her wrist heals, and just to get her over this hump. Exactly. Just until she's herself again, then you won't worry so much. We won't worry so much. I love you. I love you, too. good afternoon. Caring heart angels. You call, we care. I just made that up. Oh! Clever. Um... Hi. I'm Laurel, and I'm looking to hire a caregiver for my grandmother. We lost my grandfather in August, and then, a few weeks ago, she fell and injured her wrist, so, um, we were just looking for someone that could help out while my husband and I were at work... Cook, do some light housekeeping, take her to see her friends... That's exactly what we do here. Okay, great. Let me look in the system and see what we've got for you. sorry, I'm a holiday temp. Oh, no, that's okay. Take your time. Type away. Okay, I found it. - There it is. - Great! So, no. It looks like we don't currently have anyone available, but maybe in January? Um... We have some short-term assignments ending. Okay, well, do you have a waitlist, in case someone does - become available? - That we do! Well, you come highly recommended from someone that I trust, which is everything to me when it comes to my Nana. Aren't you just a peach? Very well, then. Fill out the online application and we'll call you as soon as anyone becomes available, at this number? Yes, yes. That would be great. Thanks. Bye-bye! Bye. "peach," huh? Okay. hey. - Hi. - How was your day? Oh, I got roped into making snickerdoodles for the faculty holiday lunch tomorrow, but other than that, good. how was yours? It was really nice, actually. Jeff from marketing brought in his new baby. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, it was really nice, actually. She was so cute. You know, Laurel, it... Will, we're not gonna have this conversation again. All right? It's been almost a year, Laurel. I know. I'm not ready. And right now, our focus needs to be on Nana, anyway, okay? all right, so put this in the microwave for maybe 45 seconds, and you should be good. Cookies! I was supposed to bring snickerdoodles to the faculty lunch, and I totally forgot. I don't know where my head's at. ugh, these kids and their muscle cars. It's just cookies. Not the end of the world. No, you underestimate how much everybody loves my snickerdoodles. It's your recipe, Nana. You created this monster. hmm. Maybe a package? Laurel and will McCullough? I'm Gloria Merkel. Caring heart angels sent me. - I made cookies. - Oh! Thank you. sorry, I just talked to caring hearts yesterday, and they told me that they didn't have any availability until January. They didn't realize until late last night, that my current assignment was complete. They said they were gonna call me. I don't know anything about the administration hooey, I just go where I'm told. This is where Helen atwater lives, yes? It is. Oh, good! So I didn't just walk into the wrong home. now, where is my charge? I can't wait to meet her. Um... Well, uh, sorry. Nana? This is... Mrs. Merkel, was it? "Mrs. Miracle"? Merkel. M-e-r-k-e-l. Although my last charge did call me "Mrs. Miracle". Now, he was only six, but I like to think that I earned that nickname. but you can call me Gloria. Oh. Well, Gloria comes from an agency. Um, I was thinking that she could stay with you while will and I are at work, and just help keep the house and... I don't need a babysitter. Oh, I'm not here to watch you, Helen. My only goal is to make your life easier, so you can relax and enjoy the holiday. Now, how about a cup of tea? Oh, yeah, that's just... how about some references? How do we know you're not some con artist, trying to take advantage of an elderly woman and her very trusting granddaughter? referrals. Recommendations. And reviews. Read them at your leisure. Wow. My mother always said, "there's no problem too big that can't be solved over a hot cup of tea." you say that, Nana. I used to. Well, let's get you back there, then. Um... Laurel, can I speak with you in the next room? Yeah. I know what you're gonna say, but this agency comes highly recommended. There's not a bad review. Anywhere! You know me... I check reviews before I'd let someone hem my pants. Yeah. I know. It's just not exactly what I expected when you said "caregiver". Same. But Monique swears by them. So, maybe we should just try it out for a day, see how it goes? Yeah. Yeah, I guess it can't hurt. I mean, it's not like they would send someone with a criminal record, right? No, of course not! I think... I hope. Well, look, if she's not the right fit, we can ask for someone else. They had one sudden opening, they could have another. Yeah, you're right. All right. Let's give it a shot. Let's see how her cookies are, though, first. Honey? don't call me that! Oh, I wouldn't dream of it. I meant, for your tea? Oh. Uh... No. Thank you. Nana, will you try it out for a bit? That way, will and I won't worry so much while we're at work. We just want you to be okay. You know I never wanted to be a burden on you. You couldn't possibly be. Not ever. You cared for me, practically my whole life. Now I just get to return the favor. It's my privilege. all right. We'll give it a shot. Okay. But make sure the safe is locked. - Okay. - Well, very well, then. Shall we... Have a tour? yeah. Okay. Nana's room is right in here and will and I are just in that room over there. Oh! You live here as well? Yeah, we moved in... To take care of her? How lovely! Actually, it was the opposite. We took a bit of a financial hit a few years back, so my Nana and pop took us in. And now that we're getting back on our feet, we didn't want to leave her all alone. That is even more lovely of you. So, um... What are her likes and dislikes? Besides me, of course. Oh, no. She just needs some time. Oh, well, it's quite invasive, having a stranger in your home. Perhaps her hobbies can give us some common ground. Well, she used to love quilting and dancing and Christmas. Yeah, she loves Christmas, but since this is the first holiday without my grandfather, she doesn't seem to want to celebrate at all. Sometimes people don't know what they want until you place it right in front of them. and what's in there? We keep that door closed. Very well, then. I, for one, am always thankful for the closed doors, as they tend to point us towards the open ones. Hmm. if I'm in class, I won't be able to answer my phone, so, in the event of an emergency, just get in touch with the office, and they'll get a message to me. Okay. Yes, and my office and cell number are on the fridge. Oh. Care for a cookie for the road? Snickerdoodles. Old family recipe. mm! Nana. Wow. They taste kind of like yours, Nana. Right? Ahem. They're fine. Hey, Laur. Why don't you take those to school for your faculty lunch? You know what? I think I might, if you don't mind? You're kind of saving me here, Mrs... Gloria. Well, isn't that fortuitous? So, you two, go on, off to work. We're going to be fine. Okay. I think we're going to be fast friends. Do you now? Okay. Well, I'll, uh, leave you guys to it, then. Have fun. Don't get into any trouble. let's just keep an open mind. I mean, her name is "Mrs. Miracle," after all. Maybe that's what we all need right now. Yeah, maybe. We need to bring some Christmas into this house, Helen. Nothing brightens a home more than lights and tinsel and an angel atop the tree. We haven't gotten around to it yet. Oh! Well, then I've arrived just in time. what's your angle? I beg your pardon? Why are you here? I was sent here at the request of people who love you very much. But just to keep you company. Oh, I can keep myself company just fine. Of course you can. So let's just sit in the silence, then, and we'll take things slow. do they pay you well at least? I would hope that keeping an old lady alive would be lucrative for you. I have never been motivated by money. Service to others has always been my driving force. that, and chocolate-covered strawberries. Oh! Very well, then. All right, mom, so, we'll call you on Christmas eve. Yeah, we'll do a video chat with the whole crew. Okay. Love you, too. Bye-bye. lunch today? hey. Hey, are you okay, buddy? Oh! Yeah, we're just trying to make sure Laurel's grandmother is okay. You are a keeper, will. You take such good care of your wife's family. Well, her family's always been there for me, so I'm happy to return the favor. Especially since I don't get to see mine very often. Oh, you're not heading there for Christmas this year? We can't really leave Nana. We were hoping my parents would come out here, but holiday airfares... We'll get back east when Laurel's on spring break. Sounds like a good and marginally inexpensive plan. Yeah. Hey, lunch today, not at our desks? Let's get some fresh air and maybe do some holiday shopping? Yes! Great idea. See you then. All right. hey, dad. I'm at school. What's up? Ah! The time-change. That's right. I'm in Cleveland. Um, so I got to come out there next week to meet a client, and I, um, was hoping we could have dinner, maybe, you and I? Next week's Christmas. Aren't you gonna be with Annie and the kids? I'll be back in time. Elina and Tim are coming home from school. He's bringing his new girlfriend. They met in the dorms and, uh, you know, I think it's getting serious. That sounds like a wonderful family celebration. I know it's not a lot of notice, but I'd really like to see you, Laurel, if you can find the time. Yeah. Okay. Well, let me check my schedule and I'll, uh, get back to you. Okay. Uh, great. Yeah. Just... just let me know. - Okay. Will do. - Bye. this might be your best batch yet. They're not that good. Are they? If, uh, everybody could raise your juice... I'd like to make a few toasts. First of all, to Laurel... Oh? Thank you for stepping up to run the holiday performance. I've been hearing from parents who are thrilled that... Despite the budget cuts... We finally have a volunteer who's willing to make this wonderful tradition possible again. Cheers, Laurel! Thank you! Okay, here's to managing expectations. Okay? I'm not a music teacher, so don't expect the same quality as an old ms. Malloy show. And I am here to say that it's gonna be even better than one of the old ms. Malloy shows. Wow. But, um, please don't tell her I said that. 'cause I know a lot of us still talk to her. Which, uh, brings me to you... Monique lozano, everyone's favorite teacher's aide, who, sadly, will be leaving us at the end of the school year, since she's having twins in June! Cheers! Congratulations! wow. Oh, thank you! what? Uh, I didn't know that she was gonna say that. I-I just told her this morning. Okay. And I was waiting for the right time to tell you. No, you can tell me these things. I'm so happy for you. um... You and will... Y-you can try fostering again. Um, there is a forever-baby... That ship has sailed for us. I am going to be the best auntie to these babies. I'm going to spoil them rotten. I'm so happy for you. Thank you. Laurel! I tried you on your cell. You have an urgent phone call from home. Oh. Thank you. Mrs. Gloria? Hello? No! It's me. Nana! What's wrong? I caught her riffling through your drawers. looking for a spatula! She was snooping! Snooping for a spatula! I thought it best not to flip the grilled cheese with my bare hands. Um... Okay, Nana, this isn't exactly an emergency. Right? She is a complete stranger and she's cooking and cleaning like she owns the place! Because that's what we're paying her to do! We don't know anything about her! Except that she doesn't make such a great grilled cheese. Okay, listen, if it will make you feel any better, I can run my own background check to find out if she's wanted by the FBI or something. I'm clean! fine. but we're counting the silver after she leaves. You have 112 pieces. I already counted it. Okay. Sounds good. Bye. We're... We're having a bit of a day. bye. sounds like it. Now, don't you tell anyone what I got for the white elephant party. It's supposed to be funny, and you buy a neck pillow. I mean, how boring can you be? Tell me what wrapping paper's yours, so I don't pick it. Hey, you roll the dice, you take your chances, my friend, that's how it works. Will? Hi. It's Nancy, from d.C.Y.F. I was your social worker with Jonathan. Yes! Of course. Hi, Nancy. How are you? I'll see you back up there? Yeah. Of course. Yeah. I'm-I'm good. I'm good. How are you and Laurel? It's been a tough year, but, uh, we're doing all right. Thank you, yeah. I'm actually glad to run into you. I've been meaning to reach out. So, we are currently experiencing a lack of qualified licensed foster families, and... I wanted to know if you two might be ready to try again. Oh, I don't know, Nancy. You were so good with Jonathan, and, look, I want you to know it doesn't always end that way. Is he okay? Jonathan? I know you probably can't tell me anything, but we think about him all the time. He and his mother are both doing quite well. look, why don't you talk about it with Laurel, and you can give me a call later? I do think that there is a child out there that would be so lucky to be placed in your home. You know what, Nancy? Put us back on the list. Same as before. Newborn. Any ethnicity. Any gender. I'll get Laurel onboard. Really? Yes. Yes. that's so great to hear, will. uh, well, um, we'll be in touch. Okay. - Bye! - Good to see you. You too! Ne gorillas, during fire at central park zoo." I've done that before. Big deal. No, will, I'm serious. Look at this. "hostage situation defused by passerby." what? Come on. Those can't all be her. I mean, the hair is different, but that's definitely her. Yes, this woman seems to have a knack for being at the right place at the right time, huh? I guess we should consider ourselves lucky she found her way to us. wait a second. This hostage thing was in 2001. She looks exactly the same. She does. Whoever her plastic surgeon is, is worth every penny. oh, and here are the results of the background check. See? No felonies, lawsuits, liens. Not so much as an unpaid parking ticket. Well, hopefully, that'll give Nana some peace of mind then. So, um... - Laurel... - hmm? Today, I saw... What? I saw a spark of the old Nana. You know? Even if it was in the form of suspicion. I thought so, too. And maybe Gloria is an acquired taste. what is that ruckus? oh, good! You heard me. I think they heard you in Guam! Here. Let me help you. - who was that? - My friend, Gabe. He helped me tie the tree to the car, then followed me home, so it wouldn't go flying off. Sorry he couldn't stop to say hello. He had an urgent matter to attend to. You two in a car club or something? "or something." coming in. Lovely morning, isn't it, Helen? Oh, it's morning, so you're half-right. All right, well, we'll have to clear... Some space. Oh, no need. It's already done. That's so strange. I-I didn't notice that you had done this when I got home yesterday. Well, I figured you'd both be tired from work, so I went ahead and did it myself. Oh, when did you do this? Oh, I think it was when you were in the den, watching your shows. a family should trim a Christmas tree together, so we'll get it ready for this evening. Okay, I'll, uh, show her where we keep everything. we've got tons, because my grandfather used to decorate from top to bottom, which is probably why this year's been so hard for Nana. I find cherishing the memories provides so much more comfort than ignoring them. Yeah. But I have plans for me and Helen, to get her back out into the world. I hope you have more luck than I did. She's just not herself right now. Well, we never are, after a loss. We find our way back to ourselves in due time. Why do you look so doubtful, Laurel? Miracles happen every day. Well, if you find one, send it my way. It's been a while since I've seen any. Hence the question... Do miracles happen because we believe, or do we believe because miracles happen? Perhaps neither. In the absence of evidence... That's why we must have faith. ah, you don't have that either? I used to, which sounds so cynical, I know. I just... You know, life happens. that's unfortunate. Well, life certainly happened to those lights. I hope it was a good one. that's okay, I'll send will out to get some. There's a place right by his office. Nonsense. We'll get them, since Helen and I are venturing out. She's due for some fun and so am I. Okay. One thing I've learned, Laurel... Our hardest times often lead to our greatest moments. I thought we could also go by the senior center and pay a visit to the quilting club. I made a quilt once. Oh! It was horrible. It was crooked and it wouldn't fit over a dog bed. But I completed it, and my mother always said, "never leave a project unfinished." Helen, are you all right? This is your car? It's quite safe. I keep it in mint condition. I've always had an affinity for things from this era. They just don't make things like this anymore. - I can't... - of course you can! I have a perfect driving record. No! I mean, this is the exact car Robert drove when I met him in 1956. He had just gotten it! Saved up for two years, working in his father's pharmacy. Oh! I used to stick my head out the window and look in the mirror as the breeze blew in my face. Oh! Well, isn't that fortuitous? Hop in. and all of these crafts are made from groups in the senior center? - Uh-huh. - Oh! I just adore a handmade craft. - Don't you? - Yep. I believe, when a person pours their heart and soul into their art, they're gifting you with a piece of themselves. My daughter, Kelly, used to make her own ornaments when Laurel was little. They were terrible, but we absolutely loved them. Somehow, they were lost when she passed away. Ah. Well, these things have a way of turning up. Nah, I don't think so. Not after so long. So Laurel came to live with you twice, is that right? The first time, she was just a teenager. Her father remarried, had a new family, and Laurel never felt like she belonged, so it was her choice. Our home has always been her home. Perhaps because her mother also grew up there. You all take such beautiful care of each other. Always. Helen, what is the story behind the closed bedroom door on the second level? Laurel doesn't seem to want to so much as look inside. That was Jonathan's room. Jonathan? We brought him home at three days old, and he was ours for 18 glorious months. They were fostering and in the final stages of adoption when the mother changed her mind. She cleaned herself up... Did the work, and he went back with her. That was just before Christmas last year. Oh, my. Well, I don't think Laurel's gotten over it yet. And then, losing pop... I only wish there was something I could do to make it better for her. You know, Helen, I think we can help her... Together. Sometimes, people don't know what they need until you place it right in front of them. Who are you? Gloria merkel. Capricorn. Because I don't need you here, Mrs. Merkel. I'm fine. But... If you want to help Laurel to move forward, that's a plan I can get behind. Very well, then. If that's what the plan needs to be in order to heal... do you think they have chocolate-covered strawberries here? ♪ Jingle bells jingle bells ♪ ♪ jingle all the way ♪ ♪ oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh ♪ Whoo! You guys are great! You are ready. I sang it right this time, Mrs. M! You sure did, and it was perfect! Now, you guys remember to bring your costumes tomorrow for our final run-through, okay? Did you hear that, parents? You're about to be blown away by your kids' talents. Really. Thank you again for doing this. Oh, of course. My older ones got to participate, but we didn't think Tasha was gonna have the opportunity. It's so much fun. She's a real talent, this kid. Really, she takes direction and she brings her a-game every time, like a pro. Then I must be doing something right. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Bye! Okay. So, parents who are bringing snacks for the performance - are confirmed. - Okay, great. Oh, and would you save an extra seat for nana's caregiver? I'm gonna try to convince Nana to come. I'm hoping all the cuteness will cheer her up. Done. How's it going with the new caregiver? It's been... Rough, yeah. Let's just say their chemistry isn't instant, no. Oh. ♪ glo-o-o-o o-o-o ♪ ♪ ...O-o-o-oria ♪ ♪ in excelsis deo ♪ do you know that was written for me? - Laurel! - Laurel. What's going on in here? Well, you can't have a tree-trimming party without freshly-baked goodies. - Can you? - Of course. She knows that. Quite the change from this morning, huh? Ohh... Oh, my goodness. Look how cute you were! Aww. With your braces? that is from the first year she came to live with us. Yeah. Pop had it made because he wanted her to feel like it was her tree. There was always a place for me with Nana and pop. Yeah, pop was the best. I know. I wish we had all those old ornaments I used to make with mom. They were the worst. Do you remember? That angel that we had for top of the tree? That crazy, lopsided thing, with the googly eyes? And then, eventually, the googly eyes fell off, so she had no eyes. She was very funky and off-kilter, and just fell off the tree constantly, but she never broke. Well, your mother said it was because it was your guardian angel. Perhaps she was right. What happened to it? Uh, well, when my dad met Annie, his wife, and we all moved in together, a lot of my mom's stuff was just lost, donated... I-I don't know. And then you came to live here, surrounded by love. Yeah. Nana and pop made sure I didn't miss a beat. Not your typical nuclear family, but whose family is, right? Well, except for maybe will's. um, how about some cocoa? Will? - Would you help me? - Of course! Anything for your cocoa. things were different... Just more normal, when my mom was alive. From what I can remember. I was only six when she passed. That must've been very difficult. That's a huge loss for a young child. I think that's maybe why I always wanted so badly to be... Ah. There is no greater love than a mother to her child. Yeah. I... Wouldn't really know. Of course you would. Your grandmother told me all about Jonathan. How he came into the world alone, his birth mother couldn't take care of him, and you gave him a loving, nurturing home to start him off right. That's what a mother does, Laurel... No matter how long it lasts. Do you have any children? I did. A daughter. Mercy. She was a spunky one. She passed fairly young. I'm so sorry. Sometimes, it feels like a century ago, and other times, it feels like it was just yesterday. How do you look at the world with such optimism, when you've been through so much? The wound never fully heals, but the aching subsides when we're ready to focus on the joy again. Something's on your mind, will. Oh. No, no. It's just work and life... Spill it. You know me too well, Nana. Um... I... Put us back on the foster list. Oh, that's wonderful! Laurel doesn't know. Oh, that's not wonderful, will. You know, in the moment, it just so felt so much like the right thing to do, I couldn't say no. I literally tried and I couldn't get the words out. Laurel is still saying that she's not ready. Sometimes, we don't know what we need until it's placed right in front of us. Tell her what it means to you, because it means the same thing to her. She just can't see it yet, through her pain. hey, Laurel... This is our song. This doesn't sound like guns n' roses, "sweet child o' mine." all right, so it's not our song per se, but it's still a good one. May I? You may. I have a wonderful idea. Date night! Who are you going on a date with, Nana? Not me. For you two. It is a fabulous idea. I will stay here with Helen and get everything finished. No, no, no, no, no. We couldn't ask you to stay late. - No. - You didn't ask, and I insist. Besides, there're some other things around the house I'd like to do. They say that I have "the touch". what do you say? It has been a while. go! Even if only to walk along the waterfront. There's that holiday food festival down there. Oh, yeah. It will do you good. All right, let's do it. gosh, it feels like forever since we've been down here. how did we let that happen? We've got a lot on our plate. Yeah. We need to make time for this sort of thing, you know? To connect. Maybe bring back the old picnic? on the bench where we met? I don't know if you could say that "we met" there. you tripped me. Okay, well, not a proper introduction, but, in my defense, I was just stretching my legs, so you should've been watching where you were jogging. Well, I'm glad I wasn't, because you had to make sure that I didn't break my face, and the rest... Is history. And that was the moment I understood why people say, "there are no accidents." mm. Back when we had the whole world ahead of us. The whole world is still ahead of us, Laurel. We just got to believe it. You know, there's something I wanted to talk to you about... wait. Could be Nana. Nope. Just my dad, checking on dinner plans tomorrow night. You're still angry. I don't know. You know, all I needed was him to talk about my mom, and then he met Annie and it was like she never existed. Maybe he wants to apologize for that. Oh, I don't think apologizing is in that man's DNA. Maybe he's had some kind of epiphany. Wow, look at you, giving him the benefit of the doubt. Looks like Mrs. Miracle's rubbing off on you, huh? Yeah, I think we could all stand to be a little bit more like Mrs. Miracle. I guess I'm just not ready to forgive him. And you can't force people to move on. They have to do it in their own time. Why don't you go meet up with him and say what you need to say? Yeah. I could do that, and just tell him how I feel one last time, and if he doesn't get it, then... - Yeah. - Yeah. What were you gonna say? Um... I just... I wanted to say how nice it was to see you smiling again, when we were decorating the tree. - Really? - Yeah. let's go find our bench. People-watch. Okay. But no tripping anyone this time. I don't need to trip anyone. I already have my catch. what... In the world? I mean... How? how long were we even gone? Like, a couple of hours, max. I didn't even know we had this much stuff. Well, they did say that they were gonna go to the store to get some more lights, but, boy, did they ever! Yeah. well? What do you think? You two didn't do this by yourselves? oh, heavens, no! We had help! - "Gabe"? - Among others. We did the inside, too. Come see! wow. are you okay, darling? I'm fine. I do that from time to time, too. Take in the memories. I wish it helped. come! We haven't watched jeopardy in a while, and I need to keep this brain sharp. Ha! Please. You're the sharpest of all of us. Ah. Hi. So, who won? Well, Nana got more right, but I got all the daily doubles, so I'll call it a draw. tonight was really nice. It was. Having some alone time. Yeah. Being down on the waterfront. Yeah. The house just feels alive again. And man, these cookies are good. Do not tell Nana I said that, please. No! You can tell her. They made them together, like the best of friends. I know, I have no idea what happened since this morning, to make such a turn. All Nana said was that they realized how much they had in common and they "came to an arrangement". Hey, it's a good thing. It'll take it. Yeah! I feel like nana's starting to wake up a bit. And obviously, Gloria's got her to embrace the holidays again. Yeah, and then some. You know... Maybe we're all coming out the other side of this dark period. Yeah. Maybe. you know, Laurel... Will. We're just starting to feel good again, you know? Let's not do anything that would disrupt that. good morning. Come on in! Good morning. Hello, Helen! We're going ballroom dancing today. wow! Nana? I'm going to change. I certainly can't wear this to go dancing. So is there anyone else we need to get gifts for? Do you want me to pick up something for your father, since you're gonna see him tonight? Oh, no. No, we stopped doing gifts a long time ago. That would just be weird. Got it. And what do you want for Christmas, Mrs. McCullough? Assuming you're on the "nice" list. do not spend a lot of money on me. What if I want to get you something special? All I need for Christmas is for Nana to be okay again. Yeah. She's on her way. Don't worry. I won't go too crazy on your gift this year. Nothing with a comma in the price tag, I swear. Okay. Love you. Bye. they're so pretty. Yes, they are. And my wife would kill me if I spent that much. Can't put a price tag on happiness. Can I help you find something else? No, thanks. I think I'm good. There are sales going on in every section. Very exciting stuff for everyone on your list. Well, if I have any questions, I'll come and find you. You should check out the children's section. It'll blow your mind. They're practically giving things away. It's like... Pow! I don't have children, so... You don't? No. Are you sure? So... I didn't see you in here with your daughter the other day? I don't have a daughter. Wasn't me. You will. I'm sorry, what was that you said? I just said, if you need any help, come find me. The name's mercy. Okay. Helen atwater! I can't believe my eyes! And, contrary to popular opinion, I'm still at 20/20 vision. look at you. And in a dress! Who is this miracle worker that brought miss Havisham out of the house? This is Gloria, my... Temporary helper! Helen said that she wanted to come and see her friends and I was all too happy to oblige. So, let me guess. You're grace... And you're Shirley. And you must be art. I am art! And it is a pleasure to meet you. Any friend of Helen's... Shall we go in? I brought my dancing shoes. how did you know their names? I don't recall mentioning them. Didn't you? Come on. Let's go bust a move, Helen. Let's go. shall we dance? I'm afraid I'm a bit rusty. I'll be gentle. All right. It comes back to you. It's like riding a bike. Which I haven't done since '89, so maybe it's not the best example. I'm sorry I haven't been by since the funeral. Oh. It's okay, art. I know how important Robert was to you. After Margie passed... I didn't want to see anyone. I couldn't take those people giving me that look anymore. I know that exact look. It's mixture of pity and sympathy. I don't need anyone fussing over me. Oh, I hated the fuss. I can get my own plate of food, thank you. exactly. It gets easier. With time. I'm counting on it. hi, dad. Hi. Oh. Oh, thanks. This is nice. Yeah. Um, I'm glad you like it. So... How are you? How's will? - Nana? - Good. Yeah. You know, everybody's... Good. Just hanging in there. Good. That's, uh, good. Let's not beat around the bush, dad. Why don't we just address the elephant in the room? Why am I here? That's what you want to know. Well, I mean, you're here to see clients. There's no client, Laurel. I wanted to see you. You know, that's the first time that you've ever come to see me, without piggy-backing on a business trip? I don't think that's true. I mean, we've spent plenty of time together over the years. One week, during the summer. And I came to you every time. Elina started therapy, and told me I wasn't present during her childhood. You want me to tell you you were a great father? No. No. No, no. I'm... I'm here to say I'm sorry I wasn't. I mean, I was for elina. I'm not quite sure what she's talking about, but I... I didn't do right by you, Laurel. No. You did not. You made me feel replaceable. Like mom was replaceable. Ahem. Here. Open it. I thought this was lost or given away or something. I thought so, too, but I was cleaning out the attic last week, and there it was, behind some boxes in the corner, just sitting there, looking at me. You know, its wonky head, cocked to one side... your mother loved making those things with you. they were... Awful... But there's nothing she loved more. I know. Me too. It's one of my absolute favorite memories of her. I don't have many. It's the strangest thing. I saw it and I just felt like I needed to get it to you. And to apologize for not taking better care with it. With all her things... Her memory. Wow. I just... I feel like I have a part of her that was lost. This means so much to me. Thank you. I'm sorry I didn't know how to be what you needed. I didn't know how to get through the grief myself... How could I possibly know what a six-year-old needed? Nana and pop did. And I'm grateful to them for that. How can I make it up to you? Why don't we start with dinner? Oh, yes. That would be good. and one more thing... If elina thinks that you weren't there for her, hear her out. Her feelings are real. what are you guys doing in here? We're going to the quilting club tomorrow and Helen is going to teach me how to make a proper quilt with these. Among other things, but you'll have to wait till Christmas till you see it. Well, Christmas is only five days away. Oh, well, you know me. That's all I need when I get the gang together. I love that you're getting the gang together again. Hey. How was dinner? It was actually really good. He did want to apologize. - Hmm. - And... He brought me this. No way! The long-lost angel returns home? You're kidding me. These things have a way of turning up. He said that he found it in some far corner of the attic, like it was taunting him, and it helped show him the error of his ways... So maybe mom was right, maybe it is my guardian angel, even without its googly eyes. Let's put her on the tree! Let's do it! Great idea. allow me... - Thank you. - My lady. Kind sir. There we go. An angel in your house, they say, will guide your family night and day. I feel like I read that on a poster in Sunday school. Gloria, will you come to candlelight mass with us on Christmas eve? Nana. Gloria probably doesn't want to be working on Christmas eve. She probably wants to spend it with family or friends? Gabe? There's plenty of time for loved ones. A candlelight mass is an invitation I couldn't possibly refuse. What about you? Will you come? I just... well, I need to just concentrate on the kids' performance, and then I'll worry about Christmas eve. I'm gonna, um, make some tea. Do you guys want any? Uh, I'll help. Okay. Good! Now that I have you alone... I think Gloria... "Mrs. Miracle"... Yeah? Is an angel. Oh! Good. I think she's an angel, too. No, Laurel! I mean, a real live angel... Come to earth. Wow. Think about what you're saying. 'kay? Well, you cannot deny that strange things have happened since she arrived. What things? For one thing, snickerdoodles on the first day? Coincidence? I think not. And she knew all about grace and Shirley and art, and I have never mentioned them to her. Have you? I... No, I don't think so. Maybe will has? And her car! A '56 fairlane? I know, she does have really good taste. Pop's taste! And now your mother's angel has suddenly resurfaced! She called that days ago. Nana. Nana, none of this means what you're saying. She always knows just what we need. Yeah, because she's good at her job. Laurel, open your mind for just a moment. You used to believe. I don't believe in angels anymore, Nana. That's okay. Because I think they still believe in you. so what if your grandmother believes it? I mean, look at her. She's come alive. What's the harm in thinking something a little out there, you know? I just hope that, in her grief, she hasn't lost her grip on reality. No, I think it's actually the opposite. She's getting it back. I mean, she's thinking to the future. Maybe you could do some of that, too? That's not fair, will. it was the most vivid dream. It was like Robert was right there in the room with me. Because he was. In your heart. After mercy passed, I used to talk to her all the time, and I'd like to think she heard all of it. "mercy"? That... That was your daughter's name? That's a... That's a very pretty name. All right, well, I gotta dash off and prep for tonight, and get my classroom ready for winter camp, but it's gonna be quite the show. I'll see you there? If only so I can say "I knew you back when," before the show went to Broadway. See ya. We should get her flowers. You know, even better, I saw this pair of earrings I know she'd love, but I promised I wouldn't spend too much on her Christmas present. Technically, it's not a Christmas present, so it's actually not against the rules. Semantics, but I like it. Why don't we split it? Well, she does so much for everyone else. I would like to do something nice for her. Deal. I'd like to see her smiling again. Sure does look good on you. oh! "a quilt is bits and pieces, joy and sorrow, stitched with loving care." I like mine to tell a story. And what story are we telling here? A story of love. Well, Christmas was always our happiest time, so I'll add that in, while honoring those no longer with us. This is a piece of my daughter Kelly's baby blanket. this is from a pair of Jonathan's footie pajamas. Oh, a scarf I wore, when I rode in Robert's Fairlane. oh, this is his favorite flannel shirt. Mm. it still smells like him. I think it's beautiful... The quilt and the sentiment. And I'll add in... This holiday embroidery. I mean, um... You'll be going back at some point, to wherever it is you came from. Where did you say that was from? Cleveland. And I suppose you're not wrong. Then we'll always remember you with this quilt. Mrs. Merkel, who came into our lives one Christmas and helped us find our way back to ourselves. And I believe Laurel is on the cusp of this also. It's always darkest before the dawn. hi. Did you want to see something in the case? Actually, I'd like to buy those earrings right there, but is mercy around? She helped me the other day. I'd love to get her the commission. I'm sorry. We don't have anyone named "mercy" working here. Are you sure? I was just here. I'm the floor manager, and I don't have anyone by that name on my staff. I could've sworn she said mercy, but maybe I got it wrong. Is it Marcy? Murray? I don't know, Myrna? No. But whoever it was, she clearly gave you great service, and I love to hear that about my employees.

Thank you, guys. I love it. I love it. And I love all of you. You did such a great job. she was meant to be a parent, will. you don't have to tell me that. Don't despair. The child that's meant for you will find you, when you're meant to be together. Well, very well, then. Let's go congratulate her and give her those earrings. Oh. now, that's a neck pillow. "I can't be held responsible for what my face does when you talk." I'm gonna walk around the office like this. all right. Who's next? Will? Okay, here I go. Ready? Yeah, hot. Hot. That one. That one. Ah-hah. Cigars? Tara didn't want to know the gender in advance when Tyler was born, so I bought both, and this was the perfect opportunity to get rid of it. Hey, those might come in handy soon. Hmm? You never know. hey. You all alone in here? Helen is napping. Busy day. We went shopping. And that zumba is no joke. Every inch of my body is hurting. Well, I appreciate you enduring all that pain for her. Thank you for today, Gloria. Are you all right, will? You believe in signs, right? Absolutely! They're all around us, if our eyes are open to them. This is from the office white elephant party today. And then there was this-this salesgirl I had... I-I don't know. I swear, it's like the universe is taunting me. I don't think the universe is capable of that, but there can be messages in our experiences. All the messages I'm receiving are reinforcing all that I want, but can't have. It just feels so unfair. You know, with Jonathan, we were a family. There was so much joy in this house and I am so ready to bring that joy back in. Does Laurel know how you feel? I think I've been pretty vocal about it, and she's been pretty vocal about her feelings. Hey. There's some people caroling down our street and they don't seem to know any of the words, I think we need to join them and rescue them. Very well, then. I'll go get Helen. All right, I'll go get a jacket. Yeah. ♪ o come let us adore him ♪ ♪ Christ the lord ♪ hey. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good, will. Okay. How about the next one is a little bit more upbeat?

Hi! Getting something stronger than you have at home? Yeah, I've got some last-minute shopping to do, so I figured I'd caffeinate myself first. I was just picking up some treats for your grandmother this morning. That's nice of you. Thank you for all that you're doing for her, really. It's my pleasure. In service to others, we're always personally rewarded. Come and sit with me for a moment. Okay. Sure. your seemed to have a very heavy heart the other night during caroling. Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine. As long as nana's good, I'm good. I overheard you and will talking before we went outside that night. You heard him, Gloria. I can't give him what he wants and I wonder if I'm wasting his life. You don't really believe that? We tried so hard, Gloria, for years, and I can't help but feel like there's something wrong with me, like somehow I failed him. None of this is your fault. You say to focus on the joy, right? Look to the future. See the good. I want to do that. I just don't know how to do that. How do you do that? Well, I've only been around for a week or so, but it doesn't take long to see that you take on everyone's burdens... Helen's, will's, your own. You don't have to shoulder the responsibility of everything that goes wrong. That's what family is all about... Weathering the storm together. It seems that will and Helen may be moving into the sunshine. Perhaps you could consider joining them there. I think I have mastered it, and I'll show it to art today. Helen, you've mastered everything, and I can't continue to take your money. You don't need me. You're taking care of yourself. Your wrist is healing. You've got your friends. So, I'll be leaving after Christmas for a new assignment. But what about Laurel? I think she's still a work in progress. I suspect she's on the verge of a major breakthrough. Well... You would know. What does that mean? hello? Laurel. Hi. It's Nancy Swindoll. Hi. Hi. Nancy. How are you? Is everything okay with Jonathan? Yeah! Oh, yeah, um, I'm not actually calling about Jonathan. Look, I'm sorry to bother you, I know it's difficult for you to talk when you're at work, but I tried will and I got his voicemail. No, no, no. I'm actually off today. What's going on? There's a newborn at Seattle general that's ready to be placed. You'd need to pick him up tonight. I'm sorry, Nancy. There must be some sort of mistake. We-we... We aren't fostering again. Oh. Oh, wow. I'm so sorry, Laurel. When I spoke to will last week, he... Um... you know what? My bad. I am so sorry for any misunderstanding and we will just move on to the next family. Yeah. Thanks, Nancy. Sorry to waste your time. Take care. hey. You heard from Nancy? She left me a voicemail, too. Are you angry? I don't know how I feel. It's a baby, Laurel. We have so much love to give that child. I cannot believe that you would put me in that position, to make me choose on the spot like that? Why wouldn't you tell me? I wanted to, but very time I brought it up, you just shut me down. It's like I don't get to have a say in our life. I know. And that's not fair to you at all. But I can't go through that kind of loss again. I just can't do it. I feel like I lose everyone that I love. Babe, you still have me. Always. I'm not going anywhere. I know how much you want to be a father, and I'm so sorry that I can't give that to you. I'm so... Very sorry. Hey. That isn't on you. Maybe not, but the last thing I would want to do is hold you back from having the family that you so desperately want. You are my family, Laurel. But that's not enough. And you should find someone that can give you everything that you deserve. What are you saying? I just think that we've reached a fork in the road, where you go one way and I go another. No, you... You don't get to make that decision for me, for us. It has to be this way, will, because I can't feel like this anymore. Ahem. I'm gonna give you some space... But this isn't over. I love you, will. I hope you know that. and I love you. Forever. You're the only one for me, Laurel. I'm gonna give her some time, but I'm not giving up on her. Love you. love you. I'll see you soon. Laurel? Are you okay? I'm fine. We can make some tea. Gloria is going to stay and help me with prep for Christmas eve dinner. Maybe in a little. Well... You know what I always say... There is no problem that can't be solved over a cup of hot tea. I think that tea might be out of its league this time, Nana. we'll be right downstairs. Okay. sorry about the couch, but Britta can't sleep in the baby's room or we'd all be up all night. Hey, no, the couch is fine. I really appreciate you letting me crash, man. Mi couch-a es su couch-a. Stay as long as you want, buddy. Thank you, Neil. Hey, you know, the holidays... They have a way of kicking everything up... Good and bad. This is gonna blow over. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You know what? I'm gonna get you some of the good pillows. Thanks. hi. Mommy says that your wife is mad at you, that's why you're sleeping over. Something like that, yeah. Do you want to have a tea party? I would love to have a tea party. Oh... There you go. Mommy says that things always seem worse at night, but then the sun comes up. And a cup of hot tea makes everything better, too. You know what, Britta? I think you're right about that. Thank you. Mm! Oh, my goodness, that's good stuff. I know. cheers. hi. Oh, I'm so glad you came down. Are you feeling better? Mm-mm. I just wish I understood why it has to be this way. What way is that? Why do bad things have to happen at all? Why does a child lose their mother at six years old? Why does a mother lose their child, like you did? Why were we given Jonathan, only to have him taken away? Maybe Jonathan wasn't given to you as much as you were given to Jonathan. He's with his mother now. He's okay, and you get to be okay, too, Laurel. But if he's taking up all the space in your heart, another child can't. It's okay to love him and let go of him. I realized that the best way to honor pop's memory is to keep going, to live a full and happy life for him. After mercy passed, someone asked me, if you would've known that you only would have your daughter for 19 years... Would you do it all over again? In a heartbeat. Me too. Yeah. We don't always get to understand the why. It's useless to dwell. But, Laurel, your miracles are out there... For you and will both, in the form of an open door, waiting for you to walk through it. Do miracles happen because we believe, or do we believe because miracles happen? Maybe a little bit of both. thank you. Oh. I'm so lucky I got to be your mommy... sugar? One can never have too much sugar. too true, kind sir. Too true. excuse me? Is this a private tea party or can anyone join? All are welcome. Please. Come join us. Hi, Britta. This is our third tea party in 12 hours. I am completely wired. Sweetie, why don't you come help your mom and I in the kitchen? Make sure you say you're sorry. That's what daddy does. ahem. You look very nice. thank you. I'm so sorry, will. No, I'm sorry, Laurel. You have nothing to apologize for. I do, actually. I was dwelling on the pain, and I shouldn't have asked you to live in that place with me. I only wanted to show you that there were possibilities out there for us. I know. And I love you so much for that. And for your patience with me and for never giving up on me. Never. I'm ready to see the joy again. It's out there for us, Laurel. I hope so. Will you come to candlelight mass with me tonight? Of course. Hey, look. No matter what our future holds, it's you and me. Even if it's just you and me forever... That's okay. You are my family, Laurel. let's go home. Yeah. My tea's cold anyway. hi! Merry Christmas, Mrs. M. Merry Christmas, Tasha. go on inside with your brothers and sisters and get us some seats. oh... I know those two! They were in my class once upon a time. I didn't realize you had so many other children. yeah! Those two are our latest fosters. They've only been with us a couple of months. They're all great kids. They just need a chance, you know? Look how Tasha's thriving! Especially being in your class. Tasha was in foster care? She came to us when she was four, and the adoption just went through in may. Wow. Congratulations. I-I had no idea. Um... We were foster parents a while back, yeah, it's so rewarding, isn't it? I mean, the boys eat everything in sight and the grocery bills are astronomical. If the two of you ever decide to take in an older one, we have hand-me-downs in every size. Well, we should probably head inside. - Yeah. - Get a seat? - Yeah. - Okay. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Do you feel it?

That's how old I was when I... She is adorable and so sweet. Would you like to meet her? Um, I don't think we need to meet her, Nancy. No. but we do need to buy her a bed, 'cause we only have a crib. I hope something's open on Christmas! That is wonderful. Her name is Kelly. Kelly! I think she'll fit right in here. I think so, too. Happy holidays. mom! Dad! Santa came! - He did? - He did!
