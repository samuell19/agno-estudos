[ Sighs ] You know that Hindenburg footage... where people jump to their deaths to avoid a hell fire of burning hydrogen? That bad, huh? Worse. - Ah, well, screw 'em. - You don't understand. My mom was captain of the cheer squad three years running... and president of her sorority. She has expectations. Okay, no offense, but screw her too. Thank you for coming on such short notice, Mr. Grey. Zem-Chem poured a ton of money into this project, Doc. If you've made a breakthrough, I need to know about it pronto. Just tell me one thing. - Can it fix this? - [ Groans ] I don't understand. - What's the biggest problem with plastic surgery, Doc? - Sometimes patients get lost... Wrong! It's goddamn turkey neck!

Listen, kid. Degrees don't mean a squatting shit to me. Sure as hell ain't gonna get you a job. What I want is results. Okay, uh, well, take a look then. Um, just... Right over here.

[ Squeaking ] Are you saying Renew did this? The compound was created to rejuvenate aging epidermal cells, but it's gone so beyond that. [ Kyle ] Yeah, a-a-and here's the really cool part. Come here. Just one second. Um, see, Renew is actually morphing chromosomes. It's aiding replication, so only the healthiest cells undergo mitosis. In other words, it turns ugly... into cute. I have one question. - Will it work on titties? - [ Chuckling ] Oh, we're a long way from Th... Yes, it'll work on titties. [ Laughing ] You're beautiful, Doc! I love ya!
