(BUZZING) CANDYMAN: They will say that I have shed innocent blood. What's blood for, if not for shedding? With my hook for a hand, I'll sp/it you from your groin to your gullet. (WOMAN SCREAMING) CAN DYMAN: I came for you. GIRL: It's the scariest story I have ever heard, and it's totally true. It happened a few years ago, near Moses Lake, in Indiana. Clara was babysitting for the Johnsons, and Billy pulls up on his motorcycle. Now, she wasn't even going out with Bil/y. She was actually going out with Michael for about six months. But she always had the hots for Billy 'cause he was like a bad boy. And Michael was just so nice. So, anyway, she decides that tonight's the night that she's gonna give Billy what she never gave to Michael. Have you ever heard of Candyman? No. Well, his right hand is sawn off and he has a hook jammed in the bloody stump. And if you look in the mirror, and you say his name five times, he'll appear behind you breathing down your neck. You wanna try it? GIRL: So Billy began. He looked in the mirror and he said... Candyman. Candyman. Candyman. Candyman. No one ever got past four. Not here. Go downstairs. I have a surprise for you. (CHUCKLES) GIRL: She looked in the mirror, and I don't know why, but she said his name the last time. Candyman. She turned out the lights... (CLARA SCREAMING) What he saw turned his hair white from shock. Killed her, split her open with his hook, and then killed the baby, too. And Billy got away, but soon after he went crazy. My roommate's boyfriend knows him. So, when did you first hear this story? My friend heard it on the radio. It's true. Sick, huh? The babysitter just roasted the kid, like it was a turkey or something. So, what's the deal? You guys doing a page on serial killers or something? Something like that. Well, that's it. We're done. All right. Thanks. No problem. See ya. See ya. See ya. (BOTH GIGGLE) Seems like they're gettin' younger every day. TREVOR: Does anybody remember the craze for the pet baby alligators? DIANE: When they got too large to keep, people flushed them down the toilet. They live in the sewers now. Some of them are 30-feet long. TREVOR: Where did this happen? DIAN E: Ln Miami. They went blind and albino from living in the dark. (STUDENTS LAUGHING) DANNY: Sir, it wasn't Miami, it was New York. I read it in the paper. Oh, well, then it must be true. (ALL LAUGHING) Why would Danny and Diane both be suffering from the same delusion, in two cities, over 1,000 miles apart? Let's face it, folks. There are no alligators in the sewers. No, it's round the campfire, it's bedtime stories. See, these stories are modern, oral folklore. They are the unselfconscious reflection of the fears of urban society. (BELL RINGING) Thafslunch. The primordial reptile is then transformed into this monster, right? Why? Ah, the dashing professor. The lovely wife. Hello. Helen, you know everybody? The créme de la créme. Harold. Hi. Diane, Daniel, Stacey. Hi. Hello. So, keep up the good work. Thank you for the contributions. Thanks. Bye. Awesome lecture. See you. Bye. See ya. So you wanna tell me about this girl? What's her name? Stacey. She could barely look me in the eyes, Trevor, and I swear she was blushing. Well, I guess that's because she's madly in love with me. You know, all those bursting adolescent hormones. You don't really think... No, of course not. Good. I should hope not. So, what's the matter? Trevor, you promised you wouldn't do the urban legends lecture until next semester. You knew that Bernadette and I were gathering data from the freshmen, so why did you have to ruin it? (SIGHS) Honey, you're my wife and I love you dearly, but you can't expect me to hold up their education while the two of you complete your thesis. I mean, be realistic. I have a curriculum I have to follow here. Yes, I know. Well? So don't be mad at me. GIRL ON TAPE: /fyou look in the mirror and say his name five times, he'// appear behind you breathing down your neck. (KEYS CLATTERING) Can I clean the room? Oh, sure. Don't mind me. GIRL ON TAPE: So Billy began. He looked in the mirror and he said... "Candyman, Candyman, Candyman... " Candyman, huh? Yes, have you heard of him? Mmm-hmm. You doing a study on him? Yes, I am. What have you heard? Everybody's scared of him once it get dark. He live over at Cabrini. My friend told me about him. Cabrini-Green? Yeah, in the projects. I live on the South Side, so I don't know too much about it, but my friend, she know all about it. Her cousin live at Cabrini. They say he killed a lady. Can I talk to your friend? Sure. Kitty? Yeah? What do you want? Lady down here wanna talk to you. All right. She comin'. I'm Helen Lyle. Pleased to meet you. Henrietta Mosely. And this is Kitty Culver. Hello. Tell her what you told me about the Candyman. All I know was there was some lady in a tub, and she heard a noise. Do you remember her name? I think her name was Ruthie Jean. And she heard this banging and smashing, like somebody was tryin' to make a hole in the wall. So Ruthie called 911 and she said, "There's somebody comin' through the walls." And they didn't believe her. They thought the lady was crazy, right? Mmm-hmm. So she called 911 again, and they still didn't believe her. But when they finally got there, she was dead. Was she shot? No. She was killed with a hook. (MIMICS SLICING) HENRIETTA: It's true. Yeah, it is. I read it in the papers. Candyman killed her. Yeah, but I don't know nothin' about that. BERNADETTE: Helen, this is sick. This isn't one of your fairytales. A woman got killed here. Jesus. That's not the half of it. Now, that's Cabrini-Green, not that you'd recognize it today. Yeah, no kidding. I won't even drive past there. Heard a kid got shot there the other day. Every day. Okay, now look carefully at this picture. And then this one. You spot it? No. That's not Cabrini-Green. That's this building, Lincoln Village. My apartment was built as a housing project. No. Yeah. Now take a look at this. Once it was finished, the city soon realized that there was no barrier between here and the Gold Coast. Unlike over there, where you got the highway and the "L" train to keep the ghetto cut off. Exactly. So they made some minor alterations. They covered the cinder block in plaster and they sold the lot off as condos. How much did you pay for this place? Don't ask. (LAUGHS) Now wait till you see this. Here's the proof. The killer, or killers, they don't know which, smashed their way through the back of this cabinet. See, there's no wall there. It's only a medicine chest separating us from the other apartment. Hey, hey, wait! What are you doing? There could be somebody on the toilet. No, the apartment's vacant. Are you sure? Yes. There. Okay. Now take a look. BERNADETTE: That is amazing. (GASPS) What? There's somebody in there. I saw a light go on. There's nobody there. Psych. That's not funny. That was not funny. (LAUGHING) You didn't scare me at all. Yeah, right. Ow. You don't believe all that nonsense anyway, do you? I don't. Do you? No. All right. BOTH: Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman. Oh, you chicken! (LAUGHS) You have to do it five times. Go on. Go again. BERNADETTE: I'm sorry... HELEN: I did it... (CLOCK TICKING) (SOFT THUD) Trevor? (SCREAMING) Oh, Trevor! What? Who were you expecting? (SIGHS) What time is it? It's late, and I'm smashed. Sorry I scared you. What's with the arsenal, Bernadette? We're only going eight blocks. You're the one who got us dressed up like cops. I just said dress conservatively. Yeah, well, we look like cops. Why are you trying to scare me? I'm not trying to scare you, Helen. I just want you to think, okay? The gangs hold this whole neighborhood hostage. Okay, let's just turn around then! Let's just go back, and we can write a nice little boring thesis, regurgitating all the usual crap about urban legend. We've got a real shot here, Bernadette. An entire community starts attributing the daily horrors of their lives to a mythical figure. Now, if Trevor and Archie were in on this, do you think they'd chicken out? In a second. Exactly. (SIGHING) All right. Yo, G, what's up? What's up, man? You wanna wait here for me? No. Well, then let's go. Check them out. HELEN: And lock the car. MAN 1: Hey, now. Whoo! Want somethin', baby? I got it for you. MAN 2: Say, yo, mama. Come over here, baby. Come on, come on. Yo, baby. Which way you goin'? Just going inside. Yeah? (MAN LAUGHING) MAN 1: Y'all can't come up in here. MAN 2: Can't come up in here. Excuse me, y'all can't come up in here. Who you lookin' for? Just going up to see a friend of ours. Sure you're not the police, huh? MAN 3: Look like Five-O to me. Ask blondie where she goin'. Who she goin' to see? Who you goin' to see? Let's take the stairs. Come on. Where you all goin' there? (WHISTLING) Heads up, people! Five-O comin' up the back door! Police! It's okay. They think we're cops. They're not going to follow us. Hang on. Look at this. Oh, this is great. (CAMERA CLICKING) BERNADETTE: "Sweets to..." HELEN: "The sweet." "Sweets to the sweet." Hurry up, Helen. Let me just get the door. (BARKING) Sorry. Jesus, Helen. Here it is. Don't go in there. Come on, come on. Jesus, it stinks. See, I was right. The layout is identical. Which means that the bathroom is over there. Helen... What's the problem? A woman died in there. Leaveit. It's all right. There's nothing to see. (CAMERA CLICKING) God. Wait a minute. This is where he crawled through, right? Yeah. Well, we found it. Let's go. Wait a second. Okay. Hang onto this. What? I'm just gonna go through, and when I get back, we're out of here. You gotta be kidding. Oh, come on. It's just a derelict apartment. What if somebody's packing drugs in there? You're just gonna apologize and give them your card? Huh? All right. Let's listen. HELEN: There's nobody in there. Okay. But hurry up. Be careful. Give me the camera. You got five minutes. Okay. Five. (CAMERA CLICKING) (CAMERA WHIRRING) Damn it. (SIGHS) Bernadette! Sorry. (GASPS) Iran out of film. I've gotta go back. No way. You can't believe what... No way, Helen. We're out of here. (DOG BARKS) Hey, what y'all doin' in there? We're just leaving. You here for the sweet? HELEN: No. We're not cops. We're from the university. Well, you don't belong here, lady. You don't belong goin' through people's apartments and things. My name is Helen Lyle and this is Bernadette Walsh. We're doing a thesis, and we were wondering if we could just talk to you for a few minutes. Here. This is my card. (BABY CRYING) My baby. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. You know, whites don't ever come here, except to cause us a problem. Believe me, that's not what we want to do. (SOFTLY) Let's go. So you say you're doing a study? What you gonna say? That we're bad? Hmm? We steal? We gangbang? We all on drugs, right? We ain't all like them assholes downstairs, you know. I just wanna raise my child good. He's a beautiful little boy. He's all I got. What's his name? Anthony. I'm Anne-Marie. Anne-Marie McCoy. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry we disturbed you. We'll just get out of your way. It's okay. I don't mean to be rude. It's... The white folks that come round here ain't too handshakin' with us, you know? (BABY GURGLES) Hey, what you doin'? HELEN: Let me help you. Oh. Making a mess here, huh? Thank you. Thanks. You got kids? No, but I'd love one. Hey. Got my eye on this one, big time. Yeah. They're not gonna get him. You wanna know about Ruthie Jean? They all been here, you know. Newspapers, cops, case workers. They all wanna know. I heard her screamin'. I heard her right through the walls. I dialed 911. Nobody came. Nobody came. Everybody scared. He can come right through these walls, you know? I'm scared. Scared for my child. They ain't never gonna catch him. Who? Candyman. (PURCELL LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) If they saw something they liked, they'd point. They thought it was rude to point. What did they do? They went... (GRUNTS) Spat over people. It's quite extraordinary. Be nice. I am being nice. I'm being very nice. So how are the two most beautiful graduate students getting along, then? Trevor tells me you've been dabbling in my favorite subject. Well, I can't wait to review your data. I think I can fit you in tomorrow morning. We're not ready yet. That's precisely the moment at which I can be of greatest assistance. Before you disappear down a path to academic Bolivia. (BOTH LAUGHING) TREVOR: I think I've been there. (PURCELL LAUGHING) Actually, Purcell, we're about to bury you. Helen... What? (MOUTHING) I'm sure we're gonna have something for you in a week or so. It's just that we only went to Cabrini today... PURCELL: Ah! Cabrini-Green. Candyman country. Well, if you're after the hook man, Helen, you really must read the paper I wrote about him 10 years ago. You do know the story, don't you? No. (LAUGHING POMPOUSLY) Then how are you going to bury me? The legend first appeared in 1890. Candyman was the son of a slave. His father had amassed a considerable fortune from designing a device for the mass-producing of shoes after the Civil War. Candyman had been sent to all the best schools, and had grown up in polite society. He had a prodigious talent as an artist and was much sought after when it came to the documenting of one's wealth and position in society, in a portrait. It was in this latter capacity that he was commissioned by a wealthy landowner to Capture his daughter's virginal beauty. Well, of course, they fell deeply in love, and she became pregnant. (SCOFFS) Poor Candyman. The father executed a terrible revenge. He paid a pack of brutal hooligans to do the deed. They chased Candyman through the town to Cabrini-Green, where they proceeded to saw off his right hand with a rusty blade. (SAWING) (MAN SCREAMING) And no one came to his aid. But this was just the beginning of his ordeal. Nearby, there was an apiary. Dozens of hives filled with hungry bees. (SCREAMING CONTINUES) They smashed the hives and stole the honeycomb, and smeared it over his prone, naked body. Candyman was stung to death by the bees. They burned his body on a giant pyre and then scattered his ashes over Cabrini-Green. Hello. Anne-Marie ain't in. Are you sure? Yeah. She said you'd be back. (BARKING) What's your name? Jake. Well, listen, Jake, maybe you can help me out. I wanted to find out about that woman who got killed. Do you know anything about that? Her name was Ruthie Jean. I don't know nothin'. Did anybody else talk about it? You know, it's okay to talk to me, Jake, 'cause I'm not a cop. So nobody's gonna get in trouble. I can't say nothin', or Candyman'II get me. Candyman, huh? You scared of him? I ain't scared of nobody. But you're crazy walkin' here on your own. It ain't safe around here. Yeah, I know. But I don't scare too easy either, Jake. You know, you don't have to tell me. You could just show me. And if you show me where Candyman is, I'll make you a promise. It'll be our secret. Unless you're too scared. Somebody building a bonfire? Yeah, for the party. In there. Candyman's in there? My friend Charlie says so. A boy got killed there. Who was he? Ain't sure. Charlie tell me he was weird. He was crazy? No, a retard. (CAMERA CLICKING) His mom was in the store. And the boy needed to go to the bathroom. His mom was takin' her time, choosin' this, lookin' at that. So the boy started moanin'. His mom get mad at him. Sent him across the street. His mom was at the Checkout. She hears her boy screamin'. BOY: (SCREAMING) Mommy! Mommy! There's a big tough guy. He runs over to check it out. (WOMAN SCREAMING) JAKE: Come out of there shakin' and cryin'. He only been in there five seconds. Come out of there and his hair turned white. I mean, it turned white, just like that. Was the boy murdered? Worse. He's lying on the floor in a pool of blood, holdin' himself. (BOY SCREAMING) Mommy! Mommy! They found it floating in a toilet. Can't fix that. Better off dead. Did Candyman do this? Listen, you wait here for me, okay? Okay. (CAMERA CLICKING) Hello? (GASPS) (COUGHING) (BUZZING) (HELEN EXCLAIMS) (COUGHING) Candyman. Oh, excuse me. I'm done here. I'll just get out of your way. Listen, I don't want to interfere with your business. I'm not a cop. I'm from the University of Illinois. I'll just get out of your way. Hey, come on! Let me go! Look, you're not being very smart. My colleagues know where I am and they're expecting me back. Now let me go! Ihear you're lookin' for Candyman, bitch. Well, you found him. We hear you're looking for Candyman, bitch. VALENTO: Step back. Number four, step forward and say the line. We hear you're looking for Candyman, bitch. VALENTO: Step back. Number five, step forward and say the line. We hear you're looking for Candyman, bitch. VALENTO: Step back. Take them out. He's number five. Good work. (SIGHS) How'd you catch him? We swept the place. We start from the top floor and work our way down. That way you can flush them all out. Whole of Cabrini's locked down now. You're very lucky to be alive, Ms. Lyle. Did he kill Ruthie Jean? No question. Killed that poor kid as well. He ran the Overlords. Oh, we knew everything about him. Only reason why we didn't bring him in before because we couldn't find anyone to testify. We can't protect them down at Cabrini-Green, and they knew that. What about the little boy, Jake? We don't need him. We have you. Hey, Jake. Listen, I just wanted to thank you for saving my life. I wanna go home. We'll get you out of here right away, kid. You did good. You said it was our secret. You lied. It still is, Jake. You won't have to go to court. (WHISPERS) Candyman will get me. Candyman isn't real. He's just a story. You know, like Dracula or Frankenstein. A bad man took his name so he could scare us. But now that he's locked up, everything's gonna be okay. Candyman ain't real? No. (DOOR UNLOCKING) Hey! Slow down! You're supposed to be the invalid here. No, it's much better. Look. See? It's much better today. Yeah, it looks great. Come sit down. (CHUCKLES) You haven't eaten already, have you? No, of course not. Okay, good. BERNADETTE: Hey, welcome back. Thanks. Let me see. I'm so glad you're okay. I would've totally freaked. Yeah, but you know what bugs me about the whole thing? Two people get brutally murdered and the cops do nothing. Whereas a white woman goes in there and gets attacked, and they lock the place down. Yeah, I know, but this was a bad guy. You got him put away. That's all that matters. Oh! I've got a surprise for you. What? You're not gonna believe it. The pictures. A friend of mine in the photography department managed to save most of them. I'd written them off. The camera was smashed. That's not all. I've been talking to some publishers, and there's a lot of interest since you made the local section. We're gonna be published. All right. So I'll come over tomorrow at 9:00, and we'll get started, right? Yeah. Okay. (HORN HONKING) CANDYMAN: Helen. Yes? CANDYMAN: Helen. Who is that? Who is that? Helen. I came for you. Do I know you? No. No, but you doubted me. I'm sorry. I have to go. No need to leave yet. But I'm late. You are not content with the stories, so I was obliged to come. (SIGHS) Be my victim. Be my victim. I am the writing on the wall, the whisper in the classroom. Without these things, I am nothing. So now, I must shed innocent blood. Come with me. (ANNE-MARIE SCREAMING) (ANNE-MARIE MOANING) (ANNIE-MARIE SOBBING) ANNE-MARIE: No! (ANNE-MARIE SCREAMING) (SOBBING) Anthony! Anthony! No, no! No! No! Anthony! (CONTINUES SOBBING) Anthony! Anne-Marie? (YELLING) No! You bitch! You bitch! Stay back! Stay back! Where's my baby? Where's my baby? No! My baby! You murderer! You... No! Stop! Please, stop! Stop. (SCREAMING) Now, stop! Stop! Police! Open up! All right, hold it right there! Back away! Now! (SCREAMING) Look out, look out! (HELICOPTER HOVERING) Remove your sweater. (SOBBING) Drop it and slide it over to me. Take off your brassiere. Can I please take a shower? (GROANS) Oh, God. Drop it, slide it over to me. Lift up your arms. Lift your left breast. Your right. Remove your underwear. Can I please speak with Detective Valento? Remove your underwear. Frank. Ms. Lyle, you're under arrest. Do you understand? Please let me explain. Do you understand? Yes, but... You have the right to remain silent. Do you understand? This is crazy. I was attacked. Respond to the question! I understand. At approximately 10:00 p.m., Anne-Marie McCoy returned to her apartment. She discovered her dog with its head cut off. She cried for assistance, at which point you attacked her with a meat cleaver. You were still in possession of this weapon when the arresting officers came to her aid. DETECTIVE: Where's the baby? I don't know. You're sick. VALENTO: Before I ask any further questions, would you like to have counsel? (BANGS TABLE) Yes or no? (STUTTERING) I would like to make a phone call. (RINGING) (ANSWERING MACHINE CLICKS) TREVOR: I'm sorry, we can't take your call. Please leave a message after the tone. Trevor, are you there? Pick up. It's an emergency, Trevor. Pick up the phone! I've been arrested. I'm at the 18th District. Can you please come pick me up? That's it. Do you know what time it is? 3:00 a.m. (DOOR SLAMMING) (KEYS JINGLING) (BABY COOING) (ANNE-MARIE WAILING) (DOOR OPENS) Oh, God. (CROWD CLAMORING) There's gotta be another way out of here. ATTORNEY: Cover her face. Don't say anything. Just have to walk to the car. TREVOR: Okay? That's it. All right. Here we go. You'll be fine. Stick with me. REPORTER: There she is! There she is! Just keep your head down. (ALL CLAMORING) All right, people. Back off. Back off. We have no comment. Absolutely no comment. Nothing to say. We have absolutely nothing to say! No comment! My client has not been charged with a thing! FEMALE REPORTER ON TV: Some information has indicated that baby Anthony was abducted and may still be alive. The blood may have come from the dog. A suspect was released this morning after questioning, and I guess we'll just have to follow this one as it... Well, at least they didn't mention your name. That's good. Now, they haven't charged you because they think they'll find the body. Which means, I'm afraid, they're shooting for murder one, but I don't think they have a chance. Do you think I did it? No, nobody believes that. But it's crossed your mind? ATTORNEY: Is there anything, any detail, however small, that you can recall that would help us substantiate your version of events? I blacked out. I don't know what happened. I just woke up in that place and there was blood everywhere. Can I get you anything? Are you sure? Look, honey, I was supposed to go over to the campus and pick up some work. I'm concerned about leaving you alone, though. I'll only be about 20 minutes. Trevor? Where were you last night? I was here. I was fast asleep. I thought you were with Bernadette. Look, honey, I'm gonna stand by you. We're gonna get through this, okay? I'll be right back. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) Believe in me. Be my victim. Come on. Please. Do you believe in me? Keep away from me! I have the child. Allow me to take you, or he will die in your place. No! Your disbelief destroyed the faith of my congregation. Without them, I am nothing. So I was obliged to come. And now I must kill you. Your death will be a tale to frighten children, to make lovers cling closer in their rapture. Come with me and be immortal. (GROANING) Helen? Bernadette. Bernadette, go. Helen? Helen, honey, it's... He's here. Bernadette. Go! Helen! Helen? Go on! Get out! Oh! (SOBBING) Oh, no, no, no. (SLASHING) (BERNADETTE SCREAMING) (CAN DYMAN GRUNTING) (SLASHING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Trevor...

Hold me, Trevor, please? (BUZZING) (POLICE RADIO CHATTERING) CAN DYMAN: Why do you want to live? If you would learn just a little from me, you would not beg to live. I am rumor. /tis a blessed condition, believe me. To be whispered about at street corners. To live in other people 's dreams, but not to have to be. Do you understand? (BABY CRYING) HELEN: Please, God, don't let him kill the baby. Trevor! Trevor? Trevor! Where are you going? No, you can't leave me here! I can't defend myself! (GRUNTING) No. What do the good know, except what the bad teach them by their excesses. Murderer. Allow me at least a kiss. Just one exquisite kiss. (CRYING) Murderer! Help! Listen, he's under the bed! Bring me 1,000 mills. Listen. He's here. He's under the bed! No. DonT (BABY COOING) (DOOR OPENS) (HELEN COUGHING) She's coming around. Morning.

Clyde, open it up. (DOOR BUZZING OPEN) What the hell are you all doing back there, huh? A little reading? Huh? MAN: Freak. Dr. Burke? DR. BURKE: Yes. Ms. Lyle, I'm Dr. Burke. I'd like to speak to my husband. I'm sure we can arrange a visit. A visit? Have I been committed? Do you really think these restraints are necessary? Helen, this is a writ of detention from the state attorney's office. Now, for the past month... Month? Yes. We've been stabilizing you on a heavy dosage of Thorazine. You probably remember very little, or nothing. Get me my attorney. I'm working for your defense. We have to assess your ability to stand trial. Helen, you've been charged with first-degree murder. Why don't you tell me what happened in your apartment? (HELEN GRUNTING) The night you were admitted, did the killer appear to you? Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Help me! (GRUNTING) He's here! He's under the bed! I don't understand. Help! Please! He's here! Help me! Help me! Please! He's under the bed. He's under the bed... That's not possible. MAN: Bring me 1,000 mil/s. Bernadette.

Scared of something? (SCOFFS) I hate the color scheme. What were you gonna do, Trevor? Wait till I got out before you told me? Helen. You knew I was never coming out, didn't you? I think we should call the hospital. Okay. (DIAL TONE) Go on. Go on. Is that what you wanna do? (SOBBING) Call them. (SOFTLY) I'm not a murderer. I'm not... Trevor, you were all Ihadleñ.

Do you fear the pain, or what is beyond? Both. The pain, I can assure you, will be exquisite. As for our deaths, there is nothing to fear.
