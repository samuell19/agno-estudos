I'm out of breath. Arms! Present arms! Mmm. Hello. [chuckles] No, I'm not at home. I'm doing an adventure challenge. [chuckles] [Claude] You can imagine this battlefield, with grandstands on the right seating 60,000 people, at the end 40,000 people standing. From the left the French will come up to attack the English, who will be protected by a farmhouse that we'll reconstruct. They'll come down to face the French, but of course the English will be attacking on horseback. We'll have 300 cavalrymen, who will attack the French troops, so it will be a huge event. We'll obviously have security people, ambulances. We'll have smoke grenades, cannons. 3,500 kilograms of gunpowder will be used in this historical reenactment. There's no doubt that Napoleon is the most important role, and we have two reenactors who can play that role. They are Mark Schneider and Frank Samson. It will be the role of their life. We'll see who wins the ballot. Long live the Emperor! Attack! [quacking] [commander] Attention! At ease! Attention! Forward march! Brave soldiers of the Great Army! I am proud of you! The enemy of France has declared war on us! The war is not yet won. So I ask you to be strong and vigilant, and to continue to fight as brave and courageous soldiers. We will soon gain a total victory and an end to this war! Long live France, and long live the Great Army! [all cheering] [Schneider in English] An experience in which it echoes in my mind, as I was thrust into the role of Napoleon upon my gray horse. Soldiers presenting arms, all crying out, "Vive l'Empereur!" "Long live the Emperor!" And I was the Emperor going down that hill. Uh, the crowd of spectators was all around me. It was a surreal moment. For a few seconds, I was Napoleon. [Lancaster] There's an expression that man has the cat, so that he knows what it's like to touch the tiger. What people in reenactment are trying to do is to touch the tiger. History you can't touch. History is not there. It's gone. It's ephemeral. It's, it's not there. But is it possible to find it? [in French] Shoulder arms! [Lancaster in English] In my old school, I hated history. It was boring. Kings and generals and dates and places, and forcing questions on me, um, that... I didn't know the answers, I didn't really want to know the answers, because they weren't my questions. Reenactment helps you to start to ask your own questions. How did they go to the toilet in the past? How did Queen Victoria go to toilet? How did Cleopatra go to the toilet? And what were the changes in between the two? When did it happen and why? And that's just one question. Um, but you can ask that question about every aspect of life. And then you're studying history. Hopefully, it's not just toilets. If that's it, that's it. [music drowns speech] We are not tourists, but we are traveling in time. [shouts] That went pretty well! [man 2] That's a question that we have all the time: do you use live ammunition? I said, "Yes, that's why there are only 40 of us here." Yesterday there were 45, but... [in French] ♪ Let them through ♪ ♪ The French are in Lorraine ♪ ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Let them through ♪ ♪ They've had enough trouble ♪ ♪ The proud Dragons of Noailles... ♪ [Simon] Will you be seen in your documentary? I'd like to know why you're interested in making a documentary on reenactment. It's about a passion for history. -Them, too? -Yes. -It started like that. -What? A passion for history. Great! [laughter] [man 3] If you had an obstacle like this, and a man took ten seconds to pass, the sapper would clear it, and off you'd go. Napoleon won a lot of his battles with his soldiers' legs. What interests me in historical reenactment is to understand why these guys could go through what they went through and follow the Emperor to the very end, because he was leading many of them to their deaths. The Empress doesn't want me to be political. I'd have really liked to win back the throne. It's important to realize that the good of the people doesn't lie in the screams of the masses. It lies in the heart of the Prince. I don't think that the law of the greatest number is the best. Once again I'll vote for the Emperor tomorrow. Even though he's not a candidate, I'll still vote for him. And then time will pass and then... When I get to heaven, if the Emperor isn't there, it means it's not heaven. Here's the border sign with the secret service agent waiting for us. That's normal. The Empress is with the cat. You're almost in the territory of the Empire of Basse Chesnaie. The border with France is right there. This is the Boulevard of Annexation, which is the northern limit of the empire. The law courts are over there. For example, they're deliberating at the moment. On the whole, they're not very friendly. [quacking] Go on! Machado Boulevard and Napoleon Square, and this is Independence Square. That is Grève Square. [clears throat] The place for capital executions. You need them. It was a Samson who executed Danton, Robespierre, unfortunately, Louis XVI. But the profession had no openings, so I did something different. But... [Schneider in English] Who is Frank Samson? He is another gentleman who portrays Napoleon. Has done so at many events. I had the honor and pleasure of meeting him, I believe, for the first time in 2008, oddly enough, at the battlefield at Waterloo, where I was portraying Napoleon. Frank was portraying a French heavy cavalry general. But he also has a historical organization, which makes uniforms, brilliant uniforms, fantastic ones. I have never had the pleasure or honor of going to his home or his kingdom. The Kingdom of Frank, if I am not mistaken, that's what it's called. We're both basically doing the same thing, and that is portraying the great man Napoleon at these various events, and doing our best to portray him in the best light. Traditionally, if a man says he is Napoleon, he's crazy. [Schneider] Of course, I did disguise myself, but it was as a merchant. Can you imagine mistaking me for an Englishman? You would overcome! You would triumph in the end, just as I did! Yet again, they say to me, "I'm sorry, monsieur..." God bless you all, my dear friends, and God bless this great nation, of the United States of America! [Lancaster] Mark, his job is to represent people from history, like an actor. He makes history more interesting. You can get stories from the soldiers of Mark walking in a room, walking through the bivouac... and the men know. It's not the uniform, it's not the costume, it's the man. He has a charisma. He has a personality. In front of the public, it is almost impossible to get a photograph of him with his face in a funny position. Me, the number of photographs I get of me... where I'm... Him, never. Complete control. It's his job. Well, everything would change in 2005, because I would receive a phone call from a man in Belgium, who was part of the Waterloo Committee: [in French accent] "Monsieur Schneider, I would like you to come to Belgium to portray Napoleon on the battlefield." I hung up on him. I thought it was one of my friends playing a joke on me. A few short days later, they officially invite me to come to Waterloo to be Napoleon on this actual battlefield. I walked down the stairs and there's hundreds of reenactors gathering there. The cavalry are all amounted, my horse is fully prepared for me, and I mount up, and I begin this magnificent journey of becoming Napoleon in Europe itself. It was a success, really, because he was really appreciated by the reenactors. He was really appreciated by the press, by the public. His career is on the road in 2005. Immediately, he has a lot of people around him, who encourage him to do more events. [Schneider] And as I did more and more events, my popularity grew more and more, because of this new way, in which we were interpreting history. Really becoming Napoleon for the weekend. [Lancaster] When you can make grown men cry, you're doing something good. But Mark never forgets he's Mark Schneider. He's not being the Emperor for him. He's being the Emperor for other people. He's painting a picture. [in French] Right. I'll put this here. In fact, it all started with a love of military things. The apogee of French uniforms was the First Empire. In the beginning, what I liked was making mannequins, putting uniforms on mannequins, like a figurine-maker, but I did full-scale models. There's a whole science of uniform, because a uniform can be read. A uniform gives information about itself, and I have a reputation for being particularly meticulous about the accuracy of uniforms, the colors and the ribbons. This is the perfume the Emperor wore in daily life. So in reenactments I am meticulous to the point of wearing this perfume when I get dressed, which is called Farina, and was worn by the Emperor at the time. I don't like the current period very much. I prefer the First Empire. People say that the time machine doesn't exist. That's false. It's very easy to go back in time. There's a little bit of a soldier in reenactors. There has to be. It's a military world. When you're researching to recreate an object or a uniform, you discover historical elements. Little details of history, but in the end it's all these pieces that go to make up history. I was born too late. Here we are. Empire Costume. I like to be on the edge. You never quite know where you stand. That's why I often say when I'm in uniform, "I'm the real one." There's been a lot of geological movement. Yeah. Oh, well... -Do you want to fill up your water? -Yes. [indistinct singing] It tastes like wine. [in English] Tastes like wine. [belches] [grunts] [in French] What a beverage! [man 4] We're at an altitude of about 1,0000 meters. There are no major difficulties. We just have to walk. [laughs] We just have to walk. [man 5] Is there anyone to fuck? Nobody to fuck? [laughter] A goat? Can someone give us some bacon? -You don't really know your sergeant yet. -Tell me you didn't pay for this! -You bet. I paid 54 euros for all this. -No! I swear. [indistinct chatter] [laughter] [chainsaw whirring] 200 years afterwards. Thank you. [music drowns speech] All right? Let's go. It's raining so hard! It's raining so hard, and we're under cover. And back then, 200 years ago, they were out in it, and they had no waterproofs. They had no clothes to change into, no shelter. At night they had to manage the best they could. They were soaked to the bone. I'm playing a sapper. I was told, "You're Mariolle." Mariolle was the first sapper of France. He was the ultimate sapper, the very best. But I'm not Mariolle. I'm not half the man he was. I'd like to meet him, and ask him what he thinks about it, because I'm not sure he'd really like it. You know what I mean? We almost never talk about the men who were in the Great Army. [whistles] This guy's cool. Bloody hell. Idiot! Where am I? It's all about Napoleon and a few marshals. The soldiers themselves are never really honored. But by doing reenactments, I hope that I'm maybe paying homage to them. By being as coherent as possible, and not fooling around too much. [band playing] [Schneider in English] After I came home, I was already being invited to other events, in Germany, in Russia, all over the place, for me to portray Napoleon. [Nelis] A lot of people were making him... like a God, you know? [Schneider] Each event appeared to be better than the next. I had a staff now to work with me. I gathered more and more friends. [Nelis] The changes were so quick. In 2006, he was not the same man. In 2007, it was another man. His suggestion was completely crazy. He has a corps. He has his own État Major, all the time in front of him. [Schneider] My friends coined it being a rock star. [in French] Long live France, and long live the Great Army! [soldiers] Long live the Emperor! [in English] Popularity grew to such an extent that I was having difficulties getting out of a car because people wanted to get a picture, or they wanted my autograph. It almost seemed surreal, it almost seemed ridiculous, but I was just pleased with the popularity. [Nelis in French] The Waterloo bicentenary will be the biggest reenactment of the Empire period ever seen. Obviously, the choice of Napoleon, as well as Wellington or Blücher, is very, very important. Of course there's the physical resemblance, which is essential. Then there's the quality of the uniform, because uniformology is something very important for us in Waterloo. Thirdly, there's recognition among the reenactors. We deliberate on a regular basis. Napoleon definitely arouses passions. We have a preference for the two frontrunners. Mark Schneider is a Napoleon who lives in the United States, and Frank Samson is a French Napoleon. We're going to announce our decision in early 2015. Who's that? Who's that, Martin? [in English] You can take the most ignorant person in the world, and say, "Name me three battles." Waterloo is going to be one of them. Take a silhouette of a man wearing a coat and a bicorne, and take it to someone and say, "Who's that?" They don't say Nelson, do they? It's Napoleon. I'm just amazed that, um... Belgium doesn't understand that this is the 200th anniversary, of something which is culturally... vital for almost all of the world. But the attitude from Belgium is to see it as being something small for Belgians. Who is Napoleon? Well, I think they don't care. So they will do whatever is easy. And the immediate reaction is, "Fff, take a Frenchman." Portraying Napoleon at the 200th anniversary of the battle of Waterloo would be a role of a lifetime. My mother often says that she does not know a moment in my life where I was not fascinated with Napoleon and his times. When I was two or three years old, I had a French cousin come visit the United States, and she brought with her some toy soldiers, and one was Napoleon. And I became fascinated from that moment. Many times, kids would make fun of my large nose, and I recall even my mother saying, "They're just jealous, because the only people who have big noses are the Kings of France, or the Emperors of France." [Samson in French] Well, he always has a magnificent profile. It's a bit of a shame about his teeth, but it's not a major problem. Mark's uniform is nice. It's well cut. But the medals aren't right. The ribbon of the Iron Crown is the wrong color. He's missing the two rosettes. That's bad. His Legion of Honor is a type I from before 1806. It's not a mistake, but the Emperor tended to wear a type II or a type III. [Schneider in English] Frank is not being malicious about it. Certainly, we're both vying for the same role. What I have discovered that has been said in some press, is that because I am American, I should not be portraying Napoleon. Yes, I am an American citizen, but my mother is French. J'ai deux patries: la France et les États-Unis d'Amérique. I have two countries, France and the United States of America, and I love them both deeply. [in French] Napoleon must be played by a Frenchman. There can be no discussion about it. Ask the English to have Wellington played by a Swiss. You'll see what they think of that. [in English] I believe I was quoted as having an Anglo-Saxon accent, which I found very interesting, but, again, as stated, Napoleon spoke French with an accent. [in French in an English accent] "Napoleon was a great man." It's just not possible! [in English] People get behind politicians just like people get behind Napoleon. Reenactment is like a miniature microcosm of society as a whole. If you get a bunch of people together, they will have different opinions, and then they will start forming groups, and then they will fight. That's how wars start. At Waterloo, I know who I'll follow, which will be Mark. My best-case scenario would be Frank is Napoleon and Mark is there as backup. Whatever is he's got, if you could sell it and bottle it, you'd be a millionaire. [in French] He had some encouraging words for the troops earlier. No, he'd be a good emperor. Yeah. I liked Frank Samson. [in English] Good luck, Frank. [man 6] When you're interested in history, you reach a point where you absolutely want to live that life as they lived. Just to feel something else than simply reading a book, or getting, you know, stories told by others or that's it. You want to have your own feeling about what it was, I think. That's what we're looking for. You told me something interesting. Yeah, I had an experience at the Battle of Leipzig. Note this. I've done the reenactment a couple of times now, and the first time I went was in 1996, and somebody handed me a gun that was actually on the battlefield at the time, and I had these fantastic flashes in my mind. I don't know if it was my imagination that was going a bit crazy, but all I could just see were soldiers everywhere, firing, firing, firing. [plays drum] [horn honking] [indistinct chatter] [Schneider] On Christmas Eve, 2008, I was involved in an accident. I had been drinking and I hurt someone. I hurt someone very bad. My life and other people's lives changed forever that evening. In the weeks, the months to come, I would be in and out of the courtrooms, finding out what was going to happen next with my life. Of course, first and foremost in my life is my son. What was to become of him if I was to go to prison? Not knowing if I was going to be able to be there for him. That really killed me. I was given the sentence of five years in weekend increments, so two days a week I would go to jail. [in French] If we talk about Waterloo 2015, they need absolute reliability. The person has to be there. If there's any risk related to that, it may be a factor. [Schneider in English] The show must go on. I saw the new Napoleons that came on the scene, specifically that of Frank Samson. They needed a new Napoleon, so whomever was able to fill that gap, the show was theirs. [interviewer in French] Don't you think Mark could make a comeback? No. It's impossible. [man 7 in French] Behold the legendary figure in his gray coat and black hat. Let's give him a big hand. The Emperor! The Emperor has just arrived in Golfe Juan. Bertrand, the soil of France. I'm glad to be back. Soldiers! During my exile I heard your voices. Your general, called to the throne by choice of the people, is returned to you. Come and serve under the flag of your chief. His existence depends on yours. Victory will come in double-quick time. The eagle will fly from bell tower to bell tower, until it reaches Notre-Dame. Then you will be able to show your scars with pride. You will be the liberators of the fatherland. [crowd] Long live the Emperor! I created the Legion of Honor to reward the bravest among you. Sapper, from this moment, you are immortal. I'm proud of you. Wear this ribbon with pride. It's been a while since we met. [crowd] Long live the Emperor! [Schneider speaks French] [in English] "You write to me that it's impossible? I say the word is not French." In 2014, I petitioned to travel again, and it was granted. All the while knowing that I needed to be back in time to serve my time on the weekend. One reenactor cried out to me, said, "The Emperor has returned." It even gives me goosebumps to hear it now. I'm very happy to see you in le maison. It's good to be back. It's good to be back. [indistinct chatter] [speaks French] [laughter] [in French] Unfortunately, it's too late. Mm. The buds and the flowers are over. What's the name of this flower? Is it two years since you were at our house? Yes. -Two long years. -Yes. The war. [she laughs] -It's the war. -I know. Look at that. You take the D20 like this, and there you have the D120. The path goes down and arrives at the bottom, right in Les Robines. -There. -Right. -We arrive up here. -Probably. [man 8] Where the mule fell down with the gold coins. -And you found the gold coins? -Oh, my God, I've looked! [raucous laughter] -It's this way. -Come on, guys. Let's go! Paris is this way. [indistinct chatter] -Long live the Emperor! -Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! [all] Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Thank you. [Schneider in English] These friends, these reenactors, these soldiers remain so loyal to me, despite the trials and tribulations of life, and still, despite everything else, wanted to have me back and play the role of the Emperor once again. [in French] A boyfriend perhaps? -You know I got a cold because of him. -Ah. -Yes. I was in the greenhouse. -Is it true? Really? I was in the greenhouse. -My respects. -Thank you. [she chuckles] I hope that everybody is enjoying what they're seeing. That people can learn from the life of Napoleon and Josephine at their home, at Malmaison. I would hope the Waterloo Committee is learning from this, and will make their event even better. If they decide to choose me as Napoleon again, it would be a great, great honor to do so, but we'll have to wait and see. Many ways like Napoleon's return from Elba, his first island of exile, because I haven't been to an event in two years, I'm so very welcome here, right in the center of France, right in Paris. It's magnificent. [Samson in French] I think we all have our own personality, and our own concept of reenactment, but there's always the same passion, the passion for the Emperor. I'm not fanatical about Napoleon, and everything he did. I like the experience of the life of a soldier or a civilian of that time. That's how we get into the mindset, immerse ourselves, if you like. It's great to experience the fatigue, the feeling, the impression that it gave, at least once in my life. -[laughs] To make the Route... -Or die. [laughs] No, not to die. We're going to die on 18th June. -We die at Waterloo. -All together! -No, we win at Waterloo. -We win at Waterloo before we die. This year we win. We've lost for 200 years, but not this year. We're going to win! The English are really rotten, aren't they? At last a good word in your mouth. -At last? -Yes. -Right... -We'd better... I think we should continue having a good time. -What do you say? -I agree. I've researched my genealogy a bit, and I found an ancestor who received the Legion of Honor in 1804, and it made me think. I appreciate having maybe the same experience as he did. And in Golfe Juan when the Emperor gave me... What did he experience to...? -Are we leaving? -Five horsepower. -Steam power. -Yes. [vehicle approaching] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] Forward march! [camera shutter clicking] [colonel] Her Majesty, the Empress! [camera shutter clicking] [Lancaster in English] Frank Samson? If you look at what he says, "I will be Napoleon until 1815, and then I'll go and do something else." So, it's... What is it? A temporary hobby? Something.... You know, a little diversion? I'm going to do kung fu this week, and then I'll be Emperor the next week? And the week after that, I'm going to buy myself a bicycle. He's not a reenactor. He's not a soldier. He's not a historian. He's carnival. [soldier 1 in French] Franky, how much did Lancaster pay you to have me killed? [laughs] -5,000. -5,000? The bastard! For the journalists, we should have asked for war reporters, because they would have at least gone out in the field. Instead, we have couch reporters. These guys are waiting for us at the pub. -I can tell you this footage is awesome. -Yeah? I've got you all in a line. Put your camera down. I'm filming. Shit! -Hello. -[woman 1] Hello. -[man 9] Do you want a drink? -No, I'm all right. -Water. -You've got water? Yes, I have water. I'll fetch you a bottle. -Is Napoleon behind you? -We haven't seen him. -Didn't you see the riders? -Yes. He had to get off his horse. He wasn't very well. Didn't you see there was a horse without a rider? -He was riding while you're on foot? -We're used to marching. -Ah. -You've been in training. Training goes out the window with these boots. They're genuine. [in English] Um, I know that yesterday the cold got to him. So he may have just felt that today was long enough. You have to, you have to be in shape for this kind of weather. [soldier 2] At what time is your flight? [Schneider] I have to look at my paperwork. Air France is still on strike. -OK. -[speaks French] Ah, yes. Because, well, I was aiming that you become godfather of my... -For the christening of... -[laughs] I arrived on a Friday morning, and I departed on Monday, thinking that I was going to be in time, plenty of time to get to the jail to report. Due to circumstances out of my control, the plane arrived late, and I was late in reporting, so thus we had petition the courts to say that this was out of our hands, but they, in turn, said if this ever happens again, there will be much more trouble for you. Mark's biggest punishment is his own sense of guilt... which is huge. What, five, six years of punishment? When does it end? [Bazatte in French] I'm not talking about the grenadiers who were marching, but the people living in the villages. If you read old books, they had good recipes. They ate all fresh food. Yes, but I'm talking about the people marching. They didn't have fresh food all the time. In every house there was a fireplace with a big pot and a sort of stew in it. That was all they ate. Can you put yourselves in the place of the guys who were here 200 years ago? I think about them. I think about them but I can't really get beyond that. -We think about them. -They were strong. I'm 1.90m tall and I weigh 100kg, but I think I'm small compared to what they were. Because they had power. They were small, but they were country people. Anyway, it's good to do this. -I'm happy for you. -Yes. [band playing] [man 10] Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! [in English] You should not drive your troupe to this point. He was in hypothermia. You know, we really pulled him down from the horse and stopped him from falling into a heap. I would rather that he would stop at noon and say, "I'm having a nice lunch"... and then he can look imperial, and motivate us rather than us saying, "Oh, my goodness, he's, he's human after all. He's not Superman." And we have to believe that the Emperor is Superman. If the Emperor is lost, what the fuck are we doing there? [indistinct chatter] [speaks French] L'Empereur? -No. -No? Uh... Maybe with the guard. Um, maybe with the chasseurs. Um... Here, right? I don't know why he is absent. It's disappointing he wasn't at the parade. I agree. -Yeah. -He's planning his next campaign. That's it. My biggest fear is it will be canceled. Because the problems are so great. They're not going to be able to handle it. [in French] Right wheel! March! [indistinct chatter] -Carry on. -Stay close. It's going down the drain. Halt! [in English] Uh, you got to keep elbow-to-elbow contact with the man next to you. Bring the butt of your gun in, Tom! [in French] You've got to keep contact with the man next to you. [overlapping chatter] Squad, two steps forward. March! Squad, face front! [indistinct chatter] Long live the Emperor. You really should choose better places. This is lousy. This is bar-room journalism. It's really ugly here. There's nothing worse. Can't you walk just a little way? [in English] You have no legs to walk, just on the moon time? [in French] You shouldn't be filming this. I can show you footage to make you cry. [in English] We can show where we went. We make a nice picture. Not here! [in French] You're filming in shadow. You haven't got good light. [in English] It's shit. That you do is shit. Stop it! [Lerouge] 200 years after. Is very important. You-You must... understand this. This is difficult. Uh... During reenactment it's for you to, uh... [speaks French] Feel, feel how, um, history is. When you read a book, in your living room, with whiskey... you feel nothing. Here you feel the... It's cold. You feel the wind. It's, it's very important. You know what I say? -[director] Yeah. I understand, yeah. -OK. [Lerouge in French] Why do you love a girl? For us, it's the same thing, except it's not a girl, it's history. What we like is passing it on, giving. The number of people who have honked at us on the road, who have encouraged us. You see? It makes me emotional. [Lerouge in English] If I know you do a movie where I am a clown... Or... You understand that? ...I take the plane and I go to the United States. Take you, and you are... [in French] We've done a few stages. We're starting to say... [In English] What do you mean he has shoes, which are pretty much like the ones they have in the army. Oh. The sad life of a grenadier. Forced to drink at night and march in the day. [in French] March! [indistinct singing] [drum, piccolo playing] Make way for the Emperor! [in English] Mark Schneider left this morning. Yeah, yeah. He couldn't get a flight, could he? Yeah, he had to leave today. And so the big question is, you know, that everybody is asking, should Mark Schneider or Frank Samson be Napoleon for Waterloo? Of course, yeah. Well, I'd say Samson got defeated by Delilah, didn't he? Remember Samson with his hair? -That's true. -Yeah. Whereas Schneider... What was Schneider in? He was in Blue Thunder, wasn't he? Schneider was a bad motherfucker. Schneider killed Jaws. Do you remember? -No. -Schneider killed Jaws. Yeah, it was Rob Schneider. You've never seen the film? [overlapping chatter] [laughter] What do you think? I'm for Mark, anyway. Yes? But he is representing a more younger Napoleon perhaps. Mark has a charisma. He's smart. Very smart. I don't know much about Frank Samson. He's just another name. He does it when Mark Schneider's not here, you know. That's the way I see it. A lot of people say the positive thing of Frank Samson is that he's French. Mark Schneider isn't. But I don't think it's such a big issue. Reenactment is to bring different nations together. It doesn't matter where you come from. It's a question of what you look like. And what you sound like and the way you treat others. Mark does it very well. But I wonder what would happen if you put in a straw vote to all the men, and said, "Who would you follow?" I would say about 75% would be for Mark. -He's been invited to many more events. -And big ones. -Big ones? -He was Napoleon in front of Putin. -It's not so important, is it? -It's not so important? Um... Important is the soldiers. We could do Waterloo without the Emperor, but we couldn't do Waterloo without the soldiers. Mark Schneider! [laughs] Do you care? Do I care? Of course I care! Me, too. [shouting, clamoring] [in French] It's very important that everyone who registers for a group is first approved by the group leader. We'll send out... [man 11] I call upon someone who I won't name, because that would give it away. [in English] One mistake can change your life forever. Can ruin someone's life forever. Can ruin your family's life forever. Because of this horrible mistake, I have destroyed my dream of portraying Napoleon on the battlefields of Europe. [indistinct chatter] [Samson in French] For the organizers, it created a certain interest. Who would they choose? Tonight was the official announcement. But we've all had our schedule since... The schedule, the time I have to arrive, where I'm to put up my tent, etc., was all planned eight months ago. It's part of the communications package. But Napoleon was a great communicator. [in English] I have to admit that we are happy with the decision of Mark not to participate, because of his image. Uh... Imagine that-that the-the press would relay that Napoleon of Waterloo, uh, went to jail. It would be a disaster. [in French] The irony is that I'm a lawyer specializing in this kind of cases... and here it would be trivial. These Americans are crazy. [laughs] What he was accused of was trivial. [in English] He's not sitting in a comfy chair watching television. Uh, you know, he's in a box. Four walls and nothing. Try doing that every week of your life. Horrible. [Schneider] You can take two directions. You can cry over it and say this isn't fair, and be miserable, and make everyone around you miserable, or you can go in the complete opposite direction, and try to better yourself, better the situation, do what you can. It's no longer just you. What's more important, it's your family, it's my son, I have to set a good example, no matter what. I have to stop other people from making the same mistake. ♪ The adversity does not bother me, just as it didn't bother Napoleon. ♪ ♪ Where there is a will, there is a way. ♪ ♪ I will not let obstacles get in my way, but I will strive to overcome them. ♪ -[in French] Look at that! -First time! ♪ Friends, it's time to take a break ♪ ♪ I spy the shadow of a cork ♪ ♪ She likes to laugh She likes to drink ♪ I've made rice with onions.

The victualler has made rice with onions, which is a very refined dish. I mean, for the soldiers, because when they were in the 1815 campaign at Waterloo, the soldiers ate flour mixed with hot water. Friendship is the most important thing in reenactment, isn't it? -[laughs] Yes. -We're all friends. When the superior officers arrived in a village, the general took the finest house, the colonel the next finest, and so on. [Bazatte] He must have plundered three million... No! A minimum of three million... No, you're wrong! You do make me cross. The Emperor confiscated three million from me! I'm after three million! [overlapping chatter] -OK. -He confiscated it. Why did he confiscate it? Where did it come from? That's none of your business! -OK! Easy to say! -It's none of your business! A drummer can't talk to a marshal, because the marshal immediately pulls rank. -That's as it should be. -Meanwhile, we're not paid. We can't pay for gold braid. Bon appétit, Marshal! In the meantime, sleep well on your purse. -Which I don't have! -Scrooge. [laughter] [music drowns speech] [in English] Because we're a little bit fed up getting beaten every year, although we should win. And this year it's totally possible that there will be a great change. [in French] Hey, guys. This time we win, huh? [in English] English! [grunts] [indistinct chatter] [in French] It's 200 euros for the car pound. So this is the car? Where is it? -Braine-l'Alleud, sire. -But you're not going to pay? -No, it's out of the question. -The car won't come back. Is there any news of...? -Is this absinthe? -[man 12] Yes, it's the one that was... Can you get me the one in the case over there, lying down? We'll see what it does to Blücher. This one is 72-degrees proof. I want to see what it does to him. -[man 13] He's capable of killing you. -For sure. -This is the soldier. -Good day, soldier. Good day. [overlapping chatter] [in English] Duncan Miles, yes. [in French] Ask Duncan Miles to give him some money for new shoes, because they look worn out. OK. [in English] You have to ask Duncan Miles to provide you money to buy new shoes. -Yes. -OK, OK. [laughs] -[in French] You will buy some shoes. -Oh, you're very kind. [in English] And one small thing, as he knows in England, there was a lot of cover in the press about remarks that the real winner of Waterloo was Napoleon. Does he still think that, or what did he mean exactly? [in French] We can still see the passion for Napoleon 200 years on. At any rate, he is the victor when it comes to fame, and victory in History with a capital H. We stand before this monument where thousands of French soldiers, and allied, died... on this battlefield. This monument represents the end of a dream, the dream of liberty. We must never forget the effort made by the Bonapartes. And all these soldiers who died for them did so with their hearts, and not just because they were ordered. You can't make hundreds of thousands of men march to their death without having courage and faith in their leader. So, gentlemen, I would simply ask you to observe one minute of silence... in memory of our Emperor and his soldiers. [plays drum] Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! To victory! [man 14 in English] An Englishman next to an American, next to a German, next to a Russian. We're all in the same unit. Any other walk of life that would be very, very hard to actually come across. [in French] Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empress! [indistinct chatter, laughter] [Samson in French] I've never seen such a strong alcoholic drink. You have to admit that it's a man's drink. I spoke to Laurence on the phone, and I told her that you won't pay and you won't do interviews. She said, "If he acts like that, I'll take his tent down." What's with this arm wrestling? But... Yes, it's blackmail. They can't pay 200 euros? I don't think you'll get anything. What are you going to do? I'll eat and then go and get my car. You can do whatever you like. -He won't pay. The organization has to. -As you wish. The problem is that my friend Christophe is on foot, so he can't get home tonight. And tomorrow morning we won't be here on time. It means that tomorrow morning I'll have to go to the pound, etc., etc. I can't do anything else. [indistinct chatter] So we cancel the transport. Sorry, can you repeat that? Yes, after 6pm. Make way for the Emperor! Make way for the Emperor! The Emperor! Hello, gentlemen! Gentlemen, I'm going straight back to the bivouac. I'm late. No, we'll go around. Thank you. See you later! [indistinct chatter] -At ease? -At ease. At ease. [shouting, horses neighing] [director in English] Where is Maréchal Né? Maréchal Né, uh, has been injured. -Wait, wait. Say again. -He has been injured this afternoon. -Oh, really? -He had an accident with the horse. And he is at the hospital. [in French] We've decided that we won't lose the battle in the way we usually have, which is by falling down. We've decided to form a real square, and this square will have to be broken to make us fall. At the time of the defeat, there were only two squares remaining on the battlefield. And these two squares... These two squares... allowed the whole of the army to retreat. And they died. Maybe we'll do the same. We're passionate, aren't we? [soldier 3] The campfire. -Meeting up with friends. -[Lerouge] What do you like? -The atmosphere. -The atmosphere? -Is it nice? -Yeah. -Hey, we have our relief troops. -Good, isn't it? There are young people who still believe in it. [singing in the background] What role would you play in the future? -No, not drummer. He'll play a grenadier. -Not drummer. I'm the drummer.

[director in English] Why is your president not here? My only answer is I don't know. 200 years ago, nobody has a bad memory of Waterloo, right? So why make it a political issue, when it should just be a fact of respecting the dead on all sides? And something that in a way created Europe as it is today? I don't understand, and I think it's a shame. But it's, again, people taking short cuts, and not learning about history, which was what we were saying about the kids. Teach them young and then they'll know the real thing, and not just what they've been stupidly told. It's, it's... I find it weird. People are believing the propaganda of 200 years ago. And in the modern, sophisticated world, a crudely delivered set-up propaganda is still believed out of convenience, and the French nation is embarrassed. They had the only democratically elected leader in Europe, and the battle of Waterloo removes that. -Um... -[man 17] Bravo! Why should France be embarrassed? You know, they should come here, and go to the-- Look at the other people, the other nations in the face, and say, "Shame on you," um, because all it did is delay everything. It didn't change anything. Um, you know, European Parliament, European currency, European laws, we already had it. And Waterloo takes it away. We must change history. Let's go and change history. [chuckles] [indistinct chatter] [soldier 4 in French] Shoulder arms! Inspection on the right! Column! Forward march! [drum and piccolo playing] [in English] Program. And this broke. And my... my ear, also. -[director] I'm sorry to hear that. -It's the battle. -Was it the battle? -It's the battle. It's normally... -[in French] I have to go. -[in English] All right. [soldier 5 in French] Come on, girls! [cannon fire] One, two. [band playing] [soldiers] France! France! France! [Samson] I'm lost... Friday. That's it. -So... -[man 18] Where's your car? In the VIP car park. Yes, but we are in Nivelles tonight. We take out the bare minimum. I just need a few things to get dressed. Tomorrow we'll load everything up. -We should go tomorrow morning. -Otherwise it's dead. When we arrive. That's not Napoleon's signature. Column! Face front! Turn right! March! [gunfire] You burned your face! Close ranks! In line! [shouting] Turn right! March! Form the square! [band playing] Never do that again! The bayonet here on his horse!

[cannon fire] [soldiers in French] ♪ Against us ♪ ♪ Tyranny's bloody banner is raised ♪ ♪ The bloody banner is raised ♪ [Wellington] We have done the business, and we have seen the short little fat man... [cheering] ...on his way to Paris! [cheering] [band playing] [in French] At ease. [indistinct chatter] It was a long way. Four kilometers there, and four kilometers back on foot. The English are about one kilometer from the site. They're already in bed, when we've only just got back. -I congratulate you, men. -Thank you, Marshal. Are you going to do it again tomorrow? [soldier 6] I got the impression we were outnumbered a hundred to one. You were outnumbered a hundred to one. It wasn't an impression, it was a fact. -I knew that the day before. -It was chaos. Why? Wait a minute, sapper. Explain what you mean by that. [mutters] Wait while I put my helmet away. Apparently, it didn't go well. Our higher ranks have still a lot of work to do. Uh... I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. [soldier 7] We didn't win anything. I worked it out. We didn't win. We didn't win? No, we didn't win. [laughter] -They nearly pinched our flag. -We sucked big time! We only had two lines of sappers, and they came at us with four ranks. -We were overwhelmed. -They came at us like cannonballs. Are you wounded? Yeah, I had a bit of a run-in with a Scotsman. -Did you hit him? -No, it was friendly, but... -I head-butted a Prussian. -Really? I don't know what he's going to look like. -That's not good. -It's not good, but... I'm going to disinfect this later. On our right, we had some Prussians. -Something else, some Scots. -Why didn't we take them on the flank? We take them on the flank, we surround them, end of story. They made us maneuver close to the line. We had no room to move. The others should have moved. Some people told us to go to La Haye Sainte. We left and went back. We saw the guys when they were going home. Because the orders were contradictory. -Just like back then. -Like back then. [laughter] Who's in charge? We don't know. There's someone shouting over there, and another over there. [laughs] At least we covered the Emperor's retreat. He can go quietly to Saint Helena. Right. [chuckles] [Samson] You have to do things seriously, but without taking yourself seriously, because that's the dark side of the force. If you get big-headed because you're a general or emperor, that's wrong. You must never forget that it's a game. And if you take yourself seriously, it's not fun anymore. It's like when you're a child. You take two cars and you play like that, and it's magical. You're absorbed in your game. But when you grow up, you lose that ability. You take two cars and it's crap. But when you play games on a huge scale like that, you get back that magical feeling of a child playing, believing in his game and being absorbed in it. [announcer in English] Our next guest, Napoleon Bonaparte, rose to prominence through the French Revolution... [Schneider] Napoleon spent some time in jail as well, and he didn't know what his future would be. [indistinct chatter] So I looked at those passages of his life for some inspiration, knowing that he encountered so many obstacles, yet he was able to continue to strive forward and overcome them. -There you go. -Thank you very much. [man 19] The English never had any intention of keeping the.... -It was only temporary. -No, they ever evacuated Malta! But you are right, the battle started too late in the day, 11:30, and the Prussians had enough time to march to Plancenoit, and that is really the cause of the loss at Waterloo. Had I had at the head of my cavalry, I would have won the battle. You say that ... Exactly! Le Case will write it down for me. [laughs] Hello, madam. I had a really wonderful time. This house has so much character to it. In fact, the reasoning behind the Napoleon House was that the Governor for Louisiana had set this house aside for Napoleon, were he to have escaped from his second island of exile. Unfortunately, Napoleon died on May 5th of 1821, so he never came to the Napoleon House. But, for me, every time I return to this wonderful place, I'm reminded of that story and of my experiences as Napoleon, which have been so very wonderful. I might not have been at Waterloo, but I suppose I have my refuge here at the Napoleon House. Mesdames et messieurs, my name is Napoleon Bonaparte. I am the Emperor of the French. After the great battle of Waterloo, it was thought by many of the European nations that I was not well fit to be the Emperor of the French any longer. But, yet, the people of New Orleans thought otherwise. So, this house has been placed at my disposal for my refuge, while I place my future plans in order. So as you so eloquently say here in Louisiana, "Laissez les bons temps rouler!" [crowd] Laissez les bons temps rouler! [cheering] [in French] Long live France! And long live the United States of America, sir! Bravo! Enjoy the evening, my friends! ♪ Arise, children of the fatherland ♪ ♪ The day of glory has arrived... ♪ [jazz music playing] [Schneider in English] I'm just fine! The Emperor of the French! You're an Emperor in your own right, are you not, sir? Beautifully engaged! [cheering] Jefferson. Jefferson... [indistinct chatter] [laughter] [music drowns speech] Emperor, this is one reason why I know the two of us are alive on that subject of education, and particularly with respect to history. -That people never forget their history. -Guys... Can you take it? Thank you. [cheering] I was going to say that we are aligned in our interest in history, and in support of Cicero who wrote, "A people must never forget their history. If they forget their history, they will be like schoolchildren all their lives, ready to be led, rather than to lead themselves." Well spoken, monsieur.
