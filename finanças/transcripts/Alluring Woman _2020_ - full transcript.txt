[English subtitles are available.] An abnormal sign. Spirit. The offering we received this year is lesser than last year. Exactly. Everyone in court knows that money makes things easier. Except for Su Hu. He is leading the Earl of the West and his people to publicly oppose us. If this continues, things will get worse for us every year. Enough. Isn't the daughter of Su Hu entering the palace soon? How mean. He is not paying you bribes and you people are making his daughter enter the palace to serve the King. If the King happens to favour Daji and she turns against you two, then we'll see what can you do. The King holds the Selection annually. He has countless concubines. How would he favour Daji exclusively? Gunjuan is right. You can't just barge in wherever you like. There are no spirits here. The lords are resting. You are a mere mortal. If you ever saw a spirit, you would have been scared to death. Jiang Ziya, why are you catching spirits in the middle of the night? Lord You. Lord Fei. You are still a lower magnate in charge of etiquette. It's the middle of the night. Why on earth are you catching spirits? Lord Fei, there's something you don't know. There is a spirit... in this premise. Am I a spirit? Yes. I am a spirit? I am a spirit. I'm saying that she is a spirit. She is a spirit indeed. She's not only a spirit, she is also seductive. Get out of my sight! Zi Ya, I have some business to settle with Lord You. Leave us. I am sorry for disturbing you. I shall take my leave. It's still not leaving. You old geezer. You have been chasing me for the entire night. I was just meditating on my own. I didn't cause anybody any harm. To kill demons and eliminate evil spirits. To enforce justice on behalf of Heaven. You don't even have a lotus flower on your head and you wish to eliminate me? Do you think you are Daluo Golden Immortal? Celestial soldiers, descend and get into formation. Go. Demon exorcism hand seal. Please let me go. I have been meditating for a thousand years. It has not been easy. Spit out your spiritual pill and I will offer you a chance to be a fox. Thunder exorcism. A horrendous illusion. Open. Heaven and Earth separated. Yin and yang distinguished. Quickly! Thousand years of your meditation should have helped you achieve transcendence. But instead of that, you chose to go to the mortal world and cause trouble. Do not blame me for eliminating you. I, Jiang Ziya bows to the King. I went hunting for animals while you went hunting for spirits. Both of us did not attend the court today. The evil spirits are bringing harm to the mortal world. I have to do something. Earl of the West, Jichang. Yes, Your Majesty. This fox knows that it's going to die. Its eyes are tearing up like a human does. Let me ask you, who is the evil one? The spirit or the human? Your Majesty, there are good and evil human beings. This spirit is not entirely evil. You know the way of Liu Yao Divination, try it on this fox spirit. If it shows good omen, let it go. If it is bad, kill it. Your Majesty, the omen is ambiguous. It is neither right or wrong. Only cause and consequence. Should we let it go? Or should we not? The cause and consequence are decided by Heaven. I... I do not know. Go. You don't but I do. Let it go. I want to see what will this cause lead to. You'd better watch yourself. [Alluring Woman] I am under the order of the King to escort the daughter of Su Hu from Jizhou, Daji to enter the palace. We are passing by this province. We have been waiting for your arrival. It's too windy out here. Do have some rest in our stay. Beauties bring misfortune. It's so cold. It's such a big storm. Of course, it would be cold. No. The wind is so cold that it penetrates my bones. I'm shivering from inside. What is this? If you don't wish to have this face of yours, let me have it then. Human. We've reached Zhaoge. Here. Over here. Your Majesty, this beauty here is Daji. The daughter of Su Hu from Jizhou. She has a beautiful face. Didn't Su Hu mention that his manor has no beauty? He cares about his daughter more as he gets older. He didn't want her to marry far away, so it's understandable. He is being so petty. It is her honour to be able to serve the King. The sister of King Wucheng, Huang Yingxuan is entering to meet the King. Yingxuan is here. I have told your brother numerous times. I have been intending to have you enter the palace to deepen our allegiance. But your brother always refused, saying that you are still young. But now, you have turned out to be such a beauty. Thank you, Your Majesty. I persuaded King Wucheng to have her participate in the Selection this time. Or else, he would have refused as usual. Just like Su Hu. They are protective of their family. King Wucheng comes from a lineage of loyal officials. Do not simply pass your judgements. From now on, Shouxian Palace belongs to you. I will grant you the title as... The Lady of the West Palace. Thank you, Your Majesty. Your Majesty, well... What about Daji? For the time being, this beauty will stay at Wenyi Court. You may all leave now. What's wrong? Did you marry me just because of my brother? If that is the case, what will you do? From today onwards, you will always be in my heart. My only wish is that I am also the only one in your heart. You will be in my heart. And I will be in yours. I saw you in Xi Garden. It seems you are well acquainted with Lord Fei and Lord You. I lived poorly when I was a human being. I meditated for so many years, it would be such a waste if I do not enjoy my time in the mortal world. Both of the lords are being followed around by a spirit. Just the thought of is terrifying. You are the one who should be afraid. Look at the couple in Shouxian Palace, they are having the time of their life together. Look at you. Alone in your room. Talking to a spirit. Tell me. Why are you here? I am here to help. You are just a nobody. How can you help me? I can help you to kill, to win favours and wreak havoc in the palace. I'm surprised. You are quite ambitious. Who doesn't want to be an immortal? Nowadays, even the spirits want to be an immortal. Aren't you here for that? The Shang Dynasty is coming to an end. Who is willing to enforce justice on behalf of Heaven and bring down the leadership of King Zhou? He saved me once. I didn't want him to die at the hand of the others. I absolutely don't need the help of a spirit. Being a spirit is much better than being a human. You have to do more. The King only favours Consort Huang. If you are unable to gain his love, and fail to carry out the order of Goddess Nuwa, what will happen to you? Nonsense. You are still young. Can you even win against the calculating people in the palace? Besides, the powerful Jiang Ziya is in this palace. Bo Yikao is entering to meet the King. Your Majesty, I came from Xiqi to bring you a gift. The name of the gift is called 'A Treasure' I supposed it actually means 'Save My Father'. My father, Jichang was provoked. He made a thoughtless mistake to foresee the King's fate. I beg of you to forgive his wrongdoing. Who provoked him? Explain it yourself. The truth is that he is arrogant and speaks without thinking. Bo Yikao is pleading on behalf of his father. He is asking for forgiveness from the King. Why is Lord You getting impatient instead? Could it be that you are a part of this, too? You... King Wucheng, Lord Fei always speaks his mind. He is afraid that Bo Yikao might mislead the King. Your Majesty is wise and shrewd. He will not be misled. How dare you speak out of turn? Quiet, all of you. Bo Yikao. I heard that you are good at playing the Chinese zither. I just play it quite often and picked up some skills. King Wucheng, I heard that your sister likes to play the instrument. I wish to have Bo Yikao provide her with some guidance. What do you think? Consort Huang is responsible for serving the King. She should learn more skills. Ziya, what is it? I see a dark shadow between the King's eyebrows. A dark shadow? The palace is being guarded heavily. Could it be that you have mistaken? Let's get going. It's that song as always. But... it lingers now. It's still the same song. It's just that the listener is not the same anymore. It's still the same listener. It's just that the listener feels differently to the song now. The zither is played by hands and it plays what is in the heart. It is my honour that Your Highness understands it. It feels like the memories of my childhood had just happened yesterday. The time of innocence and simplicity is gone forever. You shouldn't have come to Zhaoge. My father is suffering in prison. As the eldest son, how could I remain indifferent in Xiqi? His Majesty has arrived. Your Majesty. Who are you? I am Su Daji. So, you were the one behind the curtains. Yes. Raise your head. Your Majesty. Bo Yikao bowing to His Majesty. I received something today. I came here especially to give it to you. So that when winter comes, my beloved consort will not feel cold. Thank you, Your Majesty. What do you want? We humbly offer our loyalty to Your Highness. We will act upon your order. I don't understand. Both of you have not been on good terms with my father. I ended up in the palace thanks to the trickery that you two pulled off. Why did both of you suddenly change your minds? I told them. There are indeed countless beauties in the inner court, but none of their beauty is comparable to you. You are beautiful and talented. Gentle and kind. You will be loved by the people. -Loved by the people. -Loved by the people. Stop it. I am not virtuous and talented at all as compared to Consort Huang. Your Highness, do you really had no idea? Consort Huang is the sister of King Wucheng. Huang Feihu has control of the army and has a deep influence in court. The King is aware of him. Therefore, he is treating Consort Huang differently. I supposed their relationship is not entirely pure. You all are afraid of King Wucheng, aren't you? See? I told you that Her Highness will understand. From now on, if there is anything, just tell her right away. Anyhow, everything we do is for your sake. Fine. Say it then. Fei Zhong and You Hun are coaxing the King to frame the Earl of the West. If it wasn't for the two of them, how would he try to foresee the King's fate? The life of the Earl of the West is in King Wucheng's hands. We'll talk after entering the palace. I'm afraid it's not that simple. My Lord, please be careful. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. Your Majesty, Jichang said that you are going to end up badly in life. This is blasphemy. You have shown him great mercy by just putting him in prison. Bo Yikao came presenting a gift. It is obviously an attempt to save his father. If our friendship back then ever meant something, please help save my father. The Earl of the West has been guarding Xiqi for many years. Their people are honest and kind. How admirable. Jichang is a wise ruler. I will find a way even if you don't ask. I will tell His Majesty. Bo Yikao wish to thank Your Highness on behalf of my father. Get up already. You are making us seem distant. You are the King's consort, I am his subject. It's only right for us to keep a distance. I heard Bo Yikao has been teaching Consort Huang to play the zither. Let bygones be bygones. I hope you find someone who truly understands you. Fate will find its way. I heard both of them have known each other since they were little. Fate will find its way. Fate has separated us. For us to distance ourselves from each other. For us to distance ourselves from each other? What if we can't? If you still have feelings for me, hug me. What are you talking about? I heard that Bo Yikao has been recruiting capable men. He is diligent and kind to his people and strengthens the defence of the city. Doesn't this... mean something? His wicked intention is crystal clear. I have imprisoned the Earl of the West for seven years. Your Majesty, Your... Your Majesty, Consort Huang... Your heart is racing. I am in no place to disrespect Your Highness. How is this offending me? This is... both of us being in love. Don't you want to? I am always respectful to Your Highness. It's always been like this. If there is next life, if we have the chance to meet again, I hope our wish will be fulfilled. But you... are the Lady of the West Palace now. I... I can only be the subject of the King. Bo Yikao, what are you doing? Bo Yikao, it's outrageous for you and your father to go this far to disregard the King. Killing you a thousand times is not enough to atone for your sin. Bo Yikao has never done anything wrong or sinful in the past. I cannot believe that he tried to disrespect Consort Huang. I saw it myself. It's not up to you to decide if you want to believe it or not. King Wucheng, Consort Huang is your sister by blood. How could you defend Bo Yikao? Bo Yikao came to atone for his father's sin. If it is as you said, I think there must be something we don't know. Bo Yikao! Tell us the truth. I... have nothing to say. Something is not right. Bo Yikao seems to have been poisoned by a spirit. Poisoned by a spirit? Are you sure? Behold the descend of the Five Planets. Lights upon the cold and quiet. The world is just and fair. Nothing can be hidden completely. You don't remember anything? I just remember feeling light-headed and dazed. When I opened my eyes, Your Majesty had arrived. How have I been treating you? Your Majesty has been very caring to me. So, why aren't you being honest with me? Every word I said is true. Bo Yikao has admitted to his crime. I don't know why... Quiet! What will you do to him? After three days, he will be beheaded along with Jichang! Ziya, we have been working together in the court for so long. I've always wanted to be closer to you. I got something today. I would like you to take a look at it. If you took a liking to it, just take it all. I have been practising cultivation for more than 40 years. I have long abandoned materialism. Lord Fei and Lord You, just be upfront and tell me what is this about. The father and son from Xiqi have nothing to do with you. Why did you defend them in the court? Lord You is proposing that we might be able to work together. The world knows that where there is beauty, there must be ugliness. Goodbye. You... Since Bo Yikao and Consort Huang have feelings for each other, why didn't they make use of that opportunity? Perhaps they are truly in love with each other? So, why didn't they just be together? You can't force happiness. Besides, loving someone doesn't mean you have to be together. Humans are more complicated than you think. If there are so many concerns in this world, why don't they find someone they love and live quietly in the mountains? Live an ordinary life. He is here. Your Majesty, what are you trying to do? Accompany me to sleep. Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Why does it feel so cold? I don't feel anything blissful like they said. It's because it's not love. It's all anger. Anger? Anger towards Consort Huang. He vented it all on you. Bo Yikao would never disrespect Her Highness. I know who you are. But why would such a thing happen? You have to take care of your health. Everyone is alienating me. You are the only one that came to visit me. It's because they don't know who you are. You do? You are virtuous and talented. You are definitely not a disloyal person. What did you say? I said something wrong. You are here to mock me. Both of you are good friends since childhood. You two finally got to see each other. For sure, your feelings would overflow. What are you trying to do? I'm trying to have a heart-to-heart conversation. What are you trying to achieve? Bo Yikao, did anything strange happen when you were alone with Consort Huang? Back then, I was begging Her Highness to save my father. But in the midst of our conversation, she changed. She became someone I don't know. After that, a wave of dizziness engulfed me and I can't recall what happened next. Bo Yikao, come forward to me. Since both of you like each other, you have to be with him. Say no more. Do not accuse me of something I didn't do. So, are you really willing to be separated from him, to restrain from each other? How dare you listen to our conversation? You are such a hateful woman. Why did you hit her? I... I just wanted to comfort her. But I wasn't careful with my words and it made her upset. What did you say? I... I said that Bo Yikao is despicable and he deserves severe punishment. I hoped that Her Highness doesn't get too upset. That's not what she said at all. And what did she say? One thing after another. You hit Daji without any reason. You and your brother are outrageous. Some of the spirit's poison still remains in Bo Yikao's eyes. Consort Huang must have been affected by the spirit as well. There is really an evil spirit in the palace? My Lord. My Lady. Your sister was found hitting Daji. The King has sent her to the cold palace. -What? -Daji? Yes. The daughter of Su Hu from Jizhou. That's not right. Daji is dead. She's dead? Are you all right? Thank you, Your Majesty. What for? For saving me. If so, repay me. What are you listening to? Where are you going, old man? The inner court is filled with impurity. We have a spirit and a ghost. Well, am I the spirit? Or the ghost? How hideous. I see you became a spirit from a pile of bones. There are human bones filled with hatred everywhere on the mass graves. I simply borrowed them. I can't believe you succeeded in acquiring an actual spirit. So, it was you. I warned you to watch yourself when I gave you a second chance. I just did what I had to do. You are still trying to justify yourself when all you did was to cause trouble. Jiang Ziya, I suggest you to stop meddling in this. I can't sit by and do nothing when there's a spirit loitering around. Assassin! Take one more step ahead and I will wake the King up. I will accuse you of trying to assassinate His Majesty. You seduced the King, associate with immoral officials and framed the good and faithful. You cannot be forgiven. I'd rather accomplish my given duties than obey the rules, I'm not just doing this for myself. Hurry up and leave. Once the Imperial Army has arrived, you won't be able to get yourself out of this. The circle of life never stops. It will always return. You will receive punishment from Heaven for what you have done. Where is the King? His Majesty is asleep. She's back to life! She is standing up! What is going on? This... This... There are so many of you. That fox spirit has transformed into Daji. Doesn't that mean the King had been sleeping next to a spirit all along? Doesn't that mean my sister is in grave danger? We shall tell the truth to the King when we attend the court tomorrow. We have to expose Daji's intention and tell the truth for the sake of my sister. We have to save Bo Yikao and his father. That fox spirit is sly, deceitful and has many tricks up her sleeves. She held the King who was unconscious as a hostage and shouted that there was an assassination. As long as she is with the King, it is difficult for me to do anything. Right now, we do not have any evidence. Even if we told the truth, nobody would believe us. The spirits are causing trouble in the palace. This is a crisis for the Shang Dynasty. An assassin invaded the inner court yesterday. Are you fine, Your Majesty? Did anything happen to you, Your Majesty? It's all because of Daji that I can still attend the court. I must reward those who did well. I'm going to make Daji the Lady of the West Palace. Your Majesty, Though Consort Huang is reflecting on her behaviour in the cold palace, her title still held effective. She is still the Lady of the West Palace. If Your Majesty insists on appointing another concubine, I'm afraid this goes against the moral standards. If Your Majesty insists on abolishing Consort Huang's title... I beg of the King to abolish my title as King Wucheng as well. -Please reconsider, Your Majesty. -Please reconsider, Your Majesty. Your Majesty. King Wucheng is from a lineage of loyal officials. He is the pillar of our nation. I believe the incident a few days ago and the assassination that took place yesterday night, was caused by the evil spirit. We need to investigate this matter and gather evidence at once. I will investigate the assassination right away. Your Majesty, please allow Consort Huang to return to the West Palace. -Please allow Consort Huang to return. -Please allow Consort Huang to return. All of you... are all of you threatening the King? It's treason. It's treason. Your Majesty. King Wucheng and Jiang Ziya are disregarding the King. If the King continues to comply, it would be over for us. Your Highness, our lives are in your hands. That's right. Your Highness, Consort Huang is coming back to the West Palace. What's mine will be mine in the end. Daji wasn't able to take over the West Palace today. She will definitely take it out on my sister. You have to bring this mirror to the palace and give it to Her Highness. This way, the spirit wouldn't be able to come close to her. If it wasn't for Ziya, Daji was just one step away from becoming the Lady of the West Palace. We have to get rid of her as soon as possible. You cannot enter the inner court anymore. If that's the case, I will have to lure her out. Consort Huang is returning to the West Palace. I had no choice. You must be upset. I am not. You cared about me. I promise I will see to it that you take over the main court one day. There's no need for that. As long as I could stay by your side. Are you all right? Your Highness. How about you? The King did not blame me for what happened. I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to hear that. Right. King Wucheng told me. Daji was the one who set us up. I know. You have to be careful in the palace. Don't worry about me. I'm here to save you. I used Divination to track down this place. This is where Daji used to meditate. Her kind is all staying in this cave. What a terrible smell. It reeks. What is this smell? Where are the guards? King Wucheng switched them out. Formation. Leave this place immediately. King Wucheng is rescuing your father. Head east for 20 miles. There will be a pavilion. You will meet your father there at dawn. Take care. [Scrolls inscribed about the immortals. Bring peace to the world.] To hide one's presence and identity. Trusted by the gods and the ghosts. There are about a hundred of fox spirits in this cave. Your Highness, are you asleep? Yes. Wait until tomorrow if there's anything. The King is coming to see me. Stop causing me any more trouble. The mirror in your hands looks like something that can ward off the spirits. Are you a spirit? Yes. Bo Yikao has a pretty face and also a knowledgeable person. How nice. If you are jealous of me, why do you have to drag him into this? I don't get it. How can you fall in love with two people at the same time? As for me, the King is the only one in my heart. You have a heart? You don't know anything about a human's heart. Bo Yikao and I are bosom friends. Our relationship is pure. We are separated and restrained from each other. He lost someone who understands his music and I lost someone who understands me. Bo Yikao is someone who understands me the best. The King is my husband. And I carry myself with virtue and morality. If you have such a great heart, shall I... have a taste of your heart? You are still an animal that had crept out of your cave even if you have eaten a thousand hearts. You can never be human. What is so good about being human? You get old and die. All you have is a useless body. Humans are above all animals. How would a spirit understand? Spirits are what the human heart reflects. If you are jealous of me, just kill me. Stop harming others. I don't have to kill you myself. Someone will do it for me. How dare you... help Bo Yikao to escape? Lock her up. That woman. If it wasn't for King Wucheng, I would have killed her. Has Bo Yikao been caught? He has been put back into his cell. I will kill that father and son tomorrow. I heard that the Earl of the West had foreseen your fate. That cunning man said that I will end up badly in life. That I will set myself on fire and die. Such a treacherous act. It's a mercy to just let him die. What should I do then? We can try if Jichang can actually foresee his son's fate. It must be very uncomfortable to be here. You killed Bo Yikao. You killed him. I did not. It was the cook who minced his flesh and made it into meat cakes. If Jichang can't foresee that, he had probably eaten his son's flesh. You will be staying here forever. I will not let the King kill you. I want you to witness how I steal everyone's heart away. You can't go! It would only mean death to you. Have you forgotten why you are here? So, do I have to let them die in vain? Will you even be able to fight Jiang Ziya? It's past noon. Will she not be here? She's still in the palace. My Lord, a strong wind swept across the mansion. When the wind came to a stop, the Lady... She disappeared! What? My Lord, news from the palace. Consort Huang is locked up in a cell for helping Bo Yikao to escape. What about Bo Yikao? The King has minced his flesh into pieces and made it into meat cakes for the Earl of the West to consume. Your Majesty, they said Lady Jia is good at drawing eyebrows. So, I invited her to help me with my eyebrows. Look. Do they look pretty? Your Majesty. Lady Jia? Here. Let the King have a look. Don't her eyebrows look better than mine? [Zhou...] [Such a debauched and unworthy ruler.] Six hundred years of the Shang Dynasty is on the brim of collapsing. The ruler has violated the Mandate of Heaven and favours Daji. King Zhou... We can't support him anymore. I have always known the King to be gallant. Who knew that he can be so romantic? Why? Are you envious? Yes, I do. She wishes to serve you as well, Your Majesty. We will bring him down then. We have to rescue Lady Jia and Consort Huang [when the Imperial Army is exchanging shifts.] I have the commander's tally. Every Imperial Army, on my command. Do not move without my order. [And we will rescue the Earl of the West overnight.] [After that,] [we will meet at the first pavilion.] My Lady. King Wucheng. You barged into the palace with your army and weapons in hands. What are you trying to do? You disrespected my wife and killed your faithful men. You are unworthy to be the King! How dare you go against your King? Guards! Guards! Guards! What happened? Why am I here? Don't you remember? We were having fun with the King. With the King? Lady Jia, don't believe in her words. They were the one who kidnapped you and brought you to this place. Jiang Ziya, all of you saw how she had fun with the King. No one was forcing her. She was the one who wanted to be loyal to her King. Nonsense! Don't you dare insult her. Your true form is a nine-tailed fox. You hide in the inner court and seduced the King. Now, you're trying to frame Lady Jia again. The King is wise. Do you think he cannot differentiate between a human and a spirit? All of you keep insisting that I'm a spirit. Who can prove that to be the truth? Jiang, please turn her back to her true form and prove my innocence. You mingled with humans. I should have just killed her back then to return peace to the world. I won't let that happen! How dare all of you treacherous officials try to assassinate the consort? I'm going to torture and kill... every last one of you today! Sister, things have gone too far. What will you do if the King is hurt? Shut up! You seduced the King and humiliated me. I am going to kill you even if it will be the death of me! My Lady! My Lady! How dare you assassinate the consort? Are you all trying to overthrow me? You're an immoral King! You do truly love me. You killed all my kind. And you tried to kill me so many times. Today let's settle things between us. Bring me back my wife! Come on out. They are prepared for this all along. This demon completed its form with thousands of bones. I wonder if you can defeat it. It's child's play. You're evil. You can use that whip on the gods. But I guess it is inadequate to exorcise demons? Ziya! Fox spirit. Time of the world, the demons will take its form. Time of the world, the demons will be sent to hell. Old man. You are looking for death. Return to hell. Time of the world, the demons will be stopped. Time of the world, the demons will die. Quickly! Save me! I will never reincarnate if I were to enter hell. Your Highness. Your Highness. Your Highness. King Wucheng attempts to murder the King. -Get them. -Get them. Unable to differentiate between good and evil. How imbecile. I couldn't bear to hurt you. Daji, we will meet again. The Imperial Army arrived just when they got me out of prison. We had no choice but to break out from the army. But Consort Huang... Her Highness... What? The Earl of the West received help and escaped from prison? Chase him! Get him back! They are forming an alliance to overthrow the King. I've told you before. -But Your Majesty... -Your Majesty, Jiang Ziya is a powerful sorcerer. I'm afraid they have arrived Xiqi now. King Wucheng is brave and unrivalled while Jichang has been training his army for years. Now that they have Jiang Ziya to help with their military strategy, we have to prepare ourselves as soon as possible. I have a plan. What is it? We will build the Deer Tower. The Deer Tower? The platform is 500 feet tall. Three miles wide. It is exquisite and extravagant. Decorate the tower with the best treasure to gather the energy. After building it, light the incense for a hundred days and we can then invite the immortals to the mortal world. By then, it can be used to fight against Jiang Ziya, the King will also know the way to eternal life. Is that so? Your Majesty, I have heard of this before as well; that the Deer Tower is incredible. We can use it to fight off Jiang Ziya and attain eternal life. Your Majesty, it's killing two birds in one stone. All right. I will hand this task to both of you. Make use of all our resources and build the Deer Tower. Yes. I haven't seen you for a few days and you have aged so much. It's because I'm human. My heart aches. Then, I will cause you more pain so that your ageing will be accelerated even further. I don't care. If I've gotten old, will you still love me the same? If you've gotten old, I will still stay by your side. Do you really mean it? Your Majesty! -Your Majesty. -Your Majesty. Jiang Ziya has become a minister in Xiqi. What? [Jiang Ziya built] [the Fengshen Tower on] [Fengming Mountain.] [They said it is to vanquish the gods] [and overthrow... overthrow the King.] The phoenix is crying in the mountains of Qi. The true King has appeared. Accelerate the process of building the Deer Tower. Nothing can stop us when we have summoned the immortals. Zhou is building the Deer Tower. Sixty thousand people have been sacrificed because of that. All of Zhaoge is suffering. King Wucheng has been training his army for years, I believe we can set out in no time. We will depend on you to overthrow Zhou. The Deer Tower is completed. -Congratulations, Your Majesty. -Congratulations, Your Majesty. -Congratulations, Your Highness. -Congratulations, Your Highness. When the immortals have descended to assist us, Jiang Ziya is nothing to be worried about. Your Majesty is going to acquire eternal life. Now that the Deer Tower is completed, we can spend the rest of our lives together. Your Majesty, there... there is something else. Jiang Ziya has advanced to Wuguan. What? Both of you head to the Deer Tower and invite the immortals. You have gotten so old these few years. I can't be compared to a spirit. What do you think about this place? Are you showing off? I'm just telling you that Jiang Ziya and King Wucheng will die here. This is my revenge on them. You sacrificed 60,000 of our people by building this platform. All of this just for your revenge? That's right. I can gather energy from Heaven and Earth from this tower. I can do anything I want. Tell me, why didn't you kill me? I won't kill you. I want to show you how your beloved King loves me, how your people suffer, and how the corpses of your family rot away. Wild dogs will devour their flesh. To be evil is a choice for you. To be kind is my nature. You are malicious. Heaven will punish you for it. The Shang Dynasty is the one being punished. This nation is doomed to fall. It is not caused by me. If you refused to kill me, I would really like to see how all of you will end up. Sure. If we manage to summon the immortals to help us, my nation can be secured. I can finally be with you for the rest of our lives. The time is here. Welcome the immortals. As... as all of you are here, please reveal yourselves. Greetings to all of you. Your Majesty is too courteous. Please rise. I have built the Deer Tower for several years. I have used countless number of wood and stones. I placed the treasure of the nation here to gather spiritual energy. I have done all these to prepare for your arrival. I have prepared delicacies for all of you to enjoy. Please drink up. Our Intel in the palace reported that the people and the soldiers are waiting for us in Zhaoge. So, we don't have to attack the palace. We will just surround the place. It would be great if we could avoid affecting the people. Have they really arrived with the army? Yes, My Lord. My Lord, Jiang Ziya has had his army surround the palace. Does anyone know that there is a type of sorcery that can swallow the sky? It is a type of incredible sorcery. What can it do? After the sorcery, your spiritual pill will return to your body and you will acquire an eternal golden form. We can then cultivate ourselves into an indestructible original spirit. How do we, the lower immortals like us get to perform this sorcery? We will need to gather all of your spiritual pills, focus on the emptiness and absorb the spiritual energy from Heaven and Earth until eternity. That's when the sorcery will be completed. So, this is your way to achieve eternal life? Just a little contact with this spiritual energy, you will not only achieve immortality but more. The aura of the evil spirit is overwhelming. It must be that fox spirit. You just have to surround the palace, I will go and meet Daji. Please avenge for my family and for our country. Jiang Ziya! You really don't give up until you are done. You succeeded in gathering so many spirits. How cunning of you. You stole their spiritual pills to be powerful. I've told you before. The world is just and fair. Nothing can be hidden completely. I did all this just to kill you. Zhou, what do you think about Daji? Is she a human? Or is she a spirit? You are a spirit. You had fooled to me for so many years. If I have told you earlier, will you still love me? Are you really here to ruin my kingdom as they said? Jiang Ziya's army have arrived at the palace right now. The Shang Dynasty is coming to an end. I'm the only one who can save you. Your Majesty, we can only trust Her Highness for now. Your Majesty, let fate decide for us. You were the reason for the death of the lords and Bo Yikao, right? They were destined to die. What about Consort Huang? You are still concerned about her. Did you also frame her? Tell me. Ask her yourself. Are you Yingxuan? You don't recognise me anymore. Did she turn you into this? It was you. This is what you have done to me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I lived until this day to witness your ending. Now, I can finally rest in peace. Yingxuan, I was wrong. I was wrong. I was wrong. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late to realise your mistakes now. You saved me once many years ago. Now, I have returned the favour. Are you... the fox in the forest? It is your fate for your kingdom to fall. I wanted to help you escape, to live remotely in a faraway land and spend our lives together. However... you never loved me. To have our names hated by the next generation? Well then... all our ties are cut now. Jiang Ziya, you and I are not finished yet. You have practised cultivation for a thousand years, and you could have achieved transcendence. But your desire to kill is too strong. Even the Fengshen Tower could not keep you away. Who cares? Demon exorcism hand seal. Heaven Thunder Crusher. Right now, you have entered my illusion. I'm afraid you will have to surrender your heart. To understand Heaven and Earth. To be enlightened. I am within it. It is within me. I have gone through cultivation for a thousand years. With so many spiritual pills inside me, I will not be defeated by you so easily. Freeze. Celestial soldiers, descend and get into formation. Go. Why do you still not understand? Spirit is what the human heart reflects. How obstinate. Go! Enter. Time of the world, the demons will take its form. Time of the world, the demons will be sent to hell. Are you trying to send me to hell? You intend to die with me by exhausting all of your strength? Do you think there is still a reason for me to stay? Do not be seduced by what you own. Do not be seduced by what you achieved. Stand firmly in the world. Yin and Yang is found in all things. Go. If I am human again, I really would like to know what is... love. Zhou, this is the consequence for the deed that you did. Everything originates from nature. To return to your truest intention.
