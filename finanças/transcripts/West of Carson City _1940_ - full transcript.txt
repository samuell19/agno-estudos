Nevada, you and the boys push these cattle on through to the Brady ranch. I got a little business with the Pony Express rider. Okay, Jim. See ya later. Let's go We're fine to let go We've done our job steadily Gotten by readily You can bet We're gonna let go You better lay low For when we let go The coyotes all around the corner Let's go We're fine to let go We've done our job steadily Gotten by readily You can bet We're gonna let go Hey, there. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm the Pony Express rider. Say, you're a new man on the job, aren't ya? Sure. Well, I'm kinda sorry to handle you so rough but that's the only way I could stop you. What is this, a hold-up? Well, not exactly. - What's on your mind? - My name is Jim Bannister. I own the Circle X Ranch over near Ridgeville, and I want you to do me a favor. Well, let's have it. I can't be wastin' much time. Well, when you get into Ridgeville, I want you to tell old man Howard to tell my foreman Banjo that I'm delayed up here a little longer than I expected. But I want him to keep things running nice and smooth at the ranch until I get back. You sure went to a lotta trouble to deliver that message. Well, it's kinda important to me. - Will you do it? - Sure. Good boy. Well, that's about all I had in mind. Say, wait a minute. According to post office regulations, you should put a stamp on that message. I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll write a letter to the president. See you again. Not if I see ya first you won't. Yessiree. This town is done for. Why, I've seen the time when this street was so packed you'd have to shoot your way into my store. But nothin' like that is going to happen again, Banjo. No, siree. Why, I remember the time when... I don't care what you do, or the horses either. Tarnation! For pretty near three years I've been goin' around talking to myself. If you didn't wanna talk, why'd you come down out of the hills for? It's about time you gettin' into town. You mean ghost town, don't you, Lem? Son, there are times I wouldn't mind even seein' a ghost, if it could talk. It gets pretty lonesome around here. Well, there is your mail, that ought to keep you busy for a while. "Rain City News!" And only two weeks old. - You know Jim Bannister? - Who? - Bannister. - Jim? Do I know him? Why, I raised him. He's over the ridge helping Brady clean out some rustlers. That boy's always doing things for somebody. Why do you ask? He wants you to tell his foreman that he won't be home for a while, and for him to keep things runnin' smooth. Well, there's his foreman. And if you can wake him up, tell him yourself. Lem! Struck it rich there! Lem! Lem! Oh, Lem! Lem! Lem, I've struck it rich! I've struck it rich! - Why, I... - Look... - Look, gold! - Gold? - Gold. - Gold. Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold! What's the trouble, boys? Snicker Joe just found gold. Far more than you ever seen before. Where? Where's the strike? Right outside of town. Will you stake a claim for me? Sure, right next to ours. Boys, I'm gonna spread this news all over the country. Let me see that gold. Oh, I knew I'd... - Gold! - I knew I'd get it someday. Lem, I knew I'd do it. You took my horse. That's right. This is gold. Gold! Gold! There's been a gold strike at Ridgeville. Gold! Gold! Gold! "The biggest gold strike in this territory." Boys, it looks like we're joinin' that stampede, and the sooner the better. They dig for the gold, and we take it away from 'em, right, Gorman? Well, let's get goin'? Boys, this land around here is full of gold. Yes, sir, full of gold. And I'm sellin' claims right next to the mother lode. Now, all you have to do is buy one of my claims, and dig up the gold. So, if you'll step in the tent here and sign on the dotted lines, I guarantee it'll make millionaires out of ya. Come on, boys, don't be bashful. Pay up, partner. Gorman's sure got a gold mine here. This place is more prosperous than the mother lode. Yeah. He can't lose. He practically runs the town. You mean that he owns the town. Heavy! - Where are ya? - Right here. Glad to see ya, boss. Mighty lonesome around here. Say, what's the idea of letting my horses run loose in the front yard? Well, I-- I can't handle the cookin' and the wrangler stock. It get me all mixed up. Where's Banjo and Nevada and the rest of the cowhands? Well, they've gone over to Ridgeville six days ago, said they weren't comin' back. Now, what are they doing in that dilapidated old ghost town? Mr. Jim, you've been up in them hills so long you don't know what's going on. Why, there's a big gold strike over there. - A gold strike? - Yes, sir. Why, that town must have all of ten thousand people in it by now. You wouldn't know the old place. Now, listen, you get my horses in the corral, I'm going in to round up those cowhands if I have to hog-tie 'em. Go on, you, fellas. Up with 'em! Alright, Sleepy, keep the other one covered. Get down from there. Toss me your rope, Sleepy. Get down from there. While I'm tying up these two birds, you take care of the saddle horses. Sure good seein' ya again, Jim. - When'd ya get back? - Oh, a couple days ago. When I get these two coyotes on the stage you can head for town. Right. I'm sorry to disturb you folks, but you'll have to make room for a couple new passengers headed your way. You all ready down there, Jim? - Let her roll. - Andy! That was mighty neat work, young man. - I want to congratulate you. - Thank you, sir. Would you mind tying this handkerchief on this man's wrist? He's bleeding pretty badly. Well, certainly not. I want to get acquainted with a young man of your caliber. My name is Judge Harkins. I'm mighty pleased to meet you, sir. - My name is Jim Bannister. - How do you do? Oh, uh, my daughter Millie. - How do you do, ma'am? - How do you do? I'm on my way to Ridgeville. I'm going to set up a little law and order. There's no doubt they need it by now. Yes, since the gold strike, they say it's a pretty bad town. You know, the lawless element, they seem to have taken it over. I see. We darn near got held up coming through the canyon. Would have been too if it hadn't been for young Jim Bannister. Yeah? Who's Jim Bannister? That's him helpin' the folks out of the stage. Well... I'll take charge of the prisoners, Bannister. Who are you? I'm the mayor of the town, and justice of the peace, Mack Gorman. Seems kinda strange to have a mayor, and a real live judge around here. By the way, might as well know each other. - This is Judge Harkins. - Glad to know you. Same here. Heard you were comin'. I got a nice comfortable place all fixed up for you. Well, thanks. Oh, allow me, my daughter Millie. - Mr. Gorman. - It's a pleasure. - Thank you. - I'll get rid of the prisoners. And then I'll take you over to your new place. Breed. Lock 'em up and get the doc to fix up their wounds. He's pretty fast on the trigger, but he's a good half-breed. Well, I wouldn't call Bannister here exactly slow on the trigger. So I hear. Well, I've got a few things to attend to, so I'll be moseying along. Mighty glad to have met you folks. Oh, don't forget you're the star witness when I try those men. Just set the time. Well, how 'bout tomorrow morning? Sooner the better. Quick justice is what we need around here. - Goodbye, Ms. Harkins. - Goodbye. I do hope we'll see you again. You know, we have a lot for which to thank you. You don't worry about seeing me again. I'm the coming-roundest guy you ever invited. You know, that's one of the most interesting young men I ever met. A fine mess you two made of that hold-up. If you'd been in our place, you couldn't have done any different. Why, this fellow Bannister-- If you mention his name again, I'll break ya in two. It was your place to keep the judge out of town. Yeah, but Bannister... Wait a minute, Mack. Losing your temper won't do any good. I saw Bannister in action, and let me tell you, he ain't to be fooled with. I'll say he ain't. I've known him for years. I will take care of him if he gets outta hand. What about the judge? There's a way of fixing him too. I've got too much at stake to let anyone spoil it for me. Breed, put those sparrows back in the cage. Hiya, whopper. Hiya, whopper. Howdy, Lem. Jim! You're a sight for sore eyes. Glad to see you, boys. Mighty glad. I knew if anybody in this town hasn't changed, it would be you. Oh, I've changed alright, got a couple boys workin' the store for me now. But, uh, they don't talk so much. Well, that's too bad. But I'll bet you're getting your share of the gold around these parts. Well, to tell you the truth, Gorman, the owner of the Red Dog Saloon is gettin' most of it. Well, what about Snicker Joe's gold strike? Oh, he's still digging it out. Well, I'm mighty glad to hear that. Say, have you seen any thing of my punches around here? You'll find them scattered all over town, and the slickers are sure taking 'em over. I was kinda afraid of that. - See you later, Lem. - So long. Hi, whopper. Now right there is the mother lode. And where you see that "X", that's the claim I'm givin' you a chance to buy. Why, you ain't never had an opportunity like this before in your life. And if you don't buy right now, you'll never have another one. Why, son, that claim will make you a millionaire. Gee, that's sure nice of you, mister. Now all you have to do is put your name on the dotted lines. Gee, thanks. - What're you doing here, Pete? - Well, I was just-- Now, you get back to the ranch where you belong, and stay there. What's the idea of trying to sell one of my cowhands a claim in the middle of the river? Why, you got a lotta nerve interfering with me when I'm putting over a big mining deal. Now you get outta here, or I'll throw ya out. - You'll do what? - I said I'll throw you out! Come on, wait a minute. I-- I-- I was only... I-- I was only... Wait a minute. You can't do a thing like this to me, mister. You can't do this to me. Please, let me outta here. I didn't mean what I said. Take me down of it. Oh! Now, wa-- wait a minute there, will you? Oh, mister, please, come back here. Will ya take me down? This a fine predicament for a man to be in. Come here, will you? Help! Help! Help! Help! Hi, whopper. Hiya, whopper. I'll raise you 20. Too much for me. I'll boost you ten. I'll have to call you. Four aces. No good. Straight flush. Wait a minute. That deuce don't make it a straight flush. We're playin' deuces wild. Nothin' was said about it at the beginning of the game. - Oh, yeah. - Leave that pot where it is? Pick it up, Nevada, it belongs to you, and get outta here. Drop that gun. Get those hands up. - Look out, Jim! - Look out! Break his neck! Come on! Hiya, whopper. Alright, you cowhands, let's get outta here. I ought to break both of your necks. What for? We didn't do nothin'. I get back to the ranch and I find my stock scattered all over the country. And where do I find you two? Just like the rest of the outfits, in bad company. We're sorry, Jim, for lettin' you down like that. About all I can say is, I'm sorry. - Where do you suppose Banjo is? - Well, I don't know. He's been dodgin' in and out of doors here so much that even I can't keep up with him. Come on, let's see if we can round him up. Hiya, whopper. If ain't our fine-lookin' ranch foreman. Do you see what I see? Let me loose! Let me out! Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where do you think you're going? Hello, Jim. That's funny. I've been lookin' all over town for you. Just one more trip in that pawn shop, and you'd be running 'round here in a barrel. That's just it. Where do we go from here? Home, to the ranch. Boys, get our horses while I get this coyote's clothes. My horse is in Hawk's delivery stable. Ladies and gents... tomorrow morning Ridgeville will witness its first jury trial as prescribed in the laws of this territory... with His Honor, Judge Harkins, sitting on the bench. Now, everything is going to be fair and square, and as I pull the names out of this hat and read them, those men are to appear here tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock for jury duty. Mr. Gorman seems anxious to cooperate with me. It'll make it easier for you, dad. Yeah. If I ever catch you cowhands in this town again without my consent, I'm gonna run you out of the territory. Now, get on back to the ranch as fast as those horses will take you. Bill Anderson. Harry McCoy. Owen. Is he here? Fine, Gorman. - Oh, glad to see you again. - Thank you, ma'am. What is he doing, wrapping off something? No. Gorman's picking me a jury for the trial in the morning. - Oh, that's it. - You'll be there, won't you? You won't disappoint us? Hey, 'bout coming over to our house for dinner tonight? You know, make it sort of a house warming. - I'm sure Millie wouldn't mind. - Oh, of course not. I'd love to have you. You sure it isn't too much trouble? No. No. Not at all. Lloyd Kirk. And Alfred Barnes. Now, don't forget, men, report here 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. That's all. Thank you. Well, judge, your jury's all ready. I appreciate that, Gorman. - Some jury too. - Huh? Well, judge, I got to be going. - I'll see you tonight. - You won't forget. Just let someone try and keep me away. Just a minute, Bannister. What's on your mind, Gorman? I understand you've caused a lotta trouble around my place this afternoon. No more trouble than was necessary with a bunch of crooks. Now, don't forget, we're gonna have some law around here from now on. And if you happen to get reckless with that gun of yours, it might not be so healthy for you. So, why don't you go on up to your ranch and stay there? Maybe I will... after the trial. Looks like we gonna have a little law and order from now on. I hope so. This town ain't safe to live in. Mr. Bannister, can you identify the two men who tried to hold up the Ridgeville stage yesterday morning? Yes, sir. Will you point them out, please? Those are the two men right there, sir. How do you know they're the men? I should know. I caught 'em in the act and brought 'em in. Judge, let's hear what the driver has to say. Mr. Stockholm, will you please tell the jury just what happened? Well, the way I figured it, those men, those fellas that Jim Bannister shot, well, they were shot by mistake. As far as I can figure out, they were just tryin' to get a ride into town. Order! Silence! Or I'll clear the courtroom. Never in all my life have I heard such unmitigated, barefaced lying. Gentlemen of the jury, are you going to believe the testimony of this obviously intimidated witness? Just a minute, judge. You can't be telling a jury what they're to believe. They've got to decide that for themselves. Alright, gentlemen, you may retire and bring in your verdict. Well, judge, we don't figure we have to retire in a case like this. We've just taken a vote among ourselves and our verdict is: not guilty. Court adjourned! Justice. Well, Judge, it looks like you're up against a pretty tough proposition. The next time, I'll have a hand in the pickin' of the jury and then I'll guarantee, we'll get an honest verdict. We've got to get the judge and Jim Bannister out of this community or we're outta luck. The only place in the town that's doing any business is the jail and most of my men are in it. Who do you think we oughta start on first? If you want my advice, I'd settle with Bannister first. Alright, tell Greg to handle it. Right. Flip and flop and flip and flop And flip and flop On the trail of tomorrow There'll be screams around each bend Cattle thieves won't steal The rushes will be real And every cowboy Your friend On the trail of tomorrow There'll be moss On every stone And each breeze will sigh An oldies lullaby And there'll be no nights Alone The wagon wheels Of time will turn Along the trail to the sky They'll roll along Until they reach The land where springs are never dry On the trail of tomorrow Every broken heart will mend At each sunset's glow We'll find the ranch we know Until we reach tomorrow's end The wagon wheels Of time will turn Along the trail to the sky They'll roll along Until they reach The land where springs Are never dry On the trail of tomorrow Every broken heart will mend Will mend At each sunset's glow We'll find the ranch we know Until we reach tomorrow's end Oh, what a gorgeous view. It is kind of pretty, isn't it? Would you like to walk out to the edge and look around? Oh, I'd love to. How far is your ranch from here, Jim? Oh, I don't know. Not very far. Jim... I hate to burden you with my troubles but... I've been worried about dad lately. Why, you shouldn't worry about him. He's doing a great job of cleaning up the town. He's got a lot of spunk too. Well, that's just it, he's been fighting back and I don't know what'll happen to him. I haven't told you this, but... our lives have been threatened several times. - Gorman? - Yes. Jim, I'd feel a lot safer if you'd move into town for a couple of days. Why, sure, if it'd make you any happier, I'd be glad to. Oh, I don't know how to thank you. Now don't you worry about that. Well, that stopped one of 'em. Now to get the other one out in the open. Here. You take this. And keep up the firing. I'm gonna try to sneak around in back of him. You better head for town and get that hand taken care of. I can handle this. - Who sent you here? - Wouldn't you like to know? Oh, so that's the game you wanna play, huh? Well, I'm takin' you into town. Now, get on that horse. Hold it. Now get off that horse and keep your hands in the air. Keep your hand on your desk, Gorman. I thought I told you to stay outta town. Listen, you three. I don't mind being ambushed. Sometimes, I think it's fun. But I don't think it's fun when there's a lady along. Now, listen, I'm gonna tell you three birds something. Fine, it's been a dull day. Maybe we could stand a few laughs. Well, here's the first laugh, partner. I'm giving you just 24 hours to close up that crooked gambling joint of yours and get out of town. And who do you think you are tellin' us what to do? I'll leave that for you to decide, Gorman. But just remember this. Twenty-four hours. Well, what happened now? He just got the best of me. We've got to use different methods to get rid of that fella. Well, I got something that I think'll work. Suppose the judge and his daughter decided to leave town for a couple of days, and Bannister knew where they were... do you think he'd be interested enough in a girl to pay them a visit? Yeah. I see what you mean. We kill three birds with one stone. See who it is, dear. Keep quiet. Now get over there with your father. What's the meaning of this? Do as you're told, judge, and you won't get hurt. Now sit down and write a little note for us. Dear Jim... Millie and I... are spending a couple of days... Note from the judge. You want to send back any word? Wait till I see what it says. Nope, that's all. What's the matter, Jim, somethin' gone haywire? Read this. Nevada, I want you to round up all the boys and meet me the edgeof Ridgeville in two hours. And bring plenty of ammunition. What're you gonna do? I've given Gorman and his bunch of cut-throats 24 hours to get out of town. That note sound like a frame up and I'm calling his hand. You sure you don't want one of us to go with you? - No, I better go alone. - You know best. Are you sure there's only one trail leads into this place? Yes. And I'm watchin' it. It's about time Bannister was showin' up. The sooner the better for me. Dad, I pray Jim doesn't show up here. Well, I hate to... What was that? It must be Jim. Jim, when I heard the shot, I was afraid they gotcha. Listen, judge, we've got to get out of here quick and head for town. Alright. That 24-hour deal with Bannister is about up, ain't it, Gorman? I don't think he'll bother us anymore. See that your guns are loaded, boys. As soon as the boss gets here, they'll be plenty of action. I was sure prayin' for you, boss. Judge, you and Millie better stay here. There's liable to be some gunplay. Alright, boys, let's go. Bannister and the Circle X boys are in town and they mean business. I thought you told me that Bannister got that note from the judge. Well, he did, that guy's got more lives than a cat. Tip off our men and be quick about it. There ain't anybody left to fight with, boss. What do we do now? We'll round up his gang and get 'em outta town. Jim! Well, judge, the town's all yours. Thanks, pal. Flop and flip flop and flip Flop and flip flop On the trail of tomorrow There'll be streams around each bend Cattle thieves won't steal My rushes will be real And every cowboy your friend On the trail of tomorrow There'll be moss On every stone And each breeze will sigh Your oldest lullaby And there'll be no nights Alone The wagon wheels Of time will turn Along the trail to the sky They'll roll along Until they reach The land where springs are never dry On the trail of tomorrow Every broken heart will mend At each sunset's glow We'll find the ranch we know Until we reach tomorrow's end
