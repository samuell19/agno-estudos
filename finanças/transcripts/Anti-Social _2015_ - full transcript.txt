You didn't tell me you were gonna meet me here. You mentioned where the shoot was. I thought I'd surprise ya. How was it, then? Um... it was good. It was just basic. But I've been here since 8:00 in the morning, so... just a little tired. Oh, yeah, I was out at 4:00 this morning with Jason. All right, my dear... Which way? Wanna bus it or Tube it? No need. They sent a car for me. Come on, look. He's right there. Guess what? You are probably gonna meet - my mum and brother next week. - You invited them? I'm so excited. OK, tell me about them. All right, um... My mum's quite chilled. She sits around getting stoned most of the time. - OK. - And then my brother... - He's very different than I am. - And? Uh, all right. Um... My mum came over from Spain when she was 18. She met Marcus's dad, who was actually over there visiting his mates. Then she ended up moving back to London with him. Me and Marcus have got different dads, you see? - Oh, I didn't know that. - Yeah, yeah. Marcus's dad was killed not long after Marcus was born. He did a bank robbery and the car he was in got run off the road by the Old Bill. Oh, my God. What about your dad? I don't know much about him. Oh... Go on, son! Get in there! What's happening, boys? What a result, man. - Came in nice, yeah. - Sweet. Fifty grand. Said a couple of watches were a bit too rare. Here, Nick, get your bloke to melt 'em down. - You got a buyer for the stones? - Of course. I swear, this is the last time I'm buying a round. - No change? - Stop being tight, man. Ah, flippin' hell. - Could have given you the drink. - Thanks. It's all a joke. - Hold on, you seen this? - What's that? Wait, I know him, years ago in Feltham, bruv. We was on the same wing. From Canning Town, good geezer. Well, it says here... "Armed police ambushed a smash-and-grab gang last night as they battered through the windows of a jeweller's in Northfield shopping centre, East London. Scotland Yard said this was a proactive operation by the Flying Squad into an organized criminal network involving smash-and-grab robbers. The Flying Squad, nicknamed the Sweeney... Fuckin' Sweeney. ...have been deployed to target smash-and-grab raiders after a series of long-running attacks on luxury stores across London." What else it say? "...in custody of magistrates next week." That's them Canning Town boys I saw on the news this morning. They got proper fucked by someone. Hey, look, it says the Old Bill had intelligence. They've been grassed, mate. There ain't no other way. On the other hand, maybe they just got a bit sloppy. I'm always saying we've gotta keep a low profile. Hello, Mum, you in? Yeah, I'm here. - Hello. You all right? - Hi. Yeah, I'm starving again. Have you eaten, baby? No, I'm all right, I ate earlier. Listen, Mum... I think I'm gonna move out for a little bit, maybe for good. That's great, baby. Where are you moving into? - What's the plan? - I'm moving in with the Delhams. - Kirsten? - Yeah. She's got a place over in the East End, and I thought it would be good for a while. Tell me everything about her. I want to know everything. We need to find Dominic a bird. I don't need a girl, man. Too much effort. I'm happy being free and single. Hey, I never got the elbow. I just don't wanna... Shh! Them pricks over there... I swear that's them pussies. Do they wanna say something? Fucking West Grove boys. Leon and that flash cunt Junior need to fuck right off. - They think they're too heavy. - Proper idiots. Fuckin' pussies! Should put both of 'em in the fucking ground. They got all the dealers in this manor now. Span the whole area now, top to bottom. Last few months, every single shot's been buying from them. - What? - What? Fuckin' hell, mate. That's well good. - Cheers. - Here, got that for you. Oh, nice one. So, how's it all going, this art thing you're doing? Yeah. It's all right. I'm really proud of you, you know. I mean that. I know, bruv. So, what are you working on? Same old, really. Doin' my thing with the boys. - You should slow down a bit. - No, mate, never. I got big plans. I see you're full on with smashing the system, then. Against this and that. Yeah, pretty much what you're doing. Confronting authority, challenging society. Fuck the authorities, but I don't want society brought down. Otherwise there'd be nothing for me to go and blag. Surprise! - Hey! - What are you doin' here? What do you think I'm doing here? Hey! S! - Whaddya say, Dee? - What's going on, Shaun? What's that you're wearing? Is that aftershave? No, mate, deodorant. Fuckin' hell, bruv, you're caked in it. - All right, later, yeah. - Yeah, laters. - All right, boys. Yo, Kerry. - What's happening, brother? - Hey. - Long time, Dee. Never see you around these days. I keep my head down. Workin' on my shit. All over east, I here That's good to hear, man. Brother's over there, man. All right, sweet. Laters, yeah? - Yeah. - Behave, yourself, yeah?

Shut up, can't have you runnin' out of dough, take it. I got a few quid on me already. Especially takin' out a bird. Enjoy your night. - Thanks, I appreciate it. - I know you do. Talk later. - Kirsten, can we get a photo? - Oh, my God, of course, yeah! Kevin, my boyfriend, Dee. Come! Just one second. Hi! Thank you! That is secret love. I've gotta go. My car is downstairs. - OK, have a good one. - Mm-hmm. I've gotta get up, too. I'm working this morning. - What time you back? - Probably late, I'll text you. I'll fetch my stuff over this evening, all right? Great! - Bye. - Bye. All right? You're so beautiful. You know that? Yeah, I know. Got much happening this week? Yeah, got a few things to check out on Oxford Street. And I still gotta get them outfits. Anyway, I'm gonna stay at my gaff for the rest of the week. Don't want to be seen in and out of here too much. Yeah, of course. Shout me later if you want me to come over. Yeah, of course I do. Love ya. For years, luxury stores faced an onslaught of attacks by robbers who used cars for ram-raiding, but those who specialize in high-end targets have now found other ways: motorbikes. Ten a.m., Blue Cross Shopping Centre, North London. This clip shows the moment a motorbike gang sped into the centre and targeted jewellers H Silverman. A security guard is forced to leap out of the way by a robber waving an axe, as three others smashed through the shop's windows and grabbed watches and jewellery worth up to Â£300,000. The four robbers, dressed in black jumpsuits... - All right. - Got everything you need? Yeah. ...scattering shoppers in terror. Scotland Yard's Flying Squad... - Gimme a call. - Yeah, of course. - See you at Graff Jam. - That graffiti thing? - Yeah, the weekend. Sweet. - See you later. Make sure we're all invited to the wedding, yeah? - Bye, baby. - Bye-bye. - Call me. Bye! - Ta-ra. ...engines running and intimidating shoppers. The raid took less than two minutes. Yo! Yo, can you hear me? Do I know you? Fuck that bitch, man. Fuck that, anyway. Fuckin' bint. I know you from somewhere, don't I? Do ya? Yeah. That's it, you're with them West Grove boys, ain't ya? I know them, but I ain't "with them." OK. Look, what is your name? Michelle. Ah, yeah. That's the one. Michelle, yeah. I thought so. Right. So what is up with those West Grove fools? They're from my area, innit? That's all. Ain't nothin' to do with me. They're grassers, they talked to Trident, innit? One of my cousins is doing time 'cause of them. Well, the only good police grass is a dead police grass. Exactly. They're fuckin' fools. You used to go with that Leon, too, right? Yeah, a time ago. He's just a boy in a man's body. Trust me. What's wrong? Yeah? OK. Check this out, new music, good music. Courtesy of Leroy and the Five Heartbeats, man. This is big. Turn it up. I need to get back down my way soon. - We'll smoke this first, yeah? - OK. - See you again, though, right? - Yeah. Definitely. - Turkish coffee. - Cheers, pal. Uh, ladies, what can I get for you? Ugggh! Evacuate the building. Evacuate the building. Evacuate the building. This is not a drill. This is not a drill. Evacuate the building. Evacuate the building. Evacuate the building. This is not a drill. - Hey, motherfucker! - Fuck sake! Hold the bastard down! Call the fucking police! Hey, get off him! - Shit! - Call the fucking police! Ugggh! - Get on the fucking bike! - I'm on. Dee! - Dee! - What's wrong with your phone? Freakin' cut me off again. Incoming calls only. I'll be down in one minute. Listen, babe, I'm gonna shoot out for a little while. Want me to pick you up later? No, but I will call you after my dinner. - Have a good time, yeah? - Goodbye. Mm! Where are you going? Come here. - All right, bye. - Bye. Yeah, he's here at mine. I'll just get him. Yeah, I'm all right. Here he is. Shaun. - Who is it? - It's mum for you. Central London was rocked this evening when a daredevil gang attacked one of the capital's most prestigious department stores. Nigel Cooke has the latest live from Oxford Street. Patrons and staff at this West End department store had little idea just 20 minutes prior to closure that the day would end in horror. That's when three men dressed in burkas posing as female customers produced an arsenal of axes and hammers and smashed their way through glass security cabinets. Their target: designer watches. Witnesses explained how the smashing glass sounded like gunshots, sending both customers and staff running for cover. Others said they thought it was a terrorist attack. A 29-year-old man was rushed to hospital with a head wound after he was struck with a hammer by one of the gang after pursuing one of the robbers. He's now said to be in stable but serious condition. Good, you fuckin' slag. Detectives from Scotland Yard's Flying Squad have recovered a motorcycle used in the raid and are now pursuing evidence. Pursuing evidence? Them dogs ain't got nothing. Bike's untraceable, anyway. We should ease off for a bit, Let the Old Bill run out of steam. - They don't know us. - Listen. We're sitting on a nice sum of dough... What's up? We're off, yeah? - What did mum want? - Nothing, just to talk to me. Where are you off to? Just gonna go get Lena with my lot. Don't bring no heat on this doorstep, understand? Course I won't. "Lena with my lot." So, what's Kirsten up to tonight? Some dinner with her agency. Did they forget our invites, yeah? Oh, wicked, this is it? - This'll do. - Want some help, mate? No, I'm all right. Be sure to put that back. - Oh, man. - Yo, just here is fine. Thanks, man. I love it. Oh, man. It's proper heavy reach as well. You can see it from three different points down there. Oh! - Oh, man! - Come on. I saw it when I was doing a bike drop down there. I looked up and I was like, "Fuck, yeah!" That's gonna look sick. - Jason. - Yeah. Give us a hand, mate. This way, mate. We're likely to get 50 grand apiece for the job today. Right? My thing is this. We put the lot in with our whacks from the shopping mall. That's about 220 grand altogether, guessing what everyone's already spent. Yeah, about 220, and we invest all of it in a load of sniff. That sounds proper. I'm involved. Moving away from robbery, we can triple that 220 in a few weeks, just by squeezing out those West Grove dealers alone. - Exactly. - Who do you wanna buy from? - Chris Regan. - Wanna deal with the Regans? Yeah, of course. Chris runs his own thing. His uncles and my old man did blags together in the '80s. So I know Chris, and I'm tight with him. Sweet. Branch out. All right, let's do it. Sit back and earn some easy dough for a while, yeah? Oh, man, you see you go down Bethnal Green till you see our artwork. It's the best. You'll find the best locations. The highest points. There's stuff you won't even know till you get to. Yeah, all right, nice! Oi! Where's your stencil? I'll cut you another one. Shut up, it's all right. Aw, princess! Piss off, there. - You finished, then? - Yeah, all done. Listen, mate, give me your number and I'll call you if there's any Old Bill with security downstairs. - Ready to leave, yeah? - Yeah, ready to roll. Sweet. Dee, come in! Come in. How are you doing? - How are you, good? - I'm good, I'm fine. I've just got to pop downstairs to get a bottle of wine. Philip's just finishing up. Go and make yourself at home. - I'll be two minutes. - Sweet. See you in a minute. Just keep your head up a little. Ah, great to meet you again, Dee. - Thanks for coming by. - Yeah, you too, Philip. - Thanks for inviting me over. - Take your coat off. - Have a seat. - Yeah, cheers. I saw a great piece of street art today off Hackney Road. It had a line of riot police, and next to them was a life-size street cleaner with a jet hose washing them off the wall. Caption read, "Just a thin blue line." - Yeah, it's one of mine. - Thought it might have been. I really loved how it was done layered, both visually and in the wordplay. Yeah, well I like working that way. Um, lots of layers, you know. That's how I see life. - You know what I mean? - Yeah. I didn't know that was still there. Too right it's still there. Let me get some wine glasses. So, Dee, we were chatting earlier, and Philip was asking me how you started out. Well, uh, basically, when I was a kid, I used to run around with my brother and our mates. We were what you might call a little gang. And I used to go around the area and tag our name, which was obviously really important to all of us. And then if we went into another neighbourhood, that was a must-do thing, really. But then I was really into the art side of it, so I started doing other stuff which wasn't just tagging. - Then it kicked off from there. - Yeah. Oh, Rita. Thank you for coming. See you tomorrow, bye. It's amazing, isn't it? What started out in New York in the 1970s as a criminal offense is now becoming a national art form. Even when you started out, it was seen as vandalism. It's still seen like that by a lot of people. Sure it is, but look, we have graffiti art fetching six figure sums in some galleries. In London as well as Berlin. What did he say? He does his banking every Thursday. Laundering his weed money using his chauffeur's cover, so he has to keep the same routine. He keeps it in the back office, in one safe, no hiding places? Yeah, all in the safe with the shop's takings. Sounds about right. Nice one, Michelle. See you later, yeah? Laters, yeah. - Be careful, all right? - Of course. - What are youse lot reckoning? - To be honest, I ain't keen. I'm still surprised that you're mixing up with a bird from over the West Grove. I told you, she's got nothing to do with those West Grove pricks. This blag that she's putting up is right on her doorstep. It's in her manor. She's sweet. And she knows nothing about us, just that we're grafters. Now, fair play: it's good that she lined up the job and that, but I thought we was knockin' risks like this on the head. We don't need to be doing this with everything coming up soon. A blag like this is street level. - What's the point? - Fuck it, it's sitting there. Who's the geezer gonna complain to, anyway? The way I see it, it's just a nice little touch. So, what do you reckon? Tell me, how do you make your living? Have you sold any work? - No. Well, I mean, I don't... - So, how do you get by? Well, I do motorbike couriering when I can. And my brother helps me out, too. He's a good boy like that. - This your man here, yeah? - Yeah, that's him. Karim. He's got a fucking bird with him. Looks like a prost, doesn't it? Fuck sake. So should we split or what? 21,000. 40, 60, 80... 22 grand. Fucking hell. Skunk makes my life easy. Put on some music, huh? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Good choice. - Yeah! - You feelin' frisky? Ask your friend, huh? If you would want... Yeah. I've got a lot of work, darling. Still got a lot of work to do. OK, why not? Why not? Yeah, get it right in there. Fuckin' hell! Stay there. Stay down or I'll blow your head off! Think you're bad men, yeah? - I'll find you, believe me! - Shut up, man! Get down! I'm gonna find out where you all's fucking live! Oh, please. You don't know who I am! Now, be a good boy and shut up, eh?! I suppose a blow job for me's out of the question, yeah? Fuck you! Where are you from? What country? Where the hell are you from? Good, let's go. You, up, up! Down! Face down! Stay! Get down there! Fucking hell. Shut up. You slut. I'll slap your arse as well. Don't do that, please! Aside from this mainstream collision, do you think that street art still has a rebellious edge? Oh, definitely, yeah. You know, I strongly maintain that graffiti... satirical street art like yours... is majorly important. It's important because it allows people, it sometimes forces people, to see life in different terms. Even if it just makes people open up their eyes for a few moments, it's worth its weight in gold. - How's that one, good? - Yeah, I got it. Perfect. I'll come here in 5 or 10 minutes? OK, cool. Hey! Hey, what's up? You know, I was meeting those art people today? Yeah, the German guy and that really cool chick from the Graffiti Jam. Yeah? He's one of the guys that runs the Berlin Contemporary Art Show. He's laid it on the table: he likes what I do and wants me to be the British representative for the show. Would you move there with me? Dee. Come on, you always say you can work from wherever. Half the jobs you do abroad anyway. Of course! Yes! Been in this place before? No, Jason. Hold the queue till you get more spenders, right? Dee! What's up, brother? Getting something from the car. Everyone else is inside, man. Hey, Nicky! She's with me, yeah? Dee. Hi! Good to see you! Hi. Kirsten. Nice to meet you. Can I have a bottle, yeah? - You all right? - Yeah. All right, Dee? Michelle, Michelle! - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Hey! - Here you are. - Thanks, yeah. - Nicky, where's Kerry tonight? - She's working tonight, man. - Where does she work? - She's a table dancer. Stripper. Nice! That's all right, I'll do it. Don't worry about it. From the two gentlemen at the bar. Listen to me, I just wanna say well done. Guy in Berlin's gonna be impressed. Well done, mate. - You all right? Having fun. - Mm! Yeah! It's like being in a music video. There's a few grand to stick in your pocket. Knock that courier job on the head and focus on Berlin. - You sure? - We had a nice touch yesterday. And I got something big coming up. Sweet. What's good, baby? Junior, my friend. What can I get you? Let me get a table over there, please. See what I'm saying? Come on. Well, look who's there. Leon's old side chick, you know. Fucking with that fuckwad, look at her. Look who's just dropped in. What's the matter? Let you look at my dick. - Second-hand slag. - What's up? Has he got a fucking problem? - He's a fucking psycho. - All right. - What are you saying? - What do you mean? - What are you saying? - What am I saying? Yeah, you heard. - I'm saying you're a pussy. - Really? Yeah, you feelin' it, yeah? - Fuck you! - Get off of me! Calm down! Calm down! I know you, you know. I know you! Slag, you can suck my cock! Don't ever forget that! Fuck off! - You fuck! - I'll shoot you in the head! - You prick! You dickhead! - Fuck you! You're fucking dead! You're a pussy! What you wanna do? I ain't worried, 'cause you're a faggot! Fuck. I hate violence, you know? I'm from a sleepy little beach town outside of L.A. and I am... I'm just not used to that. Yeah. I don't like violence either, it's bullshit. Yeah, it scares me, too. Yeah. Well, I'm glad you don't hang out with your brother and those dudes, you know? Don't want them pulling you down. Kirsten, they do not pull me down. I don't mean it like that. I like your brother. I like his friends, they're cool, but... Look, you've got to put it in perspective, all right? See, the men they attacked, they are nasty people. When we were younger, they put 45 stitches in Dominic's back. - You know why? - No. 'Cause he visited his gran who lived in the same postcode. It's bullshit. All of it is wrong. But that's how it is and I hate it. I know you've had to climb a mountain to get away from this crap and see life for what it can be. You inspire me. I appreciate that. You're doing something with your life. And I just... I want you to know that I'm by your side. - OK? - Yeah, no problem. How you been keeping, well? Everything's going really good right now, Chris. - That's what I like to hear. - Cheers, mate. Right. I got 300k's worth for you here. 300? Chris, I said 220. Yeah, I know, but if you want 220, it means I've got to cut a box in half. Who am I gonna sell half a key to? 300's a nice round number. Now you can take the six or stay with the five. - I'm happy either way. - Let's take the six. Good man. You owe us 80 on the reloads, yeah? All right, done. How's your mum? Yeah, yeah, she's fine. Give her my regards when you see her. You seeing that little blond bird? Yeah, I am, actually. It's been there a while. Yeah, it's been years. Get married, will ya? Have some kids. Give your mum grandchildren. She'd love that. No, not yet. Nick and Kwame here? Nah, they chipped off when we got back. Said they'd be here about now, actually. All went well. It's safely tucked away. What's up? - Went all right, yeah? - Yeah, sweet. - And he credited us 80 grand. - Eighty grand? Yeah. So that's 300 altogether? Yeah, 300, a nice round number. - Where is it? - At the house, nice and safe. All right, but we've got to keep our heads down a few days. - Then we start looking out. - Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that is definitely a good shot. Best idea you've had all year, man. - Look at these. - Having fun? - Hey, Dee! - Hello. How are you doing? Great to see you again. Yeah, you, too. Hello, babe. - You all right? - Good, how are you? Hold on for a second. When did the council do this? Fuck knows. Must have been the last few days, I reckon. You don't seem happy about it. No, no, I am, but it feels like a sell-out, know what I mean? No. Absolutely not. This is an accreditation. You said this piece is multi-layered, right? What, the Perspex adds another layer, yeah? Yes, it does, it actually... works perfectly. Hey. - That's very cool. - Isn't it? - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. Shaun, go get the door. No, man, I'm right in the middle of this... Uggh! Get down! Down! Fuckin' pussy! Ugh! Get the fuck off me! Ohhh! Quiet down. - Shut the fuck up! - Fuck off! Make that fucking slut be quiet as well. You're being a fucking cuntful, shut up! Aaaah! Ohhh! - Where the fuck is the food? - Fuck! Are you stupid? Are you fucking stupid? The only fucking reason I ain't killed you right now is 'cause my man wants answers, you fuckin' prick! Shut the fuck up! Leon can't do his own work! You pussy! - Where's the food?! - I don't fucking know! Where's the food? There's 300 grand worth of sniff in this flat. You're not gonna say where the food is, yeah? No problem. Burn him. That's good. Watch. He's gonna burn to the bone. Shut up! Shut up! Just tell us where the fucking drugs are and we'll leave. I don't know what you're fucking talking about, you dick! You're gonna get topped, the lot of you! By you, huh? Kwame? And Marcus, what the fuck are those pussy holes gonna do? You tell me where's their fucking food and we'll go. If not, I'm gonna drop both your knickers and fuck the pair of ya. We're gonna run a train on you, then on you. Don't play games with me, Emma. You know me. Where the fuck is the food? You wanna play like that, yeah? Hold her down, hold her down! Oi, I'm going first. You ever been to jail before? I seen a man's face peel off right in front of my two fucking eyes. It was like a mask. Running around the jail screaming like a little bitch. And then he just passed out. Shock. Face nowhere to be seen. Yo, yo, yo, relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. You ain't goin' anywhere, man. Your sister sounds like a good fuck, man. She wants to be a gangster. Them men don't give a shit. They'll fuck her all night. - No! - I'm serious. Shut up, you bint! You see, this loyalty game you're playing... give up. Give it up straightaway. 'Cause I know for a fact the big stash is in this house somewhere. And you're going to tell me exactly where it is, 'cause no matter how much money them pricks are paying you to stay silent, it's no use to you now, bro. It's no use to you now. You want to head back northwest, few drinks at Emma's? No, let's go on a long run, M20 to Dover. All right, sweet. All right, fuck it. Hey, hold the fucking bitch, yeah? It's Marcus. Yeah, hello.

It's... kind of a going-away present. - Serious? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mate, I could do so much with this stuff. That's why I want you to have it, bro. Thank you, pal. No worries. When are you going away, anyway? - End of next week. - Fucking hell. Kirsten's buzzing, so am I. You lucky git. You ain't got any phones on ya, have ya? Course not. Pull up a chair. Relax. You know who I am? This is Tim, one of my cousins. So... you got robbed, then. Yeah, everything. They took the whole lot. And they took some very bad fucking liberties when they was doing it. The firm that got shot up on the West End the other night? Had to be done, there and then. No chance of getting the sniff back. And I've heard that that mob is looking for you. and they ain't gonna give up. A few others from other firms got caught up in the crossfire. But it was the only way. You probably got half the gangs in West London after you. Fuck 'em, Chris, they come for me, they know what they'll get. What about the Old Bill? We're all lying low. None of us are about. Everyone's tucked away. I don't mean to be the bearer of more ball-ache for you, but some Asian fella reckons you lot have done his safe, giving him a kicking and tried it on with his missis. He's put up a lot of dough to have youse ironed out. Some bird grassed you up, apparently. Anyway, luckily for you, he approached a couple of fellas that work for us. So you got a bit of breathing space. Just bear in mind they will try elsewhere sooner or later. OK? Maybe a firm from over the river, maybe a firm from up north. I suppose we could just take the money he's stakin' up, tell him we buried them under the motorway, split it two ways and you stop buying your fags in his corner shop, eh? Listen, we're fucked. All the money we had went into the sniff we bought. Aren't you forgetting something? Yeah, and your 80. I'm sorry about that, mate. I promise you I'll get that back, I swear. We ain't got a penny now and we need a heavy score. To get back to where we was. And if need be, put those fucking West Grove dealers out of business for good. That's why I brought Tim along today. He's got details on something you might be interested in. What is it? It's a big job. Serious amount of money to be made. But it ain't smash-and-grab. This is firearms, full planning. Chris said that youse could handle it. But I ain't gonna stick it up to you, if you're then gonna turn around and say no. No, we're up for it. Right, we'll fence the goods for a 20% commission. And we get 10% of the overall for stickin' the job up. Done. Kraffs, the jewellers on Bond Street. They're gonna have a consignment of special gems... diamonds, gold jewellery... within the next week or so. You're looking at a face value of at least 20 million quid. Thank you. Very good. Nice, mate. - Cheers. - Yeah, cheers. Your flights are booked. For both you and Kirsten. Oh, thank you, Philip. We would have bought Kirsten's ticket ourselves. No bother, we have a deal with the airline. The office should email them today. Sweet. I'll text Kirsten so she knows. I think you'll like the flat they've found for you. Sorry you couldn't view it first. No, no, I'm grateful. This is New Bond Street. There's Kraffs. Taxi pulls up, me and Dom are gonna get out and walk in there like we're customers. You all right with that? Yeah, yeah, of course. But it has to be convincing. They don't just let anyone in there. So where's the goods? The shop's on two floors. The top floor is where the jeweller sits with clients. Downstairs on the lower floor, that's where the cabinets are. That's where the new gear is. I'll keep everyone upstairs: the jeweller, the security guard and anyone else. All the cabinets are finger key locked. Take the blond bird down there and she'll open all of them. And I'm going to be waiting here or thereabouts. As close to the shop as possible. There's a 90-second police response time. And Chris is going to be up there, and it's a one-way street, so the police can only get in from this direction. And, Nicky, I need you to be there on the block. Don't worry, I'll be there. You all right, brother? Yeah, I'm.... cool. Got a few things on my mind. I'll be an hour and we'll go through the plans again. - Where were we, bro? - See you in a bit, yeah? - Keep your eyes open, yeah? - Yeah, of course, mate. Fuck! Uggh! - Did you write him off? - Yeah, it's done. Marcus! Everything OK? Dr Carson, Dr Wells... - Stand back there, son. - My brother's in there! He's my son. Three entry wounds, three exits, immediate transfer. - What's happening? - We're taking him into theatre. I told him not to come and see me. Said they'd be watching. Come on, let's go. Excuse me, mate. Excuse me. Detective Sergeant Baxter from Trident, anti-gang gun unit. - Can I have a word? - I don't know nothing. Now, we can have a private chat in the car or we can talk in the nearest nick. I think you should probably just go with him. Fine. Meet me in that cafe at the corner. Yeah, of course. What's your relationship to Marcus Kenan? I'm his brother. Darren Kenan. Who do you think shot him? I ain't got no fucking idea. You'll have to do better than that. Well, there was a shooting last week. Two of the West Grove crew got killed. Your brother's name's been mentioned, along with the names of his three known associates. I'm not involved in that world, so I can't help you. And my brother is basically a straight guy, that's all I can tell you. Well, let me tell you something. Your brother and his three mates are wanted men, and if we don't nick them first, they're dead. We'll be waiting for Marcus when he recovers, but if Dominic, Nicky, and Kwame want to reach old age as free men, they need to come and see me because believe me, the other lot will turn Queen's evidence the first chance they get. Hello? Kwame up. - Be quick, yeah? - All right. Right, I need to leave you here, all right? Is everything OK? Fine. I just need to go somewhere. - I'll be back soon. - OK. We're doing a job in two days. You gotta be joking. The Old Bill got a squad out looking for the three of you. With the heat on you now, boys, you better bury yourselves. But, Dee, this is a once-in-a-lifetime score. We're talking millions each, big league. I don't even want to know about that. You're missing the point. It's gonna be enough money for us to just dust, get out. Disappear. To be honest with you, we ain't got any other options. We'll have enough to pay for some people we know to break Marcus out of hospital. Marcus is under armed guard. No one is busting Marcus out, period. The second he's moved, he's to be banged up pending trial. Then we'll bust him out of the van on his way to court. All right, look. Let's say Marcus does get sent down. Are you telling me you don't want your brother to have three and a half mill waiting for him when he gets released? Dom, what are you telling me for? We need you to be the fourth man. The job can't be done without four of us, it's been planned. There were some heavy people involved, but it's our job on the ground. There ain't no one else we can trust to bring in. You run drugs. Think what you're asking me. I wouldn't even know what to do. My brother's all shot up, looking at 25 years. Dees, listen, there's no other option. Otherwise we're dead. We need the money for protection. Your brother needs the money, or trust me, he's as good as topped already. We're all on hit lists. I mean serious hit lists. Do you understand? Look there's no risk for you. We ain't asking you to do anything you can't handle. We just need you nearby to take the goods away on a motorbike. Just gotta take a bag. Like a courier. Keep it safe until we collect it later, that's it. That's all it is, Dee. No. I'm sorry, boys. I can't do it. Yeah, I'm all right. I'm just a bit drained, you know, bit wasted. Did you want me to come over, because I can come. No. No, I'm all right. Uh... I gotta go, all right? But... I love you. I love you, too. You all right? Yeah. Thanks. I didn't know what was going on. Marcus never said nothin'. It's all right, Dee. Just want Marcus to be OK. Fuck! Mom! Mom! Get up! Now! Move! Let's go! Fuckin'... That's my fuckin' life! You bastards! Emma was here. She told me them cunts firebombed the flat last night. That's all right. I was there. I put most of it out before the firemen even got there. Have you spoken to the boys? Yeah. Do whatever it takes to get us out of this shit. What do you want me to do? Dee, just do it. I need you to do it. We're in a bad fucking way, ain't we? Don't you understand? All right. I'll handle it. Here, guv. Hello, it's me. So, what's happening? All right, I'm in. That's sweet. It's on for tomorrow. So listen, yeah? Hi, Dee, it's Philip. I back in Berlin now. You left in a bit of a hurry the other day. I hope you're OK. Anyway, call me when you land in Berlin. See you in a bit. Keep the change, yeah? Come in. - Good afternoon, gentlemen. - Good afternoon. Keep your hands by your side! Get over here! Over here! Over here! Sit! Sit! You two: hands on the table, look natural. You, blondie, downstairs. Let's go, now! You stay exactly where you are and keep your head down. Or I'll put one straight in your nuts. Open it. Go on. Come on with the key! Next one, go, go! Move! Come on, quickly. Let's go. Good. Open the door. No alarms or we start shooting. You're coming with us. You're coming for a little walk. Behave yourself or you won't be OK. Come on. Thank you. Help! They robbed us! Hey! They robbed us! Hey! Hey! What the fuck's he doing?! Fuck sake! Watch where you're fucking going! Hey! You in the van! Move this fucking vehicle now! I'm just reversing. Move! Get outta here! You fucking idiots! Fuck, get out! Fuck! - Oh, fuck! - Fuck sake! Fuck, they're getting too close. They can have it. Fuck this! Under fire! Fuck! Fuck! Go on, mate! Go on! Suspects armed, suspects armed. Hey, pull your visor down. Pull your visor down. - Don't leave nothing in the car. - Take 'em off. Yeah. Three armed robbers were shot dead this afternoon by officers from the Met's Flying Squad as they fled the scene of a violent holdup in London's Mayfair. A spokesman for the Met has said that a fourth suspect who escaped on a motorcycle is still at large. All sea and airports have been put on alert. Talk... Fuck! Fuck! Hello! Babe, you home? - Hey! - Hey. You, uh... you all good? You all packed? Yeah, I think everything's almost in order. I went and said goodbye to some people and... Look how cute you are with your motorcycle boots and sweatpants, I love it! Are you OK? Hey, you don't look so good. Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm just, uh... I'm just worried about Marcus and my mum, that's all. Hmm, I know. Mwah! OK... I know what to do. OK. - Hi! - Hi. - Where are you traveling to? - Berlin. - His passport. - Your passports. - Here is mine. - OK. So... I'm gonna check two bags. OK, please put it on the belt. I'm gonna take this one off. This is from my last trip. We have two more bags. OK. - Only two pieces? - Are you checking your bag, too? - Yeah? - Any more bags? Yeah, just one. I'll put it right up. OK. This is for you. Oh, perfect. Thank you. - Enjoy your flight. - Danke schon. - Danke schon - OK. So we go, yes, this way. OK, we'll go through, have a little coffee, and chill out for a bit. Yeah, sweet. - You have flown before, right? - Hmm? I'm kidding, you're just so on edge this morning. Sorry, yeah, I'm spaced, sorry. OK. Got it? Can I come? OK. Oh, yeah, right here. Thank you, sorry. Is this your bag, sir? Uh, it's not a bag. It's a stamp. I use it for my artwork. - Cheers. - Cheers. Thanks. It was so funny with the customs agent. I kept thinking, what in the world is he thinking? That's the thing that Jason gave you, right? - The stamp thing? - Yeah. Oh, my God, babe, it's awesome. Can't wait to see it in action. I'll make some stencils for it as soon as we settle in. Do you know what you should do? Stamp the floor with it here. We can leave our mark and no one would ever know. No, it's not worth it. I don't want to cause trouble. Well... I'm gonna go to the bathroom. OK. The identities of the three armed robbers fatally wounded by Flying Squad officers in a gun battle yesterday have been revealed as Nicholas Miller, 24; Kwame Bonasco, 28; and Dominic Johnson, 25, of North London. Officers from the Met's Trident unit connected the men with London gangster Marcus Kenan, who is currently in hospital under police guard, recovering from gunshot wounds sustained in an underworld attempt on his life one week ago. Two robbers entered the exclusive Kraffs jewellers on New Bond Street yesterday afternoon and threatened staff with handguns. They took a female hostage with them and made away with an estimated 20 million pounds' worth of precious gems and jewellery, the largest theft of its kind the capital has ever seen. Help, they robbed us! Hey, hey! In what police have called an audacious crime, the thieves opened fire on security guards and members of the public as they made their getaway. During an extended car pursuit, the robbers were cornered by officers and opened fire. The ensuing engagement resulted in the deaths of all three suspects. However, officers did not recover the stolen jewellery, and we're now hunting a fourth suspect believed to have escaped on a motorcycle with the stolen goods. Come on, let's go to the gate. Wait a minute, those were Marcus's friends. Those were your friends. Did you know about this? Yeah, I heard. What? What do you want me to say? Come on, let's go. Take it. Just take it. Suspect passenger not sighted. All units proceed to gates. Flight number 2435h9, WizzAir to Berlin, is now ready to board. One day, when you're ready, I... I think you owe me an explanation. Yeah. I promise. Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten your seat belts and make sure your seat backs are in the upright position. I'm Dee. Good to meet you. The idea for my piece was, as you see, I did these as stencils of the first piece. In my opinion, earth is eating away at itself. How are you doing? I'm attending the opening of the contemporary section, and I'm very interested about this piece. Oh, very nice. Sorry. Thank you. Hello? All right, bruv. How's the exhibition going? Better be good. Yeah, all good. I, uh... I wish you was here. Don't worry about me, mate. I'm doing just fine. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Listen, when you're finished over there, you two should come out here, chill out for a bit. Yeah, well, uh, we'll see what happens. All right, sweet. All right, sweet. Talk soon, yeah. - It's so good. - They like it? - Yeah. - Sorry. No, no, of course. Hi, sorry about that. Yeah, I'm staying down the hall. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, you too. Thank you, bye. Looks good. Thank you, babe. Subtitles by explosiveskull
