Was it sunny that day? Was it raining? My memory is as fuzzy as the weather. What? But... But in that moment... my heart was filled with blue sky. [ The Blue Skies at Your Feet ] Good morning. You're finally up. Curry? Oh, it's recyclable trash day. Miyu, can you take it out? What? No way. Come on, help me out a little. Especially in the Kanto region, there is a possibility of strong rain with localized thunderstorms... Rain again? Hurry up and eat it. Because it won't clean itself up. Bread would've been better. It would be a waste. So eat it. Later in the evening, as cold air moves south, it will get even colder. - You're not gonna eat it? - I don't want it Hey. Oh... Miyu! Geez... Why won't it keep together on rainy days? Miyu. Your umbrella. Okay. - Have a nice day. - Yeah. Thank you. Have a nice day. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you. Have a nice day. Whoa, are you okay? I'm sorry! I'm so sorry. It's so embarrassing! Stop it! Curry in the morning, and weather forecast says it will rain all the time. I'm so unlucky. Wow, so cold! Good morning. Good morning, Sakiko. Miyu. Miyu? Huh? You okay? Huh? Why? Ah... I was wondering if you had studied for the test. Test? Fourth period, English test, remember? Do we have one today? Ah! I forgot I'm on class duty, too. Sorry, I'm going ahead. Okay. Here, take this. Later! Morning, Yuto. What's with the mask? Hey. What's going on with you two? Huh? With who? With Shuya. What's going on... Nothing. Nothing... aren't you guys dating? I don't know. What are you saying? You know, don't you? The rumors. Are you guys even talking at all? If you won't tell me, I'll just... You're so nosy. Miyu. Thanks. But I'm totally fine. I'm the worst... Go for it! Go, go! Yeah! Nice one! Thank you! Okay, I'll hand them out. What... Ah! Ah! Score less than 50, and you'll stay after school to turn in your homework. What!? Be quiet. Be quiet. Okay, put your textbooks away. Write upper case and lower case letters clearly. Shuya, you can do it! What are you daydreaming about? Sorry... Here. Oh, my God. Sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry. Thank you. Shuya, you can do it! One more! I heard growling during the test. Thanks for this. Did you get it? I got detention. What?! Today's the first. You got a date, remember? Watch the movie and tell him what I think... It's not a date, it's just a movie night. Miyu... I mean, what's the point of only going to the movies on the first when we can go anytime with a student discount? Why don't you just tell him you want to see him more? I'm not trying to say that... Okay, okay. You're not being honest, Miyu. Ah... I'm starving. But it's not that easy dating someone for two years. Yes. I don't know if I'd call it dating... Miyu, are you still bothered by the rumors? Not at all! Come on, let's eat! I'm so hungry. Lunch! - Look. - Huh? Whoa. You didn't put your lunch box the right way. But it looks delicious. Where? Well, because everything's handmade. Egg rolls, can I? It's yours. - What? Are you sure? - Yeah. Yay! Mmm... Delicious! You're exaggerating. I'll take one! - It's really good! - Right! It's really good. He's here. You should go. Yeah. I'll be right back. W-What? Miyu... Your hair's a mess. You overslept? It won't keep it together on rainy days. So? - What is it? - "What is it?"... You can go to the movie today, right? I'm free today... What the heck... It's like I'm inviting you just to kill time. See you after school. - Okay. - Okay. Do you know what today is? Movie Day? Yuto's answer was that it was my Dad's birthday. I was thinking of going to the movies. With who? Huh? The movie... who are you going with? I haven't decided yet. Let's go together. I was thinking of going too. - What? - What are you watching? - Ah... - Oh, wait. Let's say it together. So, if it's the same movie we want to see... let's watch it. What do you think? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Ready? - One, two... - One, two... "I Want to Eat Your Pancreas". Why? You two really are a perfect match. Why don't you two just go out? What? Then... let's go out? What... Congrats, man! - Way to go, Shuya! - Congrats! - Let's take a pic. - I like that! Say cheese. Is it really okay? Okay, thank you. See you tomorrow. Are you done? Are you okay? You never got detention before, right? Okay! Well, don't be a regular like this guy. Yes. What the heck.. - Hey, don't write this in katakana. - No, no, I didn't. - Be careful on your way home. Don't detour. - I won't. - See you. - Yes. Bye. Movie... you're not going? I'm going. I really... don't get you guys. I don't even know myself. - See ya. - Okay. Oh, sorry. I'll go on ahead. - Okay, bye-bye. - See you tomorrow. Take care. Miyu! Hey. Let's go. Yeah. - That's good, right? - That looks good, right? - You made a mistake. - We did? Hello? Oh, excuse me for a bit. Hello? Really? Okay. I'll be on my way. Thank you. Sorry, Miyu. Something urgent came up, so... I can't watch the movie. I'm really sorry. Urgent? Just a little... What the... Sorry. Next week, I promise! Sorry. Miyu? Okay. No, it's completely alright. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go on. Eat. Shuya, clear weather suits you. Huh? You're like the blue sky. What? Miyu. Huh? I promise. First day of every month, we'll absolutely go to the movies together. Absolutely? Yeah, even if we have a fight. Huh? No matter what happens. Okay. I promise. Okay. Let's come here again. "Starting Tomorrow, My Love For Her Will Be Rainy" will start soon... I shouldn't have made that promise. [ I want to talk to you again. I'll be waiting for you at the clock tower. ] I'm sorry. Miyu! - Listen to me! - Enough. I'm not mad. If you want to play with other girls, go ahead. It's not my business. What... I wish... you would just disappear. Miyu! Huh? A dream? Good morning. You're finally up. Why curry again? Why? Because yesterday's leftovers would go to waste. Here is the national weather forecast. It's recyclable trash day. Miyu, can you take it out? What? Help me out once in a while. Low pressure will bring rain in the evening. Especially in the Kanto region, there is a possibility of strong rain with localized thunderstorms, so please take precautions. When you go out, even if it's not raining, don't forget to bring an umbrella. Mom, is today the 1st? That's why it's recyclable trash. Later in the evening, as cold air moves south, it will get even colder. You're not gonna eat it? I'm good! Hey! Miyu? Geez... Good morning. Thank you. Have a nice day. Good morning. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you. Have a nice day. - Whoa, are you okay? - I'm sorry! I'm so sorry. Ah, it's okay. It's so embarrassing! Stop it! Wow, so cold! What is this? Déjà vu? Good morning. - Oh, Sakiko. - What's wrong? Shuya's safe, right? Huh? No! It's nothing. Right. Did you study for the test? Test... English, right? Here, I'll lend you this. Miyu? Oh, sorry, I'm going ahead. What? What's wrong with her? Beats me... The number you are calling may not be on, or out of coverage area... Miyu? Shuya. How unusual of you to come to my classroom. You're alive... What? Hey! Why won't you answer your phone? Oh, it's out of juice. Do you have a charger? Of course not. You don't... I do. Ah, Tomoka. I'll lend it to you. - Here. - Thanks. As expected of Tomoka. Well, yeah... - What's the matter? - What? I forgot my world history textbook... World history... Oh, sorry, we don't have one today. Oh. That's okay. No problem. Really? I have mine. Hey, hey, you left it again? Maybe I should stop lending it to you. I'm sorry. Can you lend it to her? Wait there. Are you okay? Yeah. Here. Thank you... very much. Yeah. Okay, Shuya, treat me to something next time! No way! - It's okay. - Shuya, you buying? No, I'll return it. - I'm good. - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. World history? We don't have one today. I know. Okay, I'll hand them out. Ah! Ah! Score less than 50, and you'll stay after school to turn in your homework. Be quiet. Be quiet. Put your textbooks away. Write upper case and lower case letters... It goes in. What are you daydreaming about? Here. It will fly. Oh, my God. Sorry, sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Is the same day repeating itself? Here. Why can't I remember this one? I heard growling during the test. How did you do? Did you get it? I got detention. What?! Today's the first. You got a date, remember? Sakiko, will you listen to me? What? I think this is the second time I've spent this day. Huh? Yesterday was November 1, and when I woke up this morning, it was November 1 again! What? What's going on? It's true! If we go to the movies today, something bad will happen. Is it a prophetic dream thing? Yeah. I heard that prophetic dreams are all subconscious. I've heard that it's a manifestation of your desires. Desire? Yes. What did you dream about? Shuya... will be punished. Miyu. You really do care! About the rumors. No! That's not it! Yes, yes, you're right. Rumor is rumor. Best not to worry about it. It's uneven. You didn't put it straight in your bag, didn't you? But it looks delicious. Want some? Sakiko chooses the egg rolls. Are you sure? - Yeah. - Then, I won't hesitate! I knew it. Delicious! I'll take one! - It's really good! - It's really good! You... know what I'm gonna say. She knows what you'll say. - She knows. - She knows. It's good, right? I knew it. It is the same. Miyu... Here it comes. What? Nothing. Your hair's a mess. I told you that it won't keep it together on rainy days. So? What is it? "What is it?"... You can go to the movie today, right? We went to the movies, and Shuya... Sorry. I can't go today. I got detention. I'll wait. I don't know when it will be. It's okay, no problem. Stubborn. I've got things to do. Things to do? Things to do at home. For how long? Anyway! I can't today. Sorry. Okay. Bye. See you tomorrow. You'll go straight home today, right? - Here! - Are you done? Are you okay? Yes. What? Oh, okay... Okay, okay, okay! - Detention regular. - Hello! - Starting tomorrow, okay? - Yes, sir. - Don't detour, just go home. - Yes, sir. - See you tomorrow. - Yes. Movie... you're not going? If he doesn't go to the movies, he'll be fine. Ah! Hey... Come on. - Come on, come on. Shh... - Ouch! What are you doing? I really don't get you guys. I don't even know myself. [ I'm watching this today. If you change your mind, just come. ] This is the movie I wanted to see. [ Starting Tomorrow, My Love For Her Will Be Rainy ] Sorry! I'm going ahead. What? Sorry! See you tomorrow! Hey, Miyu! Wow, I want to watch this next month. - Which one? - This one, this one. A sci-fi, "Concluder". Oh... What about you? Anything you want to watch? Shuya, you idiot! Oh, come on! Found him. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday dear Tomoka ♪ Happy birthday to you - Wow! - Let's take out the sparklers. Stop, stop! It's dangerous. I'm sorry. Can I make a call? Miyu? Hello. What are you doing here? Oh, um... I thought you can't go to the movies today. Oh, um... I was just returning this. Thank you very much. Good. What? Let me be with him today. Bye. Hey! Today... don't let Shuya go to the movies. Please. I intend to. Hold this, hold this, both of you hold this. I'm okay with this. I saved him... Thank goodness... Hello? Here, your lunch box. Thanks. Oh? Shuya's not with you? Yeah. Did something happen? What about the movie? Today's the first, right? There it is, Yuto's meddling. What the hell is he doing? Today I told him I can't go. Why? A lot of things happened. Are you okay? I'm okay. Are you? Your nosiness is hard-core, isn't it I'm not being nosy. I don't like it when you cry. - Thanks for the surprise. - Not at all. It's great that everyone was there. I'm glad. Everyone had a great time, didn't they? Shuya... Don't go. I... I like you. Sorry, I have to go! Shuya! Shuya! Hey! Hey, you there! Are you okay? Are you okay? Can you answer me? Shuya... Why? I'm back. It's not a dream. It's definitely repeating itself. Ah, Shuya! The number you are calling may not be on or out of coverage... Miyu? Good morning. Aren't you late for today? I was waiting for you, Shuya. What? I can't call your phone. It must be low battery. Yes. - What's wrong? - What? Ah... nothing. You don't have a fever. You okay? You're spacing out. That startled me... Huh? I thought I hadn't seen it in a while. Huh? Your smile. What are you talking about? Well, because... recently you're kind of moody and not feeling well. Because of... the rain! I prefer you that way. I prefer you smiling. Is this a dream? A desire? No. You can go today, right? To the movies. Yeah. Okay. I want to save Shuya. Shuya. Yeah? Can we leave early today? Okay. I'll go buy some. - Whoa! - Whoops. What the heck... You're late. I like you. Ah, yeah... Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. If you forget a period, you lose a point. Here. You're motivated, aren't you? I am! Did you get it? Perfect! Here, an egg roll! Here. Thank you. - It's really good! - It's really good! Miyu? Thanks for the textbook the other day. What? Huh? Oh... it's nothing. Shuya was here a while ago... Movie? Huh? Shuya told me that the first of every month is movie day. Yes. That's nice. But isn't it lonely if that's all there is? If I were you, I'd want to see him more. Take better care of him. - Even I... - Ow, ow, ow! Ah, Shuya. Oh, Miyu! Wait here a bit. Okay. See ya... Hey, Shuya. I have a favor to ask. Huh? Turn off your phone. What? Now? Isn't it better when the movie starts? I need you to turn it off now. What's the matter? Please. Just for today, listen to me. Okay. Is that okay? - Thank you. - Okay. It's gonna be okay. I can save him for sure today. "Starting Tomorrow, My Love For Her Will Be Rainy" will be starting soon. Let's go. Shuya. Tomoka? Why is she here? I finally found you. I can't get a hold of you at all. Oh, sorry. Can we talk for a bit? Okay. Wait here. - Okay. - Okay, I'll go ahead. Miyu, I'm sorry. Can we do the movie next week? Did something happen? It's an emergency... I'm really sorry. You promised you'd listen to me today, didn't you? I'm sorry. Don't go. - Miyu. - Please! Sorry. If you insist on going... then let's break up. What? You're choosing her, aren't you? - What are you saying? - I'm serious. My last request. After today, you and I can break up. So, just for today... Please. Miyu. Are you really thinking that? What? You can decide if it's the last time or breaking up. If you have something to say, say it! Shuya, don't just hide and sneak around, speak up! - What about you, Miyu? You've never once told me how you really feel. I'm going. Huh? Hello? Hello? It's me. You forgot your lunch box, didn't you? Oh, yeah... I forgot. Oh, and I don't mean to be nosy, but I asked Shuya about the rumors with Tomoka. He said they were just part-timers. What? That guy must be working part-time too. So... don't worry about it anymore. Bye. [ I want to talk to you again. I'll be waiting for you at the clock tower. ] Shuya! Shuya! Shuya! Shuya! Shuya! Shuya! Somebody! Help! Somebody! Please! Turn it back! I beg of you! One more time... Please! Okay. Taurus, today brings you good luck. Positive attitude toward everything will bring good results. Good morning. Good morning. Do you do that every day? You think the creases on your skirt would straighten on their own? Thanks. Wait a minute. I'll get you breakfast. I'll pack your lunch first. I didn't notice it. I thought I was repeating the same day over and over. Here. Have a nice day. - I'm off. - Okay. - Bye. - Yeah, have a nice day. But... every day that I thought was the same was that every day was different. Thank you. Have a nice day. If I can change it, I'm sure it will change. Good morning. Thank you. Good morning. I'm off. Have a nice day. Hey, let's go! Look! Wow, amazing! Sakiko! - Good morning. - Good morning. You waited for me? Yeah. I just want to talk to you. I see. So they were part-timers. Yeah. I was afraid to confirm the truth with Shuya. Miyu... I always wondered what Shuya liked about me. Do you not trust Shuya? It's not that. I'm just not sure of myself. Miyu... We started going out on a whim, didn't we? It's not on a whim. What? If you say it was on a whim, I feel sorry for Shuya. What do you mean? I was told this would be an absolute secret. Ah, Sakiko. Tell me a movie you think Miyu would like. - A movie Miyu might like? - Shh! Tell me. That confession during the first year... I was thinking of going too. Shuya asked us to do it, and we all set it up. What? Shuya had been in love with you for a long time. Ah... I feel so much better. I finally said it. Thank you. Shuya really loves you, Miyu. Yes. What about you, Miyu? I'll... talk to Shuya properly. Ah! Sakiko, aren't you on school duty today? I've got the test today. So go! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Yuto! What the heck... That scared me... Don't turn around so suddenly. Good morning. What's up? You're looking well... Yeah. I... am okay now. - Are you? - Yeah. Thank you for your concern. I'm not really concerned, though. Oh, you are nosy. Hey. But... thanks for your meddling. Hey. Good luck. Okay. Miyu? Is Shuya in here? Movie day, right? Shuya told me that the first of every month is movie day. Yes. That's nice. But isn't it lonely if that's all there is? If I were you, I'd want to see him more. Take better care of him. I do take care of him. I care about him a lot. Miyu? Ah, Shuya. I have a favor to ask. Huh? Am I heavy? More than before. That's harsh. Then why are we riding a bike? Yuto said we could ride it. He's so nosy. So what's the matter? What? Your hair! Ah... weird, isn't it? It looks so good on you! Hey! You think they know I skipped class? Are you freaking out maybe? No, I'm not. Shut up. I wanted to come here one more time. Shuya. Is it true you're working part-time? How did you know that... Was it Tomoka? I heard you two were working together. It's just a coincidence. A rental store at the next station Because we finish late, the manager asks me to walk her to the station, so we sometimes go home together. Why didn't you tell me? About your part-time job. It's... For our anniversary. What? Because I forgot last year... our first year anniversary since we started dating. That you had prepared a present for me... and Sakiko told me about it later. I regretted it so much. So, I've been working part-time secretly... I promise. I'll do it right on our 2nd anniversary. You are an idiot. Idiot... Why don't you tell me? Why... To surprise you? Why are you crying? I'm not crying. Miyu. I'm not crying. I... love it when you smile. Do you remember the first day we met? I do. It was love at first sight. You're lying. Your smile made me smile too. So... I want you to keep smiling. Yeah. - Happy birthday! - You're 18! You're 18, first shot, where do you want to go? - We should go somewhere together. - Camping. Not at an amusement park? Then, let's have Tomoka, our star decide. You're right. Where do you want to go? Sorry. Can I make a quick call? Ah... okay, okay. Then we'll decide on our own. We'll decide on our own. Don't be mad. Don't be mad. Sorry. Miyu. I have a part-time job today... Shuya, do you know? We can go to the movies not just on the 1st, but we can watch it anytime. That's why... I want to see you more. Okay. Today is all good. Let's go again. Yeah, thanks. See you tomorrow. I want you to smile, too. Tomoka. Thanks for calling me. The part-time job? Are you not going? Shuya, I need to talk to you. Huh? I'm sorry. I lied. I really wanna be with you today. You lied about having a shift? I like you, Shuya. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Tomoka. Happy birthday. [ No part-time. I'll be waiting for you at the clock tower. I want to see you. ] No matter how many times it is repeated, I may not be able to change his fate. But still... I want to save Shuya. Shuya! Miyu... Miyu! Miyu! Somebody! Miyu... Are you okay? Somebody, somebody call an ambulance! Somebody! Miyu! Are you okay... Miyu! Thank goodness... Miyu... Miyu... Miyu! Miyu? Ah, Miyu... I'm glad you're safe. Mom. Thank goodness... Shuya... What about Shuya? Shuya saved you. What do you mean? He protected you when you almost got run over... Miyu. - Listen to me! - Enough. I'm not mad. If you want to play with other girls, go ahead. It's not my business. Miyu! Shuya... Wake up. No, Shuya! Wake up! Please! Wake up! Miyu... Shuya... Miyu... Shuya. Miyu. [ To Miyu ] Shuya was holding on to it. To Miyu. I can't speak honestly when I'm face to face with you. So I'm writing you a letter. I'm sorry we haven't spoken more often lately. Delicious! You're exaggerating. I'll take one! It's really good! I haven't seen your smiling face for a while. He's here. - Okay, I'll record it. - Okay, nice. Ready! Yay! I made a mistake. I'll go on ahead. Sorry, sorry. Miyu! Soon it will be our two-year anniversary. I'm sorry about last year. This anniversary, I want to make you smile. I want to spend time with you this year. I wanna be with you forever and ever. Shuya. I thought it would never end. I thought the same day would go on forever. Miyu! But... every day was a completely different day. Every day ends and a new day begins again. And one day, the end will come. But I'm not afraid. I live every day as if it were my last. Even if it's sad or painful, I feel it as much as I can and create a different everyday. When I'm sad, I look at the sky, when I'm in pain, I look at my feet, and pick up a smile. The rain will clear up someday, and the blue sky will spread out in the sky and under my feet, as long as I keep smiling. Miyu! I missed you so much. I love you. I love you too.
