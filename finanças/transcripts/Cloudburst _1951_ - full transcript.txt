[roars] ## ## [church bell rings] [various conversations] So, this is the coding department. Um-hm. Very cozy. Yes. [laughs] I'm trying very hard to look as if I understand what you're doing. So are we. Tell me, what is the first thing you do to ring sense from a code? Kill anyone who talks unless it's absolutely necessary. Oh, and what then? Then we proceed on the information you've so kindly given us. Oh, you do? Um-hm. But anything I told you is pure guesswork. Any purity from the foreign office is always welcomed. Oh, thank you very much. But I still can't see how I've helped. Well, you've told us this message was transmitted five years ago by a Japanese colonel named M.M. Soo. Yes. Well, if M.M. Soo signed his name to the message, then we've got seven letters to look for. But what if he hasn't put his signature there? Then we're very unlikely to find it. I see. You know, I think I'm getting the hang of all this. I've guessed that this message refers to the execution of allied business. So you fellows are looking for words like "execution," "allied," "business." That's right. Then what is dutiful? Oh, kiss the emperor's boots. I beg your pardon. That used to be a very popular Japanese way of ending a message. Oh, I see, of course. Let's wait in here, shall we? Certainly. Do you speak Japanese? Yes, a little. Any other languages? A little French, a little Spanish a little Italian. Came over here as a child. A little English. Oh. If this message contains what I think it does, we'll be able to bring the minister to trial at once. Now how much longer do you think it will take to decode the message? With luck, a few minutes. Good. Without luck... a year. A year? ## [various conversations] [knocking on door] Come in. [door opens] We've got it, sir. Good man. Are you really serious? Yes, sir. So are we. Here are, Cardew. Thank you very much. [sighs] We can hang him on this evidence. We can hang him. Well that's one way of getting some rest. Johnson, see that Mr. Cardew is escorted as far as the Foreign Office. Otherwise he might casually leave this message in a taxi. Oh, I say... Goodbye, Cardew. [sighs]Come back again. We'll help you with your income tax. Oh, thank you very much. Now I would just... This way, sir. Oh, yes. [coughs] [sighs] [car horn honks] ## Give us a lift, lady. John. ## Darling. Well... You filled in nine words. You must have been here for hours. I'd like to see you fill in more. You would? ## You and your photographic brain. What'd the doctor say this morning? That I've got no need to worry until August. And that you work too hard. Hurry up, August. You don't have to wait till then to celebrate a birthday. There's quite an important one on Saturday. Really? Whose? John, don't you remember? No. No. Although I did make a list of something rather unpleasant I've got to do. Oh, yes. What's this? Oh, it's nothing important. Just a list of presents I'm thinking of buying you. Written in code? What did you bought me? Work it out. How could anyone? Darling, please. ## Please, darling, please. I said I was taking you straight home. But this is home, darling. This is home. Well we're only going to stop a second. All right. Unless you decode that piece of paper for me. Oh, well, I meant two more days. [laughs] What are they doing now? Uh, the boys are doing their homework. The masters are asleep in the common room. What window's that? That's the headmaster's. He's writing reports. He has to work late to try to remember about whom he's writing them. Darling, I love this school. But what if we have a girl first? Well that's all taken care of. There's the girl's school. Of course I've never been inside. Of course. But its products look wonderful. What if our children aren't bright enough to pass their entrance exam? Well then, I shall love them all the more and help them to cheat. ## ## In between mathematics lessons I used to daydream. Sometimes about more mathematics, sometimes about the girls' school. Sometimes about impossible things. Like helping to bring peace to the world. Darling, stop it. I didn't know of the Resistance Movement then. I might have dreamed of that instead. But then I might've been used to the idea of sabotage, midnight burials, and having my life saved at the cost of... John! I'm sorry, darling. I'm sorry. Can't you forget what they did to me? I've forgotten, John, the pain's over. And if it weren't, if I had it ahead of me, I'd go through it again, for you or anyone. It's part of a job. Darling, listen. Listen. [knocking sounds] Do you remember that? Yes. What is it? A code we used to use. What's it saying? Everything's all right. Then answer it, darling. Answer it. [knocking] That's it. Because everything is all right. Only you're too tired to see it. You're wearing yourself out, John. Got to stop. It's got to stop. Darling, will you promise to do as I ask? All right, then. I want you take a month's complete rest. [knocking]Uh-uh... Not a fortnight, a month. And you're to start at once. [knocking] No arguments. I wasn't going to argue, Mum. No? I was just to say that... Yes? When my son finds his Carol, if ever she saves his life, I hope he'll know how to say thank you better than his father did. Be quiet, you're annoying me. What kind of caps do they wear? Blue. Oh. And he better have blue eyes, not like his father. Brown eyes with blue rings around them. So we want to fight, do we? Yes, please. But in the car, it's warmer. You're a lucky building. In ten years time, you'll have a new customer. With blue eyes. Who will rewrite the letter language and daydream. ## I brought you back one very tired brother-in-law. Hello, Miss. Hello, John. How's the scamp? Oh, Mummy's wonderful, thanks. She sends you her love. Oh, what a family. Always wonderful. Ah. Always sending love. [sighs] Always full of tact. Always... Darling? Like a drink? [sighs] John? He's out. Shall I serve now? No Kate, we'll let him sleep. But the chicken's been sleeping for two hours. Well, we'll have it cold tomorrow. At this rate, it won't be cold till next year. Handsome, isn't he? Not bad for a first husband. He's worn out of course. But he's promised he'll take a rest. Oh, good. [chimes] Darling, better go. Mummy will be anxious. Everything's all right, darling.[moans] Everything's all right. Everything's all right. [thunder] I'll hire a carriage outside the door. ??? I'll drive you to the station. Won't take a minute. ## Kate? I'm driving Miss Peggy to the station. If Mr. Graham wakes, tell him I'll only be a few minutes. Yes, ma'am. [thunder] Carol! Carol? Carol? Kate? Kate, where's Mrs. Graham? She said to tell you she'd only be a few minutes. She's taken Miss Peggy to the station. [thunder] I think I'll go and meet her. Air will clear my head. I'll... I'll be ready for your chicken when I get back. That'll clear a lot more than your head, sir. Wrap yourself up. Thank you. ## ## Give us a lift, lady? John. I thought I'd come and meet you. I can't leave you alone for a minute. Get in the car before it starts raining. You see that field? I'm going to buy it. What are you going to do? Graze there? Make the boy a football pitch. Stop trying to weed around me. You shouldn't have come out. You know with a little hard work, we could build a tennis court too. Darling, I'm hoping to give you a family, not a sports club. Can we afford it? With children like ours, we can't afford not to afford it. Come and have a look. [bell rings] Good evening, Mr. Graham. Good evening, ma'am. Good evening, Constable. You're late tonight. There's an alarm out. Who for? Man and a woman, killed a night watchman, they had. Broke his neck. Where? Windsor, ten miles from here. Killed his dog, too. Nice little thing. Well, if we see them... You won't see them, Mr. Graham. They're heading for London. But we'll get them. Goodnight, sir. Goodnight. We'll get them. If I were that night watchman's widow, I'd get them first. Would you? I'd try. I'd hang them with as little pity as we hanged Ed Zimmerman. I couldn't help it, John. My hatred would overwhelm me like a... cloudburst. Stay angry, my darling. It gives you a dimple. Or is it dirt? You getting cold? No, darling, nothing. Let's have a quick look at our stadium and go. All right. ## [car horn honking] Careful, darling. Mind the car. Darling! Stop! Stop! [tires skidding] Carol! ??? Help me lift the car, help me. Stay out of it! It'll be all right, Carol. It'll be all right. [gears grinding] What are you doing? What are you doing? [struggling noises] She's dead. So what? [man] Stay out of it! Stay out of it! You're wasting time, Mickey. Stay out of it! Hey! [engine races] Carol? E, P... E, P, L... [mumbling] ## I told her... as long as I lived, no one would hurt a hair of her head... ever again. That's what I told her. ## Mr. Graham? Leave him alone. ## [sighs] There's something I've got to say. So I'll get it over quickly. We all want to burst. But somehow we haven't because we're trying to help each other. I need your help more than you need mine. Darling, if there's anything we can do. There is. I want you to stay with me. Of course we will. I don't mean for a little while. I don't even mean till the time we can speak of her without... without choking. I mean always. John. I'm going on living in this house. I'm going to buy that field. Because what would be good for my children, would be good for other people's. But you're all that's left to me of Carol. Don't let us drift. Of course not, darling. This is your home if you want it. Everything that's in it is yours, if you want it. I'm not your son-in-law, I'm your son if you want it. [crying] If... If... Ah, there. I wasn't going to break down. I wasn't going to. Don't keep it in. Why didn't he stop, John? Why didn't he? Steady. You'd stop for a dog. Well, they won't get away with it, I promise you that. They won't get away with it. They? You told the coroner there was only one man in the car. Well, I saw there was. Well, then why did you say "they?" Yes, John, why did you? I meant the fates. The fates that have done this to us. That's all I meant. I see. Now we, we must be practical. You must eat something and have a good long sleep, agreed? Agreed. What about that holiday? I've applied for a month's leave, will that do? For a start. [Peggy] John? Yes, Pegs. How are you going to spend it? How? As Carol would want me to. ## [rolling sound] [Carol] And he better have blue eyes, not like his father, brown eyes with blue rings around them. [car horn honking] ## [John] I told her... as long as I lived, no one would hurt a hair of her head, ever again. That's what I told her. [Carol] If I were that night watchman's widow, I'd get them first. If I were that night watchman's widow, I'd get them first. If I were that night watchman's widow, I'd get them first. Jackie. Who's that? Don't you remember me? Good Lord, it's old man sabotage himself. Hello, Jackie. It's good to see you. Good to see you. John, this is a treat. Just wait till the wife sees you. She can't stand you, of course. Why not? You saved my life, she never forgive you. What are you doing in these parts? I want some help. From me? Yes. Well that's swell, boy, come and meet the wife. Oh, another time, I'd love to. But... Confidentially? Yes, Jackie. I've got a job to do. I can't ask the police for help because it involves a friend of mine. So I've come to you. What is it? I want you to help me trace a dark gray Buick. Number EPL 782. EPL 782. Where was it last seen? Near Windsor. Windsor? That's where a night watchman was murdered. Yes, I believe it was. No connection, I suppose. [snickers] None whatever. This is a personal matter. A kind of debt to be collected, that's all. I see. It won't be easy. Neither was finding Zimmerman. It'll be done. When the time comes, I may need some number plates. That can't be traced. Haven't lost the knack have you? It'll be the last thing I lose. Thanks, Jackie. Quite like old times, isn't it? No, Jackie, it's lonelier. So long. So long, sir. [various conversations] Hello, son. Hello. [whistling sound] Colonel Graham. Go on, son. Hello, Chuck. Oh, I'm glad to see you, sir. Can we go somewhere private? Well yes, sir, of course. In here. Go on in, sir. There's no exposure from the door. [laughs] Are you glad to be back here? Yes, sir. I've been fond of kids all my life. I have to appear tough, of course. When one of our wits me a wallop, I could kiss him. Are they as hard to teach as we used to be? No, sir, they come knowing the dirty tricks. You chaps already shown them. You've come to get yourself in shape again? In a way. All right, sir. You'll do. I need your help, Chuck. Don't feel like it, sir. Do you still keep up your contacts in the boxing world? Yes, sir. Good. I'm searching for a man about whom I know absolutely nothing. Except he has a boxer's hands, a boxer's nose, and a boxer's ear. Sounds like a wrestler. His name is Mick. Mick who, sir? I don't know. Oh. I want to find him, Chuck for a personal reason. I see, sir. Means a great deal to me. Can you tell me more about him? Height about 5-10, medium build. 5-10, medium. Probably boxed as a welter. Age about 30. May go around with a woman called Lorna. Oh, he has a small scar on the knuckles of his right hand. Age 30, goes around with a dame called Lorna, who bit him. May have a slight Cockney accent but don't bank on that. No, sir. And that's all. Not a lot, is it? Chuck. All we were given when we were told to find Hewley, was that he had a mole on his forehead and liked cream cheese. True enough, sir. Well, I'll see what I can do. Oh, in the meantime perhaps you'd like to look through some of these boxing albums in case you spot a picture of him. Yes, Chuck, yes. There you are, sir, there's plenty groundworkof roundwork there. I welcome it. One more thing. Yes, sir. You remember Operation Crayfish? Do I. That was it. I got you. Nobody will know you're looking for Mick, I can promise you. Thanks. And if he has a friend that wants looking after, let me know. He has, Chuck, he has. ## ## Temple Bar 1340. Hello, Chuck. About that matter we've been discussing. His name is Fraser, Mickey Fraser. That's right, he used to box under the name of Kid Python. You know him? Or do you know anyone who's likely to know him? Good man. I'll be waiting by the phone. Thanks, boy, bye. [gun loads and clicks] Hello? Hello, Colonel Graham? Chuck here. I'm sorry to have kept you so long. That gentleman that you were interested in. He gave up the ring two years ago, no trace of him since. His brother had a farm, and sometimes that Mickey Fraser trained there. Yes, sir, I've got the address. Right, Chuck, I've got it. Thanks, boy. If ever there's anything I can do... All right. So long, Sergeant. ## [hissing] [knocking on door] Hello, Jackie. Hello, John. Just finishing. You've not lost your touch, Jackie. They'll pass in a dark night with a dumb policeman. They'll pass on any night with any policeman.[laughs] When are you going to start using them? Soon. Anything else you want? No. Can I come with you? I'll be awfully quiet. Thanks for everything. I wish I knew what you were up to. I'd like to tell you, Jackie, but I've given my word. I see. You are telling me the truth. It isn't worse than you're making it up. Ah, no. I've probably made it sound a lot more important than it really is. Well if it isn't important, why are you taking all this trouble? I told you before, Jackie. It's for a friend. Uh-huh. I've got to hurry. John, take care. Yes, Jackie. I'll take care. [tools clank] ## [dog barking] ## ## [door opens] [floor creaks] [creaking continues] [large thud] [chain groans] [groaning continues] Here I am, Mickey. Get up, Mickey. Ow! Leave it there. [groans] I don't want to have to use this yet. Who are you? Come and see. Don't you recognize me? No. You remember now? [loud slap]Ooh! Oh! [groans] What's your name? Let me go. What's your name? Let go of me. Let go. What's the big idea? The more you move the more you'll cut yourself. What do you want? Ask you a couple of questions. [gasps] My wrists. And keep still. Mick, you remember that woman you ran over? Have ever wondered what kind of person she was? That wasn't my fault. You killed three people that night. You killed my wife, you killed my child and you killed me. It wasn't my fault, it was Lorna. She claimed to murder her. Where is she? I don't know. Where is she, Mick? I said I don't know, we split up. I won't tell you much about my wife, but I'd like you to know this. The Gestapo wanted to find out where I was hiding. Just as I want to find out where Lorna is. So for three days and three nights they tried everything they knew to make her talk. And in the end, they laid bare a nerve on her leg, tied a piece of wire around it, and pulled it tight. She still wouldn't talk. I want to see if you have her courage. You're out of your mind. Let me go. Let me go! I'm afraid I haven't their equipment.[gasps] And I don't know as much about knots as they did. So I've had to improvise. Are you ready, Mick? No. No. Well, Mick? [groans] Ow! Don't leave it too late, will you, Mick? She's in Cornwall. [gasps]Repeat that. She's in Cornwall. Near St. Ives. A bungalow. When did she leave for St. Ives? Night that it happened. How did she get there? By train. Undo these things. What station did she leave from? Amerton. Five minutes from here. The night of my wife's death the last train from Amerton was 10:57. She didn't die till 10:50. Lorna couldn't possibly have made it. Yes, I will explain. [sighs]Mick. Our instructors used to hammer home one thing. When you're being tortured, remember the first lie is the most important. You may never get a chance to tell another. No. [groans] Oh! I'll talk. [whispering] I'll talk. [lighter clicks] Here. Where is she? 6 Chalmers Road. It's a lodging house in Acton. This had better be the truth. It's the truth. She's on the first floor. Room number three. Let me out of here. Hold still. [cuts rope] [groans] Come on. Huh? [chain groans] Come on. What, where're you taking me? Not far. What are you going to do? I'm going to give you a driving lesson. What, where are we going? You, you'll never get away with this. They'll hang you. They'll hang you. As long as I finish what I've got in mind I don't care what they do to me. You've made me a perfect murderer, Mick. You've taken away everything I want to live for. All right, I think we're there. [pulls up parking brake] Get out. I'm giving you a chance to run for it. Well, well listen. I'm gonna count ten, Mick. That ought to be familiar to you.Listen. I'll do as you ask. I'll do anything. Get out. ## Start running. ## [engine accelerates] ## [engine accelerates faster] What I don't understand is why should a piece of paper in code be on the floor of a boxer's gym. It probably is comments on the board of control. Get me Thompson, Special Branch, ask him if he can spare a second. Tell him The Superintendent's here. Is The Superintendent here, sir? Don't I have to superintend everything that goes on? Yes, sir. Then stop quibbling. [phone buzzes] Davis here. [door opens] No luck, I'm afraid. You haven't decoded one word? I'm afraid not. I'll be blunt, Davis. Ciphering is only a sideline with my department. Are you sure your department isn't a sideline with your department? There's no need to be unpleasant about it. This type of thing calls for a specialist. A professional cryptographer. Just because you can't break code, there's no need to talk in it. What's a cryptographer? A cryptanalyst. What's a cryptanalyst? A person who specializes in the breaking of codes. Is that clear enough? Yes, thanks. Now all you've got to do is tell me one. Well, the greatest of all is at the Foreign Office now, John Graham. John Graham? Can that be the Canadian who worked in The Resistance? Yes, do you know him? I was at The Palace the first time he was decorated. Really? What were you doing inside The Palace? Cleaning the windows. John Graham, eh? I've always wanted to meet him. Inspector who? Are you sure he wants to see me? All right. Ask him to come up, please. [hangs up phone] [knocking on door] Come in. Inspector Davis, sir. Mr. Graham. How do you do, Inspector? How do you do, sir? It's good of you to see me. Won't you sit down? Thank you, sir. Cigarette? No thank you, sir. You know it's so odd that we should meet like this? Several of my lads at The Yard worked under you in The Resistance. I promised them if ever I ran into you, I'd buy you a drink. Which ones were they? Carter, Stopford and Martin. Carter, Stopford and Martin. I'm gonna buy you a drink. What'll it be? Well, sir, it's a bit early for me. Just a small whiskey. Soda? Just a splash, please. Top secret. Here you are. Thank you. To Carter, Stopford and Martin. And code, sir. Tell me, are they all back at The Yard? Oh yes, sir. And you made great policeman of them. Carter's now the finest shadow we have on the force. Stopford the finest interrogator. And Martin is the most accomplished liar I've met since myself on point duty. Good boys. Well sir, I'll come to the point. Does the Fraser Python Murder convey anything to you? Yes, I believe it does. Surely that's what the newspapers call that murder by some motorist who's run amuck. That's right, sir. He ran over a man called Mickey Fraser who used to be a boxer. And reversed his car and ran over him again. So far our biggest chance of catching him seems to lie on this. Who's is it? I suspect it's the Python Murderer. [smirks] Gives me an odd feeling to handle it. I suppose you're used to all that by now. Yes, just about. Now this is interesting. Five zeds and two lines. Three Qs, an X as well. This is substitution cipher. If I left you alone for five minutes, could you decode it? Yes, if you left your second sight with me. Seriously, sir, I need your help. I've approached you direct because it takes so long for official channels. Official channels don't exist. There are only official oceans or official sewers. Hear, hear. So will you help me out? Will you have a shot at it? Hmm, would be a most unusual experience. All right, Inspector, I'll do what I can. Thank you, sir. But are you quite certain this is the Python Murder's? I hate to be laying bare the private life of a Boy Scout. That's the Python Murder's all right, sir. I know that as surely as you know it's a substitution cipher. I see. Well. He must be a very careless chap to leave it lying about like this. Enjoying the struggle with phrasery, probably lost his head for a moment. It's lucky for us he wasn't trained by you. Oh, hold on. We used to make mistakes too, you know. But we could always blame the enemy. I hope it won't take you too long. So much may depend on that piece of paper. What for instance? The Python Murderer's identity, sir. At the moment we know as little about him as you do. Well that doesn't give us much option, does it? We must give this top priority. Thanks. The last man we hanged left a handkerchief at the scene of the crime, bless him. The one before that left a cigarette stub. This one's been more original. You mean he doesn't smoke and he hasn't a cold. He's going to catch a cold all right, sir. You just tell us who coded that message. We'll do the rest. What can you give me some idea of the contents of the message? No, I'm afraid not, sir. The most I can do is give you a list of Mickey Fraser's friends. Well, that's better than nothing. Yes sir, if you can read the writing. Adams, John. Dartmore. Aprey, Tom, Pentonville Briggs, Peter, Brixton. Dawson, Lorna, address unknown. Johnson, Paul, Pimeco. That's quite a selection. These may be invaluable to me. I hope so, sir. Well, I'll leave you to it. [various conversations] ## [conversations continue] Well? Whoever thought this out knows his stuff, sir. Nothing coming yet? Nothing at all, sir. We've tried out most of your suggestions. Then I'll have to make some more. It must be broken. ## Have you tried columns five and eight? No, sir. Well, do, they look promising. Try linking the E and R. Very good, sir. That's not bad. Keep on with it. With that third column. Right, sir. ## Yes, Constable. Good man. Good man. No, I'm coming myself. We're on to it, Ritchie. We got her address. Lorna Dawson, sir? Yes, she's at Acton. And we'll be waiting for her. ## [knocking on door] ## [cracking sound] ## [glass breaking] [engine accelerating] And then he landed a lucky blow on the chin and got clean away through the window. Still, it's no good crying over spilled inspectors. No, sir. We've got Lorna Dawson, that's something to be going on with. Yes, sir. You stand up, Ritchie. Me, sir? Yes, you. Now then. If I led with my left, where would it land on your anatomy? It depends on how straight you aim, sir. Very straight. It would land about... there. What have you in mind, sir? The Python Murderer, Ritchie. He hid his face, but he couldn't hide his height. He's just over six feet tall, broader than you are, but not as fat. Quick on the move and a trained fighter. You should have seen how quickly he doused his torch and used it as a weapon. That's one of the tricks Stopford showed me. Heights don't scare him either. He scaled out of that window like a... Where did Stopford learn those tricks? Ritchie, tell me if I'm not making sense, but don't dare to interrupt me. Tonight the Python Murderer made a big mistake. He showed me his skill. The man enters like a professional burglar. Fights like a professional boxer. And tracks down Lorna Dawson even before I did. He also knows how to use codes. Where'd he learn all this technique? Where did Carter, Stopford and Martin learn it? You mean that he... I mean the Python Murderer has the same kind of training as they have. Commando, the Resistance Movement, his every reaction screams it. It's lighting up, Ritchie, it's lighting up. Let's get into his mind. Why should he want to kill Mickey and Lorna? Revenge, but what wrong have they done him? And where does the car fit in? Let's run really wild. Mickey came out of prison eight months ago. Suppose he and Lorna gained up to do a job as we suspect they did. They'd be almost certainly use a car. They're both disqualified from driving for life so they might get someone to do it for them. Suppose that someone were the Python Murderer? Suppose they had a quarrel of some kind? They refuse to split with him. Mickey and Lorna go into hiding. He finds Mickey, kills him. But why didn't he take the money we found in Mickey's dressing table? And why go to the trouble of killing him with a car? No, we've, we've gone wrong somewhere. [groans] [knocking on door] Come in. Hello, Miss. Hello, John. Sorry to be so late. I bumped into some friends. I tried to phone you. But I couldn't. How's mother? Oh, fine, she's in bed. Has the doctor called? Yes, he's quite satisfied with her. Good. Can I get you some supper? No, no thanks, Pegs. I had some sandwiches at the office. Really? On your word of honor? Miss Reece, do you think I'm a liar? A marvelous one. What? Carol once told me that you were strapped to a liar detector for five hours. Every word, every gesture was recorded on a chart. You couldn't even hiccup without it registering. And yet, you fooled it. So what John survived. You remember everything Carol said, don't you? Oh, John, I'm, I'm sorry. For remembering Carol? I think I'll see if Mother's asleep. Oh, she is, I've given her a sedative. Then she hasn't been well. Well, I try not to let her see the papers, but she got hold of them somehow, at about the Python Murder. It reminded her of Carol. Python Murder. There's no such thing. But John... It was nothing but an accident. A terrible tragic accident. The press have no right to play on the imagination of innocent people, no right at all. And you for one should have sense enough to know better. I'm sorry, Pegs. But you're always so level-headed, I didn't expect you to be taken in. Perhaps I'm not. I'm sure you're not. Am I forgiven? Yes. Thanks. John? Hmm? What's the matter with your arm? Nothing. But you're holding it so stiffly. I'm getting ready to slap you if you don't get some rest. Listen, Grandpa. I can take care of myself. Oh you can, can you? Well you better start doing it now. ## That poor lie detector. Good night. ## John. Let's keep to the idea that Mickey and Lorna ganged up to a job. Supposing something unforeseen happened, with them at the wheel, anything could. The Python Murderer in the car with them. And what went wrong? A collision? An accident? Did they knock him down and leave him for dead? I'm going to make a start somewhere. Ritchie, I'm going to waste some time, perhaps a lot of time. I want to examine every accident report for the past eight months. Yes, sir. If that doesn't help, we'll go back further, we'll keep going back until we find something that leads us to a man six feet tall, not as fat as you are, who wants revenge, and has been taught how to get it. Which volume do you fancy? I suppose I haven't the option, sir. A to K, it's shorter. It's yours. Thank you, sir. Give me the indexes. Here, sir. Now. Let's see if any of these names convey anything. Nothing much in A. Pick up Barrs. See if he's the one I arrested for arson, he was six feet too and an ex commando. No, sir. This one was a senior advisor to The Treasury, and was injured in The Pelves. I'm sure he won't miss it. Look up Crowley. Mickey had a friend called Crowley. Then Dans. You might look up Dobson. Hardly any ease injured a tall. Look up Forbes, see if that's Taggy. He and Mickey loathe each other. Not much I recognize in G. Gould, Grant, Graham, Grey. Say Graham, sir? Yes, I did. File 471. It's Graham, Carol, wife of Mr. John Graham. Killed by a car which didn't stop. Give me that. [Kate] Yes. [Davis] Good morning. Is Mr. Graham at home? He's just dressing, sir. Oh, do you mind if I wait? Who are you? Inspector Davis, Scotland Yard. Inspector Davis. Oh, do come in. Always glad to meet a colleague, sir. Colleague? Yes, sir, I used to be in the policettes. Policettes? You know, sir. Cigar, cigarettes, usher, usherette, police, policettes. And another thing they taught me was how to throw a man over my shoulder. As if I could afford to. I mean they wouldn't come back again then, would they?[door closing] Good morning, Inspector. Hello, Mr. Graham. Kate, bring the Inspector a cup of coffee. We'll be in the lounge. No please don't trouble. No trouble at all, sir. Anything for a colleague. Excuse me. Well, you've made quite a conquest, Inspector. Yes. Tried to get you on the phone last night. I'm afraid I took the evening off. My pity. Something rather important came up. We discovered the address of Lorna Dawson. Might be useful, mightn't it? Oh very. Well done, Inspector. I knew it wouldn't take you long. But that isn't all. You mean you've caught the Python Murderer. Not yet, Mr. Graham. We had a tussle and he escaped through the window. He must've hurt his arm. About there. Did you catch a glimpse of his face? No, Mr. Graham. But I've been looking at a picture of his wife. You know his identity then? Yes. Have you enough proof to arrest him? No, I'm hoping I shouldn't have to arrest him. What do you mean? I'm hoping he'll give himself up before he runs amuck again. Again? Why should he? He wants to kill Lorna. But we've got her now. That means his revenge on the two people who killed his wife isn't complete. He'll never rest until it is. I know, I've seen it happen. Well, if you want him to give himself up, why not advertise that "Owing to the labor shortage, "Scotland Yard would be greatly obliged if he'd" come forward and volunteer to be hanged." Who knows? They might give him a peerage. Can't you see I'm trying to help him? I see only this. You've come here to hint that I'm somehow involved in the Python Murder. Everything you've said so far has been supposition. You've no evidence whatever. In the car that killed my wife there was one person. One, not two. And if I knew who that person was, I'd do to him exactly what the Python Murderer did to his victim. And I challenge you to prove it, Inspector. I challenge you. You have challenged me, Mr. Graham. And through challenging me, you've challenged the law. And through the law you've challenged all those things that your wife suffered and taught you to protect. But why not challenge one more thing? Your own conscience. You've broken so many codes, you shouldn't have broken the moral code too. You've done wrong and you know it. It's our job to catch those people. It's our job to punish them. It's our job now to punish you. But if you're the John Graham you used to be, I believe you'd help us do that job. I know you'd help us. No matter what the cost. Inspector, we have a lot in common. Whenever I'm stuck with a difficult cipher, I make the wildest guesses to try to break it. You're stuck with a difficult murder, and you've made a wild guess, and I'm it. I don't object because we're in the same line of business. But your guess won't come off. Won't it, Mr. Graham? Try it and see. Smoke? No thanks. Why not ask me where I was last night? You might catch me out at once. No. I'm sure you've arranged a very good alibi. It's not bad. But I will ask you one thing. Yes. Show me where your wife was killed. Certainly. Is this the spot? Yes. I'd like you to show me where you were standing before the accident. We left the car back there. Yes. We wanted to look at that field. I was thinking of buying it. She left the car there. I can't hear you, Mr. Graham. There. There. She crossed the road there. Let me finish for you. You looked up and saw a car coming down the road. It was travelling fast. Right? Yes. Your wife tried to hurry across the road. But suddenly she slipped and fell about there, right? You screamed to the car to stop, but instead it came hurtling toward you. She tried to get up but couldn't. The car came closer, it was almost on her. There were two people in it. That's the woman. [brakes squeal] Isn't it? That's the woman. You'd like to get at her, wouldn't you, Graham? You'd like to do to her what she did to Carol, wouldn't you? I've never seen this woman. Never. Never. [Davis] Get out. [car door closes] Take a closer look, Mr. Graham. I've never seen her. Take a closer look. [Graham] I've never seen her. Inspector, what's all this about? Yes, that's what I want to know. Why have you brought me here? [Davis] Do you recognize this man? I've never seen him before, in my life. [Davis] Think back to the night of the Windsor Murder. I was at the pictures the night of the Windsor Murder. I told you. Take her away. Come on. Don't you want her to hang for the Windsor job? Of course. If she did it. Then why don't you admit she was in the car? You're the only one who can identify her. Inspector, do you want me to perjure myself? Who, you? Of course not. [traffic noise] We want you. Carter. I thought I recognized you, sir. How are you, Carter? Oh, fine, thanks, sir. How's yourself? Fine. What're you doing here, sir? Lingering to commit a felony? Well, is there anything around here worth pinching? Well if there is the Superintendent will have it. As a matter of fact I was on my way to see if Inspector Davis were in. Oh, come with me, sir, I'll see about that. Thanks. My coders are doing a little job for the inspector. I want to ask one of your prisoners a few questions. Oh, who is the poor devil? Wrote the name down when he called at my office. It's not easy deciphering his writing. I'm familiar with his fist, sir. And his boot. It's the one with the tick against it. Lorna something, it looks like Dawson. Dawson, sir, Lorna Dawson. [Carter] Oh, I know her, a tough one. Had trouble with her two years ago. This is an awkward day to see her, sir. She's being transferred to Windsor this afternoon. Where is she now? Oh, they've got her down at Acton, but I'm afraid I have no authority to... That's all right, Sergeant. Did you get my message? Yes, and I read it. Good. John. The last time we used tire bursters was to rescue a prisoner from a Gestapo car. I wish I knew why you wanted them now. Jackie, do you remember when you asked me to keep certain things for you, in case anything went wrong? Yes. May I give you this? What is it? I suppose you'd call it a will. It's made out to Mrs. Reece and Peggy. I've nothing to leave them but a little money and some property. So will you from time to time keep your eye on them? And try not to let the old lady be lonely. Would you do that, Jackie? John, I can't let you go. Where's the car? It's hidden. Well, that's good. Hidden from you. I don't follow. I had to find out how far you were going. Now I know. I should have known the first time you came here. Jackie, where's the car? You won't find it. There's not a single car in this garage that'll move. I put them out of action. You're trying to put me out of action, too. We're going to the police, John. They'll help your friend for you. No, we were trained to do our own dirty work. That was then. You're not going to leave here. You're ill. Jackie, get away from me, please. I'm going to help you the only way I can. Whatever you've done, you're not going to make it worse. Let me go. You know there's nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you, you know that? Yes, of course. I know that, Jackie. Then you listen to me now. You're trying to throw your life away. More than your life, all the things your life stood for. But she's gone, Jackie. All the things my life stood for. You're not going to do it. But I tell you... You're not going to do it. All right, Jackie. Thanks. ## ## ## [explosion] [car engine racing] [screams] ## Good evening, Mr. Graham, sir. Some of this spice, sir? [various conversations] Mr. Graham, is anything wrong, sir? No, Johnson, no. That piece of paper, have you broken it? We've had no luck at all, sir. For the first time in years, I'm afraid we're beaten. Do they all feel like that? Yes, sir. The professor believes that it was coded on a key word, but he has no idea what. He hasn't? Which ones have you tried? All those on the left. The ones on the other side we're going to try. Well it's going to take a long time like this. You'll have more important jobs to be getting on with. [knocking on door] Could I have your attention please, just for a moment? We of this department pride ourselves that there's no such thing as an unbreakable cipher. Well, there isn't. But for only one reason that there's no such thing as an unbreakable person. The man who coded this piece of paper was no exception. He was broken long before his message was. So if you ever feel like giving up in the future, remember this. Keep on trying like you tried with this one. You made a lot of mistakes. But sometimes you were close to it. Closer than you knew. It was coded on a key word. A key word with five letters in it. The next time you're wondering what that vital word is, try... ## Carol. ## Don't think badly of them for not breaking it before. They're a good team. They'd have gotten it finally. Inspector? Yes. Do you remember that drink you were going to buy me? Yes. I could do with it now. [knocking on door] Come in. We've got it, sir. Good man. Read it, will you? It doesn't make a lot of sense, sir. Read it, please. "Present the nuisance. "A check for herself. "See she spends it. "Wool for knitting "Find out what color. "Books not many. "Tire her eyes. "A purse, a pen. "A gold locket inscribed in moss "If you look into it. "To my darling wife. "Who made everything all right. John." Thank you, Johnson. No, Mr. Graham. No. I suppose not. ## Well, Inspector. Well, sir. Carter, Stopford and Martin. And company, sir. And company. ## ## ##
