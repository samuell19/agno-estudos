[HORNS HONKING][SIREN WAILING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Miss Iglauer, how good to see you. The congressman is waiting at your table. Of course he is. How are you, Henry? How's your wife? Fine, thank you for asking. WOMAN 1: Edith! Loved your article. You tell your client I want an exclusive. Oh, you'll get it. Edith... Good to see you, Edith. How are you? Fine. Fine. How are you? Oh, pretty good. I have to get back to Washington today, though. All my stuff is stuck in committee. Oh, then let's cut right to the chase, shall we? If I write the piece on you, you're that much closer to leaving obscurity, but you already know that. If I don't, you're still a nobody stuck in committee. So please, don't have your staff tell me what you will and won't talk about, or I'll kill the piece. End of story... Literally. I'm sorry. I'll speak with my staff. Could we... Start again? [ELEVATOR DINGS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [TELEPHONE RINGING] WOMAN 2: Hey, you got the cover. Well, I always get the cover. He's here.Already? He showed up early to throw everybody off. [SIGHS] WILLIAM SANDERS: As your new managing editor, it's uh, it's my pleasure to be part of the proud tradition of journalistic excellence this magazine represents. But times change, and we need to change with them. Being late's not my idea of starting on the right foot. Well, it would have been nice if you had notified us you were starting today and that there was a meeting called. Check your e-mail. I'm sorry I didn't send out engraved invitations. As I was saying, Manhattan Magazineis famous for letting terrific writers tackle whatever topics they please. That's gonna change. Excuse me? Newsstand sales are down, subscriptions are down, which means ad pages are down... Which is a bad thing. [CLEARING THROAT] We're still making money. Not enough. Is it ever enough? Listen, we need to change with the times. The attention span of the American public is zip, so that means shorter pieces that aren't so dense. EDITH: With all due respect, what we like to think that we do here is literary journalism. So you'll forgive me if I think it's the new owner's attention span you're talking about, not the public's.You may be right, but we work for him, so he wins. By the way, you're all still here because I convinced him you could make the change. I understand principles. I had them... Before I had four kids. If this is a change any of you can't make, I'll understand, and I will gladly... [CLEARS THROAT] Sadly, accept your resignation. [MURMURING] EDITH: I've been here 15 years. I helped build this magazine into what it is today. I'm not gonna just roll over. Edith... A word? Uh-oh! I'm not scared of that little pissant. MAN 1: Oh, that's right, you're the star around here. He's probably just gonna kiss your ass. I wouldn't go that far. EDITH: You're kidding, right? Oh, no. Fish? Salmon, to be specific. As in broiled or poached? As in, uh, substandard and too expensive. You want me to do a sidebar on the price of fish? Not me, our new target audience. Who are...Younger people. People with less leisure time, less time to read. Bottom-liners, the ones who control the economy. Not the magazine's old audience, who are now sipping chicken soup in nursing homes. Maybe you haven't heard, uh, but my beat is politics, in-depth exposes, ones that we win awards for. [SIGHING] Don't care about awards. No money in them, or haven't you heard? It's a clip job. I'll have it to you by lunch. Just don't put my name on it. You... You're not following me. I want you to tell the story from the moment the fish is pulled from the ocean. Why? Nobody cares. Oh, but they do! I care. I'm curious. I want to know. That would mean you have to send me to a place where they fish for salmon. You got it. I got what? You'll go to BC. It's the only place left with gray salmon. As in British Columbia, Canada, BC? That's right. I'll pass.Oh, but I insist, because unless you're resigning, it's the story you'll write. I'll, uh, take that as "I'm gonna go pack now." Fish? Well, you said no, right? I didn't say anything. Now, leave me alone. No, it'll be good. I'm not sure how, but if anyone can get a story out of a fish, it's you. [SIGHING] Where's the town? Over the hill. How do I get there? Walkin' works. [CHICKENS CLUCKING] [DOG BARKING] Thanks, Mary. Excuse me, do you have a local newspaper around here? Yeah. Do they have an office? Right over there, above the gas station. You're kidding, right? Why would I kid you? Okay, so you're not kidding. [SIGHS] Thanks. Which one of them knows the most? John Daly. He's the unofficial spokesman for the fishermen. He's the real deal. Knows more about fish than anyone here. Great. But he won't talk to you. Why not?He's a loner. You're an outsider and you're a woman. Do his knuckles scrape the sidewalk, when he walks too? I just wanted you to know what you're up against. It's like a Greek tragedy, really. "Paradise destroyed." But you're not here to write about people's livelihoods being destroyed, are you? What did you say your hook was? The high price of fish. [CHUCKLING] What's so funny? Back in the days when I was a beat reporter for the Herald Trib, my editor used to give me these asinine assignments, always missing the real story. Drove me nuts. You just brought it all back. Where would I find this, uh, John Daly? At the bar. Everyone's there. They think that talking to officials will somehow change the course of the future, but the future rarely changes. Yeah, well, I don't know about all that, but I appreciate your help. Sure. Oh, is there a place to stay in this town? Only one place, Ruth's. Little B&B, just behind the bar. Can't miss it. Yeah, thanks. Hey... Good luck. MAN 2: The proposed dam will provide hydroelectric power for thousands of customers. It will create jobs. It will give this community economic strength. It can be built and operated with minimum destruction to the salmon habitat. [LAUGHTER] The Fraser River has the last remaining wild-salmon run on the entire Pacific coast, and you want to dam it up? I don't call that "minimum destruction." You're gonna kill a whole lot of them, every last salmon, and along with it, our way of life! And don't even bring up the fish farms, okay, 'cause you know they don't work, and we know they don't work. I mean, these fish are hatched like calves are caged. Their systems are compromised, so don't pull that one out of your hat. I mean, my God, these fish, they fight their way 800 miles upriver to get to those spawning gr...John! This is not the time...Just wait a minute! You take away those spawning grounds, you will kill all the salmon! And once they're gone, you don't get them back! There is no crisis management! It is over. Over. It's just that simple. MAN 3: That's right![CROWD APPLAUDING] Uh... Excuse me. Excuse me. The, uh, threat to salmon, has that been documented by an independent source? And you are? Edith Iglauer. I'm from Manhattan Magazine. I never heard of it. The city or the magazine? Oh, is that your interviewing technique, insulting people? I'm doing a story on fish, salmon, to be specific. [SIGHING] You ever been fishing? No. You ever been on a fishing boat? No. So why'd they send you? You, uh... Don't have to be an astronaut to write about space travel. Fish are different. Do tell. [SIGHING] Oh, brother. Now what am I gonna do? MARY: If you're looking for John Daly, you might as well fold up your tent, head on back to wherever it is you came from. I'm here to write a story... A story about salmon... The salmon crisis you're having? Rumor has it that John Daly is the man I need to talk to. He is, but, it doesn't matter, because he's not gonna to talk to you. Yeah, I know. But from what I heard in the meeting, I think I could help you all. You think you could take me to him? Please. I'm only doing this because we need national coverage if the politicians are gonna listen. This means everything to us. It's our way of life they're trying to kill, not just the fish. I hope even a city girl like you can appreciate that. The simplicity and the purity of the way we live and the way we want to continue to live. I love purity as much as the next guy. Can I call you Edith? Sure. I know everybody up and down this coast, Edith. We all do. We know everybody's heartache and their joy, and we share in all of it together. There's a comfort in that for us. And I know the story probably means nothing to you. It's just an assignment. But please don't dismiss what's important to us. At least, not to our faces. Go away! John, listen to me! The answer is no! She can help us! Let her help you! She doesn't want me! She wants you! Her words, not mine. Ah, jeez, Mary, I'm on the fish! I can't be taking some dilettante from New York who doesn't know the first thing about being on a boat! You owe me, John! This is an abuse of our friendship, Mary, and I'll never forgive you for it! I guess it's a cross I'll just have to bear! Don't worry, uh, we'll just do a couple of spins around the harbor. That is what you call it, isn't it... A harbor? And that'll be that. No big deal. [WINCING] What, you can deal with the fish when it comes wrapped in cellophane as long as you don't have to consider how it got that way? And you call that what, besides "killing the poor bastard"? [GRUNTING] [RETCHING] [COUGHING] Well, there's different kinds of salmon. We got chums. We call them "dogs." Then there's the pinks. They're not worth a damn. Your coho, your sockeye, and then, there's the springs. Don't forget the canned and the difference for those who care. Well, springs are the best. We call them "smileys" 'cause they pay the most. [WATER SPLASHING] Now, that is simple enough for you, isn't it? Mmm-hmm. Where's the bathroom? Or you can hang over the side. Get me off this boat! [ENGINE REVVING] Can you help me?Yep. Watch your step. Okay. So, what do you think of fishing so far? In the words of Mark Twain, "Fishing is a jerk at one end of the line "waiting for a jerk at the other end." Ah-ah! Don't forget the coat! I want another fisherman. [LAUGHING] Okay. And I need to throw up in a proper toilet, so where is that B&B somebody told me about? Oh, you'll hate Ruth. She's plain irritating. Um, just stay with me. You sure? Yeah, you can come throw up in my bathroom. Thank you. EDITH: He's pompous, arrogant, rude... Kind of like you? Excuse me? I meant that in a good way. You're sure of yourself. So is John. You're probably very good at what you do. So is John. And I'm sure you don't suffer fools well. Neither does John. Two peas in a pod, if you ask me. That's why you hate him. Thank you for the analysis, but I didn't ask you. My grandfather died trying to save the salmon. I'm sorry. How? It happened up on the Fraser River where the rapids are fierce. When the railroad came through, they, uh, blasted the cliffs, and the dynamite caused a huge rockslide that narrowed the river. And the rapids ran so fast that most of the salmon couldn't make it upstream. And if they didn't, they'd die. He put out a call to all the tribes, and they came. Men, women, children. And they started to clear the river one rock at a time. On the third day, he lost his footing, and he fell into the rapids. And, uh, he was swept out to sea. They never did find his body. The river, did they ever finish clearing it? It took years. The salmon run never did return to its old levels. Too many fish died before they could spawn. So what did you do? We tried to correct man's mistakes. It's all you can do. Oh, how, how would you even know where to start? There's so many of them. You start with one at a time. You can't pollute the air and foul the water and clear-cut the forest and pave the earth and dam the rivers and expect to survive. It may not be as clear to you, but, when the noise and the lack of kindness gets to you, maybe you'll understand then. Edith! How's it coming? Getting what you need? Sort of. "Sort of," what does that mean? It means it's taking a little longer than I thought. Uh, I got the wrong fisherman. I need to talk to another one. Well, how long? I, I don't know. What do you care? You're the one who wanted this damn story. Edith... [SNIFFS] How long? A day, two at the most. Gotta go! I hear the fish calling. [BEEPS] You brought me back to him? Are you kidding? He's the one you need to talk to. I'm not getting back on his boat. Oh, yes, you are! Oh, no, I'm not! He's the one that knows everything! Since when do you need to like the way you get the information? That's not the point. That's exactly the point! Don't you dare bring her near my boat, Mary! How come you're not fishing? And don't try to change the subject. Did they close the area? Yeah. Just when I hit a big school of springs. Listen, John, she'll be no trouble. She is nothing but trouble. Look, what the hell is your problem? Well, right now, you're my problem. I told you, I'm not getting back on his boat. Shut up, Edith. She's gonna do the story. The real story. I want you to talk to her. John Daly, stop with the nonsense and let her get aboard! All right, on one condition. Name it. No questions. She can observe, and she doesn't touch anything! I wouldn't dream of it. And she does what she's told. No talkin'. Deal. Edith? This is a waste of my time. I can't interview someone who speaks in grunts. John, will you promise to talk to her? [SIGHS] I'll do my best.EDITH: Ha, ha. Which isn't saying a whole lot. Edith? Fine. Watch your head.Mmm-hmm. [SIGHS] Well, I would say this makes us even. [ENGINE STARTS] Are you always so charming? Only when I really try. [SIGHS] [SPLASH] No. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. No questions, remember? [LAUGHS] You didn't really think I meant that. I'm a reporter, for God sakes. Well, I've got nothin' to say. I've written about presidents, royalty, people who never give interviews. I've stalked them and tracked them until it's easier for them to talk to me than not to. You think I can't get you to talk? Oh, brother. [CHUCKLES] One question. It won't kill you to answer. The sooner you talk, the sooner I'll leave. [SIGHS] What do you call that, what you're doing? "Dressin' the fish." Knife goes in here. Make one clean stroke up to the gills. Then you grab the guts, and you cut away the last little bit of entrails... [SPLASH]Then, you scrape away all the remaining blood so the fish won't go bad. Now... Your turn. Oh, like you said, I'm just an observer. No, no, no, no, no, no, we made a deal, and that involved you doing what I told you to do when I told you to do it. Well, that deal was made under duress, which makes it invalid. What are you gonna do, make me swim to shore? Don't tempt me. Oh, looky here. Lunch. [LAUGHS]I'm not eating the seagoing version of roadkill. Mmm-mmm-mmm. You don't know what you're missing. Do you treat all your guests this well? You're not a guest. Mind if I take a look? "If you're wondering, when you're standing in the checkout line "at Balducci's, "why the salmon you are going to poach "with a beautiful pouilly fuissé "is twice as expensive, "get out your map and look toward the north." [LAUGHS] That's superficial crap. What did you say?I said, that's superficial crap! Oh, and you must be a Pulitzer judge disguised as a fisherman. How silly of me not to know that. You know what dry rot is? No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me. It's caused by a fungus that worms its way into the wood of the hull. On the surface, everything looks great. But suddenly, one day... [SNAPS] ...the hull collapses, just like that. It's a good thing I don't... Write in a boat! Oh, it's all a game to you, isn't it? Who's up? Who's down? Your world, your politics, the media... You're all full of dry rot! Is that what you do out here on your boat all day? Just sit back and pass judgment on us lesser beings? Well, sometimes you gotta call 'em like you see 'em. And you must also have a degree in psychology somewhere around here. Oh, you can't take it, can you? Being on the receiving end for a change. What I can't take is you. Ditto. Just do me a favor. When you write that stupid story of yours and you and your friends are back there laughing at us, you tell them that their way of life is coming to an end right behind ours! Fine. I'm going downstairs. It's called "down below," not "downstairs." Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. HOWIE: [ON CB] Storm might be headin' in. JOHN: It's pretty clear here, over. Get any fish? Yeah, one or two. How about you? Hauled kelp all day.[SIGHS] There's always tomorrow. Good night, John.Good night, Howie. [SIGHS] Excuse me, why aren't we moving, like, back to the dock, to land? You see, we stay here tonight, we get a jump on the fish in the morning. You don't think I'm gonna sleep on this boat, do you? [CHUCKLES] Not much choice. I, I'll pay you any amount of money you want to take me back. [CHUCKLES] This is one place that your bribes won't work. This barely qualifies as a boat. Where in God's name would one sleep? In the fo'c'sle.The what? It's even got a bunk. This is your lucky day. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] They're sleeping pills. You need them when you're sleeping on wood. You know, if you ever did an honest day's work, you could throw those overboard. You know, some people view unsolicited advice as an act of hostility. Really? Well, I'll take that into account next time. I just wanted to tell you I was killing the lights. Thanks. Not that it'll matter. Why is there writing all over the walls? 'Cause I like it. Who, pray tell, wrote that? You? No. What does it mean? See, an Eskimo... He, uh, sold his gun to a tourist in exchange for his sports coat. And then, when winter came, when the Eskimo and his family ran out of food, he said he wanted to go hunting, but he had no gun. So his wife said, "Shoot 'em with your sports coat." Funny. [SIGHS] Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ow. You're gonna sleep the day away![SCREAMS] Oh. Oh, God. [SIGHS] This is barbaric. I need coffee! It's on the stove! Oh! Damn. Where's the cream? Same place as the bagels and the cappuccinos, not here! It's raining. Does that mean school's canceled for the fish, too? [LAUGHING] HOWIE: [ON CB] Morekelp, Morekelp, Morekelp. Little Hagar 2, Little Hagar 2. Little Hagar 2. Come in. John, it's Howie. They're closing the area. [SIGHS] When, Howie? Now. Alan's already headed in. He thinks the storm's gonna be bigger than the weather boys are saying. [SIGHS] Are they ever right? Almost never. Heard you got company. [HOWIE CHUCKLES]Bye, Howie. Bye, John. [SIGHS] Oops. Whoo! Am I a secret? Well, there is a reputation to consider. And they said chivalry was dead. Not yours, mine! They call closings every second. How does anyone catch anything? Wow. By George, I think she's got it. Did you mean for most of your scribblings on the wall to be hostile? Never thought about it. Then what's their purpose? Keep me grounded! What's that smell? What is it? Oh, my God. Ooh, ooh. [SCREAMS] Damn it! I told you not to touch anything! I didn't! I didn't! What happened? You started a fire in there, that's what happened! All I did was get some of your lousy coffee! That stove is a fine piece of machinery. It's not like some idiot-proof stove you got at home. Well, I... I didn't think...No, you didn't think! You don't follow directions very well either, do you? I'm sorry! I don't know how to use appliances from the turn of the century! I guess in your world, you're not used to your actions having consequences, are you? I said I was sorry! Let's leave it at that, shall we? In my world, sorry doesn't cut it, so just save your "sorry" for some other time, especially when you don't mean it! Just keep away from me, will you? Fine! Fine. I'm going downstairs. It's "down below"! You haven't learned anything, have you? Who cares what the hell it's called as long as I'm away from you! [SIGHS] Aft, fo'c'sle, stern, [DEEP VOICE] Down below. [NORMAL VOICE] Blah, blah, blah. Ah, brother. Hmm. [SIGHS] Oh, God. [WIND WHISTLING] I came up to apologize. Save it. You know, I thought it was fairly obvious that this boat is everything to me, but I guess it wasn't. I lose the Morekelp, I lose everything. But I guess you wouldn't understand that. I mean, all you understand are expense accounts and long lunches, huh? Let me set you straight about who I am... Look, it doesn't matter, 'cause you won't have the time. I'm taking you back. There is a God. [SCREAMS] Would you watch what you're doing? [CRASHING AND CRACKING] What was that? We hit a log! That's not good, is it? Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! This is the fishing vessel Morekelp! HOWIE: [ON CB] Come in. Come in, John! John, where are you? A mile east of Qualicum! We're taking on water! I'm on the other side of Lee's Bay! Try and get over to some shelter! This is the fishing vessel Morekelpoff Qualicum, request assistance! Repeat. Request assistance! Damn it! Maintain our course straight into the wind! Who... Who are you talking to? You! Just steer straight into the wind like you would your car! You do have a car, don't you? No fast turns! No hard ones! Easy ones!Oh. [CLANGING] [SCREAMS] Oh. Are you all right? You okay? Can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah. Damn it! What?The water cooked the radio. What... What are we gonna do? Well, first, I'm gonna block that window to keep the water out. Then what? I'll get back down below and try to fix that leak. What happens if you can't? Jeez, you ask a lot of questions! Well, I'd like to know how I'm gonna die, if you don't mind! Look out. [HAMMERING] Ow! Never, never, never, never trust the media! The media didn't do this. Weather did! Oh, no, no, no. If you hadn't been here, this never would have happened! You are the media. Only one other reporter once did a story on me. All lies. He didn't try to burn the boat down, though. Oh, God. [GRUNTING] [PANTING] We need to get you warm. Don't try to be nice now. I'm not. I won't say "I'm sorry" again. Good. It's an empty word for you. Look... I'm trying to be civilized in this moment of crisis, but forget it, because you are impossible. You should have done us both a big favor and stayed at home. For once we agree. What the hell was I thinking? What the hell were you thinking? What the hell was I thinking? You can't even steer your own boat. What did you say? You heard me. Oh, I'm being punished. That's it! That's it! I'm being punished for some unknown misdeeds. Oh, don't flatter yourself. You're not that important. I mean, aren't you supposed to not hit logs? I didn't see the log because you were flailing around all over the floor. We got to get you out of those wet clothes, so take them off! Ha. Tempting offer, but I'll pass. Look, you don't want to freeze to death, do you? Take off your clothes! No! Don't argue with me! Look, I'm fine. I am fine. Edith, the clothes are coming off one way or the other! Now, you can do it or I can do it. What's it gonna be? [SHIVERING] You need to put on some dry clothes. I can't. Everything's already wet or it's down in the hold. [BLOWING] Then you need to take off your clothes. If you freeze, I freeze. [SHIVERING] Take your clothes off. We can keep each other warm. Take your clothes off. Yeah. Yeah. The Coast Guard will find us, won't they? I'm not sure that they heard our location through all the static. Well, uh, but they, uh, they have radar, right, to find us? Radar doesn't always pick up wooden hulls. Oh... Oh... So... So what you're saying is that, uh... Nobody knows where we are? Yeah. Do you always have to tell the truth? It's a big, big character flaw. What about that little rowboat I saw out there? No. That's just a dinghy. We'd capsize in two seconds. [SIGHING] EDITH: I know I screwed up. JOHN: Hey, we all do. How many times has this happened to you before? Never.[SIGHING] That wasn't the answer I was looking for. God, I wish you were a liar. I can't die now. My obit wouldn't be long enough. We're lost at sea, we're probably gonna sink, and you are worried about your obituary? [CHUCKLING] Yeah. You were right, I'm shallow. Here, let's move around. Come here. You know, it's just that I'd like to think that my life mattered. What, do you need a newspaper to tell you that? No. Well, yes. Maybe. Maybe. So, what, the bigger the obit, the more your life mattered? No. The bigger the obit, the more everybody else knows my life mattered. [CHUCKLING] So... What would it say, your obituary? Let's see... "Intrepid journalist traveled the world seeking truth." Did she find it? Did I find the truth?Yeah. Fleetingly. And you? If you had to do it all again, would you do it all the same way? Yeah. You didn't even pause for a second. You're that sure? Yeah. And what about you? Would you change anything? Well, I... I guess the length of my pause gives you my answer. [POTS CRASHING] Hold on. Hold on. We're just gonna ride out the storm. Yeah. Okay.We'll ride it out... Just ride it out till it's over. Are you gonna answer my question? What would you change? Maybe everything. What the hell does that mean? That I've spent my whole life trying to get at the truth, but was it really the truth, or was it just what I wanted it to be? Was it just my truth? And at the end of the day, does anyone really care? Hey, hey, of course. Somebody cares. What about all the people in your life? I don't have very many people in my life. Why? I guess it's safer for me that way. Is it?Mmm-hmm. I think the world doesn't amount to very much without the people you love in it. Mmm. You ever want to slow down? I mean, from your way of life? When I was younger, I wanted to write the great American novel. Really?Mmm-hmm. Why didn't you? Didn't have the money. Huh. What about now? Don't have the time. [LAUGHTER] [WATER SLOSHING] What... What are you doing? I, uh... I need to get a rope to tie us together in case we have to abandon ship. But you said we wouldn't last two seconds out there. Yeah, well... Maybe we'll get lucky. Thanks. Edith? Edith, wake up. I'm sorry. I can't keep my eyes open. It's because of the cold. Now, Edith, wake up. We have to abandon ship. I'm... I'm staying here.You're not! We've got no chance if we stay here! She's gonna sink! We have no chance out there. You said so yourself. Edith... RICKY: [ON BULLHORN] John! John Daly! You in there? Ricky? John! John Daly! [LAUGHS] Who would've thought you brought me luck? John Daly! Ricky. Whoo-hoo! I've never been so glad to see your ugly mug. Whoo! ♪ My heart still aches at the memory... ♪ That's lovely. Didn't you see the deadhead? Oh, I wasn't paying attention, I was looking at something else. ♪ She told me that she'd wait for me ♪ Now, don't jump to conclusions, Alan. Where's Ricky? The man of the hour. Oh, you know him. He can't stand rubbing elbows with his fellow man for too long. Bravo, bravo.[ALL APPLAUDING] Sorry about your boat, Johnny, I know you loved her. That I did. Well...If Ricky hadn't expanded the initial search area... We'd be dead. Well, dig in.Yeah. I hear you, man. Hey, get them wobbly pops out of the freezer before they freeze. [ALL LAUGHING] You like that one, eh? How's your story coming? Good, I think. Are we gonna be in it? Yes, you will, Howie. Well, I don't know about anybody else, but I'm getting a little tired of beating my head against the wall about the government here. I mean, all I know is fishing. And they can talk all the job re-training crap they like. We are what we are. When's the vote? Final reading is in four months. [DOOR OPENS] Pumped her out five times. Threw a tarp around her. Toll line broke, twice. But I managed it. All right! [LAUGHS] Well, the old Morekelp back in action, eh? You mad man. Ooh! Ooh! Why would Ricky risk his life? Well, we live by different rules up here. You know, we depend on each other. If you're out on the water, and you ran into trouble, you know, the other fishermen are gonna do whatever they can to help you out. Well, my world doesn't work that way. I don't know how you can live in that world, you know. What do you put in this stuff? What aren't we putting in that stuff? [PIANO PLAYING] That's beautiful. Why, thank you. Have you read all these books? All fishermen aren't illiterate. I didn't mean that. [LAUGHS] Are you all right? Yeah. You know what's funny? I've always found solace in being an outsider, and tonight, with your friends, it's the first time in a long time I was sorry to be one. We didn't mean to do that. No, it's okay. I'm used to it. Why? Well, it allows me to stay objective. Oh. 'Cause that's a plus in your line of work? So they say. It's late. I better, uh, call a cab, and get over to Mary's. [LAUGHS] What? What's so funny? Well, we don't have a cab, and she's probably already asleep. Why don't you, why don't you sleep here? Oh, no, I've been a big enough burden already. Not at all, please. All right, if you'll get me a pillow and a blanket, I'll camp here for the night. Oh, no, no. You're my guest, you can sleep in my bed. [LAUGHS] Oh, I'm a guest now? When did I get upgraded? When you didn't quit on me out there. Thanks. Couch will be fine. Couch it is. [SIGHS] Now, my mother would row way out into the Irish sea. I can still see it, it was this little rickety wooden bathtub of a boat, and she would pull in hundreds of pounds of fresh salmon all by herself. She's the one who taught me how to read the water, and set my lines. Wow. She still alive? No, she died when I was eight. That's when my father came over here. He heard there was work in the canneries and brought me along. I never left. I knew I was home. Edith, where is home to you? It can't be New York. Why not?Well. I don't know, it's just hard for me to imagine all those people living on top of each other in those little boxes. Some of them are big boxes with a view of Central Park. How can you hear yourself think? Most of us don't want to. Well, that's a shame. Don't you ever get tired of the fight? I'm supposed to be asking the questions. Oh, sorry. One more. Depends on the question.Were you ever married? I was, a long time ago.What happened? Well, I thought then it was because he didn't understand how important my work was to me. And now?Now? I'm not sure. It's probably true. My work was more important.Ah. How about you? Why aren't you married?Oh, I was. And? Well, it turns out that she just couldn't live this life of mine, and I knew I couldn't live any other way. No point in trying. Oh. Loggers did this. See, most of the coho spawn in little creeks just like this, but if they're jammed up with logs, they can't. It's pretty simple, really, it's just like, somebody trying to block our way to where we have to go, but with the salmon they can't fix it, so... So, we have to. They won't spawn anywhere else?No. No, this is home to them. They always come right back home. So, what will happen to everyone here if that dam is put in? Well, first the fish will die off. Next will be the people. All of us. Simple honest workers, but we'll become extinct just like the wild salmon will be. I believe you call that "cause and effect." It's these fat cats who make their decisions from their high-rises, thousands of miles away from here. They don't care if they destroy the world, just as long as they win. Well, to hell with the diversity of nature that God gave us. They know better. But they don't know better. I mean, look at this, Edith. Look at what God gave us. Can you improve on that? Can they? It's everything to you, isn't it? Yeah, I guess it is. Well, are you just gonna sit there? Come on.Right behind you. In another month, you'll be able to walk across the backs of the coho crowding this creek. Listen, I want you back here, now. EDITH: I'm telling you, the high price of salmon is the wrong story. I have the story. Well, it can't be the wrong story because it's a story I sent you to cover. Look, just listen. The story is bigger, it's the destruction of the salmon. Oh, I don't care. Look, wrap it up and get back here. That congressman you were writing about, I heard a rumor he's under investigation for campaign financing. You wouldn't want another reporter to get that, would you? Nice try. [DIAL TONE] [SNIFFS] We give thanks for this food. And pray that we will never take any of this, your creation, for granted. Amen. Now, grilled salmon. Baby asparagus, fresh tomatoes and wild soro, all from my garden. It looks delicious.Yeah. So... You never wanted to be anything but a fishermen? Well, I thought about being a poet for a while, but, um, no money in it and I wasn't very good at it. Did you always wanna be a writer? Yeah, pretty much from the beginning. As far as I can remember.Uh-huh. What drew you to it? Well, uh, that I could organize and make some sense out of things. Express the rumblings in my head, and maybe let people know in the process something that they didn't know about, or only heard about, or only dreamed about. At least, that was when I started. What made that stop? Cold-hearted business, commerce, facts, no heart left in it. No room for it. Ooh, sounds pretty brutal. Mmm, it is. Tell you what, after dinner, I wanna take you somewhere and show you a little color for that article of yours. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, John, good to see you dry. [CHUCKLES] Gods were with you, Johnny. Oh, that they were, Kate. Good to see you. NORMAN: John. What will you have? It's on the house. Oh, that's a first, Norman. Edith? Oh, a cosmopolitan. What's that? Vodka, cranberry juice? Never mind. What do you have? Beer. Anything else? Dark beer. And dark beer it is. Two of those. So, uh, when's your deadline? Yesterday. I bet your editor is happy with you. Well, he's new. He'll get used to the way I do things. Oh, I'm sure he will. [ALL APPLAUDING] May I have this dance? [ALL APPLAUDING] So, you're not staying with me anymore, eh? [LAUGHS] I should make up the couch.Oh. Is that what you wanna to do? What do you mean? Well, now, that's a first. You asking me to explain something to you. What do you want? You really need to ask? Hmm, no. It has been such a long time. For me too. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SIGHS] What are you doing? Dressing the fish. The knife goes in here. One clean stroke up to the gills. Ah. And then, you grab the guts... That's my favorite part. [SPLASH]Not bad, huh? Well, that was great. Got yourself a job.[CHUCKLES] Well, 36 more to go. [CHUCKLES] Can I have another look? No. [CHUCKLES] Oh, c'mon please. I guess... Now that we've slept together I have to be a little nicer to you, don't I? Yeah. [CHUCKLES]Yeah. Tsk. Okay. [SIGHS] "The boats glide over the water as though they were messengers of God. "No obstacle slows their majesty down. "For their mission is as simple as time, "to supply sustenance, to give life in its simplest form. "And now the elements are not the only thing they must fight, "they must fight our ignorance for their very existence. "Because of us, because we do not understand, "and we do not want to understand, "they are our last hope. "When we lose them, we lose ourselves. "It is just that simple." What? What do you think? [SIGHS] It is as beautiful as a pen to paper has ever been. [ALL CHANTING] Their dances are prayers to God. A God who knows no color and no boundaries, no judgment, who provides for everything we need, not everything we want, who provides abundance because there's always enough. Even if we don't think so. We pray and dance that we live in faith and not in fear. Because in fear, you'll never win. There will never be enough. Wish I'd known that God. God is free for the taking. I'm almost finished and I'm paying for this outta my own pocket now, so why are you still screaming? WILLIAM: I am not screaming. I'm having a heated discussion. [SNIFFS] I don't care if you're paying for this out of your own pocket. That is not the issue. The issue is you're not doing what you've been told to do. And I want you back here, now. I don't care about the political ramifications of salmon fishing. I don't care about their livelihood. What I care about is the story I sent you to cover. And it's a no-brainer. I'll be back when I'm back. Edith. [SNIFFS] I will say this once and only once. If you're not back here in this office by tomorrow, you don't work here anymore. [SNIFFS] [DIAL TONE] Coffee, milk, eggs, lettuce, cherry jam... Great. They just called an opening up by the Queen Charlottes. It's grand. We need to get going. You're not coming with me, are you? Mmm-mmm. No, no, I can't. I've gotta go back or I'll get fired. It's been three weeks. I've pushed it as far as I can. When? Uh, this afternoon. I don't want you to go. I don't wanna go. Well, then stay. I can't. [SIGHS] Just when I finally got used to you. [CHUCKLES] You're the one who took some getting used to. I'll take you to the airport. No, I'd rather Mary did, I'm not, uh, much for goodbyes. Big, tough reporter. Not so tough. I guess I thought that we had shared enough, that we had a chance. Nah, that's pretty stupid of me. No, it's not stupid. But as wonderful as this has been, neither one of us is prepared to change. It's probably what we like most about each other. I'll come to New York to see you. [CHUCKLES] No. No, you won't. It's not for you. It's too noisy. I'll call you, then. Uh, John... MAN 4: John, come on, we're gonna miss the fish. Uh, I... You're right. I don't have your number. Yeah, I'll call you. You go. MAN 4: John!Yeah, yeah! You promise me? Yeah. You promise me? MAN 4: John!Go. You go, okay?MAN 3: John! Yeah! [RECORDER BEEPS] WILLIAM: Edith Iglauer, I'm sure you're back. and I'm sure you'll be back in the office in the morning. [RECORDER BEEPS] CARA: Hi, it's me, you there? Ugh, I can't stand not talking to you 80 times a day. What the hell were you doing up there? Call me. [RECORDER BEEPS] [SIGHS] Edith? Why didn't you call me? Uh, sorry. You okay?[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] Yeah.[ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS] I so don't believe you. WILLIAM: All right, 10 minutes. Ten minutes, this issue's out the door! The train is leaving, people. Printer won't wait. Oh, you better check this. Fearless Leader worked his magic on your copy. What the hell? You rewrote my piece. It needed some, uh, tweaking. "When you go to buy fresh salmon at Fulton market, "you can blame John Daly for those high prices?" You can't say that.Why not? Because it's not true. You can't do that to John, I won't let you.You won't let me? Since when did this become a democracy? You can't put my name on a piece that doesn't represent my work. Oh, Edith, I gave you the cover. Aren't you happy? I don't care.You used to. Well, I don't anymore. I want you to run what I wrote. I can't.Why? Because it's a bleeding heart piece of crap, that's why. Coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment. Edith, what is the problem here? This is business. The problem is that when I started writing, I had principles and somewhere along the way, I lost them. Well, I found them again. And this story is important and big and we owe it to them to print it the way I wrote it. I used to teach you ethics, so spare me the monologue, okay. You know what? You're impossible. It's like talking to a tree. Were you always this stupid, or did you just dumb down for business reasons? Keep it up, Edith. [CHUCKLES] Or what, you'll fire me? I don't care. Either you print the article the way I wrote it or you don't print anything. Fine. [CLEARS THROAT] Cara, get in here! We won't print anything.Yeah. Congratulations, you just got your first cover. Two minutes. Two minutes. Oh, uh, by the way, Edith, your next, uh, story is the mayor's breakup with his wife and her charges of adultery. William, you cover it, and then shove it up your ass. Oh, and did I forget this part? I quit. [CHUCKLES] Minute 45. Sorry, I haven't had time...Oh, yeah. Well, I missed you a lot. Yeah, well, it's only been a few days. Well, it seems like forever. Magazine's coming apart. I'm coming apart. You're always my anchor, Edith. I thought that would never change. I guess it's stupid to think things will never change. No, that's not stupid. Maybe, uh, just a bit naive. Hmm, well... You quit so easily. You see, that's the part I don't get. It's not like you. You always fought everything and everyone. What the hell happened up there? I mean to you. I don't know. I slowed down. I started to think about what kind of writer I want to be. Wow, so what're you gonna do? [CHUCKLES] I don't know. I don't know. The hell with you. What am I gonna do without you? You're gonna be the star, that's what you're gonna do. Well, it still isn't fair. You shouldn't be the one to leave. Maybe. But I did do one good thing. I gave my piece to the Ontario press. Maybe it will help John and his friends. So, what are you, their spokesperson now? No, but some things just jump out at ya. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It's a long story.Well... Justin, how are you? I'm better now that you're a free agent. Oh, well, news travels fast. Come work for me. Write your own ticket, whatever you wanna do. You think about it, and I'll call you in the morning. Hi, I'm Cara Lieb. You must be Justin Cavanaugh. [LAUGHS]Well, thank you for that introduction. You're gonna take him up on his offer, aren't you? I'll think about it. You'll think about it?Yeah, I'll think about it. Okay, you need a drink, big drink. Excuse me, two. EDITH: Come on, cheer up. It's not the end of the world. Yes, it is. You're a good writer, Cara. You'll probably end up being a great writer. Okay, now you've just confirmed my suspicions. You are certifiably insane. Hey, you got your first cover, didn't you? Oh, by default. It's not the way I wanted it. I mean, it wouldn't be so bad if... But... What? [GASPS] It's him, isn't it? It's... John. The John. The Hemingway-without- the-angst meets the role of the mother- doing-the-laundry John. Yeah. Well, did you happen to notice he just exudes testosterone? I don't think you can teach that, I think you're born that way. Definitely born that way. Hi.Hi. I was in the neighborhood. [LAUGHS] What are you doing here? Well, you said you'd call, and when you didn't, I had to come and make sure you're all right. Are you? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Good, I was worried. [GIGGLES] How did you find me? [LAUGHS] Went to your office and I told them I was your long-lost brother. And they said that if you weren't at home, this was the only other place you'd be. I brought you a present. May I help you?He's with me, Henry. Sorry, Ms. Iglauer, shall I take your coat, sir? Yeah. And your igloo? Thank you. Brought you some fish. Coho. From the stream we cleared? The very one. Hi, you must stay for dinner. Oh, no, no, no, I don't mean to intrude. Oh, but I insist. WOMAN 3: I simply have to figure out a way to get a cameo on Nora's next film. Mort Zuckerman played a homeless man in his last movie. WOMAN 4: A billionaire publishing magnet slumming. Sort of...[LAUGHTER] Calvin Trillin played a sheriff. No.WOMAN 3: Andy Warhol was right. Everyone needs their 15 minutes of fame or you simply haven't lived. Oh, cheers! To our 15 minutes! So, are you going to the Hamptons this weekend? Oh, I don't know. It's just not the same. So many renters and movie people. So, Madeline tells me that Barbara bought herself into the board. Imagine, had I had known, I would have written a check. Long ago. [LAUGHS]You need a drink, my dear man. After your admirable trek to get here. [LAUGHS] Uh, get the lusty man of the sea some grog. We want him to feel at home, right?[LAUGHTER] Hayward...It's all right. Um, do you have a bottle of Chateau Petrus? What year, sir? Um, '75 if you have it, otherwise, I'll settle for a '78. Very good. I think that should cover it. Very good, sir. [HAYWARD CLEARS THROAT] Well. [CLEARS THROAT] Thanks. How's Mary?Good. Howie and the guys?Good. That's all the small talk I can come up with. Why'd you come here? 'Cause I missed you. And I hoped that if you saw me, you'd admit that you miss me too. Then what? What if I missed you? What do I do with that? I don't know. You could come back with me. [SCOFFS] I, I can't. Why not? Because...Because, why? I'm sorry, I don't know what else to say. Say you'll come back with me. You shouldn't have come.Edith. I love you. Damn it, I just told you I loved you. What are you afraid of? Turns out, everything. Well, just give us a chance. I want to, John, but I can't. I... I... I don't know how. I have a life and it's here. You're so afraid of living, you wanna spend the rest of your life not living, just watching? You pay a big price for that, Edith. It's a price I'm willing to pay. Ah. Well, then, you were right. You do belong here. Why are we all here? I mean, really? What?Why are we all here? You mean on this planet? No, in this gym. Uh, because we're shallow, we wanna look it. Exactly. And how ridiculous is that? I mean, we're all sweaty and smelly and trying not let anyone know who we really are. We're like rats on a wheel except we're on a StairMaster. You people are delirious. For the first time, I have total clarity. No, you wanna have a metaphysical conversation, I can barely breathe. You're insane. This is insane. Okay, you are losing it. You really need to get off that thing now. You're right, you're right. Edith, I was... I was joking! Edith... Are we still on for lunch? [EXHALES] Hello, John! Are you coming out on the herring with us today? Well, what's his face, Winston, says he brought in 20 ton over the weekend. That man is a congenital liar. That's why you can't believe nothing you read in that New Testament, eh. Because most of the witnesses to the major events are all fishermen. [ALL LAUGHING] John. John! John!For God's sake, I'm not deaf. Hi. Hi. I was in the neighborhood. I cooked the salmon you brought me. Turn out okay? Perfect. You had the politicians falling all over themselves to try and do the right thing. That was the goal. Thank you. On the plane, I was thinking. Wondering, really. How do you... How does one fall in love? How does it actually happen? And I realized, I don't know. All I know is that it happened to me with you. When I see you, I don't wanna stop seeing you. When I look away from you, all I wanna do is look back and find you. Edith...No, wait, don't say anything. Let me finish. Your showing up like that in New York in the middle of my life, made me look at my life. Didn't fit anymore. I don't know if it ever really did. The only thing that made sense to me was you. That's why I quit the magazine. I don't wanna hide behind questions anymore. So, if the offer is still on the table, I wanna stay here. With you. [ALL APPLAUDING] [ALL APPLAUDING] As your friend, though, I'd like to say to you, I hope that you will listen to one another. And listen carefully. For God has given us the gift of you. And given you the gift of each other. As you head into your new life, be gentle with one another. May God work through you and with you. John and Edith Daly. [ALL APPLAUDING] So, due to local opposition, and a couple of misleading articles, the Government of Ottawa has rejected the construction of the Fraser River dam. [ALL CHEERING] EDITH: What I know now, is that we spend our lives searching for things. For love, completion, purpose. And we look so hard for it that we miss all of it. It's when we're still that we find it. I never knew that until I met John. I was finally home.
