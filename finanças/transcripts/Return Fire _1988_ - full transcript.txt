This guy's good, he's really good. I know we can take him. I just need some more men. - That's hardly the point. Look, this man has caused serious damage to me in central America and I want him dead. I find your performance unacceptable. I'm gonna make an example of you. You've been with me a long time Nick I'll take care of Maria and the kids.

We want you to do one more job for us. You want Zak, we want Petroli. We're in this thing together Steve. You can take any one of my agents as a backup. You get Zak, we find Petroli you take him out you have your son. We'll make it worth your while. Don't you think you owe it to us for botching the central America? - I did my job and was left stranded. - Your mission was a failure. The ambassador and the chopper pilot never got back. - The mission was never supposed to succeed. - Steve, we go back a long time. I gave you your first assignment. You've always been my number one, man. - That was a long time ago. - Listen Steve, you want Zak, we want patrolling. Time is running out. Think about it. - Just keep your people outta my way.

I had no idea what you were walking into but I wouldn't have blown my cover even if I had. I'm sorry about your son. What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna find my son and I don't care what I have to do to get him back. - Look, word at the agency is Petroli operates out of an abandoned cement factory just outside of town.

The agency needs money. - If our friends don't get some ammunition soon the whole scam could be over in a matter of weeks. - You've got two tons of hardware ready to move. You pay half of what you owe, we'll talk - Done. Tell Leo he'll have his shipment by Monday. - What the hell is this all about? - Poor Mr. Hartman, you really don't understand do you? I know you've been running an investigation into my activities. Mr. Carruthers has given you to me so that we may find out everything you know. - Fuck you. - Find out what he knows. (Hartman grunts) - That's the last of it. - That's good girls, that's enough for today. Have a good weekend. Don't worry. We'll handle it. Strat and I are going out.

You get some sleep, tomorrow we're gonna have a big day. - I love you, dad. - I love you too.
