Give him to us. We need him. Out of the question, children. I baptise you Balthazar, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Marie! Marie! Marie! Receive the salt of wisdom. Jacques... Marie... Jacques! Jacques! Jacques and Marie See you next year. THE YEARS PASS That's him! PROPERTY FOR SALE Marie! Marie! Come and see. Look... 200 hectares of land ready to harvest. I, a school teacher, did it all. I learned everything from books. Those fields aren't ours, nothing is. It doesn't matter, we'll still be happy. What a nice donkey, he moves so fast. Very modern. She probably likes love. Him, too. Him, too - what? He probably likes love, too. -Won't you say who you mean? -Sure. A donkey? Shhh! In mythology... What...? SOLICITOR "As it is too painful to return, now that my daughter is dead," "and not having sold the farms," "why don't you run them using modern methods?" "You once told me you'd like to try." "You'd have to stop teaching to do so." Go on. "Enclosed is my authorisation to farm the properties." "My solicitor will advance you enough money to begin." "I trust you completely and give you free reign." "You need not render accounts..." And now, suddenly, I'm to render them for your verification. That's right. What if I refuse? Nothing says I have to. I wouldn't advise that. There's enough gossip already. Gossip? Take the donkey home, I'll walk. When the woods were first sold, we started to receive anonymous letters. They alleged that your father had cheated mine. Without proof, of course. How vile! Envy and jealousy cost your father his success. Dad is beyond reproach. He needn't be ashamed. I've come to settle all this. Did your father believe it? No. Dad was very hurt. He never asked for any thanks. Yes, it's Balthazar. Balthazar... Everything's still the same. But you, Marie, are even more beautiful. Prettier, more beautiful than ever. Remember what I promised you here years ago? That I'd love only you. But I'm not sure I love you, Jacques. Is it so hard to know? I don't want to mislead you. Are you happy to be with me? Yes, Jacques, very happy. Marie! Marie! Speak to him alone. I'll wait. Don't let this business come between us. Are you leaving? Will we see each other again? If you weren't so proud, matters would have been settled. Why should I make the first move? The boy was on your side and you threw him out. Give them the accounts. That's my business. I'm not accountable to anyone. Anyway, I can't find them. Never mind the insult. Don't play into enemy hands. The courts will decide who's right. If Marie continues to lock herself away, and not feed Balthazar, why keep him? That antiquated donkey make us look ridiculous. Come, now! We must avoid ridicule at all cost. Balthazar. They say he does odd jobs for him, like chopping wood. He's very obliging. In return, the priest excuses all his pranks. -Why did you take him on? -He's here on trial for a week. Good night, Gerard. Good night. Balthazar... Get out! Right now! I'm warning you. Where are you going, Marie? Nowhere. Then come back. What are you doing here? Just looking for what is mine. I'm not a thief. Clear out! Marie! Now! What's wrong? Gerard is wonderful, he's got everything ready for baking. - Was it you? Gerard? - Me? Don't deny it. If you borrow money, ask first. Of course. If you need something, say so. I don't want you to go short. I bought you a present. What is it? Look over there. But I'll take it all back, if I see you with that Marie again! Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie! Gerard! Where have you been? "POLICE SUMMONS" I'll hide you. Escape over the border tonight. Don't mock me. Don't scorn my tears. Why should I keep quiet? You've been misled, sir. Who asked you? They wouldn't have the guts. Braggarts, weaklings, I'd spit on them. Give them here. You'll get them back later. Your hands, your thumbs... Are you arresting me? Not yet, but we're keeping an eye on you. You can go. Drop dead, bastard! That's my private business. I refuse to answer. Then explain why your friends answered. Explain? Is it up to me to explain? Since you suspect me... maybe I am your man. Who? Who? The murderer. How? When? Alone? These gentlemen had no part in it. You said you'd never even thought of smuggling, that you'd never been near the border. I wanted to avoid the police. Enough nonsense! Arrest this man! I'm innocent, I swear! For obstruction of justice. You'll go to jail for your stupidity. Get out! What do you want? You know too much about us. Informer! Get a move on! I defended you. Get a move on! You tried to involve us. You're the murderer, Arnold. Rubbish! Rubbish? A drunk like you? The next day you'd forget you'd done it. Beat it! Why else would they take your fingerprints? Murderer! So why didn't they arrest me? -The law moves slowly. -How slowly? Months. Maybe a year. Liar! -Say that again. -Liar! Liar! Lia... Stop! Coward! Look how he's shivering. He's been like that for 2 months now. -Poor beast! -This won't take long. Stop! Stop! Murderer! I'll take him off your hands. He's incapable of getting up. I'll take him. Being on the road cured him. On my canvas appears a multitude of forms, independent of me. Each with its own dialectic. The waterfall will dictate to me, with no logical rapport between us. Its falling will activate me. A cerebral painting? An "action painting". Can one be held responsible for an unwitting crime, which one can't remember having committed, as a result of stress or drinking? The subconscious takes over. Even the unconscious. Next day there's no trace. The criminal doesn't even know he is one. Not the scaffold! Not the scaffold! Ah, my poor head! I swear by the Virgin Marie, Jesus and all the saints, that i will never drink again. Amen. What are you afraid of, Arnold? Fear. You're crazy to leave in mid-season. You devil! Bringer of bad luck! Don't walk out on the court, I implore you. -He's insulting me. -Not at all. A real court wouldn't allow me to be insulted. If you leave now, you'll be found guilty by default. I'll take him on. You're wasting your time. No, he's most intelligent. You mean he's talented? Ingenious... Ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to present the century's most powerful brain. Would someone give me a three-digit number? -772! -834! Now, any number between 2 and 9. -7! -3! Our mathematician will now do the multiplication. Now a five-digit number. 12,635! 14,721! 14..721 Another three-digit number. 632! Arnold! Hurry! Wake up! Run for it while there's still time! Too late. Look who's here. You came back, you idiot. Lucky I brought you a gun. It's empty. Get up, Arnold! I have some great news for you. Come in! Arnold is buying the drinks! Come on in! Everyone's shouting Arnold! So, he has come into money? Thanks to his uncle's will, Arnold has inherited quite a fortune. The validity of the will is indisputable. There are just a few formalities... -I knew you'd come. -So? You're spying on me. I wanted to know what you were doing. What do you see in that boy? I love him. Love can't be explained. If he says come, I do. I do whatever he says. Poor child! I'd follow him anywhere. If he asked me, I'd kill myself for him. What, not smashing anything up? You're not all worked up? Drink, you half-wit, drink! Asshole! Social parasite! Your father is suffering. He only lives for us. He won't survive his grief. He loves his grief more than he loves us. It's all I ask. Come home with me, or you'll be forced to come back. Save me, take me away, far away! Your father will kill you. Father is sick of me. If you want her, pay. Arnold... My brother... Are you leaving us, Arnold? Yes. Long live Arnold! Long live Arnold! Goodbye, my cherished friend. Condemned to stay here and watch those fools go by. Goodbye, old pal! And you, my comrade... The death certificate was sent over 2 weeks ago. If there's no heir, we'll sell off his belongings. They'll go to market. He's chafed. He needs a proper harness. It's not worth it. I'll scrap him when the rains come. Don't make me leave. Go back home to your father. I can't and I won't. He used to have status. You've dishonoured him. It's over with Gerard and his mates. I can't stand them. All I ask is a place to stay. Let me sleep on the straw. How kind you are. If you like... I'll kiss you. Dry yourself. Come here. Give me your skirt and blouse. -Did anyone see you come here? -No. How ugly it is here! It's a place to die in... with nothing to regret. Who's talking about dying? I am. Do you believe in anything? Yes, in what I own. I like money, I hate death. You'll die nonetheless, like everyone else. I'll outlive them all. You're old. Not as old as all that. You're ugly. Let me eat, you old miser. I'm starving. They say you hide your gold in your boots. What's the good of that? There, take it. You're rich, yet you have no electricity. We have nothing left at all. Not even the house is ours. Father gave the creditors his last penny. That's what happens when you put honour first. Your father spent his life taking on obligations. For what? Not one person in ten believes in his innocence. Do I have any obligations? I'm free. I'm only obliged to do what benefits me, what brings in a profit - preferably a big profit. Life is but a fair, a fair where words aren't needed. Bank notes will suffice. If you pay people, you owe them nothing. It's even better if they work for nothing. Not everyone sees things the same way. You learn that you can do what you want and still be respected. It's a matter of nerve and audacity. Take it back! It's not money I need, but a friend. Yes, a friend... A friend who'll tell me how to escape. I've always wanted to escape. Escape? Yes, run away. A friend who'd share my pleasures and my sorrows. I'll share them... but I hope I'll have more pleasure than sorrows. She was here an hour ago. You gave her food and shelter? She eats... She'll come back, like a long-lost child. Yes, you will be reconciled. He's no longer young... but he's a good worker. Take him! Marie will be pleased. I haven't forgotten, I still owe you a little. Not exactly a little. Take him and we'll call it quits. No, no. My little girl! Marie! Everything was ruined, just as it was about to succeed. So much has been swept away in such a short time. Things must be remedied. How? My father wants me to return the money yours lost. He won't accept it. He suffers in silence. He's locked up in his pride. Marie. How often i've dreamed of you, or someone like you, Jacques. Someone honest, a bit silly, who'd say to me: "Be mine...", "It's not your fault." What isn't your fault? Enough to shock you... and drive you mad. Now you know everything. Do you still want to marry me? Yes. You'll be ashamed of me? No. You'll never blame me? Never. You commit yourself for life. Yes. But Jacques, marriage is... out of date. We'll still marry. We'll be poor, but I'll work hard. You bore me, bore me. Don't get angry. You still see our names on this bench, our games, Balthazar... but I see nothing, Jacques. I feel nothing, I have no heart or feelings. Your words no longer have a effect on me. Our declarations of love and the promises we made were just fantasy. It wasn't reality. Reality is something else. I will love him, love him... Hurry, I don't want to be late. Don't go. Let them be! I want to have it out. Marie... They stripped her, beat her and locked her in. Marie! Marie! Marie is gone. Gone? She'll never come back. He's in a state of despair. Comfort him. There must be forgiveness... for all. You'll be forgiven, because you have suffered. Perhaps I suffer less than you think. "The lord does not shun us forever." "Though he causes grief, he also has great compassion." "For he does not willingly afflict the children of men." Dear God, don't take him from me too. Wait! You know how sad and miserable my life will be. Lend him to us. He's worked enough. He's old, and all I have. -Just for a day. -What's more, he's a saint. Perfume. Stockings. Gold.
