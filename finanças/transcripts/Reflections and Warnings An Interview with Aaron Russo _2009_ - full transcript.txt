You're rolling. What happened on 9/11 is a phoney, you know. And we've never learned the truth about 9/11. The whole agenda is to create a one World Government where everybody has an RFID chip implanted in them. All money is to be in those chips. And this is given to me straight from Rockefeller, who said this is what they want to accomplish. "Aaron, what do you think Women's Liberation was about? We the Rockefellers funded that. We funded Women's Lib." They do whatever they wanna do. What we want doesn't matter anymore. It's their agenda, it's their plans that matter. They have all the money they want. They can make all the money they want. They have a machine, they can make all the money. It's not about money. It's about control, it's about their vision of how they wanna see the world. You hear George Bush saying: "Democracy, it means freedom." No. Democracy equals New World Order. I believe God put me on this Earth to be the best person I could be, and put everybody on this Earth to be the best they can be. You have to stand up for what's right in life. Unless you do that, you are nothing. Award-winning film-maker turned freedom fighter, Aaron Russo was an amazing individual. You know, he'd been battling cancer for more than 3 and a half years when he began making America: Freedom to Fascism that he shot, directed, edited pretty much on his own with just the help of a few people. An amazing individual! A long life of award-winning films, of hard work and of standing up for the Bill of Rights and Constitution. You know, when we first went to shop this interview, I put it on the web for free. But parts of it have never been seen. So here today, you're gonna have a chance to see the in-depth interview, the final interview with Aaron Russo. But his important work lives on. He made one of the definitive films exposing the elite that control this nation and the world, the private Federal Reserve. And the information he put out 2 years ago rings more true today than ever. And his film America: Freedom to Fascism and Mad as Hell and the other great works he did - just continue, like ripples on a pond, to light bushfires in the minds of men and women everywhere. So this film is dedicated to the one and only Aaron Russo! You're rolling. I'm honored to be interviewed by Alex Jones, a truth seeker fighting for justice in America. -Nice & charming get me all smiley. Aaron, when did you start to think something was wrong in the world, start to find out about the whole banking cartel, the Federal Reserve System, about the New World Order? Well, that was a progression of events. I've always been a very independent person, always believed in individuality and that we were put on this Earth to be unique individuals to fulfill our God-given potential. And that the only way to fulfill your potential is to be free, to find out who you are and to make errors, to make mistakes. And as I grew up, I began to realize more and more the government was inhibiting me in things that I wanted to do. And what happened: I was very successful in the ladies' lingerie business, I worked for my dad, he had a small undergarment business. And I created the first ladies' bikini panties back in 1963 actually. And then, I opened up a nightclub in Chicago called The Electric Theater that opened up the day Martin Luther King was assassinated. Wow! So the City of Chicago was in flames the day my club opened, and nobody came out to the club. And what happened was that there was the Democratic Convention in Chicago in '68. So my club became a hang-out for the hippies, you know, cause they wanted to go to Chicago and protest what was going on. I was having a concert at my club one night to raise money. And the police raided the nightclub, my club for no reason at all. I was standing outside in my office overlooking the street. And I saw all these party wagons pulling up in front of my club. I was a 24-year-old kid. I had no experience at all, really. So what are these party wagons doing here? And then I saw all these cops getting out of the party wagons, coming into my club. Oh, my God! They're raiding me! So I ran down to the stage, and I got on the stage, I stopped the band from playing. And I said to the people in the audience: "We're being raided. So sit down on the floor, cooperate. Provide your identification and cooperate with the police." As I said that, two of the cops from behind threw me onto the floor and grabbed me and started dragging me out of the club. And I'm going, you know: Victory! Victory! It was worth at the time, I was a kid. Then I saw the fire department there, the fire department was dumping garbage cans, the garbage all over the floor. I thought to myself: "Why were they doing that?" Very quickly, as they were dragging me out. I didn't quite understand it. So they threw me into the party wagon. As I got to the party wagon, one of the cops grabbed my testicles from behind and squeezed. And I went to the party wagon in gigantic pain. The next person that came into the party wagon, as he was stepping in, the cops took their billy club, smashed him on the head with it, and just split a scull. For no reason! I mean, there was nothing wrong! So that was kind of your awakening. That was my awakening, it's like: what is going on? I thought this was America. I earnestly blamed it on Chicago, on Mayor Daley, thinking it was Chicago. Anyway, it was the headlines of the newspapers the next day. There was my picture in the newspapers, the headlines: "Electric Theater short-circuited, it was raided." And in the article, they went ahead and they said that the reason they raided the club was because the fire department came there and saw it was messy, full of garbage, and the hippies started attacking them, which was totally not true! Those turdy hippies! It was totally false! It was a complete fabrication! So they ran a false flag on you? They framed you? Yeah, of course! I was in shock! People lie like that? People actually do these things? I couldn't believe it! It was an awakening to me! And I went on television, I told people on television that they lied. Nobody cared! Nobody cared what the truth was! It was shocking to me! Then a week or two weeks later (I forget exactly when it was), two cops come to see me, Lieutenant and a Sergeant, or Captain and a Sergeant. And they said: "Mr. Russo, we're sorry if you got hurt that night at the club, in the raid. But we're here to tell you that if you wanna keep the club open, it's gonna take $2,000 a month. We can come see you once a month. Whenever we have to raid you, we're gonna call you. And we'll let you know we're gonna come in tonight and raid you." -This was mafia! -The police mafia. It was actually more interesting than that. They said: "Listen, there's the A plan, there's the B plan, and there's the Super Deluxe plan. Each one will cost you that much money a month. Which one do you want?" What was the Super Deluxe? That's the one I took. That was a $2,000 a month plan. I took that plan, I paid them $2,000 a month, and they left me alone. And whenever they were gonna raid the club, they would call me: "We're gonna raid, we have a phoney raid tonight just to look good for the people in the neighborhood." So that was your first brigantic action? That was my education into corruption and government. But I really thought that was basically Chicago. I didn't realize it was the whole country like that. So that was my wake-up call that people lie and cheat and steal. I thought everybody was always honest and nice and decent. I had no idea about any of these things. Well, what happened to me was that one day they came to me and they said: "Look, we can't take your money anymore." I said: "Why? What's up? What's going on?" They said: "We have to close your club. There's elections coming, and the aldermen in the neighborhood don't want you open anymore. So we can't take your money." So I had to go to court and fight them, and they were trying to close the club. Then one night there was a fire, and the club never reopened again. The club just closed then. That was the end of the club, and they've brought me down. That was the end of my experience. Then I moved back to New York where I met Bette Midler. I ran into her at a little nightclub she was playing called the Improv. I thought she was fabulous, and through a series of events, I began managing her. As soon as I started managing her, her career took off like a rocket. We've been very, very successful. Through managing Bette, I started producing shows on Broadway where I won the Tony. And I produced television show, I won the Emmy with Dustin Hoffman and Bette. Then I produced The Rose for her, for which she got Academy Award nominations. That led me to producing Trading Places, which everybody knows. That makes the best Eddie Murphy movie. Well, that's a good one. Not obviously the best, but that's a really good one. And I'm very proud I made that movie. So in my mind, I feel as if I'd made a classic comedy in Trading Places, a classic musical in The Rose, and a classic documentary in Freedom to Fascism. So I'm very proud of my work that I've done as a film-maker. Aaron, why do you do this? What's the philosophy of your life? What do you think life's all about? I think the importance of life is to like yourself. If you don't like yourself, nothing means anything. To like yourself means you have to respect yourself. To respect yourself means you have to take actions that you'd respect if somebody else did them. And what's the point of living if you don't like who you are? You can have all the money in the world, and if you look in the mirror and you don't like what you see there, what's the point of it? So to me the most important thing is that I like who I am and that I take actions that I would respect if somebody else did them. Then you live a life of character, honesty, truthfulness. And I believe that a person has the ability to mold their character like a sculptor can mold a piece of clay. There's an old saying: the leopard never changes its spots. I don't believe that. I believe people have the total ability to mold their character into what they choose to be in their life, what their ideals are. And that's what I've tried to do with my life. I am not the same person today I was 30 years ago. I've changed a lot, cause I wanted to be something better than what I was before. And my philosophy is that you have to like yourself, you have to be a decent person with character and integrity and honor. That's what's important. Back in the late '80s, I was a pretty big silver trader and gold trader. I haven't ever told the story on tape before. I was a pretty big silver and gold trader. And I always paid my taxes. I took what was a legal tax deduction on my silver trades. A few years later, I think it was '88 or '89 or something, the IRS claimed that what I did, and other people did as well, was now illegal, we couldn't do it anymore. But they made it retroactive. So what do you mean retroactive? It was legal then, I did what was legal. They said: "Yeah, but now we're making it illegal retroactively. And it's not good, so you owe us $600,000-$800,000." For what? It was legal! How could you make something retroactive? Change the law backwards in time. It makes no sense! Why're we doing it? So everybody said they can't do that, so we went to court, a class action law suit. And the judge agreed with the IRS and said they could do it retroactively. That's when I knew that there was something wrong in America with the IRS and the system here, you know. Aaron, you were telling me the story last night. And before you even finished saying: "In the late '80s, the tax law..." I said: "Retroactive." And I knew that, because they literally ruined my dad, but he paid. He didn't know, he still thought this was America. And it was legal tax law, what are you supposed to do? They said retroactively you owe and with... Not just retroactive, but they said: "You owe us penalties and interest." -That's right. -So how do you owe penalties and interest on something when they retroactively changed the law? Well, first of all, they can't retroactively..., How can you do something retroactively? Penalties and interest are a farce. All this cause they do whatever they wanna do. That's what I realized: America is not America. It's not the land that I was taught it was. Cause they can do whatever they wish to do. And there's nothing the citizen can do about it. Now, you made America: Freedom to Fascism. I'm gonna walk through that film, I wanna encourage everybody out there to get a copy of it on DVD. It was also in theaters around the country. I think, the best film out there on the Federal Reserve and the IRS and the whole banker's scam. And I want to discuss that with you here. But I wanted to go back a little bit to the point that we discussed last night where you don't advise people to not pay. And I do the same thing. People say: "Well, you say it's a scam, but you say go on and pay it?" -And I liked the way you summed it up. -Well, it's really fairly simple. I mean, since making that movie, many people've come to me and asked me whether they should pay their income taxes or not. And I never advise people not to pay. The reason I tell them, I said: "Look, I've done a lot of research. The Supreme Court has ruled that the IRS has no authority, the 16th Amendment does not give the IRS the authority to tax your labor and your wages." That's a fact. The Supreme Court is the law of the land. And the IRS has not trumped the Supreme Court. However, that being the case, the fact is if the mafia would come to you and say: "We want $2,000 a month or we gonna hurt you," I would not advise you not to pay them, cause you make it hurt by not paying them. Whether it's legal or not doesn't necessarily matter. You gonna get hurt if you don't. It's the same thing with the IRS. They can hurt you. They can put you in jail. They can torture you. So if you don't pay them, you make it hurt. So I never advise people not to pay. I tell people: "Yeah, pay your taxes." Look what happened to Congressman Hansen. Congressman Hansen is a great example. Pay your taxes, but you know what? Shut down the Federal Reserve System, and eventually, you won't have to pay those taxes anymore. See, the IRS is a symptom of the problem. The real problem is the banking industry and the bankers in this country. That's where the real problem lies, that's the root of our problem. That's why we've lost America, okay? So yeah, pay your taxes, because if you don't pay them, you make it hurt. And I've heard all the arguments, you know. How tax protesters say, and so on, and so forth. And I don't call them tax protestors, I call them the Tax Honesty Movement, cause they are being honest at least. But the fact of the matter is you're being forced, you're being compelled to pay it, because you're facing jail sentences, you're facing time, you're facing corruption of the courts if you don't pay, right? And so you pay it, just like you'd pay the mafia. With the mafia, at least, you have the government to call on try and help you to get past the mafia, to protect you. Here you have nobody to protect you. The American people are living in a Matrix. They don't understand the truth of how things are working in this country. And let me give an example of what I'm talking about. The very fact is that if you ask 100 people on the street: "What kind of government is America supposed to be?" 99% of them will tell you "a democracy." "America is supposed to be a democracy." But that's a lie, that's an illusion. The word "democracy" is not written into the Constitution one time, it's not in the Bill of Rights, it's not in the Declaration of Independence. The Founding Fathers hated the idea of a democracy. They thought it was the worst form of government there is. And I agree with them, cause in a democracy, 51% of the people control 49% of the people. If you are part of the 49%, you are not free. America was founded as a constitutional republic. And in that constitutional republic that we have, 99% of the people can't take away the rights of 1%. You have your rights, cause you are born with them. You have God-given human rights that nobody can take away from you - the government, the majority, no matter who they are. I can't take away your rights. And that's what our Founding Fathers gave us. But the psychological operations that they do to us, they make us believe that we are a democracy, and that majority rules, you see? And they want you to believe that, cause then they tell you: "This pole says: this many want this, and this many want that, and this many want this," - it doesn't have anything to do with anything! Well, Hitler was elected. Hitler was elected, Hitler did everything legally. And in a constitutional republic, a minority is protected against the majority. Was it Benjamin Franklin paraphrased that said: "Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner"? Exactly! And then he also said: "In a republic, the sheep would have a gun." To protect himself. And that's the truth. America is not a democracy. But you ask those intelligent people what form of government America is supposed to be, they'll say "a democracy", cause that's what they've been brainwashed, they've been psy-opped into believing that. They believe that we're in Iraq to promote democracy. The word "democracy"... You hear George Bush saying: "Democracy, it means freedom." No. Democracy equals New World Order. Democracy equals slavery. The word "democracy" is not synonymous with freedom, it's the opposite of freedom. Democracy is the worst form of government you can have, cause it's a majority rule. And the government can tell you exactly what they want to tell you to do, cause the majority wants it. I don't care what the majority wants! I live my life as I choose. And if I don't commit violence, theft or fraud against another human being, I can live my life as I wish. That's my choice. And I'm allowed to make mistakes. Cause when you make mistakes, you learn from them. You grow as human being. We are put on this Earth to become the best individuals we can be, to fulfill our God-given potential, right? We are not here so the government can tell us how to live our lives and what we must do, we're put into these systems and these paradigms. No! The same thing in health. You know, "if you are sick, you have to have a certain protocol." Nonsense! Be individuals, think for yourself, have critical thinking. And so what's happened is that because they've taught everybody that we are a democracy, which is not true, in 1913 they bring the Federal Reserve System into being. And now they had this Federal Reserve System, which in 1913 got their right to create money for the government. When before that, the government created its own money. Now the government, when it needed money, had to borrow it from this private bank called the Federal Reserve. Which is a private bank, owned by individuals, incorporated in Delaware. What happens is now the government borrows money from them to fund the government. Then the government says: "Well, we have to pay these people interest. How are we gonna pay them interest? Let's impose a tax on the labor of the American people, which never existed before, to pay the interest to the bankers." In fact, in 1980, Ronald Reagan said: "Not one red cent of your income tax money goes to run the country, all goes to the Federal Reserve." -Well, it was the Grace Commission Report that said that not one nickel goes to the infrastructure of the country. But the point I'm trying to make is that by creating this Federal Reserve System, the government now became dependent on these private banks for money, and they started taxing us, you see. Now what happens is that in '35, I believe, it was, social security started. They gave social security cards, said: "Not to be used for identification." The social security number right on the card. And through social security, they started deducting money out of your paycheck. Now was the first time they were ever to take money out of your paycheck. People agreed to, cause they thought it was going to the retirement fund. So then, when they instituted the income tax again, they started taking money out of your paycheck, cause social security could do it. So then they could do it again. You see what I'm saying? So now they've even taken control over tax, the tax payment itself - like you're a slave, they're taking it right there when you make it. -Exactly! -They don't even trust the public enough to go and do it themselves. -To send them a check, right. So they take it out automatically, cause they know people aren't gonna want to pay it. So what's happened is that through the implementation of the Federal Reserve System, the government has become vest in these bankers, and they get their money from the bankers. Then they impose a tax on us, which makes us more slaves, makes it more difficult for us to survive, right? And giving them more profits. Now what's happened is that through the Federal Reserve System, the bankers have pretty much taken control of our government. It doesn't matter Republican or Democrat anymore, cause they're both the same. Neither one of them are talking about shutting down the Federal Reserve System or stopping to pay them their taxes. Or any of the big issues that face Americans. I had a friend, Nick Rockefeller, who was one of the Rockefeller family. When I was running for governor in Nevada, he came to me, introduced himself to me through an attorney, and we became friends, we started talking about things. I learned an awful lot from Mr. Rockefeller. One of the things that we used to talk about was the ultimate plan of the banking industry, what they wanted to accomplish. And the goals of the banking industry, not just the Federal Reserve System, but the private banks in Germany, England, Italy, all over the world - they all work together. They are all central banks. And they were a part of the Communist Manifesto. Central banking is one of the major planks of the Communist Manifesto. We talk about America being a capitalistic country, but yet, at the same time, we have a central bank that plans everything for us. And the graduated income tax is another plank of the Communist Manifesto. So right there you have two major planks of the Communist Manifesto. They've been brought in because of the Federal Reserve System. The ultimate goal that these people have in mind is the goal to create a one World Government run by the banking industry, run by the bankers. And they are doing it in sections. The European currency, the euro, and the European Constitution is one part of it. Now they're trying to do it in America with the North American Union. And they want to create a new currency called the amero. The whole agenda is to create a one World Government where everybody has an RFID chip implanted in them. All money is to be in those chips. There'll be no more cash. And this is given me straight from Rockefeller himself, this is what they want to accomplish. And all money will be in your chips. Instead of having cash, anytime you have money in your chip, they can take out whatever they want to take out whenever they want to. If they say you owe us this much money in taxes, they just deduct it out of your chip digitally. -Total control. -Total control. And if you're like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just turn off your chip, and you have nothing, you can't buy food, you can't do anything. It's total control of the people! And that chip's connected to a database that has your purchasing records, what you do, what you sell. -Everything! Everything is in there! So they want a one World Government controlled by them, everybody being chipped, all the money in those chips, and they control the chips, they control people. And you become a slave, you become a serf to these people. That's their goal, that's their intentions. More than a decade ago, I began getting secret government documents - and we published them - where the feds were training the local police and the military that gun owners, conservatives, people that made frequent references to the US Constitution "were terrorists" (that's a quote). But in 2009, it broke into national media when we received the secret MIAC report from a state police officer, and that was the state of Missouri, but the feds had written it, demonizing Ron Paul, people that wanted to end the Federal Reserve, people that wanted liberty and freedom. And now more secret reports have been released, like the Department of Homeland Security report, which the feds admit they wrote, that says returning veterans are the number one terror threat in America, that gun owners are part of that number one threat, the people buying ammo are the number one threat. Think about this! These private bankers overthrowing the United States, and they're secretly training the police that gun owners and patriots and veterans are the number one threat. So they're saying the American people that follow the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, that will actually stand up against this tyranny, are terrorists. Because THEY are the terrorists, THEY are the criminals coming in with the corporate takeover hijacking of the nation. Aaron, can you be specific about when you met Rockefeller, how it happened in these discussions? I met Rockefeller through a female attorney I knew who called me up one day and said: "One of the Rockefellers would like to meet you." I had made a video called Mad as Hell, and he'd seen the video and wanted to meet me. He knew I was running for governor in Nevada. So sure I'd love to meet him. And I met him, and I liked him, and he was a very, very smart man. We used to talk and share ideas and thoughts. He's the one who told me 11 months before 9/11 ever happened that there was going to be an event - never told what the event was gonna be. But there was gonna be an event, and out of that event we are gonna invade Afghanistan to run pipelines from the Caspian Sea, we're gonna invade Iraq to take over the oil-fields, establish a base in the Middle East and make it all a part of the New World Order. And we go after Chavez in Venezuela. Sure enough, later, 9/11 happened, and I remembered he was telling me how how we gonna see soldiers looking in caves for people in Afghanistan and Pakistan and all these places. And there's gonna be this War on Terror, of which there's no real enemy, and the whole thing is a giant hoax, you know. But it's a way for the government to take over the American people. He told you it was gonna be a hoax? -Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! There's no question! He says, "There's gonna be War on Terror," and he's laughing. There's no... Who are we fighting? I mean, why do you think 9/11 happened, and then nothing's happened since then? Do you think that our security is so great here that these people who pulled off 9/11, who were able..., can't knock down another plane? Come on! It's ridiculous! 9/11 was done by people in our own government, our own banking system, to perpetuate the fear of the American people into subordinating themselves into anything the government wants them to do. That what it's about. And to create this endless War on Terror. That was the first lie. The next lie was to go into Iraq to get Saddam Hussein out with his weapons of mass destruction. That was the next lie. -Now specifically, this was a little over 6 years ago? -This was... -11 months before 9/11? -Yeah. And Nick Rockefeller, he's a lawyer, he is kind of your friend over the previous years, and he's saying to you that there's gonna be this big event, and that out of that we're gonna have a War on Terror that just gonna go on and on? -Right. An endless War on Terror without any real enemy. So you can never define a winner. And did he say that it's gonna be perfect, cause you can't define enemy, it just goes on and on? -Yeah, cause you can't define a winner. There's no one whom we're going to beat, so it goes on and on forever. And they can do whatever they want. They scare the hell out of the American public. Look! This whole War on Terror is a fraud! It's a farce! It's very difficult to say it out loud, cause people are intimidated against saying it. Because if you say it, they wanna make you into a nutcase. But the truth has to be, the truth has to come out. That's why I'm doing this interview. The fact of the matter happens to be that the whole War on Terror is a fraud, it's a farce. Yeah, there's a war going on in Iraq, cause we invaded Iraq, and people are over there fighting. But the War on Terror - it's a joke! And until we discover what really happened on 9/11 and who was responsible for 9/11, cause that's where the War on Terror emanates from, that's where it comes from. It was 9/11 that allowed this War on Terror to begin. And until we get to the bottom root of 9/11, the truth of 9/11, we'll never know about the War on Terror. -Aaron, you said that he was, and I think it's important, and I know this about the Rockefellers. You'll be 20 years old in a launch line out of college, and moves in a Rockefeller to recruit me. They're experts at recruiting and getting what they call "players," and clearly he was... I wanna make it specific and just get you to reiterate what you said last night about you got 30% of the vote, you were having an effect, you've made Mad as Hell, they knew that you'd started the Constitution Party. They knew that you were somebody who was taking action and getting things done. You've already made some big films, had lot of other successes. -Right. So they were trying to recruit you. And didn't it come down to the point of "Hey, we are here to recruit you, and don't worry, your chip is gonna say: 'Don't mess with us. This guy is Don't Touch'"? Yes, that did happen. I was definitely being recruited. -But it's more subtle than that. -Just go through the process. Well, what it is... Remember we were friends, and we used to go to my house a lot, we had dinner, we talked. And he'd tell me about business investments I'd get involved in. Or they would help me with this business investment or that business investment. And was I interested in joining the Council on Foreign Relations? I would have to get a letter to join them. Was I interested in that? And, you know, just ...stuff. Leading you on. And I used to say to him I never really did that, because that was where I was coming from. "As much as I like you, Nick, your ways and my ways were on the opposite side of the fence. I don't believe in enslaving people." And he would come back: "With all I do? It's better for them." It was more like... How do I put it? It was like: "What do you care about them? What do you care about those people? What difference does it make to you? Take care of your own life. Do the best you can for you and your family. What does the rest of the people mean to you? They don't mean anything to you. They're just serfs, they're just people." It was just a lack of caring. And that's just not who I was. It was just sort of like cold. It was just like cold. I used to say to him: "What's the point of all this? You have all the money in the world you need. You have all the power you need. What's the point? What's the end goal?" And he said: "The end goal is to get everybody chipped to control the whole society. To have the bankers, the elite people - the bankers and some governors - controlling the world." And I said: "Do all the people in the Council on Foreign Relations wanna do what you do?" No, no, no! Most of them believe they're doing the right thing. A lot of them believe it's better off being socialistic. We have to convince people that socialism is really capitalism. Cause America's becoming a socialist country, it's a communist country today. And here we are years later after Aaron Russo points out this is not a capitalist or free market country, but it's really socialist. In fact, here's the cover of Newsweek: "We are all socialists now." But this isn't the socialism the public thinks it is where the government robs from the rich to give to the poor. Actually, it's always the big banks, the elites throughout history that fund socialism. They wanna use the middle class's money to basically domesticate the working class and expand the size of government, so they can basically in the endgame eradicate the middle class and have a giant submass of uneducated slaves who have no chance of ever rebelling against the tyranny, and a tiny elite in control of it all. And that is the very nature of this New World Order system. They are using Big Government to strangle competition, to take control of the people, to break up the family. To basically set up a global plantation, or neofeudalist state. One of the things he told me was... We were at the house one night, we were talking, and he started laughing and said: "Aaron, what do you think Women's Liberation was about?" I said... I had pretty conventional thinking about that at that point. I said the things about women having the right to work getting equal pay with men, just like having the right to vote. And he started to laugh and said: "You're an idiot." And I said: "Why am I an idiot?" He said: "Let me tell you what that was about. We the Rockefellers funded that, we funded Women's Lib, you know. And we're the ones who got all over the newspapers and television - the Rockefeller Foundation." He says: "You wanna know why?" He said there were two primary reasons. And they were - one reason was: we couldn't tax half of the population before Women's Lib. And the second reason was: now we get the kids in school at an early age, we can indoctrinate the kids how to think, cause this breaks up their family. The kids start looking at the State as the family, at the school, at the officials as their family, not as the parents teaching them. Those are the two primary reasons for Women's Lib, which, I thought up to that point, was a noble thing. When I saw their intentions behind it, where they were coming from when they created it, the thought of it - I saw the evil behind what I thought was a noble venture. Aaron, did you know that Gloria Steinem in one of her own books now admits the CIA funded Ms. Magazine? No, I had no idea about that. No, I never heard that. -CIA funded Ms. Magazine? -Funded Ms. Magazine with the stated goal of taxing women and breaking up the family. No kidding? I never heard that. Well, Nick told me. I mean, I know it, but not because I know the CIA was involved in it. Gloria Steinem was proud of it. All the CIA wanted was to "help me help women". -No kidding? -So they funded it. Yeah. -And of course, it's divide and conquer. -Right! Of course! What they do is they focus in obviously on real problems: women were getting shafted in many ways. But the elite didn't want to help them, they were planning to really shaft them and take men away from them. Look at what they did with black families. We only had about 10% illegitimacy 50 years ago in black communities, and now it's over 90%. And look at welfare. "We are gonna give you some money, but you can't have a man in the house." -Right. -So that was further to degrade the family. Totally destroyed, and now illegitimacies over 50% in the general population. Right. Well, you see, the whole thing is these people control the money, so they make all the rules. And they put every rule they want into a fact. And the truth is America has really become a socialist, communistic country. Everybody says it's a capitalistic country. It's not a capitalistic country. How can it be capitalistic when you have a central bank? It can't be! -It's a planned economy! -It's a planned economy, it's a phoney! If they want to create prosperity, they just print dollars, they just make dollars or put digits into the economy. And now you have prosperity. You don't have real prosperity, you don't have real manufacturing. You just have money being injected in, it's an infusion of credit. -Which only makes the government go into more debt. -Into more debt. The Federal Reserve is poison to our country. Of course, it is. It's poison. "Whoever makes the money, makes the rules." Rothschild said that. And they make the money. Why we allow these private bankers to make the money for our country? It makes no sense! Why are we paying interest to these banks to make money for us when the government can do it itself without paying interest and without all that debt? There's no answer to that question. And that's the question no politician will raise. Everybody talks about America's debt, how much debt we're in. We're in debt, because we have to borrow money. -But we don't have to borrow money. -They designed it so we go into debt. Exactly! We can create the money and back it by gold, so they can't create too much of it. So you don't have the inflation. And do what the Founding Fathers gave us. But instead, the bankers make the money, they control the government, they buy the politicians, they tell us who gets into office. You have computer voting, that's a fraud. They do whatever they wanna do to us. They do whatever they wanna do to us. And that has to stop. My friendship with Nick Rockefeller was one way we expressed ideas to each other and thoughts and philosophies. And he wanted me to become part of what they were doing, and for me to become a member of the CFR, and offered various business opportunities for me to get involved in,
