Let me go! No... Don't! Help! Let her go! Help! Save me! Look out! Royston! Are you alright? Get me down! Done? What was that? What? Cough it out... cough! Okay, stand up... Come on, cough it out, come on! Cough it out! One more time, come on! Come on! Come on! Cough it out, come on! Why are you eating pencils? It's for writing, you know? Remember? Hao Ren! What are you doing? I'm... What is this? Not funny! I've already told you not to help your mum buy such stuff! You simply refused to listen. Look, everyone's laughing at you now. Is this your mum's? Is it? Okay, back to your test! And stop bringing your mother's bra or your father's bra to school! Hey, this one's for you! Wh... Why? You think it's too little? I don't usually give treats to others, okay? No... it's not that... I'm glad that's not what you meant. Anyway, if you need anything in future, look for me! I can get you any kind of bras regardless of size A, B, C, D, or E, they're all of top quality! I don't... Why are you hesitating? You don't need to feel embarrassed about this. I'm very open-minded. Just be yourself, love yourself, bae. - Come, let's eat. - Hello. Hao Ren, I want my refund! What refund? You promised to give me the answers at S$10 per question. You took S$50 from me yet you only gave me four answers! I want my refund! Don't act oblivious. There were five answers altogether. Oh, please! You drew an apple and I could tell it represents "A". Then, you drew the letter "M". What the hell is an "M"? Excuse me! I drew a bird. "B" for "Bird". Who the heck will understand that! You're a noob if you can't even understand that. I risked my life to give you those answers. You should give me a reward for that. Yet you still want a refund? You must be out of your mind! Are you trying to bargain with me? What do you think this is? A fish market? Please don't speak so loudly, you'll scare me. And when I'm scared, I shoot my mouth off. If "Boo Dog" gets to learn about this... You promised you'd keep it a secret. Hello, we all heard because you two were talking so loudly. Okay? Violet said that her post could garner 2,000 likes within 24 hours! Three words. That is not possible! Exactly! "That is not possible"... that's four words! Violet's posts have always been viral. Exactly. Violet's posts have always been viral! You're just like a parrot. You should move and stay in Jurong Bird Park! Wanna bet? I'm not interested in betting, but I do have an idea that can garner 20,000 likes! Pose nude? You're disgusting! S$20 for my idea! Wanna buy? She's so rich, even S$200 per idea is peanuts to her. Guys... I'm serious. If I pose nude, will I get 2,000 likes? This is our school's male toilet. Stinky to the max! Yucks! Oh my God... That is so disgusting! That's gonna give me nightmares for the next three years! Trust me! This is not the best place you wanna be. So, this is my virgin tour to the boys' toilet, bye! Bro! Why are you so late? Punished by the tutor again? Bro, guess who am I? Can't you tell? I'm Naruto! You're so lousy! Did you secretly use my hair gel again? I used glue! Bro, can you help me sign for Mum? I'm afraid Mum will kill me. Wow! 29 out of 30? No! Bro, wait for me! Bro, can you buy glue for me? I've finished mine and Mum might scold me for that. If Mum sees you like this, she will scold me instead for sure! This is for you, Madam Chen. Thank you. Miss, I heard that you were great at designing clothes. No, I'm not. The whole clinic says so. My mum used to be a fashion designer and she had her own boutique at Orchard Road! - Oh, is that your younger son? - Yes. So cute! - That must be the older one? - Yup. He's my older brother and he's very smart. He tops his class every year! Wow! You have a pair of great kids! Oh, you're too kind. He's going to be a doctor in future so he has to study hard. That's true. Bro, speak up! Tell Mum that you don't want to be a doctor. Mummy, Bro doesn't want to be a doctor. That's right! I don't want to be a doctor! Be it neurology, paediatrics, gynaecology, ophthalmology orthopedics, oncology, cardiology, neurosurgery I don't want any of it! I want to look good and help others look good! I want to be a fashion designer and create my own label in Japan! My very own label! Thank you! Are you crazy? Why did you hit me? Why did you hit me? Mum's talking to you. Nonsense! Your brother's biggest dream is to be a doctor! Right? Japan! Department. "D" for "Department". Is there an "I" in "Department"? Why are you so dumb? There's an "I" in everything now! iPhone, iPad, iMac... there's an "I" in "everything". There's an "I" in "die" as well. You want to die? Both of you came from the same womb but why is one so smart and the other so dumb? What now? Do you think your pouting is adorable? I'm telling you, we're under immense pressure living in Singapore. If you don't have a degree, what will become of you? Your brother will become a doctor in future! Tell me, what are you going to do? Are you going to be a road sweeper or a garbage collector? Mummy, you're outdated. We have foreign workers sweeping our roads and collecting our garbage. Singaporeans have no opportunity to do such jobs! No one can beat you when it comes to talking back. You'll be the death of me! I'm telling you, you should study hard! You have no idea how fortunate you are! During my era, no one was as lucky as you! "You should study hard! You have no idea how fortunate you are! During my era, no one was as lucky as you!" You don't have to study. How lucky! Royston, thanks for this great piece! How much does it cost? It's free of charge this time. Just take it as a loan from me. Oh my god! You're so kind! Thanks! I was thinking since your skills are so refined why don't you try cosplaying yourself? Me? Look at me, how can I possibly do it? My brother, don't keep putting yourself down. Like the legendary Shinwa... Let me tell you, many skilled cosplayers make their own costumes! I know but, how can I compare to Shinwa? I get the jitters when I have to face too many people. Moreover, I don't want to be famous. Brother, you're too modest! You think you're not famous enough? Don't you know that you're super famous now? What are you talking about? Stop pretending! Go to "You-Too-Ball"! "You-Too-Ball"? YouTube! - Oh, you mean YouTube. - What's so great about English? Type it in, and search for "Pee Man". - P-E-E-M-A-N. "Pee Man." - P-E-E-M-A-N. I bet you'll feel terrible after watching it. This is our school's male toilet... Stinky to the max! Yucks! Oh my God... That is so disgusting! That's gonna give me nightmares for the next three years! Hey. Look who's here! It's "Pee Man"! "Pee Man"! You still wet your pants at this age? You can't hold it in? I think you should wear diapers! Hey, where are you going? Going to p... pee? Hey, let's see if you can aim properly! Royston, get lost! You guys asked for "Pee Man", right? I'm going to give it to you! What is going on? And that's all for today, folks. "Pee Man Part 2"! I hope you en... - ...joy. - ...joy. What are you staring at? I'm going to charge you for that! You youngsters nowadays are so self-centred. You don't know how to spare a thought for others. What gave you the right to expose Royston in that manner? Unbelievable. Look. What you eat, when you sleep... When you bathe? Do you really need to share these with strangers out there? I don't find there's anything wrong. Everyone's doing it. So, if everyone jumps off the building you'll also jump? You are seeking attention, but you will get the wrong kind. Pictures like these will attract perverts! I won't take any action this time. But if you do it again, I will have to talk to your parents. They won't be free for you. Next time, if you take a video of someone ask their permission. Go back to class! Whatever... "Boo Dog". Uncool! Don't you walk away, you little devil! You'd better not come any nearer or I'll take a photo of you! Aren't you sick of taking photos? You dragged Royston into this mess! I didn't do it on purpose. Royston, give her a piece of your mind! I'll do it for you! Just pay me S$10! You really have nothing better to do. You post everything online. It's fine that you post things about yourself. How could you post a video of Royston peeing? Have you ever pictured yourself in Royston's shoes? I didn't take a picture! I took a video, okay? You're so lame! Sorry. I-It's okay, n-no worries. You may be gracious, but I'm not. You owe me S$10. Bad Guy, what about that thing you owe me? What was that? My iPad! You said you'd borrow it for a few days, but where is it now? Well... This is so fun. So many colours! Drop that, Grandma! That's not mine! Right! It's all Steve's fault. The shockproof function was not well designed! I want you to compensate! Little dev... Mighty Princess Violet why would you care about such a small sum of money? You're right. It's peanuts to me, but you still need to pay for it! Don't tell me you want my... Oh my God, you're so disgusting! How do you want me to pay? I want you to complete three missions! What are they? Well... I don't have an idea yet! I'll let you know when I have something in mind, bye! Bye. Hurry up! Go get it! What do you keep forgetting? Hurry up! I told you we can't do it in my house I'm dead if my mum finds out. I need it now, my brother! Once my roommate moves out, we can do it in my room. Stop fidgeting! Why are you rushing into it? Relax! Don't blame me if I hurt you. Don't worry about the pain. I love it tight! Royston, what are you doing in the room? - I thought your mum left? - Royston, why are you not answering? - Who's inside? - I... G-Give me a minute! I-I'm changing! Royston, why did you lock your door? - Who's inside? - Wait! Open the door, Royston! What the hell are you doing? Jordan, go get the spare key from the store room. - Royston, who's inside? - Which part of the store room? The first drawer in the store room! Go now! Royston, open the door now! The first drawer from the top or the bottom? The first drawer from the bottom! Why are you so dumb? Okay, coming... I'm coming! Who is he? Mum, he's... my friend, Chen Jun. Hello, Auntie. You're so pretty! My name's Chen Jun. C-H-E-N, J-U-N. Hailing from Beijing, China. - Mum... we'll make a move! Bye. - And I'm over 20 this year. Bye, Auntie! Bye! Mummy, he's wearing lipstick. I saw that too. Uncle, Stadium Place. Oh yes! Wait! Sorry. As we're in a hurry please drive fast but steady, and take note of traffic rules. Don't use your mobile when you're driving, okay? Let's go! S$19.80, please. Here you go, Uncle. Stop staring, where's my change? - Go. - Keep the change! Stop pushing me, what's the hurry? - My dress is riding up! - Thank you. - Thanks, Uncle! What's with you? - Thank you! Bye! Stop doing that. Everyone's looking. They can look all they want! That's the whole point of cosplay. When will you start cosplaying too? I've told you before. I can't do it. I-I'm not used to others looking at me I think I'd better stick to making costumes. Wow! Never belittle cosplay. There are many hidden talents here! Wow! What do you think? He's too cool... for his friends. You're so tactless! Don't judge him by the book he's actually a pilot. Really? Don't you think she looks charismatic and graceful? She's a reputable lawyer. Stylish, right? He's a renowned engineer in Singapore. Chen Jun! Thanks! I know... he's so good-looking he must be a fashion designer. No. He's an interior designer, right? Oh please, can you have just a little more imagination? That dude's a chef! Money's hard to earn! Three missions. Damn! Lousy missions! Well, you're the "Dirty Job Warrior". "Dirty Job Warrior." These clothes are for Orange and the girls, not for me. Bad Guy, I'll buy them for you if you wear a skirt! My clothes are really expensive. Right, Orange? Of course! Don't you know that Violet's super rich? My God! How much longer do you girls want to shop? Look! Isn't she that babe from YouTube? - Yup! - Oh my! Orange, do you want to go to the toilet? You go ahead! Hey! There are many cosplayers downstairs! Let's take a look! One, two, three. - Thanks! - You're welcome. Dude, where are you going? I'm delivering these costumes to my customer. Oh, looks like someone's business is booming! - Thank you. - Thank you. Royston! There're some issues with the costume you made. What's wrong? Can't you see it? Right here. Are you blind? Hey, Violet Ong! Where are you going? Let's be friends! Your cup size doesn't look very big. - At most 32B. - But you're still hot! Especially in that white tube. Where are you going... Babe... don't walk away like that! Let's be friends. - We can exchange numbers! - Get lost! Where are you going? - Let's be friends. - Get lost! - I'll take a video of you. - You think I look like Chow Yun Fat? Go ahead... You are a YouTuber, right? I can be the male lead in your videos! - Get lost! - What's wrong? My favourite colour's violet too! - Take a video of me, go ahead! - I'll take a video of you now! Get lost! Taking a photo of you now! Go on, you can take it! You scumbag! Get lost! Idiots! I'll kill you! You bastards who pick on women! I'll stab your XX eyes out stab your XX noses out and stab your XX mouths I'll burn you in hell for 7.8 million years till you become charcoal! Let's get out of here! Thank you. One, two, three, thank you! Thank you... Hi, may I take a photo with you? - Of course! - Thanks! One, two, three. Can I have your number? Of course... 99923456. What? You're a guy? Affirmative. Plus, double confirmation. Certified with a three-year warranty. Hey, where are they? No idea, I'm looking for them too. My dear son, do you see this sausage here? Yes. Since I've conceived... fried a sausage It'll never become an egg. What? My dear sausage, it's your karma to be a sausage you must strive to be a good one. Don't ever dream of becoming an egg. Do you get what I mean? Mum, there's something I think you should know. I prefer eggs! Thank you! Knock before you enter. Bro, guess who I am. Jordan Chio. I'm Crayon Shin-chan! Am I cute? I'm cosplaying him. Am I cute? You call this cosplay? Wow, Bro, look! Hey, I want to look at that! Hey... you're making a mess all over me! Get down... Take this! Get out! Now! Brat! Mum, are you snooping on Bro's computer again? - Whoa! - Why are you so shocked? What's wrong with you? Are you sick? Come here, wipe it off now! Bro! Shhh... not so loud! Shh. Now, now. Mummy, please don't kill me... Nonsense! Why would I kill you? In the manga world everybody gets killed when they know a secret. Why are you so dumb? Nobody's going to kill you! Why were you snooping on Bro's Facebook page? Come here and take a look at this. Look at your brother's Facebook. He has practically no friends! Mum's got more friends than him! I just want to help him. Look! Not even a single like. And there are only a few pathetic posts! You won't see much if Bro's not granting you access. Why are you so dumb? How dare you! Call your mum dumb? You... Okay... let's make a deal. Tell Mummy how I can see your brother's posts. Only middle-aged people use Facebook now. - Do you know why? - Why? All of you are tracking us so we turn to other alternatives! Oh... which ones? I'm the Mighty Action Hero. What's in it for me if I let you know? Pew! Pew! Orange, why did you say I'm a show-off? A show-off? I don't know what you're talking about. You said that I'm a show-off on Instagram! Instagram? How is that possible? I saw it with my own eyes! You saw it? But I thought I blocked you. Hey! Why did you block me? Don't you think that you're very bitchy? You think I'm bitchy? How can I compare to you? Who's always criticising others saying he's lousy or she's a loser? I thought you always agreed with what I said? I thought we were BFFs? Ew... Who would want a bitch as her BFF? I've always shared the best with you! Exactly! I'm only friends with you because of that. Why do you think I can put up with your princess syndrome? - You... - Don't touch me! At the end of the day you just want everyone to know that you're rich and beautiful. I've never said that... Forget it, Violet! You're just an attention-seeker who wants everyone to idolise you. Sorry, not me! I can't even stand the sight of you! Why did she do this to me? I shared everything with her. I regarded her as my best friend yet she did it to me. I remembered she lost her phone once and couldn't stop crying. I helped her search for it for two hours and bought her a new phone in the end. She claimed that I was an attention-seeker who liked to show off... Don't cry, my baby. Hey. Are you going to give that to me? Oh... Do you have more? N-No... - Nope... - You don't have more? Just go. Hey! Look! Tell me now! Don't waste my time. Is this you? No? N-N-No! Oh, that's... that's such a pity! Do you know what Violet said? She said, "Oh, my..." "Oh, my God! Cosplay is so cool! I wish Royston was the hero who saved me! He's so macho! My hero! My saviour! My idol! Oh my God!" If you tell me the truth I'll teach you how to woo Violet. Really? As long as you admit that you're Krazer - I will... - Yes. Are you a sissy? Speak louder! Yes, I am! Who are you? I'm Krazer! Idiots! Is that really him? Of course! Change into this quickly. I'll take you somewhere! Where? It's a surprise. Idiots! I'll kill you! Wow! What is this? Oh, this is the fashion brand I created. One day, I'll make it a reality and... And? And design a dress just for you. What did you say? - He said he likes... - Hey! I mean, I-I want to design a dress just for you. Mission Two accomplished! Let's go! Hao Ren, what are you doing? Wow, these costumes cost a bomb! I didn't know cosplaying was so expensive. It's not that expensive. I saved to buy materials for these costumes. My dream is to go to Japan and showcase my designs on the runway. Oh my God, you're so awesome! But why do people cosplay? Cosplayers get to become their favourite characters and live out their fantasies in reality. It's really fun. Are there many people attending such events? The number of cosplayers ranges from tens to hundreds. Sometimes, it can even go up to thousands or more! Thousands or more? That's it! I want to cosplay too! You? Forget it! Hey, what do you mean by that? Well... cosplay requires commitment. I'm committed! Once I post my cosplay photos onto Facebook, Twitter, Instagram the more likes I get, the more commitment I have! Excuse me, do you think it's easy? A lot of time is needed to make costumes and props! Time is money! Exactly, time is money that's why I'm using free labour. Your final mission is to help me with my costume and cosplay with me! I get to decide your cosplay character... "Dirty Job Warrior"! Save me! Don't worry, I'll help you. Oh my God... really? Awesome! You'll be my costume designer and I'll be your model! Deal? - Yes! - Wow! What are you howling about? Asia Cosplay Summit Most Likes Contest? Most Likes? This contest requires participants to post a cosplay video online. The person with the most likes wins S$1,000! Yeah, whatever! As long as it makes me more popular I'm fine with cosplaying any character. Do you want to join us? - Me? - Oh, please. His legs give way whenever he's nervous. I'll chop my head off if he agrees! Do you like me... to cosplay with you? I'd love that. Is that a yes? Do you have a knife with you? No... but I've got a pair of scissors. Someone said he'd chop his head off if you agreed to cosplay. - Help, she's going to kill me. - Stop right there! Help! - Please... - Shhh! Shhh! I need to... I-I... need to... Oh, if you mind, don't worry. I can just estimate your size. No, it has to be precise! If the costume is baggy here and loose there, it won't fit at all. Go ahead! I want to be the most beautiful character so that my followers will go crazy over me! I'm gonna wear this so my dad won't recognise me! - Stop messing with my prop! - Hey guys, stop fooling around! Hey! Wow! It's such a hot day! It's raining. Yes, quite heavily. Hello? Katana? S-So sorry. I don't have the time to make costumes for you recently. Hey, what are you doing? Let's check out Royston's photos! You're so evil! Do you know his password? It's either your name or your birth date. Why? What do you think? Violet Ong. Lousy! iloveviolet. Oh my God, you're so disgusting! Jackpot! H-How... much is this? S$12.50 per metre. Wow! That's expensive! Boss, it's only S$10 next door. You should go next door then! Don't worry about the money. What's going on? They're bargaining. Miss, how is this possible? You've become so much prettier and slimmer! Do I know you? I come here often with my dad. He's that short and plump tailor. He'd always tell my mum how beautiful you are and ask her to get beauty tips from you. My mum got so jealous and scolded him! Really? Of course! He still insists that I come here even though my mum doesn't like it. Why is that so? He's been everywhere. Only the lady boss here is beautiful and kind! Where else can we go? What a sweet boy! Just tell me what you want! - Five metres. - Dear! Get five metres for them at S$8, okay? Dude, money's hard to earn! You have to open your mouth to bargain. Since we have good looks we should buy things from middle-aged women. The older and uglier, the better deals we get. Wow, Bad Guy! You have such a glib tongue. I admire guys who are confident and eloquent. Here's a like for you! I've done my research. Confidence and attitude are vital to cosplay. As long as we believe in ourselves nothing will get in our way! Roy... Royston? Why is the door locked? Open the door. Drink this... Oh, dear! What's wrong with your eye? My eye? Did you get panda eyes from studying late? - Do you need my eye cream? - No, thanks! - Hold on. Have some chicken essence. - Okay. You really don't need my eye cream? You're not done yet. Drink up, there's still a little left. Finish it. Son, are you alright? Okay... study hard. Okay? Are you guys here yet? Hey, walk faster. Royston's rushing us! What's the hurry? You little devil... Wow! - Wow! - Look at the crowd! Do you want to win $1,000? Yes, of course! We must take action now! Can you speak in human language, please? In order to attract everybody's attention we need an audience! Look at all these people here! What are you waiting for? Take off your cloak now! Hello, no one even looked at us. Epic fail! No worries, I've got a secret weapon. We have props, haven't we? What is this for? What do you know? I need gimmicks to get eyeballs! Hold this! Oh my God, this is a real sword! Of course. This is my mad's prized antique. Many died under its blade. I want everybody to know that my cosplay is the real deal! - Be careful! - I'll be fine! Watch out! Hello! Oh, dear. The competition's starting soon. Why are your friends not here yet? Dude, I'll be going on stage soon or else I won't be able to upload my video on time. Good luck! Hello, where are you? I thought I told you guys to come earlier? What? Arrested by security? Okay... I'm coming over now, wait for me! Is this why you couldn't make our costumes? Trying to be like us? You really think we can't survive without you? S-Sorry, I've got to go. Something urgent came up. I bet you know you look like a loser so you're trying to back out now? Fear not. He's a sorry sight. We look even more fantastic because of losers like him! Please excuse me, I really need to leave now. No way! What are you going to do about it? Losers like you are not fit to carry such weapons! - Give it to me! - Stop it! Give it back to me! Stop right there! Do I look like your toy? Am I your dog? I've been tolerating your nonsense for a long time. Who do you think you are? You think you're so cool just because you posed in costumes? Get this! You're just worthless fools without my costumes! Huh? So cool! Why were you taken away by security? It's all her fault! Why are you blaming me? You attention-seeker! You wanted more people to look at you. Well, you could have stopped me but you didn't. You were holding a real sword. What if you cut me into two pieces? You didn't stop me because of the prize money! Enough! Are both of you crazy? We don't use real weapons when we cosplay! Why do we need to make props if real weapons can be used? It's my first time cosplaying! I wouldn't know such things! Why are you shouting at me? Who do you think you are? My parents don't even shout at me! S-Sorry... You guys roped me into cosplaying. I didn't expect our first attempt to screw up this badly. Fine, I promise. It won't happen again. There won't be a next time. Bro, I thought we were supposed to be the Formidable Trio? It wasn't easy for me to convince myself to cosplay. In the end, I embarrassed myself completely. I will never cosplay again. Bro! Hey, look! It's all over! I'm a true blue loser. Says who? We have over 13,000 likes! You've clinched "The Most Popular Cosplayer" title! - We won! - Really? I don't care. You'll have to cosplay with me! I don't care. You'll have to split the S$1,000 with me. You're disgusting! Wow! This is just like a palace! Stop exaggerating. This house is huge. I bet you play hide-and-seek every day. No wonder you're so weird. Bad Guy! Okay, stop fooling around. Let's get started! Wow, Chen Jun! You're so good at making props! Of course! I learnt from the best. Who taught you? You won't know my teacher! By the way, I forgot to thank you guys for inviting me to join your team. Don't be so formal with us. We wouldn't have won if you didn't upload my video to the Internet. He's right. That's old news, let's move on. It was partly luck. So, for our Asia Cosplay "Xiao Mi"... Summit. "Xiao Mi". Whatever. Anyway, if we want to win Kantana in this competition, we must cut... cut them out of the competition, okay? Most of the junk that my dad brings home can be used as cosplay materials. It's pretty amazing. That's right! Cosplay brings out our creativity boosts our confidence, expands our social circle - and... - Grow our network. And that means we have more opportunities and money! - Oh, yeah! - Oh, yeah! Money grubber! Why don't we learn kung fu for our cosplay competition? Good idea! We can use multimedia to enhance our fight scenes like how they do it in anime. I can handle the graphic design. I happen to know a very famous kung fu master! I know Taichi, Shaolin Wing Chun, Hung Gar, Praying Mantis Fist, Muay Thai. Taekwando, Aikido, Judo, Kendo and Chado (the art of tea). What do you want to learn? Master, we want to learn somersault and make you our action choreographer for the competition. Sure! S$100 per hour. Grandmaster, please give us a discount. We are just poor students. No bargaining! Please. The cosplay community is very big. All you need is one recommendation post from us and you'll end up with thousands of likes. Your business will increase at least tenfold. Can we close it at S$50, please? Mr Handsome? Deal! We can start anytime! Wow! You've really changed a lot. Your negotiation skills improved tremendously! All thanks to me! Okay. All thanks to you! Hey, how can we study when you keep sighing? - He's right. - I'm trying my best but studying is really tough, I can't seem to remember anything. Not really, I concentrate better when we study together. It's too bad that your shopping buddies are only after your money. They're all not true friends. Exactly, I'm lucky to have you guys now. Royston, how do you study? I use the Association Method to remember things. I learnt that from watching anime. The Association Method? There's a method called "Memory Room." Imagine walking into a room you're familiar with. Divide the room into different sections. After that, place the things you need to remember into the different sections and link them together. For example, when I think of a window I'll link it to Bill Gates! Bookshelf, Ernest Hemingway. Computer, Steve Jobs. - Ceiling... - Enough. It sounds really complicated. Not really. It's not complicated at all. - Try it! - Okay. I'll try. Imagine walking into a room I'm familiar with. Divide the room into... What's wrong? Before I try out this method I need to first clean my room! Don't worry. As long as it's a room you're familiar with and keep practising, you'll succeed! Yes... Your turn. Do it. That hurts! I'm going to take a break. Let's do it. Royston! Shinwa left us a message. - Shinwa? - Who's Shinwa? Stop embarrassing yourself. Shinwa's a legend in the Singapore cosplay community! "Kudos to your costumes, love them! Keep it up!" How does Shinwa look like? He's very mysterious. No one knows what he looks like. He created a cosplay website to help and encourage newbies. Do you know him? Of course, I do! Wow, that's amazing. You even know a legend. I'm thirsty. Hey, introduce him to us. Every cosplayer knows Shinwa. I may know him, but he doesn't know me! Hey! You're such a noob. You're the same. Bro, guess who I am! Jordan Chio. You're not even looking at me! I'm "Hopper". Stop it! Don't let Mum see you in this or you'll turn into "Two Piece"! Don't you think I look like him? Let me join your team! - No! - Please... No! You're too young to join! Mummy always call me dumb. If I take part in the competition and win Mummy will be pleased and never call me dumb again! So cute! Oh my God, you're so cute! Oh my God, I've made up my mind. He's taking part in the competition with us! Princess Violet is awesome! No! He can't do it! Pose and I'll take a photo for you. Yes. Do I look cuter this way? Bro! Look here! What are you doing? Be careful, Jordan! Violet, not bad! Orange, not so good. Jay, you'd better have a study plan. Hao Ren, come here! Faster. Why don't you tell the whole class your marks? 6... 61! From the lowest mark record setter to 61, not bad! - Thank you. - Boo... Yes! That's right! - Mr Boo. - Don't touch me. I want to thank you for being so patient. Next, I want to thank my father, my grandma my tortoise, and my brother, Royston Chio. You are my best pal! Hey! You can go back to your seat. Bro, thanks! The Association Method really works. I knew you could do it! Of course! Thank you speech? What do you think this is? Star Awards? Are you jealous because I did better than you? You're better off studying than wasting your time staying jealous. Heard that you guys are into cosplay? Why do you do such sissy stuff? Are you guys sissies? Honestly, I think you guys have nothing better to do. And in reality, you know you are losers. So, in order to be cool you have to do this cosplay thing. Right? Who's the loser now? Be careful. Posing is really easy. Let me show you. One. Two. Three. Chen Jun, show them. Wow! So sissy! You must have confidence and attitude. Come here, Royston! What, me? Forget it... show me some attitude. Attitude. I think you'd better focus on your stunts. That's awful! No confidence, no attitude. You can't even do a somersault, what should we do? Who are they? You must be the King and Queen? I'm so honoured to meet you. These biscuits are delicious! My name is Chen Jun, C-H-E-N, J-U-N. Hailing from Beijing, China, I'm over 20 this year, I... Why did you bring this ragtag bunch of friends home? Your Highness, I'm not done yet... What do you mean? They're my classmates. Violet... Hi, Auntie! Wow, you are so beautiful. Obviously. Obviously, you've no idea how much she spends on skincare. Cool down... let's go upstairs. Hey! There's no sun here, why are you wearing sunglasses? Mr and Mrs Ong requested this meeting to sort out certain things. Hey, I don't understand English! I've foreseen they may not understand English, may I? My family's bilingual, so we can speak Chinese as well. It's Mandarin. When it's spoken, we call it Mandarin. When it's written, we call it Chinese. Your sons got my daughter into cosplay. "Crossplay", what the heck is that! It means dressing up as characters from anime or manga. Is it "crossplay" or "cross pray"? Never heard of cosplay! It means role play. Good grief! Role play? Just like what I've watched in those videos... Oh no, I meant my friend. He loves watching those videos where there are two women and a man doing this and that... Excuse me, can you show some respect? This is cosplay. This is equally serious. My daughter and your sons are of different... pedigree. Are you saying that your daughter is purebred and our sons are mongrels? Yes, something like that. Actually, Mrs Ong, prior to hanging out with Royston and Hao Ren Violet always seems a little bit unhappy. Unhappy? There is no reason for her to be unhappy because we provide her with everything possible. To be fair, Violet's attitude and results have improved tremendously. I think there is a positive influence from Royston. I beg to differ! She has improved because we've hired the best tutor in Singapore for her. I hope your son will stay away from my daughter. People of different classes simply do not mix together, get it? Different classes? I thought they were in the same class? Why do I even bother? She thinks her daughter is of the upper class and our sons are of the lower class. Her daughter's an angel while our sons are the bad guys! How can you say that! My son is Hao Ren (good guy)! A good guy... Violet, go take a shower. Stay right there. If you mingle with them again I will take extreme measures. Yeah, right! Just like how you warned Daddy not to play golf not to go here, not to go there! No freedom at all! Sorry, I'm not Daddy! Hey... Don't be angry. Cool down, please. Why did you dress like a ghost? Spending S$200 to dress like one! You like ghosts? I'll catch one for you from Changi, free of charge! Dad, that's an anime character, not a ghost. What anime? Why are you "crossplaying"? You're my son you know we cannot afford to "crossplay". Dad, it's cosplay! Cosplay is a professional hobby. I didn't spend any money on it. All the materials were taken from our home. They're from all the junk you've collected. Who gave you permission to take my stuff? Dad, this is an investment. We need to invest to make money. If we win this cosplay competition we'll get S$10,000! Good grief! S$10,000? Come here, my son. Take a seat... Sit down. Are we talking about Singapore dollars? Of course! What else? Rupiah? Wow! I can smell a fortune coming. Go ahead. And dress up like a ghost. You can take all my stuff. I grant you permission officially! Can I cosplay whatever I want? Of course! You can be Superman, Batman even King Kong eating a banana. Anything under the sun! - Mum! - Grandma! Why are you making so much noise? If you're still keeping anything you'd better take them out now. All of it! Mummy, please don't... Sit still! This is none of your business. You neglect your studies to read these every day. All these manga, cosplay, anime they're no good for you! Mummy, I top the class every year. Isn't that good enough? You spend all your time reading these books that are filled with violence and gore. They'll corrupt your mind! Son... you're a guy. Why are you designing clothes and putting on makeup like that? It's bad enough for you to indulge in this why are you dragging your brother into it? He looks up to you and follows whatever you do! You're still... give it to me! - Mummy, please don't! - Go away! Get lost! Why are you doing this? Why can't I do the things I love? Do the things you love? You may hate me now, but you'll thank me in future! I won't! I don't want to study medicine and I don't want to be a doctor! I want to read manga and make clothes. I want to be a fashion designer! A fashion designer has no future! I don't want you to follow in my footsteps. You'll regret it for the rest of your life! If Daddy were here he'd support me. Do you know what you're saying? If Daddy were here he wouldn't be like you, so unreasonable and overbearing! What did you just say? It's your career and your future! You'll starve without a degree, not me! Bro... Bro, Snowy asks you to stop crying. What kind of attitude is that? Come back here! Stop playing! Don't do what your brother does. Coming... Hello. Please come in! Your house is so cluttered and it smells funny. My dad brought all of these back last night. These can all be sold. Your father must be a Jack of all trades. Sorry, all these will be gone tomorrow. Don't touch that! It's my dad's. Sorry, I was just checking if these things can be used as materials for our cosplay. We've run out of cash. After deducting the cost of materials from here, we're still short of... S$900. S$900? That's bad. This is just a little setback, are we going to give up? Don't you have many old computers and mobile phones? Sell some for the team! My mum did a stock take yesterday. I only managed to salvage a phone. This is for you. Thanks, once I've saved enough money I'll buy a new one for you. It's okay. I should have withdrawn more money and kept it. Shhh... I've got tons of money. - Grandma! - Shhh... please keep it a secret I'm really rich. Can she lend us some money? Grandma, quit fooling around! These are for you! Take it... I thought you wanted it... Take this. Take them all. I still have more. - Take them all. I have loads of it! - Grandma, enough... Please count them in your room. It's time to show my hand! Wow... that's a lot of money! Brother, please let go when it's time to. S$200. S$250. S$40. That's almost S$500! - Bro, how did you get so much money? - How? These are my hard-earned money. Bad Guy, you're the richest among all of us! - Yes! - Of course! Wait... we're still S$400 short. Bro, I've already sacrificed so much, cheer up! Money grubber! Okay, Mr Boo, it's me! Aren't the exams around the corner? Let me do all the talking later. Mr Boo, I'm not lying. My grandma's really sick, so I've got to work. Where is your grandmother now? She... She's in the hospital... Grandma! Come here... What's up? Grandma, why didn't you inform me about your discharge? I could've picked you up! Knock on wood! You're such an unfilial grandson! I just went out to exercise. Why are you cursing me? What did she say? She's very tired and needs to rest. Grandma, you must be exhausted. Please take a rest! Go... So, besides your grandmother's hospitalisation fees what other financial difficulties do you have? My father... he got "fried"! - He was fried? - No... he got fired. Dad! Hello, Teacher! So sorry, Sir, to hear about the loss of your job. - Mr Boo. - Hao Ren, what did your teacher say? You were fired, right? - Fired? - Mr Boo... Oh, no, I wasn't fired. My boss just raised my pay. I wasn't fired. Hao Ren, translate for me. I came here because... He came here because... Wait, how do I know if you'll translate correctly for me? Mr Boo, trust me! No, I don't trust you. I'll do it myself. - Mr Hao. - Hao Lian. I'm not hao lian (boasting). Hao Lian. I didn't say you were hao lian (boasting). - Hao Lian. - Mr Boo. My father's name is Hao Lian. He's Hao Lian, not that you're hao lian (boasting). Yes, Hao Lian. What kind of name is that? Okay. Mr Hao Lian, you mother... Hey! Hao Ren, your teacher just swore! No... He said your mother had no... How do I say this? Damn. Right! Your mother needs money to see a lor... lor mee (braised noodles)! Oh, you're hungry! Quick, buy lor mee for him. No, wait! Not lor mee (braised noodles), lor... Doctor. - Oh, lor kun (doctor)! - Lor kun (doctor)... - Right? - Yes... My mother's leg is in pain. She also has dementia and she needs money to see a lor kun (doctor). So, your mother's leg is aching, she's slightly off her rocker. And she needs money to see a doctor? Hao Ren goes out to work and he's very hardworking. He earns money to pay for his studies. He pays for the water and the "powder". Power. "Powder", power, he's a good boy. So, you've been working to support your family? People always call me money grubber and I let them. Actually, my dad doesn't earn much so I've got to work. So, you're taking part in the cosplay competition for the money? No, Mr Boo. I really fell in love with cosplay. In real life, I'm always the bad guy. But when I cosplay, I get to be a hero for a little while. Hao Ren! Tell me how much you need for the cosplay competition I'll lend it to you. Interest free. - Really? - Really. Teacher! I need money too! Can I borrow some? I can fly Master, how is he going to fly during the competition? We'll use wire on that day! Come on! Let's start! - Yeah! - Bro, you're awesome! I did it! Yes! Bro, look at me! I can do it too! - Stop! - Jordan! Stop! Mummy. I'm sorry. I-I'm really sorry! I didn't expect... I didn't expect Jordan will... There's nothing much I can do if you choose to be so immature at your age. But your brother's only eight! Bro, guess who I am? Bro, guess who I am? Bro, guess who I am? Jordan Chio! You're not even looking at me, I'm "Hopper". Stop it! Your brother's already in such a state. Why do you still have the mood for these things? What's wrong with you? Are you throwing a tantrum? What do you want from me? How did you get this? I know that you've been unhappy ever since you gave up your dream. Since young, I've told myself when I grow up I'll help you fulfil your dream. I didn't expect that... I'd cause you more unhappiness instead. Go ahead. Auntie. There's something you should know but we're not sure how to bring it up to you. Just say it. Do you know why Jordan wants to take part in the cosplay competition? Actually... If I take part in the competition and win Mummy will be pleased and never call me dumb again! Jordan always felt inferior. Why are you so dumb? Both of you came from the same womb. Why is one so smart and the other so dumb? The first drawer from the bottom! Why are you so dumb? In Jordan's world, Royston is his idol. Royston's cosplay character in the competition is actually Jordan's hero. His greatest wish is for Royston to win the competition. Auntie, please forgive Royston. Son. Son. Mummy. Do you still want to take part in the cosplay competition? No, I don't. I know you don't like it. I stopped you from pursuing your dreams because I'm afraid that you'll fail. I don't want you to follow in my footsteps. After my business fell through I ended up with a huge amount of debt. Then, your dad abandoned us without a word. Why have you not shared this with me before? That day... I went down a difficult path... and sacrificed all I had in the end. I only hope that I can protect both of you with all that I have in future. No matter how tough the coming days may be I won't let the both of you suffer. Mummy. But I'm wrong. You should choose your own path and take it bravely, no matter right or wrong. I should give you the freedom to choose. Sorry, Mummy. I'm really sorry. If not for me, Jordan wouldn't... Jordan wouldn't be... It's not your fault... Come over here. The only thing you can do now is to win this competition for Jordan. Help Jordan fulfil his dream. You're his hero! No matter what happens you have to do this for him. And for yourself. It's too late. It's only two days away. Here. We can do it. Nothing is impossible. It'll be done in time if we do this together! After two days of hard work we managed to complete the costume. We knew each other more than we ever did before. And our thoughts never left Jordan all this time. For my brother, and myself I'll fight till the end! So weak! Like insects. Am I right, Migi? No wonder the world is so chaotic. Hey, look! It's Ding Dang! Hi, Ding Dang! I feel so embarrassed for you! You're such a disgrace to the cosplay community! Go home! We are fellow cosplayers. Do you need to be such a bully? Shut up. You've just won once, don't act like a saint. Kantana's the reigning champion in cosplay. You're not even fit to compete with us. Don't be hao lian (arrogant)! You'll never know who's the winner. We've every right to hao lian (boast). What can you do about it? Wait! My name is Hao Lian. What can you do about it? Dad? I thought it was Ding Dang Junior. I was wrong! It's Ding Dang Senior! Why are you taking a photo of us? Since both of you are so famous I'll share the photo with your Instagram followers and let them witness your friendliness. - Don't you dare! - I'll do it right now! - Stay right there! - Stop! Dad, why did you come dressing like this? If you can "crossplay", why can't I? I'm here to support you! Really? Thanks, Dad! Son! Mummy. My son is so handsome today! Give it your best! Turn around. Akira asked me to be deployed here, where is she? You've been fooled! It's just a mere ruse to lure you out! Prepare yourself! Is that all you've got? Pathetic! You... What shall we do? We're up next. Where's Chen Jun? Hey. Is Chen Jun coming? Hey, it's Chen Jun! Where are you? What? - What... - What happened? He said that his grandfather is dying. He needs to rush back to Beijing. - We're dead. - So dead. His grandfather's dying, not dead! I'm referring to us! There's still hope! He said he found someone to replace him. Bullshit! Where's that person? Kiseki? You guys are up next! Bro, can you do us a favour and let us be the last to perform? Sorry, that's not possible. You'll be disqualified if you don't go now. Please help us! Mr Handsome, please! Bro, how about some... Come back next year! Are we going to give up just like that? No! I must do this for Jordan! Let's do this together! Kiseki! Break a leg! The next team performing for us is Team Kiseki! Son... go for it! Aaron, she's crying. We should help her. Lovi, stop! It's dangerous. Lovi! Lovi, stop! What's wrong? What should we do now? Why don't you go backstage first? The replacement's not here yet. What should we do? Bro, look at me! Stop! You're his hero! Win this competition for Jordan. I was so worried! Luckily, you guys were awesome! You were really great, here's a 100 likes for you! Thanks for your help. Are you Chen Jun's friend? - What's that? - Is that a yes or no? Can you let us know who you are? Hold on. No worries, we won't force you if you don't want to reveal your identity. Can we take a wefie? Okay? One, two, smile! Mr Boo! Shinwa! Shinwa? Hey! I was doing cosplay while you all were still drinking milk from bottles! I came across cosplay when I was studying in Tokyo. Straightaway, I fell in love with it. Since then I've never stopped cosplaying. You're so good at making props! Of course! I learnt from the best. Who taught you? - Mr Boo. - Yes? - This is our class report. - Okay, good. Thank you, you may go. Thank you. Helen Keller once said "There's nothing worse than being blind than a man who has sight but no vision." Hold on to your dreams. Only one thing can stop your dreams from coming true. Fear of failure. So, you guys are here. I was looking all over the place for you. Please get ready, the results will be announced soon! Let's go... Ladies and gentlemen. The moment you've been waiting for. The team who's going to walk away with S$10,000 and a trip to Japan is... The winner of the 10th Annual Asia Cosplay Summit is... Team Kiseki! My son's a sausage. Dad! Mummy! Bro! Bro, you're my hero! - Hello? - Madam Liu. Jordan's condition has stabilised. We've just transferred him to a normal ward. - Boy, my boy. - Jordan. Wake up, my boy. - Jordan. - Son. Jordan. Jordan, you're awake. I have a surprise for you. Surprise? Jordan, ta-da! Wow! Bro, you've really won! Too bad I wasn't there because I'm too dumb. Says who? You were with us all this while. Stop kidding me. Take a look at this! Wow, that's me! Look, Mummy! I'm not dumb! Boy, I'm so sorry. I'll never say you're dumb again. I'm so sorry! Sorry! Sorry. I'm so sorry! What do you want? A moment like this calls for a wefie! Come closer, boy... Are you ready? One, two, three! Let's take another one! One, two, three! Eight years later Guess what? I've become Singapore's most popular blogger. My motivation for blogging has shifted from gaining attention to inspiring others to be socially conscious. - Hey, Mummy. - Hi, dear. Please don't forget to come to my autograph session tomorrow. - Alright? Yes. - 2.00pm. - See you there! - See you! And my biggest fans are... My greatest dream is to provide my dad and grandma with a comfortable life. I've finally managed to do it! Hello? Hey, John! How are you doing? Yeah, I'm good! The condo? Yeah, it's up for sale. S$12 million. Great! Alright! So easy, see you! Hello, Dad! I've just closed a deal! Shall we eat out tonight? Abalone, seafood, king crab, shark's fin, whatever you want! Huh? Grandma wants porridge? All right, go. Not only do I get to dress to the nines every day but I also get to dress others too. I'm now a fashion designer. And my collection will be on the runway in Paris next month. Not too shabby at all. Most importantly I've fulfilled my promise to Violet and made a dress just for her. Will you marry me? Yes. Years may have passed but we'll always be... Let's welcome... Team Kiseki! Young & Fabulous! Hi, my name is Shawn and I'm a pilot. People ask me why I cosplay. Reasons... Everyone has their reasoning. For me I came from an art background. And it's an opportunity to really create anything that you want. Things online are really expensive. Everything that you see here is all self-made. Plus, the cosplay community is really small. Everyone kind of knows one another and there are so many... talented people out there that you can get to meet make friends, and it's fantastic! Hi, my name is Iris and I'm a lawyer by profession. I like cosplay because I think it's really cool. I started out by liking anime and cosplay seemed like a natural extension of that interest. Cosplay allows me to go out and meet new people and actually, it's really good because I'm really shy by nature. Hi, my name is Jokumi and I'm an engineer by day. I like cosplay because it lets me be who I'm not supposed to be. Cosplay also teaches me a lot of other new things. For example, I learned how to sew learned how to pose, makeup, etc... yeah. So, it's a very fun thing to do and who knows you might like to enjoy it yourself! Action! Robin Hood and his Merry Men. Please don't speak so loudly you'll scare me. You'll scare me. And when I'm scared, I shoot my mouth off. If "Boo Dog" gets to learn about this... Don't hit him! Pew... Pew! Pew! He's been everywhere. Only the lady boss here is... Beautiful! Can't you bring yourself to say it? Most of the "tramps" that my dad brings home... "Tramps", sorry. Jordan... - Jordan! - Why won't you wake up? Jordan! - Cut! - Recess!
