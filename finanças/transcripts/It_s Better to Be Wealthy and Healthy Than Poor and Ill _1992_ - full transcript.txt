Here we are, one tin from America. What's in it? No tin can be empty. Open it. You must open it yourself in the presence of a state authority. Authority, I understand. Western subversives are pretty tucking crafty. Let's see... Yes, of course. Subversive. ideologically. Hello, Nona, my love. I am sending you a bit of free air to freshen up that farty communism of yours. So there! I emigrated illegally with Robert Hefner in 1978. He had graduated from the Sculpture Academy and I studied Philsophy. In Munich Robert went to look for money. I waited for him at the station, but he didn't return. Not even two days later. I realized that he'd left me and run away to Canada without me. I haven't seen him for 12 years. You kicked me out of school. I was "an â€œanti-socialist individual""." The dean threw you out. Not us. We are here for something entirely different. We made these from the film we found in your camera. Those are fake. There was no film in it and you know that. If you so desperately want to lock me up, you'll make up some proof. Comrade Klinec! Excuse me. Let's go. Hello, Misa, Misa, do you hear me? Hello, hey, codeword Valra, Valra, where in god's name are you, Misa? Hello? Miro Vostiar presents a Jura] Jakubisko film Better Rich and Healthy Than POOP and Sick Starring And now one of the nurses who care for us in the hospital will say a few words. Right on! Right on! Forgive my daring, but I.. I wanted to say something. Camera and now work in the party sanatorium and... Friends, friends... Let's be a little tolerant, please. Screenplay and directed by Now everyone's talking about crimes and communists as criminals, but they're n01 all alike. NOl all... Not all of them are the same, some are the same as us. Friends, our revolution is velvet, we promised love. You're a communist? I love a man and they want to hurt him. They should applaud your courage. Wait! What's your name? I must say I am deeply moved, because, you know, a revolution, that's... Now everyone to bed! You've got three hours to sleep. Bring me today's papers, will you? No worries, Mila. Kittens, be So kind as to write il five times and have it copied, OK? So what do you think of that blonde from the party sanatorium? WHO? YOU mean the Czech? ...the communist? She's not red. She just fell for some big shot and it got to her a little. Our love stands on politics too. JUSI politics? You're divine... Nona, I love you. State Security, open up! You're under arrest! What are you, crazy? - The communists have given up. Oh Czech land, this home of mine. Oh Czech land, this home of mine. Lightning flashes over the Tatra, thunder rumbles. Lightning flashes over the Tatra, thunder rumbles. Let us rest, brothers, they will surely disappear. The Slovaks Will revive. Have a drink! Is it true that the Communism's gone to Hell? It's true! Long live Havel! Hurray! Freedom! A new age! We have to celebrate the future with endless eternal love. Then you move in with me and we live together. Wait! Wait! I have some important political information for you. We're going to have a child. YOU? We. And you're sure it's with me? Hmmmm. You bastard... I know one common solution. Which is? To get married. Yes, but I wouldn't want to put you into a submissive position. I'm thinking of your future, Nona. And that's good or bad for me? There she is... I've tried marriage once. You know. And I wouldn't want it to end like it did with my first wife. I hope you're not putting us on the same level. No, but only one person in a couple can have great ambitions. I understand, and that's you. Look, we avoided conventions during Totalitarianism. We're not going to throw that away now. A few words for the news. Are you going to enter politics after the election? What position will you take on? I've to be director of an insane asylum. The minister and two members of government are here. Excuse me, please. Come, love, I'll introduce you. Minister? Now that I have met you personally and even seen your work... Let me tell you that you are... the only candidate... ...to become Ambassador, Miss Nona. But, Minister, I am llOl suited fOf that. Hello. I'm doctor Ficner. Puco for friends. Nice to meet you. You defended Vilo in court, didn't you? You are... ...a gynecologist. You won't feel a thing, we've got the best equipment. We'll keep you there for two days and the problem is solved. AS if it never existed. Deal? You know what, dear, if you piss me off, I'll keep the baby and you'll never see it. Look, a baby isn't interesting just now. And what is interesting? Your career, huh? Well, outwith il! Go on, tell it to your chicks! Mr. Viliam, Mr. Viliam, don't! Don't let yourself be provoked. She'll ruin you. She... YOU Velvet Cunt! - How dare you! Stop it or I'll smack you one! Stop drinking and control yourself. You pathetic loser. You shouldn't have done that. We are through. One day you'll be sorry. Al least I'll know why. You'd better wise up, friend... - Stop n. You send me to get an abortion and brag to your friends... you swine... you whore chaser... politician... You're all pathetic! You can stick your politics up your arses! Career... friends... SIUIS... Fuck you... She's gone crazy! Cowards! Let me go! Why are you breaking everything? They'll lock us up! Me? I am supposed to be an ambassadress. Well, you won't be one, anyway. You're bleeding. Il doesn't hurt. I'll take care of it for you. ll doesn't hurt. Quiet, or you'll wake the building. Hell, where the Hell am I? Don't worry. You're at my place. They turned off the heat in January, SO I built the tent. Comfy, huh? Where's my camera? It's here. It's all here, don't worry. Cigarettes. Thanks. Hey, why are you taking care of me like this? I am a nurse. Professional affliction. You sure gave them what for yesterday! Dissident. We're in the same boat. Politics never interested me. I didn't even know who Was who. But I didn't care. I wanted to get married and have lots of children. I've always doubted everything I thought about. And what's il g0! me? Laco always says that it's the woman who should be careful. Are you going to keep it? What do I kn0W?... IS this him? Yeah... Do you know what he calls me? Eve. If we're apart for a while I always get flowers flying in through the window. Roses. They always smell beautiful. Red? White! I like those best! He always acts like a man. He bought me this apartment, the furniture, everything you see here. I wouldn't give in to him even on a desert island. William will be a minister, you Mrs. Minister and I'll be working alone. Uncle Kadar, what would you do, if you were expecting a child? Me? A child? Miss Nona... I mean if you were in my place. I understand. I'd flip a coin. It'll come up riches or poverty. Il would've been a powerful book. And a help financially. Unfortunately... I get it. Vilo called you. Nona, what do you take me for? You know the political boom's over. We have to do business. Who today would buy a book of meetings of dissidents? No one wants to look back, people are interested in different things... Just look around. Going to score, boss? Advertising, sex... Freedom is here. I am not worried about you. You always knew how to take care of yourself. Bye. I've changed my mind. We'll have to open these bottles outside. You'll have to save me again. Shh! It's 'cause of the neighbour. Used to be a nun, you know? Nun? I thought she'd return to the order after the revolution. But she prefers good wine to the cloister. It's open. Inspection! I hear sinful sounds... I brought you something, little Ester. Now, where's that medicine? Here! Oh, girls, what are you up to?! It's a Sin! Out in space a soul is seeking a soul and it will miss the unborn other one. How funny. But what if that soul dies of starvation? Don't worry about that. If God provides a lamb he provides food for it. And it might be a boy. It will be if Margita says so. Get up... We'll carry on the family name forever. Even Jesus Christ drank wine. Now wait... January '58... Let me think... Dog! You were both born in the same year of the dog. You, Nona, were born in the dark of night, biting and scratching in the name of justice. And you were born as a dog, in the daylight, you're like a puppy. And without each other you mean nothing, but together, together... Even without a man the destiny of a woman can be fulfilled. You'll eat from the same bowl with golden utensils. Tragic victim of the Velvet Revolution. Dear bereaved one, dear guests, Before you lies a man who did not leave us voluntarily. You ask why he chose death over life? Laco performed much unrewarded work of merit for security of the state. Instead of gratitude he was insulted, spat on, threatened with investigation. BUt heroes CIOI'I'II die. God be with you, dear Laco. Think about why he did il. Certainly not because of you. He had a family, a wife, children and he kept you. Who knows what he had on his conscience! I loved him! You stupid fool! Because of a shitty undercover agent. What's with you? Come here! You have to! Shut up! Properly! Hear me? Out with it! All Of it! YOU have t0! YOU have t0! I didn't want to poison myself. I just took some sleeping pills because I couldn't fall asleep. One is enough for that. You were great. Go, get dressed, we are going. It's an Old folks home tonight. Smile! Wait, I'll take care Of this. For you. Thank you. Wait. What? What's up? What do you want? Hand over that film. And what good is it to you? I'll pay you for it. How much, huh? This doesn't cut it, boss. Hey, wait. Or I'll slug you. Your choice. Go make out at home! In bed, children of freedom. Open up! Open, or I'll kill you! Hear me? Open... Excuse me, I have to get out. Oh, right, when in Home... Open the door, immediately! Hell! Well... Interesting toilet paper. Who is here? Me. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. Something happened? I am scared, Nona. You are scared and you're sitting here in the dark?! Laco's not dead. I saw him. Well, it happens. You think I'm crazy or hallucinating! That he can't be alive if he hung himself and had a funeral. But I saw him. OK, OK. I saw him in the courtyard with our chief doctor. I saw him this close up. Why would he die and then show up. Especially here. That doesn't make sense. I know, but I have a strange feeling. I've never told you that but Laco was strange. Everything was unreal with him. He was attracted to me from the very first moment, when he came as a patient. I feel like I'm in the garden of Eden. And look, an apple! Comrade, I'll stop and nothing will save you from an operation. Eve, ice can never save me, only your burning heart. I'm Ester, not Eve. Why do you speak Czech when you're a Slovak? So that you can understand me better. I liked him very much, maybe because I'd never had a man before, you know. Then came a really cute misunderstanding, he was so crazy for me that he took an ordinary pre-surgery as a foreplay. Eve, I knew this moment would come. I saw it in your eyes. Oh, leave that for some other girl. I have to do something unpleasant to you now. Comrade! This is getting you excited! Yes. Don't worry, it'll be done in a second. Comrade! What are you doing to me? Don't faint... Oh... But comrade... it seemed that it would stay that way forever, a miracle. The party surgeons refused to operate on him in this embarrassing condition. So I took treatment upon myself. In the Party Sanatorium they stole everything. Medicine, food, towels, All that was left in the kitchen were the apples in the garden. That dramatically sealed our fate. That time I almost believed that Laco Was dead. Laco? Laco, don't die on me, Laco! Don't die, Laco, Laco! What are you scared for? Heroes don't die, Eve. OK, OK, we are going. Oh, good morning. Good morning, Miss Nona. You have a package. Sign here. Hey! You got a package! I see the patients have to see to themselves today. I'm done with nursing. I'll find something new. Prepare yourself for a burst of fresh air. From Japan? Well, you sure have contacts, you dissident. Hello, my goddess. Soon you'll hold a magic bird in your hands. Like him, I'm flying on the wings of my desire to you in Europe. Robert. Why does he call you a goddess? It's from mythology. Nona was one of the Three Fates weaving the threads of destiny. JUSI like US. And we're Still in the pits, aren't we? Go ahead, fly, you fake. You won't fool us with this cock of yours. Lie on your back, put the cock down and breathe erotically. I am embarrassed, Nona. Oh, come on! Nothing will show in the picture. I won't pour a drink for you, if you're embarrassed. Inspection! I hear sinful sounds... Our business is done for. Oh, you poor girls, what are you doing? It's sinful! This won't bring you happiness. - Have some wine. Margita, you owe us a prophecy from last time. You didn't finish it. Come. The universe is in motion. There is a time for everything. Dear Lord, show me the way. Where are you leading us to understand our fate. I see light and darkness, I see money, richly decorated walls of a palace and the palace is full of silver, silver melodies. Margitka... on, my head... Well,hurray, aren't we wiser now? Try it again. I didn't understand anything. Wait, stay like that. I don't know what we're doing tomorrow, but I know what we're doing today. There, look up there... Oh, Mother Mary! Maybe I'm Jewish. Ester is a Jewish name. We're all God's children. I'll even christen you. Laco didn't believe in God. But I know he exists... Who else would protect me? What do you think, Nona? I don't know. I am a Lutheran, but never got much church time in. Sacred pictures! The Virgin Mary of Lourdes. Only five again. The Virgin's not very popular. What if we tried those nudes? I wouldn't feel embarrassed. Maybe I would even get married. You're sinning again. Not sinning, Margitka. You know what we'll make our living on now, ladies? People's vanity. Everything people have so far had on photographs, they want now in moving pictures, with sound. Wives, children, birthdays, weddings... Know what I mean, Margitka? Moving pictures. What? - Video. You can get a Japanese video camera here and save half the price. Won't it be some kind of crap? - Don't worry. I know technical people. We want a video camera. What brand? Panasonic. An open box, or in the original packaging? I'd like to test il first. Don't hold things up. Give us an original, there's a warranty inside. Couldn't we try il first? If you can't decide, come back another time. We have made a decision! I told you we want an original box. Fine, here it is. Thanks. Pay for it. Warranty's inside. Here's the batteries. Thank you. I'm here every month, if you have any problems. See you. Thank you. See you later. Easy now, easy, people. This time it will be us who surprise Margita. Give it to me. We'll see how she reacts to seeing herself on TV, the little soothsayer. It's nice. Careful. It's wood. Very funny. On, wood... We'll go back and get them. Yeah, and they're just waiting around torus. Bastards. Don't cry. That won't get us anywhere. I'm not crying for myself. I'm crying for the little lamb. If God gives a lamb, he gives it food. He does, doesn't he? I'll pay you back. I'll sell everything here. Even the furniture. You dOn't have to do that. We'll get through this. You're kind. I don't know what it is. Everything I do turns out wrong. I was born under a bad sign. You're not the only one. I just don't advertise it and don't make it a life-long excuse for myself like you do. I used to be trusting too. I wanted to believe in miracles. But everyone took advantage of me. Want to hear how I lost my virginity? I didn't know you liked men. He was a great painter and really reckless. He looked at the world... bewitchingly. I used to read Houdini's book to him for hours on end, because he'd decided to become an illUsinist. And with similar success Robert Houdini performed his hypnotic dream in the air. One day he hit me, in the middle Of dreaming, over my head with a bottle. I didn't know what was going on at first. I felt fear, but ecstasy at the same time. I lay there with eyes closed and longed for it never to end. But he disappeared... It didn't happen again until years later. By then he was a sculptor and took over my lite. Who's that? Inspection! Ah, margitka... but we didn't open any bottles. They brought this package from that movement of yours. When you weren't here. It's all the way from Holland. Another miracle. Come on, let's open it. - Ahh, the artist is in Holland. An urn! He's dead? Yeah, sure. Hello, my goddess. As you see, I am in Europe. The earth is black here, like it is in Slovakia. If you water it, there'll be one more miracle in the world. He'd like to make me cry, cheater. Once was enough. Smells nice! Erotica, soft erotica! It's me! My body in flowers. Hand coloured. Excuse me... Excuse me... Didn't I tell you that if people don't have enough money for a clothed saint, they won't have enough for a nude saint. What are we dragging? Butter. - Real one or erotic one? Depends where you spread it. Butter, cheapest post-revolution butter! Butter, 14 crowns. Here you are. There you go, two butters. Buy now! It's a good deal all around. The Moravians give it to us dirt cheap, the Slovaks are happy it only costs 14. If only we didn't have to buy gas. We should place an ad for a good man and finally enjoy ourselves. As you said, fear and ecstasy. We'd scream in ecstasy simultaneously. Dwarves... Hey, girls, don't be grumpy, come with us, We'll load you on the back, it's empty. Go on, come with us. Come on, Nona, it'll be fun. Didn't you say we needed to save on gas? Let me go, please, I don't want to... Let her go, you dirty bastards! Leave her alone! - Come here, baby! YOU whore! I've got you photographed, see you in court! YOU left the keys in the truck, you simpleton. The bimbo's stealing our truck. It's not even paid for yet. Move your ars! We have to catch them. Stop! Stop in the name of law! it is a private property. The bitch wants to kill US. What are you standing there for? Don't you see she's braking? Catch her! Grab here! Got it! Don't let it go! Ah, shit! Well, there, my clever puppy. We've had the men and I think I even heard the ecstatic screaming. You overdo it with that fairness of yours. Certain things have to be carried out all the way till the end. In the spirit of democracy we've invited our popular politician to respond... Well, take a look at dady, he's not going to have enough even for alimony. My fellow citizens... You know me... Noe we're both in the same boat. There's a difference, isn't there? Oh no, my dear Baroness, he was an informer just like mine. That's unbelievable. My ties with the Secret Police were practicaly non... It's all filth. Once I met a Secret Police employee... Mail... Another bill? You're not in love, you use little salt. Robert...?! You're back? As oyu can see, I do what I write. Please, tell me what all those cans mean. I simply thought those toys would bring you happiness. Come on, smile. I imagined this meeting of ours differently. Don't take il badly... You know when I lost you... We were both lost. Wow! You have my torso. Such a naive work. It was all so laughable. Depends for Who. Admit il, you left me for another woman. As if I could. I have only you. I waited for you three days at the station. Tough luck, my boy. If you only knew how much I thought of you. Mr. Robert, you've forgotten something. We're waiting for a miracle. We'll cry later. Very funny. America, Africa, paradise, very nice. Well, you'll have to plant an entire garden of Eden before I forgive you. I didn't count on you returning, you convinced me of that... And you thought someone would pick me up at that train station? That's not the point. You don't realize that you ruined my life. I thought you could live without me. - Come on, Robert. You were stronger than me. You returned. You don't even know you're better off. I was afraid. Let's leave il at that. It's past now. Remember what I always said? I free man lives withou worry, like a king, but dies like a beggar. Alone. A married man lives like a beggar, but dies like a king, surrounded by his family. And I wanted to live like a king and die like a king. I believed it was enough to marry just before dying. And it is possible, my king. To found a family before dying. But I don't want to be a king anymore. I want to have family and children. Somethings happened to me. I have to find myself, like I found you. I can't stay in one place. I am a wanderer. If I change, will you still love me? Can you feel me? I can! I greet you all on behalf of those ex-patriots the Totality forced across the ocean. I am thrilled, my dear compatriots... lam glad I could... Twice... ...could see you and shake your hand and look into your eyes... VilO! Is that you? I hope you don't believe what they write about me. It's misinformation from the castle circles to discredit Slovak disidents. What castle? Those are your friends, aren't they? I seemed too strong, too popular to them. Since when are you such a great Slovak? YOU didn't come HCTOSS "K6 that in the boiler room. You don't understand, Nona. Situation is serious. YOU should have kept the child. And why? A could have been a good father. Another bit Of desinformation. Everything is OK, let's go. Greetings, old man. Hi. Who's this? It's VilO. Who? But you know him. He's your friend. Wow. Politics has sure done a number on him. You look great. How are you? Fine. And you? Well, you know, home is home. Shame you didn't come earlier. Our necks were on the line here. That's life. Let's go. You can choose who you want, boy, but only one of us is Adam. I'll g0 back to the States and organize my things. I'll sell everything and move here. Especially my sculptures. I'll put on I'll put On an exhibition and start selling them. To spas, businesses, they'll go like hotcakes. Here? Of course. You know what I've seen in the world? What I've learned? Do you understand? Well, bon voyage. And if you want to come back and became a beggar, make haste, my king. And don't forget that I'm not as strong as I look. Gone again, the swindler. I fell for il again, like a doggie for a biscuit, he didn't seem at all like a swindler to me. He could at least have left us some sweaty dolars. So why didn't you put the squeeze On him a little? Because I'm stupid. And because of that we're now selling all of my furniture and Laco's pictures. We'll sleep on the floor. Watch out! You've got a secret entrance? Margita lives next door. What!? Margita? Inspection! Margitka! I hear Sinful sounds. I've never been here before. You keep cats. Those are my children, heavenly cats. They don't sow, they don't reap, and God takes care of them after all. There's more space than at a trainstation. I am cold, girls.I'm sorry we can't heat this up. Hell, if we knocked d0Wn that wall... we'd have a perfect studio. Understand? We'd start a company. Look out! Building a company, that's a nightmare. If someone wants to get rich, someone else has to become poor. This is all I've got. Look. Some little things, few rosaries... Margitka, don't worry. You gave the company the space. I'll pray for you. So that we don't stray off the righteous path and tall into sin. And what if we do stray Off the path? Then I'll ask God for forgiveness. It's a deal. You'll be our lucky charm. I've also got a gold watch. I wanted to give il to the lamb, but this way I'll do more for him. Cat. Laco. White. But he's dead. Someone's trying to scare us. He's following me. Great spirits never die. They may not die, but I've never seen them throw flowers to their girlfriends through windows. Stop, girls. Stop! Get off the road. I see hellfire... Satan... I'll wait for you. Smile. We'll be right back. That was smooth. Do you think she is a lesbian? Where's the car? We were parked here. Very funny. Damn, where's the car? Margita... Margita, where's the car? Why didn't you stay in m! Where's your second sight? I fell aleep. I had a life-like dream. The universe opened up and the Archangels Rafael and Gabriel lifted me Up like a feather and I was flying. And we're grounded. I had a car. I had furniture. And I am going to have a child. Stop. Forgive me. You should return to the cloister, Margitka. They've restored your order. I can't go back there. I'm not worthy. I was just 19 when they put me into an old factory. Well, what about il, bride of Jesus? Has Pontius Pilate snagged you yet? Pilate was the warehouse keeper all the nuns were afraid of. Dear Mister Pilate, you need to give me a screw like this. That tiny? Wouldn't you rather have a bigger one? Have a drink. I don't drink, thank you. You've probably got nice hair. Let's see! No, down, Satan! YOU believe in the devil? Have you ever seen him? Have you? No? I'll show you. You're so pretty. That demon violated my body. Scratched a diabolic sign into my flesh. I can't go back to the cloister. There's nothing there. Dear God, are you blind? Those signs burn. I am no longer a bride of Christ. I have to stay with you forever and pray for your sins. God created saints and whores. Where is it writen, what we are supposed to be? Hey, up here... Hey! I told you, when a man is turned on, he's powerless. Yeah, but they've always got money in their pants. Help... Pig! Pervert! They've got him. Tram! Run. Get in, joker. That one was in shape. Probably an athlete... Well, he's got a nice wife and kids. Pig... We like sex every which way. Quick, switch Off the phone. Damn, where did he put the money? Nothing in his pants. Here we are. Yeah, got something? Cheques, cards... Elisabeth! Pounds! Car keys! A car fOl' a car! Things have started moving. One after the other. Let's go shopping! The fun starts! Am I supposed tostrip down or what? Unbelievable! I could pray all day in a church like that. I used o sing too, you know? Great Margita! Even the pigeons are scared. He who sings divinely prays doubly. Here we are! Over here! You've spent everything? Not a shilling, Margitka. Things came back on their own. Just like in your prophecy. Very funny. What um you say w him? We have to get these presents to the family. Not tar from here. What else did you tell him? Nothing, just told him to change the oil and brake pads. We'll drive back through Czech lands. Things in Slovakia could be hot for us. Strange language the're speaking here. Are we back in Vienna? No, Margitka, it's Prague. The Czechs have the Crown Jewels here, Margita. Are you going to steal them? Just be good and pray here. And you can even sing. Just be careful, my kittens. There, a cross and a kiss. I'll wait here for you. See you tonight, Margita. Love, Lord, Love... Where do people find you... What are you doing here? This is our turf. What do you mean, turf? Shut up and mind your own business. I see, a lady from Slovakia! Yes, Bratislava. Of course. No decent foreigners come to that shithole. So these Slovaks steal our business. Very funny. If you don't get back to treading water in that Dunai River of yours, we'll kick your arses! Just try it, you walking nightmare. Czech whore! Poliiiice! Get on home, ladies, or we'll keep you here. How come they let them go and are keeping us? YOU heard it. """The ladies are from Slovakia.""" Fucking whores. We should've known this is going to cost us. Poor Margita. What Will she do WilhOU US? Nothing. She'll pray until morning. That one's got good pants. Quiet, please. Be quiet. I feel sick. No need cry. You let go. Me worse. Me on plane and home. Bad there. People hungry. What did you do? Nothing. Us two in bar. Czech boys and yelling: """Vietnamese go home!"" Now all must go" even he not Vietnam. There. See? Arseholes always win. And you say our nations have nothing in common. We have to do something. No need. Judge say we all """undesire person""." This calls for a good deed, no? No... ...seven, eight, nine, ten. You wait me here? Yeah... Run. Come here, quick! I've seen that yellow one somewhere before. I am Aj-Lan-Se-Kung-Shun-La-Bu-Day. Saigon. We'll just call you Saigon, OK? Me born again. Thank you I want go Vienna, have many brother there. To Vienna? Well, you're on the right train. Bratislava is more or Vienna. Greetings, my native Moravia! Careful, cops! The gig is up. Saigon, hide! But they're Russians. Well, what do you want? They've got weapons. This is a rocket pistol. Don't you have a normal one? That one's no good What will we do with it'? Everythings in motion, like Margita says. At least we'll be more secure. I won't give you more. I think I saw him again. Laco in a white suit? No, in a uniform. They were right here. Where did they go? It's all a dream. Soldiers, weapons, our lives... We W0h't make the commercial. lt'S Oh the other side of the t0Wh. I was an unbeliever. On December 26 God appeared to me. And I {Old this to the pastor. And the pastor said: Make a nice wooden church and collect donations for a house of God. From that day I've lived righteously and call on you to follow the same path. Donate something so that your sins will be forgiven. Here's my address. There, you give us 700 crowns and the tape is yours. But I'm just starting out. When I make something, I'll gladly pay. Hey! Hang on. And what about money? Here's my address. Well, well... The wood camera man! Get underssed! - You're joking! Everything in the universe meets one day Our honestly earned money is... Shit! Come on. What do you want? There's nothing here. Keep looking! He must have money somewhere. Nothing,man. Nothing, this is crazy. I can't believe this. This is crazy. Wait, come here. Ha! Bread! Tyres too. Damn, it's jammed. Come on. Just you wait, you Australian capitalist whores.I'll find you. What do I do with this piece Of crap? Throw it away. It doesn't even work. Bag. Catch! Sorry, brother, but it's necessary. That's life. Guess how much we have. What do I know, twenty-five? Fourty! That's over a Million in Crowns! We are millionaires! Millionaires! A miracle! - Biblical miracle! So, here's ten thousand, that's a quarter of a million in Crowns. ThiS Wi" be OUT business fund. We'll call il a federal fund. And this we'll keep separate. Wait, to make it fair... I'm financing Margita and you're on your own. I'm financing the lamb. Did you forget? That two of us, too. Sorry, mommy... - We have to be rational. When it comes to money, I stop at nothing. These riches make me nervous. BUt we can't back down now. I can't wait, we'll go shopping for beautiful things. Don't you tell anyone. Excuse me? You cannot breathe a word. Not even to Margitka, understand? I've already picked out a new dress. This money smells of crime. Why is he following us'? And he's flashing his lights. Get a move on! - What if it's him? WhO? - That con man. He came for his money. Oh, please. Look around! Come on. Keep calm. He's going to run us over. Quick! We should've bought more of those grenades. Saigon! Help! Why are you running from me. Help me out instead. YOU HUI! YOU SCHTOU me. What do you hev there? Fragile goods, hot rolls... I came like I said I would... solid character, no? You're expecting a baby? Wow! We have to celebrate. Please. Bun. Thanks, kid. No, no, I not kid. Me 32 years. Thanks, 32 years. Saigon is the only man in our company. Hot rolls. Those are curves! What do you see? Nothing. A woman and a child... You see nothing. You feel it... GOld watch. - Not entirely. But it lOOks it. Real gold would be better. It doesn't matter, does it? They're beautiful, thank you. Robert, you don't want to pretend not to be rich, You're American. A real millionaire doesn't give money away. If he did, il wouldn't help the poor and he himself would become poor. If there weren't rich people, the poor would lose their illusions about wealth, their lives would become colourless, dreamless... I could go for something sour. A miracle... Guess what's in it. The sky. - Food would be better. Money. Well, 32 years! I never! Margita, you haven't foretold anything for our traveller here. I don't want to anymore. I've even lost the sound and picture in my head. You have no idea how hard it is to pray away the sins of others. Are you telling me that you waited twelve years for me? I didn't know you'd come back. A time comes when you must decide and bear the consequences. I kept the baby because I didn't want to be alone. Is it an insurmountable obstacle for you? But the baby is yours anyway! - Mine? Yes, because I was thinking of you at the time. Should I give it away? Should I? No! Damn, that VilO. Have a good look. It might be the last time. Nona, give him some money...! Still nothing about our robery of the century'? Just a nine-year-old boy's ad... took his bike and disappeared. Poor boy, he'll never trust another adult. This calls for a good deed. What do you say? We'll buy him one! Good millionaires should economize. You heard it too. You used to care for people, not money. Better to be rich and healthy that poor and sick. You're clever, 32 years. You could even make real banknotes. This paper. Bank recognize. Better make iron money. It looks here as if you were making that money already. Here I am at the gates of Hope and look how I've ended up. No one here knows what's going on out in the world. You can't get government projects, ther's no national commision. The phones don't work, the phoneboxes are broken. Everything's topsy turvy all of a sudden and nowhere to turn. You're moving? Yes. Cheat. Robert, you scoundrel. You keep me in suspense... when are you going to get some sense? First we begin advertising the company. Then we start doing big business. As a dating service. Nona and I are willing to give it all we have. And that's more than a little. It's not a bad idea, but we have to do the business abroad. Canada. We won't survive here. We have to come up with something new. Perhaps every Slovak living in America needs a good woman. A slovak woman. The Czechs need Czech women. That's our chance. There are more Slovaks living abroad than here. Want to fuck? Come on! Come on. Leave her. Can't you see she doesn't want to? Do it to yourslef today. Aren't you conscientious? It wans't so bad during Communism, was il? You had meat every day, a job, you could drink at work without getting fired. Now I can't afford n. Very funny. Czech girl, pay the tab and I'll do it to you like you've never had it in the Czech lands. Thanks, but I've already had one Secret police agent. Convenient for you, throwing everyone in the same barrel. Even me, Slovak. I IOId you to knock il Off, but you won't stop till somebody samcks you. Go on, run away, the nation will remember you. No more good times in the boiler room for you. How America, how America... Welcome, welcome again our one and only America. OK, I think that's enough. I was good, huh? Hope you can sell me. Great. Two... we'll see. I'd like to meet someone too, but I can't sing. Everyone's got some talent. - Hm, everyone. I can cure men. Are you sick by chance? As you can see, I'm not dying yet. I said smile, girls. I'd cut in the close-up...! One person, two flight tickets. What iS it that you want, to sleep with a circus or to find a bride? All right. We'll cut him. Ester, please, Robert is being considerate and you, woman, smoke here. Take the smoking next door. Yes, go next door. I'm learning, you see. She's learning, you see. Saigon, you're not sleeping. - No, I making money, iron. You're an artist. - Then I give you, and the lamb. Nice. - Thank you for my freedom. I make money, much, and then leave. You want to leave? Don't you like it here with us? I small and yellow. I sad my brothers in Vienna. Don't be sad. But I don't have anything against Czechs. But why not anyone from Europe? doesn't know anything about Slovakia â€œNothing butâ€œ â€œCzecho, Czechoâ€œ â€œeverywhereâ€œ How are we going to communicate with nations we don't understand when we can't even communicate With CZGOHS? Being Slovakian doesn't mean anything yet You have to get ahead in this world using your abilities But of course, after all we're a wise and industrious nation In less than no time, we'll be worldly and rich How do you want to get rich if not through your work? Look what you have made me into How are you with? The Czechs? You're on the wrong track there madam, I'm the Czech here Did you know that Janosik's grandfather came from Prague? And that his parents were Jews? YOU didn't know that Julka? Out! I said, out! The Slovakians could have gone further if it weren't for people like you When my hair dries... Get out ...! Give me those curlers. We should have taken more of those garnets They would have come in handy now People are as aggressive as animals when they are afraid What are they afraid of? - Poverty perhaps. Everyone is afraid of that - Did you see how many rings she had HO'S behind US - WhO that girl? No ... that black marketeer we fleeced Don't turn around - Don't panic! He can't recognise us that's why we changed our hair We'll smuggle you to Vienna, but then you're on your own. Goodbye, Margita, I not forget. I make money, I come back. Take care, butterfly, now go. Saigon, you were a great help. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Remember you have money under the food. Thank you, you kind... Nona... all. Come on, or even I'll start crying. Keep quiet at the border. I'll give them Margita's passport. You just keep praying quietly. Understand. Father, now show us your... Come to me, darling, I'm waiting. Cleanse yourself of sin. I... I don't know. This is where we started. Remember, my goddess? Yes, but what are those people doing here? Washing away their sins. This is a purgatory for all sinful Slovaks Don't you want to go for a dip too? I'm just an ordinary person, politics never touched me. No one is innocent. We'll cleanse your soul. Why do they all have scythes? We're a hard-working nation. Don't be afraid, that's a friend of your girlfriend's. And WhO i5 that? That? He is mine and I am yours. We're all one big family here. Ask him, why he keeps throwing flowers into our window. You mean white roses, but I'm the one who throws them in. Last time I threw in a box of chocolates. Why do you do n? Because I love you, Nona. I love you. I can't hear you. Your ears are plugged up. Put a finger in your ear. Finger... I'm losing my mind! Wonderful, more... more... I'm not shy. I'm pretty. Can you feel... I can feel... Wait, where are you... Go on... Oh, look who's up... We're making tapes... For what? She wants a fiCh Canadian. Canadian. Ester. Nona, wait, Nona! Don't make a scene... It's nothing. I know... it's just a tape. You wanted to say something else. Now I'm like the dog that was born in the night. suspecting everyone. I'm losing the feeling of being at home here.Maybe you shouldn't have come back. When I came back, I didn't know that this i5 the time when it's important to be here. You're wrong, Robert, now it's the time to emigrate. You've already talked me into it once. Then you stayed at home and I lost out. I want to live a normal life without worrying that somebody will ruin it. You keep dreaming that one day you'll leave and be better off, but I've lost those illusions. You can't emigrate from unhappiness, Nona. Even in America people are unhappy, and where can they go? I'm suffocating here, Robert, I'm afraid... Please... Let's leave. What good is democracy to us if we can't buy bread? What good are the open borders if our arses are bare? We didn't fight... Wait here for me. ...against Communism to live in a new Totalitarianism. We know how to and want to govern ourselves. No foreigners are going to dictate to us. Slovaks, Slovakia is our nation... I believe Mr. Klinc, he means well for us. After the hundred-year tyranny of Hungarians, we finally wake up. On our feet Slovaks... Federation Out with those among us who are against us. What a surprise, we know each other! This is one of them! Traitor! Going against his own people! Get him, get him! Robert! Robert! Run off again. All men are cowards. Ester, is that you? Yes... It's gotten a little complicated. Ewe'll be back later. Do you want to speak with Robert? He's just come back. He's home already... Put him on. Nona. You're repeating yourself. You left me again, you cheat. I just wanted to tell you... You were right. As always. Now is the time to emigrate. We'll talk about that later. Think about what you're going to say to me. It'll have to be a great excuse. Take it easy. You know you shouldn't get upset. Don't worry. I'll take a taxi, but I'll take it out of your pay. Robert, hot buns are here. Robert! Very funny. What were you doing that the place is such a mess? Margita... Margita! Ther's a time and place for eberything. I'm still alive. Forgive us, Nona, but love was stronger than us... Oh, God. Give me your hand and turn out the light. I'll see your image more clearly in the dark. Margita, it's coming. Margita! Help me. Here you are, aunt. Margita was right, we'll always be together. Did you come to brag? Nona, I missed you. I'm not interested. - Nona, I came only because of you. Do I have to kill you to get rid of you? Go ahead then... We didn't want to rip you off. You filth! Listen... Robert said we'd return it all. You filthy pig! - Stop it. What did you come here for? Why did you come? Stop screaming... You forget who told him we had the money. You were the first who wanted to run away with him. So it's my fault. It was me who took your man and your property. I didn't even leave you the shitty camera. I... Nona, cut it out. I came to cry. Go ahead. Nona, he was a scoundrel. He took everything. He ripped me off just like you. Nona, if you only knew how I had to work to make enough to get back here. Don't cry. He left you with nothing? No, he left me something... LOOK. What do you think? All right. Come on, you sinner... This is our family home. My family was here for 200 years, then it was turned into a vegetable warehouse We'll clean it Up a little and make it inlO a hotel. Please... A hotel... Margita, look who's back. Does she still pray? She can't die until she prays away our sins. She'll be here. at least a hundred years. I {Old myself that I'd find my fortune. And look how I ended up. Men are only happy when they long for something and don't have it. We were sick from poverty, fear of life. We wanted to put the universe in motion and it moved. The thief robbed the thief. Everything comes back in life, Ester. Sins as much as good deeds. Who said something about sin here. I have to lOOk into that. Margitka, I brought you something. Bunnles. Saigon's here! Saigon? I long time look for you. I be rich and you be rich. We have much money. Could we be rich against our will? Hard currency. But Saigon, this 5 is reversed. Reserved? But they're nice. Everything is like I predicted. Smile! Don't you feel like starting life over? I do. We're rich and healthy, like Adam and Eve in Paradise. Except that we don't have any money. I'm hungry! Come on, let's go and eat. The greatest fortune is when the right things come at the right time. Look what good food I've cooked for you. Want some too? Children need a father. I'm Robert. And you? I am Robert too. We'll be friends. You have a white nose. And you have a red one. This is your can. Open it! If you guess what's in it. Hot buns. Nope. Maybe... Our souls, my friend. Open it. Yes, but after dinner. If we opened the tin now, our souls would go flying around the world like birds. And they would never meet again. Oh, then let's never touch it.
