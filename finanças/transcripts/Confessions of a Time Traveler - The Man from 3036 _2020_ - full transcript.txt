- It sounds like a plot from a movie. Police are trying to unravel the true identity of a mystery man. - Time travel. It sounds like something out of a sci fi movie, when in fact, it could be more of a reality than we think. - Scientists now claim time travelers could use parallel dimensions to visit the past. - Police say that it is possible that this guy just has a very active fantasy life and that it might not be something more nefarious than that. - It was this picture from a security camera police used to identify the man accused of stealing. - It's under investigation what the true motive behind this is. We are exploring his mindset and any possibility that mental health played a role in this. - The one thing police have not been able to figure out, the person's identity. - It was a shock not only to the public but to investigators too. - We received startling information from the state lab regarding the presence of an unknown male profile. - The DA says they are still conducting multiple DNA tests. They won't say where investigators are in the testing process. - There's this mystery person. - No one knew who he was. - That throws a big question mark into a case like this. - An unidentified man. Investigators aren't losing hope they'll one day put a face to a man who so far doesn't show up in any missing person database anywhere in the country. - So, you may have seen this story in the news. Time Traveler from 3036 arrested. Unidentified man gets arrested for stealing, claims to be from the year 3036. Authorities say the unknown man has no birth record, no social security number, and no identification file on record. When asked why he was stealing, he told police he thought clothing and food was free in the market places. He later explained this to be part of the new society in the year 3036, the year he is supposedly from in the future. - Hello? - Hi, Sebastian? - Who is this? - Yep, my name's Jack Helms. Is this Sebastian? - Yes. - Yes, my name's Jack. I'm a journalist and documentary filmmaker. I was really intrigued by your story. Just curious if I can have a quick minute of your time to talk. - What about? - Well like I was saying, I'm absolutely fascinated by your story and I'm sure I can speak for everyone when I say this, but I'd love to know more about the future. - You're better off not knowing. - What's that? - I said you're better off not knowing. - Not knowing what? - You said you wanted to know more about the future and I'm telling you you'd be better off not knowing. - Why do you say that? - It's just not what you think it would be. - Would you be open to doing an interview with me? - I'm really not trying to do interviews, stuff like that. - I completely understand, but I really believe you and I believe your story. I just feel like your perspective on things would be important to probe. And the things you know must be truly incredible. Would you please just give me a few minutes of your time for an interview? - Yeah, okay. - Great, great. I appreciate it very much. I'll call you later this week to schedule a good time, okay? - Yeah, that's fine. You must be Jack. Do you have a cell phone on you? - Yeah. - Please turn that off now. If you absolutely must keep it on for emergency purposes, please put it in airplane mode and please do that now. - Okay. - We're gonna go over here and talk. - All right. So, why are we here? - I like it here. It's a good place to come and gather your thoughts. You know? - Well, I want to thank you for taking the time to meet us today. I expected you to be bald though 'cause in all the pictures I've seen, you're bald. - Yeah. I didn't have hair when I first got here. You see, people's hair doesn't grow in the future. - Why not? - Radiation. Manmade radiation is so concentrated by the 2080s that people don't grow any hair anymore, men and women alike. - So, why the mask? - I have to wear it. - And why is that? - My immune system. Everybody in the future has to wear masks or respirators when going outdoors. - When does this all happen? - It's happening right now. If you had any idea what you were breathing in right now, you'd be wearing a mask too. - Why is that? - I already told you. You're not gonna want to hear this stuff. There's nothing good about it. How old are you? - 42. - Yeah, see? You'll be long gone way before this stuff starts to affect anybody. - What do you mean? - Peoples' health rapidly declines over time. It's basically unstable and unfit conditions for the next 90 years from now. You see, by the 2080s, everything changes. Over a billion people die as a result of it, and that's just in a 20 year span. Practically everybody born after that point is born with high levels of ionized metals in their bloodstream. And that's one of the main reasons our immune system is so weak and that's why I asked you to turn off your cell phone. The amount of radiation that comes from your cell phone is enough to make me feel extremely sick. I get chest pains, headaches, vomiting. The amount of radiation coming from your devices is off the charts. You know, cell phones, they're banned in the future. They were completely banned by the 2060s when they realized how harmful they were for you. A matter of fact, the 5G roll out you guys have going on right now is the beginning of it all according to our history books. If you guys understood how dangerous these frequencies are, you'd have never agreed to it. You people are oblivious to it. It's crazy. There's no self aware people in this time. Everywhere you go, you see children and babies with cell phones in their hands. You have no idea how dangerous it is You know in the future, they refer to this time as the idiot era. No offense. But you guys just don't have any idea. The average lifespan by the 2080s is around 40 years old for men and 50 years old for women. That's all because of the radiation. It gets better. It takes time. By 3010, things have started to look up. But it'll always be a problem. Probably a problem we'll never fix. It doesn't matter. - The official report is that Sebastian, the man from 3036, could not be identified by any official documents whatsoever. It was verified by officials that his name or at least the name he's using has never been in any previous databases. This guy basically has no records at all. So that's a pretty good trick. So do you plan on staying here? - I can't go back. The technology's not even here yet, even I wanted to. I'll say that loosely. The technology is absolutely here. It's just not readily available like it is in my time. Perhaps you've heard of the Montauk Project the the Philadelphia Experiment. These are all time travel missions funded by the US Military. - So is time travel normal in the future? Like does everybody do it? - Well, no. Everybody knows that it's real and that it's feasible, but it's restricted for military purposes and elite staff only. If a resident or a civilian is caught time traveling, it's prohibited. - So is the future like they say it's gonna be like flying cars, and robots, and all that? - Yeah, we've got flying cars. They're called F-crafts. We've got robots, primarily working off of AI. We don't have homes like you do now. We have what's called pods. Homes were completely done away with by the 3000s. Pods are, they're like homes but a lot smaller, airtight, sealed. They don't affix to the ground. They use magnetic technology. So basically, you flip a switch, it locks, you flip off the switch, it unlocks, and this is done for transportation purposes. Robots are primarily used for labor positions. AI, which you have already started to implement in your time but we use on a much larger scale. - The first story I read about you, you were arrested for stealing food. So, tell me a little bit about that. - Yeah, that was the first day I got here actually. I wasn't aware of your customs here yet. You see, in the future, things like fruit, water, some vegetables, they're free in the market places. We have what's called nourishment centers where basically you're allowed up to three items at no cost. And fruit, you never have to pay for. So it was just a simple misunderstanding really. Oh, and water. I still can't get over the fact that you guys pay for water to be bottled up here. Your time makes history in so many ways. - After our interview, I found myself pretty amazed. I'm not saying I'm a believer at this point. I mean, anyone can make up a story, but I have to admit it. It's a pretty good story. After a few days went by, I thought of a million more questions I wanted to ask. I found myself wanting more, more information about the supposed future. And more importantly, I wanted to push for more proof, something that can point to the truth. I really wanted to know is this guy from the future or is it all just a story? So, I'm on my way to an interview with Sebastian and I've noticed something strange. Ever since I left the house, this same car has been following me. And I'm 100% sure it's the same car because when I stopped to get gas, it stopped. And then when I left, it followed. So it's either a coincidence or I'm being followed. Hey, hey. - Hey, how's it going? - How you doin'? - All right. - Hey, thanks for having us. You mind if I come in and use your restroom? Been driving for a long time. - Come on in. You can just give me everything in one big crash course more or less. - One big crash course, huh? Yeah, okay. There's gonna be several major wars. There's gonna be a World War that will change many things for your lifetime. It's gonna be between the US, the EU, China, Russia, and the Middle East, more specifically Iran. This war is going to be massive and there's another one starting right now with this coronavirus. This war will be known as the vaccine war. Billions of people refuse the vaccine and billions of people die as a result of it. There is no resolve, even through my time. This vaccine is a mandatory chip implant. By the time I was born, every child born into the corporation is required to have it. You can actually see the scar where I have mine. Feel it. - Yeah, yeah, I can feel. That's weird. - Everybody's required to have it. You can't travel, you can't go to school, you can't work, you can't do anything without this chip. At that point, you're basically a beneather. - What's a beneather? - Right. So the beneathers are the people that don't believe in the chip or the vaccine. They basically refuse it. They live beneath the cities in the abandoned tunnel systems. They're oftentimes referred to as the ones below. They refer to themselves as the believers, but to everyone else in society, they're known as the beneathers. They don't live long at all. They all live to about 40 years old. - Why do they die so young? - Nobody can live outside for years and years at a time without proper care. People need masks and respirators outdoors at all times. The air quality in my time is so poor that nobody can live out there for long. And that's why there's no more houses and everybody's required to live in pods. Pods are the only kind of living quarters that can protect us from the air pollutants. - Would you be willing to allow us to X-ray that chip in your hand so we can get a visual of it? We'd pay for it, of course. - You don't believe me, huh? - No, I'm not saying that at all, but visual proof of it would obviously substantiate your claim. - Set it up. - Yeah? - Absolutely. - His X-ray results proved exactly what he said. Although we can't determine the actual technology of the chip itself, Sebastian does in fact have a foreign object implanted in his hand. Now, this doesn't confirm at all his claims of being from the future, but he does have an object in his hand. I mean, perhaps it's all just part of his elaborate hoax. Not only did we get an X-ray from Sebastian, but he also agreed to have blood work done. If he's telling the truth about everyone in the future being born with various forms of metal oxides in their body, this test will easily determine that. What other things would you say are different in 3036 than they are now? - Well, I'll tell you this. You're as free as you're ever gonna get right now. These are considered the last days of freedom. Your kids won't even see it. So, soak it up because as simple minded as your time period is, you've got it pretty good. You just don't know it. - What's the population in 3036? - The world population? - Yeah. - Just over two billion people. You know what? You might actually be here when the big blackout happens. How old are you again? - 42. - So you'll be in your 70s by the time that happens. You might want to check out before then. - What's the big blackout? - The big blackout, if I'm not mistaken, happens in December 2052. Basically everything goes dark for upwards to five years. The internet, the power, it all gets disconnected on the account of what's called terrorists. But many speculate otherwise. Anyway. Five years, it's turmoil. Riots, you name it. It's pretty much one of the worst of times. It takes them upwards to 20 years to get the power back online. And even then, it's absolute chaos. Believe it or not, our zoo consists of animals like dogs and cats, rabbits, squirrels. These are considered exotic animals. All of the larger species like lions and tigers, cat species, the larger ones, elephants, they're all gone. The larger species no longer exist. We've got large areas, hundreds of miles, thousands of miles all designated to wind turbines, reflective mirrors, and solar panels. It's one of the few remaining jobs left for residents, but it's also the most dangerous. When children are first born, they're assigned partners which are called caring ones. These are basically small robots that monitor the child for health conditions. The caring ones are assigned with children up until the age 16 when they're legally able to have children. At times, the caring ones can be assigned for longer durations whether or not the children have mental instabilities, health issues, and other underlying conditions. These caretakers or robots are also allowed to detain civilians or residents as well. They read to the children, they teach the children. They basically do all of the duties of a parent and it's done like this for a reason. From birth, we're taught that these robots are just as important as your parents or siblings. There are no more schools like you know them to be today. Children are taught with AI. We're taught at a young age that all residents are equal, none being more important than the other. There's no more religion. Religious beliefs are strictly forbidden. The few people that still practice Christianity are forced to live with beneathers basically where there's no access to clean water, healthcare, and so on. For the most part, people just don't jeopardize it and no longer practice religion. Mating is much different. Residents without any illnesses are allowed to mate upwards of three times a year until impregnated. The female population is highly monitored. Male civilians are also put on hormone therapy drugs to regulate mating. If you're caught having children outside of the regulated time periods without a care taker or a caring one and without getting them vaccines, they're removed from the guardians and it's speculated that their either killed or used for food. There's no entertainment like you have today. We don't have movies, music, sports. There's no actors, no celebrities, nothing like that. The only form of entertainment we have is to read books. And if you're caught reading a book for any other purpose other than educational purposes, it's against the law. The United States as you know it today no longer exists. There's no more government. There's no more countries. Every country is under now what's called a corporation. The whole world is basically under three major corporations. We are under what's called the Rothschild's Corp. The merger of these three corporations changed it all. A company named Gavi which is a Bill Gates corporation, Amazon which you have today, which they merge and become Gavison. And then you've got the Rothschild's group. Those are your three major corporations. So what used to be the bigger nations like United States, Russia, China, they all fall under one corporation, the Rothschild's Corp. We don't celebrate many holidays anymore. We have one known as the Day of the United which was the merger of the three corporations. We have another which is called the Day of the Caring Ones which is the first day the robot was online and placed inside of residents' homes. There's a global currency now under the corporation. Everything is done via the bank and via this chip. - I just left my interview with Sebastian, and sure enough, that car is following me again. I sent Sebastian's hair off to two different companies for DNA analysis and the results are perplexing to say the least. The first record clearly shows no significant links to any DNA strands currently on record. Now if that wasn't strange enough, the second analysis from a completely different company has 0%'s all the way down the line. Not a single link. Basically, his bloodline couldn't be traced back to anyone in history. - Hello? - Sebastian, hi, it's Jack. I have something very interesting I want to talk to you about. Would you mind if we set up a time to talk again? - Jack, I'm sorry, I can't. I wasn't being completely honest with you about how I got here. Jack, I really can't talk about it. I'm sorry, I have to go. - Wait, wait, Sebastian, is everything okay? - Jack, I can't talk. I have to go. - Hello? Hello? Sebastian? He's not answering. - Hello? - Hello, yes, my name is Jack Helms. I'm calling about one of your tenants. His name is Sebastian. I haven't been able to reach him in over a week. - He never say anything to me. He never say anything to me. He just leave, he leave all his stuff. - Oh, really? Well if you see him, can you tell him that Jack Helms is looking for him? - Yeah, yeah, okay. - For the past week, every time I leave the house, I'm pretty sure I'm being followed. - Sheriff's deputies recovered a body. They say it is a male but they were not able to make a clear ID. - While there's no face to put with the story... - Human remains found in the thickly wooded area off Old Highway 20. - There's no face to put with the story, only belonging. - A real life mystery that today sits stored away in evidence bags. Around 8:00 this morning, a body was found. Police right now calling this a suspicious death investigation. - Although we can't confirm that this is in fact the remains of Sebastian, I did find it strange that the victim's left hand was missing. That would have been the hand he had the chip in. Also, Cypress Park where the victim was found was the same location I first met with Sebastian. So, why are we here? - I like it here. It's a good place to come and gather your thoughts. You know? - One thing I've been meaning to ask you. How did you get here? - It was just an accident. I didn't mean to come here. - By accident? What do you mean? - Well, I mean I didn't come here on purpose. - With all due respect, how does that happen? How does somebody accidentally time travel? - Turn off the camera. Turn it off. Okay, listen. We can't talk about that kinda stuff. Officially, the record is I got here by accident. Do you understand? I'm gonna tell you something, but it's completely off the record. By no means can you go around telling people what I'm about to tell you. - Okay. - 3036, that's it. That's the end. - Wait, what? - 3036 is the last year that humanity will exist. See, the earth ends for most living species every 6,300 years or so It's supposedly the Earth's natural cycle but that depends on who you ask. Mostly the beneathers but others too, they believe it's the return of the supreme race. You see, they believe the Anunnaki are returning. - The Anunnaki? - Right. The Anunnaki are the supreme race who live on what NASA has named Planet X, but we know it as Nibiru in my time. Your government already knows about this planet. They've already told you that. They just don't tell you the truth about it. See, the truth was kept from everyone for many years. Your government is fully aware of the supreme race, and I mean that as in today, current time. And this information doesn't actually surface for another 800 years or more. You see, that was the problem. It was kept alive for so long that it's hard for people to believe what's being told anymore. In the end, you probably won't ever know the truth. But as a wise man once said, history is nothing more than a set of lies agreed upon.
