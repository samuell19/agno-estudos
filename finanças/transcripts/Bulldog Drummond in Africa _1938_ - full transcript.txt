[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CLOCK DINGING] MAN: London newspaper. London newspaper. [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] Tenny! Coming, Captain Drummond. I took the liberty of putting a little brandy, that's all. Took the liberty of telling. That was an act of Christian kindness. I rather thought you might place it. Well, Tenny, this is our last day as a bachelor. Yes, sir. After today, we'll be a married men, sir. And if we're not, it won't be our fault this time. Uh, let's see. We've done everything Ms. Phyllis asked us to. We've stayed shut up in the house for days, no newspapers, no matters, no guns. Tenny, you did dispose off all the guns? Have you found it. There wasn't... Oh, yes, oh, yes, all the guns. Yes, I believe your... Take it, take it. [SNEEZES] [SIGHS] We're not catching cold, are we, sir? You can blame Algy if we are. It was his idea of taking away our trousers so we couldn't leave the house. It is a very effective idea if I may say so, sir. Tenny, he didn't leave a pair by any chance? Not even rompers, sir. They've all gone with the luggage. Except of course, the ones Mr. Longworth's bringing with him. And no money either. I hope Col. Nielson won't forget to bring that when he comes. Why Colonel Nielson can be reliable. And the tickets to Nice, who has them? Mr. Longworth, sir. What, Algy? Tickets and trousers both? Oh, that's quite a responsibility for one man. Especially for Mr. Longworth if I may say so, sir. I think I better check up on it, Tenny. Uh, pardon me, sir. We promised Ms. Phyllis that we wouldn't use the telephone except in emergency. This is an emergency, Tenny. Now supposing Algy brought the tickets and forgot the trousers. Can you imagine a honeymoon under circumstances like that? I can, sir. Rather what could I say, sir? Then we'll agree that this is an emergency? Oh, definitely, sir. That is if... Hello, exchange? Get me uh, four, four, four, four. [PHONE RINGS] Algy Longworth is in. Hello, are you there? Oh, it's you, old fella. Wedding? What wedding? My wedding, you blibbering idiot. Now, listen Algy, pay strict attention. Have you got the tickets? You bet I have. Right here in my pocket. Good. And now listen carefully, Algy, have you got my trousers? He has them. May I suggest that you inquired about mine? Yes, and have you got Tenny's trousers? Yes, he has them too. Thank you, sir. Oh and Algy. Algy, have you got your own trousers? Have I got my own trousers? Now, you old boy, I... Uh oh! You... I forgot to put them on. What'll I do? MAN: Captain Drummond is on the wire, sir. All right, put him through. Hello, Hugh, what do you want now? Yes, of course, I've got your money and the marriage license. Yes. I simply thought it might be a good idea to-- All you have to do is to stay inside that house of yours and keep out of trouble. What? I simply asked if you are certain if this wedding isn't dragging you away from some important case. No, there's not a thing on my desk. You can stick your long, unwanted, interfering nose into you, Drummond. And you're supposed not to talk on the telephone, goodbye. Hello? Of course, it's Phyllis. Hugh, darling... You promised not to use the telephone. Has anything happened? No, no, no, darling. I just wanted to know if... If she has the rings, sir. Yes. Have you got the rings? Of course, I've got the rings. Now will you behave yourself and do as you've been told? Ah but, sweetheart, I am. She has the rings. And if I don't get out of this place soon, I'll go crazy. Pardon me, sir. We shall go crazy, sir. Yes, we shall go crazy. I'm leaving right now to pick up Colonel Nielson from the Graystone manor. We'll be there in no time at all. Of course, I love you. [KISSES] Bye. Goodbye, sweetheart. Well, Tenny, she's on her way. Nothing can stop us now. This time, we're going to be married. It would seem so, sir. If self sacrifice has been there, Tenny, staying shut up here for days, weeks, years, centuries. But it's worth it, Tenny, it's worth it. I dare say so. - May I make a suggestion, sir? - Certainly, what is it? - The telephone, sir. - Yes, what about it? It might be the one weakling in an otherwise invincible thing, sir. You're right, Tenny. We might be lured into something over the wire. Precisely, sir. Ah, thank you. - Now we are protected. - Not totally, sir. - Hmm? - Watch. May I further suggest, sir? Ah, an excellent idea, Tenny. I know all my leggings, sir. Phyllis. Phyllis, where are you? MAN: Colonel Nielson. Good evening, Colonel. Oh! And who are you? I'm afraid Scotland Yard is slipping. You've didn't wear a beard when you ran away and your face is darker. It's the African sun. The African sun... I see. In the photographs in our files, you were a much younger man. Richard Lane. Some kind of an ex-diplomat. Decorated by the clown during the war for services of unusual merit. [CHUCKLES] The clown made a mistake. [LAUGHS] So you do remember me. Scotland Yard never forgets a spy until he is shot. Oh, Colonel, let's avoid the unpleasant words. - Won't you join me? - Oh, how nice of you. May I suggest the sherry, you'll find that excellent. Oh, fine. Aren't you a bit curious as to why I'm here? No, no, no, no, no. You've undoubtedly come all the way from Africa to give yourself up. [LAUGHS] Scarcely that. Well, perhaps you've come to return the plans of the Benton bomber. Which you auctioned off to an enemy government 12 years ago. My, you have an excellent memory, Colonel. So they tell me. I suppose it's surprising that you, a fox, comes hunting for the hound. You doubt a six pay to get away? Oh, yes, yes, of course. You see, had I called upon you at the Yard, the odds would have been to great even for me. - Hmm, I dare say it. - Oh, yes, yes. Will you excuse me for a moment? Hmm. - Hey, wait a moment. - I'm sorry, Colonel. I'm only trying to help you, here's the key. Oh, my apologies. [SCOFFS] Lucks must have turned against me. You ought to know that all important papers are kept in the Yard. Yes, I should have thought about that. You were preparing to attend Captain Drummond's wedding, weren't you? How do you know about Drummond's wedding? Your man Phillips is quite informative. It'll simplify things a great deal if you are equally so. And if I retain my clam like silence? Won't you sit down? You service men are all alike. Pretty much the same in spirit. Admirable too, in a way. Now, you for example, remind me of Commander Knox, when I requested information about the 18 inch coast gun. So, you were responsible for his disappearing. Yes. Many great nations will pay money for each other's war secrets. Really? A great deal of money. Now is that a fact, Colonel, that your government had designs for a radio-wave disintegrator which will make it impossible for for an enemy to decept your signals during time of war. - I haven't heard of it. - Oh, come, come. About a signal apparatus. I went to buy one of the Yard's own radio technicians. You know all about it. You're going to tell me. And just how do you propose to make me tell you? If your persistent be an obstinate, Colonel, I'm afraid you'll be late for Captain Drummond's wedding. [HONKS] [DOOR BELL BUZZES] - Good evening. - Good evening. I'd called for Colonel Nielson. - And you are? - Ms. Clavering. Oh, yes, yes, of course, Ms. Clavering. - Where's Phillips? - Well, this is Phillip's night out. - His night out? - Yes. Cinema, I believe. I talked to him a little while ago. Must've been all of a sudden. It was rather sudden. Well, I'm in a fight for hurry. I wonder if you'd be good enough to tell the Colonel I'm here. Ms. Clavering, perhaps I should explain, you see... I'm the new tenant of Graystone manor. The new tenant? Yes. But I talked to the Colonel only this morning. And he didn't tell you? No! Well, that's strange. Of course, the Colonel's a busy man, but, he turned the place over to me today. And he's not here? No, he's gone to Wokingham lodge to be with Captain Drummond. Then I must hurry. Ms. Clavering, since we're going to be neighbors, I do hope to see more of you and Captain Drummond. - You know about the wedding? - Yes, the Colonel told me and... May I offer my good wishes. Thank you. You mind if I ask you something? No, not at all. I have the strangest feeling of having known you before. No, I hardly think so. I couldn't have forgotten so charming an acquaintance. That's very nice of you. Goodnight. Goodnight, Ms. Clavering. Hello? Get me Captain Drummond at Wokingham lodge. Hurry, please. [BEEP] They must answer, someone's there, I know. Try again. [BAGPIPES PLAYING] [LAUGHING] Louder, Tenny, louder. Oh! I know it, sir. I know. A wee...of high... Oh, Tenny, attempt to paint my every wish. With the perfume of the pepper in every drop, sir. - Well, I do believe you're a poet. - Thank you, Sir. And a good fella. Well, you're not so bad yourself, sir. Thank you. Well, Tenny, since it's our last day as a bachelor, - so we drink to-- - Ms. Phyllis, sir? - I. - And to bonnie..., sir. [HORN TOOTING] That's Algy. Our pants! Ready, Tenny? [PLAYING BAGPIPES] Come on. [HUMMING TUNE] - Darling! - Hugh, something terrible-- - Who, me? - It's the Colonel. - He's gone. - With my money, that scoundrel. He's been kidnapped. Do you hear that, Tenny? Somebody stole the Colonel. Great... What liberty is next? Generals? - A man with a beard. - And a cast in one eye. Oh, Hugh, please be serious. Thee were two men. One with a beard, I couldn't see the other one. Oh no, darling, you've got things all mixed up. I'm the one who finds bearded villains, not you. Oh, Tenny, you believe me, don't you? Oh... That is uh... [LAUGHS] We stay in the house and try to keep out of mischief and now you come along... I know, you've got him hidden in the car. - Hugh... - Well, where is he? I told you. I stopped at Graystone to pick him up. And the man with the beard said he was the new tenant. Oh, Colonel Nielson wouldn't let Graystone to anyone. He said the Colonel had come on here. - But I went back and watched. - Good work, darling. They brought Colonel Nielson knocked unconscious. They took him away in his own car. - Away? Where? - I don't know. I tried to phone you. I cut the wires. - Tenny. - Coming, sir. As usual, coming, sir. Your hat, sir. What's that? Mr. Longworth removed our firearms, sir. So I took the precaution of hiding these. [CLEARING THROAT] Tenny, you said there were no guns in the house. Pardon me, sir, but these are not guns. These are pistols. See, darling, we kept our word. Good work, Tenny. Hurry, Hugh, hurry. I say, Hugh, this... I thought your pants are... I mean, where are you going? DRUMMOND: - Graystone manor. - Graystone manor? [TIRE BURSTS] Oh! You look in there, Tenny. - I'll look in there. - You'll come with me. There's the Colonel's briefcase. Hello, operator? It's Captain Drummond speaking from Colonel Nielson's residence. Will you get me Scotland Yard immediately? Yes. Yes, you can call me here. PHYLLIS; Hugh, look. - Tenny! - Coming, sir. Easy now. Captain Drummond. Phillips, old man, who did this? - It was Richard... - Yeah. This will help, sir. [PHONE RINGS] Drummond speaking. Yard? Yes, get me Inspector Blair, quickly. Who was it, Phillips, can't you tell me? It's Richard Lane. Richard Lane? Now I know why his face was so familiar. I remember his picture in the papers, without a beard. That nuisance has been after him for years. Hello, Blair, this is Drummond. I'm at Nielson's. He's been kidnapped. I said kidnapped. Yes, by Richard Lane. I don't care if Lane hasn't been in England for years, he was here, half an hour ago. Captain Drummond. Just hold on a moment. Yes, Phillips. Caught an airplane. - in Hampton Heath... - DRUMMOND: Yes. They're taking him to... Where, Phillips, where? To Africa. Somewhere near Arby. Morocco. Hello, Blair? The butler says Lane has a plane on Hampton Heath. Yes, they're taking Nielson to Morocco, somewhere near Arby. Yes, Morocco. Now, do sent some men to the Heath. If I get there on time, I'll try to stop him. Right. Isn't there something we can do? We can get the men who killed him. Come on now. Now where are you going? TENNY: Hampton Heath, sir. Hampton Heath? I wish you make up your mind to where you are going to get married. You think he'll be all right? Yes, of course he'll be all right. Hey, look. Their plane. They've seen us. Well, it wasn't a bad idea, Tenny. It wasn't a good one, sir. Hugh... Hugh, you're crazy. I mean, are you crazy? - Are those my pants now? - Yes, but... - Never mind, later. - But, listen-- Never mind, Algy. Here you are, Tenny. Please excuse me, darling. But, Hugh, I'm in a jitter. Have you gone slightly barmy? Mad, if that's what you mean. Mad? Oh, you mean angry, annoyed, irritated as well. What about it? The plane, Algy. Colonel Nielson's in it. - What's he doing up there? - Kidnapped, Algy, kidnapped. Kidnapped? Nielson? Actually, are you sure you're quite all right? I mean, the wedding... Of course, I'm all right, Algy. Drain Phyllis with it. She started it. Phyllis? I saw the men with Colonel Nielson in his car. What for? We're going to follow and find out. [HORN TOOTING] Who's that? [HORN TOOTING] Police? Don't say anything about trying to follow or they might try to stop us. - Captain Drummond. - Hello, Sergeant. The Yard calls on the wire, sir. It's too bad you didn't get here five minutes earlier, there's your man up there. There's the car that was used to abduct Colonel Nielson. You better take a look at it. Right, sir. I'll go try to get away, Algy. Tenny... TENNY: - Coming, sir. - Hugh... Where are we going? Possibly Africa. Africa? Tenny, get those doors open, please. Very good, sir. Algy, you go check that reserve tank. Okay. [WHISTLES] Oh, Captain Drummond. Just a moment, sir. Hello, Sergeant. You people are just in time, sir. - Time for what? - To carry out orders, sir. Orders, Sergeant? Yes, sir. You do not leave England tonight. You mean to tel me I can't take my plane for a flight if I want to? Orders, sir. The Yard wants no interference in handling a certain case. Oh, we're just going for a pleasure flight with a few friends, you know? [STAMMERING] Up in the clouds. You know, good for asthma, that sort of thing. [COUGHS] - Yes, you see? - Sorry, sir. Orders is orders. Jenkins, you'll remain here until relieved. Okay, Sergeant. This plane is not to be taken out. Understand? This plane is not to be taken out. Excuse me. - I say, Hugh-- - Later, Algy, later. Algy, open the parachute box. - But the chutes are in the-- - In the box, where they belong. In the box? Yes, Algy, in the box. Locked in the box. Oh, that's right, isn't it? Locked in the box. Yeah. I'll see if they're still there. - Goodbye, darling. - Hugh. Don't try anything, he's the law. I've got to, darling, it's our only chance. If you're that crazy, I'll be crazy too. I'm going with you. - You're staying here. - I'm not. This was supposed to be our wedding night. - But you've forgotten. - I know, darling, I'm sorry. I love you and I want to marry you and I'm going to marry you. But not tonight, now, please get in the car and run along. All right, I suppose I'll have to. Goodbye and be careful. Good girl. [CLEARS THROAT] Uh... - Smoke, Constable? - Not when I'm on duty, sir. Oh, I beg your pardon. I only made sure there were no hard feelings. [LAUGHS] Oh, I understand, sir, thank you, sir. You wouldn't mind if we inspect our parachute as long as we're here? Well, those will be all right, sir? If you have any doubts, you can come and watch it. [LAUGHS] Oh, that's all right, sir, not that I don't trust you, but... - Orders is orders. - That's right, sir. Orders is orders. [LAUGHS] Thank you. [STRUGGLING] What's the matter, Algy. Oh, there's something stuck down there I simply can't get it up. Why, I'm ashamed of you, Algy, a big, strong fellow like you. [SQUEALING] [SIGHS] I guess you're right, Algy, this thing's stuck. Lend me a hand. [STRUGGLING] I suppose we must give it up. [LAUGHS] Oh, don't say "give up," gentlemen. Let me give you a hand. Oh, no, no. Don't bother, Constable, you might sprain yourself. [LAUGHS] Nonsense, they used to call me little Goliath. - No. - Now, you watch me. [CHUCKLES] Hey... Hey, you can't do that. Let me out. [BANGS] - Next box. - Excuse... - Ready? - Ready, sir. [BANGING CONTINUES] And this, Algy, was to have been my wedding night. - Well, Hugh, that reminds me... - What? This was to have been your wedding night. That's what I said. Well, that's when I heard it. [CHUCKLES] There are times, Algy, when silence is... - Golden? - Yes. When silence is golden. That's what Tenny said. Oh, I see. And you mean that this is one of those times, huh? Emphatically. I hated running out on Phyllis like that but, we couldn't bring her with us. Of course, not. Danger and all that sort of thing, you know. Pardon me, sir. Your gun, sir. Oh, yes, certainly. [LAUGHS] Jolly business, right. It depends upon the point of view, sir. - I say, Hugh... - Yes, Algy? Can we depend on that thing? Yes, Algy. Algy, it's about 1,200 miles. We should reach the African coast by dawn, avoiding accidents. Accidents? Hugh, you haven't had a crash yet, have you? There can always be a first time, Algy. Oh, of course, of course, a first time... What! Don't worry, old boy. I think we'll get through on that. PHYLLIS: I hope. ALGY: Ms. Phyllis! DRUMMOND: Darling! I know I shouldn't but, here I am. Here we are. [LAUGHING] ALGY: This is a surprise. Here, sit down. Well, darling, now you're in the soup with the rest of us. Nice soup. I've often wondered about it and now I know. - What? - Why I love you. You think we could be married in Morocco? Or would they make us use a Mohammedan priest? Well, then, we'd be Mohammedas and I could have a harem. That would be lovely. But don't try it. And here we go. You better fasten your belt. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] What? [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] - Welcome to Arby. - Thank you. - Have your landing permit? - Huh? Landing permit, old boy. - Oh, landing permit! - Si, senor. Well,you see, we left England rather hurriedly. Oh, you must have a landing permit. We'll arrange for it with the consulate. Oh, the captain is attached to the consulate? No, not exactly but I'm sure that they'll see that everything is in order. The consulate will not open its door for several hours, senor. In that case, we'll take a look around the town. Oh, that will not be possible, senor, until later. - Oh, I see, not until later. - Si, senor. Uh, shall we, Algy? ALGY: I don't think so. [SIGHS] We're losing our grip, Algy. Arby has a hotel, no doubt. Hotel? Si, senor. The Hotel De Maroc. We'll escort you there. Yes, I thought perhaps you would. After you. No, after you, senor. After you. Welcome to Arby, darling. Romantic, isn't it? If the heat of an African sun can be classed as romantic, sir. - Right you are. - Right you are. Right you are. [PHONE BEEPS] Yes? MAN: Mr. Lane's here to see you, sir. - Let him come in. - Yes, Major. Ah! - Good morning, Charles. - Major. - Sit down, sit down. - Thank you. You're quite a stranger. Yes, I rarely leave my place, you know. Pretty much of a hermit. Don't you find life a bit dull in that country place of yours? As a mater of fact, Major, that's why I'm here. I've decided to have a little fling. London, Paris... Paris. Yes, it's been over the years since I was away. I'll enjoy it, I think. I wish I could go with you. [LAUGHS] I wish you could, Major. And oh, yes, by the way, of course, I'll need a visa for my passport. Oh, that's easy. Just see MacAllister across the hall. Fine, thank you. Well, goodbye, Major. Goodbye, son. I wish you a pleasant journey. Thank you. [PHONE BEEPS] Yes? Captain Drummond is here to see you, sir. - Well, send him in. - Yes, sir. - That door, Captain. - Thank you. Would you mind waiting here? Certainly not, senor. Captain Drummond. I'm glad you know me, Major Gray. - Sit down. - Thank you. Drummond... You stand in danger of arrest by the local authorities for landing here without a permit. Yes, it's about arranging for a permit that I'm here. Consulate regulations state, that all subjects of the empire, shall receive any assistance which they may stand in need. The Scotland Yard has cabled me to assist you according to regulations. That's very decent of them. Furthermore, the Yard has ordered me to assist you back to England in double quick time. - Major, you don't understand. - I understand perfectly. I've ordered your plane service and the moment it's ready, off you go. You're lucky we're not leaving you in Moroccan jail for a few weeks. - But, Major... - Just a moment, please. MAN: Yes, Major? Has a guard accompanied Captain Drummond? - Yes, Major. - Ask him to step into the hall. Very good, sir. - Major, when I left England-- - I know all about you, Drummond. You left England in defiance of official order. After resisting an officer of the crown. That constable didn't know I was coming to Arby. But Scotland Yard did. Captain Drummond is returning to England. He's not to leave this hotel without... from me and under escort. Si, senor. See here, Major, I tell you Colonel Nielson was kidnapped. Rubbish, Drummond. The Yard warned me you'd say something like that. Cable them again, ask them if he's in his office. Well, Major, I'm off. Well, goodbye, sir and good luck. - Thank you. - Just a moment. - You're Richard Lane. - You're mistaken, Drummond. Mistaken, my eye, Major, this man is Richard Lane. He's withered Nielson's butler, kidnapped Nielson. This is the man I followed in my plane. - That's enough, Drummond. - But, Major, I... This gentleman is Mr. Charles Omega. To my knowledge, he hasn't been out of Arby for a year. My apologies, sir. I hope you'll overlook this. It's perfectly all right, Major. Good day, sir. Major, that man was in England last night. Captain Drummond, you will be notified when your plane is serviced. - Good morning. - Yes, good morning. After you, senor. Thank you. Do you think Lane knows we're on to him, sir? I'm certain he doesn't. - Is McTurk back yet? - No, not yet, sir. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Well, what do you want? I'm afraid these will have to be burned. McTurk! That's a perfect disguise. Too perfect, Major. Well, what did you find out? They've got Nielson, all right. I wasn't a 100 yards away when that plane came down. - Lane's plane, of course. - Right. I fetched you...message. And scouted around the house about a quarter of a mile away. And I waited for three or four hours and just as I was about to give up, I caught a flash of light. ...got a signal from one of the upper windows. What does his message say? "Safe so far. Lane expecting three of his agents. Delay raid until tonight." I don't like it. These are his orders. He's gambling his life and I won't risk it. Fordine, you made arrangements with the local police for the raid as I told you? No, Major. Well, why haven't you? Because there will be no raiding. What's the meaning of this? So, will you gentlemen, please raise your hands? What? I wouldn't try that if I were you. There's a corner there, Major. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Ah! [LAUGHS] Have you found your quarters comfortable, Colonel? Quite. The confinement is becoming a little monotonous. Yes, yes, I understand perfectly. If you come with me, perhaps, I can relieve that monotony. Are you uh, wondering about your chances of escape? Naturally. You're too smart, at least I hope you are to attempt it. Oh, thank you. After you, Colonel. As you say. [ANIMALS GROWLING] Have a kingdom of my own, Colonel. You know, far from the maddening crowd and things like that. Hello, Booboo. Mimi. Her house... - Is that... - Yes. [GROWLING] [LAUGHS] - My pets, Colonel. - Your pets? Yes, yes, I find them extremely useful. Yes, I imagine they do discourage visitors. Oh, no, no. The contrary. They welcome visitors. Do you follow me? - Yes, I follow you. - I thought you would. Now, this fellow over here, he's a favorite, but... We mustn't go too close. Oh, don't worry, I won't. [GROWLING] Gentlemen, I have a surprise for you. Allow me to present our old opponent, Colonel Nielson. How's it going? - Colonel... Acris. - Charmed. Delighted. Acris is the agent who obtained from your government the plans for the Sudan. Which was changed immediately, rendering them valueless. Yes, but not before we sold them. Had a very nice figure. Really? Very clever, I'm sure. - And this is Dr. Stern. - Doctor. How do you do? Baron Nevsky. Oh, uh, have all arrangements been made for Captain Drummond's departure? Yes, sir. All arranged. Drummond's plane will explode in mid air. That means that Captain Drummond and his party will vanish at about 100 miles at sea. Have you nothing to say, Colonel? You underestimate Captain Drummond's ability. You know, Nielson, I rather admire you. I think under different circumstances, we could get along well together. The circumstances what as you say, have to be... - Different. - Oh, yes, of course, different. - Colonel. - Thank you. To a very courageous opponent. Courageous, even in defeat. And may I in the depth of my defeat offer a toast? Why, surely. To men, who have lost all sense of honor, to men, who have disgraced the countries that gave them birth, uh... To you, gentlemen. After dinner, we will discuss Colonel Nielson's toast... In detail. Have a chair, Colonel. Thank you so much. I'd hate to be in this plane, when this thing goes off. What time are we setting it for? Fordine said, "At 9 o'clock." [MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE LAUGHING AND CHATTERING] I say, Hugh, those dancing fellas are doing some pretty nifty tailspin. Algy, now is not the time to become analytical about whirling durbses. - Whirling durbses... - Yes, whirling durbses... Now, lend a hand with those sheets. Oh, yeah. Be sure to tie the knots double because we can't use broken legs. But, Hugh, how are we going to find Lane's place, after which-- Well, that is if we do get out of here. We'll worry about that when we get out. If Lane has a place, Algy, we'll find it. - And Colonel Nielson too. - Right. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] That's Phyllis, I hope. - Did you hear? - "Si." They are up to something. ...you're the most suspicious one. - Good work, darling. - I'm rather active person. I still don't think it's long enough to reach the ground. Now, Algy, we can work our way along that ledge it'll reach from the balcony. Yeah. And only 50 feet to a nice courtyard below. Now if you want to know what I'm in favor of doing... - What? - I'm in favor of trying it. That's what I thought. And, darling, promise me something. - Yes, dear. - I want you to stay here. - But... - And not try to follow us.. But... There'll be no buts, darling. You stay here or else... - Or else what? - Or else I'll thrash you. Yes, Captain Drummond. But don't try it. Bye now. Here we go. You next, Algy and then Tenny. Be careful, Hugh. - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - [SHUSHES] Come back here, there's someone at the door. Delay them. Tell them I'm in the bath or something. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Why did you take so long? I was attending Captain Drummond. - The Captain is uh... - In his bath. Ah, then we will wait. [GREETING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Senor Fordine. Of the British Consul. How do you do? Good evening. If you don't mind, I'll wait for the Captain. Yes, of course. We were just listening to the music. [STAMMERING] Yeah and jolly good music too. They sound just like... Like music. [LAUGHING] And music is better if I open the window. Oh, no. [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] - Yes, yes. - Have a drink. You too, Consul boy. Have a drink. I'll just get get it all out. We saw Captain Drummond go into that room, did we not? "Si." With the others. - Did we see him come out? - No. That gentleman says he was in his bath. - That is so. - Cannot be so. Why? There's one bathroom on each floor. And the bathroom, it is not in there. It is down there. Then if he's not there, he must be there. And yet they say he did not. Then is he or is he not in his room? Something very, very strange. So... We shall see. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [GREETING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Where is Captain Drummond? TENNY: I've already told you, Captain Drummond is in his bath. Bath? [LAUGHS] It is no all right if my guest just has a bath? There is no bath, senor. There is no bath! Not in here. Over there. - Search the floor. - [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Here, here, here, here... Stand aside. Ha! So... Yeah, quite so. [DISTANT CHEERING] And what, senor, is this for? Climbing out. Well, darling. Good evening, Captain Drummond. I can't agree with you but we won't argue the point. I have Major Gray's instructions-- Yes, I know. And Mr. Fordine, Ms. Clavering. This gentleman has come to escort us to our plane and out of Morocco. - I'm sorry, sir. - Well, here we go. But, Hugh, we can't leave without Colonel Nielson. Oh, you need to have no fears about Colonel Nielson, Ms. Clavering. I suppose he's safe at his office in London? Yes, we've received a cable gram from Scotland Yard, assuring us that Colonel Nielson did spend the day in his office. As usual. As usual. But he couldn't. I saw those men carry him out of the house. Yes, I know, darling, but this gentleman says he spent the day in his office as usual. - But, Hugh-- - I have no choice, darling. My ship is in order? Oh, perfect order, Captain. Get your coat, darling. Captain Drummond, you will fly directly to England. Well, there seems to be no point in doing anything else if Colonel Nielson's there. - Well then, goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye, senores. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Come along, Algy. - Uh, goodbye. - Oh, goodbye, old boy. I hope I don't see you again. Well, that is unless we happen to meet. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Nice peoples. Too bad they could not get the landing permit. Oh, don't forget about it, an hour or so. [BOMB TICKING] You don't believe Nielson's in England? Of course, I don't. Then why have we been flying after sea for the past half hour? - Monkey business, Algy. - Monkey business? In case our Mr. Fordine decided to follow us. - So, we're turning back. - Turning back? Right now, we caught engine trouble. They wouldn't ask us to come down and see in a land plane, would they? Or let's not ask them, huh? If we're returning, sir, might I suggest that we land somewhere near Mr. Richard Lane's place? That's easier said than done, Tenny, we don't know where it is. Oh, but we do, sir. I made inquiries when we had stopped. As for the residence of Mr. Charles Omega. Mr. Richard Lane to us, sir. Good work, Tenny. I rather thought you might like it, sir. I've indicated it on this travel tooler. - "X" marks the spot, eh? - Yes, sir. [BOMB TICKING] The place is just there, sir. An end of a... Good, here go the flares. If anyone's watching those flares will be a dead give-away. I'll take that chance, darling. The moment we land, everybody get out and run. We'll soon know if they've spotted us. We were supposed to be well out at sea when that happened. Instead of which we're less than a mile from Lane's house. That's as close as you're going to get, my love. Tenny, you stay here with Ms. Phyllis. - Very good, sir. - Hugh-- - Right here. - But-- No arguments now. - Yes, sir. - That's better. Take my gun. Our guns if you will remember, my love, were confiscated by the police. Not all of them, Ms. Phyllis. If you wouldn't mind just turning your head for a second? I carried this, just in case. Good work, Tenny. Brilliant idea. I'd rather like a gun. Goodbye, darling. Somehow or rather we're always saying goodbye. Let's hope this will be the last time. Let's hope it won't. Take good care of her, Tenny. With my life, sir. Try to be safe, darling. Come on, Algy. Be careful, Hugh. [LION GROWLING] Sit down. Transmit this under code file... Well, you enjoyed your dinner? The condemned man... - Ate a hearty meal. - [LAUGHS] That's Colonel Nielson, gentlemen. A sense of humor in the face of death. Now I suppose you are ready to tell us about the radio-wave disintegrator? Well, if I have to die, I don't see that I gain much by it. That's right. Doubly right to make it more emphatic. Are you suggesting a bargain? For my life? Most decidedly. Well, of course, if I were to turn you loose, that would mean that I have to establish new headquarters. Very difficult thing to do. I have something you want. Now you can sell this disintegrator idea for millions. Enough to buy a dozen places like this. Yes, that's true, but... What assurance have I that you're telling the truth? Well, what assurance have I that you'll try...dead. That's a choice you have to take. Is that final? It's final. You may proceed. [GROWLING IN THE DISTANCE] In the uh... The radio-wave disintegrator, there's a means by which the signals, either voice or dot and dash code, are reversed in transmission. The low frequencies becoming high frequencies. And vice versa. There's nothing new to that, Colonel. On the contrary, a single word transmitted in normal code, in forms of a shaving station, a...wave combination being used in this special transmission. How does it sound, doctor? I'll ask a few questions, please. And let's hope Colonel that you have the correct answers. We promised not to follow them, miss. Well, I just can't stay here doing nothing. Of course, miss, if you decided to have a little stout around. I'd have to follow you, wouldn't I? A excellent idea, Tenny. Come along. That's my... [CHUCKLES] And you cannot explain the means by which the transpose singles are separate from the fluctuating...waves. Unfortunately, no. Doctor, what do you think? The gentleman's lying. RICHARD: Yes, I was afraid so. [WHISPERING] Shall we? Not a chance, Algy, Wait. You put very little value on your life, Colonel. It was worth a try. I'm wondering if you'd tell the truth to save three lives. I have only one. I'm referring to your friend, Major Gray and is assistant McTurk. How you know about Gray and McTurk? I have them upstairs. Their lives depend on you. Now I'll drive the bargain. Furnish us with information Dr. Stern says you're holding and I guarantee that you and your friends will be released within a week. [LAUGHS] By whom, may I ask? Local police. They'll be informed. May I think it over? Okay, you have exactly five minutes. Five minutes. [GROWLING] Hugh, Hugh, I don't think we better go that way. Quiet, Algy. Lion's chained, come on. [ELECTRONIC BEEPING] I say, Hugh, he's not at all bad looking when he's asleep, is he? Quiet, Algy. Lend me a hand here. Oh, yes. That ought to hold him, huh? I think so, Algy. We can use this. [LION GROWLING] Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh. Close the door, Algy. Major, Major Gray. Major Gray. Still disobeying orders, Drummond. Carry on. This chap's in pretty bad shape. See for some water around here, Algy. [GROWLING] Your pets seem a little restless tonight. Yes. And hungry. [GROWLING CONTINUES] Well, Colonel, have you decided? Not yet. In that case, perhaps we can assist you. This way, please. [GROWLS] Right. [WHIPS] [GROWLS] All right, gentlemen, stand back. I am... Colonel. You can still save yourself by telling the truth. All right, watch. Go from the back there. Get them. Behind. Stay here, Algy. I'm going to figure out how to sneak up on them. All right, old boy. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on out, Drummond. [LION GROWLING] [SCREAMS] Over there, Captain Drummond. Captain Drummond. Captain... Oh, here he comes, come. Fine fellow, Drummond. I rather like him, sir. [LIVELY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING]
