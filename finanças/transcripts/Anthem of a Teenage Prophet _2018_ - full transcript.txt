Shit, shit. - Hey, um, excuse me, excuse me! Hi, Lance Winters from WDFD. Did you just say that that young man knew? - Hi, Luke. - What time will we be on? - Well, I can't promise you guys that this will air. Even if the four of you corroborated, who's to say you guys are telling the truth? I need proof. - What's it worth to you? - Luke, I'm Lance Winters from WDFD. Look, I'm sorry about what happened to your friend. I know this must be hard for you, but I'd like to talk. Open the goddamn door. I only need a minute, Luke. What are you looking at me for? Go, go, set up, set up. - And we do have an update on that traffic accident that happened this morning. Unfortunate, there was a fatality. Jeez. That's horrible. No names have been released. Apparently there was a skateboarder involved. Please, drive carefully this morning, folks. - Mrs. Hunter, hi. I'm Lance Winters from WDFD. Do you have any comment on the incident today involving your son, the incident from this morning? Just-- - Luke! Luke! Luke! No! God! No! Luke! My baby. God. - Stan's dead. Stan, Stan. Stan. - No. I'm sorry, honey. - I have to go. - God. I'm so sorry. I gave you the one with the real sugar. - Thank you. - Honey, you didn't have anything to do with Stan dying, did you? Okay, Okay. And then, the news truck outside is-- what's that about? Yeah. God. Well, my yoga class was full today. That was good. And there was this elderly lady who let out a volcanic fart in the middle of the class I was trying not to bust a rib from laughing so hard. A miner whose name is being withheld pending notification of next of kin was killed this morning when he was struck by a van. But this wasn't just another deadly traffic accident. Today's tragic events were predicted in stark detail last night by local teen, Luke Hunter. On the way to school, one of you is going to get hit by a van-- and-- and-- die. Out of state plates. Blood on the sidewalk. - And while the video's authenticity has yet to be verified, Luke Hunter has refused requests for an interview. The teen's startling premonition was caught on tape at a friend's home the night before the accident. It would seem that for now, Stokum's own prophet of death is keeping all his predictions to himself. This is Lance Winters on the scene for WDFD. - You're smoking pot? - Seriously? - Doug, you're missing the point. - I wasn't even friends with him. - Luke, honey, just go up and get him. - No. - Here he comes. - Good. - Hey, Todd. - Hey, Mr. Hunter. - Yeah, been a while. - Hi, honey. - Hi, Mary. Those are cool. I dig those. - I make these. - Really? - Yeah. Why don't you take these. It has good energy. - Thank you. - It's always difficult when a young person dies. We want to focus on that life that ended too quickly when life is taken from us... - Luke? How were you able to predict Stan's death? Is it something you've always been able to do? Have you had any more predictions that you're just not telling us about, Luke? Luke? - You've seen those nature videos where the cameraman gets too close to the mama and her cubs, yeah? - Come on. - Have a blessed day. - Look who it is-- profit of death in the flesh. - What I don't get is, if you knew about Stan, why didn't you stop it? - Go for it, freak.

All the time. Ever killed anybody because of it? - Look, I spend my time, my life looking out on this road, thinking all sorts of crazy thoughts. I imagine a deer jumping out, car swerving into my lane, trees falling over just as I'm about to pass. Point is, I can't swerve like a madman, convinced the worst is going to happen.

Yeah, I'm sure the smoke helps. - No, please. I'm actually really glad I found you guys. My sister flaked on me, like, the second we got there. Probably went to bang her douchebag boyfriend in his douchebag truck. It's my fault. I should've have asked her to come. I got the tickets for Stan and me. - My tickets were for Stan and I too. - Weird. You doing good back there, Fang? - Fine. - I know this sounds weird, but do you think Stan was looking down no us tonight and maybe brought us together somehow? - Shit. - Fang?

Where are you folks coming from? - We're trying to get to Stokum. - Well, you're not getting to Stokum tonight. Maybe tomorrow. You can turn around up here. Take it easy. Drive safe. I'm gonna call my parents. - Do you have any money? - For what? - For gas, Faith. - Why? - Because she just drove us. Do you have cash or not? Fang? - In my jacket. - Thank you. What's wrong with you. Luke. She's Stan's girl. - I'm aware. Think I should go for it? Don't you just love me? - Fang! - Tell me you love me. Tell me you love me. - My God. - Hey. - Hey. - You talk to your parents? - Yeah. - I mean, my dad's upset that I'm at a random hotel with two guys. - For gas. - Thank you. But he's happy that I'm safe. - Good. You probably don't want to go back there. - Why not? Is he taking a bath? - Apparently.

Luke? - Just drop it, OK? - No, talk to me. - I'm not him. I will never be him. Stan was an amazing guy, and he's dead. He's dead, Faith. - Yeah, you don't think I know that? - I'm just a loser! He didn't bring us together. You're just hanging out with me because you're sad and lonely. - And you're not? Screw you! I thought we were having fun together.

You think you killed my Johnny? - I tried to stop it. Every time, I do, I just screw it up. - One thing I know, we all gonna die. Nothing no one could do. Another thing I know, it's God who decides when we go, not the little boy down the street. My Johnny is a proud man, stubborn man. He's gonna do what he's gonna do, but he die happy. He live good life. Now, you rest. I make you cup of tea. - Hey Faith! I'm sorry.

We gotta go right now. - No. We gotta go. - No. Get up. - Why? - Here. Get dressed. Come on, get dressed. - Dude. Come on, you're really losing it! What'd I do? - I saw it. You're losing it. You thought you could kill yourself and I wouldn't know? - You're really losing it. - That's funny. - These prophecies and shit. - I'm losing it? it's not real, it's not real. - Look at me, look at me. - It's not real! - Look at me. I know what's going on. No, no, no, no, no. I know what's going on. - You have no clue. You have no clue. The intervention is supposed to be next week. - Yeah, hilarious.

Concentrate, pick a route. - You want me to fall, or do you want me to jump? That would be pretty spectacular. - Hey, look at me. Up then down. That's it. You're going to climb this thing. Things can be better. I need you to see that. - You do it with me. - Fine. Fine. - Shit. - Hey. - Fang! - Shit. Come on, man. Come on. - Grab my hand. - I got you. Right leg, left left. Right there, you're good. You can do this. Come on. Come on. Right arm. Come on. It's not that much farther. Nice, dude. Come on. I got you. Come on. Yeah. Yeah, come on. You're almost there. We did it. We did it. Come on! Yeah! Woo! Woo! Hey, Faith. Yeah, baby! Stokum sucks! Yeah! Woo! They're publishing this list of names in the paper. - What? - They're publishing this list of names in the paper tomorrow. You know the men who got arrested up in McCreary Park? Well, Jack called me, and he said that it would be tomorrow. - Who the hell is Jack? Kite. Jack Kite, your dad's boss. - Why would my dad's boss call you, Fang? Why would he call you? - Because I know him. Because my name is on the list. - You know, I could stick around for a bit, hang out if you wanted. - No, no, dude. Get out of here. I'm cool. - That was really bad-ass, man. You are a friggin bad-ass. That was sick. - You think people are going to start calling me Todd at school now? Because that's, like, way gayer than Fang.. - Whatever, man. I'll take them out for you. - Have you seen your face? I love you, man. - I love you too. - I'll see you tomorrow, man. - Hey, look, I'm sorry about everything, about today, One Drum. I'm really sorry. I've been a real ass lately. - Yeah, you have. But you're not a loser. - Thanks. I guess I'll see you at school? - Yeah. - Allright. Bye. - Bye. Hey. - Yeah? Bye. - Bye. - What if cut just an inch or something? - Mom. - What? - You're so pretty. - Come on. - You really want to-- - Pretty? OK, now, it's definitely going off. - It's a big change. - I know. - OK. - Are you sure? - Yes. - That's your final answer? You've got a lot of courage. - Thanks, mom. - Still look pretty to me. There you are. What do you think? Aw. Yeah, we all die. But first, we get to live. And that's big. That's beautiful.
