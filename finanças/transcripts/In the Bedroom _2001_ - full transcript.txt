Where? It 's Saturday. There's some stuff I have to catch up on at the office. I won't be long. Do you want your receipt? Natalie? I hope I'm not disturbing you. Not at all. Could you break a 50, please? Excuse me. Thank you, dear. Could I possibly have another bag? Sure. Yeah, well, I was just... Just wondering how you're doing. I tried to reach you. We're at my mom's house now. -I wanted to call you. -No, that 's... It 's okay. Dr. Fowler, l... Yeah, I know. I didn't lie. I didn't lie the first time. It was... It 's how it came out. Mrs. Fowler? Can I get a pack of Marlboro Reds? How are the boys? They all right? I gotta go. I'll see you. So how much of this is yours? You ask me that every time. You know the cove on the other side of the cabin? All the way to the other shoreline. Almost 350 acres. Know what it went for when I bought it? You don't want to know. Oh, and that 's little Charles down at the pool. He figured out how to get down to the pool on the elevator... by himself. You must have been very proud. That 's Shannon waiting in line for, Oh, my God, that roller coaster. -You know that one? My God. -Were the lines very long? Sometimes. 60 minutes and upwards. Unless, of course, you got the... FastPass. What 's the FastPass? Well, you know, you got all these different kingdoms there. So you take this FastPass. It 's kind of a laminated card. You put into a machine, and it tells you when to come back so... so, you know, you don't have to wait in line. You just go right in and... You guys ever go to Florida? How many grandchildren do you have now? Well, all right, there's little Charles and Shannon... the three older ones, and the babies... That 's eleven. It must be wonderful. Willis always says, "I guess there's no danger of us dying off". I'm so sorry, Ruth. I just wasn't thinking. I wanted to have more. But we had Frank, and... Matt was just starting his practice. So I guess it made sense. Little Charles. 0nlyhalfacordofoak left at home... and you know how much that Daniels charges. At least I can stack this up to the cabin... have something to burn this fall. It 's awonderful product and they treat you pretty good. Because of selling Mary Kay we got the new Subaru. The ride up was very comfortable. It 's a nice car. It 's not really a car, it 's got 4-wheel drive. It 's a little SUV. -What the hell is all that SUV crap? -Sports Utility Vehicle. It 's a little jeep. SUV! And ATV, and KFC... -What 's with all these, these...? -Acronyms. I guess it 's just too much trouble to say what something is anymore. -What does PMS stand for? -All right, I was an army brat. I grew up with jeeps. Willy's uncomfortable... that I know more about one masculine thing than he does. Only one? -Thanks, buddy. -I like this guy. You've done a nice job up here, Katie. Don't tell me you made these curtains. -Is that antique linen? -Well, sort of. They're pillowcases from our first house. I've saved every knickknack and whim-wham we've ever had. You included. My timing is off. Of course, he don't like working in recruitment anymore. Them boys come to the office in the mall. They get half-processed, and they opt for that "delayed entry". -I couldn't do it. -Or they decide not to join up. Like that one kid there. He had him all the way through the works. Christ. The boy's folks called. Called David and said the boy was... He wanted out so bad that he... he'd taken his own life. Something like that gets to you. Christ, I couldn't do it. I'm going now. Are you looking forward to going back? You look nice. That was very good. I goofed up a little bit, but... Ruth? It comes in waves... and then nothing. Like a rest in music. No sound, but so loud. I don't know what to do. I feel so angry! Louise McVey... Iost a child a few years back. Maybe you remember. She had four. It was the youngest, wasn't it? She told me about avision she had... when she found out her daughter had died. She saw herself at a great distance from the Earth... and encircling it, an endless line. As she got closer... she saw that it was made up of mothers traveling forward. She felt into line and began walking with them. When they reached a certain point the line divided... and she said she knew... that all the millions of women on her side... were the mothers who had lost children. She seemed to find great comfort in that. How did the little girl die? A drowning, some kind of swimming accident. The name of the game is Texas Chase' Em. -Oh, jeez. -Is there a problem? Why delude yourself with that crap? -What? -We're not in Vegas. It 's 5-a-card draw or 7-card stud. That 's what I said. 5-a-card draw, jacks to open. -Carl? -Asshole. I'll bet a buck. Raise a buck. Say something, for chrissake. Quit pussyfooting around me. You want me to stare at these cards all night? "There are things of which I may not speak. There are dreams that cannot die. There are thoughts that made the strong heart weak... and bring a pallor into the cheek... and a mist before the eye... and the words of that fatal song... come over me like a chill: `A boy's will... is the wind's will... and the thoughts of youth... are long, long thoughts'." Okay, you got the two. -I'm in there. -I'll take one. Okay. I'm gonna need... I need them all. Three. -Make them good. -They're good, all right. You know where we're going? It 's asurprise. Matt? No. I'm sorry, that 's totally unacceptable. Yeah, so what did he say? No, we can't allow that. -Hold on. -Excuse me. Ryan Collit 's out there. -His mother just brought him in. -I'll call you later, okay? I'll be back at 4, Janelle. Sorry, Dr. Fowler, but you just missed him. Thank you. I really need to see him. He go to lunch? That 's right. He's across the street. Thank you. Matt. -Have aseat. -Thank you. -My assistant, Jack. -Hi, Jack. Don. This is Ed. Matt Fowler. So how's everything going? It 's okay, you know... I just wanted to go over a couple of things, and... -When you've had your lunch. -Sure. We're doing everything we can, Matt. I promise. -What can I do, Bill? -There's nothing, really. Look, it can't be manslaughter. There's got to be something. Can't you find something? Like some piece of evidence? Doesn't that happen? We're doing everything we can. But I'm not going to lie to you. All we've got is Strout, and he claims there was astruggle. Forensics can't determine that cause of the condition of the house. The best thing for you to do is just sit tight. Now, we haven't thrown in the towel yet, and you shouldn't either. We have two investigators working on this case. It 's still a priority case for us. We've got leads we're following up on... we've got a lot of things to do before we wrap this up... and we're doing the best we can with the resources that we have. You've gotta hang in there with us. You have to have some confidence. He nails these bats above this scale... because Bigmouth's gonna come in with his catch, you know? An old-timer says, "Ivan, what the hell are you doing?" The old man says, "Sending a message", and he walks out. I walk in, there's these damn baseball bats up on the wall, right? With a big note written right across the front of them! What 'd it say? "Here's the bats, if you got the balls." He never messed with our traps again. Hey, Dr. Fowler. Hi, Tim. Did he ever... Did he ever talk to you about what happened that day? I don't even see Richard anymore. And he'd never tell me anything anyway. Believe me. Sure, sure. Of course not. I was just wondering if... maybe you heard something through the grapevine. Maybe one of his buddies said something? I was thinking. His brothers still work with you, right? They must talk. What I'm saying is, if we could find something... just something concrete. I could be just aslip of the tongue. I'll keep my ears open. Thank you. It 's funny running into you. Here, Dr. Fowler. You know, well... I was hoping we could talk. I... I wanted to tell you how truly sorry I am... and... if there's anything that I can ever... do to... talk with you... I better get back to the grind. Don't steal anything. Hello, Mrs. Fowler. -Anything else? -A pack of Marlboro Lights. Sure. Now, that will be $ 14,95 with the cigarettes. Thank you. How did it go today? -Something wrong? -Wrong? What could be wrong, Matt? -What do you want? -I want to know what 's going on. Right. You're obviously upset. Is there something we can talk about? Talk? Who, us? What if somebody walked in? They wouldn't recognize us. They'd think they were in the wrong house. -Do you want to talk or not? -You mean about our dead son? We haven't before. Why should we bother now? What can I do, Ruth? Forget it, Matt. Why don't you just go? What do you want from me? I want you to stop acting like nothing's happened. That 's what I want. -Because I'm not hiting the walls? -That would require feelings. We don't want you to hurt yourself. Do me a favor. You want a grieving contest, go find someone else. I know how you grieve. Go have another beer. What the hell is that supposed to mean? What do you know? You know nothing. You don't know what I go through. No, I don't know what you go through or if you go through anything! But that 's your choice, dear, not mine. You're right. My choice is not to scream at the world. Maybe one of us has to be reasonable here. Reasonable? Gee, Matt... I don't know about you, but I miss my son. I'm glad you have time for reason. That 's what you imparted to Frank, that sense and reason. He thought you were very reasonable. What are you talking about? Nothing. Are you saying that l... that I'm the one responsible? Is that it? Well... Iet me tell you something. Let me tell you: you got it backwards! I know what you think, that I was too lenient! -That I let him get away with... -Everything! Everything! -And why didn't he come to you? -He wouldn't listen to me! -No, he wouldn't! -He didn't trust me. -Because you never listened to him. -No, but you did. You were winking at him the whole time. You encouraged him. You wanted what he had. Her. -My God, you've gotta be kidding! -You know it! You wanted it and you couldn't get it. That 's why you didn't stop him. So you could get your kicks through your son. You can't admit the truth to me or to yourself... that Frank died for your fantasy piece of ass! You want to know why our son is dead? You really want to know? He was with her not because of me. He went there because of you. Yes, he did. Because you are so controlling... so overbearing... so angry that he was it! That he was our only one. -That is not true! -Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Even when he was a kid, you were telling him how he was always wrong. I remember. One time you yanked him out of a Little League game... and sent him home... for throwing his glove in the dirt. He was what? 9 years old! Everything he did was wrong. Well, what was wrong with him, Ruth? You're... you're so unforgiving. You are. That 's what he said. And you're pulling the same shit with me. And that 's a horrible way to be. It 's horrible. You're bitter, Ruth. Point your finger at me all you like... but take a damn good look at yourself. I just wanted to talk about what happened, Matt. You want me to be open with you, embrace you? You scare me. How can I talk to you? Sometimes l... Sometimes I can't even look at you. God. That 's probably the police. Hi. I'm Kristen Gellar from the Rockland Gymnastics Association. We're selling brand-name candy. Each purchase is matched by the Tandy Corporation... to help us meet our goal of traveling to Oahu... to compete in the East/West conference. Okay, I'll take some. Oh, and today we have aspecial. Six bars for ten dollars. Okay, I'll do that. -Should I hold something? -Could you hold this? Thank you. -Okay, there's the ten. -Thank you. Here. You can pick anything you want. Any six? Ruth... what I said just now... I... I had no right. No one... No one should ever have to hear stuff like that. I'm so sorry. It 's okay. You're right, Matt. I am horrible. Please, please, please don't. I don't blame you. It 's just... That girl came by the school... and I couldn't forgive her. I was... I was so... I'm sorry. I've been so... I've been so angry. That 's okay. It 's just... I've seen him. I keep seeing him. I know. I... I know. In his room, you know, sometimes I can swear he's there. And today, at a stoplight... ...l could've sworn Frank... -Not Frank. Richard. And I don't know what to do. Ruth? Where did you see him? Everywhere, Downtown, at the market. I saw him... I saw him at South End. He smiled at me, Matt. I keep running into him. He smiled. It 's okay, it 's okay. -Honey, you coming to bed now? -Soon. Matt 's still here. Oh, well... Well, hi, Matt. Honey, when you come to bed, would you bring me my pills? They're on the top shelf from where the kids were here. -All right. -Thanks, dear. I never thought about bail. I thought I wouldn't have to worry about him for years. You know what I heard? He's tending bar up to Old Orchard Beach for a friend. You notice even the worst bastards have a friend? Nobody knows him there... If they do, they don't care. They drink what he mixes. I hate him, Matt. My boys went to school with him. He was the same. Know what he'll do? Five years at the most. Yeah, I know. Remember the woman about seven years ago? Shot her husband and dropped him off the bridge... with a 100-pound sack of cement... and said the whole way through it nobody helped her. -You know where she is now? -Where? She's up to Searsport now, asecretary. And whoever helped her, where the hell is he? It 'd break my heart, Matt. It would. But, you ever think about just... moving away? Yeah, we have. It wouldn't matter. I'll lock up. I'll walk you to your car. -Good night. See you tomorrow. -Wait up! -Want to come over for a drink? -No, thanks. -Come on! -Maybe some other night. Just one drink! Come on! All right. Fucking bitch! What are you doing here? Anything I can help you with? -Don't talk. -God. Unlock the door and get in. Wait just a minute. Let 's calm down. All right, all right. All right. All right, all right. Unlock it. Is there anyone in your place? -Not tonight. -Good. Drive there. Drive slowly. -Don't try to get stopped. -All right. He was making it with my wife, Dr. Fowler. Don't talk. Let 's go to the back door. Keep your mouth shut. Turn the light on. -Where's your suitcase? -My suitcase? -Yeah, where is it? -In the bedroom closet. Okay, that 's where we're going. When you come to a door, stop and turn the light on. Let 's go. There's no wall switch. -Where's the light? -By the bed. Go ahead. Sit down. On the bed. Which closet is it? Where are the suitcases? I wanted to work things out with Natalie. I tried to get back together again. But I couldn't. I couldn't talk to her. He was always with her. It was an accident. I'm going to jail. If I get out, I'll be an old man. Isn't that enough? You're not going to jail. Pack clothes form warm weather. You're going to let me go? You're going to jump bail. What? Go ahead. -Go ahead! -All right, all right. See, it 's the trial. We can't go through that, my wife and I. That 's why you're leaving. I've got you a ticket. My wife keeps seeing you. I can't have that anymore. Thank you, Dr. Fowler. I'd go pick up my boys and he'd be there. Sometimes he spent the night. Duncan told me. -I'm sorry, Dr. Fowler. -All right, that 's enough. I need some things from the bathroom. -Keep walking. -I gotta pee. Go ahead. Wait. Let 's go. They'll catch me. They're going to check passenger lists. I didn't use your name. They'll figure that out. I would've done it myself if it was that easy. You were alone. We got it worked out. Who's "we"? Start the engine. Let 's go. There's no planes this time of night, Dr. Fowler. Go north on 73. The airport 's south. Someone's gonna keep you awhile. They'll take you to the airport. Turn the radio on. Find the game. -It 's after 1:00. -They run it again. No more talking. Let's see, the last Red Sox player to have a 3-home run game... would've been Trot Nixon last year in Detroit. Norman had one previous to that... off with a fast ball, ball one. He holds to get back at first, the out fields wung around to their left. And a ground ball roll at a stretch stop. Flip to second before it starts back, it's four on the fourth. Actually hits to a fourth play to end the Inning. 6/4 to get Doug back. The second the Inning is over, Red Sox have left 7 after 6. The Red Sox 7, the Braves 2... on the WEPI Red Sox Radio Network. 6 for 10 on the home run he had hit too. Hits one into the air... -Turn around. -Why? We missed it, turn around! There's nothing back here, Dr. Fowler. I don't understand why we don't just drive to the airport. You don't think we'd leave your car at the airport, do you? I'll do 20 years, Dr. Fowler. I'll be 53 years old. That 's ayear younger than I am now. Where are we? Almost there. Turn it off. Leave the lights on. -Is this your cabin, Dr. Fowler? -No, it isn't. Let 's get the bags. -Mr. Grinnel. -I'll get them, son. Wait. You can take this. Matt! What did you do? This isn' t what we talked about. He... He tried to run. We were going to wait and take him out in the woods. I couldn't wait. I better get the ATV. Wait. Come on, we gotta go. Come on, go! What time is it? It 's 10 to 4. We lost an hour, I'm sorry. Yeah. High tide. Can't stop people from fishing, Matt. -Fucking bridge. -I'm sorry, Willis. Stopped into his little shed there once. Place reeked. He's spilled more whiskey than we've ever drunk. We'll just pray he's already three sheets to the wind. Katie's pill will be wearing off soon. Did you do it? Are you all right, Matt? There was a picture of him and Natalie on the wall. What is it, Matt? The way she was smiling. What? I don't know. Matt... What am I thinking? You must be hungry. Matt! Matt? Do you want coffee? CAPTIONS BY ABEZ
