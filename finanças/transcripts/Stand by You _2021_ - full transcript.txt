Happy Pride, everybody!

Can y'all say howdy? Howdy! One more time for Miss Pearl. Howdy! Howdy! Thank you so much for filling the Ryman up with all this love and support in honor of Pride Month! We're happy to have everybody here under one roof. Everybody's welcome here! Now, before we get started and dive even deeper into this fabulous gig that I've put together all by myself with no help, I wanna just say after this last year and a half, I think we could all use some good ol' entertaining escapism. And I'm just happy and honored that I can be the one to serve an hour of flamboyant fantasy, honey! But the LGBTQ+ community that we are here to celebrate and honor is constantly experiencing the struggles that some of us have only had to face due to COVID-19, such as isolation, being distanced or removed from our families, or feeling a loss of freedom in lockdown. Hate and injustice and inequality, it's a global pandemic all on its own. This community and the rights of individuals a part of it are at risk. Lockdown does not have to be physical. What about when you aren't able to move freely as your fully expressive self because of violence or judgement? Not cute. My goal through Happy Hippie, my nonprofit that supports LGBTQ+ youth, is to erase the hate and replace it with freedom. Standing here in a state that stands proud on patriotism, and in the US that represents "The Land of the Free," there is an extensive amount of devoted action that must take place for this country to be exactly all of that for all Americans. And so for my first musical guests, I'm very proud to introduce multi-Grammy award winners and allies to this community, Little Big Town. And it's a big deal! Come on now. Come on, silver. Come on, shoe. You with the sad eyes Don't be discouraged Oh, I realize it's Hard to take courage In a world full of people You can lose sight of it all And the darkness makes you feel so small But I see your true colors shining through I see your true colors, and that's why I love you So don't be afraid To let them show Your true colors True colors Are beautiful like a rainbow Yes, they are. Show me a smile Then don't be unhappy Can't remember when I Last saw you laughing If this world makes you crazy And you've taken all you can bear You call me up Because you know I'll be there And I see your true colors shining through - Yes! - I see your true colors And that's why I love you So don't be afraid - Come on! - To let them show Your true colors True colors Are beautiful Like a rainbow Come on. I can't remember when I last saw you laugh. If this world makes you crazy and you've taken all you can bear Just call me up 'Cause you know I'll be there I'll see your true colors, shining through - Yes! - I see your true colors And that's why I love you So don't be afraid To let them show Your true colors True colors Are beautiful Like a rainbow Yes, they are! Thank you! Is this not the most fun show? It's all down here from here. Thank you. Thanks so much, LBT! NBD. We're cool like that. Thank you, everybody. As you know, we're here to celebrate something very special. Tonight will be all about my outfits! I mean... having a good time surrounded by love and great music, but most importantly bringing awareness to really important issues. Now, with that being said, this next song is off a record of mine called "Can't Be Tamed"... which was about my own personal self expression and freedom. This song is one that I wrote for a friend of mine struggling to come out in 2010, and the conversation wasn't nearly as fluid and open as it is today. But there is still so much progress to be made. This song is called, "My Heart Beats For Love." I've been stranded on a lonely street Got lost in the shadows, fell hard in the battle Heard cries and the suffering Walked through the darkness, left broken and heartless I'm calling out, can you hear my voice? I'm gonna find you through all the noise You know there's nothing that I wouldn't do To shine your light as I reach for you My heart beats for love, My heart beats for love It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up It breathes in my chest, and it runs through my blood My heart beats for love, my heart beats for love Oh, yeah And I've been told at least a thousand times It's not worth the struggle, the hurt or the trouble I keep running up to these front lines No, no, I won't surrender I'll wait here with you forever I'm standing here with my flag held high Can't you see that it's worth the fight - Sing along! - My heart beats for love My heart beats for love It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up It breathes in my chest, it runs through my blood My heart beats for love, my heart beats for love Sing it with me if you know it. I'll run across this battlefield Screaming out, can you hear me now? I'm holding on, I stand my ground I'm screaming out, can you hear me - Now? - My heart beats for love My heart beats for love It's the sound that I hear Tells me we won't give up It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood My heart beats for love, my heart beats for love My heart beats for love, my heart beats for love It's the sound that I hear I promise, I won't give up! It breathes in my chest, and it runs through my blood My heart beats for love, My heart beats for love I'm gonna keep fighting for us, for our community that we treasure and we hold so dear. And while I do it, I'mma be in Gucci. Alright! Now I want to introduce my very special next guest. We're starting out with TJ, who loves a man with a sense of humor and online gaming. And John who loves pad Thai and his favorite color is a calming shade of blue. And together, they are my new friends, Brothers Osborne. Slay 'em, TJ. Many times, I tried to tell you Many times, I cried alone Always, I'm surprised how well You cut my feelings to the bone Don't want to leave you, really I've invested too much time To give you up that easy To the doubts that complicate your mind We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better We belong We belong, we belong together Maybe it's a sign of weakness When I don't know what to say And maybe I just wouldn't know What to do with my strength anyway Have we become a habit? Do we distort the facts? Now there's no looking forward Now there's no turning back When you say we belong to the light We belong to the thunder You're everything! We belong to the sound of the words We've both fallen under Oh, whatever we deny or embrace For worse or for better We belong We belong, we belong together Close your eyes and try to sleep now Close your eyes and try to dream Clear your mind and do your best To try and wash the palette clean We can't begin to know it How much we really care I hear your voice inside me I see your face everywhere - Still you say - We belong to the light We belong to the thunder We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under Oh, whatever we deny or embrace For worse or for better We belong We belong, we belong together We belong, we belong! We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder We belong We belong to the sound of the words We've both fallen under Yeah! Whatever we deny or embrace For worse or for better We belong We belong, we belong together We belong Thank you! I gotta say, we do belong, all of us. We belong! Thank you, Brothers Osborne.

It might not feel like it all the time, but we have made a lot of progress in recent years. This is a celebration, so I want to start with something. In the U.S., marriage equality became the law of the land in 2015. And a record number of out athletes competed in the last Olympics. And a record number of LGBTQ lawmakers were elected in 2018. And we now have the first openly gay cabinet member. What about that? We are seeing our community represented more and more in all of its beautiful diversity in culture, politics, and leadership. It's important to recognize all the wins, no matter how big or small. And talk about a big win, I wanna bring out Grammy winner and dancing queen, Maren Morris, to celebrate! She's everything.

You're riding high on love's true bluish light Hey! Mickey! Girl... My girl slays. And she parties, so we gotta go! Hey! These are the kind- When I ask you if you like my outfit, this is the reaction I'm looking for. Okay? Take note. Jaime's been saying "sickening" all day, but this is the kind of enthusiasm, when I'm like, "Ain't this cute?" It's like, yeah! It's sickening! It's everything! Like, this is what I'm asking for. "Yeah, looks good. Can we talk about the show?" That's what I get. Alright. Nashville is the home of country music. And country music is all about authentic storytelling. And the more people we welcome in and allow them to be who they are, the more personal stories we will get to hear. And being born and raised in Nashville, I know treating others how we wanna be treated, hospitality, and kind-heartedness is at the core of our values. That's the spirit of the South. It's what we're known for. So, I encourage and ask my city to be welcoming to all people because that's who we are, and that's what we do. Tennessee has been a place that I call home all of my life, and it provides me with a sense of safety that I wish for everyone to experience. So, let's be that place, Nashville, where people of all identities feel at home. There is a lot of work to be done and progress to be made. But this next song is about not being discouraged by the distance, but inspired by the journey. Life's a climb. But the view is great! I can almost see it That dream I'm dreaming But there's a voice inside my head Saying you'll never reach it Every step I'm taking Every move I make feels Lost with no direction My faith is shaking I I gotta keep trying Got to keep my head held high There's always gonna be another mountain Always gonna wanna make it move Always gonna be an uphill battle Sometimes, I'm gonna have to lose Ain't about how fast I get there Ain't about what's waiting on the other side It's the climb The struggles I'm facing The chances I'm taking Sometimes might knock me down But no, I'm not breaking And I may not know it But these are the moments That I'm gonna remember most, yeah I just gotta keep going, and I I gotta be strong Let me hear you! Just keep pushing on 'Cause There's always gonna be another mountain I'm always gonna wanna make it move Always gonna be an uphill battle Sometimes, I'm gonna have to lose Ain't about how fast I get there It ain't about what's waiting on the other side It's the climb Oh, yeah There's always gonna be another mountain Always gonna wanna make it move Always gonna be an uphill battle It ain't about how fast I get there It ain't about what's waiting on the other side It's the climb Oh, yeah Let me hear you! Well, keep on moving, keep climbing Keep the faith, baby Let me hear you! It's all about, it's all about The climb Keep the faith Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Okay. Hold on. We got lipstick time. We gotta do it here. Just give me a powder, honestly. You guys want to see me beat my face? Honestly. We're just gonna do it here. This is a safe space. We can all do what we need to do. This is James, who beat my mug. I'm gonna do a tutorial. So first we go in with our beauty blender. Okay. Actually, don't take any makeup advice from me. This has been a shit show. But... I'm just joking. He's sickening, and he's iconic. A little red lipstick on the tip never hurt anybody. Thank you. Alright. Now, to create the changes we want to see, it's gonna take dedication. To make progress, you have to be disciplined and take small steps towards big dreams and be devoted daily. I learned everything I know about that type of diligence from my coaches at Premier Cheerleading here in Nashville. And it's with pride, I introduce the next generation of cheerleaders of Premier Athletics! I wanna thank my coaches, Chasity & Jay, for making this possible and instilling in me that nothing worth anything is easy. It takes persistence and determination.

I couldn't have asked for more incredible people to fill up this room. Including you guys, and you beautiful gals, everybody backstage that made it possible, NBC and Peacock, everybody that put this show on. It has been a dream come true to celebrate pride and share this message with y'all. So, we're gonna close this show with a song that is about not what we want but what we demand. This song is called "Freedom". I won't let you down I will not give you up I gotta have faith in the sound It's the one good thing that I've got I won't let you down So please don't give me up 'Cause I would really, really love to stick around Oh, yeah Yeah, heaven knows I was just a young boy Didn't know what I wanted to be Didn't know what I wanted to be I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy I guess it was enough for me Guess it was enough for me To win the race, a prettier face Brand new clothes and a big fat place On your rock and roll TV Rock and roll TV But today the way I play the game is not the same No way I think I'm gonna make myself happy Now I'm gonna get me some happy I think there's something you should know I think it's time I told you so There's something deep inside of me There's someone else I've got to be Take back your picture in a frame Take back your singing in the rain I just hope you understand Sometimes the clothes don't make the man All we have to do now Is take these lies - And make them true - Somehow All we have to see Is that I don't belong to you And you don't belong to me, - Yeah, yeah - Freedom Freedom Freedom You've got to give for what you take Freedom Oh, yeah! Freedom Oh, yeah, freedom Hey! You've got to give for what you take Heaven knows we sure had some fun, boy What a kick, just a buddy and me I see you! We had every big-shot good-time band on the run, boy We were living in a fantasy - Hey! - Living in a fantasy Yeah, we won the race, got out of the place And I went back home, got a brand new face - For the boys on MTV - Boys on MTV But today the way I play the game has got to change - Oh, yeah - Oh, yeah Now I'm gonna get myself happy Now I'm gonna get me some happy I think there's something you should know I think it's time I stop the show There's something deep inside of me There's someone I forgot to be Take back your pictures in a frame Don't think that I'll be back again I just hope you understand Sometimes the clothes don't make the man - But sometimes they do, honey! - All we have to do now Is take these lies And make them true somehow All we have to see Is that I don't belong to you And you don't belong to me Yeah, yeah! Yeah, oh, yeah Freedom Oh, freedom You've got to give for what you take Freedom Oh, yeah, freedom Oh, yeah, freedom You've got to give for what you take Freedom is a basic human right. Well, right now for some of us, it's more of a privilege than a luxury. My dad always says that a problem clearly defined is half solved. But we know the issues we're faced with. But now we have to look them fearlessly in the eye. and confront generations of misunderstanding and hatred. We can't end at awareness. We can't talk about it. We got to be about it. We gotta combat these issues with education, compassion, brazenness, and above all else, love! Love is always the answer. Whenever you're in doubt about yourself, your own power, your identity, your sexuality, whatever the challenge you're facing may be, love is never wrong. As Mama Ru says, "If you can't love yourself, "how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else? "Can I get an amen!" All we have to do now Is take these lies - And make them true - Somehow All we have to see Is that I don't belong to you And you don't belong to me, yeah, yeah Freedom Oh, yeah, freedom Oh, yeah, freedom You've got to give for what you take Freedom Oh, yeah, freedom Oh, yeah, freedom You've got to give for what you take We're sending little sparkles and peace, hope, and optimism to everybody at home who joined us to celebrate Pride here at the Ryman!
