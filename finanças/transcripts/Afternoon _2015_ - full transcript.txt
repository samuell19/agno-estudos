How can we imagine the filming crew isn't here? I will start the conversation, of course. Kang, I see that your toes are yellow. That's right. Because I soaked them in sulfur. The kind used to treat athlete's foot. It's all because of you. All because of your play, The Monk From Tang Dynasty. I had to walk barefoot every day. I walked until my feet became blistered. The sulfur stops my feet from rotting. They used to apply makeup on my feet to make it look like I've trudged through hard terrain. Now it's not necessary anymore. It's still necessary. Aren't they rotten enough? Let me see your soles. Are they itchy? Of course, and there are blisters as well. Even on the sides? Those are blisters from rubbing against my shoes. As I was sitting here earlier, before you joined me... I felt like I wanted to have a conversation with you. I felt a little... You probably don't know what I'm thinking of. I think I do. You mentioned earlier that you wanted to... talk about your last wishes. Recently, I've been getting this strong feeling that I may be dying soon. It took me a while... to calm myself down. It's as if... I'm getting myself ready. Perhaps it's because of the book. I began to write down my thoughts. I thought of my grandpa this morning as I swept the floor. When my grandpa was suffering from dementia. It wasn't what he had forgotten that impacted me the most. It wasn't that he had forgotten who I was or the many strange things he did like mixing salt into the rice jar or pouring coffee powder into the salt, making everyone mad. One time he passed motion on the floor. My grandma and I had to clean up the mess. And then he disappeared. It was none of those things. The thing that impacted me the most was when he... When he swept the floor. He would sweep the road when he got up in the morning. Outside our old flat... The corridor? Not the corridor. From our door to that brick wall, remember? The one in the ending frame of Walking on Water. He swept all the way there. I have the habit of sweeping the floor too. So I suddenly recalled his image. He did this every day. We felt safer when he went sweeping the road because he'd always come back. He never swept the inside of our flat. I don't recall ever seeing him sweep inside. It was probably my grandma who did it inside. That's what he did during his last days, just sweeping. I have the habit of sweeping the floor every morning no matter how clean the floor is. I've always wondered what this action meant to me. It's like sweeping up the dust. I don't like visiting the home of someone who doesn't sweep. Our world is always dirty, so we have to sweep constantly. Now we're doing the play, The Monk From Tang Dynasty. We have been making films together for so long and we have filmed all kinds of subjects. Masturbation... homosexuals... You hiding under a bed while a couple made love... and even the porn film industry. When we came to the subject of Xuanzang, I felt... and especially because it is with you... Xuanzang is a... I think when you're close to death... I don't know what's happening to me. I want to sort out this feeling... I'm sorry, it feels like I'm acting in front of the camera. I've become used to facing the camera now. I didn't use to. I'm glad because... It's like a training for me... I often pointed the camera at you but I didn't like facing it myself. But now I'm used to it. I've been thinking a lot. Recently, I've had this strong feeling... Before we made Stray Dogs, I fell seriously ill. I felt better when we began filming. Perhaps because I was so concentrated on working. But I still suffered frequent backaches. Pengfei often helped to massage my back. By the time we began editing, I felt like I was dying. I had been taking blood pressure medication for half a year and there have been serious side effects. I felt like I would stop breathing or pass out anytime. Then I went to see a Chinese physician and got better. So I stopped taking the western medicine. Later, when we found this house, I told you that I would die happy if I could live here for just one day. I don't know. All my life... I never felt like I needed to own a house. I have always rented. It's ironic. I often tell people that I don't feel a sense of belonging. But I've always had you by my side. It's been more than twenty years, since 1991. And we will continue to live together. We bought this land and this house together. As we were fixing up the house, I began to feel unwell again. That's why I was so anxious to buy this house and have it fixed up as soon as possible. I felt that I may not live long enough to see it. The first night after we moved in, I couldn't sleep at all. Partly because of the unfamiliar environment. But also because I felt this is my house, my home now. I didn't feel like going anywhere else. I began to turn down invitations that required me to travel far. It's interesting. It's as if I have found something special. A wonderful gift from heaven near the end of my life, this beautiful valley that I can look at every day. Something to savor and enjoy every day. I feel that it is a sense of belonging. And... you haven't said anything yet. But let me continue... Recently, I began to feel while we were working on The Monk From Tang Dynasty that my body can't seem to take it. It isn't fatigue, but I'm not sure what the problem is. I often feel out of breath. My head and my scalp would feel numb just like the way I felt when I first got ill. I began to wonder if I would, all of a sudden lose my mental functions and become demented or even pass away suddenly. I felt that it could come any time. We've lost many people recently like Li Lung-yu and Wang Jingwen and my friend in Singapore... and also Ya Jun. Life could end suddenly like that without any warning. But I feel that I can sense it coming. I believe when I leave one day I will know exactly when, like those Buddhist monks. But I wish it wouldn't be so soon so that I can enjoy this life a little longer. A life where I'm not doing anything. So today... as I was sitting here on my own waiting for them to prepare the camera I was wondering what our conversation would be about. I haven't given much thought to it except that it would be a conversation. I felt like I wanted to tell you something. That I may leave at any moment. So... If I were to fall ill suddenly, I may not be able to tell you this anymore. We have been with each other for more than twenty years. We've faced so much... how should I put it? It hasn't exactly been tumultuous. The worst we've faced have turned out to be insignificant. We have survived them all. But I do have many wonderful memories. Somehow they're all related to death. Like when my grandma passed away, we were at... We'd just gotten off a plane in Los Angeles. We were there for a film festival. Was it a festival? There were Taiwanese students helping out. I think so. Probably UCLA students. Yes, it was their film festival. Do you remember which film we showed? Was it Vive L'Amour or The River? Anyway, we got a call as soon as we landed and I left immediately, leaving you in L.A. That night, I received news of her death. She was my closest kin, other than my grandfather. We had to bury her within two or three days because of the humidity in the tropics. So I left the very next morning. That night, I told you that I've always had you by my side. You gave me a shoulder to cry on. And when my father passed away... That was actually earlier. Wasn't it? He left in 1992? Yes, he left earlier. It was during Rebels of the Neon God. You were at my place that day. My sisters were there too. We lived in Jingmei then. You were there to comfort me through times like these. And then there was Miao Tien. I remember it clearly. We were at the hotel in Berlin. We already knew that we'll be getting an award. But we didn't know which one. That morning, I felt very sad for some reason. I woke up at six in the morning in the hotel room. Then I went to Shiang-chyi's room. She was in the room across from me. She let me in and we laid down together. I asked her to keep me company because I was feeling sad. Later, at around seven o'clock. Lu Yi-ching came over and told us that Miao Tien has left us. Then I went to look for you. I remember my first words were. I don't want you to leave before I do. I won't be able to take it. Does this conversation have to be this miserable? I just feel like expressing my gratitude towards you. For being by my side all this time. I also remember... and you can tell it yourself later or even scold me. I remember that we actually quarreled a lot. The worst time was when our company fell victim to a fraud scheme and lost our money. We had just finished Goodbye Dragon Inn and The Missing. You haven't made Help Me Eros, right? We were doing publicity and preparing for The Wayward Cloud. Before we started filming, our grant money got swindled away. It was a inside job. He was someone I trusted the most. I handed him the company bank account and company seal. We expected him to take care of our money. But he betrayed us. It was a huge blow to me. I lost faith in people. I trusted him too much. And then I remember you called me one night. Did I call you? Or did you call me? You were at home and I was at the office. You told me that you didn't want to be with me anymore. We lost everything, including your mom's apartment which we had mortgaged for the company. That man studied economics, so he's really shrewd. I was really sad at that time. You told me that you had nothing left. When I heard that, I yelled over the phone. I said that we are not left with nothing. We have made many great films together. You remember that? Luckily you didn't leave me, and we carried on together. So sometimes when I give a speech. I encounter people who don't understand how we work together. They only see us in that moment. They know that we have a new film in theatres and has won some awards. Many of them are curious, but nobody really understands us. Of course we have a group of supporters. But everyone must be wondering... why a director and actor who are not popular would continue making this films that are hard to understand. I often reply by saying that in spite of all this, I still feel very fortunate. And it's all because I am with you. My deepest impression was when we were editing The Missing. We were on the motorcycle together. I was taking you home from the film lab. We came to the Fu He Bridge and saw a police checkpoint. I switched places with you because I had no license. As we were passing the police I felt the summer breeze as we crossed the bridge. The police didn't stop. I told you then that I felt very fortunate. It was a very strong feeling of bliss. Because we were making films together again. And we have been working together for so long. I had moved to Yong He at that time too. I told other people that my life was blissful. I don't know if they really understood what I meant. Another time I felt that way was in Portugal. A small film festival by the beach. Portugal? A short film festival. We stayed at the... Tony Rayns was the juror that year. We stayed at an inn on a hill with a bridge. A coastal bridge. It was evening time and we had a film screening at night. We walked down the bridge to the beach. I still remember the image in my mind. That golden sunset. There were fishes jumping about under the bridge. We were very happy and kept taking photos. I said that I felt very blissful. That same feeling came back again. What I'm trying to say is. In the worst of times and the best we have been together. Our relationship is hard to understand or define. All the rumors and gossip out there don't really seem to affect us. I think we have been blessed with a wonderful gift. These wonderful years we've had. What I want to say is simple. I just wanted to take the opportunity, because Stray Dogs is going to the art museum, to have a conversation with you and have it shown at the art museum. Of course, this is not our first foray into the art museum. We made Face at the Louvre Museum. Sometimes I can't understand... what is it that brought us together. After I met you... and even now, I often wonder what if we had never met? Whether it is my cinema or your life. How different would they be? We seldom talk like this. Most days we say very little to each other. Even now, I feel like I'm talking to myself. Unless we were arguing. But even then, you'd only shout a few angry words. That's the way we are. So I'm curious to know. What would you say to me today, given this opportunity. For me, it's simple. I just want to thank you. I think you have changed my life. Aren't we supposed to talk about Stray Dogs? What about Stray Dogs? No, we're not talking about Stray Dogs. Let's not talk about the film. Talk about us, anything you want. I could say more if there were less people around. We have so much between us that I can't even begin to talk about in this lifetime. My personal life, your personal life. I don't know how far we can take this, we'll see. Sometimes I feel like asking you if you hate me. Of course not, why would I? I am a person with little desires. In terms of my career... I have never promoted myself or recommended myself for any movie roles. I am not a competitive person. I lead a carefree life, so with you, I suppose I'm the only person in the world who can put up with your temper. That's right, which is why I'm miserable. I believe I am a highly adaptive creature. Do you know why... Is it me who puts up with you or the other way around? Of course it's me who puts up with you. I do too! So why do you think we can stand each other? How do you put up with me? Because... Your temper poses no threat to me. It gives me stress, but not a threat. What do you mean? It sounds horrible. It's stressful because you want to control this and that. Everyone has a bit of a control freak in them. My mom is naggy enough already and you are like a second mom who nags at me all day. But at least I'm not possessive, am I? No, not really. That's right, I'm not. I'd much rather you go work with someone else. I don't know why, but you're like a child to me. Can I smoke? Sure, go ahead. You are more like my child which is why... I am always looking out for you. For example... I will always think of ways to make your situation better. Let's say you want to work with someone else. I will first think about your working relationship. I'm not worried that it would change you. I'm always thinking in that direction. But I have no say when someone else is directing. So I can only nag at you. Making sure that you take note of this and that. I won't try and interfere with how someone else directs. I would like to push you to work with others. Mainly because I hope you can earn more money. Maybe you'll be happier that way. Because you won't earn a lot with me. I'm not doing it for the money. I just want to see more of the outside world. Because in Tsai Ming-Liang's world, I'm like the ruins. An insignificant character. Did the ruins turn into a luxury mansion? It never did. I've never driven a Ferrari or led the life of a rich man. So I want to go out and see what possibilities there are. But you did go out. For example, you went deep sea fishing. You are like my child. Whatever you do, I always think about your safety first. Always safety first. I get worried when you go to the beach. I was always feeling anxious during that time. I also worry about you mixing with bad company. It really shouldn't be my concern. But you know I will be worried. I'll worry when you are still at the beach late at night. I worry that you'll go scuba-diving in illegal waters. I worry about these and other horrible things. Like when there's a typhoon, I repeatedly told you not to go but you went anyway. Sometimes I wonder if I am abnormal. No, that's perfectly normal. It's me... who wants to go and experience the danger. To do more outdoor activities, which I enjoy. So I let you be. I will only nag at you I also keep some weird creatures. Don't you ever hate me? No. Why should I hate you? I told you I have little desires. Don't you feel that I have intruded into your life and turned it into a different kind of life? Tell me honestly. Do you know what I mean? Making my films and... Actually we are both quite thrifty. You are thriftier than me. We don't go out to play. We don't enjoy playing much. We don't enjoy socializing or taking risks. We lead an ordinary almost bland life. I don't know. I feel that way. A bland life? What about the things you do in secret? I know about them but I can't tell. You can tell if you want. Of course I have my pleasures. There are times when I need to release myself. We all do. We're all human. But it's hard for us... to enjoy those places... I don't enjoy those places actually. Did you ever worry about me? Worry? You mentioned earlier... that you put up with me. What else about me do you put up with? It's really not that bad. You just like to make comments. You have a bad temper. It's hard for anyone to tell you anything. You have strong opinions on things. Everyone else is always wrong. People don't like to talk to you much. That's true. Many people will communicate to you through me. Because I know how to talk to you. It's tiring to be the bridge sometimes. Recently, someone asked me to be in a movie. I waited more than a month before telling you. I read the screenplay. But I felt it wasn't up to standard. I told them that if it didn't pass my standard it definitely will not pass Tsai's. So I told him to revise it. Only when it was more acceptable did I tell you about it. I was pleasantly surprised when you agreed immediately. I am always willing to agree! But I will consider the big picture. Will it benefit you in any way? The quality and working conditions should be acceptable. It's not about how much they will pay you. It's usually about the production conditions. For example, if someone asks you to play a school principal. Do you think it will work? You did it anyway and I thought it was really weird. I was often worried about you that way. But later, when you got less offers, I was less worried. You haven't been getting offers in the past few years so I am less worried. I am more concerned about your health. For example, the problem with your neck. How will you handle other people's expectations of you? I was shocked when I visited you on Ann Hui's film set. Your neck wasn't too serious at that time. Because you had just undergone treatment for it. So when she requested you to cry and put on an act for the camera, I was shocked. Because I didn't think you were that kind of actor. That's why you were very tired at that time. The results were not exactly ideal either. I am basically like your agent, protecting you but not interfering in your work. Especially when you work with good directors. I trust them with their methods. But I feel you are a different kind of actor unlike Anthony Wong, who can be very versatile. You are different. And because of that, I think you are very precious. I was particularly anxious when later on... after The River and The Hole around the time that your father passed away you signed a contract with a talent agency. That was the period when I was most anxious. Because you had signed on with a Hong Kong agency. How should I put it... I wasn't sure if you could hold on to your unique quality. Of course I can. It comes from my heart. And you often argued with me at that time. You said you didn't want to play a gay man all the time. I was aware of your resistance to such roles. You were under an agency and other directors wanted you. But I never stopped you. I just didn't want you to feel that way. I didn't want you to resist being in my films. That resistance went away eventually. I am now in discussions with a talent agency in China. Well, it's not really an agency. It's a person from China I'm in discussion with. I made you a priority in my conditions. He asked me what happens if a China and Taiwan production clashed. I told him my priority is your films, followed by the China ones and finally other Taiwanese projects. I am no longer worried about these issues. I feel that you have reached a new level after Stray Dogs. You can take on any role offered to you. In recent years, ever since our stage play, Only You. I've had this strong feeling. Seeing you perform to a large audience with such ease. I felt I had nothing to worry about. Except your neck problem. I don't think my neck poses a problem in other people's films. Why is it my problem again? Because you shoot such long takes. Their takes are over in two or three seconds. I won't have any problem with my neck. Besides, you often require actors to blank out in a scene which is actually quite difficult, especially for me. Because when an actor's mind is in a blank state he will feel uneasy and uncertain of what to do so it may end up looking unnatural. Like when I have my photo taken, I often look unnatural. I look more unnatural in a photo than when I am acting. But this is how you've been acting for the past twenty years. Same goes for Lu Yi-ching, Chen Shiang-chyi and Kuei-mei. This is how I see it. I don't need you to follow my direction. No need to express anything, but simply deal with the situation. I think that's more real for me. It's better than reading lines or exploring the motivation. I can no longer work that way. Do you know what I mean? I never ask how you feel because I don't want to know. There is no need to know. Of course, as you said, it's sometimes more difficult. Now I feel, ever since we finished Stray Dogs. I have complete faith that you can achieve anything. For example, this new play that we are working on. Did I ever discuss anything with you? No. I'd tell you to walk slower or faster, that's all. More relaxed, more like a dance. That's how I instruct you. Every time you performed, like in The Monk From Tang Dynasty I am very happy. Everything you do on the stage becomes a scene. Even eating a Chinese pastry for fifteen minutes. I think it's difficult for someone else to achieve that. My editor Xiaolei told me that every time she edits your scene she feels that no one could ever replace you. So you must be confident. You are an actor like that. You are a walking actor, not a... How should I put it? What I'm trying to say is, you are full of confidence now. So go out there and do it. As for me, I wonder if I have any more roles for you. I don't know what's coming next. But I know that whatever it is, it will involve you. Without you, I won't make a film. The question is, why is that? Why am I so insistent on doing it this way? I seldom tell you this. I sometimes talk about it with my audience during talks or with my students when I'm teaching a class. I often make you a subject of my discussion. I often tell them not to study me, but to study you instead. If you want to learn about me, go study Lee Kang Sheng. I'd sometimes invite you to the classroom to answer questions from the students or simply let them observe you while I step aside. I know you won't say much, but I think that's OK. I often wonder about this. I am very glad that God gave you to me. He really did give you to me. You became an important element in my creative work. Without you, I won't be where I am today. When I see the work we've completed together. I realize how international they are. We're going to art festivals in Vienna or Brussels, etc. Or the short film, Walker, which can be seen in Brussels soon exhibited in a gallery in an underground bunker. Viewed by visitors daily. I can't explain it, but I feel really proud. This is how we work. It is our collaboration. That's why I feel that you're God's greatest gift to me. It's like I've been blessed with a child. A good child... Or rather, one who is willing to go along with my ideas. And have resulted in works that are quite unique. I think you can trace the development of all our creative works. Everything seems to have been destined. For example, our first film was Rebels of the Neon God. And the first role you played in The Kid was a rebellious child. Someone who blackmails another child, but is not really bad I've always wanted to be a bad child, but I could never do it. I was a rebellious child. Not in terms of my behavior, but in terms of my mentality. Mentally. That's right. Even though I grew up in a strict family with a stern father. I still dared to try and find fault with him. I followed him one day to see if he was having an affair. I was punished for that, but I had no regrets. I had to kneel and apologize. You know what I mean? I had a strange personality as a kid. But when I met you, I felt that you were my alter ego. I can express that side of myself through you. You retook your college entrance exams several times. I accompanied you to register one time. I felt that you didn't fit into the current mainstream life. But you couldn't do anything about it. Yet you're not a bad child. You know what I mean? I guess I saw that factor in you. That's why I began working with you. From Rebels of the Neon God to The Monk From Tang Dynasty I think your transformation has been very interesting. Xuanzang didn't become a Buddha. He simply went inside himself. It is a journey into his inner world. I think you are the same. I feel that I can only enter my inner world through you. Because you are very calm while I am always restless. So back to the question of how you put up with me... It's been twenty two years. I have put up with you for twenty two years too. I have to put up with your apparent indifference. You seem to exist and not exist at the same time. But of course you do exist. I became more certain of that after reading the Diamond Sutra. It says a bodhisattva that doesn't appear to be one is a real bodhisattva. A world that doesn't appear to be one is a real world. Likewise, you exist because you don't seem to exist. I think it is that which keeps us together. There is less friction between us as time went by. The friction has become... Do you remember that big argument we had? What was it about? It was about some minor habits. Do you remember? It was in Jingmei, with your god sister Yang Pi-ying. I don't remember. You even told me to get off the motorbike. Did I? You were taking me on your motorbike. Sending me home to Jingmei. What was it about? Was it about you spitting? You were eating something and spitting at... We fought over this several times. You kept spitting in a tissue paper. I told you not to do that because it's unhygienic. We quarreled and you became angry. We argued in front of Yang Pi-ying. After that, you took me on your bike. And you told me to get off at a road junction. Or was it me who told you to get off? It's must have been me. Because I have a bike and you don't. That's right. Wait a second... Did I walk home after that? And you left on your bike? So we argued over minor things like that. Everyday issues. So we have a peculiar relationship. You can see it in my films. Having encountered you, your background and personality and being with you ever since. It's as if... Has my sexual orientation ever given you trouble? What? My sexual orientation. Has it ever bothered you? Not really. Why? I'm curious. What has it got to do with me? Except when people are interested in me, they do tend to ask many questions first. But I don't think it's a big issue. So it didn't affect you. I guess it reduced my opportunities. But... It didn't bother you? Bother me? Didn't it? I was only worried about you. Worried about your health. How do you mean? I was worried you'll get sick. You mean AIDS? That's right. How could that happen? It's hard to say... Anything else? And also... This is the first time I talk about this topic. I never did because I didn't feel the need to. I'm just worried you'll get sick. Did you father know? I don't know. I never asked. What about your mother? My mother... She is probably confused. Yes, she's confused. She will never know. I can't tell if she does. Perhaps she's pretending not to know. She would never ask you. Yes, but sometimes she slips off her tongue. One time she was criticizing a homosexual on television. And she stopped all of a sudden when she realized I was there. Why did they let their child work and live with me? I must have changed their mindset. I'm not certain of that. What about your brother? Your brother never mentioned it? No he didn't. We became like a family quite naturally. His children spend time with me too. It's a very natural thing. I never did talk to my family about it either. Except once briefly with my elder sister. We live in such a liberal society now. Why do I want to talk about this issue? I guess I won't have another opportunity. Going back to my sense of belonging. At one point in my life... the gay sauna gave me a sense of belonging. Like the father in The River. I went to one of them, but nothing happened. Because to be intimate with someone there has to be mutual attraction. But to be honest, it often turns out to be... You know that sometimes I'd go to some places... You'll take some risks. Because there are guidebooks to such places overseas. You've been to some of those places with me. I always stood outside. Waiting for you to come out. Or we'd agree on a place to meet. If you didn't show up, I was going to call the police. Those places may be risky but they gave me a feeling. Simply put, they gave me a sense of belonging, like being home. Because I know that in that world, we're all the same. Very often, nothing would happen. But that feeling of restlessness in me would subside. I feel at ease with you because I can tell you these things. I can tell you about these risky places I want to visit. But for a long time, I didn't have a sense of belonging. It's the same when I get into relationships. Sometimes the other party will get jealous of you. They think that I love only you. They will feel that way. Like that guy from Italy. He was angry that I called you daily from Italy. He couldn't understand why. I told him that I must hear your voice. I must make sure you are safe. Our relationship is weird like that. Of course, our phone conversations tend to be short. Just like between a mother and son. Nothing's new! Why did you call? It's expensive to call. That's about it. But you know this is important to me. Just like I called my mother frequently when she was alive. When Lee Yi-cheng was born, my burden was lessened. Because you will call him instead. My god son. But I do ask about you through him. I'd ask him to pass you the phone. It's a habit I can't kick, no matter where I am. I don't understand why you don't telephone. For me, it's absolutely necessary. Simply put... I think life is good now... It's like how I feel after I began keeping dogs. There's love. I miss my dogs too when I'm overseas. It's a good thing the dogs don't talk. You'll understand how I feel if it refuses to answer your phone. We often travel together. When we travel together, I feel safe. Other than my younger sisters or my late mother you're the one I worry about when I'm overseas. I will get a sense that something is hanging. I must have a telephone card when I'm overseas. Ever since we've had cell phones the number of public phones in Paris have reduced. Broken phones are no longer fixed. I like to use telephone cards because they are cheaper. I don't know how to use the internet at all. So you can imagine how I was when I was in Europe. I remember when I was in Marseilles for a film festival. A festival staff passed by me on the street and asked me what I was doing. I said I was using the public phone. That's the way I am. So what is our relationship like? You have too many phone calls to make. Even when I travel with you, you'll always buy a phone card. If I was in a relationship, I'd need to phone that person. If I wasn't, I will only call you! Isn't that right? I'd call you even if I was in a relationship! Anyway, the phone is your only entertainment at night. What? It's true! It's the same when you're at home. Every time I walked by your room, you'll be on the phone. You never seem to stop. Nonsense! You rarely stop. I talk on the phone less these days. I suppose I need someone to talk to. That's right. What about you? Always on the computer. - I have a different way of keeping in touch. - What is it? You use the phone, I use the internet. It's the same. I don't have any friends here in the mountain. What about before? It's the same. You were always on the internet. I used to play internet games. Not anymore. I only surf the internet now. Let me ask you something serious. Will you cry when I pass away? I guess so. What will you do if I go first? I don't know how to talk about this. You don't ever think about it? After my father passed away, I seldom think about him. Why? Because it made me sad. Why think about sad things? I made What Time Is It There because of your father's death. I saw that you were miserable for almost half a year. We were traveling to many film festivals at that time. Your misery made me sad too. I wanted to find a way for you to walk out of it. I felt that making a film might be a good way. So I made What Time Is It There. So... You won't think about things like that? I try not to. I don't dwell on it. Do you want to meet me again in your next life? That's too far away. I'm such a romantic. Am I declaring my love to him? Do you want to meet me? In my next life? No. I don't think about that. Do you wish to meet me? Should we decide on a secret signal? Like in the movie, Rouge. I believe that we have a predestined relationship. We don't need to understand each other much to live together. It doesn't matter what others say. We have a simple life together. For example, when we share a hotel room. Some festivals are poorer and can only offer one room. We don't even close the bathroom door. I can walk around without my clothes on. Strangely, we don't feel awkward about it. It is quite peculiar. This is definitely not a romantic relationship. Romantic relationships may not even be like this. It feels closer, like family. Yet we are not related. In our worst of times, when we were attacked by others. Like in our company back then. I said you can kill me, but you can't take Lee Kang Sheng away. Why? Because you are like a tumor in my body. It's benign, but if you cut it, I will bleed and feel pain. You can't cut it. I find it interesting how people accept the way we are. Including those film distributors or investors. They never question us. They never question why the main actor has to be you. We seldom talk about this issue. What do you think of it? Actually, it's not good for me. What do you mean? Because they should be allowed to request for another actor. What do you mean? They never asked. They will never make such a request. They don't ask because they know you won't agree. Many people want to work with you. I know, and I am attracted by their offers. But I have no choice. I don't have that many films to make. You understand? I began to feel that I am making films because of you. That's how I feel. I actually dread making films, especially in recent years. I feel tired or lazy or frustrated. The constant anxiety. But if it's with you, I'll be able to do it. Now, I feel safe and relaxed. I don't feel the need to make many more films. I can stop making films completely. I am satisfied to just film you walking. I feel that I have found a comfortable place in my life. I am no longer worried about trying to make ends meet. The reason is because I am getting older. There are lesser things I want to do now. My main focus is on creating works involving you. That's all. You should slowly decrease your workload. Since we moved here, you haven't even gone out for a walk. You are always in the house. Yes, I am lazy. I've been everywhere around here. I am so lazy. But I did go down with you one time! Only once. I grow crops in the back. Trees and vegetables. I am happy! I walk the dog and walk everywhere. I haven't left the mountain but I've explored the vicinity. I feel a sense of stability. I wish I could live a little longer. I wish to enjoy this life a little more. It feels a little like my childhood. What I find interesting is... It actually takes the form of a folk legend. All my films deal with the age-old theme of morality. Like the relationship between Nezha and his father or between him and the era he lived in. Family ties remain even if you cut them... Even when Nezha returned his body to his parents the ties remain, like when you cut a lotus root in half. Nezha's other body is made of lotus root. So it literally is as the Chinese idiom says. There are things in this world that he couldn't let go of. If you look at my life on the whole I have parents and siblings. I've also had lovers in the past. But the one person I can't bear to let go of is Lee Kang Sheng. It's strange. I can't shift my camera lens away from him. I can't help but continue filming him. It's as if the camera were my secret weapon and I will only use it for him. I don't know how he feels. But I'm very certain how I feel. He is the most important person in my work and in my life. So whenever I think about death my first thought is how would he feel about it? How would he feel if I were to leave? It may not be death. What if I simply left him. How would he feel? My life is good now. And I want to keep it that way. I don't want to do anything except go on with my life with him. It's interesting because it is like a return to... the way that I was with my grandfather. I loved my grandpa very much. I can't explain that love. We held hands when we slept together. I was around three or four or five. There was no need to know him. He was simply an old man. And he doted on me. And one day, he just died. No wait, before that we were separated for a while. My father took me home from him when I was in grade four. We were separated for more than a year. He only came to visit during the school vacation. But during school semesters... My relationship with my grandpa was very special. I thought about him every day for an hour or two before I fell asleep. Which is why I don't fall sleep easily. My mind is always active. I was simply longing for that one person. I only missed him, not my grandmother even though she doted on me too. I would stick his photograph on the wall. I would imagine being with him in the mountain. Living the life that we have now. Growing vegetables and doing other things together. Sometimes I'd weep. It's actually quite abnormal. I was around fifth or sixth grade. My grandpa passed away a few years later. This was an important period in my memory. It felt like a kind of rebellion. I imagined that we were running away together. So when I look at the life we have in this world I begin to have this feeling... that we are very lucky to be working together. Even though we still have some minor problems. I feel that we are doing relatively well. I feel that what I have right now is the life with Lee Kang Sheng that I have dreamt about. I know that this could be short-lived. Perhaps I may die suddenly. When I look back and ask myself if I have wasted my life I know that I have not. Sometimes I'd think from your perspective. And I feel that you haven't wasted your life either. Even though you are not competitive and you don't have big ambitions or desires. Actually, I'm not ambitious either. I found a little fame by chance and have been doing what I do by chance too. But there must be a reason why God made it that way. You know what I mean? I was very happy when someone called you Master Taigu that day. I figured I must be like Master Taigu too then. Since we live in this world, we must help the world a little. So I am very proud of the work we've done in this lifetime. I'm sure you feel this way when you look at our body of work. Or when we attend retrospective screenings or film festivals. Or when we get good reviews from others. For example, two days ago, I received a book from the UK. It's published by the Oxford University Press. A book about our films, our cinema of slowness. I couldn't understand it as it was in English. But I felt proud to have a book like that about us. Last year, there was another book from China by Song-Yong Sing. The recognition for our work seems to come pretty late. But then again, not really. At least we are getting recognition in this lifetime. We often watch old classic films ourselves. I can imagine our films being appreciated in the same way by others. Which is why I'm often happy for you. Really. It's hard to explain. I recently attended a talk organized by INK Publishing with two or three hundred listeners. I told them that Lee Kang Sheng is very important. But I find it hard to explain clearly. I told them that you are a Taiwanese kid who didn't have the attributes of a mainstream actor. You didn't have the typical conditions to be a famous star. But think about his position in the world of cinema today. I don't have to explain further. You should know what I mean. You may have been uncertain about making my films before. The income is little and barely enough. So why do it? It actually suits your personality. And little by little we got to where we are. I think it's a terrific plan by God. I would have left if it didn't suit my personality. No, I meant that it didn't suit your needs. It does suit your personality, very much. I understand the way you are. Which is why I think we're a match made in heaven. You don't have any desires, and I want to do it my own way. We often had to put up with loneliness. But we've also received a lot of praise and positive feedback. We've received help from many people. Basically, I feel that this life is almost complete. This has been a wonderful relationship. I am happy to continue this way in our remaining years. I feel more confident. Because I can see your confidence too. Especially during The Monk From Tang Dynasty or the slow-walking films. I can see that confidence in your calmness. Except for your physical fatigue... I used to sense a bit of impatience in you but not anymore. I'll say 'roll camera, begin walking', and you'd do it. I suddenly felt that there was no need for any NGs. Whether your walking is good or bad, you are still walking. With The Monk From Tang Dynasty, I felt that we had the chance to do something... How should I put it? God has given us an interesting method of expression. Something for the world to see. This method goes beyond all logical expectations. You never asked me why you had to play Xuanzang this way. It doesn't seem to be about Xuanzang, but it is. Because... that is your version of Xuanzang. Yes, it is my Xuanzang. Why do we need to start with something we understand? Why can't we reinterpret from scratch? Why can't it come as a result of our own understanding? But I need you in order to express it. Whenever I see you rehearse at the theatre. I know it is difficult for you, but I am happy. I know the work will be done. I don't know, I feel that... This is too strange to be true. How can there be such an actor or person in my life creating such performances in my work. Do you have any questions for me? No... Do you still want a sports car? Sure I do. I don't know when I will die either. I would like to experience it once. Why don't I ever feel that way? Because you don't even know how to drive! You only know how to ride the motorbike. I'm too lazy to even ride the bike these days. It's good to have you as my chauffeur. What else? Any other questions or comments? Or advice for me? You better not... You won't listen to my advice anyway. You seek your own trouble. I don't anymore. But you are still so busy. Busy? Yes. You'll find lots of things to do. I don't anymore. I'm merely fulfilling all the promises I made before. What else do you want to say? We're almost done. Xiaokang, do you worry that he will be lonely when he gets old? I suppose I will take care of him. I'm glad to hear that. I believe they will take care of me. Including my godson, his nephew. I believe he will do that. I need to earn more money so I can hire a nurse for you. Haven't I already bought insurance? You still need a nurse to look after you! In case I'm away for work. OK then. What else? We won't have a lot of chances to talk like this again. Says who? We can talk anytime. Do you wish that he'd find a companion soon? Him? Of course. There's no one. I've given up. He's too picky. How so? Tell them. How picky are you? Tell us what kind of partner you're looking for. Someone who attracts me of course! What about you? Can't you say something? I often advice you not to get married. The main reason is that you are getting old. If you were to go by the usual expectation where one gets married and has children, I think you're too old. If you don't want kids, it doesn't matter. Will you get married? I don't know. Do you want to get married? Not at the moment. Maybe when the time comes. It's about time you decided. You are already past forty. Actually, it doesn't matter. That's right. I can get married the day before I die. As long as the other party is willing. Why should someone marry you right before you die? Because she can inherit my possessions! I see... Alright. What else? We haven't said much. Xiaokang, Tsai said he won't be making films anymore. How do you feel about that? I will continue making films on his behalf. He can tell me what he wants to make. But it will frustrate me. If I do that, he will want to be involved as well. That's right, I will worry. Don't wait till I get a stroke and can't say anything. You might even recover from your stroke. Xiaokang... let me think... We don't have to talk about your performance... Xiaokang, how do you feel about moving here? Before, when I was living in Yong He, I often felt trapped. Whenever I got home, I'd go straight to my room. I'll chat with my mom during dinner. But I'm usually in my room, roughly of this size. Here, I can go anywhere I want. Do you enjoy my cooking? It's so-so. There isn't much variety. Nothing has dazzled me so far. I prefer the feeling of having breakfast. Even though it is only toast. I suppose it's because they're not made by me. A simple toast with jam. I'll eat it in the backyard. It feels good. Being with you, I've become careful when ordering food at the restaurant. I make sure I order food that you like and not too much. How do you find the films we've made together? How I find them? It's hard to express in words. You need to feel it yourself, using your own life experience. Do you like them? I do feel something when I watch them. But... it's not a question of liking or not. It's a special film viewing experience. It often is different from the way I felt when I was acting. It feels more complete and... What do you mean by 'complete'? I mean... I am only aware of my part when I'm acting. I am not certain about what comes before or after. Especially since your script is so scant. What I mean is, I know my portions well. But when the other elements are cut together you can truly feel the impact of the film. That's because I never tell you what I'm trying to express. But I think you do know, don't you? I'm not sure you do yourself. Of course I do! I'm very certain myself. - That's for sure. - Is that so? Yes, but how to express it depends on you guys. You know it when you're editing. Yes, and even in front of the monitor during filming. Once I see you've given me something good, I am satisfied. Of course, sometimes there are many NGs when I'm not sure. When that happens, I'd usually settle for something that works. But I'd usually end up not using the shot. So... how do you see filmmaking? You have been in the business for so long. It's just a way of life, a way to make a living. What do you think you have expressed? What have our films helped you to express? Because my films have basically followed you. They've been made because of your qualities. Anything? I don't think it helped me express anything. Rather, it has helped people who are like me to express their sense of frustration with life or their situation. Or some other circumstances in their life. Life goes on, albeit with a sense of helplessness. How do you think you have done? Or how have we done? Age plays a factor in the process. From Rebels of the Neon God to The River to The Hole. Some people say that because you won an award for Stray Dogs... Of course, the film was directly focused on you. And the story was easier to comprehend. People accepted it and suddenly felt you were a great actor. But some discerning viewers will say that it was not a matter of technique, but simply of age and experience. Not everyone can take on this role. Like the scene where you ate a cabbage or sang the poem. Or smoked or drank alcohol. I was deeply moved when I saw it on the monitor. The other thing is life experience. Do you see your own transformation since Rebels? It's strange for an actor to see himself on the screen. It's not just a single performance, but an entire journey. It may be different from the way audiences see it. How do you see it? I guess it's life experience plus my age. You are like... Like when I give speeches these days, I don't even prepare. Is it the same way you approach acting these days? In my case, because of my experience I know what works, so I can do it on the fly. But I'd do it slightly differently each time. Of course, there'll always be new additions to my experiences. New thoughts or feelings. Are you an actor like that? I'm always searching for different possibilities. I'll try and give you what you want. But I'll also try and find different ways of doing it. That's why I'm often surprised by you. Like that cabbage scene. I was deeply moved during filming. Because I didn't know how you'd handle it, I was worried. It's a heavy scene. If it's too much, it will feel like a false performance. But it does require a performance of some kind. It feels a little like theatre, because it's set up that way. But it's through a lens, which means it's closer. So it's important that it looks realistic. That's why I was pleasantly surprised. You hit the mark on the first take and I said OK. It's hard to imagine sometimes... Like Yang Kuei-mei, when we were making Face... The scene with the fridge. She was getting ready on her own. I asked if she was ready and she said yes. I thought we needed a few takes. Because there were several other actors to coordinate like Shiang-chyi and Fanny Ardant. But Yang Kuei-mei did it in one take, just like you. Usually you guys can do the difficult scenes in one take. Sometimes I think you guys are amazing. How you control the timing and emotions, etc. That's why I can't be an actor, because I can't do that. I think I will be too aware of the situation. How did you enter it? I've never asked you this. Tell me. How do I enter it? Yes, with the cabbage. How did you enter the situation? I told you that it represented a woman whom you hate. Or a woman you used to love. That's all I said. You had to deal with it and eat it. I knew it was impossible for you to finish it in such a short time. I think it requires improvisation. There is nothing to prepare. You can't possibly rehearse that. There will be obstacles when eating that cabbage. You may not be able to swallow it, or... Anyway, many emotions began to emerge in that scene. I held it inside me until a certain breaking point. Too much thoughts will distract me from my performance. So you were thinking. Yes, plus the difficulty of eating a cabbage itself. And you refused to yell cut. Sometimes my emotions got cut off. But the tension is at its peak at that point. It needed to be released. So I just kept going with it. Was it over as soon as I yelled cut? It subsided after you yelled cut. It went away after that. At a certain stage, you can enter and withdraw easily. So acting is a little like being possessed by spirits. It feels like that sometimes. I feel that your walking is also like being possessed. I feel that way. As a director, I look at things differently than the audience. I will gauge your energy level. You know what I mean? I will gauge if you are too tired from such a long walk. Like that staircase you climbed in Journey to the West. I wasn't sure how long you could do it for. But what impresses me about you is that you'll never stop on your own. Unless you meet with a real obstacle that we can all see. Basically you never stopped. By the time we did Journey to the West I told you that I won't yell 'cut' for NG. You should be able to do it in one take. I came to that decision after some time. I adjusted myself. I began to accept everything you gave me. Even if there was some minor mistakes. Because I can decide to cut out that bit. So I still insist that you, as an actor... You are different from other actors. Because you know... I can't speak for other actors. Perhaps they have their own way. Perhaps they will think of it as work, or as a task. Something they can simply complete and be done with. But not in your case, because you can't stop. It is a situation or a circumstance where you can only stop when someone says so. I would like to enjoy more and do things that make me happy. As for you... You should rest more and do the things you enjoy. What I mean is, don't worry about me so much. I know my limits. Sure. But how can I not worry? I know my limits too. But I will always keep a look out. But you still have to let me know if anything happens. Like what I told Lee Yi-cheng. I told him that no matter what happens in school, no matter how serious it is, he has to tell me in the end. It will put my mind at ease that I can give you my advice. Like the way I tell you about my problems. I can't be like that with my own family. Actually... Lately, I feel that I am getting old. I am less passionate about certain things. Less enthusiastic. I'm also not concerned about my romantic life anymore. One of my younger sisters has become a Buddhist nun. I may not become a monk, but I think that's life... Your don't need another person. You know? You still need someone. No, I disagree. Look at Xuanzang. That's the concept I believe in. A lone person wandering through life, facing a desert. There's nothing wrong with him. He had the Buddha in his mind. Of course, it's always good to have someone. But I think... what I have with you counts as well. We are together in a way. And I accept your relationships too, don't I? I accept that you're with Shuping. Or anyone else you've been with in the past. Do you remember sometimes... Like that day when I laid on your bed and you said Shuping is a neat freak. I got up immediately, but I sensed she wasn't happy. I felt that way for a few days afterwards. But I accept that. I won't criticize her or anything. You know what I mean? Everyone has his or her own habits. It's her own space. When she's not around and you let me lie down, I was happy. I know that you understand that we're not like that. So I am very accepting. For example, I can't stand how talkative your mother is. But I still see her as my elder. As long as she doesn't bother me, or I can walk away. Sometimes I'd tell her to keep it down. It's good that we are not that close. It reduces friction. I'd never argue with her. You know the way I am. I get over arguments easily. I understand your mother too, so there's no problem. You just have to let her know. This is how we get along. But I'm very satisfied with my life now. The circumstance we are in now. Look at how simple our stage play is. I don't think someone else would dare to attempt that. But we did, and we did it happily. Almost without constraint, with absolute freedom. A stage play with a large sheet of paper. You're the only actor and there is no dialogue. Just you walking, sleeping. I did chant the Heart Sutra. Right. I am happy when you chant the Heart Sutra. Do you go vegetarian when you perform? For that scene. I just eat bread. In Europe, I can only eat salad. Or bread with jam. Besides, I have to eat pastry and dates in the play. That's right, so you can't eat too much. Which is your favorite country? We've been to so many. Thailand, I suppose. Why? Because it's more affordable. You mean the food? Yes, and I can spend freely. It hurts less. But otherwise, I like the European countries. Where? Which one? Which one... There are many great places in Europe. For example? Do you remember any? Where have we been? Venice, for instance. But Europe is too expensive. We've been to Venice too many times. Where else? I've been to this place... can't remember... The place with the amazing caves. What is it called? Slovenia... Slovenia. The cave was wonderful. Where else? I find Dubai rather dull. But I... Turkey is not bad. Dubai is... other than the boring market... It is still pretty unique. Yes, it was quite fun. It felt different to be in a place like Dubai. It may be dull, but look how fast their taxis go. And all those pretentious looking hotels. We visited those places on a boat. They are all artificial. What about Spain? Spain and Portugal were great. We had fish every day. What else... What fish? We had it every day, with Maria. You were there, weren't you? Yes, we had fish and shrimp. Seafood. You liked Argentina too. Argentina was alright. You had Mate tea. You've been to Australia too. One time. Sydney, wasn't it? A few years ago. Where else was fun? Israel. Yes, Israel was great. You remember the sound of the plane? At the Black Sea. Dead Sea. Floating in the water. You've been to Estonia, haven't you? Japan was fun too. Of course. And Korea. Did you go to Jeju? Jeju Island? Yes, for the Asian Pacific Film Festival. I remember Jeju Island clearly. It was my first time in a strange country. No one spoke Chinese. There were Chinese! I couldn't understand those circles and squares. I remember something very clearly. One time we landed at the wrong airport in Nantes. Our driver drove for two hours in the dense fog. And he didn't talk to us at all. We didn't know where he was taking us. We kept chattering in the back seat. Wondering where we were or where we were going. Later we realized the plane had landed at the wrong airport. They sent a taxi to pick us up. Strange... I really don't know what film we should make next. I don't think there's any left. Short films perhaps. Didn't you want to paint? I feel that there's no need to finish everything. Time is running out anyway. My paintings may become expensive because there are few. I can sell them and leave you the money. You even wanted to have a painting studio. Why give them to me? I can't sell them. You can sell them. I don't need the money, unless someone offers billions. Billions? I'll wait till it reaches that value. That's impossible. That's why I won't sell them! How can my paintings possibly be worth that much? It's meaningless to sell them for less. That's true. It may be worth more during Lee Yi-cheng's time. But not billions. I'm satisfied with what I have. I'm happier this way. Even billionaires may not really be happy. Why aren't they happy? Because they will always want more. Billions turn into hundreds of billions. Terry Gou is so old, yet he's still working so hard. Even Shi Zhengrong has returned to Acer. He had retired earlier. Is he old? More than seventy years old. That's his life. I guess we are well suited for retired life. I've retired long ago. I am retiring soon too. What bliss. Filming is only an interest for me now. You may be the strangest actor ever. No one is sure if you're acting or not acting. No one else is like me. Spending time with my dogs and my crops. Sometimes I have to deal with dog poo. I don't think there's another director like me who cooks and prepares ingredients for the café at Zhongshan Hall. I even baked cookies and prepared set meals in the past. Which director does as much as me? It has nothing to do with filmmaking. It's about making a living. That's why I want to stop. My health is suffering. No other director has to sell tickets to his own film. Even you guys have to go out and sell tickets on the street. That's why people are afraid to see us. They are not afraid. They respect us. Some of them are afraid. They avoid me. You mean they're afraid you'll make them buy tickets? They are afraid I'll ask them to buy in bulk. No other director or actor in the world will go around giving more than two hundred talks in under two months just to sell ten thousand movie tickets. How miserable! The director of that music video said he attended our talk before. Really? He was applying for a Masters program and was afraid he won't be admitted. He asked me to write him a testimonial. I told him he'll definitely get in! Did he get in? Yes he did. So now he wants you to be in a music video? That's right. So you see, these people who came to our talks or bought tickets from us in the street... It's a strange experience. Strange... They are like seeds we planted that later bloom and bear fruits. If I die, you must continue to chant scriptures. That's all I ask for. Because they work. I'll chant for you. It's not for me. You must read the text. You must try and understand its meaning. You will understand a lot of things in life. Then you will know how to deal with sufferings in life. - The scripture will help you see things more clearly. - I will. Then you will feel free. You will be less troubled. I've always been like that. Yes, but you still need it. Think about the strange coincidences. Do you remember when we first chanted the Heart Sutra? Do you? It was when Tian Shi"s mother passed away. It was the first time I saw you chanting so devotedly. Heart Sutra was also part of your performance in Only You. We even made it into a CD. I think it's destiny. And now you know it by heart. I also used it in My Stinking Kid. It was used very well and even won an award. So you see, it seems to have been destined... I don't know... I think you have... what do you call it? The roots of wisdom. It seems that when the right conditions arise, you'll get it. It's always like that. My younger brothers wouldn't even bother. They went to see my sister, who had become a nun. They finally went to the temple. But they kept complaining afterwards. Saying that it's boring and that they'll never go again. I told them off. They are unable to accept such things. But we are not like that. We are more open and accepting of things, good or bad. When ticket sales was poor, we went out to sell tickets. How torturous was that experience. We met positive and negative response. Some people bought tickets. We give a talk to say 300 and a hundred bought tickets. They'd line up for our autograph or a photo taken. You were there too. Some people would criticize you or reject you. Before my mother passed away, I was selling tickets for Help Me Eros. I got a call from the hospital saying she won't make it. I rushed back from Kaohsiung. I was mad about that last ticket I was trying to sell. That person had the cheek to ask if he can buy one ticket for two. It's like the work of a missionary. Or an ascetic. Not an ascetic. A preacher. Yes, I think so too. That's what we've been doing. People like your brother will never accept your films. They reject anything that's different. He needs to find a different way. He doesn't have to accept my films. I'd rather he accept a sutra or a scripture. They need something to help them understand life. That's why I want you to continue chanting scripture. Because everyone has blind spots and things they can't let go of. I don't wish for you to be like that. Having or not having is not important. Life is like that. It's good enough. Think about it. It really is enough. I think we can quit at any time. It really is enough. Stray Dogs is going to the art museum. Aren't you proud? I know. It's enough. It doesn't matter what comes out of it. Someone out there is always responding to our work. I'm thankful for these people. I'm also thankful to Shiang-chyi, Lu Yi-ching, Yang Kuei-mei and Liao Penjung. They have been with us all this while. You know what I mean? They will always come when we need them. Including those overseas like Vincent Wang. They've been with us for more than ten years. Alright... Look at this house. It belongs to us now. But it is only temporary. That's right. It belonged to someone else, but now it's abandoned. You must understand that nothing is permanent. Our relationship is also not permanent. It's a beautiful impermanent relationship. And it's for so long. It's wonderful! I wish it can be longer, so I hope to meet you in my next life. I'll be the director and you'll be the actor in our next lives. Let's not be in this line anymore. But OK. Do you need me to bare my body? It's enough. Let's wait for the light to disappear. The next life... That's why I like ruins. Like I said, this world is an illusion. Everything is an illusion. What has it got to do with that? Ruins are the most real. Everything falls into ruins one day. People too. Like how we used to have great skin. From ruins comes... From ruins comes birth, and from birth comes death. I love ruins. Our films are all ruins. It will look better with makeup. You mean this house? It's beautiful! It's beautiful in an abandoned way. A house is beautiful because of its surroundings. Right? If you take care of it, a simple house can be beautiful. Likewise, an expensive house can be ugly too. Depends how you use it. So what is beauty and ugliness? There are internet users in China who call you a potato farmer. A farmer who grows sweet potato. Sweet potato? They say you ugly, like a farmer. But why are farmers necessarily ugly? It's a question of stereotype. I don't know how their value system became like that. To me, most people are beautiful. Everyone is beautiful in their own way. That's what our films are about. Do you think these plants understand us? They seem to be observing us. Is your neck better? My neck... It looks a lot better. As long as I stay relaxed. Do you still watch TV in bed? Rarely. It's the worst habit. I am feeling it myself. You should stop watching TV in bed. Yes, I need to change my position. You talk on the phone in bed too. That's bad. When I finish all my projects, my cooking will improve. You hear me? I'm too busy now to cook properly. Alright. Let's go. Look. How beautiful... Look out for that pen. I don't know what I was talking about...
