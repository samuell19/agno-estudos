Shit! I am so sorry. Sure, whatever it is, it was so important that you couldn't tell me over the phone but not so important you couldn't be, oh, a half hour late. I'm getting a divorce, Julie. I told him that I was leaving and that I was taking Nicky. He hit me. How about Nicholas? The lawyers wrote up a temporary agreement. This can't be my life, Julie. It just can't. Excuse me? Yeah? I'm house sitting for Migget. Could you tell me what's going on? Oh, the Olsons, all of them. Killed while they slept. Killed? Butchered, from what I hear. How could something like that happen here? While we slept? This is a nice neighborhood. Oh, God. Morning Folks. You all know the Olsons? Of course. Who are you? Detective Peters. Homicide, of course. Either of you hear or see anything out of the ordinary last night? Why yes. There was a car fulL of raving psychopaths parked in front of the house around midnight, but I thought if we left them alone, they'd just... Ma'am, I need to know if you saw or heard anything unusual last night. Don't you think I would have called the police in that case? Maybe, maybe not. It may not have struck you as strange, but maybe now, with what's happened, What exactly happened? Your neighbors have been murdered, Ma'am. I can't tell you any more than that right now. If anything comes to mind, give me a ring huh? That's all? That's all the questions you're going to ask us? Sorry. Did either one of you happen to kill the Olsons? Okay, thanks. One of my guys will be by to take your names. I'm sorry, Detective, I'm really late. Here. This has my name and cell phone number on it. I'm house sitting here for the next couple of weeks. An artist, huh? You don't much look like an artist. Says Magnum P.I. How long you been house sitting? About four, no, five nights. I may have to come by and ask you a few questions, Miss Blodgett. Sure, I understand. Well, it was really nice meeting you, I'm really late right now though. Okay, Honey. Oh I'm Gale, Gale Wroten. Hey, sorry I'm late. You'll never believe the morning I'm having. No worries, everything's going pretty okay. Lynn! Some of these new pieces of yours are amazing! You've been doing great work lately. Fabulous stuff. Thanks, Phil. And thank you so much for all of this. It's my pleasure. What do you think? Should we expect a crowd tonight? I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. How on earth did you get all these people here? I posted it on their message board. But, if they hate clowns, then why are they here? It's a love hate thing. So what do you think? I'm not an art critic or anything... Who is? I don't know what the clown fetish is all about. I think the artist has issues. Oh? Well, they're clowns, for chrissakes. But hers are all so, scary. But you're no art critic. No, Tucker Reid. My friends call me Tuck. Lynn... Blodgett, I know. I saw your picture in the program. I didn't want to blow your cover. Not right away anyway. So what do you really think? They're great. You've still got issues, but, I think they're phenomenal. So, what brought you here tonight? This is the best gallery in Baltimore. I've bought a couple of pieces here. Well, I hope you have a good time. Can I get your autograph later? Sure, hang around. I'll be back. Lynn, there you are. What the hell are you doing here? What? What's the matter? Who's taking care of Nicky? He's in great hands, don't worry. So why are you here? To see your new exhibit, of course. Bert, what the hell is wrong with you? We're not friends. You filed for divorce. Only because you were going to. We're not doing this here. Please leave. Don't get all apoplectic on me. I didn't realize you were going to get so upset. Why wouldn't I? This is an important night to me. Fine, I'll leave. Thanks. There she is. Can I get that autograph now? But that's... Your new admirer has just purchased your most expensive piece, My Dear. That's eight thousand dollars. And worth every penny. Go ahead and wrap it up. I'll have her autograph it once it's hanging up in my house. Oh, oh, of course. Do you mind if I ask what it is that you do, Tuck? You wanna see? Well I guess that depends on what it is that you do. I've got to get some tape in the other room. Seriously, you want to see what I do, my office isn't very far away. Okay. But only because you just paid my rent for the next three months. Phillip, I'll be back. This is it. What exactly do you do? Look at the pictures. I still don't get it. My company designs roller coasters. Disney, King's Dominion, Busch Gardens, you name it. I've got a coaster there. How old are you? How old are you? Touche. That's me. No. Every time they finish a new coaster of mine, I like to stand at the highest point. You're out of your mind. Impressed? I don't really like roller coasters. How do you feel about shuffleboard? Can I get you a beer? Sure. Hello? Lynn? Phillip? What are you doing up this late? You had me worried sick. I've called ten times since 11 o'clock. Why? You leave the exhibit with some strange man you don't even know, and you wonder why I'm worrying? You're right. I'm sorry. Where have you been all this time? Long story. Long long story. You'll never believe what happened. What, what happened? Lynn, hello? Lynn? Lynn? Hello, hello? Lynn? Hello, hello, hello? Miss Blodgett, can you hear me? Ma'am, can you hear me? Ma'am, can you hear me? Ma'am, can you hear me? Yes. Okay, are you with me now? Yeah. Let me help you sit up. Ma'am, do you feel okay? Does anything hurt? No, I'm okay. Tell me, did you hit your head when you fell? No, I don't think so. Would you like to go to the hospital? No, I'm okay. Can you tell me what happened? There was someone outside my back door. Right here? Yes. It was open when we got here. We'll search the house. I don't think there's anyone here though. How did you know to come? A friend of yours called. Said you were talking on the phone and it sounded like you collapsed. Can you describe the guy that was outside your door? He was dressed like a clown. What? A what? 'Scuse me a minute. She says she's seeing clowns outside her window. Clowns? 10-96. Don't you ever sleep? Not so much. You say you saw someone outside? Yes, here was someone standing at my back door when I turned on the light. And was he black or white? He was a clown. A clown? Yes. You're telling me you saw a clown outside your window at one a.m.? Yes. Was he lost? Wandered away from Barnum & Bailey's and got trapped in suburbia? This a P.R. stunt? What? I know what you do for a living, Miss Blodgett. You paint pictures of clowns. This some kind of publicity stunt? Does it look like a publicity stunt? No, but looks can be deceiving. That's great. How profound. I'd like you to leave. There's no need to be rude. The house is all clear. I'm just saying, if this is some kind of stunt, it's a serious crime to call the police. I didn't call the police. I know, your friend did. The one who owns the gallery full of your clown paintings. I'll be talking to you. I've got a few more questions I'd like to ask. Night. Hey, what's going on? Have you ever been spanked by a clown, Miss Blodgett? Excuse me? My father. He used to be a clown for neighborhood birthday parties. A very strange thing. This man who brings joy and smiles to everyone around him, is also the man who comes home and spanks you. Not happy to do it, mind you, but doing his duty as a father punishing a son. You paint magnificently. I don't like the ones with the frightening clowns though. I don't know why you waste your time with those. I want you to paint a picture of my father. Mr. Parrish, I'm sorry, I don't do commission pieces... 10 thousand dollars. Cash if you'd like. I don't, I mean, I could sell you that one for a lot less... No, I want an original painting of my father and I need it in three days. That's just impossible. I can recommend a number of excellent painters... No, it has to be you. I'm sorry, I just can't. 20 thousand dollars. That's my final offer. You don't understand... Lynn, could I speak to you for a moment? Can you keep an eye on him for a second? I can't, Phillip. I just don't have the time. Make the time. You can't be too busy for that kind of money. I am. I'm getting divorced. You've got to think this through, Lynn. Can you imagine what this is going to mean for your other paintings? For your reputation? You won't just be consigned to showing your paintings in my gallery, you'll be all over the country. I'm not sure I can do it. Of course you can. You'll do it? I can't promise you I'll get it done. Excellent. My phone number is on the back. Give me a call me when you're finished and let me know how you'd like the payment. Good day. 20 thousand dollars, that'll buy a lot of bandwidth. Tres geek, huh? Yeah. What happened last night? I called but the police wouldn't tell me anything. I'm sorry. What? What happened? You'll never believe it. Get me some coffee and I'll tell you about it. I don't know why. Voices? No voices. No more voices. Better. Kill her. Pain. Stop. Kill her, I'll be cured. He talks to me. Wanna get better. Get! Better. Get better! Get better! Get better! Get better! What happened when I called you? I don't know. I guess it all just caught up to me. I must have passed out. You need to start taking it easy, Lynn. And I don't think that includes leaving with strange men at night. Is that you, Dad? He's right. You should stay away from that guy. Give me his phone number, I'll pass him the message. Anyway, I have to get going. Are you sure you're okay watching him for an hour? Not a problem. Great, thanks. What exactly is supposed to happen at this mediation? I'm not sure. I think we need to sit down and discuss who gets what, and what his visitation rights are going to be. Are you out of your fucking mind? Mind the language please. That's what we want. Sole custody of Nicholas. Half of the ownership of every painting you've created since you married, or half the price if you've sold them already. You can keep your car. Bert won't ask for any palimony, but you'll have to pay child support. I can't believe I'm hearing this. Marty? That's not going to fly, Guys. Lynn gets sole custody. Full alimony and child support. Bert can keep his house... The house was his before the marriage. It's not in her name at all. Our terms aren't negotiable, Marty. Your client has no home, very unstable for the child. If she tries to buy one before the divorce goes through, we'll pursue half of it. You don't want to play hardball with me. I'm short stop in the majors, you're left field in the minors. We just want a fair deal, Osbourne. That's all we're looking for. We're offering you a fair deal. He wants her to pay child support? He's a doctor, for god sakes. He's been out of work for over six months. What? What has he been doing? It's not your business. He's still my husband, you son of a bitch... Please, Miss. No, I want an answer! What has be been doing every day for the past six months if he wasn't going to work? Let's call it a day. Bullshit! Let's meet on Monday once everyone's had a chance to cool down. Sounds good. I'll fax our terms to your office. You do have a fax machine? Of course. You really stuck it to him, Marty. What, what do you mean? I'm not losing Nicholas. I can't lose him. It'll be all right. We'll get him. (Voices) You need to help her, watch her. No more pain. No more. You are getting better. You want to get better, don't you? You are getting better. Not much longer and you'll be completely cured. But first, take the van. The murder van? Do not kill her. Follow her. Frighten her. Make her doubt her sanity. But do not harm her yet. Let no one else see you. Go. I'm telling you, he's going for full custody, Julie. He wants me to pay him. That bastard. God, I feel like I'm having a nervous breakdown. I'm telling you, there was a clown outside my door last night. You said that. You were probably just exhausted. I feel like I'm living in a nightmare. Just take some deep breaths. So what are you gonna do? I'm going to paint that picture for Mr. Parrish. Then I'm going to use that money to hire the best attorney in town to kick his lawyer's ass! That a girl! Hey, I got someone calling on the other line, could be my lawyer. Can I call you back? All right, talk to you soon. Bye. Hello? Lynn, it's Tuck. Hi, how are you? I was gonna ask you the same thing. I'm okay. It's just that, about last night, there's just, there's other things. Wanna do something strange? Grab your camera. So where are you taking me? You'll see. Where are we? It's called The Land Of Myth. They closed it down about fifteen years ago. My God, I've been here before. As a kid. Yeah me too. It was popular for a while. Kind of creepy now, isn't it? To tell you the truth, I thought it was kind of creepy back then. Listen, I have to level with you. My life is kind of a train wreck right now. What's the problem? It's really complicated. You're getting divorced. What's complicated? You asked for it. And he's trying to take my son away from me. I need some time before I can even, you know. I should have known, he was a man with a cat. Single men with cats are bad news. At least, that's what the magazines say. Miss Blodgett? How you doing? Fine. Detective Peters, Homicide. Homicide? Yeah, that's when somebody dies. Thanks. There was a murder two doors down a couple of nights ago and now Miss Blodgett is seeing clowns in her backyard. Takes a clown to catch a clown, huh? Nice ride. What is it you do, Mister? Ah, a little of this, a little of that. Yeah, so where were you two nights ago? You know, why don't you give my secretary a call and have her check my schedule for you? Who's your friend? Can I help you with something? I don't know yet. So why are you here? I'm a detective, I'm detecting. And what are you detecting? I have a funny feeling about you, Miss Blodgett. Well. Try and keep it in your pants, would you? For God's sake, Whoa. Whoa. What the hell are you supposed to be? Better. Ugh! Ow! No, please! No! Hi. You're probably getting sick of me, aren't you? Well, now that you mention it. I called earlier, Yeah, I was taking Nicky to his father's. Oh. Well, did you want to do lunch? Where? At La Casa Tucker. I should be painting, and do you really have a job? Come on, best food in the state. All right, I can spare an hour or so. Excellent. I got a good deal. Uh huh. What's your pleasure? Chinese, Italian, you name it. Is your maid gonna cook it? I don't have a maid. Hey Tiggs, we have a guest. Do you have a bathroom? I need to pull my foot out of my mouth. It's okay. Tiggs is no ordinary cat. So what would you like to see on the menu? Surprise me. Go check for broken windows. Dispatch, this is Bureau 15. Go Bureau 15. I need information on a 322 that occurred in Queen Anne's County two nights ago, over. Copy. Well, I must say, I'm surprised. Why? You don't strike me as the kind of guy who can cook. Ouch. Do I strike you as the kind who can wash dishes? Maybe with a dishwasher. Make yourself at home while I clean up. You said you should be painting. What are you working on? Wait, let me guess. A clown? Ha ha. I've got a commission piece to do. Has to be done in, well, two days now. Not much time for a painting. The money's supposed to make up for it. Can I ask what your going rate is? For this one, I'm getting 20 thousand. See, I told you that painting I bought from you was a steal. We'll see. I'm not sure I can do what he's asking. What's he asking? He wants a picture of his father. Doesn't sound that tough. His father was a clown and he wants him to look a certain way. Yeah I meant to ask you. Lynn Blodgett here? Yeah. What is it, Detective? Could you come with me please? What's going on? I need to speak with Miss Blodgett. Let's go to your house. What's going on? It's okay. I take it this is important? Very. Thanks for lunch. My pleasure. Give me a call later, huh? I will. Can you tell me what's going on? Not here. Nicholas, my son, nothing's... It's not about your son. Please just get in the car. Well? Amanda Greene was murdered last night. What? I'm sorry. I know she worked for you. She was my friend. There's more. What? I think the person who killed your friend is the same person that slaughtered that family three doors down from you. What? I don't think it's a coincidence. I think someone is zeroing in on you. Amanda fought back against her killer. We recovered tissue and blood from underneath her fingernails. And grease paint. Paint? Grease paint. The kind you'd buy in a Halloween or costume shop. I'm sorry, I don't, I don't know what you're trying to tell me. This is the window that he entered from. I admit that I didn't take you seriously with your clown story the other night. To tell you the truth, I'd thought it was shock. Well, you have my assurance that I'm taking you deadly serious now. Thank you. This what he looked like when you saw him? Yes. His eyes are black like that? Yes. Hmmm. Can I have this? Yeah. Whoever this guy is, we'll get him. But until we do you'll have to watch yourself. I'll have someone out in front of your house at all times. I'll call you if I come up with anything else. What the hell is taking so long? You don't want to take that tone with me. It's just, you were supposed to have done it by now. Clearly, there's been a problem. And what's that? First, the guy she's been hanging out with. I could go around that. Other problem, well, it's a clown. What? There's a clown been following her. A clown? For a shrink, you don't hear so good. Tell me about this clown. Only saw him once. Your wife and her new beau went sightseeing at an abandoned amusement park. The clown followed them. What's he look like? He looks like a clown. Face paint, frizzy thing around the neck. So what's the problem? People are getting killed all around your soon to be ex. The cops are swarming. What are you talking about? A family, couple doors down. Then last night, a girl that works for her. Amanda? Whatever. My source in the department says they got grease paint off the window the perp came in. Like clown makeup. This is gonna take more money. I don't think so. Your choice. I'll just keep what you've given me as a deposit for services rendered. Have a nice life. Wait! How much more? Hmmmm, psychotic clowns, cops galore. Another 10. All right, but that's it. I can't pay you any more. The whole make it look like a mugging thing is out. Get your alibi ready, Doc. They're gonna question you. She's as good as dead. Oh Lynn, I'm so sorry. I'm okay. You sure? When did you find out? About an hour ago. Some detective came by asking questions. Detective Peters? Yes, that was him. I think he's following me. Oh, hey. I didn't give this to the detective. I hope I won't get in any trouble. Amanda sent us all an email last night. It's about Mr. Parrish. His father wasn't just a clown. He was a convicted child molester. One of the children disappeared, but they were never able to prove he had anything to do with it. Oh my God. The second page has some pictures. I have to give this to the police. Amanda sent this to us last night sometime before, I have to give this to the detective. Lynn, if you don't want to paint for him, I understand. Flinner Gallery. Oh, hello Mr. Reid. No, I haven't seen her today. I'll tell her when I see her. Bye bye. What was that all about? Nothing, I just, I don't feel like talking to anyone right now. Has he ever bought anything from the gallery before? Well, I don't think so. Hello. Hey, there you are. I tried to reach you at home and at the gallery. Yeah, I've been running around. So, is everything okay? What did that detective want? Amanda, my assistant, she was murdered last night. What? Someone attacked her in her house. My God. Did they catch whoever did it? No. Is there anything I can do? Do you need anything? No, no. Jesus. Do you want me to come by? Listen, Tuck. I need some time to deal with all of this, alone. Sure, I understand. I'm here for you, okay? Thanks. You watch yourself, huh? Where are you now? I'm in front of the police station. Okay. Well give me a call if you need anything. Anything at all. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Okay, bye. What are you doing, Doug? Shivers the Clown. Doctor? Yes. What are you doing? What you told me to. Getting better. What? No, Amanda had nothing to do with getting better. Amanda? Yes, the girl you killed. This, what you're doing, I thought we'd talked about it. You've got to stop this. You should come back and start therapy with me again. You're not hearing voices again, are you Doug? You're confusing me. Wait. I'll call you. I'll help you. To get better? Yes. Just wait for me. Okay? Yes. Hey you, stop where you are! Whoa, what the hell? Turn around, Hey, it's okay, it's all right. Turn around. Get on your knees! Lean forward to the ground, put your arms out to the side. Palms up, turn your head to the left. Don't move. I didn't do nothin', I was called out here... Yeah sure, Pal. You got ID on you? Yeah, inside the suit. You gotta reach inside the suit in my back pocket. Hey. Nothing personal, Lady. Just delivering a message from your husband. He says goodbye. Lady, you don't know how to use that. Wait just a minute. No! Hey. Listen, I wanted to explain about the magazines. I've been an art fan for years. I first noticed your art in those mags. When I heard about the showing downtown, I thought it would be neat to see some of your paintings up close. I thought you said you saw my picture in the program. I did. That's just not the only place I saw it. I didn't want you to flip out and think I was a stalker, which is probably what you're thinking right about now. Anyway, I'll talk to you about it later. Well. Helluva shot, Miss Blodgett. He's pretty dead. Good. Remorse, I like that. It seems your husband hired that guy to kill you. Why would Bert do that? He's divorcing me. He's taking everything. Well I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that he's probably taken out a sizeable life insurance policy on you. Oh, God. Yeah, we found a tape recorder in Mr. Hitman's car. It seems he taped a few conversations with your husband, conversations where your husband hired him to kill you. No. Plain old greed. I guess getting the guy to dress up like a clown was just his way of being creative. Hell, it's as good a disguise as any. He wasn't the clown that I saw. He probably changed outfits. No, I don't think so. Are you positive? He was wearing makeup. Probably figured a mask was much less work. Easier to take off. Why didn't he kill me that night? Maybe he got scared. Scared off by your friend's phone call. We'll never really know for sure. You just take it easy. We're looking for your husband now. We think he's on the run. We haven't seen any sign of him at his house. Don't you worry about it, we'll get him, we'll get him soon. Whatever you were asking for in this divorce thing, ask for more. You'll get it. If you have any other questions, give me a call. Okay. It's amazing, simply amazing. It's even better than I could have imagined. I can't thank you enough. Please, wrap it up. What was the final price agreed upon? 20 thousand. I'll spread the word about your talent, Miss Blodgett. You have quite a future before you. Thank you. Good day. Thank you. Wow. Home run, Lynn. I can sure put this to, oh my God. What? This check is made out for a hundred thousand. He gave me a hundred grand. Flinner Gallery. Mr. Reid. Hold on a moment. Hello? Pretty good actually. A hundred thousand dollars good. I'll tell you later. Well, convince me. Nice theater. Hey Tuck! I'm about ready. You're gonna be in theater eight. Great, thanks. We're gonna grab some concessions. I can send Bobby to do that. Nah, it's all right. I know where everything is. Help yourself. You're like an expert. If I didn't know better, I'd swear you've done this before. Burger King when I was in high school. It's a lost art. You know, I worked in a theater when I was in high school. Didn't last a month. So what are we seeing? I was thinking some scary horror movie where you'd have to snuggle close to me, but given the past couple of days, I opted for a sappy love movie instead. Good choice. I'm gonna make sure everything's locked up. Okay! Hey! Scared the shit out of me. Did Bobby put you up to this? This ain't cool, Man. You're not supposed to be up here. I'll go get Bobby for you. I think he's getting ready to start it. Good, this is a little past my bedtime. I'm glad you came out. I wasn't sure you would, you know... Yeah, I think a movie might be good, get my mind off for a couple of hours. That's the right attitude. Who's watching Nicholas? Julie. She's been dying to take him for some time now. If this takes much longer, I'm gonna demand my money back. What do you think the hold up is? What's he doing now? I'm gonna have to speak to a manager if you don't start the movie, Jeff! You are gonna pay. Move down. Run! No, they're locked! Knock on it. Too loud. ♪ The clowns will move in on your perfect sky ♪ ♪ The villains emerge from the wounds ♪ ♪ Crossing bells rolling the perfect lie ♪ Thrill me! Vic, it's Peters. Yeah, I'm up late. Look, we got a problem. That blood sample from the girl's fingertips came back a match to a DOJ sex offender by the name of Doug Richardson. Yeah, not Heston. Oh and get this, He's got Leber's congenital amaurosis and no I didn't make that up. It's a rare disease, normally causes blindness, but in some cases it causes the sclera of the eye to turn completely black. And to top it off, this guy's a psych case out of Roundsville. You'll never guess who his doctor was. That's right. I think he had two people trying to kill her. Send some uniforms over to her house, have them wake her up and secure it. And call me when that's done, all right? Right. We gotta get this other guy. He's coming! He's here. Jeff! He may be on the second level. Call the police. I'll go find him. Bureau 15. Peters. She's not at the house. It's empty. Any sign of a break in? Nope, however, dispatch just got a 911 from a woman who says she's being chased by a killer clown. At the Columbia Golden Arts theater. They have units on the way? Yeah. Tell the Supervising Sergeant I'm 10 minutes away. Did you get through? Yeah, I'm gonna leave the phone off the hook. They said they'd be here any second. Good, Jeff isn't up there. Come on, let's see if the back door's open. Wait here. What? He's been here. Is it open? What are you doing? Looking for keys. Nothing? Detective Peters, Homicide. Where's your Sarge? Hasn't shown up yet. All the doors are locked, we got guys on perimeter around the building. Why haven't you gone in yet? There's a woman trapped in there with, well, a murderer. Can't go in. Why not? I've called in the Tac Team. This guy's not taking hostages. Tell them we're still trapped in the projection room. Hello? Hello? Hello? The line's dead. You have your cell phone? I left it in my car. You? I didn't want anyone to get in touch with me tonight. Okay, no problem. We can wait it out here. The cops will be here any minute. We'll just wait. Oh shit. He can reach the projection windows from the smaller theaters. Can he get through? I don't know. Oh shit. I'll distract him. You get Nicky out of there. No. He'll kill you. Hey, I'm not gonna let anything happen to either of you. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm going out there but I need you to do something for me. You're what? I'm tired. I'm tired of being scared. And I won't let him hurt my son. Now listen to me. All right. I'm here. Now let him go. Nicholas. I want you to go wait outside for me, okay? Go on. Wait! Why are you doing this? To get better. Why me? Kill her, I'll be cured. Look! Hey. Drop it or you're dead! Don't! That's the biggest fucking clown I've ever seen. How you holding up? We're okay. How about Julie? She's dead. I'm sorry. The paramedics have to take Nicholas to the hospital for a while. Just to do a few tests. You can ride in the ambulance if you want. Hello? Lynn? Thank God you answered. I don't want you to panic. What, what's happened? Look, I've got men on the way, they'll be there any second. What is it? Doug Richardson, the clown, he escaped from prison. I'm sure he's headed out of state as fast as he can go, but I'm sending men over there just to be safe. When? We're not sure, we think about an hour ago. He injured two guards and took a car. He's probably a state away by now.
