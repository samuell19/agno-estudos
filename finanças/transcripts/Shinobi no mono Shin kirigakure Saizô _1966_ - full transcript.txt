Permission to report, sir! The fort of the Sanada clan has been burned to the ground! I see. Tell my whole army to be alert until they find Yukimura's body! Yes, sir! Hidetada! I bet my 74 years of life on the war! Do you understand? The day I trample the Toyotomi clan under my foot, I will leave the entire country safely in your hands. Father! Lady Sen! You made it! That is great! I escaped safely from the castle because of Yayoi's help. I see! Lady Yayoi, thank you so much! Sen, was sending you here Lady Yodo's suggestion? Yes. Grandfather, would you please spare Hideyori-dono's life? I beg you from the bottom of my heart! No, I can't! Attack the castle until it is burned to the ground! IEYASU'S AMBITION HAS COME TRUE AND HE RULES THE ENTIRE LAND, WITH HIS SON HIDETADA AS SHOGUN RESIDING IN EDO. HOWEVER, IT IS IEYASU WHO TRULY RULES FROM HIS CASTLE AT SUNPU. I have terminated several clans, and warned a number of others. Now, if any of the daimyo want to go against the Tokugawa, they become like toothless tigers. If they even try to revolt against our government, they will be quickly punished by the Code of the Samurai, they will have to perform seppuku, and their clans will be terminated. They have no choice but to stay as calm as cats. That is fine for the daimyo. As for the court nobles, they have to follow the martial law set down for nobles. All they can do today is play along. Tokugawa's enemies are not only nobles and Tozama lords. Are you talking about ninja from the Sanada clan? The ninja are vengeful, and have no fear of authority. Like snakes, even if they're cut up into small pieces, they never give up fighting with their enemies. You sound really worried about the ninja. Perhaps you feel weak because of your illness. You don't know how evil ninja are. How evil..? You are the one on top of the world, sir! Even if they are evil, no more than 20 or 30 ninja are left. I don't think they are a problem. Besides, we're hunting down ninja on a daily basis, and 2 or 3 ninja are caught and executed every time. In a short time we will have exterminated them all. No, I don't think so. Those ninja we caught were lacking in skill. The stronger ones elude our traps and still plan to kill me. By the way, what about Fuma Daijuro? He will be arriving with his own ninja forces soon. Only the Fuma ninja are capable of fighting Iga ninja. People say: "Use poison in order to prevent poison." That's the way it is! It's Kirigakure! It's 'Mist' Saizo! 'Mist.' 'Crow' Sagenta! As I thought, it was you. Even if a ninja is born and dies in darkness, I could not stand watching them being crucified in public. I understand. Thank you so much. I tried so often, but Yatoji stopped me every time. Yatoji? You mean Otowa Yatoji? Nabari Onimaru, Akame Goroku, and Suzuka Jinnai, too. We all swore to kill Ieyasu even if we became skeletons. Our only wish is to hold Ieyasu's head in our hands. We must put all of our energy into this mission. Sometimes, we have to make sacrifices in order to carry out our mission. Since the Summer Campaign of Osaka, more than 20 Iga ninja have been executed in Sunpu. We can feel the angry blood they shed at the crucifixion site running through our veins screaming "Kill Ieyasu!" Blood was spilled again today. That was Mansuke! Akane, this is Kirigakure Saizo! Yes. I have heard the name from my grandfather. Saizo, this is old Shimotsuge Yohachi's granddaughter, Akane. Old Yohachi's grandchild..? Akane, what did you hear over there? The Fuma have left Ejiri with a force of 30 men. They're coming. The Fuma? Is Fuma Daijuro coming here? Yes. Ieyasu has hired Fuma Daijuro and his warriors for protection! This is a great opportunity to fight our sworn enemy, the Fuma! Right, we can let them know how powerful we are! That's right! I've been told that you Fuma have never before left Mt. Hakone. That is correct. Until today, we have never left our territory. Then, have you ever fought the Iga ninja? I have not. If we did, there would be no Iga ninja left in existence today. Well, are you sure about that? The Fuma ninja's 'Circle of Flames' and 'Storm of Spears.' Those are the Fuma's deadly offensive techniques. Well, you can defeat the Iga ninja, can't you? Of course. That is why I came down from Mt. Hakone. - Honda! - Sir. Where will the Fuma stay? Sir. I have prepared lodging at the Choraku-ji Temple. No thank you. The wide open sky is our ceiling, and the rocks are our pillows. Everyone! We, the Fuma, are descendents of forces that served Takeda Shingen! The day has come for which we've waited over 280 years! Are you aware, the Fuma has the blood of the Genji clan, and Iga has the blood of the Heike clan! Thus, Iga is the Fuma's mortal enemy! Accepting Ieyasu's request was a good excuse. Now, let's soak our spears in their blood! Are you ready?! = Yes! I hate you! What are you doing? I'm not lying to you. Since the Fuma have come to work for our lord, we have to stay inside the castle. Maybe with so many beautiful court women inside the castle... you've grown tired of me. That's absurd! Of course, there are a lot of beautiful court women, but they are in the inner halls of the castle called the O'oku. We are not allowed there. The O'oku? Is it the place behind that beautiful garden you mentioned? Yes. Is Ieyasu-sama there? I don't know. I have never in my life seen Lord Ieyasu. Let's not talk about the castle anymore. Sagenta-sama. Sagenta and Onimaru went to see the merchant... who is doing business with the castle, Kuchiri-ya. I couldn't get much information. I'm sorry that I couldn't find out where Ieyasu's bedroom is. Not at all. You had to put forth a lot of effort to get this much information. From now on, Onimaru will have to find out on his own. Maybe, it could be behind the inner garden of the castle. Akane... Why did you become a 'Kunoichi' (Female ninja)? A 'Kunoichi' isn't considered a real ninja. Even a real ninja is considered beneath an ordinary human being. So why did you become one? Before I can even remember, my father died at Sekigahara. And my grandfather was killed at the Winter Campaign of Osaka. Both of them died without leaving behind any remains. They both were slain as Iga ninja. It was my destiny to become a ninja. You have to find your destiny with your own two hands. Have you ever thought about pride or your own happiness as a woman? No, I have not! Grandfather told me that to become a ninja, I'd have to first give up my pride as a woman. So, I did as he said. They're waiting. At least ten men. The head is gone! Damn it! I'm not going to die. Until I tell you to, do not summon Hidetada. - But... - No! There are a lot of spies watching what's going on in Sunpu. Saito! What about the prostitute named Akane? I'm sorry. She is very stubborn. I don't want to hear any more excuses! Go! Where is Fuma Daijuro? I'm here, sir. Did you find the hideout of the Iga ninja? Or not yet? No, not yet... Fool! You should be ashamed of yourself! My lord, please wait a little while. A little while? I'm waiting for 75 years! Are you telling me to wait more? Wait! We've fallen into a trap! What? That was an emergency bell, but nobody came to rescue him. He's a body double. A body double? We've killed three men so far. There are still two more left. What are you doing here this late at night? You've entered Princess Sen's quarters. I chased an Iga ninja into this area. He is Kirigakure Saizo. How rude! Unless you have permission from Lord Ieyasu, men are prohibited in this area! Besides, you're making up this crazy story about Iga ninja! If you leave, it will be all right. Otherwise, I'll inform Princess Sen and you will be harshly punished! Thank you so much! Saizo-sama. I am the niece of Chosokabe Morichika. My uncle died at Osaka Castle, and passed his mission on to me. That's why I escaped with Sen-sama from the burning Osaka Castle. Ieyasu is the lifelong enemy of the Toyotomi and Chosokabe clans! I wanted to take revenge on Ieyasu myself, but as a woman I could not do anything until today! I was so desperate. But it was my fate to meet you tonight. I've been waiting for this day for a very long time. Lord Ieyasu is difficult to kill. There are the Fuma and a lot of body doubles. But I'll really help you kill him. This coming 8th, the anniversary of Hideyori's death. I have to go to Choraku-ji Temple for Princess Sen. At that time, we can talk in more detail. Yayoi? What's the matter? Nothing, my lady! CHORAKU-JI TEMPLE Yes, I'm sure she is Chosokabe Morichika's niece, Yayoi-dono. Yayoi-dono. I'm sorry that we doubted you. But until we finish our mission, ninja policy is to doubt everyone. I understand. That is why I believed it was possible to meet you someday, if I waited patiently at Ieyasu's castle. I have heard that Ieyasu is sick. They're trying to keep it hidden. But since he ate some deep-fried fish a month ago, he became ill. No, it must be my curse! It was exactly one month ago that I put a curse on him. His condition? I don't know very much, but since he is not summoning Hidetada, I don't believe he is so seriously ill. He has not suffered enough yet! He should suffer more, and then we'll cut off his head! Would you please let us know about Ieyasu's condition. Yes. Please watch the tower every morning at 11 o'clock from now on. If you see the reflection of my hand mirror, please wait one hour, and come to Choroku-ji Temple. Yes. So, I have to go now. Are you going home? Yes. I'm afraid they'll discover that I slipped out the back door. Makes sense. Sagenta, Saizo. Please escort Yayoi-dono. Osen, you must hate me. No, not at all. Yes, I know you do. I did not listen to your wish. Instead I ordered my army to destroy the Toyotomi clan. I'm the one who killed your husband. I want to forget about it. No, don't forget about it! A long time ago, I killed my son Nobuyasu, together with Lady Tsukiyama. In order to show my loyalty to Lord Nobunaga, I had no choice but to kill my own child as well as my wife. It was in 1579, when I was 37 years of age. If I had felt human emotions and had not killed them, I would not have the whole country in my hands today. This is the way of the samurai during this Warring States era. Do you understand, Osen? You are the wife of a samurai, and also the granddaughter of the lord of the entire country! You must understand even though you are a woman. Permission to report, sir! Shimazu Iehisa-dono is here to greet you before his official visit to Edo. Tell him that Lord Ieyasu has a slight cold and is resting. Wait! I'll see him. Osen! Bring my clothes. My lord! If I don't see him, I'll fall prey to his plans. Osen! Hurry up! Thank you for coming from such a far off territory. Lord Ieyasu... It's my pleasure to see you well, sir! Yes, thank you. As the saying goes "A devil never dies." I guess I'm going to live for a very long time. That is a great thing for our country! Are you all right, sir? I'm fine, thank you... Now if you'll excuse me... Take a hostage from the Shimazu clan! We must immediately take and hold a hostage from their family in Edo. Tell Hidetada right away. "Meet me in my room later, Akane." Blood! Don't blow it out! They'll be suspicious. Oh, I'm sorry because grandfather used to tell me to do this when someone got hurt. They've left. Thank you. Saizo-sama! You asked me if I'd ever thought about my happiness as a woman! Since then, your words have stuck in my mind! You said you had given up on happiness as a woman. I said that on the outside, but I have a different feeling inside my heart! Saizo-sama, I want to find happiness as a woman! There isn't any happiness for a female ninja like me, is there? Saizo-sama! Please, I'm begging you! Being a ninja means... when I hold a woman in my arms, I feel neither affection nor love. I don't care! I want you to hold me! Saizo-sama! Saizo-sama..! I wonder if Kirigakure being attacked last night was by chance. And how about the incident at the merchant Senya Jochu's house? I believe we have an information leak. Well... How about the time when Onimaru got killed? Wait! Are you saying that there is a 'rat' amongst us? Ridiculous! A 'rat' in here...! That's not right! That's not right! Of course, not among us! But... But what...? Are you saying it has to be Akane? If there is one, then it must be her. What are you saying? Akane is 'Old' Shimotsuge Yohachi's granddaughter! She's the grandchild of Yohachi who promised Iga to kill Ieyasu! A kunoichi is not a real ninja! Saizo! Tell me, what do you think? I agree with you. My trust is not because she is Yohachi's granddaughter. But, rather as a woman... Our front gate is being bombarded! Damn It! It must be Fuma Daijuro! Yatoji-dono! Yatoji-dono! Yatoji! Break the back wall! Hurry up! This wall won't last long! Yatoji-dono! Sagenta! You're right about the female ninja! Yatoji-dono! Hurry up! Get away! Yatoji! Saizo! Good bye! Yatoji-dono! Yatoji! Yatoji! Yatoji! Yatoji! Yatoji! Let's go! We've cleaned them up. I promised myself that I'd take your life with my own spear! Daijuro, hold my life for a while. Stop! Withdraw! He died without leaving anything behind. There's nothing we can remember Yatoji by. That is our way as Iga ninja. What are you doing here? I brought this flower for Yatoji-sama. - You must die! - Why should I? You're a traitor! You must kill yourself! As you're Yohachi's granddaughter, I'll permit you to commit suicide! Saizo-sama, do you doubt me, too? Shut up! Saizo-sama! You said my fate depends on me, so I'll prove my innocence by myself! What? Hidetada will be in Sunpu? Yes. He will be here within three days. Is this information really coming from a good source? Yes, I heard from Princess Sen that Ieyasu secretly called Hidetada. Ieyasu must be seriously ill. He's been trying to hide his condition, but since he called for Hidetada, he must be very ill. We won't let Ieyasu die from illness. We must kill him ourselves, as we Iga ninja have pledged. Have you any news about Fuma Daijuro? I haven't heard anything about him. Ieyasu and the priest Tenkai are the ones who control the Fuma. Thank you so much. I'm looking forward to the day your mission comes true. Thank you. Yayoi, please take care of yourself, too. Jinnai, escort her secretly to the castle. Please don't worry about me. We have to be careful of a traitor who might be around us. A traitor? Who is it? We don't know yet, but we have to be extra cautious. Then, I shall go now. We must hurry because of Ieyasu's condition and the traitor. Yes. Please let me go! Damn! Hey! "There are too many violent acts by Iga ninja in the city lately. "They are creating a public disturbance with their activities. "Therefore, anyone who has heard or seen any Iga ninja "must come forward and inform the government." Oh...! Get him! Don't let him get away! Don't let him get away! We've fallen into the Fuma's trap. There are only three of us now. We must kill Ieyasu, even if we three are the end of our line. But we are terribly injured! You're a coward! I'll do it anyway! Even if I'm killed I'll become a ghost and haunt Ieyasu forever! Having the Fuma do evil things and blaming the Iga ninja in order to make people hate us, is typical of Ieyasu's trickery. How about Yayoi-dono? She may be dead by now. Damn it! If we knew where the Fuma were staying... Are they coming? It's Kirigakure. You're late! Hidetada is coming! Maybe tomorrow! How did you find out? There were a lot of fish and vegetables delivered to the castle. It was enough for 40 to 50 people. I see. It is just as Yayoi told us. So, let's go! - Where? - Let's run to Satta Pass. Satta Pass? For what? To ambush Hidetada. Our mission is to kill Ieyasu. Besides, we must find Yayoi-dono. We can kill Hidetada after that! That's wrong. What? You don't care about Yayoi, do you? We are ninja, to complete our mission, we must cut all ties to families and loved ones! That is the core of the Iga ninja's way! And we are the last of the Iga ninja! I was taught we're not for hire, nor are we to hire anybody else! We should live like a lone wolf in the wild, and I've followed the way of the ninja! But when I met Lord Sanada Yukimura, my thinking changed completely! I promised myself that I would live and die for my lord! So I hate Ieyasu with all my heart, he who took my lord away from me! Then, I became a ball of fire, and filled with hatred, I came to Sunpu. But day by day, it has become clear who my real enemy is. If I killed Ieyasu today, it would not harm the Tokugawa shogunate that rules 64 provinces! Curses and prayers have no effect on the Tokugawa dynasty! So, I'll destroy their foundation, and it will bring on the downfall of the Tokugawa! Hidetada and Fuma Daijuro form a base of the government! They're in a hurry. Wait! That palanquin is empty. What? It's clearly keeping pace with the horses and other samurai. Even when they are at this steep incline, their steps are light, and they're not using their shoulders to bear a heavy weight. Look carefully! The last ten are Fuma men! They're carrying their spears as if they were swords. What about Hidetada? Well, he must be going to Ejiri. Stop! Let me go! Akane did it because she wanted to prove her innocence! Are you just going to watch? We missed out on Hidetada, but we can save Akane. Fuma Daijuro will try to find our secret den from Akane. So, we have to find their hideout before Akane confesses. - Kuroda, follow him! - Yes. Listen, Hidetada. You must understand that the future of my country is up to you. I've spent my 75 years of life to become ruler of the 64 Provinces. Do not forget about this! Yes. Daimyo can't do anything because martial law is strictly enforced. But you must take a hostage from each clan's family, just in case. If they don't give us a hostage, then make a marriage arrangement with them. Fortunately, I have 11 sons and 5 daughters, and more than 30 grandchildren. You must use them as wisely as possible. Honda... Itakura... = Sir! Don't let the world know about my death until you've done all this. = Sir! - Hidetada. - Yes! If anyone disobeys your orders, no matter who it is, even daimyo, you must kill them all! - Do you understand? - Yes! There is no need to worry about daimyo from the far-off provinces. What I'm worried about are those living in the west, such as the Shimazu clan. Priest! My grave will face westward. This is my order! Does it hurt you? The rope is cutting into your red and swollen skin. You're so stubborn! I told you I could make you comfortable. Why don't you give up? You're just the same as a whore! You know you can't win! Hey! The Iga ninja think you're a traitor and hate you! Why do you care about them? I see. You're deeply in love with Kirigakure! Tell me. Where is Kirigakure? Tell me! Kill me! Oh, you've finally opened your mouth. Very well! I'll kill you as you wish. But, you can't die an easy death! You see... My Fuma men are like a pack of wolves who are starving for women. I'll tell them to rape you first, and then to kill you! Hey! Get all my men who want to rape this woman! Yes, sir! Listen! This woman wants to die! Please take good care of her before you kill her! Yayoi-dono! Please let me down. You're a coward! Don't give up! Let me down. Just a little bit more, Sagenta. That was Yayoi-dono! I saw with my own eyes! Don't speak! Sagenta-sama! Akane, please forgive me! Please don't say any more. Kirigakure, you've become the last one of us. Don't talk, Sagenta! Sagenta! Sagenta-sama! Was Yayoi-sama really there? Yayoi-sama? Nobody was there. It was deathly quiet. Well... The city was very quiet, too. There were no officers, either. It's been a long time since I've smelled grilled fish. Those were on sale. This morning's order for the castle was suddenly cancelled. They said they won't be needing any fish delivered for a while. - Suddenly this morning? - Yes. - Ieyasu is dead! - What? The Fuma have also suddenly disappeared! At the same time, the castle has cancelled their fish order! Dead. Ieyasu is dead, I'm certain! When will the funeral be? Well.. After Hidetada-sama has gotten back to Edo, and settled the hostage matter between the shogunate and daimyo. I feel sorry for grandfather. Even though he is dead, he can't leave his castle. From now on, for the next 50 to 100 years, he has to watch the whole country from his grave. How long has Yayoi been working for you, Priest Tenkai? Ever since she came to Sunpu. Well, such a poor woman she is. Because of her obsession with restoring the Chosokabe clan, she has fallen to a sad fate that will cut her young life short. That night when Kirigakure Saizo was hiding in Yayoi's room, she didn't waste her chance to sell herself to the Iga. I thought that was a great talent of hers. However, after our lord's passing, we no longer needed her, so Fuma Daijuro will take care of her. A ninja has entered the castle just now. A ninja? How about Ieyasu? As I guessed, he is dead! Oh, no... Yayoi is a spy for the Tokugawa! Yayoi-sama..? So, your job is finished now. No, now is the most important time. What? Even if Ieyasu is dead, the Tokugawa shogunate will be there. But, how about Hidetada? First of all, I have to kill Fuma Daijuro! Daijuro is a thick wall protecting the Tokugawa! I'll follow him to Mt. Hakone, and kill him and his disciples! - I'll go with you! - No, you can't! You must quit being ninja! Live as a human being! Then you can find the happiness of a woman! My happiness is staying with you! If I'm not allowed to go with you... I'll be waiting for the day you come back. I have neither a day to come back on, nor a place to come back to. After I kill Daijuro, I'll go to Edo. I'll kill Hidetada, then Nobuyasu, Tadateru, and Yoshizawa! Then, Yorinao, and Yorifusa! I, Kirigakure Saizo, will wipe the Tokugawa off the face of the earth! Saizo-sama! Saizo-sama! Saizo-sama! Hey! Saizo is coming! Daijuro, come out! I was waiting for you. To kill you is my destiny. Your destiny and the Fuma will disappear from the world today! 'Storm of Spears!' 'Circle of Flames!' Saizo! Take this! You can't kill me! Please forgive me! I'm a stupid woman who was controlled by Priest Tenkai... Ieyasu, Yatoji... Tenkai, Fuma Daijuro, I... I don't want to die... I don't want to die...! TO EDO THE END Special Thanks to: Ichiban and Batman
