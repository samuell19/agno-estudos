Hello, Mr Bunny. I'll help you look for what's buried in the ground. OK! Thank you, Taro! Let's go! I can't see! Look! What is this? Is that what I'm looking for? Well, let's pull it out and see. One, two... One, two... It's so heavy. Everyone, let's cheer Taro and Mr Bunny on. Ready? One, two... Pull it out! Oh, looks like it's coming out. There it is! Why were you in the ground? I sank because I was too heavy. I'd like to repay you for saving me. Could you please help us look for something then, Paon? A childcare expert made the kids laugh in that bomb shelter. It was only hours ago that I met Itakura Kaede for the first time. I was so angry, I yelled at the sky. All grade school students get to evacuate but it's too risky to separate preschoolers from their parents so they're closing the kindergartens? Their parents are either deployed or working to defend Tokyo. Where are those kids supposed to go? It's done. It's nice to have some flowers finally. Ms Fusayo, thank you. A relative in Chiba gave them to me. The government told them to grow produce, not flowers. It may not be realistic but we must maintain our cultural identity. Ms Kaede! What flowers are these? These are called chrysanthemums. They are beautiful! Please don't touch the vase, OK? They are so pretty. Let's see. Where were we? Oh, that's right. Are we being called war-time daycare now? Did they think changing our name would magically keep the children safe? That's why you snapped and yelled at Mr Wakimoto, right? We're not just looking after the children here. We nurture their sensibility in a cultural environment. When the siren goes off, we all panic. At this rate, everything we've built will be completely ruined! So, you're trying to evacuate the entire daycare centre. Yes. Are these children just a research subject for their report? Is the stuff they boast about just a theory? Well said! Angry Girl of Togoshi Daycare Centre! Angry Girl? Ms Fusayo, please don't say that to her. But it's true! So, what is Mr Wakimoto going to do? I'm not sure. It seems he's just going back and forth. Don't be so mean. Hello. Nice to see you. Am I here just to hear her criticism of me? Please don't say that. So, any progress today? Well, the Ministry of Health and Welfare said following school children, pregnant women would be evacuated next instead of preschoolers. In short, instead of saving one young child they'd rather save two the mother and her unborn baby. I was speechless. What? That's terrible! And, you just came back without contesting it? By the way, who is this young lady? Don't just stand there. Introduce yourself. Hello, I'm Nonomiya Mitsue. She's a distant relative of mine and a childcare provider. I brought her here thinking she could work as a liaison between our daycare centre and Kaede. A liaison? Why would we need one? We would after we evacuate this daycare centre. You mean... Yes, I'll help you. Thank you! Hurry up and evacuate. Go. You too. Organ Are you serious about evacuating these little kids, Ms Kaede? Give me a break! It was a huge mess when my son in grade school left. Are you trying to make us suffer more? Why were grade school children evacuated? Please ask yourself that. There will be an air raid sooner or later. That's just what you think. The last air raid we had was years ago. She's right! How can you be so sure? You sound like you want there to be an air raid. She sure does! Sorry, I'm late! What a lively discussion. That's good to see. Director, I'm against this. I can't accept the idea of separating little children from their parents. You teachers are all single with no children of your own. That's why you could make such a cruel suggestion! My little Haruko follows me around like a shadow at home. She can't handle being away from me. They're too attached to their parents. You don't understand how mothers feel. —That's right. —They wouldn't know. Well... I think we should let the teachers take our kids. As soon as possible. You're a father. That's why you could be so callous. Since my wife died I'm the one looking after my kids. I've changed diapers and made their meals. Do you still think I'm being callous, Ms Tamura? Also, my sister who was living in Nagasaki died in an air raid a while back. She had three children. The oldest was only seven. All of them died. Not one of them survived. Air raids are merciless. I'm sorry for your loss. But Tokyo is not Nagasaki. That's right. Don't underestimate the national defence force. —You're right. —We'll be fine. It's not compulsory. But this is about your children. What if an air raid happens? Please ask yourself that. You're just being cowardly. I'm against it. —This is a waste of time. —Let's go. Please. Let's talk this out. There's no point in this. Let's go. Please wait. —Hurry up. —I'll evacuate my children. You think they'd be sad and lonely. But isn't it selfish not to send them away? Of course they're going to cry. Even if they're away from me and crying at least they'll be alive. These teachers may be young and naive but they're good at what they do. Yeah. I trust you. Please evacuate my kids. —Please. —Please. Please. We will make it happen once we made the decision. Right, Director? Yes. I'll make the arrangements immediately. Be ready for sleepless nights ahead. Yes, sir... —Please. —Please. Please. We started getting ready for our evacuation. Good. Here you go. Thanks. Look at your face, Mitsue! —What? —Your face! —Where? —You look funny! See you tomorrow. We had financial support from the welfare organisation for mothers and children but a huge problem loomed before us. Where should we bring the children? We needed to find an empty building away from big cities in a place where the locals are willing to share their food with us. Does such an ideal place exist? Doubt started creeping into our hearts. The teacher in school for swallows Swung her whip I found one! Togoshi Daycare Centre I finally found one! The early childhood education researcher Wakimoto Shigeru, kept his word! What are you so excited about? You don't get it, do you? I've finally found it. An evacuation site? Yes! Where is it? It's in Hirano village in Minami-Saitama. Our daycare will be in a nice temple called Myoraku Temple! That's great! Several days later we went to check out Myoraku Temple where our daycare service would be relocated. Please wait for me! Mitsue, hang in there. This temple is really old and rundown. It's a nice temple! Let's go! Just bats. No need to get startled. My socks are all black. Can we get this place ready in one day? Just the five of us? We have to do it, by hook or by crook! —Let me try it. —Thanks. Ouch! That hurts! —What? —You're hitting me with that. Stop talking or we'll never be done! Focus! —Yes. —Yes. Hatsue, what's this? I'm not sure. I can't do this anymore. A nice temple? Who would live in this dump? I should never have trusted that wimp! Great! There she is! Angry Girl! The dazzling fireworks Blanketing the sky Like a willow tree spreading outwards With a loud bang sending countless red stars across the sky Now they turn blue Now they turn gold The fireworks... Ladies, are you OK? Hey, girls! Mitsue. Nice to meet you. We came from Togoshi Daycare Centre in Tokyo. I'm Itakura Kaede, the senior daycare provider. Thanks for having us. Anyway, please have some tea. You must be exhausted. Thank you. Are you really going to live in this dump? It's not that bad. Right, girls? May I ask you a question? —Shoot. —The shutters are all old and broken. Where are the paper screens and glass windows? There aren't any. What? There never was. Didn't your director tell you? This is so much fun! Pour me more sake, sweetheart. Here you go. It's your turn, Mitsue! We need glass windows. I know that. That wimp is late again. This way, please. Hello, everyone. Sorry for being late. Thank you for being here tonight. You wasted my sake! I'm so sorry. We had high hopes about meeting the educators from Tokyo. I thought you were respected female educators. But what is this? You're just a bunch of young kids who don't even know how to pour sake or greet people properly. I apologise on behalf of my untrained staff members. However, would you please focus more on the young children, and not us? Exactly! We will try not to cause you any trouble... Your being here bothers us. We work very hard to grow our food. Why do we have to share our food with you? You folks are not contributing anything. You're just taking, and not giving! Exactly! Yes, we're taking. That's true. However, the children that we'll be evacuating from the air raids are... respectfully... the Emperor's children. So, you shouldn't accuse them of "just taking and not giving". We must protect them until they become our soldiers. That's our responsibility... isn't it? Exactly! Mr Sawaguchi is right. Of course! We've already agreed to take them in. If we change our minds after enjoying this feast doesn't it make us an unappreciative bunch? Right, Mayor? Did they really pay for all this? Mr Sawaguchi, you had some drinks, right? I didn't really want to. I had no choice. Really? That's your third bottle. —That's right! —You had that much? Yes, this is his fourth bottle, to be exact. —Exactly! —Shut up! This is my third... —I'm sorry. —What are you doing, Mitsue? What are you doing? I drew with my teacher today. Dear. We should let Kenichiro evacuate. What? Are you sure? I'll miss him, of course. I'll worry and I'll feel bad for sending him away. But... I'm his mother. I have to stay strong. Momoko is too young to leave our side. But Kenichiro is a big boy now. I'm sure he'll be fine. He'll be OK by himself. Kenichiro, do you have good friends there? Ya-chan, Tatsu-kun, A-kun... Wow, that's a lot! Who is your favourite teacher? Ms Mitsue. Is that right? The sirens have gone off! The sirens have gone off! The sirens have gone off! Ms Kaede, are you going to be... Hold on. Makoto. —Let's hurry. —Air raid alert! Let's go! Air raid alert! We're fine. On 24th November an air raid by B-29 bombers struck Tokyo for the first time. About 200 were killed. If you haven't registered, please do so here. By a curious coincidence we were leaving Tokyo the next day. Get along with your friends, OK? Ms Fusayo, please look after Kenichiro. Discipline him if he doesn't listen to you. We trust you 100%. —There really was an air raid. —Yes. Right, Hide? Yeah, we have no time to waste. Ms Fusayo, please look after our children. —Kenichiro, let's go say hi. —Excuse me. I thought I was ready for this but it's a bigger responsibility than I had thought. Can I really do this? You're a lot more experienced. You should be at the evacuation site instead. Let's not talk about that. Someone has to stay here. We can't all be evacuated. More importantly, this was your idea. Don't forget that. Everyone. We have to start walking to the train station. Sir. Sir, please take Makoto too. I changed my mind after yesterday's air raid. It was terrifying. You were right. Please. Please take Makoto too. Please! Please! Kiku, I'm glad you changed your mind. Sir, please take him. Please. Please! Let's go. Stay with us, OK? In the meantime, the first group to arrive was busy unpacking our belongings at Myoraku Temple. —Yoshiko, watch your feet. —OK. —Mitsue, that goes over there. —What? Here you go. One, two, three! Okegawa Station Chuff-chuff choo-choo... Ren-kun, Yui-chan, Ta-chan, Ken-chan. Is everybody here? —Ms Kaede. —Yes? Haru-chan is not here. Where is Haruka? She was with us in the train station, right? I'll go check in the train station. Thank you. Yoshiko. Thanks. It looks more like a daycare centre now with an organ here. Are you going to play it? I'll play army songs for you. Just between you and me I don't like those songs. I adored the girl's sad tears I wish the breeze could transport My feelings for her It's Fujiyama Ichiro's song. Who is the scary-looking man? He went to the war, but he got injured. That's Shinji. Oh, dear. That's unfortunate. Yes. He's actually my son. Oh, my! He's your son? Let's hold hands and walk in the field Haru-chan, are you OK? Boys and girls, stay together! Children, don't crouch down. Stand up. We can't. We're almost there. Hang in there. No! Children! Sakiko! Ms Kaede. Let's take a break. Thank god! —I'm hungry. —I'm starving. Aren't we all hungry? It's not cleaned up at all. You got here early. Why haven't you been cleaning up? We spent nights packing everything. It took us forever just to unload it all. Please wait. Don't go in. Welcome! —Wait up! —Go! We'll have to spend all day tidying up the place. Let's set up a place to eat and sleep for now. Yoshiko, help Tomiko set up the kitchen. The rest of us will unpack these boxes. Mitsue! Yes? Play with the kids in the yard until we finish unpacking. How? Aren't you a daycare provider? Figure something out. You can play tag, hide-and-seek sing or dance with them. Just keep them entertained. You just have to play with them. I think you'll be better at that than at cleaning. OK. One, two... Let's go! Monkeys are carrying a palanquin Narrow mountain paths... With Odawara paper lanterns... Let's go! One, two... Chirp, chirp... Louder! The teacher in school for swallows swung her whip and chirped The kitchen... —Kitchen? —The kitchen. Please come with me. You're so frail! Can this furnace still be used? A long, long time ago Near the beech tree forest There was a small mountain The bare mountain was always laughed at Get up, cedar trees! The sun said to them with a smile Put the fire out. I'm done. Ms Mitsue, what do we sing next? What's next? I don't care anymore. The sun goes down... —What is this song? —I don't know. —I need to pee! —Me too! Me too... OK, do you want to go to the largest toilet ever? Let's go! Follow me. Are you all with me? This way... I need to pee! Togoshi Daycare Centre What a nice sign! It sure is. We've never done this before. We made it through our first day. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you. I have a suggestion. As we did in Tokyo we should have meetings periodically. To exchange honest opinions. What do you think? I'm so glad you brought that up. That is what makes our daycare unique. —That's right! —I know! Yoshiko, you'll take minutes. —Sure. —Please. Let me start. We only have shutters in the main hall so I've asked Kondo to get us glass windows. —Me. —Masako. We only have one toilet for all the kids. It's so dirty and smelly. They won't be able to go comfortably. I feel dizzy just thinking about tomorrow morning. I know. We did it in the woods today. It was very nice! In the woods? You did? No, not me. I mean the kids relieved themselves in the woods today. They loved it. What if the villagers see them do that? We're not talking about just one or two kids! Calm down. This is a place to exchange our candid opinions. We'll have to take them to the woods in the case of emergencies. Yes, we only have one dirty and stinky toilet. I'm going to that dirty and stinky place. Shizuko. How about the bath? It'll get colder soon. I wish we could put them in a hot bath at least once every 10 days. I'd like to take a bath every three days. You're asking for too much. Even if someone were to share their bath with us it's probably too small for a group this big. It's impossible for all of us to bathe together. I know. I wish they could build a bath for us. Even so, we'll have to draw well water countless times and boil it. It's a lot of work. We have to be prepared for that. I can't transport well water! We only have two braziers in the large hall. That's worrisome. We may freeze to death before this war ends. Mitsue! I don't care how you feel! What's important now is figuring out the solution to our problems, right? —Ms Kaede! —Yes? I can't write all that down. Please slow down. Use your brain and summarise. You're having a good discussion, aren't you? What's so funny? Come check out the main hall. Let's never forget this lovely sight. What we heard today wasn't the sirens but Mitsue playing the organ and the children singing. We're blessed with good health and decent brains. Let's use them and solve our problems in this facility one by one. We'll create a rich cultural life for the kids. Hello, Aunt Fusayo. How are you? It's already been two weeks since we came to Myoraku Temple. As Ms Kaede said, every day is a battle. A battle? What does she mean? Are they in danger? Calm down. Please continue, Ms Fusayo. We wake up at 6.30am every day. As soon as we get ready, our battle begins. At 7.30am, we get the kids up and put away their futons. Oh, no! What should we do? One futon is soaking wet. Oh, no! Makoto must have wet his bed! Makoto, who wet this bed? Stop lying. Who did this? Hey! Wait, Makoto! It wasn't me, was it? Wait! It wasn't me... Once the kids wash their faces it's time for breakfast. Meals are very simple as we can't ask for a lot. The villagers have been giving us a lot of radish lately. Otomi can make a variety of dishes with them. But a radish is still a radish after all. It doesn't turn into a fish. We have so much stuff to do after breakfast. We do laundry, chop firewood get water, clean and sew. There are little angels who help us out. And there are a few cheeky ones who give us more work to do. Ms Kaede yells at me a lot... Who's this naughty girl? because I'm so clumsy. She's not just the Angry Girl. She's like a gargoyle! Mitsue, finish the laundry first! You have to start all over again. The glass windows that we've been waiting for have been installed just the other day. We won't freeze to death now. However, we still have to take the little kids to the bathroom in the middle of the night. If we don't, we will end up with a bunch of cold and stinky futons the following morning. Anyway, we're working hard to create a cultural life for the kids. Aunt Fusayo, please take care of yourself. Stop it, Ya-chan! P.S. I'm so hungry here. From Nonomiya Mitsue. That's so like Mitsue. Kenichiro hasn't changed. Makoto still wets his bed. Evacuating them was the right thing to do, right? Of course. Here it comes again! It's the end of the year. The families who survived the air raids were able to come visit their kids. Haruka, you're acting like a baby. Mummy! Hey, I want to do this! We can never win against their mothers. She never acts like that with us. Yoshiko, do you want the kids to be clingy like that? I guess so. I'm not sure what I really want. I love these kids and totally adore them. But at the same time... I think they are so much work and so very noisy. I agree. I know how you feel. You're a bad guy. We will punish you! I will punish you! You stabbed me from behind! That's not fair! Yes! Listen to your teachers, OK? You got that? Be nice to your friends. Daddy! Your dad is here. —Yasuko! —Daddy! —Daddy! —Tatsuo! Daddy! —Daddy! —How have you been? —We're super good! —Super good! Super good? If you could let Yasuko and Tatsuo's father stay overnight, why couldn't we let the other crying mothers stay? Haruka's mum was crying her eyes out. That's right. This is different. How is it different? I want a reason why you made an exception for him. Don't you try to brush this off. If I were a child I would be so jealous and unhappy. Mr Okubo... received his draft papers. He's going to the front line? I know the other kids would find it unfair but I decided to make an exception. It's Daddy's smell. Really? You're smelly. You're so mean. They can be mouthy but please look after them. Something else happened that very morning. Don't worry. You just wet your bed. What's wrong, Ken-chan? That's odd. You don't usually wet your bed. It's OK. We'll dry it for you, OK? How about you, Mako-chan? You did too. Good morning. Stop crying, Ken-chan. I'm the one who should be crying. No... no! I hate you! Let it all out. You don't always have to be good and sensible just because you're the older sister. Oh, no! It's raining! —Kids, go in! —It's raining? Hurry up, boys and girls! Get inside! Quickly... Sakiko, are you OK? —Gosh! —Sakiko! Yoshiko! Yoshiko! Shizuko, take care of Sakiko. Sakiko... Sakiko! 10 days have passed since the kids started wetting their beds. It's done. Nice embroidery! You'll help me with mine? Thanks, Yoshiko! I'm good at doing this. And you are really bad at it. Work harder. I will. Can you do a cute embroidery on my clothes too? Are you really going to work harder? Yes. Are you sure about that? I am! Oh, my! Sakiko has... I was so hungry. I couldn't sleep. My mind went blank and I passed out. I cannot take care of these kids anymore. I am very sorry, everyone. From Egawa Sakiko. She ran away... I knew about it. Sakiko had fainted from anaemia several times before coming here. But she really wanted to help with the evacuation of the kids. I really wanted to... support her. I'll try to talk to Sakiko back in Tokyo. Please run this daycare centre with the remaining staff for now. Let's see. Are you facing any issues right now? Our biggest problem is the kids' bed-wetting. Bed-wetting, huh? Do any of you have a good suggestion to fix the problem? Maybe they're too cold. They don't get to take a bath much. Should we at least warm their feet before putting them to bed? OK. Anything else? I've heard giving some salt before bed works. I see. There's a magic spell by a god called... That's silly. That's superstitious and unscientific. Be realistic. How about taking the bed-wetters to the bathroom at night every two hours instead of three? What? How are we going to get any sleep then? —I can't do that. —I can't, either. You're right. I can't do that either. Instead of trying to prevent the bed-wetting why don't we focus on what's causing it? That's quite obvious. They're sad about being away from their parents. They started wetting their beds more after their parents' visit, right? How are we going to solve the problem? You're saying what we all know. We have to do something about it! That's our job, right? Why are you always picking on me? You're probably thinking it'd be better if I left, instead of Sakiko. I hate these meetings! Mitsue! Mako-chan? Oh, no! Mako-chan! Yes! You didn't wet your bed! Good boy... What's the matter? I need to pee. OK, let's go. Hold on, OK? Sleeping with the children goes against our educational policy of promoting their independence. But Mako-chan didn't wet his bed for once because Mitsue was next to him. What do you think, Mitsue? Tell me what you think. Makoto was in great spirits. I'm not sure if it's because I was there when he woke up or because he didn't wet his bed. So... I see. It's well worth trying if this could help them not wet their beds at night. Several days later the motherly-care system started and we allowed the children to treat us like their mothers. The number of bed-wetting incidents decreased greatly much to all of our relief. Hello! Why are you on the cart? It's embarrassing but I hurt myself running an errand for my wife. He'll take over for me for a while. Gosh, I have no idea what you're trying to say. Shinji, right? You have a good memory. Hey, he lost one of his eyes and wasn't doing much anyway. Just consider him one of your kids. Albeit one that's a little bigger. Ouch! Are you OK? Did you hurt your back? Be careful! Be careful! Don't get hurt. One, two! Mitsue, help me! One, two! One, two! Thank you for letting us take a bath. No problem. Don't catch a cold. Stay warm, OK? —Thank you. —Good night. Good night. Ms Yoshiko? Don't be taken in by foxes. What? Are there foxes around here? No. Stop joking around! Take care. Thank you. Good night. Good night. Good night. Yoshiko. What? What do you think of Shinji? What do you mean? He has been giving you a lot of things. It's not for me. It's for everyone. He likes our kids. He never gives me anything be it sugar, dried persimmons or candy. Because you'd keep them all for yourself. Hey! Hey, you should ask him for more. I bet Shinji will never say no to you. I want some caramel candy. You're so greedy! I am. I'm greedy and hungry. I'm always starving. Sure, I am! Ouch... Ouch... There. It's fixed. Thank you. You're a lifesaver. Let me get that for you. Thank you. Aren't you glad that I was nearby? You're lucky. What would I have done if you weren't around? I think you'd have been crying like a kid. How mean! I wouldn't cry. Really? You'd be like, "It hurts!" Well, I almost cried but... See? Oh, yes... Ms Yoshiko, show me your hand. Why? A reward for not crying. Hey, don't treat me like a kid! You're still a kid. I am not! That's the female teacher. Ta-chan, get in your futon. Hurry. A reward for not crying. You are It! Come get us! It's done. Ouch! Hey! You are dirty! The teacher was flirting with Shinji! Stop that! Hey! Stop right there! I told you. Taking in strangers would only bring us trouble. I have been careless in letting Shinji work with them. Isn't Shinji the victim here? He was hurt in the war and now this young girl from the big city has seduced him. Anyone would be tempted... Seduced? Yoshiko would never! You be quiet! We are terribly sorry! You fool. You've failed in training your staff. That's why we're in this mess. Stop talking back and apologise! We are terribly sorry! All you do is apologise. All you do is take! Calm down. We can't kick them out now. You're too nice, Mayor! Many of the farmers refuse to provide them with any more food. —Right? —Sure. Why does Yoshiko have to go back to Tokyo? If she goes back it's as good as admitting the rumour was true. Where is our Angry Girl? Ms Kaede? I'm frustrated too. I wanted to refute them. But our kids won't be able to survive if the villagers give up on them. They have nowhere else to go! I had to stay quiet. It's just for a little while. OK, Yoshiko? We have to keep the villagers happy. Please come back when this blows over. There are people who really need you here. She is talking about me! I will miss you so much. Cut it out. She was talking about the kids that Yoshiko was taking care of. What? I'm sorry for causing you trouble. I promise... I will come back. It's a promise? We took this path before Sure, we did Acacias are blooming Yoshiko. What is it? Was the rumour true? It's just a rumour. But you do like Shinji a little bit, right? Not at all. Who are you looking for then? You keep looking around. I'm not looking around. You're just imagining things. I know you cried in bed last night. That's because I was worried about you. I know. I'm worried about myself too. Oh, my! It's a caramel candy! I cut this with a knife to share it with you. A farewell gift for us. May I have it, really? But Shinji gave it to you, right? I should get going. Take good care of my kids, OK? Ms Fusayo, I found a pine cone! Wow! Is it for me? —Yes. —Thank you. You must be shocked to see what's going on here. Many places have been burnt down. Are your family and friends doing well? My parents' house was burnt down. My family moved to Toyama. Where are you staying now? I'm staying with my uncle in Kanda. I'm just staying there until I can go back to the evacuation site. I don't like staying with my uncle. Why not? He wants me to quit my job and marry someone. Then, come live with us. It's just me and my mum. Is that OK? Are you sure? Of course. Please tell me about Mitsue. This letter is from Mitsue. May I? Aunt Fusayo, how are you doing? I've been so depressed since Yoshiko left. The kids find me no matter where I hide. Please don't come here... Where is Ms Mitsue? I found you! You found me. —No sleeping... —Ouch. But I'm so sleepy... Ms Mitsue... We found Ms Mitsue! Yeah! Where is Ms Mitsue? Where is she? Ms Masako, where is Ms Mitsue? Where did she go? I found Ms Mitsue! Sorry! Mitsue! Sorry! She is too much! She acts like one of the kids. That's what I like about Mitsue! Kids don't laugh or do things according to our plans. To be honest I want to become a daycare provider just like Mitsue. Oh, my. Wait, Ms Mitsue! Ya-chan, you're too fast! Hold up! Ms Mitsue! No! Stop, guys! You can't beat me. Wait! Stop! I give up! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Are you giving up...? —Ms Mitsue? —Ms Mitsue? Ms Mitsue? Everyone, hide Ms Mitsue! This is my private space! It feels so good. OK, let's try to remember one more time. What happened to Ms Mitsue? She went away. Where? I don't know. She just disappeared. You don't remember? OK. Did you find out anything? Did she run off like Sakiko? Mitsue's been working hard since Yoshiko left. Oh, my! I'll look for her one more time. Shizuko, please get their dinner ready. —Please. —All right. Children, let's eat, OK? Stop crying, OK? Mr Kondo! Sorry for causing you trouble. Did you see her? We went to the train station but nobody has seen her there. I asked around the village. They will let me know if they see her. I hope she wasn't kidnapped or anything. Have there been kidnappings in the area? No! No, it doesn't happen here. But... But what? There was a kidnapping in the village next to us. No, I think it was a little farther away. Oh, my god! Don't worry. We will find her. Don't worry, OK? Right. Nobody would want to kidnap Mitsue. —That's true. —Right. Hey, look! Mitsue! What happened to you? Were you attacked? What did he look like? Well... What happened? Calm down and tell me. Well... I was playing in the woods with the kids. The sound of the falling leaves was so pleasant. I had such a good nap after so many sleepless nights... Do you have any idea how worried we were? You were taking a nap? How could you? Kids love you not because you're capable but because you're like one of them! You're... You're an idiot! An idiot? Are you done? Eat more. Smoke is medicine for crybabies. A bonfire is a miracle drug for heartbreaks. That's what my grandma used to say. Otomi. She called me an idiot. I'm just a kitchen worker. I don't know much about the education that Ms Kaede talks about. But what I do know is that there's always laughter around you. The kids are lonely and hungry. But you make them laugh and for a while, they forget their woes. Isn't that what a childcare provider does? You're needed here. It's not like that, Otomi. I'm nowhere as good as you make me out to be. At the end of February, we received notice that Yoshiko was coming back. Yoshiko is coming back! Hatsue? Hatsue! Hatsue! What brings you here? Will you be working at our evacuation site? Yes! Is Yoshiko with you? What's wrong, Hatsue? Mitsue... Yoshiko was... Yoshiko. You were an amazing childcare provider. We'll never forget you, Yoshiko. You always complimented the food I cooked. The air raids in Tokyo were a lot more damaging than they were reported in the newspapers and on the radio. Yoshiko went to visit her uncle in Kanda and was caught in an air raid. She was crushed under his house and passed away. Mitsue? Mitsue... Let's light the lanterns Let's offer some peach flowers The five court musicians play their flutes and drums What a fun Girls' Day this is Bride and groom sitting next to each other... Mummy! I can't keep your bankbook and personal stamp! Ms Kaede, please hear me out. I know this is inauspicious and I shouldn't be talking about this. But who knows if we'd live to come back here ever again? So, if something were to happen to us we want you to raise Kenichiro since you know him the best. Ms Kaede, please do that for us. There's no one else we can trust. Please! Please raise your head. You might not live to come back again? If something were to happen? Please don't say that! You've seen how Ken-chan is here. Of course, he's laughing and singing. So, please... No. That's all the more reason the two of you have to stay strong for Ken-chan. Ken-chan belongs by your side. But... do you really think we'll get to live life like a normal family again? Of course! I'm sure of it. Be good, OK? We'll be back soon. You're a good boy, right? I'm not a good boy! I want to go home with you. I'm going home with you. I want to stay with you, Mummy... You fool! I didn't raise you to disobey us! Let's go. Kenichiro! Ken-chan! Mummy... Ken-chan... Hello. —Are you going out? —Yes. Several days later Kaede went to Tokyo to run some errands. Hey, stop it! Behave yourselves! No... no! If you mess up the futons where are you going to sleep? It's boring without Ms Mitsue. It's boring... On the 10th of March three days after Kaede left for Tokyo for about two and a half hours starting from 12 midnight Tokyo's busiest area was struck by a major bombing raid. Grandpa. Be careful. What are you doing? You have to get out of here! Don't worry about your stuff, Katsuo! We're fine. We have a shelter. —You should go! —This won't protect you! Don't underestimate handiwork! My shelter is a lot better than everyone else's! —Dear! —I'll be right over! Katsuo, stay safe! I will! Kenichiro's photos and our bankbook! Our bankbook! Kenichiro's... Welcome back. So many of the parents passed away. Are we really doing the right thing for these kids? If we're all going to die in the war I'm sure they'd want to die with their children in their arms. Aiiku Settlement House was in Honjo so it was struck hard by the air raid. Fortunately, Ms Fusayo was visiting her relatives in Chiba. About three days after the air raid I finally got to meet with Ms Fusayo. We visited all the kids we could. Smoke was still rising everywhere. I felt the heat through the soles of my shoes. The entire landscape was grey. The only spots of colour were the bright red flames of the buildings... still burning away. Most of the children who didn't come with us died. Some of the children here lost their parents. We'll have to tell the children at some point. I'll leave it to the providers who are in charge of them to do it. Takeshi's parents passed away. Please tell him, Masako. Haru-chan's mother and sister passed away. I'll leave that to you, Shizuko. Ken-chan's parents grandfather and sister passed away. He lost his whole family. Please tell him, Mitsue. Kaede. Mitsue is... OK, I'll tell Ken-chan. There is a lot more I should let you know... but... sorry. Please let me rest today. Excuse me. May I be the one to tell Ken-chan? Please. Mitsue! Open your eyes and look around. Stop it, Hatsue. No. Look outside. Yoshiko lived with me in Tokyo. She could have evacuated to Toyama where her mum was. Do you know why she stayed? Because she promised you that she would be back here. I don't think Yoshiko was a liar. So, I bet Yoshiko is here with us right now. Hey. I need you to do something for me, Mitsue. You lost your best friend. Only you can do this job. —I can't! —I haven't even said what it is. It's about Ken-chan, right? I overheard you speaking. —I can't do that. —Yes, you can! You're the only one who can do it. Yoshiko said... she wanted to become a childcare provider just like you. This is for you. Thanks. I'll take that. Haru-chan, may I have that branch? We took this path before We took this path before We sure did Acacias are blooming Acacias are blooming We sang this song that day We sang this song that day We sure did We will never forget this song We will never forget this song Ms Kaede. I'm so sorry for causing you so much trouble. It's Ms Mitsue! Ms Mitsue... —Ms Mitsue is back. —Yes. Can you play with us? One, two, three! Good job! Yours went so far! One more time. Are you ready? One, two, three! It went even farther this time! Ken-chan is so helpful and smart. Yes! Ken-chan takes great care of his sister, Momo-chan! Yes. Ken-chan doesn't pee in his bed anymore! Yes. Lovely Ken-chan who evacuated with Ms Mitsue. Yes. Ken-chan is strong and doesn't cry! Yes. Ken-chan... Ken-chan! Ken-chan! Yes, yes, and yes! On 10th March there was a huge air raid in Tokyo. There was a huge air raid. The area where you used to live... was burnt down. The American bombers dropped one fire bomb after another. Your house... and your daycare centre... everything was burnt down. Many people died. Your kind and pretty mum whom you love. Your dad who always had a smile on his face. Your grandpa who made funny jokes and made you laugh. And cute little Momo-chan. They're all gone. You're all alone now. You're all alone now. Otomi, it's ready. Mitsue. I have no other choice. But this is so irresponsible of you! Don't say that. Why are you quitting? That's not fair! You're the one who found us this place! You found this rundown temple and made us live here. Now you're quitting? I don't get it! It wasn't my choice! Why are you always trying to bite my head off? That's my nature. If you don't want to leave why are you quitting? —It came. —Who? Not who. My draft papers. Then, I'll quit too. What do you mean? I can't say no to an order from the country. But you're just being selfish. That's right. I'm being selfish. I always stand up straight and worry if everything is OK. If I'm making the right choice or if anyone is sick. No matter how hard I try I can't provide the kids with the life I want for them. What's worse, I was there when Tokyo was bombed. I'm exhausted. It was your idea. You started this evacuee childcare centre. You have a responsibility towards these kids their parents and your staff members. You're just a little tired. I've reached my limit. You question if you're doing the right thing. Nobody knows right now. I think only the surviving kids will be able to give you an answer after they've grown up. So don't give up just yet. Fight on! You're the Angry Girl! Please keep on fighting, for my sake. Otherwise, I... I... This evacuee daycare centre is my pride. These children are my sons and daughters. The childcare providers and kitchen staff are my sisters. The helpful village residents are my siblings. I'm honoured to have such an amazing family! Everyone, stay strong. Three cheers! Hurrah! —Hurrah! —Hurrah! Ms Kaede is so strong. Even now, her eyes remain dry. Mitsue... Everyone has a different way of dealing with sadness. Mr Hashiguchi, thank you. Most of Japan's large cities were devastated by the air raids. So many bombs were dropped. So many lives were lost. Even so, spring came like nothing happened. Wow, there are so many colours! I want some fish! We tried to get along with the villagers and continued our efforts to provide a cultural life for the kids. That summer, the B-29 bombers started coming to Saitama too. —Get up! —Mako-chan, get up! Wake up, Mako-chan. Yui-chan, get up! Let's get up! Look this way. OK, right away. Let's stand up. No! Put your shoes on. Teru-chan, put your shoes on! Everybody, hurry up! —Let's hurry! —Yes. Let's go! Be quiet! Keep them quiet! We're very sorry. Hatsue. If this village gets struck by an air raid what was our evacuation for? Just futile resistance, maybe? Futile resistance? It'd have been frustrating if we got bombed and died without knowing or doing anything at all. Hatsue... I haven't been yelled at for a while. By Ms Kaede? Isn't that a good thing? But she seems angrier than ever. I haven't told you this. During the air raid of 10th March Ms Kaede... lost her father and younger sister. Even so, after their bodies were cremated she and Ms Fusayo visited all the kids who didn't come with us. I knew Ms Kaede was angry. She's been angry all this time. She's not bothered by us although we're right in front of her. Deep down, she's furious. Mitsue, get up! —Get up, everyone! —Get up! —Get up! —Get up, everyone! Get up! No! Get up! Wake up, everyone! You have to get up! Get up! You have to get up! We have to run! Or we'll all be killed by the bombs! Mummy... Mummy! Help! I don't care anymore. Let's not run anymore. What do you mean? I say, we stop running. It's no use hiding in the shelter! Where do we go then? We have nowhere to go. There's nowhere to go. There's no place safe in this country! The war has been going on for so long. It has been 15 years now! It doesn't matter where we go! The war will always hound us... no matter where we go. Get up! Please get up! We still stand a chance! We still stand a chance! We haven't lost just yet! That night, 82 US bombers dropped 593 tons of bombs. 266 were killed. It happened late at night on the 14th of August. The following day Japan surrendered to the US and the war ended. Myoraku Temple - Togoshi Daycare Centre One, two... We used to chase bunnies on that mountain We used to fish for minnow in that river I still dream of those days even now Oh, how I miss my hometown Goodbye. Goodbye. Ken-chan. Have a good life, OK? Let's go. Thank you. Let's go. Haru-chan, please. OK. Here you go. Thank you. Don't run away! Let's clean up. The kids and the staff left the daycare centre one by one. Thank you for watching him. Please take care. Ken-chan! Take care of yourself! Ms Mitsue! Hey! —Goodbye! —Goodbye! Three months later only Yasuko and Tatsuo were left. Let me try it! Ya-chan! I just cleaned the floor! Wait, that's mine! They sure are having fun. Ms Kaede? Where's Yasuko's father? We don't know. But they're lucky. A relative is willing to take them in. That's great. I hope they're nice folks. I'm sure they are. Ms Mitsue, it got stuck on the tree. Can you get it for us? Sure! She hasn't changed one bit. It's not just Mitsue. People don't change that quickly. I'm always mad. Do you know how old I am? No. I'm so sorry. That's why I'm always angry. And I intend to keep it that way. Oh, my. It looks so empty. Mr Kondo! What are you going to do with that? We'll keep it here until the last child leaves. Wow, you certainly are a fine leader. No, it wasn't my idea. It was Mitsue's. That lass? Ms Kaede! Oh, my god! Come with me! Hurry! See? Daddy! Yasuko. Tatsuo. Daddy! Thank you so much... for everything. Take care! Have a good life! They're all gone now. Now, you can finally... take down the sign for your evacuee childcare centre. Ms Kaede is crying. Ms Kaede is crying. Oh, my! All of you are crying like newborn babies. In the air raid on the 10th of March 1945 100,000 were killed including many pre-schoolers. These childcare providers managed to save 53 children. It's so pretty. Shall we pick one each? Sure. Ms Kaede! Hurry.
