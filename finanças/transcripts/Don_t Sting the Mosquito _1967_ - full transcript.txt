Get it in your head, this isn't just a military school. Our private academy will receive official recognition. Here you will become soldiers and learn the military art. Get ready to sacrifice, to discipline and absolute dedication. Sergeant! Run 50 laps! Side right. Right. Second, third, fourth, fifth, seventh, ninth. Out of the line and go in the Fortress for three days. Learn to run. You, go! Run! Move! Lazy bums! They must become soldiers! Discipline! - Bartolomeo. - What happened, my sisters? - Come. - Here I am. What are these animals for? Sergeant, send them away! Bartolomeo, go to your wife, we are worried. Giovannino, calm down, don't eat too much. Peppino, don't be so greedy. There's food for everyone. Carletto, you don't have any, as usual. Maria Cristina! - Yes, Bartolomeo? - Maria Cristina, what a shame! - Look what your wife is doing. - She is doing it again. What will people think if they see her? You're feeding birds again. I had some bird food, and it is very cold today. I had forbidden you, this is a fortress. It isn't the house of the animals! What do I have to do with you? I have to punish you? Do you want the General or the Marquise to hear about this? Or even the minister? The wife of Commander Santangelo gives food to the beggars, she steals shoes from recruits to give them to those in need. You stole our flag and made underpants for the farmers' kids! Bartolomeo, they didn't have any, it was immoral. When will you live with the dignity that is suitable for my rank? You always have to take care of birds, rabbits and butterflies? You saved dogs and cats, even rats! You are not 13! You forced me to send to boarding school our daughter Rita because I was afraid of the education she could get from you. Maria Cristina, look me in the eyes. Promise me you will not take care of beggars and animals anymore. I swear. Oh, sorry. My hand in your hands. Your eyes are looking into mine. Smile without a reason. Being happy for nothing. I need us to be together, to feel like it's only us in the world. In this big world that I think it's all yours, because I fell in love like that. This great love can't be hidden. Cant be hidden this great love. I swear, my love, that I will defend it and that I will be able to protect it. This great love. The need to stay close, to feel like it's only us in the world. In this great world that I feel it's all ours, I fell in love with you. Our great love can't be hidden. Can't be hidden this great love. I swear, my love, that I will defend it and that I will protect it this great love. - How much do you love me? - Three. - That's all? - 3,000,000 million million. It's amazing, my dear, that we ran away together. It would be better if I spoke to your father to tell him that we are going to get married. If you tell him I won the festival and that we ran away from school, he will send me to a convent and cut you to pieces. - What? - You don't know, he is crazy and he is very old fashion. He is obsessed with the military, he is always in character. He even started a military school that the ministry didn't recognize. - He is a crazy man. - But he must understand... - No. - So what? I can't take you around, I respect you. And I respect you, it's important that we love each other. Let's run away to London, and then we'll see. You don't understand, we can't continue to live like this, like two little kids. Stop it, now is not the time to worry about it. Worry only that I love you, I am wet and I am hungry! Look, they talk about us, the festival, isn't that amazing? What's wrong? Why are you so serious? - Dear, what's wrong? - No, it's... I am worried. Try to understand that I love you, but I am responsible for you. You have to understand, because if you don't understand this, you might end up hating me. Stop it, you know that I love you. Promise me that no matter what happens, - you will still trust me? - Yes. You're scaring me. Excuse me. Ok, thank you. Remember, you promised. - Yes. - Come. - Where? - Come. Where are we going? - Let's go. - What happened? - Your father is here. - My dear, little, Rita. - I brought your daughter back. - Hi, Rita. - What is this hat? - She was a great student. - She graduated with high marks. - Good. The principal asked me to bring her home after her studies. Thank you professor and thank the principal for me. Rita goes home. Professor, I have to go back to school. You make students while I make soldiers. - Goodbye, thank you. - Excuse me. Rita, say goodbye to the professor, I'll get the car. Rita. It's better for you and for us. Let me go, you're a traitor, I don't want to see you ever again! - Popeye! - Welcome back, miss Rita. - How are you? - I am working for the captain. - Sergeant! - "Ja, mein general". The guard has a dove on his head! See? Can you explain me that? It's an insolent dove. Punishment. - Little potato! - Mother! Other pests! Sergeant, you're responsible for any bird presence in the barracks. - Little potato! - Mother! Mother! You scared me when you ran away from school, I know everything. - Maria Cristina! - Dad is coming. Let's meet in the attic tonight. How many times I have to tell you that I don't want birds in the fort. - Little potato has arrived. - Enough of nicknames! Enough of that useless affection, let's go say hi to your aunties. Little potato. Rita, say hi to your aunts. - Hi, aunt Carlotta. - Welcome home. - Aunt Genoveffa. - Good morning. - How are you? - Fine, thank you. Done. Sergeant! At your age you still let people play jokes on you! Miss Rita, how nice to see you again. It's passed a long time since someone woke me up with a sword on my head. These are old friends. Guys, how are you? Come. - Hi. Hi. - Stop, miss! - Stop! - Rita, you grew up! You are a young woman! - Would you like to be our mascot? - Yes! I will never forget my Swiss people! - Do you remember our songs? - Yes. Shall we do it? Let's go! Miss Rita, careful, If the commander will hear you, he will send you all to the fortress. Don't be loud! Come on, guys! One, two! Switzerland. Switzerland. Switzerland. Switzerland. Switzerland. Switzerland. Switzerland. Switzerland. This Switzerland that you come from, this Switzerland, what could it be? This Switzerland that looks like it is such a thing, what it is in the end? What is Switzerland? Don't underestimate Switzerland because... What is Switzerland? Switzerland. And now attention, I will tell you what it is. Ein! Zwei! Ein! Zwei! Three! What is Switzerland? Switzerland is a nation. Ein! Zwei! Ein! Zwei! What is Switzerland? Don't underestimate Switzerland because... Switzerland, what it can be? Switzerland, oh my! Switzerland. And now attention, I will tell you what it is. Ein! Zwei! Ein! Zwei! Three! Switzerland, Switzerland. Switzerland is a nation. - Are they from the Colleoni Academy? - Yes. - Are you a Swiss guard too? - No. Lucky you. Unfortunately, I am. Come have a toast, let's drink another glass. Drink, my friend. Life is worthless. - You are right. Cheers. - Cheers! I must go to prison. I have to go to the Academy, my father is forcing me to become a Swiss guard. There are so many watch factories! My father is forcing me. I don't want to be a Swiss guard! - You are right. - Wolfango is very sad. - Who is Wolfango? - I am Wolfango. I don't understand why with so many pretty girls in this city, Wolfango must stay closed in the barracks. I don't want to be a Swiss guard! Bloody hell! I would pay for not going there. - I would pay to go there. - Why? My girlfriend is there, she is the daughter of the commander. Do you understand? Do they know you? No, tonight I will go there to start my two year training. Would you like to trade places? Yes, but how could we do this? I have an idea, listen... Rita. This noise cheers me up. - No, this noise is really rude. - Rude! It is not nice to eat it in front of us who have a few teeth! Sorry, I didn't think about it. - You never think! - Think about it next time! - Maria Cristina, auntie is right. - No, dad. - What? - Bartolomeo, Rita wanted to say... No, mom. I wanted to say what I said. Aunties aren't right. Accordingly to this reasoning, we all should walk using crutches to not humiliate cripples. Or we should wear glasses not to humiliate those who can't see. - What is she saying? - Rita! She went to boarding school to get a good education! Thank you, I am not hungry anymore! I am sorry, it is my fault. Rita, apologize to your aunties right away. Marsch! I apologize. No, wait. - I am leaving. - I made dessert. Is it the same almond bread? Let's leave, she always makes the same dessert. - Rita! - Dad, mom made it for me. With your behavior... Dad, this is too much. - Bartolomeo, let her taste it. - I said no. It doesn't matter. What is on TV today? Are you crazy? Don't let your aunties hear you. - Why? - Rita is here, let's watch TV. Do you want to exasperate those three women? At night our aunties play for all of us. It is a noble way of spending time, spiritually nourishing the family. Go listen to them. - Yes, Bartolomeo. - Dad, where are you going? I'll go to my office to review some strategy essays. Mom, what do the aunties do at night? - A bowed string trio. - Dad is clever! He does that and runs away! - I will not let him do this to me. - Be patient. That is too much. It isn't a good joke! Careful, don't let them hear you. Two new recruits came, let's see... - Why are you naked? - My uniform is small. Corporal, take care of it! - What is your name? - Raus, from Bern. - What is your name? - Wolfango Von Braghen. - Where do you come from? - Zurich. When you talk with your superior, you must always say "yes, sir"! - Understand? - Yes. - "Yes, sir." - Yes, of course. - Always say "yes, sir"! - Yes, sir. Learn to speak Italian, we are in Italy. Take the recruits to the barracks. Side right! Hurry! Hurry! There is toothpaste on my bed! I can't sleep like that! Poor little boy! Do you want your mom? Hey, are you looking for trouble? You are a fire starter! Tell the new kid that I don't like funny people. Tell him that I will beat him up if he doesn't behave. - You will beat me up? - Yes. What is going on here? Sleep... Sleep! Hi, mom. Rita, finally. It is so nice in here. It is lovely. What are you doing? Are you smoking? - Are you reading Angelique? - Yes, this is my shelter. I brought here all my stuff, my rabbits, my doves. There's even Senofonte. I painted it and fixed it all by myself. Your father doesn't understand such things. - Him and your aunties are... - My aunties are boring. How can you deal with them? Rita, dad... Senofonte! I was saying... - Senofonte! - Senofonte! Your father isn't mean. I know, he has a bad temper, but it is also the fault of your aunties. - Have they always lived with you? - Yes. - So you don't go to the theater ever. - No, never. And I wanted to play, to laugh, to have fun. This is why I started to take care of cats and doves and rabbits. Maybe they are right to think that I am crazy. No, they are crazy. In an age like this, in which people went to the moon, dad and the aunties spend their evening with bowed strings! I will not stay in this tomb, I came to tell you that. I'll get out. - What? - I can't do it anymore. I want to run away tonight. Mom, why are you acting like this? Come on, mom! I waited so long for you to return. They said I wasn't doing a good job and they sent you to boarding school and I had to stay alone with them. They will blame again, but I don't care about that. I've been waiting for you all this time and if you'll go away, it's going to be over. Ok, mom, I'll stay for now. Many things must change around here. I'll take care of that. I'll make you have fun! We'll have lots of laughs! It's very cute here, there are a lot of fun things here, I like it. Since I've been here, for the first time I feel at home. - What's in here? - My treasures. Those are your grandma's gowns, she was a very elegant woman. She went out to dance, to the opera house, to concerts, she travelled. - There are things there too? - Yes, there too. I like them very much, sometimes I wear them. - Really? - Yes. Let's see how it suits you. Beautiful! - I will wear one as well. - Good job! I heard you at the radio and I didn't know it was you. - You are very good. - Thank you. - Did you like me for real? - My little potato! That song is really cute, how does it goes? We have a riff! You are extraordinary, I would die to dance and sing like you. - With the rhythms of today. - Should I teach you? Yes! It's not difficult to do the shake. Come on, try as well. That is the Charleston. I never dance like that. Come on, mom. You can do it. Just let yourself go. You just have to do this. But that is the Can-can. I am old and I can't dance. Come on, mom, try as well. Mom, that is the Tango. No, you're wrong. That is the Samba. This is the Shake. Come on! Try with me, mom. Yes, that is the shake. Yes, I like it! Come on, give yourself into it. - Honey. - What are you doing there? Go. - Open. - No, I don't want to see you again. Rita, open, please. Don't act like a child. It's very cold in here. - Are you very cold? - Yes. And you deserve it! You handed me to the enemy! I will never forgive you. What are you doing there to get cold? It is over, farewell. - No, Rita... - Oh, my! - Did I hurt you? - No. Rita, be good. Honey, I hope that you are there. And that you are not leaving me talk alone like a jerk. Don't do this. I want to hold you so much. Where can we see each other? Let me know soon, before your father sees me here and recognize me. Commander Santangelo wouldn't be happy to find your professor among his students. Answer me. I will pass a paper under the door, it is a song I wrote for you. I hope that you are there to get it or one of your aunties will. Wait. You are there, you cheater! Honey, now I must go. I will wait. I care for you. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. The whole night to think about you. The whole night to dream about you. Run into my dreams as fast as you can. The night is here in front of us. I close my eyes and in the dark I see you smiling and in love, in front of me. You hold my hands as much as you can. One night in front of us. Senseless things I will tell you in my dreams. And in your arms, my love, I will dance. It's a timeless night, If you want. It's a night, my love, just for us. We took a nice stroll, you can gallop good. Yes, I like to gallop, but why do we have to do this at dawn? The commander says that the morning is made of gold. If not everybody is awake by 5 in the morning, he gets upset! Then? My hat! You are not joking! Look! - What is your name? - Skinny Jack. - How much do you weight? - 20 kg. You used to weigh 20 kg, now you weigh 20 kg and 3 ounces! They killed the boss! She must be from Texas, did you see how she shot? - Who are you? - She's the commander's daughter! You are wrong, I am Calamity Jane but my friends call me Gringa. - Why are you playing here? - They don't let us play at home. - Why? - They don't let us play cowboys. Grown ups are all the same, they want us to be bored. Adults are unjust, like the song says. Do you know it? Why do adults criticize everything we want to do? Why? Because two isn't three. Why, either if we are poor or lords, we always have someone above us? Why? Because two isn't three. Why this is forbidden, this is voided, and this is denied? This you must not. This you should not. Why, if mom is upset about something, we end up getting spanked? Why? Because two isn't three. Why do adults criticize everything we want to do? Why? Because two isn't three. Why this is forbidden, this is voided, and that is denied? Don't do this. This you can't do. Why, if mom is upset about something, we end up getting spanked? Why? Because two isn't three. "I'll wait for you tonight at the armor room. Rita." - You are finally here. - You are hurting me! - Stop! - Open it. You are a traitor. You wanted to get rid of me. Open this thing! Do you think I like to pretend to be Wolfango from Zürich? The corporal makes me run holding a halberd. I saw you this morning, you were amazing with those pants on. You make me laugh so much! You were laughing at me! It is what you deserve, you betrayed me and now you pay. Open it, I am suffocating! Don't be so unfair. I don't like this situation. I couldn't take you around like that, what would people think? You are a minor, I can't marry you without your father's consent. What should I do? Come on. I love you. Let's make peace. My aunties! - I heard some noises. - Nonsense! - The ghosts! Help! - Let's run away! - Help! - How scary! They got scared! Take the armor off, I'll go check. Let me take this off. Finally, my love! Did you forgive me? I wanted to hug you so bad. - What is going on? - It is today's training. Don't laugh, look at me in the eyes. Do you still care for me? I was so afraid that you would not want to see me again. Unfortunately, I can't do that. It is useless to try to run away, we are both stuck. You are a traitor, you ruined me. Now that I am with my father I can't sign a contract until I turn 21. But we should still talk to Teddy Reno and the others. - For you, for your songs. - Yes. Let's go to the Carnaby Club, they are always there. - Tonight. - How can we go out? The gate is closed and there are guards patrolling. I know another exit. In the armory there is a trapdoor. A secret passage to go out. Are used it when I was a child. Let's go. You will find too many things against yourself. Excuse me, I will be back. You must suffer. What can you do? That's life. - My friend! - Wolfango! What are you doing here? I ran away with my girlfriend. - The daughter of the commander. - When will you go back? I will not go back, it's your turn now. - Bloody hell! - Why don't you introduce me? - She is Vanessa, my girlfriend. - Hi. I cannot think about going back to that cemetery! I had just started to live again and now I have to die! - Damn! - Look! - The blondie! - Who is he? I'm Wolfango and she is Vanessa, my girlfriend. - Nice to meet you. - What is the mysterious blondie! Let me see her too. Honey, come. Finally you came back, miss, you disappeared. I have your contract ready, all you have to do is sign it. I can't sign it, I am a minor and my father doesn't approve. But you won the festival, that's extraordinary. You'd ruin your career. - I will have to wait. - Young man, tell her too. What can I do? I only write songs. I'll put in a nice word for you as well but help me make sure she'll do at least a couple of TV shows. Be her assistant. - Her assistant? - He isn't my assistant, he is a songwriter and I will sing only his songs. That would be another mistake. You have to sing beautiful songs no matter whose they are. You can't be tied to just one author, more so to an unknown one. I'm sorry, I only sing his songs. I prefer that you don't sing my songs. I don't want to know anything, good evening. Paolo! I'm sorry. Paolo, why are you doing this? You don't understand, I don't want to be your prince consort. I sing your song because I like them. I have a feeling that you only sing them because they're mine. And that they take me just because they want you. We can't make a career together, we have to work alone and be together like two kids that love each other. Otherwise the job will come between us. - Paolo, but I... - Stop talking, go back to him. - Please, don't talk about me again. - Paolo! Shall we dance? You look at her and she looks sweetly at you, and then she hugs you. And you talk to her exactly how you talk to me. With that smile. With your smile. With your smile that I thought was only for me. You are destroying, you are ruining our love, and you don't know it. No, you don't know. Al that world that we were, just us. You can smile at another like you smile at me. Like you smile at me. With that smile. With your smile. With that smile I thought was only for me. You are destroying, you are ruining our love, and you don't know that. No, you don't know it. All that world that we used to be. Just us. You can smile at another, like you smile at me. Like at me. She always comes here when she rides her horse. Here! Come on, get in! Too bad, it doesn't start! Come on! Let off the breaks, idiot! Hurry! Wait! Stop! Rita! Stop! Rita, get down! Rita! Come down from the tree! Don't bother me, I'm not talking to you. I don't like this thing, he's not the one for me. He really does love you. The other girl doesn't mean a thing. He messed up, too bad for him. I don't want to hear about someone like him. He can be with whoever he wants, I don't care. Don't be so mean, you have to forgive him. Please, come with me. This world is filled with girls always ready to play with love, but if you think you can do that with me, you are wrong. Don't be like that. Don't be a baby, come down from there. He really loves you. The other girl doesn't mean a thing. You messed up, too bad for you. Don't bother me, I'm not playing. He can be with whoever he wants, I don't care. Don't be so mean. You have to forgive him. Please, come with me. This world is filled with girls always ready to play with love, but if you think you can do that with me, you are wrong. Look at me. I hate you. I don't care about that girl or anyone else. I have some great news. Look at me. Last night, after you left, Teddy Reno made up for what he did and he offered me a TV show on New Year's Eve. Honey, that's great! It's a benefit show sponsored by Marquise Filangeri at a hotel in Sestriere. There will be rich people from all over Europe. There will be two kings and I don't know how many ministers and the tickets cost millions. It will be broadcasted on TV, it could be my big break. Unfortunately I have to leave in a half an hour. I'm going with Teddy Reno and a bunch of fantastic performers. I'll sing with them. We have barely time to practice. Are you happy? - Someone is coming. - My mother. - Does she know? - Yes. Hi, Rita, I was looking for you. Come on, Pasqualino. Dad wants to speak to you. - This is Paolo. - I am her mother. I wanted to tell you that me and Paolo love each other. - We want to get married. - I am happy. Pasqualino, behave. - What? - Yes, we want to get married. What do you think about it? I don't know. - What about her as a mother-in-law? - I am happy to have met you. Now I have to go. See you soon. If I may... - Goodbye. - Be careful. Do your best. Good luck, goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. We have to run back, dad is looking for you, he is very upset, and he's with a strange woman. - Who was he? - Bye! Come on, Pasqualino! He is nice. I'm glad to see you, Miss Santangelo. Since you ran away I didn't think I'd see you here. - I imagine she's the mother. - Yes, she is my wife. Nice to meet you. Miss, I am surprised that you underestimated my value as a teacher, thinking that I wouldn't come here to talk to your father. I am sure that he appreciated very much my report. Yes, very much. I will show you. You betrayed my trust, you behaved very badly. - But... - Shut up! You showed no respect for my good name. - Shame on you! - Dad, this is too much. Don't sit down and don't answer to me! - Shut up and just be ashamed! - Rita, I beg you. There is nothing to pray about. With such people you just need to be tough! To jail! Commander Santangelo. General Gavazzeni Scotti wants to visit the academy. Whenever he prefers. Tomorrow at 10:30? Very well. I hope that with this visit the Academy will be officially approved. Thank you. The generals will see how I treat my soldiers, harder than iron. To jail! Bread and water! And you will stay in the fortress for a month. We'll see who is more stubborn between you and I. Sergeant! Take my daughter to the prison. You will be responsible for her. - Bartolomeo, I beg you... - Don't worry, mom. I am starting to have fun. I guarantee that it's better to go to jail then to live with my aunties. - Shameless! - Yes, it's fine. I am sorry for your, dad. You made a mistake. - You will regret that. - Rita! - I had forgotten. Miss, thank you. - I did what I had to do. You are not beautiful, but at least you are very unpleasant. - How rude! - Good evening. Rita, you called for me. Prison destroyed you. Guards, she ran away! - I am here, dad. - You are here. Prison destroyed you and you want to apologize for your terrible behavior. I can't even think about it, you dancing on stage. My daughter! I should just disown you. But I hope you can be saved and I must try to do so. Therefore, I'm waiting for your apology. Dad, there is a misunderstanding. I didn't call you to apologize - but to give you an ultimatum. - You? An ultimatum to me? Yes, dad. I am tired. If by tomorrow morning at eight you will not let me out and you don't end this, it will be war! You dare to say this to your father? To Commander Santangelo! I will make you repent your insolence. You will stay here until you have become like a lamb. I have broken tougher backs than yours! The inquisition will look like a game compared to me! I will destroy you and make you rot here. Like Silvio Pellico! - At 8:00, remember! - Shut up! - It's eight o'clock. - Very well. It's 8 o'clock and dad didn't come. The war has started. Run! Hurry! The last five will end up in prison! Hurry! Saddle up! In the square in five minutes! Hurry! Hurry! All men ready. Get the halberd! Get the halberd! Come to the square! Why this hitching? Three doves? Three doves! General, the guards are in the yard! I want to know why the doves are in the armor room. Arrest them, get them, kill them, take them away! At your order! The general's car is arriving. All right, I am coming. What is this itching? It must be the lice from those pests my wife leaves everywhere. Let's hope everything will be fine with General Gavazzeni Scotti. Excuse me. Mr. General, my respects. I am very proud of your visit. I don't understand. What is going on? - Are you crazy? - Stop! Officials! Soldiers! Careful, General! Who is throwing these feathers? Why are you falling? Here we go! "À la guerre comme à la guerre." You wanted this. It is your fault. This place is terrible. It is monstrous! It is unacceptable that you got me into this mess! I didn't know about it! - Criminal! - Take me away! You will not have recognition! You ruined five years of work! I will kill you all with my halberd! Wolfango, is it you? Come, let me see! You are funny! I'm tired and sad, I'm going back to Switzerland! Don't exaggerate, it was a marvelous scene! I can't laugh if you laugh, that means you're not in love. - Why do you say that? - You're unlucky in love. I'm not, maybe you are. Vanessa is with Paolo in the mountains at Sestriere! With Vanessa? Fine, she went to ski. No, it's just an excuse, because Vanessa... Because Vanessa... - Is very beautiful. - Why are you telling me this? I trust Paolo, he told me that he doesn't care about Vanessa. Vanessa said she is in love with Paolo! She said she prefers him over me! When Vanessa wants something, she gets it! - She really said that? - Yes. - You swear? - Yes! - I'm leaving! - Where are you going? - To Sestriere. - Slow! I'll fall! - Sergeant! - Sir, yes sir. Don't laugh, there's nothing to laugh about! Sergeant, bring my criminal of a daughter! Destroyed, ruined, ridiculous in front of the officials! In one hour your daughter ruined 5 years of work that I dedicated to my military school! Careful! I'll send her to prison! She broke the penal code! Do you know that General Gavazzeni Scotti fainted? My school will not be approved but she will end up in prison! Stop laughing! Bartolomeo, what can I do? I feel like laughing. Maria Cristina, are you crazy? Are you reacting to me? - Let her in. - I can't let her in, she's not here. - She's not in her cell? - She escaped. - She escaped? - My general, in her cell I found this letter. - It's for her mother. - Here! "Dear mommy mom..." - Good Lord! - "You know that until now" "I resisted running away from this ridiculous tomb..." What is this? "Only for you. But this time try to understand me" "I have to go." "I'm at Sestriere, I will send you news from me." - "I love you, Rita." - That's too much! She needs jail! "Post scriptum." "I don't care what aunties think" "because they are three old fa..." She fainted! "Farts." "If you can, try to make that beast of dad understand." "Bye, mom, kisses." She fainted. These are the results of your education. Look what your daughter has become. What has she become? She is shameless! An anarchist! No, dear Bartolomeo, Rita is a wonderful girl, good and intelligent. She's young and is right. You will not make her end up like me, tired and suffocated by those three hags. - What are you saying? You are crazy! - It's your fault, Bartolomeo. Maria Cristina, how dare you? Yes, I dare. I should have done it when I understood that I married an annoying, ridiculous, egotistical man! Ridiculous? Annoying? Egotistical? Mean? Maria Cristina... Sergeant, you shouldn't listen to private family matters! Some discretion, get out! - Maria Cristina... - Have you looked in the mirror? Why? I'm handsome! You don't realize how ridiculous you are. I'm ridiculous? Maria Cristina, you are not well. Maria Cristina, I can't see you like this! Commander sir, don't worry, you'll never see me again! I'm going to see my daughter to do all the things you never let me do! I'm going to have fun, to smoke! I'll cut my hair and go dancing! - Maria Cristina, dancing? - Yes, I know how to dance! - Please! - You want to see? - Maybe she got meningitis. - God help us! Poor woman! Genoveffa, Onorina, Carlotta, did you see that? - Yes! - She was dancing! - Yes, we saw it! - Dancing! Always up to forget that we are down. Always up, to forget that I'm down. To convince myself that this time it ended like that. Always higher up, the sun shines, but, you know, not for me. The white snow, I don't like it any more and it's all your fault. And up on the mountain, even my sadness will pass. Up on the mountain even your sadness will pass. And up on the mountain I will find happiness. Always going up, to forget that I'm down. That's what you wanted. I am happy, believe me, I'm fine without you. And up on the mountain even my sadness will pass. Up on the mountain even your sadness will pass. And up on the mountain I will find happiness. Always going up to forget that I'm down. To forget you. To forget you. To forget. Always going up, to forget that I'm down. To forget you. To forget you. To forget you. - Maestro Paolo Randi? - Of the band? Listen... You are here! I'm looking for Randi, he should be here for the show. - Yes, I called him. - Did you see him? - No. - He left with a girl. They went skiing. - Where are you going? - To look for him. You know how to ski? What a scare! This love of ours can't be hidden. Can't be hidden. Maestro, it's the end! Read it, it arrived just now! Judy, the singer, is delayed in Las Vegas! We're ruined! How can we replace her now? You are the director, do something. I'll call Milan. Easy to say I should do something! What a bad luck! I have a solution! I saw that girl from the festival in Naples! - Rita is here? Where is she? - She's with Teddy Reno. Where are you going? - Good morning. - I'd like a room. - Did you make a reservation? - No. That's a problem. - Miss, good morning. - Paolo! You look good in your ski outfit. - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for a Rita, she's here. Yes, I'm looking for her too. You go get settled in. - Find a room for the lady. - All right, no worries. - I'll tell her that you are here. - Thank you dear. Room 23, take her luggage there. We don't have a good balance. Wouldn't it be better if you went and got a cappuccino? I have to go! How can I with these skis? I'm stuck! - Do you need help? - I'm looking for someone, - but I don't know how to ski! - Come with me, get on my back! - On your back? - Hey, you are leaving me here? - Wait! - Hang on tight! You are crazy! May the Saints help you! Out of the way! That's the girl, it must be them, let's go. Out of the way! Excuse me, I thought you were someone else. Is it you? You thought it was Paolo, that idiot? This is the man I'm going to marry! - It wasn't him? - Goodbye. - Bye. - Bye. It's him! Hi, love! You're crazy. You came all the way here for that nonsense. - Yes, excuse me. - I could even slap you for that! I'm so happy! Do you know how to ski? Paolo, are they all millionaires? They come from all over Europe, they are guests of Marquise Filangeri. - Where is she? - There. She is the president of the international charity association. It's too bad Bartolomeo isn't here, he really admires her. - Where is Rita? - She's getting dressed. - Let's go see her? - Ok. How elegant! The Marquise must be very rich to put on an evening like this. - Rita, are you ready? - Little potato! - Dear! - She's not here. - Where could she be? - We start in five minutes. - Is Rita ready? - Have you seen Miss Santangelo? - She's not here? - She had a phone call. - Phone call? Who could it be? - Good evening. Have you seen Miss Santangelo? Yes, she was speaking with a guy. - A guy with a black car. - A black car? - What does this guy look like? - He is tall and has a beard. - Red? - It's Bartolomeo! - So he kidnapped her! - Yes, without a doubt. - She was kidnapped? - How did he manage to do that? With an excuse. - Should we start the show? - Something terrible has happened. - Rita was kidnapped! - Kidnapped? - Good Lord! - What are we going to do? - Go look for her. - No, you have to do the show! Hey, one moment! How about something crazy? Have them bring us some hot punch. It's freezing here! You thought you'd run away? You underestimated your father. How could I let you stain our name with ridiculous singing adventures? Since you don't respect our name, we will teach you to do so. You kidnapped me pretending to have had an accident. You said that my aunts were injured and wanted to see me one last time. I believed you guys. - It was a strategy. - The end justifies the means. We'd do everything for our good name. - Good! - There won't be any famous singer, only lots of people having fun. - Guys, let's start! - This should have been your show! - Good! - Nice! - Extraordinary. - Wonderful! She's delightful. Director, who is the star? It's a woman that's saved us all. It's Mrs Santangelo, the commanders wife. The wife of that annoying man? Incredible! I want to know her. - How dare you? - Silence! Where's my wife? I'm commander Santangelo! - She's with the Marquise! - Yes, she liked the show. There's also the minister! Embarrassing! Bring me a drink. - Who is he? - The one with the beard! Everything went fine, but if Rita was here, she would have been... - Guys! - Rita! You are back! - Am I still in time? - Yes! Hurry! She ran away! No, not my daughter! There is your husband! Commandant! I am sorry for what happened. This woman is a revelation! You kept hidden these two treasures from us! I asked your wife to be part of the institution, we need young and innovative elements. - You must be proud. - I am very proud! The minister wants to meet you. - I don't understand. - You never understood a thing. - Nice to meet you. - I am honored. Thank you. You have a wonderful wife. Yes I do. Yes, you are right. What did you tell the aunties? I send them to hell, just like you said. Can you forgive me for all these years? - On one condition. - Which one? Come dance the Shake with me. The Shake? Maria Cristina, it's not proper. - Let's wait for Rita, where is she? - With her Paolo. - At this hour? It is almost dawn! - But it is New Year's Eve! They are engaged. This love of ours can't be hidden. Can't be hidden this great love. I swear, my love, that I will defend it, that I will protect it. This great love. This love of ours can't be hidden. Can't be hidden this great love. I swear, my love, that I will defend it, that I will protect it this great love.
