And that they make you feel inferior, also? Who said I'm inferior? I think you tell the truth, but I understand your situation. Try to avoid racism. No, I'm just trying to avoid a weak army. And here you feel like there. Go to the point! I am also horrified of racism. - Y? Sometimes there is equality between the races. Where? In Ireland? Closer. Cuba among others. Will not you be one of those communists? You are from the people of the town. You have reason and I'm proud of that. But first of all, I am a man. What is far from being your case. Thanks to your friends they make fun of you I do not buy that. For me, you He is as enemy as anyone. How could he be your enemy? You do not know anything about me. I know him Really?

What the hell am I going to wear? I do not have what to wear. Tom, we have to go, do not we? We have time. Of course, the communist world Is not perfect, for many reasons, the Russians are reluctant, to a schism with China, but in Cuba, Communism is young, and all colors are worth. The revolutionary fever ... It is in the air. Everything that happens There is the future. The national liberation is extended, and the blacks will be the first in enjoying that. when it's beginning to project the future. I should go to there, to Cuba. Friend, that is exactly, what I'm going to do, and Mr. Palmer and his plane they will take me. But Tom, what is he going to do? to take it there? With this. You want to go there, either way. I have my reasons. And why me? The issue is that here You will always have problems. I think that still I'm going to stay here. You will not tell Mr. Palmer What I spoke with you? I do not play like that. That is your problem, not mine. I just need your wife. Pi nselo and despite everything, I could change my mind. I will tell you. I will send you a telegram. - Come on, Mr. O'Bannion! - Good 1 You are truly a very lucky client, Mr. O'Bannion. - Good bye, Rufus! - Vixen! The refrigerator is full, ... ...take care of the house,... ...we will be back soon. Mr. O'Bannion, I accept your offer. Excellent! Mr. Brook He joins us With us? Yes, I invited him. - Not with me, yes ... - Vixen ...! I do not care if it's you the king of England. I do not want this scarecrow close to me, Tom, I do not even want let him enter my house. Mrs. Palmer, I invited you, ... ... I do not care about his color. It's a human. It is social decadence that provoke that feeling in you, You are as weak as What is your country? All the western empire is in decline and it ... ... it's because of people like you, ... that his country is approaching to the fall. Excuse me, for me It's very important, I want him to come, if not ... change of plane. For me it's fine. We have place for four. Yes, Vixen? ... Vixen? Oh, come on! Suba, Niles! We arrived in six hours. Roba? I do not envy him. Can you fly Mrs. Palmer? Only if necessary. I found out Well, let's try ... Let's make this trip the most pleasant than what could happen to us. I agree. You have to relax, after all ... - ... we're going to spend the day together. - Yes ... Have you flown before, Niles? Little Tom, never in a small plane. We must go through the control of immigration. Is it necessary? It is the procedure. Is it necessarily essential? You have to land. Go to Sacramento. It is illegal. I do not care much,... ... with six stops for the essentials, ... ... we will be in Havana in 30 hours. I can go after where ... after having left us. Are you with him, Niles? You knew all along, did not you? - Yes or no? - You commit a international crime. I know what I do. - Obey! - Niles! I'm going to land. Do not be an idiot. I will not hesitate to use this gun. It will not be the first time. I will not go far without me. His wife will pilot the plane, ... ... if he wants to live. It's a pity that he does not have any secret to sell for Cubans. He's going to offer lectures ... about our conditions of work in America, in Canada? Possibly. Oh, but if he speaks! Announce it, Tom. I thought he was dead. So, what are you going to say to him? to those Cubans? What is worse here What in your house? Here we ask you Fight for your country. It's true! You said it, ... we spend millions for bombs, make me kill for nothing, and I have no right to work. and another reason: relate me with more treatable people. The communists are poorer than in America, but we are all the same. Yes, but some of us are better than others, Mr. O'Bannion. Everything they did for me, is to let me out. There are 50,000 blacks, They do not think like you. They are ignorant. Ah, but you're a very smart guy! You gave up your country thanks to a communist. You really woke up, thinking all the time ?. That's it, baby. Then this is, your revenge with me? You are not worth more than your tribe. You would not have dared without a weapon Little white whore. Stop, Niles. We already have a lot of problems. Very good advice, Mr. Palmer. And Niles, calm! What she seeks is only your anger. I'm up to the balls of this, I get sick of the boludeces of the communists and the democracies. What I do, I do for me. That's it. You also do the same. Why? We are totally the same. In Cuba, we work for the good of all. I am not a Cuban peasant. No, Rufus, you're the prince Congo black If you are wise, Castro will leave you enter your country. Maybe, I can understand you what you have done here, no? ... Will you understand, Mr. O'Banion? It is not time to discuss. He does not want to talk about that. It's strange, do not you think Rufus? What does he say about this? Do you close your mouth, black? You have to support the leaders. Support the leaders of the town. I already understood that. What are you? Are you a leader? The military is it. C llate! Mr. O'Bannion has no more humor. Silence! Just a moment, tambi n should I shut up? What I want you to shut up and there is no further discussion. Should I shut up? Please. You are weird, weird, You. the pro-Cubans. C llate! That is not it? Find me, no? Catch me? Calm me, what? Shut up, black! Stop! The plane! Take over. Very good, it's over. How are you, Niles? Calling the tower, we ask ... permission to land. Permit granted, track 111. Wind at three knots at 180 degrees. Received. Do not do that. It's the law, Niles. Let's go back to Canada. Always the same. C llate! "Drop that damn weapon, Niles! Only Tom and I know how to pilot. If you do it wrong, I do not respond to my actions. You think whatever you want, But I really care. I can fly it, ... but I can also not do it. Cessner 69, they're in sight. Land on track 1.0.6. because of air traffic. Received. Track 1.0.6. You do good, Niles. For here. Thanks for everything. I leave it to you. This guy is not worth anything. You are the least worse of the two. Niles ... Everything is fine, Vix ... - Hello, Tom! Sra. Palmer! - Hello, George! What happened with the traveler? Call Customs. Oh, Tom, I have a couple for you. They want to go fishing, if it is said that way Thanks, Georges.
