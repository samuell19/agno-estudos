Episode 19 You win. What is it? About Jae-Ha? Su-Ho... left because of Eun-Young's operation debt. He didn?t abandon Eun-Young. He did it for Eun-Young. Now that I've said everything? it feels better. It feels good. Oppa! Eun-Young! Are you allowed to walk outside freely? Yes. Oppa, I?m going to get an operation. Oh... really? Someone has been generous enough to pay for it. The nice people are going to help me. Oh? are you serious? That?s great news. Jae-Ha has left Korea. He didn't pick up his handphone. And no one knows where he is. Eun-Young, do you know where Jae-Ha is? Ahjumma, it?s me Eun-Young. Oh, it is you Eun-Young. Is Mi-Jeong fine? Yes. Umm... ahjumma, you?ve seen him before, haven?t you? That guy, Yoon Jae-Ha. Oh yes, I do remember him. The piano. Yes. I was wondering if you saw him there? Oh, okay... It's nothing really. I'm going to go now. What?s going on? Jae-Ha has not been seen for a few days? The company called today, asking if Jae-Ha was at home. I thought he was trying to avoid us but that isn?t it. Then, have you tried calling him? He won't answer. He won?t receive his calls. We should?ve never moved into the hotel. Then none of this would?ve happened. What are we going to do honey? That?s why I told you earlier, forget about everything and return back to Austria. Honey, calm down and let's wait. It was us that put Jae-Ha through all of this. It was us! Honey... honey? Editor Kim, what sort of article is it? Yoon Jae-Ha? It's related to Yoon Jae-Ha and Song Lee-Na?s marriage news. Do you want coffee? I will go and buy... Why not? Let?s go. Where are you off to, sir? What!? You?re leaving already? You have to live a long, healthy life. That way, I can come back to see you again. Alright. When you were young you used to be hungry a lot, but now that you're older do you still get hungry a lot? I remembered, so I've prepared something for you. Here are some candies. Hurry up and go. Otherwise you will miss your next boat. It looks yummy. It was nice back then too. Thank you for the food. Alright, come back again okay? Yes, grandpa. Be healthy okay? I will return. Alright, alright. Grandpa! And you are? It?s me! Eun-Young. When I was young, a kid?I came by the boat with Su-Ho Oppa?and he was hurt back then and you treated him. Oh, your brother came! I was wandering why he didn?t bring you along. Su-Ho oppa came? It was him who came right, Grandpa? Where is he? Ahh?yes he's well grown! When did he grow that tall? Where is Su-Ho? Where is he, grandpa? He left, of course. He took the boat and left. I even gave him some treats. Do you want some? I?m leaving to find my dad. It's dangerous? it's dangerous? don?t come... Oh... we?re alive! This is it! We?re alive, Eun-Young! You're hungry, aren?t you? No, not hungry at all. By the way, what are we going to do if there aren?t any people living in this village? Just wait over here. I will search around and come back. Su-Ho oppa! Eun-Young! Do you think there is an owner for those islands? Why? If not, I will take the big island, and you can have the smaller island. Then we are siblings! The island is still the same. We?re the same too. Suh Eun-Young. Why didn?t you tell me? That you left to save me. Even if I did, your tears wouldn't have stopped. Even if I told you, my sins would not have been erased. I will forgive your sins. Oppa, you had such a hard time, because of me... you had such a hard time. Now that I know why Su-Ho became a Yoon Jae-Ha?I forgive you for everything? So never say that again! Eun-Young. Do you know how long I?ve been waiting to hear that? When I woke up in the hospital, I really wanted to hear ?Eun-Young ah, Suh Eun-Young." I was expecting to hear it. I would?ve felt that I was coming back to life. Thank you. For coming back into my life. Thank you so much. I trust you Fate does not hide from us. So that the scar in your heart doesn't last, grab my hand. I'll melt it all away. My heart flutters. Because I was always behind you, maybe you didn't know. At the end of the tunnel, I want to confess to you That I love you. To me, the sad winter disappears like a dream after I met you To me, spring goes by slowly You're flowing into my heart I'll give you the memory of my heart's inscribed love for you Hello? Yes? Jae-Ha? I've found Su-Ho oppa. Su-Ho oppa?? That?s great. Yeah. Ah! What are you doing!? I will give you another call soon? Oh?okay. Bye! Where is Jae-Ha? Are you just not telling me? Eun-Young has also disappeared. The two of them are together right now. Phillip! Are you really just going to watch them? You can?t leave them together, Phillip! What am I suppose to do? How can you say that as if it?s a stranger's business? I can't force her to love me, okay? I?m not going to beg for love. No matter what, I won?t leave the two of them together. Lee-Na! Let it be! Those two?they?re meant for each other. Okay they?ve fought enough for their love. Let them be. Don?t try to fool yourself and try to be honest with yourself. You are having a difficult time, and you want to be with Eun-Young!!! Yes, I love her, I want to be with her, I want to make her smile. But there?s no space for us. Okay? Not 15 years ago, not today. I could never do what Jae-Ha did. Could you? I could never give up my life and live with someone else. What are you talking about? It was because of Eun-Young?s operation that Jae-Ha left. Yoon Jae-Ha, you?re really a jerk. Since you?ve done so much for Eun-Young ssi, are you telling me to give up? You've waited for a long time, huh? You?re still the same as when you were young. Really? Did the two of you meet? Yes, grandpa. Weren?t you siblings? Did the two of you marry? And is she your wife? Ah? no! This must be fate. The both of you came when you were young as well?it must be fate. Why did you come alone when you?re married? Did you argue? It's not like that? Even if you do argue, it should happen in the same room. Why are your clothes wet? Do you have extra clothes to change into? Don?t cross this line okay? This house, it only has one mattress. What... Don?t come near this line.. I have eyes too. There's two mattresses, so why would I go over? What? No homework today? Back then you did. I have completed all my homework, including yours? Mine? I forgave your sins. You did very well! Here give it. I really don?t care whether you are Lee Su-Ho, or Yoon Jae-Ha. You are? Eun-Young?s oppa. Since I gave you a stamp, you are now eternally my oppa, okay? Let?s go to bed. Oh... right... let's sleep... "Yoon Myun-Hoon, the Minister of State and also a powerful candidate for presidency, draws suspicion." Lee Jung-Tae, the Pianist, is Yoon Jae-Ha's Real Father! Honey... Is there something in the newspaper? No, nothing much. You have to go to work. I called in absent today because you were sick. Any calls from Jae-Ha? Don?t worry, everything will be fine. Everything?is entirely my fault. Currently rumors are spreading that pianist Yoon Jae-Ha is an adopted son. Yoon Jae-Ha?s real name is Lee Su-Ho? Come again! Eun-Young, you?re here? Mom? Who do you think you are to be here!!! Mother, I will explain everything. Mother? Who?s your mother? Who the hell is your mom! Mom... Let go of me!!! Leave, never come back! Sang-Woo what are you doing? Kick him out!!! Mom...mom! Mom, don?t hate him. I will explain everything. Are you out of your mind? Do you have brains? How dare you bring him here! Aren't you afraid that your mom is looking up from above!? It?s not that mom! He's a poor guy too. It was because of me. He did it because he wanted to save me! He was adopted to pay for my surgery. He thought I died, he thought my operation failed, mom. How can I hate him?! He's a poor guy too. Let's forgive him. Be quiet! Be quiet!! Because of him, your mother died. Even without him you could still have had the surgery. You would have survived and so would your mom!!! Ahhh Hae-Soon... I?m really sorry...I really am sorry mom... I don?t think you have time to worry about my sister. Mother... Jae-Ha! Jae-Ha, Jae-Ha where were you? What?s going on? Oh? nothing... Jae-Ha, I?m sorry for everything, so please don?t leave. Okay, Jae-Ha? Your mother doesn?t know anything about what?s in the papers. How did this happen? I think Lee-Na planned it. Lee-Na? Lee-Na is the only one who knows about the family?s secret. If you married Lee-Na sooner, this would have never occurred. Telling our secrets should have gone well. Because we didn't tell the secret well, it became like this. As your parents, we have done everything we could. But you disappointed us. No one would?ve guessed that the situation would come to this stage. There is no point for us to discuss this right now. We have to stop the press. Everyone, including Lee-Na and Eun-Young, has found out that I am not the real Jae-Ha. Hiding it won't make any difference. Father... why don?t we confess? Don?t you know what's bound to happen if we reveal everything? On top of that, think about your mother. We have to stop this. If something happens to you, your mother's condition will fall. Just like 15 years ago, we can't go back to that. Yoon Jae-Ha ssi, are you really an adopted son? Is it true? When did you start learning piano? Jae-Ha! Did you really have to do this? It's not me. Who else would it be? Who else would know about the family's business besides you? It's not me! Knowing that you were Lee Su-Ho, I just did it to make you mad. I didn?t want it to explode like this. I'm being honest. Then who else? Hey...hey?it wasn?t her. It was the journalist's friend. It's not her. It's not me Jae-Ha. I didn?t know it would turn out like this. Really. I don?t believe this, how can they put your picture on the newspapers? Life is funny. So are they trying to say that Eun-Young knows who the real Yoon Jae-Ha or Lee Su-Ho is. It's complicated now. So what do they want her to do? Is it Yoon Jae Ha or Lee Su Ho? Once everything is revealed, that family will collapse, including Jae-Ha. Am I suppose to forgive him and think of Eun-Young? Or feel bitter towards him? Mom, you should forgive him. Think of Eun-Young. Hey, do you think that?s as easy as just saying it out loud? Think of your aunty. Oh, are you Suh Eun-Young ssi? Can I please interview you? Leave! It will only take a few minutes. Hey, take him out! Just a few minutes? What is it that you want to know? Cheer up, you?re still young. Throughout life, things happen. Don?t be depressed over that. How are you going to continue on? Smiling is my specialty. I will smile more often now. Alright. Also, he did save you. And I don't feel right being mean to him. Mom! So cheer up! Your pocket money. What's the office atmosphere like? It?s surrounded by journalists. You know that you will have a party for the election results next week, right? I know. Right after my office empties out, I'll go. Yes, the president wants to see you before the final results. He would like to hear your opinions directly. I am Jae-Ha's father. I?ve seen you on television. I am so thankful to you for looking after my son so well. But, why? I have come to request something in relation to Jae-Ha. Sorry? I don?t quite understand. Oh, my! He looks exactly the same as my Su-Ho. If somebody else saw this they would?ve mistaken them for twins. And what happened to this child? He died. I'm sorry to ask such a question. My Su-Ho must be like your own son. I was so surprised, I couldn't believe that my son is a famous pianist. No one would believe me, I don?t know whether this is a dream or an illusion. As you can see, there is no difference between the two kids. Yes, that?s true. So I'm trying to say?and please don?t be offended when I say this. Sooner or later it will be revealed that you are the real father of Jae-Ha. Once that truth is revealed. I believe you know what will happen to Jae-Ha. The best solution is for you to say that you're not the father of Yoon Jae-Ha. He's telling me to say that my son is not my son. Why should I do that? No way. What are you going to do? If you choose love, you go against the parents will. If you choose the parents, love will cry. It's like some sad love story movie. How can this happen? Hey Eun-Young, if Yoon Jae-Ha said that he is Yoon Jae-Ha, then what happens? Will you guys break up? Why can't you guys just meet behind the media? No, you will be caught no matter what. Then if he stays with Song Lee-Na, will Su-Ho be safe? Su-Ho. Jae-Ha. How are you? I'm great. It's my first time, being at somewhere like this... Why are you here? Just?I wanted to see your face. If I don?t come, then you will never come to see me again. How's Eun-Young? Is she alright? Take care of her, all right? I can manage it myself, without you telling me. You probably took care of her well, that?s why you?ve grown into a big success. Mother is sick, so I have to head to the hospital. Why are you here? I?ve told you. I wanted to see your face. When was it that you left me? And now you?re looking for me? I'm leaving. Su-Ho.. What? Whatever they say, you are still my son. What do you mean? You are?my son. Tomorrow? Yes...I understand. Mr. Kim, can you please arrange for a press conference? Yes. Jae-Ha... Jae-Ha... Honey... Yoon Jae-Ha's real dad is a loser. Yeah...how can that sort of man have that type of son? If this is all true then what will happen to Yoon Jae-Ha? I don't know? A press conference? Yes. The election will begin soon. The only way to settle everything is by calming the media down. Reveal that you are Yoon Jae-Ha. No, why should I do that? You know why. Everyone is under your control. By you saying that you are Yoon Jae Ha, everyone will believe you. I will return as Lee Su-Ho now. I don?t care if I don?t play the piano anymore. I will confess everything. Stop constraining my business. I know your having a difficult time because of the matter, However, don?t just think about yourself. It's not a constraint. You?re my son. This is an order. But, Father... Do as you like Jae-Ha. Do as you like. I will let you go. Whether you live as Yoon Jae-Ha or Lee Su-Ho, you are my son. Honey. Let him go, honey. Let's stop controlling him. You and I can both give up. Why is it so important? I thought I would be happy if Jae-Ha was with us. But that?s not true. We are blocking Jae-Ha's path. Now, I want to release Jae-Ha. Mother. I love you, my son. You might think you are Lee Su-Ho, but you are still my son. My real son, who I?ve taken care of for 15 years. I don?t care which direction you are choosing, I just want you to be happy, you have to be happy. You know perfectly well what's happening to Jae-Ha, don?t you? Yes, I do. Please help. Please help me so he doesn?t collapse, Eun-Young ssi. You should know better who Jae-Ha would be happier with? I also don?t want oppa and his relationship with his parents to be interrupted. Then you know what I?m going to say next? If you continue to meet Jae-Ha, then Lee Su-Ho would be revealed. Then, not only will everyone have a difficult time but so would his parents, Eun-Young ssi? Su-Ho oppa? I don?t want him to have a hard time because of me again. As long as he's happy, whatever decision he makes, I won?t care. We both love the same person, but the way we express love is different. I don?t think either of us is wrong, because we both grew up differently. Eun-Young, please don?t see me as a bad person. The only person who can settle this chaos is me. So please leave so that Jae-Ha and I can marry. I will get up first. You are my forever, oppa. If that is true, what will happen to Yoon Jae-Ha? You're here. Why did you call me to come here? This is the first place we met after all those years. This seat? If only I knew? And? What would you have said? I don?t know. I would have been happy knowing that you were alive. I'm hungry. You too, right? Wait a minute. You used to like this. I saw it before. You remember useless things. It tastes good. I? don?t care what choice you make... What are you talking about... To me, you are my oppa. We even gave each other stamps...kwang! Even if you live as Yoon Jae-Ha, to me you are just my oppa... Eun-Young. Just because you can't see it, doesn?t mean it's not there. Even if you hide Lee Su-Ho, all you have to do is recognize me. No, Eun-Young... Whether I am Park Eun-Young or Suh Eun-Young... To you, I am still Eun-Young. To the editors, I will reveal everything as of today. Please ask me questions. I will ask the question everyone is curious about. Yoon Jae-Ha ssi, are you Lee Su-Ho or Yoon Jae-Ha? I will tell you... I am...
