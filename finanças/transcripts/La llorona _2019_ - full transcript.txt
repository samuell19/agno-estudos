THE CHORONA CHORONA (still untitled in Brazil) No medals. Dark suits, but not black. Matt color, without shine. Clean white shirts. The tie in a double windsor. They need to be spotless. Remember that they are heroes, not victims. And in no way lower your head. If the general falls, he'll drag us along. And at our age, any sentence means perpetual. They have become cowards over the years. It was a pleasure. Thanks for everything. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. - Do you want to sleep here with me? - No, very hot. Why do you speak ill of grandpa? - Do your friends speak ill of him? - No, on the internet. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Grandparents, ancestral spirits, accept this light as an offering. We pray for Don Enrique, your family and this house. We offer this light so that all evil leave this place and that everything gets right. We ask for protection from our loved ones. We offer this light, we pray and we ask with all our hearts. Letona! - Don Enrique, it's me, Valeriana. - Letona! Valerian, take his gun. - Enrique. - Give me the gun. You heard that woman cry too. You heard her cry too. Give me the pistol. Sir, release it. It's Valerian. Search the rooms. The guerrillas planted a spy here. - Okay, but let go. - This is an order! Did anyone hear a woman cry? Are you sure? It was a nightmare, that's all. Someone entered the house. I heard it. It was Chorona. Did he hear you from far or near? In the ear. So she is far away. Quiet! - What did you say? - Nothing. He's getting older, that's what is happening. Pass me the pistol. For the safety of all, I will guard it. We need to call a carpenter. Your poor father. It is not for less. With everything they do to him it's normal to go crazy. Stress accelerates Alzheimer's. He still has good aim. That was close. You could have killed me. After the verdict he will get better. MS. Carmen, the employees want to leave. Valerian, please tell me now is a bad time. My mom needs help with my dad. See how the poor fellow is doing. You can't leave her alone. My parents provided a house, food, a good salary and treat you like family. They even buy your tortillas. Nowhere else will they be treated like this. Reconsider, please. This is a delicate moment. Everyone is afraid. They are ungrateful. Latvia, get the car ready, please. Otherwise, it will be late. All set, lady. MS. Carmen, before they go, they want to receive the salary. Nowhere else will you find work. Is Enrique ready? The guerrilla ran away when I heard that the army was approaching. I didn't even notice. When I saw the fire, I grabbed my kids and ran. The violence came suddenly. First they burned the fields, then the houses, our clothes and animals. In addition, they separated women and children of the men left over. We women were raped. And then the massacres started. Silence. Some of us managed to escape to the mountains. Up there, we'll be protected by the clouds when the helicopters came looking for us. Since there was no food, we need to go down. That was when I was arrested and taken to the military camp. There the soldiers did what they wanted with me. I was not the only one. We hadn't done anything. We are only going to our homes. I'm not ashamed to tell you what I went through. I hope you are not ashamed to do justice. That is all, very merit. Thank you, Witness 82. The process has already taken two months. General Monteverde guarantees that in his mandate guerrillas were made up of entire communities. They were all part of the revolt. According to the defense, no civilians were killed, only armed guerrillas. The general insists that there was no genocide. But according to the victims he perpetrated genocide. Madam, your tea. They remember that between 1982 and 1983 the armed forces murdered an average of 3,000 people a month. Equivalent to 33% of the Maia Ixil people. According to the Prosecutor's Office, the military wanted to exterminate them to occupy its oil-rich lands in the north of the country. Let's go back? In several interviews, the general said that... people are to the guerrillas what water is to fish. If you want to end the fish, you need to end the water first. Internationally, he is known as one of the dictators most bloodthirsty in Latin America. Mr. Monteverde, a word please. General Enrique Monteverde never affirmed, never proposed, never ordered the Guatemalan army attempt against any race, any ethnicity or no religion. That is why in Guatemala there was no genocide. I give the floor to the Hon. general Enrique Monteverde. Your Honor, I know that this process is very important. And that Guatemala deserves respect. But you know well that my intention was to create a national identity... Genocide! Please silence. I declare myself innocent. I don't know what I'm being accused of. The Public Ministry presented evidence, testimonies, expertise and official military documents in which it is considered the entire Mayan Ixil people as enemies of the state. 38% of the victims were children under 12 years old. This damage done goes beyond all human understanding. There was profound damage not only to the direct victims of the massacres as with all Guatemalan social fabric. Telling the truth helps to heal the wounds of the past. Whereas... General Enrique Monteverde was aware of the massacres occurred under his command and did nothing to stop them, despite having the power to do so is declared guilty of genocide. Excuse me! Take him to the hospital. You need to go to the hospital. Know that there are more than 1,500 cases of people willing to give false testimony in exchange for money. And where do you think that money comes from? Of the people. What do you think of the judges' actions? The judge is a criminal. I want to see you behind bars. - I need to take out the cigarette, sir. - That judge should be arrested. One thing is right. Heaven sent an angel to look after me. Thanks. Did my father tell you everything? Do you think he did all those things or did he just give the orders? Do you believe these prostitutes more than your own father? What prostitutes? Those days that you testified in court. They're whores paid to lie. Oh, mother. I don't believe you are able to invent these things. They would have to live to tell them like that. Because your father said they showed up at the barracks. Some even breastfeeding. The benevolent generals offered cleaning jobs. But the low-ranking soldiers used them as whores. I remember that when Dad went to the barracks, you always fought. You cried because he had other women. Yes. Even though they are generals, they are men. Furthermore, they came to seduce them. I don't mean just that, but everything else. Which side are you on? Won't you say you believe all these communists? Do not mix things up. Since when did you become a leftist? Who you're walking with, count. They already convinced you, you know? I want to know if you were aware. For the country to advance, it is necessary to go ahead. What is left behind is behind. And if we look back, we become statues of salt. I already know what you are thinking and forbid you to think that. We are in the military hospital where General Monteverde has been in custody for 8 days. The Supreme Court overturned the verdict against the former dictator. Representatives of the private sector approved the court's decision, claiming there is no evidence of genocide. General Monteverde must be released this afternoon. The international community reacted negatively to the news highlighting the problems of corruption and impunity in the country. Give me 5 minutes with the doctor, wait. Not now, maybe later. Don't let it in. You promised me an interview. Dr. Monteverde, can we talk about your daughter's father? Since when did he disappear? What do you know about him? Do not meddle in this. And be careful, understand? 250 meters to go. Sir, please give me the cigarette. Your bulletproof vest. Do not talk to the press. Let's go straight in, please. - One hundred meters. - We're ready, sir. - Stay tuned, Garcia. - Yes sir. Fifty meters. Everything is under control. Don't worry. Stay tuned. At my signal, get out. Understood? Don't panic. It is a peaceful demonstration. How did you let so many people pass by? We have to make way. What story is this? Ask for reinforcement! Go ahead. We still want to go further. We're going out. Release the entry. - This is not peaceful, sir. - We have to leave. One two Three. Garcia, open the door now! Get out! Come on, get out! Get out! Everything is fine! Get out! Pass! Pass! Pass it on! GO! Let us through! Go up, go up! Watch out, lady! Get up! Get up! We made it inside. Are you okay? What's your name? - There. - Letona! Please. - Letona! - They didn't steal anything from me, did they? What I need is to be alone. It was horrible. A bunch of savages. Tell Dora to prepare me a bath. - Dora left. - So, Delia. - Everyone left. - Are they all gone? Bunch of ungrateful. After... You need to call the agency so they can send someone. There are a lot of people who want to work. Someone to call urgently, right? - I already called. - Doctor, are you all right? I am, leave us alone. And make these people shut up. Mother, what did they do? - You got dirty. - Did they hurt you? - No, it's not my blood - Whose is it? I think it's a cow. Do not be afraid. Do not be afraid. Everything is fine. I'm here. Mother, I want to go. I don't want to stay here. - Let's go home. - I'm here. Do not be afraid. I want to go. Have you been there a long time? Yes, general. Did you hear someone cry? No. Killer! Do not expose yourself, please. To the guide, Lobo no 12. Check perimeter four. We want justice! We want justice! Killer! Killer! We want justice! We want justice! - Good Morning. - Are you alone? Where are the others? They are afraid. There is a lot of work for you to do on your own. - Who is it? - The new employee. Come in and close the door. They could, but they cannot open that door without authorization. - Is she released? - Yes sir. Enter and wait. Stay here, please. Open your arms. Turn around. I need to check your bag. - It's cleared. - Can I wear long hair? - You can, dear. - I want a dress like hers. I want to show the house. It's better tomorrow. She must be tired. I've been working in this house for 27 years. The food stays here. This drawer is yours. Don't worry. They buy everything for us. Our rooms are there. This is the laundry. Here is the ironing board. The house is very big. Sometimes it seems to be haunted. Stay with me, if you don't want to be afraid. Is that all you have? You buy new things. Anyway, here you will wear a uniform. How is everyone in the village? It's okay. You can shower there. We want them alive! We want them alive! We want them alive! We want them alive! It's an invasion. When will you leave us alone? We'd better stay indoors. It can be dangerous. Anything you need, ask Letona. Did you hear that, Sara? Good news. You won't need to go to school. But I want to go to school. It's only for a few days. I am also not going to work at the hospital. It is not right for women to live alone. They should come and live here. The house is big. Furthermore, here we will be protected by the guards. Think of your daughter. What's that? They are attacking us! - Sara! - Get away from the window! Follow me. Come on, fast, fast! We will. - I'll get Sara. - Are you sure? Yes, stay with my parents. Sara! Sara! I request reinforcements. Calling all units. Sara? Do what we say. Are you ي? Sara? Sara? She is not here. Stay away from the window. I can't find Sara. Those rioters took her away. You went crazy. - She must walk around ي. - They surrounded the main windows. Use tear gas immediately. - Sara? - More flyers. More? - Did they break another window? - Yes. Sara? Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. - Seventeen. - Sara? Eighteen. Release it! What are you doing? Release it! - I almost reached twenty-one! - What are you doing? Alma is teaching me to hold my breath to swim under water. Always stay in sight. Didn't they hear us calling? - Why do you always hide? - Let go. Pay attention. Come help me. They are throwing things. Nobody gives up! Nobody forgets! Enrique Monteverde is a genocide! You must not stay here, Enrique. You can throw stones again. Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice! What we want? We want justice! We want justice! These people will drive me crazy. Alma told me that in her village there was a lot of water and that plants grew quickly. - You like Alma, don't you? - She has two children. Two children? She is still so young! The Indians have children early. A boy and a girl. Who do you leave them with while she works here? They died. Help me, Valerian! He's bothering me. Why are you here? Get out of here! Letona! Help me! Take Mr. Enrique out of here. Good heavens, Daddy! Take it with you. - I can handle it myself. - Calm down. Put him on oxygen, please. Okay. The floor was flooded. I don't want you sleeping in my room. - Up there? - Yes, come up, please. He needs to be hospitalized. This is not Alzheimer's. Nobody is going to accept it. Enrique has always been delighted to chase women. Mainly India. - I put him on oxygen. - Thanks. - Good night. - Good night. Good night, Valerian. All women drive Enrique crazy. Don't think about it. Do not be affected. I never thought that at this age I would go through this. The best thing is that you go to rest. I don't want you to be sick. You too, dear, go to sleep. Did Grandpa do anything to Alma? Go to bed. - Good night. - Good night my dear. - Good night. - Right. I'm going to have a glass of water. In between. Excuse me, Vale. Alma, I apologize on behalf of my father. I ask you to understand. He's very stressed. I promise you it won't happen again. As of tomorrow, you will not be wearing a uniform. It was very fair on you. Put on your dress. - Good night. - Good night. Can you open the shirt, please? Breathe. Again. Your bronchi are heavily loaded. You need to treat this respiratory deficiency. With these people out there, we can't go out. For me you must apologize to Alma. Imagine the scandal, if tomorrow the girl denounces you? Apologize to her, please. As a formality. Do this for us women. - I've always been a sleepwalker. - You were never sleepwalker. The people where are they? For freedom and peace The people where are they? For freedom and peace The people where are they? For freedom and peace - The united people... - They will never be defeated! The united people will never be defeated! If someone forgets, we clarify! Enrique Monteverde is a genocide! If someone forgets, we clarify! Enrique Monteverde is a genocide! Examine my eyes. It looks like conjunctivitis. I feel that there is a lot of humidity in our room. Don't you think it's strange that your father came up with Valerian one day? You were too small. But she was also a child, a little older than Sara. And those acts are not like your father. God sends the toughest trials to his best servants. What are you trying to tell me? That surely Valerian is your half sister م. Oh, mother, please. I need to relax. I thought I got over it. But lately, I can't stop thinking about it. Perhaps it was a blessing sent from Heaven, because what would i do without her? How did you meet Valeriana? You already know. Why didn't you like Sara's father? He didn't love you. Do not confuse the reality. Love you my princess. I know. How beautiful. It really is. We will. At your age, it's normal. - It was an accident. - I know. Without justice, without justice There is no peace! Without justice there is no peace You don't have to use it now, if you don't want to. Without justice, There is no peace! If you need to, you already know where you are. Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty. Twenty one. Twenty two. Twenty three. Twenty four. Twenty five. Twenty-six. Twenty-seven. It can't be. Yes you can. It looks like him. Look carefully. Yes, it looks like it. Look at the other one. Look. - It's him! - It's him. Sara, what are you doing? - Don't play with that. - We're not kidding. Take it to another corner. WHERE IS HE? This historic step in our country. The stage of anti-communism, of the inquisition, of those who repressed and massacred, who committed economic and human genocide under the argument of the fight against communism. After a historic trial, with hundreds of testimonies and the revocation of a genocide sentence, the positions that divide Guatemala's public opinion seem to be more distant every day. Guatemala is tired of crying for their missing. - Here's what you asked me for. - Leave ي, please. And Alma bought this for Sara. Thanks. Is it so risky to leave? Much. This confinement is making us sick. Yes, I understand. Letona... Do you know anything about Sara's father? Doesn't it seem strange to you that he suddenly disappears like that? I do not have access to that information. Nobody knows what he was in for. It is better that you stay away from these matters. Excuse. - Need help? - No. And Sara? Watching TV. Come, sit down. Did Sara see when my mom surprised my dad? - Was she scared? - No. What was Sara's father like? Did Sara tell you about him? She wants to know what he looks like and where he is. My children's father was very thin and smiled a lot. Where is he? I don't know. - Abandoned you? - No. What about you, did he abandon? I never knew. Excuse. Sara's father was called Carlos. He also laughed a lot. - Wind. - Wind. - Fly. - Fly. - Cold. - Cold. - Rain. - Rain. - Water. - Water. Valerian? Valerian! Valerian! What do you say? What do you say? It kills me slowly. It's a curse on you. Take it all off, please. First, we need to purge you. All the hate and words about solid things they must disappear from this house for the good of this family. Ancestors, help us to understand what we did wrong. Protect our family from the devil. Get the demon out of here. We better get in. We will. Come on, mom. I told Juana from your village. I looked for it because we need more help. She said she doesn't know you. Where you are from? From the heart of the mountains. Right next to the river. Where was the military camp stationed? I lived there until the massacre started. How old are you? I don't know anymore. Come on. Sara. Sara! Dad! Enrique, what are you doing? Enrique, no! - No! - The motherfucker hides under the water. - Help! - Give me the pistol! Don't blame me. It's all her fault. It's Sara! No. This guerrilla is under the water. It is my daughter that you will kill! Give me the pistol. Bring my medical bag. Walking! Walking! Get away. Valerian, get away! - Walking. - I am your father. You don't know anything! Hold on tight, Valerian. Leave me! Everything that happens in this house is that woman's fault! Don't get hurt, it's hurting you. Letona! Latvia. Himself. Himself. That sucks. Where are the guards? They are not strong enough for them. My child. My child. Alma screams for her children. She said she knew Grandpa from long ago. What else did she say? That I shouldn't drown. Valerian, what's going on? What have we done? Walk, gather all the candles you can and act. We will. Look. Don't look at them. The hands. I appeal to the four elements and our protective ancestors. Spirits, speak to us through fire. What can we do for you? Spirits, go back to your rest, there is nothing here for you. Forgive us if we offend you. We ask you to leave us alone. If the general owes you any debt, please understand that we have nothing to do with it. Have compassion on us and leave us. Leave us alone. It is unfair to make innocent people pay the consequences. Don't hurt us. We are trying to help. Sara, open your eyes. Breathe, breathe. Please. Tell us what you want. Mother, what is it? MOTHER! Come on! Go here! Tell me where the guerrillas are hiding. I don't understand what you say. My husband is not part of the guerrillas. We were never part of it. Please. Release my children. Tell them where they are or I'll drown them. I don't know. I don't know. My children! My children! My children! My children. My children. My general. My children!
