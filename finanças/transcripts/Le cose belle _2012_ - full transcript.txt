THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS Running, whenever you're ready... Ah... sorry... Nothing. Enzo, is it not better with the headphones? Running, It's said time heals everything, but who knows if time really exists? Maybe time is just a popular belief, a superstition, a practice, a trick, a song... 13 YEARS EARLIER Leave me alone! Giuliano! Adele! Adele! Adele! Adele! Giuliano! Adele! Shoot! Shoot! Goal! Adele scores again! Two great goals by Adele! Two goals for Adele Serra! Hello! I'm Adele Serra. I'm 14 and am in 1st year of middle school. I've been kept back four times because... I'm not really interested in school. First I was kept back because... T answer back to the teachers, then... I won't let them tell me what to do, and I've never. I've always been brave in school. My future? How do I see it? He is too special He spends a fortune dressing well He's not likely to fall For a simple, ordinary girl Who doesn't stand out at all With a girl like me... Adele, do you need the mobile phone? My house, the neighbourhood is Piazza Mercato, over there you can see San Martino. This is my father, Antonio, he sells lovely sweet pastries. This is Emanuele, he's the most spoiled of the family and he's very lively. This is my mum, Carmela, she's a housewife. She helps me to do lots of things, she's a good person. Now I'm going to introduce my sister Jessica, 15. She's in third year of middle school. I'm still in first year, I got kept back four times. This one's good. I was on the swing. I don't need it. Guys, I don't want to do anything else. They won't let me speak. Bloody hell, when they're speaking... My name is Fabio Rippa, I'm in second year, middle school. They won't let me speak, I can't hear a thing. Do it again. My name is Fabio Rippa, I'm in second year, middle school. I was born in 1987, on 12 August. What do we care? Here, they have... Mayor Bassolino... - He's repairing... - Shut up! ...the roads, but he's not thinking of the future of young people. - I was born in 1987, on July 12. - What do we care? The usual neighbourhood ill-mannered. Now I'll tell you about some of the things that happened to me. What do we care? And this is the oaf's oaf, known as Chiccotto. Right, I was saying... When the car bomb blew up, it was made with TNT, I was with my friends, setting off bangers in plastic bottles. I heard a boom, then I fell to the ground and I lost consciousness. I could hear a buzzing in my ears for five minutes. I got to my feet and I could see all this fire. So I ran until I was exhausted, because I get tired running fast. I got home and I cried next to Jesus. I said, "Jesus, don't let there be any dead". A friend of mine, a barman, got 200 stitches... Put the wheel there. 10,000 lire? The bass? The bass is 19,000 lire, or else there's that at 13,000 lire. It's not 5 kilos, though. Check the weight. I need 5 kilos. - 5 and a half. - 55... Mum? How do you feel being the only woman in the market? A satisfied woman, I don't need anything else. Are you not a bit embarrassed with all these men? What? Are you not a bit embarrassed with all these men? When I come to the market, I'm a man, at home, I'm a woman. And when I called you before? What, do you know me now? My name is Silvana, I'm 14. I want to be a model when I grow up. My favourite hobby is volleyball. My favourite singer is Gigi D'Alessio. I'd like to still be a virgin when I get married. I'd like to be! Why did you get them? What do they mean? Why get rid of them? I got them one day when I was all sad in jail. I got them and then when I got out... people were ashamed of them back then. - I used acid to get rid of them. - How did you get rid of them? Just like that. You cut yourself with a blade, then put the acid on. - What did you have here, a woman? - It was a woman, now it's a scribble. It's from when I was young. Because you were a thief. Now I'm a brickie to put food on the table for you. Tell us about the tattoos. - A teddy bear with your name in it. - I'm a lion, not a teddy bear We'll do a lion, then, your sign! On your shoulder? Come on, Dad, if Lina does it, I will too. If Silvana does it, I will too. Soon as I'm 18, 19, I'll leave home and get it done. You've got a cough And you want to smoke You like dancing, you've got a stud In your nose for a joke You're so beautiful, don't change You're a part of the city I mean it, don't you fall in love Girl, you make all the streets Of Naples more beautiful With the sun in your eyes And your strawberry mouth You make people Turn their heads to look at you... The singers I like are the classic ones, like Nino D'Angelo, Mario Merola. Instead, of the popular ones, the best known Pavarotti, Andrea Bocelli... The further away from me you are The closer I feel you Who knows at this moment What you're thinking of What you're doing... Good evening. This is the month of the roses This is the month of love The air is full of scents And the scornful girl Finally sees sense... This is the month of kisses Warm and sticky kisses If I get married tomorrow I'll know to blame the roses The month of May and you... Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Well done. This is Vomero, where the rich people live. I'll show you I know the prices off by heart. Anchovies, 8. Squid, 20. 20. Octopus, 20. 22. Anchovies, 8. Cod you have to weigh, because... Sole, 24. Wow, 32! I'll do the interview before my father goes, but I have to wash and dry my hands or I'll soak the camera. I want to interview the cigarette smuggler The kid's mad! Excuse me, policeman. - Do you like your job? - Of course. Have you ever killed a serial killer? No. - Arrested anyone famous? - No. So what are you doing in the police? Let's hope my friends are there. Straight on. - I'm Enzo, do you remember me? - You lived there... I've moved house a lot of times, I'm a singer now. I sing in Piazza Bellini, we do a bit of everything. - Valerio's there. - Let's go. Excuse me, do you know where Valerio is? Valerio who? Raia? - What? - Raia? Valerio, a boy... - I'm Valerio. - You're Valerio? Oh, my God! Do you remember me ? It's Enzo who used to live there. Back in the day, we were right rascals. I still remember the time Valerio wanted to make me drink from a glass that was full of dirt. I don't know... What can I say? For example... in Naples there aren't any kids, for example, who say, "Hello! How are you ? Everything all right? How's your family?" Instead, no, in Naples, it's all "What do I care about your family?" Instead here, it's lovely, I like it. But also where I lived before... In fact, I said to my father, "Dad, I'd like to come back here, to Giugliano or Melito." Because, to tell the truth, they're my favourite towns. Silvana, what am I meant to say? Help me... Tell him your name, how old are you, where you live. Wait, I don't get it. What have I to do? What your dreams are, you want to be a model... You want to be a model? Say you want to be a model. Like Silvana, I want to be a model. You have to go to school to be a model. You have to go to school to be a model. - You have to study. - You have to study. It's not a problem for us that Mum's not here, because we grew up with Dad, and the happiness that Mum didn't give us, Dad did. When she left, I was on the balcony. I looked at her but I didn't go down. She always asks me why. I don't know if I could have a different future with her. I stayed with my father and this is the future I have. I'll batter you! I'm warning you, I won't tell you again. Let's start with Mummy. My mum's name is Enza. How old is she? She's 38. My mum lives here in this house. - She left my father four years ago. - Five. In March it's four years, but don't cry or I won't say anything else. Five years. I don't want to say anything else, you're crying already. Come here, come on. Silvana! Do it for Gran, come on. Silvana, you could have told me, I'd have dolled myself up. You're fine the way you are. You always said, "You can have 100 fathers but only one mother" but what did you mean? That the person who counts in a family is the mother, because she gives you something the father can't. If the mother dies, can you have children? You have to find another woman. If something goes wrong in a birth and the mother is at risk, what does the man say, "Rather the child than the mother," because you can have hundreds of children, but not mothers. When I was born, were you dying? We both were, so I said, "God, I've another two at home. If someone has to die, let it be my daughter!" But I didn't say that out of hate. Now I'm going to go wild with the pole. I don't know how to speak. I can only express myself when I'm dancing, that's how I speak. If I quit school, what will you do? Eh, what will I do? Find a job for yourself. If I became an actress, what would you do? Adele, your mum believes in you, but... I don't think you're going to be an actress. Don't get carried away. What do you think of my personality? Now you can say I'm stupid. I'm not going to say you're stupid, all I'll say is... You're not the way I'd have liked you to be. - You're aggressive. - Jessica taught me that. No, that's not true. You can't blame her, Adele. Don't argue, don't argue. Who do you love most, me, Manu or Jessica? The way he speaks is different With a thousand stories He has to tell His eyes might be even more Blue than the sea And he doesn't stand out at all What's he going to have to do With a girl like me... It's Jessica, where are you? I'm in Pianura as well. You're at Pescopagano? I'm going to see my aunt. Can you tell me Jessica's story in a few words? Jessica is Giovanni. When she was about ten, we found out she was different. She wore skirts, she would dress up. These girls should be accepted in the family because for me she's a girl to all intents and purposes. She's my daughter and she'll be treated like a girl. You don't reject a child because they're different. You love them even more. Are you happy with this life? Happiness doesn't exist, there are moments of joy, and we have to just learn to make the most of it, live. The further away from me you are The closer I feel you Who knows at this moment... Get lost I! Don't worry, go on! What you're thinking of What you're doing You've put a sweet poison Into my veins This cross I bear for you Is so heavy I want you I think of you I call you... What's your repertoire? Classic Neapolitan. How many songs do you sing, and where? I sing with my father in the restaurants. In winter that's only on Sundays, though. What about you? I don't really like Neapolitan songs that much. I like foreign music, international stuff. Like... wait... Michael Jackson, that kind of stuff? Yeah, my favourite group is 5ive. Do you plan to change your repertoire at some point? No, I go to the conservatory and what comes out, comes out. I understand. Always classic Neapolitan. Bye. I have to say Marinella has really changed. I like her more now. When she was younger, she did silly things, playing hide-and-seek... She's grown up now, she's more beautiful now because... she's more stable... she's more of a woman, she's grown up. I really prefer her now. She's changed, she's really beautiful. TWELVE YEARS LATER Who is it? Good morning, ma'am, phone company, could you open the gate? Thank you. - Telecom? - No, ma'am, Tele2. Sorry, I've got Fastweb. No, I was asking you just to open the gate, I'm doing door to door. - All right, I'll open up. - Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, ma'am. We're here about the phone. We've got a special offer on Tele2. We have a special rate of 15 euros a month. That's 30 euros every two months, until 31 December. Then after that you pay 38.90 a month... That's expensive, I'm not interested, I prefer Telecom. Expensive? 15 euros a month? It's 30 euros every two months. Yes, but Telecom is more reliable. All right. Goodbye. Good morning. You got a phone? - Who's your telephone company? - I've got an old phone. - Telecom? - Yes. - What do you pay a month? - I don't know. - Have you got internet? - Inter...? Internet, broadband. My wife would know. Where is your wife? - Upstairs. - Will we go and see her? - I said to speak to her... - Who's your telephone supplier? - Telecom? What do you pay a month? - 110, 120... Silvana, have you finished? Mum, why don't you take Antonella? Where are the results? In the wardrobe, the blue bag, right or left, I don't know. You get them, I don't feel well. - What's the doctor doing tomorrow? - I don't know. They might have to operate again. He'll tell me. On 11 May, the CCTV of a bank in the Sanita neighbourhood of Naples filmed the entrance to a bar. Aman goes into the bar, walks the length of it, comes back, pulls out a gun and fires twice at his victim, once in the back, once in the head. Bacioterracino dies... Silvana, have you finished? People say Maria has gone They say they saw her Kneeling in a church She was clutching a child Born out of sin And then, after, in silence, Nobody heard anything else And where's Maria now? What's Maria doing? Maria's not called Maria any more And how is Maria? Who's Maria with? Does Maria still remember me? She'll be in America And won't "speaka" Italian any more Or maybe she's sleeping In the underground She'll be singing an American song Or maybe she's singing O Sole Mio In Secondigliano And where's Maria now? What's Maria doing? MUM, WE LOVE YOU Being a parent's a duty, not a right. You done? They seem good. Just an allergy. Now, give me a cigarette. No, no cigarettes. They've stopped me doing so many things. Just give me one. - In front of the hospital? - So what? Here, smoke. - You can get as angry as you like! - But smoke it slowly. Hey, good morning! - You know what time it is? - What time is it? What time is it? What can I do with you, Fabio? Come on, I've just woken up. That's all you can do: crawl! - Slowly, slowly, he's coming to. - He's looking for the cigarettes. He hasn't even got his eyes open and he's having a cigarette! Am I supposed to support you, Fabio? You want an ice cream for your girl, I've to give you the money? I'm trying to understand. You're sighing as well! At least if they're born female, they can work as whores! Aziz! Aziz! I'll give you a coffee, get down! His boss refuses to pay him. Five years he worked, looking after the cows. You know what he said? He was talking to himself. "They're going to come and kill me!" to himself. And then he did this at 1 in the morning. Good morning, hello, we're here about the phone. Have you got one? Who's your supplier? Ma'am? Good morning, we're here about the phone, have you got one? - No, thank you. - OK. All right. It was a pleasure, ma'am. Have a good day. Good morning. Have you got a land line? No, and we don't want one. You as well I Everyone's got it in for land lines! We've got one. - I asked five or six times. - All right. - You're not interested? - I've got a mobile. And don't you have to top it up? Sometimes. Can I say something? If you don't have money, you don't use a mobile. If you don't pay the land line, they cut you off. But it's 8 euros a month, 16 euros every two months, to have a land line and you can make all the calls you want. - For ever, though? - For ever. Gran's not there. She's at home, we're going now. Good evening. Wait, Manu, move your hands. Excuse me, don't make me nervous. "MISS ITALY TRANS" Wait, click here. It's always these photos... Scroll down. It's Jessica. - There she is. - Click there, Gran. She's got a woof-woof on her T-shirt. There's a dog on her T-shirt. Woof-woof I Like this. Like this, like this. CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE - How old is he? -17. 18 in December. Tuesday last week he ran away from the children's home. He didn't hand himself in for a week, he did it on Thursday with a lawyer.. Now he's in Nisida. Was he reported when he ran away from the children's home? Yes, they reported it that same morning, Tuesday morning. This is the thing: as regards getting house arrest, obviously, unfortunately, running away isn't a good thing. So he'll never get house arrest? It also depends... I need to interview your brother and find out what he's thinking... because for house arrest... Who do you live with? With my mum. I used to live with my dad, then I met my mum again a long time ago... She wasn't well and I took on a lot of the responsibility at home. In any case, the paperwork that's required... You have to certify that there are no convictions in the family for membership of criminal organisations. - Are there any convictions? - No, not for that. I did three days in Nisida and then got out. My mum plea-bargained. - What did you do? - A fight on the bus. She attacked a plainclothes cop, she didn't know he was a cop. - What kind of assault was it? - She broke his nose. Your mother broke his...? How did she do that? - With a slap. - She hit him. What happened at trial? I never went. Three times, I didn't go. Is this thing ongoing? I don't know, I never took any more interest in it. - Who's working? - Nobody. - Have you got a life of your own? - Every now and then. Every now and then. I haven't had for ten months. My fiancé's under house arrest, but that should end in September. Do you have plans? Are you going to live with your fiancé? I think we'll get married, we've been engaged for ten years. How was it? A bit hot, but intense. Intense? - Better that way, no? - Sure, - References? - One, Name? Amanda Essia. Right, she doesn't have transport, but she wants to work. When have we to contact her? - Tomorrow, - Tomorrow? - Did you say to her it's as a consultant... - Yes, I told her everything. She said if possib... part-time would be better for her because she has a daughter - So part-time? - Yes. - God, it's hot! - It's hot? OK, Salvatore. Come on, we'll have our meeting. Fabio? Two Sky, two disconnections and two NIP. Two NIP and two disconnection. Well done, Fabio, well done. Lino? Three disconnections, two Vodafone and three Sky. Three Sky. Three disconnections, one NIP and a Station. - Three disconnections, one NIP... - One Station. - One Station? - Yes. Will we form a circle, do the shout and all go home, bring this lovely day to a close? That's it. Juice! GEVA.S. juice! Good evening! Bye! You're sweet as sugar You've poisoned my soul You've stopped me living Woman You're worse than a snake You use your angel's face To fool people Woman You're the most beautiful woman I love you and I hate you... A girlfriend? Well, I had one who was called Amalia. I had one... No, no, no... We never saw each other again. Why not? Because before I lived in Giugliano, I was closer to her, now I live in Naples, how can I go and see her? Fourth Floor Adele, this is another of my floors. What did you do before this? Were you always in the hotel? No, I was a housewife before, when I was with my husband, housewife and bringing up my children, then... Here we are. Let's breathe ! It's a nice view from here. Yeah, for those that can enjoy it. What can you do? Resist... Did you go to dance school or was it more something...? - It's something in my DNA. - In your blood, your DNA. Good, you really like it. I go to dance school too, salsa and merengue, to let off steam. I've got bad things inside. As regards this thing about me and my sister, I felt I got less attention, because my sister was a boy, then became a girl. And so, rightly, she got a bit more moral support from my parents than I got. I've always called her Jessica and seen her as my sister. I can't say "my brother" any more, honest. I'm used to it now. I thought she was beautiful the way she was. But she wasn't happy, she did her lips and her breasts twice. Not because she was my sister but I liked her the way she was. It wasn't enough for her and she did more. She likes it 50 it's right she should do it. But I have to say, if I had money to spare, I'd get my tits done as well! We're doing a phone promotion. It's crap! Tele2 is crap ! That's it! Good morning, have you got a phone here? Who's your supplier? - Vodafone. - Vodafone home? Yes. We can give you a new line. All right, guys. - See you about. - Thank you. Good morning! My dear lady! Do you remember me ? - No... - Fabio's mum? - Has he not found a job? - No, he hasn't. He went to sell scarves and caps at a concert, but he didn't sell a thing. He even put in some of his own money. - He didn't earn a thing. - Made a loss, practically. He said he doesn't want to do anything. We're looking for people who want to work. If Fabio is willing, if he's willing to work, I can speak with the boss, Salvatore, and try and fit him in. Enzo, see what you can do, Fabio needs a job. When your children are all right, you know you could even die, but when you see a child drifting like that... even for a headache you get a fright, and say, "What's Fabio going to do?" What happened to him, he's never going to get over it. Even if he tries to hide it, I'm his mum and I understand. What happened to Fabio's brother? One night he went out, said, "See you later," and never came back. The usual persons unknown who go round the streets, indifferent to the value of people's lives. And I lost my son. You ask yourself a thousand questions... if he'd lived, would he maybe be married? Would they have argued over their clothes? You ask yourself these questions, you understand? My goodness. It's just the two of us at home. We're there for each other God help anyone who touches either of us. - How much? - Three euros. Francesco, I've learned about being in and out of shot. If something shouldn't appear on screen, and you can see it, it means it's in shot. When something's out of shot and you should be able to see it, you say, "You're out of shot," and he has to get into shot. If we add the Radicals and the 10 percentage points of those political groups that won't be represented... We'll put another outfit on, then do our face and teeth and hands. Move, that's dirty. - Wait! - It's sore. I'll take it off. Where are we going, love? - Pizza. - Pizza. I mean it, don't forget, tomorrow morning... I won't make any noise, I don't even put the light on. No, if you're sweaty when you get out, put something on. I've got my jacket. You need simple pants under this or you can see the lace. With these shoes... see? I'm comfier in these, they're slippy. We haven't got any hairspray or you could spray that, you put your feet in, it's comfy and it doesn't hurt. That's a trick my mum taught me years ago. But we haven't got any hairspray. Here, Adele, Rosa lent me it, we'll give it back tomorrow. - You got the dummy? Water? - I've got the dummy, water... Have you not got a small bottle? Is this yours? - I'll take it for the baby. - Bye, love. - What's your beloved's name? - Umberto. - Where's he from? - Ponticelli. He's Cristina's brother. How old is he? Same as me. I'll have to tell Dad when I take you home. - It doesn't matter. - You think it's nothing? It's nothing. You making love with him? - Yes. - Yeah? Since when? Not long. What if your father finds out? Does Mum have to go to hospital? It's not like the other time that took so long. Ten minutes, in and out. It takes longer to do the tests. You do this op and you're out. Get off the car! Down, Mario. This is too strong, that's a horrible colour, that's old ladies' make-up, red nail varnish is for whores... ! You're doing my head in! I was jealous of other people looking at you! Really? Instead of being proud of me. Your Mum's got problems and so do you. We can solve them together, but we have to be united. I can't manage it on my own, Tcantry.. How can I? There's hardly any money. Really, I'm trying already. I've only just understood now that I'm a shit, because for four years I didn't know how to love you, I know that now. Because I'm not doing that crap any more. It's a waste of time. And I think I've wasted too much time running after you. You have to behave, especially for your daughter! I'm trying to. I've been trying so hard since you went to work there. You say you're trying because you feel love for me, but I don't feel it for you. Love... I'm going to Nisida. I've got a visit with Antonio. Not yet. I'm outside. They told me the Gucci shoes... they wouldn't let designer shoes in. I hope they let the Gucci shoes in, they've got a strap, no laces. At the last visit, I saw other kids with Dolce & Gabbana shoes and stuff. If they don't let me take them in, I'll bring them back. MINISTRY OF JUSTICE JUVENILE DETENTION CENTRE - Last job? - Brickie. Brickie? Why should we employ you? For my skills... What did you call them? - Communication skills. - Yes. Juice, G.EVAS. juice! Good morning. - Good morning...? - Fabio. - Your surname? - Rippa. Rippa. Good morning, Fabio. This is your first day, you'll go out with Vincenzo. See how it goes, if I've got it right, you met up again after years. - 10 years. - Questions? See you all at 6:30 pm. Watch. Come on, Fabio. Good morning, we're here about your phone, have you got one? - What? - A phone, have you got one? - Yes. - And internet? We're doing a special offer, 60% off your bill. I've just got the phone and now you want to change it again to Tele... what's it called? Infostrada. You said you've got Infostrada. What have we got? Telecom? Alice we've got. What's best to pay? 80 euros every two months or 15 euros a month? - Who's your phone supplier? - Tele2. You're already with us?

Come on, Fabio. Good morning. May I? Is it OK to smoke? How did it go? How is your brother? He's made friends with two or three guys... I gave him some clean stuff, clothes, shoes... food. Your mum? Mum said, if he wants to steal, he has to do it properly. Being a petty thief, 70, 80 euros a time, isn't worth it. -I get it. - That's all. You sound strange, is everything OK? Yeah, everything's fine. Love, it's one thing after another. You under house arrest, Antonio in Nisida, she's the way she is, what the fuck am I meant to do? Enzo! I would suggest you speak a little more... - Slowly? - No, not more slowly. More the way they speak. You shouldn't be too sophisticated, they don't understand anything. - More street? Rougher? - No, not rougher. Use simpler terms that they can understand right away. This is so good, I swear on my mother! My goodness! I want to know how your day went. How is he? Good, I'm happy, if you're happy as well, we can do a second day tomorrow, the trial period is two days. OK. Tomorrow we'll be evaluating you, the other way about. Ma'am... It's about your phone. Good morning, ma'am, we're here about the phone, are you interested? - No, I'm not. - Why not? I'd like to explain about Tele2's offer Who's your provider? - I'm really not interested. - How come? All right, let's go. Pass, pass! Come on, Fabio, let's go. Let's go. Miss, what do you want to do when you grow up? Seeing as you are grown-up, what did you want to be? I've still to decide what I want to do when I grow up. So you're unemployed now? - No, I'm working. - What do you do? - I'm a model! - That's lucky! A model! I wanted to be a footballer, but I don't have what it takes. Why not? Who told you that? - Everyone. - Really? I don't believe it. -I score too many own goals. -Where there's a will, there's a way. Wanting it is half the battle for me. Baby doll... You wanna wake up? We're here. Really? - We're outside your house. - Really? - You fell asleep. - I did. Mum, who is going to get a part-time job with a monthly salary in Naples today? Who? Who? Nobody? They take you all day and shit in your hand at the end of the week. 100 euros a week isn't enough for a mother with a child! I'd rather do 4 hours a day cleaning which comes to more than 600 euros. Four hours, and in the afternoon I can look after my daughter I do the shopping, I cook, I clean... Let me say something. You're always on Facebook. - What's that got to do with...? - Let me finish! Why don't you go on to one of those sites and find a good job? What I want to see is both of you with a more secure future, that's all I'm saying, don't take it the wrong way. I'm not taking it the wrong way, I'm not saying all three of us, but two of us, have these mood swings, so that means we were brought up like that. Emanuele is growing up different to you, the way I want. He studies, doesn't cause me trouble... Why? Why? Because you follow him while you didn't with us! We got home from school and you'd leave. But not with him, you pay attention to him, but not to us, especially not to me. When I came home and said the teacher pulled my hair and I'd kept the hair to show you, other mothers would've caused a rumpus! You never did, not once! Other mothers came along and threw chairs at the teachers! My goodness! I got 160 euros. Can I work for two months to get 160 euros? Yeah, but you have to say as well... you'd come for 10 days and then skip 30. What? What are you saying? They send you to the most godforsaken places around Naples. You've been working there three years and you're still on door to door. Have you noticed they're exploiting you? No, exploiting, no. Enzo, you're too naive. - What time's it? -3:30. - I need to go. -You do? - I need to go to work. - Away and be a slave! - Away and be a slave! - Bye. Away and be a slave! Slave! Whenever you like. Right, this is my father, who accompanies me on the guitar. I'm Enzo and the name of the song is Passione. The further away from me you are The closer I feel you Who knows at this moment What you're thinking of What you're doing You've put a sweet poison Into my veins... Good evening. This is a surprise, good evening. Make a bit of space here. I think about her all the time She is my whole life What a surprise! I'd like to tell her But I can't.. I love her I love her so much Make sure you tell her That I'll never forget her It's a passion That's stronger than a chain That torments my soul And won't let me live, Oh, life My life Oh, heart of this heart You were the first love The first and last you'll be for me Oh, life... - You really don't want to sing? - Oh, Dad, not again. I need to talk to you, because I've met a girl. -A girl? - Yeah. She's Italian, let's say, but it's like... how can I put it? It's like she isn't. Is she or isn't she? She was born in Naples but she's not Neapolitan... - She's Russian? - No. - Polish? - No... - Ukrainian? - No. - What is she? - Nigerian. She's a Nigerian girl. We're going out, we're seeing how things go. If it works... Well, what's the problem? It's not like we're racists! - No, for heaven's sake! - Is she a good girl? - She's a good girl. - It's you that has to like her. Oh, God, these things Do you want to play that game we played as kids? We'd look into each other's eyes. And we mustn't laugh. Right one... Two... Three... Go! I lost! We both lost. Adele... You have to be more patient with your mum. I mean after all... She wasn't a bad mother to us. Dad wasn't there, she had to deal with everything on her own. Above all I should be grateful to Mum. Jessica! Don't cry! Today I've got a job, I work in a bar. And you know it's difficult today... A transsexual... it's not easy for them to find work. I can't say anything else, I'm going to cry. The bells are ringing! I need to go and get married. I'm getting married, I'm getting married! The bells are for my wedding. - Remember that? It was our song. - Yeah! He kills me buried like he is in that way of speaking already with a thousand stories to tell and eyes that might be bluer than the sea who knows if I'm doing the right thing waiting will he notice me? He's too special spend a fortune on his clothes... Dad, can you hear me now? - Can you hear me? - Yes. I dreamt I was in a shop that sells wedding dresses and I was trying on a dress. Everything was fine, then suddenly the police arrived, and wanted to arrest me when I was trying on my wedding dress. Really? Are the police good luck? So it means I'm going to get married? Should I play those numbers? So I've to play wedding dress, police and me? Love! I'll kill you! If you touch him again. I can only tell you one thing... either a singer, or if I'm not lucky, if I don't get anything... I'll do something on the street, what is it you say? Whatever comes along, whatever happens, happens. My dream, the dream I keep in a special drawer is that of appearing on Bravo Bravissimo or the Maurizio Costanzo Show. I'd like to appear there. Hello? Hi, Eva. What's the arrangement for tomorrow night? Listen, Enzo... I'm not really sure this is working. I wouldn't want you to... Just like that? That sudden? You know, I think of you just as a friend, but in saying this to you I don't want us to stop being friends, at least I hope not. But I wanted to see you anyway. No, Enzo, it's best not to. Hello, ma'am, good evening, is Eva in? No, she's not in. And, please, she asked you not to call any more. I understand. I just wanted to tell her one last thing. No, I'm sorry, she's not in. Come on, guys! Let's go with our Napoli scarves! Vamos! Scarves! Hats! Scarves! Scarves! Scarves! Hats! Come on! Vamos! We're playing for the final! Vamos! Scarves! Hats! Come on! Scarves! Hats! It's been such a long time since went to see my father My father is a restorer and, as you can see, he's restoring this piece of furniture. I don't want to do this because there's no money in it... not much anyway. He's got a cough. You giving him something? Syrup. How are you? Not great, so-so. You should look after yourself. You're getting old, look after yourself. And stop smoking, it's bad for you. Yeah, it's bad for me. - How are the children? - They're fine. The girl goes to dance classes. Elisa's boys go to football training. Francesco scored another goal on Saturday. He kills me, thin as a rake, always running, the ball at his feet, shouting at the others for the ball because "I want to score!" He's greedy. Did you come on the scooter? - What about the rain? - It doesn't matter, I get by. In Naples, people say, "Lots of beautiful things". It's a sort of best wishes that can't be translated into dialect. It has to be said in Italian, because beauty is a road that takes you a long way, and it has to be understandable for everyone. Maybe the deepest meaning of that expression is... "I can't tell you bad things won't happen, but I hope the beautiful things outnumber them by far" An Avon lady's job is to show the catalogue, which is our tool, let's say, our window, I say, since we don't sell in shops. This is the catalogue for campaign 8, so you'll start with this catalogue. On the first page, what we have is a launch, in effect, because we always have a launch on the first page, of an exceptional cream Anew which is suggested for ladies of over 40. You have until 28 October to sell the products. It always takes a week, then the products arrive at your house. We can remind the ladies, giving them the bill... That the products... Yes. That the products are coming and she should get the money ready, so she can't say, "I didn't know," "Come back tomorrow or the next day," the usual excuses... No plans yet. Still no plans. Because you make plans and then everything goes wrong. So it's best not to make plans and that way you'll be OK. Tell me about the beautiful things. The beautiful things... Adele has moved to Sicily where she lives with her new partner. Her mother is now in Milan. People say she never fell in love Some say she had a boy in her heart One evening She gave him her heart and her life And then in silence nobody ever knew... Fabio still lives with his mother. He is on a trial period in a factory that makes wallets. His girlfriend is pregnant. She'll be in America And won't "speaka" Italian any more Or maybe she's sleeping In the underground She'll be singing an American song... Silvana has fallen out with her mother again. Now she lives in the old part of the city with a new partner who works for a cleaning company. Enzo lost his job and is still unemployed. His father too, for health reasons, has had to give up busking. THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS - No, no, say the title. - The Further Away You Are. And then begin. - Is that all right? - Go. - The Further Away You Are. - Look at the camera, serious face. - What... again? - Look at the camera and start again. The Further Away You Are.
