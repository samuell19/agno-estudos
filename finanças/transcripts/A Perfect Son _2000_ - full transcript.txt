♪♪♪ (phone beeping) (sigh) - Hello? I have a body for you to pick up. But I don't know where to begin. - It's been a while, hasn't it? - I thought you gave up on me. - Well. Last chance to pay your respects. And you're on time. I'm impressed. Still smoking? - Yeah. - Come on, then. - (quietly): Shouldn't we be crying or something? You're praying? - What does it look like? - It doesn't work, trust me. I've tried. - Maybe you should consult the manual. - Too much sex and violence for me. Nice job. (rattling) - What are you doing? - Want to make sure he's in there. - Are you sure you're not on something? - I bet he doesn't burn. (short exhale) (door opening and closing) - Hello, John. - Hi, how are you? - It's good to see you again. Thank you for coming. This is my little brother, Theo. - John. Pleased to meet you, Theo. I'm sorry about your father. He was a special person. The funeral was very moving. I took the liberty of choosing a brief passage. I hope that's alright. - Of course, thanks. - Let's join together. (church bells ringing) - I know it's not the right time to say this, but it's not like he cared about anyone else. We reap what we sow. - He wasn't that bad. - He was a dick. - He wanted you to have this. - Yeah, nice watch. Keep it. What'd you get? The house? Car, maybe? Stocks? - Bills. For specialists in the States, private nurses, experimental therapies... we tried everything. - Oh, aren't you just the perfect son, huh? - Well, we agree on something. It's over here. It's nice to think they'll finally be together again. - Why? - You know, it's been a drag doing this all by myself. Why can't you be more responsible? - Why can't you be more of a fuckup? - So I can check into a detox centre every time somebody important in my life actually needs me? - You think what you want to think. - I was hoping you'd changed. - I was hoping you'd changed, too. See you later. (grunt) (clattering) (throat clearing) (sigh) This is the way it feels to calm myself.

Friday: desperately missing rehab. I don't... I have no... It's lonely outside. But, um, my feeling is... I caught myself wondering if all this is worthwhile. - ...got to ask you, is... - Would I hire me? Oh, yeah. I'm a good typer. - A good typist. - Yeah, right.

I've never counted. - 30? That's impressive. - You? - I've slept with a few more guys than that. - How many more? - Hundreds more. (beeping) Drug time. We have to talk about the future. I know it's not your favourite subject and, uh... frankly, it's lost a lot of its charm for me, too. But when I'm dead and gone, I want you to know what to do. You may want to annotate your copy, just to keep this stuff straight. Or, you can take separate notes. Now, first, I don't want a funeral. I want a memorial service and some kind of a viewing. Just let people know about it. And don't spend too much on the casket. I want to be dressed in one of my lawyer suits. That's the way I spend most of my professional life, that's the way I want to be remembered. Put a notice in all four newspapers. Hey! If you write the obit, at least you'll get something published. - Wow... yeah. - Next, cremation. I want my ashes split into three equal parts. Now, there may not be much there, so you're going to have to be frugal. The first third I want you to sprinkle around my garden, to help the flowers bloom -- especially the pink ones. Next, toss a handful into the showers at the Central Y. - I'm not going to the fuckin' YMCA. Come on. - Just pitch it in and back out. No one will touch you if you don't look interested. And the last third I want buried in the new plot I bought for me and you, next to Mom and Dad. - Don't you have some friends who could do a better job of this than me? - I want you to be able to get on with your life. - I don't know, Ryan. I don't know if I can do this. - OK. I need you. - What about when I needed you? - What do I have to say to you? (smack) Smarten up. - Everything OK? - Great. I'm dying, Theo. Really dying. Lunch is on me. I'll see you later. (indistinct exchanges) Ciao. - OK. Bye. (door chime) (door shutting) (sigh) (soft music begins) - Theo? - Hi. - I didn't hear you knock. - I didn't. - So you're just walking up and down my hallway? - I don't know what I'm doing. - You look a lot better than the last time I saw you. - Sorry. - So, uh, what's going on? - I don't know.

I shouldn't have slept with you when you got back. I don't know what got into me. I thought things could be different. Truth is, I knew it was over a long time ago. We're really different, you and I. - I don't agree. You wanted what I wanted. - Look, I had a really shitty day. I don't want to judge you. I just wish we'd been more careful. - What? - It's yours. It's really shitty, I know. That's what I've been dealing with this week. - You weren't gonna tell me? - It's a fucking mistake. - What do you mean? - I was stupid. Of all people, you'd think this wouldn't have happened to me, but it did. (snort) Anyway, I booked the abortion, so it'll all be over in a month. - Why didn't you tell me? - Come on, Theo. Get real. You want to have a kid? With me? - I don't know what the fuck I want. - Well, that's the problem. I do. (door shutting) - So this is my life, by my own design. And it's just an impression.

That the best you can do? - You wouldn't understand, so don't try. - No wonder you've never had a relationship. - (scoffing): I've had a relationship. Wild man named Patrice, in Montreal. We were together for six months. He was a fabulous guy. That's when I found out I was positive. I had to tell him. We cried all that night, then he left. I told him to leave. That's when I came home.

(quietly): I saw your brother's name on the list. He's stable. I just talked to the doctor who treated him. He was beaten pretty badly, but he's not going to die, Theo. Not from what happened. It was good you got him here. - He was bleeding... I, I didn't even think about it. - Let me see? No cuts or anything, that's good. You better get a blood test, just to make sure. Why didn't you tell me he was sick? - Hey, you're finally out of bed. - (chuckling): Just don't ask me how I'm doing. - I'm not making any promises. - They tell me I can go home whenever I want. - That's good, isn't it? How do you feel? - Two weeks in this place would make anybody sick. Dying at home's a lot better than dying here. Mind you, I've been down this road so many times with other people. The whole homecare thing is just such a hassle. Calling friends, booking schedules, ordering medical supplies... It's just such a nightmare. I don't know if I'm up to it. - I can help. - What do you know? I'll get you a list of people to call. - OK. - It's good you don't know what you're getting into. Let me introduce you to some of my friends on the ward. Must be out playing volleyball. This is Peter. I know it's a terrible thing to say, but... it's comforting to know there's somebody actually sicker than I am. You know, when Dad was dying, he was frightened most of the time. I thought about telling him about what was happening to me, but I didn't think he could face it. I... I thought he was weak, you know? But now that I'm dying, I don't know that I can face it, either. What about you, Theo? (sigh) Can you give me a hand, here? With this? - Yeah. - Hold on a second. OK. Ooh, you're warm. - What do you want me to do with this? - You can just throw it on the bed, there, thanks. (small groan) It's good to see you. (stifled crying) - Hi. I'm Theo. - The long-lost little brother. I'm Laurie. (loud sigh) I heard lots about you, Theo. - I see you two have met. - Well, we were just getting acquainted. - You guys are high. (giggling) - You haven't told me he was so beautiful. - He's kind of cute. - You guys old friends? - Well, only if you count the last 20 years. I've been locked up tight in your brother's rather complicated fag closet, I'm afraid. - You guys were together? - Oh, Theo. Not in a million years. - We're more like family. I'm the fairy godmother and he's the big, bad wolf. Oh... I guess you didn't know your brother was into leather and chaps and whips, freaky shit like that. Well, not the kind of thing that guys like us would be into. - You're into leather? - He's exaggerating. - Ever been attracted to another man, Theo? What? We can keep a secret. - Sure. - Oh? Who? - Elvis. - What is it with straight men and Elvis? The man was a pig. - Stop corrupting him. He wants to be normal. - You don't want to be normal, do you? Please don't be normal. Well, this ends my shift. - Ciao. - Nice to meet you. - Take care of your brother, OK, Theo? - You're hilarious. (whirring and gurgling) - Hey, stranger. You did a good job setting all this up. It's actually working. - It was easy; everyone wanted to help. - Amazing, huh? What are you writing there? - Nothing. - Want to read it to me? - No. - Why did you write it, if you are not going to read it? - It's a lousy poem. - Fags love poetry. I'd like to hear it. - Since when? - Since now. - You don't know what you're getting yourself into. (throat clearing) (paper rustling) "Faith, sorrow, longing fade. "This dawn is soft, another day's begun. "But each gesture and moment remain, though time moves like a dream. "These are eternal nights. "Only shapes and shadows, "like soul and body have no end. "This fleeting world is not enough. But to me, finally beautiful." - That's nice. (deep breath) So you think you'll ever make anything of your writing? - Thought I just did. - It's infusion time again. I think I should show you how to set all this stuff up. There's a watch over in the drawer, there. You want to get it, please? Dad got it from his dad. - It's nice. - Yeah. Alright, first things first. Sterilize this end. It's tricky, but... stick it in. Once you're in, I'll open the valve. OK, hang on, and then I'll say "go." Go ahead, right down-- - All of it? - Down to 1 mil. - Does it matter how fast I go? - No. Alright, we close it... OK. Now, one of these. Sterilize that. Why don't you go ahead? - Yeah. - Stick that sucker in. - I feel like an old pro. (click) - "Click." Now we turn everything on. This one, this one, this one, this one, and that's the last one. Alright, go ahead. 7 drips every 10 seconds-- Whoa! I'm drowning. OK. Seven. There you go. Little fast. - (Sarah): So, you must be relieved. - Never has the word "negative" been so positive. - At least the antibodies aren't showing up right now. We'll still have to test you again in a month or two, just to confirm the result. No unsafe sex in the meantime. - Yes, doctor. - How's your brother doing? - He's amazing. - He's lucky to have you. Come here. I, uh... I wanted to make sure you'd be here, so I could ask you something face-to-face. I've been thinking. I don't want to have to do this alone. I want you to come with me, to the abortion. - Yeah. I'd like to. - OK. (elevator opening) (deep breath) (shaky sigh) (beep) (banging) (gasp) (retching) (dry coughing) - I'm outside. I don't know what to do. Ryan! Answer me! You OK? - I'm just grand. - Do you want a doctor? - Oh, no. I'll be up like this another six times before morning. (water running) (crash) (cry) Dramatic entrance. I'm touched. Just help me up. - C'mere. - Do I still look OK? - You're fucking gorgeous. (cough) - (whispering): Thanks. - I'm going to go, uh, I'm going to go clean up the bathroom. Why don't you get some sleep? - Why? How about nightmares, nausea, fear, panic... - I didn't mean... - I know. Could you get me another Gravol? I got another bottle in the bathhouse-- bathroom. - You got a one-track mind. - Thanks. (hoarse cough) (distant cough) - I didn't know which one it was, so I brought a selection. - (laughing): Phew. - You got some pretty good drugs in there. - Yeah, I've done them all. - Yeah, me too. - This is the one. Death watch is a barrel of laughs, isn't it? - Time of my life. - I'm scared, Theo. I'm really scared. I feel awful all the time. (sobbing): I don't know what's going to happen to me. I don't want to die. (weeping) I've just spent so much time hating myself. - Me too. (heavy breathing) - I'm OK now. Ugh. Why don't you go back and get some sleep? - OK. - Theo? Please stay. - I'll be back in a minute. (whimpering) I got something here. - Ah! - "In all England..." - Wuthering Heights. That was Mother's favourite. Dad always said it was her story. "...I do not believe that I could have fixed "on a situation so completely removed "from the stir of society. "A perfect misanthropist's heaven: "and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair "to divide the desolation between us. "A capital fellow.

(door opening) - Sarah Parker? - You gonna wish me good luck? - (whispering): Yeah. Sarah. Don't do it. - What? - Please don't do it. - What are you talking about-- - I don't want you to go through with it. - What are you saying? - Have the baby. - Selfish bastard. - When I was in rehab, they told us to focus on something we cared about, because you had to have a reason to want to get better. You were my reason. You were my reason. - It better not be a fucking boy. - "Pas plus que son destin, son devoir n'est écrit nulle part." Let me translate. "Man finally knows --" and woman, I'm sure he meant to say -- (crowd laughing) "that he is alone "in an indifferent universe, "out of which he emerged by chance.

Promise me you'll go through this shit sometime, alright? - I think I'm in love with Sarah. - Congratulations. - We're going to have a baby. - Baby? - Yeah. - I'm happy for you. - Ryan, wait a minute. (sigh) - I don't want to think about things I'm never going to see. I'm sad, Theo, and empty. I'm sick and I'm exhausted and I don't want to go on. Can you understand that? Forgive me if I'm not up to saying, "Way to go!" What do you want from me? - I don't know. - Well, leave me alone. I mean, what ever made you think you could be a father, anyway? - You did. ♪♪♪ (birds chirping) (keys tapping) - Theo? Did you get that Gatorade? Could you bring one up? I'm dying of thirst up here.

Look, you probably know I'm a resident at St. Pat's, so if you have trouble getting anything, I'd be happy to try to help. - Thanks. Aren't you a little young to be a doctor? - That's because I'm not one. At least, not yet.
