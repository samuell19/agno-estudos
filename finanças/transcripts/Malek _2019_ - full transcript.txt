- My money. - Okay okay. - My money! - How are you! Come with me. Ah! Oh... Come on, give me my money. Yeah. I had it, your money. Well, I don't have it anymore. Damn, but it's not possible! Come on, come on, come on. It's your boyfriend? Who, Faroud? He thinks you're my lover. This is exactly what I need. What's your name? Shoreh. And you? - Malek. - Pleased, Malek. Give me your number. No, I'm not going to give it to you. But on the other hand, I don't mind if you manage to find it. It's more romantic, right? The girl I was talking to, there, "Soreh"... - Shoreh. - Shoria? - Shoreh. - Shoral. You know her? Yeah, yeah, it's like my sister. - It's like your sister... - What? Well, why did you never tell me about her? Why would I tell you about her? - Give me his number. - No no. You, all you want is to fuck her. She's not a girl like that. I have to protect her from filthy Arabs like you. Ha! Please give me his number. - No, manage. - For what? You like her? Oh, I just told you that's like my sister. Maestro Reza, even the little sisters, they have needs. Needs? Hey, I forbid you to see her. You understood? Otherwise... I'm going to tell him how you are a motherfucker. - Given. - No. - "Shoral". - Yeah, that's it. It can't happen like that every time we meet. If you don't talk today, you're going to have to go back to the hospital. Any regrets for surviving? No. It's just a failure. Was your suicide attempt a failure? Let's say that before, I... I wouldn't have missed my shot. Before what? In Lebanon, before, that's it. I wouldn't have missed my shot. I was more... more brutal. There you have it. And why brutal? It's cultural. It's different from here. Over there, you can shout from one balcony to another, insult your neighbour's mother, that's no problem. You can hit a child if he makes too much noise. Indeed, that, here, is not very well seen. But we'll come back to what you did. Why did you want to die? Damn... I dunno. I dunno. I was... depressed by winter, by... by the cold. I'm walking down the street, not a... not a smile, nobody looks at each other. I don't know that myself. I don't know, I was wondering what the hell I was doing here, what was this country... Then I had... I had nothing to eat. Nothing in the pockets... nobody. Is that worse than the cold? Are there things on your mind right now? Find money to eat. Do you have social assistance? Yes. Do you have close friends? No, I don't have any close friends. I wonder about your physical health. I am very well thank you. Are you taking drugs? No. I don't take drugs. Your mother, how was she? That's it, are we coming? Talking about his mother, right? It's a psych thing. Trust me. Your mother, how was she? She was brunette. All right. Do you talk to him often? She is dead. Recently? No, some time ago. Did you feel pain? No, not really, no. Do you cry sometimes? No. - Did you like him? - Yeah. Yeah, I loved him. Even when she told us she was going to leave us. And why did she want to leave? Because my father didn't give him enough money for food, for life. So she threw the money at him and told him that... he just had to feed us... ours... the retarded. Did your father hit her? Yeah. Was it violent? There was the war, too. That's for sure. But at home, was it violent? I don't know, I only knew that. My grandfather hit my grandmother, and then so on. How did you feel to witness all this? What did it make me... What do you want me to tell you? Me, I was small, I was waiting for it to pass. So. If I tell you to think of a happy memory with your mother, what do you think about? To nothing. I do not have. Frankly, between us, if you let me go smoke a little cigarette in the park, I will talk to the squirrels. And then, hopefully, I'll come back with some great stories I can tell you. We do that? We will stop here for today. What do you expect from our meetings? Me nothing. It is... It is the court, which obliges me to come. I wouldn't be here otherwise. Are you going to come back anyway? I do not have the choice. I have the impression that we're going to have to talk about your sister soon. What are you doing here? SO... Souad... No, no, no, no. No no no. What do you want to talk about? I'd rather talk about your eyes. Your legs, too. The way you look at me. That's to say? You know very well. Come join me. That wouldn't be very therapeutic. Hmm. The body of a woman against me, I find that... that is very therapeutic. You know, I've slept with a lot of women. I imagine. On the other hand, happy women, me, it... this makes me uneasy. Hmm. And Shoreh... With the life you have, do you really think she's going to be interested in you? I dunno. I'll make it right, I... I will find a job... Yeah, I'll find a job. So you really like her? Yes. Is she the kind of girl you would give flowers to? Like yours. So everything's OK. Ah, so it's Faroud, the traitor? I thought it was Reza. Reza, you speak. He didn't even want to give me your number, he kept telling me that you were... that you weren't cut out for me, that you were a bit like his little sister. His little sister? It's not true. He wanted so much to sleep with me, that for weeks he asked me - to marry her. - Serious? Pfft! Iranians... they're all mama's boys. All they want is a meal on the table and a tidy house. At least you're not like that. No. No, me, I... Me, I'm content with love - and fresh water. - Yeah... I will sleep with you. But on one condition. You have to promise me to tell Reza everything. Uh... Why? Reza and his friends will think that I am with you and they will stop harassing me. I really like the idea. Perfect. I swear to you that tomorrow, I will tell everything to Reza. The details too. You will tell him how I invited you into my mouth... and how I closed my eyes submissively. I believe you are going to lose a friend. He's touchy, Reza. Oh. I do not care, he's not really my friend. We pretend. He likes you, do you think? Either way, he won't want to see you anymore. Ah well I have to see it, because he owes me money. He lost his job, so I have to wait. Ah good? Me, I learned that he had found a new one in a restaurant. At the Star of Persia. It's true? Yeah. It was Faroud who told me. Oh, fucking liar. Nice shirt. Ah, you'd better go away. Pay me and I'm leaving. - A Coke, please. - I thought that you didn't have a circle. It's Shoreh - who lent me money. - Shoreh? Hmm-hmm. I fell in love with her. Lover? Stop, love, you don't even know what it is. Well, anyway, I fucked her. Did you sleep with her? Yes my friend. So what? You're so shit it comes out of your mouth. She insisted. But how did you do it? Nothing, I invited her for a coffee, and then, we went to her house. What do you want what am I telling you? You are hot Iranians. Pff, you annoy me with your pretty face, there. Why didn't you tell me you were in love with her? Never... never... I would have thought that she would go with you. When you are nothing. Look at you, damn. THANKS... In any case, if it can reassure you, we talked about you. - Oh yeah? - Hmm-hmm. She made me promise to tell you how I made love to her. Slowly. So, I'll tell you. Are you a mythomaniac too? A nice Iranian like her? Take. Kind Iranian. Disgusting, there. No no no no no. I promised her to tell you everything, then you will listen to me. No, you're stupid, you're not telling me anything, get out. You don't want me to tell you? Pay me. Pay me and I'm leaving. As soon as they give me my stamp, I will pay you. Now get out. Excuse me, can I ask you a question? I would like to know if you are looking for someone to work with. You have experience, at least? Of course, I have already been a waiter. I can't believe you asked my boss for a job. Wait until I tell him how much of a bastard you are. Listen to me: the only scoundrel here is you. I have to move to get my money back. Given. It's 40. Damn, give me that. See you Friday. See you Friday, sir. Amazing. To Reza. I like him, deep down. He didn't want me badly. No. He was just in love. He's gonna let go of me now. GOOD. Come. Do you know what we are going to do, Faroud and I? - No. - We are going to see you at the restaurant. I will go one evening when Raza is playing. And I will listen to it while watching you spill your tray on your poor customers. Come when you want. How beautiful you are tonight, Malek. Come on, let's dance. Tonight, I'm leading. Good morning. THANKS. I stole them for you. It's interesting. Sit down. OK, okay, I understand. It's good to talk about the past, but I don't see the point right now for me. I live my life, everything is fine, thank you. Hmm. I understand, but you still attempted suicide. Together, we try to see why. Back to your sister. Why do you insist? I'm telling you that I'm fine. I understand for your patients; they feel bad, they argue with you, and then it gets better. But I'm fine already. Yes, right now. Well what, you have to live in the present moment. No? What do you actually want? You want drama, right? That I tell you horrible stories? I don't see the point. Go ahead, I'm listening. OK. Well, I'll tell you the story of... of the marriage of my sister and my brother-in-law. That will interest you. Your sister, is she still with him? No. What is she doing now? She works in a shop. In Liban? Yeah, in Lebanon. And Tony? I dunno. His weapon, did he always carry it on him? He was a militiaman. All right? It was normal. She met him like that, everyone has a gun. Everyone here is against guns. You make me laugh. It's different there. To have a weapon is to be someone, it is to be able to obtain things, to defend something. We do not have a choice. Pacifism is a luxury. What do you want to say? You are safe here. No? You are far from everything, you can be nice, cultured, you are protected by seals, by the oceans, by the meadows... By the mountains. And...? And you can be a pacifist. That's all. It's a good job. Eh? You are happy, right? Nice house, a well stocked fridge with fruits, vegetables and all that. I am wrong? There are many people who were born here, poor, and who do not have a weapon at home. Yes, that is democracy. Democratic countries are less violent, but more hypocritical. The West is very happy to sell its weapons. It makes the economy prosper. It is true that it is hypocritical. And you, a weapon, did you have one? No, I didn't have one, but I managed to find one. It's not complicated. - And here? - What? Do you have a gun? You really believe that if I had had a weapon here, I would have taken the lead in finding a branch and a rope on Mount Royal? But don't you think it's better that way? No? Yeah, sure. I have an appointment with the boss. - He's coming. - Oh. It's your father? Yeah. How do you know? Ah, I know some things. There, for example, I know that there, right away, you would rather be somewhere else. Where? Chilling with your friends. Eh? Me, I love it, hanging out. Me too. Do you want to hang out together? I'm joking. My father is coming. Go away. It's good! You are already there. - Mr. Shahid, welcome. - THANKS! Hello, Mr. Shahid. Here is the menu of the day. Thank you, huh! Who was it? A friend. A friend? - You two were only? - Yeah. Nice bottle, huh. What's he got to look at here? Looks like... that he is going to recite a poem. Yeah. It could be a poet. Let's go. Come on, come on! Come. You're going to take that in your face! - Cowardly! Cowardly! - Take! Ah! Ah! Oh, you're mean! Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stopped. Stopped. Stop, stop, stop, I can't breathe. Stop, let me go! Get off me, bastard, get off me! Are you leaving me here? When I tell you to let go, you let me go! Shoreh! Shoreh! She's disturbed, that girl. No, she had been drinking. Yes, but she has problems. So what, she has no right? No, you don't have any problems. You are too naive, too innocent. What makes you think that? It shows. Look at you there. You had a quiet childhood. Yeah... With Christmas, with the lights, snowballs... The little yellow bus that picked you up at school. That's it? Private school? Eh? Petty bourgeois? Eh? You speak... What's the difference? It only changes when the worst criminal act we have done in his life, it's smoking in secret, we remain innocent. Whore... Do you still smoke? If there is a cigarette for me, yeah, I smoke it. I'm talking about drugs. Your analyzes show that you consume. No, I can't afford that. If there's a joint, yeah, I shoot it, and if there's a coke line, I take it. What is the problem? You still have to be careful. Hard drugs can cause periods of hallucinations and delirium. But when we first met, you told me you didn't take drugs. I don't know, I don't remember. Maybe. I wrote it down here. So there, you are telling me no; here, you tell me yes. Is it true what you are telling me? Yeah, it's all true. How do I know? I was stressed. It's the first time, it's normal. I... So. And now it's better. OK. At work, how are you? Yeah. The food is good, it's free. Have you seen your girlfriend? Hmm. Yeah. How's it going? GOOD. We will resume with your sister and then her husband. I don't know where I was. You said that your brother-in-law forced the priest to marry them. Afterwards, she got pregnant. One day she came home bleeding and... he had smashed it. She hurt all over. I started washing her face and she started crying. All right... I had no weapon, so, suddenly, I went directly to see a bororo. I asked him for a gun. - Who is a bororo? - He's the neighborhood thief. The one I used to fly with when I was little. I told you, I was going through the windows and all that. - No. - I never spoke to you of a bororo? But yes, I already told you about it. No. Maybe drugs are confusing you. No. OK, so you went to see the neighborhood thief. Yeah. He said he could get me one, but... I had to do him a little favor, if you know what I mean. Flight? A little more serious. Brief... He showed me a handful of blank checks, and... he could not read, nor write. I asked him who it was, he told me it was the priest. His plan worked? Hmm. I backdated the checks. He had found a paper with the priest's signature. It was easy to imitate. He wanted to cash them before the account was closed. Have you ever been caught? No. And your weapon, did you have it? Hmm. Yes. Did you use it? Shortly after, my sister, she came to the house. She came to take refuge with her baby. I'm tired here. I can enter? Yes go on. Good, you're alive. You forgot that. THANKS. Between. Sit down. Didn't that hurt you too much? Don't worry, I've had worse. Why weren't you answering the phone? I was busy. With your poet? He is a taxi driver and his name is Majid. He was my father's best friend. After the revolution, they launched an underground newspaper. Socialist, intellectual... The mullahs arrested my father and tortured him. But he never gave Majid's name. They murdered him. Majid managed to escape and he ended up here, in Montreal. A few years later, it was I who had to leave the country. And I contacted him. So. You're happy? I'm glad to be with you, yeah. Take me in Your arms. Malek? Could you please bring me some dessert. Yes with pleasure. Take. THANKS. Your homework. I take care of them. Welcome. How are you? THANKS. - Yeah. - I installed you a small table facing the sea. Go ahead. Wow! Hold. - THANKS. Sir's? - But of course. Mr. waiter, where is the menu? Sit down quietly... And Mr. waiter, the toilets, where are they? This way, miss. Just down the stairs. What are you doing here? Wasn't that an invitation? No. No way. Come on. Go to work. Go ahead. Hey! Hey! Malek, this man, do you know who he is? Eh? - No. - Tell me, do you know him? - Who? - Let's go. Come with me. - You do not know him? - Come, I tell you. But who? He beat her again? Two weeks later, when I got back to my parents... I heard my sister's baby cry. Did your sister know about the plan? No. Carry on. I'll tell you the rest, but afterwards, if you have nothing to say to me, I will never set foot here again. One day, I had an appointment with my sister at the store. When I arrived, she wasn't there. They say Tony came to get her and that... it... went... badly. And I understood. I couldn't shoot. I was unable. Did you regret it? My sister, she died because I was a coward. Because I wanted to make some money. Because I wanted to leave this country. And now I am here. Malek? You left too quickly. The hardest thing is done. You got to say it. But you just have to understand that what happened is over. There's a new life for you here. Do you really believe what you say? But we have to keep going. I think we're both wasting our time. It's weird, the two of us here in this country. What happened last week at the restaurant? Is it because of the old man there, who ate all alone at his table? Hmm? Tell me. He knew you? If he comes back to the restaurant, you have to call me. Do you know where he lives? No. Can you find out? Yes why? He was the guard of my prison in Iran. They came to my house when I was 18. They told my mother they would keep me for 3 hours, and kept me for 3 months. And he raped me I don't even know how many times. I swore to myself that if I ever saw him again, I was going to kill him. And he is there. Doesn't that shock you? Nothing human shocks me. I'm going to kill him. You want to help me? Yes. You say yes like that... Have you ever killed someone? No. But I could have. Who? My brother-in-law. He murdered my sister. I could have killed him, but I didn't. If you had another chance to kill him, would you do it? I dunno. Maybe. I need a gun. I can ask Majid that, but I'll tell him it's for you. You will go find her. All right. I need to be alone here. Malek? Yeah? Who is the girl who came the other day? Shoreh? For what? - She's coming back? - Maybe. Yeah. How do you find her? Very pretty. I only know pretty girls. Tell me, I have a question for you: who is the gentleman who came last time, with his bodyguard? Mr. Shahid? Yes. He's very rich. He works for the government. - Canadian? - But no, silly. Iranian. What does he do? He sells, he buys. But my father can't tell me what. Ah... It's a secret. Just ask him. He is coming tomorrow. You have your gun. Give me that. What's wrong or what? It's for you? No. It's not for me, it's for a friend. You're sure? Yes, I'm sure, I just told you, it's for a friend! Anyway, you think I'm crazy. No. I think you need help. Hmm-hmm? Liar. You want to send me to the hospital. With that, you're not going to the hospital, In any case. Do you think that if I had killed him, the other... Tony... Would my life be... How do you say here? More serene? I dunno. We wouldn't be here to talk about it, anyway. If we had been in another life, well, we could have been together. I would have liked that. I wish I was with a woman like you. You love it? Yes. Very nice piece. Shahid will be delighted. It's me. It's confirmed, he's coming tonight. OK. Good evening dear friend! It's my girlfriend, she forgot something.
