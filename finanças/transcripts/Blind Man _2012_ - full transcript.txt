Would you come in? I don't trust it Okay - I'll look upstairs - Thank you - It's fine, there is no one. - Please No, thank you 10 seconds. This had better be important I'll be there in an hour On the window, there is not splatter but stripes... and sort of abstract drawings, made with the limbs of the victim. There is Blood Type O+ on the ground, the bar and the walls. The victim was cut up at the bar into fifteen pieces. Her limbs were sawn into thirds and she was decapitated. It could have a meaning. A 'signature' or a ritual. Two glasses of white wine. The second possibly from the killer. - This is a crime scene, not a circus. I want just my own people in here. The others have 30 seconds to leave. - Commander? - Héloïse - Simon, not now, please. Wait. Thank you. I'm listening, Héloïse. There is not much to tell yet. We're still picking up the pieces. Yes... of course - The security camera in the hall? - We have the recording, but it hasn't worked for two days - What day is it? - Monday. No, wait, now it's Tuesday. - What's up there? - It's the bedroom. - The victim? - Isabelle Royer, 33, unmarried, and cultural advisor. - Cultural advisor. - It's important, culture. Ah yes. - Any signs of forced entry? - None. Vermulen is interrogating the neighbors. Marchand and Briand are also on it. We are checking fingerprints. We'll find nothing. - Why do you say that? You can expect anything with psychopaths, right? I don't know if he is a psychopath, but he is surely a professional. No forced entry, surveillence camera broken 48 hours before the crime... ...before the week-end, to ensure it cannot be repaired. He planned his coup. He hid, he waited and he killed. Then he cut her into pieces. He knew what he was doing. He knew. He must be very disturbed. - And did not want this to go unnoticed. - Tell everyone on the surveillence cameras to get recordings for one month preceding the crime. - Yes. - Where are you going? - To have a shower. You want the details? - How long? - I worked for her for 10 days. - How did she contact you? - Directly. Since I started driving, there was a lot of work at the Ministry. In the 10 days you knew Isabelle Royer, did you notice anything you thought strange? She was nervous. Very nervous. - She kept trying to ring someone, and it wasn't answered. - Do you know who she rang? - No, but it drove her crazy. She insisted I examine her apartment almost every night before she slept. - She was afraid. - What was she afraid of? Her ex. I never met him. - Warnas - Matthieu Warnas? - Do you know him? - He's been hospitalized. - Do you know the reason? - No, not yet. - Are you waiting for an invitation? - And last night, you searched the apartment? - Yes. You're sure there was no one? Think before answering. You worked for a paranoid who wanted you to check her room every night. I understand that you can get tired of it. But if I find out that the killer was at her place while you deny it I will see that as a violation of your professional duty. Worse, as evidence of complicity. Unless you change your statement. - It was already late. I realized I could not stay. She was too eager for me to stay. - How flattering. - Nobody else had something to gain. - I am not like that - No, you only do your work - If there was someone hidden, I never saw. - I didn't have a chance to look. - You just didn't look. I'm sure Isabelle Royer would gladly accept your excuses but she's been cut up. - How so? - In 15 pieces. With a saw. - Would you like to see? I've taken a deposition from the neighbor on the third floor. - The one who beat his wife. - What does his wife say? She says it was a year ago, and after after two complaints over three months. - I'll see her tomorrow - Anything else? - Nothing important, besides Warnas. - Matthieu Warnas, photographer, painter, artist. Well qualified, but that didn't prevent two stints in jail. It was a drug rap, nothing like this. It doesn't make him a psychopath. There is also the hospital evidence. According to medical records, he is paranoid and hallucinates. - You are sure this is the address? - Yes, but I have not called ahead. - Why not? - I don't know, for the surprise. I don't like surprises. Yes? Hello Warnas, it's Lassalle. Do you remember me? - The cop? - Good! Your memory is not fried, despite what you inhale. I don't want to bother you but I need to verify your address. Are you at 10 rue Bouve? The grey door? Why are you asking this? Because I need to ask a few questions. We could do this by phone, but... face to face is better, isn't it? One to one? Or we can go down to police headquarters. Thursday or Friday? Which is better? No, the phone will be fine. Do you know a certain Isabelle Royer? You hesitate, mmm? Answer my question I wouldn't deny it It would mean you're lying to me. I already don't trust you, and it'll make me come looking. - Is that what you want? - Wait, I haven't say anything yet Well hurry up, I have other things to do - OK... I know her. When was the last time you saw her? Warnas, I'm talking to you! - What do you want from me? - Just answer me. My job is to ask the questions your job is to answer them because you do not want problems Answer me When did you see her the last time? I'm going to say nothing because I want nothing to do with it. Is that clear? Don't worry. It's because she is dead. What are you doing? Hey, listen to me This way is cut off. Don't move! Go ahead and shoot! - Nice place you've got here Go ahead, shoot! Who's not moving now? You think you could come into my business, just like this? Héloïse, could you go outside and wait please? No, you stay here. Stay and put your gun down. Gun on the floor, I said! Keep your weapon and do as I say. Say here! Come back! Come back here, you bitch! I said come back! - And close the door - I told her to stay, that bitch! What can we do. This is the modern woman. They have their own heads. If you try anything, I'll blow it. Do you understand? - Could you explain it because I'm tired - None of this matters, he's a cop. You sold me out! Are you Narcotics? I want to stay in this business! I don't hear anything. Is everything OK? It's fine, Héloïse, it's fine. Send your whore away from the door. Or I'll blow everything! First, she's not a whore. She's a fantastic girl who does her job. Repeat. Repeat! She's a fantastic girl who does her job Now listen to me well. You will choose from these two options: The first: I fire a bullet in your head, take the grenade that will explode in 7 seconds and throw it out the window into the courtyard The second: You open your hand and I take the grenade You'll have 7 seconds to get away because today I'm in a good mood and I do not care about your fucking business. Héloïse! Take care of the moron! You, keep this. What is it? He's entering the factory. She hired a bodyguard because she was afraid. She was brutally killed, Warnas She was cut into pieces. Not a pretty sight, ever. Stop Please stop. We loved... We sincerely loved.. At first you mourn all the time But after a few weeks, it will lessen. You'll see. That is the worst of it. After a time, you resign... but you don't forget anything It just gets easier, that's all This is the problem: you're not really sure you want the pain to leave - It's complicated - She was never afraid of me If you say she was, it's because she was afraid to tell the truth - What is the truth? - I don't know anything It's true she was afraid, but it had nothing to do with me It was because of my job, she told me What exactly is your job? Why should I be the only suspect? She dated three men. That's no reason to kill her. - I didn't kill her! - I didn't say you killed her I said that there wasn't sufficient reason to do it You try to follow me but we never get there. Yeah keep talking like I'm crazy... after my commitment to the psychiatric hospital... But you.. You never go crazy At least once a day And I have depression. Can you imagine? Life is fucked, no? I cheated They made me suffer They told me, but I refused. Then they followed me. They took photos... of everything I promise to tell the truth Maybe it was one of those bastards that did it - Don't let him go, ok? - I'm watching. I didn't say to watch him, like it's a joke. - I should stay here. That's it. Stay right beside him, that's all And don't let go? Yes, don't let go. Something to do, go to Warnas' studio Review all the photos and bring those with Isabelle Royer What about me? What do I do with the grenade? Find the pin - Are you all right? - Yes, very well Hi Dad, it's me Just wanted to comfirm our dinner tomorrow I think I'll bring Dominique I hope you are well. Kisses. Bye. What are you doing there? - Good day, sir - Hello, Amelia I'm minding my grandson this week and so I cannot take care of Raoul - Sorry - Don't worry, leave it with me - Have a good day - You too, Amelia Good day, Raoul Oh, Raoul! Shut up! Send me that. What did I tell you? Get down from there. Here or at home, it is the same. Off the couch. That is rude. Pardon? You turn, look at me, and sigh. So I detect: "Shit, a blind man. Have I left anything in the way?" Is that not rude? Adrien Narvik Commander Philippe Lassalle. I'm in charge with the investigation into the death of Miss Royer Maybe you should give up coffee, Commander. Sit First, thank you for responding to our summons and coming here. I imagine that you have other things to do There are only a few questions. It won't take long. I have all the time in the world Did you know the victim, Mr. Narvik? I knew her piano better I am tuner. It is my job. Tuner I'd rather be a virtuoso We can't be both. - Do you work for a company? - I'm a craftsman I work on my own. I prefer the independence. You don't like dogs Are the blind required to like dogs? I don't think I implied that, but this is not very affectionate. It is rare. No... No, I don't like dogs They mess on the sidewalks. The blind don't appreciate that much. Go on Go, go - It doesn't bother me - It does bother me Hey, go, go! Get on the couch. How many times did you go to Miss Royer's? One time only - The 1st of September - Maybe I can verify that, if you want Not necessary That date appears in the images of the building's security camera Unfortunately it was sabotaged the day before the crime and we are missing recordings for the last 24 hours Can you help us? One time I tuned the piano and I had no reason to return. Did you see anything that caught your attention when you were with her? I saw nothing. No. I heard nothing, either. I noticed nothing in particular. Can you teach me to do that? - What? - That trick with the dog I cannot get that knucklehead to obey me I could use some good advice And it bothers you Yes? Excuse me Warnas and his friend have filed a complaint against you Can you come? I'm coming I must leave She likes you Pardon? The young woman who entered Her movements... Her perfume... She's looking for your attention Let's limit the advice to the dog next time A colleague of mine will take a statement from you Don't be afraid to tell us everything you felt during your visit... ... to Miss Royer's I'll try my best Thanks Sorry, I missed the dog If you are suspicious of my blindness I can bring you my medical history That won't be necessary - Hello Dad - Hello son - Good evening. - Dominique Goodnight Choosing from wine and flowers we decided on this bottle of Villa Florida It's perfect Thank you - How are you? - Not good I thought that in a democracy the police are here to protect us, not to frighten us Arrests at any time, streets controlled arbitrarily No, they don't have that right Not to diffuse the debate, but... I have nothing to do with those things I work in the Criminal Brigade I only investigate the identities and affairs of murder suspects - But mistakes happen! - There aren't any in journalism? It is not our fault if we relay false reports You could verify before publishing, but you create unbalanced views in order to sell it - You are stereotyping a little, Dad. - Oh, excuse me... I thought it was a stereotype party If you're smoking, I'd like a coffee Me too, please And the polls? Is it possible that you care about the polls? They're pretty accurate... Not true. It is the press that says so. They can find all the culprits within 24 hours Do you not think the police are aggressive with the media you see? They can do what they want. - Calm down - I am calm - You're not here by yourself - I love arguing with your father - I see - OK I love you I'd like to remind you of the value of the bars at your disposal The greens represents €5,000 the yellows €10,000 and the reds €50,000 Ladies and gentlemen, we will move to the next batch This time is a magnificent Bugatti Atlantic A very rare model generously donated by our host Mr. Serguei Constantin Leave it, I'll do it Thanks for dinner, and for your patience He exaggerates a bit but he's helped me And it's not necessary to disagree with him for being my friend I don't mind him being your companion It's just that he's a little thick - Anyway, I'm happy - That is paramount I would like you to be happy too Don't worry about me - You should take a vacation - It's not a good time It is never a good time for you It bothers me that you all worry about me But get ready to have Raoul for a few days That is the same as a vacation I would, but... Dominique is allergic to dog hair That I cannot debate With respect to this "Work of art", as Jacques says it is true that I have donated it to the Association but is the jewel of my collection I like it enormously and I assure you that I plan to immediately be it's owner again I hope, dear Jacques, you have found an opponent of my size because I do not yield easily We understand well Know that we have several potential buyers on the telephone All right, let's go! Ladies and gentlemen, reserve price is 100,000 Euros 100,000 Euros! - Yes sir, Good evening Good evening, sir - I'm calling about the Bugatti - We start with 100,000 150,000 Mr. X, who wants to stay anonymous, bids 150,000 Excuse me, we have Mr. X on the phone who has bid 150,000 170,000? 170,000 in the room, we're at 170,000 180,000? 180,000 230,000 230,000. Want to bid 250,000? - Yes, I do 250,000 250,000 270,000 270,000 I bid again 300,000 300,000 300,000 300,000 450,000 Is at 450,000. What do we do? No, I'm sorry. I'm done Thanks for bidding. Declined. Declined? Without bidding? For 450,000, won by Mr. Serguei Constantin You want to talk to him? It will happen, do not hang up Sorry sir, Mr. X wants to congratulate you Yes Yes? - Bravo, sir! - Thanks A beautiful duel - It was almost ruined - I should not have tried But now, glory to the victor However, I want to ask a favor Yes, I'm listening I've had the pleasure of seeing it May I also have the privilege of hearing it? No gentleman would refuse Give me a couple of seconds Listen to this... Commander - There's nothing in there - I know, wait with the dog No. Keep it. Raoul! Does it make you dream? No, not at all, but... it does get me out of the routine Where are we? Serguei Constantin, host and patron of the evening He invited some rich friends to raise funds for a partnership The explosive was placed for and had only one victim The windows here just rattled. It was a professional job It seems that the killer called at the end of the event, asking the victim to get in and start the car The blast was the grand finale of the evening He seems to have sense of humor That's the least that can be said of him It was an evening organized against anti-personnel landmines Ai, just so Two murders in one week, Nice gift Yes, I'm on call It is for me to not get bored I'm suspicious of the sequence Well, nothing in this one matches Neither the "modus operandi" or the personality of the victim There is something in common The killer likes the spectacular Could there be a link between the two victims? What? - No, nothing, but... - But what? Do you really think the two things are related? We are here to find it We found these microphones There were everywhere I think that put the killer onto the auction Were there no cameras? No, only the security system He just installed microphones We did not get anything. They are very nervous And everyone knows at least one minister Take their identifications and let them go Thanks gentlemen, you are free to go But before you go give me your IDs, please What's up? Do me a full search for me on a certain Gabriel Narvik. - The piano tuner? - The blind one Kicked out? Don't worry. I have something he'll like Come in Come in Sorry, I should have knocked It's nothing With time I'm better How long has it been? Two years Then you must learn to smile I can give you some lessons if you want What's in the folder? Warnas' photos I think will interest you - He said he only saw her once - Maybe he forgot Yes. I'll refresh his memory Want me to join you? Do you need me? No, thanks I'm taking Raoul Behave like an idiot and send you to the kennel Good day Commander Good morning Mr. Narvik. I'm not bothering you? Can we talk? Come in Thank you - Do you drink coffee? - No, thanks Do not tell me you've stopped You did tell me to Have you found the culprit yet, Commander? No, that's why I'm here I read your statement. I confess that I was impressed You have a great sense for detail Without sight, one pays attention to other things I think you can help me You arouse my curiosity Good day, the time is 14:00 To best see the time we have left, I hear it as it passes Schwartzman, 11 rue Blanche. Does that mean anything? It is a specialist piano collection - re you buying or selling? - No A friend bought one and I was wondering if you knew them Very good pieces If your friend needs a tuner feel free to give my phone number Can you give me an hour, Mr. Narvik? I know, I should quit I took seeing for granted before I lost sight I imagine it's the same thing, with health You stink, Raoul Does your dog get wet? It is not my dog, it was my wife's My condolences I did not say she died The meaning was in your voice In addition... if she left, she would have taken the dog No? She died two years ago in a car accident Were you driving? Excuse me, forget my question Please come Is there a problem? I do not like the smell of blood Do you know where we are? I'm blind, not an amnesiac You said you came once A piano of this quality needs to be tuned regularly I try to memorize the location of things because when I return somewhere... I would not like to fall on on this woman's floor on my next visit I am convinced that the murderer knew this place He had already been here You could have crossed in the hallway or the stairway Maybe... but no one told me he was a killer Do you remember anything in particular? A phone call, a visit? No I think the killer... was hiding in the closet upstairs He waited for the driver to exit He almost certainly killed her while he was locking the door with the key He grabbed a necklace from above He must have... Can I interrupt? What is expected of me, Commander? Why did you lie, Mr. Narvik? Why did you say you only saw Ms. Royer once? I said I only came here once, I never said I only saw her once You are playing with words? Or did you intentionally forgot to mention it? I had no time. I remind you that we were interrupted Do you invite all customers a drink? No Only women I like But I'm flattered Commander To most people I look like a cripple, but you... you imagine me as a criminal It's a promotion At the same time, I confess I don't see how you could do it Because I'm blind? This direction is a sufficient indication of where the victim lay Do not forget I know the location of everything in this apartment But I cannot not understand why this young woman was killed Ah, the principal point of all cases. It's the motive. No? Constantin Serguei, he was a client of yours? That name does not tell me anything But if I understand your question correctly, that man must be dead and should have a piano A Schwartzman piano Is that right? Do you play? Do you doubt? I'd like to hear it Without Raoul already? That moron is sitting up in the seat the car and didn't want to get out What did you find on Narvik? It wasn't he who tuned Constantin's piano It was an old Russian, Natasha Korskova Is that all? Nothing remarkable No record, no family... The guy has no history He went to a Catholic school What's bothering you? I do not know why or how, but I'm sure it is him He killed them both Then let's try it No Commander, come back in 10 minutes. She can't see you right now I've already lost 20 minutes because of your idiot colleague - I must speak with you - Right now, I have no time The same person killed both Royer and Constantin, and I know who he is Postpone my appointment by 15 minutes Why did he risk seeing her? To get her to talk and to learn her customs To copy the key She was not suspicious of a blind man Also he did not know that he would be photographed She is smiling, because he is seducing her It's not like that Do you find him handsome? Not bad. Yeah. Do you have a motive? Not yet - Proof? - Soon - What do you have? - A strong intuition The "modus operandi" are different but they have the same impact, as intended Are you serious about this? Yes Remember that I am expecting a perfect case The victims worked for the French government We are 5 million employees. Do you think he's going to kill us all? Warnas thought Royer worked for Military Intelligence. She was paid via a shell company in Luxembourg. All her friends in photos are foreigners, except Narvik Constantin was also? a secret agent? No, but he has a furniture company that supplies the French Army The tables and chairs in all the headquarters are his. A prostitute, a seller of furniture and a blind killer. That's your hypothesis. Let me inspect Narvik's house. So all the press can make fun of us? That's a good idea Just what I need I have a girl cut into pieces and a millionaire shattered Do you read the papers? Constantin's death must be a reckoning Surely by a competitor Regarding the girl cut into pieces You've arrested the boyfriend, the prime suspect. It's not him. I believe him. He was paranoid and was afraid. You amaze me. Looks like you hit the man who was at his place. He had a live grenade in his hand. First you destroy his friend, then one of you hits him And now you tell me he's innocent? And now you bet on the blind? Leave us two minutes, Héloïse Does this mean I'm also blind? In any case, I'm not Is it because your wife was killed with a car you think you can do this? Are you thinking straight yet? It is you who is here Life is very unfair, but it's like that You're going to see a doctor, and not fuck me over Do not end up unemployed and miserable! This is the last time I'll cover for you Find yourself a woman, dammit! - Want to get a drink or something? - No, it's okay I thank you for today, you were not obliged to go with me to the head This is the first time that you have given me a compliment I appreciate it that you are on my side I'm always on your side Good night, Héloïse Good night Yes? Sorry to bother you. Did I wake you? No, I'm just having a big conversation with Raoul I had dinner with a colleague in Intelligence. New develoments. - Want to see it or should I wait until tomorrow? - No, it's okay For customers we are always open I'll arrive within 5 minutes It will be better in here, right? Come It is difficult to do it out there Want me to help you? As you wish If not for those, I'd say you're a soldier I'll make you feel good I don't doubt it This is not the best time to walk your dog I tried to give it to my son, but no luck I'll take him if you want. For a few days. And if it feels strange, you could always go see him. Is this for me or for Raoul? For you - For you to talk - I'm listening Military intelligence have a file on Isabelle Royer She was observed when watching Hussein Haqqani The Niassim chief Pakistan's Secret Service He met her in his two recent trips to France They wanted to stop her, but MoD intervened The message was clear: "Do not touch" But that's not all. Constantin. He was in arms trafficking. It seems that the Army used him for sales that were delicate. Good job. Which one of us is getting more accustomed to the compliments? Has he already been asked how he felt? Who? Narvik. He must guess, interpret, create images. I hear a car pass ... is a diesel Raoul growling... The hum of a streetlight... But I don't know what the color of the car is I don't know who my dog ​​growls at and I cannot see what's on the wall illuminated by the lantern I'm in the dark... alone You have moved Is it a threat? I feel ... I hear breathing ... I don't know what want from me You are... The real question is why he kills. Do you think Narvik's mind is handicapped? No, there is another thing. It's like he was sure to have a reason You must check his background. Every detail of his life. Something we missed Don't stay there, grab hold of the case Go As you order You're leaving already? You paid for the night. I have an appointment. Who was the idiot who moved this gate! - It is here - Thanks What are you doing? What's this? Get me out of this! Excuse me. Yes? Sorry to bother you, but there's something that will interest you. Héloïse, I'll call you later, . There was another murder. Morin was on duty and they called me for reinforcement. Do it not seem like they have enough already? Leave that to Morin and focus on your case. We want to see one thing, to convince Rochambeaud and not appear confused about Narvik, at least to Madame de Defense. Precisely The guy who taps his stick on the ground killed a man with a Paratrooper tattoo Surely an ex-military He was massacred He was disfigured. It was to draw attention There is another thing He had a diamond in his ear He emptied his pockets but he had not removed it - As if it had not been seen - Thanks The best for last: Warnas was released Two witnesses confirmed he was with students photographing that night, not at Royer's - He was right - I'll call you - Good morning sister - Good morning, Commander Look, it's him Gabriel is the small Narvik. Do you happen to remember him? I try to remember everyone But one remembers some more than the others Gabriel was a good boy Passionate about aviation He dreamed of being a fighter pilot And did so - Are you sure? - Ah, yes When he crashed, I went to his funeral We should never bury our students We are witholding the identity of the one murdered last night - Who is it? - Louis Sorbier A former paratrooper Apparently he was a mercenary He remains military Tighten your contact at Intelligence. But if you can soften him up let him spill everything he knows It seems Warnas has been exonerated You want me to apologize? The real Gabriel Narvik died in a plane crash He lied about his identity He killed Isabelle Royer, Serguei Constantin and also a mercenary, last night in an alley Three different "modus operandi", not connected crimes, but all the victims had a link with the Army I don't know exactly how it happens but it is a cleaning operation I don't think it will stop His name is Andre. A War orphan. Soldier from age 18 marksman, frogman, 15 years in Special Operations and decorated 8 times He was wounded four years ago in Afghanistan That's how he lost his sight. The Ministry of Defense gave him a new identity, that of a dead soldier, Gabriel Narvik The Ministry of the Interior closed his file. He stated that heroes are not murderers. Since when do you not share your information? For two hours I received clear orders, and even insults. It's top secret. You have to fix a leak When you have the press you can no longer hide Nice, but I'm the Director because you've never closed gates If I knew how to close gates I would ba a gamekeeper Maybe it's not too late Meanwhile here is what to do If you try anything you'll come out crushed - You used to be more combative - More of an idiot too Do not be a hero, Philippe. They'll demolish you. Object: the mission, no link Hussein Haqqani will be in Paris tonight The operation is confirmed Should you have more problems with the police Necessary arrangements have been made Dot, dot, dot Should problems persist Cmdr. Lassalle is to be considered an obstacle to the mission You are authorized to treat him as such Raoul! Look Look what this guy brought you It's good, right? Thank you Well. It's just three days but... if watching him will help you function... I thought Dominique was allergic He makes an effort, like everyone else Yes... like everyone else I'm wondering Do you know where the photo albums are? I want to show them to Dominique Your mother kept them in the bedroom closet ...is clearly a French transport helicopter performing evasive maneuvers before being reached... I wonder how the Taliban can get these missiles I wonder how we can enforce these things Dominique says on the Internet, there are missiles, the French say. ...is the 4th French helicopter demolished in two weeks You can not save these seals, Dad. ...more than several sources indicate that anti-aircraft missiles short-range that were made in France They do not know how they got at the hands of the insurgents "You have a new message" Lassalle? It's Warnas, I must talk to you I know how to catch the bastard But this time come alone. You have one hour. It's Lassalle I got your message, I'm on my way. Don't do anything stupid before I get there. Do you hear me Warnas? I'm coming. Shit! Warnas? Good evening, Commander I'm glad you accepted my invitation He did not want to call you. I had to insist. People should control their impulses, Commander They are too predictable This isn't spectacular enough for you Do I have a reservation to be cut into pieces too? - Are you disappointed? - About what? To still be alive We have that in common, Commander We both thought that the other should be dead. Guilt, loneliness... I know how you feel I lost enough companions to know what it is to just survive You know the rest Why are you doing this? I keep doing what I did before my accident, I serve my country Killing civilians? It is likely they were connected with terrorist networks You are either a remarkable liar or very naïve I have a few flaws but lying isn't one of them Wake up, Narvik You removed a middle man, a businessman, and a mercenary All you've done is eliminate the witnesses of arms trafficking You think you're a soldier but... you've become a killer who works for arms dealers You'd say anything to save your life Not my life, it is to save the killer Your sudden kindness touches me, Commander But for now letting you go runs the risk of me be charged with murder, rather than you. Isn't that right? This is your weapon, no? Narvik forced Warnas to call me to his place He killed him and waited - I don't understand - I'm not surprised Lassalle You're not in a position to be smart, OK? Yes sir For now I'm just trying to understand and what I do not understand is how a blind man could have killed the victim with your gun before you arrived He must have taken it from my car. I leave it in the glove compartment. That's right First, you lose your service revolver then you meet with a criminal witness for an investigation that is not yours without even notifying a colleague Isn't this report a little suspicious? Sorry for the delay My mother was hospitalized and I left the hospital when I saw the message Please sit Lieutenant I'll tell you how I see things Warnas calls you he attacks, you fight and a shot escapes Come on, François! We're wasting time. Do you think me so stupid? In your place, I would argue it was an accident The self-defense plea Narvik did not work alone. I think he was manipulated. Now he's a victim! He set a trap because I bothered him. It you bothered him so much, why didn't he kill you? I don't know... I think he appreciated me. That's it! A blind killer and a fucking lover Shit, Lassalle! Relax! You sit there or I lock you up! Is that understood? Sorry, I missed I read your file You seem to have trouble recovering from the death of your wife. Your superiors speak of derangement. A depressive state. A tendency toward violence, perhaps suicidal. That's right. I concocted this whole thing just to commit suicide in jail. No... I think of it as an interrogation that ends badly. Leo reported that broke you broke the nose a witness before threatening to explode a grenade It is similar to what just happened Losing control is normal, you can't stop, right? Tell me... I wonder... what is happening up here And I'd like to know who is giving you orders - Who are you obeying - No one, the law Look at me when I speak Is it the Ministry of Defence that is giving the orders? This is over Commander Lassalle will be suspended, for now, pending investigation I am against suspensions Commander Lassalle is to remain in police custody. Effective immediately. We have 3 unsolved murders, Commissioner. If Cmdr. Lassalle is detained, I must hand over case files meaning the investigation is closed which is something that supports the Commander's theory I'll give you one hour to prepare your reports - But in his office and under surveillance - OK We are on the 5th floor, we're not going to jump out the window I have orders We're in Criminal Offenses. If we get angry, a history for either of you can appear It's up to you Is that what you want? OK, we'll wait here There's a coffee machine Héloïse! I waited a lifetime for that Since you don't even know if I've had spouses or not, I'm taking advantage My contact in Intelligence says Sorbier has nothing on you He's just a guard dog But he told me Hussein Haqqani of the Pakistani secret service is back in Paris. But not to see Isabelle Royer. He comes to explain the origin of the Taliban's missiles He's Isabelle Royer's contact with the buyer Maybe the next target of Narvik. Your friend could locate him. You talk to him. If you find something say that you'll call me. Why? Because he has been a little bold and ... And he bothers you. He's too young for me. We're both going to have to speak. Excuse me? Can you help me? On your knees On your knees! Put them on. You also Héloïse. Narvik! Narvik, are you here? Objective: Mission, no link. Hussein Haqqani will be in Paris tonight The operation is confirmed. You should not have more problems with the police. Necessary arrangements have been made Dot, dot, dot. Should problems persist, Cmdr. Lassalle is to be considered an obstacle to the missio You are authorized to treat him as such Good evening, General. Thank you. Captain, over here please. Care. Okay, there's no problem. This way, please. Thank you Good evening. Can I help you to get to the bar? That is appreciated - Here it is - Thank you Lassalle has to be removed It is not necessary. He's been neutralized. Not necessary? You have your orders! He's just escaped Where is Lassalle? I'll ask one last time. Where did he go? I will expell you if you don't help me to find him Come in Excuse the interruption Commissioner - Héloïse's mother is on the line - She'll call her back You must call the hospital. It seems urgent. Forward it here Are you deaf? I said to forward the call here. Hello, Mom? I know where Narvik is I'm sorry, Mom. I'm busy. I'm in a meeting A meeting with the idiot? That's it, yes Quiet down Mom, then I'll come Haqqani is attending a conference at the Middle East Institute on the military situation in Afghanistan Narvik will surely be there I called but... security did not believe me We should try through the police channel Héloïse? I need you. Me too, Mom. I'll try. Yes, yes... I'm coming No, do not come If sirens are blaring it will end in a bloodbath I have another plan. Listen to me. I do what I can, Mom. I'm not the only one who decides. If I could, I'd be there now Mom... do not cry Please do not cry I will come when I can Go Héloïse, finish this later I want to know where you are She's going to see her mother What if she escapes? You're starting to annoy me, Cossiga It is reciprocated I must go take my place Can I take advantage by having you escort me to my chair? I don't believe that would be a good idea Let me insist... Colonel What is wrong? Who were the targets? Pardon? I'm told the targets were outside the terrorist networks. What were your goals? - Why these questions? - What were your goals? What are you implying? - Have I ever lied to you? - No, Colonel I wanted to give you the opportunity to test what remains of a soldier Do not make me regret it I need to know if I can still trust you Yes... Colonel Police Thank you My dear friends first thanks for honoring me with your presence I will be brief but it is necessary that I definitely dispel, I hope, an unfortunate ambiguity about the origin of certain weapons I'd appreciate your seat. Recall beforehand that the NATO forces chief Good evening, Commander announced that the coalition of International... Let's finish the game an offensive in Afghanistan I will stand slowly and you will follow me You should put away your weapon Don't make me call security I'd advise against it. It is not me who is hunted by the police It is you Also, I would like that there be no victims... needlessly. the withdrawal of American troops which is actually... camouflaged attacks against our country Likewise to that American warning... Don't do it You're worth more than that 700 euros per month is what I'm worth It's my disabled adult allowance It is my worth to society There is no need to kill Haqqani to prove you're worth something Stop your psychological counselling, Commander I have a mission and I will comply Mission? You call this a mission? There were 5 French soldiers shot down in a helicopter in Afghanistan It was a French missile that killed them I think that missile was sold by your friends That's what they want to keep secret You are erasing the traces of their greedy tricks You work for those who killed those French soldiers - Your brothers in arms - I do not believe you You were chosen because you're the ideal culprit "Soldier wounded in the head wants revenge" When you're finished with Haqqani they will gun you down Why do you say that? There are two snipers stationed at the front We are in their sights Then it will be my last mission Don't give them that pleasure I beg you Narvik! You're lost. You cannot escape, you will be killed. I can help you, Narvik I've holstered weapon Narvik! Do not try to stop me, Commander It is a political issue which surpasses you And me too Let's go Kill me if you want I think we have more in common than we want to admit, Commander Maybe Let's go Yes, Héloïse Where are you? Thanks Shit! Watch out! Where are we going now? Now we're going to finish this mission with dignity Give me your weapons, quickly All your weapons. And the clips too. Do it! How could you do this? He could you be one of those soldiers It was an accident Selling arms to the enemy not an accident It is a betrayal Give me a key. Don't you have a key? Everything is in the glovebox. Nothing. These weapons were sold to Pakistanis They were never to cross the Afghan border The Pakistanis were the ones who screwed up Its secret services are infiltrated by the Taliban You lied to me As you did me Be right back I did remove your accomplices Behind you! Five bullets One for each comrade who you betrayed I served almost 10 years under the orders of this peice of garbage Yes but now it's over Give me your gun What will I do while I'm in prison? We will find a good lawyer I'll tell the truth, that you were manipulated They'll listen I am a soldier, there is nothing to tell You owe nothing and won't be abandoned You just say that to comfort me I know what you intend to do But I will not shoot Look on the bright side of things You're finally going to know... if you really want to join your wife... and in a few seconds, you'll either be pleased... or realize that you want to live and must demonstrate it by preventing me from firing In one way or another I do you a favor But now... perhaps you should consider the girl outside She smells so good And who risks her career to save you You decide Commander We are not required to shoot There are not many people in which I can continue to trust, Commander I would appreciate it if you did not disappoint Are you okay? You got the keys? Thank you - You have to see a doctor - Okay, it's nothing But I cannot drive, we must find someone to take me Let's see who we can find Hello Héloïse Is your Mom doing better? Don't lie to me any more Want to go looking for Raoul? No No more of that dog If you want me to take him... If you want to, but... He eats a lot I don't care You're not afraid of anything Now are we on personal terms? Ripped by genrules
