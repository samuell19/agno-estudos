- I used to have random visions and I could not explain what they were. My mother taught me meditation since I was 12 years old. And I never took it seriously and I was using my mantra and everything else when I was younger but I never had any visions, I couldn't care less. The Buddhism part of things that was more part of her life. I was more drawn towards the simplicity of my dad's life. The business world, it was more pragmatic and I was more drawn to that. When I was 16 years old, I was in a boarding school, my dad sent me over there as a punishment because I was kinda failing my grades in a public system. And when I went to school, I thought I could probably put the transcendental meditations to use. For some reason, I felt compelled that I could do something, I felt more powerful that year. I don't know if it's because I was turning 16 and I was more attracted to girls, I'm not sure. But I felt there was something changing in me. I remember having like panning headaches and nosebleeds that year. And powerful visions of people in my class. One example was this girl who was in my Spanish class. All of a sudden, during the class, I saw her on a scooter leaving the school and she was hit by a car on the right-hand side. And she died. And that shocked me. And I didn't know what to do with this. So, during the break, I decided to write down notes explaining the accident. I was quite goofy about this, I didn't know how to deal with this so I want to let them know what could happen. So I put that in a pen case and then once she read it during the break, she shouted, who did this? And she basically, I said, it's me. And so, she just like shouted at me. And the whole event kind of blew in and that was quickly forgotten. And then, a year later, the accident that I described happened. She was hit by a car exactly the same location I described, but the man who hit her was the Spanish teacher that was in the class I was having a vision in. And she never died, but I guess, the interpretation of the death was that she turned paraplegic so she ended up being in a wheelchair and she never come back to school after that. But the fact is that I saw this. I also was able to use meditations to come out of my body and see objects from a distance. And in that case, I was in the boarding school going to the girls' dorm and was able to hover over the night table of a girl at the front seat to impress her and I described three objects that were on the night table that she placed purposely the same day. Because it was the game that we are playing. I was asking her to place one object that day and she placed three. And when I came back the next day and I told her what I saw, she freaked out and she turned all white bell and I basically lost the opportunity of being her boyfriend. It carried on for many years after that. To the point where when I first met my wife at 20, she basically said to me, I don't want you to have those visions. And I want you to share them with me because you might see me dead or splitting up or anything like that. And I respected that and for 10 years, she said, you shut it down. I almost imagine some grid falling all around me like a cage to protect me from anything that will come. And that worked for 10 years until those visions came back in full form. I started to build a life for ourselves. In 2005, we started a business. Starting with honey and we built a multinational starting with Canada and moving on to the US. And then England and then New Zealand. We branched out to healthy stores, grocery stores, pharmacies and then working with Cancer Research Institutes. I was not really thinking of the consciousness movement. My life was working, working, working. My dad was a businessman and therefore, I was very comfortable in that world. Nothing else mattered to me. We became the leading brand of that type of honey in North America very quickly. In 2009, my wife and I decided to go on holiday to Peru and when we got back from that holiday, I remember basically having very vivid visions that really bothered me. I was waking up at two o'clock in the morning and writing them down because it was so strong and so vivid. And at that time, my wife just got pregnant. I not only saw my child at the age of 20 years old, not knowing the sex of the baby at the time. I saw her face, I saw her walking in the corridor and she was taller than my wife, and she had a dimple on her chin which is strange because I don't have a dimple and my wife doesn't have a dimple. So I described our daughter to my wife and she just was very pleased with that because it kind of comforted her in her first pregnancy that was something that was actually positive. More striking to me was the visions I had about those various events. So, one of them was about the assassination of a man. I could see him through the eyes of someone else. I was basically on the top of a rooftop of a building. And I could see this man in the car and the window was rolled down. The car was in motion and it was a black car. And the man had a mustache and I didn't recognize him from anywhere, but at the same time, while seeing him, I was having downloads of information. So, impressions of who he was and the words were Prime Minister assassinated. These were the two main words that came to me. And I also knew that the man was dead already. So it was not so much a vision of someone who was going to die, but something that already happened. The next day when I woke up, I was looking at Google images and Prime Minister assassinated with the key words and the face of that man showed up. I could see him there, it was exactly him. And I recognized him, I told my wife it was him that she was watching it on my laptop. And for whatever reason, I thought, let's switch on the television. And the first thing that we saw, the news report was a live report of La Hague in Europe and having a tribunal about some of the potential killers of Rafic Hariri, the Prime Minister of Lebanon. It was a live report and they were explaining that two or three men were brought in for a testimony but they got released and they couldn't hold them responsible for it. But I had still no idea why I was seeing those visions about this man who died. And how this relate to my life in any shape or form. And I also had visions of other events that happened the same day, which was the crash of a FedEx airplane. The crash of another airplane with children on board. They were trying to go to a skiing resort and that airplane really did crash. And I saw those events the next day in the news. And those visions changed my life completely. My wife also had to accept it too because I could not shake them up. It was something that stayed within me and I could not get rid of them. When you think about again, the remote viewing program that was created by the Stanford Research Institute and the CIA got involved and created the Star Gate program. The program got shut down when it became public and got released The New York Times. And the government said shut it down. Because the money spent in that was not properly used but what most people don't know is that that program, instead of being shut down got multiplied by like five times over time. Now, there's so many different faction and groups of remote viewers around the world. But all link to that original program, the Stargate program is still very much active. From 2009 to 2011, I had huge amount of visions. And those visions were becoming more and more intense in terms of cataclysmic, like seismic activities, tsunamis, earthquakes, fires, you name it. And this was causing me grief in a sense that I was trying to build up a multinational business and then all of a sudden, I was bombarded with those visions on a daily basis. Sometimes during the day, I was in a meeting, all of a sudden boom, those images came to me. I thought that I need to see someone to help me out with those visions because it's disturbing my life, it's not gonna be helping me down the road. So, I booked an appointment with a clinical hypnotherapist. One day, I had a dream about this boy. And he had big eyes, he had high cheek bones, bright smile and he looked like in his 20s. Almost like a surfer dude from California but not looking so human. His eyes were like three times the size of a human eye. The face of that boy stayed with me for the whole day. I was looking through the window and there he was, it was so weird. And so, I came back home and after supper, I decide to sit down on my sofa. And that's when I closed my eyes for a few seconds and I could feel this whirlwind around me. It was a weird kind of energy wind around me and then all of a sudden, the boy was standing up right in front of me. And he had a blue glow around him, still smiling. He was excited to see me, but I was completely petrified. To the extent like physically, I was not able to move. My hands were glued to the sofa, my eyes, as soon as I opened them, I could not move them after that. And I could not speak. He spoke to me telepathically and said, my name is Zoar. I am from the Galactic Alliance. And that was very strange because I never cared about ETs before, about UFOs. When you talk to me about the Galactic Alliance, I said to myself, I have to idea what that means. I had many questions and for whatever reason, it may have sound selfish but I was asking him about the visions I was having. Because I booked this appointment with the clinical hypnotherapist. So while waiting for this appointment, he showed up in my life. When I asked him about my visions, I said, I saw people dying and we saw things. And he said, why yes, so what? Things happen. Our souls live forever. And therefore, illusion of this world is part of your reality. And he was so cold in a way that he was so pragmatic about things that to me, it felt that he was not living on the same reality as I was for sure. When he vanished, basically, it was like a blue haze. It was very shocking to me that I had this encounter My God, I've lost it. So I was walking back to walk towards the kitchen and I just remember grabbing my cup of tea not even thinking of looking at it and I was still thinking about what just happened and I was like, putting it towards my lips and I said, whoa, that's freezing cold. And I put it down and right away, I looked at the stove and the time showed that I had over two hours of missing time. And the time when I was talking to this being was maybe like 15 minutes at the most. And that was on the 11th of November 2011, so 11 11 11. And I never paid attention to the synchronicities of the dates at that time. So, when I went to see the hypnotherapist, our first meeting was about regression and trying to go back to my past lives as well as my visions and trying to make my visions disappear but her idea was, how about we make you control them if you want to? It's up to you. You can either choose to control your visions or you can make them go away. And I thought, well maybe I should try to control them. So she taught me how to do self-hypnosis with tape for like 17 minutes, I was listening to it. And I could see more things. Like control and have visions on demand. She was also trying to explore the facets of my past lives. And if maybe those visions had anything to do with that. I could see my life as an Egyptian. And I was in the sand, I was outside. And right next to me on my right were human-like beings that were at least 14 feet tall. They had animal heads or birds' heads. And I could see the people in front of me and they were just looking at those beings, being frightened by them. And I was next to them believing that I was their creator. A geneticist. At one point, I could see this triangular space craft that showed up above the pyramid. And so right away, I got the impression that those creatures next to me came from ET technology or at least I was helped to create them from the ET technology. So the hypnotherapist, she asked me, when did these visions start? Then I told her that when I was younger, I used to have random visions so the hypnotherapist wants to go back to the time when I was 16. When I closed my eyes, I was sent back to when I was 16 years old. I was looking around and it was dark. And I was on the school grounds of that boarding school in France. And then I looked back at my feet, realizing that my feet were leaving the ground. So I was being lifted up. I kept describing, so now I'm placed on my back in the air. And then I just go feet first into a space craft and I could see a door opening on the side. It was very bright and I was going in feet first. As I got into the space craft, I saw those weird, tall, gray aliens. And they have that big, black eyes, a stiff mouth and hardly any nose, no ears, elongated fingers. Way below their knee caps, longer than human hands. I had some IV drips on my arms and all of that. But I wasn't really feeling the pain. Then, the tall gray aliens started to argue and I could hear them doing like a very deep sound like this. And I looked at them and they stopped. They stopped being busy around me. When that happened, the hypnotherapist stopped the session on purpose. She basically was so shocked what I was describing that she was not prepared for this. We were about to talk about visions but she said, I have got zero clue about the aliens. I don't know how to deal with this. Give me a few weeks and then come back and then we can start the session again so I can read up about it. So I can ask you the right questions, at least help you with the topic. So I said sure, that's fine. So we waited some time and then I came back for more sessions. So we repeated the same session and I was seeing exactly the same thing. Being lifted up, being into a space craft and then IV drips. When the gray aliens argued, she asked me, so can you ask them what they're arguing about? I said well, how can I ask them? They speak different language. And so because in your subconscious mind you can ask them the question and they will be able to respond to you in English or in French, whatever you want. And when I asked them whether we're arguing about they did respond in English, saying we can't touch you because you're being tampered with. She said, can you then ask them to show you what they mean by that? Being tampered with. And then a bunch of symbols showed up between me and them. So there were holographic symbols. There was an upside down triangle with like three dots, like a star shape and like a stick. None of that meant anything to me but I was describing it to the hypnotherapist. Then she said, well, what do these symbols mean? And the gray aliens will not tell me anything. The therapist said, can they then show you where you've seen those symbols before? If they can tell you what they mean. And then at that point, my whole world changed when I blacked out under hypnosis. And I felt that I was going backwards very fast and I had no idea what was going on. And also when I opened my eyes, under hypnosis. And I could see my hands, and they were like baby-like hands. I was in a baby body and I could feel this black and silky bath that had intelligence to it. And I could see through the glass, there was some shapes like silhouettes walking around. I could not quite tell what it was. So, because of that, the hypnotherapist then said to me, well, can you come out of your body to find out where you are? And so, I followed exactly those instructions, I came out of my body and I can see this massive spacecraft that's a few miles long. And I know exactly where I am inside the spacecraft. Oh, and I can see the earth underneath it. I could hear the therapist's voice panicking. Saying oh, go back in your body. And so I went back into my body. And then she asked me to come out again but stay in the room. You can see what's in the room. And I did that. There were like, green tinge and orange tinge to the walls, everything felt alive. Everything had an intelligence to it. Like the craft itself had life. The man and the woman were wearing the upside down triangle symbol that those tall grey aliens in the spacecraft showed me. The woman, by the way, looked very beautiful, long hair. When you think of Poseidon or Zeus or whatever, these statues, they looked exactly the same. I remembered how severe and stern they seem to me. It was not like a loving feeling in a way. And they were not experiencing the human emotions the way we feel them. It was very different. For them, it was very scientific and to the point. The man then spoke to me in a very stern manner again and said to me, you are supposed to be living a life in a human form and die. That's all we're asking of you, that's it. Nothing else. We live within an illusion, therefore this reality is made up for our experiences. And that's pretty much what he was trying to tell me. You are supposed to be living your life and then die. And so we can learn from these human emotions from grief, to love to hate. Because those emotions are so complex. Over the years, I have learned that those beings were Annunaki. So Zoar was my younger brother. As an Annunaki being, I volunteered to be incarnating into this form as a human body. Most people also volunteer their soul-being to create this reality so we can have that experience. So, Zoar broke the rules of the Galactic Alliance to come and see me in my human form. He said to me, because you had those experiences now and you're kinda awakened, you need to go back to Earth and start awakening the Starseeds of this planet. These are the words he used. I mentioned that to the hypnotherapist and so that's it. That's what he told me, he will not share anything more. And I said, I don't know what to do with this. Basically, it's nice but I can't do anything with it. I don't have a guide or manual to follow through with this request. When my mother got pregnant, there was a lot of mystery around my birth. She got pregnant and then had a hemorrhage, went to the hospital to check if the baby was all right. And that's when they told her that she was carrying twins. And that one of the baby was older than the other. They were maybe three to four weeks apart. In the southwest of France, in small town, This had never been seen before, it was kind of an anomaly, They told her, it's most likely the first fetus will die. Because he's not growing, he's not developing. Which is exactly what happened. She had a miscarriage and she ended up just carrying me to term, nine months. And when I was born, the first layer of my skin fell apart and I was screaming in pain probably for six months and it was not growing back by itself. So my family resorted to the services of doctors and tried to give me all sorts of bath solutions but nothing was working. When I was six month old, my skin came back and no one knew why and how, it just happened. I feel that when I was in that spaceship, so vivid, so real, that I just put two and two together. When I was in the spaceship, I was six months old and I saw myself as a baby. I really believe that they were the ones who healed me. From this condition with the black water, people call black goo. It wasn't black goo to me, it felt like healing. More like fixing my DNA. To me, it just felt real and just gave me the answers for something that was a big anomaly and missing link for my own family back in France. When you think about the human reality, it's called the collective consciousness. It's a made up reality that has been designed for us so we can have all those experiences and then die and then move on. But the Hopi Indians and various cultures around the world have those prophesies, like the rainbow prophesies for example with the Hopi Indians. They talk about the time when all the cultures around the world will gather around a circle and recreate a new reality for themselves where the trees can go back overnight. Overnight from seeds. What's interesting about all the first nations and I was fortunate enough to work with a few of them. Where I live right now in Vancouver Island Canada, when you ask them where do you come from? What is your culture, your nation comes from? They said well, our ancestors fell from the sky. They don't call them ETs. They're our star brothers. And we're not different from that, we just forget where we come from. What the Annunaki shared with me was that we are the last form of evolution in the planet. This is the last time they will try to manipulate the human genome, because we are the perfect example of how we can evolve already using those tools combining the energetic world with the physical world. And we can combine that to make up a new reality for ourselves. This is what the Hopi Indians talk about. So, we can recreate reality overnight. Because this is in our power. If we just put all of our minds together, mind over matter is a real thing. This is demonstrated in schools today when they can put up plants, two different plants and by interjecting some negativity towards one plant and love and kindness to another, the one that has all the negative emotions will die way sooner than the plant that has all these positive energies. So mind can impact matter. This can also be impacted from any location. We can do the same thing remotely from 5,000 miles away. That's when we can see that time and space is just illusion. It's got no real boundaries. Over the years, the more and more people I've been involved with, have been confirming what I've been going through, what I've lived through. When Zoar showed up in my living room and said to me that he was part of the Galactic Alliance, this meant absolutely nothing to me. But I came to realize that alliance was a bunch or group of ETs that were working with one another. The human genome, we have our DNA. We have all these components and branches of our DNA that are from different ET races. Like a recipe, basically would have let's say, for me, 75% Annunaki, 5% Draco, 5% Andromeda and whatever it is. You have a different recipe for each. So when people today will say, I feel like I'm Anromeda and I feel I'm Pleiadian, I feel like I'm Draco, I feel I'm this or that. They have a sentiment, they feel attracted to those beings. Well that is probably true. But they also ignore the fact that they are way more complex than what it seem to be. All of these beings are working with one another. The Draco used to be part of the human genome program. Which is why have the reptilian brain and we have Kundalini energy. All of that is affiliated with them. So, it's not all negative. There are some positive components to these beings. But unfortunately, because of their agenda and being as greedy as they are and not wanting to play by the rules, they got ejected from the Galactic Alliance. The duality in terms of negative and positive is very real. And certain factions and forces of ETs will prefer to work towards darkness because it gives an extra power. And we can see that today on planet earth. Those influences exist as much as the positive influences. So, we have access to both ET groups on the planets who are currently controlling us, they are Illuminati groups and the secret societies are working with the Draco reptilians. And I know that from people who are within those groups. The secret space program faces that daily. And again, this explains why so many powerful factions between the CIA, the SSP and the cabal groups that basically are fighting one another on a regular basis. I have worked with people who told me that they went on missions through the SSP and they have met a Draco. They have seen humans in cages. And children. That somewhere used to be fed to Draco as a delicacy. Some for slaves. They are currently working towards a program that's called Immortals. When they want to live forever. It's one of those things that they work towards. I'm talking about people in government who are using those dark energies. The people that form the SSP that went on to fight those groups, I know people within the secret space program that got killed. That never come back from those missions. The way I can do remote viewing, seeing events in other locations, doing remote influencing, influencing people from a distance. All of these things are humanly possible. Everyone can do this. Some can do it with training. A lot of remove viewers out there do it with training. I do have limits like anybody else. But I do remember where I come from. I've gone back to the source, origin of life. I've traveled through the cosmos, I've traveled through the multiverse. It doesn't make me a better man, doesn't make me feel like I'm a guru. I'm just still a human being with an experience. I believe that my role in a small little role in doing this and achieving this is by following the agenda of disclosure. People to realize that they are way more powerful that they are. If they gain control of their lives, of their soul origin, remembering who they are as sovereign beings. Because we're not just puppets of the government and society, we are enlightened beings already. We just have to remember who we are. We can make a change. Eventually, everybody will awaken to this.
