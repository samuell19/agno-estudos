I'll come to every one of your expositions, no matter where. I know you don't like me because I'm gay. I'll see you when I got the time, and now I want you to go. Now. It's a very rare cancer called... If you wait for me, I'll take you there. Don't. Don't follow me. I have my own life. I'd like to invite my friends over for dinner or a movie sometimes. But I can't do anything since you got here. Do you see that balcony? It's lovely, isn't it? Yes, it's pretty. What can people do inside? Running around naked from room to room and making love on the floor. I'm moving in. You can even do the housework when I'm gone. I'll come to every one of your expositions, no matter where. Look, they've almost finished the interior decorations. You told me you preferred New York. What makes you decide to stay here? One reason. You. Hello. Passport control, please. Thank you. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Hello. I'm the curator of the show. - Andre Lowe, nice to meet you. - Thanks for coming. Are you an art collector? Or are you very interested in photography? Yeah, I collect, but on a very private basis. These are very nice pictures, but I realized they are all in color. That's right. This is actually a very special and rare collection. - Is the artist present? - Yes, shall I introduce him to you? - Gladly, yes. - This way, please. Let me introduce you Mr. Alex Lim. Hello. Andre Lowe. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, nice to meet you too. You got some very nice art. - Excuse me. - Thank you. Which is your favorite? I have to say, I think... You. What a surprise. I said I'd come. Look, I'm only here for the evening, so... Can we talk? Okay. Are you still living in that house, with the big balcony? No, I sold that long time ago. Profit of 1 million U.S. Have you been seeing anyone these 2 years? Of course. You know me, nothing serious. How about you? Yeah... maybe even more than you. Tonight, you belong to me. I miss kissing you. Put this on. Yeah? The investor from Beijing has arrived. Do you want to meet him now? Sure. Give me 3 minutes, okay? The investor from Beijing is downstairs. We're gonna be flying to Beijing tomorrow. I'll be back in 3 minutes, okay? Sure. - You're awake. - I want my phone. He called, while you were in your surgery. Someone sent you flowers, along with a card. It's him, isn't it? - Alex Lim. - That's him, doctor. May I speak with the patient privately? Can you wait outside? Sure, thank you. We took this picture during your operation. It should be smooth here in your bowel normally, but it's rough instead for you. Do you see those tiny dots there? They now infest your bowel and squeeze your intestines. It has started swelling and it will block your bowels. It'll be fatal. So what are you saying? It's cancer, a very rare one that infects one in a million people. The medical term is Pseudomyxona Peritonei. Is it treatable? Let's have dinner, son. Stop typing. So what exactly did the doctor say? Nothing, it's just a stomach flu. A stomach flu... Here. You will only have 6 months to live without the operation. It can't wait, and I can try doing it for you. This operation is more detailed than a liver transplant. Do you know how much efforts it takes to remove those tumors as tiny as dust? The operation fee plus 2 weeks in the hospital... The total is $580,000. Have you done this operation before? No, but I'm one of the top liver transplant specialists in the region. I have a free slot on Friday. Take it or leave it, it's up to you. I need a second opinion. Yes, we carry out this operation called Aggressive Cytoreduction Procedure. You joined our organization and asked for a mentor to help through your cancer. So, here I am. Yes, this is Stefen. Are you afraid of death? Of course, I'm just 30 . It was when I had it 15 years ago. I needed to stay in the hospital for 3 months. - Can I be totally cured? - There's no guarantee. You should try natural healing. It's powerful. I've helped many people to survive. It really depends on if we can remove all the cancer. We have to be radical to deal with cancer, don't we? You're still very young, I suggest that you do it. This operation might be the only way to save your life. There are only 2 hospitals offering this operation in Switzerland. Go to Dr. Mohr. He operated on me. He's the best in the whole Europe. I don't entrust you to any other surgeon except him. Hello Lim. Hello Stefen. Why didn't you have any operation? I went through both chemo- and radio- for 6 months. They tired new drugs on me, I was their guinea pig. And I started my journey in natural healing. Did you confirm the surgery? Where are you going this time? I have to go back to Switzerland. A surgery in Switzerland? Didn't your surgeon tell you there was no need for surgery? You're going back just to see him again. Do you think I have no idea? You wouldn't be sick if you're didn't do those kinds of things. People get sick. It doesn't mean that it's a punishment. I know you don't like me because I'm gay. But I can tell you that I'm doing perfectly fine. - I'm happy with him. - But I'm not happy. I'm old. I don't have much time left. I don't even have a chance to have a grandson. I'm not your only son. You gave all your pension to him for his medical school. But he can't be a doctor now. Why don't you ask him to give you a grandson? At least he has a steady life and a stable job. You said you have talents. So I didn't object you being a photographer. But you just take it one day at a time. Do you know what you're gonna do with your life? I paid for school with the scholarship I got myself. I never spent a cent from you. What do you want me to do now? Just tell me. You can't help me. Listen, go to your brother. I don't want anything from him. He's your own flesh and blood. He's your brother after all. He'll take good care of you. The winner of the portrait award goes to Alex Lim. Why didn't you wait for me? What happened? Do you know what time it is? I just came back from New York. I'm tired. I haven't seen you for weeks, and you never answered my phone. Look, I went to the effort to visit your exposition. What more do you expect? Give me back the photo. Give me back the photo. Don't scream. They can hear us. Look, I'll see you when I got the time. And now I want you to leave. No... No, you can't treat me the way you want. You can't call me in the middle of the night, ask me to come over to fuck, and disappear in the morning. What do you want from me? Fuck off! Look. I'll see you when I got the time, and now I want you to go. Now. Open the door. If you don't go now, they're gonna call the police. Don't. Don't follow me. (I am in Bern, are u around?) This is it. The couch is new, so is the bedding. You can sleep here for now. - Watch out. - Sorry... I'll show you the toilet. This way... The toilet is here. The heater control is here. You know how to use the stove, don't you? Should we go out and have dinner tonight? I can't, I have to work. You work so hard. Come on, I need to pay my mortgage. It's a 4-bedroom. It's ready to move in in 2 years. Good for you. I might not be around to see it by then. Stop talking nonsense. You've got a surgeon now, haven't you? He's one of the best. It's gonna be fine, right? I know this place is tiny. It's bad for your health when the two of us are cramped up together. I don't want to give you any trouble. Let me know if it's not convenient for you. That's not what I mean. It's alright. I can find myself a hotel room. That's fine. Dad asked me to keep an eye on you. You can stay here for the time being. I turned on the water heater for you. You can take a shower in 10 minutes. Remember to turn it off after you're done. Electricity is expensive. I have to go. Bye. Hello everyone. This is Jane. First, London's weather. We're having some good sunshine tomorrow. Temperature will rise to 15 degrees Celsius. The cold weather will stay away until the end of the week. Now have a look at the charts... I'm amongst the first patients to have this operation before the year 2000. And it was really a pioneer operation. I was even filmed. Top cameras were rolling on me. They spread my body open like a cross. I saw it. And they invited surgeons from all over the world to watch my operation live. - Were you scared? - No, I volunteered for it. And the one who operated on me was Dr. Mohr. He treated over 1,000 patients after me, so you're in good hands. I may end up with a stoma. But I don't want to attach to a bag for the rest of my life. They always tell you the worst case scenario. They told me too and I didn't get it. Take the operation. You've come a far way. Be brave for it. Hi, we have an appointment with Surgeon Mohr. Room 105. Okay, great. Thank you. Can't you find a doctor in Hong Kong? Why would I have come here then? I already tried to find one there. But how do you know you can trust that woman? Do you mean Jane? She did the surgery 10 years ago. She shared her experience on her website. It's very popular. So how many people have received this surgery? Everyone whose gone through this surgery has left comments on her website.. They're all alive, do you believe it? I can't guarantee that I can remove all the tumors on your peritoneum in the operation. It's a big complex operation of more than 10 hours. It doesn't work to everyone, you have to consider the risk. I will go ahead with the operation. You may not want to hear this, but I think you may even need an ileostomy. If these tumor cells are stuck into your colon, we have to remove all of your colon. If that's the only way to save your life, we have to give you a stoma. What's a stoma? We pull part of your ileum out and make an artificial opening on the abdomen for the output and close up the anus. Most are reversible but some aren't. You can come back later. So it's not urgent? It's a slow cancer. I cannot guarantee one year. But in 1 month or 2 or even 6 months, it won't change. - So what do I do now? - You should think twice. He said you have to wear a discharge bag with a stoma. - I wouldn't do it if I were you. - I am dying! The surgeon said you still have time. You can come back here in 6 months. What if they refuse to take my case by then? He asked me for my insurance record. Didn’t you say you have the money? Where do I get that much money? I had to say that so he'll put me in his waiting list. Why don't you ask the insurance company you signed up with? I need to prove that I've been living here for a year. Can you transfer your bills to me? No, they are all under my name. Can your company hire me? The insurance company will cover it with an employment record. How can I hire you? You don't even work in this field. I'll will be in big trouble if we get caught. Start your own company. It takes a long time. I can't afford to wait. The doctor said you can wait. You were right. I've fixed my insurance after all. I have a friend here. It's not a good time. Go and watch a movie. This is my movie card. Watch 2 movies. It's your photo. They can't tell. We all look alike. Hello Stefen. Hello Lim. Did you confirm the surgery? Yes, it's on July 30. That's very soon... a tough decision. So you see, the doctor gave me 6 months, but I'm still alive. I drink pure water, breathe clean air. I sleep early, eat the organic food that I grow. I keep a fast. I meditate. I get rid of all of my toxins. So You see, It's not necessary for you to have operation. But I've decided to. I understand. So, how about your banker boyfriend? My room key please. Thanks. Hello. Lowe. Oh, yes. It's a very good idea. No, I'll be downstairs soon. Great! See you. My colleagues just called. They're having a drink downstairs. All the bosses of finance are gonna be there. Can I quickly go down and say hello to everyone? Just 10 minutes, okay? Just wait for me. I gotta show you something. This is the house I just bought in Gstaad. You've bought a house there? I've never been to Gstaad. If you wait for me, I'll take you there. See you later. It used to be glacier here, now it's all melted. That's what created all these valleys. You can easily find crystals here. Let's go to the darkroom. - I want you to piss on me. - What? I want you to piss on me, in the dark room. What? I want to be your slave. I don't think it's fun. Come on. I'll meet you in the back. The gear is in the bag. Good morning. Good morning. Breakfast? No... Breakfast. Bye-bye. When are you coming to see me in the hospital? I gotta check my schedule first. Okay, I will visit you after the operation. I promise. Say you love me. You love me. Silly boy. Okay. I love you. Forever? Forever. Say you want to be with me. I'll try. Just try? It's a wish. I live in New York now. You said you are moving back. I gotta stay there for a while. Can you sing a song? I want to listen to it in the hospital. I can't sing. It's embarrassing. How about a poem. Let me think about it. I'll send it to your phone. Can you rub my neck for a bit? It hurts. What's wrong? I have no idea. My body aches all over after my trip. Yeah, your neck is stiff. Hold up. My patients have to make appointments. Please make one next time. Can you take me to the hospital tomorrow? No, I have an appointment tomorrow. I'll call you a cab. No, it's fine. Dad called yesterday. He wishes you luck with your operation. I read your will. You don't have to leave me your money. I'll keep it for your sake, but thanks. However, I might not have time to look for your friend Andre. He promised to take care of my ashes. You have to do this for me. Can he call your hospital? Why can't you just contact him? We'll see. One of my employees just left, so my parlour is a mess. Andre is my lover! He promised to scatter my ashes over the fields. Do you understand? When you recover, you should help us take some wedding pictures. Try to do some video diaries and upload it to the website every day. - How about your honeymoon? - We're going to Rome. - I'm really happy for you. - I won't be here when you wake up. Be strong. We'll keep in touch. You're not going to eat anything for a while after the operation. After you arrive, they will offer you some slimy soup. It rinses your bowel and makes you go to toilet to empty it clean. Then Dr. Mohr will come and mark on your position where the cut will be made. They do it for every patient. That's for Dr. Mohr to place the stoma. Can I avoid the stoma? We'll try not to give you one if we don't have to. The anesthetist will be with you in a minute. It will be a success. Can I ask you a favor? Of course. In case I die, I want to be buried here. I will ask my brother to send you my ashes. Can you just scatter it over the field? Don't talk like that. You'll live on. I know, but can you just promise me? Okay, I promise. And you will live. How are you feeling? Your surgery is over. You've got 90 percent of your cancer removed. - How much again? - 90 percent. What about the rest of it? Your tumors are very extensive. Some of your guts stuck together. The rest are so close to the blood vessel. We can't touch them. Not everyone gets everything removed. 90 percent is quite a lot. But we need to give you a stoma. Is it temporary? You'd better take it as a permanent one. Good morning, Mr. Lim. How are you? How long have I been sleeping? You've been in a coma for 48 hours. Now you're back in your room. Look, I have a card for you. Can you hold it? My phone. Here's your phone, please. Here. Do you need anything else? I'll come back soon. Bye-bye. (Andre: Get well soon, with all my love and support.) Did dad call? Yes, I told him your operation was a success. Did you tell him about my stoma? You should tell him yourself. I went online and did some research. There are many types of stoma bags. This one matches your skin tone, so nobody can spot it on your body. Don't touch my flowers. They are all withered. Just leave them. It's not yours to throw away. I regret having this operation. I was so dumb. You weren't dumb. You were too brave. I asked you to think twice about the stoma. You just didn't want to believe that it would happen. I've lost this battle. So what if you've lost? You just have to get back on your feet. - I know I'm now a burden. - Don't say that. Why don't we get a bigger apartment to live together? I'm sorry, I can't take care of you for a long time. Do you hate me that much? We're just different. You have your life and I have mine. We should get together for dinner every once in a while. So you won't help me? You're the one who can help yourself. Music often transports me like a sea. Toward my pale star, or in a vast ether, I get under sail; My chest thrust out and my lungs filled. Like the canvas, I scale the slopes of wave on wave. That the night obscures; I feel vibrating within me all the passions. Of ships in distress; The good wind and the tempest with its convulsions. Over the vast gulf. Cradle me. At other times, dead calm, great mirror. Of my despair! Around the world, both Asian and European shares are sharply lowered. Asia biggest stock exchanges in Japan and Hong Kong are closed, but every market opened is in the red. India down 5.4 percent, Taiwan down 4.1 percent. Same story in Europe. German shares... What's your name? English? I think we got operated on the same day. What is your name? - Lim. - I'm Pat. Have a seat. How long was your operation? I got 8. 8? I've got 15. So you must be 34? I'm 28. We all have our miracle. We're still here. You're really brave to take this at your age. Who knows what will happen tomorrow? But my tumors are not completely removed. Don't be discouraged. You'll enjoy life as soon as you get out of here. Do you get a stoma? You mean this little hole in the tummy? Not too ugly isn't it? I want my cigarettes. Yours is temporary? Yes, and yours? I guess mine is forever. Take it as a fashion accessory. People don't care. We can't eat, but we can smoke. Feels good. So now we are partners in crime. Partners in crime? Does it look like a crack on the surface of the moon? No. I feel like such a loser. I can't do anything and I have no future. To put it simply, I'm over. Did you take these pictures? Not bad. You should keep on taking them. With these photos, we can put on a show next year. What show? I'm not doing it. What? You agreed to do an exhibition with me next year. I said I'm not doing it. Hey! Stop the car! Stop the car! Hey! Mr. Lim. Hello? How do you feel? I want to check your stoma. Excuse me. Doctor, I need my anus back. Please. You can't be cleared of all the tumors. If we keep your colon, they'll come back. I can't live with a stoma, I'm gay. If we see no tumor cells in your next scan, we will consider reversing your stoma. Okay? If I have a few years left, I would prefer to... Dear Andre, it's been 3 months staying in the hospital. Finally, I am leaving next week. My wounds are healing slowly. The surgeon joked my scar is artistic. Where are you? Dear Lim, When you read this card, you should have been back home from hospital. When you have recovered, we would like to invite you to our house. We should have an early harvest of the organic apples this year. And they will be ready for you. Welcome home! Stefen and Ueli. (Message from Andre Lowe) Welcome on board. You have a whole new department and big shoes to fill. Cheers. I'll be back in a second. Sorry, I'm late. You look good. So how's your recovery? Can we sit down somewhere? Or do you prefer to come over to mine tonight? Look. I'm still stuck in the middle of a meeting. I can wait in your hotel room. Give me the key. This meeting is gonna go on for a while. Is the meeting more important than seeing me? But you promised to come to hospital. Why did you come back to look for me? Have you seen the market go crazy recently? My bank is going to get bankrupt. Sorry about that. Can people with stoma have sex? You can fold it into half like that. But don't ever take it off. Some people just wear it and get used to it. When can I have sex again? Your stoma looks swollen. Your bowel's not settled. Wait another month. It will shrink to a permanent size in a month's time. Your next appointment is in 2 weeks. Jane Maya, come in. Hello, Ms. Maya. Please lie on the bed. Please show me your stoma. You should have asked me before giving my number to someone else. What are you talking about? Who gave your number to someone else? A real estate agent called and asked me what kind of disability I have. I just want you to have a better place to stay for your own health. I'm not even qualified to be disabled. My limbs are all intact. What the hell? You made a mess of my toilet. Can you pay me some respect? This is my house. Can you be a little considerate? I'm your brother. Don't you know what I've been through? I know you've been through a lot, but have you ever thought about me? I have my own life. I'd like to invite my friends over for dinner or a movie sometimes. But I can't do anything since you got here. Fine. I'll move out as soon as possible. I won't trouble you any longer. Don't leave anything behind when you go. Can you give it to dad? - It's fully packed. - Please. Do you really need the wrapping? That's nice. Why don't you keep it yourself? It's a birthday gift. Please give it to him for me. Aren't you having a vacation with your banker friend? No, how do I travel with a stoma? I have a plane to catch, bye. Acupuncture can unblock your veins and arteries. Can it cure my cancer? Legally, we can't say that we can really cure cancer. But acupuncture can boost your immune system and improve your blood circulation, helping you to fight this sickness. Can you come twice a week? Sure. If you'd like to go on with this treatment, can I ask you something more personal? Are you married? No... How about a girlfriend or a boyfriend? None, no one whatsoever. So is there anyone looking after you? Relax... It's okay... Just cry your heart out. Relax... Just relax... Are you Lim? Are you okay? Come on in, have a rest. This is him. Growing herbs. This is a photo I took 2 years ago. He was still strong. There were times he wanted to give up, everything fell apart. But finally, he found his purpose in this farm. Then he helped other people. He had a big heart. Happy birthday to you! Let's blow it out together. No, it's your birthday. Come on. No... You're my partner in crime. - You go... - Come, come, come. Here. For you, please. Cheers. I must tell you, I had a nude photo shoot yesterday. Show me... I've never seen a nude man except Georgie boy in my life. This model is a gay friend I met online. I was surprised to have find him in a group of gays with stomas. I met this guy in a gay bar. I asked him if it was okay for me to take some photos of him. It was great that he agreed to it. In the photo, he presses his stoma bag. I took this photo when I was most depressed. My mind went blank at that time. I couldn't think. But I believed there's beauty in life. I was trying to find my peace in total chaos through this photo. Let's take a look at the next one. These 3 photos are from the same series. I was trying to portray the stoma and the holes in my body. The rest of the photos... Excuse me. What are you doing here? I promised to come to all of your exhibitions. Why didn't you invite me? I can't talk to you now. I can wait. - Is he Andre? - Did you invite him? He's probably in our mailing list. Please ask him to wait for me in the conference room. Okay. Hello, excuse me. This way please. Sorry about that. This guy in the photo... What do you want from me? Don't be rude. I made the effort to fly over here for your exhibition. I don't trust you. What are you here for? I have a... I have a consultant job here in Hong Kong. I thought you are still flying around. No, I'm here now. Maybe we should get together again. Have dinner? No, I'm not free. Look, I still got loads of feelings for you. At least 50 percent... for you. Can't you at least give me 5? No. Nothing at all. Did you ever think of me? I don't believe you. I can see it in your eyes. You still need me. But where the fuck were you when I needed you? Don't you understand what I went through? I lost my job. I went to court. How could I ever face you? Can you forgive me? No. - I've done it before. - Please. Okay. Can I at least get a goodbye kiss? What's that? It's a stoma. Do you know what a stoma is? I guess I do. It's from the operation. Can you take it off? No. Can we have sex?
