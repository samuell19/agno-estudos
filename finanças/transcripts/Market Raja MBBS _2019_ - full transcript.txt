Master, Prepare tea with fresh tea leaves. 'It is for a special person who is an expert in fighting.' 'He can handle any weapon.' 'Watch him if you have any doubt.' He is our hero Marketraja. His actions are unpredictable. 'He is notorious as a fighter.' 'Displays his talent in any settings.' More information about him... "He can kill anyone with one stroke..." He is Das. Market's sidekick. He is Varada, Market's lawyer He taunts everyone. He is Radha. Market's Godfather. Belongs to ruling party. He is minister Ramdas. And they are his henchmen. Minister and Godfather do not get along well. "Still they act as if they are friends." "Still they act as if they are friends." "The list of his actions is long." "Marketraja is fearless." "Everybody fear when he takes out a gun." Who is that? That is for Marketraja. Oh! He has drunk it. Master, prepare one more cup of tea. Whatever I said till now is not the story. The real story starts now. Lawyer Varada! We have appointed you because Marketraja should not appear in court. Why are you giving excuses now? Opposite party has paid huge fees and appointed a senior counsel from Kolkata. What can I do? - Yes. That minister has loads of money. Tea is not good. Sir, I would also like to be with Marketraja. Do you want to be in his gang? - Yes. Get lost. Greetings, sir. Did you indulge in fight early in the morning? Yes. I am fine. But he is dead. Oh! I will handle the police matter. Where should we send the body? Send it to Minister Ramdas's brother-in-law's house. He sent this fellow. Burning candle for that dead man, as always? Whenever you kill a person, you light a candle for him. You murder and then light a candle for the dead. Well done. There are so many candles here. This is for Rickako, this one for Ringako, this one for Padi Suresh. That one is for Kavisiva. Who is this lean and tall person? Yes. It is for Ayanavaram Mynavathi. Are you still sharpening the machete? Hey! Are you telling your wife at night that I scold you? Why? What happened? - Then... I told her to stamp my back to relieve the pain. But her stamping is giving me pain. Idiot! Sister supports our livelihood. Can't you message her properly? - Shut up. Don't shout at me. Never mind. Gopal, who involved me in the moneylender case, called me today. It is 42nd case for me. Better sign now. Otherwise you will die. Note it. Sister... - Do not lick the note. Hey! - Yes, sister... Who spread rumor that ten rupee coin is not legal tender? Now we are getting all the ten rupee coins. Hey! You took money from me. Tell her. Wait. He was enquiring about you in the area. He needs your help. He is a contractor. Come... What is your name? - Nilakandan. What favor do you need from me? Your son Marketraja has been awarded railway parking contract. Has Raja got it? - Yes. Of course. Who else will get? He is my son. I will be happy if I get the sub-contract. Please help him. Kanagasabai is supporting Marketraja. Oh! Is he supporting him? Then I can't interfere. - She is right. Kanagasabai and you (Sundaribai) are not equal. Vasoolraja helped me in a failed love affair when I was young. Now you should help me. Marketraja is your son. He may be a leader but he is your son. You are flattering me. Come here. Will you give me a diamond nose ring that shines like the one in Kalikambal temple? Of course, I will. It will shine so bright that if you wear it and go to harbor the oncoming ships will be confused between the light from nose ring and the lighthouse. - Move! Hey old lady, Prepare crab dish. My husband was working in Court. I have been witness to many cases in Court. How dare you play tricks with me? You... How many people are there? - 12. Twelve? Take Rs 1000 for each person from him. Take. - Sundaribai is very happy that she is going to see her son. I have made crab curry for Raja. The crab was moving till I fried it. It is very tasty. Why are you putting your foot on fire? Did you pray to Goddess that you will do it? Do not taunt me. You are Marketraja's mother. It is a mark of respect to you. Yes. Do not flatter me. How is the 'Ice box' business, which was started in my name, going on? It is going on very well. Sometimes we supply freezer boxes to the persons we kill. We kill and also make money from it. That's good. Who is he? Why is he not showing me respect? He works in tea shop. He wants to join our gang and is behind me. Hey! Show your respects to her. How? Join all the ten fingers and bow to her. That is how she should be respected. - Hold this. She is Marketraja's mother. - Mother! Please recommend me to your son's gang. I am mother only to Marketraj. For others, I am sister. I am still young. - Right! Isn't it? - Yes. Take. - Will you please tell him? I will tell him at the right time. What is your name? Dhanush. - Dhanush! You will become son-in-law to an elite family! Das, order one tea. - Hold it. Anjalai, I heard the news. You love a lawyer. Good. Not me. - I feel shy. You do not deserve. Neelakanda! - Sister... I have prepared crab fry. Tell Raja to eat it. Raja knows how his mother cooks. Sister, greetings. - Hey! Take it. Get lost. Is everyone a winner here! Does the loser pay his money or refuses to pay? Tell me if there is any problem. I am the only mother of Marketraja. Where is Raja? Raja? He is upstairs. Kanagasabai has come. Oh! - Sister, he is the opposite party. My opponent? Come on. Let us go and see. - Okay, sister. Raja! Raja! Is he upstairs? Right. Hey! - Greetings, sister. A big nose ring will suit my face. Right? You will look grand. - Yes. Are you sub-contractor? - Yes. Why? You will not be sub-contractor from now. Dear Raja, are you here? What is the matter? Hey! In which bar are you drinking? Will come in ten minutes. - I slipped. Buy for me. I came to show my respect to you. But why are you beating your mother? My mother! And you? Did you come to show your respect to me? Hey Pattala Sundaribai! I have told you many times not to interfere in my dealing because you are my mother. Oh! It is paining. Is this the way to treat your mother? You did not suffer from delivery pain while giving birth to me. You took pain killers and delivered me without any pain. I breast fed you. Why are you beating me? Did you breastfed me? You made your maid servants to give me their milk. Look, I am not requesting as your mother. I request as Pattala Sundaribai. Give him the sub-contract. I have given word to a person known to me. Do not come here again and create a scene. I will throttle your neck. Get lost. Your hand will pain because you hit me. Massage it. Are you wondering that I am doing freezer business in your name? One day I will send the box to you and take money for it. Why are you going without respecting me? Okay. Go. Sister. - Don't bother me. Marketraja has taken a decision. He will not change it even for the sake of his mother. He is my son. Market, this crab gravy has been prepared by your mother. Sundaribai travelled by boat and caught these crabs from sea. Sundaribai is a liar. She would not have cooked. She is a 'serial queen'. Boss, greetings. I have sold the land in OMR, which you got for me in 2010 for a good amount. So I have sent money in icebox. - You are God to me. Enjoy. Enjoy. Steffani! Steffi! Go inside. Everyone can see your thighs. Go inside. I am sorry. Are you hearing song? - Yes. Which song? BTS- Korean song. Do you want to listen? - No. I thought BTS means the public bus! Our Madam? My Madam. Why did you come here? Do not tell Boss. It seems your brother-in-law Marketraja killed him in public. Look at me and speak. The person I sent was killed by Marketraja. I have just now returned from the funeral. Market escapes every time. Our comrade Radha supports Raja. Who is Marketraja? Move. I will tell her. He is not a good man. He is a wicked person. He is not a hero. He is anti hero. Stop it. He is a barbarian. I like barbarians. Why is she after a barbarian when she has a better choice? Tell her. What do you mean? I mean you are a better person. She made a movie in which she was the heroine. I was the financier. Since then she is with me. I think I have seen her. You would not have seen. Even the teaser was not released. That movie was shelved. This is FM 90.5, for our Medical College. Anyone can speak anything. Now our senior Chandrababu is going to play a love song on mouthorgan. Chandrababu who did you have in mind while composing the song which you are going to play now? Jazz. Please do not ask that. Because your heart beat is the rhythm to this tune. I know it. Do not be scared. I have switched off the mike. Nobody can hear. Tell now. Please leave me. You have to tell who she is. Okay. Promise that you will not tell anyone. I will not disclose the person's name. Vanishri. Our dean's daughter? That beauty? Very good. No one should know this. - Stop it. Nobody will know. Play now. If you hesitate to me how are you going to propose to her? I cannot do it. But one thing. If Vanishri's lips replace this mouthorgan... If she kisses me lovingly... My wish will be fulfilled. My soul will then rest in peace. Get up. Get up. My plan worked out. This is our college FM 90.5. - Go. Go. If you really love me you have to watch the demo where embalming is done. Without fear and with eyes open. There are liquid in body. Will show you practically. Did you see the body? Do you know which sense organ loses its sense last? Ear. - Correct. After death, wax leaks in the body. It will try to protect the corpse from getting decayed. That is nature. But it will not last long. That is why we do embalming. We should insert this tube here and inject the embalming liquid. Doctor, I am able to hear well now. Hey! Chandrababu! - Hey! You are acting as the subject. Should act like that till the end. Inform the accounts department to prepare voucher for me. Embalming dead body. Okay. I will tell them to pay you. - Yes. Muthaiah! - Call me father, with love. Oh, should I! He is a doctor who said he loves you. He is an eligible bachelor. You are eligible. Right? - Yes. You took him to embalming demo and made him faint. It is very sadistic and you need counseling. What? Counseling? For me or for Chandrababu? For you. Nageshbabu you are the friend, philosopher, guide and uncle to Vani. Now your poor girl needs counseling. It is because of you. - There has been not a single love allegation against her since 1st year. Now a doctor confessed his love for her and she made him faint. I will send her now. You love the dean's daughter but you are very timid. What sort of a boy are you? You don't know how to impress a girl. Okay. Did you understand what I meant when I asked if you are eligible? No, doctor. I did not understand. If you are innocent like a sparrow, people will cheat you. By the way do you know about 'sparrow medicine'? Are we going to get this question in final semester? Chandrababu is a coward. He doesn't attend practical anatomy. You have been seeing it since 4 years. Still you scared him. If he takes some drastic step? You will suffer from guilt. What shall I do now? You know how to manage it. Give him a present he likes and pamper him. Marketraja killed Perambuli when I was in jail for 7 years. But you are supporting him. Now that I have come back, my 1st assignment is to kill Market. Then let us work together. Market, we should be together. Mari is coming to Government hospital for a blood check up. Remove the entire blood from his body. Okay. We can take out. His entire blood is bad, Kaduvulappa. Kadavulappa? Kadavulappa! Why are you using a new name? Godfather. Kadavulappa means that. - Oh! You are the God who saves me. Hey! Are you playing hide and seek? She wants to meet you alone and so she has invited you. Go. - Yes, the same person. You are in 1st year. Right? Yes. Go away. Come on. - My respect to senior. Run. Run. - All the best. Kick him out of the campus. Two girls elope with a young boy. - Chandrababu! We both are seniors. He is after all a 1st year student but he is ragging you. You are a coward. Chandrababu, I am not teasing you. I want to make you feel ease. Play it. Do not play a love song. It sounds horrible. Play some other tune. Power cut. It smells like a dead body. Let us show light from mobile. Bad smell. Hey! It is a male corpse. Hey! Hey! Oh, God! Help! Oh, God! Help! He is hitting us! Don't come near. Will kill him. Go away. Blood will ooze out of his neck. Go away. As a doctor I have seen lot of blood. Done many operations and seen death. I have cut human bodies while studying. MBBS degree cannot be obtained easily. The operation knife is here. It can cut a body easily. Will do it very smoothly. I don't know who this doctor is. I will attack you whether you kill him or not. Will give you a chance. Leave this place. There are cameras all over. The body of a person they killed has come up for postmortem. They want a certificate saying he committed suicide. They think doctors are timid. No. I will join another hospital. Vani! Thank him. Thank you, doctor. - Alright. Kaduvulappa. Yes. Job done. But Guna and Jabamani escaped. Well done. You are my outsourcing son. But I am a devil. Bye. I will come. Eat well. Okay madam. I will keep it. Hey! Come. Food. - I have eaten. It was neither spicy nor tasty. College canteen. What is it? Should I check her? Is it paining? - No... Should check your BP. Come to hospital. - Alright. You can get the check up done for free. Okay. Doctor has told me. Are you able to hear her calling your name? She is asking if I am able to hear you calling my name. She is very happy that her son is studying medicine. I have got information that vigilance people from All India Medical Council are going to make a surprise visit here. So be alert. Do not sleep. As you usually do. Go. - Okay doctor. Yes, doctor... - I am not a doctor. A don! - Don? Don't you understand? Dada. Dada? You must have heard of Market. No. - Then hear it now. Radha is on line. Yes, Ms Radha. Sorry. Sir... Sir, how can I do it? Sir... It is atrocious. He is telling me to mark the extra corpse in the mortuary under Sec 174 as unclaimed corpse. I killed that person. Sign here. Okay sir. We will do it. Sir, will you please extend my term as dean? Okay, sir. Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. I am not saying that I am an honest dean. Political pressure. Sundaram! - Yes, doctor. Sir, greetings. - Okay... He is Perambur don. Is it? - Yes. Give this in office and take his sign! Get lost. - Okay, doctor. Don, my foot! Doctor, wait. Doctor. Red signal to us! My fellow lawyers are jealous that I am with you. They are trying to jeopardize my career but are not able to do. Oh, God! I got you, doctor. Why are you dashing the car against a stool? - Move. Thank God. No. Thank you, signal. Do only boys fall in love at first sight? Even girls can fall in love. I liked you the moment I saw you. She is irritating me by calling me doctor. Why don't you give her injection and send her off? If a person who can hold a knife and cut is a doctor then even I am a doctor. Do not irritate me. A girl is considered cheap if she proposes first. Who is that? Get down. I will taunt you if you mock me. Correct. If I love you, even you will love me. We should kidnap her. You come in Scooty. Injection? - Yes. Right! Wait. She is Anjalai, our security check-in. Lift your hand. You are touching her more than a man! Leave it. Is she the girl about whom Market told us? Go. Good. You have dressed up appropriately. Have you touched her? Go in. All of you get out of here Guest has come. Go. Yes, it is a girl. Go away. Hey! Hello! Sir, the Ice bar will melt in half an hour. You will get only that much time. Doctor! - Suck his blood. He will die. He will die. - Hello! See here, Doctor! Hello! Hello! Please help. What happened? The person who filed case is dead but the case is still there. See who has come. Subbaram! It seems you left our collection department. Brother, I draw well. I have now joined an art college. I draw well. Can you draw me? - Yes, brother. If your picture of mine makes Das and others to respect it. I can do it. - You can do whatever you want. But if you do not draw my face properly you should be in collection. Draw. - Okay. I will pose. Is it okay? - Yes. Please do not kill him. Varada, check whether he has drawn properly. I have finished. How is it? He has drawn very well. Looks exactly like Market. Does it look like me? - Brother! No... Does it look like me? - No. It is You. Varada! Your taunt is also realistic. Your eyes look as if you are staring at me. Shut up. See the painting and say. Painting is over there. He is original. - Both are same. It must be right if you say. et me kill him. No! Oh, God! - I said something is missing. Tell me whether I should kill him. Say. - No! I will shoot him. - Brother! He will kill him. - Shoot! Saved one candle! Come. Let us go home. Shall I smoke? This is real comedy. It was really jovial 'After many days the cinema setting is going to be let out.' Doctor girl, say now. Am I a doctor or a don? Are you thirsty? Are you feeling hungry? Yes. You must be hungry. Only then you will understand. Varada! - Yes? Who am I? Real dada. Don with ISI stamp. Did you hear? I have railway contract. The entire area is afraid of me. Loving a rowdy can happen only in movies. Because the real hero goes back to a bungalow after shooting. Das, tell her the fate of the Marwari girl who loved Kumar. He died in the 3rd month. He was killed in public. She married in January and lost her husband in March. That girl did not go back to her house. She is with me now. Is that why you are speaking hindi? Yes. Can speak well. Even I need a girl. But they are of different type. I will call over phone and they dress up and come to this terrace. They lie on me and drink liquor. And they leave at night. Because they look horrible in the morning! Send her home in Scooty. Check whether she reaches home safely. She is from an elite family. Not suited for me. She thinks I am a doctor. Get lost. Hello! Can we eat an ice cream photo? You are like that. You are an ice cream photo. Cheers. What? You have come for counseling. Do you love a don? What is wrong? I love this don character. He says he doesn't like me. I like his honesty. Has he told that he doesn't like you? But I like him. What? Mr Nagesh. - What? You should not tell this to Shivaji. Please... Sula Jabamani and Guna. What will you drink? I have liquor. Duty free. Shall I ask him to get? No need. Instead give us poison. Poison! Stock over. Boss, our parties have the same ideology. Only our physical appearance is different. Do not say poetry. Looks like you just missed it. Not just missed. We just escaped. Oh! Heard that your Minister will also be sent to jail. Who? Ramdas? - Yes. He will never do it. Tell him to die. The person who came to kill us is Marketraja, your favorite. Do you say I planned it? I only cut the nails. Even we mean the same. We are nails and Marketraja is your flesh. Come to the point. Got information that Marketraja is going to celebrate his birthday. His birthday should be his death day. We need your permission for that. I will not permit it. Tell your minister. Oh! You mean you will not allow your flesh to be cut. You said so. We survived with great difficulty. You will not speak like this if you had escaped attempt on your life. I like a chasing person more than the person who is running. Useless fellow! If you disobey me and plan to kill Marketraja I will inform the Home department to kill you in encounter. We understand. We will leave now. - Yes. We will not kill Marketraja now. The place of his birthday celebration is area between two police stations. We are ready to kill Marketraj at the right time. Okay. I will speak to commissioner. Hello, mike testing. A rowdy sometimes becomes curious. So I act as if I am dead to have that feeling. Every rowdy has a history. Even I have. History of don. Shall I say? Once upon a time I was left floating in a boat in a drain. He came floating. I was roaming without a penny. He stole the whiskey bottle at that time. Come on! Come on! I was 10 years old then. He was smart at that age. He sold others properties... - And amassed wealth. I was an ordinary person then. Now... Well done. Continue... I was eighteen. - What happened? I was attacked at that time. - Continue. I fought with them and drove them away. He turned and saw a girl. He saw her. She left her husband and came to him. Hey! I was an ordinary person then. But now? Continue... Continue... Continue... I was used to killing people by the time I was 21. Started earning lot of money. A girl entered my heart at that time. - Wow! "She was very beautiful." "Suitable for me." I told her that I love her. I gave her a rose expressing my love. And she accepted it. Suddenly another man entered her life. And I was heartbroken. Get lost! When I walk people used to get scared of me. Enemies come near me with fear. I lived as I wanted. I became a don. Where are you? Inspectors, where are you? Come here immediately. Over. Over. Over. You both wanted posting in a station where you can get more bribe. I helped you get millions of loan amount from Nathuram Seth without interest, for the kickbacks that you had to pay. But now both of you have not repaid even a penny to him. Shall I tell one thing? It is not my birthday today. You were in a hurry to target me without checking the police records. I tricked you to come here. You used political pressure to nab Marketraja through Police. Marketraja! Now he has got hold of two inspectors. Hello, who is that? - Mudi. Some Mudi is speaking. Hello, Minister Ramdas speaking. You are a big shot. Why do you want to speak to me? You are acting high handedly. Release the inspectors. Then come and see me. We can discuss and solve the matter. I have a meeting in half an hour. Minister, come to spectrum mall terrace, if you have guts. We can discuss there. The police matter will leak out if you do not come. I am sure you will not come. What is he saying? He said he will apologize to me if I go to spectrum mall and release the inspectors. I will come to the meeting directly. You go. Alright, sir. Come in time. Lots of things to discuss. Go! Minister, come here. Come here. Have you seen the movie where the hero and heroine get trapped in lift like this? "He should be borne again to do it!" Where is Marketraja? He is up there. Climb through the ladder. This is the symbol of opposition! I will not use it. Marketraja! I am getting late for the committee meeting. Come down fast. He will not answer. You join hands with any party if you want. Climb the ladder. Oh! Have you hid the phone? Wait and see what I do. Watch it. It is shaking. Shall I hold it? What? - Ladder is moving. Shall I hold it? Marketraja! How dare you? Are you behaving highhandedly because of Radha's support? Are you playing politics with a politician? I was running a cycle shop in my initial days. Cycle chain was my first weapon. I was a notorious rowdy even before you were born. Listen! Release the inspectors. Okay, sir. Das, release the inspectors. Minister has come here. Is it okay, sir? That is good. - Oh, God! Tell Radha not to come in my way. Drop him and join me. You will be more powerful. I have to go now. Bye. Where is the ladder? I want to get down. Your discussion has been a failure. Stupid, give the ladder. Minister! Have you finished talking? Come and sit here. Let us come to the point. You pay 60 million rupees which the inspectors owe. Then you may go. Hey! I have got committee meeting now. Do not play with me. Brother, catch. Good catch. This is not a game for me. It is my job. Why did you interfere in my work? Take your phone. Call someone and tell them to bring. Steffani, it is me. RD speaking. Yes. I want 60 million rupees now. It is urgent. It is in the numbered suitcase. Send your man. She will give. Steffani! The name sounds romantic! Steffani! Steffani! Tell her to bring the money here. She will not come. Will tell her to send through driver. No. I want Steffani. She should bring. Hey, Marketraja! Which is more important? 60 million rupees or should Steffani bring it? Do not waste my time. I am not wasting the time. You are wasting. Don't you have meeting now? You do not want me to see Staffani. Right? Okay. I will cover my eyes. Steffani! Steffani! I cannot see you. It is my fate. Oh, God! Steffani! Steffani! I am sorry. Extremely sorry. - I will not say sorry. Can we go? Yes. Only you can go. Marketraja! This is my trick. I am unable to see Steffani. You please go. It is time for your meeting. Boss! I told you. But you did not listen. Why have you come late? I said we have problem. But you did not listen. You have been removed from the minister's post. CM told you to meet him in party office. 'So we hereby inform' 'that no one should approach him for party matter.' 'If you disobey action will be taken by the party'. Please come. - Sir, please come. Please come. - Bless me. Please come. Play music. Sir, please come. - Please come. Play music. May you lead a good life! Thanks brother. Take. Take. Godfather, you are my life. Thanks. It is because of you. - You have multiplied my earnings. You said and I did it. Well done. Play music. What is it? Useless fellows. You have brought shame to the department. - Daddy, time? 9.7, dear. You may go. Meet me after your suspension period is over. Home secretary is presiding over the enquiry. Till then take care of your kid. Now get lost. We are not able to handle an accused officially. What sort of a police are we? But Walter... - Sir, I am not an unworthy commissioner. Wait and watch. I have a plan. Walter! - Sir. Can you identify him? Manohar Singh the great encounter cop of Jharkhand. Police academy is full of his laurels. Correct. He is my friend. He was enjoying his retired life in Jharkhand. I called him secretly. Manohar sir! You have to encounter Marketraja secretly. If we include his name in list we are forced to remove it because of political pressure. He has Radha's support. He has used Minister Ramdas and so he lost his post. He held our inspectors as hostage. Shame on us. That is why we want you to kill Marketraja. He is Walter and he will be with you. - Sir. Oh! - Greetings, sir. Marketraja! - Greetings, sir. Das, you may go. I have some personal work with Marketraja. Come. - You go. I called you here in private. Even sent out Das. There is an important reason for that. This is my hotel. Come in. Sir, I will be here. Go down and sit near the security camera. I have some secret information. If I am your Godfather, you are my Godson. I have amassed land, bonds and wealth of around 5.5 billion. I suspect there will be a raid. I have put everything inside a Benz van and parked it in hotel basement. I will go to Dubai return after ten days and take them. Alright. - Hey Marketraja! Let us have a secret code word. Liquor. Okay? Liquor? - Yes. It is simple, like in movies. It is between us. Entertaining word. Liquor. Liquor. Okay. Marketraja! It is my life! Be careful. New furniture is being unloaded. You were missing the whole night and have come back with a sofa. Why did Radha call you? Oh, you want to know! He has not seen metro rail. So he took me. Then why did he send me out? Even I have not seen metro rail. From where did you get this sofa? It is for me. Hey! Get up. - Don't shoot. Who is the boss here? You or I? Are you a great lawyer? - Wait. This was gifted by Steffani. Nobody other than me should sit on this. Nobody should even touch it. Alright. - You better understand. Steffani's sofa. Here is your daughter-in-law. Welcome doctor. She said that you love Raja. Is it so? No... Yes. I can't express it. Shall we talk about marriage or love? Oh, God! No. I will not marry immediately. Oh! You want to mingle and then marry. Yes. I want to see him, mingle, understand... That's right. He will not refuse me. Alright. Alright. Let us have a deal. What will you give me if I tell him? Give you? Will you give me 12 bangles, 6 bangles each for my hands? Okay. I will give you 2 bangles in advance. Take. Hey! Prepare crab gravy. I will go and meet Raja. My dear! Is Raja there? No. - No? Give that. Yes. Do you know that doctor girl? Yes. Raja had locked her upstairs. You should not disclose such things. That girl loves Raja. Look, I have worn the bangles. So you do one thing. You tell Raja about her so that he starts loving her. Tell Raja that I came to give this crab gravy. Alright. - Now it is your game. I drove out that girl. Why do you want to help her? How much money did you take from her? I will hit you. That girl is standing outside. Do not talk about love. Tell him to beat me without making noise. Alright. - You will listen only if I thrash you. Okay. I will not make any sound. Will you ever do this again? Will you ever do this again? - One, two, three... Can you bear my slaps? Raja feels very shy. Nobody has seen him feeling so shy. But... - But? He has some hesitation. He is worried about the difference in status between you. He asked whether it is possible. Why not? Come. I will speak to him. - Wait. 'Love' is new to him. But I told him that love happens without caring for status. It is like a small child on a mother's lap. I told him that he is your love. What did he say? He said he likes you very much. But asked you to wait. He will make up his mind and then start loving you. Please tell him to look at me and say that he loves me. Don't bother. This is not a cinema. Everything is okay. Come on. There is a 4 storey building in Perambur. The owner dances with film actresses in TV. Let us go and see. - Sundaribai is a liar. Look how she bluffs! No one will respect her if she doesn't talk like this. But I feel pity for that doctor girl. Why are you singing this theme? It is irritating. It is my feeling. He says it is for his lover. You are in 1st year. Right? Instead of ragging him, why are you ragging me? Go. Bye. - Get lost. Get lost. - I will go. Are you angry with me? If you had attended the intern surgery properly you will not blabber like this. Many lovers are in love without attending it. How is it? Heart is the basis for love. Bloody heart. If a person watches a heart surgery and still falls in love, that is true love. When a rowdy, who kills others, falls in love it is true love. Will you love only if I attend it? You will never understand. Do you have the guts to see the birth of a baby? Okay. I challenge you. Can you stay fearless in a graveyard at least for ten minutes? You are a coward. 'Can you stay fearless' 'in a graveyard at least for ten minutes?' Why are you worried? This is the graveyard which your lover mentioned. You should stay here for one hour playing your mouthorgan. We will take a video of it send it to your lover and prove that you are not a coward. What do you say? - Oh, no. Please. I will not do it. How will your love be successful if you do not do it? I will attend surgery. Watch childbirth. But I cannot do this. Please. Oh, God! What have you done? My princess gave it to me. Where did he throw it? I am scared. Please come. Many people are buried there. They are with you. All of you search for the mouthorgan. I will go now. Bye. Hello, Bashir bhai? Tell me. Hey! Hey! Das, where are you? They are shooting me. I am in the cocoanut grove. In the graveyard. Hey! Who are you? Will kill you. Doctor! Doctor! Help me. Help me, doctor. He is a civilian. Medical college student. college student. Cross fire. Don't know why he came here. Both of you leave that place. - Okay, sir. Hold on the operation for some time. - Yes, sir. I will take care. Marketraja! Chandrababu! You have left us and died! Did she educate you to see you die so young? Your mother used to serve food to everyone with a smiling face. Vani! - Yes, doctor. We are releasing the body after post mortem. Police formalities are there. Formalities will be over only tomorrow. Please tell her. They will now handover his mutilated body. Can you bear to see it? She can't even speak. Forgive me. Please... Market! I have brought breakfast for you. Call Guna and Jabamani. Where are they? - Will call them now. It was planned by Guna and Jabamani. You escaped by a whisker. They are calling us there. - Let anyone attack us. Let any number of people come and fight us. Marketraja can fight all of them single handedly. Will come... - They are shooting at the back. Let them face us boldly. - All of you will be killed. Tell the priest to be ready to do your final rites. - Right! Come. Let us fight them. Kill them. Come there and show your anger. Varada! - Yes. They both have come with the person who has lost his power. Still he is sitting like a powerful man. We will get Steffani today also. Market can enjoy. Yes. - I will go first. I will come if you cannot handle. I said I will come with Market. Market, your presence gives us courage. Look at the way Das is walking. Like a lion cub! How dare you? Are you planning to kill Market? Now Marketraja has come here to kill you. You are trapped. Why are you hiding behind a useless person? Who is the useless person? I do not want to insult the ex-minister by mentioning him. Say and then see the consequence. Guna! - Shut up. Get up. Is anybody providing free meals here? Get lost. Look, you are attempting to kill him. I warn you. Do not do so. Today our fate will be decided. Market has come. If you were not here these two would have been killed by now. Das, see who is standing in front of you. Tall fellow! What do you say now? - I know. Market will start fighting if he sees anybody harming me. Today it will be decided. Das is in danger. How dare you attack me? Go. - Market, go. Are you seeing how many persons are there? All of them will die if you start fighting. Your lives are in danger. - Hey Das! Oh, God! I got scared! Did you think I will be scared if you come with an ex-minister and suspended policemen? Market! - Come. You will dead today. - Market! What are you staring at? Do you consider yourself a rich person if you stand under a umbrella? Wait and see. - We should not fight with other boys. My mother will beat me. Will any mother give money to her son to fight? You beat your mother. Do not play tricks now. Get down. All of you will be killed. Let us see who wins. Do you think we will be scared if you come in a big car with that useless man? - They will be holding knives. I will not go. What? Scared of knives? But you have gun. Take it out. Market will come now and there is going to blood everywhere. All of you will be killed. - Brother! I told you to take out the gun. Why are you taking out the mouth organ? What happened to you? - Will you kill me? Kill. If they decide to kill you they will stab any part of body. Not only chest. He is showing off his chest size without knowing the actual position! Ask Market to come. Market! What is this, Market? Get down. Go and do something. Send him. - They will kill him if you do not go. Market will ask for Steffani. What will you do then? Think about it. Kill and throw him in drain. - Do not believe these two people. Let us go back. - Come out. What is happening? I am scared. Das, come here. Send Market. Sir, think about it. Market may get down any time. Take care of Steffani Madam. Das, spare some time. Come here. Leave him and come here. Okay. Nobody should move. I will be back in two minutes. - Come now. We will decide today. What is Market saying? - Some problem. See there. - Uncle, I feel scared when I see them. Uncle! - He called me 'brother'. He is blabbering. Come out. Say that he is suffering from fever. Take some time and come back. I have already told them. We should never be over confidant. Manage somehow and try to escape. Who is calling now? 'Sir, do you want to take life insurance policy?' 'We have many offers.' We are going to die in 5 minutes. Will you give insurance policy? Hang up! Hang up. Market says that since you have bothered to come you can handover any one of them. What do you mean? Sulai or Guna. Handover any one. We will kill him and go. Because he doesn't want to kill both. Think and say. We will go home. What nonsense are you saying? - Don't worry. We will wait. Think and tell. What happened? I have put him in a fix. We can manage for now. - Okay. Guna, you are the right person. You go. Fool, you are also one of the two. You also go. Sacrifice your life. You go. No. You go. You go. - No. I will not go. Who is there to serve our leader if I go? Sir, I bow to you. Tell him to go. You go. You go. I am there to serve Boss. - You go. Hello, have you decided who will die? We can decide later. Tell him to go. If you want, Market will get down. - Not now. No problem. He will get down even now. - Go. Stop the car. Turn. Do not underestimate us. They may turn and follow us. Press the accelerator. We have escaped death. Please do something fast. Temperature is abnormal. It is fluctuating. Palpitation is more. I have never seen like this before. - Even we have not seen. I will prescribe a medicine. Buy it from counter. Okay, doctor. You will not understand it. Give it. I will bring. Only the people in medical shop can decipher his handwriting! Doctor, you have prescribed me Paracetamol tablets. Please suggest me an injection of Acetaminophen which is also a Paracetamol. Speaking in English! Since it is intravenous, it will be much faster. Something like... Yes. This will do. He used to talk a lot. Now he is playing a violin! It is mouth organ. - I don't care. He is definitely not Marketraja. A dead person is sitting inside him and playing mouth organ. - What? He has been possessed by a spirit. Otherwise why will he address as 'uncle' or 'brother'? You found him in graveyard. Right? - Yes. A spirit has possessed him there. Spirit! Oh, God! I normally sleep here. How do I sleep? Where will be head? Your head will be here. Then my chest is there... - Shut up. Oh, God! - What is it? I saw Market. Have you never seen him before? But I have never seen him like this. She looks happy. What is this? - Anjalai has seen. Uncle, this is not mine. It is very big. Is that why you removed your underwear? Yes. - You... Wear it. - He is grown up but no brains. Wear it. He is not ashamed at all. Shameless fellow. If they know that Market has become a coward they will kill all of us. Even our boys should not come up. Only you, I and Market should be here. Anjalai can give him food with her eyes closed. Yes, madam. Go to market and get me some things. - Okay, madam. While returning, go to super market. In that market... No... Go to hyper market. Why the hell are you talking about 'market' always? Your market is down now. Do you know who is responsible for that? I am going to kill Market. Your hands will pain! "He can fight anyone who attacks him." "He is the King of the entire area." "Do not dare to fight him!" "He can fight any number of people singlehandedly." "Was he attacked in the mortuary?" "He is a notorious fighter." "Marketraja is capable of fighting anybody." "He is a rowdy." "Is a good fighter." "Do not try to cheat him." "He will kill you." "Do you still have any doubt?" "He became a don because of his fighting ability." Hey! Deliver water can and go away. Do not stand here. Come on. Get out. Do not scratch the sofa. Everyone was scared of Market. But now he has been possessed by spirit and become a coward. You don't worry. There is a person who can cure him. There is an exorcist named Kalavathi who can do it. She is best of all. Congratulations, Kalavathi! Congratulations. Wish you a happy married life. Call Gunaseelan. Come. Wish you a happy married life. It was like a scene from Gautam Menon's movie! - Yes. Ms Kalavathi your cheeks were like apple when we started loving. Has it turned pale now? It is like an orange! - Oh dear! I feel shy. Now I am going to kiss your cheeks. That is why we are going to a resort. - Oh, God! Dear, we have a private swimming pool in that resort in ECR. Really? But I do not know swimming. I will teach you. - Okay. Do you know how you will look in swimsuit? Talk softly. Driver and cleaner can hear us. They will feel jealous. They are still young! - You are driver and I am cleaner. Driving so fast! Sir, we have reached the resort. Alright. Come baby. - Come dear. Bring the luggage. - Okay, sir. Come on baby. Dear, what is this? This is spa. They make us lie down give steam. - But spa looks small. They have made it small so that we couples can lie close. - Naughty boy! Mother Sundaribai. Mother means 'Thai'. Must be Thai massage. Oh! I love Thai massage. - Yes. Come dear. This place is so romantic. Doesn't look like a reception! We are Mr and Mrs Gunaseelan. Give room key. Give. Oh, God! Heard that Marketraja is a devil. Has another spirit possessed him? Why have you come to us at this time? Yes. Look... - Hey! Sir, we are '96 batch. We were in love since then and married only now. Isn't it? - '96 batch? Which school? Not school. We completed MA in '96. You are not newly married couple. You are newly married old couple. Understand? Sir, you will get better people than me to drive the spirit. Moreover latest expensive equipments are in my house. So we will complete our stay in resort. We will stay here comfortably and then... He is possessed by love. First I will cure him and then drive the other spirit. Okay? - Okay, dear. Do not waste your energy in hand shake. I am improving my energy. - Varada! Is this your equipment? Oh, God! How did you take it from my house? We broke the main door and searched in hall. Broke two wooden cupboards... Then we broke the cot. This was in that. Oh, God! Have you broken the cot? What is your decision now? Okay. We will drive the spirit fast. Okay. - Let us start from here. Okay, dear? - Yes, dear. The resort, swimming pool, me and the spa will wait for you. Cheers. Why do you look sullen? I am in my 40's. Loving her since 30 years. We decided just 3 days back. And we got married 3 hours back. We were in full mood. You spoiled it. Tell your wife to drive away the spirit. We will send you back to the resort in 3 hours. You can enjoy. - Spa! How can she drive away spirit when it is not there? There are no spirits in this world. Don't you believe in ghosts? None in our family believe. Shall I tell 2 stories? 1st story. There is a dilapidated bungalow in my native. Look, he is scared! It is a belief that there is a ghost there and it will kill the person who stays there for a night. My father went to the bungalow when I was a child. It has been 30 years now. He has still not returned. Do you know it? Is he staying there for 30x365 nights alone? Continue. Listen. There is a vampire in a well in our native place. People say the vampire will pull that person's leg who goes there to take bath and kill him. But my brother dived into the well. It has been 15 years and he has still not come. 15x365 days... He has been in water. - Yes. With courage. - Yes. He dived into it. You are shocked. Isn't it? - Yes. How will he believe in ghosts? Who is coming there? Your wife or ghost? "Ghostbusters!" She looks like the heroine of a movie. Right? I think she looks like a pesticides sprayer. You are jealous. - Shut up! This is a ghost detector. - Okay. I am a ghost jailor. In which room is the ghost there? - There. "Ghostbusters!" Dear, God bless you. I will come back dear. - I am waiting. Say whether you won or lost. Varada! Go and see. Wait. Market has been possessed by the spirit of Chandrababu, a medical college student. It communicated with me. That night... Market was targeted but a doctor died. Yes. Has that boy's spirit entered Market's body? The subconscious mind of Chandrababu spoke to me. It has put Market's soul to sleep and this boy's soul is awake inside him. Is this Sandwitch made with souls? Keep quiet, dear. Sorry dear. The irony is that the boy doesn't know that he is dead. - So? Ferocious souls try to come out of the body with force. But this boy is a coward. So he has stuck to Market. You are an expert exorcist. Drive away the spirit. Is it a bike that she can drive it? Dear! - Sorry. Mr Das, I will chat in Skype with our Ghostbusters club members and find out a remedy for this. It may take a month for that, isn't it dear? - Maybe. Sir, we will celebrate our first night by that time and return with a good idea. Okay? Let's go. - Hey! if it becomes public that Marketraja has become a coward we will be killed. What can we do about it? Drive away that spirit handover Market to us and then go. Till then you will be our guests. Varada, take them to the 1st night coupe. Go. - Hey! Have you seen Karate? What did you say? - I have watched in TV. Go. You will have to stay here. Vani, what are you doing? Did you see Market? Saw him walking fast in anger. I thought someone is going to be killed. Didn't you go with him? Varada! Varada, Market has escaped. We have lost him. - Oh, God! Let us send our men to the usual places where Market goes. Okay. - Yes. Hello, instead of searching for Market search the places where Chandrababu frequents. Then? Medical college. You will be hit if you do like this. Understand? Hello! We are just kidding. - You are hurting me. Please do not tell him after he recovers. He is beating me. See what he is doing? - I was angry and so hit him. He is beating me because I went to college. Market has thrashed me before for letting go two cases. Then? - Let me also beat him now. Will hit you. - Oh, God! You are hurting me. Will hit you. - Oh, God! Why so much noise? Market has been awarded Arakkonam railway contract. That is why we are going around. That's good. Feel like puking. Some bad smell. From where is it coming? Look at that haughty lady. Bullet lady! See this side. You should not smoke here. You are arrogant. Do you think you are a famous hero? One more person wearing a Lungi! You should not wear Lungi for college. Oh! He is removing it. He is taking it out. He has removed out. How dare you talk to Madam like that? - Why should I care? The whole area of Perambur is scared of her. Is it? Do not lie. He knows your real status. - Hey! Who are you? What is your address? Nagesh Babu, 2nd street. I asked for address but he is replying like a song. Song! When I said Margabandu 2nd street, you said it is like poetry! Hey! - Yes. That doctor girl is coming. Go and meet her. Hey doctor! Wait. Stop... Hey! Turn right. Sister wants to meet you. She has come. - Hey doctor girl! You dare to challenge me. You must be very daring. You took Sundaribai on the other day to convey your love to Marketraja. Yes. But how did you make him love you now? I will take you to Marketraja's house tomorrow and put bangles for him. Wait and see. Bangles for him? What will my son think? Won't he mistake me for pledging him for the sake of 12 bangles? I will not come there. Will not come. No. You will get bangles only if you come. Sister, you should not go there. Let us solve it here. Do not leave this place without bangles or the equivalent money. Is it? Then I will make Marketraja come here. And I will put bangles for him here. Do it. He will come and hit you. Then you will run away. I do not want bangles. A mother is acting like a pimp here. I am dean's daughter. The entire college will surround you on my orders. Either you come to Marketraja's house or I will make Marketraja come here. What do you say? - Let him not come here. I will go to my son's house and take it. Okay. You can go to study. She has cornered me. I have driven away many violent and fearful ghosts. But this coward spirit is posing a challenge for me. How can she drive away a spirit which is not there? I will prove it now. Are you cheating others by showing this as a machine which drives away spirits? 4 million Youtube views for this! Where is it? You will take this skull. Be careful. - Then you will hit the head with this weapon. After that you will murmur something and keep it on ground. Then you will switch on this light. - You will look at this. Then you will hold it like a pesticide sprayer. Show it here. Then show it there. Then you will see whether the ghost is here. Then... - Have you done it? Okay. Continue. - Yes. Look at this doll. It is like famous singer Michael Jackson. Then you will hit both the dolls like this. Will the ghost couples come as soon as you do it? Do not cook up stories. Is this the ghosts' Wifi? Will a person who died in railway track come back as ghost if I hold like this? Tell me. Is it 4G or 5G? Can we see ghosts with this? You can see the ghosts as well as hear them speak. Wear it. - Let me check whether I can see. Where? Oh, God! I can really see the ghosts. I think I will die. Kala, please drive away the ghosts. Please... I have not bought the equipments for that. I cannot drive away the ghosts which have come. Adjust. Ticket... They are actually dead people. Where is your ticket? - My ticket? Yes. Show it. - Move. Buy fruit for me. - Please buy ticket for me. Tell your name. What is your seat number? Show ID. They are yet to get it. Kalavathi! Hey! Do not look up. Bend down and walk. Why is he walking like this? Do you think they can drive away the ghost? They cannot do it. No use. We can send them for their honeymoon. Das! What? - Sundaribai is coming. Oh, God! All of you show respect to me. Wait. You be here. I will go in. Why? I will also come. - No. You should not come. I will slap and scold my son. You should not see it. Will you slap him? - Yes. He told me to wait a few days but started roaming with you without informing you. I will scold him. But nobody should see it. You stay back. You come. - Wait. Your mother is coming to meet you. As soon as she comes, give her a tight slap. Okay? - It should be painful for her. Okay? - Poor lady. No. I do not slap anyone. He talks as if he is a very good person! - Hey! Do as I say. Right? Go... I feel scared to see him. SIster! - Oh, God! SIster, go. - Go, sister. Go. - Go, sister. Don't stop. - Go, sister. Go. - Go, sister. Go. Sister! - Oh, God! No. Mother! Where are you going? Come here. Go. The two persons who are with her are dangerous. They will tell everyone about him. Raja! Are you my son? No, mother. I know it. Doesn't a mother know her son? Hey Das! Do you think I do not know anything? Don't I know? - Yes, sister. I know what has entered my son's body? Sister, how do you know? - Do not act in haste. Love has occupied his heart. Are you hiding it from me? Even a tiger becomes timid if it is in love. Super! You are capable of joining CBI. Hey doctor girl! Hi! - He feels so happy. Doctor girl! - What? You said you will give me bangles. Come... Come. - Why should I come? Come. Put it for her. Hey, come and see this. What is happening here? Baby shower for Sundaribai! Nonsense. Sundaribai has become emotional. See this. Bless me. O My God! Doctor girl! Will you save me if I something happens to be out of joy? Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Hello! Tell me. - Radha sir is coming. What? - Radha sir is coming here. Radha sir is coming here? We are finished. Godfather? Oh, God! What to do now? - Where is he? He is studying. Can you perform operation after reading it? Trust me. I am a junior doctor. You didn't know English. - Lift him. Sit. Oh, God! Welcome, sir. - Welcome. Greetings. I am coming straight from the airport. Bought duty free liquor. Foreign liquor. Enjoy. Thank you. Liquor. I want to speak personally with Market. Go. You coward! Do not speak unnecessarily. Keep quiet. Do you understand? Hope you were not troubled by police of minister when I had gone abroad. When are you going to return my things? Shall we go now? One minute... What happened? What? The new sir... - Who? M.R Radha. Okay. He wants back the liquor which he gave. We have opened and drunk half of it. We have already drunk. - Tell him. He is our man. - Okay. Tell him that you will keep the liquor. Alright. Hey! Why are you walking like a coward? Walk smartly. Go, sit cross legged and then say. Smartly means? - It means... Hold the shoulder high. Go now. How is this? - Go. He is very innocent. Go. - Okay. Let the liquor be with me. I have been observing that your behavior is not right. Do not play tricks. I am a wicked person. Liquor is mine. Return it back. Shall we go? One minute... Why have you come back? Uncle says it is his liquor and wants me to return it. Why is he behaving like this? He is so cheap that he wants back the liquor given by him. Why are you addressing him with respect? Don't do it. Do not address him with respect. Alright. - Yes. Convey as poetry. Okay. Listen now. "What belonged to you yesterday..." "What belonged to you yesterday..." It is mine today. It is mine. "It is mine today." "It is mine today." Bhagwad Gita preaches this. Bhagwad Gita preaches this. Go and tell him. - Okay. What belonged to you yesterday... - Hey! Come here. - What uncle? Come here. Give him this snack instead of liquor. How is it? What belonged to you yesterday... It is mine today. Bhagwad Gita preaches this. I wanted my documents. Are you insulting me by giving this snack? How dare you play tricks with me? You might have changed. But I am still the same person. Government is in my hands. I will shoot you. - Hey! Sir! Don't do it. Sir! - Leave me. Why are you trying to shoot him like cinema villain MR Radha? Drop the gun. I may not be the villain. But definitely he is not MGR, the hero. He is cheating me. Like a villain in cinema. My liquor. Liquor... Liquor... I have favored you by removing your name from encounter list many times. Think about it. You should come to me and return my things. What is he talking about? I don't know. How will he know? He is actually Chandrababu. Hey! Where are you? Drive straight. We have to go till canteen. Go. I can go even till Delhi if you are sitting in the back. Why are you asking me to stop here? Wait here. I will meet mother and come. Meet mother! - Yes, my mother. Mother... Hi! Madam! Hey! What happened? Who are you? What s this, Mother? Mother! Hey! Who are you? - What mother? Who allowed you inside? - Get out. Mother. Open the door. - Get out. Mother. Mother. - Get out. Why are you suddenly angry with me? He is calling her mother. Mother, open the door. - Get out of here. Get out of here. - Why is mother inside? She is not your mother. I understood. - Get out. Mother is angry because I have come with that girl. Let me explain. Open the door. - Get out. Mother. - Will you go or shall I call the police? Get out. Who are you? He is not going out in spite of telling him. What work do you have here? Kick him out. Come out. Why are you playing music? - Wait. I am sorry. I am sorry. I will not play. Madam, your son is playing music. Give him sweet. Please do not cry. Latha madam, your son is not dead. You don't worry. I will convince mother. Okay? Market! Go away. Go. They are crowding around him. Go away. You have dressed up as if you are attending an interview! Looks like you know the truth. Why have you tucked in the shirt? We are scared that our entire gang will be wiped out. Where did you go without informing us? Untidy your hair. I feel tired when I see you. Oh, God! Are you sick? Give me stethoscope. - He will die. Let me check your full body. Okay? Hey! Market is talking in a weird way. Market is talking in a weird way. Come to hospital tomorrow. We will get you admitted. Come. - Take care of your health. Hey! I feel happy that Market cares for me. - Go inside. I knew just now. You have a serious problem. Both of us want Marketraja. Take proper care of him. Let me go. You believed Sundaribai and are roaming after him. Where is he? How dare she advise me to take proper care of him! Let me go and see him. Hey! Why did you go to college? - Oh, God! Please sir... Okay. We will meet after tea break. Hand over this in office. Nagesh, you sit. - Why? Okay. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. - Thank you. You come. Vani's classmate. - I know. Sobha! - She is Deepa. Deepa. Tell him about it. Marketraja entered the class room in search of Vani. We got scared. He sat with us. He was also wearing coat. They were speaking in the class. Yes. We saw it. Marketraja sat in Vaani's scooty and put his hand around her. Enough. Did you hear? Your plan did not work out. I am upset. You were telling about some 'Syndrom' and told us to wait. What to do now? He is getting closer to my daughter. He holds her with both hands in scooter. - Nagesh! Oh! Shivaji! I will not bother if she had loved a doctor. You want me to love a doctor. Right? This is a good chance to make my love a success. Come. He killed a person and forced me to sign that it is an unclaimed corpse. Bloody rascal! - What did you say? Is your work over? - Doctor! Your lover Gayatri is waiting. Go. - Gayatri! It is different type. Do not bother. Shivaji! Nagesh! I am going to tell a secret to you. We have seen a don becoming doctor in movies. Yes or no? - Yes. It is actor Kamalahasan's movie. We both saw it. But in my case a doctor has become a don. What nonsense are you talking? Yes. Marketraja is a doctor. MBBS. Wow! This is medical miracle. I will not accept it. - Yes. I want to know the college where he studied the year and his registration number. What is his UPRL? He studied in Russia long back. He has to clear a few papers. So he cannot start practice. In the meantime, his personal life was affected. Twist and turn. He became a don. Oh! The great history of don. Though he appears to be a notorious don. He is actually a doctor. A doctor must be respectable. But he has become just the opposite. - Nagesh! Alright. I will agree that he is a doctor. Show me his certificates. Why do you want to see certificates? Then you will say that it is fake, bogus or morphing. Be practical. Conduct an exam. - Exam? You be the examiner and evaluate his paper. No! Let Nagesh correct. We, students, will also write the same exam. Just a mock test. Done. It is Don. Not done. Nagesh! - What? I know. - What do you know? Such persons will not write the exam at all. Yes. Be serious. Okay. Serious. If he fails in his exam you should stop loving him. Deal? - Deal. Marketraja! The question paper should be so tough that he will never come back here. It should be so tough that even we will fail, if we write the exam. Nagesh! - Yes, Shivaji. I want cream of professors from all over the world except Russia because he studied there. Let us get question papers from all the medical colleges in the world and select questions from it. I want... - Shivaji! I will do as you say. Hey! Pay money and leave the place. Tell Market that I told him this. I have received some important information. Tell me. Manohar Singh, an encounter specialist has been asked to kill Market. It is a secret. What? He is Manohar Singh. He is an expert fighter. He came to supply water can to our shop. Let people know about Market's courage. There is a way. We have to kill the encounter specialist. But nobody from our gang should do it. You should do it. Kill the policeman. You are now one of the members of our gang. His behavior has changed after getting a post in gang. Good morning, doctor. - Okay. Good morning, doctor. Sit down. Sit down. Good morning. - Okay. All the best. For exam? - For the result. For love result. Nagesh! - Yes? Why are you wishing her unnecessarily? He is going to fail. The paper will be easy for you but difficult for him. It is a new technique. Yes. Hi! Mr Russian doctor! You should not shake your body while writing exam. Sit. It is time. Take the paper. Yes. Time out. - One minute... Time over. - Hey! Time is up. What is the result? 34% Oh, God! 34%! Marketraja has failed. It is your daughter's score. What? How much has he scored? 94%. How is it possible? I do not know. - How is it possible? Check. Check. I told you to set paper for MBBS. But it is set for MD, higher standard. Latest nuclear medicine. Even I do not know it. - But he knows. 94% I have passed. You are not a don. You are a doctor. She is asking about the convocation date. Who are you? Do not come. - Wait! Sir has called us. Come. Boss! Boss! CM is sitting upstairs. Members from Delhi have come. There is a secret meeting going on about coalition. Media doesn't know about it. But everyone knows that you are a cheat. Avinasi - Yes, sir. Show the poster to Das and Varada. Yes. Election has still not been announced. Have you already printed posters? Hey! - Hey! Tearful tribute to Marketraja. Marketraja is dead. From Das, Varada and people of Perambur constituency. Our name is mentioned. How is the poster? I am going to paste it in the whole area. Sir, please do not act in a hurry. Yes, sir. Marketraja... Police and rowdies may be scared of him. But I am Godfather. Godfather. King of master plan. Sir... - Hey! CM is there. - We really do not know about the deal between you and Marketraja. He is a strong guy. Doesn't reveal any secret. Okay. I will tell now. It was cash, documents and papers worth 5.5 billion. I told him to keep it safely without informing you. But he has deceived me. Let me think about it. That day he left you and went with Godfather. He returned back in the morning with this sofa given by Steffani. Then he must have gone to Steffani's house. Isn't it? - Yes. There is only one way. Let us take him to Steffani. We can find out the place where the documents are kept through him. Where is Steffani? Sit! Market! Yes. Steffani! The other day I gave you something to keep safely. Where is it? What are you talking about? Where is it? Market! I have been yearning for you. You did not come to me. Why are you asking when you never came to me? Das! No connection between Steffani and the treasure. Never mind. I am that treasure. Take me. Come on Market. Take me. I cannot forget the terrace. Terrace! Madam, please leave me. I love Vani, daughter of dean of our medical college. Market! - Please do not touch me. Market. - Market? I am Chandrababu studying 4th year MBBS. In Government medical college. Vani! Vani? - I have lost my honor. Market is a coward. Why are you all calling me 'Market'? Vani! Is Market possessed by some spirit? Stop there. "Shivoham!" "Shivoham!" There are two souls in his body. One is sleeping and the other is hiding. Do you understand? Yes. The soul has not attained peace. "Shivoham!" I will be in graveyard. A Puja for God Ashtabhairava will be performed at 2 am Bring him there. - Okay. The soul will attain peace. "Hail Lord Shiva!" "Hail Lord Shiva!" Good time has come. We will get back our Market. - Right! Our problems will be solved. "Shivoham!" Come, Ramdas. You spoke to my guru in Varanasi. I will obey the orders of my guru. Tonight the soul inside him will be freed and he will also be killed. I will come to your house at dawn. Alright. Alright. There should not be any trace of Marketraja afterwards. "Shivoham!" We are Agoras, people who eat humans. We are very hungry. We will devour him. Hello! - Is it Vani? Has dean started? Yes. I have some important information about Market. Come. Get down. - No! No. - Get down. Come out. Come. Listen to me. - No. Come. Come. - No. Come. Come on. - Come on. Take him. No. Oh, God! Wait. "Shivoham!" Market is getting hurt. Do not pity Market. It is Chandrababu who is being beaten. He is getting beaten. Das! Take away Market from here. Please... Keep quiet. Do not irritate me. Please listen to me. - He is driving away the spirit inside him. See. This person has been sent by Ramdas to kill Market. - What? Steffani called and told me. Please save Market. Das! - Go. Hey! Das! Das! - Oh, God! Das! Wait... Vani, he is beating me. See, there is blood on me. He hit my legs. Tell him not to beat me. Please tell him. - "Shivoham!" Tell him not to beat me. 'If Vani's lips replace this mouthorgan and I get a kiss' 'my wish will be fulfilled.' 'It will release my soul.' Chandrababu, are you satisfied now? I like you. Your life is over. Know it. Go away from here. Please go away. 'Princess.' 'My princess.' Market, have you woken up? Who sent you? Come... Lord Shiva has woken you because I should not fight a coward. Come. Come. Vani, he is Market. - HIt him. Don't spare him. You go away from here. - No. I will not go. You should not stay here and see this. - Go. Why? Varada! - Yes. I... - You can meet him tomorrow. Go now. I want to see Market fighting. - Come on. Go. Market! "He is an expert in fighting." "Can handle any weapons!" "Do you still have any doubt?" "He is Marketraja, the don." Who parked the Scooty there? Who is that? - Das. Still not got collection from Malladi. Ask him to come. Yes. I will go now and tell him to come. Why are you staring at me? Have you not seen me before? - Greet me. Hey Das! Why has she come here? Ask her the reason and send her back. Why has she come here now? Market! - Oh! Have you come again? I have warned you to leave me and go. But you are not listening. You will listen only if I treat you like Sundaribai. What is this? Who plays this here? Where are our boys? - Boys, come up. Call and find out if Godfather has returned from Dubai. I misplaced my phone. Come here. He saved my life yesterday night. Stay here. Stay with me. - Okay boss. He was asking about 'liquor'. Why did he tell you about our private deal? Why is she standing here? Tell her to go. Get lost. You all go that side. Know one thing. The real reason you are alive is because of her. Do you know what happened to you? Poor girl. - Das! Stop it. Whatever I told to Chandrababu suits me also. A one sided love is not love at all. It is just a crush. I thought the recent incidents happened by fate, for my sake. No. No. These incidents happened for the sake of a poor dumb mother. I realized it only now. With great difficulty I took permission from my father that Market should attend the convocation. But it will not happen. A person lost his life because of my mistake. I have atoned for that sin. I am always an 'ice cream photo' for you. Bye. He said... Father. That's the doctor who got 1st rank. I do not do such things normally. But a part of the person inside me is making me do it. I will take care of mother. Where is doctor going? He is not a doctor. He is a don. - I pity doctor girl. Sundaribai is responsible for it. Das, tell Sundaribai to come home. Godfather! Your treasure is inside the sofa. 'Well done.' 'Continue...' 'I was eighteen then. - What happened?' 'I was attacked at that time. - Continue.' 'I fought with them and drove them away.' 'He turned and saw a girl.' 'He saw her.' 'She left her husband and came to him.' 'I was an ordinary person then.' 'But now?' 'Continue...' 'Continue...' 'Continue...' 'I was used to killing people by the time I was 21.' 'Started earning lot of money.' A girl entered my heart at that time. - Wow! "She was very beautiful." "Suitable for me." I told her that I love her. 'I gave her a rose expressing my love.' And she accepted it. Suddenly another man entered her life. And I was heartbroken. Get lost!
