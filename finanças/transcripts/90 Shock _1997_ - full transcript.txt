Since she's not joining us tonight Seven at night, she's going to be there She's crying after I scold her - I'm used to this already - Goodbye, free food - It always ends like this - I've waited for weeks You're all about free food It has been 2 months, and you still haven't caught this guy The commissioner asked me every day for a report You two still dare to tell me that you've got tricked by a ghost? And what's this? Did you dye your hair? I see, is it a trend? - I've been haunted... - Shut up! Enough! Don't you ever speak of such nonsense again But inspector, we've seen it Enough! I'm your commander You may only speak 3 words when I ask you Yes, yes and yes - Is that clear? - Yes, yes, yes Yes, yes Yes Sergeant! I give you 48 hours If there's no update on this conflict you two are going to be in real trouble Sergeant Sommhai Did you know that last night your nephew brought this story - to the radio show 90 Shock? - Did he? You listen to it too? Yes. But yours wasn't that scary compared to the story of the haunted police station Nonsense! Go... get out of here Yes, sir What are you looking at? Lek, did the manager call for a meeting? I heard that it was going to be about 90 Shock Man, I feel like Pong is going to be in some trouble Yes, I knew that the show is coming to an end Pong never trusted anyone about this I thought so too When did he come? Must have been really awful if I'm unemployed at the age of 30 Don't you worry about it, Pong is a very talented guy He can always find a new job Doesn't matter how talented he is being unemployed at this age could surely break a person - Isn't that right, Pong? - Why are you asking me? I'm just asking Let me read it for you We have always love and respect you don't you ever give up You won their heart and soul I wonder if I was in your situation would I receive as much love as you did? Pong, Chai, it's time for the meeting Yes... I just need to go to the restroom first Such a pity Are you so afraid of being layoff? Best of luck Why are you looking at me? Why? - Ong shouldn't have loss - I knew it Only if he had to practice a little more Yeah, look at him now dropped down from the top - Why? What's wrong with that? - What? - Who were you gossiping? - Pong is getting out of control - I'm losing my job, so what? - I wasn't talking about you I was talking about Ong Liar, no need for an explanation A girl like you two watching snooker? I heard my name clearly You must be real happy that I'm getting kicked out Here's your wish card, you can take it back I wasn't talking about you. Here, look. It's live right now You think that I'm stupid? White down? Ong fainted! - Pong, get in the meeting right now! - Yes... manager But I really need to go to the restroom first Not now, I need to talk to you about lots of things But I'm having a really bad stomachache Don't make me wait Can I please go to the restroom first? All right... I think it can wait We've all seen that the rating of 90 Shock that Pong runs has been dropped to the lowest point. Just look at the graph here I think that the beliefs of Thai people have changed Like many others scary talkshow they've all been shut down Manager, I really have to go to the restroom No! If the rating isn't getting any better to the point where there's no sponsor I can no longer let you run the show And I would have to give your hour to Love Boom instead But, I think... ...isn't it too fast to decide? Shouldn't we give him another chance? What's that smell? No idea, sir Pong, I'm giving you 1 month Find a way to fix it, if you want the show to continue Isn't a month too short, sir? I think it should be 3 to 4 months or maybe a year? I promise sir. I only need a week 90 Shock rating will get better Pong, why are you saying such things? I'm trying to help, why would you... I don't need your pity. I know what kind of a person you are What kind of a person am I. Say it I would never be as bad as you are in your program Chai... Who took a dump in here? All right, enough for today Manager, Pong's fart is worst than yours Where's the toilet? I can't hold any longer Oh god, it's coming - What are you doing here? - You pervert! Get out! How is this happening? You pervert, why are you in here? You were going to take a peek at us or what? I didn't know it was a women's toilet Don't lie, look at the huge sign here But how come that guy can go in? That's a girl? You pervert, don't act stupid! You pervert, is that all you can say? You better watch yourself before this tomboy rapes you Darn it. Luckily you are not a guy What a sweet pie, she is my type You look familiar, are you here alone? Oh, I remember. Lin, you're Lin, aren't you? No, my name is Meiji That's right, Meiji. Now I remember You think I'm afraid of you? I'll punch Meiji, don't you go near this creep this freak of nature Stay with me here. I'll protect you So you like this tomboy type. These gay, lesbian and all weird people Fine, do whatever you want, but trust me they're all freaks Who are you talking about? Guys, I haven't eaten anything since I got here Look at Tong, she just kept eating and eating Tong, shouldn't you wait for the birthday girl to come first? I have got to hurry since Tui might not be treating us At least can you chew softly - Why? - I can't hear the music... - ...over your loud chewing noise - You crazy - It's good that you're eating so fast - Why? The taste and the texture don't last that long Stop looking around and enjoy the moment Joy probably won't be coming. Let's have a toast Celebrate the broken heart - Our friend is heartbroken - And we are so full Let's dance guys, let's dance Girls are always like this When we take good care of them, they pretend not to care about us - Have you ever had a girlfriend? - Yes, I used to have one But she left me Why? She asked me to take her to watch a movie so I went even when I had a diarrhea I did everything for her But when I need to use the toilet, she was so angry at me She was probably worried that she'd missed the movie? No, she felt embarrassed What's to be embarrassed and please let's just stop talking about poop She felt embarrassed because I pooped right in front of the cinema Then she left me, she didn't really love me You pathetic You shouldn't tell anyone about this I'm sure that Joy really dumps you this time Have you done it in front of her? - I can't take this - Where are you going?

It has been told not to Remember, when you enter the orphanage whatever you see, don't say a thing Wait until you come out first - Do you understand? - You! - Go, let's go - This is life and death You can't be joking about it. Like in the night time if you hear someone calling when you're alone - Do not respond - Why not? Because they said that the souls, the spirits are calling for your life and take you with them Don't believe him. He's in depth right now so he's been using this trick all along I see, that's why he never respond when I call Come on, it's fine if you not believe Like the place that we're going they're incidents about the death of these orphans It has been almost 10 years ago How? I remember that their supervisor locked the kids up because they were so naughty And he forgot about them. Once he remembers - it was already too late - Oh dear Well, this is how it goes nowadays They have kids, but don't have what it takes to raise them So, it becomes a problem in our society I really hate guys that ditch girls after a night with them Kids ghosts are a lot scarier than any other ghosts If you see them, do not interact Because if you do, they might want to play with us and a lot of people have experienced an odd and unexplainable stories Why did you stop the car again? I... Don't! Don't you mention it! Don't! Please don't! Trust me, please don't say a thing - I need to pee - Don't... Don't say it, just hold it for now Hurry up and go Really need to pee!
