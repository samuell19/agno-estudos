All the best. All the best. All the best. - Formula One style. - No, fuck off. It is, mate, isn't it? It's lovely. - Where's the sword, the scabbard? - The scabbard. - Is it a twister? -Is it? - Who's got a tea towel? -Goon. Come on, Noel. Oh, you dirty bastard. Where's the scabbard? Go on, sit down. Get in there, City! - It's having it. - It's testament to your manhood. You've fucking set the stall out now, haven't you? Go on! Come on. I know a geezer who can do that with his eye. Go on, Phil. A dual fuck... A team effort. You do that side. For fuck's sake. Where's my scabbard? Go on. You do it. - He's got it. Yeah! - You drink these every night. A Newcastle and my usual. He's got a tankard that fits all that in. A Pete Beale tankard. "Get out the way," he says to me. "Get out the way." - Why don't you get out the way? - I'll just loosen it for you. Give it a shake and then it'll fucking pop. - Go on! - Don't do that! You'll bust it. - Nearly there. - Come on, you fucking cunt. [FUCKIN IN THE BUSHES] [LYLA] - Can I speak? - I don't know. OK? OK. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Liam Gallagher! Liam, we're here to talk about your new LP. Is it the cover of your first...? That? I think that used to be our original backdrop. I think that... - It was the demo. - Yeah, the first demo. - The cassette, yeah. - The cassette. Can I just point out that's not the actual cover? The cassette wasn't that big. You'd need some fucking serious tape recorder, wouldn't you? How distant do you feel now from that cassette? It's just there, isn't it? It was over, maybe, 11 or 12 years ago. On that cassette is Rock 'N' Roll Star which we still play and we played only last night, so we're still connected to it. Just sort of play on it a little bit. Are you all right, Noel? You all right there? Losing it in his car. We don't fucking spend all day there like a lunatic. I'm not too worried... Good wink there, Noel. Do that again. - No. - No? This is going to be the glorious start. - Here we go. - Yeah, here we go. Yeah. Who are you fucking looking at, you little bastard? The glorious return. Fuck off! Which one of you wants to go next? All right. What are you looking at? Who's that? Fucking Girls Aloud? How are you doing? Nice to meet you. - Hello. You all right? - Nice to meet you. Are you OK? - All right? - Good. How are yous? - Good. - All right. - What are you doing today? - Showing how it's done, man. We've got a gig tonight. - Where are you playing? - Astoria. - I wouldn't mind coming down. - I can't. The tickets are all gone. I'll get some for another one. I'd love to. Do you play any old stuff? - All of it, man. - I was singing it last night. I'll get you some tickets for the Hammersmith. - I'd love to. - That would be great. Get in touch. We'll sort it out. Nice to meet you. See you later. [MORNING GLORY] Flight BA107 to Berlin is now boarding at gate six. What about the cliché of sex, drugs and rock and roll? Is it still something to believe in? I didn't join a band for drugs or sex. I joined to make music. - Sure. - I hope so. You hope so? I joined a band for sex, drugs and rock and roll, especially the sex and drugs. I didn't even want the fucking rock and roll. I just wanted the sex and drugs. Fuck the fucking music. I'm not making a record. I just want to get off my head. So, how would you rate your new record? I reckon it's up there with Definitely Maybe, if not better. That's not saying, "Don't buy it." Buy it if you want to buy it. If you don't buy it, don't buy it. I don't give a shit if you buy it. I'm not saying it's better than Definitely Maybe for you to buy it. Do what you fucking want. You never seem to care about being liked by your brother. Why would I care? He loves me, he's my fucking brother. He doesn't have to tell me he likes me. I know he loves me. I don't have to tell him I like him cos he knows I love him. Do you guys still need the attention out there? Yeah. As soon as I walk out, I'm going to knee someone in the nuts so I can get in the paper for tomorrow. OK. And Madison Square Garden, is that still ahead? - Fucking is. - Are you a bit nervous? - Are you ever nervous? - No. I was nervous when Ringo turned up. Nice. Here with Noel Gallagher of Oasis. Obviously, you're the better guitar player. Who's the better singer? I've heard you sing. He's got the best voice. I'm the better singer. Since we're talking sibling rivalry, who is the ass-getting machine of the Gallagher boys? - That's him. - Really? You guys look so alike. What is it about his game that puts him over the top? - How does he get the women? - He's the singer. Singers get all the girls, is that your understanding? - Are you married, Noel? - No, I'm not. What's your approach with the ladies? Do you even have to tell anyone at this point, "I'm from Oasis"? Well, I'm in a very stable, long-term relationship. I can only tell you what it was like when she met me. She came up to me in a nightclub and begged me to go out with her. "For the love of God, give me a chance!" What was the one show that you did where Liam, like, walked off and they had a camera on him and he's booing you as you're playing? Did you yell at him afterwards? That was MTV Unplugged and he'd been out all night the night before. As the guy's introducing us, telling the crowd to go wild, he goes, "I'm not going to do it." As the guy goes, "Oasis," "I'm not going to do it." "I've got a sore throat." So we all go out and when you watch it, it's unrehearsed. It wasn't planned. And then he ends up in some box up in the thing, heckling, which was nice. And if you say how special this is for you to be playing the Garden, you might be playing it alone? He wouldn't leave me there to steal the glory of Madison Square Garden. He'll stick it out till the bitter end. - Really? - Totally, yeah. He'll do his big B-boy stance at the end. You can't get tickets for the show. I don't care, I've got my ticket. The things I have to do, eh? KY fucking jelly in the ears, eh? Eh? Fucking Jesus Christ. - It's fucking cold. - Isn't it? It'll be freezing on stage. - Are we all ready? Noel? - Yeah. Yeah, we're going to go. - Are we going this way? - Yeah. [CIGS AND ALCOHOL] - I thought it was great. - A real pleasure. I'm warning you, I'm going to get fucking plastered tonight. We went down to see the Statue of Liberty today. [LET THERE BE LOVE] Oasis! Yeah! I'm with Liam Gallagher. How's the tour? Are you all getting along? Tour's great, man. The only problem we've had is Noel's had the shits, so I think we've turned the corner. It's going really good, man, for Oasis. - What's it like being Liam? - It's great, really good. Amazing. What makes it so great? It's that I'm alive, man. That makes it great. I've got two beautiful, healthy children, a beautiful girlfriend, all my mates are healthy and everything's good. - Has life changed dramatically? - Not dramatically. It gradually gets better and better. Slowly but surely we're getting to places we're meant to be going. Yeah, I wanted to ask how the wife was, really. My wife? I'm not married. - You're not married? - No. I thought you were married. How's the other half then? Sarah? - You know I'm not Liam, don't you? - Yes. Yeah. Listen, she might be blonde, Noel... You know that game Shag, Marry Or Push Off A Cliff? Ready? - Charlotte Church? - All three, I think. - In which order? - We all have our sexual preferences. I'd push her off a cliff first. Then I'd shag her and then marry her. - Is your mam coming tonight? - She is. She's out now selling tickets out the front, T-shirts and that. A bit of touting. Are you writing songs at the moment? Yeah, we've wrote a load of songs. We haven't wrote any this week. We wrote a couple last week. - 80, you write them all the time? - Yeah, all the time. I can't stop. [LET THERE BE LOVE] That was fucking good, wasn't it? Are you ready? Lights, camera, action. I love that. Does it stop when you do that? - Fucking gay thing. - I'm not gay. It was Hollywood. All right. Lights, camera, action, you fucking knobhead. Great time for the band. It's only dawning on us recently what a great year it's been. I'm glad this has come at a time when we're old enough to appreciate it. Like the year we had Morning Glory, we were just too young and mental, and I can't remember any of those years. '95 and '96 are a complete blur. We're in the Hollywood Bowl, which is a famous LA venue. I wanted to ask, do you think LA is a wank? [LORD DON'T SLOW ME DOWN] Without being a pissed-up prick, I just want to say thank you for letting us. Thank you for letting us do that. That was incredible. Sign that for Zak. Put it in there. - You want to sign it? - Cheers, man. Really. We were buzzing our tits off tonight. - We were fucking buzzing. - I could tell, man. - Sign it. - What a card. - It's Zak's 40th. - Yeah. Mine's not till May, but seeing as you've bothered. Thank you. Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! I want to ask you first, Noel, this song Cast No Shadow, and I'm asking you for the first time, written about Richard Ashcroft? - No. - No? - Dedicated to Richard Ashcroft. - Dedicated to him. How did that work? Because I wrote it at the time that Richard and The Verve had split up for the first time. - Right. - It was just to big him up, really. It's not about him. - It's a homage, I guess, yeah? - That's not the right word. It's like when you dedicate a song to somebody at a gig. That was for Richard. Cast No Shadow... He's so skinny it seemed like... The reason why one would cast no shadow is because one would be invisible. OK, that makes total sense. What do you guys want to play next? It's a song called The Importance Of Being Idle. » THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING IDLE "I'm 46 years old." Lunatic for starters, right? It's saying, "Could you please play at least one of the songs I requested "and just for a moment tell the lighting guys "to put the lights on my seats, numbers 16 and 17, row I? "And maybe I'll ask my wife to stand "and you can recognise us as the long-term, number-one fans. "Everyone says I'm the biggest Oasis fan in the world. "I bought quite a few tickets for those less fortunate than me "to see you, Noel, on Monday night and tonight." "Love one another, right?" "Anyway, thanks for reading this and it will mean everything to me "if you could please keep me in mind. Your number-one fan, Tony Jay, "11th row, centre orchestra, row I, seats 16 and 17. "Please, please, please. PS, can I have a picture with you?" 46. You've got fucking better things to do, haven't you? [THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING IDLE] Do I get one in the leg? Stick with that. You know where you are with an extremely large orange. [ROCK 'N' ROLL STAR] I had a fat-Asian-bird phase, a ginger-bird phase. A skinny-bird phase, a fat-bird phase, a fat... a fat ginger... a fat skinny ginger on acid. I think you just tend to go for what you've not got at that moment. - Maybe. - Don't you? I've had enough of this skinny fucking cunt. I want a big fatty, so watch it. Juicy, aren't they? The fat ones are more juicy. Is this for the next front cover of the album, is it? Oh, for the Q Awards? Yeah, I'm over the moon, like. I don't pay attention to Q magazine because they're all cunts, but the people who vote for us, they're nice people, fans and that. I couldn't care less about any magazine in England. They're all full of shit. But if we've won something, I'll turn up and collect it and make a spectacle, you know? And if we don't win best live band, then it's a fucking fix. There's lots of bands, but the ones you said, Scissor Sisters, no, I'm not having it, I'm sorry. I'm sure they're all nice people, but fuck them and fuck Bloc Party and fuck Pete Doherty and his stupid mess, and all the rest of it. And Franz Ferdinand, they don't do it for me. They've got every right to slag my band off, which I'm sure they do. I don't like electronic music, I like rock and roll. But I think, one second, I think these people take it a bit personal. It's not like I'm saying, "I want you to get hit by a bus tomorrow." I wanted to get out of where I was instantly. It doesn't mean to say Manchester. I mean the place that I was in wasn't a nice place. I had no money, I was skint, things weren't going well in my personal life. I wanted something to happen and if it meant being successful, I can handle the success. It's only the miserable people and the fakes that moan about it. I've never moaned about it, you know? I'm in Denver with my mates in the Red Rocks, having a laugh. There's beer on tap and beautiful people around me. I don't care, man. It's a fucking great life. Thank you very much, man. Bye-bye, bye-bye. Bye. Fuckers! [BRING IT ON DOWN] Happy birthday, Liam. Ain't no time, it's birthday time! What a legend! So it's your birthday, ain't that grand? We're presenting the cake at hand. Rock-star groupies in a jam. Move on over because we're the plan. Look out Jagger and the Beatles and Duran Duran. Oasis are the future and this is the plan. Have a great trip in the land of Japan. Happy birthday, Liam, you're the man. And Denver is pretty rad! Nice one. Thanks a lot, man. Can't you have a fight or something? Come on! [LIVE FOREVER] They got the arse with Scully. He was referring to them as midgets, which they don't take kindly to. They're little fuckers, aren't they? Give us a squeeze, you little bastard. Hang on, that's where Kennedy was shot there, look. - He was killed in Dallas. - You can go in. That room's all glassed off. You can go outside and stand under the window and go, "Not a fucking cat in hell's chance." Here we go. Come on, City. Doncaster win 3-0 on penalties. City are out the cup. They missed all three penalties. Hit the bar on all three? Doncaster fucking Rovers. What division are they in, the cunts? [REASON IS TREASON] Thank you, Dallas. Thanks a lot. - Tom Cruise is a fucking cunt. - Midget, he's a midget. - Fucking, I... - You know he's... by the way? It's all... No, I've got nothing against.. .people, but he's hiding it. He's a little fucker and he's not been in one good film. - What about Cocktail? - Cocktail's great. - Eyes Wide Shut. - I fucking... I hate Tom Cruise. He's a little shit, isn't he? Bastard. Him and Michael Owen. Fucking cunts. [COLD HARD BITCH] The midget. That is the best, the best one I've ever seen in my life. When she said, "I was in Star Wars," I went, "You're pulling my leg." - She was an Ewok, so was he. - Fucking Jesus. - I watched War of the Worlds. - Any good? It blew my mind, mate. Spielberg, he's on it, mate. - He's a fucking geezer. - I've read three reviews. - What have you heard? - It's shit. All right. - I'm going to watch it then. - Listen, listen. [GET WHAT YOU NEED] You hear about Woodgate? Own goal, red card on his debut for Madrid. Really? Fucking Geordie cunt! You stood there for the last fucking half an hour rabbiting. It was just... It's just fucking... I didn't even go like that. He's like that. I'm buzzing. - I'm buzzing off the gig still. - Yeah, all right. What do you mean? What? I did fuck all. What? - It's a bit weird. - In about 16 minutes. All right, boys, have a great gig. I'll see you after. [CHAMPAGNE SUPERNOVA] And now we come to the Best Album award. To present this award, will you please welcome Richard Ashcroft? All right, all right, here we go. The Best Album... The winner is, the band that changed my life, Oasis. [LYLA] Right, then. Who's first, then? I'd like to thank all the people who voted for us. It's not often we come here and don't get that shit token gesture of Live Act. Great. You can play the guitar. Fucking nice one. But nice one for the Best Album. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hey, boys. Come back, come back. Oasis, come back. Come on. I use the collective term because I've got something else for you. This is the much-coveted Q People's Choice Award. This award recognises an act who received a record number of nominations and votes. You got a staggering 230,000-plus votes across five categories. This is for you. The Q People's Choice award for 2005 also goes to Oasis. Can I thank the girls in the office for voting for that? Thank you very much. The first time, Millennium Stadium. How do you feel about it? Seeing as though my football team are never likely to get here, I'm representing all Manchester City supporters. You're walking around with photographs of yourself. - It's a picture of me and Ringo. - There you go. See. Look. - I told you I'd keep them, didn't I? - Yeah. - Cracker, that. - He's calling you a wanker. - He is. He's like that... - He's saying, "Teach us some moves." - Someone would like to meet you. - I don't give a fuck. - Who is it? - A midget? - Wee Jimmy Krankie. - Get them in. Bring them in. Come on, guys. - You all right, James? - All right. - How are you doing? - I'm fine. You? - Good to see you. - Nice to see you. - Will. - All right, Will. - Hi, I'm Alan. - Hiya. How are you doing? Are you all right? Cold enough for you? - Yeah. - You're growing up, aren't you? - What have you been up to, then? - Not much, really. - Nowt? - No. - Have you? - I've been ducking and diving. Just keeping my head down. - It's an amazing crowd out there. - It's gonna go off. - Over 75,000. - Yeah. It's gonna be great. Get a drink and make yourselves at home. - Thanks. - Cheers. Maggie? Maggie? The Night of the Midget. Another name for a band. Stretch the cunt back to shape. They're fucking small and heavy, aren't they? [THE MEANING OF SOUL] Here we go. Noel, do you want to do the last push? Go on, mate. Fucking hell! If it was down to Maggie, it would be that. Thanks for the great year, Scully! You know what I mean? Come on, City! Come on! Please say hello to Matthew. This is Gavin's best friend. - Where's Gavin? - He's in Leicester. - And this is Guy. - Hello. Can I please have a photo of you? Concentrate on the man. Hang on. - That's my phone ringing. - Put "To Elliot." That's my little cousin. I'm so sorry. - Press "No". - Press "No". Right. - I got it, I got it. - Do you wanna find Liam, as well? I don't mean to be a burden but can you have a photo with these fellas? Come on, mate. You're my fucking complete idol. Can I have a photo? - Done, yeah? - Did you get it? Let's go down to the pub. I pressed it. Come on. Quick, quick, quick. Right. Let's get some booze. Send that to everyone. I'm sorry. Noel, can you please say hello to Matthew? - I've already done that. - Yeah, he has. I'm so sorry. I'm a bit drunk. Get your brother. Come on now. We need the whole fucking full shebang. - The full shemonkey. - Where's the shebang? The whole fucking shebang. What? Oh, for fuck's sake! Hello there. - Hello. Nice to meet you. - Have you met Scully? Hello, Scully. Nice to meet you, lovely. - All right, girl. - You all right, love? Look at the size of that fucking bottle! I'll pop in that side. Just this way. Ready? One, two, three... - All right. - Come on. - Yes. - Go and get your ma down. Can you see my pepperonis? You're kidding me! Everyone's got an entrance to the zone. What time of day is it, then? - Ten past four. - In the morning? Ten past four in the afternoon. - What time is it in England? - Nine hours behind. - What's that, then? - Seven o'clock in the morning. - Have you been touring? - Yeah. What's the mood of the band like at this moment? It was all right until last night. Yeah. I think Liam started to see himself as a bit of a mad genius. It just pisses me off that you're blasé about it. Why are you trying to pick a fight? You go and fucking lick arse for the NME! They slagged our record off. He's doing a cover next week with them. It's all good crack to me. I don't give a fuck one way or the other. I sell your records and I buy you a big house in the country. - End of. Shut the fuck up. - What do you mean? That's the way it goes. End of. Shut the fuck up. We'll get Noel on the cover, slag his record off, and he'll turn up cos he's fucking into himself. Fucking rubbish! You should have more respect for our band. Other than that, it's pretty good. Going through the set list, you've quite a lot of songs from the two first albums rather than the new one. Is there a reason for that? Yeah, because old sausage fingers, the singer, is a lazy little cunt. And he only sings things that he's been singing for the last 35 years or however long we've been fucking doing it now, which is... It's getting... It's a bit... It's a bit fucking... It's a bit dull, really, for someone that claims to be fucking, you know, mad for it. He's anything but mad for it. You seem to be filming a documentary. Can you tell us...? What's it about? It's about Japanese journalists. I see! We're filming as many Japanese journalists as we can find and then we're gonna take the tapes back to England and analyse it. And do you know what the title of the film's called? - No. - What The Fuck Were They On About? OK. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Thank you very much. - All right. My name's Liam. - Gem. We're Oasis and you're watching Music On TV. Little fuckers. Thank you so much. All right. This is Liam and Gem from Oasis. You're watching Stand. Always wear four condoms. One on your head, three on your cock. OK. Well, thank you. No, no, no. Sorry. Bear with me just a little bit more, please. On this tour, has there been any accidents or incidents? I got my head caught in a polo neck. I got my neck caught in a polo-neck jumper the other day. - That was pretty frightening. - Oh, no! We're all jet-lagged. If someone would give me the option now of doing the gig or going to bed, I'd rather go to bed. But apart from that, everybody's really happy to be here. Like I say, time has flown by on this tour. We were sat at an airport in Spain last week or the week before. We couldn't believe it was seven months since our first... since our first gig. It seems like about seven weeks. And, going on the road, travelling to different countries, you meet all these big audience. How does it feel to stand in front of these massive audience? It feels right. Yeah. It feels normal, man. It's easy. What do you think of the Japanese audience? Beautiful. And what do you do to put on a great show? Nothing, really. We're not a band like that. I don't think we put on a show. I think people put on the show. We just go and play our guitars and sing. There's not much of a show going on. What do you think is great about live shows in general? Because it's one take, you know what I mean? You can't go back and do the song again. That's what's good about it. The crowd is the best thing, I think. Oasis is straightforward, there's no frills. So, if the crowd are into it, it makes the gig better, I reckon. - It depends on the crowd. - We're as good as the crowd. We just get in a bubble, man. The sound. When it's going good, you just think, "This is the best fucking spot in the universe." [FUCKIN' IN THE BUSHES] [LORD DON'T SLOW ME DOWN] Thank you very much, ladies. Well, we're going again! Oh, now you're talking! We're rocking! - Five games in! - I've given 21. Champ goes first. - You dirty cunt! - Two. Gotta beat two. One! - One! - Tie-breaker. - Three! - Three! Us two win. You two have a pop-off. You two have a pop-off. - And again. - Rubbish. I feel like I've won already. Open that bottle of wine there. Anything French. Sorry. No such word as "sorry" in this game. You need a little black book to write down... How will that work with his shoulders? Keep your finger on for the whole game. If your next one gets round, you get three. Green corner. Five. - You are shit. - I tried to tell you. You'll get all of them now. - Any one? - That one there. It's all over! Cunt! It's all over now. It's all over. - Fucking... - Smash that board up! What are the chances? I mean, it's fucking... It's 33,000 to 1. Three games on the spin. Three games on the spin. You both had it in your fucking hands! Sorry, lads, but that's the fucking name of the game. I'm so frustrated. - I'm popping fucking mad! - Are you popping mad? - Are you popping mad? - Fucking popping mad. Four sixes and a three. - Bastard! - Unheard of. Unheard of in all the years I've been playing that game. Yeah, cos it's a total fluke. You jammy fucker! I needed one! [HELP] What, a discount, as well? Half-price? Only last night, I was sat in the bar with a so-called fan who said... I said, "Did you go to the gig last night?" She said, "Yes." I said, "What was it like?" She said, "Very good, but I'm worried about your voice." I went, "Why?" She went, "It doesn't sound very good." I was like, "Well, actually I've got a fucking cold.” You're gonna get some time off to play in Australia. We get three days off as soon as we get there. That was really appealing until we read al-Qaeda are in town. It's like, "Fuck that for a game of tennis!" It's not a good recipe, al-Qaeda and Liam Gallagher. How is your gorgeous brother? Is he behaving himself? Yeah, he's all right. He's smelling weird today. I don't know what I mean by "weird". He doesn't usually smell. He definitely smelt left-field. [LYLA] - What's with this fucking weather? - It's boring. It looks like Manchester. All day. It's interesting you arrived here with an entourage. - You've gotta have one. - You've gotta have one. It's hardly Snoop Doggy Dogg when you look around. Tell me, what do you do on your day off? Yesterday I didn't do much because I had a hangover from the night before. - Are you a yoga person? - A lot of bands do that now. - The yoga mats... - Cos, you know... Do I look like a yoga person to you? When you're watching a live performance of a band, what are you looking at? The way they sing it? The tightness of it? - Or the showmanship? - It depends what catches your eye. Sometimes, the front man is really good. - Have you seen Kasabian yet? - No. He's a great front man, Tom, and you can't take your eyes off him, whereas, when you watch us, Liam doesn't do that much but, apparently, that's spellbinding. - Was that funny? - Well, no. No, I mean... I read in interviews that he's the greatest front man of his generation and I go... - He's good. - Well, apparently. What do you think makes a great front man? Having a brilliant songwriter behind you. You are in... You're going to be in Brisbane playing and I think the Sydney and Melbourne shows are sold out, which is as it should be. So, are you having a good time, the three days off? I'm glad I'm back at work today. I don't think I could have done another day sitting in the rain. The weather's been atrocious. Just look out. And how are things between you and Liam these days? - Pretty good. - Yeah? It depends how you look at it. It's as good or as bad as it's ever been. There's only two people in the world that are least fascinated by that relationship and that's me and him. Whatever we might say about each other in the press, it's all done with a large pinch of salt. Now, this story I heard, I like it so I'm gonna check if it's true. Did your brother really think Spinal Tap was a real band? Yes, he did. We went to see them at Carnegie Hall in New York and... He's either one of the greatest actors ever or he genuinely didn't know that they were... Saying that, did he really believe there was a place called Squatney? I don't know. In between one of the songs we were talking and someone said that they were American actors and he said, "You what? Who are?" We said, "They're American actors." "They're not English?" "No. They're American. They're actors." "It's not a real band?" He walked out. - I've enjoyed talking to you. - Thank you. I've enjoyed listening to myself. I think I've been fabulous company. Fucking hell! Have that. - Fucking talk to her before...! - Fucking knobhead! I know he is. The dirty cunt. [CUT AND SHUT (WORKING TITLE)] So, you're going... It's cool. That was fucking close! - That's handball. Handball. - Fucking hell! - Come on. Here we go. - That's shit. That is pure rock and roll, man. Fucking rubbish! - Fucking hell! - That was shit! Nearly there. That's Russell Crowe's gaff. Do you know where we can get some oysters from? Lock and loll. - You never go swimming at dawn. - I can't swim, man. I had an accident in the water years ago when I was five and to this day I thought I was saved by Elvis. I was walking along and I slipped and I went under and a geezer, out of the blue, dived in. This fucking bloke looked like Elvis and he brought me to the fucking top, give me one of them pumps. I went to my mam and she said, "Where the fuck have you been?" "I fucking nearly drowned." "Well, who saved you?" "Fucking Elvis!" Hello. Pleased to meet you. - I was tempted but I didn't. - What, to close the case? To play your guitar. I'm hair of the dog today so please forgive me. I'm hair of the dog every fucking day. We've been through the old bios and stuff on the website. One of the comments was you act your best when you don't give a fuck. So, if this is a return to form does that mean you don't give a fuck? I don't think it is a return to form. I don't think we ever lost our form. I just think people got sick of us and decided not to listen. That's life, you know what I mean? I never... Talking about personally, I never lost my form. I never went on stage and didn't give 100 per cent, ever. When we walked on stage in Japan it was like, "Fucking hell, man." It was like putting a new pair of headphones on. It was mega. It was like, "It's the Blue fucking Caps." Yeah, but they were only... He had different amps on them, too. So, do you listen to music, sing in the shower and have the radio on in the car? - No. - No. That's strange. You're not a music lover as such? No, I fucking hate it! I'm here for the money. We should just fucking buy a monitor system and fucking have it at that because it's a fucking joke, man. I bet it never happens to Bono. It probably never happens to Bono. I would say it never happens. I think I'll go on the record as saying it would never happen to Bono. OK? Guaranteed. And as for the fucking buzzing, that's fucking Mickey Mouse. That's got to fucking stop. I don't care if we've gotta take 200 lights out of the fucking rig. I'm not arsed about it looking good. That's just shite. It is a strange dynamic, isn't it, to be in a band with someone that you, on paper, don't like and don't see much of? I actually love him. He just likes to give it the big one. I think he's amazing. Cheers. - Thank you. - Go back to bed. Go back to bed? Me? I'm going to a gig. He'd be good in movies. He likes the camera. - Another one? - Yeah. You've got one more. It's interesting that you don't wanna hang out with your brother... I'll be hanging out with him on stage in about fucking two hours' time. I live my life. We're not fucking... We're not Siamese twins joined at the fucking hip. He's a big boy and I'm a big boy. I do my thing, he does his thing. - You never hang with your brother? - I see enough of the cunt on tour. What would I hang out with him for? As soon as I close the tour I don't wanna see his ugly head. He doesn't want to see mine. All right. What's happening with the live shows? Not much. Pretty much the same. Five lads walk on stage and fucking have it. - So, what do you do before a gig? - Wank. So, you qualified for the World Cup, then? Which is quite ironic now you're shit at cricket. You can boo all you fucking like. And the thing is, I fucking hate cricket but I know it does your heads in big time, doesn't it? And aren't you shit at rugby now, as well? Aren't you shit at everything but really good at football, apparently? Is anybody here from Scotland? Now, you are shit at cricket. Feel free to join in. [DON'T LOOK BACK IN ANGER] I write songs all the time. I can't see myself stop doing that. What else would I do? I'm no good at anything else. But the touring thing may have to come to an end eventually because I really don't think I'd have the energy to do it for as long as the Rolling Stones. I feel fucked at 38 years of age. God knows what Mick Jagger must feel like at 110. Eventually, Liam will go bald. That's for sure. As soon as he goes bald, I think we'll quit then. This will be the last one but nice one for coming out to see the lads. I'd like to dedicate it to the band and the boys. It's been a long time on the road. [LORD DON'T SLOW ME DOWN]
