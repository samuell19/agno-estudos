- Now it had become the still center of that spinning wheel of misfortune. The world turned round him, leaving him miraculously untouched. The croupier had reached his goal. He no longer heard the sound of the ball. To begin with, he was Jack Manfred. - Now, then. - I want a job, Giles. - I see. Well... Let me tell you a little bit about our operation. We like personality authors. People the public recognizes. Celebrity's what sells books. You can always find somebody to do the writing. What we need is the face... then the concept. Right now I'm looking for a soccer novel. Something where a tycoon buys a lousy team and takes it to the top. Seven-figure transfer fees. Corruption all down the line. Violence on and off the pitch. Steroids. You got any concepts? It could be a thug story. I'll tell you what, why don't you think about it? Hmm? Couple of pages. With plenty of sex, of course. Fiona! - Interesting, Giles. I will think about it. - Let me give you three words of advice, Jack. Don't give up. Stick with it. Who persists, wins, that's my motto. Write, write, write. - And Jack had three words for Giles. Go fuck yourself. Jack knew something was wrong. He'd forgotten Giles' advice. Giles said three words. Nobody around, leave a message after the beep. - Jacko. If you're there, pick up, would ya. I want to talk to you, it's important. Jacko, I've got some news for you. Come on, Jacko. - Yeah, Dad, it's me. - How's it going? - Good, yeah. - Found a job yet? - No. - Well I've got something for you, in London I mean. I've been chatting with some friends. Now... Do you know the Golden Lion Casino? They're looking for a dealer. - Yeah, that's not what I wanna do, Dad. - Now, I know you don't like taking my advice... - No, it's not that. - Listen, I've set this up for you. Now you call the Golden Lion, and you ask to speak to Mr. Reynolds. That's the manager. Now I don't know him personally, but I have spoken to his boss. Now, don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break. - All right, Dad. Yeah, I'll think about it. - Reynolds at the Golden Lion. - Yeah. All right, Dad. - Yes. I'll call him. - You do that. - That's my boy. - So how are you doing, Dad? - Great. Yeah, just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good. Jacko, you know I love you, don't you? - Yeah. I know that. - Don't let yourself down. - I won't. - I'll keep in touch. - Goodbye, Dad. - It was unbelievable. - I was in the room. 500. Uh-huh. Blackjack. See you then, bye. - Sorry to have kept you. - What'll you have? - Nope. Jack knew it still wasn't quite right. - I wanna fuck the whole world over! Ha! - He had just one word for Giles. - David Reynolds. - I'm the manager. - Sit down, John. - Jack. - You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He's a bit of a reputation, hasn't he? - Has he? - In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience in South Africa. You'll find the rules here just a little bit different. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you? - No. - What school did you go to? - I was at Bedales. - Oh. I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose. There's three types of casino in the UK. High volume, small action, and middle of the road. That's us. Okay, Charlie. - Do you have a salon prive? - We tried. - Wasn't enough business. - Punters like company. - Welcome back, Jack... ...to the house of addiction. - Thanks, Charlie. Right. Let's see you handle the chips. - I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and wheel correspond. - We check every two days. - Why not every day? - Procedure here. Right, sort the chips. Go. Good. All right, now pay me out $1,800 in 25s. Very good. Okay, let's have a look at your blackjack. - Fourteen. Too many. Nineteen, Sixteen. Too many. Thirteen. Eighteen, Fourteen. Nineteen. Twenty. - What's the count? - Minus nine. - I make it minus eight. - Minus nine. - What makes you so sure? - It's the rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right. - Good call. - You want me to check? - I said, good call. - lthadtaken him 45 minutes, but Jack now had Mr. Reynolds' number. The man couldn't count. - Right, just let me run through a few things. As a dealer, you never gamble. Not anywhere. And we'll need your picture. - What for? - For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters. - I don't gamble. - Ever? - I don't gamble, Mr. Reynolds. - Huh. - Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here... - are expressly forbidden. - We had the same rule in Sun City, but it was impossible to check. - Well this isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does. - Does know, or does report? - What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it? - We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. - And you'd be punished. - How? - First offense, verbal warning. - Second offense, written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the gaming board. My discretion. Third offense, you'd be sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again. And there's another rule. You're forbidden to talk to or recognize a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him or her. Not married, are you? Girlfriend? - Yeah. - She's not in the... she's not in the gaming business, is she? - No. - Good. This is our Crow's nest. I'm showing you it now, but you'll never see it again. - Very impressive. - We have tapes here that go back six months. Here, let me show you something. See that? Six weeks ago. Dealer missed it. Guy up here missed it. I watch these tapes after hours. Nothing gets by me. Lady's in jail now. It's easier to take ten million pounds from a bank, than to take one penny from this casino. Right. Well, as soon as you get your license, you can start. - Fine. - So... Are you planning to make a career in casino work? And end up like you? L-- I just want a job. - You're not the usual type we get in here, Jack. Mr. Reynolds was right, it was true. Excuse me. - Jack was up above the world. A writer looking down on his subject. A detached... - I can't talk about that just now. - Voyeur. - I'm with somebody. Well, they can wait. I'll be home at the usual time. Don't get married, Jack. Casino work doesn't mix with house and garden. Any questions? - Yeah. What's the salary? - The casino paid its staff monthly in arrears. He would have to wait six weeks for his first check. - He needed money now. - So, what kind of deal are you looking for? - What's the book price? - That's not relevant. Old car like this, depends on the condition. - The car was a gift from Jack's father. That's to say, Jack Sr. Had given it to him before the bailiffs arrived. - And this ain't exactly what you call "mint." - How about $1,500? - How about $500? - What? - How about we split the difference? $750. - Is that your idea of arithmetic? - I'm not a mathematician. - I'm in business. - $850. - $750. - He suddenly wanted to be rid of it. Hang on tightly, let go lightly. Jack imagined people reading his book. One day he would get into their heads. Play with their imaginations. Test their feelings. He would tell them, you have to make the choice in life. Be a gambler, or a croupier. And then live with your decision, come what may. Marion saw life differently. She was a romantic... and thought he was, too. - I couldn't resist them. - You mean I won't resist them. - No. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer. - You want me drunk? - I won't take that long! Jack. - Wow. You really are a beautiful woman. - It's not just inner beauty, is it? - Turn around. You're all I desire. - Where did you get it? - I sold the car. - You shouldn't have done that, I know what it meant to you. - I owe you for the rent. It's only a car, I can get another. - Take it back. - No. - Till you sell your book. - Marion, let's face the truth. Nobody is gonna publish it. - Of course, they are. - You just have to be patient. - I'm betting on you. - I'm not much of a bet. - You are to me. Come into my world. You're my prisoner. - I've got something to tell you. - I wanna hear it. - I've got a job. - What job'? - In a casino. As a croupier. Dealer. - How did you land that? - It came my way. 450 a week. ' 450'? What did you do? Just walk in and say, - I want to be a croupier? - Don't you need training? - I had training. - In the republic. - You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers. - I start Monday week. - 450 a week? I've never earned that in my life. You're an enigma, you are. A fucking enigma. - I'm not an enigma. - Just a contradiction. - You sold the car. You've got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me. - There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious. - I love you, Jack. - You know that. - And he half-loved Marion, and she knew that, too. You trying to read my palm? - You've got such beautiful hands. The hands of a Conjurer, a woman told him once. Or a cardsharp. - Do you work around here? - My office is in Shanghai. - What do you do? - I'm an arms dealer. - So, what line of work are you in, then? - I'm an undertaker. - Really? - Now place your bets, please. - Jack Manfred. - Jack Manfred. Table three. - And you have a new dealer. Thank you. Usual bunch. They didn't know Jack, but he knew them. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. - Where's the other fellow? Where's Jeff? - Where's Jeff'? - Jeff. He's been re-assigned, sir. - Well let's hope you know how to do your job. - In fives. - Change. - What aftershave are you using? - Never converse with the punters. Slows things down. Money down. Speed is volume. Volume is profit for the casino. Aim at 4O spins an hour. Place your bets, please. No more bets, thank you. 10 black. Ooh, the scam. Come in with three grand cash, no questions asked. Launder it by getting a casino check when you cash in. Jack wondered why Mr. Reynolds permitted it. After all, there was no profit in it for the casino. Place your bets, please. Or was there? 13. Too many. 16. Too many. 15. Too many. 12. Too many. 11, Double. 21. Black jack. A wave of elation came over him. He was hooked again. Place your bets, please. Watching people lose. New dealer. - Evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. - Jack. Good work. Keep it up. - Color change. 100. Place your bets, please. Don't give me that sob story. - That's a lie, Ben. - You've been secretly seeing Charlie for years. - Stop it! - No I won't. - I'm Bella. - Jack Manfred. - Hi, Jack. Welcome to the cesspit. - Is it that bad? - How do I look? Like trouble, Bella. You look fine. - Tits in a uniform. - Punters love it. - Your usual, sir. Thank you, sir. Enjoy your game. 5O quid for a Diet Coke. Waitresses were the true winners in a casino. The only members of staff allowed to accept tips. - Thank you, Jack. Enjoy yourself, Mr. Tchai. - On a good night they could get - between 200 or 300 quid. - Good evening, Mr. Tchai. - Evening. - Mr. Tchai always loves to sit at that table. - And only with Bella. - Does he win? - He's a good customer. - A good customer is a consistent loser. But is that what he meant? - Where do you live, Jack? - Over the river. - You got transport? - No. - I'm going over the river. - I'll give you a lift - if you like. - Nice one, thanks. - So how do you feel? - Your first night on the job? Bet you're on a high. - Nice car. - She's my baby. - So how long have you worked at the casino? - Coming up to two years now. But I was away for six months. - Looks like you've done pretty well. - Not bad. I have other interests, of course. Listen, I'm off to a little watering hole. Have a few drinks, relax. Want to join me? - No thanks. I'm gonna go home. I need my eight hours. - I bet you five to one you won't get any sleep. You've got to unwind in this job, Jack... Or it'll kill you. I mean that. - Some other time. - What time is it? - No idea. - How did it go? - Yeah, fine. - You're shaking. - What is it? - It's just tension. - It'll go. - Poor baby. This'll relax you. - I loved it blonde. - Oh look, it's only hair. I haven't changed. - When you come home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep. - Mmm. - Bye. - I'll see you in my dreams. - 2O fives. - Change. 500. Money down. Place your bets, please. - Two, six, 13. Jack could see this woman was an experienced gambler. Professionals always place their bets through the croupier. That way there are no comebacks. - One, five, 16, and the neighbors. No more bets. Thank you. 13 black. Eight seven five. Place your bets, please. - Two, six, 13. - Two, six, 13. - Orphans. - Orphans by 25. 125 the bet. - Orphans. - Orphans by five. - One, five, 16 and the neighbors. No more bets. Thank you. - 34 red. No, I'm sorry, sir. - That's a late bet. - What are you talking about? - 34, I won with this lady. - No. You've won with the chips you placed earlier, But the bet on 34 was a late bet. - I put it all together. - I'm afraid that's not so, sir. - Now look here, I-- - Is there a problem? - Yes! This croupier is accusing me of cheating. Do you think I cheated? - In my opinion, it was a late bet. - I think we should talk about this... away from the table. - No, I won. - I want to be paid. - Pay the gentleman. - In full. Now. We'd better talk in my office sir. - Why? - We paid you out this time, but I'm afraid you won't be welcome here again. - You bastard! - On your way, please, sir. - 1300. I'm sorry, madam. We're not allowed to accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa. - You know where I'm from. - I've lived there. - Well, thank you anyway. Bright woman, he thought. She knew the rule of gold. Place your bets, please. Quit when you're ahead. Matt, listen. There's something I've got to say to you. - I saw you cheating. - What the fuck - are you talking about? - That Greek guy at the end. You paid him out 25s, not 10s. - You got it wrong, Jack. - I don't cheat. - I'm not gonna report it. - What are you, a fucking cop? - But if I see you doing it again, I will. - I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you? - Because if the supervisor knew that I'd seen it and didn't report it, then I'd lose my job, - and I can't afford that. - Oh, so it's Mr. Clean. Wise up, Jack. This whole business is bent. The casino's nothing but legal theft, and that's okay. It's the system. Half the punters who come in here are using stolen money. Drugs money. They haven't even earned it. We earn our money. I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy. - You're talking about complicity. - I don't even know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat. Matt was an escape artist. - Like Jack's father. - Okay. Now, let's unwind. Hey, Andros. - This is Jack. - Hello. - How you doing? - Blackjack. - One blackjack and... drink? - Vodka, straight on the rocks. - Vodka straight coming up. - Who are these guys'? - A few drug dealers. - Mostly people that work In the casino business. - And the girls? - Just girls. - Blackjack, and vodka straight. - Does Bella come here? - The bitch? No. - Matt, you want in? - Yeah, why not? - Jack, join us? - No thanks. - I won't report you. - I don't gamble. - You don't gamble? - But do you smoke? - Sometimes. - How about now? - Same again, yeah? - Coming up. Marion, I'm on my way. - All right, lads. - Divvy up. - Listen, I'm gonna get off. - I need to sleep. - Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job will get to you. Pressure's too much. Believe me, It'll break you. - The world breaks everyone. And afterwards many are strong at the broken places. - Ernest Hemingway. - Wasn't he the one who shot himself? - Where have you been? - I've got to give evidence In court at nine. - Don't play the policewoman with me, Marion. - Take that back! - Fucking take that back! - Yeah, I take it back. You're not in the police anymore. You're a store detective. - Are you drunk? - Probably. - This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since it started. - Do you have to swear all the time? - Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to private school. I haven't got any class. I wanna live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. - Croupier. - Marion, stop this. - What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me. - You're my conscience. - Haven't you got a conscience of your own? - Fuck. Shit! - Fancy a drink after work? - What are you doing here? - You know the rules. I don't finish till 9:00. Shit. I'm on at 9:00. - That's our life now, isn't it? Thinking of going back? - Oh, my god. Hello. - You know what? - I'd like to buy you a drink. - It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters. - What are the odds of you being seen with me? - Impossible to calculate. - It's a coincidence. - You know, there's a casino in this hotel. - I'm not really much of a gambler. I just like this bar. - First visit to London? - No. No, I come every couple of years. I always plan to stay, but... I'm from Cape Town originally. - I was born in the Transkei. - On the wild coast. - Near the casino. - In the casino. Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there. Your father? I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my mother. - The debts? - And the lies. - Gamblers are born liars. - And superstitious too. - It's like witchcraft. - That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there? - We all came from Africa supposedly. - Do you believe in astrology? - Absolutely not. But then I'm a Gemini, and Geminis don't believe in astrology. - You know, you don't strike me as a typical croupier. Ah, I'm not married. I just wear it to keep the flies off. Look, I have to go. - Let me pay for this. - Absolutely not. - Toss you for it. - I don't gamble. - I know this is verboten, but... if you feel like a chat, or maybe dinner, give me a call. I'll understand if you don't. But I hope that you do. - Jack started to dress for the casino at home. A man in love with his uniform. Like a musician in his tuxedo going to the concert hall on public transport. Eager to perform. - No more bets. - Thank you. - 19 red. - Animal! - The croupier registered disgust. This gentleman's accidentally coughed on the chips. - The writer made a note. Good scene for the book. - Agnes, take these chips off the table for me. - I can't give you a lift back tonight. - Don't worry about it. - See you, Jack. - Yeah, see you. 0 Jack, do you want a lift? - No. I'm okay, thanks. - Maybe some other time. - I'll take you up on that. - Hey, you don't recognize me? You had me barred, you fucking little worm. - If I remember rightly, you got yourself barred. - No, it was you, you shit. - Jack! Jack! Come on, leave him. Jack, you don't want the police here, come on. Jack! - He won't cheat again. - You're shaking. - It's nothing. - It's just tension. Oh... Fuck! Oh, shit! It's funny, isn't it? If that bloke hadn't have come over, you wouldn't be here now. - I hate cheats. - All men are cheats. - Are they? - Fools. I spent a year on the game. Don't worry. I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S and M. No blowjobs. No screwing. - Why did you stop? - Got scared. - Yeah. I can imagine. - Can you? Anyway, I'm happy being a dealer now. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves, even if the other dealers don't. - You called the casino a cesspit. - Well, it is. But at least I know where I am. I've been watching you work. You're good. Too fucking good for that place. - I despise the job. - If you hate it so much, why do you do it? Jack suddenly had the feeling that he was transparent, that Bella could see right through him. - You've got a guilty look. - We broke the rules. - Shit, he hadn't meant to say that. She'd caught him unawares. - You're certainly different from the others. Careful. This liaison, forbidden in the casino family, was incest. - Not like Matt, you mean. - Now there's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. Do you know what he said to me once? I wanna fuck the whole world over, that's my mission. Stupid little shit. Thank you, Bella. Jack could hear Matt saying it. I want to fuck the whole world over, it's my mission. Eureka. Jack had struck gold. He'd found a protagonist for his book. Little Matt. - Chapter one. - I look like shit. - Rough day? - Rough life, Jack. Rough life. - Hi. I'm Pat. - Hello. - See you, boys. - What happened to Bella? - I'll tell you later. - Change. $5,000. - What has happened to Bella? - What's happened to Bella? - She's been re-assigned. - Not re-assigned, just written out of the story. - Good evening. - Hundreds. - Change. 1,000. - Now this was no coincidence. Fifteen, Too many. 20,18,19,17... Nineteen. Did she think he'd bring her luck'? - Can I get anything for you? - 14. - Why had she come? Too many. Did she want him to help her win? Eleven double. Twenty one. 18,17,17... 13, 20. Change. He knew how to fix it for her. $1,000. His father had taught him the trick. The casino wouldn't spot it, but Jack was wary of the punters. 11 double. He could see Mr. Tchai was counting. He couldn't risk it. 12. 20. 18, 18, 17... 19. She wasn't wearing her ring. Odds on she'd sold it. - Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. Thank you, she said. For what, Jack thought. He ought to thank her. - Pretty woman. - Jani De Villiers had just entered his book. Place your bets, please. - Yeah. - How's it going, Jacko? - Fine. I took that job. - Good for you. - I was wondering what was happening. - Yeah, well, I tried to call you, but they said your line was disconnected. - Ah, yes. I moved house. I needed a bigger place. - How's that book of yours coming on? - Yeah. I'm getting there. - Well, it's a good job you've got the job to fall back on, isn't it? Huh? Oh, there's my other line. Ciao. - I don't like it. - Why not? - I don't like it at all. It had a wonderful character before. The gambler was so romantic. - He was a loser. This guy's a croupier, he can't lose. People have shat on him all his life, and now he's in control. He's a winner. - Is that your idea of a winner? He couldn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people-- - It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it. - I couldn't give a fuck about the sex. Most men will fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you? - Marion, it's a book. - Really? Then why is he called Jake? Why don't you come clean, and call him Jack? There's no hope in it. - It's the truth. - Without hope, there's no point to anything. - What is so fucking hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing? You said yourself the organized gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everyone gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same, it's all relative. - Crap! It is not relative. It's unfair. - It's designed unfair, like your casino, and your croupier's a little shit, because he goes along with it. - Yeah? What about the lottery? Look at this, you're just like all the other suckers out there. 14 and a half million to one, is that your idea of hope? - The door, Jack. - Leave it. - No. Answer it. - Just called round to say thanks for shopping me, Jack. - What are you talking about? - Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to do a dope test which was positive, as you knew. - I don't know anything about it. - Hiya. - Hi. - Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, and then shopped me. What do you think about that? I can't get a job now. You're no different from Matt. Pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are. - Bella, I don't know anything about this. - All men are scumbags. - I agree. Go on. Go after her. - He was Jack... and he was Jake. And he had discovered there was a price to pay for this double life of his. He had no idea where Marion was staying, or with whom. He realized he knew little about her life, but then... He had never asked about it. For the first time in a long while, Jack thought about his mother. She'd left when she couldn't take it any more. His father had said, don't worry Jack, oh, she'll come back. She didn't. But Marion wasn't his mother. He's paying out twenty-fives, not tens. - I see that. Little shit, Matt. - Chapter three: His existence was forming an interesting pattern of betrayals. Sometimes he was unsure whether he was the betrayer or the betrayed. - Thanks for the information. - Pleasure. Pity about Bella. - She was a real asset. What could I do? Sorry, Jack. No smoking in the nest. - Thank you, sir. - Fantastic, brilliant. - Just down the side. Jack? I thought it was you, It's the hair. - Listen, I'm working on that soccer story. - Right. Look, I must get back to Habib. - Habib? - He's my author. He's a terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book. Take care. - That's 4.99, sir. - Thank you. - Jack... Look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here. It's just near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social, no business. Bring a friend, I've got plenty of room. - I'll try and make it. - Good. Looking forward. Right! - Your change, sir. - Thanks. Books piled like chips. Stack 'em high, sell 'em fast, make a killing. No dumb soccer novel for Jack. He would write about the world he knew. From the inside. Chapter four. I don't know how you can drive at night in those glasses. How'd you hurt your hand? - Oh, it was just an accident. - It's nothing. - Should be the next on the right. Jani, there's something I want to say before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room. - That's fine. Look. It's no use pretending it was an accident. I had a fight with someone. That's all. - She's a dab hand with the racket, your friend. - South African women are very sporty. - So I see. - Nice serve. - 14-15. - How did she get that shiner? - I found her in bed with someone. - Who was he? - She. - I say, you're a dark horse, Jack. - Lovely shot. - Nice game. - Come on, Jack. - I don't gamble. - Don't be a spoil-sport. - It's only a few quid. - It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble. - He doesn't gamble. - I'll watch. - Jack likes to watch. Does he like to watch? - One more remark like that, and I'll break your balls. I bet she could too. - I'll deal, but I won't play. - Sure you know how? The hands of a conjurer. Or a cardsharp. - Okay, last hand. - I've got an idea. - No. No stripping. - Right, we're not having that again. Although... - I'll stick to bluffing. That's what I'm best at. Stick. - Stick. - I don't know. - Two cards. - Two cards. - Two cards. - Two cards. One card. - One card. - Three cards. - Three. - I'll start With... a tenner. - I'll see your ten and I'll raise you ten. - I'll see your 2O and raise you ten. - Thirty, raise ten. - Forty- Raise you by 20. - I'll match that, and raise you a tenner. - I'm in. - Yes, that's it. I haven't got any more cash. - Yeah. - I call. - See you. - A straight. - Beat that. A flush. - Oh Shit. - Not so fast, darling. - A full house. - Hang on, chaps, that's impossible. - Well how's about this for impossible? Four of a kind. What's going on? - No. - Straight flush. - What are the odds of this happening? - Thousands to one. - 42,300,000 to one. - Approximately. - Could have won if I'd been able to bluff. - I get it. - Get what? Are you accusing me of cheating? - Good god, no. With a skill like that, why do you want a job for? You don't need to work. - Here was an interesting question. Was writing work? Qr play? - What happened? - Remember that guy who cheated at the table? - You don't like cheats, do you? So, which side do you like? - You choose. - That trick tonight. I don't think I've ever seen that done before. - It can only work with amateurs. - A pro would have spotted it. - I didn't. - Then you're not a pro. - Good night. Jack. - Jack. - What? - I need your help. I'm in a lot of trouble. - What kind of trouble? - I owe a lot of money. - Was that why you did that two grand? - I couldn't help you. - I know that. But you can now. - I'm sorry, I don't have any money. - Some people I know. They're planning to rob the Golden Lion. - You don't mean that. - They mean it. - Who's they? - My creditors. One night, around 3:00 in the morning, - they'll come into the casino... - Forget it Jani. It'll never work. - The point is, they want a man inside. - And I took you for a bright woman. - Just listen, You don't have to do anything criminal. - Robbery's not criminal? - You don't have to be criminal. A guy will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him. The guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos and that's when it'll happen. - You're serious. - You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job. That's all. - Shit. - And I thought you were only after my body. - I've come to know you. You're honest, I can trust you. - So what will you do when it all goes wrong? - It won't. - But if it does. - You'll keep the 10,000 pounds. - What 10,000 pounds? - These people will pay you 10,000 before, and 10,000 after. They want someone they can be sure of. An honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr. Reynolds will never suspect you. - Reynolds. You've done your research. - There was nothing else I could do. You're my last chance. Next time it'll be my neck. - What about my neck? - I want to go back to Cape Town. I want to start again, clean. - Can't do xx, Jam. - I'm asking you as a friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend. - Jack wondered why he was even considering it. Ten grand... In cash. That was why. But Jack didn't need the money. His father would have taken it like a shot, but his father was a gambler. He was always broke. Jack suddenly realized: It was Jake who was considering it. How much do you owe? - Let it go. - Did they tell you to sleep with me? - I told you, all bets are off. - I'm sorry. - What for? - I have to take the car. - Hang on tightly, let go lightly. Chapter five... - Good night? - Not particularly. - And your lady? - She had to leave early. - She asked me to thank you. - Bit unexpected, wasn't it? - Not really, no. - How's that soccer story coming along? - You said it was gonna be social, Giles. No business. He was overcome with a sense of urgency. He had to get it down. Get on with the writing. - It's beautiful, Thank you. - I hope it brings you luck. - It will. I haven't brought you much luck, have I? - Marion, that girl who worked at the casino... - I don't care about her. I was wrong what I said about the book. I hurt you, didn't I? - I'm gonna leave the casino soon, I promise. - You Will? - Within a month. Believe me. I'm gonna quit. - Then you can dye your hair blonde again. - Nobody around. Leave a message after the beep. - I need to see you. - I've moved. I have a new number. It's 4753275. Please call me. - Chapter seven. Jake had decided to see her. The challenge was essential. - Come in. It's not the Ritz, I'm afraid. IS it yes? - Yes. - Thank you. - It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash. You can't afford a decent place. - Life's not fair. - We both know that. - It's all relative, I need money, too. - Do you? - Yes. - Look, the date's not set yet. But I'll call you. One last thing. The man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But... you know how to deal with cheats. - That bruise has cleared up nicely. - Bruise? Yes. Yes, it's better. - I've still got mine. - And your hand, too. - I took the bandage off yesterday. - You want a drink? - No, thank you. I don't think we should meet again. It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you. Question: was he gambling, taking Jam's money? Answer: no. Because he wasn't betting with his own money. He was being paid in advance for a service. In reality, there were two clear elements of risk in this exchange. One, the possibility the cash was counterfeit. Two, the possibility Jani or her creditors would want the money back if the plan failed. To begin with, he put the odds at two against, seven for. He checked a random selection of bills at the bank. They were all good. - Bring me some luck, darling. - So now his odds were decidedly better. He put them at eight to one. The fact that the notes were good gave him one less negative, two minus one. At the same time, mathematically, he had one more positive. Seven plus one. Next stage. He had to be secure at eight to one. Against having to give the money back, So he wouldn't spend it. If after one month no one had approached him, He calculated the odds of keeping it at 2O to one. No more bets. Thank you. After three months, he figured 100 to one no one would turn up. 36. Red. 8O pound. - Cash me in. - How about a little drink to celebrate? - Jake's experiment with the man would prove his point. People don't change. - Damn. - Money down. - Chapter ten. He watched their faces as they lost. Hour after hour, night after night. Relentlessly. He questioned the conventional wisdom that gamblers are self-destructive. He had come to believe that in reality, they want to destroy everyone else. Their families, loved ones, everyone. Fuck over the whole world. Without emotion, he watched them go. Jake stayed. - Nobody around. - Leave a message. - It's set. The day after tomorrow. The 24th. Good luck. It's set. The day after tomorrow. The 24th. Good luck. - Are you ever tempted to gamble? - Never. Why do you ask? - I can just imagine being around so much money - all the time. - Gambling's not about money. - Really? Gambling's about not facing reality, - ignoring the odds. - I must be a fool. I never think about the odds. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪ Chapter 12. - Change. $2,500. Money down. - Two seven five. New dealer. - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. - Can I help you? -18,18,17... 12. 17, 20. No more cards. Larger than ten. - Place your bets, please. - 50. In tens. - Change. '50 pound. Money down. No more bets. Thank you. 23 red. No, I'm sorry, sir. Th... That was a late bet. - You calling me a cheat? - You are a cheat. - I saw you. - I'm talking to you. - It was a la-- - Come on! - Ladies and gentlemen, please be calm. - There is no cause for alarm. Enjoy yourselves. It's Christmas. - How did you know I was here? - I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here. - Did you go to the casino? - Happy Christmas. Now... Noodles or rice? I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend. - There was a message, wasn't there? - It's probably easier for you to eat the rice. - Marion. What did you tell the police? - Nothing about you. - But then, what? - Give up being a croupier, Jack, or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your promise. Simple. Here, use a spoon. - Leave me alone, Marion! - You're already alone. - Marion! Marion! Come here. Come here. Listen. I really don't want to lose you. I'll quit. I swear to you. - Why did you take the money? - I hate public transport. - What? - I want to buy a car. - How can anyone be that naive? - So... how you feeling? - Bruised. - Take as long as you like. Couple of weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. Don't wanna lose you, Jack. You're a good man. - What's this? - Happy New Year. Have a drink on the company. You've earned it. Chapter 13. It's all numbers, the croupier thought. Spin of the wheel, turn of the card, Time of your life, date of your birth, Year of your death. In the book of numbers, the Lord said... Thou shalt count thy steps. Jack thought, this is it. The famous two-in-the-morning knock at the door. It was payback time. But he wasn't afraid. He hadn't spent one penny of the ten grand. He'd covered himself. He knew the odds. - Mr. Manfred? - She was on her way home. - To you. - No, she wasn't. - Marion had been visiting his mother. No, no, no. Not his mother, her mother. Her mother. She was visiting her mother. Who are you? - Detective Inspector Ross. - Who? - Ross. - Who did it? - Tell me. - We think it's a hit and run. A drunk driver, probably. There is the possibility of a revenge killing. - Revenge? For what? Whose revenge? - As you know, she was a WPC with the met. Up until two years ago. She called me last week. She got wind of a planned robbery at your casino. What had that got to do with her death? - You didn't recognize the man who attacked you, did you? - Of course I fucking recognized him. - You did? - I know a cheat when I see one. - The man was a cheat. - If anything occurs to you, call me, will you? ' DO YOU gamble? - I was in love with her, you know. The world breaks everyone. And afterwards, many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break, it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these, you can be sure it will kill you, 1:00. But there will be no special hurry. - Hey! Jacko, how you doing? I heard what happened to the casino. Pity they didn't get away with it. I wish I'd been there. - You were there, mate. - What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me-- Bitch Bella shopped me and you know what I had to do? I had to beat the shit out of her. - You know what I'd like Matt? I'd like to buy you a drink. - Cheers! Congratulations. - Happy New Year. I like you, Jacko. You're so fucking straight. Here, You haven't changed your clothes. The music stopped. Jack was drunk. Hallucinating. He was back. A child in the wild coast casino. - You've been avoiding me. - Have I? - I'm Lucy. - So, what do you do, Lucy? - I'm a witch. A white witch. - Are you gonna put a spell on me? - I might. That's mine. - Fuckin' hell. That's a nice car. How much did you pay for it? - Too much. 1800. I saw her! You don't trust women drivers, do you? Jack didn't trust anyone... Except himself. It was finally finished. He thought of sending it to Giles, But that wouldn't be right. He would select a publisher at random. Like a number. 21,19,13. - Here, please. - 20. 16, 20. Blackjack. - You're wasting yourself. With your luck, you ought to come over to our side. - Even his publisher had no idea who the author was. He had done the deal through a lawyer. It gave him a good feeling, no one knowing. It never occurred to anyone at the casino that the Golden Lion had been his model. Why should it? Weren't all casinos the same? It gave him an exquisite pleasure being an underground man. With all his money, he hadn't even bought a car. Jack knew the truth about himself. He was a one-book writer. A one-time winner who had quit while he was ahead. He changed nothing in the flat. Bought nothing, spent nothing. The only thing he did was to remove the bars outside the window. Nobody around. Leave a message after the beep. - Hello? - Jack, it's Jani. - Jam. Where are you'? - Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months. - So how are you doing? - Great. Listen, I'm getting married. - At least, I think I am. - Did you solve your problems? - Yeah, yeah. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute, there's someone here who wants to talk to you. - Jacko. - Dad. - I never thanked you properly for your help. Jani tells me you behaved like the perfect gentleman. I knew you would, I know my son. The woman thinks I'm gonna marry her. But you know me. Well, it's a shame that things never worked out, but we saw you all right. You didn't gamble the ten grand, did you? - As a matter of fact, I did. - But I won. - That's my boy. How's that novel of yours coming... So that was it. Final card. Blackjack. His father, 8,000 miles and 27 years away was still dealing to his son, Jack, from the bottom of the deck. But Jake the Croupier had a sense of humor. Here's to you. To both of you. - Who was that on the phone? - Couple I know are getting married. - Fools. Now he had reached the point where he no longer heard the sound of the ball. The spin of the wheel had brought him home to the place where he was born. The Croupier's mission was accomplished. He was master of the game. He had acquired the power to make you... lose.
