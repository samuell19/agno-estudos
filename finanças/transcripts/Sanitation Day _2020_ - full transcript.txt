I saw him there like that! -[in Hausa] I didn't kill him. -[women screaming] -[man] Heh! Ehen. -[woman screams] -I said it! He said he'll kill us all. -[woman yells] -[man] He says he'll kill all of us! -[woman in Igbo] Killer! -Heh! -[man two] Call Police! Call Police!

I know what I'm saying. Please call the police. [woman in pidgin] What are you going to do? [in Hausa] I am telling you people, it's not me. I don't know anything about this thing. I swear. Please believe me, it's not me. Run! Lock the gates! -[woman in Igbo] Call them! -Hello. Hello? Police. [dramatic music plays] [woman in Yoruba] Hurry! Where is my money? Answer me, you men.

Don’t give me five hundred, it's too early for that. Alright, alright. What do you want? -Hurry! -Show me what you have. -Ehn? -[man grunts] What are you doing? You messed up my boots! Okay. Okay, okay. [in pidgin] Sir, please don’t be upset. Someone just died. [in pidgin] Someone has been murdered in Baba Risi’s house. [in pidgin] And now the police has been informed. They're on their way. [Friday] Is that why you messed up my boots? What are you people even digging here that you haven’t finished in weeks? Sir, I said I'm sorry. [in pidgin] Don't be upset. [in Yoruba] What's going on? [in English] Where's everybody going? [woman in Yoruba] Look, move out of my way. [in pidgin] Sir, today is Sanitation. If the police meets us here, we are in big trouble! -[in Yoruba] Are you not selling anymore? -[sarcastically in Yoruba] Keep waiting. [sarcastically in Yoruba] I'll just keep selling beans. [in Yoruba] Don’t you know today is Sanitation Day? [man one] Yes, you can go ahead. Okay, no problem. ‪[man two hisses]‬ [man one] What is wrong with you? [man two] It’s some silly laborer at the construction site that poured mud on my boots. I don’t know what kind of stupid well they're digging there. At least he didn’t pour it on your shirt. I would have killed him! Is he mad? He would have been the second dead body the police have come to check. Second... Who’s the first one? [slow hip hop music plays] [in Efik] Did you see the dead man? [in Efik] Leave me alone. [in Efik] Did you see him kill the man? [dramatic music plays] Who is the man? [in pidgin] We don’t know him. [in pidgin] That's the man who killed him. [in Hausa] I’m not the one who killed him! What kind of talk is that? [in Hausa] I don’t even know him. And how do you know he's the one that killed him? [in pidgin] Inspector, why are you talking this way? Huh? [in pidgin] Don't you know these Hausa people? That's how they behave. They just carry their daggers everywhere and go around stabbing people . I beg your pardon! I'm an Hausa man and I do not go about killing people. Heh! [in Igbo] Please, please, please, sorry! [in English] It's a slip of tongue. [in Igbo] Please. -Inspector Stanley… -Sir. interrogate the rest of the housemates. I'd like to talk to them. [Stanley] Um, but sir... um, don’t you think we should call for back up? Just the two of us here is a little-- Is a little what? It's... it's not usual, sir. Are you questioning my judgment? Of course not, sir. I thought so. Get to work. I would like to talk to everybody in this house. [Baba Risi in Yoruba] For what? [in pidgin] I know nothing about it. I just don't know. [in pidgin] That's the person who saw the corpse. I’m told you're the one that saw the suya man kill the man. -[in Efik] What did he say? -Hey. Now, you're going to tell me everything you saw, without lying or holding anything back. -[in Efik] What did he say? -Hey! Ex-- Otherwise, you'll be charged with obstruction of justice. Am I clear? Inspector... Can you let her speak? -[in Efik] What-- -Hey. Speak. [in Efik] What does he want me to say? I don't know what to say. -[in Efik] Speak up. -[in Efik] I don't understand him at all. [in Efik] Tell him... -[in Efik] What does he want me to say? -Can... She doesn't speak English? [sarcastically in pidgin] No, ask her. She will answer you. -[Ekaette in Efik] What-- -[Suzie] Stand here! [in pidgin] She doesn’t speak English. Only Madam Suzie understands her language. [in Efik] What is he saying? I’m.. I’m sorry. Can you translate? [in pidgin] What do you want me to say? Ask her to tell me everything she saw. [in Efik] He wants you to tell him exactly what happened from the beginning. Oh! [dog barking] [soft music plays] [Ekaette in Efik] Every morning, I wake up by 5:00 a.m. My auntie's alarm wakes me to start work for the day. [yawning] [whimpering] [in Efik] That was when I shouted. [sobbing, in Efik] And people started coming out. [in pidgin] She said that was when she yelled, then people started coming out. -[Hassan] Inspector Stanley, it's okay. -[sobs] [in Efik] Stop crying. Wipe your tears. Were you able to get any useful information yet? She said she saw the suya man bent over the dead guy with a knife and blood on his hands. -Doesn’t mean he killed the guy. -Doesn’t mean he did not. I have ordered an ambulance. -An autopsy report-- -Autopsy? Come on, sir. By the time they're done, we would have retired from the Force. So. Are you suggesting that I do not follow due process by filing for one? He is dead! It doesn’t matter. We have a suspect, a murder weapon and a witness. What in God's name do we need, sir? Evidence. Beyond all reasonable doubt. That’s what we need. -Or is his tribe enough evidence for-- -Oh, I didn’t say that, sir. You didn’t have to. Question every single soul in this compound. Find out if anybody saw anything else. They all claim they don’t know this guy. Someone has to know him. Maybe the suya man knows him. Maybe. Maybe not. That’s why we are here. To find out. Sir. [hesitating, in pidgin] It seems Ekaette has remembered something, sir. ‪What?‬ She... she said... um, [in pidgin] she saw Chukwudi and that man fighting. Maybe he killed him. -[Stanley] Is she sure? -[in pidgin] Seems so. [Stanley] What do you mean, [in pidgin] "seems so"? Is she sure or not? ‪[hesitating]‬ [Hassan] Where is this Chukwudi guy? [in pidgin] Sir, that’s him standing over there. [man one in pidgin] Guy, what's going on? Haven't we got to the water level? [in pidgin] Yes we have. We are ready to clear out. You guys should be on standby to pass the bucket. [man one] Oh, okay. [grunts] [in pidgin] What about transportation? [man] Don't worry about that. I've called them. They're on their way. You know we need to finish before the sanitation. I know. Just focus on what you're doing, alright? Okay. -I will call you when I'm ready. -Okay. -[man one] Well done. -Thank you. [in Igbo] Big brother, I don't know why I was brought here. [in Igbo] Big brother, I don't know why I was brought here! [in Igbo] I don’t know anything concerning the police. Why would they bring me here? -[brother] Chukwudi... -Don't call "Chukwudi" here, please. -[in Igbo] Why will they be calling-- -[man] Calm... [in Igbo] Take it easy. They just want to ask you questions. [yelling in Igbo] What do you mean, "they just want to ask me questions?" [in Igbo] What do they want to ask me questions for? [in Igbo] What for? [in Igbo] Er, please. [in pidgin] don’t get upset. You know... [chuckles] matters like this... scare him a bit. Why? He has nothing to be scared of if he's innocent. [nervously] True. That is... that is true. Ask him... Where was he last night? Only that? Er... [clears throat] -Chudi. -[in Igbo] Big brother. [in Igbo] Madam Suzie said she saw you fighting the dead man. [in Igbo] So the police men want to know where-- [in Igbo] Brother, what's the problem? Don't talk like that. [in Igbo] Madam Suzie? Madam Suzie? [in Igbo] Madam Suzie said she saw me with this useless man? [in Igbo] Seems like something is wrong in Madam Suzie’s head. -If I give her a slap, she will go mad. -[in Igbo] That's enough. -Why would she say such silly things? -[in Igbo] That's enough. [in Igbo] That's enough. [in Igbo] My big brother... [grunts] -Huh! -Madam Suzie? [in Igbo] Hmm! No problem, no problem. Are you sure you asked him what I asked you to ask him? -Yes. [chuckles] -[mobile phone ringing] I asked the question you asked me to ask him. So how did "Madam Suzie" get into the translation? Because I clearly did not ask anything about Madam Suzie. Oh, that? Er... [chuckles] [in pidgin] you know, the way you officers ask your questions sometimes... it's difficult to understand properly. So I just helped you elaborate on it for him to understand better. That's why I mentioned Madam Suzie. Who is Yont? [Chukwudi] Hmm? -[piano music plays] -Ask him who Yont is, and what kind of name is that. [in Igbo] Yont? And what has that got to do with anything? He called this Yont a few minutes before we walked in. -Sorry. -So? People will call their friends and family in situations like this. [big brother] Hmm. Mister-- No. Mazi. Mazi Okeke. Hmm. Mr. Mazi... No. [in Igbo] My name is not Mr. Mazi-- -[Chukwudi in Igbo] Hey brother, listen. -[in pidgin] Mazi is a chieftaincy title. [in Igbo] Ajala and I went out last night. [in Igbo] It was last night that Ajala and I went out to drink. It was Ajala and I that went out last night to go and enjoy ourselves. Why do they want to lock me up now? Was I in this house? Was I in this house last night? Was I in this house last night? [spluttering] Was... -[spluttering in Igbo] Was I in the house? -[mumbling] [crying, mumbling] Was I in the house last night? -Who is Ajala? -Sir? He just mentioned "Ajala." Is that an Igbo word or something? No. [in pidgin] Ajala is a name. In fact, it's a person. He's a tenant in the house. What happened with Ajala? [in Igbo] What did you say about Ajala? [in Igbo] Brother, what happened is... Let me tell you the truth. [in Igbo] I closed from work. When I left work, I went to play the lotto, [in Igbo] and luckily I won. [in Igbo] As soon as I got paid, I happily called Ajala my friend and said to him "Ajala, my friend, come let’s go and have a beer." Then we went out and drank and drank some beer. Is drinking a sin? [crying] Just because I called Ajala for both of us to go out and have some beer... [spluttering] I'm being asked about what I know nothing of? [Mazi Okeke] Er... [in pidgin] yesterday, he played the lotto and won some money. You know these things these men play? So he won some cash for himself and called Ajala. He said, "Ajala, come. I've won some money from the lotto. Come, let me buy you a drink." So that’s how he went out to have drinks with Ajala. -Nothing... he didn't do anything else. -So, you’re a gambler? Focus. [muttering, crying] [mumbling] About what time? [in Igbo] When? [spluttering in Igbo] It was at about 8:00 p.m. 8:00 p.m. in the night. That’s when we started drinking. Till about 10:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m. Then we left to sleep. I didn't see anything, officer. [in pidgin] They came out to have drinks at about 8:00 p.m. till 9:00,10:00 p.m. Latest by 11:00 pm, no later. [in pidgin] They didn't stay long. Where is this Ajala now? [Chukwudi] Hmm. [inaudible] ‪[inaudible]‬ ‪[inaudible]‬ ‪[inaudible]‬ [haunting music plays] Have you seen your tenant, Ajala, since yesterday? Ajala? [laughs] That useless boy. [in pidgin] I don’t know why I haven't yet sent him out of my house. -I don't know! -That wasn’t the question. Have you seen Ajala since yesterday? Yes. [in pidgin] I saw him yesterday. Where? [in pidgin] Ajala came to my living room to borrow some money. For what? [laughing hysterically] [in Yoruba] Police... [hysterical laugh continues] [in Yoruba] Police... -[in Yoruba] Are you serious? -[laughs] [laughing] Oh, police... [laughing] Are you serious? ‪[everyone laughs]‬ ‪-Ah. Oh. [laughs]‬ ‪-[tenants laughs]‬ Ah, [in Yoruba] Police. And what is funny? [in pidgin] The question you asked. That means you don’t know Ajala. Obviously. If not, I wouldn't be here asking you about him now, would I? [in pidgin] If Ajala begs you for money, it means he needs some alcohol. And did you give him? [in pidgin] Why would I give him? Am I running a charity? Give him? I didn't give him. [in pidgin] Honestly, I should have eaten before leaving my house. [in pidgin] I am so hungry now. Friday! You and food. My brother, food is man’s best friend. [in pidgin] Something you know well. [in pidgin] I thought it was a dog. [in pidgin] Yes, if you can eat it. -[laughs] -Looks like you've not been to Calabar. -[crashing sound] -[dog barks] -[in pidgin] What is that? -Ah. [in pidgin] How would I know? Aren't we here together? [in pidgin] But you heard something, right? [in pidgin] I’m sure it’s nothing. How can you say it’s nothing? After I told you that someone died in Baba Risi’s compound. So? What if that's the killer? Hey, Friday. [in pidgin] I worked here all night and nobody came here. [in pidgin] Did the people in Baba Risi’s compound not sleep there all night? [in pidgin] Yet, a dead body was found. Guy, let’s go. Go where? You and who? -[in pidgin] Please. -[in pidgin] So you scare easily? No, this is not fear, my guy. This is common sense. [in pidgin] If you get there and meet the killer, what would you do? Oh ho! [in pidgin] Did you think about that? [in pidgin] Please let me be. [in pidgin] What is it? Really? Half bread is better than no puff-puff. Guy, let’s go! Wait. Really. Guy, this is a bad idea. Look, let us go back. We can be superheroes if we catch this guy. Right here, right now. Or we can be dead men if we don’t. I don't like this. Something must kill a man. Why? [man two] What is it? [Friday in pidgin] Wow. Okay. You've seen what has caused the problem. Can we go? Go where? Won’t we pack it up? Pack what? Do you know how long it will take to pack these things? So let’s go back to the gate house. When the cleaners come, they will take care of it. No. Friday! Madam must not see us here. I... So... You agree he was here yesterday to drink? In the afternoon? [in pidgin] He came to my shop to drink yesterday. [in pidgin] He was drinking till night. He even stole my drink. After your investigation, arrest him. What time? [in pidgin] I didn’t check time. I don’t have a wrist watch. You said he was here till night. What time at night? [in pidgin] It should be around eight o' clock. Are you sure? [in pidgin] He left around when Muslims are calling for prayer. [in pidgin] That’s when he left. It was night. Was he with anyone? No. Are you sure? Because Chukwudi claims he was here with Ajala yesterday drinking. And they were here till 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. -[in pidgin] I don’t know. -You do not know what, exactly? That they were here together? That they had drinks together? Or they left, which one? What exactly don’t you know? Sir, Chukwudi came here to drink. [in pidgin] He even bought drinks for some people. They all sat at the same table. He came alone. When he finished, he left at night with the guys. So you admit that he bought him drinks? Sir, he bought drinks. They sat here at the table drinking. They were discussing in their language. I don't speak the Igbo language, so I don’t know... what they were discussing but when they were done drinking, they all left. -[Madam Suzie in pidgin] Please... -[Hassan] I see. Alright, Madam Suzie, thank you very much. That will be all for now. [slow hip hop music playing] Sir, there is something really fishy about these people. Their stories don’t add up at all. I agree. Their accounts and timings of last night's events... are all muddled up. I guess. It’s either they all have very bad memories, or they know who killed this man and are all covering up for the killer. Chukwudi is the prime suspect right now. [Stanley] And the suya man? [Hassan] Not really. The only thing tying him to this crime are the things Ekaette said. [Stanley] And the knife, sir? [Hassan] The knife... The man did not die by a knife wound. [loud banging on iron gate] Who is that? -[loud banging on iron gate] -[female voice] Umaru! [female voice in Hausa] I'm looking for Umaru, -I want to collect my money. -[Umaru spluttering indistinctly] [muffled voice] [Baba Risi] Mm-hmm? [in Hausa] It’s Umaru that am looking for. ‪[Baba Risi] Really?‬ ‪Tsk.‬ [Madam Suzie in Efik] You! Come back in here. [slow music plays] Kai! Kai! [in pidgin] What am I doing here? That's a good question. Who are you? And what do you want? Umaru! Umaru! [in pidgin] I'm here to collect my money. Because I went to look for him where he sells suya and I didn't find him. That's why I decided to come to collect my money before he travels. [in pidgin] And where is he going? I don’t know. He didn't say. He just told me that he will be traveling soon. Do you still think he’s innocent, sir? [in Hausa] I don't want the money anymore! I don't want! -Get up! Get up! -[Umaru grunts] [in Hausa] Leave her alone. Please, she knows nothing about the situation. [yelps, in Hausa] I don't want! [in Hausa] She has no hand in this. Please, leave her alone. Let her go. [in Hausa] What kind of problem is this? Shut up! -[woman in Hausa] See what you've-- -[wailing] -[Umaru in Hausa] Didn't you come here? -[people wailing, yelling] [people lamenting] [woman in pidgin] Has he died? [man in pidgin] Don't joke with death. [in pidgin] The Sanitation Task Force is still very much around. [in pidgin] If they see it and catch you, they will arrest you, I tell you. [in pidgin] Arrest me, how? -[in pidgin] Can the wind be arrested? -Is that so? -Tsk. -[man in Igbo] I hear you. -This man. Ajala-- -[Hassan] What is going on here? [woman in pidgin] Officer, it's... [Chukwudi in Igbo] Goodness! Hey! -[Ekaette in Efik] Goodness! -[Chukwudi] Hey, hey! -[Chukwudi in Igbo] God... my God! -[woman in Hausa] Goodness! -Is he okay? -[Chukwudi in Igbo] Brother Ajala. -I don’t know, officer. -[Chukwudi in Igbo] What happened? I don’t know. -[Chukwudi in Igbo] Is he dead? -[woman, man] I don’t know. -[Chukwudi in Igbo] Has he died? Hmm! -[woman, man] Ha! -[Ekaette in Efik] Who is it? -[people whispering] Ah, Ajala. Are you people joking? And you stood there doing nothing? [people muttering] [people muttering in different languages] -[Ekaette in Efik] How did it happen? -[woman] I don't know. This strong cat. [Hassan] He's breathing. What are you doing? [Hassan] Trying to remember CPR. ‪-Tsk.‬ ‪-[Hassan] What are you doing?‬ [grunts] [yells] Are out of your mind? [comic music playing] Well... it worked. [groaning] Where am I? [woman in pidgin] I'll pack out from this house because of you! [woman in pidgin] One day, you'll get us into trouble. -[Madam Suzie] Everyday, this nonsense! -[man] Can you imagine this? [woman in pidgin] One day, you'll get all of us in this house into trouble. [women complaining] -[Hassan] Hey, hey! -[Stanley] Quiet. [tenants] Sorry, sir. [Hassan] Are you okay? [woman in Igbo] My goodness. [in Yoruba] Where am I? [tenants complaining in various languages] -[woman in pidgin] Ajala is a filthy man. -[others complaining] -[Hassan] Get him up. -[Stanley] Get up. Get up! -[man in pidgin] He never listens. -[woman in pidgin] He never listens. -[tenants complaining in their languages] -Give me my beer, I'm thirsty. [tapping sound] Drink. Huh? [in Yoruba] Should I drink? [in Yoruba] This is water. Tsk. Get me Baba Risi. I’m going to need an interpreter. Why? What is this, the Olympics? Why? Just go. With all due respect, sir, I do not understand why we're wasting our time on this guy when we can interrogate the suya man and find out where he was last night. Inspector Stanley... [tense music plays] I'm beginning to find your insubordination very annoying. I’m sorry. [in Yoruba] Look, Mr. Police, [in Yoruba] all this talk is... May I go? All this talk is giving me a headache. [in Yoruba] Can I take my leave? Get me Baba Risi. Now! [in Yoruba] Please let me go. I have a bad headache. -Are you okay? -Huh? [soft music playing] [in pidgin] Here I am, officer. [Hassan] Baba Risi… It appears Ajala here doesn't understand English. [in pidgin] No, he doesn’t understand English. [in pidgin] He doesn't understand it at all. Only Yoruba? [in pidgin] He understands only Yoruba language. In that case, you're going to be my interpreter. [Baba Risi] Really? Hmm. Okay. Get me Chukwudi. So... Ask him... where he was last night. [Baba Risi in Yoruba] Mr. Man... [in Igbo] My friend, I hope you know that you caused all this. -[in Yoruba] Who is this? -[in Igbo] We were drinking last night. [in Igbo] I hope you won't go and say something else. ‪[in Yoruba] Do you understand‬ ‪what he's saying?‬ -[in Igbo] We were drinking last night. -[Chukwudi grunts] -[Ajala] Woah. -[Chukwudi grunts] Inspector Stanley! What was that for? He needs to shut up! [in Igbo] Why? -[in Igbo] What did you slap me for? -You are still talking! -[in Igbo] Why did you slap me? -You'll speak when you’re spoken to. ‪Shut up!‬ [yelling] Of course he is still talking, he doesn’t understand you! [in Igbo] If not because you're officers, I would have slapped you back. -[in Igbo] If not-- -[yells] Hey! [Ajala laughs] Officer, sorry. Baba, it’s not your fault. -Oh, but it is your fault. -Ah? Why would you take in people who cannot speak English, let alone Pidgin? [yelling] How do they get by? How? Inspector Stanley! [in Yoruba] Do you want to beat me? That is none of our concern. Can we please focus on what our concern is, which is finding the killer? ‪[Ajala laughs]‬ [in Yoruba] The slap was a hot one. [laughs] Ask him... if he was with Chukwudi last night. [in Yoruba] He said, were you with Chukwudi last night? -Chukwudi? -[in Yoruba] Yes. The same Chukwudi. [in Yoruba] I don’t know who Chukwudi is. I don't this person. [in Yoruba] You don’t know Chukwudi? [in Yoruba] I don’t know... Who? Who is his father in this town? I don’t know him. -Ahn-ahn! -Yes. Chukwudi! -What's happening? -[in Yoruba] Don't know him never met him. [in pidgin] I suspected as much. [in pidgin] He hasn't yet recovered from the alcohol he took. He said he doesn’t know Chukwudi. He lives with Chukwudi in this house. -Yes. -Chukwudi. [in Yoruba] Baba Risi, I don’t know him! -[Baba Risi in Yoruba] Ah. Imagine. -[in Yoruba] Look... [in Yoruba] Mr. Officer, I'm not comfortable with all these interrogations. [in Yoruba] Please let me go and find Jonah. There's something [in Yoruba] we've not finished discussing. [in Yoruba] I need to find Jonah. I hope you understand. What’s he saying? [in pidgin] He said he doesn't know Chukwudi. [in pidgin] But he needs to find Jonah. He said he and Jonah have an unfinished deal together. Yes, Jonah. Yes. [in Yoruba] Why is he looking at me? [in Yoruba] Dip your finger in his eyes. Where is this Jonah guy? [in Yoruba] Yes. He’s an Igbo guy. Jonah. Jonah. -[door rattles] -Tsk. I would have gone since, but for that silly Iya Tawa that had to sit down and pick beans outside. [tearfully] All her mates are busy looking at a dead body outside. Babe, you know you could have gone when everyone was running to the back to see what was happening at the bathroom. You could have just gone then. How? Didn’t you see Baba Cletus coming out of his room? He... he wasn't even looking in your direction. -You wouldn't-- -What if he had turned and looked? -You know he and his wife like to gossip. -Shh, shh. -[whimpering] -Just calm down. ‪-Okay? Just stay calm. Hey, come here.‬ ‪-Tsk.‬ -[whimpering] -It'll be fine. Just relax. All we need is perfect timing. We'll be fine. That's all. Not a big deal. Okay? I don’t hear anything so I think this is the perfect time for us to move. -Right? -Hmm! No, Jonah, no. I’m scared. -No! -Babe, we can't.... We can’t just stay in here. Your parents are going to start looking for you sooner or later. [explodes] That’s if they... [low voice] That's if they've not already. Just... hey baby, relax. Trust me, please. Just follow me and you'll be fine. Okay? Please. Ehn? Please. -[whispers] Yeah. -[whispering] Okay, let's go. [tense music playing] [whispering] People are coming, go, go back in. [Jonah clears throat] [hesitating] Beautiful morning, isn’t it... officers? There is a dead man outside on the floor. What do you think? I... I... I guess not. So you are Jonah? Yes, sir. [clears throat] Yes, sir. And this is your room? -This one, sir? -Uh-uh. The one in the sky. Are you going to answer the question? Or do you want to continue this down at the station? There...there's no need for that, officer. It's... I'm sorry it's, um... [hesitating] No, sir. I mean, yes, sir. It's... it's, er... It’s my door. Sorry, my room. And you have been inside the whole time? No ,sir. I... I mean... yes, sir. I... I... I was... sleeping, sir. [Baba Risi sighs] Sleeping? Through all this noise, sleeping? Um... [hesitates] I’m a deep sleeper. Very deep. When I sleep, I don't hear anything. [man in Igbo] You're lying. Don't mind him. [Baba Cletus in pidgin] But I saw you outside. Ahn-ahn. Me? Uh-uh. When? [Baba Cletus in Igbo] Bloody liar! Ha, Jonah! Step aside. [hesitates] Sir, what did you say? [in pidgin] Get out of the way! I thought you were just stupid. So, it appears you're deaf as well. Now, move... -or you will be moved. -[Ekaette] Hey! [tenants complaining] Officer, [hesitates] it hasn't reached... [Hassan] Step. Aside. [tense music plays] [tenants protesting] [tense music playing] -[man in Igbo] Wait, wait. -[man in Yoruba] Leave me alone... -[man in Igbo] Let me pass. -[Ajala in Yoruba] What's wrong with you? -[man in Igbo] Get out of the way. -[Ekaette in Efik] What's the matter? [Ajala in Yoruba] Kai! Why are you acting like... [Ekaette in Efik] Why is he acting... -[Ajala in Yoruba] What are you doing? -[in pidgin] You don't know young men. [Mazi Okeke] Hmm. Tsk. [in pidgin] Maybe he's hiding some weed to smoke. [Jonah] Don't even listen to him. I don't smoke. I don’t even smoke, sir. Look at your eyes! [in Igbo] What? -Huh? -[Jonah] Nothing, nothing. Nothing! [in Igbo] Step aside. Hey! Huh? -[tenants lamenting] -Huh? [dramatic music playing] [yells] Hey! [Mazi Okeke in Igbo] Oh my God. -Nkechi! -[softly] Papa. -[Ajala laughs] -[Nkechi squeaks] ‪-[Mazi Okeke] Come.‬ ‪-[Ajala laughs]‬ [Ajala in Yoruba] You have been exposed. [Ajala in Yoruba] Jonah! Strong warrior. You're brave. I trust you. You! -[Mazi Okeke] Nkechi! -[tenants mutter] Hey! -What are you doing here? -[whimpers] -Huh? -[whimpers] Half naked. Nkechi. -[Ajala in Yoruba] She is an Igbo girl. -Ah! This girl has killed me! -Nkechi. -Papa. -Talk. Talk to me. -[whimpers] Ah! This is what you have been hiding? -[Mazi Okeke] Today, I'll kill you today. -[Ajala in Yoruba] He took off his shoes. -[Mazi Okeke] I will kill... -[Ajala in Yoruba] He took off his shoes. -Let nobody stop me. -[tenants chatter] -Today, I will kill you today. -[Ajala in Yoruba] You're dead today. You! I... Hey. Officer, no! Officer, uh-uh! Let me kill... Rapist! -[laughs, in Yoruba] Jonah you're dead. -Don’t call me a rapist. She came here on her own, willingly. Don’t call me a rapist, please. ‪[Hassan] Calm down.‬ Oh okay. Thank you. Let me get it. No, no. That's a vital point. She came, willingly [chuckles] and you… uh-huh. [chuckles] Willingly! Right? It's okay! Since today is a "willingly" day, I will kill you, willingly. -[Hassan] Mr. Man... -[squeals] Papa, wait! [Jonah] Officer! Please, hold him, hold him. -[Ajala in Yoruba] You are dead today. -Officer, officer! Please, hold him. [in Yoruba] This is not good, Jonah. [Ajala in Yoruba] For a while, you've been having an affair with her, day and night. This is not good. -[Ajala in Yoruba] Ah. You are dead. -[Mazi Okeke yelling] [Ajala in Yoruba] You're a dead man today, you don't know anything. [Ajala in Yoruba] Leave him! Let him... Officer... [Ajala in Yoruba] You're a dead man today, you don't know anything. [Ajala in Yoruba] It's not good. Oh, he's coming to deal with you. [snickers] Iya Tawa. -Yes? -[laughs] [in pidgin] So this is how Nkechi sneaks to Jonah's room every night? [in pidgin] Exactly. These small children of nowadays. [laughs] [in pidgin] They are so wayward. Hmm. My sister. [in pidgin] Today is her unlucky day. I'm sure that the problem today that has made everyone stay outside their rooms has prevented her from sneaking back into her parents' house like she normally does. [scoffs] Ah, Nkechi. [in pidgin] I would never have believed that she could do that kind of nonsense, especially with that useless boy, Jonah. [in pidgin] Why are you surprised? This is not her first time. That girl is too loose. If you try to tell her father, he would never believe you. You can’t blame Papa Nkechi. The girl is beautiful and intelligent. Would you believe a girl of her caliber could act that way, with that useless boy? Now you have witnessed it yourself. -Ah. [chuckles] -That girl... she wears bum shorts and half tops around to seduce people. Iya Tawa! I know you. You didn't do well. You knew all this and kept it away from me all this while. I thought we were friends. -Um... -Huh? Um, I... -I don’t want you to put me in trouble. -Ah. What's that about? What trouble? Since you sometimes leave her with your husband, Papa Cletus. Ehn, ehn, ehn. [in pidgin] Iya Tawa! You've not done well, you've not done well at all. So you've known this all along, and you allow me, your girl, to leave Nkechi with Papa Cletus to teach my children. Eh? [in pidgin] I thought you were aware but just had the mind to ignore. That's all. What kind of mind is that? Ah! Papa Cletus has killed me. I am finished. He must have had an affair with her, considering how light skinned she is. Slim and also... Oh God! After all my sacrifices for that useless man! You! Papa Cletus, come here. [in pidgin] Useless man! So you're an having affair with Nkechi. -[in pidgin] Relax. Don't hurt him. -Why won't I hurt him? -[Iya Tawa] Hey! -I'll kill you today! ‪-Why? Why?‬ ‪-After all my sacrifices. What have you...‬ I don’t know him. [in Igbo] I’m on my own, please. I don’t know him. I thought you said you didn’t know the dead guy. Well... I... [in pidgin] I don’t really know him well. We only see once a while and greet each other sometimes. Nothing more. [scoffs] Just greet. Just greet? [chuckles] Ah. [in Igbo] Alright... -[in Igbo] see it there. -[man laughs] [man] Play! [man in pidgin] You are scared, right? [chuckles] You are scared. Play the game! -Or should we cancel this round? -Hmm. [in Igbo] Oh my God! [in Igbo] Come on, this boy. You are using black magic. Okay. No problem. Now, I want to take this game very seriously. When money is involved, Mazi Okeke is very serious. 2000! Bring your own, let's play the game. [chuckles] You don't know anything. [in Igbo] Bro, look at this young man. He says he can beat me in the game of checkers. -Ahn-ahn. -Huh? [chuckles] Tell him! [in pidgin] Tell him that I am Mazi Okeke. Odenigbo one, of not only my village, but of the entire Checkers Ministry! You don't need to say much. This night, he will know. Let's go. Jonah will be my witness. He will witness how I will dismember you. -[chuckling] -[Jonah] Let me just... [Mazi Okeke] What is it? What is it? [in pidgin] Ehn? Who invited you? I thought you wanted me to be your… You thought. Thought what? Go on. Don't witness again. -Mazi. -[yells] Go. [in pidgin] Leave please. Come! Come, come. Who did you leave this for? Right. Start the game. So... so just greet? -Only greet? -Only greet! -Yes! -[in Igbo] It’s okay. Only greet. Hmm. [in pidgin] You'd better speak up. Tell them how you and the man went drinking together. Confess. What? [hesitating] Officer, trust me it's nothing like that, at all. [yelling] So how was it? How? [Jonah] I was sitting on my own, relaxing with this very chilled bottle of beer, when the man walked in. Sweet boy, [in pidgin] how are you? Ekaette is inside. He went to meet Madam Suzie and placed his order. Pepper soup and beer. I know because he asked Ekaette for his bill. I told him she does not speak English and I signaled to Ekaette what he was saying. Ekaette tells him how much, and he pays. As soon as she goes, he walks over to my table. So... what happened after that? He started talking to me. About? Just this and that. Young man... this is a police interrogation. Answers like, "just this and that" will get you thrown in jail. [protests] Especially in a murder case. So, care to try again? Sirs, honestly, it was nothing serious. Nothing serious at all. He only asked my name and what I do. And what do you do? Just this and that... [thump] I'm a business man. I’m into business. Anyway, soon after our conversation, I left him with Madam Suzie, so she's the one you should be asking what happened to the guy. Ehn, true. [in pidgin] He came here to drink. But a while ago, you gave us the impression that you did not know this man. [in pidgin] It’s not what you think, sir. Before yesterday, ‪I'd never seen him.‬ ‪But he came here to drink.‬ When he finished his drink, he left. So... when he left, where did he go? [in pidgin] I don't know. When Jonah asked me later where his friend went, I told him I didn't know. Friend? Yes. That’s how he addressed him. [muttering] So, why did you say you don’t know this guy, when clearly he is your friend? Sir? Me? My friend? [spluttering] How? Madam Suzie. She says you described him as that. Your friend. Me, I des... Hey! Officers, please. No. He is not my friend. He is not my friend at all. When I went to his table, -all I said to him was-- -Wait, wait, wait. I thought you said he came to your table. It's an error. It's a mistake. I was the one that went to his table. Officers, I told you, I'm a business man. As a young hustling boy, I only went to discuss business with him-- [loudly] So you lied to gentlemen of the Force? You lied! Officer, it was not the intention. I did not do it intentionally. I only went to introduce myself to him. And after that, I went to the toilet to ease myself. When I came back, Madam Suzie said he had left. [slaps hands] That's all. So... what did you do? Sir? [tense music playing] [Jonah] I hurried out. I... I saw him giving some money to Ekaette and he was rubbing her hand. [in Efik] Why are you shaking? -[in Efik] Come out here. -[whimpering] Sister. -[in Efik] You don't remit money received. -Sister, sister... [in Efik] Sister, it’s not like that. -[in Efik] Then how was it? -[in Efik] It's not the money for drinks. [in Efik] I'll strip you naked. [in Efik] How much did he give that you refused to give to me? [in Efik] Which money is it? -[in Efik] What money? What do you sell? -[groans] People tend to reveal a lot when they're angry. They're not even speaking English. It doesn’t matter. We still might be able to get something. -[in Efik] What are you selling? -[whimpering] [in Efik] Lie down here. I'll strip you naked. -Don’t kill her. -Shut up! [Hassan] That’s enough! It's either you shut up, or you speak English! -[in Efik] What's the money for? -[in Efik] It's not for the drinks. [in pidgin] Officer, I've caught her. [in pidgin] I've caught her. She says she knows the dead guy. They were having an affair. [ululates] -[Madam Suzie] Prostitute! -[woman] Ekaette! [Madam Suzie] Animal! You wanted to come to Lagos. -[Madam Suzie in pidgin] Curse her, all! -[tenants arguing] [gun shot] [dramatic music plays] What's that for? Well, now that we have your attention... what exactly is the problem? [tenants arguing] -[Chukwudi] He's the problem. -[Ajala in Yoruba] Baba, he's the one. [tenants mumbling] [in pidgin] Guy, what about the transportation? They will soon come. [in pidgin] What's that about? Are you watching the time? Guy, I'm watching the time. Just focus on the work you are doing. [in pidgin] We have finished. All that's left is to bring out things. Please sort it out. Hurry up. [tenants arguing] [in pidgin] Hey, don't pull this thing! Those two shouldn’t be together, sir. Like you should not have fired your gun? With all due respect, sir, I fired my gun to maintain some semblance of sanity. I already expressed my concerns about just the two of us being here at this murder scene. [tenants arguing] So far, so good. [soft music playing] -We haven’t done badly. -[tenants arguing] Are we talking about the same crime scene? 'Cause ever since we got here, it's been one chaos after another. I suggest we take these suspects down to the station for proper interrogation. We can’t take the suspects to the station for interrogation without a dead body, now. Can we? -I’ve been thinking, sir. -That? This guy spoke Efik, Yoruba, and Igbo. And yet no one seems to know him, or know anything about him. Everyone is lying here, sir. They're playing us. This isn't going to end well. ‪[in Hausa] Sir, please what's the time?‬ What did he say? He asking what the time is. Like he has anywhere to be. The only place he has to be... is the station. Now where is that damn ambulance? I’ll just call them. Where is Ekaette? [in pidgin] I sent her to get me something. What? It's my phone. I'm sure I've got many missed calls on it. You are joking! She's a prime suspect in the investigation and you sent her to get a phone? [in Efik] Give me my phone, useless girl. Tsk. [in Efik] I'm sorry. [in pidgin] Officer, don't be upset about what I said earlier-- You are going with us to the station. -[in pidgin] For what? -Don’t ask me stupid questions, woman! When you get there, you'll explain yourself. You're silly. ‪[mobile phone rings]‬ -[in Efik] See what you've caused? -[Stanley] Hey! Hello? Hello! [man] Sorry, sir. We are very close. Just down the road. Yes, sir. I understand. We will be there soon. ‪[door closing and bolt locking]‬ What did I miss? Madam Suzie and Ekaette are going with us to the station. I also think we should interrogate this Chukwudi guy properly on his whereabouts from last night. And who this Yont guy is... Why do you say so? Instinct. The Yont guy called again but... when he heard my voice, he hung up. You should have envisaged what would happen. You shouldn’t have picked the call. Anyway, we’ll sort that out at the station. Yes, sir. Any word on the ambulance? Yes. They'll be here soon. [engine starts] [gas revved] [slow hip hop music playing] [sighs] [in Yoruba] Thank God! [in pidgin] The corpse is finally moved. [arguments in different languages] [Chukwudi] Shut up! [Umaru in Hausa] Let's have some silence, for God's sake! [Hassan] What’s the problem? [Stanley] The car isn't starting. Try it again. [engine stalls] Open the bonnet. [Chukwudi in Igbo] They just abandon us here in the car. [Umaru in Hausa] You people should stop behaving like children for God's sake. [Ajala in Yoruba] What is your business in all this? -[Chukwudi in Igbo] They treat us... -[Ajala in Yoruba] Don’t touch me. [Umaru in Hausa] Am I the person you are fighting with? -[Ajala in Yoruba] Don’t just touch me. -[Jonah in pidgin] I just want to plan... [Umaru in Hausa] What's wrong with you? Isn't that the person you're upset with? [Ajala in Yoruba] What is he saying? -[Ajala in Yoruba] What's he saying? -[Okeke in pidgin] You know you're big. [Hassan] Shut up! We’re going to need a mechanic. I don't think anyone can get here on time, sir. Then we have to call the office to come with a van. That's a no, sir. The other truck overheated yesterday. It can’t get here. Great. Here’s what we do. I'll go with one half in the ambulance, to the office, and then I'll come back for the rest of you later. Are you sure that's wise, sir? -Do you have a better alternative? -I'm just saying. Now, it’s better that half are at the office, than everybody being stuck here with you. Fine. So which ones are you taking? You, out. You. You, out. -[Ajala in Yoruba] What did you say? -You, out. [Ajala in Yoruba] Am I talking to you? Hassan! [in Hausa] You're not leaving me here with him, are you? [in Hausa] I am not staying with him. I am going with you! [Stanley] Shut up! Shut up. Please, sir. Take this one away before I do something stupid. [Hassan in Hausa] Alright, let's go. [soft music plays] [man] This is a high profile job. It will require some role acting, and a considerable time of our lives. And how much time, are we talking about here? [man] About a year. [chuckles] One year. That’s serious. That’s a long time. [man] So is the returns. You'll never have to work a day more in your life. [Ajala] Really? So exactly how much are we talking about? How much do people use in running elections? [dramatic music plays] So... What is the plan? I am going to die. ‪[dramatic music continues]‬ This is our target. This is the decoy. And right here is our base. -There’s nothing there. -I know. We are going to dig something there. [Umaru] What? A well. In reality, it will be a tunnel. That will be our access to the target. Hold up. I’m a bit confused here. Are you insinuating we're all going to pass through the tunnel to get the money? Not you. You will be at the decoy. Doing what exactly? -[loud footsteps] -[Hassan] The four of you... will be at the scene of the murder investigation creating as much confusion and chaos as possible. That will take away attention from the target while the operation is ongoing. And how on earth are we supposed to be creating this confusion? [laughs] Babel. [Ajala] Ba... Babel. Guy, must everything about you be complicated? What is Babel? I'm sorry, guys. Sorry. The last time I checked, I know every single person here except this guy. So... who are you? -This is Inspector Hassan. -What? The law enforcement agent that will arrest you guys. [all] Oh no, no, no. He makes sure we all get out of there. -[Chukwudi] What? -[Umaru] What are you talking ab..? This is a crazy idea. -I swear to God, this is a crazy idea. -Police? I know, I know. But we’ll be fine. [Ekaette] You're going to die? I’ll be fine. What if you’re not? [Ekaette] What if something goes wrong? [tense music playing] ‪[mouthing inaudibly] Shh.‬ [inaudible] ‪[mouthing inaudibly] What? I don't know.‬ ‪[mouthing inaudibly] Is he alive?‬ ‪[mouthing inaudibly]‬ ‪He's supposed to be dead.‬ ‪[mouthing inaudibly] Stick to the plan.‬ [in Efik] What? What is it? [in Efik] Did you kill him? [yelling] They've killed someone! [yelling in Efik] They've killed someone! [in Efik] Come out! Come out! [yelling in Efik] They've killed someone! They've killed someone! [yelling in Efik] Come out! Come out! Come out! [yelling in Efik] They've killed someone! [in Efik] They've killed someone! Come out! So... we stick to the plan no matter what. But even the best plan could actually go wrong. [tense music plays] [inaudible] ‪[inaudible]‬ ‪[inaudible]‬ ‪[tense music still playing]‬ [man] Sorry, I’m late. I had to pick a bag. Mr. Tony, thank you for coming. Anything for you. [laughs] You're crazy. You know that, right? He briefed me. [Chukwudi] Guy... who is he? This, here, is Mr. Tony. He’s my eyes and ears. He's more like my link between the target and the decoy. ‪[dog barking]‬ [in pidgin] What's up? Tony, he’s dead. Okay. Tony. Tony, you're not getting exactly what I'm talking about. ‪He's really, really dead!‬ -Ehn?! -[mutters in disgust] What are you doing? You've messed up my boots! [whimpering] You know what? We need to still stick to the plan. Make sure we stick to the plan. Right? Okay. [crying] Shit. I can’t do it alone. I need more men. Those who'll dig... and those who'll get the prize. That’s a lot of people, man. Well, a job of this magnitude demands a lot of men. You know at some point, someone is definitely going to talk ‪or act out of character.‬ I agree. Well. My men aren't the ones who are role playing here. You are. [laughs] -[chuckles] -Are you kidding me? Men are gonna be digging a tunnel for months, without asking questions? Oh, they're allowed to ask questions. We just won’t give them the answers. At least not all of them. Look, only a handful of our diggers will know what our operation is all about. For the rest, it'll be honest laborers who are digging a tunnel for money for their family, even for weeks. [laughing] How is that going to be possible? Don’t worry about my part. Okay? Just... It’s not a big deal. But yours, on the other hand, is. Imagine what it'd be like if you were to fall out of character? [mumbling] Who... who's this? [muttering] What's he talking about? [Umaru] If that is the case, we all have to improvise. [Chukwudi] Okay. [Chukwudi] How do you intend to get everyone into the house and settled in, months before the actual operation? [man] These two... are our links in. [tense music playing] [inaudible] ‪[inaudible]‬ [Ekaette] I think we should have a run through of the process for the pay day. Okay. I come into the compound... interact with a few people so I'm remembered. Bro, [chuckles] [in Igbo] look at this young boy. He said he will beat me in this game of checkers. Tell him! Tell him that this is Mazi Okeke! The Odenigbo one of not just my village, of the entire Checkers playing industry. [chuckling] In fact, Jonah will be our witness. [Mazi Okeke in Igbo] What? Huh? What is it? I don’t want a witness anymore. Go. Go please! Come back here. Who did you leave this chair for? [inaudible] Do you really have to put up an act of an actual fight? Why can’t you just lie down and pretend to be dead? What if someone is watching? This has to look as real as possible. Have you rehearsed? You never allow us to do that. There's no need for that. I’ll see the boys and we’ll get the ball rolling. And the rest is up to you. [Ajala] And the money? How do we move it? [man] Based on the intel I have, the cash comes in &lrm;"Ghana-Must-Go" bags And what happens after that? [Tony] We load the money into the getaway van. [slow hip hop music playing] [car doors closing] We’re set! What I do not understand is why we need a decoy. Why don’t we just break through the front door and steal the money? I mean, cart away the entire thing. [chuckles] Yeah. But our man here likes complicated. No. You don’t keep ten million dollars in an office without some advanced security system. We can’t risk it. [Chukwudi] Yes, okay, we can’t risk it. [Chukwudi] But, we can risk living false lives? Digging a well for a year. Right? -Right? -[man] Yes, I believe we can. If we stick to the way I've planned things... and if we stick to time. [tense music playing] We need to get out of here. I swear to God. We don't have any more time. Man, we need to leave here, quickly. I was just about to say the same thing. Has Tony called you? You know, that idiot took my phone. Maybe he’s called Umaru. [clears throat] Are you sure? I don't even know where that one kept his phone. [in Yoruba] Don’t touch me. What’s wrong with you? [in Igbo] You need to behave yourself, or else. [in Yoruba] Are you mad? Is something wrong with you? [Chukwudi] I see we have everything down to a T, except one thing. -[Ekaette] Two. -Hey, I speak first. We cause all the chaos, get ourselves roped in as suspects? And he comes in and arrests us, right? Dude. We all know that you guys move in pairs, so... And your question is, how I intend to get rid of the people I work with? [Chukwudi] Of course. That’s my business. Listen. With all due respect, officer, it’s my life here, so I have the right to know. Do you understand me? I have the right to know. When I get the call, I know who exactly to pick to come with me. He’s usually very forward and can be quite restless, which means, he won’t be able to piece the puzzle together quickly but... he is very smart. And I dare say, extremely smart. So, we all have to maintain our covers, at all times. So... how do you plan to get us into the van? Now where the hell is the damn ambulance? I’ll call again to find out. Hello? [whispers] Where the hell are you? Sorry, sir. We are very close. Just down the road. Listen. This only works if you stick to time. Yes, sir. I understand. We will be there very soon. Got it. ‪[exhales]‬ [sighs] I order him to throw you in the ambulance and... we’re home and dry. -[Jonah] That’s if nothing goes wrong. -Nothing... will go wrong [Ekaette] Are you sure? Not even in the dying minute? Nothing. Mr. Friday. [in pidgin] I have closed for the day. [man] See you later. [car horn] [tense music playing] I wonder what that commotion was all about. [woman screams] So, what was your question? Huh? You said there was one more thing we had not figured out. Oh, it wasn't a question, just an observation. It will be a hard sell to get Baba Risi to rent his house to a Hausa and Igbo man when they don’t speak English, not even pidgin. She has a point. When the body is discovered, someone needs to call the police. We need to make sure it comes to me. [soft music playing] [soft music continues] We should celebrate. And young man... you are so lucky. Your fortune just changed. Here’s to stealing from those thieves. [tenants arguing] -[Mazi Okeke] You. You're the problem. -Idiot. [Hassan] Were you able to get any useful information yet? [slow hip hop music playing] [Stanley] She said she saw the suya guy bend over the dead guy with a knife, and blood on his hands. [Hassan] Doesn’t mean he killed the guy. [Stanley] Doesn’t mean he did not. [Stanley] But a while ago, you gave us the impression that you did not know who this man was. [Madam Suzie] It's not what you think, officer. Before yesterday, I'd never seen him but when he came here to drink. When he finished his drink, he left. [Stanley] I do not understand why we are wasting our time on this guy, when we can question the suya guy and find out where he was last night [Hassan] Inspector Stanley! [slow hip hop music continues] We are not innocent. Neither is she. When a person reduces the lives of our children for profit, and has the audacity to walk around in public as if nothing ever happened, that person is worse than a thief. The system does not punish rich people. And God takes too long. So I'm guilty. And I'm not sorry. [dramatic music playing] Subtitled by: Ayolope Koiki
