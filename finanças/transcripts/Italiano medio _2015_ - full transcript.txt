(narrator) In Italy it's just another ordinary day of illegal developments. The park in Cement Avenue is going to be demolished . Making the way for the Upcoming Beautiful The very last idea of the most famous person in Italy the businessman of beauty, the manufacturer of taste. Giancarlo Billboards! What do you have to say to those who accuse you of demolishing a park to build an elitarian neighbourhood? These people VIOLINS PLAYING Excuse me, it's my live ringtone. I'll switch to vibration. IMITATION OF VIBRATION Darling, these people have no taste. They are so miserable. Do you know what it means to live in the beauty? Beautiful shops! Beautiful buildings! Beautiful doormen! Beautiful parking lots! Beautiful pedestrians! Beautiful ugly women! More questions? (narrator) A handul of dissenters can't stand all this. One of them is Giulio Worm. Why is he holding a pink pigeon? Let's make a movie about him. Everything started from a washing mistake. (Filomena) Oh my God! TV REPORT OF A FOOTBALL MATCH - Antonio, look what happened! - Shut up, I am watching TV. Look. - Is it my t'shirt? - It is. My t-shirt! You poor stupid rotten miserable! It's not my fault, I washed it with lemon soap. Don't you know that lemons are astringent? What the hell were you thinking! What are we going to do with this t-shirt? Let's make a bay to fill it up! Nine months after, the t-shirt is filled up. Giulio Worm. You made him too small, the t-shirt is too large. You're so stupid! FILOMENA CRIES Together with the baby they also got commercial TV. Filomena, the colour! Come here, have a look! - How nice! - It's not anymore black and white! From that moment Giulio's parents won't turn it off anymore. - Mum, dad! I shit in my head. - Shut up! This lack of attentions makes little Giulio suffer such that he develops a sense of repulsion towards TV. He rejects TV addiction and develops an alarming critical thinking. Daddy, why do you throw away fruit in the same bin as the glass? Why do you throw away paper in the same bin as aluminium? - Why do you eat animals? - GOOD LORD! Year after year, little Giulio take the side of the weak ones pushed by the ambitious goal of saving the world. GOOD LORD! I want to be a football player. I want to be a bimbo. I want to be the winner of the Big Brother but I don't know what it is. (teacher) What about you, Worm? What do you want to be as a grown-up? I want to work in the no profit, set up an ecosustainable organization bio-vegan-animalist, zero impact. GOOD LORD! The Worm realize Giulio has a problem and want to find a solution but it's too late. Watch the football match! Daddy, TV is a univocal medium that makes people passive. It lowers the intellectual abilities of our brain. What the hell is he talking about? CRYING Talk the way you TALK! - Would you like brand clothes? - They're too expensive! - Would you like a scooter? - It's polluting. Would you like a hooker? At the end, exhausted by the ignorance of his parents Giulio leaves his home. Mummy, daddy, I am leaving. Wait till the commercials. (Giulio) I won't! I want to change the world! The Worm have never changed anything Only TV channels. CRYING And so Giulio moves to the North. He attends with passion the course in Environmental Sciences. A signature against nuclear power, a signature against airwaves a signature to save the baboons. Baboons! (Franca) Where do I sign? Finally he meets the only person who shares his own ideals. She. No, she! Franca, a student of Architecture. Their union is inevitable. For the periodical realization of the national inventories of the tropic emissions. Five years later our Worm gets his degree with highest honours discussing an innovative dissertation about sul waste recycling. (Giulio)..in the distribution, in the use and consumption of goods (President) Highest honours, enough! I still have 28 minutes. I can't stand it. I will make the difference in this world. Franca, let's go. I will make the difference. (Giulio) The world population since the beginning of the century till today has increased of 400%. Do you know what do we produce most? Do you know? It's waste. Giulio wanted to make the difference. But he starts working in the recycling. This is a dirty job but it takes a great responsibility, a great value. Do you get it? As I alway say one has first to dig into shit in order to find gold. And therefore let's do make it right. Come on, Pippo! Come on, Aldone! (Pippo) Giulio, I have already my own problems. I can't spend my day listening to your preaching. This job is disgusting enough, can't you see! Your problem rise from your indifference. FART Aldone, what are you doing? Farts are one of the main causes of the ozone hole. I never fart. I hold myself, since always! Then make a petition and I will sign it like this. FART (Giulio) What can I do with you guys. It's our job. COMPLAINS Gosh, yesterday they banned Kevin from MasterVip! Didn't you see? (girl) how did it happen? They were in the private room and he ordered some white wine. White wine in the private room? Unbelievable! There is a woman in pain! Didn't you see her? She's laying down. Madam? (Giulio) What are you doing! Is there a doctor? Madam, how are you? One thinks about global emissions famines genocides in Africa Tibet oppression by China, poor people in the nuclear Pakistan to the exploitation of baboons! And those stupid ones, while a woman is about to die they talk of Kevin being banned from MasterVip! What? Kevin has been banned? I can't believe it He was my favourite. PSYCHOLOGIST CRIES You can't understand! I bet 5.000 euro on Kevin's victory and what does he do? He orders white wine. Shit, this is not a wine bar! DISCO MUSIC IN THE CAR CLACSON Hey boy, move on!

VOICES Right now in his head there's a tough fight. (Tough, tough, tough) DISCO MUSIC LATIN AMERICAN MUSIC What happened to him?

As the time went by he developed a dormant bipolarity. Until he met Alfonzo I want to be an usher. ..Something snapped inside of him. He invented that pill to justify that attitude of the average italian that he wanted so much to take on. Done? Who better than a stupid old friend that could give him that pill? On one side an extreme altruist, on the other somebody who doesn't give a damn, a bold man against a hippie DISCO MUSIC LATIN AMERICAN MUSIC Good Lord! Giulio! How are you?

You can still make some profit with the bricks but real money is earned with dreams Do you know what colour is today's dream? - It's green. - What do you mean? Biological, nature, those kind of bullshit, the veganism, the animalism, the ginger, all this is business This area has a great value. - You know which one? - No. Be clear, Worm. It's not green.
