The first fire was at 1.30 o'clock in the last night It was in the litter the fire was starting I come out from my house and I see there is a fire in the litter If they have not take out the bottle of gas maybe the fire is coming inside to this restaurant No change, see over there No change? The judgement decided... They said to the government party Because there was 2 parties: one human rights, one government party They spoke with the government party They not speak with those who support us like our lawyer, the human rights side The judge told to the police : - You can't broke... or finishing any house with people living in them at the moment Because to all the country it's not allowed anybody living in any place they broke or is destroyed Yesterday, me, Almaz, Johnny, Dawitt We go to the train, the boat Inside the truck, me and Almaz and Dawitt They three, me, and Johnny Scan, police, check inside the car Three guys: Outside!

Come and join us on the road... near the bridge and the Salaam Centre Will they destroy everything? No, they won't They’re coming to count us Everybody must come tomorrow You, him, everyone, everyone It was really a strange feeling because everybody were waiting for the judge Because she will judge, it's gonna destroy their lives And they have second problem that night First of all, they’re waiting to cross the border to England And they are waiting for the judge, maybe they will destroy their dreams And they're impatient The wind smells like smoke It's coming this way The loonies are making a barbecue! Someone opened the gas can I left over there I can smell the smoke The smell of smoke had been here a while Lieutenant! Volunteers... But I don’t see any volunteers Because before she never go to Isbergues Because she has not have money Now she happy Me too, I am happy Almaz she go Isbergues She can not get a chance from here to England Because for men no different from here but for women, very different She can't jump over the fence... You see one car, police car? You see... I don’t know by English That, after cut... And if no police arriving We climb inside truck It's really strange Where I am standing now by the sea is the perfect place to cross the border But now, it's very busy It's too hard We don't really know how to do it A lucky one can pull it off Another one can’t It’s cold but the warm weather is coming back The seasons are mixing We can’t change the climate We must deal with it There will be better days ahead There, in the distance, is the port It’s the main gateway to get in We’ll see if I can I’ve been here for three months It’s hard to cross over It’s hard to get into England I don’t know how but I won’t give up England is my only hope My only way out I must be brave I have no choice Uncertainty prevails Anyway... I’ll keep trying I have no choice I have to keep going Everybody tries to cross the same way But it’s not the easiest passage Possibilities arise thanks to dockers But even that is too crowded One could almost say it’s closed It’s hard and it’s still cold Nobody would want to live like this I can’t give up A Christian doesn’t give up But it’s weird I hate everything here I can’t take it anymore We’re prisoners Our families don’t know where we are We don’t know what to do It’s going to be alright We’ve been through so much hardship in Libya Good times will follow bad ones It’s going to be OK We’ll see what the future holds That’s my answer The border is burning Rain... Welcome inside The fire truck The sports car The golf cart The parachute The oil tanker The submarine, the tank The tramway The yacht What TV channel today? Fuck you! In Eritrea, the government is very dictator The army is obligatory If you want to learn you can’t learn there The government teach you for army If you can't accept that the government, they try to kill you Maybe the police catches you they send you somewhere to teach you be a soldier And if you don't want to be taught the army you have to leave Eritrea The police maybe catches up to you Exactly you're dead In army, they change exactly your mind You think like a dictator You change your mind You don't have mercy for another person On YouTube... you see a lot of people like this You wanted to ask him a question? Yes, did it happen to him last winter? You come here, I will talk to you now Maybe that time you come I don't know who you are I didn't talk to you... Yeah, but now, this time, I know who am I And I know you are friends - So he had bouts of dementia, like that? - Yes, he did Because the priest said the Bible words the devil is very angry, understand? The devil... I'm not Look at that cop, staring at us Son of a bitch... What does he think? Where was he born? What are they gonna do? Don’t worry... You’ll get in I just need them to give me the thing But the dude's speaking about a 20 euro phone! For tomorrow? He’s smart, he goes through us to not get beaten up Do you know these guys? I don’t trust them We have no choice, may God hear us We never know whether they’re up to good or bad Do you know what they did to Wodiema? They told him to dress up and they took pictures Do you understand? They asked to take his picture and said nothing bad would happen Hi Almaz... Are you alright? Yes, I’m fine, my Dawitt I’ve missed you, honey Me too, me too... I’m with you, 100 % I’m good, but England’s no good How about you? I’m alright, but I really miss you and Zeid Yes, yes, yes, sorry, sorry You went and left me behind No, no, no, my Dawitt, it was just so difficult to leave We couldn’t wait for you Don’t worry, there is a God How about you, how are you doing? I’m good Everything’s fine, I miss you though... How about you, honey, how are you? We’re doing good but it’s hard Don’t worry, there is a God, sister There is a God, but it’s different here We are really alone It’s our fault, we shouldn’t have left Before leaving, it was 100 euros, then 200, after, 400 and big promises! It’s OK, honey, don’t be afraid Did you call your family for money? No, there’s no money, no money Don’t forget me Don’t forget me How could I forget you? I’ll send you your SIM card No, you don’t have to Are you sure? Of course, you’ve done enough I wonder what’s in store for us Thank you so much, my Dawitt Honestly, I don’t know There’s no more hope here, nothing Nothing? No, nothing We can’t do anything for you from where we are But we won’t let you down But where can I go? Just wait, you’ll catch your break, Dawitt Hold on, just be patient He says there are no possibilities for the moment I’m so sorry, my Dawitt
