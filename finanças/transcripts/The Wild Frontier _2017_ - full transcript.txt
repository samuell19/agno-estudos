The judgement decided... They said to the government party Because there was 2 parties: one human rights, one government party They spoke with the government party They not speak with those who support us like our lawyer, the human rights side The judge told to the police : - You can't broke... or finishing any house with people living in them at the moment Because to all the country it's not allowed anybody living in any place they broke or is destroyed Yesterday, me, Almaz, Johnny, Dawitt We go to the train, the boat Inside the truck, me and Almaz and Dawitt They three, me, and Johnny Scan, police, check inside the car Three guys: Outside!

Come and join us on the road... near the bridge and the Salaam Centre Will they destroy everything? No, they won't Theyâ€™re coming to count us Everybody must come tomorrow You, him, everyone, everyone It was really a strange feeling because everybody were waiting for the judge Because she will judge, it's gonna destroy their lives And they have second problem that night First of all, theyâ€™re waiting to cross the border to England And they are waiting for the judge, maybe they will destroy their dreams And they're impatient The wind smells like smoke It's coming this way The loonies are making a barbecue! Someone opened the gas can I left over there I can smell the smoke The smell of smoke had been here a while Lieutenant! Volunteers... But I donâ€™t see any volunteers Because before she never go to Isbergues Because she has not have money Now she happy Me too, I am happy Almaz she go Isbergues She can not get a chance from here to England Because for men no different from here but for women, very different She can't jump over the fence... You see one car, police car? You see... I donâ€™t know by English That, after cut... And if no police arriving We climb inside truck It's really strange Where I am standing now by the sea is the perfect place to cross the border But now, it's very busy It's too hard We don't really know how to do it A lucky one can pull it off Another one canâ€™t Itâ€™s cold but the warm weather is coming back The seasons are mixing We canâ€™t change the climate We must deal with it There will be better days ahead There, in the distance, is the port Itâ€™s the main gateway to get in Weâ€™ll see if I can Iâ€™ve been here for three months Itâ€™s hard to cross over Itâ€™s hard to get into England I donâ€™t know how but I wonâ€™t give up England is my only hope My only way out I must be brave I have no choice Uncertainty prevails Anyway... Iâ€™ll keep trying I have no choice I have to keep going Everybody tries to cross the same way But itâ€™s not the easiest passage Possibilities arise thanks to dockers But even that is too crowded One could almost say itâ€™s closed Itâ€™s hard and itâ€™s still cold Nobody would want to live like this I canâ€™t give up A Christian doesnâ€™t give up But itâ€™s weird I hate everything here I canâ€™t take it anymore Weâ€™re prisoners Our families donâ€™t know where we are We donâ€™t know what to do Itâ€™s going to be alright Weâ€™ve been through so much hardship in Libya Good times will follow bad ones Itâ€™s going to be OK Weâ€™ll see what the future holds Thatâ€™s my answer The border is burning Rain... Welcome inside The fire truck The sports car The golf cart The parachute The oil tanker The submarine, the tank The tramway The yacht What TV channel today? Fuck you! In Eritrea, the government is very dictator The army is obligatory If you want to learn you canâ€™t learn there The government teach you for army If you can't accept that the government, they try to kill you Maybe the police catches you they send you somewhere to teach you be a soldier And if you don't want to be taught the army you have to leave Eritrea The police maybe catches up to you Exactly you're dead In army, they change exactly your mind You think like a dictator You change your mind You don't have mercy for another person On YouTube... you see a lot of people like this You wanted to ask him a question? Yes, did it happen to him last winter? You come here, I will talk to you now Maybe that time you come I don't know who you are I didn't talk to you... Yeah, but now, this time, I know who am I And I know you are friends - So he had bouts of dementia, like that? - Yes, he did Because the priest said the Bible words the devil is very angry, understand? The devil... I'm not Look at that cop, staring at us Son of a bitch... What does he think? Where was he born? What are they gonna do? Donâ€™t worry... Youâ€™ll get in I just need them to give me the thing But the dude's speaking about a 20 euro phone! For tomorrow? Heâ€™s smart, he goes through us to not get beaten up Do you know these guys? I donâ€™t trust them We have no choice, may God hear us We never know whether theyâ€™re up to good or bad Do you know what they did to Wodiema? They told him to dress up and they took pictures Do you understand? They asked to take his picture and said nothing bad would happen Hi Almaz... Are you alright? Yes, Iâ€™m fine, my Dawitt Iâ€™ve missed you, honey Me too, me too... Iâ€™m with you, 100 % Iâ€™m good, but Englandâ€™s no good How about you? Iâ€™m alright, but I really miss you and Zeid Yes, yes, yes, sorry, sorry You went and left me behind No, no, no, my Dawitt, it was just so difficult to leave We couldnâ€™t wait for you Donâ€™t worry, there is a God How about you, how are you doing? Iâ€™m good Everythingâ€™s fine, I miss you though... How about you, honey, how are you? Weâ€™re doing good but itâ€™s hard Donâ€™t worry, there is a God, sister There is a God, but itâ€™s different here We are really alone Itâ€™s our fault, we shouldnâ€™t have left Before leaving, it was 100 euros, then 200, after, 400 and big promises! Itâ€™s OK, honey, donâ€™t be afraid Did you call your family for money? No, thereâ€™s no money, no money Donâ€™t forget me Donâ€™t forget me How could I forget you? Iâ€™ll send you your SIM card No, you donâ€™t have to Are you sure? Of course, youâ€™ve done enough I wonder whatâ€™s in store for us Thank you so much, my Dawitt Honestly, I donâ€™t know Thereâ€™s no more hope here, nothing Nothing? No, nothing We canâ€™t do anything for you from where we are But we wonâ€™t let you down But where can I go? Just wait, youâ€™ll catch your break, Dawitt Hold on, just be patient He says there are no possibilities for the moment Iâ€™m so sorry, my Dawitt
