YES, FLOODS, DROUGHTS, EARTHQUAKES, HURRICANES, TORNADOES-- ALL GETTING MORE SEVERE, MORE UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY I INVENTED P.A.T.T.I. EARLY PREDICTIONS MEANS EARLY WARNINGS.

TRAVELS NORTH FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO, RIGHT AROUND BROWNSVILLE HERE. A STRAIGHT, UNOBSTRUCTED PATH TO THE PLAINS, RIGHT? AND WHEN THESE TWO ELEMENTS MEET...

WE'LL HAVE TEXAS PREDICTIONS FOR TEXAS WEATHER. WHAT ABOUT CHASERS? THEY'LL BE CHASING THEIR OWN TAILS. TOTALLY OBSOLETE. THAT'S NOT REALLY THE CASE. TAKE THE TWISTER IN ADRIAN. DOPPLER DETECTED THE STORM COMING, HAD THE HOUR ON THE NOSE. THEY CALLED IT FOR 3:30 P.M. EXACTLY. THAT'S INCREDIBLE. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, THEY HAD IT THREE COUNTIES AWAY IN PARMER, SO THE WARNING BOX WAS OFF BY 75 MILES. AS I WAS ABOUT TO SAY, WE'LL ALWAYS RELY ON SPOTTERS AND CHASERS. WE'LL BE ABLE TO PINPOINT THE STORM FORMATIONS MUCH MORE EXACTLY. AND GET DATA UP TO YOU... SO YOU CAN GIVE BETTER, EARLIER WARNINGS TO YOUR VIEWERS. THAT'S THE THEORY, ANYWAY.

AND YOU DON'T OUTGUESS IT WITH PREDICTIONS. YES, BUT, UM, DOPPLER RADAR PINPOINTS THE ELEMENTS OF A STORM... BEFORE THE TORNADO-- YOU CAN'T GUESS WEATHER SITTING AT A COMPUTER SCREEN. DOPPLER IS ONLY ONE OF OUR TOOLS. WE HAVE COMPUTER SIMULATIONS ON THE VERGE... OF ACCURATELY PREDICTING THE PATH OF A MESOCYCLONE-- HEY, WITH ALL OF YOUR FANCY MACHINES-- I MEAN ALL OF THEM-- YOU KNOW YOU STILL CAN'T TELL ME... WHEN A TORNADO'S GOING TO COME...

THAT AND MY SENSES, 'CAUSE SOONER OR LATER, YOU GOT TO GET OUTSIDE AND SMELL THE WEATHER.

NOT SINCE 10:00. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. YOU KNOW, JUST TO BE SAFE, WE BETTER GET THEM TO ISSUE A RISK FOR SEVERE... FROM MILBURN TO DALHART. THANKS. SOMEHOW, I STILL CAN'T SEE YOU ON THE FARM. OH, I DID MY TIME AWAY AT COLLEGE. MISSOURI'S GOT A KILLER METEOROLOGY DEPARTMENT. THEN WHY DID YOU COME BACK? MY GRANDMA DIED. AND YOU FIGURED EFREM NEEDED LOOKING AFTER? IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE. IT'S NOT LIKE HE WAS GOING TO THROW HIMSELF OFF THE SILO OR ANYTHING. SINCE GRANDMA DIED, HE ONLY SEES THE DARK SIDE OF NATURE, SO I FIGURED HE COULD USE SOMEBODY AROUND... TO HELP SEE LIFE AGAIN. AND YOU'RE STAYING BECAUSE... SAM, I'M NOT A FOOL. I KNOW IN A CERTAIN SENSE, WE'RE ALL JUST-- I DON'T KNOW-- ROAD KILL HERE ON TORNADO ALLEY, BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN... A CERTAIN WONDER TO IT ALL. A CERTAIN MYSTERY. HOW CAN THE SAME TORNADO SMASH A FREIGHT TRAIN TO SPLINTERS... AND ALSO PICK UP A CARTON OF EGGS... AND SET IT DOWN THREE COUNTIES AWAY... WITHOUT BREAKING A SINGLE EGG? FOR TWO PEOPLE WHO AREN'T SUPPOSED TO LIKE EACH OTHER, WE SURE DO TALK A LOT. [BEEPER BEEPING] O.K., MARGIE. THANKS. YOU GOT THE WORD TO THEM AT THE FARM? I OWE YOU. WE GOT ONE, SAM. HAVE A SAFE TRIP, HUH? I'M NOT FLYING IF I COULD BE CHASING A TORNADO. [HORN HONKING] COME ON, OLIVER. GET UP FRONT. IT'S NOT SAFE TO RIDE BACK THERE. GET UP IN THERE, OLLIE. SLIDE IN, GRANDPA. I'M SLIDING. I'M IN. LET'S GO. [TEX] STAY WITH ME NOW. WE GOT IN LINE, JAKE. TEX, IF WE GET ON 385 NORTH TO 54 EAST, WE'LL KEEP ON IT. EFREM'S WATCHING FOR SOUTH WINDS. THERE'S NO WAY IT'S GOING TO TACK UP TO 54. WE GOT TO STAY ON IT. WE AIN'T NEVER GOING TO CATCH IT. JUST STAY STRAIGHT TO 385. IT'S GOING TO BE A RIGHT TURN, AND WE'LL CIRCLE IT. WE'LL GO AROUND. WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME. [TEX] COPY THAT, JAKE. [SAM] IF THE DRIVING'S THIS BAD, HOW MUCH WORSE COULD THE ACTUAL TORNADO BE? DID YOU GET AN UPDATE FROM S.P.C.? DID THEY GET A WATCH OUT? THIS CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. THEY'VE ISSUED A RISK FOR A SEVERE, BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT. OVER THERE. IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG ONE, EH, GRANDPA? YOU'D BETTER BELIEVE IT. [JAKE] TEX, LET'S HIT IT. HOLD ONTO YOUR HATS. [CELL PHONE RINGS] YEAH. HOLD ON, MARGIE. TEX, I GOT MARGIE ON NOW. LET ME GET BACK TO YOU. YES, MA'AM. JAKE, YOU ON THIS CRITTER? IT SNUCK UP ON US. WE HAD IT TARGETED WEST. YEAH, I'M ON IT. WE'RE 5 MILES SOUTH OF MILBURN OFF 385 NORTH. THE CORE IS 2 MILES NORTH OF HERE, ABOUT 30 MILES AN HOUR. O.K, I'M GETTING THAT DOWN. WE NEED TO ISSUE A WARNING STAT. GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT. WHERE'S IT GOING? IT'S GOING TO BE A RIGHT TURNER, EAST. O.K., EAST. MARGIE, BUT IT'S UNSTABLE. YOU'VE GOT TO GET CONFIRMATION FROM NORTH OF MILBURN, ASAP, O.K.? WILL DO. GOOD HUNTING, JAKE. ALL RIGHT, HANG ON, 'CAUSE HERE WE GO. [WIND HOWLING] WOW. IT'S REALLY PICKING UP OUT THERE. YEAH. IF THE TORNADO HITS US, THE TRUCK WILL PROTECT US, RIGHT? IF WE SEE IT, WE BAIL AND HEAD FOR A DRAINAGE DITCH. IF WE DON'T SEE IT COMING? GET RELIGION IN A HURRY. AAH! THANK GOD FOR SAFETY GLASS, HUH? I'M HOPING TO THANK HIM FOR BETTER THAN THAT. TEX, I'M HEADING UP TOWARDS ROSEVILLE. COPY. LEAVE YOUR DOORS OPEN. MY GOD, LOOK AT THAT. HOW WOULD YOU CALL IT, JAKE-- F-3, 4? THAT ONE IS AT LEAST A 4, MAYBE EVEN A 5. [TEX] GIVE ME THAT CAMERA, OLLIE. SORRY, DR. B. THIS ONE WAS TOO FAST FOR US. [BRANSON] INCREDIBLE. YOU CALLED IT DEAD-ON, JAKE. THAT'S A RIGHT-TURNER. [SAM] JAKE, IT'S TURNING BACK. OH, NO, NO, NO, NO. IT'S HEADED STRAIGHT FOR ROSEVILLE. MARGIE, THIS IS JAKE. I NEED A BLAST, PRONTO. PUT THE BIKE DOWN. LET'S GO. MARTY, LOOK AT THIS. IT'S REALLY BLOWING. JEEZ. THEY HAVEN'T ISSUED A WARNING. [WARNING SIREN] [MAN] HELP! [WOMAN] SOMEBODY, PLEASE. [MAN] YEAH. THERE'S TWO OF THEM OVER THERE. [WOMAN] I CAN'T FIND MY BABY. [MAN] CLARICE, WHERE ARE YOU? [MAN] I FOUND HER! [WOMAN] I FOUND HER OUT BACK. [WOMAN] RIGHT HERE. OHH! IT'S GONE! TINA! TINA, OVER HERE! THIS IS JAKE THORNE REQUESTING EMERGENCY MEDICAL ASSISTANCE. WE NEED MEDICAL EVAC AND PERSONNEL HERE ASAP. WESTBURY HOSPITAL SHOULD BE PUT ON ALERT FOR INCOMING CASUALTIES... AND FOR THE HELICOPTER TO DELHART GENERAL. COPY? COPY. [MAN] WE GOT TO GET MORE HELP IN HERE! [WOMAN] SOMEBODY, PLEASE HELP US! [MAN] ANYBODY GOT A CELL PHONE THAT WORKS? JUST TRY NOT TO MOVE YOUR ARM, O.K.? SEE IF YOU CAN FIND SOME BANDAGES, SHEETS, ANYTHING. TAKE IT EASY. [WOMAN] I DON'T THINK THEY'RE WORKING. [MAN] HEY, MEL, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? WHERE'S MY WIFE? HAVE YOU SEEN MY WIFE? COME ON. WALK OVER HERE. LET'S GET SOME WATER. HEY, EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. HEY, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU. NO, NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU. [SIRENS APPROACHING] [HELICOPTER HOVERING] EXCUSE US. COMING THROUGH. AND YOU WERE IN YOUR KITCHEN WHEN THE TWISTER STRUCK? WE WERE GOING UP EARLY 'CAUSE I-- I DON'T REMEMBER WHY. NORMALLY, I WORK ON THURSDAYS. WHEN THE TORNADO HIT, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED? WHERE'S MY WIFE? WHERE IS SHE? RICHARD COCHRAN, KLCA-TV. O.K., O.K., JUST HOLD TILL THE NEXT LIVE FEED. RICHIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE WITH THAT CAMERA? DON'T PREACH AT ME, JAKE. THAT MAN'S WIFE COULD BE DEAD. THIS IS MY JOB. I GET AN ASSIGNMENT, I DO IT. RIGHT OR WRONG, IT DOESN'T MATTER. THIS IS NEWS. THIS IS WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS. YOU'RE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO OBLIGE, AREN'T YOU? YOU CAN ROT IN THIS JERKWATER TOWN FOR ALL I CARE, BUT I'M GOING PLACES. FOR YOUR INFORMATION, THE NETWORK CALLED FOR A SATELLITE PICKUP. IF YOU TORNADO CHASERS DID YOUR JOB A LITTLE BIT BETTER, I WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS AT ALL. YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED ONE LITTLE BIT SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. YOU GOT ALL THAT RIGHT. I'M STILL A FINISHER, AND YOU ARE STILL A LOSER. BETTER FIX YOUR HAIR FOR THE CAMERAS, RICHIE. YOU'RE A LITTLE MESSED UP. YOU'RE NOT GOING ON THE FIELD TRIALS, ARE YOU? I DON'T KNOW. WELL, I KNOW YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY TO THE AIRPORT. PLEASE, THERE'S NO TIME FOR BUREAUCRATIC DOUBLE-TALK. I NEED MORE TIME. I'M JUST THE MESSENGER. THE MESSAGE WAS WRITTEN LONG BEFORE I SET FOOT IN TEXAS. WELL, I WAS HOPING AGAINST HOPE. ALL RIGHT, I SHOULD'VE GUESSED THAT. FOR A SCIENTIST, I CAN BE EXTREMELY NAIVE. I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. I KNOW. JUST RELAX. RELAX. [CHILD] MAMA! MOMMY! YOU SEE IT ON TV, BUT...YOU DON'T SEE IT AT ALL. ONCE YOU SEE IT FIRSTHAND, YOU NEVER SEE IT IN ANY OTHER WAY. HOW OLD WERE YOU THE FIRST TIME? I WAS PLAYING IN THE PARLOR WITH MY SIS... WHEN I HEARD THE ROAR. BEING A BOY, I HAD TO GET ME A CLOSER LOOK. I'M OUT IN THE BACKYARD. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, I CAN'T MOVE A MUSCLE, 'CAUSE THERE, RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES, I SEE A FUNNEL FORMING, AND THEN A SECOND ONE AND THEN ANOTHER ONE, LIKE SOME THREE-HEADED MONSTER. MY MOTHER'S CALLING ME, AND I'M CALLING HER, AND ALL YOU CAN HEAR IS THAT ROAR. I WATCHED MY MOTHER GET PULLED UP INTO THAT FUNNEL. THAT WAS THE LAST I EVER SAW OF HER. I WAS 5 YEARS OLD WHEN THAT MONSTER CAME AND ATE MY WORLD, AND NOW IT'S COMING AGAIN. [MEN CHATTERING] I OVERSLEPT. THAT ROOSTER'S FALLING DOWN ON THE JOB. JAKE. IF THOSE PEOPLE HAD ANY WARNING AT ALL, EVEN 10 MINUTES. THEY HAD A SIREN. I SAW IT. YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF. I CALLED IT WRONG, SAM. I CALLED IT EAST. HOW COULD YOU KNOW IT WAS GOING TO TURN? ALL EVERYBODY'S BEEN TELLING ME SINCE I GOT HERE... IS HOW UNPREDICTABLE THEY ARE. YOU'RE NOT GOD. YOU DID YOUR BEST. WHAT GOOD IS ALL THIS MACHINERY AND MANPOWER IF WE KEEP GETTING TRICKED? - WHY EVEN BOTHER? - DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT? I'M GOING TO GET A CALL FROM MY OFFICE... WONDERING WHY I'M NOT SITTING AT MY DESK FILING A TERMINATION REPORT. WHAT SHOULD I TELL THEM, JAKE, HUH? [KNOCK ON DOOR] IF IT'S A BAD TIME-- NO, NO. COME ON IN. ACTUALLY, JAKE, I WAS HOPING... MAYBE YOU AND ME COULD TAKE A WALK. YEAH, SURE. I'LL TALK WITH SAM. BIG DAY YESTERDAY. I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, JAKE. I CAN'T CHASE. I DIDN'T KNOW-- I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE. I MEAN, REALLY, IN REAL LIFE. I SAW THOSE PEOPLE, AND SUDDENLY IT SEEMED... LIKE I'VE BEEN CHASING MY OWN TAIL, GOING IN CIRCLES. I ASKED MATTIE TO MARRY ME. HEY, HEY, TEX, THAT'S GREAT! WELL, THEN IT'S JUST AS WELL. A CHASER'S NO WORK FOR A FAMILY MAN, ANYWAY. ALL RIGHT. HE CAME OUT OF THE BLUE. HE SHOWED UP AT MY HOUSE AND WOKE US UP... AND ASKED ME TO SET THE DATE. AND HE WANTED TO DO IT TOMORROW. I NEED MORE TIME. I GOT TO GET A DRESS. WE DECIDED WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN TWO WEEKS. OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL. CONGRATULATIONS. I'D LIKE IT IF YOU COULD BE HERE FOR THE WEDDING. CAN YOU COME? OH, THAT'S VERY KIND, MATTIE, BUT I MIGHT HAVE TO GO BACK TO WASHINGTON ON SHORT NOTICE. I KNOW. [ HORN HONKING] I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU WERE WANTED. - [HONKING] - HEY, THERE SHE IS. I JUST HEARD. CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. BYE-BYE. BYE-BYE. LOVE BLOOMS IN THE PANHANDLE. TEX IS QUITTING. I GUESSED AS MUCH. WHAT ABOUT YOU? ARE YOU QUITTING TOO? [PHONE RINGS] [RINGING CONTINUES] JAKE, THERE'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW. THE ANTI-ENVIRONMENTAL LOBBY WANTS TO PULL THE PLUG ON ANY PROJECT... THAT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES GLOBAL WARMING. [RINGING CONTINUES] SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, WE WERE FINISHED BEFORE WE EVER STARTED? I'M SAYING THIS COULD COST ME MY JOB. I NEED TO KNOW NOW. ARE YOU GOING TO QUIT TOO? I TOLD DR. BRANSON I WAS GOING TO HELP HIM OUT, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. WHAT ABOUT YOU, SAM? YOU GOING TO ANSWER THAT CALL? [RINGING] IMAGINING WHAT THE ALOE'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE? OH, COULD BE. YOU'RE NO MORE A FARMER THAN YOU ARE A CHASER. THAT'S EFREM'S LIFE. HE TOOK ME IN, SAM. I OWE HIM. DON'T WAIT TOO LONG, JAKE. YOU MIGHT END UP BEING THE PERSON YOU NEVER WANTED TO BE. YOU MEAN LIKE THE TERMINATOR? [THUNDER] YEAH. HERE. LET'S GO ON UP. - [THUNDERCLAP] - [GASPS] [THUNDER RUMBLING] EVENING. OH, I WAS JUST GOING TO GET A DRINK OF WATER. EXCUSE ME. UH, COULD YOU USE SOMETHING JUST A TAD STRONGER? YOU HAVE NO IDEA. COME ON IN, SIT YOURSELF DOWN. NIGHTMARE. YEAH. YEAH. YOU WON'T TELL JAKE ABOUT THIS, WILL YOU? YOU KNOW, HE'S A LITTLE OLD LADY ABOUT MY DRINKING, AND MY DOCTOR AIN'T MUCH BETTER. I PROMISE. YEAH. I USED TO HAVE THEM ALL THE TIME, REAL FIRE AND BRIMSTONE BEAUTIES. I'VE NEVER SEEN A DEAD BODY BEFORE. HERE'S HOPING YOU NEVER SEE ONE AGAIN. MMM... HEY, YOU PLAY CHECKERS? OF COURSE YOU DO. LET'S FINISH THE GAME THAT JACOB AND ME STARTED. IT'LL RELAX YOU. YOUR MOVE. MM-HMM. DO YOU THINK P.A.T.T.I.'S GOING TO WORK? I'VE NEVER KNOWN A MACHINE... THAT CAN BEAT A TORNADO. NUTS AND BOLTS AND COMPUTER CHIPS, ALL THAT MANMADE STUFF. I WISH DOC WELL. I SINCERELY DO. BUT I JUST DON'T THINK THAT MACHINE OF HIS WILL DO IT. THE ONLY THING THAT'LL BEAT A TORNADO IS FLESH AND BLOOD. THE OFFICE CALLED TODAY. THEY WANT ME TO KILL THE PROGRAM. - AND? - I DIDN'T TAKE THE CALL. [CHUCKLES] WELL, I TELL YOU. YOU HAVE A GREAT HEART, SUGAR, BUT YOU ARE A LOUSY CHECKER PLAYER. [CHUCKLING] YOU KNOW, DOC THINKS ONE OF THE WEATHER PIECES IS MISSING, BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS ALL THERE... JUST HIDING IN PLAIN VIEW. IT'S A QUESTION OF WHAT YOU MAKE OF THEM. ANOTHER ONE? NO. THANK YOU. I THINK I'M READY TO GO BACK TO SLEEP. NOW, NOT SO FAST, SLICK. FIRST, KING ME. [CHUCKLES] GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. KING ME, YOU ROTTEN SON OF A BITCH. THIS TIME I'M GOING TO BE READY FOR YOU. ♪ [RADIO: COUNTRY MUSIC] JUST ON THE EAR, RIGHT? YEAH. CAN'T DO IT THERE. HOW ABOUT THEM RANGERS? SO, I SOLD ALL MY IBM STOCK. THERE'S NO WAY I'M GETTING INTO ON-LINE SERVICES. [EMERGENCY BROADCAST WARNING BLARES] WE INTERRUPT OUR REGULAR PROGRAMMING... TO INFORM YOU THAT THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE... HAS ISSUED A TORNADO WATCH FOR THESE COUNTIES-- UNTIL THEY UPGRADE THEIR WARNING, I DON'T STOP CUTTING. [PHONE RINGS] HELLO? YEAH, MARGIE. WHAT DO WE HAVE? WHERE? ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. GEORGE, STOP CUTTING. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [YELPS] [THUNDER] WE GOT BIG TROUBLE, JAKEY. RUDY CAN SMELL IT. HEY, ZEENA, EASY, EASY, EASY. O.K., NOW, WHAT DOES YOUR BAROMETER SAY? UH-HUH. ALL RIGHT, THANKS. KEEP US POSTED. I DON'T GET IT. WE GOT THESE SATELLITE IMAGES... STRAIGHT FROM FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE THIS MORNING, YET SOMEONE REPOSITIONED THIS FLAG... IN THE EXACT SAME PLACE LAST NIGHT. YOU SEE THIS LINE? THIS IS THE SECOND WAVE OF A JET STREAM... WHICH HAS BEEN BUILDING STEADILY, ALMOST LIKE A PHANTOM, GETTING STRONGER. ALL OF WHICH MEANS WE COULD HAVE A TORNADO. ALL OF WHICH MEANS THAT LAST TORNADO WAS THE FIRST TASTE... OF THIS MASSIVE WEATHER SYSTEM. [SCREEN DOOR OPENS] WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHICH FORTUNETELLER FLAGGED IT? I DID, AND IT'S GOING TO BE A KILLER, THE LIKES OF WHICH WE AIN'T SEEN IN MANY A DAY. AIN'T THAT RIGHT, DOC? ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10, IF THE LAST WAS A 5, THIS WOULD BE... 15. [THUNDERCLAP] IF WE CAN'T GET A COMMITMENT FROM S.P.C., WE BOX IT OURSELVES. TAKE A LOOK. OH, MY. LORD HAVE MERCY. I DON'T SEE WHY WE GOT TO GO TO AMARILLO. TEX FULTON, THERE'S NO DAMN WAY I'M GETTING MY WEDDING RING... AT THE BYRON JEWELRY BARN. WELL, DOESN'T THAT DALHART MALL... HAVE A FIVE AND DIME? OH! I'M WARNING YOU, BOY. YOU KNOW, I GOT THIS SUDDEN URGE TO SEE MOM AND DAD. MONKEY TOO. DO YOU MIND? AS LONG AS IT'S FOR YOU, I DON'T MIND A THING. LISTEN, RICHIE, I KNOW YOU AND I HAVEN'T BEEN COMPADRES, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO COME THROUGH ON THIS ONE. THE S.P.C. SAYS THE STORM IS SOUTH OF AMARILLO, HEADING EAST, BUT IF YOU LOOK, THE NORTH END IS LEADING THE LINE. THESE STORMS WON'T PASS ANYWHERE NEAR BYRON. THEY'RE BLOWING SOUTH OF AMARILLO IN MY VIEWING AREA. WHEN DID YOU BECOME AN EXPERT? I NEED YOU TO UPGRADE TO A WARNING. DON'T TELL ME MY BUSINESS. NOW, S.P.C. HAS ONLY RED-BOXED IT FROM... FROM AMARILLO TO MIDLAND. UNTIL I GET MORE FROM WEATHER SERVICE, I CAN'T UPGRADE ON MY OWN. I'M TELLING YOU, THE STORM IS HEADING NORTH. THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. I'M NOT GONNA PUT MY CAREER ON THE LINE BECAUSE YOU GOT SOME FEELING. WOULDN'T I LOOK THE FOOL WITH A FALSE WARNING? JAKE, I'VE GOT TEX FROM THE ROAD. PUT HIM ON SPEAKER. DON'T DISAPPEAR, RICHIE. JAKE? JAKE, YOU THERE? COME IN, JAKE. CAN YOU READ ME? TEX, WHAT'S GOING ON? MATTIE AND I ARE JUST NORTH OF AMARILLO ON 87. THERE'S A STORM OUT HERE. A PRETTY BIG ONE. ANY REPORTS-- TEX, YOU'RE BREAKING UP. [STATIC] YEAH. IT CAME UP SUDDENLY. THIS COULD BE WORSE THAN THE LAST ONE. TEX? [STATIC] YOU HEAR THAT, MR. WEATHERMAN? TEX ALWAYS LANDS ON HIS FEET. IF ONE PERSON GETS INJURED BECAUSE OF YOUR INCOMPETENCE, I'LL LAND ON YOU LIKE A TON OF BRICKS. IT'S ALMOST ON US. GET THAT BELT OFF. GET OUT OF THE TRUCK. FIND A DITCH. HOLD ON, MATTIE! MATTIE! AN ENORMOUS MESOCYCLONE HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED. WE HAVE REPORTS OF A FEW TWISTERS, MOST LIKELY F-5s. 300 MILES AN HOUR, EASY. SO, WHEN DO WE START CHASING? SAM... WE DON'T HAVE TO CHASE ANYTHING. THE STORM IS HEADED STRAIGHT FOR US. I, UH, NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING. YOU'RE WONDERING ABOUT THE NETWORK REACTION... TO YOUR SATELLITE FEED. DID THEY LIKE IT? LIKE IT? THEY WENT NUTS. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO HANG ON TO YOU HERE. I AM GOING TO FRAME THIS. LISTEN, WE MIGHT HAVE A BIG TORNADO ON THE WAY. I'D LIKE TO GO ON AIR WITH A WARNING. DID WE GET SOMETHING FROM N.W.S.? NOTHING OFFICIAL. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT'LL BLOW OVER. YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. I'M JUST WOUND A LITTLE TIGHT, IS ALL. I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. OF COURSE, I WANTED REVEREND SWANBECK, BUT MATTIE THINKS HE'S TOO BORING, SO SHE'S TALKING TO THAT REVEREND MADDEN FELLOW... OVER IN DALHART. I NEED AN EMERGENCY CUT-IN, NOW. LET'S PLACE IT RIGHT HERE. O.K. MONKEY, COME ON! HURRY! THERE WAS A BULLETIN ON TV. A TWISTER'S COMING! I'M WORRIED ABOUT MATTIE! THE WIND IS OUT OF THE SOUTH-SOUTHEAST. GOOD. THIS IS THE BEST PLACE. ONCE I SET THE FIRING MECHANISM, THERE'S A 10-SECOND DELAY. [BEEPING] O.K., STAND BACK. NO! ONE OF THE PINS DIDN'T FIRE! UNLESS ALL FOUR ARE PLANTED, IT WON'T HOLD. WHAT CAN WE DO? I'VE GOT TO CHECK THE FIRING MECHANISM. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME! I NEED A DRIVING PIN AND THE TOOLBOX. I GOT THEM! WE'VE GOT TO GET MOVING! NOW! HEY! NOW! LET'S GO! COME ON! DR. B! HEY! WHAT? I CAN'T! I HAVE TO FIX THE LEG! [SIREN SOUNDS] AN OCTOPUS? NO. IT'S A BAT, SEE? BATS SHOULD BE UPSIDE DOWN. I'LL STAND ON MY HEAD. [THUMPING] ALL RIGHT, HONEY. WHAT'S THIS? I DON'T KNOW. WELL, COME ON. TRY. DAVID, I DON'T KNOW. [SCREAMING] [BEEPING] I'LL HAVE TO SHUT IT MANUALLY. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME. YOU CAN DO IT! GET INSIDE! NOW! GRANDPA! EFREM! COME ON, GRANDPA! FORGET IT! NO! I NEED ANOTHER MINUTE! COME ON! NO! NO! I'VE GOT TO GET IT! GRANDPA, PLEASE, COME ON! LEAVE ME BE! COME ON! WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT! UNH! JAKE! SAM! HANG ON! AAH! [WIND SUBSIDES] WE'RE INSIDE. WE'RE INSIDE IT? IT'S ALL AROUND US. OH, MY GOD. YOU O.K.? I'M ALL RIGHT. GET TO THE STORM SHELTER... BEFORE THE OTHER SIDE REACHES US. COME ON! HURRY, JAKE! WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME! IT'S NOT GOING TO HOLD! COME ON! GET INSIDE! COME ON, GRANDPA! PLEASE, EVERYBODY GET DOWN! COME ON! [GLASS BREAKS] I'VE GOT TO SET THE LEG! GRANDPA! EFREM! NO! EFREM! YEAH. O.K., EVERYBODY. LET'S GET THE POSTMORTEMS. [RING] N.W.S. OLDHAM COUNTY REPORTING? [PHONE RINGS] N.W.S. PARMER COUNTY? GO AHEAD. WHAT'S THE STORY? [BARKING] [BARKING] WHAT DO YOU THINK, BOY? MAYBE WE'LL START A FRANCHISE. WHY HAVEN'T WE HEARD FROM THEM? I'M SURE THEY'RE FINE. WE DID ALL RIGHT. NO REAL DAMAGE. OH, HEAVENS. MATTIE! HEY, MAMA! I'LL TELL YOU, TEX WILL DO ANYTHING... TO AVOID GETTING MARRIED. HEY, MONKEY. OHH! YOU O.K., SIS? IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN A LITTLE BUMP ON THE HEAD... TO MAKE ME MISS OUR WEDDING DAY. AND THOU WILL DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER. AMEN. HEY. IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO I-- YOU CAME THROUGH JUST FINE, RICHIE. I'M JUST FOLLOWING YOUR LEAD. I THINK HE WENT THE WAY HE WANTED TO. OR MAYBE THE ONLY WAY HE COULD. I BET HE LOOKED RIGHT INTO THE DEAD SOUL OF THAT MONSTER... AND RIPPED OUT HIS DEVIL HEART FOR GOOD. P.A.T.T.I. NEVER COULD HAVE SURVIVED THAT STORM WITHOUT YOU. THE MEASUREMENTS SHE TOOK THAT NIGHT... WILL ALLOW US TO SAVE MANY LIVES. THAT IS YOUR LEGACY. JAKE... I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME, BUT I HAVE A DEPARTMENTAL FELLOWSHIP... THAT'S YOURS FOR THE ASKING. DO THINK ABOUT IT, WON'T YOU? I'LL DO THAT, DOC. THAT'LL BE THE DAY, WHEN JAKE THORNE GOES BACK TO SCHOOL. ONCE A CHASER, ALWAYS A CHASER? ONCE A TERMINATOR, ALWAYS A TERMINATOR? I CAN'T SEE GOING BACK TO IT. TRUTH IS, I CAN'T SEE PAST TEX AND MATTIE'S WEDDING. YOU KNOW, I'LL NEED A DATE. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING CHASED FOR A CHANGE? I COULD GET TO LIKE THAT JUST FINE.
