Hello and welcome to the doc exchange a real stories podcast in partnership with the Grierson Trust. Every week I'll ask a new filmmaker or filmmaking team about three documentaries connected by a single theme that have made a meaningful impression on their work and life. [Music] I'm Olly Alexander. I'm lead singer of the band "Years and years" and an out gay man. [Music] I've also recently come out about my struggles with my mental health. I have anxiety and depression and I'm not alone. There's a perception that in 2017 for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people it's all good. We have equal marriage, we're protected in rights but the stats tell us that 40% of lgbt people are likely to suffer with mental health issues like anxiety and depression compared to 25% of the general population. That's outrageous! And I feel like it's something we are just ignoring. It's something that I come across all the time from fans of "Years and years" in letters or when I talk to them at the shows. It's something I know about my own personal experience but also my friends who are in the community. I personally have yet to meet an lgbt person that hasn't been unscathed by growing up lgbt. I mean, I haven't. [Music] I want to understand why and what impact growing up gay has had on me. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] - Three, four... ♪♪♪ What I say about dreams ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ that my father's believe ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Aberrations can steal your child away ♪♪♪ I'm making this film while writing and rehearsing the difficult second album No one can say i don't like a challenge. ♪♪♪ And you're reaching for your brother's arms ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Your two-toned flash of the alarm ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ And I choke, it's too close...♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ And I'm standing on that higher stair ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ I think I'll run away from here ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ So, I'll go ♪♪♪ [Music] I've lived with anxiety and depression since my teenage years. I guess I'm lucky because I recognized the problem and got help, but I do still have regular lapses. As a band we're pretty good at talking about our feelings. Hmm, we've gotten better at it as well and it's...it's kind of a crazy environment to be in. I take my medication, I see a therapist once a week and yeah I have highs and lows. Hmmm... and I get freaked out a lot but it's not as much as I used to and I'm much better at managing stuff, you know. It helps that my band mates Mikey and Emery are hugely supportive when I do have an anxiety attack or when I can't get out of bed. - When you go on stage, you're on stage and there's nothing you can do to get out of that situation. - It's more acute for him because he's... - He's right in the center front - Yeah, and singing I think is a very personal thing to do - We can hide a bit behind, yeah, our scenes... - But, yeah, there's been a few times when I had to prop him up when he didn't want to go on stage or didn't want to go back on for the encore. He just wasn't feeling very confident. - When we're on tour I just have to get into this quite like like a robot athlete, like I'm just... you know, like focused. I go to bed early, I like, I have to be good to myself like and and I have to perform on stage and almost like not think too much about everything that's going on because I've had times when I've hmm... you know, come like just... come off stage like and had like a panic attack and I'm like sobbing and I have to go back on stage and it's like, you know, just like you like... take the microphone... you like... your face... smiling and you say this is a nightmare...hmm...hmm.. Then that's like not a good place to be in I've probably been aware of my depression and anxiety for about 12 years, but I often wonder where it came from and what caused it. I've always kept diaries so they feel like a good place to begin. What I started to notice when I was reading back these diaries is how really early on I started to feel really distressed and i don't tell anyone about it, I don't think. So, I'm 14, turning 15 I think my parents have just split up and I'm starting to really have like long periods of feeling low and feeling people don't understand me and like feeling kind of just unhappy and confused by it. 2nd of october 2005 The other night was the worst it's ever been and I need to remember this. I remember dancing. That was awesome feeling consumed by such incredible energy but I was so hot so i took my shirt off, just my small black t-shirt left. Dancing and then Matt came up to me and saw my plaster on my arm and then came the words I've been waiting for ever since I began " You haven't been cutting yourself, have you? Oh boy..." I just wanted to do it because I... I felt like it was... I had all these feelings... I couldn't... ...deal with so, you know, harming myself was like... seemed the most obvious way to deal with it. It it felt like simple and... you know it felt good to do it and then it felt awful and then it was just this cycle. And then a year later I kind of stopped of doing that and I developed an eating disorder, basically throwing up food and just costantly, constantly thinking about what I'm eating like I was just writing pages of "I will not eat bread, I will not eat cakes I will not eat chocolate I will not eat bread, I will not eat cakes I will not eat chocolate It's a really hard thing to talk about Hmm... that's why I'm trying to talk about it. Hmm... we want to tell people that we're proud and we're happy and that... Look, being gay didn't make me sad, it didn't make me... hasn't made things harder for me it's made things better, it's made things great Look how...you know? And it can be hard too, then go. Actually I think maybe growing up gay and in a straight world hummm... has really affected me and has made me feel all these things and I think that can be a really hard thing for people to actually say. You know I'm not saying that being gay means you're going to be sad or you're going to be depressed, I'm not saying that, but there's a link and I think I want to understand it better. Reading back my diaries, it's shocking to see how low I was at that time. I'm in a better place now, but I'm pretty sure that for me a big part of my struggles with mental health are down to those years of coming to terms with my sexuality. During that time I was living at home with my mum. Going home can be a difficult experience. I feel like I was a different person when I was a teenager growing up. On the way here, like "why don't I feel sick?" and it feels a bit like facing up to some painful memories. You know, I left school and then moved to London and I have a different life now and it's like... now I'm realizing that part of me has sort of tried to like squash down a lot of that and be like well I'm this different person now, you know. [Music] Sleepy Colford is a far cry from my hectic life in London [Music] It's where my lovely mom Vicky still lives - Hello How are you doing? - Good. How are you? - You look lovely - Well, you look even lovelier - This is my old room. I moved here with my mum and brother a few years after my parents split up and my dad moved away. This is it! This is my room from about 16. I feel a bit like... it's like living in a cupboard under the stairs. I think 16 year old me was very... very emotional and I felt a bit like lonely because I didn't really tell, I wasn't really telling anybody about it. I also felt really like I was maybe a freak, like I was really different because people were just telling me that I was different all the time, really. Part of me really liked being weird, liked being different and I thought that was, that was who I was, but then another part of me thought it was just wished... I wished I was like everyone else, I wished I was normal. Normal... Oh my god I can't even say that... No... I don't wish I was normal... yeah! I hate that word! I don't think my mum really knew what was going on for me about then. So I've decided it's time we talked about it. Failed... - I've got something to show you - What is it? I haven't seen mum for a few months, she's been going through all our old home videos. Terrifying! Is that me? - Yes The next step like... [Music] Well, this is the last Christmas of this 20th year century and I'm so excited - Oh my god, I feel sick... I was bullied from when I was 9 until I was about 15, but I didn't really tell anyone. I don't know if you knew but when in primary school I started getting bullied Well, I looked like a girl, you're like a girl... - Really? - Yeah, that cause I had long hair and then that became that I was gay. - Oh... - And then in secondary school, yeah, I started to like think that I was gay and then that became. I just wished I was just like " I don't want to be gay" like I ... I already felt like people picked on me and then I was like "this is going to be even worse" and then I think, I don't know, it seems like I was just like... putting jazz hands over everything! - I think about when you asked me if I did know that you were gay - Yeah - I said you know I had a feeling that you might be but maybe I didn't want to... hmm... affirm that because of fear of what your life might become like from all the homophobia that still exists out there. So... the bullying? - When I was like 14, 15 it kind of stopped - And then you started becoming anorexic, bulimic? - Bulimic really, in a having restricting food as well and I would self-harm - I remember thinking why is this happening? I don't think we really had a full conversation about, sweetie. Yeah... You're okay? I guess, I think I might have been in denial maybe or... - I felt so bad because I couldn't explain to you what was going on then I felt ashamed to myself for like being... the way I was and I couldn't tell you and like... - Could anything have been different if if you'd been able to talk to me? - I can't help but feel guilty as a parent... What could I have?... Oh... - You couldn't have done nothing, believe me. I couldn't talk about it. - Why? - I wasn't...come to terms within myself, at all with anything You're a great mom, you're great mom. [Music] - I feel like I'm starting to sort of blame myself a little bit less. I can see why maybe I did struggle the way I did because I could feel like I couldn't talk to anyone and I was ashamed of myself and part of that was because I was ashamed of being gay and no wonder really that then caused me to get so low and, you know, feel the way I did about things The shame I felt from such a young age must have had a major impact on my mental health. School was a horrible time for me and bulimia and self-harm were my ways of coping. I felt I couldn't talk to anybody, not even my best friend Georgina - Hi George Sometimes I think the closer someone is to, the harder it is to share With Georgina we were so close, we spent every day together. You know, there did come a time when we were aware that the other was going through some stuff, but we just... we didn't know how to have a conversation about it. - Do you remember when we first laid eyes on each other? - Yeah! I just remember you having curtains and a choke and following, literally following me around like this! Like you're like stalking me everywhere - Oh my god yeah! - Yeah! I was obsessed with you from the first moment. George was someone who helped me to survive my traumatic school years - Oh my god it's like it's not even here anymore. This is so weird. It's...it's all gone. - Yeah. - I find it quite hard to actually remember stuff - Yeah - Getting bullied but it wasn't really ever like that bad physically, but it just was being made to make me feel like that I was different, like I didn't fit in and stuff. - Yeah, there was a general kind of vocabulary around you been used. That wasn't, that wasn't positive I guess. - Yeah! Did you think I was gay? Always think I was gay? - Yeah, but then you started seeing girls and... I don't know. I guess, yeah, I was confused, looking... - Yeah - Like from a friend point of view Yeah, always knowing but then never, maybe never having the courage to bring it up with you or something even though we were really close, but I... - But then... how would you have... - Yeah... - You like babe... - Yeah - Do you know you're gay? - I think you're gay I think at school I learned that people around me were my enemies. You know like other kids were going to be mean to me I was always on guard, on the defensive all the time. It just creates this like... Even talking about now I'm like... I'm getting anxiety about it and it's yeah... I never liked spending time with kids my own age because I thought they'd, they'd be mean to me and that yeah, I guess I learned that at school, that I didn't fit in with them so I should...I would have to go and find somewhere else to fit in. Looking back, I think that rejection had a huge impact on my mental health. George wants to take me back to one of her old haunts. We danced together a lot in our teens and we can't help but repeat old habits whenever we get together and I do not need any excuse to dance. I got a mirror in front of me and I'm just like "Sorry, I'm too busy looking at myself now" And turn we can make our own dance routines? - Yeah - Cool, cool - Shift - Loop - Loop - Scoot - Scoot [Music] It feels just like old times, but a lot has happened to both of us Whilst we've both grown up queer, George has only recently had the courage to come out and she's had her own issues to deal with. I started having kind of breakdowns - Yeah - Like at the end of primary school. I would just crying and I didn't know why and...then I kind of continued throughout... hmm...secondary school as well. They were like moments of...hmm... just real distress. Hmm, I started developing symptoms of an eating disorder when I was 11 or 12. I knew you had a difficult relationship with eating and then, I think, I then told you that I thought I was bulimic. I remember that conversation because of me kind of being confused about these feelings that I was having and trying to suppress them because I wasn't... I didn't know what to do with them or where to place them in terms of trying to dull it down and not act on it or not ignoring how to act on it anyway. - It was really good to hear that stuff and part of me is like "Why didn't we tell each other at the time", but... Well I wish...the first time I was questioning my sexuality, it had felt safe to to say "Oh, I don't know what my sexuality is, maybe I'm gay" I wish that had been something I could have done you know because it wasn't and so... that's your first introduction to your sexuality is that it's wrong and that you have to hide it. You cannot underestimate shame. The moment it kind of creeps into your life from a really young age, felt by lgbt people. The moment that you realize you're different to everybody else that just plants the seed of toxic pain and it just grows and grows and grows and then it just gets larger and larger as you grow older and I think that has a huge impact. I left school 10 years ago now and I doubt the effects will ever leave me. I'd hoped things had changed, but a brand new study by Stonewall shows that half of all lgbt teens are bullied at school. Today I'm meeting a young guy called Connor, just turned 15 hmm...He's gay and he was bullied out of his school. - Hello - Hello - Come in - Thanks - Hi Connor - Hi Ollie - How are you doing? - Good, thanks - How is at school? - Usual... just boring... fair enough! - Well, school's definitely not changed that much then. - When did you come out at school ? - 13 - Right. I feel like it's a really brave thing to come out as young, young as you did Hmm... How bad did the bullying get? - At one point a group of girls had spread a rumor that I said I'd done stuff with an older boy and the boy found me the next day, grabbed me by the throat at the top of a set of stairs and pushed me down them. - Wow - Mum phoned the school, had a go at them and I think the next day or something she had a meeting with a head mistress and told her I'm leaving... Hmm... she's taking me out of school and she ain't bringing me back. You feel like you're alone, you have no one to go to. You feel insecure about yourself You feel like there is completely nothing you can do to change, yeah. And people do targeting you for no apparent reason apart from you being you. It's just heartbreaking! At one point I was self-harming quite badly and I do still have scars from it. I was quite suicidal. I admit I did try to attempt it because I didn't think I deserved to be here anymore if I felt like I was to disgrace and I couldn't turn to anyone. - Did you talk to your mum? - No, I didn't talk to anyone. I pushed everyone that I was close to away from me. I think it's really... hmmm... it's so hard to talk about, you know, thoughts of suicide - Yeah - Because I think it really scares people, it's a scary thing - Yeah - And it really scares people and obviously it's... it's so good to talk about it - Yes, yeah! It is, yeah. Is it! It relieves people from stress and thinking they're like alone and feeling that way and you can help other people get out of that state - Yeah - You know what it's like being in there yourself [Music] - Connor isn't alone. Stonewall study shows that two in three lgbt teens will have self-harmed and one in four, including 45% of trans people, will have attempts to take their own life. It's so awful to think that these young people can't imagine their bright future whilst in the midst of being bullied. I want to find out how Connor's mom Helen coped with her son being in crisis. - He was very depressed, very suicidal hmm...self-harming...hmm... - How did you know that, that was going on? - He didn't tell me. He's just got very withdrawn and I didn't trust him being on his own. I knew something won't right Hmm... and I used to make him get in bed with me just so i knew where he was and that he was safe so i could get to sleep and You feel that you failed as parent, you really really do. - I just want to say... No, no, don't apologize it's... Hmm... I want to just tell you that I have had conversation with my mom really similar to this and she said like really similar things because she felt like she didn't know what was going on with me when I was at...hmm...school and it was really hard for her I think as well. - Yeah, let me hug I'm sorry, sorry - Sorry Sorry - Cut that...don't... - I'm sorry - Please, don't apologize... - No, you do. You feel like you've failed as parent because your job as a parent is to protect your child and you can't protect them from everything because you're not there 24 7. - Of course you can't, of course you can't. - How people can not speak to their children just because they have come out as transgender, bisexual, lesbian, gay... so bloody what... They're your child... yes... you... oh sorry - Sorry When she was talking about Connor having thoughts of suicide I can't imagine, you know, someone, you know, saying that to my mum even though you know like... that I did have some really dark thoughts at that time and you don't know don't know how to deal with it. With his mom's support Connor is doing so much better. She's found him a local lgbt youth group called Blah where he gets to hang out with young people like him. - Hi guys - Hi - This is Ollie - Hello - I think just goes to show like Connor was going through all this stuff and then it took him talking to his mum and leaving a school but then finding a youth group for him, to then start feeling more on top of things Having youth groups and having places where young queer people can meet each other and share stories and like find support with each other it's just so good, it's been so good for Connor. If I had the lgbt youth group, that would have been amazing! [Music] For many of us our introduction to other lgbt people is through going out on the gay scene which is exactly what I did when I was 19. I moved to East London and I started going out a lot and it was kind of this awakening in some ways because I was meeting all these people that I was so in awe of. They just seemed so self-possessed and colorful and vibrant and they were always at these clubs every weekend and I would go every weekend and I'd get to know everybody and I started going out I think too much like Thursday to Sunday, to Monday every week And now when I think back about it I think for it to be really focused around partying, drugs and sex. It can really...I dont'know... is slip into a really damaging cycle and it can, I think really... if you're already a vulnerable person it can really just trap you and it's hard to find a way out. [Music] I am meeting a guy called Sean. Hmm...He is 25, he's from London. and...and... He is going through struggles with drug use Sean is fresh out of an intensive drugs program and I'm nervous to meet him as this issue feels close to home for me and many of my gay male friends - Hello, you're finally get to me! - Nice to meet you I'm keen to break the ice with Sean and dancing is always a good way to do it. Yeah... Oh no... Oh wait which leg is that? Right - Yeah All right. - You already did it! - You did it! That...that... [Music] I want to ask Sean what he thinks may have led to his addiction - When did you come out? - I came out officially when I was 17. - Okay - Hmm... I got forced out really. My mum asked me one day "Are you gay ?" and it took me a good 30 minutes before answering because it was kind of a big decision for me so I told her the truth and it had a backlash - Fuck! She told me to go to my dad's. - So she basically chucked you out? - Yeah, it was very hard I took it very... like rejection hmm... from my own mother. It wasn't eventually until my mum said "I'm not upset that you're gay, I still love you, you're my son. hmm... I'm more scared that if there is a hell, and the bible says you're going to hell, you will be there and if I do go to heaven I will be there, how would I live in peace in heaven? It was hard to be by myself I had to learn everything about myself...hmm...yeah - It feels like... yeah... like loneliness and like isolation It's something that like a lot of queer people experience - Exactly... school was... horrible you tell someone "a faggot" that straight away is like using the N-word, if i'm allowed to say that. It's... it's rude. That created a lot of friction and... a lot of fights broke out, a lot of arguments. That's the blessing in the isolation, I guess. I, I can only say from my experience, it pushed me into dark places. The whole culture of cruising, it felt so... because it was secretive and I was secretive. It went hand in hand, no one asked my name and then they didn't have to. I got what I wanted, they got what they wanted in a simple way. - What do you think you were looking for... like when you went... when you went cruising? - Acceptance. Someone to love me... hmm... I didn't get much anywhere else. Then, as soon as I hit 18, I started sex clubs and saunas and dark rooms... - Did you feel like i went too far like...on occasions? - Yeah. I slipped into typical gay drugs. I began with MDMA and then...hmm... meeting one person, they helped me into... what the gay community calls "slamming". Slamming is when you inject yourself and I was injecting crystal meth. I would be around people who would give it to me and I would give them my body. Unfortunately, the hard lesson had to come from it... and unfortunately I was... drugged and raped...hmm and through that i got given hepatitis C. Now I'm still on treatment now for it. I fully can't remember the rape. I just remember waking up and calling back home. I'll be honest, after the rape, I didn't stop. I craved more, I craved... I felt dirty so... so I had to be in the dare, heavier... In my head that darkness was my friend. [music] - When rejection comes at you from all these different sides you'll... all you want and you're seeking is connection and intimacy. If you even get a shred of acceptance from... from anybody, from anything like... like maybe Sean got when he first went cruising or he got when he first went to a party, you know like... that is all you have to cling to so, of course, that's just gonna reinforce itself. I know that... When I was first sort of going out in the gay scene in East London, it was just a given that you would do drugs. You know, it went hand in hand with like partying, celebrating and dancing and that kind of... you know, the positive side of gay nightlife but then it's so easily tipped in... tips into really damaging behavior. [Music] The feeling of rejection got worse for Sean when he felt he couldn't be accepted by either parent and was left homeless, sleeping rough in Soho. [music] - I was on the streets for a good two weeks. - How did you survive? - Hmm...do all the bad, rough things that you shouldn't really be doing. It was just a bad moment. Hmm...It was the wrong way to go about things, it was the wrong way to find who I was... hmm.. - I feel like you didn't have a choice, like? Just when you're saying like... "Oh it was the wrong way to do things", I just...I don't know.. - It was the lowest point of my life that I ever got to and I hope I never get back there again. - Yeah - Really, yeah - It's hard to hear you talk about it - Yeah [music] Sean isn't a one-off. Young lgbt people are much more likely to become homeless, making up almost a quarter of young homeless people. For most of them like Sean, their sexual or gender identity was a factor in their rejection from home. Hearing Sean's story has really affected me. I think Sean is just very close to home and, you know, not just my experience but so many people who are close to me and people that, you know, aren't here anymore because or for whatever reason and I just like... I just think it's... oh my god... I'm not gonna cry and what like... Selfie gets in my kitchen... Addiction is a form of self-harm, bulimia is another and it disproportionately affects gay men. These are usually coping mechanisms and there's often a secrecy around them. With my bulimia no one really knew, you just can't tell. Today I'm in Brighton to meet a gay guy called Tom who is still very much in crisis. I'm really looking forward to meeting him, but also quite nervous hmm...I suppose because I've never actually spoken that much about my bulimia and every time I did speak about it I talked about it as it was a longtime ago and I'm quite...apprehensive of...hmm discussing it with somebody who's, who's going through it. Tom is a 21 year old English student at University He's had to defer his final year because of his poor mental health. - When I was about 15 I started turning to food to sort to cope with various things and that's when I started to... start binging and then purging and making myself sick and, sort of on and off, I did that over the last five years. Hmm...sometimes like really intensely, sometimes not so much Hmm... yeah as either a coping mechanism, a way of controlling my body and then in the last few years, it's probably gotten to its most intense point hmm...while I was at university. At his worst last year, Tom was binging and purging up to six times a day putting his body under huge amounts of pressure. - I think it's probably got a lot to do with coming into my own, in terms of my sexuality starting to like, try and dip my toe into like dating guys and actually...sex and I think that's when the pressures of looking a certain way, acting a certain way have really sort of got to me and then alongside just finding university difficult. - Is there a specific thing that makes you feel like that you think "okay now I... this is making me feel really bad"? - Yeah, I've got myself into a pattern now where I weigh myself constantly throughout the day hmm... and so that's become a very big sort of fixture, trying to keep that at a certain level so that I'm always comfortable with where that is Hmm... and so if if that for any reason has like gone up or down a bit then that will often sort of trigger certain behaviors - How do you feel about stopping? -The idea of stopping... Yeah it's an impossibility I have no idea how I would go about stopping I can't really picture a life where I don't do it because I don't know what I'd do instead. It's such a difficult I mean, I found it so difficult to even want to stop and I can see that's something that he's grappling with now, something about sharing, sharing that. It feels really good, it feels good actually Speaking to people who you share and experience with can be so powerful. Tom and I have arranged to attend an eating disorder group together. I'm still dealing with my issues around eating and feel nervous about opening up. Yeah we're going to the UK's only, men only eating disorder group and sitting on their session hmm...so that's going to be really interesting. [Music] - Hi - Hi guys The session is being run by dr Will Devlin from "Men get eating disorders too". - Well, welcome, lovely to have you here. - Tom and I are joining members, Lawrence and Michael. - I was diagnosed with bulimia last year, but...hmm...I started... hmm... sort of showing the symptoms I was 15, 16. Hmm...I'm 21 now and I'm still struggling with it quite a lot. It seems I'm still in the throes of it. - I don't feel like. Bulimia isn't really a part of my life anymore but I still have this difficult relationship with food. I feel like... it's like your brain gets rewired at some point along the way It sees food or it thinks about food in a certain way and then once it's wired like that it's so hard to just... getting do it, you kwow. - You haven't seem to say that you have it all made at 13, 14, 15 as well. Is there like a reason for the fact that does relate to...hmm.. how we connect with people at that formative age and if we don't, then what do you use? Do you go into drugs or do you go into alcohol abuse or do you go into eating disorders? - I just so wanting people to take notice in a way. If I just said "I'm sad" people be like "okay sure", but if I'm like "No, I'm actually sad and ill", then they might take a bit more seriously. - I ended up going to hospital and, you know, I had a bit of irregular heartbeat and the doctor was like "Are you throwing up?" You know, I kind of...was... I kind of admitted that I was always doing it and she was like... Well, I think this is because of that I felt so ashamed that, you know... this was what's happened and I'd drawn so much attention to myself and, you know, I felt like it was really serious hmm...but I still carried on really. It took me another like four or five years to sort of stop. - Tom, I wonder what it's like to hear the other guys because, in some ways, you're at quite a different place in the journey. - Knowing that there are people who...are better it's a nice reassurance, but it's still such an unreal concept. It's certainly not making me think "Ah, I'm still in the middle of it. How shit for me!" It's just such a fun concept I'm still not sure how I'm processing it. - Just to hear from other people is so much more important than anyone ever gives it credit for and there's something so important about knowing that you're not the only one...- Yeah -...battling something - I can't tell you how brave I think Tom is I can't imagine what it must be like to still be in the middle of that and be talking about it. I think it's an incredible thing that he's doing. [music] Tom's just done something I never did open up about his eating disorder while still going through it. Hopefully it will help him recover and overcome the stigma. I've decided to take this idea of talking about things to a whole new level. So I'm in London, in East London and tonight we are putting on a mental health themed night at the "Glory". hmm... which is a local gay bar and we're gonna have performances and yeah, I think it's gonna be really, really fun. I'm really excited. I'm putting on the night with East End's drag royalty Johnny Woo - Hi Johnny - Hello, how are you? - Oh my god, this is amazing - I know, this is my honesty box - Look at that - Do you like it? - Beautiful, did you do yourself? - Yeah, I'm just gonna set up here now. I made this honesty box to allow people to post their true fears and anxieties. It's clear none of us are talking enough about mental health and I want this event to encourage people to share. Some will do this through performances and I hope for others my box will be a start. I think as queer people, with once we come out and, I think it's there's this pressure to sort of... hmm...behave that everything's fine and you... you're happy and proud and it doesn't matter who you are. There's really a stigma around mental health. It's hard for everybody and I think there's a kind of... a... it's quite a specific issue in... in the queer community that I think is...is... It's makes it a hard thing to address. Owning up to there being a problem is a good step forward. - Tah tah!!! The next step throw some glitter at it. - Ladies and gentlemen you're in Johnny Woo's show [Applause] Welcome to the Glory's big gay mental health night [Applause] We'll be investigating and and getting to the bottom of gay mental health. - Now to enlist some confessions and darkest fears - You can come and write in my mental health box - I wouldn't'mind. I mean, I've got a story to tell, so... - Put it in - If you like thoughts and feelings, like secrets, like the confessions ...Like having some paper and stuff over there. I'm supposed to stay clear of weird company... - People with mental health problems they they just need a little bit of respect [music] and one of them was from my dad - Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much [Applause and music] - Oh my gosh... hmm... I don't know what to say It was amazing It was so good I asked people to put their confessions in my honesty box. Okay, this one says it was freaking scary but then one day my teacher pulled me aside after school and told me about their gay friend. It was the first time I'd heard that you could be gay and happy. My depression lifted and I came out soon after. It's nice! This one says: I hate my body, I do not like what I see in the mirror and I feel I will never find a partner until I'll look better. I fit the gay stereotype and it makes really sad and hopeless sometimes. The hate of homosexuality that the world instilled in me as I was growing up stays with me It is a battle that I attempt to overcome every day. [Music and applause] It's quite shocking to read these because you're like... I was there tonight like everyone's having a good time and it's like... you can't have a good time but you know people are actually feeling these things and... and... you know this is like, you know that's like honest. Nothing is gonna happen unless we talk about this, like it's just not like we can't pretend like... things are gonna get better if we don't fucking talk about it Hmm, sorry...hmm... like it's just not [Applause and music] [Music] Everyone I've spoken to was either bullied at school for being lgbt or it was made clear that it was shameful. Imagine the benefits to them if that had been directly challenged. Today I'm at a school in Wood Green in London and...hmm I've been asked by a organization called "Diversity role models" to take part of a workshop. Hmm... that's all about lgbt issues and... and my good friend Paris Lees is thankfully doing it with me. -Hi - What are you doing at the bike shed? - Oh you know me, just hanging around. How are you? I'm so nervous - Me too. It's exciting as well though. - Right, yeah, it'll be good. It does look like a nice school actually - Yeah - Gemma Curtis has been mentoring us in how to be good lgbt role models and she'll be holding our hands throughout. - How are you by feeling about telling your stories? - Well... - Good! - Yeah. I'm excited but I'm really worried I'm going to cry - Oh no, don't. - Nooo.... - How many times have you done this do you think? - Oh well, I'm school with them...hundreds - Really? I'm not gonna lie both Paris and I are petrified. This is the first time I've been inside a school, I think, since I left and i try like to not think about like young me very much because it makes me sad and then when you're around just like loads of young people reminds me of when I was young. - Hmm... Ollie is going to introduce a bit of a game - Anagram game, so it's gonna be some words on this side I jumbled them up and I want you to rearrange them into words they actually are meant to be. - Lesbian - Right, lesbian Gay...bisexual...transgender - Very good. That was very quick, yeah. - I'm very impressed. - Okay, what do we think might be the key issues that somebody who identifies as lgbt it would be dealing with if they were in school with you, guys? Yeah! Bullying - What kind of bullying might that be? - They would mad at to be friend of you - So, rejection. - Yes - They'll feel bad about themselves like being gay or lesbian - Low self-esteem - Low self-esteem yeah. - Yeah - Yes... - I think because like sometimes people aren't comfortable coming out to their parents and they...their parents might judge them, they think other people might be worse and like... act differently towards them. - Excellent. - I don't think this board is big enough actually. - Let's give Ollie a big round of applause - Thank you. Uh! Yes. So my name is Ollie. Hello, it's very nice to meet all of you I was gonna tell you a little bit about my story, my time at school. You know, people would start say to me that hmm... the things that I did were gay or the clothes I wore were gay and they meant it in a negative way and they told me to stop being gay, stop behaving gay, that I was a puff or a fag You know, they made fun of me or they pushed me around in the playground and I was really terrified that I might actually be gay like maybe they were right like the things they were saying to me might be true but I didn't want to admit it like because I thought being gay was a bad thing I felt ashamed. I think the words we use are so important, we can't forget that! - I really hope you've got some questions and you're going to write them down on a post-it note. - Now it's time to see if we got them thinking. - Oh, good question [music] - Did you ever use word gay in a negative way yourself to fit in? Ollie. - Hmm...I think I probably did, you know. Yeah, the... the pressure to fit in is really big, isn't it? - Did you get help from your school or parents? - No and it's a really good question, More kids are being supported in schools now and I think that's a really good thing. With the support of their school and their family, they are much more likely to be happy, healthy and not have problems. - How can I help my friend with coming out? - Supporting your friends or a friend who wants to come out is all about just...,you know, being respectful of that, of how they feel and if you do see abuse or your friends suffering you're ready to step in and help in some way even if it's just being there for them. [applause] - I wish I went to this school - I wish I'd gone to this school too. We've done research which shows that two years, three years down the line they still remember the facts and the stories of the role model when they came in. - Yeah - so your stories kind of... will seep in and they will remember stories - Yeah, they do - Yeah, I mean I just keep thinking if this had happened in my school it would just... it blows my mind that it can happen in this environment. It works too. On average in all the schools diversity role models have worked in over the last two years Over 40% of students said they use homophobic or transphobic language before the session and only 15% would after. It's great what they're doing, but but why should a charity be doing this? Shouldn't schools be addressing this anyway as part of the curriculum? - Without shadow of a doubt it would have made such difference if i had had lgbt inclusive sex relationship education. It would have helped me in so many ways and it would have helped other queer kids but also it would have helped the kids that weren't queer, that were straight like... everybody benefits from this kind of sex relationship education [Music] I'm learning more and more the benefits of how good it feels to talk about stuff and also being honest with yourself about how you're feeling Something I fear Sean hasn't entirely been doing. We were meant to meet up a couple of weeks ago but he had to reschedule because he was having a lot of anxiety and panic attacks and things. So...hmm...I think he's going through a really tough time at the moment. I'm hoping he feels he can talk to me about what's been going on. - How are you doing? - Oh good, good. Hang in there. I am in what we call "in recovery lapsing". Hmm... and I lapsed into doing drugs again Hmm... I came home from work, it was a bad day of work I just really wanted to just do nothing and... I got a text from someone I previously did drugs with because I was so down on myself and on my self-worth before I knew it the voice in my head to wanting to go and do drugs. It made my heart really beat out my chest. I was thinking finally I'm gonna get some, finally I'm gonna get what I want, finally I'm gonna go back to what I felt was normal. - It's clear Sean is still in the midst of some very tough times but he seems so together, putting on a brave face, it's something I do too. - So you know when we met last time... - Yeah and... talking about kind of... glossing over things or making things sound like everything's fine and you were saying stuff to me like - Yeah hmm..." I was drugged and raped and this happened and this happened, but you know, it was a real positive experience and here I am now and like..." It just sounds like it's so hard for you and I felt like you weren't acknowledging that. - Yeah, I don't like the memory of it - Yeah... - But at the same time... hmm...I do think about it, I think about it a lot...hmm... The moments I talk about anything personal hmm...I always put on a smile because i don't like anyone thinking that I'm weak or vulnerable or things that make me look like I'm damaged goods and those moments, especially that moment of me getting raped, it was... I don't know what to say... it was... hmm... a difficult time because I, I still blame myself and I... - Why, why do you blame yourself? - I guess it's that bad habit of beating myself up - Yeah - Trying to see what I did wrong instead of seeking help to try and go. Okay, you went through this, let's move on from that. I really just pushed it down, hence... why I'm always smiling and always giving this... I'm fine persona. - I don't know, it's like some of the stuff that he was saying like hearing it's quite hard because you know, saying like... he still blames himself for being raped like... what the fuck like... you know... it's really...fuck! Just people should love to feel like that Yeah, it's just horrible! It does really hit from start because You know, it's like... I feel like it's just something... that... me and my friends have had experience with. Those friends aren't here anymore because, you know, it's like if one more person, if one more person goes that way it's like...I can't... Like it's not right... guys aren't maybe doing too much drugs and... It's just scary how it can be like one step away from those people being lost to us, you know, like I don't want that to happen to Sean, I really don't. [Music] - We're losing too many gay men to drugs. A recent report by Imperial College claims someone dies every 12 days in London just from the chem sex drug g and drug use generally within the lgbt community is thought to be seven times higher than the general population. I think lots of this is down to self-worth. Following his laps, I'm so pleased that Sean is seeking further help from the drugs program he was on. "Antidote" is the UK's only lgbt-specific drug and alcohol service and is based at London Friend. [Music] - Thank you very much - All right! I'm just very grateful to Sean for, for letting me hear about his story All our stories are connected you know and we can all relate to that and I...I still do it, you know, I still put on... put on a smile because You know, I think being honest with ourselves about the wounds that we've been dealt and the scars that we have is part of the process, you know. [Music] Today my band "Years and years" are headlining the mighty hoops festival in London. - Well, my hoopla is a festival kind of organized by the "Think the pink" crew who are a queer kind of collective. It should be a really queer event, lots of lgbt people. [Music] I don't actually know where I'm going I think I need to get into a car If I look up back at myself 10 years ago the main difference is now I know how to take care of my own mental health, I have the tools available to me so if something comes up I can be like "pow", you know, knock that back! - There's a little gap here - Yeah - Yeah - Right is the back - Are you wearing a jockstrap? - Yes - Yes, do you like it? - Yeah - I had this bright idea of that I would like to be just in my gold underwear covered in gold glitters or all wrapped up or something like. Right now it's been happening, covered in gold glitter - Thank you Margie - Yeah. I'm good, I'm good - Just wearing normal clothes, looking normal - Oh my god [music] I think we have a real opportunity here to help younger generations and the ones that come after them. It's a choice between kids having low self-esteem, damaged feeling, undeserving of love, ashamed versus encouragement and positivity for them to live their authentic selves and be who they are. We have to do everything we can to make sure that happens - What do you do? - And then it becomes unquestioned and normal that we have inclusive lgbt sexual relationship education, it becomes normal that parents know how to talk to their kids about their sexuality and then we can try and stop what... the suffering and pain that's happening [Music] I think it's, it's really hard not to let...how you grew up growing up gay in a straight world affects you. My journey has been really trying to reconcile everything that happened to me growing up and, you know, now I do things I never dreamed I would do I go on stage in, you know, crazy outfits So, I'm really out to everybody and... I get to... spread a message in front of thousands of people. The queer community inspires me every day. We're a very, very diverse community but I think one thing that we can have in common is the love and support for each other. So... and.. hmm... One thing that I've learned recently is like how hard we all find to talk, like really, really to talk. You need to take some time to actually listen to somebody because it can make such a difference. So, this tent loves you like no matter what sexuality, gender, what your body looks like, what you look like, whether you're femme, whether you're math, whether young or old like we look out for each other [Music] You deserve to have a happy life Never think that you shouldn't have love or you shouldn't be entitled to a happy family or or whatever you want you deserve to have them. Young lgbt people are like the strongest, bravest, most inspiring people I know. [Music]
