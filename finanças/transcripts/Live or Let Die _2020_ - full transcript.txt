What are Heroes ? Are they people, that risk their own lives or even sacrifice themselve for others ? Or are they just simple-minded inventions devoted into keeping that one last spark of faith burning? Or are we already Heros in this Godforsaken-time if we are not one of them?

NO... ok... ok... ok... Now... now don't cry... I just basically did, what he wanted me to do. Let's get out of here! That was pretty close, who were these guys? I've no idea Nick... ...but one thing is for certain... let's not cross paths with them again. Killed for a few supplies, this sick Motherfucker... We really should have tried it. They would have cut our throats open By the way, our supplies might last for two days. We'll keep moving till sundown, find a place to rest for the night and tomorrow morning... ...we'll head to the next town to find more supplies. I don't understand it... ...some people are a lot worst then these bastards... they attack, rape and kill just for fun. I'm sick and tired of this fucking world! Do you also think about... ...if it ever be the same again as it was before? Of course... ...but it'll never be the same again. The world has changed and so have the people. Look at us Nick... ...we walk and walk... ...and keep killing those... things... ...and keep walking again, searching for food so we don't starve. Then we'll die one day... ...and turn into one of those bastards. A bright future looks different. Fuck it's a pity about the bitch... pity about the bitch... A damn shame you had to kill her, goddammit. What's up with Tommy? Fuck that motherfucker, I never liked him anyway. Now let's have some drinks boys... What the fuck...? Hey Boss... ...that was awesome, you showed them! Showed them? Awesome? Make yourself useful and FUCK OFF Harry... are you gonna finish that fucking car this year? I have an idea Nick... let's get drunk! What kind of an idea is that? A damn good one! Are you nuts? We've been on the road for days... and you want to get drunk... here? I think we should celebrate! What??? What the hell are you talking about? What could we possibly have to celebrate? YOU... ...and ME... ...and these two bastards over there... ...and a future without a future. You are insane, man. Um.. What I wanted you to ask... We've been on the road for a while now... and I constantly see you reading that book... what it it about? Come on tell me! It was in the morning, last year in fall I was looking for survivors then, I saw this guy lying next to a tree He was pale and close to his end. He gave me a few things, including this Book... I asked what I'm supposed to do with it... He said: Today is your lucky day... these are coordinates. What do you mean coordinates? Coordinates man, ...to the safest place that you can imagine. We spoke for a while... but he was bitten... ...and I knew what I hat to do. Are you fucking kidding me? I'm not bullshitting you... I have no clue if this is true, or if this guy was just crazy But hey, no risk no fun right? And then came your stupid ass and now we're both siting here! Well, then I wasn't wrong with celebrating... Come on, lets keep moving tomorrow. Cheers the Coordinates! Cheers the Coordinates! Fuck! Nothing to eat... AGAIN FUCK - Stop that shit - Come on... give me that... I'm hungry. It's my can now! Whats the matter Princess, your panties slip up your ass this morning? Take your hands off my can! You want something to eat? This is all your fault, asshole... This whole Situtation is your fucking fault. If we wouldn't have killed that bitch, we would have something to eat. But hey, wait... ...if you want the can, come and get it! SHUT THE FUCK UP You're acting like children! Is it true? Is THIS your fucking can? Yes Boss, Yes Boss? So, sit down and eat and choke on it! YOU... ...and YOU... ...two motherfuckers are also to blame that we have nothing to eat... Now you go out there and fetch us something to eat and make sure you're back at sundown Do you understand? Yes... Do you understand? Yes Boss!!! NOW FUCK OFF! Have fun sunshine What? You're thinking about staying here, aren't you? For a few days ...For a few days... No way man! And why not? Why not? Because of the book, Nick! Do we want to go to a place... that we don't even really know exists, just because someone is writing something about a safe zone? Really? Wait What is your fucking problem? First, you tell me all about it and now you don't care? If we don't keep moving we'll eventually die without even trying. We should stay here for the night. Here? No way in hell, think about those bandits, remember what they did, how many they are, we don't even know if there are more of them I'm so sick and tired of this shit, since weeks we walk from place to place. I want to sleep in a real bed with a roof over my head, and not on this crappy ass forest ground. Three months ago in this house, remember? Yeah I remember We spent three weeks in that dirt hole surrounded by these things and had to eat a cat... Yes John we ate a fucking cat and I had to kill that cat, a fucking cat Nick. I don't feel like constantly having these discussions! I'm not going to be trapped in a fucking hut again, been there done that! Not with me! We came here here checked the hut out and so far we haven't been surrounded by these fucking bastards again, we shouldn't challenge our luck! Hey John .. It's enough! What's up now? You know what your fucking problem is, you're a fucking asshole! Fuck off then! Go on get out of here! Goddammit. That's exactly your thing. Thanks, man NICK: Not for this! But the glasses are mine! Is that a shopping center? Looks like it. You know what that means... JACKPOT John!!! We'll see about that. We have to be careful, let's go take a look around. Awesome, the emergency lights are still working. We should stay here today. We definitely should! Ii is safe here. Quiet -you hear that? - Yeah... Come on... Damn, now this asshole is sending us out to get supplies again! Don't stress... ...I'll go in and see what I can find We'll meet at the campsite before sundown, alright? - Ok, but make sure you bring enough supplies, or else that motherfucker is going berserk -Definitely! Shit... Those are the guys from the woods! Fuck... Our Weapons! You're pretty fucked up now assholes... Bandit: ...come out... ...show yourself es!!! AHHHHHH One down... ...and one to go... Johnâ€œ. ...hey... ...hey come on we have to get out of here... Come on, get up! Damn... I'm sorry man... ...i'm sorry... ...i'm dying... i'm sorry... Come on... ...come on, we can make it! Leave me here... -...leave me behind. - Stop talking shit... ...you're not staying here... ...we can make it... You hear me, brother? Damn! They're coming, man... ...they're coming! Man, they're coming... Come on man, get up! Wake up! We have to keep going... ...come on... get up, get up! They're behind us! Get up... Come on... They're coming... We have to go towards the mountains. Get up They're behind us, man! I ask myself every day, if I'm a good Person Can one still be good under these circumstances? Does is it make sense helping someone in this fucked up world? Either way, sooner or later we'll all die, we're all lonely, lonely and alone! After all this shit, I've met so many people, and almost everyone of them are dead! Because of me? Did I handle the situation wrong? Should I have done something differently? Or should I have just been left alone all along? I realize I would have to apologize to a lot of people, but a person that has to apologize to much screwed up a lot. Maybe you should just leave me here, and continue to follow the book alone. At least I'll rot here and won't become one of those lifeless bastards. He's coming, he's coming It's Christmas boys... Looks like it... Just look at her... Very beautiful. Boss... Boss... Yes? Sorry for disturbing you but we have something for you. I hope so, Charly becauseâ€œ. That's the second time you're bothering me. What do you want? Hello... Is it me you're looking for? I can see it in your eyes Whaaaaaat!! Never interrupt me again..

Hi hi hi hi hi I like you, are there more of you? Are you a group of people? Do you have food? Please God, let me go. God? There is no God. Have you seen the world out there? All the misery, destruction, lifeless bastards and chaos. This God had a great plan. Do you know what we're going to do with you now? Do whatever you want, as long as you go to Hell! Kill her! Nick ? How long have I been gone? A few days, but I have to admit John, you're pretty tough, he almost beat you to death! Are you ok? You know how it is being alone? Only to good my friend, now let's eat something. What's up? Thanks a lot brother. For what? We still have hell to go through, we have to cross the mountains and winter is breaking in!
