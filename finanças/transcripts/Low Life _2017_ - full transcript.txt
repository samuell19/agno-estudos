"Can you send a pic?" Exhibit A, exhibit B, exhibit D. The wiener dog. If he is like, oh, "I don't know what you're talking about. "I'm totally not here for the thing "that I'm obviously here for", I'm gonna be like, "Boom!". How come I got a picture of your di-? I got my handy dandy spy glasses, looking like a sexy nerd. Boom, take off the glasses. What's up, baby? How are you doing? Oh, I'm pretty late. I hope this guy is still here. Hang in there, Mr. Predator. I'm coming to get ya. Where the fuck are you? Ladies and gentlemen, I think I see him. Say, hello. Hello, Mr. Pedophile. Hello? I see you. I'm gonna get you. You only have a couple more seconds of thinking you're gonna meet with Julia. Drum roll, please. Let's dominate. Hey, buddy! How you doing, man? Don't you remember me? Come on, I'll give you one guess to guess. It's me. It's me, stop, stop. It's me, Julia. Look, remember you sent me this? Do you recognize the person in this picture? No. Really, because I think that looks a lot like you, like, you just sent a photo of yourself to a 13-year-old girl. Yeah, it's not. What are you here for? - What am I here for? What are you here for? I don't, I dunno, man. A dead ringer. That's you. Sit inside. You want me to sit inside your car?

I get it. You must be pretty bummed that Julia doesn't actually even exist. Who? - Who? - Yeah. Are you gonna play dumb with me? I'll enlighten you. You know what? I'll enlighten you. I'm talking about Julia. The girl you've been talking to for the past two months, every single day. The 13-year-old girl, you were coming here to have sex with. That Julia. Does that ring a bell? You know the glasses on my head have a camera, right? Yeah. Right there on the bridge. Yeah, I can see it, yeah. Oh, okay, yeah, you can see it? It's okay, you probably have like a brain tumor or something that makes you wanna have sex with little kids, right? It like rubs up against a certain part of your brain and it makes you attracted to young kids. Is that what's wrong with you? No. No, that's not? No. So are you just here to like what, teach little girls a lesson about talking to older men online? No. Well then talk to me. There's some pretty sick stuff in here. You want me to read it? You talk about licking cum off the floor and I mean, it's stuff you wrote, so. Do you think I'm stupid? Do I know you're from somewhere? No, definitely not. We do not run in the same crowds. Is your name Benny Jansen? Yeah, we went to high school together. You're the basketball guy, right? - No. - Yeah. - No. - I was a mascot. Let's focus on you. Butt stuff, eating her out, stuff she's never done before. And she's- - Bro, bro. You talk about wanting her to wear a dog mask? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? These are your words. You wrote this. You talk about, hey, hey. - Let me just see it. Let me see it. - You talk about fingers. And licking of the anus, right- Keep your paws to yourself. - Let me just see it. - No! You talk about licking up cum. So much cum. You're, hey, all right, I'm getting outta the car now. Don't fuck with me, man! Don't fuck with me! Take a long, hard look. This is what a pedophile looks like. Yo! What the fuck! Don't do that! No, no, no! What the fuck! Yo! Dang, boy. What the hell are you doing? Don't fuck with me! Fuck! Oh, fuck, if my camera's fucked up, I'm gonna be fucking pissed off. I swear to God! I swear to God, if this shit's fucked... Fuck! Oh fuck, what the fuck! Hey, Tom, right? Hey, man. You're trying to run away from the fact that you were meeting up with a 13 year old girl? Holy shit. The name's Jansen. Benny Jansen. Oh, fuck. Hey, what's up? What do you mean, what's up? You haven't given me updates in days on you know who! Look, I'm kind of in the middle of something right now. I can't really talk. Also, I'm sorry, since when is it my responsibility to give you play by plays? I showed you this guy. Yeah, no, I... I know, I just. I just usually work alone, is all. Okay, but he's my best friend's dad and I might be sleeping over at his time tonight. Yeah. I know, I know. That's why I'm like, trying to protect you or whatever. Oh my God, so I was right? He's like a total fucking creep? Yeah, no he's a bad, bad dude. He's one of the most aggressive I've ever dealt with. Motherfucker, I fucking knew it! He's always been so fucking creepy towards me. Let's fucking get him tonight, get him tonight. Uh. All right, just calm down for a second, okay? How the fuck can you say that? How can I be calm? Um, look, I'm gonna have to call you back, all right. Wait, wait, wait, Benny, Benny, no. All right, bye. - Benny, Benny, Jansen. - Yeah, what's up? Who's asking? - Hannah Morgan, here. What do you have to say about the Sheriff's press release calling on you to stop making your videos? What? Sheriff Margaret Harvey released a press statement condemning your vigilante behavior. Do you have any comment about that? Wow, what's pretty big time, isn't it? Excuse me? No, I've not heard about this, but I'll give it the old Google search when I go home, all right? I think what everybody wants to know, why do you do this? Why do I do what? Why do I expose predators? - Yes. Why do you wanna hide them? I'm not hiding anything, are you? Whoa, Hannah, I didn't realize you were gonna be so feisty in real life. I love it. Did you know that some of the cases you're involved in can't be properly prosecuted because your chat logs don't meet evidence guidelines? You admit some of them can be properly prosecuted, right? Don't you believe that the police and the DAs know what's best? I think the police don't know what side they're playing for, okay. Do you always feel above the law? All right, I'm late. I gotta go on a run, all right. This has been real fun, but I gotta go. Too fucking good! Get the ball, come on, set the screen. Easy. Banks open, motherfucker. Yeah, do it again, do it again. Watch the guy in front! Play ball, play ball, play ball. Oh! - Oh! - Oh! Do that shit, run that shit. Ew!

This is my fucking court! Benny mother fucking Jansen. Benny mother fucking Jansen, bitch! Fuck! Yo, fuck you! Hey, what's up? You don't know what I'm talking about? No, you got no idea? No, yeah, I'm talking to you. Oh, so tell me, you're just here to admire the scenery then? Yeah, the beautiful fucking scenery. Is that it? Why are you looking at me like that? Why are you fucking looking at me like that then? Why are you looking at me like that, huh? Come on. Yeah, you fucking pervert. You know that I could beat the fucking shit out of you, if you wanted to, but I'm not gonna. Fucking talk to me, she was 13 years old. What's that you little bitch? Huh, huh! What's this? Oh, bitch, guess what? Whoa! This is my impression of you. Come on. There is some of this stuff. I mean, it's really sick stuff. Is your name Benny Jensen? Is your name Benny Jensen? Hmm. Okay, you're the man. What's up, Mother Dunkers? Welcome back. We are on day eight of chatting with our teacher friend. The online poker mistro predator himself has just messaged me and I can tell he's feeling a little frisky. So you know what time it is, huh? That means, it's time to dominate. Hey, cutie pie. Hey. How was work? Jason is typing. Well, hurry the fuck up, Jason. My students were taking tests all day, so I gambled online for most of it. Okay, this guy does not sound like a very good teacher. And thought of you of, course. Or person. How was school? It's so boring. School sucks. That's funny. I can't believe you're a teacher. I wish you were my student. All right, I know what I'm gonna hit him with. I wish I were your student. Look, she's winking at you, Jason. What ya gonna do, bro? What ya gonna do? She's winking right at you. Oh, he responded, okay. Maybe we could have some fun tonight. Okay, here we go, here we go. Um, yeah, wanna meet up by my house? Come on, Jason. I want to do more than meet, L-O-L. Oh, God, more than meet? Maybe you could show me more of you. Un uh, got 'em. You can't ask a seventh grader for nudes. That's freaking child pornography! Maybe you could go first. My boobs and butt are so small, it's embarrassing. L-O-L. God, you sound so cute, LOL. Please show me. I promise, I will love it. Okay, Jason, you're like objectifying me. So stop it, asshole. I'm gonna go for the Hail Mary. I just want to meet up. Jason is typing. I don't know, especially, if you're not willing to let me see anything. Fuck. You got this, you got this. Don't think about it. Holy shit. Holy shit. What the fuck? Oh, my God! Ew, money, that's money. Uh ha. No. No! Nicole, no, hang up. - Benny, is that you? - Nicole, don't look. - Benny, what are you doing? I told you, I'm busy. You have to respect my privacy when I'm working. Who's boobs are those? Fuck. Yo, why did you hang up? Yo, what the fuck? I told you I'm busy. Okay, sorry, geez. What were you doing though? - I was just... - What? I don't know. What did it look like to you? It looks like you were pushing your boobs together. Shit. Wait, is that for him? - Uh, yeah, but- - Okay, so we're getting him? I wanna be there. I wanna see his face. - Whoa. Easy. First of all, there's no, we, all right. I'm sorry to break it to you, but there's never been a we. I'm not gonna film myself busting a pedophile with my 16-year-old partner in crime because that is fucking insane. Second of all, he's not gonna meet up with me unless I send him a nude. So I'm fucked. Okay, so just Google like pictures of naked little girls and then send one to him. No, it's not that simple, all right. He's smart, okay. He's gonna reverse image search anything I send him. He'll know if I got it off the internet. Well, what about the picture that you just took with your chest? Believe it or not, it's too fake, so it doesn't work. Well, I'm not gonna let Megan spend one more night in a house with that monster, okay. I know, okay, I get it. I don't know if I'll be able to get this guy anytime soon, okay? Why? Because the sheriffs' on my ass, they've got cops following me around and now news reporters are stopping me on the streets for interviews. So what? So my block is too hot right now, all right. I wanted to get this guy tonight before my interview goes out, but I don't think that's gonna happen, okay. What if... I sent you a pic? - No! No, absolutely not! And why, I have a bunch, well, I have a few already. And they don't even show my face so I can just send you one and then you can send it to him, but then we can get him tonight. No, because you are 16 years old. That is completely crossing the line, all right. Since when do you give a shit about crossing the line? You do whatever it takes to get these guys, right? You're like a fucking superhero. You really think so? I do. You put your life on the line every day to take down like the most evil people on Earth. Your videos literally inspire millions of people, like including me. You're like fucking Batman. Let me be your Robin! Come on. Who would play me in the movie then? Tom Holland, looks-wise. What, no, fuck that. That kid is like a total fucking squirt. I'm double his size. Okay, but he's so cute. Yeah, he's so cute. He's like little and you can put him in your pocket and then go walk around with him. I'm like a ruggedly handsome man. Okay. You don't think so? No, I... I do think so. Thank you. Yeah, welcome. Okay, I just sent it to you. Oh my God, no, Nicole, no, no. Why did you just do that? I already did it. It's done. No, I'm going to immediately delete whatever you just sent me, okay. No, you won't. Yes, I will. Why did you do that to me? So then you can send it to him and then we can get him tonight. No, it's gonna go straight into the trash, all right. Benny, if you don't do something tonight, then I will, okay. The fuck is that supposed to mean? Shit, I gotta go. No, no, no, hold on. What does that mean? What'd you do, come on? Oh, Jesus, fuck. - Come on, now, let's go. - Yo, what the fuck? Jesus, why do you look so freaked? - Yeah, you good? - No, I'm fine. What's up, what are you guys doing here? What do you want? Uh, poker night. This dude won't leave you alone. I know, I'm fucking sick of him. Yo, are you gonna send him pics? Mm, maybe this will get him excited. Oh my God, is that you? Hell yeah, boy, that's fucking me. Wait, what? You know, I'm guessing it's stuff like this that the sheriff views as inadmissible evidence. Let me see, let me see. Okay, yeah, well, the sheriff is a power hungry bitch who doesn't know what the she's talking about so she can get fucked. Holy fuck, this is hot. Fucking right, it's hot. Look at those curves, son. It's like bow-chick-a-wow-wow. Oh damn, can I send myself this pic? No, you cannot send yourself that fucking pic. Give me my phone back. What, I'm only gonna use it for jacking off. That's why I don't want you to fucking have it. Wait, so you're like still going after this guy with like all the shit that's going on? No, probably not until things have cooled down a little bit, which sucks because a viewer actually tipped me off about him. Damn, who's this, she's cute. Who's who, what are you looking at? Give me that back. I accidentally swiped, chill out. This chick. Yeah, no, that's, yeah, that's the girl who tipped me off, Nicole. The guy is her best friend's dad. - This fucking guy has a kid? - Yep. He's a dad, a husband, a math teacher, an extremely developed individual in the eyes of society asking a seventh grader for nudes. Can I have my phone back now? Wait, wait, wait, wait, let me see. Fine. All right, so like what's her deal? She's a hardcore fan, you know, she's been commenting on my page since like the very beginning. That's really it. - Hmm. Can I have my phone back now? She looks pretty young. Yeah, no she is. She actually still goes to East Birchwood. Oh, shit, Bulldogs, represent! She's in high school. She's so smart, but she loves theater. She's like a total drama geek. And she's always like talking about theater this, theater that. It's just, she makes me laugh sometimes. But yeah, we would've never talked in high school. I raise five. Do you guys like talk a lot now? Don't go through my messages, okay. Hey. I shouldn't have to tell you that. Sorry, man, fuck, I call. Whoa. Dude, why don't you just like take what you have to the cops, all right? It sounds like you have plenty of dirt on this guy. Fuck those pigs, all right. Cops think that chat logs are too flimsy on their own anyways so it wouldn't even fucking work. Let's just invite his ass over. Oh, duh! Fuck yeah, let's invite a predator into my home. Show him where I live. Maybe deal him in for a few hands. No, we'd beat the shit out of him. Great idea, Ryan. I'm sure your parole officer would love that. Why would we tell him? Okay, you know, this is like my monthly one night out from Ben and Charlie, all right? I don't know. I don't think it would be very kosher if I assaulted someone. Yeah, I really, I hate to break it to you, Ryan, but nobody's getting their ass beat tonight. Not when I got all this heat on me, you know, I'm a wanted man right now. Damn, so I guess you're about to lose your biggest fan then, huh? I'm sorry, what did you just fucking say to me? What was that one word you just said, lose? I don't know what that word means. I've never even really encountered that word. Could you spell it for me? Spell it out. All right, I check. No, no, no, I'm being dead serious, Sam. I mean, can you use it in a sentence? Like, I don't know. Sam is about to lose a shit ton of money on this hand. I'm just saying, if you just let this guy keep doing what he's doing, well, this girl, she's gonna hate you. Fuck, goddamn it. All right, you fucking win, okay? - I tried to tell you. - Fucking hell. Brian, give me my laptop. Here. - Dude. - Fucking eh, yo. - Since I'm, you know... You're the one who owns the chips, also. I just invited him over. Fuck, yeah. What, wait. What the fuck? What the fuck, man. Why did you do that? I gotta do this video, tonight. So we're beating his ass? Let's fucking do it. I'm down, I'm fucking ready. No, no, no, let's just message him and tell him not to come. Benny? Benny, call it off, dude! Oh my. Sam, calm the fuck down. I have a plan. You just said that you don't want this man in your home. Okay, we can't make one of your videos. So call it off. We're gonna make a different kind of video. What the fuck are you talking about? I still think that we should just beat the outta this animal. Oh, shut up! Oh, I'm like nervous. I'm like almost shaking. I feel like I was like... What? Hey. What you girls watching? Nothing, what do you want? I'm just headed out for a bit. Wanted to say, bye. - Okay, whatever. Hi, Nicole. Hey. Hey, there she is. Okay, goodbye dad. Okay, yep, I'm leaving. Bye-bye-bye. This guy's like, weirdly hot. Hey, I just realized that I forgot my toothbrush at home. So I think I'm just gonna drive home and grab it. Okay, do you wanna ask my dad for a ride? No, no, no, it's okay. I have my car. - Okay, well come back quick. Okay, I will. Love you. - Love you. Hey, where are you going, honey? I'll be right back. Okay, okay, okay, okay. So we can't bust him, right? - Yeah. We can't beat him up. This is fucking ridiculous. Let's just message him and tell him to go home. All right, what if I pretend to be the girl? - What? - Yeah. I'm small, right? I'm sure Benny's got like a wig or some shit I can wear. And then what, huh? You gonna suck him off or something? No, Sam, I'm not going to suck him off. Okay, so please tell me what... Hey, guys, So I've been suspicious that my friend's dad has been doing some shady shit, which has been confirmed by CreepDunk so go ahead and subscribe to him 'cause he makes really good vids. Okay, anyway, so I've been following him for like 10 minutes and I think he's gonna go meet with an underage girl. So let's see where this goes, okay. After I sweet talk him for a little bit, it's just start getting hot and heavy. - Hot and heavy? - Yeah. Like for the fucking video, Sam, keep up, all right. Like maybe we're on the bed, he's got his hands on me, he's about to kiss. He's obviously hard as fuck. You gotta be kidding me. And then, boom! You guys come out in fucking ski masks, right? You come out, when you scream, you scream, we got you motherfucker! We got this on shit tape. And he's sitting there like fully about to fuck this little girl. Jesus, I'm done with this, I'll fucking message him. No, wait Benny, come on. You like my plan, right? Wait, what is happening right now? Fuck, he's here. Okay, okay. Okay, so he's parked in front of this house. Oh, and I can't see what's going on inside 'cause the blinds are all closed. Set up a hand, okay? Follow my lead. No, no, no, no, no, no, no I can't. I can't, I can't do. I can't do this. - Sam, shut the fuck up. And whatever I say, no matter how fucked up it is, just go with it. Yo, what's up dude? Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry. I must have the wrong house. No, you're the um, you're the math tutor, right? You're here to see Lizzie? Uh? It's Jason, right? No, I, I, well, uh, yeah. That is your name, isn't it? Yes, yes, uh. I'm sorry, you're her? Her brother. No, no, no, stepbrother. Our parents are off to Aruba. So she's staying at my place. It's their annual spring getaway, you know? I can't see who he's talking to. He looks nervous. He's like moving his arms around, uh. Okay. Yeah, she's just out running a few errands, but she should be back really soon, so. Oh, okay. Well, that's fine. I'll just come by some other time. No, no, no, man. Me and some buddies are just playing some poker right now. If you want, we could totally deal you in for a few hands. You could kill some time. Maybe have a drink if- Oh, I, I don't. No, I, I- - Are you sure? Thank you, though. She said she's got that super important test tomorrow and it sounded like she really wants to see you, like tonight. You know, it's, uh. It's pretty late. You know, let me just message her real quick and see if she wants to meet like early tomorrow or something. Sure, sure, man. Whatever works. Everything all good, man? You seem a little nervous. Oh, no, no, no, I... Okay, um. She said that she still wants to meet tonight. So great, come on in. It's freezing. Okay. Atta boy! Right this way. Fuck. Yo, this is Jason, Lizzie's math tutor. This is Sam. - Hey. - And this is Ryan. - Yo. - Yo. - Yeah. He's just gonna kill some time with us until Lizzie gets back, so. Sorry to interrupt, fellas. Dude, no way. You are not interrupting, all right. But do you have cash, is the only thing? We are playing at a $50 buy-in tonight. Oh, no, no, no. I'll just, I'll just sit down and watch, you know? - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, she'll be back soon, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, really, really, really soon. Let me grab you a drink. How about that? As the Spaniards say, "Mi casa es su casa, amigo". So just chillax. Take a load off. Make yourself comfortable. Boys, where were we? I'm out. It's your bet. Hmm, what do I want to bet? I bet. This much. Jesus Christ. Oh, fuck. Dude, do you remember that girl I was telling you about? Check out this fucking text? Is she fucking asking for it or what? Oh, um, yeah, yeah. Doesn't get much more blatant than that. Check it out. Can you assholes gimme a second? Oh, that's... Cool, nice. - Yeah. That's good for you. Are we gonna play this fucking game or are we just gonna sit around, all night? What's going on? - Right, right, uh. I, uh. I call. Turn 'em. You motherfucker! I could have sworn you had nothing and then you bust this shit out? You know, that's poker for ya. Come on! Fuck, dude, I am fucking wasted. But I've got you fuckers exactly where I want you. Who's deal is it? Eh, I, you know what? I'll sit in for a couple of hands. You know, I mean, you know, if the offer is still on the table. You sure, man? No pressure. Yeah, I'll just kill some time while I wait for Lizzie to get back, you know? I fucking love it! Let me get you set up. Here, take a seat. Here. So you're tutoring Lizzie? Yeah. - Yes, algebra, right? Here, Sam. - Yeah. You can deal with the cards. Yeah, it's just uh, thanks. You know, I'm a high school math teacher, but it doesn't hurt to make a little extra cash on the side, you know what I mean? - Totally. Oh yeah, they don't pay teachers enough. Heroes, all of ya, check. Man, that's, that's so crazy. What is? Oh, I mean, I don't wanna brag or anything over here, but I actually slept with my math teacher back in high school. - Really? - Yeah. Isn't that funny? Yeah. I actually saw her today before we played. She was in the classroom. Wait, really, Mrs. Wiles? Yeah. How did that make you feel? Made me feel pretty damn good considering she's still hot as shit. - Damn, for real? - Yeah. Shit man, you don't know what Mrs. Wiles looked like, bro. You do not know. Ass like a goddess. Every dude in that school dreamed about her ass and this guy fucking fucked it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean it is, it is true. That's uh, that's some pretty crazy stuff, man. Yeah. Yeah, it was. Oh my God. And it happened on the school property, too. She held me back after class so we could have a talk about my behavior. It was straight out of a bad fucking porno, dude. I swear to God. - Wow. I can't fucking blame her though. Huh? You should have seen me. I was a freaking stud. I can only imagine what it's like for guy teachers, you know. I bet $10. - Fold. How do you mean? Call. Just, high school girls these days, man. I've seen them. If I were you, I wouldn't be able to keep my eyes on my own paper if you catch my drift. Yeah. I mean, like once these girls develop, you know, fold also, but yeah, biologically speaking, it is quite difficult actually to really tell the difference, you know? Yeah, I would for sure fuck one of my students, if I was you, bro. That's why you're not a teacher, Ryan. I can't be a teacher 'cause of my DUIs, but- So um. What uh, what happened with you and her? - Ms. Wiles? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. The teacher. I bet. $10. Fold. Yeah. Did anybody find out? Call. Yeah. Her husband was my basketball coach. - Shit. - Yeah, shit indeed. He found out. She kind of played the victim and he fucking lost it. He cut me from the team. He made me lose all my scholarships. And guess what? She still fucking teaches there to this day. Jesus, man. Why, why'd you do it? Got tired of fucking cheerleaders, bro. Yeah. Was it, was it worth it? Yeah? Was it worth it? Hell fucking, yes, it was worth it. It was the best sex I've ever had in my fucking life. I hated basketball anyways, to be honest. I mean, honestly, I'm just surprised you didn't press charges. Yeah. You and me both, buddy. - Yeah. You and me both. But lemme tell you something. Deep down, she really fucking liked me. She liked it a lot more than I did, if you know what I mean. We had fun. Yeah, it sounds like it. You know what? I bet. 20 bucks. Boom, how is that for some fucking fun, am I right? Call. Flip 'em. Are you... That's all you had, man? That's it? Oh, okay, whatever, all right. Come to me. Oh yeah, but hey, that's a nice hand. - Yeah. - You got me. But let me tell you, bluffing, it's a big part of this game. Yeah, well, it looks like all that wallowing in your past took your head out of the fucking game, am I right? Wait, what the fuck did you just say to me? Oh, Jason! Looks like you need a refill, my guy, right? Little bit, top off. So uh, am I drinking alone? What's going on fellas? No, of course not. Ryan, pour us all another round. You sure, man. I'm pretty wasted. - Yes, I'm fucking sure. Come on, we're having a good time. It's the boys. Let's keep the party fucking going. - Hey, dude. - Okay. Jesus Christ. It sounds like there's like a whole group of guys in there. Okay, I feel like I should warn you guys that this might be way more fucked up than I thought, but I feel like I should go see what's going on. So it's just gonna go up there and knock on the door. Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hello, hey, you. Roll down your window, open. Open your window, roll it down. Roll it down. Hello, I need to talk to you. Roll down your window. Roll down your window. Who are you? Why are you at this house? How do you know who lives here? I'm a friend of Benny Jansen's. Excuse me? Benny Jansen, this is his house. Isn't it? - No. - Are you filming me? - Yeah, I'm filming you, yes. Are you a friend of Benny's? How about you answer my questions first, okay. Hello, fucker.

I mean, I probably shouldn't be telling a teacher this, but yeah. Right, Sam? Uh. It's like our thing. Huh? Because I showed you this guy and I gave you everything that you need to know. And it's always excuses. Like it can't happen tonight. It can't happen tonight. And then I follow him to your fucking house. What are you having dinner together or something? We're playing poker, okay Nicole. Well, then. Nicole, no, listen, you have to trust me. Then you have to tell me what's going on. I, you know, man, I'll go to bars and I'll, you know, play a little game called spot the girl who got in using a fake ID and then, and by the time they're back at my place, they don't even know what it hit 'em. How about you, Sam? Do you play spot the- Oh no, no, no. I, yeah, I haven't in a while. I've been married a few years with a newborn actually. But before that, I used chat rooms. Dating apps. Interesting. I have to get back in there, okay. I just, I have to. I can't explain everything to you right now, but all you need to know is I'm making a video that's gonna be the best fucking video I've ever made. But I need you to leave right now, please. Benny, that doesn't explain anything. I'll send you the footage once it's all over. Oh my God. I could have just done this without you, you know? I should have. Fuck. Hey, everything go okay out there? Yeah man, we were just talking about how crazy these young girls can be. Yeah, yeah. Woof, she just wants it like really bad but I told her, not tonight. Tonight's is boy's nights. Man, from what these guys were telling me about her, she sounds like she could be the change of luck you need tonight. You did not have the conversation I just had because she is fucking nuts. The wildest ones are always the hottest, though, man, right? Yes sir, that's the killer, isn't it? She is quite physically mature for her age. So uh, so you got like a picture of this girl? Oh shit. Oh shit! You dirty dog! Hey man, this one's mine. You gotta go out there and get your own. Come on, you know, I know- I knew this guy was a sick fuck like us, man. Come on, man. The age of consent is 16 in Nevada, student or not. Look you guys are crazy, okay. Everybody knows, there's nothing better than young pussy. Nothing. Well, first of all, I bet 10. Second of all, okay, yeah, I've dipped my toes a little. - Whoa! - Yeah, man. All right, all right. That's what I'm fucking talking about, man. I fucking love it, bro. One of your students? I fold, man, I'm out, I'm out. No, no, no, no. Who's gonna tell us then, man. How do you find these girls? Benny, you in? - Oh yeah, man. I am fucking in. - Well, I fold. Yeah, you know, I mean, same as you guys, just chat rooms, dating apps. I've been married, God, since I was like fucking 18, you know, it's still the best way to do it. - Really? - Oh, yeah. I mean, she has no idea. She doesn't go through your phone, your laptop? It's your bet by the way. No, no, I delete all the files after I save them to a hard drive. Oh, uh. 10. I uh... Call. I mean, you know, I mean the things that these girls will say, you know the pictures that they will send, it's fucking wild. Yeah, you gotta, well, I say, I save it all for a rainy day. 15. I bet you got some nasty stuff in there. You wouldn't believe. Oh! I would love to see it. Yeah, I'm sure. Call. Oh, ha! You gotta be fucking kidding me. I'm sorry, man. Listen, I don't mean to be taking all your money tonight. You know that, right? You're pretty good at this shit, aren't you? I play online pretty regularly. Mm, so you're a degenerate. I've made more money doing this than, than anything else, you know? - That's impressive. - Fucking cool, man. Yeah, sure. You know, I mean, you should give it a shot, honestly. You know like if you spent your time doing something useful, instead of whatever, futzing around on YouTube, you know, maybe you wouldn't be losing all your money to me tonight. Oh! That's funny, futzing around? Oh fuck, that's funny, man. You're really funny. What's so funny about it? I mean, futz, is kind of a funny word, right? Like what the fuck does that word even mean? You have no idea what's coming your way, buddy. No idea. What are you talking about? So deal the fucking cards then, Ryan? Anty up. I'll check. Check. Ryan, pour our distinguished guest another drink. Oh no, no, no, I'm okay. I gotta stay sharp for Lizzie. Yeah, yeah, man, he can't teach Lizzie how to figure out what X is if he's hammered, right? Are we seriously still going with that? Still, going with what? You're here to fuck her, right? All in, by the way. I uh, I fold. - Hold on, excuse me? Jesus Christ, I'm not your fucking wife, Jason. You don't need to bullshit me. It's still your bet. I'm sorry. What are you talking about? I popped her cherry, okay. I know she fucks and I know she likes older men. Are you, are you. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. What's going on? What, what, what the hell's going on? Ryan, tell him you fucked her, haven't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, a bunch of times. Sam hasn't 'cause of the old ball and chain. But look at him, I know he wants to. So just say it. You think you're the first math tutor to come over here and fuck my stepsister? I'm cool with it. I guess it's my lucky night then. I'm all in, too. I fold. Flip em. Oh! Woof. That's all you have? It's not looking good for you, buddy. Can this be our last hand? I feel like we should probably call it a night. No, that would be poor manners. No running our new friend off the table like that. Fuck, yeah! It's a shame. Huh, what is? You losing all your money like this? No. I just thought she was a virgin. Is that like a, a deal breaker for you? No, it's just, it's just different. How is it so different? Well, I mean, well, you know what it's like, you know, to be the first, you know. I bet she didn't even know what she was doing, right. You know, when they're that young, they can fit right in the palm of your hand. You know, they're so nervous and cute. Confused, though too, sometimes. But you know, you're there to take care of 'em, to just like, you know, walk 'em through. This one girl, this one time, she told me that I made her feel safe. You know? And fuck, man, they're always so eager, right? And they're so eager and they wanna do a good job because you're showing them everything. And you're in total control. They want you to be in control. And they'll just do, you know, fuck man, they'll do anything to make you happy. Anything. Hmm? A six makes a straight. - So have you done it before? - Yeah. A couple times. A couple girls online. Though, you know, it did, it did kind of start with one of my students. Madison. She was a troubled kid. Always messing up in school, smoking weed in the bathroom and during lunch, acting out in class. She was smart though, you know. We had a good relationship. She stopped by after class, told me about her family, her whole life, how lonely she was, how hated by everyone she was, bad friends, bad guys, you know, just teenage girl shit. And I'd just make her laugh. Tell her she's the smartest kid in class. Fucking one day, she had a panic attack, band practice, started hyperventilating into her French horn. She was like. It was just like ridiculous, you know? That's how I just, you know, I just offered her a ride home. And then. Just happened. Back of the car. Side of the road. And then I drove her home. I think, she killed herself that night. Okay, Jesus. That's a fucked up story, man. Oh shit. You gotta be kidding me. You gotta be fucking. Oh man, hey, I'm sorry, man. Hey listen, you want some money to buy yourself back in or something? 'Cause like, I don't care. You know? You fucking sick piece of shit! You fucking sick motherfucker! I'll fucking kill you, you fucking bitch! Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off me! Fucking psycho, you're fucking dead. You hear me? You're fucking dead, bitch! You're sick, you're sick! Get the fuck off me! Guess what bitch, I got you! I fucking got you! There was no Lizzie. That was me! You dumb cunt, I got you! I got chat logs and I got it all on video. Please, please, I'm sorry. I'm drunk, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Please, please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just let me go. - Oh, this is so fucked. Looked how fucked up he is! You almost killed him! Please, please, please, please, let me go. This never happened, okay? It never happened. Shut the fuck up! Fuck. Fuck. I'm outta here man. Hey, hey, hey, what are you talking about? Where the fuck are you going? Home, Benny! I want to go home! - Just hold the fuck on. - No. You said it yourself. You can't hurt these guys. It's over, it's over, you're fucked. I don't want to be a part of it. You are a part of this. You're not fucking leaving! Just give a minute! - Please please, please. Please, I won't tell anybody. I won't tell anybody. That's bullshit, man. He's gonna go straight to the cops and spin some fucking sob story about how we mugged him or some shit. Ryan, shut the fuck up! God, let's just fucking take all of his shit, put a bag over his head, roof him and drop him off in the middle of the fucking dessert or something. Are you fucking stupid? What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm not the one who flipped out! No, we have to call the police. No, no, fuck that, Sam. Do you understand how much shit I will be in? Yeah, no cops, no cops. We took it too far. Benny fucked up. It's over, I'm calling the fucking police. - Sam, give me this. - Get the fuck off of me. Hey! - Motherfucker, get back here. - No, no, no, no, please. Everybody stop! We're not calling the cops. We're not gonna drug and kidnap him. So what then? We're gonna let him go. - Are you fucking serious? - What the fuck? Do you really think he's gonna go to the cops with this? Hey Mr. Officer, these guys beat me up. Why, you ask? Oh, funny story. I was trying to fuck this 13-year-old girl. So, we do it. Explain everything, deal with the consequences. Is that really what you want, Sam? You want the cops involved in this? You wanna fuck up your entire life, with a husband and kid? Oh, not to mention Ryan's fucking life. We didn't even do anything. You didn't do anything? Oh yeah, sure, come on. You really think you didn't do anything? Fuck you. - No, no, no. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Hey, shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up. Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna go home. You're gonna tell your family, you got too drunk. Got into some bar fight. And then you're gonna take a shower and go to bed. That's it. You're not gonna do something stupid, okay. You're not gonna go to the cops and ruin your life just because you got your ass kicked. This never happened. And you're never gonna touch another fucking little girl ever again. Uh huh, huh. Good, now get the fuck up and get the fuck out of my house. Your coat. Hey! Benny, no! Okay, it's okay. That's okay. You're okay. You're okay. - Oh fuck. - You're okay. No, no, no, this isn't happening. No, no, no, no. Benny, why the fuck is she still here? Give me the gun! Put the phone down, Sam. Let her go. Now, Ryan! I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, please, no. What are you doing here? How did you even get in here? I came in through the window, I'm so sorry, I did not mean. Oh goddamn it. Please, don't hurt me! Okay, everyone just needs to calm down. You just murdered someone in cold blood! Should I just have let him leave? You want him to go out there and do this shit all over again, huh? What was I supposed to do? Call the cops! That's not an option, okay. So shut the fuck up about the cops! Fuck you! Benny, gimme the gun. Oh, what the fuck? What the fuck, man? I told you, we're not gonna kill her. You fucking asshole, you broke my fucking nose! Shut up, shut the fuck up! Shut up, all right, shut up! The two of you just need to shut up and sit down for one second, okay. Everything is gonna be fine. It's fine! I just need a minute! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, you're okay, you're okay. I got you, okay. You're safe, I got you. I got you, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. You're okay. Hey, look at me. You're okay. I'm sorry about this. I am. I didn't want this. This wasn't supposed to happen. You coming back and being here right now, I think that was supposed to happen. It was, it's like destiny, you know? What do you mean? You were at his house before, right? - Yeah. - Beautiful. We're gonna go there together, okay. What? He said, he saves all of his conversations on hard drives. Did you hear that part? I don't know. Okay, well the last conversation he had was with me inviting him to this address with your picture attached. Yeah, so we're gonna go there together, okay. You and me, like as a team, all right? You and me together, one unit. And we're gonna find those hard drives and we're gonna make sure we get rid of them so no one knows he was ever even here. And then it'll be over. While we do that, Sam and Ryan are gonna deal with the body. - Are you fucking serious? - Fuck that! Just shut the fuck up. Hey. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? No. This is the right thing to do, okay. This is the only thing to do. It's over. He's gone. Now, we have to protect ourselves 'cause we're not bad people. We didn't do anything wrong. We just messed up a little bit. Benny, he's dead. You killed him. - I know, I know. I know, I know but it's like Batman, right? He never killed anyone, right? Like not even his worst enemies. It was like his moral code or whatever. Yeah. Well, wouldn't it have been a lot better for everyone if he just went ahead and killed the Joker? Like the first time he had the chance? Do this with me, okay. Be my Robin. Okay. Okay, I'll help. - Great, amazing. It'll be quick and easy, I promise. No more bad stuff is gonna happen. Okay. Where the fuck are we supposed to hide a body? Benny, please. Please, please, just let me go home. Take my car out to the middle of nowhere. This is just so insane. I've got gloves and bleach you can use to clean up all this in here and then you can move the body into my car. There's a shovel and flashlights outside. Jesus Christ. Take the 204, go past the river and then bury him as deep as you can. You're not being serious, are you? Yes, I am. Nicole and I will deal with the hard drive, all right. I'll take his car and I'll hide it out back and I'll deal with it tomorrow. And that's the plan. That's what we're going to do. - No, it isn't. - Sam. You want me and Ryan to bury the body of a guy that you killed? Sam, please, I fucking, I need this. Do you realize how fucked up that is? Sam please, All right, I'm, I'm... I'm sorry, I don't know, I don't know. I, I love you. All right? I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life in prison. Not for this. Sam, I need you to do this for me. I'll do it. Sam? Fuck, fine, fine, fine. Great, the boys. All right, clean up in here. My car's out front. Text me. Just keep me updated, you know, but nothing specific. I'll do the same. And throw this in the river for me. I can't. He deserved to die. I know. Ready to go? Hey, Meg. Hey, sorry. Sorry, sorry, yeah. I know. Actually the, you know, I've kind of been talking to the guy from CreepDunk, Benny. Yeah, he actually texted me and he wanted to, he wanted to meet up. So yeah, I know it's crazy. Yeah, so we've just been hanging out. Yeah, no, he actually is. He actually is that tall. One second. Sorry. Yeah, he wants to meet you. So can we come over for a minute? We'll be super quiet. He's even cuter in person. Great, yeah, okay, great, great. See you soon, bye. Okay, that worked. Yeah, she's a fan. I showed her your videos earlier. Oh, that's awesome. Can we listen to music? Because I'm kind of freaking out and loud music always helps me calm down. - Yeah, yeah, sure, whatever. - Okay, thank you. Just, ah. Fuck! Okay, so we have to be quiet and obviously, act like chill around Megan and stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got it. Okay, let's go. Did you look at my picture? What? The picture I sent you, did you look at it? No, no, I just sent it to him right away, I swear. It would've been okay if you did look. I wouldn't mind. Hey, girl. You look amazing. Do I look older? Yeah, yeah, for sure. - Are you okay? - Yes, yeah, I'm good. I'm good. I love how nervous you get around boys. It's so cute. Oh, yep, right? Hey. I'm Benny, how's it going? It's good, I'm good. Nice. Thanks for having us over. Oh, yeah, totally. And Nicole was showing me your videos earlier. They're so awesome. Nice, that's so cool. Thank you. This is so embarrassing, but I've literally been watching them all night. I'm like addicted. Would you guys be down like to just keep watching? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That sounds good to me. Yeah, sure, whatever. - Oh, okay, yay. - Great. Ready? Okay. One. Two. Okay. We don't need to do this. - Huh? What you talking about? - We can leave him here, in the car with the gun and we can go home and deny everything. Fuck that, we're not doing that. Help me find the fucking flashlights. Ryan, Ryan. Ryan, Ryan, Ryan, listen, okay! We didn't do anything, all right. What do we owe him? He's our fucking friend, Sam. Oh yeah, real, real fucking friendly using us as props so he can murder someone and then make us do the dirty work afterwards. No, it's bullshit. Dude, he fucked up, all right? He was trying to do the right thing. Was he? I mean, I wouldn't have shot this guy in the fucking face, but this is still like a net positive, right? I have a kid at home, man. I wanna see my baby. I wanna go home. I don't want, I don't want to fucking do this. It's all good, man. It's chill, all right. It's gonna be fine, just shut the fuck up, okay? Here we are. We just gotta get through this, okay. We've just gotta do it. What the fuck was that? - I dunno. Give me the gun. No. Goddamn it. Motherfucker! Oh my God. Holy fucking shit. You guys have been blowing my channel up! I can't believe you actually dressed up. I know, I mean, this guy, he was insistent on this weird Dungeons and Dragons role play shit. So I figured it, fuck it, let's just do it, you know? Whoa. He asked, fuck, my guy. It looks like, did you literally stuff your bra for this? Well, I am very method and I'm technically supposed to be playing a 14-year-old girl and they stuff their bras, right? Nicole did. What the fuck, Megan? Sorry, I mean, you did do that. Don't you have to go to the bathroom? What? The whole way here you were like, I really have to use the bathroom. There's a bathroom down the hall. Yeah, God, I do need to go to the bathroom. Is it okay if I use your bathroom? - Yeah. - Awesome, thank you. You guys should totally check out the one where it's like stupid old creep can't stand up. It's about the old guy in the wheelchair. It's so funny, okay. - Okay, yes, we will. Why are you being so weird? What, I'm not being weird. Yes, you are. You're being like extremely weird. I'm not being weird. Okay, he's a lot nicer than I thought he would be. And you're right, cuter in person. Yeah. He's a good guy. Okay. One time. Probably gonna take us on mostly side streets until we hit the highway, yeah? Ryan? Ryan? - What, yeah? You sure you're good to drive? Yeah, I'm chill. Just drive as like safe as you can, okay. Sam, I got it, all right. I'm fucking, I'm good, man. What's wrong, something wrong? - No, no, no. - Right. - You good? - Yes. If you're good then I'm good. But we have to fucking do this. Okay, just gimme the directions. Go out and take a left. What's taking him so long? I don't know, he's probably taking a shit. Ew, in my house? I don't know, Megan. So what's up with you guys? Are you like a thing? What? What the hell, no. Okay, so would you be like super pissed off if I hooked up with him? Megan? What? I just feel like he and I are getting along really well. I didn't want to like, step on your toes or anything. Megan, he would never do that. Okay, wow. - No, no, no. - Never mind. That's not what I meant. I just mean, Megan, we've literally been spending all night watching videos of him, catching predators who are trying to sleep with kids. I'm not a fucking kid! Megan, you're underage! Barely, like literally barely! Ryan, Jesus. Ryan, slow down. - Sorry, sorry. It's all right, Jesus. Oh God, okay. What? What is it? It's nothing, just focus on the road, okay. You're gonna take a left here. Okay, um, Ryan, don't freak out. - What? Don't say fucking shit like right now. - Ryan, Ryan. - What is it? I think someone might be following us. Oh fuck you, nobody's following us. Yeah, I'm probably just being paranoid. Are you being serious right now? I don't know, okay. This guy's just been behind us for a while. - For how long? - Since, um. Since we left Benny's. - Since we left Benny's! Are you fucking kidding me, of course, they're fucking following us. Okay, calm down. Why the fuck should I be calm? Who the fuck is following us? Okay, look, dude, we're in Benny's car, okay, okay. So I think, I think it might be a cop. - What? No, no, no, no, no, no. With all the shit that Benny's been through, maybe they put a tail on him. No, no, no, no, no, no, fuck! I'm on fucking parole, here. How am I being unfair? Megan, it's literally math. He is 26 and you're 15. God, okay, so then why the fuck did you bring him over then? Because I thought that you would think it was cool 'cause you like his videos. I like his videos because he's hot. I thought you'd bring him over so we'd like do stuff with him. That's fucking crazy! Ryan, don't drive crazy, okay. We can't get pulled over right now. No, no fucking way, man. No fucking way! Ryan, I need you to calm down. Okay, we can still lose him. Just take a right. Are they still there? Left. Uh, what the fuck? What the fuck is happening? I don't get why you're being such a bitch about this when you clearly have feelings for him too, Nicole. You're literally obsessed with the guy. You talk about him all the time. You're in love with him. - Shut up, Megan! Okay, now speed down this alley. - But you just said! - Do it! Okay, that ought to do it. Shit man, fuck that! Okay, um, okay, stop. Just keep going down all the way to the end of this alley. Make a left. - Okay. And then we'll get back on track. Ryan. Ryan, we're good, we're good. Okay. God, this is a fucking nightmare, man. Yeah, no shit. Oh come on. - Yeah, let's go. - Same car? - Maybe, I don't know. Just drive, now. He does not like me like that! So you think he just likes that you're a big fan? What are you even talking about? He clearly wants to have sex with you. No, he doesn't! Why else would he talk to you all the time and hang out with you? Because he thinks I'm cool and he wants to make videos with me, okay. He likes me. You're so dumb. That is so dumb. No, it's not! Look, he came here tonight because he wants to get laid. I'm sorry, you're too much of a virgin to understand that. You are such a fucking bitch! What the fuck should I do? Okay, hold on. I'm going on the freeway. Ah! Oh man, if he was a cop, he would have fucking pulled me over by now. Who the fuck is this guy? God, this can't be happening? You do not know Benny, okay! You do not know what kinda a person he is! He's just a boy, Nicole. I know enough. No, you fucking don't! You didn't even know who your own father was, okay! Or maybe you did, and you were too scared to do anything about it. Nicole stop, what the fuck are you talking about? Your dad is a fucking child molester. What? What are you saying? You're being fucking insane right now. No, I'm not. Your dad is a predator and Benny did something about it, okay, because he cares about people and he wants to protect them. Did what, Nicole? Nicole, what did he do? Did he do something to my dad? Where is he? Where the fuck is my dad, Nicole? What did he do? Oh, shit. Hey, what the hell are you girls screaming about? Jason? Uh. Who is that, who the hell are you? I'm just a friend of Megan's. He's dead, Benny killed him. What? Oh, no. What are you saying? We needed to do it, okay. No, tell me, tell me your lying. Tell me you're fucking lying to me. No, fuck this! What are you doing? I'm gonna see what this asshole wants. Gimme the gun. - No, fuck. - Sam, I'm not fucking around! - All right. What are you doing in my house? Uh. Answer me, who the fuck are you? Uh, oh... - Megan? - No, no, no. Megan, there's a man in our house. No, no, no, it's not like that. I can explain. - Sam, gimme the gun! - Ryan, no! Fuck this. Yo, motherfucker! Why the fuck are you following us? Who the fuck are you? Fuck. We did it to protect you, okay. I promise, I swear. - Mom! - What is going on? They killed him, they killed dad. Okay, I am calling the cops. No, no, no, no, Terry, please. Megan! - Terry, Terry, please don't. - Megan, give me your phone. No, please don't. Terry, no! It's just a matter of time now. I mean, how fucking long does it take to dig a... You okay, you good? They'll be back soon. They'll be back really soon. And then we'll go. And all this will be over. - Why, what is? - Okay. All right. - What is happening? Hey, hey, hey. Talk to me, okay? What do you want? I don't want anything. I just need you to listen, okay. Can you do that for me? Stop, stop, stop. Don't do that, okay? Terry, your husband, Jason, is a child molester. He has hard drives upstairs in his office full of conversations he's had with multiple underage girls. No, no, that is bullshit. That is bullshit. - It's not. I'm not lying to you, okay. I was one of them. I pretended to be a 13-year-old girl and he asked me for nudes. Okay, this isn't fake. This is very real. I need you to understand that this is real. No, please just let us go. Please, please let us go. Last night, I was making a video, trying to expose him, trying to stop him from doing any more terrible things. Things got a little out of hand. And he, is, he is dead. - What, dead? What the fuck, what are you talking about? - Okay. - What is going on? No, why are you doing this to us? Why did you do this? - Okay, stop, stop, stop! - No! - Stop! It's okay. - No. It's okay. Why? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know. Listen to me. Jason was a horrible, awful man, okay. He was a monster. I know, you know this deep down. He's dead now. He's gone and we're here. And I need you to listen to me very carefully, okay? Some people are burying his body in the middle of nowhere, as we speak. When they're done, they're gonna give me a call and we're gonna leave. After we've left, after a few hours, you're gonna call the police and report him missing. Do you understand? Are you crazy? I'm gonna call the fucking police on you. You're going to prison! Do you really want to do that? Think about it for a second. Think about it for a second. Do you really want the world to see this? You want everyone to know what happened here? Do you really want that, to know who your husband truly was? Do you even understand what that would mean for you? Do you know what happens to the wives of predators? So in a few hours, when we leave, what are you gonna do? Call the police. And? Report him missing. Yes! Thank you, thank you. Beautiful. I love you, I love ya, seriously. You're a gem. Okay, do you hear that? Everything's gonna be okay. Everything's fine. Okay, everything's good. How we doing, seriously, how are we doing? Okay. Where the fuck are they? I mean, how long does it fucking take? Is anybody hungry? I am fucking starving. Okay, that's one. Nicole? I'll make something. Oh my God, thank you. I love you. Literally, anything will be perfect. Like, cereal will be fine. Call me right now! Okay, what are we gonna do? Let's, let's watch TV! Okay, let's watch TV. Everyone loves TV. Okay, TV on. Commercials, boo. No, no commercials. We hate commercials. - Those are the things- - I was backstage and it was- Good morning, everyone. I'm Karen Thomas. Good morning Karen, I'm Paul Cooper. First this morning, Sheriff Margaret Harvey has issued a clear warning to the young man responsible for a series of vigilante style YouTube videos. - Holy shit. - This has to stop. Thank you, Paul. Morning news. - It's my interview. Correspondent Hannah Morgan had a chance to speak with this individual and got his thoughts in just- Oh my God, that's, they're talking about me. Holy shit, this is insane. His name is Benjamin Jansen. His YouTube channel is called- This is fucking crazy. Nicole, Nicole, come back in here! You have to see this! Her foot down, saying this is- No, that's dead wrong! Literally every single person that gets charged with my evidence gets convicted. Convicted, that's 100% conviction rate. What the fuck! My evidence is good. Why would you want to hide them? I'm not hiding anything, are you? Whoa, Hannah, I didn't realize you were gonna be so feisty in real life, I love it. Wow, I look pretty good, I look built, damn. Cases can't be properly prosecuted- I'm wearing my spy glasses, which looks stupid, but. Other than than, Jesus. On camera as a means of acquiring identifying information. No, no, no, what the fuck! What the fuck! This is fucking bullshit! This is all out of context. They're literally fucking everything up! This is so fucked! Oh fuck you, Hannah Morgan. Recently, a case involving a predator- Oh my God. It's Sam, it's Sam. Mute the TV, mute the TV. Holy shit, thank you God, thank you God. Sam, talk to me. What's going on? How are you? Why weren't you in your car? Sam? Hello? Hello? Who the fuck is this? You know, this was supposed to be easy. It was supposed to be you. Why did you have to fuck this up? Where's Sam? What did you do with Sam and Ryan? Benny, what's going on? Shh. I didn't want to kill him, Benny. I just. I can't let you ruin my life. I'm not gonna let you. Oh, so you're fucking tough now? Now that we're talking over the phone, is that it? Uh huh. Do you know what they do to guys who fuck little girls in prison, huh? I have your laptop. It's all gone, Benny. I deleted everything. Chat logs. Videos. You're about to get a text from yourself. Oh fuck. Fuck! Fuck! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Fuck, goddamn it. No, oh fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! What do you want, huh? Why are you doing this? Why are you calling me? I dunno know. In your house for a while now trying to figure out what to do. It's such a fucking mess. This whole thing. I was gonna kill you when you came back. But then I clicked one of your videos. I like 'em. I like what you do to people. I watched every video you on your channel tonight. Today. I'm sorry. I gotta go. I gotta call the cops now. No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait. I have something you want, okay. I have a girl, a young girl. I can literally bring her to you right now. Benny! Shh. All right, she's literally, she's tied up right now. I'll send you a photo. You're gonna love her. Nicole, Jesus Christ, I'm not gonna actually fucking do it, okay. I'm gonna use her as bait. What the hell does that mean? It means. I'm going to kill him. Okay, I'm back, I'm back. Did you get it? She's cute, right? She's hot, she's really hot. She can be a fucking model. She's young, I swear. It's hard to tell with all the makeup, but she's young, I promise. Hello? Hello? Are you there? Fuck! Wait, whoa, whoa. Unmute the TV. Nicole, unmute that. Always worked hard in class. I think you can actually tell he works hard on his videos, too. I think you can tell. To be fair, he was a very troubled kid. Sometimes he would practically kick the door in on his way in. And I'd say, you know, Benny, are we gonna have a good day today? And he'd say, I don't know what he would say. He always had some sort of comeback. And then on other days it was just zip, total silence, turtle mode, I call it when my students, anyway. You learn to spot that type of kid, if you're a good teacher. They're the ones that need the most help. Oh God.
