This one. - How long? - We don't know. We found the boy in the morning like this. We addressed him, but he didn't stir. Prepare a bath. Quickly. Come. - It's not my fault! - Go and fetch the doctor! One must be prepared for the worst. An organic cause for his high fever and sleep-like condition is not to be found. Is it exhaustion caused by the long and arduous journey? Or an inner struggle, a reaction to the present circumstances. Even if the boy lives through the night, it is likely that the fever has affected too many organs. Thus it is utterly impossible that he will attain manhood. My name is Angelo. My name is Angelo. My name is... Your name is Angelo. I am fine. I am feeling well today. I am fine here. Take a seat for a moment. Your name is Angelo. Your name is... No need to be afraid. Evil lies behind you. You have found safety now. You are one of us now. But that is also a big responsibility. Never forget that. There is still much that you must learn. But you will set an example. And you will live like a prince. Just a quick glimpse. How sweet. Well. There are many wise men who say many wise things. About all the wonders of the world. And we, who cannot travel to the far corners of the world, have to rely on what they report. That, for instance, in the north, people live in houses made of ice. And live on nothing but the blood of large fish. That in America people are savages, who eat each other. That in Africa, the negroes are overheated and are thus lethargic and lunatic. More like apes than men. Born slaves. Unable reasoning, or of creating. Because they are godless creatures given over to the devil from birth. I think it is always other people who determine who we are for them. Go on. I am very proud of you. Today you achieved your first grand victory on the path to becoming human. What's going on here? What are you doing? How did it happen? - But how? - I don't know. - Close the door! - I'm sorry. I did it as usual. - Come in, quickly. - Close the door! The boy is in excellent health. I thus recommend ten strokes of the cane as punishment. The name I gave you through your baptism has a meaning. Angelo is God's first messenger. I was seeking to educate you on the matters of honesty and charity, goodness and purity in all that you do. But today I am very sad. Both for you and for me. For even angels can fall. And that too is God's will. Come on. Get on the stool. Take off your trousers. Do it. - Angelo, please. - Come here! - What's the matter? - I don't know. Come. What are you doing here? What is it? What do you want? - What do you want? - Yes, what do you want? What happened? - You need to leave now. - No! - Go! - No! Let's go! Now! - Good day, Monsieur Angelo. - Good day. - Have you practiced? - Yes. Is it so? You have brought us great honor today, Angelo. It appears that you are perfect. It appears I can teach you nothing more. Ladies and gentlemen, we now will hear an Italian aria. Calm down. Out. Come. - Shall I take the flute with me? - You shall take nothing with you. The celebrations to mark my great day shall now begin. Reports on today's splendor spread far and wide and even the great tsarina has come to marvel at our wonders. I shall make myself a present. A new companion and counselor. The court Moor of noble blood, Angelo. He is a glorious warrior and of the highest aristocratic rank. A bright new light in our house. The elders tell how, in the middle of the land, there lies a hole, gaping in the red earth... The elders tell how, in the middle of the land, there lies a huge hole, gaping in the red earth, into which our enemies have been cast. Before I came here to serve the prince, I lived in a distand land in Africa. The elders tell how, in the middle of the land, there lies a huge hole gaping in the red earth, into which our enemies have been cast, doomed to never reach the bottom of the hole and damned to fall for all eternity. There the sun stands so close you can bring it down with an arrow. The peaks of the highest mountains are always on fire. There, the water in the rivers boils from the blazing mountains, running black and crashing down in cascades many a mile high. The woods are so dense that they bear eternal night and only the most fearsome creatures dwell in them, with fangs of more than an arm's length, with poisonous claws, and a seven-headed whip of a tail. Far beyond the woods, the roars of these fiercest of all animals can be heard. And the cries of the most unfortunate of all men. A mighty king rules there now, and his reputation as a merciless warrior in battle precedes him far and wide. He leads a mighty army of five thousand soldiers on elephant back, and lions and tigers on chains of gold, archers who never miss their mark, spear-throwers who can thrust their weapons powerfully at targets far away, soldiers who laugh in the face of every enemy. This king has one and 44 queens. 1,735 children carry his name. For he is a powerful man. And I am his son. When I was born... The Emperor. - Your Majesty. - Your Majesty. Is this your acquisition we've heard so much about? They say he is skilled in music and the sciences. Indeed. This is our Angelo. A glorious warrior and of noblest birth himself. A bright new light in our house. Another one? It seems that night never falls in your house with so much light. Surely you will allow me to borrow him for a short while. Would you go back to Africa if you could? No, Your Majesty. Why not? I am a stranger there. You mean that you are now a son of Europe? I am a son of Africa. But a man of Europe. I once had a court Moor too. When I was a boy. We loved him dearly. Alas he died before his time. Of melancholy. What a poison one's homeland can be. I hope you are not afflicted. Well? Your Majesty, what is the capital of "homeland"? And how many inhabitants does it have? Pick a card, please. Eight on top. Seven for the bank and four for you. Seven for the bank. Seven for the bank... And four for you. Eight for the bank. Excuse me. You have a visitor. Me? Who would visit me? His Majesty the Emperor has sent an aide, so that Mr Angelo is able to converse at length for once. Our mighty ruler to obey, we shall leave this place. Sisters, let us run away. Now return we home victorious, after battle fierce and glorious. And truly owe we humble thanks to our brave and valiant ranks. The Moorish king's brave army brings me now the cruel villain. He invaded our beautiful land. Now he is a prisoner, captured by my own hand. Bring the brute to me straight, that I pass judgment on his fate. Behold our glorious Moorish king, all who know him his praises sing. You strove my throne to usurp, our kingdom's peace to subvert. Chains shall be your reward, savage man. Your time has come. My scepter only need I wave to send you to a deep, dark grave. On you I shall unleash my wrath for strewing pain along my path. Your blood will flow a red so bright, your skull promises us all delight. Yet let not enmity be the sign, how all recall my royal reign. Gleeful strains I want to hear, grace and mercy I hold dear. The end of strife betokens joy, love we shall, and not destroy. So I extend my hands to you and bestow peace on you. Here, take the Moorish King's hand, who will spare your cherished life. Peace and mercy do I decree, that they may triumph, I set you free. Good evening! Let's go, dear friends. I once made my mother very cross. I cannot even remember how. But consumed by anger, she decided to have me caned. There was no such thing here, of course, so a servant had to rush home who had seven children, all well-raised, to help out by fetching his cane. In the meantime, the high council had explained to my mother that it would not be possible. In our history, no heir to the throne had ever been caned. The poor man had run home for nothing, for the servants were so unnerved that not one of them was willing to carry out the orders. And so it came about that servants forbade an empress to punish a son. Her fingers must have been itching to do it herself. As a result of this, I lack something today. Today, I wish I'd been given the cane, that I'd received the strokes from my mother herself. I could have been more than the son who would one day be emperor. Less, in fact. Simply a son. Today, I believe that this opportunity was taken away from me. Or are opportunities fundamentally dubious, intellectual constructs? Pardon me. You don't understand? Should one accept one's place in life, or should one stand up to it? Accept the facts or revolt against them? Sit down. Please, take a seat. Are you the emperor now and I the negro? Your majesty can claim to be anything. But not because I want to. Because I have to. Occasionally, I must be something against my will. And then? What am I then? A claim? And for whom would that suffice? Merely existing for others? Am I a work of art? Monsieur. Well... Angelo? Yes? The bedroom. Is that from battle? Does it still hurt? No. How long were you in the army? And how... You swine! - No. No. Come back. - Let me go. Please, come back. - Where are you going? - To church. To ask for an exorcism, as evidently my husband is possessed by a demon that talks through his arse. No. - Don't get dressed. - No, leave me alone. I'm cured. Your love has cured me. Just now the demon left my body through my arse. Now stop it, you swine! - I'll tell you everything. - Sure. Anything you want. Come on. - Everything? - I'll talk to you in the most decent manner. Really? Anything I want? Anything you want. Before I came here to serve the prince, I lived in a distant land in Africa. The elders tell how, in the middle of the land, there lies a huge hole, gaping in the red earth, into which we cast our enemies. But they never reach the bottom of the hole and are damned to fall for all eternity. There the sun stands so close that you can bring it down with an arrow. The peaks of the highest mountains are always on fire. Black water runs through the rivers, which boil from the blazing mountains, cascading down from on high. A mighty king rules there now. And this great warrior... And this great warrior is merciless... Will you help me with this? Your wedding band. Is he trying to disgrace me? For everyone to see? Is it true? I want to know if it's true! Yes. Who gave him permission to commit this outrageous act? Does he think that he is me now? Has he gone thick in the head? Were we too kind to him? Has that muddled his senses? Were we too kind not to castrate him straight away? Does he now think that he is among equals? And can therefore lay with a woman? And pick himself a home? Is he conscious of the consequences? My reply will be sent to him. As he does not want to give me his. As punishment, the prince grants you your freedom. Congratulations. Your services will no longer be required. I hope you have achieved your goal. You are free. I put my belongings next to yours. All right? All right? Why won't you speak? Say something. Anything. Just say something to me. Say something. For God's sake, say something! My name is Angelo. I am fine here. What is this? On green or orange? Green. Majesty. I envy you. I am told you have been living for some time in your own house. My doors have large, golden locks, like this one here. But I can't lock anyone out. My house is open to all. I am the house. These are all laws that I have decreed. I am being asked to repeal them. Should I do so? There is no warmth where there is no one. One decides upon a path, and not necessarily because it is the easiest one. And one invites everyone to follow suit. One makes them aware of the dangers, prepares them for the travails, and one steels oneself, for the sake of everyone's well-being. But what if, after a while, the first person turns around and goes back? And then another, and then another, and soon everyone? And they all cry out, "You, too! Come back with us!" "We are far better off where we were than where we are going." I don't understand. When we lay down to sleep, do we wish to wake up yesterday instead of tomorrow? Do we wish to live backwards? Against time? Shall rivers disappear into their sources? And we back into our mothers? We are trapped. In the image we once made of the world, and of ourselves in it. You are an interesting case. Have you at least achieved what you desired? Now, as your own master? - Majesty, this is the very reason... - Is to serve not the essence? But what does it mean: to serve? - Pardon, Majesty? - What does it mean, to serve? - One does what one is told? - No! No. One needs not to decide oneself, needs not to weigh up what is good and bad. One needs not to think! But what does that mean? What would it mean, not to think? Not to dream? Would that be better? All right then. Not to dream and not to believe. Yes. Perhaps therein lies salvation. How stupid I am. I, the first servant of the state, dreamt I was an emperor. What does the negro Angelo dream of? And now he approaches me and asks for salvation from his dreams? Did his dreams become too big? He doesn't want to serve them anymore? Would not allowing him that signify the end of my dreams as well? Pardon me. Forgive me my lack of courtesy and my errors. I was always under the illusion we were conversing on equal terms. Because I always have to do better, I can't do anything right. Because I always have to be special, I don't want to be a negro anymore. If that is all you wish for, then there is nothing I can do for you. Except to wish you luck, and to be grateful for your visit. I accuse myself and acquit myself. In my death all questions will be answered. Have you come here of your own free will to serve the good? My answer can only be yes. Worthiest master, in the name of all present here and of all brethren spread over the earth, this candidate searching for the light has been found worthy. Then, brother deacons, let brother Angelo see the light. All these épées you see pointed at you, are ready to defend and protect you. However, these épées may also be drawn by vengeful hands, should you ever break your oath as a Freemason. Still, we hope that... To our new brother. Again. Monsieur Angelo. It's all right. What a surprise. Monsieur. I did not expect you so soon. My daughter. Just like her father. Well. All right. Excuse the chaos. We're in the middle of renovations. We will split this room into separate areas. We're not finished yet. Far from being finished. - Yes. - But... I cannot bear all this chaos. But it does give an idea of what is to come. Well, if you like I can show you the room. Just let me know. From the extensive butterfly collection, we literally fly over to the Alps. And here we are trying to recreate a South American rainforest. And here, although the scaffold obstructs the view, will be the polar seas. And over there, we have Africa. I'm sure it is familiar to you. Is it like this, Papa? Fine. May I show you something else? Just a short while ago, we were collectors and now we are scientists. We have a duty... Oh, careful, please. Everything here, everything you see, must be preserved and categorized. It's our task to discover and recreate the order that governs nature. To foster our understanding. Yes? Almost every month new ships arrive with more crates. Brazil. But, of course, each new discovery raises new questions. And each exhibit demands a further one. This one, for instance, is only the male. - It's magnificent. - Yes. But it is no mere ornament. This is life itself. What is the point of beauty if no one sees it? What is the purpose of an example if we cannot consult and learn from it? To be able to peek at the cards of creation and learn nature's tricks. The Lord may have rested on the seventh day. But I won't have that luxury for some time. - Do you hear? - What? Hear what? I don't hear anything, Papa. On the count of three. One. Two. Three. - We are not to touch anything. - Pardon me, Madame. May I now lead Your Majesty to our Chamber of Continents? A rabbit. Is that him? Yes. It's a miracle. What does he represent? His attire... The first representative of the human race. It's an allegory. Stop! Please, stop her! I want to see him! Don't get too wild! "So now I am alone in the world," "with no brother, neighbour or friend, nor any company left but my own." "The most sociable and loving of men..." - Have a blessed advent. - Have a blessed advent. - Have a blessed advent. - Have a blessed advent. - Have a blessed advent. - Have a blessed advent. Have a blessed advent. Have a blessed advent. Let's go. Push. Now push! Hold on. Careful!
