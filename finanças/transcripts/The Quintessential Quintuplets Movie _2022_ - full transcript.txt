I was dreaming... From the day we met in Second Year high school A Dream, Full of Dreams Thanks for all your hard work We will notify you as soon as the bride finishes dressing. Excuse me. Have you by any chance seen the bride's sisters? Yes, they arrived very early. I see... Mr. Groom... The bride is calling you -What's up? I'm almost done, wait a minute. By the way, your sisters have already arrived, I don't know what they're up to. They remain the same as always. Always giving trouble. Felt like, I had that dream before How many times have I dreamed the same? For it to be so etched in my mind, it must be... A Nightmare. We are ready! Am I still dreaming? -I love you -I love you. -I love you. -I love you. I love you If it won't reach you Todokanai naraba If it won't get to you Tsutawaranai no nara This feeling gets lost Kono kimochi mo warikirenain da ne It's accelerating, words start to move Kasoku shite kotoba wa ugoku Please tell me more Motto takusan oshiete yo Hey, there's something, I don't understand is right here Nee wakaranai koto ga koko ni aru no kimi ga I like you, Very much, more than anyone Daisuki nan da dare ni mo makenai I even forget how to breathe. You're the only one I don't understand Kokyuu sae mo wasurechau kimi wa hitori wakannai yo The feeling I have never felt before Hajimete datta shitta kanjou wa Is blooming to seek a light. This crush, crush, crush, crush Hikari wo motome saiteru kono koi wa koi wa koi wa koi wa doko made How far will it go? Tsuzuiteimasu ka? - Yotsuba! -I got this! We made it! Once again, everything went well thanks to you. Especially you Yotsuba, lately you are improving a lot. Huh? Me? is it real ? We are quintuplets, that is not possible. I'm not lying! My eyes do not deceive me! Girls follow Yotsuba's example, train hard! Me as an example...? If we stay here longer, store will close. Oh, going for shopping ? Yes, we are going to buy Mom a present. Let's celebrate her recovery. The five of us have been saving for this day. Well, let's go buy that bouquet of flowers! Gosh, Ichika sure is bossy. - Come on girls. Yes! What flowers do you think she will make Mom happier? I think Mom once mentioned Carnations. Carnations? Yes. I'm not sure though... Yotsuba, how much money do we have? Let's see... huh? Did I drop my wallet? Could you find it? It's not around here. We had her before the game, she should be around. I'm going to search a little further. Yotsuba... What do I do? Everything is my fault. What should I do?! I'm really sorry girls, all because of me... It's not your fault Yotsuba. It is understood? I'm sure no matter who was wearing it, it would still be lost. Exactly. All our mistakes are divided by the five. Sisters... Not a replacement, but I found this pretty flower. So... What do you think...? Yotsuba That's... Sorry, I guess it's not... -We all found that same flower. -We're actually quintuplets I'm back. Aren't they home? Congratulations Mom! We are very happy that you will improve! Look! We picked these flowers for you. Thank you for not giving up. Thanks for everything! huh? she froze I knew is not enough. The greatest happiness I can have is being able to see them at five so healthy. I am also very grateful to them. Well we are done. We are going home? Are those from dad? I don't think so. Summer vacation passed in a blink of an eye. Although we will be busy with preparations for the school festival. You're taking a break from school, right, Ichika? Yes, for filming a movie. Won't absences affect you? I think so, besides Futaro-Kun said that he would give me private lessons. And still... I never thought we would come back to this place. We had no luck with that sudden eviction. Whoa!.. Everything is very clean! It sure was Ebata-san. -He was taking care of the place. -I knew it, a wide place is the best. Thanks, I'm retiring. Thanks, I'm retiring. Oh hi Itsuki. What are you doing in the staff room? I just came to ask about a topic that I did not understand in class. I see. I came for the school festival. I was asked to make some decisions as a class representative. Speaking of class reps.... Yes... I wonder how Uesugi-san is taking it. Anyway, it seems like it's a tradition for third-years to set up food stalls. Fried chicken, sausages, even buttered potatoes... Excuse me, let's continue the talk some other time, okay? The reinforcement classes in which I help are about to start. I thought talking about food would interest Itsuki. Has everyone gone home yet? Oh hello Yotusba. Sorry to bother you when you're so busy. Is it about the school festival? Give me a moment, I can't waste time. Raiha told me about it, I even checked it out. I will make you have an unforgettable summer. the other day. I saw a commercial for Ichika. She is a great actress. She made her dream come true. With the goal of being the number 1 teacher. I have to keep trying to achieve it -Yotsuba. Yes? Is there something you want to be in the future? Huh? It is a very sudden question. I have never thought about it! Well you have extraordinary physical abilities. With that in mind, you have many options. I'm sorry I kept you waiting. We are going to collect the information about the positions from last year. Are you okay with that? You said you couldn't waste your time. That's exactly what I mean. It's our last school festival, I don't want to regret anything. I decided that I am going to enjoy it. We don't have much time. And it is not enough. I'm counting on you. Yes, I'll take care of it! These were the most popular foods of the past year. Of course, if there's something you want that isn't on the list, please say so. I vote for the Takoyaki. The best option is not to risk something new. Besides, you went to the trouble of researching all of that, right? If we make Takoyaki, I will be able to show you my skills acquired in my work. Yes, it sounds fun. Any other ideas? I want to make Taiyaki! I something with Tapioca! And you, Miku? Any ideas? Pancakes... Let's see... It does not appear in the information for last year. But it can be a positive thing. Good idea, Miku. -Thank you Miku-chan. -I think this is a good idea. I'm sure it will be very nice. That's all for today. We'll get back to it later. Nakano-san. Do you think we can participate in the concert? Of course! The design club made these. Do you think people will come...? They are precious. If we put up some posters, that will surely help us. Yotsuba is very popular. Why is everyone going with her, and not with me? Reputation -I would like to send invitations to my relatives. -I've got it covered! An invitation...? No matter what we do, I'm looking forward to showing off my skills. Yes. I am anxious too. Planning to cook? People will come from outside, do you understand? If you screw it up you could make the whole neighborhood sick. I have improved. Also you will be there. So I don't have to worry. There is no way we will fail -Sorry for the wait. -Thank you for your hard work. Don't you think you're over demanding? Well, it's our last festival. Let's do our best so we don't have to regret anything. Our last festival huh...? Futarou-kun, I really appreciate you coming here to teach me, but... Shouldn't you be studying for your college exam? The festival must also be putting too much pressure on you. In fact, the results came in today. Stop, don't look at it! This is the one thing I don't want anyone to see. Oh yes, good. I'm happy for you. That's not fun. For your information, if anyone can pull it off, it's you. Please take care of all of us, now is the crucial moment. There is nothing to worry about. I'm sure both the studio and the festival will go well. Just wait for it, Ichika. I will make this the best festival ever. Just give it up guys! You are the ones who must surrender. -They haven't even eaten the delicious pancakes! -Tell them something Miku. This... There is no Japanese who hates Takoyaki! Right, Nino-san? Didn't you say you like pancakes, Nino-chan? Why do you take your side? That's not true, right Nino-san? Oh dear! What else can I do?! It was me who suggested it, so I'll take responsibility for it! Also, eating them and preparing them are two completely different things! Even I sometimes fail, I don't always have fluffy pancakes! It is useless to continue arguing. Let's do both, period! I never thought the class would split in two. You are right. Why did you suggest the pancakes? Fuutarou said that his mom often made bread for him. That reminded me of how things used to be in our family. Well, it's true... Hes bread, it was really fluffy Though, it's not something anyone can-match in a short time. Have you done them before? That was the first dish I tried to make. That's why I prefer takoyaki, and it's even better if it's a stall That's why you said that in such a direct way. I hate cowards who act behind the backs of others. Nino and Miku, so you were together. -Hello Fuutarou, did something happen? -It's nothing, I'm glad to see them together. Anyway, even if we are busy with various things, let's do our best to enjoy the Festival. What the heck was that? I need to consult something with Fuutarou, see you at home. Miku? -Fuutarou. -Yes? What's up Miku? There's something I really want to tell you before the festival. I see. I also have something to tell you. May I know what it is? Of course, Miku. I heard you got an "A" on your college overview test. Well done. It has been a long road. If they all get into a university, it will all be worth it. All those lessons were not in vain. Well yes... Hey Fuutarou. go out with me Oh wait, I didn't mean it that way. I need you to join me this Sunday. huh? huh? Hello Nino. Are you on your way home? Yes, and I was looking for someone to go with. I see. So I guess I'm sorry. I have to go to regularization classes Oh really? Yes, you are applied. N-Nino... How much did you get on your college overview exam? Unexpectedly I did not do badly, I got a "B". What's up? What should I do, Nino? I worked really hard, but I got this. I have no future! In the end I'm just a cheap imitation of mom! Being a teacher like her is nothing but a dream! Come on, calm down. I'm sorry I lost my composure a moment ago. The faculty said that he should discuss it with my parents. But doing that is... He's not that kind of father, huh? I don't mean that. I just don't want dad to worry too much. Worry? When has he worried? It is thanks to dad that we have been able to mature. I have been able to recognize that. Those flowers were definitely Dad's. He rarely takes things directly, but I think he is always on the lookout for us. That's not... For now I will discuss this with Professor Shimoda-san. Also, I heard that a famous professor will be giving a lecture in the near future. Nino, I have the invitation you asked for ready. No longer needed, I've changed my mind. Are you sure? Invite Dad? I don't know what he was thinking. I thought it was a good idea... Either way he wasn't going to come. He's never home, and he's always acting behind the scenes yes you are tough... But... Are those girls... Before we get into trouble, it's better to avoid them. I understand what you mean girls. It is rare that Nino being a girl is on the side of men, And so she must be seducing one of those guys, right? Exactly! If she's after Yuusuke, I... I don't stand a chance. -Sakura... -Cheer up. I think you misunderstand. The person Nino is interested in is not in the takoyaki faction. Take that for sure. So don't worry. I can't believe you! How can you be so sure about it? The class representative must remain neutral and cannot vote for any of the ideas. But what do you say?! That is beside the point! Exactly. Well it's because Nino... she likes me So try to get along. Uesugi-kun. Let's put the fantasies aside, okay? I feel sorry that Nino-chan be put into those fantasies. B-But, I'm telling the truth, seriously. I don't think acting behind the scenes is bad. I'm sure there's a reason for that. Yotsuba, let's think about what to write for the invitation. I don't remember letting you in, please leave immediately, Uesugi. Oh come on, aren't you being cold on me? I came because I have something to tell you. He is here. More than ten years have passed. Next is An-chan. And behind her is San-chan Now I have a question for everyone. Do you remember the name of this little guy? They all look the same. I can't find the differences. I want to guess. They are like you. Now that you mention it, that reminds me of Nino. So that would be you? Fuutarou... Futarou, I want to study cooking. So I'm not going to college. I'm really sorry. I understand. If it is something that you have already decided, you have my support. He has an expression of internal conflict. Yes...a vocational school is also an option... I don't think going to college is a mistake, And I don't know what the right decision is either, but... I want to follow my dream. I wanted you to know. Because you are special for me. You mean... Of course, I mean that in a weird way. Why did Miku say something like that at that time? I'm sure she wasn't just talking about his school plans. I could tell. Next time it will be your turn. What I have to say is... Welcome brother. What are you doing in my house? Here, Yotsuba said she didn't remember giving you one. Oh, sorry to bother you. The curry is ready. I'll eat a little. Are you okay with that? I already heard about your results. That's why I'm not going to give up on college. I'll leave the school festival if necessary. I'm counting on you, it would be a problem if you didn't come in. Because if you fail, everything I've done so far would be pointless. That is not true. Was the time you spent helping future actress Ichika, and future chef Miku pointless? I don't think so... Our relationship can no longer be classified as teacher and students. Uesugi-kun, even if what the future holds is failure... "If I hadn't gone to that school myself" "If I hadn't met you, I..." I assure you none of us will regret anything. None of this has been in vain... And now, it's my turn. All participants, please meet in the gym. The opening ceremony of the 29th dawn festival is about to start. First we will have our greatest pride, the opening performance of our girls' unit. -Nino is awesome! -He really did... The 29th festival has already started! - They fit you perfectly, Miku! - Who taught you? -Recently in my work.,... -Customers arrived. Thank you for your purchase! I don't know if I can keep my nerves until 3:00 p.m. Well, at this rate I'll be done on time with the inspections. Hey Yotsuba! It's Red! That dance in the opening act was beautiful! -Now I'm your biggest fan! -If you like, you can eat my hotdog. T-Thank you.. I wanted to visit the stalls, but... -Is this common for Ichika? -Nino! It's you Itsuki. That dance was really amazing. It really feels like a festival. We are in the middle of the festival, what are you doing? I'll finish on time, don't worry. I am exhausted. Where will Fuu-kun be? It's over here. Thanks for the guide. You're a good boy. Uesugi-kun, I want to make this place a rest area, any ideas? Oh well... Sorry for the delay. Miku, this way! You are late. Pretty late. Well, now we are all. No. We're still missing one. -Hello! -Ichika! You came! Why didn't you tell us? I guess he didn't want to promise and not deliver. Yes something like that. Now we are all. We meet like this is comforting. It's true. Since we're all here, how about we eat? Bought a lot at the stalls! I've been holding back this whole time! I love all five. That was very sudden. Wh-What do you mean by that?! I would have liked to continue as before, the six of us. But, I think I have to give you an answer. It's alright, Fuutarou. I mean I'm not stupid enough to give an answer in the middle of the festival. I haven't even had time to recover. So just wait until the last day of the festival. Oh come on. It's a bit disappointing. Well I think we should pick up and toast. An orange juice! Do we have matcha? -Of course not. Finally you were able to say it, right? It took you a long time to solve this difficult problem. Don't make fun of me, please. But, I'm also pretty jealous. -For you fuutarou. -Thank you. Well, we must celebrate the great success of this first day of the festival. Cheers! Hello everyone! Welcome to the second day of the festival. Today I'll be doing interviews to some visitor. Are you looking at me, Nakano-san? You remember me, right? I have come to see you. Don't take the microphone away from me! Sorry, it will be another time.. Wait... Alright let's start again. Excuse me miss, why have you come today? Me? I came to see an old friend. There is no work for you today. -What? -Take advantage and enjoy the festival. How can I enjoy the festival if I have no money? Now that I think about it, I could go there... I finally found you. Wow, you've grown up, Fuutarou. Takebayashi? Yes you are bad. Point more to the left. I can't concentrate if you keep talking. I want that. Aim for that one! He told us all that yesterday, and today he's on a date with someone else... Uesugi-san is a bit of a casanova... Follow me Fuutarou. Hey! Would you like some pancakes? Look, they sell pancakes here, Fuutarou Yes, well, this is my class's food stand... -Oh, I see. -Fuu-kun? Thank you for taking care of our Fuutarou. Our? And who are you? Nice to meet you, my name is Takebayashi. I was a classmate in elementary school. Yes? Well, we are also his classmates, but we also have a relationship between tutor and student. It would not be an exaggeration to say that our relationship goes beyond being simple companions. Really? What a coincidence! I also used to teach Fuutarou. It's scary when a problem Nino comes to you for help, right? Actually they are my students. Oh really? So that makes it pretty clear. Now we know who is closest to him. Yotsuba, I no longer... -I am the one who is closest to- -I thank you very much! If what you say is true, then you have helped us indirectly. If it's just about time, then yes, we would lose, But if we talk about the depth of our relationship, then we have no intention of losing. Girls, you're embarrassing me, can you please stop? By the way, Takebayashi, don't bother them too much. They are part of the few friends I have. Each one of them is special to me. You really have matured. My sincere apologies to both of you, can I have a pancake? Yotsuba... Sorry, I have to go back to work. Fuu-kun! My feelings will never change! Welcome, how did it go? Well it seems that Fuutarou is doing well. And the quintuplets seem to be good people. Quintuplets? Good luck, Fuutarou. I don't know if this decision, or the act of making a decision, is the right thing to do or not. Having three days to think about it is not enough time at all. Last festival - Ichika Asashi High School's closing school festival is coming to an end. Last festival - Ichika Asashi High School's closing school festival is coming to an end. First Day of School Festival The taxi is late. I heard that actress Nakano Ichika attends this school. Really? He was amazing in that series, remember? I would like to get a kiss from her, just like in that series. Does it shock you to know that I have kissed? No. I'm an actress, you know? those things happen. -I didn't think about that. -I know. After all, you have experience too, right? H-How do you know that? although that was an accident. Oh...so you really have So who was she with? I-I don't know. They were all dressed as Itsuki. And who do you think she was? Look, your taxi has arrived. Today you really had guts. By the way... maybe she won't be able to come to the festival again. Could I hear your answer right now? If you still have doubts, you do not need to answer me. Okay. I will not choose anyone. That's my answer. You are the worst! Stop sugarcoating your words. you are very cruel Very nice cut! We are left with this shot. Are you okay? Ichika-chan, are you used to this? Another good day at work. I'll go back to the hotel and get some sleep. -Ichika-chan, bad news! -Boss? I got a call, it looks like your sister passed out. I'm glad to see you well. She rests a bit. Nino and Fuutarou-kun. -You also came Ichika. -Yes. I could have called, but I wouldn't feel comfortable. What about the rest? All good, at least they're calm now. We'll be fine, don't worry. I'm glad to hear that. There are still things to clean, I have to go back to school. Fuu-kun, keep Ichika company. Oh yes. Well, I think she should go home. Fuutarou-kun, have you finished your homework yet? -Yes.... -Then how about we walk for a while? Wow, this place is pretty big. -Do you remember this place? -Of course, you mean that festival, right? And yes, this place is quite big with no stalls or people. Well, it's not like we're the only two here. Did you know that many couples are formed in these three days of the festival? And especially the third day. For a moment I thought you would say something like that, since you know a lot about the subject. Do I really look like the type of person who would fall for those kinds of social fads? Oh come on. I know that under that shell, you are someone less reserved. What do you mean? Looking at fancy cars, getting really excited during our trip, screaming on top of the mountains, just to give an example... You seriously have a good memory. Although of course, that's the beauty of you. I've been honest with you, make sure you appreciate it. And don't say you don't choose any. I don't even know what my feelings are. Don't get complicated, it's better not to think about it so much. I mean, we talked about kisses yesterday, right? Nino, Miku, Yotsuba, and even Itsuki-chan. That is the question. Would you be happy with anyone? Just kidding. Look, a vending machine, I'll give you some money, go buy something. Buy what you like. -I'll wait for you on that bench over there. -What happened to you so suddenly? Fuutarou-kun, black tea is Nino, green tea is Miku, juice is Yotsuba, and coffee is Itsuki-chan. That's playing dirty... It was the only way... What will you do, Fuutarou-kun? 10 minutes passed I made her wait a long time... I guess it wasn't a good time. I feel like you're always like this. Being the elders, I guess we've both worked really hard. Huh? You were looking at my lips, right? -Why? -Were you awake...? Why did you see my lips? Because I kissed one of the five of you. There's a chance it's you. Heavens, I suck. Yes, a little. And? it was me? l-lchika... Experiencing it instead of just watching is faster, right? Yes, but why did you do it?! You're an actress and you might be used to it, but I... If you mean the kiss in that series, it was with a girl. huh? Kissing male actors is still something I don't accept for now. So, you are the first... Why not make some memories, since this is something you can't do with a classmate? Oh, I forgot to ask you something. Did that make you happy? What's with that condescending look? And that I said: "I've been honest with you, make sure you appreciate it." That's right, it doesn't matter who Fuutarou-kun chooses. I guess these feelings won't go away for some time. Last festival - Ninos Perspective It's time for the Asashi High School Festival Bonfire Event. Last festival - Ninos Perspective It's time for the Asashi High School Festival Bonfire Event. All scheduled events have ended. First Day of School Festival Well, we must celebrate the great success of this first day of the festival. First Day of School Festival Well, we must celebrate the great success of this first day of the festival. Cheers! Why do you keep wearing that outfit? Because he wanted you to see me wearing it... Nino was amazing, right? Y-Yes. I'm supposed to do the opening ceremony, but Nino did it for me. It's because all you do is smile and accept all the work they give you. You even helped out with the drama club. Stop doing that or you'll collapse. As always, Nino's weakness is her sisters. N-It wasn't the only reason I accepted. I thought by being onstage, I could see the entire audience. What do you mean? We sent an invitation to our father. He was not in the crowd. Although I don't really care, I figured it wouldn't come. I see... Maybe he will come another day. We can take a look at the food stalls. Damn he's not Shall I call you? Huh? Nope... Gosh! He just confessed, how can he be so calm? Let's just talk to him. No. Stop. I'm fine, I never thought he'd come anyway. But you worked up the courage to send her an invitation. Are you seriously going to accept it? I will wait, I will trust him. Second Day of School Festival We have pancakes, very, very fluffy. This way, please. It's only the second day and the pancake stand is selling even more. For some reason it became fashionable. Yeah, we got call from Uesugi-Kun Is this Nino-chan's stall? Hello! Manager, you came! huh? Was she disappointed just now? For a second I thought it was Dad. Everyone, Thank you for your cooperation This wraps up the second day of the Asashi High School Festival! Hey, are we really going to be the top sellers? I can't wait any longer. Nino, come with me. Uesugi-kun. I'm not going, everything is fine. Although Papa read the invitation, he did not come. He doesn't care about us. There is still one day left of the festival, but enough is enough. I'm beginning to regret wishing for something that won't come true. I don't know the history of your family well. All I know is that your relationship with your father is out of the ordinary. But, on the other hand, you know? His wariness of him towards me is quite scary, that must be the warning look of a father. If he didn't feel affection for you, he wouldn't act like that. So I'm going to complain to him that you guys are a nuisance. Hey! Uesugi-kun! I found that person. When I went back to the recordings, I found someone with the description you gave me. Are you enjoying the sunrise festival? Oh, it seems I have an affair I'm sorry, it will be another time No... Is that who you were looking for? Thank you. It seems that he did come. What will you do, Nino? Fuu-kun. Take me to Dad! It's true... Why was he hesitating? Even if stretching and loosening doesn't work. It's more my style to go on the offensive. Good afternoon, I'm here to return the daughter I borrowed. -Why you-? -Go home before dark. Wait. They are almost ready. Please try them, we know you went to school. Did you say pancakes? Well, they're pretty cheap, and my daughters love them. I wanted to make them for them one last time... It won't be the last time. Nakano-kun, I have no way to thank you. But don't waste any more time on someone like me who doesn't have long to live. That he doesn't have much time to live? Do not say that. It is because for me she is an important teacher. Rena-sensei. A teacher, huh? How many years have passed? If you leave, your daughters will be sad. It's true. Leaving those girls alone is my only regret. They still feel so small. Seeing them grow is my only purpose. Thank you very much, Nakano-kun. I'll be in your care a little longer. When I'm discharged, let me make you some pancakes. I think you will like them too. Miku made the dough. The same Miku who was bad at cooking. She found a goal and is working hard for it. And not just Miku. The five of us have grown a lot since that time. I want you to see up close how we grow Dad. He is eating! Huh? but... What is that expression? This flavor... I see you girls have faced it instead of running away. huh? What do you...? But, in any case, this is a lot. It is not an amount that I can eat by myself. Next time, let's eat together as a family. What is all this about?! But I'm sure everyone will be happy about it... Very good. Well, I'll go to the bathroom. Uesugi-kun, wait a minute. Was this your idea? It was not. Yes it was. He brought me here. I wonder if that's appropriate. I think it goes beyond the responsibilities of a tutor, don't you think? But that's not something I could have done. So I'm glad I gave you that job. Although I am not a good father, I ask you to think seriously about your relationship with my daughters. Fuu-kun, thank you for today. And also for everything until now. B-By the way about tomorrow- Watch out! It was close What are you two doing? S-She slipped, that was it! So close... Yes, that would be the best. Now that was close. Are you okay Nino? In love, you really have to be on the offensive. What just happened? Hey dad. Just I wanted to say... No matter how our sisterly relationship changes, my feelings won't change. Thank you for choosing Fuu-kun as our tutor! Last festival - Mikus perspective The Asashi High School Holiday Closing Party is about to end. Last festival - Mikus perspective The Asashi High School Holiday Closing Party is about to end. This is the last scheduled event. First Day of School Festival Aren't those the boys in our class? First Day of School Festival Aren't those the boys in our class? They must be spying on the competition. We can't lose against the boys and their Takoyaki! Let's try harder, Miku-chan! Th-Um... the boys in our class... Let's stop being so stubborn and make up! Working together will be more fun! It's something I wish I could say if I had the courage... Nothing. I'll go look this way. Uesugi-kun. huh? Talk to men. Tell them to stop being so stubborn. Stop that already, and make peace. Th-This... This time, I'll do the opposite and spy on them. That is ok? We're not going to lose to those damn girls! Yes! What do we do? The only one who can change this, It's you, Miku. The fact that you are the advisor to the enemy group means that you could change how they feel. Well, that's what my gut tells me anyway. Fine, I'll believe in you, Fuutarou. Hello! Nakano-Sa...NAKANO What does the leader of the pancake faction want with us? An order of Takoyaki, please. It looks delicious. Bon appetit. It's hot, be careful. Thank you. Rich. I want the other girls in the class to try it too. When the first day is over, I'll bring the girls. I'm sure your determination will get to you! Even if you say that out of the blue. They said Takoyaki was a shame, you know? Why should we do something for them? Why don't I admit it? Fuutarou, wait. Believe... I have to say it. I'm sorry to say this now. But I'm sure the feeling of waiting for things to end like this is mutual. Let's work together so that later we can say: "it was a nice school festival we had" Come to think of it, you let Matsui-san have a drink, right Maeda-kun? Hey, I told you not to say it...! What does this mean, Maeda? Did you try sneaking out on your own?! Although I wanted Maruyama-san to have some too! Then Yuri-chan is for me! Well... It's not like there isn't someone I want to give some to. Nakano-san, could you do that for the sake of these guys? Yes! Of course! Thank you. This was thanks to you, Fuutarou. Huh? I didn't do anything, you know. You were the one who gave everyone a push. You've become very trustworthy, Miku. Hey, this stall was the Takoyaki stall, right? Stay back from the stall Miku! I found out where Uesugi-san is. as i thought, he is outside And he's talking to a girl I don't recognize! Who is it? No? Did... I mean, didn't Uesugi-san tell us yesterday that he loves the five of us? Let's believe in it! believe. When we met him, they told me. Why do you try so hard to believe in what I love? No matter what happens, because I love Fuutarou. Because I love Fuutarou, I believed in him and I was able to get here. Miku? I didn't see you all day. Fuutaro, come with me. The rooftop. But isn't he off limits to the school? Yeah, imagine we wouldn't bother anyone up here. End this! I bet you were dying laughing that we can't have a position anymore! Like I said, no one has said that! You guys are the only ones who messed up for causing the accident! What did you say?! What's your problem?! Did you call them up here? It's true that they couldn't bother anyone else up here. It's not that. The cause of the disturbance is me. -Nakano-san. -Miku-chan, what's with this lett-? With this.... I Finish! Already! With this! How long will they remain stubborn? They are high school students! Next year it will be university students! Aren't you ashamed to argue like children? There isn't even one better and one worse between pancakes and Takoyaki! That's true for boys and girls too! They are both doing their best! Why can't they see that?! Since we prepared for the festival, it hasn't been fun if not awkward. I've been holding on all this time! But I've had enough! Miku... You... Everyone was already tired before today. The boys go to help behind the scenes for the pancake stand. But... Even if I agree with that, what about the others? Leave it to me. I will convince them. Believe in me. I'm sorry. I had given up. I thought that repairing the crack was impossible. I ended up limiting myself. Miku? Who was that girl? Girl? The one in the shooting gallery! Ah, she is a childhood friend. Do you love her?! Like a woman?! She is only a friend. I see. Then it's okay! I've been holding back from asking that. So you were holding back. You don't have to be secretive about that kind of thing. Okay, got it. Then... kiss me I said you don't have to be so secretive, but... How did that come out of the conversation? Sorry, I'll hear your answer later. No matter what kind of insurmountable obstacle I encounter, As long as she believes in myself, I can go as far as she wants. I will hesitate no more. Last festival - Yotsubas perspective Asashi High School's school holiday party is almost over. Last festival - Yotsubas perspective Asashi High School's school holiday party is almost over. This is the last scheduled event. First Day of School Festival Thank you very much! Damn. She is the emerald queen! She's as far as you'll go, heroes! It would be a shame if they both died here. So give up and become my servants! For a while I didn't know what was going to happen, but... I'm so glad I asked you for help, senpai... I say the same, I am very happy to have you. I come to inspect. Good job. Ingredients appear to be fresh. Oh, having paper trash lying around is a potential threat, make sure to clean up. Alright this should be the last inspection! Come try the Karaage. Good job as a promoter. Take one of our gift vouchers. Yup! I wanted to eat something! I'm... at my limit... You have worked very hard, haven't you? Yotsuba. Uesugi-san, you're a bit of a wimp, so get some rest. Sorry, I'm fine now. So let me continue, I want to finish before 3:00. I'm worried about you! And I won't move until you do what I tell you! Oh, now that I remember I haven't eaten anything since breakfast. But there are tons of stalls! I'm sure it's because you don't have any money. I'll give you this! Make sure you eat! Hmm... Are you sure? Yes! I have a full belly so- I have a full belly so that's fine. Come on, it's time to move some things! Yotsuba, thank you. I'm glad to have you around. What are you saying? It is natural that we help each other. I should be the one to say that. Just hearing that you recognize me makes it all worth it. There are only two days left until Uesugi-san gives us his answer. The same applies to the days that we can continue to spend it like this... But... what if he chooses me? Damn. But why do we have to suspend operations? Even though we did all of that just for today... we just have to accept it. We were warned that it was dangerous, right? Damn! More work please. Need help with something? There you are. You're Fuutarou's friend, right? uh... Am I at school? You are in the hospital. I was really scared when I heard you were here. I see. Sorry for making you worry. I need to go back. There are still things I have to take care of. -If I don't hurry up, the drama club will be in trouble. -Wait.. Yotsuba, it's already late. The second day is over. In Kyoto, six years ago. Was it you that Fuutarou met? How? How? He kept showing me that picture over and over again. I talked to your sisters at the pancake stand and found out you were alone. As expected of Uesugi-san's tutor.. I am very happy to meet you. -Futarou knows what-? -Please don't tell him! Why? I don't want to disappoint him. While he worked giving his best effort, I was doing pointless things and wasting time for the last 5 years. I am not capable of being useful to anyone. All I do is cause trouble. Is that the only reason? I know someone who said the same thing, saying that he was an unnecessary person. And that person is now starting to walk forward. I pray that you too can free yourself from your past Oh, you woke up. Uesugi-san... Please let me in. I have to go... Go do what? They all went home. In that case, then I'll go apologize to everyone! It's not just the drama club, I also took on the tasks of many others... It causes problems for everyone... What am I going to tell them? Still, I won't let you pass. You're supposed to be resting until tomorrow. And I have no intention of moving from here. For now let's sit and talk about what happened at the school festival after you left. So far they came, heroes! I know her! She's the former captain of the track team, right? Yes. Although she hardly had time to prepare, she acted quite well, didn't she? But, the suit was made to my measurements... Do you remember these two? They are from the sewing club.... Did they adjust it for her? It's my fault that... Each and every one of them. Do you realize? These are people you have helped. They all came to help. They all came to help. "It's natural to help each other", right? It's okay that you're the one who should get help from time to time. I am one of the people you have helped. Uesugi-san, I'm really sorry to bother you with this, but... On the last day, please take care of my work. Yes, leave it to me. Third day of the festival Uesugi Fuutarou-kun. It's been a while, Renee. A lot of things happened today and I'm tired. Please come back later. Thank you for remembering our promise all this time. But I couldn't fulfill it. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. Wouldn't you mind fuutarou-kun? Well... The present is more important than the past, right? I will no longer depend on those memories we shared. I am going to discover my value for myself. So this will be the last time. What an embarrassing dream. It must be because of the whole school festival thing. I did something very daring. He will forgive me, right? I just wanted to make one last memory. This is not the time to continue to be burdened by the past. With this, I feel like I can keep moving forward. Yes, with this... Me too... Last festival - Itsukis perspective Asashi High School's closing party is about to end. Last festival - Itsukis perspective Asashi High School's closing party is about to end. This is the last scheduled event. First Day of School Festival You are... Thank you very much for his help, Mudou-sensei. How applied you are, you are studying in the middle of the festival. Well yes.. I am going to become a teacher. I want to follow my mom's raisins. Oh, my mom was a teacher. I know. Huh? I was her teacher. You are the spitting image of your mother when she was young. The living image. Yes, to a twisted point. If you're just following in your mother's footsteps, I don't recommend it. Your distorted devotion will lead you to ruin. my life... It was full of errors. You have unconsciously convinced yourself of this. That is a curse. Onii-chan, is it true about the burning stall? Yes... No one was injured by the fire. I'm glad to hear that. By the way Fuutarou, ? Did you see a weird old man at the festival? huh? It's true! Dad spent the whole day talking about it. Well, it's okay if he didn't see it. He must have a fairly long beard. An old man who would still look like one even if you turned his head away? So he came. Who the hell is that old man? Maybe it's better if I tell you this. That man is... Need something? Hearing all this out of the blue and from a complete stranger must have been confusing. Your mother was my student. She was also my co-worker, She was my wife. In other words, I am... your father. Dad? All this time I've wanted to see them. You girls, you were always on my mind While I was traveling around the country giving classes. Then I saw Ichika-chan on tv. -It's time for me to do my duty as your da- -What are you talking about?! Mom told me all about you. You disappeared when you found out she was expecting quintuplets. Can you imagine how mom felt at that moment?! -When -Forgive me! I was so pathetic! If I had been more trustworthy at that time, you would not have gone through so many difficulties. Please don't get involved with us anymore. We already have a father. Nakano-kun, right? What did he do for you when your mother died? He allowed my daughter to chase the shadow of her dead mother. You are about to go down the same wrong path your mother took. You should know better than anyone that you're not cut out to be a teacher. As your father, it's not something I can ignore! My love for you compels me to take action! Itsuki-chan? This... How to say it...? Was she different? I haven't seen her since yesterday, I couldn't tell you... Why do you ask? I suspect that her biological father contacted Itsuki. It can't be... Why? Itsuki? She didn't come today. I wonder what happened to her. She has been locked in her room. I see. Wait. You're going to go see Itsuki, right? take this away Are you sure? This is what defines you and it's what I like about you. Leave the rest to us. Go take care of Itsuki. Uesugi-kun... Even though I was told that what I do is useless, I wonder why I keep doing it. If you talk about that old man, don't worry about him. I bet he just said nonsense. My mom said it too. Itsuki, make sure you don't become like me. But still I can't give up. I still want to be like mom. Is it wrong for me to want that?! She had a point... Nothing good comes out of being a teacher. Nothing guarantees that you will only have good students. You will learn in this world there are idiots who are beyond your imagination. You will be forced to betray your own principles to get along with them. Without a doubt, getting involved with others is very tiring, both physically and mentally. And maybe you'll get some rebellious students. But still, you must face it, not run away. It's quite a hassle. I've had enough of that. You definitely don't want to become a teacher. But so what? There is no point in listening to the nonsense that others say. This is your dream, right? No matter what kind of things you face, you decide whether to give up or move on! But... is it really my dream? I just want to be like my mom. Someone had already told me. to be like your mother and follow in your mother's footsteps because you aim to fulfill your dream. As long as you understand that, aspiring to be like her is not a mistake. I want to be a teacher just like her! I aim to be like mom by my own free will! If that's what my student wants, then there's only one thing I can do as a tutor. Support her with all my might. Uesugi-kun I have a great idea. Please teach me. Of course. Thank you very much. But before that, there is something I have to do. Good afternoon, Mudou-sensei. Oh. I didn't expect you to come see me, Itsuki-chan. Can I take this to mean that you decided to listen to what I have to say? Father?! That is hilarious! You... What's up? It's been a while, sensei. That said, the one who has business with you is not us. Mudou-sensei. It looks good. Nakano-kun... Come to think of it, I remember you admired Rena more than anyone. My apologies. No, I am grateful. Her irresponsible acts of hers brought my daughters and me together. Is that true? From my point of view, you weren't fulfilling your responsibilities either. That's why Itsuki-chan came to me. She did not go with you, whom she can trust, but with me. Itsuki-kun... Is she here? What are you saying? Look closely. Itsuki-kun is not here. I'm over here. What does this mean? I apologize for misleading you. But with this I was able to understand something. What? I just got confused. One can differentiate us as long as there is love. It's what mom used to say. Are you still talking about that woman? Stop using those empty words! How much longer will you continue to believe in them? Forget that nonsense! Your mother must have mentioned something about it too! Go ahead, remember what your mother told you. I remember mom talking about her regrets. That's right! Your mother was definitely wrong! I don't think that's true. Even if mom in vengeance rejected her own life, I simply reject her rejection. I say this because I watched it very carefully. the silhouette of my mother. Who left everything aside to dedicate himself completely to us. What you believe is irrelevant! You keep talking like you know everything. You don't know hers. hope these girls brought him after that. You have no right to say anything about her. Dad. Mudou-sensei, In the end, you never said a single word of apology to my mother. I will never forgive you. I will not be something to ease your conscience! I doubt that the day will come when you will be absolved of your sins towards my mother. You don't know what you say. You're just embarrassing yourself, man. Blee! hey! So, were you able to finish everything? Knowing you, you were watching from afar, right? Who knows? Thank you very much, Uesugi-kun. Since Mom left, trying to take her place has been my way of burying my loneliness. At some point, the bond between my mother and I became blurred. To the point that even I didn't feel sure of my own dream. It's okay if I don't forget about mom, right? You are the one who taught me that. Thank you very much. Oh wow. The sky has darkened without realizing it. It's already winter, right? What is happening to you? That was scary. I have my reasons, sorry. Leaving that aside, it's thanks to you that I have more confidence in myself. I'm not a mom. I could realize it, because you were there. Mom is still my ideal teacher, but... what? W-Well What I want to say. Uesugi-kun, you are also my ideal! I just wanted to tell you that. Now we will announce the prize for the best position of the festival. We did it! We did it! This... Where will Nakano-san be? Sorry for the wait. How was it, Itsuki? Were you able to deliver the message to Fuutarou-kun? Yes. Also, I thanked him for the incident with our biological father. And I also want to thank all of you. Neglect. Anyway Jera a whole family affair. But... Th-! Thank you! That felt really weird. It can't be... You girls too?! Oh, and Miku, you went as far as to disguise yourself. Don't even mention it. Also, I was not satisfied with such a careless costume. This girl is proud of something quite strange. I think changing that much would make any normal person feel weird. Although the person inside is different, our faces are identical. I wonder how much longer we'll be quintuplets. Anyway, since there's some time left before we leave with Fuutarou-kun. Let's stop thinking about it and enjoy the party! It feels a bit melancholic to know that this is about to end. But I enjoyed it to the fullest, how about you? Kind of, I guess... What have I been up to during my last school festival? I'm not sure. I have done nothing but help here and there. I see. Even Ichika was with them, so the five of them were together. huh? I'm impressed that you could recognize Ichika-san from just that glance. Huh?! W-Well... It might sound weird, but I've sort of come to distinguish Ichika-san from the others. I'm sure Uesugi-kun can tell all of them apart, right? I think I can... But I never have. It was much more confusing at first, Mostly because I've never been good at remembering faces. And on top of that, they used that to their advantage. I can't count how many times I've been cheated on. They are a nuisance from start to finish. Look who's talking. Now I am curious to know... who did you end up being able to distinguish from them. Very well, let's go to the stalls. Wait a minute. What was that pause just now? What's going on? Let's ask Uesugi-kun. What's going on? Nothing happens! Come on, don't be so distant. How cold of you not to tell your secrets to your friends! shut up I have nothing more to tell you! Are you in love with one of the quintuplets? With the exam just around the corner, do you think now is a good time for something like this? But, it is not necessary to put everything else aside, Whether it's studying, friendship, work, play or romance, they have always given their all. They were the ones who taught someone as stubborn and rigid as me that. It took me a long time to realize something so simple. If I was still the old me, you'll probably be alone right now. Uesugi. Very good! Let's go to the stalls! Although I have no money. If you don't have money, then why do you go to the stalls? -This rest area saved my life. -Right? Obviously, is to enjoy until the last minute. It will soon be time. Uesugi, everything will be decided today. This is something we discussed and decided together. Just wait. You will only go to one room. We know that this suggestion may put you in a difficult position. But this is the degree of our determination. I hope you understand. Asashi High School's closing party is about to end. This is the last scheduled event. Uesugi-kun. Well done, Fuutarou-kun. It's over. You had already decided since then, hadn't you? This is just the beginning. Uesugi-kun. There it is. Hey, sorry for making you wait. Huh...? What are you doing here Uesugi-san? I came to see you, Yotsuba. It's a joke, right? You must be kidding! That can't be happening! I had a feeling you would react like that. In fact, I was the one who was waiting for a while! Why weren't you here? I mean... There wasn't the slightest chance that you- I even went out and bought this while it was still fresh. That's... You gave me a voucher, remember? Here, eat. Did you keep it all this time? Yes. I made it so I could eat it here with you. Now... By the way, there's something I want to ask you now that you know my answer. You who-? Sorry! Uesugi-san? Hey. Uesugi-san. It took all that courage to come, I can't believe I was instantly rejected. Um... the fact that Uesugi-san feels that way about me is a great honor, but... There must be a much better option for you, Uesugi-san! It would be a waste for you to settle for someone like me! What do you mean? L-Look, instead of me, anyone... Anyone? I'm asking you right now. Tell me what you feel. Damn! I won't let you get away! Uesugi-kun. Itsuki. How is everyone? If you're looking for Yotsuba, I saw her running over there. There's only one place she could be going. Consideration would only add insult to injury. You are right. I'm sorry. Yotsuba, you've always been saying that, haven't you? Over and over. Let's have a field trip with no regrets! Let's have a school trip with no regrets! Let's have a school festival with no regrets! I won't give up! Oh! Wait! I'm so sorry Uesugi-san, I'm not a good person. If I hadn't... Girls, where did you go? It hurts. I am sorry. No, same thing, sorry. Oh, it's late. Let's go wait for the bus. I may have spent all my money buying those charms. Fool! For your information, I only have this 200 yen coin. I'm not going to lend it to you. Okay, I get it. So be careful. Oh, it disappeared. We are so poor that we usually only throw away 5 yen. How stingy, right? Fuutarou-kun... Doesn't it bother you to be poor? What do you mean? For me it is the same. Mom works very hard on her own, for us. Do you know? I don't mind. But I feel bad seeing mom like this. But, I'm going to study very hard, I'm going to get smart. I'll find a job that pays a lot of money and make things easier for mom! So, there will definitely be a reason for her to be by her side. Whoops. You are like an adult. You're right! I'm going to stop making excuses! I'm going to change everything, changing myself! I have a younger sister. Although she is still in elementary school. If I study very hard I will become super smart. Let's work very hard together! I do it for my mom, and Fuutarou-kun for his sister. Let's study with everything we have! Yes! By the way, I didn't make a wish for that 200 yen. Let's each make a wish.﻿ Wait! Yotsuba. That ribbon looks good on you. Thanks, now they won't confuse us Do you think so? What you wear makes no difference. Not only that! I've studied harder than the others, and I was first place last time. I am winning. I am no longer in the same place as the others. We are not the same. Mom! Mom! Look! Look! Oh how cute. I tried to copy Yotsuba and put this in my hair. Yotsuba, the effort you put in is excellent, and there's nothing wrong with it. But no matter who comes first, you are all special in your own way. As your mother, I hope you stay together. No matter what happens... The important thing is not where they are, but that the five are still united. I knew it. It hadn't improved. Now he is no longer with us. With permission. This is the first time I speak to all of you. They must have seen me a few times. Mom, we're in high school now. But, we can't be together. We can no longer be united. Dad, check this out! I got the best grade out of the five in the last exam! Good job. The track team also tried to recruit me but I turned them down! They had no other choice, since I want to focus on my studies. Continue, being so applied. Hmm... He's a bit cold. Mom would have congratulated me more. She would have, right? I wonder if Fuutarou-kun is studying now... Are you not going to play them anymore, Yotsuba? Yes! They get in the way of my studies. Then maybe I'll borrow them. Very good, constantly improving. From now on I will work even harder! Yotsuba! This is the first time I've gotten such a grade on a history test! It's all thanks to the game you lent me. I-I see. How good. I need to work harder! I'm going to study a lot. Get smarter. Join a company that pays a lot... And what is it that I study for? The important thing is not where they are, but that the five remain united. Why is it important that the five of us are together? I don't get it... Members of the track team, please come up on stage. Congratulations on advancing to Nationals. Mom, are you looking at me? Everyone praises me. Many people depend on me. Not from my sisters, but from me! You have been practicing a lot lately, have you studied properly? If you want, I can teach you. Now I am different from you. Don't group me with you. I'm number one! I am special! You flunked again. Nakano Yotsuba-san, you are expelled. huh? what? It's a joke, right? No. But I have given very good results in club activities! Recently, I went to nationals with the basketball team. That is not relevant. I warned you several times, but you did not stop being in multiple clubs. Please collect your belongings Hey? Transfer? I have an acquaintance who is the director of an educational institution. You will start going there when the summer holidays are over. Only me? huh? But it was supposed to be special. I have worked hard to give meaning to my existence, but... Why am I alone? If I end up alone, then what do I do? What must I do to become special? I don't know how to go on. Wait! If Yotsuba will be transferred. Then we will go too. What are you girls saying? You passed the exam! Yes, we did. Thanks to us cheating. I-Is that true?! Us too. Girls, why? Why are you doing this for me? Yotsuba, I don't know what's going through your head, but... I'd hate it if you left. No matter where you go, we will go with you. Because that's what mom taught us. Yotsuba, no matter what happens, we will divide it into five equal parts. The five of us can overcome any adversity together. So this is what mom meant. I'm going to stop thinking about who's better. I will live for the well-being of all. 100 points! Wait! If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be here. I must erase these feelings. Are you okay? All your sisters are good people. Amazing, I really like them. And I'm proud to have tutored her. But if you hadn't been there, I would have given up long ago. Why are you telling me something like that? I'm a weak person, I'm sure I'll keep bumping into obstacles on my way. This is the selfish request of a pathetic man. During those times, Yotsuba. It would make me really happy to have you by my side. Don't worry. Just as you have supported me, I want to support you too. That's why... Please tell me how you feel. Uesugi-san, I... Say it, then it's all over. I hate you Uesugi-san! I hate you! Hate you! Hate you! Love you. Already... I can't lie to you, Uesugi-san. I have always loved you. But I'm sorry. There is still something left to do. Huh? So You're not dating? Not exactly. I see. I see, so they're not dating. If that's true, then Fuutarou-kun doesn't belong to anyone yet? Come on, cheer up! You said you love Yotsuba, right? That means his feelings are mutual! He'll start to hate you if you keep grieving over things like that! You are right. Thank you, Ichika. If one day he were to choose you, I would have congratulated you! Now I understand what you meant, Nino. You always knew how I feel about Fuu-kun. Yesterday you went to your room being aware of it, right? I don't want to hear you say you care about me now. Of course I care about you, you are my precious family. In that case, our relationship ends here If our relationship continues like this I'd rather cut our ties as sisters. Yotsuba. You'll freeze if you stay here too long. Miku.. I am Yotsuba. I am Yotsuba. What the heck? I thought of a plan. Since I'm not the chosen one. I will transform into you and I'll go out with fuutarou. What do you think? I don't think that's correct. Not ethically. I'm cold... Let's go somewhere else. It is the first time that the two of us are alone in a karaoke. yotsuba, Wh-what? It was just a joke. Turning into you was a joke. Even if I could imitate you, I could never be you. This juice is too sweet for me. Miku. But, I am angry. If I were you, I wouldn't do anything to make Fuutarou worry. How hesitant you are about answering him. Even though, from my point of view you are very fond of Fuutarou. I am not undecided. My feelings are the same for a long time. My feelings for Uesugi-san have never changed. I never thought the day would come when I would hear you say those words so clearly. But if that's true, you shouldn't hesitate now. Don't worry about us. Just go ahead and start dating him. Did you think he would say something like that? I feel that this is the case, But he doesn't make it any less frustrating. But I just can't calm my emotions. That's how serious I am. Yotsuba, if you feel the same way, I want you to accept our feelings too. I couldn't understand Nino's feelings. Of course she would be mad at me. But I can't calm my emotions. Nino had already said it. When it comes to love, we are neither friends nor enemies. I see, if you are capable of thinking like that, As a show of resistance, I definitely will not give you my support. While we're at it, let's sing something. Yes! Listen well. Because I'm definitely going to sing better than you. I expect no less. Gosh, look! The weather has improved a lot! Singing all night took a toll on our voice. Tell me, Miku. I... I want to see them all. Yotsuba has a wrong idea about one thing. But it's something I won't tell you. I was able to meet Fuutarou because we chose to come to this school. I don't consider that an unfortunate thing. Because I met Fuutarou, I... Let's go, Yotsuba. I couldn't become like Yotsuba, but Yotsuba can't become like me either. I am finally able to... I like him enough to think like that. Itsuki. Can you come for a moment? What's up? There is something I have to tell you. But not here. So, let's go here. Er... What do you want to talk about? I-I'm sorry. Don't worry. I have been feeling this discomfort all this time. Looks like this room is vacant. The first to break the harmony between the quintuplets... It was you, Yotsuba. Sorry for being so selfish. I even told them my feelings without considering how they felt. But still, I still feel the same. My wish. I'm shocked, to think that you would keep saying naive things. Why should I recognise? -Oh, it was just a mouse. -Just a mouse, right? That was close. And now what? There is nothing we can do? Please don't get too close. I can't let them see me like this. We're almost done with lunch, let's go. Wait! What's wrong with you?! I think this is something that concerns us. I have come to tell you to acknowledge my relationship with Uesugi-san. Like I said, that's- But it doesn't have to be right now. It could be in months or years. I don't know how long it takes. But I want you to see for yourselves, how much I love Uesugi-san. How strong are my feelings, because I'm definitely not going to lose. Yes, the way you are now, no matter how much you apologize or try to persuade me, you probably can't convince me. So, do you intend to endure this steep path despite that? I will do it because I love Uesugi-san as much as all my sisters. You really are a fool. But so are you. When I saw you from behind, while you advanced and freed yourself of our shackled quintuplets, I didn't like her and was jealous. I wonder if you still see me as a rival. Of course! We will always live our lives being aware of each other. Sometimes as friends and sometimes as enemies. or something like that. Like a rival, right? This battle is not over! I'll be watching them closely where they're headed. And if I see even the slightest chance, I'll come in and steal it from you! Come out, curious mice. Did you notice? This... you'll see... How long have you been there? Don't tell me you heard everything. I'm sorry. You heard me, right? Fuu-kun. That's the way it is. Be careful not to let your guard down. I'll keep it in mind. You've been messing with some very troublesome sisters, haven't you? but, now I can finally say it. You are not the only one. Uesugi-kun, congratulations. Thank you very much for your invitation today. Sorry for taking your day off. N-Not so. I'm delighted. I see. For one reason or another, we just couldn't find time together at school... That's true. You never know who might be listening. Shouldn't this be the other way around? Really? Go ahead and order whatever you want, however you want! It's my treat! It's a relief. How irritating. Why would you go to a family restaurant on a date? I think it's cute. I'll use this please. You are using a coupon. Doesn't miss a beat. It's ugly to use coupons on a date. This is already quite an achievement for Futarou-kun. You have a recommendation from a sports college, right? Yes! So you have a dream? Do you dream of being an athlete in any sport? I don't think so, and if I had any I should have to be something that I have already forgotten. I think I'm more suited to doing something where I help others after all. I started doing that because I had given up, but now I realized that I can be proud. I see, that's pretty close to you. I came to think that way because that's how you are, Uesugi-san. Is that so? That's right! Therefore, if I am accepted at the university, I will study to know what kind of work I can do. I-I see. I can't with this! Calm down. take it easy. Sorry about that. Okay! Because no matter what it is, it will be the most fun in the world if it's with you. So would it be okay if we go to one last place? Yes! Looks like you don't need a push from us anymore, Yotsuba. This is... This brings back memories. I remember you liked these old swing sets. I thought you were going to take me to places that are special to you today. Yes. We went to that restaurant as a family from time to time. I often studied in that library. Since that day, this place became special to me. Is this really okay? To tell the truth, I'm still doubtful. Is it okay for me to be the only one who's happy? Seriously, is this the right way to go? Hey, you were able to jump pretty far from here, right? Let me see you do it again. Hey, very good. It's pretty easy. Here I come! How are you? Yotsuba. If I can get to where you are, there's something I'd like to tell you. huh? That's it... Here I come! Please don't pressure yourself! Just watch. More... I should be able to do more! He is dead. Yotsuba. Maybe he's an inexperienced person who can't even make a simple date go well. But, I am going to dedicate myself to becoming a man who can stand by your side. No matter which way is right or wrong, Let's walk it together. For that. if you don't mind to be with someone like me. I love you! Please marry me! You surprised me! I... I think you skipped too many steps! Y-You're right. I went ahead. If you tell someone even before they're dating, you'll scare them away! I mean if that girl is not me. I'm sorry. Then please pretend you didn't hear that. huh? yotsuba? I just remembered my dream when I was little. That cliché that everyone wanted to be. A bride, I mean. It's a promise, Uesugi-san! Someday for sure make my dream come true. There is something I have to tell everyone. All this time I didn't have a chance. I have not been able to tell you which university I applied to. It's to Tokyo University! Huh? We already knew that. Huh? Even if you didn't tell us anything... We figured that's what you'd do, Fuu-kun. Yes. It doesn't bother us in the least. Oh... Really? Just push yourself. I'll come visit you whenever I feel like it. Yes, thank you very much. I am grateful to have met them. See you! Yes, see you. It was just as we imagined. I think he looked a little sad saying it and maybe a little happy. We're lucky to see Uesugi-san make a face like that. Silly, didn't we say we weren't going to cry? You are crying too. Dreams and goals, do you think I can be like you girls too? If it's you, Nino, I'm sure you can... Guess I'll let them have a little more of my time. I see, I'm counting on you. Nakano-san, on stage. Thank you. Mom...I...I made it... Hey Yotsuba. Are you sure you're not overdoing it? Heh, you worry too much, Ichika. I'll be fine I mean, as long as we're together. Are you feeling nervous? Maybe. But I am not alone. I'm sure they feel the same way. Ichika says that he is about to arrive. Then we must get ready. It's been a long time since the five of us met. This country is business as usual. Japan, I'm back. You just went on vacation. Hello Itsuki-chan. Thanks for coming to pick me up. You are very famous! Don't talk so loud. welcome- Oh, it's you. Long time no see, Ichika. I'm glad to see you're both doing well. I see you have a very lively cafeteria. Looks like someone picked up a sarcastic sense of humor in America. How was it in the United States? Let's just say, I'm not ready to be hospitalized yet. It says: "international". Don't be so strict. Well, I am a Master after all. Eat before it gets cold. Yes! Although I don't know if I'm up to the task of someone who's used to fancy American cafes. huh? Did you know it wasn't my first time in America? Nino knows this because he is always looking at your Instagram. Miku! You didn't have to tell them that! I know, I'll make a post about your place, as a thank you. Wait. If you do, more customers will definitely come. That would make me very happy, but for now don't do it. Lately we have had more regular customers. Dad let us use this place and all the equipment, therefore, I want to rely on our efforts alone for at least a little longer. What...? I am so proud of you! I wouldn't mind showing you to everyone! If you don't make it, I guess I can let you lock in here. -On the other hand she's not that cute. -That makes her adorable in her own way. Girls, the star of the night has arrived. hello! Looks like they've all arrived! Why are you so sweaty? I was feeling a little nervous, so I came here by bike. Did you come by bike...? What were you thinking? Today is a very important day. Guess Uesugi-kun, I'm taking the train. Yes, Fuutarou arrived since yesterday, he's probably still asleep. huh? What's up? I guess all that remains is to do what we came to do, right? That is why we quote it early. My driver said what's already on the way. Will we really do it? Why do you hesitate now? Weren't you very excited just now? After all, we have to evaluate Uesugi-kun. Ichika. Yes, I have it here. This is our gift for your wedding. Mom's earrings. Yotsuba, are you ready? Yes, I am. All right, let's do it together. Here we go! Yotsuba! Congratulations on your wedding! It hurts! Mr. Groom, the father of the bride has arrived. That's good news, I wasn't sure if he would come or not. I wonder why he didn't come to the ceremony. Apologies, I was still deciding whether I should come or not. Dad! There's no reason for you to call me "Dad". Thank you very much for coming! I never thought he would come to see me... Uesugi-kun, let me cut to the chase. Y-Yes. Will you say that Yotsuba is happy from the bottom of his heart? Yes, and I feel the same way. I'll have some wine. Yes, go ahead. Uh, let's see... Fuutarou's room is... My mother died more than ten years ago. The accident was just after he had achieved his dream of opening his own restaurant. We are left with nothing but a huge debt for the loan to start the business. Maybe one of the reasons my dad let them use the place was that he wanted to help them, and the other reason was to carry on my mother's dream. Someone who is so dedicated to loving a woman his whole life. That's the kind of man I want to be. Just like the two parents I know. Enough. Oh sorry. I'm not used to it. I mean call me father. Mr. Groom? The bride requests your presence. -W-Well. -Go ahead. Damn, Marou. We're really old, aren't we? Didn't you say you only drink to celebrate special occasions? That's right. That's why I'm drinking. Do you think things are going well for them? That's not something a parent can say. However, I know that things will not be that easy. After all, he is marrying my daughter. Fuutarou... this is... the final game... of the quintuplets. As long as there is love... You can tell us apart, right? Thank you very much for making a space for us in your busy schedules to join us today at our wedding reception A game of The Quintuplets..? Are you idiots?! And the other four that aren't Yotsuba! Don't wear wedding dresses just for a stupid game! Do they understand what they are doing? -I admit it's a bit complicated. It's just something that occurred to us. And we are not playing. Because we are the bride's family. Of course, that was a lie. Because I am the real bride. Nope, it's me. If you're looking for the bride, that's me! Surely you can tell who is the real one, right? My gosh, they're dumb. I thought they might have matured a bit, but I'm glad they're still business as usual. Don't underestimate me. I am grateful to all my family. If it weren't for my father, my mother and my sisters, this would not be possible. I'm so glad you became my father. You are lchika. The older sister, Ichika, who had a strong sense of individuality and guided us along the way. As you know, she is a popular actress, and someone I admire a lot. Gosh, you really surprised Onee-san. This reminds me. You've always caused me a lot of trouble. The world looks up to you as a beauty, but you can't fool me. I know you really are a sloppy, lazy, good-for-nothing. N-You don't have to go on... And yet, to see how you always try to be better is something dazzling. Yes... Next You Nino The second sister, Nino, has an explosive temper. But she is strong and strict, always supporting us at every moment. She overflows with femininity, that's something I've always wanted to learn from her. That's right, you got it right! Good for you. Why are you doing this? You could have just pointed at Yotsuba. Your tough exterior hides your fragility. And your toughness is probably because of the depth of love you possess. The me back then was not able to find an answer to give you. I'm sorry. It's okay. I have no regrets. I see. -You're Miku. -Yes. The third sister, Miku, as weird as she seems, I don't feel like an older sister. I feel more like a friend who treats me like an equal. That's why I have great respect that she fulfilled her dream. Sometimes I feel uneasy about whether I'm really doing things right or not. You don't need me to know the answer. You are always fighting with those concerns inside of you. And the war trophies you earn by beating them are entirely yours. Believe in yourself! You have always been very capable. I knew you would say that. Thank you, Fuutarou. Only you remain. Itsuki. But I am Yotsuba. Just kidding. Ta-da! Here's Itsuki! how about I've gotten much better at this, huh? Itsuki is my one and only adorable little sister. She has always been more organized than me. Whenever something bothered me, she helped me move forward. Little... For a moment you made me break out in a cold sweat. I'm going to take the opportunity to tell you this! My life is crazy since I met you! Source of evil! Curry-eating glutton girl You too! Before I met you I would never have imagined someone with such little delicacy! Heavy Head! Demon! As I thought, we will never be able to see each other's eyes as long as we live. Itsuki, she's talking like she used to again. cannot be avoided, After all, she is dealing with Fuutarou. Even with all that, I'm living life to the fullest. And what's left is... Yotsuba. Yes, it's me. If my sisters hadn't been there, my life would have been completely different. Though sometimes being a quintuplet felt like a burden, the fun memories we share are thousands of times more numerous. I have dealt with you so much that I can say it without fear of being wrong. I may have been your tutor, but I also learned a lot from you. Getting to know you quintuplets is one of the few things that makes me proud. I am indeed very grateful to have been born as a quintuplet. My family may be a little different, and other people may think we're weird. But it's the family I love with all my heart! five years... This chapter of my life is finally over. Now that the tension is gone, I feel very tired. So if you were nervous. Not as much as you, you trembled badly when we sealed our vows with a kiss. That was unavoidable. Everyone was watching and I remembered about that day five years ago. I really think it was you... Mr Groom. I'll leave this in the dressing room. Oh, thank you very much. Sorry, but I don't really need it anymore. Could you throw them for me? I'll take care of it. Are you sure? It is part of you. It's okay. Each one of you is special. Because no matter how much we look alike, there is now someone who recognizes me. How much do they do? It was a great wedding, good job to both. Why do you ask the obvious? There's only one thing left to do The honeymoon! W-Wait! Are you planning to go with us?! Of course. We were deciding where to go. This is ridiculous.. It's more fun when we're all together Don't you think? -Exactly! -Exact! Okay, let's all point to where we want to go. If you agree then... We've had this same problem before, haven't we? It's true, in high school. Alright, here we go! One... Two... and... Wake up, Uesugi-kun. Good morning! Watching you sleep makes me feel tired too. -You're going to catch a cold. -Don't sleep here and get up quickly. What about the wedding? -Huh?! -W-What? Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself? Stop being half-asleep, and decide quickly -About what? -Our graduation trip. O-Oh. it's true.. What do you think if the five of us point to where we want to go? and my opinion? -We already know how this will end... I think it's better not to continue. All right, on the count of three. One... Two... and... I want to go see Sakamoto Ryoma. It would be like any other school trip. We must go to Okinawa. In Hokaido there is a lot of delicious food... There are many other beautiful places to visit. Girls, let's decide with a rock, paper and scissors! It's true, the same thing happened that time too. They are all different places. What do you choose, Fuutarou? The Quintuplets are so annoying. Translation performed by Fuyuumi and JohnyZ2 Polished by: SimpleStickman and Koko Intro translation by: Koko
