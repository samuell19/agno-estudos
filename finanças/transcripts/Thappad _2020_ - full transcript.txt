- Why must we marry? - What? I mean we're engaged so obviously we'll get married. But why do we have to do it? You love me, I love you, we're happy, I mean mostly. So why add a new twist to the tale? Why? Which one are you? There's one 'you' who battles in court. There's another 'you' trying to make your marriage work. And this 'you' in the car with me, hollering out of the window. Out of these three, who's the real 'you'? Who knows! The three are mixed together. Boss! Two Orange Candy. Sandhya-ji! The photos have been digitized. Really? Let's see. We could get them colorised. No, leave them in black and white. See this photo? You were in the car... ...surrounded by your aunties when your father hugged me. I never told you what he said that day. Did he threaten you? "You'd better look after my daughter." No. He cried and said: "If she does anything wrong, forgive her." You've never done anything wrong. Except boiling the tea too long! What's that? My blood sugar is low today. Want some? Mom, you're being too picky. He's a good man. Of course he's a good man. But you don't like him. We've seen so many boys for you. 'Boys'? OK, men. You see after three years, I'll be sixteen. I want to see you settled before that. Because you'll be busy finding a husband for yourself. Of course. Then you'll end up all alone. Why did you marry me? You never talk to me lovingly, or even sit near me. I take care of your home, tolerate your mother's tantrums. I cook for other people, then cook for you. You beat me and then I sleep. So how can we have a child? You keep saying your mother's a better cook... ...so get her to cook. If you need a woman, go to a whorehouse. Get off! Now walk home! Sitting on my head and barking. I'll give you some love tonight. "You don't love me." I'll show you what love is. Fool! Maybe you can't have a kid. Our time is over. Our stolen moments. It's not stealing. We have the right to be happy. Are we cheating on that? Don't know. We're allowed an hour of happiness. Just driving around town. - Eating your stupid Orange Candy. - Don't call it stupid. Don't call them stolen moments. Good night. "The Slap" Amu, your internet's not working. Everything that's on the blink is mine obviously. Sit up straight! Two guys on the committee are against me. The boss has asked his daughter, Miranda, to join in. I don't know her. Everything depends on the presentation tomorrow. Amu, your printer isn't working again. Why don't you get it fixed? I don't know about your presentation... ...but I'm emotionally in London. I'm busy decorating the house with the blue door. - Let me concentrate. - Amu, please. The printer. Yes, sir. Subodh's here. I told him to call, not ring the doorbell. He'll wake Mummy. - Hello! - How are you, Amrita? Just beautiful. - Where did you disappear to? - Ask Vikram. - He's made me his slave. - It's Subodh, Mummy. Go to sleep. They'll be at it all night. Here's the history of 28 lending banks, boss. Check them. - My printer's working now. - Thanks. - How's Deepika? - She's fine. I'm getting you two married this year. Why? Don't you like seeing me happy? You'll be happier when you're married. - Some coffee? - Yes. Two cups, please. Amu, could you get me the pink file? It's upstairs. Pink? That reminds me, Pinky Chatterjee called. She's getting married. So she found someone? I emailed you a soft copy. Four anna nights, twelve anna days I save them all in a piggybank The sun rises and sets in my eyes I feel brightness surround me In my small world, this is how I am This is the way I am I'm just me, just me Good morning. Morning. You're up! Your light was on till late last night. I have a Skype call with an international client on Thursdays. - I've got a meeting today. - With Sania? - Is her dance piece ready? - Almost. I love dancing with Sania. She's really good. She loves you. You take my blood every day. If I die, I'll die in my sleep. Your sugar level agrees. You fought with your husband on the phone. When I should've fought, I didn't. No use now. I ran the house, the children are settled. My work's done. - Did Vikram get any sleep? - Yes, mother-in-law. Good morning. Good morning. Get up. I know you haven't slept much, but... Well? Will I kill it? Yes. But just don't look desperate. Don't make them think you're dying to work in London. To hell with it! Besides, you don't look good desperate. Is that so? Come on, get up. Amu, switch the water heater on. Namaste, Sunita. Madam, my life is ruined. What's new now, Sunita? Namaste, Mummy-ji. My husband kept me awake. He kept fighting with me. He took me to the doctor and asked him: "What's wrong with her? Why can't she have a child?" There may be something wrong with him. But would he ever check? Then he dumped me in the middle of the road. As soon as I got home, he started hitting me. Then? I ran out of the house and I locked him inside. Then? He was locked in all night. When I unlocked the door, he was asleep, clutching his bum. - Do you lock him in every day? - I can't. He's a man, he grabs me. And when he does, he hits me hard. But I'm smart. If he slaps me, I scream. The neighbors stop him. You little actress! Amu, ask Shivani to stop that noise. Tell her to wait till I'm gone. - Hi, ma. Good morning. - Come, have your breakfast. - What's wrong? - What is it? Let her make breakfast. Mama, please, you make the parathas. Why experiment today? I was trying to make parathas like your Mom. Sunita, get some ice. Where does it hurt? Hello? Hi, sir. Yes, sir. I'll be there. - They've asked me to come early. - Does he always call the shots? He owns the company. OK. I'm off. Bye. - Eat before you go. - No time. Have something. - Have a bite. - Amu, please. I'm late. Your files. - Thank you. - Your lunchbox. Bye. - One more bite. - Enough. - Take it with you. - Amu, please. I'm late. - OK. Fine. - Bye. Mummy, I'm going to Sania's for her dance practice. Sunita, call me if you need anything. Yes, ma'am. I just spoke to Rajhans Jetley. Miranda has chosen a white guy. Jason Burbanks. But she's happy to look at your presentation. That damn Rajhans is keen on a white guy too. - Move. - Calm down, boss. Why do they let women drive? Good job. Hampstead's a good area, aunty. It's expensive. They would choose a posh area. You know what a foodie Vikram is. I'm sure you can't hire a cook there. They must be too costly. Doesn't Mummy look cute? What's this? Look. Your prints are ready. Never seen this one before. - You shouldn't have given up dancing. - Where's the time now, Papa? You were very good. You would've gone places. Gone places? I'm heading to London as it is. Who is Mummy talking to? Your Jalandhar uncle. His daughter-in-law lives in London. Tell me something... ...are there any Indian stores in London? She's spent her life making other people happy. Making kachori for Vikram. Tehri for me and pasta for Karan. Where's Amu? Amu, Meenu was saying... ...there's a place in London called Southall. An alley leads straight from there to Amritsar. You're so foolish, Mummy! You people have made me foolish! Some people are happy by making others happy. Mothers don't have a choice. They should save some happiness for themselves. If you're unhappy, you stop feeling happy for others. Sis! You didn't tell me you were coming. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm beautiful. How are you? - Good, good. - How was Vikram's presentation? - It's finally over. He'll know their decision tomorrow. I know he'll make it. He's good. Didn't you go to Bangalore, Swati? I did. But I ran back. Everyone was talking non-stop about our wedding. The date, the venue... - I got sick and tired of it. - Swati's here! No one will believe me... ...this morning still half asleep, I soaked some kidney beans for Swati. Then I remembered she was in Bangalore. Lo and behold! A mother's intuition for you! - How cute! - Let's eat. I'll make the rotis. When's your mother coming back here? Amu thinks she should stay with us... ...till our London plans are fixed. If that's OK with you, father? Vikram, you have a home and your own company... ...so why work for others and live in a company house? Your brother Viraj wants you back. The investors and the bank are keen on expanding. It's too late. What do you mean, Vikram? We couldn't expand before but we can now. Is that a reason to leave home? The food's delicious, sister-in-law. Please teach Amu how to cook. - Did you see her jacket? - Never mind. Namaste, father-in-law. - I hear the presentation went well. - It went very well. Tomorrow's the final meeting then we'll know. One minute, don't go. Here's a sugar-free cake. Sulakshana can have it. Take it. No one believes me... ...but write the board members' names on slips of paper. Keep them in your pocket. I'm telling you, it works. - Amu, make sure you do it. - We're off, Mummy. You're so cute. - What's wrong? - Nothing, Papa. The same ole ache. OK. Bye. - Put the cake in the fridge. - Of course. I started off by saying... ...I don't want the job! Appoint your white guy. I surprised them by doing the unexpected. Then came my presentation. Even Rajhans clapped. You should've been there. What's come over you, Amu? Wait till we get home. - I'm feeling sleepy. - I'm not at all sleepy. When you're happy, your blood sugar is OK. This blood sugar will kill me some day. Why so negative? I'll make breakfast today. Just tell me what to do. Come on, get up. Why can't I cook well? Please teach me. Otherwise what will I do in London? How come you're such a good cook? I had to endure years of nagging first. Sometimes it was my husband. Or my mother-in-law. My father-in-law never said a word. Good morning! Get up! Quick. You never hear the alarm. Come on, get up! Good morning. - What time's the meeting? - 10:30. - What time will you call me? - 10:45. Wallet. - Mother's slips of paper. - You crazy? What difference will it make? Keep them. - Did Shivani buy a new car? - Yes. What work does she do? Hard work. Can I learn to drive too? First make parathas without burning your fingers. - Good morning. - Hi. Make sure your hands are like this when you turn. Start again. - Mummy-ji, there's a call. - You take it. Hello? Yes? OK. What is it? Tell me! We're off to London! But... Your son's having a party tonight for 40 guests. But we're off to London! Get me a visa too. Congrats! You deserve it. - Congratulations. - Thank you so much. Vikram... Rajhans Jetley is here. Sir. Man of the hour! Congrats! Thank you so much. Amu! - How are you? - All good. Amu... My wife, Amrita. Rajhans, our CFO. I've mentioned him to you before. - Will you have something? - In a minute. - Excuse me. - Sir, will you... Hi, Subodh. - I didn't know you smoked. - You're not supposed to know. - Does Karan know? - We kiss sometimes. Hi, sir. Where are you? No easy way to do this. Burbanks has been appointed the London head. You'll be the CEO, but working under him. Sir, must I work under a new appointee? Vikram, you have a choice. Your position is secure here. Stay in India. It's not fair, sir. This wasn't on the cards. Vikram, the chairman feels you won't attract enough investors. - The others agree. - Who else was at the meeting? That's not important. Sir, did you know? Thapar called? It's obvious, man. Let's have a drink. - What's obvious? - Everybody knows, Vikram. If you were smart, you would've understood it yourself. Sir, I'm not a smart man. You're the smart one. So you tell me. Chill, man! It's just corporate politics. Corporate politics? I'm talking. Is this is your game? Corporate politics? Why play corporate politics with you? - I'm your well-wisher, man. - I'm not your man. Thapar said everyone agreed. - Who was at the meeting? - My opinion... F*** off! The chairman had his daughter overrule the decision. - It's done. - You voted against me? Can't you see I'm talking? You voted against me 'cos you're jealous. I'll be going to London. You'll be stuck here. Yeah? You need to behave yourself. - Let me get you a drink. - Get lost! You don't know me. - You're crossing the line. - What line? The lines have been crossed. Amu, one second! Who the f*** are you? Amu, wait. Who the f*** are you? The chairman didn't think you were up to the job. That's who you are! I hear Vikram received a call. - It made him very upset. So... - So? Let's go. There are guests outside. What will they think? Amrita, it's a family matter. They cheated him, Papa. He was made to believe he'd be the London head. Thapar calls him during the party and says sorry. "You'll work under a white guy." - You can't be serious. - I'm serious. They actually... Mama... ...did Dad ever hit you? No. Your Dad never raised a hand against me. - Why are you staring at me? - I'm not. - Not staring? - No. Just looking. You're not the only man who hits his wife. I cursed you for no reason. You cursed me? Why did you hit me? Why? Do I need a license to hit you? Now run! Mr Rohit! Please turn this way. One photo, please. It was a great show. You know when I was about sixteen... ...I used to go with my Dad to public events. When people photographed him, I wondered what I was doing there. People were there to see him, to photograph him. I wonder sometimes what I'm doing with you. With only five years' experience, you have the top cases. Why? It's privilege. Because you're Justice Jaisingh's daughter-in-law. And you're Rohit Jaisingh's wife. My wife. Use this privilege and you'll be successful like me. Netra... I don't know why you're fighting. Hello, Manoj. My friend, it's impossible for me to come today. Didn't you sleep? You should've waited for Sunita. Did Vikram sleep well? Did you talk to him? Good morning. Today's a holiday. Why don't you two go and see Maharaj-ji? Tell him about London. Sunita, get me the pills. I have a fever. Amu, Thapar called last night. They want me to work under a white guy. And that Rajhans Jetley... You came in between us. You were pulling me away. I took my anger out on you. Amu... Amu. What will people think of me? I've slogged for three years. That's a lot of time. Forget the hard work. There's the emotional investment too. I used to think of this company like my own. Then I realized no one values me. This is ridiculous. Amu, I'm quitting. I cannot stay in a job where I'm not valued. Shall I oil your hair? Let's watch "Dance India". This poor girl has no mother. Her father taught her dancing. My husband hit me again last night. But I didn't run away. I thought to myself... ...if he locks me out some day, where will I go? Let's wait. If you have another fever we'll get a blood test done. What can he eat? Anything. If there's any problem, call me. Namaste. Thank you for coming. I'll see myself out. Why do you get so upset over nothing? Things happen between couples. What has a fever got to do with Amu's problems, ma? It's an old story. If Amu had a stomach ache, he would get a fever. They're overreacting. - Where are you going? - To make tea. Let me. Never mind. You boil the tea too long. Bless you. Please rest. Sandhya-ji, please phone Amu. Never mind. - Bye, Mom. I'm off. - Where to? You know, Mom. Cycling. Untie your 'ghungroo', your dancing bells. Bye, aunty. Bye, Mom. She cycles a lot these days. Yes, I've seen him. He's cute. Have tea before you go. I've made some pakoras. Want some? No. Tea's enough. Why didn't you remarry? James spoilt me before he left. Forming relationships can be easy... ...sustaining them is tough. Everything seemed effortless with him. I could be wrong... ...but everyone seems to need to make an effort. Come here. I want to give you a hug. His fever has come down. Where is he? Amu is on the line. Yes, my child? No! They're just panicking. I don't have a fever. We're built strong. Are you OK? You stay well. See you soon. OK, bye. She said, "Don't worry". How can we not worry? Did you know he hits her? Maybe it was the first time. You can't even admit to yourself that he hit her. But he did. Imagine how she's feeling. They're sensible. They'll work it out. - Good morning. - Hi. Good morning. Shall we eat out tonight? My meeting will be over at 8. I'll pick you up at 9. Bye. You're my everything You're my happiness You're my love, you're my passion Thapar found out I was talking to another company... ...so he wants to meet. Amu, I tell you... ...you have to put your bloody foot down in life. Give us a smile, Amu. - Good morning. - Hi. Good morning. When we broke apart... ...so little was left A fragment of sunlight... ...filled with dewdrops Amu... Amu! What's this? I'm going to Papa's for a few days. Why? For how long? I'll be back. You'll be back? Meaning? I don't know, Vikram. Really, wow! You know how bad I feel. You know what I'm going through. It's just for a few days. I don't feel right here. 'Feel right?' What do I tell mother? She knows. My taxi's here. Amu, hold this. This is not the time. - Forget it. - I understand, Vikram. But I need this. Fine. If you want to make this into a big deal then go! - Did something happen again? - Must she justify coming here? That's her home. I want to know why she's here. Ma, I want to spend some time with you. That's all very well, child. But... Sis, the party was days ago. We thought you would've both worked it out by now. We tried. We're trying. - What do you mean? - I need more time. Child, don't leave your home... Sandhya-ji, you won't believe it. When I came home from my walk... ...I saw a potato curry on the fire... ...and thought there was no chance Amu was here, but here she is! A father's instinct for you! What are you waiting for? Let's eat. I'm hungry. When we broke apart... ...so little was left A fragment of sunlight... ...filled with dewdrops We were tied together with a single thread... ...that came slowly undone Our names were written on the wall... ...now washed away by the rain When we broke apart... ...so little was left A fragment of sunlight... ...filled with dewdrops Are shattered dreams... ...worth living for? Are false promises... ...worth chasing? I made my mind up... ...to find myself again I must now follow my heart The road we traveled... ...seems so narrow now A fragment of sunlight... ...filled with dewdrops Papa-ji, try and make her understand. It wasn't such a big deal. A big deal, Vikram? You know how upset I was. Then half the wives in India would leave home for something so trivial. Half? Many more than half. What can I do, Papa-ji? It's done now. It's done? Vikram, the important question is why it happened. Why? I mean Thapar phoned... Vikram! You didn't tell us you were coming. Have dinner before you go. - I'll get it ready. - Don't trouble yourself. The cupboard's not opening, can you help? Come. - Give it to me. - I can manage. You look lovely. Here. I came to take you home. Not yet, Vikram. Amu, this is too much! Why are you so angry? - Let's end it! - What should I end? This fight. Let's go home. We didn't fight. Didn't you leave home? What do I tell the neighbors? Or our relatives? "My wife has left me and run away." - Why did your wife run away? - Not again! I told you. I was drunk, irritated, frustrated. If you don't understand my problems, who will? Who'll understand my problems? - Who is it all for? - Who am I doing it all for? You leaving your home... ...and getting upset. Is this what you're doing? - Is that all I've done? - Did I ask you for anything? Did I impose any conditions on you? Before we married, you said you didn't know how to cook. Me? A foodie! Did I complain? What if I had said, "I'll love you but I don't know how to earn a living." Would you have married me? And if I had said, "I'll earn the money, you learn how to cook." - Would you have married me? - It was just a moment. It'll never happen again. Who knows? But it happened once. And if I can't forget? Amu, what do you... What do you want? Tell you what. Hit me. Try it. Why don't you slap me then we'll be even? Go on. It did cross my mind to get even that way. But I couldn't do it. My parents didn't bring me up like that. Come again? Now you want to discuss our upbringing? Amu, that's going really far. My parents didn't ask for your hand. Family honor matters to us. Wives don't leave their husbands like this. We know how to keep our families together. And I'll do whatever it takes to do so. Has Vikram left? Amu... Take care. This is an historical victory in a sexual harassment case... ...for the fearless lawyer Netra Jaisingh, a great advocate of women's rights. Let me read the entire judgement. Thank you. Chef, replacement's on the fryer. Plates out. Going on call. Hi. Did you see me? Yeah. Of course I was watching. Live on TV. I was so proud of you. You know it was absolutely commendable the way you handled yourself. When you stepped out, I could see the confidence in your walk. The victory in your smile. I'm so happy for you. You know I felt so good. Even in the middle of that chaos I could feel the wind on my face... ...as though I was looking out of a car window... ...and flying. Thanks to you. Any time. Be happy. Keep flying. Hi. Good morning. Kapoors have been pushed to 5pm. Raghuvanshi's petition has been filed. Amrita, Netra. Netra, Amrita. Hi, Amrita. Give me five minutes. State of India vs. Shagun Verma. I won! Everyone says your daughter-in-law is your worthy junior. Thank you, father-in-law. Section 9. Restitution of conjugal rights. A legal notice ordering you to go home. I don't want to. Why not? Don't feel like it. Unfortunately, not feeling like it doesn't work in court. One slap cannot be the only reason. What's the real story? His family? No. Was he having an affair? No. - You're having an affair? - No. Sexual? No. So, just one slap then? That's unusual, Amrita. People may think you're unreasonable. Don't those people think slapping is unreasonable? Maybe. But your reaction could seem unreasonable. I can't respect myself any more. I chose to be a housewife. No one forced me. I'm not complaining. I was happy to be a part of his dreams. And his life. But, along the way... ...I might have become the kind of person someone slaps. Isn't that unreasonable? He cannot hit me. "Just a slap?" He cannot slap me. What do you want? I want to be happy. So when I say I'm happy, I would not be lying. You have three options. The first and easiest, go back. Make it work. That would be my advice. Or you have legal options. Judicial separation. You'll remain his wife, but you won't live with him. Or divorce. But the legal options can get very messy, Amrita. So we lie to ourselves and say we're happy. I don't want to lie. To him or to myself. Think it over. Things are not what they seem Relationships are hard to sustain May no one break my heart May no one turn their back on me May no one abandon me Life is long Living is hard Time does not pass without my beloved O Lord, my heart knows no peace Without my beloved... ...all is darkness O Lord, my heart knows no peace You shouldn't have introduced Amu to your boss, Netra. Karan, she was served a legal letter. They were fine. Nice life, nice home. Swati, it was one small episode. I know it shouldn't have happened but this is silly. It was the first time. Right. Tell me something, Karan... ...if I cheated on you for the first time... ...would you forget it? - Or if you cheated on me? - You're overreacting. - Cheating is simply immoral. - Exactly. Should we make a list of what's immoral and what's not? I never thought we'd see the day a daughter of ours gets divorced. Where did we go wrong? We raised her, educated her... ...married her into a good family. Now it's her responsibility. It's her home. So look after it. Women have to learn tolerance to keep the family together. - One has to suppress one's feelings. - There's no need. Did you ever have to? Of course I did. Didn't I have desires? I wanted Amu to become a dancer like Sitara Devi. My father wanted me to sing on All India Radio. But I had to compromise. Should I have looked after the house and kids? Or sing songs? Sandhya-ji... ...did I ever stop you? So what if you didn't? Don't I have a mind of my own? Didn't I know what was important? Who told you what was important? My mother said a home is more important. Her mother taught her a home is all important. Didn't you know? Did you ever ask, "Sandhya, why don't you sing anymore?" You knew people would gossip... ..if I had sung after marriage. I didn't say a word, but you let it pass too. I suppressed my feelings. He was wrong to hit you but he can't take it back. So, what do you think I should do? You should give him a chance. Imagine how embarrassed he already is, at home and in the office. Everyone's problems are important except Amu's. Amu has much more to lose. Men can remarry easily. But she'll have the tag of a divorcee. I don't get you. I'm on her side. Do me a favor. Swati, please don't get involved. My sister's marriage is breaking. So who'll fix it? Amu? He's sending her legal notices. It's like I'm talking to a stranger. I'm gonna go now. You know what? That's a great idea. You should go. Her life's at stake. And you and your Netra are fighting the case. Please leave. - Please leave. - Enough, Karan! Let go. Get out. Say sorry to her. Say sorry at once. Or leave this house now. Go! Swati, I'm really sorry. Good night, Mummy. Papa, I'm not... It's not about me. It's for everyone's good. I'm saying this for Amu's sake. Ma, I swear to you... Talk to Swati, not to me. They're blind. When I was watching you on TV, I thought Salve had lost on purpose. Salve is overrated. I'm proud of you. You're looking beautiful. When I saw you on TV, I was reminded of Dad. Whenever he won a big case... ...he would look down and walk away... ...as if it was no big deal. Big man. Look at you walk. Your smile. There's victory in your eyes. It's OK. Success does different things to different people. Come here. Come. I'll make myself a drink. Let's celebrate. Rohit, you're drunk and I'm tired. Please. You're so beautiful. You never even thanked me. Remember who introduced you to Shagun Verma? I texted you as soon as I got into the car. A text? Who thanks anyone with a text? Only strangers do that. But now I'm here... - ...you can thank me properly. - Rohit, I can't. I tell you what... ...you just stand here. Relax. Let me enjoy your gratitude. Are you deaf? Can't you see I'm eating? Deaf idiot! Do you need your ears to eat? I'm watching TV. That's it. So shut up. Let him come home. He'll fix you! - Are you deaf? - No, you're the one who's deaf. You wanna watch TV? Deaf idiot! Sunita! Sunita. - Mummy. - Yes? Why are you making the tea? Where's Sunita? Her husband beat her badly, she couldn't come to work today. Isn't it your prayer time? - Let me make the tea. - No, you go! - Let me. - I'll do it. Mummy, where are the tea leaves? They're finished. You'll have to open a new packet. - Found it? - Yes. "Urgent action will make the consequences of global warming manageable. "What is at stake is the half of ecosystem, wildlife... "...and importantly, the world we leave for our children." Father-in-law, get well. I need to talk to you. We're filing for a divorce... ...on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. Amrita, I'm a lawyer but I'm also a woman. Are you sure about this? Taking this path could be very difficult for you. Think it over again. Every relationship is flawed. One has to mend it. If you have to mend it, it means it's broken. What shall I do? Pretend? For how long? I'll soon become resentful and start hating him. Netra, I've loved him for so long. It's not entirely his fault, it's mine too. I let it happen. It's also my mother's fault... ...for bringing me up this way. Vikram's mother is to blame too. What would you do in my shoes? I'd forgive him. So am I wrong? No. Does she have a real case for divorce? When you're truly in love, I mean truly in love... ...a little physical aggression is an expression of love. He slapped her once and she wants a divorce. There's nothing here, Viraj. No claims, no allegations. She wants a divorce by mutual consent, on grounds of irreconcilable differences. If you both want a divorce, then this letter is sufficient. But if you don't want to divorce... ...as a lawyer, my advice would be don't go to court. Try and finish this off. Otherwise it can get long drawn. Thankfully there's no mention of domestic violence. Domestic violence, sir? I was there. She was the one pulling him. Try and understand what I'm saying. I'm trying to explain. If she decides to press charges of domestic violence... ...it becomes a police case. Then it gets complicated. Long drawn. Talk to her. Persuade her. Threaten her. Talk to her. What happens in court? We're the ones who talk... ...on your behalf. Things get ugly in court. So talk to her, OK? Viraj, how's she affording Netra? She seems to have some connection with Netra's assistant. OK. So we need to be prepared. In case she files charges of domestic violence... ...you'll need witnesses who'll testify nothing happened at the party. - Buy them. - OK. Also, the police will have the power to arrest Vikram. Don't worry. I'm there. Namaste, Mummy-ji. I'm here. Mummy-ji, will you eat in your room or out here? Mummy-ji, why won't you answer? Mummy-ji. Mummy-ji is upstairs. I'll clean Vikram sir's room. Amu ma'am will scold me. Mummy-ji! Ma'am, it's me. Come home at once. Her blood sugar has dropped. If Amrita had called me even ten minutes later... You know what a coma is, Mrs Sabharwal? Is that what you want? Amrita, you'll have to be strict. OK? I've written up a prescription. Please get the medicine. She's fine. Nothing to worry about. Thank you. I'm right outside. What are you doing, ma? I'll talk to her. Go and talk to her. Come home with me. I won't leave Vikram here alone. It makes no difference if I die. - What are you saying? - Am I wrong? What will change for you? Morning golf? Evening billiards? Now the servants cook your meals. I'll come every day till you're well. I'll stay till you return from work. Shall we go? Bless you. You're divorcing me? Amu, it's not too late. Come back home. How amazing! You think everything is fine. I think things are dreadful. Clearly we see life very differently. S*** happens, Amu. It happens. People move on. You were so emotionally invested in your company, you could not move on. I invested my whole life in you. How can I move on? I can't do it. I don't love you. He refuses mutual consent. We'll have to go to court. Read the petition details. Then we'll get it ready. Netra, this is all wrong. Maintenance? 50% of the property? I don't want anything. - It all belongs to him. - Really, Amu? Who looked after the house? Who looked after him? From morning tea to dinner? Is he in a good or bad mood? Let him sleep. He has an early flight. Who did all that? Your life is invested in everything he has. Amu, you could've had your own career. It might've been worth more than 50%. Didn't you give it all up? - Swati, that was my choice. - You have no investments. Will you start again from scratch? It wasn't some deal, Netra. It was love. All marriages are deals, Amrita. A contract between two people. Love is not mandatory in marriage. You can love without being married. Do you think all marriages run on love? It's an unfair deal. You get some sense of dignity and security. That's why you're here. Allow me to get you a fair deal, in your favor. We had a fair deal. He earned money and I looked after the house. What's unfair is the slap. What's unfair is the expectation that I should move on. What's unfair is all my options are messy and unpleasant. What's unfair is even you advise me to accept the unfair. Maybe it's because you haven't experienced the unfair. Everyone says, "It's just a slap". Know what that slap did? Suddenly I became aware of all the unfair things... ...I had learned to accept. What's expected of me is that I move on from the unfair. That slap took me back to the Amrita in college. The Amrita who wanted only two things in life... ...respect and happiness. You know what? That's all this Amrita wants too. - How are you, Shankar? - All good. My regular. Same for him. - Netra, it's 5am. - Sorry. I got you up so early. - Must be special? - It is. I felt like revisiting my past. The old days seem so far off now. This was the college hangout. We made so many plans here. It's never too late. Who knows why I'm telling you this? I know why. I remind you of Rohit. The Rohit you fell in love with. If you find that Rohit again I'll be out of your life. And I'm OK to play the part for as long as you want. Thanks for meeting me. Let it go, child. Women must learn to be tolerant. Are you happy... ...being tolerant? My sons are happy. So is my husband. We women don't matter. Our happiness is in their happiness. Papa, I must finish some work. I'll join you soon. I'll see you at Gujral's office. Shall I pick you up? I need something from the cupboard. May I? I'll call you in five. Come. What is it? I need something from the cupboard. What do you need? You want all this? That's yours. All these clothes belong to you. It's all yours. What doesn't belong to you? Go on, tell me. Here are your files. Your lawyer sent me a letter. A sweet letter. You want it? Or shall I keep it? What should I do? I'll keep it. The alarm clock belongs to you. Take it. I'm getting late for work. I'm off. Bye. Thanks. By the way, what's this drama you've created? You want to prove to everyone how sweet and responsible you are. But you're not that sweet. You've been fooling the world. You want a divorce, I'll give you a divorce. Amrita, you've turned my life upside down. I'll give you a divorce. Vikram has replied. I've emailed it to you. Can you read it now? I'll hold. Sure. Papa, may I use your computer? Are you reading it? Yes. They say you want a divorce because Vikram is not going to London. And you're making the slap an excuse. Apparently when he left his father's home and business... ...you tormented him. You wanted to share his wealth. He says you married him because you were eyeing his family property. You were physically violent at the party. You were drunk and dragged him into the bedroom. Vikram says he tried to free his hand, that's when you got hit. Everyone saw it happen. Amu, your bank account's frozen. Even your credit card is blocked. Amrita, I assume their statements are all lies, right? And you wanted to play fair. Now you see how low they'll stoop. He'll force witnesses to say he didn't hit you. They'll say you were drunk and you misbehaved that night. That you're a manic depressive, and sometimes get out of control, etc. I told you this is not going to be easy. If it was that easy, half the marriages would end in divorce. You still want to play fair? Yes. It's not about them. It's about me. Let him do what he wants. I'll do what I believe is right. Even that has repercussions. Even doing wrong has repercussions. He hit me. For the first time. But he can't. He can't hit me even once. End of story. That's what my petition is about. Vikram, listen... They're s*** scared. They're in a board meeting. Don't ask who told me. But everyone knows you're planning on quitting. Thapar told Miranda, "We cannot let Vikram go. He's indispensable". And you won't believe it, even Rajhans fought for you. He said: "Vikram deserves the London job". Brother! Miranda is going to call you. - Now be happy. - I am happy. London! You're back? Is Amu here? I heard her voice. Maybe she's in the bathroom. I'll be back in an hour. We'll talk later. Bless you, child. Are you alright? I'm fine. How are you? Beautiful. - Is Vikram in? - Upstairs. He just came home. Vikram. I did a pregnancy test at home. It's been two months. I'm pregnant. You're... ...pregnant? With so much going on, I didn't realize... Where's your smile? We're having a baby! This is the most wonderful day. I've just quit smoking too. Miranda has agreed to all my conditions. We're going to London. I'm going to be the boss like I always wanted to be. It's perfect! Everything is working out. Remember this? I wrote my life goals in my diary. 2020, we go to the UK. 2020, father. 2022, father again. 2025, we shift to America. Amu. Amu, think about the baby at least. You can't do this. I didn't do this. Will you ruin your child's life out of stubbornness? If I stayed, I'd ruin three lives. Mine, yours and the child's. The only reason I'd stay is if I loved you. And I don't. I told you. This child is yours and mine. That's the way it'll be. You can't decide alone. You decided what you had to. Go wherever you want. Go. But I won't let you take my child with you. Get it? I promise that. It doesn't have to be like this. Sandhya-ji... ...you know our daughter is going to be a mother. Such happy news! You're going to be a grandmother. How can I be happy? This isn't happy news. Maybe the circumstances are sad. But can't we celebrate? When you were carrying Amu, my mother said: "Keep Sandhya happy. "If the mother is happy, the child will be born happy." For nine months I didn't argue with you even once. Good night. Sandhya-ji... ...we must keep our daughter happy. Your Papa wasn't always like this. When I was a newly-wed... ...he would recite revolutionary poetry to me. Our Mussoorie honeymoon was spent listening... ...to the revolutionary poet's Ramdhari Singh Dinkar's verse. Remind me. "The battle is not over, the hunter alone is not to blame. "Those who stand by and watch... "The crimes of bystanders will be remembered by history." When I was pregnant with you, his mood changed. He turned from a revolutionary into a true romantic. Sweetheart... ...if the mother is happy, the child will be born happy. - Sandhya-ji, your tea's getting cold. - Pass it to me. Papa... Am I making a mistake? We only do what we think is right. You'll know later if you're wrong. This isn't just a whim, is it? Is this what you truly want? Sure? Thought it over carefully? Then you're doing the right thing. Doing the right thing doesn't always end in happiness. OK? Drink your tea. Come, madam. You've done what you had to. Now he'll handle the rest. You want a legal battle? What do you mean? She has my child. You're leaving for London. She isn't. She has nothing to lose. You do. - Do you want that? - So, what do I do? Abandon my child and go? Just because I slapped her once. Calm down. Relax, brother. This is too much. Do everything you can. She can't afford to fight the case. I know the family. Be aggressive. Bring them down to the negotiating table and then offer them a deal. No child in our family will end up an orphan. Let her go. Her loss. - Sunita. - Yes, sir. Your wages. Sir, you've given me too much. This is your wage from now on. Keep it. Clear the table. Let me know if madam rings. I really didn't see anything. Unfortunately Sania did. I don't know what's come over her. I'm doing everything I can to get her back, Shivani. I might need your help. I know I'm asking a lot but... ...I might need you to say... ...that nothing happened at the party. You know what, Vikram? I was married to a wonderful man. I would like to believe men are wonderful people. So I prefer to pretend I didn't hear what you just said. Netra, my client has agreed to the divorce. He's proposing to give his Noida apartment to your client. We're also ready to discuss alimony. But my client wants full and complete custody of the child. During pregnancy she'll have to stay at her father-in-law's house. After all, it's Vikram's first child. Either you've forgotten or misunderstand, but this is not a custody battle. My client is seeking a divorce from your client on mutual consent. Domestic violence charges have not been filed or mentioned. Netra, I'm offering you this deal... ...because neither of us want to go to court. You and I know how ugly it gets in court. We don't want that. Do we? We have an eyewitness testimony. Someone willing to testify... ...that no violence took place at the party. We could go to court, but we don't want to. You know how inflated petitions can get. As though you had left anything out in the present one. Look at her. Has she ever tortured your mother? I insist you don't talk to my client directly, Netra. Can your client look at my client and tell me... ...when he was at work, didn't she, from morning to night... ...look after everything? Didn't she run the house? A house that's in his sole name. You want to save your marriage? But in his petition... ...he says his mother almost fell into a coma due to her negligence. I'm warning you, I'll terminate this session. Does he know the difference between fasting sugar and PP sugar? Know how much blood sugar levels fluctuate? You are not obligated to respond to this. No, of course he's not. Men rarely are, right? You're attacking my client. Please stop this. No, Mr Gujral, you are attacking my client. I'm done now and so are you. You'll be hearing from us. Mrs Sabharwal... ...you've read our petition and we've read yours. This can go on for years. Vikram is being kind enough to discuss a settlement. You can have what you want and so can we. That's it. Amrita, I've known you for years. I'm sorry to say this, but you need better legal advice. She doesn't know when she turned from lawyer to activist. She didn't turn from lawyer to activist... ...she turned from a lawyer into a woman. Of course, that's not right. Now? Now nothing. Look, she was never going to take this deal. But now she knows getting a divorce isn't easy. She's going to come back. Wait and watch. They're not going to agree. Netra, I can't lie. He slapped you. Is that a lie? It isn't, is it? Let me charge him with domestic violence. Or they'll say you're a manic depressive, a drunk and insane. They'll prove it all. You'll be fighting the case for the rest of your life. Thank you, Mr Gujral. Thank you so much. Do you seriously want to do this? Mother has organized a prayer meeting for our baby. She's praying she'll hold her grandchild in her arms. She's waiting for you. For her grandchild. We can still move to London. To Hampstead. The house with a blue door. Everything will be fine. Really? You really think everything will be fine? If I'd seen this side of you before, I'd never have loved you. But thanks for convincing me. I have no plans to deny your mother of her grandchild. Netra and I did not even suggest it. Though you did suggest buying this child from me. But I'm sorry. It's not for sale. Really sorry. And tell Mummy-ji, I'll be at the prayer meeting. And in your next petition you can say I'm a drunk and a manic depressive. Your petition's incomplete. You can do better. I didn't hear your last words to him. The rest was pitch perfect! - Vikram, come in. - Sir. - Happy? - It's what I wanted. Sir, I want to say thank you. Subodh told me how hard you fought for me. You thought I was against you. I was just telling you the truth. Sir, I'm... - I'm sorry about that party night. - That's OK. Subodh filled me in. Sorry to hear about the home front. Sit down. - Can I say something? Don't mind. - No, sir. It was your fault, Vikram. You don't hit your wife. It's not done. You were furious with me and Thapar. But would you hit us? And for whatever it's worth... I think you should've given her more time. She must've been hurt. Why didn't you wait a few days? You and I are running some sort of strange race. We have to win. Improve our timing. Then break a world record. But our family isn't running in that race. This is not good. Exactly what I feared. They've filed 498A and Section 354 in the magistrate's court. Meaning? Domestic violence and outraging a woman's modesty. It's a police case. They can arrest you. - But I didn't outrage... - Yes. You did! Take it. Amrita has sent an MoU. Agree to a divorce by mutual consent, then they'll withdraw the police case. She doesn't want anything. Only joint custody of the child. So it's either this or court. Sorry to keep you waiting. All signed and good to go? Where's Amrita? I will speak to her. She'll be at the prayer meeting. And if I may speak to your client directly? Sign. It's the best deal. Threatening me? No. Legal advice. You need better legal advice. Bless you. Don't eat anything sweet. Tell someone to check your blood sugar every day. You're not that old. You have a lot to live for. Take care of yourself. You make such delicious food. Start a cookery school. There are many like me who can't cook. You'll be busy. Teach everyone... ...the way to a man's heart is through his belly! You arranged such a grand wedding for us. When I played in the park nearby, I'd stare at Vikram from afar. I never thought I'd marry into such a rich family. In fact, I never thought I would ever marry. Everyone asked what I wanted to be when I grew up. I don't remember saying I wanted to be a housewife. I don't know how my mother came to you with a marriage proposal. And how Vikram agreed. I didn't even know how to make parathas. I don't know why Vikram accepted. Then I thought I may not be the best dancer... ...but I can become the world's best housewife. I tried very hard. I promise. I was so busy keeping Vikram happy... ...I even forgot blue was not my favorite color. My favorite color is yellow. Right, Papa? You showered me with love. But on the night of the party, I realized you loved Vikram's wife... ...not me. After that night none of you came to see me. No one told Vikram it was his fault. Everyone thought what Vikram did was OK. And if it was not OK, Amu should put it behind her. She should move on. I can't forgive you for that. In the circumstances, I can't live with Vikram or any of you. Vikram and I are fighting... ...and we'll keep fighting. But it was our love and our fight. We will love our child. I'll love the baby... ...and Vikram will love it even more. You'll see. I'm going now. I'll come and see you. It's not your fault. It's the fault of us mothers. And fathers. We never taught our sons they could not slap a woman. It was your mother's fault. She told you to stay silent. We have no right to ask you to stay. Go. Be happy. Visit me often. Swati, I'm just... You deserve better. I don't know how often I've disappointed you. I said sorry... ...but it had no meaning. I wasn't willing to hear what my sister Amu wanted. And then I behaved the same way with you. You were there for her when I wasn't. And for that I am... ...so, so sorry. I'm sorry for letting you down. I need to reboot, you know. I need to become someone better. Someone who deserves you. Karan, I was not going to come back from Bangalore. But I won't go anywhere now. I'm gonna be here with you. We'll reboot together. I'm leaving your father's company, Rohit. I'm opening a new law firm. No more favors from you. No more privileges of being your wife or his daughter-in-law. I'm leaving, Rohit. I'll come and see your father from time to time, if that's OK? Priyan... ...I won't be seeing you again. What's wrong, Netra? You were right. Those were stolen moments. The time we spent together. I'm starting afresh. I didn't want you to make your life decisions for me. I don't want that. I just want to be happy in everything I do now. That's all. Be happy. Be good. OK? I won't go to work. I'll look after the house. You want to be a man? I want to be a woman. We'll manage with your earnings. I'll stop working. Don't hit me. Don't hit me. Then go ahead, kill me. Go on. Kill me. If you don't, I'll slit your throat when you're asleep. Kill me! Kill me! You think you're a real man. Bye. Hello. I've stopped looking for a husband for you. It's very tough. Good plan. But I've found a boy for you. I've been watching him. He's nice. Please, Mom. My baby. I'm happy as I am. Sorry, Papa. I've ordered a sofa. But they keep delaying the delivery. There's no sign of them. Be careful. I was reciting my new poem in the college where I taught. We were talking about it when I heard you were born. Did you know the title of my poem? "Amrita." That's why we called you "Amrita." Yes, I turned my veil into the sky If my path strays from my desires If my chest falls short of breath I should have that sky of mine I want to scatter myself in every direction I want you to call out for me in every direction If you find me, hold me close But fold my sky and return it to me So you have a sky of your own And I have a sky of my own Hi. Just check everything's in order. Hi. May I talk to you? I never imagined we'd end up in court. I messed up, Amu. No... I'm not asking you for anything. I have no right. I had no right to slap you. Why did I think I had that right? No one has that right. And I never apologized to you, actually. I never said sorry. When I said: "I love you", I thought that was enough. Goodness knows what I wrote in those petitions. I'm sorry for it all, Amu. I truly am. When I entered that Hampstead house with its blue door... ...it didn't feel like home. You're my home. So I quit my job. That house, Hampstead, the job, everything. I'll start from zero. Next time I'll deserve you. See me sometimes, my friend. When we broke apart... ...so little was left A fragment of sunlight... ...filled with dewdrops Are shattered dreams... ...worth living for? Are false promises... ...worth chasing? I made my mind up... ...to find myself again I must now follow my heart The road we traveled... ...seems so narrow now A fragment of sunlight... ...filled with dewdrops
