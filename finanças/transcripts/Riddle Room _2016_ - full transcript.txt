(music) (glass shattering) (ominous music) - No, no! No! (crying) Please. - [Voiceover] Think. What is it you'd like to do? - [Voiceover] You know damn well what I wanna do. - [Voiceover] Excellent. (heart beating) (suspenseful music) We haven't much time. (crying) (grunting) (footsteps) (scraping) (groaning) (heavy breathing) (banging) (gasping) (grunting) - No, no! No, stop it! (gun clicks) (crying) (static) (suspenseful music) (gasping) What did you do? (crying) (banging) (footsteps) (heavy breathing) - What's your name? - Emily. Emily Burns. - And how do you earn a living, Mrs. Burns? - I'm an associate professor of pharmacology at a small school named Cortland College. It's in the -- - Tell me about January 11th, Mrs. Burns. - Please, sir, I'll answer whatever it takes, please just let me go, I-- - Tell me about January 11th Mrs. Burns. - What about it? (door slams) (door locks) (crying) No. (gasping) (clinking) (static) - [Voiceover] Come on, valedictorian! Give us a smile, come on! - Dad, put it away. - [Voiceover] Not until I see that smile. - Happy? - [Voiceover] Give your mother a kiss for the camera. You're wanted by all these medical companies and you can't even give your mother a little kiss. Come on now, give her a kiss. Aw wait, now I'm jealous, come over here. - Now leave her alone Bill, let her have a good time. (static) (ominous music) - How? How'd you get it? Why ask me questions you already know the answers to? (crying) (banging) - [Woman] Please, I'll do whatever you ask, just please let me out. I don't know! (screaming) (doorknob rattling) - No, no, no! (grunting) No, no, please no. No! - Shh. (gasping) - Tell me about January 11th, Mrs. Burns. Or shall I say Doctor Burns? (bubbling) - I don't know what you're talking about, I swear. - [Man] Tell me about January 11th, Doctor Burns. - Please, I don't! I don't know what you're talking about! (ticking) (bubbling) (gasping) - Time's ticking, Doctor Burns. (screeching) - Repetition is something to be embraced, Doctor Burns, not shunned. - Look, can we please find some time to sit down and talk, some real time? You name it. (snapping) - [Man] I need you to focus. (scratching) (snapping) Every second counts. (soft instrumental music) - Oh my god, oh my god. Manda. Manda is that you? - Emily? Oh thank god. Oh thank god! I've been so afraid! - How long have you been here? - 14 hours, 43 minutes, 16 seconds. I wanna go home. I just wanna go home. - Stay strong for me, okay? We're gonna get out of here, both of us together, you hear me? - How? - Do you have any tools we can use? - No, not really. Just a cot. - Damn it, me too. What do these people want from us? - January 11th. - They keep saying that, but what the hell does that mean? - January 11th. - I don't know. I don't understand. - Me neither. (static) Emily? - [Emily] Hold on. - [Amanda] Wait! Emily, don't leave me! - [Emily] Hold on. - [Man] You want some cereal baby? Milk? You like your cereal. - Baby. I'm coming. - [Man] You want some grapes? (phone ringing) Hello? - [Emily] Andrew. - Hey, yeah. Thanks for calling me back. No, I don't know where she is at all. No, she didn't come home last night. - No, I'm here! I'm here! No. - [Andrew] Thanks for calling. Okay, yeah I'll let you know. - [Emily] Andrew. Please. - [Andrew] All right, bye. - No, no, come on! Come back please, no, come back! Tell me, tell me what you want! Please tell me! (screeching) (pounding) (crying) Ah, stop. Please. Be the leader. Be the leader. Be the leader. (gasping) (thudding) (footsteps) You've been watching me. You've been watching my family, why? What kinda people are you? What kind of importance could I possibly have? - Do you know this man, Doctor Burns? - I do. - And who is this man, Doctor Burns? - David Cobb. Professor Cobb, my superior. - Is there something you would like to tell me about this man, Doctor Burns? - No. - Are you sure, Doctor Burns? Look deeply, Doctor Burns. Is there something you would like to tell me about this man? - [Voiceover] Firefighters have only been able to contain about ten percent thus far. - [Voiceover] If you're just joining us, we're live in downtown Detroit, where an explosion has led to a devastating fire on the campus of Cortland College. One staff member has been confirmed dead at the scene. - [Emily] No! - [Voiceover] Doctor David Cobb, a professor in the Cortland pharmacology department. - David! - Tell me about January 11th, Doctor Burns. - What have you done? - Tell me about January 11th, Doctor Burns. - I don't know what the hell that means! What is this? - You know exactly what that is. - (mumbling) discovery? - Very good. - No, I mean, I know of it. It was a side project of his. A treatment of pre-gangrenous sores to prevent amputation. I've never actually seen the target findings. He was very, very private with his personal work. - But you admit your connection to this. - I'm his associate professor, that's it! If he was up to something else, then I have no idea what that was! This is the first I've seen of any of this. I'm telling you. - We will see. - Who are you? The CIA? FBI? Because, I swear to you, you have the wrong person! - You leave me so few options. - I'm an associate professor, for God's sakes! I have a family and a mortgage, please, I don't know what you think I could possibly be involved with! Please! I shouldn't be here! I shouldn't be here! Finish it. - [Amanda] Emily. Emily! Emily! What's going on? What's happening? - They killed him. - Who? Who did they kill? - Cobb. - What? - He's dead. - No. No, that can't be true. They're lying, they're lying to you. - They burned it down, all of it. The lab, the annex, everything. - This can't be happening. This can't be happening. Why? What reason would they have to do that? - A set up, to prove a point, to cover something up, because they're insane? - Wait, just calm down. - The two of us, who knows if we'll ever get out of here alive. - I'm scared enough as it is without you saying these things Emily. Just calm down. - I'm gonna ask you something, and I need an honest answer. - Did they ask you anything specific? - This is very important. - Emily. - [Emily] Amanda, please. - What did they say to you? - Damn it Amanda, listen! Was there anything going on with Cobb that I didn't know about? Anything suspicious or unusual? - No. Not that I know of. Wait! Wait, no, I'm sorry! Emily, please, I'm sorry! Emily. What is this? - Project Hazel. - [Amanda] Pre-gangrenous treatment? I don't understand. - They want me to finish it. - This is what they want? They want you to finish it? - I can't do that. - Emily, please! - If I could, I would. And if they're smart enough to pull off whatever this is they know that too. There has to be more to this. - You have to try, our lives depend on it! - Amanda, please. - Emily, try! - Damn it, Amanda, do you really wanna help? - Of course. - Don't be so naive. You know without the proper screening tools I can't just... - Just show your next move, do anything, show them you're willing to cooperate. - Are you even listening to me? (old-fashioned music) (ominous music) (record scratches) (suspenseful music) (screeching) Something's not right. - What are you talking about? - I'm getting us out of here. (soft instrumental music) (grunting) (groaning) (screeching) - [Cobb] Repetition is something to be embraced, Doctor Burns, not shunned. I really am stuck, Emily. - [Emily] Anything you need. - [Cobb] Jesus, I think you nailed it, Emily! (static) (crowd mumbling) - [Voiceover] How much have you had? (cheering) - [Emily] How old are you? How many is that? - Four. - [Emily] Are you sure? I thought you were three. You're four? - I'm gonna eat the whole thing in one bite! - [Emily] One bite? You might get sick after that. Get him! - Good work Sweetheart, high five. High five. Yeah. - [Girl] This is my cake. - [Man] All right, Godmother, you're up. - Hi Maddie, honey, I love you, happy birthday. You're the cutest four-year-old ever. Cheers to you, baby. (laughing) - [Man] Nice touch. Hey love birds, give us a kiss! (laughing) (static) - No I don't... No, I don't care! But I wanna be out there! She's my, she's my wife! (static) (cheering) (static) (mumbling) What good am I doing here? (static) (cheering) - Get over here. - It's your day. - Give me a kiss. - I love you baby. - It's your birthday! (static) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (clicking) (gasping) (screeching) (suspenseful music) (gasping) This is impossible. What is going on here? (footsteps) - Why do you breathe so heavily, Doctor Burns? (gasping) (humming) You enjoy this song, don't you? Where do you know it from, Doctor Burns? Speak to me, Doctor Burns. (humming) Doctor Burns. Your work can be very consuming, is that right, Doctor Burns? Keeping you from your family? How do you feel abandoning them now? (clattering) Now we're getting somewhere. David! - Tell me! - [Man] Calm down. - What are you doing to my head? - Drop it! - What am I doing here? - Drop it now, put it down! Killing my boss, force me into working for you, is that what you want? Is that what you want? (shot) (groaning) - You idiot! Hold her down! - No, no! (screaming) No! (door slams) - [Man] Think. What is it you'd like to do? - [Cobb] I think this looks really solid. - [Emily] I have to make a call. (screeching) You've been watching me. Why? - Do you know this person, Doctor Burns? - Yes. - And who is this person, Doctor Burns? - David Cobb. - Is there something you would like to tell me about this person, Doctor Burns? (ominous music) - Oh my god. - What? - I have to make a call. - Everything all right? - Yeah, yeah, I just have to make a call. - [Man] We're making splendid progress. (mechanical whirring) (buzzing) (grunting) (gasping) - No. No, Manda, no! No, no, Amanda no! Don't give in, no! No, no, no! Please don't give in. Please Amanda, I need you! Please, no. No Amanda, no. (suspenseful music) Come on. (gasping) Come on. Amanda. Amanda, Amanda please, don't do this. Please don't give in. - Good luck Emily. - This isn't how this ends. Just help me get through this wall. (footsteps) - [Amanda] Please, I'll do whatever you ask, just please let me out. I don't know what you want. Please, please. (mumbling) (screaming) - No. (banging) No. (gasping) (footsteps) No, oh my god. Please. (crying) (ticking) - [Man] Doctor Burns, Mr. Burns, I'm Doctor Norman Atley. You are aware of what it is I do, are you not? (screeching) - You have to try, our lives depend on it! - Amanda, that's impossible. - No, at least show them your next move, give them something to go on! Show them you're willing to cooperate! - Amanda! - Anything is better than nothing! - Do you really want to help? - Of course! - Then don't be so naive. (old-fashioned music) - What's that? You know it. - I know it. - What is it? - I don't know. (man mumbling) - [Emily] Anything you need. (ticking) You really need to work on expanding your horizons. - What? - I've heard this song enough to sing it backwards. - Repetition is something to be embraced, Doctor Burns, not shunned. - We'll find your target. - I really am stuck Emily. - [Emily] I'll find your target. - [Man] He's gone, so you're it. (buzzing) (footsteps) (heavy breathing) - [Man] Brought you some food. You need to stay focused. Eat. Eat. - Kill me. You're gonna do it, so just do it. - [Man] Not if you cooperate, Doctor Burns. - Bullshit. - [Man] Have you finished the work, Doctor Burns? What about January 11th, Doctor Burns? You've been making such progress. Sadly to say, your friend did not. You've been speaking with her, Doctor Burns? - And you've known that. Just do it. - [Man] Time's ticking, Doctor Burns. - Screw your damn clock. - [Man] We haven't much time now, Doctor Burns. (footsteps) (splashing) Are you ready to finish what we started, Doctor Burns? (gasping) Are you ready to give me what I need? - Go fuck yourself. (bubbling) - Fight! Fight! Fight me! Fight me! (pounds) Congratulations, Doctor Burns, you'll be seeing your daughter soon enough. - Hey George. - It's time. - No, it's too soon. - I said it's time! - [Henchman] No, stick to the plan! - Tape four. - But sir, you can't-- - I said tape four! Last shot. (static) - [Andrew] Maddie, baby. Maddie? Sweetheart? Maddie, counting to 100. Where are you? Maddie? Maddie! Maddie! Maddie! (static) (soft instrumental music) (ominous music) (knocking) - [Emily] Hello? Hello, I have to use the bathroom! Hello! Somebody! I have to go to the bathroom! (footsteps) Please, I just really have to go to the bathroom. - [Henchman] No. - I'm not gonna go to the bathroom in here. - [Henchman] Suit yourself. - Please, please, I'll talk, I'll tell you whatever you wanna know, I'll finish the formula, anything you want. Please. - [Henchman] Is that so? - Yes, just let me use the bathroom, and for God's sake, something else to eat, and I'll talk. I just, just need to see my daughter. - [Henchman] You hear that? - [Man] Make it quick. - [Henchman] Got it. (grunting) (running footsteps) (yelling) (grunting) - God damn it! (yelling) (coughing) Drop the gun Doctor Burns. - You're out of your mind. - No one is getting shot. - Move over, now! - I'm going to step forward now. - I'll shoot. (gunshot) What the? I knew this. - What did you know? - You wouldn't be hurt. - Why? - Blanks. (gunshot) - Excellent. - What is this? - You tell me, Doctor Burns. - I can't. - [Man] You can. You just have to try. You can drop the gun at any time Doctor Burns. It serves you no purpose. (static) Do you not remember, Doctor Burns? - I don't. - Tell me about January 11th, Doctor Burns. - It's only like January-- - January 3rd? I know. You've been saying that for the past four months. - What? (ominous music) Maddie! Maddie. Andrew. What is this? What is this? What is this? Andrew. What is this? - Doctor Burns. (suspenseful music) I apologize for all these precautions, but please try to stay calm, we haven't much time. - Much time? Andrew, what's he talking about? - Doctor Burns, in less than 30 minutes, this all will go away. As if it never happened. So I can't stress enough, every second counts. My name is Doctor Norman Atley, do you know me? (ticking) - No. - I'm your doctor, my dear. More than that, I'm your friend. These men on the floor, they're also your friends. Now listen, I need you to focus. - Andrew, what's happening? - Emmy, do what he says, please. - Doctor Burns, I need you to think about why you're here. The answer is in you, it always has been. You just need to find it. January 11th. January 11th. (screeching) (beeping) (garbled speech) - You name it. Okay, Tuesday. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right, yes, I promise you! You really need to work on expanding your horizons. - [Man] Repetition is something to be... (old-fashioned music) - [Emily] I'll find your target. - Jesus, I think you nailed it Emily. This is great. - I don't know, I think this looks really solid. I'm confident in taking it to the lab. - Oh my god. - What? - I have to make a call. - Everything all right? - Yeah, yeah, I just have to make a call. - Well fine, go ahead, use my line. I'm gonna take this down to the lab, get it prepped. - [Emily] Yeah, I'm just gonna be a couple of minutes late. (sighs) - [Andrew] You forgot, didn't you? - [Emily] No, of course not. I'm so sorry, I-- - [Andrew] Damn it, Em. - [Emily] Please, I will be there. - [Andrew] Whatever, forget it. - [Emily] Andrew. - [Andrew] Don't even bother. - [Emily] Andrew, please! Andrew please! Andrew! (explosion) - [Andrew] Emmy? Emmy? Emily! - [Voiceover] If you're just joining us, where an explosion has lead to a devastating fire on the campus of Cortland College. (sirens) (fire crackling) - An explosion. - What else? You have to tell us what else you remember. - He didn't make it. - Who didn't make it? - David. - Excellent. - There was... blood and... fire. - We need to know what he was working with. What it was he was doing. - I don't remember. - Yes, exactly, and you were consulting on that with him. - Why? Why does any of this matter? - Because whatever it was, whatever he was working with, it's what did this to you. It's what produced this virus. - What virus? Andrew, what virus? - You tell us. You're the only one who can, Doctor Burns. I'm sorry, but without your knowledge of what kind of viral mutation could've taken place in this explosion, there's no hope of treating you. - I don't understand. - The marks on the back of your neck. Burst blood vessels. The stiffness, the headaches, the motor function issues, the loss of balance, hallucinations, retrograde amnesia. My dear, it's all from the inflammation of your brain. My dear, you have a pathogen inside you. A viral mutation that science has never seen up to this point. A viral mutation that was created in your laboratory, Doctor Burns, using your inventory. In the experiment that you consulted on with Doctor Cobb. Now, he's gone. So you're it. And each day we don't identify this pathogen, it will continue to eat away at your body and your mind. Take a moment to process all this, but let me stress again, time is very much of the essence here. A substantial amount of damage is being done on a daily basis to your brain's MTL. Gradually, you're losing the ability to create new memories. (solemn music) In less than 30 minutes, all of us will still be standing here the same, but for you, it'll be January 3rd all over again. We tried everything. Every test you can imagine. Every doctor, every medication. Herbal remedies, psychoanalysis, dream analysis. Nothing worked. - Doctor Burns you're suffering from post-traumatic amnesia and it's a malady I've treated many times in my career, but for the most severe of my patients, I provide this. An experimental, highly-invasive therapy. I subject the patient to a threatening scenario. This causes them to become overwhelmed with intense emotion. Then at the same time, I employ standard psychoanalytical techniques. Music, video, photographs. Newscasts, anything that can help us trick the amygdala, and help us pry loose those hidden memories. - [Amanda] It's true Emily. We're all here for you. - A complete and utter fabrication. Done only with your input, and the help of your family and your friends. - You made us swear not to get involved. I'm so sorry. - Now now, there's no need for any of us to be sorry, we're all in this together. For Emily. So, we'd like to welcome you to this, our fifth attempt. And I must say, we're making splendid progress. But, I need more. I need you to go deeper into that mind of yours Doctor Burns. And tell me everything, every thing, that you can about January 11th. I need to identify this pathogen, before it takes you over completely. - This can't be happening. - But it is. So think. Emily. (crying) - I don't know. - Honey, think. - [Emily] I don't know! I'm so sorry. I am. - I know. - Mommy. (crying) It's okay. - No it's not baby. It's gonna be okay, I'm gonna figure this out, okay? This is what I do. You hear me? I'm not going anywhere. - Look at the clock Doctor Burns. What is it you'd like to do? - You know damn well what I wanna do. (snaps) (footsteps) (grunting) (solemn music)
