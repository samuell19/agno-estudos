Now, relax. Relax all of your beautiful, over-worked, tired muscles. Listen only to the sound of my gorgeous voice. Now. Open your eyes. Now, I must have absolute silence. Shhh! Now, are you alive? Are you vital? Or are you a zombie? Or maybe a preening, pretty peacock? Only moments away - From death! Hey! All right! And that, ladies and gentleman, is what we call the power of suggestion. And now I suggest that all y'all hoes tip me, OK? And let's get a drink cause hypnosis will wear a bitch out. C'mon baby. What are you doing here? Happy Birthday. Hey. How are you? Hi. How are you? Cheers! Dusty, this is such an awesome party. That show was so great. It's good to see you. Did you lock that door? Yeah. What's the point? It's not like we're going to... Oh. With all our guests? In the house? I love you, Tiger. It's your birthday... but we both get a present. Stephen, your house looks amazing. I love what you guys have done with the place. Life or death! Dusty. I thought this was a cocktail party. Oh, come on, what's a part without a little bit of drama. To drama. It's only fun when it's not happening to you. Dusty. Hello! Amanda. Looking gorgeous as always. Have you been working out? No, no. Not really. You're looking good. Oh, thanks. See you. Cheers. What? Oh, no, no. You do not think that our therapist is hitting on me. Is that unthinkable? Yes, it is. Even though every guy in LA is after you, I'm great. Still single. Jeffrey, I need to speak with you. As your friend or your therapist? Craigery is here. I thought you were over him. I am charging you for this conversation. I don't care. I need your advice. Happy Birthday, Stephen. Thank you. I knew you'd come looking for me. Craigery. Come on. You could at least tell me I look good. You look good. Oh, hey - Stephen is going to make me the host of his new reality show. So not only did I introduce you to the hottest man in LA, but he's making you a TV star? Yeah. Oh, what the hell is he doing here? Craigery. Yeah. Not invited. Dusty. Great party. But - We totally don't want to be rude - Right, we would never be rude. Ever. Because we love you. It's the drag queen. Jasmine? Darling. Loved the hypnotist. You must give me her number. Of course. Why is a dude in a dress so endlessly hilarious? What is the funny? Is it the heels? Is it the makeup? Is it because it's a dude? We're women. We have real boobs. I miss you. You used to call me Tiger. I want you to call me that again. Well, things have changed. And Dusty's going to be wondering where I am. Think about how much hotter that would make it. Hey. Whoa. I can't stay. Look who texted me back. I want him to do things to me it will take me years of therapy to get over. OK, you're wasted. Let's get you a cab. No, no, no. I'm fine. It's just my allergies. He's so hot. Well, how about some coffee? That's hot, too. I never said that I would leave him. That's not how I remember it. I'm in love with Dusty. And he's using you like a cheap whore. Listen to me. I used to be in love with you. But that's all over now. But that's not fair. Well, that's not my problem. But I still love you. Don't do this, Stephen. Don't throw us away. Still on the baby-daddy hunt? Not at this party. Surrounded by the best DNA on Earth. They don't even see me. It's called West Hollywood. Really? You're not just telling me that? No. This is my business. It has nothing to do with our past. You're good. You're good. Oh, god. Oh, god. I can't tell you how happy you've made me. Hey. What are you doing? Thanking you. Dusty. Dusty. There you are. We're doing the cake. You remember Craigery? Yeah. You're kind of unforgettable. Guess what? I'm going to host Stephen's new reality show! I knew you'd be disappointed, and I'm sorry. There will be other shows. One you're more right for. You said I was right for this show. You were. You are. You're so talented. I mean, look at this party. You're amazing. Yeah, great. I'm such a good little housewife. You're not my wife. Look. You know how I am. I'm not perfect. Far from it. And... And? And recently I've made some decisions. And the thing is, that I want - More than anything - To spend my life with you. Is that what I think it is? Is that a yes? Yes. Yes. Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes. That's - That's a yes. I love you. I love you too, Tiger. Those are for Dusty. Dusty. Your handcuffs. This one's from me. Wow. That's fantastic. Oh. Cute. You like it? I love it. I love it. I'm glad. All right, get a room, bitches. OK. All right. This one. This one is from - Craigery. Wow. So cool. Thanks. That's strange. He got you a tiger. Hey. Listen... This is why he got the job, isn't it? No, no. Hey. Let's go upstairs. We can talk about this. I don't want to go upstairs and talk about this. Move. Hey! Listen! I can explain. Move. No. Move! I could fucking kill you! Dusty? What can I say? I'm attracted to the over-emotional poor. Hey. Look. I know I'm a total dick but can we at least talk about this? Why talk? You're right. You are a total dick. Dusty, come on. Let me explain. Go fuck yourself! Whoa. Shit is going down. Seriously, It's like backstage at the Tony's here. I gotta go. Jesus. Let's go outside. Fighting in a Pink Dot is not really my thing. Yeah, we know what your thing is. And now so do all of our friends. What? You out of tequila? Only that very expensive gay brand. Then just give me whatever. Look, I'm sorry. It's over between us. What? It's over. Yeah, Stephen. It is. I love you, Tiger. I want more than anything... That's a yes. I love you. Hi there. I'm Dr. Winters. How are you doing? I... There was an incident. You're at Cedars. But you're going to be OK. Dusty? Sweetie? How are you feeling? I'm at the hospital? You were shot. What? Just your right arm. It's healing already. I'm more concerned about the injury to your head. You have a pretty serious concussion. Hey, sweetie. Do you remember what happened? Just... that... the party... at the house. Then you went to Pink Dot, remember? And you and Stephen got attacked. What? Where is he? I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm so sorry. Stephen? Stephen. God. Oh, my god. Jesus. Oh, Jesus. There are some police and they wanna speak with you, but I can send them away. No, I want to talk to them. OK. Would you give us a moment? I'll check on you in a bit. I'm his lawyer. Mr. Young. I'm LAPD Detective Annette Riley. This is my partner, Detective Noah Santos. Do you remember what happened? Not clearly, no. We're going to need you to tell us everything. It was Stephen's birthday. And then we had people over and... Then I... Two nights ago at 11:30 PM, an armed robbery occurred at Pink Dot, 8495 Sunset Blvd. An unknown masked perpetrator shot out security cameras, stealing a 134 dollars and change. Three victims sustained ballistic trauma, including yourself. And two fatalities; the clerk, a Kevin Kyle Dawson and - Your boyfriend, Stephen Phillip Redding. I know this isn't the best time but we need as much... Detective. OK. Thank you. We're going to find whoever did this. That's a promise. I love you, sweetie. I love you so much. There's no way this guy killed him. Why, because he's wearing that ring? No, his eyes. He's not a killer. You saw that crime scene. That was rage. And I don't mean the nightclub. Thirteen years on the job, one thing's certain - it's always the spouse. You don't date much, do you? Not men. Well, don't look at me. Neither do I. The lord is my shepherd I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures... Check this out. What the hell's he doing here? I've got it. Come on, this is not the time for this... That is bullshit! I have as much right as anyone. Excuse me! This is a private affair. I'll just take a second. Please. I loved him! And like it or not - He loved me, too. Unbelievable. Yeah. Real housewives of West Hollywood. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. If there's anything I can do for you, my son. Hey. We're so, so sorry. How are you holding up? Is that a professional question? It's a compassionate one. My entire life just fell apart. It's going to take some time. And I kind of feel like... I'm falling apart, too. You know I'm here for you, right? But if you prefer I can get you a referral. I am so, so sorry. What, are you out of tequila? Only that very expensive gay brand. Well then give me anything. Look. I'm sorry. It's over between us. What? It's over. Yeah, Stephen. It is. Dusty, Dusty. What are you doing? That's great, you got him on tape. You OK? He was talking about Craigery. You thought he was breaking up with you? I... He doesn't remember anything. Find that guy in the mask. Yeah, we're working on it. But we're also not ruling anyone out. You don't think I had anything to do with this, do you? A random gunman just happens to show up, the night you're mad as hell at him? That's convenient. Well, it is called a convenience store. Obviously, the man in the mask shooting the gun is the killer. But how do you know, I mean. You don't remember, right? Anything's possible. OK. Get this. That robber. He's wearing gloves. The gun that shot Stephen gave us high quality prints. Well, that's great, right? We'll let you know... Once you give us yours. What can I say, I like sex. I fucking love it. I can't help it. I mean, these guys. They throw themselves at me. You wouldn't turn them down. You couldn't. No one could. I can't... I don't want to compete. But yet, you've used the word addiction? Addiction. Hobby. What's the difference? Well. An addiction gets in the way of other things. Your career. Family. Love. Love... That's the question. I love you, Stephen. But you love me, right? Stephen? Isn't it about time you made up your mind? Yeah. And my choice is... Wait Stephen. Choose me! Choose me! Tell us about their relationship. It was good. Very good. They were even in therapy together. Like any healthy couple in love. We are Stephen's production managers. We were. Until recently, when we were put on hold. Without pay. He was retooling one of his shows. We have a mortgage, bills, cats. But we love Stephen, so we really want to be discrete. But let's face it. Gay men... It's not like they were monogamous. Like us. Now I'm not one to speak ill of the dead, but Stephen - Stephen was a selfish, manipulative user. Bless his heart. He took what he wanted when he wanted it. Men. Drugs. Sex. If I weren't totally jealous, I would be thoroughly disgusted. Yes, Stephen was a client before I started seeing them as a couple. Rules with respect to doctor-patient confidentiality still apply now. But I will say - This senseless violence is a challenge for all of us. So if either of you ever want to talk then - I'm available. Sorry, allergies. But no, Dusty could never kill anybody. Take that night. He was pissed off, freaked out- I'll just say it- beyond the point of no return. And what does he do? He leaves. As of for Stephen being brutally gunned down - Well, it's just a crazy terrible ironic coincidence. And they were devoted to each other. I mean, I would know. I was their lawyer. But love and sex for gays, it's complicated. As for Dusty... Stephen was the love of his life. He was everything to him. I was so very happy for them both. No, I'm not desperate. Stephen and I are the kind of guys who... We've got choices. A lot of choices. But what really got under Dusty's hide was that Stephen wanted me. And not just sexually. Dusty couldn't handle that so he killed him. Is that what you think happened? I told you. I don't know. I don't remember. Let's just cut the crap. You were mad at him. Humiliated - And even if the robbery was a coincidence, you found a gun in your hand and you gave him what he had coming. No! No. I mean yes, I was mad. I was hurt. But I didn't kill him. Really? Because forensics got back to us - And the clerk's .38 special. Your prints. No, that's impossible. My client was unconscious. A gun could have been placed in his hands. What about that robber? What about the gunpowder? And, and the blood. My client was shot. Stephen's blood. No, no, no. I'm not capable. Yes, you are. And at this time we're placing you under arrest for murder of Stephan Reading. Don't worry. I'll post bail. Don't say anything, OK? You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford an attorney... I'm not going to force you to talk about your father. Unless you want to talk about your father. Do you want to talk about your father? The night Stephen died. I don't remember it. Well, in moments of trauma, people tend to shut down, black out. And I was just arrested for his murder. Sorry. Um... excuse me. I'm out on bail. I have to figure this out. Or I don't have a chance. All right. Why don't... Why don't we talk about Stephen. Should we talk about him? Yeah, I guess so. As you know, he had a thing for Craigery. I'm not sure if you know that - Last year... we had a three way with him. And how was that? It was hot. It was really hot. At first... But then. But then Stephen liked Craigery. Like he really liked him. Right in front of me. That must have been a challenge. I freaked out. I acted like a total dick. But I had to do something. I have never seen him act that way with anyone else. I miss him. He made me know who I am. And what everything's about. He walked into that dinner party and we smiled at each other and - That was it. We were in love. Oh, fuck. I still don't understand why you don't want me to call the police. And tell them what? That you were just attacked but you didn't set your alarm? Well. It's the truth. Honey. Oh, my god. Fuck. What is it? Nothing. Let's just... let's just clean up. But you're OK, right? Yeah. I'm fine. This just isn't the time. Amanda. Amanda. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Sit. Sorry. To be the future father of my yet-to-be-conceived baby. He just texted me his answer. Oh. Oh, sweetie, I am so sorry. No. This really isn't the time. Listen... Look... When you came to Stephen and I. We talked about it, deeply, and he just... I know. And I'm sorry. I'm not bringing this up right now. I'm not. Even though you'd make a great dad. I'm sorry he said no. But I'm glad you're not bringing it up right now. Thanks, honey. I just started my cycle, so - We - or I - still have a month to decide. You know we love you, Dusty. Both of us do. And we don't want to be rude, but... It's your shrink. We really think you should be seeing someone else. I like Jeffrey. He was Stephen's therapist. Ours is brilliant. Besides, everyone knows lesbians make the best shrinks. We'll email you our list. Just our top ten. Hey. Oh! Girls. You know, I resent that. And I resent you. Honey, you don't resent me. You resent yourself, OK? And as a matter of fact I have a therapist I would love to recommend to you. She's lesbian. What the hell are you trying to say to me? I think I was saying what I was trying to say to you. Guys! Guys! Come on. Tonight's supposed to be fun. Dusty, we love you. We're leaving. Right. Because we, are all about love. Oh. No, she didn't. Girl, they better be happy I'm on probation. Here baby. They mean well. They do. Please. They're like fairy godmothers. With strap-ons. Big old strap-ons! Shots! Yes! What'd I miss? If I missed something good again, you have to tell me. Oh honey calm down, you didn't miss anything. Listen, after all you've been through, baby - You need to have a night without all this foolishness and clown-fuckery, OK? You need a good night. And that night starts right now! ♪ Tonight you're feeling curious. ♪ ♪ You show up looking mysterious. ♪ ♪ I get the feeling that something's going on ♪ ♪ For you tell me that nothing is wrong ♪ ♪ The look in your eyes is serious... ♪ Here. Try some of this. Are you... You're not dealing again? If I was, you'd be paying for it. ♪ Kiss me. Kiss me, kill me... ♪ Yeah? Oh, yeah... Oh, fuck yeah. Travis... ♪ Kiss me... What? Dusty? Hey. What? You OK? Evening gents. How about some shots? ♪ I feel so sexy today ♪ I like to feel like this everyday. All day. ♪ ♪ I feel you're complexion perfection ♪ ♪ I love the attention, you know I love it. ♪ ♪ Sex sells. Sex sells. ♪ Sex sells. ♪ Sex sells. Doesn't look like he's in mourning to me. I wouldn't say that. He is wearing black. Oh, yeah. You're so hot. Really? Then don't blame Stephen. What? What the fuck? See? You're into me, too. All right, buddy. Party's over. Hey. You OK? What the hell happened? If I told you, you wouldn't believe me. What'd you do, kill somebody else? No, but I could have. I'm still having nightmares. Feel like describing one? You know, maybe we should discuss your parents. Were you close to your father? The dreams are about the Pink Dot. And I'm sure they're painful. But remembering them, might help trigger more of your memories. You know, now might not be a bad time for hypnosis. Seriously? Yeah. It will just strip away the wall - The defense mechanism your subconscious has created, allowing you to focus. Or another option is, that we could both together go to the Pink Dot. Let's try the hypnosis. OK Dusty, I need for you to relax. OK, put your arms down by your side and breathe. Yeah. Now imagine you're walking down a long, dark hallway. There's a staircase. Take the stairs all the way down to the bottom. There, you see a door. It looks like the door to the Pink Dot, but it's not. It's a door to your subconscious. Open the door... and step inside. Tequila. But he doesn't give me tequila. And what does he give you? A gun. You know what to do with that. Hi there. Dusty. I know I'm not perfect. Not even close. And you make such a great housewife. Besides... Craigery's just so perfect for this show. Stephen! OK. Enough. Stop it right now. Please. Stephen! Baby! Fuck you. You're all right. Here drink this. Stephen shot me. Why would he shoot me? One possibility is that you're dealing with the guilt. I'm not saying you're guilty, just that you're feeling that way. About what? I don't know. Surviving perhaps? As executor of Stephen's will, it's my job to manage his assets with respect to his last wishes. But essentially, you're the sole beneficiary. Which means I get? Everything. You're kidding? No, and there are a couple of issues. First this does provide a pretty significant motive. Motive? Like I was after his money? I didn't even know about that. I don't want it. It will be a matter of public record. How much are we talking about? Life insurance, liquid assets, the investments, house, TV royalties - His net worth is in the neighborhood of twelve million. Twelve million dollars? I knew he was successful but holy shit. He was rich. The second, and probably more sensitive issue, involves Craigery. Excuse me? Last year, Stephen bought him a condo. Now, this condo... Wait. Wait. Wait. You knew about this? I was his lawyer. It was privileged. Even from me. Craigery's been making payments. Stephen did intend to transfer title. As of now it's still in Stephen's name but you really should honor the spirit of the agreement. What's the address? Dusty. I heard about this place. I wanted to take a look at it. I'm paying for it. Yeah, I guess we both are. What's your deal? My deal is that Stephen was killed and I didn't have anything to do with it. Do you think I did? I wouldn't put anything past you. Look at you. Grieving widow. Do you think Jackie O. worked out her issues in a bathroom stall? You don't know the first thing about me. I know you're in mourning. I know you're devastated. And yet, you still managed to suck my face. So this little property of yours... It is mine. I'm making payments. Payments to the owner. I think that's what's called rent. No, Stephen was going to... What? Well he certainly wasn't going to give you a condo. Actually, he was. Oh. Do you have that in writing? I'll have to check. Yeah, you do that. I'll be in touch. Bitch. Oh and while you're at it, you might want to look for a new place to live. You think you can evict me? Stephen left me the condo. So? So that means I'm your new landlord. You have a month to vacate the premises. And trust me, that you'll get in writing. Jesus. Why can't gays ever just get along? What the hell was that, a smackdown or a seduction? In this town, what makes you think it wasn't both? Hello? Jeffrey, good. Are you free? Yes. Is something wrong? Are you OK? I want to remember. I want to know what happened. Now. OK, Dusty. We're going to go back to the Pink Dot. I know it's scary, but this time it's OK. You're safe. A total dick. Hey. Look. OK. Just slow down. There's no need to rush. I'm here with you. Now tell me - what's happening? Stephen comes in. Hey. Look. I know I'm a total dick, but can we at least just talk about this? OK. Now what? He says... I'm sorry. It's over between us. But I misunderstand and I say... Yeah, Stephen. It is. And then what? Then it happens. Dusty! Dusty! What are you doing? Jesus. Holy mother of shit! Get up! Now! You OK? You. Over there! Baby! No talking. Hey. Relax. Take it easy. Oh, are you two a couple? You're together? Boy, isn't that sweet. Just tell us what you want. Stop touching me! Fuck! You better get over there now! Open that. Now! You know, please would go a long way. Put it in a bag. All of it. Now. And your wallet. And that expensive fucking watch. OK. OK. We don't want any trouble. Oh, really? Well, that's going to be a problem. Because I am trouble. How much do you make? I do all right. This isn't a trick fucking question. How much? Last year... mid six figures. Wow. In this economy? Yeah. It's not bad. Dude, here's your money. You're welcome. All this money. It's just an illusion. Because you can't spend it when you're dead. Stop! Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm so sorry. That should never have happened. Everything's fine. Right? I don't think I should treat you anymore. Seriously? Over a kiss? You're in process. You're vulnerable. You reached out to me. Look - I'm trying very hard to keep professional right now. Yeah, but what about what I want? There are rules, Dusty. Well, I know, but... I just lost Stephen and we're finally starting to make some progress. And... Look. I don't think I should be your therapist anymore. All right. It's for the best, really. Fine. Whatever. I'll get you a referral. Oh, great. Thank you so much. Wait. Wait. That means from this moment on our professional relationship has ended. I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't. Someone's here. Of course. False alarm. What are you doing here? Hey. Uh. It's good. You're awake. I, uh... You know that new nasty, trashy club that I would never be caught dead in? You are coming with me tonight. My therapist is here. It's a long story. Hey... Are you wasted on a school night? No, it's my goddamned allergies. It's totally fine, unless I want to see, or speak, or breathe. I'm going to head down and get an Uber. No, no. Hey. Stop! You're sleeping on the couch. Oh, Dusty! You know, I love you, right? I know. I know. I love you, too. OK. Come on. Get it together. I'm fine. I'm fine. It's OK. Travis was... I just texted you. Dr. Robin Revkin. She's good. She's a lesbian. Thanks. Oops. Klutz. Well, this is nice. Yes. Hey... I'm sorry... I just don't know if I'm ready for all this. It's a little bit weird. I barely know you. That's... understandable. I mean... But let's change that. I'm originally from the Midlands. Which is about two hours north of London. I lost both my parents in a car accident when I was eighteen. Oh my God! I was pretty devastated. But I used the settlement to come out to Hollywood and be the next Tom Cruise. But clearly that didn't pan out. I mean with me being English and gay and all. Well... English. So I decided to become a psychologist. I had two fairly long-term relationships. Then more recently I met someone quite special but... This town has a habit of keeping people apart. But I feel... I'm finally ready to let that go. You know what they don't tell you at the Academy? You gotta spend a lot of time photographing naked men. Aren't there ever two women? You wanna see two women go to Long Beach. This is West Hollywood. So always men? And they are always guilty. And they are always naked. So tell me more about you. Well I'm an only child. My father raised me and he had always wanted a son. Once - oh God - when I was fifteen - We went camping. There was this really hot boy at the campsite right next to ours - And he was friendly. Very... very friendly. So one day we decided to take a hike. We thought we were alone, but my father walked up on us. Oh my God. What were you doing? Well we still had some clothes on. Thank God. Then he called me a faggot - And packed everything up and left without me. When I finally made it home - We never talked about it. I don't think he ever forgave me. What are you doing? He saw you didn't he? Yeah. He might not have talked about it, but he knew - Who his son was. And what his son was. And that is - Beautiful. Craigery would like to know what you think is fair. Fair? It's my boyfriend's condo. Why should that go to you? You want me to say it? OK. He choose you. Was I happy about it? No. Did it break my freaking heart? Yeah it did. Well that's a very sad story but I don't see the connection to real estate. The connection is that Stephen intended for... Oh my God! Hey what's up? Lori. Daniele. You remember Amanda. Hi. That is Craigery. Oh yeah! You're the one who gave Stephen the crystal tiger. Which caused their fight and why they ended up at the Pink Dot. Where Stephen was shot. To death. What the fuck? You know what Dusty? If you need us, we're going to be right over there. - With our eyes on you! - You. They're so sweet. Like Seal Team Six. So... You were saying? Craigery is prepared to pay back Stephen's down payment. I'm not such a bad guy. Can we just do this? Ethically the condo should go to him. And you thought it was in the will? No of course not. Even if I did I was wrong. Well if he thought - That's a motive, isn't it? Dusty - Stephen loved us both. You were just better at manipulating him and that's all. Craigery! Yeah Craigery! What kind of bullshit gay ass name is Craigery anyway? My mother named me that. Oh really? Was she a drag queen? Hey you know what? Fuck you! You know what? Both of you - stop it. Stephen choose me. Me. That's why he left me everything and you nothing. If you ask me that gives you a motive. No, actually that gives you a motive. You know what? You're right. And seeing that I'm already up on one murder charge - You probably shouldn't piss me off. It's a client. I gotta take this. Look through the menus and we'll order in. Hello! Holy shit. Sorry. Clients - it's never ending. Alright. What's wrong? Why is there a gun in your bag? And what's with this Pink Dot menu? You even circled the time it closes. Yeah, they are in the neighborhood. They deliver. You don't think I have anything to do... I don't know what to think anymore. Whoa! Jeffrey! It's not loaded. Look! I just got it yesterday. Here's... Hold that. Here... Is the permit. Oh... Yesterday. That night scared the hell out of me too. Look, I'm so sorry. I just... I guess I'm just still really freaked out. Well I got it to protect us. Protect us both. We just heard back from the D.A. but before I get to that... We got a question for you. You just watched your boyfriend get gunned down. Brutally. A terrible ordeal for anyone. And what do you do? You start seeing someone new. Oh god, I love that photography. Oh wow. Where did you get these? Practically Annie Leibovitz here. What the hell is this? That is tender. Just getting our case against you. I wonder what the jury will think? This is harassment. God dammit, do I have to get the D.A. in here? Let's wrap this up. For what you did - you should get life. But we're going to do you a favor. Second degree murder. Seven years. Good conduct you're out in four. Four years? You don't have to answer this now. That's not bad for a killer. Wait? If you guys have all this evidence, then why are you so willing to negotiate? Sweetie, it's called a plea bargain. I know what it's called. OK. I don't remember what happened that night, but I know one thing - I am innocent. So if you think I'm guilty - You're going to have to try me and convict me. Are you sure you wanna do that? Absolutely. Shit! Alright look - Stephen was shot twice. Two guns. Two bullets. First a .38 Special. That was the clerk's. Second, much bigger. A .45 Long Colt. So? And that means? So the second bullet... It means the second bullet destroyed the damage from the first. Oh God... Ballistics can't tell which bullet killed him? Physical evidence aside - you had motive, means, and opportunity. You did this. Wait, wait... What does this mean for me? It means the D.A. is dropping the charges. But in my thirteen years on the job, I've developed a sense about these things. We may not be able to prove it - But this isn't over. And you two can go fuck yourselves. Well. Hey! They dropped the charges. Well that's great! No, they still think that I did it. It's just that their case fell apart. Well what do you think? I don't know. I think I might have done it. Don't be silly. Of course you didn't. Oh come on. Who the hell am I kidding? I probably did do it. I was just lucky enough to get away with it. What are you doing? Making us cocktails. God knows I could do with one. I don't want a cocktail, Jeffrey. I want to remember everything. I want you to hypnotize me again. No. You're in no fit state for hypnosis. Why the hell not? Well look at you. You're all keyed up. Hypnosis only works when you're relaxed. You call this relaxed? Yes. No. Jesus! What the... Alright bitch! Your turn! No Dusty! Please! No! We're here live in West Hollywood, where last night an aspiring actor was the victim - Of a grisly act of violence. The victim, Craigery Paul Webb, was pronounced dead on the scene. Stabbed over two dozen times. This is an active crime scene. I'm the... I'm his landlord. Travis? Dusty. What the fuck are you doing here? I was just leaving. Travis - wait! No Dusty! Please! Oh shit. Riley! Dusty. Excuse us. Shit. That's OK. We know where to find him. Craigery is dead. What? Oh my God. Someone broke into his condo last night and stabbed him. And I think it was me. You? That's not... That's impossible. No, no, I had another nightmare. And it was awful. It was so real. It was like I was there. And then - I watched the news this morning and it's just like I remembered it, and I really think... Wait a minute, OK? It was all just a dream. But then I found the blood. And the knife. And I really think I did it. Oh my God! No, no. Calm down OK? Let's look at the facts. The facts. Craigery was killed. He was stabbed. And I found the knife. Yes and you were with me all night last night. You never left. Is there a way that I could have without you noticing? I really don't know... I mean - I guess you could have gone there and made it back in time. How is this happening? Why is this happening? I don't know. You are dealing with a tremendous amount of unresolved guilt. Yeah, you think? I fucking killed someone! Listen to me - I'm not saying that you consciously did this but... It sounds like you blacked out again and I don't know, something else took over you. And - for lack of a better word - acted. Well then, what do I do? I don't know... I guess we should ask your lawyer. Are you fucking kidding me? Well the fact that he remembers his actions like a dream is remarkable really. You really think you killed him? Yes. How could that be possible? I don't know. But it is. Well I hate to say this but you might wanna consider... What? Turn myself in? No, no, no. Absolutely not. There has to be some other option... Well frankly I don't think any jury is ever going to buy this. I'm not even sure if I do. Well what if I tell the police the truth. I mean everything. Then... Then there will be consequences. So before you do anything, you better be damned sure that you did this. Well that was one hell of a story but not exactly a surprise - Seeing that you have done this sort of thing before. You have the murder weapon? Yeah. It's in my car. And I saw the guy from Pink Dot. He was outside the condo. And you just happened to see him today? He was on the street. I tried chasing him but he got away. What kind of car was it? It was older. A Toyota, I think. California plates. 5PV. Or maybe 6PV. Something like that. I don't remember. You don't remember very much, do you? But what gets me is... Why only confess to this crime? How many times do I have to tell you? I didn't kill Stephen. Oh, yeah right. So, we got a call, big surprise, that you threatened this victim too. Really? I did? We love Dusty. He's a dear, dear friend. And we really hate saying this... We really hate it. But we had to come forward. Dusty did threatened Craigery. He threatened to kill him. To death. And what's your business with the victim, Craigery? Me? This investigation isn't about me. Well, we just thought you might want to clear up a few things - Like weekly deposits from your law firm into his checking account. Well he does business for us. A gay go-go boy? My relationship to the victim is privileged. Besides Dusty just admitted that he killed him, so what's the problem? Good point. See? Lawyers. Smart. And fashionable. What? Can I use the bathroom? You know what? I'll just wait for you outside. Hello? Dusty you OK? Riley - he escaped! What the hell are you saying? I know. I know. I'm sorry. Oh honey I still cannot believe that Stephen is gone. Craigery on the other hand, I will not miss. Get that for me. I need to remember a license plate. Do you think you can hypnotize me? I could. But you don't need to be hypnotized for that. Baby you just need to focus. Concentrate. Well then how come I still can't remember the night Stephen died? Cause you haven't forgiven yourself. For what? I guess we're about to find out. 5PVZ523. Now. I know this is hard, but we can do this. Let's go back to that night... The night Stephen died. You OK, honey? Yeah. I think so. Good. This time if anyone tries to mess with you. They going to first deal with me, OK? And you're going to remember everything. So the clerk, he's over there. And Stephen is here too. And there's someone else here. What's he doing? He is forcing me to the floor. Get over there! Now! And now? He's making the clerk give him the money. You open that! Now! You see the gun? Yeah. What's happening now? I'm afraid, but I pick it up. Stop! Oh my God! I'm sorry. I love you. Fuck you. What the hell? No! Dude don't... Fuck! No. Stephen. Come on. Pace yourself honey. Deep breaths, alright. You're back here with me. You're with the living. Now... wake up! I didn't do it. I didn't kill him. Oh Stephen. Oh my God, Stephen. He saved me. He saved me. Fucked up he was, but he loved you. Yeah. He did. Travis? What the fuck? Why were you at Craigery's condo? Did you kill him? What? Or Stephen. Why were you at Albert Lunty's house? OK. Alright. Calm down. Albert's a customer. A customer? You're dealing again? Jesus. It's why I was at Craigery's. What were you doing there? Me? Fuck you, you fucking drug dealer. I know. I'm sorry. I'm stopping, OK? Done. Why are you so pissed? Is it because I fucked up your place? My place? That was you? I tried to be careful but I ended up trashing it. I know. I'm sorry. I really needed the shit that I sold Stephen. I couldn't find it so I went back to... Travis! Listen to me Travis - Albert killed Stephen. Your fucking customer killed my boyfriend. Oh my God. Are you sure? I was just there. Albert's dead. Your fucking eyedrops - right next to his corpse. I didn't know. I'm sorry. How did you meet him? How did you meet Albert Lunty? I met him through a friend. Which friend? Jeffrey Kinlan. What? You know - the therapist. Don't ever talk to me again. Dusty you don't mean that. I didn't know! I swear. You gotta belive me. I didn't know. Don't go! Hello? Dusty, I'm so sorry. Stephen just didn't want you to know about Cragiery's allowance. I don't give a shit about that. Listen, I think Jeffrey had Stephen killed. Jeffrey? What are you talking about? I tracked down the killer. He's dead now, but Travis was his dealer - Who he met through Jeffrey. Wait, wait. Slow down! I'm headed home. Meet me there. I'll explain everything. Hey Dusty sweetie... There is something I have to tell you. What? What is it Amanda? It's just that... I love you. Good. I love you, too. Bye. Riley, I got a 20 on suspect. He's returned to Sierra Mar house, 1018. It's Dusty. Now he's toying with us. Jesus! Amanda you scared the shit out of me. Sorry, honey. Come on. I'm naked. No. You don't have to do that. Yes I do. What the hell are you doing? Come on! It was Stephen. He was the one who didn't want this. He was the one who didn't approve of us. No. It wasn't just him. It was... You know now that he's gone - Let's make a baby. Amanda, what the fuck? Stop. Come on! We used to do it all the time. Remember? Before you were gay. Yeah. That was a long time ago. Jesus Amanda. Look. Back up! I've been moody lately. And I just haven't been myself. But it's not me - It's these goddamned fucking fertility drugs! But come on. Baby please. Let's make love... Please now. I'm ovulating. You're what? Jesus! You could have killed her. I do hope she is OK. Shall we call an ambulance? What the fuck is wrong with you? Me? There's nothing wrong with me. This city is a jungle. And like a jungle, those who betray us - Are sometimes better off dead. Craigery? But you didn't even know... Holy shit... This was all about Craigery? He was mine! I love you. I don't think you heard what I said... I said... I... I care about you too... My God. This is about someone else, isn't it? It is. I'm sick to death hearing about Stephen Redding. You know what Stephen means to me. Jesus. A great guy is out there for you. He is. Maybe another therapist - Maybe someone your own age... Don't you mock me. Especially about Stephen Redding. Jeffrey don't look at me like that. Stop it! You're freaking me out. It's alright. There's no need to be afraid. Everything's going to be just fine. And you had Stephen killed because he was your competition? Albert was supposed to take care of him, and you too probably, after the party. But I left. We both left. Stupid fucking Albert followed you. And then what happened? Let me guess? Craigery still didn't want you. He was a fool. I'll miss him. Deeply. Setting you up for his murder was my greatest challenge. No but... But I dreamt that I... You dreamt what I hypnotized you to dream. But I just fucking confessed to his murder! That was the idea. Fuck you! You disappoint me Dusty. Just like you did your father! Everything comes so easy for you doesn't it? House in the hills. Money. Men. Failed actor. Fucked up shrink. Don't come any closer or I'll shoot. Serves you right, bitch! Amanda. 911? Yes I'm being attacked. And I need an ambulance. I'm sorry my son must have misdialed. Yes we're fine. Everything is perfect. Now Dusty. What are you going to do with that? Back up! You don't know what I can do. No. You don't know what I'm capable of. You can't just kill people when they disappoint you. Really? You should tell my parents that! You're sick. You need help. So much pain. So much guilt. First you killed Stephen. Then Craigery. Then poor Albert. Then after you attacked me - You decided to end it all. Dusty, I'm coming in! Did you forget about the concert? Holy shit! Psycho! Nooo! Stop! Just stop it! Stephen took everything from me. No. This is on you. Either way - You're going to die! Let me guess - You don't remember killing this one either? I went a little fatal attraction on you. Sorry. You think? I love you Dusty. In a total platonic - I know I will never have you - and I'm totally OK with that - way. I love you. too. But do me a favor? Adopt. Looks like you're going to be OK. Finally some good news. A stabbing? Bitch, please. This is nothing. Dusty? I'm not in the habit of saying this but... In my 13 years on the job I've never been wrong. Until now. You take care of yourself. Thanks, Detective. So... since you're not a murderer or anything - I was wondering... sometime... if you want to... Get some coffee. Yeah... yeah I'd like that. Great. I will text you. OK. Are you fucking kidding us? Hey... Listen there is... Save it detective. Welcome to the family. Our team needs more men like you. We love you Dusty. We do. But next time you see a shink - See a lesbian! I'm Dusty's lawyer. I forgot something. It's cool. Oh sorry. I forgot my phone. There it is! You've reached Dr. Jeffrey Kinlan. Please leave a message. Double vodka. Straight up. Thank you. Drinking alone, Jeffrey? Oh Dusty. He's reckless. Not just with his own life. But with others too. Tell me about it. Dusty and I were going to get a kid together. And then I had to introduce him to Stephen. Freud said, the goal of all life, is death. My appointment is here. Jeffrey meet Albert. Hi. He's out on parole. Murder. Albert - So very nice to meet you. Jeffrey, you barely knew me. OK, Dusty - Looks like we're going to be parents after all.
