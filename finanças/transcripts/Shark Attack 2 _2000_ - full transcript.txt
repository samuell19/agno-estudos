Amy! Amy! Amy! Aah! Amy! Amy! No! Amy! Amy's dead! Oh, no! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! No! No! No! Man: that's good, right there. Man: a little more to the left. Man: the tank's about 3/4 full now. Walker. Sir? Where's nick? Huh. You mean marine boy. Where else? Thanks. Hey, morton. That window seems to be holding up all right. I'd like for you to keep an eye on it, though. Ok. No problem. Hi, michael. I just walked past the tropical tank, and guess what? It's completely empty. I know. I had to move everything until the heater was fixed properly. I thought it was fixed properly already. So did i. But the water's still 10 degrees too cold, and i didn't think you wanted an exhibit of dead fish. I've got exactly one week to iron everything out, nick, and i'm counting on you to make this work. Don't let me down. Well... there goes mr. Warmth. Mm-hmm. You said i could have a turn. When i'm done. When's that gonna be? When i'm done. But you said i could. Dad doesn't know we're using his boat. I don't want you breaking it. Aah! Aah! I heard about the shark in the inlet. Great white, huh? Yeah. You gonna tranquilize it? If i have to-- get it out of the inlet. That's perfect. Why don't you bring it in here? You're kidding, right? Not at all. Do you know what kind of media coverage we could get with a great white? Talk about a star attraction. Doesn't sound like one of your better ideas, michael. Could be great for you, too. You get to study it up close and personal. No one's ever been able to keep a great white alive in captivity. Monterey bay aquarium had one a couple years back. And if you remember, it couldn't adapt-- kept banging into walls. Had to let it go after a week. Yeah, but in that week, people were banging down the doors to get in and see it. Too risky. You've only been with us for 6 weeks, nick. And in that time, you've done a great job. But i'd hate to see you make a mistake now. That sounds like a threat, michael. Oh, you take it any way you like. I want that shark. First sign of trouble, we'll put him back in the ocean. Agreed? Agreed. You're the boss. Hey! What? Marcus. Hey, want some lotion? Yeah, ok. Marcus, shark. More beer, guys. What? Pay attention, please. What'd he say? Hey, mark. Mark. Mark. Huh? Hey, listen to me. Girl: thanks. Shark. In the inlet. Capturing a great white? Jesus! Next thing, francisco will have you out looking for moby dick. Don't fuck with me, mark. Are you guys available or not? Right now? Yes. These girls are babes. You're going to owe us big time. I'll double your normal rate. Double? Girls, gotta get to work. You guys are outta here. Ok, we're in. So, what's your plan? We'll bait 'im, drag him near the boat. I'll hit him with a tranquilizer dart, and we'll tow him in. It's a piece of cake. Jeez! Piece of cake, my ass. Looks like a 12-footer. No. This one's 16. Boys... i don't think he's happy. I can't see him. Careful! Shit! Uh! Got him. It's gonna take a few minutes to kick in. I don't know about you, but i could use a beer. And i think tom there could use a change of underwear. Eh! I hate you guys. Whew! In local news, we have a shark story about the big one that didn't get away. And this isn't just any shark, but rather a great white shark. Water world, cape town's new multimillion-dollar aquarium, will be the first of its kind to have an actual live great white shark on display to the public. Dr. Nick harris, water world's resident marine biologist, rescued a great white that was trapped in an inlet near hout bay. Oh, my god. The long-awaited aquarium opens it doors to the public on saturday. In soccer news, the springboks are scheduled to meet australia in-- woman: that shark's not supposed to be on display. It killed people. You don't keep it here for people to look at, ok? You need to take it out of the friggin' tank. You have a nice day, lady. Jerk. Ahem. Hmm. Who was that? Samantha peterson. She's convinced that our shark is the same one that killed her sister last week. The attack near table bay. Yeah. That's one crazy lady. You're not blaming her for being upset, are you, michael? No. So, how is our star attraction? He's good, but we're not out of the woods yet. Let's go take a look. Ok, kenny, turn them on half a watt. Half a watt comin' up. So what am i looking at? Those black boxes. They give off alternating electrical charges that the shark is attracted to. Gives him something to concentrate on and keeps him from banging his head into the wall. It's like dangling a carrot in front of a donkey. That's not bad. That's not bad at all. What's wrong? Look at the shark. Look at the shark? I've been looking at the shark for the past 2 days. I'm starting to see it in my sleep. I mean, lookat it, smart ass. His tail and his dorsal fin seem a little too big for his body. More like what you find in a newborn. Yeah, but that's no baby. At that size, he's got to be at least what, 10, 12 years old? I know. So the shark's a little off. My brother's head is way too big for his body, but he's normal. Well, sometimes anyway. Let's play it safe. Take a blood sample and run it through. Make sure our guy is healthy. Hmm. Hey! What are you trying to do? That thing murdered my sister. So you bring a shotgun in here to kill it. What would you do? You don't know this is the shark. Yes, i do. In case you didn't notice, doctor, it's missing an eye. I took it out... trying to save my sister's life. I know you want this to be the shark. That doesn't mean that it is. No one believes me. Why should you be any different? They said you're the one that brought it in here. I'd like to believe you, i really would. But without any proof, what am i supposed-- proof let's cut it open. I'll show you proof. You know i can't do that. I'm very sorry about what happened to your sister. I really am. And i understand what you must be going through. "Understand." You didn't see amy's eyes. You didn't see how that thing just tore her to pieces. You have no idea what i'm going through. Why don't you just go home. The shark is in the aquarium now. It's not gonna hurt anyone. I promise. Save your promises. Man: sharks really are not as dangerous as people think, as long as you don't antagonize them. Yeah? Excuse me, mayor shandu. What do you think of the new aquarium? I think water world will serve as a shining example of our city's dedication to education and the conservation of our seas. Now if you'll excuse me, mr. Francisco has promised me the grand tour. Come through this way. Come see the great white shark. Woman: that's 4.95. These are the brochures that will tell you all about it. Second woman: how much is that? First woman: that's 3.50. Right this way. Ladies and gentlemen, the great white shark. Nick: you see, the shark must swim constantly. If he were to stop, he'd sink. Any other questions? Yes, sir. How many different kinds of shark are there? There are over 360 varieties of shark-- from the tiniest cookie-cutter shark to the enormous whale shark. And of that number, only a very few pose any danger to man. Anyone else? Yes. Tell them to feed the shark. Shouldn't you ask harris? Harris is busy. The cameras are rolling. Let's give 'em something for the evening news. Kenny, you there? Come in, kenny. Kenny, you there? Are you there, kenny? Yes, i'm here. Feed the shark. Dr. Harris said to wait till after we're closed. Yes, and mr. Francisco is telling you to feed it. Now. Ok. Excuse me. What the hell are you doing? I'm giving them what they want. Aah! Aah! Morton. Hmm? We've got an emergency in the tank. Standing by, nick. Tell me what to do. Close the gate! Oh! Nick. Outta my way! The gate's not gonna hold, nick! What about tranquilizers? We're out. It's activated. Nick: do we have a signal? Yes. You got him. Mr. Francisco, now that a man-eating great white has escaped, what are you and your staff prepared to do about it? Well, first of all, i cannot begin to express my grief at what has happened here today. But let me assure you that we will do everything necessary to ensure your safety in these waters. Now if you'll excuse me. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. Francisco! Francisco! Francisco: security! Walker: all your questions will be answered. Harris. You fucked up real good. Do you know what a pr disaster this is? Kenny's dead, you son of a bitch. You brought it in here. That makes it your responsibility. In case you don't get it, you're fired. Chuck him outta here. Let's go. Let's go. And van hunks is just casually smoking away. And he says, "aagh! You've outsmoked the devil himself." So whenever we see that smoke coming off the mountain like that, we say, ah, van hunks is at it again. Huh. On me. Thanks, t.j. cheers. Nick. Why don't you just go home? Home. Home to what? Remember, nick. It's just a job. Right. Hold on. What do you want? Hi. I just-- i wanted-- what now you believe me about the shark. Someone else had to die, and now it's loose. If you hadn't have stopped me the other night, none of this would've happened. You're right. Look, i know what happened wasn't your fault, but now it's out there. What are you gonna do about it? Try to find it. And kill it? Yes, if i have to. Then you'll need some help. I'll get the miller brothers' boat. What time should i meet you? Oh... i don't think that would be a good idea. I can take care of myself. Yes, i know that. I just... with what happened, i don't think it'd be smart to have you out there. You know, i don't need you looking out for me. I... lend us a hand there, would you, mate? Here you go. Head's up. Nice boat. Oh, yeah. She's a beaut. All the way from sydney harbor. I'm roy. Roy bishop. I know. I've seen your show. It's very entertaining. Cartoon network, right? No. Discovery channel. Everyone recognizes me. We're the highest-rated animal show there is. And you're here doing some filming nearby? Actually, i was up near durban doing a show about the african octopus when i got a call about hunting down a great white. Now that's exciting. So, they said they could afford me, here i am. Thank you. That's all right. Hey, look after that. It's worth a lot of money. Good luck. Thanks, mate. Hey, tom. Hey, nick. Hey, mark. How are you? Hey, buddy. What are you doing here? I chartered this boat. Mark, god damn it! What's going on here? I need you guys today. Sorry, buddy. She booked us first. You should've called last night. I did call last night-- about 10 times. Your line was busy. Damn it, tom. I told you not to tie up the phone. Get your own line if you want to download porn all night. Hey, i wasn't on all night, man. All right. I'm sorry. Good. That's all i wanted to hear. You can tag along. Ican tag along? You kidding me? We can argue about this all day, or we can go find that shark. The choice is yours. Ok. We'll all go together, but, on the water, you listen to me. Please. Whatever you say, captain. Morton: hey, nick! Here i am. Nick! Thanks for coming down. Oh, no problem. Did you get it? Yes. Right here. Thank you. I'm expecting the results of the shark's blood sample sometime soon. All right. Let me know. Yes, but we'll have to do it on the sly. I've got francisco breathing down my neck. I thought i told you to take care of that filtration problem. Yes. They're busy fixing it right now. Yeah, but how the fuck do you know they're gonna fix it properly if you ain't there to supervise? See you later, nick. What's she doing here? She's with me. If you two think you're gonna catch that shark, you're way outta your league. We'll see. This is roy bishop. Yeah. We've met. He's been hired to clean up your mess. Fuck you, michael. This is your mess, and you know it. Hey, calm down, mate. Is this the bloke? Yeah. Ah, so you're the bozo who screwed things up by letting the shark get free. So, tell me--'cause i don't have your experience-- what's it like knowing that someone died because you fucked up? Michael, do me a favor. Get crocodile dundee outta my face. The mayor's behind me on this, nick. You just stay out of it. Come on, roy. Don't waste your time. You're a funny guy. Thank you. Very funny. Oh, and, uh... that's a nice boat. Which one of you guys dresses up as the indian? You're funny. I just wanna know. Pricks. Pretty much. We got something they don't. Oh, what's that? A global positioning device. Huh. I tagged the shark before he took off. Samantha: wow. When were you planning on telling them? Uh... i wasn't. Nick: there he is. Starboard--30 degrees. Samantha: looks like it's circling seal island. Turn port 25 degrees. And ease up on the throttle. Don't wanna spook him. Looks like we're right on top of it. There it is. Tom, let's go. Thomas, god damn it! Don't make me call your mother. Samantha: you guys be careful. He's circling under the boat. There he is. Here he comes. Nah! He didn't take it. Not this again! Shit! Son of a bitch! Get me the pole. You gonna put it to sleep? Yup. Whoa! Shit! Watch out. Sam, we're doing this my way. It looks like your way isn't working. Aah! Sam! Give me your hand! Grab it! Steady me! Nick! Steady me! Hold on to me! [Gasping for breath, coughing] he's moving! Well, let's go! Follow him. Shit. We're fucked! Shit! Can't you you do something? It's swimming away! No way we can fix her out here. Fuck! We should've had chuck do the tune-up. You said it could wait. Ah, yeah, well, blame it on me. Hey, bro, i'm just saying. Would you two cut it out? Jesus! Let's radio it in, guys. This is the wet dream calling cape harbor. Come in, cape harbor. Over. Dude, so i paddle out, i see this great wave. Well, well. Hi there, tough guy. What seems to be the problem? Rubber band break? We got a dinghy you can borrow. Roy: nah, we're just having a little fun with ya. Hey, hootie! Throw 'em a line. Newman. Get us straightened out. Aye, roy. Got it, tom? I got it. Tie it down. Clear the line. Roy: now i'll try to keep running at 10 knots. We don't want to scare ya. Ha ha ha ha! Next time. Thanks for pulling me out of the water. Hey, it's the least i could do after all the kindness you've shown me. You saved my life. I owe you one. I'm just glad you're ok. Amy! Amy... come in a little bit closer in there, hootie. That's it. Pierson, keep it open in there. Hey. Hey. When did he catch it? This morning, i guess. Is it our shark? I don't know. It's tough to tell. His head is all chewed up. It's the right size, and there's no tag. What we have here is a 12-foot great white shark. Now, i caught it just off the coast here in cape town, south africa. A menace to these waters, this man-eater attacked and killed at least 2 people. And that was before meetin' up with me. So... i was reeling him in when he tucked under the boat back to the stern. Then something wild happened. Bam! Ohh! Ohh! He hit the prop, sliced up his head, and chewed his fin. Right here. Before he could recover, he was sitting in the boat, right next to me. Oh, mr. Francisco, thank you. Ok. This can go like this. Roy: roy bishop caught the shark. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll come this way, i'll answer your questions. Ok, ladies and gentlemen. You want to step right up? Don't forget, you can see me on the discovery channel. Here, you'd like the hat? That's it. Feel free. Come on. Roy bishop's shark hangin' right here. Thanks to roy bishop, it is safe for our community to go back into the water again. Any other questions? Hi. Well, well, well. That's quite a story you told. Yeah, it's what they want. It spices up their boring little lives. It'll make a nice segment for your tv show. Only problem is i think you caught the wrong shark. It's a great white. About the same size, right? I caught it just offshore from the aquarium. I tagged the great white that escaped with the transmitter. Really? That little bit of information would have been helpful. You trying to hog all the glory for yourself, eh? This isn't a competition, roy. The losers always say that. Nick: what about the transmitter? I don't know. It could have fallen off when he hit the propeller or while i was reeling him in. Either way, i'll know for sure once we cut him open. And if it's not the right shark? Then i'll keep on catching him until i do find the right one. Hell, i might even get 3 or 4 episodes out of this. How could you take advantage of other people's miseries? Look here, you little beaut, i'm just here to help. But if it's good for my tv show, i'm gonna shoot it before somebody else steals it. Know what? You fix up your hair and face a little bit... i might even let you be on my show. Now excuse me. I've got to go sign some autographs. He talking to you or me? Hey, guys. Hey. See you're making some progress. Oh, yeah. Chuck here is deep into it. Bad news. It's gonna take me most of the day. Let us take her out tonight, then. I thought they caught the shark there. Not the right shark. Surfing competition's tomorrow. We can't spend all night cruising around. Yeah. Mark gets cranky if he doesn't get enough sleep. Shut up, tom. We want to have a look around seal island. Samantha and i can handle it. Ok. Thanks. Just try not to sink it. See ya. Huh. Asshole. Well, we've got some spare time. Oh, i got a great idea. ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ it was a big surprise ♪ oh, it was a new desire ♪ i can see it in your eyes ♪ ♪ ohh ♪ like a burnin' fire ♪ 'cause when i feel your touch ♪ ♪ it hurts to the bone ♪ it can never be too much ♪ 'cause i feel like i'm at home ♪ ♪ i know it's really happened fast ♪ ♪ let's see if we can make it last... ♪ is there anything i can say to make it easier? ♪ Oh, then let's forget the time... ♪ i just wish i could have said good-bye. ♪ And i'll dream you some truth ♪ ♪ ooh ooh ♪ ooh ooh... there's the signal. It's moving. So much for roy's shark. We're right over it. Oh, no. We're losing the signal. Shit. Hey, look at this. Looks like an overhang here. Could be a cave. Let's find out. Ok. Here we go. This has got to be expensive. Where'd you get all this stuff? I, uh, borrowed it from the aquarium. But... you don't work there anymore? No. Gotta take it back sometime. It's a cave, all right. There's another one. I've never seen so many great whites together before. Oh, there he is. Oh, shit. Come on. Jesus! Jesus! Guess you don't have to return it now. Hmm... i count 6 sharks. Great whites swimming in a school. That's never been recorded before. Nick: this is very strange. What'd you find in the autopsy? It's not our shark. We gotta find it. Nick, uh, the lab work came back. Take a look at this. There are 3 times as many white blood cells, and their metabolic rate is almost off the chart. No wonder it was so aggressive. Maybe they're sick. Like rabies or something. Well, if it was only one shark, i'd agree with you. But i found the same thing in the shark roy caught. What do you think it is? Well, i did some digging, and i came up with this. A scientist up north named dr. Craven was doing some weird experiments, pumping great whites full of steroids and god knows what, trying to find a cancer serum. But get this. The sharks were all female... and pregnant. And you think these sharks are the offspring. Altered on a cellular level, yes. According to this, these sharks would only be about a year old. But already they're the size of a grown adult. They're growing at an accelerated level. And hunting in packs. There's no telling how dangerous they're going to get. We're in bigger trouble than i thought. Mayor: you want me to shut down the beaches? Nick: yes. Everything, right now. What about the surfing competition? Cancel it. It starts in 2 hours. Michael: look, i've heard enough! I am not going to the sponsors to tell them to cancel because we've got mutant sharks. I mean, this is insane! Insane is ignoring this until someone else dies, michael. Gentlemen... let's try and be civil. Now, i can't discount what dr. Harris has here. But at the same time, i'm not about to start a full-blown panic. You can't deny those sharks are out there. What do you think about all this, roy? You want my opinion? Sounds like a lot of scientific mumbo-jumbo to me. We know it sounds crazy, but look at the evidence. Are you willing to risk more people's lives? You talk about risking lives? He tagged that shark, knew where it was, and he told no one. I thought i could handle it. You obviously couldn't. Gentlemen, let's stick to the subject at hand. Michael, are the beaches safe? There are antishark nets all along the beach we're using for the competition. And now we know where the sharks are. This is so boring. You want to make the beaches safe? You get me that locator and you never have to worry about those sharks again. Fine. We'll work together. I don't think so. There's only one captain on my boat. I think you've done enough for now, dr. Harris. Mr. Bishop seems best equipped to handle the situation. I want you to give him all your information. And, michael... keep me informed. Sure thing, mr. Mayor. Announcer: ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the cape classic surf competition sponsored by water world. We're so pleased to have you with us today. Some of the best surfing in the world right here in the cape waters. Some of the best competitors. Richard clemens now, completing his run. Anything yet? Hey, nick! Nick: hey, tom. Hey, mark. What's goin' on over here, stud? Nick, boy! Nick: good luck, guys. Hang loose. Samantha: see you guys! Man those cameras, guys. Everybody ready? You know, if there's a whole slew of whites down there, it may be too dangerous, even in cages. Maybe we shouldn't waste time-- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you guys getting a case of the pussies on me? Look, toughen up, guys. We're gonna kill the sharks, but not on this dive. Not until i get enough footage to make the discovery channel wet their little panties. You're the boss. You're damn right. Now, let's get in the water, and don't mess up on those close-ups. I need a lot of shots of me and the sharks for the intro. Yes, sir. You know the ritual. Heads. Never lets me down. Let's do it! Look out behind you! Look out! Get out! Get out of there! No! Hootie! Newman! Come on, pierson! Come on, buddy, swim for it! Come on, boy! Swim! Swim, buddy! Swim for it! Faster! Come on, swim! Newman! Get me out of here! Take my hand! Get me out! Help! Newman: no! Help! No! Fuck! Uhh! Come on, roy! For god's sake, swim faster! Newman! Come on! Get me outta here! They're comin' at you! Come on, swim! Newman! Grab my hand! Grab my hand! Get me out! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Roy, where are they heading? What? The beach. Announcer: it's a beautiful day here for the competition, sponsored by water world. The cape town surf competition continues. Hey, bro, let's catch some waves. Yeah. And do this. Oh, yeah. I'll show you how to do it, man. Watch this. Yeah! Go! Shark in the water! Shark in the water! Get out! Out! Get out! Out of the water now! Get out! Out of the water! Shark! Get out of the water! Shark! Get out! Get out! Get on the beach! Everyone, out of the water! Shark! Oh, my god. Sorry. I'll be right back. Where are you going?! Everybody, get out of the water! Ohh... tom! Look out, tom, i'm gonna ram him! Oh, god, nick. Come on! Mark! Uhh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Mark! Tom, look out! Aah! Aah! Aah! Tom! Come on, come on. Help! Tom! Give me your hand! Samantha: hurry up! Get him out of the water! Be careful. You're gonna be ok. You'll be ok. Lie him over here. How is he? Paramedic: he'll make it. Is he gonna be ok? I don't know. Mayor: this was a bloodbath! On my beach! Yes! I'll take care of it. You told me you could handle this. But roy here-- don't try to push this off on someone else. You thought the incident at the aquarium was a nightmare. We've got 5 dead, more injured! We're facing lawsuits! And i've got to issue some kind of statement. The press is looking for a scapegoat, michael, and guess who's first in line. What the fuck happened out there, mr. Wonderful? The sharks attacked us from every angle. They killed hootie and pierson. I was lucky to get out of there alive. I heard about your friends. I'm sorry. I take it you believe us now, sir. I wish i had earlier. Do you know how to handle this? We have a plan. All right. Do whatever you have to do. You have all my resources at your disposal. To those lost at sea. To those lost at sea. You know, sharks are evil. They need to be destroyed. Not evil, roy. There's only a handful of shark attacks every year compared to the millions we slaughter. What do you call something that indiscriminately attacks and kills people? It's a murderer. Right, and they deserve to die. I grew up off the coast of florida. Swimming before i could walk. I used to dive all the time. School, no school. Drove my mom nuts. And i remember one day-- i just turned 16-- i was diving on a coral reef. Had a big cave underneath it. I followed a yellowtail inside. And somehow i... lost my bearings. It was pitch black in there. Very, very quiet. And a chill ran up my back. 'Cause i could feel that there was something else in there... watching me. Next thing i knew, i was in the jaws of a 9-foot tiger shark. Jeez... the pressure was intense, like a... a vise. But it didn't really hurt that day. Guess i must have been in shock, because he bit right through to the bone. Punctured my stomach. Took 297 stitches to sew me back up. And i remember thinking... that at that precise moment, i could live or die. I was... at the mercy of a force of nature that recognized me as the enemy. A very humbling experience, mate. For whatever reason, he decided to let go. The killing machine let me live. What about these sharks? They definitely have a taste for human flesh. Now, because some so-called scientists have tampered with nature in the name of progress, these sharks are very screwed up. And that is why we have to put them down. As for the rest of the species, they've been here, in their domain, for almost 450 million years. And i think they've earned the right to stay. Having said that, are we all game to finish this? Abso-fuckin'-lutely. Here. This is the underwater cave where they've been hanging out. It's big enough to hold them all. Get 'em in there and wipe 'em out. Ah, it sounds complicated. I say we get some depth charges and hunt these things down one at a time. It's not that easy anymore. They have a group mentality. If we try to kill them individually, they'll preserve the pack, head to open sea. Got to deal with them now and all at once. That's great, except how do you plan to get them all into the cave? They're not gonna just swim in there. He's right. They're gonna have to want to go in there. They'll want to go. We tie a couple of these generators together, we should have a pulse strong enough to attract them all. So, what, you just put that inside the cave and the sharks come running? Hopefully. The tough part will be getting the device deep enough into the cave. I know. I have to get it in there somehow. What, you're going to put it in the cave? Are you crazy? I have to make sure they're all in there. Roy: wait. Wait. I've got an idea. One that will give us some better protection. Where are you going? To call a friend about making a special delivery. Finish the device, i'll see you at the docks tomorrow morning at 10:00. Finished? Yeah. What's the matter? Nothin'. You seem a little quiet. This is crazy. You've seen what those sharks can do. It's a bit risky, yeah. A bit? Nick, you could die. I have no intention of dying now. Besides, super roy seems to think it's a good idea. Roy would jump in the water with a snorkel and a hand grenade. Probably would, huh? You don't have to do this. It's not your responsibility. I know that. But somebody has to end this. But why you? If i walk away and somebody else dies, i don't know if i could live with myself. I've already lost my sister. I don't want to lose you, too. I don't want to be lost, sam. Ohh... ohh... hey. G'day. Come on up. I got a couple of great things to show you guys. Underwater demolition explosives. 20 pounds worth, complete with detonator and timer. Should be enough to turn those bastards into a bloody shark smoothie. I'm not even gonna ask where you got that. I think it's better that you don't. I have something else to show you. Here's that special delivery i was talking about. What is it? It's a mini-sub i bought from jacques cousteau's people just after he passed away. She'll do 10 knots. It might just keep those sharks from having us for breakfast. So you happy? Oh, yeah. Good. Now let's go blow up some shit, eh? We use the mini-sub to lead the sharks into the cave, drop off the pulse generator and the explosives, and we're out of there. Is that gonna work? It has one small wrinkle. Radio waves won't penetrate through all that rock. Meaning what? We can't remote detonate the bomb from up here. You tell us that now? We can't be in the water either. The concussion blast would kill us. I know, i know. That's why i got the timer. Now, we arm the bomb with the green button and start the countdown with the red one. I'm setting the timer for 10 minutes. So once we start the countdown... we can't stop it. Better get it right the first time. I'm going with you. I'd rather you didn't. Well, what can i do from here, then? We'll be fine down there. We can fire that thing underwater? Specially designed glock. Range is only about 20 feet, but she'll do the trick. I got this tradition that i do every time i dive. So if you'd help me with it... heads or tails? Sam? Heads. I, uh... i want you to keep this for me. It'll bring you good luck. I'll go check with newman. We're getting close. Well. Well. It's gonna be all right. Don't worry. How about a little optimism here? You got a nice coin out of it. Just be careful, nick, ok? All i need is this. And this. If i have those things... all i need is this. We'll be all right. Roy: clearing 20 feet. Anything exciting yet? Nick: nothing. Everything ready? Yes, ma'am. Nick: let's turn on the generator. Got a heartbeat. How do we look up top, sam? Samantha: i've got multiple signals. They're definitely nearby. You should see them by now. Nothing yet. Whoa! What's wrong? Well, we found 'em. Don't you mean they found us? I'm gonna turn up the juice. Now we've got their attention. And me without my camera. Don't get too close. No closer than we have to. Time to get serious. Right. It's armed. We've got the cave on the scope. Do you see it yet? We see it. Let's give these bloody dingoes what they deserve. Uhh! Get off! Get off! Shit! Uhh! This isn't working! I'm shutting off the generators. Shoot him! Shoot him, roy! Get your gun and shoot him! I can't. I have to try to control the sub. They've got us from the back. Shit! Shit! I'm losing it! We're going down! We're going down! Get the cage into the water. Why? What are you going to do? Just do it! Oh, god! Oh, god! Aw, shit. Nick, nick. I hit the button. The countdown's started. Oh, great. I'm gonna let the air out of the cage's buoyancy tanks. Cut the rope. Would you help me open this thing? I'm trying, but it's jammed. Samantha: uhh! My side's jammed, too. There's no way out of here. Nice driving, roy. Yeah, thanks, nick. Thanks a lot. Like it was my fault. I can't get it off. Help me with this. Sure, let's just get it open, then. Come on, let's push. Come on, nick! Together! Uhh! Uhh! Come on, we can do it! Come on, nick! Come on! Samantha: hi, guys. Nick: sam! Roy: hey, what are you doing here? Saving your bacon. Roy: that's it. Come on. Get us out. Come on, everybody push together. Nick: 1, 2. Roy: great! Thanks, sam. I gotta check the damage. Ok, guys. Stay close to the sub. Watch your backs, guys. Nick, get to the back of the sub. Let's try and right this thing. Be careful, you guys. Roy: how's it look? Nick: not good. We don't have much time, roy. Let's move it. Right. Come on, nick! Uhh! 1, 2. Guhh! Samantha: way to go, guys. Look at 'em. I'm gonna spill some guts right here. Don't get 'em pissed off. We still gotta get out of here. All right. Let's get the sub into the cave. Let's just floor the engine, aim it at the entrance, and let it go. The rudder's all messed up. It won't steer straight on its own. Then i'll pilot it. Roy, that's suicide. I'll bail out in time. Trust me. Bishop, please. There's got to be another way. It's going to be ok. I know what i'm doing. Please, roy, think about this. There's no time now. Get yourselves topside. I'll see you guys later. Let me have the spear gun. Here you go. I hope he knows what he's doing. All righty. Now let's see how tough you really are. Follow me, you bastards. Yeah. What's that? Time to get out of here. He did it! Bishop! Uhh! Ohh! Oh, shit! Roy! No! Aah! Aah! Nick! Aah-aah! Oh, nick! Aah! Help! I'm goin' in! Uh, it's too late, nick. Roy: ohh! Aah! Aah! Oh, my god. We gotta get out of here. Come on. Ok. Look out! Aah! Oh, my god. Nick! Oh. Oh, my god. Come on, you bastard. Keep away from him. Come on, turn over here. Over here. Oh, my god, sam. That's it. That's it. Come on. Come on! Come on! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Ohh! Bite this, motherfucker! Oh, my god, nick, i thought you were dead. Close. Come on. We're out of time. Nick: come on. Come on! Ohh! Get down. Ok. You're ok? Yeah, we're ok. What happened to roy? He didn't make it. Oh, my god, skipper. He died saving us. Roy: hello. Roy? Roy? Skipper! Somebody want to get a picture? [Coughing, chuckling] just rest. You're going to be ok. Thanks. No, no, no, no. What happened down there? You mean how come i'm alive? Well, this shark dragged me into the cave, was getting ready to have me for dinner... so i pulled out my dive knife, and i made him reconsider! Then i found a small tunnel at the back of the cave. I dumped all my gear, and i squeezed my way out. You're crazy, you know that? Maybe, but after this, i'm gonna be huge! Imagine the ratings. I'll be bigger than cousteau ever was. I'm not gonna forget you two. I'll even put you on my show. Escapin' the jaws of death. Oh, roy bishop. Roy bishop escapin' the jaws of death. Good night. Roy bishop and the jaws of death. I have a problem. What is it? What am i gonna do with a beautiful, intelligent, sensitive woman who's willing to risk her life for me? I sure hope you know the answer to that question, nick. Let's go home.
