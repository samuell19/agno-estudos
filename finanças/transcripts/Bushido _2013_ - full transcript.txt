In 1600, a war between Tokugawa and Toyotomi split Japan into two. The feudal domains which were later called "han" (similar to a clan) were forced to take sides. Tokugawa won, establishing the Tokugawa Shogunate which ruled Japan for over 260 years. The hans which sided with Toyotomi were called "tozama han". The hans were commanded to use their money solely for the shogunate, thus they could not even repair their castle without permission. The shogunate annihilated hans for the slightest violation; particularly the tozama hans. This story takes place in 1735, within the Inaba-han, a tozama han. We're finally recovering from the famine three years ago, yet the shogunate is so demanding. And now this... So many headaches. That's... Our men's midwinter training. Let's have a look. All halt! Kusaka. Kimura. A bout. Yes, sir. Come. Kimura, get back up. Mr. Kusaka, I'll take you! Halt! Behave, the lord deputy is here. Harada, your thoughts? Yes, sir. Unacceptable, sir, since it's only an exercise. But... In a real battle, it may prove effective. Defeat the opponent by all means to survive, and take on others to protect the lord. That shows devotion also. Now in these times of peace, strength is not everything. Harada, bushido cannot be mastered through wild swordplay. Yes... Yes, sir. It's almost time, sir. Funase, who was that? That was... Hiroki Kagawa, son of Hironoshin Kagawa. I see... That Kagawa... BUSHIDO Today, Funase has a report to make, so I allowed him to attend. Funase. Yes, sir. I am here to report on Master Matsumiya. He's making inquiries into ourhan's internal affairs. But he's a master of swordsmanship. He's involved in... Shogun Yoshimune's flood control project in Edo. Of course, as I suspected. Ever since becoming the shogun, Shogun Yoshimune has been promoting swordsmanship, but why send us a Shinkage-style swordplay master? I knew there was something behind it. So how much does Matsumiya know about our affairs? Sir, I'm not certain. What are you doing? It's an urgent matter. Go find out, now. Yes, sir. Lord Deputy, must we contribute to the shogunate's flood project? If we do, all our efforts will go to waste. We'll lose all the money we've been amassing. All of it. Then what will we do? If Matsumiya were to find out about our surplus fund... We've no choice but to offer the surplus fund. Our han will be annihilated if we resist at all. I believe Shogun Yoshimune hasn't annihilated any since he assumed his position, but the fifth Tokugawa Shogun Tsunayoshi annihilated 27 hans. I hear Shogun Yoshimune is as austere. Indeed... About a decade ago, we were on the line. I feared that would be the end for us then and there. Our late lords were the bloodline of Lord Tadakatsu, the grandson of the first Tokugawa shogun. Although a tozama-han, we had deep ties to the shogunate. So the shogunate forgave us when Hironoshin Kagawa took all the blame. Our current Lord Yoshiyasu, however, is adopted. It won't go like last time. So we must be ever mindful of our actions this time. Does it hurt? Yeah. You're too headstrong. Watch who you're up against. Only you can protect yourself. The battle days are over, but we must be prepared at all times. Be able to use our swords like our hands. Forget form. When you're up against a crowd, will they come at you like in training? It comes down to how swiftly you can attack. So can you go train with the neighboring han? I've already asked Master Harada, but... But what will Master Matsumiya say? He's too overbearing. He won't approve. Stop by my place. Get your bruises treated. My sister will take care of you. Does it hurt a lot? No. Not at all, it's only a scratch. Really? Kimura, you seemed to be in pain earlier. Perhaps she has great healing powers. Kagawa! Take it easy, the pain should settle overnight. So rest well. Yuki, thank you. Only if I were stronger... You're strong here. Sword skills aren't the only way. You have your studies. It's enough to have one thing you excel at. I don't want to excel at anything. I want to help others. My father is developing a drought-resistant rice breed. I want to follow in his footsteps. Sorry, I forgot about your father. I shouldn't have said that. No, it's fine. It may mean nothing to you, but I heard what your father did. What he did was noble. He took all the blame to save our/wan. What's so great? He had us, but took all the blame and committed harakiri. Hiroki, say no more. Kagawa... All I can say is, your dream to go train shall be granted. I'll start a family with Yuki and pursue my studies. That should give your parents peace of mind. Training permission for the son of Hironoshin Kagawa? Yes, sir. I could, on behalf of our lord in Edo, but would the Houki-han accept? The better approach is... They wouldn't decline if he has Master Matsumiya's recommendation. He is the swordplay master appointed by the shogunate, after all. Yes, sir. So get a recommendation from Master Matsumiya first. We'll talk then. By the way, I haven't seen my grandson lately. How's lchinosuke? He's become quite a riot, sir. I see, that's my boy. Bring him sometime. Tell my daughter that, too. According to the one shadowing Master Matsumiya, the unregistered fields and warehouses are still safe. But he's searching everywhere every day, so it's only a matter of time. We must take action immediately. Funase, any good ideas? It's best that he leave our han before he finds out, but we need a good scheme... The other councilors? Not a single idea? No, sir. They're just shaken up. I see. Just like last time... Yes, sir. Not many know about Hironoshin Kagawa's devotion. He secretly created unregistered fields and warehouses, and saved the lnaba-han, no... He saved the many lives of our people. But... It was deemed treacherous by the shogunate, which decided to annihilate our han, but Kagawa claimed it was his doing alone, taking all the blame, and committed harakiri. By doing so... Kagawa... saved our han. I beg you. Please write a recommendation for Kagawa. Kagawa of all people... Although it was for Kimura, Kagawa used his leg and thrust a sword at Kusaka's throat. He's too immature. I will speak... I represent the shogunate, so my permission will be official. I cannot allow that. It's Kagawa's lifelong dream. Please reconsider, sir. Harada approached Master Matsumiya? For Master Matsumiya's recommendation, I presume... Lord Deputy, what recommendation? Kagawa's son is desperate to go train with the Houki-han, so Harada must have asked Master Matsumiya for a recommendation. Funase, what's on your mind? Nothing, sir. Yamazaki, you a father now? I can't wait to go home. That adorable? Let me stop by. Come anytime. So Fujita, what's your plan? I'm no good with swords. I'm better at accounting. Swordfighting isn't my thing. I hate fighting with others. Mr. Kimura, when will you wed Yuki? We haven't decided, but in the spring. She's older than you, right? Lucky you. Once you're wed, you will become Mr. Kagawa's older brother? Mr. Kimura, the older brother? Which means, you must listen to him from now. Hey- Give this to the usual man. Yes, sir. Give me what you just got. Keep quiet if you want to live. Understood? Yes. He found out this much? Yes, sir. He found out everything. I'm terribly sorry, sir. Ito. Stay on Matsumiya. You cannot fail this time. Yes, sir. Right away. Everything... Hiroki, here. I put in a talisman from Kumashiro Shrine. So you were making this? Yes. You'll be leaving for your training soon, so one for you and one for Mr. Kimura. I see. I've caused you trouble since our parents passed. I want you to become happy with Kimura. He's a nice man. But... a little too nice, though. That worries me. I'm worried about you, Hiroki. I'll just do what I want. That's what worries me. You're too headstrong. Too headstrong... Sister, fatherjust followed the Iran's order, which was deemed treason, so took all the blame and his life. Father was merely used by the ban. It wasn't his fault. Hiroki, what our father did was very noble. I was small. I couldn't do anything. And now, all I can do is to become strong. Kagawa, you home? You need something? Uh, well... One for Hiroki... And this... Foryou. For me, too? Yes. Thank you. Kagawa... The lord deputy approved, but you need Master Matsumiya's permission. So did you speak with Master Matsumiya? I did. What did Master Matsumiya say? He was reluctant... Let me speak with him again. So be patient. Yes, sir. Ito has an urgent message, sir. Let him in. Ito. My report, sir. The shogun's envoy has left Edo and is fast approaching. He should be arriving soon. Understood. Leave now. Lord Deputy, we're out of time. If the envoy meets Master Matsumiya... You sure, Kimura? Yes, it's quite a sword, but take it. I'll pursue my studies. This'll be enough. I'd rather have you use it for your training. I really appreciate it. Besides, I got this. I see... That'll protect you well. I keep mine here. I want to test out the Houki-han': Musashi Enmei-style. Kagawa! Apologize to Mr. Kusaka about the match. What? Kagawa, patience. What's that on your belt? That's none of your business. A good luck charm? You can't beat me without it? What? No, Kagawa! Fights are prohibited. Draw your sword. Kagawa, don't. You'll lose your chance for training. Kimura, what training? We haven't heard about this. Damn. How dare you! Three against one on Kimura! Why you! Kagawa! What is going on? Kagawa. Master Harada begged me on his knees for your training. I was starting to reconsider, but no more. If I permit your training, you'll be my, no, the shogun's disgrace. Master Harada begged for me... I beg you, sir, please give me your permission. Move. I beg you, sir. I beg you, sir. How impudent. Kagawa, stop. Kusaka, we'll go drink soon. My pleasure, sir. What brings the shogun's envoy here? I presume it's about the flood control project in Edo. If he meets Master Matsumiya... Kagawa caused havoc in front of Master Matsumiya... My, my, he's so hot-blooded. Even as the envoy is fast approaching... Lord Deputy, what will you do? Listen, you just sit there and do nothing but expect me to do all the work. Say no more. I fought with Kusaka yesterday. Master Matsumiya reprimanded me and I can no longer go train. I also lost the good luck charm you gave me. I'm sorry. Seriously... Hiroki... Kagawa! Thank you, sir. Master Harada, you begged for me... Forget about that. I heard about you and Master Matsumiya. Be patient if you want to go train. Yes, sir. There's nothing misleading about swordsmanship. It's pure. Strength is everything. That's why you want to master it. You're my... pupil of over ten years. You were only a restless boy then, but... Be patient. Endurance is true strength. You remind me of a raging flame, so hot and furious. Kagawa, be like water. A sword like crystal clear water at all times. Your heart as crystal clear as water. Always keep that in mind. Yes, sir. It's for the han... Matsumiya is... a master of the Shinkage-style. Harada... Make absolutely sure that no suspicion falls on the han. Understood? Ma'am, thank you for coming out today. Don't mention it. We'll soon be family. No need for formalities. Thank you. After my father's incident 12 years ago, my mother fell ill, so you took such great care of both my brother and I. I cannot thank you enough. After my mother passed, you and your family looked after us so kindly. I don't know what would've become of us if you hadn't been there for us. That's not true. You've been trying so hard. Your family and son are too good for me. Don't say that. My intended left me after my father's incident. I am grateful that I might marry your son. I am really... really happy to marry him. I'm wishing you all the happiness you well deserve. I trust that you can support my son. By the way! I want our relatives from Houki to attend your wedding. But the border is deep in snow now and hard to cross, so when the cherry blossoms bloom. Yes. Kagawa! Is Kagawa home? Yes, sir. At work tomorrow, go see Mr. Funase. Yes, understood, sir. "Lord of the Houki-han" You must be surprised for the sudden development. Your request for training has been approved. Take this to the Houki-han. The details are in there. Thank you, sir. "Travel Permit" This is the travel permit. Go get ready and leave immediately. Lodge outsid the castle town tonight. Tomorrow... Stop by Fukuon Temple first. Visit your parents' grave at the temple. You should arrive in Houki by the evening. The following day, visit the Houki-han with this letter. Yes, sir. The lord deputy... thinks he should inform all our men about your father's devotion. What a great honor. Thank you, sir. Your father's deed 12 years ago was... ...noble. Thank you, sir. Master Harada. I'm so grateful to you. Thank you, sir. About what? My training in Houki. I just heard from Mr. Funase. I thought you put in a good word. I hear the Musashi Enmei-style is popular there. Train well and come back. Yes, sir. When are you leaving? Right away, once I pack. I see. That's quite sudden. Houki is not so far, so you can return anytime. My sister will marry in the spring. I plan to return then. I see. Take care. Yes, sir. And you, sir. Mr. Kimura... He's innocent... Besides... The envoy is arriving tomorrow. So it must be tonight. Only he has a grudge against Master Matsumiya. No one will question it. Good for you. Thanks. My dream has finally come true. Kimura, take good care of my sister. Send my regards to your mother, too. Sure, of course. My mother knows you two since you were small. Leave it to me. I'll be back for your wedding. And... I'll take the sword you gave me. Sister. I'll see you off. Hiroki, take care. Watch your temper, be patient. Don't worry. Be happy with Kimura. I'll be back for your wedding. Take care of yourself. Ichinosuke. Gramps. Gramps. Gramps. Gramps. Oh sorry, boy. You're so energetic, lchinosuke. Go get it. Ready? There. Thank you for dinner. Thank you, sir. Master Matsumiya, thank you very much. I learned a lot about the Shinkage-style and bushido. Kusaka, I take you as a man of spirit. You can't be losing against a power player like Kagawa. Don't you want to become a swordmaster? Skill is merely a tool. It's your spirit. Win with your spirit. I will train harder. That goes for all of you. Yes, thank you, sir. Sir, we'll walk you home. No need. I'll be fine alone. No, we insist, sir. You must be tired listening to me lecture. Go drink more. Thank you, sir. Sir, please take this. Good night, sir. You... Come! Master Matsumiya! Saeki, go inform others! Hey! This is Kagawa's. Lord Deputy. Come in. It's done, sir. I see. Yes, sir. Master Matsumiya's murderer is... Kagawa. It's to be Kagawa. I did not tell you so you could focus... on the task. But Kagawa is... I know. But who else? A master of the Shinkage-style cannot be beaten by a scoundrel. Which means... If we are to claim it as a personal grudge... It has to be Kagawa. - But... - That's an order. It's to save our/ran. It's our only way. Then I will. No. Absolutely not. Think of your position in the han. If you take the blame, the shogunate will suspect the entire ban. Think about our/ran. I understand how you feel. But you must endure. For our han. No... For our people. Harada. Get a team ready. Find Kagawa at Fukuon Temple. Take him out. What happened? Don't worry. I'll be back soon. The baby is crying. Mother, I'm going. Why at this hour? Quiet! Master Matsumiya... has been murdered. The perpetrator is... Hiroki Kagawa. He had been asking for permission to train in Houki, but was denied, so he went on a rampage and fled. So now... Take Kagawa out! Yes, sir! Please wait. Kagawa would never do such a thing. SaekL This was found at the scene. It can't be... It's Kagawa's for sure. It must be a mistake. He got the permission. I was... Kimura, let it be. Stay here if you want. Step down now. This is urgent. The shogun's envoy will be arriving this evening. Get Kagawa before then. Yes, sir. Prepare immediately. We will leave at dawn. The snow may get heavier. Come prepared! What will you do? I'll go. I need to know. Hironoshin Kagawa... Hiroki Kagawa... Lord Deputy. The shogun's envoy is arriving shortly. Assemble! We'll divide into two. Kusaka, the map. We're here, this forked road. I'll go to Fukuon Temple. You all bypass Mt. Kumashiro to the border. I'll take one messenger. If I find and slay Kagawa at the temple, I'll send the messenger. Yuuki. You'll be my messenger. Follow me. Master Harada, did Kagawa really slay Master Matsumiya? What? This is the ban'; order. It is our duty to follow it. Kusaka, if you find Kagawa, keep him there. Don't touch him until I get there. I will slay Kagawa. Kimura, don't come. Then please allow me to go with you, Master Harada. Keep your guard up! Yes, sir. Let's Mr. Kusaka, a short break. Okay, a quick break. Yes, sir. I'm amazed Kagawa could slay Master Matsumiya. Master Matsumiya was drunk. I want Kagawa dead. You... I don't like fighting. I'm going home. What are you saying? Calm down, Fujita. Okay, let's leave! Yes, sir. Fukuon Temple. Yuuki, search the premises. Kimura, you stay here. Did you hear about Hiroki? No. It's not confirmed, but I heard... Master Matsumiya was murdered last night, and Hiroki is suspected of it. Hiroki is...? But he would never do such a thing. But my son and the others have been assembled to capture him. That's... I'm hoping it's a mistake, but... It must be. A bad mistake! I'm worried about my son, too... K-Kagawam! Kimura. Why are you here? Kagawa, surrender! Kimura, what's this? You murdered Master Matsumiya! What? No excuses! Kimura, what's going on? You didn't? Murder Master Matsumiya last night? What? Of course not! Kimura, shut up! Master Harada, I found Kagawa! Kagawa's here! Kagawa, run! Run to the border! Move, Kimura! Run! I said, move! Stop! Get off! Run, Kagawa, run! Get off! Run! Kimura... Yuki... Have her... Kimura... Why is this happening? Kimura! Yuuki! Regarding Matsumiya's case. The perpetrator killed him because he could not get the permission to go train, then he fled. Is that correct? Yes, sir. We dispatched a team after him, so he should be taken down shortly. You're saying... The perpetrator will be slain today? Yes, sir. Despite a personal grudge, he killed our respected guest sent by the shogun. The lnaba-han is taking the matter seriously, sir. I promise we will take his life by all means. Matsumiya was... the most suitable swordplay master for your/ran. I handpicked him myself. However... the perpetrator is one of your men. The shogun will conduct a thorough investigation. Well, that's that. There is the flood control project in Edo, too. After the perpetrator has been killed, we will talk about it in detail. Father... Mother... Please protect Hiroki. Kimura, sorry. I was framed! Damn... Damn it! Run, faster! "4 km to the border" Faster! I must find... another swordplay master for your/wan. I must select... an even more skilled swordmaster. I also hear... you appoint your lord deputy based on kinship. But I doubt that it is good practice... So many things I must work on as soon as I return to Edo. First, Matsumiya's murder. Or perhaps... It may have been premeditated... "To sister" "Hiroki" Hiroki... Mr. Kimura... "2 km to the border" There's Kagawa! Kagawa! Wait! Don't move! Kagawa! The spears! Give me! Kagawa, I'll slay you for murdering Master Matsumiya! I didn't. Mr. Kusaka, please stop! Master Harada ordered us to keep Kagawa here, not to slay him! That's why I will! If you all can't, I will! Draw your sword! I didn't slay Master Matsumiya! You can't fool us! Your swords! Draw them, now! Draw your swords! You, too, Kagawa! Wait, please wait. Don't do this! Move! Take out Kagawa who jeopardized ourhan! Why you...! Don't do this, let's all go home! Get off! Let me go! Saeki... Gouda... Shirai! Fujita! Mother... Fujita! Fujita... Kagawa. How dare you! Why did it come to this? Why do you have to kill me? Why did all of us have to fight each other? Master Harada, answer me! Is this bushido?! What a beautiful moon. However... Once it's full, it must wane. Lord Deputy. That's... Harada... Sh... Master Harada has reported, he has slain Kagawa. As proof, he brought back Kagawa's topknot. Is that... really the perpetrator's? What about... the rest of the team? Kagawa... took them all out. Well, that is... Although a criminal... I'm impressed. No wonder he could slay Matsumiya. Well, you've shown great loyalty to the authorities at the expense of so many lives. How impressive. I will surely... inform the shogun. Lord Deputy... You've done enough. Funase. Get Harada treated. Lord Deputy Araki. You are... secure for another while. At least tonight. What's that look? Is that how you behave toward the shogunate? Harada is the lord deputy's son-in-law. He must be upset... This way, please. Please, sir. Forgive me... BUSHIDO A Yasuo Mikami Office Co., Ltd. Production Written, Directed & Edited by YASUO MIKAMI Subtitles by CHIEKO NAKAI
