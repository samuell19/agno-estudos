If you don't believe me, come with me to my house after this. There's no such thing. You're delusional. It may just be your feeling. You are easily getting scared since I first know you. Lisa, listen. Even at my house. Lately I often experience this kind of strange scary thing. It's true, La, it's true. No such thing exists here. This is a campus, not a graveyard. What are you talking about? You're delusional. Well, fine. Okay. But I'll ask for my mom's permission first. Okay? Come on. No need to get paranoid, nothing there. There's nothing here. Come on. Come on, Lisa, don't be such paranoid. Hello. You're so cute. Come here. Tini. Over here. What are you doing there? You're coming here with who? And what are you riding to get here?

I told you I was going to my room. Then who's the one making me some drink? Lala. You believe me now, don't you? I think what you told me is true. But just calm down. There's something wrong about your house. Let me observe first. Lala? Lisa. Lisa. Is that true? And I feel that the negative aura in this house is very strong. I was going around your house. I'm sure now. Then what should I do? Move to another house again? If you and your family are not comfortable indeed, just move. But ... but no rush. ... on finding out why this house is haunted. Because I'm still curious ... Is it true that you can see those kind of things? Don't take it seriously. Yes, yes, I'm just kidding. It's true. I ... I never meant to take advantage of you at all.

So ... ... in your opinion ... ... after what had happened ... ... after you'd seen my twins ... ... what do you think? ... to be honest ... Well ... ... I really don't like my ability to see those kind of things. To be able to see those kind of things. ... it's so disgusting. I think ...

Thank you. Now ... ... just go get me some drink. Go now. Go get it yourself. You know where the kitchen is. What a friendly host. So? Look, 'mbah' (old master). On my first day of work ... ... I saw an apparition of a little girl. ... there was another ghost in that house. But I also felt that ... Please help me, mbah. I'm so scared, mbah. One moment. From what I've seen ... ... I saw an embittered spirit. Which follows your employer. Those spirits are disturbing all the people living in that house. Including you. Now what, mbah? I also see ... ... a doll. Which owns negative force. Yes, yes, yes. You're right, there's a doll. You're right. There's a doll. Vivi holds that doll. Bring this with you. Put these flowers at every corner of the house.

Come on, I don't wanna be late. One second, sis. What're you doing? Hey! Tini, what's wrong with you? You can't go in? Vi! Okay, one second. What're you doing? She can't go inside the house. Poor Tini. Tini is my new friend. Who is Tini? I don't see her. Is she your imaginary friend? Don't mess around! Bye. We'll play again later. Come on, let's go. Miss Sumi. What smell is this? ... some kind of flowers? It's a smell of ... But this smell is so sharp. Sometimes this season is filled with this flowery fragrant smell. This area is attached with this smell. When you're getting used to it, you won't smell it anymore. Walaikumsalam. Salamualaikum. Take good care of the house. I'm leaving now. My friend has come to pick me up. Okay. Hurry up. So sorry I'm late. Gosh. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, I'm late. It doesn't sound good yet. Let's try to play that yesterday's music again. Are you ready? Okay. Ready? What's wrong? What is it? No, no, no. What's wrong with you? Vin! I'm also puzzled here. ... your house is fine, there's nothing wrong with it. Because the way I saw it ... I wonder what makes your house uncomfortable. Are you all right, Lisa? Where is it? Dammit, La. And that is the same ghost which always appears at my house, La. The ghost showed up again. I believe you, Lisa. Because I can also feel that the negative aura around here is so strong. According to you, why am I always being followed? That's what makes me curious. ... must be terrorized by those ghosts. Every person who lives in that house, including me, your close friend ... ... you're not the only one being terrorized by those ghosts. But I'm sure ... Let's go home now. Damn. Come on, let's go home. Vi? Vi? Tini, come inside, quick! Whom are you talking to? And whose flowers you mess up at the front? I don't know who put those flowers at the front. Enough! Tini said because of that, she can't go inside. I don't want to hear you talk about your imaginary friend anymore! I said enough! Tini is real, sis. Miss Sumi! Miss Sumi! Miss Sumi! Mama! Mama! Ma! Miss Sumi! Miss Sumi! Ma! Ma! Miss Sumi! Miss Sumi! Ma! Mama! Hello? What? Okay, I'm going to the hospital now. Please wait outside. The doctor will check out your mother's condition. Excuse me. Okay. What's wrong? I'm okay. It's okay. How is your mama? I have no idea. I've been waiting for the news from Vino. Vino is still inside. What happened to your mama? I don't exactly know what happened to her. But looks like she had a heart attack. Hopefully she's just too tired. Just calm down now. How is mama? I've been waiting for the result of the check-up. You better go home. Don't let Vivi be alone for too long at home. If there's any latest news from the doctor, I'll let you know. Promise to let me know right away, okay? Promise me. Be careful.

Miss, be careful during living in this house. Walaikumsalam. Salamualaikum. Now what? I'm actually so frightened to live in this house. And now my mama has become the victim. Who will be the next victim tomorrow? Just calm yourself down. Lisa, don't think about such thing. Let's go in, shall we? Brother, how is mama? Doctor said mama is fine. She just needs some rest. All right then. Okay. You better take some rest now. Go with me to the hospital tomorrow. Okay. Come on. Okay? You go to sleep first. Lisa. You heard what Vino said just now, right?

Uh-huh, I'm all right. Vivi. You've startled me. Where have you been? I was in the kitchen. Have you been running around near my room? Huh? No. No? It's true. I'm going to bed now. I'm sleepy, sis.

Brother? Have you found Vivi already? We've been looking everywhere but we haven't found her. Not yet. Where the heck is she? It's Vivi's doll. Yes. I found it over there. Hey, what's wrong with you, La? The doll ... I feel something strange about this doll. The negative aura is so strong. And I saw a big tree. A big tree? I also feel that ... ... I'm familiar with that big tree. One moment. Yes! It's a famous urban legend in Bandung. That dolls tree ... Wait, wait. I think ... ... I've experienced ... ... and so frightening near a big tree. ... I've been to experience a strange occurence ... ... but there was nobody in fact! ... she said she saw people crossing the street ... Vivi suddenly screamed at the time ... The car almost crashed because of that occurence. But I don't know whether that big tree is the one you mean or not. But if your vision was right ... ... then this doll must come from there. Because Vivi never has this doll before. All becomes clearer now. Let's look for Vivi over there now. Okay. Let's go. Come on. Look. It's true after all. Always asked her doll back. Because her own doll was broken. ... that little girl always asked for a doll. Because according to a psychic ... ... everytime you pass this street, you must put a doll at the tree. In order not to get disturbed ... Strange things happened frequently. Well ... there were many strange occurences. But I've never seen an apparition here. ... then got crashed against this tree. And she was hit ... She was crossing the street at the time. The daughter was carrying a doll. The victims were a mother and her 7 year old daughter. There was a hit and run here. ... in 1981 ... Watch this. / There was an occurence, if I'm not mistaken ... Dolls tree? The story of that dolls tree's ghosts you told us. How come those dolls tree's ghosts got here? But I'm puzzled here. I know. This must have anything to do ... ... with the moment when Vivi screamed in front of that tree. Look out! And I'm really sure ... ... the doll which belongs to Vivi ... ... must be given by that dolls tree's ghost. So they won't disturb us anymore. ... find out some information on how we can exorcise those ghosts now. ... find out more ... Brother ... I'm doing it now. It must be dumped or burned. In order not to get disturbed, some said the doll must be burned. ... it must be burned. From what I've heard ... Burn the dolls Burn. Okay then. We have to burn them. Come on. Let's go there now. ... when we get to the corner of the street, turn right. Brother ... Okay. You sure this is the right way? It seems so far. I know all the streets in Bandung. Relax. Yes, La, you better be sure so we won't get lost. I'm guessing that we'll be there around six o'clock. No speeding. I don't want anything bad happen to us. Brother, no, no, no. Okay, so I must speed up so we won't get there late at night. Vi! This is the tree. This is the tree I refer to. Our car almost got crashed here at the time, right, brother? You remember?
