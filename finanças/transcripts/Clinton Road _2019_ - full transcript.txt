- Oh God! Oh God, help me! Oh God! Oh God, help me! - Michael. Oh my gosh, we did it. - We did it. - This is the dream. - Yes. - It is! - Everything's beautiful here. Look at this. It's literally like fake. You look beautiful. Isn't that crazy? - Oh my gosh, it's so beautiful. Michael. - Hi, this is Michael, leave a message. - Hey Michael, it's Isabella. I just wanted to say hi. I know it's been almost a year now since everything that happened with Jess and I just want to see how you're doing. I heard you're dating someone new and I think that's great. I'd love to meet her. I'd also like to talk to you because I think that I have a way that maybe you and I can finally find some closure. So, let's try to meet up in the city, maybe this Saturday? Let me know what you think. Talk to you soon. - Good evening, Mr. Swartz. This is my stunning wife. - Yep, see you right here, RJ's VIPs. Thank you, have a good evening. - Michael, what's up, baby? Long time. - The renovations look fantastic. - Yeah, it took us awhile but we got it done. Carl. - Michael, nice to meet you. Shit, RJ. RJ, this is Kayla, Kayla this is RJ, an old time friend. - Pleasure to met you. - This is so dope. - Dope, dope, dope, that's exactly what we're looking for. You know what I'm saying? We have the dopest booth in the whole club waiting on you guys right in the back. - Yeah, let me show you the way. - Oh yeah. That's the temporary part. Renovations went a little bit over budget. He's very temporary. You better go check your girl. - Good to see you. - Yeah, yeah, don't lose sight of that dude. - Good evening. - Guests on RJ's list. Mike, Vinny and Tony. - Check the VIP for us, please? - RJ, do you know somebody named Ty? - If he's not on the list he can't get in. - Hey, paisano. - Carl. - Hey. - My man. - What's up, Ty? - Place looks-- - Don't say dope. - What? - Just don't say dope, what's the occasion? - I don't know, Michael said he wanted to go out. Said he had something important to run by me. - He's got a booth in the back. - Who's he with? - His new chick, Isabella, some hippy-looking girl and some weird-looking dude. - Isabella? What's she doing here? - How the fuck should I know? - Well. - Ty's here. Hi, honey. - Glad you could make it. - For sure, bro. Good to see you. - You too. - Gia, hey babe. - Hi, Tyler. - Is. I like the bullseye right between your tits. - Fuck you, Tyler. - Begory. - What? - Begory. - Yeah, we all heard you, bro. - My name is Begory. You greeted everybody else, so I figured I'd introduce myself. - Right. Sorry, how rude of me. Tyler. Nice to meet you. - Well, I think I'm ready for another drink. Would anyone else like to join me up at that bar? - Fuck yeah. Let's get this party started. - Okay, I was not talking to you. - Oh no, man, I'm good. - Fuck that. We haven't been out together in forever. - Should we even be in here? RJ's an ex-cop. - I come back here all the time. Don't worry about it. - I shouldn't. I don't wanna get too fucked up in front of Kayla. - Don't be a bitch. You've known her for like three months. - Yep. And things are going well. I don't wanna fuck it up. - What about Is? - What about Is? - Your girlfriend doesn't mind, you know, that you're hanging out with-- - My missing wife's sister? - Okay, yeah, that. - Kayla's cool. She understands. That's why we're all here tonight. You of all people know that I had a hard time with Jessica's disappearance but I'm better now. - Yeah. - Isabella hasn't had such an easy time trying to close that door. That's where Gianna and Begory come in. - Who? - Begory. - The guy with two different eyes and the scar? What the fuck is that guy's deal? - Why are you giving him such a hard time? Listen, Isabella thinks this will help her find closure and, quite frankly, it won't hurt me either. - So what's that got to do with "Big Gary" and Gia? - Begory. - Whatever. - What the fuck?! Busted, motherfuckers! - RJ, I'm sorry, man. - Are you fucking kidding me?! Girls sitting there smell weed coming from back here and it's you motherfuckers, are you serious, man? - Sorry. - This a good idea to you? Fucking disrespectful! You think that's okay? - No, RJ, my bad. - You said you come in here all the time. - I love scaring white boys. It's cool with me. Don't let Carl bust you, okay? He's got a lot of money invested in this club. They won't think it's funny, okay? - Yeah. - So just a fireman husband, that's it? - Well, that and I also want a princess wedding. - Of course you do. Have you talked to Michael about any of this? - I've always known that I'd be with a fireman. They're just so hot and manly. - And what about a career? Do you have any thoughts about something like that for yourself? - Well, I do some work for Victoria Secret and Michael's about to go back to, you know, being a fireman. - So, you're a model. - Most people do think I'm a model but, for now, I just work part-time at the mall. - I'm sorry. So you work at a Victoria Secret. You just said "you do some work" for Victoria Secret. So I thought. - Well, I could do the whole modeling thing but I don't wanna take any time away from my family. - Family is important, I will give you that. Do you come from a big family? - What? No. My parents said that one of me is enough. I mean, why try and top this, right? - Right. I mean, you did just say you didn't wanna take time away from family, so I thought maybe you had. - Oh, for when Michael and I get married and have kids. Two girls and two boys. Michael Junior, of course. The white picket fence. - I'm gonna be out by the table. - Compliments of the house. - The house special, Sledgehammers and Roar. - I love Roar. - Why does everybody look so serious? - You guys know that Jess went missing on Clinton Road, right? - Wait a minute, you guys come here to have a good time and that's the topic of discussion? - Well, this guy is clairvoyant and he's gonna take Mike and Is out there to talk to Jess, find out what happened. - Fuck that, man! That place is dark, man. Everybody knows that place is haunted. - Isn't it just a bunch of urban legends? - Says who, you? My aunt had a house near there, I know a lot about that place. - Wait, you've been there? - Been there? Had a fucking experience on that road. Listen, one night I'm driving, I'm by myself, it's dark. Driving down the road about two miles and I see this lady standing in the road. She's got her thumb out. So, me, I'm a nice guy, I decide I'm gonna pick her up. She gets in the car, she doesn't say one single word. So we drive about three miles and she says she wants to get out. So I stop the car, I let her out. She walks right off into the woods. Now that's not my problem, I'm not gonna go after her or anything but let me tell you, when she got out of that car, the hair was standing up on the back of my neck. - Big deal, a hitchhiker. - No, no, no, it doesn't stop there. I drive about two more miles and I see the same lady standing on the road with her thumb out. And it gets worse from there. I'm nervous so I punch out. And the next thing you know, I'm back on the same road where I first started. Like some time-shift shit. Like, I'm back, like I'm going in fucking circles and shit. Fuck that place, man, that shit is dark, that place is evil. Do not go there. - Evil? Come on, RJ, you don't actually believe in that shit. - Listen, man, haven't you ever felt somebody was watching you? Like they was standing over you. I mean, so close you could feel their breath on the back of your neck and then when you look around, nobody's there. - Hey. - What the fuck are you doing, man?! What is so important you gotta talk to me right now?! Are you crazy?! - You know, fuck this! You tell him. - Boss, the table in the back, they don't wanna pay the check. - Do you wanna die? - No. - Walk away. - Going to Clinton Road. - Yes. - Cheers. - So let me get this straight. You're some spiritual medium from Ohio and you're gonna talk to Jess using this hocus pocus stuff in the woods off of some haunted road in Jersey and find out what happened to her? - Not to be condescending but in layman's terms, yes. - Michael, you're okay with this? - Yeah. If it'll help Isabella and I move forward then what can it hurt? - Nobody asked your opinion, Tyler. - No but Michael's my friend and I have a right to look out for his best interests. - Tyler, you only think it's stupid because you don't understand it. - No, I think it's stupid because I think you and your new boyfriend here are trying to con my boy out of some money. Or are you telling me your boyfriend's doing this out of the kindness of his heart? - Well, it's typical for someone to get paid for services such as these. - Right. Oh and now it all becomes clear. - You know what, Tyler, none of this is your business anyway but Michael's not paying for anything, okay, I am and I invited him to come with me because we might finally find out what happened to my sister. Do you get off on being a arrogant fuck? Move! - You're just a skeptical asshole, Tyler. - And you're just some crazy hippy wannabe that's pimping out your new boyfriend for a buck. - Fuck you. - Guys, we're here to have fun. Just fun. - RJ, they made it here. - Hey, RJ, not fucking bad for an ex-cop. - Congratulations, Mister Mayor. - Thank you very much. - Who the fuck are you looking at? - Nobody important. - Yeah? - Hey, hey, calm down, dickhead, we're here to have a fucking good time, all right? - Enjoy yourself, come on. - Thank you. - Yeah, you're lucky you got elected. - Take it easy, he's the mayor now. - That shit's all in his head. - Makes my heard heavy to see somebody that doesn't understand the energies of the earth. - Listen, Begory, don't spit your spiritual shit out-- - I'm not finished. This process requires faith and focus. Neither of which you have. With you coming along, it jeopardizes all that for everyone else. - You done? - You know I am. - Good. And all I have to say is that I don't want my friend getting his hopes up and be disappointed. He's already been through a lot and it's my responsibility to make sure he doesn't get fucked over. - Good luck. - Luck? - Yeah, luck. - Hey, guys, Begory and I are gonna get out of here. - Cool, we're right behind you once we just pick up the bill. - You don't have to get the whole thing by yourself. Let me chip in. - No, no, no, I got it. - Well, at least let me tip. - Thanks, Gia. - Of course. I'm gonna talk to Is later and she's gonna fill you in on everything. - Okay. - Bye. Oh God, what the hell?! - Are you okay? - Oh shit, that hurt. - I'm so sorry, honey. - It's actually not that bad. No, it's not that bad. You're gonna need some more drinks before we go anywhere. Yeah. - Hi, good evening. - Dolores. - Yes, RJ's waiting for you. Have a great time. - Eric Roberts, I'm on the list. - You're not Eric Roberts, I know Eric. He's handsome and he's taller. And he's younger. - Wow. - Yeah, sorry. - I guess. - May I see? Oh, Mr. Roberts, I'm so sorry, I didn't even realize. - What's your name? - Shiane. - Call me Eric. - I'm so sorry. - It's all right. - I apologize, Mr. Roberts, please take care of him. - Why don't you keep this on your ear until you get home? - Can't I say with you tonight, baby? - Of course. Let me just get us a cab. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm good. Let's just get home. I got you some water. - Thanks, babe. - Of course. How're you feeling? - Okay. - Actually doesn't look that bad. - Really? - If you're okay, I'm gonna get a little work done at the desk before we go to bed. - Okay, I'm gonna grab a shower. Hey, babe. - Jesus. Babe, I thought you were taking a shower. - I was thinking that I wasn't quite ready enough to take a shower just yet. - I was just... - Baby? - Yeah, babe? - I changed my mind. - Now what? - I wanna come with you when you go with Isabella to talk to Jess. - Why? - Because you're my man. This is important to you. I love you. - I love you too, babe. Of course you can come. This is it. This is the last place anyone saw Jess. - I love getting out of the city, it's so freeing. - Yeah, the great outdoors. - All right, so what happens now, Gia? - Now we find Begory. - Okay. - Well, I hope you didn't pay this ghost whisperer because it looks like he's a no-show. - Knowing him, he probably walked here. - Actually, he's right there, leaning up against a tree. - Is he talking to that tree? - Didn't think we came out here to talk to trees. - Right? - Gia. I wanna say thank you for setting this whole thing up. I really appreciate it. - Oh, girl, anything for you. Well, that and I love watching him to his voodoo shit, it's so hot. - What? - He gets so serious and sweaty. - Please tell me this isn't gonna turn into some weird drug-induced love in thing. - No, babe, he's a legit witch doctor. I wouldn't do this if I wasn't like 60 percent sure he could do it. I mean, we might go fuck in the woods after but it's all business first. - That's very reassuring. You actually have done this with him before, right, Gia? - You mean contact a spirit? - Yeah. - Yeah, we contacted my dead granny. - Really? - Yeah. It was amazing. - How did you know it was actually her? - It was her, trust me. He's amazing, okay? It'll be good. - Here. - Really? Right here? - Fire goes here. - Isn't a fire gonna piss off all these tree? - Oh come on, babe, I'm sorry but that was funny as shit. - You know what, this is actually sort of serious for some of us, so if you two are gonna keep making jokes and fucking around then why don't you just go sit in the truck together? - I thought it was a pretty legitimate question. - It's not. - All right, fine, I'll shut up. - Shit. - What's wrong? - My phone. I think I left it in the car. Babe, can you go get it for me? - Yeah, sure. Keys. "Babe, will you get my phone?" Sure. Holy shit, you scared the fuck out of me! - That wasn't my intention. - How may I help you? Are we okay to park here? - There's absolutely no camping in this area. - That's good. We're not camping. - No fires. - Understood. - Most importantly, stick to the road. - Yeah. Yeah, it's just me and some friends, you know, hiking. No camping, no fires. - Stick to the road. - The road? What the fuck? Keys. - Not the best time for selfies. - Yeah, babe, come on. - Whatever. There's no reception here anyway. - Is this normal, Gia? - Gianna, is this normal? Gianna? - Huh? - Is he okay, should we do something? - I don't know. - What's he saying? - Sounds like French. - I don't speak French. - Baby, are you okay? Baby? - If I had a signal we could use Google Translate. Hashtag, "fucked up shit in the woods." - Kayla, what the hell, seriously? Put your goddamn phone away and show some respect. Kayla. I'm sorry. Kayla. You can't just go walking off. - Stay here, bro. Take care of this shit. Kayla, hold up! - Damn it. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. - Michael, we don't know that, okay? We need to be patient. All right? Maybe something is gonna happen. - I gotta get some air. - Michael. Michael, come on. Gia, you got this? - I'm good, girl. - Michael. - Kayla, be careful. Kayla, hold on! Just relax. He didn't mean that. - Yeah, he did. Such an asshole sometimes. - No, he's really stressed right now. - Oh yeah, well I came all the way out here for him so he should be showing a little more appreciation, don't you think? - Yes, I agree. Listen, I've got a lot of respect for you coming all the way out here. - You're so nice. Michael's lucky to have a friend like you. - Any friend of Michael's is a friend of mine too. - I have something to admit. - What's that? - I didn't come out here to support Michael and search for his missing wife. - No? Why'd you come? - Selfish reasons. - There's nothing I can think of less selfish than helping someone find closure. - Yeah, it's that but-- - But what? - It's nothing, I'm just being stupid. - Come on. - I thought... What if... What if he found her? - She's been missing awhile. If she hasn't turned up by now, I really don't think she's going to. - Okay. What about Isabella? - Is? What about her? - I don't know. They're close. - Really? You think Michael came all the way out here to hook up with his missing wife or her sister? - It's stupid and selfish, I told you. - Look, Michael likes you. He's with you and he's loyal. You have nothing to worry about. - Thanks. That means a lot. - Am I totally insane for bring us out into the middle of the woods for this? - No. It's a beautiful sentiment. I'm not sure that Begory is the right man for the job. - Are you shitting me? We have a dude back there who is convulsing on the ground and speaking in tongues. Do you know of a better guy for the job? - Feels good to laugh with you. - I'm glad you're still in my life, Michael. You are still an awesome brother-in-law. - And you're a neurotic workaholic with crazy ideas. - Okay, you can just-- - Did you hear that? - Yeah, what was that? Wow. - Looks like an old fireplace. - It's actually a foundry. - Like for a smith? - Yeah, I mean I guess so but it doesn't look like it's been used in like a hundred or 200 years. Okay, I am ready to get back now, Michael. - Yeah, I'm one step ahead of you. - I saw a mechanic. His daughter. This iron worker. A boy in the water. - What're you talking about, baby? - The purest evil and those who were wrongfully killed and then tricked. They were tricked, these people, they were tricked into thinking that the only way they'd be able to pass on by collecting the souls of the damned. - You're not making any sense. - Fuck! This place is fucking so evil! They're not gonna let us leave here. We gotta get out. - Then let's go, let's get the fuck out of here. I just wanna go, I just wanna leave, I wanna get the fuck out of here! - We can't go yet. Were the fuck is my satchel? - What the fuck is that? - What? - I don't know, it's like something dropping into the water. You don't hear that? Yeah, did you just see that? It's like a little pebble or something falling off the bridge. - Maybe someone's fishing from the bridge. - I don't know. Let's go check that out. - Are you sure this is the way that we came? - I thought so. It's just dark, it's hard to tell. - It feels like we've been walking far enough we should be back already. - Totally. I just can't see anything, we must've got turned around. - Let's just make sure we're going the right way. And not that way. - Agreed. Hey, look. - What's that? - Headlights. If there's a car, there's a road. I vote we go that way. - Agreed. - What the fuck? Check this out. Coins. - That's weird. That must've been what was splashing into the water. - Yeah but how, they're just sitting. - The wind? - It's definitely what I heard. - Don't see anything over there. - A squirrel. - A what? - A squirrel. You know, those little fuzzy tree rats? - I know what a squirrel is. Maybe a squirrel came running-- - What was that? - What the fuck? Holy shit! There's a kid in the water! - Oh my God, Tyler, hurry! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! - Kayla, where's the kid?! - He's right there! - Where?! - He's right there! - Kayla, where?! - Tyler, he's right there! Hurry, he's gonna drown! - Kayla, where?! - Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Tyler?! Got him! - Come on, come on, come on, please! - What the fuck?! - Tyler? - Kayla! - Tyler! - Fuck! Help! - Somebody! Somebody, help, please! Somebody! Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. - Hold on. Michael, there's absolutely no way that those lights were this far off. - I was just thinking the same thing. - How could we have possibly missed the road? - I don't know. It was a car or truck lights. I just don't understand how they drove through here. - What? - Listen. - Is that? - Sounds like a crackling of a fire, right? I think it's coming from over there. That has to be them. Right? - Baby, can we just leave? I wanna get out of here. - No, I have to figure this out. Oh, shit. Gianna? Gianna?! - What?! - Where are my notes? - I don't know, they're in your bag. - No, no, no, they were in the car, I said put them in my bag. Could you have left them in the car? - Maybe, I don't know. - Fuck! You're gonna have to go get them. - You want me to go out there alone? - I can't leave here. I need them to cleanse this place and cleanse ourselves. It's the only way we're gonna get out of here. - I feel like we are walking in circles. We should've come across a trail or the road or anything by now. I don't know, maybe we should be going towards the pounding. Maybe that's part of Begory's thing. Shit, I just-- - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Do you smell that? Smoke. - Okay. It's right there. - All right. Let's get to the others and get the hell out of here. - Finally. - Show yourselves. Show yourselves. Show yourselves. Show yourselves. - I'm sorry that I dragged us our here. - No, that's fine. Just not do it again. Let's chalk it up and move on. - Agreed. What? - How could we? - There's a little girl. Sweetheart. Sweetheart, do you live around here? Sweetheart, we're a little lost and we're trying to find our friends and get back to our car. And we just are looking for someone to help us. Do you know where you parents are? - Go, go, go, go, go! - Michael! Michael! - Come on. Come on. - Show yourselves. Show yourselves. Where are you? Show yourselves. - Michael, what was that? Was is that back there? What is that fucking noise? - I don't know. We gotta get out of here. - Michael, where? We're just running around in circles. We're completely lost. - No we're not, look, it's a bridge. The ranger said stick to the road. We got this. It's like 50 steps and we're there. Come on, let's go. - Let's go, let's go. - Wait! - What? What is it? - Looks like Tyler's shorts. Tyler! - Tyler! - Ty! - Tyler! - Tyler! - Tyler! - Ty! - Tyler! Tyler! Michael! - Oh my God! - Michael, no, Michael! - Is! - Michael! Oh my God, Michael! Michael! What was it that got you?! Are you okay, what just happened? - Something grabbed me. - What? What do you mean, something grabbed you? What do you mean? - Let's just get out of here before we find out. - Are you okay? Are you okay? - Let's just get to the road. - Okay. I got you, I got you. - Oh, fuck. Okay. Check this. Got it. - You got it? Okay, just watch out for this. - I can't go any further, hold on. Oh, it really hurts. - Let me look, come here. Let me take a look. Oh my God. - Is it bad? - It's really bad. - Okay. Oh, fuck. Oh, thank you. - Michael? - Yeah. - I wanna go home. I wanna go home. - I know. Me too. Let's just get to the others and get the fuck out of here. We never crossed a bridge. So Tyler's truck has got to be that way. - I am not going back into the woods, Michael. - I understand. Walk right down this road. It's gotta go to the other road, the main road. Once we get to the others, we'll figure it out from there, okay? - Okay. Okay. - Help me up. You got this, come on. - Okay. - Okay. - Stop, do you hear that? - What? What is that? - It sounds like a little girl. - It's a trick, ignore it. - No, it's not, Michael, I can hear her. - She's not real. Keep walking. - "Go to the vehicle and get my things." How dare he talk to me like that. How the fuck am I supposed to get into the truck without any keys? Asshole. Begory? Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Help! Somebody help! Help! - Was that? - Come on. - Please help me, God. Help me! Please! - Run! - Gianna! - Is! Oh my God! We need to run! We need to run! We need to get the fuck out of here! - Okay, calm down, calm down. Slow down, what's going on? - You don't understand. There was a girl in the woods and Begory is dead. - A girl wearing a dress? - Yes and I threw a rock at her. Another guy-- - Begory is dead, are you sure? - Yes, we need to get the fuck out of here! - Okay, all right, we're together. We're together now. Michael, we need to go. - Yeah, we're going. - Where's Kayla and Tyler? - We don't know, we haven't seen them. - We found Tyler's shorts in the river down by the bridge. - What bridge? - There's a bridge that way. - Begory was saying something about a boy and a bridge and a man and a truck and he wasn't making any sense. I'm not going anywhere near any fucking bridge! - We're not going back to the bridge either, don't worry. We're just gonna stick near the truck and wait for somebody to drive by. - Why are we gonna wait? Why don't we just leave? - No keys. Listen, they know we're here. - Who knows we're here? - When I came to get Kayla's phone, a forest ranger came and he was suspicious about us camping in the woods. I'm sure he's gonna come back and make sure that we aren't. We're as good as out of here. Hey! Hey! - Help! - Hey! - Help! Help! - He's not stopping! Hey! Hey! What the fuck?! Yeah, you? - Gianna?! - I'm okay! - Gianna! No! - No! No! No! No! Come back! Come back! No! No! No! We need to get help! - She needs help! - No! No! No! We need to get help! - How are we gonna get help, Michael?! - We're gonna walk out of here. Straight down this fucking road. Come on. - Gia! You okay? - It just hurts. Just tie it tighter. - We're gonna get you back, we're gonna get you straight to a hospital, okay, Michael? - Maybe to a priest too. Don't! Don't! - Michael? What the fuck is that? - They want us to run. - Why? - I don't know. But I'm done running. We have to get going. Shit, shit, shit. It's okay, he's gone, let's go. - I can't take this anymore. - We have to be close to someone. Come on. - Michael. - Finally. - Come on. We're gonna go get some help and then we're gonna go back and we're gonna get our Gianna, okay? - Okay. - Okay, almost there. - Oh, shit. - Almost there. Hello?! Hello?! - Hello?! - Hello?! Is there anyone there? Come on! Come on! - Who leaves the door open? - Hello, is there anybody there? Please, we need help! Can we come in, please?! Please?! Michael, please. Anywhere is fucking better than out there. I can't be in the woods anymore! I can't be on that road anymore, okay?! Look, this is a good place. We'll just get you off your foot and we'll check it out and we'll just wait, we'll wait until the morning, until the sun comes up, and then we'll go back out to the road and wait for someone to come, okay? Let's just go inside. - All right. - Okay? Please. - It wouldn't hurt to get off my foot. - Okay, come on. Come on. Just a little bit farther. All right, we're gonna get you sat down and comfortable. - Take it slow, take it slow. - You got it. - Look. - There's a fire. - Somebody must be here. - Hello? - Hello? - Come on, come on. Put you right here. Okay. - Take your time. - Okay. Are you okay? - I'm good. - Hello? Is there anybody here? Hello? Hello? Hello? - Isabella. - Jess? Jess, is that you? - Michael. - Jessica? Jess? Jess! Jess? Jess. Jess? I missed you so much. - Jess! - That's Kayla! Kayla! - Help! Help, somebody! Help, is anybody around, fuck?! - Kayla! - Michael? - Kayla! Kayla, it's me, babe! - Michael, oh my God, is that really you, Michael? Isabella? - Michael! - No! Isabella! Isabella! Kayla. - Michael! - Kayla! Run! - Michael! - Kayla! Help. Help me. Is? Is! Is? Is? Is? Is. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Oh my God. Don't! No! I'll be back. - Michael. Michael, Michael, Michael. Michael. Michael, Michael. - I can't! - Michael, Michael, Michael. - No more!

What was he even saying? - Just some drunk gibberish. - Too much tequila, I guess. - Yeah. - You trying to scare the panties off of me? - I didn't think you were wearing any. - Maybe I'm not. - Surprise, surprise. I did scare the panties off you, huh? What the fuck?! - Oh my God, there's a little girl outside. - Where? I don't see anything. - I swear, she was right there looking right in here, all creepy looking little girl. - Babe, babe, we're miles away from the closest home. There I no way there's a kid on this road. - I know what I saw. What're you doing? - I'm gonna go check it out. - No, don't go out there, please. - I'm going. - No, John, stay here. No, don't go out there. - Babe, seriously, look at me. I'm pretty sure the kid sees me, I'm gonna scare 'em off. Okay? - John! John! Oh my God! Oh my God!
