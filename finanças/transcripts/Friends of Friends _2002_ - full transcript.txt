- You better not resist - I'm not Careful, my cellphone is in there - Did he say something? - What did you say? - Shut up That day the three louts robbed me behind the gym in Traunstein while I had to grin about it like a complete idiot is in my memory because of something else It was the day when Arthur first started at our school The Friends' Friends And Corinna, that stupid bitch, let him do it, even though she knew exactly Thomas is such a wanker - You don't know it? - No, really, I don't Sure you do, it's that feeling that there's some person out there we belong to Or who just matches you, you know? And that that person may even be really close by Boarding School Schlossstein Of course, I wil go get him immediately You know what's going on with him? His father died yesterday, while we were on the mountain - Was he ill or something? - Just old, I think. Apparently old enough to have seen Hitler in the flesh His mother is really young though Here. Careful, it's still wet Thanks That'll be a thousand Mark Knock before you enter the bathroom Lock the door if it bothers you You having a drink? Do I look stupid? What's all this? Cow watching You like staring at the forest, don't you? It's all I do. Why? You also did it when we went skiing Was that really your mother in the Merc? Of course. Why? Well she seems really young, compared with your father The old man wanted to become rich first and then take his pick He married her when she was 20, then they had my brother and me right after She agreed it, the two had an understanding My sister was born later, no accident either Sure, I'd just wondered When I was staring into the woods on the ski trip, was there anyone else From our group I mean No. Why? Well there was someone else On that day my father died, but I didn't know it then But at the moment of his death he stood before me in those woods I'm not fooling around. He was really there. In an ancient winter coat that I've only ever seen in a photo He was wearing that and looking calmly at me What? Really And what did he die of? Nothing. Old age. Listen, nobody needs to know, ok? Or they'll start parading in sheets below my window. I really don't need that. I understand - Can I get a Coke? - Sure Who's she? Who? - The dark one - The negro? Not available With the dark hair She isn't from our school, is she? Oh her, she's Veronika's friend I think Why, you know her? - Veronika, do the Limbo - Limbo yourself Are you actually paying Billy for helping out? And? Going to finish that? What's it to you if I give her a little something for her help? I didn't know she was hard-up She certainly doesn't need stupid questions I didn't mean anything by it Of course it'll be worth it Don't be a girl and get yourself over here And how, on foot? In any case, you're lying I bet it stinks and you just want a drinking budy I've drunk plenty already Yeah I can tell But there's this girl I think someone saw me on the toilet Tall guy A girl huh? Why didn't you say so? What's her name? How would I know? She's great Well congratulations But I'll stay here and jerk myself off if that's ok with you I guess Don't look at it - But you gave me some already - I know. This is for your cab. Thanks for everything Did you call for a cab? - Yes - I've been waiting for ten minutes Better get out I won't have anyone throwing up in my car Have a nice evening So... was that your cab? Possible. Why? Because someone had ordered that cab I didn't mean to pinch your cab That's fine, I've saved some money My car is around here somewhere, if you guys need to get home You can drive? Better not, it's just that I thought maybe...can you drive? Yes my pleasure What's your name? Billie And this is Mario So shall I drive? Could you drop me off at my boarding school? - Because they can get rather upset - Sure It's not that far Only if it's no hassle You've Mario Once he's asleep he stays asleep That way you can keep the car until tomorrow Fine Shall we? I don't have the key. She just called to say that she left it at the Venezia So did she attend our school or not? Yeah, she did But not for long. I never had much to do with her back then And then the rumour of her pregnancy And then she was gone, didn't even graduate Today the rumour is called Mario, whom you know already - What time is it? - I don't have a watch anymore Then I'll wait for the cleaner She married the father He works something with books and computers Maybe he ran a publishing house But that went belly-up rather quickly They drank a lot back then, both of them She's been bankrupt for quite some time He's even in jail, I think She doesn't talk about it, but it appears that she's paying off the debt She's strange like that If she hired a lawyer she wouldn't still be paying it off She says she pays because she was wrong about him And what's that accent of hers? She's from Lausanne in Switzerland That blouse you're wearing Was that hers? Bingo And I'd hoped you were looking at Belonged to Billie, nice, isn't it? I wear it for cleaning Yes that's it. Thanks. - Hello - Hi I forgot to tell them where I parked you car Anyway, you made it in time No, pure chance, I was passing by and saw you and then I remembered Down that way You dropped off the key and left and - now you're back - What does it matter, I'm here now Can you give me a lift quickly? Look, there's Gregor. Say 'Hi' Ah I heard your voice, I couldn't reach you on the phone This month's food fees still need paying, if you got it now we won't have to mail you I'm sorry I don't have that much on me Too bad, but I can't give you another reprieve - How much is it? - 82 Mark Sabine, could you join us, please Thanks, I'll get your change - Mom I want to go - Yes we are going Thanks Look what's in there Take them Can't eat with those Use your hands then Or like that It's yummy I even attended your school, back when you had also started You don't remember? We were there together for maybe two months And we later saw one another at a party We even danced together Really? Maybe two years ago? We went for a stroll after I don't recall Was I drunk? A little Both of us Did we kiss? No I remember all this because I told you something back then And what? You don't remember? Well I was drunk. So what was it about? Not something to tell twice. I had a friend at school. Melanie. You don't know her. She left before you started. I was doing laundry at night. Jamais And suddenly there she was Just a few steps away We didn't say anything Don't know how long it lasted, not very I think Two days later I found out that that was her time of death Many kilometres away She lived in Zurich and had a car accident that night You sure you told me this? Sure I didn't tell that many folks about this That's odd because If you weren't there, probably Did I believe you back then? Sure, you were drunk Well then I believe you now also And where did we go for the walk? The path up above the castle the narrow way next to the riding path Where? The alley behind the wall You must know it But there is no path But that's where we were I want to see you again Only if you want to, too, I mean Alright? Of course That's Walter, a friend of my husband He owes him money And who's that? Later she came out like after ten minutes Then they drove to a hotel at the edge of town Don't know it They were in there for maybe half an hour and then came back out They argued about something but I couldn't hear them So where's this path supposed to be? Why are we out here when we should be in the basement drinking beer? You know what she told me? That she had a similar experience to yours An apparition That she saw someone A friend who'd died - So what do you say? - What do you want me to say? I guess it happens Never heard of another person to whom it has happened But I guess it happens In women it means that they're wicked in bed Yeah sure I don't know her, of course But maybe you're not the one she's after So who else? Well Maybe it's not your cock but your money that she wants Look Is this the path? That's it So this is where This is where you two laid down and Rubbish, we didn't even snog I don't believe you Well it's what she says Why don't you check her out for me? These affairs are never predictable Maybe we can all meet and I'll leave briefly, to make a call or And then you could talk Maybe you could work out what she thinks of me You want expert appraisal? Sure, can do You've something in common, after all, this supernatural business It won't be odd if you tag along Maybe she'll even think it really cool that I know you If it helps you can also tell her that I've got three balls I think I could touch some part of her blindfolded and I'd know it was her Even though I've never touched her And what if she gets you to father a child Because that's make her rather smart Once you see her you won't think like that I'm meeting her in four days, will you come? This is her letter-box She's gone Nobody lives up there It's empty, only advertising A beer, please You ever seen a female thief in the flesh? No I was on the toilet five minutes ago When I came back I noticed Shit, my money is gone I got rubbers from the vending machine And forgot my wallet there So I went back to check and it was gone And only she went to the toilet after me Wait a moment Hi I think you forgot something. Right? I don't thinks so Something that doesn't belong to you And what would that be? Better take a seat Fine, now what? Now we'll check I know this one Doesn't belong to you I guess we'll have to call the cops Please don't Couldn't we sort this out some other way? I just had an issue with the cops. They nabbed me at the department store I took some things - Oh, a felon - And then they searched my flat And found my gun I guess we'll come to an arrangement Heads or tails? If you lose you get undressed and dance on the table Your call. Strip or the cops. Fine F-7 And what about my beer? Can't you play something else? So get to it Kiss me Anything you command And now him Ok. This is Pia. You're a dick And you believed the whole thing? In three months we're out of here So is this your girlfriend? Just a friend As much yours as mine There no longer is a 'mine' and 'yours' You can forget all that when you genuinely fall in love - When that happens - But it won't So you think it won't happen to you? What would you like? Love? Don't know what to expect from you Love? Love? Ooh delicious. Chanel or some shit like that. Shall I read? Give it back! Do what you want It's from Veronika - I know that - Can't she phone or email? Why a letter? Veronika is a mother, she doesn't use computers. Your sweetheart has resurfaced She says, "Can you ask him" "To meet me again. I dare not call. Maybe he's mad at me." - Don't go - Why not? Maybe she just ran out of money again My head has its own mind, it's out of my control In that case I'm sorry I needed some time away from Walter How much do you owe him still? Pretty exactly 10,000 Mark He lent us money when the bank wouldn't anymore I don't have any, so I said yes when he proposed our deal at the hotels So who are the victims of your scheme? Do you sleep with them? Never Just older men who pass through They're gone the next day Really Well I go up to their room But if I can't get at their wallet right away I leave What? I thought, maybe I can help you out It's not unheard of to help someone What do you think? You found the path where we went for that walk? Yes. Why? Just a thought I've to go. Come visit me? Sure Let's go, alright? Oh, mustn't kiss you on the mouth. You're friends, after all. But everywhere else. Come here, don't be a chicken Stay there, keep going What now, you don't like her? - Sure she does - Or have you never seen a woman? Sure, lots Fine. Two. Three, actually But it was...complicated every time And now you're in love and everything has changed, right? Exactly Change of subject? - Sure - Of course Pia, tell us something about Munich Munich is a town like any other You'll find out once you attend university in autumn If he can pass his exams, sure. Otherwise I'll go on my own. Have a drink. Women are not interested in city discussions. Hey look at me Don't make such a fuss See? Pia's dead. I can see that Now what? Dig a hole and put her in it? I think she's still alive We have to kiss her awake What are you doing here? Sweet. No school today? Not exactly, free time to study for exams I called you But your cell phone was turned off Bit complicated because I use that phone booth over there Why that? They disconnected my phone again Coming in? Listen, have you half an hour? And this goes back to you Is that your father's signature? Yes Both strong and weak This is your account certificate And here proof of the first deposit What does this mean? The persons who may access the account. In this case that means only you. Would it be possible that both of us get access? Why me? In case you change your mind. But why would I? Feelings can change. Yours or mine? Yours and mine. Feelings in general. Let's make it so we both can access it Hey, you asleep? That's ok, we're here now I wanted you to meet Arthur We share the room The same thing happened to him that happened to you When you saw your dead girlfriend In his case he'd seen his father I was there Didn't see the father though, just Arthur - 87 or 81 - 81 - Hit the key? - No, as it is Hello? Is he asleep? Ok And did he eat anything? I think one cannot fall in love It's the other way around And it's no use waiting for it I think When the time comes one just stands there And love is standing there And if it's real love one will recognise it Time stops then, that's eternal It must feel as if one had never waited at all But love made a mistake between you and your husband? I'm sorry I haven't slept with anyone in a long time Let me start You're beautiful Morning - Morning - Morning Morning You too, Monsieur Arthur I'm not coming back a second time, alright? That was close He nearly saw you, he thought you're Arthur Good morning Hello Don't Look at me Stop it! Notebooks under the table now, please And pass around the covered sheets You know who saved your neck this morning? - Who? - Billie Really. Perbacher came in, saw just her hair and thought it was you. - Where'd you go this time? - Munich We'll change the seating order for the exams Everybody has three worksheets? I guess you can thank her some time Anytime Good luck I wouldn't demand this had you been more cautious But stupidity is the last thing we need here Anybody who is going to fail the exams is a surplus to this school Every time you left the grounds without permission Someone managed to spy on you - And who was that? You don't expect me to respond, do you? Don't consider your exams a done deal I can suspend you from school at any time Good morning Tetrachluorhexine Huh? Tetrachluorhexine What page are you on? 94 So go back two pages, don't know what that's related to Can't you switch to voicemail when I'm explaining things? That's my attorney Balance: 9,590 Mark Five beers, thanks What are you doing here? I got cabin fever So I said, yeah let's meet the guys Nothing much happening anyway I'm a friend of Pia. Daniel. Take a seat. You're Gregor, right? And what are you up to? We're starting a small business That assists other businessmen We offer streamlining advice Like engineers You could say that Fine-tuners That's all we need to say Could I have that back, please? Graduation exams 2001 Good luck This number is not in operation Please check the number He hasn't heard anything from her in two weeks She only called once and asked whether I could look after Mario, but I didn't have any time and she was in a rush Her neighbour told me a removal van was there a few days ago She told me "If there's a chance to leave my husband" "And to get Mario a better future" "Then I'll do that" I'm sorry, Gregor What does that mean, "a better future"? It doesn't mean you in any case "Leave her husband" To the arctic or what does that mean? Don't know exactly. It's possible her husband is being released soon. She didn't want to talk about it, but that would be a reason to leave. I'm going to study in Munich anyway Just you? I thought the two of you Only if he passes the exams and it doesn't look good at all I offered the gods an ox for the graduation party An ox? Sure - What? - Listen to yourself Sure. You're invited. Arthur, I'm really in love with you Gregor, we met at a bad time At least in my case You strongly believe that there's someone for everyone And that feeling is a permanent bond between us I wanted to tell you this in person and to say goodbye But I only reached your voicemail and after I didn't find the time Please be a dear and do not look for me I'm sorry it had to happen like this Billie Why can something that has disappeared hurt so much? Shit Can anyone tell me?! That's what the Legionnaires say It means to be gone or sick Like a night terror And then it's gone I still don't know French Crap, you never even met MUNICH 3 months later You always talk, talk, all that crap For three days we've been talking the same shit - Don't shout - But I feel like it The same shit for three days What's the point, I'd rather leave - I'll jump - Do it then - No - Leave me alone - Please come down - Go inside That's insane, you're totally crazy Fuck fuck fuck Crap Shit You got ice? I sprained it I don't Won't help now anyway What's the matter with you? Pia has been here for three days and we keep talking and talking And at some stage I stopped listening and jumped out the window instead You've lost it Another one of your Brought home another one again did you? What's good about traffic jams is it's quiet time, time to think And? And what did you conclude? That your car's heating is crap And that love does not last A day, or two at the most - I've to go - Already? - But you said in an hour - I know, but I don't want to rush You got the key? Good, can you lock up When you've had your rest from Pia, I mean Nuh, I'll leave the door wide open for everyone to see your flat And take your fairy scarf, alright If you insist But it's not mine Bye Hi I thought you'd missed your train I couldn't get a seat up the front Where's Mario? - Is he well? - Yes My sister is looking after him while I'm gone At first I was embarassed to call you out of the blue like that I'm off See you later - You know your way around - Yes It's high time I got out of there I finally went to see a lawyer four months ago I don't want Mario to see his father I want a divorce But I need someone Who can testify that my husband assaulted me The court date is tomorrow And if everything goes according to plan If you help me with this It can be over Tell me what I need to do It's just that My husband doesn't even speak to me We communicate via correspondence only And the latest is that he won't agree to the divorce after all But when I see my lawyer in the morning I'll tell her that you've agreed That you'll testify And after that nothing bad can happen Fine Thanks I'm free Gregor It's nothing, I fell off the bike Nearly healed You really want to? Certainly not with you. Never. Look. That's us. I'd so wished for this. Since summer. And now there you are I think it's better you left before Kathrin comes back - Doesn't she like me? - No But she was in love with me once and she can't forget it That's how she is You can stay at my place We wanted to catch up after all this time Pick me up in the morning? We can go to the courthouse together You afraid you won't find it? What? No. I just don't want to run into my husband You busy, is it a bad time? Come in He says before someone else does it he'd rather kill himself You promised nothing untoward would happen You said we'd talk That we'd come to an arrangement That's what we said, yes I'm no longer interested I know what to do and you may not like it Hung up on me Well this is a problem How is it my problem? I went but he didn't show You were late So what? It's 400km to Frankfurt, being late can happen We've been talking for 3 hours without result Then that coward calls about his bullshit He isn't the problem It's like this, he's out of control He'll call the cops because you're losing it I'll be in touch Now get lost, I want to take a shower Right, let's go I love showering Why're you here, what's up? Guess where I'm coming from Dunno, from home? I met Billie Oh really, she's still around? Listen to me She called 3 days ago to say she was in town She's staying at a friend's place I think you know her, it's that Lesbian, Kathrin I know her from the bakery I had a thing with a girl who lived in the same street Maybe even in the same building And so what's happening, why didn't you tell me? You don't tell me everything either She's in court tomorrow for her divorce and wants my help To testify against her husband - And are you? - Of course Not bad Could be something in it for you Or were there certain benefits already? We slept together Congratulations And? Dunno It's looking really good So how about you take a look at her, finally Sure, but why right now? Seems ok at the moment We're in court at 2pm Maybe at the caf? at 3? Why not, that'll work So, want to get drunk? Do me a favour first? I need this signature down here And then on these cheques Ok if I take a seat? Yes, of course I didn't see you How're things? Something the matter? I'm feeling sad for Arthur That's not really true, I'm sad for myself But I'm concerned What's going on with him? I know he's always had affairs And I can't get used to that But lately he hasn't been himself Every day he disappears a little more And that's how it is He disappears. Always on the road To some place or other Did you know he was in Genua ten days ago and collapsed in the street? Does he tell you this stuff? All I know is that he was in Italy for a day I fear he's burning up And no longer sleeps with me either He told me he went to a s?ance And that the woman had summoned her dead girlfriend And he's slept with her and since All the spirits of dead women He slept with have risen and are sucking him dry Every night He calls it 'fucking ghosts' At that mansion There was that one woman Who'd also tagged along to the castle - But they didn't do it, that's nonsense - Of course it is nonsense He's only talking crap so he won't need to have a normal conversation We were all pretty disoriented at some stage There was this black hole after the exams But now you know how to go on Don't tell him we spoke Promise me you'll talk some sense to him Good to know you're a friend He's leaving me I'm certain of that Do me a favour? Take a picture of him for me? None exist Will you do that? Yes What is it? That's my husband over there I don't want to see him Why? I've to tell you something else You no longer need to testify When I told her she was a little peeved about the late revelation She also said it wouldn't be advantageous Because I have doctor's certificates - From the doctor? - I got treatment a few times after he'd beaten me Good day We're up in two minutes So what are you going to do next? I don't know yet It's all too recent But I can probably get a job in Regensburg That will probably be good for now Thank you I didn't do anything For being there today Mario is free of him He's not even allowed in his presence For three years And then Mario will be 7 And already I imagine what high school to send him to Why not move to Munich? Would you like that? Of course - But I don't have to decide today? - No, of course not I thought Maybe in three or four years It is I It's half past three I'm at the caf?, out there is the square and the fountain Just as always, and you're nowhere to be seen you shit But I no longer need your expert opinion - When did he say he'd be here? - At three, he's late Do you have to go? You're not leaving until tomorrow Kathrin and I are going to the cinema There's something at the Audimax she really wants to see - I can give you a lift - Don't worry I can find it by myself You were in Munich? Six or seven weeks ago On a Sunday I called but only got your answering machine Should I call tonight? We could go out Sure, I'll be at home I'll find you Thanks for being on time Can I stay here tonight? If you like. Why? Well, maybe - Are you expecting someone? - Maybe, yes So you're well? I've to go for a few days It's best if nobody knows - Do whatever you like - Yeah yeah, I know I broke it off with Pia We kept talking Well, she did most of it And then she cried Then more talking, it wouldn't stop But that's finished now What about the divorce? That was simple - Where's she now? - Out somewhere with Kathrin Leaving Munich when? Early tomorrow Then it's tonight Huh? I'll meet you two tonight You want me to call her for you? I'll do it No, she'll call eventually Also, I don't know where they are I called in a Pizza, you want any? Are you nuts? Who's that for, the cops? Thanks for those signatures When you came around yesterday things weren't looking good They only behaved because you were there We'd been arguing for three hours Mostly about money, about my share But I don't have any money My father left everything to my mother and my siblings I got one of his businesses. His pet project for me For his trouble child What a dick The business is a consulting firm It's successful due to its confidentiality Even if it knows of a client's ruthless practices How can someone like myself be the owner of such a firm?! I've abused as much as possible the firm's store of information Frank and the others and I, we all entered into this bargain If we had spoken openly it would have sounded like this The guy in Frankfurt is being blackmailed By us He's a wanker He's a tax fraud And the firm that is now mine has assisted him And we're tormenting him with that knowledge The problem is that one afternoon his daughter got me so horny She's 13 or 14 So I slept with her, it was just too good It was so right at that moment But her old man is out in the cold He's become unpredictable Since he knows I banged his daughter Shit It is I Just letting you know that Kathrin and I are going out to eat Where are you now? In her flat We'll be in your area later on Schanzenbar Ok where? At the Schanzenbar Want to meet there? She can't stay But will accompany me there Fine, around ten? So is that ok with your - At ten? - Yes 10 is fine Hello? Ten is fine Your pal coming along, too, this time? Can he make it? Hang on Hi, legendary Billie. This is Arthur I can hardly wait Hello Mr. Arthur The phantom I thought we can't avoid one another forever And this is the last chance Looks like it, took long enough - See you later then - You sure? Yes Hung up. How was I? Got a photo of her? It's for the best you didn't become a photographer You nervous? Listen, you're not 15 anymore Don't drive yourself into a state You're on a nice stretch but that's all for now There's nothing special between men and women Sure there is, maybe not for you The question is who pities the other more? You me or me you? I'll be on time Did you use it while I was gone? Once I did it with a homeless chick, Pia wasn't meant to know A homeless And when? - I was here in August - You were in Munich? Six or seven weeks ago You're Kathrin? Billie can't get to the phone We've got a date for 10pm Can you tell her something came up Schanzenbar is closed today, too, I think I'll come to your place at 10.30. Let her know, please? Yes, 10.30 Is it ok for me to be here? Why wouldn't it be? Sorry we couldn't meet earlier But something came up once again I tried to call you You weren't at home That's not correct It's my fault we didn't all meet tonight I made up that he couldn't make it I didn't want you to meet Why? He knows so much about me And he talks too much when he's drunk All these months I've waited to hear from you I was afraid he'd tell you that I was embarrassed by that And I was afraid that you and Arthur would instantly fall in love if you met And now I'm embarrassed for stopping our meeting earlier It was probably the last chance for some time I know He has to go somewhere I know I'm certain he'll be sad about this, too I'm sorry But why? I did meet him He came here You didn't miss him by much He just left How can that be, what was he doing here? He sat there Just like you are now He can't have been Sure Kathrin had left And I accompanied her down the stairs - And I think I left the door open - You sure? Yeah I left it open And when I came back in There he was Just like you are now How did you recognise him? You've never met I knew right away it was him anyway You've talked so much about him And what did you talk about? Nothing We hardly spoke He didn't stay long Then he had to leave again I'm leaving in the morning My train is at quarter to nine Take me to the train? Yes I'll pick you up Arthur is dead For god's sake, say something What can I say? A man shot him dead at his flat I tried to call him, but by then he was already dead That's what the policeman told me who answered the phone Then he wanted to know who I am and the police was here, too When did all this happen? When? When did he die exactly? I don't know, the policeman said half past ten I think Or maybe later, no idea You just missed him He just left He'd even called me from the bar He was still alive then Now that he is dead a photo of Arthur exists It's a police photo I finally saw it when they interrogated me, as they did everyone he knew But there isn't much to see on it and what can be seen doesn't resemble him The police told me his time of death I measured the time between Kathrin's and my place on foot and on the bicycle And in a cab I turned it over and over in my head whether he could have reached her in time To talk to her and return home on time for his death But it is just more likely that he didn't visit Billie I maintain that somewhere out there is someone for everyone But I wasn't that someone for Billie I did not see Billie again Only four years later did I get some news about her Apparently she took the job in Regensburg She was fired after a few weeks. It was alleged she had stolen. Don't know if that's true, it makes no difference The following spring she died in an accident In a bicycle crash Mario went into his father's care. He is fine. In retrospect it seems to me that from that night on Billie had suspended herself, waiting for something I don't know if Billie ever found out that Arthur died that night There was no need to tell her I am certain she knew From that night on, when Arthur appeared at the flat From that moment on She followed an irresistable call Subtitles by stefflbw for KG (2010)
