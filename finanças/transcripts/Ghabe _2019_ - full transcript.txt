- Hi. - Hi. - Good trip? - Good. - Hello. - Hi. Do they speak any Swedish? No, only English. Okay, okay. Come! This is Calle. He has been so kind to lend you his cabin over the summer. Welcome. Welcome. Well, this is my house. Monir. Don't you want to see your home for the summer? It's not my home. How was the trip? Okay. Let's show them. Thank you. Come on. Here is the kitchen. Cups and glasses and plates over here. And here is the stove. Electric, good stove. You can make bread and stuff. Doesn't work. Does this work? Yeah, it works perfectly. Worked for hundreds of years. You just go out in the forest and chop some trees. Run! Monir! Come! ...you can do so freely without you worrying entering someone else's property. The nature is friendly, very friendly, but you need to be careful. It's very big, and you can be-- you can get lost easily. - I'll take this bed. - "I'll take this bed." You always take the bed furthest in. At the refugee camp, on the boat. Remember? I wanted to give you the better bed. Take it. I don't care. Have you seen that all the houses are red? Maybe they don't have any other color. It obviously has to do with which raw material was most easily accessible. You mean in the past, like a hundred years ago? Yes. Maybe fifty years ago. But they still paint with the same color. With blood. They paint with blood. Thanks for the comment, cousin. Tradition. It must have become a tradition. What are you doing? Sleep. You woke me up. It is so quiet that I hear my own thoughts. You must have thoughts to hear them. Sleep! Yusuf has almost stopped smoking since we came here. Well, I smoke less, but there is not much that can stress one here. You mean it's boring? - Exactly. - In that case, I love boring. "Safe" is what they call it here. Don't talk like that in front of her. You should not lie to children. You should not lie to children, but you can lie to adults? What do you mean? You know what I mean. You all know what I mean. Monir, we all know what you mean. But we are not here to change the political situation in the world. We have come to a new country and we must try and look forward if we are going to have a future here. Exactly. "Have a future here." Their weapons kill our brothers and sisters. They live in wealth and we in ruins! Shut up! Listen! Hate only has the power to destroy. Love has the power to create! Read your Quran! Learn! I do not want you at the table if you spread hatred. Fuck Sweden! Run! Where have you been? In the forest. - What's going on? - I thought you had gone! Gone? Gone where? You know, illegal. They will find you! It's pointless! What are you talking about? It's only forest here! Where would I go? It was your idea to come here! It was the right decision to call me. It's for his own protection, even if he doesn't know it. Okay? Okay. Where were you? In the forest. In the forest? I know you were in the forest. - Where did you sleep? - What does it matter? I am here now. Do you know there are bears here? Bears do not scare me. It's people who scare me. Well, you scare me. Hey. Why do you teach them these savage rituals? Because it will help them to adapt to Swedish customs. Why do we need to adapt? Are people not allowed to be who ever they want in this culture? Where is Farid? He went to look at the Swedes' strange rituals. - Where? - Over there. Be careful. Apparently they get very drunk on this particular evening. By the way, I think you should use flowers you pick, not that you buy. What are you doing? Are you mad? - What if they see you? - Let go! They are drunk and angry. We don't want them to see us! I think they look happy. They get angry if they see you! What are they doing? What is this weird ritual? They call it "in the middle of summer." - "In the middle of summer?" - Yes. It is the brightest day of the year. It barely gets dark. Look, do you know what it's supposed to be? Supposed to be? Stop being so weird! Don't you see? Come, come. Look. A dick. Look. Ball, ball, and dick. Clearly it does not represent a dick. Stop messing around! I swear on my mother's innocence. Swear on your own instead. It's true. I'm not messing with you. I also did not believe it when I heard it. Who told you that? He who has the house. Give it here. What is that? Moonshine. Come, let's go back. Come, come. They come here, this fucking trash. They live in there. Think about it. They come here and live here with us. This is our fucking house! Fucking... I didn't really mean to... Monir! Stay here! Hey, fuck. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to break your window. Let go, Farid! Behind! Behind! Let me go! Fucking trash! Go home! Listen. They took the guy into custody. They see it as self-defense because they threw a stone against us. But if the guy chooses to prosecute, it may affect if you get a residence permit. Do you understand? How the hell could you be so damn stupid? - It's nice today, Mom. - Yes, very. I'm going up. Oh, it was cold! Mom, wait a moment. Can I go up first? I really want to get up first. Please. How is Niklas? Will he be visiting? Hello? Sorry, what were you saying? Niklas? Will he be visiting? I have no idea. I think he's at some job or something. - Why do you ask? - Nothing special. I just think he's so charming. And it would be nice to have him here like last summer. What are you doing in the woods all day? The food is ready! Why do you speak like that? Nobody understands what you are saying. The children have to learn. All of you have to learn. The forest heals me. It scares the hell out of me. The forest holds an uncomfortable loneliness. You hold an uncomfortable loneliness. The forest only brings out who you are because its quiet. It's your head talking. So you are wrong. Be careful not to get lost. Wait for me! When are you leaving tomorrow? - Do you have to? - I can't stop it so good. He's fucking jerking off over there! What are you laughing about? I mean... Come on, let's go. Erik! Run! Erik, come here! Run! Run! What has happened? Nothing. I was in the forest. Hello, Monir. Okay, so this is the situation, Monir. I have talked to the man that you assaulted during Midsummer Eve. He had made a police report on abuse. But during the circumstances that a stone was thrown by the same man, maybe the case can be dismissible. But it will be noted in your application for residence permit. Understand? Laila. Laila. Look at me, Monir. But it doesn't change what you have done. And you have to understand that you can not behave like this anymore. Okay? So, I will let you know if anything else happens when anything happens. Good-bye, Yusuf. I feel bad about what happened... ...and I have something to tell you. A confession to make. Don't be afraid. It's okay, I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to talk to you. My name is Moa. What's your name? Monir. Moa and Monir. Come, sit with me please. Why don't you look at me? It's okay, you can just listen while-- I just need to tell you something, so you don't have to speak. Is that okay? Okay. Good. Do you remember the first day that you arrived here? I was there. I saw you. There are those refugees. I think it's unpleasant that they are going to stay out here in the woods. Who knows what they been up to? Mom, be happy that someone is lending their cabin to them. I know who it is. That bohemian Calle or whatever he's called. And the second time I saw you was on Midsummer's Eve and you were hiding behind the shed like you thought that no one could see you, but everyone knew you where there. I mean think about it. Why hide up there when... What are you talking about? About those immigrants who live in Calle's cabin. Where? They're over there hiding behind the shed. Don't look at them. Why don't you invite them over? What if they're terrorists with bombs and blow us all up? That would have been a nice firework. Word. Then I'm going to go and get them. You do that. We thought you were all crazy dancing around that... - What? - No, it's just my cousin. ...he just said stupid things about that cross you were dancing around. Did he say it resembled a dick? Yes. Is it true? I'm afraid so. It's-- it's from the Viking age. They thought that the dicks were a symbol of life. Why did you come here? After what I did, I mean-- Well, that's what I've been trying to tell you. I was-- I was swimming with my mother and I heard something in the woods. I recognized you and I found you... strange, but interesting. I mean, I knew you were following us. I thought that if you knew where I live, then I might as well do the same. I'm going out for a while. I was just so fascinated, you know, by how it must be for you to experience all these things that we, and me, take for granted. And we don't even reflect about it. I mean, have you-- have you even seen forests like this before? I have never seen like this forest. At first, they scared me. But now I love them. Let me show you something. - Now? - Yes. Why not? No, I was-- thought were taking a morning swim. That's why I came here to begin with. No. No? Have you at least tried? I don't like this water. It reminds me of oil. It's okay. I can swim for both of us. You just turn around and keep your hands where I can see them, okay? Are you sure you don't want to try? - I'm sure. - Okay, then help me up. Are you okay? Monir! - What's wrong with you? - Sorry, I didn't-- Did you do it on fucking purpose? - I didn't know! - You don't know him! Stop! Stop, wait! Stop! I told you to let go of me! I don't understand why you're always bugging me! I'm an adult, not a child! You didn't seem like one just now when you cried for mama! How did you find me? That woman from the migration office showed me on the map what lake it was. I thought you'd probably gone there. Did you have sex? What are you talking about? How do you have sex when you're drowning? You're doing weird shit all the time, like masturbating behind trees! Who are you? I don't recognize you! So what? It worked. She wanted to see me again. Yeah, right. It has to mean that she is disturbed in her head. I see no other explanation. You want to fight again? Okay, come on. See! I have done nothing, and you fall. - I have not even touched you. - How silly can one look? Come on, behave yourself. I'm going to the city tomorrow. I have to work extra. I thought you might want to come? No, I'll stay here. I can't stand the city right now. Alone? And what about Niklas? Can you please stop asking about my private life. I don't want to talk about Niklas right now. Can you respect that? I only care about you, okay? But you do what you want. You always have. Monir is a grown man. He can make his own decisions. He keeps saying so, but you don't know what he has gone through. I promised to take care of him. He has no one else. He has found someone now. Who? The girl he meets in the woods. He masturbated behind a tree. That's all their relationship is based on. If mine and Yusuf's relationship at least had been built on that-- I hear. I'm not deaf yet. He is in love. It glows around him. Let him live. Life is now. No one knows what's going to happen tomorrow. He is a good man. Trust him. Maybe you're right. And what about you? And when are you going to start living yourself? Well, when we get a residence permit, then I'll start living. For now, I'm going to stop him from making any more mistakes. What does it mean? It means do you have a cigarette? "Do you have a cigarette?" Bravo. You have to learn now. "You have to learn now." You are not the most ambitious, either. No, but you have to be now, so you can talk to the girl. So you get to have sex. Don't talk about her like that. Oh, how scared I am. Look at the trees. They are very beautiful. It really is. Good-bye, darling. - Good-bye. - Bye. I'll be back as soon as I can. And please don't walk around in the forest by yourself, okay? Good luck at work, mama. Call if you need something. Let's take a ride. Why do we hurry so much through life when it's moments like this that are worth remembering? Maybe because someone else wants us to hurry for them so they can spend their days remembering moments like this. I like that. That wall is beautiful. I love it. Have you ever jumped from it? No. You think it's possible? I don't know. I don't know if you could do it, because then you would have to swim across the water to get back. But whenever you're ready, you just let me know, and we'll jump. That's right. Sometimes you'll have to make the jump and fall-- In love? I'm sorry. That was a bit corny. Look. There are so many stars and galaxies in the universe that they should fill the whole sky with light. Every single part, make the sky white at night. Not dark. Do you know why? Because the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light. And it's not the galaxies that are moving that fast. It's space and time that is expanding between them. Eventually there will be no stars in the sky. - Do you believe that? - I don't know, but what I know is that they just figured this out. Imagine. Imagine that humankind just figured out... something basic like-- like that, why the sky is dark at night. We have been called for a meeting. - What? - With the migration board. They will announce their decision. Here, read. Here's my house. Feel like home, Monir, if you hear a car coming, you just run out the back door and hide in the forest. And hide in the forest? Wow. That's quite a welcoming phrase. I'm sorry, it's just my mother. I don't know how to put it, but she's... Racist. She's a racist. Monir, she's not a racist. She's just afraid of things she doesn't understand. That is the definition of being racist. No, she's ignorant maybe, but she's not a racist. Same things. Racist. Monir, you can't keep on calling my mother a racist. Okay, then introduce me. No, I can't. Not yet. You see? Until you can, your mother is a racist. You have to give her some time. She's a really nice woman once you get to know her. "She's a really nice woman." - So was Eva Braun. - Fuck you! I'm sorry. I was out of line, okay? No, it's not okay! You called my mother a Nazi. - You don't even know her! - Okay, wait! Sorry! You are the one who wants me to run in to the woods if she by any chance would come here! What do you think that makes me feel? I can tell you! Kind of reminds me of not being welcome in this country! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I'm sorry, but-- I don't even know if they will let me stay or not! I'm sorry, I-- I just called your mother Eva Braun. Really? Now it's funny? I'm sorry, it's-- I was just thinking, if she knew that you were in the house with me-- sorry. I'm sorry. Monir, you have to tell me your story first, so I can understand it, okay? I was outside in the sun. I cannot remember what I was doing there. My parents were in the house. I think my mother was calling me for dinner. I remember someone was shouting. First... ...I thought it was my mother. But then I realized it was someone else. And then it came, that sound. Buzzing sound. Like a huge bee. First, I didn't notice. It was not to loud. But then it came closer and closer. I will never forget that sound. And then that voice telling me, "Run! Run!" And I run. And I run. I was running like-- like a wind. Suddenly, I can fly. I can fly. I was thinking... ...the angels are lifting me to the heavens. But then... ...I fell down in the ground again. Everyone was in the house... ...except me. Except me. Monir, don't forget the meeting with the migration board. - Meeting? When? - Tomorrow morning. - You know what's going to happen-- - I have not forgotten. - You know what happens if you don't show up. - What happens? Don't worry, Farid. I'll get him home in time. Okay. I really like Farid. I will tell him. He will be happy. Not many people do. Well, he really cares about you. He loves you. - You know that? - I know. But it's just sometimes he can be so overprotective, you know? Yeah, I know exactly what you-- I think my mom is home. Is it okay if you just wait here and I go and check? Why? I want to meet her. - You met Farid. - Please, Monir? Hi! There you are! - Where have you been? - What are you doing here? I asked him to come. He came by in the city to leave some things and... He was going to return the things I forgot at his place. Sorry, I don't want to intrude. I understand if you need your space. Niklas, can you please come? Close the door behind you. Niklas, you can't just show up here without notice. Do you remember last time we spoke? - Yes. - And what did I say? That you wanted time to think and be alone over the summer. So why are you here? The summer is soon over and I haven't heard from you. I haven't received a Snap, an SMS, nothing. I have been missing you. Stop it! What are you doing? Hello? Hi, who are you? - What are you doing here? - My name is Monir. I'm with Moa. Hi. Nice to meet you. Hello. - Moa! - Hi. Moa! - What are you doing here? - Who is this? Why are you kissing this guy? - I'm not kissing this guy. - I'm her boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. What are you talking about? - Have you lied to me? - He's not my boyfriend, Monir. - Have you lied to me? - Niklas, can you please leave a moment? - No, I'm not going to leave. - Can you just leave? Hi, my name is Karin Frossmark. A refugee has forced himself in... What is she doing? I haven't done anything! - Mom! - A refugee? Seriously? - Mom! - So you've been fucking all summer with a dirty fucking refugee? Yes, I have and he's fucking good at it, too. Stay away from her! Now they are starting to fight! - Monir, what are you doing? - I'm protecting you! You're not protecting me. You're scaring me! I was right. You are ashamed of me. You are ashamed of me. You cannot admit it, least of all to yourself. But you're ashamed of me. You're like the others. Afraid. What's going on? Nothing. You're lying. I'm not stupid. Have you been in a fight with someone? Answer me, Monir. Stay here. Tell me what's going on! You are not my guardian. I'm not a child. Wake up! Tomorrow is the meeting! "Wake up. Tomorrow is the meeting." I don't give a shit! They will throw you out idiot! Let them throw me out. I don't even want to be here. You want to be here! All you do is for yourself! You are selfish, selfish! You are a child! You do not know what's best for you! I promised your father I'd take care of you! And you'll do what I say without discussion! Who do you think you are? You mean nothing to me. You are nothing to me. Nothing. And my father never liked you. And he never asked for your help. Okay. You are free. Fuck it all! Fuck your life, your future, everything! Do what you want! I've taken you here, but you're a dog! An asshole! An idiot! Get out of my sight! - Hey, have you heard from him? - Nothing. I have called him for an hour, and no answer either. Nothing! What are we going to do? I have to go and look for him. Monir! Monir! Monir! Monir! Monir! Monir! Monir! Hey! Hello? Police. Can you come over here please? - Do you live in here? - Yes. Can we go inside and talk? Can we just go inside for moment? What took you so long? We are border police. We are here on another matter. But he hit me and threatened us. Do you want to press charges? - Do you want to press charges? - No. Could you do me a favor? Can you two leave for two minutes? Moa, you stay here. Moa, this is the case. Monir didn't show up for his meeting with the migration board. His application for residence permit has been rejected. You know him, don't you, Moa? - Yes, you do. - You know where he is. We know that he's not in his home, Moa. Moa, help us to help him. Come on. Okay. Monir. Can I come in? What are you doing here? I thought you'd be here. Please? Why are you here? You know why I'm here. No, why? Because I love you, that's why. And that other-- - Good? - I love you. You're a crazy Swedish woman. Okay, Monir, listen. Whatever happens, I will always love you, okay? Police! - How did they-- - Monir. You have to give yourself up. Police! You told them! Answer me! - Don't touch me! - If you come now, nothing bad will happen, Monir. If you stay, you still have a chance! Chance? How do I have a chance? How did I ever have a chance? They bullshitted you. I have no chance. I have no chance. Police! Police! Don't move. Police! Don't move! Stay-- stay where you are! No! Stay! Drop the knife! Drop the knife and stay where you are! - Drop the knife! - Monir! Drop the knife! Drop the knife! Run! Don't stop! Run! Come, come, come. Drop your knife! Farid! Farid! Farid! Farid! Farid! Farid, Farid, Farid, Farid! Farid! Calm down. Farid! Farid! Farid! Farid! Calm down! Calm down. Calm down. Watch your head and get into the car. Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop! No! Let me go! Monir! No! I just want to say good-bye! - Calm down! - I promised! - I just want to say good-bye! - Easy, easy, easy! - Let me go! - Calm down, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Run! Run! Run! No! No. No. - Come. - I want to fly. Do you want to fly? Let's fly. - Do you like this place? - Yes! Your father loved this place.
