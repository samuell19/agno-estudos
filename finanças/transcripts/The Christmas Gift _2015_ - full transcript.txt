** * Ooh * Can you feel it in the air * * This Christmas * It's the holiday spirit all around the world * * There is magic in our hearts * * Joy and forgiveness * A sense of wonder in the eyes of every boy and girl * * It's the season of peace and love * * All around the world * Sure as the stars above * It feels like Christmas * Ooh That's better. - Hey. - Hey, Mom. I brought you some candy and boxes. What you got? Let me see. Oh. "When winter's snow is on the ground and colored lights are all around, I hope this gift will help you write about what made your Christmas bright. Signed, Wesley Hardin Johnson." Aw. Well, that's very nice, Wesley. But you know a Secret Santa's not supposed to sign their name. I'll never meet the person who gets this, so what's the difference? Okay. I guess you got a point there. [Mom chuckles] Hey. Your father and I are very proud of you. How come? Well, because all of this was your own idea, and it's a darn good one. What you're doing here is gonna make some child you don't even know so much happier on Christmas morning. And that, my friend, is a good thing. - Thanks, Mom. - Oh. Baby. Who's it from? It's from your Secret Santa. [laughs] Aunt Helen, why would somebody I don't even know send me a present? Oh, he's a boy your own age, who just wants to share Christmas with other kids. It's, like, his hobby. I bet if I ever met him we would become friends forever. [laughs] I'm sure you would, honey. "When winter's snow is on the ground and colored lights are all around, I hope this gift will help you write about what made your Christmas bright. Wesley Hardin Johnson." - Do you like it, honey? - I love it. [Aunt Helen laughs] No. No. "Five gluten-free cocktail recipes for your holiday party." Oh. "Shape your eyebrows to a higher salary." I can write that. I can't... write that. [knocking] Hey! Uh, you got a second? I'm usually the one asking you that. - What's up? - Okay. So you know I like you right? After six months together, I would think would be the case. [chuckles] Yeah, so anyway, um-- Look, I've just been so incredibly busy with everything that's going on around here that I feel like I haven't been able to devote the kind of time and attention you deserve from me. It's me, not you. It's totally me. Cooper. He really has me under the gun here right now. Are you trying to get out of our dinner date tonight? Because if you are, I'm gonna kill you. Trying to get out of dinner? No, no. Well, I mean yes. Maybe. Alex, what is going on with you? Look, I've just been thinking. You know, we're really two different types of people. Strike that. We're two very similar types of people. We both want the same thing-- to be the top dog around here. - What's wrong with that? - Megan... i don't want a girlfriend who wants to be me. You know? I'm not into the whole competition thing. Just causes stress that I don't need right now. Wait. Are you trying to break up with me right here at work? Well, I didn't want to take you out tonight and just ruin your evening. I can't believe you. Look, it'll be good for both of us, just take a little time off. See what we really want, especially with the holidays and everything. You are pathetic and immature. Thanks for understanding. I-- I am on my way to the top. Who am I kidding? - Hey! - Hey. Why aren't you at the Christmas party? I'm sorry. I was so busy getting dumped that it slipped my mind. Oh, no. Alex? [sighs] I'm sorry. Don't be. Apparently he feels like I'm competing with him, that I want to "be him." Uh, who would want to be him? Besides, you're better than he is. That's what he's really worried about. I mean-- [exhales] Best to find out now, I guess, but... at Christmastime? [scoffs] He's a piece of work, I'll give you that. Well, I will show him who the top dog is. Girl, show him later. We have a party to get to. Come on. Oh, okay. [chattering] Merry Christmas. ALL: Merry Christmas. Now get back to work. [laughing] Alrighty. It's that joyous time of year again, right, folks? Christmas. Big ad sales, whole lotta people expectin' a whole lotta stuff from us. All right? So, that's why I have a few assignments we're gonna have to get right back on when we get done here. Real top-notch stuff. Ah. Nice of you to join. As we all know, our publication is about community, right? Our audience, they look to us to keep up with the things that matter most to them, especially in the immediate world around us. That's who we are. That's who we'll always be. Now, some of you have really excelled this year. Right to the top. You know who you are. All right, our top story going forward will be the plight of those people dispossessed at Christmastime this year by the corporate takeover and renovation of the Gladstone area. All right, city beautification. But at what cost? Real human interest stuff, people, right? Coupled with a dose of moral outrage should get us some big things. We might be able to make a difference. This is important. That's why I'm giving this assignment... - to Alex. - [gasps] MAN: Whoo! - Whoo! - Whoo! Thank you, sir. I won't let you down. After the outstanding coverage of the reservoir pollution scandal last month, I expect nothing less. I wrote that. Drink up. Please, sit down. You took off so fast, I didn't get a chance to talk to you. I had some things I needed to finish. So I see. Can I help you? Look, I know you wanted that assignment. And I'm sorry. Wow. Everybody's sorry today. Megan, that story I gave Alex... has an unhappy ending. Needs someone with a little more bite than you have. What are you saying? You're too earnest. Yeah. You're not prepared to cut into something with a dull knife, and that's what this story needs. You're not like Alex. [chuckles] Funny you should say that. Look, there're a lot of people out there, okay, Megan? Some of them want to read about people getting kicked out of their homes, but there are others who wanna feel good about something-- about anything-- especially at Christmas. And that matters. Maybe. But I deserve more. I want to make my mark. I want to mean something, and you're holding me back. Am I holding you back? Really? No. Tell you what. Get me something really cool and inspiring. Wow me. Destroy the box. - "Destroy the box"? - Right. Don't just think outside the box, destroy the box. Destroy the box. Right. Now we're cooking. * I'm flying high in the Christmas sky * * Headed home to you * Then the winter wind and the storm rolls in * * To turn this holiday blue * But I'll make my way like Santa's sleigh * * Baby, there ain't no doubt AUNT HELEN: Found this with some of your old things today and thought you might wanna have it. Please think about coming over when you can. I know you're busy, but I miss you. Aunt Helen. Wow. I had forgotten all about you. "When winter's snow is on the ground and colored lights are all around, I hope this gift will help you write about what made you're Christmas bright. Wesley Hardin Johnson." If he only knew. Wait. What am I talking about? [exhales] This is perfect. Ah! It's perfect. "Wesley Hardin Johnson." Yes! [typing] - Hi. - Hello. Can I help you? Yes, I'm here to see Mr. Johnson. Do you have an appointment? No, but I will only take a moment of his time. I'm sorry. No one sees Mr. Johnson without an appointment. It's kind of important. What's this about? Uh-- "Megan Phillips? Nightlife Style magazine? That's right [chuckles] I love your work! Oh. "How To Choose the Right Lip Gloss to Get a Proposal this Christmas." Yeah, that's me. So what do you say? Well, let's just see what I can do. Great. Yes? Your, uh, 11:30 is here. I don't have an 11:30. Yes, you do. Remember? I told you this morning. Send him in. - Go right in. - Thank you. Just one more thing. Does it really work? The lip gloss. Oh. You'll just have to try it for yourself. Mr. Johnson? - Miss? - Um-- Phillips. I'm-- [laughs] I'm sorry, I don't, um-- What are we meeting about? I think I've made a mistake. Mistake? You're just a lot older than I expected. You're very quick with the, uh, compliments. Oh, um, no. I'm-I'm so sorry. I-I didn't mean it like that. Um, I just-- The Wesley Johnson I'm-I'm looking for is about 30 years old. You're thinking of Wes Junior, my son. You have a son named Wesley who's about my age? Does he work here? O-Okay. Um-- Do you know where I could find him? - [paper rustling] - [sighs] The Meadow Glen Children's Center. Great. Thank you. Uh, does he volunteer there? He runs the joint. What do want my son for, Miss Phillips? Oh, um, he's-- He's involved in a project I'm working on. I mean, that is, if I can find him. Project. When he could've been part of this. What is it? It's a very new, exciting project that I'm working on. Um, okay, well, thank you so much for your time. If you'll excuse me. - Miss Phillips. - Hmm? When you see my son, tell him his father says... hello. I'll do that. Oh, excuse me. I'm looking for Wesley Johnson. His office is right through that door. Thanks. [door creaks] [zing] [chuckles] Mr. Johnson? Today only. [laughs] Please, come in. Have a seat. Thank you. Nice, uh, rod. Oh, thanks. I just got it. What can I do for you? Megan Phillips. Oh, you're a writer. You interested in doing a human interest story? 'Cause the center could really use one right about now. My thoughts exactly. Good. I don't want it to be about me, though. The kids are what really matter here. - Yes, of course, the kids. - [knocking] Sorry, Wes, but we need you. Now? Now. Uh, would you excuse me for a moment? Sure. I'll be right back. All right, kids, let's get a snack. What seems to be the problem, Officer? Just a little understanding concerning an unpaid item. I see. Look, it's not the end of the world. The store does have its policies. During the holidays, this sort of thing just gets out of hand. I don't think he's a bad kid. What is it he forgot to pay for? Snow globe. One of our best. Why? It was for you. For Christmas. [sighs] What can we do about this? Mr. Reynolds is willing to let this whole thing go. Especially under these circumstances. As long as you pay for the globe. Oh. How much to make it better? Twenty dollars. - Here's 40 for your trouble. - Oh, no, twenty's fine. Um, here's the globe, you paid for it. And, uh, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I know you were just trying to do something nice for me, but I can't accept this. You understand? I just can't. Now go to your room and think about what you've done. I'm sorry. I know you are. Now take off. [sighs] Please don't write about this. What kind of girl do you think I am? The kind that likes to write? COOPER: So I'm impressed. I didn't think you'd come up with anything. And then you figured I would give up and go back to what I do best? Something like that. So what happens next? Well, I'm having dinner with my subject tonight, and if I play my cards right, I think I can get enough material for a feature piece. Good for you. Don't blow it. I'm saving you an open space in tomorrow's edition. I need it first thing in the morning. Uh, yes, of course. thank you. Here are those archival clippings of last year's tree lighting ceremony that you asked for. Good job, Nina. I'll get these back to you when I'm done. Remember what I said. - What's going on? - Uh, nothing. I just had to sell Cooper on a story idea that I had. Bravo. What's It about? Well, I told him it's about the foster children's center and how hard it is to find the kids homes during the holidays, and that's what it's going to be about, sort of. Did you see this? Um-- [chuckles] This was given to me 20 years ago, by some kid playing Secret Santa-- a kid I had never met before. It's what made me want to become a writer. [chuckles] Just this simple little notebook. Cool. Yeah. Yeah, it recently found its way back to me, and I used the poem that he wrote in the inside to track him down. That's awesome. Meeting after 20 years. - What did he say? - Oh. Uh, he doesn't know about this yet. I just-- I heard that he ever sent me, you know, gifts all that long ago. I just, um-- I didn't tell him. Uh, why not? Well, he said he doesn't want the story to be about him, and I certainly don't want it to be about me. So you're not going to tell him. I'm going to tell him. Sometime, maybe. You know, when it benefits me. Megan, you are not to be trusted. country] Good evening. Wow. That is a very pretty dress. Thank you. You know, I've never been here before. Best pepperoni slice in town. Just make sure the pizza stays on your plate. Of course. Thank you. I do appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. I know today's been quite hectic for you. That sort of thing happens all the time. Foster kids have a whole set of problems that are unique to them. I can imagine. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I would really like to hear about them and you. Um-- [chuckles] I mean, that's why were here, right? Great. Great. Um-- I just-- [Megan laughs] I just didn't want to seem over-eager. No. But like I said, it can't be about me. Of course. But I want to learn about everything, so people get the complete picture of what the center is all about. I get you. How did you ever come to head up a center for foster children? I mean, that seems like it would be very demanding. Yeah, it can be. But that's what I like about it. Even since I was a little kid, I used to spend all my free time helping others. I'd create these boxes, which I used to call Christmas care packages. Just a little box full of simple gifts that I would donate to an outreach program that would find good homes for 'em. And it was fun to do. But you never had any idea who received your Christmas care packages? No. No, that was part of the fun, trying to imagine what kind of kid would receive the box. I would do all of it myself. Otherwise, what would be the point? And now you've devoted yourself to a foster kids program when you could've been the VP of the largest architectural firm in the state. And how do you know that? I'm a reporter. It's my job to know. And as she steps forward to accept her Nobel Prize for outstanding journalistic achievement, she types humbly, "byline... Megan Phillips." [chuckles] Wesley Johnson, you may not know it, but you've just given this girl the second best Christmas gift she has ever received. [typing] Welcome to my world. Love the way you've woven Wesley's inner determination to leverage his family fortune. It's his desire to actually help people, even at the expense of his own pocketbook. The true story of a person that gives till it hurts, instead of receiving at the holidays. I'm glad you like it. Yeah. This goes to the website in 30 minutes. Print version will hit tomorrow morning. Okay? Congratulations. Well done. Now how do you plan to top it? Um, we hit it again? Make it a series? We do still have one more issue to put out before Christmas Eve. How to do you plan to go about that? We focus on the children. Find out who they are and how they relate to Wesley and figure out why they have nowhere to go for the holidays. We can find our own little Tiny Tim. [chuckles] Hook our readers into his story. Pull them in. Tiny Tim. I like Tiny Tim, I like it a lot. It's a real Charles Dickens angle. Nice. Now get back to work. Megan! Hey. Oh. What, you've come to thank me for ghostwriting your reservoir piece? Hey, that's what girlfriends do. But seriously, about that? I told editorial I'd share my byline with you. - They totally screwed it up. - Really? Of course. Anyway, I read your story about that Wesley Johnson guy. You know, he's the son of that huge architect. That's right. Well, I found your piece very interesting. Wealthy big shot father, charitable selfless son. Oil and water-- two completely different types of people. Got me thinking a lot. About us. - Oh, please. - No. Please let me finish. Maybe I was a little hasty with the whole you-and-me business. Why don't we go out tonight and hash things over? I feel like I owe you one anyway for the reservoir piece. Oh, my gosh. That is so gracious, but I think I'm gonna have to pass. Don't you have work to do? [sighs] Yes. So, uh, can we continue this conversation later over dinner? Maybe. ** [Muzak] Hi, Aunt Helen. Megan! What a surprise. Well, Merry Christmas, and I brought you a little something. Oh. Ooh. [laughing] Thank you. [chuckles] Merry Christmas to you too. Thank you. How are you? I've been all right. Just slowing down some. Aunt Helen, you've been saying that for years now. Well, it's true, you know. Even my slow is getting slow now. It's so nice to see you. I thought maybe I wouldn't see you before Christmas. I know. I'm sorry. I've been so busy at work, and I keep trying to get ahead, which apparently, in my case, is difficult. Well, that will change... and soon. No, I feel it in my bones. - That's just arthritis. - [laughs] Oh, you! A few days ago, you sent me my old leather notebook. I did. They're making us clean out all our stuff from the storage room. Clear out? Why? I don't know, but something's going on. I just don't know what yet. Yeah. Aunt Helen, you don't happen to have any of the other gifts still that the boy sent me along with the notebook, do you? Oh. No, I don't think so, honey. That notebook was the only one that you really hung on to as you grew up. The other gifts just fell by the wayside. Well, thanks anyway. Um-- I think I'm just gonna go pay your rent and figure out what's happening with the storage situation. Thank you, sweetie. I love you. I love you too, dear. - Hi. - Oh. Can I help you, Miss Phillips? Oh, yes. I just came to pay my aunt's rent and to find out what's happening with her storage space. Is there something going on I should know about? I'm afraid there is. We just got the final word this morning. What happened? New construction. Yes, the whole community is about to be "revitalized." Converted to upscale luxury condos. What? They can't do that. Oh, they can, and they are. But if you can come up with some clever ideas, just let me know because I'm being laid off. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, my eye. Bah humbug! Wesley. Hey. Just couldn't stay away, huh? Did you see my article? I did. It was great. - Great job. - Oh, you're too kind. Better yet, it paid off. How's that? Well, this morning... we got a donation. A big one. Wow! $5,000. Yeah. Your article reached out and touched someone. Apparently. Well, the print edition hits newsstands tomorrow, so hopefully there's more where that came from. We can only hope. I know your magazine changes out every week, but anything's better than nothing. Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I think we should do a follow-up for the big Christmas issue. What more is there to say? Can we speak privately somewhere? Okay. They look so intense. What are they doing over there? They're making Christmas cards, which can be kind of challenging for little hands. We distribute them to others who struggle around this time of year. You know, that's exactly the angle I'm looking for. A follow-up piece focusing on you and your work with the children. Oh. What were you thinking? I think we can work together to help find them families that'll get them out of here for Christmas. Couldn't hurt. We found holiday homes for most of our kids, but I haven't had any luck with these last six. - They're not as easy to place. - Why is that? You've seen Chase. His mother died when he was young. His father was in the military, killed in Afghanistan. He lived with his relatives for a while, but there were some behavioral issues. And, well-- I guess I was lucky. I had one person who didn't give up on me, but I still felt like I had nothing. [sighs] Now I know what nothing looks like. He'll be okay. He's a survivor. Now, Shelly, she lived in a home where everyone screamed and yelled at each other all the time, and now she only talks in a whisper. Wow. That's so sad. Maybe I can help. Maybe. I don't want these kids exploited for just a few cheap click-throughs on your website. Wesley, what kind of girl do you think I am? Well, join us tonight, and I'll let you know. Cooper's gone all out over your story, but I think if you'd stuck to the notebook idea, it would've been better. It didn't really come up, but it worked out anyway, right? No kidding. Cooper's ordered twice the normal print run of this week's edition. Let me see. [snickers] Read it and weep, Alex. What are you working on? Oh, just checking some facts regarding tenant's rights. - Why? - They're planning to convert the retirement community that my aunt lives in to luxury condos and-- Well, I have to find her a new place to live. I can barely afford the one she's in now. Oh, that sucks. Yeah. I was trying to find maybe a small hiccup in the system that could possibly delay the process. [clears throat] Ladies. What now? I couldn't help hearing you mention that upscale community that's starting up in East Town. What about it? Well, it just so happens to be the focus of my new lead story. What? Why? The company behind it all happens to be owned by one Wesley Johnson Sr. Are you kidding me? This is where you and I can really share a byline together. Excuse me? Don't you see? My story, your story. They're glued together now. We could join forces and knock it outta the park. Father versus son. Profit versus charity. It's irony. Sweet irony. I'd say it was a lucky break. How long have you known about this? Since I read her article this morning. [scoffs] What are the chances? [chuckles] Hey there. Hey! What brings you back here so soon? Hot off the presses. It's not even available until tomorrow. Oh, this so cool. I wanted be the first to give a copy to Mr. Johnson. He's not in his office today. Oh. He's in the library. End of the hall. Thanks. I owe you one. Uh, Mr. Johnson. Funny running into you here. Especially considering this is my library. And a grand one at that. I just wanted to thank you for steering me in the right direction. - Oh? - Yes. Um, I'm a writer for Nightlife Style magazine, and, um, it's tomorrow's edition. [laughs] You're a fast worker, huh? I have to be. It's Christmas. And I wanted you to have a copy before anybody else. And you brought it all the way down here just for me. Well, there is one other thing. Yes? Your company is planning the new upgraded condos at Sunset Villas, right? And? Does it have to be the Sunset Villas? That area has come to a complete standstill. It needs to be revitalized. It's best for everyone. No. It's not best for my aunt. She lives there. Well, in order for something new to go up, something old has to come down. And there's absolutely nothing else you can renovate? The property acquisition has already been made, Miss Phillips. i just can't... everything away. Not that I want to. But thank you for the magazine. It's nice to know that my son is not completely throwing his life away. * Oh, St. Nick's got a new bag of tricks * * He's landing on rooftops all over town * You guys ready to have fun today? Yes! Hey, guys. Hey. Nice hat. It was an offer I couldn't refuse. [laughs] So what can I help out with? Uh, help with some shoes? I'm on it. Ready? [whispering] Oh. [whispering] Sharing secrets already? Just between us girls. What'd she say? That she has a crush on you. And what did you say? A girl's gotta keep some stuff to herself. All right. [laughs] The kids love this place. Alley gives us a special deal, and it's great exercise. Hmm. Are they any good? [yelling] Absolutely not, But don't tell them that. Yeah! [chattering] Yeah! [laughing] [Megan laughing] [clears throat] Did, um, you minor in dance in college? What kind of question is that? Are you making fun of me? No. No, no. You just have a certain... flair. That's what you call it? - Your turn. - 'Kay. Beginner's luck. [laughs] Let me help you. ** [tender] [laughs] Whoa! - Wow. That's better, huh? - Yeah, it is! So I keep coming back to how you ended up at Meadow Glen. I mean, you have a degree from Stanford. You have all kinds of doors open for you. How do you say no to all that money and success after working so hard? Well, it depends on how you value money and how you define success. Fair enough. Then what is the most rewarding part of your job? When one of these kids doesn't come back. What do you mean? I mean when they-- When they find their forever home. It is tough not being able to see them every day, but it's the best thing that could happen to them. I would like to argue that... you're probably the best thing to ever happen to them. You working up an angle for your next article? I mean, don't you want more? I-I certainly do. Well, of course I want more. It's just not the more that you're probably thinking of. Not the kind, I guess, you want. When you never have anything, you grow up wanting everything. I'm sorry it had to be like that. No, it's okay. Listen, I am still climbing my way to the top, one word at a time. [laughs] Oh, wow. Outstanding, buddy! It's gonna be a hard score to beat. Whoo! They're not bad. [laughs] So... what about the second article? I think it would really help the kids. I think it would really help you. What I don't want is for these kids to become rungs on your ladder to success. They've been through enough already. I understand that. I-- I promise you, you won't regret it. I'll think about it. Can you think about it quickly? [laughing] Like now? Oh, man. [laughs] [rhythmic knocking] Coming. Hello! [both laughing] [Megan sighing] Oh, no, you don't. I'm working. Oh, yes, I do. Nothing sparks a girl's creativity like a 2002 Cabernet. Did you say 2002? Mm-hmm. So, you've been hard to reach these last 24 hours. I know. There's a lot going on. So I hear. Well, Cooper liked my first piece so much, he's letting me do a follow-up. Ah, so you finally told Wesley about your notebook. Oh, uh, no. No, not exactly. So you lied to him. I didn't lie about anything, I just didn't tell him the whole truth. There's a difference. My father used to call that a lie by omission. I-- I think we're past that point anyway. - It would just be awkward. - Whatever you say. You seem to be insinuating that I'm taking advantage of him. Mmm. Not me. I would never suggest such a thing. Besides, it is your job to pull a story out of him however you do it. Exactly. And he did agree to a second article. Well, see, there you go. There's one condition. I have to volunteer at the center. - That's great! - Mm-mm. It is not great. What am I gonna do with all of those kids? Give back a little. It'll be healthy for you to see how the other half lives. Oh, I have seen it. I have lived it, and I hated it. I think he's literally trying to make me work for my article. Hmm. I think he's trying to spend more time with you. And last I checked, you were single. Oh. [scoffs] If you didn't have wine, I would kill you. Girl, if I didn't have wine, I'd kill myself. [both laughing] [typing] Working on your next masterpiece? [sighs] Jealous? Me, jealous? Well, yeah, sorta. I'll give you this, you did do it on your own. And it's good. Say it. You're right. It's good. But it could be better if you just let me help you. I'm not teaming up with you, byline or no byline. Okay. All right. At least hear me out though? No. I've thought about it, and that's, um, that's not the kind of article I'm interested in. Really? You're sticking with this whole feel-good angle? Yeah, and it's been working for me. Listen, I just don't understand how slamming Mr. Johnson's plans is gonna help anything. Megan, that's where you're wrong, It's a story of two different worlds. It literally writes itself. And... And? And... we could be a team again. I wouldn't do it without you. That's comforting. Please, just think about it. It would be the biggest piece this rag has ever seen. It could help both of us. A lot. But it would hurt Wesley. [sighs] Why do you even care? When this is finished, you'll never see this guy again. But something like this will take your little puff piece to a whole other level, a level I know you wanna be at. Right alongside me. Right along with me. Don't start. I'm not your girlfriend. Whatever you say. MEGAN: "'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a louse." Mouse! A mouse. Oh, okay, right. Don't know how I missed that. "Not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with hair." Care! Oh, right. She's a natural. Too bad she's not around more often. Oh? [laughing] "He was chubby and--" She could make your life a little easier. That's what you're here for. You know what I mean. "A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread." Oh, so you think she's the one? MEGAN: "And filled all the stockings--" You have to get past the hurt sometime. I will. When I'm ready. "Up the chimney he rose. But I heard him explain, ere he drove out of sight." You're ready. "Happy Christmas to all and have a nice flight." [laughing] Okay, kids, say thank you to Miss Phillips. Thank you, Miss Phillips. You're welcome. Now everyone to your room for an hour of quiet time. Let's go. [clicks tongue] I honestly didn't think you'd show up today. Oh, well, reporting as ordered, sir. Well, I've reconsidered that. I just wanted to see what kind of girl you really were, and now that I have, you don't have to come by. - But I want to. - Why? You must be really busy writing up all my adventures. Don't you have a deadline? I do, but I'm not too busy for you. And the kids. You and the kids. [laughs] Well, the children love you too, so you are very welcome to stick around. I went to see your father again yesterday. I asked him not to convert the Sunset Villas into condos. I'm sorry. I didn't realize he was involved with that. Well, he is, and he said-- "That's progress. For something new to go up, something old must come down." - Yeah. - Yeah. That's what he always says. I just feel so terrible for those people. Once you reach a certain age, change is not a welcome thing. Well, we can at least make sure they have a merry Christmas. What do you say we get the kids to whip up a batch of special Christmas cards, and then they hand-deliver them to the folks down there? That's a wonderful idea. I think I have a better one. Why not have the children recreate your original Christmas care packages. I mean, that way they can really experience the act of giving. You're right. We can have them fill up the boxes with fun things. Useful things. Silly things. - Tasty things. - [laughs] This is brilliant. Megan, I could almost kiss you. [gasps] Uh, you need to see me? Yes, sir. Oh. Um-- That's okay. I-I have to, um, go Christmas shopping. You know, for the care packages and all that jazz. - Let's talk later. - Yes. The-- We-- We'll talk later. Okay. What's on your mind, pal? Twenty dollars. That's a lot of money. Where did this come from? Will you accept my gift now? Yes, I will. Just this once. Never again, you understand? Yes, sir. Hey. Thank you. - Got a minute? - Sure. I wanna show you something. This is a Purple Heart. Where'd you get something like this? Chase sold it to me for $20. AUNT HELEN: This is excellent. I read every word of it. And to think that it's that same boy. And I have you to thank for all of this. Oh, no, dear. No, really. If you hadn't sent me that notebook-- I had completely forgotten about it. Well, I kept it ever since you went off to college. There were so many wonderful memories you'd written down in it. You read my entries? Oh-- [stammers] Just a few. [chuckles] Well, I had to make sure it was something you'd really want back. And now look. A wonderful Christmas story you can be proud of. No, I'm proud of you. It should have been writing your story. Oh, poo. There's nothing special about me. When my father abandoned me, you took me in. A single woman, barely able to scrape by, raising someone else's child alone. That's pretty special. I didn't realize until recently what it's like to not even have one person care about you. But I do now. AUNT HELEN: All right. Enough of this mushy stuff. You didn't come all the way over here just to gush on me [laughs] No. I wanted to tell you that the children from the center are gonna come here and deliver their Christmas care packages, just like the one I received 20 years ago. How wonderful! God, so many of these people have no one to visit with at the holidays. You are going to have to move. I don't know where yet, but I promise I will figure it out. That's all right, dear. Everything always works out. I hope so, Aunt Helen. - Busy? - Hah. Never for my son. - How you been? - I'm fine, son, fine. I've been reading a lot about you lately. Yeah, funny how that worked out. Yeah, but I'm not so sure it's all for the best. What does that mean? Well, I've met the writer. Twice. I'm not so sure she's so sincere about helping you're center, or she's out for her own personal gain. Well, either way, what difference does it make? - It's just an article. - Yeah, true. But there's a lot of people who'd like to bring this company down a peg or two, and I just want to establish she's not trying to get to me through you. Oh, so this is about you. Is that it? No. This is about us. This family. Listen. I know it's been... hard on you since your mother passed, and I haven't always been there. But we are still family. I feel your hurt. Dad... engagements have been broken off before, so... don't worry about me. And I think I know what kind of girl Megan is, and I trust her. Is this all you wanted to talk to me about? A check for $10,000. Why? Well, it's long overdue. I've always-- [chuckles] been jealous of you working at that center and not here. I know I shouldn't have, but that, um, article, well, it's-- It's maybe given me a new thought. This will help a lot. I've got about a dozen kids that still need homes. Especially around Christmas. Well, Megan is whipping up a new article. She thinks it's gonna help. Oh, uh, maybe-- [chuckles] Maybe I've misjudged her. Yeah, um, tell you what. Um-- Tonight, at La Rogue. Three of us. - Dinner. - Really? Yeah, all right. I'll ask her. Thanks. Yes, Mr. Johnson? Those papers I was waiting for, they ever come in? Y-Yes, sir. I'll bring them right to you. Okay, remember. Not a word of this to anyone, especially my son. Understood? Understood. ** * Wherever you go I wanna be there * * Sharing these holidays * Now it feels like a hole is here in my heart * * 'Cause I'm watching you walk away * * The carolers are singing What's the matter, Chase? Everybody else is having fun. What's wrong? I wanna go home for Christmas. I wanna go home to my daddy. You can't. I know how you must feel, but this is your family right now. They said my dad was dead, but he's not dead. He'll come back for me. You'll see. I'm so sorry. But some things just can't be helped. Mmm! Oh! Thank you. Oh, my gosh! Thank you. Oh, so sweet! [laughs] Did you see? This is a great idea. Everybody wins. I'm embarrassed to say that it was all Megan's doing. I don't know why I didn't think of it. Christmas care packages were my idea first. I guess maybe your mind was on other things. Like what? Like her. [chattering] No. All right, yeah. Does she know? Nope. - This is the best Christmas. - Love you. ** [melancholy] Thank you. Merry Christmas. Well? Amazing. Just amazing. Kids are really getting into the spirit of giving, and considering their situation, that's almost a miracle. See? Miracles can happen. Oh, thanks to you. I didn't do anything. I just set up a great story. [laughs] Still clawing your way to the top? One word at a time. I wonder what happened to Chase? He's been struggling lately. Can you blame him? Oh, there he is. He looks like he found a new friend. So did I. Me too. Oh, kids! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Let's go. We're gonna-- Everybody, it's time to sing carols. Duty calls. Dinner tonight? With me and my father. I would be honored. * Deck the halls with boughs of holly * * Fa la la la la La la la la * * 'Tis the season to be jolly * * Fa la la la la La la la la * * Don we now our gay apparel * * Fa la la la la la la La la la * * Fa la la la la La la la la * "And the grace of Christmas, the spirit of giving, shall live in the hearts of all good people forever." Done. Hey, partner. I am not your partner. Then why am I always helping you? Because if benefits you in some way? True, true. But I'd feel awful if I didn't mention that the final deadline for getting into today's digital edition is about uh, ten minutes from now. - No. - Yes. I don't have my photos! - What? Where are they? - In graphic design. You better hurry. ** [mischievous] See you at 8:00. Excuse me! Nina? - Where's the fire? - My photos from today. I need then right now. The deadline is a minute away. Here you go. Oh! Bless you. Move! Hey, the deadline's not for another hour. Thank you! MEGAN: Okay. Two minutes. Ah. I got the photos copied... over and the article finished. Better hit send. [yelps, pants] Send. Whew! Barely made it. [chuckles] Jeez. Okay, um, I gotta go. - What's the rush? - I have to get my hair done. - Oh. Date night? - Maybe. With that guy? If you're trying to make me jealous-- We're not talking about this right now. Maybe later. Thank you for helping me. You're welcome. Have fun. Hey, Joe. Alex. Listen. Megan was in such a hurry to get out of here she accidentally hit send on a new piece. Yeah, yeah, go ahead and put a hold on that. I promise you the final piece will be there in 30 minutes. Thanks. All right. Who's your buddy now? WESLEY: Megan, I have something I want to say to you. I'm all ears. Well, when I first met you-- Yes? I was a little gun shy. I didn't really know where you were coming from, and I had a few trust issues. That's understandable. I'm a reporter. Oh. Then you asked me what kind of girl I thought you were. And... - I think you're great. - You do? Well, I feel the same. - Hmm. - About you. Oh, really? Scout's honor. I hope you haven't started this party without me. Mr. Johnson. Please. All my friends call me Lee. Dad, happy you could make it. Oh, don't be silly, Wesley, After all, this was my own idea, and I wanted to... chat with this young lady who's written so much about my son. Hi. Give me a whiskey neat, please. And not a moment too soon. Um, yes. I'm so sorry. Would you, uh, excuse me for a moment? Well? Well, she's, um-- She's very pretty. She's very ambitious. - Dad-- - All right, all right. You're right, you're right. [clears throat] I'm quite sure she's a wonderful girl, or you wouldn't have fallen for her so quickly. I'm happy for you, son. What are you doing here? Whoa. Not so loud. What are you doing here? What? Can I help it if we have the same taste in restaurants? I'm going to give you one chance to walk out. Then what? Listen, Megan, this isn't about Johnson or your aunt or a bunch of old people you don't even know. This is about grabbing a story and running with it. If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen. Make the most of it and come out a winner. I'm sorry. I don't feel that way. Well, that's why you're still where you are. Sorry to interrupt, sir. I have those documents you requested. Excuse me. Something to take care of. Order me the sea bass. Of course. [scoffs] You act like Johnson is involved in some criminal activity. This is a construction job, not a mob hit. How can you defend him? Your aunt's getting booted just like the rest of them. Just stay away from my table. Whatever you say. - Everything okay? - Um, everything's fine. Where's your dad? He had some business to take care of. He'll be right back. If you could sign right here. Thank you, sir. Excuse me. Oh, no. Working after hours, Mr. Johnson? - This is private. - I'll bet. Here it is almost Christmas, and you just can't wait. - Can you? - Who are you? I write for Nightlife Style. I wonder what's going on. Um, Wesley, please stay here. I can't. ALEX: How could you live with yourself? Your greed is literally putting people on the street. What do you think now, Megan, huh? You know him? - Maybe. - Maybe? I'm her boyfriend. Didn't she tell you? What? Your boyfriend? No. No, he's not my boyfriend. You seem to know a lot about me. There's obviously something going on between you two, but I liked you. So I made an arrangement to develop a new property outside of town and bypass Sunset Villa altogether. What? I'll get this turned in. I am so sorry. I can't believe you. Susie, what are you doing here? - Have you seen this? - What is it? The online version of tomorrow's edition of Nightlife. Well, I guess I've intruded here long enough. [Megan sighs] "Like Father, Unlike Son." Read the last paragraph. "And in the days that we've come to know the Johnson family, it's difficult to believe that they are in fact plotting the eviction of so many of our senior citizens. How can a plan so heinous be considered progress at a time when so many have so little and need so much? What a sad ending to what might have otherwise been an uplifting story. Exposé by Alex Murphy and Megan Phillips." "Megan Phillips"? You can't think that I wrote this! One word at a time. You can't believe that. He must have put pieces of my article into his own work and then put my name alongside his. [sighs] Alex! It was Alex! Alex? Your boyfriend? - He's not my boyfriend. - But he was. How could anybody believe something so outlandish? You two used me to write some cheap story about my family. And you obviously worked together on this smear campaign to promote your own careers. I didn't. And you dragged the children into this. WESLEY: Unbelievable. I think we better go. Let's go. Wesley, you had-- You and I. ** * The first time I saw you I knew * * The spark that I couldn't undo * You okay? One more? [chuckles] I think maybe you should go home. Why? I bet someone's wondering where you are. I wouldn't be so sure. * And I knew that it was love * - * Oh, love - [ringing] * Come on, let's find a way Let me guess. I'm fired. Now simmer down, Megan. It's not the end of the world. Well, it's not the end of your world. Alex told me what he did, and as dumb as it was, thought he was doing you a favor. Some favor. It was only the online edition. We've pulled the piece already. All right? It'll never be seen again. I've... I've ruined everything. Megan, you can't let something like this hold you back. All right? You said you wanted to leave a mark. You wanted to mean something. Now's not the time to give up. Now's the time to dig down deep and find out what you're really made of. Find out what you really want out of life. It's there. Trust me. What I really wanted in life has been snatched away from me. Has it? Has it really? Think about it. Now, good night. [clears throat] Good night. [sniffles] Oh. [chuckles] Wesley hates me. His father hates me. Even I hate me. Beautiful work, everyone. You gonna help or just stand there and sulk? I'm gonna sulk, thank you. For what it's worth, I believe her. Why? That last paragraph. It's so badly written. Who uses the word "heinous" anymore? I don't know. Maybe her boyfriend did write all that stuff, but... what difference does it make now? Could mean a lot. Could mean everything. SUSIE: Just sayin'. [clears throat] Don't look now. It's from your father. Says he's inviting all the kids to a Christmas Eve's lunch, and he's not taking no for an answer. The limo's outside waiting. I figured he wouldn't even be speaking to me right now. Oh, well, uh... Guess it can't hurt. Let's rally the troops. ** * You gotta shake it up, Santa * * Ooh * You gotta shake it up, Santa * * Oh, yeah, yeah * You gotta shake it up, Santa Claus * * Grooving to the Christmas blues * * I said go, Santa, go * Go, Santa, go * I said go, Santa, go * Go, Santa, go - * Go, Santa, go - * Go, Santa, go - * Go, Santa, go - * Go, Santa, go Well, I'm glad you accepted my invitation. - Hi, Mr. Johnson. - Susie. Dad, I'm sorry about last night. That was all my fault. Forget about it, son. They pulled the article, they published an apology. No one of importance saw it. Well, that's something, I guess. What is this all about? I got to thinking all about your situation with the children, and, um, I got more than a few friends who might not mind stepping up to the plate to help out. What better way to find these kids homes than to get to meet likeminded people face to face? It's a wonderful idea. Well, you know, it all came to me... with a little help. What's she doing here? I invited her. This is a media-worthy event. She introduced me to her editor, and I believe she was telling the truth. See? Even your dad believes her. Why are you just standing here? Didn't expect to see you again so soon. Oh. I'm sorry. Your father left me a voicemail, and the reporter in me responded. I see. I can leave if you want me to. No. Uh-- You've got a job to do. Well, I only came here to talk to you. Good afternoon! I want to thank you all for attending my little holiday get-together. You know, it's not often we get the opportunity for everyone to be getting along so famously [Mr. Johnson chuckles] My son, Wes Jr., as you know, operates the Meadow Glen Children's Center. It is a selfless task he does with a lot of love and tireless dedication. But sometimes that's just not enough! That's where all of you... come in. So, please, take your time in getting to know all of these wonderful children, and let's make happen today... a little Christmas magic. [applause] No. No, no, uh-uh. Don't applaud me. I would have not known about this situation if it wasn't for the insights of Miss Megan Phillips. Please. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. [sighs] What you've done here today for these children is nothing short of a miracle. I tried to do some good things here, but... sometimes, as you said, trying is not enough. I can never sufficiently apologize for what happened. Please believe me that I never wanted to hurt anybody. 20 years ago, when I really needed it, a young boy gave me a Christmas gift. This notebook. And in that notebook, I wrote down all of my childhood hopes and dreams for the future. Some of them came true, some didn't. Wesley, you've touched the lives of so many. I thought I knew what I wanted most in life, and I worked really hard to get it, and then when I had it, I realized that... none of it was worth it. If the fragile thread that held everything together became unraveled, hold on tight to what you believe in. Don't let your dreams fall apart. Thank you. Thank you, Megan. Well, with all that said... [laughs] Hey, let's party! [applause] Why didn't you say something before? I was going to at first, but you said you didn't want the story to be about you, so I held back and then every time I even thought about it, it felt awkward, and I know I should have been upfront about it. I never thought I would meet someone who received one of my gifts, but here we are. I know. I never thought I would get the chance to thank you in person. Instead of doing that, I used you to boost my career. That's worked out great. It's all my fault. I don't know what I expected. I could've been a better man. I could've listened. I could've had some faith in you. You deserved a chance, and I didn't give it to you. What are you trying to say? Well... [chuckles] What did she say? She said that she still has a crush on you, but you're too old for her, so if I wanted you, I could have you. And what did you say? I do. [sighs] They're playing your song. Which one is that? Does it matter? No. Hey, Dad, thanks for everything. * You can't imagine * How good it feels to hold you right here in my arms * * At this holiday season * I like to make a wish upon a shooting star * * And ask for just one dance * * When I have you near me * I never want to let you go * Just one dance * I'm living a dream come true * * As long as I am here with you * * Here with you * Here with you * Just one dance with you Don't they make a lovely couple? * The years go by so quickly * * Try to take a moment to let it all inside * * Though I know I can't stop time * * And I know that things will change * * If you give me half a chance * * And in our hearts we'll always stay in this * * Just one dance * When I have you near me * I never want to let you go * Just one dance * I'm holding you here in my arms * * Forever, forever * Just one dance * I'm living a dream come true * * As long as I am here with you * * Here with you * Here with you * Just one dance with you
