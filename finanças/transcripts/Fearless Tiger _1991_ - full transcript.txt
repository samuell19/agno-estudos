[dramatic music] [men grunting] >> Come on, come on, get the shipment ready. We got deliveries to make. North America's waiting. >> We're not wasting time. >> Good. [dramatic music] >> Hello Yang, how you doing?>> Fine. >> Come with me.>> Uh-huh! >> How's business? Good.>> Okay. >> Okay. Please sit down. Understand that a businessman in my position must demand loyalty above all else. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that you have been stealing from me. >> No lies. >> We'll see about that. What's this? Does the statue look familiar to you? Nobody respects me. Boh! >> No, no, no. No Salamaar, no. [laughing] >> By the time we get to Toronto, Jerome will have the Nirvana already on the street. Airport. We've got a tournament to win. >> Hey, get your feet off the bleeding desk. We're getting more complaints about the drug addicts. And I want to know, what are you bloody well going to do about it? >> Working on it sir. I'm getting close on something. >> I'm getting close on some things. All you think about is entering those stupid tournament's and carrying that stupid gun. >> Really, sir? Some things are coming together. >> Enough, rubbish. I'm going to stay on your arse until you begin to achieve something. Or I'll have you off this case. [dramatic music] >> Okay. It's all clear. >> Nice of you to show up Jerome. So tell me, what's this new product you got out there in the street? You know, I don't like you messing in my established business. >> I don't know what you're talking about, man. >> No, think quick. [dramatic music] [guns firing] [automatic weapon firing] [tires screeching] [dramatic music] >> Gymnasium 3, we welcome our competitors from all provinces. [men grunting] >> On your marks. No points. >> Hey, no worries. This bald head is unbeatable. You'll be all right, you'll get him next time. >> Ooh whee, just be glad you met that guy in a gym and not on the street buddy. >> Hey, don't worry about it. That guy he's a killer. [dramatic music] Whatever he is and whatever he does, I guess I'm supporting him. I bought one of these souvenirs. >> Hey, I'm impressed with your fighting. You could be good. You need to train with a good instructor though. You know, if you want to train with Do Man, my system, come see me in Hong Kong. >> Sounds great. But I've got some serious responsibilities. >> Hey, keep it. Sometimes it will change your mind. [dramatic music] >> Paul Antrobus. [applause] >> Lenora Barns. [applause] Mel..... >> Hi Lance..>> Hey. >> Lyle Camille. Lyle Camille.>> I'm here, I'm here. [applause] [laughing] >> This is great. I never went to college and got a degree, a degree, a bloody MBA degree at that. >> It's nothing really. >> Nothing, it most certainly is something. Oh, you. You worked hard for this, I'm proud of you. >> Well, thanks. >> I'm looking forward to you coming on board. You know, I'm planning a semi-retirement and it'll be nice having family around that can run things properly. >> What about Lance? Let's not talk about Lance. That kid. >> See ya.>> Except for your mother's side of the family. [dance music] >> Salamaar, the Mongolian prince, been a long time. >> Mm-hmm! Yes. It's been a long time, Jerome. You know, I remember you as a man who used your hands and feet, but not a gun. >> I learned that guns gives an advantage. It kills quick. >> Black Pearls don't need a gun. How well, I remember. But I'm not here to talk about guns or Black Pearls. I'm interested in something far more lethal, Nirvana! >> What about it? >> It's been a wonderful success. My compliments to the chemist. >> What's the problem then? >> No problem. In fact, I want to produce it here. >> We can't move the lab. >> You don't have to. Get me the blueprints, the chemical formulas, everything on a computer disk. I'll build a lab. >> It's not necessary. Our distribution is doing good. >> For now, maybe but Nirvana's more addictive than crack. You'll never meet demand exporting in those little statues. >> I have a cover. I have a good relationship with our authorities. >> Great, but what about the Triads? Eventually they'll discover you're working their turf. And if they don't get you, the commies will. Nineteen ninety seven isn't that far off. >> You want to be a partner, again? >> Salamaar, get me the disk and we'll start a North American operation. Afterwards, Europe, Asia, Africa, everywhere. Think about it, my friend. It's a billion dollar a year business. [melodious music] >> Souvenir, all the way from China. >> Wonderful! Hey, get me another and I'll use them as bookends. >> All right.>> Promise? >> Sure, you know, if I promise anything, I'll always do it. >> Have you spoken to your father yet? >> About what? >> You know.>> No, tell me. >> Working at the company. >> What about it? >> Are you sure you want to work there? >> I guess so. >> As long as that's what you want. You've got so much on your mind lately, with the wedding and all. >> I know what I want. I'm heading over to the company, I'll see you later. I thought you quit this shit. >> No, I'm still working here. >> No. I'm talking about this stuff, what's this? >> It's fish food, man. >> Fish food? >> Yeah, one week of this boredom, you'll be begging me for this stuff. >> Quit your job if you hate it so much. Just tell Dad you're not into it right now. >> Oh, yeah, I'd like to see you try that. >> What's that supposed to mean? >> Oh, man. Look, you want to work here, about as much as I do. >> I'm looking forward to it. >> Yeah. You really want to work at a shopping cart company? You really want to marry that, Ashley kid, right. Deal with your own life, man, Why are you doing this to yourself? >> What was he mumbling about? >> Nothing. >> Typical. Follow me, vice president, I have something to show you. [phone ringing] [thunder rumbling] [statue shattering] >> We're going to be rich, boss. [thunder and lightning] >> Anybody home? Hello. [knocking on door] Lance, Lance. Lance, Lance. You there brother? [thunder rumbling] [clock ticking] [dramatic music] Lance, Lance. [dramatic music] [thunder rumbling] [dramatic music] >> Yo Lance, this is Slash from the pet shop. We got some more fish food for you. Tonight, be at the Beat Palace. [hard metal music] >> Is Slash in? >> He's in the back. >> Come on, get up, get up. [[hard metal music] >> Hey, what are you doing? Hey Slash. Tell me about fish food. >> I think I sold my Aquarium last year. >> Come on. >> Well that stuff, it's just pretty much flakes. Whack the fucker. Hey man, relax. >> You want to talk. >> All right. Some kind of opium freak. They call it Nirvana. >> Who calls it Nirvana and where could I get it? >> Man I don't know nothing, I'd rather die. His name's Jerome. >> Where could I get this Jerome guy? >> Aah, the Jag. He hangs at the Jaguar Club, all right. >> I hope you're right. >> You're fucking dead. >> Oh gosh, you bastard. You son of a bitch. >> What are you trying to prove? [dance music] >> Excuse me, where are you going, can I help you? Hey. >> Is Jerome in tonight? >> Excuse me, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. >> Relax. I don't know what your problem is or what you're trying to prove, but you're not going to do it here. Not ever, just go home. >> Yeah, yeah. Peng, is the offer still open? I have to get away from here. Okay, okay. [birds cawing] Dad, I'm not coming in on Monday. It takes time to work things out, I understand. >> No, I don't want to work at the company. >> I don't believe this. You were looking forward to it. >> No, Mr. Camille, you were looking forward to it. He was just too scared to disappoint you. >> Ashley, I'm not going through with the wedding either. >> What, we've planned everything. >> No Ashley, you planned everything. >> He was just too scared to disappoint you. >> How can you do this? >> I just decided, I'm not ready for this right now. >> I came to this country. I couldn't speak one word of English. I built this company from scratch, so that my sons could take it over. Now this. >> Dad, I want to work at the company, I want to get married, but there's something I have to do first. >> You're selfish. >> You're crazy. >> You're selfish and crazy. >> What is this thing you have to do? >> Something I've always dreamed about. [jet engine roaring] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] >> Just as you imagined it. >> Exactly. >> Hey. >> He looks hungry. >> He is hungry for drugs. His Do Yawo. They're taking over our streets. Do Man, this is Lyle the one I told you about. >> Nei ho ma. >> So you want to study here? >> Yes, I do, but... >> The philosophy here is that you work hard and listen to instructions. >> I guess I'm used to that. >> Good, because you have to stay here and prove yourself for a while. >> Great. Where do I put my stuff? [dramatic music] [speaking in Chinese] >> Do Man's giving you a hard time. >> He's freaking out on this drug problem. Neighbourhood has gone to shit. Used to be nice round here. >> Why don't you make some arrests, and clean things up. >> All the non-dealers are clean or at least clean of this Nirvana stuff anyway. Where does it come from? [men grunting] >> It will be difficult. >> It can be done on time. >> Why do I have to do it, Salamaar? >> Because I say so. It can be done. >> It will not be easy. >> Just get it done. It's important, it's very important. [speaking in Chinese] [men grunting] >> Come here. I came here to study the martial arts, if I wanted to do this, I would have got married. >> You must be patient. >> I'm not used to that. [men grunting] [dramatic music] >> You've got to be patient. >> You know, I could do this stuff. >> Do Man's, a wise old guy, he knows what he's doing. >> I don't think he likes me. >> If he didn't like you, you wouldn't be here. >> Uh! >> I know, hang in there man. [men grunting] >> I could do this stuff, let me show you >> Before you join the class. You must learn patience by learning patience, you learn martial arts. >> Does this mean I'm not allowed to join the class? Well forget this. I never should have come to this dump in the first place. [speaking in Chinese] [soft oriental music] >> Rough day. >> Yeah. I'm supposed to be a student at Do Man's school. They won't even let me take part in the classes. >> How long have you been there? >> A week. >> A week. You can't expect to get anywhere in a week. Takes years to master the martial arts. >> How do you know so much about martial arts? >> The movies, where else. >> You're back! >> Patience, that's the key, patience. I'm sorry, Do Man, I just got really frustrated. I came here, to study the martial arts. I ended up doing repairs. >> Teaching the martial arts is a great responsibility. I have had students who have gone and done bad things. Evil things. A true martial artist uses his skill only to defend himself or someone else. >> You thought I was some kind of an ignorant jerk? >> I still do. That's fine, Lyle. Don't be afraid of ignorance. Be afraid of not wanting to learn. >> I want to learn. I want to earn a red sash. >> Yes, but why do you want to earn a red sash? >> Because I've always been afraid to try for the first time in my life, I'm taking a chance. >> If you can take a chance, I guess I can take a chance. Now clean up the mess. >> Foreign drug lords, maybe they're importing the stuff somehow. >> Maybe they're importing the stuff somehow. You're hopeless. You haven't got a clue what you're doing. >> Don't be so hard on the boy. This is a very tough assignment. >> Mr. Crump, sir. Peng's been on this assignment for several months. So far, he's come up with nothing. Meanwhile, murder's up, theft is up, rape is up. >> I'm very well aware of the severity of this problem, but I don't want you getting the force into a panic. Peng.>> Yes, sir. Carry on with your investigation. You'll turn something up. >> Thank you, sir. I'll do that. >> This is absurd. He's either totally unqualified or he's on the take. >> I'll be the judge of who's qualified and who is not. As for being on the take. You better be bloody well sure of yourself before you make an accusation like that. >> Yes, sir. [soft music] >> You say you want to earn a red sash. Well, let's see. [dramatic music] [men grunting] [laughing] [dramatic music] >> You're learning fast, but you're way to stiff. You have to learn to flow.>> The flow. >> Yeah. It's different between Kung Fu and any other martial arts. Up on the mountain, Do Man's son trains there with his daughter. He's a master. Maybe he'll teach you something. [dramatic music] >> What are you doing here anyways? >> I'm here studying with Do Man. >> Why Do Man, why here? >> Because it's a challenge. I was supposed to get married. Real pretty girl. I was supposed to take over my father's business, make money. >> That sounds good. >> Nah! It was all too easy. My brother died. That made me see that life is about taking chances. >> What happened to him? >> He overdosed on some new street drug it's called Nirvana. >> That's, that's too bad. >> Let's go out tonight. >> I don't go out at night. >> Why not? >> I'm, I'm busy. >> How's it coming? >> It's complicated. It will take some time. >> How long? >> These formulas took me nine years to develop. It will not be ready tomorrow. >> How long, how long? >> Few months, at least. >> A few months, a few months. Okay, keep working Ren. This is my, our future we're working on. [dramatic music] >> What do you know about the BayMo? >> What BayMo? >> Come on, you always know about the underground tournaments. >> You want to know about BayMo no gloves, no rules, people get killed. >> I want to enter. >> Make a mistake in BayMo and you don't go home with a few bruises and good lessons, you get killed. >> I still want to enter, it's a challenge. >> To dangerous people like Boh be enters.>> Who? >> Boh the monk you fight at the tournament. >> He's no monk. >> What? >> I saw that guy at the Jag, an expensive nightclub. He was drinking champagne with some drug dealer. >> Are you sure about this? >> I'm positive. >> Let me ask you a favor. Anything, as long as you let me know how to enter, the BayMo. [dramatic music] >> That's the one. Jerome Horn! American. Drug dealer, Marine 1969 discharged for his involvement with secret network called Black Pearls. >> What does this mean? >> It means, police going to visit certain monk temple. [dramatic music] >> Salamaar there's a CID at the gate. [dramatic music] >> What can I do for you? >> Police, were here to search your temple. >> What are you looking for? >> What do you got? [speaking in Chinese] >> Hey Lyle, how you doing?>> Good, how are you Shaquille? >> How are you Lyle?>> Jacques, hi. >> Boh! >> What's he doing here? >> Competing, of course. >> Didn't you raid the temple? >> Yeah. we found nothing. All I managed to do is piss the big guy off. [applause] [speaking in Chinese] >> Fight!! [dramatic music] [men grunting] [applause and cheering] >> Out! >> Ready? Fight! [men grunting] >> Come on, come on. >> Come on Boh, hurt somebody, hit, hit hard. Be ruthless. >> Fight! >> Ooh. >> Fight! [men grunting] >> You bastard. >> Out! [Boh grunting] [speaking in Chinese] >> Fight! >> Aah! [cheering and applause] [rhythmic drumming] [rhythmic drumming] [cheering and applause] [dramatic music] >> Going to win do you think, come on Lyle. Get in Lyle, go, go. [men grunting] [cheering and applause] >> Come on, Lyle. >> Go!>> Come on, Lyle. [cheering and applause] [dramatic music] >> You really didn't find anything in that temple? >> Nothing but monks hand crafting these little statues. It was embarrassing. >> You can find these cheap things at every corner store. >> What's this about monks? >> We were at the monks temple this morning we thought they might be connected to a drug ring called Black Pearls. >> Black Pearls. I remember those guys from Nam. Ran opium through the jungles. Bad dudes man, real bad dudes. >> I know, I saw them with that drug dealer. I know I did. >> Wait a minute Lyle. Are you trying to say the Black Pearls are back in business? >> I don't know, but I'd like to find out. >> Don't bother me with anymore, Black Pearl talk. Far as I'm concerned, this case is closed. I'm going down the station, finalize my report, and you guys aren't coming? No way, no how, positively not. >> This has got to be the stupidest thing you've ever concocted. >> But he's a notorious drug king. >> It's the other guys, the ones with the bald heads and the robes. They're monks. I can't believe you raided their temple. We're going to take a lot of crap out of this. >> I have an eyewitness who says, two of these so-called monks, were seen with this drug dealer. I have an informant who says Black Pearl society have a long history of drug dealing. I have...>> All right. I'm going to take down your eye witness statements. Not because I think you've got any credibility, but because I want to prove to some people upstairs, what a complete idiot you are. >> What do you think will happen? >> Who knows? They do things slow at the station. >> Hey guys, it's probably nothing. Anyone could go around calling themselves the Black Pearls. >> Right. What does it really prove that they get the statues at the corner store, you know? >> If they're consorting with drug dealers, somebody has to go to the temple and stop them. >> Nothing personal Lyle. But it was a long time ago. And you were upset when you thought you saw them at the nightclub. >> I did see them together. I know I did. >> Whatever. Let's eat. [soft Oriental music] [telephone ringing] >> Yeah! Come on, they're onto us. We've got to stop them. >> So long.>> Bye-bye, goodnight. >> What's this scenic route? >> That's good. Short cut, keep it moving. [dog barking] >> This place sure is spooky at night, huh? >> Ah, what's this place got that my neighborhood ain't got? >> Black Pearls. [men grunting and yelling] >> Lyle! [sirens wailing] >> Lyle, police watch out. >> Did somebody forget to leave a tip at the restaurant or what? >> Bailey! Oh boy, Bailey, you corrupt bastard. >> Bailey! >> My boss, the one who took our testimony, he's the only one who knows our Black Pearl drug ring theory. >> He's connected to them. >> Let's find out. [dramatic music] [speaking in Chinese] >> Bailey! What are you up to? >> What are you babbling about? >> Black Pearls paid us a visit, that's what I'm babbling about. >> You're still going on about that Black Pearls rubbish? >> Who did you show that report to? >> Only Crump and he had a good laugh. >> The Black Pearls know we're onto them. >> Oh, yeah. And what are they going to do about it? [car engine starting] [moaning] >> Salamaar, what are you doing here? >> Why didn't you tell us about them? >> I, I didn't think it was important. They don't even get their facts straight. They think you're dealing with an American named Jerome. Salamaar, you'll need me. >> Like all important businesses, we're leaving Hong Kong. >> You used me you bastard. You're not a true Black Pearl anyway. A true Black Pearl doesn't need a gun. But sometimes, like to use them, just for fun. [gun firing] [woman screaming] >> So that is what they do. >> You know, them? >> Boh used to be a student here. He was recruited into some organization a short time before you arrived. If, they are responsible for this drug problem, I say kick their butt. >> But you said that a martial artist should use his skill only to. >> Yes, Lyle you must defend our street, our cure. [dramatic music] >> Aah! >> Jacques, what do you see? What's in there? >> Jesus! >> Jacques, what do you see? >> It's her the girl from the teahouse.>> Who? >> Loritza, Loritza! She's with the Black Pearls. No wonder you didn't find anything. >> Let's trash them.>> No! I've got a plan. Okay! >> You should quit the teahouse and work for me, full time. We are going to expand and you can have an important place in the new operation. I want you to love me, i want you with me. [speaking in Chinese] >> Aah! [man screaming] [alarm beeping] >> Fellas, looks like we got ourselves a rematch. >> Let's kickass. [dramatic music] [men yelling] >> Let's go. let's go. >> Hey, what's that for? >> Bookends! [melodious music] >> Good morning, I see you have earned your red sash. >> Yes, but I'm leaving today. >> You haven't finished learning. >> Yes, but I have my red sash. What else is there to learn? >> A red sash is not everything. Yes, and lots more to learn. Punch! You are tense, relax. See, you react fast because you lose. >> What else? >> Trust, inside. [dramatic music] If you would take the center first, you win. Relax! Relax! >> Why would you teach me all this? >> Ladies and gentlemen, our captain and crew, Hope you enjoyed your stay in Hong Kong. Please make sure your seat belts are fastened and observe the no smoking sign. >> Great! >> Isn't it? >> Yeah! >> Nah, you deserve a corner office. You're going to be taking on a huge responsibility here, >> Responsibility. I'm not used to that. >> To tell you the truth, neither am I. Have you, spoken to Ashley yet? >> About what? >> Getting married. Are you sure she's the right girl? >> Well, of course. >> It's a big commitment. You're going to be taking on a big responsibility here. Think about it son. Don't do something you don't want to do. >> Hi guy, come on, go ahead. No smoking in the gallery, please. Hi, come on in. >> Elaine speaking. Yes. Our hours are from 10 till 8 P.M. [people chatting] >> What are you doing here? >> I brought the other side of your bookend. >> I don't want anything from you. >> Ashley, I'm back now. I'm working at the company, I thought... >> You thought you could march into my life and say, here I am. Let's pick up where we left off, well forget it. >> I thought we could just talk. >> Talk, I don't want to talk to you, I don't want to see you. I don't want to have anything to do with you. >> What could he possibly want it? Is he going to sell it build a lamp what? >> I saw it, he's got it, he gave it to some broad, I checked her out, here's her address. >> Listen, guys. We have to get it back. My chemist was blinded and he's the only one who knows the formula. Our billion dollar a year business is dead. It's dead if we don't get it back. >> Okay, okay. She has it and we want it. We're going to pay her a little friendly visit. [knocking on door] [rock music] >> Who is it? >> Cookies for sale. Hi.>> Hi. >> Great. There you go. >> Thank you. Bye>> Bye-bye. [rock music] [window shattering][Ashley screaming] >> No, no no. >> Stop, relax. >> No disk. [telephone ringing] >> Hello. >> We want the disk.>> What? >> What are you deaf? >> Who's this? >> You heard me, we want the disk? >> What disk? >> What disk you're a classic? Salamaar get her over here. >> Lyle, Lyle. >> Ashley. >> Now, if you don't have the disk, maybe she does would a little strip search, turn up something interesting. >> If you have Ashley, I'll do anything you want. I don't know what you're talking about. >> Look man, we found the statue and we know you have the disk. >> Statue! [statue shattering] >> Is anyone there, can you hear me? Come on now, man, what are you doing? >> All right, all right, I'll give you what you want. We'll meet tonight at 8:00 o'clock, at the west wing of the Prince Gallery. >> Who says?>> The last room. >> Hey man I'll make the arrangements. >> You want the disk. you'll be there. >> Listen man, I'm not going to any gallery. [dramatic music] >> Okay, go ahead. [dramatic music] >> Metal detectors. >> Ah, who needs guns. [knocking on car window] >> Stash these and meet us around back. [dramatic music] >> Ashley, how are you baby? >> Fine now that you're here. >> This is real touching. Where's the disk? >> What are you guys doing here? >> Where's the disk? >> Hush up.>> Here's the disk. It won't do you any good though? You can't kill people and get away with it. >> We kill more people than you ever met. Boh the disk. >> Wait send her over first. >> First, the disk. >> Gallery closes in five minutes, folks. >> We're just leaving. >> Hey. >> Get him. [dramatic music] >> Come on. >> Start the engine. >> Let's go. [tires screeching] >> Get in Boh. >> Let's go. [tires screeching] >> They have to respect you, Jerome. >> He should never had it in the first place. Come on, will you move it, move it, move, move, move. [car horn honking] >> There, there, there, they're right over there. [rock music] >> Get them, get them man, get them. >> I'll get that goddam disk. >> Aah! [man on fire screaming] [rock music] [dramatic music] [steam hissing] [dramatic music] [tin plate clanging] [men grunting] [soft music] >> Ashley!
