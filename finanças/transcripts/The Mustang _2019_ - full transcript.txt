Subtitles by explosiveskull On your way home from work, you stop at the shopping mall to pick up some dinner. As you walk past a restaurant, you catch a glimpse of your partner with another man or woman. They are kissing publicly and very passionately. Up until this moment, you believed your relationship was stable, loving and committed. A. I don't feel angry at all. B. I feel slightly annoyed. C. I feel moderately angry. D. I feel very angry. E. I feel furious. At a karaoke night, your friends... Yeah. I know. Let's do it differently. Um, let me be more specific. You've been in isolation in Ely State Prison, and you've just been transferred here, back into isolation again. What do you think about that? As I said, this is your pre-classification meeting so that we can discover what options are available to you as you enter back into the general population. Is there a vocation you're interested in? Would you like to resume your education? It's just... it's real easy to get lost in the system. Especially when you come into a new facility and, you know, you're not from around here. I'm just trying to find out what's important to you. Is your freedom important to you? Is that something you think about? Are you listening to me at all, Mr. Coleman? Yeah. Yeah, what? Yeah, you're listening? Or, yeah, your freedom's important to you? - I'm listening. - Okay. Thank you. - Just get me back there. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! What? It's okay. Thank you. Sit down! Sit down. Sit down! I get it... you feel like you have no control in here. I get it. I understand that. I am giving you some control. That's what this is. And like it or not, you're gonna be reintegrated into the general population. Mm, I'm not good with people. All right. I can get you into the outdoor maintenance program, then. And while you're there, you'll have the opportunity to reflect on where you want to be. - Can I go now? - Yep. Open D wing! Pop 3. Want one? There you go, boy. Attaboy. Here you go. Start with this pile right here. You kidding me? No, man. When you get done with it, put it in that pile over there. What, you in charge here? Yeah, I'm the chief of shit-shoveling. Get for it. Get busy. All right. Let's go. Pop 3. You smell like shit. What the hell are you doing in there? Get out now! You never go in there. That's a dangerous animal. Don't ever fuck with him. You have a name? What's your name? Roman. Well, Roman, I don't need my yard and my lawn fertilized. So why don't you just take your wheelbarrow and your pitchfork, and get rid of all this shit. Coleman, visitor. All right. Very, very good. Good. Who the hell are you? I'm over here. Over here. Very good. Very cool. And, uh, maybe just one of you two, please. Okay, I love it. There you go. Okay. Okay. All right. And one of you two, please. Why are you here? All right. - Very good. - Thank you. I just need you to sign this. Thank you. Very, very nice. A little bit closer. All right. Very, very good. Good. Don't come back here. Very good. Very good. Thank you. Good day. And, uh, all right. Okay, guys. Now, is everybody ready? Yes, boss. 'Cause this one is particularly crazed. All right. So be very careful. And open the gate on three. One. Two. - Three! Let 'er rip! - All right, here we go! Goddamn. Son of a bitch. - Look at him go. - He's wild, man. Jesus Christ. Wyatt Earp right here. - Come on. - Goddamn! Look at that Wyatt Earp shit. Come on, now. How long you been standing here? Huh? I'm talking to you. Yeah, right. How long you been here? Okay, your turn. Come on. You... you can make a sound, right? You can speak? - Yeah, I can. - Okay. What's your name? I told you, sir, it's, uh, Coleman Roman. Coleman Roman is your name? That's a joke, right? Shut up, Henry. It's not funny. He's got a name. It's just backwards. You ever ridden a horse? - No, sir. - 5:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. - No, I'm just here for mainten... - Right? I'm just here for maintenance, sir. No, sir, you're not here for maintenance. You're here to do what I decide you're gonna do. And here's the drill. If you can stay in there for more than five seconds, you're in the program. Get it? You're in charge. Get him fed, get him watered, and get him calmed down. Your boots, Mr. Coleman. Yeah, they go on your feet. Fellas, fellas, fellas, good morning, good morning, good morning. Just in time. What up? - What's up? - Mikey. How you feeling? All right? Uh-huh. Good morning. Good morning, good morning. Hey, hey. What up? What up? What's up? All right, fellas. What's going on, Elijah? - Hey, man, what's up? How you been? - Yeah, yeah. - Top of the morning. - Ah, ah, ah, got the boots on. Oh, yeah, don't worry. You'll get used to it, man. Nice boots. Pop your cherry today, homeboy. Walking a little funny? It's definitely not their first rodeo. - Whoo! Cute in that orange. - Fucking with you, man. He's fucking with you. The whole purpose of this program is to learn how to break these wild horses and turn them into some horse of value that can be auctioned off in the next 12 weeks. Pays to keep this program running, and ultimately... our rehabilitation. And ironically enough, the police buy most of them. That horse is crazy, man. Yo, he's spooking out right now. - Why is that? - I don't know. Why don't you ask him? You ready? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Get back. Hey, listen up. 'Cause I'm the best trainer in here. See this? This is your hand. You always want to control your hand. What you want to do is find an opening, you know? Get him going. Hey, hey. You just want to get him going. And make sure you stay in the center. All right? Make him move around you. Come on. Now, normally, when you start a new horse, you can keep him right along the fence like he is right now. Because they're trying to keep as much space as they can away from you. All right? Now, the first thing you want to do is just establish direction. Get him going one way, and then send him the other way. And after you get that down pat, you can start working on the hook and the draw. Or, as I like to call, the touch. All right? Like I said, respect his space, okay? And he'll respect yours. And never look him in the eye. Get your ass in here. Come on, man. We ain't got all fucking day. Don't forget the stick. All right. Whenever you're ready, Roman Coleman. Hips, Roman. - Yeah, what about 'em? - Your shit is tight. You need to loosen it up a little bit if you want to connect with him, all right? I bet you don't have one good fucking dance move. Oh, this is gonna be fucking great. Where you going? - Where you going? - All right, look. Drop the stick. Fuck the stick. Put your hands up. All right? Establish a boundary. Now, tell your horse to back off. Back off. With your body. Back off. Back the fuck off. You're acting like a bitch right now, Roman. - Tell him to back off. - Back off. Back off. With your body, Roman. Come on. Come on, back the fuck off! It's good, Roman Coleman, but if you want to control your horse, first you got to control yourself. Yeah, you be the boss. You got it, Roman. Come on, get over there. Just keep working on them dance moves. Hips. Go over there. Go over there, man. Yeah, come on, move it. - There you go. - Come on. You're really not that bad for a first-timer. I'm actually pretty proud of you. I looked up, and that motherfucker just run straight over me. Then I look back up, and I got 15 horse cocks swinging in my fucking face. 'Cause you actually have to be on the horse, man. You spend more time on the ground than you do on your horse. Fuck you, Tom. Have you seen T-Bird? That motherfucker's a maniac, bro. He's not one of the lazy, squishy, donkey types. - Man, I'm telling you... - What, man? I'm just listening. Hey, what's your name again? Roman. Oh, you got the new horse, right? Yeah. Oh, the new horse! Uh-huh, hell yeah, when I first saw T-Bird, I was like, "I pity the fool that gotta ride that motherfucker." - Happened to be me. - Time's up. Come on, man. You know we got like three more minutes in here. You're done. Time's up. - Let's go! - All right, all right. What you looking at, man? All you need to be looking at is them hips, shoulders, hips, shoulders, hips, shoulders. Work on them dance moves, man. You'll be all right. Hey, Indian. What's up? - Hey. - Hey there. - Hey. - What up, man? How you feeling? Any better? - Ah, what up, dawg? - What up? - What up, fellas? - Yo, G. Yo, watch my back. That's a soldier, too. He got the crazy eye. There we go. I already signed that. You forgot to initial. All right, you two. Uh, now, don't look at the camera, but look at my finger over here. All right. Very good. Thank you. Emancipation? What the fuck is that? I found a job, I have a boyfriend, and I'm ready to leave. Just sign. My boyfriend's a mechanic. He's opening up a garage in Atlanta, and I'm gonna work there as a receptionist. Hey there. Would you guys like your photo taken today? Yeah, sure. That'd be great. - No, not really, man. - Yeah, it'd be great. Thank you. All right, come with me. Come with me. Come on, Dad. If you're all set, then why you need this? I'm selling Grandma's house in Bakersfield, but I can't unless you sign. All right, now, don't look at the camera. Just look at my finger over here. Okay. You can even smile if you like. Take your picture, man. - You can't sell the house. - I need to sell the house. Great. Just one more. Hold on. Uh, maybe you turn and face each other a little bit. - Great. - Yeah, we're done. That's a nice one. I need the money to raise this baby. Oh, so he got a daddy? Well, I ain't the Virgin Mary. So, why doesn't he take care of the baby, then? What do you know about taking care of a baby? What do you know about taking care of anything? - That house is mine. - Lower your voice. It belongs to me. Grandma left it to me. No, she left it to us. - Really? - Yeah. And you need it here? Here, where your clothes are washed, your meals are served. You have a bed. Shit, you're even tan. You're a dependent of the state, and it's like you're on permanent fucking vacation. Shut the fuck up! Yeah, I think you'd marry that horse if you could. Don't worry, homey. Your secret's safe with me. You should've seen him propose earlier, man. Hey, I think you already got engaged, homey, straight up. Whoa, someone's mad. Roman. Hey, Roman! Roman! You know, riding a mustang, that's the easy part. The hard part is... getting your hands on him in the first place. Isn't that right, Coleman? Why don't you come on over here and get in there and calm him down. - I'm not getting in there. - Do it. And not only do it; get it done. Go. Don't forget your stick. Soon as he turns around, you get in there. Come on. Come on. Now, get his attention. Behave yourself. Push him back. Hang in there, Roman. You're doing great. Come on. Yeah, that's it. Come on, you stop now. Yeah, come here. Come here. - Come here. You stop. - Come on, Coleman. - Block him up. - You stop. You stop! - Stop it! - Oh! You got game, son. Hang in there with him. - Get out of there, bro! - Get out of there! Get out of there! What are you doing?! Jesus Christ. What the hell are you doing?! Just get out of there! - Back off! Back off! - Get him out of there! Back off! Thomas! Bring the ketamine and tranquilize him! Coleman, can you breathe? Easy, easy, easy, easy. Man, come on! Esme at the horse program. I never want to see your goddamn face again. Psst. Psst, psst, psst, psst. Shit. And walk. Come on, Coleman, get up. I got a cellblock to feed. Psst. What do you want? - A magazine. - I got you. No, no, no, not like that. Marquis. Marquis. That's it, that's it. Come on. Yeah, good boy. Good boy. Now, come with me. Come with me. Come on. That's it. That's it. That's it. Now, don't come here. Don't come here. And stop. Okay, get back there. Get back there. Come on. Coleman, out of bed. Come on, man. Hurry up. - What's going on? - Get dressed. Nasty thunderstorm seven miles out. Need all the riders we can get. Let's go. - Mikey! - We gotta get control on this side! Watch out! Get that horse out of that pen over there. Hey, knot the fences. Knot the fences. The horses... they could hurt themselves! - Get 'em out. Get 'em out. - Get 'em out. Come on, get them out of here! Okay. Easy. Calm down. Easy. Come here. Come here. Easy. Yeah. Come on. Yeah, that's it. That's it. Come on. Come on. Easy. Easy. Hey. Hey! - Come on, get bridles on them and get them out! - Come on. Let's walk them down to the kitchen. All right, fellas, let's make some room in here. Try to get as many horses in here as we can. - Hey, hey! - Mikey! Can somebody bring an extra halter? I'm right here, okay? Easy. Tom, you okay? Mikey, you okay? Stop that. Stop that. Don't do that. - Stop that. Stop that. - Move back! Henry! No. Henry, get back! Yo, back off! I got you. Jesus Christ. Yeah, he's straight now. All right, it's good, man, it's good. - You all right? - Straight. - There? - Yeah, right there. All right. You're all right, yeah. You're all right, pal. Relax. Coleman. You're back. If you ever hit another horse, I'm gonna see you do ten years in a psychiatric ward. - You got that? - I do, sir. Thank you. You earned that. We got four weeks before the auction. Let's see if you and your horse can catch up. - How's your horse? - Doing all right. Them Latinos is running into us later today, homey. Yeah, price is gonna blow up - at that auction, man! - Ah, yeah! Hey, come on, give T-Bird a kick. Oh, damn! You want to be top seller, huh? - And he can still cha-cha. - All right, all right. That's what I'm talking about. That's right, homey. Do the Macarena. Hey, bud. It's me. Come on. Ah, what the fuck? Look like somebody mad at you today, huh? Ah, he won't listen. He won't let me approach him. I wouldn't let you approach me, either, motherfucker. All right, cowboy, look. Jump in the middle. It's real simple. When both ears pointing one way, to the front, he's happy. When they're both pointing to the back, he ain't so happy. You see his ears? Well, just tell me what to do, all right? You got to be patient, man. You got to be patient if you want to get your hands on him. It's a real nice horse you got here, man. What'd you name him? I haven't named him yet. Everybody need a name, Roman. It might be the reason he's not coming when you call him. I read something about a guy who could gallop so slow it took him an hour to go 300 yards. That's the whole story? That's slower than that mule over there. - That's very unimpressive. - No, no, no. It's about controlling strength. He was using silk reins. - Silk rein? - Yeah. Okay. Guy's name was Marquis. Look alive. We got happy ears. Marquis. Now that you figured that part out, you might as well go ahead and jump in the middle. All right? Be on his time. And remember what I told you about your shoulders? You got to loosen up. You got to loosen up. - What's up? - Hey, what's up, homey? What's up? That's what I'm talking about! Hey, all right. I think so, boss. I think so. You turning your back on me? All right, come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on! Stay there. All right? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! All right. All right. Now, just stay there. That's it. That's it. Easy. Good boy. Come on. I'm tired, man. You're tired, too. So, let's... let's do it. Come on. Please. Please stay there. Please, come on. Come on, please. Come on, stay there, man! Just fucking listen to me! Do you hear me?! I'm not gonna hurt you! You hear me?! You hear me, you stupid animal?! Hey, bud. Where you going? Hey, stay here. Oh, my God. What a business. But to really get his attention, you got to use your hands. Attaboy, Coleman. You're getting it. The horse needs to feel you and him are in sync. Whoa. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy. - Come on, keep going. - Yeah, man. - All right. Looking good. Looks like he's ready to ride. - Oh, really? - Yeah. But loosen the rein on his neck. - Shh. - That's good. Right there is perfect. Right there is perfect. Keep going. Keep going. - That's it. It's balance. - There you go, nice and easy. It's all about balance and not getting discouraged. Good job out there. Way to stick with it. - Thanks, man. - Yeah, man. - Great work, man. - Thanks. He thought I didn't see that shit. Hey, man, what'd I tell you? Hips, shoulders, hips, shoulders, baby. You still can't fucking dance, but you might be a cowboy in no time. Let me tell you. You know it won't fucking kill you to smile, man. That shit's free. It don't cost nothing. Pop 3! Hey, bud. How's the farm? How are you? I heard somebody's smuggling the ketamine. None of my business. Well, now it is. Your daughter's real pretty. We want to taste that dope on Monday morning. What's your problem, man? Huh? Trying to get sliced up? What the fuck you doing that for? You better stay there, boy. Stay away from my gang. Back to the game. That's right, motherfucker. - Lift some weights. - Get out of here. Come on, man, keep walking. That's good. All right, that's it. Yeah, why's that? Hmm? You know that... at six months, a fetus can suck its own thumb? Pretty crazy, ain't it? Our guys out there know where your daughter lives. She wasn't hard to find. Sleep tight, John Wayne. The auction's in two weeks. You got to be ready. Stay in sync with him. What? Stay in sync with him. If you pull back, he's gonna stop. If you spur him, he's gonna go. - Make up your fucking mind. - That's it. Come on. That's it. Now you got it, goddamn it. There you go. There you... Why-why do you spur him? Why do you spur him?! Goddamn it, don't pull his head back! - That's it. - That's all? Yeah. I'm not the only one doing this. You're gonna have to wait a week or two. That's not gonna work. Coleman, stop pulling and pushing. He doesn't know what message you're trying to send him... to stop or go forward. That's good. Now, that's it. Stop. Now go forward. Move him forward. Move him forward! Now you're getting it. Now you got it. Straighten up, cowboy. Now you got it. Now you got it. Goddamn it. Who knew? I got the touch! I got it! That's right, Roman. You got it. - You see that? - Go ahead, now. I got it. You following me? All right. Go there. Come on. What did I tell you? Go there. Huh? Hey. Why you not listening to me? Give me some space. That's it. Give me some space. Welcome to today's restorative justice session, otherwise known as anger management. I want to commend you all again for making the courageous decision to understand and address the harm that you caused the victims of your crimes. And welcome to our new participant, Roman Coleman. Roman, thank you for making the choice to come. Today, our goal is to experience empathy, to understand the power of an apology and to be open to our faults. Who would like to start? Remember, this is a safe space. You guys have already made a lot of headway here. I got, uh, ten years for manslaughter. And how long from the thought of the crime to the actual crime? - About a second. - About a second. 17 years for strong-arm robbery. 18 years. For what? For first-degree murder. Since I was 14. And how long from the thought of the crime to the actual crime? Just, uh... well... just spontaneous. Ten seconds. Five seconds. 22 seconds. About three seconds. How long have you been in prison? 12 years. And how long from the thought of the crime to the actual crime? Split second. Thanks for coming. It was nice what you wrote to me. So, what is it you want to tell me? I'm working outdoors... with horses. - Horses. - Yeah. The ones you see on your way in here. I'm riding 'em. I'm training 'em. We got this auction thing coming up next week. I'd like you to come. Sounds fun. I think you'd like him. His name is Marquis. That's my horse. You think riding horses can change anything? I want to ask you something. Something I don't deserve. I know that. I want you to hear me out. What's that? There's so many things... ...I've been wanting to say for such a long time. I'm not who I used to be. I... Whatever happened was an accident. I never meant to hurt her. And whatever I've done... ...you'll always be my-my baby girl. I'm listening. Come on, sit down. Sit down. I-I don't remember everything. She flushed... my party stuff... down the drain. She was looking out for me, and I didn't see it like that. She started yelling. I started yelling. We got into a fight. Running around the house. And she hit me. I hit her back. I was so angry. So I hit her head against the sink. Until her skull cracked. I was a kid. I... I was a kid. You left me alone to take care of my mom. To dress her and feed her and wipe her ass and give her her medicine every day. Do you know what that was like? Do you know what that was like? I love you. I love you so mu... You'll never know. One day, someday, I'll make it up to you. I promise. I just want to say to all of you, we're not training these horses for little kids' birthday parties and pony rides. Some of these horses are gonna go and protect the United States border down there. So you got to get 'em used to racing and chasing. - Got it? - Yes, sir. - Yes, boss. Tell you what, man. You see my cousin, - you run the other way, all right? - Mm-hmm. Come on, we're out of here, Thomas. Get down! Everybody on the fucking ground now! Everybody on the fucking ground! Now! Down, down! Everybody down, down! - Don't move! - Face in the dirt!

You fucking piece of... You fucking piece of shit. Guard! Spirits never break. I don't know that my spirit's broken, but it took a hell of a beating today, I'll tell you that. I'll ride his horse. Okay. Get it done. Proud to work with you. - Good night. - Night, boss. - Night, boss. - Good night. See y'all tomorrow morning. We'll ride for Henry. Nice. Come on. You ready? Yeah. You think she's gonna come? Hmm? Well, folks, thank you for showing up, and I want to welcome you to the 25th Nevada State Wild Horse Inmate Auction. Okay, everybody, get ready. It's almost showtime.

Go out there and tell your horse you're sorry. 'Cause when the vet gets here... he's gonna put him down. - What are you talking about? - That surprises you? You have to remember something. I've worked with horses a long goddamn time. And some you can break... ...and some you can't. And you know what else is a real shame?

Marquis. Marquis. You got to go. When I say go, you go. Okay? Marquis, get out of here. Get out there! Down now! Coleman, get on the fucking ground! I'm not going anywhere! - I'm not going anywhere. - Get on your knees! I promise, I'm not going anywhere! Get on your knees! Put your hands on your head! Onto the ground!
