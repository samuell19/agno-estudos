If you can grasp what the waves are telling you, you can walk on water. I've never tried to walk on water. What can waves tell us anyway? When age replaces time, the world's horizons become our memory. Today, the future is behind me. Only the past lies ahead. It took a while, but I tracked her down. She's secretary to a big lawyer. I tried to contact her, but she refused to talk to me. She won't see anyone. It's understandable. All she's been through... Is this all right? Younès... This is 1970. Knots aren't done like that any more. They're bigger. You look great. You'll find her here. Thank you. You're welcome. I must go. I've a train to Paris in 2 hours. How is it back there, Younès? Fine. - But it's not the same. - It's not the same here, either. That's life. There you are! - Did you do well? - Three A-s! Come on. Happy to see Mummy? Did you really get three A-s? - Yes! - Can I see your report? - You want to? - Of course! Algerian countryside 1939... Come here! - Take this to your father. - Thank you. WHAT THE DAY OWES THE NIGHT From the novel by Yasmina Khadra. Look, son. God be praised. He hasn't abandoned us. Daddy! The caid! Allah be with you, Issa. And you too, "Mr Caid". I said to myself, "I'm going to make a little detour and see my friend Issa. "See how he's getting on". Your field's a beautiful sight. You'll have a fine crop. When do you harvest? In a week, thanks be to God. And the money I lent you for seed. May God return it to you. Insha'Allah, I'll repay it in a month. Think it over. My mind's made up. I'm not selling. You're a stubborn man. As stubborn as the Mahieddines. So am I. I'll persuade you some day. Goodbye. Daddy! My God, why? All right, Sergeant? Fine, sir. No resistance. Daddy, do we have to go? Hey! Over here! Come on! I don't suppose you can write? Your thumb... Here... and here. Sorry, Mr. Mahieddine, it's the law. We'll start a new life. Let's hope you find work. You don't find work in Oran. Work finds you. - Are we done here? - Yes, we can go. Hey! Where we're going, we can't take him with us. Come on, up you get. I was so very sad. I had to accept it, forget this woman. I took the boat home that night. Early the next morning, I was sad, but happy to see Oran as I did on that first day. I was 10 when we came here. It was another planet, another world, another life. It's already so long ago. Mr. Mahieddine... Come in. I didn't know he was your brother. I didn't believe him. Issa's in town with his family. Really? I don't believe it. That's what he says. I'm going to see. I've been longing to meet him. Where are they? I rented them a place. It's not a palace, but... In Jenane Jato. Can you imagine? Was there nowhere better? Wallah, I felt sorry for them at the station. I did what I could. Invite them to live with us. I'll see. Out of the way! Mind the well, it's deep. A kid fell into it and died. Poor boy. Issa! Why are you here? I might ask the same question! I'm your older brother. You come without a word! I find you in a slum! What happened? I lost everything. Why didn't you say? - I'd have helped you. - How? What's done is done! It's God's will. No one steals our land! Don't you understand? I'm finished with the land. Leave me alone! Go inside. You sure he's your brother? Open up! I don't need you! This is his son and his daughter. Really? Is that you, Younès? I can't believe it! Zahra! I'm Mohamed, your uncle. Recognise me? How would he? When did you last visit us? It's 8 years since you last prayed at our parents' grave. Listen, Issa, I always fear offending you. I just want to help you. You've a wife and kids. My family! I'm your family! - It's not the same! - It is! You're my brother. Your son's like my son! Do you want him to be a shoeshine boy? What do you mean? Younès is my son. Not a dog! You can't stay here! Think about it. I've made up my mind. We don't need your money. You know the worst thing about us? Our pride. You're a mountain of pride. A mountain. That's what you are. What's that look for? You have to trust me. I'm your father. You hear me? Your father! My God! May God be your guide, Issa, and be with you. We need men to unload flour. 4 francs a day. How many are you taking? Me, sir, me...! Take him, he's all right. I'll be back, Younès. I'll be back! You want some candy? Help yourself. Pretty boy. Leave him alone. Or I'll cut off your other leg! Dog! That's all today. Get your pay. You said 4. I've only 2. 2 is all you get. That's not what you said. Go on, beat it! Next. Beat it! Don't worry, God is with us. We'll get by, Insha'Allah. Stop it, Younès! Daddy, look. - What is it? - It's for you. I asked what it was? A friend and I caught and sold them. I swear we didn't steal them. You want to humiliate me, too? Daddy, I... You know what we call a man who can't feed his family? A dead man! He's dead. His heart beats, he talks and breathes, but he's dead and knows it. Issa! You think I'm finished? Is that what you think? I'm hurting you! That's the pain I feel deep inside. Be patient, son. God, help me! I beg your forgiveness, God. Good morning, Mr Makhoud. We need to talk. Come in. You were right. I can't keep him. Give him his chance. I'm not disowning you. You'll always be my son. It's meant to be. Daddy! Don't cry, Younès. You'll be fine with us. Come on. Madeleine! My nephew, Younès. This is your aunt Madeleine. He's staying with us. His father agreed. Really? He's so handsome! I bought some clothes. I hope they fit. Look at his eyes! Like my father's. Come on. Time for a bath, Jonas. My name's Younès! Not any more, darling. Make yourself useful and heat up some water. Of course. Zohra, come and empty the tub. Of course. - There! - It's lovely. What you see, Younès, is the trace of our ancestors. Even in this suit, never forget where you come from. Never. He's so handsome. Eat, Issa. A last-chance meeting is taking place in Munich between Hitler, Daladier and Winston Churchill. Europe awaits the outcome of these talks. Will I live here forever? Yes, dear, it's your house now. This is your home. I'll enroll you in school tomorrow. It starts soon. Don't worry, I'll help you catch up. When will my sister and Mummy come? I'll close the curtains. You can have a nice, long sleep. Goodnight, sweetheart. Try not to go rat-a-tat-tat like a machine gun. Think of something gentle... A crab running across sand, leaving no tracks. See the crab, Emilie? - Yes. - Good. Start again. Try it. Start again... I want to hear the crab. That's better. It's the gardener! What do I say? He's so annoying. I'm coming! Do the crab for two bars. Fingertips! That's good, Emilie. Very good. Hello. I'm Emilie. And you? Do you live here? Is Madeleine your mummy? I just moved here. I'm living with Daddy. Cat got your tongue? He's shy. His name's Jonas. It's a nice name. Go outside. I'll bring you a snack. Coming? It's beautiful here. Look at the ship! When I grow up I'll be a captain. With Madeleine, I discovered an unknown world. France. She eased me into it gently. Just 1 km separated me from my little sister, Zahra, and yet, like my father, I'd just gone through the mirror. Slowly now, children! No running. Did it go OK? - All right, my love? - Fine. And you? The boy seems bothered. Can you talk to him? Hello, my boy. Working hard? What happened at school today? I hear you came home cross. You can talk to me. I'm like your father. Someone in class said Arabs are lazy. Is it true? Of course it is! At least, that's what the French say, because we Arabs take time to live. It baffles them. For them, time is money. For us, freedom is priceless. I want to show you something. Come on. This is Lala Fatma, your great, great aunt. When the French came to Kabylia, she raised an army and fought like a lioness! Your father has Lala Fatma's spirit. Be proud of him. - Who's he? - A very great man... Go on, don't stop. His name is Messali Hadj. Never forget it. He'll restore Algerian dignity. Your uncle's brave but a bit idealistic. It's why you love me. Do your homework. Make your father proud. Careful, Mohamed. It's dangerous. If we don't take risks, what happens to him? The contempt has to stop, and the humiliations. Zineb, come and see! Look how handsome your son is! I've missed you so much. I've missed you, my love. Where's Daddy? Go to your uncle's. Your father's out late. Your life is there. Go on, my son. There's nothing for you here! Nothing at all. Mummy, I'll come and get you. I know you'll come back, my son. Get out of here! Run! Run and don't look back! Get the hell out of here! Don't ever come back! Pay if you want a drink! Get lost, drunkard! Daddy... Whatever got into you? 38°! Won't you tell me where you were? And in this rain! Just look at you. Tell me. What's wrong? Try to sleep. She came to surprise you. Hear that? She worked on it, just for you. I'm sure she did. Go on! Go and see her. - Did you like it? - Lots. I really like you. I'm your friend. Bring me Mrs. Chiche's herbal teas. Top shelf. Mr. Mahieddine? Criminal Investigations. We've a summons for you. Follow me. I can't find them. - What is it? - No idea. - I've done nothing. - Come on. Sorry, sir. What's he done? Don't worry. See to Mrs. Chiche. She's been waiting. - Head down. - The station. Will you hold him long? What do you know about his political activities? Not much, but I respect his views. Are meetings held here? - Read these? - I know the Messalists' line. A French woman with an Arab is pretty unusual. It can't be easy. Neither can living with stupidity. - What's going on? - Jonas! Is it the naval base? 3 July, the Mers El Kebir tragedy. Admiral Darian had ordered the fleet to defend itself against attack. When the English Navy tried to seize the position French and English clashed. French ships sank, men died. The English say they feared a German takeover of the French fleet. Lots of people near the port died, Emilie's dad said. Forget about it. Eat up. It's Bliss! They were getting water. The bomb killed them outright. I saw it all. Both of them. Mother and daughter. This belonged to the little girl. It's all that's left. What a pity! It was hard to get. But with God's help... Thank you, Bliss. Thank you. And his father? There's been no word for a long time. He upped and left. - Nobody's seen him? - They say he went south. To the desert. Ah well! May God protect us. - Won't you eat something? - No, thanks. They released me to make people think I betrayed my friends. I'm dishonoured. Passed off as a squealer! I said nothing. I swear on my mother's life, Madeleine! - I said nothing. - I know. I know what they can do. We'll sell everything. Oran's over for me. We'll sell the house, the shop... - Are you crazy? - It's over. It's over! We're going. We can't even stay for the boy. Come here, son. I've something to tell you. You must be brave. Your mother and your sister... Hurry up! I'll miss you, but Mrs. Torres is very good. We studied music together. She won first prize. - Be careful! That's fragile. - It's fine, Madam! Use both hands, put it in the box gently. - Where are you going? - Not far. Rio Salado. If you go, you don't love me. Don't cry. That's not why I'm crying. I liked Rio Salado. Uncle was right. It was the countryside. I returned to life, happy to smell soil again. Most people had Spanish origins. But there were Jews and Arabs. And a boy unsure of what he was. So, here's our new pharmacist! Juan Rucillio, farmer. I met your wife in church. I wanted to meet you. Mohamed Mahieddine. A pleasure... It'll seem small after Oran. Davouts Square, right? Right. The city's tiring. I'd had enough. And this big boy's your son? Yes, his name's Jonas. - How old are you? - 10. Like Isabelle. Come here, darling. Meet Jonas, he's new here. Look after him, will you? If you like, Daddy. Life's quiet here. Can you credit the English? That's the way it goes. The Marshall reacted with dignity. Don't you think? Good morning, Madam. - Mayor. - Call me René! You're one of us now. We needed you! I'm taking him away. Everyone's waiting! A grape harvest festival meeting. - See you soon. - Bye. Goodbye. Why say he was our son? Instead of what? His mother's died in a slum and his father's missing? We're unknown here. He's got your name, hasn't he? Still... I don't like lies. One! Won't you listen to the band? We can hear it, Sister. Hello, boys. Who's he? What's your name? - Cat got your tongue? - He's Jonas. Leave him alone. What grade are you in? Sixth grade. We'll see each other. He's Jean-Christophe. He's stupid. He says we're in love, but I don't care. Come to my house on Sunday. I'm inviting you. That's Grandpa. I love him, but all he does is eat and sleep. Do you want a cake? What about me? Don't I get a bit of cake? Of course, Grandpa. What did I say? Here, it's chocolate cake. Something else? No thanks. You're wearing a mask, but I knew right away. Why are you with the French? Does she know? Liar... It's delicious, Grandpa. I'll show you around. You'll see how big it is. Hurry up, it's getting late. - Isabelle. - Hello. Come on. Hurry up. Run...! - I'm glad to see you. - Me too. Good morning, children. Morning, sir. Good morning, miss. - Marcel Andrieux? - Here, sir. - Bruno Darras. - Here, sir. Julien Cassandre. Julien Cassandre! Absent already. Simon Benyamin. - Here, sir. - Finally. Roland Francesqui? Lamy, if you don't mind! Roland Francesqui? Here, sir. Jean-Christophe Lamy. Here, sir. I hope your behaviour's improved over the summer. Yes, sir. Younès Ma... Mahieddi... Mahieddine? Younès Mahieddine? Jonas, sir. Here. Jonas, right. Fabrice Scamarroni? Here, sir. I hope you'll work as hard as you did last year. Yes, sir. So! Have an excellent school year. We'll start it off with a song in praise of Marshal Pétain. Isabelle! What? He says his name is Jonas, but it's really Younès. You invite him round all the time? Come on. Jonas! Liar! You're a dirty liar! - Why say that? - Why? Is your name Younès by any chance? Why call yourself Jonas? - It's the same. - No, it's not! I'm a Rucillio! I can't love an Arab! Hear that? An Arab! Hey, you! It's bad to lie. Leave me alone. Who do you think you are? Look down and apologize. Look down or I'll hit you! Stop it, Jean-Christophe. Are you crazy? He didn't do anything to you. You've got one minute to tell me who did this. - I fell, sir. - You fell. You think I'm stupid. There's a price to pay. Hold your hand out, palm up. I'm glad to see at least one person in this class with guts. I'm telling you, he's not coming. He'll come out. Just wait. - You're sure? - There he is. Don't go too far! And please be careful. Let's go. Take care. Don't swim out too far. Wait for me! Where are you going? That way! Come on...! Don't be scared, I just want to talk. It's about Mr. Paoli. That ruler hurts, I know. From now on you're my friend. Friends forever. Forever. There's an important thing. Before you join the gang. Oh yes. You have to pass a test. - A hard test. - Really hard! So? OK. Let's go. Where is he? I don't believe it! - I won! - No, you didn't, you cheated. We'll do it again. Summer 1953 Nice one, Jonas! - Simon! I just put some oil on! - Relax, Isabelle. Is your brother coming? Yes, with the picnic. No chance of any shade with Djelloul. The pole! Look at the poor guy. Don't mock. Nice djellaba! - I'm hungry. - What's new? The Ganassaiens are eating. They've twice what they need. It's time to eat! Here comes your brother. I'm saved. Dédé! All right? Let's go, girls. My saviour. Look at that idiot! I don't believe it! Djelloul, come here! Is that how I said to do it? What are you doing? You idiot! Donkey! - Dédé. - What? - Where's the picnic? - Dammit! I forgot it. Goddamn shit! Come on. Go and get it. Go on! Be quick. Go on! Walk. That'll teach you. Rucillio, that's a bit much. - In this heat! - Jean-Christophe, you don't have staff. Arabs and octopuses relax when you beat them. - Knock it off. - Don't talk like that. You're a jerk! That's what you are! Kiss him on the mouth, why don't you? You know what they say about Jews and Arabs. - Don't you? - We Jews say screw you, OK? - America did you no good. - Can it, Fabrice. I don't give a shit about your Jeep! He's nuts. What are you doing, Fatso? Screw your shitty American Jeep! I'm going to kill you, Fatso! Get off! Wait till I catch you! I'll make you eat your underwear! Go on! Run! Not the Jeep, got it? Hey, you know what? We're not fighting over some dirty Arab! - I love you, Fatso. - Right. Get up! - Asshole! - What are you doing, Jonas? Hey, Jonas! - Bravo! - I was kidding! What did I say? - Nothing. - You call that nothing? I was trying to be funny, Fabrice I'm sorry, OK? Hey, Jonas, come back, damnit! Thank you. Don't mention it. - You're from Rio Salado? - Yes. I'm the pharmacist's son. You assholes! We cooled you down! You'll get sunstroke staring at her. You're really dumb! Come on, Jonas, it's only fun. Wait for me! Isn't she beautiful? I don't know her. That's Mrs. Cazenave. She's new. Her husband's prison governor in Cayenne. The jerk let her escape. He had no choice. They're divorced. And divorced women are red hot in bed! Goddamn it! I'm sorry guys, OK? You'd have got sunstroke! Good morning. - Am I disturbing you? - No, not at all. I'm revising for exams. In pharmacy? Like your father? I'm studying in Algiers. Good for you. You look so young. I came for my ointment. Maybe you prepared it? No, not yet. I've pain in my back. It's from French Guiana. The humidity was excruciating. It'll be ready this afternoon. What a shame. Could I ask you a small favour? Would you bring it to me? I live behind the Jewish cemetery, on the hilltop. Yes, I know it. I'll... You'll bring it to me. Thank you. It's very sweet of you. What are you doing? I brought Mrs. Cazenave's medicine. Give it to me! - I'm to hand it to her. - Are my hands too dirty? Krimo, let the young man in. I've been waiting. Come in. My grandparents lived here. Your name's Jonas, right? Your friends called you that on the beach. That's right. It's an unusual name. How old are you? - I'm 23. - Lucky you. It's so hot. Well? The ointment? Smells good. I hope it eases the pain. It's killing me. - I could massage your shoulders. - I was afraid to ask. It's mostly high up, in my neck and then down my back. Are you shy? No, ma'am. Shyness is a lovely thing. You shouldn't fight it. We mustn't... You're so handsome. It's you that's beautiful. No, you're not under house arrest. Just let us know whenever you're leaving town. Same thing. What's this about? Know anything about the Special Organisation? Only what the radio says. Don't be smart. The Oran central post office robbery funded an armed military operation. What's it to do with him? We know your husband's beliefs. My husband's "beliefs" are pacifist. I detest violence. Glad to hear it. Your PPA activist file has followed you here from Oran, hence these measures. - What's going on? - I don't know. You know what people will think? We must be vigilant. The Sétif Revolt in '45 taught us that. Where were you? Your son? When he remembers. Military service soon? No, I've a deferment to study pharmacy. I hope you'll be as good as your dad. Don't forget to call. Madam... Everything's fine. Out of the way. - What's this about a call? - It's nonsense. Did the delivery go well? Yes, very well. Next time I'll do it. The wolf will always be the wolf's son. - Hello, Bruno. - Hi, Jonas. - So? - How are you? - Fine, and you? - Yes. Where are you off to? We're going for a drink. Marcel, the same thing, please! I'm coming! - OK? - I'm fine? How you doing, Jonas? - Recovered yet? - It's you we should ask! We went to Oran yesterday. Rue de l'Aqueduc. What a blast! My girl was supposedly from Brittany. Brigitte. - She was extraordinary! - Let me tell him. I go in, she's waiting for me on the bed. Not only was she from Brittany by way of Algiers, but she was a sea elephant! She was so fat I couldn't see the bed! The best is yet to come. He came back down with gum stuck on his forehead! She did it! She had some gum she'd finished with. She stuck it there while I was busy! I came down, right between the eyes. Is that Dédé? - What's he got now? - Come here! It isn't Rio Salado with him, it's Rio Grande! - What's this? - A Cadillac Deville. V8 engine. - What a car! - This is José. - He's working here. - I'm working here. He's my cousin. He was wounded in Alsace. He lost one of his balls. He's limped ever since! So... What do you think? - It's modern. - Great, isn't it? That's not all. Jonas? Why are you leaving us? Think you're Louison Bobet? Beat them in the mountains! The best is yet to come! It's American. They call it a jukebox. Looks like a radiator. It's triple-phase. It won't work here unless you change the plug. Djelloul! You saw it's triple-phase? Change the plug. Change what? - The plug. - I'm no electrician. Do it yourself! - You're right, fight back. - Let him have it. I'll do it. Give them a drink, it's on me. Djelloul, come here! Never do that again, got it? Look down! You heard me, look down! Son of a bitch! Ma'am? I was passing. I thought I might be useful. In the garden or... Since you're alone. Thank you. I've servants for that. Jonas, you don't just turn up places on a whim. I thought that... Don't just think things. Besides, you've still to learn this, but... Women do the choosing. You're not in love, Jonas, you just desire me. It goes no further than that. Do you understand? But I'm glad you came back. Now I know. It was foolish. Something very foolish we'll forget very quickly. I like you very much. Go on. You'd better go. Look, my girl. Look at this land. It's magnificent. Easy, Caliph... It grieves me that Dédé wants nothing to do with it. I made a big mistake giving him that café. He's never been happier, believe me. The land's never interested him. He gets that from your poor mother. - You think I'm too hard on him? - A bit, yes. Good thing you're here. Seeing you beside me amongst all this, I know you belong here. Not on your own, of course. - Don't start that again. - Fabre's a fine boy. 1,500 acres near Mostaganem, wheat, vineyards... And cattle! 300 head! I love someone else. Jean-Christophe. - Let's go, Caliph. - Be careful. What can I say? She loves someone else. She loves someone else. Come on! What are you doing? Nothing. I saw a pair of storks. It was fabulous. - What's up? - Nothing! What am I to you? I don't understand. When you're all together, do you say, "There's Jonas the Arab"? Is that what I am? No! What are you on about? Leave me alone, please. I've never seen you like this. What do you know about me? What goes on inside? What do you know? Nothing! - You're crying? - I'm not! I need to be alone. - José! - What? Come and see. So?... Ugly, isn't it? That's what you think. Whatever I did you'd never like it. Go on! What is it you don't like? Tell me! - Is there nothing you like? - Listen... Your café's fantastic, my boy. - You really think so? - Really. I'm proud of you. And you can give your first anisette to me. Coming right up, Dad. To the San Francisco! His place looks great. - From here, anyway. - He did us proud. Can you believe the flag? How you doing? Isn't Isa with you? She's taking her time. You know her. Hey! It's been a while! Were you mad at us? The gentleman from Algiers has been snubbing us humble folk. Apart from you, of course. - Why me? - Won't you soon be a Rucillio? Not bad for a janitor's son. Cut the crap. It's not settled yet. - Are you jealous, Simon? - Of what? That Dédé will be his brother-in-law? God forbid! No. He's lucky though. I'm fed up. I spend all day with my dad, adding up numbers. - Accounting's no life! - Change jobs. You want to be a fashion designer. Be one. Fashion designer? You never told me. Isn't that a job for pansies? Stop it, Jean-Christophe. You want to be a designer? - Make us skirts! - Idiots. Let's grab a table. All right? Come and dance. Who'll be first to dance? Come on, let's go! To the San Francisco! Look at that idiot! So, what do you think? It's just like Dédé. Can you write a piece for the Oran Echo? I'll pay you. It doesn't work like that. José! It doesn't work like that? All right, get busy. There's work to do! He wears me out, I swear he does! You're like an old couple. Miss? Grenadine, please. What's up, Dédé? Look at her. Thanks. - I'm seeing things. - Me too. - Know her? - Never saw her before. - She's not local. - Those mysterious eyes... Simon! Stay with us. Come back down to Earth She's beautiful. I never saw a girl so pretty. Nobody's asked her to dance. - Who'll give it a try? - You. Go on. Are you crazy? I'm a lousy dancer. She's looking at you, Jonas. Look! I'll sacrifice myself then. To save our honour. - Go on. - I'm going! Hang on! What do you bet she says no? - What's he doing? - What got into him? It's very simple: I don't know who you are, or where you're from, but my name's Jonas... Don't laugh. There's a name for this. Love at first sight? I've never felt this before. I'll get down on my knees if you want. Go on then. Go on. - You want me to? - Yes. No! Ask me to dance instead. He's not asking her to dance? He's a different guy! It's the first time he's scored. And what a score. - Are you with friends? - Yes. I didn't know he could dance. I've been waiting for you. A very long time. So I finally came here. I don't understand. What don't you understand? Try and remember. Go back a bit... Have we met? Still got your little sailor-suit? Emilie. - I don't believe it! - Yes. I don't believe it. Well... we've got our anisette. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the icing on the cake, the highlight of the evening! All right, José. Let her rip! Beautiful, huh? - Where did she go? - I don't know. - You know her? - Why didn't you introduce us? Who is she? Her name's Emilie. - I knew her in Oran. We were 10. - So, not really. No, not really. Until she's somebody's she's everybody's. Where did she go? Here I am. Were the fireworks good? Darling... - She disappeared. - Who? Cinderella. Come on, let's dance. What's got into you all? Don't forget. Until she's somebody's... - Come down! - What? Don't argue, get down here! Coming. What's so exciting, Fatso? Get in! Hi, José. Dédé, start the car. What's going on? - I'll tell you on the way. - José, everyone pays. Everyone pays. - Where are you going? - Tell you later. - Where are you going? - Later! - Jonas. - What's up, Simon? - Where are you going? - What's got into you, Simon? - I know her address! - The San Francisco girl? - Yes! I know it. - Cool! - Until she's somebody's... - She's everybody's! There it is. - I know it. - Who lives there? Mrs. Cazenave. That's where she lives? Yes, she lives there. Hi, Jonas. Want to come up? - You can meet Mum. - Let's go. Get in the car. - Next to me. - Thanks. Wait, I'll scoot over. Krimo! Open up. Mum! Come and meet my friends. It's so hot, lemonade for everyone? - Are you boys having a nice holiday? - Yes! My daughter's on holiday too. She got an Arts degree in Toulouse. That's why we haven't seen you. I spared her French Guiana. Won't you offer your friends something to eat? Learn how to entertain! So, what do you all do? I'm a reporter. I'm starting out, at the Oran Echo. My dream is to be a writer. That's good. And you? I don't know yet. He wants to be a tailor. Not a tailor, you moron. I want to design dresses. My dream is to dress women. I met a designer in Paris, Pierre Balmain. - You know him? - We met at a dinner. He's so talented. Paris is the place for fashion. Yes, I know. Paris... And you, young man? Don't you work at the pharmacy? Yes. Do you like it? As a boy, he wanted to be a captain. You know him? I learned piano at his house in Oran, when I lived with Daddy. Isn't that a coincidence? His face when he knew it was me! I can imagine. I recognized you right away. May I help myself? - Go ahead. - I'm a bit hungry. I'll take one of these. My tummy's rumbling. There. All of that's Aïn-Beïda. - It was my grandfather's. - It's wonderful. It's huge. The olive trees must be 100 years old. That's a lot of acres. It goes from up there to here. And down to there. When can I see you? Tomorrow? Is that OK? 3pm at the library. We can walk and have a talk. Someone's hat. Yes, it's mine. - Thank you. - See you soon, I hope. - Come on up. - Bye, boys. Bye. Goodbye. Well personally, I find her a bit common. She lacks her mother's style. Without the dress and makeup... Knock it off, you hypocrites. Your tongues were on the floor! Listen to me! One day she'll be my wife! He's serious. Did she tell you that? - I just know. - Know who I'm going to marry? - No. - Grace Kelly. She told me this morning. Go on, laugh. You'll be crying one day. Where's Jonas? Did he go back inside? No, he's over there! What are you doing? What's he doing? He always has to be different. Let's go. He can walk home. - Drop me at my mum's? - Sure, sweetie. It's almost dinner time. - All you do is eat. You eat non-stop. - When I'm hungry, I eat. It's meatballs tonight. Fancy some meatballs? Why did you and Dad get divorced? You stopped loving him? So what? You don't have to love someone forever. What a sad attitude. Careful! That hurts. When I love someone, it'll be forever. Are you slightly in love? Yes. I'll finish it. Go to bed. Good night, Mum. I know where you're going! Come with me, I want to talk to you. Hello, Mrs. Dupuis. Hello, Fabrice. It's all ready. Perfect. Thanks. Guess what happened! - The Algiers Echo contacted me. - Really? They want to give me a job. Just think! A reporter in Algiers. No one else knows. What do you think? It's great. Yes, great. It means leaving here. - Do you have to go? - No. Is that the time? Yes. Have you made plans together? I don't know what you mean. I sinned against God and so did you. There's something worse. You can't sleep with mother and daughter at the same time. You can't... It's called incest. It would be horrible! Amoral! Incredibly obscene. Totally unacceptable. Jonas, please. I want to leave with an easy mind! Mrs. Cazenave, please... Or I'll tell her everything. You hear me? All that went on between us. I'll lose her, but so will you. Swear to me you'll never touch her. Swear, Jonas. Please! In the name of what happened. Please... Swear... I swear. - Will you wait for me? - Sure. - Hello. - Miss... Is Jonas here? No, he went out a while ago. OK, thank you. Wait a minute... Aren't you...? Emilie, yes. I'm so happy to see you again. You're so beautiful. - Are you visiting? - No, I live here now. Jonas didn't tell me. Hi, Jonas. What are you doing? I'm with Emilie. Are you OK? You look weird. No, I'm fine. Hey, kids! Stop fighting. Keep in time, Emilie. Careful... You can't play football. It's a man's game. Why didn't you come? - I was busy. - Liar. You were at home. I saw you. Why are you avoiding me? - You're having fun with the others. - I'm not. They keep hanging around me. I want to be alone with you. There's no alone here. Get used to it. What did I do to you, Jonas? Isn't she lovely? You're nuts. You're turning down your dream job at the Algiers Echo? Can't you see I'm in love? I can't leave her now. It's serious then. You're so lucky! But not at football! Got you, buddy! - It's the return match! - See? Hurry up! Football's serious. - Put some oil on me? - Sure. Aren't we playing? Go on, Jonas. - Does he always look so bored? - No. He's in a good mood today. - He's usually worse. - I'm not to blame then. "Beware the silent dog and the quiet man" A Spanish proverb. Now it's a poetry club! Come on, your turn. Here comes Tarzan. I beat my record! Why are you moping? We're young in the best country in the world! Who can beat us? - Is the water warm? - See for yourself. Let's go. Shall I come with you? Sure she's your girl? They seem a bit... I mean, look at them. Lucky Isabelle's in Oran. She'd scratch his eyes out! Poor Isabelle. I'm off. I'm sick of the sun. It's a hot one today. You look stunning. I learned how to play with shadows. You've been back 2 months. I hoped to run into you. You know nobody runs into me. Juan. We see a lot of your daughter. She's quite a beauty... She's just like you. No, not really. She's the opposite of me. You want to sell Aïn-Beïda? Only the land. Not the house. You came to make an offer? I came to ask you not to sell. Why not? Your family was one of the first to settle here. Look... This is your home. Not really... I always felt stifled here. That why I left. But you came back. It's not what you think. I'm just passing through. Like it or not, your roots are here, Claire. You make me laugh with your roots. You're like trees. You don't budge. You're absolutely convinced that nothing will ever change. But look around you! The world's changing. If that's your view, you should sell. I'll buy Aïn-Beïda. Name a price. Of course you'll buy it. - It's what you came for. - Not just that. I want this land to stay with us, whatever happens. Put our lawyers in touch. We'll sign whenever you like. Aïn-Beïda will be yours. Yes, a pound, please. The red ones, OK? Sure, the red ones. Thank you. You're lucky, going to Algiers. My student days were the best of my life. You might meet someone. Who knows? Who knows... Tell me, how did you and Mohamed meet? What kind of a question is that? All this time, you've never told me. There aren't many couples like you. There's not much to say. We met at university. I was in my first year, he was in his last. We hit it off. That was that. And that's all? No, that's not all. Know what it's like for a Catholic to love a Muslim? Our families turned their backs on us. But we loved each other and still do. And everything is fine. Love wins out. Always. What about this hat? It's pretty. Your turn! I'll do it, Dad. Do what? Marry the Fabre boy. You'll do nothing so stupid. You're not marrying that idiot on the rebound. I forbid you to do it, do you hear? What if I want to? Remember when you got sad as a little girl? We'd go out and get you a big cake. It never failed. You'd be smiling again. I'm too old for that. Isabelle... Out of my way! - What's up with him? - Dédé! Dédé's pretty drunk. He's got to stop drinking. Darling... Hey, Emilie... Give that back! "When love plays dirty tricks, it proves you don't deserve it." Give me that! "That summer was..." Proud of yourself? Having fun? I think it's wonderful. - I don't get it. - Don't you? Not with this! Not with this, Simon. Screw you! Screw all of you! What's eating him? Too much sun. Jonas! Come quickly. It's carnival today. Djelloul got a real beating. There he is. - Dédé did this? - Yes! He got drunk and beat me up. If that bastard comes back, I'll kill him! I want to go home. Wait... I'll take you. The keys! Give them to me. Shit! Be careful, OK? He's a cab driver now? Jonas, where are you going? Stop here! Look. That's where I live. That's our place in this country. Take a look. Even God has abandoned us. Why say that? Because it's true. Do me a favour and take this. I'll repay you some day. Thank you, brother. Go back to your friends. But remember your name's Younès. You're an Arab like us. The French-Vietnamese in Indochina have launched an offensive. Operation JURA's objective was to clear... The man himself! Howdy. - Is it any good? - Not bad. I saw it in Oran. - How are you? - Fine. - Any news of Djelloul? - None. I went to his shack, he's not interested. The idiot's changed. You miss your Djelloul? Yes, I miss him. Come on, honey. Two, please. Where's Fabrice? Hey, look. Hi. Evening, gentlemen. Evening. What's pissing them off? Come on. She's a prick teaser! Haven't you heard? He wants to marry her. - He's lost his mind. - What about Isabelle? He dropped her. The poor kid can't get over it. Emilie surprised me. She seemed like a nice girl. - Has it started? - Yes, we waited for you. - Coming? - Right away. What are you playing at? I'm not playing. You are. Because I'm unhappy. Can't you see that? We have to go in. Don't you know I love you? I loved you from the start. When I saw you I thought my heart would burst. I know you feel the same. Here! Feel my heart beating for you? Can you feel it? - You bastard! - You've got it wrong. I have? You're groping her and I've got it wrong! - Jean-Christophe! - Let go of me! You both make me sick! Especially you, you dirty bastard! "Friends forever". Remember? Remember? You screwed me over! Screwed me over! What an idiot! Idiot! She wants you, asshole! She'll stop at nothing! You knew all along! Stop it! Jean-Christophe! Let go of me! Stay with your dirty Arab! You shitbag. Are you all right? Good morning, Jonas. How are you? Fine, Mrs. Lopez. I'm going back to Algiers. Well, have a good trip. Sure you want to leave now? There's two weeks holiday left. I've too much work. I need a new room. Maybe cousin Fernande's found you a room by the main post office. Be sure not to write, OK? Send no news... As usual. He's young, why should he write. Let him be. Let him finish studying. I'm so proud of him. - I wanted to say... - Not a word of thanks. You're our son. We should thank you for all you've given us. I put 20,000 francs in your case. Under your socks. A dog always buries its bone. Go now. Fabrice. - Well? - Nowhere. Jean-Christophe's gone. Nothing to do with me. I didn't want to hurt him, It was to make you jealous, see? I went to see his parents. He didn't even leave a note. His poor mother's really upset. His poor mother. He drank himself stupid here until 3am. Right? Until 3am. Can't Isabelle find him? What a mess. Look! What's he doing with her? I've lost everything now you're leaving. It's better this way. What are you doing? Leaving already? All aboard! It'll be dull without you. There they are! Jean-Christophe's joined up. He sails for Saigon tomorrow. What? Is he insane? There's a war going on! Anything happens, you're to blame. And you too! Isabelle. Forgive me. I didn't want that. You'll miss the bus. See you in 2 weeks. So long, brother. All aboard! I left Rio behind like childhood. I had to distance myself, see different skies and horizons. I felt alone in Algiers. I was bored. My friends had dispersed and sadness engulfed me every time I thought of Emilie. ...by sweeping the device with an inert gas, like nitrogen. In this case, the inert gas is introduced by water from a bromine vial, so a sodium chloride tube isn't needed. That's all for today, thank you for listening. See you next week. Dear Jonas, I once said that if you left you didn't love me. Today, a year after your departure, I know it isn't true. You left for Algiers because you love me, I'm sure of it. That's what hurts most... I sat an exam yesterday and I feel good about my degree. You asked if I'd come back to Rio Salado. These 4 years in Algiers have made me want other things. I've been offered a job next year in a big pharmacy in town. I haven't decided yet, but I'm thinking of staying here. I met a girl at the paper. She's called Hélène. She's the love of my life. We visited Tipaza with Jonas. I read a page from Camus. "In spring, the gods inhabit Tipaza and talk in the sun and smell of wormwood. The silver-plated sea..." Hélène was in tears. After that, how can I not marry her? "Flower-covered ruins, light gushing on piles of stones..." Jonas, my shop's opening soon. I'm on cloud nine. Nobody would give me a chance. Emilie's mother helped me. I'll never forget it. The Simon Benyamin label will make it to Paris. What do you think? I'll be dressing women, until I undress one some day! It's... Later, we'll have to... Things are bad here. Indochina's done for. The Viets are everywhere. I lost 3 buddies in an ambush yesterday. I don't know how I made it out. I think of you every day and long to see you again. How sorry I am for what happened. My love, your uncle cried when we got the good news. We're so proud of you. Here, Mrs. Atlan. That's 260 francs. Knowing you can run this place is a huge relief to him. And me, too. We're getting old. Excuse me. Don't stay in Algiers too long. We're waiting for you. All right, Mahi? I'm fine. Telegram, Mr. Mahieddine. - Good day. - Thank you. Rio Salado, please. What happened? He got angry reading the paper and... Fell out of the chair. - Hi, François. - Hello. - How was the ball? - A great Bastille Day. Hello, Emilie. I knew you were back. You haven't changed. How's your uncle? He's in a coma. I'm sorry. - I hear you got your degree. - Yes. I'm a pharmacist now. You took over from Mrs. Dupuis? Yes, since she retired. How are things here? Still the same. You know Simon's in business with my mother? He said he sold two dresses to the mayor of Algiers' wife. - It was in the paper. - Fabrice wrote the article. He really laid it on. He's getting married too. I've heard of this. Any good? It's wonderful. It's about a man everyone loves who's unable to love. Take it. - Is that how you see me? - I'm 24, Jonas, I can't go on like this. Easy now. Easy does it. Turn, Mrs. Cazenave. I love the way it hangs. I hear your friend Jonas is back. He had to leave Algiers on account of his sick uncle. There... - A little bit shorter? - Really? Come here. Look at this wonderful dress. It's... Gorgeous. - It's beautiful. - Thanks. You know the pharmacist's son is back? Yes. - Simon... - Yes? Can't you sew another face on my girl? I'm tired of this sad one. That's enough! Would you like to stay for dinner tonight? I'd love to. Saïda, set another place. I'm going to lose the love of my life. All because I made a promise to her mother. What can I do to keep her? I gave my word. I'm unable to love anyone. That's the truth. What can I do? Help me... Simon. What brings you here? Don't you know? Jean-Christophe's back. Let's go. - He won't want to see me. - That's ancient history. Isabelle's arranged it all. We can't let her down. Come on. You can't stay, girls. It's a family lunch. Jean-Charles, see them out. You're exaggerating. It's plain to see, Mr. Rucillio! The atmosphere in Algiers is just like Saigon. If you came back to tell us that, don't bother. Isn't it true? Indochina was lost by those fools. Mendès France and his cronies gave up everything! They won't give up Algeria. It's French. Congratulations on your stripes. Cheers! - Uniform suits him. - Yes. Let's eat. Emilie, Isabelle... Emilie's there. I'll sit here. Come on. Sorry we're late. It's fine, we just sat down. Why is he here? Did you have to invite him? Wait, Jean-Christophe. Please, listen. I've always kept my word. I never betrayed anyone. You've lost your memory, I haven't. I've forgiven her, but not you. We've nothing to say. Friends forever? My ass! Come my boy. You have a place among us. - Thank you. - Here... Thank you, one and all. I'm so glad to have you gathered here today. Nothing could make me happier than to see you... in this big house that's so empty since my poor Maria died. And thanks to Isabelle, who organized this wonderful surprise. There's another surprise. Jean-Christophe has something to say. Mr. Rucillio, you know how I respect you, and you know my feelings towards your daughter. While I was in Indochina, Isabelle and I wrote. Now, we're sure of one other. Mr. Rucillio... - I'd like to ask for her hand. - You're kidding! - Dad! This is serious! - I know, but... An officer in the family's something. Isn't it? Champagne! This needs celebrating. Let's drink to it. Lieutenant, have a glass. I give her to you willingly. Be happy, my children! To Isabelle and my son-in-law and the heir you'll give me. If it's up to him... It's not my fault! I'm too popular with the ladies. I've something to say, too. You're getting married? Yes, Dédé, I'm getting married. To me. We decided a week ago. I didn't think we were telling them yet. Her mother agreed. We'll marry before Christmas. Congratulations, Simon! Thank you. The best man's a problem. Between Fabrice, absent today, Jean-Christophe and Jonas... You'll have to draw straws. It's an honour, Simon, but I won't be here. I'm posted to Istres. Fabrice can take my place. Don't be mad at me. No, I understand, but... You've no excuse. You're right, I've no excuse. Thanks. I know she doesn't love me. I'll try to make her happy. - I'm sure you will. - Thank you. Drink to love, my children. To love! We must go before it gets dark. Go! May God be with you! Don't worry, we'll take care of him. Algeria's our country. Thank you! Let's go! Now! The White Horse I came to tell you why I'm marrying Simon. It's your decision. I know. It's to get you out of my life. If that's a good reason. Do you leave me a choice? Just say the word, I'll cancel the wedding. I'll cancel everything. You've no right. No right? What are you saying? Sacrificing our love is a crime. Please, Jonas, don't leave me. Don't leave me, please. Emilie, we've talked about this. Talked, yes. I talked. You didn't. You've never talked. Wait! Is it because I'm French? Is that the real reason? Answer me! Who are you asking? Younès... - Or Jonas? - That's it! It's that. I can't explain. Explain what? What can't you explain? You're a monster! The worst thing that ever happened to me! God damn you, Jonas! I'll never forgive you! God damn you! All right! Nobody move! - Long live the bride! - Congratulations! Long live the bride! Well done, Simon! Bravo! - Bravo, Simon! - Thank you, friends. Long live the newlyweds! I'll be back. Tell them I'm coming. Don't say you're not coming. I'm sorry, Simon. My uncle's unwell. It's the best day of my life. Didn't I tell you? You told me all right. Well, I did it! Simon, come on! We're leaving. I'm coming! We'll live at her place. It wasn't my decision, but... That's how it is. It'll be a hell of a party. You'll come? Even if it's late. I'll be waiting. I'm coming! I'm hungry, too! - What's he doing? - He'll join us later. Hello? Yes... When? I'm coming. Mr. Mahieddine! This can't be happening! Mahi! When did you notice? An hour ago. I went in to change his drip... We rang right away. Look for him, please! Look for him... Is that you, Younès? Are you all right? Of course I'm all right. Seen the moon? We're the only country with nights like this. Will you get out? Come! She spoke to me. - Who? - Lala Fatma. Your great, great aunt. You know what she said? She said, "Come and visit me. "Come and see me". We'll go and visit her grave. It's on the top of a hill... OK. It's time to go back now. Marry a woman, Younès. Love her more than necessary. As if it's the only thing you know how to do in life. And remember, if a woman gives you her love... You'll be able to touch all the stars. Leave me now. I'm going to sit down... Wait! - I'm here. - I'm going to sleep a bit... My uncle didn't see his country rise up in arms. He died on the eve of November 1, 1954, the War of Independence. A handful of men took action. A midnight sharp the fuse was lit. It would set Algeria on fire. "He was scared! Run fast! "We have to help him! "Help, help me, quick, quick! "They followed Champlèze..." Thank you. France 7, broadcasting from Algeria. General Salan, the government's chief representative... What? - What's that for? - They're attacking people. They killed the family in the farm next door. Am I a gangster? Get them out! They're dangerous. You're crazy! Well children, I'm going. - I won't be breathing down your necks. - Mum... Only Michel puts up with me now. I'll go with you. Thank you, Simon, Krimo will do it. Look after your son. I took your drawings. Even last year's. - I'll call when I've news. - Thanks, Claire. - He'd be lost without you. - I know. We're so different. OK, Krimo, let's go. Have a safe trip! Hello, Jonas. Hello. I'm catching the boat. I need some Nautamine. I'm going to Paris. - Anything else? - Yes. I wanted to thank you, Jonas. You kept your word. How much do I owe you? Nothing. If she'd chosen you, I'd have accepted it. I don't know what you mean. Yes you do. I hurt you badly. I'm sorry. Forgive me if you can. Move it! Close up the convoy! There... More glasses. Put them there. This morning I went to my vineyard. The sun had just risen. Magnificent! I thought, "If we leave, they'll pull it all up". How sad! My God, how sad. This is the end, René. It's the end. "Miss Grape Harvest 1961" candidates to the town hall. I repeat, the town hall. - I'm getting up there! - No. Well done, Simon! Let's have fun! It's all that's left. I doubt if there's much fun in Algiers these days. Let's get a drink. - Well? - I'll take care of that bastard. - Here... - Thanks. I wanted to say, some people don't like what you write. What are they saying? I'm on the Fellagha's side? I'm on no one's side. I just tell the truth... There are some crazy people around. Be careful. We have to face up to it. Yesterday's Algeria has gone. Perhaps, but watch out. Hey, you! How dare you show your traitor's face! We got shafted. - But we're striking back. - What do you mean? The last card is reconciliation or else we're screwed. You're screwed! You sold out to the FLN like all your buddies in Paris. France Observer and the rest. Let me tell you, this is our country and we'll never leave it! You think I want to leave? That I want to go? My son was born here. So was I, like you, like all of us. We have to see things differently. Understand! It's over. Your OAS won't save us. Fuck you and your stupid ideas. Drop your pants. Go on, drop 'em! All right? You know I love you? Get down here! He's losing blood. Get the bullet out. I'm not a doctor! He's our leader! Understand? He can't die. What's going on? Save him or she dies! - Let my mother go! - That's enough, Djelloul! Let me do it! I'm better than you with a needle and thread. Now get out! Keep those machine guns away from me. Toufik, stay here! Madeleine, your son stays with me. Everyone out! Younès, you'll have to choose a side one day. Your brothers call you traitor. I should kill you, but I won't. Gently, please. He's lost a lot of blood. Make some medicine for next week and leave it by that tree. Remember how we treat squealers! Get out of here. - Stop here please! - Where? Keep moving! Go on! Captain, that's him! Stop right there! Get out! I'm a pharmacist! I live here! Hands on your head! It's him! We saw him help the Fellagha! - You bastard! - Take him away! Move it! Take a good look at me! You coward! - You're a traitor. - Move it! Simon, the army arrested Jonas! - Do something! - I'm sure he's not involved. What if they don't believe him? If I could help, I wouldn't wait for you ask! I know you love him. I've known all along. I live with it inside of me! Don't ask too much of me. I'm begging you. You're in a real mess. Aiding the enemy. You know the cost of that? Sit down. You're very lucky, young man. Mr. Rucillio says you spent last night at his home playing Ronda, right? Right. Do you play Ronda, Colonel? Not at all. With such a witness, I've no choice but to let you go. Thank you, Colonel. Our officers still have a sense of duty. And a sense of humour. Colonel... You're lucky, but I'm watching you. Got it? Get out! Look, Jonas. When my great grandfather came here from Andalusia, there was nothing, you hear? Nothing. This country owes us everything. It was a pitiful rock, we made a Garden of Eden. You know why this land's generous? It knows we love it. What are your Fellagha good for? Burning houses and killing poor farmers. If we go, in 20 years Algeria will have no wheat or vineyards left. Nothing! You hear me? Just rocks. Those rocks aren't yours. A long time ago, Mr. Rucillio, before your great grandfather came, a man stood there. He didn't have anything. But he was happy. Until the day he saw trouble coming. Trouble? What trouble? This land isn't yours. It's that shepherd's. You refuse to see it, but he'll win. You can count on it. We must have made mistakes. But who doesn't? I got my rifle out to protect my family and I hate blood. What's wrong? Does it mean me, too? You too what? I'm French, after all. From what we hear... Nobody will ever touch you, you hear? Nobody! You were born here, it's your country! You're staying! Doesn't it belong to those who are leaving, too? What's that over there? I don't know. It's in the direction of... Don't touch him! Stay there, darling. Don't touch him. Your friends cut his throat. I shot at them. I'm sure I hit one. Treat them again and I'll kill you. Throw him out, Krimo! I don't want to see him again! Get out! Leave us alone! Get out! Get out of here! Beat it! Simon Shimoran Benyamin, rest in peace. May God be with you and your memory with us forever. We'll read the Kaddish. You're not going in! Get it? Her husband's body's still warm and you want to sleep with her! Screwing her mother wasn't enough? Get out! Algerian Algeria was born in tears and blood. French Algeria breathed its last. After 7 years of war and horror, madmen were still killing each other and widening the rift of ruin. - What are you doing? - What Dad's doing at the farm. Tomorrow it'll be over for us. We'll never have existed. The only thing left will be our cemeteries. Dédé, that's enough! Who thought it would end like this? Come on! Come on, dammit! Goodbye, Jonas. Rio Salado, July 1962 - Are you Younès Mahieddine? - Yes, why? Follow us. Don't be afraid. We're here. Good to see you, brother. So the San Francisco's gone? Bring him here! A good day for settling scores, right? I moved heaven and earth to save him, for you. You defended your Algeria in the worst way! Beat it! You're free. Isabelle's waiting. I asked nothing of you! I'm here. Isn't that the main thing? Go on. Leave this country for ever! Thank you, Djelloul. Congratulations, brother! My love... I thought I'd never see you again. Thank you. Tell him we'll always be friends. Friends forever. - Goodbye, Jonas. - One minute. What about Emilie... No. Please, I gave my word. I've looked everywhere. It's been weeks. Help me. Tell me where she is. You two are pure madness. Oran. 38 rue Alsace-Lorraine. Unless she's gone already. Thanks, Isabelle. I must go to Oran. You're crazy. It's a madhouse. The streets are dangerous, we don't control them all. All right, but be careful. Take him to Oran. God be with you. Thank you. Watch out, darling. Are you coming? Go ahead, Madam. Your turn. Stop! - This area's under French protection. - We've a pass. - Are you coming with us? - Stay here. I'll protect you. You and your son. Why now? I could never find the right words. I hate myself so much for it. I'll give you everything. Everything. This country took everything from me. Everything. It's over, Jonas. What's over? Something that never really began. Come on, Let's go, darling. Sergeant, close it up. Come here, Michel. So many years had passed, but I was still just as sad. She felt so close for so long. As if I'd only have to lift a curtain or open a door to find her again. She was all I thought about for a long time. Her eyes were my horizon. She was the fate I didn't want to choose by letting her go. I wrote to her all the time. My letters were never answered. Until the day her son called me... Flight Aigle-Azur 8290 from Oran arriving at concourse 1, gate A. - Michel... - Yes. Everyone takes me for my father. For a second I thought it was him. I'm glad to meet you finally. Mum told me so much about you. I'm sorry I couldn't come before on account of the visa. Let's go. They're all waiting for you. Who? All your friends from Algeria. They're at Dédé's in Bandol. He made paella. - They all came? - They've been here 2 days. Fabrice, Dédé, Hélène, Isabelle... Even Krimo came. They want to see you. It's been so long. - What about Jean-Christophe? - No... He's my godfather. I called but it was no good. Are you all right? I'm fine. I forgot to take my pills this morning. You have to be careful at my age. It's my heart. I'll be all right. I'll put on the air conditioning. Tell them I couldn't make it. You're kidding! They're so happy... Some other time, perhaps. I'd rather go straight there. Can you take me? Suit yourself. Dédé's paella...! It happened so quickly. She went in a matter of months. Here... This is for you. She asked me to give it to you. Dear Younès, I saw you in Marseille when you were afraid to come over. I looked out for you from then on, but you never came back. A wave would have changed everything, but that's how you are. Fate, as we'd say. We must accept things. How I regret the things I reproached you for. Maybe that's why I couldn't open the letters you sent me over the years. Some silences shouldn't be disturbed. Forgive me as I have forgiven you. You were my one and only love. Emilie. I love you, Emilie. I love you... So the Arab's in France and doesn't visit his friends? Jean-Christophe! My God! Don't look at me like that. You've changed too. - I didn't think you'd come. - Well, here I am. Friends forever? Tell me about Rio Salado. Have they forgiven me there? Have you forgiven me? I'm too old, Jonas. I can no longer afford to hold a grudge. Come and see me sometime. I live alone, - I've a room for you. - No thanks! - It's your country, too. - No. Not any more. They forced us to leave. Our suitcases are full of ghosts. I haven't forgotten anything. Algeria sticks to my skin, but I'd rather remember it as it was. I'll never go back. If you change your mind, you'll always be welcome. Go in peace. Your letter.
