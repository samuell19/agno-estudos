What's in the bag? I can't say. Pull yourself together! Be quiet! Where's the package? Where is it? Tell us now or die a traitor! Fuck you! You'll never find it. Check the back. See if anyone is still alive. Find them right now! Let's go! Hey! Listen up... If we can't find it, we are dead. Hurry up! Go to the right. Over there! Where is it? Kinji? Are you okay? Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. It's just... What's going on? Where have you been? Please, just sit down. There's something I need to tell you. You're worrying me. What's going on? Sakura, please just listen to me. We have to leave Tokyo. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean for this to happen. - When? - Tonight. I'll explain more after we've left. You just have to trust me. Of course I trust you. But go where? You mean to another house or city? No. We have to leave Japan and move to London. We have to leave now. - London? But that's... - l know, but we don't have another choice. - Has it got something to do with your work? - I can't say anymore here. We have to leave right away. Okay, I trust you. I'll sort the kids out and pack everything. I hope you've got a plan for us Kinji. We can't let anything happen to them. Of course I do, don't worry. Everything will be fine. Nothing will happen to any of them. I promise. Okay. Timmy, the food's ready. Okay, got it. We've got three more chicken teriyakis for table eight and a shrimp sushi platter for table four. Okay Mio, coming right up. Everything all right out there? Yeah, everything's fine. I think we have to start turning people away soon though, the restaurant's pretty packed at the moment. Oh no no no, Mio, we never turn away customers. We always find space for them, no matter what. Oh course father, we'll make sure everyone has a table, don't worry. Great. Focus! No mistakes today. - Hi, thanks again. - Hello. Hi Preena, thank you so much for your help. No worries. How was he? He was a really good boy, yeah. Oh thank you, we'll see you next week. Yes, bye. Kinji. Jumpei's sleeping. Good night, Junpei. Sweet dreams. Should really cut down on those, Frank, before I have to start cooking for your kitchen, too. How you doing, Kinji? I'm good, thanks. Busy day? Oh yeah, you could say that. Got an earful from my staff so I came down here for an escape. Ah, giving you a hard time again? Bet your ass they are. They always want a raise man, I mean come on. This is England, the land of cheap and cheerful, that's why we came here, right? Anyway how are you doing? Looks like you're killing it, man, good for you. I, I can't complain, business is good. I do work them hard though. And so you should. I am thinking of expanding into catering, but, Sakura's not sure I'm ready for it yet. Why not, that's a great idea man. Want me to talk to her? Maybe she'll buy the American bullshit, greed is good. Great seeing you, Frank. You too, man. Go easy on your staff. Come on. I gotta get going but, I'll see you soon. Hey, not if I see you first. Karate! See you later man. Convince her. Catering's a good idea. And this is the edimame, your favorite, I assume. And your drink's not here, is it? I'll get it for you right now. - How was everything? - The food was great. - Please send my compliments to the chef. - Thank you so much. How long have you had the restaurand for, may I ask? Must be 3 years now! Time certainly does fly. Well you've certainly achieved a lot in 3 years. Thank you. We're still growing! My husband has a lot of ideas. I can imagine. That must be the chef? Kinji. This gentleman was just paying you a very nice compliment. Thank you so much. My name is Kinji. - Yasuyuki. - It's a pleasure to have you here. I've been trying to find a good Japanese restaurant in London! I see. You are welcome back anytime, Yasuyuki. I will definitely be back. Thank you. Well, we are closing the kitchen soon. It was nice to meet you, Yasuyuki. - Yes. Thank you. - Excuse me. - Lovely to meet you. - And you. Prawns, prawns, prawns... Carrot... Boss, join us! Okay! - What's going on in here!? - Let's dance, Mio! Prawns, prawns, prawns... Sorry, boss. I'm so sorry. So just send everything to me, okay. I gotta go, I gotta go, bye. Jinpei! - Daddy! - Having fun? I made a new friend today. Oh? He's called Masaki. Masaki, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Can we go play longer? I'm sorry, Jumpei, but I gotta get back to the restaurant. Please? Tomorrow, I promise. - Kinji. Good to see you. - Yasuyuki. I didn't know you had a son at the same school? Yes, he started a few weeks ago. What a coincidence! - It's a great school. He's in safe hands. - Yes, so I've heard. Can we go play? Just for a minute, yeah. Okay. You should stop by the restaurant again. Bring your wife or a friend next time. My wife is out of town at the moment... but I may stop by again. Thank you for the offer. You're welcome. We also have a new menu. New menu? That sounds very tempting. - Okay, I'll see you tonight. - Great! See you later, Yasuyuki. Thank you. See you later. Jumpei, we do need to go. Masaki, nice to meet you. Bye. See you. He seems nice. Well hello again! - Great to see you back so soon. - Thank you, it's nice to be back. Kinji told me about the new menu. I would love to try it! Yes, it's a little different to what you might expect. Is that right? Looking forward to it. Mio, Mio! Hello! Mio, take Yasuyuki to a table. - This way, please. - Sure. Enjoy! Here we go, best table in the house. - Thank you, that's very kind. - And here is a menu for you. Boo! Hi, can I help? A table for three, in the back. Would you be eating or just drinking? Depends how good is the food. Where is your husband? My husband? Your husband. I imagine he is the boss. Where is the boss? Well, we both own the restaurant, so we're both in charge. You are a woman, your husband is the boss. Where is he? He's busy in the kitchen at the moment. Very smart, he's the chef too, very good. Tell him we will wait for him there when he's finished. We close at 11:00 PM. We will wait. And bring a bottle of vodka for our palette. - Kinji. - What's wrong? Some strange men just walked into the restaurant. They want to talk to you. Why do they want to talk to me? What do you mean? They said they wanted to talk to the boss and will wait until we're finished. Who are they? What do they want? I have no idea who they are. Don't worry, I'll talk to them. I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding... and they have the wrong place. It doesn't look like it! They're drinking vodka. Don't worry, Sakura, everything will be okay. Let's finish the orders first. As soon as we are done, take Mio home. I will close up the restaurant. Okay? Okay. Just make sure they leave and don't come back. - They are scaring our customers away. - Understood. Everything okay? Yeah? Ah, you must be the boss. Please sit, we've been waiting for you. My wife says you wanted to talk to me, how can I help? Yes and you have a, a very charming wife, but to business. Business? Yes, you have a business, and now your business is my business. I'm sorry, I don't follow. How long have you had this place? Three years. Three years, long time. It's time you start to pay your fees. Fees? Yes, your fees, for having a restaurant in London. Everybody in this town pays someone, and that someone is me. I'm sorry, I still don't follow. This is our restaurant, we have no debts, there's no one we need... You have a debt now! That debt belongs to me. Now let me explain how it's going to work. The last Friday of every month, you will give us 20% of what you make. Your turnover, not your profit. We will check your books, we will check your tills, so you can hide nothing from us. I'm sorry, but that's never gonna happen. The money we make here is our hard earned money. And now some of that hard earned money is mine! It's very simple, if you don't pay we will hurt your family. And we will hurt you. Just leave my family alone. I will pay you what you want. Good. Finally, we are coming to an understanding. I'm starting to like this man. Now remember, the last Friday of every month, you will have the money ready, yes? Good. We are done. Have you done your homework? Yeah, but I haven't read the book so I might get told off. You haven't read it? I'm sure you'll be fine. Dad. Hm? Who were those men at the restaurant last night? Who's that? You know who I mean. Oh those guys. They were nobody, don't worry. Just some people who wanted to make themselves known in the area. Big cities sometimes attract strange people. Thank you mommy. Can I stop? Of course, Jumpei. They were more than strange, dad. The way they were looking at people. Mio, your father have dealt with it. Don't worry about them. Anyway, what have you got on at college, today? Oh just preparing for the exams, nothing crazy. Well that sounds important. Anything you want us to help you with? No mom, I'm fine, but thanks. Oh, I gotta go. I'll see you both at the restaurant later? Bye. Bye, dad. Kinji. Hm? Mio said goodbye. Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'll see you tonight. Good luck at school. Oh, it's called college now, dad. - Bye... - Bye! Kinji, I really do hope they won't be coming back. Please tell me you have dealt with them. Of course. No, they just wanted to make themselves known. Anyway, you know me, I have a plan. I always have a plan. Do they have anything to do with Doku? No. No no, of course not. Why would you say that? That's long in the past. Actually, thinking of that, I do need to go. Right... I'm leaving. Junpei, be a good boy. See you at the restaurant. I need to do a few things before we open. - Okay. See you later. - Bye bye. Excuse me, is Frank around? Sleep right here. Sorry, is Frank here? He's probably out back, man. Out, there? He's out the back. Okay. Thanks. Frank? Kinji, um. Uh what do you, what, how'd you find me? What are you doing here? Your staff told me. Where are your customers? Um, thank you Brittany, um you're doing very well. We'll take care of that next week, all right. Um, my customers are, um, okay business isn't doing that well. I don't think your staff are helping. Yeah, I mean tell me about it. It's all going to shit. Listen, can we talk somewhere? Yeah sure. Oh, just, by the way that, that, wasn't what it looked like. That was just a staff thing. Yeah, sure. Okay. Hey guys, listen up. I want you to go for lunch, all right. When you come back I want you scrubbing tables or trying to get customers in here. Or you're both fucking fired, comprende? Let's go, let's go! Well, this is obviously where I'm doing something wrong, Kinji. I mean, for a while we had it really good there. Then the bloody Russians showed up and all our customers went away. Whoa, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Aw geez, they haven't called you already, have they? Oh shit man, you're screwed. Well how do they get away with it? I mean, what do they want? Okay look. In London there's always somebody calling the shots behind the scenes. Could be the English, the Irish, Russians, whatever. It's always one of them. When they smell a business that's doing well, that's when they call on you. It's usually two or three years in. Wait, did they do this to you? Yup. And what happened, did you pay them? You bet your ass I did. I mean not right away, but eventually. 'Cause you don't pay them, they make your life a living hell. Not to mention what they do to your restaurant. What do you mean? Those burns up there, yeah that was them. And after they torched the place they threatened my family and that's when I knew I had to pay. Which I did for six months or so, while we still had customers. Then all the sudden, customers went away and the business turned upside down and the Russians haven't been back since, which, maybe it's a blessing. So what are you saying, I, I just turn away my customers and I hope that they go away. No Kinji, that's not. Okay, what I'm saying is don't fight it. Okay just, just play ball. Do what they ask and if you're lucky you'll get by. I need to find out who they are. Who do they work for? Jesus Christ, Kinji, just don't look into this all right? Stay out of it, okay? The deeper you dig, the nastier it gets, trust me. They all answer to someone who runs things from underground. I don't know his name, but they all answer to him. The Italians, the Irish, the Russians, everybody. He's bad news, Kinji. Think about your family, don't do something stupid. No. No, I have to do something. I can't let them do this to me or my. Kinji you could get. Just be patient Frank. I'm gonna fix this, for both of us. Yasuyuki! You're early! - The restaurant isn't open yet... - No problem, Kinji. I was just passing by and thought I would come to see you. Sorry to keep you waiting. - Here we go. - Thank you. How are things with you? They are well, thank you. Masaki is really enjoying his new school. That's great to hear. Maybe we can get our sons together again soon? I'm sure Masaki would like that. What about you? How's business going? The restaurant seems to be doing very well. Yes, it's going surprisingly well, thank you. But... But? Has something happened? I'm sure it's nothing, but... we had some trouble with a few Russian men. Yes, I saw them come in. What did they want? Oh it's nothing really. I know it's not my business, but please let me know if there's anything I can help with. When the Russians came, they must have wanted something? It was nothing really. I understand how important this restaurant is to you. I represent many businesses. So I know how the Russians operate in London. I see. You're a lawyer? Yes, I am. I see. I guess I'm still learning how things operate in London. Would you be willing to help me in some way with the restaurant? Of course. You can reach me anytime... and tell me how you think I can help. Thank you. I appreciate that. But, not here. - My wife would start to worry if she heard us talk. - That's okay. Just let me know where and when you want to talk. I'll be there. My family means everything. Family is important. You must always protect them first. Thank you. I must get back to preparing for lunch. You are welcome to stay as long as you need. The way things work around here, is when I ask for something, I get it. Yeah? So when I ask for this very, very important information, and you tell me it's gonna be difficult, makes me wonder how fucking useless you really are, huh? I don't want to hear any of this, it's gonna be difficult, bullshit, just get it done. I wanna hear solutions, not fucking problems. Yeah? Or do I need to find someone else to do the job, huh? - No. - No. Not at all Mr Dyer, we're just talking about the highest levels of government security and data. It, it's highly classified. It will take us just a bit more time to obtain. I'm expecting more... Hang on there. Time? You want more fucking time? He wants more time. Fucking time? Time, is something you don't have my son, yeah! Time, is always against us. So if there's one thing in this beautifully fucked up world you don't have, it's time. Now do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth? Or am I speaking double fucking Dutch? Huh? Yes, yes Mr Dyer. We understand completely. Good. Now we're getting somewhere. We'll have everything to you by tomorrow. I want it by the end of tomorrow. And if I don't have it by then, let's just say your time's up. Now get the fuck out of my club! Set up a meet with the Russians. Sure boss, where do you want it? Where the fuck do you think? Here, you idiot. No no, my love. Sakura, Sakura, You don't have to worry anymore. No I took care, they won't be coming back. No, I know who they work for and they. Hold on, I'm gonna call you back, okay? Daddy, daddy, look what I made today. Hey hey Jumpei. You have a good day? Yeah. Wow, what is this? I made it all by myself. I spent my whole break time. Is this for me? Yeah. Wow, I love it. Let's find a good place for this in the restaurant. Yeah. Come on, let's go home. All right, darling? Yeah I'm fine baby, but you seem a little tense. Is there anything I can do? Where those men making you angry? Well those men, Vanessa, are gonna change everything. Ooh, everything? Everything. I like the sound of that. Dylan. Go bring the car out front, mate. We're gonna head out, yeah? Sorry darling, I've got to go. Yes, is everything okay? Everything okay dad? Yes, everything's fine. Well the kitchen needs you, the restaurant's filling up. Okay, I'll be there in minute, just handle it for now. Sorry, it was Mio. I'm worried they are going to do something. Yasuyuki, I really need your help. I can't risk anything happening to my family. I think it might be a good idea for you to join us for dinner and get to know my family. Would you do that Yasuyuki? Great, I will send you our address. See you soon. See you boss, thanks for tonight. I'll be back in next week. I'm off on holiday tomorrow. - Where are you off to again? - Mexico, boss. Family re-union. Oh that's right, Mexico. Well enjoy the Tequilas! Haha will do. Thanks boss. Thanks! Hello, Mr Kinji. So nice of you to finally arrive, huh. Just getting friendly and acquainted with young Timmy here, and his plans for Mexico. Such a fantastic destination. Would be a terrible shame if he was never to see his friend. No, leave him out of this, he has nothing to do with it. Let him go. He is our esteemed colleague, surely has everything to do with our business. Look, I have your money, just let him go and we can settle this. Why didn't you say so? Enjoy the margarita's friend. And be careful of the women, they are very, very nasty. Where were we, oh yes. Go get my money. Fucking shit hole. What's this? Here, take it. Wasn't so hard, was it? But if I get one more sniff that you are trying to avoid our business it will not be the neck of Timmy under my arm, it will be the neck of your little boy, Jumpei. It will be a terrible... Stop! Leave my family out of this, I will pay you. Just leave my family alone. Good, it appears we are getting somewhere. See you next month my good friend. Listen up. We must find him no matter what. - This is your mission. Understood? - Yes, sir. - Boss. - What is it? It's for you, boss. Yes, hello, what is it? Everybody out. Now! You've found him? Where is he? London!? Which restaurant? I will send Kazuki to assist you. Make sure you return what is ours, no matter what. Well done, you should be proud. Prepare Kazuki. Send him to London immediately. Make sure he brings the device back. We have to finally put an end to this. - Kinji Suzuki must die. - Understood. We've found him. Eat some vegetables too. You've really come a long way with your cooking, Mio. Thanks for prearing dinner tonight. You haven't finished it yet, Mum! Besides, I've learned from the best, haven't I, Dad? I'm not sure your father would consider himself the best... Well, I think both of your cooking is delicious. I can definitely see you taking over from your Dad one day. Mio, can you answer the door? - Would you like some? - Thank you. Kinji? Cheers... Are you eating vegetables? - Hey everyone! - Hello! Akiho's here. Did you cook this Mio? Looks amazing! - Please join us. - Thank you. Have some food. Nice to see you. - How are your parents? - They are fine. When did we see them last? 6 months ago? - I heard you moved? - Yes, we have. - Where to? - Just nearby. Really? How near? Walking distance? About 10 minutes. Really? You should come by more. Mio didn't tell us. Mio, who's that man? Dad's new friend. He often comes to the restaurant. Don't you think he's handsome? - Didn't know you like older men. - Not like that. But he's very nice. - Who made this miso soup? - Mio. She cooked it all. Except for the Nori seaweed... Yeah, the seaweed and the pickles. Isn't Mio's cooking great? You should ask her to cook again. Right, Mio? So Yakuyuki, tell us more about your work. Kinji tells me you're a lawyer? How long have you been doing that? Let me think... Well I worked in this field for many years back in Japan. So maybe around 15-20 years. Oh wow, you must be very experienced then. Yasuyuki is going to help our family business. Make sure everything's in order for us. Really? Well we must be in very safe hands then. - Would you like some more? - Thank you. I feel drunk now. Is everything okay? Hey! Hey, yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Um, can I help? No, I'm just, last one here. - Oh. - All done. Thanks, my love. It was a really nice dinner with Yasuyuki-san tonight, wasn't it? Yeah, he liked Mio's fish. He seems to be a very nice man. Yes, he is. I'm really glad you have sorted out those men who came to the restaurant last month. I was really worried that. You don't need to worry, Sakura. I will always make sure you're safe, before anything. Protecting you and the kids is all I care about. You know this restaurant, it's just a business. We can change it anytime we want to. Well hopefully we don't have to change too many more times. I'm beginning to like London. Oh? Mm-hm. Me too. I'm gonna go and check on the kids. Okay. I'll see you soon. Welcome to the Madarin, may I take your name? Yes yes, of course. Leave it! I will take this. - Yasuyuki! So good to see you. - Good to see you too. - I wanted to thank you for a lovely dinner. - That's very sweet. Your cooking was delicious, Mio. Thank you, Yasuyuki. Such beautiful flowers! It was so lovely to have you over, you must join us again. It would be my pleasure. - Maybe Junpei can cook next time! - Maybe! Kinji should be here soon if you wanted to say hello? That's okay, I have a few meetings to get to. Send him my regards. See you again soon. Thank you, I will do. We'll look forward to seeing you soon. - Thank you again for the flowers! - You're welcome. Bye. - Look. - They're beautiful. Why do you always get the flowers! I can't help being the best chef in the family, Mum. Good for you. Well well well, you must be Kazuki. Normally I'd say I've heard a lot about ya, but I haven't. Please, sit down. Girls. No. Fuckin' hell, looks like we're straight down to business, boys. You know I've been working this city for 15 years. I never come across a Jap as highly feared as you. See that's what I love about this town. You never know who's around the corner, do ya? Never ceases to... I didn't come here to talk about your history, I came here to talk about a man that I need to find. And I understand you are the person to find such people. I'm sorry, is this your club? Huh? Is this your fucking city? Because I'm beginning to feel like I'm in Japan or some other stupid fucking country, where people don't know who the fuck I am! Do you know who the fuck I am? Yes, I know. You're the person who's gonna find me, Kinji Suzuki. Half now. Half after we're getting him. Look at this, fuckin' hell. At least you put your money where your mouth is, mate. What's so special about this Kinji Suzuji anyway, huh? What kind of name is that? What makes him special is my business, not yours. You just need to find him for me. Now. You come into my town, you want me to clean up your mess. You say it's not my fucking business. Who the fuck do you think you are, huh? Throw him the fuck out, now. I came here looking for answers, but all you've done is show me problems. I was told you are the person who could find me anyone in London. And supposedly run things here. Now, can you find this man for me, or am I gonna have to tear this city apart until I find him myself? Be careful who you're fucking talking to, yeah? I'll find this man for ya, but once I do, if I don't like what I see, I'll kill him my fucking self. And I'll send you both back in a box to where you belong, yeah? I will be hearing for more then. Well, fucking get up you morons. What the fuck am I paying for you stupid idiots? Just stand there like a bunch of fucking lemons. Get out there and find him and bring him back here now. Yes boss. Right then, come on lads, let's go. Yes, I'm making progress. However the people I'm working with over here are useless. But rest assured, if they don't find him then I will. Yes. I will update you at the end of each day until I do. - Kinji. - Yasuyuki. Thanks for meeting me. I wasn't expecting your call so soon. You sounded worried. Everything okay? You know I have an office... No, not in your office. I don't want anyone to know about this, especially my family. Anyway, you said you could help? Of course, I can always help professionally. I don't think the law's going to help me. These men won't stop until they've bled my restaurant dry. I can't let them do this to my family. - I had to do something. - Don't worry. I have contacts in many different areas. I can help you. I need you to get me something. Okay. - Anything you need. - Thank you. Frank! Oh Frank. Where the fuck are you? Oh shit. What are you running for, Franky? Hello gorgeous, hello. What have you done, aye Frank? Nothing, nothing, I just, look I got no money okay. I, I, I got nothing left. Everyone's bled me dry, I got nothing. You better not be fucking lying to me. I'm not. Bye, Frank. We don't need for the money anyway. Better give us someone, some chat by the name of Kinji Suzuki. Apparently he has a restaurant round these neck of the woods. Know anything about him? Name doesn't ring a bell. You fucking. Do me a favor will ya, we know you know every fucker in this business. Now tell us where he is and we'll make it worth your while. What? You heard me. Really? What would you like, Frank? Um, well if you could make it so the Russians never set foot in here that would be nice. All right, done. Okay good. Now where's the fucking Jap? I don't know, I don't know, but. Ask the Russians, they'll know him okay. They run every restaurant, they'll know. The Russians. You better not be fucking lying to me, Frank. I'm not, I'm not. All right, but you know what? It's about time we paid those dirty Russians a visit anyway. Yeah, you guys can take them. You call us if you hear anything, all right? Sure sure, same same, cell, mobile? Shut up. Okay. And Frank, so this fucking restaurant here, it's a shit hole. Maybe change the menu or something. Sure. All right George, come on, let's go. Stop serving those bacon triple cheeseburgers. I can't fucking help myself and they're making me fat! All right, just gotta call the boss quick then. Hello, boss? Yeah, apparently the Russians know where he is. Yeah. So what, you want me to set up a meet, or what? Yeah all right. All right I'm on it. Fuck me Georgie boy, this could get very ugly mate, very ugly indeed. Fucking hate the Russians. Yeah me too, George, me too. Eh, can't we get a little massage before we head back? Massage? Yeah, one of those Thai one's, better than the others. You having a fucking laugh? No. All right, just a quick one. Huh, I'm always quick. Oh! Fuck! What do I owe the pleasure of that slap, darling? I told you to get rid of those whores from our club. All right Vanessa, but this is a night club, isn't it? Guess you haven't realized, sometimes that means having chicks around, keeping customers happy. Yeah, I get that Vincent, but right now we have no customers and it's the middle of the fucking day. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. I beg to differ, darling. I consider myself a customer right now, wouldn't you guys? Yeah, me too! Shut up, Dylan, all right? Sorry darling, how could I be so rude. All right girls, piss off. Kinji? Hey, hey my love. Is everything all right? Yeah, yeah. Everything is fine. Just another late shift at the restaurant. You're wet. It's raining. Hm, you didn't take the trolley? I never take the trolley. You know, you should take some of your own advice and have a few days off. Maybe we can go away for the weekend, without kids. Hm? Maybe we can. That sounds like a, yeah that sounds like a, that sounds like a good idea. Maybe even more if we need to. Now we're talking. Um, maybe we can go up to the lakes. I knew you'd say that. That does sound nice. Let's figure out a time we can close the restaurant for a few weeks. Come up to bed. I will soon. Okay. Love you. Love you too. Don't stay up too late. All right, come on lads. Let's make this quick. I fucking hate the Russians. Sounds good, boss. Fucking hate them too. Don't worry boss, we got you covered. Good. We'll wait for, Vincente the villain, he's coming shortly. Practice our English. I hate the fucking English. Vincent! How nice of you to pop in. What's goin' on in here, lads? Looks like some rich boy's fucking wedding. Who's the lucky man? Has Ivan finally tied the knot, have ya? Ya fuck, get your fucking ear on, mate. What can we do for you? Please, take a seat. All right, I'll tell you what you can fucking do for us. You can start by telling us where this Kinji fucking Suzuki's hold up, yeah? Some fucking Yakuza mob just flew in from Japan and they want me to find him. So I need to know where he is and what makes him so fucking valuable, yeah? Now, do you boys know anything or what? If we do, what is in it for us? What's in it for you? I'll tell you what's in it for you, mate. I'll let you keep extorting all my fucking restaurants in London, that's what's in it for you. Listen Vincent, yes we have an arrangement. You have the clubs, we have the restaurants. But I am not in business with you. Hang on a minute. Hang on a fucking minute. We let you come here and set up shop in London, yeah? And you say it's not my fucking business? Your business is my fucking business, ya bunch of fucking hooligans. Relax, relax. We can handle this like adults. Sit the fuck down you beautiful man. It's okay, Ivan, sit. Vincent, it's very simple. If we give you this information, we want something out of it. All right. Fair is fair, yeah? How bout a 100 grand? There well, that wasn't so hard, was it? We'll take 100 now, and 100 when you get the boy. Deal. Done. Now, where the fuck is he? Oh let me try and remember. He is in a little Japanese restaurant on the corner of Beale street and Shaft avenue. And he has a very, very pretty wife. Nice. But be very careful, she bites. Now, I'm afraid I must ask you to leave. We have a very important event here today, to which you are not invited. All right, whatever. Pleasure doing business, as always. Yeah, whatever. See ya later lads. Ya fuck. Thanks for the drink. Cheers fuckers. Come on lads. Let's go find this fucking Jap. Fuckers of mothers. You must be the wife. Not bad for a Jap. Well I'm more of a Thai man myself. Can I help? Most certainly can, love. You can start by telling everyone here to get the fuck out of the restaurant, now! Everybody out! Get out! What are you doing? I told your people I would pay. Why are you here again? Those people you're referring to, mate, work for me, yeah? Everyone in this fucking city works for me. Whether they're Russian, or Jewish, or whatever the fuck they wanna be. I make the rules and decide who works for who, all right? Now, you must be Kinji Suzuki. Is that right? Yes, that's me. What do you want? What I want from you? Well that's a million fucking dollar question, mate. But it's not what I want from you, it's what some fucking Yakuza mob wants from you, and they want me to hand you over for a lot of fucking money. And I want to know what makes you so fucking valuable. I have no idea what you're talking about. I have no idea who these people are or what they wanted. Maybe you have the wrong person. There are many Kinji's in London. Yeah there fucking are, that's why it took so long to fucking find you, didn't it, huh? But what did you do to get the Yakuza mob on your back? - Nothing. - That's what I want to know. Nothing, please. I've done nothing. They must, it must be a different last name. Su, Suzumi. All right, let him go. Go on. Listen, it doesn't matter what I've done to them, you can't hand me over. They'll kill my family. I don't think you seem to understand the situation here, mate. We'll be doing the killing if you don't tell me what I want to fucking hear! Okay, okay, look. I'll pay you double what they're paying, just give me a week to get the money. I'll get you the money, I promise. Just please, don't hand me over to them, please. I'll tell ya what, I'll give you three days to get me two million quid. That's two million quid, yeah? Or I hand you over to them on a silver fucking platter. Please, just don't hand me over to them. All right, all right, just calm down mate, calm down. But if I find out you're lying to me, if you don't hand over the fucking money, this will all be over before you know it, yeah? All of it. Let's get the fuck out of here. This man's got some money to find. I like what you've done with the place. Got a bit of classic Asia to it. Be a shame if it all came burning down. See you around, Kinji. - Hey my love. - Kinji, what's going on? Who were those men? What do they want? Listen, I will explain everything later, okay? Just get what you need and go get the kids, okay? Yasuyuki's arriving any minute to take you somewhere safe while I figure all this, this stuff out, okay? Just please, please listen to me. I need to get you and the kids somewhere safe. But Kinji, you said this would be the last time we move. I know, I know, I'm sorry and I promise I will make it up to you, I promise. But what about the kids? They were settled in their schools. How long will it be? I don't know until I can, Until I can fix everything and sort everything out. Yasuyuki's here, we gotta go. Here, take these bags and pack whatever you need to. We need to leave right away. My love, just go get the kids, I'll help pack the bags, okay? Yasuyuki's gonna take you somewhere safe, I promise I'll be with you as soon as I can. Quick. Hurry! Okay, this will be the last time, you have my word. Mio, Jumpei. What you mean, endask isn't a word, come on. Jesus. Kinji Suzuki. Oh Jesus Christ, how many times do I have to tell you guys? Ask the fucking Russians. Russians? Yes. Whoa, you don't, you don't look like one of them. I am the Yakuza. Okay, I, I, I don't know where he is, okay? Like I told the others, just ask the Russians. Where can I find the Russians? Majestic Soho, just please, please, please leave me out of it. Just don't tell him, I, just don't, don't tell him I told you where. Oh come on, man. For your inconvenience. For me? You better not be lying to me. I am not lying. Okay. Wow. Get to work. All right, all right, all right. All right, all right, fun's over boys, fun's over. Gotta talk business. Go on, Vanessa. Right. It's been three days. It's time to collect our money, yeah? Yes boss. So should we take all the lads or? What can one little Asian man do, huh? We gotta keep our bases covered, yeah? Just get out there, find our money, bring him back here in one piece. What you mean boss, what, are we finishing him off? Nah, I haven't decided yet. I don't trust him, yeah. We gotta find out what he's hiding and what makes him so valuable. So that Yakuza mob, we can't have them coming to this town thinking they run the place, yeah? 'Cause that's not how we do business around here boys, is it? Damn right it's not. Anything you want boss, anything. Good, well quit sitting here like a bunch of fucking tarts, get out there, find my money, bring him back here now. And turn the restaurant upside down if you have to. Whatever he's hiding, is gonna be there somewhere. We're on it boss. All right boss, we'll be back soon, all right. Yeah. This is the one. All right, gonna rough him up good and proper before we bring him back to the boss, all right? Can we get some food in before we head back? It's proper tasty here. Don't be so ridiculous you fat fuck. Have some will power. We'll get some food later. Fuckin' starvin'. You just have to control yourself then, you mug, wouldn't ya? I'll try. Can't promise anything. Kinji. Open up, open this fucking door, now. Kinji! Open the fucking door. Come on. Kinji. I said open up the door. Kinji. Open the fucking door. You fucking deaf? What you got the door locked for, you mug? Where's our fucking money? You don't know what you're dealing with. The Yakuza will stop at nothing until they get what they want. Just fucking let us worry about the Yakuza. This is our town, nobody tells us how to do things around here. Especially not some Japanese mob. Now go and get us our fucking money. Okay, okay. It's in my office. Over there. I'll get it for you. No. We're here, we'll get it. George, go and get the money. All right boss. Hurry up. Good boy. It's all here, Dylan. Now to hunger. Get some of that chicken teri, teriyaki stuff now, yeah? Dylan! What the fuck? Dylan! What the? Follow him. Fuck. Where the fuck are they? They should have been here by now. I dunno boss, they said they're coming straight back. Yeah I know what they said, you idiot. Don't just stand there, go out there and find them and bring them back here now. - Eh? - Yes boss. Come on. What, now? Yes! Don't worry baby, I'm sure they're fine. Here... Thank you. Are you okay? I'm sorry. Everything's going to be just fine. Don't you worry Junpei. Thank you for everything, Yasuyuki. Kinji told us to trust you. - I'm glad he has a friend like you. - You're welcome. It's a dangerous city. We're all here for each other. Is this your house Yasuyuki? Hey, hey, isn't that Yakuza, geezer? I think you're right, mate. What do you think we should do, call boss? Of course we should call the boss. Get to the back and out what we need. Will do. Come on. Hey, Zeke. Can I have the shot in this time, yeah? Yeah mate, go on, it's your turn. All right, get in there. Kazuki... - How did you find me? - You're not that hard to find, Kinji. You didn't think moving to the other side of the world would prevent us from finding you, did you? - Give me that bag! - What are you going to do with it? You can't release it, no one would... We'll decide what's best for it. It was never yours to take, Kinji. Well well well. If it isn't tweedle dumb and tweedle fucking dee, huh? You finally found him, boys. Good job. Now, what the fuck is going on in here, eh? Stay back, Vincent. He belongs to me now. You've played your part in finding him, whatever part that was. Now, just turn around and go back to your club. Otherwise, I start shooting. Turn around and go back to our fucking club? Are you having a fucking laugh, mate? Who the fuck do you think you are, huh? You think you can come here and just take my people willy fucking nilly, huh? I don't know what you want. Just let the two of us leave. We can call this a day, huh? I have what I need now. Yeah? And what is it that you need so badly that you flew all this way over for, huh? He belongs to the Yakuza. It's our property. It has nothing to do with you! I'll fucking decide if it's got anything to do with me or not, you fucking walnut, all right? Now I've decided, I want what's in that fucking bag. No no no no no. I will never let this out of my sight again. It doesn't belong to you. Fucking hell. Vincente! There you are. Long time. Who would have thought that we would be together again in the same building just like old times? My fucking god, what the fuck are you lot doing here, huh? I didn't ask for your input on this one. We can handle this by our fucking self, all right? Like Bob Dylan sing, the times they are a changing, and you, are losing control over whatever you think you have control of. I mean, who would let the Japanese mob walk all over you? We had a partnership, you broke it! Now I am going solo. I want what is in that bag. If it's so fucking valuable, Moscow will have a piece of it. All right, now listen here, Igor. Firstly, you work for me you bald fuck. This ain't a fucking partnership, yeah? And secondly, I ain't letting any Japanese mob walk all over me, 'cause as of right now mate, there is no fucking Japanese mob. What took you so long? Chop chop. All right, now Kinji, where the fuck are my boys? Kinji wake the fuck up now! Sorry, they're in my fridge, in the kitchen. In your fucking what? In the fridge. Don't worry, I turned the temperature up, they're okay. What the fuck? All right, we got what we came for. What do we do, boss? We are not leaving without that backpack. Do you understand? And if you want to have a gun fight with us, you know who's going to win, huh? Nobody, extorts my restaurant and threatens my family. Nobody! Fucking brilliant. Fucking! This guy. Steven, sort these fucking two idiots out, will ya. I'll see you around Kinji, yeah? And one more thing, thanks for the backpack. Now, go back to your family and live whatever normal life you lot fucking get up to. If you keep your head down, you might just get by. Yasuyuki! Are they okay? Thank god. Thank you. Thank you! I'll be there as soon as I can. - Kinji! - Sakura! Yasuyuki! What are you doing!? Put that gun down! Sakura, are you okay? Where is Junpei and Mio!? Kinji... Where's the device? What device? Don't play dumb Kinji! I saw you put it in your backpack at the restaurant. If you don't give it to me... No, no! Leave Sakura out of this! She's done nothing. The backpack Kinji. I'm running out of patience. Look, I don't have it anymore! Vincent has it. He took it from me after he killed the Russians! When? Before I got here! I led them all to a warehouse. Why are you doing this Yasuyuki? I trusted you... Well, you were mistaken. Give me that backpack or your wife and kids will die. No! Where is Junpei, Mio? They are tied up somewhere safe, for now. How did you know about the backpack? Didn't they teach you anything in government intelligence? I've been watching you all of this time, Kinji. The night the Russians first came to your restaurant. And who do you think sent Kazuki to find you. You didn't think Hideshi would just let you go, did you Kinji? Make sure you return what is ours, no matter what. Well done, you should be proud. You've been playing me this whole time? Ever since... Yes Kinji, ever since I first found you here in London. - Well done for finally working it out. - Stop. I have it. It's in the back of my car. I have to go outside to get it for you... just leave my family alone. Not so fast, Kinji, you will lead me to it. I'm not that stupid. Okay. - Please! - Shut up! I'm talking. Bring me to it now! This way. - Where is it? - Over there. - Hurry up! - Okay. It's inside the boot. Hurry! Hurry up! - It's inside the boot. - Hurry up! Okay. Now let Sakura go and you can have the backpack. I don't think you're in a position to be making demands. Oh yeah, how about now... Stop! One more move and I destroy the device. If you don't believe me, you are welcome to try. Let Sakura go and you can have the backpack. I don't believe you. You would never... Yasuyuki, whatever's inside doesn't mean as much to me as my family. I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to make sure they are safe. Sakura! Sakura, are you okay? I'm so sorry. I never meant to put you through any of this. Mio, Junpei! Are you okay? Junpei! Mio! I said that, you know. Aw, thank you. Oh yeah, did you see his face? Georgy, love ya mate. Hey boys, let's have a toast. - Toast? - Yeah? To our fucking good health and to teaching those fuckers who runs this town. - Yeah! - Hey, cheers! I am so sorry, my love. I never meant for any of this to happen. This will all be over now, I promise. How can you be so sure? You've said this to me several times now. And look where we are. In about 30 seconds, we'll never have to worry about anything ever again. Why? What's happening in 30 seconds? It's just a present I left for someone, that's all. Kinji? Trust me. Trust me. Hey boys, any thoughts on what seat we should take over next, huh? Russia. Russia? It's a fucking country, mate. It's the fucking same, ain't it? Fucking cold there. Somewhere warm. Oh shit. Kinji! What's wrong? Is everything all right, Kinji? Everything is fine. Everything is perfectly fine. So how do you all feel about moving to New York? New York? Come on guys, let's go home. Jumpei, you want to see the Statue of Liberty, right? Yeah.
