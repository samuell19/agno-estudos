No, do not do this There is a stranger here which are these soldiers Wait! Wait Wait! Are not you the old mountain man? Sir! If I knew you were working for Dayongon, I would have asked for your help I was hiding from me and traveling with the maps, was not it enough? Not so, I wanted to take my time. Make sure the maps are correct But, why did you catch up with us from Hanyang to here? There are already people who have tagged all places on the map The problem is about all these signs The map showed that the place was just 20 miles away. But the reality is even more Counting all directions from top to bottom. The real distance will exceed 40 miles To make a correct map. You should know the real distance well If, you calculate the real distance all the way to here? Yes that's right I've calculated every mile along the way And carefully calculated even half-miles Every mile and every five miles. You write down everything I'm still alive thanks to your help I am grateful for that. But I have to go now Where do you want to go now? Where should a person like me go? To a place I've never visited. That's what I have to do for this man That person is Kim Jeong-hoo? That's right, Your Majesty Are you trying to kill me? What if I owned this country and my words were royal orders? I understand, sir, the father of the king I am only the king's father, Dayongon will go to places he did not visit After this mountain there will be a mountain higher than it After this river, there will be a larger river A river followed by a river. After a mountain, I will never stop Jeju Island: Songak Mountain So, from this road to another road. I will continue Mara Island Koga Island Ulsan Lighthouse Yeosu: Rosie Bay Northern River Han river Hapachon: Hwangmi Mountains 35 years ago, Pyong-An, the rebels of Hong Gyong Rai Discrimination is not just everything They asked for our help when they needed us, for 400 years and more No one from Pyeong-An managed to enter the royal court as a state employee Let's go Follow me, I am Hung Gyeong Rai! We will expel them all and take over the Empire Let 's go to Hanyang Huanghai: provincial government office Hong Gyong Rai is coming Its strength extends from Paju to Han-Kyung Island How is there no official or citizen willing to intervene? They are farmers who do not even know how to carry weapons How can we overnight give them weapons rather than farming tools? why not? Make them dressed in army uniforms and become soldiers I can not even save 20-30 soldiers how will they look at my hands? Now, I can not even control my family Shut up! Just give them clothes and free food we do not even have a guide, how can we We do not need any guide Maps are good Using the map you two Take the maps and go there The mountain will be filled with snow if something bad happens on the road So what can I do? I'm also worried about this But if we get there in 4 days we have to pay for food and dress However, we do not have to follow a path that no one has ever taken We will do our best Because we need food and dress badly My Father Gyeong-ho Mr. Hoon gave it to me You said you might need it in the mountain It must be expensive. Thank him on my behalf My Father The real man does not cry Do not worry, I'll go home safely Let's go! We were late as we got to the map Be careful! To move quickly The sun never appears. If we continue, we will freeze to death We may die of cold. We must go back, Hyungnim What if we lost the road at night? What are you saying? - Do you want to die together? And observe all of you According to the map, we are approaching Only 5 miles left Oh really? To move quickly What is that? What are these endless mountains? So, now we are not just walking in a mountain, but in a mountain range We will die here! Maps can not be wrong, right? According to the map, there is a small road between these two mountains This is a map adopted by the state Let us rely on them again Gyeong-ho, Jeong-hoo if this is what our state of Joson looks like I heard that Hung Gyong Ray died He died a month ago So, what about my father? if Hung Gyong Rai had died a month ago My father disappeared three months ago Here Gyeong-hoo, I'll go down and find your father I said he took the compass with him? Oh my God, Yoo Yun here They froze to death They become like ice There are lots of mountains, but there is only one mountain on the map It would have been better if it had not been.

Sandalwood, molasses or camphor wood All of them are wood But the camphor is good and it would be better if the sandal Just take the mulberry wood This scoundrel, I asked for my opinion Sandalwood is very expensive. You can not use it But if you want to use both sides of the board, the mullet is not good enough It will crash easily But mollies are common, you can find them anywhere. It's very easy to work on Is it your board? It's a tablet, I'm the one who will use it But I'm the one who will do it anyway If you would call me sandalwood Just take the mole These are the best to burn Wood spread is the most boring work at all The man must know how to keep his promises If you like chipping So take advantage of this opportunity and start working for me No way!

What a shameful act This is true These are here My God, this man Take a look at this He wrote that this area is 90 miles away, but it is full of mountains. So, if you believe it is 90 miles, then you are an idiot. Because you are going up and down True, the mountains Even if it is a flat area, and you walk 30 miles a day It takes at least half a month Help me take a look at this please Where? Where?

Thank you Take care of yourself Ok Gather yourselves, gather all of you ...I've heard ...that you are hawkers Even though you carry a lot of luggage and move around However, you have high integrity and honesty I have always appreciated your integrity So... If you will devote this integrity to your country I am sending an order To the officials to make you an independent organization Great Prince Great Prince You came in time Shake me Great Prince Great Prince This is a promise from the prince of the great court Long live the great prince Long live the great prince Long live the great prince Why did you choose street vendors, sir? "Long live the great prince" "Long live" They are just greedy traders who care about their own interests The Council of Ministers wishes to increase its financial strength by regular means This is their goal But these people are traveling by the foot They get lots of information Now that we have taken control of their own organization It will grow stronger Yet we still need a lot of money 20 million Is this enough to start? Yes, Smok So... start looking for a rich one Orchid flower painted by Prince Deyongon Has deep and strong roots And sharp twigs It is unique and truly exotic Each branch is full of anger "Each of its branches is full of anger" Do not you feel that luck? You kill clan, to make your stability, lasts for thousands of years You have killed the clans and exploited all members of the royal family, including my older brother That hatred and anger I am emptying it now by just drawing the Orchid Your name Even the great king says he can close his eyes to money Do I have to close my eyes too? That hatred and anger I will sell it for 20 million Yang That money, against the blood and neck of your clan It is cheap and cheap At least as long as my son Above the throne He painted orchids and then asked 20 million? He said he would ignore his hatred for 20 million But he is not someone who can forgive that easy ..even though How many members of the royal family did we kill? According to the information of our spies It plans to establish an organization that includes all street vendors Even sellers will recruit them? If so, we must take our step We tell our intelligence network They should watch it carefully and do not miss anything But, There is one thing that has recently attracted Daungon But it is very strange a stranger? Wow! Accelerating its completion does not mean it will be good I work and you look Gosh. What is that? , I have corrupted them all While you are sculpted and you do not look Do it again If, give me some food while you make me work I have seen the sea like the small river and the large mountains like the hills Gosh Ok Looking at your talk about food all day long There is no chance of becoming a great artist I did not drink anything. I did not even drink water How can you afford this? Bear what? I'm starving Lets see what we can eat where is the food? Kim Sun-shill Have you scared my beauty?

I went to see Yugu Aguma At this night? The day will appear soon At the time of your absence, we slept together But, Why worry suddenly? I can not sleep Before I see my daughter If during the last three years did not grow at all? I am a man doing business for the state... You are my family, you must understand me If you talk like that General Lee Sun-shin was no longer home during the war for seven years He returned to the battlefield after his family was killed By comparison, I am nothing Compare yourself to who? You have not saved the country Sason Shell Maps are not something that everyone can do It is great and in the interest of the people and the state For this girl To help the state, you will make your daughter an orphan I do not have to do this, ofcourse That's why I returned home after 3 years Because I really missed my daughter Do you worship the temple? Both So why are you wearing a rug? When I wear it My heart feels reassured I feel that I am receiving the blessing Right I have to go to fetch sardine sauce I love this sauce too These two children she is really beautiful! As a painting! Let me see This is a series of mountains, not the one I told you before A mountain or a mountain range is the same You bastard, do you want to die? I have told you many times The mountain chain must be connected to some not separate It must appear in a clear, connected appearance. It is distinguished from the normal mountain He also explained the difference between rivers, freshwater and oceans God, the land is straight while the water is winding Why are not there any words here? 10 miles at the length of one finger Did not I tell you to explain it to him? My God, I just painted it There is no difference Boy, this is bad you idiot Every 2 cm on the map will be 10 miles in fact If people followed these maps wrong, and lost at night... ..You will be the cause of their death What? Who will kill people? Gosh. I will not talk more about this. You're really crazy crazy? She is the mean bastard She became disrespectful do you think there is a person in this country who does not know you're crazy about maps? If I were obsessed with drawing, I painted paintings for money But you're crazy with maps that are useless Oh boy You're addicted to money at this small age, huh? My God, seriously My Father This idiot does not have the right to eat What is the matter? You still want to eat, right? You are really rude What are you doing? He is Prince Dayongon Gosh He knelt down Quickly Quickly Who does this girl bend? This trend This trend They are hot These drafts of the Great East Map? This is true I'm still working on trying to complete them There are 19 horizontal maps and 22 vertical maps Was drawn according to specific laws So that it is easy to carry the required part only and move it easily All we need is to choose the right map Also, the terrain is described in a very helpful way There are more than thirteen thousand and one hundred places in Joson Including roads, stations, warehouses, cities and mountains Eat it exist here? This is true Why did you choose to sculpt it on a wooden board? If you draw the map on paper Everyone who copies it will change it a bit But If we carved it once on a good wooden board Everyone will be able to use it easily Once you look at the wooden panels! Can a person know his way? If, I would like to buy them all Do not worry, I will not underestimate your right to the price this is good Do you owe a loan with interest? No, no, you do not need to pay for it After a short period. You will find it every where in the town After that, I will make many copies of it And anyone will be able to use them when I need them Are you crazy? The map of state secrets The other countries are trying to control our state We do not know when the war will come There is nothing as important to the state as maps How can you map with such precision for the general public to give? How can you map with such precision for the general public to give? Our people have the right to know how our country looks Even in the event of war, They can find a way to escape or fight What if they sell it to other countries? Your name If you do not trust your people, who will trust them? I am also one of those people If you do not trust your people, Will you trust the map you made? In any case, there is still a missing place in these maps what is this place? It is the island of Pusan Pusan Island It is a small island located after the island of Oulong Of course I know Excuse me Every time I go to it So, I could not check the terrain there Make an integrated map that even includes that island And a person with authority like Smok wouldn't think of interrupting the dream of a normal citizen Shut up, do you want to die? Listen to your ears that you are crazy on maps and you seem to be really crazy I heard the talk that was between you I was afraid of death How dared to argue with someone like him? The crazy person does not choose. Among the people on who shows his madness Maybe he considers me such a person But, as someone who looks at the earth, what are you talking about today? But, as someone who looks at the earth, what are you talking about today? Who said that I see only the earth? I see the sky and the stars Oh really? So look at the North Star compared to the spring star is more glowing Even if you walked in the dark darkness The direction will never be lost, as long as it follows So, she's the queen of stars The distance between the star of the north and the earth The latitude of this earth This is one of the most important things when drawing a map I'll let you know later My God, and who told you I would learn those things? As long as we only see the earth, we can not draw a whole map Wait and see someday, at the top of this sky Someone will be able to make a map. He sees the entire world from above There is something I have also imagined When riding horses, your map will be placed on horseback However, when the direction changes, your map also changes with the direction So, what direction do you take, be fully aware of it What do you think? You really are a villain This idea deserves to be recorded by history ...you villain - really? Have you just said wonderful words? Ofcourse, your idea is distinctive and innovative if, in this case also What if I add her voice like the sound of Sun Shill! That would be amazing What? 10 Miles, Turn Right! 5 Miles, Turn Left A warning beep sounds automatically emitted when driving fast I hope you reduce your speed Yes like this? Thank you very much! Stop talking about this nonsense And also Is not Sun Shill the same for you that you are always talking about? if I lived and I speak about it is possible What is possible? I really do not know! Do not know? what do you mean? Perhaps, I can live under one roof - You bastard You and your devilish thoughts Listen carefully As long as I am alive, I allow it to happen I understood well, my wife's father Your wife's father? Foolish! What? This time they want every house of Alvin Yang? Yes, that's why we're all here With the money they take from us Sedmon is our clan I had to kill Hyung-san before I already told you before The sudden thing that the great prince wants. Get him at all costs I mean the great map of the East? What is the Great Map of the East? It is a map made by a person called Kim Jong-hoo. It seems to be a very distinctive map Since it will be carved on wood, and will make many copies This makes it easier for us to see the eight provinces But, that person refused to receive a large sum from the prince of the Great Court! He did not want to sell the map Is he a crazy person? Power and money did not change his mind Why is Hyung-Son interested in that map? If the prince took the map of the great East He then gave them to the merchants and allowed them to roam freely The food transport in North Joson has problems All his secret messages will be communicated to him He really seeks to rob all the news from the eight provinces But he, He also wants to own new things he has never owned Because of the recruitment, we have lost some of our authority If we lose the information of the eight provinces and become in possession Not only our clan, but all nobles will be destroyed Sidi, we have to have that map So, should I compete with the prince of the Great Court on that map? This map is different from your map What? This place was sent to me by Mr. Shin Won The map of Gong-gi is healthier I will check them again and correct the mistake You start from here who are you? Catch these cutters They confiscated all the stolen items Your order So... that 's not true You misunderstood Why are you doing this? My Father I am Kim Song II, from the Department of Justice These two men illegally cuts trees in our family's property Please, punish them with imprisonment After that, prepare all our stolen material Why logging trees is illegal? In addition, I have never owned trees What is the evidence that this man cut trees belonging to your clan? I have a witness here I told you that if you touched, owned trees would be problematic You... You bastard! Learn where you stand? How dare you talk? I apologize very much, sir I apologize for what he said, Sir, I hope you will calm down Any witness Answer the question to you and solve the etiquette Yes Yes Have you ever met them? Of course, I met them Warned them not to cut down those trees, because they will enter into innumerable troubles Do you still intend to deny? In fact, I did not know. That mountain has a new owner This is true When we came to that mountain we did not see any fence or protection Then, you said that you do not know that he belongs to someone else Do you think that you can evade your sins? sir As you know The tombs of our ancestors lie on that mountain So, all trees and grasses on it! Are within our possessions This map of our ancestral tombs Please take it Has been confirmed The cutting of mountain trees owned, Illegal and crime Therefore, the owner has the right to recover those materials They punished them with 10 lashes Both! Surely there is something wrong Take them off My Father! My God, Sun Shill We told you that entry is forbidden My Father! Sun Shill, Sun Shill Goma Do not you have a family too? This child is very worried about her father You, this woman really Bring all the stolen items Yeah You must carry all the maps carefully wait a moment please! Please, let me see the map of the graves There is something I want to check Check? I mean, I submitted a false document? Both! That's not what I mean I beg you Let me check them out once If he does, sir I do not want to be suspicious All of you At that time, these borders were a valley There was a fire behind the Kim family shrine Sandalwood, grasses, linden trees Did you mean that you were restoring your family's grave? And the linden trees that she made were not far from him? That's right. Two years ago, a fortune teller told me So I bought that mountain four years ago This was the same map I had seen exactly four years ago Except for the transfer of these graves You bastard! What do you do? Let him stand But these graves were moved two years ago I cut trees at least four years ago The maps were carved before the restoration of the tombs The mountain had no owner. When the trees were cut at that time So These are not stolen items How dare you utter this nonsense? Everyone knows what I said The Great Map of the East was made four years ago Kim Jong-hoo, who fled at night three years ago. He returned to the city recently wood seller, herbal seller and harp They all witness this Therefore, these timber are not stolen items I beg you, my lord, judge fairly We wanted to get out of a hole, so we fell into a well The honor of our kind sister has been stained Because of a poor person like him I apologize very much "I thought we would fall if we took the maps without justification" So I want to use the law to show that we are right Song Il Law Call him in front of the kennel This work must be done confidentially Yes, Dad True, sometimes, some things may happen to us Why not regain our health first before we start work? Our brethren have not recovered yet. If we press ourselves, our injury will get worse If so, you can consider it fateful You can hide these maps later! You will not go anywhere If you hide them later, those people will find other ways to steal them again Before that, I have to hide it as soon as possible What about Sun Shill? How can you not think of it? Father Sun Yeah Sun Shill, did you bring the vegetables? Well, we eat vegetables Son Shill! Sun Shill Gosh! Why were you angry? Oh my God, that poor girl Her destiny is no different from my fate These medicinal herbs have been gathered all day. Her father's wounds are treated Learn what is the first thing you do when you wake up from sleep? Fearing that her father had gone somewhere So, the first thing you do is open the door and search for you Why do you hit the tree with great force? These fruits will fall without strength, anyway For those who do not listen, the stick is the best teacher for them My Sun Shill is very strong This man is very stubborn So, let me teach him a lesson Do you dare to disobey the words of Sun Shill? For you, are I the most important of those maps or not? What? If I and those maps were in the water, who would be saved first? Of course I will save my dear Sun Shill How can I compare those maps to my dear daughter? You mean a lot to me, if I lost you, those maps would be meaningless to me Only three months You have only three months to go. To Pusan Island and back Go, promise, Father Can I really do that?

Ba Woo Sason Shell, Sun Shill While I punished the Japanese who entered our sea These books were found with them Do they have these maps? After you arrested the pirates who caused the problem We thought we should return these maps to you But for that, we really like to learn. Joson's method of making maps This is the first time in my life. I see a sophisticated and detailed map It 's something strange First, I would like to inform the Emir of the Royal Court about this Did not you say that?

That is right I will help him Oling Island Do not forget! Everywhere you go, take stones from me I would strongly like to know how stones look from different places The old mountain man, Kim Jeong-ho. You are in detention Has revealed the secrets of the state to the enemies. This is a great betrayal They arrested him immediately Yeah What are you doing? He did not There is evidence to suggest that you have uncovered a national secret, but you will remain silent for the end How long have you been spying for the enemy? Not long ago! I met them when I came to Usan Island Did you give them these maps? Both! They entered our coasts to hunt the sea blacks Have you sold them these maps to protect your life? That's why you're alive now That is not true Why sell my maps? I will never do it Who will believe you?

Great Map of the East The Japanese enemy was impressed its sophisticated and detailed map If you give me that map I will trust you to make maps. To serve our state .not for the service of our state The map will be useful for your greed, right? How dare you mock me? I should have put you in jail You have been able and willing to give you a chance Give me that map right away a good reason for the map is Let people use it whenever they need it But, how can people use it if you own it for your personal ambitions? The door is too high and no one can touch it A map I did not even recognize when my daughter was dying I can not deliver it for my life I will not do that at all !you idiot How can these stupid people understand and use maps? All they have to do is follow the government's orders I really appreciated you and wanted to give you a last chance But you do not seem to want it They searched his house well and found the map Yeah Go quickly Yeah In addition, his hands are a source of trouble If we leave it, it may reveal again national secrets Cut off both hands So he can not make maps anymore Do it quickly For a cartographer, if he can not map This is like death for him If you cut both hands, it would be better to cut off my neck You killed my daughter My life means nothing without it .what are you doing? Execute the judgment Stop Why does the Prince of the Great Court come to such a shabby place? Security sermons what? You are very humble when you call this grand palace a shabby place Although there are shabby things in this place Hopefully let us deal with this We are questioning a traitor who has betrayed the state Are you questioning me and saying that it's none of my business? Your Excellency Hong Son Hong Son? Well, you dared to call me in my name You She told me that you were questioning a traitor who betrayed the state But you are questioning him at home and telling me that this is an interrogation? Is your home is a royal court? Please do not misunderstand There are indications that he sold the map to the Japanese enemy incorrect! Those Japanese pirates stole my map! I did not sell my map at all to them The man did not confess the offense There are some problems in the conduct of this investigation He will be tried in the royal court Do you have any objection? Of course he should be tried in the royal court Let it be as you say But remember, Prince of the Great Court It is true that we are a little weak, but do not underestimate our clan , The strength lasted for 60 years, only because it was slightly shaken It does not mean that we will drop immediately The decaying teeth It starts shaking first and then we take it off Wait and see I take it off one by one Take him to the royal court quickly Quickly! Yeah My Father A map you did not deliver even when your daughter was in danger He will not deliver them to the Japanese for sure I also learned who saved you on Oolong Island But you have to pay for what happened I took the state map with you and stole from the Japanese, right? If you say I pay the price, you mean Would you like me to give you the map? My own opinion has not changed A map that holds state secrets. The state must control them I will give you more time So complete the map You will be jailed for one night to reveal national secrets This is the final court decision You will be released in the morning For you, are I the most important of those maps or not? What? If I and those maps were in the water, who would be saved first? Ofcourse I will save my dear Sun Shill How can I compare those maps to my dear daughter? You mean a lot to me, if I lost you, those maps would be meaningless to me Beautiful, dear Sun Shill is really beautiful My dear Sun Shill Sson Shell Wow! Can you do me a favor?
