Mommy? Daddy? So, Laura? How do you like your room? My apple tree is gone! Did your rocket ship make it in the move? Barely. We went off-course landing. Then I opened the curtain. And my beautiful apple tree was gone. And my friends. My birdhouse is gone too, my seesaw... ...and my protect-me-dog! Typical, Tommy. Come on, we'll find him. And then we'll go home. He's not here. He's not here either. - Maybe in the toy box. I think I know. I saw him somewhere. Down there! I see him! Oh yeah, my protect-me-dog! Come on Tommy, let's get him! But be careful! - Sure, sure! Tommy, hurry up! Hey! - Excuse me! Are you the kids from the 4th floor? - No, we go home tomorrow. That's right, we go home. I don't get it... You just moved in. Where'd you come from? Can you see him? There, on that car. My Pizza! My glider! - My protect-me-dog! Hey, stop, stop! Ouch... Watch out! - You dummy! Salami pizza with dog! There's the new gimpy kid. - Ha-ha, very funny. You dummies. Just look at you, uh? Look, all sticky. Don't worry. We'll give him a bath and he'll be all better. Come Tommy, let's go. We don't want anything to do with them. That's right! We don't. - Bye, have a nice lunch! Yuck! Don't move... And... So. All done. First day and you get hurt. Hurt? I almost died. Oh, well then, I should call an ambulance. No thanks, I'll be fine all by myself. That's um... Tommy, look what I found! Careful with the glider! There, here you go. Hey, Laura? Papa said I need to sleep in my new room. But we don't want to, do we, Laura? Laura? Laura! Muschka. Laura? Come here, Muschka. No, don't go in there. Come back. Where is Laura? Hot tea, careful. Maybe in her room? Hello, is anyone there? Muschka, come out of there. Oh! Oh no... What are you doing here? - Um... hi. You broke it. Why? It was an accident. Just like when you ran in to me earlier. You ran into me. - No, you ran into me! You probably put Tommy's dog on that car too. I knew it, I'm right. You've got a funny way, of making friends. I don't need friends. Tomorrow, I'm going away anyway. All the better. Then I never have to see you again. What are you doing here? - We all want to sleep in your room. This isn't my room. Where are you sleeping then? In my rocket ship. And tomorrow at my real home. Can I come in the rocket thip? No. - Why not? Because... There's not enough air supply for all of us. What are you doing? Is that how you treat a poor dog? We don't want to sleep in this dumb house. Why not? - There's no air surprise. What air surprise? - He means air supply, bad city air. Tommy, don't you start too. Laura? Are you in there? What are you doing here? Dinner's ready. There's chocolate pudding for dessert. I'm not hungry. Do you want some apple? - Laura won't come down. She wants to sleep on the roof, in her rocket. Look... Oh, my... Magic. Don't worry. Tomorrow we're going home. All we have to do is follow that bright star up there. Yeah, that's the way home. Or should we take the train? Is that a yes? You can come too. We just have to stick together, and we'll manage. That's right, my big girl. It's never easy in new surroundings. But, you know what: You'll see, not everything has changed. You see the stars? Look, they're still all there. All in their right place. We picked out this apartment, because we thought you and Tommy and Muschka would love it up here. Hmm? Won't you give our new home a little chance? Fine, but only an itty, bitty, mini chance. Okay, deal. And now off to bed. Don't make that face. You try to disappoint Mommy. Then we'll stay here a couple more days. Max, it's time for bed! - Ten more minutes, promise! Uh? Wha--? What do you want? What are you so excited about? Oh! Oh, a little star. What are you doing here? Oh, you poor thing. You're missing a point. You think you lost it here? You're far from home. Aren't you? Do you know what? I don't know anyone here either. I'll take you home. Then you won't be alone. Don't worry, my room is right around the corner. Oh, by the way, I'm Laura. What is that? Hmm. Uh? I must be crazy. It has to be here somewhere. Strange. Uh, it can move. Hey, wait! Hey, stop! Shoot. Hmm? Look what I found in the park. Isn't it pretty? Weren't you just over there? Mommy? Daddy? Mommy! You're alive. I must be dreaming. It's your broken-off point. I won't hurt you. That's what you get for hopping around. Why didn't you just listen? I told you, you can trust me. Hmm. What will I do with you? So, what color do you want? Hmm? This one? Yeah? Now, don't move. Don't be afraid, it won't hurt. So, all done. I hope it's not too tight? Do you like it? Look, it's just like mine. Exactly the same. You can fly. You're a real star. A real flying star. What's with you two? You did that. You used magic on them, right? Hmm. It's okay. I thought my little brother Tommy was spying. You know how little brothers are, right? So. Time to go to bed. Good night, Bear. Good night, Mini-Bunny. I have my own star now. A real magic star. Good night, little star. Sweet dreams. Can you turn off your glow, please? My star. Bear! Mini-Bunny! So, it wasn't a dream. But where's my star? That's the wheel from... Tommy! A real star! It sparkles, and Laura was hiding it! I talked to him about it. - Don't believe him, Mom! Tommy's lying! - I am not! Yes he is! Really, Mommy, a real star. - Zip it! Ah! Wait a sec, I can't hear. - Muschka, stop! Oops. Muschka, come here. Muschka, leave him alone. Gotcha. Look, now, Mommy! They're alive, and I can prove it! Keep quiet! Stop getting into my stuff. It's my star. Hmm. Then I get a wish. What then? - Magic him to life. Fine. It's a deal, blackmailer. What tornado came through here? - Our daughter? Make some room in there. Laura? Will you help tidy up? Laura, where are you? Where does your sheet music go? Wait, I'll arrange it. Alone, finally. Enough room in there? - Sure. Come on in, plenty of room. No thanks. I don't like cages. Laura, watch out! Flying backpacks... Look, that's a tree. Pretty, right? Almost like home. I got her backpack! - Hey, that's mine! Come get it! Here! - Pass it to me! That's mine! - Here, to me! Give it back. - Here! That's what you get. What kind of trick was that? - That wasn't a trick. I'm telling you, she's a witch. Thanks, star, that was way cool. But you can't overdo it. I'll make people curious. Especially those boys. They're dummies. Wow. Cool. Now, Laura? Your promise? - Wait. Come in and close the door, Tommy. I have to show you something first. I have a present. For my star. So... Sit down. Cover your eyes. No cheating. So. Everybody ready? And now, eye's open. Hey, careful! Don't hurt yourself, little star. That's not really space. Oh... Cool. Oops. Hey, you forgot something. Your ring. ...19, 20. Here I come! Hmm. Hmm. Gotcha! Hey, Tiny Tom, are you a witch too? That was super. Look, this is my apple tree. It's just as old as me. Miaow. Oh no. You promised me! It's about to rain, and then it'll be all ruined. "The Milky Way is a galaxy in space." "It's our home galaxy." "One of these is our sun." "... sun. The stars are kept together by gravity." It looks like a museum in here. The opera is is over 200 years old. Many great musicians have performed here. And now you are. - M-hm. After you. Look out, Tommy. Hi, Maria. Solo rehearsing again? - No. I'm showing my workplace to my family. Break a leg tonight. - It'll be fine. Daddy, why “break a leg"? “'Break a leg”? It's what you say before a premiere, for luck. Hmm? Why didn't you tell me the opera is so beautiful? Wait till you see the auditorium and hear the sound. Hey, Daddy? Shush. Not now. Uh-oh. Laura. - I'll be right back. Star? Little star! Where are you? Star! You like it here, eh? Does it remind you of your home? Star, where do you want to go? Please, not so high! Hey, come back, little star! It's not funny! What's the matter, hmm? You really scared me. Cucumber? - M-hm. Mommy, what's for dessert? Are you full? - Yes. One more bite. Daddy? - Yes? Where do stars belong? Eh... In space? And in a child's room, right? Sure. I had stars in my old room. They were little stickers. And they even glowed. Radish, anyone? I want more cheese. - Tommy, eat your bread first. Mommy? - M-hm? Can stars be sad? Who knows. When they are lonely and far away from home? ...19, 20. Here I come! Don't you want to play? What's the matter with your glow? Are you sick? Are you homesick? Do you want to go home? Should I open the window for you? If you really want to go, then... I know. You're not homesick at all. You're just tired. That's gotta be it. What else, Bear? Right, Mini-Bunny? Today was a big day after all. Let's get some sleep and tomorrow you'll be all better. Good night, little star. Sweet dreams. And you two: be quiet. Mommy? Mommy! Daddy, where's Mommy? At work! At the opera! I didn't get to give her a goodbye kiss! Mommy? Break a leg! Bye-bye, my darling! Bye-bye! Oh no! Mommy! Mommy, your bow! No! Mommy! Wait! - She's long gone! Laura! Laura, where are you hiding? Are you in your room? Lau... Asleep already? How about a goodnight kiss? No? Fine. Stay under the blanket. Good night. Looks like rain. Oh no, my bow. Huh? Wow. A real flying star! Hello? I think I got lost. It's you! Woah! We're flying! What is that? I must be dreaming! That was awesome, little star! And now to the opera! Go, fast! Or else, we won't make it on time! Cool landing, little star! Wait here for me. I'll be right back. It isn't on the shelf either? It had to happen for my first performance. I"m attached to my old one. It's my lucky bow. Can't you borrow one? - Yeah, whatever. You'll be fine. I'll manage somehow. Bye. That's crazy. Mission accomplished. We're a great team. Are you really tired? Or do you want to fly some loops? I'm telling you: Flying is the best thing ever! Well, when it's not raining anyway... Ugh! Careful! What are you doing? It's not funny! Oh no! Your bandage! No! Laura! Hmm? Hmm... Star? Star! Where are you? Are you in here? This isn't the time to play hide-and-seek. Hey, stop! I think you took my star! Hey, where are you, little star? Star? It's you! Hold on! I'll save you! Oh no. You have to keep glowing. Please! I didn't want this, really. Please, glow again. Laura? Laura, is that you? What are you doing here? I don't know. Looking for you maybe. I found something. Something you lost. I didn't lose anything. Leave me alone. Everything okay? Of course, I'm fine! My star got homesick. Now, it fell out of the sky. If I only had his point... But I lost it, the stupid bandage came off in the rain. Is this what you're looking for? The point! Wait! Wait a sec. So... Please, glow again. Yes! Oh no! What am I to do? Maybe... I have to bring the star home! - Bring him home? Between the sun and the moon? - It showed me. Okay. Hold on tight! Don't be afraid, little star. Everything will be fine. We're almost there. They're gone! No, there! Up there! That's right Laura, let him fly! What's that supposed to be? - It's my star. Your star? But it doesn't glow at all. Pointless to bring it here. Let it go. You believe it can fly. I hope so. - That's nonsense. It'll fall down and shatter, and then you can pick up the pieces. Take it back home. It's happy there. Yes, but... Don't look to us. You are the one who has to decide. Fly, little star. Fly, please! Laura! Up here! My star! Farewell, little star. Take good care of yourself. I will never forget you! Max, your cat. — My cat? It thought it was yours. Look, Laura! Hello, Tommy! - I'm a pilot! And Bear and Mini-Bunny are my co-lipots! Hey Tommy, can we be your passengers? Of course. Me and my co-lipots have plenty of room! Max, your plane flies really great! Hold on tight! Off we go! - Hello, Muschka! Tommy, turn around! Muschka went overboard! Super, Muschka. You're the first space-bandage-catcher cat! Okay, Captain! Everybody back on board! Okay, ready to go. And now back to Earth! Laura? Laura, time to get up. Hmm. Hello, my little angel. Good morning, time to get up. Laura! Good morning, Tommy. Any nice dreams? M-hm, great. Right, Tommy? - Yeah. Good morning, you two. Get up. Get dressed. Get ready! We have a surprise for you. Do you want to go to the countryside and visit your old house this weekend? Look Laura, it flies again! Can we go another weekend? Why? - We just arrived in our new home. THE END
