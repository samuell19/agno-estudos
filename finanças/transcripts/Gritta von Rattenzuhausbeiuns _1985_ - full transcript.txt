Gritta of Ratsinourhome (Narrator) Once upon a time... Yes, once upon a time, 100 or 200 years ago, there was a girl living... in the old ruined castle of the Count of Ratsinourhome. Her name was Gritta. Gritta lived here with her father, the High Count Julius Ortel... and the faithful servant Müffert, who had stayed with them out of pity. The High Count of Ratsinourhome was more and more impoverished. Government was not his strength. But with pleasure he had studied mechanical engineering. In this area he had some successes. He invented an oatmeal cutting machine for the farmers, a speak-far machine, called Bellophone, and a water clock. For 7 years he had been building a throne rescue machine for the king. The king was terrified for his life... and for his throne. That's why he sent word out into the country: Whoever builds a throne rescue machine for him will be well rewarded. - Gebhardt Müffert, wake up! - Is it already morning? No, but the world is getting ready to perish. I'll stay with you tonight. Go back to bed! I'll sleep in the chest. Stately the world is declining. Piglet! ♪ Oh, how is it possible then, that I can leave you? ♪ I love you with all my heart, believe me now ♪ You have captured my heart... ♪ So completely, that I love no other... ♪ but you alone. Wonderfully super! The king is raising the reward for building a throne rescue machine. Listen! Whoever quickly builds a rescue machine for the king will be rewarded... with the 1st class engineering medal and with gemstones... and a bag of gold pieces. Wonderful! Wonderful! The 1st class engineering medal. With gemstones. First eat, Dad! Oat pops again! Dear Müffert, is it oatmeal or oatmeal pudding today? Oat parfait, Mr. High Count! Stately the world is declining. Do we have to eat oats until the end of our lives, Dad? We are not horses! Maybe you'll invent an egg-laying machine or a sausage machine? Possibly. Then the farmers would send me eggs and sausage besides oats. Wonderfully super. This lowlife is too stupid or too lazy to lay eggs! As always I expect you at 9 in my workshop. Majesty! With my throne rescue machine TRM, model 1848, the person sitting on the throne is thrown up in case of danger, by a well-calibrated bow release, so he can escape any danger successfully. Wonderfully super! Wonderful! Don't be afraid! 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. Kuno Gebhardt, you look like a lamp, the way you're hanging there. Wasn't that a great bow release? You, my own noble flesh and blood, are a coward? It's an honor to test a royal throne rescue machine. Jump! - For the honor of your country! - Just get going! Wonderful! Wonderfully super! Most wonderfully super! There's just a bit of built-in safety missing. Maybe a screen, filling up with the light air, could unfold at the back of the flying person? A parachute! Eureka! That's it! A... para... chute. Child, be careful! Hold on tight! Do we have to spend the winter up here, Father? Have some patience! I'll borrow a ladder at the mill. And for that he sold everything: Furniture, lamps, curtains. It's a good thing that the Blessed High Countess... is no longer experiencing the decline of the house. I should look after dad better. Yes! Hello? Hello! I should invent a hello-machine. No, rather a signpost machine. Oh lala! Oh lala! Daddy should have learned better how to govern! I'll never get a husband when I always have bruises. Will the king will reward us too, when this stupid machine is finally finished? Say something! You're always quiet. You never give your opinion. You're poor, you don't receive a wage... and have yourself shot to the ceiling every day. Say something! Poor people must be obedient. God wants it that way. I brought visitors. May I introduce them? My daughter Gritta, the young High Countess. And Kuno Gebhardt Müffert, our faithful servant, cook and bodyguard. Dad, where is the ladder? Please forgive me! I forgot the ladder. You're a loser, a failure, a dead-end! A sad sack, A wash out! A dead beat! Hey! Is that how you speak to your High Count father? The child is somewhat precocious. Her education lost its direction through her mother's early death. She reads too much, rebellious books. Oh, Mon dieu! I inherited the castle from my ancestors. It's already a bit ruined. Ruined castle. Ruined castles are my favorites. Here it doesn't smell like the Count's boredom as it does at home. Gracious beautiful Miss! Do you want to stay here for a few days? Je veux. I want to! I want to! It's only a single one. Wait one more month. Then come get her. Back off, old witch! It's an honor for your goose to come to the King's table. Let her go! Let him go! Or else I'll tell my dad the High Count! The one up there? - She means the High Count Spinnefix. - Oh, give him a nice greeting! - You may remove yourself gracefully! - We're honored, Miss Countess. And to the Lord Papa a fine greeting! All this because I waited so long for you. Why are you so late? Why why! Because for three hours I was hanging from the ceiling. Look at the bruises. And then we had visitors. Who then? Countess Zimtzicke with 100 ribbons and 7 sugared garden gnomes. You're not very nice today. Why should I? They stole 3 geese. The miller will beat me. - Are you afraid of the miller? - Yes. Coward! Many kinds of dishes only spoil the stomach. C'est une délicatesse délicieuse. A tasty delicacy. Oats not only strengthen, but also heal and aid growth. Simple dishes do taste best. Attention! ♪ Under the moonlight, My dear friend Pierrot, ♪ Lend to me your pen so I can write a word. ♪ My candle is dead I have no more light ♪ Open for me your doorway for the sake of God. ♪ Au clair de la lune, Pierrot répondit ♪ Je n'ai pas de plume, Je suis dans mon lit. ♪ Va chez la voisine, je crois qu'elle y est, ♪ Car dans sa cuisine On bat le briquet. ♪ Au clair de la lune, L'aimable Lubin ♪ Frappe chez la brune, Elle repond soudain: ♪ Qui frappe de la sorte? Il dit à son tour: ♪ Ouvrez votre porte pour le dieu d'amour! ♪ Au clair de la lune, On n'y voit qu'un peu. ♪ On chercha la plume... A cat! Bring cats into the castle right now! The rats must go! Or I'll stay no longer. Hey! What are you doing here? I am no longer with the miller. She drove me out. Well, come with me! I want! I want! I want! Hey, that's fithy! Careful! - I'm scrubbing the stairs, father. - Good, good. No way! That's your upbringing! It's time that she learn embroidery, spinning and weaving. For you. Our new tower horn player. - Do you notice something? - Yes. - What? - It tickles like ants. Me too. To the tip of my nose. Now clear to my toe tips. Do you love me? - Then you have to prove it. - How? When you're in love, you'll do everything for your beloved. - Everything! - Yes, everything! So eat, as proof of love for me, a stinging nettle! Bravo, my brave knight! You've passed the first acid test. And now the second one. Fly with my fly-bike, as proof of love, over this valley. Fly, brave knight! Fly! Higher! Higher! My brave knight! You have passed the 2nd acid test. But you will receive the reward only after the third one. Lovers, kiss each other! On the mouth, that's healthy. You stupid sugared garden gnomes, you plush-ears! Quit! Finished! Go walk on the tower! And you, Gritta, to the spinning wheel! It's going to change. Much will change here. And my dad has a crush on this silly old bat. Since she's come here, everything is different. She yells and I have to jump. I think Dad doesn't love me anymore. If this goes on, I'll take off. I don't care what Dad will do. Say something! You're like Muffert. "We have to be obedient, God wants it that way." One can't change the world with you either. Children can't change the world. We know too little about it. Maybe that's why. The adults are already used to everything. Also to the bad and evil. If you can't find the countess, I'll have you locked up. She was promised to me, the Governor of the king. - She was promised. - Yes, promised. I'll get her. We'll bring her back. We'll search all over the country. But give us time! You'll guarantee with your assets. With our assets. Lock the gate! They want to kidnap me! Lock the gate! Arm yourselves! The court, appointed by the Benevolent Council, 2 guardians, demands to talk to the Countess Nesselkrautia Anna Bolena. I'll only speak through the door! We order you to travel immediately with us, your master guardians, to the castle, designated for you. And to stay there until you are of age. And to do only what we guardians approve. I don't want to! If Countess Anna Bolena Maria does not turn herself over... then she, and everyone who keeps her from doing her duty, will be punished by us, her guardians. That's an order! And this whole ratty castle will be smoked out. Would you have the goodness to disappear? You monsters! Do you really think I'll be marrying him? Be a good child and follow us! - I won't even think of it! - She likes it here! - That might suit you! - She is a minor! That does not matter. This fiend! - This is illegal! - Phooey! - Phooey! - Double phooey! - This disgrace! - A fraud! You only want my money. That's why I'm supposed to marry him. If I refuse, they'll put me in the convent and collect my inheritance. - She's my bride! - Pooh! Here is my fortune, my father's will. Only 3 months left. Then I'm of age. And rich, rich! And then I want the count. I want! - He seduced her! - He'll answer for that! (Parrot) fire! Fire! Fire! I'll get you for this! Hooray! Baron Julius Ortel of Ratsinourhome. Do you want this maiden: Nesselkrautia Anna Bolena Maria, ss your other half and Mistress. Then say a clear yes! Then say a clear yes! Yes. Yes. Yes! Get out! Gritta, sit straight! Straighten your back more. Gritta, chin higher! And how am I supposed to see my dumplings now? You don't have to see them. You know that they are oat dumplings. There has never been anything else at your father's. My love! I will complete the throne rescue machine. The king will reward me. I'll be rich! Rich, rich, rich! Mon dieu, you and rich! Better take care of your daughter! She doesn't embroider, doesn't spin. Instead she reads books. And chooses this no-good for confident. Peter isn't a no-good! You don't get to order me around. - How you do talk to your mother! - You're only 4 years older than me! So shut your yap! Eat properly, child! It's your wild education. That's over now. From now on the child will be educated in a convent school. This is my last word. Vraiement. You slimy stupid cow! Gritta! Child, look! You're already a big girl! Come to the point, dad! I know, you've always been diligent, you've learned, read a lot of books. Rebellious books. But it was free, undisciplined, wild. That wasn't an education, Gritta! That's why it's good when you finally go a to school. A convent school. - Look... - You love only her! Yes, I'll go. Because I love you. - We'll take you there. - No, I want to go alone. But Gritta, child, that's not possible! Yes, dad. When I go, I'm going alone. And now please leave me! - You'll forget me. - Not in my life. - Shall I bring you? - No, I'm going alone. Stay with my father, that old fool. Take care of him when I'm gone. The little High Countess of Ratsinourhome. Come, child! - What's wrong? - What's wrong? You're in a convent. - How come you're in my bed? - I can ask you that, too. The old biddies save on everything. Not even a bed for yourself. Where does she come from? I hatched her tonight. I found the egg in the garden. Does she have feathers? Don't push like that! One, two, three! Now we've baptized you. High heavenly mother! Look up from your glory, be mild and gracious to us. Be our guardian in the dangers of life... through all time. Glory be to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. For ever and forever. Amen. It is sinful to look at yourself in the window glass. You should never do it again! Pray for punishment 3 Lord's Prayer! ♪ I don't like eating barley, And don't like rising early. ♪ I should become a little man, but have no love for that. ♪ So I wish bad luck to them, who want to take this poor girl, ♪ me, to the convent. ♪ The habit as it's cut, Is way too long for me. ♪ They cut off my hair short. It scares and frightens me. ♪ So I wish them that... Hush! Yes, they're sleeping alright. Good night. Sweet. What are you dreaming about? You're at your machine all night while the rats are tormenting me. I have to think a lot about my daughter. Then hurry up with your rescue machine! If only I could find Gritta! And get the rats out of the house! - Here we lie in the dust before you, God Zebaoth. - Read louder! Here we're in the dust before you, God Zebaoth. Why do we have to? Because he made us out of dust and we'll be dust again. As punishment for our vanity. - God should treat us better. - Oh, you nasty kid! How can you have such impure thoughts! As punishment you go to the chapel. Pray for an hour, but on your knees! Soon we'll all be that scared. We've got to get away from here. Pst! Hush! I'm coming tonight. There's important stuff to report. I gave bacon to a rat, so it will eat the count's last will. Okay. But come through the chimney! Do I have to crawl like a secret lover to his sweetheart? If he sneaks into the convent as a fake priest, he must. Was the rat already there? Damned fireplace! You burn your feet. - Did you accomplish your mission? - I ate the will. Unfortunately it was just paper. But the finest, fat parchment. Now the Countess is as poor as a mouse. - All money goes to the convent. I'll take care of that. - Good. That's the punishment because she expelled Gritta. Is she still alive? Nonsense! Take the reward and leave! Get lost already! We've done it. You have done a good job. And if you don't succeed in becoming king yourself? I'll deal with the king. I also have the prince in the bag. Here's some signatures. I persuaded some parents to leave their lambs in the convent forever. That brings many gold pieces. Margarethe and Camilla. And Petrina. Eslida... - I get half of the money. - ...and little Hermina. - I get half of the money. - Yes, yes, you dirty rascal! - Stop! Who's there? - I had to go. Go to bed and sleep! - Get up! We have to go! - Go? Hurry up! I know a way. Crawl to the door, open it carefully. I'll wake the others. Margaritha, Wild Berry, Camilla, Petrina, Reside, Hermina. Run up to the wall! We'll meet there. Come on, hurry up! Ouch! Come on! Hurry up! Run as fast as you can! So we have a head start. Do we have them for breakfast? Look! Here come the nuns. Fast! Lie down again! No sound! Come! We have to go on. - I can't go on. - You gotta! If they catch us, they'll put us in the convent forever. Get up! Breakfast! We'll stay here. And there we'll live. When we'll have chickens and eggs and pots. And little lambs and goats. Hopefully they won't find us. I have some more! A lion! Here comes a savage! We deign to be kind to you. Go ahead! Kneel before me! That's fit and proper. Never in my life! What do you want here? I am Prince Bonus. You have to rejoice and applaud. Come on! And if I don't rejoice? Then I must have you punished. All subjects must rejoice when the king shows himself to the people. His Highness, Prince Bohne (Bean)! Why are you wearing your head on a platter? This is my neck collar. I have to change it twice a day. My name isn't Prince Bohne, but Prince Bonus. His name isn't Prince Bohne but Prince Bonus. I'm very disappointed that you didn't recognize me. In the country everyone else knows me. I have to show myself daily to my people. So that I learn how to rule it. Don't you here read a newspaper? My picture is on the second page every day, right after the king. His picture is on the second page every day, just after the king. We can't afford a newspaper. We'd rather hear what the sparrows chirp from the rooftops. I like it here. One sits in the green lovelier than on the golden throne. - I have to test-sit every day. - You're a bit stupid, Prince Bonus. Yeah, yeah. You get used to it. I could find lamp light more beautiful than the sun. And the noise of wigs and dresses prettier than the rustle of trees. I'd gladly stay with you. What's your name? I like you. Gritta. You can stay. But you'll have to work. Chop wood or thatch the roof. I'd like to do that for you. But I have to ask Governor Pekavus how many collars I need. And how many jackets and silk boots. Don't ask him. He's dangerous and evil. He is boring and stupid. I heard myself that he wants to harm you and the king. He just wants your money and the throne. I don't believe that. Maybe I can help you? My dad has a throne rescue machine. And when you join in... So here's the throne-inheriting head! Run away! Hurry up! Beggar children! Blabbing rabble I've been hunting for a long time. Governor Pekavus! I order you not to offend my friends! Apologize! Accursed brandy guzzler! Now you stop at once! Stop! Or I'll tell the king that you want to murder me. You haven't done that in vain, my prince! And you... I'll put you in jail as vagrants. Forever! You won't escape me any more! If my father doesn't believe me? You have to help me! How do I get into the city without toll money? Come to the tower at the city wall. I let a basket down there every Monday night. You get in it and you'll be with me. Come soon, my little forest maiden! We can't stay here. We'll look for another place to stay. No, Pekavus will catch us and lock us up. Margaretha, you're the oldest and you know the roads. Take Hermina and the others home. I've been longing for home for a long time. Me too. Gritta, where have you been? We searched everywhere. Then we scolded your stepmother and drove the stupid pages away. - I was in a convent. - You were in a convent? He didn't tell me that, greedy Governor Pekavus. Deceit! I'll pay him back, with tweaks and twitches. Pekavus is dangerous. We'd better do that together. Let's go! Let's go! - First I have to find my dad. - I know where he is. I'll take you to him. But don't let him see me because he's angry with me. Daddy! Daddy! Wonderful! Wonderfully super! Daddy! What are you doing up there? This is the contact reception with the moon dwellers. Yesterday I saw a little man on the moon. He waved a flag. When we get in touch with the moon dwellers, I'll become the most famous man in the world. My little daughter! My Highly Gracious Little Daughter! Anna Bolena, Peter! Come and see who we have here! Do you like your little brother? Here. We were worried about you. When we learned that you were no longer in the convent, we got worried. Do you have your throne rescue machine ready? She's ready. With parachute. Do you want to try it? No, not today. But we'll need it soon. For the king. I built it for him. But I can't get to the king. Pekavus demands 20 gold pieces for entry into the city. We're now selling wooden spoons and whisks in the village, so we can earn some money. I'll take you into the city. I already know how. We only have to wait a few more days. Until Monday. ♪ To Seville!

Hide yourself! I'll get you soon. How nice that you came, my little forest maiden. I thought about us, terribly long. It hurt plenty in my head. I came to the following decision: You'll stay here in the tower until I'm king. Then you'll be my queen. Don't be absurd! I'm here to expose Pekavus. And to bring the throne rescue machine to the king. Did you see a rat with an earring? A rat? Why a rat? What is that? I have to go to the royal supper. See you soon. And I'll bring you some fine food. Don't forget! I am glad, my son, to finally see you smile again. Oh, I don't feel good! May I be excused? You stay here! Quit that! Ouch! I'm a servant. Because the prince can't come, he sends me. With a greeting and a gingerbread. Does one serve a cookie to a lady from a cupped hand? He's quite a pig. If his king only knew! King Gänserich has really fat servants. But since he's here, he can get me a fur out of the closet. Because in this castle it's not only boring, but also freezing cold. Who are you, beautiful child? I'll tell you when you bring the fur. Go on! One. Two. Three, four. Five. Open the door immediately! I'm the king! Your king! I already know that. I'm not stupid. Open up immediately! Or I'll have you tarred and feathered! Where's the guard? Help! Only someone who does wrong screams so loudly. Wrong? I don't know anything about that. Open up! You know nothing? Everyone in the country knows it. You won't get out until you promise something. I don't think about promising something to a child. Then you're king in the closet now. The dust will cover you. The woodworm is your hourglass. - Your bones will be found in 100 years. - What do I have to promise? First, open the city gates, so that anyone can go through without money. Second, stop the goose tax for the poor people. You don't understand their need. If I stop the goose tax, I won't have any more goose pate. Thirdly you should punish Pekavus. He is a swindler and cheater. That's not true. Slander. It's nowhere in the national newspapers. It IS true! Just wait! When I come out, you nasty child! You won't come out without promises. Too bad! Now my dad waits in vain with the throne rescue machine in front of the gate. A throne rescue machine, you say? Open up! I promise you everything for this machine. It's about time. Else I would have thrown the key out of the window. You don't promise anything, Tubby! Now I have the key. I'll also get the throne rescue machine. And you can eat woodworms. Is that you? Governor Pekavus? How dare you! King Pekavus! Now I am the king! - It's over! - Ouch! Gritta, don't worry! We'll get you out, but you have to be patient. Where is Gritta? She'll be somewhere, your Gritta. What's wrong now? Is it that scoundrel again? That crook? Good that you finally understand. Now be quiet, don't move! Otherwise a rat will eat your fat goose belly. Rats? No! No! - Please, no rats! No! - Oh, shut up! Highly Honored Majesty! My invention is... this throne rescue machine, called TRM, model 1848. The person on the throne at the moment of greatest danger... will be thrown from the endangered "throne"... by a well-calculated, gentle bow release. Secured by a security parachute. The machine corresponds to the latest state-of-the-art technology. I tested it successfully for many years... - on many people and animals. - Good, good! Tell me how that thing works! Your Majesty, that's not how it works. That won't work. That's wonderful! I'll rule by lightning and thunder. Kneel before me! Stooooooop!! Stop! Come back immediately! This is my machine! You! Now he's gone! Damn it! Now I'll probably have to govern alone. Child! I'll install you in my cabinet. As first female adviser. Nobody needs to be scared anymore. I'll order everyone to get along with each other. If one is mean, then... Let's have a party! Geese, er music! Your Majesty is already back? And without a parachute? Child, this is my best day. Once I'm the king, then you're my queen. Ouch! Leave it! I won't consider marrying so soon. And certainly not such a velvet and silk guy. ♪ Blue is a little flower ♪ It's called forget-me-not. ♪ This little flower is close to my heart... ♪ And... ♪ think of me!
