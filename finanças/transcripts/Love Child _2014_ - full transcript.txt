What are you here for? I'm here because my baby died. When and where did the baby die? Last week at my home. Okay, what's' your occupation? I don't have a job. - What's your baby's name? - It's Sarang. Do you know the exact time when your baby died? I assume around 5 AM. Why do you think so? Because we came home after then. Where did you go? - We were at the PC room. - At the PC room. You left the 3-month-old baby alone at home... played a game all night long at PC game room... and came back at 5 in the morning? - No, we came back at 7 - AM. At 7? For how long did you play the computer game? Over 10 hours I think. What caused your baby's death do you think? I'm not sure. She was a premature baby from the beginning. It's been 24 years since I became a police officer. And 16 years a detective. I've seen many extreme cases... but this case in particular is very meaningful to me. Well, I... I also am a father. I felt sympathy for them. This is the first such crime in Korea. The family hopes people... will forget about this tragic event. So that they could just live a quiet life. I'll never forget. They did not want to notify us of the baby's death at first. So they looked up the funeral process online. They found out that they had to call the police... They called 911 and notified us... that their child was dead. When we arrived at the scene, the baby was in the basement. The basement was very messy... and the baby was dead. It was terrible. Yes, I was there. It was a shocking scene. The baby was just lying straight. The baby was lying down on the blanket. It was a horrifc scene. She was covered with the bed cloth up to her chest. She seemed to be extremely underweight... compared to other babies. Our team members were suspicious of the relationship... between the parent and child. A typical parent would weep in this situation... but they showed no emotion. None of us believed it at first. It was unbelievable... that they left their child alone at home... and played online games for 6-12 hours. PC ROOM I've been working here for years. People come and go, some regular... some drifting through. I check them in and out of their computers. They pay for their time. I started playing online games in the 4th grade. That's when I first started playing games. I had played the game... all the way from then through high school... and made friends with many people in the game. Like you talked about the community spirit before... Koreans like to gather in one place. And the place of gathering became PC game rooms. PC game rooms started appearing... when network games were first introduced. It was too expensive to install high-speed Internet at homes... so people installed many computers collectively. The reason the number of PC Bangs grew so fast... is related to the explosion of online gaming in Korea. Another cause is the government policy in the early 1990s... to aggressively increase... the number of Internet connections. Two officers felt suspicious... about the extreme thinness of the baby... and asked for an official autopsy. The cause of death turned out to be malnutrition. I was very depressed when the autopsy result... proved that she died of hunger. Letting a baby starve to death today... doesn't make sense at all. After all, we're living in the 21st century. It was really sad. Suwon Seobu Police Station requested an arrest warrant... for the 41-year-old Kim and his wife. We had to release them for about 15 days... while waiting for the autopsy results... and they ran away during that process. The Kim couple has escaped. The address on their ID card was wrong as well. Then they grew careless... believing that we finally quit chasing. We continued on tracking them... until I think it was February 10th, 2010. They hid themselves in Yangju, where their parents were living. The neighborhood was very isolated... with only two to three apartment buildings. It was so secluded from other villages... that you couldn't get there without GPS. When we went there... to arrest the parents... they already knew who we were. They did not resist. They seemed resigned. They said they had realized... they could no longer hide from us. A young couple was arrested... for starving their 3-month-old daughter to death. I hope that she's happy... forever in heaven... and I feel sorry as a dad. I remember they said... they actually met inside a game. NEXON GAME DESIGN HEADQUARTERS They were playing the fantasy game Prius. In role-playing games, as opposed to strategy games... you create a character of your own. You create an avatar as you start the game... choose its personality. The avatars in Prius are diverse. Yes, they're robots, knights, and wizards... There are so many. The biggest reason... that people were attracted to this game... was "Anima", a mini avatar. If you reach level 10 to 15 you are given a quest... if you complete the quest, you are also given an Anima. Player has reached level 10 and earned the "Anima Quest"... Animas are given to everyone, and they are very small. Those small dudes follow you all the time. The personalities of Anima... changes based on the interactions... it has with the player. This personality can turn into a defensive type, critical type. The Anima is the central key to this game. The woman's parents disapproved of the relationship. Since the man did not have a regular job... and their age gap was quite big. Her parents didn't believe them when they said... they were making money in the game. Anima has reached level 81 and casts a protection spell! Anima has reached level 81 and casts a protection spell! Through many hours of playing the game... it's possible to earn enough virtual money... to trade for real money. They sold the virtual money to those to buy game items... without investing the time it takes to earn them. Some call it 'Gold Farming' and as far as I could tell... this was the only way the couple earned income. It was illegal when I was in elementary school. But the trade became legal when I was in middle school. From then, I did legal trades with strangers online. Korea's MMORPG games today enable users to decorate... their avatars by charging the game cash... so called 'cash avatars'. Last year, Korea exported around 4.2 billion dollars... of cultural contents... and 50% of them were from the gaming industry. While global IT transactions fell 4.6%... Korea's IT industry grew 5.3% last year. This means the upturn has been for two years now. The Internet economy in South Korea... is worth $7.9 billion. It makes up almost 7% of the GDP. I didn't even know that she was pregnant. They were here all the time... so I never looked closely at them. They would come in after dinner and play all night. They were so happy lost in this game together. I found the mother's medical records... stating she'd never been to the hospital during her pregnancy. Not until she was about to come due. Not even once. She didn't have a vaccination or receive an examination. She didn't receive any prenatal care. She wasn't being responsible as a mother. Both of the parents were small and skinny... especially the husband... and the baby was born underweight. They probably thought it was normal. I feel very bad... because she did not know how to raise a child at all. She bore a baby... but was completely ignorant of why she was crying... or when to feed her. The couple had very limited knowledge... on how to raise a baby compared to average parents. To make matters worse... the couple was busy playing online games... rather than taking care of their own baby. Quest 508, Level 91 Sacrifice of Star... Their family accused them of spending too much time... playing games. This is why the couple... had to move out with their child. Player has earned enough points to revive Anima! The couple didn't realize that the baby... would starve to death. Therefore, they had no intent to murder their baby... and the child died of neglect. Government Prosecutors agreed and charged the defendants... with involuntary manslaughter... instead of a full out murder charge. The couple confessed the crime during the first hearing. There were about 3 hearings. With their confession in hand... the second hearing was an investigation of the charges... analyzing the reason and circumstances... that led to the child's death. There were strands of hair inside the bottle... the hair was mixed with the rotten milk... and the bottle was placed at his bedside. I think they fed the baby with the rotten milk. The photos of the bottle were used as evidence. We checked the log in history at PC Game Room... every time they came, they stayed for at least six hours. They came after the baby was asleep at night. The first reason this case is so unfortunate... was they actually were trying to save money. Instead of paying at an hourly rate... they paid for blocks of time at a discount. This allowed them to save some money. They played games for 10 hours at the price of 7 hours. During interrogation they said... they had deliberately chosen that location... for the special deal. If she were to wake up... there was nobody to take care of the baby. I think these things prove that they were... different from normal people. CHUNG ANG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL So the next step was to identify the motivation... and the reason behind the couple's behavior. I am going to show you several images. Please look at them and answer my questions. What does this look like? We hired a psychiatrist so that the arrested couple... may receive adequate treatment and counseling. Anything else you see here? What is missing here? A shadow of a person. This one? Do you usually spend your free time playing games? Then... is there another purpose for playing games? Then, you've been playing games for money... financial purposes... extra income. Have you ever thought... you were unable to control yourself? For some people who suffer from boredom... lose vigor, become depressed... video games provide the only comfort. They play games because they have nothing else to do. They barely eat and barely go out. They become like a hermit. They don't have a supportive environment. But video games reward the users. The results from the diagnosis... suggest the defendants have reached the threshold... for online game addiction. Because they have been confined to this virtual world for so long... they were incapable of distinguishing... between the virtual and the real. They had become emotionless because of online game addiction. There is a passage in the Korean Law... which protects the physically and mentally ill criminals... by reducing the severity of their sentences. For example, if a man commits a crime under intoxication... whatever his intention may have been... his sentence could be reduced. There is still controversy around whether the law... should include online addiction... in the category of mentally and physically ill. As I've stated in my case, since the cause... of the baby's accidental death... is classified as "Online Addiction"... under the Korean law, which mandates protection... for the mentally ill, a reduction of sentence time... for the defendant is reasonable. Yes, I as far as I'm aware this is the first case... where game addiction caused a fatality. When I met the patients... I got a lot of questions... from a lot of the press and TV programs. The question is always the same... Is the brain of a patient with game addiction... the same to the brain of the patient with substance addictions? I say yes or no. It's obviously a big social issue that a child dies of hunger... because her parents are addicted to a computer game. The couple said that they quit playing the online games... because they felt guilty at losing their child. But it was too late, it seems they will have to go to jail. She secretly gave birth to a baby... in a PC Bang toilet stall, and suffocated the baby... with a plastic bag. The homeless woman roamed around the streets... and was addicted to online gaming. She started to have contractions and went to the public restroom... to give birth to a child. Yes, it is even worse than drinking. You could go to bed after being drunk... but games excite your curiosity since they always... have new scenarios and stories. Because excessive game playing has recently become an issue... a couple laws were passed. One is Juvenile Protection Act... and this act prohibits juveniles... under the age of 16 from playing games... from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. This is also known as "Shutdown Law". As a result, game companies stopped catering for children... under 15 years of age, distorting the market. Once, our gaming industry... created authentic products autonomously. We must recognize that the problems... caused by new media are solved in increments... under implicit social agreements... rather than government intervention. A game addiction is a result of many other factors... than just the game itself. Instead of making strict regulations on gaming... it is important for all of us to think more carefully... about this issue and to come up with a remedy. At first, we show a therapy video for relaxation... which consists of scenes of nature, for 10 minutes. The patient gets to watch a gaming video... and then a video that makes him or her feel aversion. Relaxing, showing a gaming video... and then an aversive video. This makes the patient... have a more negative attitude toward games. This form of behavioral therapy is very effective. The 'avatar' has a lot of meanings... The original meaning of avatar is like him, himself, right? But in the online world... the "avatar" is "a version of me", "but I"... a very complicated meaning the "avatar" has. Our reality never allows us to be a different person... but role-playing games enable us to switch roles. Through these experiences... we could understand each other more. I think that serious games are functional... and meaningful enough if they enable people... to gain not only information and knowledge, but also empathy. Actually, most of the people here enjoy playing games. We usually made a joke about that. We wouldn't be able to understand... the game addict patients without playing ourselves. Therefore we all started playing games at first. I personally enjoy playing games as well... and I once tried to be addicted to it on purpose. Then I could understand why people gain pleasure. It made me keep thinking of the games in my real life. It's not exactly like I wanted to play the game... but the scenes and images... kept coming across my mind. Yes, I dreamed about those games. Not only that... I personally wished that the real world were a game... not an addiction though. - I think that's an addiction. - Is it? As smartphones were introduced... time and space are no longer limited. You could get access to games... whenever and wherever you want... and it became easier for you to play games. You could play games whenever and wherever. I think this rise of mobility... is a natural consequence of technology. Gamers use smartphones as a mobile gaming console. Now the gaming environment is expanding. Why do I need to distinguish 'reality' from virtual reality? If I'm happy with living a life... in between the real world and the virtual world... Why would I have to draw a distinction between them? Playing games is no longer simple... but it's becoming more active and pervasive. I think that the mixed reality provides a better environment... for people to be more active... The virtual reality reflects the real life... and these two realities become mixed together. They see as unnecessary... drawing a distinction between these two worlds. Real world and virtual world become part of the same world. They seem to be happier that way... and we believe that the mixed world... brings us comfort, varieties, and joy. This cannot be considered addiction. We used the term "game addiction"... and the court acknowledged the use of the word. We were very pleased that they did so. The court then decided... to pass a less severe punishment to the couple. This case established a legal precedent. It had a tremendous impact in Korean legal system. Recently legislators introduced a controversial bill... that aims to include and manage online gaming... as one of the 'big 4' additions on top of alcohol... gambling and drugs. Why would the government take such action... that is so clearly detrimental to the gaming industry? This must be addressed as a medical issue. This bill is all about treating... and preventing losses incurred by game addiction. If we categorize online games... as a potentially addictive activity... the public perception of online gaming culture... would deteriorate. Addiction inducing activities such as drinking, gambling... drugs and online games. We can't ignore this when we think of our children. Is it appropriate... to include online game addiction... among alcohol, drugs and gambling? Some people with high-level education... might argue that we need to take a medical approach... to this case because the parents were mentally ill. But in reality, this is a very complicated situation. How could you think that... because these people are addicted to Internet games... the priority at this point... is offering them treatment at a clinic... when you see the baby starved to death right in front of you? It's a basic responsibility as a human... to feed her own baby. It's not something to be taught. Humans need food to survive. Giving birth to a child, fostering her, giving her milk... embracing her, and loving her... are all natural human inclinations. She must have suffered so much. These kids... Emotions are not supposed... to be involved in cases... but it's difficult because we are also humans. We would become a machine if we ignored our feelings. How ironic it is that her name is "Love". The parents promised that such accident... wouldn't happen again to their second child. The parents are deeply sorry for their actions... and are seeking redemption. They are asking advice to a lot of people... and want to successfully raise a child. I know that... They made an official announcement in court... and they also promised me that they will never play games. I'm glad they have received treatment... and especially that they were able to get a second chance. I was happy for them when I heard... that they were having a second child. Whatever they did... I know they wanted to be good parents. I know they have more love to give. After the trial, I asked my doctor... if I too was an online addict. He laughed and said... "How does a fish know it's in water?"
