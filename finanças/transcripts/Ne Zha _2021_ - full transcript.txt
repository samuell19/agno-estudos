Welcome to the first race of the Asian super professional league for this season this season we will have 6 races the team with the highest points after 6 races will be the annual league champion most people still put their focus on wolves racing especially their young champion jet sung jet sung used to drive for lions racing alongside "the king" Jeffery Lee the once glorious lions racing went downhill after its founder father shen "the crazy one" passed away. Hello Jeffery they haven't won a single race for years. Excuse me. Jet sung, will you take the job endorsing that car brand? When it comes to endorsement, we should ask the man over here. Jeffery Jeffery is much more professional than I am. He already started endorsing sanitary pads. You can ask him how it feels when using the product. What pads? A shen why are you taking other sponsorships without our consent? Now there is a pad brand on Jeffery's car! You got to be kidding! Mr. Wang, Mr. Wang! Don't be mad. That pad comes from the sponsors of lili lu she is the champion of the gokart league domestically. Karting? Isn't that for kids? Mr. Wang, to be honest, I don't really want to have her. But my father already signed with her a while ago. There will be no more sponsorship from now on. Lions racing is done anyway. Keep your pads. Many old fans of lions are worried about the situation. We may not see them defeat wolves racing and get back their glory anytime soon. Hey! Lili, what's your starting position? Seventh it's alright. Listen, squeeze yourself to the front. Then follow my lead. I'm gonna give the wolves a reason to stop laughing today. With their speed during the qualifying session this morning. Wolves racing has shown absolute dominance jet sung is at the pole position with his teammate kojiro sawa in second and the three time champion Jeffery Lee "the king" is in third position with his new teammate lili lu in seventh. "The king" Jeffery Lee was invincible until jet sung joined the race but you have to admit, jet has shown greater talent. Father shen used to dominate this league with lions, now after he's gone, all the pressure of taking another championship for lions falls onto Jeffery's shoulders. But there's still some exciting news for lions that is Jeffery Lee's teammate lili lu lili, follow the orders from Jeffery when the race starts find a way to help Jeffery. You already said it a hundred times. She is the first female professional driver in this league. Once a gokart champion, father shen trained her from the beginning of her career. We don't know if she can handle the pressure of this intense race yet after jet sung left the team, father shen's son a shen has always been looking for a good teammate for Jeffery Lee. If Jeffery Lee would like to settle his competition with jet sung before his retirement. Lili might be his last chance ok! It's about time for the starting lights, Asian super professional racing league is ready to begin! Car no.4, lili lu is off to a good start she just passed shiao Jen driving for bunnies and machi for snakes and she just keeps over taking the other drivers, getting into a better position. Hard to imagine she can put that much pressure on her opponents in her first race. Now all of a sudden, she's behind her teammate Jeffery Lee already this reminds us of the first race jet sung did for lions it looks like the king has a good teammate this year. Will the classic sling shot tactics from lions be performed here again? If the two lions can work together this year they might have a chance to challenge wolves for the title. But it seems machi from snakes is not done yet. He prepares to attack with the advantage of their engines. Lili lu successfully blocks machi's attack for Jeffery Lee. Jeffery Lee suddenly slows down! Jeffery? What happened to Jeffery? A shen, there is a problem with fourth gear again. There might be a mechanical issue with Jeffery's car. The two wolves are getting away and machi from snakes is preparing for another attack lili, block machi for me for another lap it takes both of our cars to do the sling shot later. Uh Jet is making an even bigger gap now... How about we let lili take a shot? There is a chance with her current speed. What are you talking about? Nevermind. We will be both overtaken by snakes. Block the line when I tell you to. Screw that. Wow, lili lu is preparing to take over Jeffery Lee she is on the outside and there is no sign that Jeffery Lee is giving her the line is this going to be another round of infighting within lions? Lili, get out of my way! Two lions are fighting for turn 17 inside, Jeffery Lee is getting back his speed. Preparing to fight for the third position. He is wheel to wheel with lilil from the inside! Get out of my way. If lili lu stays on the outside and doesn't back off they will crash into each other. Lili lu backs off! Car no.4 loses control! Lili, take your hands off the wheel! Shit. Uh, hello everyone, I'm Jack tu hello, I'm Jack tu. Shh, not good hi, I'm Jack tu. During the game magazine's interview, they asked a question I never thought about before "why do you want to race?" I don't know how I should answer that. They say I am a genius at the race simulator. Actually I'm not that great. You are now the world champion the really good professional driver, is my high school classmate lili lu Shoot, how come there is still someone in the elevator at this hour. I'll act natural. Where was I? Oh, this is super tofu, I built it. I have a mission with super tofu today. This might change the history of street racing Based on the results from the simulator. I'll have an 84% chance to win today. Which means, I might be able to beat the legendary driver of street racing, showy. I heard that he never lost a race. Super tofu and I will become the new legend. Sorry, showy. He is coming over this way? Are you a pro? What should I do? How should I answer him? That visor is so dark. Can you really see the road? Oh, right, it's seems to be a little too dark. Hey, he is ignoring showy. Wait a minute, should I come another day? Calm down. 84%. I'll be fine. We have done this on the simulator a few dozen times. Slip the clutch. 4 cylinders direct fuel injection. 6500rpm, next gear, full throttle, all the way. 30 meters before the corner, downshift the gear, brake, come on, super tofu, super turn! Ah!! What the... I told you it's too dark. Come, take it off. He hit the brake too late. Who is he? Never seen him before. Ok, let's do this all over again. Hi, I'm Jack tu. I heard that someone challenged showy and failed. That wasn't me. I was in Japan taking a test for formula racing. The driver who won was so good. I only got second place. Alright, this is not real. Nobody cares anyway. Let's see who left a comment. Yes! How was her first professional race? How did this happen? This looks serious. Kevin, I already sent you the modified plans take a look at it. See if there is still anything we need to adjust. Let me know if there is anything. Thank you. What's the situation with your hand now? Fracture in my wrist. The doctor says it will take three months. Yes fey, give those flowers to papa. Papa. Na Fey Thank you. Get well soon. Let me put this aside for you. Are you going to apologize? If you listened to me, it wouldn't be like this if you let me pass, we would be on the podium. I was faster than you, and in better position. It's alright if you don't wanna apologize. Tell me, why should I apologize? Fey let's go find a vase for the flowers, shall we? Come on. I already talked to lili's sponsor. Because of the injury to her hand, they are going to terminate the sponsorship. It doesn't matter to me. It will be enough with just me out there. With our financial situation, it's tight even with only keeping one car going. So, what are you going to do? Don't forget, my sponsor left because of the pads. Your sponsor left, because you are past your prime. You didn't even finish one professional race yet. Do you know how many I've finished? Alright, let's not fight about that here. Listen to me. What if I bring in the genius of race simulation to be trained by Jeffery Lee "the king" then put him in a professional race. Don't you think this is very newsworthy? At this moment, there is already a game company that agreed to this. They are very keen to be the sponsor. Great you want to put a gamer into the lions team is there anything stupider than this? At least, their funding will let you, "the king" have one more race. You should help me race properly, that's the basics. A shen you don't take professional racing seriously enough. I know it's just a gimmick. I know you don't like it. Who knows that normal guys can't drive a professional race car but at least a sponsor is interested. I can only take it one day at a time. What if the gamer has experience in formula racing. That would be different, right? (Are you all right?) (I hope you get well soon) (Can I meet you?) You are the champion of the race simulator, right? You are so good. (We need sponsorship from gaming companies.) (In fact, it is not easy for the average player to drive a professional race car.) (But you're trained in formulae and you're a master of the simulator) (This is a rider to rider request, is that ok?) Based on this plan, we have found many race simulator experts. In one week, we will pick the driver with the most potential, to join the second race of aspl as long as the driver can finish the race, it will definitely bring some attention. (Jack tu) (Are you here?) (I'm sorry, I didn't even drive the formula.) Jack tu Long time no see uh Wait a minute. Jack tu This is so cool feels like driving a real race car. Ye... yeah hey. I'm fine. Let's go. Go? Where? This should not be a problem for you. Uh, lili, actually, I'm very willing to help, but in reality, I... I know you are busy, but we really need you. He is my friend, ranking no. 1 in the world on race simulators Jack tu. It's my honor. Nice to meet you. Luckily, he didn't make it for the test of formula racing in suzuka so he can be here. Oh, when should you hit the brake at the end of the straight at suzuka? 80 meters I can make it at 65. He is my teammate. "The king" Jeffery Lee nice to meet you. Jack tu be careful no pressure. Hey I'm very curious. If you can hit the brake so late and still make the turn. Why didn't they pick you. Get in How was it? Is there a problem with the car? Hey hey hey, Jack Wow, what the hell? Are you alright? In fact, I've got other things to do. I suggest that you find another driver. That's all. Bye! Hey! Just two more laps. Young man. It's alright to take it slow at the beginning. Lili is watching. How can I, the genius of the racing simulator, make myself look bad here. Did you see how he made the turn? It seems like he will be fine if you can make him feel less nervous. Let's talk again after he can actually finish a lap in the lions car What is the temperature? Hey you've been training twice as hard as jet sung that should be enough. I'm fighting two wolves alone. What do you think? How come I can't make the turn here? Eh... eh... eh... Hey hey hey is the car so hard to drive? Uh, uh... You have been like this for a while, right? It started last year. About a half second each time does xu na know about this? How about a shen? Your head has been hit too many times. It's affecting the normal function of your Iris. Is there a surgery I can do? How long will it take to get back to normal? You've already pushed yourself to the limit. For na. For fey, you have to retire from the racing. Online world champion, ok, test for formula racing, suzuka, march 11 and 12... What the hell? Hey Nick, can you help me to find some information about a driver in formula racing? Hi, lili do you want some? Formula racing what kind of gearbox do they use? 6-speed gearbox. What color do they have on the garage walls at suzuka? I forgot. You never drove in formula racing, right? Why are you lying about it? Why? I didn't mean it. A few years ago I posted a picture of niirburgring then everybody just believed that I'm a real race car driver. That was also the first time you left a message on my board. You could have said it was a misunderstanding. Just tell the truth. I just wanted an opportunity to talk to you. Good. We are having a conversation now. Sorry! I'm really sorry. I tried to tell you. Get out of my way! I'll go explain to a shen and the game company. You can find another driver. I didn't want this at the beginning you dragged me into this. Now you are blaming me for your own lies? If you leave, there will be no sponsorship. Lions will be dead. Do you know that? Anyway, the goal is only to finish one race. I'll pick you up tomorrow in the morning. Bring your gear. Have you done all your warm ups? Champion of the race simulator, right? Show me. Hey, this man is good! Was the sound making him nervous? But it's very noisy here as well. Why? Did the old man apologize? I saw it in the rear view, Jeffery closed the door. He forced you off the track. Does he still say it's all about teamwork but in the end it's all about him. Pretending that he has class. Is talking behind someone's back classier? You are hard to talk to. Actually, I thought about inviting you to join our team. You must be joking, I don't want to be a driver like kojiro who says yes to everything. Um... I didn't say there is a spot for drivers. We are looking for grid girls. Hmm... See you at the race. This is the car my father left. So... your father was a race driver. When I was a kid, he drove illegal races for money in order to support me. Then he never came back. How? Oh, and who's that guy at cafe racer? That guy? He is jet sung. He used to be jefferey's teammate. He seems to be a good driver. He is the reigning champion from last year and the year before. And he took over all the endorsement deals from Jeffery. With all his pride, Jeffery can't have taken that easily. You drive. Find the line before you get into the corner, find the line! Hit the brake hard! Loosen the brake before you get into the corner. Find the line and then hit the brake. You didn't brake hard enough! Sit straight! Once you release the brake, turn your wheel and get into the corner. Can you really drive? What are you doing! What the hell!? Why are you so good on the simulator, but drive like shit? It's the same thing. They are not the same thing. (Asia super pro racing league timing stage 2) Hey! Wow are you trying to kill yourself? Move! Get out of the way! Lili, get well asap. You are much better than this gamer. What were you doing? Go home if you can't drive! Hey he didn't mean it. Sorry, sorry, sorry. He has experience in formula racing. He's just too nervous. We don't care that you want to screw your own team, but you are making us dodge this moving road block on the track. Do you understand this is a real race, not a video game? Car no.4, Jack tu, will start from the last position. Uh, li”, I really... The simulator can't simulate the shake and noise, right? Put these on for the race. They are the full isolation ear plug that mechanics wear when they are working on the engines. You just drive the race car like a simulator. Lights out and the race begins! Jeffery just passed kojiro and is getting very close to jet sung.. A dragons is moving very fast now on the outside. The last in the pack, lions car no.4 approaches from behind, and his name is... Ok, his name is Jack tu his keeps moving up in the ranks. He already passed one ravens and one elephants car. Where is this driver from? He is keeping a good pace, getting out of the corner and ready to attack car no.15 from ravens on the outside. He just passes easily. This is an overtaking show. Jack tu is now at tenth place already. Coming in to turn 11, he brakes so late. My goodness! He drives on the curbs? And he just passed three cars at once! Jack tu is closing the gap and getting close to the cars in the middle. Getting out... and he hits the pedal so early. He is aiming for machi of snakes even kris couldn't block him. Jack tu drives like it's an open road. I have never seen driving like this. He just passes every car, like super Mario after eating a star. The racing line he chooses seems different from everybody else. Shiao-Jen from bunnies is catching up to kojiro, and Jack tu is lurking behind. And he passes kojiro! Kojiro probably doesn't understand what just happened yet. Jack tu passing kojiro means he is in third place. He is going to be on the podium. Wait, Jack tu is attacking Jeffery the king! What are you doing? This is a little bit dangerous, Jack tu is squeezing from the inside, is it a payback for lili from the first race? This is the last lap, facing reigning champion jet sung, Jack tu shows no sign of settling for second place. He is driving like crazy, right behind jet sung and using his slipstream. Jack tu is passing him from the outside, no one has ever tried this line. Jet, don't go with him. Jet sung is very calm and he let the unknown newcomer Jack tu pass. Jet sung has the advantage in total points. There is no need to push it here. Last turn and they are ready for the finish line. In the end it's two lions with a wolves car between them! What the hell was that! Who taught you to drive like that? Didn't you hear the team radio? Jeffery yeah? Sorry, Jeffery, he gets nervous when he hears the noise I gave him ear plugs. What ear plugs? Wa... ha... Great job! Were you playing dumb? Can we have a picture? Let's welcome the chairman of the league to present the award. Listen to this, the game company is thrilled. They got hundreds of thousands more downloads in a single day. Let us know in advance next time when you try to pull this grand slam trick again. You made us worried! What is a grand slam? Grand slam award which means starting from the last position of the grid but finishing as a winner. It was many years ago since anyone won the grand slam award in this league. The winner was Jeffery Lee in his prime. Papa, what does "in his prime" mean? Today, this award symbolizes passing the torch to the next generation You saved lions. As long as you are on the team, the game company will sponsor us for the whole season. I'm going home to draft the contract now. This will take two more months at least. You have to take a proper rest. Lili, I'd like to learn how to use the team radio. Can you teach me? Lili um... ho... ho! Connect your helmet with that wire for radio signal Jack tu is passing him from the outside, no one ever tried this line. I'll do the cooking today. This guy has no real race records other than those from the simulators. So, he is a faker why it's not like the simulator, it keeps slipping around. If I were you, I wouldn't teach him everything. Otherwise if he gets better and better, a shen might trade you. It's slippery because there is water on the track. They can't create that on a simulator. You have to observe how the water flows on the track and find your line. Oh, I see. Jack, I'm going home now. Hop in. Come on, let's swap seats. What? What are you doing? Come on! What exactly do you wanna do? You drive. This car is stick shift. My hand is not healed yet. How am I supposed to change gears? You tell me what to do I'll do it for you. First gear Second gear third gear slow down take it slow. Shift down! Down down down! Turn second gear! I'm getting serious now. Not... second gear do you know how? Listen. Once my hand recovers, I'll fight for my seat in the lions team we will be friends and competitors then. You are learning fast. But I don't intend to lose my seat to you. Um! Please, let me go around one more time... I can definitely do better. There is no need for another round. What do you do? I do test driving for a tire company. You are bold, and adapt to the car very quickly knowing when to back down, and when to push. That is the driver we need. Na Um... I would like to retire after this season. Why now all of a sudden... They are right. I'm not in my prime anymore. I did all I can do. But I didn't beat jet sung at wolves even once. Maybe you were using the wrong approach what else can I do? Pass the ball This league allows two cars for each team. So they work together, to take on the superior competitors you can't always win through one on one racing. So you have to work together on the race track. In my prime... Today is the third race of the league everyone in the crowd has their eyes on Jack tu who just signed an official contract with lions. But he is not that amazing so far, at eighth position. Quite far from where he placed in the last race. The temperature today is as high as 39 degrees. It will be like an oven inside the cars. So far the wolves have a commanding lead. With Jeffery Lee the king right behind kojiro. We're not sure if it's because the lions's car is not as good as wolves or the king is not in his prime anymore. Gamer, where are you? Jeffery, I'm one turn behind you. A shen, prepare the wet tires. What are you talking about? It's perfectly sunny now. I said prepare for wet tires. Can... Jeffery is going into the pits, giving up fourth place. We don't know if there are mechanical problems or something Lions are changing to wet tires. They are going to use wet tires! The relative humidity is less than 40% now are they crazy? Jack, change tires as well Jack tu comes in for his pit stop as well. Both lions take the same strategy. There is no cloud above the track and no sign of rain. Besides, the track temperature is above 60 degrees. Putting wet tires on this track is like putting butter in a frying pan. They won't last even for a lap. As expected, other cars are passing lions. Is it really going to rain? Are they betting too much on it? Jeffery, what should we do now? Unbelievable! It rains! Now the lions with wet tires on will have a huge advantage. I can't believe they got it right! A thunderstorm that no equipment can predict. How did Jeffery Lee see that coming? Jeffery Lee has driven in more than one hundred races on this track. It's his experience and judgement leading the lions. Gamer, did lili teach you how to drive in the rain? Yes. Now all the other drivers are in the pit Lane. It's a battlefield here. Listen carefully, now we are going to do the sling shot. Gamer, pass me. Fourth gear. Full throttle. Now. It's coming, the sling shot tactic created by father shen the crazy it takes two cars working together. The front one creates the slipstream letting the teammate gain 10 percent more speed and overtake like a sling shot. Keep your pace, don't be scared the two lions work together to go faster and faster are you holding up, gamer? Yes. Don't lose it. Kojiro from wolves goes in for wet tires as well. Jet, do you wanna come in? There are only two more laps left, not a chance. Jet sung, who is leading, decides to stay on the track. After all, if he pits in now for wet tires he would be giving the lead away to the lions. But with the rain like this, racing with regular tires will be like running on the ice. It will be hard to control. He must be very confident about his driving skills. Still two more laps to go. Two lions are closing the gap between jet sung, and are ready to hunt. Will jet sung give it away that easily? Get kojiro to block them. Just say we couldn't see the blue flag because of the rain. Ok, kojrio is coming out from the pit Lane. He seems to be waiting for the right timing. He is out of the pit Lane, and right in front of the two lions. That is low! Marshals are waving blue flag, as the lapping car he must give away the position. But he didn't do it cleanly. Jet sung has increased the gap. Observe where the water is flowing. Find the line. Be patient. Jet sung is now within range, the two lions can attack. Only half a lap left. Here it comes! Jeffery Lee is using the slipstream to attack. Jeffery Lee aims for inside, jet sung changes his line to defend! Gamer, now! It's a diversion! Jack tu now uses the slipstream from jet sung to overtake from the outside jet sung couldn't get back to the line. Jeffery Lee gives jet sung no space from the inside. Fantastic tactics! Jack tu takes the lead into the final straight... Wait a minute, it's not over yet. Jeffery Lee uses the slipstream again, Jeffery Lee passes the finishing line. Lions got a one-two finish! That is brilliant! This is the best race from lions for the last few years! Jack tu Jeffery well done. Don't use ear plugs again. Now it has stopped raining and is sunny again. Is this some kind of help from father shen? Let's head to the podium. Dear members of the media, Jack tu claims he has the experience of test driving in formula racing. But in fact, he neverjoined any official races before. All his experience he provided to this league was false. That means he doesn't even have a race car license. Which also means lions and their sponsor treated this professional race as a game. They disregarded the safety of other professional drivers. Since 2017, all top 50 players on simulator racing world are automatically granted a class c license from the international racing association Jack tu ranks no.1 in the world. So his license is valid. We will all do our best to make sure he can keep the points from these races. On the other hand, his dangerous driving has warranted complaints by other drivers I represent our team to apologise for creating these troubles. What do you mean when you say the game company is going to suspend the sponsorship? Are you kidding me? You are the manager of lions. You couldn't even tell he was bluffing? The sponsorship will stop, but we still have the next race, right? You what were you doing? Where did all the money from our sponsorship go? This team was in debt for many years. You always felt the car wasn't fast enough. To make the performance of the car meet your standard, we have paid a lot. So, now I'm the problem? How about your management? There are so many potential sponsors out there, was it really that hard? I'm done explaining to you. You can explain it to your late father. Where did our sponsors go. Hey! Did this team pay you a single penny less in the last few years? In order to beat jet sung, you got one new teammate each year. I was constantly signing contracts and then ending the contracts. Now there are no other drivers who want to sign with us. Do you know that? Also, was there any other teams bringing a contract to you to ask you to join them? Have you ever thought of why that is? Because I wouldn't leave lions. Because you got slower. You hit the brake much earlier than you used to according to sensor data. So is your control over the throttle. Data doesn't lie. I just don't wanna argue with you about these things. Even you think I'm old you think I'm done. Jeffery don't you understand what happened yet? It's not your age that makes you slow. It's your care towards na and fey do you really think not letting them come to the race will prevent you from getting slower? Stop lying to yourself and wake up, please! Tell me. How much debt does lions have? Starting today, Jeffery is the boss of lions. I should have done this a long time ago. That really hurts. They say Jack tu might be suspended from the race. Is that true? The league will let us keep all his points out of pity probably. Because our sole sponsor is pulling their support. What should we do? Did a shen find a new sponsor? Kind of. That's great! What kind of sponsor? Not cosmetics, right? Uh.. I bought lions racing. Jeffery. Boss are we changing the settings of car no. 3? Change car no. 3 for lili and car no. 4 for Jack. We have two good drivers already. I don't need to drive myself. Wolves have fast cars. It's hard to beat them one on one. We can't beat them with one of our cars but that doesn't mean lions can't beat them as a team ok. Suit up. Lili, car no.3 will be yours. Don't ruin its legacy. Copy. Sling shot tactics. I see you making faster times than Jeffery Lee so what? You need a grid girl who can drive fast on your team? I don't think you need me to remind you. I was pushed out of lions because I was faster than him. Wait and see how that selfish guy deals with you. Don't worry. We don't have this problem now. Where is a shen? That's none of your business. So Jeffery Lee becomes the boss and fires a shen? Poor a shen. His dad helped everyone, yet he got nothing in the end. He's not even able to stay in lions. I have a contract here. We pay three times as much as lions. Our car is faster than lions. If father shen was still around, he would like to have us as teammates. Don't you dare to bring father shen up again. Let's see. Ok. Please ask Mr. Wang to call me back after he reads the plan. Or I'll call again. I'm Jeffery Lee the king. Boss, we need 40 more tires, but they say we still haven't paid for the last time, so.. They won't ship to us. How can this team spend so much money? A shen didn't take the money, right? No matter how awful his management is, he wouldn't do that. These financial reports are legit. But even if we spend all our savings it's still not enough for lions to finish this season. A shen actually worked very hard. He kept lions running every year even when it was going downhill. Without him, lions would have been done a long time ago. Hey hey beer? Sure. Let me make something for you to eat. It's a little bit messy. I'm still tidying it up. How is the team? A shen, it really cost a lot of money to run a racing team. How about this: I was thinking... Selling this sail boat my father left me. Should be enough for the tires. But I'll need a guest room from your house. I already sold mine last year. I'm not here to borrow money. I just came to say sorry. Sorry I made a mistake. I shouldn't have put all the pressure on you. I was too selfish. I was just a test driver, nobody knew who I was. Without your father, without lions, I wouldn't be here today. But now, I couldn't even get one deal. A shen you don't have to bring this up. Lions needs you. Will you be willing to come back with me and run this team together? Don't watch that Lili, this is just a simulation race, you don't have to push too hard. Are you kidding? There is always a top driver in a team. That driver will be me. Alright, you will be the top driver. Thanks A shen got the sponsorship back from the gaming company that's great. I'm calling Jack. He's probably training on the karts right now. Lili, the sponsor says the next race they need to see Jeffery on the track. Then how about Jack? Lili, the sponsors, they... They_. After the incident last time, the terms they want in order to keep honoring the contract with us, is that Jeffery and Jack have to be the drivers. Because in the two races they teamed up together. They got both lions on the podium. They refused all the other proposals they want the seat of car no. 3 to temporarily return to Jeffery. Jeffery... You promised to let me team up with Jack. I'm sorry. I don't need your apology. You promised. Lili, we tried everything we could. This is the only way we can keep this team running. Please bear with it for a few more races. Not bad. You are getting close to lili's record on this track. What's her record? 49.8 seconds I've got to be faster. During the race, I have to be right behind her. Does he still say it's all about teamwork but in the end, it's all about him. I was pushed out of lions because I was faster than him. Wait and see how that selfish guy deals with you. Wolves racing, the leading team in aspl held a press conference today. Lili lu, who originally had a contract with lions racing transferred to wolves in the middle of the season. We contacted a shen, the manager of lions, he says he respects her choice. Lili lu was injured in the first race this season because of her competition with teammate Jeffery Lee. And she broke records during practice after her recovery. She is definitely going to be a major contender on the track... How can you do this? Didn't you say that you owe lions a lot? Didn't you say that you wanna beat jet sung together with Jeffery? The settings have been changed as you requested. Get in. Go ask them. Please excuse us. If you won't be in lions, I won't be in this race either. Why didn't you keep your promise? You only care about yourselves. Nobody cares about this team. You talk about teamwork all the time. But you kick lili out because of sponsors. Jack don't behave like this. If lions loses the sponsorship there will be even less of a chance for her to come back. I know you race for lili. And you know what kind of team wolves are. They will sacrifice her when it is necessary. If you stay on the track, at least you can protect her. Hey, is Jack tu going to drive for lions today? Let me check. Saying one thing and thendoing another. Lili lu, coming back to the track from her injury. She transferred to wolves in the middle of the season. She replaces kojiro in car no.2. I think the press underestimated her ability behind the wheel. During the free practice, her first time driving a wolves car, she already set a lap time record as fast as jet sung. Her former teammates Jeffery Lee and Jack tu are on the starting grids right behind her. There's the lights, now the race begins! Lilu lu initiates an attack on jet sung in no time. Driving a wolves vehicle, she probably wants to prove that she is as good a driver as jet sung. Trying to beat me with a wolves car... Such a schemer. Lili's attack seems to be a little bit reckless. Her tires are not warm yet. Jack tu is coming closer. Calm down, Jack. A shen, let him be. The wolves are not driving like teammates. Jet sung shows no sign of backing down from the challenges posed by lili. Come on! Jet sung deviates from his own line and pushes lili, this is a bit controversial. How about that, grid girl! Jack tu continues driving defensively behind lili in third position. Jack, block lili from the inside. He gets ahead. Now he goes wheel to wheel with lili from the inside and Jeffery Lee is on the outside. Two lions are trying to block lili. It seems lili lu needs to calm down. Get out of my way! Lili keeps looking for an opportunity. Her eyes are locked on jet sung. Car no. 4: Jack tu lets lili pass. Lili starts an attack against her teammate jet sung again. This infighting among the wolves is sure to create some sparks any minute. Jack tu closes the gap and gets next to lili again. If you love each other so much. You can go to hell together. Suddenly jet sung pushes lili jack_. Lili has nowhere to go. Jack tu wants to leave some space for lili, but he lost control... (Jeffery in coma, not yet out of danger) I'm not racing anymore. I want to finish this season for Jeffery lions still has a good chance to win the championship. A shen would like to have you back as well. They need you. I need you too. I can do anything for you. But please don't race anymore. What if something happens to you just like what happened to Jeffery? It's fine if you don't join us. Why do you have to keep racing? You still don't get what racing is all about, do you? I promised Jeffery, no matter what kind of injury he got, I'll fix the car in no time. Because he will be back in the race soon. You know that man is so annoying when he complains. A shen lili we owe you an apology. You were right. We were too selfish. If you want to, I would like to have you back in lions. For the fifth race, lili lu comes back to lions. With her teammate Jack tu is not in the race. Eddie driving for elephants is fighting lili lu on turn 18. It's obvious I'm faster, why do I have to listen to you? You always talk about teamwork. It's actually all about you, am I right? Are you done yet? You are not stable enough, I see your weaknesses everywhere. You even overheated your tires. If I didn't cover you, you wouldn't even finish the race. "The king" my ass! You think you are the boss now after father shen is gone? I'm sorry. Enough! That's enough! Go away I never thought you would become a hero this way. Keep lying there, then. Isn't this the professional race driver from TV? You would lose their license if you joined this street race hey wanna get your license terminated get in. What? You don't have enough fun in professional races? I... I don't know. So are you going to give up? I don't understand. Why do people want to race? Damn. Such a deep question. Everyone has their own different reason to race. Every corner is a test. It depends on how you deal with it. Is there an answer? The answer, I think you already have it. Yeah, why do I want to race? I've know that answer all the time. Why are you here? Isn't it race day? Jeffery is in the race now. I want to be here with him. Jeffery Lee is my mentor, so I'll win this race for him. You don't deserve to put Jeffery's car number on your car. Take that number off. Thank you. Hey. You come, and then you go. That's troublesome for us. Do you know that? You got everything you want, why do you keep trying to bring down the lions? Does lions owe you anything? Lions is hypocrite bullshit from top to bottom. What teamwork. You sound like you are so passionate about the sport. Just a slogan to trick kids to buy your merchandise. Actually, you should be grateful to me. If I didn't leave lions, you would be still a karting driver now. Let me go After a major incident, this is the last race for aspl this year. All the spectators are praying for Jeffery the king. We all wish Jeffery, who is still in the hospital observation ward, a speedy recovery. Indeed, this is a dramatic season. But so far, lions is still close to wolves in terms of points. This season they are closest to the annual championship in recent years. Their driver lili lu in car no. 3 just got the best qualifying result for lions in years. Looks like both lili and jet sung want to win this race for Jeffery Lee unfortunately, her teammate Jack tu is having trouble finding his touch. So far he can only struggle in the middle. His performance just keeps going downhill. He doesn't look like the youngest grand slam driver at all. But even so, jet sung and wolves still have to beat the lions without Jeffery Lee because if lions can obtain a one-two finish they can win the title they have wanted for years. This the sixth race of aspl this year. Will lions come back to glory? Jack tu, go get her. Green lights! Lili has a good start. Jack tu makes a mistake at the starting grid though. So far he doesn't have the speed like other professional drivers. After all, it could be a big psychological impact from Jeffery's incident for an inexperienced driver like him lili lu is under attack from jet sung and kojiro that looks dangerous. Without any help from her teammate, lili has no advantage now she is easy prey for the wolves. Lili passes kojiro from inside with a small margin. She keeps her eyes on jet sung. And she is closing the gap bit by bit. What amazing willpower she is showing. Wow, lili tries to push jet sung off the track. Marshals are waving a warning flag now. If she tries that again, she will be out of the race. But it seems she doesn't care. Kojiro! Jet sung and kojiro are attacking lili, she has no chance at all. Kojiro tries to force lili off the track. Jack tu is finally getting close to the leading pack. Will he make it to support his teammate? Lili lost her front splitter in the contact, she will lose her downforce around the front wheel You are right. I still don't understand what you are chasing after. And I probably will never understand. But at least, I found my reason to race. Jack tu from lions finally gets back to normal and catches up. Don't get in my way. You always do whatever you want to do. And you don't care about what other people think about it. I could never behave like this. This is you. This is the you that I like. I might never be able to catch up with you. But I wanna be better because of you. I don't know how to be as courageous as you. But at least I can begin to face my fear. I probably won't be a hero But I do know if I do nothing, I will only be further and further away from you. Lili, I got it now. You are the reason that I race. The two wolves are going away. Do lions still have a chance? Then, prove it to me! Follow me, Jack! Wait, wait! Full throttle, fifth gear, now! This is the formation of sling shot. Lions are not giving up. Jet sung is so fast, plus kojiro covering him... You can't win with one car, doesn't mean we lions can't win as a team. Just follow me closely. Fans of wolves are getting nervous now. Lions are coming for real two lions use their sling shot tactic and keep chasing the competition, now they are right behind kojiro. Jet sung has to make a decision now. Help kojiro or make a bigger gap. He chooses to make a bigger gap. Two on one. Indeed. Now everyone is going crazy. Two lions are coming to hunt down the reigning champion jet sung. If one lion gives up, then there are no tricks they can play. Lili is going from the outside. Was it a diversion? Jet sung has to watch Jack tu as well lili passes jet sung. He plans to focus on defending Jack tu... This was a trap! Now Jack tu has no line to go! Got you. Wolves has an advantage on pure speed, Jack tu couldn't find a way. Jack! Come on! Wow, Jack tu would rather retire from this race than let jet sung finish. Coward! Shit! Jet sung runs into the fence, he is out of this race! Jack tu of lions gets into the last turn. Ready for the victory with teammate lili lu nothing will stop them! Lions racing... Passing the finish line! Being an underdog for years, wins the annual championship with two new drivers working together, their team has made a come back to glory! Lions! Lions! Everyone has a different dream. But if you didn't take the first step with courage, you may never find out the answer for you. What a winning streak. The last challenger today, young k! Do you have a driver's license? Sorry, your winning streak will end today. Ok, let's race!
