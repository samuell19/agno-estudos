They all look so tiny. A feather! Yes! I did it! I've flown with the Great Condor! Hey! Not him again! He's trampling our crops! - I can't believe it! - He's gonna ruin everything! Get out of there! Come here, little llamas! No. Come on! Listen! Yes! Good boys. Naïra! Naïra, look! - I have a feather from the Great Condor! - Stop it! You're frightening them! Tepulpaï! You can be such a pain. - Look! - Tepulpaï! - Go play somewhere else. - I've flown with the Great Condor! Shaman! Shaman? Shaman? Tepulpaï! Only the mountain wind may enter my house without being invited. But, Shaman... I flew with the Great Condor! Look! He gave me a feather. Really? You flew with the Great Condor? - Yes. - And he gave you a feather? Unbelievable. Am I a shaman now, Shaman? Do you believe a feather is enough to make a shaman out of you? Your time would be better spent thinking about what you plan to offer to Pachamama tomorrow. You know your offering must be your most precious treasure. Tepulpaï, come help us. Not again. I hate scrubbing potatoes. How's a potato born, Walumama? Now, this is a very good question. Let us see if Naïra here can answer it for us, since she will soon become a Great One. Hey! Potatoes grow in our fields, just like quinoa and corn. First they appear as little, tiny seeds. Pachamama buries them in her belly. She nourishes and protects them until the harvest season. Just like a mother does with her baby. We are all children of Pachamama. That is why we must love her as much as she loves us. What about you, Tepulpaï? Tell us how we shall show our gratitude to Pachamama for this abundant crop. Tomorrow there is the ceremony. I'll make my first offering, and so will Naïra. And bang, after that, we become Great Ones, and that's it. Lamita. Tepulpaï! Tepulpaï, are you sleeping? - I'm dreaming. - You're not sleeping, but you're dreaming? - That way, I can have any dream I want. - And what are you dreaming about? Let's hurry. Mama Quilla is now high in the sky. Come. What are you gonna ask from Pachamama tomorrow? You didn't get it, did you? Offerings are not about asking but about thanking. You know everything, don't you, Miss Perfect? Watch out, there's snakes! The snakes are the keepers of our cave. They can recognize who is ready to appear before our ancestors. You must trust them. Wait for me here. Beloved ancestors, I come to disturb your peaceful rest only to ask you to entrust me with the huaca. Thank you, ancestors, for your kindness. I will return it after the ceremony. Thank you, Mama Quilla, for illuminating our cave. Oh, Pachamama! Your children are all gathered here to honor and thank you for this harvest. Now, bring forth the huaca. Our huaca protects our village. Our ancestors shaped her and placed within her our most precious treasure. Wow! But, what treasure? Oh, Pachamama, we return to you all that which you have given to us. Potatoes, quinoa, and corn. May these offerings feed your belly. Oh, Pachamama, Naïra and Tepulpaï have grown strong and healthy thanks to you. The time has come for them to make their first offering as a token of gratitude to you. Me first. Tepulpaï, you must offer to Pachamama the most precious thing you have. But this is all I have. I have a feeling you can do better. No! Not my feather! I only got one. This fruit isn't ripe yet. It'll have to wait until the next harvest. Tepulpaï is not a Great One yet! Come, Naïra. Lamita. Pachamama, this is Lamita. She's the most precious thing I have. Pachamama! Must the blood of this llama be shed? Pachamama is so deeply moved that she is shedding her own tears upon our village. Your llama shall be spared. - Now you are a Great One. - Lamita! That's my feather. I hate ceremonies. What? Oh, a quirquincho. Sorry. I took you for a stone. Let me get you... Hey, want to dance again? No, I'm not ready. Already? We barely finished picking our crops. It's the Great Collector of the Great Inca. May our sun god, Inti, illuminate all of you, and woe to the thief, the liar... and the lazy man. I come to collect that which is due to his son, the Great Inca. We have worked hard, and we had an abundant harvest. What? You have thrown all that away? - What a waste! - We did not throw it away. Whatever we give to Pachamama comes back to us. Such primitive, barbarian traditions! Here is the portion we have set aside for you. Who are you to decide what is due to the Great Inca? You must give as many bags as there are knots in my quipu, and this is not enough! - No one can be worse than these Incas! - They're taking away all our crops. We'll have nothing left to eat. We're lucky they can't take our fields away. You had more than enough, but you chose to dump everything down into that hole. You wretched peasants are too generous with your Pachamama. They are offerings so that she might protect our village. Silence, old fool! The only one who protects you is the Great Inca! He builds the roads and illuminates the world! This statuette makes you all stupid. I am confiscating it. - No! - You cannot do that. You don't get to decide. I will offer it to the Great Inca as a sign of submission from your village. - Walumama? - Walumama! - Walumama! - Is she all right? - Is she okay? - What happened? I hate the Incas! Let's go attack them by surprise and squish them! Vengeance is not in the spirit of the Condor. But we can't just sit around and do nothing! We have to get the huaca back! I will see to that. As soon as Walumama no longer needs my care. But, Shaman, if we wait too long, we'll never catch them. They'll get to Cusco and give the huaca to the Great Inca. Then it'll be too late. Can't you just listen to the shaman without arguing for a change? Who asked you, Miss Perfect? Let Walumama get some rest. But, Shaman, I... Go to bed, now! Listen to the shaman, will you? Great Condor, help me find the huaca. Kirkincho! You're back. So you're not mad at me, after all? Come on. I'll show the shaman what I'm capable of. You're coming with me? The road to Cusco! The city of the Inca. Lucky you. You can eat whatever you find. I hate dandelion. Make way for the chasqui, the messenger of the Inca! Hey, chasqui! Got any food or drink for me? Don't steal, don't lie, and don't be lazy! What, Kirkincho? No way. I'm not carrying you. I'm tired. Come on, move. Llama's hair. The Incas have crossed here. Great Condor, make me strong. Tepulpaï, wait up! Naïra? What are you doing here? I'm coming with you, and so is Lamita. The shaman sent you to spy on me, right? He did not. He doesn't even know I'm here. I see. So, now Miss Perfect is disobeying the shaman. Well, yes. Someone must bring the huaca back to the village. Kirkincho and I, we don't need any help. Especially from you! Tepulpaï! Don't leave me. See? You're such a coward, you can't even cross the bridge. She's way too scared. Come on. Let's go. I'm so hungry. Tepulpaï! Wait for us. You again? - Go back to the village! - We're coming with you. - You can't stop us. - No way! You'll slow us down. I don't need you. Hey! Listen, Mr. Rude. We didn't walk all this way for nothing. And don't tell me you don't need this. This is good. Thank you, Pachamama, for feeding us and giving us strength for this journey. Right. We have no time for ceremony. The Incas aren't gonna wait for us. All right, we'll go together. But I make the decisions, and I bring the huaca back to the village. "I." With you, it's always, "I." You're so selfish. Yeah, Miss Perfect. Talking is not gonna help us catch up with the Incas. We must go. Make way for the chasqui of the Inca! Look at those stars above our village. They're the stars of the Great Condor. Can you see them? Are you dreaming again? You know, I can't stop thinking about Walumama. She was so ill when I left the village. Don't worry. I'm sure the shaman will heal her. What if he doesn't? And what if we don't find our huaca? What are we gonna do? Look! Over there! One of the stars is dancing. Come on. Let's take advantage of the night to find the Incas. The Incas. They've gone into the sea of clouds. - Let's go. - No, wait. There's so many of them. They're stronger, and they've got weapons. How are we gonna do this? We'll just come from behind. Quiet and slow. They won't see us with all these clouds. Come on, Great Condor. Guide us through the clouds. Tepulpaï! Where are you? Are you okay? Yes. The Incas are so loud. We can't miss them. Listen, it's this way. We must stick to the trail. Otherwise... But... the trail is gone! Can you hear? Over there! Tepulpaï, look at Lamita. It's this way. Okay, let's go. Not that way! Tepulpaï! Thank you, Lamita. We're so lucky you're here. Walumama always says that whenever you're scared, you should breathe deeply to remind yourself that you're alive. I'm not afraid. Yuck! Oh, no! I think I stepped on a... Yes! I know how to find the Incas. All we have to do is follow their llamas' droppings. Come on. Follow me! I hate the Incas... and their llamas! Cusco. The City of the Sun. It's shaped like a puma. And it's... glittering. It's too late. They've arrived. They're going to meet with the great Inca. - All is lost. - We're not giving up! Hold on! We're not just going to jump into the mouth of the Puma. I told you that it wouldn't be easy. No one forced you to come. May I remind you that, without us, you would have fallen down and broken your neck in that sea of clouds. You should think twice before making decisions. Think twice? We are never gonna get our huaca back just by think twicing. Make way for the... chasqui of the Inca. What happened to you? I've come from the shore with a message for the Great Inca. A floating house has arrived on the waters. Beings from another world. Monsters with metal skins. They spit fire, and... And what? - And we must... - Must what? We must deliver the message to the Great Inca. Isn't that what a chasqui's supposed to do? Yes. Is he...? I think he's gone to meet his ancestors. His pututu. Tepulpaï. What is it? Those gods are really... mighty gods. So if the Great Inca needs to hear this message, right? And we need to get our huaca back... can't we make some kind of trade? Now, that, Naïra, that is some great think twicing. I'm taking the pututu. What about this poor man? Well... He's come all that way to deliver this message. So now, it's up to us to finish his mission. We won't let you down, brave chasqui. You'll be proud of us. Come on. Let's hurry, Naïra. Pachamama, watch over him. Easy, Lamita. They're not real pumas. They're just Inca guards. Don't show them we're afraid, or else they won't let us through. Now we are the chasquis. May our god Inti illuminate you, travelers, and may the thief, the liar, and the lazy man be punished. Make way! Fresh fish for the Great Inca! They are on their way to see the Great Inca. Let's follow them. Wow! The Temple of the Sun. That is a very high house. It's high enough to be closer to his father, Inti. Yes, but... all those stairs to get up there! How does he do that? No idea. Besides, they say he never touches the ground. It's too dirty for him. Make way for the chasquis of the Inca! If you're a chasqui, then I'm a llama. We have the pututu. He claims to be a chasqui? Then let him prove it. What on Earth was that? Any chasqui who blows into the pututu may enter the temple, regardless of his size. You may enter, chasqui! Next! Great Inca, here is some medicine prepared by our shaman from the bark and roots of the Kuntisuyu, a plant found in our village. Interesting. Give it to the llamas of the Inca. Inti has spoken. Next! Great Inca, our people, the Kollasuyo, have crafted for you this cloak, with the feathers of the rare luta bird from the White Mountains. A rare bird that gets so easily caught has no glamour. This cloak is not a cloak, it's a rug. Inti has spoken. It's the Great Inca. He's being carried on some sort of tray by servants. That helps with the stairs. Next! Great Inca, we have walked all the way from the riverbanks to bring you this basket of fresh fish. Not in the mood for fish. But, Great Inca... we have run nine suns nonstop and... Inti has spoken. Out! Next! Oh, Great Inca! Accept this offering from a remote village. Its people wish to express their deep gratitude for your radiant protection and are now entirely devoted to Inti, their only god. Our huaca! - I'll have a word with this Great Inca. - No, wait. Let me handle it. Make way for the chasquis of the Inca! These are some very tiny chasquis. Oh, Great Inca, we bring you a very big... important message. As big as you, no doubt. Very well. Speak! Just as soon as Your Lightness agrees to repair a great injustice. How dare you address the Son of the Sun with such arrogance? You are bold, tiny chasqui. How amusing. Continue. Your great collector here stole this huaca. It belongs to our village. You must give it back to us. Great Inca! The peasants in that village are nothing but a lazy lot. They steal! And they lie. No matter. I already have a whole room filled with these trinkets, bigger and fancier than this one. Now, return this thing to the tiny chasqui. No! Now, let me have my message. Well, here it is. Many metal gods have arrived on Mama Cocha, our mother sea. On a huge floating house. They are mighty gods, spitting fire... and burying everything in their path. And they will destroy the Incas. Hold him up! The Great Inca is about to fall! Woe to the world if he touches the ground. No, that old story again! Invented by the Great Observer! I don't ever want to hear about those so-called metal gods again. No one can destroy the son of Inti! Throw these tiny liars into the dungeon. The pumas will shut them up! We're not liars! And I'm not tiny! May the Great Condor strike you and throw you out of your stupid tray! Did I do this? I am a powerful shaman. Guards? Guards! Oh, no! Oh, I touched the ground! I'm all filthy! Guards! What is this? The chasquis were telling the truth! Pretty weird-looking for gods. What are you doing? No, that's mine! You can't take that. That's my jewelry! They're not gods. They're thieves! - They're monsters! - It's not funny. I want them to stop. Inti has spoken! Oh, stop, please! The huaca, quick! No! No! It contains our most sacred treasure! What are you doing? But it's sacred! No! Run! Lamita! Run! Don't worry, Naïra. She will find her way back to the village. Come on. Hurry! Let's hide. Oh, no! It's chipped! Listen! That's condor feathers in there. Feathers don't make that sound. Here, run and bring the huaca back to the village. Good luck, Tepulpaï. Kirkincho? Oh, you scared me. You know, I'm glad to have you as a friend. Okay. Now we've gotta get out of here and fast. Naïra and Lamita need us. Do you smell something? Go on. Find the exit! Hurry, Kirkincho! We don't want the pumas to catch us. Is this the way? Oh, come on! With you, it's always eat, eat, eat. You're such a selfish glutton. Back off, Puma! You're facing the power of the Great Condor! You have nothing to fear! This puma is the sun of my night. He is my eyes. He keeps me company. And what is your name, little one? Tepulpaï. And I'm not little. I need to get out of this place as fast as possible to go find my friend Naïra. The men of metal are chasing her, and they want to steal... I should have known. They are the ones who make the ground tremble. You know them? I saw them in the stars a long time ago. Men of metal, with hair on their chins, would come on Mama Cocha. And I know what they're capable of. Oh, so you're the Great Observer. Well, the Great Inca said you were a liar. Yes! He didn't believe me! But he was wrong, it seems. The men of metal attacked him, and they took everything from him. And, you know? He touched the ground! So now, you can get out, too. Alas, there is no way out of the labyrinth. Oh, you are soaking wet! Forgive my lack of hospitality. I've been living alone here for so long. Come, dry off in my chamber. Pachamama, thank you for feeding me here in the depths of your belly. You know, before they threw me into this hole, I was the Great Observer of the Inca. Yes, the Sun Gazer! I worshiped Inti, our sun god. - Really? - Yes. And now, here I am. Forever deprived of light. Such irony! I have become the Shadow Gazer. Grateful for this puma to keep me company. You'll see. You'll get used to it in time. Just like me. I don't wanna get used to it. I want to go home with Naïra, Lamita, Kirkincho, and our huaca. Anger breathes crazy ideas through your head, my boy. I hate the Incas and the men of metal. They're thieves. - They want to steal our huaca! - And have you never taken anything without permission? Get some rest, little one. And learn to gaze upon your own shadows. Forgive me, Great Condor, for taking that feather... and for lying to the shaman. I know how to get out! Shadow Gazer, come with me! Come on! My poor child, no one can leave the realm of shadows. The Great Condor is the master of the wind. He will guide me. You're wasting your time. I have warned you! Thank you, Great Condor. Thank you for leading me out of that labyrinth. Lamita! You're here! I've been so worried. Naïra! Are you all right? Thank you! The Great Condor will fly us back to the village. No! This time, I'm not leaving Lamita! It's up to you now, Kirkincho! - Come on! Go, now! - Hurry! Naïra! This is just like in my dream. Look how beautiful Pachamama is from the sky. Oh, no! The Great Condor is losing its feathers. Look. He's hurt! Condor! Condor, wake up! Naïra, we've gotta jump! - Ready? - Yes. Now! Is it broken? No, just a bump. I'll be okay. It is broken. Oh, poor huaca! Do you think the Great Condor crashed? I don't know, but we don't have much time. The men in metal will be here soon. Here, take the huaca and protect her. I'll run to the village to alert the shaman and Walumama. - Tepulpaï! - What? Think twicing! Think twicing to you, too, Naïra! Think twicing. I must protect the huaca, so... take her very far away. Or hide her... in the cave! No, 'cause of the snakes. The Condor. Condor! Great Condor! Shaman? I'm sorry for the bumpy landing. - Did you get hurt? - I'm fine. I'm fine. Our people need you, Tepulpaï. Run to the cave, and bring the huaca back to the ancestors. Go faster than the wind. Yes, Shaman. Naïra! - Isn't Tepulpaï with you? - Naïra, where's Tepulpaï? All of you go hide behind the cacti, quick! The men of metal are coming! - Where's the shaman? - He left the village to find you. - You didn't see him? - No. And Walumama? The shaman... tried his best. The snakes are the keepers of our cave. They can recognize who is ready to appear before our ancestors. - You must trust them. - You must trust them. Hopefully, it'll work. They mustn't find us. Lamita! Oh, Lamita! I love you! No, not Pachamama's well! No! This is Pachamama's well! You have no right to take what's inside of it! Watch out! They will make the ground shake! Stand back! It's so dark. I can't see. Ancestors, I have brought the huaca back to you. It's a bit... smashed, I know. But the men of metal are here to attack our village. We really need her protection. Pachamama never forgives. Fire! There's a fire! There's a fire! What should we do? Shaman! Shaman! Are you hurt? Hurry! Bring me my drum. Is Tepulpaï back? No! Thank you, ancestors. Walumama! - Thank you, Walumama! - Thank you, Walumama! It's over, Tepulpaï. Come on. Come on! Hurry! Wow! You're not such a coward, after all! Let's go! - Over here! Put it out! - Hurry, we need more! The fire! It's burning our fields! Look! The shaman is calling for the rain! Oh, no! Please, Shaman, don't give up! The Inca stole all our crops. We have nothing left to eat. And no more seeds to sow. What are we going to do? Why, Shaman? Why are such calamities striking our village? Pachamama hears us no more. I found these in the huaca. But these are... These are seeds! Quinoa, corn, and potato seeds! As old as our ancestors. Pachamama, our mother. These three seeds you stored in the huaca are the last seeds we have left. We give them to you. May this offering feed your belly. It's raining! Tepulpaï and Naïra, our two little saviors. Tepulpaï, you have grown so much. I see the Great Condor in you. Now, dance for Pachamama, little Shaman.
