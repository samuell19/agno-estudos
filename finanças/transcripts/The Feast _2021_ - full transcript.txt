The Feast I want to make a good impression Glenda! She was worried you weren't coming. You're late. We're a long way from town, but I did send directions. Did you follow them? Doesn't matter, you're here now. Come on. Fuck! You're expected to prepare the food, serve, clear the plates. My husband doesn't realize how much work he creates by inviting guests over for dinner. I've been planning this for days and when Lynwen said she wasn't free to help... Lynwen holds you in high esteem. You're not going to let her down, are you? Good. Fuck! Guto, did you stack the logs in the shed? I want to make a good impression! We'd better start. There's a lot to do. I was hoping you'd be here when the courier came. The local supermarket is fine for everyday items, but you won't find bok choy on its shelves. Go and set the table. You'll find the tablecloth by the door. These have been ironed, the knives and forks are in the drawer. What's that? Mud? Dirt? If you've marked it, I'll... Bastard dry cleaner! Fuck! This will have to do. It was my mother's. Gweirydd, I haven't even unpacked the ingredients yet. Go! Who is she? Cadi. She's working for us tonight. No Lynwen? Lynwen's father became ill earlier in the week. I won't need dinner. Your father will expect you to join us at the table. My diet has been designed especially for me. I've been following it for two weeks. Eat what you want. But if you expect your father to keep financing this triathlon business... you'd better come to the table when his guests arrive. Cadi, the table. Out. Fuck! I didn't say anything about flowers. And the glasses don't match. No, leave them. They'll have to do. I didn't keep many things after my mother. Her favorite dress, hairbrush... But when we decided to demolish the farm, it was a different story. That old table cloth, blankets... I kept everything in storage for two years while this house was being built. But... the things I kept... they don't suit the place now. They feel primitive. Do you want a taste? Guto used to love this stuff when he was little. Mango, pineapple... I spent the first five years of his life cutting fruit into small pieces. I guess you know who my husband is. Your Member of Parliament. Naturally, we spend most of the year in London, but we return regularly. Towel, quickly! Thank you. Supper. What's wrong? Haven't you seen a gun before? Your assistant for the night, yes? God only knows why she needs help preparing supper for seven people. I'd like to see you prepare a three-course meal. I take it you have the honor of skinning them? Where are you going? What's wrong? He shot them. Two rabbits. More than one? He'll be boasting about this for weeks. That's why my father enjoys coming here. To kill innocent creatures. You're safe to go back inside. The only people my father really wants to shoot are his political opponents and his parents. My father had a very unhappy childhood. You've got something on your shirt. Lynwen serves rabbit at the pub regularly. I assumed you'd be familiar with the job. Don't tell me you're a vegetarian. Are you ill? Pregnant? Luckily I've done this before. I didn't have a choice when I was a girl on the farm. There's a white blouse in my wardrobe you can borrow. You'd better watch out That county councilor phoned again. He thinks you're avoiding him. He's right. Those papers arrived for you. More reading... but that's the nature of the job. It's not a job, Glenda. It's a privilege. I'm sorry if I scared you earlier. Can we be friends, Cadi? I want to be your friend. You'd better watch out... Walking down the street Seeing your curly head of hair... You wake with a smile From a beautiful sleep... King of the crows With your lively eyes... Oh, my sweet You'd better watch out Where did you hear that? I haven't heard that song since... well... my mother. You'd better watch out... Oh, lovely girl You'd better watch out You'd better watch out Mischievous child You'd better watch out You have a nice voice. You talked about starting a choir, Glenda. Maybe Cadi could be your first recruit. We'll need something to light the candles, Gwyn. Fire. I'd better get myself ready. I need to borrow your lighter. If you take my lighter, Gwyn, how will I light my spliffs? I know you've given up that nonsense. Because you've been checking up on me? Your mother and I don't want to treat you like this, Guto. No, you're doing it for my benefit. Thanks. What else were we supposed to do? Your girlfriend called to tell us you were lying on the kitchen floor with a needle in your arm. You can return to London when you've shown us you've grown up. Sorry I've disappointed you. I don't want to have this conversation now, Guto. Two sons - both have brought shame on the family. Maybe you should shoulder some of the blame, Dad. Gweirydd? Drink? -Where's Gweirydd? -Why? Cadi? Cadi? Have you seen Gweirydd? No. Why? No reason. My mother said you work at the Red Lion. Did you know my grandparents? They lived here... when the place was still a farm. You don't say much, do you? Sorry. Don't apologize. Everyone else I know talks non-stop even when they don't have anything of value to say. Have you thought of moving away from this place? Why? Well... clubs, bands, parties... I couldn't live anywhere other than a big city. London is my home. But you're here now. Not for long. Listen... What do you do when you go out with friends? Drink cans, vodka? My parents are so full-on... so intense. If I don't take something before long, I might kill them. Do you think you can help me out? Does Glenda know you're slacking? After all, the devil makes work for idle hands. For fuck's sake! Fuck! Euros! I'm sorry, Gwyn. Don't worry. A wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon. I bought it for tonight. We have plenty of wine in the house. Cadi, clear this mess, will you? Come in. Forgive me, I heard the car, but I was still getting ready. Vintage, 2009. I wasn't holding the bottle tight enough. Oh, what a waste! The shoes got the worst of it. Via Condotti, Rome. Give them to me to dry. Italian leather, Glenda. I might as well try. Give me your socks, too. Guto, get a pair of socks for Euros, clean ones. I don't want to impose. Don't be silly, you're a guest. Cadi, take the canap√©s over. Everything looks so delicious. Where to start? I hope you like fish. Golden grey mullet, Euros. I lobbied for steak, of course. Don't pretend that you're fussy about what you eat. Although, for once, Gwyn has made his contribution to the feast tonight. You managed to shoot one? Two. I'd been out for a couple of hours... when I saw one leap towards the bank. I sat there quietly. And just before I fired the gun... another one showed its face. And then a third. A fourth. -A family of the little bastards! -Bang, bang! Euros. White socks? What's wrong with you? I would have brought a variety of colors if you'd only asked. -Guto. -It doesn't matter. Nobody will know apart from us. Excuse me. Go and find your brother. It's time for you to come to laugh at Euros' jokes. If we laugh hard enough, maybe he'll open his wallet again. At least we'll inherit the fortune one day. Mom and Dad aren't going to die. They'll stalk the face of the earth for ages... like vampires. Fuck it - if both of us say we're leaving, they won't be able to stop us. How, Guto? We could walk into town... get a ride from someone. Maybe Cadi could take us? I saw you in the forest. Did she let you touch her? -What are you talking about? -Did you use your fingers? -You're fucking sick. -Tongue - in and out? Forget it. You deserve to be here. Freak! There's a feast awaiting us The red triangles represent the sites that are yet to be explored. Yellow - the sites that haven't shown potential. And green sites where minerals and valuable metals have been discovered already. And the black square is this house, right? You've been very supportive of our enterprise. This house is testimony to that. What about the blue triangle? A site where the exploratory work has been postponed. One of our workers became ill there this morning. But the work will continue? The drill went deeper than usual and we've discovered... this. There's no record of caves in the area. It contradicts all the geological information we have. We're organizing a team of climbers to go there to find out more. And this site is... what? 30 meters from the border between our land and Iori and Mair's farm? 23 meters to be precise, yes. The company appreciates your commitment to our work. And I appreciate the company. A little something to tide you over. On cue. Mair! Welcome! Thank you for the invitation. Sorry it's taken so long to arrange a date. Mair, it's been too long. I don't think you know Euros. Euros, Mair; Mair, Euros. -It's a pleasure. -Hello. Where's Iori? Not ill, I hope? A car has gone into the lake. I don't know if it lost control, crashed, or... The police are there now. Awful. Iori offered to fetch the tractor to pull the vehicle out, so here I am. Come in. There's a feast awaiting us. Cadi, come and take Mair's coat. Mair, this is Cadi. She works for Lynwen at the Red Lion. You probably know each other. You used to go to the chapel. Oh, is there a non-believer in our midst? I was sorry for your loss. Go and prepare the first course. I'll be over soon. I'm sure you must be thirsty, Mair. Red or white? Water, please. I feel awful. I didn't know Cadi had suffered such a loss. Her father, he was working with the company building the wind turbines. He was carrying parts on his lorry when the brakes failed. Good evening. Gweirydd, how are you? Very well, thank you. You remember Mair? -Mrs. Bowen. -Mair, please. I've seen you racing along the roads on your bike. I don't know how you climb the hill to Cwmoernant. It's so steep! Sweat, perseverance. Gweirydd is competing in a triathlon, Mair. That's why you've given up being a doctor. I heard you're no longer working at the hospital. It must be a huge commitment to prepare for a race like that. He'll resume his career once he's completed the challenge. Mair, come and see the house. I'm so pleased with it. I take every opportunity to show people around. The architect was keen to source the best materials. He tried to buy locally, but it wasn't always possible. This is where I come to relax, meditate. Stunning, isn't it? It's... different. Life in the city is so frantic. It's so nice to escape to a room like this to... breathe. It's like a cell. It's a retreat, a retreat from the world. Everything all right, Cadi? The sage. By the back door. Be a love and get it, will you? We're having rabbit with a tropical fruit salsa to start. Gwyn is bound to tell you he shot the rabbits himself! Glenda... are you all right? Yes, fine. Come. She mustn't be awakened Don't wait for us. Eat! Lovely, thank you. You'll find Gweirydd's food in the red box in the fridge. What's on the menu tonight? Something tasty? Pomegranate is a miracle food. If you don't like it... No, it's important to try new things. The rabbit is superb, Glenda. I shot it! And I cooked it! Thank you, Euros. Does Iori still shoot? He hasn't been out recently, no. Tell him not to leave it too long. You need a good eye, but practice makes perfect. Running the farm must be a full-time job for Iori. I'm sure it is, but everyone should find time to relax. It's important. I learned that the hard way. If I hadn't had that scare with my heart, I'd still be working incessantly. -Did you have a heart attack, Gwyn? -Yes, I was very worried. It was a peptic ulcer. He had treatment and the pain decreased. Although my father would want everybody to think his life was in danger, nobody's died from a tendency to over produce stomach acid. -You might be the first, Dad. -Indeed! What the fuck is that? You're not going to let him eat that at the table? Calm down. -It's fucking disgusting! -That's enough. Gweirydd is on a special diet. Raw meat, meat that's still breathing. -It's totally safe, healthy. -It's fucking gross! -Go to your room! -Forgive us, please? -Why am I the one that has to leave? -Now! A dog wouldn't even eat that. He's not all there! Go to your room. Now! Gwyn! You don't want to have a real heart attack! Euros, Mair, I'm so sorry. The meat is fresh. It's treated before I eat it. Gweirydd, please, that's enough. I'm so sorry, Mair. Eat! Sorry, it drives Iori up the wall when I... Take your time. I've had enough. It's lovely, but... You want to allow room for the main course. Don't forget dessert. Cadi. You're spoiling us. I don't remember when I last had such a feast. Glenda thinks I visit to discuss business with Gwyn, but in truth I come for the hospitality. What exactly do you do, Euros? I help small businesses find ways to make money with their assets. It works like this, Mair. You and Iori have assets in the farm. The buildings, the livestock, equipment... Euros' work is to think of new ways for you to make money other than producing milk. I inspire businesses to diversify. We've known Euros for years. He's helped us to realize our full potential. Come on, Glenda, you've known Mair since you were a girl. There's no need to be modest. Euros has made us a lot of money over the years. Well, my mother and father owned 300 acres of land. We sold a percentage to our neighbors... And then we met Euros. You're responsible for the mining work? The consortium has been working with Gwyn and Glenda for a long time. I'll be sorry to see this chapter come to an end. But you and Iori needn't miss out. Would you be interested in discussing the opportunities? It's not fair to ambush you like this. Perhaps we should wait until Iori arrives. We need the land. It's our livelihood. I'm not suggesting for a moment you stop farming. We would ask for a license to explore your land. And if we were to find valuable minerals, mine them in a responsible, sustainable way. Iori has mentioned that money is tight. It might be a way to ease the strain. The farm gives us an income. Yes, but for how long? We're managing. You are, yes. But are you willing to settle for that? You've worked hard, Mair. You should be able to retire without worrying about paying the bills. Gweirydd? Gweirydd, are you all right? Gwyn, do something. For God's sake, help the boy. Thank you. I don't know what would have happened if you hadn't intervened. Let me do that. Take a plate to Guto. He'll be pouting and won't admit he's hungry. You'll get a bonus for everything you've done for us tonight. Everything all right, Glenda? Yes, Mair, thank you. Help me. I'm sorry the plates are so untidy. I should have let you serve the food, Cadi. Perhaps I've had one glass too many. No more than usual, darling. We both have a terrible thirst, Mair. That's one of the things I found attractive about her. Cadi, come here. Come here. Don't be shy! Cadi was far from being shy earlier. She was singing! Gwyn. What, you don't believe me? Sing for us now, go on. Sing for us. Sing for us. -Dad. -Sing! What's wrong? What? And here it is - the district. This is our house. The stream. The forest. Fields to the west... And this line is the border between what was my parents' farm and yours. When strangers come to the house, they see the painting and see all sorts of grand themes. Like... Hope! Love! All I see is the holiday in Mauritius I could have had with the ten grand we paid for it. As Gwyn said earlier, Euros has been very generous. Do you know how much of our land he would need? The company would drill in one or two areas initially. And if they found anything of value, well, who knows? They are interested in this area. The Rise. They've found something on our side of the border and they suspect the vein runs through your farm all the way to the west. We don't farm the Rise. Then that's a good reason to consider Euros' offer carefully. Leave the Rise alone. That's what everyone has done. You're not superstitious? You know the story. A legend! That's where she's resting, Glenda. That's what the adults said to keep us kids from wandering! She shouldn't be awakened. Nonsense, and shame on you for believing it. Thanks for the invitation, but I think I should go. -What about dessert? -It's late and I need to see Iori. -I've made a pavlova! -No, thank you. Do you have any idea how much work goes into making a pavlova, woman? Your mother would be ashamed if she saw the person you've become. Mair, when will it be convenient for me to call to discuss the possibilities? I don't want to waste your time. Iori would appreciate hearing what Euros has to say. No, thank you. Cooperating could be mutually beneficial. Take a business card. We have no interest in what you have to offer. Gwyn. Gweirydd! Gweirydd! Fuck, what's happened? -No, not him! -We'll have to call an ambulance. No, it's too late. He'll die if you don't help him. What do you expect me to do, look at him! Do it. -No-- -Do it! The girls. The girls he raped... -Shut your fucking mouth! -Patients in hospital, asleep. Now, Gweirydd, now! Deeper. Sleep in peace, dear child Sleep quietly on your mother's breast How is he? Sleeping. Outside, please. Mommy. Mair, I'm so pleased you came back. Gwyn is ill, I can't find Gweirydd or Guto. They pulled the car from the lake. It's Cadi's car. They said if she returned, she'd need a body to live in. Have you seen Cadi? No. This food is delicious. Sleep child upon my breast... It's safe and warm... Mother's arms are tight around you... A mother's love is in my heart... Nothing shall disturb your slumber... Nobody will do you harm... It's time to come home! It's late! I told you never to go to the Rise! How many times have I warned you? After you've taken everything, what will be left? What's wrong, Glenda? What is this? After you've taken everything, what will be left? What?
