This is the Paris office of the New York Herald Tribune. A great news gathering center tied by direct wire... to every major capital on the European continent. Into these offices early last year, came a phone call that made one of the most... shocking headlines of the day. This is the story of the man who tried to break through an iron wall of censorship... to get the facts behind that headline. Budapest calling. Get to the New York office, Larry O'Connell, put it on the amplifier. - Go ahead Budapest. - This is Barker. Anderson's trial just finished. A sentence of 20 years of hard labor followed a verbal confession by Anderson in court. I'll give it to you in Anderson's own words. I speak of my own free will, my name is Robert Anderson. I am 52 years of age, I am an American, I am a spy. I'm being paid by the American government to spy on the Hungarian people's government. Barker, this is Nick. Did you get a chance to talk to Anderson? You can't get by that monitor Nick, they'll cut him off every time. I know but one can't help trying. Prime Minister Andreas Ordy will be on the air at 8:30 tonight, Budapest time... to explain the Hungarian government's position on this trial. That's it for today. I speak of my own free will. Who they think they're kidding? - Mr. Strang, your New York call. - Switch it to my office. And Biddle, locate Mrs. Anderson, she's somewhere in Paris. - We've been trying to find her for two days. - Well, keep on trying. Larry? Guilty, 20 years. His confession is on the teletype. - Anderson's confession is coming in now. - Get on it. Have you had a statement from the Hungarian embassy? No, it's too soon. Everybody in Europe waiting to see which way Washington is going to jump. I want the reaction for my next edition if possible. You'll get it. By the way, are you using Jimmy Race on this? - Using everybody. - Don't underestimate that boy Nick. I don't, he's good, but he's hot headed. Remember he broke the communist story here and he helped the FBI find Schultz. I'm deeply impressed, I'll tuck him in every night. Talk to you later. - Who's going to cover the American embassy? - I'll speak to the ambassador myself. Ambassadors come and go, but fashions go on forever. You can have exactly half that space Sandy. - I better send Dad to the Hungarian... - I want Jeanne to cover that. - Jeanne? - But she's in Budapest. I ordered her back, her plane arrives in 20 minutes. Call the airport and have her go there before she comes to the office. You could give her a chance to catch her breath. - She'll catch her breath later. - Why don't you send somebody else? Because I haven't anyone else whose hand is been kissed by the Hungarian ambassador. Paging mademoiselle Jeanne Moray. Paging mademoiselle Jeanne Moray. Mademoiselle Moray, call at information desk please. - I am mademoiselle Moray. - Your office wants you to call immediately. Thank you. Votre papier? I am a personal friend of the ambassador's. If you take my name in I'm sure he'll see me. I am sorry mademoiselle, he can't see anyone. Excuse me, I work on an American paper. - Perhaps you could tell me... - I am sorry. Yes sir. Gentlemen, gentlemen please. It is useless to wait any longer. There will be no statement issued by he Hungarian ambassador at this time. That is all gentlemen. Just a minute friend, Anderson is still an American citizen. Don't you think you'd better give me some sort of... Our statement will be given in due time. Then you won't mind if I hang around and wait, will you? - I must ask you to leave mister... - Race, James Race. Why don't you go and tell the ambassador that I'm... parking right here until I get some sort of statement. - Mr. Race? - Yes? - That's not the way we do things here. - Don't we? This is supposed to be the embassy of a friendly government. They don't act very friendly, do they? I think you'd better leave. I'm just trying to stir them up and get some action. I'm afraid you've succeeded. - C'est homme. - Vous papier s'il-vous-pla?t. - He wants to see your papers. - Oh, sure. You have to tell him I left them at the office. You'll have to go with him. Would you be interested in a steady job doing this sort of thing for me? Hey, wait a minute. - You can't leave me now. - You wanted action, you got it. Well, be a pal, will you and call my editor for me? He's Nick Strang at the Herald Tribune. I'll see that he gets the news. One week Nick, you could've let me stay in Budapest one more week. That's the point, I couldn't. I found I missed you too much. Besides, the Anderson trial is over. But Nick, I was on the track of a really important story. If it was important it was dangerous. And a front page story isn't worth your pretty neck to me. Don't you even want to know what it is about? Well, not right now. I haven't seen you in two months. Nick, this is a story as important as the Tito-Stalin break. - Does Barker know about it? - Of course he does. Good. Nick, this is not the ordinary kind of a story. All right, what kind of story is it? What would you say if I told you that a short time ago... Ordy was making a deal behind Russia's back to join up with Tito? Rumors like that come out of the Balkans regularly on the half hour. But this is a rumor we may be able to prove. And if we could prove it, we might be able to help Anderson. Jeanne, I don't think I'm going to send you on any more assignments away from Paris. It's too nice having you around here. All right, I won't tell you about it. But if Reuters and AP should make you look like the worst... fool in the newspaper business, don't come to me for sympathy. Now, about dinner tonight. Biddle said you were looking for me. - Well? Hello. - Hello. A telephone call would've done, you didn't have to go to all this trouble for me. Well, to tell the truth, I'd forgotten all about you. - How did you get out? - Influence. - You two know each other? - For hours. This young lady is been functioning as my interpreter. - When was all this? - At the Hungarian embassy. I don't think Mr. Race realized that I work on this paper too. On this one? Well, have to renew my subscription. Race, what were you doing at the Hungarian embassy? Getting an interview with the ambassador. - You got an interview with the ambassador? - I didn't know that was a problem. The police ushered me in and there he was. He made some nasty remarks about reporters... I made some nasty remarks about Hungarian ambassadors and the first... thing you know, we had the makings of a pretty good story. I also have a few comments from Anderson's wife. Anderson's wife? How did you locate her? While I was talking to the ambassador, she called in to make a plea for her husband. Well, I found out where she was staying. - Well, what about her? - She's quite a woman. - No tears or hysterics, she's going to... - Don't tell me, write it. Ok. - And Jimmy... - Yeah? - Nice work. - Thanks. How long has he been with us? The New York office sent him over about a month ago. According to Larry O'Connell he's a one man newspaper crusade. After watching him at the Hungarian embassy, I can believe it. Hey Sandy, what's the lowdown on the girl in Nick's office? I just made a bet with myself you'd ask that question. - So you won your bet, who is she? - Jeanne Moray, keep away from her. - Who's asking me to? - Nick might. - Oh, one of those things. - No, not one of those things, if your middle class mind can comprehend such. - Well, what then, engaged? - Listen Race, you stay out of this. We're kind of fond of both of them around here. Well, who isn't? I think they're swell. - Jan? - Hello Papa. Ah, you brought the cakes, good boy. - Everything is all right? - Fine Papa. Your sister called, she wants you to meet her at the shop. - I am busy, you better go now. - Grisha, copy in the city room. Kiss your sister for me, eh? Bye Papa. These files are a mess Grisha. I have some time later, I, I'll straighten them out. Thanks Sandy. - Something wrong? - You did all that with just soap and water? There ought to be a law. - You and Nick doing the town tonight? - We were going to have dinner, but... I've been outranked by the American ambassador, I have to settle for cocktails. Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing the conversation just now and I was... He couldn't help it, his ears grew two feet. As long as you've been stood up for dinner, how about me? - I'm sorry. - I'm an extremely graceful feeder. Hostesses fight over me, husbands even ask me back. Thank you no, I'm for a hot bath and then early to bed. You don't know how I missed hot water and deep tubs. Well, what about the two of us... Mr. Race, are you taking up a collection for something? Goodbye monsieur. Goodbye monsieur. Thanks monsieur. I won't be a second longer, send Race in. You want me? Your blast at the Hungarian ambassador, you're going to have to tone it down. Tone it down? He gave Anderson 20 years on a frame up. You want to play footsies with him? I don't get it. We haven't got the facts to back up your accusations. Neither did the Hungarian governments have facts when they convicted Anderson. This is a newspaper Jimmy, not an open forum in which to air your outraged sensibilities. We still going to concentrate on facts. Then why don't you send me to Budapest where I can get them? When the time comes, I'll see that you get around. The meantime I suggest that you relax. I'm afraid I'm not built that way. I can't remodel the paper to fit the way you're built. What about the interview with Mrs. Anderson? - Was fine. - Thanks. You look like a worker's revolution against the boss. Come on Sandy, if you promise to listen, I'll buy. Long as you're buying. I may not believe in what you say, but I'll drink... myself to death defending your right to say it. So the man wouldn't use your story, is that any reason to write him off as an editor? It's not just my story, it's the whole atmosphere. Nick and his policy of dealing with the communists like little gentlemen. If you ask me, I just don't think he's got it. Wait a minute, now you're getting into a fight. Henry, two more, doubles. Nick Strang didn't come up by the way of advice to the lovelorn, you know. He covered Dunkirk from the beach, a dozen revolutions... he was awarded the Legion of Honor, the Pulitzer prize. When was all this? When the world was young? Before you could carry a newspaper, let alone work for one. Why Nick Strang was a great newspaperman before you even finished high school. So, I'm buying the drinks and you're in his corner. How come you such a great fan of his anyway? Forget it. Just remember that he's had 15 years of experience over you. He's seen a lot of good reporters who had their careers... amputated by going off half-cocked. Maybe so, maybe so Sandy. Just the same, I get awfully tired of being polite. Well, I'll be seeing you. Tough, eh? He reminds me a little of Nick in the old days. Whatever happened between you and Nick? I always thought that someday maybe you and him, well... Please Henry, a good bartender lets the customer cry in his own beer. Oui? - Oui? - Bonjour madame. The man would you like to order dinner. I understand him, although you don't seem to understand me. That's my newspaper training, they taught me never to give up. No wait, what did she say? Now, what did he say? He said that... Oh, what does it matter Mr. Race? Good night. - Bon soir. - No, hold it. Ask him to wait one minute, will you do that? Just that. Miss Moray... I feel like having dinner with somebody and I want it to be you. May tell me, is that against the French criminal code? Mr. Race, thank you very much, but it's been a long day and... While you're getting dressed they... can be cooking dinner and when we get there it'll be all ready. No. No, I want to hear the broadcast from Budapest. We can hear that in your car, besides... what am I going to do with this? Very good sir. Excusez-moi. Are the only six words I know. This is radio Budapest with a special overseas broadcast... to our English speaking friends all over the world. The next voice you hear will be that of the Prime Minister... his excellency Andreas Ordy. I wish to make a brief statement concerning the light sentence of only 20 years given... to the American spy Robert Anderson. Convicted of espionage and sabotage against the Hungarian people's Republic. I hereby warn the western nations not to regard this leniency as a sign of weakness. They will come again, the spies... the prying saboteurs of warmongering capitalistic nations. But we shall fight their criminal intent to undermine Hungarian Democratic principle... with determination and fortitude. We shall be ready for the next one. We shall apprehend him, we shall try him, and we shall punish him as he deserves. The next American we convict of spying or sabotage against the Hungarian state... we shall hang. You have just heard a statement by his... I don't think it will win them any converts Mr. ambassador. But what are we going to do about Anderson? He was arrested by a government we recognize. That obligates us to respect their laws and their courts. Even when a man is so obviously innocent? We're doing all we can, but this case is far more complicated than it appears to be. Oh, he's not a spy, but there has been talk that he was involved in the black market. Oh? Well, that is a complication. Though that's not what he was tried for. No, but because of that it makes it difficult for us to act as firmly as we'd like to. I imagine they release Anderson quickly enough in return for some trade concessions. Or stopping the voice of America broadcast, that's precisely what's back of this. Anderson is a pawn in a much larger game. Unfortunately, that only makes it more difficult for us to help him. And I thought this was the one time we had a clear cut issue on which to make a stand. Sorry Nick, it's anything but a clear cut. Come on, let's go in to dinner. - From the gentleman at the corner table. - Thank you. Another member of the Jeanne Moray fan club? - You know that is Jimmy? - In a word, no. Anton Borvitch, one of the most important men in the Hungarian government. - I'm sure it won't hurt the champagne any. - I wonder what he's doing in Paris. Why don't we invite him over to the table and ask him some questions? Like how they got Anderson to confess, for instance. If I thought he'd answer questions I have a really important one to ask. - I have a feeling I'm being scooped. - Come on, what goes? It isn't a story yet, I tried to tell Nick about it, but he wouldn't even listen I'm not Nick, shoot. Well, the story is that Prime Minister Ordy of Hungary... met with Tito to discuss an alliance against Russia. Oh, I see, a little double-cross. Go ahead Jeanne, what else? Well, according to the underground, a photograph was taken at that meeting. If Nick hadn't made me come home I might've gotten my hands on it. Isn't that kind of dangerous work for you? Well, for a man who is not Nick, you sound very much like him. There's no law that says I have to disagree with him in everything. I'm glad Nick made you come back to Paris, if you'd stayed in... Mr. Borvitch? Please, mademoiselle Moray, how nice to see you. - I had no idea you were in Paris. - I arrived this afternoon. - May I present Mr. Race? - How do you do? Thanks for the champagne, what brings you to Paris? Oh, I see, a colleague. Mademoiselle, I was wondering if you could have dinner with me one night this week. Perhaps I can give you an answer to Mr. Race's question then. - Tuesday? - Tuesday is no good. - Wednesday, perhaps. - May I telephone you? Please do. However, if you can make it sooner I am at the Crillon. Good night. Good night. He seems a little anxious. Sounds as if he has a few questions he'd like to ask you. Shall we go? There's too much Borvitch in the air. Let's get away before it spoils our evening. Nothing changes Paris, wars, people, times. - Were you here during the war? - Here and the north, all over. And the underground? Ever killed a man? - I've helped. - Must've been pretty rugged. And you? What did you do during the war? Oh I jumped out of airplanes. - Paratrooper? - Yeah, north Africa, Italy. You've been through a lot. I got my basic training growing up on New York's east side. - You get used to fighting. - Your stories show it, I like them. What would you like to do tomorrow night? - I'm afraid most of my evenings are taken. - Oh? By Nick? Don't you think you better take me home Jimmy? Ok, but you may as well know I intend to keep on trying. Which means? It's been very nice, Good night. You were able to make a thorough search... through mademoiselle Moray's apartment last night? Yes, I found nothing. Oh, what about her purse? She might've concealed something in her purse. We searched all her belongings before she left Budapest, there was nothing. Could she have picked up something on her way to the airport? Not without my knowing it, I watched her constantly. Did anyone meet her when she arrived in Paris? No one. There was a message for her to call her office, that was the only contact she made. From the airport she came directly here. I want to speak to Budapest. Get me Vajos in Prime Minister Ordy's office. Use the private line. Very well, you may return on the next plane. Hello? Hello Vajos? - Yes? - Borvitch. You must be mistaken about Jeanne Moray, she took nothing out of the country. Did she attempt to contact anyone when she arrived in Paris? No. - Let me speak to the man who followed her. - But, I told him to return. - He sent him back. - I'll take it. - Borvitch, Ordy speaking. - Yes, your excellency. We've just learned that Gabor Czeki is alive. - But I thought... - Never mind what you thought. Mademoiselle Murray was in touch with the underground and then left Budapest suddenly. That's why we had a fallout. Then you believe she may have returned to Paris to contact Czeki? We cannot overlook any possibility. If she finds Czeki before we do it could mean the end for all of us. You must not let her out of your sight. Yes, your excellency, of course. - Yes sir? - Send in Franz and Kedor. Look at this photograph. It is Mmlle. Jeanne Moray, a reporter on the Paris Herald. I want to know every move she makes. Whom she meets, where she goes. This girl has been in touch with the underground in Budapest. She returned to Paris yesterday. And we believe she may be trying to contact Gabor Czeki. - Czeki? But isn't he... - No Franz. We have reason to believe that he's not dead, that he may be here in Paris. Mademoiselle Moray may lead you to him. I understand. And Franz, this time Czeki must not escape us. - She hasn't come in yet. - Oh, hi Sandy. - Something changed your mood, eh? - That's right. - Good morning. - Good morning Race. - Good morning Sandy. - Nick, I need five minutes right now. All right. Mr Strang, Budapest calling, they want you. Hello, this is Mr. Strang. Well, see that he gets the best possible care. And keep me informed, thanks. Dad, Barker was taken to the hospital, heart attack. Get up a list of possible replacements and contact AP and Reuters. Right away. Before you get snowed under I need your Ok on these, big fashion opening week from Friday. - You sure you'll get it back there in time. - Good morning. - No, all rested up? - Wonderfully. - Oh Sandy, very smart. - Nice, eh? I phoned you last night after I got through with the ambassador, there was no reply. - I went to the Chez Inez for dinner. - Oh? With Mr. James Race of all people. I forgot to call Patou, I'll pick these up later. How did that happen? Well, he just suddenly appeared at my apartment. You seem to have made quite an impression on our young friend. Oh please, don't try to make me out a femme fatale. I'm just a hardworking newspaperwoman and waiting for instructions. Have you any? Yes, I want you to go over to United Nations, Eisenhower is going to be there. Anything else? Then meet me at 4:30 sharp at Henry's bar for cocktails, that's an order. Eisenhower and cocktails, yes sir. Can you give me a lift? - Where are you going? - United Nations building. Isn't that strange? So am I I'm just going out to see general Eisenhower. Don't you think we ought to get started? It isn't possible you came to this decision after you saw the assignment sheet? Oh look, I've interviewed general Eisenhower many times, I just... decided I'd renew an old acquaintance. What's wrong with that? How about having a drink with me this afternoon? - I have a date. - What about dinner? Question, are you and Nick in love with each other? You haven't answered me. Were you serious before when you said that you knew general Eisenhower? Well, I'm always serious, what about you and Nick? He's a wonderful man. - Nick or Eisenhower? - Did you meet him during the war? No, I interviewed him when he was at Columbia university. - Are you in love with him? - Nick or Eisenhower? Ok, we're even. Are you? Just because we had dinner Jimmy, that doesn't give you any... I did more than have dinner with you last night. I fell in love with you. Do you remember asking me about the war last night? Yes. It was like you said, pretty rugged, I lost both my parents. Then the occupation, the underground. You get tired of emotional explosions. You look for something to believe in, you look for security. Security's like prosperity used to be, just around the corner. But that doesn't stop us from looking for it. Like you're looking for it in Nick. You didn't give him an answer when he asked you to marry him, did you? But Jimmy... Jimmy, it wouldn't be true if I said that last... night meant nothing at all to me, but don't you... - Please let me finish. - There isn't anything else to say. That Jimmy Race is all right. - What did he do now? - Went out with Jeanne. Got her a personal interview with Eisenhower. She called in quite a story. Did you want to see me? Our man Barker in Budapest is in the hospital. I need someone to take his place for a few weeks. I'm ready. Between the monitors and the censors you're going to... feel as though you're working in a straitjacket. There are ways of getting the news, even in Budapest. Yes, but a word of caution. It's all right if you can get the news, but don't make it. - When do I leave? - As soon as you've been briefed. - If you're sure you want the assignment. - I'm sure. Good. We'll queue your visa through the Hungarian embassy. Regardless of the reason I'm getting this chance, thanks. You're getting the assignment because I think you're capable of handling it. That's all Race. Ok. Yes, James Race. He has been with the girl constantly. If she knew anything about Gabor Czeki, she undoubtedly discussed it with him. Approve the visa, we will be expecting Mr. Race. - But continue to watch that girl. - Very well. Sandy, I just heard the news about Jimmy. Another old fashioned Henry. Aren't you taking it kind of big for such a short acquaintance? He'll get into trouble Sandy. Looks to me like he's been in and out of lots of trouble. But how could Nick do it? How could he send Jimmy to Budapest just... I don't think Nick's personal feelings had anything to do with it. - But I keep telling myself, but somehow I... - Alright. Suppose he did want Jimmy away for a week or two? So it's his way of asking you to think it over calmly before you rush into something. Is that so awful? And remember, I'm only supposing. Thanks Sandy. - Where are you going? - Home. - Don't you want your drink? - No. - What I'll tell Nick? He's coming over. - Oh, just tell him I had a headache. But that's exactly why I am worried because you're not afraid. - If you were a little afraid at least... - I'm a big boy now, I'll manage. But Jimmy, you can't behave there the way you did in the Hungarian embassy the other day. - If you do... - I got what I was after, didn't I? But that was in Paris, not Budapest. Look Jeanne... They've thrown Anderson in jail for 20 years, do you want me to forget that? Of course not. I only want you to realize how careful you have to be. Ok, I'll be nice and polite and obey all the rules. But you got information, how? - From whom? - I never knew any names. They'll get in touch with you but you never know what... side they're really on or whom to trust. Oh, I wish I hadn't told you about that Tito-Ordy meeting. - Stop worrying, will you? - But Jimmy, don't you... You never let me finish anything I want to say. I haven't got time. Even from the air, the once gay city of Budapest looked drab and grim to James Race. When he landed, he was told to report at once to the Minister of Justice. He did not know of course, that Vajos was taking a special interest in him. That the eyes of the secret police were going to be on him constantly. That if he got in their way... the Hungarian authorities were ready to deprive him of his freedom, even his life. - Yes? - Minister Vajos please. - Your name? - James Race of the Herald Tribune. - Race, how do you spell it? - R - A - C - E. - R - A - C - E. - That's right. Mr. Race is here. The Minister is expecting you. Thank you. Ah Mr. Race, you got my message. I'm delighted to welcome you to Budapest. - Thank you. - Be seated please. - I've been most anxious to meet you. - I didn't even have time to unpack. I think you'll find my papers are all in order. Mr. Race, we only wanted to assure you of our complete cooperation. Oh, that's fine. You see, it isn't often that we get to entertain one of our critics personally. And we feel that this may be one of the reasons... behind the misunderstandings between our peoples. Could be. Now you have the chance to report the truth. - That's what I had in mind. - What can we do to help you? Let me go anywhere I want and talk to anyone I please. But you don't need my permission for that. All right, when can I talk to Anderson? Unfortunately, he's already been sent to a work camp. It might be arranged at a later date. - The sooner the better. - Of course. It's been very nice Mr. Race. We'll have dinner as soon as you're settled. Yes, I'll be looking forward to it. Miss Oster, get your copy please. I may want to change this third sentence here. Be careful Mr. Race, I wouldn't make any changes now. I always rewrite my stuff right up to press time. But the monitors will be listening to you. If you don't follow the copy you sent them, they'll shut you off. We wouldn't want that to happen, would we? Mr. Barker was never able to change a single word. - May I see Mr. Barker? - Barker is in the hospital. I'm taking his place, can I help you? No, no thank you. - Hello? - Oh, just a minute. Oh Mr. Race, here's your call. - Hello? - Ready with your call to Paris. You will please adhere to the approved copy, go ahead. I got a little story about the Russian Hungarian military conference... that was originally scheduled for Budapest... but is now switched to a little town on the Yugoslav border. The Hungarians are on maneuvers there and it gives them a chance... to show off their army to all their neighbors. So next week's conference promises to be an important one... with the arrival of the new Russian general. - Have you seen Barker yet? - No, he's still too sick. So until tomorrow at three. Oh and say, tell our friend Jeanne that here in Budapest... America wake up every morning thinking of her. - These added words, America waking up. - These little things can happen sir. I'd say that he has a girl in his office. - How was Jimmy's story? - Very good, he sends you his regards. Alright Miss Oster. And love to girl with the wet Violet eyes. I am sorry, but you must adhere to the approved copy. These are simply personal messages. We can't make any exceptions, I'm sure you understand. Oh Mr. Race, are you enjoying your stay? Very much, except for one thing, I don't like being followed. Followed? You must be mistaken. I don't think I am. Ah? I see what you mean, we had you guarded at times. Against what? Some of our people have been very bitter against... the Americans since the Anderson trial, we have just been trying to avoid an incident. I haven't felt in any danger, from your people. Thank you for coming over Mr. Race. Oh Mr. Vajos, I'd still like to have that talk with Anderson. We haven't forgotten. Any message for me? The hospital called, you cannot see Mr. Barker today. - Try them again tomorrow. - Yes sir. Please, you can tell me how Mr. Barker is? - I haven't been able to see him yet. - Thank you. I am a dealer in antiques. Could you give him this with my compliments? My card. Yes, I'll see that he gets it. It's Race calling in. Put it on the amplifier, also tape it for Nick. Go ahead Race. Here's a story illustrating the genuinely fine things... being done for the Hungarian people by their government. Directly on the outskirts of Budapest, they're building a beautiful village... a lot like Arlington in Washington or forest lawn in California. The project provides modern housing for the workers... and will be available to the people for surprisingly low rents. I was out there yesterday and was amazed at the beauty of the locale. It looks like it's... straight out of the wonderland of those very famous children's stories. That's it for today. Jimmy's story sounds like a lot of double talk. Mr. Race... you are expected at the hospital now to see Mr. Barker. Yeah, I'm on my way. I'm James Race. Hello Barker, I'm glad you're feeling better. I'm not but I wanted to see you. - I'm leaving for Paris late tonight. - Oh, I didn't know that. Well, I'll get on with what I have to say. Nick seems to feel we've been neglecting the... picture side of the news since Jeanne Moray left. I haven't been neglecting the picture side, it's just that I got sick. - Perhaps you can do better. - I'd like to try. Fine, are you settled yet? - You know how it is in a strange city. - Well, there are some good restaurants. Nurse, which would you say is the best? The Volga Tea room or the Hungarian hotel roof, both very good. He's right, food is no problem. My trouble was always with cleaners. There's one right across from the hospital here. I tried them too slow. Fastest one I've found was a tailor named Laszlo Boros. I'll look him up. Tell him I sent you, you'll get personal attention. Thanks. I'll run along now, I'll be back tonight to say goodbye. I'm sorry, I'm an American, I only speak English. I understand you. - You Laszlo Boros? - Yes. - I'm James Race of the Herald Tribune. - Yes. Mr. Barker suggested I bring my cleaning here. - I understand he's been ill. - Yes, he's going home for a rest. - He's leaving for Paris tonight. - There's something you want cleaned? - I'd like to have this suit pressed. - I will have it ready in a few hours. Good. It looks like it's... straight out of the wonderland of those very famous children's stories. That's it for today. Arlington and Forest Lawn are cemeteries, that's obvious enough, but what... possible connection can they have with children's stories? Grisha, do you know any Hungarian children's stories? Stories by Bartok. - Let's see, there's Peter Pan. - James M. Barry. - Alice in Wonderland. - Lewis Carroll. - The little match girl. - Hans Christian Anderson. - Anderson. - Anderson. - Yeah. - Anderson, cemeteries. - Of course Anderson is dead. - That's it. - Are we going to run it? - Certainly we're going to run it. Nick, Jim might get into trouble. If he hadn't wanted us to use it Jeanne, he wouldn't have sent it. Turn it around and wait. - Is my suit ready? - Yes, I've taken care of it. - How much is that? - 10 florins. Thank you. Hotel Angaya. It's all right, we're ok. - Nothing. - He tried to get rid of you for a reason. He must've gotten something from the tailor. He wasn't out of our sight for more than 10 minutes excellency... And the tailor was picked up at once. We've only begun with Mr. Race, my car. - You can't come in here. - It's Ok, I spoke to the doctor. He left order that Mr. Barker was not to be awaken. That's all right nurse, I'm up. I'll do all the talking Barker, I've taken care of our picture coverage. I want you to be sure and give my regards to... Nurse please get the doctor. - Get the doctor please. - Well hurry, call him. Go ahead, get the doctor. - You get it? - Yeah, where's your passport? In my grip. Prepare for oxygen. - How is he? - You'd better wait outside. Mr. Race, I was hoping I would find you here. - Is everything all right doctor? - Just a spasm. Get me 100 milligrams of Demerol. - He will be able to leave tonight? - Of course excellency. Come with me Mr. Race. - All right, search the room. - What is this? You will remain quiet please. - Just a minute... - Mr. Race, I wouldn't interfere. - This man is very sick. - He'll be searched nevertheless. - I'm getting in touch with the American... - You're getting in touch with no one. You are under arrest. Who else was involved besides you and the tailor? Nobody Mr. Vajos. Me, I'm the lone wolf type. Mr. Race, don't you think your humor is somewhat out of place? I don't know, I think this place could use a couple of laughs. - What was in the lining of this coat? - Not that again. He's here? We'll continue later. Yes excellency? - This is your signature Vajos? - Yes. You read the story before you approved it. I've checked all of Race's material personally, excellency. You read this and saw nothing wrong with it? Idiot. Don't you know that Arlington and Forest Lawn are cemeteries? Can't you see that this is an announcement of Anderson's death? But excellency. This Race has made a fool of you, has made a fool of all of us. - I've made every effort excellency. - To do what? Organize a disaster? You've blundered from one thing to another. But the tailor, how could you let such a thing happen? You finally trap the underground contact and he commits suicide under your nose. We are investigating excellency. Did you also investigate Barker's mind before you let him leave the country? How do you know what Race said to Barker? Might've learned something about Czeki. - But they were alone only for a few seconds. - All that was needed was a few seconds. I will see to it that Barker doesn't reach Paris alive. I've already taken care of that. And now about Mr. Race. I want to interview him on the radio tomorrow night. Tomorrow night? But we had no time to work with him, to prepare him. That's exactly why it must be tomorrow night. I'm going to put an end to the accusation that we drug and... torture prisoners in order to get confessions. But how excellency? I want you to get several radio technicians. Men you can trust, dependable men. Yes excellency. - Go ahead Budapest. - This is the ministry of information. We have been instructed to inform you that James Race... is under arrest and is being held for trial. The details of the arrest will be made known in a special broadcast at 8:30 tonight. Prime Minister Andreas Ordy will interview Mr. Race. Get me the American ambassador, Biddle... put in a call to Larry O'Connell in New York and then go over to the Hungarian embassy... - and tell them that... - I know what to tell them. Nick, Ordy. Ordy himself, that can mean only one thing. I'll get him out Jeanne, I promise you that, I'll get him out. - Biddle just told me about Race. - Where is Barker? - Didn't he come in? - Yeah, dead. Heart attack they said, I don't like it Nick. He had nothing with him, no clothes, no luggage, nothing but this. Why should they hold his belongings? They were afraid he was taking something out. - Something that involves Jimmy. - I got the American ambassador Mr. Strang. Check the AP and Reuters. Find out if they've heard anything. Come on, we need a drink. We'll need more than one before 8:30. What is it with you guys? You keep me up for 30 hours, now you start asking me a bunch of simple minded questions. If you please Mr. Race, what was your purpose in coming to Budapest? I came here to replace the Tribune correspondent. And your job was to get information for stories? Yes, I was supposed to get information for stories... that's what a newspaperman is supposed to do, isn't it? - Coffee? - I don't like the way your coffee tastes. We won't keep you much longer Mr. Race, just a few more questions. You said you were a paratrooper during the war. Yes, I was a paratrooper during the war. And what kind of work were you assigned to do? I was assigned to do reconnaissance on military installations and communications. Look, I have nothing to confess. I'm not going to say I came here to act as a spy, so lay off. Let me hear that line again. Nothing to confess, I'm not going to say I came here to act as a spy. I want to use, I came here to act as a spy. I'm not going to say... I confess. I came here to act as a spy. Those two speeches must be tied closer together so they sound like a single answer. We are finishing with Race excellency. We will be ready to record your questions in about an hour. - This whole idea is brilliant excellency. - Thank you. - I confess I came here to act as a spy. - Very good. This is radio Budapest. We bring you a special broadcast in connection with the arrest... of James Race, American newspaperman. His excellency prime Minister Andreas Ordy. I am on the radio tonight in anticipation of the storm of protest... which from past experience I know will come as the result of the arrest of James Race. We will be accused of falsifying facts, of making groundless charges. However, to refute all this Mr.Race... who was arrested only yesterday, is here at the microphone with me... and is free to say whatever he wishes. Mr. Race, will you please identify yourself? My name is James Race, I'm a newspaperman. Will you tell us why you came to Budapest? To replace the Tribune correspondent. Mr. Race, what was your real purpose in coming here? To get information. To do reconnaissance on military installations and communications. Why were you chosen for this job Mr.Race? I was a paratrooper during the war and trained for this kind of work. In other words you came here to act as a spy. I confess, I came here to act as a spy. You realize the gravity of the charge you are making against yourself? I do. It is not our purpose to conduct a trial on the radio. We wished only to present the truth. He won't get away with it, do you hear me? He won't get away with it. It is expected that the Ministry of Justice will demand the death penalty. The arrest of Mr. Race as a spy... is the second incident of its kind to take place within the past four months. - Now how much time do you need? - Not long. Mr. Race doesn't care for our coffee, but he has to eat. I've seen to it that his food is properly prepared. You haven't eaten very much Mr. Race. You spoil my appetite. NY hidden microphones today Vajos? As long as you won't eat, shall we get on? Am I right Mr. Race, when I say that you came here as a spy? You heard my confession on the radio, what more do you want? - There is still the trial. - Who do you think you're kidding? All you want to do is break me down so I'll say what you want me to say. You're quite mistaken, all we're trying to do is to help you remember the truth. Even the cigarettes Vajos? You'd feel better if you ate something Mr. Race. You'd feel better if you ate something Mr. Race. You'd feel better if you ate something Mr. Race. You'd feel better if you ate something Mr. Race. Don't worry, he'll eat, it's only a matter of time. It's only a matter of time. Water Mr. Race? - Cigarette Mr. Race? - You do feel better, don't you Mr. Race? Let me sleep, let me sleep. - To get information. - There's still the trial. - To do reconnaissance. - There's still the trial. I came here to act as a spy, no, no. But the truth is you did work for the enemies of the government. - What did you get from the tailor? - You said I could sleep. - Of course you can sleep. - The truth Mr. Race, the truth. - Wake up Mr. Race. - What did you tell Mr. Barker? Answer the question, answer the question. - What did you tell him? - Wake up, wake up. There's still the trial, there's still the trial, there's still the trial. Mr. Strang, there is no picture of Mr. Barker in the file. Thanks Grisha, Jeanne... Yes? Jeanne, this piece you did on Barker, it's not what I want I know we've been running stories on him all week... but we must keep hitting the important points. Why did they hold Barker's belongings? Now, put some fire into it, pound at it. Why did they keep Barker's things? Why did they arrest Jimmy? Why are they going to hang him? I can't write it, get somebody else. All right Nick, I'll have another try at it. Get a blowup of this passport photo. I'll want to run it with the story. Biddle, get me the London coverage on Jimmy Race. Nick Nick, I've got it. This must be what they were looking for in Barker's belongings. It was under the passport photo. Grisha, get a projector up to my office at once. That's Vajos, the Minister of Justice. The one next to Tito, the man with the cigarette, is Borvitch. That's the picture of the Tito-Ordy meeting. Proof Ordy was making a deal behind Russia's back. All right, dad cut it. We run this picture we'll hang Ordy, Borvitch and Vajos. Ordy would give anything to keep his meeting with Tito a secret, anything at all. I think we know what we want in exchange. Rush some prints through, put that film in the vault. Call Borvitch and tell him we're coming over to see him. Quite a change to see one of them squirm. I don't understand Mr.Strang. Why do you come to me with this story of a so called Tito-Ordy meeting? Because you were one of the plotters Mr. Borvitch. Oh? Yes and unless you release James Race, I'm going to print that story. It is your paper. I presume you are free to print any rumors you like. What if we printed proof of this rumor? - Proof? - Yes. What proof could you possibly have mademoiselle Moray? How does one go about proving such a story? Very interesting, an excellent likeness of marshal Tito. I am glad you think so. Now, shall we discuss Mr. Race's release? But you know as well as I, photographs can be faked. And you know as well as I do that this is not. Personally, I don't recall the occasion on which such a photograph was taken. If I ran it on the front page perhaps the Russians will help you remember. Mr. Strang, your photograph shows what? A deal being made? I do not think so. All it shows is four friendly men. And you seem to have forgotten there was a time when we were all friendly with Tito. Anything else? Well, since you have nothing to add. Good night. - Oh, you forgot your picture. - We have others. Prime Minister Ordy, use the private line. We'll stop at the American embassy. I want the ambassador in on this. I don't understand it Nick. When Borvitch saw the photograph he was worried and then... Yes, there must be something else. If we could prove that the photograph was taken when... Stalin and Tito were no longer friendly. Nick, drop me at the office. Where's Nick? At the American embassy, he'll be here later Jeanne, international news just sent through a dispatch from Budapest. Jimmy goes on trial day after tomorrow. I have to check something in the files. I was going out for a bite but I could stick around. Thanks. Be back later Grisha. There is no need to look, there is nothing there. If you want to save Jimmy Race, go to 10 Rue de Galle. A girl will meet you there. - What girl? - My daughter. She will give you something, bring it back here. But no one must know. - But Grisha, I don't understand. - Please not now, there is no time. I will telephone her and tell her that you are coming. 10 Rue de Galle. - Mademoiselle Moray? - Yes. This way please. Here, here it is. Thank you Gogo. Hello Gogo. He's not here. Want to see your father Gogo, where is he? - I don't know. - We don't want to harm you. - But you must tell us where he is. - I don't know. I don't know where he is. Gogo, you think you could bear to see your brother killed? - I don't know where he is. - You're not in Budapest now. Geography can be a state of mind. Right now we are very close to Budapest. Suppose you tell us where Gabor Czeki is. You tell us where your father is. No, I don't know where he is. I don't know. Wait, don't. - I know where he is. - Please, don't. - Believe me Gogo, we've got to. - But they'll kill him. Telephone him. Herald Tribune, hello? Hello, hello? Hello Gabor Czeki? Czeki, this is Jeanne Moray. Tell him to come here at once, alone. Come to Gogo's apartment at once. Alone. Gogo. Franz. That's Czeki. - We didn't tell Papa. - I know. - I didn't want to, I didn't. - I know, I know. We waited a long time Gabor. - Grisha, I... - It was the only thing to do. What you did was right. But my children. - Nothing will happen to them. - I suggest you make no outcry. Papa. Papa. What could I have done? I was desperate. You must remember, I was Ordy's confidential aide. It was I who drew up this agreement for Ordy and Tito. You think Ordy would let me leave Hungary with this knowledge? You asked me Mr. Strang, why I did not tell you who I was? Why I did not come to you before? Two years ago the underground helped me to escape. I fled all over Europe, traveling by night, running from Ordy's secret police. For three years my children and I lived like hunted animals. I escaped them finally and when I learned... that Ordy believed that I was dead, I came to Paris. I came to Paris and I permitted myself to hope again, I thought, well... Now perhaps if I could find some way to get to America. I'll see to it that you all get visas, you'll go to America. There is no sanctuary anywhere on earth for a man like me. Stalin reached all the way from Moscow to Mexico to find Trotsky. I have only one wish. I want my children to be safe, I want them to go to America. Let me tell you something else Mr. Strang. You are mistaken if you think that this will save James Race. Ordy wants me too. The one man who could inform against him and whom the Kremlin would believe. I will go back to Hungary in exchange for James Race. But Grisha, I can't send one man to his death to save another. If it was that man's wish and if his... if his life was the only thing he had left to give to those... that he loves most, I think you could. Anyway, this is my decision. Get Mr. Borvitch at the Hungarian embassy. When you speak with him... you must make sure that the exchange be made at the neutral border, I know them well. No sign yet sir. They're late. No sign of them. Grisha, your children will soon be safe in America. That's it. - No, wait here. - Nick... I think it would be better. All right sergeant. - You're Nicholas Strang. - Yes. Mr. Ordy? At your service. - We agreed to come unarmed. - My personal bodyguard. The American embassy was worried about me too. You have Gabor Czeki with you. All right colonel. Well Gabor, has been some time. You changed somewhat. You seem quite the same excellency. Will you now produce Mr. Race please? Jimmy. What do you done to this man? He's over tired from the trip perhaps. I'm a doctor, this man is suffering from more than fatigue. You're free to make your own diagnosis. Nice work Mr. Ordy. Jimmy. There was one other thing. Gabor. Just a minute Mr. Ordy. There's one more condition attached to this exchange. The status of Gabor Czeki. - That is no part of the agreement. - Neither is sending this man to his death. I only agreed to deliver him. Don't let anything happen to Gabor Czeki Mr.Ordy. Not unless you want me to print that story. This is blackmail. Lean back Mr. Race. - I came to Budapest to act as a spy. - It's all right now, it's all right. - He'll be ok Mr. Strang? - They'll both be ok. So ends the story of an American newspaperman behind the iron curtain. A story out of the headlines of today, part of the headlines of tomorrow.
