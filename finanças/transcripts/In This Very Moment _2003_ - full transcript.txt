This very Moment A film by Christoph Hochh?usler Come on. Lea, Mom is giving us a ride home. I thought you were picking us up at school. I know, I'm running late. I thought we might go shopping and have a bite to eat there. Can't you go on your own? No, I can't go on my own. You have to come along since you have to try things on. But I don't want to come along. Lea, we had a deal, right? That was Papa. I don't really want to argue with you... Now, so please buckle up. But I'm not coming. Lea! You told Papa that you won't smoke anymore. Constantin, do you know this one? " Are you sleeping, are you sleeping, Brother John, Brother John, Morning bells are ringing Morning bells are ringing Ding dong ding..." You're not our mother, you don't have to sing with us. "Ding dong ding..." Good day, your passports, please. I wish you'd turn that thing off. - I don't know how. Give it to me, I know how. That's my watch! -But I know how to do it and you don't. For pity's sake, stop! You said we'd only go on a quick shopping trip. It's not much further. Stop that now! - "Stop that now." "Stop that now." Stop it! - "Stop it." - "Stop it." " Alright, that's enough now!"-" Alright, that's enough now."-" Alright, that's enough now." Very funny. - "Very funny." "Very funny." I have to pee. I really have to. - Yeah, sure. I have to go really badly. I'm going to wet my pants in a minute. Okay, out! Out, both of you! Shut the door! Sylvia! Sylvia! Lea! Constantin! Come on - we're going! Lea, Consti, - come along! Lea, Constantin, please come on now. We're going! I know you're there. Come on, now! I'm going now. I'm really going. Lea! Lea! Lea, Constantin! Yes. No, everything's okay. I've gone shopping. Alright. See you later. Shit! Hey, I found a frog! Yuck-itty-yuck! Yuck-itty-yuck! Yuck-itty-yuck!! He's so cute. Come on. What's wrong? - I got him. You killed him. - He would have been run over anyway. That's not true. Hey, he was dead already. Look, there's nothing on my shoe. I was only kidding, it was not your frog. He, Consti! Wait. Joseph! The kids aren't home yet? - No. Hallo! I want to sleep with you. I didn't even notice that you've started smoking again. I'll brush my teeth in a minute, okay? - Okay. Joseph? I... What? What's the matter? - I'm going to get something to drink. This is Mrs. Grellmann, Constantin's and Lea's teacher. Mr. Mattis, your children didn't show up for physical education class. Next time, please just let us know if something's come up. Just in case, my number is... 0162 - 592586. Good day to you. Why didn't they go to their phys ed class? Yes, Mrs. Grellmann, this is Joseph Mattis, Lea's father. I just listened to your message this minute. No, I have no idea. I'll be in touch. Where were you? Where were you, when... Edgar, is your mother there? Thanks. Mrs. Weil, yes this is Joseph Mattis. You didn'happen to see my kids today, did you? Today. No... they haven't shown up? Oh, dear. You'll let me know, right? Thanks. What are you doing? I'm going to look for them. Should I come with you? No, stay here, in case someone calls. Joseph! Piss off! Lea! - Get lost, you chicken! You're always so scared. Papa also said that you were under-developed. That's not true. You can't even tie your own shoe-laces. Besides, you're always tattle-taling... - You're always running to Papa to tattle-tale yourself. I only tell him when Sylvia does something wrong. - Other times too. When you peed the bed that time, I told him because you wet Papa's pillow. - That's not true. Is so, I saw it myself. Not true! Did anyone call? - No. They're sending two officers over right away. Where are you going? I'm going to put something else on. Wait, did the kids say anything today? - No. Did you guys have an argument? No, everything was normal. - If everything were normal... Where were you when Mrs. Grellmann called? - I was shopping. But you didn't listen to the messages on the machine. Because they're always just messages for you anyway. The children are missing, and you act as if nothing were wrong. You're a woman, and they're now your children too. You have no idea what goes on around here. You go get us something to eat. - But there's probably someone there. No. - And if there is too? I'm the boss. So, go. Let me go. Help, Lea! - German, eh? Will you stand still. Now you're afraid of me, eh? Will you stay here, or else... - Let me go! Put everything on top of this table. Everything on the table now! Was that everything? Nothing left in your pocket? Sit down. Sit down. Don't be afraid, only a small joke. And now... We'll have something to eat. You're hungry, aren't you? Do you want? Come on, don't be afraid. This is something to eat. What's her name, Lisa? - Lea. Lea. Lea, come on then. Your colleague is here too, and he's eating. There won't be anything left in a minute. My name is Constantin. - Constantin? Hi, Constantin. My name is Cuba. And suddenly Sylvia was gone. - Sylvia? Who is Sylvia? - Our mother. Not our real mother. When was that? This afternoon. I always used to take off too. Years ago. Consti! Get up. Put on your shoes. Yes, hallo, could I speak with Marion? Yes, I'll wait. Hallo, Marion. Not so good. Yes, I can. Yes. No. Okay. Bye. Yes, it's me again. Listen, I wanted to...What? Yes, I just wanted to take a sec... No, I don't think I can tell you. No, I won't be able to tell you tomorrow either. What? Yes. I understand, yes. Fine. Bye. Consti! Consti! Tell your sister we're leaving. I'll be downstairs, in the bathroom. I'll be ready in a minute. Are we going home now? I'm taking you to the police. The police... will take you home. Why aren't you taking us home yourself? - I have to earn some money. Don't you have any money? - If I did, I wouldn't have to earn any. Could we call our parents from somewhere? Do you know the number? I'll write it down for you. What's that? What does that say, "Two donkeys"! Aren't you two clever. But what's the area code? 0-3-5-7-6. Still no answer. Was it "two donkeys"? Or was it "sheep"? - No. Or "giraffes"? - " Donkeys". Hey, wait a minute. I'll show you something. What? - When flowers speak they say, yes... How do you say "Thanks"? Pull it three times. Look over there! Well... So you'll wait here. - And what about you? Me? I'll be right back. What's the matter? Nothing. They found nothing. I don't know who's responsible for this, but what human being would do... something like this? Joseph! We'll find them. Have you eaten anything today? Come on. I'll make you something to eat. And if they're dead, will you make something to eat then, too? They'll be back. I'm sure. Not even you believe it. ...no signs yet of 9-year-old Lea and her 7-year-old brother Constantine. The parents have offered a reward of 10,000 euro for any information... Ieading to the recovery of the missing children. For you. Hallo? I've heard of the reward. Yes, I know where your children are. Your son gave me your number. "Two donkeys", you understand, "two donkeys". How are they? Can I talk to them? Why? Why? In Poland? Yes. How? Yes. I understand, no police... But why... Don't worry, you'll get your money. Tomorrow. But... Did you hear that? They're alright. I'll pick them up tomorrow at noon, then they'll be back. I'll just go get the money. Children! Consti! Leave my brother alone! Piss off, all of you! Stop, no, that's so much money, you won't be able to count it all yourself. 1, 2, hundred million trillion! Two tickets to Germany. Germany, going home... We want to go home. Wait a minute. I'll ask a busdriver. Lea! Lea! Consti! Consti! I'll call you, when I have the kids. Bye. Why did you want to go without me? - I would have been back by tonight. Yes, but why? Your passports please. Merci. Hallo! - Mr. Mattis? Yes. No, everything's fine. Everything is good. Do you have the money? Okay, just follow these instructions: You drive to Skuschalewsk, to the last service area before the border. You wait there... ...on the parking lot at 6 p.m. Understood? What about my children, how are they? Let met speak to them. No... No! Hallo! Hallo! Where is Constantine? - I don't know. I'll bring you home. Let me go. Let me go! I don't want to go, let me go. I want to wait for Consti! Get in. Stop that. Go ahead, they're good. I want to eat something healthy. - Not now. - But I want to. No. Then I'll tell them you did something to me. What did I do? What did I do? You little monster... Do you want to blackmail me? I want to eat something now! There... That's all that's available. Hey, I'm eating. I'm eating. Help, this man is holding me prisoner! - Lea! That's enough! There he is, Consti! Consti! Whatever happened to you? Okay, get in! Okay, young man, in you go! Consti! You stay here. - Why can't I go with you? - Because you'll just do something stupid again. No! I'll be right back. It's cold! Cold! Consti! He's never going to take us home. We have to get out of here. You're so strange, why don't you say something? Where have you been? Consti! Will you help me? If you still like me, then pinch me. Alright, time for a nap. What's the matter with you? Joseph? Yes? You seem so far away. But you're not going away, are you? You won't leave me alone? I won't leave you alone. Never? Never. I love you. I never thought I'd have this much good fortune in my life. That wasn't good fortune. No. Joseph? Go on, get out. Beat it. Get out. Get lost.
