(people chatter) - Quiet flight for a Monday, and I don't mind it a bit. - Let me guess. You had a wild weekend. - Always. - That depends on how you look at it. - Margie always has a good time when there's a man around. - At least I can talk about it the next day. - I enjoy it for itself. - Have you girls ever tried doing it standing up? - No, you're kidding! Did you do it? - Ask Mike. I had him standing on his toes. - Ooh la la. - I don't see how you can do that, Barbara especially with your height. I mean your angles are all wrong. - Ask him. He's not shy. - Forget it. I'll just take your word for it. - Hey, how about some coffee? And make it hot. That last cup that reached me up front must have come by way of the North Pole. - Complaints, complaints. You know we're not good at making it hot. - All right. It's Monday, and you win. Now, who's gonna do it. - It depends on what you want done. Okay, I guess it's me. Come on. - [POD] Huh? - [Boy] What time is it? - What's all that talk about standing up you girls were assessing? - What big ears you have, grandma. - Janey, you're such a tease. But you know what it's all about. You know, you got a good head on that pretty body of yours. - I understand you've got quite a head yourself, but I still don't believe it can be done standing up. - Come here. (sensual music) - No. No. - [Passenger] Where's the hostess? (upbeat rock music) J' Here we go J' J' Rollercoaster of life J' J' Here we go J' J' Rollercoaster of life J' J' You can change your mind J' J' But it's too late to get out J' - Hey, do you know where I can get a ride to LA? - Hang around. Maybe you'll find one. J' Put your head on my shoulder J' J' But you know, I got on tight J' - Fill 'er up? - Yeah, and check the oil, please. - Hey, where are you going? - LA. - Can you give me a lift to Studio City? - Well, yeah, but I've got to make time. - [Scott] Where are you from? - North of here. - [Scott] Where are you going? - South of here, LA. - No, I know that. I mean, what kind of work are you gonna do there? - A massage parlor. - That's funny. You don't look like a hooker. - What do you know about hookers? You don't even look like you can afford one. - Sweetheart, I don't have to afford one. - Oh, proud stud, I suppose. - Yeah, sometimes. - Look, can we change the subject? I'm Debbie. - [Scott] Scott. Hey, listen. What's your thing? - [Debbie] I haven't found it yet. But school isn't it. Two and a half years at state proved that. I'm joining the airlines tomorrow. - Stewardess? - Mm-hmm. I start at seven a.m. - What made you choose that? - It's something new, meeting new people, free travel, a little excitement. If I don't like it, I'll try something else. - And what about mommy and daddy? - They don't give a damn what I do. So whatever I do, I do. It's up to me. - Right. (guitar music) (doorbell rings) - Hi, I'm Debbie Stewart. I guess we'll be rooming together. - [Jane] I'm Jane. Come on in. - Okay. - Welcome to our little nest. It isn't much but we call it home. Debbie, meet Barbara. - Hi. - [Debbie] Hi, Barbara. - If you wanna know anything, you just ask Jane. She'll give you quite an education. - Oh, no, thanks. I already had one. - It's all in the game. Come on. Let me take you to your room. (upbeat music) (knocking on door) Come on out. We have a guest. - Male or female? - [Barbara] Female. _ okay- - This is the blue room, as you can tell. I hope you find the accommodation suitable. - Hey, it's nice. It's a little nicer than my dorm was. - Hi, I'm Margie. - Hi, I'm Debbie. - Hi, Debbie. Listen, Debbie, these are my things. I'll move them out of your room this afternoon. - [Debbie] Sure. - Qkay? It's really not bad here. There's only four of us. And we share everything, you know, never getting in each other's way. Like if you have a date in from out of town and no place to go. - That's a nice thought. I'll keep it in mind. _ okay- - Come on. - Wait for me. - Where do you come from, Debbie? - Kansas City. That's Kansas City, Kansas. I'm not from Missouri. - Why'd you join up? - Well, since you asked, I joined the French Foreign Legion because my girl left me for a millionaire. - That's Wild. Do you swing both ways? - She was only kidding. Weren't you? - I'd be happy to swing one way for the right guy. I've been bored by every campus Romeo that state college has to offer. Baby, that's a turnoff. - Oh, a candidate for the easy life. Let me tell you something, Debbie. The work we do is pretty hard. And as for men, it's the same everywhere. The choice is yours. - Yeah, but at least in this profession, you get a better crop to choose from. H9)'- I got a hot date tonight. Will you help me get ready? - The usual, madame? A shave, a manicure, a haircut? - I'll skip the haircut, but I'll take the other two. - All right. - Excuse me, Jane. Can I use the chair? - Certainly, for you, yes. - Thanks. _ okay- - I've never seen that done before. - Oh, it's nothing new. Marge does it all the time. - Men love it. - Oh. That's really freaky. It does look clean. - Madame, for the skin he loves to touch. - Thank you. - (chuckles) God. - Hey, I'm going to the store. Do either one of you want anything? - Yeah, some foam. Would you get me some? - Sure. - We're having a birthday party for Jane tonight, and we're gonna let her make the cake. - That's some surprise. - Wait till you see the cake. (upbeat music) (people laugh and chatter) - [Margie] Ah-ah-ah, mustn't touch. - [Woman] You're eating too much! - [Woman] Oh, my g0d_ - [Man] Hey, let me taste that. - (shrieks) That's cold! - They mean well, but their heads are somewhere else. - I know what you mean. - Don't get me wrong. If I get a little smashed, I'm likely to do anything. (upbeat music) (people laugh and chatter) - [Women] Eat your heart out, Burt Reynolds. - Oh, look at that! This is fantastic! (laughs) - [Woman] Happy birthday, Jane. - Happy birthday, Jane! Are you gonna blow out the candles? - Come on, Janey, blow the candles out! - [Man] Blow 'em out, come on. Make a wish, make a wish. - [Woman] Come on, Janey. It's your birthday, baby. Have a good time. - [Woman] Make a wish. (group cheers and applauds) (upbeat music) - [GFOUD] Whoa! - [Man] Lower! - [Man] Oh, look at that girl go! (group cheers and applauds) Oh, look at that go! - [Margie] Debbie. Hey, what's wrong? - This just isn't my scene. Marge, you can dig it if you like, but it's just not for me. - Listen up, Debbie. You're safe. - Yeah, you're right. How small town can I be? Imagine, I'm so provincial that the thought of making love to a naked man in front of strangers just makes me sick! - [Man] Can I have some too? - Oh, sure. Here, have some. (laughs) (group laughs) - [Group] Oh! ' Yes? - You know, sometimes you mean well, but things always get screwed up, like when you have roommates, when you think you know them but you really don't. - Yeah. - I guess it's true, Debbie. We did give you kind of funny a introduction to a stew's life. But it's not always so bad. I used to have wilder parties than that when I was in school. - That's just it, Margie. You're not in school anymore. Don't you wanna do anything with your life? - Sure I do. I'm gonna find the richest man in the world. - And what are you gonna do with him? - Marry him and everything he has. - Dream on, sweet princess. - That's not a dream. If you want it, you get it. - I'll get it. - Hey, what's the matter with Jane? - Oh. She do things at night. You know, she loves 'em. (Margie chuckles) But the next day, she hates herself and anyone within 10 feet of her. J' Here's something I wanna tell you about J' J' If you feel like a ride J' J' Get on this rollercoaster J' J' If you stand up, you'll fall out J' J' If you lie on the floor, you'll miss out J' J' Just find yourself a seat J' J' No matter where you are J' J' Go up and down like a yo-yo J' J' Know you're gonna go far J' J' Storming along J' J' Storming along J' J' I said storming along J' J' I said storming along J' J' Here we go J' J' Rollercoaster of life J' J' Can't go slow J' J' Rollercoaster of life J' J' Don't say no J' J' To the rollercoaster of life J' J' Hold on tight J' J' It's the rollercoaster of J' J' You don't have to worry, baby J' J' Keep your head and you will be all right J' J' Listen to this J' J' Hold on tight 'cause here we go, oh J' IOhJ' J' Don't stop now J' J' Rollercoaster of life J' J' Hold my hand J' J' Rollercoaster of J' J' Don't look down J' J' Rollercoaster of life J' J' Don't stand up J' (upbeat music) - Have a pleasant flight. Thank you. - Hello. This is your seat right here. - We had the whole plane to ourselves. - Hello, can I get something for you? - No, we're fine. - [Man] Fine, thanks. - Sir, can I take your coat and hang it up? - Yeah, sure. - It'll be right here in the closet and I'LL give it to you at the end of the flight, okay? - Okay, thank you. - Oh, excuse me, miss. We'll have to put that down under the seat. Here, I'll get it. Thank you. - And we got served two meals. (man chuckles) And it was during Thanksgiving when we went over. So we had turkey and dressing and everything. - Hello, can I do something for you? - No, I'm fine right now. Thank you. - All right. Sir, is everything okay here? - [Man] Yeah, thank you. - Are we on time? - Sure. How far are you going? - About as far as your friend will let me. She has my tickets. - Here you are, sir. Have a nice flight. - I'm sure I will. - Sir. - Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah. - Now there's an old man with money. And I think he likes girls. - Really? I think he's just Being nice. - We'll see. (Debbie chuckles) (engine whirs) - Sir, can I give you more coffee? - No, thank you. - [Debbie] Okay. Coffee, sir? - No, no, thank you. - Sir, you don't look very well. Can I get anything for you? - No, thanks, I'm fine. Thank you. - [Debbie] Okay. - Now, that wasn't bad for an airline steak. Of course, when you're hungry, they all look good. - Yeah, it's all the same to me. In my field, I'm on and off planes so much, I can't tell the difference. - What kind of work are you in? - In TV sales, cartoons, children's shows, you know, like Zorro. - (chuckles) I never miss it. Oh! Hey now. - [Man] What's going on? - The man's had an attack. Get the oxygen. - [Man] What's going on? - [Margie] It's okay, sit down. Could you put your seatbelt on, please? The man's just a little ill. We have it all under control. Could you relax? - [Woman] What's he hitting him for? - Ladies and gentlemen, could you please sit down? Relax. Everything's under control. - Yeah, yeah. - Sir. He's looking better. - Let's hope so. - He certainly was lucky to have a doctor sitting next to him. - I'm no doctor. - Well, how'd you know what to do? - Courtesy of Uncle Sam. I learned a lot more in World War ll than just how to kill. - I never thought of it that way. Everything happened so fast today. Do you realize you saved a man's life? - Well, saving people's lives is not exactly my specialty, but I'm glad I could help. - Just glad you could help? You're an amazing person, Mr. Brewster. Do you mind me asking what kind of work you do that keeps you so alert? - Well now, in the first place, the name is Ben. In the second place, pleasure is my work, and having cocktails with a pretty young girl is my specialty. How about it? - That sounds very nice. - All right. - Do you live alone in this big house? - Oh, I have help when I need it. Look, Debbie, you don't mind staying here alone with me, do you? - Of course not. I'm looking forward to a nice evening. - You make yourself comfortable. I'll be right back. I wanna change. _ okay- - [Ben] Diane! - Hi. - Hey, who let you in? - Some memory. Have you forgotten the key you gave me? - Touche, but you weren't due here till tomorrow. - I know, but a girl has the right to change her mind when she's in the mood. And Ben, dear, I am in the mood. - Well, I'm sorry I can't say the same. I'm just not with it today. And besides, my niece is here. She just came in from the, would you believe, airline. - Airline? - Yeah. - Sounds to me like you're back after stewardesses again. How could you? That's so fickle. - That's not it at all. Hold that pool. I'll be right back. (Diane chuckles) (chuckles) You shouldn't have. I'm the host here. Besides, you've done enough serving all week long. - That's all right. I was just admiring your home. It's beautiful. - Well, I like it. I've lived here about 12 years. You see, I never got married. Oh, I've been close, damn close, but I never found the right girl. - I'm sorry to hear that, but I think it's their loss. (knocking on headboard) - Oh, that, that, that's my dog. See, she's very jealous and demands a lot of attention. But I'll go up and quiet her down. - Can I help you, please? I love dogs. I love 'em. - Oh, she's mean and vicious, nothing but trouble. I'll be right back. All right, all right, I get the message. - Look, we both know what we have going for us. Raw sex. So take your shirt off and come over here. - You know what I love about you? You're so damned honest. - Why not? It's always natural with us. - When sex rears its lovely head, who am I to argue? (laid back music) (Diane moans) - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. - Oh. - Oh. Oh, this feels nice. (moans) - [Ben] Oh, yes. Yes. - [Diane] Touch me, yeah. Squeeze. (Diane moans) God! Ben. (Diane moans) (Ben moans) (Diane moans) (Ben grunts) (Diane moans) - I'm so sorry, Debbie. First, the plumbing went haywire, and the dog gave me trouble. It's rough when no one's here. I have to do all the servicing myself. - I understand. Don't feel badly about it. I enjoy relaxing sometimes. - Well, I'm glad to hear that. - I've been admiring your house. It's very interesting, but also very revealing. For instance, your gun case over there. What's all the artillery for? - Oh, amusement, sports, protection. You see, I'm a land developer, and my work takes me into some pretty rough country sometimes. - Do you shoot anything? - I don't get the chance very often, but I'm a pretty good shot. Now for instance, if anybody tried to break into here, I'm ready for 'em. - That's scary. - Debbie, how long has it been since anyone took a real interest in you? I don't mean just as a pretty girl, but the one with the hurts and the pains and the secret thoughts. I'd like very much to know that girl. - That's very sweet, but there's nothing that special about me. - Well, I think there is. I think you're not like the other airline girls. I think you want something more than just a good time. I think you've been hurt badly. Debbie, I'd like to see you smile a little more. I'd like very much to know that girl. (engine whirs) - [Debbie] Take me to the Sheraton, please. This town sure looks exciting' - It's just because you're seeing it for the first time. - [Debbie] Very smart. I'm sure you get a lot of girls in from the airport, don't you? - Nope, don't like stewardesses. They all talk the same, you know, like high school girls on their first date. - [Debbie] I know what you mean, but you can't generalize people in any area. Just because we're between five foot two and five foot 10, it doesn't mean we're all the same. - Show me, hostess. I suppose you're one of the exceptions. - [Debbie] Maybe so. I just started, you know. - [Cal] It looks to me like a girl like you could be successful at anything she wanted. You ever tried modeling? - [Debbie] (chuckles) Sure. - Well, you see, I studied facial features. You've got a lot to offer, you know. You could really be good at it, honest. What the hell is the matter with you? Didn't you see me there? - [Driver] You're gonna have to get out of my way, mister. I gotta go to the store. - Well, get out of that car! Get out! - [Debbie] Are you okay? - Oh. - [Debbie] Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Oh, look, I'll have to leave you here, okay? Forget about the charger. I gotta go home. - No, let me come with you. I know a lot about first aid, please, okay, 'cause you're hurt. _ okay- This is it. - Sit down and let me look at your head, okay? It doesn't look as bad as it did. You'll be okay. - Well, I could have told you that. Anyway, I appreciate the help. Really, I do. - These are beautiful pictures. - When I'm not a cab driver, I'm a photographer, only I'm the only one who knows it. A guy's got to eat, so I drive a cab. - I know what you mean. I work for a living too. But why can't you get a job? - Because I don't want a nine to five job. I wanna freelance. I'm trying to break into the fashion field, you know. And well, I don't have a good enough portfolio yet. Would you pose for me? - L\/Ie? (chuckles) I've never done that before. - It's easy. Will you try it? - Yeah, it might be fun. (soft music) J' Look at all the colors in the rainbow J' J' Listen to the ripples as the stream flows J' J' Come and fill your cup with holy water J' J' Come and give your body to the rain J' J' Children, come and play with mother nature J' J' Try and catch a raindrop is the game J' J' Won't you say hello to mother nature J' J' Can't you hear her calling out your name J' J' Can you touch it J' J' You can touch it J' J' Can you see it J' J' You can see it J' J' Can you hear it J' J' You can hear it J' J' Now you feel it J' J' Hey la hey hey hey now J' J' Hey la hey hey hey now J' J' Now you see J' J' Hey hey now J' J' Now you hear J' J' Hey hey now J' J' Now you feel J' J' Hare Krishna J' J' Hare Krishna J' J' Hare hare J' J' Hare Rama J' J' Hare Rama J' J' Hare Rama J' J' Hare Rama J' - Well, I sure had a wild day today, but I don't know where we got all the energy. There's just one thing I was curious about. Why didn't you ask me to pose nude? - Now, why did you ask me that? - I was just surprised. I mean, I wouldn't post nude maybe, but if you asked-- - Well, I'm not asking. Now drop it. - Cal, I was just making conversation. - Look, the subject just doesn't interest me. - You're a fashion photographer. The female body should be interesting to you, unless it bothers you for some reason, or you're afraid of something. - All right, if you're serious, then take your clothes off. J' Look at all the colors in the rainbow J' J' Listen to the ripples as the stream flows J' J' Come and fill your cup with holy water J' J' Come and give your body to the rain J' J' Hey la hey hey hey now J' J' Hey la hey hey hey now J' J' Now you see J' J' Hey hey now J' J' Now you hear J' J' Hey hey now J' J' Now you feel J' J' Hey la hey hey hey now J' J' Hey la hey hey hey now J' J' Now you see J' J' Hey hey now J' - I feel so free. Perhaps by taking my clothes off, I took my mask off too. How about you, Cal? - Debbie, you are the most gorgeous and alluring woman that I have ever dreamed about. Ah, not now, Debbie. Just don't know pry, okay? - Hey, Cal, I've got feelings too, you know. - Yeah, well, feelings are great if you have 'em. - [Mike] You know what happens to the first one who drops it, don't you? - Okay, smartass, tell me later after you win. - They just get cooled off, that's all. - Oh, you're the one can use some cooling down. Voila, Coca-Cola on the rocks. - Come on, get on with it. - Don't rush me. You're supposed to enjoy this. It's your game, you know. - Ah, that's cold! - Wait a minute. It's not empty yet. - I love it, every inch of it. - Oh, now, Ev, where have I heard that before? - From me, and you never get tired of hearing it. - YeP- I guess it makes me feel good to have someone dig me. But you know, I don't know you that well. In fact, you're still a mystery to me. Ev is something you never talk about. - Look, baby, you know I dig you, your body and your mind. That's enough. So now, you tell me. Why can't we put the pieces together? - God, here we go again. Look, everything is fine just the way it is. I am not ready for a house with any white picket fence. - Look, who says the fence has to be white, right? Oh! (Barbara laughs) - White picket fence. (laughs) No, Ev. No, Ev. (shrieks) - Boy, that stuff was really cold. - Serves you right. You would have done the same thing to me. - Yeah, but you can use some cooling off down there. Don't you ever get tired of sex? - Come on, Mike. The Victorian age is over. Women enjoy sex today, and there are a million ways to enjoy it. - Yeah, but do you have to try every instrument in the orchestra? - (chuckles) I guess I'm just a one-girl band. I like different men at different times. I like a change of pace. - Well, why don't we change the pace at my place tonight? You can play any song you want. - If the instrument's in tune. (doorbell rings) - Cal, what are you doing here? - Delivering your pictures. - Hmm. - Can I come in? - Sure, come on in. Do you always deliver your pictures personally? - No, but I can make an exception in the case of my favorite model, can't l? - Hey, that's very flattering, but Why'd you really come? - To see you. - See, I've been looking at the pictures and thinking about you. The pictures really came out nice. When I was looking at 'em, it was like, it was like you were looking back at me. You were the day we shot 'em, you know. - How'd you feel when you were looking at them? - Turned on. - Cal, you really take good pictures. You should have a better model, but you know, I think you shouldn't have any trouble getting work in LA. - Well, I hope you're right. - I think so. Hey, listen, a friend of mine is giving a party. You wanna come? - Sure, why not. Where is it? - Palm Springs. - I'm your man - Good. - Ben, your place is absolutely beautiful. - Well, I'm glad you like it. I'm doing a little remodeling right now and it's coming along very well. I wonder what's keeping Debbie. She left about the same time we did. She should be here any minute. - Well, I'm happy to hear it. - Whose place is this? - [Debbie] A friend of mine's. Why? - Just wanna know. Who is he? - He's Ben Brewster. I met him on the plane. - How old is he? - Hey, what does he What does that matter, Cal? - I just, i just wanna know. - I guess he's in his middle 50s. - Yeah, I thought so. I thought so. (laid back music) - [Debbie] Ben Brewster, I'd like you to meet Cal. - Oh, hi. - Hi, how are you? This is a nice place you got here. You know, I used to have a place like this. - Oh, when was that? - Another lifetime, I guess. - Come on, baby, let's groove. This party is dull. (laughs) - I'll make it undull for you, daddy. - Oh. (Ben chuckles) - If you two will excuse me, I think I'll go get a drink. - Right over at the bar. Help yourself. Well, Debbie, lwas beginning to think you weren't gonna make it. Who's your friend? - He's a photographer I met in San Francisco. - Oh. - I hope you don't mind if I brought him to the party, Ben. - (chuckles) Not at all. The more the merrier. (laid back music) - Do they have any scotch around this place? - There's a bottle. Pour your own. - How'd you get invited to this gathering? - This girl brought me. - Oh. The chick there talking to Brewster? You dig that old man? - Would you? (Ev chuckles) ' [Jane] 9h, Wow! J' When will you be mine once more inside my head J' J' When will you come back to me in my bed J' J' I am never quite certain of where you are J' J' But I know you are never very far J' J' Take my heart again J' J' Break by heart again J' J' Do you want to say you do J' J' I'm a liar but I can be true J' (Debbie and Ben laugh) J' Take my heart again J' J' Oh, break my heart again J' (Ben chuckles) - I better get Barbara a towel. - Hey, what's happening, man. What's your game? - Photographer, looking for work. - Stills or movies? - Both. - [Ev] You need bread? - You show me a man who doesn't need bread. You got a job? - I might have something for you if you wanna work and not talk about it. - Well, I hear you talking. - [Ev] Shot many films? - A few. What do you got? What's the story about? - It's about the same old thing, man, ballin'. This is hardcore. Don't give me any arty bullshit. - Just like that. I mean, you don't wanna do something better? - Look, we've been shooting pornos now for two years. When we're done, put the film in the can. We get paid, that's it. I don't care what we shoot, boy-boy, girl-girl, or both. Kids come in and do a job, that's all. What the guys back East do with the film is their business. - Well, how do they show that kind of stuff? - They spend more money on lawyers than they pay us. They'll set up phony ridiculous complaints in court and they have them thrown out. That opens the market, then they bring in the hard stuff. Our films will play coast to coast, just like the big movies. You want in? - I need the money. When do we start shooting? - [Ev] Tuesday. I'll give you the address later. - Cal, enjoying yourself? - Yeah, it's fine, it's fine. - What's bothering you? - Look, I don't know why you brought me here. I don't really need this scene, you know. And what's more, I don't like your friend, Brewster, either! - You don't even know him, and I don't know why you're acting like this! - Look, it's not him. It's us. - There's not that much between us, and I don't know why you feel this way. - Look, you were bare assed at my place. That says a lot, okay? - That doesn't say a damn thing! And I don't know what's in your head, but man, you come on in a strange way! And I think there's something wrong with you! - What's the matter? - I shouldn't have brought him here. - Now, don't get excited. After the rest of them have gone, you stay. Everything's gonna be all right, right? - [Debbie] Okay. - Thank god they're gone. I thought they'd never leave. Debbie, you're a charming sight for these tired old eyes. - They're not so old. They're certainly not tired. You know, I see the devil in your eyes. - Are you sure you don't mind staying over? - Of course not. You're kinda like an uncle to me. - (chuckles) I don't know if I fit the role of uncle but I'll try. Would you like to see your room? - I didn't bring an overnight bag. - No problem if you don't mind sleeping in a man's pajamas. - No strings? - No, buttons. (laughs) (knocking on door) Are you decent? - [Debbie] Yes, Ben. Come on in. - [Ben] Well, hey, those pajamas never looked that good on me. - Maybe it was starting a new fashion trend. No bottoms this year. - Ah, So be it. You know, Debbie, seeing you tonight makes me feel like Methuselah. The book of Genesis tells that he lived to be 969 years old. Sometimes I feel that old. - I'm sure many girls would like to be with you. You'd know what to do for her. - Well, I'm not into so many girls. J' Yeah, yeah J' - Your hands are very warm. And I can feel what's in your mind, and you've got wild ideas. J' Inside my mind J' J' Sang with the song as it flowed along J' IMmmI J' Just sit and remember J' J' Stories your mother once said J' J' At the foot of your bed J' J' Gone to a place called sleep J' J' Dreaming at dawn J' J' In the land of never J' J' Dreaming at dawn J' J' Blessed with the praying sun J' J' Dreaming at dawn J' J' Sleep to the sweet lullaby J' - That was the most delirious, wonderful night I've ever had. - No regrets? - That's a silly question. No, no regrets. - Then I'm glad. - You really know all the answers, don't you? You are the most charming liar I have ever met. - Oh, really? - Really. You've got your routines down to a science. And that must work on all the girls, doesn't it? - No, not always. I'm alone a lot. - Not by the looks of your house. One female can always tell where another has been. And Ben, you've had many others, haven't you? - Maybe so, maybe not. But oh, sure, I'm always interested, but so what? You ever heard about being alone in a crowd? - Hi, Margie! - [Margie] Hi! - How's the weather up there? - Fantastic! - Good. - I'm in the mood to do something. Hey, who's your friend? - You remember Ben. He saved the man's life who had a heart attack. - Oh, Debbie's being very kind. Anybody could have done that. - Don't be so modest! You must have known the right techniques. - You did a beautiful job, perfect. - Debbie, you better hurry. They're having a special briefing inside. - Oh, nuts I don't wanna have another briefing. I've had too many already. - Listen, don't worry about it, honey. It's just more red tape. _ okay- - Qkay? - Ben, will I see you later? - Sure. _ okay- Margie, I'll call you, okay? Bye-bye. ' BYe~bye. - Qkay_ - Well now. I'll take it any place you like to go. - Well, it's such a beautiful day. I don't wanna go home. Where are you going? - [Ben] Would you like to come along? - [Margie] Sure. - Well, all right. - [Margie] Do you like Debbie? - I think she's a hell of a nice kid. - You know, somehow I picture you as the kind of a man who, well, enjoys a more adventurous kind of girl. - Well, it all depends on the situation. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. But I'm, different types interest me. - What about the type who shares your interests? - I doubt if any girl can share all of a man's interests. - I don't mean hunting and fishing, football. I mean the more private kind. - Very few women can follow all a man's interest in the same private sports. A woman takes a more direct romantic course while a man wants something a little bit different and exotic. - Not all girls are alike, you know. I for one appreciate a man who has exotic tastes. - [Ben] Oh? - [Margie] In everything. - [Ben] Mm-hmm. That is very interesting. - You've got everything you want here, don't you, money, properiy, chicks. - [Ben] As simple as that, huh? - Sure, no problems that I can see. - I don't know about that. There are times when a person realizes the big ship never came in. Oh, sure, on the surface, I've got it made, I keep telling myself. (chuckles) - Listen, when you were young, did you ever think about who you were gonna be, you know, right now? - (chuckles) I think everybody thinks about that. I wanted to be a lawyer. I thought there were so many things in the world that needed straightening out that perhaps I could help. - What happened? - I found out that something things can't be straightened out. You take the kids of today. They wanna destroy everything. My generation worked awfully hard to get us where we are. - Yeah. - Well, sure, it's far from perfect, but why ruin it? - Everything is so far out. - Like what? - Well, like everything, the real world. Sometimes I just wanna forget about it, go into my own world. I never tell anybody that though. You know, they'd think I was crazy. - I don't think you're crazy. - Well, see, life to me is just one big orgasm getting stronger and stronger. I guess that's why I meet so many men. - Does it work out for you? - What? - The men. - No, not yet. - You know, somewhere, people get lost. - What people? - Well, a lot of the kids. You know, if I was a parent today, I'd shoot myself or somebody. - Why? Don't the kids listen to you? - Well, you're listening to me, aren't you? No, I don't mean it that way. Some of them have gone too far. I mean, like the skyjackers, the militants, that bunch. We don't lean on these people enough. They see the coast is clear, and they take advantage. - [Margie] Okay. So what? - So what? You see this little beauty? That is a Weatherby. It's my pet gun. If more of us were ready, they'd think twice. (phone rings) - Hello. - Hi, Debbie. This is Cal. How are you? - Hi, Cal, I'm fine. - Listen, you'll be glad to know I'm working. I'm shooting a film. - [Debbie] I'm glad. - Yeah. Well, look, I, I thought maybe we could get together for dinner tonight, you know. - Cal, I'm busy. - Look, Debbie, I've missed you. - Please don't say that. - You're going outwith Brewster, aren't you? - No. - Look, you only want his money. What do you want, to be a pretty rich bitch too? - Cal, don't talk like that. - Well, look, I want you to get something straight. You haven't heard the last of me, not by a long shot. This isn't the end of it. - [Cal Voiceover] Would you pose for me? - [Debbie Voiceover] Yeah, it might be fun. How'd you feel when you were looking at them? - [Cal Voiceover] Turned on. - [Debbie Voiceover] A friend of mine is having a party. Do you wanna come? - [Cal Voiceover] Well, who is he? - [Debbie] He's Ben Brewster. I met him on the plane. - [Cal Voiceover] How old is he? - [Debbie] Hey, Cal, I've got feelings too, you know. - [Cal Voiceover] Well, feelings are great if you have 'em. - [Debbie] I think there's something wrong with you! - Look, man, if you can't cut it, let me know and we'll get somebody else! This is costing me. - All right, all right. All right. Anytime you're ready. - Okay, let's roll it! Five weeks of shooting, and today, you almost blew it. - Look, I got something on my mind, okay? - It's that bitch, Debbie? - Yeah. - Look, I, I got a score to settle with her and her friend, Brewster. Look, you ever heard of the People's Liberation Front? - I heard they had a group here in LA. - Well, yeah, they do, see. And I've been a member for five years now. We've done a lot of good. We help a lot of blacks. And we, look, we help a lot of Chicanos. And we help a lot of guys in prison. And we did it all with money we ripped off people like Brewster. Now, I've got a plan to rip Brewster off, but I need your help. I think I can get, I think I can get him at 50 grand. And look, I'll split it with you 50-50, okay? (Ev laughs) - 50-50. Cal, aren't you forgetting something? You work for me. You and I both know there's no way you can pull this off alone. Without me, your plan is dead. - What's your price? - L get 2/3. You do what you want with the rest. - Oh, man. - [Margie] I've got a few hours between flights, so I thought I'd drop in and see you. - I'm glad you did. I'd like to show you my special room. This device is my version of the Parisian pendulum. Very popular in the French brothels during the turn of the century. You see, the older patrons could get high stimulation without too much effort. I have been trying to perfect that divides for six months. No luck. Either I get the wrong girl or I get the wrong timing on the motor. - Oh, egads, man. You're as freaky as I am. (chuckles) Hey, wanna try it? - We'd better test it first. - Did you build that yourself? - Aye, lassie, that I did. - Shall I climb onboard, captain? - [Ben] Yeah, I'll just raise the mast and lower the stern. - Are you ready? - YeP- - Oh! - Get yourself comfortable. (upbeat music) That's it. NOW, hold tight, hold tight. (Margie and Ben laugh) - [Margie] Oh, my god! (Margie shrieks) (Ben groans) (Margie and Ben laugh) Oh, my god! Well, fix it. - [Ben] I can't, I can't, I told you. Oh, look out, look out! (Margie shrieks) (Margie and Ben laugh) - I guess we better stick to the good old fashioned way. - [Debbie] I am so tired. What a flight. - Oh, there's nothing like a quiet weekend to relax you. - With guys? - Hey, that's the only kind of party to have. Besides, I think you need a change your pace, Debbie. How's your love life lately? - Not very good. Cal's too jealous. He's got too many problems. - Well, you've always got Ben, haven't you? - I haven't seen much of him lately. - [Jane] Listen, in 14 minutes, the tram is gonna take us from the boiling sun to the freezing snow. There's nothing like it anywhere. Wait, you'll see. J' As the dancing candles J' J' Place patterns on the wall J' J' A silhouette in darkness J' J' ls that all J' J' Something here inside me J' J' Takes me up on a flight J' J' With silver wings, I travel J' J' Through the night J' J' Don't ask me to come home to you J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' Don't ask me, I'm not asking you J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' Don't ask me if I feel the same J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' Don't ask me 'cause I'm not to ble-eh-eh-eh-ame J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' If I was to tell you J' J' What I really feel J' J' You would not not believe J' J' That it was real J' J' Now the bond is broken J' - [Debbie] Oh, come on. Let's get out of here. J' Nothing left to say J' J' Don't ask me to come home to you J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' Don't ask me, I'm not asking you J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' Don't ask me if I feel the same J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' Don't ask me J' - [Barbara] Hi, Ev. J' 'Cause I'm not to ble-eh-eh-eh-ame J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' Don't ask me to come home to you J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' Don't ask me, I'm not asking you J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' Don't ask me if I feel the same J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' Don't ask me 'cause I'm not to blame J' (wind howls) - [Debbie] What are you doing here? - Well, I'm not waiting for a bus. - Hey, what's happening here? - Business, baby. Sorry. You two, sit. Sit down! 0K3)'- Welcome to our little, shall I say party? I want you all to listen 'cause I'm only gonna say this one time. If you all be good little ladies, nobody will get hurt. But if one of you get out of line, you've all had it. Okay, you, Debbie, come with me. - What in the hell are you doing? - Look, shut up! Move, move! (ominous music) (phone rings) - Yeah. - Brewster. Ben Brewster? Listen and listen carefully. We have your girlfriend, Debbie, here and two other stewardesses. We need $50,000 by this afternoon or no one will ever see them alive again. - You've gotta be kidding! - No, I'm not kidding, man. Ask your friend, Debbie. - Ben, I'm sorry. Please try to help us, please. - Qkay? - Oh, look, let the girls go. I haven't got $50,000. - Then I don't care, man. Get it! Mortgage your house or something, but get it. And don't call in the pigs. I'll call you back this afternoon and let you know, and I'll let you know where to deliver it. - What's up? - Oh, some punks want $50,000 ransom or they're gonna, the girls are gonna get hurt. - Debbie? - Cal, can't you and Debbie settle your differences without all these hassles? - [Cal] I'm sorry, sweetheart, it's gone too far for that. - [Jane] How did you get a name like Cal? - If you really wanna know, my parents gave it to me. My real name is Calvin Wilson Robinson Ill. - Oh, a blue blood. What happened to all your money? - Well, my parents cut me off when they found out I was dropping acid. I don't know why, ljust, you know, I've had a couple of accidents, that's all. - Families are like that. - Look, you asked me and I told you. Now, I don't need your smart remarks! - Oh, keep your shirt on! We were only trying to make conversation. Besides, we got a lot of time to kill. What's with this liberation movement you're involved in? - What difference does it make? - Oh, number one, I was active in movements myself in school for four years. And number two, I almost got busted. And number three, I cringe at the thought of all the trouble we caused a lot of people. And you know, most of it was just for kicks. - Well, lady, mine is not for kicks! I'm gonna help a lot of people. I'm gonna help a lot of people who just can't help themselves. - Cal, if you feel so strong about your cause, why don't you try to act in a way that society might accept? - Because it's a rich man's world. That's all that counts. It's money. Nobody will listen to me without it. - Isn't there anyone who'd care about who may get hurt by what you're doing? - My family, that's for sure. - What's your trip with Debbie? - Look, I told you, just stay off my back! How'd it go? - Everything went just fine. We've got Brewster scared, and I'm sure he'll come up with the money. - Ev, Why'd you and Cal wanna go do a fool thing like this for? - Baby, there is no way for us. I'm into the man back east for 10 grand. I've got to get him off my back. - That's your problem. - Pretty girls always get on. But for me, it's different. I need the bread. I clear myself with the man, and I keep some for myself. That's it, plain and simple. - You're all wet. You know, if Keep going the way you're going, you're gonna blow your whole thing for sure. - How's that? - That big black face of yours plastered on the front of every newspaper all over this country! You know what it's gonna say? It's gonna say another nigga gone bad. - Go on, I'm listening. - It's your turn. You break the silence this time then. - I'm just a poor kid from the ghetto. My father died when I was five, and I never had nothing. - Same old story, huh. - Same old story. - How did you get hooked up with him? Hey, he's just out to use you, man. (Ev laughs) You know, you'd be al all right guy if you just would play it cool. (Ev laughs) You find that amusing? (phone rings) - Yeah? - Brewster, do you have the money? - [Ben] Yeah. okay- You take the old Mill Creek Road. Follow it to the end. I want you to turn left. Go about three miles. At the top, you'll see an old cabin. I'll take it from there. And Brewster, please, come alone. - At least now, I know where they are. - Hey, baby, come on. You're taking a chance with some people's lives. - Look, Marge. If anything goes wrong, they can have the money, but I'd sure hate like hell to see those bastards get away with this. - [Margie] Hey, wait for me. I'm coming with you. - [Debbie] Cal, what's the matter with you? Why are you doing all this? - We're here now and that's that. - Cal, please call Ev off and let us go, please. - I can't. It's gone too far for that. - [Debbie] What's in your mind? - You still don't understand. I've been thinking about you. You're my chance. You're the one chance I've got, and I won't let you take that away from me. - [Debbie] Why are you doing this? - I'm impotent! I'm a freak! - I don't understand. - They told me in the hospital that I had a chance. Don't you see? You're my chance. - What does this have to do with me? - I need you. You're the answer. You're the only way out I have. I need you. - I can't help you. - You're just another young girl who's hung up on an older man, and I think it's sickening! - You stupid bastard! What do you know about anything? Sure, Ben has a lot of money, more than you would ever have, but I hate you on, and get the hell outta here! (ominous music) - Sit your ass down! (Debbie sobs) - Get out. Leave me alone! (Debbie sobs) Please, don't! No, please, don't! - It sure didn't take you very long to get the money. - [Ben] My credit's good. You know I got the feeling that Debbie wants part of this action. - [Margie] Debbie? - [Ben] Yeah, Debbie. - [Margie] That's ridiculous! - [Ben] I don't know about that. $50,000 can be very tempting. - You don't really believe that or you wouldn't be here right now. - You stupid fool. I told you no bitch was worth it. Yeah, just, just don't preach to me, okay? - [Ev] Preach to you, Cal, no. But if you blow this setup, man you're dead. - [Cal] Don't you understand? We blew it. We've already blown it. Now let's leave it. - [Ev] What the hell's the matter with you? You know I don't leave here without the money. - Look, Ev, we're gonna let 'em go. - Look, punk, nobody cops out on me. Today is payday, and that's it. So get it together. Brewster should be here anytime now. (suspenseful music) She's getting away. Look, you keep an eye on those two. - Dirty bastard. - What are you doing? - They're gonna come out of that cabin pretty soon. And when they do, poof - My god, Ben, that's cold-blooded murder! - No, it's justice. Those punks have been asking for this. Kidnapping is punishable by death, and I'm taking over. - Honey, just call the police. - And let them get off scot free for lack of evidence? Hello, no, sister. Hell, no. - Baby, please, you're scaring you. You almost act as though you enjoy it. - You said it, I didn't. - But Ben, Ben, please. - Marge, stay out of this. - Hey, look, Ev, Ev. It's over. - Get off of my back, man! Look, I'm tired of your crying! - Come on, let's, let's just, just let her go, okay? (suspenseful music) - That's right, boys. Walk into my corner. - Ben, stop it. I can't let you do this. This is insanity. - Marge. What the hell are you doing? - Debbie. Everything's gonna be all right. (gun fires) - Oh, my god. God. (laid back music) How much more time will it take to put the pieces together? Where do I go now? Nowhere? Or everywhere? (engine whirs) J' I know where I'm going J' J' Far across the sea J' J' I don't need your shouting J' J' Or your sympath)' J' J' Doesn't really matter J' J' What I say to you J' J' You never ever listen J' J' When I spoke to you J' J' As the dancing candles J' J' Place patterns on the wall J' J' A silhouette in darkness J' J' ls that all J' J' Something here inside me J' J' Takes me up on a flight J' J' With silver wings, I travel J' J' Through the night J' J' Don't ask me to come home to you J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' Don't ask me, I'm not asking you J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J' J' Don't ask me if I feel the same J' J' Don't ask me J' J' Please don't ask me J'
