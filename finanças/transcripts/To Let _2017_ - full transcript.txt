Thanks for taking me out. I would be meeting someone next week, I told you. If all goes well , we can go abroad. Daddy, power gone. Wait, I'll come. Daddy, don’t you fear darkness? No. Big Dinosaur? Never. You fear Mummy only. Daddy, draw a sparrow? Daddy its tickling.. It's tickling.. Uncle, my mummy calls aunty. Amudhaa, house-owner wants to meet you. What for, at this time? Ok, take care of this dosai. Water is not at all coming. Also tell her about blockade in toilet. (TV) Evening, my husband phoned. But you didn’t answer, it seems. We were in the beach. It was noisy there. I have been thinking of telling you. Daddy, I am the lion. You are the mouse. Right? Now, run. Hey mouse, lift me. Amudhaa! Amudhaa! Shall we have mummy also in the game? Ok, we can include. Where is your mummy? Amudhaa! Can't even prepare a dosai. He has blackened it. What’s the matter? What happened? It's you I am asking. These days the woman speaks nonsense. If I ask her to switch on the water-motor she dislikes it and frowns. If I dry our clothes in the terrace, all our clips go missing. Raised the rent as usual? Wants us to vacate. Saying all too suddenly. Of course, they will. Are you keeping us in a palace? Hey, mouse. Why are you standing here? The lion Is here. Just run. Shut up, or I will beat you. Go somewhere. At least three months’ notice to be given to the tenant, you know. Should drag them to court. Rubbish. She stand right in the middle of the street and shout, you know. Straightaway she asked us to vacate. And that’s it. Don’t fuss Siddhu. First, let’s leave this locality. We should vacate before 4th of May, she says. Damn her, who is she to give us a month’s time? Let’s find a new house and go in a week’s time. If we give two hundred rupees more.. We can get a house near to your school. Siddhoo! Listen to me. "In good and bad times.." "Let You be my loving mother" Stone.. Paper.. Scissor. Stone.. Paper.. Scissor. Stone.. Paper.. Scissor. Stone Stone.. Paper.. Scissor. Daddy! Say bye to mom. Bye! What is your name?

I will give the key in the ground floor. I'll be back by 12.30. Am I her servant-maid? Leave me. Last night you didn't care of what I spoke. With who else can I share? I can’t be here even for a minute. I feel ashamed. Ma'am.. house for rent? Hey man, show him the house. Greetings, mister. Rent, four thousand. Forty thousand, advance. Apart from that Rs.300 for cleaning the front yard and drawing ‘kolam’. Maintenance Rs.500. Power charges.. Rs.6 per unit. Agreement for 11 months only. After that the rent would change. Daily the water motor would be on between 6 and 7 a.m. Within that time you should store the water you need. Do you understand? No screw and nail business on the walls. Your T.V volume should be low.

Vivitha! Siddharth! Lohith! Let’s delete all numbers Shalini. Let us part. Enough of this game. He came from this side and she came from the other side. Deleting the numbers? Look at me and say. Is this just a game to you? Come, let us eat. Feeling hungry. Were you in love with some Shalini? It's the name of a character in the movie. I like the name. Thats all. If I had cheated by not marrying you, what would you have done? A scene before the intermission. Always story for you, no? Next week, I should tell the story… So much concern for those in the story. Show at least a little of it to those by your side.. This sounds great! Say it once again! Once more Oh, please eat. I don’t like paying 1 month rent as broker’s commission. If we try a little harder, can’t we find one? Wait.. let me check. People have come to see the house. Go, have a look. How's it doing? What’s this, dull-run in the city also? They said there is fight, sentiment, comedy – everything. It was aimed at non elite people. Damn it, spending crores and crores and making a movie – still, no returns at all. See the evening collection and then call me. Greetings! Fine We will have big artistes and make a grand movie. Ok, Sir. Contacted any hero? No, Sir. I will call him up. Go and see. After New Moon day. Come and see me after 15th. - Right? - Ok, Sir. - Bye. - Thanks sir. When you go out, give the key to me. Yesterday evening two came to see the house. How can I show it to someone if you lock and go out. Ilango, there is a bag at the back. Take it. There is a bottle inside. This is the product. Pickles, sir? Yes, Maavadu of our soil. Write three or four concepts on it, will you? Yes, sir.. Don’t write the usual stuff. Write an emotional story. Big Agencies are competing. Have this in mind and write.. Give the basket. Has he slept? Yes. He has won a prize in drawing competition. Kept awake to show it to you. I scolded and made him go to sleep as he has school tomorrow. Next year this drawing will come in his school diary. Tomorrow our boy’s school closes. Should pay the fees. Mm… You have it right? Jewel loan interest for this month? Only recently you paid. That was before six months. Let’s manage somehow.. Today I saw a lady in the park. She spoke of some MLM. We pay 1000 rupees initially and get some more to join the scheme. We will get ten thousand every month. I too want to try. I am telling you. No..no, are you going from door to door and beg? If I say something, will you scold me? Mmm.. Off it for a moment. Tell, I can hear. Your degree would fetch you real good job abroad, they say. Earning for two years there. You can build a house of your own and then turn to your cinema.. Won’t you leave me in peace for a moment? Chatter box! Alright Tell. Please watch the movie. That is much more important. You spare me no time at all. I have to keep awake waiting. And you would return at twelve. And watch movie.. - Ready sir. - Ready! Just give ‘effects’.. soon as he hit. Make sure you are in sync. Give it a lengthy voice over. He should wail 'Aaaa' with pain and fall. - Ok, sir. Ready for the take? Wait some more days Amudha. I will come up in life. Have I been with you all these 6 years without faith. Where-from you got so much of money? I am asking you. Madcap. Sir, tolet board is there. Vegetarian? T..O..L..E..T! Dad! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Dad! Is this TV ours? Yes. Your vehicle? - Mmm… - Mmm means? Tell me.. Yes. Indeed! Then, why this house is not ours? - Raasu, is this the house? - Yes, sir. You brought me to the burial ground? It is a lucky locality. Two bodies would come daily. Auspicious sign, no? Why man, leading me into a cave? No window at all. See the house and tell, sir Tall buildings surround the area. That's why…. it has turned dark. But rent as you asked, just three thousand. Current bill would be minimum 30,000. What man, not at all coming to office? Siva sir, I have come to see a house. I will call in the evening. Okay.. What? Sri Lanka? Ilango, sir. I see. Let it be. Movie-making or anything else. I don't care. But, I should get the rent on third of every month. There is a tenant. See the house if you wish to see. If you like it, give advance. In one week I will have the house vacated for you. - Do you worship God? - Yes sir. Why are you wearing black shirt? Don't wear that colour. What are you? In movie industry... Sir.. He will promptly pay the rent sir. Nobody will come to see him. No bad habits. By 'movie industry'... He implies He is a writer. He writes script for movies. He writes story for weekly magazines. Be seated. Your native place? Sivagangai, near Madurai. Well… what group? Sir? Caste.. Pillais. I see. I enquire all these and then only bring them to you, sir. Rent 5000. 10 months advance. Sir, our budget is 4500. Brokers say that we can demand 7000 rent. For commission they raise, sister. Rent is something you decide on. Now you both are now kith and kin. We can reduce the advance by 5000 rupees. - What do you say? - Ok. House is in next street. Go and see. Thanks, sir.. If rent alone is 5000... how can we give current-bill, maintenance and all? What do you mean 'How' somehow we have to. School van comes to the doorstep. You remain at home and complaining. I wander in the scorching sun… I keep telling - no regular supply of water... toilet gets blocked… We are not staying here free of cost. We pay rent every month. Why did you break the cellphone, dad? - I will go and ask. - Wait.. I said 'wait'. What uncle? Mummy and daddy have gone out. Want to say anything, uncle? Give it. Let's give token advance now. Let's ask for a week's time for the advance. Greetings, sir Sir, we have seen the house. they like it. So, token advance…. But, it is rented. Sir, you said just a day before. That's why, we saw the house. and have come to pay a token advance. An IT guy came. - We have rented the house to him. - Sir! Sir! I tell you It is no more available. This is not fair, sir.. How dare you raise your voice? I tell you that the house is booked. Bringing film people he speaks on being fair and just. I spoke with the hero. He said he will give dates for us. Can you give the script? Take your time to think over. One thing. Your name won't be there as script-writer. Instead, I'll give some money. Maximum of 50,000 rupees. Ok? This month you have recharged the phone thrice. Filled up fuel four times. Need to pay the rent. Day after tomorrow Kavin's birthday. My sister informed. We should do something for that. Interest for jewel loan… - 'How much we have' - I asked you. Did I ask for accounts? Why keep asking 'how much I have'? Whatever is left is what I have. Did you give me one lakh? Do I spend anything for myself? Growing age, but, the boy looks horribly anemic. No proper food. As if I am spending everything.. What at all is right in this house? Not able to earn a penny. Why do you people need a family? I'm the one to blamed for trusting you. Why are you shouting now? It is you shouting. You don't like to hear the truth. . Hey, what’s this? Speaking word for word I will do exactly... Sorry! - Leave me, I am going. - Listen, Amudha. - Leave me. - Listen to me. - Where are you going? - It's not of your concern. I can’t be with you. Leave me, I say. Leave me. Listen! Leave me, I say. Let's settle it by talks. Leave me. I said, 'Don't go'. Turn slightly left. Hold it straight. Cut cut…glare comes on the product. Check it out. Wife? - Yes, sir. - Married how long? Six years? Did you find a house? If I say cinema, no one is willing to give sir.. Yes Indeed, that problem is always there. They entrust the very state in the hands of film-stars for the past 50 years. What a contradiction?! If you look for a house above 10,000 rent range, there won't be any problem. But, there is the budget. The same problem we face in cinema also. - Tried in 'classified'? - No sir. You have to. Buy Saturday Hindu. Free Ads and there are many more. Paper will arrive at 5 AM itself. As soon as you see an ad, talk to the person. Is there any deadline? We should vacate before May 4th. If we don't vacate in time.. They would make life hell for us… I faced the same problem when I was looking for a house. But, I managed. Excuse me,sir. Director wants the script pad. It's a script. What to do? Our intention is not to cheat, Ilango. After all, we are going to give the same rent as they do. What to do? My cousin's company only. If you face any trouble.. Only your name will be changed in this.. Let it take ten years. Just buy me one house. That's enough. Mm.. In the front yard a little space like balcony. Siddhu would grow plants. A swing in the hall. A room for you to write in peace. A room for Siddhu. Slightly bigger kitchen will do for me. Siddhu studies well. He will go abroad and all. Let him marry the girl he likes. We shouldn't tell anything, ok? Very much like our parents did. Once he gets married... He will forget us. He won’t, will he? Mm.... If I tell you one thing, you shouldn't get angry. Tell me. Each day money is spent like water. No one to help. Shall I go and request that lady of the house. Request what? Increase the rent if you want. Let us remain here for some more time. I don't like you going and begging anybody.. I am of no help to you. If you had married a girl from a well- off family…. Hey! What are you talking? Stand firm. Zip… Shall we pin it up? Jake.. Out.. Go out! Still searching for a house? We did see…. but.. But.. what? You are not searching for a house to buy. Filled up the whole house with things.. Papers stuck on all walls. Why all these scribblings, boy? Can anybody who comes to see the house like it? How many more I have to show the house? So dirty this house is. What Amudha? There is time till the 4th. I am not speaking to you. I too don't speak to you.. If you don't vacate by 4th.. I will show you who am I. Excuse me. One Hindu paper. Siddharth, in which class you are? UKG. My grandson will be like this one. - No.. - Get it. We built a big house by getting loan so that we can stay together as a family. But, my son has gone abroad as job is more important for him. Now, we can't even pay the EMI. My husband is a retired teacher. Pension is not much. We somehow manage with the help of this rent… After advertising in the Paper many come to see. But, we should like them, shouldn't we? Four months rent as advance is enough. You can use both the rooms. There is a terrace also.. Rent? Broker brings people for 10,000 rupees. But you can give 7000. That's enough. Daddy, start going. Sir! Now in Kaliyammankoil street. We will be there by 10.30. Sir.. What happened? We are supposed to be there exactly at 10.30 "When I live hundred years in world" "When I live hundred years in world" Daddy, start the bike. "I afford one day live in your holy place" "We have no life without you my Lord" Upstairs! That house only! Sir! You asked us to come at 10.30 - We got delayed. - It's over. We have let out the house. This is the house. They asked us to come at 10 AM. But, not answering the phone. Sir, house owner is there? He is on the way. We are also waiting. Come here. Why didn't you say "I don't know"? Why are you so naive? What is wrong in telling? What has come of you, Amudha? So good you are. You're running around for more than a month. Has anyone given you a house? Let me answer the call. Greetings, sir. - Regarding house Ad in Free Ads... - Amudha? - Yes sir, Amudha. - Tell me. - We are standing at your doorstep sir. - We are yet to start. - Can you come after two hours? - Ok, sir. Start the bike. They are yet to come. We will check another house and come. - Which floor, sir? - Eighth floor. You like elevator? Will you be with me? You can go in elevator hundred times a day. Will you be with him? We saw an Ad regarding house in Free Ads. Yes. Rs.16,0000 for a 3BHK. Can you afford? We talked to sir regarding a single bedroom … Greetings, sir. What’s this? Didn’t come for 2 days? Work is pending. - When will you wind it up? - In 2 days. Speed it up. Come inside. Dad, lift me. Kitchen. Hello kid! Cute boy. - Thanks. - Welcome. Downstairs, it was full of parking We have turned it all into a single portion. Upstairs, both the floors are ours only. Where is your house-owner? Upstairs.. Right above our house. We have been in the same house since 5 years. Great. Being in the same house for so long? This is a new house. Take care of wall, floor and all. - Maintenance is very important. - I am a house-wife only sir. I will take care of it as my own. Your family has three members only - right? - Yes. There won't be many guests. - Ok, this is your number? - Yes. I will call you by three. - Moorthy. - Sir. - Finish the work soon please. - Ok, sir. Sir, token advance. No problem. I will give a call. Sir, we have come first. - Waiting for three hours. - Ok madam. Let me talk to my mother and then call you. Ok, sir. Daddy, will you buy this house itself? Stop the bike. If I say something, you shouldn't scold me. - What? - Go to that street once again. Hello!. We are calling from JP properties. Where you want the land..? Did you share the number? Low price it said. That’s why I gave the number. Its him. - Sir. - Good evening, sir. Regarding the house.. Yes. You are a Hindu. Yes, sir. - Tamil? - Yes, sir. Veg or non-veg? Sir.. Damn this mobile.. Go out and speak. Sir, line got cut. We are non vegetarian. I am now in my mother's house. I will talk to her and call you back in ten minutes. Sir… sir. What happened? Sait will give us house. We are shifting to a new house. I am thinking of giving the story. Don't pledge. Just sell it. After all , we don't have a daughter. If we come up we can buy hundreds like this. As soon as we go to the new house.. I will get a job. Some receptionist job that can fetch me 3000 or 4000- enough. So far I was hesitating for this one’s sake. Now, he has grown up. If I leave the key next door.. Returning from school he would manage being alone at home. Or else we will buy a computer on EMI. We can manage somehow. We came to this city empty-handed. Haven’t we come up this much? Don’t sell your story. Just to take a two hour film.. How many hours we have to wait in life, sir? Keep waiting. I can wait, sir. But, why Amudha and Siddhu? Stress and sense of guilt... Are the raw-materials for artistes. Have you read Chaplin's auto biography? No pain will last long, Ilango. Don't let go any minute. See how you can turn it all into a story. Let’s go. Keep this. This too. Thanks, sir. Surely I will repay it in six months somehow. Do the work Ilango, we will manage. If you are in need.. Don't hesitate to ask help. Not at all a problem. Sir, bag. - Hello. - Mm… I've come. I am there only. - Sir. - Greetings. Actually, I said on my own that rent is 5500. I discussed with mother. Shall we have it roundly as six? Let it be 5500 itself, sir. - After one year you can.. - New house.. It would easily go for 6000 in that area, people say. No change in the advance. It's the same 40,000. Ok sir, let it be. Ten thousand is enough. When we give the key, you can pay the balance. I will have the agreement typed. Give your ID proof, current address proof. The Tamils here are new to us. So our auditor wants it. Just a formality. Please don't mistake me. Give the rent before fifth, every month. Thursday we perform Ganapathi Pooja. You and your wife should attend without fail. Agreement will also be ready then And I will give you the key then itself. Thanks. Be a good boy. Only then I'll get you ice-cream. We have got a house. Fourth morning, I will hand over the key. It is not proper to ask you to take it from the advance. This is rent for this month. Should give advance to the new house. Our advance with you..
