Hey... I'm pissed as hell and you're here eating ice-cream? You better figure something out. I'm figuring out nothing. What's this? --What the fuck is that? "Playboy"... We're dropping 'em. This shit is a bomb... a BOMB! Faster, Vittò! Faster! I'm in heaven! Let's get more! --Let's go! Excuse me... You can't pass. --Why? --You need real jackets, not these things. I gotta see someone inside... --Only 5 minutes... He said you can't pass, will you please move over? Who's this, your girlfriend? You think you scare me with that doodling? YOU move over, I go in. Don't give me that look or I'll fall in love... There's "Ugly"... he'll give us jackets. Evening... "Ugly", we need two jackets. Jackets? What for? Give me yours, "Beanpole"... come on. Come on! Do that to me and I'll fuck you up. --That's why I did it to him... Stop there. --You won't pass, even with those jackets on. Can't you see it's not your size? I swear I'll fuck you up! First we need jackets and now they're not good?? What's the problem? --Problem is you won't get inside. Who says that? Calm down, Cesare... We wanted to get some pills inside... --So what? I'll get 'em for you. The assholes won't let you in... --I'll try... let's go. Give back the jacket. No.. you're with those guys... They let THEM in! You let THEM in, did you?? You don't understand, he's a lunatic! I'll burn this place down! Will you calm down, Cè? Why you said I'm a lunatic? Maybe they'd let us in... Maybe? --I tried... By saying I'm a lunatic? --So, what's the big deal? Cè... cut it out already! There they are waiting. Something good? "Popeye". Any "berries"? "Berries" make us laugh our brains out. No berries... how many of these? Stay calm and nothing happens! Get the cash from the register! I saw you! Get it out! It's inside the panties! Me? These two fags couldn't even grab her panties! Will you get it?? --The cash! There's no cash... She won't give it! --Go get it! --You go get it! He made me nervous, yelling "get the cash! get the cash!" I wouldn't have thought twice and stuck my hand inside there! Like hell! You didn't even get a decent car! Get in! Quick! It doesn't turn on! --What the hell! Get off and push it! Come on! It's not working! We could have pushed all day! Were you afraid she would bite you? --She'd bit us with her pussy! A pussy with teeth. I'm gonna puke! Vittò... thank God you're here, these guys are getting way out of hand. I told you 100 times not to wait for me... are you drunk? --No, just one Campari... Go home! --Who the fuck are these? Where do you think you're going? Are you happy? See what you've done? What did I do? --You got us to fight with them. Go home now. I told you to go home! Change that skirt, you look like a whore. Go! You're always mean to her. Franco! 6 cappuccinos... no, 7! Seven, with foam. Do some work, Franco! Aren't they ready yet? Franco... lend me a 100, I'm broke. Make this effort... I'll give it back. Keep an eye on him. --I'm not going anywhere. What are you leaving? Good night. You gotta eat something... --No! Don't be like that. Cesare! --Hey, ugly! Look what uncle brought you. --What is it, uncle? Aren't the ones you like? --Yes. Now we gonna eat 'em all. Hi, ma'. Here, drink the milk grandma made for you. Not the milk, come on... "Not the milk"? Drink it or I'll get mad! Drink up! I'll steal one of your cookies. What's this money, ma'? I've been to the fishmonger, got a couple of millions... You borrowed cash from that shark? --I don't want the little girl to miss anything. You should have told me! I'd take care of that! When? You're never here. Hi, Vittò... hi, Cè. Don't be so enthusiastic... What do you want? Nothing... I needed to see you. Now you saw me... look how handsome I am... So, what shall we do? --What shall we do? Let's throw some kicks. "Beanpole", get the ball. --Who, me? No, your sister... It gets also chilly... Goddammit! What happened? Got stung! Let me see. --Leave it... Fucking junkies leaving this shit around! They always shoot inside here. You gotta go get yourself tested right away for AIDS! What "right away"? You need months before you see it! He can't wait months! He'll freak out! I don't give a shit! I'll kill 'em all! We can't stay here all day. Let's go inside. If they see us they won't come anyway. We've been here 30 minutes and no one showed up... --If you wanna go, just go. We'll get 'em some other time... --No, I'll get 'em now! Sitting here, waiting for a junkie... Even Viviana said they come here to shoot. --Yes, go ahead and listen to that nutjob... My sister wasn't even a junkie... that asshole gave her AIDS. Can't bare to think about it... She died and left Debora to us. How is she? What do you think? How many you got? --100 for 5000. Are those "playboy"? --A bit of everything. They're not enough, brother. So, Lenzetta... 30 to sell for 50 each. 50... --You sell them for 50! A couple of hours at the park, see how it goes... --You keep walking around, got it? Then a couple of hours at the elephants. Then you bring back the money, got it? Repeat if you understood. I go to the elephants... --You understood shit! First you go to the park, do I write it down for you? No, no... --Then what do you do? Then... --You bring back the money! Money, yes... --Don't forget, be sharp. Sharp... --This is a total idiot, what the hell! You're getting paid for this! All good? Are they all your kids? --Just three, the others are my brothers'. 3 and a half million. It's 35 for 1 gram. I don't think it's enough. That's all we got. Get some more in it, what do we care? We're 200,000 short. Hey Cè... Vittò... Hear what happened to us last night. We bought two pieces from Lenzetta last night. --So? One was good, the other made my nose fizz. --What shit was that, Cè? It's good stuff! --I tell you it was fizzing... Must have been "fizzy cocaine", ever heard of it? You really never heard of "fizzy cocaine"? We go dancing tonight, tell "Shortie" and "Fatty". We'll bring regular coke, we're out of "fizzy". To tell the truth, I like the regular better. --Me too. Although the fizzy one has got something to it... Wait here. See ya, guys. The money you gave my mother, plus two months interests. Hello, ugly. Hi, uncle. I'm so tired... Get some rest. Close those eyes. Medicine's almost finished, we gotta go see the doctor for more. What does he say? Exams are this month's end. It's up to the Lord... He took away her mother... now the daughter... I just couldn't take it. No one is taking her away... you think of the medicines and no one will take her away. It's true... Someone's selling in behalf of a certain "Pen"... or "Chicken"... Very low prices... their boss is a woman. Who the fuck are these "Pen" and "chicken"? Never heard of... Just go. Don't you need help... --Just go! Ok... see ya... What's that? --Had it for long... Wanna keep it yourself? --Get it away from me! Do you know "Chicken" and "Pen"? Nothing? What about you? "Pen"? "Chicken"? Anyone? --Feather is my man... who the fuck are you, a cop? Your man? Go figure... Tell him to cut it out or we'll turn him into a pencil... --And we'll boil the chicken... This area belongs to us, do you understand? Yes. --She says "yes"... I think she understands shit instead... Let's go. She got it, let's go. --Dumb bitch... Give me that gun. Go easy... --He called the cops. Let's split up. Get hold of this. You have the gun? I tossed it. What you mean "tossed"? --It was a toy-gun anyway, right? Toy my ass! It's a loaded 765! --He's my son, Tommasino. Hi, Tommaso. Go get some milk while I talk to this gentleman. Ok, but I'll get cards too. --Alright. I know it's real... I'm not that stupid. Coffee's ready... want some? No, thanks... I have to go... --Just 5 minutes, sit down. What do you do? Nothing, why? You think I'm some bandit? It's not even my gun... a friend gave it to me because of the cops... And you put it in my purse. They don't search you. Is it a drug matter? --What drugs... people are fixated with drugs... What do you do? The mother. I raise Tommasino and sometimes he raises me. In the morning he goes to school and I go clean houses. We have little money, however... We find lots of stuff. Sugar? The whale in front! Mind at your own asses! I should put her on the roof! You're some assholes! Whip it out, come on... Good idea, let's whip it out... I mean the coke, idiot... I wanna snort! --Be good! She's all worked up... Let me see what's down here... Enough! All by yourself?? --What did you pick us up for? Get her some already! --Shut the fuck up! Give me some first... --Now she gonna feel sick... Easy with that! Come on! They're quicker at the post office! Here you go, love! Make a line, don't eat it! Like that... look, it's 3 pounds! Blow it! You damn idiot! Goddammit! Look for it! Go down! Start this car already! Push that pedal, let's go! I need two grams. Got 2 pieces? --We'll take it as well. --Yes, it's already been 30 minutes. Shit, you're really hooked up, aren't you? Chicca! --Hi, Pama! Have you got a shot? --As much as you want, come. See ya. --Bye. Shall we blow or what? --Come on. Can we have that one too? --Come on, Vittò... please... Look, I'll let you fuck me... --Yes, we'll fuck... What the fuck! Where the fuck is it?? Look over there. --It's under here... What are you looking at, rocks? Have you checked there? --It fell right here! Get the fuck out of here! Not the pepper spray! --Come on, get up! Get the fuck away from me! Asshole! --What have we ever done to you?? You left your purse, you dumb bitch! Is it enough for the way back home? --Are we going home? Where else? Anywhere. Where? Where... Drop this. Why have we stopped? There's... There's the bus... it's full of people, I could run 'em over... There's nothing, Vittò... Are you shitting me? Look how many people! There's nothing out there, Vittò... it's the pills... There's nothing? --Nothing... I'll drive... Drive slow... watch out for people... We'll go slowly, don't worry... we won't hurt anyone... Are they there or not? Well, they may be there but we'll drive carefully.... Is there nothing up as well? What do you see up there? UFOs? Let's go. Vivia! He took one too many... he sees UFOs... Why UFOs? No... they're just fantasies... You shit! --Idiot! --Asshole! What the fuck you think you're doing, leaving us alone with no car? Why you sprayed us? Are you fucking nuts? He's not well... --Oh, he's not well, poor baby.... The hell I care! That'll teach you to sniff it all yourself! You eat alone, you choke! We'll cook some good bucatini so Vittorio will be right better. Who the fuck can cook those? I can't. --Me neither. Can't you do that? Of course, you can only do blowjobs. Yes, your mother taught me that. Even a blind man can see you're two whores. Fuck off! --Don't touch me! You need to shut up! Me and Vittorio gotta concentrate on this fucking pasta! Shut up! Shut up! I'll hit you with this pan! Mute! You need help, Cè? --No, go have a seat. So... Jowl? --Jowl my ass, Vittò... What the fuck was that?? The devil was inside the pan, Cesare! I saw it... it was red with horns... --What's he talking about? See the horns? He's cooked... --Don't touch me! Will you let me cook this pasta or what? I had to hear it from others, after 8 years... It's not fair... Get in. I'd understand if she was super-hot, but a piece of garbage like that.... Do you know her? I can't even remember her name. Linda... her name is Linda. Vittorio also told me he wants to get a job. --See? It's not normal... I heard she also has a son. Shut your mouth, Vivia. Don't shit your panties... Like they scare me... If you don't hurry they'll end up drinking this. --Be faithful, honey. WE are gonna drink it. You seem like a Martian to me... You too... We're two Martians. --I wish... that'd be good... Only we picked the wrong planet. Let's just go... we're out of fuel. There he is. Working man! You're all dirty from work, look... --So what? We wondered if she beats you up to get you to work. Of course she does. --Don't you have anything else to do? Take this... --I'm not interested. He said he's not interested... let's just go. I'm staying, see you later. Aren't you tired yet? Isn't enough? How long you think you can last? Find a woman and settle down. --Come, Vittò... I gotta tell you something. I ended up fucking Viviana... it wasn't me, she was the one who... I don't give a shit, I'm with Linda now. You could have told me. Told you what? That she's so good at it... How's this Linda? How's like? Beat it, Cè. --She likes you? How's she when... --I told you to beat it! Aren't you gonna tell me how she is... --I told you to cut it out! It's you who sneaked out, piece of shit! You left for you own fucking business! Don't you think of me? How am I gonna work? --What fucking work? You're completely stoned. Pull yourself together. Give me the fucking pills. I told you to give me the fucking pills! Give 'em... --Why? --I'll throw 'em, what you think? Give 'em to me. --What you mean "throw"? Fucking throw... stop it, I'll give 'em to you alright! What you gonna do? --Flush 'em in the toilet. What fucking toilet... --Get lost now, I'll pick you up tomorrow at 6. At 6? To go where? To the yard. The construction yard? Are you taking me with you? --Yes, I'm taking you with me. 6 o'clock. Just what you needed... I'm all he's got. Who'll help him if I don't? I only know he's a lunatic and you are wrong to take him with you. I can't ditch him. You're new in that yard... It's already a miracle if they keep you with all those Polish workers. Who's this Cesare? A friend... Like a brother... we've known since ever. What are you writing? It's homework, I gotta write what happens at home. Teacher's interested in our business... May I? "Vittorio, who sleeps with me mother"... it's "my mother"... "...says he wanna bring Cesare to work, a dear friend from childhood." Nice work, Tommaso... put it down right. Where are you going this early? --To the yard. Yard? It's Vittorio's idea. Bye, ma'. --Bye. We try here first... if it goes wrong we'll try another one... there's plenty of sites. Look who's there! Lenza, who's in charge here? Mario is the boss, but today we are full already. Where's this Mario? Mario! Mario! Who's Mario? It's me, what's up? We're here to work... what shall we do? We're at full capacity today. Can you come down a moment to talk? --We're full! We told you to come down, come on! Relax... this is how you get a job. Are you deaf? I don't need you, try somewhere else... Come here, Mario... I'll tell you something... If we aren't working, nobody will be working here today. What can you do? We're refined builders. --What refined... We are refined! --Are you or not? --Lenza, tell him we're refined builders! Don't you know I'm a refined builder? --Dunno... Alright, show me what you can do. --Thanks. Cut it out with that water! You should thank me, you haven't washed since last summer. That's not the way you do it! --Easy... Look what you've done, you better go back to your old job... Be good or I'll get you fired. --On top of it... C'mon... pull... Pull... Watch out! God! Sorry! I slipped! Give us the money, Mario! You did nothing but damage! We worked and we want the cash! --You did shit! Hand the money! --Calm down! What's this fuss? --They want their hard-earned money! Here's another idiot! Hey, asshole! --Rat! 50 each and you disappear! --Make it 100. For you... for you... And never show up 'round here again. Never again? Now that we have each other's trust? I got a deal for you... Some friends got a truck loaded with those new TVs... big as cinema screens... What deal? They cost millions... Yes, if you buy 'em in the shop... You'll get 'em for a few bucks, I just need a small deposit... What brand? --Sony, Philips... all worth 2 millions... You'll have 'em for 500K, but I need 200K in advance. Let me just think about it. While you think, somebody else will get 'em, let's go. Alright, wait... I can give you 100K. 200K, Mario... it's a favor I'm doing because you been kind to us. Ok then... I knew you were smart... do you need 'em too? I got no cash on me. --Mario can vouch for you. You want one? --I'll pay you later. Great, Mario! What's this TV shit? --It's a deal. You can't fuck who makes you work --Vittò.... Life is tough and you gotta be tougher. Here's for you. Insane! A work-epidemic! I like to work, so what? --Now that you're in that field... Can you provide a blowtorch? He needs a blowtorch! --What for, Ugly? To open up a safe. --Yes, of course... let's go. Franco, two beers! What you're looking at? He's shocked that we are working... We earn our bread, unlike those four out there. I like it and I grabbed it, so what? How many you screwed with the TV scam? Can't remember... a lot. How much did you make? 2 or 3 millions. We need those money... All the problems... Debora's sickness... Why give half to me then? --Cause you have a family too. Here. --Why? You need 'em more than I do. Ugly? I got something for you and you don't come greet me? What, ma'? --She got worse... High fever all afternoon, the doctor came by... She'll be hospitalized in two days. Two days? --Soon as a bed becomes available. You'll have to look after yourself, I'll have a bed arranged for me in her room. What are you, sleeping? You know what just happened to me? I met this guy on the street, he was crying his eyes out... I said: "What happened to you?" He said: "I've been looking for an ugly girl for years! I just love ugly girls!" I said: "I know the ugliest girl of all! Just come home with me!" I brought him home... Will you meet him? Yes? He's kinda shy... Here. Will you sleep with me? He'll get offended... he came all the way here... Don't get her upset, Cè... Ok, we'll have to squeeze a bit. I can't leave her alone... you'll have to do by yourself. Of course, ma'. How many machines you said you need? Make it 5. You got enough room? I'll find the room... --Save room for the beers... Drinking relaxes them. I'll bring 5 machines and our part is 50%, ok? Vittorio is a precise guy. Ok. This kid is some painter. I don't like this video-poker thing one bit. --Look at me... It's to raise money fast, then we'll just close up. Yes, yes... What do I do? Nothing, just keep your eyes shut. --Shall I wait here? Come on, Cè... Give me the hand... get off... Let me close the door. --It's cold! Where the fuck did you take me? --Eyes closed, don't cheat! Walk on. --Hold me! Here? When do we get there? Keep 'em closed. Are we there? Stop right there. Will you tell me where we are? We're home, Vivia. I brought you to our house. Come... wait... Living room! We'll put a big table here! We'll have some parties here! --Yes... How do you want it? We'll make it as you want! How do you like it? --It's beautiful! You like it? We'll be great here. We're not on the street here, hold this. Where are you going? We gotta celebrate! Hold the glasses! A nice toast to this slum! See that hole? We won't fix that... It's thrilling going to the bathroom and a brick might fall on your head! You like thrill, don't you? Sit here. How did you find this? I made a wish. This is perfect for two... even for three... Three? Don't you want a baby? Don't you want it? --Me and you? Who else? A baby girl... more than one... we'll call her Viviana! Like me? --We'll call 'em all Viviana! I want a house filled with Vivianas! "Viviana, dinner's ready!" "Viviana, where are you?" Let me look at you. I wanna look at you forever. Forever? --Forever. It's a robbery! Give me all you got! It's nothing... keep on playing... I need money for my wedding! Should we pay for that?? Keep on playing... --Fuck off! Stay calm! Sit down! Take him to the circus this friend of yours! --Alright, let's go! What the fuck you think you're doing? I have to get married... --What the fuck do I care?? You're right... You're right but it's not my fault... --Whose fault might that be? What have you taken? Tell me what the fuck did you take! --I took nothing... In fact, have you got a pill? Just one... --Just one? You want one? Happy? Then what? --What are you crazy? What the fuck do you want? --I'll hurt you... --Go ahead! Quiet, you'll wake 'em up. Mom's at the hospital with Debora. She died in the darkness, Cè... At night... She shouldn't have died by night... it's all dark... Wasn't even midnight... Two minutes before midnight... What are we gonna do without her... The funeral is... We have to organize... talk to the priest... I'll take care of that... You won't have to do anything... right, Cè? We'll take care of everything. Tomma? Tommasino? Quiet, you'll wake him up. What the fuck... --I'm also good at this, see? What the fuck did you do?? You swore you'd never do it again! I fucked up this once... --Yes you did! I can fuck up too! If you start back, I'll do it too! You mustn't do it! --I don't believe you anymore, Vittò... I don't believe shit anymore! It's that fucking bar, isn't? Forget everything... I'll return to work in construction sites... For how long? How long before you start it all back? Ma'... What's going on? Tomma... Stop here! What a dump... --Don't you like it? As long as you like it... morning, ma'am! We like it a lot, right? --Hell yeah! We're not paying any rent, you know? --Don't tell me... Unload this thing! What's this? The money you advanced for the TVs. --That scum... There's no TVs left. No left, huh? You think you can fix it like this? Let me work, Mario... We're full. --I need it... I don't need YOU. Let's do this... The first day you don't pay me, see how I work... Please... No pay? Let me try. Always this mess... Hi. Hi. How it went? Don't you see? They took you back... Can they ever let one like me go? A little practice today... tomorrow I'll start back. He isn't done with this yet? He's got all double cards... --He won't give up. Neither do I. I wanna learn good this time. Tired? Happy. It shows. I am too. Hey... -What? --Are you crying? I always do when I'm happy. I wonder how much will it last... You'll see it will last... Just enjoy this. Cheers. --Cheers. Let's baptize the house. Mine didn't break... --It's just superstition! Ok, but let's break it anyway... I'll destroy it! You're such a pain in the ass! Look what the cat dragged in.... --I need money, got something for me? Depends... on how much of a bonehead you've gotten between Viviana and that asshole Vittorio. I have no time to lose, have you got business or what? I might have something... --Let's hear it. I need two armed men for a delivery, from Rome to Ostia. What's the deliver? --Heroin. What's our share? --50 grams each. Let's do it. Keep it until I come back, I'll only bring along a sample. Ever been on such a boat? Wouldn't you like it? Get away from all this shit... To go where? Where... Don't look at it... you'll get bad thoughts. What's happening? What the fuck have you done? --Nothing... it's all fine... It's all right... Did you huff that much cocaine? That's not cocaine... The stuff is heroin... What have you gone insane?? I had to test it... It's work... I gotta sell it... Don't you dare try this again! Promise me... Promise me! --I'm not that stupid... Vivia... I'm not that crazy... Let's go to sleep. Apartments are definitely better than the yard, you stay indoors. Mario always has a couple of these to fix, plenty of work. Mario is not one to hold a grudge, huh? Did he ever ask about the TVs? He's no idiot... if I hadn't repaid him we wouldn't be working now. You gave him back the money? He still doesn't know it was a scam... Really? Let's get the money back then, we'll split it. You think he'll agree? --Yes, yes... You'll see he's fine with it. Here he is... hi, Cè. What is this a fashion show? You better look for someone less funny... you can't laugh all day long like this. Samantha's here for that thing... --Viviana told me you have 50 grams of shit. She says she can place it. But it's gotta be good stuff, not baking soda. Soda? I'll make you try some soda. Ever huffed something like this? This stuff is hot... almost like me... Then leave the money and go fuck yourself. What a venal man you have here, Vivia. Samantha says you'll get the money after each sale. What am I an idiot? No way I'll do it like that. Cesare, please... don't say no... I don't want this shit inside the house... --Then let's see the money! Be reasonable! I don't trust these fucking junkies! --What do you think you are instead? Go... out of my house you fucking faggot! Out! Vivia? Where's the stuff? You left it on the table. --Where is it now? I gave it to Samantha, she'll sell it and give you the cash. What the fuck were you thinking?? She'll just sniff it all and goodbye money! Do you know Samantha? You know where Samantha lives? Long, black hair... Yes, the green house over there. Open the fucking door! Open the fucking door, faggot! I want my money! You'll get it when I have it... --Open the fucking door! There's people trying to rest around here. Mind you fucking business! She won't open... --It's our business! Shit, you're horny! Open the door! Open the fucking door! What's going on here? That nuts is trying to knock down the door. Nothing's happening... Just take him away! --What the fuck do you want? Finally! Thank God you're here. What's going on? It's him, officer... he's been bothering me for days. I'm bothering you... Ever since he had the first taste he's been after me day and night... I think he's in love. You owe me 5 millions! You're dreaming! Admit it... you're in love... Faggot! Faggot! Leave me alone! Listen up... She had me go down for a faggot! She swore she'll give you the money... --You shut up! You had no right to give it to her! I did it for you! I don't want you to do that shit! Do you hear me? --Fuck you... I'm trying my best, Vittò... I care for him... We all care for that nutjob. Stop here. Dig. --Why? --Dig! Dig your own grave. --Are you insane? Are you for real? Gimme that! This way! This is the way you do it! What's going on? --Go back to bed, Vivia... you keep digging. Dig! I want my stuff or you end up inside there. That's insane, don't you realize it? Vivia, talk to him! Have you gone insane? What are you doing? --Shut up, don't interfere. Keep digging. Go home, Viva. Dig. Viviana! Viviana! Viviana? What's happened to you, Cè? You look like Christ on the cross... Have you seen that faggot Samantha? I wanna kill him! Forget about that, we have a nice job to do. --An apartment in Parioli, luxury stuff... We even got the keys... a friend of mine makes double keys... Tell it to Ugly. He's not interested... that son of a bitch is doing his own business... Do it by yourself. I'll kill you right here, give me all you got. --Yes, stay calm... Just don't hurt me... I said everything! Yes, here it is... Relax, I won't hurt you. Cesare? What have you done?? --Help me... Help me... --What happened? Stay here... It's too much blood! We gotta go to the hospital! We gotta go, please Cesare! Stay still. Hold still... Look, it's 5 millions... Samantha brought it today... See? I told you to trust her... Can't you see he's wounded? Take him to the hospital! A YEAR LATER I'd like to know what you were gonna eat. Hey, kid! --You're lucky mom remembered... I also brought a beer. Thanks, put it over there. What are you working at? Take off the jacket and give me a hand, will you? Here... mix this cement. Look... this way... Tell mom about today. They hired me at the yard. Yea... with a proper contract too I presume... It's the truth. He's gonna be much better than me. You mean it's not a joke? Aren't you happy? These days it's a stroke of luck. She fell for it... Another laborer in the house... It's "builder"... I lay down pavings. Money is still very few anyway. Mom's right, Vittò... you do a nice work but the pay is truly low. I'm underpaid, get it? I think I'm gonna help Pina at the laundry, she needs someone. What about the job at the cooperative? I can do both, three afternoons a week. A little more cash to bring home. What are we short of? It depends... are you happy with what we've got? Bye. You have a second? What's to discuss between me and you? Vittò... what did you tell your son? Can I say "your son"? --What do you want from Tommaso? He asked me for a job. --What? He offered to deliver envelopes, he said you need money back home. What did you tell him? --I'm no piece of shit... I won't give any jobs to your son, I won't get him involved. I count on that. Vittò... If you need a bit of cash for your family... I'm here. Just for a while, to be back on your feet. I pulled out of that. You made a mistake... the kid is not wrong... You can't keep him on a short chain, you need some money. You know how it is 'round here, you can't go on without any goods. Many live out of that. I better go. Think about it... good money at month's end instead of kicks in the ass. Bye, Ugly. Let me help you. Vittò... How long has been... Do you live here now? It was his mom's idea... when he was born, she wanted us to move here. I had no idea... He's beautiful. Hey, Cesare! Here he is! Will you make a nice smile for Vittorio? You know, this man and your father were like brothers... ENGLISH SUBTITLES BY BARISHNIKOV@KICKASS
