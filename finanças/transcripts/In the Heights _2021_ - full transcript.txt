What does sueñito mean? Sueñito? It means "little dream." That's it? No story? Can we go in the water now? Let him explain. All right, all right. Everybody sit down, sit down. - Yes! Yeah! - All right. All right. Bueno. It's the story of a block that was disappearing. Once upon a time, in a far away land called Nueva York... ...en un barrio called Washington Heights. Say it, so it doesn't disappear. Washington Heights! All right, all right. Oye, oye, oye. The streets were made of music. Ooh! ¡Mi gente! It's your boy, The Kid Mero. It's 5:30 AM, and here's today's news. In a record-breaking heat wave, the mayor's urging residents to what? Limit air conditioner use, as brownouts continue in the Bronx. Check it out, this weekend's highly anticipated block party, Fiesta in the Heights, is about to get you out of your homes and into the clubs. Hey, Pop. Best days of my life.

Let's just keep those boxes in order, too. Ah, the hustle never ends. - Alejandro, how you doing? - ¿Qué lo qué? - How's the law office? - Ah, still going, thank God. - You're spitting image of your old man. - Oh, man, come on. Yeah, so how was the DR? I got to visit some old friends. You know how it is. I wish I could go back more often. That's facts. Hey, so you get to check out my dad's old place? Mm. Same story as last time? You ready? Oye, no me relajes. Don't play! Now, it's probably not how you remember it, but it could be an opportunity to bring it back to life. Ah, diablo. My pops would be rolling in his grave if he saw what came of his bar. The electricity's shot. Half the roof got taken in the hurricane. Thus the low asking price, the quick sale. "El Sueñito." Pop's little dream. Yo, I remember, man, when... I used to be working in the back on a soda gun. And I was like John Wick. I'd be like... ¡Fuácata, fuácata, fuácata, fuácata! I've been saving up all my pennies in my piggy bank for this day. Yeah, on these blocks, you can't walk two steps without bumping into someone's big plans. Mijo... Okay, I'm in. Thank you, man. I'll see you, papa. - Nos vemos. - Come on. Here we go. This is crazy! Let's go! Mine was a... quaint little sueñito. If I made it back to the Dominican Republic, then we retained our roots. But Nina Rosario's dreams were all about reach. Spelling bee champ, valedictorian, managed her dad's business and basically... she was like a little sister to me. Girl was a rocket, determined to go far. What?! The genius is back! - I missed you! - Me, too. Did you just get in? Yeah, late last night. MOVING NEW LOCATION: 3843 GRAND CONCOURSE BRONX, NY 10468 - In a week? - Yeah, it's really happening. Yo, so much to catch up on. - Come over for a free mani-pedi, yeah? - I need it. Mm-hm.

Yo, mad changes happening on the block since you've been at school. Oh, yeah. I mean, at least your dad kept half the storefront. Yo, the cleaners next door, nine dollars a shirt. - What? - Yo! Look who's home! Look at you! Why are you taller than me? I know, my man grew a couple inches, he think he a man. - Man, shut up. - I see you. Listen, you down to march next week? Like we used to? What's the cause? They're talking about kicking out all the Dreamers. It's time to make some noise. You want to come? I know that voice! Whoo-hoo! ¡Ven p'acá! - Count me in. - Yo. Later. - Well, you do good? You done? - Yeah. - My man, who's watching the store? - What? - Yo! - Shit! Pete! You can't just take that! Bro! Get back here, man! That's on your tab, bro! Both of y'all. Oh, yes. Hand-embroidered by your mother. May she rest in peace. We'll use them for the party. They're beautiful. Abuela Claudia never had kids, so she adopted the whole block as her own. Adopted our sueñitos, too. When I got to Stanford... ...the isolation, Abuela. The loneliness. I was, like, "What am I doing here?" Ay, mija, yo sé. Mira, when my mamá came from Cuba... Ay, Dios mío. She felt like one tiny grain of sand from the beaches we left behind. What did she do? She bought a winter coat and a pair of velvet gloves. Her hands were cracked from the cleaning fluids. But the gloves hid that. We had to assert our dignity in small ways. That's why these napkins are beautiful. That's why my mother's gloves were beautiful. Little details that tell the world we are not invisible. ♪ Sigue andando ♪ ♪ el camino por toda su vida ♪ ♪ Respira ♪ ♪ - Breathe ♪ ♪ - Y si pierdes mis huellas ♪ ♪ Que Dios te bendiga ♪ ♪ Respira ♪ ♪ This is my street ♪ ♪ I smile at the faces ♪ ♪ - I've known all my life ♪ ♪ - Hey, Nina. ¿Cómo estás? ♪ ♪ They regard me with pride ♪ ♪ And everyone's sweet ♪ ♪ They say, "You're going places" ♪ ♪ So how can I say that ♪ ♪ while I was away ♪ ♪ - I had so much to hide? ♪ ♪ - Hey, Nina! ♪ ♪ Hey, guys, it's me ♪ ♪ The biggest disappointment you know ♪ ♪ The kid couldn't hack it ♪ ♪ She's back and ♪ ♪ she's walkin' real slow ♪ ♪ - Welcome home ♪ ♪ - Just breathe ♪ ♪ Sigue andando ♪ ♪ el camino por toda su vida ♪ ♪ Respira ♪ ♪ - Just breathe ♪ ♪ - Y si pierdes mis huellas ♪ ♪ Que Dios te bendiga ♪ ♪ - Respira ♪ ♪ - As the radio plays ♪ ♪ Old forgotten boleros ♪ ♪ I think of the days ♪ ♪ When this city was mine ♪ ♪ I remember the praise ♪ ♪ - "Ay, te adoro, te quiero" ♪ ♪ - Te adoro ♪ ♪ The neighborhood waved and said ♪ ♪ "Nina, be brave and ♪ ♪ You're gonna be fine" ♪ ♪ And maybe it's me ♪ ♪ - But it all seems like lifetimes ago ♪ ♪ - Respira ♪ ♪ So what do I say to these faces ♪ ♪ That I used to know? ♪ ♪ "Hey, I'm home?" ♪ ♪ Mira, Nina ♪ ♪ - Hey... ♪ ♪ - No me preocupo por ella ♪ ♪ They're not worried about me ♪ ♪ Mira, allí está nuestra estrella ♪ ♪ They are all counting on me to succeed ♪ ♪ Ella sí da la talla ♪ ♪ I am the one who made it out! ♪ ♪ The one who always made the grade ♪ ♪ But maybe I should have ♪ ♪ Just stayed home ♪ ♪ When I was a child ♪ ♪ I stayed wide awake ♪ ♪ Climbed to the highest place ♪ ♪ On every fire escape ♪ ♪ - Restless to climb ♪ ♪ - Respira ♪ ♪ I got every scholarship ♪ ♪ Saved every dollar ♪ ♪ The first to go to college ♪ ♪ - How do I tell them why ♪ ♪ - Respira ♪ ♪ I'm coming back home? ♪ ♪ With my eyes on the horizon ♪ ♪ Just me and GWB ♪ ♪ Asking, "Gee, Nina ♪ ♪ What will you be?" ♪ ♪ Straighten the spine ♪ ♪ Smile for the neighbors ♪ ♪ Everything's fine ♪ ♪ Everything's cool ♪ ♪ The standard reply ♪ ♪ Lots of tests, lots of papers ♪ ♪ Smile, wave goodbye ♪ ♪ And pray to the sky, oh, God ♪ ♪ - And how do I dare to say? ♪ ♪ - Nina ♪ ♪ - Can I go in there and say ♪ ♪ - Nina ♪ ♪ I know that I'm letting you down ♪ Nina! ♪ Just... ♪ ♪ Breathe ♪ The reality of an elite school... it's no joke, Pop. Mm. Yeah, when I left, y'all were, like, "It's gonna be great. Go show 'em who we are. Go represent." The truth is... ...is that most of the time I'm at Stanford feels like a betrayal. ¿De verdad? Of who? Of my family. My community. Like the dean, he invited me to this diversity dinner. Super-wealthy donors, trustees, the whole nine. And I wore this black cocktail dress and I was walking to my seat, and one of the patrons shoved her plate into my arms and said, "I ordered the vegetarian option." - No. - Yeah. And all the servers, all Latino, shot me this look, like, "Ooh, what's this trigueña gonna do?" "Ooh, what's she gon' do? Is she with us? Or is she with them?" Ah, bueno. There's no shame in waiting tables. And there's no shame in having a different path. Hm? Like you. Dad... the deadline passed. The extension on spring tuition. ¿De verdad? - Yeah. - But I didn't receive notice. Yeah, they let me finish off my classes, but we owe them. No, don't you give it a second thought. I'm on it. Mm? Dad... The deadline to pay and enroll for next semester also passed. How come you know about all this before I do? I switched the info. I gave the finance office my dorm address. Well, why would you do that? Because you sold half the business, and it barely covered freshman year. I don't want you doing something else crazy. - Espera, that sale pulled us out of debt. - No, no. You and I both know that finances were tenuous before getting into this. And this might not be feasible. - I'm gonna call them right now. - Dad, Stanford's over. Stop overreacting, Nina. - Please. - Dad, I'm serious. ¡Oye! You don't tell me how much we can afford. You're not the parent. Mm? God bless you. Dios te bendiga. ¡Gracias! ¿Qué es esto? What's all over those pipes? - Rust. - Rust? Lovely. - ¿Y esto? - That's the roof. On the floor? Ay, Usnavi. Tú eres un workaholic. You think it will be different in the Dominican Republic? Just like my mamá. Morning and night, year after year... to what end? To wake up and scrub another floor till the day she died. Yeah, but... here I work to survive. El Sueñito will be a labor of love. The bodega was only supposed to be temporary, but now... I'm like, almost 30. The plan was always to go back. Hopefully, I won't be going alone. You, me and Sonny? ¿Y Sonny? Is he on board? He's my next ask. I'm not going without him. Look, I got Sonny. You know I can't go nowhere without you. I took care of my community, no? Hell, yes! El Sueñito 2.0. The tropical air'll keep you young, girl! Caramba, buy me a bikini! Let's go! I don't know, man. Leave Washington Heights? I'd have to talk to my dad... You're just a kid. You don't even know. For real. Dominican Republic's gonna blow your mind. Look... You do you. It's all good. But don't be roping me into your thing. Yo... Beach. Merengue. Carnaval. Summer all year 'round. Who's gonna greet you in DR? Some cousin you saw two Christmases ago? Best days of my life were there. That's the corniest thing I've ever heard. You came here when you was eight. You got... "island memories." Not me. I was in Pampers on that plane. NYC's my spot. I got my island, okay? Go get yours. Don't forget how you got your name. - Yo... - Just, fix the fridge. Yeah, all right. Bro, you think you're funny? What's "Usnavi" mean, anyway? That sounds weird. No, it doesn't. - Shut up. - All right. All right, all right, all right. On my dad's first trip to Nueva York... ...he saw a passing ship on the horizon. And... he was, like, "Wow, that's gonna be my son's name." Usnavi! Ohh! Usnavi... I like it. Thank you. - Hi, Mr. Rosario? - Yes, yes, I'm here. Yes, I'm not sure the information you received was correct. In actuality, we're still accepting tuition payments up until June. So the deadline hasn't passed? No, it has not passed. Would you like to know the remaining balance? Uh, yes. I have a pencil. Sure, the balance that's due for the fall semester... Daniela's Lenguaje de là belieza SALON 2 DAYS 'TIL BLACKOUT 88ᴼ☼ Now, remember, the block was disappearing. ExhibitA: Daniela's salon. Moving in a week, after decades of makeovers... the skin-deep kind and the emotional kind. No one could fill her shoes. Literally, they were like four inches high. He doesn't have an apartment. He doesn't pay rent anywhere. He's bouncing between two girls' houses. - Of course he is. - Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. You know what? It's mad we allow ourselves to be hurt. - We need to have a better standard. - That's what I'm saying. Tres paradas... - ...and you're at the new spot. - Mira, ¿qué parte es la que no entiendes? I'm too old, and the Bronx is too far. ¿Qué voy a hacer? I was priced out. Y yo no soy la única. Most of my clients already up and moved to the Grand Concourse. Hey, built in customers. My lunch break isn't long enough for that trip, Dani. Jessica... One: swipe the fare card. Two: ride three stops. Three: arrive at my new location. Ten minutes max. Ten minutes? Cariño.

Hey, Boss, I got your caffeine. I'm in a meeting. Oh, hey, Pike. Everything okay? Thank you, Benny. Thank you very much. - Need anything else? - No, no. We're good, thank you very much. If you need... - Good kid. - Yes. Café con leche. Number twelve... It's better than his current school. I can pay for his flights, to and from. Christmas, summers... Just so that he doesn't go too long without seeing you. And, you know, I know you're his dad, and I'm just his big cousin, but... I mean... this could be good for him. You're unsure. Talk to me. Chill out. You're hovering. You're doing that thing, you should... That's your first of the day? Listen, if I could be like... "Out you go, Sonny," I would. I thought about it. But, I can't. The kid doesn't listen to shit I say, anyway. - So is that a yes? - Is it a yes? Tío... Come on, man. He's a good kid. He's smart. He's funny. He cares. That kid does well in school, he works hard. And I could tell you. I'm with him every day. Working in my store. I got that kid working to the bone, but look, I'm... He has an opportunity to have a life that you and me didn't have. Come on, Tío. How do you pay him? Cash. Ever wonder why? Ever? - Perdón, Alejandro. - Hey. Thank you for letting me come in last minute. I was just wondering about the status of the deposit. Oh! We got good news, mijo. The check is cashed. Es tuyo. So there's no chance, like, if I wanted to hold off just to tie up some loose ends before... before I go. ¿Tú no me oíste? The place is yours, mijo. Yeah, well... You got cold feet? No... No. No, man. I mean, that's amazing. That's amazing. Thank you again. You know, just, life throws you curve balls, but... I'll figure it out. Thank you again. Felicitaciones, mijo. - A dream come true, right? - Of course. So... Sonny's dad is okay with him leaving? Yeah... he's fine with it. That's great. Pero you wore your papi's hat? Yeah. It fits. ¡Ay, qué guapo! ¡Oh, qué lindo! Oye, llévame ese pan y esas galleticas a la mesa. - Okay, okay. - Okay? Gracias, mi amor. - Abuela. - Mira lo que hice. Hey. I want to talk to you. Not now, but... you know. Oh, yeah. Okay. It's open! Oh, we're in trouble now. - How cute! - Oh, my God, I love that dress. I love your dress. Yo, look at this. Good luck. You're gonna need it. Hey. Hey. What? I'm sorry, you just... You look amazing. - Thanks. - My favorite color. Well, I... have a date tonight, so... Word. Right. That's right.

Oh, yeah, you're trying to be vegan, right? Let me give you a vegan pastel. Nina! You got sauce on my sleeve! Tsk! Pass me a tissue or something. No, I got you. - You're good. - Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Mírenlo. - Now you know. - Be generous. - Yeah, we're gonna get it out. - Wow. - You know what I'm sayin'. Nice. I take note. You know, my first business, I was, like, seven or eight. You know what? Every time you tell the story, you're a different age, and you get younger - and younger and younger. - I was seven or eight... I took a rag and a coffee can, I went to the plaza in Arecibo to shine shoes for a nickel. But every nickel went to shoe polish, right? Because the next time I could charge a dime. - Wow, my man was a hustler. - 'Cause you got that investment brain. - Hey, Benny! - Hey, yo! - The party's just starting, siéntate. - Sorry I'm late. - Let me make you a plate. - No, no, I'm not hungry. Benny, not hungry? Pero come. Hay tanta comida. Yo, Kevin, that meeting I walked in on with you and Pike Phillips... Is that what I thought it was? 'Cause, you know, I keep playing it on loop, and... Adiós. I was saving that news for dessert. What news? You know, when Pike originally approached me, he wanted the whole space. So today, I reopened the conversation. Felicidades, papi. - What? - I knew it. I guess we're gonna do this now, huh? Nina... it was about your age that your mother and I, God rest her soul, we came here and we emptied our savings to put a down payment on Rosario's. Two burgundy Cadillacs, that was your fleet! Mm. Start small, dream big. Mm. I look at you, mija, I see her. Y te lo juro, if she were here, she would've done the same thing that I did today. Dad... I sold Rosario's. - ¡Felicidades! - What? - Raise a glass. - ¡Felicidades! Yes, get that schmoney! To Nina, hm? Who can now finish what she started at Stanford. To Nina! - To Nina. - To Nina. Nina, say, "Thank you, Papi." Dad... the deadline passed. - I don't know what you're talking about. - ¡Mentira, mentira! Stop with the lying, huh? I called them. I called them! Stop trying to protect me here. There were other things other than the finances. Did you not hear what I said? Yes, about the ignorant idiotas... That's the same thing that we foresaw when we came! No, it's not the same thing, Dad. It is not the same. When you came here and Mom came here, you all had a Latino community ready to welcome you, open arms, babies and abuelas, and teachers and lawyers, first generation, fifth generation... There's no community for me at school. I got searched. Yeah. I got searched. On moving day... my roommate lost her pearl necklace and... the RA and her parents came in... and searched me and they... emptied my drawers, turned over my purse... and I just stood there. I stood there and didn't say anything. And then eventually, they found it... in her bag. You're the best we've got, Nina. If you can't stay in the ring, what's that gonna say about us? You can't keep putting your life's work on my shoulders, Dad. Dile, mi gente, isn't she the best we got? And then I apologize like an idiot. I stood there, I didn't do anything, and then I apologized. Well, you keep getting A's, baby, that's your revenge. - My God, you're not hearing her, Kevin. - I'm not going back! - ¿Cómo? - I'm not going back! So all of my decisions can just go to hell here? - I'm doing this for you! - No, you're doing it for you! What if I refuse your money? What if I don't want it? Mírame en los ojos. I refuse.

No, Daddy, keep going. Hey, Pop. Best days of my life. It's creepy quiet. Usually, the One Train's up there, screeching. Yo, I was thinking... there's so much stuff going on. And all it just got me thinking about is, like... all the people I care about the most. And I just thought about you. You're about to change zip codes. Country codes, actually. Yeah, but that's not till August. I mean, you know, we got time. Usnavi... I'm the girl who paints nails. There's plenty like me, here and over there. Stop! Yo, you're an artist. Yo, your senior year lab book... I should've been paying attention to the board, but... ...all them doodles you made. Yo, it was like... Wonder Woman meets... The Simpsons meets... ...Guernica. And I would... I would watch, like... I just want to see the whole world through her eyes. Mira para allá. Benny, you know, before I bought Rosario's... ...it was O'Hanrahan's. The whole block was Irish. You know why I bought it? My dad, he pulled me out of high school, so that I could work on the same farm as him. Making the same pennies. I thought to myself, "No, no, no, papi." "That don't make no sense." I'm gonna drop out so somebody else could get rich off of my work? I came here. So I could make my own damn work. But, you never finished high school? But Nina did. You asked me, "What a sueñito means?" I'm not gonna sit here and give you some fairy tale version. You know, a dream isn't some sparkly diamond we get. You know, sometimes, it's... it's rough. And it's not so pretty. Yeah! ¡Vivan los inmigrantes! DACA was not a gift from some benevolent saint, right? - No. - No! - You made it happen, you fought for it. - Yes! And that's why it still continues now. 'Cause what about the people who don't qualify, like my niece, right? She gets into college without papers, but... no work-study for her. No federal aid for her. So she doesn't get to go to college. It's not right. What did she say? She said her niece couldn't go to college. We can dream bigger and better, right? Yo, Sonny! What's going on? Let's do this. Yes! I knew I couldn't get a license. But no college? She was talking about undocumented folks. I remember when I was your age, they used to say... "If you work hard and you live by the rules, the money will come, the things will come. And that, those things will complete you." But, they won't. We work so hard to try and get there, that we forget about what's right here. I was gonna be like you. Share your stories! Share your stories. There's nothing to be ashamed of! Tell our stories! Tell our stories! Tell our stories! Tell our stories! Tell our stories! Dad, I know what I have to do. You've given me this amazing education and I just need to use it, and figure out how every undocumented kid gets a pathway. Maybe Stanford isn't a way out. Maybe it's a way back. Like Abuela always used to say... asserting our dignity in small ways. Wow. This is it, huh, mija? What? This is the moment when you do better than me. Not because of some fancy degree... It's 'cause you can see a future that I can't. Hey... You are Boricua. Hmm? We're a people on the move, so yeah... ...bring us with you. Ignore anyone who doubts you. You take all the bruises, baby, but you stay in the ring. I called, and it's still available. But Vanessa needs a co-signer, and not one who's about to leave the country. Would you? As a personal favor? We're all ready, ma'am. That's señorita to you. Yes. Yes, ma'am... señorita. Yes. Listas. We'll follow behind. - It's hotter in here. - Put on the AC. ¡Adiós, mi gente! Come find me in the Bronx. 3843 Grand Concourse. Where the hell is everybody? Diablo. It's like they've given up. Sorry, we are CLOSED Bye, people! Bye! Carajo. Ungrateful! Our matriarch bites the dust, and this is how we move on? We are not power-less. We are power-full. If Claudia was here, she'd say, "P'alante." In Puerto Rico, blackouts happen all the time, and we still threw a fiesta. This is like Gilligan's Ghetto Island. Mi amor, cálmate, huh? What would Jesus do?

What you mean, the crab is like the best part. No, it is not. It's in the corner for a reason. So what, are you saying you don't like my crab?
