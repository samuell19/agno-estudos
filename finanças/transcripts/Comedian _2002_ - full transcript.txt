[ Mid-tempo jazz plays, vehicles passing ] [ lndistinct conversations ] Hey, guys, life-centered comedy. Come on in . She weighed 1 ,200 pounds, and the guy stayed married to her. Can you imagine that? ''Honey, do you think l look fat in this?'' l have noticed that there is a certain compulsion among stand-up comedians to go onstage and perform . Yeah , unless you wanna go. lt's a real need . [ Applause ] What am l doing here? [ Laughter ] l made it! l had my own show! [ Laughter ] What did l do? l'm back here now! l screwed up. [ Up-tempo jazz plays ] Why are you here? Why am l here? That's a good question . l could ask you the same thing . Well , l did an HBO special last year. l retired everything l've ever written and wanted to start fresh . And you have just these couple little things to hang on to. lt's very strange. lt's very hard to get used to. l was in L.A. last week. Everyone's going , ''l'm not just blowing smoke up your ass.'' You know that expression? Hey, l really thought it was, you know, it was good . And l'm not just blowing smoke up your ass. What is it about having smoke blown up your ass. . . Yeah , l've got, like, two bits, and the rest is. . . shit. [ Cheers and applause ] l tell ya, l could not fuck around with these people, or l was going down , l knew it. But they were with you . That was -- like, you looked like you were having fun . That's my job. [ Up-tempo jazz plays ] l just have no idea what the curve is of when it's gonna be, you know. . . something . . . that's like -- it feels like -- like -- like it used to feel . When you're killing , and while you're up there killing , you're miserable, then it's back where it used to be. When you're like, ''Ah , big deal . l made these idiots laugh .'' [ Laughs ] l saw this lady today with a little, uh -- what was it? l don't even know the names of these little dogs. The really little one. - Chihuahua. - Shih tzu . - Yorkies. No. l don't know. l don't know. l wouldn't even know if you said it. - Rat in a dog suit. - lt doesn't matter. [ Laughter ] You really can just relax, sir. l'll take it from here. [ lndistinct conversations ] This place absolutely has that unmistakable smell of every comedy club l went to starting out in New York -- that -- this kind of wood with , like, with alcohol , the cigarettes. l don't know what it is. lt's so distinctive. Colin Quinn , everyone! [ Cheers and applause ] l just love it. l love walking downstairs. Jerry Seinfeld ! Go in there. lt's all crowded . Everyone's perched . You just go on and grab the mike and bust it out. You know what l mean? The bare essentials. lt's like Tyson fighting with no socks -- just his shorts and his shoes, and that's it. lt is the smelly gym . Yeah . l love the conspiracy people. You always have the friends that think they have the inside dope on everything . l go to the movies with my friend , l go to reach for a straw -- the straw thing , you know -- he goes, ''Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Never take the first straw. ''Don't take the top front straws. ''Always take the straws in the back. ''My nephew used to work here. They rub their balls on the straws.'' [ Laughter ] They rub their balls on the straws? ''That's how they fuck around .'' Really? That's a very nice way to pass the time. He yells at the popcorn kid , ''Don't give us from the top. ''Underneath the top. We don't want the top level . They jerk off in the popcorn . My cousin used to work here.'' He's like, ''Don't give us ginger ale. They piss in the ginger ale. My brother used to work'' -- Sounds like the problem might be your relatives. lt's a real pleasure to bring this next guy to the stage. lt's been a pleasure to watch him grow in the last few months. How about a big hand for Jerry Seinfeld , everybody? [ Cheers and applause ] People always say to me, ''lt must be so easy.'' lt's not easy. What's easy? For me, now, because people know who l am . No, you get a little bit of a break up front. You're goddamn right! [ Cheers and applause ] Yeah . And then , uh , you still gotta be funny. That's the beauty of stand-up, though . That's the -- that's why it's closest to justice. Not that it's just, ultimately, but it's close to justice. Even Jack Nicholson , who everybody loves, if he's in the middle of a comedy show, everybody'd give him five minutes of grace. And then they'd be like, ''Okay, Jack, you know, if you're not making us laugh , get going .'' You know what l mean? He's the most beloved person there is. Right. So, in the end , whatever it is -- whether it's three days or seven days -- you're still irritated , still annoyed , still frustrated , still hating the whole experience all the way through . And , now, my point here. . . [ Laughter ] What is my point? God damn it. [ Laughter ] [ Groans ] [ Laughter ] l got off on that whole thing about the number. Oh , damn it. l don't know. l don't know. What was it about? And it's -- l didn't even want to say what l just said . That's the ugly part. l don't remember. Anyway, there's something good there about -- WOMAN : ls this your first gig? [ Laughter ] Yeah . Yes, it is, actually. [ Laughter ] [ Applause ] No, l , uh -- Well , you know, uh , doing all -- all this stuff l have never said before to anyone. These are thoughts. This is how comedians develop material . And , uh , as you can see, it's quite painful . [ Laughter ] The equivalent for a normal person would be to go into work in your underwear and try and do your job that you normally do. All of a sudden , you can't do anything . That's how a comedian feels when he's doing a new bit. l'll tell you what's funny -- that think-tank bit. - Oh , come on ! - What? That's so stupid . l would always -- l always thought this -- l hear about these places called a think tank. l mean , it's just really -- just a bunch of smart guys, and they bring in problems and try and solve them , right? Nick Depaulo has a friend who's in a think tank in Boston . Really? Nick, where's your friend -- where is he in a think tank? l can't believe that many people have heard of a think tank. - [ Laughing ] - l'm thinking here. What do you think people say when they go, ''l can't even think''? They say, ''Wanna go for lunch? Just give me two more minutes.'' [ Laughing ] ''All right. ''Let's get going . l just want to finish this one thing .'' He just sits there looking at you . lt's in there. lt's in there. lt would be kind of cool if there was a submarine, too. Descend into the tank, and we'll let you up. Well , that's the tank aspect of it. Yeah . And they won't let you up till you have, like, five thoughts. ''What do you got?'' ''Uh , what about, uh , a pair of shoes with'' -- ''No.'' Shut the door on you . So when you go for the interview -- He doesn't think. lf you know how to think -- You know, sometimes, you just don't think. You just don't think. That's why they fire you . They fire -- ''What do you mean you're letting me go? Why?'' ''Because sometimes you just don't think.'' That is very funny. ''lf you think that's thinking , you better think again .'' ''l swear, l'm racking my brains.'' ''That's what you think.'' ''Hey, Johnson , l see you sitting in there.'' ''l don't know what you're thinking .'' [ Laughter ] ''To me, it's like you don't even think sometimes!'' ''l swear, boss, l'm racking my brains.'' ''Maybe that's what you think!'' Mark my word , that think-tank bit is gonna be big . - Yeah . - [ Laughs ] [ vehicle horn honks ] Now, l've tried biking . And don't bike in the city. Oh , no, don't do it. l just got a ticket for running a red light on my bicycle. l got pulled over by a cop on a bicycle. This guy's chasing me for three blocks. He's like, ''Ring-ring ! Ring-ring !'' [ Laughter ] ''Move away from the bicycle. Move away from the bicycle!'' See, l'm not 1 00%%% confident about this stuff, and that's what kills me. lf you're not behind it 1 00%%% , you can't sell it. l tape all my shows because, uh , that way l can go home and see what works and what doesn't work. [ lndistinct speaking on television ] Back to you , Phil . [ Laughter ] Did l say ''Potatoes are good for you'' twice? And my mind does not stop writing , and that's why l'm up all night worried , because l'm thinking about all the jokes. You know, if l'm doing a show on being Jewish , l can pull out the ''Jewish'' stuff. lf l want to do dating , here's ''Dating .'' ''Old jokes to rotate in .'' These are all screenplays l've written . Look at that. These are all my journals. All my journals. lt's all here. lt's all here. This is it. These are all jokes. These are jokes, jokes, jokes. l can't believe how much work l've done. l have dreams at night that -- that all the material l've created is just gonna fall on me and kill me and suffocate me. [ Groans ] [ lndistinct speaking on television ] Ohh ! ''Ohh !'' l love that little dance. That's painful , watching yourself on tape. Even if you're doing well , you're like, ''Damn , look at my -- look at the way my hand moved or. . .'' - Hey, Jerry. - How you doing? Got it figured out? Now you've added more pressure to my night. l was going to do at least 7 0%%% new stuff, and at least a 1 00%%% a new order, and open with something l've never opened with before. - Really? - Yes. Wow. [ Both laugh ] Not impressed , are you? No, l am . l wouldn't do that. - Really? - No. - Why is that? - You're crazy. You're taking your life in your hands. ls he bringing me up? ls he? Poor guy. He's a goner. l realized today when l walk by a cute girl , 9 times out of 1 0, l'll turn around and look at her ass. And 1 0 times out of 1 0, she doesn't look around to look at mine. And that's depressing . All right, l gotta go. Thank you very much , everybody. Good night. Listen , everybody thinks you're funny until you're funny, and then they don't say you're funny anymore. So when a comic comes up and goes, ''You're really funny,'' that means you're not funny. That's like you're an open-miker. And then the minute you get really funny, then -- then they turn on you , and the jealousy in this business is ridiculous. And the amount of that that l've had to battle -- l mean , everyone's like, ''Orny's so cocky, Orny's so this.'' l'm just sure of myself, and l've never been condescending to anybody else. Normally what l do is l open with , like, three or four minutes, l do a couple of new stuff, and then l go in , you know. That's the right way to do it. You always need to establish yourself, establish the audience, 'cause you're never really comfortable. Even though you may think you are, you never really are. Right. l know. But l thought l could -- l did it the other night. Yeah , l've done it, too, and it's still a mistake. Yeah . Good luck following that. [ Loud cheers ] Fuck him . You know, when Jerry gets up there, they're standing , they're on their feet. You know, l brought him up the other night. Everyone stands up. l didn't know if they were standing up because l was leaving or he was coming , but they stand up. very nice. Thank you very much . [ Cheers and applause ] Good job, Jerry. Whoo. Come on out. You can give -- Oh , here comes more advice. l think more important to me is the celebrity. l would like to right now have everybody in this restaurant looking at me going , ''That is Orny Adams. ''That is him . That guy's funny. l really respect what he does.'' You get to a point, you're like, ''How much longer can l take it?'' ls time running out? Are you out of time? l'm getting older. Please. l'm getting older. lt's odd . Listen , l'm 29. l feel like l've sacrificed so much of my life. The last three years have been a blur. Do you have something else you would rather have been doing? You got other appointments or other places you gotta be? - Not necessarily, but -- - No, not necessarily. l see all my friends are making a lot of money -- a lot of money on Wall Street. You what? l just see the -- like, my friends are -- they're moving up, and l'm worried -- - They're moving up? - They're moving up. Are you outta your mind? No, l'm not outta my mind . l just, uh -- This has nothing to do with your friends. - l've upset you . - No, no. This is a special thing . This has nothing to do with making it or -- Did you ever stop and compare your life and go, ''Okay, l'm 29. ''My friends are all married , they're all having kids, ''they all have houses, they have some sort of sense of normality.'' Let me tell you a story. What do you tell your parents? How do you deal with that? ''What do you tell your parents?'' Yes. You know, like how do you -- This is your -- Your parents? Let me tell you a story about -- This is my favorite story about show business. Glenn Miller's orchestra, they were doing some gigs somewhere. They can't land where they're supposed to land because it's winter, snowy night. So they have to land , like, in this field and walk to the gig . And they're dressed in their suits. They're ready to play. They're carrying their instruments. So they're walking through the snow, and it's wet and it's slushy. And in the distance they see this little house. And there's lights on on the inside and this billow of smoke coming out of the chimney. They go up to the house, and they look in the window, and in the window, they see this -- this family. There's a guy and his wife, and she's beautiful . And there's two kids. And they're all sitting around the table. And they're smiling , they're laughing , and they're eating . And there's a fire in the fireplace. And these guys are standing there in their suits, and they're wet and they're shivering , they're holding their instruments. And they're watching this incredible Norman Rockwell scene. This one guy turns to the other guy and goes, ''How do people live like that?'' - That's what it's about. - Right. lt was beautiful . And the advice that he gave me, just, it reassured me of all the feelings that l have. That's the way l feel . Yes, Jerry, l am doing something different. People are scared of me, but you're right. l should stand strong . And every time l hear that from the industry, l'm just gonna think, ''Seinfeld told me to stand strong .'' [ Mid-tempo jazz plays ] Were you a class clown-type like George was? No. Well , when did you start making people laugh? Well , l made friends laugh , but l never liked to -- - Friends. - Yeah . You were the funny guy in the group. Well , everybody was funny. Don't you think? When you were growing up, everybody was funny. And then , at some point, everybody went off and got jobs. Lenny Bruce and Robert Klein , really, was, like -- and George Carlin . That's really the genesis of every comedian you see working today. Everyone from my generation wanted to be like this guy. Robert Klein -- how about another round of applause? [ Cheers and applause ] My parents, uh , retired to South Florida. Uh , they're gone now, but l'll tell you the truth , l have a beef with South Florida. l don't know what it is. l mean , l tell you , l'm sick about it! Bitter! l sent two healthy, 65-year-old retired parents to South Florida. 30 years later, dead ! [ Laughter and applause ] l mean , what is it -- the water, the air? lt's a death camp! They live in a very cozy place called Section 2 1 . [ Laughter ] You're on the way down . [ Laughter ] Where can you go from the biggest show of all time? That's the way it is. You want to be a comedian -- ls anybody here kind of thinking about it at all , maybe in the back of your mind? Yeah , just kind of thinking about it? You , sir? [ Light laughter ] Well , this is what it is. l mean , you can't get bigger than me. [ Loud laughter ] And look, l'm still shit. . . always shit. That is lesson number one. ln comedy. . . it's always shit. l fuckin' hate it. - You do? - No, l don't. l just didn't have a good set today. l made that rookie mistake of opening with the new material 'cause you're excited about it and you want to try it, but you're not ready to do it. You want to make sure you don't forget it, and you feel like -- almost like that new stuff is gonna open up all this other new stuff where you know you'll do 30 new minutes. Right. The oldest delusion in the book, right? Yup. You gotta go in there and get them to go, ''Oh , yeah , this guy is the man .'' Then you can do whatever you want. And then , suddenly, you're not the man . And you know they think you're not the man , or that's what you're thinking they're thinking . Exactly. They might not necessarily think that, but in your mind , that's it. [ Slow-tempo jazz plays ] What l was saying to Colin the other night, l said , ''l'm not gonna go out Saturday night anymore. They're too juiced up and all the date night.'' He just set me straight. He said , ''No, it does not matter what the audience is. Get up every night anywhere you can . . .'' Work, work, work, work, work. ''. . .early, late, good -- it doesn't matter.'' And , of course, l went, ''Of course it doesn't matter.'' When you're crafting an act, you need to see how that material works in front of each different type of situation . [ Harmonica plays ] Good . What's going on? T. Sean Shannon , everybody. Come on ! Yes! Yes! Yes! . . .his very funny television show. Ladies and gentlemen , the one and only Jerry Seinfeld ! [ Cheers and applause ] l'd like to do another set. Jerry Seinfeld . [ Cheers and applause ] " lf you want a dollar, then here's what you must do " Jerry Seinfeld ! [ Cheers and applause ] [ lndistinct conversation ] You gotta work. You gotta work it, work it, work it, work it. Well , the mad cow disease is back. What l love about it is that we find a way to blame it on the cow. lt's not our fault. Those cows are nuts. [ Laughter ] l had a good , solid 20 minutes. 20 minutes in three months is a ton . Think about the concept -- a beauty contest. ''You're very attractive. l challenge you .'' They have complete confidence in that plastic. What do we know about the Glad sandwich bag? Well , it keeps the sandwich fresh . l'll pick up shit with it. 20 minutes is not comedy. An hour, an hour and 1 5 minutes, that's comedy, you know? You learn how to open , how to sustain , how to pace. What are you doing? This weekend? Working here. [ Yawns ] But certain trends l'm looking forward to come to an end . Ladies, the outline around the lip. . . is over. l wish l could just say to all the women on behalf of the men of planet Earth , we see your lips! That's why l'm doing this. l'm scared . That l'm not gonna be able to do it anymore if l don't keep doing it, that it might leave me. " Looks so natural , no one can tell " " Looks so natural " You ever heard of this product ''Just For Men''? - Yes. - lt takes away the gray. " No one can . . . " l love the commercial for Hair Color For Men . Did you ever see it? With the song . " Looks so natural , no one can tell " Everyone can tell . l meant to time that set, but l'm definitely feeling like l've got a very solid 30 minutes. Are you gonna go on first, or are you gonna wait? l'll wait. l thought there was so much more here. Hold on . l'm getting to it. Don't you push me around here, folks. Do they still get drunk Friday night, second show? lt's better than it used to be, but tonight was kind of getting there. l wouldn't want to go on now, l'll tell you that. No, just go. They kicked me out of your club tonight twice. Well , it's not my club, it's theirs, and it looks like it's gonna happen again . [ Laughter ] " Looks so natural , no one can tell " " You are drunk " You guys clap when he's mean . No one can tell . When l'm mean , you guys are like, ''Oh , what a dick!'' " One, two -- one, two, three " Where are you from? Nice to meet you . Oh , okay. Hi , how are you doing? Okay. How's it going , Jerry? Good , how are you doing? Yeah , we just shook. Nice to meet you . We just shook. Why do we have to do it again? Folks comin' in late, yeah . Y'all just missed Jerry Seinfeld . How fucked up do you feel now? How bad do you feel?! How much new stuff you got? l got about, uh , 40 minutes. - Really? - Yeah . And you're happy with all of it? l think -- l mean , l started with nothing . l know. And so, it was like -- When you started with nothing , when you -- when you just erased it all , the first time you went on , you had , like, what, five minutes? Five minutes, yeah . lt was awful . And you just -- you didn't say, ''Let me do one old joke to get a laugh and then l'll'' -- No. - Really? - No. lt's only, actually -- l've been doing it about four months. lt's only been , l would say, the past month that l'm actually starting to feel comfortable going onstage. . . not having that not-good feeling going up ''This might not work,'' which , you know, l haven't had for years. That feeling of ''l don't know if this is gonna work.'' Yeah . l'm trying to get it together now. l'd like -- l'd like to, you know, two months from now, l think, l should be able to go to work somewhere and do 45 minutes. So, does it feel like the old act, George? Oh , well , it's not quite the old act, but it's, uh , you're certainly on your way. l mean , the progress that you made in four months is amazing . Yeah . The old act, you know, that was -- you started when you were 2 1 , 22 years old . Yeah , right, right. lt's very close to a marriage-type relationship. - Good . Nice to see you . - Nice to see you . My oldest client's Carl Reiner, and he's 7 8. That's right. [ Laughter ] - George Burns, he was 1 00. - That's right. But Jerry's gonna work -- do a date when he's 1 00. Did you book it already? l didn't -- What? Did you book that yet? lt's gonna be the Palladium . We're talking . [ Laughter ] We're gonna lock it up while l'm still -- while l'm still here. Can you believe you're in charge of deciding whether our brilliant ideas are good or not? All these talented people, all these -- money, Tv credits, and they come up here, and you get to decide what's good and what's not good , and we believe you . And what the hell do you know about it? Nothing . You know nothing . You've never written a joke. Most of you aren't funny. . . probably all of you . You wouldn't be here if you were funny. You wouldn't need to come to this. But just think of how you would feel , you know, if l came into your office and said , you know, ''l don't like the things you say at these meetings. ''l don't know anything about your business, ''l don't have a reason , l don't even work here. ''l just thought l'd come in off the street and give you a piece of my mind .'' ''And what gives me the authority? l bought two drinks.'' [ Laughter ] [ Piano plays slowly ] [ lndistinct conversations ] l don't really believe in the festivals. l think l have talent. [ vehicles passing ] l don't have a manager. l don't have an agent. l don't have a deal . l don't have any access to L.A. You know, Jerry's saying , ''Go to L.A. , go to L.A.'' This will get me to -- lf l go to Montreal , and l have a good set -- and l can't see how l can't have a good set at this point in my career. l real-- l can't. lt's inconceivable to me at this point. This is, like, a huge opportunity, but in the scheme of life, l'm the one with talent. They have a festival , and yet they're making my goddamn knees weak. l've mastered the art. l am ready. l just went in , and l looked at the stage. lt's like it's a woman . l just want to mount it. l just wanna get on that stage and destroy. Mr. Orny Adams, everybody. [ Applause ] Thank you . Let me just give a little advice to the industry. Stretch before l go up on stage. 'Cause when you come running after me, l don't want you to pull a muscle or something . Last year, l thought l had lupus. Has that happened to you yet? [ Laughter ] l was on the bus, and there was an ad -- ''Chances are, somebody on the bus has lupus.'' l look around , l'm the only one on the bus. Two nights in a row of not sleeping . Frantic, nervous energy. l go to sleep for like a half-hour. l wake up. l turn the Tv on . l get bored of the Tv. l shut it off. l put on music. l shut that off. l go back to Tv. l lie down for 1 0 minutes. l get up. You know, it's nuts. l do some writing , and l'm relaxed . l'm single. . .by choice. Whoo! Not my choice. [ Clears throat ] Apparently, the women had a meeting behind my back. l got blacklisted or something . WOMAN : Gay? No. Thank you for asking , though . l appreciate that. ''Are you gay?'' No. Shut the fuck up and let me do my routine. Twice in two weeks, and l've never, ever had that before. People think they look so cool on their cellphones, don't they? Everybody's so cool , especially the people still talking on the first cellphones ever made. These people are walking around like, ''Oh , yeah , look at me!'' [ Laughter and applause ] ''Oh , yeah . l work on Wall Street. Yeah . ''Oh , what's that? ''Hang on a second . Let me put the antenna up. Excuse me, excuse me.'' [ Cheers and applause ] Good night, everybody. [ Cheers and applause ] Then l walked offstage and l went like this to the Montreal people 'cause they gave me a wink and the thumbs-up. Hi , Mom . lt's your son . Good . Good . l was just officially told l got it. Yeah , so. . . Yes, you can tell people, you can book airline tickets, you can do whatever you want -- l'm going to Montreal . [ Laughs ] l got up there and l said one -- l go, ''l'm single by choice.'' And this girl goes, ''Maybe you're gay.'' l know. Bunch of animals. Bunch of animals. All right. Bye-bye. Love you too. [ Horn honks ] Running out of people to call . lt's delicate between who you can -- who you call and who you're rubbing it in to. Everybody's away. l can never be happy. l'm -- l'm unhappy again , everybody. Oh , God . Somebody -- Somebody is gonna have to marry me. Do you realize there is some girl out there right now having fun , and she doesn't even realize she has to spend [ Laughing ] the rest of her life with me. [ Laughing ] She's out there right now, enjoying life, not realizing the rest of it's with me. Hey, honey? l hope you're having fun now 'cause it's all coming to an end . l was happy for, what, four minutes? l made 55 phone calls in four minutes. . . and now l'm miserable again . l never felt pain until l started doing comedy. [ lntroduction to ''Love and Happiness'' by Al Green plays ] " Love and happiness " [ lndistinct talking ] " Something's going wrong " Oh , they're done. Shit. What about Carolines? Think they're still working? Yeah , is the show still working? Um , no, actually, the show is almost over. Oh , right. Can l still get on? [ Laughter and applause ] [ Cheering ] " Love and happiness " These comedians, they always complain -- ''l can't go up now. l can't follow this.'' How bizarre is this evening now? [ Cheering ] You thought it was pretty bizarre, didn't you? This guy's dancing around with a G-string on and wigs. ls there anything more different from me than that? [ lndistinct talking ] And it was fine. What is this urge to get information we already have? Whenever l'm in a car and l drive by a mirrored office building , l look in the reflection to see if l'm in the car. - [ Laughter ] - Whoo! This is information l already have. What am l looking for? Why am l checking? And what would l do if l looked and l saw that there was a small Korean woman driving my car? [ Laughter and applause ] l don't know what l would do then . l would have to stop the car. . . get out, go up to the reflection . . . and if it was still a small Korean woman , go, ''All right. l stand corrected . [ Laughter ] ''Apparently, l am a small Korean woman . Who wants a manicure?'' [ Laughter ] Thank you very much . Those people, you know, they came here to see Angel Salazar. lt's late -- tired , finished . lf -- lf something is good , it's good . [ Up-tempo music plays ] Here we go. Thank God . l'm gonna meet with the guy who's gonna change my life. George Shapiro. You don't expect to ever meet George Shapiro. You don't expect to ever be taken out to dinner by George Shapiro. You don't expect George Shapiro to be interested in you . l mean , George Shapiro has worked with some of the best talent in the last, you know, 30 or whatever years that he's been in the business. So, we're gonna meet Orny. The best comics in the world are the comics that, you know, get their material from their heart and their soul . And he seems to have done that. You know, he did ''Seinfeld .'' Cool . But was it luck? Who knows, you know? You know, lightning's got to strike twice in this business for you to be a legend . l mean , he's already a legend , but, l mean , to be, you know. . . Here we are -- midtown ! This is where it all happens. Showtime! l don't know what he's looking for. You know, he's probably meeting several people. l want George to walk up to me and go. . . ''Let's dance.'' l see it on the left. See that sign that says ''Bice''? ''The '80s still thrive at this pricey midtown northern-ltalian serving power pastas to beautiful people --'' that's me -- ''on expense accounts --'' that's George -- ''and Eurotrash . ''lt's a stylish , if no longer trendy, scene that critics call --'' oh , l love this -- '''overpriced , overhyped , over-everything .''' Bring it on . We had a very nice, long dinner, and the upswing is George has offered to manage me. He said , you know, ''We're -- We're very interested . We think that --'' And this is after hours of just -- We went over everything -- our philosophies -- uh , philosophies on integrity, how do we think we would work together, what they would do as far as Montreal , as far as, like, deals -- how to, you know -- how to go through each deal and find out which is right for me. l-l had all sorts of concerns, and l voiced them differently. Like, l would say. . . ''Now, a lot of people would say ''George Shapiro has too much money. He doesn't care.'' l said , you know, ''What's your motivation to get behind me?'' And , uh , he said three words -- uh -- ''love of comedy'' -- that he loves comedy and that he sees my integrity and the way l work. . . Okay, this is good . l'm gonna go up -- lt's good to finish the interview with him . Don't you think? lt's awkward . We're gonna go upstairs. l'll be upstairs in room 7 0 7. Oh , really? That's. . . l want to hear the game. Oh , you can't hear? Well , you know, l feel silly. Uh , okay, l'm gonna be on the other side. So if you need me, call me. You do the interview. Yeah , do you want to go up -- go up to your room . l don't, uh . . . l can hear it now. They put it on loud . lt's gonna interfere with the audio, but that's okay. Um . . . Man , seven points. . . [ Laughs ] Ahh ! ''Hey, we'd like to give Orny a $ 7 00,000 -- The Lakers are on !'' Listen , part of me feels like l'm handing George Shapiro a gift. [ Horn honks ] [ Laughing ] SElNFELD: This is really one of those nights -- the classic New York night where you just stand in front of catch -- You know, you did your set, you just stand like this, and try and pick up girls on the street. l always say your number of years in comedy is about your maturity level . [ Laughs ] When you're doing it ten years, you're like a ten-year-old . [ Slurring ] Oh , that's right. Hmm? Yeah ! [ Laughter ] 1 5 -- you're like a 1 5-year-old -- you're start-- slight bit of maturity. When you eat salad . . . Yes? Then you go to the bathroom . . . do you see the salad? l don't think so. No? 20 years -- you're, like, kind of a grown-up but still completely infantile. Excuse me, did you want any dessert, coffee, or anything? They have great cheesecake, you know. lt's amazing . What -- apple pie. You have apple pie? Mm-hmm . Yeah , l'll have a piece of apple pie. We're out of the apple pie. All right, then you know what? Cancel it. [ Laughs ] l still say you're gonna regret not getting that cheesecake. l do that joke all the time, and Jessica always laughs. - What joke? - That's a good wife. ''Cancel it''? When someone says they're out of something , l say, ''You know what -- then cancel it.'' l didn't even get it. l was like, ''Yeah , cancel it.'' Well , you can't cancel something you can't get. - l get it now. - lt's automatically canceled . l'm saying at first l didn't get it. [ Up-tempo music plays ] Bonjour, Montreal . Oh , my God , l died ! l had the worst set of my life! [ Laughs ] That's me -- ugh -- every night. ''What happened?'' Today's Gazette. Read -- Read this paragraph to me. Right there. May -- don't touch it. Oh , l'm sorry. ''Young stand-up Orny Adams destroys.'' ls that you? Orny Adams? That's your real name? Get out of town . No mom would name her kid Orny Adams. There was a time in America -- women -- they didn't even have the right to vote. Then there was a vote to see if they could vote. Well , how the fuck did we lose that?! [ Laughter ] l delivered under pressure. l give myself a B-plus. l give myself a B-plus. But tomorrow night -- same time, okay, Orn? Here l am . This kid ripped the front page of my paper, but. . . ''Stand up and deliver. ''Comedyfest can be a career-maker. Orny Adams calls it 'the draft.''' This is the best part right here. ''See 'Orny' on page A-1 0.'' [ Laughs ] '''Orny' continued .'' l think this article was so well-written . They took three rolls of film , and that's the picture they put in there? ls anybody else shocked with the picture? God , it looks like the picture they're gonna put in the newspaper when l get killed in a car crash . ''Comic killed !'' You know? l gotta open my own door? ''The National Post'' -- right there, baby, that's me. Front page today. Anybody read that? [ Light clapping ] Anybody -- nobody reads this goddamn paper? [ Laughter ] l make it on the front page of my first national paper and nobody reads it? [ Laughter ] l'm sorry, but this audience sucks. [ lndistinct talking ] l don't care how you -- how you put it. They suck. Because l'm a competent, professional comic that does it every night. And it's like they're polite and they laugh , but they're not like. . . l'm on the front page of your paper. [ Laughs ] That cracks me up. lt's a 7:00 show! lt's 7:00 -- look at this. . . Anybody ready to go out? Comedy isn't a daytime thing . l just really thought l could do more with the paper, and l was proud to be in the paper. And l'm just, you know -- it's too bad nobody reads it. That show gave me a headache. [ Guffaws with French accent ] [ Chuckles ] lt is frustrating . lmagine. lmagine how many -- how many people are out there to see me tonight. [ Guffaws ] Heh . All rise for George Shapiro. The honorable George Shapiro. [ Translation from French ] How's it going? Certainly! Wow! This is a treasure. They did an exclusive. - [ Laughs ] - [ Laughs ] So -- So l take some meetings. . . Don't get carried away. - l'm not getting carried away. - Relax. George, it's easy to say when you got money in the bank. Well . . .l'll give you some money. Here. . . You want Canadian or American? American , please. That's the dumbest question l've ever heard . - [ Laughs ] - [ Laughs ] And l'm gonna take it! That's just a l-- Absolutely take it. - No, no, no. - No, you got to take it. You might have some more fun . You printed up those cards. Those cards are worth at least $ 1 ,000 to me to have a card like this that says, ''l'm with George.'' - l can't take it. - You got to take it. l love it here so far. - Love it. Love it. - [ lndistinct talking ] - [ Laughs ] - [ Laughs ] Are you working this weekend? l will be at ''New Faces'' tonight at, uh , Cafe Campus -- l have a 9:30 show -- and , uh , you can come out and see if l live up to that hype. That's -- That's what's most nerve-racking . lt's like l've got to live up to this -- this image that not only have l created but the media has created . What have you been -- how long have you been doing it and where have you been holding your sets and all of that stuff? Well , as soon as the audience quiets down , l will answer that question . - Ooh . - Shh . Ooh . Thank you . Just have some fun with it, you know. This is -- This is your -- no pressure -- but this is your shot. - l'm ready, my man . - Go get 'em . . . .from New York City. Give him a hand -- Orny Adams. - [ Rock music plays ] - [ Applause ] Whoo! ADAMS : Hello, everybody, how you doing? [ Laughs ] l love Cuban people. They're the most buoyant people in the world . They'll float over on anything . They'd come over on this. They'd be like, ''Come on , everybody! We're going to America! Come on !'' [ Laughter ] Do you think l'm gonna be a big star, George? They're throwing obstacles in front of you on the way back to the hotel . They're tricky. Do you think l'm gonna be a big star? Yes. And l think you'll still be unhappy. You'll still be -- Why you gotta curse me like that? - Only because you told me that. - l'm ready. l'm ready. So, now, i-if l blow it, then l don't get to that next level . Hey, Barry. - How you doing , sir? - Did you see it? - How'd it go tonight? - Did you see it? No, l didn't -- l didn't see you tonight. l'm sorry. - l wish you had . - His best night of his life. l only, uh . . . He's got a lot of respect for me, that's all . No, l do. l had a great roast joke, but l respect you so much that l couldn't do it. - A joke? - l do a roast and , uh . . . What was the joke? Can l tell you -- but all in good fun? Yes. l said , ''George Shapiro -- ''l respect this guy so much , you know. ''Represents Seinfeld , now Orny Adams. . . What's next -- the parrot from 'Baretta'?'' [ Chuckles ] lt's not bad . But l , uh . . . That's -- That was soft. Hear what he says about me to my face. Yeah , let's hear. You want to hear the opinion , or should l not say anything? l don't care. Oh , no, of course not. This is my opinion of this young man . This is what l tell him all the time. All he has to do -- all he ever has to do with his career -- if he can do it -- is just. . . And let the act speak for itself onstage. And l told him , ''Steven Wright doesn't walk around ''talking about what's gonna happen here, ''how my life's gonna go, ''what development deal l'm gonna get, what's gonna happen , l got Montreal . . .'' He walks onstage, and he says, ''Thanks.'' And he gets off and says, ''Thanks.'' And where is Steven Wright now? Steven is one of the most prolific, brilliant stand-up comedians of our generation . And where is he now? He won an Academy Award . For what? For a film . A short film . l want you to do well . l'm not telling you this because l want you to suck and have people hate you . l know, but l-l think that l've -- Forget what you think. Forget anything what you think. Just take it. Take what l'm saying . And just relax and take it. [ Laughs ] ''Relax'' is something you can tell me. That -- - You're a great comic. - That's what we all say. You're doing great. You've worked so fucking hard , and it's coming together. So where the act is coming together, take the other side and have it come together. l got to watch this guy. All right, Barry. Thank you . Thank you . [ lndistinct talking ] What a cocksucker. [ Man laughing ] He's such a cock-- He doesn't know what the f-- l'm gonna sit there and let that guy talk to me like that? He didn't say anything bad . He just told you to relax. Which is what l've been telling you . Just relax. Enjoy what's happening -- l'm just gonna start doing what George does -- not listen and just smile. [ Chuckles ] There was nothing he said that l would -- l would refute. [ Mid-tempo jazz plays ] Big city. lt's only been like six months, which isn't long to be attempting a full set. l never thought l'd be this far along . You know, it's all about doing the hour where you're the entertainment for the evening . So l booked a date in Washington , D.C. at The lmprov. We're gonna do the first show on a Saturday. l have this image in my mind of what a comedian is supposed to be that l'm always trying to live up to and that l always fall short of. This is so exciting . l'm the show for the night. l have to make that evening work for those people. l'll be more obsessed with remembering everything than really caring whether l did well or not. Coffee. . . Starbucks, lips. . . men's attention , construction site. . . beauty contest. . . the equator. . . DNA, blind man . . . nose hair. [ Exhales ] - [ Whistles ] - [ Bottle opens ] Hi , John? Uh , this is George Shapiro. Okay, so we'll -- we'll come down now. Yeah , okay. We're on our way. Bye. [ Slow jazz plays ] Wow, this feels really good . [ Laughter ] l'll probably do about 50 and then l'll come off. And l'll go back and maybe do another 5 or 1 0. Leave you alone to get your thoughts together. - Okay, thanks. - Nice meeting you . Nice meeting you . [ lndistinct talking ] [ Exhales ] COMEDlAN : l bought a pair of jeans. l wore them out on a date that night. And l knew the date wasn't gonna go anywhere sexually 'cause l was out of chloroform and rags. [ lndistinct talking ] And then Barry's just gonna bring you out right there. . . - [ Laughter ] - right from the stage. And l'll bring you the water. l'll just come up -- Would you rather -- Why don't l just -- l'll just take this bottle with me. You sure? Yeah , that's fine. lf you don't mind , could l just get a quick picture with you -- Not right now. Later. - After the show? - Yeah . Okay, l appreciate it. Thanks. - [ lndistinct talking ] - [ Laughter ] SElNFELD: l've been living back in New York since l , uh , finished the little business l was doing in L.A. l moved out about, uh , 1 0, 1 5 years ago. And now l'm back and there's a lot of. . . . . .on the West side. lt's, uh , turned into kind of a baby neighborhood -- a lot of families, a lot of little babies. There's too many babies. l'm having a. . . People picking up after their dogs. [ lndistinct talking ] [ Laughter ] Why the trends? Why. . . Do human beings pay these huge, massive. . . The blind man gets the best woman , in my opinion . . . Got to do what you can do in life. Got to try and have fun . That's why you're here tonight. How stupid did you feel the day after the millennium? EMCEE : Please welcome Mr. Jerry Seinfeld ! [ Loud cheering ] [ lndistinct talking ] Everybody give a big hand . . . [ Cheers and applause ] Wow, how did that go by so quick? [ lndistinct talking ] l don't know why l feel like this -- This is so hard . lt just feel-- l-l guess l kind of got a little ahead of myself, and l think l was expecting more. l thought the performance was, uh . . . lt just didn't have the confidence l wanted it to have. Have -- Have you been onstage for, like, 53 minutes before? For that length of time straight? No. Not in two years. That's the accomplishment tonight. You know, you stumbled a couple of times but. . . lt's a whole different ball game. lt's so fucking hard to get comfortable. lt just comes and goes. There are just, like, just little glimpses, little moments where l feel really like myself and l feel comfortable. And then the rest of it l'm , like, in my father's suit with these huge sleeves and legs and l'm going . . . l-l'm thinking , ''What am l wearing? What -- What am l doing here?'' - " Sometimes l think " - What's that? ls there weather in East Hampton? - " l've almost " - There was a chance of rain . " Fooled myself " l would think you have to do it four times a week -- on the weekends, do it. l mean , you know, l can't -- l can't really go back to that life. - " Sometimes l think " - l don't want -- l can't go back on the road for seven months a year. . . " l've almost fooled myself " - You know? - [ Jessica laughs ] l have another life now. [ Laughs ] " Spreading out my wings " [ Laughs ] " Above us like a tree " " Laughing now, out loud " EMCEE : Everybody, big round of applause. Why must l overreact? Eh . . . lt's gonna be all right. But l really had a good -- l really had a momentum going . l really had some writing momentum and . . . lt's not like it takes it all the way back to square one. Yeah . l don't know. Just misstep for a couple days and then you're back. Yeah . No big deal . Piece of cake. [ Laughing ] You know, when l was starting out l used to sit down and write a couple times a week. And then one day l was watching these construction workers go back to work and l was watching them kind of trudging down the street. . . And l was, uh , just -- it was like a -- a revelation to me, and l realized , ''These guys don't want to go back to work after lunch , but they're going .'' 'Cause that's their job. And l think if they can exhibit that level of dedication for that job, l should be able to do the same. Just trudge your ass in . [ Laughter ] ls there a point where we're all gonna stop telling each other to wait. . .for the beep?! [ Laughter ] lt's the 2 1 st goddamn century. The Hutu tribesmen of the African plain know about the beep. They don't leave a message until they hear. . . [ Speaks African gibberish ] Beep. [ Laughter ] Can we all stop asking each other to leave our name and number? No one needs this. Anybody getting messages like, ''This is a woman . Goodbye.'' [ Laughter ] ''l am a lawyer. Contact me immediately.'' Click. l don't think so! ADAMS : lt's 3:00 P.M. lt's noon in L.A. l've never been so conscious of L.A. time. Since Montreal it's like -- that's all l think about -- ''What time is it in L.A.? ''Who's talking about me right now? What conversations are going on?'' l tested for a pilot, and the executive said that my hair made me look like a serial killer. We're doing ''Letterman .'' l'm under so much pressure. Because it's like every second of that routine, every word , has to be perfect. George said , ''Hey, if you don't put him on , we're calling 'The Tonight Show.''' And that's when they said , ''We want Orny. We want him to break on our show.'' l'm gonna go out there and -- and do the best set of my life. . . So Dave comes -- comes out and says, ''Great set'' and then turns to his producer and says, ''When can we have him back?'' l feel censored , but l don't really feel censored . l mean , they're being fair, but they're changing a lot of the wordings of my jokes. Like l can't say l'm getting a tumor from my cellphone. l have to say l'm getting headaches from my cellphone. These little nuances change your rhythm , change your -- the way you would normally say it. Here are the jokes l'm gonna do on ''Letterman .'' l have rewritten ''future wife,'' the ''lupus callback,'' and the ''cellphone.'' Now, with the cellphone bit last night -- l'm at Gotham -- and instead of picking up the chair, all of a sudden l grab my -- l grab my thing and l started going like this and l'm talking into my -- ''Oh , yeah , look at me. l work on Wall Street.'' l'm not compromising now. Now l'm funny 'cause l got a shoe at my ear. l got everything l wanted this year, and l've never been more stressed and more miserable. l'm sweating now 'cause l'm nervous. And the insanity makes you just want to drop everything and say, ''You know what? l give up. l give up.'' You know? l haven't even talked to you for a while. l saw Bill Cosby. . . - three weeks ago. - Really? Best comedy show l ever saw in my life. Really? 'Cause l took, like, 1 5 people. We'd all seen him before. We only knew one bit. He did 2 1 /2 hours. [ Laughs ] The best shit l've -- - l feel like a fucking fraud . - Well , he's the best. What is this? What am l? l'm good ! Who says l'm good? Who says any of us are good? 63 and embracing it. . . Did he have an opening act? No. So, he took an intermission after, like. . . No, he didn't take an intermission . 2 1 /2 hours straight? Pow. Pow. 2 1 /2 hours of killer shit. Killer. And it's so much more edgy now and mean . Ooh , you got to see it. Wow. Boy, l-l'll have to go. [ Mid-tempo jazz plays ] [ Mumbling ] [ Sighs ] Look at them lined up. Look at that. That's funny. Hi , everybody. [ lndistinct talking ] - Hi . Who's waving at me? - [ Women screaming ] Oh , no, l don't need screaming people. [ lndistinct talking ] - Hi . [ Laughs ] - [ Laughs ] - Come on in . - Hi , l'm Orny Adams. Hi , l'm Ally. But it's gonna be good . l'm ready. Psoriasis. . . Psoriasis. They've requested that l not use the word ''lupus'' at the last minute -- which is -- which is fine. We're gonna make the joke work. l'm a -- l'm a joke craftsman now, so. . . What do l do? Do l pull off the show? l mean , l don't want to go on the show and -- and not be me. l'm all positive -- psoriasis. Once l learned how to say the word ''psoriasis.'' l didn't really know what it was. l sort of knew it was a skin condition , but l didn't know it was scaly. l didn't know. . . Originally l thought, ''Let's pick a disease that only women can get'' -- like uterus cancer or something . But you -- you know, obviously you can't say ''cancer.'' l open by saying ''lupus'' and close by saying ''lupus'' so what -- how do you -- how do you dance around that? So. . . So, l'm fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Listen , it's their show. l'm a guest. l'm still thrilled to be here and , uh , it's gonna be -- you know, look at me. lt's gonna be unbelievable, and that's the bottom line. Let's make the best out of it. Psoriasis. Everybody -- to psoriasis. [ Laughs ] [ Chuckles ] l'm gonna be on ''Dave Letterman .'' [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] [ Cheers and applause ] LETTERMAN : From the. . . And musical director. . . Here's who's on the program , ladies and gentlemen , just so you don't leap on that remote control . - [ Laughs ] - Oh . . . Uh , Jay Thomas. Now, let me tell you about Jay Thomas. ls there a funnier man alive than Jay Thomas? PAUL SHAFFER: No, sir. And another funny man -- Orny Adams. - Comedian . - Orny. Orny making his debut right here on the ''Late Show.'' [ lndistinct talking ] Orny Adams. . . Backstage, please. Let's do it. You're going on very shortly, okay? You ready? You have it all? l'm ready. LETTERMAN : Ladies and gentlemen , here's the very funny Orny Adams. Orny. . . [ Cheers and applause ] [ Rock 'n' roll plays ] This is so exciting . l'm happy to be here. Last year l thought l had psoriasis. Has that happened to you yet? l was on a bus and there was an ad -- Chances are that somebody on the bus had psoriasis. l look around , and l'm the only one on the bus. [ Laughter ] ''Looks like l better get to the hospital -- l have psoriasis.'' l got to be honest with you . l-l feel off. l mean , l got up from dinner -- l excused myself 'cause l couldn't even speak. l just -- my eyes started to tear. l don't know what it is. l need to talk to George. l need to know if this is normal . Did Jerry feel this way when he did this? l mean , am l having separation anxiety? What is it? Why do l feel awful? l mean , do you realize l -- l opened my first huge, national network debut set with a joke l've never told before? l've never told -- l've never said ''psoriasis.'' Until this morning , l didn't even know what it was. l don't want to be perfect and be polished and be it because that's the beautiful thing is when you see Jerry and you see Roseanne and you see these people doing it for the first time. They're not polished . They're young , they're excited . This is -- this is the greatest moment, and you see it on their face. And that's what l wanted this to be like. But l want people to understand it. l just want people to understand the process -- what we have to go through as comedians -- what it takes to get there. l don't think people understand . This has been -- you know, l'm 30 years old , and l've been working full-time eight years at this, not to mention l've been daydreaming since junior high , when l wore my inserts walking around , about this moment, and l got there. l did . l used to get up in junior high and repeat the whole monologue from -- from Carson and Letterman . l remember that. And it's like, you know, l've been waiting for this moment. l've been waiting for it, and -- and . . . l guess, you know, l-l just. . . l'm hard on myself, but l hope everybody else isn't as hard on me as l am on myself. [ lndistinct conversations ] [ Laughter ] [ Mid-tempo rock music plays ] l'm not coming here much anymore. l'm done with it. l need to go out and work the road now. l need to go out and do an hour every night. Well , you got enough . That's. . .that's how you -- how you get it together. [ Mid-tempo rock music plays ] l really didn't think l was at this point. l'm still not sure of it, actually. But l have to see how this holds together and how it feels -- does it feel like an act? l was huge! [ Laughter ] Bigger than life! l could be anywhere in the world ! [ Laughter ] Everything -- it's all crazy. l should be at St. Barths. Nothing -- Nothing makes sense. [ Laughter ] l'm in a comedy club in Cleveland . But that's what's working . [ Cheers and applause ] l was just onstage for an hour! You know these type of commercials l'm talking about? The guy just gets in the car, turns to his wife, and goes, ''My doctor said Cramitall .'' [ Laughter and applause ] [ Music continues ] Look at this -- ''Special event. Comedy workshop.'' WOMAN : Welcome to Phoenix. [ Applause ] You should be on here. l'm due in 20. SElNFELD: Okay. Mario Joyner! l feel like l am getting the same laughs now on the same merit system that l got in 1 9 7 9, when nobody knew who l was. Walking -- scooter! Scooter! This set was great. l mean , those two sets were night and day for me. - All right. - [ Yawning ] Good night. [ Music continues ] Well , it's 1 1 :30 in L.A. He goes up there with a fucking act. - How dare you? - [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] l thought we were just fucking around . Don't worry. lt's working . You don't want to go after me. You want to go before, right? - How much time you doing? - l'm doing a full set. lt's all funny stuff. There's no reason why this should not work. - l would like an answer. . . - Am l doing new material? Yeah , it's all new material . So why can't l do what l do and you do what you do? lt's just about being together, isn't it? l just want to be with you . MAN : Please welcome the comic stylings of Mr. Jerry Seinfeld . [ Cheers and applause ] l can only do -- l swear to God -- like 1 0 minutes. l'm hearing all this for the first time, too. l swear to God . This is. . . [ Laughter ] This is the greatest night in comedy in the last 1 0 years. [ Cheers and applause ] You know, since that Sinbad show in the Caribbean . [ Laughter ] MAN : Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , and welcome to Rascals. Tonight we're proud to present an evening with . . . Jerry Seinfeld ! And now, Jerry's special . . . We're flying in from L.A. . . . to work in West Orange, New Jersey, huh? Any new technology just gets translated into a sexual form . Home video -- sex video. Phone -- phone sex! lnternet -- porno website! Copy machine -- put your ass on it! l'll tell you -- That is a tough , tough fucking gang they got out there. Every comedian has a fucking excuse -- it's the candles, it's the smoke. . . Get those candles out! l gotta go on ! l make no excuse. l just wasn't good . Maybe we'll look into that miserable Governor's out in Levittown . That's really Alabama. Long lsland , baby. lt's everything you hate about yourself you see staring right back at you . Everything you tried not to be but you know, deep down , still are. [ Laughter ] - Nice, lively audience. - Oh , good . . . .this limo driver, and , uh . . . What? Did you hear when l stopped at one point and how many people are talking? [ lndistinct conversations ] How well do you have to do before someone's gonna fucking listen up? You know, how big do you fucking have to be? What kind of material do you have to have that you're gonna pay attention? Shut up. [ Laughter and applause ] You are in the way. Well , that was classic! Clas-sic. You looked so smooth and in control . lt didn't look like it was bothering you at all . No, it didn't. That was like. . . monkeys throwing shit. [ Laughter ] Your stuff is great. lt's really strong . lt's really good . Yeah , yeah . l mean , it's -- it's a smooth transition . l was saying how watching you -- like, l remember what it means to have that polish that l don't have. You have it. l think you don't realize it. You know, the only thing you do now that l see is the pause is. . . two seconds longer as you move to the next piece. l was picking stuff tonight. l wasn't sure what to do. Yeah , yeah . l know. But, l mean , to the audience, it comes across as a thoughtful pause as opposed to comics -- you know, knowing , ''Oh , he's --'' [ lmitates tape rewinding ] lt's amazing how long it takes to get those out, how -- you know, l mean , some of this stuff l'm doing six months, but even that's like. . . You know how it is. lt takes you years. lt takes years. lt's amazing . lsn't it weird? l could never do what you did . l could never give it away. 'Cause you always have it in the back -- You know, you always think of your act as like. . . lf you're a comic, your act feeds you . . . it pays the rent. . . - Yeah , but not at this point. - lt's like my exercise. l walk two miles on-- but, see, l've never touched a dime of my ''Tonight Show'' money. l live on the money l make as a comedian . - What are you gonna do with it? - l don't know. You don't know? Think about it. lt keeps you centered . Like if l get fired tomorrow, l'm a comic. lf you're a custodian -- if you wind up as a custodian -- you're still living with this fear that you're gonna wind up working as a garbageman . Remember? l know. He claims it. He -- l swear. But that's what keeps you going . No, it doesn't! lt's idiotic! Stop it already. l remember one time you had a meeting in some office, and you were talking to the security guard for some reason while you were waiting for the elevator, and you're telling me, ''You know, this guy, he was Jackie Kay back in --'' Oh , l remember that guy. You know who that was. lt was a guy that had two series. SElNFELD: You believe that this is going to happen . You don't really believe it, but it just keeps you . . . The only thing that keeps you going is like -- to me, it's like, l watch you do that great story with your parents and the vCR -- that keeps me going . l would love to have a story that long . Well , l enjoy doing the act more than l enjoy doing any-- For example, you said to me, ''You can have all the money that you would make and not do the act, or do the act.'' l'd do the act. You like telling people a joke that they haven't heard . Yeah . l mean , it's fun telling jokes. We used to talk about how it's more fun than anything else. So that's why you run around and do the act all the time when you're not doing the show. Yeah . lf you don't do it, you don't have it. What is this helmet with the -- that is very popular now with the motorcycle riders? You know the helmet l mean -- the slight flaring around the back. What the hell is going on here? You know the helmet. lt's not a full Nazi , but it's a slightly Nazi . What is this shopping moment? Can you explain to me how this happens? You walk into a motorcycle store, the man says, ''May l help you?'' ''Yes. l need a motorcycle helmet.'' ''Well , we have these regular ones over here.'' ''No. Not for me.'' [ Laughter ] ''Well , let me ask you this, sir -- How do you feel about the Nazis?'' [ Laughter ] ''Well , to tell you the truth , l kind of had a problem with the, uh , genocide, hatred , racism , and murder.'' ''What about the helmets?'' ''They weren't bad . l didn't mind the helmet.'' [ Laughter ] ''l didn't like Hitler, but l don't think l had a problem ''with the apparel itself. Yeah , l'll buy that.'' [ Laughter ] l'm supposed to get the, uh , colonoscopy test. When you get into your forties, l think -- l've heard -- from health-care professionals that you -- lt's very important to get the camera up your ass. l have resisted this. . . because l feel the press has invaded my life enough . [ Laughter ] [ Applause ] l feel that l will draw the line here. . . and say no to the pooparazzi . [ Laughter and applause ] Thank you very much . [ Cheers and applause ] lncredible. Jerry. . .

[ Horn honks ] l was thinking of doing the ''Letterman'' spot -- a stand-up spot on ''Letterman .'' l always kind of, uh , want to not do the typical -- Okay, someone's doing something , they go on Tv -- ''Here l am , and here it is. Here's the thing that l'm doing .'' lt's interesting as can be, because that's what comedians -- that's what we used to do. You remember when Johnny didn't call you over? - Yeah . Yes. - Were you upset? l was upset once, when it was like my third or fourth time, and Johnny still didn't -- No, you got called over very quickly, l remember. No. lt was the seventh time. - Really? - Yeah . l never forget. Well , whatever it was, it was sooner than me. - No? - Yeah . Definitely. That would make me feel good , to be frank, but l don't think that's true. l do. l know it's true. l've never wanted a man's approval before then -- before Johnny. [ Mid-tempo jazz plays ''My Favorite Things'' ] [ Music continues ] Yeah , it's a different show, but it's the same theater, same stage. lt's incredible that l can walk out on that same stage and do what these guys did . l was talking about you the other night. Chris Rock was here talking to a friend of mine. But l said , ''The last fucking funny comedian that l ever heard was Seinfeld .'' [ Laughs ] Thank you . - How you doing? - Good . - Good . - Nice to meet you . All right. [ Music continues ] [ Music continues ] MAN : How you doing? Hi .

[ Laughter ] Everybody says to me, ''Hey, you don't do the show anymore. What do you do?'' l'll tell you what l do. Nothing . [ Laughter and applause ] Yeah , l know what you're thinking -- ''That sounds pretty good .'' You're thinking , ''l might like to do nothing myself.'' Well , let me tell you -- doing nothing is not as easy as it looks. You have to be careful , because the idea of doing anything , which could easily lead to doing something . . . that would cut into your nothing . . . and that would force me to have to drop everything . [ Laughter and applause ] Thank you . very funny. - lt's great. - Thank you . - Nicely done. - Thank you . lt felt like my first ''Tonight Show.'' Oh , really? That must have been pretty great. ln that l came off stage and l have really no idea what happened . Really? Did l seem normal and comfortable? - Yeah . - Oh , yeah . How strange that life comes to full circle like that. SElNFELD ON TELEvlSlON : We're still looking for ways to put more cheese into a piece of pizza? [ Laughter ] The whole goddamn thing is cheese anyway, but now somebody figured out, ''We will injection-mold the crust with cheese ''so you have a log of cheese surrounding the pool of cheese in the middle!'' [ Laughter and applause ] Pizza Hut has developed something new now. They will actually bake your head into a block of cheese. . . and you just attempt to eat your way out and regain the use of your five senses. l just did things that l wouldn't normally do -- little line -- little words that. . . You know, l just totally focused on the little, tiny mistakes that l made. l got 30 phone calls, though , which is, like, l think the most l ever had in my life for anything . With my HBO special , which was a hundred times more difficult to do, l got three calls. [ Laughter ] l don't know. l guess it's just my nature. l just. . . lt's just never good enough .

Say hello. This is Gladys Rodgers. - Just say hello. - Hello. Gladys? - Okay. That's enough . - [ Laughs ] l still have all those albums. And it's just -- You can't believe that life could be long enough that you could ever even know this person . Do you normally do two shows? - Yes. - Really? Yeah , because of the theater. - This is a small size for you? - l would rather do -- l don't know what this is. lt's 26, 2 7. l'd rather do two of these than one in an eight-seater, - You know what l mean? - Yeah . This is a comfortable size. l feel l can put a little bit of this. . . l can stop, l can go over here, l can veer back, l can come around the side. This is normal for you -- a 2 :00 and an 8:00? - Sure, sure, sure. - Really? - Wow. - Sure. l love it. Do you? l . . .l just. . .love it. That is a physical effort -- to do two of those shows in one day. That is quite a physical effort. Two hours and twenty minutes.

[ Laughs ] - Muhammad Ali . . . - [ Laughs ] Willie Mays, Joe Louis. . . and when those guys are saying , ''you know, l played the shit out of my game,'' you say, ''You know, l knocked the shit out of. . . - [ Laughs ] - You know what l mean? l . . .l think it's one of the great moments of. . .of being a performer when you can say, ''You know, l took what l had . . . and l knocked it out of the park.'' And that's what you've done. lt is one of the greatest thrills of my career that l even know you . Thank you . l've already done something , and he reminded me of that, and now, this -- l really just want to do what l love to do, and l want to go where he's gone, you know? l want to be able to explore this thing and maybe find some -- that's what l keep thinking -- that maybe there's something else out there.
