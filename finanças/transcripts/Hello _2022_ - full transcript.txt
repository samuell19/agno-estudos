♪ I've been alone with you inside my mind ♪ ♪ And in my dreams I kiss your lips a thousand times ♪ ♪ I sometimes see you pass outside my door ♪ ♪ Hello, hello ♪ Hello I am so sorry. Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I just could not help but to notice your screen. Isaiah Horford, I sell custom made coffins. Seriously. Oh, absolutely. When it's too late to make a first impression, make a greet final impression. I have heard of custom rims. I have even heard of custom cabinets, but I have never heard of custom coffins, ever. I mean, is there even a market for that? Oh, people are dying to get them. It's a business joke. For instance, this is a Pope John Paul the second coffin. Okay. It's a near exact replica of the simple cypress coffin the Pope was laid to rest in. It's a big ticket item among the Catholics. I moved over a 100 of these units last quarter alone. Congratulations. Thank you. Never underestimate person's desire to feel special, even in death. That's why all of our coffins are custom designed and hand built. So what do you do, Miss? Alicia, Alicia Gregory. Actually, I'm a flight attendant. See, there's a strong possibility you may need one of these. I mean, we're all going to die. Sorry, that didn't sound right. What do you say you give me your email and I'll send you a brochure. For the coffins? Yeah. Sure. - Yeah? - Yeah, sure. But can you just excuse me for a moment? Oh yeah, no problem. No problem. You don't even have to get up. Just stay right there. You sure? Yes. I'm positive, stay right there. I'm gonna shimmy on out. You have got to be kidding. Alicia, cool. I'm starting breakfast service. I'm not working. I am a passenger. Okay. Don't go exorcist on me. You are a flight attendant and my roommate, and I need your help. Why did you sit me next to that man right there? What's the problem? He's in first class. So I'm sure he's making decent money and he's not wearing a wedding ring. He sells coffins for a living. Exactly. At least you know he's got a job. No, no, no, no, no. You not hearing what I said. I said the man sells custom made coffins for a living. Okay. Okay. How many times do we have to go for this? Nobody, nobody is perfect. I don't need him to be perfect. Okay. And I'm not even knocking the man's job, I'm not. But he sells coffins. Do you know what's amazing about dumb people? What? Are we taking a poll? Look, they don't even know that they're dumb. Right? Nicole, don't hook me up with anyone else. Please, just don't, stop. Don't. Alicia, we all have bad dates. What's the worst that could happen? I'm not doing this with you. I'm not doing this with you. And what are you over here eating? Oops. Are you high? It is New Year's Eve and I'm working. That's good. Look, what do you want from me? I'm not flying the plane so. No problem. Well, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'd like for you to go get my stuff from my chair and move it to another one or I will kill you. Who's gonna pay the other half of the rent? You didn't think about that, did you? Move my stuff. It's okay, go to the back. Hello. Hello. I'm sorry, did you say something? Hello? Obvious, "Hel-" Yes-My-Yes. I'm sorry. It's my rock bottom song. Rock bottom. Yeah. You know how sometimes in life you feel like life is just bad and it's not gonna get any better. And then suddenly you hear a song and then gives you some hope. Well, "Hello" is my rock bottom song. Yeah, I know that feeling. For me it's Eminem's "Lose Yourself." Okay. "Lose Yourself," I see that. What is that like a battle cry for going hard? I wake up every morning with that attitude. I'm gonna make it happen no matter what. Daniel James. Alicia Gregory. Alicia, you from LA? No, actually Detroit, but my family moved to LA when I was a kid. Yeah. Where are you from? Bay area Monterey. But my mom got remarried and moved to LA. Nice. So are you spending New Year's with your mother? She's having minor surgery at Cedars so I'm flying down for that. Okay. Looks like I'm up. It was really nice meeting you. - You too Alicia? - I'm up, yes. All right, take care. So which "Hello" song am I listening to? What? Well, there are a lot of "Hello" songs. Which song do you think I'm listening to? Well there's Karmin's. Martin Solveig did one, but yours is by Lionel Richie, Motown girl, Detroit. I'm deep from the D exactly. Okay. Okay. Hey. Hi. Excuse me. Excuse me, the beautiful young lady who was here, she's not coming back? She was having some stomach issues. So we moved her closer to the lavatory. Okay. Okay. So you know a little something about me. Well, I'd like to know more. Visiting hours at the hospital are over at seven. What you feel about having dinner with me? A date? Not exactly, but yeah. Well, it's New Year's Eve. I know a place that makes great Mojitos. Yeah. It's still New Year's Eve. You said that. It's new Year's Eve. Yeah. You have plans. And now I feel like an idiot asking, which is a feeling I'd like to go away as soon as possible. I'm sorry. Listen, you have said nothing to make me think you're an idiot. I am actually getting flattered. So dinner isn't a definite no? Yes, It's a no, but you can kinda categorize it in your brain as a maybe, and maybe that'll make you feel better. We are now beginning our descent into Los Angeles. The captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign. So please return to your seats and remain seated until we land. A flight attendant will be around momentarily to collect any last minute items you may like to discard. Well, if you change your mind, here's my number. Is something wrong? Do you always walk around with your number on a napkin? You've never seen a business card like this. They're very popular in clubs, restrooms, on planes. Okay. We'll see. I see you found yourself a little in-flight entertainment. His name is Daniel James and he's from the Bay area. And he's young. Yes, he is. He asked me on the date. Oh, so where are you guys going? Nowhere. I mean, I told him no. Alicia, he's hot. How did you turn him down? I don't know. I mean, he's white. I've never dated a white guy before. Have you? Yeah. Yes. Latin, Chinese, Jewish, Arab. Look, my nana is likely the UN, it happily accepts all races and nationalities. I'm not doing this with you. You're going to hell. Look, you're not a slave and he's not a slave master. So just let that go. It is New Year's Eve and you don't have any plans. I'm working, you're gonna be home alone. Don't do that to yourself. Just go to dinner with him. Then count down to midnight, have a kiss and then ride him like a rollercoaster. Come on, Alicia. Please live in the moment for once. You know I want to, but I can't live in the moment, girl. That means irresponsible decisions. And that's the old Alicia. Please, please, please, Alicia. Oh, what do you mean please Alicia? What is that mean? You have not been in a relationship that has lasted longer than a week, since Troy. Stop, stop. Don't do that. Okay. Because I've dated. Okay. Kill time conversations with random losers doesn't actually constitute as dating. Whatever, just land the plane. Okay. Actually keep on talking. 'Cause at this point it's just the music. I'm going to do my job. Go head. Go. We ask that you turn off all of your electronic devices, stow your tray tables and bring your seats back to their forward and upright positions. Please be careful as you open the overhead compartments, as things may have shuffled during the course of the flight. My name is Nicole.

But I almost had you for a minute. Oh, absolutely. There was a little second, like a half a second. We were there. It was, it was. Pardon me? Beautiful. Alicia. Thank you. Hey. So you ready for the new year? Ready? Well, it's coming whether I'm ready or not, right? You ain't never lied child. Am I gonna see you at my party tonight? It's really gonna be something. I don't know. I have to run, okay. No, you really gotta think about coming to the party. There're gonna be a lot of nice young guys there your age. Look you know I love you, right? No, I didn't know that, but what does that have to do with anything? It's the guys, the kind of guys that come to your party. I just- - And what kind of guys are those? Police. I worked for the police force for 22 years. They're nice guys. I'm sure they are. Look, just do not feel like you are obligated to invite me. You're not. You don't have to. Okay. I am not gonna complain about the noise. I am used to your noise, okay. Suit yourself. But look, I need a favor.

I don't know. Maybe, why? No reason. That's a little boy answer. Is it possible you wanna usher in the New Year with my beautiful, young neighbor? So I talked to her a couple of times, but she's still on the rebound of some dude she used to see. Well, you might get somewhere if you stop using those lame pickup lines. Women don't go for that nonsense anymore. Yeah, you. Auntie, yes they do. So what is your best line? Let me hear it. I have a bottle of champagne, some crab and some garlic noodle for the table please, merci. Oh, I ain't mad at that. All right auntie I'll see you in a minute.

But just be a woman of your word, whatever, whatever I'm getting the bottle. Yes. Pop. Okay, Miss V. That's good. Yeah. So Daniel, this is your business card, right? Let's see what you're doing. No, you don't need to see what you're doing. Why not? What will it hurt? Let's see. This is Daniel. Hello? Hey, Daniel. Yeah. Hi, this is Alicia Gregory. I'm not sure if you remember who I am. Motown girl, hello? Yes, actually that's me. What's going on? Well, I was wondering if you still didn't really have plans for the evening. Do you wanna get a drink? I mean, if you don't have any plans. Meet me in Angelo's in an hour. You know Angelo's is my favorite spot. Imagine that, I'll see you there then. All right. Yes, yes, yes. She's got a date. I'm going on a date. Nicole, you don't know my life. I'm going on a date. Thank you very much. At least you've got the night off. What's going on? Half dozen, small dinner parties. And we got the one big party at Miss Valentine's. Property management gonna be up your ass if anything goes wrong. Hi, I'm so sorry, but it's New Year's Eve and you've been waiting for your guests for a while now there's a couple that would love to have this table. Oh, oh, okay. Do I need a date to sit at the bar? No, ma'am. Okay, well then I guess they can have my table Thank you. Hey. I'm leaving, okay. You're late. You're over an hour late. I don't need this shit in my life. Are you gonna throw me under the bus without a chance to explain? Explain. There is nothing to explain. I get it, it's fine. You got stuff going on. It's cool. I don't need it. Come on just lemme talk to you. Oh, you wanna talk? You wanna talk now, you should have been here over an hour ago. Can you find us a table? Do not find us a table. Thank you. No thank you 'cause we're not doing this. Where do you get that attitude? Detroit. Right, I forgot. Well, this is L.A. So you can give the tough girl act a rest, okay. Wait. Okay. Let me get this straight. You're over an hour late, but I'm the one being unreasonable? You know what? I do not like being humiliated. Okay. I am sorry. I can explain, please. One. Drink You hungry? I ate. Could you bring us two mojitos, a sampler platter, a couple oyster shooters. Now you're ordering, okay. Look, I know you, I dated guys like you. You Daniel, are what I like to call an asshole You're right, I'm an asshole. But not for the reason you think. Oh really. My mom took a turn for the worst, I got into it. My stepfather and things took longer than I thought, I'm an asshole for not calling or texting, but my phone died and I wanted to change. I wanted to look nice for you. You wanted to look nice for me? Things happen. I really do. How is she? She got a little antsy, had a panic attack. That's terrible. She's all right. I don't see her very often. So when I showed up she was good. You're a good son. I try to be. It's not hard she's my mom I love her. You do know what they say about sons who don't want their mother? They're assholes? Okay. Okay. You got me on that one. That was good. That was cute. This is where we do the thing. If we're both so wonderful, why are we alone on New Year's Eve? Enlighten me. I met a woman, Ayesha. Married? No, but it was a lot like a marriage situation. She had a one year old when we met and I raised her daughter. Oh wow. What's her name? Gisele. Her mom and I were together for seven years. Dare ask what happened? She ruined me. It was over after year two, but I stayed in it for another five because I love Giselle so much. Just going through the motions. That's not a reason to stay in a relationship though. That is true. But you only know what you know when you know. Anyway, mom's married to a cop now. Do you see Gisele, often? I wish, but her mom said I have to meet this cop first and I didn't have a problem meeting him. It's just, she made it like this mandate. Gisele's not my biological daughter, so I don't have any rights. I don't have anybody complain to. My ego got in the way. And I felt like I was asking this cop's permission to see the child I raised. You want another drink? Thank you. I did not graduate from high school. I didn't even know who I was then I met this guy and he was great. Really, really nice guy. I fell for him out the gate, I did. What did he do? Oh, like a little of this, a little of that. Narcotics? Talk about knowing something's wrong, but still doing it anyway, right? We've all been there one time or another. Yeah. Anyway, he and I, we we're going good. Now things are moving fast. And I must say in the midst of all that was going on, he taught me what love is. Been out of nowhere he gets popped by the feds for drug possession eight years. I was at my own. I didn't know what to do. I didn't have anyone to call. I had no education. I was almost lost. Is he still inside? No. No, he died. He was killed by a prison riot. So I guess I should ask this the correct way this time. What is it that you do for a living? Arbitrage. Arbitrage? You know what that is? Kinda like, is that where you sell and buy money? Pretty much. I take advantage of the instability of two or more markets combinations of deals are made to capitalize in the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices. I'm sorry. I'm trying. I have no idea. I have no idea what you just said. Either do I. I'm sorry. You wanna get outta here? I feel like this is the moment where two people that want healthy relationships, I feel like this is the moment that they try to avoid. It's New Year's Eve. No one's looking for a healthy relationship they just looking for a good time. All right, you know what? You're right, you're right. Let's do it. Poppin New Year's party at my spot. Great. Let's do it. Let's commemorate the moment first. All right, let's do it. All right, let's go. Hey, Rigo. It's a police convention in here. Yeah. My neighbors having a New Year's Eve party. So this is what happens when all your friends are cops. I can't imagine that's gonna be any fun. Well tonight's talent night so law enforcement is here in full force. All right. Look, I wanna warn you now. I am doing a little remodeling so my place is really messy. Welcome. You want a drink? What have you got? Let's see what I have. I have some vodka and vodka. I will have vodka. Vodka, it is. This nice little collection of vinyl. Thanks. My ex-boyfriend got me into collecting. So what do you take in your vodka? Ice. Okay. Just ice. It's amazing how quiet it is with that party going on upstairs. Yeah, thank God. Ms. Valentine has this party every year. Every year. How does she know so many cops? Well, she was one for 22 years on the police force, LAPD so that's most likely why. You know I don't like cops, right? Why? Because of Gisele. One of many reasons. What do you think? I think that you and I, Daniel, I think we're gonna have a fabulous night despite them. Plus, I mean, no one really likes cops unless you're getting robbed or killed or something. There you go. Happy new year. Happy new year. That is good. What is in that? It is a vanilla vodka and a pomegranate lemonade. It's like a sweet tart thing I like to do. You like it? Yeah, it's good. Thank you. Do you mind if I just step in my room and change my clothes really fast? Not a problem. I'll watch. I'm joking. Very funny. I'll be just a second. You okay out there? Yeah, just having trouble deciding what color Yeah, my roommate and I have yet to figure out which one we want to go with. I had a roommate once. Couldn't agree on anything, glad those days are over. Yeah, well we're both flight attendants. So we are rarely here at the same time. She actually doesn't even get home until tomorrow. Hi. I would like to live in the moment. Absolutely. But just so you know, I don't go to parties I'm not invited to. Well great because you are invited. Daniel, I'm sorry. I have to tell you something. What's wrong? Did I do something? No, no, you're actually perfect. Then what? Look, I can be really defensive and meeting you it's like fresh air. It's just the song... It's the song Troy played on your first day. Oops, I got carried away. I probably shouldn't have said his name. How are you? Mila, look at you. Steven. So glad you made it. I know it's straight from work. Hey that, you look wonderful. You look like you're ready to bring in new year. My loves to... Oh my gosh, that looks amazing. Excuse me. Of course. Wow. Well that was movie star's entrance and you looking just like Billie Holiday. Great. That's what I was going for. Did you want me to run to Alicia's get the rest of the champagne. Are we outta champagne? Thought of get ahead of the game. You wanna get something more from Alicia than some champagnes? She has to kiss somebody at midnight, right? Chief Collins seems like he's having a good time. I wonder who invited him? Chief of police, he must have been on the list. Thank you for that tall glass of bullshit but I am full. Okay. Auntie, I invited him. Why on earth would you do that? We've been doing all this talking about finding someone. I thought you might need some help getting back out there. I don't need help. And I knew you two used to date. That's exactly why he wasn't invited. Oops, my bad. Who knew? So you want me to go kick him him out? I will. That could be a problem. Thing is how everybody in here works for him, including you. That is true. And he's having a good time, leave him alone. Make sure I ruin that before the evening's over. Auntie behave. This is good. It's really good. But I have to admit it is tarnished my girl next door perception of you. It calls your character into question and this whole innocent thing you've got going on. Why are you doing this? You're a flight attendant and you fly the plane, but you're responsible for the passengers on it. It's not like crack or heroine. It has to impede your judgment in some way, not to mention you have like five cases of champagne, the good stuff, but you didn't offer me any. Again, it goes to character. If you're capable of that, what else are you capable of? Did you hit me? Yeah. As a rule, I don't hit women because my dad used to smack my mom around when I was a kid. Obviously I made an extreme exception here. I used my forearms. So it would land flush to not make a bruise, but you can never really tell. This is not an exact science. No, no bruise. Help, help. I am being patient but you're gonna have to cancel that shit right now. Just relax. Let it melt, swallow. No one can hear you anyway, not with Miss Valentine's party. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna rape me? Seriously? If you recall, we were moments away from the emotional throws of carpet burn, head-banging sex. I have to admit it was tempting. Well, you traipsed out here looking so sexy. I could have married you then and there, but that is not part of the plan. You planned this? You think I didn't. You couldn't have planned this because I met you by accident on the airplane and you were late to the restaurant. So had I left then none of this would even be happening. I was right up the block. See, I had scored major cool points with you on the plane. If I show up on time, it's too good to be true. Conflict breeds passion. I created enough drama to get you angry and drinking. Draw off your judgment story about my mom made you think you could trust me. So your mother isn't in the hospital? My mother died eight years ago I'm not just a bad date, I'm a bad everything. The captain has turned off the seatbelt sign. Please feel free to move about the cabin. Do you think that they'll cancel our next flight because of that storm? One can only hope. If that joker rings his bell one more time I'm going to kill him. I wouldn't go that far. I'll piss in the next drink he orders. I'm surprised there isn't a video out of that by now It could be my film debut. And then you can get the airline sued for millions of dollars to lose your job and end up living alone with a cat. Well, this is an area where I probably want as much cover as possible. Then get somebody else to do it. For real? Look at my face. Hey, hey, this is some kind of joke, right? I mean, okay, for a TV show or something? Running out of items on your, what the hell is going on list? Look, this side of you is not gonna help you get girls. I do all right. Why are you doing this, Daniel? My name isn't Daniel, but for the purposes of our relationship, let's keep that going. This is a nice bag What's it cost? Couple grand? I don't know it was a gift. By the way, what is with all the champagne. I like to party. I bet. Well, let's see what we've got here. Oh, little lady, big gun. What do we have here? Smith & Wesson 38 titanium revolver. Nice, expensive. My roommate gave and sent me for protection. How's that working out for you? Rewind. I'm gonna hang onto this with my own protection. So much better since they improved the camera. Say cheese. No? you know I always wanted to be a photographer. Photographers get all the women. There is almost nothing you can't get a woman to do if you've got a camera in your hands. That could be your new pic for the gram. You know, it's amazing to me, how many women claiming to be into the Lord or whatever, and have half naked pictures of themselves on their pages. I get it. It's not complicated. Women like attention and the regular photos don't get as many likes as the butt naked one. So even the most conservative prudent women will post a pick from the beach wearing a bikini, which is really just a bra and panties. Check out my hot ass that I'm showing you accidentally on purpose. Like me, love me, comment. Tell me I'm hot. They all live. And their little narcissistic side shows laced with a bit of hypocrisy. That's not all women. No, just 99%. Don't get me started on sex tapes. I mean, who loses a video of them riding the high hard one? Maybe we should live stream this. We should. There are a lot of people that are into bondage. The police. Nice try. Anyway, let's get back to the virtuous, Alicia Gregory. You know, it's funny, it's New Year's Eve and you have not gotten one call, not one person wishing you well. No one even ask you out, but me. Should have got a cat. I know much care for cats. More of a dog person, a dog will protect its owner with no rhyme or reason. How long are we gonna do this? Gum, lipstick, makeup remover, Q-tips, lotion, M&Ms. Look you did all of this just to go through my purse? Dramamine, what kind of flight attendant gets motion sickness? You try going up and down 30,000 feet several times a day tell me how you feel? Minus the 30,000 feet sound like a hooker. Most people take terrible pictures on their driver's license. I'm one of them, but this is really good. Look, if it's money that you want, then just take my purse. Okay, you can sell it. I have at least $160 in my wallet and I know I have $200 on my nightstand. I already found the 200 along with this. I guess your nights have been a little lonelier than I thought. I should have kept them that way. Well, all those years watching Cinderella growing up can really throw off a girl's judgment. Why are you doing this you sick fucking bastard? I've been drinking champagne, vodka, smoking weed, drunk and high at the same time, and you're testing my patience Stop it. Good. Oh, I get the munchies. Chief Collins. Miss Valentine. I'm empty, would you be a dear and get me another champagne. This is a police friendly environment and I hate to interrupt your schooling of the younger generation, but we need to talk. Do we have to? My house, my rules. You are killing in that outfit. It's a disguise. Yeah, as what? Someone who invited you to my party. Of course I should be. Is that your solution to everything, running? Well, you should stop being so mad at me. I had just found out I was pregnant by a man who was going through a nasty divorce and whom I happened to work for so excuse me if I needed to clear my head. How do you think I felt going through it while being suspended for fraternizing with a subordinate officer. I thought Linda was a friend I had no idea she'd tell the world. She was a bullhorn and you knew it. You think I told her to hurt your career? Think you told her to hurt me. Thank you, sweetheart. I dig this cranberry tuna, costs about $20 a quart. Must be nice to afford this small luxuries in life. Of course women will buy anything they think will help 'em lose weight, tuna juice, salad, whatever. It is amazing that a group of women have not beat your ass yet. Many have tried it yet here I am. I've got something you want, your life and freedom. You've got something I want. I'm your host, you're the hostage, let's play our game. Where are the diamonds? Huh? Where are the diamonds? What are you talking about? Where are the diamonds? I have no idea what you're talking about. I was in prison with your boyfriend, Troy Nelson. Well, if this has anything to do with Troy, then I don't know what you're talking about. Look, Troy's dead, okay? And before that he was in prison for three years. Yes, a real loss to the planet earth. But before Soul Train met his demise- - Who the hell is Soul Train? Troy Nelson also known as Soul Train. And it's not because he could dance it's because he was black and had a prosperous career as a drug dealer, shuttling product from Mexico to LA. I already told you, Troy was a drug dealer. Let's keep that circle of truth going. And you can start by telling me where the 2.7 million dollars in diamonds that Troy Nelson was paid for his final transaction in pharmaceutical distribution. $2 Million in diamonds? Don't act surprised. You think that I have $2 million, but you don't want me to act surprised. 2.7 million and do not act like you don't know what I'm talking about. I have done a careful search. I've tried not to break anything, but I have not found the diamonds. I'm sure you haven't and you will not find them because they are not here. Listen, I would help you, okay if I could, but I can't. I have not seen or spoken to Troy since he went to prison. Oh, there goes our circle of truth. You're being naive at best, and disingenuous at the very worse. Did you just call me a dumb liar? Yeah. I hope you rot on your way to hell. Okay. If you haven't seen Troy, since he got locked up explain these. They're letters. He wrote me. I didn't write him. That's kind of stupid to keep writing someone who isn't writing back. Even for a convict. I told you I cared about him. Well, that's not what you said at the restaurant. I was drinking, but I wasn't so far gone that I don't remember you saying you loved him. I wasn't- - He was a real nice guy. Lots of money, great lifestyle. Y'all did a lot of stuff together. I know what I said. And why lie about it now? Look, Troy was my man, okay. He was good to me and he helped me. I was just trying to respect his memory. I admire your courage, if not your loyalty, but if you don't want to die, you need to tell me the truth. "Dear, honey." That would be you. Stop, I know what the letter says. I am sure you do, but I don't. "It's tough in here, babe." I guess he should have thought of that before he became a drug dealer, but Troy was not particularly bright, was he? Really, moral superiority coming from a man who was also in prison? "You're the first thing I think of every morning and the last thing I think of at night." But how much did you think about him when there was another guy up in here giving you the high hard one? I never cheated on Troy. Not once. Not once. Unless you count our little battery operated friend. Okay, here we go. "Thanks for the money you put on my books." Be careful how much you send. I don't want people to get suspicious. "Love always, Troy." People get suspicious. I wonder what he meant by that. He didn't want me putting too much money on his books because they would apply it to the cost of his trial. Why would you think you have too much money? I mean, I don't even think Jeff Bezos thinks there's such thing as too much money. And even if there was, where did you get it? I work. Look, it was tight at times. Yes, but I figured it out. Look, I didn't visit him. And it was the guilt. But see, that's something that you obviously know nothing about considering you let your ego keep you away from your so-called daughter, Gisele. You make a great candidate for a talk show host. But maybe, I'm thinking now maybe there is no daughter. Maybe there is no Gisele. Maybe you lied about that. Yeah, you lied about your name. You lied about your mother. So maybe that's it. Maybe it's all a lie because I cannot imagine if you really did raise this daughter, how you could be doing this to a woman. You don't get to talk about Gisele. I'm not talking about Gisele I'm talking about you. See if my man raised my daughter the way you say you raised her, kind and gentle- - Shut your mouth. Okay. Got it. You aren't gentle. You aren't kind, you weren't none of those things. You are a junkie. You're an alcoholic. Is that it? Is that why Ayesha left you. She was afraid of you. She most likely went to the cop to protect herself from you, to protect Gisele from you. She was scared of you. I feel like I'm getting somewhere closer now. I mean, you know so much about my life, Daniel. Why not, tell me please. My name is not Daniel. I know it's not Daniel. And you're would you say a marriage type of situation? Is that what it was? You got a gang of words coming outta your mouth, but you're not saying a thing. Why is it always the man's fault? It's the easiest thing in the world for a woman to blame a man for her overwhelmingly dimwitted decisions, maybe Ayesha was so disgusted with what she did in our relationship, she couldn't look herself in the mirror and so she ran into a cop 'cause that was the closest thing to right. Like the whore who became a bible thumping, doorbell ringing fanatic, after she got gang-banged by the varsity football team. As if going into a room of drunk horny teenage boys to strip for money wasn't a sign that something bad might happen. Or maybe she was a born again idiot, too stupid to graduate from high school, didn't know who she is, going with the flow, living in the moment, which all of a sudden makes dating a drug dealer something cool to do. Dixie cup size of peach cobbler Great job. Always leave them beggin for more What are you doing? Sorry? Where are you going? I've done an adequate amount of glad-handing, and I know you don't want me here, so I'm leaving to avoid any embarrassment. No you're not. Auntie. Steven. Pardon me. We are almost outta champagne. Did you drink all of it? Try as I might. I cannot not. Are you drunk? Buzzed, flying to just the right speed. Okay. Go find a hand truck and get the rest of the champagne from Alicia's. I'll handle it. Do you like movies? I like movies. I especially like scary movies I know none of it's real, but what I enjoy about them is that they could be real. It could happen. And the reason we believe it could happen is because these movies have something called the ring of truth. Now you're talking, but everything you're saying lacks the ring of truth. For instance, if I had your social security number and I do, I could check your credit online and see that you haven't missed a payment on your loft in six years, you've got a credit rating of 790, but I'm sure you already knew that. Troy bought this place, but the mortgage isn't cheap. The flight attendant salaries based on a number of things, education, years of experience, location. So on and so forth. You bring in $76,531 a year, that's before taxes. So let's knock that down to 55 after the government takes their cut. The mortgage on this place is five grand a month. That's 60 a year. You're upside down five stacks and that's before I've added your car note, wifi, food, designer handbags. You know what I think? I don't care what you think. You better, honey, 'cause your life depends on it. You've been selling the diamonds piece meal. What? Well, one here, one there. Losing the gap between what you make, what you owe. You're insane. Look, if I had $2 million I would not have a roommate. She pays half of my rent that gives me just enough money to then buy food and pay my wifi and pay my car note. And my purse by the way, it was a gift from a pilot that I work with. Well you just have a clever answer for everything. Yeah, well you know it's not hard when the person you're talking to is not as smart as they think they are. You know what I do know, every deep, dark secret you've ever pondered because your idiot boyfriend told them to me. I know about your crossdressing brother, your alcoholic mother, her boyfriend, Moses who molested you until you were 16 ran away from Detroit that you turned tricks for hot meals in LA until Troy found you, and I know about the fucking diamonds. You don't know shit. It is not important... It is not important that you believe me, Alicia throughout this, I have been kind, polite, but I am done playing with you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, listen, listen. I promise, I promise, I promise. Perky little buttons and they are real too. I've never been a breast man So this is gonna be easy for me. For you however- - Please, please, please, I promise to find those diamonds. Don't say a fucking word or I'll kill him How are you doing? Can I help you? Yes, is Alicia home? Yeah, but she's in the shower. Oh and you are? I'm Daniel. Oh, well I'm her neighbor. Ms. Valentine's nephew, Steven. She's the one throwing the party upstairs. Oh yeah, one with all the policemen, right? You a cop too? I am. She throws these things every year. Apologize there's too much noise. Oh, it's no problem. We can barely hear it. Good. So you two are dating? I'm not really into labels. Well then can you tell me when Alicia will be outta the shower? I don't know. What's going on? Well, we stored some champagne here for the party. It is your champagne. Of course it is. I mean, unless Alicia's becoming an alcoholic. Let me grab that for you. I'll help you. No, no, no. I hope you're not mad at us. Why would I be mad? We drink a couple bottles of your champagne. I should hit you in the face. No, I'm sorry. I can pay for 'em if you like. Forget it. I'm just joking. Consider a New Year's Eve gift. Thank you. So how long you've been a cop? 12 Years and counting. Hold one second. It's my aunt she's wondering what's taking me so long. I should be out. Nice to meet you, Daniel. Yeah, for sure. And I will tell Alicia you stopped by. Before I forget, happy new year. Happy new year. Is my shit together or is my shit together? It's new Year's you should stay. So why did your nephew become a police officer? You'd have to ask him. But as far as I know, it was to be in the family business. Well his mother and father are doctor and a lawyer. How does that track? His grandfather was in law enforcement and so was his aunt. He not just making that up? No. He's not my son? No. You know he'd be about the right age. Yeah. How do I know you're telling me the truth? Because I lost your child. You what? I lost your baby. But you took maternity leave? I took a leave of absence, but it wasn't to have a baby. You lost the baby? Two weeks after you got suspended. I am so sorry. But you didn't say anything. To who? The only person I trusted ran her mouth and got you suspended. I couldn't risk it. But you did take leave? Yes. I don't understand. I needed time. Time for what? Time to get over you. I lost the baby of the man I loved more than air and I couldn't face you. So I left 'cause I needed time to get over you but it didn't work. It didn't? No, I know we were forever ago, but you had me and you still got me and I hate it. I never knew. You know we were good together. You were the best thing that ever happened to me. And there hasn't been communication this bad since the Cuban missile crisis. Well, we can try to make up for it if you want to. I want to, I want to very badly. It'll be the first time with this guy and I don't wanna come off as a slut. There are exceptions to the slut rule. Is New Year's Eve one? Yeah and birthdays and Christmas and Valentine's day. Basically anytime it's a gift. And Halloween, when you can just hook up. This a final boarding call to flight A47. Does the new year officially start at 12 midnight? Or is there grace period until sunrise? Wait what'd you just say? Just sort of left brain sex joke. I don't have anything of value to add to this. Due to bad weather all flights going to Chicago have been canceled this evening. Let's get outta here before they uncancel our flight. That's not how it works. I see you got the champagne. Mission accomplished. Couldn't convince Alicia to come? I didn't even see her, she has a guy over there. I am glad everyone's having such a good time. And we are just getting started. So put your hands together for Dave. Stupid bitch, are you out of your fucking mind? Didn't your parents teach you not to play with fire? You are really, really testing my patience. If you think I'm just gonna sit here every chance I get, I'm going for mine. It's security, isn't it? Answer me, it's building security. The smoke alarm is connected to the building security system. Otherwise they would've called your phone. Happy new year. Hi. Sorry to disturb you but this is Rigo Hernandez in security. Yeah. Rigo, the smoke alarm. We were trying to get a jumpstart on New Year's dinner and I'm just for shit when it comes to cooking. Is Ms. Gregory or Davenport there? Yeah, Alicia's in the kitchen. May I speak with her? Yeah, sure, Rigo. Babe. I have a confession to make, I don't know shit about books or arbitrage or fancy restaurants, but I know a dozen ways to kill a man. So if Rigo, the security guard comes up here to investigate the fire alarm I will cut his ass every which way but loose. Do you understand? Say it. I understand. Start talking and make it good. Hello. Ms. Gregory. Hi. Hi, this is Rigo Hernandez in security. You sound out breath. Yeah, I'm sorry. I was making barbecue in the kitchen. I got something on my hand. That's why I didn't answer the phone. We're fine. I'm fine. That's good to hear. Oh and by the way, what's your code word? Diamonds. Okay. That's all I need from you Ms. Gregory. Happy new year. Happy new year. That was magnificent. I cannot tell you how happy that just made me. It almost makes me forgive you for lying about the champagne. I especially like your code word. The voicemail box you reached is full. Please hang up and try again. The long day and a long night. It is almost new year but before that happens, you are going to tell me where the diamonds are. I've gotta pee. I don't care. You have been playing games with me all night and playtime is over. Please let me go to the bathroom, please. Look, if you let me use the bathroom, then I will tell you whatever it is you wanna know. No, no, no, no So would it be too much to ask for just a little bit of privacy, please? Really? I mean, you've been all talk, the silent treatment. Well it's fine, but it's gonna take a while. I mean, it took me months to tinkle in front of my boyfriend and you are a stranger who's holding me hostage. So just wait. Look, it didn't have to be this way. Okay, I wonder if circumstances were different and you weren't convinced that I had these diamonds, I wonder what could have happened. How many times do I have... I do not know- - Shut up. I'm hip to your game. I'm hip. You scare the shit out of me and then reprieve. That's your get down. Amazing, the plan didn't work. What are you now? An ice man. Cold and silent. Trying to be scarier. Play time is over sweetheart. You're the dumb girlfriend, but you're not the dumb girlfriend. You know what I'm saying? Are you trying to be scarier? And it's not a threat. It's a promise. I'm on a clock. If you don't tell me where those diamonds are- - Then what? Huh? What you gonna do? You gonna shoot me? Right between those pretty brown eyes. No you not. You not because if you do, I can't tell you where the diamonds are and you can't scare me enough into telling you. So we have a problem. Thank you for admitting you know where the diamonds are. I didn't admit shit, but I do know who you are. You know what I told you? Nah, I know who you are. Troy wrote me about you in his letters. Bitch ass CO, scared of all the cons. They made you their errand boy. Is that right? Would you say different? Candy for em and phones and drugs whatever they wanted. Huh? So they stay off your ass. You're outta your mind. Who's running from the truth now? Blood stains on the prison church floor, your coward ass high inside of a confessional. That's why my man is dead you couldn't kill shit. Can't even kill time. There are worse things than death. But you have to be afraid to die for them. I'm not scared. Not scared to die. I'm not scared of you, but I really don't have to be do I? Oh, smart. Now let me go. Untie me. I'll forget this shit ever happened. There is something Troy didn't write you in his letters because he was dead. I'm the one who killed him. Now you are going to experience the worst that can happen. Get off of me. Get off of me. Okay, everybody. Here we go. 10, nine. Six, five. No, no, no. Two, one. Get off of me. Nicole, Nicole run. Run Nicole. Is he dead? Yeah. Yeah. I think so. This is a thing. Wait, why are you here? How did you- - There's a storm in Chicago and the flight got canceled. I tried to call a couple times. We should call the cops. He's a cop. What? Yeah, he's the CO. He used to work at Troy's prison. Shit. Yes. Shit. We should still call them. I know, I know. I know. I need a second. I need a second, Nicole. Right yeah. You should put some clothes on. I need a drink. You okay? No. This was not your fault, Alicia. I don't even know what this was. Look, the world is full of crazy people. But he wasn't crazy. Excuse me. No, he wasn't crazy. Nicole, he was a thief. He tried to rape and kill you. Yes but he thought that I had something that he wanted. What did he think you had? Two million dollars in diamonds. Alicia, two million dollars in diamonds. I know. Well, you know you don't have that. Exactly. I'm sorry. We need to call the police, okay? Yeah, just gimme a minute, okay? Okay. Alicia? Yeah, I can't come out there. It's okay. He's still covered up. He's right there. Okay Alicia, I need you to get yourself in a mental space where you can explain to the police what happened here? You want something to drink first? Yeah please. All right. Here you go. You can leave it on the table. I think we should talk before we call the police to figure out what we're telling them. Have I done something to you that makes you think that I'm dumb? What are you talking about. Earlier today when we were on the airplane I remember you saying that, dumb people don't know that they're dumb. So I'm trying to figure out what have I done that makes you think I'm dumb. I don't actually think you're dumb, Alicia. Why? Nicole, you're my best friend. Shit, the money. Why else? So you set me up. Yes. Yes, Alicia I did. But I let you live with me. Compared to the millions of dollars in diamonds, bitch, come on. Okay. So this entire time you have just been faking like you my friend for diamonds. Oh, well that was Michael's or Daniel, whoever he was that was his idea. But then when I couldn't find them, he wanted to take matters into his own hands. No, that doesn't make sense because then why would you kill him? Well, this path serves me right. A 100% is better than 50%, right? Yeah. Where are the diamonds? They're in the living room. Well, let's go to the living room. You know, you should be ashamed of yourself. And nobody should be allowed to make red bottoms, but Christian Louboutin. It's behind the painting. Okay. Open it. No, no, no. I mean, in case you have a pistol next to the diamonds, you know. You know what I think? I don't know. I don't care, actually nobody does. I think you always planned on killing Daniel. Yeah. And not because you didn't want to split the diamonds with him. Oh, that's the thing. I didn't kill Daniel, you did. You wanted him dead so that you can pin my murder on him. You bitch. What happened? Well, the detective said your neighbor, Alicia went on a date with a guy. Once she told the guy she didn't want to sleep with him, he went crazy. Tied her up, was about to rape her until the roommate, Nicole, came home and saved her. Unfortunately, Nicole and the assailant were killed in the process. I was in there. I could have stopped him. The things men do to women. I've gotta see Alicia. Hold your horses. She's not in there. What do you mean? She's pretty frazzled, and rightly so.
