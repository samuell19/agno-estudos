Karl... Karl, come to me I want to see the nonsense these fools are up to Yet you're not interested in anything I do They are doing the horse test What did you say? Nothing - What test did you say? - Of the horse A young boy and a horse, both virgins They hope to find a vampire's tomb The blood is fresh! Can you fill this with his blood for me There's an order not to touch the corpse I'll collect it at dawn Irina, Irina! - Coming! - My lady is waiting Why are you here? You know I don't like visits Sorry It's bread against vampires Irina got blood of the one they staked yesterday She promised to give me a piece Did you do three crosses before kneading? Smear your fingers with ash? - No, I thought... - Go on, get out! You'd get nothing right if it wasn't for me You, get the ashes Get off me you idiot Marina, you don't have to be like this Let's see what my father thinks Fran, the magistrate's luggage, quickly! How far is the town of Cajlice? You're going to Cajlice? It's 4 hours by horse Best you leave tomorrow at dawn It will soon be night And there is much talk of vampires and ghosts It's for the trial of a vampire that I go there I would like to know some background I can give you the background, Helsing You are Helsing, the magistrate? Senor Marquis, I welcome you to my humble house I bet you have some good wine hidden away, you rogue Yes, of course sir You must be Karl Ziemmer, master of Cajlice I guess I must ask you to what I owe the honor To boredom I'm bored by Cajlice and its louts I jump at any chance to meet interesting guests Thank you, but I'm not sure if that's me I have ordered my carriage to meet us tomorrow at dawn I hope I'm not wrong Take the magistrate's bags to his room and prepare one for me - I'll not need that horse now - As you wish, sir What you will need is much patience to handle those vampires They smell very bad, I assure you I'm getting old, nurse How could you ever be old My skin is no longer as white as before Time passes for all of us, even the rich and the powerful It can only be beaten by taking risks And it takes much courage to go down the dark roads that the occult offers us It is much easier to accept that death, little by little, takes us over But to live, you need to take risks What sort of risks? You know in your family there was another Erzebeth? - She bathed in the blood of virgins - Yes, I know Nobody wants to talk of that story But it's true - Was she beautiful? - So they say Among the most beautiful ever But her beauty was useless, as she lived alone in her castle Her husband stayed in the royal court - I also live alone - You have Karl No, not anymore. He is with me, but he is not mine He prefers his hawks How they kill and destroy their prey I am alone Maybe forever now You can get him back if you want Remember the other Erzebeth Yes? Come in My father said to bring you a new pillow Thank you Good night, sleep well You too Good night, daughter Good night, father What makes you tremble, Marina? - Shut up, you bitch - Bring more wine, my pigeon Don't try to fool this old woman What do you need? A love potion? Do you need it to snare this marquis? Or does that color mean you don't you need it anymore? I don't need a potion Not for the marquis or any other man It's my husband will show me the secrets of love It's better to learn from a passing marquis with a full purse Plenty of time to get bored by a peasant with no grace or fortune If I had your youth... he'd not leave without me knowing his refined caresses You won't easily find such a man again, Marina, believe me When we get old, we never regret what we have done, only what was within our reach that we didn't do You are the Devil in person Oh, yes Rub your hands together with this mixture And get close to him on any pretext He will be yours forever What do I owe you? Nothing I'm just happy that you do what I want to do but cannot - Sir? - What is it? Come in - I forgot to bring your water - Thanks, put it there Shall I help you? What's your name? Marina, sir Has your father told you to do this? No, this was my idea, my parents are asleep You are very pretty, Marina - You really think so? - Yes, you are - See you soon, you rogue - Thank you, sir Did you go with that man? Stay away from him, pigeon He brings death with him - But last night you said - I'd not seen his eyes last night They are the Devil's eyes Get back! Gentlemen, gentlemen...! I beg your attention and silence Mr. Secretary, read the charges against Peter Plojovitz and the accusations of vampirism this court must judge if I may... Peter Plojovitz, do you confess to having practiced vampirism, abused your medical practice and violated natural laws? Proceed to the interrogation of witnesses I don't understand this trial, madam. Do they need more proof? Those visits he made to people after death And the smell... The vampire smell is unmistakable And in the grave, when he was staked, he gave a terrible cry - Stupid girl - I'm sorry, ma'am Get me a cloth No, a linen one You never do anything right Cheer up, friend Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth? Yes, I do And I swear that Dr. Plojovitz is a vampire Until they burn his head and throw the ashes in the river, we'll not sleep easy in this town Save your opinions and give us the facts How long must we listen to this fool? Maybe he was buried alive for fear of spreading the plague? - Did anyone here certify his death? - Silence! Doctor, I beg you for restraint He is a witness and as such, must be heard In due course we will discuss the statements The witness may step down There's a stain The skin has become lighter I told you, the doctor knew the medallion was mine and asked for it I gave it to him without asking anything in return Along with a parchment in a language I don't know And I warned him... telling him clearly of the danger What danger is that? All who have worn that medallion, before a year is out, have died an unnatural death So how come you are still alive? I never wore it It's not right to tempt fate Remember this, and I hope I am wrong, this will not be the last victim of that cursed medallion There's no trace of it left It was just a small mark Maybe you imagined it My skin was turned white by Irina's blood She, like the beautiful Erzebeth, knows how to use blood The other day, I saw her rub dove's blood on her breasts Fetch her Maria Vasari, widow of Peter Plojovitz Are you the wife of Dr. Peter Plojovitz? I am his widow, Your Honor - You recognize this corpse? - We know it's him We don't want to make this situation any worse that it needs be But this is necessary Do you recognize the corpse of your husband, the accused? Please madam, calm down Do you recognize this corpse as that of your late husband? The devil! Nadja Plojovitz 2 days after visiting me, he came to Nadja And what did he do? He looked at me with a strange sadness And what then? He gave me a long kiss But not like I was his daughter - And then... - And then what? He bit me hard on the neck And began to suck blood from the wound! Your own daughter, damn you. Your daughter! She won't be safe until we finish him I ask for justice ls there no mercy for a poor innocent girl? What more proof do you need? You think this could attract new victims? Do you feel any strange sense of mystery? - I beg you, Marquis, no jokes - I'm not joking You talk of evidence, we should test if what they say is true Fine, but how? I shall keep the medallion, wear it, and if it's true that I risk dying within a year, I accept that risk It's not wise to tempt the Devil The Marquis offers us the chance of uprooting a superstition Why should we stop him? Let's talk further in my castle This place is rather gloomy, don't you think? Excellent meat, madam I think the judge and the mayor made a serious mistake declining the Marquis' invitation Your Honor, I know this is a delicate subject, but I must ask you a question I'm at your service ls a vampire a creature that has managed to cheat death? And if so, is it due to the blood of its victims? Sorry, I interrupted you And I know that you want to answer my wife We know the death of some beings, feeds the life of others We see this every day in nature Even ourselves, we feed on the death of plants and animals In the case of the vampire, perhaps he's just a rebel Not resigned to leave this world A world he knows and understands Indeed And as Voltaire wrote: Those who suck human blood are not the dead, but the living: Speculators, usurers, those real life vampires who don't live in cemeteries, but in luxurious palaces - Like this one? - More or less, Excellency Do you like rubies? The red stones repel vampires You believe those stories about the walking dead? We should respect tradition, doctor One day science may explain many things that today are seen as just simple superstitions Then I will be happy to change my mind I see my music has done its work - Fine music - Thank you, but it's not mine I'm sorry I kept you up, but I have arranged everything here, and hope you will be my guests Thank you Who's there? Who is it? What are you doing here? Answer me Forgive us, sir The mistress told us, well, she told me... Inge is a friend May she stay with me tonight in the palace? What have you got there? The blood of a dove, it firms the breasts Take that - And don't come up here again - No sir Now go Go on... get out Swing it from right to left Extraordinary events are coming Go on, my little one It's time to start the ceremony Now that we have confirmed the guilt of the accused, I ask representatives of the forces of order, to announce the procedure to be used for execution of the sentence passed With a dissenting vote from Dr. Silas We follow the Olmutz Consistory Cut off the defendant's head, burn it and scatter the ashes Carry out the sentence. Take him away Nothing It was a dove in heat It should be virgin's blood Last time there was a white stain where the blood fell The last time it was Irina's blood The blood of a living woman The corpse can be burned in the coffin I must throw the ashes of the head into the river Or I will never rest easy As you wish You must close the house, along with your husband's belongings It's the law How shall we live? I have no fortune Maybe the town can make you a small loan against the land If, after two years someone wants to buy the land... Madame... No one will buy cursed land You should still find those title deeds Without those, the municipality will not take the risk Nadja... Yes, mother? Search your father's papers for the deeds of the property Who are you? Come in Come closer I'm sorry, I thought that... ls this the parchment Carmilla gave your father? Don't touch it, sir Don't touch it, I beg you. It's cursed Did you love your father very much? Yes And this wound? Are you sure you didn't do it like this... while you were asleep? Please leave me, sir. I beg you Leave me Death to the vampire! Your servant, madam Have a good trip, Helsing And you, Karl, good hunting Those companions will be more exciting than lawyers We all have our moments See you soon, Helsing. At the next trial You are incorrigible, Karl. See you soon My lady See you later, my dear Have fun Stay away, ma'am These are the vampire's ashes You stay away, this is my land But we must throw the ashes in the river, ma'am Use the other road Laura, come here Her mother is sick, my lady She left her with me, I'm sorry I'll make sure she does no harm I told you not to come in here - You can't catch me! - Laura! Stop it Child, stop that Leave her, she's so funny Excuse her, she's only ever lived with poor people - Would you like a present? - Yes Well, hello... Have you already had a snack? Or don't you like cake? No? Come, let's find your present Where is it? Let's go see - What is it? - Something nice - You like? - Yes Take it What's this doll called? Blanca... Nurse! Nurse! - Don't cry - What is it, ma'am? Who left broken glass there? It's nothing, don't cry Give her some coins to buy a dress with I want to go home! I want my mama The main thing is, the test worked I don't think so Now we know a solution exists - But we also know it's impossible - Why? How can you ask that? - How is it possible to get...? - The other Erzebeth did it Why should you fail? You just need to overcome your scruples And with that I can help you a lot - If only it were possible - But it is The other day, I caught a lizard and said to myself: Why not prepare a magical potion that can raise passion And you think that Karl...? If you obey me, Karl will be like a defenseless bird in your hands Oh great spirit... Oh mighty Adonai... Oh great spirit... Oh mighty Adonai... Transfer the virtues of this unclean reptile... Transfer the virtues of this unclean reptile... Cunning, power, fascination... Cunning, power, fascination... into this submissive servant So be it So be it Filthy vampire! - The Marquis is dead - What happened? I don't know, he died suddenly I think The servants say he was playing music then suddenly stopped God rest his soul I still remember his mocking air when he bought that vampire stuff I hope this serves as an example for unbelievers Who is it? What do you want? Nadja Your wages Thank you Tell the mistress I am sad to leave her - But I understand her reasons - I'll tell her Don't be a hypocrite, you're happy to be fired You've never seen so much money Shut up, you fool I'd gladly forgo pay to stay with the Marquise What will become of her? Never pity the rich, Irina She'll close the palace and go to the city, or her castle by the sea She'll forget the Marquis, you, me and the morning light Take your money, and stop your sermons Don't insult the mistress's kindness Look, there at the bedroom window What? It was him, I'm sure I saw him - Saw who? - The Marquis Come on, Irina, enough of your witch tales Come on, I have to be home before sunset Take the coach so they won't see us arrive together - I need strong drink, friend - What's the news? In Cajlice they are still having problems with the dead The Marquis who died a few days ago, they say he shows up at night - Two girls have died already - Come inside and tell me Hey, did you hear? Marina where are you going? Hey Marina! Hear what they say about your beloved Marquis? Idiot - What are you painting? - Crosses against vampires Plojovitz's daughter disappeared They found Sandra's carriage and no sign of her People are scared This is wood from the Black Forest One sharp blow is enough I was going to look for you in the palace - What is it? - Bad things are happening The other day, leaving the palace, I saw the Marquis in the window That's impossible, we all saw the Marquis dead You must leave the palace, and tell the mistress also Who knows what might pass? Since the Marquis died, strange things have happened You know he walked around the palace with that medallion from Plojovitz You can come to my house if you want - I don't know what to think - That place is cursed There'|| soon be more deaths like the Marquis We'll get an olive branch blessed for Easter and nail it over the cross on the door It's the third house after the well I still have bread made with vampire's blood, if you want protection I can't leave the mistress alone But maybe I can convince her... to go to the city To court, with her cousin, the lnfanta - Go with God - May the Virgin protect us Inge, what's wrong? Didn't you hear it? No... I must have been dreaming Your damned stories... I keep seeing vampires everywhere - You want me to stay with you? - No It's best I get over it It'll pass. Don't worry about me Get some sleep Sir, I'm just a poor village girl Inge! Inge! Don't be afraid, Erzebeth You don't fear death, just old age Yet the youthfulness under your smooth skin fears nothing and your life can be gone just like that, in a split second Let me go! I can't believe it... Irina Valerius? But don't you realize this is a macabre joke - a crime? A sacrilegious crime, or maybe revenge? Perhaps so, but the other girls? Nadja, Sandra, even Inge, found dead in her home The people are not looking for rational explanations There are those who claim to have seen the late Marquis It was Irina who saw him That day we were fired from the palace No one believed her, but now... Erzebeth? Erzebeth...? What's going on, little one? Nurse... Someone was there, next to the mirror Come, come, little one, I've locked all the doors There's no-one, calm down - It was Irina - No... I saw her, I'm sure Don't leave me alone They've come for me They stalk me They want their blood back That cursed blood that only slid off my skin Those deaths, they weigh heavy on me It's not long, little one, we leave at dawn Leon will come for us with the carriage and we'll go far from here where they'll never find us I wish I'd never listened to you The Devil has entered this house through your damned spells He'll always follow us And he'll never leave us, never... Who's there? Who is it? Take off my boots, Marina Why are you waiting? Take off my boots Suppose I scream and the servants come I know that you are different Different? It's useless, Marina, you can't hurt me Shall I try? My father can hear us Here I am Come Put on these jewels, rubies, tourmalines, garnets, blood stones No evil spirit can harm you now Good morning, madam - We heard you were leaving - You heard right I ask you to postpone this journey We await the arrival of the notary to exhume the corpse of the Marquis On whose authority? It's my duty to maintain public order What if I still undertake this journey? I would have to use force We have nothing against you Rather we are trying to protect you Please understand, we need your collaboration If you don't wish to attend the ceremony, no one will force you You are free We understand your situation But you must understand we need to open the crypt and the coffin I forgive you on account of your ignorance The power you've been given exceeds your ability and you have no respect for a lonely woman You force me to stay, but don't expect any help Come, let's go My God... Don't fear, little one. you've done nothing They know that Remember the widow Plojovitz All the weight of justice will fall on Karl Wake up, Karl Wake up, come on You haven't changed your mind? Of course not I'll take you with me if you want However... Are you sure you won't miss all this? Miss it? I never liked my life here I hate serving people Only you can give me what I want - Such as? - I don't know... All my life I've wanted beautiful clothes Jewels, servants Many servants who will bow before me People to wash my clothes, to comb my hair And not just that, of course We can love each other freely, and not like here, secretly... in this miserable bed, between these poor, rough sheets But what's wrong? Nothing - I understand... Your wife... - No My wife no longer counts in my life You will have what you want Everything you deserve, I promise Trust me Tonight they will have fun like never before It's a shame we can't watch the show - Have you heard? - Yes They go to the crypt No, that's not it It's a horse Calm down, little one - How lovely - Put it on, it's yours ls this where your victims die? Yes Like this? Yes Like that Hold still I don't want to hurt you I knew it And yet, you came... I knew I didn't want it to be you - Not you - Save me, Karl, save me It's too late, too late My love The court will hear evidence But nothing that's been said proves the Marquis was a vampire, - and not just a killer - How's that? The crimes were committed after his death I signed no death certificate So I cannot be certain he was actually dead My dear friend, why deny the most patent form of evidence The witness can step down. Call the widow now Erzebeth Bathory, Marquise of Cajlice We are sorry, to have you appear in this unpleasant place But we need you to identify your husband's body Karl Ziemmer, accused of vampirism Do you recognize him? Yes, this is the body of Karl Ziemmer who was my husband Thank you, madame You can leave if you wish But the court would appreciate some details concerning the death of the Marquis Some witnesses saw a connection between him and Dr. Plojovitz ls that true? You know very well I killed him We know you discovered him with one of his victims and that, in a way, you acted as the arm of justice But we are interested in his first death, before he became a vampire My husband was never a vampire I myself forced him to simulate his death I don't understand... - And yet... - What don't you understand? This, for example This blood, a moment ago, was just a dry stain See how it has changed Maybe it's just the heat, but... This paper, this strange text on how to die But it's not complete And the Plojovitz bottle Maybe... I don't know There must be a logical explanation - Karl, I... - I don't understand Or maybe I don't want to Just the vain hope to wake someday and everything will be changed and I will be changed Karl, things are possible, if you want them enough, really want them and have courage - What do you want, Erzebeth? - I want you No, you want beauty, youth, flesh To rejuvenate your skin with young blood Like the legend Like the other Erzebeth Maybe if I should die... die and start another life ls this not a land of vampires? Then my suspicions were true Remember Dr. Plojovitz's narcotic, that we found in the palace - Do you remember, Magistrate? - Silence! My Lady, you have not been asked to this court to be charged, but as a friend of justice Your words could make you an accomplice to the murders carried out by your husband Karl was just a coward I forced him to kill and bring me his victims' blood We understand that your grief compels you to accuse yourself, to destroy yourself Your words are contradictory Because if Karl served you thus, then why did you kill him? Did he have relations with the girl from the inn? No, she was just another victim I myself ordered her brought to the palace It's not true. Why are you lying, Erzebeth? You are right, sir, she's desperate with grief The only culprit was him, it was Karl Even my mistress was afraid of him Don't listen to her, please, she's lost her mind You know very well I bathed in the blood of those girls - No! - You yourself helped me do it - It's not true - Silence! Madam, if what you say is true, why did you kill him? I started this story by my will, I want to finish it the same way Don't listen to her, she's crazy and she hated Karl Now she wants to destroy him To destroy even his memory, don't listen to her Madam, think again Do you accuse yourselves as instigator of the deaths of Nadja Plojovitz, Irina Valerius, Inge Brossi, Sandra Vaczova and Marina Schneider? Yes I am the only one to blame for all those deaths And I assume all responsibility if I may... I must transmit the express wish of his majesty, whom I represent, as it concerns a person of royal blood, of possible disturbed mind, this trial is dismissed I accept that freeing the accused would be an injustice, creating problems of public order Therefore, I propose that along with the destruction of trial documents, Erzebeth Bathory, Marquise of Cajlice, be walled up in the rooms of her palace That her accomplice's tongue be cut out and she serve her mistress until the death of one or the other THE END
