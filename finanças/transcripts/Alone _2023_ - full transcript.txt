This is a story that happened when the pandemic brought the entire world to a halt. The story of a how a virus that cannot be seen with the naked eye, chained our lives. When the entire world was scared hearing news of deaths all around, only two people went forward bravely. One was the deadly virus that caused the Covid pandemic. And the other one was him, Kalidasan. [An area in Tamil Nadu] The country will be under a complete lockdown for three weeks from midnight today. India has become the latest and largest country to introduce The number of Covid cases and people who are in intensive care are rising. WHO has instructed that no one should step out for the coming 21 days. Experts too have the same opinion. [News on Covid continues] Moreover, if we check the daily counts, the number of cases are increasing. 12,443 people were under treatment at Government hospitals yesterday. Since the count of Covid patients in India has been rising, the Government has undertaken some strict measures. [Covid news continues in Hindi] Except one state in the country, all other states and union territories... 90% rise in Covid cases. 2183 more people have tested positive. We might have to wait for fourteen more days. Or else, we will have to sacrifice our lives. So, the Prime Minister has requested us to stay home until April 14th. The rise of patients affected by fever shouldn't be taken lightly. The Health Experts have instructed them to conduct Covid tests. State and Central Government institutions... and all other institutions related directly or otherwise to the Central Government, will be shut. [news continues] [news continues] Salutations to the supreme teacher! Brother! Security brother! Important notice. Security officer is under... blah blah blah... ...can be contacted through phone. [Important notice: Security officer is under Covid treatment] [In case of any emergency, he can be contacted on his mobile] - Hello. - Who is this? Kalidasan. Kali... Oh, I was informed that you were coming! The new tenant at 13A. I've left the key on the board. The flat was renovated recently. So, there won't be enough furniture. Okay. Transportation is an issue because of the lockdown. Let me know if you need anything urgently. I will get it for you. I got Covid. So, my assistants also became jobless. What to say? I was unfortunate to get infected during this time. - No. Don't say that, Brother. - It is not that, Sir. Getting sick is not a crime. Take medicines, Brother. Take rest. Ensure that you don't spread the disease to others. Keep distance. Okay? 13A. You go in front. I will follow you. - Hello! You reached, right Das? How did you know it, so precisely? - Coimbatore to Kochi is 190 kms, right? - Even on days with normal traffic, you take maximum 4 hours to cover that distance in that slow car. - During this complete lockdown, - it would be 3 hours, to be exact! - Now, a hot bath and... a solo celebration before you call it a night. Ah! Calculations! - Well, didn't the police stop you on the way? No. I never went where they were, and they never came my way either. - That's good! - Or else I would have had to bail you out! Is this the real life? - Hello? - Das? - Hello? - Are you there? - Well, how is the new place? - Peaceful? - Yes. This flat is beautiful. - Really? This place has the same clinical perfection... that you show while teaching kids. - What I don't understand is this. - Why did you go to Kochi? - If you got bored of Thrissur, you could have stayed here... - with me, in Coimbatore. - Here, I am listening to music to make up for your absence. - Tell me, Das. - Why are you in Kochi? - You didn't tell me even though I asked you several times. Whatever I was doing in Palakkad and Thrissur, I will be doing the same in Kochi. When I stay in the same city for a long time, I get bored of that city and... ...the city gets bored of me. A kind of... ...detachment. - Hello, - just like how you get bored of cities, - will you get bored of me? Hey, your favorite herbal tea, chutney made with mint, dosa made with butter, and as beautiful as poetry, your... your... your.... I will get bored if you don't give me these. Well, everything is a game of time and space, right? This is what we call "life". If that is not the case, think about this. Did we ever imagine that we would have to live like this... inside closed walls? Our science has reached Mars now. But everyone has to be afraid and run away from the atom... which cannot be seen with the naked eyes! This is a game. A game by consciousness. A hide and seek game between the conscious and the subconscious mind. - Das? what happened? - Hello. - Are you really alright? - Hey, did you get scared? - Yes. On the way here, I was listening to a sage on the FM radio. I just reproduced it. Why should you be afraid? Please sing a song. - Now? [Singing a classical song] Ragam is Kaapi. Talam is Adi. Sing! [Singing the same classical song] You should keep calling me. Keep singing for me. - This is enough! Keep thinking of me. That's love, romance, surrender, bliss! Glam... Glum... Blam! Anu! What is it? Did you do your homework? I will do it. Board exams are coming up. You will see my true colours if you don't score good marks in the exams. Can you keep quiet, Mom? Hey! You know it even if I don't tell you. Nowadays, many students score full marks in all subjects. Getting an A+ is not enough these days. You have to be the topper. Uff! I will study, Mom! Yeah, right! You still think you are a small child. Always cutting and sticking pictures in the notebook. Don't think that I am not aware of it. One day I will burn that book, Anu! You will learn only then! Why are you getting so hyper? Haven't I covered everything from the syllabus? If you want, you can conduct a revision test. I know very well that... you haven't touched your text books after the model exams. All this is your over confidence. It is not for me, Anu. It is for yourself. - Hello, Das. I don't know if you are aware of it. Nowadays, many students score full marks in all subjects. Getting an A+ is not enough these days. You have to be the topper. That is the only way. - What happened to you? That's what I also want to know. Is there anything wrong with this flat? Someone threw my half eaten burger into the waste bin. Someone threw away the water from my half empty glass! Some sort of... grand illusion! - What? How many pegs did you have? Me? I had a half... No, three-fourth. - Peg? - No. Bottle! - Okay. Then you will feel this way! - Hey Das! - From where did you get liquor during this lockdown? Even if there is a shortage of everything else, there won't be shortage of liquor, Yamuna! After all, I'm a Malayali, right? - Then, that's the reason! - Don't say that. - It is late, right? - Go to sleep. - Okay. - It will be alright when you wake up from sleep. No. It won't be alright. So many nights... along with so many great people, I have boozed at so many different places. This was a strange experience like never before. A bad experience. Why did it happen? That's what is disturbing me. - It happened because I am not with you. - You were in a hurry to leave me alone and go, right? - It is my... cur... Curse... curse. - That's it. Now you can suffer that. - I will call tomorrow. Good night. Hey! Yamuna! Hospital beds are getting full. Soon, there might be a scarcity of ventilators. Central finance minister promised to announce the covid financial package for workers in the unorganized sectors. DGP said that he has assigned a special team to investigate the murder in Thrissur. IG Hemanth Arora will investigate the case. Strict lockdown restrictions have been imposed in the state. The ministry has decided to start community kitchens. ICMR has asked those who have fever to undergo tests. - Dr. Susan! - Yes. This is what they call "telepathy". - What happened? - I just thought of calling you. - Okay. And you called at the exact same moment. - Oh okay. Tell me. Are you skilled in telepathy, Doctor? - I'm not skilled enough in my own job. - Then what would I know about telepathy? - You went to Kochi, Dasan? Yes. And I've landed in trouble too. - What happened? Conversation. - Okay. - One might be the Mom. - Oh! The other might be the daughter. They are not here. Only their conversations. - Where is it? In the flat where I am staying. - Okay... My oxygen level and temperature are normal. - Okay. - I don't have throat pain. - Body pain? - Body pain... No. - Okay. Is this COVID? - No. Never! What about the voices then? - Who knows? - It must be your imagination. Why? Why? Why am I imagining it? - Situation. - Isn't it a panic situation everywhere, Dasan? - Many have started falling into depression. - Anxiety has crossed all its limits. - Do you know how many calls are coming in? - Mark my words... - If the lockdown continues, the suicide rate in our state will increase. Don't say that! - Oh my! I don't want anyone to die. When a person dies, someone else becomes an orphan, becomes lonely. - All that is correct. - But the situation is that critical. - What can we do? - Forget that. - Do you know why I called you now? - I called to ask you about that car. - My son has been compelling me... - to get that car from you. - He is pestering me. - If you have a plan to sell it, please give it only to me. It is my favorite vehicle. - Let me see. - Thank you! - I am leaving then, Dasan. "Shall I hang up now?" is the right way to put it. - I am from Pala, right? - How can I forget my roots just because I got married and moved to Thrissur? Be it through phone or in real, I'll say "I'm leaving". "Then leave"! - That slang is from a place, a bit more south. - Onattukara! - Try to be energetic all the time. - It's a pandemic, right? - Stay fit by doing some Yoga. - Okay. So, "Shall I hang up now?" - Okay. - Bye! Hello. - Dear Sir, I am fed up of him! - If this continues, I will kill him and jump into the ocean! What is it, Maya? - He says that he is feeling restless. - He wants to go to that same old job. - Please make him understand that... - he should not miss this opportunity to reform. I will. I will have to do that. - Give it to him. - What? Give the phone to him. - Okay. - Bro, this is Hari Bhai. What is it, Hari Bhai? How many times have I told you... to introduce yourself as just "Hari"? - Well, it has become a habit. Your problem is in that name itself. - That "Bhai" in "Hari Bhai" has to go! - It's gone. - And you've to change to just "Hari". - I've changed. - You need to feel that you've changed. - I feel it. Only then will you become a good human. - Sorry, Bro. Since yesterday, my body is twitching, starting with my thumb. - I don't even have a penny with me. So what? - So I thought of... Thought of going back to your old job? - No, no. What are you saying, Bro? Hey, where did we first meet? Tell me. - We met... at the prison. Hey, don't say so! When you say so, it gives the impression that I too was in prison! - That is correct. When I visited the jail to give a motivation class for the prisoners, you came forward and introduced yourself when the class got over. - Oops! - What happened, Bro? It is nothing. - You screamed for no reason? That day, you stood in front of me and cried a lot. - You made me cry, right? You confessed that you want to quit the life you were leading until then, and start a new life like a proper human being. - That is true. You also promised that you will do as I tell you. - Isn't it true? - Yes, I promised. - What you said is correct, but... Based on that promise, when you were not getting a bail, I hired a good lawyer and bailed you out. - I agree, Bro. But... I am still in the process of reforming you, Hari. Even you're not aware of it! When that's your situation, why do you desire to become the old Hari Bhai? - I don't have any such desire, Bro. You already left that old life filled with murder and mayhem. - All that was in the past. It's lockdown, dear. - Yes, Bro. Isn't that the main problem? 700 crore people around the world are sitting inside their homes. - Yes. If your hands twitch, you should hug your wife! If you don't have money, you should plant some tapioca! Okay. I will, bro! You shouldn't be adamant on seeing a festival... when we don't even know if there will be any tomorrow! - No, Bro. I will never do that. Hey, give the phone to Maya. - Okay. I will give it to her. Yes, sir. Don't you love him, dear? Yes, Sir. In fact, the love has increased after the lockdown started. He is slowly changing for the good. Once in a while, that old animal will scratch his knots from the inside. That is a common trait... seen in people with a criminal background. During such times, hug him close like this. No man in our entire history has ever left a woman... ...who hugs him with true love and affection. I understand, Sir. Everything will be alright. Stay calm. I know I am disturbing you with my calls. I don't have any other option, Sir. I don't have any problem. Isn't this my job? Correcting the ones who are treading the wrong path. Change them into good people. Is there any other deed more righteous that this? Bye! I would have fallen now! Hello. - Hello. This is the security officer, Sir. - Why did you step outside now? - We have arranged to deliver milk, vegetables and fruits for you, right? - Moreover, there is no one in that flat. In which flat? - The flat in front of you. 13-B. - Hello? Sir? - What are you looking for, Sir? - The CCTV camera is connected to my phone, Sir. - I can see everything, sitting here. Go to your apartment, shut the door and stay inside. Where did the tenants of this flat go? - They passed away, Sir! - They are dead? - Yes. - Both of them had Covid. - It started with a fever. - But gradually it turned into pneumonia. - With that, things went out of control. Was it a mom and her daughter who used to live there? - No, it was a couple. - They were not so old. - They were just fifty years old. - Shall I hang up, Sir? - Health department officers have come to the 10th floor. - I have to talk to them. - Okay then, Sir. [This is our home] Anu! Are you not ready yet? School van has reached downstairs, dear! I am coming, Mom! Is this how you tie your hair? It is not fair to be stubborn that I have to do this for you everyday. When are you going to do all this on your own? This is enough, Mom. I have kept the tab for charging in the room, Mom. Don't switch it off when you leave for office. I have to complete my project in the evening. - Okay. - Bye bye! Bye. [Covid warning message] - Hi Das. - Yamuna. - Yes. When I told you yesterday that something was wrong with this flat, you mocked me saying that it's all my imagination. Now I am telling you this in a totally sober state. There is something wrong here! Besides me, there are two other persons living in this flat. - What all are you saying, Das? - Two persons other than you? - In that flat? - Yes. It is a mother and her daughter. I am hearing their voices. Through that, I am feeling their presence. [voices] I feel scared, Yamuna. Scared? - I have not seen anyone who's braver than you in my entire life. - When that goon, Kovai Ganesh, groped me in that shopping mall, - didn't you thrash him in his office in broad daylight? - How many other incidents like that? They were all humans, right? These are not humans, right? - If so, who are they? - Ghosts? Yes. They are ghosts. - It is Covid and lockdown. - Otherwise, I would have come there to give my reply. - Stay calm for the time being, Das. - We will find some way. - We have to, Yamuna. - We will. - I am in trouble. - You go and sleep peacefully now. - Okay? I will call you later. Bye! I am in trouble! I am in trouble! I am in trouble! [Covid warning message] - Hello. Colonel Sir. This is Kalidas. - Hi Kali! - Where are you calling from? - From Kochi. - Oh you reached here? When did that happen? - Two days back. - Okay. You should help me. Please don't say "No". - Hey, tell me. I am in big trouble. - Hey, what happened? Do you have any bottle with you? - What if I have? I want it. All of it! - I might have 3-4 bottles. But how will you collect them? I will catch hold of some youngster who does food delivery. They will deliver it if I promise them some money. - Okay boy. Send your guys. - But it will be difficult to catch them... - if they slip away with the bottles during this Covid. - Liquor is costlier than gold in these times! I know, Sir. I am not just "Kalidasan" in front of them, right? Kalidasan IPS! Is there any delivery boy in Kochi... brave enough to disobey the order of a high ranking police officer... and slip away with the bottles? - Oh great! Okay. That is you! - There is no one like you! - I will keep them packed. Send the boys. Thank you, Sir. Thank you! [This is our home] Anu! Haven't I told you not to speak to him? You have told her many times. He is a bad person, Anu. He is not worth dealing with. It was not me. It was he who came and spoke to me. Even then, you should not talk back to him. Okay, Mom. We cannot trust anything these days. You should understand that there is no one to help us... if something goes wrong. He is getting braver when I try to avoid him. Why can't you talk to him directly? Will I be able to accompany you all the time? You must speak out in places where you're supposed to speak. I am not afraid of anything. But he has not said or done anything... for me to physically react to him! You have to be very careful, dear. You too see the news, right? Not a scratch should fall on your body. That's my prayer. Don't get worried, Mom. I know how to take care of myself. [This is our home] - What is it? - You're sending a blank message in the morning itself! Blank message? - Yes. - Yamuna. - Das? This is it. This is the problem I am facing. Here, in front of me... it is clearly written, "This is our home". I had erased it yesterday. It appeared again today. I took a photo and sent it to you so that you will also be aware of it. The image which got captured in my phone... disappeared when it reached your phone! - Oh, it is confusing, Das! - I can't understand anything. I too cannot understand it! I will tell you one thing very clearly. - There are spirits in this flat. - That's for sure! - Wherever you are, "spirit" is a must, right? This is not that kind of spirit. This is the original spirit. Ghost! The soul which resides in all bodies! The Soul, which is said to be indestructible! Please do me just one favour. You have to shift me from this flat to another flat. It is a request. - Only I know how difficult it was to get this one! - Don't you know that? - The flat owner is in America. - I had to plead a lot to get it. - It is lockdown. - No one can move in this situation. - And you are demanding this? What else should I do? I am totally disturbed, Yamu. Are you saying that I should lose my peace of mind? - I didn't mean it that way, Das. Please help me if you can. If not, I know what I should do. - What will you do all alone during this lockdown? Real heroes... are always alone! [classical dance chants] [classical dance chants continue] [classical dance song] Stop it! Why are you disturbing me like this? What wrong did I do to you? - Sir. - Hey. - Tell me, Sir. In this apartment no. 13-A, where I am staying now, did a mother and daughter stay before me? - Yes. Was the daughter's name, Anu? - Yes. The mother's name was Sreedevi. Where are they now? - I don't know! Are they alive? - Why do you ask so, sir? How else should I ask? Are they dead or alive? You just have to say that. - I don't know, Sir. I can hear your conscience saying that you know it. Even the feeble vibrations in your voice speaks a lot! Give me her phone number. You have it with you, right? - Yes, Sir. Send it to me quickly. Now itself. Quick! - Okay. [This number can't be reached right now. Please try later.] Who is it? Who is it? I am the new tenant at 13-A. Kalidasan. Oh, Kalidasan. The security guard had told me that you had come. Covid is all around, right? That's why I didn't come to meet you. The caretaker has instructed us not to go to any other flat during this period. He said that we shouldn't allow anyone else into our flats either. Keep distance, right? Yes. That's right. Well, why have you come now? Son! Son! Kalidasan? The tenants who were staying in 13-A before me, were a woman called Sreedevi and her daughter Anu, right? Errr... Yes. Sreedevi was a good lady. Her daughter too. Well, why did you ask about them? Do you know where they are now? I don't know, son. I was not here when they shifted from here. I was in Bangalore with my elder son. Well, do you know Sreedevi? Yes, I know her. I'm acquainted with her. Let this Covid period get over. We will meet in person. I am alone here. My daughter is in Thiruvananthapuram. She got stuck there. Lockdown was declared all of a sudden, right? Yes. Everything happened very quickly, right Aunty? Okay, Aunty. Aunty? - Aunty! - Yes, we will meet later. We will meet later. Milk is on the stove! Dr. Susan! Do you know why Covid happened? It happened because of man's arrogance. Nowadays people become happy... ...when they destroy other's comfort and peace, right? That's why only humans got Covid, while animals didn't! - What happened? - You're fuming in the morning itself. Sreedevi and Anu. No one here knows what happened to them. But I want to know what happened to them. - I will send you the name of a medicine on WhatsApp. - Buy it and take it. - See if you are still hearing those voices, after that. Thank you Doctor. Thank you. - Okay then. So be it. After all, everything is a game of the mind, right? Many things that we believe to exist, do not exist, right? If truth be told, this universe itself is an illusion, right? - Dasa? - Yes. - I like philosophy. - But I don't have time right now. I am in the kitchen. - I am making Chinese Potato curry. Chinese potato curry! Oh yes! Chinese potato curry! - Doctor? - Yes. If you add long slices of red onion along with Chinese potato... - If I add it? - It will be even more delicious. - Okay. I will add it. - Okay. I am leaving now. Okay, you may leave now. Nuplazid 45 mg. - Das? Yes. I have decided, Yamuna. Sreedevi and Anu. I will find them. - Oh, there you go again! - You have this habit of getting involved in other people's lives. - I keep asking you to control it, right? - Yet, you never listen to me, Das! Two people who moved away from this flat... That too, two females! Why should I hear their voices? This universe is bound by cause and effect. Nothing in this world happens without a cause. - Butterfly effect. Yes! Butterfly effect... by which small changes in initial conditions can lead to... large scale and unpredictable variations in the future state of system. The small fluttering of a butterfly in Coimbatore might be... the root cause of a large cyclone that hits California in America! Shapes of shapeless ones! So, I am starting my journey... to find the secrets behind those voices. - It's lockdown period. - It's a pandemic. I like obstacles. They create new opportunities. That has been my experience so far. I will call you later. I will let you know the details. - Take care, Das. Love you! Love you too! Love you! I love obstacles! Complete lockdown in India. A complete lockdown has been declared in the country to stop the Covid pandemic. The Prime Minister pointed out that there's no other option other than a lockdown, to stop the pandemic, while declaring the lockdown. Wherever the people are... ... are allowed to step out to get essential services... but there are police check-points across the city that are preventing people who are not either rendering or accessing... [cricket commentary] What's happening in the kitchen? A bottle fell down, Mom. Oh! You broke that too? - It just slipped. - Sigh! How many times have I told you... to be careful when you take things from there? I am sorry, Mom. Hmm. Sorry! You keep giving me trouble all the time. Unruly girl! Mom, that recipe which I saw on YouTube yesterday... Shall I cook it? Yeah, right! Cooking seems really easy while watching YouTube. Every job has its own share of difficulties, Anu. Especially, cooking. You already have a duty, right? - What duty? - Studies! Just do that. I don't need any help from you right now. That's the greatest help you can give me. That's all! - Sir? - Where are you calling from? - Its been a long time since you called. - Where are you right now? - In station or out? Vinod, lockdown has not affected journalists, right? Not at all! Are we not a group who works even during the strikes? - 24/7 on duty. - What is it, Sir? - I need a favor, Vinod. - A favor? For you? Tell me, Sir. I have sent you an address... ... of a lady called Sreedevi and her daughter Anu. I want their details. Who are they? What do they do? Where are they right now? All that. It's the lockdown, right? Otherwise, I'd have stepped out and enquired myself. - I know, Sir. I'll find that out for sure. So, don't forget. Sreedevi and Anu. - I will call you the moment I get something. - Okay? - Okay. - Well, are you doing fine? Since I don't have any ailments, I can say that I am fine. - Okay, Vinod. - Okay, Sir. Mom. It's him. The man who bothers us. Then, let's not open the door, dear. You go inside. Will he hurt us, Mom? No, dear. I know how to make him stay within his limits. - Hello Sir. - Hey, Chief Security Officer! - Yes. I have sent Rs. 10,000 to your account now. - I got it, Sir. That's why I called you. Okay. - Hey, it's Covid, right? - Yes. - It's lockdown, right? - Yes. You should have money if something comes up, right? - Thank you so much, Sir. - I was struggling without money. But I don't give money to anyone for free. Now that you have accepted Rs. 10,000 from me, I want to know that secret. Who was the person bothering Sreedevi? - Sir? I am sure that he's a resident of this flat. And you know him. Who is it? Sir, my job... You useless! You are not a district judge, right? If you lose this job, I will get you another good job. Tell me. Who was that troublemaker? Say it! Thomas Kuruvila. He is the caretaker here. My dear Sir, please don't tell anyone that I told this to you. What's his phone number? Say it! A list of emergency numbers will be pasted at the kitchen area. You can find his number in that list. - Hello. Isn't this Thomas Kuruvila? - Yes. Who is this? Kalidasan. Kalidasan, from 13-A. - Aah! Kalidasan. - This is the first time we're talking, right? I don't know whose bad luck it is... that it's happening in such a situation. Where are they, Thomas? Sreedevi and her daughter. - Which Sreedevi? You don't know them? Sreedevi, who was staying in 13-A before me. Sreedevi, who moved away from here because she was afraid of you. - I have Covid, my friend. - Or else, I would have come there personally to give my answer. [The number you are calling is currently switched off.] [The number you are calling is currently switched off.] [Please try later] Tell me, Vinod. - Is this Sreedevi related to you in any way, Sir? No. Why? - I checked. - The address on the Aadhaar card you sent me, was of their previous rented house. - Sreedevi didn't have any relatives. - So, it was difficult to collect the information. Where is she now? - It's a sad news. - She... she is no more, sir. - She is no more. She committed suicide. Where did this happen? - It happened in an apartment complex in the city. - Police didn't give me the name of the apartment. - I am a journalist, right? They must be fearing publicity. Okay, Vinod. - Anything wrong, Sir? No, nothing at all. Thank you. Okay. [This is our home] - Das? Everyone, including you, tried to stop me. You blamed that it was just my imagination. But I was right! My imagination was right. - What happened, Das? Just like I suspected. That woman and her daughter are no more. Suicide! Police is not willing to reveal... even the name of the private apartment where it happened. But I know it. The name of that flat is "Strawberries". I know the flat number too. 13-A! I just need to know one more thing now. Why did they commit suicide? I will find that too. The forces which brought me... to this flat during this lockdown... will have some goals, right? I will fulfill those goals. I will find the reason behind the death of... that poor woman and her daughter. - Sir. Where were you all this while? I was going on calling you. - I didn't answer it, out of fear. Repentance of the guilty! So you know everything, right? - Not everything, Sir. - But I know certain things. - Those two committed suicide inside that flat. Why didn't you say this earlier? Yamuna, who got this flat for me, didn't know about it either. - Most people don't know. - They were not informed. - Kuruvila Sir told me specifically not to inform anyone. - Kuruvila Sir said that if the news about this suicide leaks out, - it will affect the sale of the other flats as well. - Most of the flat owners are abroad. - Most of the flats have been given for rent. - Will anyone come and stay here if they know about the suicide? So everyone, for their own selfish greed, brushed those deaths under the carpet. Have you not heard that... the blood of righteous men will scream from their graves? - Sir... Those screams will bring out the truth! Call your Thomas Kuruvila and tell him this! Whomsoever is responsible for the deaths of that mother and daughter, I won't spare them! The meaning of the word "Caretaker" is... ..."one who saves"! I will teach this to him. Hang up! - I was thinking about what you said, Das. - Sreedevi, Anu... - and that Thomas Kuruvila. - But weren't they suicides, Das? - How will you connect those deaths to Thomas? What if it's proved later that these deaths were not suicides? - Don't think that I am questioning your logic. - Why are you adamant that you should get involved in every issue around you? - Another thing. I spoke to my uncle in Thanjavur. - When the Covid restrictions are over, Are over...? - Uncle told that we can have the function at Guruvayur or Madurai Meenakshi temple. - An age difference of 12 years was considered perfect... - back in the day, apparently. - Moreover, you have always given me equal consideration, right? - You even gave me freedom to call you anything! The one giving you equal consideration and... the one who's going to marry you... is Das, the lover who believes in gender equality. And the one who is going to expose the person responsible... for the deaths of Sreedevi and Anu... is Kalidasan, the citizen who respects the judiciary. - Aren't they the same person? - At least for me? Oh Yamuna...Yamuna! There is something known as inborn nature! However well you act, no one can run and hide from it. It was after leaving behind all the worldly comforts... that King Siddhartha went searching for the reason behind man's suffering... and became Sri Buddha. I don't want to become a Buddha. Can't I continue to be myself? Isn't that my minimum right? Isn't it? - Okay, I agree. But, being alone at this time! That's what I can't understand. I am not alone in this house. They are also here, right? That mother and daughter! Their life force of fire is still here, in this flat. When nine out of the ten life forces leave for the heavens, one did not leave the earth. When that life force of fire is here with me, how will I be alone? You keep talking to your uncle in Thanjavur. Should it be in Guruvayur, Madurai or Amsterdam? Let us decide that peacefully, later on. - Everything as you like, Das! What I like is you! You, who moved from Ottapalam to Coimbatore and got settled there. Yamuna Krishnan. - Thank you, Das. - I will sleep well tonight. It's been several days since I lost my sleep. At least you can sleep well. Have a beautiful sleep. - Good night. - Good night. - Bro! - Hari. - Yes. Do you know any policeman at town station? - What kind of question is that, Bro? - It's my own place, right? - I have spent many nights in that lockup. - There is one ASI. Rasheed Sir. Shall I ask him to call you? No need. I will call Rasheed. - Why? There's no need for that. - I will ask Rasheed Sir to call you. - Make it fast. - He will call you right away. Okay - Hello. - Hello. - Is this Kalidas? - Sir, this is Rasheed... - from town station. Oh, Rasheed! Hari Bhai told about you. - ASI? - Yes, Sir. - Rasheed. - Tell me, Sir. In Strawberries flat, which comes under your station limits, a mother and daughter committed suicide a while ago. Sreedevi and Anu. - Strawberries... Sreedevi and Anu. - I don't remember if those were the names. - A mother and daughter had died on February 14th of last year. - On Valentine's Day. How did you close that case? - They had some financial issues. - Her husband died in an accident. - Since it was a love marriage, - she was isolated, without support from her family. - People who knew her said that she used to borrow money from here and there. - Why? Are you interested in going behind it? What if I am? - Cases like these will stick only if... - somebody is there to help from the outside. - Or else, these cases usually evaporate into thin air. So, are you saying that this case has enough merit for that? - If you ask me that, my answer would be both yes and no. - Sir, cases like these are like that. - If you dig deep enough, you will find something. - You can give it a try. - You might hit something hard! You should be with me, Rasheed. - This Hari Bhai was a constant headache for the policemen in this station. - If you were able to clean him up, - you must be really something! - I will be there for you, even at midnights. - Just give me a call. - Okay, Rasheed. Thank you. - Okay. - Hello. - Hello? Hello. - Who are you? - I asked you who you are! - Why did you enter the CCTV control room? Who are you to ask this? - I am the secretary of this flat's residents' association. - O.G. Karthavu. So, you are the next person whom I have to interrogate! - Hey Karthave! - What? Shall I make you remember your karma? - Are you a policeman, Sir? What if I am? Hey Karthav, in flat no. 13-A where I am staying now, the former tenants, a mother and daughter, committed suicide... last year on February 14th. I came here to check if something out of the ordinary... happened in that flat on that day. I want to know who all came to that flat on that day. I want the digital details of that. - You won't find that footage there. - Maximum 1 month. Anything older is not kept there. - There is no backup. - Moreover, after those deaths, - Thomas Kuruvila destroyed all the footage until then. Doesn't that mean he has something to hide? - I don't know about all that. - Thomas Kuruvila told me not to keep the visuals... - ...showing those bodies being taken away from here. - This is the age of social media, right? - If some kids upload those visuals on YouTube, who will get affected? - Us, the residents of this flat! That's how it is! So, it means that there is no use sitting here now. - You can search that room if you don't believe me, Sir. - You can take all the devices from there. That's not required. I believe you, Karthavu. - Happy to hear that! - Are you from the Cyber Cell, Sir? No. - Where are you from, then? Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, New Delhi. - Hello, Dr. Susan! - Yes. Do women commit suicide because of financial liabilities? - It happens very rarely. - Even in those cases, there will be a male along with them. - A husband or a father. - Why are you asking? Is it that mother and daughter again? Yes. They committed suicide on the previous Valentine's Day. - Oh, so sad! Financial difficulty was the reason. That's what the police records say. But I don't believe it. - Normally, women are quicker than men in adapting to difficult situations. - Their lives have a long legacy of tolerance, spanning centuries! - I don't think financial liability would drive them to commit suicide. - Some other reason... - Enough! This is enough. I was afraid you would say that... women do commit suicide because of financial liabilities. Had you said that... I wouldn't have backed out even if you had said it... because... Isn't it Sreedevi who is driving me... to find the reason for her death? - So, you got a good job during lockdown. - Whatever it is, go ahead! - May you find the answer, as soon as possible. - Another thing... - How are you feeling after taking that medicine I gave that day? Hey, it was of no use! I threw it away. - Great! Do you know how much I referred before prescribing it to you? I am not cursing you only because... I remember the taste of that cake you made for me! Well, we should not lie to doctors and lawyers, right? That's why I told the truth. Let it be. - Okay then. I am leaving. - Okay, you may leave. Happy birthday! - Happy birthday, Bro! Hari! Was it you who kept this cake over here? - Yes, Bro. - Today is April 26th, right? - So, it is for my happiness. Okay? While beating the whipping cream, tell them to be more careful. - What cream, Bro? - And... - Brandy is always better than rum. - Okay. - Brandy, right? But it should not be more than one spoon. - I will tell them, Bro. - Hari? - Yes. Let us talk later. I am getting another call. - Okay, Bro. - Das? Love is not what you show me. When you all limit your birthday wishes to a phone call, someone here is expressing it by bringing a cake to my flat! - So early in the morning? - Yes. That's the difference between the common man and college professors. When you hint at love using metaphors, the common man pours it out from his heart! - Then take out the cake. - Let us cut it while seeing each other in a video call. I already had a piece. - Oh, that's fine. - You can have it once again for my sake. - Make a video call then. - Okay. - Hey, you look smart! - Shouldn't I be smart? - Happy birthday Das! - Thank you! [Singing a prayer by Sreenarayana Guru] Salutations to the teacher! [Singing a prayer by Sreenarayana Guru] - Birthday cake! - Let me see it. - Wow! Beautiful! Happy birthday to you! - What happened? Happy birthday to you! What happened, Das? - Hey! Happy birthday, dear Anu! What happened? - Happy birthday to you! - Thank you, Mom. - Das? I love you so much! - I am hanging up, Yamuna. - What happened? Another birthday function is going on here. - I will attend that and come. - Das! Mom, it's him! You go to that room. I will stop his nuisance today! How many times have I told you that I don't like seeing or talking to you? Then why did you come here with this cake? I am here to buy cakes for my daughter's birthday. My daughter and I are not so unfortunate to get it from a guy like you! Wait and see! I am going to write a complaint and give it to the police station today itself. I am going to end this disease of yours! [Covid warning message] - Rasheed? This is Kalidasan. - Tell me, Sir. Check whether Sreedevi had filed any complaint at the station... ...against Thomas Kuruvila, the caretaker of this flat, on April 26th of last year. - April 26th, right? - Yes. - Okay, Sir. I will call after I check it out. Okay. - Hello. - Did you get it, Rasheed? - No, Sir. - I searched thoroughly. - She hasn't given any complaint. If there was such a complaint, it would have been a preliminary evidence against the convict. - Investigation is going well, right? There is no clear evidence, Rasheed. I know the person. But he has to admit the crime, right? For him to do that, there should be evidence. That's what is missing and what I am searching for! - If you have reached this far, - the rest will also follow, some way or the other. - Go ahead boldly, Sir. I hope so. I pray so. - If God wills it! - God will protect. If God wills it! Who is it? Is it Kalidasan? Yes, Aunty! It's Kali. What is it, dear? Since today is my birthday, Aha! I made some Payasam today. When I made it, I felt like giving some of it to you. How sweet! No need to open the door, Aunty! I have kept the Payasam container here. You can open the door and take it, once I leave. Okay. I will take it. Not just Payasam... There's cake too. Wow! You're great! Where are your relatives? I have relatives all over this world, Aunty! May all beings everywhere be happy and free! - Isn't that how it is? - Yes. Well, what about your parents? Kali? Have you left? Have you left, son? Son! They are all there... ... at another place. I will tell you everything when we meet in person. Fine. That's fine, son. This is such a bad time. Or else, I would have prepared a traditional feast for you. I have not seen you in person, son. In spite of that, I am feeling very close to you. Everyone who meets me, say that to me. That's a blessing from God. And, Aunty... About Thomas Kuruvila, the caretaker... Do you know him? Yes, I know him. How is he, as a person? Why do you ask so, son? I want to meet his friends. Do you know who they are? There are plenty of people. Not all of them. Close friends. People who'd know his deepest secrets. People with whom he would discuss right and wrong. Yes, there is someone like that. Sheela Varkey, who stays in 10-C. I have heard many people say that they are closer than they're supposed to be. Sheela Varkey, 10-C. But please don't tell Sheela that I told you this. Will I say that, Aunty? I never reveal the source of information to anyone. Well, why are you enquiring all this? Just like that. Do take this Payasam and cake, Aunty! I will take it, dear. You can have these even if you have diabetes. I don't have diabetes, dear. May God give you a long life, and also the good fortune of celebrating many more birthdays. That's it! Thank you, Aunty! Who is it? Kalidasan. Kali... ...Das. Dasan. Dasettan. You can call me any of these, as per your convenience. Oh! The new tenant at 13-A, right? Wow! So, the information is reaching here promptly. My job will be easy then. I won't disturb you much, Madam. Just one question. Does Thomas Kuruvila know anything... regarding the death of Sreedevi and her daughter Anu, the earlier tenants of 13-A? Thomas Kuruvila... No, no. He has nothing to do with it. How do you know that, Sheela? That... ...was a suicide. Police also reached that conclusion, right? I won't believe it. You don't have to believe it. Everyone has the freedom to believe it or not. God bless you! Sorry. I am not feeling well. Is it Covid? I haven't tested. Don't test. Don't do it. I can say it without any tests. If Thomas Kuruvila gets Covid, his friend will also get it. Covid is a pandemic that spreads only through close contact. So, keep distance. Keep distance! What do you want now? There is no relationship between me and Thomas, unlike what's being said by some upper class gossip mongers in this flat. I don't care even if there is a relationship. That is not my concern. But if he promptly informed you about my phone call, Thomas Kuruvila must have also told you the reason behind the deaths that happened on 14th February. No. I don't know anything. Covid is a blessing for at least some people. Thomas Kuruvila is that kind of a person. And now, Sheela Varkey as well! But what did I do? Even though you knew the details regarding the deaths, you didn't disclose it. That's a punishable offence. According to the Indian Penal Code, it's a punishable offence. Sir... Who are you, Sir? Where are you from? Department of Universal Declaration of Human Rights, United Nations, Geneva. [Covid warning message] - Rasheed. - Yes, Sir. Can you get me a copy of that postmortem report? - Why not? If possible, that surgeon's number too. - I will send it right away. - Dr. Susan! - Yes. A person is not telling the truth, deliberately. - We have to take it out from his mind. - Okay. Hypnotizing him would be the best way to do it, right? - No. - No? I have seen it in a lot in movies. - That's in the movies, right? - It cannot be done in real life. - Medical science says that it should not be done. - Isn't all this a psychological move to find out many things? Do you know it, Doctor? - Not at all! I don't know it. Shucks! I expected a lot. What should I do now? - Did you catch the murderer? He is nearby, in front of me. There is a curtain of Covid between us. That curtain will fall. I will catch him then. Yet, everything will come to a standstill if he denies the crime. Just like a switch turned off. That should not happen. I am trying for that. - What if we file a petition in court demanding a CBI investigation? No. That's not necessary, Doctor. If I go after a case, and there's no result in the end, it will be a shame. - Don't forget that you are not a police officer, Das. When the system fails, a power will emerge. That's a universal law, right? I believe in that law. - All the best! - But hynotization cannot be done. - Think of some other way. Okay, Doctor. I am leaving. - I have something for you. - What? - A good beating! - Let's meet in person. I'll give it then. This care... This love... I have seen this only in my Dr. Susan! Tell me, Rasheed. - I have sent you the copy of the postmortem report. - You won't get anything from it. - It's written that it was a suicide. And that surgeon's number? - He got retired. - The old number is switched off. - I am enquiring. I will call you when I get it. All the paths are closing, dear. What will we do now? Hello. - This is Karthavu. What? - Hello! O.G.Karthavu. Oh, okay. - I've called to share a sad news. - Sad news? - Yes. - Sheela Varkey passed away! How? When? - She had Covid. Body? - The body has been shifted to the mortuary. - No one was informed. - Pandemic is going on, right? - Well, - Sheela had called me an hour before she died. - She told me that if anything happened to her, - I should give you the letter which is kept... - inside the Bible near the prayer area in her flat. - I have kept that letter outside your flat, Sir. To Kalidasan. You said that I know all the secrets of Thomas Kuruvila. It is true, to an extent. I know Thomas Kuruvilla's true character very well. If Sreedevi and her daughter have committed suicide, there can be only one reason behind it. Thomas Kuruvilla! Thomas was trying to replace me with Sreedevi. Since Sreedevi was not interested in becoming Sheela Varkey, she ended it all by hanging from a rope. If anything happens to me, Thomas Kuruvila's secrets should not get destroyed. That's the purpose of this letter. Haven't you heard the news, Thomas? - What news? Sheela Varkey, her letter... Everything is against you. The letter Sheela wrote to me, has her dying declaration against you. You cannot escape. You will have to tell what happened in flat 13-A... on February 14th, the day Sreedevi and Anu died. - What happened? Nothing happened. Didn't you go there on that day? - I went there. But Sreedevi did not open the door, as always. But you did not go back. You stood there itself. You tried to persuade her by saying many things. When that did not work, you forcefully opened the door and went inside. - I would have done that. - I had that intention when I went there. - But someone else was there on that day. - Someone other than Sreedevi and Anu. Who was it? - I don't know. - It was a man. - While I was planning to find out who it was, - the deaths happened. - With that, all my calculations went wrong. You are trying to mislead me deliberately. When you understood that the investigation has reached your doorstep, you are trying to point fingers at someone else, intentionally. Tell me the truth. You said that there was another man. That's a lie, right? - Sheela Varkey has died today. - I won't lie on this day, Kalidasan. - You know better than me that... - you can't do anything to me with a letter written by Sheela Varkey. - I told you the truth. - Another person was in that flat on February 14th. Then why didn't you tell this to the police? - If I had told them, they would have seize all the CCTV footage. - It has the footage of me standing in front of that flat, right? - Why should I get into trouble unneccessarily... Shut up! [Covid warning message] - Hello, Sir. No visitors had been to 13-A on February 14th. If so, their names would have been on this register. Either you didn't write that name in this register, deliberately. Or else, no one came there that day. - Someone came, Sir. - I didn't do it deliberately. They came in a car. - That guy, Sreedevi and her daughter. - If a guest comes along with the residents, we don't write it down. Then why didn't you tell me about that guy till now? - You didn't ask me, right Sir? - Sir, this flat is a storeroom of secrets, - some of which that can be told and some that cannot be told! - If I do my job, not seeing or listening to any of it, - I can work here for a long time. When did that guy leave? - It must be around 9 pm. Do you know his car number? - No, Sir. It was a big car. - A black car. I do not remember anything else. Will you be able to identify that guy if you see him again? - I can, Sir. - Hang up the phone now! - Vinod. - Yes, Sir. A new character has entered the scene now! - Who is it? - We don't know his name. We don't know how he was related to Sreedevi, the deceased. It was in his costly car that Sreedevi and her daughter... came to this flat on the day they died. He was also with them. If we can believe what the security guard says, he left at around 9 p.m. The time of death is 12 a.m., as per the post-mortem report. That means, Sreedevi killed herself 3 hours after he left. - Then we cannot suspect him, right? Yes, not at this point. But something within me is telling me that... there is some connection between his arrival and the deaths. - Hello? - Hello? Police say that financial pressure was the reason behind Sreedevi's death. That does not go well with this costly car! Next, what we should do and what we missed to do is... to check the office where Sreedevi worked. Who were Sreedevi's co-workers? What do they have to say about Sreedevi? To find that out, all that we have are... Sreedevi's old address and a non-functioning phone number. If I am not troubling you much, can you please check this for me? - Leave the trouble aside, Sir. - Let us focus on this matter. - I will do this, Sir. Oh thank you, Vinod! All the best. Tell me, Rasheed. - I found that surgeon, Sir. - No matter how many times I asked, he's still saying that it was a suicide. - I don't know if it's because I am a policeman... - I have a feeling that he is lying. Send me his address and phone number. - Okay. I will make him say the truth. - Okay Sir. - I will send it to you right away. [Covid warning message] - Hari. - Bro. You should listen carefully to what I am going to say now. - Okay, Bro. I need a favor from you. - Tell me, Bro. What do you want, Bro? Hari... Who are you now? Hari or... Hari Bhai? - My days of being the "Bhai" are over, right? You were "Hari Bhai" when we met. Yes. But didn't you give me counselling and turn that "Hari Bhai" into "Hari"? In that case, if I try, I can turn you back into that old "Hari Bhai", right? - What is it, Bro? - I didn't understand. You should become the old "Hari Bhai" for some time, for me. - For some time...? What is it, Hari? Can't you do that? - How can I refuse something if you ask me? I will tell you what you have to do, one after the other. It's not for any of us. It's for a poor woman and her daughter. It is for their departed souls. I will forward a phone number and an address to your phone. That phone number is of a retired surgeon. You should go meet him and give your phone to him. - I will give, Bro. - Whatever I want to ask him, I will ask him myself. - I will leave right away, Bro. It is lockdown. - Yes, Bro. Police? Police? - I am Hari Bhai, Bro! Hari Bhai! So, finally we are closing in... on the killer. That's Vinod. [This is our home] - Hello. - Tell me, Vinod. Did you get the details? - I got it, Sir. - You said it was a black car, right? - Yes. - It is a Range Rover. - Sreedevi was working in a finance company. It's the company owner's car. - What the police said is true, Sir. - Sreedevi had debts. - Earlier, Sreedevi was working in a different finance company. - She enrolled many people in schemes. - When that company closed down, - those people started asking money from Sreedevi. - It was the owner of her new company who settled all her debts. - But no one has a good opinion of him. That is obvious. That should be obvious. Binoy! Isn’t that his name? - Yes. How did you know that? Telepathy! B for Bat. - This is Hari Bhai, Bro. - I am with him now. That surgeon. - Pass the phone to him. - Okay. Sreedevi and her daughter, Anu. Your post-mortem report says that both of them committed suicide. You know that it is not correct. Now, I too know that. The deaths did not happen at 12 am. They happened at 9 pm. The name of the person who tempted you... to alter the post mortem report is "Binoy", right? Isn't it? Bhai! - Isn't it? - Open your mouth and say it, bugger. - Yes! - Yes! Pass the phone to Hari. - Tell me, Bro. - Hari. - Bro. It is his turn next. Binoy's. - I know, Bro. - I have sent you his photo and address. - Okay. You should have an iron rod with you when you go to meet him. A weapon! - I will take the tool, Bro. - I will take the tool. - You should go at night. - Okay. Make him come out of the house. Take him to a secluded spot. - Okay. I will tell you the rest then. And before you leave from there, to remind him of your visit forever, give a gift to that poor doctor! - I will, Bro. - I will give it, Bro! Let go of me! You broke his hand, right? - No, Bro. It was his leg! - But I took a finger from his hand. Very good. It was with that finger that he engraved that "truth"! B for Bat. A for Apple. D for Donkey. T for Tiger. O for Orange. U for Umbrella. C for Cat. H for Horse. Bad Touch. - Hari Bhai. - Bro. - Did you get him? - I will put him on. - Hello. We don't know each other, right? I regret that we are getting acquainted in such a situation. Sreedevi, Anu. You murdered them and hanged them, right? - Who are you? Who am I? That has no relevance here, Binoy. What was it that you did? Only that is relevant here. Bad touch! Bad touch. Not just the mother. You wanted the child too, right? You gave money, a job and a place to live... for that poor lady and tried to exploit her unfortunate situation. When she didn't yield, you murdered her. - Kalidas, - please listen to what I have to say. No need for that! You may have many reasons, many justifications. What happened? That's what is important. I don't want to hear anything else. Didn't they beg in front of you? Didn't they cry and plead? You didn't heed to those. Instead, you committed a crime. You committed a crime. Committed a crime. Committed a crime. Pass the phone to Hari Bhai. Bro. Tell me, Bro. Hari Bhai. Yes. I want to hear him cry. Not the kind of cry, when just one of the body parts is hurt. Okay. The kind of cry when the soul wriggles and leaves the body. This earth does not need him any more. This earth does not need him any more. This earth does not need him any more. There is a time to sow... and a time to reap. There is a time to be born... and a time to die. There is a time to sow... and a time to reap. There is a time to be born... and a time to die. There is a time to sow and a time to reap. There is a time to be born and a time to die. The city is shocked at the murder of Binoy, a prominent businessman. Police is baffled in front of the planning which went behind... ... this murder that happened while lockdown restrictions were in place. Though Hari Bhai a.k.a. Hari is under arrest, Kalidasan who motivated Hari to commit the crime has not been arrested yet. Public has the opinion that it's a serious lapse from the police force. There are police barricades at all exit points. Police are repeating that Kalidasan cannot escape, come what may. IG Hemanth Arora is sharing some shocking and dramatic news right now. It has been proved that Kalidasan used jail inmates... to commit murders in three places in the State. He made the jail inmates commit these murders by getting them released from prison, under the pretext of guiding them to the right path. That too, using three notorious criminals. - Dr. Susan... - Yes. Tell your son... that I am going to give him that car. - Is it? It will be here in my flat, waiting for him. - Oh! I will tell him right away! - Colonel Sir. - Hello. - I need a favor. - What is it? A bottle? No, it's not a bottle. I want a vehicle. - Okay, man. Shocking details regarding a murder in Kochi are breaking out now. Binoy, a prominent business man from the city has been murdered. Police has arrested Hari aka "Hari Bhai" who committed the crime. Hari aka Hari Bhai told the Police that he committed the crime... on behalf of another person. The Investigating Officer stated that Kalidasan, the person who motivated Hari to commit the crime, will be caught soon. Investigation head IG Hemanth Arora said that... two similar murders happened in Thrissur and Palakkad, a few months ago. Here's what he had to say. In fact, I'm the one who enquired about this Thrissur murder case. The criminal acted very brilliantly, over there, as well. The criminal who committed the murder was taken into custody only recently. The information he gave the police... is exactly the same as the information Hari Bhai, the criminal gave, in Kochi. This Kalidasan, whom we mentioned... We are yet to ascertain whether that is his real name or not. In fact... in Kochi, Thrissur, Palakkad... He is known by this name in all these places. Same method, same brainwork. Kalidasan's friend, Yamuna Krishnan is on the line now. Tell us, Yamuna Krishnan. What do you have to say about this? - I am shocked seeing the news. - I can't believe that Das is such a person. - The Das I know is not like this. Dr. Susan Koshy, Kalidasan's neighbour in Thrissur... and a prominent psychiatrist, is joining us now. Tell us, Doctor. How do you know Kalidasan? - I know him as a patient. A patient? - Was Kalidasan one of your patients? - Yes. - Kalidasan was suffering from a mental disorder called Schizophrenia. - Many Schizophrenia patients have a peculiar mindset... - of living in their imaginary world. - They think that things that are not there, exist. - They weave stories with their imagination and live in it. - Das had too much of an attention seeking problem too. - Just like kids, he used to call me all the time to talk about silly stuff. - That's a distinctive trait of this disorder. - Recently, he called me saying that he's hearing voices... - of a mother and daughter in the Kochi flat, where he was staying. - I gave him medicines for that too. Stop it! - But I don't know whether he took it or not. - His last call was just a while ago... - saying that he is ready to give his fancy car to my son. - After that, what I saw was this news. Wasn't it you who arranged this flat for him, Yamuna? - Yes. - Not just the one in Kochi... - It was me who arranged flats for him in Palakkad and Thrissur as well. Something... Something is not right. It's unbelievable. Are murderers people with mental disorders? Joining today's discussion are... prominent psychiatrist, Dr. Indugopan... and investigation expert and former SP Mr. George Thomas. See, Schizophrenia is a disorder... that affects a person's ability... Schizophrenia patients believe things that others consider false, to be true. They hear strange and unfamiliar sounds... and they act based on those things. These are characteristics of patients with Paranoid Schizophrenia. Correcting those who are treading the wrong path. Changing them into good people. Is there any other deed more righteous that this? Muruga! - Sir, is it you? It's me, indeed. Muthukrishnan. - Where are you, sir? It's been so long since I spoke to you. Yes. - Are you doing well? - Yes, sir. Well, I am on the way to your city. - Okay. I know that it's been two months since you got out of prison. - Yes, sir. I need a place to stay over there. - Is it? - Yes. A flat would be perfect. - Correct, sir. Can you check and arrange a flat for me? - Yes, sir.. But... What is it?
