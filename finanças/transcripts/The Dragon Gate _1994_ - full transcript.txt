[gentle music] - [Ken] Ken means the sword, do means the way. Ken-do, the way of the sword. The sword is the living soul of the warrior. There is nothing between heaven and earth that a warrior need fear with such a living soul. [dramatic music] [gentle music] [men shouting] [shouting in a foreign language] [Sensei shouting] Hajumae! [Begin!] [Sensei shouting] Yamae! [Stop!] - Ken, when you come in like that you need to use your hips more, not your arms. [Ken]. Hai! [Yes!] - You need to get in close because in the old days you had to get in close so you could do like this. You see? - [Ken] [speaking in a foreign language] [dramatic music] [Sensei shouting] Yamae! [End Of Match!] ♪ I sit here watching you walk out my door ♪ ♪ We're going through this one more time ♪ ♪ I found I want you more than ever before ♪ ♪ But I just have no more tears left to cry ♪ [dramatic music] [men shouting] [spectators cheering] [tense music] Hajumae! [Begin!] [dramatic music] [men shouting] [shouting in a foreign language] [dramatic music] [speaking in a foreign language] [gentle music] [gentle music] [car horn beeping] [gentle music continues] - Sensei, what is it I have to do to beat this guy? - You have to reach deep down inside. - How do I do that? - You have to select a tutor with inherent wisdom. [dramatic music] [shouting in a foreign language] [men shouting] [dramatic music] [shouting in a foreign language] [suspenseful music] [gentle music] [dramatic music] [men shouting] [speaking in a foreign language] [men shouting] [shouting in a foreign language] [triumphant music] - Very nice match. - Sensei, thank you for teaching me. Sensei, I'm troubled by something. When I'm in a match I seem to disappear into the match. After it's over I can't remember anything that happened. It's as if I wasn't there. It seems natural but is it proper? - That is as it should be. That is the way. To defeat your opponent you must become one with them. - Sensei, how do I cut with the sword if I do not do it? - The sword cuts. - But how do I wait for a cut to happen if I'm no longer there? - Practice, it will happen. Sword, goal, ego, will melt into another one. Take the sword and cut. [gentle music] - Where are you going? - I'm going home. - What? - Well, if I'm gonna be ignored I may as well be at my own house. - Helen, you know I have to be in court tomorrow at 8:30. - I just feel like all we ever do is go to the movies and dinner and go to sleep. - That's not true. - Yeah, it is true. - Last week you wanted to go clubbing. - Yeah, but you wouldn't even dance with me. - I'm just not a dancing kind of guy. - I'm not asking you to marry me, you know. I'm just asking you to spend a little bit of quality time with me. - You know what my life is. You know what I'm trying to accomplish. I'm doing the best I can. - Well you have three nights a week to do Kendo. Why do you have to spend so much time doing that? - It's something I feel very strongly about. When I do Kendo I feel alive, exhilarated. There's something powerful happening and it's so essential to my life. I don't know, I just have this really strong pull to this art. It just feels right. It's like I'm being trained for something. I can feel it but I can't tell you what it is. - I think we've reached the end here Ken. I want you to just think about what I've said and you call me. You know, I think that you're making a really terrible mistake. - Maybe not. - Bye. [bell chiming] [waves crashing] - They say there is a woman with golden hair. The woman in a sheet. I keep looking for her. Maybe she will tell me. - Hey Ken. - How you doing? - Good to see you. - Good. [gentle piano music] - Thank you. - [Ken] You okay? - Yeah, it's just been one of those nights. - I hope it works out okay. - Thanks. - Be careful. - Oh, careful. - What can I get you? - A mineral water, ice with lemon. - I know [indistinct] and I also know he's gonna be back. - Hey! - Excuse me. - You got one of those bodies I'd launch a thousand ships for. - Please. - Well, I guess a blow job's out of the question? - I guess it is. - Honey. I just spoke to the sitter, the kids are fine. We can stay another hour, no problem. - You're messing with my sex life over here, all right? - Excuse us. - Ah, listen, I'm communicating with this woman here. - I think you've had enough. [gentle piano music] - Jack. Jack, Jack, take it easy, man. - I can take him on. [indistinct] - Of all the parties in town and you had to pick this one, huh? I didn't know you were friends with the Walshes? - I do some litigation work for his firm. - You always introduce yourself this way? - No, I made an exception for you. - Pretty quick with your hands I see. - It's all in the eyes. Besides, he was drunk. - You're just saying that. - No, it's true. If you watch an opponent's eyes you can see everything he's gonna do. - So am I one of your opponents? - I'm not sure I know. - Well can't you tell just by looking in my eyes? - They're still beautiful eyes. - Do you wanna dance? - You know I don't dance. - You don't dance or you won't dance? Come on Ken it'll be fun. I won't bite, I promise. - Sorry, I just feel stupid. - Please. So, what's changed then, huh? [dramatic music] [gentle piano music] - Thanks. [upbeat music] - No. No, no, no. [Helen screaming] [man grunting] [man spluttering] [Ken groaning] [man groaning] [dramatic music] [gentle music] - The sound of the drums at The Dragon Gate echo the impermanence of all things. The hues of the flowers in the tea tree declare that those who flourished must be brought alone. - Who are you? - My name is Shin'ichi. Friend, teacher, guide, poet, et cetera. Are you all right? - Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay. - You're looking for something. - Yeah. When I was attacked I was looking for this guy dressed in black. He was with a really pretty blonde woman. They were over there. - I know of whom you speak. - Where'd they go? Was she still with him? - Yes she's still with him. - Damn. Trouble with the ladies, is that it? - Bad judgment. I mean if there was a room full of a hundred women and 99 are right for me and one isn't, I'll pick the wrong one. - Ah, I see. - Did you see them leave? - Not long ago across the Bridge of Lights. - The Bridge of Lights? - The walkway across the ave of the stars in Century City. I know The Shadow. - Who is he? - He will make a very formidable opponent. - Who said anything about fighting? - Your caution is welcome, your wisdom refreshing. But I am not here to teach you. I can only show you the way to your answer. - What is my question? - Prepare your soul. I will wait for you at the Bridge of Lights. [dramatic music] Let me leave you with this. Always move toward the light. - What? - When you cross the vortex you will no longer be able to return. - What do you mean I won't be able to return? - No matter what happens. Unless and until you answer the riddle of the 23 questions. - What is the riddle? - I can't tell you that. The Cloistered Woman can tell you the riddle but don't let her show you her ring of gold. - Ring of gold. Is this the "Legend of Zelda"? - Pay attention. She's treacherous. You have to focus on your goal. You have to concentrate when you meet her or else you'll lose all the desire to complete what it is you started out to do in the first place. Helen will disappear from your memory. The Shadow will escape. - Okay, okay. I think I'm getting this. - You sure? Good. Lastly, let me leave you with these words which may be the greatest gift of all but you have to repeat them continuously. They are very profound and powerful words. You understand? I'll only speak them once so pay attention. You ready? - Yes. Nam Nam Myoho Myoho Renge Renge Kyo Kyo But when do I use them? - Use your inherent wisdom. Farewell. - What's gonna happen? - Just run and you'll find out. - Run? - Run. And something will happen. Run. [tense music] [buzzing] [dramatic music] - You're in good hands. You deserve a break today. [dramatic music] I'd rather fight than switch. Be all that you can be. You got the right one baby. [Ken screaming] [woman screaming] - What the hell's going on here? [Helen screaming] [dramatic music] [tense music] [man shouting] [man groaning] [men shouting] [man groaning] [man shouting] [dramatic music] [man shouting] [dramatic music] [men shouting] [dramatic music] [men shouting] [dramatic music] [gentle music] I am seeking The Cloistered Woman, she has a riddle for me. 23 questions. - Shh. [gentle music] Please refresh yourself. You must be hungry. Please join me in these foods. - I will, but first I must lay down my soul. [gentle music continues] [shimmering music] Will you join me? - Yes, of course I will. [water flowing] [birds tweeting] [upbeat music] Dance with me? - I don't dance. - Oh, they say never give a sword to a man who doesn't dance. Try it. [upbeat music] [dramatic music] [Ken coughing] - Kenny, I can't move your sword. - Well of course you can't, it's my soul. No one can be responsible for someone else's soul. [dramatic music] [water flowing] [birds tweeting] - [Shin'ichi] Ken, I warned you not to look at her ring of gold. If she dies the riddle will be lost forever and you will forget your mission. You will forget everything you set out to do. You will lose all desire to complete your mission. - No. Go away, leave me alone. - Please I've tried everything I can. What else can I do? - Go away. [gentle music] [Shin'ichi speaking in a foreign language] [Ken chanting] Nam myoho renge kyo. - Let's see, how shall I reward you? - What is a riddle of 23 questions? - You remember by my ring. - The illusions are real to those who sleep. We have awakened. I have given you the rarest gift of all, life. Have you no appreciation? - Yes, I am in your debt. - What is the riddle? - It's neither existing nor nonexisting. Without cause or condition. Without self or others. Neither square nor round. Neither short nor long. Without appearance or disappearance. Without birth or death. Neither created nor emanating. Neither made nor produced. Neither sitting nor lying. Neither calm nor quiet. Without advance or retreat. Without safety or danger. Without merit or demerit. [upbeat music] - Neither walking nor stopping. Neither moving nor rolling. Neither calm nor quiet. Without advance or retreat. Ah, I see you found the path of light. - Was it you who spoke the riddle? - I might've said something, I really can't recall. I'm so hungry and tired. - You've just said part of the riddle of 23 questions. - What are you raving about? Nevermind. I'm really too tired to talk. - I can't go back until I answered that riddle. Do you know it? - I'm hungry. - If I get you some food will you tell me the answer to the riddle? - Maybe. - What kind of food do you like? - Careful now. What I say may render you horrified. - Please, just tell me what you want and I'll get it for you. - I drink warm human blood. If you can provide that I will impart such as I know of this riddle. - Teach me the answer to the riddle and I will get you what you want. - Oh no, first you feed me, then I'll talk. Where are you gonna find such food anyway? - Right here, me. I'm still warm. Teach me the answer to the riddle and I'll give you my blood. - Right? I'll teach and then you'll run off and I'll still be hungry. - I've come a great distance to save someone I care a great deal about. If I cannot answer that riddle I will not succeed and my life will be worthless anyway. - Just so, just so. The flowers or the mango tree are many but there are few which turn into fruit. Many people set out to reach their goal but there comes a time when they fail to make sufficient efforts, they get thrown off the track as it were. - Wait, you can't leave. - Warrior, you're on the right track. You're closer than you know. [dramatic music] - [Ken] Helen! Helen! Helen! Helen! Helen! Helen! - You. You. Yes. Yes. [dramatic music] [dramatic music intensifies] [man groaning] [tense music] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [Helen sobbing] - It's okay. It's okay. We're safe. We're safe, okay. We'll be okay. We're safe now. [Helen sobbing] Okay. [whooshing] We'll rest here for a while and then we'll move on. - Do you even know where we are? - Yeah, sort of. I mean, I know how to get home. - How? - Well, we cross the Bridge of Light and I know how to get back there. - What's the matter then? - Well, I can't leave until I answer this riddle of 23 questions. - But you know what the answer is, right? - Shh, it's nothing. - Come on, tell me what it is 'cause maybe I know it. - Okay. It's neither existing or non-existing. Without cause or condition. Without self or others. It's neither round nor square. Neither short nor long. Without appearance or disappearance. Without birth or death. Neither emanating or created. Neither made or produced. - Neither calm nor quiet. Without advance or retreat. Without safety nor danger. Without merit or demerit. - It's neither blue nor yellow. Neither red nor white. Neither this nor that. - Mm. - Neither crimson nor purple. Without variety of color. - Mm-hmm. [dramatic music] - You owe me the answer to the riddle. You can run but you cannot hide. - Run from what? - The answer to the riddle. - I'm not running from anything. I'm still willing to perform as we agreed. I must know the answer to that riddle. - Like I say, you can run but you cannot hide. - Wait. - [Helen] What is it? - Nothing. - Oh, will you stop with this please and just tell me what is going on. - I don't know. I just feel like I'm being driven towards something. - I'm leaving. - Helen, just be patient, I'll get you home. - No, that's okay Ken. I can get myself home, thank you. - Helen. [Helen screaming] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [tense music] [dramatic music] [tense music] [Ken shouting] [men shouting] [men groaning] [dramatic music] [man groaning] [Ken shouting] [dramatic music] [man groaning] [dramatic music] [men shouting] [dramatic music] [man shouting] [tense music] [man shouting] [man groaning] - Ken! [tense music] [dramatic music] [man shouting] [dramatic music] [Ken shouting] [dramatic music] [Ken groaning] [dramatic music] [men shouting] [Helen screaming] [men shouting] [tense music] [Ken groaning] [Helen screaming] [man laughing] [Helen sobbing] [Ken groaning] [Helen sobbing] [man laughing] [Ken groaning] [Helen screaming] [tense music] [Helen screaming] [Ken groaning] [Helen screaming] [Ken groaning] [Helen screaming] - No! [Helen screaming] - I don't. Why her? Why are you doing this? [tense music] [Helen screaming] [tense music] [Helen screaming] [bones cracking] No! [men laughing] [dramatic music] [wind whistling] [dramatic music] [man groaning] [somber music] [dramatic music] [wind whistling] [haunting music] [Ken chanting] Nam myoho renge kyo. [triumphant music] [Ken chanting in a foreign language] - [Shin'ichi] Be holding the thus come one [speaking in a foreign language] sitting in the lions seat. The assembly of heavenly gods, dragon kings, asuras and others constantly reign down upon him with beautiful white Mandara blossoms. As all of us offer to that [speaking in a foreign language] who healed his wounds and at last he was able to attain the highest way. [uplifting music] [Ken chanting in a foreign language] [gentle music] - Let it to be known that the soul is for the purpose of punishing evil. In the hands of a coward nothing will be accomplished. [gentle music] [wind howling] [dramatic music] [gentle music] [uplifting music] [gentle music] [dramatic music] [gentle music] [dramatic music] [dramatic music intensifies] [Ken shouting] [dramatic music continues] [Ken shouting] [dramatic music intensifies] [gentle music] [Ken shouting] [dramatic music] [Ken shouting] [tense music] [tense music intensifies] [dramatic music] [men groaning] [tense music] [Ken shouting] [tense music] [Ken shouting] [Ken groaning] [dramatic music] [men shouting] [assassin groaning] [dramatic music] [Ken shouting] [dramatic music] [assassin shouting] [Ken shouting] [dramatic music] - When the student is ready, the teacher shall appear. Please forgive me for deceiving you. I disguised myself to test your spirit. Plus, it is not so bad being a wolf in this place. What is the nature of these tears? - They're tears of joy. It's as if my life is now a golden one. Me. It's me. That's the answer to the riddle. Me. My life is neither existing nor non-existing. Neither round nor square. Neither short nor long. Without appearance or disappearance. I feel free. I am free. It's as if everything is so clear. I'm in the mind of creation. I know everything. - Those who realize that all phenomena in the physical universe are manifestations of enlightenment have no need for good friends to instruct them. One thinks exactly as the enlightened one thinks, does exactly as he does, speaks as he speaks, acts as he acts. Such a person is free of offenses and hindrances and enjoys complete freedom. Ha. Will you stay here or return? - I have to go back. - But you could stay here and enjoy your enlightenment for eternity. - But that's not the Warrior's way. If I don't return then everything I've learned will be wasted. - Thus it is so. [gentle music] Those who visit this place can instantly rid themselves of the sins they have committed since the infinite past and transform their illusions into wisdom, their error into truth and their suffering into freedom. In China there is a waterfall called The Dragon Gate. Its waters plunge a hundred feet, swifter than an arrow shot by a strong archer. It is said that thousands of carp gather in the basin below hoping to climb the falls and that any which succeeds will turn into a dragon. However, not a single carp out of a hundred, a thousand or even 10,000 can climb the falls not even after 10 or 20 years. Some are swept away by the strong currents, some fall prey to eagles, hawks, kites and owls, and others are netted, scooped up or even shot with arrows by fishermen who line either bank of the wide falls. Such is the difficulty a carp faces in becoming a dragon. Life is just like the waterfall, it's always a struggle and if you don't keep fighting you get dragged away by the currents or caught by the fishermen. Each of us has a mission to attain enlightenment or happiness. The eagles, hawks, owls and fishermen represent the diluted desires, greeds and demons of our own creation that test and tempt us off the track to our happiness. Death is inevitable but one's happiness and enlightenment are eternal. There are no accidents in life, everything happens for a reason. Every event is a gift to teach us and it is with that understanding that we must live our lives. - Hey Ken. - How you doing? - Good to see you buddy. - Having a good time? - Oh, a great time. If you're looking for Helen she's inside. - Oh really? - Enjoy. - Okay. [upbeat music] Hi. - Hi. - Shall we dance? - You're sure? - I'm sure. - Okay. Let's dance. [upbeat music continues] [gentle music] - I am the warrior. I am the [speaking in a foreign language]. Lifetime after lifetime. I have always been the [speaking in a foreign language]. I am ever vigilant. I have climbed The Dragon Gate. [gentle music continues] [tense music]
