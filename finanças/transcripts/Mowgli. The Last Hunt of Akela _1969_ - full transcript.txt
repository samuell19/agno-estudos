Butyrina The preceding chapters were about the little boy Mowgli who was adopted by a pack of wolves and learned the Laws of the Jungle; and about his friends and enemies. I am surprised that such brave hunters let themselves be led by a dying wolf. I heard that at the Pack Council you do not dare to look him in the eye. The Master of the Jungle! He has probably eaten the man's cub. Of course he needs a rest. Mowgli? I will devour that little frog. How strange to see at your feet something that used to cover your head. Do you like my new clothing? It is beautiful. That's nothing. You should see it after a bath. Let's go for a swim then. Wait. I am full. I am lazy. Then I will carry you. Hold on. Watch out! That's it. I'll show you. The shoulder! The arm! The knee! The head! The leg! The stomach! The chest! And now let's go for a swim, Kaa! Well, what do you think? No, show me your whole body. Kaa! You have grown. You are agile and clever. And yet that is not enough. I am strong. No. You have weak claws and teeth. Who should I be afraid of? Shere Khan. You need an Iron Tooth. An Iron Tooth? Yes. I know where to find it. What's all this for? Are these good to eat? Calm down, Mother Cobra. Calm down. This man is my brother. All right, all right. What of the big city up there? The jungle is above our heads. The city is long gone. It was destroyed when my grandfather was still young. Ah, yes, yes. I am very old. But still I cannot believe that the great city has disappeared. Crawl up there, and you'll see it with your own eyes. You are too young to teach me! I am the guardian of these treasures. and I will not leave them even for an instant. But we do not want anything here. Except maybe this Iron Tooth. Mother Cobra, gift it to me, and I will bring you frogs to eat. Of course, of course. I will give you all that you see here! But only while you are here. Thank you, Mother Cobra. Look around you. What is that there, eh? Those men came to take the treasure away. I spoke to them, and they-- But we do not need your treasure. Besides, I know the Master Word. There is only one master word here. It is mine! No man has walked out of here alive. Get back, or I'll touch your neck! Let her go, Kaa. She has outlived her poison. Rotted-out tree stump. Your treasure needs a new guardian. l am ashamed. Kill me! Ah... it is lovely here. Ha! This is brighter than Bagheera's eyes. I am sorrowful to my tail's tail that that rotted-out tree stump scared me so much. Will you hunt with me today? I don't know how to thank you for this thing, but forgive me, I have to see Bagheera. I have to show her the Iron Tooth. Where have you been? We have been looking for you. Quickly, let's go hunting. Hey, beasts, listen all and spread the word! Now the little frog has a fearful Iron Tooth! Flowers, vines and leaves of the Jungle, the song of triumph sings to you Mowgli. Run, flock of monkeys, like a frightened mob. Take care now, Shere Khan, not to cross my path. Mowgli! Mowgli! Akela, let Mowgli go with us today. With us. Good hunting. Where did you get that? In the Cold Caves. Kaa helped me. Now I have no one to fear. Right, Bagheera? While we are with you, you have nothing to fear. But there is one thing in the world that is stronger than the Iron Tooth. The Red Flower. The Red Flower? The Red Flower. Everyone fears it. Even you? Yes, even I. And I. Even Baloo, and Kaa, and Shere Khan. They are chasing a deer. They are chasing it towards us. No, they are chasing it along a different path, towards the water! Let Akela show his strength. Make room for the leader of the pack! Spring, Akela! Aha! The old wolf has missed! Akela has missed! Akela has missed! There, beyond the river, near the Valley of the Reeds, lives the Red Flower. It can be small and shy like a moth, but if you anger it, it becomes strong; it grows taller than the trees; and then there is no escaping from it. Wake up, Mowgli! Wake up! Akela has missed. The pack needs a new leader. To the Council Rock! No time to waste now. Run, run, Mowgli! Quickly, get the Red Flower before it is too late. Quickly! Akela has missed. What does the Law say He is a Dead Wolf We need to choose a new leader. For twelve years I have led you in the hunt. You, Grey Brother, run to the Rock. And you wait for me here. Now I have missed my kill. By Law, you have the right to kill me. Therefore I ask: who comes to end the life of the Lone Wolf? We are of one blood, you and I. Hurry, hurry, Mowgli! Don't waste time with this old fool. He will die anyway. Gve me the man's cub! - Right. - What has the man to do with us? He is our brother. He has driven game for us. Shere Khan is right. Give the man to him. Give him up. Give him up. Let him go. Now we can do no more except fight. He is my brother. He is my brother. Stop! Does Shere Khan lead the pack? Are you all jackals, to fawn on him? Silence, man's cub! It smells like rotting flesh here. You have told me so often that I am a man that I began to believe it. And so that you may see it better, here! Take this! You said you would kill me. Up, when a man speaks! This is for Akela! This is for man! For Akela! For man! Go now, singed jungle cat. Now listen to me. Akela has missed because of Shere Khan and you will not kill him. He will remain the leader of the Pack. It is I who says this-- Mowgli, a man. This is the third of the Mowgli stories. (subtitles from FBJ, edited by Niffiwan)
