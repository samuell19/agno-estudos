(jazz music) (film rolling) (jazz music) (somber music) - Look at it from the bright side Desa Rae. For the past six months, this has been a long and tedious divorce process. This settles the deal. Aside from one real estate deal still pending, everything else is done. Just read it and sign by the tabs. - Thanks for everything. Let me know when the rest of the paperwork comes. Maybe Reggie's attorney will get them to us soon. - It's over, hon. Listen, that in and of itself should put a smile on your face. - [Desa Rae] Thanks. - At least you're getting alimony and, and, some of that money that Reggie's getting from those properties he was hanging on to. - That might sound good to you, but all I ever wanted was a faithful husband. That was just too much to ask. Thanks. (somber music) - Oh, oh, my God. Thank you. - You're welcome. - There you go. - it got it, thanks. - Give me a second to talk to her, okay? I'll be there in a minute. - Okay, baby. - Mm-mm. - Mm. - Hello. We're not talking to each other anymore? Is that what's going on? - If it pertains to Latrel, then yes. And what are you calling me for anyway, Reggie? You got what you wanted, that's pretty obvious. - We both got what we needed. I'm sorry it had to be this way.

Listen, I been standing here for almost two fuckin' hours and these niggas still ain't done with my car. - Craig, do me a favor, man.

Listen, I need to get to work by two, so you need to really be quick. - First of all, nothing I do is quick. I'll make sure you get to work on time. Matter of fact. Yeah, I'm a need a car. Nah, yeah, that's cool. All right. My boy's gonna be here in five minutes. - No, no, no, that's okay, you don't have to do that. - I insist, all right. Just go ahead and sit over there.

Look, there is something I do want from you. - Oh, what's that? - Your name. - (laughs) Desa Rae, why? - All right, Desa Rae. So maybe I can get your number, take you out to dinner? The movies? - No, no, I don't think so. - Hold up. That's how you gonna treat a nigga who fixed your shit? - No, you should never classify yourself as the N word and as for me rewarding you for an oil change, that's not gonna happen. Besides, how old are you anyway? - Aw, shit, I'm 29, how old are you? - My age don't matter, so. - Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to figure out why you ashamed to tell me how old you are. - Ashamed? - Yeah. - You old as fuck. - Give me my ID. - Let me get out your way. Damn. - My door. - I hate to see you go, but you know you fine as hell, right? - Listen, but you know what? - What's that? - There's something you can do for me. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. - [Roc] What's that? - I need you to fire Bud. He's bad for business. - I hate walking around like a bitter bitch, but whenever I think about Reggie and dealing with this divorce and how he played me, it just irks my soul. - You know what? After 20 years together, you have every right to be mad. Okay, he cheated on you. But it's time for you to move on. You can't keep on being bitter. You say it don't bother you, but clearly it did. What you can control, though, is how you handle it. You gotta go out. Latrel is in college now. This is the perfect time for you. - Girl, please, I am not a partier. You know I like to stay at home with my peaceful books and my cuddle bed. - Boring. Listen, come out with me tonight to this birthday party. And it'll only be for a few hours and after that I promise you you can get back to your books and your Tinder and whatever happened to that guy you were talking to? - Oh, Marcus, yes. I still talk to him, but I don't know. Something's off with him. I think he's hiding something. - You always got an excuse, girl. Get it together and come out with me tonight. I promise you you gonna have a good time. - Okay, fine, just send me the location, I may surprise you. - All right, Ms. Bougie. I'm a send it to you now. I hope I see you later. - [Desa Rae] Bye.

I know where to find you. - [Monica] I wanna feel it. Dang, where'd he go? - Desa Rae Jenkins. I called you four times today and you have not answered your phone. Why are you playing games? You know we have to finalize this situation with the rental property. - I don't have to answer your calls, Reggie. That's what we got attorneys for. - You know it's clear that you tryna be a pain in my ass. All you have to do is sign this one piece of paper. My attorney's gonna be out of town for weeks. I need this done today. - No, no, no, no, no. I'm not signing anything until my attorney has plenty of time to look over the paperwork. And I'm sorry that you're upset that I didn't call you, but do you remember a time when you didn't answer my calls because your little heifer was annoyed? As I said before, it it pertains to Latrel or my alimony check, which by the way hasn't hit my account. Where's my money, Reggie? - Desa Rae, this is complicated, okay. I am trying. Lord knows I'm trying. But I need you to be patient with me, okay? You already have the house. My financial situation is not as secure as it used to be, all right? Now I need you to sign off on this one last piece of property and I promise you gonna get what's due to you. But I need you to stop being mad at me for walking out on marriage that was failing for years. - No, it failed because you got caught cheating and you're little heifer is the one who told me she was pregnant by you. - Oh. - You know, give me your little funky paper. Uh-uh. Turn around. Here. Happy? - Yes, was that so hard. - Leave me alone. - Yo, what's up with you, girl? Give me my bear. - Your bear? - Yeah, my bear, you bought it. - Yeah, I did buy it. - For me. - It's my bear. - Exactly. - Did you tell your mom yet? - I sent her a message. I need to call her for real. (phone rings) - Hello? - Hey, Ma, did you get my message? - No, I haven't checked my messages yet. - Well, I was just calling to let you know that I probably won't be able to come home this weekend or even next weekend. - What? Latrel, are you serious? - Come on now, baby. I went to the grocery store and I bought all this stuff and I have tickets for tonight. You sure you can't come? - Yeah, I'm sure, Mom, I'm sorry. I messed up on this test and I need to retake it. - Well, your butt is lucky he's letting you take it over again so you better do good on it this time. And I guess I'll just save all this stuff. - All right, Ma, I love you. - [Desa Rae] All right, I'll talk to you later. - See you. - Why you laughing like that when I'm on the phone with my mom. - I messed up on a test. - Man, everything was smooth the other day. Shit, from what I heard probably was dope as fuck. I just wish we had a chance to make bigger moves in LA. You know DJ talkin' about the feds ready to make some moves, so look like we gotta lie low on this here for a minute. - Yeah, but you can't trust everything that nigga say. Nah. Send Gage and Butch down there. Let them see what's going on. 'Cause I need you to keep your hands as clean as possible. Listen, nephew, I ain't never gave a fuck about them other niggas out there. But you, you my fam. So you know I got to have your back, right? - Yeah, you know I got your back, too, right, Unc. - For shit loads. - But you know what? I think I am gonna send Gage and Romo. Butch been acting funny. I don't know what's going on with him, but I got my eyes on him just in case some shit go down. - See, that's what you gotta do. You got to watch these motherfuckers, Roc. I know they your boys and everything, but I don't fuck with none of them. See, I don't let niggas get too close to me and you shouldn't either. Always keep them niggas at a distance. Don't never let them motherfuckers forget that without me and you, they wouldn't be shit. Never let 'em forget that shit. - Girl, listen, I told you that what happened, didn't I? Didn't I tell you that was gonna happen? You be playin' too much. - Bitch, you loud as hell. Why don't you take that shit the fuck outta here. Don't you see us in here talking? You need to have some respect. - Wait, who you calling a bitch and respect you for what? Who the hell is you? Yeah, a nobody, girl, you know this motherfucker. - Who am I? Who am I? Bitch, I'm glad you asked. You see I'm the motherfucker who pays your bills. As a matter of fact, I'm the motherfucker responsible for keeping your son in private school. Now the real question is, who the fuck are you besides some slick talking bucket head bitch who happened to get pregnant by my nephew. - Let me call you back. Roc! Are you handling this shit or should I? - Shit, first of all your ass was being rude. Being loud as fuck. Man, look, I don't mind fighting your battles for you, but this time, yeah, you on your own. - Well, ain't that a bitch. Fuck you and fuck you, too. Come on, Lamar, get your shit together, let's go. They being disrespectful and I'm a hurt somebody. - He ain't going nowhere. I'm a bring him home later on. - I'm not doing this shit with you. - See, what I think about that, I told you. You better pump your motherfuckin' brakes. - Roc. - I'm tired of your shit right now. - Chill out, dawg. - Get the fuck outta here. - Get the fuck up outta here, man. You already doing this shit. - Fuck you. - What's going on with you? - I told you about that. - Man, if you don't get up outta here, he gonna hurt you. Man, leave. We'll talk later. - Man, look, you need to get rid of that bitch, I'm telling you. She's disloyal and disrespectful and I don't tolerate that shit, Roc. - Yeah, that makes two of us. You all right, man? - You all right. - You good, man. - Man, you all right, right? - Yeah, I'm good. - You just pop up on people. - Yeah, what you over here doing? - What are you doing? - Shit, I came to check up on you. - Well, I got a lot going on. I got a leaky faucet and I've gotta clean up this garage so I don't have time to talk. - I mean, I ain't no plumber, but let me help you out with that. Look, matter of fact, how about we make a bet? - What? - If I don't finish in an hour, you gotta let me take you to dinner. - [Desa Rae] Okay, well, if I win, I get to choose. - Come on. - Let's go. - No, I told you he just showed up. But I'm so glad he did because Reggie said he'd fix the faucet and you know how that is and Latrel canceled. I don't even know what's gotten into him. - It's called growing up and living your best life, girl. Let it go. He'll come home when he's ready to. And as for Reggie's sorry ass, whatever. It's probably better that he wasn't even there. I can only imagine what Roc is looking like right now. - Oh, my God, he's so beautiful. He got all these tattoos on his chest and his back. But, girl, I definitely know why they call him the Roc. I felt that the other day. - [Monica] Send me a picture. - A picture? Okay, wait, wait, I gotta sneak it. - [Monica] Girl, damn, come on, hurry up and send that picture. Got me over here like a damn . (camera clicks) (phone dings) - Mm. Lord have mercy. I'm about to pass the hell out. Girl, what are you gonna do with all of this? Please tell me and do not continue to waste that man's time. I know how you operate, girl. - I will take that as a compliment. I don't know what I'm gonna do with him. He's so young. But, I mean, I don't know. Maybe we can be friends. - [Monica] That all depends on what you want from him. I mean, personally I think you're just wasting his time, but what I do suggest is you get off the phone right now and start to get to know him a little better and by next week, I need to know what that sex is like on a scale of 1 to 10. All right, gotta go, bye. - Talk to you later, bye. You done? - Yeah, man, that faucet wore me out. - I see. So, I knew this was gonna take longer than an hour. - I mean, it barely took over an hour, but I mean, I did lose the bet. - Yes. - So I'll do whatever you want. - Anything? - Anything. - Okay. - All right, so after you take a shower, I can get you some clothes from my son's room and then we can go out. - From your son's room? - Yeah, from my son's room. - Yeah, no, I got some clothes in the car. - Oh. - It'll be all right. - You keep clothes in the car? - Yeah, better than your son's room. - Just hurry up. (bright music) - This is crazy. I can't believe you got me to come to some shit like this, man. I should have thrown a suit on or something. Oh, you look fine. You lost a bet so suck it up. You enjoy it. I saw it. - Man, you gotta be like the only black person I know to come to some shit like this. - No, my son loves it and I saw you, too. You like it. - Man, look, the only way I'm a like this is if Drake or Hole shows up- - Drake. - And you know that's not happening. - Whatever. So, maybe next time you could take me into your world. - My world? - Yeah. - You better be careful what you wish for. - Okay. Thanks again for going with me to the musical. I know you didn't wanna go, especially since your butt fell asleep. - Man, I did fall asleep, man. - Yes, you did. - But you know I used to always go to 'em growing up. - Yeah? - Yeah, my grandma, she used to always take me. Then, but life happens and, shit, here I am. - Yeah. Life does happen and if you ever wanna talk about it, I'm here. - Shit, what I wanna talk about is up inside. - Yeah, I bet you do. - No, I'm tired. I had a good time, but maybe next time the plans are on you, okay? Goodnight, Roc. Roc, come on now. Don't do that stuff around here, Roc. Roc, the police are really active, so be easy.

See, that's why I stop fuckin' with your ass. Always acting like a little kid and shit. - Since when did you stop fuckin' with me, Roc. What, two minutes ago? - Come on now. I just got a phone call. Maybe it was something urgent, man. - Fuckin' me is urgent. But you need to take me somewhere special and start treating me more like royalty. - Come on, girl, you are royalty. - Yeah, okay. - And fucking you is always urgent. - Mm. - Come on. - Let me do it. I been waiting weeks for this. Damn. - You are a life saver, girl. I've been sitting on this paperwork for weeks and Latrel needed it ASAP. - Well, you know, you'll be right on time. No worries, plus we all know you been really busy with Mr.- - I only saw him one time this week. He's supposed to come out here later today for dinner, but I don't really feel like cooking. I think I'm gonna order some Chinese. - Ooh, Chinese. You know I'm always hungry. That sounds good. - Reggie, what are you doing here? - Hey, relax, all right. I was gonna knock, but since I had my key I decided to let myself in. Just came by to drop off your check. - Oh, yes. - Ooh, a check. - God is good, won't he do it all the time. - Girl, I'll give you a call tomorrow. - Yeah, good luck with that one. - Right. - [Monica] Bye, Reggie. - Goodbye, Monica, stay prayerful. - Excuse me? What are you doing? - Getting something to drink. - No, you need to call before you come, knock when you get here and you can't just go in my refrigerator getting whatever you want. - You are always complaining. Can we ever just get together without you griping about this or that. - Oh, uh-uh. (doorbell rings) Hold that thought. Let me get that. It's probably Monica. Oh my God, you're early, really early, I said eight, not six. - Nah, you said six. I mean, I'm a little late, but, who's car is that? - Um, that's my ex-husband's car. He shouldn't be long, but you think you can come back at eight? - You must be one of Latrel's friend. - Oh, yeah, this is one of Latrel's friends. He just stopped by to see if Latrel was here. It's one of his workout buddies from the gym. - Yeah, yeah, I used to work out with him. It's nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you, too. What'd you say your name was again? - Roc. - Roc. - Yeah. - I'll be sure to tell Latrel when I see him in a couple of weeks. - Definitely. - Right. - Thanks for stopping by. (engine revs) - Well, it's time for me to go, as well. But came by to drop off your check and let you know that I really do appreciate you whether you know it or not. - Well, thanks for coming by, Reggie. - You're welcome. - Have a good day. (soulful music) (doorbell rings) God, I'm so glad you came. I had no idea my ex was gonna pop over here so I mean, biggest apology. He just popped up unannounced and just came and walked in the refrigerator, but I told you hey, nuts. You just gonna stare at me? You not gonna say anything? - Girl, you promised me dinner, right? Yo, where's my food at? - I got us some Chinese food. I ordered food so we could eat. - Man, I don't even eat Chinese food. Shit, you told me to come here at six, right? - No, I told you eight and everybody eats Chinese food. I had no idea my ex was gonna come by here. - [Roc] Right, probably too busy fuckin' that nigga, right? - Okay, I don't like your attitude so if you came over here just to argue, you can just go, rise up, you just go. - Mm-mm. - Stop, Roc, wait, stop.

I've even seen some fast like around two of the spots that Uncle Ronnie connects be at. Somebody snitchin' for sho for sho. Man, we just been low key for two motherfuckin' long for that shit to do down like that. Plus, we got police on payroll. That shit shouldn't be happening, man. - Nah, not really. I mean, we got some of 'em, but not all of 'em. - Look, Roc, maybe we should just chill for right now, you know. Like shut the shop down for a little bit. Just until all this shit blow over. Maybe. We'll see what's up. I'll take to my uncle, see what he's talking about. I'll keep y'all posted. 'Cause if the feds that close to the connect, it's just a matter of time before they making a move. - Shit, maybe for all of us.

I mean, you got this whole vibe like something bothering you, like what's good? - Man, look. I just feel like something big's about to change. And I just can't tell if it's good or bad. - Okay. Something as far as what? You afraid something's gonna happen to you? You referring to us. I'm asking you this because you don't touch me no more and when we have sex, you just bust your nut and call it a day. It never used to be like that, Roc. Talk to me, please, like. Is there somebody else? - Man, come on, there's always somebody else. Man, you know that. Look, you told me as long as I take care of you and little Roc, that's the only thing that matter, right? I mean, those are your words, not mine, right? - I know what I said. But that's when I felt like I had your heart and I don't have it no more, do I? - Look, they only person I love is that little boy running around here, all right? I mean, I appreciate you for bringing him into this world, but listen, don't start complaining now. All right, you got everything you need around here. - I'm still your baby moms. It don't matter who you with. (phone rings) Hey, you busy? I'm a need you to look into something for me. All right, all right, bye. - You stay spoiling me, man.

'Cause, I mean, that shit just sound corny as fuck. - Okay, so- - I mean, the only other thing I could think of is you be my peace, I'll be your happiness. - I like that, peace and happiness. - You like that? - I like it. Okay, so the woman that's giving you peace wants to know what do you do when you're not here and why have you never invited me to my place and where are your parents? I got questions, I wanna know. - Yeah. Uh, I don't know. You know I lost both my parents, right? - No. - Yeah, I lost my mom around the age of six. Yeah, she was a drug addict. My pops, he was locked up ever since I was like seven years old. But, with my Uncle Ronnie, though, yeah. He's the one who raised me. - Yeah? - Yeah, he's cool as hell. You gotta meet him one day. - I'd like to. So, what is it you do? - Ah, man, look, I just shake and move, you know, that's it. - Well, I'm sorry to hear about your parents. I lost my parents, too. It hurts. If you ever need to talk about it, I'm here. You know I'm always here. - Yeah, look. - But, no, no, no. I need to understand what's this shaking and moving thing. What does that mean? - Shaking and moving. It just means I got a few people that work for me, that's it. - No, no, what does that, is what you do legal? Do you kill people or- - Shh. - Or should I be worried about any- - Shh. Why you asking all these questions, baby?

But you can't be around this. This is not you. When it comes to somebody like Roc, this is his lifestyle. This is who he is. A lot of time women, we think we can change man. We think we can come in, fix them up, that's not workin' like that. You don't need to even be in the environment, okay.

I don't want somebody that goes around high all the time and hoses people. And anybody that has a mentor like your Uncle Ronnie can't do nothing for me. I think you should just go. Who are you, Roc? And what do you want from me? Are you some kind of kingpin? - No, man, I need you to save me. I need you to save me from all this bullshit. - Listen, I swear you have so much potential, but I don't know who that was at your birthday party. Who was that? - I mean, tell me what you looking for.

Damn, girl. You know I got you, right? - You promise? - I promise, man. For real, look, whatever you need. All right? Oh, shit. How you feeling? - I'm scared. I mean, we haven't been cool, Roc. And I didn't even think I could get pregnant. - Damn, girl, hey, I'm a buy whatever you need. Where's that bag at? All this shit up in there, hell, yeah. Come on. - I know you're worried, but I'm happy for you and Roc. There's something about him that I like, even though he definitely got some issues. - Yeah, I like him a lot, too, but, unfortunately, we're just two broken people trying to make it whirl. You know, I didn't even think I could get pregnant. Can you imagine how surprised I was? - Mm-hmm, well, you know what? There's nothing you could do now but have that beautiful baby for the both of y'all and I am so excited, you know. I'm a spoil that child so much. I already went shopping. Check it out. - Oh, my God, thank you so much. You know, I'll take it over to his penthouse tomorrow. Can you believe I've never been to his penthouse? I've been kind of reluctant about going all in with him. - Well, I can't really blame you for that. I mean, he's got something more going on that we don't even know about, so you do have to make sure that you're good. - Yeah. - I want the father of my baby to be all that he can be and Roc has told me about his broken childhood, lives in the streets and he talked about getting his GED. You should see this playhouse he built for the baby. It looks like a palace. It's so cute. He's so good with his hands. It has these trellises and- - Ooh, girl. - Shut up. - You got me up in here about to cry. But you know what, some real shit. Roc's backstory is really the story of so many people in our community. A lot of these young boys are just lost. You know, they don't know how to love. They just trying to survive day by day and also protect themselves. So I'm really hoping this baby changes things for Roc. Yeah, I hope so, too. I just gotta figure out how I'm gonna tell Latrel. I don't even think he knows I'm dating somebody. I'm sure Reggie's nosy butt said something. - Girl, do Reggie still be popping up on you? - No, I haven't seen him since the time he busted in on Roc and I. I guess that prompted him to hurry up and get married. - He really went through with it? - I don't know and I don't have time to care. I'm over Reggie and I'm so happy I can finally say that. - Girl, I know that's right. - No Reggie. (doorbell rings) Hey. - What's going on. - You finally made it through, huh? - Oh, what? Oh, my God, Roc. I am shocked. I had no idea your place looked like this. And this looks nothing like the mechanic shop you call your castle. - First of all, the shop is my castle. All right, and before you say anything, you already know, I was about to raw somethin' up. - Whatever, Roc. You can have your little weed. Anyway, just know that smoking is not good for the baby. - Man, I ain't never known a baby to come out high. I'll make sure I keep my distance, though. So, is it a boy or a girl? - I don't know yet. But I don't care. As long as the baby looks like you, I'm good. - And you already know as long as she looks like you, I'm good, too. - Well, I have something for you. First, this one is from Monica. There you go, hold it up. Hold it so I can read it, yeah. My mommy is sweet, that's me, but watch out for my dad, 'cause he gotta watch out for you. - Man, y'all be wildin', for real. Tell her I said thank you. - I'll tell her. All right, now this one is from me. - Okay. - Just trying to help you out. - See. "The Pleasures of Loving." Hold on, you think that Roc Double D Dawson needs help with this? Come on, man. - Did you see the book? I'm just trying to help. I'm just trying to help. Well, okay, wait. So I got this one to make you laugh, but this is one I really wanna give to you. - Man, I could really use this. - You like it? - Yeah, I do, thank you. - Good. All right, so, I wanna see the rest of the place. - Come on. - You show me where the magic happens. - Right up here. - This way? - Yeah. I swear, after looking at this book, it looks a lot harder than I thought, but I'm a definitely put some time aside, make sure I study for this thing. Well, you know, I'm here for you if you need to study. - Yeah, but. - I can help. You ever thought about opening a construction business? What you did with our daughter's playhouse, you got skills. - Oh, you like that? - Yeah, I like it. - It's crazy just because I've always meant to be an artist, though. You know I like to draw. - There you go again. - I'm serious, man. - You're serious. - Yeah, you don't think I could draw? - No. - You know the art gallery that we went to? - Yeah. - You know that's my piece, right? - Roc, no. No, way. I know that you didn't do that. Man, look, let me show you something. (Desa Rae laughs) - Whoa. Oh, my God, are you serious? - You like that? - Roc, this is stunning. Can I keep it? - Hell, yeah, man, you know you can have whatever you want. - What I want, I want love, peace and happiness. I know that's what you want, too. - Yeah, you know I got you, right? - You better. - [Man On TV] This is my damn money and I do exactly what I please. - What up, Unc. - The shit done finally hit the fan, Roc. Them motherfuckers are coming for me. And this time I can't do shit about it. Now I've already talked to Clint down at the station. Them motherfuckers want me to turn myself in and do the time. But look at me. I'm an old man now and time ain't on my side. Fact is, a motherfucker could die in that motherfucker, man. - Come on, Unc, you know it ain't going down like that. Everything you did for these dudes in this community, what about the kids at the rec center. And Clint's fat ass, all that money that you put into his pocket, man, come on, dawg. What about Congressman Jerry? I know there's something he can do. He can only do so much, Roc. Especially since the shit coming from the top. The motherfuckers just jealous, man. I'm making too much money. I got too big. And they not gonna stop until they get me and if not me, the next nigga in charge and that will be you. - Man, look. Whatever you need, just let me know, all right. - I need you to take the fall and do the time. (dramatic music) (Roc knocking) ♪ It feels so right ♪ And I will take this opportunity ♪ - You're late, real late. But I'm so glad you're here, come on. I'll do it. Listen, I have a surprise for you. Let me show you. Ta-da, you like it? - Aw, man, this is dope. - Yeah? - Yeah, but why you throw it up so early, though? Thanksgiving ain't what, for another couple weeks? - I know it's early, but I'm excited about little Roc coming over for Thanksgiving dinner. He's still coming, right? - Man, I thought he was, but I don't think Vanessa's having it. You know I be just trying to keep the confusion down. - All right, I'm sure I'll see him at same point. - But nah, come over here. I just wanna talk to you. You look tired. You want me to get you something. I can go grab you something. Nah, I'm straight. I just wanna talk to you for a little bit. - Okay. You all right? - Yeah, um, looks like some things are going on with the business. And my Uncle Ronnie, it looks like he's gonna get caught up with the feds, so they ready to make some move. - Well, I know you don't wanna hear me say this about your uncle, but he deserves everything he has coming to him. That man is evil. One day you're gonna see he's done more bad in your life than good, Roc. - I keep trying to tell you, if it wasn't for him I probably wouldn't even be here. - Okay, I get it, there's another side, but- - Nah, but. - Wait, what are you trying to say? What is it? - Looks like I might be going away for a little bit. - Going away? Going away where, Roc? What are you talking about? Please don't tell me you're saying what I think you're gonna say. - Man, I don't think my uncle could do 5 to 10 years. - 10 years? 10 fucking years, are you kidding me, Roc? Roc, I'm pregnant with our baby. You won't even be here when she's born. She won't even know who you are, Roc. - You saying it's a girl? - Yeah, a beautiful baby girl and her photo and some stupid stuff is in this stupid box. I can't believe I been so stupid. No, don't you baby me. You need to go with your Uncle Ronnie because I know he's behind this. Get outta here. (somber music) - Dawg, why the fuck you brought us here, dawg. - Shit. - Look, though, what happened though. So the bill come. Motherfucker like almost $400. - [Man 2] Four what? Damn. - Girl bought about like 10 Long Islands. A surf and turf. Shit, but I ain't trippin', though. You know I was for the fuck. (all chattering) So I go for my bread. I don't even know where my loaf at. I had to think like I must have left it in my other shooter. So I'm like, hey, I'm telling her like hey, shawty, just pay the bill. Talking how you old broke ass nigga. I knew you y'all didn't, you a loser. All right, hey, bitch, I- (gun cocks) - Hold up, nah, we good. - I gotta ask you. Why does everyone treat you like you're some kingpin? What the hell is this? - Sit down. I ain't talked to you all week. How you feeling? - Awful. I came here to see if you changed your mind or if I could help you change it. - Well, I don't know if there's anything you could do. The trial's already set to start next week. I'm gonna spend as much time with you as I can. - No. No, that's only gonna make it worse. Look, I don't think you realize how hard this is, Roc. Our daughter won't even know you. She deserves to be raised by her father. Do you realize by doing this, you're choosing your Uncle Ronnie over your children. - Man, you don't get it. Look, my kids are already taken care of, all right. Just like you will. - And you don't get it, Roc. I don't want your money. I don't need it. Roc, I need you, please baby, don't do this. I'm begging you, Roc. - Why, 'cause you love me? What, do you love me? - Stop, I don't know. I don't know. I only loved one man and that was my husband. I've never even been with another man until I met you. - Look, if anything changes, I'll let you know. I can't make any promises. - Baby, you keep saying that I'm different and I am. Look at me, Roc, please. When you say that you want me to save you, save you from what? - Man, save me from myself. - Okay. Okay, well, so let me do it, please, babe. Give us more time, Roc. I know you want this and I know you need this, please. - Look, I know what I need. I also know what I don't need, all right. If anything changes, I'll let you know. (phone buzzes) (Desa Rae cries) - [Gunman 1] You should kill that bitch ass nigga now, man. - [Gunman 2] You better not move. (dramatic music) - All right, what the fuck is this, dawg. I'm already having a bad ass day. - Caught this nigga creeping around outside. You know you been looking for him since that incident with your bread. - [Gunman 1] Maybe you can ask this nigga why he feel brave enough to come around here. - Roc, I swear I didn't take the money. I swear I didn't. Tell these fools we good. We good, ain't we? That's why I'm here so we can talk about this shit. Fuck that nigga, man. - See that's the problem, though. I'm already done talking about this shit. - Please don't do nothing you gonna regret. I got kids. My daughter birthday next week. I didn't take the money. I could take you to the niggas who did and I could make sure you get all your money back. - This nigga lying, Roc. I'm telling you. - Dumb motherfucker. I already got my money back, all 100 Gs, plus some. - So we good. - Yeah, we good. Matter of fact. (gun cocks) Nigga, what day is your daughter birthday on? - It's on Wednesday. - And what's her favorite color? - Purple. - Nigga, who the fuck you yelling at? Matter of fact, Craig, on Wednesday, won't you go find a nice little purple teddy bear for this nigga. Deadbeat ass nigga. Shit, my pops died when I was seven, too. Must be some lucky kind of number or whatever, right? - Fall back, nephew. Don't waste no bullets on this nigga. We got bigger fish to try. Besides, I got a lot of heat on me now, so I don't need no messy shit going on, Roc. So tuck your toy and let this shit go. - Guess, it's your lucky day, right. - [Victim] Thank you, you not gonna regret this. - Shit, we all lucky. And how many times I gotta tell you niggas who's in charge around here. Shit like this don't go down unless I say so, so squash this shit and let's go. You two, Craig, with your simple-minded ass. - Yeah, you might be the one in charge around here, Unc, but I'll make the decisions for this motherfucker. (gun fires) All right, clean this shit up. - Fuck this nigga. - I'm just glad I didn't go through with that wedding. You know, she lied to me about having an abortion? I'm not not happy with our relationship. - When you said you had something to talk about, I thought it was about Latrel. Is this what you came over here to talk to me about? - I came by to see how things were coming with your job. Latrel told me you got laid off. You doing okay financially? - Yes, I'm fine and when I need some extra money I will get another job. In case Latrel told you also, I'm going up to see him this weekend and Monica's gonna go with me. - That's cute. Is your little thug passion boyfriend going to? Or is he just gonna stay back and sell more drugs to kids in the street? - Well, guess what? His kid is right here in my belly and she's gonna be beautiful. Now, listen, I gotta go. - What? - We gotta get outta here. - Hell, nah, Desa Rae. You pregnant by this fool? Hell, nah, you gotta be playing. - You can go in, the door unlocked. (Desa Rae knocks) - Mm, Roc, somebody here to see you. (door slams) - [Roc] I'm a be all right. - Hey. - Hey, what's going on. - I need to talk to you. It's really important. This letter came today. I want you to open it. I want you to open it and I want you to read it. - What is this? - I sent your information to an art collector and they are interested in your work, Roc. You do not have to live like this. - Damn. This is crazy. Hey, I really regret breaking up. - I know, baby, don't say anything, it's me. I should have said it at the shop. I do love you and I don't want you to do this, Roc. Please, I'm begging you. Don't do any of this. - Hey, man, I need you to go out and get that paperwork you asked about. Man, you high? - Yeah, yeah. - Is this bitch giving you a problem? - Bitch? I should slap the- (Desa Rae screams) - She's carrying my fuckin' baby, bro. - The only reason your ass ain't dead is because you pregnant with his baby. - Hey, get up outta here, man. Unc can fuckin' hurt you, dawg. - You better get control of your bitches, dawg, I done told you. Family over everything, nigga. (Desa Rae cries) - I'm not coming back here anymore. I'm not coming to see you in jail. And you not gonna see your daughter. You either choose between your Uncle Ronnie and us, Roc. You can't have both. I'm sick of it. Who you with, Roc, him or us? - Man, I'm always with you, what you talking about? - No, you need to choose. (dramatic music) - So Your Honor, for the past three days, we've listened to Ms. Evans make a bunch of false accusations without any merits. My client, Ronald J. Dawson, is not the man that Ms. Evans wants everyone to believe he is. Ronald hasn't caused nothing. Rocky Dawson's on the stand, now question him. - Mr. Dawson, approach the stand, please. Raise your right hand. State your name for the record. - Rocky Dawson. - Mr. Dawson, do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I do. - [Judge] Have a seat young man. Counsel, you may proceed. - Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Dawson, I'd like you to take a few minutes and tell us about Ronnie. - My uncle was like a father for me. You know, like the father I never had. He definitely cared for me more than anyone else did. He was always looking out for everybody, especially all the kids in the neighborhood. - Mr. Dawson, please tell the truth. Let's get this evil man put in jail. - Yes. - Ms. Evans, another outburst like that and I will hold you in contempt of court. Counsel, you may proceed. - Thank you, Your Honor. So, as I continue, Mr. Dawson, I wanted you to tell us about the type of you and your uncle's relationship over the years. Something's happened and you became very upset, is that correct? - Yeah, that's correct. I just saw a lot of opportunity to make some money, you know what I mean, to have some doors opened that probably wouldn't have been opened. He didn't like the direction I was going in, but I don't know, I guess I just got greedy and just stared doing shit. - Watch it, watch it. - Things that many would probably disapprove of. - So what you're saying is the charges that Ms. Evans are trying to pin against my client for the past three days should be directed towards you? Remember, you're under oath. To be clear, Mr. Rocky Dawson, it should be you in jail for first degree drug trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon. Last but not least, tampering and murder? - Not murder, but everything else, yeah, I'm 100% responsible for. My uncle had nothing to do with it. - Ladies and gentlemen, I think the burden is clear of who's guilty and who's not. Justice will finally now be served. Your Honor, arrest this man. - Bailiff, take him away. - Damn. (somber music) - Go ahead little, man. We got you, bro.

I mean, you could have never predicted all of this would happen, but it's been such a blessing. - I love it, I'm happy. - Me, too, man, you got me having baby fever like I want one. - You? You want a baby? - Girl, if I could put the wine down. - That's not gonna happen. If you do, just stay away from those that resemble Roc. They are big trouble. I still can't believe we rolled up on Uncle Ronnie like that. - Oh, my God, girl, we are Thelma and Louise, too lit. - You are my ride or die for sure. - Every day, all day, mm-hmm. - He could have killed us. He's a little crazy. - Have you spoken to Roc? - No, it's been a while. It's been about a month. The letters stopped, too. - Are you worried? - Yeah. Yeah, I try not to think about it, so. (baby screams) Latrel, put her down. - I got it. You think you could phone Mandy. I think she's calling. - You want me to get your phone? - [Latrel] Yes, please. - For Mandy. - Ooh, as in get out Mandy. - Yes, girl. Girl, he's just like his father. As an athlete, it opens many doors. - Yeah, and a lot of legs, too. - I'll be right back. I'm the mama. I send you to get stuff. This girl done called you six times, Latrel.
