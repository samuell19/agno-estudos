Hello? North Pole? Tell him that Borja called. December 24th, 1986, - Hey. - Is it good? Weird. But yes, it's good. I hope Santa will bring me what I asked for. I doubt it, though. Because he's an asshole. Why? Why what? Why do I doubt, or why is he an asshole? I don't know, Vicente. Why do you think? Is it wrong to doubt? To question the status qua? Mom doesn't know the books I like She only reads trash She lacks refinement. Wanna play? You're going to lose. I never lose, dude. The only loser around here is you. There's no such thing as The Revenge of the Nerds. Don't believe in those slogans. What happens if I lose? You'll take me tomorrow to see Short Circuit. No, impossible. Tomorrow, the 25th, is the premiere of Alien 2. 'Aliens'. It's plural. Aliens, just like you. No, like you. You're the only alien around here, nerd. Match-point. Match-point. Yes! I won! Yes! That's right! That's right! Yes! That's right! Mom, tomorrow we'll go to the movies - to the Central Theater. Vicente invited us! I used the basic food basket they gave me. I'm gonna use what those bloodsuckers gave me. Canned peaches. Why would someone want canned peaches in summer? It's a box, Mom. The groceries they gave you didn't come in a basket. They came in a box. Made out of cardboard. Besides, it's a bonus present. A gift. Never look a gift horse in the mouth. Are you kidding me? Mom, come on! It's Christmas Eve! You should be happy. Happy that another year went by and nothing has changed? Mom... Have you ever been happy? I'm sorry, but it intrigues me. Benja's mom told me the other day that she thought you were bitter. Bitter? That socialist bitch is wrong. Should I be? Are you? You're not happy, Borja. Sorry I'm so straight-forward. And you'll never be. Boys like you aren't happy. Yes, maybe I am too upfront, and I guess that can cause pain Would you rather I lie to you? The only one of us who is normal and is going to achieve things is your brother. You must be strong. And maybe you won't do so bad. You're not stupid. Well. Why don't you help me here? Ok, enough. Borja, grow up. I've grown up, mom. Trust me. I'm not a kid anymore. - Mom... - You scared me! I thought you were Borja. He thinks I won't get him these because they're too expensive. So much horror, I don't understand. He's a kid. He's at that age where everything is scary. He loves gore. - Did you let him win? - No. I mean, yes. I don't think I'll like that movie. Robots, aliens, gremlins, - poltergays... - Poltergeist. Sit down. Pet Sematary. Do you remember Pac-Man? It's awful; he's buried behind the swimming pool. Are there pet cemeteries here? - There's one in Buin, I think. - Really? That swimming pool. I don't have money for the filter. To fix it. I can't afford it. To have a pool, that's a swamp... Your paternal grandfather built it. With these temperatures, to have a pool and not being able to use it... What does that say about me as a mother? Well, that there are other priorities. Don't be so hard on yourself. That movie! Your father loved it. He defended it. Everyone said that Chilean commercial cinema was awful. Disposable. That it was an important part of the revolutionary cinema movement of the 60's. He loved 'Verdejo gasta un millon'. And this one: 'El gran circo Chamorro'. What a refined woman. Malu Gatica. What a figure! How elegant! - Not like me. - Hey. Turn it up! To remember that the years go by The story of my life. Ok. It's getting late. Let's get ready. The time has come. Stop whistling, Borja! I fucking hate the holidays. And I hate that song. Damn it's hot. This fucking house is like an oven. It's called the Nativity, for your information. What? Since when? Are you fucking kidding me? We've called this shit Easter for all our lives. Please! Easter is when Christ is resurrected and bunnies bring eggs. Grow up. I've been telling you the same thing for years. Mom, what do you want? I don't understand. Do you mean to grow up as in being taller? Or to become emotionally mature? Is that it? Because, I'm already sexually developed. You know that better than anyone. You wash my underwear, - my pajamas... - Shut up, that's disgusting. More Cola de mono, Vicente? - I pass. - I want some. You've drunk enough. Don't you want me to grow up? Let him drink. It's Christmas, after all. There's ice cream with canned cherrys for dessert. They were on discount. That's ok, isn't it? With this heat you can't do anything. I didn't feel like preparing anything more elaborate. Paula Magazine says that custard apple mousse is in fashion nowadays. I wasn't going to do custard apple mousse, of course. I don't have a housemaid. It's been centuries since we had one. I wonder how Clarita is doing? Borja, give me some more wine to swallow up this bad year and all these shitty holidays. I hope you've got plans IR RN Mine is to take a valium and watch Channel 13. Hey, pay respect to the occasion. God was born today. And he was killed 33 years later. You're my cross. You bleed me to death. - You retard demon. - Mom! What? Why do you love him so much? Don't you notice he's weird, that he's like your father? OK, Mom. As Borja says, it's Christmas Eve. - Christmas Eve. - That's right. And what's with that? I associate some of my worst nights with this fucking Christmas Eve. Silent Night? Holy Night? What silence? What love? Everyone is happy, and I'm forced to be pleased? At least you were young and didn't notice. You are not married. I need some fresh air. To get out of this freaking house. OK... And where are you going? To a friend's place Who has a family, and rites. And cousins. And they pray. Oh, and... Is she your girlfriend? Well, at least I have friends! People! I'm not a loner. I'm not a freak. I'm chosen first at the soccer matches, Borja. And you? You're the last one, aren't you? Look how I'm suffering! Look how heartbroken I am! You do suffer, dude! You do! Do you know what would be the best gift in the world? If you two disappeared. Do you want more cola de mono? What should I read first? This one. Other works of the author in our publishing house: Christine... Got it. Today. Pet Sematary... ...got it. Just today. Thanks to my mother. The Dead Zone... Got it. Salem's Lot... Got it. Fire-starter... Got it. Thinner? Thinner? Next year, maybe. Now I'm like Rudolph the Reindeer. Rudolph, the fucking Reindeer. Come here, wicked boy. Do you want some cola de mono? I'm joking. I'd never give you cola de mono. What? What? No, Gizmo! I won't give you water! Don't ask me that! No means no! You know what might happen. There, there, Gizmo. Have a rest. How many times must I say it? Don't mix alcohol and pills. Mommy dearest, when are you going to grow up? TO MY SON BORJA, A CINEPHILE FROM THE START I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH YOUR DAD. Fucking Vicente! What are you hiding, my brother? Merry Christmas, Borja. This may come in handy when you grow up. A big hug, Santa Claus. Today it'll come in handy. You like to watch? Hi, Happy Holidays. Merry Christmas. The Revelation The sensible and moving tale of the initiation of a divorced man into the world of... gay men? Hi, handsome. What are you looking at? What are you looking for? Are you looking for me? God, I love you, bro. Oh, God... this feels good... What the fuck is happening? Oh, God... this feels good... You smell like an angel! Really, fag? You think I smell like an angel? You cocksucker! Fucking fairy! Goddamned faggot! You'll hand me all of your stuff. Do you hear me? So you already came, didn't you? You love guys like me, don't you? Don't you like men? Come on, then... Become a man! Never again. Never again. I promise. I swear. I'll never go back to those filthy places. I swear. I promise. What do you want me to do? To pray? I'll pray. Our father, Who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy name; Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Never again. Never again. Take care of me. - What are you doing? - What are you doing here! - Get out! - Your magazines! Your magazines got me really horny! Where did you get them! Dude! You're queer! You're gay! We're gay! - Why didn't you tell me! - Shut up, idiot! - What's your problem! - What's your problem! Not tonight, Borja! Please, I'm done tonight. Shut up, Borja. Shut up. You talk too much. Don't say another word. Get out of my room, and don't tell anyone. This remains here. Between the two of us. Tomorrow we'll discuss it. Get out. Hey, dude... I'm calmed down. I've calmed down. But talk to me. I'm your brother. Tell me. Have you been into the bars? Have you gone to that disco, Fausto? Have you got head? - Does it hurt? - I told you to shut up, Borja. I'm not kidding. This is serious. What happened to you? What's that on your face? What did they do to you? Tell me. What did they do to you? Did you fuck a guy? Tell me. No one can know this, Borja! Not even you. You must forget this. Not possible, brother. I'll never forget this night. Does Mom know? Motherfucker! Let go, dude! Let me go, little punk! Get off me, motherfucker! Say something. What am I going to say? We're alike. We're brothers. And we like cock. You're drunk, You fucking bastard! Stop speaking in English! Borja, please understand! This is not a game! This is serious! It's not! What have I told you? What have I told you? How many times have I told you, Borja? Never touch my stuff. Never. I hate this house. This bedroom. I hate you. You hate yourself. Understand that. And there I was thinking you were the normal one. I'm normal. You think so? That you are normal? Have they sucked your dick? Have they fucked you? Is it good? Yes it is. Or do you want to suck mine? Do you want to suck mine? My cum tasted like cola de mono today Why do you think it's called that: 'monkey's tail"? It's for those of us who like to get it from behind. Just like you. Look at you, you're hard! Shut up, brat! Say another word and I'll kill you. I swear I'll kill you. Don't piss me off today, Borja. Not today. Tonight, for fuck's sake... don't fuck with me. What are you looking at? You like it. But I admit it. I admit it and you don't. It's ok. Enter the boy-scouts, go to parties, have friends, have someone, Borja. Don't be a loner. Don't be a freak. Do you know why Dad killed himself? Have you ever thought about that? Do you think he killed himself because he just saw too many bad movies? No. He didn't have a dime, and he didn't care if we had dinner on the table. He'd rather be a critic, and be in the theatre, than with us. He'd rather be trawling for trade in dark cinemas than with us, Borja. - What? - Yes. - Dad was also a faggot, Borja. - That's not true. - Shut up. - Yes, brother. Now you know the secret. Shut up, Vicente, shut up! If he had loved you as much as you think, he wouldn't had killed himself. - Shut up. - He'd have protected you. - Shut up, Vicente, shut up. B Don't you like stories? Didn't you want to grow up? This is a deranged story. It's the freakiest of them all. It's our story. Do you think Dad didn't notice I liked to look at him? That I sniffed his used underwear? I followed him once downtown. Look, he didn't want to admit to knowing what you're surely going to become, In to what we became. We're cursed. We're born out of a loveless arrangement. Who told you it was loveless? August 16th, 1999, Hello! Good evening. Welcome to the Prat's. I thought you'd never come. I've heard so much about you. First time? I think so. Yes. Definitely yes. Calm down. Relax. We're going to have a good time. This is best hour. Your name? What? Your name, handsome! What's your name? Camilo. Your ID? I need your ID, please. You'll get it back at the exit. Trust me. Everything will remain between us. In our brotherhood. Borja. Nice name. You took your time. Borja. Borja! Easy, easy. It's over. Come on... It was just a nightmare. Come here. It's OK. It was just a nightmare. I'm here. Everything is fine. You're so cute. I'm here to say goodbye. To both of you. I'm leaving to study cinema, finally. I'm going to San Francisco. We're going, with Guido, to San Francisco. That's it. I needed to tell you. To give you closure. To make things clear. To see you. I'm leaving tomorrow. We're leaving tomorrow. Some day I'll do a film about that night. But not here. They don't believe in thrillers here. I'll see you someday in hell. Yes. See you there.
