Torches were kindled on this night. The flames sparked by these torches spread until the world was on fire. There were to be 50 million victims. Adolf Hitler had become Chancellor of the Third German Reich. Hitler spoke of peace... But the same day he had appointed himself supreme commander of the German army. He ordered general compulsory military service. The German people were jubilant. They didn't even begin to grasp the real scope of this movement. GERMAN TROOPS ENTER RHINELAND This was a surprise maneuver of capital importance. It strengthened Hitler's position immeasurably. AUSTRIA IS GERMAN! REJOICING IN VIENNA! This was Hitler's first step beyond Germany's boundaries. Austria, first victim of his limitless thirst for domination. GERMAN TROOPS OCCUPY PRAGUE! Another free country was then annexed by Hitler. This time he violated the clauses of the Munich Pact. The whole world branded him as a ruthless political adventurer. AT 5:10 A.M. THIS MORNING OUR TROOPS CROSSED THE GERMAN-POLISH BORDER! Warnings about the rights of populations didn't exist for Hitler. In defiance of the Friendship Pact of 1934, Germany attacked Poland. England and France sent Hitler an ultimatum. But nothing could stop him. Now, however, the rest of the world was not just standing by. ENGLAND DECLARES WAR ON GERMANY! DECLARATION OF WAR FROM PARIS! Nevertheless, a few higher officers on Hitler's general staff condemned his policies. Hoping for the support of many units in the far reaching German military organization. They planned to overthrow him. To put an end to the aggressive war, and to come to an armistice agreement with England. Well I must confess, Your Excellency, that we should like very much to arrange a personal meeting so that you can talk with Dr. Krantz. You see his is the group's key messenger. I'm sorry Monsignor I must be on my guard in such matters. You see my government needs some concrete proof that those we shall deal with in Berlin hold responsible positions. I understand perfectly. I will ask Dr. Krantz to come and to bring the necessary proof. But the Nazi security police headquarters led by Heinrich Himmler somehow got wind of this plan. An official document was drawn up. It went by the codename of secret operation... Black Chapel. English dialog: Peter Riethof. Based on a novel in the Frankurter Illustrierte. THE BLACK CHAPEL The general idea of the story is based upon historical facts published in the FRANKFURTER ILLUSTRIERTE. The persons in the story, its characters and events are fictional and any resemblance to persons who were connected with the BLACK CHAPEL is purely coincidental. Well, what do you say to that? It's the beginning of the end. The beginning? There's been no beginning, it never ended, we can't expect it to stop. If we can speak of a beginning we're obliged to say it began with a crime and... Continues with crimes. I've served my country all my life... But now that we're on the point of attacking Britain and France I'm wondering whether I must go on ordering German soldiers to keep on aiding and abetting this. Excuse me, General Beck. The SS Colonel. I'm very much afraid the Fuehrer's keeping officers of your age in reserve for other things, General Beck. I wasn't aware of the significance of the order. The Fuehrer saves responsible men for the historical hour. But now officers of my age shall command shock troops. Yes, I'm glad for you. We've waited too long already. We must act at once. Does anyone ever come here to visit him? No, nobody. What does Mr. Golder live on? I've no idea. Two years ago he wrote quite a lot for the newspapers but now - Where is he now?! I suppose you have no idea on that either. Why should I? He doesn't tell me everything. His favorite cafe maybe. Tell me, why are you still here in Germany? I can't understand it. You're blacklisted, you can't get anything published. All the writers can't leave. Well if you find you need a job, don't forget the paper I run has room for a good writer like you. Keep it in mind. Thank you. You know Mr. Golder? Yes. - Has he been here today? - No. Well that is, he just dropped by and left right away. He wanted to go to the library, he's writing a book. If you hurry, you're sure to see him before he leaves. Gentlemen. - The Gestapo was here. - Gestapo?! They were looking for you. I don't know what they wanted, but if I were you... I'd get lost. I sent them to the library. I told them that maybe you were there. Thank you. Mr. Golder. Will you follow us, please. Where are you taking me? [Radio] "...two days after that 41,000, ?then 62,000, ?then 78,000. ?"Now it's 90,000, "107,000, "137,000, and today, 214,000!" There they are. Well. Judging by what we know about our visitor we've no reason to be mistrustful. It might still be a bit safer if 1 were alone to interview him. - Won't you sit down? - Thanks. I'm sorry that in inviting you here we were compelled to employ somewhat rude methods. You see we wanted to make sure the Gestapo wouldn't get you first. Did you think I'd swallow that bait? What do you want with me, General Beck? I want your support. I'm on the blacklist, General. You have no choice! There is always a choice. No more! The time is now past. We are living what may be the last moments prior to a world war. Is there hope? Now that he's got him, he won't let him go. All the ground work been taken care of? Yes. By now our border agents are already alerted. I don't believe that we can remain indifferent to this. It's not possible. I'm not a Bible scholar. The Bible does however have a passage that impressed me no end. "Thou sayest thy have not strength but he that knoweth all things, he understandeth." "Nothing deceiveth the keeper of thy soul." ?And he shall render to a man...". "According to his works." I'm not a soldier. You're not going into combat. Well, what can I do to help? This is urgent. You must take the express for Rome tonight. There a friend will be waiting for you at the Cafe Greco. You will see on his table three papers. You will approach and say.. "According to his works." He will answer you. Proverbs 24:12. You will turn this over to him. "According to his works." This is a priceless locket. It's worth more than our very lives. I've obtained a passport for you under the name of Rudolf Goebner. All is ready, the time is ripe. I wish you a very good trip. We'll try our best to find someone take you up to Sweden after the mission. Say hello to our friends in Rome. I hope that all goes well. Hurry. Nothing. Come on. Well there's no point in waiting any longer. I'm very sorry, Your Excellency, but Dr. Krantz insisted on the utmost urgency of the meeting. Something must have gone wrong. Possibly turned out he had no really important matters to report to us after all. If that had happened, I'm positive he'd have let me know. Dr. Krantz is a man on whom one can always count. Aren't you forgetting Vender, Monsignor? Two of his Majesty's officers were kidnapped by an extremely courteous general at Maastricht. Unmistakably on Dutch territory with the help of a detachment of SS. Since that time we've become just a little bit wary of everyone. Even people who come highly recommended, Monsignor. The doctor is a man whom we trust completely in every respect. With us, caution is a tradition. Will you show his Excellency the way. You believe there is still a possibility? And what if his colleagues in Berlin have reappraised the matter? England and France are... different from Poland. - Bravo. - Wonderful. And there are some who say that I cannot see clearly. Gentlemen. Now we drink to the health of our dearly beloved Fuehrer. Is Helmut here? He's next door, Commander Himmler. Everything's ready. Come on, Eichenberg. Coming, Commander. - Here are the latest news dispatches, sir. - Good. Well? Things are not so good in Rome. Naturally the Black Chapel. I'M no longer astonished no matter how bad the news is from Italy. Let me congratulate you on your agents, Eichenberg. What a marvelous flair you have. What we want from you is real news. That's what we expect. What do we get?! Obituaries. It was an unfortunate accident. A dead man's no use to us. Sometimes I wonder just who you're working for. For us, or... For the others. They were trying to find some kind of indication. Evidence. I've given precise and strict orders to everybody. The affair's been entrusted to Tilla Turner, our finest woman agent. I don't want to hear about your bedroom stories. The Fuehrer needs proofs. We just can't act on mere presumptions. If we are to purge the army of those who are soft. Don't you see, Eichenberg? It's proofs we need. Proofs, you hear?! Have all passengers checked on international trains. Especially all passengers from Berlin. Order all controls strictly enforced at border stations. Come on, it's time. That one's already kind of late, you know? Well, we can't help that. Loudspeaker: Your attention please. Stand back of the platform for arrival of the regularly scheduled express 77713 from Berlin to Munich... Innsbruck.... Verona..... Florence... and Rome. Attention all passengers. Will all passengers remain in their seats for passport and customs inspections. Attention all army personnel. Have your service record and papers ready for presentation. Those with steel postal numbers CL1216 will report to the station officer at once. I repeat. Those with steel postal numbers CL1216 will report to the station officer at once. I understand. Thank you. Very good. Would you look at these cards and read the future for me, Eichenberg? One two three, four, five. A dead man is sitting in a train for Rome. His regulation passport has the army stamp. Rudolf Goebner. Master Sergeant fallen in the battle of Warsaw three months ago. Passport inspection, your papers please. Thank you, I'll do it. Open all your bags. And search the compartment. Your passport. Hello? Hello?! Order station Greece. Will you please give me Commissioner Baumer. Commissioner Baumer. He's just been dispatching the night express for Rome. He'll be here in a couple of minutes. The train's gone. It's not the first time the army has beaten you to the draw, Eichenberg. So this Golder too has contrived to slip away. You must alert your agents at once. So they catch him as soon as he reaches Rome. Don't be depressed, man. The Fuehrer says our new state is to last a 1000 years. That might give you time to teach your men to do better work. Thank you very much. Excuse me, I'm late. - Waiter? - Right away, sir. Giornale d'Italia. Heavy losses... Giornale d'Italia. Giornale d'Italia. Full text of the Duce's address. Giornale d'Italia. The latest news. - All the latest news. - Oh! There, thanks. Giornale d'Italia. All the latest news. - We can go if you want to. - Alright, you've paid, haven't you? Well then, come on. Proverbs, 24:12. According to his works. - Tell me, did you know him? - No. Dr. Krantz... is the man who should have met you here. What you brought us from Berlin was meant for him. An accident? Yes, if you want to call it that. Keep one thing in mind, here in Italy all drivers are mad, no one is safe. Even on the sidewalks. You must be careful. Very, very careful. Oh, I haven't introduced myself. Count Rossi. Robert Golder. Whom should I see instead? I must ask Berlin to send me new instructions. Why don't you come and see me at 2 at Palazzo Ventura? Will you have something to drink? Yes, if you think I can get some real coffee. Alfredo, two coffees, for real friends. Yes, we're to be envied, we have a real Duce. We have real Black Shirts. And we shall soon be having a real war. But there's one thing which we haven't had for 6 long months, real coffee. Except for real friends. How about that? The light blue skies above. You Romans are people who lead the good life. ! should be wary of Rome if I were you. I'd watch my step. The city has a 1000 ears. It's an exceptionally beautiful gem. You'll be very happy with it. Goodbye, Baroness. Give me that. I always thought little gifts kept the fires of friendship burning. Take off that earring now! Berlin's not pleased with our work. With yours. Mine's alright. It's not my fault. I repeatedly warned them he should be handled with care. Good thing you did. Now another agent has been sent down. I hope with him you won't be as foolish as with Krantz, dear. Eichenberg just telephoned. This case is urgent. ! should get some kind of special pay for this. You've got everything you could possibly want. A comforting thought when I was sitting on a powder keg with a fuse lit. After we take care of this business we might rest for a couple of weeks somewhere. You'll rest without me. All men sicken me. You're so conceited. I'm the one I want to help. What's his name? Goldner... Goldler... Golder. He's staying at the Hotel Gloria. He has a nice job. Have his every move watched. And your job will be a nice easy one too. Show him the city. - For Berlin? - Yes. Radio patrol 6 calling. CW sector number 3 morse. Source seems to be between Porta Pinciana, Piazza della Conestre, and Villa della Manoli. Await instructions for changed situation owing to death of Krantz. Stop. Patrol car 6 calling, source shifting to sector number 6. I haven't the faintest idea what you want with me! It's ridiculous. You think I've been in King Solomon's Jewelbox?! Outrageous, what do you take me for, a housebreaker?! Alright, there's no need to get excited, keep calm... I've already told you three times I'm on my way to pick up my sister... I should be up for promotion... Hello there... I said I work for a living... I can't afford to stand around for an hour... Luciano, it's done. - Take the bicycle in the garage, huh? - Right. Did you get everything alright? Yes! Luciano! Good afternoon, gentlemen. All clear, they're gone. - Take it back in. - Yeah. Hello. Oh, you're finally here! So many pretty girls have been waiting for you but I'm sure once again you couldn't separate yourself from your bicycle. Don't speak ill of the bicycle. Since Botticelli we have produced nothing but famous cyclists. - Don't be too harsh on bicyclists. - We have the Duce... Unfortunately, he is not a great cyclist. - Princess, my respects. - That's right, I'm afraid he isn't. Have you met Mr. Golder, Count Rossi? - Oh, hello. - How are you? Oh, so you know Mr. Golder. He's a famous journalist. His articles are simply fascinating. Ida, you have never read a newspaper in your life. All the papers talk about is war. I don't believe what they print. Then there is no war. Well, Princess Pisani told me the King is opposed to it. Let's hope so, madam. I believe that war is sometimes desirable. It helps to make men strong. The survivors. Well one way to have survivors is the French way. They declare war but don't wage war. What do you think of my new cocktail gown? - Hmmm, I'm positively enchanted. - You really like it? Wait. Now, you see? It's perfect like that. Don't forget an amateur photographer like me has a good eye. I've got some rather nice shots. Would you like to look at a few? Yes. Excuse us. Elder gave me this writing desk. It's a beauty. And this typewriter is a little masterpiece. For instance you strike the A key and it types an N. That way you type in apparently meaningless series of letters. But your text has a meaning. Cigarette? Thanks. This goes beyond my instructions, Count. If I only knew what was in this. Golder. A soldier obeys, he doesn't argue. Just a second! Why did you have to lock the door, Emanuele? Where's the Caviar? What? The Caviar! I've looked everywhere and I can't find the Caviar. Actually I forgot the Caviar. Now please Dodo, I've asked you, don't touch anything. Don't forget you promised me that you'll call the Embassy. Don't worry, I'll call it right away. Tomorrow we'll all go out to Ostia. Now that's a good idea. You can't go with your dear bicycle at all... - There's nothing like the sea air. - Yes dear, it's very healthy. Excuse me. Secrets of state. You know what that means? The plan of the West Defensive! Think of that, Golder. You came to Rome as a middleman, a plain messenger. And you have a chance to save world peace. And as slim as this chance may be, take it. You must get word to the English about it right now. You're forgetting that I'm a German citizen. That's just it. I'm aware... that no evil perpetrated in order to prevent a war is as evil as the crime of war. But... I'm thinking of those who are up there and can't do a thing about it. Many of them may be our friends. If I knew that these documents might one day backfire on them in some way.. The Generals have thought of that before us. I'm used to doing my own thinking. Don't get me wrong, Rossi. But... unless I have some precise guarantee I can't let anyone take them. For such things the only go-between would be the Vatican. That's why I think that you're a better negotiator than I am in this case. It seems you're overestimating me a little. Here no one takes me seriously. That's precisely the way I want it. The Vatican... no. Whom was Dr. Krantz acquainted with in the Vatican, do you know? He spoke of a certain father whose name is Father Orlando. We've got to hurry. It's the 6th of May already. We have no time to lose. Where you going, sir?? Where's the Cappella Santa Maria? Straight ahead and to the right. Thank you. Go on in. Madam, you are not permitted to come into church with your arms uncovered, I'm sorry. I've heard so much about this church. Oh, would you lend me your raincoat a few minutes? Why yes. You're welcome to it. You're very kind. All I have is this. Have you change? Here, allow me. Your raincoat. Do you want it back now? I'll: come back in a second. Give it to me then. Where can I find Father Orlando? Right inside. Thank you. Father Orlando? Yes, that's right. I'm the one the late Dr. Krantz was expecting. I come from Berlin. What can I do for you? Berlin. Dr. Krantz. I came because of negotiations. Negotiations for peace. The Roman Church prays daily for peace. For peace we need much more today than just prayer. Psst, choir boy. Have you seen a young, white haired man? Yes. What's the name of the priest the man is talking to now? Father Orlando. Father Orlando. Thank you. Might I ask you your name, sir? Robert Golder. And what's your address in Rome, Mr. Golder? Hotel Gloria. Goodbye and thank you. You look nervous. Do you want your coat back? ! almost forgot it. Did you like that Chapel? I simply love churches. Well you picked the right city, that's for sure. Biggest choice in the world. Know why I came? To study art. Ah. Listen, I'm terribly sorry but now I'm afraid I must go. - Oh, goodbye. - Nice meeting you. Palazzo Ventura. We must be cautious now. Much more cautious, Father. But caution shouldn't mean fear, should it, Monsignor? In spite our desire for peace let us always remember that we cannot further expose the Church and thus provoke new persecutions for the German clergy. But would that mean that! should refuse to see the man from Berlin? Perhaps he has the documents Dr. Krantz was awaiting. No, you must not refuse to see him. On the contrary, get in touch with him. And try to find out whether he is a... bona fide envoy. Later we shall consider matters and decide. And don't forget that the enemies of peace are capable of anything. They stop at nothing. Even murder. - You're late, as usual. - Hmm. Well, what's new? Hmm, same old merry go round as Dr. Krantz. The Vatican, Saint Peters... And there he spoke to a Father Orlando. I'm tired. I also discovered he's staying at the Hotel Gloria. Room 634. Here's a wax impression of the key to his room. Smooth job, Tilla. You're making progress. I'm supposed to. Is it really as dull as that? What? I know it all. Many, many people who work abroad are tempted to do things which are forbidden at home. I'm not a girl who plays around. ! do my work, period. You'll get good pay from them. No pay's good enough for such a job. Look at what it does to me. Rome makes me sick. I can't stand it, but who cares in Berlin? What's your new client like? A very nice man, I think. ! like him. You do? I suppose it's mutual? It certainly is. Be careful. An agent who falls in love with her customer is finished. What's this? What? Love stories? No, art history. I told him that I was an art student. What kind of art? The boudoir kind? - Boudoir or not, it's beyond you. - Alright. When do you see him again? I have no idea, we didn't talk much. He left in a hurry so... He was going to Palazzo Ventura. Palazzo Ventura... I know a few steady visitors there. ! can arrange to get you in the place. Don't you worry. Carmen will arrange everything for you. Keep me informed on developments. I'll be in the shop all day. Goodbye. I was told this morning I'd see Father Orlando tomorrow. Who told you? The doorman at the Hotel Gloria. Ah, Felipo. One of our friends. So you can enjoy the sunshine in the meantime. Yes, you can see me only tomorrow. I haven't come to Rome to loll around the beach here at Ostia. Well the Church thinks in terms of centuries, you mustn't forget. ! can't forget it. The Church is eternal and all that. But today men have to make peace, and every minute counts. Emanuele. Here are a couple belated guests. Hello, I thought you hadn't gone back to Italy. - Count Rossi, Miss Turner. - Delighted. And this is Mr. Golder. Oh, my raincoat friend from St. Peter's. ! admit I'm surprised. What, you've met already, have you? I must say you haven't wasted your time in Rome. What time? I haven't got any. It seems you can be useful even without time to waste. What about a nice photo? Come on, dear, let's get our picture taken. Who is she? Hm, I don't know. She's studying art history or something. Known her a long time? Met her yesterday. Why do you ask? No special reason. Good, that was fine. Thank you very much. Thank you. Come here. Let me enjoy your company a little. I'm told you're studying art history, right? - Why yes. - But tell me, who with? Professor Lualdi? Or Antonelli? Lualdi. I was mistaken. I suppose I could have sworn he'd been pensioned off. You'll excuse me, I'm going for a swim. Well I can see how could have bored you stiff. He's the clumsiest man I know. And I know. I'm sorry, I can't stay, I've got to go back now. Everything has to be ready tonight for tomorrow's ball. You're coming too! I'd be delighted. Oh, and you must absolutely call Ferrari because they simply refuse to extend Carmen's residence permit. Are you staying a while? No, I better go on back too. And you? No. I'm staying a while longer. Good day. ASK FOR INFORMATION ON TILLA TURNER I could spend my whole life in the water. How can you sit up here bone dry? I'm afraid of the water. A good luck charm, I suppose? No. It's nothing. It would be so nice to have a small boat and sail away to some beautiful place no one goes to. If we only could. What are you thinking about? Me? How glad I am that you're here. Really? I must say you hide it very well. I wish that... it could go on and on. Alright, I'll. go and get dressed now. You get a bit more sun. Blah! Could you give me the key to 28, please. Thank you. I asked for the wrong key. My cabin is number 29. Thank you. Two espressos. Ah, 28 please. - Here you are. - Thanks. Tilla? Yes. I'll be ready in a minute. We're neighbors and we didn't even know it. Tilla... I want to thank you for this grand day. This is something that hasn't happened to me in years. What? Being just plain... well, happy. I must admit you have a funny way of showing it. Tilla... Yes? What would a man say to a woman if he likes her? Nothing at all. She knows. So..... you know? Yes. Have you got a comb? Here. The last time I was here with my sister. - Clara? - Yes. While we were in the water... - I'd like to make a phone call. - Go ahead. ...all our money and all our papers were stolen from our handbags. It must have been two young men who were lying on the beach right next to us. They looked like such nice clean young men too. It just goes to show you you can't trust anybody anymore. Hoffman? Listen to this. He has an appointment. At 9 tomorrow. Quo Vadis Church with Father Orlando. Another point that could be interesting - he wears a gold locket. ! what? Stay with him until then? You mean until tomorrow after 97. Oh, you're getting quite demanding. Well alright. After all, why not? I'll be phoning off and on. Goodbye. TILLA TURNER... UNKNOWN IN WAR DEPARTMENT Well, it seems we must make inquiries with our friends in the SD. Excuse me, sir. Group Commander Eichenberg has just come in and he wishes to speak to you. Heil Hitler, Hoster. Your welcome, Group Commander. Please sit down. But to what can I attribute this exceptional honor? We must try to collaborate more closely. Our Western Offensive is imminent. We must absolutely keep it a secret. I agree with you. But! doubt that it's imminent, Commander. If I have been informed correctly, the General Staff wants it postponed. The sooner we strike the greater the enemy's confusion, Colonel. Yes and how will world opinion react to it? Who cares? When we've won, the ideas of the idiots who failed to see... the goals of our great Fuehrer will be unimportant. This major plan in my opinion should be accelerated to prevent betrayal from spoiling the effect of a surprise attack. It happens we have some clues. Come now, let us not beat around the bush. Thank you, Hoster. Events have never looked so perilous as they now seem. Under the circumstances, I believe my effort to submit a petition... to the Fuehrer to ask him to postpone the offensive is a poor idea. ! find chances of a favorable response very slim. Now our big job is to revive our apparently stagnating Roman church mission. Especially since the Gestapo already has too much information on it. Hoster and Kanaris. Those are the sly foxes. What are you talking about, Eichenberg? That doesn't incriminate them. However... This latest move by the General's clique to try to change the Fuehrer's mind definitely confirms all our suspicions. But we haven't any proof. We must therefore advocate the earliest date for the attack. Here. Thanks. Wait here, please. Here you are. Tilla? Where are you? Drawing the curtains. Stay near me, Tilla. There's no answer. Better go on up to his hotel. We can't wait any longer. And watch out. What makes you so nervous? I've got to go. You haven't even finished your coffee. Come. Come and sit by me. Why do you have to look so sad, Robert, darling? You don't understand. Tilla... I'm sure I love you. Why must we live in a day when there's no place for love in the world. Robert... I also love you. Can't we just dream? Tilla, your voice sounds different. It's because I've said it for the first time. It could be the last, that's why. Wasn't there anything else for me? No, that was all. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Yes, I deliver it. Any mail? I've already put it out on the desk. Is something the matter with the phone? No, why? Here we are. Will you please gather around. Alright, here we go. Overhead on the ceiling you see Peter on his flight from Rome to escape crucifixion. One of the world's finest frescos. Please go straight ahead now. You will now see a far more interesting work of art. Peter in the compana of Rome. Right up there. And now we shall see one of the finest of all frescoes. Right up there you see Peter when he meets Our Lord and asks him in Latin the question, ?"Quo vadis Domine?" "Whither goest thou, Lord?" Now will you follow me please to the most interesting fresco of all. Ladies and gentlemen, above you now see Our Lord Jesus Christ answering Peter, "go to Rome that I may be crucified again.? Look at the countenance of Jesus Our Lord. Marvelous. Can't you just hear Our Lord saying, "I go to Rome that I may be crucified again." Will you please step this way now. Only a Vatican Prelate offers such moral guarantees. I'm therefore ready... To remit these most vital documents to one having authority to accept them. So that the British Ambassador may receive the documents. With the greatest moral guarantees he can have. Please understand me, Father Orlando. You see, anyone who would... turn the documents directly over to the enemy would be a traitor. I understand. If you will be at 6 o'clock tonight at the Fountain of the Turtles I will see that you meet the responsible parties. But it's urgent. 6 is terribly late! I cannot do better. But Father Orlando, please. I ask you not to forget that the existence of the Church maybe at stake. Our Roman church counts with the Almighty for we trust him entirely. Unfortunately I'm obliged to go. I'll see you at 6. Ah, my dear Hoffmann. We've got some differences. Somehow we must try to solve them. In the first place, a point of geography. Germany borders a certain pass. Ah, no? The Brenner. Yes, my dear Hoffmann. I mean at least... that's what it was the last I heard. And you know there's another thing that has stuck in my mind. Your Fuehrer's reassuring promise, no Gestapo in Italy. Mr. Prefect, may I remind you, I am a tradesman. Yes. You are one of Rome's best jewelers. So I know where to go. You must confess that I have shown quite a bit of patience with you. And I trust you're intelligent enough not to force me to use my ace in the hole. I may assure you, Prefect. That I am not responsible for Krantz' death. Oh yes, I had nearly forgotten. I also meant to inquire about the health of your picturesque Swiss employees. There's Herrman... who was born in, I think it Strutgart. And the other man, oh what is his name? Come here, Hoffmann, help me, won't you? You know, the one from Hamburg. That proves nothing. It doesn't prove a thing, you're absolutely right. But our goal is to help each other, and if we do.... I'm sure that everything will be cleared up. You wish to help? Hm? So shall we begin? Suppose we start with the Hotel Gloria. Ah, my dear Prefect ... Are you also interested in such things? If you recall I'm Prefect of Police. Yes, I know, I know. And Felipo? An accident. A shame, he was so nice. But my men are in no way responsible. He should have watched his step. Yes, hmm. That is most reassuring. You were right. The matter is cleared up. You will find that honest men always have the same weaknesses. After all, we are pulling at the same rope. You pull just a little bit too hard. I'm... I'm angry. I'm angry and I say it quite honestly too. I'd deem myself very lucky if I could only... Another thing before I forget it. If! am not mistaken, this belongs to you. Oh.. There are plenty of jewelers magnifiers in Rome. We happen to find this one right near the body of Dr. Krantz. Please return it. To your gold dust twins. By common standards I should have you arrested, Hoffmann. But I wish to avoid complications. So I'm giving you and your playmates one week to leave the country. The commander of the SS is already notified to that effect. That's a violation of our rights. An insult to the face of the Fuehrer. My dear Hoffmann. One thing I always liked in you is your sense of humor. Will you escort him and see that my orders are carried out. Yes, sir. I'd like to know who this Ferrari thinks he is, Eichenberg. We simply must employ emergency measures. Yes, you'll need them. Your bungling flunkies have really fouled things up. - But we've made every effort to... - Quiet. What will the Fuehrer say?! Your crew will pay for this mess. Wire at once to Rome, and tell them.... That I personally order their return. And if they don't bring something back - they're through! - Yes sir, immediately. But I have good news as well. A team of radio patrol... I don't care! Leave me alone. Yes? Yes, Mein Fuehrer. I am always ready. You may count on me. Heil, Mein Fuehrer. The die is cast, Eichenberg. Against France. Very good at last. And besides, within a few hours, we'd have more than ample proof against the Army General Staff. We found the approximate location of the secret radio station. It will very soon be out of action. I hope this time you will keep your promise... Eichenberg. Thank you so much for coming here, General. I've heard that Admiral has seen Hitler, is that so? Kanaris gathered the impression that the offensive cannot be delayed for much longer. - And from Rome, has any news come in yet? - No. And what about that girl, Tilla Turner? Our men under Himmler are taking their time, but I expect to get their information any minute. When I do, I'll pass it on at once. I'm wondering why that Robert Golder hasn't yet moved. Hello. Oh. Why? But tell me what happened. Why won't you tell me right now? I'll be there. Goodbye. You're sure no one outside will hear? No, even if he falls like a stockpile. Ah, you don't have to be crude about it. Play a little with him, till he spills it. Suppose he don't spill it at all? He will. Then we wrap him up and send him home. See. We've got a live fish in our net. We'll wait another citation. Already? You were in a great hurry to get here. What do you mean? You said it was urgent so I rushed. Give me your watch. Are you crazy? Right now. You're going to come for it this afternoon. With your friend, Robert Golder. Understand? What time? At 4. And what then? What then? Then we'll squeeze what he knows out of him. Or have uh... the hours spent in bed with you already fallen? If I knew something I'd have told you already. Please excuse me, Countess. My, you've become prudish lately. But Prully won't help anymore. Ferrari's kicked us out. What do you suppose will happen to me in Berlin now! I simply got to take something back! So before going, we've got one more thing to do. Make him tell us what he knows. And see that he goes too. 4 o'clock, is that clear? You've come just at the right time, I need you. Sir, there's a young lady here to see you. A Miss Tilla Turner. I haven't got time. She's recommended by Countess Ventura. Good looking? Hmmm. Alright, you'll come a little bit later. It's not that important. Show the young lady in. Come right in. ! don't know how to thank you. You're such a busy man. Oh, you're welcome. Won't you please sit down? How may I be of help to you, my dear? For friends of my friends I do wonders. Well I'm wondering if you happen to recall a certain Dr. Krantz. Yes, of course, the poor man. An unfortunate accident. It couldn't have been an accident. Pardon my effrontery. Although I admit that here in Rome there are more and more accidents. You see, one of my good friends thinks he may have one soon. Say, that is interesting. In fact, most interesting. I suppose you, uh, knew Dr. Krantz personally, didn't you? Well yes, we met. And once or twice I went out with him. A pleasure. He is to be envied. And what's the name of this friend of Dr. Krantz? Robert Golder. He lives at the Hotel Gloria. You know I can easily imagine you in the role of my personal fair collaborator. I am sure you're quite valuable. Our meetings should be rather frequent. But of course, not here. An office is no proper setting for such charm. It'll be... at my house. Hm? We certainly have a lot of things to say to each other. It's possible, I guess. After all, why not? You will... Protect this friend? Ah. protect, yes, exactly the right word, protect. The first duty of a police chief - protection. You? Robert. Robert. I simply had to see you again. What's the matter, darling? Why are you crying? I have to tell you something. Who's there? Police. Open up. Give this to Rossi at once. Swear you will? Yes, I swear. - Signor Golder? - Yes. We have orders to arrest you. Tell him, tonight at 6 I was to see... Alright, come on. Where is he? The police arrested him. What?! In front of my own eyes just when ! was about to bring him to you. These filthy Mediterraneans. They've dared to arrest a German. The poor idiots. I'll call up Himmler. Himmler will have him set free right away! That'll show them. - Hello, Colonel. - Hello, Uncle. Werner, you must leave at once. Our PC promised to call in 20 minutes. Try to raise them, they could be listening in right now, who knows. Here's the text. OU to RPZ... Tilla Turner has been working since '38 for Himmler. Tilla Turner has been working since '38 for Himmier. - I'll go now. - Is your mother back? - She'll be here tonight Uncle. - Alright. Don't forget to give her my love, Elsa. I won't. Are you in touch with Annette? Station 1-4 from 1-2. Pirate source between 180 and 186 degrees. Please acknowledge. Come in, 1-4. The bearings from Stations 1-2 and 1-4 and our own bearings locate source somewhere in sector 16. From Station 1-6 to Station 1-2. Pirate source appears to be a mobile one. Bearings are shifting. Your bearing here is 230 to 250 degrees. From 1-4 to 1-6 from here bearing on pirate is 270 to 275 degrees. Get rid of the radio. Throw it overboard! Not yet! Straight ahead. That's it. It's the harbour patrol! Signorina Turner. There you are, my dear. The place is a battlefield. We'll never get everything ready for the Ball this evening. Impossible to obtain help so I had to do everything myself as usual. But what's wrong, my dear? Robert Golder was arrested. What? Arrested? Who by? The police. That's just perfect! If my guests start to get picked up by the police, what's next? Hear that? Golder's been arrested. Oh! Count Rossi! I want to speak to you. It'll only take a second. Excuse us a minute. If you want everything fixed up I'll call up Ferrari. Well, what was it you wanted? Robert gave it to me and asked me to give it to you. Did he say anything else? He didn't have time to say anything else. All he could do was whisper that he had a meeting at 6. I don't know who with. It's beyond me. Exactly what is your little game? Game?! When they've arrested the man I love. ! must speak to the Prefect. The name is Dodo Ventura. Thank you. I'm going to get the matter all straightened out. Yes, but... You know for my friends I'd do anything. My dear Prefect, what about Robert Golder? Didn't you know..... He was my guest today. ! should be happy to be of help to you. The problem is that a Prefect cannot perhaps act the role of lawbreaker. Oh, he's being a little skiddish. The man's out of his mind. Who does he think he is? If you'll be so kind, that's it. Yes. Yes. No use hanging up, she'll call back. Why yes, my dear, you're coming in loud and clear, I hear you. - Yes. - A call coming in from the Gestapo. Oh? Hm. Ferrari speaking. My respects, General Himmler. Huh? What did we do to Golder? He must now be released? Don't forget the rights of German citizens are inalienable. And I protest against any and all such methods used by your police in Rome, Ferrari. We in Rome always treat German citizens with the respect which is due German citizenship. I think I'm making progress. Yes, what's that? Oh I'm sorry I can't hear. Speak louder! But - hello! I'm absolutely in agreement with you. Should this go on, Italians in Germany will be treated in a similar manner! Now will you transmit the order? I'll transmit your personal intervention in favor of Robert Golder. Your voice isn't clear! I'm hearing voices in the background. What was that? My respects once again, Commander. - Ts the State Minister, Excellency. - Uh. Ferrari speaking. Hm? "Liberate Golder immediately." I see the Embassy of the German Reich demands it. By all means. Why, naturally. By all means. Give my respects. Goodbye. Hm. You've convinced me thoroughly, my dear. I am indeed glad that I can render this service. I assure you that Golder will be released right away. There, what did I tell you. With men a bit of patience works marvelously. Everything's alright. Signor Hoffmann? Yes. I wanted to tell you... We're letting him go. Yes. Thank you. Signorina Turner please. She's not in? Have her call me as soon as she returns. This is Hoffmann. Herrman! Better get the cars ready, We've work to do. That fellow Golder won't give us the slip again. 2 steamship tickets for Venezuela. You will sail on the Saturnia. The boat leaves at midnight sharp 11th of May in Genoa. Thank you. Hmm. We must always bear in mind that the Fuehrer may give the order in any moment. In that case I see no other possibility. I can't do it. 1 just can't bring myself to it. Hello. Yes, speaking. Very good. Thank you. At Headquarters I might route an announcement through to the top that will warn our supporters about Tilla Turner. ! might refuse to pass my orders on down. Look, General, you must not renounce now. Maybe you could refuse to transmit your orders, but what good would that do? It would last only an hour. Before another man would stand in your stead. A man who would be a loyal follower of the Fuehrer! You're absolutely right, Horster. But I can't help being loyal to myself. A man who can't be loyal to his convictions to the very end deserves no more than contempt. I've lost, lost irretrievably! Forgive me. Please understand that I will now speak to you as a friend. You're seeking escape in flight. You would rather die than get your hands dirty. But how can you say such a thing? There are occasions when death can be the most convenient way out. But you have no right to choose it. You'd be doing the Nazis a big favor. Our country is experiencing the darkest period in its entire history. That's precisely why we require men like you. What do you want with me? Do you expect me to be thankful for my release? That might well be, yes. - I was arrested without reason. - Hmm. And I did not get any explanations. Ah, the methods of the police are much the same everywhere. Why be so severe in your attitude, My dear Signor Golder? If you knew the number of individuals who daily take undue pains just to break laws, instead of living peacefully, hmm. And please don't misunderstand me because I have great respect for you. I take it that I'm allowed to leave now? The Prefect will let you go, but Countess Ventura would truly be virtually inconsolable if you missed her party. ! had to extend a firm promise to take you to it. Such variety today. Prison this morning, the Ball tonight. Why be so cynical? That's friendship. You make it extremely difficult for anyone to like you. I shall indeed not rest easily before I know you are among common friends and therefore in good hands. Dodo. Darling! - We're not the last ones here. - No, we're not. You're in good hands, nothing to worry about. How does Anna manage to look so enchanting every time? - Well look at yourself, you're doing alright. - Thank you. His Excellency Ferrari, Police Prefect, and Signor Golder. I knew you wouldn't dare come here without your prisoner. I think it's too perfect for words. Emanuele, Signor Golder is naked. I'll tend to the matter right away. His Excellency, the Ambassador of Spain. Excellency! Here you are. Thanks. Have you got the object? Ah, yes. I was to meet the Vatican delegate, an important person at 6. And no idea who the person is. If only Father Orlando could be reached. A Father, tonight? Hm, can't be done before tomorrow. Have you found out why they arrested me? No, not yet. But I will. I give you my word. What time is Hoffmann coming to get us? Did he say anything? Not before 12. And what are you going to do? The same as you. Watch out. Surely you know, my dear, how much I esteem your husband so let him be cautious when he goes out cycling. I'm always afraid he'il have an accident which would pain me no end for as I said I have such esteem... Signorina Tilla Turner. May 1? Yes. It would be funny if I said 'No" the first time you asked me to dance. I've two steamship tickets for Venezuela. The boat leaves the 11th from Genoa. I can't leave. Why not? I must meet somebody here. VWhy wait, then? Why not meet him now and get it done? Because I don't even know the name of the man. I'll make it clearer. Come. Tilla, did you ever start to do something that didn't seem really important and then somehow all of a sudden it's the most important thing in the whole world. Listen. Each human has a certain influence on the lives of all. Everybody. You don't realize it or it doesn't seem important. A certain object was placed in my hands and this object could have a very great influence on the lives of many people. I've been an onlooker in life. But I have a real role now if you're willing and it has the world for a stage. And I'm now going to play this role... Darling I haven't had a minute to say hello to you yet. I'M so rude. You look gorgeous. You're simply out of the world. I'm afraid that I must have a talk with Mr. Golder. He will return. - He won't be long. - Excuse me. Hurry and notify Hoffmann. Midnight will be too late. He's got to be here within the next half hour. I shouldn't move from here. That's what he said. Alright, but you can't claim that you haven't been warned. I'm sorry. Come and dance with me. It may be the last time we dance. Why do you say that? We have the whole evening, the whole night. And our whole lives ahead of us. Don't you know we live in a world where there's no place for love? - Who ever told you that? - You did. We'll have one dance. We'll have this Ball. And that will be the end for us, Robert. Why? What are you saying? I'm the one who had you arrested, Robert. Only to save you. In only a quarter of an hour they'll be here to kill you. Who are you, Tilla? Robert, please don't ask. Who are you? Go to a prelate called Monsignor Sera. He lives at Palazzo Chiari. Rome isn't safe anymore for you. Go to Genoa with your boat ticket. I'll see you the day after tomorrow on board. How did you find out all this? Robert, no more questions. Please? Who gave you the Monsignor's name? I've got to know. Krantz. Dr. Krantz. With him too. It's not true, don't believe it. I really believed you loved me but it wasn't so. ! do love you. Oh, Robert, the first day we met I wanted to forget the past and start over again. But I couldn't protect you from them. Please no more questions. Your life is at stake. The blazes with my life. Robert! Signor Golder. You're not leaving already? Robert! No, no, my dear, you should never chase men. Just ignore their fits and petty tantrums and they always come back. Don't worry. Leave us, please. Signorina Turner. For the time being, do not leave the palace, I beg you. As your host I reserve the honor of accompanying you home personally. What do you want? I must see Monsignor Sera about something. - At once. - That's impossible, he's asleep. It's most urgent. Terribly urgent. He can't be disturbed. This is no time to see him, but I must! This is really important. Please believe me it's... One moment! What I must tell him is of vital importance. At this hour Monsignor Sera listens to no one. He will be interested in me. I swear he will be... What is this? Who's making all that noise? According to his works, Monsignor. I am Robert Golder. I have long expected your visit. Come, Signore. What are you thinking of? Oh, there's much to think about, that I must say. But perhaps we could pursue this chat elsewhere. If you will allow me, I can take you home. Thank you, but I have an appointment I must not miss. Then I shan't bother you any longer. Don't lose him. Watch out. Where we going to? Come on. Tilla Turner. Number 236 on Himmler's list of agents. Alias Katrina Vaya, Helga Fischer, Ruth Kline... Do you confess to having been instrumental in the deaths of Dr. Krantz and Felipo Boliche? Let's have a cigarette. The procedure was unusual. I'm no murderer, Tilla. You've imperiled a cause championed by all the finest men living in our day. It would be a real crime to forgive you for this. Men don't count for me in the plural. My heart went to one man. Watch out! His Excellency, Lord Osbourne. Ambassador of Great Britain. Excuse me, Monsignor, but I was delayed by events tonight. Your Excellency, this is Robert Golder. He is in possession of the documents requested by your government. ! hope, Your Excellency, that they bring adequate proof of the good faith of my employers in Berlin. Your friends in Berlin, my dear sir, at zero hour tonight invaded Holland and Belgium with 120 divisions. There was apparently no trace of any refusals of obedience. I must therefore harbour doubts on your wishes for peace. If you will excuse me, Monsignor. It was not. God's Will that this trial be spared us. We failed, Monsignor. For we did not do the best that we could. No, my son. Failure commands no shame in such a mission as this. You did as well as you could. You see, in life the important thing is not to succeed, but to try.
