Happy birthday, Little Deedee. Dad! Pray for the soul of the deceased, Theodore Joseph Logan. Daniella, are you alright, dear? - I thought maybe you needed something. - I'm fine, thanks. - Let's go and join the others. - Yes. Contrary to what people are led to believe, in the final analysis, Raymond, women are much stronger than we are. Take childbirth, for example. No man could endure it. And yet they have a hidden strength, they're programmed for it. - lf you will excuse me, doctor. - By the way, I read this article. Are you okay? Would you like to come and stay at our house tonight? No. Thank you. I think I'll be alright for tonight. But I'm glad I've sold the house. I can't bear to be there alone. And you, instead of worrying about everybody else, you should go and get some rest. The baby kicks a lot. But worse is boring Doctor Larabee. He's been giving me advice all afternoon. In his expert opinion, I'm "programmed to deliver". Here he comes, now. Got to go fetch Raymond. I'm exhausted. How are you feeling, Daniella? All right. But those tests you're doing on me are very tiring. Well, the thing is we've started so we should go through with it. - Are you experiencing any pain? - Only sometimes. Keep taking the pills and double the dose, if necessary. When will you get the results? - Soon. A couple of days. Daniella. Now the worst part begins, Simon. His absence. I know, sweetheart. I know. But you'll move on. You're strong, like him. Daniella, there's something we have to talk about. Your mother will have to be told what has happened. If you want me to, I'll do it. No. No, thank you. But this is something I have to do myself. I don't know how I'm going to break it to her, but I will. I'm leaving now. I've got some work to do. But today? A lot of the larvae are ready to open. Mind yourself. - Mr. Hastings? - Hastings, yes, that's me. This is it, bring the stuff in. - But, what stuff? - I'd almost forgotten. I bought them the other day, for Chrysteen and the baby. I know that you've decided that the baby will be born at home, so I took the liberty. I hope you don't mind. I wanted to be the one to buy them. Of course not. How could I mind? Thank you. - Goodbye, Simon - Goodbye. Day one. Sample RBK-72. Environment sterilisation confirmed. Temperature stabilised at 32?. 78% humidity. Daniella, Iook at the camera, love. Go on. Wave to Daddy. Hello! Look! Mummy's got the camera. Look at me love, go on. Love, don't be shy. Go on. Smile! Don't be shy, silly! Today's your birthday. You're eight, a year for every rose in this bunch. I can't be there with you. But someone will see that you get this at the right time. Inside you'll find your present. A always, always, wherever I may be, Happy birthday, little Deedee. Always, wherever I may be, happy birthday, little Deedee. - Good morning, Miss Logan. - Good morning. Thank you. - Daniella? - Hello. Good morning. How has she been this week? No change. More or less the same. I have to tell her what's happened. I'm afraid... She's so fragile. What do you think? To be quite honest, I don't think she'll understand. - lf you need me, I'll be in my office. - Thank you, Doctor. He takes our orange marmalade away! Fucking Doctor Grant! Hello, Mum. How are you today? The doctor tells me you've had a good week. There's something I have to tell you. Something terrible has happened. Dad is dead. I wanted to be the one to tell you. Fucking Doctor Grant. He's broken the little house. He breaks everything. Fucking Doctor Grant! Josephine? You spoke. - I heard you. - Josephine? It's me. Daniella, your daughter. Josephine? josephine! It's me. Who's josephine? Just step aside. She's very agitated. Just step aside. Fucking Doctor Grant! Fucking Doctor Grant! "josephine"? I'm sorry but... should it mean something to me? I thought it might be the name of a nurse, or another patient. Someone she might be friends with. Forgive me for being so blunt, but as you well know, your mother has no contact with anyone at all. Maybe this is a good sign. In all these years your mother has never reacted to any external stimulus. This could give us some cause for hope. Perhaps the shock produced by the death of your father will help her start to react. I've always had this feeling that he only lived to make me happy. I just don't understand how he could do this to me. It's as if he's abandoned me, and I need to know why. What could have possibly happened to make him do such a thing? He always seemed like such a serious man to me. It was as if he found it difficult to smile. There was a sadness about him. Because of what happened to Mum. Maybe that is why we were so close. For my last birthday he gave me a butterfly. A new undiscovered species. Scientists were still discovering new species in Africa and the Amazon. He had one ordered from an entomologist, and he sent it to me, hidden in a bunch of twenty-four red roses. We named it together:. "The Green Logan Butterfly". - You're joking. - No, seriously. He won't be here for this birthday. No more roses. - Your jaw still troubling you? - Yes. I need a vacation. Take it easy. Isn't it a bit late for a fellow like you to be out all alone? I've got all the company I want, thanks. Okay. Good night, Chrysteen. - And goodnight, Gabriel. - Or Gabriella. We'll have to wait and see. It'll be a boy, you'll see. I have a feeling it will. Here, take this. I want him to have something of mine. - No, leave the light on please. - Okay. Good night. Agent. Miss Logan, isn't it? I am lnspector Potts, in charge of this case. Nobody has seen anything, there are no traces of any kind. We are looking for them. This really is a very peculiar occurrence. Why? Can you tell me why? I don't know, Miss, I've no explanation for this. We are questioning the watchman, but it seems he fell asleep watching some television programme. - So, what are you going to do now? - Do? Regarding what? Regarding what? Regarding this of course. Somebody has dug up my father's body and has stolen it. What's more, they've made absolutely sure we'd know they've done it. You wouldn't believe the strange things we see in this job! Probably the work of a bunch of kids. Listen to heavy metal backwards and... Children? Are you serious? Sorry, I must be going. I'll keep you informed of whatever we find out. Shit! Boys, this cup isn't a clue. I've just left it here myself. That's it? - You're just leaving like that? - I'll keep you informed. Thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll take them home for the missus. Yes, oh, yes. Come on, kill him. Excuse me. I am looking for a man. That's nothing new. You'll get over it in time. He's my father. Yes, he was here. A real gentleman. - Was he staying here? - A smart man like him? Not likely! He came to visit a friend. I can't think what they've got in common, though. That bloke, that friend of his, it gives you the creeps to look at him. Still, he paid a full month in advance. He's upstairs, in room 26. He's out at the moment though. - Could it be a man called Harris? - Yes, Harris. Toby Harris. Excuse me, but if you already know, why do you ask? - Waitress. Waitress! - I am not a waitress, get it? - Whisky! - You got any money? First rule in Hell: nothing's free. I'll bring it to you straight away. About what time will you be expecting Mr. Harris back? He's usually back by evening, but I couldn't swear to it. And some crisps! A bag of crisps to line my stomach! Damned drunk. Alright, alright! I'll take him his rat poison, then maybe he'll give me some peace. Lets see, where were we? Ah, yes, Harris. Do you want to leave a message for him? No, that's all right. I'll come back some other time, thank you. Fair enough. "Hastings and Logan." I wasn't here on Thursday, but I can look it up in the entrance book. Lets see. Thursday, Thursday... What? Sorry. It was Piet's shift, the new boy. And I'm afraid he must have forgotten to write it down. All he's put down is the name of the visitor. Yes, Toby Harris. I know that already. Toby Harris? The same one who used to work here? I thought he was still in jail. - ln jail? - For murder. It was before you were born, must be more than twenty years ago. It was in all the papers. I'll remember to ask Piet - who it was he came to see. - Okay, thanks. Toby Harris, thirty-one years old, resident in our city, was arrested yesterday for homicide in the first degree. On the thirteenth of September Toby Harris hit his wife and set their house on fire. Where is the missing baby? Hello? Hello? - Daniella? - Yes, speaking. Daniella... There's a present for you. In reception. Who is this? Listen, I warn you, I'm not alone. Silently night has come. Little old lights are stars. Lazy, the moon arises. Sleep quietly, sleep, my child. Hello, reception? Silently night has come. Little old lights are stars. Lazy, the moon arises. Sleep quietly, sleep, my child. Fly through your land of dreams. Sleep quietly, sleep, my child. Dogs will keep you safe. Birds will keep you warm. You deserve all the love the world can give a child, my child. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. - What the hell is this they've told me? - The truth, Henry, nothing but the truth. This certainly is a most extraordinary case. In all my years in this profession I don't think I've ever seen anything so meticulous, so... just a moment. What's this here? There's something written on the skin. It says... - My God! - What is it? Tell me. It says, "Satan ordered me to do it". It's signed "Henry Potts". Okay, very funny. All day smelling this shit. I can understand how you ended up like this. One of these days you'll kill a nun with an axe, you and your monster here. You can prepare the body for cremation now, Jedediah. Is that all you've got to tell me? Or is there something worth hearing? Well, let's see. Logan's body was found in a rubbish dump, kneeling down. A two-meter pole had been inserted through his chest, from the 16th vertebrae, emerging just below his sternum. His legs had been nailed to the ground through the femoral muscles by two wooden stakes. His hands had been tied together with barbed wire, as if he'd been praying. - Why should anyone do that? - lt looks to me like a ritual crime. - You know, devil worshipping. - Demons and all that jazz? Now let me tell you my joke for the day. I have to go and explain all this to the man's daughter. I wouldn't worry about that too much, Henry. They've done that job for you. Satanic? Is that all you've discovered? And you call yourselves police? - Miss Logan, I beg you... - Don't beg me. Do something! Here. He's been following me for days, photographing me. I'm sure he's the one who's been calling me on the phone to scare me. He was with my father the night before his suicide. - But how did you know...? - He's a dangerous man. You can read it in those newspapers. Question him. He stole my father's corpse. Find out why. And why has he been following me? Here's his address. Miss Logan, everything is ready. I'll go and find Harris right away. Simon. I want to get to the bottom of this. I need to know why he killed himself. And why is all this happening. Will you help me? Yes, I'll help you. Promise me. I promise. We must talk. I'll be waiting for you at the Excelsior. Padre Elias Dranig. You got here quickly. Toulouse, April, 1917, the middle of World War l. And this other one took place in Rome, in 1953, very near the Vatican. They were the only three cases that were known up until today. This one, your father's, is the third. I came as soon as I heard about it. Excuse me, a case of what? They were all victims of ritual vengeance. What are you talking about? The Abrahamites. They have existed since Old Testament times. Sorry, but I find this in very bad taste. My father, who had no reason to commit suicide, shot himself. And I have not got time for sick jokes like this. "Sleep my child." That's what the inscription at the bottom of the tree means. So I see you've been to my house. Of course. How else could I have left you my message? By the way, why there is only one tree planted in your garden? It was my parents' idea. They planted it after I was born. The inscription goes back to my mother's Russian origins. And it doesn't mean "sleep my child", it means "once upon a time". Your parents lied to you. That phrase is the beginning of an Abrahamite prayer. Yes? Why would these Abrahamites want to punish my father? It's obvious. He disobeyed one of their rules. Are you suggesting that he was one of them? You must be mad. I see my little vice has alarmed you. Do you recall what the Bible says about healing the sick? A syringe like this can do a lot of harm, and also do a great deal of good. I am a poor diabetic, who has a pathetic addiction to insulin. Miss Logan, are you a believer? Look, if you've got nothing sensible you can tell me... There is something I would like you to see with your own eyes. What? The proof that what I have told you is the truth. Do you know what this is? Abraham, about to sacrifice his son. And the Angel stopping him in the nick of time. It's in the Bible. Everybody knows the story. Look at it again. Look at it carefully. What is the Angel doing? He's restraining Abraham's hand. No, you are mistaken. Take a good look at his expression. Notice the position of his hand. What he is doing is encouraging Abraham to tighten his grip around lsaac's throat. The true will of God. And the faith of the Abrahamites. The killing the first-born, the great tribute to God, who will reward the believers and fill their house with joy, after the sacrifice is complete. But the Bible says that God, at the last moment, sent the Angel and saved lsaac. Yes, but it then says that Abraham came down from the mountain alone. There is no mention of lsaac after that. The custom of sacrificing the first-born was deeply and strongly rooted amongst the ancient Hebrew people. In giving the story of lsaac a happy ending the authors of the Bible aimed to help eradicate this ancient ritual. But the Abrahamites have kept it alive. Even to this day. They are convinced that by killing their first-born they will secure God's favour. Don't forget that it was God himself who sent his son to be sacrificed. Let's get this straight. According to you, my father was a member of this group. I am his only child. His first-born. Then, why am I alive? Did your father have a second name? When they are born, the first-born of the Abrahamites are given the father's second name. Was your father's second name Daniel? Was it Daniel? No. It was joseph. In that case his first-born should have been called Joseph. - And and if it was a girl? - She would have been called Josephine. If they haven't got extravagant habits, how can they be recognised? They can't. But there are a lot of them, many more than you might think. It sounds, I don't know... It sounds like something out of the past. Every day, millions of human beings gather together to drink the blood of a man who died two thousand years ago. That also seems like something out of the past, wouldn't you say? But to strangle your own son! My God! It's a fact. Moreover, on this particular point, the law of the Abrahamites is clear and strict: only the hands of the father can kill the first-born. Quite frankly, Father, I find this all very difficult to believe. But... my mother has been in a psychiatric hospital for years. I went to visit her the other day, and she called me "Josephine". She said it over and over again. "Josephine." "Josephine." Goodnight, princess. Calm down, relax. I've had this pain for days, since my last examination. I thought it might be normal, but now, with the bleeding... Relax. Now, I'm going to do a hysteroscopy to examine the uterus. I'm afraid you might have a endometrial polyp. The scab from the wound has come away and there's some internal bleeding. It's perfectly normal. I'm going to try to stop the bleeding. It may hurt. Doctor. I know this sounds silly. But, did my parents ever have another daughter? Another daughter? - Where did you get that idea? - I know it seems absurd, but... Your parents and I have been friends for as long as I can remember. If they'd had another daughter, I would've been the first to know, don't you think? Yes, the thought had occurred to me. Well, I'm done. There's nothing abnormal. I think it could all be a result of the stress you've been under the last few days. Keep taking the tablets I prescribed. And if you have any more symptoms... What about you? You've never had children? No. My wife and I never had children. The truth is, there was no time. She left me before... Let's get you dressed and we'll make an appointment for you next week. - Hello! - Daniella, this is Simon. I have had a visit from... Hi, Simon. Do you know anyone that can translate Russian? No, I don't think so. Listen, Daniella. This is serious. I'm in your father's office and lnspector Potts is here. He has been looking for you all day. He has some news for you. About Toby Harris. Isn't he the man who was in jail? Yes, that's the man. He worked for you years ago. - And he's mixed up in all this. - Yes, he wants to talk about that. I think you'd better come right away. jesus. It's no wonder that the girl is crazy. Miss Logan. How good of you to come so quickly! Has Harris confessed that he's been following me? Why did he steal my father's corpse? Harris? Isn't that the man we picked up following a complaint from you? What do you mean? The psychopath that's going around opening graves. The monster! Listen to me. Since he came back to this town, Toby Harris has been working in the municipal dog pound. That's where he was the night they stole your father's corpse, busy gassing stray dogs. In other words, he has an alibi. But what about he photos I gave you? They prove he's been following me! You gave me those photos. There's no proof Harris took them. Are you calling me a liar? You might like to know, Mr. Harris has information that will interest you. Information he wants to give to you personally. - You didn't try to worm it out of him? - Me? What right have I got to do that? He's already paid his debt to society. This is incredible, you're on his side. You're a... Before you say something serious, just listen to me. The only one who's done something illegal is you, breaking into Harris' room the way you did. I could arrest you. Now, tell me, what am l? Toby Harris? Toby Harris! Inspector Potts says you have something to tell to me. What is it? Speak to me God damn it! What can you tell me about my father's death? That he deserved it. But I had nothing to do with it. You were with him at the boarding house. Why did he go to see you? Because I asked him to come. - To do what? - Nothing, I've done nothing. Oh no? You killed your wife. Somehow you're tied to my father's death. You worked for him, I know that. And that song? Why did you send it to me? It's a song that I sang you when you were a baby. Years ago I had a good job. But I got heavily into debt, and on top of that my wife drank. Things got a little better when she was pregnant. But after the baby was born she started drinking again. One night, the 13th of September, 1976, I came home from work late. She was euphoric, completely out of her mind. She was waving banknotes in my face. A lot of money. But my baby had disappeared. She had sold her. We struggled. I hit her. Then all of a sudden I saw smoke and fire. I don't know, I think the curtain must have caught on the gas ring. The whole house just went up so fast. I tried to save her, I swear to God I tried, just look at my face! I couldn't do anything! Harris, when you're finished, come to my house and clean up my dog's shit. What happened to the baby? She's still with the people who bought her. Millionaire couple. The woman couldn't have children, they told my wife. Do you know what your cellmates do to you if you've hurt kids? For only I knew the truth, that my baby was alive, in the hands of that fucking rich couple. Theodore Logan and his wife, Nana. You are my little girl. You're the baby they stole from me. You're crazy! I was born later, - a year after that. - It's a lie. They told you that in case I came back. Nana couldn't have children. That's ridiculous. Nana is my mother. She gave birth to me. More lies! I can prove it to you. Look! This is the brooch Nana was wearing on the 13th of September, 1976. The night they bought you. I've never seen it before. Of course not. How could you remember? My wife took a fancy to it and demanded it as part of the payment. Here, you have it. It's my legacy to you: the truth. Your whole life has been a lie. Except I am your father and I do love you. Search through your past. Search for the truth. Mum. I need your help. I need to know the truth about my life. What does it say here? It is the beginning of a Russian story, isn't it? You told it to me when I was a little girl. Who am I really? What happened on the 13th of September, 1976? I've got what you wanted to look at. Could you come with me, please? Here it is. Christmas, 1976. Three months after... - After what? - Do you know about her life in Russia? No, her medical history's incomplete. We know nothing about that period. Doctor, this is a ridiculous, but... Was my mother sterile? I don't know what you mean, a problem with the birth? No, no, if she was sterile before I was born. Doctor! Doctor! Nurse, quick, quick. - She's lost a lot of blood. - The bleeding won't stop. Where am l? What's happened? You fainted. In your mother's room. I'm terribly sorry. I know this isn't the right moment, but while you were unconscious, we found something untoward. Have you visited your gynaecologist recently? I'm having some tests done now. Good, good. I'm relieved to hear it. But could you tell your doctor to control the bleeding you're having? Now, I'm not an expert, but I think you have a fairly major infection. When can I go home? I'm keeping you in for a couple of days. The rest will do you good. There's nothing like smoking a cigar stolen from a dying person. Ain't that right, you old hag? Resting a bit, Daniella? As soon as I finish with the rest of the patients I'll bring you your pills. - Pills? - Sedatives. To make you sleep better. "Sleep my child." If you don't want your pills I'll buy them from you... with flies. Sedatives, four flies. Stimulants, five beetles. Five. Do you hear? Five! Nobody will give you more. That's pretty. "Sleep my child." Is that what it means? Watch out for the hag. She stole your photos. - Did you copy it from the photo? - Six is my last offer. It's written here. Take your sedatives and you'll sleep like a log until tomorrow. This lady, can she speak Russian? Can she read it? Oh, yes. She was born there. She's a very nice lady, very quiet. Not like that other patient. Come on, take your pills. You have a good rest. Fucking Doctor Grant. He takes our marmalade away. I've heard he's going to take away our vanilla ice cream. And our chocolate ice cream too. Fucking Doctor Grant! Fucking Doctor Grant! - But you, you are our saviour. - Saviour? - I am the saviour? - Yes, you. Bring us back our ice cream. Save us! Go on, go tell the others. Fucking Doctor Grant! He thinks he can take away our ice cream away. But I am the Saviour! - What are you doing, Johnny? - Fucking Doctor Grant! I am the saviour of mankind! Back to bed, fast. Fucking Doctor Grant! Daniella, look at the camera, love. Wave to Daddy. No, look, Mummy's got the camera. Hotel Excelsior? Father Elias Dranig. Go on, smile. Okay. Thanks. Shit! Today's your birthday, you're 8, a year for every rose in this bunch. I can't be there with you, but someone will see that you get this at the right time. Inside you will find your present. As always. Always, wherever I may be, happy birthday... Miss Logan, there's a parcel for you. They brought it this week. It's a big bunch of roses. Happy birthday, by the way. Miss Logan, are you all right? Better than ever. If you need anything... Raymond, They just called and said Chrysteen... Are you all right? No. It's only natural. Don't worry about it. I'm going to be there with you. Get your car and meet me at the door. I can almost feel your presence here, with me, as I make this terrible decision. I know it's hard to accept, maybe even incredible. But the crimes we commit finally catch up with us. The past. That ugly monster, the past. It all started on the 13th of September, 1976. Your mother was about to give birth. She was so happy. But we both knew only too well what our religious beliefs would oblige us to do. The baby that lived in her womb was to be born only to be strangled by its father. Strangled by me. Only a few days before the baby was due to be born, your mother lost the baby, a girl we had named Josephine. This terrible grief was aggravated by our anguish about the future. Our next baby would also have to be killed. Your mother couldn't handle that. It was she who remembered that an employee at our lab a simple man, a poor man and his wife had just had a baby girl. She sold us her baby, so I had a baby to kill in front of my fellow Abrahamites. That's the kind of man your father is. A traitor to his beliefs, a murderer of children. Your mother began suffering from deep depression. I was weighed down with guilt and grief. I only stayed alive for you, my loved one, light of my life. Everything would've ended like that, except the man Harris came back in search of his daughter. He couldn 't imagine that she died 25 years ago, sacrificed by me. He thinks you are his baby girl. However, because of his insistence, my fellow Abrahamites found out what really happened in 1976. And they now demand that I do what I had not done then: kill my first-born. You. If I am dead, you are safe. If I am dead, you live. So this is my birthday gift to you: life. Happy birthday, little Deedee. I love you. I will always love you. john told me you wanted to know who Toby Harris came to see the other day. - lt doesn't matter now. - He made a great scene. He was screaming and shouting. He was in a real state. They had to call me to throw him out. Even my boss congratulated me. - My father was good to his employees. - lt wasn't your father, Miss Logan. - Wasn't it? - No, Miss. It was Mr. Hastings who had the argument with Harris. They both looked very angry. Throwing Harris out was my first real action, out of the academy, I mean. Chrysteen. Daniella. - I've come to see... - Chrysteen, I suppose. Has the baby been born yet? Gabriel? His father's with him right now. Come in. Come in. Daniella has been kind enough to come and see Chrysteen. Where is she? I want to see the baby. - It's not the best of times. - Nonetheless, I insist. Simon, I must warn you. I know everything. My dear, what are you talking about? I know you know Harris. I know you are responsible for my father's death. That you ordered somebody to steal his dead body. And I know what all of you are going to do to Chrysteen's son. It was my father who told me. He explained everything and I have proof. You didn't expect that, did you? No, I must admit I didn't. My dear, all this can still be sorted out. Go home and rest. If I'm going anywhere,... it's to the police. You don't know what you're saying. Your illness is affecting you. My illness? What illness? What illness is he talking about? Tell her, Doctor. Through the fault of your father, you are a branch that should have never sprouted. Dr. Larabee had no other choice than to sterilise you. This has been painful for him and for me. But necessary. You are an insult to God. You're crazy. You're all crazy! Mrs. Hastings, you've been a mother. You are a mother. How can you stand for this monstrosity? Daniella. If you go upstairs there will be no turning back. You will have to face the consequences. Calm down. You killed my son. I'm sorry. Calm down. When you wake you'll see things different. - Well? - There's no question about it. He was strangled. God Almighty. Killing the son of her best friend. Maybe the envy drove her crazy. She was sterile, wasn't she? Her mental disorder is much more serious than plain envy. What will happen to her now? Who knows? She still hasn't recovered from her nervous fit Hastings' house after killing the baby. Maybe she never will recover. Might be better for her if she didn't. I feel like a drink. Want to join me? Thanks Henry, but I have some work that I still need to do. Silently night has come. Little lights are stars. Lazy, the moon arises. You've got a visitor. Your father's come to see you. Sleep quietly, sleep, my child. Fly to the land of dreams. Sleep quietly, sleep, my child. Dogs will keep you safe. Birds will keep you warm. You deserve all the love the world can give a child. My child. Sleep, quietly sleep, my child. Fly to land of dreams. Sleep quietly, sleep, my child.
