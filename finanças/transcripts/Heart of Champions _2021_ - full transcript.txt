De-rig the boat! Settle down, Alex. Next time I say take it up, you take it up. No back talk. Taking it up that early wasn't part of the race plan, was it? I made the call. It's your job to follow me, John. Exactly, you made the call. What are you trying to say, John? It's my fault we lost? Alex! That was a goddamn embarrassment. You think you can finish the season like that and still make the Olympic team? Tryouts are a year away, Dad. Let me tell you something. The Olympic coaches are already watching you. I'll win it next year. One two! Harvard! We are gods! We are rowing gods! Wooo! Harvard dirtbags. They're the national champs, again. All right, hand them over pussies. Yeah. Let's go. Wooo! Easy. I knew they were going to break. we got a new coach. Had a new coach last year. This year will be different. No it won't! Alex'll pull the same bullshit again. Who are you? You must be the transfer, Chris, right? Yeah. Hey, man, I'm John. Welcome. I'm your roommate, so. This is a private conversation. He needs to leave. Chill, Ted, all right. He's part of the team. Don't remember seeing him in the boat last season. Why are you being such an ass? It's okay. I'll just wait outside. Sorry, dude. Sure you don't need help? I got it. Oh. I got it. Got it. This your girlfriend? Not anymore. Your room is the second one on the right. I'll be back in like an hour. First practice tomorrow. Assuming we still have a team. I don't know how to row. So please teach me all you know. I don't know, how to row. So please teach me all you know. Jayvee crew, go see Charlie. Move out, giddy up. Yee ha! Okay. Logan Sanchez, you're Jayvee. - What? - Why? Jayvee! Go see Charlie. Come on, Alex. Move out fresh meat. Easy Alex, this is Chris. He's the new transfer. Yo, John. You all are late. I knew I got through to you guys. You're late for practice. Knock out a hundred. We're not late. You're early. Get on your face and push. Oh, not the finger, Ted. Keep that up and I'll break it off. - Yeah, go ahead. - Oh hey, hey, hey! How about I do the push ups. How about that? Varsity! Line up on the deck. Hurry up! I'm your new coach. You will address me as Coach Murphy. Can someone explain to me why you're here? Uh, we're a rowing team and you asked us to come meet you here, so. That's not what I'm asking. I want to know why you're here. What's your name? Alex Singleton. Captain of the crew. All right, Captain, tell me why you're here. We're here to practice. Here is our lineup. Uh, and the workout schedule. We're going to get on the water now. You're not ready for the water. Sit your ass down, Singleton. All of you, sit. Pass these around, all right? Here's some pencils. I want you all to write down why you, personally, are here. Start with the words, "I am here to..." and then figure out the rest. It's not a dissertation, hurry up. Who wants to read theirs? You. Stand up. Introduce yourself. Uh, Ted Taylor. Give me your card. I am here to meet the new coach. Nice to meet you, Taylor. Now tell me why you're really here. To steer the boat. You can steer boats in a bathtub. That's not why you're here. Sit. Pass your cards, up. What's your name? Chris Davenport. Come to my office afterwards. No. Uh-Uh. Nope. No! No! Unbelievable. Not one of you knows why you're here. Let's try a different approach. Look around. What is this place? You, Mohawk, don't say hair salon. It's a boathouse. Think bigger picture and the bigger picture is...? Belston University. I'm John Kimball. So, now tell me, Kimball, why are you at this university? To learn. - To learn about what? - Rowing. You already know how to row. At least I hope so. All right, let me end the suspense. No man is an island. No man is an island. Whatever you do after graduation, you have to find your way with the people around you. They need to rely on you and you need to rely on them. Because the time may come when your success, your happiness, maybe even your flesh and blood survival will be at stake. And you won't make it on your own. So, yes, Kimball, you are here to learn. You are going to learn something that can't be taught in a book or a classroom. Out on that river, men, you will learn how to be a team. Not an island. We already are a team. Not true. A team doesn't disintegrate in the last 500 meters against Harvard and then point fingers at who to blame. Yeah, I saw that race. Don't forget what I just told you. You are here to learn one of the most important lessons in life. How to work together to achieve the impossible... as a team. Have a seat, Davenport. I'm not much older than you in that photo. My father was in the army. He never talked about it much. For a long time, I was the same way. Have a seat. So I saw you row stroke in the Wisconsin boat a couple of years back. You guys were fast. I guess. Then I couldn't find your name on the roster from last year, so I called the coach. He told me the story. Don't want to talk about it. Fair enough. You wrote, I'm here because I have to be. What does that mean? I got a rowing scholarship. I need to row for my tuition. Otherwise, you'd quit the team? - Yeah. - Why? Because I fucking hate rowing. So you're just going to go through the motions? Just put me on junior varsity. Going through the motions will be good enough there. And then the lesson you learn is how to waste your talent, drift along and take the easy way out. Right? I'm keeping you on varsity. Don't you even think about slacking off. I have no problem revoking your scholarship. Sarah, okay. Honestly, these are fantastic. They have such great composition. Hey, Nish. Hi, how are you? Good. This was in the mail room. Thank you. Finally. What is it? Um, it is the Rhodes application. So, you're really going for it? Um-hmm. There's Alex. - Oh god. - Oh my god. Sara. I missed you too. Hi Nish. Hi Lili. How was your summer? Hi Nish. Hi, Lili. How was your summer? Glad to be back. Yeah, me too. - Should we go? - Yes. Since we're no longer wanted here. Should we go register? because there's this wonderful Shakespeare seminar, I really want to introduce you to. Tomorrow and tomorrow, and tomorrow, creeps in this... Oh sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Hey, Chris. Hey. Let me take him to the boathouse, all right. Okay. - See you tonight. - See you tonight. Come on. Hey, there he is. Jack, meet Travis Murphy. Class of 67 and our new varsity crew Coach. Travis, President Harris. Great to have you back on campus. You know well as anyone what rowing means to Belston. Our big donors and alums expect great things. I can promise we'll work hard. Well, anything you need, the door's open. Feels like 100 years ago, doesn't it? We had a good boat. Yeah, we did. How's it feel to be back on campus? Still some ghosts here. Yeah, well, I see him too, sometimes. Do you? Travis, I'm glad I got you to take this job. But let's try and focus on the future instead of the past. Just to be clear, it wasn't you who got me to take this job. Okay. Pete Davenport's boy, I stand corrected. One more thing, Alex is gunning for a seat in the Olympic boat next year. So that's why you hired me. You're a hell of a coach, Murph. I know you can get him there. If he gets a little extra attention. Everybody in the boat gets my complete attention. We're glad to have you here. Welcome aboard. Who's the leader of this crew? I'm the captain. I asked, who's the leader? Me. You got something to say, John? All right. Singleton, you run a practice. Looks like our war hero has already folded. All right, let's go. 20 minute piece. Newbie you're in five. The rest of you all know the lineup. Hold up a minute. What's that for? Well, if I see black tape, that means you're moving pretty well. What if you see the purple? Oh, I doubt I'll ever see the purple. Yeah, but what if you do? Son, if I see the purple tape, this boat sprouted wings. Sloppy. Sloppy. Sloppy. Going off your stroke rate. Sloppy. Time's up! Weigh enough! And balance! Down. God weak. Since you guys can't balance, we're doing another one. Turn it around. Hey, what are we trying to accomplish? Another one, John. That's what we're trying to accomplish. Quiet in the boat. Wait here. What the hell is he doing? Five minute piece. Try and catch me. Who's he kidding? He can't beat us in a single. Who cares, let's crush him. Ready all! Row! Drive. Drive. Two lengths down. Time's up. Weigh enough. And down. Take it in. Someone want to tell me what went wrong at practice today? We started off okay. No you didn't. You started like shit and you finished like a big steaming pile of shit. You couldn't catch an old man in a single. Wearing khakis! What are you snickering about? I should make all you surrender your shirts for losing like that. So, you're the leader of this team? Yeah. Why? Because I got the top rowing machine score? Rowing machines measure endurance son. Not leadership. Leadership is measured in the hearts of those who follow. Nobody was following you. Carter, can you tell me what the purpose of this team is? Uh. It's like you said yesterday, to learn how to work as a team. No. Listen to yourself, buddy. The purpose of this team is to learn how to work as a team. That makes no sense. Each of you individually is here to learn, but the team itself needs a purpose. Singleton, did you give 'em one? Yeah, one 20 minute piece. That's a task, not a purpose. We've got a purpose. Get used by Alex as a stepping stone so he can make the Olympic squad. You gonna hold up that big bad finger, Ted? Quiet! I want somebody tell me right now. What is the purpose of this team? It's goal, it's mission. To win the national championship. We have to beat Harvard. That's never going to happen. Kimball, you grab that broken oar, the rest of you follow me. Kimball, break the glass. Unless one of you has the key. Go on. Break the glass. Oh! Nice. Pass 'em around. Let's put them on the wall. So, there are nine of you. Nine Harvard shirts on this wall. As we move through the season, the team will choose the man most deserving to step up and take a shirt. What is the mission of this crew, again? To beat Harvard, sir. Every single one of you needs to commit to this. Raise your hand if you do. Don't blindly throw your arm up like you're saluting some dictator. I want you to think it over. Decide. Is this an honorable goal? Decide if this is worth your sweat, blood and tears. What the hell are you doing man? I'm studying. Put that book away. It's Saturday night. You're making everybody else look bad by staying in. Now let's go out with the team and have some team bonding. Come on, let's go. John. No thanks. What? Mommy and Daddy ground you man? Come on. My Mom and Dad died in a car accident. Wait really? Yeah, really. Dude, I'm... I'm so sorry, man, I didn't-I didn't. Forget about it. Just let me study. I'm studying. I gotta apologize, man, because I had no idea. Foot in my mouth, dude. Hey, let's just go out with the team, man. Let's have some fun. - John. - Yeah? I am not leaving this chair. Okay. Here. Another. You drag me out for team bonding and you won't have a beer? No. Why? I quit drinking. Why? You know what it feels like to get stabbed? No. Yeah, neither do I. But I should. Damn. What happened? I wish I could tell you. I don't remember. Well, that's okay, I'll drink for the two of us. You ought to slow down. I can handle it. I got nobody to lose. Hey. Chris, that's Nisha. We call her Nish. This is Lili. And you remember Sara. Do I know you? Oh, sorry. Okay. Holy shit. What's that? That right there is the old loch. Yeah. Connects the two rivers. Let's go. We got an old tradition. Before every season, the whole team sneaks up here and we throw our old racing shirts into the water to appease the river gods. Is there problem here? Hey. Sorry, sir, no problem. We're just taking a look. Come on. Chris man, how you doing? How's your head? I'm never going out again. Was that your plan? To get blasted and act like an idiot, so we never drag you out again? No. You were also pretty rude to Nish last night. Who's Nish? She's just like my best friend, so. Oh. Sorry. It's not us you need to apologize to. Are you stalking me? How dare you come here? This is my apology. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm calling security, because honestly, after the other night. Please use my phone. Or what? Pig with a phone? Alcoholic dumb jock misogynist pig. You left out "villain of the earth." I'm sorry, what? Villain of the earth. You left that out. Can you please just leave? Let's go out and have fun. I can't. I'm knee deep in Rhodes application stuff. Wish I could. Okay. Oh, what's this? What is this? Hmm, it's from that pig at the bar. John says he's a nice guy. Not a chance. Eno, 4.6 30-40? Dumb jock is mocking me, testing my Shakespeare. Can I see? Start on line 30, "I am alone, the villain of the earth." Read all the way to the bottom. Don't think he's mocking you. No, he's not. What was his name again? Stand between the rope. Slip a loop over each ankle. It's about a five mile run to the chapel and back. Begin. Begin! Start running! Three, two, one, go! What's the matter, Davenport? All right. How about we walk first, then run? Let's do right foot on three, ready? One, two, three. Left foot. One, two, three. One, two, three. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. So, what we learn? Total concentration. Exactly. You bring that level of concentration with you back on the water. It's bullshit. Davenport? You don't look too happy. Say what's on your mind, son. I could've got a better workout running alone. You think so? Yeah. That way, nobody drags me down and I go where I want. Let's get on the water. All right, Taylor, stop here. Everyone except Davenport get out and swim to shore. What? Let me rephrase that, everyone except Davenport get out and swim to shore. Jake, how about you start it off? In you go. In you go. All right, Jake, you got it, buddy. Coach? Come on, buddy. - Good luck, buddy. - Gotta man up. - Right behind ya. - Balance the boat. Come on. Lean away. Come on, Jake. There you go. There you go. That's it. All right everybody else. Out of the boat. Come on. I don't see the point in this, Coach. Ben, I can still see ya. Come on Taylor. Oh. Okay, Davenport, row the boat back to shore. How? That's your problem. Row it back. Hurry up. I thought you said you could move faster alone. This is different. You're damn right it is. A lot more like real life. Okay, lesson over. Get out there and help, Davenport. - What? - Ah, shit! And down. One minute rest, then keep going. 2,000 meter race, gentlemen, only lasts six minutes, but rowing packs more pain into those six minutes than most other sports do in a year. Need to constantly train body and mind to prepare for the ordeal. And balance and down. I've never been this far down river before. Nobody has. One minute rest then keep going. One minute rest then keep going. One minute rest then keep going. I know your hands are raw meat. Lungs are burning and you all hate me right now. Weigh enough. And balance. Come on, balance the boat. And down. Okay, Taylor, turn them around. It's 15 miles back to the dock. Should take an hour and 20 minutes. We're all gonna die. We're gonna make it. Quit stalling, Taylor. Ready all? Row. You may be suffering, but you're suffering together. And together you achieve something that should not even be possible. That is the miracle of a crew. That's it Taylor. Finish with pride! Weigh enough and balance. Hold it. Outstanding! And down. Men, congratulations. I thought it'd be more than you could handle, but you showed impressive endurance and discipline. Kimball. Good motivation at the end. Hey you free tonight? No, I really got to work on this. How about you come out with me and Sarah and Nish, instead. I know about the flowers. It wasn't exactly accepted. Yeah, well, nothing is exactly anything with Nish, okay? Come on, we'll go down by the river. It'll be fun. I'm sure she hates me. I really got to focus on this, man. What are you doing? Oh, there's some fire in there. There's the anger, you want to get it out with fisticuffs? Who the hell says fisticuffs? Come on. Are you two going to say anything? Okay, Chris here can recite some Shakespeare for us, since he seems to know so well. There's a good idea. Nish, aren't you a little cold? What a guy. Thank you. Chris, some advice, don't hand a girl your jacket, cuddle up next to her to keep her warm. Oh, yeah. Okay, I'm going to change the subject. Isn't it boring just rowing up and down that river every day? Boring? Same thing every day. No, no. When we're all rowing well, when we have swing, I could literally stay out there forever. What's swing? It's pretty much what rowing is all about. No other sport has anything like it. Is it something you see? No, it's something you feel, okay? Everyone in the boat feels it. I know it's kind of hard. It's hard to explain. Swings an excuse. What? You hear it when someone screws up or slacks off - and the boat is slow. - No. Trying to blame someone else for what's really his own fault. All right, look, Nisha. Swing is when the whole team is rowing in perfect sync, okay? You can literally feel it. Everyone's connected to the motion and to the moment. Okay, the boat is as light as a feather. It's just gliding across the water. It's, um, it's like the wind on the river. Um, Chris still looks skeptical, so I don't know guys. I don't buy the ghost in the boat stuff. It's just eight guys rowing, all mechanical, nothing more. What you got going on here? He's racing Arnold. Who is Arnold? Arnold is our computer pacesetter. Woohoo! Color me impressed, Singleton. Glad you saw it. Yeah, I'm sure you are. More witnesses, right? - That's right. - Congrats. What are you doing? I broke it. Alex won't let me leave till I fix it. Let me give it a shot. Thanks. Hey newbie, what the hell you doing? Sanchez is supposed to fix that. Looks like Chris just did. So we can leave now? Test it out first then you can leave. I'll test it. Set it for something quick. Two hundred meters. Twenty-nine seconds. Wearing corduroys. You've been hiding skills from us, Chris. That's fast enough to even make Alex nervous. Two hundred meters, try 2,000 then we can talk. It's fixed. Come on, let's go. Yeah, let's go. Hey congrats, man. - Yeah, you too. - Really, really impressive. Thanks, thanks. They're re-rigging the boat. Are you changing the lineup? Yeah, Kimball is stroke today, you're in seven. Why are you switching me? I want to see how the boat moves with Kimball in stroke. At the end of practice, we're going to try this new drill he came up with. He'll lead it. You sneaky piece of shit. Hey! You knock that shit off. You want to fight somebody, you can fight me. I guarantee you'll regret it. He invented some bullshit drill to get me demoted to seven. Not true. I told him I was making the change yesterday. He suggested the drill today. Kimball, in fact, asked me not to switch you. Now, Kimball, this is your chance to see if you can do any better. Yes, sir. And Singleton, I expect you to work just as hard in seven as Kimball did for you. A team player gives 100 percent no matter where he sits. You man enough to do that? - Do I have your word? - Yes. Let's get on the water. Looking good guys. Go. Time. Weigh enough. Hey, we're consistently faster with you in stroke. Okay, Kimball, you're up. All right, listen up. We're gonna do something a little differently. We're gonna row with blindfolds. Blindfolds? Yup. It's a little swing drill, I invented. You got that Chris? Swing drill. This is gonna be a disaster. Stop pouting, Alex. Shut up. Hey, watch your mouth. Quiet in the boat! Young lady. Sorry, Coach. You guys got the blindfolds on? No, hang on. Just a simple knot, Diver. I'm good. All right, ready all. Row. Weigh enough. Who caught the crab? Chris. So much for your idiotic drill. Singleton, remember your promise. Try again. Ready all. Come on guys. Row! - Lance! That's twice! - Weigh enough. Dude, I can't see. No shit. Guys. You gotta focus. What's the point? We don't race blindfolded. All right, look, guys. All right, if we practice blindfolded, think how much better we'll race when we can see. Now don't be so self-absorbed, visualize us moving together. We'll move as a crew if you let yourself feel the swing. All eight, sit ready. All right, deep breaths, guys, Deep breaths. - And Row. - Nice and easy. Feel that swing. There we go. That's it. Full pressure. All right, crank it up, guys. Full pressure on this one. That's it, wohoohoohoo! Yeah! Yes! Hey we had some good swing there for a minute. I know you felt that. Yeah, maybe next time. Yeah, maybe next time. Alex. Hey, I appreciate that extra effort today. Enjoy it while it lasts cause I'm gonna get my seat back. Yeah, you gonna go cry to daddy? He'll find out one way or another. Coach Murphy is doing a good job. It'll slow the boat down if he mysteriously "resigns." Not my call. Team chooses John. If it's all right with you, I'd like to go last. Sure, John, who would you like to nominate? I'm thinking Ted Taylor. All right, Ted, grab a shirt. Hey good one. Nice one. Go! Tan-da-da-dan-dan-da! Nice. I saw you on the water today. What are you doing in seven? Coach swapped me and John. Is he going to switch you back? I don't know. This is unacceptable. The Olympic coaches need to see you in stroke. What do you want me to do? Nothing, I'll handle it. Hey. Hey. Okay, instead of sneaking glances, should we just do like a staring contest or something? Okay. Three, two, one. Oh, you blinked. Okay, let's do it again. Okay. - Ready now? - Umm-hmm. Okay. One. Two. Three. You blinked, then I blinked. Fine, let's go again. - Okay. - Okay. - The trick is to... - Let's do it again. - Okay. - Let's try again. I'll count down. Three, two, one. Hey, bro, it's snowing, it's snowing. Hey, everybody, come on, it's snowing. Let's go. What's going on? It's a school tradition. Is that the guy that never left college? Should we go see? School tradition on first snowfall of the year. But there's only like five snowflakes. It literally takes only one and they're out here for the nude Olympics. - Look at them. - Woooo! MJ! What are you doing? Participating, brother. Go on, have a sip. Oh, okay. What is this? Brandy. Yeah, drink yourself a jacket. - Ugh. - Yeah. That'll keep you warm. Keep you warm. All right well, good luck, lovers. Cheerio! Am I the only naked one in this whole bloody Olympics? Wait, are you actually getting undressed? Seems like fun! But it's cold. Isn't that the point? Yeah... Come on. Oh my god! It's freezing! Oh. Oh. Oh my God. You're shivering. It's freezing. - It was your idea. - Was it? - Yeah, it was your idea. - Hmm. Serious chat for a minute? You should know that there's really no long future here because I'll graduate in the spring. I know. Yeah and then I leave the country. Rhodes scholarship, I know. I plan to go home because this was really just like study abroad for me. Nish, we spent one night together. I know, yeah no, for sure. It's just... Hey Ni... Wow, okay. That's great. Hi, Chris. Nice to see you guys. Yeah. Cool. Locking up for the winter? Yeah. I wanted to talk before the holidays. About the lineup? Look, I realize season isn't until spring, so there's a temptation to play with the lineup. However, I can assure you... Kimball will stay in stroke. Your son will stay in seven. Alex is the best you've got. Your son's a good oarsman, but the boat's faster with Kimball in stroke. Come on, Travis. Look, even if you're right, the boat's going to be what? One, two seconds faster, only to crush Alex's chances for the Olympics. This isn't about Alex. It's about the team. I'm not going to let you sacrifice my son's future. Yeah, I'm well aware of your views on sacrifice. Oh, there it is. That same self-righteousness you had in college. Only, you always seem to forget that your ideas about sacrifice can hurt other people. I don't forget. I remember every single day. All you had to do was sign that paper. Defer the draft. Becker. Marino. They only enlisted because you did. Each of those men did what they thought was right. No, they did what you thought was right. Yeah, of course, you still believe that, you can't comprehend putting anything ahead of yourself. Yeah? Well, it's too bad you didn't all make it back home. I wish we could ask our dead friends which one of us is right. Now, I'm done arguing with you when the team is back on the water in spring, you put Alex back in stroke. If you don't, I'll find a coach who will. You came back early. Well, I told you I'd send a postcard. Plus if something happened to you during Y2K I would never forgive myself. Wow. It's really good. Okay, so for the Rhodes essay, really good is more of a floor than a ceiling, but I'll take it. No, I mean it. I think they say that in the rejection letter actually, we regret to inform that your application is really good. Try harder next year. Most guys would say that was perfect, just so they could start round two with me sooner, so... Nish... It's perfect. You're so stupid. No, I'm serious. I think we're going to ring in the new millennium from your bed. It's much more fun to spend New Year's with you here, rather than boring ol' mum and dad in London. I'm sorry. - It's fine. - I shouldn't have said that. Tell me about your mom and dad. My mum and dad? Yes, your mum and dad. Your accent is rubbish! No, my accent is bloody brilliant. - It's not, it's rubbish. - I sound exactly like you. You do not sound like me. - Will you stop? - Mine was better than yours. Oh, yes. Could I actually just keep this one? - Are you falling for him? - No. You're falling for him. No, I'm not at all. It's a good picture. Oh, hello. Who's that? Oh... It looks like we are going to have a class together. You don't need to sit down. You can actually just leave. This isn't an ancient history seminar. I don't know if you got confused. Oh, burn. It's a free country. I can take a class if I want to. You can take a class, but you can't take a hint? Leave her alone. You've really become a persistent pest. Wow. Nisha. Don't be such a royal bitch, maybe? Okay. Alex. Hey, Alex. Alex. I haven't said anything because Sara asked me not to, but now I'm asking politely, leave her alone. She's with me. Yeah, after you slid in there and stole her like the loyal friend you are. She's with me. And you're going to back off, you got that? You gonna lose your cool, John? Huh? - Leave her alone... - Get out of my face. Coach, why aren't you stopping them? Why aren't you? Get 'em off! Solve your problems? Yeah, just dandy. What was that? Nothing. 2,000 meters, both of you. Better use of your energy. Go on! I'm gonna blow your doors off. Row! Gotta make your move now, John. Come on, John. You got this. Gotta make your move now, John. Make your move now! There you go. You've got this. Bring it home. There you go. Time! Good job, bro. That's what I'm talking about. Same lineup we left off with. Start off with 2,000 meter piece... Let's try to keep the stroke rate at 30, all right? All right, push off. All right, hands on. Murphy is failing to prepare them. I'm trying to save the rowing program. Season hasn't even started. But I can assure you, this is the right move. Mike, there was grumbling from the alumni about what you did last year. If I let you do it again, before the season even starts there'll be a lot of questions. Questions about you, not the new coach. Let him finish the season. Look, you ease up at practice, just a hair slower. First thing Murphy will try is to switch you back. You want me to slow the boat down? How about kissing the Olympics goodbye, huh? Or betting your entire future on some crappy college transcript. Does that feel better? No, I just... Son, you could be the best oarsman in the country and the only way anybody's going to see that is if you get your damn seat back. I promised the team I'd give them 100%. Oh yeah? Well this is your shot. Okay? It's not theirs. And you have to take it. No one else is going to make this happen for you. Not the team. Certainly not Murphy. You understand? Yeah. Do you understand? Yes. Good. You'll thank me for this. Singleton, you're late. Lance, what the hell? Now you're late. How many times do I need to say it? Times up, weigh enough. It's that bad? Take 'em in, Taylor, we're just wasting our time out here. I saw good leaders. Good men killed in action. Not because they made a mistake. A bullet or a piece of shrapnel just happened to catch 'em. That's the nature of combat. Other times guys made mistakes and men died. Mistakes happen under pressure. That's also the nature of combat. But there's a third way I saw men killed. When someone wasn't willing to pull their weight. And no matter how hard I worked to make up for it, wasn't always enough. Singleton, I thought you were a man of your word. I see I'm wrong. And you share some of the blame Kimball. You're the leader of this team. You're keeping them shut out. Sir, I tried to pull him back in. Half-heartedly. You two are the stern pair. You're the team within the team. The other guys follow you. That's both a privilege and a responsibility because if you refuse to work together then the team can't work together. And if you won't put aside your egos and resolve this then I want you to go out there right now, look your teammates in the eye and tell them not to bother showing up for practice anymore. You decide. Alex, don't you think we should talk? It's pretty simple. I'll give the team a 100 percent. You'll stay in stroke. Well, break it down, get me the cost analysis. Hang on. He switch you back? I did what you wanted, and I realized coach Murphy is right. I was willing to slack off. Shows I didn't deserve to be in stroke seat in the first place. Alex... Boat's faster with John in stroke, Dad. I'll stay in seven seat. The Olympic coaches can see me there and I'll be able to sleep at night. We're gonna race. This'll be a cake walk. I get a five minute head start. Check that. Not a cake walk. Five minutes?! Dude, there's no way we catch him. Yes we can, just follow John. Let's blow the doors off this old man. Ready all! Row! Eight lengths up, but we're flying. Big 10 in 2, that's one. That's two. That's it, boys! Stay strong. Stop here. Look around, take in the moment. This was your classroom. You're ready to race. All right boys, time to feed the river gods. Hey Alex, why don't you give the command? Are you guys ready? Throw on two... One... Two! Row! Drive! Find the rhythm! Find the rhythm! That's it, that's it. Drive... We're walking! MJ, grab a shirt. Smells like shit. Yeah, newbie! - Alex Singleton! - Yeah! Hi. I don't want to bother you. I just wanted to apologize... for being such a persistent pest. Thank you. Alex, do you have a date for the graduation ball? Uh, no. Neither does Lili. Sara... She does now. I mean if you... if you'll have me. All right. What's wrong? Look at what just came in the mail. You didn't open it? Why bother? I mean, look how small the envelope is. That doesn't mean anything. I suppose on the long list of life's tragedies not getting the Rhodes is at the very bottom. I suppose I could just go back to London, and you know, put on my big girl pants and get a real job. Hey, hey... You can do anything you want, go wherever you want to go. You're a rockstar. It's all gonna be fine. Okay? Okay. Thank you. Okay, do you want to get in the shower, - and I'll get changed. - Okay. We'll get me that ice cream. All right, listen up. The bus leaves tomorrow morning, 6:00 a.m. sharp. I know you're getting dolled up in your rental tuxedos for some graduation thing tonight. I want you to go early, sip a half-glass of champagne and leave early. This is the last race before championships. You have a perfect record. Let's keep it that way. - All right? - Yes, sir. - Kimball. - Yeah? Sir? National team coaches called me today. You interested in Olympic camp this summer? Am I interested in rowing for USA? I take that as a yes. Yes sir. Did Alex get an invite? That's a conversation I'll have to manage after the race. Did you see our last race? I did. We're fast. You know, there's no greater feeling than the pride a father feels for his son. And you took that away from me. The Olympic coaches made their calls today. I can still go to tryouts. They'd just send you home after the first day. - You don't know that. - Yeah, I do know that. So what are you going to do after they send you home? You got a plan? You have a job lined up? No. Oh, you know who they did invite? Kimball. That's right. Kimball got your invitation. He's going to row in the Olympics. Dad. You know what all you had to do was listen to me. You know, maybe he really is the better man. Sara clearly thinks so. I have a slight announcement to make. Bam! - Oh. - We did it! Congrats. Appreciate it, thank you, thank you, couldn't have done it without you. You look beautiful. Thank you. Y'all ready? We're gonna dance, what's up. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. Okay, so I've been thinking, do you want me to stay here with you after I graduate? I thought you wanted to go back home. That was before I realized I was falling in love with you. Are you falling in love with me? Okay. How many times did you tell me the Rhodes is your dream and you're going back to England? Then you didn't get it, and suddenly I'm your fallback option? No, that's not what's hap... So what, is there somebody else? Or what? No. John mentioned that you have an ex-girlfriend back in Wisconsin. So did you get back together with her? Why do I have to pry everything out of you? You should go back home. Did she break your heart? Is that what happened? You're so sad. You're so pathetic. She broke your heart, you can't let anyone else back in again? Is that what happened, Chris? Yeah, Nish. She did break my heart. She was in the car with my parents. I... I didn't... I didn't know. My God, why didn't you talk about this before? Why didn't you say anything? 'Cause talking won't bring anybody back. Chris, talking can help you move past it. I'm trying to get past it, I really am. But every time I row, it reminds me they're gone. Why? Because I insisted they come watch some stupid race. It's always been about me and rowing. You can't just hold on to all of that. Chris, you can talk to me. Can you say something please? You should go back home. Tell everyone inside that I feel sick. and I just want to go home. Hey. Hey, I'm sorry Alex, I don't drink. - Sorry. I forgot. - No, no worries. I just thought the occasion deserved a toast. Sara told you? Told me what? Told me what? We got engaged, man. Wow. No, Sara did not tell me. I'm sorry. I thought the way you... No, dude. Congrats. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. You got it all, man. Stroke seat. Sara. - The Olympics. - Oh, coach told you? My dad told me. Congrats again. Thank you. What did you want to toast? Uh, to a great team. Forget it. To a great team. And a great stern pair. Get this out of here before Sara sees. - Hey. - Hey. Why do you taste like champagne? Do I? Hey, I'm going back to my room. - Why? - What happened, where's Nish? We broke up. Chris... Listen... where are you going, Sara? We'll talk later. Wow, what a great party. I'm tipsy. You okay? Yeah, long night. - Talk about it tomorrow? - Sure. Oh my god. I think I've had enough tonight. No. Get hideously drunk with me please. That's a good girl. Oh god. Sara? You okay? All right, let's get you to bed. Come on. Come on. There you go. Okay. John? John. What're you doing? Stay out of this. What? Open up! - Is John here? - No, what's going on? Where'd he go? I don't know. He tore down all his shirts and stormed out. He's drinking. Alex! What the hell are you doing, John? Huh? Listen to me. It's not what you think, all right? John, stop. It's not what you think, John. Okay? God damn it. Stay down. Put your hands on your head and take two steps back. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. Whoa. Now. - Officer it's, it's not what... - No! Stop! John! Shit. John? John? John? I can't find him! I can't find him! John! John! John! Where is he? John? John? We'll find the body at sun-up. The kid won't quit. Get in the boat. No. Come on, now, get in the boat. No, I can save him. I can save him. John? No, he's gone, you keep diving like that, you're gonna end up at the bottom with him. Now get in this boat, Chris. Come on, come on, come on, now. Hey. Look Alex, you can't blame yourself for this. You tried to save him. Okay, the best thing you can do right now is to get back on the water. The championships are this weekend. You focus on that, not this. I'm not rowing. What do you mean you're not rowing? If you don't row this weekend, son, you can really kiss the Olympics goodbye. Are you kidding me? I can't face them. All right. Okay. You're not going to row. Nobody's going to row. Don't touch it. I just don't get what happened. It was Alex. Nobody wants to say it, but we're all thinking it. Gentlemen, let's have a seat please. Where's Coach Murphy? He resigned after the service. He's no longer your coach. Well, as you're aware, the championship is in a few days and in light of this tragedy, President Harris and I had a conversation as to whether competition was appropriate. After careful consideration, we've decided it's best if you withdraw, I'm sure you understand. It's better if we race. You still wanna race? What's that going to change? You want to race? Go without me. I'm out. Then we're agreed. Heard the team decided not to race. You resigned. No, they forced me out. None of it matters now. You sure? John was the team. Rowing a boat for six minutes won't bring him back. Yeah. Race is only six minutes, right? How could that possibly matter? But what if the race was 60 minutes or 60 days or 60 years? Would it matter then? I rowed in a boat with your father way back when at the Olympic tryouts. He was a good oarsman, good man. We got drafted into the army together. You said your dad didn't talk about the army. I understand why. Everyone says thank you, calls you a hero, tries to make you feel better. It just made me feel more alone. I wasn't a hero. I was just trying to save my friends and I failed them. And afterwards, from time to time, I'd asked myself why bother anymore? And then one day I realized I shouldn't ask myself. I should ask them. If they could come back, somehow, get a little more life, little more time, would they? Would they come back even if it meant constant guilt, constant pain? And I knew their answer would be yes, even if it was only for six minutes. Even if it was with their hands blistered, and their lungs burning, their souls shattered. They'd come back. A loss is not the end. Don't make it into one. These are for you. What's this? They'll follow. If you lead. Chris? Chris, please open the door. I know you're in there. Sara made this gift for you. And well, it was supposed to be for John, but she asked me to give it to you to help you remember good times. Chris, I'd really like to hand it to you. Okay. I'll just leave it here then. I go back to London tomorrow but... I really do wish you so much happiness and no more heartbreak. What I said before was wrong. I'm sorry. John was the heart of this team and we lost him. But our team is still here. We need to race. What are you talking about? The race is today. There's no way we beat Harvard now. We're gonna race. Why are they here? We need two more to fill out the boat. Chris. We can't win, you know that. I'll tell you what I know. I know what it's like to be alone in a boat with a bunch of empty seats. I know I miss John. That's a... big, big hole. We have one more race. to make that hole a little bit smaller. I wanna row one more time with eight of you. Together. As a team. Who's with me? Who's with me? Okay. I'm in. Me too. What the hell. All right. This one's old. I want new ones. All right, let's get hands on. Up to heads and go. Gentleman, put the boat down. You're not racing. Split. Yes, we are. I've just left the regatta director, your entry has been withdrawn. Put it down. You'll all be charged with theft of university property. Let them race, dad. If you care about me at all you'll let them race. Go around him. It's okay. Go. Stern to me. Sit ready. Hang! Build! Twenty high! Go! Legs, chaaa! Legs, chaaa! In the pop! Nice. And that's our big 20. Go now. Sit up. Stay relaxed. Yeah. Still moving. Yeah! That's it! That's it! Drive! Drive! Okay boys, we're in good position. I got five seats. Give me six now. Chris, we gotta take it up. Not yet. Match their move! We're a length up on everyone but Harvard! It's just us and them! Us and them! There it is, there it is. In the fingers, in the fingers. Yeah! Swing back. Swing back. Swing back. Legs, chaaa! That's it boys! Commit! Match their move! Chris, we gotta take it up now. Not yet. We're a length down. Holding at a length down. Hold for our move. Hold for our move. Holding. Up now! Let's take it up! Let's get it back! Up two in two. One! Two! Push now! Harvard's calling a push! Match their move! Match their move! That's it! Keep walking! Give me that four seat! We're walking! Give me that three seat! More. More. Three seats! And walking! Find it! Dig it! Take it back! Take it back! That's you, MJ! Legs Chaaa! Legs Chaaa! Legs Chaaa! Clean. Good. We're the national champions. In two, ten to break. Go! One! Yeah! There it is. We're gone. They're done! Ted. Eyes closed. What? Eyes closed. Okay, boys. Listen up. Close your eyes. Eyes closed. Close your eyes. It's raining. Are you gonna say anything? I wish it was snowing.
