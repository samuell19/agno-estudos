a NIKOS NIKOLAIDIS film Νow I suppose, I should give you some explanation. Αlthough that is something we don't deserve. What I mean is... ...whenever I started something, you always knew how to finish it. Sometimes, I did the same for you. That's why we don't deserve that. We were living on quicksand, and if this story is nightmarish, it's still ours. What I mean is... Do you understand what I mean? It wouldn't mean much for me to kill you. When you love someone it's easier to do it. These are the rules of our game. Now that I think about it, they should throw us together somewhere. Yes, bury us somewhere. Oh, that can't be done. It can't. I have things to do. Then, I'm waiting for you as well. Long ago we agreed... ...that out world is deserted and full of traps. And we turned that into a game. "I ache", "I'm hurt", "I fear". It's you who runs the game. That's the important thing. First I heard her heels on the corridor. And then there was that tremendous smell of her perfume. Her heels always got on my nerves. But they kept me company, yes... I think... like... If, some moment... See You In Hell, My Darling You left the door open, and a storm is coming. And, from what I remember, you always come with the storm. Are you alone? Candy? Cinnamon candy? Cinnamon candy. The music stopped. All music ends sometime. Not this one, it doesn't end that way. You don't remember. I remember very well. Where are you going? I have to switch off the car. I did. You take care of everything. You always wear the same perfume. Jasmine. Jasmine... ...of betrayal. Don't look at me like that. Let go of me now! Why is that? Because I've told you, your heels get on my nerves and you did it on purpose, like back then. I heard you going round the whole house. They always got on my nerves... Alcoholic as always? Or maybe I remember wrong? You remember well. And I see you still smoke my brand. Correct again. Except that it was my brand, from the start. Let's say it's like that. You were certain I would come. You had the ice cubes ready as well. The thing is, how did you find me so easily? It wasn't that hard. You made sure to leave your trail everywhere. And then, I don't know who... ...found who. But that's because you always knew when I needed you. Drink your whisky. Is he gone, or... ...does he still wander outside the house? He's gone. And if someone wanders outside the house, it is not him, for sure. Do you really believe there is someone outside the house? Don't be afraid. I'm here. And no one can scare me by death. Not even the one outside. When he sees me, he'll run. That won't be necessary. Just the smell of your perfume... should knock him out. You used to like it. I lied. It was always intense and... Cheap. Cheap, I remember. Look at us for a while. What do I see? What do you see? Again, after some years... ...women, lonely... ...a bit scared... ...over 30... ...hidden... ..."inside rented hotel rooms". You used to make me happy. You too. But, that was a very long time ago. And why is that gone? Why are you an alcoholic? I thought you would know. My understanding is, we're talking about someone who left the door open and the car engine on. You know very well who we're talking about. Once, I committed suicide with a handfull of pink pills. After that, several times with a knife. Then with... a g-gun... Then I was killed in a car accident. You shouldn't complain after all. Because every time you died you used to take someone with you. Nice. I don't; although of course I was expecting of a better meeting. Let's see... We haven't met since before the... Since that joke with the smalI van, on your wedding day. Ah, yes. But I mean formally. Before your father's funeral. You, who always liked, since young, going to a whole lot of funerals. We had agreed to lose contact for a while. But he loved you. I loved him too. I sent a wreath, what more? And then, how do you know I had never come from a distance... staring at you... No way. I would have smelt your terrific perfume. I say we start. First you have to tell me why he left. Why don't you ask why I left? How did you make love? Show me. I don't remember. But I do. You were like this. Now show me how you made love. I don't know. I don't remember well. You told him you loved him. I never said anything like that. Say it. I wanna hear it. "I love you". Say it. I love you. Not like that, I'm gonna puke. I love you. Don't go. I love you too. That's what he said to you. And then what happened? You made love. Show me. Naked. Naked? And why did he leave? I don't know. We only made love. I knew she needed me more than I needed her, and I stayed by her side. But I think she loved me. That's why she loved me. Our rules were made like this, since we were kids. Eventually we started growing up together but... we didn't go very far. Well, if you remember, it was me who started smoking that brand. Then you liked the package a lot. There is a someone in the pool. I know. It's just that he's not just "someone". He's dead and he has a name. Don't tell me you forgot his name? How long has he been here? I don't remember. What do you mean you don't remember? "I don't remember". What happened here? I don't remember. But I don't think it's my fault. Then? He wanted to go. Then how? Who... who killed him? Don't ask me. I don't know anything. Right. And I lost my cardigan in the water, too. I puked as well, in case you're concerned. We have to put him somewhere. We can't leave him like that. Yes, bury him somewhere. The garden is huge. For sure. There's room for all of us in this garden. What are you doing? I'm putting on my shoes. But, they're all wet. I know, but I'm cold. I think I'm in deep trouble. But, better off dead than poor. Let that go, I'm not in the mood. Better off dead than poor. Ok, dead people don't come back. Ugly way to die. Better off dead than poor. We said that. Terror was a gemini. You always beat me in that game. When did that happen? What? Ah, yes. I don't know. The only thing I remember is that... I found him up on the veranda. Then I dragged him down the stairs... and I leaned him... ...I put him... No... ...I threw him in the water... ...yes, we should bury him. Oh, we can't bury him. Someone's wandering around here. if we leave him in the pool the one that' s wandering will be scared and go away. I think he should stay here. Do you see how much he's changed? Hasn't he changed? He has changed. I couldn't see him. Has he changed? Yes, he's changed. He has become better looking than then. Will you come with me? Where? The heat sticks on me. ...to swim for a while and then give you something for your stomach. I can't. I'm cold. We must drag him out of here. It should rain again anytime soon. I don't care. Let him get up and go where he wishes... ...but I don't think he will. Now that you're here, he prefers to be wet and cold. Either way, we have to put him somewhere. And then, be by ourselves. He wouldn't be too happy to hear you talk like that about him. How does that matter now? What matters, is that the three money bags are split in two now. What matters, is that they can be split in one as well. We'll stuff him with rocks and he'll go straight to the bottom. You push, because his legs bend. I pull and you're sitting there. Well, come on little strawberry. Ehm... the sea is that way, little strawberry. What did you call me? What did I call you? What did you call me just now? What did I call you just now? I called you 'little strawberry'. I told you to never call me like that again. I don't think you chose the right time to quarrel. Get his leg. I told you to never call me 'little strawberry' again and you did it on purpose. Good, I will not call you again... little strawberry. Now, pull. I do. But you always enjoyed insulting me. You always fire up. Come on. What's wrong with 'little strawberry'? I told you to never call me that again. I didn't say that for you. I just said it. Little strawberry. Watch it! What, what? The way you drag him, his head will crack. No more. Come on, a few more metres. Get up! What happened? His shoe came off. Let that go, he doesn't need it. There's no shoelace. I go for the boat. Put that out! Why? Because someone might see us. Great, and what do we do now? What we planned... ...to the bottom. To the bottom? Without rocks? You didn't bring any rocks? How could I bring any rocks? We came together. You should have brought rocks. You were always like that- careless and light-headed. What are you doing there? I'm trying... to get on. You wear no panties. I never wear panties... now, pull. What kind of game is that? Come on... Let me go... "I write to you without an address." "Here, thinking of you." "I engrave the outline of your eyes onto the waters of the lake." "I asked from the rains to fall near me," "but all that falls is a dry autumn and i'm lonely." "Boredom, wrinkles on the face." "You had fog when I met you." Who had fog? I don't understand. It doesn't matter. "Now, here, I've become one small fairy tale with no ending." "The streets of my gray city are all blind alleys and they end in closed horizons." "The broken words of..." "...the broken words of your farewell..." "...fill my hours." "Words and gestures only." "Small, weak, deviant little hands." ...small, weak, deviant... - Ah, yes! "Small, weak, deviant little hands..." "...rip my thought apart." "My voice changes..." -changes changes changes changes- "...with time." "I stare at you for a long time." "Do you see me?" Face-down in the pool water... ...a little hard for him to see you. I will be staring at you wrapped in heavy fishing net, full of rocks, tied up with thick rope. I will throw you at the sea, straight to the bottom. I have in mind something like that... After all, three money bags split in one is more than split in three. Next time, maybe you'll win. Do you remember that song? Yes. I remember it, too. He should remember it as well. I don't think he remembers anything anymore. We have trouble. What do you want here? Do you understand what I'm saying? How did you get here? Tie me up better next time, come. You... Me, what? Ah, yes. On the table. Get back on your little table, right now. He... ...is no longer in the pool. No longer, what? What are you doing here? What do you mean? You were tied on the table How did you untie yourself? Why do you care? I'm trying to tell you he is no longer in the pool. What isn't? Him. He is no longer in the pool. When did that happen? I don't know. I went to the veranda to get my cigarettes and the pool was empty. Did they empty the pool as well? There is no corpse. Someone took him. What's wrong? Alright now, tell me where you took him. To the sea? My stomach hurts. I'm not feeling... ...well. You 're not well, I know. Tell me where you put him and I'll give you medicine. The days that had a taste of cinnamon candy... ...are over. Here, take this and you will calm down. Someone wants... Let go of my hand. Someone wants to kill me. Yeah, someone wants to kill you to get your share. It's your stomach, little strawberry. Don't call me that. Ok, I won't call you like that again. But you've cleared a bottle of whisky. Who is trying to kill you? I'm not well. Take this to get well and then we'll go see him. What is that? I don't want it. Come on, or I'll cram it in. I will throw it up, I don't want it. If you throw it up, I will give you another. What's that? Poison? It's medicine. What do you think it is? Ok, it's poison, now take it. Why do you play this game on me? What did you do with him? I did nothing with him. Come. I can't swallow it. Chew it, it doesn't taste so bad. And if you tell me what you did with him, I'll tell where the money is hidden. I don't want anything. Now, open your mouth. Come on, be a good girl and open it. Come now, some more, more. Nice. That's it. You're making fun of me. You don't want to get well. I'm scared. (look) Chew it well and swallow it. I'm scared. What's that? Poison. Chew it. It doesn't taste bad. I'll be back soon. Let me go. You know that... I know. Not that. Your glasses are broken. I know. I wear them out of habit. Down at the door, you scared me. You scared me, too. Why don't we quit joking around? I saw you in the pool playing dead. What have you arranged with my girl friend? With my good friend? To drive me crazy. If it's about the money, I don't care, she can have it. But I saw you, in the pool and at the garden door after that. I saw you, too. Are you ok? My stomach hurts a little and I throw up a lot. You, are you ok? I'm a bit cold. Do you know that we almost threw you to the sea? But we didn't do very well and, now we're back together. What happened here? Did she know? She knew. And she wanted to come with us as well. And what happened? What happened to you? I don't remember. Where is she now? I don't know. I left the house. I want you to take care of her. Do you still love her? What is there? Where? Where you are. I don't know where I am. I told you, I don't remember much. Me? And that old song. Did you put that on? I was trying to warn you. What is it here? Where? I've come here before. Why did you want to warn me? That I didn't make it and to take care. How can I take care of me and her as well? We didn't make it. She will exterminate us both and then she'll be free to get away with the money. That's what's on her mind. She loves you. Anyway, I wouldn't want you to harm her. The telephone in the house is off. Off? Off, and it wasn't me who did it. And the garden door is closed, I can't get through. Someone is on guard. There it goes again. She's calling someone. It's you she wants. When will I see you? Where will you be? I'll find you. Is there anything you need? What should I get you? What do you want me to get you? Cigarettes. Cigarettes... Many cigarettes. Ok, many cigarettes. Don't! Let me go! You're hurting me! Let me go... Listen... Listen to me! She knows we're together. She gives me bad pills. Let me go. I'm ready. Where are we going? To my father's grave. To your father's grave. And what are we gonna do at your father's grave? We 'll open it and make some room for the other one. We 'll open it and make some... What are you talking about? Why your father's grave? It is nearby. It is nearby, very well. I'm perfect for night walks in graveyards. Don't tell me you're scared. We used to do that all the time. And stop repeating everything I tell you. That was a long time ago. And we weren't opening graves. We were only stealing wreaths and flowers. And why the hell is your father's grave nearby? I made him a grave and had him moved here to keep him close to me. Don't worry, it's a two-minute walk from here, at the end of the estate. Come. Where are you taking me? I'm tired. This is crazy, totally crazy. And ridiculous at that. Be careful, because... in front of us now... there is a small basin. Is there water in it? Why? Just to know, whether we'll find a dead body in there as well. Ah no, only scorpions and water snakes. Scorpions and water snakes. This is ridiculous. Foot bridge. You didn't love my father. I loved him very much. Then, why is going to his grave ridiculous? Because it's the dead of the night and we have to go through scorpions and water snakes. Your father is not in that grave, is he? You can go back if you want. Ok, so we're going to the grave. All this talk is silly. Looks like I'm drunk. Watch for the tomatoes. I think I've buried him in the tomatoes. Don't worry. There is nothing she can do to me. I want to see you later. Yes, I buried him in the tomatoes. Last year the earwig burned them all. But this year everything will go just fine. I have to go. Oops, we missed the grave. Watch your step. Ok -I'll see you later. Cigarettes? Ahh, with scorpions and water snakes... I can't see a thing. Where exactly is it? I don't know, I don't remember. I've never come here at night. And how the hell are we going to find him into the night? The graves shine bright at night. The bones of the dead... they have phosphor. - And that shines through the graves. - Whatever. I think we lost the grave. Father... Where are you? Father, I want you to know that... if something happens to me... my friend will have done it. Me too. If something happens to me my friend will have done it. I have a friend with me. Grave! We found it. Hello, father! My friend here says - do you remember the one we called 'little strawberry'? So she says, that it isn't hard to talk to a dead guy. And that you can make love to him as well. I'm sorry. But my friend makes me laugh. We want... We want some space. You have to move a bit aside, because we have to put someone else there with you as well. You don't mind, do you? No. (Οk!) Βecause that guy wanders here and there and makes pranks. Αnd now he may be hidden here somewhere watching us - Booooh! He walks every room and drips his wet everywhere. I know him well. You don't mind, do you? Will you make room for him? Ok - he'll make room for him. And don't let them kill me. What are you talking about? Quiet, I'm talking with my father now. We thought about dropping him into the sea, but that was a bit dangerous. And then she went secretly and took him out of the pool. And she says she made love to him as well. She always made love to him. I'm leaving. You remember my father. I remember him very well. There's nothing here. I'm leaving. But there is, sweetie, there is... A suitcase that small with three really big shares. Two. Two, now. I treat you bad, but you'll come with me. I will come with you, but you are a scum, know that. Why did you call me that? You were like that since you were a little girl. A small, vicious scum and you never loved me. Making fun of me all the time, 'little strawberry' and all. I asked you not to, but there, you said it again, to your father. It's not my fault that you used strawberry flavoured condoms. Did you have to tell everyone? I didn't say anything. The whole school knew. Some of your lovers betrayed you. The money... ...Whom you slept with. Well, that's how we did then, that's how we do now as well. Give me back my watch. Do you know I loved you very much back then? Yeah, when everyone else left, you were coming to me for comfort. Give me my watch. - No. - I want my watch. One watch, many watches. Isn't that what you came for? Give it to me! Better off dead than poor. With a hole in the head. I want my watch. You never know with women. Here's your watch. You have to eat something. I can't, I throw it all up. If I leave you alone, he will come. And what's there for you to gain? If you're not lying to me I will gain a trap. You can't do anything to him anymore. But he told you he loves me. What did you give to me? You gave something to me. I gave nothing to you. You are scared and worn out. You've always been sickly. With every occasion you were down and I would choke you with sugar to come around, remember? What did he say to you? Elsa... I'm cold. I'm cold and scared. You have to let me go. What did you call me? Elsa. How long is it since you last called me that? Let me take you to lie down. Step on my feet. Come on, step on my feet. How? Come on, you know how. Don't you remember? Vera! Don't you remember? I feel dizzy. If you put that old song on... ...he comes. How do you know? When he wants something, he plays the old song. If you put it on, maybe he'll come. To save you? No. To make love to you. Cigarettes? They're wet. Would you light one for me as well? There are just a few. Five. There are just five. I'll get you more. She told me you wanted cigarettes. And that you told her something else as well. Something about me. About the two of us. What is it here? What do you mean, "what is it here"? I've been here before. Here? Of course you've been here before. This is the west veranda. Where we used to sit and watch the sun as it went. The sunset... You came here because you heard the song? Don't, don't... Oh, sorry! I should have tried harder. I miss you a lot. I don't know why... I don't want to, but with everyone I ever loved I 've always been very mean. Very mean. My eye. I remember that. You used to say that often. You like teasing me, even now. You are wet, aren't you cold like that? I'm like that for a long time now. What's wrong with your hand? Where? It's just a smudge, from the fridge. Give it to me. No. Just a look. What are you doing there? Are you marrying me again? Look what I've got here. If I get you many cigarettes, will you marry me again? Many cigarettes. Nice. This time I'll try harder. But, you know something? You have to help me. We have to throw her to the sea, she's very ill. Where is she? She's in the c... Where is she? Why do you care? I told you, I've taken care of everything. If there is many people to the beach... we'll take her to my father's grave. The only thing is, she's a bit heavy. I can't do it on my own. On my own. Where are you going now? I'd say she looks awful. She ate something that hurt her stomach and she's drunk too. She's cleared two bottles of whisky and she pukes. Where are you going? She's the other way around. Besides, if we let her, she'll tell on us and we'll get caught. And they'll set us apart. I won't tell a thing, but she remembers you come with the song, and she'll set you a trap. You're not going anywhere. Alright. Let's go see. Aah, little strawberry. Don't drink that. It's poisoned. I know. She does that. She broke my watch. The other one is still inside. You can leave with her, if you want. I don't want you to put me in the water again. But you know we can't be apart. If I put you there, I'll come with you. You said you love me, and that you'll marry me again. Isn't that what you told her? And that you want many cigarettes. I know everything, you see? I saw you making love the day of our wedding. You made love. Yes, but he stayed with you. He was always with me. Get over with it. From now on, you will do whatever I say. I can't do that. You are half dea... ...dead. You look awful, little strawberry. You will do whatever I say. I won't suffer for you again. He was mine. He was on his own. Since we met each other, on his own. Whenever I left her behind, she was running after me, scared. And she knew that no one loved her like I did. That is why I din't mind her torturing me. She needed me to be mean. And I liked that I was offering her that possibility. But I think she loved me. That's why she loved me. Our rules were made like that, since we were kids. Eventually we started growing up together, but... We didn't go very far. Long ago, we used to steal flowers from the graves. You used to tell me that, at night, the bones of the dead pour phosphor, and they light your way through the graves. Sometimes we would look in the mirror and get confused, and then we would change our voices on purpose to find out who we were again. I knew she was waiting for me. Maybe she would harm me. It meant nothing for her to kill me, but that didn't matter anymore. Games are like this. That's how we played all along. Sure... I could run away and save myself, but... When the ground slips under your feet... the one to catch you, or push you even lower... should be someone you love very much. Only then everything gets some meaning. You're going to him, aren't you? I know you're going to him. And without cigarettes at that. Don't go, Vera. I love you. Me too, Elsa. Me too.
