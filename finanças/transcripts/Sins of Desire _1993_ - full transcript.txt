[♪♪♪] [MONICA MOANING, SCREAMING] [SCOTT LAUGHING, GRUNTING] How are you feeling? I don't know yet. Take it slow. You've got plenty of time. It was a good session, Monica. You just came out of it sooner than I expected. It's hard to focus. Well, that's natural. It'll wear off in just a minute. So come up. You want to, uh-- Wanna tell me about it? Hmm? No. Oh, why not? [SIGHS] It seems so real. Oh, I'm so embarrassed. Embarrassed? Why? [SIGHS] Because. Nothing to be embarrassed about Monica. It was just a dream. Jesus, what happened to my clothes? That stuff you gave me. It's gonna wear off in a minute, Monica. I promise. What did you do to me? Nothing. Monica, listen to me. Nothing really happened. It was just in your mind, all right? If we're gonna make progress, you've gotta trust me. No. Stay away from me. Don't touch me. All right, all right. I won't, all right? What are you afraid of? You! All right, all right. I won't touch you. But I want you to sit down and relax, and everything will be fine. Come on. Monica, stop struggling. Let me go! Monica...no...no. [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] [THUDS, THEN SIGHS] [♪♪♪] JESSICA: Scott. Come on, honey. Let's go home. Are you alone? Of course I'm alone. Everybody's already left. The air conditioner's on the fritz again. What's wrong with you? Nice work. [SIGHS] Little bitch hit her head. Probably be all right. Scott, she's dead. Dead? [SIGHS] Well, she must have come out of it too soon. No, I think you stayed in it too long. I told you, if you don't control yourself, you're gonna blow this whole goddamn operation. All right, all right, so I just screwed up. Yes, you did. Well, now, what are we gonna do? Bring the body to the back. I'll get the car. [♪♪♪] JESSICA: Scott, are you sure this place is safe? SCOTT: Just relax, now. This is the old Monarch Studios. Nobody's been out here in years. Okay? Yes. [GRUNTS] [STRAINING] All right, I got her. You get the shovels. You got 'em? Yeah. Don't drop her. I wanna die. [SIGHS] Pam, don't say that, will ya? What'll I tell Mom? She'll never forgive me, Kay. Would you stop saying that? It's not your fault. Pam, you've gotta report this man to the police. I'll come with you. [SIGHS] I'll take you down there myself. No! No, not the police. Don't tell the police. [BOTH SIGH] Listen, what's the name of that therapist of yours? I-- I'm gonna call him. No! Don't call him, Kay. Don't make me see him. Please. I don't want to talk to Scott. Don't make me talk to Scott. [SOBBING] Please, I don't want to talk to Scott. I don't want to talk to Scott. I won't make you talk to him. Don't worry. Sweetie, I won't make you talk to him, okay? [SHUSHES] Come here. Why don't you try to get some rest, will ya? Come here, give me the book. I won't call him. I promise, I promise. Honey, get some sleep, will ya? Try to rest. Come on. Everything will be okay. I'll be right here. [♪♪♪] Pam? Pammy? Pam? Pam! [TIRES SCREECH] [♪♪♪] You feel a strange sensation. JESSICA: Mmm... It starts moving up your legs. Mm-hm. It's a woman's mouth. Mmm... She seems to know... Tell me more. ...everything about you. She seems to instantly know just what you want and how much. [GASPS] She opens your legs. You can feel the heat of her body. You're so-- Coming close to you. You're so bad. She moves up to your breasts. Taking you. Oh, God, you-- Not a damn thing you can do about it. She owns you now, every inch of you. She spreads your legs wider, and you tingle. The sensation-- The sensation between you, that you've never felt like this before. Scott. She takes you like you've never been taken before, driving you into a frenzy. [GASPING] Making you... Making you... Forcing you over the top. Oh! Do you feel it? Yes. Do you feel it? Yes... Oh. [PHONE RINGING] Let it ring, Scott. Don't answer that phone. Damn it. [CHUCKLES] Yeah? MAN: Scott? Uh-huh? Don't be mad. I'm coming over. Jesus fucking Christ. You'd think people would have something better to do than make prank phone calls-- [♪♪♪] Scott, untie me. Later. Scott! [♪♪♪] [DOORKNOB CREAKS] We're going to miss you, Rachel. What are you doing, Jessica? [SIGHS] Can't I even take a bath? I mean, I'm going to miss you. You know that I like men. So do I. [SCOFFS] Yeah, right. Oh. Sorry, ladies. I was just leaving. Well, well, we, uh, thinking of taking a little dip, are we? You know what I'm doing here. Don't make fun of me, honey. She just rejected me again. [SUCKING TEETH] Tell me something, Jessica dear. Why is it all right for you to molest every little nubile that walks in here but it's not all right for me? Because it's not the same. I don't object to you having affairs with men. Mmm. I do. Listen, Jess, uh, we might have some trouble. [♪♪♪] Mm, I like his car. It matches my nails. SCOTT: Yeah, well, I'm not buying it for you, so forget it. It's gonna be another scorcher today, I can tell. I think it's time for us to find out who this guy is. Why don't you just ask him? [CHUCKLES] Don't think I won't. Not in broad daylight, you dummy. Just relax, my sweet. I'm only gonna scare him a little. Be careful, baby. That's right. I think the doctor can fit you in on Friday. Goodbye. Good morning, Dr. Callister. Good morning, Brandi. Hey, what's the name of that company that was supposed to fix our air conditioning? Uh, Tino something. Well, they didn't get it done, did they? So call them back and tell them to fix it this time so it lasts longer than a couple of days. Right away. Hm, looks like he didn't want to talk to you after all. Well, Jessica, love of my life, I think it's time for us to consider moving on. This clinic is getting too hot. It beats what we were doing, treating head colds and indigestion. As usual, sweetheart, you've missed the point entirely. Jessica, somebody is on to us. Don't you see? So, what do you wanna do? Run away and keep looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life? No, thank you. Look, what I want is-- [PA BEEPS] BRANDI: Excuse me, Dr. Callister. We're calling the new nurse. She should be in sometime this afternoon. Have Rachel show her around and we'll meet her later. You bet. Oh, so Rachel quit now? Oh, Jesus Christ. Let me try to figure out why. At least, none of my girls ever ended up dead. You know what I'm gonna do for you? I'm gonna have a sign printed for this new girl, and I'm gonna put it around her neck. It's gonna say, "Hands off, Jessica." We worked too hard to get what we have now, we're not gonna blow it here. Remember, hands off, Jessica. No promises until I get to see what she looks like. [♪♪♪] [TIRES SCREECH, THEN THUD] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Rache, hi. No, no, I'm okay. This afternoon? Sure. Sure, I can start then. Yeah, okay. I'll see you then. Bye. [SIGHS] [BUTTONS ON KEYPAD BEEPING] [LINE RINGING] OFFICER: Police department. Homicide division. Ah, yes. Is, um, Lieutenant Dolenz there, please? Al, how can you eat that crap? Do you know what they put in those hot dogs? So you're past the first hurdle. Yep, so far, so good. Don't say it, I know. You still think I'm nuts. Yes I do. But I also know you're very determined. Honey, just keep in mind that you're skating on very thin ice. Yeah, yeah, and officially, your hands are tied. I know. I can't stress that enough, Kay. Honey, if I were having your nightmares, I'd go see a shrink. [SCOFFS] That's a good idea if I had the money. Be careful. I will. I better get going.Thanks. [♪♪♪] I'm sorry that Jessica wasn't here to show you around personally but obviously she's tied up. Oh, that's all right. I'm looking forward to working with you, Miss, umm... Egan. I'm terrible with names. That's all right, Dr. Callister. You got my name right, at least. Excuse me. Brandi, will you please call Rachel. She's in the nurse's lounge. Have her show Miss, uh-- Egan around, yes. Egan. Sure. Well, enjoy your stay. Mmm, thank you. Excuse me for a second. [♪♪♪] So, uh... What the hell are you doing here, Warren? Somebody's been asking questions about me. I'm pretty sure my phone's tapped. Oh, Jesus. So you come here, huh? Don't you understand that's a fool's play? That's exactly what they want you to do. They make it obvious that they're on to you, throw a little panic in you, then follow you back here to us. Unless, of course, you're just imagining this, like last time. I'm telling you, somebody's on to us. All right. Well, just take it easy, Warren. Have a seat. You look like you could use a drink. Hi, Kay. Rache, look at you. You look fantastic. And so do you. Oh, it's good to see you. Come on. Let me show you around the place. You got it. Lead the way. God, listen, I just want to thank you again for helping me get this gig. I really needed it. No kidding. You're a lifesaver. Forget about it, okay? What are friends for? Yeah, okay. Come on. Show me this joint. Well, Warren, old buddy, I thought we had an arrangement that you were going to leave the country. I left the state. I grew my hair, changed my looks. Hell, you try leaving everything you know. All right. All right. Relax, okay? Drink up. So tell me, um, when did you first hear about this? About 10 days ago. Oh, now-- Now, Warren, I want you to think back for a second, all right? Tell me, did you happen to know if anybody flashed a badge? I don't think so. Good, good, good. That means we may not have run out of luck, yet. If it's not the cops, we can handle these guys, right, Warren? And of course, well, if it is the cops, you understand we are all going to fry.

I discovered this my third week here. Oh, don't worry, they can't see us. Oh, my God. What is this? Oh, it's a miracle. We're about to see Mr. Burt O'Conner cured of his impotency. With a little help from Sandy and Clarise, of course. Oh, and of course, the real boss of the place, Jessica Callister. She's the one with her clothes on. Yeah, Burt comes here about once a week, and, uh, we keep curing him, but obviously, it doesn't seem to take. KAY: Wait a minute, Rache, are you saying this is some kind of a front for prostitution? RACHEL: Oh no, no, it's legit. I mean, the Callisters aren't quacks, and they have helped some people, but you're right, for the most part, this is just a place to get laid. All right, girls. Burt's playing hard to get today. Pull out the stops. Go for it. [CHUCKLES] Burt, that's not going to do. It's time to come to grips with your problem, now. Are you sure you still want this job? Yeah. It's okay. I can handle it. Any messages, Brandi? Yes. The a.c. guy called. Uh-hm. He can't make it today and wants to know if someone can meet him here tomorrow. Otherwise, he can't make it till Wednesday. Today's Saturday. Yeah. [CLICKS TONGUE] Well, tell him I'll be here. Okay. Dr. Callister. I'd like you to meet your new nurse. This Is Kay Egan. We're happy to have you. It's a pleasure to be here. I hope you find the environment pleasant. Oh, it-- It's just beautiful. Well, we'll see you on Monday, then. Sure. Good night. Good night. Goodbye, Dr. Callister. Looks like I won't be needing these anymore. Oh, yeah. Brandi, do me one favor. Sure. Look out for Kay for me. She'll be fine. [SIGHS] Get outta here. Yeah, right. Hey, listen, thanks for getting me the job, huh. No problem. Call me and we'll have lunch sometime. Sure. Hey, this time it's on me. Sounds good.Okay. Scott, darling, do you have five minutes for me? WARREN: Jessica. Looking butch as always. Knock it off, Warren. What's he doing here? Well it seems, my dear, that our little red sports car may have been busier than we thought. Sports car? Somebody been following you too? Looks like. [♪♪♪] [ENGINE STARTS] [ENGINE STARTS] Can I help you? Uh, yeah, you got a minute? I'd like to ask a few questions. I'm a private investigator. You wouldn't happen to have any ID, would you? Barry Mitchum. Height, 6'4", weight... Mmm...200. Eyes, green. Hair, black. Birthdate, 10-15-57. Getting up there, huh? I'm investigating the disappearance of a Monica Waldman. Why are you coming to me? I don't know who she is. Well, you work at the Callister Clinic, don't you? Monica Waldman used to be a patient there. Umm, listen. Why don't you come on inside. Can I get you a beer? Yeah, sure. Well, why don't you start from the top? About a year ago, a man named Warren Robillard buys a million dollar accident policy from the No Risk Insurance Company, naming the Callisters as sole beneficiaries. Ten days after the policy goes into effect, Robillard gets hit by a fast-moving train, sending his body parts into four different directions. Basically, all they found was an ear, three toes, and half his ass. How'd they know it was Robillard? What, did he have his name tattooed on his buttocks? [CHUCKLES] No. That's the point. There was no hard evidence that it was Robillard. They found a bag with his personal effects on the station platform, and he was reportedly missing from work and home. So? What's the problem then? Well, there was no problem until about four months ago when, uh, a man curiously resembling Warren Robillard shows up in Vegas playing the tables, looking remarkably well for a corpse. Unfortunately, No Risk had already paid out the claim, and you can imagine the jubilation on their faces when they found out they'd been swindled out of a cool million. Mm. So, um, how does Monica fit into all this? I mean, what was she doing posing as a patient at the Callister's clinic? [SIGHS] When three people commit fraud and murder, they're bound together for life. Like it or not, sooner or later they come together. That's what Monica and I were counting on. When I was trying to track down Robillard, Monica was in town getting therapy sessions from Callister, hoping that Robillard would come to the clinic. Hmm. Well, did he? Did she run into him? No. But she did find out that the Callisters were involved in some pretty strange shit. She suspected them of drugging and molesting some of the patients. Well, why didn't she go to the police? Oh, she wanted to, but she needed some proof. She told me that she was gonna tape her next therapy session. That was the last time I spoke with her. So, um... What do you want from me? How can I help? I gotta find Monica's tape. You work at the clinic. I want you to help me find it. It's the only way I can find out what happened. [EXHALES] Listen. I'm really sorry about what happened to your partner, I mean it, I really am, but look, I just got this job. I can't afford to get fired. I need the money. Okay. Okay, but if you change your mind, I'll be staying at the Valley Hotel on Langdon. Give me a call. Even if you don't change your mind, give me a call. I'll see myself out. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] JESSICA: How many times have we gone through this? I told you not to come here. I parked three blocks from here, just to play it safe. If you'd played it safe, you wouldn't've come in the first place. [PHONE RINGS] I'll get it. Hello. OPERATOR: This is the service. We have a call from Kay Egan. JESSICA: Put it through. Hi Kay, this is Jessica. Uh, Dr. Callister. Uh, hi, um... I hope I'm not calling too late. No, it's okay. What's the matter? The weirdest thing happened to me today. Um, when I was leaving the clinic, I noticed this red car following me home, and, um, when I got home, this guy jumps out and starts asking me all these questions about a Monica Walding or Waldman, some friend of his. He said she was a patient at your clinic. What did you tell him? What could I tell him? I just started there. The whole thing was just very weird. How did you leave it? Well, I told him I couldn't help him, and, um, that was-- Oh, he did give me his card. [MOUTHING WORDS] He said I should call him if I had a change of heart. I hope I did the right thing. Yes, you did fine, honey. Calm down. But just to be on the safe side, why don't you give me his name and address, and I'll have my friend at the precinct check him out. Yeah, um, his name is, uh, Barry Mitchum. He's staying at the Valley Motel, 11869 Langdon Boulevard. Um, that's about all, but I-- Please forgive me again if I disturbed you, okay? We'll take care of it. Bye. Well, it looks like this new girl's gonna work out just fine, but I'm afraid we have a little problem. But it looks like we have a solution. You don't expect me to-- Why not? [STUTTERS] Why-- I couldn't-- I mean, I can't kill anyone. Oh, Warren. Sure you can. It's real simple. All you gotta do is just point it and pull the trigger. No. You don't understand. It's violent. Shut up. You can and you will. See what it's like to get your hands dirty for a change. I have never even had a gun before. What if I miss? [CHUCKLES] Why, Warren, if that's all that's bothering you... Here. Oh, now, that looks good on you. You got us into this mess, and you're gonna get us out of it. Oh, please. Please-- It's all right. It's okay. Please don't make me do this. [♪♪♪] Relax, Warren, you're gonna do just fine. Uh, make sure nobody sees you. I can't do this. You should have thrown me in front of that train instead of that fucking derelict. Okay, so if time could go backwards, your head would be flying off your shoulders as we speak. You owe us. Don't fuck it up. [ENGINE STARTS] [FLOOR CREAKS] [CAT YOWLS] [GASPS] [SIGHS IN RELIEF] [CAT MEOWS] [DOORKNOBS RATTLE] [GUNSHOTS, YELLING, AND A BUGLE PLAYING INDISTINCTLY ON TV] It's not working right now. Oh. Thanks.

No, not my wife. [♪♪♪] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [COCKING GUN] [RATTLING] [BARRY YELPS] [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] [MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY] [COUGHS] Did you kill him, Warren? [GASPING] Warren, did you kill him?

I'm talking about sending Robillard and the Callisters after me. That is a lie. I didn't send anyone after you. You don't know the difference between truth and lies! Why'd you do it, Kay? Why'd you set me up? Why are you protecting them? What do they have on you? [SOBBING] They killed my sister! Let go of me! What do you know? They killed my sister. Oh, Jesus, babe. [THUNDER CRASHES] Sorry. I didn't-- I didn't know. So, um, she was in love with this guy who dropped her. She would never let any other guy come near her. And I don't know how she heard about it. [THUNDER CRASHES] Maybe a friend, or she read about it in a magazine. Before I knew it, she was going to the Callisters' sex therapy clinic. Oh, God, what did they do to her? Nothing. Nothing, at first. She was fine. She was even getting better. So, what happened? She was, you know, hysterical. She said she was buried under-- She wouldn't tell me who did it, but I know who did it. And that was the day she killed herself. [THUNDER CRASHES] Jesus. So you used me... to keep the Callisters busy while you went to the clinic to look for the file? I didn't mean for you to get hurt. [SCOFFS] Really, I'm not kidding. [SIGHS] I didn't. I think that I've overstayed my welcome here. I'd better go. Come on. Please, stay here, would you? I'm guilty enough.

Hey, listen, are you sure Monica didn't tell you where she put that tape? Hey, don't worry about Monica. Wherever she put it, it's very well hidden. But I scoured that room from top to bottom, and I couldn't find anything. Well, maybe they found it already. Okay, okay, say they found it. We still gotta look for it. Look, if you don't find Robillard, that tape is all we got to nail those bastards with. Yeah, if it still exists. Barry, you are such a defeatist. It has to exist. It must.

I have to go meet that a.c. repairman. Remember? Oh, yeah. Well, better you than me, dear. You owe me for this, buster. [CHUCKLES] Okay if I take you to dinner? Will that placate you?

Oh. Ah. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Here we go. Um... Here we go. Are we in luck. Doesn't that come in pill form? Yeah. But it takes 48 hours. You ain't got that long. Oh, I got plenty of time. Uh, I hate needles. [CHUCKLES] Barry, are you gonna be a baby about this? Yes. Okay, baby. What's it gonna be? Arm or butt? Butt works faster. Isn't-- Isn't there a third choice? You know, I think there is a third choice. So let's, uh... [STAMMERS] I'm-- Wait a minute. Now that I think about it, the butt is-is good. It-- The butt sounds-- Okay. Okay. Okay. Um... I'll turn around. [INHALES, SIGHS] Oh, very nice. Okay, take a deep breath. [EXHALES, GASPS] That's it. Do I give great needle or what? [♪♪♪] Man, oh, man, what a week this has been. I swear to God, I've never had so many units break down on me at the same time. Hi, Larry Langtry at your service. [SNEEZES] [GROANS] Man, there is nothing worse than a summer cold, I tell ya. It's incredible, the amount of gunk the human body can produce, huh. So, uh, what do you guys do around here? [SNEEZES] My brother Tom's had the same thing for the last three weeks. That's another reason the work's backing up on us. [BEEPS] How long do you think this will take? Well, it depends. I-- Hold on. [SNEEZES] [GROANS] Sick of this doggone cold. Won't let me go! It must be very annoying. You better believe it. So I'll take a look at the unit. Soon as I know, you'll know. I appreciate that. It's the end of the stairwell. [LARRY SNEEZES] If this isn't any better by tomorrow, I don't care what you say, you're going to a doctor. You know, I'm not used to being taken care of like this. Uh, I'm not sure, but I think I might like it. Did you hear me? Yeah, I heard you. [GRUNTS] Do you hear me? Loud and clear. Listen, I'm gonna go and check out some of the other rooms. Hey, not too tight this time, okay? Okay. I'll catch up with you in a minute. Mm-hm. [♪♪♪] Oh, God. Kay? Mrs. Callister. Ah, you startled me. What are you doing here? [STAMMERS] Um, well, uh, I only was here a half a day yesterday and-- And I thought maybe I'd come by today and sort of familiarize myself with the place. Well, I appreciate your enthusiasm. Thank you. Did Rachel tell you that one of your jobs was to check the inventory in the dispensary? [GASPS] No. But I'm sure I can handle it. I made it real easy. Let me show you. Before we-- Before we do, um, I thought, maybe, you could explain this, um, computer format to me. I don't-- I don't think I recognize it. These are very standard. By the way, have you heard from that guy again who was asking you those questions? That guy? Uh... Oh, no. No, no, I haven't seen him. Good. Oh, I get it. Yeah. I do recognize it. [SIGHS] Real simple. I'll show you the dispensary. Okay. It's very important that you keep the supplies well-stocked at all times. Um... Yeah, whatever you say. [COUGHS] Mrs. Callister? Oh, God. I'll be back in a second. [SIGHS] God. Barry? Barry? You double-crosser. What the hell is going on? Oh, God. We gotta hurry. She's gonna be back any minute. Listen. You look around while I keep her occupied, okay? [♪♪♪] Come on. Right down that hall, Dr. Callister's therapy room is the third door on the right. Go on, hurry up. No, the right. The right. [SNEEZES] Mrs. Callister? So can you fix it? [SNEEZES] Lady, you got big problems down there. There's freon leaking all over the place. You better come take a look. [SIGHS] [♪♪♪] [COUGHS] I'm gonna have to send to Dubuque for a new stem rod. Probably can't get the part till Monday. Well, you do whatever you have to do. Just send us the bill. You can leave out the back door. Oh, right. Thank you. [MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY, SNIFFS] [♪♪♪] Damn it. Aw, f-- [GASPS] [GROANS] Hello. Oh, did they get it fixed? Oh, the guy's working on it. You had something you wanted to show me? Yeah, I certainly did. The purpose of these rooms is to create an atmosphere that encourages our patients to overcome their individual inhibitions. Mmm. How many rooms are there? There are five rooms. Each room is specifically designed to remedy even the most outlandish sexual problems. I had no idea there was such diversity. Amazing, isn't it? Mmm. Did Rachel tell you what kind of work we do at this clinic? [STAMMERING] No, but she did say she enjoyed working here a lot, and that you helped a lot of people. Well, I guess I'll see you on Monday then, huh? Uh, uh, say, tell me, um, [NORMALLY] who does the decorating for these rooms, anyway? We have a great team from Newark that does it. [CLICKS] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Just relax. You'll enjoy this. Women know what women want. [MOANING] Kay. [GASPS] You scared the shit outta me! What the hell were you doing in there? [SIGHS] Don't ask. You realize how uncomfortable it's been back here? You wanna talk about uncomfortable? Get down, will ya? [ENGINE STARTS] [♪♪♪] You okay? I'm fine. Hell, I would've rather them shot me in the other leg than let that happen. Would you quit worrying about it? I'm gonna be fine. All I need is a long, hot shower. Very long. Very hot. Disgusting. SCOTT: Monica, you've got to trust me. MONICA: No. Stay away from me. Don't touch me. SCOTT: All right. All right. I won't. All right. What are you afraid of? MONICA: You. SCOTT: All right. I won't touch you. But I want you to sit down and relax, all right? and everything will be fine. [CLICKS] That's it? That's all she wrote? Yep. [SCOFFS] But that doesn't prove anything. That doesn't prove they killed Monica. No, but it proves they were drugging and molesting their patients. That ought to be enough to get your sister's case going. Barry. [SIGHS] Listen, I'm not letting you walk out of here empty-handed. There's gotta be something-- There's gotta be something we can get on them. Not without a body. [SIGHS] Wait a minute. I got an idea. [♪♪♪] Jess, I've been having some serious thoughts about what we should do next. And what's that, darling? Televangelism. I'm gonna need more makeup for that. [SIGHS] No, I'm serious. Consider the possibilities. You as a born-again virgin. The mind boggles at the concept. And even if we fall into our old bad habits, there's nothing wrong with a good old-fashioned sex scandal to keep the flock coming in. Darling, I don't quite think that's gonna do it. Besides, it's just a little bit too late to jump on that bandwagon. I was toying with the idea of politics. Senator Callister. [PHONE RINGING] I like it. And her husband. Right. Hello. Kay. [SIGHS] I don't know any Monica Waldman. Kay, this man is obviously deranged. I suggest you stay away from him. You're welcome to stay with us, honey. Thank you. Bye. What's up? Mr. Binoculars just busted into Kay's apartment, apparently drunk out of his skull. He told her he'd found Monica's body. Shit. He said if we don't meet him on the corner of Brand and Dexter within the hour, he's calling the police. Wait, wait, wait a minute. Kay told you this? How do you know you can trust her, Jessica? Come on, they may be in this together for all you know. There's no reason why I shouldn't trust her. I trust her. All right. All right, just calm down. We still gotta figure out what to do with this guy. First, we should find out if he really does know where the body is. And then we should take care of him once and for all. You're on. [MAN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO] So this lady goes to the hospital to give blood. She's getting on the elevator. This guy she knows is getting off the elevator. He says, "Whatcha doing?" She says, "I'm going downstairs to give blood." He says, "How much they give you for that? She says, "$25 a quart." She says, "What about you?" He says, "I just came from upstairs and donated some sperm." She says, "Oh, how much they give you for that?" He says, "$250." A month later, they run into each other in the hospital. He's getting off the elevator, she's getting on. Says to her, "You going downstairs to give blood?" She goes: [GRUNTS] Pfft! [BOTH CHUCKLING] You pig. Oh, God. God, who writes your material? DISPATCHER [OVER RADIO]: Sergeant Dolenz, Sergeant Dolenz. This is dispatch. Uh, what's your situation? Uh, we're status quo. They're a no show. Kay, do you think they bought your story? Oh, God. Would you take it easy? They bought it. They bought it. They're coming. DOLENZ: This is crazy. We've got enough evidence to bring 'em in. Yeah, maybe we do. But what are you gonna do? Freeze Barry out? There they are. [♪♪♪] [ENGINE STARTING] [ENGINE STARTING] [♪♪♪] [SIREN BLARES] What the fuck's going on? Looks like a fuckin' cop car to me. Damn it. It's a fucking bust. Hello. SCOTT: Evening. Good evening, folks. What's going on, Kay? What are you trying to pull? Um, I think I'll let Detective Dolenz explain that. DOLENZ: Mr. and Mrs. Callister, I don't believe you've had the pleasure of meeting Barry Mitchum. He's doing investigative work for the No Risk Insurance Company. Seems his partner, Monica Waldman, has disappeared. And we have reason to believe that you know her whereabouts. No. Ahem. We already had this discussion with Miss Egan here. And she knows we never heard of this person. Yeah, well, um, there seems to be a little discrepancy in your story. You see, we happen to have one of those little therapy sessions of yours and Monica right here in this cute little tape recorder. Ha, ha. Funny, isn't it? You're bluffing, Kay. You got nothing on that tape and you know it. We'll be happy to play it for you on the way to the station, but first, would you put your hands up where I can see them? What are you trying to do, Kay? I thought I could trust you. Yeah, you thought you could trust me. Just like my sister thought she could trust you, huh? Your sister? What sister? Pamela Hansen. You remember Pamela Hansen, don't you, doctor? You know, I don't know what kind of line of bullshit this sister of yours is playing on you, but, uh, I don't know her. I mean, I never touched the little bitch. You liar. [SCOTT MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY] [GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] Ow! [DISTORTED] Fuck her guy. Come on. [SCOTT GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [GROANING, SCREAMING] You know your big problem, pal? You were in the wrong place at the wrong time. [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING] [YELPS] [JESSICA SCREAMS] [YELLS] Jess? You fucking bitch! You die now! [PANTING] [♪♪♪] Kay. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [CHUCKLES] You fucked up! No getting out of here. So now you're mine. [♪♪♪] Kay? I, uh, got a confession to make. That, uh, kid sister? Yeah, I remember her, all right. Oh, yeah, she was a frigid little bitch with a great body. When I got ahold of her... everything changed. I mean, she just couldn't get enough. Know what I mean? Just an insatiable... little... bitch. Kay. Come on! [ENGINE HUMMING] [ENGINE REVVING] Come on. Come on!
