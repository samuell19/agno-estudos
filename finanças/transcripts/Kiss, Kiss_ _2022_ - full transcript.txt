You're gonna kill us! - [horn honks] - [man] Move it! - [tires screech] [man] What if HQ decides to move me to New York? I want to go to California! - You've just gotta grin and bear it. - Los Angeles! At the office in flip-flops. - Straight from the beach. - [tires screech] Whoa! Whoa! Slow down! We still have an hour. - [tires screeching] - [horns honking] [surf music continues] KISS, KISS! [woman] You see? We're 45 minutes early. This will be the biggest deal in company history. If you manage to close it. [man] If? [woman] Well, the guys from Japan still need to sign it. [man] It's just a formality. Once they sign it, I'll be the king of the world. You remember my parents are coming this weekend? Well, that's perfect. I'll go party downtown with the boys and stay out of your hair then. No, they want to meet you. - What am I gonna say to them? - What do you mean? "It's very nice to meet you. I'm the one banging your daughter." Madzia, we've got a good thing going. The sex is great and all... [chuckles] But we never promised each other anything more. [inhales deeply] Yeah. - Yeah. That's what... - Oh, hey, Madzia. - Hey. - [Madzia] Hi. - Welcome, welcome. - [man] Hi. So, is that your big multi-million-dollar idea? You're really climbing the ladder, huh, man? They're gonna make you global manager in no time. - I'm not counting my chickens just yet. - [Madzia] Tomek! When they appoint you Head of Operations, you won't forget your friends, will you? Tomek! Chill. Everything's under control. I forgot my phone. I'll be right back. [footsteps receding] [phone ringing] I'm coming. I'm coming. [laughing softly] I can't wait as well. - [rock music plays] - [woman giggling] Yeah. Wait, but... [gasps] - I'll call you later, okay? - [chuckles] - Oh, Jesus Christ! - Oh no, my oranges! - I'm terribly sorry. - The best local ones. I put them in some Jell-O mix, and it's delicious. - Do you ever use Jell-O? - Of course. All the time. - Excuse me. - [woman 2] Sure. No problem. What? Oh my God, Kasia, they're here. - The Japanese? - Yeah. Over a half hour ahead of time? What are you doing? Find Tomek already? I'll call him. [door alarm beeps] - [doors hiss and close] - [sighs] [phone ringing] [ringing stops] [speaking Japanese] [speaking Japanese] Um... [speaking Japanese] Ah! [speaking Japanese] - [chuckles and repeats phrase] - Ah. [repeats phrase] We're honored to meet you. Thank you for the invitation. - [laughing uneasily] - [chuckles] - [Madzia chuckles softly] - [whimsical music playing] Beautiful day. It's just started. [laughing] Well, I already know it'll be beautiful. Hmm, are you a psychic? Of course. Your hand. Come on, I'll tell your fortune. This is the most important day in your life. - And it's mine as well. - [woman] Really? Well, yeah. It's no coincidence that we met. It must be destiny. In a few minutes I'm signing the contract of a lifetime. - Congratulations. - And I'll grant you three wishes. - [woman] Oh, so now I have three wishes? - Yeah. How about... disappear the way you appeared. No, come on! You can't just throw away your wishes. [woman] In that case I'd like to... Wait, just let me tell you. You should wish for a hundred more wishes. Mm-hmm, and you'll grant them all? - Yeah. - [woman] In that case... - [inhales] - [door hisses] - [whispering] I wish you had a ticket. - What? [scoffs] And you. Ticket, please. Ticket. [music stops] [sighs] Um... How about... water? [laughs uneasily] Water. [speaking Japanese] Uh, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll check. You can keep checking. Hm. It is surprising how rarely fare dodgers excuse not having a ticket using the dichotomy paradox. Yeah, Zeno of Elea would argue locomotion is impossible, ergo the bus isn't moving, ergo what's to pay for? [ticket controller 2] Yeah, which brings us to the problem. Do you have any ID? To your health. [ticket controller 2] We don't like to resort to using force... - [phone ringing] - ...but would you listen to us otherwise? Gentlemen, I have a very important meeting. - I have to take this. - All right. I'm sorry. He fucked up and won't be there. - That takes care of that. - Here you go. - What, are you nuts? - How so? - Let me go, you bastard! - [laughs] [chuckles, sighs] - You aren't gonna believe it. - [Kasia] I won't. I wouldn't believe it either. I don't give a shit... if you were abducted by aliens... [sighs] ...an elderly nympho, or boy scouts. I only wish that you were dead. [chuckles] But you wouldn't want me to go work for the competition. Go ahead. - They're just waiting, you know. - Go on then! Before I tear out your eyeballs! [sad music playing] [sighs] Are you getting in? Madzia, thanks. Chillax. The sooner you move out of my place the better. Uh, what about your parents? Hmm. [music continues] [insistent knocking] [music fades] [laughs uneasily] Hi. - What kind of a greeting is that? - I thought you were dead. - Your sense of humor's improved. - We haven't spoken for ages. All right. Are you going to let me in or do you want to do this in the hall? [scoffs] - Uh, did you come to say goodbye? - Nice place you got. - Are you going somewhere? - [grunts] No. I just wanted to come see you. [sighs] Now look at me in the eye and say that again. Listen. You won't believe what happened. - No. I know I won't. - But you'll be happy. - Yeah? - [Tomek] I was fired from my job. I lost my apartment as well, my car, and everything else. But what does that have to do with me? Go rent a place. Yeah. I'm completely broke. Are you serious? But you've been making so much money! Do you know much it costs to live in this city? Uh, yeah, I do. I was taking about... [chuckles] [chuckles] Well, this wasn't it. So my dirty little hovel, it's not to your liking, huh, sir? Then I don't understand what you're doing here... [grunts] ...since this is just, it's just a dingy little flat. Get out of here. [laughs] Will you calm down, please? Chill. Just for one night. Come on. [scoffs] - [Tomek chuckles] - The sofa. [footsteps receding] [Tomek] The sofa's just fine. [keyboard clicking] Well? Do you wanna go out? - [keyboard clicking] - [scoffs] I... I have a job, okay? - Come on, work can wait. - Well, it didn't wait for you, did it? Come on, you can chill out a little. Let's go have some fun, get hammered, and pick up some honeys. [keyboard clicking] I just... sorry, but I don't really feel the need to. All right. [inhales] Could I ask you for a little... a little favor? [scoffs] I knew it. Give someone an inch, and they're gonna take a mile. - [Tomek] It's just a small favor. - [keys clicking] I need you to hack into the city's surveillance system for footage from outside the office this morning. - [keys stop] - I met a real knock-out there today. I have no intention of helping you satisfy your primal urges. - I'm not hacking into anything. - Sure, but she really might be the one. [man] Yeah, sure she is. - I've only heard that a thousand times. - [keyboard clicking] I'm a collector. Women are like flowers. They only bloom while under my gaze and tender touch. Flowers, my friend, they look so much better when they're in a big bouquet. [laughs] But I guess you wouldn't know. You're into cacti. So what do you say? Will you do it for me? Why don't you give it up already? Why don't you pull that big stick out of your ass? - [melancholy music playing] - [sighs] [door opens and closes] [exhales] [sighs] I know, Gauss. We're going to get through it, all right? He'll be leaving tomorrow. [exhales] Hiya, Karol. [chuckles] You know my talents. And I've recently become available. Listen, man, after that last stunt you pulled, - you're finished in this industry. - [shutter clicking] What happened anyhow? How'd you screw it up so bad in the final stretch, dude? She was some piece of ass, huh? Didn't I warn you? I told you. This weakness of yours will be your downfall. Yeah. Hey, you got a cigarette, man? - I don't smoke. - Well... I'll take five bucks, then. Or whatever you got. Here. Take it. - Really? - Cheers. Yeah. [laughs] Hey. Hey, thank you, sir! Ah, thank you! ["How Can I Love You" by Ashley Thomas playing in the club] Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry. Uh. [chuckles] Midas? Dude! [laughs] It's been too long. [Midas] Don Tomas. - Hey. - How's it going? Ah, when it rains, it pours. Terrible. Would you have a job for me by any chance? Look, I don't shoot anymore. Well, not in Poland. Too crowded here. - I'm moving to Hollywood. - That's big. Uh, two vodkas, if you please, sir. - Make that four. - Or maybe eight of them? [chuckles] [grunts softly] It's actually a wedding. You, King Midas, stooping so low for a gig like that? You know, I had an accident. I got a DUI, which means that... Right, Hollywood isn't gonna call now. - That's the thing. - [glasses clink] - All right. - [Tomek] Hmm. Look, they offered me a deal. If I film this wedding, they'll give me back my passport. So, what am I supposed to do? Listen, I will film the wedding using a couple of cameras, maybe a crane, a drone, an articulated arm. Tarantino style. And you can do the making of, some talking heads and whatnot, behind the scenes stuff. Nah, I don't know if it's my kind of thing. Come on, let's do it, Tomek. You'll make a lot of money, meet a lot of influential people. - So, whose wedding is it? - [Midas clears throat] Whoa-ho! Minister Kosecki. What do you know. He's a... big deal. This is the guy who's running the whole show. - So he's the guy? - Of course not. It's his son. - And this is the honorable Mrs. Minister. - [Tomek] I've seen her somewhere before. She was an actress when she was younger, but she was pretty terrible. She caught on quick and married a politician. Here's to her health. [clears throat] - [woman laughing] - Well, that's great. Thank you very much. Thanks. ["Libiamo ne' lieti calici" from La Traviata playing] [man humming "Libiamo ne' lieti calici"] [humming continues] [humming intermittently] [music stops] - [humming stops] - [footsteps tapping] [humming] ["Libiamo ne' lieti calici" resumes] [music continues] - [woman] Here you are. - [man] Thank you again. - [woman] Good luck. - [man] Thanks a lot. - [footsteps approaching] - [woman hums "Libiamo ne' lieti calici"] [sneezes loudly] [clears throat, sniffs] - [sniffs, exhales] - [woman continues humming] [exhales] Good morning. Oh, good morning. [chuckles] I've got the plant that you ordered. From Bolivia. Blossfildia liliputana? [gasps] It's so... pretty, isn't it? [woman] I know, right? - And yet it's so small. - [man chuckles] It's going to need a lot of light and tenderness. I... [chuckles nervously] I'll take care of it. And keep it away from drafts too. O... Of course. Yeah. Yes, and thanks for the advice. [softly] Yeah. And how is Stefan Banach doing? And um, and the other one, with its prickles like the spiral of Fi... - Filius Fibonacci. - Filius Fibonacci! - Perfectly! And uh... - Yeah? Möbius sprouted like a lateral... a... a lateral shoot. That's incredible. That means it wants you to reproduce right now. - That's... - Uh, proliferously, of course. I mean... [giggles] Yes, of course. [inhales tremulously, sneezes] Oh! [chuckles] God bless you. - Thanks. I'm sorry. - [chuckles] No. I can help out with that if you would like. - Help out? - Uh, with the reproduction, I mean. [inhales sharply] You need to grab it by the stem firmly, and... - [gasps] - ...tear it off. [exhales] Oh, tear it off. Well, I... I... [man gasps] Uh... - [man sneezes] - [footsteps receding rapidly] [pot clatters] 170... I mean 17. No, 28. - [pot clatters] - [chuckles] - [sneezes] - [laughing] I don't believe it. I can't believe you fell in love with a flower girl. What's so funny about that? - The fact that you're allergic to flowers. - But I'm not allergic to cacti. [laughs loudly] Nah, it'll never work. I know about this stuff. Unless I help you. But you have to help me. Hacking is an actual crime, you know. Besides, I can't tolerate parasites. Fine. I'll pay you rent for the right to sleep on your broken sofa. - I thought you didn't have any money. - I don't, but I have a gig. And it's a gig for two. I don't understand why I should help you. I don't even like you, man. - 'Cause you'll make some cash. - [scoffs] And I, as your brother and your friend, I'm gonna help you score that chick. - I'll show you what to do. - Her name is Klara. And I don't want any advice from you, you pathetic Casanova. [footsteps receding] - [laughs] - [alarm beeps] [Tomek] Oh! There. There you go. Get lost. [sighs] All right. Before I go, let me give you one more piece of advice for free. When you make your move, you should make it on neutral ground. Neutral ground? Outside the store. - No, no, I told you... - Let's practice together! You gotta keep asking her questions. - 'Cause women really love when we do that. - About what? Anything. Okay, you be Klara, and I'll be you. Hello there, Klara. What's up, girl. How you doin'? I'm so sorry for running out on you last time and forgetting to pay for the cactus. [gasps] - [laughs] - Oh! [groans] [sighs deeply] Hello. [sensually] Hello there. [chuckles] - [grunts] - That must've hurt. [chuckles] I... I'm all right, miss. I... I'm sorry that earlier... - I... I forgot to pay you. - No! No, it's all right. It's cool. Well, I just wanted to... to tell you that... Well, I've been thinking... What about? It's just that I wanted to... No, well, um... I was actually thinking that... What is it you've been thinking? That maybe we could together... I mean, you and I could just go out and... Yeah. If you want. I'm going to the bank now. Would you want to me walk me there? [nervously] Mm-hmm. [hesitates] How is the new purchase doing? - [hesitates] Leibniz? - Interesting name. [laughs] - [laughing] Sure. - Is he named after the mathematician? Yeah. [chuckles nervously] Uh... Um... I put him next to Skłodowska. [laughs] A... And did you know you can graft them together? Graft them together? N... No. How? Well, you just make a hole in Skłodowska, then stick your little Leibniz in there. - [chuckles] - Oh, uh, using what? I mean, we could do it together in the flower shop, if you want to. - I would love to. - Maybe we should be less... formal. - My name is Klara. - Yes, I mean, my name is Janek. Okay. - [kissing] - [Klara chuckles nervously] - It's three times. [laughs] - [chuckles] Uh, maybe we could go somewhere? - You mean out together somewhere? - Mm-hmm. - Like where? - Well... - Everywhere. - [chuckles] Out for coffee or food somewhere. [softly] Sorry. - Uh, to a movie or the park or... - That's not the best idea. I... I know that seems, um, a... a little fast, but I... I've never really felt... Uh, no, it's not about you. - It's about me. Um... - Ah. - I'm just not the right girl for you. - I... I get it. Yeah. And I'm very sorry. I promise I won't be bothering you, well, anymore. [rhythmic music playing] AMBER PALACE It's only a week until the wedding. I'm totally against any changes. But my brother and I are just filming the making of. And the actual video will be filmed by Midas. Midas. Whatever he touches just... I'll have words with him. Please don't do that. Please. It's all my fault. You need to fight for your own happiness. Like in the cult film, Fight for Your Happiness. You've seen Fight for Your Happiness? - It's my favorite film. - But that was ages ago. I know all of your films by heart. All of them? Both, right? And your role in Melons and Felons was just... Polish cinema has never seen another star with sex appeal like yours. You just have to act again. For all of us. For your country who loves you. [inhales] And the camera, it will love me too, right? Without a doubt. They used to say I could work in Hollywood. [chuckles] But not anymore. You still look fantastic. You look incredible. You look amazing! [gasps] Finally, someone who gets it. Tomasz? Was that your name? - Yes. - Call me... Patsy. Now, please sign this. And I welcome you both aboard! Uh, what is this? A non-disclosure agreement. What you're going to see here is absolutely top secret. If you whisper a word to anyone... My husband, you know who he is? - Hmm. - Exactly. Well, when he throws someone in jail, I'm totally sorry for them. All right then. And you? Are you mute? [chuckles] Why aren't you talking? Nah, he's just a bit slow. You don't have to worry about him. My daughter-in-law has arrived. I mean my future daughter-in-law, obviously. - [phone rings] - Oh, excuse me. Hello? [Patsy] Hello? Hi there. [groans] Uh, Ola. Tomek. [inhales sharply] Lovely name. I guess everything about you is lovely. - You're getting married? - That's right. - Well, my condolences. - [sighs] What's that? What are you doing? Oh, well, I just saw you on that bus. What are the odds? And now you're right here in front of me. I just wanna see what'll happens. [grunts] - [Ola] Now you know. - [Tomek chuckles] Okay. I'm very sorry. Can we just start over? - You're an idiot. - Reprobate, miscreant, and scoundrel. What are you laughing at? This is exactly how great love stories begin. - [huffs] - [Patsy] Well? Let's start getting down to work. Oh, but we are. We are getting down to work. [laughs] [melancholy music playing] [Janek softly] Damn it. [Janek grunts] [grunts, sighs] I'm sorry, but how long are you planning on feeling sorry for yourself? Fight for her, man. - Fight for happiness. - [scoffs] - But she rejected me. - Bullshit. I've seen how she looks at you. - How? - The same way you look at her, man. No, she said herself we're just not right for each other, and it's not a good idea. - [Tomek] Listen. - Hmm. For such an intelligent guy, you're as naive as a child. - [sighs] It's all part of the game. - Part of what game? The conquering game. You get to be manly. She doesn't have to be easy. You both win. So the reason Ola slapped you like that was to conquer you? - Hmm. [sips] Brilliant deduction. - [glass clatters] [scoffs] Except she's getting married. I can't discriminate against married women. - That wouldn't be nice of me. - [scoffs] Ola will be mine anyway. - [laughs] Yeah, you go on dreaming. - Wanna bet? That's a bet. Totally. We need to change the menu. We've got 30 guests allergic to shellfish, 40 to nuts, 16 to citrus fruits, and 200 gluten and lactose. Put some gold flakes in. No one's allergic to gold. What about the flatware? Uh, I have an invoice for the insurance company right here. Phew! That's great. The tableware will be gold as well, just like Melania, because everyone says I look like her. [chuckles] No, Melania would be lucky just to wash your dishes. - You're divine, Patsy. - [upbeat music playing] [mockingly] Got it? - [scoffs] - [Tomek] You got it? Attention! What's that supposed to be? That isn't the right look. - Where are their wigs? - They're coming. - And the tights? - Uh... Shoulders down. Shave. Smile. Wait. It's better if they don't smile. Positions! [music stops] Right turn! Start! - And action! - [upbeat music resumes] Move it, move it, gentlemen. One, two. One, two, Posture now! Keep your backs straight. And keep your distance from everyone else, please. [Tomek] So is it a costumed wedding then? Don't be ridiculous. - This is just rehearsal dinner. - Uh-huh. The actual wedding will be at the Royal Castle. - Whoa. - [chuckles] But that is, of course, absolutely top secret. [Tomek] Wow. Well... [clears throat] ["Spring" by Vivaldi plays] Our event, uh, echoes the greatness of the Polish Nobles' Commonwealth. Kuba Wojewódzki will be hosting and ensuring the right ambience. The music will be provided by Ed Sheeran, together with Beyoncé and Zenek Martyniuk. Get that out of my face! At the stroke of midnight... [giggles] ...a spectacular fireworks will light up the sky all over Warsaw. [chuckles] Wow. Our President will be there. The US President will totally be there. He's a friend of ours. Along with members of the government, VIPs, over a thousand guests. That's going to cost a fortune. My husband has access to a dedicated fund from the Crisis Shield. Our little prince... [laughs] ...is going to get a wedding like this country has never seen before. Mm-hmm. But that's totally, absolutely... - Top secret. - Top secret. So, uh, my son's wedding is on Saturday and on Sunday, my husband's election. - [wedding planner] Mm-hmm. - Pretty clever, modesty apart. [chuckles] What the fuck! - Are you out of your mind?! - What is it? Councilman Paweł Zgrabny and Senator Pizana at the same table? - Ugh! - I'm so sorry! I'll change it right away. It's a total bloodbath. Don't film this. Stop filming! Don't you film this! What about the balloons? Where the hell are the balloons? And... Ugh. [wedding planner] The Great Hall has a mural by Bacciarelli. - It's a masterpiece. And balloons... - [Patsy] It'll look better with balloons. - Right, Ola? Aleksandra! - What? Yes, balloons will be much better. Kris is calling. Hello, darling? Yes, I miss you too. Everything's under control. [softly] I'm trying, but she's driving me crazy. All right. Here it is. - Visualization. - See? It's better with balloons. - Hello? Are you getting this right now? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. The release mechanism needs improvement, but in general, the balloons look very good. [playful music playing] [huffs] [gasps, huffs] [gulps] [gasps, grunts] [sniffs] Are you filming? [Tomek] Yes, I am. Shall we? - Mm-hmm. - [Tomek] All right. Uh, why don't you tell us something about your future daughter-in-law? I hope that Aleksandra is going to be a very good wife to my son. After all, he chose her himself. And Krystian has always had great taste, totally luxurious. - When he was an altar by, he... - [phone ringing] Just hold one second. Hello? What do you mean he didn't come? Hold on. Wait a second. She didn't say much about you. - So how about you tell us a little more? - No. Come on, please. Don't make this difficult. Whatever you want. About your family, I don't know. I'm an orphan. My grandma raised me. - And that's all? - Yeah. Well, all right. How many of your people are you inviting to this totally great wedding of yours? [sighs] My grandma and two bridesmaids. Only three people? Out of a thousand? [gentle music playing] [clears throat] Can you look at the camera? There! - [sighs deeply] - [clears throat] [Tomek] I'd really like to... get to know you. So, tell me about yourself. I looked for you on social media, and you're not there. - [shutter clicks] - Are you a spy or something? - [chuckles] I'm a student. - [shutter clicks] Okay. Of what? Romance Studies. Ooh! What year? - I'm writing my master's now. - What about? About courtly love. About courtly love? Courtly love is the archetype of what we call passionate love, crazy, against everything and everyone. But for you, I'm sure it's an abstraction. And do you really know what true passion is? [chuckles] All right, tell me more. Recite a fragment of something for me. "My lords, if you would hear a high tale of love and death..." - Oh! Tristan and Isolde. - Have you read it? Of course I have. "...how to their full joy, but to their sorrow also." "They loved each other, and how at last they died..." - "...of that love..." - "...together upon one day, she by him..." - "...and he by her. Amour et mort.” - "...and he by her. Amour et mort.” - And what is the supposed to mean? - It's about love and death. Okay. Don't you have something to edit? - Like what? - Go look over the footage. - "Amour et mort.” [laughs] - [Ola] "Amour et mort.” All right then. Love and death. What about it? Love only moves us when death looms over it. Love playing with risk, love on the edge, love that ignores all the rules. [playful music playing] Oh! [grunts] Help me up, you moron. - [Tomek laughs] - Well?! [music continues] [speaking French] - [sniffs] Ah. - [music stops] What do you mean they ordered first? They're my flowers. What do I care about some First Holy Mass? Whose son? Ah. I understand. In a cathedral, lilies would look much better, right? The camellias are mine. And you better bring them over here right fucking now! - [sighs] - [phone beeps] I'm generally good-natured, but sometimes I get totally pissed off. Hey, I know of a great place to get flowers. Low prices. [ironically] Low prices. Aw, what's with you, Aleksandra? You look totally flushed. Take something. I don't want you ruining the wedding because of some... - [loud clattering] - ...some virus. Oh! - [Tomek] What are you doing? - Uh, I didn't touch it. Look? So tell me, is your loving mother-in-law giving you trouble? Well, she keeps shouting at everyone, pushing me around like furniture. She wanted me to get a nose job, but she couldn't risk it not healing in time. - And what does Kris say? - He's still in Dubai. [grandmother] He should be supporting you. He can see how much his mother cares. She insisted on paying for everything. - Wait, but I bought the dress. - [chuckles] Let's have another drink. The only thing I fought for were the vows. It will be quiet, modest, normal. Ola, dear, what on earth is the matter? [sighs] You should be positively buzzing with joy right now. - [chuckles] - And you look so worried. You look miserable. - That's what love does to some people. - What nonsense. - [iron hissing] - When I was getting married... Grandma, actually, your marriage was not a model relationship. - Which one? With Stefan? - [chuckles] We were crazy for each other. I don't want to hear about that. We only got out of bed when we were weak with hunger. The rest of the time we were busy buzzing. [Ola huffs] But the most important thing is just that he's someone who can make you truly happy. I am happy. Kris fulfills my every wish. Is it buzzing? - What? - You know. Does your body buzz when you're with him? [laughs] Dude, this whole courtly love thing is actually pretty cool. They kept getting into love triangles. The Lady cheats on her Lord with a sexy knight. Now that's the kind of thing I like to hear. [laughs] - Why didn't we learn thins in school? - You know what? You have a very... [sighs] ...one-track mind. You simplify everything. [panting] Listen, I know you don't need my advice, but... maybe a little? [panting] Ah. Hmm.

I would never make fun of you, sir. I'm sorry about last time. Well, we could always be friends, or... Start over? - Janek. - Klara. - [giggles] - Janek. Uh, what do you think about... about what's going on in the world? About what? The whole global situation. Like in Africa or in the Middle East? Um, I guess in general? I'm generally worried about... - A... about what? - [giggles] - Well, in general. - Ah. Um, and in detail? In detail? Well, about the climate crisis, the economic crisis, the destruction of tropical rain forests... - Ah. - ...terrorism, the pandemic, um, all the children starving in Africa... Uh... A-and in Ethiopia? Well, yes, of course. You can't have all the world's problems on your shoulders. - Or can you? - [woman shrieking] Is that you, honey-bunny? Where were you? Wow, you look so handsome, so elegant. - I've missed you so much. [smooching] - But... - What are you doing, ma'am? - What, don't you recognize me? No. Please leave me alone. You're a lunatic! Hello, hello, excuse me. Uh... - Is this guy bothering you, ma'am? - What? - She's the one bothering me. - No. Calm down. Calm down! Should we calm him down for you? It's just our little lovers' spat. Right, honey-bunny? - Who are you? - [giggles] Get out. Get out! What's up? You hired that crazy woman to embarrass and humiliate me. But... What is this is about? Klara. She... She... She took off. - She was crying. - She was crying? - I think so. - That's good. - That means to her, you're important. - Well, to me, you're just an asshole. Chill out. - Everything is going to plan then. - Oh yeah? What plan? Since time immemorial, lovers have conquered obstacles, haven't they? Hamlet and Ophelia, Romeo and Juliet... To get your happy ending, you've gotta use your noodle. Wh... What happy ending? They all die, you dolt! [pants] - Just trust me. - [groans] ["Serenade No. 13 in G Major 'A Little Night Music'" playing] - Ha. This is my design. Do you like it? - Yeah? Nice. - [Ola] I have to go home. - [Patsy] Out of the question. I really do. Aleksandra, am I asking too much of you? I just want... [sighs] I expect a little more support from you. - That's all. - I didn't want a wedding like this. - I wanted a modest... - Modest? What will people say? And the opposition? That my husband doesn't adhere to the most important values? Every girl dreams of a fairy-tale wedding. - Would you let me explain? - [Patsy] I'm talking now! And you, try not to forget that you're joining our family. That's our family. Our position has certain obligations. My husband is about to become president. - That's great. Excuse me. Excuse me! - [scoffs] Why are you just standing there? Bring her back now! And why are you standing there? Are you recording the cake? All right, let's start from scratch. [Tomek] Hold on. [panting] You can't drive in this condition. Let me drive you. [camera shutter clicking] - [Ola] How is your contract of a lifetime? - [Tomek] Ah, they weren't worth it. You know, I got through your Tristan and Isolde. - Got through it? - Yeah. - Any thoughts? - Well, it's an interesting story. She gets forcibly engaged to that king, falls in with Tristan, and they're together for the rest of their lives. I know it by heart. I don't need your cliff notes. Any opinions of your own? - Well, you were really screwed over. - [Ola laughs] - And by you, I mean women. - Mm-hmm. Forced into marriage against your will for financial reasons. You think a little orphan girl snagged a Prince Charming? - Fell for his money and status? - No, I'm just offering to be your Tristan. In case you have a dragon you need to hunt. Thanks, no need. [chuckles] That's pretty convenient. Eh? [chuckles] You get married, consummate with your husband, and then... sleep with whoever you want. You're unbelievable. - That's how the book goes. - All right, stop digging your own grave. [sighs] [panting] Grandma, are you all right? Bronek called to say you weren't answering your phone. Bronek? He's hysterical. Stubborn like an ox, and he won't see a doctor. I just broke up with him. [gasps] - Good morning. - Good morning. - This is Tomek. He's filming a making of. - Wh... What does that mean? - Uh, it's a film about the film. - Ah. Thanks. You can go now. Ola, dear. Why don't you make some tea. And you, sonny, get the cake and some plates. - [sighs] - [chair squeaks] - [teapot clatters] - [water running] - That's when the mother-in-law... - [phone vibrating] ...said that if they skimp on the wedding, it would totally ruin their prestige. - [laughing] - [laughing] Totally. Let them fall. [Tomek laughing] - [phone vibrating] - [Grandma] Such a nice boy. - Hmm? - Do you see any faults in yourself? - Mm-hmm. - Too bad you've gotta go, Tomek. - It was a pleasure. - [with mouth full] A lot of 'em. [laughs] Gluttony, lack of manners. [chuckles] Excuse me. [Grandma laughs] Laziness, thoughtlessness, unreliability, impulsiveness, weakness for the fairer sex, unstable emotions. - [Grandma laughing] - I could go through the whole alphabet. It's unbelievable. He's the spitting image of your late grandfather. - That rascal. - But I believe in love. - What do you mean? - Grandma, don't listen to him. I believe love can change a person. [gentle music playing] That when we love, we become better. And the world around us becomes better too. You should write that down. Poetry. [Tomek chuckles softly] [Grandma] One more piece? - I'll take it if you're not gonna eat it. - [cutlery clinks] [Tomek, with mouth full] Mmm. Delicious! - [phone vibrating] - Oh geez, I'm sorry! - Hello? - [Janek] Where are you right now? Patsy is apoplectic. A rascal, but you can tell that he likes you, dear. [plates clink] - What are you talking about? - About the way he looks at you. - What way? - What else? Things are buzzing! Grandma! It's true! Buzzing. Buzzing. - [gentle music continues] - [sighs softly] [Klara screams] - Thief! - Stay there! [panting] - [straining] - [bird flaps wings] Boo! [laughing] - It's you? - Who else? - How could you do that? - [laughs] How could you, huh? Destiny needs a little help. - You're a thief. - Well then, snitch on me. - Why didn't you warn me first? - I wanted you to look natural. And you did. Here you go. You... - What's going on here? - It's him! What? Gentlemen, what are you... [grunts] It wasn't me! Yeah, very good! That's right. Gentlemen, it's not him! - No, no, no! It's not him! - Take this... What? - I'm telling you, it's not him! - [Janek groaning] - It's not him. - Ah. - Are you okay? - Yeah. [grunts] - [huffs] - Does it hurt? Not at all. [straining] [breathing deeply] [romantic music playing] May I? I really like you a lot, Klara. I like you too. But that's why we can't. Why not? Yeah. I don't want you on my conscience. But what are you... There's some kind of curse over me. Every guy that I... [exhales] One died in a motorbike accident, another disappeared in a trekking trip in Asia. The third one had a great business that suddenly went bankrupt. That's why I dress like this, in these rags, these jumpsuits, so people don't see me because I'm afraid that if... [both moaning] All right. - I don't want to rush into things. - I understand. All right, the asymptote can wait. It can wait. And we can do it whenever you're ready. Thank you. You are so... So... - You're like a lion. - Wait! I... Oh! - Oh! - No, no, no, stop whining. [dreamy French song playing] [music stops] [Tomek laughing louder] - Ah! - I forgot my key. - [chuckles] - I can see you're in a good mood. - Oh, well... [chuckles] - No, I don't believe it. [laughs] - Mm-hmm. - Seriously? Did you manage to get your stem in her flower bud? You're just pathetic. But I was right. Your shared trauma brought you together. - But it was completely staged. - But you didn't know that. Well, now I know. And... I'm done. I'm done filming. Thanks to me, you got your flower in just a few days. - And you want to abandon me? - Ola is too nice for you, man. And you're just trying to ruin her life for fun, but I won't let you. We had a deal. You promised to help me. - Because I wanted you to leave. - No, you can't abandon me. Look who's talking? The runaway king. - [scoffs] What are you talking about? - You know perfectly well. - [sad music playing] - Where were you when mom died? I was studying. Studying? You call that studying? Parties, chicks, that's all you cared about. That's not true. - You can't abandon me. - Actually I can. No! - Yes. - No, man! - Yes! - No! - [both grunting] - [sinister music playing] [metal door unlocks] [music fades] [metal door closes] Do you know who I am? Smyra. Don Smyra. Th... Th... The greatest Polish... Polish gangster. It's bull crap. Georgie. Georgie here is... [chuckles] ...a terrible criminal, - but his cooking is five-star. - [scissors clank] Please, have a seat. Georgie, what did you make for us? Oh, a classic, Mr. Smyra. Homard grillé au béarnais Lobster, a delicious breakfast. Grab yourself a claw. And bon appetit. Now to the point. I was supposed to get out on parole. And I would have, if not for Kosecki, who's targeting me with a new investigation. That's interesting, but what does it have to do with us? Although I'm sitting here, I have eyes and ears everywhere. So... What do you see? - I see you. - Me? A cheap Casanova. And what you're up to. - And what am I up to? - No good! If Kosecki Junior doesn't get married tomorrow, then I... Then you're screwed. Then I'm screwed. And then that would make you what? Screwed also? Screwed also, worse than a turkey at Thanksgiving. First thing I'll do is hurt your loved ones. - Yeah, but we don't have family. - And the flower girl? [gasps] I mean, she just sells cacti and... Hold on. Just a moment, one moment. Hold on. I don't understand. One more time from the beginning. What does Kosecki never stop talking about? The death penalty. He's obsessed with that shit. The death penalty is the second most important to... family. If I'm family, he'll have to kill the investigation. Get it? Ola is my flesh and blood. [Janek] What? So Kosecki didn't check her out? He tried to. But I erased any records long ago. So then, Ola and Kosecki Junior's wedding is a setup? Do you take me for an asshole who would use his kid? No, not at all. So no more making-of? Quite the opposite. You'll finish your gig, of course. I can't wait to have such a wonderful souvenir. Now, dig right in. Come on. - Ah! - Ow! - [groans] - [pants] How many girls have you dumped? Hmm, a few. But I'm sure they're much happier now, believe me. Why do you ask? Because for the first time in my life, I wish I were like you. A heartless Casanova. - Hey, babe. - Hi. Whassup? - [exhales] - [Klara] Hmm. Coming in? [exhales] Nah. [exhales] I've gotta go. I've got a date with a chick. I mean, sorry it didn't work out. Are you high right now? What? Huh? N... No, but I plan to be. It's not about you. Please don't make that face. It's me. I need more space and... Well, you... you know, we... we had some fun, coco-jumbo and all that. [sighs] We never promised anything, yeah? Please, just don't start crying, all right? Co... Coco-jumbo and all that? - I don't get it. - [groans] Yesterday you said you liked me, and today... And today is today. That's life, babe. Everything's got an end, right? So, well... See you. [footsteps receding rapidly] [car stops] [handbrake creaks] [car door closes] - [clears throat] - [Tomek] Okay... If you'll just sign right here, we can get started. What is that? It's an annex. The final cut belongs to us. Right. May I ask you, Kris, to clap for the microphone, so we can sync the audio? - Me? - Yeah. [groans] One moment. Right here.Here. [clap] Oh sorry, one more time. - [clap] - [laughs softly] Okay. - When did you get together? - Over a year. One year, two months, five days, and... eight hours. It was love at first sight. Oh incredible. I thought things like that only happen in movies. Well, as you can see, life writes the best stories. [Tomek] Uh, okay, and where did you meet? - At a wedding. - [chuckles] Ola's friend and my friend, it was their wedding, you know? It was a sign. Uh, what sign? From above. We were simply destined for each other. [Tomek] Wow. that is incredibly romantic. And what was it like from your perspective, Ola? Same feeling. You're such a lucky guy, Kris. You never had any competition. And what do you think about the institution of marriage? Well, that's pretty obvious. Marriage is a religiously consecrated bond between two people, which confirms their love through a sacrament. And what about you? - A romantic journey into the unknown. - Oh! A journey. Very well put. - Like Columbus' journey. - [Ola] Exactly. Yes. You're Columbus, and I'm America, which you're trying to plunder. [chuckles] - I'm sorry. That's not what... - [chuckles] Is... Is it just me or are these questions stupid? - Uh, the viewers would like to know. - Excuse me, what viewers? Well, how about... their children. They'll want to see how their parents got it all started. Which reminds me, uh... Children, I assume you're gonna wanna have them, right? Uh, you're having unprotected sex, right? You're being vulgar. I don't appreciate it. - Let's end this circus. Let's finish. - All right. - Do you mind one last question? - No. We know how your relationship began, but where was the first time for you? - Sex before marriage is a sin. - Yeah. So, you haven't done it? [laughs] No, we haven't. - Are we done? - Yeah! [chuckles] [Patsy] The Minister is here. Great. [chuckles] [camera shutter clicking] Welcome back, sir. Uh, your speech, sir. - For the Floor? - No, this one is for Kris's wedding. Darling, these are the filmmakers. Take that away. Take that... [Tomek] Just one quick question. What are your hopes for the marriage of your firstborn son? Marriage. First of all, we should define what exactly it is. It's a religiously consecrated bond between two people who love each other. And of course, it's the foundation of any family. Uh, and family is a sacred repository... - You've got some kind of fluff here. - [Patsy] Yeah. I noticed that earlier. - Take care of it. - [Patsy] All right. - You could see that. - [Patsy] It's fine. Calm down. [Tomek] I'm sorry, Minister. Marriage is the foundation family, and family is a repository of the greatest values and traditions that our ancestors fought for, so we could live free and procreate for the ultimate benefit of our most dearly beloved homeland. That's why my presidential administration will... be focused on... family values. All right then... [clears throat] We'll be welcoming distinguished guests at exactly 5 p.m. Thank you for honoring us with, um, your presence. Keep moving. Keep moving. Merci de nous honorer de votre présence. Grazie per onorarci con la tua presenza. - Signora, tutto perfetto! - Good, keep talking. Let's move on. Hey. All right. Okay. Everyone sits down now. The time is now, wait, let's see, 6.03 p.m. Time for the bridegroom's father's speech. [wedding planner] One sentence, I think is very important... All right, all right. I'm sure it'll be beautiful and moving. Everyone is totally crying now. - We're crying. That's right. - [guests crying] Keep crying! - Did I say something funny? - No. - So, what's so funny to you? - Nothing. Lately, you've been acting... pretty distracted, you know. I'm sorry. [chuckles] All right, the minister has finished. And now, eh... Applause, applause. - [scattered applauding] - Is that what you call applause? - Standing ovation. - [wedding planner] More! - [applauding intensifies] - Applause! Stand up! Stand up! - Kosecki! - [guests chanting] Kosecki for President! For President! For President! Kosecki! Kosecki! For President! For President! Kosecki! - [chanting and applauding fade] - Thank you. Thank you, everyone. I promise you I will stand guard and protect our true Polish families. We will not let our enemies undermine Poland or our traditional family values. Don't make a fool of yourself. It's a rehearsal. - What? - It's just a rehearsal. - Oh. - Where are you going? Um, we're about to practice some wedding games now. [chuckles] - I have a government meeting to get to. - Fuck the government! When people see online you're one of them, your polls are totally going up. If you think so, sweetheart. Oh, don't mess with my hair. ["Infernal Galop" playing] [music stops] [scattered laughing] [music resumes] No! Stop, stop, stop, stop! This just isn't right. - What are you going on about? - We're in here, in our grand Polish home. We're not going to dance to foreign music. - ["King Wladyslaw Jagiello" playing] - Ah! There we go! [music stops] [guests laughing] [music resumes] [music stops] [guests laughing softly] [music resumes] [music stops] - [guests laughing] - [Patsy] Kosecki for president! He did it again. He's fighting like it's the presidential chair. [guests chanting] ...for President! Kosecki for President! - [sad music playing] - [dog barking in distance] One, two. [clears throat] Now, the most beautiful moment of the entire evening. I present to you the newlyweds, Krystian and Aleksandra. Um, Krystian isn't here. Sorry. He's out multiplying the GDP. [chuckles] - Tomasz, could you take his place? - Me? - [Patsy] If you wouldn't mind. - Uh, I'm sure I won't be as good as he is. I know. Of course not, but it's only a rehearsal. - [sighs] - All right. Hold this. - What now? - Nothing. Stand there. [waltz playing] Oh, you asked for it. [laughs] - Do you have to suck up to her so much? - What? Are you jealous? - Are you enjoying it? - What? Being such an asshole. [laughs] Being an asshole is my specialty. [Ola] What are you...

Oh, woah. Patsy, what are you doing?

Looking at you, I see myself. Yeah? - So, what do we have in common then? - [man] A lot more than you think. Back in the day, I looked... different. I had a great job. I had a great marriage. Until my Zuzia started sleeping with her boss. I kicked her out and started drinking. I was planning on killing the both of them. But then the more I wanted the more I drank, and before long, I lost my grip. - What happened then? - [man] Time passed. Then I just lived like a bum. Nine years at rock bottom. And then one day my buddy took me to a job, renovating a house. I go with him and who do I see? Zuzia. My Zuzia. She looked more beautiful than ever. - I thought my heart would break. - Did she see you? Who notices a worker in their home? I only talked to her husband, so... [inhales sharply] It was the same fucker that she had cheated on me with. So, what? You get your revenge? Actually, no. Well, I cried for a while. I could see that she was... flourishing. With children, a lovely house, she was comfortable. I felt such... gratitude to that asshole, that he... he didn't ruin her. [sighs deeply] Is there a moral to this story? Leave her alone. Why? Because I checked you out. You're a horndog and a brokeass. - What could you give her? - True love. True love? You have no idea what true love is. Love isn't about banging. It's not taking. It's giving. I go back there sometimes. I sit in my car and watch Zuzia and cry, out of love and immense joy, that I didn't fuck it up for her. - [metal door slams] - [grunts, groans] [man coughing] JAIL [doorbell chiming] PRESIDENT OF A BRIGHTER TOMORROW [door unlocking] - Good morning. - Hello. I'll marry him. I promise. You're so beautiful. I begot an angel. - Spitting image of your mom. - How can you even mention her? You ruined her life. Mine as well. You're ashamed of me, and you're right to be. Sadly, that was my job. You were a great dad in between your secret missions. Though I never believed in any secret missions. And when I was 11, you disappeared for good. But I always watched over you. How so? Remember that brawler from downstairs who ended up in the hospital? That asshole from Komorów who stalked you? Or the professor who wouldn't give you a passing grade in culture studies unless you were nice to him. You remember? I never asked you for anything, but now I'm asking you for one thing. Let Tomek go. [footsteps receding] - [man] Don't move. - [Janek grunts] I... I've got a proposition for Mr. Smyra. [groaning] Ow! - [groans] - You stay right here. - You too. - [Janek groans] [indistinct music plays on device] - What did you give him? - You'll see in a minute. Uh, one moment. It's not my phone. [silence] - Your eye? - I fell off a horse, man. [Tomek] What horse? A white one. I charged in my shining armor to rescue Klara. [chuckles] [indistinct music playing on phone] Unbelievable. I'm sorry, man. For what? For dragging you into this. And for not helping you with mom. [sad music playing] - Forget about it. You were studying. - Nah. - I was scared. - [Janek] Of what? Watching her fade away. It was annoying that you were the apple of her eye. Get out of here. Mr. Smyra has given you his blessing. [upbeat music playing] [Janek] Slow down. No! Can you slow down? - How did you track me down? - I hacked your GPS. [breaks screech] [Tomek] You won't even jaywalk at a red light. - [breaks screech] - [Janek] Yeah, but you're my brother. Plus, we had a bet. - You won. - [Tomek] And I'm a total asshole. I don't even deserve Ola. [Janek] Yes, that's actually true, but they deserve her even less. I've got the proof on my phone. [anchorwoman] The Royal Castle in Warsaw, the old cradle of the Piast dynasty, destroyed multiple times by invaders from what is today the European Union... OUR COUNTRY TV SWEDISH DELUGE WE WON'T FORGET THE HARM Today Poland will bear witness to joyous modern history. This is the family of a true Polish patriot, Minister Kosecki. You can't see her right now. It's very bad luck. - [Kris] Mom. - Let's go inside. Don't "mom" me. Just go inside. Ignacy. - What's going on? - [hyperventilating] Please don't panic. All right? Just breathe in deeply, all right? And out. Breathe in and out. - Ola, are you not sure? - [breathing heavily] Grandma. [Grandma] Come on, come on, come on. [funk music playing] [Janek] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Watch out! Watch out! [breaks screech] DETOUR There! There, there. Thanks. [breaks screeching] - Move faster, ladies. - [grunts] We are totally behind schedule. - Did something happen? - No, I just... - Have you changed your mind? - [Ola] No, I have to tell you something. - You don't have to. - No, but we have to. We have to trust each other, right? We can't have any secrets from each other. - Everybody has them. - You're keeping secrets? - Of course. - Great. - What's going on? - I can't move! Oh! That's a bad omen! It's bad luck! - You want a punch in the nose? - Sneakers! Yes! Borrowed clothing is good luck. That should counteract the bad luck. Move it! Move it! - Got a signal? - I do, but they're not picking up. [Tomek] Well, just keep calling. Come on, call! [Janek] I am calling. - Still no answer. - [Tomek] Well, call back again. [Janek] I am calling, I am. Can't you see that? Maybe it's started already? [Tomek] Over my dead body! This wedding, taking place on the symbolic date of the Baptism of Poland and the last pilgrimage for the Polish pope to his homeland, will be visited by the most important state figures. The Chairman of the leading party will be there with his cat, Bishops, and wealthy CEOs of various state-owned companies. The bride and groom will also be there. [engine hiccuping, dying down] [huffs] What? What, you wanna give up? Are you giving up right now? You can't! You're Tristan, and you're wearing the shining armor. Can't you see my Bucephalus just kicked the bucket? - Is that gonna stop you? - [upbeat music playing] We are joined here at the studio by Sister Salomea, a consultant on traditional Polish weddings. - Sister, God bless you. - [chuckles] Um, during this wedding of the year, as they're calling this party thrown by Minister Kosecki, Beyonce is going to be singing in English the Pope's favorite song. Sister, tell me, do you think this is appropriate? Shouldn't they have someone who is singing such an important Polish song sing it in the original Polish? - This is not the right time. - What? - You need to give it a rest. - ["Mendelssohn's Wedding March" playing] Not now! [buzzing] - [buzzing intensifying] - [music continues] Throwing a private party in the Royal Castle, is that appropriate? It's not appropriate. It's making a mockery of the Polish people. Dear viewers, the arrogance of this government knows no bounds. [buzzing intensifying] Get rid of the drone. [chuckles] Sir... [panting] ...how much for that piece of junk? - What's your offer? - [groans] - Uh, a hundred? - [laughing] - Not enough. - It's not even worth half that much. Market rule. Supply is subject to demand. - All right, two hundred. - [man] Not enough. Here. This is all I've got. Hmm. Yeah. There. [upbeat music playing] - Yeah. - [grunts] GROCERY STORE What the fuck? - Where is my bike? - There. [music stops] - Hail Mary... - [bells ringing] - [speakers squeal] - Ah! [priest] ...llelujah!

Damn, my... The girl I fell in love with is getting married. That'll work. - [boat engine starts] - [boat horn honks] [choir singing] Know that love is patient, love is merciful... This whirlpool, can you see it? Two lovers drowned over there, for love. - And, uh, you see that tree over there? - It's beautiful. That's where the miller's daughter and the carpenter's son hanged themselves. Also for love. And there, that's where a guy hanged himself after trying to drag a girl away from the altar. Super. I don't know if I'd call it super, but uh... [bells ringing] Repeat the following vows after me. I, Bronisław. Repeat after me. I, Bronisław. I, Krystian. - Krystian? - Krystian. Well, then repeat. You, Krystian. I, Krystian... Agree to take... - [whispering] Aleksandra. - Aleksandra, as my wife. ...agree to take you, Aleksandra, as my wife. - And I vow... - [whispering] To love you. To love you, cherish you, and be faithful to you. And I vow to love you, cherish you, and be faithful to you. [priest] Now you repeat. Hey, buddy! Buddy! What a moron. Uh, I, Aleksandra, take you, Tomasz, uh... as my wedded husband... [priest] Well, Hallelujah. - Hallelujah. - Hallelujah. [upbeat music playing] - [music continues] - Do you enter into holy matrimony out of your own free will? [shouts] No! [music continues] Now you two can go ahead and... [mimics smooching] And Hallelujah. [music continues] - [shouts] No! - [music stops] [panting] You should just tell her the truth. I think I'm gonna sit down. He doesn't love you. [music building up] I'm sorry. [upbeat music playing] - No! - [priest] Oh my God! - [Grandma grunting] - [man] Hallelujah! Hey! Watch where you're driving, moron! [Tomek] Hey! Let's go! - [music fades] - [club music playing on phone] I'm sending it. [music stops] [phone chimes] [club music playing on video] [phone beeps] Where'd you get that from? So you knew? You knew from the start. - [Tomek] Of course you did. - [sighs] How could you make him do it? How could you have done it to both of 'em? What kind of people are you? - What do you want? - [Tomek] Three things. First of all, there was no wedding. The wedding's already over. All it takes is for the priest to not hand over the certifying documents. - Ugh. [chuckles] - [dog barking] That's fine. That frump never really deserved Kris anyway. Second of all, you let Smyra go. Who is Smyra? Ask your husband. Also, Kosecki withdraws from tomorrow's election. Are you high or something? But the... the results are out. He won. IIt's over now. - Oh, well... - [chuckles] The people will just have to figure out a way to get themselves over it. [Patsy] And the reception? What about all the stuff I totally had planned for them? [sighs] It's not fair! [band playing gentle tune] [music fades] ["Chodź, pomaluj mój świat" performed by Iwanek, Fidecka playing] - Yes! - [laughs] Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes! - Yes, yes, yes. Yes. - [chuckles] - Klara... - [softly] Oh... Yes. Yes! Ow! Please, repeat after me. I, Kris... I, Kris... ...take you, Adrian, as my wedded husband. [Kris] ...as my wedded husband. [celebrant] You may now kiss your husband. [cheering, applauding] [song continues] All right. [sniffs, exhales] Category "Weird Polish Wedding Films," the Oscar for Best Direction goes to Kiss, Kiss. That's me. What are you doing, man? Why are you pointing at me? He's the one who wrecked my car. Catch the bandit, man! What are you looking at? [man] What?
