Uh, this one, which is a disaster. The other one is an en suite in my room. Um, this is the spare room. Not much to clean in here. And this. And this is my daughter's. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Pianos, have you ever cleaned them? -Yes. -Eva. Could you stop for a second, please? I'll go get it. Hello. Hi! You play really well. Beautifully, actually. Thank you. I'm Laura. Eva. Here it is. [HUMMING] LAURA: Uh, I'm all done. Okay! Is your room all right? Everything how you like it? Yeah! Yeah, it's, uh, nice and clean. -Thanks. -No problem! [CLEARING THROAT] Bye. I'll see you soon. Okay, bye. I really like your poster, by the way. Oh! Thanks! It's funny, I wouldn't have thought that you were a Nirvana fan, with all the classical music you were playing before. The classical playing is just a thing I have to do right now. Oh, okay. God, could you imagine seeing them live? [CHUCKLES] It would be really intense! It'd be crazy. I have goosebumps just thinking about it. Bye! [FOOTSTEPS RETREATING] [SIGHING] Anyone else would be fired for this. I should fire you. Or take you out of cleaning altogether... keep you in accounting. You don't seem to bother anyone in there. Well, you don't need me full-time in accounting. [SIGHING] I'm sorry. You're always sorry. I mean... I just wanna know what you were thinking. How did you honestly think this one was gonna end? Happily? Did you think about me for a second, about how this could affect me and my business? -No, I guess not. -No, I guess not! [SIGHING] You know what? I've asked you before to leave my employees out of whatever it is you do out there. Well, she'll be happy to know that I find her repulsive now. Honey, I wish you found more people repulsive. Like you? WOMAN: Tell me, are you gonna take a few days off? Because I have to make sure I do the schedule this week. I don't know. Maybe just in the morning... [WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY] -WOMAN: Are you okay? -Hmm? -Are you okay? -Oh, yeah, yeah! WILLIAM: You better jump in there before it's all gone. Uh, that looks burnt. WILLIAM: It is! That's the best part! WOMAN: Just the middle one. This side isn't burnt. Don't forget you promised us... -WOMAN: Good time! -WILLIAM: Yeah, huh? -I'll give you a ride next time. -WILLIAM: Yeah! WOMAN: We had a great night. -WOMAN 2: Thank you so much. -WILLIAM: Thank you! -WOMAN: Thanks for the invite. -WILLIAM: Of course! -WOMAN: Take care! -WOMAN 2: Be safe. -WILLIAM: See you at the office. -WOMAN: Bye, Laura! Bye, guys. You okay to drive? Yeah. -You sure? -Yes. Why don't I give you a ride home? I'll be all right. No, I'll drive you back in the morning, and you could pick up your car. I'm fine. Why, are you, uh... you meeting somebody now? -I'm going home. -Ah! Dad, can I have a couple of smokes for the road? Oh, sure! -Oh, I can give you four. -[CHUCKLING] Thanks. Okay, well, do your stops. A lot of cops around here. -Yeah? -Mm-hmm. Okay. -Good night. -Good night. [KEYS JINGLING] [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ON PIANO] [SIGHING] Everyone clapped.

[NANCY AND DAVID TALKING INDISTINCTLY] [PIANO PLAYING SOFTLY] [MUSIC STOPS] [BACH'S PRELUDE IN C MINOR PLAYING] I don't wanna move into that shithole with him. What did you just say? You heard me. Teenage angst doesn't suit you. Do you actually think that he loves you? That's enough! -He doesn't. He's just like-- -He has a name! Use it! David is just like all the other ones, and when he dumps you, you're gonna regret doing any of this! You listen to me. When you're 18, I will be the last one stopping you from moving out. In the meantime, you're 16, stuck with me and David, so deal with it! You're a selfish bitch! I have a right to be happy, goddammit! So do I! [CRYING] [KEYS JINGLING] [EVA SOBBING] Eva?

No. It means I'll be in serious fucking shit if anybody finds out that you're here with me! But I just won't tell them. I'll make something up! Eva you can't just make shit up to the police, all right! -They'd never believe you! -How do you know? Who listens to anything that you have to say? Your mother? Her boyfriend? Fucking anyone?
