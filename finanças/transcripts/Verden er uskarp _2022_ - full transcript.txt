The almost 2.5 years I worked at the Bauhaus school - - have influenced my view of photography in a major way. I was almost shocked to discover - - that you could create your own reality as a photographer. I've always been fascinated by what light does to things. It's the light that gives shape to things. Reality isn't super sharp. I don't experience things super sharply. I experience something different with my senses instead. THE WORLD IS OUT OF FOCUS This birch has some amazing colours. And I need to give my birch a hug every time I see it. Look at all these colours here. Isn't that incredible? It's so beautiful. Here... I have to correct my hair. It's supposed to be a fun cowboy picture. Or a saloon style picture. I actually like it when things are a bit off. A bit off in a certain way. Or not quite finished. I think things can sometimes become so perfect that they end up dying. I like all the things that humans have created. Those photos wouldn't exist if people hadn't made them. This is bloody fantastic, isn't it? This is a rather good spot. This will look amazing with light passing through. When I expose it, the light will go through the holes - - and spread out as it exits. It will be amazing to use. It's just a piece of plastic junk. This is a pretty amazing spot. Look at that old log there. This looks beautiful. When I see something strange, I pick it up. I don't know what I'll use it for when I see it. I have boxes full of stuff that I can dig out when I want to make something. This is something I use a lot. When I put it into the enlarger, I can make it into any size. With these shapes, the light looks amazing when it shines through. So you don't put it on top of the photo itself. But you go through it like a negative and use it in the enlarger. Excuse me? Would you happen to have a plastic bag I could have? Yeah. Thank you! Thank you very much. I don't know why I forgot it at home. Thanks. Tada! Much easier. I got a bag! Well done, Iben. I want to look over here. It's all related to curiosity. You walk to the top of a hill - - because you don't know what's on the other side, so you have to explore. That's what my life has been like. I had to walk around that corner and see what was happening there. Or if I walk to the right, something completely different might happen. That's what you discover when you explore. You might discover something wonderful - - because you took a few extra steps to the right or left. My dad and his brothers founded Kosan Gas and named the company's vessels - - after the female members of the family. So I had a ship named Mary Else Tholstrup. I'm actually the ship's godmother. When I tell people I was born in Casablanca... That's rather unusual. 'Why were you born there?' Well, my parents were in Morocco. My dad was the Danish consul in Morocco. That's where he met my mum, who had grown up in Paris. I took that one. She spoke with a French accent her whole life. My dad was not called Lauritz. She said 'Laurice'. She was incredibly charming. There's adventure in my family's blood. I'm probably the family member who's been on the most adventures. When I was 16 I met my better half, Jan Engberg. That lasted the entirety of his long life. We were together from the age of 16. We both wanted to leave Denmark. He studied as a cabinetmaker, and I as a photographer. We wanted to get away, and we ended up going to New York. It was incredible to live in such an exciting place. There were people in the streets 24/7. You could buy food and go shopping. You could go see a movie whenever you wanted. It was in that time where you could go to Central Park - - and see Bob Dylan playing every night. You could sit and listen and eat the food you had brought. It was always busy. We bought a house shortly after. It was empty and everything had to be fixed. We did it all by ourselves and worked on it every night until 2:30 AM. Then we had breakfast and showered and were ready for work by 7 AM. It's energising. The more you do, the more you want to do. When I went to New York for the first time in the 1980s... I didn't care if a million photographers had taken pictures there before me. I found it so fascinating that the sky was cut into pieces. Because of the houses. Again, mankind that had made its mark - - and built all these gigantic houses. And all of it is so spectacular. The entire New Yorker series is much more raw than my usual photos. Photos from New York are usually glossy or in colour. I wanted it to almost look like it was drawn. There are limited shades in the paper, like photogravures. The black is absorbent, so there aren't a lot of shades within the black. That way I was able to tell my own story about New York. I found it at an exhibition in Reykjavik. I thought, 'Wow, I really want this picture!' I used this for the invitation to my 80th birthday. People found it a little bit strange. A bit morbid you could say. But I didn't think so. It actually started when my kids - - whom I had been photographing for years... In this room as well, which actually has good light - - and some nice lighting effects. When they reached school age... Once in a while I would get an idea for a picture. And when I didn't have anyone else to photograph and boss around - - all I had was myself. I call this picture 'The Domestic Goddess'. I sit there with the pot lid as my halo. I think I've always taken pictures based on - - where I was in life, so to speak. MERRY CHRISTMAS It's not that I don't like people - - but I've always enjoyed photographing cities without people. Fashion and clothes place people at a specific point in time. I wanted my photos to be timeless. I told Jan we'd go to Manhattan early in the morning, while it was empty. But it turns out Manhattan is never empty. The only way to do this is to use a pinhole. A camera obscura is a box with a hole in it. Most people use photo paper as the background and photograph on that. I wanted to do that too, but I wanted to use film instead. In the beginning I made them square or rectangular. But an eye sees a round shape, so I wanted the pinhole to do that as well. We ate oatmeal every morning, and I'd use the oatmeal boxes. I've made all my cameras out of them since then. I decided to go to 5th Avenue and stand by the church up there. There's a lot of traffic, and I wanted a shot where the people had disappeared. So I went there and took a photo and the people were gone. And that's when I got it. Whatever is standing still is captured and the rest disappears. I've shot the Tomb of the Virgin in Jerusalem. It looks like light streaming down, but it's created by people walking. It's the emptiness in the pictures that I like - - because then you see the things that are. I don't know in advance. I'll be walking through the woods and see a beautiful tree or lighting - - and feel like taking a photo. But I won't know in advance. And I don't have any use for it, I just want to capture it. I have lots of nature photos that I just took because I felt like it. I am not exactly sure what's in this suitcase. These are more nature photos. The Taj Mahal. This is a really good photo, if I may say so myself. I loved my Nikons. I could change the lenses and knew them like the back of my hand. Or my Rolleiflexes or whatever I was using. The Louisiana Museum did three archaeological exhibits. The first was about Pompeii, then Iraq, then China. I was lucky enough to be chosen as their photographer. I travelled around and took pictures for the exhibits. My cows... It makes you fall asleep. I have it by my bed. It's so peaceful. The word 'time' is always present. You could say that the time I spend - - not quite finding subjects, because they're just there... And the time spent making the picture in the darkroom - - so that it tells the story that I experienced when I took the photo - - that is all related to time. You can walk by quickly and not see it, or you can take the time to stop - - and perhaps capture something in the moment. With these things, I can spend days moving them around. At some point they'll fall into place and be just right. This is not ready yet. Something is missing. It's okay if it's artificial, but not too much. Quite often I'll actually take a photo or just a test photo in here. When I see it on the screen, I can tell what's off and should be changed. It's odd that I need to see it on a screen instead of with my eyes - - but that's how it sometimes is for me. This is a bit too nice. I don't think I want to photograph that. Too dull. I have some wings here that were provided by my cat. It's like the egg needs to be the unifying point. This is so simple that I don't need to do anything more to it. Also because of the background. That gun doesn't work here. It's better here with these. I can see myself moving these around quite a bit. I don't know. I would say this is good quality light right now. It's nice that the sun isn't shining. It's bright, it's been raining and it's of great quality. It's very transparent. It's important to me that no shadows are present. The light comes from that direction - - so this edge can cast a small shadow here. What I sometimes do is to put a small shadow along the other edges too. I can do that on the computer. Erik Christian SÃ¸rensen, he was an amazing architect, I think. He used me for all his houses, because I understood the concept - - behind how he built his houses. Here we have it again. I plan out where the tree should be - - and I make sure to come back at dusk to get that light inside the house. He meant so much to me, because he also wanted me to progress. He was the one who encouraged me to study Bauhaus - - and convinced me that this was what I had to do. I had to go to America. Bauhaus started in Germany. But then Hitler didn't like them, so they had to get out. Moholy-Nagy came from Bauhaus. He then founded the Institute of Design in Chicago. They made industrial design. Things that were meant to be used. That's how it started in Germany by Walter Gropius. I was 22 when I got there. I'm the third person from the right. Our teacher, the second person from the left, was Aaron Siskind. A rather well-known American photographer. AN ACADEMY FOR YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHERS When I came to Chicago I was a trained photographer. I knew the craft and how to copy photos. That's how you could see that I was a professional photographer. I got scholarships and did exhibitions for example. We're showing some of her student work for the very first time - - since she showed them in Chicago in 1951-52. Whatever I have seen from Else - - is way above normal standards. She is very aware that only the best is good enough. I do believe that if Else would have stood up and promoted her own work - - she would be a very well-known photographer nowadays. And it's a crying shame. It's not just photography, but also how to use the photo. I've made a book on that called A Game in City Streets - - which features children playing in the street. I take photos, and then I draw the backgrounds where they play. That was how we worked at the school in Chicago. In Chicago, I lived on 17 East Elm Street. I lived with Ati Gropius and her husband. Every time Ati's father, Walter Gropius, visited - - we would have dinners together, and we became one big family. I probably wasn't aware of how famous they were at the time - - but I found out later on. I was lucky enough to get to work - - for the well-known photographer Arthur Siegel. He had previously taught photography at the school. He saw my photos at that exhibition - - and asked me to come along to help him copy his photos. I came along for a lot of his shoots. I took portraits of Frank Lloyd Wright while Arthur Siegel did other things. But it was Siegel's commission, so the negatives all belonged to him. I wasn't credited. I was just thrilled to be there. To get to do it, and to be in the darkroom. Which I was good at. Then I had to find a job, which wasn't easy, as they wouldn't hire women. Women didn't belong in commercial photography. Then I found a man named David Langley - - who was a big name in commercial photography. He had an impressively large studio - - and people were running around as if an accident had happened. They didn't have time for me because something terrible had happened. They had been on a shoot and when they came back - - the assistant had developed all the pictures in one tub and left for lunch. Then someone had set the water to boil, so all the film had melted. I said I could fix it for them, if they got me some hardener. He asked me what hardener was, and I sent him to a photography shop. I told them to get a lot of bags and bring them to me so I could fix it. He went, 'Good Lord, it's working!' And I said, 'I told you!' 'Why doesn't anyone else know?' 'Because you weren't trained in Denmark.' He said, 'I'd like to talk to you. Can you stay until this is sorted?' Then he said, 'I know just the right person for you.' Then he called J. Frederick Smith who asked him to send me over at once. I noticed charming Fred the moment I stepped in. We clicked immediately. You also need luck. I went to work for Fred, who didn't know about technical stuff. He was an illustrator. In the old days they used illustrations instead of photos of clothes. Ads were illustrations rather than photos. He needed someone who knew what she was doing, so he gave me a job. And he said, 'Marianne, I'm giving you all the still lifes.' 'You can't tell anyone, and it has to be in my name.' 'But I'll pay you $1000 per photo.' 1000 dollars! I came from 8 dollars a month in Denmark. We'll be millionaires before we've even started. We really lived the dream of coming to America and making it. I worked with Fred Smith for eight years. We had an amazing time together. We travelled the world and took pictures. I was the one who set up the light and did everything. But none of it had my name on it. Fred said he was the photographer. People would tell me I was copying Fred. No one believed it was my technique. Fred's name was on everything. I call this, 'The Young Girl's Dream of Marriage.' That's the dream, and that's reality. For this one I needed two enlargers. I exposed the background first and covered this. Then I used another enlarger, covered the background and exposed this. It was rather laborious. This is the last picture that was ever taken of the whole family. Before my father died in a car crash. This is my mother. She died from a brain tumour 1.5 years after my father had died. This is perhaps the most symbolic, because I am looking straight ahead. And the knife is right above her head. I didn't know that my parents would die shortly after that photo was taken. This is my Icelandic grandmother. That's my Danish grandmother. My Icelandic family wanted my brother and me to go live in Iceland. So I grew up and lived in Iceland until I was 20 years old. This is a photo my father took of my mother. His shadow falls on her in such a beautiful way. Let's see if it works. LARS SCHWANDER Muse, photographer and assistant You can speak up a little bit, Tove. When they sit down in front of a camera - - it's sometimes crucial for me to... first of all strip off that social friendliness toward the camera. People become very socially friendly when they sit in front of a camera. Perhaps we're scared of the sides we don't like about ourselves. That they become visible too soon. Do you think it's different when you're photographed by a family member - - compared to having your portrait taken by someone else? I think families have some very rigid roles and patterns. And it's very rare that we break out of those - - when we're with our family. Aren't you more rigid with a stranger? On the contrary. I think you have more trust in a stranger - - you don't have to wake up next to and live with - - for the next many, many years. Is the camera the essential thing when taking portraits? Yes, I'd say so. It's a tool you need to know like the back of your hand. If you don't, you deprive yourself of that great contact you can have - - with the subject, because you'll be thinking about your camera. Where to press, how to focus, etc. You must be perfectly comfortable with your camera. It's a tool, much like it would be for a violinist or a guitarist. Yes. Do you prefer that people forget about the camera? Yes, I prefer that. Because otherwise it becomes - - the person's relationship with the camera - - that determines the picture. And I don't think that the camera is... good enough at getting the right things to come out. They don't have a role when they arrive. They're lost. - They don't have any roles? - They need to set them aside in a way. Because this is my domain. I'm the one who acts almost like a lion tamer. I can crack the whip whichever way I like. You look like you belong in the wild. I can see it in your eyes. You really have... They're like rocky cliffs. - Did you grow up in nature? - Well, Oslo. I guess that's a bit... I wouldn't mind making you wet, perhaps. Your hair. Could you take it off? I would bring some water in, then. Not now though. Because I think it would look great if your body was a bit wet. And that we could see the water on your face and body. That would tie it together. Black and white have a powerful effect. That looks good with your hair and beard that sort of go that way. Doesn't he look good? I think so too. If you're wearing that coat, you should use it. That's it, because then we can use the hands. Think Hollywood. Face too. Wow. Isn't she beautiful? Try looking past me. Into nothingness, into eternity. That's it. The eyelashes look good here as well. Isn't that a beautiful mouth? Like a heart. Try opening it up just a little bit. Yes, it looks softer and larger. Try using your other hand to move your hair around. - Like that? - Oh yes. Great. Yes, just like that. Shouldn't she be a model? Maybe you are? No? Okay. Then I decided to leave Fred. Everyone told me I was crazy, and I thought they might be right. I found a lovely penthouse with two roofs - - where I could take photos with amazing light. So I signed the contract and took it. And then I opened my own studio. It went surprisingly well, because one thing I was good at was lighting. The first job I landed was for Steuben Glass. No one sat light better than me, so four days a week - - I did all their glassware. That meant I could pay the rent for my apartment and studio. That was nice with just one client. All the rest came along eventually. But I found it exciting to set the light on glassware. A village on the island of Ceylon in the Indian Ocean. Laterna Film had asked me to do a few five-minute children's programmes. So I decided to dive into that. I ended up on Ceylon with all my cameras. I had a chauffeur who drove me around because I had so much equipment. He could watch out for me too, as I went into the jungle as a young woman. I was in my mid-twenties. I can still remember his voice as he turned to me and said: 'Missy, you must be born at the end of June.' Excuse me? How did he know I was born in late June? Then he said that after driving me around for three days - - he could sense that I was born in late June. He told me quite a few other things. Apparently he was psychic. Then I asked him, 'What about love?' I was single at the time, no boyfriend. And I figured that I had to meet a nice man at some point. And then he said, 'Ah, he's just around the corner.' Then one day as I was coming home from my shoot, I ran into a film crew. They were shooting The Bridge on the River Kwai. They just stared as I lugged my cameras and equipment around. They had no idea where I had come from. I was invited for drinks at the hotel where we all happened to be staying. They all found it interesting that I was also a photographer - - because they needed someone to take behind-the-scenes photos for them. Alec Guinness had the lead role. He and I became great friends. He told some great stories. All my photos went straight to America where they replied: 'Let her stay, the photos look good.' I never saw them myself. That's Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa. These are from The Bridge on the River Kwai. They look so tiny on this machine. I find it really difficult... to put this into words. These are the actors, but... I'd hate to attach my name to something if I'm unsure. I thought the cinema operator was rather sweet. I wondered if he was the man my chauffeur had talked about. His name was Peter. So... I had a romance with Peter. In the evenings, Peter and William Holden would play drums. And that inspired me to take drum lessons in the village. And I bought two drums so I could play with them. We brought the drums back to Denmark. Peter and I would sit on my parents' terrace and play our drums. I had learnt some beats. I still remember one of them. Here it comes... And you'd play several drums. We had a lot of fun with that. I spent six months on the film. Then Peter and I travelled through India up to Kashmir. A lot of the pictures of me are some I've taken myself - - with the camera on a tripod and a self-timer. And then I'd run to my position. I didn't always make it, but I did make it onto the elephant. Then he went back to London, where he was from. You can't see it, it's miniscule. See? That's the hole people will pay a lot of money to know the size of. It all started when I arrived in 1963. And I didn't have that hole until 1971. It took that long to make the perfect hole. Thousands of holes to get it right. How do your pictures come into being? You also crop them? In the darkroom, I want to have the option - - to use the space that surrounds the person - - in the way that I feel it should be incorporated - - in terms of the direction of the gaze, movement or light. Would you find any satisfaction in cropping when exposing? No, it would be dull to go into the darkroom - - if my process had been completed during the shoot. Then I may as well hire someone to develop the pictures in the darkroom. There's something in me that tells me the picture has to be a certain way. Because otherwise it doesn't fall into place. You can see it and then you walk around and read the light. When I take a pinhole, I read from my hand. It takes practice. You have exposures that take - - from 17 minutes and up to three hours, which has been the longest. The picture I like from the staircase had a 1.5-hour exposure. I feel it in my gut when it's right. Some pictures just don't reach me, and then I must change them. Some photos are just right. I only do one picture of each thing. But to get to that picture, I might do ten versions - - to find the one that it should be. It's not just one picture, but the last one is the best one - - within that series of ten. It's a long, almost alchemistic process - - when you're in the darkroom working with pictures. And you're just alone in the dark with the red lamps. Perhaps with a bit of music which might have some sort of effect. You're very isolated when you're making pictures in the dark. What I normally do is to over-expose and over-develop - - to make the pictures look as grainy as possible. I was very happy to leave the darkroom. I thought 30 years in the dark had to be enough. When I learned to work digitally - - it was actually a big relief to not have to go into the darkroom. I don't have a darkroom anymore, and I don't miss it. Standing over those chemicals definitely takes its toll. They are more or less poisonous chemicals. There's no escaping that. It suits me at this age to sit here and make my pictures. These cabbage girls are adorable. Just look at their clogs. I do one almost every day, but they don't always turn out very well. I had done it one way first and it looked completely idiotic. That picture was much too nice. It should be like this. When you travel the world, you need to travel light. It's just cardboard, so it's very light. You can see that it's made in such a way - - that my assistant could place it without knowing what was what. I'd ask for 'box B' and it would show here and also on the box itself. You had the problem during the shoot that when you open here - - the sun would shine into it, and then you couldn't get a picture. So I made a lens hood - - which is just a half tube like this that I put on. Then I could push it back and forth until the light didn't hit the hole. I've always been fascinated by the south. Columns, heat, palm trees and all that. To begin with I travelled to Italy and Greece a lot. Also for this series, which was exhibited at Art Museum Brandts. It was beauty that I wanted to capture. Because that was what I found on Acropolis and in Rome. My idea was that I somehow wanted to show - - how architecture had been fascinated by nature. Like how a column could look like a palm tree. With the crown of the tree on top, etc. I don't have a fixed idea when I travel. It happens when I'm there. Then I start to gather impressions, almost like sketches. They aren't finished photos. Tobias Faber, Rector of the Academy of Fine Arts, asked - - if I wanted to come work at the Academy. So I became a secretary to Tyge Arnfred. The professors were men. And the teachers were men. The secretarial workers were primarily women. I had to change from the photographer's union to another union for that job. People were aware that I had other talents than secretarial work - - which I didn't have a talent for. I moved my entire darkroom to the Academy. I taught the foundational courses, and we took pictures of Copenhagen - - and I taught them about developing and exhibiting. That was in fact my function. And when the various rectors were to be photographed - - so they could be hung like the prime misters in Parliament - - I was the one who took their portraits. The portraits of the rectors were done by me. I thought it was amazing to do - - but I was only paid as a secretary. I don't know why I put up with all that. But I did. People say, 'It must be exciting to photograph something unexpected.' And I say, 'No, no, no.' I know exactly what I get. What you don't see is what's inside the box. So now I don't see that. Now I want some more, so I step back. You get used to holding it at different distances. What you don't see is what you get. - I don't want to be in your way. - I'm filming you. Oh, okay. In the meantime I met my husband, whom I married before long. We were looking through our diaries. And the man who I had married had been in India - - and had travelled to Ceylon to attend some lectures. And that had happened right by the bridge we built for the film. And we had been there on exactly the same days at the same place. Just like my chauffeur had predicted - - the person I would marry was just around the corner. Several years had passed, and it was him all along. I've been married twice, and I have three kids. I'm almost done living in AllerÃ¸d. I've lived here for almost 63 years, I believe. I've wanted to try living in Copenhagen for a long time. I finally went through with it and got a lovely flat. I've chosen to take all my pictures with me. I'm in my new flat which I am so happy with. I look forward to unpacking and setting up my workspace - - and getting back into making photos. The most important thing for me - - was to be able to continue taking photos and exhibiting. And to just keep working. I wonder what these are used for. This is the best angle. It looks like an old temple. It's very sort of... It's very masculine, if I'm allowed to say that. It looks quite forceful. Almost brutal. Wow, this is gorgeous. I like things that are large and powerful. I got to know Richard Winther through mutual friends. When he heard I was a photographer, he wanted me to work with him. That's what we did in the early and mid-1970s. He very much wanted to be photographed, which comes across. He's right in his element. Photographers don't usually work together. There's always the photographer and the assistants. The photographer works with the model. That's where the collaboration happens. It's not with other photographers. We were just the two of us, so we were able to make these tableaus. We were the subjects. It was a very good collaboration. If photos were taken with his camera, he developed the film and made the copy. Only rarely would he reluctantly give me one - - even though I had helped make them. I was a bit cross about that. I wrote him a letter where I asked him to give me - - the series called 'The Milk Maid'. That made him very, very angry. I thought it was odd that he didn't want to give me that. Then he came to visit and gave me this painting. I was very grateful for that. Then he asked me if I could see what it was. I said, 'Yes, it looks like someone is stirring or cooking something there.' 'And that's the painter.' 'Yes, that's it.' 'And that's you, always stirring the cooking pots.' 'And those are the big visions flying over your head.' This one is quite humorous. Here he is reading with his glasses on - - while the lion is busy fornicating with the girl. That's a fun one. Danish light is very different from American light. I still believe that the reason I'm so fascinated by light - - is because in the bedroom that I shared with my sister - - we had one of those big skylights. You could see the sky and the clouds and watch the world getting darker. I've always been fascinated by what light does to things. It's the light that gives shape to things. I read the light with my eyes. That's why I like the pinhole camera. I can build the light. Layer, by layer, by layer. I wanted to organise my archives and decided to give away everything - - to those who might be interested. What should I do with these? No one would be interested. I don't photograph anymore, but when others do, I can't resist giving advice: 'If you stand further to the left, it will look completely different.' These are for an exhibit at Esbjerg Library. Your job is to help me select the ones you think are suitable. I know this is usually Tove Kurtzweil's job. It's sad that she can't be here any longer. Yes, it's sad that she can't be here, but it's good of you to fill her shoes. At an exhibit in Iceland, someone said: 'Wow, that almost looks like an erotic scene with the male approaching.' I hadn't thought of that myself. When I started photographing fish - - they always looked like food, no matter what I did. So I had to place them somewhere you never see fish. I don't like that. We'll have to arrange it in a different way. We could put those on top of each other. - Like this, right? - Yes, let's do that. So it's those two and these four. I wasn't sure about these ones, but when we put them in the middle... That's what I thought. You created this midline. Yes, and the reason for that is that this top height - - is actually parallel to the top height of those four pieces. This is just so I can remember the order. - Hello, Nanna! It's been so long. - It has. You look exactly the same. So do you. I recognised you straight away. I think we should give three cheers for this great adventurer. Well, actually we'll be giving 90 cheers. I'm going to yell, 'hur!' and you'll yell, 'rah!' - Okay. - Got it? Huuuuuuuurraaaaaaah! Huuuuuuuurraaaaaaah! Wow, look at this... 'New acquisitions.' Here it is. - Thanks to Banja... - No... Yes, it most certainly is. I can now stand next to my name. I'd look out of those tall windows at the lake and say: 'Whatever happens, I want to exhibit here someday.' How incredible that it came true. Here. Slow down. Wow, look at this. This is incredible. What an amazing spot. It's completely unreal. What a strange feeling to have my art displayed here. After wanting it for so many years. I believed in it, and then I stopped believing in it, but I kept going. This is just incredible. It couldn't be any better than this. I've thought about going back and making some of the pinhole pictures - - to see what I would do with them today. Reality isn't super sharp. I don't experience things super sharply. I experience something different with my senses instead. In memory of Tove Kurzweil 1938-2018 Thousands of women were pioneers in fine art photography - - and kept taking pictures throughout their long lives. A few became famous, but most of them are still waiting to be discovered. This film is dedicated to them. Subtitles: Sara SjÃ¶lin Oneliner
