You need something to eat. - Hunger's the cause of your headache. - i don't want anything. - Have some bread. - Could i just have an aspirin? i'm not going to give you anything bad. Here. - Sit down. i'll massage your head. -That never works for me. it will if i do it. i don't like strangers touching me. - May i ask you something? -Yes. What does Brand want? i'm not discussing him with you. - Do you hate me? - No. -Then we can talk frankly, can't we? -What for? -To get rid of the tension between us. -Tension? -You know what i mean. -There is no tension. i only want to clear the air. Bitch. Stupid, two-faced bitch! Don't underestimate me. i could put a curse on you. i won't though. i'll do something else. i'll encourage you. - Let's see if you can get Brand. - i'm leaving. Lean over him when he's writing in his notebook. Show him your ass! Lena. i'll be friendly again tomorrow. "Ha-ha," laughs Nico. "What a joke." Very good. See you Monday. Lena, wait a minute. Do you like it? Do you like it? What do you want? - i want you to wear it. - is that Kate's dress? - it does n't fit her anymore. - i can't. - You would n't wear it around here. - What good is it if i wear it at home? - You want to see me in it, don't you? - Yes. Put it back. it's out of the question. - Wear it to church. - To church? i never go to church. i'm not religious. Neither am i, but we're going this Sunday. -What about Kate? - She does n't go to church. Oh, Brand, i'd like to. - But i'm scared. - Kate doesn't need to know. - Some other place. - No. - Why not? - We can't. Only in church. - Here. Sunday, the 1 1 :00 Mass. - i don't want to. Please. i don't want to. But we do have a date. Perfect. We'll continue Monday. - We just finished. - is he doing his best? Yes. See you Sunday. Hang on, Lena. i've got something for you. - Do you like it? - You're giving her that dress? - Yes. - it's my favorite. An old dress that doesn't fit me anymore? - i look at it sometimes. - What's wrong? - i slaughtered a goat for that dress. - Yeah, right. Here, Lena. it's yours. Thank you. You don't think i think you fancy her, do you? No. - i'm not in the mood. - Well, get in the mood then. - i have to get up. - Why? - To buy paint for the gnome. - it's Easter. i'll get some round the back at Bleeker's. it's Easter. - i've hidden eggs. - i'm going to Bleeker's first. Holy Father, Almighty and eternal God, to do justice to Your grace, to receive Your healing hand, we thank You, in eternity. Because when we fast You will keep us from evil, You will guide our minds to You, You will make us virtuous and You give us - What color do you need? Blue. - Dark blue or light blue? - Light blue. And yellow. Dark yellow. Warm. Pretty warm. - There's nothing here. - i said, "Pretty warm." i didn't say, "Hot." Warm. Warm, warm. Warm. Warm. Hot. Hot. Very hot. Hot. Cold. Cold. Cold! Get your notebook. Dictation. - Again? - Yes. "Have you paid your subscription?" the treasurer asked Wim. Subscription? - "Yes," Wim lied. - Not so fast. The treasurer gave him a supercilious look. Supercilious? isn't that too hard for me? "just kidding," said Wim, and lookout his alligator-skin wallet. Alligator-skin? Come on, Lena. The treasurer gazed at the kaleidoscopic gouache on the wall. Kaleido - What's wrong? Nothing. i'm tutoring. - You're tormenting me. - He opened his galvanized cash box- You're tormenting me! What's wrong with you? i was in church, because we had a date. Kate messed it up. Fool that i am, i was in church. Church. What a word to come home to. One of these days, i'm going to get that bastard Stornebrink. - With his stupid jokes. - Kate, sweetheart. Brand, darling. Let's have a nice cozy evening. Eat some fish. Watch TV together. We'll do all of that. Why don't we ask Lena to stay? i don't have enough food in the house, that's why. it's okay. Kate's okay with it. Please. - it's good, Kate. - What? - This custard. - it's just out of the bottle. A man's moved into that house. - Which house? - That empty house. - What kind of man? -just a man. Knowledgeable. Nice voice. - A radio voice. - Knowledgeable? - Yes. He's coming by tomorrow. - No, he's not. i don't want him here, with his radio voice. Then he's not coming. - i'm leaving. - We haven't finished yet. Do you want to be my whore? Everything settled and aboveboard? i'll pay you. - Have you been saying funny things? - No. - Why is she crying? - How should i know? She just starts crying like that? - She's from the city. - So? They cry more easily. i have to act like this. You know that, don't you? Can't you talk or something? Did you try that dress on? Not to me. To each other. i LOVE YOU i'm feeling better now. Coffee and cake. No hard feelings. i'm imagining things. Brand's a jerk. it's not him. it's things at home. - What's wrong at home? - Let's not talk about that. Lena is a tutor. A tutor should not have a background. Don't be silly. i'm interested in Lena. Not when i'm around. She's the tutor. Everything you know about her, you hear from me. You invited her for dinner. i enjoy it. "i enjoy it." That's not what you said in the kitchen. One has to make conversation with dinner guests. Yes, about the weather. But she's crying because she's having a hard time at home. Should i just ignore that? - Lena, finish your coffee and leave. - Stay put. She can stay here all day. - She can cook for us. - What? - You heard me. - No. No way. - Can you cook? - Never! You've got no say. i work, you don't. - What are you up to? - Think it over, Lena. You've got Stornebrink. Lena is mine. Bitch! - Where are you going to sit? - By the "Z." Hello. i was out for a spin. - What are you fishing for? - Fish. i'm off. See you tomorrow. - A secret date? - i just happened to drive by. - i brought some rolls. Want some? - No, thanks. - With brawn. - No, thanks. One for the road? You'd like to stick it in her, huh? But you don't have the guts. - Why don't you? - Shut up. i know what you'll whisper in her ear. i don't want to talk about it. -Any other man would have done it ages ago. - Shut up! i don't want to talk about it! -Are you offended? - i'm taking a dump. i don't want to talk about it. i don't even want you to entertain the idea. You should be happy i entertain the idea. - i'm very happy. - i'm setting you free, idiot! Don't think i'm under your influence. Fat fairy! Brand, darling. Come on. -join me. - With shit on my ass? i'll lick it off, if you like. Save the seductive talk. it doesn't make me horny. Just wipe your ass and join me. What now? You're in love with Lena. - No. - You are. You want to have her. it's hopeless. i don't want to. i love you. Grab her. Take her. Free yourself. What kind of game is this? Be jealous. i am jealous, but i want a man with only one woman on his mind. Kate. This conversation doesn't count. it's late. i don't fancy Lena at all. - Where are you going? - To the gnome. Stop it. She doesn't want me. - i'm married. - You're my brother. Your brother? if you get horny, you're my brother. You understand? - That'll make it easier for her. - i'm your husband. it would be adultery. if you get horny, you're my brother. Do you want to get rid of me? it's that man in the empty house, with his radio voice. Don't make it so complicated. Be my brother. Are you coming? On the slide. Slide. Bob wants a go on the slide too. Bob wants a go on the slide too. Do you love Kate? Yes. What do you want then? Oh, Lena. A breast. One breast. Come closer. Could i have a glass of water? - You want a glass of milk? - i'd rather have water. - i have some custard left. - No, thanks. i'm thirsty. - i'd rather have water. - Buttermilk? - Good for the intestines. - That's not true. - So what do you want? - Water. So, Lena, have you thought it over? - Yes. - And? i'm not sure. i'd like it. And so would my brother. - Brand is my brother. - Brother? it was a game. What was a game? We were posing as a couple. But why? - it was Brand's idea. - What? At the start, remember? You said, "A young girl might feel awkward alone with a bachelor." So i said, "Let's be a married couple then. For a joke." it took on a life of its own. - i think it's weird. - A game. - Why so well acted? - Well acted? Brand told me things about you that he didn't have to tell me. And he told them as a husband, not as a brother. All part of the game. What now? Well, this might change things, don't you think? - Change things? - in our relationships. Everything's clear. Crystal clear. it's odd. First you're a couple, and then you're suddenly brother and sister. Why are you carrying on like that? Just see us as children, and the whole issue is solved. Just forget everything up till now. You're Lena, this is Brand and i'm his little sister. Sandwich? i'll make you a nice one. - No kidneys. - No kidneys. - And no brawn either. - No brawn either. The sandwich will have to wait. You have to go, Kate. it's my lesson time. - Go where? - Shopping. - That's your job. - Forget everything up till now. - Everything up till now is forgotten. - Not everything. - What do you mean? - You have to remember some things. Like what? Your breast. That you showed it to me. - i've forgotten. - Show me the other one. i don't want you, Brand. i don't want you. - We've come this far. - i've nothing more to say. Damn it, Lena. Don't torment me. - i can't go back. - Say you love me then. You think you can get me just like that? it's all sorted out now, right? i love you. i was born to be with you. - Kate approves. She wants it. - What does Kate want? - For us to be happy. - What does Kate want? Kate isn't important. There's a caravan in here. - We can fuck there. - No! Don't you want me? What do you want? jewelry? - i've got to go. - Why? i have a date. i'm going out for a beer in the city. - Who with? - Friends. Young guys you can have a laugh with. Tell me that it's just going to fast. That i just have to slow down. -That everything will be all right. - i really have to go. Do you want me or not? Control yourself. i don't want you anymore. Bitch! - "i" before "E" except after "C". - Fine. - Brand. - i'm not in the mood for rhymes. "i" before "E" is a useful rhyme. - You're merciless. - What do you mean? Why are you wearing that dress after what happened yesterday? - it was the only - - Did you learn that behavior in college? - What behavior? - You're just like my dad. Took me to the fair, but never opened his wallet. Little Brand could just ogle. The weather's nice. - Shall we go outside? - And then? - A walk. - And then you'll flash your pussy. Look, Brand, my pussy. No, don't touch it. Brand can't touch. Brand can ogle! We can have a pancake in the caf?. i'd rather do "i" before "E". About yesterday - Kicking me when i'm down? Beer. Young guys. - Did you have a laugh? - Yes, i had a laugh. it doesn't matter, Lena. To me you're just a twit. Like all the others. Two tits. Generous Lena. i'm your woman, Brand. Say you're bored stiff by those young guys. Those young guys bore me stiff. Kiss. - Brand, are you coming? - He'll be right there. The beaver doesn't allow any intruders into his territory. Only during mating season can the female beaver- - Why do you look at me like that? - How? Like a poodle. You're looking at me like a poodle. i feel like one, forced to mate with a selected female. - Poor you. - i'll fall in love with Lena. - Liar. You're already in love! - Stop me then. No, your love is fresh. i want it to rot. Are you coming? What did you just say? - Nauseating. - it won't be much longer, sweetheart. - i love you. - Right. Go on. Quiet down! Sister can't sleep! - Lena's cooking today. - My favorite dish, please. What? - Horse meat sausages. - i don't like that. You don't know that, because you've never had it. i don't eat horse meat. Lena ate your brawn. - That hasn't got horse meat in it. -just try it. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - Do i have to say funny things? - No. What things? - About the past. - You don't know anything. - i know everything. - You were at boarding school. - Boarding school? - Yes. i was home on the weekends. - But i wasn't. - Why not? - i stayed with friends. - What friends? All right. Kate's talking about the past. i'm going inside. - We were going to ask her something. - it can wait. No, now. - it can wait. - Those kind of questions can't wait. -You wanted to ask me something? -Yes. We shouldn't have to sleep in the small bed. -Why not? -Well, there's two of us. You've got that big bed all to yourself. it doesn't seem fair. You're banishing me to the spare room? if you want to put it like that. - Should i answer right now? - Yes. No. - i told you. - Why are you asking then? i don't agree. This is Brand's house, not yours. Be quiet, girl! You're a guest. Brand asks the questions here. i'm going to take a dump on your toilet. May i? - What? -join me. You made me into your brother. i'll decide when you're my wife again. -What is it? -Are you deaf? i want Brand. - Can't it wait? - No. -We want to sleep. - i want to sleep too. -With my brother. - Brand and i are a couple. You're not just a sister. You're a woman too. There's a man for you. Somewhere. Don't speak to me like that. - No. - Come here! Brand isn't his sister's slave. i still count for something around here. No! Good night. - What is it? - Please,join me. - i'm your wife. - Come on. i've been sharing your bed for 20 years. That's over now, i know that. -just one more night. - Please, Kate. - i yearn for you. - it's impossible. i want it. - Can i? - Don't you dare. - Kate is lonely. - Don't you dare! Damn you! Hag! - Where are you going? - Away. You don't even try to stop me. Jerk! - Do you still love me? - What kind of person must i be? - Do you still love me? - i almost love Lena more. As long as it stays almost. it won't. She'll win. What's this all about? i want a child. - A child? -Yes, from you and Lena. i knew it was leading to this. A child. -Yes, a child. - Moron! -A child for the two of us. - Noway. -We had a vision once. -You had a vision. Tons of visions. We were going to live in the mountains. We've never even been to a mountain. We were going to open an amusement park. All we have is one seesaw. - illusions. - A child is no illusion. Lena doesn't even want a child. Come here. Come here, Brand. We're going to play a scene tomorrow. Demand the big bed. Humiliate me. Show Lena who's the boss around here. i know her type. She wants to be impregnated. By authority. Damn it, Lena! Help me. Come on, Lena. - it's over. - No, it's not. You're under your sister's spell. You're a new girl and Kate is an old girl. Girl? - A sister, but also a girl. - So? - Don't you understand? - No. Your ways are foreign to me. Why should a brother have to sleep with his sister if he has a girlfriend? - See it as an old Indian custom. - See you as children, see you as Indians. i'm not an anthropologist. - Do you love me? -Yes, but i'm leaving. - But why? - Because i don't get what i want. -What do you want? -The big bed. And i want Kate to be civil with me. - Do you want me? - Yes. Then i'll be the lady of the house. Kate is moving to the spare room. We're eating horse meat for dinner today. And Kate is eating it too. - What are you doing? - Cooking lamb. - That's not necessary. - Why not? Put the lamb back in the freezer. We're eating something else. - What? - No back talk. Horse meat sausages. Eat what you want, i'm eating lamb. You're eating horse meat sausages. You're assholes, the both of you. Assholes! Lena and i are sleeping in the big bed. You've been manipulating him again, bitch. And you're sleeping in the spare room for the rest of your life. And words like asshole and bitch are not to be uttered. Especially not to Lena. You're going to tell me what i can and cannot say? - Yes. - Any other words i can't use? Any other words you'd rather not hear from Kate's mouth? - Hag and brawn. - Hag and brawn. Asshole, bitch, hag, brawn. Asshole, bitch, hag, brawn. - Asshole, bitch - - On your knees. - Asshole, bitch - - See that girl? That's Lena. The girl i've been looking for my entire life. See how beautiful she is? - You don't hold a candle to her. - Stop it. - Apologize to Lena. - What for? - For your hostile attitude. - Let me go and keep your mouth shut. - Say, "i'm sorry." - That's enough. - i'll hit you! Say you're sorry. - Stop it, Brand! - Say it, you cow! - Stop it. - We've got to stay normal. - Oh, normal? Yes, please. Nice scene, eh? My father called horse meat unhappy meat. i'm pregnant. For a while already. -jeez, Lena. - A baby. is that what you want? Jesus, Kate. - You'll be an aunt. - Godmother. Give your sister-in-law a kiss. - it's going to be a boy. - Really? - Yes. Can i think of a name? - That's weird. - Kate has eaten horse meat. - So? - She's made a gesture. - Tony. - Tony? - Yes, Tony. Tony. Little Tony, that'll be his name. Who's a happy boy then? Yes. Who's a - - Darling? - Yes? - Can you do me a favor? - Sure. Could you fix the old seesaw behind the barn for Tony? Of course. What's all this then? Look, cowboys. Bang, bang. Hey, what's that? What's that? That's a hole to peep through. To look at the grown-ups. What's that then? What's that? A tickle hand, eh? You're my lovely little man, aren't you? - Time for his bottle. - Let's go for a walk. Time for his bottle! What's that then, eh? That's a gnome. He lives in the garden. What's he doing? Catching little fish. Yes. Look. Here comes the little fish it's time for his bottle. And who's that? That's daddy. Sweet daddy. And who's that? Lena. Lena? Mommy. - Have you told her yet? - What? - That we're looking for a house. - No. - We're looking for a house. - in the city. There's one buyer ahead of us, but he hasn't made up his mind. Does little Tony have to grow up in the city? - Yes, why not? - So he can't tell a cow from a horse? - He'll learn that at school. - He's got space here. - Clean air, a seesaw. - There are parks in the city. And child molesters. Child molesters? Don't be silly. Kate doesn't know anything about the city. The city is rife with panic and suspicion. - As if it's safe here. - What do you mean? The man from the empty house, i wouldn't trust him with my child. - Don't be silly. - i agree with Lena. That man's no good. Something's wrong. - intuition. - You haven't got any. Nor has she. - And Kate does, i suppose? - Don't "Kate" me. Say "you!" - You! - Stop it! Must little Tony grow up with two witches? - So, you're moving to the city? - Yes. Brand? Yes. - But i'm not in any hurry, Lena. - i am. What are you going to do? Make soup. - Against a rising depression. - Not onion soup. The man from the empty house is leaving. Leaving? Emigrating. To Australia. Let me go. How's it going? Hello, little one. is that you? Are you hungry then? Come here. Come here. - Brand? -Yes. -What time is Lena coming home? -What time is it now? - 1 2:30. -Around 3:00. Yes, that's nice, isn't it? What are you doing? isn't it obvious? i'm breast-feeding Tony. - Greedy little thing. -You can't do this. i'm doing it. My God! - Give me that baby. - He was hungry. - How dare you! - He was hungry! Then give him his bottle. -That's fake. -That tit of yours is fake. Letting little Tony suck on an empty breast. The empty breast of a strange woman. - i'm not a strange woman to Tony. - You've got no milk! You've got no milk. You're an inadequate mother. i'm helping you. Brand, back me up, please. Kate, stop it. i've got milk, Lena. - Did you know about this? - No. You just stand there, do you? You're not shocked when your mad sister breast-feeds our baby? i am. When little Tony gets a big, fat cow tit shoved in his little face? - i am. - Say something. Say what you think. i'm not saying or thinking one more thing. Do you think Kate should be allowed to breast-feed our baby? Yes or no? Yes or no? See Kate as a wet nurse. A wet nurse with good intentions. You don't want one? Fine, she won't do it anymore. - Problem solved. - Do you hear that, Lena? Problem solved. Do you know how i see Kate? As a sick sow. i don't even see you. i only smell you, because you stink. Of you! Everything stinks of you. How dare you speak to me like that, you useless creature! Any news about the house? Any news about the house? Would you answer Kate, Lena? No. Peace. is that too much to ask? Peace, what's that? Answering each other, that's all. i'm sick. - That man hasn't made up his mind yet. - He'll say no. - Oryes. - We're buying that house. if not, we'll find another one. - You want some? - That's not good for Tony. - it's porridge. - With bran in it. - So? - He can't digest that yet. - i've never heard that before. - Me neither. But i have. - What is it? - i don't know. A pain in my stomach. - What's in that porridge? - What are you talking about? - What's in that porridge? - What do you think? Poison! Dirty rat! You're making my sweetheart sick. Sick? i don't do things half-assed. Jesus, what are you up to? - i'm getting us our lives back. - Oh, that's how we do it? - Lena's troublesome. Let's kill her? - i don't do it lightly. - Bitch! - Lena is nothing. A useless creature. That's what she is, isn't she? You know who i am? Brand. Lena's husband. - Where are you going? -To Lena. i love her, Kate. Can't you get that through your thick skull? i'm the one you love. You had forgotten it for a while, but now you remember. i did love you once, but you've turned into a bad person. What possesses you? it's not about Lena. it's little Tony. He shouldn't be with her. He's ours. That was the whole idea. Don't be scared. Surpass yourself for once. Leave it to me. Just watch and think nothing. How does one do that? Think nothing? i'll be the old Kate again. Your sweetheart. i love you, Brand. You're my beloved. How is Lena going to die? Slowly? Painfully? Damn it, Kate. is it really necessary? Come and have a look. Tony's being so sweet. We're coming. Just think nothing. There's a moving van in front of the empty house. Don't you want to say good-bye? - No. - Why not, Kate? Because. isn't that something for us, that empty house? - No, Lena. - Why not? We'll talk when you're better. What's that? - Broth for Lena. - No broth. - She has to eat. - i'll make her something. Make it hard on yourself. Lena, dear. i'm so sick. You must eat something. You'll be better tomorrow. A cracker with margarine. - it's horrible. - No wonder. it's from before the war. - i'll make something else. - i'll make something else. - i will make something else. -You know nothing about food. You can fish a herring out of a jar. That's all. - Do you want some toast? - i want something hot. i've got some leftover cabbage. No. - i could warm it up. - No. A kipper? With rice pudding. - i'm allergic to rice. - i've got lovely apples. - An apple? - Grated. - With what in it? - Cinnamon. i don't want this, Kate. An apple isn't hot, is it? A horse meat sausage? There's one in the fridge. i threw it away. it was moldy. - What do you want? - You decide what's good for me. - Are you sure you want to eat? - Porridge, that's best. Best? What do you know about sick people? What's wrong? Why isn't she allowed to eat? Do you want to keep her sick? Does she turn you on like that? - You microbe! - Stay calm. You're panicking. That's the kind of man you are. You can't stand to see your wife sick. Go away. Go outside. Fix that seesaw. Would you, Brand? Yes, but not now. Then behave. Do what men do for their sick wives. Go and sit with her. Kiss her fore head. Take care of her. Look at me. if you think there's something wrong, then there is. Something wrong? if you think there's something wrong, then there is. i told you so. - What do you mean? - i told you so. - i don't want it. - it's good for you. Brand, i'm so sick. You need something in your stomach. - No, Kate. - Eat! Don't defy me! - What? - Eat. it's for your own good. - Brand, help me! - Swallow, damn it! - Brand, please! - He's my husband. You don't have a husband. You're up in the air. - Where is Tony? - He doesn't exist. Brand, where is Tony? Tony is in safe hands. He is n't yours. Brand, help me! Brand, help me! Brand, quick. i can't hold her. Where is Tony?
