Back up. Turn around. Action. Slowly. Go lower. Close in on her. Don't move, Nadine. Cut. What are you doing here? Now, you place his head here. This is very important. He's half dead, but you're alive. You hold his head and say: "But I love you." We'll just rehearse the close-up. Then you make love, take him. He'll keep his trousers on now. It'll be much easier when he takes them off. Go ahead, tell him you love him. Go ahead, tell him. - Say it. - Quiet. I love you. Again. I... love you. - I love you. - You feel it, it turns you on. That's when you say: "I love you." Try it. Go on. Feel it. Feel it and say: "I love you." Again. I love you. - I can't, it's... - Yes, you can. No, I can't. It's too... You're getting paid for it. - But... - No "buts," go ahead. Feel it. Put life into it, you love him. Go on. More. More, you love him. I love you. More. Go on. No photos, please. I'm an actress, I do good work. I only do this to eat. No photos. Who's this man? Please. Cut. No photographs. Get off the set. No photographs on the set. Confiscate the film. Get him. Quick. Give us the negative. Make it quick. And the camera. What the hell are you doing? - We said ten o'clock. - He was busy. - Or getting too proud? - Why say that? You know what you are? A nasty bitch. You exaggerate. After all we've done for you. Without us... what would've become of you? The receipt, please. Doesn't he talk? He's English. With the 25 from Thursday, that's it. Tell Mr. Mazelli I fulfilled my contract. - Do we get going? - Does he have to finish his book? If it weren't for Mazelli... Yes, I know, I'd be there. Did I wake you? Yes. We were shooting the whole night. I am sorry. Do you remember me? I took some shots of you yesterday on the set. I sold them for a very good price so I... Well, I should take more. You should? Yes. To make the cover of a very important magazine. Photos without yesterday's shit. I haven't made a cover in a long time, with or without shit. That's a good reason. It's beautiful here. Is it yours? No. A foolish old Austrian saw me once in a film and lends it to us. As long as she's alive. It's great. A fantastic place to shoot photographs. It's time. - Time? What time? - No idea. That changes everything. Sorry to barge in like this, but your telephone's out of order. No, it's been cut off. Coffee everyone? My husband makes very good coffee. Coffee? I'm at your disposal, sir. No make-up? Won't you comb your hair? No preparation...? Why? I have the face I have. I'm 30. You don't like it? It's not that. I just want to make a cover. To sell a cover, one needs... Something more... sexy. Like this? Wait a minute. Like this? More? Like this? That's it. Let's use the light. Come here, yes. Lift your head. Tilt your head back. Nice. Yes, like that. Hold it. Yes, that way. Give me more profile. Excellent. - Jacques Chevalier. - Servais Mont. Do you work for an agency? Several. I freelance. I'm interested indirectly, I'm a collector. - Of agencies? - Photos. Louise Brooks, Baclanova, Marilyn, Marlene Dietrich... James Dean. Excuse me. Vitruvius, the architect, says extended arms equal one's height... from chin to cranium, one-eighth of one's height, the width of the shoulders represents one-fourth of a man, and from the nipples to the head, one-fourth of a woman. Leonardo da Vinci. Be gentle with my wife, she's pregnant. - He says any old thing. - What was your last film? - In Italy... nothing good. - I don't agree. What was the name? It was first called The Turkish Dog, then Nymphocula, which is a lot better. Tell me. I dreamt you were pouring coke in my ear. A nasty death. - Stop it, Jack, we have to work. - Work, go ahead. Anyway, having coffee in my bath is a must. What's the matter? Nothing. We can stop if you want. Do you have enough photos? If I ask to see you again, will you throw me out? Immediately. When? Tomorrow, St. Germain, at four? Here at three. Alright? It's you? My lift is out of order for ten days. Seven flights when I was your age was nothing, but now... - So, you want to stay? - I don't want to be in your way. Just say a word and... I'll climb my seven flights. Drop it. I'm really tired today. I had a call from Mr. Mazelli. So it's Mazelli, not your lift. You see, you get mad right away. He just talked to me. He's hurt. He's has reasons. I paid him back, didn't I? Mr. Mazelli can leave me alone. Money's not everything. You prefer to see me work in a slum as long as Mazelli buys your drinks. Is that what you want? Remember who you're talking to and don't lecture me. Me neither. Take a seat. The sheets are in the closet. I have to unpack my shirts. I don't owe you anything anymore. I'm saying... You're here? No, I'm not here anymore. I'm leaving. Good night. Just slam the door when you leave. I met a girl. She works next door, at Wimpy's. She makes French fries. She's a Negro, well... she's a mix. She's nice. She has a little boy. The father left her. His name is Gerard, like me. Well? What did you do in the film? Three days. I'm bitter. It must be my age. A wild guess: you'll be fifty tomorrow. I'm thirty. It's the second time you told me. The photographs didn't turn out because... you're much more beautiful. Really. I've made myself up, I've combed my hair. I've dusted the room... and my husband's at the movies. That's it. Since we're here, let's do things traditionally. Traditionally? Aren't you going to bring out your medieval liqueur? Tell me where the bar is, I'll serve you a drink. Why? You're not comfortable? Yes, I'm fine. I haven't much time and we're not here for that. - Then we're here for what? - To be together? So? Now you're wondering what you're going to say? Yes, and... you're not making things easy. On the contrary. Isn't it now you drag me into bed? Yes. More or less. It's rather less than more? You're used to this sort of thing, aren't you? You too. You've been married long? - Six years. - What does he do? You really want me to talk about him? No, but... It's better than talking about other things and thinking about him, isn't it? I wonder. Well, what do we do? I wouldn't know. If we don't make love and if you don't go, we have to do something. Such as? Talk. About what? Well... about ourselves. And you think it'll help us? How? To be together. That's the reason we're here. You start. Well... I can talk... about myself. Shall I talk about the war in Algiers and Vietnam? Are you really interested? You see. Too bad. You know what time it is? I'm sorry, but I must see Nadine. - You're mad, it's 5am. - It's urgent. - Call her tomorrow. She's asleep. - No, sorry. Get out. How's life? Life's shit. Isn't it kind of early? It's eight o'clock. Then you did right. I usually wake up around noon. I don't feel great. It's 8 am not pm. - ls Luce sick? - It's not about her. Another woman? And you come to me? You're the only person I can talk to. Stupid, isn't it? Not at all. It's interesting. Is she an intellectual? No. An actress. If she's an actress... you've done the right thing. And I should help you to betray my wife? - I never loved your wife. - That's not my fault. Shit, everything's my fault. Let's not be fussy. What's the problem with your stage girl? The problem? I come here, wake you up at eight like an idiot. "What's the problem?" I don't know how, but I want to help her. What have I got to do with it? It's because you ball my wife. I get it. We're in the Western World, the solution will be capitalistic. How much do you love her? What? When I was small, a century ago, my mother used to say: "You love Mummy a lot?" I'd answer: "I love Mummy a lot." But that wasn't enough for her. So she'd ask: "How much do you love her? 10 sous... 100 sous?" Now, I'm asking you: how much do you love her? - I don't get you. - Do you want to ball her or not? And it's not for free. That's the way it goes with a crumb like you. I've got a solution for you. I know a sick fellow who's trying to put on a play and he's broke. A play... get it? The theatre. The lights dim. The curtain rises. "O despair. O cursed race." So? You buy it? - Are you still drunk or mad? - She's an actress, right? Actors have to act. Since you don't love my wife, you have to pay. I'll call the chap for an appointment. You're not taking me for a ride? I'm not sure of anything, and it's killing me. - It's beautiful. - Lapade didn't tell you? Yes, he did. Karl Heinz Zimmer. May I dry my hair while listening? - You're an actor, right? - No, not at all. Too bad. It's about an actress. Her name is... Nadine Chevalier. Isn't it beautiful? Yes, very. I brought photographs of her. Superb. Beautiful. Lapade told me... He will soon die like my brother. You know what he died of? Of disgust. People have problems. - I know. - He knows. I invested in the play. The director got a city subvention. You see, we are reduced to the exigencies of cinema. No stars, no money. And the little fame I had in Germany didn't follow me here. Karl Heinz Zimmer. Does my name mean anything to you? You brute. Isn't he a shit? You'll have to talk to the director about her. I'm only an actor. Where can I see him? Why, right here. He moved here. His heating system broke down. It's not a question of ambition, it's the mechanism of power. Shakespeare's Machiavellian virtues are astonishing. But his plays mustn't be drowned in incoherence. Is there a part for Nadine Chevalier? The only important role in Richard III is Lady Anne, one of the greatest female roles there is. - Is she skilled? - What does that mean? Well, has she played anywhere? Is she classical? She was in a film called Nymphocula. But of course, two lesbians in a castle with a dwarf. That was a Pontini. Superb. How was she? She was good. I mean great. Superb. That changes everything. Except the financial problem. - How much is missing? - Ten grand. What's the production cost? Including us? Fifty grand. But on one condition: she must never know I had anything to do with it. Is that clear? Listen. Don't judge him now, Messala is a great director. Ask in Paris. He's the best. Here you are, my boy. - How goes? - I've been looking for you everywhere. My boy. We'll take care of that problem. Hector called. He says you've turned proud. When he says proud, he means ungrateful. I said: "No, Hector, he's a nice boy, still a little young, that's all." You need me? A little party at my place on the 31st. A few important friends. We want to keep souvenirs. I need money. - I'm counting on you. - All I want is to be generous. Goodbye. No problem, boy. - The girls can't come before Friday. - I said Wednesday. They're stuck in Munich. Customs. Serious? Kiss him and go. You've lost weight, you don't eat. I eat. Come to eat when you want. You won't come. How much? Ten grand. That's a lot of money. You're in trouble? I'm sick. You'll have to work well... not like before. Money's expensive nowadays. You'll have to take more risks. You'll have to put your pride aside. - You accept? - Don't bug me. By the way, your father cheated me out of... Does he know you saved his life? Let's open a new account. - How much did you say? - Ten. Well, that makes 100,000. And your father, how's he? "and her father, not all so much for love, As for another secret intent by marrying her which I must reach unto. But yet I run before my horse to market. Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns. When they are gone, then I must count my gains." "Set down, set down your honourable load, If honour may be shrouded in a hearse, Poor, key-cold figure of a holy king. Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood. Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost..." Just a minute. Excuse me. Would you mind, darling children, if I said we're going head first into disaster? I say that because I'm happy you're here. What we'll do will be good. We'll be among ourselves for a few weeks. One day we'll face the audience. The audience. And we'll say: "We worked for them." We'll ask ourselves: "Will they like us?" I want to warn you as of now. Don't give them what they want. They don't know. Don't go to them, you'll get lost. I am expecting you will never, never be... satisfied with yourselves. Reach the most demanding depth you can find in yourselves. You will then have a chance... to be accepted. Please, my little one. Let's continue. "More direful hap betide that hated wretch, That makes us wretched by the death of thee, Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads, or any creeping venomed thing that lives. If ever he have child, abortive be it, Prodigious, and untimely brought to light, Whose ugly and unnatural aspect may fright the hopeful mother... If ever he have wife, let her be made As miserable by the death of him as I am made..." I can't... Stay here. I'll go. Keep calm. Gentlemen, please. Let's take Scene 3. Calm down. It's happened to all of us. He wasn't talking about you. We're all puppets with careers that fall apart. Why do you think we're all here? Just like you, we're all waiting for a break. Come now. I'm washed up. Do you understand? No, I don't. I feel old... I'm tired. No one tried harder. No one. No one tried to give more... That's all I can do for you. I'm not joking. I don't choose. I don't try to understand. I don't follow any direction. I accept myself. Look at yourself. You're beautiful. I'd give anything to be like you. Understand? Come on. The fat one on the right. We must recognise her. See her? Go ahead. Now the old one with the two men. Wait, wait... It's coming. Look at the small brunette with the transvestites. Make sure you get her. - Don't get upset. - Look. isn't that a disgrace? Calm yourself, it's bad for your blood pressure. Can't help it. It makes me sick. It's money, but it's disgusting. Look at that bitch. Is the music keeping you awake? I'm out of sleeping pills. I have to go near my place. They know me at the pharmacy. There's some chicken in the refrigerator. I'm not hungry at all. I'm glad it's alright with Mazelli. One never has too many friends. What happened with your Wimpy girl? Down the drain. She's with the cook. A fat Italian. I take her boy out sometimes. I took him to the park this afternoon, and you know why? He's in love with a bitch his age. She refuses to play with him. He just stares at her like an idiot. He's miserable and he's five years-old. You know? With your mother it wasn't always bad. To hell with her. I'm sorry. At the beginning, when I worked for Mazelli... before you were born, we were happy... although it didn't last. She was beautiful. Time complicates everything. It's when we don't know where we're going... Time flies by. Don't become an old fool like me. "Sweet saint, for charity, be not so cursed." "Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not, For thou hast made the happy world thy hell, Filled with cursing cries and deep exclaims. If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds, Behold this pattern of thy butcheries. Gentlemen, see, see." Would you mind stepping into the coffin? It would help your wife in this scene. Well, what are you waiting for? Continue. "Thou lump of foul deformity, For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins. O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death." "Lady, you know no rules of charity, which renders good for bad? Blessings for curses." "Villain, thou knowest not law of God nor man, Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst but hang thyself." Perfect. But be careful. You don't carry it enough. Shit, what more do you need? But there will be men building an iron cage. - They'll be using a blow-torch. - A what? A blow-torch. He's sick. - I'm working for a sick man. - Let's continue. I need to recuperate. I'm recuperating, please. Take five minutes. I have to go now. I was good? I said five minutes. Go to hell. The ghost has returned. This time I'll talk to him. Did you like it? You come every day? Yes, I'm a friend of Messala, the director. I see. Another friend from your regiment? So, you came for him? Yes. Well, no. It's... It's what? I'm cold. In all my plays, there was a ghost. A man who sits in the last row, who watches... and no one knows why he's there. This time, I know the ghost. Do you like theatre? Listen to me. I'm neither a victim nor a prisoner. My life is what it is, even if you don't think it's a success. The ghost in my last play, six years ago, I married him and I love him. Here's our 5 a.m. door-breaker. You read Le Figaro, don't you? It's the only paper that mentioned Nadine. He's a friend of Messala's. A friend of Messala's... It's obvious. Just look at him. Look at what I found. A South American record, Georgio Cassati. Fantastic. - I have to go. - Nice, isn't it? Listen, come and eat at our place. But I'm doing the cooking. Come here. Tell him. He's right. Come tomorrow evening, please. - Please. - Why not? Fuck me. Please. You're mad, I haven't taken the pill. Love me. What's the matter? We've eaten cat food... and it hasn't agreed with us. I'd read on the can there were good things in it. What's that? Two old bats. They're going to croak soon. They snore all night and stare all day. How can I sleep under such conditions? Could you take the dog, I'm afraid to drop her. That's nice of you. - Can you walk? - Yes, I'm alright. Solitude is the food of the soul. How are things with your stage girl? We're together. I really missed everything. Luce will never forgive me. Delirium tremens. Nothing to do with what he ate. His liver is enormous. He must have known how it would end. I came as soon as you called. Can I see him? He's just out of coma. I've had it. It happens to the best people. Parasites end up together. Look at that. I don't want the hospital. They give you shit to eat. Tell them. You're not sorry for me. You're right. People have no more destiny for they have no morals, and they have no morals for they have no illusions. And my best time was this. And you... you don't exist. You think you're king of the earth, but you're nothing but a dead man and I curse you. You'll take care of Doriot? She's with the concierge. Yes, don't worry. I could've left her with Luce... but I don't want my two wives together... and since you got the first one... I can croak in peace. It's long. I hate to tell you this... but I think I'm going to be sick. Be careful, you're among lunatics here. We started a film magazine last year. Just four issues, but they were good. Then, I was switchboard operator and driver for tea-tasters. I studied medicine before, to be like my uncle who's an ambulance driver, but it didn't work. I met Nadine and took care of her. Actresses are fragile, they break easy. She was on a dangerous slope at the time. You know, drugs and the rest. And then, Zorro came to the rescue. You see. She was sure you wouldn't come. Clear the table for dinner. What is this? America? Let's finish our trading session. Servais Mont, this is Roger Beninge. Raymond Manuel Rosenthal. He's dreaming. My best "de Carlos" against bad reprints. You call these reprints. They're rubbish. Here, look. That's a reprint? Look closer. Be careful with those plates. Are you mad? This is Miriam Hopkins. - In what film? - She Loves Me Not. Who with? With... Bing Crosby. And Kitty Carlisle. I got it. It'll cost a lot? Yvonne de Carlo? - All of them? - All. What did you think? Seen anything more beautiful? It's beautiful, isn't it? Beautiful. Sepia print. This goes directly into the safe. He's the only one who still has Bing Crosby. Bastard. All Yvonne de Carlo. Salome is enough for him. Forgive me, Yvonne. Shit, the food's burning. Do you remember? - What? - Rue de Verneuil. A tiny room with a tiny thing to cook on. Everything was tiny. The bed was so narrow, we had to turn around simultaneously. Now we have a large one, and we still turn simultaneously. That's marriage. Right, darling? Fritzy has her little habits now. Don't you find her provincial? You don't know her. Help yourselves. Take some of this. - I don't feel like it. - You don't eat. No wonder your breasts are starting to sag. When I met her, she smoked three packs a day. Nicotine was coming out of her ears. But then, Zorro came to rescue the old girl. Do you think Messala wants her? Who? Nadine. He had all his actors. Suddenly he fires the girl for Nadine. Don't you think that's strange? He's queer. So what? I'm queer too. Doesn't matter. You've got a little boy's arse. Small, round and juvenile. - I saw Nymphocula six times. - It has a few good shots. You saw Nymphocula? You don't like porn films? I like them. Nadine does them but hates them. She's a puritan. She's done everything and is becoming even more puritan. She discovered she had principles. You can take her knickers off, but she still has her principles. She couldn't explain her principles though. They're just there... like rails. And she sticks to them, even if they burn her feet... like right now. Why do you talk like this? It's embarrassing and useless. I forgot I had an appointment at the agency. I'm sorry, but I have to... go. Did you speak to him? - Can I buy you a coffee? - No, I'll stay here. I didn't leave him for you. I know that. Tell me something. Are we through? What is it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Something's happened. I can't explain, but... I'm afraid of harming someone. I am trapped... because I feel that... if I go further, I'll do some harm. And if I stop... I'll do even more harm. "Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York, Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths, Our bruised arms hung up for monuments, Our stern alarms changed to merry meetings, Our marches to delightful measures. Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his front, And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds, He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute. But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, I... cheated of feature by dissembling nature, I, sent into this breathing world, scarce, half made up, And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them. I..." And then, one hears a rooster back stage. As usual Antoine shouts: "Terrible." The stage manager runs to him, holding a cockerel by the neck. "This is a real one, Mr. Antoine." And Antoine answers: "He's terrible, we must replace him." What is she doing? She should be here. I'm in no hurry. - I had to wait, it came late. - Give me that. Do you know everyone here? My wife. Sit down. "What can one say about such a fiasco? That others did well where Messala got lost. Excessive, dark. Expressionistic without rhyme or reason... his directing is a mixture of contradicting intentions and of random ideas. The only evidence is that of chaos. I first discard Nadine Chevalier who deserted a certain type of films about which I'd rather remain silent. As for Zimmer, he gave the poorest performance I've ever had occasion to see. Stop directing, Messala. You like it, but it doesn't like you." Rubbish newspaper. The oracle has spoken. That's Bilimerle. The others will have to admit that... Shut up. Back to the "Help Wanted" ads. My overcoat, sir. My overcoat, you touched it. So what? So what? I paid a lot for this overcoat. Since I'm a well-bred homosexual, I care a lot for my things. - Calm down. - Silence. I don't like your kind. You touched me with your proletarian fingers. - If that's what you want... - You touched me again. So what? And so good night, sir. Let go of me. Watch out. If you're as vulgar as he, it will be perfect. Poor Karl, he never could take a bad notice. I really liked it. You couldn't care less, right? Of course, I mostly looked at my wife. It's amazing all you got out of her. Those screams, howls... all that. It must be what you people call life. I'd always wondered... but now I know. And him, the photographer. What's he doing here anyway? All I can say... is that all of you are really starting to piss me off. Darlings... I might as well say it now: it's a flop. All the notices will be like this one. With luck, we'll get through the thirty required performances. Perhaps we won't. Selling the costumes... I may manage to pay something to the people who trusted me. That's all I had to tell you. I'm sorry. - Did he say anything? - Yes, a few verses from Rimbaud. "Turmoil originated your poetry, immense forces served you, your entrails burst, death menaces, Chosen City. Consume your shrieks in the Deaf Trumpet." Bizarre, is it not? Where's Raymond Lapade? In the lift. - And his wife? - She left immediately. There he is. A man opened the door for me. He told me to wait inside. I preferred waiting here. He said he wouldn't be back and that he had told you all he had to say. This is Doriot, the second wife of the play's adapter. I'll give her to animal lovers. She deserves better than me. Coffee? That's all I have. I came to pay my debt. I have one toward Jacques... a big one. I'd be pretty low if I hadn't met him. I'd be... I don't know. A prostitute. Do you understand? You see, you were right. A woman can always be bought. And then you'll leave, right? Does he know you're here? You'll never tell him? Then, it's better you leave now. I went to Servais'... to sleep with him. He refused. How's his place? Empty, sinister. You must give me a respite. We've had breakfast together for six years, so you must give me a chance. A little time, a month or two. You see... I stopped to breathe. One mustn't breathe. So, you agree? Nadine told me everything. Why are you here then? Don't you get it? I'm trying to help you out here. I'll tell you my life's story with all the sordid details. The more I cry, the more you'll pity me and the less tricks you'll pull. Don't build pity into a monument. And I don't want to pull tricks. This is just as bad for me. Nadine promised she won't try to see you again. Well then... there's no problem. What do you mean, no problem? Congratulations. Well done. Refusing to go to bed with my wife, you call that nothing? You want to know? I love it. I love it, honest I do. I become like a beast. Tit for tat. - I'll ask you a favour. - Go to hell. Help me. Help me, shit. Do something. You know how to make things happen... and I don't. You see, Nadine owes me a respite. Do I owe you anything? Yes, because you didn't sleep with her. I feel knackered. I went to see that film I'd missed. Any good? Some interesting things. Special effects mostly. - Did you get a crowd? - Forty-five people, twenty paid. The big success. You should've seen those Cyclops... fighting Titans... throwing whole mountains at them. The Titans were throwing whole countries back at them. The whole thing nicely blended in minestrone music. You see what I mean. Strange. I'm tired. I work and I'm tired. Do you understand that? I still have you? Don't forget to say your prayers. My God... I'm fed up. Thanks for coming. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Why hide your breasts? - Don't you stay here doing nothing. She was getting on his nerves. He got her under control. But why hide her breasts? He must've removed something to be more convincing. Interesting. I came to say goodbye. I'm leaving for Manaus. The Sarah Bernhardt theatre. I'm playing Vladimir in Godot. It's all over? Listen, I'm very well off. Family money. Please accept this. For me it's nothing. I think it's a lot for you. I don't want your money. I'm very fond of Nadine. You're mad. Rich. Philosophically speaking, the medieval period was a catastrophe, but we owe to it the peculiar concept... of a woman's honour. Let's drink to that. Get lost. It's taken care of. Listen... you should've called, we could've met elsewhere. I tried. Your telephone is still cut off. No wonder it doesn't ring much. Can I talk to you? Alright? I'm here for Jacques. Coffee, tea, wine, cognac, whiskey? Ham, butter, my briefcase? No, thank you, Jacques. We're listening. Watch what you're doing. You didn't get it. He's doing this for me. For me? It's for me. That's him. Yes, it's him. Saint Francis of Assisi in person. Strong. Handsome. I'll be able to keep my Marilyn collection. Louise Brooks. You must thank the man, Nadine. You have to thank him. Thank him, go ahead. Don't you kiss me? I am here. Can you be at Petit Louis tomorrow at 4:00? Where? Of course, she forgot. The café, rue de Verneuil. You remember? I remember. I'll have things to tell you. - I nearly called the fire brigade. - Sorry, I'm late. A chap committed suicide in the subway. I was stuck for a half hour. Nothing's changed here. What have you done? I've managed to get a dubbing job. I'm dubbing Jane Fonda. - When do you start? - On the 14th. - Coffee with... - With rum. Yes, but no... Do you know what the lousiest thing is? The most disgusting? Pity. Why? Because it's final. I know what you think of me. Of all my bullshit. There's a word for it. A word. I found it in my dictionary. Contempt. I don't have contempt for you. What's happening to us? I don't know anymore. I'm always there... waiting. I want you so much. I need you so much. There is no one in the world I love more. No one. So... you mustn't leave me alone. You mustn't. I can't be alone. Where are you? Where? Here? I don't know where you are. I can still give you a lot. Everything. But... I don't want to feel that life is elsewhere. I can't. I could do anything for you. Anything. Anything except... Except what? Live. I can say I love you. "I love you" means nothing. Nothing. You understand? It means nothing. You understood everything. Is that all? What? Many women would find it a lot. Especially in Yemen. May the gods... scatter roses on your path. I have to telephone. See you at home? Where do you think you are? Look at all that mess. Unbelievable. Is this the agency? May I speak to Servais Mont? That's it. Come with me. What a fool. Why did he do it? Why? He should've done it before. Before he met you. Why did he do it? He should've done it before. Do you understand? Help me. Come. He sold all his photographs... except these. No one wanted them. He put the money in the bank in my name. They gave me a shot to make me sleep. Go now. I'll go when you sleep. Nothing's possible between us anymore. It's the shot. It won't last. I hope, it gets on my nerves. My face must not be seen. It's nothing, we'll start soon. It'll pass. She'll be all right. He'll do a good job? You can trust him, he's a specialist. We haven't talked about our next meeting. I've arranged something for Friday. I'm through. Do without me. Your grandma dyke disgusted me. Don't you think it disgusts me too? But they're all alike. Do you know what man is like? He's like "the ugliest things he can do." He's like "when he sits on the can." Force yourself to look at what disgusts you. When you see yourself in a mirror, do like me: think about something else. I'm through. I've had enough. Not so fast. When I met you, you were that small. I could've crushed you like a tadpole. Too bad you didn't. Perhaps, but since your father, to say the least, hasn't much backbone, therefore if you're now big and strong, it's thanks to me. I'm a bit... your father somehow. Think of it. I'm a bit the father of all of them. They tell me their troubles. I listen. They disgust me, but I like them. So, like God, I'll say: you're free. No one was ever forced to work with Mazelli. You forgot to talk about the day you saved my life during the war... and risked yours stealing milk from the Germans. Go to hell. You owe me a lot of money. If you quit working for me you'll have to pay me back. I'll give you ten days because I like you. God... only took six days to create the world. As you see, I'm lenient. It's us. Hello, young man, playing hide and seek with Mazelli? I had said ten days. It's been eleven days. Eleven days of anxiety for good old Mazelli. I can pay you back. It's on the mantelpiece. What did I say? Look at his face. I knew you were not eating. Do you sleep at least? When you don't eat, you must sleep. We always have a bed for you. You'll never learn. It's not a matter of money but of principle. I was wrong about you, and Hector was right. You've become proud. You know what's coming to you? What was due to your father three years ago. Normally people like us don't exist. I know it, but I'm the only one. Each morning when I see myself, I say: "This is not real." So, since we don't exist, we must find a way to be accepted? That's what you're doing now. You're accepting. Good-bye, young man. I liked you. I love you. I love you.
