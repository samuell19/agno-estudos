Help me. Help me, please. Help me. Help me, please. Help me, please. Help me. Help me... THE MURDERER Good morning, folks. Let's welcome the new day with this gruesome news from Roi Et province. Last night, a mass murder left seven family members dead inside a farmhouse in Bung Klua subdistrict. The seven victims lived in or near the same house. They are Mr. Boonluck, head of the family. Ms. Parsuree, elder sister of Boonluck's wife. Mr. Boonjong or Kai, Boonluck's son. Mr. Sakda or Phet, Kai's close friend. Ms. Kewalin or Tukta, Kai's ex-wife. And Tukta's American husband, Charlie. A police officer was also shot dead. The suspect is Earl Cunningham, of British nationality, Boonluck's son-in-law. Eyewitnesses are being questioned by the police. A MURDER OF SEVEN PEOPLE IN BUNG KLUA Chief of Northeastern Division has assigned Pol. Major Nawat Banluecha, the top-ranking detective, also known as "The Hot-Headed Crime-Buster" of Don Kratok district, to lead the investigation. Don't make things complicated. Look. I really didn't see anything. What do you want me to say? Told you I passed out. MASS MURDER BY MANIAC WHITE MAN IN-LAW LEFT 7 DEAD Don't be sad. Everyone knows what happened that night. You're still young. Find yourself a new husband. I don't want a new husband. The white man won't get out of this. He butchered the whole goddamn family. You know and I know, we all know who did it. Sai, you're the sole eyewitness. Just testify that the white man did it. Case closed. He goes to jail. It's over and done with! But Earl really didn't do it. What the hell are you doing, dumbass? The girl is crying, give it to her! You're so smart at being dumb. Wait! Bring me a shirt! Watch this. What is it? Hello, everyone! Kitty News brings you the latest update on the murderous white man case. Guys... This morning, a wandering hermit called Attiyaso Yoda, visited the house. Let's hear from him. It happened 20 years ago in the USA. A serial killer was shot and wounded by the police. Before he died, he used a voodoo spell to remove his spirit and put it inside a doll. The doll possessed the white man and it had been waiting to massacre people! It's like that film Chucky. Have you ever seen it? Yes. It's horrifying. That creepy doll. It chased people around and stabbed them. Horrible. Hey! You're distracting me! Now, tell me what happened when you first came back with your white husband. I remember the news was warning us about a storm. The biggest and most violent storm in decades was about to hit the Isan region. The weather agency has issued an emergency warning no. 11 about the most powerful storm in 20 years. Its center lies 190 km from the western coast of Vietnam. The highest wind speed is 50 km per hour. The storm is expected to enter the Northeast of Thailand at midnight. The shape... No, I want to get there quickly. Tukta? Kai is the worst of the worst. THE ARRIVAL OF THE WHITE MAN IN-LAW Hi, Dad. Why did you buy all this stuff? Earl wants to board up the house before the storm hits. So we all will be safe, unlike before. Are you so afraid of storms? I've seen storms since I was a kid. Your white husband knows shit. Enough with that. Sawasdee krub. Where's June? She's gone to the market. She'll be back soon. Where's June? It's none of your business. Don't be a smart-ass. A storm is coming. I'll take June to stay with Jamie. My house is safer than here. June is safe here too. Safe? But it looks like you're building an ark to get away from the storm. My dad was a ship-builder. I can give you a hand. Sai, won't you introduce your husband to me? In your dream. I don't want my husband to fall prey to you. Well, I have a bagful of tricks. If men keep falling for me, it's not my fault. But it's your fault that June grew up without a mom. I have to work. And your brother, Kai, is too dumb to raise our daughter. But you've never cared about June since you left home to work in Pattaya. What's wrong with working in a bar? Look at yourself. An educated girl who ends up a low-ranking hotel clerk, desperate to leech off a white husband. You're no different from me. Wrong. I never need my husband to support me like you do. And I can take care of June. Now, get out. Just you watch. I'll take June back no matter what. If you won't give her back nicely, see you in court! Go, Charlie, we're leaving! Darling. Tee rak. What? What if I hang around and give Earl a hand here? You know I love construction work. Whatever. Fat bastard. THE SUSPECT Hey, white man! Are you going to confess or not? Hey! Do you know how I got this scar? The story will make you shudder! Years ago, there was a hippy white man, like you. Tripped out on meth, he put a knife to his wife's throat. Nobody dared come near him. Except me! White man! Police, my ass. - White man, drop the knife! - I won't! - Drop it! - I won't! - Drop it! - I won't! Drop it! That's it! That's why I hate white men like you. Lazy asses do nothing all day but think about sex, booze, and drugs! Joi! He won't talk, show him what will happen to him! So? Will you tell me the truth now? THAI COCK BUT NO ONE CAN ESCAPE DEATH Hey! What are they doing? So noisy! Tukta is a bitch. She came to pick a fight on our turf. Just because her husband built her a new house, she prances around like a queen. Well, she kind of is. Sai, when will your husband build you a house? Earl is not an ATM. I can't press money out of him. You screwed up. You picked a poor white husband. You know what, Sai? The majority of white men marry Isan girls because they want us to be their maids when they're old. Someone to help them get up, to clean their piss and shit. Just like that, my poor girl! Sai, I forgot. Your ex-husband will join us this evening. What? Phet is coming? What's wrong with that? Phet is your brother's friend. You bet. Losers always stick together. Damn, your white husband is no better than Phet. Don't be so snooty. Think about it. He took a Thai wife only because no white woman wanted him. Anyway, Sai, is it true the white men... have huge weenies? Like this? Stop it! It's tasty too, right? Tasty weenie. THE GIRL Do I scare you? I guess my scar really scares you, right? No need to be scared. I'll tell you the secret of how I got this scar. Do you want to hear it? When I was a boy, I hated dung beetles so much. Every time I saw them, I crushed them to death. When I was your age, I went to help my mom in the field. Slash! The dung beetle was killed on the spot! I've got you! It shouldn't have messed with me! Now, little girl... I've already told you my secret, it's your turn to tell me what happened. That day you went to the market, do you remember that? Yes, I went to the market that day. And when you came back, did you see your white uncle argue with your grandparents? No. It's Grandpa who was so grumpy. He cursed everyone. I didn't know what was wrong with him, but he was so bad-tempered. Nothing grows here. It's terrible. Nothing to harvest at all. June! Where the hell have you been? You didn't give me the bus fare, so I walked. It took forever! Stop! Don't talk back to me. Get the food to your grandma. A storm is coming, don't you see? And tell your white uncle not to wreck my house. Damn. Aren't you all curious what he's doing? Maybe he wants to lock us up inside the house. Goddamn white man! I know what you're up to! You're plotting something against us! Do you need help? Hey. How are you, little cupcake? Mom, how is June doing? How is she doing? She's fine because I feed her. They made a baby and now it's my burden to raise it. Don't be so mean! June. Auntie Sai! June! Why you dropped it like that? We need that for dinner, go pick it up! When did you arrive? Just now. How about you? Do you miss me? These two love each other so much. When will you take me to live with you in Bangkok? Soon. Let me talk to your dad first. Oh, Earl and I got you a present. Are you excited? What is it? I'll show you after dinner. June, where are you? I told you to take the laundry into the house! Why didn't you do it? You never listened to me! Calm down, old man! You'll have a heart attack getting worked up like that! June is your grandchild, not your maid! June, I'll help you collect the laundry, then we'll go for a ride, okay? Yes. Do you like it? When I was a boy, I loved these candies. I bought them every time I saw them. But you know what? The shopkeeper sometimes tricked me by wrapping blank paper with nothing inside. I was so angry when I unwrapped it and it was empty. I hate it when people lie to me. Do you understand? So what happened next? Auntie Sai drove me to see Jamie. Who's Jamie? Don't tell me there's another white man! Jamie is the son of Charlie, who is my mother's new husband. Can you understand Jamie? Sort of. Jamie can speak a little Thai. I have no friends, Jamie has none either. So we became close. The slope is too steep. My car can't go any further. Can you walk up? Go play with your friend. But not too long, a storm is coming. Yes. Jamie! - Let's go fly a kite. - Okay. How's your shoulder? Let me see. Still in pain? A lot of pain. I'd rather die with my family. You'll be fine. It's nothing serious. Why am I still alive? My husband's dead, I should've been dead too. You can die later. Now help me first, all right? Let's put that asshole in jail. Your daughter is useless. Don't believe anything Sai tells you. She's crazy about her white husband. She's totally devoted to him from the start. THE FORTUNE-TELLER'S PREDICTION Sai, you're still young. Why don't you find a rich man who can make you happy? Don't waste your time with this shitty white man. Do you remember the warning of that fortune-teller from Sarakham? Think about it. What is this about, Mom? I'm so confused. Well... The fortune-teller said you'll become a widow at 30. Now you're 29. Have you really forgotten what she said? Gosh, that's baloney. Baloney? Watch out, my dear. Soon, you'll become a parched-pussy widow just like me! Suit yourself. If something happens to your white husband, don't come crying to me. Right. How long did you plan to keep the prediction from me? You're withholding evidence from an officer! Are you nuts? Since when a fortune-teller's prediction is police evidence? I'm speechless! Maybe the white man got an idea from that fortune-teller. Look. What's this? Take a look. Do you really not know your husband has bought you life insurance? When you die, he'll become filthy rich. He never said a word about it. You're so naive. How well do you know your husband? The white man had planned everything. When your family found out, he had to murder everyone. Earl is not that kind of person. Then tell me what really happened that night. Convince me that you're not conspiring with him. That night, we were having dinner. But it was awkward because Earl was there and my ex-husband, Phet, was also there. It was very uncomfortable. Kai, what's the white man's name? Er. His name is Er. What kind of name is that? I don't know. Everybody calls him "Er." Are you sure? Have your ears checked. Ask him yourself. Sai. What's the white man's name? Earl. See? His name is "Er." Mr. Er. What the heck? This soup is damn tasty. Go get some more. It's so little. Is it that good? - Kai? - It's spicy as hell. Where did you get it from? Are you full? Have some more. - It's awesome. - Tasty. - So good. - Let me drink it first. - Gosh, it's awesome. - You made it very delicious today. You're right. It's so good. It's really tasty. Good, good. Have a big bite. It's nothing. Bring Som Tum closer. It's so good. Gosh. - Be careful. - Watch it. You're interrupting the meal. You've got a bump on your head. It's so good. Do you want more? Bring it. - Have some more. - Why is it so delicious? - It's awesome. - Right? BUT NO ONE CAN ESCAPE DEATH Who's that? It's me, June. Come in, sweetie. My bad! I forgot all about your present. How do you know I wanted a phone? All your friends have them, right? Yes, I'm the only one who doesn't have a phone. Tomorrow, I'll show it to all my friends at school. A man with no looks can't stay... Even a monk tells him to go away... It's Kai and Phet again. You don't know this song? A gun with no bullets can't kill a man A fiddle with no strings can't join a band A man with no looks can't stay Even a monk tells him to go away... - Damn, the power's out! - Power's out. A storm is coming for sure tomorrow. Wait a minute, detective. Look! Earl didn't sign it. He's not the beneficiary. This document has no legal effect. Earl has been set up! You're covering up for him. It means... You've been conspiring with him from the start! Admit it! Conspiring, my ass! Who'd kill their own parents? And what for? It's impossible! Impossible? Let's replay the scene. That night your husband came down and saw your brother and your ex-husband. Easy, man! Let's talk! Don't get upset! - Calm down! - Easy, man! He immediately jumped right at them. Those two tried to fight him off, but the white man was too strong. No! Please don't hurt me! Don't... Like this? Who told you this? You talked like you'd seen it yourself. Come in. What's this? Can't you find a more decent one? This is the most decent we have. Scram! Then what happened? I heard Kai and Phet scream. Enough! The white man has gone mad! Run! Just run. I heard my dad holler. Then Kai's pickup truck drove off. THE BLOODY SHIRT At 8:00 p.m. that night, you heard your grandpa scream, right? Yes. You white prick, why did you kill my son? Jan! Jan! The white man killed Kai! He killed our Kai! Jan, the white man killed Kai! He killed our Kai! Jan, he killed our Kai! What's wrong? Here. Whose blood is this? It's Kai's. He killed Kai and Phet. I saw it with my own eyes. He hit them with a hammer. There's blood everywhere! - We have to tell Par. - Let's go. Par! Wake up! Par! You scared me! Husband. You've come back for me. What the hell are you talking about? I heard my husband's voice. Jan, my husband has come back as a ghost to haunt you. Gosh. There's no ghost! It's the white man! He's on a killing spree! What? Why would he do that? He already killed Kai and Phet. We have to tell Sai. Wait, Jan! We have to think. What will we do if we run into him? You're right. We need a weapon to protect ourselves. What's going on here? Your husband just killed Kai and Phet. What are you talking about? Look! Yes, that's Earl's shirt. He hurt himself in an accident. Now do you believe me? The fortune-teller's right! Mom. Your husband just killed your own brother. Go see it for yourself. I will. Where's Kai's body? Outside, covered in blood. Go see it. Take me to see it. Auntie Par, please help me find the first aid kit. I couldn't find it. All right. Show me. See? I told you Earl was cut by a broken glass. You're calling me a liar? Then where are those two? See, the truck is gone too. They've stolen the truck and run off. They're not dead! How do you know? Maybe the white man took the truck. That's absolutely impossible. Earl is in my room. Par! Par has gone upstairs! We must go up to see Par! Your aunt has gone upstairs alone. What if he kills her too? Could you stop? Why would Earl do that? Par! Par! THE FIRST BODY BLOOD UNDER THE FINGERNAILS The forensic experts are analyzing the traces of blood found in Auntie Par's fingernails. I'm willing to bet that the blood belongs to your white husband. Look at this. Do you want to know... what I think happened? I think that night, your aunt was looking for the first aid kit. She wandered into your room. The white man had been lying in wait, like a tiger waiting for its prey. She tried to fight back but failed. She scratched his arm with her nails once. He was absolutely angry. So he broke her neck and threw her out the window like a boy tossing out his toy. The evidence is indisputable. Soon, we'll solve the case. Now you, what do you have to say about it? Can I speak to Earl? No! You're going to plot an excuse with him, right? Do you think I'm so stupid? Do you? Fine. If you want to play a game, let's play. But you and your husband are going to live your worst nightmare! I swear I know nothing about it. But I can tell you this. That night, we were so shocked, so we rushed Auntie Par to the hospital. Go faster, I need to take a dump. The road is dark, it's dangerous. I can barely see anything. What's that? You hag! Your fart is rotten! I can taste it in my mouth! That wasn't me. Then who farted? Why are you looking at me? I didn't fart! Par. You're not dead, are you? Is she still breathing? She's still breathing. But it's me who can't breathe! Stop! Stop! Par! Her neck is all twisted! Will her nose get flattened? Sorry, ma'am. The road is closed. We have to go to the hospital. Someone's hurt back there. Who? What happened? - My aunt. She fell from the house. - Par! Par! She stinks. I think she'd been dead for weeks. You have to turn back and wait out the storm. It's a matter of life and death! We can't wait! I really can't let you pass. I'm doing my job. Go home and we'll see tomorrow. I'm waiting for the DNA results. If they match your sample, you'll spend the rest of your life in a Thai jail. You know, people in there hate granny-killers, especially a white man like you. I didn't do anything. I passed out. When I woke up, nobody was there. I came out of the house, but everybody was gone. Help me! Help me! Help me! Told you he gave you the wrong change. It was dark, I couldn't see. Help! What did you put in the whiskey? I'm so plastered. Please! Help me! If you drink and don't get drunk, go see a doctor. Help me! Please! Stop! That's sharp. - What? - Stop talking. June. Kai! See, is that a dog or a man? Told you he's not dead. Kai! My boy! My dear boy! Are you hurt? Is this a family drama? They used to hate each other's guts. We thought the white man had killed both of you! Who's "we"? Only you were acting so hysterical. What are you talking about? Why did you think we're dead? The white man has killed your aunt. Her body is in the car. What did you say, Mom? The white man killed Auntie Par? Now he's probably going to ambush us and kill us off one by one. Dad, stop talking nonsense! Who's going to kill who? Earl is sleeping upstairs. Kai, go check on June. Phet, take Auntie Par out of the car. Earl's not here! Dad! Mom! What? June is not in her room either! I can't find her. Oh, my God! He must have already killed June! My poor grandchild! Listen up. We'll have to hunt down the white man. Grab a weapon. He must be hiding somewhere in the field. He couldn't have gone far. Kai, take the pickup and find June. Go now! Earl. Earl. June! Where are you? Phet! You scared me. Sorry, I didn't mean to. Don't go yet. Stop it. I don't have time for this. Move! Sai, I just want to talk to you. About what? We have nothing to talk about. Give me another chance, please. Do you realize what you're doing? Move. I'm going to find my husband. Your husband won't live until tomorrow. The fortune-teller said his time is over. If he dies, I'm going to die too. Death is better than being your wife. You son of a bitch! Oh, really? I'll make your wish come true. THE EX-HUSBAND Good. Now you're being helpful. What do you mean? It means you've just given us a lead. If you had told me before, I would've concluded that your husband had a motive. What motive? The white man knew that you and Phet were going to get back together. Are you out of your mind? I never wanted to get back with that good-for-nothing! Well, he's dead. Who would want to be with him now? Look at this. Look. Look. Look. Look! Look! Look what you've done! Explain why your fingerprints are on these two guns. You killed Phet out of jealousy because you knew Sai was planning to get back with him. Sai already confessed everything. You tricked them to spread out to look for you. Then you killed them off, one by one. Am I right? Phet was your first victim. Then you found Kai's gun in the glove box. Then... The next victim was Kai. You enjoyed it, didn't you? Taking revenge with your own bloody hands. Let me tell you, I know what white pricks like you think. You pose as a rich man, dupe a local girl to marry you, and put her to work to support you! While you yourself do nothing, but fuck, smoke weed, and do drugs. I fucking hate white men like you! I hate you more than I hate the dung beetles in buffalo shit! I'll throw your white ass into jail, just watch me! DON KRATOK POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICE CAMERA FOOTAGE Play it from the beginning. Bung Klua Police Station. Police? Help, he's going to kill us! What? Who's going to kill who? The white man just killed my sister! Wait, where are you calling from? From Boonluck's farmhouse. Okay, Boonluck's house. The police are on their way. I'm hanging up. Play the clip from the body camera. Is this Boonluck's house? Is anyone here? I can speak Isan, sir. What's up, buddy? I mean... officer. A lady called us. She said something bad happened. How bad? A murder. A murder? Yes. White man, sorry. I'm lost. Do you know where Boonluck's farmhouse is? - Boonluck's farmhouse? - Yes. I know. Tukta! Darling! Gosh, why is he always shouting? So annoying. Good evening, officer. What's the matter? There's a murder at Boonluck's farmhouse. Boonluck's house? Shit! My daughter lives there! I'll take you there! Charlie, go! Which way now? Keep going straight. Who's lying on the road? It's Kai! My ex-husband! Is he dead? Oh, no. Come on. Stupid car. What do you expect from the government junk? You two wait here. I'll be right back. Lock the door. Gosh. Which way to Boonluck's farm? Is it this way? Wait. What's that? Major, sir? Yes. What's up? I'm out for an inspection at Boonluck's farmhouse. It's full of dead bodies. Dead bodies? How many? Two, sir. As of now. Can you handle that? I... I can, sir. Good. So don't call again, I'm sleeping. What the hell are you looking at? Keep watching. Am I on the right way? Why is it so far? Shit! That's it? The camera was broken, sir. Blockhead! Now I can't see shit! Go back! Go back! More! More! Stop! I got you, fucking white man. Earl. Sai. Sai! Sai! Shut the hell up! You're annoying. POL. MAJOR NAWAT BANLUECHA INSPECTOR (INQUIRY) Come in. POL. MAJOR NAWAT BANLUECHA INSPECTOR (INQUIRY) - What's up? - Sir. We've found new evidence in the field. New evidence? What is it? NEW EVIDENCE Why didn't you tell me about this before? I thought the phone was lost. Tell me what you saw that night so we can end this quickly. Actually, I saw everything. Everything, but you've told me nothing! I thought no one was going to believe me. All right, now tell me everything. Do not skip even one detail, understand? That night after I got the phone as a present, I went out and shot a video. Then I saw something. June! June! Where are you? I told you to go clean the toilet! June! Gosh. June! Who's that? I saw Grandpa screaming - like crazy. - No, I'm scared. Ghosts of ancestors, please don't hurt me! And then I saw my dad and Phet talking. They looked very drunk. I got the thing - as you told me to. - So I took a clip of them, just for fun. Here you go. Cool. What is it anyway? An insurance contract. An insurance contract. What insurance? Here, I found it. Look here. See it here? What? The beneficiary is the white man. Sai is the insured. "The insured"? "The beneficiary"? What do they even mean? You muttonhead. It means if the white man is dead, my sister, Sai, will get paid a million. But... The insurance agent told me the white man needed to sign it first. How can we make him sign? I don't know. But soon, I'll think of a way. Beats me. If I can't think of a way... I'll use this. Kai! Don't play with that! Put it away, someone will see us! - Damn it. - Idiot. Believe me, idiot. Look, no bullets. Don't be such a coward. Even so, just put it away. You don't know this song? Which song? A gun with no bullets can't kill a man A fiddle with no strings can't join a band A man with no looks can't stay Even a monk tells him to go away... What now? Power's out. Then I saw Uncle Earl comes out of the house. - Mr. Er! - Hey. Mr. Er! - Mr. Er! - Mr. Er! - Sure! - Right! Oh, right! - Your nam. - Right. Is it correct? It's "nam," I'm sure it's your nam. Give me your nam. I told you, it's your name. No, I was correct. It's your nam. - Idiot. - You don't know, I know. It's your name. Hey. Don't blame me. You stinking butthole. What's he doing? - No. Don't. - Don't do it! No! - No. Are you going to pound my head? - I'm sorry. Don't hurt me. Please, don't hurt me! I'm sorry! - Don't hit me! - Please stop! Don't hit me! Enough! Let me go! Stop it! The white man has gone mad! Run! Just run. - Hurry! - What's wrong with your old man? Beats me. Phet, we're out of whiskey. Let's go to Noi's store. Okay. Where's Kai's body? -Then I heard people talking -Outside. Covered in blood. -very loudly downstairs, -Go see it. - so I came down and took a clip. - Take me to see it. Auntie Par, please help me find the first aid kit. I couldn't find it. All right. Where is it? It's so dark here. Maybe in the closet... Hey, that's the white man's wallet. You're calling me a liar? Then where are those two? See, the truck is gone too. They've stolen the truck and run off. They're not dead. How do you know? Maybe the white man took the truck. Husband? Is that you? Husband? Par, you slut! You slept with someone else. - Please don't hurt me! I'm scared! - You left me to die. You're the only one I love. I will kill you! THE SECOND TO SEVENTH VICTIMS Just wait and see. If I see that white man again, I'll slaughter him like a dog. What's wrong? Did your balls hurt or what? Your sister's got a solid kick. What's that? Whose legs are those? Stop! Stop! We almost fell off the road! Let's check it. It's the white man. I was wondering where he was. Why is he lying here? What should we do with him? Listen... You watch him, make sure he doesn't move. I'll go get a rope to tie him. You watch him. Make sure he doesn't move. Hurry up. You're finished, damn white man. You white prick. Without you, Sai will come back to me. What the fuck? No! No! No! You're done for, white man! Phet! Phet! Where are you? Come and help me catch the white man! Phet was crushed by the truck. What? You killed Phet! Damn you! Please listen to me. White prick, I'll kill you! Gosh, you're going to shoot me with my own gun? Dumbass! It's fucking empty! Kai, you butthole! You're drunk and left your car just like this? What a useless slacker! I'm sick of my son! Great! You even left the keys here. Luckily, no one has stolen it. Stupid hag, why did you hit me? Sorry! I thought it was the white man. Have Phet and Kai come back? No. Just me here. But I've called the police. They should be here before long. Do you think the cop will come back for us? He was gone for just ten minutes. What the... Ten minutes? I thought he had gone for an hour. I'm so hungry. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Right. He might have a candy stashed somewhere. You halfwit! I mean, that gun! We can't eat a gun. Oh, right. The gun. I'm so sick of this fat idiot. What if the white man shows up? Don't say that, I'm scared already. Damn you! You scared the shit out of me! See, he's covered in blood. I've got an idea. I'll lure him out. You call him. When he comes out, I'll stab him. Help me. Help me, please. Help me. Help me, please. Help me, please. Help me. Help me... Motherfucker! What shall we do now? Why did you kill my husband? I'll call the cop and put you in jail! Charlie! Shit! Officer, I can speak Thai. Shut your mouth, don't talk. Walk! Dad, Mom. What happened to Tukta? Sai, where have you been? I was looking for June. I asked around, but nobody saw her. What happened to Tukta? What's with all this blood? She tripped and fell on my rake. But what is she doing here? I don't know. She and her husband suddenly barged in. - Charlie? Where is he? - Yes. Well, he's... We're screwed. Pull yourself together. What happened to Charlie? It's nothing. Doctors are very good these days, they can cure everything. Cure, my foot! His guts are all over the floor. He's dead! Keep walking. Stop. - Earl. - Stop right there. Step back! Now! I said, step back. Earl. Sai. Back away, everyone! What the hell is going on? The white man. He did it. Dad! Don't be ridiculous! It's true! He killed them. He killed my sister, Par, threw her down from the second floor, and broke her neck. Mom! Where is it? Where's your sister's body? Let me see. In the car. Holy shit! Ma'am, may you rest in peace. I'm sorry. Officer, be careful! That's my sister. Gosh, officer. You're ruining her beauty! Beautiful or not, she's as dead as a doornail. Her neck is twisted like a corkscrew. What about those two? Who killed them? You mean Tukta and her white husband? No. There are two men lying dead near the field over there. Oh, no! Two men? Is it Kai? I have no idea who they are. You white prick, you killed my son! You dog poop! - Sir. - Dad, no! Sir, no! What? What? What did he say? He said Phet was crushed by the truck and Kai shot himself. Can you take off his handcuffs? Please, officer. He's injured. All right. But he can't go anywhere. He's the prime suspect. He didn't kill anyone. I'm his wife, I know him. Stop, Sai. You blindly defend him as usual. For God's sake, he killed your own brother! That's right! Why are you so stupid? It's him, he's the murderer! - You see... - Stop! Shut up, everyone! So there are five bodies. The lady with the broken neck. Two men on the road. This woman here and her white husband. Where's the white man's body anyway? In the house. Don't move. Stay right here. Why is the gun here? Officer, listen to me. I was there when Charlie was killed... I saw... Sai! Tell your husband to shut up. He's a goddamn liar! He's talking shit! Sir, show me your feet. Dad! - I won't let you! - Watch out! Dad, don't do it! Sai. Sai. Sai. Watch out! Old man! Sai. The fortune-teller's prediction on my daughter will come true today. It will come true with your death, damn white prick! Put it down, ma'am. Jan! Jan! Jan! Jan! Jan! Jan! Jan, are you all right? No, don't do this to me. Wake up, old hag! Wake up! Dad, Mom, help me! Don't... Take your husband home. All charges have been withdrawn. Earl is innocent. Gosh. You changed your mind so quickly. We have new evidence. What about my mom and my niece? Your mom ran away from the hospital. Where did she go? How would I know? She must fear being caught for killing an officer. Mom... Wait. What about June? It's your niece who saved your husband's ass. June. One last question. Do you remember what you bought that day from the market? Yes, I do. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE MAGIC MUSHROOM Is this what you bought? What is it? It's nothing. All right, you can go home now, girl. Bye, sir. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE MAGIC MUSHROOM THE CASE TURNS UPSIDE DOWN? June is nothing but a burden. I will talk to the lawyer. I will give her up to Tukta to get it over with. Don't tell Sai. She won't let us do that. How is June doing? How is she doing? She's fine because I feed her. They made a baby and now it's my burden to raise it. Don't be so mean. Gosh, it's pretty. What is it, Jamie? My dad calls them magic mushrooms. When he eats them, he starts doing weird things. This soup is damn tasty. It's spicy as hell. It's awesome. - You made it very delicious. - So good. Who's that? Please don't hurt me! I'm scared. Damn, the power's still not back. The plates are in... Go! - All right. - Put it in the back of the truck. Let's go! I think this will do. I'll open it. Whose legs are those? Stop! Stop! You white prick. Without you, Sai will come back to me. What the fuck? Dad, Mom, help me! Don't... Stop! What's the hurry? You forgot your phone. Thank you. POLICE STATION FOR THE PEOPLE June! Auntie Sai! Sir, the blood results have just come in. We found a substance in all the blood samples. It's psilocybin, a psychoactive substance found in magic mushrooms. It causes hallucinations. When consumed excessively, it drives you berserk. If a lot of people eat it at the same time, it may induce collective hallucinations. We ran a test on scraps of food in their stomachs. The mushrooms were mixed in the soup they had for dinner that night. I believe it was the cause of everything that followed. Yes, sir. I'll write up a report for you. POL. MAJOR NAWAT BANLUECHA INSPECTOR (INQUIRY) What are you scribbling? It's nothing, sir. Let me see. I said, give it to me!
