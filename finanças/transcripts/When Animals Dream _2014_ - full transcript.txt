Have you ever had any other rashes? No. You've never had anything like this. Dizziness? Sight problems? Anything like that? No. Ok. If you want you can remove your blouse. Yes, this way I can better examine you. Please open wide... Thank you. Now let's take a look at your gums. Alright. You're certain you haven't experienced any other symptoms? Yes. Now lie on your stomach, please. All right. It's probably nothing, but I still think... we should check on you again in about a month from now. - Is that all? - Yes. You don't need to talk to my secretary. I'll schedule it myself. Hello, darling. - Can I take mom with me now. - Yes. Yes, but don't take long. She's a bit tired today. Sure. This is the last bite. Will you do the dishes? I'll go look after your mother. Thank you, darling. Hello, Marie. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Shall we take a look around? - Yes. So this is the work area. You'll get the hang of it pretty soon. We still have enough ice to keep working. You'll have to take the fish scraps outside yourself, because you were late today. It's always like that. I'll show you the storage area later. Felix? - Please, can you look after Marie? - Yes. - Hello, Felix. - Hello. - Can I wear these? - Yes. I'll show you. - There. - Thank you. Right here. Careful or you'll fall, friend. Esben, stop that. Thank you. He can do that himself. Welcome, Marie. Here, Marie. The apron and your own knife. Welcome. Hey, darling. You're earlier today. How was work? - I cut myself. - Can I take a look? It was nothing. We can take a look at that. Dr. Larsen is here. It's alright. So... You're mother is not feeling very well today. The scars from the injections have swollen up. - That's why I called Dr. Larsen. - Shall we have a look? I've been using the same arm this last month. One whole month? Well then... You'll want to inject in a different part of the body each time. Also... stop injecting in this arm until it gets better. So there's no infection? - No. - If you say so... Marie, can you come here and give us a hand? There. There. There. There. Can you give him a hand? Your name is Marie, right? How do you know? I heard Esben call you that. Esben is an idiot. He is one of the big idiots. So... I'm Daniel. Hello, Marie. Are you still mad about the welcome dip? Huh? Are you an idiot? Or are you retarded like your mother? What was that? - Esben knocked his glass off the table. - Did he? Then you'll have to clean up, boy. Now. Do you want some? No, thank you. How are things with your mom? She's fine. Come here! There, there. Easy, easy. Oh my! I think we caught ourselves a lobster. - Is it a lobster? - Have you tried a sailor yet? How about you get on your knees? Come now. - Force her down! - No! Hold her. Take a look at this here. I have something for you. Now, look here. Look at me. - This is for you. - Help! No one can hear you. Hold her. - No! - Look at him! Open your eyes. Come on, give it a kiss. Yes. Kiss it. Marie? Is everything alright? Are you ok? Yes, yes. Hey. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Is that your mother? Hello. Daniel. You look like her. Can I have my hand back? We have to keep going. What are you doing this evening? Maybe we could do something. I can't. Ok. Maybe some other day then. Yeah, maybe. What are you doing? Stop. Stop that. What the hell is really wrong with her? It's alright, honey. Marie? Honey? Honey? What's wrong? There's no doubt about it. All of the symptoms are there. Yes, yes. I hear you. I can't hide it anymore. - You haven't said anything? - Of course not. Marie? Are you still upstairs? Well. Can't we wait a while longer? - But we have to do something. - Marie. - Come and sit down. - Actually, I'm going out. I called Dr. Larsen, so you'll have to wait. Come. Dr. Larsen is here to talk to you about your affliction. The truth is this affliction has already begun to change you. We know because of your mother's case that there is a high chance... that it will progress even further with you and that there'll be excessive growth of hair in you body. And it's not just that. There will also be psychological changes. You will become more irritable and agressive. That's why I recommend that you take your medication. - I don't need any medication. - Listen. No, you listen. You can ask the doctor to force it down my throat. I'm not taking any medication. Understand? Felix? - What do you need? - I have to ask you something. So? There's a rusty old ship at the docks. Do you know who owns it? It belonged to some russians, I think. Do you know where they are now? What do you think? They're in Russia drinking vodka. So, you don't know if my mom has been aboard that ship? Ok. Your mom was beautiful, but people were afraid of her. The same way they are afraid of you, Marie. But let's not talk about that. Wanna go dancing? Hey. Can you pour me a "cuba libre", please? A beer for me, thanks. I'm quite close to becoming a monster. I only need some time so as to have as much sex as I can before that. Do you think you could help me? Faster, Daniel! Come on. What a cool place. You're beautiful. What's that? - Marie? - I want you to go now. Don't touch me. You have to go. Hey, it's alright. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. Come. Aren't you ready? - Dad! - Don't worry, honey. Keep calm. - You have to keep her arm straightened out. - Fine! - Keep calm. It's nothing. - Let me go. - It's nothing. - Lie still. Yes, that's it. Come on! Mom... Mom, help me. Sit up. Mom, sit up. Come on. Sit up. Here. You can... You can go to bed now. I'll tidy up. Was it like this with the russians too? They did something to her. Didn't they? - So she attacked and killed them. - Yes. - Good morning. - Good morning. Dr. Larsen has gone missing. - What? - Yes. Have you seen him? No. Have you heard anything? - No, nothing. - And your wife? Well, she's sitting in her chair. You didn't talk with him yesterday? No, I think it's been more than a week since I last spoke with him. His wife says he was here yesterday. Does she? Do you think she's lying? I don't think she is lying. But she must be making a mistake. Thor, we had an agreement. But this has nothing to do with my wife. You don't mind if we come in and take a look, do you? Is it really necessary? - We need to make sure. - Yeah. We need to see her without clothes. Will you help me with your mom? - You knew? - Yes. The nightgown. Check the nails. And her gums. What the hell are you laughing about? Do you think that's funny? I have my eye on you too, Marie. You got that? Mom? Mom? Mom? No. No. Hey. I'll take that. - Coffee? - Yes, please. Coffee, dad? I think you should go home now. No, I don't think so. Anyone else want some coffee? - The gentleman just wants a coffee. - Yes, and he already has one. Coffee over here? Anyone? Come. Don't do that. Stop! If you're going out like that, then there's nothing I can do for you. Marie. No. Marie! Come here! Marie! Bye, bye. Thank you for today. Hey! She's here! Felix, open up! Felix! Marie? Marie? Marie, you have to wake up now. You have to wake up. You have to get out of here. They're after you. What's going on? Do you remember what happened? You attacked and killed Esben. Quiet. Lie down. Stay here until I can get a boat. Then I'll come get you. And then we sail far away from here. How about that? You're beautiful. Marie. There's nothing to be done. Daniel? - Do we have some rope? - I'll go find some. What the hell was that? Daniel? No! Daniel? Daniel? Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. Station responding to mayday. Lyngby Radio listening. Lyngby Radio listening. Can you state your position? Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. Marie! Marie. Marie. - Daniel? - Yes. I'm here. I'm here.
