# There's a castle in our dreams # Where we pin our hopes # And all our fancies # Where the light of romance beams # And sweethearts come a-wooing # Under your window cooing... # I tell you we ought to be around the tradesman's entrance. SHE LAUGHS Don't make me laugh. Can you imagine Mrs Herman Vincent in the kitchen? This has to be delivered to her personally. One family tree, and don't pick any plums off it, Irene. I suppose you mean lemons. Good morning. Madam. I've called from Dixon's about your upholstery. It's customary in these matters to use the tradesman's entrance. Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. Uh, but I have also to deliver this parcel to Mrs Herman Vincent personally. Mrs Vincent is not in the habit of receiving tradespersons in her boudoir. I have my instructions. I'm the accredited representative of Mrs Herman Vincent. I'll undertake to deliver this parcel personally. I was told that I... Kindly take a seat over there. Hey, what's the idea? You're supposed to be around at the trademans' entrance. Don't tell me. Tell Miss O'Dare. She knows everything. I can't think what it can be... a map... Oh, it's my tree! Oh, isn't it beautiful, Mary? But, madam, a tree that bears little white fruit with names on it? What kind of a tree is that? A family tree, Mary, that shows that Mr Vincent's family were founded by Nevin Devansant. Devansant sounds French, madam. "Norman," Betherton, "Norman." He came over with William The Conqueror, you know. It's a beautiful tree. Hang it up in the mural room. Where everyone can see it. What should I do with the young person from Dixon's, madam? Well, you don't expect me to see her, do you? Tell her that the cushions are all wrong - that they're not broad enough. "Broad enough," madam? Yes, broad enough - where you sit down. In the beam? Yes, in the beam. Now, listen, Don. I met Madame Lucy in Paris last summer. You don't say? Oh, no. Nothing like that. No, I told her if she ever opened up in New York, she'd have no trouble in finding capital here. In fact, I almost guaranteed it. That's kind of you, Bob, as long as it isn't my capital. BOB: What in the world is that? Your family tree, sir. Mother's certainly going places. Would it disturb you, sir, if I allowed a young person from Dixon's to come in and examine the upholstery? Not a bit. Now, listen, Don, how would you like... How about a game of ping-pong? All right. Psst. Psst. You see, these cushions don't come out far enough. Mrs Vincent wants them broader in the beam. Oh, sure, they'll flatten out when they're sat on. We always make them like that. Yes, but Mrs Vincent wants them broader in the beam. What is this, a marathon? HE CHUCKLES LIGHTLY Did you order my breakfast, Bob? Oh, sorry. ...Then if Mrs Vincent isn't satisfied, we'll do them over entirely. I'm afraid you'll do them over entirely. You see, Mrs Vincent wants them broader in the beam. Betherton. Yes, sir. Oh, er, Miss Worth will have her breakfast on the veranda. (What's she doing here?) Mrs Vincent was not satisfied with the cushion, sir. Betherton, you surprise me. Quite, sir. You have a nice swim? Mmm. I'm hungry as a wolf. MUSIC PLAYS If you please, would you be so kind as to sit in that chair for me? Delighted. Now, would you get up, please? Ah, as I thought. I suppose you wouldn't care to tell me what this is all about, would you? Oh, the shop sent me down about the fit of the cushions. Mrs Vincent was not satisfied. Oh, I see. Course the customer's always right. Well, that's our stock joke at the shop, sir. Yeah. Oh, can I do anymore sitting down for you? There's another chair here. Oh, no, thanks. I just needed someone heavy to prove a point to myself. Oh, thank you. Oh, sure, I didn't mean you were too heavy. I'm glad of that. Would you like a cigarette? I should look fine smoking if Mrs Vincent came in. I don't think there's much chance of that. I don't think she's even had her breakfast yet. She's not had her breakfast? Here am I starving for my lunch. Excuse me, please, sir. This is for Miss Worth, sir. I shall see that she gets it, Betherton. Luncheon is served. For you. For me? Said you were hungry, didn't you? Oh, sure. Well, dive into it. Do you think it would be all right? I'll give you my personal guarantee. Well, that's mighty kind of you. I think I will. You're very quiet. I guess I just want my breakfast. Let's dance. It's fun dancing with you, Bob. You're Irish, aren't you? How ever did you guess that? Well, I don't know. I think it must be something about the way you talk. Ah, you should have heard me when I first came over. I did have quite a brogue then. You still have a little. Sure. This is a little different from my usual lunch. Oh, and what is your usual lunch? Mostly ham sandwich, glass of milk - at the cafe next to the shop. I was measuring the chairs, and I looked up, and there standing before me was the most... Don't look now, but it's himself. Don't look around. He'll know we're talking about him. Ask him to sit here. He's coming this way. If he sits down here, we'll beat it. Well, fancy meeting you here. Well, fancy. Oh, er, won't you sit down? No, I won't intrude, thank you. Oh, you're not intruding. Helen and I, we just finished. HELEN: Why, yes. See you tonight, Irene. Yes. Come on, Jane. Won't you sit down? Well, yes, thank you. DON: Pleasant surprise. Three ham sandwiches. Friends of yours? Uh, yes, my best friends. Oh, isn't he handsome? He's too handsome for me. I like them tougher. Well, can't they be both? You know, they say it's the hottest April in 31 years. Do they? They do. I suppose in Ireland, you'd call my being here a strange coincidence. Yes, we would. Well, it isn't. I came here especially to see you. To see me? Mm-hmm. Did you ever hear of a dressmaker called Madame Lucy? You mean the one from Paris that all the society-people are going to? Mm-hmm. Oh, sure, I've heard of her. Well, how would you like a job modelling dresses for Madame Lucy? How would you like a job shovelling up gold in the streets. HE CHUCKLES But I'm serious. Yes, so am I. Modelling dresses(!) Why, I couldn't get a job like that, not unless I had a pull. Well, I have a certain amount of pull. But with Madame Lucy? Mm-hmm, with Madame Lucy. Now, look here, you take this card and present it, and I think I can promise that you'll get a job. No fooling. No fooling. Oh, that is kind of you Mr... Marshall. Donald Marshall. HE PLAYS JOLLY TUNE ON THE ACCORDIAN Granny! Hi, darling. The most wonderful thing has happened. I'm going to get the finest job - at least maybe I am. Well, isn't it a fine job you got already? Oh, but this is modelling dresses. Modelling dresses? Uh-huh. It's the work of the devil. You'll do no such thing. Oh, Granny. Now, now, now, don't argue with me. I've seen those naked hussies in the movies. That's no work for a decent girl, let alone a grandchild of mine. No. Granny, you don't see... Oh, no, I don't see. I've only lived for 76 years, keeping me eyes wide open. But it's the most elegant shop, and the grandest people go there. Say, don't forget that sometimes the grandest people are the greatest riffraff. Oh, Granny, don't you want me to get on in the world? Sure, I do, but not that way. There's a string to it. Now, listen, I know this... You know whatever you want to believe. Yes, yes, I know. Granny, am I an O'Dare? Sure, you are. What of it? Haven't you always told me that the O'Dares have second sight? Second sight - that's all hooey. You speak about what you understand, Michael O'Dare! Hooey, is it?! Let me tell you something. Brian O'Malley's wife - she was born an O'Dare. The day her husband died, saw his body floating in the air without a head... How did she know it was her husband if he didn't have a head? Aw, you... Helen. Jane. The most wonderful thing is going to happen. Oh, he was so handsome. Oh, well, never mind about him. What's happening? I'm going to get a job modelling dresses. Modelling dresses? Mm-hmm. Where? At Madame Lucy from Paris, France. Oh, no, no, no, no. You go woolly-footed, you know. Walk with dignity. Don't stomp around on your heel. Try it again. Try it again. It's protruding too far behind. Keep it in. Keep it in. SHE SPEAKS FRENCH Madame. SHE SPEAKS FRENCH Monsieur Smith, Mrs Herman Vincent is in. Mrs Herman Vincent. This is an extraordinary pleasure, madame. Extraordinary. My son Robert tells me that I must get something here, that you have wonderful things. Oh, we think so. What may we show you? Evening dresses. Yes. SHE SPEAKS FRENCH Get out of that dress. Quick! Would you ask me again? And say "please"? Will you get out of that... I will not! And will you keep your hands to yourself? I suppose you'd like to show it to Mrs Herman Vincent yourself. Why, that's a grand idea! I think I will. Ha ha ha! ALL LAUGH Maybe I'll surprise the lot of you. And maybe you'll surprise yourself and fall down on that Irish pan of yours. LAUGHTER Smith, madame. With an I or a Y? An "I." Just an I. I'm giving a ball at my house next month. A ball, madame? How very interesting. Oh, a great ball for a charity. Princess Minetti is the chairman, and Mrs Newlands Grey is on the board. It's really very flattering that they wanted poor little me to give it at my house. Oh, not at all. What is the meaning of this? SHE GASPS It's very gorgeous - too gorgeous, I'm afraid. It would wipe out poor little me. FRENCH ACCENT: No, no, madame. How could that be? Did all her fine clothes wipe out Madam Du Barry? Oh, Madam Du Barry - how funny you should've said that. I once went to a fancy ball as Du Barry. SHE SPEAKS FRENCH Mr Smith, what do you think this dear child was just saying to me? I can't imagine. That I was like Madam du Barry. Ha ha ha. So utterly silly, but I think I will take that dress. I think it's my type. How clever of you to have little French mannequins. French, madame? HE SPEAKS FRENCH FAKE FRENCH ACCENT: Pardon, monsieur? Ah, oui, oui, Mr Smith. IRENE: I've done it, girls. I've done it. Sold to Mrs Herman Vincent. What? Mm-hmm. SHE SPEAKS FRENCH She was wonderful, mademoiselle. Mr Marshall, this business must have publicity. That's why I've asked you to come here today. Oh, yes, publicity. Yes, I see. Tell me, Mr Smith, how is this girl, O'Dare, shaping? Well, she's still a little woolly-footed, you know, but she has... Ha! Ha! I've got a number of ideas. What would you say to taking one of our best hotels for a fashion parade, you know? I can just see the great staircase now with the giant spotlights on it and the glorious procession of our best models. I don't like the sound of that, Smith. No? No. Excuse me. Mr Robert Vincent to see you. Oh, come in, Robert. Hello, mother. Hello, darling. You're early. How clever of you to have unearthed Madame Lucy. See, I thought you'd like her style. Like her? Oh, she's tout a fait soignee. Ooh, la, la. Quel chic, n'est-ce pas? What do you call it, mademoiselle? Oh...well... Lady Audacious, madame. Oh, it's too ravishing. I think it will do something to me. I'll have that. Oh, merci, madame. Mother, I'm going to have a word with Madame Lucy. I'll wait for you outside. I'd like to meet her, Robert. Well, I'll arrange that. No, I think that is a good idea. Yes? Yes, Mr Smith. Madame Lucy in? Oh, come in, Bob. And Mrs Vincent's charity ball would be ideal. Smith, you're quite right. Bob, he's got a great idea. Oh, yeah? The charity ball of Mrs Vincent. My idea will be to buy a ticket for all our models. And then I would instruct them to behave just like the other guests, no, possibly a little better. Charming. Yes, quite. But the point is, they'd be so exquisitely dressed that everyone will go around asking, where did that gown come from or that one? And the answer will always be the same, from Madame Lucy. Mr Smith, what makes you think my mother would subscribe to a publicity stunt? She need never know anything about it. Well, how about it? No, I don't like it. Now, the old lady hasn't been so keen about anything for years. But, Bob, this will absolutely make the ball. Lovely girls and lovely dresses, why, it'll make it go just like that. Wait a minute. You mean all the girls from Madame Lucy will be there? Mm-hmm. All of them? Yes, all of them. On second thought, it is a grand idea. It will make the ball go just like that. 'Twas a little bit of French, 'twas a little dash of blarney, and the right kind of customer. We call them clients. Call them what you like. Had I know this job was going to be this easy, I'd never have taken it. WOMAN: Madame? Right here. Oh, no, no. Not you, Lillian. Take it off. Let Irene wear it. What? Mrs Vincent insists on having Irene. She says she's lucky to her. Mrs Vincent's waiting. Tout de suite. Oh, sure, Mr Smith. I thought I heard you say, there was something comic about a man who interests himself in women's clothes. A man can change his mind, can't he? Oh, yes, or a girl can change it for him. Is that supposed to be a crack? Oh, I just thought Miss O'Dare might have had something to do with it. Why, no. I'm relieved to hear it. Oh, really? Why relieved? Because I've just dated her up myself. You what? So long, Lucy old girl. # There's a castle # In our dreams # Where we place # Our hopes # And all our fancies # Where the light # Of romance # Beams # And sweethearts come # A-wooing under # Your window cooing... # Who's young Vincent got a hold of? # Our world is his # Climb the stairway # To the castle of... # She looks as though he found her in a bargain basement. She surely got him interested. Eleanor had better watch her step. You know, you dance so well you make me feel like an elephant. Why, you're not so bad. I love it. I get it from my mother. Was your mother a great dancer? Oh, sure. She was on the stage so was my father. He came over with the Irish plays. He was a fine actor, but he took pneumonia and died in three days. Oh, that's terrible. Well, they do say, pneumonia is hard on those that drink. He drank? Well, he was not exactly what you'd call a drinking man. But when they gave him alcohol for medicine, it was no great surprise to his system. I'm sure the little leprechaun must have been sitting on me shoulder right there the day I went down to fix the chairs for Mrs Vincent. Who'd have thought within three weeks, I'm modelling dresses for Madame Lucy, and I'm dining and dancing with Mr Robert Vincent himself. Well, the little whatever it is must have been on my shoulder, too. Oh, listen, Bob. That's my favourite tune. What's it called? You've Got Me Out On A Limb. Oh, I'm glad to hear that. That's the name of the tune, Mr Vincent. Will you dance it with me at the ball? Oh, sure. You know, I've never been to a ball before. Then we'll have to see that we give you a good time. I get that excited every time I think about it. 'Tis the loveliest dress in the whole shop and the most expensive, and Mr Smith gave it to me to wear. Oh, it's a beautiful dress, entirely. They call it, the flaming rosebud. They have a name for every dress. Well, what do you think of that? Lillian, you know, the sharp-tongued viper I told you about, she thought it ought to be given to her to wear. "I always model the flaming rosebud," says she. Telling a lie, for many's the time I've shown it meself. "No," says Mr Smith right to her face. "No, I think it would look better shown on Irene." Good for him. "Irene," he says, "You look a million dollars "in the flaming rosebud." Just like that. I wish you could have seen the look on her face. Well, now, just as a matter of curiosity, what would a dress like that be costing? Oh, 450. Glory be. 450 bucks? I could see over 200 ball games in box seats for that. And a girl puts it on her back in a dress. Michael O'Dare, it's none of your business. Now, you go on. Get out on the fire escape and go upstairs and tell the girls supper's ready. Look, Granny. Well, now that he's gone, I don't mind telling you. It's an outrageous price to pay for a dress. It's beautiful, of course, but look how flimsy the material is. Oh, when your dear dead mother was acting, you ought to have seen her dresses and the material they were made of. Oh, satins and brocades. Why, they'd stand up all by themselves and last a lifetime. Oh, well, who wants a dress to last a lifetime nowadays, Granny? A new season, a new dress. That's just why I don't like this job for you. With your imagination, you're beginning to think that real lace on your underwear and Herman on your back are the bare necessities of life. And then where will you be? Just where I am now, Granny, with you taking all the wind out of me sails. GRANNY CHUCKLES Blarney. Well, I'll go and dish up the stew. SHE HUMS TO HERSELF Hello. Hi, Irene. SHE SNIFFS Mmm. Irish stew... and dumplings. Is this your dress for the ball, Irene? Do you like it? It's the most beautiful dress I ever saw. Oh, my, it's soft. You're lucky to have a job like yours, Irene. I get so sick of selling perambulators. I get so sick of babies. I hate babies. Jane McGee! Don't you ever let me hear you say a thing like that again. Irene, would you let me try it on just for a minute? Why, sure. You'll do no such thing. The very idea. 450 bucks! THEY LAUGH SCREAMING Oh! Oh! Oh, Janie! Are you burnt? No, but the dress! The dress! I told you not to do it! Now you see what you've done! Well, crying isn't going to mend matters! Granny, don't. It wasn't Janie's fault. No. It was her vanity and your foolishness. No ball for you tonight, my fine lady. And all our supper gone! Oh, Janie, don't cry. Perhaps I can do something about it. Maybe it'll wash out. 450. JANE SOBS SHE SOBS Colonel and Mrs Punsenburg. Captain and Mrs Wayne Beaver. The Honourable and Mrs Tillinghurst-Tople. Lord Calfold of Ditchling. Mr Smith. Your Royal Highness. Mrs Grey. Madam, may I venture to say, how successful, how charming the effect is, if I may be so bold. Oh, yes, you may. The beauty of a lovely woman is music when in raiment nobly planned. Oh, how poetical. Our girls look nice, don't they? Mm-hmm. You didn't happen to see Miss O'Dare, did you? I thought you had no interest in Miss O'Dare. Oh, on the contrary, a very special interest. The fact is, she's wearing our best model, the flaming rosebud. I decided - or, rather, Smith decided that she was the best girl to show it off. Well, I don't think she's here. I haven't noticed her. Then she's not here. I'll let you in on a little secret. It came from Madame Lucy. Yes, I know. You should send all your friends there, Mr.. Smith. Oh, Smith with a Y I suppose. No, no. Smith with an I. Oh, well, we can't all be Smith with a Y, not in this workaday world. No. Well, I... I think I'll go and have a drink. See you later. Evening, Freddie. Good evening, Mr Vincent. There's a song I want you to sing. Sorry. Programme's been handpicked by Mrs Vincent with strict orders against any changes. Now, look, the song I want you to sing is You've Got Me Out On A Limb. Do you know it? Yes. And I'd love to sing it for you, but, unfortunately, we didn't bring the music. I've got the music. Oh. When do we sing it? I'll give you the signal. All right. And sing it in B flat. Irene isn't here. Well, what are we supposed to be? Nurses? Kept the car waiting for 20 minutes, and she never showed up. You should have carried out my instructions. Where do you think she could be? I don't know. Maybe she's taken the flaming rosebud out for the evening. BOTH: Where's Miss O'Dare? I don't know. Isn't she coming? I don't know. Why not? Well, the Irish are a very peculiar race, Mr Marshall. Miss O'Dare was supposed to leave with the other girls, and she just didn't turn up, so the other girls had to come without her. But she might have had an accident. Oh, I hope not. She's wearing our flaming rosebud. Well, why didn't you telephone? What's her number? Your name, madam? Miss Irene O'Dare. Miss Irene O'Dare. And last but not least - Miss O'Dare. The Princess Minetti. Mrs Newlands Grey. What an extraordinary dress. It's rather attractive. Why do I feel that we've met before? What is it that you suggested to me? Are you by any chance a relative of my old friend Lady O'Dare of castle O'Dare? Well, 'tis the same family. That's it, of course, Ireland. That's where we met - the Dublin horse show. You seem very interested. Do you know her? Why, yes. She's a friend of Don's. Oh, Bob, dear, I must have a cocktail. Fancy, Emily, this child is a relation of dear Bridget's. Well, now that you tell me, there is a look of Bridget about the eyes. Well, I'm glad you think so. When did you hear from Bridget last? Have I - have I heard? No. Well... DON: Why, Miss O'Dare, this is a surprise. Oh, Mr Marshall, didn't you know... Why, yes, the duke and duchess told me you were coming to New York, but I hardly expected to find you here. Well, why shouldn't you expect to find her here? Well, you see, Miss O'Dare is a very much sought after person. I think her presence here is quite a feather in your bunt. They're rolling in money. Of course. She's one of the O'Dares. They own half of Ireland. How about a drink? Fine. If you're here alone, perhaps you'd care to stay with us for a few days. Oh, that's very kind of you, but I'm staying with my grandmama. Grandmother? I don't seem to recall... She must be on the maternal side. Oh, yes. She had five. Miss O'Dare, would you care to dance? Oh, I'd be delighted. Well, you wouldn't mind if I stole her for a moment, would you? Charming. Well, did you hear that? Before I knew where I was, that princess had almost made me a relation. Yes, I heard. I just about got you out of it in time. What ever happened to you? I thought you weren't coming. Mr Marshall, I'm in terrible trouble. Really? If you've any pull with Madame Lucy, now's the time to use it. Why? What's the matter? Her beautiful dress is destroyed entirely, a whole saucepan of Irish stew down it. Oh. Well... MAN: Sorry. I don't notice anything. This isn't Madame Lucy's dress. Oh, it isn't? Then I wouldn't worry. It's much prettier. Oh, how'd you know that? How do I know it? Well... I think it's the prettiest dress I ever saw. Do you? Yes. It was my mother's when she played Lady Isabel. Lady Isabel? You know, in East Lynne. MUSIC STOPS APPLAUSE I think we'll sit this one out. # You've got me climbing # Way out on a limb... # Bob, let's have this dance. It's my favourite tune. Your favourite tune? Mm-hmm. Good. # Just in reach of a peach # Hope you'll pardon my falling for you # You've got me out on a limb # There you are tempting me... # Listen. Frogs. No, no, no. Not frogs. Is that a nightingale? Oh, I've always wanted to hear a nightingale. No, no. The orchestra. Oh, that? That's my favourite tune. Yes, I know. Listen to the words. Mr Marshall, would you tell me something? Anything. When do they eat here? Oh, how can you talk about eating when they're playing such - how can you? # I'm caught in a strange situation # Don't look at me that way and frown # There's no time for deep meditation... # Oh, I'm so hungry. My word, weren't you hungry the first time I met you here? Yes, I was, wasn't I? Yeah. It must be the air. Yes, it must. Let's do something about it. # Like the birds # Lost for words # In a tree... # You see, Mr Marshall, me supper was ruined with me dress. I've not had a bite since me lunch. We'll soon fix that. Now, you sit right there and don't move. And remember, if anyone tries to claim it, this is our dance, and we're sitting it out, Miss Irene O'Dare... of castle O'Dare. Oh, congratulations, Smith. That's a hot one. Hot or cold, Mr Marshall, we did not design that. Well, don't tell anyone. It's marvellous. But can you tell me, please, where Miss O'Dare did get that dress? Yes. Madame Lucy. Madame Lucy? Madame Lucy. Well, what happened to the other one? It got involved in an accident with some Irish stew. Our flaming rosebud? Our flaming rosebud. Oh, the dear child is alone. My dear Miss O'Dare. I know just what you're thinking. My cushions don't fit my chairs. Oh, no. I was thinking how beautifully they are made. No, no. They should be broader in the... Oh, no, Mrs Vincent. You always - I mean, they're always made like that. You see, they would sag over later on if they were made any broader in... ...in the beam. How clever of you to know about upholstery. Oh, 'tis just a hobby. Yes, Betherton, you're right. But I understand "discretion" is your middle name. Mr Marshall, if butlers told all they knew, society would be a shambles. And now, my dear, you really must tell us where you got that dress. Oh, 'tis but an old thing. I suppose it's in Paris. We just haven't got it over here yet. But who made it? You must tell us. Madame Lucy, of course. Madame Lucy? But she never showed it to me. I don't think you'll find Don taking much interest in women's clothes, mother. May I have this dance, Miss O'Dare? Well, I was just going to have a little something to... Yes, I will have this dance. Will you hold that for me, please? I'm always being rescued just in time. A sweet child, Mrs Vincent, and so like her aunt. Oh, yes. Dear, dear Lady O'Dare. Will you excuse me, please? Did you hear what he was telling them about the old dress? It came from Madame Lucy. Never mind about him. You know, I thought we were never going to get a dance together. It's been such an exciting evening. Mr Vincent was delighted in the way you sang that song, Freddie. And he'd like you and the boys to have a drink. Thank you, Mr Marshall. Now. BOB: Oh, what's happened to the orchestra? I think they're going to get an early supper, old boy. This is yours, Miss O'Dare. Oh, my, that looks good. Thanks for the lovely dance, Mr Vincent. Thank you. It was short but sweet. It was, wasn't it? Ham sandwiches. Yes, I'm afraid I forgot the milk. Do you think it's all right for me to be with you so much, Mr Marshall? Seems all right to me. Do you object? Oh, no. But you don't think Madame Lucy might like it better if I mix with the others a bit? On the contrary, I think she'd object strongly. Do you know her as well as all that? Oh, my word, yes. I've known her ever since she was so high. Inseparable, just like that. Oh. What's she like? Oh, rather tall, dark. Very good looking, I suppose. Some people seem to think so. You do, of course. Well, mind you, as long as it's all between us, we're just good friends. Oh. What does she mean by coming here in an old dress like that? Who does she think she is, anyway? What a marvellous idea. I wonder who designed it? If you're referring to Miss O'Dare's dress, that's one of Madame Lucy's creations. It expresses the careless rapture of our mother's day, don't you think? I thought I does. Yes. Madame Lucy's going to call it, Alice blue gown. You know, we never see Madame Lucy in the shop. Do you think you could arrange for me to talk to her about me dress? Well, I'm afraid not for a little while. I'm going away in the morning. Oh, you're going far away? Bermuda. That's a long way, isn't it? Yes. Nice for you. Well, that's what I thought when I made the plans. The orchestra are having their drink after the dance. Oh, really? Irene... Let's dance. You know, Miss O'Dare, I'm pretty dumb. Oh, what do you mean by that? Well, I've been dancing with you the whole evening, and I just found out you can dance, but dance. You're pretty good yourself. What say we sneak away from this mob? Yes. Come on. Shall we finish our dance or would you rather watch the floor show? It was nice of you to drive me all the way home like this. Well, I had to beat don to it. Do you realise he had every dance with you tonight? Did he? I didn't count. Oh, I'm afraid you're tired. No, I'm not tired. I'm just thinking. Pleasant thoughts? Just trying to hold on to this night. Hold on to it? It's the greatest night in me life. There'll never be another like it. Oh, yes, there will. Plenty more. Well, just in case. Well, good night. Good night. And thank you, Bob. Nice fellow - Bob. Salt of the Earth. Oh, where in the world did you come from? Around the corner. But I mean, what are you doing here? Well, I was down in the docks, and I thought it'd be rather nice if I came to say, goodnight to you. Why, I'm glad you did. So am I. Well...good night. Of course, I suppose you know the docks are on the east river and not the Hudson. Oh, yes. # I once had a gown # It was almost new... # Is it yourself or a ghost? # The daintiest thing # It was sweet Alice blue... # Did they laugh at the old gown? # What with little forget-me-nots # Placed here and there... # Heaven be praised. # When I had it on # I walked on the air... # Oh, but tell me what happened? # Granny, dear # It was swell that's not all... # Darling. # Your Irene # Was the belle of the ball... # You know I never had a doubt of it. BOTH: Irene! # In my sweet # Little # Alice blue gown # When I first wandered down # Into town # I was both proud # And shy # As I felt every eye # And in every shop window # I'd primp # Passing by # Then in manner of fashion # I'd frown # And the world seemed to smile # All around # As a treasure # I'll store it # I'll always # Adore it # My sweet little # Alice blue # Gown. # "That's all today. "See you tomorrow." I suppose it was worth all the trouble, Betherton. Why, I'd hardly say that, madam. But still it was a great success. Miss O'Dare seems to have got away with it. What an extraordinary expression, Betherton. I mean, she ran away with all the notices, madam. Well, after all, it only reflects credit on the hostess. I invited her, you know. Yes, madam. I knew she was slipping into New York incognito. Did you, madam? Yes. There isn't much I don't know, Betherton. Well, of course, madam. Yes. Madame Lucy seems to have cashed in on the function. For instance, "Miss O'Dare's creation stamps Madame Lucy "as probably the greatest dressmaker in the world." No good's going to come of this. Uh-uh. But don't say I didn't warn you. No, Granny. Has it ever occurred to you that the neighbours are going to be asking questions? Yes, Granny. And what do you suppose I'm going to tell them? Granny, how do you spell Bermuda? B-U-R-M... What's that got to do with what I got to tell the neighbours? You sure it isn't B-E-R? Sure you're as obstinate and pigheaded as your dead father, rest his soul. He'd argue all day - that Philadelphia was nearer to New York than New York was to Philadelphia. Oh, go on, would you. Don't you think you've had enough exercise this morning, Don? I'm a bit sluggish, mother. I think we better find another spot next year. Whatever for? Well, it seems to have bored you pretty successfully this year. Sorry, dear. Think I need a drink. Johnson, give me scotch and soda. Very well, sir. The mail, madam. Johnson? When does the clipper leave? For New York, sir? Yes, for New York. In about 40 minutes. Come get the launch ready. What's happened, Don? I don't know, but I'm going to find out. She doesn't live here anymore. Yes, yes. I know. You told me. But what is she doing? Well, we don't talk about it. It's a secret. But I'm a very close friend. Yes, I know. You were really the cause of it all, weren't you? Me? We've told everybody here she's gone to a job in Philadelphia. Look, here. I'm afraid I'm a little bit in the dark about all this. Will you please tell me where I can find her? It's most urgent. Well, if you swear you won't... I swear! You'll find her at 400 Park Avenue. 400 Park... 400 Park Avenue! Good heavens! Now, don't you tell her I told you! Miss O'Dare? No. She isn't in, sir. I'm sorry. Miss O'Dare isn't in, sir. They told me I'd find her here. She does live here? Yes. Well, where is she? Now? Yes. Well, I'm not supposed to give out information, sir, but she's at the opening of Rex Gordon's revue. Oh. Thank you. Can I have your autograph, Miss O'Dare? Of course you can. Ha ha! Press. Why, Don Marshall! Can I have a minute with you alone? Well, I can't... Yes, you can. Just keep writing on that card. What's this all about? It's all the doings of Smithy. Smithy? Mm-hmm. Mr Smith. Mr Smith? You mean that little stick in the mud? You mean he's responsible for this whole transformation? Oh, yes. He's been just wonderful to me. He says it's a great success. My dear, the curtain's going up. Look here. How about some supper after the show? Then you can tell me all about it. Oh, I'm afraid I can't... Well, lunch tomorrow? Oh, I can't, I'm... Dinner? I'm dining with Mrs Vincent. Look, will you call me? I'm living at... I know. 400 Park Avenue. Oh, that's right. Yes. AUDIENCE TALKS Anybody thinks she's a film star. Ah. The princess keeps her very much to herself. She certainly does credit to Madame Lucy. Madame Lucy? She makes every stitch that she wears. INTRODUCTION MUSIC PLAYS NARRATOR: 'If we believe all we read in the newspapers, 'everything and everyone has been chased off the front page 'by the Irish heiress who's leading New York society this season.

SMITH LAUGHS Well, I don't like it and it's got to be put a stop to at once! We're coining money, Mr Marshall. What's wrong with it? I'll tell you what's wrong with it. You absolutely destroyed an innocent young girl's life for the sake of your vulgar publicity. Oh, hooey, Mr Marshall. If I may be forgiven the word - hooey. We're giving her the time of her life - clothes, dances, parties, admiration. Why, everything a girl wants. Well, I don't like it! It's got to stop right now. Too late to stop it now, Mr Marshall. The public's got it. It's out of our hands. Why, they're even attacking her in Gordon's review. I promoted that. That's not an attack. That's a boost. It was all my idea. Oh, it was, was it? Smith, I'd like to wring your neck! You given any thought to what's going to happen to this girl when this is over? She'll probably get married. Married. What man in his right sense is going to marry a girl who's been financed by a dressmaker - touted in every shop and nightclub in town? Half the men in New York are crazy about her, including your friend Mr Vincent. You mean Bob? # Irene # Little bit of soft and sweetness # Irene # A dainty slip of rare completeness # Mannerism, magnetism # Eyes of youth inviting # Dancing while we're glancing by the # Flush of her exciting # Irene # The sort who captures hearts to charm them # Careful. # That tune again! Going any place with Miss O'Dare certainly makes one conspicuous. I hate being conspicuous. C'est difficile, n'est-ce pas, princess? I rather like it. Oh. # Captured in the net # How typical with Irene O'Dare... # Are you still on your diet, darling? Yes, I'm afraid so. Mere coffee and nuts? I wonder if she's all they say. She is a phoney. You mean, she isn't Irish? She's Irish, all right - shanty Irish. Tell me, my dear, have you heard from your Aunt Bridget lately? Dear Lady O'Dare. No, not lately. Did you write to tell her that we have met? Well, I'm afraid I haven't yet, princess. Do you know what I suspect? Suspect. That you're a very bad correspondent. SHE LAUGHS How delightfully unexpected, princess, you are. It's in the blood, I suppose. Bob, Look, there's Don Marshall. So it is. I didn't know he'd come back. Excuse me, darling. I want to have a word with Don. MRS VINCENT: Bring him over to the table, dear. Oh, hello, Bob. Sit down. Have a drink? Yes. I'll have a sherry. Sherry, please. Yes. Bermuda fun? Oh, hilarious. Look here, Don. I'm fed up with this. What? Night life of New York? No. Your exploitation of this girl. It's pretty rotten. What do you mean? Showing a pretty girl a good time? How's it all going to end? What can it lead to? Well, among other things, I understand it may lead to matrimony. She's got this young Vincent going now. You don't think he'd marry her, do you? Not likely. But I happen to know it's his money she's throwing around like a drunken sailor. You don't understand her, Don. No? She's a very rare person. You don't tell me! You're so cold-blooded about the whole thing, you're probably ruining the life of one of the sweetest... Bob, you're making her sound so attractive, I must ask her to dance myself. Of course it didn't occur to you that I may know nothing at all about this stunt. What? Good evening, Mrs Vincent. Hello, Don. You know everyone, don't you, except the princess. I modelled with her for weeks. There isn't much you don't know about a girl you model with. You mean, she's a professional model? Hardly that. She tried to muscle in on our racket. Smithy soon spotted her. May I steal her for one dance? Well, you may. Thank you very much. Hey, look at that - Don Marshall. What about that for fast work? That's funny. She had those two on the run at the ball I told you about. Irene, I want to say something rather serious. You don't like all this, do you? Not like it? Why, I love it! My one fear is that I shall wake up some day and find it isn't true. You want nothing to spoil it? I should say not. Would you, if you suddenly found yourself having all the things you always dreamed about and going to all the places that you'd only been to in your imagination? No, I suppose not. I knew you would understand. Oh, it's such a relief to be with you. I can be myself and I can talk like myself. After all, I did know you when the skeleton in your cupboard was only a family ghost, didn't I? SHE LAUGHS Say, you're not going to write about it in your column are you? I never write anything as interesting as that. What are you going to do? Let me see. I wonder if the O'Dare is all the society. Will you sit down, Mrs O'dare? And I'll tell her you're here. All right. Tell her to get here and get here quick. Granny! Oh, take that smile off your face. When I finish with you, you'll never want to smile again. I knew no good could come of it. I knew it would only lead to disgrace. You wanted your fun and your fine feathers, didn't you? Well, you got your fine feathers, all right, but you got the bird with them. Oh, Granny, will you stop being dramatic... oh, for the saints above that I should ever live to have a grandchild of mine so disgrace herself that she'd be put in the papers for the whole world to read. Look at that! And who is this scion of a fine family whose mother has a mansion in Roslyn? Why, 'tis - 'tis Bob Vincent. What does he mean, this Biffy Webster? It's plain to see what he means. He means that you're nothing but a lost soul. That's what he means. You go to Madame Lucy, and you tell Madame Lucy to come right out in the open and tell the whole world that it's she who's paying your expenses and not any scion of no family. Do you understand? You're right, Granny. Of course I'm right. And if you'd listen to me instead of your fine friends, you wouldn't be branded now and your name all smirched up. You are Madame Lucy. Yes, I... I am. That will be all, Mr Smith. Yes, I'm afraid so. Then 'tis really you who have been paying the hotel bills? Yes. And for me dresses and me car? Yes. But you mustn't feel under any obligation. Thank you. I'll try not to. What did you think that night at the theatre when I was confiding me great secret to you? I felt rather pleased that you wanted me to know the truth. The truth. You weren't handing out much of it yourself, were you? But the whole point... but the whole point is this... that when I thought you were being so kind to me, you were really exploiting me for the sake of your own business. Ah, how you must have laughed at me up your sleeve. But, Irene, I've never laughed at you. Have you not? Then 'tis only because you have no sense of humour because I could almost die with laughing at meself. Come, come. It isn't as bad as all that. No-one has ever said anything against you. Oh, have they not? Maybe you don't read the newspapers. I suppose that's another part of your grand publicity scheme. All right, I'll knock that fellow's block off. That would help. That would get me mussed up in a street brawl. It'll restore me good name entirely. Irene, believe me... Will you please take your hands off me? But please listen to me. If you'd like to listen to what I have in my mind, maybe you wouldn't care to listen at all. Ah, why should I waste my breath on you? Madame Lucy(!) Send in Mr Smith immediately. She loves me. Ah, Smith. Smith, I'm expecting to be married. Married, sir? Yes, married. Really. Well, congratulations. May I? Yes. By all means. I'd like to find out how long it'll take to make the wedding dress. How many bridesmaids will there be? Oh, no bridesmaids. No bridesmaids. Nope. About a week from the first fitting. Fitting? No fitting, Smith. No fitting. No fitting. Mr Marshall, it'll be quite impossible to make the dress without knowing the bride's measurements. Really? Yes. Requires a little thought, doesn't it? Yes. Let's see. Miss O'Dare. Yes? I think she's just the size. You have her measurements? Oh, yes, sir. The manager, please. This is Miss O'Dare. I'm leaving here today, and I want you to send up my bill. I do not want it sent to Mr Smith. I'll pay it myself, thank you. Oh, you are, are you? You can save your soul of discretion for where it's needed. I said, I want to pay me own bill. Thank you. What's that? Oh, how much? How much?! Well, perhaps you had better follow up Mr Smith's instructions. Oh. Oh, Bob, the most terrible thing has happened. Have you seen the papers? Mm-hmm. That's why I came. What does it matter? No-one will believe it. Oh, why would they not? Well, anyhow, it isn't your fault. And, you know, I never did like seeing you exploited like a... SHE SOBS Now, darling, it'll all work out. Oh, Bob! No. No orchids. No. Nor gardenias. I don't think she'd like them. But send some violets. Yes, those big ones. Now, what do you call those little roses that have a sort of green fuzz all over them? Huh? Yes, moss roses. That's right. Send a lot of those. I want the boy to call on my office on his way downtown because I want him to put in a note. Yes... Hello, Don. Busy? No. Sit down. I'll be right with you. You've got the address? Yes, that's right. You won't forget the note, now, will you? All right. Thanks very much. Well? Well, now, what's that phrase, "I want you to be the first to know"? Well. Well, what happened? Granny, I'm going to be married. What?! Mm-hmm. To Bob Vincent. The man that Biffy Webster was... Oh! Oh! Oh! Helen, Jane, come on down quick! Granny! Irene is going to be married! Do you want the whole world to know? Sure, I do. Do you think I like the way we've been living this lie, telling all me friends that you was working in Philadelphia and them liable to bump up against you any day on Fifth Avenue? Love has found a way out of the whole mess. Sit down there and tell me all about it, now. Well, Granny... Yes. It's going to be a very quiet wedding... That's good. Down at Roslyn Manor. Yes. Of course, I want you to be the best man. Well, thanks very much, Bob. She's a very nice young girl. Ah, if you don't know, well, you have no idea how grand she is. Yeah, she's got a lot of spirit... and a quick temper she can call you out, I can tell you. Can she really? Well, you're very lucky. You bet I'm lucky. The boy from the florist is asking for a note. There's no note, Smith. Just tell him to take the box as is. Yes, sir. Smith, I'm going to get married. Married? Congratulations. May I? Of course. There seems to be quite an epidemic. Mr Marshall was just saying... Ahem. Mr Marshall was just saying, Bob, that we have the prettiest wedding dress you ever saw actually in work, and all you have to do is to send the bride around, and I think you'll find that it's her size exactly. And Mrs Vincent wants you to come and stay for the wedding. Oh, no. Oh, no. Not me. What would an old-fashioned woman like me be doing with those fine folks? They got no use for me, and I've got no use for them. Granny, darling... I want you there. Oh, well, that's different. You did say wedding, didn't you? SHE SOBS I thought perhaps from the looks of you and the sound of you, you might mean a wake. Oh, Eleanor, how can I go through with this rehearsal? Oh, my dear, why didn't you fall in love with Bob and save us all this humiliation? It's rather late to think about that now, darling. I suppose so. But I was superb at dinner, wasn't I? I kept the conversation going, didn't I? You certainly did. No-one would have ever guessed that my heart was breaking. Russell, you know where to put it. Yes, sir. Russell, in the darker cellar. Yes, sir. If I like someone, it doesn't matter to me whether they landed at Plymouth Rock or Ellis Island. How noble of you, Eleanor. How like a worth. Come on, darling. We shall be late. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Excuse me, sir, but the ladies are coming downstairs. Well, what of it? Your hair, sir, if I may say so, isn't just the thing. Oh. What's that? A stiff brandy, sir. I've been through a great many weddings, and I've always found there comes a time when the bridegroom needs a stiff brandy. Betherton, you know everything. Yes, sir. I'm glad you noticed it, sir. Looking pretty snappy tonight, Eleanor. Thank you. If you lose any more weight, it'll be too much. I'm not trying to lose weight. No? I noticed you didn't eat a mouthful at dinner. You're getting observant in your old age, aren't you? Thank you, darling. Come along, dear. Oh! The wedding dress, madam. Do you want it here? MRS VINCENT: No. Of course not. I want it at the church, not here. Mr Smith, madam. Oh, Mr Smith, Smith with an I. You see, I have a very good memory. I never forget a face. Betherton! Betherton - oh, there you are. Didn't they send anyone with the dress? How incredibly careless a modern shop is. In my day, they'd have sent their head men for the most socially important wedding of the season. Why didn't they send - Eleanor, what was the name of that nice little man at Madame Lucy's? Smith, madam, with an I. SHE CHUCKLES Oh, of course. Of course. I knew you immediately. How nice of you to come yourself. Come along, Eleanor. Bob, do you mind very much if I don't go to the church? As a matter of fact, I don't see much sense in it myself. But mother's pretty keen on it, and I find it usually saves time to do what she wants. I know. And I'd hate to disappoint her. But 'tis terribly bad luck for me to go. What about me? Sure. You're not Irish. Anyway it 'tis only the bride it's unlucky for. All right, darling. See you after the show. Eleanor, darling, you be the bride. Dear Irene is superstitious about rehearsals. The Irish are so quaint. Bob, darling, you take the bride to the altar. Come, Mr Smith. A little activity, please. We want to measure the train to see where it comes to on the altar steps. Will you put those down there, please? If I might suggest, the veil is the same length as the bridal train, so that if we were to measure the veil, it would... it sounds terrible. But I think I would like to see what you mean. Yes. Right. Take one step forward, please, darlings. Just a little one. Good evening, Betherton. Is Mr Robert in? Sir, they're all over at the church for a rehearsal of the wedding. I rather fancied they expected you there, sir. Not me, Betherton. I don't like weddings. Get me a whiskey and soda, will you? Yes, sir. Oh, Bob, why did you do it? I don't know. I can't think - it just happened. MRS VINCENT: Oh, that's a lovely length, isn't it, Mr Smith? Exquisite, yes. Eleanor, my darling, I'll get out of it. But you can't get out of it. But I must. Do you think I'd marry anyone when I know we love each other? SHE HUMS TO HERSELF Thank you. # I don't love you sweetheart # I'm beyond that # For I adore you # You've got me out on a limb # Please break the fall # For me. # Oh, darling, I'm so glad you didn't go to the church. SHE SOBS Oh, I am miserable. I want to talk to you. No, no. Don't say anything till I've finished. I don't love you, Bob. I want you to know while there's still time. I'm in love with Don. Say that again, will you? Granny. Not a word out of you till I finish this chapter. Sure is the greatest book I ever read. Will you put that down and listen to me? Now what? Well, that went off very well, didn't it? Betherton, is supper ready? Yes, ma'am. I told Betherton to have some champagne and sandwiches for us. I don't want any, thank you. Eleanor, Eleanor! What is the matter with Eleanor? She's coming down with influenza. That's what it is. Suppose she's ill for the wedding. Oh, what a calamity. Well, Mr Smith, quite an evening. Yes... Oh, Betherton, as one Englishman to another, I could do with a spot if you know what I mean. Indeed I do, sir. Hello, Don. Bob. How did the rehearsal go? Well, mother enjoyed it. That seemed to be the main point. Uh-huh. Why weren't you there? Me? Oh, I couldn't make it. Irene didn't go either. She's superstitious. You haven't seen her about, have you? Yes. She was here a while ago. I think she's gone to bed. Is she all right? What do you mean, "all right"? Well, did she seem happy? Aren't brides always happy the night before they're married? Where was he with his great love when you were free? Seems to me he's one of those fellas who only wants a girl when he knows he can't get her. Oh, but Don isn't like that. Well, whatever he's like, no O'Dare was ever a jilt, except she who walks by the river at twilight. You want to spend the whole of your future life in the other world haunting the rest of us? How idiotic. You've known each other since you were children, and you don't find out that you love each other till the night before his wedding. And poor Irene, who adores him so. Are you sure of that? Of course. She worships the very ground he walks on. You know how women are about Bob. And even if she didn't... I know. It's too late. Too late? Why, of course it is. The cake is ready. The fiddlers are ordered. The gilt chairs are in the house. The guests will be arriving in 12 hours. SMITH SIGHS At last, a peaceful spot. Yes, sir. Far from the maddening crowd. Oh, that's just what the doctor ordered. In some houses, you know, sir, this is looked upon as a luxury. In this house, it's a necessity. But don't you see? I just can't go through with it. 'Twould be living a lie. You're not going to break your given word. Poor Bob, who worships the very ground you walk on. Don... I'm in a spot. Yes, a very lucky spot, if you ask me. SARCASTICALLY: Very lucky. The night before my wedding, I find I'm in love with someone else. Eleanor? Mm-hmm. Are you mad? No. Just crazy. IRENE: B-But what's the matter? Bob doesn't want to marry you. What? He loathes you. He's in love with Eleanor. How do you know? Because he told me. Oh, Don! Don, darling. Robert, what are you doing? Don't get excited, Mother. It's all right. It can't be. There must be something wrong. There's nothing wrong. Don and Irene have been crazy about each other all along. Darling? What? Does he know about her past and about Madame Lucy? Does he know about Madame Lucy? He is Madame Lucy. Don Marshall is Madame Lucy? Yes. Oh, Betherton! Will you stop this indecent hugging and kissing and tell me who that man is? I know who you are. You're Granny. Right. Irene... not bad.
