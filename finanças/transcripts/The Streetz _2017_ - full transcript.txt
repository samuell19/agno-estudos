(booming) - [Detective Brown Voiceover] A cop. Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be a cop. My grandfather was a cop. My dad was a cop. And as a man of color, justice is the right thing to do. - [Everyone] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. - [Detective Brown Voiceover] I take my job seriously, morning, noon, and night, but I just don't know what today's gonna bring. But being a cop, it's never a break. Look at this kid, Danny Rivera, like Freddy, chasing the American dream, aspiring rapper. Unfortunately, he's dating an addict. Will she get help? I don't know. Now her father, Congressman Russo, that's a different story. Something's up with him. I don't trust him. But time to go to work. Time to do what my wife divorced me for, a job. A job that my grandad and my dad would be proud of today. It's time to go get them, because it's not about the paycheck. It's about the love for the job. - Whatever he says is not true. Music doesn't pay the bills. This does. - Those two guys, they're full of shit. I'm in charge here. It's my world. They just live in it. - These guys are delusional. Believe what you want to believe.

So Tony, where are we going with this? You know that rat bastard Sammi? - Of course. - He's back out in the fucking streets. - Bigmouth Sammi. All he had to do was suck it up, serve his time, and shut his big fucking mouth. - Yeah. And five years later, now who are we stuck with? The fucking Chinese. - I trust everybody at this table's got good intensions. And remember one thing. Blood's thicker than water. - Do me a favor, tell Tommy to get Tracy a job at the casino. I promised her a job over there. - You got it, Tony. - Thank you. - How about this? I meet you guys later at the club.

Wow, I like your outfit! - Hey, did you happen to see that girl go up the stairs? - [Frankie] Yeah, why? - That puttana was on the phone with Wong. - Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it. - Okay, thanks. - Hey. - Oh, what are you doing? - What's going on? - Hey sweetie, you got everything ready for your trip?

This is a nice place. The view's killer. The food is great. - [Frankie] Hey Tony. I talked to Tommy about that thing. He's taking care of it. - Good, thank you. - See that blonde over there? Bella said she caught her talking to Wong. What do you want to do? - I'll take care of it. - I can't wait to be on my own.

You better look out for Johnny. Word on the street has it that he may be working with the Chinese. - As you all know, we've been facing a crisis with the Elite teams. - There has been many killings and carjackings. We've been surveilling Freddy's shop. - Elite moves fast. They can track a car in 30 seconds, then get it over to Freddy's place. - Yeah, that Freddy, he's a scumbag. - Freddy has also been known to sell cars to the international crime organizations. Louie and ENJ, they always walk, thanks to Detective Rivera, and I bet he's late again too. - I'm about to take down two suspects today who we believe are part of the Elite Carjacking Team. - Let me guess, Pearl White, and her accomplice is Savannah? - Yes. - I believe this is a lot deeper than we know. - I would like to welcome a new member to our team. - If you don't mind, can you please give us a little background in who you are? - Yes. Good morning. I'm Detective Bonacasa. I am a Special Task Force member for 20 years. I was assigned to this department, and I transferred from Miami. That's about it. - Yeah, welcome. - Welcome. - Welcome. - Welcome. - Detective Magnus and Perez are no longer with us. They were transferred to Chicago. - Can we transfer Detective Rivera too? (people laughing) - We're home! Hee hee! Come on, pretty boy! Come on, handsome. - Got the wrong blood cop right there. - Oh yeah, you're motherfucking innocent now. - Loosen up the cuff now. - I'll loosen up your fucking face. Shut the fuck up.

They're not mine! - I'm being set up. I swear to God. I never seen them. - You call yourself a detective and that's the best you can do? - Let me tell you something. I am done with men. Sanchez, would you like to go for a drink later? - I'll go, but don't get any ideas. - [Carjacker] I'm straight, let's go for it.

We have two that work here. - The owner of this establishment, can you tell us where we could find him? - He took the day off today. Can I help you? - Looks like you've got some expensive cars here. - Fuck. - I'm new here. You'd have to ask Freddy. - Can you let him know that Lorenzo and Brown paid him a visit? - Sure. - Okay, have a nice day. - Have a good day. - [Secretary] Thank you, you too. - [Detective Brown] I think I heard that asshole behind the door. - [Detective Lorenzo] I think that asshole was there. (machinery whirring) - Fuck. The detectives, what did they want? - What do you think? They wanted to know why there are so many expensive cars here. - They're snooping around. I don't like it. - They're snooping around. - I don't know what's going on, I don't want to know. - Nothing's going on. I run a legit business. - I know it's your business. I just work for you. - Calm down, relax. Everything is fine. Get to work. - Before I forget, they said they're coming back and they're turning this place upside-down. - Shut up! I need time to think!

Bye. - See you later. - Pretty sure I'm gonna see you again. - Maybe you will. Bye, Red. - Morning. - Have a nice day. - You too. - So, Detective Rivera, are you and Brown ever bringing in Louie? - (laughs) You ever gonna become a real detective? - (laughs) It's almost the end of the month. How many callers you have, one? - I see you've got jokes for days. Why don't you have another doughnut? Looking like you're getting a little wide in the can. - (laughs) You know they're taking applications for cadets. Know what? I bet at the end of the month Detective Davina has more callers than you. - I bet you 50, matter of fact, make it 100, that by the end of the month I bring in Louie and I have more callers than Davina. - Okay. I'll take you up on that bet. But at the end of the month, if Detective Davina has more callers then you, you owe me double. (Detective Rivera laughs) By the way, you're wasting my time. I have real police business to do. - [Mayor] Good morning, Detective Sanchez. - Good morning, Mayor. Would you like a cup of coffee? - I would, I would. That would help me wake up. - Good, I'm glad. - Detective Sanchez, when are we gonna go out? - First of all, you're married. Second of all, you couldn't handle a girl like me. And third of all, my boyfriend wouldn't be too happy about it. - Sanchez, you're killing me. - Is it the eyes? - I'm not ready to give up on those eyes just yet. - Good morning, Mayor. Are we still on for our lunch date? - You're having lunch with Gordon and dinner with me? - I'm just here to see Captain Jackson. Is she around? - Her office is that way, but you already knew that. - Yeah, don't bother. She just left with Detective Franco. Good luck. - I'm gonna go there. - We have to make sure that the Chinese do not find the girl. - True. She's well-hidden, where no one is going to find her. Don't worry. Congressman's brothers and wife are coming in this afternoon. I am going to intercept them with a gun. - Make sure that they do not live to tell their story. - They won't. They hold a black clouds over the Congressman's head. - Take this disc to your home, and do not bring it back. This disc is gonna tell you everything that's going on. (Jill screams) - Feels good to have a clean shave. - Forget about the shave. Let's get this car. Watch her. She's getting out the car. Let's get this car!

(gunshot fires) - Oh why'd you have to shoot her for?! (tires squealing) - [Woman] They shot my husband! - Stop or I'll shoot! (gunshot fires) (woman cries out) - You were told not to trust a stranger. (dramatic music) (sirens whirring) (tires squealing) - What direction were you coming when you saw this body? - I was jogging in this direction, and I saw the body on my left, and my dog stopped really quickly. - Did you see anybody in the area where you were jogging? - I, I don't remember. Oh, she, she did have a bruise on her face, or at least that's what it looked like. Um, and she did kind of seem nervous, now that I'm thinking about it. Yeah, buddy, I know. - That's it? You don't, you don't recall anything else? - Hmm. The guy, he had, he had a baseball cap on, and sunglasses, and, uh, the, the girl was wearing a dress, but that, that's all I remember. - Do you remember how tall they might've been? - No, it was really fast. I'm sorry. - So you ready to go to work? - Work, that's all I ever do. - That's true. Trying to catch the bad guys. - You know Detective Rivera? - Yeah. - He's a nice guy, isn't he? - Are you kidding me? So he has you fooled too, huh? - No, but he buys me coffee every morning. I really don't mind if he kisses my ass. - He's a guy. They all have ulterior motives. I can see what he sees in you. - Thank you. But you know we're just friends. I am not sleeping with him. - On to the next one. Do you know he always has an excuse for coming in to work late? Last time he said he drove his car through the carwash and left his windows down and he got flooded! I thought, "Put your windows up, asshole!" - (laughs) Wow. But you know, he does have nice eyes, doesn't he? - Really? Remind me to get you a pair of glasses. - Get off of me, bro! I didn't do anything! - What the fuck?! - Sit down, shut the fuck up! We know you're part of the Elite Team. - I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - I don't know what the fuck you are talking about. - You gotta talk to the judge. - I just came from Morris Park. You remember Amie, the one that's married to Detective-- - Raul. - Raul. - Mm-hmm. - She was found dead at the park. - Oh my. - Strangled, beaten. - You think Raul did it? - Maybe. See, I lost all respect of Raul when I found out he was beating his wife. Oh, and then when I get promoted to being the lieutenant, he wanted a transfer, so they gave it to him. - So what do I owe the pleasure of this visit? (sentimental music) - I needed to talk to a close friend. - Tony's not here. - I came to talk to you. - What's on your mind? - I have a lot on my mind.

Damn, she is gone. - Gotta replace her with somebody though. - I know, do you trust anybody? - My cousin Melissa, she's perfect. - I don't, I don't know, man. I don't know. I don't know. - Ah. Are you ready for that? - I'm always ready. It's nothing new to me. Come on, just give me one chance. Been racing cars for years. It's nothing new to me. - Yeah, but it's a lot more than racing, man. You gotta be able to dip on the cops. If we call, you gotta be there within minutes. You know what I'm saying? There's a lot more to this, man. You get shot at, whatever the case is, you think you can handle that? - Listen, she's my cousin. Anything happens, I take total responsibility. I will go down for her. - You know what? She never steered us wrong, never did anything wrong to us. We'll give it, we'll... It's a go. We'll give it a shot. - Make sure they don't find the girl, and at the end, I don't want none of yous around. - Thank you. We'll let Tony know. - Mm-hmm. - Listen, we're gonna pay Kawasaki a visit. He doesn't fucking know anything. - That's what I want to hear. Good work, gentlemen. - Thanks! Asshole. - I want to fucking kill that cop. - I wish. - Man, trust Pink. She never did us wrong. - I understand that, but she gotta be able to get in and out of the cars and away from the cops at the same time. - Man, that's on Pink. That's out of my hands. We didn't even tell her that Ruby's out of jail yet! - That's a whole nother situation. I'm not even trying to get into that right now. - Come on, we gotta go. - [Carjacker With Sunglasses] Yeah, let's go. ♪ I try to I try to I try to I try to ♪ - Yo guys, wait up!

I'm letting you know now, you better tell her that she's not coming back. I've been running things since she has been in there, and she is not coming back. And you better tell her that, because I'm the boss. - I'm the boss! - No, I'm the boss! - I'm the boss! - And I'm letting you know! - Yo, let it go, man. - No, you gotta tell her that! - Here's your cream, enjoy. ♪ For he's a jolly good fella ♪ For he's a jolly good fella - [Freddy] It's party time! - Hey! - Baizano! - How's my girls doing? - Baizano!

I forgot my name. Lorenzo, tell him who I am. (laughs) - He's the main boss for the Carjacking Team. - That's right. You guys are working for me, baizano. (knocking on the door) - Jill? (knocking on the door) Jill? Jill, mami? Jill, oh my god, you... Jill! Oh my god. Mr. and Miss Russo! Miss Russo! Miss Russo! Mr. and Miss Russo, please get up! Please get up, there's something wrong with Jill! Please! - Jill, Jill, Jill, Jill! Oh my god! Jill, Jill! My baby. - [Mr. Russo] I'm gonna call 911! - Miss Russo, I found her unconscious, with a bottle of pills! - Where did she get those from?! - [Housekeeper] I have no idea, Miss Russo. - Was there a drink in this goddamn house? - No, not that I know of, I swear! (Mrs. Russo sobs) - You better tell me the truth, I swear to god, or you're out of here, puta! - [Mr. Russo] What are we talking about here? - Your daughter's hanging around in that recording studio with ENJ! Look what's happened to her! Are you serious?! You get somebody up here now! Jill! Jesus Christ. Jill, come on, baby. - Hey Tone, look what I got here. The business owner you want. (slapping) - [Tony] Vincent, Vincent. You stupid fuck! - Tony, I'll get your money, I swear to god! - Take that piece of shit in the back and fucking put a bullet in his fucking head! - Tony, you can't kill him in the presence of a detective. - It's your fucking money too! - Like I said, kill him. (gunshot fires) (gasping) - Hey Tony, thanks for having Sonny whack that motherfucker. Now I gotta go clean this fucking mess up. (people chattering) - Oh god. - I'm sorry. - What are you doing? - Are you okay? - Yeah I'm fine. What are you doing here? - I've got meetings all day. - Oh, I see. - Busy. - You're here to take Gordon out to lunch again. - Gordon. Uh, Gordon is not too happy with me. - I don't blame her. - Why you say that? - Hello. - Hi. - Are you ready? - Absolutely. I had a very long and hard day. (people chattering) - Hear what happened to your girl Davina? - What happened? - She got transferred to Argentina. Looks like I win the bet. Girl, Brooks isn't gonna be too happy. - Oh, no, I wouldn't get too excited. You might get transferred next. You're always late. - Don't you wish. Looks like you've been eating a lot of the doughnuts, getting wide in the can like Brooks. Anyway, you coming up, or am I holding this elevator for nothing? - No, I'll take the stairs. I need the exercise. - (laughs) Yeah, you do. You said it. See you up there. (elevator dings) (creepy music) - [Bravo] Alpha, this is Bravo. We have positive confirmation on what appears to be code names Red and J.R. Do you copy? Over. - [Alpha] Copy, Bravo. Maintain your position. - It's party time! Yeah, where the party's at! - Fuck, let's go - Please can I shoot him already? - [Alpha] That's a negative. Stand down. - [Male Detective] Be quiet. - [Bravo] Okay, he's... (cork pops) - Oh yes, baby! Yes, you're all mine! (eerie music) Kitty kitty kitty. Hey kitty! (creepy music) Oh. What is that? Oh, look what we got here. I found you, you little devil. You stupid cork. You bad kitty. - [Alpha] Do not abort the mission. - [Bravo] Yes, sir. - [Alpha] Do you hear me? Do not abort the mission. - [Bravo] Yes, sir. - [Computer] Initiating satellite scan. - It looks like we have some company. Get out of there now. Over. (beeping) (foreboding music) - Fucking boat is this? What the fuck? Oh, shit! - This is my fucking boat. - Motherfucker! - [Man With Hat] Let me see your hands, let me see your hands. - Who the fuck are you? - [Man With Hat] Put them down. - Fucking pigs. - You got a gun? - [Man With Hat] What are you gonna do with this, huh? - Yeah. - Huh? - I'm gonna blast your fucking ass. - Piece of shit, get out of here. I'll blow your fucking head off. Say another word. If you get up, I'm gonna shoot you. You hear me? When you don't see me, I'm gone. - Fuck you. (beeping) Fuck. (tense music) Fuck this motherfucker. Fuck you! (suspenseful music) - Here's the envelope Lorenzo, that crooked cop, gave me. - Ah, very nice. - I want to fucking kill that cop. - In time, in time. Hey Dave, how are you, Dave? - Good, how you doing? - You got my fucking money? - Your money, what? What are you talking about? - I'm only fucking with you, relax. Matter of fact, do me a favor. Get back to the, get back to the girls, take care of them. - All right. - Okay. - Thanks. - You got it. - Ah, well. - Has he been hitting you? - Hitting me? Do you really think that's gonna change? All I can say is thank you for being there for me. I love you. - That's what sisters are for. - I know I'm gonna have to talk to Tony eventually. - He's here tonight. Maybe you gotta pull him on the side. - I want one day! I want a fucking day! And we're not delivering the girl to the fucking Chinese! - You know what, Tony? I'm gonna put a bullet in the back of his fucking head, and splatter his brains from here to Brooklyn. These guys are gonna learn once and for all not to fuck with us. I want him first. - I want to introduce him to a special girl friend of mine. Her name's Lucille. (laughs) And I heard she cuts pretty damn sharp. - You get Kawasaki. I'll get that motherfucker Wong. - Yeah, we'll dump that piece of shit in the dumpster. - You want a hit? - This way the rats will eat him. Fucking rat that he is. - Nobody fucks with me! Nobody fucks with the family! - They're all a bunch of fucking midgets. They're about to meet their fate. (maleficent music) (energetic dance music) - Ink watched the whole thing from her window when they hit the bumper. Yo, you ready for the Elite? - Nine ball, side pocket. - It's not every day I get to roll an old team. - Elite's about loyalty, about keeping it real with each other. - This is where I belong. - [Carjacker] You can't bring this back to Freddy's. It's way too hot. Man, go open the gate there. - All right. (car dinging) (eerie music) Oh shit, we got company! (gunshots firing) - Wait, did you hear that? - We have company. You go outside. You follow me. Let's go! (gunshots firing) (glass breaking) (irritated hip-hop music) (gunshots firing) (tires squealing) (gunshots firing) (glass breaking) - You guys came here late! - Motherfuckers gotta away! You believe that shit? - Shit! Yeah man, trying to freaking kill us and you guys come running out there late. - We need to talk about Pink. What are we gonna do with her? - I can't discuss it. I'm running late as it is, and I still have to hit the office. - It's your daughter, not mine. We need to talk about this! - I get it, but I have an important event with the president, so we're just gonna have to table this until later tonight, like when I get home, okay? - It's your daughter! - I said the president! I'm not gonna be the guy who walks in late, interrupts the president, and gets on the nightly news like, "Sorry, my bad, dude, it's just me, Congressman Jerk off!" - You're a jerk! You don't even know she's gonna be home later! - Look, Pink is the self-sufficient one. She can take care of herself. She's not like Jill. So maybe you're just blowing things out of proportion a little bit. - I tried to talk to her. She's rude and disrespectful, telling me I'm not her mom! Do you know how that makes me feel?! - I'm trying to be a good dad to both these girls. Growing up, it was just my brother and I. We struggled, so give me an A for effort, okay? I'm just trying to get out of here. Give me a kiss so I can leave. - No, go! Go have fun at your event! See if I care! I'm so sick of this! Did you forget I have a great career too?! - I didn't forget! I love you too! (serious music) - (laughs) See you changed your clothes. - What's the matter, dad made you cry again? - Why do you always have to treat me that way? - (laughs) You just don't get it. I don't like you. - What's the matter? You jealous because dad pays more attention to me? Is that what's bothering you? - Are you serious?! He doesn't care about no one. All he cares about is politics, his lawyers, and this marriage, you call this a marriage? This ain't no marriage. It's more like a fiasco. - It's because of you and your sister. You put a strain on our marriage. You're so disrespectful, and your sister's out there hanging around with all the wrong people! What do you think is gonna happen?! - You criticize everyone! You talk about everyone! Late hours at the office, my ass. It's more like you're having an affair. (slapping skin) - You bitch! I don't need to take this abuse from you or anyone else. Do you understand? - I should kill you. I hated you before, but now I despise you. - Maybe you should've thought about the next time you won't be treating me this way. - Next time you touch me, I will kill you! (somber music) - Jill! What are you doing here?! I told you I don't want to see you here! (sirens whirring) - I just came to see an old friend. - Yeah, she just came to see her old friend. - You, shut up! What's in your hand? - Nothing's in my hand. - What is in your hand? - Nothing's in my hand! You're such an ass! - My parents want to send me away to an all-girls school in Texas. - To stimulate from your pill addiction? - Pill? You promised me you weren't gonna do this anymore! - You promised you'd stop carjacking, asshole. Stop bullying your girlfriend. - You shut up. You're lucky your aunt's the captain of the police force. - Leave Script out of this. He's just trying to help. - Help you?! By feeding you pills?! - All I ever wanted was my music career and you. I didn't want to be in these streets. - Is the girl ready to be transported? - Yes, everything's a go. We're just waiting on the department to give us a green light so we can pull out. - Because of the sensitivity and the nature of this case, we don't know where they're taking her. - Headquarters already put the coordinates in the GPSs in our vehicles. They're monitoring our every move. - Regardless, you have to have your ears and your eyes open at all times. The Chinese have affiliations all over. - Yes, I know. I'm aware of the severity of the case, which is why I'm on the case. I'm trained in combat. - Look, you're my sister. I don't want nothing to happen to you. When I first learned that you were gonna be part of Task, I was hoping you'd fail training. - Why would you want me to fail?! - It's not like that. It's that I know law enforcement. It has its perks, but sometimes it's grueling. - Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself. And I would love to stay here and finish this conversation with you, but transport commences now. Tell mom I love her. - Safe trip. I have to make my way to Morris Park. I have an individual that's meeting me there in five minutes. - Okay. - Then I have to go tighten up some loose ends with a friend. - A friend? Which friend? - Can't tell you, because if I did, I would have to kill you. - Ha ha. - Be careful. - [Detective Carter] I will. - What's wrong? - Ma, this isn't fair. Jill's parents want to take her away from me. - Why? What's wrong? - Because of a pill addiction, ma. I already told you this. Her parents now are blaming me for this. - You're not doing pills I hope. - Of course not, ma. - I can't take this! - Of course not, ma! - Are you sure? - Ma, dad was a drug addict! He left us to die! - Don't talk about your father! He was a scumbag! - Sorry, ma. - Look, I've never seen you in love like this before. - I see myself in love with her. - I know you love her. - I do. - But it scares me. - It's scaring me too, ma. But Jill's parents don't see it that way! They think because we're from two different walks of life, I'm from the streets, she's from the suburbs, we don't mix! They're doing everything to break us apart, ma! I can't take this anymore! - Look. It's the heart that counts. - That's what you always told me, ma. - [ENJ's Mom] Yes. - I love you, ma. - I love you too. It'll work out. (ENJ cries) (knocking on the door) - [Pink] It's open, come in! - Hey, Pink. This is Detective Carter. She'll be escorting you to your safe haven. - How are you doing? I work for Task in part of the Ops Division. I'll be transporting you. - And I believe you remember MV. - Hey. Remember me? I see you've been pretty busy, Pink. - Wait. (laughs) You're not a carjacker? This is crazy. And you're telling me that you screwed up. - That means I did my job. See, I was there to protect you because you are the Congressman's daughter. That doctor you shoot, he was there to turn in your state evidence. - Against who? This all sounds like a setup. - I can't discuss that! Hurry up! We need to get out of here! - I'm almost packed. Where are you taking me? - We're taking you to a secret location where the Chinese won't find you. - (laughs) Let me get this straight for the record. My dad, the Congressman, I'm getting kidnapped for ransom? - This is a lot more complicated than you think. We are not to discuss anything from the headquarters, period, not their motives or why. - I don't like sometimes we do. But I guess I don't have a choice, do I? - Everyone always has a choice. Either you go or you stay. And chances are, if you stay, you're dead. - I'll be taking that, thank you. - Well I hope you're ready. We have a long trip ahead of us, and we will be using multiple vehicles. - Jill. - What? - We need to talk. - About what? I don't really have time for this, mom. - You better make time, because this is important. - Do I even want to hear what you're gonna say? Am I staying or am I going? - You're staying on one condition. - There's always a condition. - Listen, you're gonna go see a friend of mine in rehab clinic. You need to get help. - Really? This is the best news (laughs) I've heard in a really long time. ENJ's gonna be so happy. (laughs) - Are you kidding me? ENJ? I thought you weren't with him. What's going on? - Our band just got a major record deal. - Our band? That's not even your band! That's his band! - [Jill] It's our band. - Jill, you need to stop focusing on this music and you need to get better. Do you understand you need to get help? - This is what I need for help! I love him! - I don't really care, Jill. Forget about this music. You're gonna focus on getting better and that's it. Do you understand? - I don't have time for this, mom! - Well you'd better make time! You're lucky I didn't send you away, Jill! - Remember, the department was investigated, including the heads, and they were all under fire. - This case is different. We are dealing with a Congressman's daughter. It's grounds for termination if we screw up. - Hold on one second. - [Carter] It's a green light, so we can pull up. - I've just been informed that they're gonna start bringing her out now. Hey, you should run for Congress. - Who knows, maybe I will. Come on. Let's go get ready to go at 0800 hours. (dramatic music) (gunshots firing) - Run! Come on, let's go! (gunshot fires) Move! - Move it, move it! Hurry up! Let's go, let's go, move it! (tense music) (gunshots firing) (glass shattering) Let's go! Hurry! - Back where it all began. What happened to your leg? - Don't worry about it. Be fine tomorrow. - Those screens that you were questioning me about on your computers, that said "Elite accepting connection," there'll be one more screen. It's gonna say "Elite terminating connection." That was Detective Alvarez, our computer specialist, who was buying us time with the Chinese to get Pink out of harm's way. - I didn't know, and I don't care. - You and your team are exonerated from all charges because you cooperated with the government. ♪ I'm looking in the mirror - Certain things have to stay confidential. Tomorrow, stage two, the final stage, will go into effect on the party boat. Ops did a great job planting those homing devices on the boat. Trust me, the Chinese were watching. We threw them off. - What do you want my team to do? - Nothing. You let us handle it. The Congressman is pleased with your work. He wanted me to let you know that Jill is gonna be getting help. - I love Jill. - I know you do. Maybe now you and her can have a life together because you chose your life and not the streets. You could be a musician, an activist, a politician. Who knows, you might even be a director like Eddie Rocky Rivera. Life plays out like a movie. You got your whole life in front of you. I'll see you tomorrow on that party boat. - See you tomorrow. - All right. - Hey wait. Hey, by the way. - What? - Tell Congressman Lee Russo I wanted to just say I knew he would win. - You got it, kid. Be safe. (computer buzzing) - That's the guy with the car. That's the guy. - Are you sure? - [Man] She's not on the go. - As you all know, we're about to embark on a mission against the Elite. - At what time will we be striking the compound? - Striking time is at 1800 hours. We will be accompanied by three of the Ops Division members, Detective Schwartz, Detective McCain, and Detective Bonanno. All that has already played a role by planting their homing device in the boat. - Detective Rivera will be running a little late. He'll like to know who'll be riding with him. - Rivera will be riding with me, McClain, Brown, with Mike. - So Schwartz and I will be under the Escalades, and will we be behind you? - We're gonna go to the left. You guys are gonna flank to the right. Make sure you use your bulletproof vests, because we don't know what can happen and what we're getting ourselves into. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure, go ahead. What's your question? - Should I go straight at Red? He wields his gun around right away. - Yes. Make sure that we surround the perimeter of the boat. - I take it Detective Alvarez and I will be staying behind to monitor the computers. - Exactly. - [Alvarez] Yeah. - Have you been researching the intel? - Yes, we have. - You know, it hasn't been easy. - Police work is never easy. That's why we do what we do. If there's no further questions, this briefing is concluded. Everybody be safe out there. - Thanks, guys. - All right, be safe out there. - Stay out of sight. (phone ringing) (chaotic music) (sirens whirring) - Put your hands up and freeze! Nobody move! (phone ringing) - [Wong] Hello? - She's not on the boat. - What do you mean she's not on the boat? - Look around. She might be on another boat. (speaking in a foreign language) - My father is gonna kill you! - The boss is not gonna be happy. (speaking in a foreign language) - I just said she is not on the boat. - I've just heard it, okay! She's not on the boat. (speaking in a foreign language) - Are you fucking kidding me, huh? How could she disappear, huh? She has to be there! - Somebody might have tipped them off! Now what do we do?! - How could she slip out of our hands? - I don't know. - You go find her. You go fucking find her! (screaming in a foreign language) (everyone screaming over each other) - I'm not shouting, asshole! I hate you guys! - Hands up! - Hands in the air! - [Lorenzo] Hate to destroy your day, Red, but I told you that we were gonna bring you in. T.J, grab him, cuff him. - Nah man, for real. - Yo! Whoa! (everyone yelling over each other) - How the fuck you running with us that long? You're a cop?! - You have the right to remain silent! - Fuck your rights! - Anything you say can and will be used against you. - Put your hands in the air. - Fuck your rights! - Hands in the air! - Don't move! - Fuck you! - Yeah, man. - Yo, y'all ain't got shit on me! I just got released from jail! - Chill, dude. - Hands in the air. - Hey! - [MV] Do you remember me? - [Ruby] Of course I remember you, asshole. - I remember you! I brought you in last time. We have Pink in custody. - On your knees! - [Ruby] Oh that's where she's at? - [MV] Shut up! - Fuck you. - [MV] Shut up! - All you guys are arrested for murders and carjacking. - Okay, I got nothing! I'm clean! I didn't do nothing! I'm innocent! - You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed for you. (people arguing over each other) - [Freddy] I didn't jack no car. - [Detective] Yeah, okay. You tell that to the guy at the station house. - [Freddy] Carjacking, hey boy, you are carjacking? - They ain't got nothing on us. - Shut up! - They got nothing. - A leak from the inside. - Hey Tony, I'm taking care of that. Lorenzo called me. - Good. - Tracy, can you get that bottle of Rue from the back? - Sure. (beeping) (foreboding music) (gunshot fires) (Tracy cries out) - Gun! (gunshot fires) (gasping) (shocking music) - Bitch. - Now go clean it up, boys. - Yeah, whatevs. (evil music) - Detective Lorenzo has played it out to at least every move. - Yes. Lorenzo's pretty amazing, huh? Get on to one targeted multiple ones, they're just done for, you know? - Yeah. - Hey, you want to go out to dinner? - I told you you were too young for me, but what the heck? I'm not having much luck with the older guys, so I'll accept your invitation. - Great. I'll pick you up at 8:00. - Sounds great. - It's over. Your daughter's safe and sound. - She's safe? - But you're not gonna see her anymore. She's in the Witness Protection Program. No more April Russo. - My Pink. I, I didn't, I, I, I didn't get a chance-- - Intelligence reported back that the Chinese mob was gonna abduct her, so it was either now or never. Oh, and Detective Raul, that day that I went to his house, I opened up the door, and he was hanging with his own belt. He finished the job for me. And let's not forget when I went to Freddy's shop. I sent Detective Brown home, then I went to the park to play. - (laughs) Raul, a chump to the end. We set him up good. Nobody figured that you had offed his wife. That investigator-- - Hi, are you Heather? - I got her that job. - I'm Detective Lorenzo. - And then she was gonna use it to blackmail me! How's that for attitude? - She helped us take care of business. That day, when I put the bomb underneath her car, all the evidence pointed to ENJ. (woman screaming) That was enough to make him and his team cooperate. - The only leverage I had was to threaten to take Jill away. You're a clever man, Detective. - And so are you. - And you're a well-paid one. Here's the 50 as agreed, plus you have another 50 coming to you as a bonus. - What's up? - The Chinese. Look. I'm chairman of the Congressional Trade Committee. The Chinese mob believes that our crew is behind bars, so they think that they can pimp me out to their government trade delegation, and what I want is their government's submarine silence technology that our navy is concerned about, but the Chinese mob is about to throw a kink in our plans and screw up our payday. Check. - [Lorenzo] What is it to say that the rook wouldn't take out the queen? - [Mr. Russo] What's stopping you? - Here we go again. (suspicious music) - Fuck with Tony? (choking) Die, motherfucker! (scary electronic music) (gunshot fires) - I know it was painful (gunshot fires) to have somebody else raise your son. He chose his life instead of yours.
