Can you tell us how long Mrs. West will be staying in Italy? Is it true her husband left her half a billion dollars? I don't know precisely. - Will she remarry? - That's enough questions. - Come on, please. - Hold it right there for a moment. - Over here! - Just take off your glasses. - One more, move aside. - Smile, please. - Over here, Signora West. - Brian! - Get down. Kathryn, dear. How are you? - How long are you remaining in Italy? Is it true your husband left you 200 million dollars? Flight 603 for London now boarding at gate three.

This is Teresa, your guardian angel. Depend on her to take care of all your wants and pleasures. She's efficient as an IBM. How do you do, Teresa? Grazie Signore, please call me Terry. I stayed some months in London, so I know some English. Are you thirsty? Make us a cold drink, Teresa. Look, silence and harmony. The village is only a few kilometers, the marina is just 20 minutes if you like boating. - Oh, I'm afraid I won't feel up to the sea. All right. Well, here we are. No one will bother you here. Oh, it's lovely. Really lovely. Brian, you've been perfect. Wait before saying so. Oh, the house is beautiful. Oh, Brian. - Now you can turn out pictures by Kathryn Somset, just the way you did when you were a promising young artist in New York. Too much time has passed since then. I'm afraid I've lost my spirit. Don't worry, be grateful that the future will hold whatever your heart desires. There's been so much pain. - The sorrow will diminish, the future will lessen the misery you're now enduring. Remember, you can take courage from the memory of Robert. - And now that he's dead, how do I pick up the pieces? Oh no! Isn't there anything stronger to drink in this house? Of course, I'm sorry. Oh, try to understand, Brian. I'm so low, I need something to pick me up once in awhile. I know that I can pull myself together in time, but I need a little freedom after what I've been through. - I think I oughta remind you that this kind of freedom isn't very good for your nervous system. I'm worried that things could be messy due to a problem turning up in the formal procedure in New York. I don't ever wanna go back to New York. So, have you liquidated the estate? My dear girl, I've told you 10 times, two petroleum companies, four television stations, a chain of department stores, they're not items you can unload as you would a truck. It's a big job and I need time. All right, Brian, I'll rely on you. - The only thing that might cause a grievance is the family mansion on Lake Michigan. I've just heard from relatives of Robert. Oh, a horrible, cold, old barn. I could never stand being there. - Uh, the letter was from Robert's two old aunts. They're dead set against selling it. Why don't they buy it? - Because they consider it property of the family. Hmm, oh, it's not important to me. I'll give it to them. This you could do. Of course, on the other hand, it might be best to get the two old ladies out of our hair promptly. I'd recommend you take it easy and don't worry so much. I'll telephone from New York and assign our best attorneys to settle the probate. Oh, thank you, Brian. You're a treasure. Teresa. Signora. - Take that thing away, I don't want it in here. It's messy in the cellar. I don't care where you put it as long as I never have to see it or hear it. Here are the pills, Signora West. A journalist has telephoned to see you. Questions, questions, I'm sick of them. They can go to hell. Oh, I've got such a headache. Better try resting. Howdy, everyone! Good morning, Madam. How are your kids doing? This is Signora West's villa, what is it you want? Please, I need tools and a telephone, but you know that I'm cordially penitent, Signora. You see here a daring poor pilgrim in a miserable guise. I'm sorry, but it's impossible to help. - Please, countess, be nice, I'll tell you, I can fix the motor alone. My passion is automobiles. Well, I've already told you- Teresa. Yes, Mrs. West? Give the young man what he needs, then send him away. Bravo, Signora West! - Now, now, now. Hey. - You talking to me? Cut her that rose. - What rose? - That one. Pick it and take it to Mrs. West. My name's Peter Donovan. Screwdriver. Pliers. It's a matter of speaking the same language. Well, that does it. You mean you finished so fast? Not on your life. It's inexorably broken. Have to get a new part. Oh. To your wonderful eyes. By the way, why don't you let me see them? Is it necessary? Not at all, I'll take you on your word. No, the word wasn't enough. All right, never mind. How far is it to town? I don't know. Two or three miles, maybe four. Marvelous, I was afraid it was 50. I'm sorry about having to leave the car here, but I'll be back tomorrow morning with a mechanic. It's all right. Would you like me to have Teresa drive you in? - No, no, no, I'd prefer walking on my hands. Well, so long. What are you doing here? - Trying to sleep and then I just happened to bump into the horn. Sorry! But I don't understand. Didn't you go into town? You bet, six miles. 7,000 lira to pay for a new part, and if the mechanic could come it would've taken 12. I just had 7. I see. In other words, you didn't have the money for a hotel room. It happens at least once in your life. Just a moment. Yes? Hello? Oh, it's you, Brian. I was afraid you wouldn't call. Saturday, perfect. Uh, let's see, today is- Wednesday. Yes, that's, that's right, Wednesday. All right, dear, I'll see you then. Right, good bye. Haven't you been taught that it's rude to enter a house without being invited? I was just looking. After all, masterpieces are to be looked at, otherwise why bother painting them? Well, I paint for myself. Besides, I'm not a professional. It's perfect. You used a mirror, right? You've got a rather unusual bellybutton, just like the Botticelli Venus. Oh, stop it. Besides, what do you know about painting? You're not an art critic, are you? ' Why not? What do you know about me? You're right. In fact, I'm not a critic, not even an intellectual. But I've forgotten all my manners, I'm hungry as a wolf, and wolves do not apologize. Goodnight, Miss West. Oh, wait a minute. All right, stay here. But don't touch anything. That's all I could find, but it should be enough for a wolf. I didn't feel I should wake the housekeeper. - You needn't have gone through the trouble. Here's a drink if you feel like it. Thank you. There, you can settle down here. I hope you'll forgive me if I don't have a pair of pajamas your size. - I always sleep naked and I like the women I sleep with to sleep naked, too. I see. Well, goodnight. Oh, be careful. I don't want that old witch to catch on to anything. Well, I do. You're a free woman. What's more, you pay her. Why are you afraid of her? - One has to be afraid of everything these days. Especially when one's happy. Besides, things are not easy for me now. But you are a widow, aren't you? As of seven weeks. - I suppose you loved your husband very much, didn't you? He died suddenly in a car crash. - Very wisely, otherwise we wouldn't be here. Poor Robert. He was a good man, but closed. All he ever thought about was money. And you married him for money? No, I needed affection. I thought an older man could give it to me, but all he knew how to give was money. - You want some advice to save your soul? Mmhmm. Give away all the money you've got, but not to the poor, to somebody richer than you. We need not create rich people anymore than there already are. She's coming back, later. - Well, Miss West, have a nice trip and give London a smile. Thank you. If you're ever in the neighborhood, do stop in. Goodbye. Clear everything away, Teresa. That's all for tonight. Peter? Is that you, Peter? Peter? Oh no! Are you afraid of getting dirty? Oh, yes. Yes, do it, soil me. Peter, oh, Peter. Don't move. And don't say anything. Wait, Teresa, I'll answer it. As you wish. And make me some strong black coffee. Si, Signora. Hello? - Kathryn? - Brian! Shall I meet your plane? - No, I prefer to drive, wait for me there. - Don't forget you're meeting Robert's aunts. - Oh yes, don't worry, I'll wear the soberest dress I have. Fine, see you in London. Right, bye! Peter, hurry, you've got to leave right away. Okay, but what's your trouble? Oh, I'm in a terrible rush. If you stay, I'll never get to London. Look, please don't be offended, Peter, but I would like you to be in a position of independence until I get back. Here, take it. - Were you used to being paid before you married the rich man? - Oh, forgive me, it's just my maternal instinct. Please go now, quietly. Okay, my would-be mother. - When I get back from London, will we see each other again? - It's up to you, if you want me, just call. Piazza Navona 19, top floor. There's no phone, but the mailman comes. - We've reached an accord that's perfectly rational. The result is that the family mansion becomes your property. In exchange, are you disposed to renounce all legal demands on the estate of your nephew Robert? - I think so- - No, no, that's not so. I'm not going to renounce the legacy we expected. I would absolutely contest any attempt to oppose the will of the passed. - Mr. Osbourne, could we buy the house? Legally, yes, but you'll have to meet the price. Then it's simpler to do as I say. - On the contrary, the West mansion is worth more than mere money. But Kathryn was his wife. It had the honor of having Lincoln as a guest one night. - After all, it is the West family's oldest possession. - And we cannot forget the sentimental value. - But we cannot equate sentimentality with economics. - Let's hear what Kathryn has to say. - Oh, my dear aunties, the only thing I know is that my poor Robert would've wanted me to give you the family house. - Oh no, irregardless, we Wests don't want any charity, legal or personal. But Janet, don't be too offended. It was just and generous of our precious niece- I have no nieces. Our poor dear Robert is gone. She's only the widow of my nephew. - Poor Robert, he never lived to enjoy his life. - A young woman and an older man, it wasn't right. You, Kathryn! Please, a glass of water. Here's his telegram. This is from the brokers for Delta Petroleum. For the Pasadena residence, I can hope for the best, even better than New York. These are the Brazilian oil leases for the counsel to administer during litigation, et cetera. You can rest assured that you'll be even richer. Oh, you must be mad. Oh, where's my angel? Come on, princess, you're invited to dinner. By whom? A lonely man who's fascinated by you, but who feels he's not worthy of your attention. Hello? Telegram? Destination, please. Uh, Rome. Piazza Navona 19. Urgent. Yes, the message, please? Uh. Yes, yes, please? I'm sorry, I've changed my mind. Oh. Who's there? Teresa, is that you? Let me out! Let me out! Teresa! Teresa, help! - Signora West! - There! Oh, Teresa. What caused you to scream? There's someone in the house, Teresa. Come along. Teresa, there's someone in the house! - Come on, come on, come on, come on. But I tell you, I can't have been dreaming. The shower was on, the window was open. And look there, the painting was always there. Somebody must've taken it upstairs! You're not well tonight. You're feeling terribly anxious, but it's only temporary. Don't drive yourself crazy. - The lights were on and then they went off. In other words, you don't believe me. How can I when you depend so much on pills to help you escape from reality? You need rest, Signora West. Go to your room, you'll feel better soon. Hello? Hello! Hello! And the mountain came to Muhammad. You might've at least called. You hear anything? It was cut off two months ago. No. I'm angry with you. No, not here. Yes, here! I didn't make any fuss about your damn rich house. I live here, I bring my women here on this bed. Women like that? You're worse than she is. Much worse. Yeah, that's right. I'm worse than she is. I'm worse than all of them. Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Oh yes. I'm the worst. Hurt me. Oh yes, hurt me. No! No, that's enough! No more whores, now you better get her out! - Stop it, you ass, can't you see she's a lady? I ain't no fool. Hit the road, you impotent moron. You can't understand these things. - I ask you to forgive me, this is my house. I put this guy up because he told me he's got trouble, then for three months he doesn't pay. Come on, let's go, let's get up. Not so fast. If you want these, pay up. - Who cares, it won't go anywhere, there's no gas. How much does he owe you, please? 60,000 lira rent, then 18,000 more I lent him to play poker. So you got yourself a beautiful meal ticket at last, eh? No, don't! Thanks, dear lady, I'm sorry about this. Flowers for signora? Put it on the bill. Hey! Are you trying to lose me after depriving me of a roof? I don't find it funny. Why don't you behave decently and apologize? - Well, I didn't ask you to come here to Rome. Oh, stop it, Peter. I find the whole thing very distasteful. You're right, I'm sorry. Take it. Teresa, prepare the guest room. Mr. Donovan is spending a week with us. Hey, Eva! Ciao! Come on! I'd like you to meet my sister. Oh, I'm sorry! - Please, try to be more careful when you dance. Ah, Teresa, don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. Ha, she wants me to sleep. In my day I was fabulous. In my day I was famous for rock and roll. - This is your day, Kathryn, ours is yet to come. Peter's right. I'd give half my life to resemble you during the other half. If you only knew the admiration, the enormous attraction I feel for you, the melting sensation I get looking at you. So feminine, so beautiful. ♪ How love should be ♪ ♪ And the days we shared when you still cared ♪ - There, touching you to be sure you're real. That's a thrill. Oh, Eva. You have so much inside, you can even give it away to someone like me; rich, with no purpose in life, who doesn't deserve it. ♪ And so hopelessly ♪ Well, then! ♪ And hurt inside ♪ - If that's the way it's to be, teach me how to be young! ♪ But if only yet ♪ ♪ You'll not forget ♪ ♪ That I'd still wait for you ♪ - Good for you, come on! ♪ I don't, I don't ♪ ♪ But then, but then ♪ - Watch it, girl, go on! ♪ You doubted me ♪ ♪ And you lied to me ♪ ♪ And so hopelessly ♪ Oh, it's wonderful to be young. ♪ I hid the pride and hurt inside ♪ ♪ Aware you'd still be gone ♪ ♪ But if only yet ♪ - Hold it! ♪ You'd not forget ♪ - Oh no, you monster! Don't use the flash. You'll burn everything out on me and we'll turn out looking dreadful. It has a special film that takes photos in this light. Now, you can do whatever you want. Does it have an automatic shutter? Of course. Come on! All together, a family group. So, Eva, how do you like the house? It's lovely here. Silent, enchanting. It reminds me of our grandparent's house in Beverly Hills. - It's an old dreary house full old folks and dogs. Oh, he's lying. I bet he's longing to go back. He's always doing that. When he loves something he says he hates it. Mm, at last. Not for me, thank you. I am no teetotaler, but when I drink on an empty stomach I don't trust myself to drive. But where do you have to go? Well, back to Rome, I suppose. - Oh, not at all, I've already arranged dinner here, unless you have something more important to do. I don't think there's anyone more important than you, Kathryn. At least for the moment. Oh, well then, come on, have a drink. You won't be driving anywhere tonight. ♪ Oh, anytime ♪ ♪ You need some love, just tell me ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, anytime ♪ ♪ You're feeling down, just tell me ♪ ♪ Yeah, anytime ♪ ♪ I'll come around, just tell me ♪ ♪ Don't worry ♪ ♪ Baby, 'cause I'm the one ♪ ♪ I'll be there to turn your sadness into fun ♪ ♪ Late at night when it's dark ♪ ♪ And so cold ♪ ♪ Girl, I'll promise you the warmest ♪ ♪ Hand to hold ♪ ♪ So, anytime ♪ ♪ You need some love, just tell me ♪ ♪ Yeah, anytime ♪ ♪ You feel alone, just tell me ♪ ♪ Don't worry ♪ ♪ Baby, 'cause I'm the one ♪ ♪ I'll be there to turn your sadness into fun ♪ ♪ Late at night when it's dark ♪ ♪ And so cold ♪ ♪ Girl, I promise you the warmest ♪ ♪ Hand to hold ♪ ♪ Anytime you need some love, just tell me ♪ ♪ Yeah, anytime ♪ ♪ You feel alone, just tell me ♪ ♪ Don't worry ♪ ♪ Girl, 'cause I will run ♪ ♪ I'll be there to turn your sadness into fun ♪ ♪ Tell me, baby ♪ ♪ Come on, tell me ♪ ♪ Girl, tell me, baby ♪ ♪ Come on and tell me ♪ ♪ Whoa, come on and tell me, baby ♪ ♪ Why don't you tell me ♪ ♪ Come on, just tell me, baby ♪ ♪ Come on, tell me ♪ ♪ Why don't you just tell me, baby ♪ ♪ Come on and tell me ♪ ♪ Why don't you come tell me, baby ♪ ♪ Come on, tell me ♪ ♪ Why don't you just tell me, baby ♪ ♪ Come on, any day ♪ Oh, I wish I didn't feel so tired. It's a pity to break up a night like tonight. Look, I've got some pills that make you stop feeling tired. I took one in the nightclub. It should be taken with four fingers of whiskey. Eva, I'd like to give her a kiss. May I? You must. Oh, not now, darling. - You must never say no to a guest, Kathryn. Why should you hide when you make love? There's so many ridiculous and repulsive things, and love is the most beautiful in the world. Quite right, sis. Just think, there's people who count their money in public. People who slug each other in the ring. People who make war. - How long is it since you've made love, sis? - I never remember the last time, I only think of the next. - What you've done in the past seems like nothing compared to what you'd like to do. Now, I order you to go to bed. I will take your word for it. Come on, Kathryn. Kathryn! Wake up, darling, it's four in the afternoon. Oh, let me sleep. Please. Come on, you've got to wake up. Oh, I can't. You'll end up harming yourself. Take this, you'll feel better in a moment. Your move, Kathryn. Yes? Yes, here she is. Hello? Hello, Brian, how are you? No, don't worry, they're two kids from Boston. Yes, the children of a friend of mine. Tomorrow evening? Perfect. Till tomorrow night, then. No, I'll come there. Right, bye. Try and leave us and I'll bump you off. Stop that! Moron. But Peter, it was only a joke. I don't tolerate jokes with guns! And I don't tolerate brutality! You prefer she shot you, you idiot? How dare you speak to me like that! And you keep your voice down, all the Brooklyn comes out in you. Brooklyn. - I don't want you two to quarrel because of me. Oh, it's not because of you. It's because of me. Come on, let's drop it. Oh, that's too easy. Is that what you did as a little boy? - Always, but he means it when he says he's sorry. - Well, there's nothing really to be sorry about anyway. Come on! Oh, stop it, Peter! Goodnight. Good loving. Peter. - Perhaps, dear Kathryn, worry comes from caring. Mm, that's very sweet of you, Brian, but there's really no need to worry. I feel much better now. You know, these two youngsters have been marvelous for me. They've given me a new perspective on life and youth. That so? To be young requires the company of the young. Excuse me, I didn't mean to sound like such an old man. Oh, that's not true. But I must tell you frankly, Brian, I have no intention of getting married again. I'm not asking you to marry me. - No, but you were about to when I stopped you. Anyway, you'll always be the closest person to me. I'll never let you go. I've always felt the same way about you. What's that? - Oh, it's just something for the digestion. I've had a problem with my liver lately. That's why I would like to go home early, if possible. Welcome back, you tramp. No, no, no, no, no! Can you talk, Signora West? Can you say anything? What happened? Are you all right, Signora West? Do you feel any better? This is Teresa. Please, say something. Do you want me to make you a cup of hot tea? Ah, good. Here, drink. Can you say anything? You may have a concussion. I just tripped, Teresa. It's nothing, I'll be all right. Go back to bed, we'll look after her. Come on. We didn't lie to you before. My father and Eva's father were good friends, our mothers too. To the point that they divorced and married each other, so we grew up together, school together, vacations together, bed together, ever since we were children. It's disgusting. You've deceived me so. You've helped us yourself. What? Are you jealous of something? I'm the one who should be, but jealously does not exist. - Especially in the particular situation we're in. Why did you come here, Eva? - I wanted to see who was stealing Peter from me. And when I saw you, I realized he was right, and you made me fall in love, too. I made you fall in love? There are all kinds of love. And all sorts of pleasures. When you came we were thinking about you as if you were here with us. I was here with you? ♪ I don't know when ♪ ♪ I don't know when ♪ ♪ I don't know, I don't know when ♪ ♪ I don't know when ♪ ♪ I don't know ♪ ♪ I don't know, I don't know ♪ ♪ I don't know when ♪ ♪ I don't know, I don't know ♪ Signora West. - Yes, what is it? - Your breakfast, signora.

You have need of anything, Signora West? No, just some sleep. - Only the free man doesn't need anyone to wait on him. - We can get along perfectly well by ourselves without that old bag spying on everything we say and do. Oh, but that's out of the question. Why? You're going off on a cruise and you're closing down the house. And you mean we stay here alone? No, Martino stays on. He lives with his flowers, and besides, he's deaf. - Tell me, Kathryn, before making up your mind, did you like it? Si. The Signora doesn't live here now. Don't have the slimmest idea. I'd like to be quite frank.

What do you think of yourself? Well, what do I think of myself? When I think of myself I wanna vomit, but I'm happy because I realize it. You see, you two don't realize how nauseating you are. There, I've told the truth. That makes us both more nauseating. Why did you do that? Get out of the way, let's drink. Come on, it's all over, Kathryn. It's only a game. - Yes, a game, game of truth, and I told the truth. You won't screw me anymore with your drugs. You slimy little bastards! You won't have my neck! Go find somebody else for your degenerate games, and get out of my house! I never wanna see you again. You filth! I loathe you. Martino, do you hear me? Take this away! Don't forget, open the gate at five sharp. But before and after that, don't open it for anyone! Five o'clock? Five! All righty. What's the meaning of this? Leave at once! All right, how much do you want? She asked how much we want. How much does she think she's worth? I knew it was blackmail. I haven't got time to lose, I'm expecting guests. Say what you want and get out. We don't want your money, we want you. It was certainly fortunate for Kathryn that when Teresa suddenly walked out on her, she discovered you two. - No doubt, it's very peaceful in this desert. Desert? Miss West, what do you mean? This is an earthly paradise. I'm majoring in botany. I've never seen any place as rich in fungi of all kinds. Oh, really? What are your interests, Signorina Donovan? Well, music, photography, too, but actually I'm sort of, well, an old fashioned girl, and I think I am too young to take a serious interest in anything. I feel much pleasure whenever I hear such words from the younger generation- No, no, not at all, young lady, continue on with those principles and you'll wind up like us, taking care of alcoholics without ever having had the pleasure of getting drunk. Are you feeling better, dear? Oh, much better, thank you. In fact, I jotted down the notes you asked for. What papers? About the oil company. If you start losing your memory, Brian, I'll be forced to hire another attorney. Oh yes, I forgot, I'm sorry. Good, then it's possible to proceed. Now, these are the details concerning the state of the villa. Now, your approval is necessary to complete the matter. Please, sign here. - We expect to see you in London, Kathy, dear. Bye! - Bye, see you Michigan! Maybe the springtime. - And also, I'm very grateful for the concern you've shown for Kathryn. For us it's a pleasure, Mr. Sanders. Kathryn is so sweet and unhappy. - I'll telephone tomorrow from the airport. Don't forget, please call. Ciao. "Come back alone as soon as you can." "I'm in danger." Shut the gate. Here, give this to her. - Magnificent, that would even give a kick to the rotting Mr. West. You'd give all your stinking millions to have a taste of this. Wouldn't you, Kathryn? I'm sure you'd give all your filthy millions away for a sip of this drink. We don't want them, we like you. Sweet and agreeable as you were long, long ago. - That's all over now, and I don't feel like drinking. - You're a liar, Mrs. West, you do feel like it, except you're also afraid. This is the most exciting moment of your life! - Why don't you surprise me and ask to have a drink? Stop it! - What do you promise me if I let you drink? Stop it. Do you hear that? She wants to stop before we've even started. Hello, Brian! Hello, Brian, can you hear me now? Oh, no no no, please, please. Oh, no, no, no, don't hang up, Brian, stay on the line. What? Hello, Brian? Oh, the letter. Oh, it's nothing important, I just wanted to hear about the dividends. Oh, well, it was nothing important, I just wanted to know about the dividends.

Come with me. I don't want to, I want the keys. Where are the keys to my car? I'll give you the keys, come with me. They weren't there before. - You're suffering from hallucinations, Kathryn.

You wanted to be alone with your vices and your booze? Well, you got it all. You're really something, you know that? Gotta save a life now. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Wait a moment! Oh, thanks. Is it yours? - Yes, she's been missing since this morning. I'm living down the way. - Where are you going? Go back to bed. No, let me by. No, let me by! - No. - Let me by. You! The hold, damn you! - Let go! You, stop it! Damn you. Stop it! Stop it! I'm leaving now, see you later. - Yeah? - Thanks again. Who's that? Oh, the Signore. All the time he passes by here we talk away... Here, go into town and get some cigarettes. Go on! Oh no. Don't beat me, no. Oh no. Oh no! No, please! Oh, please! Oh no. Stop! Stop! Martino! No, don't go away! Don't leave me! Martino! Wait! Martino! Don't go away! Don't leave me! Martino! Thank you, Signora. Thank you very much! Bye. There's not a drop left in the house. Have you forgotten all our wonderful evenings? Where's the telephone? We're against technological progress and we don't wanna be disturbed. Oh, put the telephone back at once. I wanna order some whiskey. Eva's gone in to land a supply, but if you're really thirsty, I'll see what I can do. And I warn you, there's a padlock on the gate! Here we are! But if you wanna drink you've gotta be nice. No, no, don't come any closer. Well, I was just trying to be nice. The fact is that we really don't have any more fun with you because you're a poor demented drunk! Hey, bring me a glass now. Actually, you're a pretty nice girl. Get up. Stand up. Give me the keys to the gate and the keys to the car. Don't do anything silly, Kathryn. Stop there! Throw me the keys and then lock yourself inside. - Damn the day I ever got the idea of using red dye. You can thank me for having thought of putting in those blanks. How is she? - She's just waking up, the sedative was weak. Be careful, huh? This isn't the moment. Don't worry, it's pure science. Hello? Yes. West residence. Ah, good evening, Mr. Sanders. She's gone to Rome with my sister. She's gone to do some shopping. I see. Well, I hope she'll be, that she'll be back by that time. Okay? Be seeing you soon. - I'm sorry, darling, but I had to stop you from saying anything funny. - You've done too many funny things already. Now, Mr. Sanders is on his way and you've got to get rid of him. Brian's coming here? Quite right. You have to behave, and if you say one thing, we spill the beans. Brian's coming here? - But no, our little Kathy will be perfect. Now, get up and get yourself into shape. God save you if you let yourself be seen in this condition. No, later. Now you've got to get up and get dressed. - I'm terribly sorry, but I absolutely must be in New York tomorrow morning. - I don't know what to say, Mr. Sanders. Every time they go to Rome they get lost in the shops, go to the movies, stop by in some restaurants. Quite frankly, I'm pretty fed up with trying to keep up with those live wires. Maybe it's better that way. Kathryn needs a little distraction. How is she now? Well, I don't know really what to say. Sometimes she seems perfectly well, and then she gets sudden fits of depression. Forgive me, Mr. Sanders, perhaps I shouldn't- No, no, tell me the truth, I beg you. - Well, when she gets sad she drinks a lot, and when she drinks a lot she says she wants to die. Then, uh- - Then? - Then she takes sleeping pills and she sleeps for 24 hours a day. Yes, we really must convince her to take a cure. I'm very worried, and I'd be very grateful, Mr. Donovan, if you'd always keep me informed. In any case, I'll be back in a week at the most. - What about the power of attorney? Thank you, and tell Kathryn to sign this and dispatch it immediately to the office of Carlini, who's my correspondent in Rome. - And should Signora West have need of clarification, this is my number to telephone. - Mr. Donovan, you've been a considerable help, now what Kathryn wanted to know is what the total dividends come to. Tell her these papers concern 120 million in the Italian branch. I see, 120 million. What was that? - Uh, the cat's up to his old trick of trying to steal a bottle of milk. - Oh, well, tell Kathryn, uh, Mrs. West, to call me. Goodbye. Goodbye, gentlemen! See you, Mr. Sanders. Keep your millions, you filthy bitch! If she doesn't get it over with quick, I'm going out of my mind. It depends on you. It's up to the last stage now. What is it? Quick, answer the bell! Telegram for you. Too bad you're so crazy, you're so beautiful. I could've loved you and made you happy. All the fault of whiskey. Would you like to make love one last time? Only you and me. Kathryn, your supper's ready. Let me out, I'm going mad! I'm going mad! 20 pills. It'll be a painless suicide. It's our sad duty to inform you of the death of your legal representative Brian Sanders. Oh no! In a plane crash returning home. Oh, God! Oh, God, no! This is it. Let's wait at least 10 minutes. Okay. A real shame. She was so beautiful. Peter, get to town and find a doctor. Make a scene, act desperate. Call my hotel in Rome and leave an urgent message. I'll be there in one hour and we'll meet again in two. Here. Put these on her nightstand. Clean the place up. Get rid of the whiskey. She's pumped full of barbiturates, what if they want to do an autopsy? Don't worry. Put the pills in a drawer and lock it up. Hide the key in her room. Don't forget to wear gloves. Farewell, Kathryn. Holiday's over. "I, Kathryn West, being of sound mind and body, adopt Peter Donovan and Eva Stuart, who managed to fill the hole of my painful loneliness with their love. I name them the sole heirs of my assets, along with my dear friend and attorney Brian Sanders." This is for the change of address. No text yet, I'll fill it in when I get to New York. "The amount of my total assets is specified in the following papers..." Uncle Brian, lend us the car. Absolutely, kids. - If I don't get into the water, I'll explode. - It's a beautiful day for swimming. - You two deserve the best. - You're a darling. Ciao. See you later. Excuse me, Mr. Sanders? You're wanted at Scotland Yard. My dear Mr. Sanders, when a millionaire like Robert West dies in a car accident, there's always an investigation. And often a very discreet one at that. The New York police have conducted a detailed investigation ever since that tragic day. After a technical report on the wreck they concluded, without a shadow of a doubt, that someone tampered with the brakes of the car. Therefore, poor Robert West was a victim of foul play. Furthermore, it has been discovered that, on the day of the accident, Mr. West was going to his attorney in New York to file for divorce against his wife. Divorce? Correct. And those millions of dollars at stake made a good motive for the wife. We finally managed to find a briefcase in Mrs. West's house with enough evidence linking her to the crime. Lieutenant Arthur Frank deserves all the credit for solving the case. He's a member of New York's District Attorney's office. - Pleased. - A spouse's murderer cannot inherit their victims' belongings. Therefore, Mr. West's London-based aunts will inherit his whole estate. Following these developments, we've decided to reopen the case concerning Mrs. West's strange suicide. Come on! We're running out of gas! What do you care? We've got 3000 oil wells out in Texas! We could double the price of oil.
