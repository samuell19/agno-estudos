Subtitles by explosiveskull Yo, yo, check out what this girl DM'ed me on Twitter. - Oh. - Hot, right? Oh, yeah, she's, uh, not leaving anything to the imagination. You must get these from time to time, yeah? Yeah, lots and lots. How many followers you have? 43,978. 79. You probably got a bunch after all these years, I bet. Yeah, yeah, it's... it's up there. I lost count though. Oh, you could just check real quick on your phone. Nah, it's cool. I'll check later. No, it's easy. All you got to do is... Later, Alex, later. So September 1st? - That's the date, right? - Yeah. For five or six lucky souls, that's the date. Do you know who's getting called up? Why would I know that? You've been in the club the longest. Figure if anyone would know, you would. Well, I don't. Do you think I got a shot? Shit, if she's sending you pictures like that, she's pretty much begging for it. No, at... at getting called up. I don't have a good track record at predicting these things. Got a dip? You don't have to pretend to be asleep. Pretend? I'm not pretending. It's fine. I'm leaving. Who asked you to leave? You are, right now. You're not facing me. I'm not facing you 'cause I was sleeping. Em. Hey. I don't know what you want from me. - I want you to turn over. - I turned over. - Yeah, not genuinely. - I didn't turn over genuinely? Come on, what are we talking about here? You know, every night you're not on the road, you call me over; we have sex; I get dressed while you pretend to sleep; and then I leave. And it's not a big deal... It sounds like it's a big deal. Of course it's a big deal. You know, anytime someone says, "It's not a big deal," they really mean it is, otherwise they wouldn't bring it up. So, what is it that you're bringing up, then? That this isn't fun anymore? You know, the first three months, sure, that was fun, but the last three? It's pathetic. You know this is my career. I can't help that I'm constantly on the road. I... I could get called up at any minute. I have to be ready. You've been saying that since the first day I met you. - And it's true. - Maybe it is. But you've been at this for 12 years already? It's not an easy business. It should be a little bit easier than this. Good, good. The only thing I'd say is, on this one, when you're coming through, palm up, palm down, remember? All right, go for it. Nice. - 80, right? - Right, thank you. Jake's getting a lot better. - He loves working with you. - Yeah. Tonight's the last game of the season, right? Right, right. You guys gonna be able to make it? I wish we could, but Steve and I have our first PTA meeting of the year, - Okay. - But before you know it, we'll be back watching you again in the spring. Right. Right, in the spring. - Well, good luck tonight. - Thanks. Back seat, buddy. - No! - Yes, you know. - Mom... - Come on. If Dwarn pats you on the shoulder to head into Skip's office, it means you're going up. Good for Colsey. Yeah, good for him. Alex, Skip wants to see you. Thanks. It'll come. Dustin. Alex comes out, you're up. I just... I wanted to say, thank you for e... Dustin. You've given the organization, what, 12 years now? Yep, yep. Like you said, I just had to keep at it and keep believing. So you know better than anybody this is a game of statistics. Man, I lobbied for you. It's... It's not your defense they're worried about. You're a good catcher. It's... Your batting average just isn't where it needs to be. I wanted you to hear it from me. You deserve that. There's always next year. - There he is. - It's about time! Aw, Dusty. Oh, I'm so sorry. Well, maybe next year, right? Ma, are you there? Yeah, yeah, I'm here. I just said, "Maybe next year." Dustin, we talked about this. You said you'd give it till you're 30. I don't recall ever specifying the beginning of 30. You turn 30 next week. And do what, Ma? I've never had a backup plan. Why don't you come home? Home? What's in Brampton? Me, your sister, your friends. My friends I haven't seen or spoken to in over a decade, Mom. Well, but maybe this is exactly what you need, You know, a chance to regroup and figure out your next steps. You must have given some thought into life after baseball. So good to have you home, honey. Oh, your sister and Allyson are coming to dinner tonight too. So have you let your friends know that you're back home? No, I told you, I haven't talked to them in a long time. - What about Rachel? - What about her? - Have you spoken to her? - No. Oh. "Oh" what? Nothing. Sorry, I just... I didn't know what kind of terms you two were on - since she moved back home... - No-no-no, no. What's, uh... what's going on with her? Oh, she seems... she seems good. She's dating somebody. She's, uh, managing her dad's ice cream store. - She is? - Yeah. But they've turned it into this kind of low-sugar, no-sugar kind of thing. Everybody's doing that now. It's, like, organic... - No, no, I mean... - No salt, no sugar... I mean, she's... she's dating someone? Oh, that's right, you are not on Facebook. I've gotten in touch with so many friends from my past. Ma, who's... who's the guy? Oh, Eddie Wachtell. Eddie Wachtell? Who's Eddie Wachtell? He is the new town dentist, very nice. Ma, I... is this guy your dentist? Well, who else am I gonna see? I don't know, just maybe not my ex's boyfriend. Dustin, I'm not gonna drive 10 miles out of the way to go to the next-closest dentist. Besides, Eddie's very, very gentle. Oh, you want me to make an appointment with him while you're here? I'll drive the 10 miles. Oh, no, you will not in front of me! Give me that. Give it here. None of that in my house. What was that? Yes, Mom. Here we are, baby. Home sweet home. Oh, gosh, let me get that. I'll be right back. Okay. What's with all the boxes? Yeah, he's here. Yup. So, Dustin, when did you become a vegetarian? I'm not a vegetarian. I just... I don't eat red meat. - Oh. - That's weird. Why is that weird, Jane? It's just weird, Dustin. We always ate red meat growing up. Okay, so look, he doesn't eat red meat anymore, and there's nothing wrong with that. We are always evolving. Thank you, Allyson. I guess part of this evolution of yours, Dustin, is realizing that minor league baseball doesn't pay the bills. - Jane! - What? I am agreeing with him. I mean, 'cause we all really do change. It's just gonna be tough for a 30-year-old without a college degree to get a job. Jane. I stopped eating red meat five years ago after Dad died of a heart attack. So we've covered the red meat, the job talk. What's next on the docket? Okay, Dustin, Jane. - Look, please, not tonight? - Tell her to lay off me. I'm just giving you a sense of the real world. - Okay, that's enough. - The real world is... That is enough. That is enough! We're not gonna be that family. We're finally all together, and I want it to stay that way. Sorry. Dust, I... I have to tell you something. Your sister and Allyson, um, already know. Know what? Yup, we've been dating for about a year now. - Isn't that right, Love Bug? - Oh, 11 1/2 months. But who's counting? Sorry, your names are what again? Oh, I'm Bart, and this is Cody. I can say my own name. Okay. - Cody. - Got you. Uh, Ma, why didn't you tell me about Bart and Cody? Just thought it would be better if you all met first. But a year is a long time to not say anything. Technically 50 weeks. Who's counting? Well, we're all meeting now. When you are finished recording, hang up or press one for more options. Ra... Rachel, how are you? It is Dustin, Dustin Kimmel. I just wanted to reach out. And, uh, I don't know if you've heard... you, uh, you probably have heard, actually. Uh, Mom's been telling the whole town by now, I would say. Bit of a chatterbox, that one. Anyway, I just wanted to... I just wanted to give you a call, just see if you wanted to catch up, uh, maybe just get a drink... martini, three olives, rinse of vermouth, your favorite. Uh, or coffee. I could do coffee. If you want to do coffee, I could... I could do coffee, uhh, skim milk, two sugars. That's your coffee order. I remember. Anyway, uh, let me know if you want to catch up. Doesn't have to be over a coffee or martini, what have you. It's... You got my number. Just, uh, bell me a ring. And... I will talk to you soon. Be well. What the fuck was that? Robby? How are you, man? I'm back, back in old Brampton. Joe, what's up, man? It's Dustin. Dustin Kimmel. Dan the Man. How... Dustin. Brampton High, '05. Come on, man, the wife won't let you out? You... shut up. You have a kid? Since when... Two kids? I'm sorry, man. I... I didn't know that you were in recovery. Okay. That's... that's... that's, uh, pow... super, uh, respect that, man. Ooh. So, uh... Gav, what, uh, line of work you in? Oh, I am the managing director of Brampton Bowling Lanes. Yeah, after Blockbuster closed down... and fuck you, Netflix... I was like, "I'm starting my own businesses." I started a invisible dog fence business, and then nobody hired me. So bowling. It's a stable industry. It's recession-froo-proof. I get free beer, free food, free games. Like, if you ever want to come over, I will hook you up. Yeah. Yeah, for sure, man. - Yeah? - Yeah, I'll, uh... I'll, uh... I'll hit you up. But enough about me. What the hell are you doing, Brampton's own Dustin Kimmel? You in town visiting or something? No, I am... this is looking like this is permanent. Oh, yeah? They moving a farm team here? Nope. I am leaving baseball. - I'm retiring. - You can't quit. Not quitting, retiring. Yeah, but you're the best baseball player that ever came out of this town. - Yeah... - You got to go all the way. I mean, I would have made it to the pros if I didn't blow my knee out. - Yeah. - You know that. Yeah, yeah, I remember. You always used to tell us that at those parties you threw for us in high school. - Ah, those were the days. - You still doing that? You still throwing those parties for high schoolers? No. Fucking parents these days. You know, you introduce a little bit of molly to some mature 17-year-olds, and the whole town throws up their arms. It's not like anybody died. Well, that... that's good. You can't quit. I mean, I gotta live through you, man. I just... I'm almost 30. I got no money. I got nothing to show for the last, like, 12 years, and it just feels like everyone else is moving on, and I'm just stuck in the same place, you know what I mean? Sorry, what? Nothing. Oh. Hey, you remember my high school girlfriend, Rachel Kinley? Oh, fuck, yeah. She was a babe. You, uh, know anything about this Eddie... Eddie Wachtell? Great guy. - You're gonna love him. - Okay. Soft hands, soothing voice. He makes bank. - Okay. - He's a doctor. He's not a doctor. He's a dentist. Well, he wears rubber doctor gloves, so. If anything, they'd be rubber dentist gloves. You can't... you have to order those from, like, a doctor website. Gotcha. Get a beer, Jimmy. Hey, can I, uh... can I see that real quick? Jimmy, it's okay. He's the guy in the article. - What the hell? - What are you doing? You know how hard it is to get an article in this place? Sorry, we're closed. You should turn this around then. Hi. So that song was yours? Yeah. I thought so. It's nice to see that you're, uh, keeping up with it. Well, that was actually the last song I wrote. So you and big Gav out on the town, huh? Sadly, he, uh... he's the only one from around here who wants to hang out. Well, maybe if you had kept in touch with some of your old friends... You're telling me this ice cream's healthy? Healthier, yeah. I don't get it. Why change it? You guys... this place was an institution. People lined up out... out the door. This fake stuff can't compare to the real thing. Well, thank you for your concern, but we're... we're busy as ever. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I don't know how I feel about this. I think you know exactly how you feel about this. How are your knees? Still there. You still on pain meds? Do you get free dental or... how does that work? Oh, okay, so you're not wasting any time, huh? You're just gonna get right there. - Absolutely. - Mm-hmm. So how long are you home for? Couldn't really tell from your voice message. So you did get my voice message. Why didn't you call me back? You didn't answer my question. Well, I always said I was gonna give it till I was 30. Hm. I bought a one-way ticket. Your turn. I couldn't imagine why you were possibly calling. I mean, we haven't spoken in years. Couldn't I just be calling to say hi? Dustin Kimmel never just calls to say hi. Then why else would I be calling? Well, you're back, and, by the sounds of it, for good, and you're telling me that you've retired from the sport that kept us from starting a life together. I mean, there's really... really only one thing to think. Is it impossible to consider that maybe I've moved on? Have you? Please, tell me that you have and that I'm a crazy person for imagining this, and then I can get on with living my stable life with a man and a job that I am happy to have. Dustin? You're a crazy person. Okay, good. Thanks for the ice cream. Oh. That song. When did you write that, again? Three years ago. I think I remember it. It was nice to hear it again. Okay, thank you. Bye. Oh... no... No, I don't care if he's out of town. I... He's been rescheduling for... for weeks. Fine, I'll do the meeting on Friday. I just... I'm really not happy about it. It's a very, very busy schedule. Okay, thank you. Bye. Can you stop, please? Um, so you think I can just hand you a job? Honestly, I don't know what you can do, but I am here asking my older sister for help. You didn't even go to college. I mean, what makes you think that I can trust you to help me manage other people's money? Jane, you know how hard I work when I'm focused. Walk me around the office and call me an idiot all day long. I will do whatever you ask of me. Last in, first out. You know what I mean, the other way around. Hey, Barry, uh, can you come in here for a second? Hey. Can you tell me what a good reason to invest in a bond is? They offer a safe and reliable income stream? Did you know that? Yeah. Obviously. How about on the count of three you both tell me what ROI stands for? - One, two... - Wait, wait, wait, wait. R-O-I or R-O-Y? - What the hell is ROY? - Nothing. I just... it sounded like you said ROY, so I... I thought it was ROI. One, two, three. - Return on investment. - Radius one infiltration. Did you just say, "Radius one infiltration?" No. - Did you say that? - Uh, no. - Did... did you say it? - No. - R... you didn't? - No. Thank you, Barry. Okay. Was his answer right? Barry's an intern coffee runner. I couldn't possibly hire you. You're casting. You're casting your bat. Try and keep it inside. Look like you're going fishing. All right. Still fishing. Hey, try and keep it in close, keep your hands in close to your body, okay? As you're coming through, palm up, palm down. Try and make contact inside the ball, okay? You got it. Hey! - Like that? - Just like that. You, uh... you like baseball, huh? Yeah. There's not much else to do in this town during the summer. Right. - Where's your dad? - At work. What about your friends? I just moved here last year. I don't have many. Right. Why are you here? I grew up in these cages. I haven't been back for a while though. So I've heard. What have you heard? - That you're lost. - Who says I'm lost? No one, but that's what I conclude from the conversations I overhear between your mom and my dad. I think I know why you don't have many friends. - What does that mean? - Nothing. What about your dad? Why isn't he in the picture? - He died. - Oh. I'm sorry. It's okay. What about your mom? They fought a lot. I overheard him tell someone on the phone she's a whore. Oh. - You want to hang out? - Sure. That's pretty good. So are we gonna be, like, brothers or something? Well, you'd know better than me. I just found out about him yesterday. Oh. Look how cute you two are hanging out together. - You're throwing all this out? - Oh, honey. It's... it's all just been collecting dust for years. Ma, this is my stuff. This is my high school bat. You can't toss this. Okay, honey, just, you know, pick out a few things that you just really, really want to keep. These are the cleats I wore when I hit a walk-off home run in Double-A. Ma. This is the first glove Dad ever bought for me. Why are you tossing all of this? Oh, Dustin, I... I didn't know how to tell you this. I'm moving in with Bart and Cody. You're what? Did you know about this? Thanks for the heads up! Honey, the house is just too big, and the taxes are... - It sold last month. - It what? - Your mom's in escrow. - We close in two weeks. And then, we gotta be out of here. Yesterday I find out that you have a boyfriend. Today I find out you sold the house and you're moving in with him? It's a nice condo across the bay. Ma, this was the foul ball Big Papi hit at the 2004 ALCS game at Fenway I went to with Dad. Who's Big Papi? Cody, tell her who Big Papi is. David Ortiz. - He's a legend. - A legend. Cody, grab that bag. Where are you going with those? Traitor. So, uh, how long do we sit here for? Long enough for her to get the message. Aren't you quitting baseball? Retiring. And I am. Then why do you need all this stuff? It's part of my past. - You want to get some food? - Sure. Okay, I'm gonna get the pastrami panini. So why'd you come home? I told you. I retired. Right, but why home? Can't you go anywhere? Something wrong with Brampton? I don't know, you just don't seem very happy here. Well, we just met yesterday. What do you know about me? My teacher last year said I'm precautious. You mean precocious? Yeah, yeah, that one. Yeah, well, she's right. Oh, my. - What? - That girl's pretty. - No, don't look. - I'm sorry. She's two tables down at your 3:00. If you're gonna look, like, be cool about it. My back is just killing me. Yeah, she's cute. You should go and talk to her. Like she'd go for me. - She's probably into older guys. - What? Just give it a shot. What do I even say? Okay, there's a couple ways you can go about this. You can be sincere, or you can swing for the fences, say something that's gonna get her attention. I'm a swing-for-the-fences kind of guy. I had a feeling. All right, I had this teammate. He had this line, never failed him. - Mm-hmm? - He'd go up to a girl. And he'd say, "I want to eat you like a watermelon." Are you supposed to eat a watermelon differently than other foods? You know what? Let's, uh, table that one for now. Just say whatever you feel comfortable saying. - Okay. - Go get her. Hey... Thank you. How'd it go? - Good. - Good? - Yeah. - Get her number or... I got her Instagram. We're following each other now. - That's... that's good, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. Hey. What'd you say? Tell your friend his watermelon line is foolproof. Wait, you actually... you said that? Yeah. Oh... Can you tell me what it means? I have no idea what I just said. Actually, I think I might just get the, uh... Just don't talk, okay? Okay. We can't meet at the Brampton Diner. It's a small town. Since when can't we be seen together in public? Eddie proposed to me this morning. And you said? - Is that a yes? - Yes, it's a yes. What... what do you think this means? - So what are you doing here? - To tell you how it's gonna go. - How what's gonna go? - My life. - How your life's gonna go? - I don't have time for this. - I just got engaged. - I can tell. You're beaming. Look, I'm gonna get married, and I'm gonna live in Brampton with my loving husband; and we're gonna have three kids, two boys and a girl; and they are gonna grow up to be thoughtful and responsible, and they might work at their father's dental office during the summers, or maybe at their mom's ice cream shop. I... I don't know. We're gonna let them make that decision, because we want them to think for themselves, but we will be firm but fair. And we're gonna do our best to welcome their husbands and wives - into our lives... - Wait-wait-wait... - Whose husbands and wives? - My kids'. We were just at summer internships. Now we're at marriages? It's all good, just seems like we're jumping around a bit. - It's your world. - Can I finish? Sure. And that's how it's gonna go. - Are you done? - Yes. What kind of house are you gonna build, American Colonial? I always saw you in more of a Chalet bungalow... You're such a prick. - Hey, hey-hey... - I hate you. I fucking hate you for making me wait. You broke up with me, remember? You wouldn't wait any longer. Yeah, I may have done the breaking up, but it was because I was so tired of you choosing the game over me. And I waited for you to come around, and you never did! Hey, hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. Listen, if I could go back and change it, I would. Believe me. Believe me. I'm sorry. I'm marrying Eddie, okay? - Roll... wait. - I get to draw a card - Draw a card. - Am I ever... Yeah, so you went... Where are you going? - Out. - Can I come? Sure. - Okay, what do we have? - Oh, he's winning. Oh, he's killing us. Here, hive him mine. Sure, go for it. Can I take a few? Yeah, get in here. You're casting again. Cody, hands inside, okay? Cody, hands inside. - Keep your hands in... - I'm trying! Try harder. Focus. Keep them inside. Cody! Watch. Watch, watch. Relax the arms, strong in the legs. Drop and drive. You want to be a good hitter? You have to practice the right way every single day. When your friends are off hanging out after practice, that's when you get back in the cage. Put in the extra work! Friends will come and go, but this game only gives you so many opportunities. It's not how good you want to be. It's how good you're willing to be! Fuck! You like this ice cream? I mean, it's no Clean Sweets, but it's good. Clean Sweets. They make fake ice cream, you know? This stuff, this is the real deal, real sugar, real ingredients. Sounds like you got something against Clean Sweets. It's just not the place it used to be, that's all. So you gonna answer my question? Which one? You only got about a thousand. Why you chose to come back home to Brampton. It's complicated. Adults always say that when they don't want to answer to a kid. A girl. Women. Women. Think you'll get her? It's not looking good. Well, did you tell her you want to eat her like a watermelon? I haven't. Maybe that's the issue. Well, I mean, it worked for me. Just saying. Yeah, we had a good run, but she wanted to hang out on the weekends. It's just like, "Weekends I'm busy." Saturdays are for the boys. Sundays, watching football. And then Mondays, you got Monday night football. Right, right. What about Tuesday or Wednesday or something? Totally free. And then Thursday night football. And Friday, she hates it when I black out. I can't believe there's not more prospects out there for you. Exactly. That's what I was saying. I'm a catch. If you want, I could ask Jane, you know, see if there's someone who can handle the schedule. Dr. Wachtell! - Hey! - Gavin, how are you? - Great. - How's the gum recession? Ah, still a little sensitive to cold water. Why don't you go ahead and set another appointment? We'll get you all fixed up. Yeah, I'll have my mom call. Oh, you got to meet my buddy, Dustin. Dustin, get over here. Hi. No, come over here. Meet Eddie. Fuck. Eddie, this is Dustin, my best friend. Dustin, this is Eddie, the greatest dentist in the Northeast. If you're looking for a guy, look no further. Nice to meet you. - Dustin, you look familiar. - Really? I don't... I don't know why. I don't... Oh, you guys are Eskimo brothers. We're what? You know, like, Eskimo brothers, share the same igloo. You banged the same chick. - Right. - Oh. Then that would make you Dustin Kimmel. Uh, Rachel told me that you guys used to date back in the day. You were high school sweethearts or each other's first loves or something like that. I love that stuff. That's so sweet. Yeah, yeah. Dust, this is the guy Rachel's dating. - Yeah, yeah, I... - Well, actually. As of yesterday, we're engaged. Oh, get the shit out of here, Doc! Oh, that's great news. Congrat... here, let me see the ring. - Uh, I don't... - Er, yeah, nope, yeah. You give the girl the ring. I... I knew... - Right, that's right. - I've never been engaged. Uh, almost once, but. Anyway, it was great to meet you. - Congratulations, man. - Thanks. Hey, listen, uh, you two should come to the engagement party. It's tomorrow night. It's 8:00 p.m. It's at Barbetto's. Oh, I am in. Eddie, I don't... it might be a little weird for you... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not at all. Rachel and I are... we're all... all across every... every cha... chapter. We... we're on the same page, is what I'm saying. We're in... friend zone... come... coming into a... into a... a platonic... just a simp... good, good... good place... we're in a great place. I'd love to come, and thank you for your invitation. Yeah, they're in a great spot. Okay, terrific! It's gonna be a full house then. - Hey. - Can't wait. Cannot wait to see you gents there. Should I give a speech or... - Uh, no, I'll give the speech. - Okay. - But you... you be there, buddy. - Bye. Fuck. Guy's something special, huh? I couldn't even speak. I know. That was embarrassing. Ma! Ma! What's... what's the matter? You... Hey, where's my suit? I need a suit. - What for? - Rachel's engagement party. Oh, you're going? - Oh, that's great. - Yeah. Oh, I'm so glad you guys are friends again. Hey, by the way, what do you want to do for your birthday tomorrow night? Want to invite some friends over? Ma, suit, where is it? Honey, I... I haven't bought you a suit since you were in high school. Where's the one you wore to Dad's funeral? I threw it out. Oh, it was gorgeous. Why would you do that? 'Cause it reminded me of Dad's funeral. Do you want to wear one of your dad's suits? I think there's one in there. Yeah, I saw it. Ma, it's so dated. Well, honey, I don't know. I don't know what to tell you. Mm-hmm. I like this. Oh, my goodness. Would it hurt to put a little effort in? Looks like you're going to your eighth-grade graduation. I really want to fit in here. - You do? - Yeah. Is this... is this open bar? Yeah, it's probably open bar. - Can you see Rachel anywhere? - No, she's taken. I'd save that for later. All right, see you at the end of the night. Dustin Kimmel, blast from the past. Robby, how are you, man? Hey, man. Good, good. The real estate gig's going well. I got my face on a couple bus stops around town. - That's great. - Yeah, yeah. You know, I pay for it. Gotta spend money to make money. - You know how it goes. - Right. Oh, I hear your mom sold the house, right? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Here, Take that, just in case it falls through, you never know. - "Keeping it real estate?" - Always, my man. Oh, you got to meet my wife, Vanessa. She's around here somewhere. Vanessa? What happened to Steph? We broke up four years ago, yeah. Vanessa and I got married last year. Right. So you guys have, like, a shotgun wedding or just something small? No, it was actually pretty big, yeah. Had it over at the yacht club. Oh. I sent you an invitation. It was never... never heard back. Well, I... I moved last year. You probably just had my wrong address. Right, yeah. I mean, I did send you a couple texts, emails. Right. When I'm mid-season, I kind of just shut everything out just so that I can focus and all. - Right. - Yeah, sorry about that. I get it. You're a busy guy. Chasing the dream. Totally. Yeah. Well, all right, uh, catch up later? - Yeah, man. - All right. - Great to see you. - Yeah, absolutely. Let me know if you want to hang out. Uh-huh. Don't be afraid to give that to your mom, okay? Okay. I mean, the older I get, the better it... I... I will talk to you in a second, okay? - Hey. - What are you doing here? Funny story, Eddie and I ran into each other yesterday, and, uh, he just invited me. He was probably just being polite. Well, this is me being polite back. Dustin, that was a courtesy invite. - You shouldn't be here. - Whoa. All I've done is just show up to a party I was invited to. - Can you leave? - You look really beautiful. Sorry, uh... Yeah, you're making this uncomfortable. Dustin, hey. I'm glad you could make it. Hey, of course. - Wouldn't miss this. - Good. Well, I'm glad that you guys are getting a chance to catch up. Hey, Rach, um, do you have your speech ready? Oh, yes. It's in my purse. Oh, good, the one that we proofread, right? The one that you proofread. Okay, I was... I just wanted to check. You are gonna be so awesome. Now if you'll excuse me just for a moment, uh, my father's friend is here. He happens to work in the mayor's office. I'm gonna try and, uh, land him as a client. You want to give me, like, two minutes, and then come over and help me butter him up? Sure. - All right. - Mm-hmm. Here's hoping I don't strike out. - See you. - See you. He keeps tapping me on the shoulder. - Yeah, he does that. - Can you get him to stop? I've tried. Struck out? You do look really beautiful. Sorry. Just saying. I'm good, thanks. Oh, yeah, no, these are for me. Wha... You okay? - Yes. - Ready? - Yes. - All right. Thank you, thank you, everyone, for... for coming. I, uh... I prepared a couple of words that I would just like to share. Um. The first day I met Rachel, I knew she was the one. Aww. She walked into my office, and she said she needed a root canal. And after she left, I needed a root canal... for my heart. Oh. I've been lucky enough to lead a great life, uh, an ice cream sundae of a life, if you would, and Rachel as my cherry on top has made me the luckiest man this world has ever known. That is why I can't wait for you to become Ms. Rachel Wachtell. I'm getting out of here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you. - Thank you for being here. - Thank you. Uh, dessert is coming out right now. Please enjoy, just not too much, or I'll see you in the office. Rachel? Yeah, coming. Listen. You remember this song? You wrote this right before we moved to Washington, right? Yeah, we were so happy. Before everything. Just you and me. You know, my first couple of dates with Eddie were fine. I mean, they were okay. He was kind and successful and handsome, and... people in town seemed to like him, and all of my girlfriends were getting married anyway, so I... I guess I figured I would just go with it and hope that it became something great... 'cause he was good. It is good. It's just... just good. You know? Yeah. Are you still an awful dancer? I am an incredible dancer, and you know that. I shouldn't. - Happy birthday, Dust. - Thanks. What's going on? Just cleaning out the house for Mom. You guys have got to be out of here in a couple of weeks. You should start packing up your stuff. And put it where? I don't have anywhere to move into. Well, it's called life. Figure it out. What's wrong, Dust? Nothing. What is it? Is she what brought you back? You think I came back to put up with your shit? Well, I'm glad you did. I mean, it might have been more peaceful without you here, but I missed the chaos. Me too. So what do I do, J? I mean, there's not much that you can do. Seems like it's up to her at this point. Wow, it's the hands-off approach. That's not exactly what I was expecting from you. There are some things in life that you can force. This ain't one of them. Yeah. Happy birthday. How have you been? Look at all these gray hairs coming in, here. - Yeah, coming in fast. - And here, here. - And elsewhere. - Oh. Have you thought about what you're gonna do yet? - About what? - About a job, a career. One step at a time. Where does he think you are right now? I told him I was staying at my mom's tonight. I am gonna tell him tomorrow. - Oh... oh! - Ma! Ma! - Hey, Judy. - Hi, Rachel. What a surprise. Um, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to barge in on you two. Uh, Dustin, I'm... I'm putting in a load of laundry. Do you have enough clean sheets? Yeah, Ma, great, whatever. - Okay, of course. Night-night. - Thanks. - Night-night. - Night, Judy. What about towels? You can never have enough clean towels. Ma, I... I use the same towel all week. Oh. - Please close the door. - Oh. - Please. - Oh okay, night-night. - Thank you. - Good night. It's just like high school. Everything's gonna be fine. I know. Hey. Hey, look at me. We're gonna be happy. Skip, what's up? Okay. Hey. Okay, so, uh, I am meeting up with Eddie later at his place, and I'm gonna tell him then. Okay, okay, good, good. You know, I'm really sorry if last night I didn't seem as assured as you were about everything, but you know, I woke up this morning, and I just... I feel good. I feel really, really good. Me too. Is everything all right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all good stuff. I got the call. - What call? - The call. Seattle's catcher got injured, and they want me to fly to LA, finish the series against the Angels as the second catcher. This is a good thing. Yes. Yes, it is. It's... it's great news. Uh, I am very proud of you. - Thank you. - Then what? Wh... what do you mean? Well, after the playoffs, does that mean that you're gonna be playing for Seattle next year or... I get the idea that this would be a one-series deal, and then... And then you'd be back to trying out next year? I... I don't know. I don't know what next year... No, I... I do, because you're incapable of just having a little taste, and you would keep chasing it, and then we're gonna be back where we were three years ago. I haven't... I haven't even made any decisions yet. We both know you have. Hey, hey. Good luck, Dustin. Thanks, Bart. All right, buddy, keep practicing. Will do. Come here. - It's good to see you. - Good to see you too. Oh, Lord, not this one. I called it! I told you! I told you, you... - Ohh... - We did it! - We did it, buddy! - We did do it. You and me... you need an assistant? - I'm your guy. - I thought you would be. - Hey, Jane. - Hey, you. Yeah, thanks, bud. Oh, get in there. Yes. So how'd she take it? - I'm sorry. - Yeah. Listen, you know what? You deserve this. I'm proud of you, kay? All right, give me a hug. Oh, thank you. Appreciate it. Dustin. - Oh, hey. - Hi. I'm Hal. Welcome. We're happy to have you here. - Thank you. - Let me grab this for you. - Oh, you didn't have to... - How was your flight in? Uh, great, thank you. Was the car service there on time? - Yeah, yeah, it was great. - We're using a new company, and want to make sure our players are happy with it. - Oh, oh... - Thank you very much. - Yeah, he was great, really. - Got you all checked in. In there, you're gonna find your scouting report on Anaheim, you room key, and your per diem for the night. 100? It's more than you're used to, huh? Yeah, just a little. Now, all the players are out to dinner. It's pretty late, so I would suggest you grab room service in your room or something to eat right there at the bar. Okay. Tomorrow morning there's a players breakfast in one of the conference rooms here at the hotel. All the information is in there. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Oh, uh, who's my roommate? Welcome to the show. Okay. No way. Oh... My man, can I get a club soda, please? Diego Alomar? Hey, man, Dustin Kimmel, catcher brought up from Tacoma. - Hey, man. - Hey, man. - Welcome. - Thank you. Yeah. It's your first time up? Yeah, first time. How long's it been? 12 years. Shit. That's long. Yeah. Yeah, felt like 20. Yeah, I know the feeling. It took me four, felt like a lifetime. - Any advice? - Enjoy the view. No matter how long you in the league, 20 years or for one series, you're always gonna be chasing another at bat. So take it in when you can. - Thanks, man. - Yeah. All right, rookie. Cheers. It's Diego Alomar. Hm. Hello? Hey, Dustin, it's Hal. Hey, I'm just, uh, coming down for the breakfast right now. Dustin, I'm gonna need you to pack your things. Sorry, I, uh... I don't f... I don't follow. The organization, they, uh... they brought up another catcher from Double-A. We'll have a car waiting for you to take you to the airport in 30. Be out front. Sorry it didn't work out this time. This time? When has it ever? Excuse you? Even my room's moved on. What do you want me to do, Dustin, not sell the house? Continue to grieve over your father? Would that make you feel better? - Everybody has to... - It's not that. It's just... I... I feel out of place here, and I'm not good enough to make it in the place I want to be. Who's the one who left and... and never bothered to keep in contact with anybody? I'm sorry if I'm trying to make something of myself. Do you know why you never made it out of Triple-A? Sure, let's hear it, Coach. Because all you cared about was the result. What's that supposed to mean? It was always about when you were gonna make it to the big leagues, when you were going to accomplish this, when you could afford that. You never appreciated the now, the... the process. You just raced through it fast as you could to get to where you wanted to be. I mean, you never appreciated the journey. That's all life is, Dustin. Because at the end of the day, we all end up in the same place. So if you never live in the present and take in the bad with the good, you never live a true life, one with purpose. Chasing a dream isn't a purpose. If I was so far off track, why didn't you say anything before? I wish I had. I should have. It was just... I knew how much it meant to you. You know, especially after... you know, after we... we lost your dad, you know? I just... I didn't want to get in your way. I mean, you know, you know how proud he was of you whether you made it or not, right? Right? Rachel. I heard it didn't work out. I'm sure that's tough. Man, nothing turned out well for you, did it? You came back to win the one who got away, and then you won the one who got away, and then you gambled the one who got away, who you now lost, all for the love that you've been chasing. Thanks for the summary. You won the one, and then you lost the one... Dustin Kimmel! Eddie. Hey, Eddie. We need to have a little chat. Really? What's... what about? Oh, you know what about. It was never about you, man. Okay, I'm gonna hit you. I... I don't want you to hit me. - Then stop me. - Is there a fist to stop? Nantucket, that felt good! Whoo! What the hell, man? I told you I was gonna hit you. He did say that. I was expecting, like, another warning or something. Okay, you know what? Shut up. You are nothing but a high school hero. Yeah? How about "you're welcome"? For what? At least now you know she's not the one for you. The one? Dustin, what are the odds of finding the one, huh? And that's not what it's about. It's about fighting to make it work with the one you want. That's it. I hear you, man. I just... I get the sense she didn't feel the same way. Maybe so. That wasn't for you to help her decide. Gavin, your mom called. I'll see you on Monday. What time? Nice swing. What happened to your face? I don't want to talk about it. You're looking pretty good in there. - I have a good coach. - Oh, yeah? What'd he teach you? Palm up, palm down, and don't go fishing. Smart guy, that coach. - Oh, he's all right. - Excuse me? What I want to learn is how to take a pitch. - How to take a pitch? - Yeah. How to lean into it if the team needs a guy on base. I know what it is. Keep swinging like this, you're not gonna need to learn that. Well, I'm trying to round out my game. All right. That's it. What are you, like, thinking about? There's nothing to think about. You just turn and lean. - Doesn't it hurt? - Yeah, at first. But eventually you get used to it. You harden, and it doesn't hurt anymore. Can I try? - No. - Come on. - Let me try. - Really? I'm tough. - Please? - Okay. Okay. Yeah! You good? Yeah, I'm okay. Oh, so that girl sent me a message on Instagram today. What... what? ♪ Playa! ♪ That's awesome. - Yeah. - What'd she say? So I posted a picture of this new band I found, and she said, "I love them!" And then she put a winky face emoji. You know, in my day you used to have to type a semicolon and then a half-parenthesis to wink at a girl. Sounds like a lot of work. It was. I think I like her. It's not too early to determine that? Well, when you know, you know, right? So you ready to talk about what happened to your face? I guess I never really knew. What? It's funny for you, Judy. You didn't have to have the photos. You were such a good sport. I had an oil stain on the front of my dress. I know. I know. The three of you out there changing a tire. - Heather wasn't. - No... she didn't... she sat in the car, you said, right? - Of course. - Well, she's a big help. She's still... Still not over that? What happened to your face? - Nothing, nothing, it's just... - That's not nothing. - Let me see. Let me see. - No, it's... Let me. Ow. Ow, ow. Come here. - I was just in the- - Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. Cage. I wasn't paying attention. What are you talking about? You've been in those cages your whole life. You never got hurt before. Here. I got it. I got it. I got it. Just chalk it up to a new experience. You said I needed more of those. - Ma, could you give us a second? - Sure. Hey, good night, honey. Nice to see you. You too, Judy. - Mm. I was off to bed anyway. - Okay. Hey, what do you want for breakfast? - Just... I'll make you anything. - Ma. I'm sorry. His fist looks a lot worse than my face. I told him not to look for you. Admit it, though, you're kind of glad he did. Yeah, now that I can see that you're alive, I'm not that upset. Honesty, there you go. That was never our problem. So what do you think was? - Timing. - No, no. If you really want something badly enough, you make the timing work. I'm sorry about what happened. No, I deserved it. I mean with Seattle. Right. I was right there. Thought I had it. I've been there. Am I a bad person? Why would you ask me that? I broke up your engagement to a decent guy... No, you didn't. That was my choice. You know, if a batter stands in front of the box, I signal the pitcher, throw a high fastball, back of the box. Breaking ball's the best call. If the batter typically strides off the plate, dropping curve ball's the best bet. You ask me anything outside that diamond... I'm sorry. You have so much love to give. And one day everything outside the diamond will become much more clear. You never should've had a timetable, and neither should I. When you're ready, you just... you know. Why'd you come here? Closure. - Hey. - Hey. I love you, Mom. I love you too. Oh, I know. Are you happy? Just moving in with Bart and everything? Yeah. Yeah, I am. Good. - Thank you. - For what? Putting up with me. Yeah, that's what I signed up for. Subtitles by explosiveskull
