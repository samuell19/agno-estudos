"This light between us I wanna know you" "Forget about the fuss. I'm one with you" "This light between us, I wanna know you" "Forget about the fuss" Hey wear your glasses Oprah! Mind where you're crossing Tracy Chapman. Walking around like a clown. These pedestrians are getting on my last nerves! I don't care if they're motorists, bicyclists or walkers. Learn to respect your elders on the road! I need you to calm down Lucie. Elle, please! With that big mouth of yours, no wonder you can't keep a good man. Oh really? Yeah. Well, excuse me Dr. Phil. I was unaware of that. Ok, Ok, but let me ask you this. What happened between you and Jamal? Uh.. Well... He could not stomach the fact that I am an opinionated and confident woman. Really? Opinionated or rude? I am Lucie. I say it as it is. Unapologetically. Ok. Alright. You'll never comprehend. You're right. You're ok? Yeah I'm ok. Just don't think too much. Everything's gonna be okay. Just don't worry. Think about me, you'll be just fine. That's the problem, I don't want to think about you. Hmmm, that hurts. Call me when you get there. Ok, I will. Hey, while you're there, find me a fine-looking, self-assured man. Did you hear me? Yes, everybody heard you! Hello Ms. Walters, how you doing? I'm well. How are you? I'm good. Please sign in. Yes ma'am. Is that everything? Yes ma'am. Down the hall please. Thank you. Have a good one. You too. Yeah, well, Elle is not here. So as soon as... Yeah... Well... It's not something I wanna be proud of... Yeah she's here. Let me call you back. Did you check your email this morning? No, what happened? It's not looking good. Alex Peters is already talking to another software company. Which one? We don't know but from what my source told me is that the company is charging him half of the price we are. And not only that they also letting him have some shares. It's not looking good, Elle. Listen, don't worry. I know what kind of guy Alex Peters is. No company can top ours and he knows it. I'll just shake him up a little bit at our next meeting. I know he'll come around. That's it? That's it. Don't worry. In the meantime find out which company he's been speaking with. All right, let's get started. What's on the table today? Alex Peters. Alright, let's get to work. What about Ursula Burns? I mean she's the first black female to become a CEO of a fortune 500 company. I mean... Why do people always like to mention color? How about praising Ursula for just being among the first female to be a CEO of a fortune 500 company? You mean color doesn't exist? You don't see color? I mean... What about just having a sister... What's wrong with having a sister praising another sister for representing the community? The more we keep on highlighting color, the more there will be tensions across races, whether we talk about color as an achievement or for segregation purposes. Ok, so let's say for example if we use your logic and the police is trying to identify a suspect and like you said you don't believe in color so would the police just say “okay we're looking for a male in his 30s about 200 pounds”? I mean you know that's... In that case it would be really hard to narrow down the pool. Guys, can we not talk about this right now, please? So would you rather us talk about relationships, Ms Iyanla Vanzant? Come on. I already have a drink. Everybody, this is my friend Luke. Luke, everyone. Hello ladies. Hi! How are you doing? How are you? I'm... I'm... I'm good. Good to see you. Thank you. Uh, you wanna chat a little bit? Uh, sure. I'll... I guess I'll be on my way. Guys excuse me. Thank you. - How are you? - I'm doing good. You? Doing good. It's good to see you. - So how did you know I'd be here? - I keep tabs on you. Wait, no, so how did you know I'd be here? I got my sources. Ok. Well, Lucie told me that you'd be here in DC meeting a client. Only Lucie would say that. - There's a problem? - No, I just wish she would have told me. What difference would it have made? So how long you're in town? As long as you want me to. So, how's work? How's your business going? It's doing good. There's got to be more to it than that. What do you wanna know? Anything. Well, business is doing good. We're growing. We got some new partners in DC and Alexandria. So we'll have a couple of meetings, papers to sign and close the deal. Well, that's good, right? Yeah. You don't sound excited. You know me, I don't get excited until a deal is closed. This is so embarrassing. I'm so sorry. I don't know what's going on with this phone. So sorry. It's okay, really. It's been doing this since I got in DC. When... when do you head back to California? Next week. And you? This weekend. So, how's everything? You know, everything's good. Yeah? You don't believe me? I do. Kinda doesn't sound like it. You think I'm trying to hide something? I don't know, you tell me. I haven't heard or seen you since the day you left the company. I feel like you've been avoiding me. I'm sorry. It's just been really busy. So that's the reason you have not returned my calls or text messages? I don't know. Tell me, Elle, is it wrong to be bold and express oneself? Luke, you know why I reacted the way that I did. I don't know. There's something that tells me that you feel something for me but you… you're scared of opening up to me. Look, I can spot a remarkable lady when I see one. And I'm a gentleman who knows how to cherish real diamonds. Please, grant me the honor of proving myself. - Luke, you don't understand - Then, help me understand I will not give up on you that easily, Elle. I think if we can offer more opportunities to our customers, the company can scale even higher but my boss is so hell-bent on keeping things the same no matter how many times I tell him to change the philosophy he keeps rejecting my ideas and we keep losing customers. I mean we haven't had any new ones lately. Can you believe that they keep dropping us in the middle of projects? I just want to convince the client that I'm meeting later this week, you know? Well, I have confidence you will. Thank you. Can you believe we've been using the same model for years? And our customers are no longer interested in what we have to offer. I know, customers are hard to please. Man, if we keep going like this, things are gonna get really tough. No clients, no money. Well, if things don't work out you can always come back and work for me. And your office is still the way you left it. So what are you doing on Wednesday? I have a meeting in the morning. And after that? I have an appointment. Will you be free at all? Uh... I don't think so. Why? I have a business meeting and I need your expertise. I'm not sure if I should do business with them or not. So here's the thing, my business partner had an emergency and he had to leave and I desperately need a second opinion. Plus, you're just the exquisite brain I need. I would love to help but... But you cannot. I'm so sorry. Please. Alright, I should be on my way. That's your car, right? Yes Alright. I'll see you. Alright. Listen, I'm not sure if I like the design anymore. We need to come up with something better. The deadline is too close. We can't make any more changes. We want perfection. Yes, I understand. But considering the time constraint, we can't Luke. All we want is the check. Stop worrying too much. I worry because I care about my clients I want them to be happy. Listen, make the change and get back to me. Alright, Mr. Perfect! Man, Luke, your DC office looks good on you, man. Lot of work, lot of work going on. Yeah, we'll definitely get it done. That noise, man! So annoying. This is way better than the market noise you had before. I know, right? Dude, I don't get it. Every time I travel, my devices always start acting funny. It's simple. It's time for a device funeral. Stop mocking my devices now. How's Elle? Did you meet her yesterday? Yeah, I did. So how did it go? I don't know. I seriously don't know. There's a wall I just can't seem to break. Either she's just not telling me something or maybe she just just likes keeping me in the dark. Just be patient, she'll come around. Trust me, it's been 2 years. 2 years?! Wow! I commend you, man. She's definitely got you under her spell! I know, right? For the fact that she never openly rejected me tells me that she has some feelings for me. And this keeps me going. Sometimes, I just really want to hold her in my arms and say "unleash all your emotions to me, Elle" Yeah, yeah you're right. But look, if she's the one man then you have to wait until she comes around. Maybe she's had some bad experiences in the past and she's just trying to study you. You know good things come to those who wait. On the other hand, maybe you should quit dreaming my dear Joseph. and see reality for what it really is and you need to move on to another woman Elle is a treasure and you don't find women like her everyday. Ok Romeo, I rest my case. Alright. Fixed! You serious? Yeah. It won't last long though. For the love of Elle, please get a new phone. Don't play with me, man. I don't get it. You've had this phone for ages, is it that excruciating to get a new and better phone? I don't know. I don't like giving up on things that easy You know it's like a marriage thing "for better and for worse" I can see that with Elle too. But look man, invest in a better phone that works. That's all. Well, if I do that then who I'm gonna bother again? Uh, not me. Anyway... You wanna get some drinks tonight? Nah, I'm actually meeting Elle tonight. It's not... It's not what you think. It's strictly business. Nothing wrong mixing business with pleasure. Whatever man, whatever! Alright man. Y'all have fun. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. See you later. Let me walk you out. Okay - Hold on. Let me grab my jacket - Perfect What? Do you know how this feels like? Good. That's how it feels like. Being here with you feels alright. Elle, lead me to your heart. I'm willing to do anything. I want to exit this shadow of ambiguity and dwell under your wonderful light. You know, many women come and go but you are one in a million. Knowing you has been the greatest gift of my life. I love you. Oh oh listen Luke I'm so sorry I have to take this call. It's an important client. I am so sorry. It's okay. - I'll meet Mr. Oswald and I'll see you back in the lobby? - Ok - Yes you go ahead. I'll meet you - Ok Alright Allo, Alex. Yes. Mr. Oswald. Mr. Poonen. - Nice to finally meet you - Nice to meet you as well Please. I appreciate you meeting me this evening. You're a hard man to meet, Mr. Poonen. Please, Luke should be fine. Luke. Yes. You know, "Busy" is my middle name. And you know how things work in our world. Yes. Well, I really appreciate you meeting me. It's a pleasure. - As you know Mr. Poonen, sorry, Luke. - Yes My business has not been doing well for the last several years and we are looking for a company to merge with. I don't want anyone coming in and buying up my life's work turning it into trash. I want to leave something behind for my kids, my grand kids. I want it left behind the way that I built it and run the way that I meant it. Do you understand that? I certainly do Mr. Oswald. Hey you, did you get my message? No, which one? Are you serious Lucie? I sent it to you this morning. I swear girl, I didn't get any text messages. Forget it. What was it about? No, no, just forget it. Listen, how things going there? Did you get a chance to go by the house? Yeah. Everything looks good. Ok. So, how's the search going? What search? To find me a fine looking man, remember? Oh that one, it's still going. Listen, it's either you come back here with my handsome man or you come back in the arms of Luke. What? How is he by the way? He's good. I'm actually here with him. I like the sound of that Ms. Juliet. No, no, listen, Ok? He only wanted me to come with him to meet a potential client. That's it. Wake up from your slumber, sleeping beauty! It's definitely a date. A guy who asked a woman to accompany him to a business meeting at night, it's called a date. I don't think I understand. I mean, how is it a date if we're talking business? Are you familiar with Ben & Ben Co.? Yes sir, I am. They were one of the mergers that I have been considering but honestly after meeting with them, I changed my mind. See... They want to break my company apart: peddle it off piece-by-piece to the highest bidder. I've run my business for 40 years. I know that we're not in the greatest shape but I also know that we are going to get through this if we partner with the right company. I know that you are a man of honor, value and integrity. Luke, that's why I want you. I want to partner with you. I know that if you were to merge with us, my business we'd be in good hands. I believe so as well Mr. Oswald. And I did have time to go over your file. And... it's just that I can't make a decision right now. You know, I have to talk to my board. I understand. I knew you wouldn't be able to make a decision tonight. You've gotta talk to your board. You've gotta decide if this is right for your company. And honestly with the shape that were in I would understand if you were to deny my request. But, to be honest I just wanted to meet you, have a conversation with you face to face. I'm glad we got to meet as well. Luke, I apologize, I don't mean to run but it's my grandson's birthday. - Oh, congratulations! - Thank you I'm already late. Luke, I very much appreciate taking the time to meet me. Thank you. And I hope you have, a great, great night. Enjoy your party. - It was a pleasure meeting you - Pleasure meeting you as well Thank you. Girl, Luke is a busy man. He's got no time to go to restaurants or do things regular people do. So when he takes you to a private meeting like the one he took you to that's a date for him. Uh... I guess so. I...I...I...I'll call you, ok? I... I'll call you. I gotta go. David! David! Nadyne told me you were here. Sorry for keeping you waiting. I had to take care of some important calls. You've been here long? I saw her. David, you're okay? I saw her. Who? What? When? Where? How? Last night. What happened? Nothing. What do you mean? We both were shocked when we saw each other. I couldn't speak. She said... She said she'd call me. Has she called yet? It feels surreal, you know? Before... Before I met her, I was content... content with who I've become. Not totally happy but content with the life that I now lead. Seeing her just brought back all those memories again. The time we spent apart didn't diminish... I hope she calls you. I... I... I... I'll call you, ok? I...I...I'll call you. I gotta go. Everything alright, Elle? I see... I... I...see what you're... what you're saying... however... Is everything alright, Elle? Hello? Elle? ...however, given all of the time that I had spent in the field and knowing what I do about it. I must say personally I would let the design stand. Now I only want what's best for your project and from all of the satisfied clients I have worked with in the past I have a very good feel for the market. So trust me when I say this is your best way moving forward. Given my extensive background, I truly believe that this design is your best way moving forward. Considering my extensive background, I truly believe that this design perfectly suits all of your needs. Allo? Yes. They're there already? Okay, okay. Just keep them entertained. Ok, I'll be there in 20 minutes. Thanks. I have another meeting to attend.I have to go. But we're not finished yet. From what I've heard, this is not for us. You don't understand our company. I don't understand? What do you mean? I'll be going with a different company. But you're making a terrible mistake. Have a good day Elle! So, that was quick. How did it go? Elle? Yes? How did it go? He's going with a different company. You're playing, right? You're serious? Why? You know how it goes. But you assured us you were gonna handle Alex. Oh I cannot believe this. Did we really lose him? What part of "he's going with a different company" did you not understand? You know... I...I'm...I'm sorry. What's going on Elle? I...I've just got a lot on my mind. You know sometimes it's really hard to decipher you. Excuse me? Yes. You are a smart woman who is brilliant in what she does for a living but sometimes it just seems to be this other side of you that keeps holding you back. And how would you know that? Because your smile doesn't reach your ears. You seem to wander every now and then. I thought you were gonna stand me up How you been? I'm good. You? I'm still living. I can't believe you here. You look so different. Really? What's changed? Your hair. You wear it nice and curly. You got tired of being straight? Is it bad? It's not bad at all. You look amazing. Thank you. This is weird. What's weird? I mean bumping into you last night and now sitting here with you. It's been so long I haven't seen you. Where have you been? I came looking for you. I've been living in California for the past 5 years. Wow! That's pretty far! Yeah, I had to leave this place and forget everything. So, how long you've been in DC? 3 days now. Is this the first time you've been here since... Yes... Yeah. I guess I would have never known if we hadn't bumped into each other the other day. I... I was... I was thinking about it and I... - I was... - It's ok, I understand. I'm sorry, I'm just trying to find things to talk about. Please, you don't have to apologize for nothing. I just got so many questions I don't know where to begin. Please, let's not go there, ok? It's dangerous territory. Are you seeing someone? You're nervous. You always do that with your hands when you're nervous. The place looks different from what I remember. Yeah, new owner. Suresh moved back to India. "...Rioting and looting erupted in Montgomery Alabama on Tuesday as" "protests over the killing of a black teenager by a police officer" "Crowds broke windows of cars and stores in this US city following a day of" "demonstrations over the death of John Cooper an unarmed 18 years old shot dead" "on Monday by a police officer. About 150 officers in riot gear from Montgomery" "County along with k9 units were sent to the area. There was no immediate report" "of any injuries. Cooper was shot on his way to school..." Should we order now? Yeah. Good evening, my name is Dominic. What can I? Is everything okay? Is he okay? I don't know. I think everything is okay. I'm so sorry about that. He's not feeling well. My name is Sarah and I will be your waitress tonight. What can I get for you? I'll have the Chicken Biryani and she's gonna have the Chili Chicken with Samosa. Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. That's what I'll have. Ok, and what can I get for you to drink? Water no ice, please. Water no ice as well. Ok. It's just gonna be a few minutes. Thank you. I'm so sorry, I completely forgot. No, no, no it's okay. I just can't believe that you remember my favorite dish. I remember everything about you. I have a confession to make. Ok. Now, I've never told you this before but remember the last day of school when I was late to pick you up because... because you had to take your mom to the hospital. Well, that's not quite true. It wasn't? No. Remember Walnut Race? Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa! David you promised. I know I did but I had this big argument with the boys. Mike just kept harassing me about doing this race and just kept going back and forth and I didn't wanna look like a wimp in front of the other guys. Are you serious? You what? Yeah, that's how I crashed the car. Wait David, I loved that car. I know you did. Ok, ok. So how did you get back to school? Things that Mike put us through. - Ok, so let me explain - Uh-huh So after we got done with the argument over the car, the fellows and I knew Mike's uncle's friend So we're gonna go down to his bar and get a ride but it was five miles away. Ok, wait so you guys walked five miles? Why didn't you catch a cab or something? - Let me explain - Uh-huh We go to this bar, Michael's uncle's friend, and we're sweating, we're tired, we're thirsty. And unfortunately, his uncle's friend wasn't there. Ok, what happened? So there was one guy there who was willing to give us a ride... ...under one condition. Did I mention that it was a gay bar? It was, it was a gay bar? - My God - Really? - Yes - Really? - You just gonna laugh - It just got good I was angry and now I'm excited. So come on and tell me what happened at the gay bar. - So he was willing to give us a ride - Right, right But he wanted us to dance for him. You had to dance? What kind of dancing? You had to strip for him It was a gay strip club, wasn't it? I know it was. - I could just imagine you - Really? They probably give you a costume and everything. David you had to dance at a gay bar 'cause you had to 'cause you got back to me. What kind of dance did you do? Tell me, tell me 'cause... I can see you do the Macarena. - Ok, ok wait - That would be the best - Really? - Yes! Could you... I can imagine you doing the Macarena in some little shorts for a gay bar There'd be men screaming. I can see. This is great. Oh my gosh. Did somebody take pictures? Please tell me. Oh man! I wish I was there. I miss this. I miss our talks, your smile, our jokes. I miss the time that we spent together. David. I can't pretend like I don't miss this and have a smile on my face. David. I can't act like I don't miss you being here. How was everything? It was good. Thank you. Would you like anything else? No. - Dessert? - No, thank you. Alright. And I'll be right back with your check. Alright. I think she was looking at me as if I was dessert. Hmm... She was looking at me as if I was dessert. You okay? Um... I need to go to the ladies' room. Alright. I'll be back. David! Mitch, good seeing you man. It's been a long time. I know. Man, you put on a little weight, ain't you? Hey man, I can't complain. It's all that Indian food I've been eating. Yeah, I can see that. How's your wife? She's good. She's probably back there in the kitchen bossing people around. You know how she is. Man, I got to tell you this again: I'm so proud of you. You're a black man married to an Indian woman, hiring people of all different backgrounds and ethnicities to work in harmony and unity showing that race ain't nothing but a color. You know it's all because I had a dream that "one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of this creed" "we hold these truths self evident that all men are created equal" That's right, man. That's right. I'm so proud of you. Hey man, I heard you opened a new restaurant in Chantilly. I am. Wow, man! Business must be doing good. How many restaurants you got now? Three now. Dude, I'm so proud of you man. That's amazing. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hard work pays off, you know. I got a grand opening next month, you should come. We’ll serve free food from 1:00 to 3:00 pm Huh, for sure I'll be there. Thank you, thank you. You free this week-end? Yeah We should come out, we should catch up. I gotta take this call though. - Yeah man for sure - Alright, man. I'll talk to you later, man. Alright, man. - That's right - See you later Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. There's a place I wanna show you. Really? It's a surprise. Ok. You good? I'm good. I'm good. Oh snap! I think I left my beanie back at the restaurant. Do you wanna go back and get it? Nah, I just give Mitch a call. Yeah. Hey Mitch, what's up man? I think I left my beanie back at your restaurant. You think you hold it for me till tomorrow? Really? I tell you what? I text you the address right now. Thanks man. I appreciate it, talk to you later. You still sing? No. What happened? I don't know. I just... I don't like it anymore. You were so good at it. You should get back to it. Nah. Plus, I don't know... I really don't miss it, you know. Thank you. Yes, you do. And how would you know that? 'cause I know you. I...I don't... I don't like the way this conversation is going. Remind me, where did we go wrong again? Ok, we started to drift apart and we didn't have much time for each other. We started acting differently towards each other and David we try to make it work but nothing changed. That is so untrue. Are you being factual right now? Ok, when I started working... ...long hours. And I supported you Yeah because you liked it. I liked you working long hours? Yes! Me not being around because that meant that you didn't have to be around and that way everything was even and it wouldn't be your fault. Wait, none of it was my fault? Right. Like nothing... Like us not having time for each other or not talking... David, why are we even talking about this? It doesn't even matter anymore. It doesn't even matter? No. It doesn't even matter? David. You know how many sleepless nights I had? Wondering where you were, what was going on with you? And neither you working long hours or me working had anything to do with you not being here. When I had those sleepless nights, all I could think about was you. David, come on. Think about your love, think about us. And when you weren't here, all I could think about is how good we were together. David, come on. All I know is that I was on the phone crossing the street. That's it. What are you talking about? You were jaywalking ma'am. J-walking, K-walking, C-walking. What? Am I a danger to society now? Hey, you need to shut up now! What you gonna do? Shoot me? Ok, shoot! Ma'am! What'd I do wrong? Disobeying a law enforcement officer! Listen, I got everything on my phone so if you dare put your hands on me… Put your phone down! You're about to go to jail. I got everything on my phone - so if you dare put your hands on me - Yeah, you're about to go to jail You gonna regret this. Yeah, you're lucky Whatever! Come on. I recognize those singers from back there. From where? I... I don't quite remember. Don't worry, it'll come back to you. So, you're into software design? Yeah, I work for a software company in California. You like your new workplace? It's... it's okay, you know. It pays the bills. What about you? Are you still working for the government? No. No? What happened? You happened. I just couldn't go on when you left. I couldn't even imagine doing that with you not being here. I couldn't even think straight while you weren't there. So I just resigned and I mean I was a wreck all the time and when you're a wreck you know how that goes. What… what are you doing now? I'm a business consultant. Do you like it? It's ok. I'm not complaining but um... it pays the bills. Michelle. They finally did it? Yeah, they did. It took a heck of a time getting it done too. Well, when did they finish it? Just last year. Really? It's...beautiful. You gonna get that? It's been ringing for the last hour. Yeah, I'll call him back later. Him? It's not what you think. I didn't say anything. You didn't have to. You remember this here? You remember what happened last time, right? No, we're not doing that again. But I said I'd give you a rematch. I don't want... No, no, we're not doing that again. No. You know what this means, right? Listen, we cannot do this, ok? We're not doing that because I have on heels and it won't be fair. So you're chickening out on me? No, I'm not chickening out on you. I have on heels. How is that fair if I'm running and I have on heels? Look, I tell you what, just race me to the light. Heels. Heels. Look, we both can race barefooted then. Bare... Ok...Yeah... And what if I step on something crazy? Well look, I can check and make sure that it's clear and then we aight, ok? - Ok. - Ok, hold on. Aha! All clear! It's clear? It is clear. We're really taking our shoes off? Yeah, we just said we gonna run barefooted. Don't you slow down. Don't chicken out on me yet. Let me help you with that. No, no, no. I got it. I got it. I don't want your stinky help. Ok, alright. Imma beat you like I always do. If you ever beat me that's because I let you win. You didn't...No you didn't. You have never let me win my man. - You can't hurry up. It's gonna... - It's ok. Ok, ok. I got my shoes off. Alright. You good? Let me stretch out a little 'cause you don't wanna see this. Here we go again. Here we go again. You're ready? Alright, come on. You're ready. Come on, let's get up to the line. Come on. Get up to the line? Alright, you're ready? - David? - You're ready? We're doing all of that? You know, I used to run track, right? Come on, let's go. You ready to lose? Are you ready to lose? You cheater. Alright, that's fine. I'm coming. I can beat you any time, any place. Imma run like an old lady. I got... ouch... David, you said you got everything. Wo, wo, wait Michelle. Wait, wait, Michelle. - There was a glass down here or something - Let me see. Hold on, let me see... Nothing. Bye. That's cute. - Isn't it? - Really cute. I beat you. That's cute. That's really cute. It is cute, isn't it? I let you win. You...You let me win? No. I won fair and square my man. I let you win. You did not let me win. Don't take my win away from me. Hold on but you cheated. No, I didn't. You cheated first. How did I cheat? You made me believe that there was something down there and then you ran. That's not my fault that you started looking like there was something there. Are you kidding me? That is the perfect definition of cheating. Ok that's alright. I tell you what. What? I let you win this time but I'll beat you next time. Really? Ok I don't know if there'll be a next time. We can go get a cab. Alright. Let's go. You still cheated. I did not cheat. - You cheated - You still cheated. I don't care, you still cheated. - No, you just mad because I beat you - What you talking about? And I beat you all the time. - How you gonna beat me? - Are you kidding me? Ouh man, I tell you, it's always good beating you in a race again. You taking a little time? I can't get my feet in there. You need help with that? I think I got it. You sure? Yeah. You ok? David Michelle! You're ok? Michelle! I got you. Don't you worry. I got you. How you're feeling? I'm...I'm okay. I'm okay. When was the last time you fainted? It's been about a month. I thought they were gone. You haven't changed anything. I wanted to keep it intact. Are you ok? David, why did you bring here? What do you mean? I mean this place. Why did you bring me here? We used to live here, remember? Why didn't you boldly tell me you wanted to leave instead of leaving me a note? Because I wanted to forget you. Did you succeed? Do you know how many times I wanted to hear from you? To know how you were doing? To be able to keep in touch? But I couldn't because you changed your number. Ok, can we not talk about this right now? You owe it to me Michelle. This is the first time I've been able to talk to you since he died. I gotta know. Was it me? Because I know it had nothing to do with my working. I just had to know. I never blamed you for any of this. Ok look, just drop it David, ok? I don't wanna talk about it. I mean, what's the point? He's no more and we both moved on. He's no more, huh? Is that it? Is that why you got rid of any evidence of him? What? You got rid of any evidence that he existed. You took his photos off the fridge. You emptied out his room. You cleaned out his closet after a week he was gone. And then, you got rid of me because I was the last thing that reminded you of him. I was the last one, right? Answer me! Yes. You were the last reminder. And then you left without saying nothing. Oh I'm sorry, you left me a note that said "Please, don't come looking for me" David, it wasn't like that. It wasn't like that? No! Michelle you packed your belongings and couldn't face me before leaving. You changed your number so I couldn't even reach you. How could you be so selfish? You're my wife and you took me out of your life. Did I deserve that treatment? I never blamed you. I always loved you. I took time off so we could heal. I even went to support groups to help us get better because when you marry someone you become one with that person through the highs and the lows. I don't know why God took our son. We had him for seven years. I know he's in a better place. But you know what was worse than losing our son? It was losing you. And what hurt more than losing you was knowing that you didn't fight to save us. Wait a minute. You're not going anywhere. We're not through talking. What do you want from me, David? Huh? I'm the reason he's dead. Is that what you want to talk about? I have that on my conscience every single day. Every day. I carried him for 9 months, ok? I gave him life. I brought him into this world and I'm the same one that took him out. Not you, ME. I can't... I can't even look at myself in the mirror. I can't even forgive myself. I mean...God knows, He's not gonna forgive me for that... I just wish I would have stopped at that light, you know? If I had...If I had stopped at that light, he would still be with us. He would. Look, look... I never got rid of him, ok? I never got rid of him. It... it's just... I couldn't look at you in the face. I couldn't look at you in the eye because everything about you reminded me of him. Your smile and your face. One minute, everything was perfect and the next minute, it just vanished. It disappeared. I was in such a rush to get home to you. I was. No. Stop. I was in such a rush to get home to you and wanted to tell you the good news. And I saw the light and I thought I could make it. I tell you I did. I thought I could make it. It was still yellow and I was like "we can make it baby" So, when I lost him, I wanted to disappear, and to lose everything: all the memories of him and of you Because it hurts. It hurts. It hurts. And... And coming home to you every day hurt. So I pushed you away. And... and I didn't let you in and I rejected you because I wanted you to hate me. Because I didn't deserve your love, ok? I'm the reason that he's not here with us, ok? And I'm sorry. I am. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, David. David, what's up man? Hey man, what's up? Wo, wo, wo! Is this a good time? Hey man, I brought this back for you. Thank you. Man, you didn't have to drive all the way down here. Please come in. Man, it's cool I brought Dominique. He lives 2 miles from you. Plus, he wanted to apologize for the way he acted at the restaurant. No need to apologize. We all have bad days sometime. Yeah, that's true. It was uh... It was uh...unprofessional how I acted at the restaurant. Hey man, don't worry about it. Michelle here's Mitch. Mitch, this is Michelle. How you doing? He owns the restaurant where we had dinner at. And that's Dominic. He works for Mitch. She's just not answering my calls. She... Hey, everybody, this is my friend Luke. Luke, this is Mitch, Dominic. This is Michelle. Come on have a seat. This is our time to leave. Come on man, y'all just got here. Let me fix you something to drink. Hey man, I don't have your favorite. Hope this will do. You know that's merely water. You don't have to gulp it down like that. The way you're gulping down that water it's a bit overreacting. Even the water will be embarrassed. How's Elle? I thought she was coming with you. I...I don't know. Did you have a fight? No. So what happened? Are you ok? You look half-dead. I'm fine. Uh... So that's uh...the lady in the living room is your wife? Yeah... Yeah man. Your wife, right? Yes. What the heck is wrong with you? So, how do you know David? I'm...We're married. Oh wow, how long you've been married? We got married right after college. Ok, young love! Definitely like that. You go through the ups, trials and tribulations. You know, you experience it all. Me and my wife have been married 7 years. We got two kids. That's...that's great. Yeah and the best part about it is those kids. I was scared at first 'cause I didn't know how I'd be as a father but at the end of the day that's what I look forward to - those kids. David seldom talks about you and everything. You don't come to the restaurant. He's always there alone. You don't like my restaurant? I'm sorry. I don't live in the area. Oh, this is a long-distance relationship. It's a bit complicated. I understand. I'm so overjoyed and so overwhelmed to have my wife back here today. It brought back so many memories just having her right here. You know, the time apart didn't quench none of the feelings I have for her. You know what? I can see that with Elle too. I don't want you to relent. She'll come around soon trust me. I'm sure Elle is the one for you. Keep your love burning. She'll eventually realize that you're the one for her. I can't wait. I look forward to it - me, my wife, you, and Elle. Luke! Luke! Yeah? Where did you go? Are you ok? I'm fine. You know, I have a great feeling about you both. She's just have to come around man. Trust me. I told you man like I said I have a real good feeling about you both. You just can't relent. I'm telling you man, she's gonna come back. She's gonna come around. Stick in there man. It's gonna be ok. Sorry guys, I don't have much. I hope this would do. It's cool man, it's always good to eat light at night. Mitch, the way you've been stretching lately you'll be paying homage to eat on a regular basis at night. Come on, man. You just gonna embarrass me in front of your wife like that. I don't want her to think that I'm glutton. Oops I'm sorry, man. Dang! Besides, I was telling your wife how beautiful marriage was and that you know... Luke, you got a wife? Girlfriend? Well, kinda sorta. She's just taking a little slowly. Ah those are the ones to fight for. Nobody wants an easy woman. I don't know how to say this. Hey Dom, just get it out man. That's okay. Nowadays, people don't even apologize anymore. Please! Let me say this. I come from a family of cops. Grandpa was on the force as well as my dad, uncles, brothers. So it was obvious I'd become one. I didn't want to be the black sheep so I joined the force when I was 18 and I came to love it... ...until one day. Ready for another run? So wrong what we're doing dude. Don't you like the bonus that we get? Yeah man but... No buts! Listen, you need the extra money. You have hospital bills to pay. And your miserable paycheck isn't gonna cut it. Your mom's dying. People aren't gonna keep helping you pay those bills. I certainly won't either. What ever happened to getting bonuses the right way? How this is not the right way? Remember, we got the department support on this. They'll protect us, they always do. Right now, we're just harassing people that have done nothing wrong. Just zip it! You're more than welcome to go home because I don't got time to babysit sissies. These people, they're the plague of this great nation. They're lazy, violent and drug-addicted. The men, they're taking our women and I along with the others would do whatever it takes to pass the message along. And we no longer want them here. How about that car? how about that car? Fine. How about that one? What are you doing? It's a woman and she has a kid. Shut up, woman! You're out of your mind, you know that? Yes? Ma'am, keep your hands in plain sight. I need to see your license and registration. I need to reach into my glove compartment to get my registration. Do it slowly. Stay in the vehicle, please. Ma'am, step out of the vehicle, please. Why? Ma'am, step out of the vehicle, please. But why? Ma'am, step out of the vehicle, please. Ma'am, step out of the vehicle, please. Ma'am, this is your last command. I will not repeat myself. Step out of the vehicle. I haven't been drinking if that's what you think. Mommy! It's ok, son. Well, we shouldn't have a problem. Stand on your right foot. Touch your nose with the index finger of your left hand. Mommy! Boy, go back inside! Leave her alone. She's done nothing. Baby, listen, go back and get in the car, ok? The two of you, turn around, put your hands on your head, interlock your fingers Leave him alone. It's just a little boy. Shut up! Wait a minute. Shut up! Put your hands on your head, interlock your fingers. Cuff him! No, no. Wait a minute. Listen, he's just little a boy. Ok, listen, you guys are overreacting, ok? Now, I know I ran the red light but I was just trying to get home. What's the big deal? Are you still barking? Pat him down. Baby, listen, it'll all be over soon, ok? I promise. You must be feeling proud of yourself preying on innocent people. I mean, what do you think a 7-year-old little boy has on him? A gun? Well, here's my question of the day: what are you people still doing here? Ok listen, I was coming home from a soccer game, my son's soccer game. And we were just trying to get home, ok? Now, I know I ran the red light but I had not been drinking. So if you would just give me my ticket we will be on our way. Obviously, you're too much of a monkey to understand my question. I said: what are you PEOPLE still doing in our country? We don't want you here anymore. We brought you here as slaves to slog but now we no longer need you. Go back to your filthy continent. For decades, we've done everything we can to make you understand we no longer want you here but your kind is too daft to get it. You robbed us of our identity of self. You... You robbed us of our name, language, religion, our culture. You made sure we disassociated from the motherland. Because of what you did to us and what you've robbed us from, our identity has been erased. We won't go back until you pay us back. So no we won't go back. We built this country. Now, you can do whatever you want to do to us but you will never defeat us. We will always rise up and defend ourselves. You talk all you want, do all you want... ...but at the end of the day it is your species we're wiping out slowly from American history. Black will crack. Get off of me! No! Mommy! You shot my baby. No... no, baby. Call 9-1-1 Baby, it's ok. It's gonna be, ok? I'm so sorry. Just stay with me, ok? Please. Please, stay with me. That night has haunted me ever since. I had to leave the force because I just couldn't live with myself. I didn't mean to shoot your son. I was reaching for the Taser. I know it doesn't make any difference but my intention was not to kill anybody that day. I just wanted them to show fear. When I saw you guys earlier at the restaurant, I just had to do something. I'm sorry for what I caused you and your family. I'm... All these years, I thought it was my fault. I thought it was because I ran that red light that you stopped me but you would have stopped us anyway. This was planned. Me and my son were targeted. David! David! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Get him out of here! Get him out of here! Get outta here! I'm sorry. Get out of here! Get him out of here!
