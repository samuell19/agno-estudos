AND, UH... STARTED TO GET CRAMPS. AND WE'RE IN THIS PARK WHERE THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN GO IS ONE OF THOSE PUBLIC RESTROOMS. I MEAN, WHAT A MESS. THERE'S NO TOILET PAPER, NO TOILET SEATS, I MEAN-- SO I GO INTO THE ONLY STALL THAT HAS A DOOR ON IT, AND, UM... UM, WELL, LET'S NOT GO INTO DETAILS, BUT LET'S JUST SAY THAT EVERYTHING THAT WAS INSIDE ME IS NOW...IN THE TOILET. AND, UM... I'M SITTING THERE STARING AT IT, MY PANTS AROUND MY ANKLES, AND, UM, UH... THIS WAD OF KLEENEX BETWEEN MY LEGS. AND ANYWAY, I HEAR THIS LITTLE RAP ON THE DOOR, AND THIS LITTLE VOICE SAYS, "AUNT RACHEL, AUNT RACHEL, I GOTTA PEE." AND I SAY, "HONEY, I'M REALLY SORRY, BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TO ONE OF THE OTHER TOILETS." AND SHE SAYS, "I CAN'T! THEY DON'T HAVE ANY DOORS! SOMEONE MIGHT SEE MY VIRGINIA." ( laughs ) OH.... OH... KIDS. THEY ARE SOMETHIN'. SO, WHICH ONE OF YOU IS THE ONE THAT CAN'T HAVE THE BABY? WOW. GEE, AL, YOU'RE GETTING KIND OF PERSONAL. WELL, GEE, RICHARD, YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT US-- ONLY FAIR WE KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS WITH Y'ALL. I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT... BUT THAT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING I'M GOING TO DISCUSS. IS SHE THE ONE THAT CAN'T REPRODUCE? NO. LORD... WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK IT'S A PLUS. YEAH. AND HOW IS THAT? WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE ALL I HAVE TO DO IS JUST LOOK AT MY WIFE, AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, SHE'S BIG AS A HOUSE. BUT YOU... CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH YOUR WIFE, ANY TIME, AND NEVER EVEN THINK TWICE ABOUT IT? OH, MAN, PERSONALLY, I THINK YOU'RE LUCKY. WELL, THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT. YEAH. YEAH. AND SHE IS A GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN, YOUR WIFE. YEAH? YES, SHE IS. YEAH. I MEAN, I'M NOT SAYING I WISH I'D NEVER GOTTEN WANDA PREGNANT. I MEAN, I LOVE MY KIDS. A PAIN THE NECK SOMETIMES, BUT THEY'RE MY HEART. AND, UM... NOW THIS ONE YOU'RE GETTIN'... I HOPE YOU'LL BE GOOD TO HER, GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS-- HEY. HEY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. I'M GONNA SPOIL HER ROTTEN. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WHEN SHE GETS OLDER, GOTTA KEEP AN EYE ON HER. PATRICIA, WELL, SHE'S ALREADY DRAWING INTEREST, YOU KNOW?, AND I TOLD HER, "ANY GUY EVEN LOOK AT YOU THE WRONG WAY, I'M GONNA KICK HIS BUTT INTO THE NEXT COUNTY." BELIEVE ME, I WON'T LET HER OUT OF MY SIGHT. I KNOW SHE'LL HATE ME FOR IT-- HEY, THAT DON'T MATTER. YOU GOT TO DO IT. DON'T GIVE IN. ABSOLUTELY NOT. I DON'T CARE IF SHE GETS MAD AT ME. SHE'LL THANK ME FOR IT LATER ON. THAT'S RIGHT. EXCUSE ME.

AND WHETHER THAT'S TRUE OR NOT IS NOT THE POINT. YOU'RE THE ONE KEEPS OFFERING TO PAY FOR THINGS. THE POINT IS, WE'RE STARTING TO FEEL USED. I LOVE THIS BABY. THIS BABY MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME. AND I DON'T LIKE TO THINK THAT SHE'S BEING USED AS A BARGAINING TOOL. OH, YOU KISS MY ASS! DON'T TELL ME YOU LOVE THIS BABY. YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW THIS BABY UNTIL I GIVER HER TO YOU.

( monitor beating ) WHAT'S THAT NOISE? IT'S THE BABY'S HEARTBEAT, HON. I CAN'T LISTEN TO IT ANYMORE, IT'S MAKING ME NUTS. COULDN'T YOU TURN IT DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT?
