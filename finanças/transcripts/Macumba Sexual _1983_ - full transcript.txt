I fell asleep typing. This novel is going to be a real pain. - I'm afraid. - Because it's a pain? Don't be silly. I had that horrible nightmare again. Again? It was in the desert. She was there. It's always the same woman. A strange woman. Her name is Tara. She's dark skinned and very beautiful. She carries two beasts with her. A man and a woman. She lets them loose and they throw themselves upon me. She laughs. And suddenly she's dead... with a strange animal upon her. If I was a sex therapist, I'd say you're sexually frustrated. I need to up my dosage of vitamins. Don't make fun of me. - I could ask a friend to give me a hand. - Don't be silly! - You know what? - What? - I'm gonna be on vacation forever. - Me too! Miss Alice Brooks, please answer the phone. - Who could that be? - My boss. HAPPY BAY - It's for you, miss. Long-distance. - Thanks. - Yes? - Mortimer speaking. Hi. How are you? Sorry to bother you, but we've got a rush job. But I'm on vacation. Princess Obongo wants to buy one of our houses in Atlantic City. She's staying on an island very close to you. Take a boat and go to the only hotel in town. The princess will send for you. Okay. Make the deal and I'll give you a nice bonus. Okay, all right. Bye. Alice! Alice! Tara! Tara? Tara, Tara, Tara. Tara! Tara? Tara, Tara! Alice! Tara. Alice! Alice! Alice! Alice! Alice! Alice! Alice! Excuse me, kids. Do you know where the hotel is? - On the other side. - That way? - On the sand dunes. - Back there? Tweet, tweet! Good morning, sir. My name is Alice Brooks, and I'm here on behalf of Nelson & Son Real Estate. It's an American company. They asked me to come here to set up an appointment. My name is Meme. I'm Alice. Alice? I read a story about someone called Alice. Is it you? - What do you think? - What do [ think? I think you're a fucking fake. I believe they reserved a room for me. A room? Yes, I think they made a reservation. Did a princess called Tara Obongo call you? The princess! Princess Tara Obongo can't call anyone anymore. She died a long time ago. - But that can't be. She's alive. - No, sirree. I'm sure of it. They called from far away. From the US. You want to go up to your room? Yes. I reserved the nicest bedroom for you. It's got a balcony, ocean views— Everything you deserve. It's on the first floor. Come on, let's go. You like my little critters, huh? They're my best buddies. What are you doing here? Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. I assure you I won't hurt you. You're... simply gorgeous, and a slut. Like all Western women. Don't go to that house. You will lose all your beauty there... and that whorish body. You could die there. You could die! She is evil! Whoever goes there, doesn't come back. Or her magic... will drive him crazy. Miss Alice? Some men have come to pick you up. They're waiting for you downstairs. Good morning, Miss Alice. This note is for you. My servants will go with you. I'm waiting for you. Tara. - Great. Thanks. - Please, the first one. Alice! Alice! Alice! Alice! Anybody here? Anybody? Anybody here? - Welcome. - Good morning. I hope so. My name is Alice Brooks. I'm Princess Obongo. Do you want to sit down, Alice? Yes, thank you. - Did you have a nice trip? - A little unusual, I have to say. First, that boat. It looked straight out of an old tale. But it was fun. I've never traveled on camel before. I must smell a bit strange now. Can I take a bath, please? These are my slaves. Poppy... and Tulip. They will take you to your room. I'll expect you in an hour. All right? Very well. You've got a beautiful property. - Have you lived here for a long time? - Yes. Along time. More than you can imagine. The house in Atlantic City is not as lavish, of course. - I imagine. But it doesn't matter. - It's very well built, that's for sure. It's ultramodern and it has a pool. Don't waste time talking about that house. It doesn't interest me in the least. But my boss told me that you wanted to buy one of our houses in Atlantic City. - Is that true? - You haven't understood me, Alice. Of course I'll buy the house, even though I'm not interested in it, nor will I ever see it. - Why do you want to buy it? - So you can impress your boss. - But it's very expensive. - It has allowed me to meet you. Why? Why did you want to meet me? You will know very soon. I made it myself. May your dreams come true. It's wonderful. This place is so quiet and relaxing. Time passes slowly here. Stay a couple of days and you'll see for yourself. I wish I could. I don't know what's wrong with me. What are you doing? - Have you been here long? - Awhile. I didn't want to wake you up. Are you still thinking about your strange trip to the princess's island? You don't believe my little adventure. But if that man from the hotel hadn't found me, you never would have seen me again. It's funny. I haven't had another nightmare since that day. You're Princess Obongo. What do you want from me? You shouldn't have heeded my call. You're under my power now. But who are you really? I'm not real. I'm an unspeakable dream. I'm everything that's forbidden, that's shameful, a black woman with an undefined sexuality, shameless and irresistible. “Tara, Tara, Tara, Tara. ”” - What's wrong? - Please help me again, I beg you. I'm looking for my husband. He's tall, French. Do you think he's with the princess? The princess? She doesn't exist— doesn't exist, no. But your husband must be with her. He's gone for good. What do you mean for good? She's the mirror of evil. And of death. Death. Death. Tara. I'm sorry, Lara. Princess Obongo. Princess Obongo! You're the new Princess Obongo. With this sacred intercourse I transfer all my magic over to you, through the holy ivory, damned and blessed by our great father, Macumba. Alice! Alice! Beautiful Princess of Darkness. Alice Obongo! Yes! It's him. Forget him. He must die. Enjoy it, enjoy it, enjoy it! Princess Obongo. The Princess of Darkness. You only have him. Princess Obongo. Princess Obongo. Enjoy it! Enjoy it! Forget him. He's a mere mortal and his life has just expired. Now, his soul is in the hands of the guardian of the night. Princess, do you understand now? You were marked by destiny. It was you, and no one else. You had to succeed me. You're my daughter, and I love you. I feel my lord calling me. Kiss me. May your lips taste the sacred nectar of my sex to consummate it. Put an end to my long mortal life. Princess! My reign is ending. Life is flowing from my veins. I see peace. I've reigned for more than 300 years. Now you will reign, my daughter conceived by Macumba. What's wrong? - I'm afraid. - It's okay, calm down. I don't want to do that trip. Why? I'm afraid that my dreams could be a premonition. Then don't go. But I should go. There's a nice cut in it for me. But that princess, that strange trip— Maybe my dreams are coming true. Then don't go. You're on vacation. Or we can do something even better: I'll go with you. I feel like meeting a princess. Come on. Alice! What's wrong with you? Talk to me. Alice, please! Alice, what's wrong? THE END
