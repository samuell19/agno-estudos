Stop. What? - What do we do? - You have to keep going. We don't stop we outrun that son of a bitch and we just keep going. - What if he never stops coming? What if we can't stop it? - We can do this, okay. Look at me. We just keep running and we'll lose him. - I'm not sure if I want to run away from what we had. I don't wanna never see my family again. - But we had two choices, money, a future, easy life or the same shitty existence. We chose money. I'm not giving up this gold. - Are you sure about this? I couldn't be more sure. - Okay. Look, we can have a happy life, all right? We can have everything we ever wanted. Fuck the past. He's just one obstacle. - Fuck the others? - They just didn't make it, okay. I feel really shitty about that. But trust me, if it was the other way round, they would do the same. - Bell, but-- - No, no, buts. - This is ours, Lucy. We've committed to this. Now you either get out of the car now or you continue on with me. You make a decision. You make it fast, Lucy. - Drive. - Bollock. - What's going on? - I don't know, it's not starting. - Bell, drive! - I can't. What's going on? - Give me, me gold. Can't see, I can't see. What's wrong? Looks like you've seen a ghost. Where is he? - How long have you known? Misha? - A few weeks. - Well, I didn't know when to tell you, when the time was right. - Why did you then wait so long to tell me? - It wasn't easy to come to terms with myself. We haven't even had money to celebrate Christmas. You know, things have been tight recently. We've got no money, Karl. - I know. And now that we have a kid coming into this picture. - Don't worry. - What? - Well, don't worry about any of it, it's fine. - What are you saying? - I can abort the kid. - No. We got this, okay? We're gonna be all right. Like they say, when there's a will, there's a way. Okay? - Karl. After this new chat by Frankie FC, and this is called Macronica. - Hey, Marshall. What's happening, Karl. You got a minute? - Sure, go for it. Look, I've got another job coming. Not the type or anything like that. It's a weird one, but I've got a feeling, you're gonna like this one. Gonna go meet him later for the deal. - Look, mate, I don't wanna do anymore dodgy work. I'm done with this shit, especially the last time. Listen, you've got my word, I promise you, you're not gonna be in anything like the last time. - Look mate, you can't keep promises in this line of work. Christ, we almost ended up arrested. That was fucked up, man. Listen calm down, bro yeah. Come with me to the meeting and if you like it okay, if not I'll still respect you. You know, but I have a feeling you're really gonna want in on this one. Plus all that extra cash will help, huh? - Okay, where do you wanna meet? Marshall. - How's it going, mate? - Been better, fine. - Good, what's about being about the missus, good? - Fine. Good, good. - So what is this job offer? - That I still don't know. We're gonna go and see him about the details of it. I think it's an in and out job. Pick one up give him the money, cash, go grab, that's it. - All right. - You're down, yeah? - Let's go. - You ready? - Thanks for coming. John. Nice to meet you. You must be Marshall? - Good guess. - And your friend? - He's actually my business partner, Karl. - Business partner. So I need someone who can do a job for me. A quick in and out, no hassle. - You've come to the right people, my friend. - That's very reassuring. - So, what is this that you want us to collect? - Well, you may think I'm a bit crazy, but I'm a collector. I collect proof of other beings. - Other beings? - I've always had a weird fascination in knowing there is more life out there than we truly comprehend. You name it, I own it, nearly. What, like Father Christmas? - Now you may think this is some kind of a joke, but what we're dealing with here, is far more than we can ever understand. Over the years, I've collected such trophies as Bigfoot's claw, a Yeti's fur, the sack that Krampus used to collect his children. - Sorry is this some kind of sell? Sorry. - This is why I pay good money. There is a risk. You won't believe me, but if I pay you well, that is the incentive for you to go and collect what I desire. Right? - Yes, sir, everyone has a price. - Good. - So what do you want this time, Rapunzel's hair? - I want the Leprechauns gold. - Right. - At the end of the rainbow is his gold. I want you to go and collect it and bring it to me. - So you would like us to find a little pot of gold, that's at the end of the rainbow. - Yes. - So if it's that simple, why did you need us to go? - Ah, now this is where I need you and your men. If you go, there is a risk that you may lose you're life. - Hold up, you want me and my friends and my team to lose our lives? - These are dangerous beings, creatures that we are dealing with. Acting upon impulse, they will fight to keep what is theirs. - How much we talking? - I will give you 100,000 pounds for the sack of gold. - And if we don't deliver? - Nothing. - Wait, you're sending us on a wild goose chase and we might not even get the money. We'd have to be reimbursed and have something for our time. - I will pay you 1000 pounds each for your time. Fair? - A grant is a grant. - Its a deal. Shake it. This guy is off his tits. - Bro, a grand is a grand. - So what are you thinking? - What am I thinking? I'm thinking we get this done. - Such a completely wasted chase. I mean, no leprechaun exists. - Listen, you know that as well as I know that, let's just get this grand and fuck off. - Okay. When? - Well I'm hearing it's a little risky one. So I'm thinking we could hire a couple of local lads. Split the payment. How does that sound? - Give 'em 500 and we keep the rest. - And it sounds good to me. There's my business partner. - How are you feeling? - I'm better, thank you, honey. - I'm gonna go out for a bit, all right? Where you're going? - I have an odd job, kind of thing, that's needs seeing to. - Please, don't tell me you're not going back to that line of work? Please? Ruby? Look at me. - It's not like before. But I need the cash, all right? I need to sort this situation out. - We can find ways. - No, I will find us a way. You need professional help. Help, I can't afford to get you in a better state with your health. I got this, all right? You trust me, don't you? - Always. - Then trust when I tell you everything is all okay. - We're a little bit exposed here. - What are we doing here, Marshall? - This better be good. - Look, we've been hired to do a job, a quick in and out. - The woods. - Look, some fool has hired me and Karl to find something. If we find it, we get a hundred grand. If not, we get one K for our time. Sound fair? - This better be no longer than an hour. My going rate is usually one K. - Fuck me, I'll take one K an hour. - Look, it's not gonna take long at all, yeah. How can you be so sure? Fuck the time, I want my 100 K. What do we need to get? - See over there, my friends? You find the end of that rainbow, you'll find yourself a sack of gold. If not, we get one K for our time. So let's go find some gold, my friends. - You've gotta be shitting me? Pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. Look, stranger things have happened to me in my life. - Someone's actually paying you for this? - Listen, it's a trusted payer, dealt with him before, so go find yourself some gold, my friends. - All right. - Let's do it. - This is ridiculous. - Yeah, granted, it's weird as fuck. But 100 K, do you know what I mean? What can you do with a hundred K? Kind of grand if we fuck up. - I mean, I could get me a new Louis Vuitton with that. - Yeah, you do love you Louis V. I do. - Hey, guys! Guys, over here. - Find yourself a pot of gold yet? - This is crazy. - It is. But as he said, stranger things. So how did you get involved in this? I thought you were out of it last time. - I was out. But something crept up. Now I need the money. - With what happened last time, it was a mistake. It shouldn't have ended up like that. I hope you know that, right? - It wouldn't make it any different when you guys left me behind, huh? - Still banging on about job gone wrong? Wrong place, wrong time, my friend. No more to say. - Oh, easy said than done. I could've ended up in prison for 15 fucking years, mate. - Yeah well, you didn't. You're here and you're fine, so let's move on, hey. Hey, guys! Guys. - Fuck up. Hey, what is it? I can't believe this. Shit, man, we're rich, bitches! - I literally can't believe I'm saying this. That's not possible. Turns out you can find the end of a fucking rainbow. What's inside that pack? - Who's ready to be filthy fucking rich, people? Look, think of what I'm thinking, this is worth more than his measly 100 grand. We're literally sitting on hundreds of thousands of pounds here, people. - You gonna keep it? - Am I fucking gonna keep it? Finders keepers. You the man. - Hey, wait, wait, wait, how much is this worth really? - It's about half a mill. Like that's a 100 K each. * It's being so long ago since I held you in my arms * * It's being so right, I live through your charms * - Here we go, ladies. - Thank you. - Thank you. - There we go. Chi-ching. This is petrol station's finest. Picked it over on my way up. Phoebe loves it, anyway. - How is Phoebe? - Oh, she's all right. She don't know about the money yet though. - Oh, a surprise. - It's gonna be a little toot tonight. - A toast. To us. To us. - Yeah, baby. - My friends, take your portion and live well. Live like fucking well, my friends. Another? - Are you sure about this? - What'd you mean am I sure? This is my first glass of the night. - That's not what I'm talking about. I mean, what if he... I don't know, what if he's looking for it? And comes after us. - Comes after us? Well, I suggest you start spending. Spend, spend, spend, buddy. Book a flight, take a holiday, put a deposit on a house. That's what I'm gonna do. - You're not intimidated by him? - This guy asked us to help a leprechaun's gold, don't panic. - Babe, I'm home. Sweetie? You in bed? I'm sorry, but the person you've called is not available. Please leave your message after the tone. - Hey, sweetie. I'm at home, where are you? Give me a call back. I've got some, I've got some good news, yeah. Speak to you soon. Is someone there? Babe? Wha, got ya! - Oh, shit. You scared the life out of me. I had to. 'Cause what you did to me last time. - Yeah, but you're a bad girl. I have... I've got some good news for you. Really good news. I've come into a little bit of money. - You promised me you wouldn't fuck about with those guys again. - Babe, nah-nah. It's nothing like that, babe. It's nothing like that at all. I just might to have happened to have won the lottery. Say that again. What? - Maybe won the lottery. - How much? - Just 100 K. - What? No ways? - Yeah. Serious, 100 K. - No way. What does it feel like. Feels good to be rich? Huh-uh. So what you gonna buy me? Well, I'm paying you in kind, you know that. Go away. I'm joking. Oh, baby. Ow. Oh, watch your head there, love. You know, I'm gonna go grab a shower, babe. - All right. - It's being a long day and... Don't be too long, yeah? - Yeah, you just thinking about how you're gonna spend my money. Yeah, I gotta figure out how to spend that cash. I'm sure you'll have a long list. - Hot. - Where is it? - Where is what? - Me gold. - Babe? You all right, babe? - Run! - Who are you? - What do you think I am? Thief. You all just thief's. You can talk to her soon. What do you think happens to thief's? - Oh my god. What's all this? Come on, tell me. - I, um... Shit, how do I say this? We're gonna be fine. - Huh? - Me, you and the little one. - Did you get a job? - Yeah. I got a job today. I got paid very handsomely. - You've got to be kidding me? - What? - No, you promised. You promised that after the last time. Please tell me that I'm wrong? - It's a lot of money. - And what did you have to do for this money? - You'll never believe me. - Try me. Tammy? - Ruby. I thought you coming back home late? I haven't got any food sorted yet. Let me put the oven on. - No. No cooking tonight. We're gonna celebrate. The job. Did me well. We are gonna be fine. - How much? - All you need to know is, your medication is sorted. And for tonight, at least, you're not cooking. We are going out. Finest place you can think of. Steak? You want it? You got it. - Please tell me wherever you got this money from that it won't come back to haunt you. - No. This is clean money. All right? No issues. It's over. Living this way. It's over. I told you. I told you, didn't I? - So we have 100 K? - We have a 100 K. - And you're definitely not shaming me. - Well, if we can manage to sell it, it could be worth more. - Oh, christ. Oh my god. Everything's gonna be okay. - It is. - Right, I love you. Well, lets do that ever again, all right? - I love you too. So what are we gonna do about this gold? - What are we gonna do? I've got one of my divas come around, hopefully we're gonna sell our share of the gold and then get rich. That's what's gonna happen. - What about the guy who originally hired us to do the job? I mean, what are these gonna go look for it. - Well, they shouldn't have hired us for the job then, he should've done it himself. - Got something for me? Right. Well, it sure is real gold. - Great. So-- - So what do you want for it? What price? - Kind of like... - All right, we can take a 100 K for this portion. If you want more, we can get you in touch with others who can give you the rest. You're joking, right? A hundred K? For gold that doesn't even have a certificate. And I don't have an inkling of where it's come from. Let's say, the police track me down. Let's say you two get in the shit. Then I'll get in the shit. This is dodgy gold. And for that, we're gonna need a discounted price. - Stew, you know the price of the gold. We know the price of the gold. - 30 K. That's my offer. - Nel? - I'm scared. - Are you all right? - Marshall, I think something's after us for what we did. - What's going on, Nel? - I'm not joking about, Marshall. - Nel, what's going on? Oh, my god. - Hello? - Ruby, get down to Karl's now. - What is it? - No questions, I'll spill when you get here. Just get the fuck down here, yeah? Shit's hit the fan. - Thanks for meeting me here. - I haven't seen you since school. - Two of your friends have gone missing, Ruby. Nellona Fox and Mick Sybil. We're assuming foul play due to the amount of blood found at the crime scenes. Both bodies must've suffered an immense trauma. - I don't know what to say. - We have you on CCTV a few days ago, Ruby. We have you, and your friends meeting at the Dickings Wood Trail. Your all together and within a matter of hours, two of them are gone. What were you doing down that side of the woods? - We were having a reunion. Just catching up. - Just a year ago, Karl was nearly arrested for a 10 year sentence for robbery. We failed to find pure evidence, but you and your friends were suspected to be involved in this apparent robbery. Now, listen to me. If you are hiding something or someone or you know more than you want to tell me, I would advise speaking up now. - I know nothing. I don't know what happened to them. And if I knew, I would tell you. - I don't feel like you're telling me the whole truth. I'm trying to help you. Police aren't trying to get in the way, be a pain, we are trying to help. We solve crimes, you hear me? - I wish I could help find where my friends are but I know nothing. - Whatever you lot are messed up in, be careful. What ever's going on, you could be next. If you remember anything, just contact me. I'm just trying to help. That's all. - Ruby? - Boo! - What are you? - Where is it? - What? - Don't play games, mate. A double-spawn puppet. Me gold. Where is it? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Nobody likes a liar. Oh. Never lie to a leprechaun. - Welcome. Take a seat. - Thank you. I really appreciate you squeezing me in at the last minute. - No problem. Is there anything in particular that you'd like to focus on today? - Well, yes. - Go on. - I would like to ask you about the job. - You're thinking of a change in career? - No, about the job I have taken on recently that I perhaps shouldn't have. I was desperate but now I'm worried about the repercussions. - And you'd like me to consult my spirit guide to see if anything comes through? - Yes, please. I'm really worried. - Okay, well, let's begin. If you wouldn't mind shuffling this deck. Only your energy channel the right answers. First of all, I'm sensing someone close to you. T. Tanya. - Tammy. Tammy, yes, Tammy. She has a weakened spirit light. May I ask, is she unwell? - Yes. That's the reason why I took this job in the first place for us to make a better life for both of us. She's weak, frail. - You're struggling to cope? I can sense a shift in energy. - I'm constantly worried. I'm just trying to provide for both of us. - I see. My spirit guide senses an arc. A bright path made of many colors. - Colors? - Yes. And at the end may not lie what you're expecting. - You're not making much sense. - Black magic. - I'm sorry? - You've been dabbling in black magic. - No, that's not why I'm here. - You are in danger. You must protect yourself. - From who? - From him. - From that guy, that hired Marshall? - No. He's an evil entity of the oldest kind. He spawns from the ancient valleys of Ireland. - Who is this? - This is an entity, not of human descent. - You can't be serious? - There is only one way to stop him. - How? - The four leaf clover. - A four leaf clover? How is that going to help? - The magical properties of the four leaves combined, faith, love, luck and hope only these can overpower him. - Okay, I've had enough. I shouldn't have come here. You're nothing but a frog. - You must find the four leaf clover to stop this evil spirit. You must end this. - Enough. - It can be found outside the house of faith. - What is going on? - I've got things to be doing. Money to be spending. - They're dead. Mick and Nel, both murdered. No bodies, but excessive blood at the crime scenes. - Wait, if there's no bodies, then it could be anything. - Listen. My mate, Paul, who's just joined the police force said that they're treating this as a murder. Excessive blood. They had to treat it as a murder. - You don't think... John? - Who else d'you think? Of course it's John. He's the one who put us on this job and he's the one who wants his gold back. - So what do we do about it? - That's what we're gonna do. - Fuck, where'd you get that from? - Listen, don't ask me any questions. Don't worry about where I got it from, worry about, I'm here to protect you lot's arses. Listen, Nel phoned me last night. Running from something. She was petrified. I think she was murdered. For fuck sake man. Listen, all of us, we just gotta stick together. Stay in twos. No one's safe. Not one of us. As long as we're in this thing together still. - And how do we deal with this? - How do we deal with this? First things first, we've got to get to the root of this issue, yeah. Me and you, we're gonna go see John. You two, stay here, don't leave each other's side. No one's safe. Not as long as we's got his gold. Serious. Listen, Karl, when we go in the house, don't show any signs of fear, no signs of nerves and we're gonna be a-okay. - Got ya. You think we're gonna be okay? - Listen, like I said before, if you didn't show any signs of nerves, no fear, we're good. - You don't think he's gonna do anything to us? Listen, we're good, man. - She's pregnant. Misha. - Shit, are you serious? - Yeah. So that's why I'm a bit more on edge. More than usual. We need that money. And I want her to be okay. I need to be okay for her and the baby. I don't want her to grow up without a dad. 'Cause I know what it's like. I had that before. - Listen, it's gonna be good. You've got my word. So what you want a boy or a girl? - A girl. I want her to take after Misha. Fuck, having another one of me running round. Your funny. - Right, let's go. - So you found it then? - Listen, just stop what you're doing and leave us alone. - Excuse me? - Listen, two of our men are dead, yeah. And we haven't got any money to show for it. What's happening? - He's laughing. Is this a fucking joke? - You stupid fuckers. You've really gone and fucked it up this time, haven't you? - Fucked what? - It's not me that's taking your men down. That's where you've got this twisted, you hear? - Who is it then? - The leprechaun. You took his gold. - Just stop fucking with us, all right. - I'm not. And deep down, I think, you know, I'm not. - Can't believe they're gone. - Think we could split their cash? What? - Really? Oh, my god. I'm going to the bathroom. - Oh, hey, Crypto's, it's me, the daddy of doom. Thanks for joining me again for this week's new entry. The leprechaun, true or false? The leprechaun has been believed in for centuries, dating back to the 1800s. The leprechaun is said to be an escaped demon who escaped from the wrath of Leviathan. Leviathan is one of the seven devils of the underworld. He is said to have collected creatures and made them work in the dark depths of the underworld for centuries. - Leviathan is one of the seven devils of the underworld. He has said to have collected creatures and made them work in the dark depths of the underworld for centuries. It all goes back to the 1800s, when a leprechaun was sent to earth to retrieve an escape soul by Leviathan. The leprechaun was there to retrieve the soul however, this is where it took a very dark turn, the leprechaun got a taste of the outside world and when he returned with the soul, he told Leviathan that he had paid his dues and was ready to live in the mortal world. However Leviathan was not having it. And he said that the leprechaun could not walk the earth and must live in the deep darks of the cave below. - Please. Please don't do this. - Give me the gold, now! - What the hell? This can't be happening. - Give me, me gold. - I don't have it. - Where is it? - I spent it. No. No, no, please, don't. No, please! - Sick and tired of it. The leprechaun is said to have stolen a bucket of Leviathan's riches and fled to the mortal world going into hiding in the hills of Ireland. This is why the leprechaun is known to hide like a cockroach. He hides amongst the living, never wanting to be seen. A great trickster, a talented hider, blending into any background. However, although the legend goes, he is friendly, but he can turn on a human in the drop of a heartbeat if his gold is stolen. He sees his gold is a victory, a victory of escaping from the underworld. And if a human were to steal his gold, he can open up a wrath of anger inside. Now the leprechaun, he may be small, but he has a golden box, which is why he was originally sent to the underworld to begin with. He was a soul collector. He collected the souls of those who stole amongst the living. And he was sent to the underworld for his crimes. Now, if you betray him, beware, he is lurking, waiting to collect. Maybe to collect you. Well guys, thanks so much for watching this week's episode. Let me know in the comments below what you guys thought of it. Let me know any future episodes you guys would like me to talk about things to cover and stuff. Thanks again, guys for watching, subscribing and all your support and I'll see you guys later. Bye. - What's going on? - Run. - It'll be for your turn. - What is that thing? - Misha? - Karl, what was that thing? That creature, he tried to attack us and it killed Tim. - Misha, where are you? - Oh, I'm with Ruby, but we're driving to you and the car broke down. And we're at Mount Tread Woods. By the church. - Okay, wait there, I'm coming. Fuck. He's right. We've gotta go, now. - There's the thief. - Oh, shit. - An actual leprechaun. I can't fucking believe it. - You told them to take me gold. - I wanted a piece of your history. - Give me back what's mine. Before you can join your friends. Now, what am I doing here? - Hello? Anyone? - Ruby, what is going on? - We messed up badly. I'm so sorry, Misha. - No, I need specifics. Tell me what is happening. - We stole from a leprechaun. We stole the gold from a leprechaun. Now it's taking our souls, one by one until he gets it back. - And what do we do to stop this? - A four leaf clover. We find one and we're gonna finish this with it. Until now, I guess the church is the best place to hide out. - Where we gonna get one of those? - Wait in here. And we'll see. - Please, please Father, look after me and my unborn child. Please. - Ain't no god gonna help ya. - They grow in the garden of faith. I found one. - No, no, no! No, no. No, please, no! Ruby! - Misha. - Ruby, Ruby, please help. Please, I can't get this open. I'm trying. Go! We gotta find 'em. - Ruby, we can't keep running. - We use this four leaf clover to kill it. - It will bite our hands off. How exactly are we gonna do that? - We hold the fucker down and force it down its-- Go! Ruby! Ruby. - I'll be right behind you. - Another soul to keep. Shit. - Ready to pay back your sins? And join the quad? - Marshall! - I can't see. - Run, Misha! - Oh, where d'you get that from? - You can have it, if you want. - Oh, you're not all mean and bastards, then. Misha! - I put something special in. It's got four leaves and it's green. - You did it. - It's over. - They're souls. They're set free. Any day now. - Any day. - You excited about being in our new home? of course. - It was worth it. That gold. - Yeah. - Sweetheart, I'm gonna go have a sleep, all right? I'm gonna let you carry on watching the film. - You don't wanna watch the end of the movie? - I don't even understand it. It's a scarecrow, there's some sort of 48 hour thing. I don't even... I'm gonna go. - All right. - See you upstairs, all right? - Okay. - Shucks, I'm back. - Karl! Karl! Karl! - Go on then, give us a smile then.
