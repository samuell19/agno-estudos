I never believed in angels and fairytales, no matter how much I wanted it, nothing I ever really wished for came true. but I never stopped wishing. Maybe this Christmas will be different. Alanna? - Coming. - Ok. So sorry. I always take that right as the door's starting to close. Could you hit three, please? That's the maternity ward, my first grandchild. Congratulations. Isn't that a perfect way to start the day? A girl, eight pounds four ounces. Are you getting out? No, not this one. OK. This is us. Hi, we're here to see Berry Thompson. Thank you. You both keep holding your mama while you're visiting. Real tight, ok? She's not our mother. Ok, there you go. Come on. - Did you bring me something? - Yeah. Mum needs a smoke. That's a good girl. Thanks honey. Where did you get those? That's a really great thing to teach her. Don't you start with me. I got enough with these cops, doctors... don't even begin to start. Well, they say it's your life so you could be a little nicer. This is a jail Emilie. Ok? I'm in jail. JT, if you got something to say, you say it to everybody, remember? He doesn't like it here. Smart kid. Still carrying around your baseball glove? So what do you hear from your lawyer? Nobody tells me anything. I mean do you know when you're gonna get out again or even... What, what, what! Keep asking me a question, keep asking me questions. I don't know Emilie, I don't know. You know what, you've gotta get it together. You can't do this over and over. I know. I am gonna get it together this time. So give me a break, I'm gonna do it for real. I can't do this anymore. You don't know how many times I've heard you say that. I mean how many times have I dropped everything? Driving all this way to take care of the kids, to bail you out. All right, fine, if it's a problem, just tell me, ok. Yeah and then what? Who's gonna take care of them? If it's not me who? I'm gonna go. I don't feel so hot now. Berry. Well, I'm sorry. Yeah? I'm sorry too, ok? We're both sorry. You guys hang tough. - Eat something all right? - Yeah. - You look really thin. - Well, yeah. Hey, Lani? Tell Jack I'm here, ok? Ok? Don't forget. - Who's Jack? - Nobody. Her boyfriend? He brings her drugs. You two go stand over there with that nice lady, ok? What? When are you gonna get it? You almost OD'd this time. You were dying when they found you, you're own kids... Don't you dare lecture me. I don't need you to save me. If you got a problem with this go back to Atlanta. This is my life. No, this is not your life, this is their life. Do you have any idea what this is doing to them? Yeah, yeah. Yeah? They survived didn't they? We've been locked out of the apartment. Did you know that? You haven't paid the rent in six months. Times are tough, or haven't you noticed? Where do you suggest we stay tonight? I mean where should we go to sleep? You're their mother. Give me a break. Ok. We'll be back tomorrow, so... - And how old are you now JT? - He's almost six. - Hmm. - Is there something I can do for you? - Oh Miss Thompson, Emilie Thompson? - Yes. Ruth Doyle, Child Services. She's scaring JT. Honey, there's nothing to be scared of. - He's afraid she's gonna take us away. - That's not gonna happen. Uh, look the last 24 hours have really... Let's talk privately for a moment, shall we? Miss Russell can watch the children for us. Miss Russell, would you watch Alanna and JT for a minute? Hey, nobody is going to take you away, ok? I'm just going to go talk to her. You stay with Alanna. And we'll be fine, I promise. Come on. Foster care is in their best interest and right now my concern is for the children. They've missed school and healthy living conditions, evictions, abandonment. There's a history of neglect here that borders on child abuse. We feel that a foster home would be a safer environment. But I'm their aunt, I'm here to take care of them. Miss Thompson, I'm sure that you mean well but you have no job here. I'm gonna get one I'm going back to school to be a nurse. I do that. I'm sure that you will, but right now you have no permanent address, you have no bank account, no savings account... But that's because I've given everything I had to try to help these kids. Yeah, and your sister spent it all on boyfriend's and drugs. Are you saying it'd be better if I didn't try to help? What I'm saying... Look, what I'm saying to you is we're dealing with a Rhode Island jurisdiction and you have no history with us. Well, I have a history with those children, isn't that more important? Miss Doyle. Ruth. You can't give these kids to strangers when I'm here now ready to do what needs to be done. I'd really like to help you. Then do it. Well, if you can find a job, open a bank account, establish yourself. Alright, that takes time. Exactly my point. Until then I have superiors I have to report to and guidelines that I have to work with. Yeah, I know this system. Berry and I were raised in it and that is why I am begging you if... That little boy, he doesn't even talk anymore except to his sister. If you split them up he does not have a chance, he needs his family. We make every attempt to keep the siblings together. But you can't promise. No, no I can't. Miss Doyle, do you have a minute? I'm afraid it's urgent. Yes, just a minute. Look, for now this is the best choice for everybody. If you'd like to take the time to explain it to them yourself maybe the transition would be easier. I'll be right back. Hey. Take your brother's hand come on, come with me. Let's go. - JT was right about the lady wasn't he? - Keep walking. - Where are we going? - I don't know. Just get in the car, come on. Not now. Are we going to Atlanta? Right now, it's anybody's guess. Why didn't we stay on the highway? I thought you two would like to see the countryside. Something pretty. Is it because you thought the police might be after us? You're a little too smart for your own good, you know that? Are we lost? No, we are not lost. Just, uh, don't know where we are. Bethlehem. We couldn't be that lost. Ok you guys, come on. Are we there yet? We're at a diner, we need to get some directions, get some real food. OK? You two, you've got to wake up for me. Come on JT. Ok, here's the thing. We've got $60 and some change and it's gonna take us two nights to get to Atlanta from here. Will we have to sleep in the car? The car? How many times have you guys had to sleep in the car? Some. It's okay for me but JT gets cold. Oh, filthy no car, can't be tonight. I'll say. The temperature's dropping like a barrel over Niagara. High summer, ain't a better place in the world to sleep. In a 1950 DeSoto sportsman. Parked high on a bluff, windows down. Sweet breezes blowin' in. Ah. I used to be an adventurer when I was your age. - What's a DeSoto? - It's a car, sweetheart. A honey of a car. Do you know a place we might get a room for the night? Oh, there's Holly McBride's Inn over on Fielder's. Big rooms... fireplaces... four posters! We just need something, uh, simple. A motel? Oh, closest one is way out on the highway, 40 or 50 miles of back road to get there. And even if you do... they'll probably be full up. But if you're gonna head in that direction, you'll go right past the town square. You might want to check out the old Pierce house. Aww, great Victorian thing. Town's really proud of it. It's right across from the angel statue. Is there really an angel? Of course there's an angel. Don't you know, there are angels everywhere. This one watches over that house. It's been empty ever since Miriam Pierce died, oh... seven years ago. She left the whole thing to her niece. Never came to claim it. Sorry... it's getting late, we gotta get on the road. Uh, keep the change. - Oh, thanks. - Thank you. Come on kids, let's go. And drive safely. And don't forget to check out the Pierce house. Uh, excuse me. Come on. Maeve! Maeve! Maeve, can a guy get a cup of coffee here? All right, you just keep your shirt on. Rush coffee on the way. - Unleaded? High octane? - High octane. - Ahh. Please. Please start. Where are we gonna sleep tonight? I'm not sure, but we'll figure somethin'. See there? Everything's gonna be fine. You just got to get through the night 'cause things always look better in the morning, right? It's gonna be ok. It's gonna be ok. I can hardly see the road. It's an angel, just like she said. - What are you doing? - I want you both to stay here, I'll be right back. Look what I found, key to our room for the night. They'll arrest us. Alanna, look, we can't afford the Inn, we're running on fumes and it's freezing. Nobody's gonna know, just one night. And things will look better in the morning? They just about have to, don't they? When your mum and I were little, we'd sleep like that, like spoons. We'd hold hands, so we wouldn't get lost in the dark. Were you scared? Sometimes, yeah. So we'd pretend that all the bad things around us were just dreams. And then we'd make up stories about what it was like in our real life. What kind of stories did mum make up? One time your mum pretended she was a dog catcher. Who'd round up all the sad dogs who didn't have anyone. And she'd drive them to this special park, this beautiful green place, where people would go for picnics. She just let 'em go free, so they could live happily ever after, on leftover ham sandwiches. I wish there was a park like that for sad people. Well, we don't need that park, Lani. We got each other... and I'm gonna work it so we stay together no matter what. Goodnight. They found us, they're gonna send us back. - Stay calm. - No, they are. - Stay calm, I will take care of it. I knew it was too early. We're so sorry to disturb you. We saw the car and the smoke from the chimney. After all these years we just about given up hope you'd ever come back. It was my worrywart sister who insisted on seeing you first thing, pumpkin. She thought you'd appreciate some water and gas. You turned on the water and gas? Oh, it was nothing. Corinna put in our new laundry room all by herself. Me, I'm not so handy but I do bake and I brought you some breakfast rolls just out of the oven. She bakes like this all the time. It's a wonder I'm not 300 pounds and in a carnival side show. They're cinnamon, you used to love 'em. Well, of course I did. And just look how you have grown. I mean the last time we saw you you were only six or seven, so it's not surprising. But pretty as a picture. Oh. You haven't even had time to uncover the furniture yet. Let us help you. Uh, don't worry about that, I'll do that later. You don't even remember us, do you? Agatha and Corinna? Your aunt Miriam's friends from across the street? Of course I do. I used to come over for these cinnamon rolls. That is so sweet of you. You know I would ask you to stay for a while but actually I... Oh, we understand you have to get settled and you need Gerald Foster's say-so to get the electric on. Aunt Miriam's attorney? Mr. Foster. Yes. He's on vacation but he'll be so excited to see you again when he gets back. When do you think that might be? Could be anytime but don't you worry, we won't let him surprise you the way we did. Soon as we hear from him, we'll let you know. Please. Of course he came to see you when dear Miriam died, didn't he? So he won't be at all surprised how pretty you are now. - Hmm. You know you could call Jimmy Kilgore over at Power & Light as soon as they open. Jimmy Kilgore. I taught him third grade and passed him. - So he owes me big time. - Hmm? Now, you may think we're losing our minds but we can't remember your name. We always called you pumpkin but we guess you're a little grown up for that now. It's, uh, Emilie... Emilie Thompson. Emilie. I knew that all along. Well, it's been a long time. Welcome to Bethlehem Emilie, and welcome back. And when you get a breath you come on over and we'll catch up over my mince pie. I will, yes. Thanks again for the rolls. Oh, you're welcome dear. - Watch the ice there Agatha. - I'm slippin'... we're toast. Wow. Ok... the water's on. You two can go wash up, put everything back like it was and we will get on the road before someone else comes by, ok? Come on, come on, grab it and go. Go, go, go. Ok, you guys be really quiet, right? Just look forward. Good morning. Hello. Car trouble? How's your anti-freeze? Oh, I think it's more than that. The engines been acting up for a while. Well, pop the hood, I'll take a look. No, really, I couldn't... You don't have to ask, all part of the job. You know? Kittens in trees, flat tyres, full life. Saw you at the diner last night, didn't I? Yes, we got into town late. Well, I think your spark plugs are probably shot. Spark plugs? You think that might be it? Well, uh, with an engine this, um, old, I don't know, it could be bad points, the timing might be off, you might have oil in your combustion chamber. You know, why don't we just get Mitch over at the garage to take a look at it. You weren't leaving town were you? No, uh, we were just going to the market because there's nothing in the house, so... - Oh... I'd be more than glad to give you a lift. - I'm Nathan. - Nathan. Nathan Blair. I'm sort of the long arm of the law here in Bethlehem. - Emilie... - Thompson, right? - Oh, your neighbours, the two sisters. - Yes. They called me, explained the whole thing to me. They're sort of our local information superhighway. But they didn't get to meet the kids. Yeah. Those are my kids. Yeah. No, I didn't think they came with the car. Tell you what, why don't you gather the kids together and I'll call Mitch and he'll be over here by noon. Great. Thank you Officer. This is really, really important, ok? We need to think of this as a game until I can get the car fixed. What kind of game? Um, a game of pretend. I want you to pretend that I'm your mum. Ok, so you call me mum and if anybody asks you anything you just say, uh, your mum doesn't let you talk to strangers. Ok? Now look, I know it's really bad but I'm asking you to fib, but I don't think we have a choice right now. It's ok, everybody lies. No, everybody doesn't lie and as soon as we get through this we won't either, ok? What do you say? Can we play this game and play it really, really well? Yeah? Your kids are about the quietest kids I've ever met. Mum says we can't talk to strangers. I say you got a very smart mum. You'll find this town's a little more trusting than most. - Yes. Where are y'all from anyway? - We're from Providence. - With the Georgia plate? Well, I used to live in Atlanta, I'm moving back and forth, it's complicated. Hey. JT, what you got there? You a baseball fan? JT Snow? A great infielder. Came out of the Yankees... '92. Is that where you got your nickname? It's his real name. His dad gave it to him. Ha ha, your husband's a big fan then, huh? Hmm. Did anyone ever tell you, you ask a lot of questions? Occupational hazard... sorry. Hmph. That's ok. So where does grocery shopping fall into that job description of yours? Below car-repair, below pet rescue? Alright, you think I'm kidding. But uh, this place has been a nice change for me - back home I was... - You're not from here? No. Born in Illinois. High school, college, eight years on the force in Chicago but seven years too many. When this job opened up, I ran for it. Can we get a cake, Emilie? I'm sorry. Well, um, mum doesn't like it when I call her that but... I do because it makes me feel older... but... she thinks it makes me sound fresh. Oh. You know what? I tried it with my dad once and... he didn't like it any more than your mum does. No. - It's ok, Lani. - Hey, cheer up... your eyes are too pretty to look sad. What do you say we get that cake? My treat. Absolutely not, uh, you've done enough for us already. Come on, next up. You play baseball by yourself, JT? He only talks to me. Yeah? I can see that. Heh. He's just shy. Hehe. Hey, there's a great middle way here. They've got a really nice field. When your husband comes into town I could show him... He isn't, uh, I mean the kids' father he isn't going to be coming. - You raise them yourself? - Yeah. Inside you two. Look, I know you don't me and I don't know much about kids but if there's anything I can do to help... I'll let you know. Thank you... again. Feel like I'm wearing out those two words. Happy to help. So long. Hey... It's the cake you wanted. I didn't buy it. It was probably him. Do you want to tell me what's bothering you? Do you... do you not like Officer Blair, or...? Is that true about JT's father? Did he really name him? Well, your mum did... but apparently it was his idea. She thought it would keep him around... so, that's what she called him. What about my father? Did he name me? Let's not get into this right now. No, I want to know. Well, I don't know, Lani. I don't think even, uh... I don't think he even met you. But you got your eyes from him. And they're really pretty. Just like Officer Blair said. You can't believe anything the policeman says anyway. So how long do you think it'll take to fix this? It depends on what I find. I oughta know something by this evening. Well, it doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to start and go. There's a lot that goes into that start and go business. Yeah. Don't worry, if it's gonna take a while, I got a loaner I can let you have. Not too stylish but it gets around. I'm only asking you for the good of the children. But you don't know what's good for my kids. Nobody around here knows what's good for us. Oh, they know what they're doing around here. Oh really, well I wish I had your faith. And I wish that you would tell me what your sister did with Alanna and JT. If I knew, which I don't, I wouldn't tell you. 'Cause they're better off with her than anything you people have to offer. Berry, what about relatives? We don't have any, we told you. Ok, we're alone, it's me and my sister, check your records. You don't get it. They're already with the best person for 'em. I guess we'll have to alert the police, have them start a search, enough to pull a photo from the Atlanta DMV. Thompson. T.H.O.M.P.S.O.N, Emilie. Can't imagine a niece of Miriam Pierce driving a junk heap like this. Held together with spit and chewing gum. Yeah, she sure is anxious to get it running real soon. Well, it won't be tonight. I can tell you that much. Oil, sticky, tar. Battery's a door stop. Filter's stopped filterin'. And that is just the start of it. No, she's not goin' anywhere tonight. I hate to bother you again but since you don't have a phone as yet, Mitch at the garage called our house. Yes, yes, please come in out of the cold. Power still isn't on but... Jimmy hasn't turned that on yet? I should have flunked him when I had the chance. Well, hello... - Guess you haven't met... - ...your children. - Elana and JT. - Hello. You've been talking to Officer Blair. And he was right about them, they're adorable and so handsome. So, you said Mitch called. He said you have a crack in something called an engine block. Is that bad? I don't know exactly but it's not good. He said probably easier to buy a new car. A new car? Now that's not so bad. A car loan'd be a snap. You've got this house for collateral. Yeah... I wish it were that simple. Well, if you're really attached to it, Mitch'll fix it. He said it would cost about $800. - Hmph. - Is that a problem? Right now, it... might as well be $8,000. Good afternoon. It is as cold as can be. Yeah, weather must have affected our fax machine. We haven't got a fax in two days and that can't be right. - Anybody seen the instruction book? - Not me. Oh, Sadie? Is there any coffee? We've had this little talk. I don't do coffee. I'm liberated. I know, I know, and I wasn't asking you to make it. I just wanted to know if there was any already made. Oh. No. Oh, here's the problem... there's no paper in the fax Sadie, we're out of paper. I'll need a requisition form for that. What's this? License and registration information you asked for. Emilie Thompson, Atlanta, Georgia. Not so much as a parking ticket. That's good. Is that Miriam's niece? What? That wasn't a good enough reference for you? Well, you can take a cop out of Chicago... - It's just a feeling. - Right. Jeanne over at the market said she saw that 'feeling' firsthand. The woman is new in town, - I'm... I'm just helping out. - Mmm-hmm. When you're ready to talk, you know where to find me. Couldn't we just take the loaner car, he could keep ours. As long as the attorney isn't in town our secret is safe. and we're not hurting anyone by staying here but taking someone else's car... No, we can't do that to someone. So what are we gonna do? Well, I'm gonna get a job, earn the money and pay for the repairs. That could take forever. You know we're gonna get caught. The police are probably already looking for us. Which is why I think it's better that we stay here rather than out on the road. I mean no one knows we're here, we'll be really careful, ok? Let me get your plates. Aunt Emilie? Lights! There's heat! What happened? I think Agatha and Corinna happened. - And you know what this means? - What? We don't need a fire, it'll be warm enough to sleep in a bedroom tonight. Our own bedroom? Why not? We've got seven to choose from. - Whoo-hoo. - Wait for me! Oh, phfft... Please let this last. Hello? Hello? Can I help you? Oh, I'm... I'm looking for Officer Blair. Oh, he doesn't come into work till noon today. - Um... - You must be Emilie. I know everyone else in town. - Sadie Miller. - Hi. Fresh coffee in about five minutes, if you'd like a cup. I only fix it when the boys aren't here. So now's your chance. I don't know what they do to it. Thanks, but uh, I just came by to see if he might know of a job opening for a woman who needs to make $800 in a hurry. Oh, the car. Oh, I heard. You know, if it's a job you want... two of Holly McBride's... best people ran off to elope and this is the ends busiest season till spring. That's where I'd start. I'll check it out. The end of the street and you take a left and you tell Holly that I sent you. Thank you so much. Oh. Your little girl would like that, I bet. - Alanna, isn't it? - Yes, she would. You know... we're having an open house here at the station... Christmas Eve. Everybody just kind of drops by. Nathan's playing Santa this year. Oh, I bet he'd love that. I hope so... he doesn't know yet. Can I tell him you 'stopped' by? Yeah, sure. Great. This thing is gonna be the death of me. I don't know how Santa does it, year after year. I was saying, you're some kind of lucky charm walking in here today. Oh, that's a first. I don't think anyone's ever thought me as lucky before. - When can you start? - Start? Uh, don't you need references or an application or something? You're a friend of Nathan's and I'm a desperate woman. Who elopes these days? People in love, I guess. Wonderful for them but I've got a business to run. So, if you don't mind making beds and wrestling with that flue from time to time. No, no, don't mind at all... anything. So, I start first thing tomorrow morning. - Sure didn't waste any time. - And why would she? She comes from hard-working Yankee stock, just like her aunt Miriam. Miriam never worked a day in her life, wouldn't know a lug wrench from a crescent if her life depended on it. You will let us watch the children while you work, won't you? They're upstairs now, colouring away - and they're such a joy. - Ohh... I really appreciate that actually. They're such good company and they can come here every day after school. Have you talked to principal Blevins at the elementary yet? That's my old school. Oh, no, I... actually, I haven't thought about it. Well, come right on in dear, we were just congratulating the newest member of Bethlehem's workforce. Hey, hey, you got a job at Holly's, that's great. Sadie said you wanted to see me. - We did? - Yeah. - Oh, right we did. - She said it was urgent. Yes, yes, we needed to see you because, um... well, I guess my mind's gone south for the winter. Agatha? Uh, because... I made extra jars of that vegetable soup you like so much. - Agatha's soup. - The soup was urgent? It was hot at the time. I'll get it. It'll make a fine dinner. Of course there's quite a lot of it, enough for two, at least. Uh, Corinna dear, I'm not sure I can do this by myself. Oh, well, perhaps you could show Emilie where the school... is. Oh, you're getting the kids set up at school. You're putting down roots. I like the sound of that. Yeah, I don't know, there's a lot to do before I can... No, what you need is their birth certificates and school records. Yeah, if I can find them. This move has been really confusing... Just have their old school send them here and then... was that Providence or Atlanta? You know what, with the car and the job and I-I just don't think I can really... I got it, I'll come by, I'll pick up you and the kids in the morning - and we'll get the whole thing done by... - No! Thank you. Thank you. Hello? Hank. Hello Hank, it's Nathan. Is there anybody here? Can I help you? Didn't mean to startle you. I was in the powder room. No, I just um, I saw the light and Hank's usually got everything locked up tight by now. Yes, well, Mr. Harrison doesn't have my workload. No. You're new here? Yes. Hey, um, where is Hank, uh, Mr. Harrison? At home I suppose, while I'm here tidying up. Trying to get things organised, everything in its place. Can I get you something? Oh, no, no, thanks. Yes. Could you look up an old deed for me? The Pierce house. Miriam's place. That's an easy one. In fact I was just about to put that book in a file... there it is. M through T. I hear her... niece finally came back. There you go, Miriam Pierce. It's not good for a house like that to be empty. It should be filled with life... family. Doesn't mention anything about a niece. Oh, that would be in the probate amendment, at Gerald Foster's law office. - He's still on vacation, you know. - Right. Well, I'll drop by his office in the morning, maybe they can look it up for me. Now, we might get lucky... and there might just be a copy of it... right here. Emilie Thompson. I love that. Says Emilie Thompson. I love that it says that. Oh, it doesn't take much to make you happy, does it? Just a little ink on a page. Don't work too late tonight. In fact, I think you should go home and enjoy yourself. I just might do that. Hah, hah, hah. Oh. Hey, I just wanted to say, um, welcome to... Bethlehem. Hello? Hi. Hah, hah, hah. Hah, did you win the lottery or something? Better, um... Here. - For us? - Yeah. I'm feeling Christmasy all of a sudden. - Come in. - Thanks. Uh, is it something in the water here? I mean, doesn't anyone get a little cranky? Nuh. Cranky's illegal here in Bethlehem. It's right up there with jaywalking and cheating at Scrabble. I-I think, in fact, we have the toughest scrabble laws in the country. Alanna, JT, come look. What's that? It's a wreath. You put it on the door. Didn't you ever see a Christmas wreath before? I've seen 'em, I just never had one before. Well, you know what? I have got something else for both of you. Come here. JT? Why don't you open this one? He wants you to open it. Okay. I... I guess I can do that. It's an angel. If you tell her your wishes she can help make them come true. You, uh, put her on your tree. Oh, well... we never had a tree either. Never? We, uh, moved around a lot so, you know... trees, yeah. Yeah. Come on JT. Well, maybe that could be your first wish... a tree. Come here, JT. It's a angel, Lani. That was, uh... almost impossibly kind. I wish there was something I could, uh... some way to... No, I, uh... Yeah, I've... I've got a couple more deliveries tonight before, um, before it gets too late. - Goodnight. - Yes, thank you. But what if they ask for our birth certificates? No one's gonna ask on your first day. Besides, they're gonna ask me, not you. I thought we weren't gonna be here long. No one knows that yet. It's not gonna hurt you to learn somethin' for a few days. - I know a lot. - Too much. Not the kind of things you should. It's different here. Do you like it? It's ok. It's not like Providence. It's not real anyway. We don't... really belong here. Mmmm. Ohh. Whoa. One bought box... supplies. Pens, pencils, notepads, paper clips... paper for the fax. Now, we'll see what we've been missing. Probably the usual notices: garage sales, apartments for rent. So, what's the latest on you and the niece? No latest, we're just friends. Mm, you forget who you're talking to. You can fool Howie and you maybe can even fool yourself but I know what's going on. - Care to tell me what that might be? - Ooh... I think you know. Sadie, I'm not gonna play, I've got work. And we've got faxes coming through. We gots us two dozen of them. - Garage sale? - No... lost dog. Hey, I know this pooch. Oh Howie, you just know everyone. I got a fire hydrant in front of my house. Oh, that explains it. Bethlehem Police Department, can I help you? Yeah, that'll be here. Christmas Eve. Called the principal and told him your records were being sent. He won't ask again till we've left, so you don't have anything to worry about, ok? Now, I'm not gonna be able to pick you guys up from school today so if you go to the sisters straight away and I'll come get you after I'm done with work. - You got that? - Mm-hm. Now, if anybody asks you any questions... Eat up, I'll be right back. Come on. Yes? I think you've been expecting me. Uh, Mr. Foster, attorney at law. - Ah. - Did I call at a bad time? No, no, no, Mr. Foster, I-I-I have been expecting you. Actually, you look a lot younger than I'd imagined. Imagined? Well, we did meet once as children, I think, but... my uncle, Gerald Foster, he, uh, he took care of all the paperwork and all, so... And you're...? Sorry... Alexander. Alexander Foster. Alexander... not Gerald. Of course, please, come in. Oh... and children. You've got all sorts of surprises for us, don't you? Alanna, JT, this is Mr. Foster, say hello. Hello. Hi. Oh, what... that's a beautiful tree. And this house, it's been empty for so long, I'd forgotten what life was like inside it... Oh, I dropped by to tell you that uncle Gerald is anxious to see you again but I'm afraid it'll be another two weeks. You see, he's found himself on a warm beach somewhere and can't pry himself away but he will be back... ah, Christmas Eve. Just in time for the town's open house. See, heh, uncle Gerald, he thinks they can't do it without him. You know uncle Gerald? Oh yes, I know uncle Gerald. So, we have two whole weeks, That's just wonderful, so wonderful, knowing he'll be back so soon, two weeks. Thank you. Oh, well, you are eager to see him again, aren't you? Ohh... Hmph. Don't you ever take a break? Hey. Ah. No, the uh, sisters wanted the place looking especially festive this year to keep up with the Addison's down the street. Oh. This whole neighbourhood decorating competition's gotten completely out of hand. Ah, he asked me... would you hold this? - Oh, sure. - Look, nobody does. Does Miriam do the lights? I mean, did she used to decorate the house? - Huh. What I've heard she must have had a couple of miles of lights hidden up there somewhere. Really? Hey, before I pick up the kids would you mind helping me look for 'em? I, uh... you know I just don't want to disappoint them. Yeah, sure. Thank you. That's a lot of lights. About enough to... cause a statewide blackout. You know, I think there are more lights in those boxes. Could you check those? I'm gonna transport some of these here. - What's wrong? Something Wrong? - Ohh... this doesn't feel right snooping through all this stuff. You act like it isn't yours. Well, you know it isn't, it was Miriam's, I just... inherited it. It's like the woman never threw anything away. Oh, oh, I think some of these were yours. Want to dig through 'em, relive some memories? - No... my past isn't something I'm particularly proud of. I don't really want to go digging right now. Ok. Sorry, I didn't mean to, you know.... I know... it's ok. Oh... look at that. She's a beauty. I wanted to be a ballerina when I was a kid. You know, I think that's the first truly personal thing you said to me. Well, uh... took three lessons and then we moved and it didn't happen. Nothin' else to tell. You know, I don't believe it. I think there is more to tell. I think there's a lot to tell. and I know for sure there's a lot I'd like to hear about you. Kids are probably wondering what happened to me. It's just... you're doing it again. No, you're pulling away and I-I... I just don't think you want to. I think you want to be close. It's like you're afraid. It's nothing... Don't say it's nothing, say it's none of my business. But don't say it's nothing, 'cause I know better. You know, you are on my mind... all the time. I find myself smiling just thinking about you and you are so beautiful and... you're so real, and you're so good with your kids... - Nathan, please... - It's true, really. I've waited my whole life to feel this way about somebody. Yeah. But you don't know... No, I do know, I know how I feel. And I know that I trust you. - Do you know that I'm leaving? - What? In two weeks. Why? Because... JT, he needs to go to a special school and I mean they both do. You know, Alanna has reading problems and... Wait, when, when did you decide to do this? I... know exactly how you feel, because I feel the same way. But it's not possible. No please, please don't make it more difficult than it already is. Ok. Ok. Ok, you're determined to leave, I hear you... but give me the two weeks. That's crazy. Probably but... I want you to give us a chance. Maybe... I don't know, maybe you'll change your mind... maybe I'll change it for you. I don't know, anything... anything can happen. Just one... two weeks with you. And if that's all it is, at least we had that. What do you say? Oh, really? Thank you. - It's gorgeous. - Hahaha Oh, wow! Just gorgeous! What do you think? It's like at a department store, isn't it JT? We're so happy. It's like the old days when Miriam lived here. This house has been dark far too long. It's incredible. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way... ...did you file these faxes without even looking at 'em? Your the fax man, Howie, I figured you'd get around to the job sooner or later. I've got a job for you, too. Oohh... what's in the box? Well, you know Mr. Dearborne moved to California with his nephew... Did you know there was Winter Carnival in Marshall last week? Yes, but what does that have to do with this? Well, remember every Christmas Eve he used to be our Santa here at the station. Right. No. - No, no, no... - Yes, yes, yes.. Oh, n-no. Please... come on, we'll get you some padding, we'll glue on a beard, no one will ever guess. Sadie, I... don't you think Santa's more... more of a Howie thing? I'm allergic to the fur, big guy. Sadie, I can't. Pretty sure they were... Ow! No, no, not the fax, I got it, a perfect... ohhh... Forget the coffee and concentrate on the names of your reindeer. The kids expect that sort of thing. Repeat after me: - Dasher. - Dasher. - Dancer. - Dancer. - Prancer. - Prancer. Bethlehem Police Department. Oh, Berry... I'm so sorry. I have five years. You know, the crazy thing, I don't even blame 'em. Man, I have blown it. I have trashed my life. Oh, my kids hate me, don't they? No, they don't. They talk about you every day. You're doing good. JT is talking a lot. Not just to Lani? No, you should hear him. I'm sorry... I didn't mean it like that. Take good care of 'em, ok? Yeah, you know I will. Hey... I love you. And I love them, you know? I don't doubt that for a minute. I just keep telling myself... that all of this... I'm missing them. Just surprised I got a pick from that thing up, you know? One minute. Hey, I gotta go, um... Listen, you gotta be careful because they've been asking about you. I told them that I have no idea where you are, which is true, so... it's good that I don't but... just... be safe, ok? Ok. - Do me a favour? - Sure. Will you give 'em a kiss tonight and... tell him it's from me? Yeah, of course I will. Ok. Bye. See ya. - You get through ok? - Fine, thanks. I've got, uh, 200 more for ya... the rest will be coming soon. I wasn't worried. Me and the car sort of bonded through all of this. By the time I'm finished, she'll do more than start and go for you, she'll purr. When you need her back? Oh, well, we're leaving in a week, so, anytime before that. Sorry to hear it happen. We were kind of hoping the town would grow on you. Best you gotta do what you gotta do, huh? Yeah. Library. May I help you? Yeah. I don't know what this is. This is a book. Actually, it's a wonderful book. You haven't you read it? I'll have to answer that. But you'll find it, right over there on that third set of shelves. That section's in alphabetical order, ok? - Ok, thank you. - You're welcome. Anything is... poss... Possible. Anything is possible. It's not true. Why do you say that? I just know. Well, this book... is about things that weren't possible and how they happened after all. You know... when I was your age, I went to Mars, did you know that? - No you didn't. - Yeah... I took a submarine ride to the bottom of the sea, and I joined a pirate crew in a hunt for buried treasure just... like the treasure hunt you were on, that brought you here, and I did it all in books. Because of books... Anything is possible. When... M-Mary Lennox... was sent to... ...the master of Misselthwaite... ...and looked, as many of them had never seen him and by his side with his head up in the air and his eyes full of l-laughter, walked as strongly and steadily as any boy in Yorksh-Yorkshire. Master Colin. Oh, that is fantastic. Proud of you. Oh, it's just beautiful, just beautiful. Agatha it's only a story. She cries at supermarket openings. This is the best book I ever read. Yep, and there are plenty more where that came from. Nathan says Santa might give me a book of my own when we see him Christmas Eve. Well, I'm sure if you want a book for Christmas you'll get one but... you know, we won't be here then. We're leaving the day after tomorrow, remember? No. Alanna, you know we have to go. No! You promised her Santa on Christmas Eve. How could you give her that hope? You hadn't said anything more about leaving, I thought maybe... We talked about it. We had a deal. Emilie. I'm going to get my daughter. - I'll come with you. - No, please. Alanna! Alanna! Alanna! Lani? Hey. Don't make us go. Don't make us go. Here. But that's what you wanted. It's not what I want anymore. I want to stay here where it's nice and people like me. - We have a bedroom and a house. - A house that's not ours. I mean, Mr. Foster's gonna come back and he knows we have no right to it. Maybe we could fool him too. Well, what if we could? I mean... what kind of life would that be, you know? It'd be better than what we had... running all the time... sleeping in shelters and... Nathan's nice. You could marry him and we could be a family. Maybe you could adopt us? It's just... not possible. Anything is possible, Nathan said so. Hmm. Come here. Sorry it took so long. But I think you'll be happy with the work. I just hate to think that I'm the one making it possible for you to leave. Well, if it wasn't in this car, it'd have to be some other way. Thank you. You're welcome. - Ahh, like a kitten. - Haha. Didn't I tell you? Thank you. Bye. No. Christmas without a snowstorm. I've never seen the likes of it here. At ten miles out snow's deep as a Blue Ox. But here in Bethlehem? Go figure Maeve. Go figure is right. It doesn't make sense, Emilie. The kids are both doing fine here, they're doing better, they're fine, we're fine here. We agreed it would be two weeks. I know what we said but tell me... tell me nothing has happened in that time to make you change your mind. Ohh... no, a lot has happened... and I've never felt as loved as you've made me feel. And wherever I go, that will go with me. And, uh... thank you. Thank you doesn't even come close. But, uh... I have to go now. Because it's only gonna get harder for me. No, no, Nathan, this is magic. But the thing about magic, is that it isn't real. In your experience. Yeah, it's all I have to go by. You're running away. You're running away to save yourself from maybe getting hurt. Now, that does not make sense. Well, to me it does. I'm sorry to hear you're leaving in the morning. See, I was hoping to introduce you to the local Historical Society. And my uncle was really looking forward to saying hello again. Yeah, I know we're just missing him but you know, we really have to... No, no, no, you're not just missing him. Didn't you hear? The Boston Airport was snowed in last night. So he's not coming home for Christmas? Not unless it's by dog sled. This is really good coffee. Ohh... Have another cup. You know what, have the whole pot if you like. Mr. Foster? I think I love you. So, I wanted to tell you, that I know two kids that are gonna get to meet Santa tomorrow. No, no. Here? - Yeah? - Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, you bet you will, tomorrow you and he are gonna be the best of friends. ...and a computer game... and a space fighter and a new basketball... No, whoa, whoa, whoa... I'll tell you what young man. You write out that list and mail it to me at the North Pole and then I'll see what I can do. - But Christmas is tomorrow morning. - Yes. And that's why we should always plan ahead. Merry Christmas. Yes, ho, ho, yes... Hello young man. Oh! Haha, I think I know you... hoho... There you go. Wait your turn. Well, who do we have here? A... couple kids who've waited all their lives to see you Santa. And a... woman who's as happy as the kids are. Can I go first? Yes, of course, get up there. Ho, ho, ho... sit right up here, hu, hu. I love you. Excuse me. Kids are going through these things like they're candy. What you got there? It's a book! It's about a horse. And the horse wrote it himself. I guess anything's possible, right? Merry Christmas, Alanna. Thank you. Your turn, go. Come up and see me, young man. Hm-hm... oh. Ohhh... What do you want Santa to bring to you, huh, JT? It's a secret and I can't tell. Wow... Oh. Oh, isn't Nathan adorable? I have to get a picture of him with the kids. Excuse me. I've got a picture for you, but... not the one you want. Tell me there's been some mistake. Yeah, no, uh, I can explain, please, you have to believe me. If you could please, please, just, just tear it up and... I will tell you everything, ok? I want to see my mama for Christmas. Well, that's an easy one... she's right over there. That's not my real mama. Where are the kids? Do they know what happened? The sisters are taking care of them until the social worker from Providence gets here. Should be within the hour. You can't do this to them. How long did you think you could hide here? Because what I've heard about your aunt Miriam and... if she was still alive today to see what you've become... I made a mistake. I lied, I misled you. But I did not have a choice. Everybody has a choice. No. Not everybody has that luxury. It killed me to lie, but if it meant keeping those kids safe, I would do it again in a heartbeat. I never lied about my feelings for you, not one word. Please, you have to believe that. Gerald Foster is here. Do you believe me? Maybe I'll have better luck with your attorney. Send him in, please. Mr. Foster. You're gonna need that suit. Ah, seems I got here just in time. I hear Miriam's niece has gotten into some trouble. Well... ask her yourself. Well, where is she? Oh, don't tell me you put her behind bars? I can explain that too. That impostor has been living in Miriam's house all this time? Said she was the niece and the name on the probate... Well, it wasn't Emilie Thompson, I can tell you that. I saw the name, Mr. Foster, with my own eyes. The new clerk, the woman over there, showed me the records herself. What new clerk? It's just Hank, like it's always been. Oh, sounds like it's all part of a bigger scam. They probably stripped the house of everything of value. I gotta get a move on. The line of kids stretching halfway to Peterman's hardware. Mr. Foster is here to see ya. You up to it? Might as well get it over with. Alexander? I came to help. To help me? Yeah. Seems like you need someone in your corner right about now. Oh, I do... but your uncle is... My uncle... we go to the same family dinners but that's where the resemblance ends. And me... I like to know all the facts before I take sides. Mmm... I'm glad. You won't find anything missing, Gerald. Where's Miriam's good silver? In the pantry, where it's always been. Well? No, no, she lied to us. She lied to all of us. You, me, the whole town. - Did you ask her why? - It doesn't matter. The ends don't justify the means. Not in the eyes of the law perhaps, but still... She and those kids brought more life to this house than it's known for years. - She brought life to you, too. - Huh. My life was just fine before she got to Bethlehem. Oh yes, of course, you had your work... and you had us... and you had your work. It was enough. Then you're too easily satisfied. Now don't argue with me because I know these things. Now, you need someone to love, who loves you right back. And you can't tell me that's not Emilie. I better check on Corinna and the children. They're starting to wonder about their mother... about Emilie. - Did you find the silver? - What about her good jewellery? In her dresser, bottom drawer. Where it's always been. I don't know about the rest of you but this is not the way I imagined my Christmas Eve. I appreciate you making yourself available to us, Judge Jakes. I'd like to settle this matter and get the children back to Providence tonight. And I'd like an all-expense-paid trip to Bermuda, that is not likely to happen. Now, I've... looked over these charges, I've read your report. Yes, yes, you'll see that I've included the history of neglect and the request for state custody. What part of "I read your report" did you not understand, Ms Doyle? Now, Ms Thompson... seems to me, like you've been a very busy woman. Wh... objection Your Honour. The charges against my client are only alleged. Overruled. This isn't a trial but I like saying that. Sit down! Before I remember what a pain you were to babysit. May I say something? Well... never found a way to stop you, go ahead. Uh, Nathan Blair, the arresting officer can verify each and every charge against the defendant. Nathan... finally a voice of reason. Where is he? He, uh, he intends to be here, Your Honour. And I intend to get back to my dinner before midnight. So, anyone got anything relevant to say? I, um... I do, Your Honour. You have something to say, say it. Think before you speak, Alexander. Well, um... I would like to cite the case, um, of... Sheffield vs. Lewis 1972. Ah, you see, in this case, it's, it's very clear that there's this man... woman, named, um, Mrs. Lewis... It's not gonna drink itself. Something on your mind tonight? A woman, I bet. How'd you guess? It's a bar, the odds are with me. - Hey, are...? - Everybody looks like somebody. You want to tell me about it? Not particularly. You fell in love. You know, you're very good at this. Did she love you back? I thought so. She was just makin' a fool out of me. It's complicated. That drink will only, uh, complicate it more. Ok... you're the expert. What do you think will help? She made a mistake. I'd say... - forgive her. - Ha ha ha. I wish it were that easy. You never made a mistake? Not like this one. Well, I'd hope you'd be more original. All of us make our own mistakes in our own ways. But in every case, the solution is the same. I forgive you. There's a lot of power in those three little words. They can change the world... they have. But it's impossible. As a wise man once said: "anything is possible". Wha...? Yes. She told us to lie and she said it was a game. And how did you feel about that, Alanna? Well... at least we got food to eat and a place to sleep. Is that how she got you to lie? Ms Doyle, if you want to interrupt, may I suggest you get your own courtroom! Did she let you go hungry, child? - No, I never... - No. Not aunt Emilie. No. But before, my mum... my real mum... she ran out of money and we'd get so hungry, me and my brother. She didn't care, as long as she had her drugs. I know she couldn't help it but... Your Honour, please don't make her go through this. Do what you want with me but these kids, they have gone through so much already. Do you mind going on, sweetheart? It's important. Once, my brother... he cried so hard, he started to choke and... and I didn't know what to do... and I tried to wake mum up but she used to... I-I couldn't wake her up and... and there was nobody around to help my brother and I thought he was gonna die and I didn't know what to do. Don't cry Lani, I'm ok. All we want... is to stay together in one place... with someone who loves us. Someone who talks soft to us when we're scared, says that everything's gonna be ok. Like aunt Emilie does. She loves us. Please don't make her go to jail, she doesn't belong there. I know... 'cause my real mum does. I understand... why you feel like that now. Your mother needs help and she's getting that. Things will get better with time. Someday, you and your brother will be able to love her again. I'm sure we all agree that this child has suffered enough and I'm sure that Miss Thompson means well but her actions... Your Honour? Could I have a few words here? Hey. Hey, can you guys go outside with Sadie? Just for a little bit? Your Honour, Mr Blair knows more than anyone, how Miss Thompson operates. How she lied repeatedly and how she impersonated another woman in order to deceive this whole town. Nathan? That's true, Your Honour. I'm convinced this woman would do or say just about anything to get what she wanted. So you see judge... What she wanted was to give those children a chance at a decent life. Oh, she lied, to put a roof over their heads... and-and in a world that wanted to pull that family apart, she lied to keep them together. Now... I'm not saying that lying's ever right but... but in her position... I'd like to think I'd do the same thing. Emilie Thompson is the most loving woman. She's the best mother I've ever seen. And all she needed was a... was a support system that worked for her... Your Honour, I have to protest... But he's your witness, Ms Doyle. now she's got one... if she'll accept it. Where she belongs here in Bethlehem. And the kids belong with her. She doesn't even have a place to live. Yes, she does... she can live with me. if she'll forgive me... and if she'll have me... because the truth is, I love her... and I want to marry her. What's happening? I don't know, I can't hear them. I think we should let them handle this alone for now. Come on. - She took the children without any authorisation. - She... What about the breaking and entering? ...she used the house without permission... Shh. Quiet. Can I get semblance of order here?! QUIET! I've come to a decision. Kids! They've stopped talking? You know what? I think we can go in now. Court is adjourned. Congratulations. Congratulations. By the way... I also do weddings. Look at this? It's snowing. So this was our miracle. This is how it happened for us. It was the most perfect Christmas. The best holiday ever... and it was just beginning. Whenever we talked about it later, Emilie always said that that season is a special season... the season for miracles.
