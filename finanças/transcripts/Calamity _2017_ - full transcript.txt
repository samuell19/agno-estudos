Let's continue with music but let's change universe. With a dedication from Lucien to his wife... who will recognize herself. That was you, Lucien. What? Was that you? Of course not. France, we're home. Oh, we are. Mom? Romain!? You scared me. How come you're here? You're not at the seashore? Granny had forgotten, she had tenants. We had to come back earlier. I thought you were at your apartment. I came back here to study. Where's Dad? He had an errand. This is Cléo. We're going upstairs. Nice to meet you, Cléo. We're on our way. Don't look at me like that. You didn't even know we were here. We have a long way to go. We want to avoid traffic. No, I can finally meet her. Your brother is coming with Agathe. We can all eat together. It's not a good idea. Cléo is tired and we have work to do. I've cooked for everybody. You can't just say no. You can't just tell us on such short notice, Mom. Turn that thing off. We're talking. Don't bake a cake. We're not staying. Mom...? I have to tell you something about Cléo. I want to introduce her to you but not like this. Mom...? Mom, stop this fucking... What? OK, we're staying. Happy? So, what's the baby's name going to be? Well... we still don't know. Do you know? I do. In that case... They don't want to tell us. "They don't want to tell us..." You'll know soon enough. Watch out, here they come. So, let me introduce Cléo. Hello. Hi, my name's Agathe. I'm Michael's girlfriend. Nice to meet you. Thanks. Well... Cheers! Mom...? Did you know that... that Romain was a homo? What are you talking about? Well, mmh... Cléo is... is not a girl. It's a... It's not a man either. Well, mmh... Go check if your father's taking care of the drinks. In fact, Mom, Romain is not a homo 'cause Cléo is a tranny. No, a trans. Michael, please go check your father's taking care of the drinks. France!? You knew about it! Are you OK, Mom? Yes, of course. I'm fine. What about you? I've burnt the sauce, so... I'm making some more. So, I have to add extra spice, too. It's normal... Go join the others. I'm fine. I'm fine. Go join the others, I'll be fine. You'd better open the window, something has burnt. So, Lucien, your holidays? Did you have time to rest a little? What? Your holidays at the seashore? Yeah, it was nice. Nice... How was the weather? We can soon sit down to dinner. There's a drop of sauce... What? Just saying there's a drop of sauce... on your cheek. Don't worry. Dinner's ready. What is it? It looks delicious! Fish. Let's eat. The neighbour's there. Can we ever have some peace here... Seems delicious, France. Looks strange... Looks strange, don't you think? Michael! Sorry. That's not what he meant. Mom, I was talking about the sauce. Maybe it's a bit too spicy? I've never messed up a sauce. Well, Cléo is in a band. What do you do in the band? I'm a singer. Cool! What's the name? Calamity. What's she saying? Calamity. I don't understand. Who wants some? I do. Boys, clear the table. I'm going for a bit of fresh air. Can I... Can I have a bit of your wine? Yes. Thanks. You're slender, you are. Well, thanks. Do you work out or anything? I dance a lot. Yes, I dance. You do? That's great. I stopped, due to the state I'm in. I can imagine. They're... totally exploding! Do you want... some like these? I mean, later? No, no. A bit smaller. Smaller? Yep, but it's... I'm only at the beginning of my treatment. OK. Lucien? I can't find the eskimo pies. We still had some. There was a whole box, I'm sure. They'll get over it. No, they won't get over it. Can't you see he's nuts? We were doing fine, weren't we? I'm sure everything can get back to normal. We have to discuss this with him. We have to talk to him. Have a great big discussion, talk, talk, talk... Why didn't you tell me anything? I don't understand. Romain? Do you sleep together? The only thing you want to know is if we sleep together? We're waiting to get married. What are you doing, Mom? I'm making him a bed... Her... Well, a bed. Cléo's going to sleep here. This will be perfect. Mom, I have a bedroom. Stop this! We can't do whatever we want. Things don't happen like that, Romain. You have to be reasonable. You have to live with it. You live with it, if you can. I can't. For a mother, it's normal. It's... You have to understand me. Are you sure about this life you're choosing? You've probably never known a woman. That's it. Forgive me, France. It's my fault. It's my fault. Are you happy? You and Romain? We are. You... You smoke now. Did you talk to them? I did. I found the eskimo pies. Do you know where they were? At the bottom. At the very bottom of the freezer. That's where... That's where we hid them. Remember? The boys ate them all the time so we used to hide them. One was on the look out. The other was in the freezer. I know what. I'm going to throw the freezer away. It's taking up too much space. It's just the two of us, now. I'm going to clean all that up. Chuck it all out. Stop it. Lucien.
