In 1600, the East India Company was set up by Royal Charter to pursue trade with India. They traded in many goods: spices, textiles, tea, cotton, salt, indigo... ...and, of course, opium, on the Calcutta Stock Exchange. But that's a story for another time. I was born more than 200 years later on the banks of the Ganges. By then, the company had expanded from trading into conquest, using its private army to dethrone more and more of India's rulers. Despite being a commoner, I spent my childhood in the court of the Marathas, raised by my father. Here, hold. By the time I was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, at the mature age of 15... ...many rulers knew that the company had overstayed their welcome. This knot signifies our auspicious union. Tie it tightly to ensure it will last for several lifetimes I was one of them. A baby was on the way. I would love to have a girl one day, but a boy would solve our problems. We will have an heir and the English won't be able to take our beloved Jhansi. Are you ok? And we were blessed with a boy. He is so strong and radiant. A son resembling his mother is considered a good omen. I think he looks like both of us. You have given us the most precious gift. The heir of Jhansi has made his entrance into the world. But our joy was short-lived, and a gloom descended over Jhansi. Give him. Give the body to me. We had to secure the future of our kingdom. We adopted our nephew to be our son and heir to the throne. We thought our hardships were over and we could stand united against the East India Company. I hereby declare Anand Rao has been adopted. His name will now be Damodar Rao. But little did we know, this was just the beginning. Careful with that. That's it. Move. Steady. That's it. On there. Can we have some tea? Come! Please sit and join us here for tea. Bring some tea for these soldiers! We hear you are on your way to Agra! Please, tell us the news. Is it true that the company has introduced a new law forcing you to cross the Black Waters? Do they not know this is forbidden? Do you think they care about our traditions? I suppose you have not heard the rumors about the Enfield Rifle. Apparently, the cartridges they give us are greased with cow and pig fat and we have to use our teeth to remove the casing and taste it! This is not possible! This goes against the beliefs of both Hindus and Muslims! They need to be taught a lesson! We've grown tired of being treated like untouchables. Less pay, no respect. We will not tolerate this injustice! The time has come to retaliate. Absolutely. Beatrice! Mary! Where are the children? We know about the pig fat greased cartridges. You have humiliated me and my entire family. We have lost face in society! You will pay for what you have done. Come! (IN ENGLISH) Kill me if you must, but please... - Alexander! - Pease leave my family alone! Please. Now you look to us for mercy. When someone is kicked on the street like a dog, and disgraced the way we were by the British Army, there is no mercy, only revenge. Bring her here. Look at him. Stand up! Poor Captain Skene. His whole family slaughtered like animals. What a terrible, terrible thing. Your Majesty, regretfully, a great number of British subjects have now perished in this revolt. And a great number of Indians, too. You are quite correct, Saleem. This mutiny must come to an end as quickly as possible for the sake of both sides. I do wish we could have this conversation in private, Ma'am. Anything you have to say, I am happy for Saleem to hear. After all, he is from India and I value his opinion in these matters. Well, the, uh, situation has taken a bizarre, even farcical turn. "Chappati movement mystery deepens." Unleavened bread, Ma'am. We've no idea where this practice originated or for what purpose. We suspect it's some sort of underground movement against the company. They're advancing across Agra at a rate, somewhere between 100 and... 200 miles a night. Which is particularly disconcerting as it's rather a lot faster than the Royal Mail. They say lotus flowers and bits of goat's flesh are being passed from hand to hand and the words "Everything has become red" are being whispered everywhere. Whatever its meaning, Ma'am, all this hocus-pocus is spooking our men. Seems to have spooked you as well, Prime Minister. I'm aware of it, that's all. These archaic customs are hampering our efforts to civilize these people. The whole affair suggests this mutiny is about much more than the unhappiness of a few regiments of sepoys and that the East India Company is more disliked than we were led to believe. We have faced these difficulties in other colonies, Ma'am. What's happening in Jhansi? Is that young queen still refusing to submit to company rule? Yes, she is. The Central Indian Field Force is marching to Jhansi now. Seems a rather dangerous time to be opening other fronts. Oh, Sir Hugh Rose has everything well in hand. In the past few days, his men have captured more than 18 rebel forts. Does he think she will surrender? She will have to. She has no army. Her neighbors are all in revolt. We must seize Jhansi before she decides to join them. Doesn't attacking an ally risk pushing her into the arms of your enemies? If she will not surrender, Jhansi will have to be destroyed. I fear if cooler heads do not prevail, the East India Company will tarnish not just its own name, but that of the entire British Empire. Dear Ellis, my Jhansi is beyond recognition. As I foresaw, the ground is turning red with the blood of innocents. Our army was in the north trying to defend the kingdoms from rivals when the mutineers struck. I was helpless to prevent the violence against the British who have made Jhansi their home. Take the children and go! Hurry! Go! Hide yourselves! There is no one here! I've written to Sir Hamilton of the East India Company to suggest we work together to challenge the mutineers, but my letters have gone unanswered. This rebellion threatens Jhansi, my people and all I hold dear. If you have any wise counsel, I would gladly hear it. Dear Sir Hamilton, I write to you with a matter of great urgency. I will not be able to protect the residents of Jhansi, including the families of the East India Company... Please convey my message to Lord Dalhousie. ...unless I am given military support. My own life is threatened. I'm not sure how long I can hold them off. If we do nothing, we will all lose. Send help. This is preposterous. This damned mutiny is completely out of hand! Hear, hear. It was a simple oversight. No one meant to offend the Hindus and Muslims. We've removed the offending cartridges. Well, there's no pig fat or cow fat anywhere near them. Intentional or not, they have taken great offense, and the unrest continues to spread like wildfire. It has adversely affected the local economy. Tax revenues are down. And if they don't rise soon, we could see a serious decline in share price. Perhaps even a run on the stock! Gentlemen, gentlemen, let's keep calm. We've succeeded in the past by keeping the Indians divided. We must simply do it again. - Hear, hear. - Quite right. Everyone ready? Yes, Rani Saheb. And one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and eight. Listen to your body. If the body is unprepared, your enemy will disarm you. Let your breath and your sword become one, and your instincts guide your body. And load. And aim. And fire! And ready. And load. And aim. And fire! And aim. And fire! Come, Badal. - Man's dead. - It's cholera. Highly contagious. The mortality rate is over... I understand all about cholera, damn it! Sir, there's also sunstroke and exhaustion. - The heat... - Don't talk to me about the heat, sir! All everybody talks about is the bloody weather! How bad is it? Three quarters of the brigades are under strength, and a quarter are combat ineffective. If we press on? We could lose those still standing. We must hold the march. Surely, they need time to recover. Sir. Your sword must become your mind and your gut. A split second of hesitation can be the difference in losing your life. Keep at it. There is still much work to be done. So you said when you first began to train me. That was different. You are the best pupil I have ever had. With due respect, she's always been your favorite. I see the same potential in each of them. Hmm. Well, most of them. Do you really think you can train these women to fight like men? No. I will train them to fight better than men. Nana Saheb... can I count on your support? When the time comes, we will be there. As always. Is everything alright? Rani Saheb, your husband's health has taken a turn for the worse. I'm so sorry. I am scared, Gangadhar. Listen to your fear... It will tell you what to do. But without you... our enemies will see Jhansi as weak and see this as an opportunity to attack us. Our neighboring kingdoms of Orchha and Datia have been waiting for this moment. And you will stop them. You will fight them and you will win. You are our greatest warrior. Now you must also be a queen. You have been so kind and generous to me. Your strength and perseverance will be your constant companions. Our ancestors' blessings will be with you always. You should rest. We will talk later. Water? Gangadhar? Gangadhar Rao! Gangadhar Rao! It's time, Rani Saheb. Stop! I cannot follow this archaic custom of shaving my head. I will not have society dictate what widowhood should be. What are you doing? That is not right! You cannot defy tradition! You may leave now. All of you! Leave! What do you mean, leave? Everyone get up! Move it! Leave! Come, my little prince. You are now a prince. What does that mean? It means you must always be just, kind, and an example to your people. I must speak to the Rani. Let me through. Let me through. Make way. Rani Saheb... It is with deep regret that I must inform you that under Lord Dalhousie's Doctrine of Lapse, the East India Company hereby renounces the legitimacy of heir apparent Damodar Rao. With no legal male heir, the company will proceed with the annexation of Jhansi. I am merely a messenger. What has happened to the sanctity of the word? The purity of trust? I pleaded your case as best I could. The Governor General would not be moved on the matter. The British gifted Jhansi to my husband's family over 100 years ago. He was a loyal ally and friend to the company until the day he died. I cannot fail him. You won't. Then help me understand. Profits aren't what they used to be. And annexing the kingdom will provide much-needed revenue. They seized the throne from my son, forced us out of the main palace, and once again, our neighboring kingdoms of Orchha and Datia are plotting against us. Without a title, I have no army with which to defend my people. When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalia. - Ham... - Hamlet. Of course you knew. We can approach another lawyer and continue to pursue your claim in court, but for now... you must assume you are on your own. Beautiful. It is so good to see you dressed like the queen that you are rather than in your male attire. Father. How are you today? A little fragile. Why is that? My daughter is putting me on edge. How so? She thinks the way forward is to fight. I think she should be patient. Unfortunately, she does not have the luxury of time. But violence leads only one way, to anger and more violence. Maybe her father should remember who gave her a bow and arrow, rather than a doll. You have always been not only strong-willed but also defiant and obstinate. And that is why I worry about you and Damodar. And I must worry about all of Jhansi not just the welfare of me and my son. The British have not yet arrived. Do not meet threat with threat. Look to have a dialogue. They are merely gathering their strength. As soon as they are able, they will attack. But we have lost too many men in Datia and Orchha to compete with their military strength. Who said anything about men? If the British are too weak to fight, perhaps they will listen. When have they ever shown that they can listen? - Calm down. - Have you ever had any success telling an angry woman to calm down? This is a crucial time for us. Have faith. Don't be impulsive. There is no need to be aggressive, when we can calmly find a solution with dialogue. There is no need to wage war without giving diplomacy a chance, Manu! I am not Manu. You are in the presence of the Rani of Jhansi. In regard to politics and the welfare of my people I am the final word. I don't understand why that bloody heathen insists on carrying on with this farce. What do you expect, sir? Would you give up your kingdom without a fight? The bottom line is the company wants her head on a platter, and it's our job to deliver it. Have you seen the men? We simply don't have the strength to press on. We must try to reason with her. You can't reason with that Jezebel! If she surrenders, it will save a good deal of blood on both sides. She will never surrender. She needs to be broken and destroyed! I'm thinking of asking Ellis to return. You can't be serious. Why bring in a man whose loyalties are questionable at best? - He could be a great help. - To which side? You have no idea what a storm he kicked up - over the Doctrine of Lapse. - Oh, that was four years ago. A lot of water under the bridge since then. Let's use him while the men regain their strength. If the negotiations fail, then we'll attack. We have nothing to lose by talking. Except our self-respect. Negotiating with these rebels will only encourage others. Rani Saheb. Our spies inform us that the British troops are having trouble with their health. They've been stopped in their tracks by an outbreak of cholera. While they lie in their beds, we shall strengthen our defenses. The British have their own spies. Last night, someone spiked several of our cannons. How many? A dozen. And the saboteurs may return to finish the rest. Only one viable cannon remains: Kadak Bijli. Double the guard this evening. Yes, that will be better. And, Rani Saheb, we must also be watchful of our inner circle. Our movements have been intercepted far too many times. Thank you. - That will be all. - Yes. What do you think? Is it true I'm no longer a prince? Of course not! Who told you that? Because I'm not really your son. So I'm not really a prince? Just because we do not have the same blood does not mean you are not mine. Remember what I told you? - What makes a prince? - My actions. That's right. We must both be brave. For each other, and for our people. I love you. Your father loved you. Never forget that. And no matter what anyone says, you are a prince. And you are my son. Uh, Corporal Meiklejohn, isn't it? Yes, sir. - Writing home? - To my mother, sir. Oh, do you mind if I... - Of course, sir. - Thank you. "Dear Mother, "I feel certain that I shall be... "killed in the storm to come." Well, you will with that attitude, won't you? You're here to lead men. Don't you dare let them see that! Good God, man, where's your courage? Rani Saheb. It has been too long since we have had festive occasions such as this to celebrate our women. All of the foreigners are scared of us. As it is, they have no color on their faces. But whatever small amount they have has been entirely drained! True. We are warriors. The fate of Jhansi is in all of our hands. Rani Saheb, Jhansi stands behind you. ♪ We were marching down the street ♪ We heard the people say ♪ Isn't there a part of you that wants to fight and defeat her on the field of battle? Glory's an illusion, sir. Veils the horrors of bloodshed and death. No. As a shareholder I can tell you, the mood inside the company is bloody. They will not permit the stock to plummet any further. Oh, you're a shareholder, are you? Sixth generation. And we will protect our interests. Our interests, sir. Where? Kanpur, Lucknow, Delhi. Never forget Kabul, sir. The bloody retreat. We thought we had them licked, yet only one man survived. What's your point? My point is, sir, don't preen. Don't underestimate the enemy. Even if she is a woman. She's fought many battles against her neighbors - and never been defeated. - Am I interrupting? - Ah, Ellis. - Sir. Good to see you. Take a pew. Uh, to business then. We're talking about the Rani. We don't have the forces to succeed in a direct assault. And our mere presence here may lead her to ally with the rebels. We need a peaceful settlement and we need it now. She has the blood of Captain Skene on her hands. It was Skene's own troops that mutinied against him. Oh, don't be so bloody daft! She incited them. She has always been a loyal ally, and the mutineers threatened to blow up her palace. She wrote to you and asked for assistance, which under the treaty you signed, you were duty-bound to provide, and you did nothing. Is this true, Robert? His imagination's running wild. You seem to believe yourself in some sort of fairytale where your precious queen is looking for a villain to blame. Your treachery is no fairytale. This wasn't even your first breach of trust with Jhansi. You witnessed Damodar's adoption! Told you. He's obsessed with the Doctrine of Lapse. Oh, enough, gentlemen! This bickering will get us nowhere, whether she's guilty or not. Is a rather important question, sir. We owe these vulgar natives nothing. They're barbarians. After all these years, you still denigrate this land, its people and customs. Just try to talk to her, hmm? Convince her that violence is not the way. Otherwise, I fear the cost to both sides will be staggering. At once, sir. You need another drink. Mmm. Your loose hair is so beautiful, Rani Saheb. It is also a powerful sign of defiance. And the smell is intoxicating. If only I had a man to intoxicate. Oh, Kashi, what will we do with you? If only my hair could have been like yours. You should always dry your hair with fragrant sandalwood and sambrani. I want you to always look and smell beautiful. That way heads will turn before they roll. It means so much to me that I'm allowed to dress you with the others. You're like my sister. I know your true value, Jhalkari Bai. You may be a Dalit, but the word "untouchable" means nothing to me. We are not so different, you and I. We could not be more different. You are royalty. I am nothing. It's the way of the world. It does not have to be. A foreigner has been granted access into the fort. I did not know the British were still able to show respect. Some of us have always shown respect. It has been four years since I last saw you. Much has happened since. You trusted me then, you can trust me now. There is someone who wants to see you. Look who we have here. Hello, Badal. Hello. Do you remember me? You remember how to bless his food. Now more than ever, we must ward off evil spirits. I would be lost without my Badal. When we ride, we ride as one. Rose wants you to end your allegiance to Tatya Tope and Nana Sahib and turn over the province to company control. Why would I do such a thing? To avoid further bloodshed. So when we refuse, we will be attacked? "When"? My decision is made. Then yes, he will attack. Then you may tell him I will see him on the battlefield. Rani Saheb, their men may be depleted, but they are still very powerful. They have captured 18 rebel forts already. I would remind you I am no stranger to battle. I have led armies into combat before, and I will do it again if Jhansi is threatened. With all due respect, fighting a few hundred men from Orchha and Datia is not the same as fighting the British Army! You cannot withstand the firepower they will bring to bear! Do not presume to tell me what I can and cannot do! I apologize. And I did not mean to speak out of turn. I simply... fear for Jhansi. And for you. I appreciate your concern, but I must do what is best for my people, as your queen must do what's best for hers. I would never stand in the way of that. Then we will fight for what is ours. And we will win. I bloody knew it! Did you reason with her? You can't reason with these people. Her least of all. Well, we tried. Now we will do what we must. I'm gonna go and rally the troops. What's left of them. Promise me, whatever happens, the Rani will be taken alive. Her and her father must be treated with dignity and respect. She really wouldn't surrender to save herself? Doesn't she want to live? This isn't about what she wants. That's what you've never understood. She's at one with her country and the people of Jhansi. Hurry, hurry. Freshly made warm bread is ready. Chapatis again! Have I ever told you about Prince Arjuna? No. Let me tell you a tale of another warrior prince from a very long time ago. What will I learn from this one? Stories rarely teach us one single truth. Arjuna was leading his army in a great civil war against those who unjustly took his kingdom. On the eve of the final battle, he rode out to survey his enemy. And there, in the middle of the battlefield, were his friends, relatives and teachers. Arjuna said he could not oppose his loved ones, but Krishna told him he must. Arjuna was faced with a dilemma: fight the war or go against his duty. Of course, Arjuna shouldn't fight. You cannot kill the people you love. Krishna told Arjuna, "Do not think of the spoils of battle. "Of what you might win or lose. "Fight with a clean heart "and let your enemy count his cost." But then, everyone he loved would die? There is a lesson to this. Life is impermanent. We do not always feel strong, Damodar. But we must always follow our duty. I'm feeling scared, Aai Saheb. Aren't you? Of course I am, little one. But a wise king once told me not to fight my fear, to listen to it instead. Look what I found. Hmm! Some snacks? Secret bloody messages! Will you please stop shouting, sir? Captain Taylor found them amongst chapatis they've been spreading all over the country. I tell you, these Indians are sneaky little bastards. Oh, it's in Hindi or Marathi. One of those dialects. Well? "The sun will set early tomorrow." - What does that mean? - It means, sir, that we've lost the element of surprise. Call off the attack. An assault against well-defended walls is suicide. Nonsense. Every week our Queen goes to the temple. She is most pious. I received a telegram from Sir Hugh Rose. They're going to begin their attack on the Jhansi Fort this evening. But, Ma'am, Hindu custom says you cannot fight at night. - Oh, why ever not? - It is taboo. And this superstitious nonsense is exactly why the civilizing presence of the East India Company is so vital. It's time to leave these ancient traditions in the past. Why does he keep doing that? I would assume he is praying for his family. They are also from Jhansi. It's most unfortunate that it's come to this. If the people there had been more reasonable, perhaps bloodshed could have been avoided. As it is... I want no excessive bloodshed! The East India Company have already done incalculable damage to British interests with their heavy hand! I've told Sir Hugh Rose to keep it within limits. No more than is strictly necessary. How do you judge what is "strictly necessary"? I thought you Hindus believed in non-violence? Isn't the killing of a mere ant supposed to be sacrilege? I am Muslim, sir. Oh, right. Well, the question still stands. All world religions urge peace. The sooner the lot of you are converted to Christianity, the sooner we can all live in peace. Religion may have provided the spark, Prime Minister, but this mutiny is about much more than that. The company's zeal for profit has no doubt played a role. The East India Company is the greatest corporation in the history of the world, and it does not need me to defend its good name. I want to hear the news from Jhansi as soon as it comes in. Of course, Your Majesty. My thoughts and prayers will be with your family tonight. Thank you, Ma'am. Push those over to the left... - Salaam, Rani Saheb. - Wa alaykumu salam. You should get some sleep, Rani Saheb. Jhansi does not sleep. So neither can I. How was your visit to the temple? For a few hours, it felt like nothing had changed. What is it? Let me lead the army tomorrow. We've never faced these rifles before. And we need to assess their impact. I trained this army and I will not sit back and watch as they fight without me. Gone are those days when you could jump on a horse, brandish a sword, and gallop on to battle. You must think of your people now, and your son. Everything I do, I do for Jhansi and for my son. One day you will have to choose, Rani Saheb. Goodnight. "To do good to mankind is the chivalrous plan, "And is always as nobly requited, "Then battle for freedom wherever you can, "And if not shot or hanged, you'll get knighted." You are who you were meant to be, Rani of Jhansi. I would love to see snow one day. Check. Perhaps this is my lucky day. At last. Sometimes a sacrifice is the only way out. Checkmate. Left, right, left, right, left! Left, right, left, right, left, right, left! Left, right, left, right, left, right, left! Left, right, left, right, left, right, left! Left! Left! Left, right, left, right, left, right... The smell of the prey. The taste of blood in the balmy air. Gives one a rush like nothing else, doesn't it? Have you ever killed a man, watched him die? The hounds are baying, Ellis. Hmm? And our quarry shall have no escape. My dear Sir Robert, I hope you won't be disappointed. A siege is not a chase. A siege is long days of grinding drudgery and boredom. Bah. We defeated most of our allies on the road to Jhansi. Their walls were less-well fortified, nor were they as well-manned or provisioned. That's just defeatism. Furthermore, the heat will mow us down as effectively as any fusillade. Gun team four! Elevation three. Fire! Reload 12 pounders! Focus flashed at 250 yards! ...0.8 degrees! Fire! Good shot. Sir, these men, they need a break. They've been out here for hours and the heat is relentless. Get back to your post, Meiklejohn! If I hear one more soldier talk about the heat, it'll be 30 days hard labor! - Back to your post, Corporal. - Yes, sir. At least you tried, Corporal. Come on! Come on, on to the next one. There's a breach there. Bloody good show. Fire! Fire! Are we going to die? Don't be afraid. You must trust me. Fire! - Fire! - Reload Fire! Reload! We can't keep up with this bombardment much longer. We're running out of powder and shot. Well, then let's stop this charade - and launch the assault. - At what cost, sir? Oh, damn the bloody cost, Rose! We look like fools out here! Problem on the flank, sir! What's that? Cease fire. Cease fire! Cease fire! Commander, we're being flanked! Tatya Tope has arrived with a relief army! Congratulations. You've finally managed to unite the enemies! Now we can defeat two enemies in one battle, can't we? Save us having to march on Bithoor. Tell Company A and B to join forces on our northern flank. Prepare for attack. Yes, sir. You men, come with me. Tatya has come. He's kept to his word. Rani Saheb. Rani Saheb, Tatya Tope's army sustained too many casualties to continue the fight. And it is with great regret he has ordered a retreat. They have all found shelter in the town of Kalpi. If the fort should fall, he insists you should flee and join him there. You have shown great courage. You have my deepest gratitude. Attend to his wounds. We have lost our only hope of breaking the siege. Gather my counselors and my generals. At once. If any more provinces rise in rebellion and come to her aid, we risk being forced to fight on two fronts again. We can't delay any longer, Rose! Very well. We'll wait till the cover of darkness, then launch our attack. Rally the troops. You know, I was just thinking what a beautiful irony it would be for her to be shot off her horse with an Enfield rifle. Oh, for God's sake, Hamilton. My sisters, these foreigners are unspeakably cruel. They have butchered entire villages, sparing not even our babies and young children, showing no mercy and no humanity. Rivers of blood are flowing through our motherland, and our streams and canals are now bright red with the blood of our brethren. If the goddess Durga can ride a tiger into the battlefield destroying everything in her path, then let us all ride together as her army, each blow from our sabers striking like lightning, instilling terror in the hearts of our foes! Let us take the form of fire and surround our enemies until they burn into ash! We fight till our last breath! I will never give up my Jhansi! We fight for Jhansi! Fire! Stop! You cannot risk your life! Go! On the wall! Get on the wall! - Go, go! - Keep going! Don't let them reach the top of the ladders! Boil the oil! Duck! The British have breached the gates! Search everywhere. You, use the bloody rifle! Come on. Show the men no quarter! Spare the women and children. And burn every village on the Grand Trunk Road. We must find the Rani. And I want her taken alive! Oi, oi, stop it! There'll be plenty of time for that later. Right, you, man, secure the fort! Come. This way. Come. Arrest that man. Captain Robbins, I want a man on every door. This place is like bloody Swiss cheese. Where is she? Hmm? Where is your harlot of a daughter? He doesn't understand you, sir. You need a translator. Unhand him! That's no way to get answers from anyone! You heard him. He's a prisoner, not an animal. Where is your daughter? It may surprise you to learn I understand and speak the English language perfectly well. - Good. I... - Assumed, didn't you? I assumed, sir, that you were our friend. - Take him away. - Sir, it's the Rani! She's escaping out the South Gate! The wind is free to come and go. You cannot control or direct it. Take him away. Damn it! Come on, out of the way! You, go on, clear off! I knew there'd be a chase! Come on! Come! What can I do for you, sir? You can surrender. I only surrender to Ma Durga. Not to mere cowards and bullies. You're not allowed to touch her! I'm allowed to do whatever I damn well want! And you'd do well to remember that, Ellis. Ah, Hamilton, a word please, sir. Yes, sir? You're only to threaten her. Nothing more. Understood? Of course. Only what's "strictly necessary." Isn't that what the Queen, Her Majesty, insisted upon? Your forces are defeated, scattered to the winds. The Jhansi is ours. Jhansi will never be yours. You can no more own she who stands for Jhansi than you can own the wind or the waves. What's she saying? We rely on the strength and vision of the Rani. For God's sake, man, get over here! She's trying to curse us, Ellis! No, she isn't! We will uphold the dreams of this freedom fighter. Hail the motherland! "Sometimes a sacrifice is the only way out." That wasn't the Rani, it was her shadow. Find the Rani! Treacherous little snake tricked us. You have no one to blame but yourself. What do you mean, Ellis? A decoy only works if you can't tell two people apart. We must catch up with her while we still have the time. Ellis, you're with me. Hamilton, you stay here and sort out this mess. It'll be my pleasure. Lick up every drop of British blood, dog! Taste it and remember who your master is! We can use him with the hounds, chasing foxes. Sully our fine hounds with a mongrel like this? He's only good for beating. Except for my tools I have nothing of value. Please have mercy on us. You have other goods to share. Right, love. Give me some motherly loving. Victory to the Rani! Long live Rani Lakshmibai! Damodar. You're ok, right? Are you hurt? His leg is broken. There is nothing we can do. Please, do something. We must save him. There is only one way to save him. Rani Saheb. We must release him from his pain at once. No! If we must free Badal's soul, then I will do it for him. I do not know how much more loss I can bear. One by one, my loved ones are leaving me behind. Trust in yourself, Rani Saheb. Badal lived his life enjoying all of your love. Badal... fighting and winning battles with you has been my greatest honor. Now sleep peacefully, my prince. Well fought there, gentlemen. Good to see you. Unbelievable. Our spies report that she's already made it as far as Kalpi. She's covered more than 100 miles in less than 24 hours on that damned horse. Gentlemen, good morning. Ah, Hamilton, you return. Good. Just in time to discuss our next step. Well, it shouldn't be too difficult to route the rebels. We now have our own troops from Bombay, Madras and the Punjab residency. Says the man who never fired a shot in his life. You really are pathetic, Ellis. Now, I think you're infatuated by that woman. She's more than just a woman. She's an idea. And ideas cannot be captured or owned. She belongs to her people, not the East India Company! Why is he even still here? We need a translator. How's her father? Oh, I should think he's being very well looked after. You know, it's a shame you're more concerned with the enemy than your fellow countrymen. Ellis, sit down a moment, would you? Sir. If you come to Kalpi, I need to know what side you're on. I serve England and the East India Company, as always, sir. When she is captured or killed in the field of battle, I expect you to do your duty. Understood? Gwalior has refused to support us in the mutiny. And our men are beginning to turn against each other. They are tired of defeat. We cannot keep fleeing like a deer before a tiger. You are the only one who has fled. How much more demoralized would our armies be if I allowed the British to capture and execute me? We lost over 3,000 men on the banks of the Betwa. Nana Sahib. I was commanding the forces, not the Rani. We were simply outgunned. What about the artillery? You had more than two dozen cannons. Most were sabotaged by British spies. If we used the ones that remained to fire into the melee, we would have slaughtered as many of our men as theirs. If I were there, things would have been different. We may have been friends since we were children, but that is no reason to continue to act like them. Or have you already forgotten who usurped your kingdom? I was a loyal ally to the British, and they repaid my friendship with treachery. Now we must show them the price of betrayal. Then maybe we should focus on how to win the next battle, rather than debate why we lost the last one. We must attack the British lines at the ravines of Koonch. The terrain does not favor us. They have outflanked us again and again, forcing us to fight from a position of weakness. Rani Saheb. I'm... I'm sorry, but this is urgent. Can I have a word with you in private? We've been betrayed. Your... Your father... Did he suffer? I... I'm fine. Leave me. But Rani Baisaheb... Go. Where do you get all your energy? From you, Baba! Who else? Come on! Join me on my horse. Brothers and sisters. We may have lost Jhansi, but we have not lost the war. Remember carefully while we may stand here united, we are not yet free. Rose, look at this. They cut them down like dogs, the filthy little bastards! Come on! Until the day the foreigners dare not attempt to control our thoughts, speech, ideology, and impose rules on our rights, we must fight for the cause of freedom. Our feet will never falter! Many of our friends and families have sacrificed their lives for our cause, and left the fate of Jhansi in our hands. Today, my father has been taken away from me. Without the umbrella of his love and protection, I am now an orphan. My tears have dried. Now is the time to show these cruel invaders our true inner strength and what mettle we are made from! We women have several forms. Mother. Daughter. Sister. Friend. We must now all unite in one incarnation! Freedom Fighter. Did I not say "No excesses"? It appears they had no choice. No choice? Who forced them to pillage, burn and rape? Who forced them to murder innocents by the thousands? Sit! These massacres will stain the British Empire to the end of time! And granting the East India Company this Charter may go down as one of this government's worst decisions! These events, tragic as they are, may... well, either end this mutiny, or see the start of something much larger. A war of independence. We cannot allow it to be anything more than the former, though the rash deeds of the East India Company have certainly brought us closer to the latter! Sir Hugh Rose has asked for reinforcements from Madras, Bombay and Agra. He will find the rebels and he will crush them! That will be all. Thank you... Henry. Any news from your family? They are safe. Thank you, Ma'am. Lakshmi, give the order to attack. These are our enemies from the north. No. Wait. Make way! There is no need for all of this. I understand. But it's been a very, very long time since the Maratha seat of power has regained its strength. This is too much of an extravagance. I need to speak to Nana. I will get him for you. What's up, Rani Saheb? This is not the way to be acting, Baaloo Nana. We should be marshaling our resources, not wasting them on merrymaking. We need to raise people's spirits. The men will fight better. Start the music! I'm coming. I'm sorry, Lakshmi. But important business calls. Let's go! So, did the troops in Gwalior do any damage to her forces, at all? They defected en masse before the battle even began. They were supposed to augment our troops, instead they joined the rabble. She is becoming a powerful symbol of resistance. Now inspiring even our allies to turn against us. We should have killed her when we had the chance. Ha! We didn't have the chance. If we had, it would have been the right course. Yeah. Next time, if we take her alive, she should be dealt with severely and without delay. On that, we're agreed. And I was right about Ellis. He's gone over to the other side. - We don't know that. - Well, he's disappeared. What more proof do you need? He may be trying to give diplomacy a final chance. And with the loss of Scindia's men, you would do well to pray for his success. He is an Angrezi spy. We caught him trying to sneak into the fort. Mr. Ellis has long been a friend of Jhansi, and I will not see him mistreated. What are you saying, Rani Saheb? You have only just won the trust of these people. Their faith in you is fragile. It needs to be nurtured. If you defend this Angrezi, it's like supporting the enemy. Am I interrupting something important? Sorry. What were you thinking? I was thinking about something you said. You told me you had to fight because one has to be true to oneself. At the time, I didn't understand. But now I believe I do. We hold two different worlds in our hearts. I have always held the beauty of India and her people close to me. And I would have liked to visit your country, where you say there are many good people, like you. I was sorry to hear about your father. I had hoped for a fair trial. I did my grieving on horseback. And tomorrow it is where my fate will be decided. Let me fight alongside you. I cannot allow that. Is it not what Krishna told Arjuna to do? If you were captured, you would be hanged, and that was not part of Arjuna's tale. Perhaps it is enough that I've expressed what I would like to do. I owe you much. More than I can repay in the time we have left. Thank you... for all you have done for Jhansi, for my son, and for me. It is time for us to follow our separate paths. You must promise me you will return to England. Sometimes words are a burden when conveying the deepest emotions. So I will say simply... "My gratitude knows no bounds." It is us that should thank you, Rani Saheb. For everything that you have done. Nobody else would have showered us with love, honor and dignity like you have. Swear to me that these cruel foreigners will not be allowed to tarnish my body. Rani Saheb. We are your shadows. And we will be with you until the very end. They're coming! Excellent news. Excellent news, sir. No, no, no. The rebels. They... They are coming, sir. Jesus Christ. - Call the alarm. - Right, sir. I swear by the soil of our motherland that generations to come will remember our fight as warriors of justice. Until our last breath, we will continue to destroy these foreign oppressors who have enslaved us and plundered our sacred land. May the Goddess Durga give us strength! Attack! Attack! Get a bloody move on! Forward! Come on! Kill every bloody one of them! Fire! My God. We won't be able to break through and help the Rani. Let's move away and attack from the other quarter. We can help that way. Come on! Let's go! She's like Joan of Arc. Take aim! Front rank! Reload! Fire! Fire! We have lately had our attention called to scenes of barbarity in India. Scenes which would make any man shudder. But, at last, the battle has been won. The mutiny has been suppressed. And with such a conclusion, the time for change has come. We have a great duty to fulfill in India. We must use our power in such a manner as to promote the enlightenment and the civilization of those great populations, which are subject to our will. For this reason, we have decided that our duty will be best discharged if we commit its performance to the hands of men who will be accountable to Parliament for their conduct. The East India Company has done many good things. But there can be no doubt, so far as the impression on the minds of the people of India is concerned, that the name of the Sovereign will be far more respected, far more calculated to produce moral and political impressions than the name of a company of merchants, however respectable and able they may be. We propose, therefore, that the East India Company be abolished. The company's shareholders need not be alarmed. They will keep their dividend for more than a decade, at which point, they will be handsomely compensated by the taxpayers of India. I therefore ask to send for the House to approve the Act for the Better Government of India. Hear, hear! So that's it, is it? We defeated the Rani, but lost the company. I tell you, women are going to lose us this whole bloody Empire. Times are changing, Robert. It would do you good to keep up. But this cannot be the end of my story. It seems I, like Arjuna's tale, eluded one single truth. Some say I was cremated with great ceremony under a tamarind tree by the rock of Gwalior. Some say I gave all my jewels to my soldiers worth far more than the bounty on my head. Some say I lived on. And whenever or wherever there were battles to be fought, I would appear to help the righteous triumph over the oppressors. But whatever happened, I live on in a far more significant place. In the hearts and minds of my people. I was but one of many. When you remember my name, take a moment to also remember the nameless men and women whose blood soaked our soil, nurturing the seeds of freedom, allowing them to take root and flower. Use the rights we could only dream of. Then my spirit will live on in each of you, and you in me.
