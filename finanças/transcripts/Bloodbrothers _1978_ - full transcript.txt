YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. YOU HAVE A KID? STONY'S THE BEST KID IN THE WORLD. HE AIN'T YOUR KID. I HAD A KID! I HAD A KID. I DIDN'T KNOW. WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? HE'S DEAD AND BURIED SO LONG AGO, IT WAS LIKE HE NEVER WAS. LOUIE DE COCO, JR. 13 POUNDS, 4 OUNCES. BIGGEST BABY THE FUCKING DOCTOR EVER DELIVERED. I USED TO GET A KICK OUT OF, PEOPLE WOULD GET THEIR FIRST LOOK AT HIM, THEIR EYES WOULD POP. SO...WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, I COME HOME ONE NIGHT, I DON'T SMELL NO DINNER COOKING. THAT'S FUNNY. I WALK INTO THE BEDROOM. IT'S ALL DARK. PHYLLIS IS SITTING ON THE BED. SHE'S GOT LOUIE IN HER ARMS. I CAN'T SEE SO GOOD, SO I GO TO TURN ON A LIGHT. SHE SAYS, "DON'T! DON'T!" I REACH OVER AND TOUCH LOUIE'S FACE. HE WAS SO COLD, I COULD ALMOST FEEL THE BLUE THROUGH MY FINGERS. SO I FOUND A NEWSPAPER... AND I WRAPPED HIM UP IN IT. THEN I DROVE OVER TO OVINI'S FUNERAL HOME, I LAID HIM DOWN ON THE GUY'S DESK, AND I SAYS, "BURY HIM." SHE WAS FEEDING HIM, YOU UNDERSTAND? YEAH. AND SHE TOOK HIM TO BED WITH HER. SHE FELL ASLEEP... AND ROLLED OVER ON HIM... AND HE SUFFOCATED. YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD ANOTHER ONE RIGHT AWAY. NO, NO. RIGHT AWAY! NO. WHEN STONY WAS BORN, I SAYS, "I'LL LOVE HIM, TREAT HIM LIKE I WOULD HAVE LOUIE," BUT UNCLE, NOT FATHER. NEPHEW, NOT SON. FATHER AND SON IS THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD... BUT NOT FOR ME. I STICK WITH STONY. "MAYS GRAND SLAMS SPAHN, 4-3." THAT WAS THE HEADLINE ON THE NEWSPAPER I WRAPPED HIM UP IN. I USED TO LOVE THAT WILLIE MAYS UNTIL THEN. BUT NOW I DON'T EVEN LIKE THE GAME. HERE. COME ON. TO STONY. DON'T YOU EVER GET ENOUGH? WOULD YOU JUST GET OUT OF HERE, PLEASE? GO LIE DOWN. GO TO SLEEP. RIGHT. LIE DOWN. I'M NEVER GOING TO GO TO SLEEP! ANNETTE! IT'S 2:00 IN THE MORNING.
