DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2017 A few hundred miles from the North Pole lies Gotland, amid the Baltic Sea, a bit closer to Sweden than to Russia. Immediately northeast of Gotland... SPRING 1969 lies the island of Fårö, with an area of 40 square miles. DEDICATED TO THE RESIDENTS OF FÅRÖ The island consists of bare hills... small, shallow lakes, sparse pine forest, shifting sands, and cultivated land. The residential population in spring of 1969 was 754. Forty years earlier, it was around 1, 100. FERRY I don't think people here have it worse than other rural inhabitants in the industrialized welfare state. Unemployment is negligible at the moment. Many people have cars or tractors. Families have TV and freezers. Still, there's something alarming about these people's situation. Gotland has the same relationship to Sweden as Fårö has to Gotland. And that really bothers us a lot... because we're all Gotlanders to some extent, even if we're often not considered as such, because we're a breed apart. Outlying areas around a larger urban area will naturally be a bit neglected. MAYOR - What's this municipality called? - It's not that large. What does it consist of? It's a combination of the old municipalities of Bunge, Fårö, Fleringe, and Rute. How many people live in the municipality? About 3,700. - How many on Fårö itself? - 900. How much money does a municipality like this have? A few million kronor. It's like nothing belongs out here. I'd say Fårö is experiencing a decline in population. It's worse for those of us who stay during the winter. - You're a farmer. - Yes. Since when? Since Dad died in '37. That's when you took over? Yes, though I worked during his illness too. FARMER - How big is your farm? - I suppose around 25 acres. How many animals do you have? Now we have three cows and five horses. I think that's it. But there's also that huge pig I saw! - That's a sow. - And other small pigs? We sold them. We only have two now. My sister died from cancer in '57. That was hard. Per was just three years old. And the others? Malin was 14 and Jan was eight. And they moved in with you? No, they've always lived here. We lived together. That wasn't really a problem. They didn't have to move, which was a good thing. What's your daily routine like? I don't really have a daily routine. I do whatever I like. I'm free. That's what's so nice. What time do you get up? I have to do the milking, so I get up at 6:00. And then what? I take the milk in, and then I make coffee. And feed the animals, of course. I make coffee, and then I milk the cows. And then? The pigs need food, and the cows need water. Then I start cooking. Per gets up and helps me. - When does he start his morning? - 8:00. He's young and needs his sleep. He works so hard. - How old is he now? - Fifteen. Then we work in the forest. We work during the winter. We hired a neighbor with a chainsaw to fell trees for us. We just have to take the bark off. We strip the branches off and saw the trees into boards. - When is lunch? - From noon to 1:00. And we water and feed the animals. Then we have our coffee. - And then? Then it's back to work until around 4:30. Then I start cooking, and Per works in the barn. Nighttime is when I bake and tidy up and wash. I'm always working my own shifts, you might say. Do you worry about the future? I don't know. Things will get nationalized. That's a worry. That's no comfort. - It's not? - That's what's hard. - You mean it will ruin you? - Yes, and everyone else. It's not better for us. It'll be for farmers like it was... It's like that already. There are some owners, and the rest are slaves. It's not so remarkable here in Sweden, not for those who have less. Money loses its value. You can't profit from what you produce. It was the same with forestry. The pay wasn't good. It should be better. If the state doesn't take it over. That's the question. What's the biggest problem with being a farmer? The politics, I suppose. The worst thing is we're practically excluded nowadays. What do you mean by excluded? We small farmers can't participate. Especially dairy farmers. I don't think large municipalities are such a good idea. That's when people fall through the cracks. It's that way with everything. School too. With fewer people, you take better care of the individual. It's not good for everything to be large. People are forgotten. Do you feel isolated here? No, I like being alone. That's what's so nice. Better to have few friends than many. I don't have a quarrel with anyone. I'm friends with everyone. I like everyone. I like everything. You shouldn't hate anything. I try to teach my children you shouldn't trust other people. You can trust horses! You can never really trust people. You never know what they're really after. Are your horses your hobby? They're more like my drug. People don't understand that I need them. Or I might as well have a different job. They're so beautiful and considerate, more than people ever are. And reliable. People are never that reliable. - Are you religious? - Yes, I believe... like my forefathers believed. The God of my childhood. That's all that holds up when times are bad. In good times, we don't need our Lord. But I think hard times are easier to bear than good times. I asked to go to a dance once, and my father said... "Yes, you may go. It's no sin to dance. But you should dance like a child." SLAUGHTERING SHEEP Where is your slaughtering done when it's not for household needs? Then it goes to the butcher. How many slaughterhouses are there on Gotland? One. Is there some kind of union? How is it organized? I guess it would be called a farmers' union. But the way I see it... farmers are being taken to the slaughterhouse today and not the sheep. How many sheep are you responsible for? 1,020. Which slaughterhouse do you send the sheep to? I send mine to the Enskede slaughterhouse. Isn't there a slaughterhouse here on Gotland too? Gotland has its own butchers' union. Why don't you send your sheep there? SHEEP FARMER - ENGINEER Gotlanders earn less for all their meat... than mainland producers, for example. Why do you think that is? We're dependent on Gotland's other butchers. We have no other way to process our products, so we have to take what they offer us. So you feel it's a monopoly? Yes, that's how I see it. SWIMMING PARADISE - So all the mail comes here? - Right. I sort it and give it to Hans. He sorts it further, according to how he'll put it in their mailboxes. Then he comes back with the mail he's collected, and I take it from there. I count it and handle the certified mail and so on. Is this house you live in paid for by the government? - It's my own house. - It's your house? It's my house. I rent it to the post office for the enormous sum of 75 kronor a month, including electricity and heat. POSTMASTER I've heard rumors it will be shut down. That's right. In fact, all the post offices will. We're one of the few left in Gotland. They'll vanish in the next round. How will mail be handled then? It will be handled in Fårösund. People with business to take care of by mail will have to travel over there? Either we go meet the mailman, or we go to Fårösund. What time of year do you like best? Summer, of course, though it brings a lot of work. Late summer, like it was last year. September was beautiful. Summer visitors have gone, and there's peace and quiet. That's the loveliest time. I want Fårö to be like it's always been. You have no electricity or telephone? No, I don't. But it's fine. You've never moved away from here? No, I haven't. Of course, I've left to go fishing out on the Baltic Sea and down to Poland and the Russian coast. I got in some fixes, both storms and doldrums. My father was a fisherman and sailed with mail and provisions to Sandön, as I did for ten years after him. But we stopped that in 1943. The knight's castle behind you... Oh, that! I made that as a boy. When I'd get home from school, the saw would go full blast long into the nights. How is the fishing these days? Fishing is going downhill. It's like that all over Sweden. Not just here? It's rock-bottom right now, and not just here. There's always work if you want to work. And if you can work. So that's not a problem. And you have to take care of your tools. They should be fixed and in order for the next season. So there's always work to do. But if you're not out on the water or near it, then you're through. To live in a city or larger town... that would be the end. You couldn't survive. People need their freedom. Who decides what books should be here? That's decided in Fårösund. This is just a branch of the municipal library in Fårösund. Can you put in requests? Yes, if someone here asks for a book we don't have, I can order it from Fårösund. They'll get it and send it out. LIBRARIAN What's the most borrowed book here? We had that book about smugglers... Which one? By Kjell Holgersson. That was checked out a lot. On Saint Matthew's day in 1603, fifteen men from Fårö set out on the ice to hunt seals. There was Jacob, Christopher, Eskil, and Michel Nors. In addition there was Thomas Butlek... Anders Austers, Stefan and Hans Gåsemor, Rasmus and Hans Simons, Rasmus Ringvid, Peder and Bottel Sudergård, as well as Jörgen and Hans Mor. Success eluded them. The block of ice they were on broke loose, and through no fault of their own, the 15 men were carried out to sea. They ate seal meat and slaked their thirst with seal blood. After two weeks they were still alive. Finally, God came to their aid by steering the ice back home to Sweden, and they landed near Nyköping. On the Feast of the Annunciation, they returned to their Fårö, to their wives, children, and homes. These artists had Visborg's canons fire a salute celebrating the successful rescue. On April 20, 1618... this painting was finished in thanksgiving to God for this act of mercy. Someone who lives on Fårö... has lived in a little cabin, on a small piece of land, with potatoes, rye, a pig, some lambs, and eggs they've exchanged at the store for coffee and sugar and such. And so it continued until the 1950s. Then there started to be bigger and bigger boats, more scientific methods and tools. And as a result, those who were younger, who should have been engaged and interested, weren't anymore. They went off to the labor market in large numbers. There was a need for labor after the war, and it was safer, more secure work in terms of pay and such, so no one said anything. Today it's big ships with modern equipment. Not just fishing equipment, but equipment of every kind. Fishing boats that go for half a million. And when it's impossible to sell, you realize it's a disaster. And not just here. The west coast has felt it strongly too. Tourism is important for Fårö. It may not be reflected on tax returns, but you can see it in the general well-being. People earn money selling to tourists and have it a bit easier. If you keep bringing crowds of people here during the summer months... naturally it'll be both stressful for the residents and uncomfortable for the so-called tourists, even those with their own summerhouses. No one will enjoy it here. A vanäset is now endangered, where they're going to build bit by bit. As a boy I'd pick lingonberries there to sell. Those times aren't coming back, but I'll never forget how it looked up there. The tall columns of trees and the heather. If that gets annexed and 6, 000 people move in, what will be left? If the vegetation disappears, it will be a desert with trees, an unnatural environment for Fårö. For years I've wanted to spend an entire day at sea on a boat. I got to experience that last year when I traveled on the Finnhansa to Helsinki. It was a wonderful day that I'd looked forward to for many years. What about the possible bridge over Fårö Sound? That should have been built a hundred years ago. I made a presentation to the Fårö municipal authorities in 1943. They called me "the bridge builder." They thought I was nuts. The earlier they'd started on that, the better it would have been. Accessibility is more of a problem for Fårö... than for us on Gotland. It would be great. That would be wonderful. We catch the ferry at 6:00 a.m. to get to the farm by 7:00, and it's just nine miles. Yes, emergency vehicles sometimes have problems. Yes, I've often wished we had a bridge there, especially when I wait a long time for a ferry. I'd have a permanent, year-round connection that wouldn't cost the municipality a single cent. LAMBING MARCH 15 - APRIL 10 Were you the eldest? No, I had an older sister. She was born in February of 1865, and I was born in December of '66. I also had a sister named Josefina. She was born in '69. One brother went to America. He was born in 1872. Another brother, Viktor Ekman, was born in 1873. My grandfather mostly burned trees for tar, for himself and others. He felt the worst thing he ever did was agreeing to dig up the stumps, transport them, cut them up, and burn them. He'd get half the tar, which wasn't much for a day's work. Traveling between the islands was probably difficult then. There was a plain little rowboat, and there was a larger ferry that could carry horses as well as a wagon. They could row or sail wherever the wind would take them. Of course, in bad weather they couldn't go anywhere. How was sea rescue organized back then? There was a rowboat... the old boat that's up in Ekeviken now. It's going into some museum. When a ship ran aground and was reported, the boat would go out and help them to shore if they wanted, and if not, they would stay there. It worked well quite often, but there were accidents now and then. If we transported a crew, we earned five kronor for that trip. We also had extra drills twice a year. We earned 1.5 kronor for each of those. How else did people earn money? I don't know. In my case... as I got a bit older, I tried my hand at building houses, doing carpentry, and being a blacksmith. So I've been a blacksmith and a carpenter. If someone came asking me to do some work... if I accepted it and did the job, it was a 50-öre coin or a kronor. One kronor was a day's pay. The women wove fabric from wool and cotton... but some of that money went for thread and such. It was like that for hundreds of years. I've remained in the church all along, of course, and I want to continue belonging to the Church of Sweden. I want to do that. Wasn't it hard getting to church in bad weather? The weather could do whatever it liked, but once you'd decided to go to church, you went. One Christmas morning, I had sanded the roads here in Salvorev. The question was if anyone on Fårö wanted to work on Christmas Day. Of course, no one wanted to. So they asked people from Fårösund and Bunge. They were supposed to come. But then the northeaster set in with winds and a snowstorm, so when we got to just outside Gåsmora, they'd been overturned by the snow. But we continued on to church, and it was fine. GHOST FARMS How many years have you been on Fårö? I'll have served here seven years as of June 1. Have you been well-received? ASSISTANT VICAR Yes, I certainly have. I mentioned before that attendance is good at services, as well as at other church gatherings. And when you go out to the cottages and farms and talk with people... especially the elderly, naturally... you see that there's so much deep and genuine faith. I confess that I have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed... and I know that if you were to judge me according to my sins, I should be cast from your sight. But you have promised, Heavenly Father, to meet with gentleness and grace every repentant sinner who turns to you... and, trusting in our Savior, Jesus Christ, flies to your fatherly mercy. You will be devoted to those who have sinned against you... and never again judge their sins. Therein I place my trust, poor sinner that I am, and beseech you to keep your promise and forgive me all of my sins. In your holy name... amen. The body of Christ, broken for you. The blood of Christ, shed for you. Does the religious indifference of today's youth worry you? No, it really doesn't. But of course you wonder sometimes... how it will be in the future. Do you plan to move to Visby? Yes. There's no work for preschool teachers here. Maybe move into town. I'm going to move away. - Do you like Fårö? - Sure. Sure, in the summertime. - Not during the winter? - No, it's boring here. - How do you like Fårö? - It's nice. - I'm going to move away. - Why? There are no jobs here and nothing to do. I'm planning to move to the mainland fairly soon. Will you stay here on Fårö or leave? I'm not sure. - Do you plan to stay? - No. Why not? There's nothing to do, and there aren't any jobs. - What are your plans? - I don't know. I couldn't leave this place. Growing up on an island, you want to be near the sea. It would be strange not seeing the water. - How do you like it here? - It's nice. I think I'll probably leave. It's no fun. There's nothing to do. What's the nightlife like? That's just it. There's nothing to do. We're looking into building a youth center here in Fårösund. The municipal roads are pretty slippery, because they have no sand. Shouldn't the municipality take care of that? Yes, we've brought several motions before the school board... but nothing's been done. - What's their reasoning? They say it's important, but it will probably take a big accident. Then they'll look for who's to blame. Alpha looks like this, and little alpha looks like this. Big beta looks exactly like our regular B, but little beta looks a bit different. Then we have this letter. What's it called? Ronny? D. Yes, just like our D. What's it called in Greek? Lars? - Delta. Aina, what would you like for the school? Not a lot, actually. I think things are good for the most part. But more funding for field trips and excursions would be good for us out here in the sticks so that we could go on more trips, like to the city... or to the Bunge Museum in Gotland. Of course we have some outings, but we can only take a longer trip once a year. TEACHER Many kids have only been to the city once, and then it's for the doctor or dentist or department store. They don't get to see the things worth seeing. This old school is... There's something in the walls. It's an atmosphere you can't get at a new school. I'd say the Östra Skolan is on its last legs. It will be gone in a few more years. The schools will be centralized in Fårösund. I guess that's fine, but there are so many children from here, the Fårösund school wouldn't have enough students otherwise. - You don't want to leave here? - No. DEAD FOREST We'd only been married for 3 1/2 years when he died, and I had to take my children... - How many did you have? - Two boys. Nils, who lives here, was just a month old, so he was baptized when we held the memorial for his father. Exactly one month later. I had work up there. His name was Albert I had work and lodgings there. I had both children with me. I earned ten kronor a year, and I made it last through Christmas. Sometimes it was barely enough, and I had to ask him... What about clothes for the boys and such? I could buy a little here and there, and I could sew, so that helped. And then you broke your leg? It happened like this: It was getting dark. It was the day I turned 36. It was Hilarymas Day. It was dark... and I couldn't afford a light for my bike. I rode on the left, just in case. But as I passed by Fridgårds... where Mrs. Broström lived, two cars approached, and one came right at me. I was riding on the left. It was Gunnar Verkelin who drove right into me. I went flying into a ditch, and the bike landed on my leg. They took me to Mrs. Broström's, then they drove me home and set me in a chair, and I had to manage the best I could. Then my son Manne came home. Not the one who's here now. That's Nils. Manne's my older boy. He ran over and got the Smiths, and they helped me into bed. So I lay there with a broken leg for two months with no help. Where did you and the boys live then? The boys slept inside, and I lay in the kitchen with a snowdrift over me. - A what? - A snowdrift. Not really... but the place was in bad repair when we moved in. - So the snow got in? - Yes. The weather was terrible at night. Mrs. Broström brought the doctor, who said it was just dislocated. I told them it was broken. Both bones were broken and the heel was cracked. That must have hurt a lot. It really did. And it was terribly cold. I was bundled up in so many layers for the cold. So I lay there for a day. RETIREE Then I propped my knee up on a chair and started working. It's incredible, but it's true. And Ebba Ringbom was there. She was there at first, but she was supposed to start school. So she went off to school. So no one was there. How did you end up at the hospital? The bone never really healed. Oskar Karlsson came and said it looked deformed. It had twisted to the left. He said it wasn't going to heal. I couldn't even walk in shoes. I'd stuff my galoshes full of paper so that I could get around and milk the cows. Albert had never been sick, so he couldn't really understand. So then I went to the hospital. How did that go? They drove me there... I didn't see the doctor until March 15. He scolded me for not coming in earlier. Why did they amputate? It had gotten infected. The toes had gone all crooked, and some tendons had contracted. Who took care of the boys? They were big by then. Manne, the oldest, was 15, and Nils was 12. He was working for the Smiths. Manne had to stay home and work for Albert. He had to cook, but he turned strange after that, so he went to the mental institution. When did things get better? With my leg? The first thing, once I got... I had to pay for it myself... 228 kronor. I'd been clever enough to save a man at sea, and for that I got some money, the Carnegie Award. I shouldn't be bragging, but in any case I could buy this leg. Not the one I have now. The one before this. What was that like? At first I tried to dance, and I collapsed on the kitchen floor. I wanted to try dancing. After a few days, the stump swelled up and turned black-and-blue. This Albert that you worked for, do you feel any bitterness toward him? No, I didn't have anywhere else to go. We stayed with my brother a while, and he went half crazy having me and my boys there. So I was just happy I had somewhere to live. As for work, a young person can manage. And we had food, so we didn't starve. People died of hunger back then, you know? Albert had plenty of money. He just didn't want to spend it. - So he was a bit stingy? - Yes. When did you marry? January 4. Had you been engaged long? Almost three years. When did you two decide to get married? It hadn't really been long. And now a baby's coming? - Yes. - You want a boy or a girl? - It doesn't matter. - We want a boy. It doesn't matter to me, but Ove wants a boy. Why a boy, Ove? It's always good to have a son. He's thinking he can help out. You go fishing... You have company when they're a bit older. It's hard with the school situation. The little one will probably go to Fårösund. And it's hard if you want to go on working. There's nowhere to leave the baby. There's no daycare center here like in cities. You plan to go back to work? I'm thinking about it. Part-time, anyway. If I have somewhere to leave the little one. What do you say, Ove? As long as it works for the little one. May I ask who you vote for? Who I vote for? Yes, politically. I've always been a Social Democrat myself. Are you interested in getting involved in local politics and decision making? No. Why not? That wouldn't be a good idea. You're a fellow with strong opinions, aren't you? Couldn't it be interesting? No, I don't think so. With a baby on the way, won't you feel isolated out here? No, I don't think we'll feel isolated. Some days I'm at home, but there's the car if I want to go somewhere. And Ove's here on the weekends. So I don't think so. But if they move the road, it could feel lonely. Now you see all the cars drive past... but if the road's moved, it could feel isolated. GERT GUSTAVSSON, 4 MONTHS Democracy is said to be equality. The people of Fårö can hardly interpret the word in that sense. Along with other rural communities, they're deprived of many fundamental rights that are self-evident for urban residents. Democratic socialism for Fårö would mean Ingrid Ekman could run her small farm without worry. Artur Johansson could live off his fishing. Aina Larsson's school budget would allow her students to see their own country. There'd be enough sand on the roads so that Erik Ekström wouldn't risk driving the school bus into a ditch. Fårö's youth would have a proper gathering place right on Fårö, not over in Fårösund There'd be daycare for Birgitta's little boy so she could return to work if and when she wanted. Verner Larsson could earn a proper price for his products and not be exploited by a monopoly. Residents here could keep their post office and enjoy regular bus connections with Visby again. Arvid Andersson could finally get his bridge over Fårö Sound. Rural communities are poorly organized and not especially skilled at speaking up for themselves. In a highly industrialized welfare society, their work is often underappreciated by the urban masses... and measures taken to help them are often stuck at the "investigative committee" stage. That is hardly democracy or equality.
