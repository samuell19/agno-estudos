[voicemail] Hey, Beth, it's Jules. How are you? It's been forever. Let's get coffee, or hike, or something. [knocking] -You need any help? -No, I'm fine. [woman] Okay. -The double-smoked bacon and cheddar. -[server] Anything else? Um... Yeah, do you...? Could I get, like, a... large Americano? [cell phone ringing] Hello? [woman over phone] Hello, may I please speak to Beth Anderson? -This is she. -Hi, this is Taylor from Piper Brook. We spoke yesterday. -Yes, um, of course. -Gwen loved what you had to say. So we wanted to invite you to an in-person interview. -Uh-- Yes, that would be great. -I know it's late notice, but would you happen to be available today at 1:00 p.m.? Um, let me just check my schedule. Yes, I spoke with my assistant and I can definitely make that work. -Wonderful, I'll email you the info. -Perfect. Thank you so much. -[cell phone ringing] -[sighs] Hey, hey, sorry I didn't call you back. You know, in some families there's a limit to sibling privilege. How much longer do they need you there? The Atlanta office is a hot mess. Another two days? You said that a week ago. Look, I really appreciate it. Things are just taking a lot longer than I thought. Well, Birdy misses you. -Mommy? -She's right here. -Mommy, Mommy, Mommy! -You tell her. Hi, Mommy. Hi, sweet girl. Have you been having fun? -When are you coming to pick me up? -Um, soon. Are you coming to my ballet recital? Of course. Mommy, when are we going back home? Will you tell your uncle that I had to go to a meeting but I'll call you soon, okay? -I love you. -Okay, love you, Mommy. You're enabling her. She's got a lot on her plate. Honey, she's always got a lot on her plate. -[sighs] I gotta go. -Have a good day. -Spare a dollar, miss? -Not today. [elevator dings] -May I help you? -Beth Anderson, we spoke earlier. Oh, yes, so glad you could come in. Why don't you take a seat? -Thank you. -Can I get you a water? -Oh, no, I'm fine. -Still or sparkling? Uh... -So any other questions for me? -No, this has been great. Beth, I'm so, so glad you came in. We'll let you know. Fantastic. Okay. By the way, I love your shoes. Louboutins? Calvin Klein. Adorable. -[server] What can I get for you today? -Hi. Could I get a burger, just a regular hamburger, and a medium lemonade. And that'll do it. -That'll be $6.42. -Thank you. [distant sirens wailing] [cell phone ringing] [phone beeps] Beth, I need to talk to you. What is going on? I'm really worried about you. Please call me when you get this. [urinating] It says here you can have vivid dreams. Have you been dreaming a lot lately? Yeah. Last night I dreamt I was stabbing you with a needle in the ass every night. It was awesome. Well, impatience is also a side effect. [chuckles] [gasps softly] -[car window shatters] -[car alarm blaring] [Beth] Hey! Hey! Fuck! [music playing in the distance] [cell phone ringing] [sighs] -Beth Anderson. -Hi Beth, it's Taylor from Piper Brook. Yes, of course. You just caught me getting out of spin. How are you? [knocking on window] I'm great, thank you. Gwen wanted me to thank you for coming in. -Yes, of course. -You need to leave now. -No problem at all. -This is a nice neighborhood. Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to invite you to the next round of interviews. Oh, okay. May I ask why? -We're sick of people like you here. -I'm sorry, I can't disclose that. -Do whatever it is you do-- -But we'll absolutely keep your resume on file. Gwen loved you. Excuse me for one moment. I am on the phone. Give me two seconds. Two seconds. -Thank you so much. -Have a great day. I'm calling the police. No drugs that I saw, -but she's obviously homeless. -Excuse me. I don't know if she's a prostitute or what. -How dare you? -Hey! You crazy bitch! You need help, lady. [car horn honks] I'm going! [car horn honks] [melancholy music playing] [doorbell rings] -Uh, hi. -Hi. I thought you weren't back until Thursday. I got an earlier flight. Well, um, come in, B's playing upstairs. Um... -I'll go get her. -No, not yet. I just need a second. -Do you want a water? -No, I'm fine. Okay. -How was she? -She was great. Are you okay? It was... really good catching up with you. Sorry. I'm sorry. It was a long, long flight. -Everything's fine. -Your business is your business, but you have a daughter who needs you. -I know that. -Things are different now. -Yes. -It's not all about you anymore. Okay, well, thank you for the reminder that I'm a fuck-up. Oh, come on, Beth, don't do that. No, I'll just make sure not to ask you to watch her anymore. Great, because that's actually what I want. -Great. -By the way, Stacy thinks you're on drugs. So there's that. [door opens] -[Beth] Thanks again. -Mm-hm. You have everything? Yeah, we're all set. -Bye, B. -Bye. -We'll talk soon. -Mm-hm. -Bye. -Bye. -Mommy, where are we going? -Strap in. Ouch. [cell phone ringing] -Hi. -Hi? I have an owie. -Is she okay? -Yeah, she just cut herself. -What? -Yeah. Um... -Come in. -No, sorry. -Sorry, I know you have a lot going on. -Um... -I don't, really. -How did the embryo thing go? It went well. We're sort of playing the waiting game now. -Is Stacy here? -No, she's at work. What the hell is going on? Could I get a Band-Aid for her finger? [sighs] Uh... I guess I'll go get it. [sighs] [Stacy over the phone] I forgot one day. I don't think it's a big deal. It's important. D3 and zinc, and I think we should consider a CoQ10 supplement. Honey, I love you, but you're stressing me the fuck out. And I didn't wanna say anything, but you were drinking coffee this morning. A little caffeine is fine. Look, I'm in deposition, I'll see you tonight. Okay, I love-- "Cleric Alwyn burst through the tree line. 'We cannot slow, my lady, the orcs are upon us.' " [chuckling] What the fuck is an orc? Well, if you'd read the first book you'd know. Come on, you know I hate this nerdy mumbo-jumbo. People buy this nerdy mumbo-jumbo. -This is a good picture of you. -You think? -They wanted me to wear makeup. -No, it's good. You look smart. How come you never wrote your Billie Holiday book? Here. [humming] She seems really happy here. She likes being outside. Sometimes when I look out the window, she's hugging the lemon tree. It's a little weird. So I have a really big favor to ask you. Can we stay here for a little while? -Really? -What? -You're really asking me this? -I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. -What's wrong with your place? -They're fumigating. I'm gonna say that's a lie. Fine. I'm moving. We're moving. -I put all our shit in storage. -Why? I don't wanna talk about it, okay? It's been, like, a lot. [sighs] So can we stay here or not? Your timing is so awful. I know. I'm sorry. I'll talk to Stacy. [Stacy downstairs] I just wasn't expecting to see Beth in our living room as soon as I get home from work. I've had a long day... -How long is she staying? -[brother] You know, for a night or two. -Let's hope it's just a night or two. -I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. May I be excused? You don't wanna finish your lima beans? -They're icky. -Just one more big bite. They are icky, huh? Why don't you go watch TV? -And then in an hour, we'll do bath time. -Okay. -So how long will you be staying? -Just like a week. Maybe two weeks. I just signed this new lease and there was this weird non-overlap thingy. Thank you. I really appreciate it. And Birdy loves you guys. Well, we love her. -Oh, and I'm not on drugs. -I'm sorry, what? He said you thought I might be on drugs. I'm not on drugs. And to be clear, I haven't done drugs since college. I'll go grab dessert. Guess what this week is? Mm... -Is it Christmas? -No. -Is it Halloween? -No. -I forget. -It's my birthday. Oh, of course, only the greatest day of all time. And I was gonna wait to give this to you, but I thought you might like it before the recital. [Birdy gasps] -Do you like it? -Mommy, I love, love, love it. All right, let's try it on. [sighs] [kisses] Wait, wait, what do you mean they're pushing it back? No, the print run was scheduled for this week. Benny, nobody wants another biography of Billie Holiday right now. -Especially one written by a white guy. -Are you kidding me? It was proofed, it was done. They can't do this. We're just hitting the pause on Billie. It's smart. Let's maximize the profits on Oracle first, then you can go all David McCullough on me. All right? We are gonna make you bigger than George R. R. Martin, my man. -Oh, Jesus. -No, you are Jesus to these people. Book two is selling eight times as fast as book one. Eight times. Did you read the new contract yet? I don't know if I can do another three Oracle books. Hey, you've got the whole story already outlined. Just, you know, stretch it out. Also, we've had calls about the film rights, but I feel like we can hold out a little while, drive it up. I gotta go. I'll call you later. I'm gonna drop her off. Do you need any errands done? No, I have that signing, so I'll be out anyway. Like, people actually wait in line for you to sign their nerd books? -Oh, my God, are you like their king? -Shut up. Can I come? -You wanna come to my book signing? -Sure. Okay, yeah, I'll give you the address and, um-- -But no big deal if you can't make it. -No, I'm definitely coming. Text me the address. -Bye. -Bye, Mommy. Ms. Anderson. I thought that was you. -Hi, Esther, how are you? -I'm great. I'm great. I noticed that your brother has been picking up and dropping Birdy off lately. -Is everything okay? -Everything's fine. Sorry, I'm running late to this incredibly important presentation I'm giving. -So could we just talk later? -Actually, I've tried to call a couple of times this past week. It seems we still haven't received Birdy's tuition for the fall semester. That's so weird. I-- I'm positive my bank issued the payment weeks ago. I triple checked with the bursar and we just-- We still haven't received it. -Maybe the bursar is wrong. -Oh. She's not wrong. Okay. I'm gonna call the bank and I will get that straightened out today. Great. That's great. Oh, and, you know, we love Birdy. We just wanted to make sure that-- -Okay, all right. -Of course. I will let you go, and have a great presentation. -Thank you. -Okay. [Ben] Well, I mean, let's be real. Tropes are gonna trope, right? [all laughing] -Yeah. Thank you. So... -[gentle applause] So to answer your question, I suppose, yes. In that case, chapter 16 is perhaps a Rorschach test for... -Medieval intersectional feminism. -Yes, for that. Awesome. We're gonna wrap things up. Yes, you in the back. I had a question. I was wondering how the orcs were written so realistically. 'Cause I have read a lot about orcs, but this was by far the best orc portrayal that I have seen in quite some time. Good question. Well, actually, my sister is an orc, so that's why. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] Thank you. Did you really come to my signing to troll me? I couldn't help it. Sign my book. -I could just give you a copy. -No, I wanna support you. "To Beth, you suck. Love, Ben." Lovely. -Mr. Anderson, I am a massive fan. -Thank you. When is book three coming out? Um, book two just came out. Oh, no. I know, but, like, are you almost done? I can show you another series you might like. Thank you. God, these people make me wanna drink cough syrup. So Birdy wants a birthday party. I'm thinking Disneyland. Do you wanna come? You know my strong aversion to amusement parks. Also on a scale of one to 10, how much does Stacy hate me right now? She doesn't hate you. There's a strong undercurrent of malevolence. She's just full of hormones and exhausted. Ooh. -How much is that? -One forty. I'm not gonna buy it. I'm just gonna try it on. -So how come you're not at work today? -I took a sickie. I thought we could hang. -When's the last time we did that? -I don't know. The day Birdy was born?

Oh, an Uber! Okay, I'll take an Uber. [man] Watch out, watch out, watch out! Oh! Oh, shit. Ah! Are you okay? I am so, so sorry, dude. I did not see you. Are you all right? -Here you go, man. -Thanks.

I got laid off. And things haven't been going great. Oh, shit. Yeah. Well, the mall's expanding. I think they're adding a Nordstrom Rack and some outlet stores. There's a job fair all week. I-- I don't-- I don't think I'm a good fit for retail. Oh, well, you never know. [car approaching] -Thank you. -So can I get your number? Take you out for drinks, not in a parking lot? -I have a 5-year-old daughter. -That's cool. [classical music playing] [sighs] -[classical music continues] -[car arriving] What the--? Okay.

You know what this means. What? She knew we'd let her stay before she even asked. [scoffs] Don't get me wrong. I love your sister, I do. I love her, but she is a blood-sucking vampire. -That's-- -No, I can't do this anymore. I won't do this forever. Once we have a baby, no more free childcare. -Boundaries. -Yes, boundaries. I need you to say no to her, occasionally. Occasionally. I do. I can. I will. Oh. -Can I get you something for your eye? -No, I mean, uh, there's nothing you can do that will make it heal any faster. Besides, this is your time to relax. Do you want a bath? [cell phone ringing] -Hello? -[Esther] Hi, Mr. Anderson? Yes, this is he. Hi, this is Esther Mulligan from Birdy's school. I'm sorry to bother you, but no one has come to pick Birdy up. -What? -Yeah, she's just sitting here waiting. I, um... I'm sorry, I'll, uh-- I'll be right there. -Hi, I don't know what happened. -Oh, it's no problem. It was some form of miscommunication. Really, it happens more often than you think. -Great. You ready to go, Birdy? -Actually, while I have you, and I don't mean to be indelicate, but is everything okay with your sister? What do you mean? It's just that we still haven't received Birdy's tuition, and it's almost three weeks overdue. And we don't obviously want Birdy to lose her place, but... No, no, no, of course not. -I'll talk to my sister. -Great, great. Hey. I got dinner. I wasn't sure what you'd like, so, I got extra orange chicken, and... ta-da! -I can't have that. -I've had it before. It's really good. Oh, no, no. I mean, I can't drink. -I can't have alcohol. -Oh, shit, duh. I-- I just-- I saw it and I thought it would be nice. I wasn't thinking. -Do you know where your brother is? -No. He got a call from the school. You never picked up Birdy. What? I thought you were picking her up. Why would you think that? We didn't talk about, like, a schedule. I just-- I thought you were picking her up 'cause that's what you've been doing. Here's a good default. Just assume your child is your responsibility until you hear otherwise. [indistinct voices on TV] [sighs] [sighs] I'm really sorry about today. It's fine. Are you supposed to drink? Doesn't it, like, kill sperm or something? No, I can drink. You guys have been through hell, huh? Hasn't been good. -Has it made it worse having Birdy here? -No, of course not. Maybe a little. It's all gonna work out. You guys are gonna be great parents. Thanks. [cell phone buzzing] [Beth sighs] Who's "Do Not Answer"? [buzzing continues] -Guess. -Are you serious? Yep. -Why is he calling you all the time? -I haven't talked to him. He's left a couple voicemails... saying that he's been thinking about us and he... wants to be part of Birdy's life. I can't tell if it's horseshit. This is the guy who left you approximately 20 minutes after you told him you were pregnant. Pretty sure it's horseshit. I don't know. Well... you're gonna do what you're gonna do. -Good night. -Night. [mouse clicking] [sighs] Shit, shit, shit. Shit. [ambient music playing] [ambient music continues] [sighs] [knocking] [Ben] Beth, you're gonna be late for work. -It's just insanely frustrating. -I know. I mean, it's like, after everything we've been through... She acts like she doesn't even care about Birdy. -It drives me crazy. -[Ben] I know. [Stacy] Promise me we won't ever be like that. [Ben] Like what? I just don't wanna be a bad mom. -She'll be gone in a few days. -She can stay until Saturday. And that's it. I want us to have a good weekend. Just us. -Okay? -Okay. -I'll tell her, I promise. -Thank you. Okay, I'm gonna go. Find some time to write today, okay? Where's Birdy? Oh, she's just getting her backpack. -Your eye is looking better. -Don't lie. [chuckles] -So, what's on the agenda today? -Oh, you know, nerdy mumbo-jumbo. So I can actually pick up Birdy from school today. -I can leave work early. -Okay. Oh, and I'm actually picking up keys to our new place. The landlord says we can move in on the 31st. -Great. -Yeah, it'll be nice. A fresh start. -You need me to pick up groceries? -No, no, we've got it. No problem at all. I'll take care of it. I better go. Thank you. -Have a great day. -[Birdy] Love you, Mommy. [cell phone ringing] [man] Thanks for meeting me. [clears throat] You look really great. Really pretty. [clears throat] I... I'm doing this program. Therapy and making amends... apologizing. And I don't wanna interfere with your life, but... I want you to know that I'm sorry for everything. And... [clears throat] Uh... I've been thinking about how I've really messed things up and... I wanna make it up to you, if you'll let me. I wanna be in Birdy's life, and I'd like to be in your life too. I mean, I'm making a lot more money now, and I don't know, I just-- -I wanna help out. -I'm gonna go. This feels weird. Why? -Are you really in therapy? -I really am. I know, sometimes I don't even believe it. I just wanna see Birdy. I mean, can I--? Can I just come by? I'm actually moving right now, so we're staying with Ben for a while. Okay. -Well, maybe I could stop by some night. -I don't know. I don't think so. -Thank you for coffee. -Beth. Beth. [cell phone ringing] -Hello? -[man] Hey, Beth. It's Marcus from the Rollerway. Oh, hi. Hi, I was just calling wondering how your brother's face was. -Uh, it's better, thanks. -Good. Good. Listen, I don't know if you're free tomorrow, but I got these tickets and-- Oh, uh, Marcus, you seem like a really great guy, but I... -I have a lot on my plate right now, so... -I get it, no problem at all. But, hey, if you change your mind, you got my cell now, so... -Thanks. -Okay, bye. Oh! -Oh, I'm sorry. -It's all right. Let me help you. I just wasn't paying attention. -Here you go. -Thanks. -Have a nice day. -You too. I'll get these as well. Sorry, it's not working. Oh, um, let me just try another one. -What are you doing? -Can't park in the red zone. What? I'm really sorry. Could you please not tow my car? It's not up to me. I'm having, like, a really shitty day. So could you cut me some slack here? I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's already been called in. Tell them when you got here the car was already gone. Here's where you'll pick it up. [indistinct muttering] [woman] It's just these men. These men, they just... ...to be my special day. I mean, it was my day. It was just my-- And then she came in and he just started staring at her. Like, so, so, so disgusting. These men, they just wanna buy jewels for their mistresses. That's all they do. That's all they do! Do you want one? Huh! Stay away from me with your junk. I don't need that shit. I don't need your bullshit fucking food. I don't need it. I've booked a couple co-stars, but I'm just trying to get up to that guest-star-slash series-regular level. You know? So how long you lived in LA? -All my life. -Oh, cool. That's so funny, because normally, everyone is from somewhere else. You don't really meet too many LA natives. What do you do? I'm an account executive. I work for Tesla. Oh! Tesla? That's awesome. Yeah, it is. Can you just pull over and let me off over here? Oh, okay. ["Keep Us Whole" playing over speakers] [cell phone ringing] ♪ You played your part ♪ ♪ Dogs rained down ♪ -Hi. -Hey.

[funky music playing over speakers] She's gotten really into dance. And her school has this jazz and ballet program. And her teacher, Mrs. Mosher, says she is actually reading at a third-grade level, which is kind of frightening, but also amazing. -What's wrong? -No, it's nothing. It's just, uh... It's hitting me how much I've missed out on. -I'm gonna give you some money. -No. No, no, listen, before you say no, just please consider it. I don't want anything in return. Honestly, I haven't supported you, and that's gonna change. I owe you. Do you remember this? Nope, come on. Let's go.

Where were you? Do you know how stressful it was to wake up this morning and you weren't there? I had to tell Birdy that you had an important meeting. I'm sorry, I just-- I went out with friends and I had too much to drink, and I didn't wanna drive home. Wait, I thought you said your car was impounded. Never mind. Here. Get your car. We have a doctor's appointment. We'll see you back at the house. -Hi, Beth. -Hi, Esther. I'm sorry I haven't been in contact with the bursar yet, but I have this check, and I'm just-- I'm gonna get it cashed and then I'm gonna pay Birdy's tuition. -It's okay, it's already been paid. -What? Your brother, he paid for it. Oh... I just wanted to say that you should be really proud of Birdy. You really should. She was such a prima ballerina today. She has such natural grace and poise. All right? You should be proud. [sighs] Hi! Hi, sweet girl. -Mommy? -Hi. Hello. I'm sorry, I missed your recital. Were you the best one? -Yes. -Awesome. Hey, so why don't you guys go to your appointment, -and she and I will just hang out? -Oh, I don't think that's best. Yeah, we can take her now and you can go sort out your car and head back to the house and change, or whatever. No, why don't you go to your appointment and... I'm here now, and I'm fine, we're fine. So we'll just take an Uber. -Okay, we'll see you at the house then. -Okay. Come on. Mr. and Mrs. Anderson, the doctor will see you now. Thank you. [inaudible conversation] [breathing softly] [inaudible conversation] So if the average is six to nine cycles, then it really is just a numbers game. Sorry, I can't deal with follicle counts and presumed egg quality. And to be frank, I don't like Dr. Bagdasarian. -Really? -Yeah. I don't like his face. And honestly, what's the cost of these fucking shots? Am I going to get ovarian cancer in 20 years because of all the chemicals? Do we even really know what the long-term effects are? It hasn't been around long enough. There's... I don't wanna do this. Well, we don't need to do it right away. We're supposed to wait -another six to eight weeks. -I mean, I don't wanna do another cycle. Honey, there's a 70 percent success rate within three cycles. -So all we need to do is one more. -I think I'm at the point where I just... can't. Oh... Yeah. -Was I--? Did I--? -No. Oh, God, no. I just think I... -don't want it bad enough. -You don't want-- To go through this. To put us through this again. We're gonna be okay no matter what, right? Yeah. I'm gonna stay at my sister's tonight. I just, um... I just need some space. Is that okay? Yeah, yeah, of course that's okay. Just take whatever time you need. [mellow music playing] Why don't you go inside? I'll be right there. Okay. Hi, honey. Where have you been? I don't know. I'm tired. Okay, well, why don't you put your jammies on? Okay. Hey. -What are you doing here? -Can we talk? -Where'd you go this morning? -Honestly... I freaked out. [chuckles] I just... Like, I saw you sleeping, and you looked so beautiful. And it reminded me, I don't wanna be like my dad. You know, never seeing his kids, and, uh... I'm just... scared. I just don't think I'm going to be good enough. [sighs] Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. You can't. You cannot do this to me again. I'm not doing anything. Look, I gave you five grand. Can I just, like, get a little time to...? -What a fucking mistake. -[scoffs] You are so... selfish. You know, why does everything have to be on your timetable? Like, why can't we just see what happens? Like, let me see her and we'll just do what feels natural. -Oh, my God. -What? What do you need? Like, what? Five hundred a week, 1000? -Listen, I'll pay you. Come on, hey. -Let me go. -She's my daughter too. -Let go of me. Okay, fine. But you can't keep her from me. Fine. We don't even need your money. Here, just take your check back. -Oh. You bitch! -[Ben] Hey! It was an accident. Get the fuck out of here or I'm gonna call the police. We were having an argument. I'm really sorry. -Get the fuck out! -Beth, I'm sorry. Fuck! [tires screech] Are you okay? Here. Has he ever... -before? -He always had a bit of a temper. Why didn't you tell me? Why don't I know these things? How can I help you when I don't know these things? Maybe I don't want your help. Everything is not always on your shoulders. I know. Where's Birdy? Um... Reading in her room. Where's Stacy? She's at her sister's. I take it the appointment did not go well. I'm so sorry, Benners. I don't know if I can put her through this again. You should burn that. You can't will a baby into the world. You guys will either get pregnant or you won't. And it'll be okay either way. Mm-hm. [sighs] You'll get another job. -You'll find something. -I know that. It just kind of makes me feel... extra bad. It's like... not only am I not where I wanna be in my life, but... it's kind of all my fault for not figuring it out. It's not your fault. Do you remember that Irish poem that Mom used to have on the fridge on a magnet about, like, the road rising to meet you or whatever? I've been thinking lately that... I don't think I have ever had that feeling. Not even like a little bit. So... I don't know. [sniffles] Maybe, like, for some people, the road just, like, doesn't rise to meet you, or whatever. That's really dark. Mm. This is starting to sting. What an asshole. Hey, look.

[scoffs] Please. Dance with me. Okay. Okay, so don't be mad, but I saw your Billie Holiday manuscript. What were you doing on my computer? I only read the first chapter, but it's so good. It's so good. It's so much better than Orcs in The Ice. -"Oracle in The Ice." -Whatever. It's ridic. Why don't you publish the Billie one? 'Cause no one wants another biography of her by some white guy. And they're gonna pay me a shit ton to write three more Oracle books. -Oh, three? -Mm-hm. Christ. Oh, fuck that. They want three more of those, they can publish your Billie one. It's about timing and branding, and you wouldn't understand. Have you seen your Facebook fan page? You have like a million likes. Like, real likes, not, like, Chinese bots. -Mm. -That's serious leverage. [cell phone ringing] [Ben] Are you serious? Hey, Joshua. Yeah, it's Ben. No, you cannot talk to my sister 'cause you're a fucking criminal. And if you try to contact us again, I'm calling the police. I need some water. Thank for the money for my car and for Birdy's tuition. I'm gonna pay you back. Don't worry about it. Do you know I have this notebook where I write down everything that I owe you? You don't owe me anything. [car approaching] [engine stops] [door opens] I'm sorry. I'm sorry I tried to scuttle off to my sister's like... -some cowardly little crab. -Well, I'm sorry if I... put too much pressure on you. I just want everyone to be happy. So if you don't want a baby, we don't have to have a baby. Your-- Your breath reeks of red wine. Oh... -Sorry. -It's just really pungent. But... honey, I want a baby. -Really? -Yes. That hasn't changed. I just don't want a pregnancy. But that doesn't mean I don't wanna be a mother. Maybe we look at surrogacy... or even adoption. I don't know. For once in my life, I don't... I don't have any immediate plans for my future and it feels really fucking great. [Stacy] Mm. Mm... You really need to brush your teeth. -Okay. -Okay. "'Archers at the ready.' The Green Lord stood at the base of the sunlit tor surveying the tauran bivouac above the--" What's a tauran? I think it's like a goat-man? I don't know. -"Above, the wyverns circled--" -What's a wyvern? Mommy, how come we don't live in a house? -What do you mean? -Jessie said her mom said we're poor. -What? -And we don't live in a house. Well, Jessie's mom's a bitch. Don't ever say that word. And we're in a house now. Uncle Ben's house. Gremlin, you know I will always take care of you. I'm sad you missed my ballet recital. -Happy birthday, Birdy. -Happy birthday, Birdy. -Happy birthday, Birdy! -Happy birthday, Birdy! -[Beth] You wanna blow it out? -[Stacy] Blow them out, make a wish. -Oh! That was so good. -That was excellent. Happy birthday. I'll see you guys there. [gentle music playing] [woman] Beth Anderson? So you haven't done retail before? No, but I think I'd be a great fit. AA in business admin, cool. But, like, with your work experience, you seem kind of overqualified. That's nice of you to say, but... I'm actually looking to make a big shift in my career, and I love people. Interacting with them, talking to them, selling them... things. I'm just not sure where we'd put you. I could def see myself doing home goods. -Accessories, women's clothing. -I don't know. Makeup. I would be great at makeup. Do you know anything about makeup? Actually, I have a black eye right now. -What? -Yeah. You can't tell because I have concealer, and the foundation, and then eyelid primer. The concealer, it's actually green tinted, so it helps cancel out the purple. Oh... That's awesome. Do you mind if I ask? How'd you get a black eye? I have a really shitty ex. Girl, say no more. [cell phone ringing] -Hello? -[woman] Hey, is this Beth? -This is she. -What's up? It's Dakota. -From the mall. -Oh, yeah, yeah. So we're gonna offer sales associate. It's full-time with benefits, pretty lit. -Oh, wow, okay. -I mean, I know it's a pay cut, -but we do offer commission. -No, that's sounds awesome. I accept, absolutely. Look, I know this might be a little forward, but is there any way I could get an advance on my first paycheck? I totes get it, holidays coming up, but unfortunately, until you fill out all the payroll, blah, blah, we can't issue you a check. Oh, sure. And... And how long until I could get my first paycheck? Like, we're still stocking, but if you wanna come in on Monday and help with that, your first check would come two weeks after this Friday. Two weeks. Okay. Thanks. Um... I'm really excited. Cool. I'll email some stuff for you to fill out -and then we'll see you Monday? -Sure, I will see you then. You're gonna kill it. Hashtag "boss-ass bitches." Thanks. [pop music playing over speakers] Hi. Your daughter's a natural. She's never even skated before. I guess she's just one of those creepy kids who's good at everything. -What's her name again? -Birdy. Birdy. That's real pretty. Never heard that before. Her real name is Barbara. It was my mom's. Well, she's precious. You're lucky. Thank you. So I actually got a job at the outlet mall. -So we'll be by here more often. -Congratulations. -Thank you. -I'll see you around then. [sighs] [Stacy chuckles] Thank you for helping with all this. My pleasure. I haven't had a chance to tell you how grateful I am. I know you guys have been going through a lot. How are you doing? I'm okay. We're still looking at options. God. God bless him, but Ben, he's already started a binder on adoption procedures. -Classic. -Yeah. Ben said you got a new place. Yes, I'm getting the keys tomorrow. Is this a real place or a fake place? I need to ask you a favor. And I really don't want to, but... I need your help. I... I need-- I need a little time to get a new place set up and get our stuff out of storage, and... And I wanna get it all set up before Birdy moves in. I don't want her seeing an empty apartment. And I'm not gonna ask Ben for money anymore. I'm not. But could she stay with you guys just... a little while longer? Yeah, she can stay with us for as long as you need her to. And you can too. No, I um... I need to get a new place and get the furniture, and set up the utilities, all that. -How long will you need? -Two weeks. Three weeks. Maybe four. Max. [scoffs] You know, when I first met you, I didn't like you. I thought you were a drain on Ben, and I thought you never understood or even appreciated everything he gave up to raise you. And I resented you for... how you took Birdy for granted. I did. And even though we weren't always, or indeed, ever, on the same page... I'm your family too. I know we shouldn't... have secrets between family, but... But I can also respect that sometimes, there has to be. So we can keep a few from Ben, but between you and I... let's not have any more bullshit. [sniffles] No more bullshit. [Stacy] You're doing it. Look at you go. I am going to be so late. Ben, did you see my keys? Oh, my goodness. French roast. -Bless you. -Is Beth up yet? Oh, I think she's moving into her place. Oh, well, does she need help getting her stuff out of storage? I'll drop Birdy off at school. You have a good day. [doorbell rings] [voicemail beeps] [Ben] Hey, Sam, I read over the contract and I'm just not comfortable signing it. I want you to send my Billie book to the printers, and I want it in stores ASAP. And if you can't do that, then I'm gonna have to find another publisher for the rest of the Oracle series. So let's talk. Beth? -Oh, hey. -Oh, my goodness. I was worried about you. You fell off the planet. Yeah, I was, like, going through a bunch of stuff, and sorry I just, like, stopped returning all of your calls. -Wait, do you work here? -Yeah, I'm a sales associate. Mm-hm. Oh. -Hey. -[Marcus] Hey, bae. -Ready for lunch? -Yes. Mwah. -This is my boyfriend, Marcus. -What's up? But how are you? Are you still doing, like, your MLM aromatherapy thing? Oh, you know what? We're gonna be late. We should go. It was great seeing you. Have a great day. [upbeat guitar picking playing] [upbeat music continues] -Here you go. Thank you. -Thank you. Um, I really like the book, but, like, I was just wondering, like, if there were more dragons in it. You didn't have to buy a copy, you know. I have plenty at home. I wanna support you. -What if she hates our new place? -She won't hate it. -I tried to cute it up. -It looks great. She's been with you guys for weeks. [sighs] I'm like some weird visiting auntie. What if she says, "I wanna go back to Ben's?" She probably thinks Stacy's her mommy now. Well, we have been trying very hard to brainwash her. [sighs] [Ben] What's wrong? I'm nervous. Why am I nervous to take her home? She's my child. Go on. -Do you think that she's ashamed of me? -No. I think she loves you.
