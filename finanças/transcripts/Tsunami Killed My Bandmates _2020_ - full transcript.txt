Trying to heal myself from the trauma that's extremely painful. This film is dedicated to the "Seventeen" family and all the victims of the Sunda Strait Tsunami Disaster 22 December 2018 DECEMBER 22, 2018 4 HOURS BEFORE THE TSUNAMI -What's wrong? -I swallowed some water.

Let's swim with me… HERMAN SEVENTEEN, GUITARIST MARCH 17, 1982 - DECEMBER 22, 2018 BANI SEVENTEEN, BASSIST MARCH 9, 1982 - DECEMBER 22, 2018 ANDI SEVENTEEN, DRUMMER AUGUST 8, 1982 - DECEMBER 22, 2018 DYLAN SAHARA, WIFE OF IFAN SEVENTEEN DECEMBER 23, 1992 - DECEMBER 22, 2018 OKI WIJAYA, SEVENTEEN ROAD MANAGER OCTOBER 15, 1982 - DECEMBER 22, 2018 UJANG RUKMANA RUSTAM, SEVENTEEN CREW BASS OCTOBER 23, 1978 - DECEMBER 22, 2018 JANUARY, 1999 YOGYAKARTA Try to double me And you will feel my loyalty Try to lie to me And you will understand The honesty of my heart Originally, Seventeen was formed by a group of high school friends. Herman, Andi, and I, who all met at a school event. As we were getting closer, one day, Resa came to play with us. Resa, the manager of Seventeen. At first, I was not appointed as a manager, but… as a spokesperson. I handled anything related to them. From that point… "Sa, please be our manager." Well then, that was the beginning. I started to help them. To help them… manage everything. It felt like we had a solid team, but was unannounced. One day, on January 17, 1999, at 17:00 in front of my house, I told them… "Let's make a professional band and name it 'Sweet Seventeen.'" I knew Seventeen because of our rivalry. A fair rivalry. Doni was the bassist for Syanas. I was a fan of his. I followed Doni around. At that time, I didn't have a home. I lived in my friends' houses. Doni then offered me to stay at his. I lived there. I crashed in his house. Back then, Seventeen frequently performed… Performing in a café was like… a 1 or 1,5-hour session, then session break, and continue. Seventeen frequently performed during session breaks. We often met this Doni… Doni Tato. Doni is Andi's older cousin. Andi the drummer. He suddenly offered himself. "If you guys perform, I will be the singer, tak rewangi." Tak rewangi means "Let me help." I think it was Andi's idea. "Just leave it to my man." "Doni knows how to sing." Then we had some jamming sessions and felt the chemistry between us. They really had fun when I saw Seventeen… performing in a café. These kids were having fun. That's why I decided to join them. The first album was released in 2003. The title was Bintang Terpilih. That's crazy. We always performed on the same stage. I started to get so competitive. If Seventeen created something, then Endank Soekamti must too. If Seventeen submitted a demo, then we must too. Soekamti performed in festivals, and Seventeen did the same. We kind of fought for stages. It's a fair competition. I found that their songs were interesting. When I listened to them… This is pop music… but… raw, edgy. And the vocal at that time… was not pop at all, as the timbre was different. I thought it was unique. Also, the notation. They had a unique notation. We can recognize Seventeen's music by their notation. No one else had it. They were in that kind of level. That was amazing. They used a lot of Major 7th chords. At that time, we were… Only my music was different, while Seventeen and other bands only brought pop genre. But Seventeen stood out more among others because they were geniuses in making songs. They can make their own genre, the Seventeen genre. Not every band can do that. Others must struggle… revise their songs before finding the notation that is unique to them, while Seventeen already had it. When their songs are played, we'd recognize them immediately. We finally had an idea. There was a song titled "Jibaku." It was made for a duet. Without further ado, I recommended, "Let's invite Arie Untung." Arie Untung then came to the studio to sing. Arie hasn't heard the song yet, but I asked him to sing. I gave him a little idea, and which part he had to sing. Finally, we did a promotion. A promotion for about three months or more. Seventeen then started to become known. The single was getting into charts on TV. Some were famous TV programs. That was a really cool thing. Then finally, we released the second album. But we were no longer under Universal. The second album was released under Bravo Musik. IT'S TIME TO PROVE IT TO HIM… WHEN YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART… PREP NIGHT… AND THE TIME HAS COME… NEXT MORNING… IT'S TIME TO PROVE LOVE! We were recording in Yogyakarta. Recording was done, everything was ready, but suddenly, there was force majeure, a big disaster in Yogyakarta which forced us to stop doing promotion. For almost two months, Seventeen only volunteered for the earthquake's victims. Logistics distribution. We absolutely forgot about music. Then intrigues, polemics, and problems arose. We had to let Doni go. At that time, I felt as if I was no longer… I was not supposed to be in the music industry. So, the only best choice was… I had to… leave Seventeen. And when you know I'm not the best for you Let me go Forget me And don't you ever have any doubt PAINTING THE DREAMS So, what I… When I joined Seventeen… around the middle of 2006, I was attending a college in Yogya. There was a band auditioning for a vocalist, so… that was the first time I knew that Seventeen had an audition. Back then, in Yogya, there was… a trend for painting jeans. So, I painted my jeans with a silhouette of Emily. It's a girl. Then I wore sneakers that I painted too. And a Rolling Stones t-shirt. It was special for a Seventeen audition. So, I just wanted to perform my best for Seventeen because I would do an audition. Okay, finally, I did the audition. Ifan's voice was the best in the audition. After a discussion, Ifan was chosen. Seventeen accepted me on November 6, 2006. I received a call in the afternoon. "Congratulations Fan, you've been chosen as Seventeen's vocalist." Oh, my God, that felt… That felt amazing. I was like, "What?" Just that, with Ifan joining us, we should start everything from scratch with a new vocalist. Dendi and I started to look for… new record label companies. Rejections were all we got every time. It was hard. Hard for… It was Seventeen's first crisis, and… Resa was still passionate in managing Seventeen to keep its existence in the music industry. We then got information about Danish from Ema. Fortunately, around 2007 or 2008… we met Seventeen's management that offered a demo of the band which previously worked under a big label. I saw that they had a new vocalist. And I thought that Ifan had selling points. He is unique. Therefore, we decided to work with them. That's how it started. We finally did a recording. The single Selalu Mengalah was chosen. Unexpectedly, because of management's hard work, Selalu Mengalah became a huge hit. We were optimistic that Selalu Mengalah would be successful. It just needed to be heard, and one of the things we did was we bought lots of prepaid phone numbers to request our own song on the radio. That way, people could listen to it. Actually, my first feeling when I knew that was the song I wrote, "Selalu Mengalah," was when I was queuing in a supermarket's cashier. I was queuing, and… "Hey, that's my song!" I mean, at that time, Seventeen wasn't even on TV. Seventeen wasn't on TV yet. So, people didn't know who I was and no one recognized me. It was only the song. But I was so nervous. Did people know that was me? That's how I felt. I was a bit embarrassed while waiting in line. "Maybe they knew?" I mean, my feelings were mixed between being too proud and too embarrassed. I really wanted to tell everybody at that time, "Hey, that's me singing," but it was too embarrassing. The more we performed, the more money we got. We earned money. We earned money… and then we could… afford to buy cell phones with cameras. I remember it clearly that time. That time… we were looking at Nidji members' phones. Nidji members' phones were using soft and colorful cases. We were looking at their phones like… "God, their phones are so cool." "Their phones are colorful." Then we nudge each other. We were like, "What phone is that?" "No idea." "So cool, right? So colorful, right?" "And the soft cases." "Yes, very cool." The others were like, "It's this series." We didn't know about it all. From that point, our financial condition changed. We were able to buy new phones and new houses. We were able to buy cars, all of us. Those were bought with the money we earned from Seventeen. Our parents weren't rich. They didn't have a lot of money for us to spend carelessly without being serious with our band, so Seventeen was originally formed… to support ourselves and our families in the future. And you can't judge a band just by listening to their album. You have to watch their live performance on stage. And when they performed on stage, I said, "This band surely is ready." What you see is all there is. There were tens of thousands of people watching. Maybe it was like ten thousand people. And they were singing together. Drowned by their performance. And then, it was decided that this band needs to be supported. This band has a massive number of fans and cannot be left unnoticed. When on stage, everyone was having fun. I performed on the same stage with them with Ifan as the vocalist. They had huge energy on stage. SEVENTEEN'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY CONCERT 9 FEBRUARY 2009 Seventeen's songs are good. I mean… They're catchy, but not two-bit. Their chord progression, their lyrics… They are classy. Both in Doni's era and in Ifan's era… I think their pop music quality in Indonesia was top-notch. Seventeen in my opinion… was a band with a strong character and uniqueness. Their songs, melodies, and lyrics were very touching. And Seventeen became one of the bands that made people love Indonesian songs more. Especially the pop genre. You can feel their passion in their songs. When they were invited to events or such, they really enjoyed them, not just because of some factors that they were told or because it was their job. They really did enjoy being on stage. It was when… Seventeen was on Music Everywhere which was… an experimental program since NET TV was just airing the Music Everywhere program which was a TV show that appreciated real music. It embraced skill, arrangement, ability, and so on. I remember that on some of their videos, they collaborated with other musicians. I could really see that Seventeen enjoyed their moments. It's true that Seventeen at the time… was very productive, that they were even frequently invited to music festivals. Because at that time… the Malay-pop genre was very popular, but they came up with pop-rock which was quite different. We were fully booked for shows. In a month, we can say that we only had three or four days off, if we were lucky. Continuing to the second album, thank god, Jaga Selalu Hatimu was also successful. The song "Jaga Selalu Hatimu" was written during a tour. I remember we were on tour in around 26 cities and we finished all in 45 days. The last stop was in West Java. We were all ready to go home. I was packing in my room, feeling exhausted. We hadn't gone home in 45 days, and were very tired. Suddenly, Herman sang… You always keep your heart When you're away from me Wait for me to come back I saw that Herman had teary eyes. He missed his child. You always keep your heart When you're away from me Wait for me to come back I love you always I love you until the end Close your eyes That was one thing that we have predicted. When Seventeen got famous, successful, they would have full schedules, radio interviews, promotions, roadshows, tours. We would have practice schedules. While on tour, we also had to make new songs, so… The point of success had actually become… a turning point. A change in Seventeen. Personal changes, actually. The feeling when we were recording Selalu Mengalah, the third album, was no longer felt in the fourth album. We were not that enthusiastic to make new songs. But the label company kept pushing us. We got stuck. We started acting up. We started to get easily irritable. Yes, our egos were rising. That was probably the trigger… that made Yudhi leave. I understand that position. We start as friends, then one day, we become professionals working together and we might have different opinions. Yudhi left in around 2012. Yudhi said… NO LONGER IN AGREEMENT, SEVENTEEN GUITARIST LEAVES …he actually just wanted to have some time off from Seventeen because he had some family issues that needed to be taken care of and some things he wanted to do that made him unable to keep up with future schedules. It stimulates us to create new ideas. So, what should we do? There were five of us, and now there are only four. The problems Seventeen faced at the time… pushed us… to change our strategy. From two guitarists, Herman and Yudhi, to just one. Ifan as vocalist, Andi as drummer, Bani as bassist, and Herman as guitarist. Therefore, we had to make a new music formula for Seventeen. MEASURING BALANCES So… since everything was new, we wanted to make new changes, new formulas. The interval from Jaga Selalu Hatimu to the album Dunia Yang Indah to Sang Juara… was three years. A three-year gap. We wanted to make a new formula, new music. In the fifth album… we had a difficult situation. There was a major label in Indonesia that wanted to sign us with an irresistible offer, and no extra requirements. Everything was fixed, but with one stake… that management will be handled by the label. A big dilemma. We were in a dilemma. There were only four of us. Yudhi had left, and if we had to lose another member… I thought… I mean, we believe that our fortune… is taken care of by God. So, surprisingly… Bani, Herman, Andi, and I decided to… refuse the contract. Let it go. Just let it go. We do feel there are more important things than that, which are brotherhood and friendship. Maybe that was the reason. The reason that… made us communicate better with each other. We became more mature. We became closer. Before, we never really cared about each other. After that, in the airport… we were waiting… we were waiting for each other. The four of us felt… the romanticism in the band… got stronger. Two ices. At that time, our schedule wasn't as full as before, so we had more time for family. And the cool thing was… when we weren't together, we actually… felt closer to each other. We called each other's phones. We asked each other, "How are you doing, man?" "Dude, what are you up to?" We missed each other. That was very heartwarming. So, during that time, we had more fun working. It was very exciting to work with them. It was like… we were a real family. We were very close. Everyone gave ideas. I knew that they were already well-known. That meant I had to offer different things. To offer them different materials. I was quite happy that it was successful. JULY, 2015 RECORDING THE SONG "KEMARIN" Yesterday, you were still here By chance, in 2015, I was… I worked with Seventeen to produce five of their songs. Including "Kemarin." Actually, "Kemarin" was… quite an old song. It was released in 2016. And the music video was made… in Korea, so we went there. A typical man from tropical countries freezes immediately upon arrival. I complained to Herman. I mean, in the beginning, I complained to him. "Herman, it's like a dead man's song." "I don't want to sing it." "This is a dead man's song." And he was like… He was giggling and said, "It is a dead man's song." I asked them, "Can we change the lyrics?" I mean, it's like a dead man's song. "Come on, Herman, can you change the lyrics?" He said, "No need, this is okay." At the time, "Kemarin" was chosen not solely by my own decision. There was a team to select one among the available songs. They're actually the remaining ones. That's all. We didn't think that the song was a prayer. Not at all. Prayer is prayer, and song is song. Alone here now Looking for you I don't know where May you rest in peace Forever So actually, at the end of 2018… around November, if I'm not mistaken, our members had a meeting because in January 2019… it would be Seventeen's 20th anniversary. So, one of the big things that we were planning to do was to hold a solo concert again in Tidore, North Maluku, which was Herman's hometown. But then, on the… on December 22… apparently… destiny had its own plan. 09:58 WESTERN INDONESIAN TIME, 22 DECEMBER 2018, SUNDA STRAIT YESTERDAY We're in a meeting to form a committee for swimming class. 4 HOURS BEFORE THE TSUNAMI Go on, move your legs. -What's wrong? -I swallowed some water. Try to hold your breath. Say something. Hello. Hi, Uncle. -For 15 minutes so he'll be independent. -Yes. Just let him go. Let's swim with me… Okay, we're done with the games. It was a fun way to connect with the families. -Right. To get closer. -In every activity… Yes. It's a rare moment for them. They leave early, come back late, and the kids are asleep… 09:17 PM WESTERN INDONESIAN TIME DECEMBER 22, 2018 Show them! Please give it up for Andi on the drums! The tsunami hit the Sunda Strait beaches, -leaving deep sorrow -God, forgive me. for Seventeen band vocalist Riefian Fajarsyah or Ifan. Ifan lost all his band members and his beloved wife, Dylan Sahara… …in Tanjung Lesung. The band members were declared missing after the tsunami hit Saturday night. The tsunami hit the stage… where we were performing. With you Alone here now Looking for you I don't know where We never realized… IFAN SEVENTEEN, VOCALIST TSUNAMI VICTIM …what happened at the time. When I went into the water, my first thought was, "Doomsday is coming." "Is it real or not?" Because who would've even thought that a tsunami would hit anyone during a concert? No one. No one ever thought that… a tsunami would hit when we were performing. No one. We didn't think about anything. We were enjoying the moment. We thought everything would be all right. We never thought that would happen. We were just enjoying the moment. I saw Krakatau behind us. I saw some lava. Resa, the manager, saw it too. But my thoughts were, "Is this normal?" DECEMBER 2018, SUNDA STRAIT ANAK KRAKATAU ERUPTION "There was no warning." "It might be normal, common." So, I just let it slide. "Let's go for a sound check," I said. It was afternoon, if I'm not mistaken. We performed in the evening, so we did it in the afternoon. On the seashore. Over there, it seems like… the sky is dark. We're in Tanjung Lesung! DEWI SARTIKA, ANDI SEVENTEEN'S WIFE TSUNAMI VICTIM When the tsunami hit, the hotel room was flooded. "God, what is this?" I could only pray, and didn't know that it was a tsunami. The room was chaotic, and I said, "Let's go out." I was… Oh, my god. I was… HOTEL ROOM (4 HOURS) AFTER TSUNAMI I was planning to go to the venue. But when I went out… it was crowded, dark… I thought, "This is really bad." That night was terrifying. I will never forget it. People said the tsunami wasn't big. I was there, in FOH. I could clearly see the water. People just saw the stage, while I saw the water above the rigging we set up. The height was approximately 12 meters. It was I who set up the stage. With Oki, the late Oki. People said it was this height. It wasn't that high. I don't care what they said! I was angry. If it was a small one, my friends wouldn't be dead. JAROT NUGROHO, SEVENTEEN CREW TSUNAMI VICTIM ZAKARIA, SEVENTEEN ADDITIONAL KEYBOARD TSUNAMI VICTIM Hold on. When I was finally engulfed by the water… …I collided with other people, equipment, everything. It was like I was in a blender. Twisted around. I couldn't stop praying, and didn't think of anything else. I kept praying while drowning. After I realized that it was water, I thought, "I should go to the surface and take a breath." "I'll die if I don't." It was chaotic, very chaotic. Everyone was in panic, they pulled each other. Everyone. I tried to hold onto anything I could grasp. I grasped people's heads, bodies, and other stuff. We said it in a harsh way. Anyone who surfaced will be grabbed by others. I saw Andi's bass drum. It was floating. I held onto it, so that I could breathe. I held onto it. But, I kept drowning. It turns out, my feet were entangled in cables. At that time, my hips were… My hips were wrapped in iron. So, I tried to remove it. I let it go, and I got to the surface. When the second wave hit, before I got a chance to think, it turned out there was a counter wave that pulled me into the sea. It pulled me back, and it was stronger. The wave gathered dozens of people into… the same location. In the middle of the sea. I wasn't ready. We were still figuring out what happened. Water got into my mouth, and I was strangled. Strangled by others from the back. All I thought about was Ujang. Ujang wouldn't survive this. He couldn't swim. I was always with Ujang during the last three months. THE LATE UJANG RUKMANA RUSTAM Oh, my God… At that time… Oh, my God. I really saw a lot of people begging for mercy, they were really screaming, and… Terrifying screams, asking for help. Moreover… a lot of people were praying and chanting, "God is the greatest!" I just surrendered myself to God, seeing all of that stuff. Maybe it was sakarat al-mawt. "On the brink of death." When I was drowning… I was devastated like… there was no hope. I didn't have the will to stay alive. Nothing came to mind. I just surrendered myself to God. I give up. I'm going to die. When I was drowning, I was like… Yesterday, the world looked so beautiful Today, Seventeen is officially 17 years old! And with you, I feel it all Through this black-and-white life With you With you SELALU MENGALAH, LELAKI HEBAT, JALAN TERBAIK, HAL TERNIDAH AWAKEN FROM THE DREAM TWO WEEKS AFTER THE TSUNAMI IFAN SEVENTEEN'S RESIDENCE After the funeral procession… After everything was finished… The next few months, we lost contact. We lost contact with Ifan. No news from him at all. Until one time… Until one time, Ifan contacted me again. -He called me. -Good day. Good day. Sa? Yes, Fan. Are you busy? No, I'm at home. Come here, please. -To your house? Okay. -Yeah. -It's so… -I'm on my way now. Yeah. It's so… It's so quiet here. Okay, I'll be there soon. Yes. Thank you, Sa. Okay. Good day. Good day. BANI SEVENTEEN'S FUNERAL YOGYAKARTA YUDHI RUS HARJANTO, SEVENTEEN EX-GUITARIST BANI SEVENTEEN'S COUSIN They're my family. Just take me… DONI SAPUTRO, SEVENTEEN EX-VOCALIST ANDI SEVENTEEN'S COUSIN …don't take Andi. His children are still young. ANDI SEVENTEEN'S FUNERAL YOGYAKARTA They still need… a father to protect them, to lean on. If we could swap places, I'm ready. JANUARY, 2019 IFAN SEVENTEEN'S RESIDENCE With all the news, we were still baffled. We couldn't think clearly about what happened. Even at home, we were still wondering, "What just happened yesterday?" "Is this real?" In a matter of seconds, we lost everything. Have some water, Ifan. It happened so fast. -I just… I couldn't take it. -Yes, that fast. I don't go to off-the-air shows that often, so, a meeting with Seventeen is a thing… I look forward to. Last time, -it was two weeks before the disaster. -Yes, two weeks before the disaster. I'm sure when we're all alone… When you guys are alone, it must be… "I accept the marriage to Dylan Sahara Putri, daughter of Supriyanto, with the said mahr, paid in full." -Legitimate? -Legitimate. Praise be to God. Dylan taught me how… to… love someone… in a very sincere way. Things I really miss from him are… his hugs… JULIANA MOECHTAR HERMAN SEVENTEEN'S WIFE …his nags, the warmth in the family. Now that I'm alone, I can't get it anymore. Bani's sincerity and honesty. CINDRI WAHYUNI BANI SEVENTEEN'S WIFE He never changed from the first time I knew him. Never at all. Bani was a good person. An honest person. Shy and playful. It was always the same. He had a big responsibility for his family. DEWI SARTIKA, ANDI SEVENTEEN'S WIFE TSUNAMI VICTIM Andi was a very funny person. The house feels empty without him. After he was gone, we realized… how thoughtful he was, how caring he was, and how he was very close to the kids. In the end, I wore shorts. Why? It turns out I only brought a pair of trousers. Good. Only a pair. Hello, we've arrived. We're going to have breakfast first. We're going to the airport in 20 minutes. So how is it? -Stay safe, Uncle. -Always. Is it a video? Hopefully, next year, with this promotion, our label, GP Records, can send us to perform umrah. -Yes. -Yes. It's a secret. What should we do now? Everyone is gone. There are so many questions coming to us, the management, especially from the media. "How will Seventeen be in the future?" Our answer is, "It depends on Ifan, whether he wants to sing again or not." I still can't make up my mind. I was devastated. I don't even know what else to do. I can't even tell… what we'll do with Seventeen… I don't know. RUNNING AWAY FROM THE RAIN One thing is for sure. Seventeen has become one big family. The members were not only bound professionally, but also, they had become a big family. Wives of the members, their children. The children and wives of the crew, production team, management. They had become a huge family and indirectly, had become our responsibility. OKI WIJAYA'S FUNERAL YOGYAKARTA Yesterday, I was contacted by Rizal. -Armada? -Yes. -Armada. -So… So, Armada made a song and it fits. Armada had been the closest band to Seventeen. Yeah. To show our respect to them, proceeds from the song will be dedicated to their heirs too. When are they planning to start recording? I want to go to Pontianak first. -And then… -To meet your mother? Is your mother here? -She's in Pontianak. -Pontianak. After that, I'll come back here. Then we can arrange the schedule. The schedule is for recording. Ibel called as well. -Is it Uli's song? -Yes, it is. I heard it once. -I have talked to Uli. -The project will probably be next month. Uli is still traumatized. As we move forward, we may find… the best formula. Maybe both projects will be… a new beginning, so we'll see after this. I was starting to get worn out as my arms raised above my head. Suddenly, I touched a box that was firmly closed. And then, I saw hope. It gave me strength. So, I swam to the surface. Suddenly, I was able to catch my breath. So, there were four people there already. When I returned home, without Dylan… it was quiet. Very quiet. And… That's why I printed these photos in large scale and in large numbers. This is one of them, there are few more. It's one of my ways to feel comfortable in my own home. I have never… I never tried to look for my wife because she was always there for me. And it brought me happiness. Now, it's the other way around. Whatever I do, I will never… find Dylan again. Oh, God. The only thing we could do was swim to the shore, so… we turned the box together and we swam straight to the shore. Finding the shore was hard because the waves were very strong. Besides, we were exhausted, our legs were cramped up, and we were fully clothed, wearing jeans and all that. In the end, the four of us drowned again, barfing, swallowing too much seawater. We were out of breath and losing strength. RECORDING SINGLE "DEMI TUHAN AKU IKHLAS" FT. ARMADA It's sad. Oh, God. Juliana Moechtar is continuing Herman Sikumbang's music career. She was reported to be very disappointed with Ifan, Seventeen's vocalist. APRIL, 2019 MAHAKARYA INC. OFFICE Listen, if you can't do your job… as a singer in the music industry with all the schedules actually shows that you're not ready yet. For casual singing, he might be able to. During the process… During his recovery period, singing wasn't a problem. But it will be different. Singing professionally and casually are two different things. So… Maybe… You still need more time to cool down. Right? I don't think I need a break. -I can do it. -Yeah, but… -It's just a process. -You're not mentally prepared. I actually don't want to talk about it now. That's okay. Come. Can you please go out for a second? Please. Yesterday, you were still here Let's get some fresh air. At the shelter… ANDI SEVENTEEN'S WIFE AND CHILDREN AT THE EVACUATION SHELTER …I just wished, prayed, and waited for Andi to pick us up. Until the next day, he didn't pick us up. ANDI SEVENTEEN'S FUNERAL YOGYAKARTA WINDU ANDI DARMAWAN BORN: 08-08-1982, DIED: 24-12-2018 "Uli," they said. "Herman is no longer with us." After I came back to my senses, I said, "No, you're kidding, right?" "It's true," they said. Soon, it was crowded. The whole family was there, and the house was cramped. The reporters were there too. I could only scream as hard as I could. HERMAN SEVENTEEN'S FUNERAL TIDORE, NORTH MALUKU I didn't want to sleep in our room. It's like… my heart felt broken. I see clothes, it brings back memories. Even going to the bathroom… "This is his toothbrush," something like that. "This is his towel." I still… AYAM BAKAR PENYET I'd like to order. -I'll have fried fish. -Sure. -You have iced sweet tea? -We only have lemonade. Okay, that's fine. Do you want some? -No, thank you. -No? Just one. Many people said that Seventeen should just quit. Their fate was sealed. Ifan also gets traumatized when listening to Seventeen's songs. I also know that every time Ifan listens to "Kemarin," it makes… his heart crumble. Sometimes, people… After the disaster, I don't know why… I mean, it happens a lot. People sing to "Kemarin" or they still want me to sing it. I have no idea… Maybe they just love the song, but… deep down… it hurts me a lot. It's really painful. THE REAL CONSCIOUSNESS One minute passed. Three minutes, five minutes passed. It was suddenly very quiet in the middle of the sea. There was no sound at all. When I looked around, corpses were everywhere. All of them. At first, we were relieved and confident that we could get to the shore… but it turns out, it was impossible to fight the strong waves. We were drifting around with the waves… We were controlled by the waves. If it drifted to the shore, then it did. Actually, the movement of our feet trying to swim around was actually us deceiving ourselves into thinking that we were close to shore when in fact it was still far away. MAY, 2019 MAHAKARYA INC. OFFICE I think… I need a break. Wait. The camera is on. Is it okay? It's okay. It's better to keep rolling. Well, I mean… I was forcing myself. Truly, and I feel it. I'm tired. Wait, you mean a break like completely stopping singing or temporarily cutting off the schedule? Actually, I don't know. Well… I want to start a sarong business. I met an old friend from Pontianak. He lives in Bandung, he has a hijab business, and… we were discussing. He knows fabrics well. Especially in Bandung. I want to start it and get the fabrics there. Then… I want to perform umrah before Eid Al-Fitr. After Eid, I'll go to Ponorogo to visit Dylan's grave. Although, actually I… Yesterday… I met Luki Govinda, and then… He's a close friend of David. I learned from Luki that David, during the night of the disaster, made a song for Seventeen. -Have you listened to the song? -Not yet. Maybe not. If that's… what you have decided, it's okay. At first, I wanted to say that I wanted to give the song to motivate, to support. But I think… he was in a hectic condition, and he still had mixed feelings. We didn't contact each other. No follow-ups. So, yeah… Nothing happened. There was really nobody who could save us. Except God the Almighty. In Islam, there is something called durood. So we did it, the four of us. We never stopped reciting it. While we cried. While we vomited. We almost fainted. Our legs cramped up. After the disaster… I had the intention to perform umrah for my mental recovery. I want to pray as much as possible. Ask for forgiveness. Be grateful. I want to pour out all my emotions. MAY, 2019 IFAN PERFORMS UMRAH I met Virgoun there accidentally. It was the first time I met him after the disaster, and it was pleasant. We shared stories and discussed because I was so lost. Actually, I felt like I didn't want to play in a band anymore. I no longer wanted to make music or sing. Until Virgoun told me, "You must come back and sing, my brother." "It doesn't matter if you do it solo or in a band, but you have to sing because you can't give up all the songs that you've written." "Think about the heirs." "Think of the children of the crew too." "That's why you have to keep singing." EID AL FITR 2019, PONOROGO, EAST JAVA DYLAN'S PARENTS' RESIDENCE He left before night fell. He asked me to take him. He never did that before. He touched my tummy and said, "Please take care of my children." I was expecting three months in. "Please take care of my children." "Stay healthy." "Don't scold our first child." Because sometimes, I scold her at home. BIBIT AGNI WIGATI BANI SEVENTEEN'S AUNT Just the way he was. He was humble. Like, after dinner, he did his own dishes. He did it immediately. And he wasn't a picky eater. Even my children said, "Bani is a celebrity, famous, and rich, but he's still the same." NANDA PUTRI ANDI SEVENTEEN'S SISTER Andi was very good… at reciting the Qur'an. He won a Qur'an recital competition in his hometown district, Pakualaman. When he was ten years old, he completed the Qur'an when he was still in elementary school. I still can't believe the disaster. I still can't believe it. I feel like they're still in Jakarta, I'm in Yogya, and we're just not seeing each other. I don't know how long it's going to be like this. Andi's wishes… because we planned to move to the Bekasi area, and the house was ready for us to live in… "When we live in Bekasi later… we'll make vlogs." Yes, she's daydreaming. Maybe God loved Andi more. Even though he said he wanted to raise our children… until they grow up, even until they grow old… And now I feel it. The feeling of losing a husband. He was the father of our children. It's not just losing a lover, a friend, but the father of my children. I love Daddy. HAFUZA, HERMAN SEVENTEEN'S SON HERMAN'S GRAVE, TIDORE Hello. Good day… Where are you, Sa? I'm in Ponorogo. Nothing. I just miss them all. I really miss them. I…. can't imagine… seeing… Dewi, Uli… Cindri, the wives of our members, celebrating Eid by themselves. It's sad. Yeah. Well, I mean usually on Eid, we call each other, right? Yeah. What should I do, Sa? I mean… I want… what they have made and what they have done to still be useful at the very least, and still support their children. That's what I want. Yes, I understand. Okay, then. Yes, well, I'm going… I'm going back to Jakarta early in the morning. Let's meet, okay? Yeah. I'll catch you later. Yes. Thanks, Sa. Please forgive all my misgivings. Good day to you. Seeing Seventeen as public figures at that time was beyond my expectation because… my expectation of a public figure was something like rock stars. But, all of those expectations were gone. Nobody's arrogant, I mean… they're friendly. Easygoing. Like a family. What could I say? Humble. I believe most people who know them would say so. Ever since we were still in Yogya, I've known them as humble guys. Even until the last time we met, I didn't see any kind of star syndrome from them. They shared the same kind of emotion. Facing ups and downs together. Last year, Bani was still here, washing dishes, eating suhoor together. Now that he's gone, I'm truly sad. There's his striped t-shirt. I wore it. I wore it, and my child asked, "What is it, Mom?" "I miss Bani," I said. When Andi was still in school… in his spare time, he joined our relatives in playing gigs at cafés. And my father asked him, "Do you want to study or play music? If you choose music, I'll buy you a drum set. And you'll stop going to school. If you choose to study, then focus on it." Fortunately, his body was found. We can… bury him properly. And we can visit his grave. ANDI SEVENTEEN'S GRAVE YOGYAKARTA Cheesy. Herman was… I think he was a quiet person, but… seeing from… what he had done for Seventeen, he really was a great songwriter. Most of Seventeen's songs were written by Herman. And I think… I saw Herman as a romanticist and a mysterious guy. He rarely talked. He could make songs quickly and created good tunes in his own style. He had compassion. When Mt. Merapi erupted, we held a charity in Yogya. All Seventeen members donated their stuff. Herman donated his first guitar. His very first guitar from their first recording was donated. Herman said, "I'll get a new one someday." "It's okay, I'll buy a new one." And… the last time he went to the room, he asked, "Are you really not coming?" I said, "No, honey." He said, "All right, then." And I still remember his last gaze from the door. I didn't take him downstairs. He opened the door while looking back. "An, I'm leaving." "Yes, be careful." Then he closed the door. It's still deeply etched in my mind, his stare when he closed the door. While smiling. I can't get it off my mind. -You said you wanted to use the soft case. -This is the soft case. Ujang, Bendot. What are you doing? Unloading stuff. DEWI PUSPITASARI UJANG SEVENTEEN'S WIFE His unfulfilled wish until now was to send his parents to perform umrah. I cry every time I see his picture. I cried so hard. He said he was going to visit, have a cup of coffee, and grill some fish. Now we can't do it anymore. I miss him so bad. I rarely meet him, and when we met… I have to take him to his grave. He ordered something. Two big boxes… of toys for his child… who was having a birthday on December 9th. He was unable to buy it on that date. He bought them without me knowing. He didn't say anything. I was surprised because he never bought that big and that many toys and I was surprised. Are those the last gifts from him? Why so many? About five to ten minutes after the boxes arrived, my parents-in-law called me… saying that they found Ujang. "They found him." Then I asked, "What do you mean?" "They found him. Be strong." Oh, God, he really left me. -What's this rod for? -For fishing, not for you. Let me just throw this away. Oki was… He was like… As a roadie… Among… other roadies I know, he was the most… caring toward the production crew, and also the members. We were late on stage because we were watching Mahabharata. That was Oki. Don't want to miss the bus again? What are you going to take? NOVA YANTI OKI SEVENTEEN'S WIFE One month… One month before, usually before he went to work, he kissed my forehead or my hand. OKI WIJAYA, BORN: 15 OCTOBER 1982, DIED: 23 DECEMBER 2018 One month before the disaster, he always kissed me. Every time he leaves for work. And that was in public places, which he didn't usually do. -Let's go to the beach! -Let's go to the beach! I was in the sea for hours. In the sea, without any help… because our position was hard to reach. In the middle of the sea, where we only saw the sky… and the sea. The four of us were holding onto a box with lots of bodies around us. Until we saw a spark of light. And it was a security guard on the shore, but it was… far away. So far away. The land was very far. Apparently, we were swept so far away. HARMONY I heard the news in the United States. I was in Los Angeles and it became viral, even in the US. The people I met in the elevator, the receptionist. Since they knew I was from Indonesia, they asked about it, and they saw the video. And it was very sad because we had a relationship with Seventeen for quite a while. We also used Seventeen's song as a theme song for a Ramadan program. I was also in a band and under the same management, Mahakarya. If you asked about what kind of relationship we had, it can't be explained easily. We worked together in many ways and for a long time. So, that tragedy was shocking. The first one I remember was Dendi. He's the first one. JUNE, 2019 (6 MONTHS AFTER THE TSUNAMI) IFAN'S TRIP FROM PONOROGO TO JAKARTA Now, I'm more… I pray to meet my husband. I pray… I hope to die peacefully. I pray that… may he be released from all the torment. After that, thank God, everything went smoothly. At that time, I was able to let him go. I've seen his figure. I've seen his body, and the funeral went smoothly. I was at ease after that. God willing, he died in peace. Maybe this is… the best for us. That was his fate. God willing, we can accept this. We accept it for God. We tried to use the waves to get closer to the shore. From reef to reef. Then, we reached the shore and three security guards helped us. They were the ones who were holding the flashlight. After around… three months, suddenly, at dawn… Ifan called me at 3:00 a.m. Then I said… actually, I made a song when it happened. It was hard because I didn't want it to remind him of his grief. I just want him to be optimistic when he hears it. I wish the song could bring good things that would motivate him.
