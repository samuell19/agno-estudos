[♪♪♪] [SQUEAKING AND GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [GALLOPING SOUND] He's got galloping hoofs to the heart. My goodness, hoof and heart disease. That means he's nearing the finish line. They're going around the first turn, Shemp is in lead by a-- Unh! Come on. He's dying, you're telling jokes. We should take his temperature. If we only had a thermometer. Wait. Here's a thermometer. Good. Open your mouth, Shemp. No, I don't like pills. Give. [SQUEAK] Ow! Now you go on, heat him a hot water bag. Heat a hot water bag? Ten degrees below zero. Hey, it can't be. And what do you think you're doing? What? You told me. I'm heating the hot water bottle. Oh, I see. Ooh! Get out of here, you. [LARRY GRUNTS] You idiot, you made him swallow the thermometer. Now rub his stomach. Maybe he'll regurgitate the broken glass. [GLASS CRUNCHES] [GLASS CRUNCHES] It's no use, he's full of glass. Gather close, fellas. I'm gonna kick the bucket. Oh, no. I'm going, boys. Now you behave. If you don't, I'll come back and haunt you. [SQUEAKING AND GRUNTING] [BARKING] He sunk. He's gone to the dogs. [BOTH CRYING] Poor Shemp. [SOBBING] Poor Shemp. [BOTH CRYING] Poor Shemp. [BOTH CRYING] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yes. Yes. Oh, yes, yes. Shemp is not? Oh, Shemp is? Oh. Miss Jones, bring in the earthly report of my nephew, Mr. Shemp. Shemp, there seems to be some mix up regarding your eligibility to enter these portals. But Uncle Mortimer, I... Is this what you want, sir? Thank you. Heep! Eep! Eep! [SQUEAKING] Shemp! I hope you brought your asbestos suit with you. Asbestos suit? Gosh, no, I wouldn't need it up here, I... But your report shows that you and your cousins, Moe and Larry have been pretty bad boys. Oh. Oh, well. All right. Give me a pitchfork and a red union suit and I'll go. Fret not, my friend. We will supply you with everything. Come along with me. Not so fast with your devilish wiles. I haven't released Shemp yet. Thanks, Uncle Mortimer. Shemp, I will give you one chance to save yourself from our archenemy. You will go back to Earth and reform Moe and Larry And if you do, you can come back here for good. If not-- Wait, wait. I'll succeed, I'll reform that Moe and Larry if it kills me. What am I saying? I'm already dead. [CHUCKLES] You realize that they will not be able to hear you or see you. They won't hear or see me, eh? That's great, just perfect. Ha, not so perfect. For I have Moe and Larry under my evil influence. And I'll thwart you. [LAUGHS] [♪♪♪] Hello, big boy. My name is Helen. Helen what? Helen Blazes. Oh, charmed to know you. Why don't you come down and see us sometime? We have some real hot dances. Dance? Mm-hm. [♪♪♪] What am I doing? Beat it, you devils. Go to blazes. They nearly got me but I'm okay now, and I'll reform that Moe and Larry. Good. MAN: Board! All aboard! [HORN HONKS] Express, leaving from Cloud 49. Bound for the Big Dipper, Mars, Venus, the Earth and Cucamonga. Board! [HORN HONKS] You'd better hurry if you wanna catch that train. I'll catch that train, but I gotta do something here first. You see that? Ah. Goodbye. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Listen, you old rain cloud, why don't you look where you're going? I had the right of way. [THUNDER RUMBLES] What's the idea? You think you're in California? Gee whiz. [WOLF WHISTLE] [WOLF WHISTLE] Whoo, whoo, whoo! [YELLING] Cut it out, Uncle Mortimer! MAN: Board! Wait for me! [MOE & LARRY SOBBING] "Et cetera, et cetera. "And furthermore, "Where as I, Shemp the Stooge, "being of unsound mind, "do hereby prove it, "by leaving all my worldly possessions to my cousins Moe and Larry. Share and share alike." [BOTH CRYING] This is all of poor Shemp's worldly goods. A hundred and forty dollars. To be divided equally between you. Poor Shemp. He left us all his money. BOTH: Money? [MOE MUTTERING] Oof! It's a good thing you hit me with money or I'd resent that. Quiet. We gotta divide this dough up fair and square. Say, there seems to be some more in here. Wait a minute. [SNAP] Ooh! Oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow! Ow, ow! Oh. [LAUGHS] [SCREAMS] Laugh that off. [MUTTERING] [♪♪♪] A hundred and forty smackers. That makes 70 bucks for you, Larry. One, two, three, four. Robber. Say, tell me, how old you have to be to collect your old age pension? Sixty-five. Sixty-five? Sixty-six, 67, 68, 69, 70. There we are. Hey. Your pile is bigger than mine. Here's where I start reforming you, mister. Why don't you watch what you're doing? What are you talking about? You know what we're talking about. Yeah, you blew that money right off the desk. [GASPS] I'll divide it this time. That's better. I think you gypped me. Oh. You've been picking on that little guy long enough. It's about time you get a dose of your own medicine. Oh, wise guy, huh? I didn't do nothing! Why, you, I'll... [GROANING] Moe, wait. I'll mash you. Hey, that's enough of this nonsense. Pay me my fee. I've got a luncheon date. Oh, yes, your fee. How much is it? A hundred and fifty dollars. Why, Shemp only left us a hundred and forty. I'll take it. Are you sure this is all you've got? That's the last red cent, Mr. Fleecem. See? [LAUGHS] Any other lawyer would have taken the case for $20. Oh, is that so? [LAUGHS] That's what I call easy pickings. Are you telling me. [LAUGHS] Well, be seeing you later, chumps. Don't stay in the office too long. Dirty crook. You mind if we breathe? Dirty crook. Well, that did it. We're flat broke. Got a dime for car fare? Say, I had some air mail stamps. Well, what do you know? I know you're trying to gyp me again. [GROANS] Moe, I wasn't trying to gyp you. I thought I had a couple of-- Moe. Yeah? You took my money, didn't you? Yeah, sure. My pocket was empty, wasn't it? Sure. Well, what's this? Hey, there's something funny going on around here. I got it. You know, Shemp said he was coming back to Earth to haunt us. Ah, let him come. I ain't afraid of that fathead. [GROANS] Moe, why did you hit me for? MOE: I didn't touch you. That was what I was afraid of. Shemp's here, it's him, his ghost just hit me. Oh, I ain't afraid of ghosts. Stand aside, I'll prove it. Keep your hands in your pockets. Shemp, if you're around here, give me a smash on the chin and convince me. [MOE GRUNTING] Oh. I'm convinced. Ha-ha! Well, things are looking up. [LAUGHS] Well, so far you boys have had easy pickings, eh, what? We certainly have. You know, we've made a small fortune thanks to you. I must admit that, uh, I did give you some devilish good ideas, eh? Sure thing. Now if we can only get the De Puysters to buy our phony fountain pen invention for $50,000 today, we'll be on easy street. LARRY: When the De Puysters see a pen that writes under whipped cream they'll will fall for it like the other suckers did. You know you've been very kind to us. Now what can we do for you? Oh, don't worry. When the time comes, I'll let you know. This guy must be in too high an income tax bracket. Well, uh, good day, gentlemen. Goodbye, Mr. Heller. Here's where I really start reforming you two. Well, a toast to easy money. Toodle-oo. Skip the gutter. Break a leg. [BOTH GRUNT] Hey, what's the big idea? You did it and you're asking me? Oof! I didn't do it. It was Shemp. He's come back to haunt us again. Shemp, if you're really here, give us a break, will you? Uh, but no tricks. Oh, no? [BOTH SCREAM] Shemp, where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are. [DOORBELL RINGS] Hey, that's the De Puysters. Get ready. I'll get the invention. Here is our invention. Well I'm dying to be the first one to see a fountain pen write under whipped cream. Indeed, so am I. Now you take the fountain pen and place it in here. And put the paper in thusly. And pour the cream overall. Now turn the motor on to low. LARRY: Low. MOE: It must turn slowly. otherwise, it would overflow. Now would you care to make out your check for 50,000 now or later? DE PUYSTER: Well, I-- Ah. [GASPS] [LAUGHS] This is preposterous. What next? A towel, I'd like to have a towel. Oh, my... [GROANS] [SHRIEKS] [MRS. DE PUYSTER GROANING] Well, that beats the devil. You and your invention. Now, you look-- [ALL SHOUTING] [SCREAMING] Uncle Mortimer, it's working out. I think they'll turn honest. Help, help! Oh! Help... Help me. I'm burning... I'm-- Aah! Oh, Moe! Oh! Wanna piece of pie? Moe, Larry! That guy's dreaming again. Why don't you-- Hey, Larry! He's been smoking in bed again. Get the water and the ax! Put me out! I'm burning up! You nitwit, you. Oh, oh, oh! You brainless idiot. Oh! Oh! Turn him around. Turn him around. MOE: That's it. Why, you nitwit. Get some more water! Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh! Okay, look out, I'll-- [CLANG] [GRUNTING] Ah. Ah. Oh... Ahh... What a dream. You know, fellas, I just dreamt we invented a fountain pen that writes under whipped cream. [LAUGHING] Under whip-- There's your whipped cream. And there's your fountain pen. Write yourself a letter. "Dear Uncle Mortimer..." [♪♪♪]
