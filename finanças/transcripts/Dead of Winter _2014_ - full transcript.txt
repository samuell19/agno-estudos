Really, 1:30. John, you need to check in with me. You break your parole and I don't want you going backwards. Call me. It's open. Hey. What are you doing here? Consider it an intervention. I've seen the show. Aren't there supposed to be friends? You don't have any. Nice. Dobson told me he's looking for a driver. I'm not workin' for Dobson. It'll get you out of here. Eat some real food and take a bath. You stink. That's a pretty good intervention. You gonna do this? How much? I told you how much. Just tell me again. 200 bucks. So I gotta drive, what, 16 hours round trip, all night, sit there all day? God, you know what that works out to, right? No, I don't, tell me. Come on, it's shit, man. Oh, okay. Cool, go back to bed. Hey, hey, I'll do it. I'll do it. Course you will, because you're smart as you are handsome and you know you have no options. Hand these out when they board. Seriously? Hey, I got you this gig 'cause of what happened. Yes. You get another DUI and I'm screwed. Not you. I hear you like being screwed. Happy trails. Fuck me. Jesus Christ. Hi. Hey. How's it goin'? Good. I'm Bradik. Hi. Do you do this a lot? Geocaching? - No. - No? Wow, you want some tips? I can give you some pointers. No. No? No. Wow, a virgin, right? This is it, huh? Yep. This looks great. It's my first time. I'm super pumped. Sorry, Simon Richards. I'm the head of the World Wildlife Forum. John Garber, I peaked in the 12th grade. Here, I'm really good at self-defense stuff. I could teach you some stuff if you want. You want me to, sure, let's do it. Here, throw a punch. Throw a punch. Ow, Jesus! Ow, no, in slow motion. Nobody fights in slow emotion. Sweetheart, sweetheart. Here, listen, if you go real time on me, trigger my shit, I go lights out, okay? I can teach you some if you want me to. I'm like big into this Steven Seagal kind of technique. Gotta grab this guy by the hair, right? Stick your fingers up his nostrils, right? And then while you're, while you've got the fingers in the nostrils. Don't forget the fingers in the nostrils. You just wanna, you wanna twist like that. Ponytail flying in the air, great. Who's your friend? I don't think we've been formally introduced. Rachel. - Rachel. - Rachel, Rachel. Hi, baby. Rachel and me, we're gonna be long-time friends. Hi, what's your name? - Hi. - How's it goin'? Y'know, it's very rude not to answer a person. Hey, Your Highness. Your chariot awaits. My chariot needs a makeover. Well, don't be like that now. Ladies. - Hi. - Hi. Ah, reunion, bringin' old friends together. I don't see any friends here. Wow. - Angry. - Very scary, ooh. I'll take a dump in his truck. Hey. So, what's the deal with this? Geocaching? It's like a treasure hunt, but you use, like, GPS and riddles to help find boxes hidden throughout the woods. First one who signs the log book out, wins. Wins what, a set of steak knives? $25,000. 25 grand for playing tag in the woods? Shit, man, I'm in. Sorry, it's by invitation only. Well, that is too bad because I would kick your ass. Honey, you need climbing skills, decoding Braille, Morse, ROT13, just sayin'. Well, I hope you use your super powers for good and not evil. The pirates always have more fun than the Navy. Oh, really? Welcome, big guy. Your bus stinks. Thanks. Excuse me. I think I hurt the bus driver's feelings. Hey, I'm surprised to see you here. I mean, I'm happy. I just haven't heard from you. I know, I'm sorry, I've just been... Lately. Who's your partner? Oh God, don't tell me it's him. He's the best navigator around. Best climber, too. Yeah, I know, but he's Robert. I can use the money, okay? So, I don't know what you're thinking, but four teams? I like those odds. I've shown you this five times. I know you've shown me this five times. Yeah, you're retarded. Okay, can you just, like, talk to me like a normal human being? So two loops? No, yeah. And then... Nope, it's fine, no, we're just gonna die. You're gonna kill us, it's fine. Yeah, this is gonna be fun. Ladies. Hey, it's me. Are we good? Alright. Fill it up. Here we are out with the future B-Dik, Bradik, you all know him. I don't need to have an introduction. Alright, let's meet some people on this wonderful trip that we got goin' on here. Let's start at the back. Alright. Alright, here we have a dumb haircut with a body attached to it. So what's your name? Simon. Simon. So, what's your strategy for today? Actually it's interesting, I just downloaded an app that does calculations and projections using the Vincenty method. I'm moving on from you because the audience is gonna shoot themselves in the face. Oh, and, oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. Alright, and oh, here we have Eve. Hey there, Eve. Turn around, sweetheart, come on. Come on, there you are. Now what does it feel like for you to be defeated in such a horrible way? Sorry, those are my questions for tomorrow. I'm gonna make you my bitch. Promise? 'Cause that sounds awesome. That really does, alright. Back to reading. Hey there. So in the 69 position, do you guys have to kind of like tap each other when you're tapping out? Is it like a UFC fight? I'm gonna fuckin' bitch slap you so hard. When you guys have sex, is it, do you have to come up for air a lot? Shut the fuck down. Sir, what is your strategy for tomorrow? Two-man team, both on the same page, and no one goes rogue. Leaving everyone behind. For some people teamwork is not having to take all the blame. Yeah, I don't even know what that means. English, Robbie. I mean, was that biblical? Because it sounded stupid. Stalin knew how to get people on the same page. He sat before his cabinet, got an underling to bring him a chicken. It was running around back and forth. He grabbed it by the neck, plucked it, live. When he was done, bloody feathers all around. The savage chicken wasn't running around any more. It stayed in his lap, quaking in terror. That's stupid, I hate you. That's how you control people. Is this it? That's what the map says. You drove all night? Yeah. You get us lost? No, this is right. Yeah, it says we self-start at 7 a.m. That's in 15 minutes. Oh, shit. Let's go. Hey, check it out. A Tarptent? Jerry-rigged it off a car. It'll tell us the exact location of every cache. That's fuckin' brilliant. I love you. For a sponsored event this isn't very organized. How's your ankle? It's good. Dude, like, my shoulder is sore. Eve. Sorry, gotta go talk strategy. No, no, it's fine. Go ahead, it's fine. What's the read? Okay, so we're at 537 at 13.997. Okay, good. Channeling energy through the parts of your body that touch each other that are touching the sky, also down to the earth below. This is where I pet the tiger, and the fish swim by you. It's like I'm in a river. Keep workin' on that tiger. One day you'll be a lion. Alright everyone, set your watches. 6:55 now. Okay, first riddle. "Alive without breath, as cold as death, "this tale ends with me belly up. "Run past me and then look up." Cold, I'm really cold. Really cold, like me? Stop it, no really, two seconds. Okay. Dead fish. Oh, you're so smart, baby. Hey, Vegas has got you at four to one. Bet the farm I'm a lock. Go get 'em. 20 seconds. Are those orthopedics? Youth and vigor have no match for age and treachery. You smell like a cheese danish. And three, two, one. Go, go, go! Babe, come on! Let's go! Shouldn't we be running? Come on! Babe, come on! You know, that's a dick move. You're tailgatin'. Read it. "A penance you'll pay for the acts of depravity, "no way to escape for I am the center of gravity." I dunno, here. V! We're close. "Frolicking about before the blast, "Bambi looks up and breathes her last." Who the fuck writes this shit? Deer stand. Today. Fuck you. V, V, V! Ooh, okay! Follow the track. What's it say? I don't know, it looks Native American. What tribe used to live in this area? Shoshone. Here, decipher codes. Let's go. Wait up! What's it say? Read it. Do you know the answer? Where are you going? Got it. We'll be there soon! Where are they going? It doesn't matter. This tells exactly where we want to go. Up or around? Up. Definitely, fuck. What's the terrain reading? 4th class, small holds. We should probably tie in. Stratus looks down and away. Over here it's angled up. Is that a Tarptent? No. Ow, geez! Those aren't allowed. Y'know I don't need a Tarptent to kick your ass. Bring it on. Is your cock ever soft? Only when it's in your mother. Okay, I'll swing on you Boris. Because of you fucking idiots I lost four of my sponsors. Let's go, we got shit to do. Pussy. Navigation was your one strength. Now you're just dead weight. I brought trail mix. Like you noticed. Ben? Stop, stop! What happened? Logger cable cut him down. Oh my God. - What the fuck? - Jesus. What the fuck happened? He had an accident. Is that my beer? Let's go, get us out of here. We're not goin' anywhere in the bus. It won't start. And look, there's no cell phone coverage, man. Did you check the plug? Try your cell. Ah, fuck. Hello, anyone? - Pull my finger. - Go away. Come on. Hey, what do you got for tools? Pull. Holy shit! What the fuck? Oh my God, that bus was such a piece of shit. Oh my God! Everyone okay? We need to get back. You wanna see if it still starts? How far to the nearest town? I dunno, 200 miles maybe. 226. Can I see the map please? What do you guys think? I dunno, walk four or five days maybe. Maybe a car will come by. Someone's gotta be at the last geocache. That's what it says. "We'll be with you at the end, 15 miles". Let's go, we've got a lot of ground to cover. I'll fuckin' follow this guy. We gotta be close. Here we go. "I stood strong before people came to my feet. "I stand yet, a broken Centurion, "guarding my progeny scattered to the wind." Well, that makes sense. Wait, what are the lines on the back there? Here, let's see. Clever, it's the image of a hieroglyph. It represents a waterfall in the clouds. There, where the water finds its way down the hill. It's rotted through. We gotta go, guys, the weather's coming. I don't know, guys, it seems kinda sketch. The bridge is fine. I used to hunt up here with my dad. Okay, maybe just go two at a time. Go ahead. Sure, everybody go. My turn. Yeah. Listen, okay Coyote Ugly? Women, children, men, then in-betweeners. Sh, Lindsay! Stay calm. Look at me, look at me! Alright, give me your hand. Give me your hand. Steady, steady. Slowly. I'm fine. Ow! Still waiting for your balls to drop, huh, little man? Listen, tit queen, okay? You might be the top with Red back there, but in our relationship, I do the fucking. Give me a fucking reason to kill you. Just fucking give it to me. Why don't you go fist yourself? Stay away from Rachel. Oh, I just wanna watch. I just wanna hear that. Alright, enough. What? You know, I've been meaning to ask you, what's with the Thompson class ring? It's where I went to school. Really? Yep. Well, that takes a helluva GPA to get into. Yeah, or a hell of an arm. So, how did you... End up driving a shitty tour bus? I said I went there. I didn't say I graduated. Oh, God, I'm sorry, I... It's fine. Hello? Okay, waterfall in the clouds. Now what? We think, we don't speak. Try it. No no no no no, you think. I'm freezing my ass off here. Hello? Hey, read it again. Oh, babe, I gotta make a doodie. Ew, baby. "I sit strong where poor people came to my feet. "I stand yet a broken Centurion "guarding my progeny scattered to the wind." What's all that progeny stuff? Progeny means that the seeds were scattered by the wind and created this forest. Oh yeah, I knew it was about trees and wind and stuff. Did you hear that? Hang on a second. Oh my God. Holy shit. Is it loaded? Whoa. No bullets. Let me see it. I'll hold on to it for now. Anything else? Yeah, "Abide by these words or in 90 seconds "screams will be heard." What? Aw, mommy. Hang on a second. "No sooner spoken than broken." I can't... Shit. Fuck. No, baby! We move now. What the hell is going on? Just keep moving. How much further to the place? Maybe a mile. Fuckin' voodoo shit, man. What did that clue say? Silence, Bradik. We go back to where we came in. Maybe someone saw the explosion. Yeah come on, let's try our luck on the road. I don't wanna see it anymore. We just left her there. Maybe Robert can give one of his eulogies. What? I'm sorry I didn't bring my English-Geotrash dictionary. Are you ready? Come on. Where's Ben? Listen, Bus Boy is right, okay? That guy is dirty. I'm telling you right now, okay. So what I say we do is we find him, we attack him, take his stupid hat. I could hear all of you over a mile away. I got separated after Lindsay was killed. I went back to the bridge. It was gone. What do you mean, gone? I don't know. I don't believe you. You'll find out. Fuck! This bridge was blown. How do we know you didn't do it? Why come back to warn you? We can't just stay out in the open here. She's right, we're exposed. Come on. Is there another way out? Alright, well, you know what? Let's take a look, alright? We got the gorge here, mountains here and here, lake here. Actually, I remember a cabin up here. It's off season, I dunno. Maybe someone will be there. Well, maybe they'll have supplies or, like, a satellite phone or something. Yeah. Okay, but wait, wait. See, you wanna go back in the direction where the lesbian just got torn apart - like a wishbone? - Her name is Lindsay. You dick. I'm just telling it like it is. Asshole. Easy, man. What if we found a way down the gorge? Follow the bank of the river? Too steep, we'll never make it. With no equipment we're as good as dead. So we run? We evade. Okay, this is not the game I signed up for, okay? We are the fucking game, asshole. Go, go, go, go, go! Johnny? Johnny! Marcus and Eve! Split up, okay? Meet at the hunter's cabin! Just fucking great. I get stuck with C minus T. Wait, wait, maybe we should wait here for help! Ben, can you tell Tits-on-a-Stick that we have to keep moving? We're all in this together. Together? What, you wanna sip some cocoa, huh? You wanna rent a rowboat, maybe roast some marshmallows? Listen, you're either helping me or you're in my way. Right now, you're in my way. His tactics, feels like he's ex-military. That's not military. How would you know? Because I did a tour. Well, whoever's behind this knows this is the only way out. I'm gonna get a higher vantage point, see if I can see the others. With Rachel they couldn't have gotten far. If they're still alive. What does this mean? So he knows the area, right? Yeah, he said he used to hunt up here with his dad. Yeah, hunt what? Maybe we're not the first. Maybe his dad's out there right now and he's leading us right to him. Oh, come on. No, no, isn't it odd? He's left alone with the bus and it fucking explodes? He supposedly knows the area. All I see is some jerk-off getting us into trouble. Have you noticed his tattoos under his collar line? Those are prison tats. What? See anything? No, I can't see 'em. Let's move. Do you think geocaching is any way to spend your golden years? It's a way to test oneself, to see what you're made of. What are you made of, Bradik? What does that mean? Well, adversity doesn't make the man. It reveals who we already are. I'm tired. We need to find a way to the cabin. Why? Do you need a puppet show, huh? Do I have to spell it out for you like an Etch-a-Sketch? It's cover. There'll be food, supplies there. Well, what kind of food? Oh, Peking duck with a three-bean salad. It's a prefix, three course, really nice. Try the rib eye, get it nice and medium rare. Oh, and the creme brûlée, it's a nice passion fruit. How the fuck should I know? Why are you so mean? Sweet, I got an idea. Come on. Look, we can avoid all that shit over there if we cut across the quarry over there. We'll be sitting ducks. Rachel, Rachel, come here. Do you wanna go that way, or do you wanna go that way? I don't wanna go either way. Okay, that's not an option, so... I just wanna go home. We all wanna go home, pretty little girl, okay. Listen to me. Do you wanna go the super hard climbing way, or you wanna go the super easy walking way? I wanna go the non-climbing way. Hallelujah. Okay. You comin' with? You guys, you're making a mistake. Great, that's great advice. Okay, well you stay right there and you tell me how it goes, okay? Come on. You've got blood on your face, you know? I mean I guess if you knew that you wouldn't be standing there like that. Ow, dick! Just fucking saying. Just saying it looks better when you have blood on your face. Not trying to be a compliment or an insult. Yeah, this is a good position here. I don't know, it looks pretty open. Are you kidding me? I could run that in under two minutes. Oh, really? Yeah, I used to run track. I find that hard to believe. Varsity. You should see my calves, they're huge. What, what about me? You'll be fine, too. What, what is that supposed to mean? Are you coming back? No. You guys see any tracks? I don't see anything. Is that hunters? No, a hunter's round would be more measured. Those are pretty fast. They came from that ridge. Are they with the other group? I don't know. How'd they get in front of us? Maybe they're already there. Look, I think we're being squeezed from both sides. Okay come on, let's go. Let's go. You okay? Yeah. Stay down. Bradik? Yes, Ben? Are you hurt? Uh-uh. Bradik? Yes, Ben? Back where you came, to me. Okay, thanks Ben. Alright, the shots came from around here, right? Shit. What, you're gonna throw a pebble? Just get ready to move. Fuck! Ow! You hit Bradik. Throw another one. Well, what the fuck's he doing there? Fuck, ah! Stupid motherfucker! Ben, sorry I called you old. I am old. Yeah, what the hell were you guys doing down there? He took a shortcut. Oh, it hurts. Just shut up. Fuck you, okay? Motherfucker hits me in the head with a rock and then tells me to shut up. Oh God, I hope you get stabbed in the heart. I wanna go home. We all do, come on. Gotta keep going. I miss pizza. I miss beautiful, naked women. - Shut up! - Big-breasted women. What is that? Hey, be careful, that could be a booby trap. It's a cairn. Originally used to mark Celtic grave sites. Pussies. Bradik! What is it? Bullets. "I mark you death, cold and bloodless, "in God's light." Geez, that's great, more great news. Gimme the bullets. Why do you get to hold the gun? 'Cause you know me. I don't know anyone. Well, you wanna give it to the ex-con? You didn't think we knew about that, did you? Why don't you pull down your collar and show those prison tats? Just fuck you, Marcus. Why didn't you say anything? Because it didn't come up, alright? See, I told you this guy was full of shit. How does a bus just explode? You know what Robert said to me when he died? He said, "Eve and Marcus." What the fuck did he mean by that? What the fuck do you mean by that? I went to prison, right? So I'm guilty. You're ex-military, you know what that means? It's a gateway drug for sociopaths. Give me the bullets! Get off! Dicks! Get off me. You okay? Fuck, I'm sorry, come on. You okay? Don't fucking touch me! I'm sorry. Where's Ben? Fuck, I don't know. Bad things happen when Ben's gone. Where is he? Come on, let's go. Do not give him the fucking bullets, alright? Where were you? I'm sorry! Oh, God! Hey, hey! Hey! Over here! Over here! Help us! No, don't! Are you kidding me? I will track you down and gut you like a pig! They're not coming back. Nice, Bradik. Me? Look at her frickin' face, she looks like fright night! Shut up! She'd scare a monster, for Christ sakes. And you led us to a dead end. Are you sure it's even out this way? Pretty sure, I don't know. You're pretty sure? Yes, I'm pretty fucking sure, alright? I don't know. I haven't been in this area since I was 12. Oh, so we're going on hunches now? We're gonna risk hypothermia 'cause Ex-Con has a notion? Got any better ideas? Yeah, don't follow you. Any-fucking-time, Marcus. Okay, okay, listen, listen, listen. Listen, stop. Stop. It's iced over there, we can walk across, come on. Dickweeds. Come on, let's go. Such a fucking ass. You idiot, you fucking idiot! Holy shit. That's not cabin, it's a mausoleum. Truce? Let's call it a cease fire. That was subtle. Thanks, I hope you like ghosts. What's taking so long? I know. Come on! Hey, basin's cleared. You okay up there? Yep, all clear. Alright, let's get everyone else. It's all clear. C'mon, let's go. Come on, Bradik. Okay. Just keep it small, alright. She needs heat, man. Yeah, well, we got enough wind to dissipate the smoke. Any bigger and we can be seen from a distance. It'll warm up. These things heat up pretty quick. Here honey, let's put this around you, keep you warm. Got some stuff to wipe off your face, too. You know, if we huddled together naked our bodies would probably warm faster. What? That's not me, that's science. I'm just, it's fact. Really? Hey, I found some vodka and beans. This stuff is good. Like, I don't even like vodka. What the hell is that? Shit! Get it! Hey, give me some. You know what, it's not that bad. Kinda what I imagine baby deer to taste like. You're a terrible cook. I'm sorry, next time I'll put some scallions in. Hey, who do you think we'd eat first if we had to? Bradik, big boy. Me? Yeah, I'd eat you. Wow, I'm honored. I mean you get the, you know, the most cuts from the biggest cow, right? But you know where I imagine myself? I imagine myself like Kobe beef. Like, I'm kinda just sittin' there, people massaging me, you know? It's like an experience, it's not just a meal. Wow, you really thought that through, didn't you? You've never thought about this? Oh my God. Want some? I can't smell anything. You'll be smelling something later, after this rat, I'm not kidding. It's gonna be bad. Mmm, you guys do not know what you're missing. Well, there's an organ. You are disgusting. You are so disgusting. Thanksgiving dinner here, people. You know what, guys? We should really get some shut-eye. Yeah, we'll sleep in shifts. Someone will keep watch. I'll take the first. Good night. Hey, does my breath smell like rat? Really, get out of my face. What, I need to know! Really. Bradik! I feel a lot of tension coming from this side of the room. Go eat it in the other room. It's so gross! C'mon, I cooked it, I'll eat it wherever I want. You know what I'm saying? Can't sleep? Nah. Mind if I sit down? Sure. How's your nose? It's okay, but if I get a bump there I might have to kill you. You promise? Sorry about that. It's okay. Why didn't you say anything about prison? I don't know. You wanna talk about it? I got into it with some guy. It was in a bar. It always happens in a bar, doesn't it? Fight broke out, guy clocked me. I hit him back, I hit him hard. Holy shit, did I punch him. How long ago? I've been out for a year. Let me see it. What does it mean? It means sometimes you have to pick a side. Right. Shift change, huh? Goodnight, John. Yep. Crazy night, huh? Yeah. Makes you think. Think about what? What's important. Um, look. I don't know how this is gonna end. Don't say that. I don't wanna die without telling you how much I care about you. I care about you, too, Marcus. I thought we connected that night. We lost someone that we both loved. I don't know what I would have done without you. I thank God you were there. I was grieving, we were grieving. Anyway, it was hard losing him that way. I just... Rachel, are you okay? Rachel? Rachel! Rachel! Come on! We need light, let's go! She's not breathing! Her airway's blocked. She's not breathing. I need a knife and I need you to go in my bag, take apart the pen. Hurry up, go now! Hold her down, Marcus. I got it, I got it. Hold her still. Okay, ready? One, two. Shit, there's no obstruction. I need a pen, hurry up! Thank God, she's breathing. Okay, you can't move, okay? Do you understand me? Don't move. You were choking. We had to go into your throat. Do you understand? Okay. You're gonna be okay. You'll be okay, okay? Here, I need for you to hold this, just for a second until it holds itself into place, okay? You're doing fine, you're gonna be great. She's in anaphylactic shock. Her throat was swollen shut. What could have caused that? Granola bars. Honey, are you allergic to nuts? Blink once for yes or two for no. Did you get them here? So it's poisoned, no? This box is clean. So? So everything else in this place is covered with dust except this. How'd they know she'd eat that? Oh come on, look at her. She's the poster child for eating disorders. That could've been any one of us! So you're saying every move we make, is planned from the beginning? Think of the choices you have made. Could you have made other ones? Not if we wanted to live. We're being hunted. No, we're being herded. This is worse than Scofield, man. Scofield was an accident. This is by design. What was Scofield? I'm gonna go heat up some water. Marcus, what was Scofield? What the fuck? It's gonna be okay, I promise. Scofield, you wanna tell me about Scofield? We were at a geocaching event there two years ago. Who's we? Marcus, Bradik, Robert, me, and Jeremy. Jeremy, who is Jeremy? Why isn't he on this trip? Jeremy was my... He had a climbing accident. His line got tangled, snapped in the belay. You guys were close? We were all close. Was Rachel there? No, we just met her this trip. What about Ben, Lindsay, Simon? Were they there? Dunno, why? Just trying to put it together. Fire! Come on, go get Marcus! Come on, let's get Rachel! Stay low, stay low! Marcus! Come on! Get her out of here. Rachel, Rachel! Bradik! No! Get away from...! What happened? They took her. Bradik, go! Come on! Eve! Eve! Eve! No, get away! Eve! Eve! Where the fuck is she? - I don't know! - Where is she? I don't know, she was taken! Eve! Eve! Guys! Fuck. Guys, footprints. That way, come on. What are we looking for? We're looking for our instructions. Oh, man. "Your requiem awaits you as you pass "through the door. "You'll have your last judgment, "I am number four." The Four Horsemen. Pestilence, war, famine. Death. Great. Okay. Well, there's our door. Yep. Hey, you guys wait here. John? What is it? It's our marching orders. It's a compass. What language is that? It's English. "O Death, where is your victory? "O Death, where is your sting?" That's Corinthians. How do you know that? It's backwards. I'm dyslexic. Let me see. Like there's a gap. Right there, 12 degrees north-northeast. Right there. You know it's a trap, right? Yeah, it's been a trap since the bus blew up. But that's where Eve's gonna be. Let's go. We're expected. We can't just walk into the trap. What are you saying, Marcus? I'm saying it's suicide. What about Eve? Eve's dead, you know it and I know it. Look, I'm sorry, but you're not thinking clearly. How do you know she's dead, Marcus? Because that's their game. Look, I loved her, but if we keep going, we're gonna die, too. She's not dead, Marcus. How do you know? She was taken, okay, she wasn't killed. They want us to come. We take this all the way. He's right. Oh God, fuck you, Bradik. Yeah, I'm done. Wait! We've been friends for a long time, man. Everything that happened to us. And I don't sleep too well anymore, how 'bout you? We have to do this. This is reality, Bradik. It's not a fucking video game. If we keep going, we will die. You wanna leave her there to die? How are you gonna sleep with yourself after that, man? I'll sleep just fine. Look at me. Look at me. Give him the gun. Give him the fucking gun, Marcus. Let's go. See ya. What do you think? I'm thinking it looks like a place you go into and you don't come out of. You got balls, Bradik. Thanks. Please. Look, just let me go, alright? I walk out the door, you never see me again. I don't know anything, alright. Just let me, please. Just talk to me. What do you want? Talk to me! So. What's the plan? Last man back buys the beer. Let's call it a tequila run. I've come to take them back. Blanks. Pathetic. Join us. Now. What's this all about, Ben? Don't fuck with me. Hands behind your back. Face there. Here, Bradik, cuff him. Look the other way. Slowly. Sit. Hands. Sit. You never said anything about murder. Things have escalated. They escalated when you started killing people. It's my ant farm and I'll shake it when I see fit. And the Kevlar? You didn't tell me it wouldn't stop an arrow. The arrow collapsed your lung. That's why your skin is blue. Cyanosis. At the end of the game, the king and pawn go back into the same box. The accent starts to grate. What do you want from us? We're gonna talk about my son, Jeremy. The boy you left on a mountain to die. This is a trial? I think we're more in the discovery phase. Why don't you just kill us? There's no sport in that. This was a tribute to the game my son loved. I gave you a chance, a way to distinguish yourselves. But sadly, you revealed weakness and a lack of character. It was a dangerous race. Jeremy knew the risks. What about the others? They weren't even with us. Simon, piece of shit that he was, created Jeremy's fund. It was his own personal ATM machine. Lindsay, search and rescue. She didn't even leave the truck. He was dead. He was not dead! Get in the chair. In the chair! And Rachel? Sometimes a little fish gets caught in the net. You stupid fucking idiot. Something happened to his braking device and he dropped. All we had left were bad choices. There was weather coming. We pulled Eve out. And Jeremy? I'm so sorry. Apology not accepted. God damn it, man! Down on your knees. Down! You're crazy. For two long days, he crawled down Jagged Rock breaking his bones. When he hit the ground, he crawled for a quarter of a mile on one arm. And then the wolves got him. That rope, the one carrying my son, was cut clean with a knife. Maybe he cut it himself, you don't... Fuck you! You fucking maniac! You want a more measured response to the murder of my son? What is it, huh? An eye for an eye, so the whole world goes blind? I'm taking more than eyes. I was with Jeremy for two years, and he told me stories about his mother, his grandfather, even his pet turtle, and he never mentioned you once! You're no avenging angel. What was he like, my son? He was kind. And funny and a terrible singer. No! No, no! Marcus! Stop, Marcus! No! No! What are you doing? You know I cut the rope. I felt bad about it, but Jeremy got in our way. And then you go for this piece of shit! No! What about that night? What? It was one night. You loved me, I saw it in your eyes! Why are you doing this to me? Let's try it again, okay? We'll try it again. It's too late. What? I'm sorry. Fuck! You fucking bastard! No! Fuck you! What do we do now? We stay alive.
