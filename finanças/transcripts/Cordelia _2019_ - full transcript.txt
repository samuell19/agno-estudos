Hi, sorry, would you like to sit down? Oh, thank you, thank you. You'll feel the pole right beside you. Oh, yes, cheers. Sorry. That dream again. - Did I yell out? - Yeah. - Sorry. - No, I'm just glad you got some sleep. Yeah. Shall I open the curtains? - What time is it? - 8:15. Is it? Such a deep sleep. Dream is so real. I'll run you a bath. Thanks. He's gone. That fucking cello. Doesn't that drive you mad? I love the rhythm. So does Hunter. - What time are you back? - About six? You're alright with it? The play? - I'll be fine. Don't worry. - Good. See you. Hunter. Come here. Hunter. Stupid cat. Allain... Cordelia. Okay. Well, um, I'm just going to keep talking on the off chance that you pick up. Um, I'm on my way to rehearsal and, um, well, I thought maybe we could talk on the break at lunch time. It'd be nice to catch up, maybe. Um, did Caroline tell you that I'm in theater? Anyway, um. Okay, bye. Oh, fuck, fuck. "Which of you shall we say doth love us most. That we, our largest bounty may extend where nature doth with merit challenge? Goneril, our eldest born speaks first." "Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter, dearer than eyesight space and liberty, beyond what can be valued rich or rare, no less than life..." Yeah, that's not his real hair, you know? - Maybe it's a weave. - You can't weave into that. What do you think? - About what? - Roger's rug! - Oh... - And another thing... ...where's that fucking publicity woman with my... Cordelia. Cordelia. I thought it was you. - It's me. Ignore the beard. - Stephen. I thought you'd gone to America. Yeah, I did. I've been back about a month. - How are you? - Yeah, good. I'm pretty... quite busy and in a rush. - Going... - I'll walk with you. - Okay. - If that's okay. Sure. You look good, different, but good. So do you, different. Are you working? Acting? Yeah, I'm, I'm in the theater at the moment, Donmar just as an understudy. Do you want to grab a coffee? Oh, I can't, Stephen. I'm sorry. Well, maybe another time. - Yeah. - I should grab your number. Yeah, um. Your number? It was, it was just by chance that we met. Yeah, you're probably right. I'm going to walk away. Cordelia, I can't imagine what it must have been like for you these last few years. You were the last person I saw before I got on that tube. Yeah, I know. - It was nice to see you. - It was nice to see you too. Hey. You must live here. It's quite unnerving. - Sorry, I'm being so rude. Um... - Oh, you're back. Matt, this is my sister, Cordelia. - I've heard a lot about you. - Have you? Stop staring at her. - Get a cold one from the fridge. - Right. Yes. You alright? - What did you tell him? - Not a lot. Just what happened to you. - Shouldn't have. - It's not a secret. You need to stop shutting people out. - I bumped into Stephen. - Stephen! Jesus Christ. - A blast from the past. - It was weird, seeing him. I just want to feel normal, no reminders. I was beginning to, you know, but... Now it's... I don't know. Stop it. It's all fine. So, what do you think? - What about? - Matt! - Nice - Nice? - What's nice mean? - Nice? - I'm going away for the weekend. - What? - When? - In the morning. Bruges. He just showed up with the tickets. - Don't go, please. - I'm back on Monday. Look, you've been doing so well lately. You'll be fine. Only because you've been here. Hunter. Cordelia. - Do you want a glass of wine? - Just a sec. Bruges. Oh, there you are, drink? No, I've got work to do. - Do you mind Matt having a smoke? - No. - We should make a move. - Yeah. Do you want to come with us? I mean, it's just drinks. - I'm sure they won't mind. - No, I've got work to do. - At what time are you going tomorrow? - Crack of dawn. We've got to get the train at 6:30. - You alright? - Yeah. I promise we won't be late. Have fun! - Hello. - I think I left my keys on the floor on the flat. You're alright to wait up for us? Do you have rehearsals tomorrow? No, I can let you in. I don't have to be there until 11:00. I'll be back before midnight. Promise. - I'll see you later. - Oh, thank you. Bye. You scared the shit out of me. There you go. There you go. Oh, God. Thank you so much. The door shut behind me. I found a mouse in my flat, so I was putting it outside. You didn't catch it, did you? They're vermin. You'll catch something from that. At least then we don't have rats. Hey, you know what they say. If you got mice, you got no rats. Oh, I see your sister is back, isn't she? - Yeah... - Tell me, how's your father? - Oh, um, he died, Mr. Moses. - Oh... No, no, no, some time ago. - Um, anyway, thank you for letting me in. - Yeah. Oh, uh, have they started the sewers? - I hate fucking rats. - I tell you, I do. I'm glad you found the mouse, no rats here then. That's alright. Thank you. Hello? Is anyone there? Stop calling this number. You were called today at 9:35 p.m., the caller withheld their number. Hello. Sorry, sorry, I got her home too late. We rang the landline. You were asleep? - No. - Why didn't you answer then? I'm going to bed. Yeah, I think, I think we are too. - Is she alright? - Yeah, no, she'll be fine. Just come on, come on, go on. I'll talk to her. - I'll be right back. - I'll put my pajamas on. Is there something wrong with you? The phone rang at least three times tonight. For fuck's sake, Cordelia, it was probably a sales call. They didn't say anything three times. You've got to stop this. You need to start living in a real world with other people in it. - Not this half existing. - Maybe I wasn't meant to exist. Maybe I was meant to fucking die. No, I'm not doing this. I'm not doing this. I'm going to go next door... Stop! What is this? "Look, I'm sorry about last night. We're off to Bruges with big hangovers. I hope you still aren't upset. Have a nice weekend without us, and we'll see you bright and early Monday morning. Remember how strong you are. Try not to dwell on things, my sweetheart. All my love, C and Matt." Is this chair free? Oh, yes, it is, please. Oh, did I make you jump? No, I was just reading, I was miles away. You live below me. - Yes, I hear you. - Oh, I'm sorry. There's nothing worse than hearing someone practice. No, I love it. It never bothers me. Well, if it does, just, uh, you know, get a broom, bang on the ceiling and I'll stop. Frank. My name is Frank Ryan. Cordelia Russell. It's funny because I hear you, but I've never actually seen you. My sister has. We are identical twins. - Only to look at. - Oh. That would account for it. Account for what? Well, I practice in the window and I, I've seen you lots of times, but obviously... it wasn't always you. No. Promise you'll bang on the ceiling if it drives you mad. I think it's really beautiful. Oh, sorry, do you mind if I get this? No. Hello. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, I'm just having a coffee with my neighbor. No. No, she seems very nice, and she isn't complaining about my playing. Yeah, I miss you. No, I think you'd really like it, and the area... I found this lovely little pub in a couple of mews about five minutes away. Yeah. Yeah, well, go to bed. I'll ring you when you wake up. All right. All right. All right. Bye. - Sorry, have you paid? - No. - This is su... - It's on me. It's on me. Watch Valerie for me, will you? I don't want her running off. - Where are you off to? - Um, we have a run-through at the theater. Oh, whereabouts? - Covent Garden. - Oh, it's the same as me. Oh. Tube? Tube. I'm not really so good on tubes. I'll look after you. - Why do you call her Valerie? - After my first love. - That's very romantic. - I wish it was, she drove me mad. I was besotted by her. She played the violin beautifully, my mom used to make me practice with her, but she was cruel and spiteful. You know, she came around our house, to tell me and my mom she had gotten into St. Mark's and I had failed. - So she didn't have your back? - No. No, she didn't. What happened to her? She married an accountant called Francis, she got three children and she regrets being horrible to me. - How do you know? - She told me. She came to a concert I was playing in Dublin. She came around afterwards to tell me how fantastic I was and how sorry she was for being such a shit at 11. I pretended I couldn't remember who she was. That's a bit cruel, Frank. Yeah, well, it was, but, you know... ...I thought I was a god. I was traveling all over the world doing concerts from New York to Moscow. I was a star. - What are you now? - I'm a humble musician earning a crust. It's our stop. Sort of lost, you know. You know, playing in an orchestra is one thing, but being a soloist is another. I would arrive in some beautiful city dribble into the hotel, practice, go to the concert hall, play with an orchestra I didn't know, be conducted by someone I didn't know, do the concert and I would go back to the hotel eat something, drink one wine, go to bed, wake up, go to the airport and head off to another city. You alright? Jeez, are you okay? Look at me, look at me, look at me, shh, shh, breathe, breathe, it's alright. It's okay. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Come here, you, bitch. Stop! Hi, you okay? You okay? - Yeah, is your... - cello okay? Oh, yeah, it is a flight case, it's meant to be chucked down the stairs. - Do you want to check it maybe? - Uh, I'll check it later. Let's, let's get out of here. Come on, okay? All right. I'm sorry. I'm feeling much better now. It's alright. It must have been the stairs. I just, um, it took my breath away. Sort of hyperventilating, I'm sorry. I thought I was quite fit. Oh, I almost killed your first love. - I'm sorry. - No, no, no, it should be fine. Yeah, she did good to fall down some stairs. She rules my life. Listen, I've to get a move on, but, um, - are you sure you're going to be okay? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. What time do you finish practicing? Uh, it's rehearsals. Uh. Five. It's Saturday. Five. Do you want to meet somewhere at six? I've only got to do the matinee, so we could, um, we could have a drink or something. Shall we do that? There's a bar on Frith Street called Vladimir's. Do you want to meet there? - Yeah. Okay. - All right. Have a good rehearsal. Yeah? So it looks like I'm playing Cordelia. I know, it's funny. And the actress who was playing Cordelia is now playing Regan, and the other actress who was playing Regan is now playing Goneril. Yeah, no, I am. And Christ, it's been ages since I've been in theater. And the Donmar... it's a really small space, but, you know, and the audience is quite close, I mean. I know that. Yes. I'm actually just about to go for a drink with Frank. The man from upstairs. Yeah, I met him today at the café, the Brunswick. Yeah, he's really nice and he's somewhere doing a matinee at the moment. He's good-looking. Caroline, you said you saw him. Well, you know what? He had to ask me on the Tube. Yes, I went on the Tube. Stop that. You found me, then. Yeah. What would you like? Um, tea, please. Have a glass of something, I can come and join you. The house white is not bad. Okay. Thank you. Everything all right? Oh, yeah. Thank you. It's fine now, childcare. You must be Frank's neighbor. I'm Natasha, he said you were coming in. I told her that you don't complain about the music. - Cordelia. - What would you like? - A glass of red? - That would be lovely. Thank you. - So, how was your rehearsals? - Hmm. It was okay. The American kicked off about the rest of the cast not giving Lear enough respect. Bet he just wants people to stand there and look at him while he talks. He sounds like a real pain. He is. He is quite old school. And the director is about 12, so he's scared shitless of me. What... What are you doing? - You look fantastic when you're angry. - Stop. Wait, let's do a selfie. - We look good together. - Frank! There's a call for you on the landline. Shit, uh, might be a minute. Hello, how are you? Hi, nice to see you again. Gin tonic? Hello? Cordelia, it's Frank. - It's so bad. You alright? - Yeah? - Um, Frank, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, yes, yes. - Can you meet me outside? - Yes. Sure, I can do that. At the back entrance... - And don't forget Valerie. - What's going... Okay. Don't forget Valerie, right? Okay. I'm so sorry about that. There is someone I didn't want to see, and see a friend gave me a warning call. Come on. Let's get a cab. - I'll give you a lift home. - It's okay, I can cope with the bus... No, you wouldn't, it's hell, honestly, and with this, it's even worse. Plus, I owe you an explanation. Come on, you'll be quite safe. Come on. Get in. Hunter Street, please. - Does that happen often? - What? You having to leave buildings through fire exits. So what did he want? The person you were trying to avoid. Money. That's why you're travelling in a taxi. Oh, have you got my phone? - Thanks. - Nice photos. What do you mean? You seem to have a lot of pictures of my sister and I on your phone. - Is that you? - That's my sister. - Christ. - Is that all you have say? Well, it's a new phone, isn't it? What does that mean? Well, I'm just... I don't know, I'm trying out the camera taking pictures out of the window. And this? It's my letterbox. Why? - Because I fancy you. - That's a bit weird. And who do you fancy, me or my sister? You, I fancy you. I didn't know there were two of you. I'll get this. Suppose me asking if you'd like a drink in my place is out of the question? Well? No, I need a little headspace. Can I give you some money for the taxi? I'll play something for you. - Hello? - Why did you close the curtains? Who is this? I can still just see you again now. Is he your new boyfriend? Is he playing for you? Are you okay? He keeps ringing me. I keep getting these calls. He keeps ringing. He just rang. He just rang and he's watching from outside. He just rang and, and, and said that you were my boyfriend and... that you were playing for me upstairs. How would he know I was playing for you? Because he must have seen us just come in. He's watching from outside. - I can go and have a look. - No, no, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, please. I know, look, come with me. Yeah, you can stand in my front room. Listen, you can stand in my front room. You can see the street and I can see you. Okay? Alright? Come on. Go, go, go. I'm going to have a look. You stay there. Oh, Mrs. Grotowski. Where is he? Oh, please, stop that. This noise goes on morning, noon and night. My husband, he's had a stroke, he can't sleep. There is now noise from dawn to dusk! Do we have to put up with this dreadful noise? It is making him depressed. How dare you! Mr. Ryan, how dare you... What did I do? It just started playing. Oh, it's so easy with the practice, it's a tool for musicians. It's like a mini recording device. Look, the only way of looking down into your flat is by stopping and peering down from the pavement. I think if that had happened, I'd have seen him because I was here, playing. So, whoever rang just guessed you were at the window. He knew I had closed the curtains. He said, "Why did you close the curtains?" I'll show you. I came in. And then I went into the front room. - I could hear you, up above. - What's out there? Nothing is. A few yards of wall that goes up to the pavement. - And around the back? - You're scaring me even more now. Nothing. Uh, just a yard and two bedrooms overlooking the yard. Why are you asking this? I'm just trying to see if there's a way to get out. What do you mean, "out"? Someone has been in my room. The doors have all been opened. Oh, what the fuck is going on? I'll get it. What did he say? Nothing. I could just hear breathing. It's okay. Whoa, Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Okay, breathe. Breathe. Okay. Look, look! Watch me. Yeah? Watch me. Problem solved! Now it can't ring anymore. - Shouldn't we call the police? - And say what? Y... you had a prank call? Look. Someone is trying to frighten you. Yeah? I'm here now. I'm right above you. I could help. I got a spare room. I need to sort it out a bit. - Are you in tonight? - Yes. I'll stay here. And i... if I need you, I'll shout. - Are you certain? - Yeah, a hundred percent. Alright. Hunter! Hunter? Hunter! Hunter. Hunter? You were called today at 9:15 p.m. The telephone number is 0-7-7-7-6-1-3... You were called today at 9:15 p.m. The telephone number is 0-7-7-7-8-2 1-3-6-0-4. You're back. I haven't seen you in ages. I wish you would talk to me. You've never talked to me. Hunter is dead. He was scared of you. I'm not. I'm glad you're back. I might be able to sleep now. I'm going to take a photograph of you. You never ring back. I guess you're asleep. I'm bringing Hunter home to bury him. I got the first train and then a cab from Littleport. I'll see you soon. Allain! Allain. - Hello? - I heard you come in. Yeah, just got in, I got absolutely soaked. Have you eaten? No, I was going to get my wet things off to try and get warm. I got a picnic I can bring down. Okay, just give me ten minutes to dry my hair. I'll come now. You dry your hair and I'll set out the picnic in the kitchen. - Okay. - Alright. Had a good day? Yeah. I went to visit my stepmother. What did you do? This and that. Oh. Got any lemons? No. I'll grab one from upstairs. Don't worry. I... I'll leave the door on the latch. Stupid fucking light. I told you to fix that. Stop! Weird color. No, it's nice. You look nice, you look nice. Nice. Hmm. Everything is fine. Where the fuck are you? Still raining. I nipped to the shops. You okay? You took forever. I was getting impatient. Well, I'm here now. I'll fix us a drink. Whiskey or wine? Trying to get me drunk? Are you safe, Frank? Am I safe with you? Am I safe with you? Your clothes are damp. I'm running a bath. So where did you study music, Frank? A long time ago, at the Royal College. I went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. I was a good actress, fucking good actress. I won the gold medal, so it's official. I was good. Then I got involved in real life drama and RADA seemed useless. I couldn't go underground. Into the Tube. I haven't in over 12 years. Until yesterday with you, Frank. And what's so strange, is that it all happened below here. Below this flat. Right below us, Frank. It was a Thursday morning, 8:49, Piccadilly Line, between Kings Cross and Russell Square. And I survived. Rats survive anything, isn't that what they say, Frank? Well, I survived the bomb on the Tube. So, what does that make me? How do I look? Do you like me dressed like this? The way you dress tells people something about you. I've forgotten that. I don't know who I am. I know that I want to fuck you, Frank. Just tell you that. You look good. Do you want to fuck me, Frank? It's our first date. Do you think we should fuck on the first date? We could fuck on the floor. Or in the bath. Or in Caroline's bed. I don't care. I just want you. You want me, Frank? What the fuck do you want from me, Frank? I want to feel you. I see you. I know you hide alone in that flat upstairs. Do you think of me? Yeah. Yeah, I do. You're just the same as me. Half-living. I like living alone. I need to trust you, Frank. What do you mean? I want you to play for me. Go and get your cello. Play for me. Do it. You didn't believe me. I can't play in front of people. It's hard for me, you're right. You don't just peep through windows do you, Frank? - Cordelia, you don't know wh... - You are really fucked up, Frank. You're the caller, aren't you? You're not just some... ...tragic musical talent with performance anxiety. It's not just that. You hide up there in your flat... ...watching us. I know what it is to be afraid. And to feel that nothing is safe. I gave my seat to someone else. I'm not meant to be in the world. The floorboards are up, Frank. You have been peering at us through the floorboards. What are you on about? You've been spying on us. I tore up the floor to catch the rat. What? They're everywhere, Cordelia. You brought the rats up from the underground with you. Just get out. I can see right through you. We're the same, you and me. Just like you said. Fuck you, Frank. You judge me. You're just as messed up, huh? You don't know anything about me. I played for you. I let you see me, really see me, and now I should get something in return, hmm? Or is it all games with you, Cordelia? You make me trust you and then you kick. I want you to leave. I preferred watching you, anyway. Just... please, leave. I wasn't buying this act for a second. You're tortured by guilt. Oh, my God! What have you done? Shouldn't have said that, Frank. Because I'm not guilty. It's not my fault that I'm here. Jesus! Fu... Fuck! Y... you stabbed me! I need... Cordelia, I need... I need... I need an ambulance. She... I... Fuck! I need... I need help, Cordelia. You do... you, you've stabbed me in the chest. I need to go to a hospital. Fuck, m... my cello. Cordelia, please, call 999! It's not working, Frank. Use your mobile! Hello! Cordelia Russell. 2 Asheville House, Hunter Street. I'm with someone who's been stabbed in the chest. Uh, on the right side. With a knife, I think. Yes, he's conscious. Um... ...not a lot. No. Yes, I can do that. Okay, and y... and you'll stay on the line? Okay. Thank you. They're on the way. I'm just going to get something to keep you warm. Stay there and keep going. Fuck! It's going to be okay. I'm going outside to wait for them. Thank you. You okay? I was born with my heart on the right. I stabbed you on your right side. We aren't the same. So, if we were really the same... ...you would die. That'll be them. It's not for us. I'll chase it up. I think this is yours. They said not to pull it out. You didn't call the emergency people, did you? They said not to pull it out. You didn't bring them! Look, I need your help. I need to get upstairs. Please, help. I'm losing a lot of blood. I'll say this happened on the street. Please, help me. Jesus fucking Christ, I need you to help me! I can't breathe properly and I'm bleeding to death. Where are you going? What are you doing? Help! I need to clean you up, Frank. You've been stabbed. I'll leave you here. I'll call Caroline. She'll know what to do. Why don't you call an ambulance? How can Caroline help? She's my sister, Frank. I need to talk this through with her. Hi. Sorry to bother you. Um... ...I know it's late. Maybe if you get this message, you could call me back. Apparently we have rats. Maybe I told you that already, though. I need to get rid of it. Anyway... ...I love you, sister. No, I'm... I'm fine. Just... being paranoid as usual. Edgy. Seeing things. No, it's in control now. Yeah. Frank. From upstairs. Yeah. I really liked him. It's funny, I... I feel sort of connected to him. It's weird. I feel quite calm. Caroline, don't do that. No. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm fine, I swear I'm fine. Have a nice day. And I'll see you when you get back. Okay. I love you. Bye. Frank. Frank. Frank. Frank? Frank. Frank? Frank?
