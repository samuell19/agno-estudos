Some of the words that people used to you was "mong", "idiotic", "horrible", "you're different" and "you're odd". Walking through the neighbourhood and he actually shout out, "Hey, I didn't know you was a retard." And start pelting orange behind me. I've been called "spacker", which isn't very nice at all. People used to tell me I'm not going to achieve. And they would call me like a spastic and everything like that, and I would always feel lonely. Once people know you have a disability, you become the lowest thing in society. They are the world's most innocent victims and they suffer only because they are different. The world said that people with intellectual problems should not be seen in public. Tonight, you are part of the year's largest sporting event in the world, in Washington. If you seek joy, come see the Special Olympians. She took people with intellectual disabilities and brought them out of institutions and gave them and their families hope. Eunice Kennedy Shriver is royalty, as far as I'm concerned. The days of separation and segregation are over. What nation you come from doesn't matter. We don't care. The plan was laid early in my mother's life, to be fierce, determined, to some extent angry. Your age, your size, we don't care. You'd see this great shock of hair, you know, and she would just stare at you, just stare a hole at you, and just was pushing her cause. Go home and tell your countrymen, "I am a champion athlete!" This is sport at its least cynical and this is pure unadulterated sport. 30 years ago, the world said, "You are unable to run 100 metres." Today, you run the marathon. I think, you know, she's one of the few people that changed the world. The Special Olympics World Games is one of the biggest sporting events on the planet. Every two years, thousands gather to compete. And almost every day, in almost every country, there's a Special Olympics event. Five million athletes with intellectual or learning disabilities are involved. But 50 years ago, these people were ignored and institutionalised. It took a woman from America's most powerful family to change that. A woman in a man's world. This is the story of how Eunice Kennedy Shriver, inspired by her sister's struggles, defying her powerful father, confronting prejudice and ignorance, used sport to change lives. That was our royal family. The Kennedys, that's exactly what they were. And I think it just had to do with this moneyed, beautiful, well-known... We just didn't have anybody like them. Eunice Kennedy was born in 1921, the fifth of nine children, arriving into a family whose fame was growing all the time. I think in the early part of the 20th century, a family of nine, growing up in Boston, with prominent parents, very competitive environment, challenged to do the best, to be at the front lines of everything. I think they grew up, you know, in a nice way, pretty competitive. Like, you can't beat me! And then, everybody had dinner and had a nice time. But it was clear, like, I'm the best tennis player. It's probably not healthy, particularly, mentally. Somebody watching this will say, "Hm, those people are psychotic." But that's the way we grew up and that's the way she grew up. She was a fighter from the get-go, fighting to be seen, fighting to be acknowledged, fighting for her space. But amongst the smiles and the sport, there was a secret. My mother's sister was intellectually disabled, Rosemary, but she could see that Rosemary could do a lot of things. I know that my mother and Rosemary were closest. They had a special bond. All of her brothers and sisters would have said that. Basic value of the Kennedy family on the lawns in the '20s and the '30s, you know, we're all in it together. We're a family. There are nine of us, so we have a special sister, she comes to all the events. She plays in all the sports. We don't treat her any different. They loved their sister, Rosemary, but they could see the world didn't love their sister. And it's in this Victorian workhouse atmosphere that some 2,000 people with damaged and inadequate brains work out their lives. In the middle of the 20th century, those with learning disabilities were invisible. Come on, Peter. Someone to see you. Warehoused, hidden, infanticide, forced sterilisation, shame, ignominy. The Supreme Court of the United States ruling that they should be sterilised against their will. They know how horrible their conditions are. 80% of today's children can be in a programme, they can be educated or trained, they know if they're hungry. Family after family, hundreds of thousands of them, giving up their children because of the medical establishment and the social establishment saying, "Your child needs to be removed. "Too different to belong." Many of them, if they were lucky, they had a family, but there were so many medical problems that they usually died, you know, very early. My grandparents' life, with all the privileges and support and opportunities that they had, still they found nothing for Rosemary and she would say to me, "There was nothing for Rosemary," and her voice would repeat it, "Nothing, nothing, nothing." They tried to make her into a Kennedy, you know. They tried to pretend that she wasn't special because even though the Kennedys had money and power, there wasn't really any good place to put Rosemary back then. She was a victim, just like everybody else. And finally, you know, the father, Joseph Kennedy, decided on this terrible medical procedure. At the age of 23, Rosemary had a lobotomy. Joseph Kennedy didn't tell the rest of the family. Surgeons drilled into Rosemary's brain to try and fix her. The operation was a disaster. Which left Rosemary more incapacitated. She really wasn't incapacitated before. She could kind of like "pass", you know, in society. I just don't know what happened, really, in their mind. I can see what happened, from my grandfather's point of view, an effort to help gone terribly awry. After the operation, Rosemary was sent away to a home for those with intellectual disabilities in Wisconsin. The rest of the family moved onwards and upwards, but Eunice couldn't forget her sister. I think, of all the members of the family, it really, really, really affected Eunice, that there was anger about it, there was remorse, and there was some amount of guilt and that's where she started directing her energies. My mother would not let Rosemary be erased from the family picture. And so, while there was in some ways great pressure to fix Rosemary, to remove Rosemary, to hide Rosemary, my mother pushed back at that slowly but relentlessly, over the course of her life. Somewhere in there was implanted a fierce determination to change the world and in some ways, I think that defined my mother's life, but also the lives of her brothers, who went into politics. NEWSREEL: Members of the Kennedy family. Former President Harry Truman and family. My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of Man. CHEERS AND APPLAUSE When her brother was elected President, my mother saw an opening and she drove a truck through. She wanted to change the laws, so that people with special needs would be protected under the law, could be educated under the law, could have fair housing under the law, and could really have fulfilling lives under the law, protection, dignity, respect. Eunice persuade JFK to set up a panel into what was then called mental retardation. Its advice was turned into the first US legislation for people with intellectual disabilities. And I think we have an obligation as a country, especially a country as rich as ours, we certainly should have the resources to spend to make a major effort to see if we can block this, stop it and cure it. So, this was not John F Kennedy's thing, this was Eunice's thing, and she had the Kennedy mystique and the presidential power behind her, but she had this idea that she was in the trenches. Well, my mother was a master politician, without ever holding political office. She must have somehow known that the window would be short. Couldn't have known how short it was, it ended up being for her brother. A month after he signed the Act into law, JFK was assassinated. During this period, Eunice also decided to expose the family's secret, bringing Rosemary's story out into the open for the first time and later, making sure she was a regular visitor to the Shriver family home, until her death in 2005. Well, I think when anybody wants to tell a story that some people in your family don't want you to tell, I think that requires bravery, it requires courage. Eunice began spending money from the family's charity on causes supporting people with intellectual disabilities. She ran things for the developmental disability, which her father was trying to like... Push into the... Yeah, and what did she do? She blasted it out. How did she pull that off? Then, she invited hundreds of children out of institutions and into her own backyard for sporting summer camps. I think she saw sports as a way to get these people out of the basement. Camp Shriver was the experiment, was the foundation for Special Olympics. Mummy was proving in our backyard that people with intellectual disabilities could compete, could run, could swim, could play archery, could ride horses. If you can go to Camp Shriver and imagine, 1962, children of colour, children of institutions, children from, if you will, almost locked up, hidden away places. And then, having the phone call come, "We want your children, come to my house, we're going to play "games together," I can only imagine the moms and dads... Maybe they didn't believe it, that their child who they didn't even admit to, in some cases, being invited to this home. After all, the President of the United States came to this house. Eunice made sure her entire family played a hands-on role. She did not encourage me. She told me. There was no encouraging going on! No encouraging. "Bobby, you will do that." "OK, yes, ma'am." For me, as a little boy, it was just play. But for the country, even though, again, people didn't necessarily notice it, it was the laying the groundwork for a cultural revolution that would end up, I think, sweeping the world. Special Olympics seemed to come along at the perfect time, it was 1968. You could make a case that 1968 was the most eventful year in American history. It was in between, you know, Martin Luther King's assassination, Bobby Kennedy's assassination, OK, and then there had been Vietnam at the beginning of the year, when that sort of burst upon the American public. That year sort of defined my generation for decades to come. How we looked at politics, how we looked at society. I would say... I'm going to use the word "change", how we tried to change, in civil right and things like this here, so there was a big change. But any change hadn't reached Connie Hernandez in Chicago. She was under pressure to dump her daughter Amelia into an institution. Mental health was always after me to put her away. And I couldn't do that. If I walked down the street with her, other kids would look and, you know, "What's wrong with her?" Or they would get out of the way. And grown up people as well. They would just stare. I was afraid when she first started riding the bus. One say, Connie took Amelia to a new Chicago parks programme for children with disabilities. When I took her to the park, I said, "Wow!" I was not by myself, I was not alone. I saw other kids, other parents. 23-year-old PE teacher Anne Burke ran the parks programme. She wanted to showcase the children's skills at a sports event. But nobody embraced the idea. The National Park and Recreation Association would not endorse us, the Department of Health and Education and Welfare would not endorse us, and our local charities, tribune charities, I went to see them and he yelled at me, "Who do you think you are, putting these people on display?!" But there was somebody who supported it - Eunice Kennedy Shriver. And what Eunice said to me was, "This is a good proposal, "but it's unacceptable." I nearly passed out at that point. But she went on to say that, "It's unacceptable because it's not "big enough, it should be larger, we should invite the country." And that's how it started. But six weeks before the first Special Olympics Games, Eunice suffered another family tragedy. Remember, she had three brothers die. One in the war, flying from England, and then, you know, President Kennedy, '63, Uncle Bobby in '68. So it was... How people survive that kind of thing, I don't know. Well, I think my mother channelled her pain into her work. Eunice and Sargent Shriver, they just kept going. They used, if you will, their position not to trade on the grief of the nation or loss nostalgia, they were always trying to do new things. Soldier Field, the site of many great sports events, is preparing for the more than 200 separate activities to take place there. Track and field, swimming, basketball, football, hockey, and not one of these events is out of the reach of a retarded child, who has been given a little help in learning how, who has been told, "You can do it!" The Olympic torch is carried down the track by a proud young runner. It was bright and sunny and 95 degrees. It was awful, actually, in terms of the heat. It felt like you were in the oven! But it was beautiful. It's the kind of experience other kids may take for granted. But until now, retarded children have never been counted in. The only thing that mattered was having fun, and the kids really did. The faces of the children and if they had parents with them, or their teachers or coaches, the response was overwhelming. A parent's pride matches the joy of his child. A whole new world of success has opened up for all of them. They get the gold medal. It's so cool to see it happen. They all have that, like, "I'm the winner" look, the same look, they don't have to say a word. It's amazing. Mrs Sargent Shriver, President Kennedy's sister, speaks to the athletes. In Ancient Rome, the gladiators went into the arena with these words on their lips. "Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt." My mom stood here 50 years ago and proclaimed to the world that the world would never be the same again. The unfortunate thing is there was nobody in the stands, no-one, because nobody embraced the idea. But she saw the vision and she was relentless from the beginning, in pursuing it. I was watching you run across that floor when you took the 50 yard dash. Amelia Hernandez was one of the athletes that day. I started Olympics here in 1968 when I was little, when I was 11 years old and I did the running, 50 metre dash. Half a century on, she's still competing. And I did all the events I did and then I kept going, I didn't stop. And all the sports I have, powerlifting, and I got medals from running and I got medals from bowling and bocce and hockey. The medal, 50 years, it says. 50 years. Most of them are powerlifting. Amelia's grown up to be a... You know, she's very independent. She does her own shopping, she goes to the store. I'm very proud of Amelia. Come on! In the soft evening light of a perfect summer day, 20,000 people welcome the competitors. Now held every two years, the World Games started to grow. They assembled at Perry Shorts Stadium from 50 states and eight foreign countries. There was TV coverage across America, more and more countries competing, but in Britain, there was nothing. "With Special Olympics now established in 13 countries, "we would like to see it introduced in Great Britain. "The Joseph P Kennedy Jr Foundation is prepared to work with "and offer assistance to a group willing to sponsor "Special Olympics in your country. "Very sincerely, Eunice Kennedy Shriver." Swimming coach Chris Maloney first contacted the Kennedys in 1978. I've got back to Eunice Shriver on a public phone box because then, remember, there were no computers, we're talking about the '70s, and I thought, "This is quite important, speaking to this famous lady." And I said, "I need help." Eunice sent films, brochures and equipment. Chris set off around the country. I would travel out and I would take the rostrum in my car, some medals and ribbons and so on, and I would run a Games because the only way really to show how Special Olympics worked then was to run a sort of mini Special Olympic Games. He found himself confronting ignorance in high places. It was an MP who was a friend of Eunice Shriver's, cos I asked her for names and contacts to set this thing up. "Ooh," he said, "I've been asked by Eunice to give you every help I can. "I will help you," he said. "But Chris, can they really run in a straight line?" Within a year, Chris had put together a small team for the 1979 World Games in New York. Some of them had never been on a plane before. One lady, for instance, she got them all proper swimming costumes with the Great Britain cap with the Union Jack on the cap. It was the joy and excitement I could see on the parents' faces and parents who spoke to me and said, "Chris, they've achieved something for the first time in their life. "We've got hope now, we've got something to aim for." It's incredible. That's what Special Olympics is all about. Work hard, enjoy and smile. That's the main motto, that's the way I see it. I said to one of the nurses, "is Greg OK?" And she said, "Yes, of course he is." And then someone else said to me, "I'm sorry to hear about your baby." I says, "What do you mean, sorry to hear?" And she said she'd heard that he was Downs. So, I asked if Pete could come in to see me and you weren't very good at all, were you? Not at all, no, no. I said, "Why me?" I remember punching the wall when I went back to Jacky's mum's and dad's house, you know. Why me? I was feeling sorry for myself, really. I kept saying, "Why have I made him that way?" Cos I was ignorant to the whole situation and it's nothing you've done. Funny enough, we had a visitor there and he was quite busy in the incubator, and she said, "He's going to be a gymnast." So... Little did we know! In gymnastics, level two world champion Greg Silvester was out to impress. First competition was Liverpool. It was 1980-something. I was entered in a competition. I was lucky to win my first bronze medal. The first one we went to in Everton, I was like this, terrible, I know! We have another United Kingdom winner, Gregory Silvester, our gold medallist! Greg's greatest achievement was gold at the 1995 World Games. I enjoyed it a lot, meeting new friends, super. Atmosphere's brilliant. Challenging for medals came easily to Greg. Challenging perceptions was harder. I have been picked on, a few times. When I was in college, I was doing a sports leadership course and one of the students, this young lad, he took the Mickey out of me. "Oh, look, here comes Spacker." I felt a bit low, a bit down because of what he said. When he was really tiny, someone we knew called him retarded and I just didn't like that. Mongol was the horrible word that was used. Luckily, it's not used now. People when they see you, they come to patronise you. Literally. Like they'd say, "Hello, how are you? "Oh, aren't you lovely?" And I'm thinking, "Thank you, but with all respect, I'm a young man, "I know I've got a learning disability, "but please don't patronise me." It'll be a lot better now and I've been working about 22, 23 years. And I've always loved my job, no matter what I do. The Stirling Games. That's the bronze. 30 years after he started, Greg is still competing. He's also a qualified gymnastics coach, board member and ambassador for Disability Sport. As he goes to schools and colleges and that to do talks, people are shocked that a Downs person can go and stand and talk. Somebody who has a learning disability can achieve something. Even if people think, "Can you? Can you not?" Well, I've proven that I can. Me and my family. I know that I can swim four miles in the ocean. They couldn't do that. I won my medals and I got more than 100. Winning the gold medal was one of my best achievements. I feel like this is where I belong. And I just feel like myself here. By the 1980s, Special Olympics World Games were drawing big crowds and big names. Tonight, we open the largest sport event in the world, this year. One of the things Eunice was able to do was enlist celebrities to the cause. You can make fun of that, but that's what you need to do. Ladies and gentlemen, Bart Conner and Nadia Comaneci. A lot of volunteers, as former athletes, who are a part of the organisation, and they have respect for what we have done and when we talk about Special Olympics, I think people listen and then you bring them, you get them involved. It was almost like, "How you doing, Bob? "Can you be at this place at this time?" So, it's almost as if she was saying, you know, you've got to do it. It came naturally. That's why I don't count the years of involvement because for me, it's natural. I don't really talk about it, but I think that's my mission in my life. You know, OK, I'm a good football player, but I think this is the story of my life. Eunice, she is just such a bad mama jamba! She just was. She knew what she was doing and knew that people of profile and celebrities of certain stature had that voice to really help be the voice of people who didn't have and people who are misunderstood. Hello, I'm Christopher Reeve. When we were making the film Superman, I got a chance to work with some really amazing people from Special Olympics. We did this film and I had a series of photographs afterwards and I took some with a write up to our local paper and I said, "I've got some pictures here of children with learning difficulties, "mentally handicapped, then." And he said, "Chris, that might offend people." That was in the '70s, putting these in the paper. I said, "Well, it's with Christopher Reeve, who plays..." "Hang on a bit, let's have a look, then." And that appeared in the paper. My mom had a great capacity to go to the top, find those people and bring them onside and it didn't matter whether they were Republicans or Democrats, liberals or conservatives, capitalists or communists. That meant continually pushing her cause at the White House, regardless of who was President. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States of America, Bill Clinton. CHEERS AND APPLAUSE Ladies and gentlemen, we must also thank the person whose inspiration, leadership and determination has brought us all here today, the founder of these Games, Eunice Shriver. CHEERS AND APPLAUSE First of all, she was a very striking woman. She was tall, angular, she had this great shock of hair, you know, and she would just stare at you, stare a hole at you and was pushing her cause. She was the classic example of a tiny group of people that we identified when I was President, they were called the "just say yes" people. In other words, they came at you, you were going to do what they wanted to do, so you might as well save yourself a lot of time and trouble and go on and say yes. That's what Eunice was. You know, she was so intense. But it was loving, you know. It wasn't like irritable, it was loving. You knew that she was right, you knew that she was trying to get you to do something that was right. Come to our world, where we compete as friends. Not enemies. A world where Saudi Arabia and Israel, Latvia, Lithuania and the Soviet Union are united on our playing fields. Gradually, the Games saw more and more nations taking part. I think a big leapfrog was, and its real success, was international. That's what really struck me, this idea that it became a world phenomenon. To see people in Mali and Kathmandu and out in the countryside there who are really marginalised get a chance to, you know, play soccer on a formal field with a referee or do a 50 yard dash or something, it's exhilarating to see. Eunice had called me and asked me, this was about the mid '80s, and she said, "Could you come to help us "celebrate the growth of Special Olympics?" And I said, "I would love to help, but unfortunately, "next week, I'm going to be in Zimbabwe." And she said, "Oh, do you know President Mugabe?" I said, "No, I don't know a lot of heads of state." And she said, "Well, let me call him because we don't have a programme "yet in Zimbabwe. Will you help us?" And literally, within three weeks, we had Special Olympics Zimbabwe. And to me, that really defines the power of this amazing woman. Even though I was going to say no, she figured out a way I could say yes. Eunice also convinced Nelson Mandela to help spread her message. Some of these children with disabilities get worse because of the way we and their parents treat them. Because they don't treat them as human beings. When he decided to join the Special Olympics movement, opened doors for us all over the world. And people throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, leaders in Zimbabwe and Zambia and Kenya and Tanzania and obviously in South Africa. It's one of the few things really that has united the world. I mean, that has united, you know, the NATO countries and the Mid East and the Far East and Africa. By the 1990s, more than 150 countries competed in Special Olympics. It had changed people's lives in pockets of plenty of places. Now, it was time to try and change attitudes in an entire nation. You know, it was rural Ireland in 1963, so I suppose it's the closest we ever got to hysteria, really, was on that day. The excitement and the hullabaloo that it brought was unbelievable. We were getting ready for weeks, months, beforehand. My dad even bought an American flag. In 1963, JFK revisited the family's origins, this small farmhouse in County Wexford. A century earlier, his ancestors had left here for a new life in America. My mum was here and all the ladies from the parish, making the teas. And she said that he asked her, did she make the cake? And she just looked at him and she just couldn't speak. So I suppose the fact he was from Wexford and from here and he was so powerful. There was 40 million people in the United States that had emigrated for a better life and he came back to show he was proud of what he came from. To go from leaving here from nearly desperation to be in that position of power within a couple of generations is quite amazing. And we were lined up like a little guard of honour to the helicopter and he stopped and talked to some of us and just got up on the plane then and waved goodbye and everyone said goodbye and he said he'd come back. Today, in these athletes' story, the Irish dream of freedom and dignity and justice is fulfilled. 40 years after JFK's visit, his sister brought her power and the power of Special Olympics back to Ireland. In 2003, the country hosted the first World Summer Games to be staged outside America. I think they probably worried, could a small country pull that off? And would it get the support? I remember a couple of us thinking - how on Earth are we going to organise? That's multi-sport, 165 countries, that you're going to require thousands and thousands and thousands of volunteers. I think it was a very emotional place to bring the Games, to go where President Kennedy had gone on his visit to Ireland, to go back to places where over the years we'd visited to plant trees and do memorials and remember. Host towns across the island welcomed countries. During the infancy of the peace process, this was a Games for north and south. Without the two prime ministers, there would have been no agreement. They'd played a unique role in a unique set of talks. It wasn't that long after the Good Friday Agreement and anything that brings people together in a non-adversarial way is good. There were challenges to that, but I think in its own way, the Games made ther own contribution to that sense of coming together. You had the Irish Garda Siochana, the Irish name for the police force, and we had the RUC, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which never had an association, and they were in the Special Olympics together. The peace process wasn't the priority for the O'Callaghans in summer 2003. For them, the Games were more personal. I tell you, I'd be lost without her. Lost without her now. But when she was born, I was devastated. There's no use going behind the door, I was devastated. I don't think I let anybody bother me. Yeah, I've been in shops where the parents will be talking. And then you'd have the children looking around, staring. And Deirdre would say to me, "Mam, why is she staring at me?" I'd say, "Deirdre, it's rude to stare at anybody, "so don't mind them." We never thought that she'd be able to walk out in the morning and go to work on her own, go to town or the shops on her own. Your achievements remind us of the potential to greatness that resides in every one of us. The opening ceremony took place at Croke Park, Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and U2 amongst the guests. But then, the athletes became the real stars, athletes like Deirdre. Part of the Irish team, a huge Irish team, getting cheered, it was like, you know, immense pride. It was great. She was the centre of attention, she was a celebrity, she really enjoys that, she really enjoys the limelight. The whole country embraced the competitors. You suddenly realise that actually this is magic. Pure unadulterated joy that you can see on the faces of the athletes and on the faces of the families. It's amazing. Truly amazing. And I think it integrated it into the psyche of Ireland. It certainly has removed the bias, any bias, I think that was all banished into the skies. Oh, my God! That changed... That changed completely here. That was an opening. An opening. Big time. Before then, I wouldn't know the people up the road. I have one or two photographs I can show you that the neighbours in this road, what they done when they heard Deirdre was in the Games. I came round the corner and there was all these balloons and all these flags and I was like... When I left at seven this morning, it was just a regular housing estate. They said they were going to have a street party. She thought she was the Queen of Sheba! Everybody was, "Hiya, Deirdre! Hiya, Deirdre!" Even the schools all knew about her. It chokes you, you know, because it's such warmth. 15 years on, events like these National Games are the legacy of 2003, emphasising the knowledge and support of Special Olympics here. Ireland is the most successful Special Olympics programme globally and I think a lot of that has to do with being the first Games outside America. The Disability Rights movement in Ireland is strong today, the inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities is central in Ireland today. And for that, we're very proud. Deirdre is preparing for her second World Games in Abu Dhabi. I think it opens people's eyes. I think people realise what they're capable of being able to do. Nice kick! Just a little straighter, your legs. See, my leg is way out like that, then I go up and down. Well into her 80s, with 100,000 Special Olympics events a year worldwide, still Eunice refused to slow down. She kept pushing. She felt the sting of being trivialised. And treated as doing work that didn't matter, her whole life. It infuriated her. It didn't stop her. We cannot pause in our efforts. Think for a moment of those in Washington DC, where I live, who cry at night because they do not understand... They do not understand why they have no friends! She was fighting all the time and so she was pushing all the time, so if you were in her life, you had to understand that you also had to get in the fight, you also had to be a warrior, because she didn't have patience for people who weren't. And she had a vision and she fought for it till her dying day. No question about it. The rage, she went to her grave with that. Eunice died in 2009. Special Olympics athletes at her funeral tossed their medals into her grave. I used to always think, "I want to be one of your special children," and that's the way she always thought of Special Olympian athletes, they were her sixth child and they were her extended family. Without their founder, the Games go on. They've been to China, Japan, Korea, Greece, and back Stateside to Los Angeles in 2015. So, this is my mother's office, as it was when she left us. The mementos of her whole life, pictures of her time with her brothers and sisters in childhood, all small pieces of the story that she held dear. Today, we keep, for people in the Special Olympic movement, athletes, family members, volunteers, sponsors, come here and they're able to see a little bit of who she was. The next World Games take place in Abu Dhabi. This time, with 7,000 athletes from more than 170 countries. You get the breeze through your face, it feels like you're flying and you're having a fantastic time. One of the athletes is Kiera Byland. I just struggled to understand writing, reading, numbers, telling the time, which I still struggle to, today. Show me where 100 grams is. Can you see that? So, put some carrots in and try and weigh out 100 grams. Let's pop that on there. I put Kiera in the category of the invisible child. You can't see Kiera's impairment and when people say, "Well, what's wrong with her?" And I say, "Well, there's nothing wrong with her, "it's just that she has many autism traits." Two threes, two twos, two fives, two sixes and then, all of a sudden, your favourite bit of the race, six, seven, eight, nine. Mm-hm, yeah. People don't believe it. Or if you've got a child who has got a learning disability, you will go through that period where you don't want to believe it yourself. And then you certainly don't want to tell anybody else about it because, will that have an impact on them in life? I really struggle making friends, I didn't really quite understand at that point why. So I used to, like, cry. I used to cry myself to sleep, actually. Kiera's one passion was to make a friend and have friends. So I thought I was worthless and then, I'd do something wrong, I didn't know how to handle it, so I did used to hit myself, thinking, "Oh, that will make it all better." When I started to find food in her room, and she'd hidden it and ate it, I was really worried. And then, she would literally hit herself. And smack herself and say, "I'm useless, I'm rubbish." And that upsets me now. Because I just think, I should have taken that away, that's what mums do, so it still upsets me now. At her lowest point, Kiera sought refuge in sport. First, swimming and then, cycling. I think Kiera found something that she was good at. It's given me confidence. It's given me the chance to believe in myself and I'm actually worth something. Kiera was Great Britain's most successful competitor at the last World Summer Games in Los Angeles, winning three gold medals. That was it, I suppose. Seeing her on the podium, then, and you can't help but think back to all the bad times and you think, "Wow! "We've got through all that lot. Look at this. This is payback." So, it's great. I actually use the sport to help me feel better and also my friends there because they want to be there, they like cycling. And that helps me as well. Kiera is hoping to match her medal haul this time around. I'm hopefully going to win three golds cos I know I managed that last time in LA. Hopefully, I can try. They were taking me down here, basically 20-25 metres from where I had been standing, I reached this door and they opened the door and as I walk in, I couldn't believe my eyes. Here was this youngster, completely silent, staring basically straight into the wall, and chains. Recognised he probably had autism and although I hated myself for it, I thought, "I need to take a picture of this." And then, I turned to the mother and said, "Could you please unlock him?" So, she did. He was totally non-verbal. I noticed that they had basically treated him like a thing. TRANSLATION: Because he was mentally sick, that is why he was tied up. He was shouting, fighting people and biting them. I have a wound myself after he bit me. He could fight people, laughing at him. So, I showed it to our president, Tim Shriver, and he immediately felt, we have to do something. It makes your... ..whole body shudder, to see a child with a locked chain on his ankle. Intellectual disability is associated with a bad omen, with taboo, and other bad things. So, a person with intellectual disability is generally discriminated and there are places where a person with intellectual disability is not allowed, even to step in. We engaged Special Olympics Tanzania to come from Dar es Salaam to the refugee camp, 1,800km, quite a distance. And we never want to see that child again in that chain and so, we have come, they said to her, to bring new hope to you, to your family, and to your son. Special Olympics now runs weekly competitions in the refugee camp, bringing those with intellectual disabilities out of the shadows. So far, we have recruited well over 200 athletes in the camp, who are normally doing, you know, football, athletics and other sports. One of them is Malaki. His feet free from chains, he's been chosen to compete at the World Summer Games. TRANSLATION: I was very happy with their trust in me for the Games in Abu Dhabi. Life has changed since they came to pick me up. Now, things are OK. TRANSLATION: He's very happy. Something changed. What made him happy is that he was given clothes and a ball. That made him happy. Oh, it's amazing! It's amazing! This is something that he had never imagined would happen. And quite a lot of attitudes have been changed. And persons with intellectual disabilities are being accepted. 18 months after he freed him, Nils and Malaki were reunited. Well, for me, it was a very emotionally strong experience to again see Malaki, so much better. Now, he's starting to become verbal. Clearly, his life has completely changed, but much more than the change in him, you could see how his mother doesn't see him now as a problem. But sees him as her son. When President Mandela said that freedom consists in breaking the chains, it's not a metaphor. Sometimes, the chains are chains. And sometimes, the urgency is that acute. We need to break a chain... ..that's holding a child. It's a reminder of how important this work is and how much hope the world still needs, when it comes to those who are different. She entered a field that she had to know from the beginning would be a field that people would be largely indifferent to. She was in a situation where her sister was lobotomised. Decades later, we're not only not lobotomising people, they were legitimising people. That's her shaking change that I can't think that too many other people make. The athletes are so driven now, I think that there are some track and field guys that probably could make the Olympic trials. That would be wonderful. There's so many disturbing things going on today and this is nothing but good, just raw energy for good. Special Olympics has helped me develop confidence. It helped me a lot to be a happy guy throughout the year. And I don't feel sad any more. The whole world is watching you! Look how far you've come! CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
