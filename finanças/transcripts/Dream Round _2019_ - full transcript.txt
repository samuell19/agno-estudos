Now to the 18th. And our leader with a two shot lead, he has a difficult 20 footer for a birdie. That's my boy. Really puts the pressure. Put it in the hole. Good speed. Put it in the hole. Just lifted, a tap in for par. Hi, Mr. Bona, how are you today? Same as I was yesterday. And last week and last month. Why do you keep asking me? 'Cause you sit outside by yourself all the time. You look so sad. I'm fine. I'm listening to the game. How about you run along? You know I'm gonna check on you later. Do whatever you want. Sweet kid. He missed a four foot putt? I could have made that blindfolded in my old days. Five years in a row, you won the local cup. Congratulations. Right on. Sarah. Come on in and get your homework done. I'm coming. Sarah, I don't get what you find so interesting about that man. You're over there every time I turn around. I don't think he has any family, Grandma. He's a grumpy old man and I just don't see what see is so fun about him. I just miss Mommy and Daddy. Aw, I do too. Things are gonna get better. We'll get through this together. Now, come on in the house, wash up and get your homework done. Okay, Grandma. I already did my homework. Oh, that's my girl. Yeah. Eh. What else. Another visit from trailer park security. You're funny, Mr. Bona. I have a very interesting question for you. Why do you keep bothering me all the time? I wouldn't call it that. Why don't you play some music? I don't like music. I like sports. I prefer golf. I played golf a long time ago but not anymore. But that's a radio. That's what you're supposed to do, listen to music. You ask too many questions. Time for you to skedaddle. To what? What does that mean? Skedaddle means go. You must leave now. You're funny even when you're not trying. I'll be seeing you, kid. It's time for me to take my middle age nap. There you go again, you're funny. I got to quit. Eh, nah. I'm fine. Take this with me. Ah, nah, I'm thirsty. Mr. Bona? Mr. Bona? What are you doing here? You gonna answer me? What are you doing in my house? You dropped mail and I was just- - What's that in your hand? It's a golf ball? It's pink. Do not ever, ever touch that ball again! I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. This ball is never to be touched. You have no right being in my home let alone touching my things. Now get out of here! I'm sorry. The kids and I are going shopping, you wanna come? Nah, I can't. I gotta review these papers for morning. Why do you keep slaving day in and day out for this company? You don't need to keep slaving over this job. I have an idea. Kids, please come here for a minute. Are we leaving yet? Come here, I have an announcement. This year, I am gonna give your father the best Christmas gift ever. I want you to take a year off and I want you to pursue your dreams. Come on. If that's write a book, then write a book. If it's playing golf then become a pro. Okay. We're gonna go now. You ready? Hey, I'm serious about what I said. Yeah, you're so sweet. I'll catch up later. Yeah. Love you, honey. Yeah, I love you too. Bye daddy. Bye. Get off of that couch, wake up! Joe, hey. Don't you think it's time? Who are you? How'd you get into my trailer? Oh, how soon we forget. By the looks of this place we got a lot of work to do, Joe. Well, somebody, I don't even know who you are. You look a little familiar. Well I can see why you don't remember who I am. My name is Graham Scott. At one time I was one of the best golfers in the world. But like everything else in this, well, everything passes, Joe. Listen, old man, I think it's time for you to leave. Can I get the door for you? Oh, no, get dressed, okay? It's not gonna be easy to get you back into shape, Joe. You, my friend, are going to compete in the Arizona Open. Why would I? I don't play golf anymore. Oh, come on now. Why don't you get your ass off that couch and let's go to the driving range, huh? Don't worry, I'll grow on you, Joe. Yeah. If I have a few balls, will you leave me alone? Oh, Joe. Once you feel that club connect with that ball on a perfect drive, oh, there's nothing better. And you know it, Joe. Come on. Can we get something to eat first? Sure. Why don't you pull something moldy out of that refrigerator of yours and let's go, huh? Wait a minute, you need to shave, Joe. Yeah, it's time you started looking somewhat presentable. Okay? All right? I'll wait for you outside. Come on, chop chop. I must have been dreaming. Hello? Let's go hit some balls. I dusted off your clubs, come on. Yeah I don't know about this. Yeah you do. Here we go. Ah, little gait issue. Maybe some posture, weight. We'll work on the posture. I bet you we will. Don't worry. I got this. No, I got this. Here we go. You remember how to get there, don't you? Maybe. Good ball. That's the one right there. Remember! Look at the ball. Put your weight on your heels. Excuse me, do you mind? Oh, I knew that was gonna happen. What you will, you shall receive. Ugh! Oh. Don't worry, Joe. We'll get you back into shape. Again. One second. Nice swing, kid. Again. Mr. Bona? Mr. Bona. What happened to you? Occupational hazard, I guess. Hmm. Well Sarah said you weren't golfing anymore. Yeah, short-lived, believe me. Well, the reason I came over is because I wanted to apologize. I am so sorry. She had no business being in your home. Shouldn't walk into a stranger's home. What if I was a crazy guy? Her parents need to teach her better than that, you know? I'm Sarah's grandmother and her parents passed away a little more than a year ago. So sorry, I didn't know. Hasn't been easy. I cry myself to sleep almost every night. I lost my family 15 years ago. My wife, my son and daughter in a car crash. Something I don't like talking about. I am truly sorry. Well, Sarah said you have a lot of trophies and golf memorabilia. She is fascinated. I do. If it's all right with you I'd like to show her all that stuff. I think that would cheer her up. Great, anytime. I'll tell her. Thank you, Mr. Bona. You're welcome. Oh, I have one condition. You both call me Joe. Thank you, Joe. You're welcome. Come in. Come in. Sorry about the other day. I didn't mean to scare you. It's okay, I shouldn't have been in here. Come on, I'll show you something. It's been a long time since I've shown these to anyone. Wow. In this picture you're kinda fat. Times like to eat. Yeah, I won a lot of tournaments back then. I got a lot to be grateful for. If you think that picture was funny, I got a lot more to show you in here. Come on, let's sit down. Are you hurting or something? Let's just say it's old age. Wow, you were famous. Yeah not quite. This is when I won my third championship. Boy, it was a big event. And this right here, oh yeah. It was a cool invitational. I could still hear the crowd like it was yesterday. Can I ask you a question? Sure. That pink golf ball, what are the letters? That was my daughter's ball. She used it for the first time she ever played golf. Her name was Maria. Initials were MB. Was? Yeah. Your grandma told me about your mom and dad. I lost my family too. I hope it wasn't in a car accident because that's how my parents died. It was. But you know what, kid? From now on, you and I are old friends, best friends. And you could drive that little scooter of yours by here anytime and I won't tell you to skedaddle. Just don't ask me a thousand questions. Okay, Mr. Bona. All right, so you know what, I don't mean to be short or rude but my back is killing me. I need to get some rest. It's okay. Grandma said I can only be here for a while anyway. Okay. All right kid, thanks. I'll see you later, Mr. Bona. I mean, Joe. Okay. All right, thanks, kid. Today's a new day, Joe, all right? We've got a slight wind that's gonna push your ball to the right so I don't wanna see any has or rockets from you, okay? Nice. It's been a long time, old man. Don't jinx me. Nice. Not bad, not bad at all. I'm racking my brain trying to figure out where I know you from. Oh, why don't you spend some of that brain racking time thinking about your game? Nice hit, man. Right, we're off. Somebody put you up to this? What do you mean? Why such an interest in my golf game? You have the same problem you've always had. You don't know how to count your blessings. Yeah, there you go again, it's as if you've known me my whole life. One wonderful thing about being my age, Joe, is the incredible amount of wisdom that comes with it. I know more about you than you know about yourself. You're speaking in the foreign tongues again. Are you gonna golf today or what? You still have a long way to go to get back to where you once were. Just gotta concentrate, gotta concentrate. That's what I'm talking about. That's good, that's good. Nice and easy. Okay, that's good, but, there's still something, okay? When you're looking this way, you need to be looking down at the ball first. Okay, all right? Just take a look. And keep your head down, don't turn. Almost, almost. Okay. How's your back, huh? Huh? Listen. All right. Nice and easy, slow. Okay. That felt good. Good, good. That's what we need, good. Oh yeah. Ho ho! Hey, can I get an amen! Here, catch it. Ah, oh you're dead! Guys, settle down. Come on, let me see that. Hey Mr. Bona. Grandma said you were golfing again. That's great. Joe, remember? Oops. It's a beautiful Saturday morning. What are you gonna do, ride that thing all day long? Pretty much. Nothing really else to do. Hey I got an idea. Why don't you come golf with me? You can pretend to be my caddy. What's a caddy? Caddy's a person that carries the clubs and the bag. But you, you can't carry it. You're about the size of a twig. Should have fun. That sounds awesome. But I need to ask Grandma. I hear you both. Sarah, you use your best manners with Mr. Bona. And you make sure Joe, that you have her home before supper. Of course. Don't take your eyes off of her. Out on the golf course, haha. There's the putting range. Ah, stop right here. You're a little too excited today. I didn't know golfing could be so much fun, Mr. Joe. Hey, get my putter. Ah, never mind, you don't know what clubs are yet. Hold on. How did you know it was a putter? It says putter right on it, duh. Do you mind? I'm trying to putt here. Sorry. Shh, Sarah. Sorry. You can do it! Good job, Mr. Bona. You can't yell out here while I'm trying to play. You're making it hard on me. So please, please be quiet while I try to shoot. You got it, I promise. Good job! Now, you can yell. Good job, Mr. Bona. Okay, here we are, first tee. Yup. So put the ball between the two markers. And I'm gonna crank it. Yup. I'm gonna put it up there. A little crooked. All right I'm gonna do this. Blowing bubbles? We just got here. I gotta concentrate on this, okay? Good hit, Mr. Bona. Yeah. A little weak. So we got 18, 17 more to go. Maybe I'll hit a good one. Let's go back to the cart. You drive. Okay there's the ball, let me get my club. And my seven iron. Here we go, all right. Okay, so. I have to put it on the green. See the white flag over there? - Yeah. - That's where we're going with, okay? Okay. Ah, sh- Good job, Mr. Bona. Good job? I just fricking put it in the lake. Well yeah, but nice form. Yeah. I'm too stiff to have nice form. You know what would make you loosen up? The floss, try it. What the heck? What do you call that? The floss. Like dental floss? No, it's a dance. Try it. All right. Doh! Nah, I'm not doing no floss. Let's go look for the ball, come on. Okay, let's go. Yeah, get in the car and drive me. Okay. Here we go. Go that way. Don't put me in the lake. Thank God. They got great pie here. That sounds good. I think I'll have one. Hey Joe, how's it going? Great Murphy, all right. What, you working all the time? Never get a day off, do you? Not with all these snowbirds. I really need a vacation. Maybe someplace far away. Like the Philippines. Why the Philippines? Like you don't know? Who's this kid? Hello, I'm Sarah. I live right next door to Mr. Bona. Mr. Bona, who's that? It's me. So what are you doing hanging around with a bum like this? I'm just kidding, really. Let me get your waitress for you. Jennifer! Right Murph, thank you. Thanks a lot. Always, my friend. How you doing, guys? Joe, right? Do I know you? Jennifer. Greene. Don't you remember me? Have we met? Yeah. Years ago. You come in, you'd sit at that same booth everyday. You'd order coffee. Cream with two sugars. The servers used to call you Two Sugars. Oh yeah, it's coming back to me. That was a long time ago, 15 years ago. Man, you got a great memory. And this must be your daughter. No, we're friends. Well, actually neighbors. My name's Sarah. Mr. Bona lives in the trailer next door to me and my Grandma. I wanted to see him golf. He is a pro. I'm not a pro. Let's get this straight. Let's order. Okay. Sarah, how about we start with you? What'll it be? I'll have, let me see. I think, a slice of the apple pie, chicken tenders and an iced tea. Can I get my pie first please? What, are you kidding? What are you from Europe? That's silly. Grandma let's me get desserts before dinner. Well I think it's a great choice. I'll bring out your pie first. How about for you, Joe? I'll take the club sandwich with French fries and a cup of coffee. Perfect. Anything else? No, thanks. All right. I'll have that out for you right away. Thank you. Hey Mr. Bona, guess who has the hots for you. The hots, who? The waitress. Hopefully she's not a clinger. She doesn't have the hots for me. And what's with this clinger stuff, you're only 10 years old! Everyone knows what that means. You should ask her out on a date sometime, Mr. Two Sugars. I don't date. Nobody my age dates. It's Joe, remember? And I don't like that sugar thing. Okay. Mr. Two Sugars. Oh, boy, you're a funny kid. She's perfect for you. You're both kinda old. Oh, you're really on a roll now. She's really pretty. I like her. Yeah, she's all right but we gotta change the subject. So how's about school? Here you go. Here you go. I see you're not wearing a wedding ring. Oh. Yeah no, I'm not married. See. I told you. You told me what? All right. What's going on here? I was telling Joe that I think you're his type. Really, mmm. Well if I remember correctly, Joe is married. But I don't see a ring on that finger. How's the pie? I'll go check on that order. I make a good wing girl, don't I? I don't know what you make. But I'm gonna go back and talk to your grandmother as soon as we get home. Hey Murph! Come on, lemme ask you something. How is everything, my friend? Everything's great. I think the best food in town. And best pies too. Let me ask you something. Yeah? So that waitress Jennifer. Is that the same Jennifer from 15 years ago that had that restaurant on Power? It is. She made her chops from working here about 15 years ago, 16 years ago. She went out on her own, made a lot of money. Word is that her partner was robbing her for years. Lost everything. Too bad. Great worker. She's a great gal. This is for you, sweety. Thank you. Oh that's nice. You two have a good one. And Joe, great seeing you around here again. Thanks, buddy. This is too big. Here, have it, Two Sugars. It's a nice hat. All right. Just checked in on your orders. Be up in a couple minutes. Hey Joe, it's really great seeing you again. It's been too long. I like seeing you as well. Be right back. Cool hat, huh? Hey I got one for you. How much does it cost a pirate to get his ears pierced? How much? A buck an ear! Pretty funny. How's the pie? So good. Hey, wanna go golfing next week? Yeah. All right, cool. Come on, eat up. Come on, let's go. All right. And this time, I'm driving the cart. Oh darn. I'll still caddy for you. Hey, I had a great time. Thanks for bringing me with you. Of course. I can't believe they didn't take your scooter from you. It's still here, huh? Yeah we do live in a trailer park. Joe, I like you better when you're not dead. You need more friends. I know Jennifer would keep you company. Beside, you can't always count on me. I'm a kid. I do have a life, you know. Bye. The kid's something else. Man. See that guy over there? That's the guy you gotta put your sights on. He's the course pro. When you beat him, then you're gonna be ready for the Jani King Arizona Open. I've not played in that open. Look, Joe. The best way for you to get out from under this cloud you've been living under is for you to play in that game and we both know that, all right? Turning pro is your dream, Joe. And now you've got another chance at it. And to heal. It's what your family wanted. And quite frankly, it's the key to your salvation. You're one persuasive person. Yes I am. Now I want you to go over there and tell that guy you want to play a round or two with him, okay? Go do it. Excuse me. You Sean McLaw? Um, yeah. Course pro? Yup. What's a guy like me have to do to get an opportunity to play golf with a guy like you? Oh wow. I get little things all the time. But I've seen you here before. You know what I'll do? I got a spot, seven a.m. tomorrow. I will give you 13 strokes, 18 holes for 500 bucks. 500 bucks cash, cash. Yeah, look, I live in a trailer park. Yeah it's not my problem you live in a trailer park, brother. No. If I lose, I'll give you 10 grand. 10 grand? 10 grand. I'll get the 500 bucks. I'll give you 13 strokes. Okay, I'll get the 500 dollars. We got a deal? Deal. Deal? Yeah, it's a deal. Deal. All right, sure. All right, thank you, thank you. Nice swing. Hey, Joe. Sitting at your booth. How you doing? I'm doing great, thanks. Where's Sarah today? Sarah has a life, so she says. Oh, I can imagine. What I wouldn't give to be that age again. You and me both. So what'll it be? Just coffee. Cream with two sugars. Are you sure you don't want anything else? Nah. Okay, no problem. There she is. Hey you. Hi. How you doin'? Thank you so much for swinging by. I have your book in the back. Oh, Margo, this is Joe. Joe, this is my very best friend Margo. Nice to meet you. The pleasure's all mine. Okay, I'm gonna go grab your book. I'll be right back. So, how did you meet Jennifer? We go back about 15 years. Really? Me and Jennifer grew up together since we were six. She's an absolute doll. Oh, you can say that again. There you go, Mr. Two Sugars. How'd you like it? Oh, I loved it. I know you would. So what are you ladies reading these days? Oh, it's a Dorothy Lynn romance novel. You should read that. Well, I'll let you get back to work. All right, sweety. Thanks for coming in. Okay, I gotta say goodbye to Murphy before I leave. You know I like that big Italian guy. - Okay, I know you do. - Bye. - Bye, sweety. - Mhmm. So, how'd you like your coffee? Perfect. Your friend, she's kinda sweet. Oh, she is one in a million. Are you sure you don't want anything else? Nah, coffee's fine. All right. Listen, I don't wanna sound too forward or anything, but, would you maybe wanna go out and grab dinner sometime? Are you asking me out? Just two old acquaintances getting to know each other again? Sarah says I should get out and meet more people. Well, Sarah is a very smart girl. You know what, I'ma take you up on your offer. Perfect. I am off all day tomorrow. Call me when you're done? I will. Thank you. You keep beating me, you got honors. Yeah, I think it's my honors right here. Yeah, I think so. You know what? This is about one, about 155, 160. Think it's an undulated green. You don't want to go too close to the pin so you can fall back. Nice shot. Every single time. Can you give me a break? Ah, shit. Ah, shit. Good job. Yeah, I missed the green again. Yeah, just relax into it. You're rushing every single hole. Make sure you line it up. I can do this. I know you can. I don't think you talking to your shoulder is gonna help you much with that putt. You're not lining up. I am and I'm doing it. Okay, do it. Do you need a putter or a three wood? I don't have it. Let's see here. In the hole! That's how it's done. 18th hole, you got honors again. Yeah we do. It's a tough hole. Tough hole. Actually I'm gonna hit a iron here you know, to draw it back. But hit it soft. You're the course pro, I don't know. Five wood to draw it in. Great shot. It just went straight. Well you can putt like nobody else. Need help with that, old man? - No. - No? I got it. You got it, okay. Ah! You know, quick like, I just wanna line it up. Here it comes. - Oh. - Ah. Want me to tap it in or you wanna go? Go ahead. Finish it up. Can't even finish it up. Three putt. Four putt. Four putt. That's the way the day's been all day today. Okay. Nice game. - All right. - You're good. I owe you some money. You're good. I have it in the car, thank you. You think I got a shot at a comeback? Actually, I really think you do. Okay. Thank you. Get the fuck out of here. Hi, Jen. Well, how did your round with Shane go? Exactly how I planned it. I let him win. I'm sure you did. Hey, I wanna ask you. Have you ever tried yoga? Hey, go on. I'm so glad you're up for this. It's a good way for us to get reacquainted, right? Yeah, I don't know about this. You're fine, you're fine. Get on your mat there. I don't think it's my thing. Just do what I do, you're fine. Okay. It could be really good for your golf game. So you say. This is really painful. Okay, let's switch it up. Sit on your tush, come on, let's go. There you go. - You good? - Yeah. You all right, okay. That's fine. So tell me about your game with Shane. It's what I was expecting. He really loves himself. Ugh. I could say that for sure. Yeah, he is not one of my favorite people. I can see why. Hello class, and welcome new student. Let's get started. This is a class? Not the kind of date you were expecting, huh? Date? I had no idea. Are you sure about that? Let's get started. Oh my god. I hope my insurance is paid up. What? - Look at her, not me. - Oh. I gotta watch her? Shh. This is for the birds. Some workout. You do this all the time? When I can afford it. Oh my god. Thank you so much for coming to class today. It was so nice having you. Hope you liked our class and hope to see you back at our next session. Yeah, maybe, but, I'm not wearing ballet pants like that guy over there. Although he'd make a good caddy. Well, students come in all shapes and sizes. Jennifer, I almost forgot. Thought I'd give you your invoice for last month and this month. Other than mailing it. Oh, wow. Thank you. I must have overlooked it. I will have that check to you as soon as possible. - Of course. - Yeah, okay. Until I see you both again, namaste. Namasake to you too. Namaste. So. Do you wanna go grab a bite to eat? Boy, that sounds good. I better soak my body in ice for a few weeks. Okay. All right. No, seriously, I got a early tee time tomorrow and I need to run a few errands. Oh, all right. Well, can I call you later, make sure you haven't frozen stiff from your ice bath? Yeah, sure. I can't move right now. I'ma cool down a little bit. Okay. All right, Mr. Two Sugars. I'll talk to you later. I hope so. Jeez, I'm never coming back to this fricking place. I must be kidding myself. Without my family, it's not worth it. It's time to stop feeling sorry for yourself, Joe. You're not the one that died that day. Graham? I must be losing my mind. Rise and shine, let's go. I know you're in there, come on. Hey. What the hell is your problem? I feel like I've been out here banging on your door for years. Now get dressed. We got a few things to work on today. I'm not sure what this is about. I have to admit, you're very persuasive, but, Listen. You hit the course today, if you still feel the same way by tomorrow, I'll leave you be, hmm? I'll be right out. Good. Make sure you wear your best golf clothes. If they still fit. Just consider this a dress rehearsal. We'll see. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, you don't have all your weight on your heels. Give me a minute, will you? Okay. Jeez. You know, you've come a long way in a short period of time, Joe. And that is just a true testament to how good you once were. But the question you gotta ask yourself right now is do I really want this? And I already know what the answer is. You lose your family, I'd like to see you get your head into this game. I know what's in your heart, Joe. We all believed in you. We? I still don't know who the hell you are. Can we get back to it? I'm a little sore. This girl I know took me to play yoga, work out yoga or whatever, I've never sweat so much in my life. Yoga, that's a little new age but I guess that'll help. All right. That was brilliant! That was brilliant. You're a little stiff, little stiff but that's not bad at all. A lot of stiff. That was good. Oh my god, beautiful! Girl, you know me. I used to be just like you. Constantly looking for the right relationship. But it seems like all the good men are already taken. And I've given up on that a long time ago. I'm a free spirit. And I love a variety of men. Even age-appropriate from time to time but that's mostly boring. Margo, you worry me sometimes. So, what about you? You should go out and date more. I'm telling you, it's invigorating. Well I'm interested in someone. Hmm, let me guess, Mr. Joe Bona? Well, yeah. You don't want that kind of baggage. What do you mean? He told me himself. I thought he was divorced. Murphy told me that he lost his wife and his two kids in a car accident. Oh my god. He just came to a yoga class with me the other day. He didn't say anything. You brought him here? Yeah. Are you serious? Jennifer. I received your check in the mail. Thank you so much, you're paid in full. Oh, okay, great, sure. That's strange. Yeah it's to the pin. It's currently 300 degrees. This is a very tricky shot. Hey Joe, did you golf today? Starting with all the questions again? Was it a good game? Nah, I couldn't get my groove on. I got an idea. What's your favorite thing to do? Well, I like dinosaurs. You can go. And this time you buy her dinner. Your grandmother's something else. Let me get my keys. I always wanted a brontosaurus burger. You okay? Yeah I'm fine. Do you know why that dinosaur's holding that egg? Oh, you're not gonna start with all the questions again, are you? No, I was quizzing you. That's an Oviraptor. How'd you know that? I'm gonna check that out. Right, it is an Oviraptor. Good job, kid. Let's go check out some more - over there. - Yeah. This is pretty cool, this place. Wow, look at all the different kinds. So cool. Yeah. Imagine if we were alive back then, they'd probably eat me for dinner. Wow, look at that one. That's crazy. Oh, little baby. Hi baby, how you doin', baby? Cool, man. Oh wow. Wow. Pretty colors here too. - So cool. - The size of that thing. Skeletons. It's the skeleton. Yeah. Look at that huh, wow. Cool, man. Wow. This place is phenomenal. I'm glad you took me here. Well I took you here. Oh, I'm gonna quiz you now. Okay. What's the guy with the long neck? That's a Diplodocus. But why does he have such a long neck? Eats plants and so it can reach it from the very top. Yeah, let's go look. What'd you call him again? Diplodocus. Oh yeah, look at that, it does eat the leaves off the trees. Eats trees, branches, look at all the green. Wow, you really do know your dinosaurs. - Yeah. - Let's go look at some more. Cool. I like this place. Yeah. This is fun. Oh, look at the little baby! Oh, wow. Wow. Look at that. You were great with those dinosaurs. I love dinosaurs. My father did too. So did my daughter. Look. I gotta use the restroom. Promise me you won't disappear. Pinky promise. Okay, I'll be right back. Okay, that went better. We gotta get going. It's been a long day today but tomorrow's gonna be even longer. Can I get another order of fries?

I can pick up a couple extra shifts. It's no big deal. Besides, you deserve it. Oh, that means so much to me. Let me put this away and go get a couple glasses. - Sounds good. - Have a seat. So everyone at the cafe is so proud of you. Murphy's been talking about you all day. Yeah, I may have had a little help. You know, being humble is a very attractive quality. Ah. Well then I'll have to remember about that. Listen. It was you who paid my bill to the yoga instructor, wasn't it? Just wanted to help, that's all. Oh my god, that's so incredibly sweet but I'm paying you back. Don't worry about it. Thank you. In that case, a toast. To the next Arizona Open champion. Ah. Jen? I need to tell you about my past. Mmm-mmm. I already know. And I have to tell you, I think what you're doing is incredible. Joe, I know a healing heart. I've been there. I made some mistakes along the line, but now, I feel incredible, unbeatable. It's getting hot in here. Ow, ow! What? Some people sleep with teddy bears, I sleep with golf clubs. Ah, okay. Yeah. It's been a long time. Ooh! I miss you guys. I didn't even get to say goodbye. I'm gonna follow your dreams. I'm gonna take my present and I'm gonna be a golfer. I'm gonna do it.

Who knew on Thursday that Joe Bona, He's got it. - I know it. - You got this, - Two Sugars. - Did you ever believe we'd ever be here? Who could possibly win the Arizona Open? Hit it out of the ballpark, Joe. Go Joe! Go Joe! You got this, buddy. You never really needed me. Yeah, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be here. You know what, I couldn't have done it without you.
