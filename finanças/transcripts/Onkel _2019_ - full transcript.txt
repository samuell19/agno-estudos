Nutella. Anything else? That'll be 262 kroner. Gleam. 6... 11... 21. You're doing fine. Call the vet. It's in the wrong position. Lucky you were there, otherwise it would have died. You would have made one hell of a vet. I think uncle's made coffee. Well, we're already awake, so what's the harm in a little caffeine. I'll be the one coming here from now on. Nils quit. Oh. Should we pay attention to anything? With the calf. No more than usual. I'm sure she'll be just fine. - Good thing she was there. - Yes, yes. I wouldn't mind having her as my assistant. - Here's the fodder. - Just leave it there. [TV news: Immigrants living under a highway bridge in Italy.] You're right. It's calf diphtheria. It's easily cured with a shot of penicillin. Are you going to the fair tonight? I don't think so. I just passed it. The dance tent and carousels are up. It goes on all weekend. - Are you done? - Yes, thanks for helping. You know Hanne from the marsh? I neutered her dog the other day. When we cut him open, the testicles popped up in the gash, and she fainted. She hit her head pretty bad, so we took her to the doctor. Wash your hands. Why can't you remember to wash your hands? - Is this pork from Christensen? - Mhm. I'm going to the fair tonight. You'll have to wash the tractor yourself. Sure, I can do that. Are you already done? I need to get ready. Kris! Kristine! - What's wrong with her this time? - Well, nothing really. Oh. Well, more time for coffee then. I'll have to take a rain check on that. - But tell Kris, the calf is doing fine. - Yep. - Bye. - Bye. There you are. It wasn't omphalitis. It was just a small hernia. Omphalitis is firm and tender... and can't be pushed back into the abdominal cavity I'm going to check your neighbour's pigs. Maybe you would like to join me? Yes. That's fine. Just take that one there. Yes. That's it. Now, let's see. Yes, yes, yes... no need to complain No need at all Easy now. Easy now. Yes, yes, yes... easy now. Everything's fine. Let's see the next one. - Don't put them all down. now. - There you are.. I think I will, though. Then you're left with only chickens. New assistant? - Yes, Kris from Stenbjerg - I see that. - How's your uncle? - Fine. Why doesn't he just sell the farm? He can't manage all that work. Kris is working hard. They're doing just fine. - Not, if she's here doing your job. - That's true. Kris actually got into veterinary school right after finishing high school. - But you'd rather be a farmer? - Yes. Kris... would you get the long gloves from the car? A peculiar girl. Well, things haven't been easy for her. No, it was a horrible way to lose her father. Yes, it wasn't fair of him. He never got over losing Joan. No... but he still had a daughter, for God's sake. - Would you catch that one for me? - I have to go. Yes, but... We'll be done in a minute. - I'll take you home. - No. I'm going now. Thank you. Uncle! There you are, I looked all over for you. I was in the cowshed. Okay, but I looked there as well. Johannes said the calf is fine. So, we don't have to call him anymore. It does cost a fair bit to have him come here. Strip the wires properly so they don't fall out. Let me do it. I've done it before, you know., Just let me do it. You didn't fix them properly! - That's not how you do it. - Just go away. We've overslept. It must be the first time we've overslept in about 12 years. Well, there's no harm in that. It's your father's birthday today. I've ordered the flowers. I thought we might go to the cemetery this afternoon. It's been a while. Do you want to put the flowers down? We need some water. Very good. - Mike, would you get the next songs? - Sure. Hi. Sorry, I'll get that. You can stay and listen. Well, I guess choir music isn't for everyone. We're rehearsing for the mass next Sunday. Mike, are you here to flirt or sing? Right, but I... was just inviting someone in who might like to... listen in. We must keep you on a short leash. Well, she seemed nice. HI there. If I park closer, could you wash my car as well? Sure, no problem. - But... we didn't call you. - No... I just wanted to ask Kris, if she wants to see a calf with omphalitis. I don't have time for that. Okay. But I have some veterinary books for you. I thought you might want to read them. Just leave them. Yes, well... I'll leave you to it, then. Maybe we should go to bed. So soon? I'm not feeling well. Oh. We need washing powder. Oh. Just wait here. I'll get it. - Puff pastry with different stuffings. - The other thing is earlier. Otherwise, we'll have to... Well, hi there. - Hi. - Hi. We're having a small marital crisis here, Stop your nonsense, Johannes. - How are you? - Fine. I'm reading the books, you gave me. Right now I'm on vaginal prolapse. I'm treating a cow with that tomorrow. Maybe you'd like to join me again? The appointment is at... 11:30am. So, I'll drive by your house at 11.20. If you want to come, just wait by the roadside. So... Maybe I'll see you tomorrow, then. Alright. Didn't we need washing powder? Uh, they're out. Oh. I'll be going out around lunch tomorrow. Oh. Where are you going? Johannes is taking me to see a cow with vaginal prolapse. I'd like to see that. I can go some other time. It doesn't need to be tomorrow. It's not that important. That's... That's up to you. Please sit up while you're eating. What? Sit up while you're eating or you'll choke on it. Sit up! Don't do the mucking out or clean the gutters. We'll do it later. And don't climb the ladder, when I'm not here. May I breathe? Uncle. And the rubble in the corner... just leave it. Yes. yes. - Shouldn't you be by the roadside now? - In 5 minutes. I'm going now. Be careful by the feeding trough, the boards are loose. Then half a meter of Buhner suture tape. If you just hold it there. Good. That's it. There. It must be so that you can fit 3 fingers in there. Otherwise it can't piss. Next case is a displaced abomasum. I'd better get back to uncle. I'm sure he's fine. He'll be enjoying not being bossed around. I don't boss him around. He must stay agile. You're right. I know. If you call to see he's alright, maybe you could come with me. But I don't have a phone. You don't have a cell phone? You must be the only woman in the world who doesn't have a cell phone. Hold on. Pick up. Pick up! Uncle? Are you okay? Yes., I was just taking a nap. - Alright! And you're fine? - Yes, yes. You didn't do anything you're not supposed to? No, no. Okay. Would it be okay, if I go with Johannes? He's treating a cow with a displaced abomasum. Sure, no problem. I'll be home for dinner. That'll be fine. And this one... you place into the abomasum. You remove this one and let the gas out. Then we'll place a suture to fixate the abomasum. I think we're ready. If you'll get some warm water and soap. Hi. Hi. - What... What are you doing here? - Uhm... I'm with the vet. Oh. Are you training to become a vet? No. We need some warm water and soap. You want to throw water in here as well? - Could you get us some warm water? - Sure. Here's... water and soap. Thank you. You're good at that. Feel free to visit me at church, if you want to listen to some music. But maybe you ran off, because it sounded awful. It sounded fine. - How was mass? - It was fine. We're rehearsing again on Wednesday. - Johannes, do you have the razor? - Yes. Here you go. We rehearse on Wednesdays. Yes, you said that. We're working now. - Alright. I just wanted... - Thanks for the water. Thanks for all your help today, Kris. Uncle? Hi. - Hi. - Did you eat? Yes, I was a little hungry, so I reheated some food. Sorry, I'm home so late. Well, did you have fun? What did you do? Nothing really. You made coffee. Yes, but it's a little weak. I'll have some bread. Do you want anything? Do you need to pee? No. I just can't keep my eyes open. I'm going to bed. Isn't it a bit early? Yes, but I'm tired. Sleep tight. I'll undress myself. - But you can't... - Yes, I can. - Sit down and eat your dinner. - I can eat afterwards. Kris. I can do it myself. Just sit down and eat. Well, it's no-oneÃ¢ÂÂs birthday today. Do you accept? Potpourri? Yes, a small bowl of dried flowers for the bathroom. What for? To... make the bathroom smell nicer or something. Okay. 4... 7... 9... 10... 11... 14... 15... 21... 24... 28. I'm going to the cemetery tomorrow. Oh, okay. I'll order some flowers, then. That's not necessary. I'm going alone. Oh. The car won't start. I'm taking the tractor. Right. So, you came to see me. I'm just here with some flowers. It's your parents who are buried here, right? I've also lost my mum. I was 10. Mine died when I was 14. You live with your uncle? Have you been to Ballum sluice? Yes, a long time ago. There's an inn. Okay. They serve food. For people who go there to eat. Yes. Maybe you'd like to... go there for dinner... with me? This Friday, or... if next week or next month is better Well, if you want to? I do. So... this Friday or next week? This Friday's fine. Do you think I'll be punished for asking you out in God's house? I think it'll be alright. So... the Nutella? Did you hide it somewhere? I also need a knife. Kris! Did you sleep well? I've slept just fine. - It's Friday tomorrow, right? - Mhm. Then we should go shopping. We could make... fried pork belly and have leftovers for Saturday. I'm going out to dinner tomorrow night. Oh. Where are you going? The inn at Ballum sluice. With Johannes? No. With someone named Mike, But I'm not sure. - DonÃ¢ÂÂt pretend to be asleep. - I'm not. I'm not sure, if I should go on that date. Well... it can't do any harm. Try again. So, you just heat this up in the oven. Or I can make something for you. No, no, this is fine. I can heat it for you, before I go. I can do that myself. - So, this one? - Yes. I think you should have one of these. But, I haven't used that kind of thing for years. You should have it. - Just the tips, okay? - Yes, yes, I got that. - No more than a centimetre. - No, no. I can't guarantee it'll be straight. Just do your best. It'll be fine. It's been a while, since I've been shearing sheep. Who are you calling a sheep? It looks very nice. - Hi. - Hi. - You look good. - Thank you. I was afraid you weren't coming. This is my uncle. - Hi. - Hi. It all looks delicious. - Yes. - Yes, it's edible. What are you having uncle? The Ballum sluice stew sounds good. I'm thinking the fish might be nice. Yeah, I'll have that too. - Do you want something to drink? - Yes, a beer would be nice. How about you? Should we have a glass of wine? I'm thinking a cola instead. Yeah, I'll have that too. - It's very nice here. - Yes. - You've been... - Yes, it's... - You've been here before? - No. No. My father wants me to take over the farm, but... I want to study environmental engineering in Copenhagen. He doesn't really understand that. He probably prefers to keep the farm in the family He's the fourth generation there, right? Yes. But... that's not what I want at all. No, no. You should do what you want. No one can force you to do anything. How about your parents? Were they also farmers? No. Well, my father was born into it, but he did something else entirely. So, how did you become a farmer? After... my father killed himself, I moved in with my uncle. I went to high school, Then... at the end of my third year, he had a stroke. and it was good I lived there, so I could help him keep the farm. And, well... Then I became a farmer. - It sure tastes good. - Yes. They're coming in now. Have you been out here before? It's beautiful. Have you never wanted to... move away from here? Like to Copenhagen? Yes, or... somewhere else. - You've never lived anywhere else, right? - No. But it's not that easy. We still have the dairy cows and the harvest every year. Well, I've had a good time, but it's easy in your company. Or in... both of your company. I like what you did with your hair, The curls. It looks good. Yes, well, I cut the tips. Okay. Well, thank you for tonight. Yes. Bye. Hi there. Hi. Well, here I am. Yep. - Hello. - Hello. Let's get started. Yes, let's go to the bedroom and take a look at it. - It mustn't hurt. - Oh. You're doing really good. That was the last one. Then stretch out. I'll hold here. Do you feel the tension? - Yes. - Yes. Tell me when the tension subsides. Are you feeling worse? Worse? No. Are you hurting anywhere? Why did you call that woman? It's just to do some exercises, so I don't wither away. But we're doing just fine. Yes, but one day you might want to do something else. Like what? I don't know... You're not going to stay here for the rest of your life are you? What are you doing? I'm setting the table. It's your birthday today. How did you get out of bed? Well... one leg at a time. Happy birthday. It's been a while since you helped out Johannes. Where did you get this? I stole it from Johannes' car, when he came here one day. It's not true. Johannes helped me find it. It's used, though. Can I try it on you? We've got 50 cows in the barn. Why don't you start there? Argh! Those things are always so cold. Inhale. - But couldn't you just... - Inhale. Again. And Again. And Again. Kris, I'm fine. Thank you. We went to the inn at Ballum sluice. It's a nice place. Have you seen him again? Here you go. It's for you. Why? Well, because it's your birthday. It's not a new one though. - It's very nice. - Good. I wanted to ask you, if you'd like to go to Copenhagen with me. I'm giving a lecture at the Veterinary University. I thought, you might like to see the place. It's a two-night stay.. We can't really leave the farm for that long. What if you uncle stays home, and Christensen helps out with the farm? I'm not sure that would work. I'm sure your uncle would be alright on his own for a few days. Now you can call him whenever you want. And if he gets a cell phone as well.. I'll think about it. Sounds good. But only for a couple of days. Then I'll... book two rooms for us, if you decide to come. To Copenhagen? Just for two nights. I thought, we might ask Christensen to take care of you in the meantime. Well.. I guess we could do that. But I think you should go on your own. But I'd like you to come. When did you last visit Copenhagen? I guess when I was about 15. It was a school trip. I went with mum and dad a long time ago. I don't really remember it. It's such a long trip, No, I don't want to go. But, I think you should go. By the way, Mike called a couple of days ago. Why didn't you tell me? I forgot. He also stopped by yesterday when you were out with Johannes. It's Kris. Yeah, I got a cell phone. Mhm. Can I have some popcorn? Look. I've boiled 2kg of potatoes for you. Here you have ham, kale sausage and creamed kale. I'll mash some potatoes in the kale in a minute. You can reheat it all. If the kale is a bit dry, you just add a little water from the ham. And this... is creamy peas, meatballs and pork rissoles. Creamed cabbage, casserole and potato soup. Are you going away for two weeks? What did we agree on? That Christensen will help out with the cows. And? I'm not supposed to do anything, I don't normally do. And? I must always have the cell phone with me and press the green button. I could stay home, you know. No. You should go and see everything. - Are you sure? - Yes, yes. Unbelievable. I thought young girls needed two or three suitcases. But it's only two nights? For a weekend trip with Elsa, the car is bursting at the seams. Sometimes I consider bringing the trailer. Please go inside. I just want to wave goodbye. - But it makes me uncomfortable. - Oh. Have a nice trip then. - I'll call you at 11.30am - Yep. This one's good. - Hi. - Hi. How's it going? - Fine, we ate raw fish. - Raw fish? That doesn't sound nice. And you? Did you eat? Yes, I had meatballs and creamed cabbage. Was Christensen sufficient help today? Yes, it was fine. Good. He's coming again tomorrow, right? Yes, he'll help out for a couple of hours. Why only for a couple of hours? I believe he needs to be somewhere. Don't start doing things on your own okay? No, no. - Are you lying down? - No. I'm not. Look, siamese piglets. Yes, they probably didn't live long. - Thoracogastropagus disymmetros. - Yes, well... They know their Latin, don't they? This is where I'll make a bunch of youngsters fall asleep. Kris. You can sit there. Okay. - I just need to call my uncle first. - Yes. - Kris, we're starting now. - But he doesn't answer. He probably just left the phone inside. He'll call. You'll see. But we're supposed to talk now. I need to start my lecture now. Can't you just... Can't you call Elsa and ask her to check up on him? Okay. Hi, it's me. Are you at home? Good. Would you go to Stenbjerg and check on Kris's uncle? He's not answering the phone. Probably, but she's a bit upset, so if you wouldn't mind? That's good. Yes. Bye. She's going there now. She'll call you back. This is her number. Kris, everything's fine. You can just sneak in, when you're ready. Elsa? Hi. Mhm. Where is he now, then? Where is he now? Where is he? Is he alive? You can't keep an eye on him all the time. Have you been drinking? Yes, I went out with some friends yesterday. I didn't catch much sleep. Sorry, if I reek of alcohol. You can't look after him forever. - You have your own life, and... - How do you know! I just... Can't you just leave me alone? And down there. That's good. I slipped in the muck. How was Copenhagen? Did you like it? No. Hello! Anybody home? Retirement. "I" and "N" are missing. Not accepted. - What are you doing here? - I'm just looking. No. Kris. - Kris! - What don't you get? - I just... - What is it you want? Nutella?
