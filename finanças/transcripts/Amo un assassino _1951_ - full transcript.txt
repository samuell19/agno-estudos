[I LOVE A KILLER] What happened? Who has fallen? Oh my God! - Who is it? - I don't know. Who has fallen? - Has he committed suicide? - She's dead! Silvia, what happened? - Good heavens! Mrs Rossini, who is it? - I don't know. It is not from the community. - What is it? - What happened? I'll see. She is dead! All still! Don't touch anything! But, commander ... - I'll take care. - What are you going to do? D�jeme a m�, se�ora. Ni os, at home! Why don't we do something? We are not going to stare! You, why have you killed this woman? Are you an idiot? He's thrown down the stairwell! So are you claiming it is suicide? What about me? Someone call the police! I'm coming. �D�nde? Via della Giuliana, 58. Very well. Who am I talking to? Your phone number? Yes, wait by the appliance. Now I call you. - What is it? - A deceased. Here, work. Take it to the commissary. He's not here, he's gone out. Swedes, Paraguayans, Turks ... What Italian teams are these? Well, Milan has won the cup on behalf of the Swedes. - I would have quit. - Okay, always with the same story! - Damn it! - Does "the file" work again? What file ?! Via Giuliana 58. It is the house of Pietrangeli. Mariani, Fri. Go to Fornaci, the commissioner must be there investigating a case. Give him this note and tell him that I am getting ahead of myself. Come on! And you young man, remember that there is a perfect file in here! One thousand three hundred and seventy investigations in twenty-five years of career! What a shame! Nobody wanted to give a sheet. And why don't you give it? And what do I have to do with it! Also, no one has asked me for it. Can we clear it, please? Come on, gentlemen. Go home. There is nothing to see here. Sergeant, what does the file say? What file or what file! It will be the same as what happened three years ago in Tiburtino ... Suicide... Here, go search his house. All right, sergeant. With your permission! Make way! - Commissioner ... - Palermo, what happened? - Good afternoon, Commissioner. - Pietrangeli has arrived! It's the commissary of the room! - Hello, Commissioner. - Good morning, Commissioner. Silvia, hi! - Are you running the investigation, Commissioner? - Yes, but go home. - Come on, clear the stairs. - Evict, please, gentlemen. Please, gentlemen, vacate! Come on, clear out. So, Palermo ... What do we have? The identity card is in the name of Magda Fiorelli, a housewife. - Where was he going when the events occurred? - No one has seen her. They heard the cry when it fell. I found this piece of dress caught on the railing. He must have dropped off the fourth floor. From the room? From my landing? His daughter. �Ah, Silvia! -Why did you go out? Go back home. - Yes, dad. - How pale you are! Are you ill? - No, now I'm going. Giorgio? Do me a favor, take Silvia upstairs. With great pleasure. - Now I'll go up. Go home, come on. - Yes. - So from the fourth floor. - Suicide! - How do you deduce that? - You don't remember three years ago in Tiburtino? S�, s�... - Has no one seen her before she died? - Yes, a certain Rosani. - Rosini? The second. - Yes. And so is this man. Hey you! - Do you tell me? - Pietrangeli, be careful, because he is the murderer. Do you realize? Tell them to let me pass. Take it easy, Commander, if he's the murderer, I'll take care of him. Ahead. Go ahead, "cavaliere", I trust you. What a slap in the face! - Is not my bussiness. - Waiting. I don't think it has anything to do with it either, but it was next to the corpse. - I was going to the house of a certain Leprotti. - Be quiet. - Leprotti says it's not true. - How not ?! - Okay, let's check it out. - Let's go. "Cavaliere", �quiere interrogar a Leprotti? That's it. Look, Leprotti hasn't called anyone. - How? - Now we will see. - Leprotti! - Excuse me. Good afternoon, Commissioner. - Have you called this man? - I do not. What is the death? - Commissioner, can I speak to you? - I talked. Please allow a moment? Just a little while. Excuse me �Carmela! �Fuera! Commissioner, I have something to confess to you. It's about my reputation, you understand me. - While I could, I killed them by myself, but then ... - Who has he killed ?! Bed bugs, Commissioner! - And you're wasting my time with this? - I'd like to see you in my place! I have found the black bed. Come see! No, leave it. Never mind. And then I called that man, the fumigator. But it's not for everyone to know that the house is full of bed bugs. You have to help me, Commissioner. You can't tell anyone. Quiet. No one will know. - Thank you, thank you! - No, no! I want to help you. I'll give you a revelation. Get down, Commissioner. Drop it to the ground. - Marzocchi has a mistress. - Marzocchi? - My wife has seen them together. - So what? My wife recognized her. The dead woman is Marzocchi's mistress. - Are you sure? - I'm calling my wife. No, no! We will see. - Bye bye. - Don't tell anyone about bed bugs. - No one will know. - Thank you, Commissioner. Leave ... bye bye. �Palermo? Avise to the "commendator" Marzocchi, of the cuarto piso. - You can go. - Thanks. - They will call you to take a statement. - Of course. - �Fan�tico! - �Maleducado! �L�rgate! "Cavaliere", �c�mo no lo detiene? D�jeme a m�. I understand. Let him go to keep him going. - He's part of a band. - Yes ... From the band of "los chincheros". Good afternoon, Pietrangeli. Was he looking for me? "Commendator" Marzocchi, good afternoon. - Come on come on. - Here I am. - You wanted to talk to me? I am at your disposal. - Yes. Tell me, how can I be of use to you? "Commendatore", do you have a mistress? I missed that hint. You have known me for a long time. - You know perfectly well who I am. - For that very reason. Exactly. Some say that the poor thing on the ladder is his lover. No, that's not it. Is another. I called her a quarter of an hour ago. If you want his address ... Mariella is at home alive and well. - What's his name? - Mariella. Mariella Rossi. - D nde alive? - Via Calamatta ... Via Calamatta, 12. - It's a little apartment that I ... - I understand. - Exactly. - Tel�fono... Tel�fono. - 39... 39-22-14. - Let no one find out because ... - Okay, we'll check. No, because everyone knows me here, you know? - Nobody knows anything. - Thanks. - Quiet. - Easy ... How easy to say! - Have you questioned this one? - No, not this one. It could be a client of yours. A creature of love. Love has dragged her to death. She wanted to die ... Poor creature! Everything is clear! Queen of Spades, Ace of Clubs, Jack of Hearts. I see everything. I "say" everything. Disgrace! Violent death! - Good afternoon, ladies. - Good afternoon, Commissioner. I swear I was looking forward to your visit. Today has been a day full of foreboding signs. The queen of spades has always come out. Someone had to die. - This is Mrs. Rosani. - Rosini. What do you tell us, ma'am? What do you want me to tell you! The usual, unfortunately. - Haven't you seen that poor thing go up? - Oh yeah. I was cleaning the landing, because it is always dirty ... ��Sucio?! - Because you say so! Sudo blood! - Well, it's always dirty. �Y...? I was sweeping the landing when I saw that woman go up. I asked him where he was going, but he didn't answer me. It seems that he was in a great hurry and has continued to climb. Y...? And since I never meddle in other people's business, I've gotten into my house. Enough with that, thanks. - Your affiliation ... - What for? What is missing? Tomorrow you have to come to the police station. It is a drag but you have to do the report. Excuse me ... Fosca, have you seen that girl when you came in? No the truth is no. So, as usual, he was not in the goal. I have gone out for a moment to visit a sick friend. OK OK... - So you don't know anything and you haven't seen anything. - No, nothing. - What about you, ma'am? - I? - Was he a client of yours? - Oh no! No "my customer"! After my sessions, no one wants to commit suicide. Your future "be happy". That's it! Nobody wants to hear unpleasant things. I mean, you can't tell me anything. Oh yeah! I can say". That poor girl, "committed suicide for love." Letters "do not lie". "Excuse me." Should I also give my name "Sergeant"? Yes, to Sgt. All tenants have to declare. But I am "not an Italian citizen". I "Romanian citizen". I'm sorry, but we'll have to upset her anyway. - Good afternoon, ladies. - Good afternoon, Commissioner Pietrangeli. - Palermo, I'm going upstairs - Now I'm meeting you. What's your name, ma'am? No, it cannot be kept secret. What is it called? Margherita Soap. But wasn't his name Topescu? Born in... In Cosenza. - Ah, are you Pietrangeli? - Buenas tardes. Is Silvia with you? - Yes, did I call her? - No, tell him you'll be busy for a while yet. What things happen, eh! Silvia is very impressed. I have noticed it too. Poor thing! - When you're not used to ... - Commissioner? Excuse me, ma'am, I'm going back to work. Thanks for Silvia. - I'll be missing more! Goodbye, Pietrangeli. - Buenas tardes. The "Professor Topescu" was born in Cosenza and her name is Margherita Sapone. Qu lianta! Palermo, if you think I would like to clarify a case in my building ... I see ... There will be a lot of gossip. - The depot have arrived. - Okay, we wait for the judge. Palermo, where did you find the piece of the deceased's dress? Aqu�. - What was broken? - The skirt, on the left side. - Palermo, it hasn't fallen from here. - No? Look at this sign on the iron. - Let's see on the fifth floor. - Yes. Do you see it? It has fallen from here. And here, who lives? Damn! Let's hope they haven't heard. �Por qu�? Good afternoon, Commissioner. Did you want something? I wanted to know if you heard a scream on the stairs. - A little "brine"? - The ladder! Now I bring it to you. If we don't help each other between neighbors ... �Oiga! There is nothing to do! You are deaf than a wall! - Do you live alone? - With his wife. - Well, we asked his wife. - She is deaf than him. - The brine ... Do you want something else? Best regards to your daughter. - Voucher. - Give it back to me? Don't even think about it! - No, u ... Here, I'll give it to you. What do I do with this? - And there, who lives? - Salemi. No ... The Salemi's long gone. - He's that tall young man ... What's his name? - And how do you want me to know? - Manni. If llama Manni. - No ser tambi n deaf! No, I won't be home. I think he lives alone. - Commissioner, the judge has arrived. - Okay, let's go. Thanks, Giorgio. See you later. Palermo, if Manni arrives, we will question him immediately. Vale. - In any case, book it for tomorrow. - Yes. - Silvia, are you going home now? - Is it that you are not coming? No, I go down a moment and now I go up. - Okay, daddy. - Can I go too? - What for? - To take a look. If you're interested ... Come on. The body is in a supine position. The right arm glued to the side. There are no signs of violence or struggle ... Except for a slight erosion on the right wrist. - Good afternoon, judge. - Good afternoon, Commissioner. - I'm done. - Me too. Nothing else is detected and, therefore, it is ordered ... the lifting of the corpse. Rome, July 5, 1951. In your opinion, Commissioner, what was it? A suicide? I think so, but I still can't be sure. Why kill yourself? Life is so beautiful! Good research, Commissioner. And until next time. See you later. - Can I go? - Yes, but hurry up with the photos. - Consider it done. Buenas tardes. - Bye. Tell Dr. Silenti that I await his report tomorrow. Is good. Commissioner, did you want to speak to me? - You're Manni, right? - Yes. One moment. Do you know this woman? Yes ... She is my wife. Llev�osla. Can we continue this conversation at your house? - Okay. - Please... - Such a blameless young man! - I dislike him. He never says hello. Who would have guessed it! - There is a murderer in this building. - I already said he was a murderer. - Who is this Manni? - That tall young man. He was hardly ever seen! Come in, commissioner. Among. - Silvia, I have to talk to you. - What for? - Let me in. - Silvia, have you gone crazy? - Why? I have seen you when you went up the stairs and I have also seen you in the courtyard. �Y qu�? Fear not, I will say nothing. But you could have seen another. And then, how would you have justified yourself? What do I care about the others! It's not about the others, it's about him. He's a murder suspect. Have they said it? Did they say it was a homicide? Why don't you trust me? You know that I have always loved you like a sister. We have been friends almost since we were born. I'm not going to blame you for anything. I just want to help you. Aldo Manni is suspected of having killed his wife and if it were known that lyt ... - What do you mean? - Any. I would not like you to be compromised and I want to avoid annoying your father. - Why don't you tell me everything? - No. I can't ... I can't! As you like... But I want you to know that only yours with Aldo for a long time. And that, although it does not justify it, I have never said anything. Thanks, Giorgio. - I'm desperate! - Try to calm down. Your father must know nothing. And you can entrust yourself to me. Many times knowing things in time solves everything, you know? Okay, Silvia? Everything you have told me does not explain what happened today. So, Commissioner, this is an interrogation. S�. About the death of his wife. Please continue. When I got out of jail ... in 1946 ... They had bombed the house we lived in. There was no news from Magda. After a while, I knew I was alive ... - And who lived with someone else. - Ah! Were they legally separated? - No, she didn't. - Why? I don't know. What was your relationship with her? I didn't see her for quite a while, but she reappeared a few months ago. - Did he live with you again? - No, it was no longer possible. Why? Aim ... It was another woman ... She was only interested in money. - And you, did you give it to him? - Yes, he was blackmailing me. Nerd... No, "blackmail" is not the word. What have you done today at noon? I left around three. I have collected the mail at the gate. - Has anyone seen him? - The concierge. And you have seen me come back. Anything else? According to you, why would your wife have committed suicide? Whenever he needed money and I didn't give it to him, He threatened to kill himself. - His letters always ended like this. - Do you have those letters? No, he always threw them away. But you had stopped giving in to their requests. Yes, I had promised to pass him a monthly amount, only if he accepted legal separation. There's another woman, huh? No, Commissioner, you are wrong. Mire, Manni ... Fosca, have you seen Mr. Manni at noon today? - Yes, when it came out. - What time? - It would be three. - What time did you come back? I have not seen him. He's going to get into trouble for never being in goal. You're right, Commissioner, but Mr. Manni He told me he was not coming back. I handed him a letter and he read it. He seemed very concerned. Then he told me: "If someone comes looking for me, I'm not here." He even forgot to leave me the keys, like he does every day ... Because I do the cleaning. - You haven't left him the keys? - No, not today. - What about the rest? - Always. - Enough for now, Fosca. You can go. - Good morning, Commissioner. Anyway, Manni, you have received another letter from your wife today. - Yes. - Has he thrown it away? - No. - �Puede d�rmela? - It's like the others. - Yes, yes. She also threatened to commit suicide if she did not speak to you. But this one has not thrown it away. Maybe because he said he was coming just today ... here. Ver , Manni ... You told the concierge that you were not coming back. And he has not left her the keys, as he usually does. Yet he has returned, he has received his wife, he has murdered her and she has come out again. It is not true! How can you believe that? - I examine the facts. - Where do you want to go? For now, nowhere. I just know that his wife was blackmailing him. - I have never said that. - He did. I asked him what he had done today and he told me he was out. Almost nothing. Under these conditions, I am forced to arrest him. No, he wasn't here at noon. It wasn't here. - Where was he? - At Caf Moderno, in Via Flaminia. Four to six thirty. - With the other one? - There is no other! Look, Manni, I understand that you do not want to mix it up in this story, but when you love, you want to be free at any cost. Let's go. You can't stop me! Someone must have seen me at the Cafe. The waiter, the cashier ... You can check it out now. It's okay, it's your right. Check his alibi. - What if it's fake? - The usual. I will be glad someone saw him and be able to think about suicide again. -Please, clear the stairs? - Good afternoon, Commissioner. - Dad ... - How did it go? - Everything solved. - Come on, Silvia? Goodbye, Giorgio. - Good afternoon, Commissioner. Leave it, Silvia, please! You don't like it? - No coffee tonight? - Now I bring it to you. Silvia, what do you have today? - Excuse me, dad. I do not feel well. - Let's see, what's wrong with you? - Any. I assure you, dad. - I do not believe you. Is it what happened today? - Do you think he's guilty? - Manni? I don't know. There is another woman involved and women are always a fuck in these cases. Anyway, we don't care. Also, you know that at home I don't like to talk about these things. And a man is stopped right off the bat? No, I stopped it while we ran some checks. - Then there is hope. - Yes, yes. He says he has an alibi. If you can try it ... What if not? Thirty years nobody takes them away. So you think it was him. - You were impressed by this matter. - I want to know if you think he's guilty. My daughter, there are only two options ... Either he has killed her or she has thrown herself out of desperation. Either way, it's a dirty case. �Diga? Who is it? Speak louder. - Ah, Palermo ... Tell me. - Any. I've made inquiries and the alibi is bogus. Okay. See you tomorrow. Agree. You want me to question Manni? Yes, question him, let him sign the statement and I'll take care of it tomorrow. Adi�s. - What is it? What are you going to do to him? - You don't have to take it that way either. - He's innocent, I'm sure. - His alibi turned out to be false. It had to be false. - Why? - He made it up to save me. �Por qu�? At noon he was here with me. With you? What are you saying? Why are you defending that man? Answer! Because I love him! Aldo is not a murderer! I can scream at the whole world that I was with him! I must save him and I will save him! And business over! With two words? Debes save him! Does that only matter to you? What do you care about your honor! Your father's honor ... Tomorrow everyone will know that my daughter is not ashamed, but you do not care. You must save it! That's the only thing that matters to you. S�, pap�. Silvia... What happened between lyt ... I don't want to judge him now. But if you do it just to save him, it's still time. Pi�nsalo. I said the truth. I am his alibi. You have to release it immediately. Silvia... I can't handle this case. They will pass it on to someone else. They will question you. We will both be involved! Pap�... - Can't you understand me? - At least shut up. �C�llate! �Manni? Let's go. Pass. His alibi has turned out to be false. I'm innocent. Someone must have seen me at the Cafe. Nobody saw him, he knows better than I do. He was never in that café. What is your relationship with my daughter? I don't understand him. Lea. With this report my investigation concludes. What do you have to add? - Is not true. - What is not true? You don't know my daughter and you weren't with her at my house yesterday? - I know Silvia. - So, I was with her! No! Is not true. Silvia has lied. - Let's see who is more generous! - I swear it's not true. - I wasn't with Silvia. - I'll take care of Silvia. Even though he got her involved in this filthy affair. It will be someone else who will judge whether the alibi my daughter provides is enough. I won't lift a finger to save you. You will have the destiny you deserve. I understand what you're trying to do, Commissioner, but I swear to you ... Enough! My personal reasons don't matter here. The investigation will go to Central. �Ll�vatelo! Put me with the guard court, with Judge De Vincenzi. - What do you want? - There are the cashier and the waiter. - Manni told the truth. He was at the Cafe. - Are you sure? I have already confirmed it. Hey? This is Pietrangeli speaking. I'm calling about the Via della Giuliana matter. Yes, I saw the report last night. What happens? I wanted you to intervene ... But at this moment Palermo brings new evidence that must be verified. - Okay. If you need me, call me. - Agree. Buenos d�as. - Where are they? - We are taking their statement. Let's go. I'm tired ... Mr. Pietrangeli, we've been waiting for two hours. S�... Buenos d�as, se�ora. Buenos d�as. You claim that Manni stayed at the Cafe between 4:30 PM and 6:00 PM on the 5th. - Yes. - What about you? - Also. - Yesterday I said otherwise. - ls . I already said I didn't remember. With so many people ... - But today I do remember. - It was her. - I questioned her. It is exact. - Let her talk. When they came yesterday I was finished, but this morning I remembered everything. Why did you notice him? He was a handsome, tall young man. It was right in front of the box. - �Sali�? - No. - How long did he stay? - Two hours, from 4:30 p.m. to ... I've done all the checks. Manni was at the bar from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM. Well. Let them sign it. You can go. - Good morning, Commissioner. - Good morning. - The other statements? - They're ready. The sergeant's search at Fiorelli's house? Nothing special. She was a dancer and ... she wasn't doing well. You've committed suicide out of desperation, Commissioner. I always said it. - Yes. - As in the Tiburtino. He's kept his word, poor thing. And I believed that Manni kept this letter to have proof in his favor. Well, Palermo ... Close the case and let's forget about it. And let Manni go free. - �Hola? - �Eres t�, Silvia? - Aldo! - I just left. Everything is over. - Are you free? - Yes, I'm free. - I'm going immediately. Where are you? - At home. - I'm going right now. - No, we better meet later. No it does not matter. I'm going right now �S�! Aldo... - You shouldn't have come, dear. - I don't care about anything anymore. I was so afraid of losing you. Why? Everything has been resolved. I'm scared, Aldo! Silvia, I'll talk to your father. You don't know him ... I won't listen to you. Convince him , love hand! - It may take time, but ... - It's not just my father. I do not regret anything. I've known you for two years and have always loved you. - But I'm afraid we can't be happy. - Why do you say that? No, don't interrupt me! Yesterday your wife called me and said she wanted to talk to me. - �Magda? - S�. That is why he did not attend our appointment at the Café. When it came down, I had a feeling. Do not think about it anymore. Everything is over. Do you see it, Silvia? Your father was right when he suspected me. I'm not ashamed to say it. I've thought so many times that if Magda disappeared ... Yes, Silvia. It is useless to deny it. That is why we cannot be happy. Besides, I have to tell you something else. Aldo ... No, Silvia, not now. Now we have to think about ourselves. It is the fairest thing. And you have to talk to your father. Promise me. - Can you promise me? - As you like. �Silvia? Silvia, �eres t�? Silvia... What you told me last night ... Dad, I said it because I love him. He didn't want you to stop him. Come, Silvia. I have to talk to you. Silvia, you have to forget that man. Why, dad? I love him, I already told you. He was married! What did you expect from him? And what could he offer a good girl like you? Do not say that. You are unfair, you don't know him. Listen to me, Silvia ... I don't know him, it's true. But I'm going to tell you this so that you understand what kind of man he is ... He knew his wife would kill herself if she couldn't find him. And he left. This is your Aldo! It's not like that, Daddy. For me it is as if he had killed her himself. With your own hands! You love a murderer. You can say what you want ... You won't separate me from him! �Silvia! Silvia... What more do you want? Silvia... I know that saying this caused you great pain ... But trust me, for your sake. It's useless, daddy. I love him and believe in him. That is why I agreed to love him even though he was married. I forbid you to see it again! I'll keep seeing him, even if it's against your will. Ah, �s�? Then you won't see it anymore. The law also punishes the instigation of suicide! Come on what ...! What didn't happen to me! Good morning, Commissioner. Commissar... - Commissioner, I wanted to speak to you. - I have no time. - Here, look. I found her in Mr. Manni's apartment. - When did you find it? - This morning, when doing the cleaning. It puts Magda, Magda Fiorelli. Isn't that the name of the deceased? I have assumed you would be interested. It's something important, right? Yeah ... sure. - Come make a statement in writing. - A statement? What statement? And what do I have to do with it! - Do you know if Manni is at home? - Yes, it must be there yet. But he doesn't know anything. I waited for you to come out to tell him. - Have I done well? - Of course. - Let's go. - Where are you taking me? - To Manni's. - What for? What do I have to see? �Vamos! Good morning, Commissioner. I was looking forward to your visit. Ahead. Happens. �Pase! - The truth is that I did not want ... - Shut up! Where did you find it? Here, right here. Excuse me, Commissioner, what's up? - What? - Do you recognize her? Yes, it is the bracelet that my wife always wore on her wrist. - You can go. - Yes, Commissioner. Buenas tardes. Where is the rest of the bracelet? I don't know. The last time I saw her she was wearing it. He always wore it. Didn't I return it? No. Was your wife here? �No! This proves the opposite. I don't understand it, I assure you. Are you sure you've told me the whole truth? I've even told you what I shouldn't have told you. That's what makes me suspect he's hiding something from me. Are you going to stop me again? Describe to me the missing piece of bracelet. On the other piece of the chain there was another plate. It had written: "United forever." A promise he has kept. It wasn't my fault. �Ya! It was not his fault. But Magda Fiorelli has been murdered! - Murdered ?! - Don't be naive! Magda Fiorelli entered this house and was murdered. - It's not possible. - The investigation will be reopened. We will check again each one of his movements, his words. - It must be at our disposal. - And Silvia? I don't want to hear you talk about my daughter again, I already told you. The best thing is that you stay away from your life ... and mine. You can think of me what you want. I do not mind... But Silvia should not be involved in this story. I won't be able to do anything. It can be considered an accomplice. Why doesn't he say directly that she killed her? And do you have the courage to tell me? Yes, because Silvia has done stupid things that can compromise her. - What do you mean? - Silvia knew Magda. He wanted to meet her and Magda took the opportunity to ask for more money. Yesterday Magda phoned her to let her know that she was coming to see me. - Did Silvia see her? - No! Magda was murdered before. Is good. I'll tell you when they question him. Now follow me. I will never pronounce Silvia's name. Let's go. The photograph is very clear. There is nothing special. But it is evident that the girl fell from very high. The position of the corpse does not indicate anything in particular. It cannot be excluded that the woman was thrown down the stairwell. Certain. There could have been a scuffle at Manni's house. It seems that there are many things to clarify. Manni's last questioning is negative. His alibi is beyond reproach. The girl, whose existence he denies, must be found and interrogated. - Don't you think? - Yes, of course. Well, Pietrangeli, it's up to you. - Yeah, but ... - Keep me updated on your progress. - Buenos d�as, se�or. - Adi�s. - Let's go. - Good morning. Commissioner, it would be enough to find the one with the bracelet and the matter resolved. - The woman does not convince me. - Who? Manni's lover. Too many mysteries. Why doesn't Manni want to tell us his name? - It may have nothing to do with it. - Or that she's stuck to the bottom. In any case, you have to start from the beginning. - We will divide the work. - With this heat we are going to die. Let's go. I don't know ... After the fall I seemed to hear a door closing. - What floor? - It's hard to say. - It could also be a door that was opening. - Why do you say so? When I looked up, I saw a blonde girl in the room. I was terrified. - You never came here? - No. Manni is very reserved. I know about the existence of this woman because she phoned from time to time. But he never brought it to the office. Did you call the day before yesterday? No s�. Urbani, friend! Did someone call Manni the day before yesterday? Yes, his girlfriend called him a couple of times. It looks like I needed to talk to him. I was looking for it with great insistence. Yes, I know the Fiorelli well. For a long time? Yes, I was working here until a few days ago. - What can you tell me about her? - Any. One like the others, always with them. One day a woman came here ... - Did you see her? - What if I saw her? I heard her! They argued like condemned. It must be because of Magda's husband. - What did they say? - Who remembers! They threatened ... Giorgio,... I have called you because you can enlighten me on many things. Conoces well in Manni? No, just to say hello. I have never liked it. - Why? What do you know about him? - Nothing concrete. It's an impression ... - Do you know anything about her private life? - I? No ... I dislike him. Giorgio, if you know something, tell me. Any clue can be precious. I have to know the truth. I don't want to meddle in this matter. Don't make me talk. Deep down, I don't know anything. - Silvia ... - Have you seen them together? - Only once, but I don't know if I should say it. - You must tell me everything. It was before Manni recognized the corpse. Silvia went up the stairs, went through the terrace, and I saw her talking to him in the yard. I understand... Then I spoke with Silvia. - What did he tell you? - I defended him. She said she was sure of her innocence and that she knew it couldn't have been him. And on what was that security based? Women, when they love ... Here's my part. - Have you questioned everyone? - Nothing new. Uff, how hot! It must be exhausting to do research. - Especially if it's 1317! - Wow! And to think that to a layman like me everything seems very simple! A dead woman, a husband who does not love her ... - And the alibi? - Have you returned to the Cafe? Yes, Commissioner. This is the third time we've checked the alibi. I have done all the possible laps with the waiter and the cashier. And you know what I have discovered? That there was another witness. It's useless, Commissioner. It wasn't him. But I want to question him! I want you to tell me who that woman is, because ... - You, Giorgio, you can go. - Okay. - Good morning. Good morning, sergeant. - Good morning. I have questioned all the neighbors and none of them know that Manni had a mistress. - Well, Palermo, I'm going. - Haven't we finished looking at the file? No, Palermo. There is one thing I must confess ... It may be easier for me to get the neighbors to talk. �Silvia? �Silvia! Silvia? �Giorgio! - Good afternoon, Commissioner. - Waiting. S�. Where is Silvia? You know it. I don't know, Commissioner. I just know they're gone. - I spoke with Silvia a while ago. - What did he tell you? That he had to go. "That he had to go" ... I understand. Here I am. Anything new? I believe I have identified the woman Manni wanted to hide. Who is it? Look, Palermo, this is something very special. - I want to know what you think. - Tell me. It was she herself who revealed to me her relationship with Manni before the piece of the bracelet was found at his house. You will question her later. - I have known many other things. - Like what? Keep a quote with Fiorelli justo aquel d a. And he has not been able to prove where he was at the time of the crime. No, he couldn't. And you haven't stopped her? Is this enough for you to consider her guilty? At the very least, highly suspicious. And yet ... If I hadn't discovered the proof ... Is there also a test? Then everything is clear. The two women meet, they fight and she kills her. But it might not have been. It could be that the women had not met. But there is no proof. Also, how come no neighbor has seen it? Live in the building. Then there is no doubt. It must be stopped. It can not. Has run away. These occasional criminals never go very far. You said there is a test. It won't be difficult to make her confess. S�... I found the other piece of the Fiorelli bracelet in your room. Wow! Good service, Commissioner! Give me your affiliation and in twenty-four hours you have her here in handcuffs. Well... Here you go, Palermo. It's my resignation. After so many years ... the time has come to part. Please deliver it to you tomorrow morning. The girl we were talking about ... She is my daughter! What do we do? It was crazy. We have fled like two criminals. And that Morelli had to meddle! Giorgio, you've done it for my good. Yes, for your sake. And in the meantime, your father ... Always my father! You never think of me. What will people say? What will my father say? You only think about that. I think of you Silvia ... In our future. You have wanted to escape and I have followed you, but I can tell you that it is crazy. That! Our entire relationship has been crazy! Go where you want. I can manage on my own perfectly. �Silvia! What an idiot I have been! He should not have escaped. I would like to have seen you when the neighbors found out the truth. The distinguished and honest Miss Pietrangeli ... She's going to have a child! Silvia... Why didn't you tell me? Is that why you wanted to come here? Were you afraid to tell me? To tell your father? �Silvia! �Amor m�o! Now you will have to agree with me when I say that we were wrong to flee. No, Silvia. Now we will do what I say. I'll go see your father and explain everything to him. I'm sure you will understand. And you still have the courage to show up here ?! �D�nde est� Silvia? That is why I have come. We need your forgiveness. �Perd�n? ��Perd�n?! After he has pushed her to kill his wife? - What does it say? - Me... I have denounced Silvia! - Have you reported her? Are you crazy? - Where is Silvia? Where have you taken it? Silvia is innocent! You have learned your role well! Esc�cheme... Even if you have reported it now you must ... �Basta! �Basta! You are no one to tell me what to do with my daughter. Where is it? Are you feeling down? Okay, come on. He is in the Flaminia Pension. In the Flaminia Pension? Who are you? �Desde d�nde llama? �Pap�! He has denounced you. For Magda's death. - Denounced ?! - I couldn't do anything else! ��C�mo?! - You have to surrender. - But what have you done? I went home to question you ... To convince me of your innocence. But you were gone. You had fled. Do you want to know why I ran away? I am expecting a son! And I was afraid to tell you. A son... This aggravates your situation. It could be another piece of evidence against you. Are you talking about tests after what Silvia told you? It's the evidence that speaks! I found the Fiorelli bracelet in your bag. What bracelet? I have never seen that bracelet. I found it in your bedroom! And do you think that I ...? That I have killed her? �Es horrible! How could I convince you? It wasn't me! I swear to you! I swear it on my son. Silvia... �Silvia! Do your duty, Palermo! I think. I believe you! And. Listen, Palermo ... You have to help me. I have spoken to her. I am convinced of his innocence. Even if I have no evidence to prove it. If you are not guilty ... Nor is it for me. Silvia had never seen the Fiorelli bracelet. I have to find whoever put her in her bedroom to frame her, you understand? But who could it have been? Who? - The call! - What call? In which they said to come here. - We got it, Palermo! - Anonymous. - Man or woman? - Man. You don't know where he was calling from? Any hint ... Any clue! No. It sounded bad. There was a lot of noise. A public telephone. Let's see who is the handsome one who locates him! One moment! An orchestra was playing and a woman was singing. That song that everyone sings ... - Yes, that was singing. - It's a clue, Palermo! - What time did they call? - A quarter of an hour ago. - At midnight? - Yes. You have to find the place where they played that song. Come on! - Yes. - What time did they play it? - What? - Contest. Can you find out what they want? �Polic�a! �Qu�? It is the song of Vandina. He usually sings it at midnight. - Is there a telephone near the orchestra? - Near. The one with the wardrobe ... No, it's too far away. Mo would be heard. - Maybe the one in the dressing rooms. - Come on! Wait ... Easy. Quickly. Aqu� est�. - Who has the chips? - Giovanna ... The police. What do they want? - Do you have the phone numbers? - Oh yeah. Pay attention. Last night ... what's his name? Vandina. As Vandina sang her number, who did you give tokens to? Me? To nobody. - Are you sure? - I'm not an idiot. I remember perfectly. - Were you here? Didn't you move? - I didn't move from here. Are you sure that while Vandina was singing, no one called from here? - I do not. - Why? I called one, but I didn't give him the token. - Who was it? - I don't know what it's called. - But do you know him? - Yes. It's a guy who came around here a couple of days ago. Always with the Vandina. - Where is Vandina? - Today you have to rehearse the new program. And what do I care? I've already told you that I don't know who it is. - You only know his name is Joe? - Yes. - And you've known him for a week. - Yes. Stop telling stories! It will be better for you. Better, why? Look, Commissioner, I'm not afraid of that. I am an honest woman and I have never had a problem with the police. I'm not going to start now. - Very well. - Very good, yes. If Joe has any outstanding bills with you, settle them with him. He said he was coming to pick me up after the show. Wait for it. Agree. And you will wait for him with us. - Why? - Because Joe is your friend. While we wait to meet him, we will question you. However you want. - When did you meet him? - A week ago, I already told you. �D�nde? - In a friend's house. - What is that friend's name? The poor thing is dead. Let's leave her alone. Look, we're going to do a trade. I will tell you the name of your friend and you tell me what you know. Okay? Her name was Magda Fiorelli and she has been assassinated. �No! And do you know who it was? Your Joe. Do you understand now what this is about? The morning ... Poor Magda! I will say everything I know. Fifteen days ago Magda told me she was in trouble because her husband no longer wanted to give her money. But, Joe made her keep blackmailing him. - Was Joe Magda's friend? - Yes. - And now it's yours. - No! Mine no. After Magda died, Joe came to see me. He wanted me to give him back a bracelet that Magda had sold me when I needed money. - The bracelet your husband gave you? - Yes. - And when did you give it to Joe? - The day before yesterday. You are a good girl. Now, pay attention ... You're going to do the following ... And now, gentlemen, the famous fantasists, the trapeze comedians ... Ahead. - Hello. - Ah, have you come? Yes, aren't you happy? Good evening, Mr. Pietrangeli. - How? Do you know him? - Is he Joe? S�. Shall. �Sal! Si�ntate. Giorgio, I have to talk to you. If he's come to tell you where Silvia is, I don't know anything. - Are you sure? - I don't know anything, I assure you. �Habla, imb�cil! No! I do not speak! I have nothing to say. - You know this, huh? - I? I have never seen it. You left it at Manni's! You're kidding me, Mr. Pietrangeli. And since it didn't work out for you because Manni had an alibi, you hid it in Silvia's room. You were Fiorelli's lover and you instigated her to blackmail Aldo and Silvia! How interesting ... You have a lot of fantasy. Oh yeah? Then I'll tell you something else. They've seen you and heard you call the police. The Fiorelli had decided to leave Aldo and Silvia alone against your will! And that day he went to tell her! But you, to prevent Magda from talking to Silvia ... You killed her! Vale... Yes, I killed her. I didn't want to go back ... So he pushed her against the railing and she fell. But there is nothing he can do. You have no evidence against me. I have your confession. Sorry... You are no longer a police officer and you also have no witnesses. Is not true. It is not true! Leave me! Help me, Commissioner! Mr. Pietrangeli, please help me! It was a disgrace! I swear! Help me, Mr. Pietrangeli! Please! Leave me! �D�jenme! �D�jenme! Commissar... What time will we meet tomorrow at the office? To the usual? Yes, the same as always. Thanks, Palermo. F I N
