This must be one of the most awkward poses you ever dreamed up, Tim Forrester. It's what the client wants. Just what am I supposed to be holding in my hand, a flaming torch? A bottle of beer. Berring's bottled beer, the cheerful glassful. What's this costume to do with beer? Men drink beer, men like pin-ups. Ipso facto, pin-ups sell beer! Men... Beasts! Alright. - Finished? - For today. I'm surprised I've still got the use of my arms. You oughtn't be wasting your time doing this sort of stuff, Tim. At 50 pounds a throw, I'd hardly call it 'wasting my time.' I'd hardly call it 'earning a living' either! Am I complaining? I still think you could do better. I've seen a lot of artists at work in the last few years, if my judgment is anything to go by-- Which it isn't! I still think you're wasting your time. Would I be wasting my time if I asked you to have dinner? Which means I do the cooking! Okay, so we'll go out some place. Either way, I can't. I have a date tonight. Oh... Alright. Why didn't you ask me yesterday? I wasn't hungry yesterday. You're always too late, aren't you, Tim? You've missed out on me all the way down the line. What do you mean by that? Nothing... - Who's your date? - Henry Carmichael. Oh... - I wonder what he does for a living. - All I know is he's rolling in money. As far as I'm concerned, that makes him the most eligible man of the year. - Has he proposed yet? - Not yet. But he will, huh? Oh, my technique is very rusty. Your weapons may be very old, honey, but your technique rusty? Never in a million years! Ah, talk of the devil! - Impatient, isn't he? - Oh, he hates to be kept waiting. Same time tomorrow? Yes, I suppose so... Look, Tim, you can't have it both ways! - Don't you think at my age-- - At 24? At 24, a girl starts worrying about the future. Do you think I want to spend more years collecting goose pimples in deep-freeze studios? We've had a lot of fun, Tim, but... Seems you're not the marrying kind! I must be crazy. You'd better go. - Tomorrow at ten. - Right. Bye! Henry, you've brought another car! You mad, impulsive creature! - What took you so long? - I had to change. You should have seen the ridiculous costume I was wearing-- The sooner you give up all this nonsense, the better! Darling, a girl's got to earn her living. Yes, well... That may not go on much longer. Henry! That was a proposal! Oh, darling! Well, now... Where would you like to eat? Why don't we just go round to your place and have a nice, quiet snack? Alright! Hi, Dave! What's new? Tim, I've got bad news. Don't tell me! You've had another letter from your bank manager. - How much is it this time? - Listen, it's about Lewis. His car crashed in Italy. You know, I've got two of the screwiest brothers in the whole world! What with you flying all over Europe, and Lewis and his fast cars! It's the third time he's hit something this year! Tim... Lewis is dead. What? He skidded over a cliff, his car caught fire. Lewis... dead? Oh, I don't believe it, Dave! Where d'you get this from? I've just come from this paper. They called the police in Milan. "Our correspondent Lewis Forrester was killed yesterday when his car crashed at Pereta, on the road to Milan." "Forrester was in his early thirties." It must have happened quickly, Tim. Stupid crazy idiot! - I'm flying out there tonight. - I'm going with you. There's no point in you going, Tim. Besides, I said I'd take a guy called Fenby from The Gazette. They're being swell about the whole thing, the paper's paying the funeral expenses. - Hello? - Is that Mr. Forrester? Yeah, speaking. - This is Fenby of The Gazette. -Oh, hello, Fenby. I just wanted to check what time you're taking off for Milan. In a couple of hours. I'll pick you up at seven. Oh, thanks. We've had another report from Milan. It seems there was someone else in the car with your brother. Oh? Who? -Ever heard of Alison Ford? - No, I've never heard of her. I just thought you might have. Well, what about this girl? She also died in the crash with your brother. Oh... Okay, then. Seven. Goodbye. - A girl? - In the car, with Lewis. Who was it? An actress called Alison Ford. Do you know her? Alison Ford? No... Also killed? POLICE CAPTAIN P. BRUNETTI I'm sorry, Signor Forrester, there is nothing more I can tell you. We received a body so horribly burnt that... There was an accident, your brother was killed, investigations continue. Thanks. I won't delay your work, you've been very kind. - You're welcome. - Thank you. We better be getting along. Goodbye. So, one more time. That was it. - That's all? - Yes, captain. - And it was sent to London? - Yes, captain. Hello? London's police station, please. Yes. That came in from the Amsterdam Police this morning. DeGroot arrived there by plane yesterday. The day before that, he was in Milan. We know that he contacted a killer in Milan. - Arturo was a member of the Ring? - That's right. - Why haven't Italian Police picked him up? - They did, this morning. Lying in the gutter with his throat cut. Italian Police think he was killed because he sold information to Lewis Forrester. - And now, he's dead! - Yes. Yes? Milan Police calling Inspector Colby. I'll take it in my office. - Give it through to Colby's office. - Right, Sir. - Milan Police. - I know. Inspector Colby speaking. Who? Ah! Hello! I've spoken to the concierge at the hotel where he stay. It seems Signor Forrester post a card to London the same day he die. - Who to in London? - This we do not know. - Do you know what was on the card? - Sorry? What was on the card? Oh! There was nothing on the card. Only a, uh... How you say? Um... Ah! A sketch, a drawing. A drawing? - What of? -A bottle. A bottle? Yes, a bottle of Chianti and a woman's hand. Can you describe it? - Was the bottle in her hand? - Yes, that's it. The, uh... the bottle, she was held in this woman's hand. - And that's all? - Yes. Ah... Alright, thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. What about Forrester's car? Find anything? Someone had sawn into the track rod. Aha... Alright, thank you. Goodbye. If Lewis Forrester were to send a card to someone in London, who d'you think he'd send it to? Doesn't that depend on the card, Sir? There are some postcards you just can't send to some people! - He might have sent it to his newspaper. - Check on that. - One of his brothers? - Isn't one of them an artist? Yes, Sir, we've got his address. Call my car. B6 transport. What did Italian Police say about his car? The track rod had been almost sawn in half. Inspector Colby's car, please. Right away. Then, it wasn't an accident! Did you think it was, Sergeant? Well, this seems to be the end of my career as a famous model. How d'you get on last night? Did you get a proposal or just a proposition? I'll have you know you're talking to the future Mrs. Carmichael. Good for you! Yes, I suppose it is. - Don't tell me you're changing your mind! - No, just my way of life. No more parties, no more fun... No more... anything! Nothing but eternal boredom with all that filthy money. Are you pleased with it? Not really. I don't know how you can concentrate at all after what's happened. Somebody's gotta pay the rent. Perhaps you'd feel better if you went to live with Dave. Maybe... Goodbye, Tim. Good luck, Jill. Just a little something to remember me by. Oh, here! I nearly forgot! Your wages. A five-pound note! I'll have it framed! Fancy you forgetting that! I owe you 16 shillings. I'll lie awake at night, worrying about it. Mr. Forrester? - Yes? - I'm Inspector Colby. Scotland Yard. Oh... Well, I-- I'll be running along. Goodbye! Attractive girl. - Yes. - Your fiancé? - She works for me. - Nice work! Um... what can I do for you, Inspector? I'm sorry to start nosing around so soon. I know how you must feel about your brother. Well, I... don't quite see really how I can help you much... You probably know as much about it as I do. There was an accident, he was killed. - Cigarette? - No, thank you. Every accident has to be investigated, Mr. Forrester. - There may be insurance claims, you see? - Oh, yes, of course. When did you last hear from your brother? About a week ago, he, uh... sent me a card from Rome. Could I see it? Sure... if I can find it. Thank you. Hmm! What about your other brother, the pilot? - When do you expect him back from Italy? - In a day or so, I should think. Does he live here with you? I hope not. He's away most of the time, has his own charter air service, running flowers in from France, that sort of thing. Here it is. "The weather's great, the wine's cheap and the women, sensational. Regards, Lewis." Short, but to the point. What's that supposed to be? What's it look like to you, Mr. Forrester? Like a bad sketch of a hand holding a bottle. I'm a policeman, not an artist. - You can say that again! - It's a Chianti bottle. - So? - Mean anything to you? Should it? Ever receive a card like that from your brother? - No. Why? - I see... If you'll excuse me. Sorry to have taken up your time. Aren't we being a bit mysterious? What's all this about? We know that your brother posted a card with a sketch like that to someone in London. I just thought it might have been you. What's a postcard got to do with Lewis' death? I'll tell you that when we've found it, Mr. Forrester. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. My name is Forrester, I have an appointment with Mr. John Smith. Oh, yes, he is expecting you. Oh, Joe! A Mr. Forrester, Sir. Come in! - Thank you. - Thank you. Sit down, Mr. Forrester. Help yourself to a drink. Uh, thank you. Not just now. Music interest you, Mr. Forrester? Some music. "The Voice of the Nightingale." Do you know it? No, I'm afraid I don't. You see, I don't get much time for music. I see... You said something on the phone about a portrait, Mr. Smith. Huh? Oh, yes, yes, I did. Have you ever painted from a photograph, Mr. Forrester? Yes, uh... It's not very creative, but it can be done. I want you to paint a picture of my daughter from a photograph. Would it not be possible for her to sit for me? Just a couple of times. No, Mr. Forrester, it won't be possible. - Oh... - I'll get the photographs. Here they are. - She's very beautiful. - Yes, she was. She was killed two days ago in a car crash in Italy. - You don't mean-- - Yes! She was in that car with your brother. I thought that girl's name was Alison Ford! She called herself 'Ford' when she decided to take up acting. 'Smith' is a very ordinary name, isn't it? How did you get in touch with me? Through your brother Lewis. The three of us dined in Rome a week ago. That was the last time I saw him. He told me you were a very good painter. Lewis? He wouldn't know the difference between Rembrandt and a house painting. - He was a fine boy. - Yes. - That's the one I'd like to work from. - The pink dress. She was very fond of it. - You couldn't get a hold of it, I suppose? - Yes, I think so. Alright, Mr. Smith. If you get me the dress, I'll do the portrait. Good! - Would you wait a minute, please? - Alright. - Thank you very much! - You're welcome. Good morning! Good morning. Keep your covetous hands off that dress, young lady. Darling, it's sensational! I'd slay them in that dummy! I'll slay you if you knock that dummy over. - You want some coffee? - Oh, no, thank you. You're looking pretty sharp yourself! New dress? - And a new hat! D'you like it? - It's ridiculous! It cost 15 guineas. Hats don't grow on trees, you know? That one looks as if it did! Old Moneybags Henry is paying off already, huh? What's this? More loot? No, that's something of Henry's. A man brought it round to my flat this morning. That's a funny thing to do. Henry lives in East Ham, as I'm having lunch with him, I suppose he thought it was the easiest way of getting it. What are you doing here? I thought we'd already bid a fond farewell. I came to fetch my dressing gown. And my make-up box! And my umbrella! Hmm! How's that? A new model? Just a girl I'm painting. Hmm, she's not bad... Well, I mustn't waste the entire morning! If you should find any more of my stuff, you-- - I forgot! I owe you 16 shillings! - Forget it. When's Dave coming back? Tonight, I'm meeting him at the airport at nine. Give him my love, will you? - Bye! - Bye. See you in the gossip columns! Jill! Jill! Hey, Jill! Jill! What happened to Fenby? He had a deadline or something. Didn't want to wait. - I was on time, wasn't I? - Sure, sure. It's been a couple of the grimmest days I've ever had in my life. You know, identifying the body was the worst part. Tim, I hardly recognized him. Were you able to find out exactly what happened? You can't find out a thing from those Italian cops. All they do is talk and talk, and they don't say nothin'! I guess it was just one of those things: sharp bend, fast car, couple of drinks... - Lewis drunk? You must be nuts. - That's what I told 'em-- He hardly touched the stuff, you know that, Dave. Sure, I know it, but... Well, it's not impossible. Dave, was Lewis mixed up in anything? - What do you mean, "mixed up?" - Well, the police have been to see me. Oh? About what? Something about a card that he's supposed to have sent to someone in London. - A card? - Yeah... Evidently, it had a drawing on it of a Chianti bottle and a woman's hand. - That sounds crazy! - I don't get it either. You left the door open again. The way you trust everybody... Wow, am I gonna hit that hay fast! I've been in the air seven hours. - We were gonna stop in Paris-- - Hey! - What's the matter? - It... it's gone! - Gone? What's gone? - Well, the dress! And the photo! What dress? And look at this! Someone's painted the face out! Oh, is that what it is? I thought it was an example of modern art. Who is that, anyhow? That screwball model you've always got hanging around here? Alison Ford. - Alison Ford! - Her father asked me to paint it. - I was... nearly finished, too. - How could you? She... I had a photo of her. She was very beautiful. Not when I saw her, stretched out on a slab in Milan! Who the heck would want to do a thing like that? Alison Ford's ghost? Maybe she just didn't like your style! Well, what do you know about that! I left my pyjamas back in Milan. Got a pair you could lend me? Sure... You know, I must have left pyjamas in all the principal cities of Europe. I guess me and Mr. Freud just don't like pyjamas! Dave! Dave, come here! What is it? It's Jill. She's wearing the dress. - What's the score? - Manual strangulation. - When? - About two hours ago. Eight o'clock. - Any more of the body? - No, you can cover the room. - Will you take care of this or shall I? - We'll do it. Sergeant! You'll have my report in the morning. Good night. - Good night. - Yes, Sir? - Throw her into the van, will you? - Yes, Sir! Some smudges here, Sir. Could have been made by somebody wearing gloves. - Check the body while we still have it. - Yes, Sir. Alright, let's see how far we've got. Girl's name was Jill Stewart, she modeled for you. You last saw her this afternoon... What time was it again? - Just before lunch. - Ah, yes. You left here around five to buy some paints. - Is that right? - Yes. You didn't come back, you went to the airport to meet your brother. You got there at nine, came back here, and found her dead. Correct? - Right. - That seems pretty straightforward. Does it? Apart from a few details we need to check. What about the dress? How come she's wearing Miss Ford's dress? How come you have Miss Ford's dress, Mr. Forrester? - But I told you! - Oh, yes, the portrait... Pretty difficult to do a portrait of someone you've never seen. - I had a photograph. - Where is it? - I don't know. It was here when I left. - Did anyone else see it? - Yes. - Who? Jill Stewart. Anyway, it was here when you left but had gone when you came back. In fact, a lot of things happened between the time you left and came back again. - What was Alison Ford's father's name? - Smith. John Smith. John Smith? Hmm... He's staying at the Mayflower Hotel, you can phone him. We will, Mr. Forrester. We will. I've covered everything, Sir. - Good night. - Good night, Sir. I may seem a bit dense, but about this dress... - It was on that dummy when you left? - Yes. When you came back, it was on the dead woman? Yes! Presumably, she came in while you were out and changed into it. - Obviously! - Why should she? I don't know! If she changed here, where's the dress she was wearing when she came in? Her own dress, in fact. What does it matter what she wearing? She's dead, someone killed her! - What's so important about a dress? - I don't know. But your brother seems to think it's important. - Does this belong to you? - No. What is it? - A bird in a cage. - It's part of a charm bracelet. Hmm... Did Jill Stewart have one of those things? - I've never seen her wearing one. - How long have you know her? About six months. I suppose you saw a good deal of her. Naturally! I was painting her. I don't paint with my eyes shut! Look, isn't this all very simple? If you think Tim had something to do with this, then just check up on where he was this afternoon. - That shouldn't be difficult. - That wouldn't do any good. I was all over the place: buying oils at Reeson's, canvasses in Chelsea... Around seven, where were you? Seven? I don't know... - Driving around, I guess. - Mhm... Alright, so it's not much of an alibi, but do I need one? Are you really suggesting I killed that girl? I haven't suggested anything, Mr. Forrester. But let's face it: she was found on your bed, in your flat! In there. Is this your parcel? No, uh... Jill left it behind this morning. She was taking it to her fiancé, Carmichael. Oh? How long had she been engaged to this man? - Two or three days. - Uh-huh... - Do you mind if I open this? - Would it make any difference if I did? A great deal, I'd have to apply for a search warrant. That takes time. Then, save time, by all means! Thank you. Alright, Joe. Let's see the label. - What do you think, Joe? - Printed in England. The space at the top is for the wine merchant to print his name. Perfectly ordinary label. Except there isn't a wine merchant named Nightingale in the country. - Infrared test. - I'll show you. - A standard watermark. - Hm... - Any prints on the bottle, John? - Yes, Sir. Sergeant Haynes'. Jack, I want blow-ups of this label distributed through Interpol to every police force in Europe. - Right, Sir. - Inspector, Mr. Forrester's here. Right... Keep all this stuff, Joe. You never know. Next time, keep your paws off the exhibits. Sorry, Sir! - Morning, Mr. Forrester. - Hello. Sit down. Thank you. Canteen, please. - Would you like some tea? - No, thanks. Colby here. It's five past eleven. Right. Try and get it here before it goes cold, will you? Thank you. What was it you wanted to see me about? You sent for me! Oh, yes, yes! Did anyone show you the statement you made last night? Yes. - Anything you want to alter? - No. - Anything you'd like to add? - No. You don't want to amend your story about this man 'Smith?' - No! Why should I? - No reason at all. They do say the taller the story, the more likely it is to be true. Just the same, doesn't it strike you a little... 'coincidental', shall we say? That this woman, Alison Ford, was killed along with your brother. That two days later, her father... Mr. Smith... asked you to paint her portrait? Gives you a photograph, which has now mysteriously vanished, and a dress belonging to his daughter which turns up on the body of a woman found dead in your studio! I don't suppose it's occurred to you to check with Smith. I'm anxious to. Your Mr. Smith left his hotel yesterday afternoon. Thank you. I don't relish the idea of tracking down a man by the name of Smith. Would you, Mr. Forrester? Dishwater! But hot. You sure you won't have some? Look, you think I killed Jill Stewart, don't you? Alright, just tell me one thing: why? Why should I want to kill her? Suppose you tell me! I remember now! I didn't like the way she made coffee, so I bumped her off! It's funny you should say that, there was a case that came up in 1935-- Look, let's quit horsing around, will you? If you want to judge me, go ahead! From where I'm standing, you haven't got evidence to pin a parking offense on me! Mhm... About this parcel, the bottle of Chianti. You said Miss Stewart took it to your flat for you to give to Carmichael? I didn't! I said she brought the parcel because she was lunching with Carmichael and she just forgot it, that's all. Why ask me? Ask Carmichael! At last, some service around here! - Sit down, Mr. Carmichael. - Thank you. I'm sorry to subject you to questioning. Please! Anything I can do to help find out who killed my-- What can I tell you? A parcel was delivered in Miss Stewart's flat the morning she was killed. Do you know about it? No. - She was to have lunch with you? - That's right. Our information is that she was to take this parcel to you to avoid delay in the post. Extremely odd... I don't understand. What was in the parcel? I was hoping you'd be able to tell me. How can I? I never received it. You a wine drinker? No. Curious... The parcel contained a bottle of Chianti. - It was addressed to me? - It wasn't addressed to anybody-- Are you questioning me or is Mr. Forrester? Do you wish to say any more, Mr. Carmichael? No... You don't seem too sure. I'd rather say no more. You've no time for guess-work. I have time for anything you say. You knew Miss Stewart better than anybody. Did I? I have no illusions about myself, Inspector. Perhaps I'd have been a dullish husband for Jill. But I'd have done my best to make her happy. I have no illusions about Jill either. She moved in bohemian circles. She was a sweet, generous girl. Many men must have... admired her. Wanted her. It's possible that one wanted her sufficiently to kill her, when she broke it off with him after her engagement to me. It's not difficult to imagine the scene! No, not difficult at all! Why not fill in the last detail: me! Anything more I can tell you, Inspector? No, thank you. Interesting theory. How does it strike you, Mr. Forrester? - Oh, anything's possible! - Right. Want to amend your statement? - No! I've told you the truth! - Alright. Simple enough. Have a nice lunch. No, Madam. Mr. Smith left no forwarding address. He's used this hotel for years. Surely you must have some idea of where he might go. I'm afraid not, Madam. Please, think! I can't tell you how important he is! I'm afraid I can't assist you, Madam. Even if I did know, I'm sure you appreciate that I couldn't give such information to a complete stranger. Darling, I'm not a stranger to Mr. Smith, I'm-- Yes, Madam? Nothing... You're right... you can't help. Thank you. That was a good meal, Dave. No wonder you always use this place. Mind if I push off? I'm a bit late. - I've got to pick up a load of asparagus. - Oh, sure. Take care of yourself on that freighter of yours. I always do! - Telephone, Mr. Forrester. - Thank you. - Yes? - Uh, Mr. Forrester? - Yes, but-- -My name's Dorking. Do you know Fulham Road, Mr. Forrester? - Huh? -Well, my place is just off Fulham Road. Saxon Street, Reg Dorking, Secondhand Cars. Look, you've got the wrong number. I've a car that may interest you, Mr. Forrester. A Mercedes Special. - What's that? -Second-hand, of course. -But in excellent condition, considering-- - Considering what? When I got it, it was a complete wreck. Went over a cliff in Italy a few days ago, absolute write-off! But you should see-- Look, give me that again, I didn't-- I'm not gonna repeat myself! Are you interested or aren't you? Make up your mind! - What d'you say your name was? - Reg Dorking. You've got the address: Saxon Street, off of Fulham Road. Bye for now! Reg Dorking? - Yeah. - My name's Forrester. What's all this about my brother's car? Your brother's car? Yeah, the Mercedes that crashed in Italy. How d'you come to get hold of it? I've got news for you, Mr. Forrester. I haven't had a Mercedes in this showroom for... oh, two years now. No market for 'em in my end of the trade. Why did you mention it, then? Would you have come here if I hadn't, Mr. Forrester? Cigar? No, thanks. Alright, let's have it. What do you want? It's more a question of what you want, Mr. Forrester. Oh, ghastly horrible things, cigars! But they give a man a certain style, don't you think? Where were we? Hm, yeah! I have a friend who's got something he says you'll pay 1,500 pounds for. Your friend must be nuts! That's what I told him, but he assures me he isn't. Who is this friend of yours? He's an old school chum, we were expelled together. What is it I want that's worth 1,500 pounds? It's a postcard, Mr. Forrester. A card with a little drawing on it: a bottle of Chianti and a girl's hand. I shouldn't have thought it was worth 15 shillings, let alone 1,500 pounds! Let's have a look at it. Ah! Now, that! I must admit you have me, Mr. Forrester. I don't happen to have it here at the moment. But then, I don't suppose you happen to have 1,500 pounds! - When will you have the card? - When will you have the money? - It might take some time. - With your connections? I shouldn't have thought so. Anyway, I'm afraid time is the one thing my friend can't afford. Tomorrow night? Alright. Get it here around ten. Oh, and Mr. Forrester? No funny business. I wasn't born yesterday, you know? Hello? This is Dorking. The bird has just departed. Or should I say, the nightingale has just flown. Tip-top condition, brand-new tires, well, almost brand new. Absolute snip, old boy! Absolute snip! - How many miles? - Fifteen thousand. On a 1935 car? Ah, he's a very economical owner, the chap who had this. Used to walk whenever he could. - Telephone engineer, Sir? - Yeah, about time, too! Ruddy thing's been driving me mad, can't get through at all! Bad for business, you know? Very bad! - Where is it, Sir? - Through there, help yourself. Paint work's badly scratched. What do you expect for 300, gold leaf? Is that you, Ted? Bill here. This is that special job on Fulham 8000. - You go ahead, I'll check at this end. - Okay. Alright, 250. I don't know what I'm saying, but 250. Hmm, 250... That is a little more in the neighborhood of what I had in mind. You must live in a pretty crumby neighborhood. Pity about that crack on the windshield, though. Engineer. Bill again. Try it now. Right. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, all good children go to heaven! - Hear that? -Clear as a bell. Right! Okay, I'll get the book. Hello. What's wrong with your phone? Been trying to get you all morning. I'm afraid I can't do anything about it, I'll have to check at the junction. Alright, but get it going soon. It's costing me money! We'll do our best, Sir. See? -Gazette? - Yes? - May I speak with My. Fenby, please? -Hold on. Mr. Fenby? Sorry, he's out of town on a story. Can't say when he'll be back. You can leave him a message. Hello? Hello? Come in! - Oh, hello! - Hello, Fenby. Sorry to arrive unheralded, I've been out all day on a story. - That's alright. What can I do for you? - Is Dave around? - No, he's in Paris. - Lucky chap! Yeah. Can I help? Uh, no, I... don't think so. If it makes you feel any better, I'd like to say how bad we all feel at the office about your brother. He was a good scout, Lewis. Everybody liked him. Evidently, somebody didn't! What d'you mean? I don't believe Lewis was drunk when he was killed. I don't believe his death was an accident either. Dear chap, you're letting your imagination run away with you! Am I? Did he ever send you a postcard? - Who? Lewis? - Yeah. Yes, dozens! Did he ever send you one with a Chianti bottle sketched on it? Well, he was always sending strange cards to people. I don't recall anything like that. Why? Is it important? It's worth 1,500 pounds. I guess that makes it important. I don't think I quite understand. You don't understand? I better be getting along. - Tell Dave to give me a ring. - Okay. He certainly gets around, that brother of yours! He made Milan to London in four hours the other day. Lunch in Italy, tea in London! Amazing! I thought you didn't get back til nine. No, I was back in the office at six. Well, be seeing you. Yeah... - Yes? -Colby here. We'll be round at your place in ten minutes. - I'll be ready. -Good. - Looks genuine enough. - Well, it isn't. And they've been counted, so don't get sticky fingers! - Driver, pull up at the next corner. - Yes, Sir. I know a bit about Dorking. He's not as stupid as he looks, so watch your step. Try and find out who his friend is. Right. Righto, Sergeant. Go ahead. C4 to M2MP, come in, please. Over. M2MP, hello, C4. Already here. Over. Alright, you can feed the GPO line in through this channel now. Over. - Hello. - Come in. It's pretty cold tonight. Like a drink? Scotch or gin? Neither. Well now, where were we? Did you get the card? The card... yes, of course. Um... I must confess, I ran into a few snags, old boy. What d'you mean? Oh, of course, I did my best. Who wouldn't fall over backwards for 1,500 pounds? But my best, it seems, just wasn't good enough. - You mean, you haven't got the card? - No, I'm afraid I haven't. Mind you, I've nosed around. I've got a lot of contacts. But I just couldn't get a lead. Even if you'd offered me 15,000 I don't think I could have tried any harder. Look here, Dorking, what is this? You contacted me! You told me you had the card, it was you who wanted 1,500 pounds for it! What a gross distortion of the true situation, if I may say so. The whole deal smelled a bit dodgy to me from the beginning. What, I ask myself, could be on a card that's worth 1,500 pounds? And you know what? I just didn't know how to answer myself. Look... Here's the money, all 1,500 of it. Now, what about it? My goodness! All that money! You want to be careful, Mr. Forrester. It's not safe to be walking around with a load like that. You never know who you may run into! Tell, you little twisted-- D'you mind? I had this suit pressed this morning. I haven't heard so many tall stories since I stopped reading Hans Andersen! People changing their clothes for no reason, photographs disappearing, paintings being rubbed out, a mysterious Mr. Smith... who commissions you to do a portrait then vanishes into thin air! It's too much, Mr. Forrester! Maybe for you, Inspector, but it happens to be true! Does it? Do you recognize this dress? - The one Jill was wearing. - The one you say you got from Smith. The one I got from Smith! This dress was bought by Miss Stewart from a shop in South Audley Street! But that's impossible! The shop identified the dress and recognized a photograph of Miss Stewart, there's no doubt about it. Look, Inspector, I don't know what the answer is. Now, you listen to me. My advice to you is to get a good lawyer, you're gonna need one! Good night. And Mr. Forrester? If you happen to meet Abraham Lincoln on the way home, keep it to yourself, will you? - Thank you. - Thanks, Miss. You're Tim Forrester? Yes... yes, I am. - And you're... - Alison Ford. - May I please come in? - Sure... - Are you alright? - Yes, I'm... Here, sit down. Thanks. - What you need is a drink. - No, no! I'm alright. This'll make you feel better. Thanks. Maybe you'd better finish it, you don't look so hot yourself. Does that surprise you? I'm looking at a ghost! You're dead! I mean, you're supposed to be dead. Maybe it'd be better if I were. Now, what kind of talk is that? The kind that comes when you're alone, confused... real confused... Forgive me, I didn't mean to sound so sorry for myself. But so much has happened, everything's so mixed up. Sure. Sure, I understand. So, we sort it out. We start at the beginning and sort it out. Just relax until I get Inspector Colby over here. The police? Sure! Why not? You can't! Not the police! I want you to help me. I've tried on my own and failed. There's no one else I can turn to. Please, not the police! - What have you got against the police? - Nothing. - What have they got against you, then? - Nothing! Why are you afraid? Why are you here? Don't call them, please. I'll explain. Okay... Have it your way. Thanks. I was on a holiday in Italy with my father. We met Lewis. We got on fine. Lewis invited me to drive to Milan with him. My father said I wasn't to go. I got angry with him, ordering me around, so I went anyway. Lewis told me he was digging up facts for a big story exposing a group of diamond smugglers. They call themselves the Arlington Ring. He said... my father was one of them. I told him he was crazy! Covering that story, I said, "You see smugglers everywhere!" He insisted, I wouldn't believe it! Well, we had this terrible row. I saw red, made him stop the car, and got out. It saved my life for sure. The car crashed and... Who was the other girl? A hitchhiker, I guess... Burned so badly, they thought she was me. Nobody miss her? There's a lot of people alone in this world, nobody misses them. Go on. I thumbed a ride into Milan and heard about the crash. I phoned my father's hotel to put his mind at ease. He'd left for England as soon as news of the crash got to him. Don't you see? Immediately, I thought... my father knew that car was gonna crash. The gang had fixed to kill Lewis. That's why he didn't want me on that trip! Oh, I... I'd slap myself down, it... couldn't be! It just couldn't be that my father was a crook! He just didn't want me to traipse all over Europe with a man I'd only known a few days! That's reasonable, isn't it? Reasonable enough, except you can't find him to ask him straight out. There are millions of reasons he's left London without a forwarding address. Name one. He thinks I'm dead. So, he wants to go away and not be bothered by anybody! Yeah, see... He could have left Italy for the same reason. That's what I thought! So, I came back here to find him. I can't! I can't, anywhere! You don't want to go to the police, in case... He's my father. I've got to give him a chance. And when I find him... I hope he socks me for even thinking he could be a crook. You know something? You've been alone too long and you need a meal. - Tim, there's something more I must-- - Later! Food first. You need looking after, young lady. Were you in love with him? I wouldn't say I was in love with Lewis, but... I was very fond of him. As for marrying him... If he ever thought about it, I doubt he'd have found time to ask me. Listen, about your father... You never suspected anything until Italy... and Lewis? This was the first time I'd seen him in years. My folks divorced when I was kid. I went to America with my mother. She died about a month ago. He invited me over to stay a while. I know nobody else over here. You know me now, don't you? Wine list, Sir? Thank you. - You'd like some wine, wouldn't you? - I'd love some Chianti. Chianti? - A bottle of Chianti, Sir? - Yes, thank you. Why did you choose Chianti? I like it! With Lewis, we always drank it. In a cafe, one day, just before he was killed... he made a drawing of me pouring a bottle, well of my hand, anyway. - Was this drawing on a postcard? - Yes! How'd you know? Do you know who he sent it to? The same man he sent lots of cards to, the man of The Gazette. Fenby? Yes, that's it. Is it important? Yes, it is! Will you excuse me? I have an important phone call to make. This is Tim Forrester speaking. May I speak to Inspector Colby, please? Just a moment, Sir. No reply, Sir. Shall I connect you with CID duty room? No, thanks. Ask Inspector Colby to ring me first thing in the morning. -Certainly, Sir. - Thank you. Sorry about that. Thank goodness I made up my mind to come and see you. This is the most relaxed I've been since the-- Look, just forget all about that for this evening. I can't forget about my father. How are we gonna find him? We can't do anything about it tonight, can we? Let's worry about it in the morning. Drink your wine. What are you looking at? Your bracelet. It's very attractive. Thank you. It's fun collecting things for it. But I lose them just as easily. Just the other day, I lost one in the middle of all my other troubles. Oh? What was it? A little trinket I found in Italy, a birdcage, complete with a little bird inside. Good night, Tim. I don't like the idea of you staying in a joint like this. I'll be alright. - Alison... - Hmm? Oh, nothing, no... I'll pick you up first thing in the morning. Alright. Good night, Tim, and thanks for everything. - Good night. - Good night. Alison! - Look, you can't stay on here. - Why not? We're up against dangerous people. One girl's been killed already. Anything may happen! It's just for a night. We'll find my father, I know we will. I can't allow you to stay on here. Come over to my place, you can have Dave's room. No, I can't. Go upstairs and get your things, you're checking out of here. There's no need, I'll be okay. This is Dave's room. Should be reasonably fit for human habitation. Well, come in! - Make yourself at home. - Thanks. Bathroom's up there, on the right. That's my room. I know. You know? Tim, you're gonna hate me. I should have told you before but... Should have told me what? You've got to realize before I tell you, I haven't been exactly myself these last few days. Sure. Tim... I've been here before. I came straight here when I first arrived in London. The door was open. Like it is now! You're not very good at shutting doors, you know! I came in looking for you to help me find my father. I saw the portrait and my photograph, I couldn't figure this... I started to look around and... Jill. I saw that girl and... Oh, please, try to understand, Tim! All I could think of was I mustn't be connected with this in any way. So, I tore off the dress from the wire stand, that one there, and tried to rub out the face from the portrait. Your... beautiful portrait. Oh, Tim, can you ever forgive me? You poor kid. What you've been through... Of course, I forgive you, easily. You, at least, have explained a couple of things for the first time since this whole business started. I don't hate you, not one little bit. Thanks. I see you repaired the damage. Yes, I tried. But I couldn't get the eyes right. Now, I can see what was missing from the photograph. Now, we've met... maybe you'll be able to complete it. Yeah, maybe. Look, Alison... you've got to be sensible about this. Whichever way it works out for your father, you have to go to the police. It's fair it's done on him, and not you in the long run. You're probably right but... Do something for me, Tim. Give me one more chance to contact him before you call them. I guess confessions are catching. I've got one for you: I've already asked Colby to come round first thing in the morning. It's the best way, believe me. I see... Good morning. Like some coffee? Hey, Caruso! It's your long-lost brother, back from gay Paris! Not so loud, will ya? Look what I got for ya! Very funny! Hey, Dave! - Hold it, will ya? - What's the idea? Tim, I've been up all night, I need a bath and change of clothes. Well, you-- you can't go in there. Use-- use my room. Ah! So, that's what all the singing's about! You old wolf, you! Tell me: blonde, brunette, redhead? - It's not like that at all-- - Sure, sure! I know, you're just talking about art! Okay, I'll use your room. Hello? Yes, speaking. Well, Mr. Forrester? I don't expect you to believe this, Inspector, but Alison Ford is here! She's alive and she's right here in my flat! How did she arrive? On a broomstick? What's more, she knows who the card was posted to! Santa Claus, no doubt. Why don't you come over and ask her yourself? Alright. Did I hear something about that card? - Yeah. - That's been bothering me for days. Why's everyone so interested in a postcard? Well, we'll soon know. - You know who's got it? - I do. Tell me, for Pete's sake! The suspense is killing me! Your pal, Fenby. No kidding! What's that make him, a villain or something? - Or something... - Well, what do you know? Goes to show you you can't trust no one these days! Hmm... Tim, you don't want me hanging around here. I-- I think I'll get myself a hotel room for the day. - There's no rush, Dave. - For l'amour, anything! Take it easy, kid! Take Mr. Smith's newspaper to him. Excuse me, is that for Mr. John Smith? - Yes, Miss. Room 14. - Thank you. Don't waste time! My brother told me you have the card! By now, the police probably know! I swear I haven't! You can search the place! - There's no time for games! Come on! - Please! Dave, if I still had it, I'd give it to you! - What do you mean, "if you still had it?" - I... I posted it! Don't lie to me or I'll brain you! It-- it's true, Dave! I swear it! I'm sick of the whole business! I've never tried anything like this before. I wish to heaven I'd never seen the card! Where is it? I sent it to your brother. It's his responsibility now, go and see him! You miserable little coward. You know all the names that were on that card, don't you, Fenby? Oh, my dear girl! Everyone said you were in the car with Lewis Forrester! How can you do this? Why didn't you let me know you were alright? - I begged you not to go with him! - Why? Did you know something was going to happen to that car? Please, Alison! Listen! Only to the truth. Are you in the Arlington Ring? What? What do you mean? Did you kill Lewis? What do you mean? What-- - Hello? - I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr. Smith. I know you especially asked for no calls to be put through but this gentleman insisted you'd speak to him. The name's Nightingale. Mr. Nightingale. Put him on, please. Better talk to her myself. Where is she? - I don't know. - What do you mean? She was here last night, honestly, Inspector! She stayed in Dave's room but must have left early this morning. I don't care what you say, I'm finished! I mean it! I mean it! It's my last word! Father, what is it? Who was it? Tell me! Alright. What did she say about this card? She said Lewis had sent it to Fenby. - Fenby of The Gazette? - Yes. If Alison Ford comes back, phone me at once. - Inspector. - Mr. Carmichael. What do you want? Good morning, Mr. Forrester. I was a bit rude last time we met. I'm afraid I behaved rather badly. I'd like to apologize. Apology accepted. - Is that all? - Well, no. Not exactly. - I wanted to ask you a favor. - A favor? You were painting a picture of Jill, weren't you? - So? - Could I buy it? It's not for sale, it belongs to a client. Advertising people. - Oh... - I'm sorry but I have to go out now. I'll see if I have any sketches that'll do. Perhaps you can ring me later. Thanks very much. Funny, I could have sworn he was in. He's dead, alright. Not long, either. Call the doctor and photographer, and a fingerprint man too. Use an outside phone. Know anything about this? Who? Me? He's got two bullets in him. Did you hear anything in the last half hour? Well, I did hear something. I thought it was the boiler! See anyone come up here? When I went to look at the boiler, I did see a man going out of the main entrance. What was he like? - I just saw a back view. - Well, describe that. Huh, could have been anyone! What was he wearing? I did notice one thing: when he went out, he took off his gloves. Struck me as odd... You'd expect him to be putting 'em on, wouldn't you? - What were they like? - Very light. Pig skin or chamois, or something like that. Anything else? No. Go to the police, tell them what you know. You don't know what you're saying! The Ring! They'd kill me, they'd kill me! I must go away. It'd be better if you never see me again! - Can I help you, Sir? - Yes-- No, it's alright. Thank you. - Alison! - Tim! I was gonna call you! You ran out on me. He's here, it's true! I can't get him to see-- - Maybe the police will succeed. - You can't! He's through with the Ring. - But are they through with him? - Please! You've got to give him a chance! Call an ambulance, quick! Someone's fallen from a window! Father! Right. Thank you, Sister. You call me if there's any change. Thanks again. What are you doing here at this hour? Waiting for your girlfriend to surface. I want the rest of my things. What, at 7:30 in the morning? Yeah... Tim, I'm leaving England. The charter business is not going too hot. I thought it was going great guns! Oh, airplanes, you know... Funny business, plenty of ups and downs. Hmm... You know best, Dave, but... This is... a bit sudden, isn't it? Well, there's a sudden offer from South America. Nice weather, good money, señoritas, too good to miss. Thought I'd give it a try. Where did you say you were going? I don't know exactly, somewhere in South America. It's sort of a roving commission, kind of uncertain-like. Dave, we've never interfered in each other's lives-- Yeah, so let's not start now, huh? Okay... If you want to get your things together, there's no one in that room now. I'll have that card, Tim. What? That card, I want it. What are you talking about? Are you gonna give it to me or do I have to take it? I'm giving this card to no one except the police! Tim, my name's on that card. - Huh? - I'm in the Ring. I don't believe it! For Pete's sake, alright, so I smuggled diamonds while I make a few pounds on the side! Two people have been murdered. One of them, your own brother! You think I had anything to do with that? That I was asked, "Is it okay if we bump off your brother?" All I do is fly stuff across the continent, I'm just a stooge, you gotta believe that, Tim! And Fenby... You knew Fenby had this card, Dave. I didn't do that, Tim. I shook him up a bit, but I didn't kill him. Now, hand it over. There's nothing on it except Fenby's address and the drawing. I mean it, Tim. Hand it over, or do I have to break you in two? Dave, this is crazy! Come on, get up! Now, get this straight! This card is the cause of two murders and a possible suicide. Three murders, if we count the unknown girl in Italy, heaven knows how many more besides! I don't know what you do with these things, but do it all! A dozen times over if necessary. X-ray it, atomize it, but I want the secrets of that card fast, understood? - Yes, Sir! - Right, get going. - We're grateful to you, Mr. Forrester. - Oh, thanks. I'm sorry your brother had to get mixed in this. Thank you. Look, what's on this card, anyway? Can't you make a reasonable guess, Mr. Forrester? Look... your brother Dave told you that his name was on it. He was in the smuggling racket. My guess is your brother Lewis wrote on that card in code or secret ink the complete list of the members of the Arlington Smuggling Ring. Why send it to Fenby? So it'd be in safe hands if anything happened to him. Well, something did happen to him. And Fenby's hands weren't any too safe! What a set-up for a blackmailer. Having the screws in a whole gang of diamond smugglers. - With Dorking as the front. - Of course! What I can't understand is why did Dorking contact me? He must have got you mixed up with your brother Dave! Hmm, then Fenby finds out... Finds out! Wow, I'm the one that told him! What a dope I turned out to be! No comment. Now, someone else finds out that Fenby has this card, so Fenby is disposed of. Yes, but by who, though? Who? Maybe we'll soon learn who Mr. Nightingale is. And that way, learn everything. Meanwhile, we can only wait and see! One thing I can't understand, Inspector, who could have killed poor little Jill Stewart, and why? Inspector Colby at once! Alright. Does that answer your question? It's fantastic! A lot of ordinary people would do strange things for money, Mr. Forrester. Quite a who's who of the underworld, they're all here. A few we've never heard of: Paletti, Grundas, DeGroot, Sahani, Smith, plus your old friend! Haynes! That's our man. Issue a general alarm, have him picked up. - Very good, Sir. - Colby! Oh? When? Alright, I'll leave it to you, then. Dead? They're taking his daughter back to your place. Yes, alright... Would you like me to come with you? No, thanks. I'll be alright. Tim? Is that you? Tim? Who are you? I'm a friend of Tim's. He said I could come over and borrow his camera. I don't seem able to find it, though. It doesn't matter, I'll call back. Excuse me. Haven't we met before? It was only for a moment, in Italy. My father introduced us. - Your father? - Yes, I'm sure. - Are you? - Absolutely! You... you know my father, John Smith. I'm Alison Ford, stage name. I remember telling you. At the time, we laughed about it. Do you remember... now... Mr... Nightingale! Miss Ford, of course! How ungallant of me to forget such a charming young lady. Forgive me! Charming... like another young lady I knew! She also knew too much about me, and was unfaithful, in addition. Two good reasons for her departure! In your case... one reason is enough! This is gonna sting. Hey! What are you trying to do, kill me? Gonna have to look after him, Miss Ford. He's had a rough time lately. Mostly at your hands, Inspector! I wouldn't mind having this in my office as a memento. Is it for sale? No, sir, it's not for sale! Now, I wonder why not. Alison... Do you think you can stay until I finish the portrait? How long will it take? Years. A lifetime, maybe. I think I can wait.
