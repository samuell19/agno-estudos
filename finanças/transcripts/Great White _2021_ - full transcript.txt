Wait. Don't. Hey, I told you to stop doing that. Yeah, 'cause I listen to you. What do you think of this place? -Yeah, I like this place. -Yeah? You reckon we could stay here? Maybe. Tide's on the move. We better head back. Good one for the blog. Oh, my God! There's something there! There was something right there! -Nothing there. -Something right there! I don't see anything. There's nothing there. -There was something right there! -Baby, there's nothing there. -I literally just saw something-- -Tracy! Trace! -Calm down, I believe you. Okay? -Okay. -I believe you. -Okay. -Let's get back. All right? -Okay. Nice and calm, okay? Come on. -Come on, baby. -Luke, hurry up. Oh, fuck. Luke? Luke? Luke! No, no, no! No! No! No! Fucking awesome. If you wanted a roller coaster, we could've gone to Dreamworld. Charlie. It's just a couple of turns. And a chandelle. Shit. You gotta be kidding me. Why? You know what, your mess you clean it. All right? Well, technically, it wasn't my mess. Hey, I thought you were the nurse. Triage nurse, Charlie, triage. Piss bottles and puke bags are not on my radar. He threw up on the microphone. Well, don't put it there. Bathroom. Come on. Gonna have to change the plugs soon, she's starting to run a bit rough on idle. Okay. And? I think that's enough work for today. There's a couple of beers in there with our names on them. You know I'm mad at you, right? Doesn't look like it. So, the bank called again today. I told them that you would call them back when you landed. Come on. So you want me to charm them into an extra few weeks' grace? Yeah, well, I would love that but we can't keep doing that forever. I can. We can't. If we do, they'll cut off our line of credit and then we can't run our business. You can be so damn practical sometimes. Fine, you win. I'll call them. Thank you. What? Nothing. Do you ever think maybe we should get married? Hold that thought. Pearl Air Charter Service. Yeah. Yeah, we do that. I'll just have to check my bookings, but when were you thinking? Okay, great. I can make that work. Have you been on the website? Great. Great. Okay. If you could just give me your email address… Yep. Perfect. Well, I'll flick you a note to confirm. And we'll see you tomorrow. -Tomorrow? -Yeah. Hell's Reef. Lunch on the reef, the whole enchilada. -Tomorrow? -Yeah, midday. Hey. It's okay. This is good. Hey. They're here. It's a nice car. Fancy. All right, let's go. Minase? I thought he was Italian. Hi there. Kaz Fellows. Welcome to the Pearl Coast, Mr. Minase. I'm Joji, but everyone calls me Jo. Thank you. My wife Michelle. -Hi. -Hi. This is Charlie. You two spoke on the phone yesterday. Yes, of course. Captain Charlie. CC, like the chips. -Yeah. -Nice to meet you. You too. -So, we ready? -We're all set. Ready when you are. -Very good. -Great. I told you we'd make it for the 12th. There's wonderful snorkeling out there if you're interested. I love it. Runs in the family. But we don't get to the water much. No. I'll just sit on the beach. If there's a cold beer in my hand I'll be happy. Now that I can guarantee. All right. Well, come on. I'll show you around. Thanks. Wonderful. We're just loading everything up. Watch your step. Thank you. You first. Here we go, eh? Yeah. How long? Ninety minutes cruising. Arrive in time for a late lunch. Excellent. I hope you're not expecting anything too rough? I'm not a great flyer. I make sure all my passengers have a good flight. Is he coming? Benny's our cook. As long as that's all he does. You guys good back there? Yes, we are. Keep your eyes open, you might see a whale. Or a shark. Shark? Great white. You don't wanna go swimming with one of them. Benny. Unlikely. It's the wrong time of the year. -You sure? -Oh, yeah, he's sure. Charlie here trained as a marine biologist. He was a good one. I thought so too, until a shark took a bite out of me. Here we go. Really? What happened? Darling, please. He may not wanna talk about it. Bring back bad memories. Nah, it's fine. Doesn't worry me. I was researching blacktip reef sharks and their pack hunting skills. They're damn good at it. One day, I was out on my own. First mistake. And one grabbed me from behind, spat me out. Never saw it coming. Second mistake, not paying attention. Luckily, it was more of a love bite than a real chomp. A love bite that put him in the hospital for two weeks. You'll love this, Joji. A few years back, a group of tourists went on one of them shark tours… When a three-meter shark, great white, jumped into the back of the boat… Scared the hell out of them. Benny. It's okay. Welcome to Hell's Reef. We made it. Officially, it's called Imperious Reef, but local divers renamed it after a pearl lugger was shipwrecked here on the reef out there during a storm. It's actually a crazy story. Eight crew members were stranded here for fifteen days with no food and no water. Only one of them survived-- An 18-year-old Japanese diver. Saeki Morita. Yeah. My grandfather. 12th of October, 1951. You know the story? Every pearler knows the story. Saeki's a bit of a legend around here. His dying wish was to be here with his shipmates. Shall we take a look around? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Go, go. Here. Thanks. Gonna tell them it's a national park, they shouldn't be doing that? No, I'm not. Just go help Benny, all right? Come on, big boy. Stunning. I love it out here. Me too. Hey, you know how we were… talking crazy yesterday about the idea of maybe getting married? I think you should make an honest man out of me. I don't know if that's possible, -but if you're being serious-- -Look! God, they're beautiful! Charlie? I'm pregnant. Yeah. Are you gonna say anything else? Are you… Are you okay? I'm fine. Is that it? So, what now? I think that we… finish this trip and then… get married, yeah? Are you sure? About being pregnant or getting married? No, about me being the father. You're such a jerk! I know this… wasn't planned at all. But are you okay? I am. I really am. It's a surprise, but an awesome one. I just don't really know what we're gonna do, you know? With the business and money and us and a baby. Hey, we'll be fine. More than fine. We'll crush it. Like we always do. Hey! -Charlie! -What's he carrying on about? Kaz! What's up, mate? You two need to come with me. Hey. Michelle? Are you okay? No, she's not fucking okay. What is it? There. Charlie? Fuck. Shit. We need to get them out of here. Shark attack? Yeah. -Should we tell someone? -I already did. The coast guard are gonna handle it. It's gotta be out there somewhere. What? Their boat. She could still be alive. And out there she won't last very long. "She"? How do you know there's anyone else? We should leave this to the authorities. You've got no idea where to look and the chance of finding anything is almost zero. Yeah, we have to try. I wanna get out of here. My charter, my call! It's not happening, mate. We've got 45 minutes' fuel reserve. We're gonna put our eyes on this place. We'll be at 1,000 feet. Anyone sees anything we'll check it out. Guessing all this shit went down yesterday, so with the tides and currents, the best we can do is cover the eastern side. There! Down there! Okay, we're going down. Gotta take a look. Yeah. No. You can't. If you get hurt down there, who flies this plane? Benny? Sure. If anything goes wrong, bang on the hull. Loud. Come on, Benny. Benny! You okay? Was she attacked? Shit. Come on, guys. Let's get out of here. You all right? What's next? Home. Come on, Benny, move it. Yeah. Sweet as. -What the hell was that? -Michelle! Michelle! Hey, hey, hey! Are you okay? No. -Get her out of here. -Come on. Benny. Where's Benny? -Benny! -I can't get if off. Benny, get the life raft. Move. We're done. This'll be on the bottom in a few minutes. -The seatbelt, get it. -I know, I can't… Are you okay? -Are you sure? -Now, Jo. Michelle, come on. I warned you. I told you. Get out! Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. Cessna 206 seaplane… We gotta get outta here. Just grab whatever you can. Lifejackets, flares, wetsuits, water. Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. Cessna 206 seaplane. 31417. 15 nautical miles north-east of Hell's Reef. Do you read me? Please respond. Charlie, we gotta get out now! Five POBs, starboard pontoon destroyed. We're sinking fast. If you read me, respond. Over. -Get in the raft, Jo. -I'm not getting in that. This plane's gonna be on the bottom in a minute. I'm not floating with that out there. Jo, please! Like I said, your choice. Put the life jacket on! Jo! Jo, come on! Hurry up! Jo! Come on, Jo! Quick! Come on! Quick. Grab him. Come on. You're gonna need a couple of stitches but it's actually not deep. Sorry. Thanks, Kaz. Did you get a mayday out? Maybe. I'm not sure. You're kidding me. He's not sure. That shit box have a safety beacon? It's gone with the plane. We've been attacked. We're floating around in this piece of plastic junk and you're not sure if anyone knows how fucked we are or even where we are? What about the rescue boat? It's on its way, isn't it? Shouldn't we wait for them? They know we're out here. We're in the current. By morning we'll be 75 Ks from here. That'll take them days to find us. And a search plane? It'll be dark soon. They won't send a plane until first light. We're way off course, and I figure 150 K from shore. A hundred and fifty kilometers? Our best chance is to use the current. It's running for us, if we paddle with it, we'll make land tomorrow afternoon. If we're not picked up before then. Could we go back? To the Reef? Not an option. Says you. Yeah. And what do you got to say, mate? Because all I've seen so far is a bunch of pissing and moaning. What, you got a better idea? The current is running at five knots, running east towards the coast. Hell's Reef is over there, to the southwest. We can't paddle against it, we won't get anywhere. So we use it to get to the coast. They're the facts, you're the analyst. You fucking figure it out. What about… it? Maybe it'll go away. Maybe the rising temperature's messed with its season. Maybe the lack of fish. So far so good. You saw it? And? About five meters. I've seen bigger back home, though. How's the arm? I can paddle. -You okay? -Yeah. You're gonna have a little bump there, but it's actually not so bad. Thanks. I'll live. Jo hates the water. Always has. He almost drowned when he was a kid. I had to work on him just to get him to come on this trip. And this happens. Yeah. How'd you meet Charlie? I was… I was working at the hospital when he was brought in after his attack. It really just amazed me how calm he was. Even though he had almost lost his leg. That's Charlie for you. Do you have kids? No way. I mean, I… I'm just not ready yet. I get that. Kinda feel the same way. Are you? Yeah. When are you due? In about seven months. How far do you think we've come? Maybe 15 Ks. That's good. Yeah. Yeah, we're doing okay. Speak up, Captain. What are you saying? I said we've still got over 130 Ks to go. What was that? There. -There. -Shark! Jo. -Sit down, ya numb nut! -Fuck off! Leave us alone! It's a dolphin. Jo. Sit down. It's a dolphin. Oh, my God. Fuck, Jo! You scared the hell out of me. What? What if you'd fallen overboard? Yeah. Yeah. You're right. How many more of these do we have? That's the last one. You know sharks, right? I thought I did. And like you pointed out, I'm the investment analyst. You know what that means? What it is I do? I study situations, weigh up the odds, and then based on the facts, I predict the outcomes. You say you're a good marine biologist. Well, I'm a good… Very good analyst. A clinical assessment of our situation as I see it is, if the shark is still out there, I'd rate our chances of all surviving at less than 5%, and that would be fucking optimistic. So, do you think it's gone? -I really don't know. -Bullshit! You said they're not normally out here, and that thing is and it's killing people. It's not gone. He knows it, and so does she. -What do you want from me? -The fucking truth. Okay. It's still out there. And it's close. Hey. That's enough. I can go a while longer. Give me your hands. Thank you. Shit! Michelle. I think I dropped the paddle. -What do you mean? -I'm not sure. I was paddling and it just seemed to come out of my hand. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I got it. There! I'm sorry. I'm… Kaz! Kaz! No, no, no! I'll be fine. I'm fine. Come on, Kaz. Come on, Kaz. Come on. She's almost there. -Kaz, come on. -Come on, Kaz. Come on. Come on, Kaz. Son of a bitch. Kaz! Kaz, come on! Kaz, move it! -Come on, Kaz! Move it! -Move, Kaz! Up, up, up! Shit. Here, put these on. They'll keep you warm. Thanks. Here, let me help you with that. Take your hands off my wife! Back off. What'd you say? Hey, Benny. I said take that rod out of your arse and use it to paddle. -Benny! Hey, Benny! -What the fuck is wrong with you! -Benny! -Jo! -Benny. -Where is he? Benny. -Benny, come on. -Come on. Benny! Benny, come on! Benny. -My arm. -Come on. Hey, look at me. Come on, Benny. Come on, Benny. Right here. Look at me, Benny. Come on. -Almost there. -Got you. Come on. Come on, almost there. Give me your hand. Got you. Come on, mate. Let's get you in. Benny! -Fucking idiot! -Don't, don't, don't! Don't. He's not worth it. Benny. I had him. I had his hand. If I could've just held on to him a little bit longer, I think I could-- Stop. Stop. It wasn't your fault. Hey, Michelle. Just one mouthful. Thanks. If I could get close enough… Its brain is small, set between the eyes in the middle of the skull, which is pretty much unprotected. If I got this in the right place… it might work. You'd have to be really close. That's the tricky bit. That's a terrible idea, Charlie. I didn't say it was a good plan. Please. Jo. Jo. Here. Have a rest. Thank you. Charlie. Get back to the raft! Everyone get the fuck out of the water! Jo! It's coming! Over here, Jo! Jo! -Move, Jo! -Over here! -Jo, move. -Jo, no. -Move! Jo, move. -Move it! Jo! Jo, swim. Swim to us now. We're coming, Jo. Come on, swim, Jo. Jo, swim. Jo! Jo! No! Easy, easy. Easy, Michelle. Easy. No. He's gone. Kaz? Hey, Kaz? Kaz, look at me. Hey. -Look at me. -I'm okay! Jo. Jo. He… He's alive, he's… He's alive, he's… Come on, Jo! Jo! Quickly. Jo, Jo, quickly, quickly. Jo, it's okay, we're gonna get you. Please… Help me. Please. Jo, no! Please look after him, Grandfather. Michelle? Michelle. Michelle? We can't give up. We have to keep trying. We can still survive. Okay? Like my grandfather did. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It punctured the raft. We're losing air. If we do nothing, we die. But if we keep this bloody thing moving… there's still a chance that we can make it home. Why don't you both just rest a while? No, it's okay. We can keep going. Kaz, just rest a while. The current's taking us the right way. I'm fine. Just take a breather, sweetheart. We're doing okay. Shit. Charlie. It's all right. Keep still. If it comes close enough, I might have half a chance. Keep still. Where is it? I don't know. Where is it? I can't see it. Come on, damn it! Charlie, what? What? Fuck no. They're hunting in packs. I love you. Where is he? In the middle. It's all right. The shore. I can see the shore. There. Oh, my God, we're gonna make it. -We're gonna make it. -Charlie. We did it, Charlie. We did it. All right, come on, let's go. Fuck. What do we do? We're sinking. Charlie, this raft is not gonna make it to shore. What are you doing? Charlie. You girls are gonna make a run for it. Whatever happens, just don't look back. Just get to shore. Just get yourselves out of here. Charlie? No. Together. We do this together. Okay? I'm supposed to look after you. Together. Always together. Okay. Here. You get one in its mouth or eye, I'll go for the brain. Take one out, then we'll go for the other, okay? Okay, you swim. Just get to the land. Ready? Yeah. Come on, you fucking prick! Come on! Michelle, swim! Now! Swim! Come on. Come on! Now! No! Charlie! No! Kaz! Oh, my God. Come here! Come on! Kaz! Come on. Oh, my God. Where's Charlie? Michelle! Kaz! Shit. Michelle. When I tell you to, swim to the shore as fast as you can. You? I'll be right behind you. Now! Go now!
