Do you reckon you'll make a good lawyer? Well yeah. I've never really understood the law. I mean if everybody just used their common sense we wouldn't need any of it, would we? Well I think law is critical to any society. I mean without it we'd just descend into anarchy, it'd be dog eat dog. I agree that the over litigation of trivial matters and the willingness of people to just wrought the system is crippling it, but. I mean what's the difference between a ridiculous court case and a reasonable one? It's a thin line. Very fascinating, I think it's complex. Well, we're all entitled to our own opinion aren't we?
