That's Juancho. The house is huge. Yeah, it wasn't this big when I was a kid. The last things they built were the rooms upstairs and in the back, the sauna, Jacuzzi the massage room. - Wow! That's great! - It's amazing. Very relaxing. At one point my dad set up a spa and a rehabilitation center for smokers. That's great. Yeah, a group of people would come here and stay for a week and they'd stop smoking. - A tennis court and pool. - That's great! Two of them came on Saturday night... Maxi, the blond, and Tomi. They're sleeping there. And there's Diego. Fede! Is everything alright? - What's up? - I'm Germ?n. Nice to meet you. How are you? Did you sleep well? Yeah, but I went to sleep late. We stayed up late. I was really stoned. Lucho and Maxi were wasted. We were laughing our heads off. We ended up in the pool. And Juan, who was wasted too, threw Diego into the pool. - No! He must've been pissed. - Yeah, with his clothes on. I think he even had his cell phone on him. No way! Yeah, I think he did, because of how pissed off he was. Yeah, he was furious. I went away. I didn't want any trouble. That's a typical day here. Yeah, that's true. Do you want mate or coffee? I'm going to show him the room and then we'll come downstairs. Alright. Hey, man, put on some swim trunks or something. This guy goes around naked all day. Nice to meet you. Hi, what's up? - Hi, Germ?n. - How are you? Diego. Is everything alright? I went to take a dump upstairs because the other bathroom's full of puke. There too? Lucho threw up before going to sleep and it's still there... pieces of carrot and everything. And I told you to come here to relax for a few days, but that doesn't seem to be the plan for this weekend. Did you come by train? Yeah, the trip was amazing. I loved it. - Yeah, I came on that train too. - I never came on that train. - They say it's great. - Yeah. - Did you guys have breakfast? - No, but Fede's making some mate. I'm going to show him his room and then we'll come down for breakfast. Okay? 'Okay, great? Thanks. - What are you eating, Fatso? - An egg. I was hungry. What's up? I just had an awesome lucid dream. Yeah? - What does "lucid" mean? - That it's real. It's very real. What did you dream? I was in Tigre, at my sister's house, next to the river. I don't know what I was doing, or who I was with, but I was there. And? Everything was the same, the house, the grill in the backyard. I don't know why I went inside and went up the stairs. I went up three floors. But I think it's a one-story house. - What? - I think it's a one-story house. And when I got to the terrace, the water was at the level of the balcony. There was a lot of water. It was as if there were a waterfall a hundred yards away. Yeah. But I had gone up two floors so there couldn't be water on both levels, So then I realized it was a dream. And whenever I realize that, I feel like having sex... so I started walking, knowing I could wake up any minute. I passed a bridge. I went inside this place with bars, like a nightclub. And I started making out with the first chick I saw. I took off her clothes, I started sucking her tits and her pussy really hard. And the chick just stood there. You know like in dreams when the characters suddenly stop moving? - Yeah, that's weird. - Yeah. And at one point, her pussy started getting sandy... and... bam! I got up. I opened my eyes and looked at the ceiling. I thought "Damn it!" But it was cool while it lasted. The part about the sand freaked me out. Yeah. But it was so real that I can still taste her pussy. - Sweet! - It was really pink and delicious! - We have to call some girls over. - We need it, huh? Yeah. Alright. - Mario Bros isn't a cartoon, man. - Yeah it is. No, man, that's what you didn't get yesterday. Mario Bros isn't a cartoon. You guys said it was and I said it wasn't. That's why I think I didn't lose. Did you used to watch Mario Bros cartoons? It's the same thing. It's like a cartoon. You just can't admit that you lost because you couldn't guess and now you're saying that if we had told you it wasn't a cartoon, you would've guessed, and then you would've said that it's a kind of cartoon. Come on, Diego. I know you! See how competitive you are? I couldn't care less! You're the one who's competitive! I hate it when people mix up the actors, the people, with characters. One time Fatso got Jack Sparrow and when he asked if it was an actor, you said yes. No! The actor's Johnny Depp. Jack Sparrow worked as a pirate. - "Worked as a pirate"? - Yeah! Now being a pirate's a job. I hate it when you don't understand the example. It pisses me off. You're so competitive. Come on, Diego! Hey, Fatso, have you seen Fer? Fatso! The chick flirts with me when we're all working... and then she plays hard-to-get. - I mean... - Like how? We were going to Pablo's house. You know the guy with long hair? Yeah. Okay, Pablo, Agus, the chick and me. Pablo and Agus went to buy some beer and the girl and I were alone. I sat next to her because she wanted to show me a message and the girl gave me the cold shoulder. She was cold as ice. She went to the bathroom. She always act like that, hysterical. The next day at work, in front of everyone, she walked in, kissed me here and gave me a neck massage. She always does the same thing. She's crazy. Forget about her. Yeah. - Have you guys seen Fer? - No. So? Are you sure the girl doesn't know you're in a relationship? No, man, I'm sure. Girls find out about those things. There's no way she could know. And I don't think the guys told her, because they know I want to screw her... Right. - It's okay. - Yeah. But you have a girlfriend. To each his own. - I found this one. - Yeah. But it's almost empty. The mosquitoes are killing me. Here you go... As soon as I came in they started to bite me too. They bit you all over! Look here... No way, man! They bit me all over! Here... Here... And here too. As I was saying... Diego and Juan the longest. I've them since we were in kindergarten. But we're all very good friends. We met the rest later on. In primary school, we met Lucho, Leo and Tomi. And Maxi used to go out with Tomi's sister. He used to play soccer with us all the time, so we started getting along really well with him. And we met Fatso in eleventh grade. I think he had failed five or six times. We lost track. Yeah, you can tell he's older. And you're not going to meet Santiago today, because he moved to Spain when he met a Spanish girl here. He used to come back every two or three months, but then he started coming here less frequently. I don't think he'd come back now, if he didn't come back two years ago. Leo... Hi. Well, I'm going to the pool. You do karate with Fer, right? It's not karate, you idiot. - It's the same thing. - It's not the same thing. Yeah, I used to do karate, but when I moved to Adrogu?, I started doing taekwondo, because that's all they had there. I did it to do some kind of sport. I don't like it that much. I don't have a belt or anything. I don't know if I'm going to get different color belts. You work at the pool bar at San Martin Square, right? Yeah. We saw you there one day with Fer, right? Yeah, actually, that's where we met. We started talking a lot and he told me to try out the club, so we became friends. Are you studying anything? I used to study architecture and I dropped out. - Where? - In La Plata. - Nice! - Yeah, I liked it... I like to draw, but I'd rather draw things like comic book illustrations... Real drawings. So anyway... I'd love to draw for a living. But it's very hard to find the right connections. - Fer has a big comic book collection. - Yeah. Have you guys seen it? It's huge! Yeah. - Should I roll a blunt? - Please. Yeah, okay. Hey, what's up? Is everything alright? Yeah. THE CATCHER IN THE RYE Are you enjoying it? It's awesome. He's a great writer. Yeah, he is. What are you doing, man? Lucho, you were a total chicken! I'd be scared of Fatso too. Yeah, man, stop overdoing it. It's not a World Cup. You kick too hard. I said I'm not gonna beat you up because you're weak, but if you keep bothering me, I'll beat the crap outta you. So are your friends coming here on Saturday or not? You always act like you're faithful, but you're dying to meet those girls. What the hell? You're So 93V! Shut up! Don't be gay! I just want some eye candy, that's all. But are they coming? When they saw there were eight of us, they left early. Well, Maca said she wasn't coming, but if we throw a party, she'll come with more friends. The other day, it was eight of us against four. There can't be two of us for each. It's not like we're going to make porn. - But Juan screwed one of them. - Yeah. They're no prudes. I didn't screw the other one because she knows I have a girlfriend, otherwise, I would've done it. Totally. - Did you buy chocolate milk? - Yeah. Hey, Germ?n, are you in a relationship? He's Fer's boyfriend. Are you jealous, you cocksucking pussy? No, I'm single. If I looked like Brad Pitt and girls hit on me like they probably hit on this guy, I wouldn't stop fooling around until I'm in my forties and then I'd start thinking about a relationship. You always want a girlfriend to cheat on her with sluts. The only faithful guy here is Tom?s. I'm pretty faithful too, man. Yeah, right. It's not like girls are faithful either. I don't believe that at all. Of course not. They're just like us, or worse. They're just really sly. They get away with it and you never find out. I don't know what's up with the guy. What I do know is that he doesn't have a girlfriend. I'm not making it up, man. Why did he invite me? I don't know. Your head would explode if you were here. They walk around naked all the time. Hey, today they asked me if I was in a relationship... and I said no. No, man. I didn't lie. They didn't ask me if I had a girlfriend. No, I didn't lie. And Fer was just listening. Are you stupid? Fer's the guy. If some chicks come here and he screws one of them, I'll just die. Yeah. I don't know. I'm just going to stay here. I'm going to play dumb for a while and see what he does. I don't know. You're so stupid. Okay, bye. We- Bye. Hi. - How are you? - Fine. Great. Sorry to bother you, but I'm about to make a barbecue and we don't have any newspapers. - Do you have any? - Yeah, I'm sure we have some. - I'll bring you some. - Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine. - There are so many of you. - Yeah. - Nice weather, huh? - Yeah. How are the girls? Fine. You should make them wear sunscreen. The sun's really burning. Yeah, I know. But they're inside right now, otherwise they can't get to sleep at night. There he is. - Is this enough? - Yeah, this is great. - Yeah? - Thanks. If you need more, just let us know. - Okay, thanks. - Bye. 'BYE, guys! 'BYE-bye. She was cute! Really cute! You voted for the wrong guy, admit it. I don't know. I have no idea about politics. I shouldn't have even told you. If you have no idea, you should go and ask. I'm not saying you have to understand, but you're old enough to not vote for just anyone. You're not choosing where you're going to go on vacation. Right? There's a whole bunch of stuff at play. You should've asked me about it, or your dad. Well, not your dad... But you should've asked around a little, so at least you know what you're voting for. Or would you screw a girl without a condom just because she says she's on the pill? It depends how hot she is. - But that's a bad example. - Why? Because you supposedly trust the girl. You don't think she's gonna lie to you. But if you vote for the wrong person, you end up taking it up the butt. They say they're gonna give you a back massage and they end up sticking it up your butt. If they stick it up your butt, at least it should be because you want to feel it inside. Hey, you really look Argentinian. What do you mean? - What do you look like? - Spanish. And me? French. All you need is a beret and a paintbrush. What about me? Italian. Fatso looks Russian. Tom?s looks Arabian. Leo looks German and Diego looks Swedish. What do I look like? You look English. You look like an English soccer player. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty! What's the matter with you? You're always cheating! - What happened? - Did you hear that? You're always cheating, man! You can't play like that! Stop! Stop it, Leo! You moron! Who are you calling a moron? He's an idiot! He keeps cheating! I can't play like this! - Stop it, Leo. - Relax... Stop it! Stop, Leo! It's not a championship. You get too worked up. They why are we playing? Take it easy! And you too! I'm gonna score. Pass the blunt, man. You're smoking it all by yourself. Don't get upset, man. We were just playing and you got really pissed off! But if we're playing and you cheat, it sucks. You can't do that! - Stop being such a pussy! - What are you talking about, asshole? We were just fooling around for a while! - You're a jerk, man. - Go fuck yourself! Let me have some. Mother fucker... Milo Manara. Milo Manara? Don't you know him? He's an Italian... A genius. My dad had a bunch of his comic books. I know the classic ones more, the American ones. - Like this one. - Yeah. My dad had all of Manara's comic books and Fierro's. That's cool. I used to take them from my dad when I was a kid, because... there were naked people in them. They would really turn me on. At first I thought Milo Manara was the name of the main character, but when I was older I realized it was the name of the artist. Actually, "Click" is his most well-known comic... Well the one I know the best. It was about a guy who had put a device in a girl... and he'd click a remote control that would make her have orgasms. He'd click it and she'd have an orgasm. And he'd spy on her. It was amazing. It blew your mind. Actually, I should ask my dad for it and read it again, It's crazy... crazy. When I was in school, I used to draw a lot of superheroes. One day, some friends of mine made a magazine. It was a school magazine... It was a magazine for the school, like an alternative magazine. Yeah. And one day they asked me to do a two-page comic. I had to do everything... The drawings, the dialogs... The whole comic, you know? - And did they publish it? - Yeah. - That's cool! - Yeah, really cool. To see your work published. Yeah. And what I would do was... I used to use other people's material a little... Actually, I mostly adapted story lines from short stories, like Cort?zafls. Cool! It was cool, because they were superheroes, but with a more surrealist style... Like the characters' background. Yeah, it was like a dream. It was cool. Amazing. Do you want to go to sleep? Yeah... Okay. Hey, Leo... Leo... Come on, Leo. Go to your bed. Come on, Leo. This guy always does the same thing. Okay, I'll go sleep downstairs. - See you tomorrow. - Alright. Guada? - Yeah. - What's the matter? She wants me to go with her to the party, But that's not it. I know her. She's jealous. She asked me if there were any girls here. She doesn't believe me when I say that no girls came over, none of your friends. We spent two great weeks in Ostende, but now she doesn't understand that I want to be with you guys. It's not that I don't want to be with her. She's great. You know her. She's really sweet, but she can be really insecure and it gets on my nerves. I know I have my flaws, but I don't get jealous. You shouldn't pay attention to her. It's her problem, man. Let her figure it out, even if it hurts. What are you going to do? Go back to Buenos Aires? You're going to get upset and you won't be able to relax. Because you're fine here with us. So you're going to be pissed off and you guys are going to fight. Tomi... Forget it. Don't forget that you met her when you were with Lucia. So it's natural that she'd be scared and insecure. Yeah, I know that, but... I really love her. I'd die if I couldn't be with her. Hey, man... Germ?n's pretty weird. I just went into Fer's room and he was going through his bag. I can't believe you, man. You're always making things up. Fernando and that guy have been training together all year. Fer told me he really trusts him. You're just a cocksucker, that's the problem. So you make things up. I know you. Look at Diego going through my bag. Is this your bag? Hey, what T-shirts did you bring? Can I borrow one? But give it back to me later. The other day you were wearing a sweatshirt of mine that I had been looking for for a long time. Yeah, laugh all you want. It's true. I just love your clothes. Okay, stop looking through my stuff. I'll show you. - Alright, alright! - Don't go through everything. - Alright... - I don't like it. There you go. Thanks. It's really hard for me not to get upset. No one's faster than him, man! The guy's effective. He doesn't have to make any fancy moves. They guy's straightforward. He's simple. That's why he's the best. Yeah, but you used to say that Maradona was the best and now because you read a couple of interviews... Yeah, I did read a couple of interviews, but I've also watched him and he doesn't put on a show for the cameras like the rest. He's simple and quick and it's also a generational thing. Times have changed. And I don't agree with the idiots who say he scores goals abroad - and here he sucks. - Yeah, well. People who say that are idiots. Don't you think? - The guys are here with pastries. - Awesome! - How are you guys? - Cool! What's up, guys? You wouldn't believe the accident there was around the corner. - It's awful. - Really? Yeah, yeah. - What happened? - A crash. Hey, Fer, where are we going tomorrow? I don't know. Wherever you guys want? We could go to that nightclub with the pool in the middle that the guy fell into with all his clothes on. Otherwise, we can go to the capital and come back at night. Are you crazy? You want us to go to the capital? Let's go somewhere nearer, otherwise Fer and Leo won't be able to drive, they won't be able to drink anything. Do you want us to come back wasted like the other day, when we almost got ourselves killed? Hey, I'm not dangerous. I don't drink anymore. Yeah, right. Hey, man, this meat's like butter. Don't you think? The other day, Diego and I bought meat at the supermarket and it wasn't like this at all. This is totally different. Yeah. And you ate three sausages, you cocksucker. You must be full. That butt sure imports a lot of meat. He gave it to me, you idiot. You're the weirdest vegetarian I know. You never eat meat; You're always really fussy, but you eat barbecue. But I never say I don't eat meat. I don't go around telling people that I'm vegetarian. But it's true. I hardly ever eat meat. Only when there's barbecue. The other day, Redo and X went to a restaurant and we ordered meat. But you bother me so much about it. I can eat meat wheneverl feel like it. So does you girlfriend eat your meat? Of course she does. She eats it whole. What about you? You should probably get a girlfriend too. How long has it been since this guy had sex? Like four months. You can't get a girl to save your life. You don't have to be so mean. Today's December 6, my mom's birthday. I have to call her. Lucho's always teasing Leo, you know? Do you think Leo's really gay? I don't know. Maybe. The guy's weird. He's always been weird. The two girlfriends he had were the only chicks he's ever screwed. Plus, sometimes he just stares at you. It's weird. And you don't know if he's looking at you, at him... or if he likes you. I don't know. That's what I think. Yeah, yeah. I agree. I don't know. It's also weird that his two girlfriends are the only girls he's ever screwed. Now he's with this chick, Rocio... but Rocio used to go out with Mono and Mono says she never wanted to have sex. So I don't know. - I have an aunt who's a lesbian. - Yeah. She says that if you're really bisexual, you have no trouble repressing yourself, because since you like girls and guys, if you meet a guy, it doesn't matter, you can be with him and then go satisfy your needs with a chick. It's no big deal. It's easy to repress. So you just leave him there and that's it. He's going to be the first to get married, - whether he's gay or not. - Yeah, maybe. And we're going to be there celebrating it with presents, dancing at his wedding. It's true. You know I love Romi... but I can't say no to girls who call me for sex. The other day, Romi had to get some paperwork done. She went to sleep at her house because it was closer to where she had to go the next day. It's like she's a witch. I don't know if this girl is psychic or what... Natalia texted me. Remember Natalia, the skinny girl? Remember? The skinny girl? You wouldn't believe what she looks like now. She's got a lot more meat on her bones and a great rack. Man! I took a cab and went to her house and we fucked for nine hours. Of course. What was I supposed to do? It's natural. Then I got home and took a shower... and I felt like shit. I felt really guilty. It sucks. The important thing is that Romi doesn't catch you, because then you'll want to kill yourself. Hey, I think Germ?n is kind of gay. You'd know if he was for sure. It takes one to know one. Stop it, man. Hey... You keep calling me "cocksucker" all day long. "Cocksucker, cocksucker, cocksucker." You don't realize it, but it gets annoying. I'm sick of it. Plus, I have a girlfriend. You don't realize I'm just kidding around. Hey, stop! I was here first! Diego, I'm gonna use your shampoo; It's great! Okay. Fer, I'm going to take a shower here, because Lucho's using the shower downstairs and he takes an hour. Alright! What are you reading? "Hunger..." It's Norwegian. I'm going in now. Are you gonna take much longer? No, come in if you want. Son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick your ass! Come on, man! We were in tenth or eleventh grade and we were really stoned. It was one of the first times we all smoked together. We were in... Fatso's grandma's house... in the yard. At one point I went to his grandma's room. She had died recently... And I saw Leo there... and Fer, making out in the room. We were just kids and we were stoned. Besides, we had to experiment a little, right? No, but I don't think we were making out, man. No, I totally remember. We were making out. It was my bisexual phase. Now I'm totally gay. No, wait a minute. I really don't remember that. I think we must've been so stoned that we imagined it, but that's all, man. Well, everyone should be able to do whatever they want. It's like Juan says, the more gay guys there are, the more girls there are for us. The other day, Fatso and I were at Serrano and he was totally freaking out. "This place is full of gay people! Cocksuckers!" and Juan said "Take it easy, Fatso." The more gay guys there are, "the more chicks there are for us to choose from." That's how it is. Last time we were... I don't get people who think that if you go to a gay bar all the guys are going to hit on you. It's not true. Gays play hard-to-get more than girls. I swear it's true. The other day Her and X went to a parky full of gay Peronists... You know she's an activist there? And I looked like the gayest guy in there, with the shirt I was wearing. I'm serious. No one gave me the time of day. They don't even look at you. That's how it is. Wait... Okay, but where are you guys now? Yeah, obviously, man. Yeah. But stay there at the gas station. I'll be there in half an hour. Okay? Yeah... Alright, man. Alright! Maxi... Maxi, come with me to pick Fatso up. He's with Juan. The girls left him there. They went to another party. Maxi... What? Did they have sex? Fatso said he did. He screwed her in a bathroom. But Juan didn't. He just made out with her in the yard. Come on, man. Let's go. - I'm exhausted, man. - Come on! Don't be inconsiderate! Stop bothering me, man. - Come on, man! Come on! - Alright! Let's go. Listen, now you guys go out and play soccer and let Andrea clean up, please. Okay, but Fede's lying down because he doesn't feel well. But he won't get in the way. In any case, she can just not clean that room. Of course, that's no problem. Who? The boy with the blue eyes? Germ?n, a friend of mine from Taekwondo. He came to our house several times. You've seen him, right? Yeah, but I didn't know he was everyone else's friend too. No, he's my friend. But I told him to come along. Because he was going to go to the South with a couple of friends and they started dating. They told him they wanted to go alone, so he had nowhere to go on vacation. Text me when you finish, okay? I left you your pay for last week and today. Okay. - Are you alright, Andrea? - Yeah, everything's fine. - You got my number, right? - Yeah. Okay. You can send me a missed call if you want, so... I'll call you later. I have two kids, you know? I'm separated, but I've got two kids. I can be a good dad if you give me a chance. What are their names? Lucas and Manuel. - Six and four. - Nice names. Out! Out! Damn it! Fuck! - Juan... - What? Roll another one. But there's only enough for one more. Ger... Didn't you have a friend who's staying near here who had weed? Yeah. He's near here... Twenty minutes away. Tell him to bring some and we'll buy some from him. No, he'll bring me some. It's no problem. He has a bunch of plants. He's really cool. And he's totally out of his mind. HEY, guys... Let's go buy meat early tomorrow, because the other day we got there late and there was none left. Hey, Fer! Do you want to go? - Yeah, alright. - Okay. Hey, Lucho fell asleep. Let's take some pictures of him and post them for the group. What kind of group? A whatsapp QFOUP? Yeah. We always take pictures of Lucho. Hey... Fer... I'm serious. I'm going to wake you up early tomorrow. Don't stay up too late. Well, do whatever you want. But I'm waking you up early tomorrow. Okay, you can come jump on me if I don't wake up. Okay. We- Bye. They're always playing pranks on Lucho, huh? Yeah. But he's the worst of them all. One summer, Juan got pictures of him taking a dump in Fatso's bag. He didn't care. Fede got his cell phone and started taking pictures. And one year later, Fede found the pics and he wanted to kill him. They always pull pranks like that, though. Sometimes they cross the line. Did you put some clothes in the wash today too? Yeah. I don't have any clean underwear left. It doesn't matter. I'll just go to bed like this. I saw you reading "Demian." You read a lot. I do quite a lot of reading myself, but I think you beat me. No, only when I'm on vacation. During the year... I don't have time to read anything. It's really hard. You know what I started doing? It's great. I go out without a backpack and with a book. So since I don't have a backpack, I carry them around in my hand. When I'm on the subway, the bus, or getting paperwork done, I read them and that's how I finish them quickly. So anyway... What about "Demian"? Had you read it before? Yeah... but I started looking into it and I found out that it's Hesse's story. It's his story. Actually, you know what he did? He published the book with the name of the main character: Sinclair. And then he said it was about him, so they started to publish it as "Hesse." I had already read Steppenwolf and... And... the one about Buddha... Siddhartha. Siddhartha, yeah. Besides, I read it when I was fourteen. A long time ago. So I felt like reading it again. When I... When I read it, I thought he was in love with Demian. Yeah, it's a bit like that. I'm totally in love with her. I want to marry her. I don't really mind her fits of jealousy. I can handle it. As long as I don't give her reasons to be suspicious and start imagining things, I think she'll get over it. - Yeah, I know you like her. - Yeah, I love her! But she keeps asking me if there are women here, if any girls are going to come over. She said she's going to drop by unexpectedly. - You don't know when. - I don't know. She can come. What's the problem? I don't know... But anyway... She's not dumb. She knows that there are going to be women here sometimes, friends of yours. Yeah. But I think that if I don't give her any reason to be suspicious, she'll start to relax. I don't know. But I totally understand her. Why? Because her ex boyfriend cheated on her with her friend. No! - What a jerk! - No wonder! - Now she's traumatized. - Of course. She's paranoid that the person she's with will cheat on her. That's why she asks me all the time and calls me. - But the guy's an asshole. - Yeah, he's an asshole. And so is her friend. Her too. What a bitch! - I think you shouldn't play along. - Yeah. Right. I'd just want to have a girlfriend so I don't get the blowfish anymore. That's was a good one. That's a good one. What? The blowfish! You're terrible. You love to cum inside, man. I'm serious, man. Stop it. One day someone's gonna go to your house late at night, ring the doorbell and say "Juan, this is your kid." Kid, this is your dad. You have to take care of him." You'll want to kill yourself! Knock on wood, man. What are you talking about? I will, but you have to take care of yourself. He's right. Yeah, man. Wear a condom. I'm going to wake Fer up. Alright, alright. Do you want some coffee? Yeah, okay. I'll be right down. Fer... Hey. Fer... Hey! Wake up. Let's go buy some meat. Come on! Hey! Fer! Come on, dude! Wake up! Come on, you cocksucker! Wake up! Come on! Come on! I'm going to jump on you! Come on! Come on, cocksucker! Come on! Hey! Fer! Hey! Okay, alright. I'll be waiting for you downstairs. Come on, cocksucker! Ger, are you in there? Yeah. - Diego woke you up, right? - Yes. Okay, I'm going to go shopping with him and I'll see you later, okay? Okay. Hi. Hi. How are you? How was your trip? Hi. What are you doing here, honey? You look beautiful. Did you come here by yourself? No, I came with Carla. With Carla? You're not mad, are you? I don't know, honey. I'm really sleepy. Just let me sleep. You're so beautiful. Are you happy I came? I'm really sleepy, honey. Stop asking me that. Pass it to me! Under the bridge... It's great. I can tell you what I think... Hey, Fer... What's up with Germ?n? What do you mean "what's up"? I don't know. You tell me. I think you guys look like you make a good karate duo. We always look like the ones who are desperate to have kids, but that's because you guys can have kids your whole lives and we can't. For example, my cousin and my sister are always making calculations. You take one year to meet someone, two years to get along well and three years to move in together. But if things don't work, you're back where you started, and then you've wasted three years of your life. I don't know. The reality is that you guys can have kids with the first woman you meet at whatever age. You can have a kid at 50 if you're with a young woman. Tom?s' face talking about kids. No, I ask her about it more than she says. I say we should have them now when we're young. But she wants to go to school and all that, right? It's true. If it were up to me, I'd have kids right now. Now! Last year, my boyfriend and I went backpacking to the south, to Rinc?n del Azul. Do you know it? - Yeah. - It's great! Because there are refuges in that area where you can stay for as many days as you want. The water there is turquoise. That place is amazing. You know where you really have to go? To the North, the whole Northern area... Purmamarca, Humahuaca... I have a bunch of contacts at the hostels there. If you want, I'll give you my whatsapp number - and send you all the information. - Okay, yeah. What I really want to see, even though it's more expensive, is Chile. I'm dying to go there. I want to go to Puc?n, Villarica... and then go down to Valdivia. I went there when I was a kid, with my parents. But I don't remember anything. I remember a fish market and the sea lions that were there, lying in the sun. People would feed them. Do you want me to give you my whatsapp number now so we don't forget? - Okay. - Yeah? Hi! What are you guys doing? No, come over here. We're having a blast! Okay, go get Luli and all of you come over. The house is great. Fer said we can all stay in his mom's room. Yeah... We're with Fede, Diego, Maxi... Yeah. They're the guys you met at Centenario Park. Remember? They're not annoying at all. I'm here with Carla... and we're having the best time. The best time. Come on. It's a lot more fun. Really, the house is huge and they'll leave us two or three bedrooms. Stop it! Okay. Alright. Shut up! Alright, bye. Well? Well? They're not coming. I know them. They're not gonna come. Why did you have to whisper all the time, Fatso? I just said we have a tennis court and a pool! They heard you, Fatso! Tom?s... I'm taking the toothbrush, okay? Sleep well. Do you want to go to sleep? Okay, yeah. Are you still in a relationship? Yeah. - You too, right? - Yeah. We're actually thinking about moving in together. Really? So are we. But we're just starting to talk about it. But it's a big step. Yeah. It's kind of like getting married. - I don't know... - But it's cool. I don't know if it's cool to think about it like that. But yeah, I don't know. So are you faithful? As much as possible. I'm gonna wake him up. No, no, no! Don't do that. - Come on! - No! He won't wake up. - Yeah! - Okay, do whatever you want. They always take your bed. What do we do? We can sleep in your bed. Okay. You sleep on the side of the wall, okay? Should I turn off the lights? Yeah. Fer... - Hey, man... - What's the matter? Come with me to get some pastries. Lucho took my car to take Guada's friend to the capital. Just go on foot. Come on, man! Take me in your car. Just go on foot. It's really nearby. I'm not going to go on foot. Come on, get up! I always go. You guys are so lazy! I'll go with you. What happened? The chick's amazing! We were making out next to the tennis court. At one point, she looks at the shed and says "What's in there?" And that was it. She pulled down my pants and started sucking my cock... It was awesome! Then I went to the bedroom to get the condoms and this idiot didn't want to give me any. Nah... But I thought the girl was really faithful, or at least that's what Guada says. Maybe since both of them are in a relationship, she didn't care. But if Lucho hadn't told me that he saw it, I wouldn't have believed it. Why were you spying on us, you cocksucker? If I had seen you, I would've beaten the crap outta you. I'm serious. That's not right. You screwed the girl I'd been flirting with all afternoon, with my condoms... The least I could do was watch her in action a little. You always say Leo's a cocksucker, but you were watching her suck on my cock. Yeah... Yeah right, you cocksucker. You perverted voyeur. What's the matter with you? I'm pissing myself. Are you coming with me? Hey, Fer's a good fighter, right? We don't fight. We just train. But Fer's the best. Everyone loves him. He wouldn't hurt a fly. When we were kids and we went out dancing, a couple of times we got into fights with people. But he was always there for us. He'd always defend us... Anyone. He was always the first one to defend anyone. It's too bad... he's head over heels in love with a friend of my girlfriend's. It's been ages, but he's still in love with her. The four of us used to double date. We went on vacation together once. But since the girl left him, he hasn't been with anyone else. It's crazy. - Didn't he tell you? - No. No, I didn't know. Yeah, he's head-over-heels in love. He doesn't even talk about the girl though, you know? He didn't tell you, but I know. I've known Fer for a long time and I know he's in love. Even though he doesn't mention her. He's crazy about her. If the girl wanted to get back together with him, he wouldn't think twice. I'm sure he wouldn't. Hey, your friend, the one with the weed, is here. - Seba? - Yeah. He looks like a real bum. - Did he tell you anything? - No. Thanks, Seba. Awesome. I came in, he opened the door... And when I saw all those straight guys in the pool, I almost died. One of them, the big blond guy, was in his underwear. He took it off and put on his bathing suit. I went crazy. They said "Get in the pool." I thought if I got in the pool, I'd turn into a mermaid and I'd be exposed. I'm dying to have sex with all of them. So what's up with that guy? Fernando, right? Yeah. I don't know what's up with him. I'm kind of confused. I don't get it. We're together all the time and he keeps looking at me. He laughs a lot. Last night we slept together and in the middle of the night, I felt his hard cock against my leg. But I don't know, because we were sleeping. You're slow. I would've gone down to drink from the hose. No, no, no. I don't know. I was just talking to Leo, the guy we came with, and he confused me even more. That Leo guy stares a lot. I think he's gay. I don't know. That's the impression I got. I think he's gay too. You suck, Fatso! There's the fucking ball, you idiot! - Take it easy! - He said I suck! Relax, Diego! Who do you think you are? Messi? Milky butt. Here you go, Meathead. There you go, you idiot! He's been cheating all day! And you guys don't say anything. You play dumb too. Shut up, man! Don't tell me to shut up! Forget it. Hi! - How are you, Piojo? - What's up? Everything's fine. (How are you guy's WW?)? The cops took our bags like they were going to check them. I wasn't worried, because I didn't have anything at the time. But at one point, someone started talking louder in another language. That made us more nervous because we couldn't understand what they were saying. I turn around and I see a huge blonde woman with my jean jacket in her hand... She was holding it as if it were dirty. And in the other hand, she was wearing a blue glove and holding some shrooms, like evidence. When I saw that I realized that I had something... But when I saw the jacket, I realized that I had had that jacket for five years and I hadn't washed it, so those shrooms had been in there for a long time. They were all old and dry, so they weren't effective anymore. They analyzed them and realized there was no problem. They had us there for a while... In the end we even laughed about it together and that was it. They let us go. So luckily I'm here and I can tell about it. I'm free. So I brought you a couple of... a couple of interesting things for you to have fun tonight. So enjoy it. We can get in the pool later, if you want. Do you want to go to the pool? - Okay. - Let's go. - Is my eye red? - Let me see. Lucho... - Did you guys get some rest? - Yeah. The guys already left. They didn't want to wake you up. Leo got up early and started getting on our nerves. He took everyone, Maxi, Fede... We're going to go back in a van later. You have to leave the car to your Mom, right? Yeah, because she needs it. We'll help you clean up later. Are you staying till tomorrow? Yeah. I'll clean up with him. We'll be back in a while. See ya. - Do you wanna go? - Let's go. - Ready? - Yeah. One, two, three. Did you have a good time? Yeah... I had a great time. Can I kiss you?
