Prettier women are gonna pop out... Why do you think husbands have mistresses? When a man... When a man plans his life with a woman it's because he's gonna commit. Good one. He's drunk already! When he gets the burger and the taco everyday, he's going to want something else. Hey Don Mundo... don't hide from me. Not gonna repeat it. Are you Marisol? Mundo sent you this, he says you should check your Facebook. Psst! Where is he? At the hill with Don Leo. What else did he say? Hey kid! Six corpses, 53 injured civilians, 55 injured policemen, several by gunshot... and 21 arrested. Hacienda Blanca, at the city of Oaxaca's entry... since early morning, was the scenery of the blockage made with stones, tires and tractors. Mauro is not... going to forgive me and you don't even show up, bastard. Are you scared? FUCK IT let's go. Get in! Come on! Shoot what? Guns. Or are you afraid? Mundo told me that there is no legitimate fortune in these lands. It got me thinking. I dreamt I was holding a gun... I wasn't scared. I will always love you. No. Get the fuck out! Got you. Weren't you brave? Wanna try? Never put your finger in here. You put it here only if you're gonna shoot. If you're not, goes in here all the time. OK? Here. Tight. Always hold it tight... so if anything happens, pum pum! Hey dude! I'm looking for a phone around here. Give it to me, bitch! Give me your fucking phone! See guys? That's how you do it... quickly, easy, done. Don. Look at them, Don Leo. Is that all? But we can get more. When? No, no, what do you mean "when"? Let's go right now and close the road. Look at them... do you know how many are we? Look! And you can't have this at everyone's sight. Bury them or hide them. But we don't have anywhere to put them. What about Mauro's workshop? Closing a road is not that simple, Mauro. Alright then. Let's go! If you get involved with Marisol again I will fuck you up, scumbag. She's my cousin and has always been my property. - Get off me, fucker! - So what? This is only between Marisol and me. So fuck off. You've been warned. What happened to you Marisol? You got hit, didn't you? Can you walk? I'm going to help you. Do you want water or something? Tell me, whatever you want. They hit you really hard, Marisol... you shed a lot of blood. What are we gonna do now? I'm gonna run get the priest before it starts raining. You're gonna die on me, and what are we gonna do? Listen Marisol, you cannot stay in here. My child, please... I'm trying to get a phone to text you. I've no idea how to give you this letter, or where to find you, nothing. I don't know your route and I can't go to the workshop because fucking Mauro is gonna be there. I'm going to fix your wound, it's a nasty one. Hey sister, pass me the gauzes, they're on the table! Let's go get Mauro and cut his ear off then... This fucker is asking for it. Let's pay him a visit! - There he is, it's done! - Here we go, brother! Honk at that asshole, bro! - That asshole is fucked. - Honk! He's so fucked. He doesn't know who he messed with. Don Leo says you gotta stop fooling around! What the fuck? Bring the guns already! Things are heating up! And what the fuck do I have to do with that? Come on, let's go bro! Well this fucking bastard has it coming. It's done, man. Good evening. Good evening! Good evening. Evening. Someone called me. I'm sorry we called you... we had a problem with Marisol. What did she do now? We found her all trashed so we brought her here she didn't even know her name. You can come in and see her. We need you to take her but first I need you to pay for her bandages. I'll be right back. Try to escape and I'll tie you for real. Crazy nuthead. We're in deep shit, man. We? There was a shooting on the road. I know man, it's tough out there. I talked with the "huachicol" dealers, they're coming later to fill the barrels. So wait for them. You made that fucking deal, not me. But you're in the workshop too man, not just me, asshole. I know man, but I get no money... When are you closing? - Huh? - What time are you closing, asshole? The fuck you care. OK, OK, OK. In a bit. Don't stay to drink, asshole. Yes boss! Too many fucking glances, fuckers. Eat up. And I'll tell you this: Mundo is lying to you... and you keep believing him. Am I right? No one should know anything about the resistance... or you'll see what happens. Got it? Did you hear me? Eat up. Why do I keep getting in fucking chick problems? There's nothing left for me. These fuckers have taken everything from us. Mundo, bastard... Fuck yeah, man! Oaxaca is going to know what we're made of! And you fucker numbed by that shit. Leave it, man! This is it, asshole. King of the world! Take my picture, man! Come on. Take it, asshole! Look at that clown, that's why he covers his face. Mundo... bastard... I won't say this twice... I'm so sick of all your shit... I'm sending you to hell this time... Go fuck yourself, asshole. And me... stuck in here, still waiting for you to come around. I just want you to know that I'm going with Don Leo. Go figure. Stay with the fucking idiots from the workshop. Why do you go on making promises? I don't feel like hanging out with you anymore. Stop! Fucking stop! Hey! Come here, you bitch! How the fuck am I going to make you understand? Be quiet! Get in! For fucks sake... What am I going to do with you? How the fuck are you going to understand? Huh? I'm fucking talking to you! I'm talking to you! Look me in the eyes when I talk to you! Look me in the eyes! Don't you dare to get out. Where's Mauro? Your ladies are calling! Get in! The Uncle wanna talk to you about the money you owe him, asshole. Take care of her, man. Move it! - Just for a bit, fuck. - I'll be right back. Damn coward. I'm gonna be in Puerto Angel tomorrow afternoon, if I don't see you there you'll never see me again. Let's go, man. And there's this one who's very shy and quiet, her name's Nicky. Nicky? - Well, Nicole. - But she has huge tits! Stop. Hey leave her alone! We're calling the cops! Call anyone, fuck call whoever you want, fucker. - We're calling them. - Call them. Idiot! - We're going to throw you some rocks! - Leave her alone! Let's go, man. You're nothing. - He's on his way to the shop... - Let me text him. stay sharp, Maurito! Let's see if he's around. I'm just telling you, we're screwed man. There was a problem with the feds, they found out about the guns and your name came up. I told you not to mess with Marisol. You don't work here anymore. OK then... the guerrilla is over. Just like that? So easy. Well, tell them yourself then. To be honest I'm enraged, bro this fucker has fucked up a lot, I'm under a lot of pressure, man. What's up, Mundo? - Don. - You know what you're dealing with? We have the feds up our asses because of you. They're coming to get you tonight. It's better if you just leave, go north for a few months. You're no good here anymore. You're in trouble, it's best if you just disappear for a while. Sol! Sol! Come on fucker! - Get in asshole! - Marisol! Fuck, I'm coming! Well but if you gave them to her now, I guess you can get me some to take home. No, that's forbidden. Please understand, I can't give them to you without a prescription. - OK, OK, OK... - Please understand, I can go to jail... Can you help me or not? Don't get upset Don Mauro... If you can't do it I'll go to management, talk to Dr. Martínez and I'll make a deal with him, or you make a deal with him. But tell me if you can fucking help me or not. Well... I can get the prescription... Is just that, how can you help me too? If you help me I can get you anything you want. OK then. Can I go see her? Hello. At this moment. And as for the injured, well, as for this moment... the count was made approximately at eight thirty at night, and they're making another count at noon to know for sure, because there were some people... under a "severe" status, and to be certain of how their health has evolved. But... what the National Security Commission said, their officers... I told you to be careful, fuckers. There's been only six deceased so far. Thank you so much for your report, Raul... we will continue to... I'm leaving. What do you mean you're leaving? With who? With Mundo... to the guerrilla. And what do I tell your aunt if she comes? Nothing. Mundo is waiting for me... gotta go. Sol, dear... Came on a trailer... after that they put us on the train... we're arriving... around El Huizache, you know? There are no more trees in sight... and I don't feel so good. I'm sick. But now... I feel more calmed for leaving home. The key here is just to stay alert... and don't let others mess with you. I'm going... to shave... my head like a soldier my long hair... is... just... for... you. Sometimes I come here... and think about you a lot. You're still alive. I think. But the truth is I don't know. Where are you? I talk to you... I can't see you... Fuck. Oh, how much I miss you, Sol... you wouldn't believe. So much sadness. I didn't even notice... they took us through a tunnel... crossing the border is not that hard this way... it is a controlled business. They took us from Juarez to Mexicali, and then straight up to California. So now you speak English or what? I sent you lots of videos and you didn't even reply... you always leave me on "seen". I got a gardening job now... here with the blondies. I'm making six dollars an hour... but I don't know if they'll want them at the bank 'cause... I keep them in my boot and they stink real bad. Here's a picture of my fake ID, it cost 40 dollars. What do you think? I even feel Californian now. Fucking asshole... you don't even go on Facebook anymore. In trouble, right? Fuck yeah, bro. So you don't have anything to do with Mundo leaving? No, we were supposed to meet that day for... when the guns were delivered... go to the mountains. You know where he went? That's it bro, kill him already. - And what if you see him? - I'm gonna kill him. I haven't been able to text you. The migra broke into the warehouse I was staying at and... and they took everything. Look, I'm coming back soon. I'm just about to buy a truck to go see you. I swear. I'm coming. You're so mean! I checked on Mauro's Facebook to see if someone knew something about him... and there I saw your chat... YOU SHOULD SEE THE CHICKS HERE, BLONDIES, FUCKING GOOD. I DON'T EVEN LIKE THEM BLONDE. - THERE ARE DARK-SKINNED TOO. - ALL WORDS, ASSHOLE. THIS ONE'S FOR YOU, MAURITO. I don't know why you send him so much bullshit. I thought I'd be with you by now. I don't know... Fucking cops, they're patrolling all day. But I'm still here, strong. Fuck, you don't even text me anymore. Are you still on the road or...? You didn't tell me the color of your truck. Sometimes I get so nervous thinking you're already here... Happens with every truck I see. But you just don't arrive... and I'm getting all crazy. Can you see me? Fuck, I can't hear you! My little girl... Mundo... You drive me crazy... I can't stop thinking... do you remember? And I don't know... I'm in need of you all the time. I wanna see you Sol... but if I didn't call, it's only 'cause... I didn't wanted to- because of my problems, I got you in so much trouble. I know that... I need to see you. Here at the pier... even though I don't know what's going to happen anymore. If I'm gonna see you... Or if I'll run into you... I do remember the things you used to tell me... about the streets belonging to those who work it and that the rich are rich because they fuck with the poor and all those things. Let's go, sweetie! My beautiful girl, you know how much I like driving. It clears my head. I get the blues. He's messing with me all day with the things you send him on Facebook. Look at this, check out this black beauty, she's the one I like the most. What do you think? Now you see it's true. Fancy her? HERE MAURO SHOWED ME SOME PICTURES OF YOU AND SOME GRINGAS. FUCKING ASSHOLE. DON'T BELIEVE HIM. THOSE PICTURES AREN'T MINE. Voice mail. Your call will be charged after the next tone. Sol... why won't pick up? I've been driving all fucking night. Sol... why won't you pick up? I've been driving all fucking night. Fucking Mundo, why are you telling everyone you're coming back? Why are you even here? Fucking prick. Didn't you only like gringas, prick? Where do you have them? On the truck surely. And now you decided to text, didn't you? Asshole. I don't even know if I want to see you anymore. Baby girl! I love it when you're upset... I'm gonna fuck the anger out of you, you'll see! Mommy! What's up Don Leo? How's it going? Oh, fuck! I didn't recognize you. Change's good, isn't it? It is. They have us cornered here, Mundo. You should come fight with us... it's out of control now. People are really hurt, Mundo and everyone here respects you. It does sound bad Don Leo but... well I have my own business going on. Take care of your affairs then, you know you have a place here with us. Move it! Let him through. I'm losing my patience, answer me I'm begging you or I don't know what I'll do. Why won't you fucking answer me? See ya, bro. Take care! I said I don't want you get out of my life. That son of a bitch is behind this! I'm sure, motherfucker! I'm sure! That son of a bitch is behind this. I told him I didn't know anything. Wait... No girl, I... I don't want any trouble. OK? See you. Mundo! Over here! This way! You can park here! It took me long, sorry. - Where were you? - We were looking for you. I couldn't find the road. Is she in there? Marisol is in there, I gave her the keys. - I had to wait for Mauro's gorillas to... - Take her with you before Mauro arrives. OK. Mauro's looking for us. Wait... Wait! - What? - Wait... - No? - Don't move. Sweetheart... damn Marisol... We leave as soon as it gets dark. Besides, they don't even know where we are. Watch out for them! Alert, huh? Wait, wait, wait. - I'll tell you in a bit. - OK. Here I go... not this one. Let's see. Don't move the strawberry. - All of it? - Fuck me, fuck me. All in! Bottoms up! Bottoms up! I won! - I can't Mari, you know more than I do. - I won. - Yeah... - I won. Fucking bitch. Get in! OK man, go that way don't do anything stupid. And you motherfucker, follow me. I dreamt about this. If there's a problem or something go that way, OK? - Guard this side. - Yeah. OK fellas, all set let's get this asshole. - Show no fear, no pussies allowed! - Break it down! Go ahead, fuckers! Yes. We're gonna take care of each other this time. We'll leave for good. But we'll do it together now. Come, come! Stop it, you fucking Mauro! That's enough! Come on, motherfucker! Enough already! You shot Sol, you bastard! Stop it now! Calm down baby, calm... I'm going to take care of you... - Are you going to ask for my forgiveness? - Alright man, fine. Whatever you want, just take care of her... - Are you going to ask for my forgiveness? - Yes, I told you already man! - Tie him up! - Tie him from there! That's what you get for messing with someone else's chick. Fucking Mundo. Hold his feet tight, man don't let him escape. Go faster man... Come on, faster! I need water... - Sup, fucker. - I'm thirsty... You're recovering fast, aren't you? Look at this. It's for you to think about our friendship for a bit, asshole. Look. Come here, man. You crossed the fucking line, man. Are you awake? Wake up, fucker! Ain't I here taking care of you? You don't even appreciate it. Damn Marisol, she's a good girl. Is a fine woman. You're fucking everything up with her, asshole. There's still a chance to close the road... you're a soldier go back to do your thing. Otherwise that's why I'm here... to beat you up. You hear me, faggot? Tell the chanekes I said hi. Fuckers... Do you already know how to shoot? - Shoot what? - Guns! Or does it scare you? We're gonna die anyway, right? When you came to see me... was when I realized... it wasn't you. It was just another visit. Really? What are you doing here? Carlos! Go get Mauro, please! - And see who else is with him. - Alright. So what happened? That fucker did the wrong thing. Are you OK? What happened to your arm? Nothing happened, she hurt herself playing. Mauro's saying that they did something to you. Are you pressing charges? Commander! I got stuck with something, brother… I'm going to ask you not to wait for me. It's gonna be a while. Mundo... you have to leave. They're going to kill you if you don't. Marisol... Go fuck yourself, asshole! Calm down brother... fucker... I'll pay for this shit. Hey you. What are you up to? Nothing. What's up with you? I want you to get out of the house for a while... they don't wanna see you around. The thing is, they're bringing my girl and you know how her mom gets. Making up things... you know. What kind of things? She's got much imagination. I have a gift for you. I'll get dressed and then we leave, OK? Yeah. Wait for me. Sup, fucker. What do you want? It's been a long time... What's up, fucker? What's up with what, dickhead? Not bragging now? Fuck! Take that, motherfucker! Brother... Bro... Man! Take a look. They're awesome, aren't they? Should've seen the others man, those were the shit! Sol did see them on me. In fact, I ate her pussy with my golden teeth! Fucking hell... I'm gonna get my fucking fingers back on, you'll see! They can stitch them, you know? They put them back on, man. We'll see if it works. You left Mauro lying there all alone... you didn't even try to bury him... or look for me. But yeah... in the end it was better that you weren't here. Life is on hold... There are very few comrades left at the resistance. We're scared all the time. Crazy... Soldier... Hey, soldier! Poke him! Assface! That asshole... he's no good anymore. Now when I go to the beach with my friends I don't even talk about it. I just think about everything that went down. But tell us the story from the beginning! So they were drinking alcohol, and things were heating up between these guys they were messing around, and so, I don't know... they started to dare each other, and so I came up with the idea of "videoing" that show, right? Look at that dog who wants to go to the store! The dog gets happy when you sing. Even though I won the battle, my armor has worn out... I come to you... Here it comes, girls! Drown me...
