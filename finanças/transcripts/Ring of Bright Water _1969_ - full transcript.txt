- Wilcox here. - Colin? - Hello, Graham. - Want to know something? Not particularly. What? We're in the files... at least I am. Here, under M-e-r. Yes. Well, that's right, isn't it-M-e-r? You don't realize I've just seen it. I'm a code number that gets a pension. I have an expectancy of life calculated in years and days. Years? They've got to be joking where I'm concerned. I have got the mother and father of all hangovers. I've already lost half the pensionable... female population of London somewhere. We've been computerized by our own computers. What's wrong with that? Everybody has. Yes, but it makes you think when you see it for the first time in black and white. "Pension, 'X' years, finish." Who wants to know about one's future anyway? Well, fifteen years is nothing. Anyway, that was just a life expectancy. That was before pension. You'll only be... I've already worked it out. Thanks. And then what? There's all sorts of things you can do... Retire, buy a nice little place in the country... get married again... write your book about the marsh Arabs or something. That's what I should be doing now. Oh, saved my life, Flo. I'll never drink again. Cheers. Here, if I've saved your life, luv... how about buying one of these for the raffle? There's a lovely first prize in the fridge there. You were saying, Graham? Oh, yes. I was saying... Oh, I don't know. It doesn't matter. Excuse me. The winner is 1-0-0, 100. Blast. 99. Hey, Graham. 100, that's yours. Just a minute, Flo. Here you are, my love... First prize. From that first day... I imagined that the otter had somehow singled me out... from all the thousands of people... who pass the pet shop window every day. Yet I found it intriguing. It was uncanny. Every time I passed, he seemed to be watching me... and me alone. At first, I thought it was only my imagination... but whatever I did, he seemed to sense that I was there... and fix me with his beady eyes. Clearly, I was the chosen one... and I found it curiously flattering. I refused to believe... that the otter was only watching me... because he'd seen me carrying off... the most beautiful fish of his life. No, it had to be something special... and this otter had the good sense to see it. I didn't really take it seriously... and yet I had to admit... that I was feeling rather pleased with myself. Years ago, when I traveled in Arabia... I'd watched wild otters playing in the marshes. There, they had more sense of fun. They seemed very different from this one... who, like myself, was now a prisoner in London. Ja, it's OK. Nice size, good condition. I think it will fit into the act very nice. Well, as you know, Herman, I'm willing to try anything... but otters? No one does the flaming barrel-divin' act with an otter. Exactly. Frank, to see humans do it is nothing now. This is something different. Yeah, I know it's funny... but how are you going to make him do it? When I have finished with him, oh, yes, oh, yes. You see, Frank, otters love water. Hello, old chap. I called my otter Mijbil... after an Arab sheik I'd known long ago... and whose name intrigued me with an imagined picture... of a platypus-like creature. "Physical description..." "a head ill-shaped, ears placed low..." "eyes small and homely..." "a lurid aspect, awkward motions." "" The otter is naturally... "of a cruel and savage disposition..." "and has been known to sever human fingers with its bite..." "without pause for bone..." "or the pain thus afflicted." "The flesh of the otter is extremely fishy..." "and disagreeable to taste." "However, the Romish church..." "permits its consumption on Fridays." Tell you what, Mij... you don't bite me, and I won't eat you on Friday. Hello. Colin? He's about, yes. He was just nosing around. As a matter of fact, right now, he's having a cup of tea. He's very quiet and peace-loving. As a matter of fact... he's just rummaging around the wastepaper basket... and inspecting the furniture. He's having a look at my desk and the table lamp! Did you hear something? I think it was the people upstairs. Hang on a moment. I think there's somebody at the window... uh, door. Mij! Hello? Hello, Colin? Yes. I'm afraid we were cut off for a moment. Well, as a matter of fact, I'm just, uh... tidying my shirt drawer. Yes. Uh, look, Colin, I think I'd better go now. He's asking for a drink. Yes. Mij. Steady, Mij. Mij, how could you? They were friends of mine. That first night, I learned something... I would never be allowed to forget. Water to an otter is as vital as air to a bird. But water must be kept on the move and made to do things. It must be extended and spread about the place. A bowl must be at once overturned... or if it were not overturned, must be sat in... and splashed until it overflows. Oh, Mij. You're wet. Get off! Come here. Lie down. That's not funny, Mij. What... - Colin! - What-ho? Oh, come in, Colin. Bit of drama. Yes, I see. I'd give you a hand... but I'm afraid I'm useless at this sort of thing. Yes, I know. Mind the bucket. Yes. Aha. Well, you've made one or two changes, I see. Is it to keep otters in and humans out... or the other way around? It depends. Come in. Any charge for admission? Where is he, by the way? Mij? In the bedroom having a rest. From the decor? I think it's quite fascinating. Oh, I love your mobiles. Do they work? - Help yourself. - Thanks very much. What's Mij doing in the bedroom anyway? He's in disgrace. He taught himself to turn the bath taps on. Oh, how sweet. How very touching. What about the landlady? She insists I find alternative accommodation. Yes, but that's not so easy. I mean, where would you go? She suggested I move into the local police station. She said their caging was free. - Quite. - Thanks. Sit down. Uh... how? Oh. Oh. Thank you. - Well, cheers. - Cheers. It seems a shame, when you've made so many improvements... but surely he'll have to go, won't he? I mean, you can't keep an otter in London. It's too cruel... To the humans, I mean. You'll simply have to find him a home. I suppose you're right. Well, I've got to do something pretty rapidly. Won't I, Mij, old chap? In that moment, I realized for the first time... how deeply I was involved. I hadn't just bought myself an otter. I'd taken a step... that was to change the whole course of my life. This otter had become a part of me. Here I was, bound, it seemed, forever... to this engaging pest. Listen to this, Mij. "Escape the rat race." "Exclusive old-world cottage, west coast of Scotland." "Ideal retreat for author." "Long lease, a few minor repairs. "Quick sale to right person." No, come off the lamp, Mij. "Box 4881." Escape the ra... ha ha. "Escape the rat race," Mij. "Ideal for writer." It's not the easiest thing in the world... to travel by train with an otter. The regulations say he is a wild animal... and must travel in a box, but the regulations... don't know the first thing about otters and boxes. I felt that Mij now trusted me completely... and I wasn't going to betray his trust... by putting him in anything. I thought I'd try to bend the law instead. Single, Inverness, first-class sleeper, and a dog ticket. That'll be Â£12 exactly. Breed? Hmm? What was that? What kind of dog is it? Yes, what kind of dog? Um... a diving terrier. Diving? D-I-V-I-N-G... T-E-R-R-I-E-R. Come on, Mij. Did he say diving terrier? D-I-V-I-N-G... T-E-R-R-I-E-R. Uh, just a minute. Sorry about this, old chap. Just stay there. Uh, come in. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - Can I check your ticket, sir? - Ah, yes. So, you're travelling alone, sir? In that case, I'd better lock off. - Tea in the morning, sir? - Yes, thank you. - 7:00? - Yes. That would be just fine. - Shall I put your luggage up? - No. No, thanks. Is that ventilator working? Well, it is if you turn it on, sir. First sitting dinner, 7:30, sir. Thank you. OK, Mij, you can come out now. Mij? Mij? Sorry. Thought it was my otter. A rat! Eww! Don't make a noise. You'll frighten... What is going on? All right, who's responsible for this? Don't worry, Mij. Never did like travelling by train. Come on. Look, Mij. Travel by bus. And there's one due in... six hours. Come on, Mij. Come on. Ah. Steady, Mij. Which way to the village? You just follow the road over that hill. I wouldn't go there. Oh? Why not? Well, the cottage you want... is a few miles in the other direction... just a wee walk from here. But how will I know when I'm there? Ah, you can't make a mistake. You understand, there's this cottage... and after that, there's the sea. Come on, Mij. Don't worry, Mij, it's just a wee walk. Come on. Why couldn't I pick a horse for a friend? Sorry, Mij. Listen, you go and let off steam. I don't need to. This way, Mij. "Exclusive old-world cottage..." "ideal retreat for writer." "A few minor repairs." "Quick sale to right buyer." Hmm. But to me at that moment in my life... it was the most beautiful place in the world... the place I knew I wanted to be. Go to sleep, Mij. It's only the hunting bats. Go to sleep. There's nothing like... an early-morning cold bathe in the burn... for an otter. I realized it was that burn and the sea... that gave Camusfearna its essential character. A silvery, reflecting circle that rings the green fields... and makes Camusfearna almost an island. Come on, Mij. I'm daydreaming. Got to get ourselves organized. Mij. Come on. Sorry, Mij. I'm only going to the village. You can come next time when I see what it's like. You're making it very difficult, Mij. You're wasting your time. Does he not open today? That depends. Depends on what? On how the fish are biting in the burn. I see. What was it you were wanting? Methylated spirits. Oh, just you try the doctor's. The doctor's? Aye. The first house 'round the corner. They'll maybe have a drop to spare. Thanks. Through that door. The doctor's in. Sit down, please. I was told the doctor was in. Yes. You? I see. I thought... Yes? I thought perhaps you were the doctor's daughter. I am. My father died eight years ago now... and when I qualified, I decided to continue his practice. - Did you know him? - No. Well, I won't take up your time with quite a trifling. Look, please sit down and tell me what the trouble is. - Name? - Merrill. Double "I"? - Double "I." - Age? - Thirty-nine. - Thirty-nine? - Forty. - Where do you live? London... That is, till two days ago. - Holiday? - Not exactly. I'm here for, uh, personal reasons. Where does it hurt? Well, I... Pain... lumbar region. Yes, that's it. I think I must have wrenched my back. I see. Have you ever done this before? No. Never. Take off your coat. Can you touch your toes, please? Yes. Easily. Straight knees. - Is it difficult? - It's always difficult. Will you lie down, please? I'm afraid my hands are rather cold. - Painful? - Uh, yes, uh, very. Hmm. Put your coat on. I'm afraid you pulled a muscle. The best thing is rest on a firm bed. Boards are best. Well, I think that's not too difficult to arrange. Take two of these every four hours to relieve the pain. Come and see me in a few days' time. Thanks. I'd like to do that. There. Oh, there's, uh, just one thing before I go. I wonder if you could let me have... a little methylated spirits? For my stove. Janet? You're sure it's for your stove? Yes, of course it is. Oh, Janet, on his way out... would you give Mr. Merrill a little methylated spirit? For his stove. Good-bye, Mr. Merrill. Nothing strenuous, mind. No, no. Of course not. Those were tame swans on the loch this morning? No. Why? They could have broken your arm. I know, but the cygnet was caught in the wire, you see. I see. You're supposed to be helping, Mij. Now, stop messing about. I've always had the highest regard... for beachcombing as a way of life. Now I found myself... considering every piece of flotsam and jetsam... wondering how I could use it. I soon discovered that something to sit on... would present no problems. What... what... what... what? This, Mij, is what is known as otter-proof whitewashing. No, you don't. Mij! What... what... what... what? That, Mij, is what is known as otter-safe roof repairing. Mij! What... what... what... what? What an idiot I am. If we didn't always agree on the whats and the wherefores... we made up for it afterwards on the beach... which lay over the hill on the north side. In heaven's name, what have you there? Sea monster washed up by the tide. Sea monster. So that's what the tracks were. What on earth were you doing? Playing noses and toeses. It's an old otter game. I see. He's a tame otter. Well, I gathered that. Who lives here with me. Here in this beautiful cove? You sound disappointed. I am. I don't mind the otter, but... Thanks. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude. It's just that I never thought of anyone living here. It's always been so perfect the way it was. I'll try not to change anything. - Doctor... - Mary. Graham. But of course you know that. Mij, come and meet Mary. - Does he bite? - Sometimes. But somehow I don't think he'll bite you. He'd better not. Come. Ah. What's he called? Mij, after an Arab sheik. Well, he's very beautiful in spite of his name. It's just as well I didn't bring Johnny. - Who's Johnny? - My dog. I've always heard that dogs and otters are deadly enemies. Yes, but Mij doesn't know he's an otter. How funny. Johnny doesn't know he's a dog. Well, I'll not keep you from your game. In any case, I must get back to the surgery. - You'll come again? - Perhaps. - And bring Johnny. - I'll see. By the way, how's your back? How do you mean? Oh, my back. Yes. The meths cured it. Good-bye, Mij. Don't worry, Mij. She's not my type. I don't mind wild goose for dinner at all... but not in summertime... when the water birds raise their young. Mij... They were gray-lag geese... the wild variety of the Scottish seashore. It was their mother... that had been killed by the poacher's shot. Hungry and afraid, they were driven by instinct... to follow anything that faintly resembled a grown goose... even an otter. It was very clear... Whatever our feelings were... like it or not, our family had just grown by four. Those few minor repairs took more than a few weeks. When at last I had my house in order... I sat down to begin the job I had set for myself... To write my book about the marsh Arabs. But there was something wrong. Thinking about it was as far as I got. Now, listen, chaps, if you want to learn to fly... you've got to show a little determination. Come on. Come on. Come on! Are you following? You'll never get airborne that way. You've got to flap your wings at the same time. Now, come on, let's try again. Come on. Into position. Ready for takeoff. Come on. Now, are you ready? You start with a slow, graceful, rhythmic movement... just the way I do it. Now watch and follow me. Slowly, then faster... and faster and faster... and faster and faster... and fas... whoa! Johnny and I seem to be interrupting your ballet lesson. Well, not really. You see, I... There's no need to make excuses. I really came to introduce Johnny to the sea monster. I was, uh, teaching them to fly. You're frightening the dog. Oh. Sorry, Johnny. Come and meet Mij. Are you sure? Johnny's very playful. I'll see if I can find Mij. Johnny, Johnny, you stay. Sit. Sit here. Now, you're going to meet Mij, Johnny. Partly to finish my book. But why write a book about marsh Arabs? Because I lived with them once before I was married. - I see. - And divorced. Oh... Come on, Johnny. You must stay here. Oh, don't worry about Johnny. There are only a lot of old fish boxes inside. Well, he'd better stay here because of Mij. Sit down, Johnny. That's a good boy. Only fish boxes. It's just beautiful. Our first visitor, Mij, old chap. Well, you might see the lady's seated first. He's not very used to visitors, I'm afraid. Still he's been very clever today. He caught us our supper. Us? Yes. Well... I hope it's all right. When we first arrived at Camusfearna... the eels were migrating into the burn... and there was no problem about food for Mij. I simply opened the door in the morning... and he soon caught his own breakfast. But as the summer wore on... the eels stopped coming into the burn... and then one day, they were gone. The run was over. They had come in from the sea... and now they had returned to the sea. There would be no more eels until the following spring. Here you are. Nine and threepence change. And a big, hefty man like that, too. Oh, you're right, Sarah. Uh, and a fourpenny stamp. - Just the one? - Yes, dear. Now, I've nothing against folk fraternizing with animals... but an otter? Oh, there's something very strange about that... if ye ask me. Oh, very strange, indeed. Yes, indeed. And, anyway, he should be doing a job. Aye. Maybe Mr. Merrill has money. Well, if he has, a body would never know. I know. You're right, Sarah. His clothes are no' exactly... I know what you mean, Flora. - Good morning, Jeanie. - Good morning, Mary. Good morning, Dougal. How are you this morning? - Are you better? - Yes, I'm feeling fine. And, in any case, you would never think that a lady doctor... Oh, it's yourself, Mary. Good morning, Sarah. Hello, Flora. Well, now, will that be all, Flora? Um, I'll have a fourpenny stamp. Another fourpenny stamp? Oh, aye, just to be on the safe side. What can I be doing for you, Mary? Graham asked me to send this telegram. It's rather urgent. Oh? Just a minute... Twenty. That's twenty words. That's eight and fourpence... including the address, of course. If you've any mail for the islands... Hughie's flying me out there early tomorrow morning. Nothing serious, I hope. - I hope not. - Oh. - Eight and fourpence. - Thank you. Wait you now. I'll read it over. "Clifford Wilcox, 22 Battersy Park Road..." "London, S.W. 15." "Food situation desperate. Please send large container..." "live eels." "Regards, Graham." That's right, Sarah. Now, don't forget the mail, mind. Oh, no, no. I'll not forget the mail. Live eels? Whatever next? My, these Londoners are awful odd. You mean "Graham." Dover sole, dear? Here we are. One nice Dover sole. I can promise you you'll enjoy it. Pay at the desk, will you? Thanking you. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Can I help you? Yes, have you got any live eels, please? Live? No, sir. No, no. Not this time of year, sir. - Oh, dear. - Tell you what. They might be able to help you over there. - Oh, thanks very much. - Not at all. - Can I help you? - Oh, yes, please. - I'd like some live eels. - Eels? Oh, they're over here. - Thank you. - Siamese cooliei. From Siam? They're very small, aren't they? Um, let's see, now. One large container... I should think I'll need about four or five hundred. - How much are they? - They're seven guineas a pair. - Aren't they fun? - Mmm. Well, thanks very much. Food for Mij became a real problem. I often spent several hours a day catching fish for him... or trying to. There were many basking sharks now... migrating from northern waters. They were completely harmless... feeding on plankton, untoothed... frightening only because of their great size. As I watched, I began to see them in a new light. There in the fin... was a whole year's supply of shark steaks. Did you forget something? Uh, no. That isn't a deep freeze out there, is it? Aye, well, you could call it that, I suppose. Does it work? It did once... just after the war. Whom does it belong to now, Mr. Cameron? Well, now, that's difficult to answer... but if you're interested... you can have it for a few shillings... just for the delivery, of course. Thanks. Any chance of getting it to start? Well, with a wee drop of meth and a lot of persuasion... I'd say you'd a chance in a million. Faster. Faster. Faster! Hold her steady! Use the oars! I thought you said he wasn't dangerous. No. I said he had no teeth. At least, that's what it said in the book. Graham? Graham... Come on. Oh! Let me help you. At last, the shark lay cut up in the freezer. I hadn't dared let Mij out at all during the preparations. I felt quite sure he'd gorge himself to death. Mij! Mij! Food, Mij! Not yet, Mij. Don't disturb Mary. Oh, Mij, there you are. Did you think we were never coming back? I did. Here, Mij, before it gets cold. Poor Mij. He must be starving. A whole year's supply. You know, Mary, I'm almost sorry... to have found such a permanent solution so easily. So easily? I mean, no more fishing for Mij. I'm worried. I won't have any excuse now for not writing my book. Come on, Mij. Here, Mij. Here, Mij. Mij? Mij, come back! Mij! Mij! Mij! Mij! Mij! You were saying, Graham? Oh, yes, but I didn't mean it. Well, you don't need to worry now. But there are nearly 400 shark steaks in that freezer. I mean, everyone likes shark steaks. I hope you do. Mij... After two weeks of boiled shark... baked shark, grilled shark, curried shark... Mij and I were in complete agreement. Basking shark was not fit food for man nor beast. In desperation, I made a trip to the nearest fishing port. To be on the safe side, I bid for a mixed box. Do I hear five bob? Now eight bob. Eight and three there. It's eight and three. Eight bob. Eight and three. Eight bob. Eight and three. Eight and six it is. Eight bob. Nine bob. Nine bob? Nine bob? Eight bob again. Eight bid again. Twelve. Twelve shillings. Over there now. What do you say now on a bit of cod here? On the cod. Man, you've got a bit of everything there. Yes. Just playing safe. Quite a mixed bag. Everything except shark. Why, I could let you have a bit of that. No. No, thanks. No, not really. But there's nothing that can beat a well-grilled shark steak. All right. You can put up your windows now. Mij? Mij! Mij? Johnny. I'm sorry. The whole village seemed to be in the surgery this evening. - Any sign of Mij? - No, not a thing. Coming past the point just now... Johnny kept looking out towards the lighthouse and whining... as if he could sense something I couldn't see. - The island, you mean? - Mm-hmm. I doubt it. It's a long way off... too far for Mij to go. Perhaps we'd better take a look. Rob! Ciamar a tha thu? Mis th'ann, mairi nicchoinnich! O'se, se, mairie nicchoinnich. Chair fhaca mi thu bhe choinn fhada. The feasgar bria ann. Tha... aluin. - So Mr. Merrill. - Thios thioram. Tha sin fior... Anabarrach tioram. Tha cuimhn agam bliadhaa elle gle choltach ris. What is he saying? He says it's a nice day. But what about Mij? Tha sinn lorg dobhran, a chiall sinn. Bha dha an se trath air an la... Air na creagan sin thall. Oh. There were otters here... two. Bha e araid... thainig son aca thugam, suas go mo chas. - Must've been Mij. - Why? Well, he said one almost touched his leg. An sin, shnamh aid air falbh... qu eilean droon. - Oh. - What did he say? They swam off to the island of Droon. What do you want to do, Graham? How do you mean? Go there, of course. Mij! Well, if he tried to get here, he didn't make it. After all, he's never been swimming anywhere before... except the burn or bathtub. Graham, is that just seaweed? Where? There. - It looks like... - Mij. Mij! Mij took some time to recover. He seemed unwilling now to leave Camusfearna... even to stray out of my sight... except for an occasional dip in his pool. I realized I had been drawing only one aspect of Mij... and not the best at that. An otter on land is as graceless as a grounded bird. I needed to sketch him underwater. A little beachcombing would produce, I hoped... what I now could use to further my small artistic ambition. Graham? Oh, uh, Mary, stay there. I'll be right out. What are you making? Oh, uh, nothing, uh... j-just a swimming pool. I've brought you a telegram. It's been waiting... at the post office a few days now... but Sarah Chambers said it's nothing important. Well, thanks. Is it worth reading? I very much doubt it. - Very bad news, indeed. - Oh? - Got to go to London. - When? Before spring. No wonder they sent you a telegram. Come and see Mij. By the way, you're invited to a birthday party on the 21st. - Yours? - No, Mij's. It's a Sunday. Well, I should be able to make it. But how do you know it's on the 21st? First day of his birth sign... Aquarius. Come on, Mij. You'll miss your birthday party. Hope this thing works. Come on, Mij. Swimming pool. Come on, Johnny. Come on. Come on. Get down. That's a good boy. Autumn in the highlands... begins with the first day the waterfowl start to gather. The swans were heading south... and my geese, who had finally learned to use their wings... joined the wild flocks from the Hebrides. The first snow fell at Camusfearna. It lay for weeks... to Mij's delight. You don't understand. It's a business trip. Purely business, old chap. Come out of there, Mij. Look, Mij, it takes a day to get there... and a day to get back of hard travelling by bus and by train. Yes, Mij. By train. I'll only be gone a week. Seven days. It's like a jail sentence. Look, Mij, it's not forever. There'll be Mary and Johnny. You'll need this to take him back to the village. Graham, I hope you have a safe journey... and, well, we'll all miss you. Thanks for looking after Mij. Oh, and in case he tries to follow me. Oh. Well, I'll just slip away while he's... Bye. Bye, Mij. Oh, come on, Johnny. Don't be such a coward. Do something about it. It's lovely in there. Isn't it, Mij? Well... come on, you two. Be late for surgery. Come on. I'll bet the water's cold up there at the falls, doctor. It was, indeed, Angus. Aye, it looks as if you'll get another wetting... before you get back. There's a spot of rain just starting. You'll have to hurry. I felt it myself. Johnny, Mij. Angus! I thought it was just an otter. Thanks, Ewan. What a pleasant surprise. I didn't expect you here. I just thought I'd come and meet the bus. And how's the most beautiful doctor in Scotland? - Fine. - And Mij? Well... You're going to tell me that he's wrecked the surgery... and half frightened Johnny to death. - No, he behaved perfectly. - Good. I brought him a present... His favorite. Slinky. Graham. Well, it's a joke. Mij is dead. Don't move. Don't get up. I've never seen a writer at work before. - Hello, stranger. - Hello. I didn't come before, Graham. - Last week was... - Busy? Yes. Yes, quite. Well, you see I've finally started. Oh, I'm so pleased. How's the book going? Very well. Very well, indeed. At least I've got the title down in black and white... but I think it's the wrong one. I should go back to Arabia to write about Arabs. - Leave Camusfearna? - Yes. Could you? No. But I can't spend the rest of my life being a beachcomber. Why not, if it serves the purpose? Because it's only a way of escaping. I realize that now. Come on, I'll... I'll show you what I mean... if it's still there. That'll never get you to Arabia. It was washed up on the beach about two days ago. How strange. "R.C." Wonder what the flag stands for? Antique. Early fifteenth century, I'd say. Of course. Petrol-driven. Used for transporting pilgrims. - To Mecca? - Certainly not. R.C. Roman Catholics. R.C. Robinson Crusoe's more like it. Now, here's a very delicate object. Oh. Also antique? Monocle for a near-sighted whale. This is a very interesting thing. Skin-diving suit for an miniature octopus... who didn't quite make it. Graham? It can't be. We can watch them from the hill. They're coming to Mij's pool. Why should wild otters come here? Unless... Mary, you remember what the lighthouse keeper said? Rob? But there must be dozens of wild otters 'round here. Yes, but these are Mij's. Well, isn't that the way it ought to be? Wild otters swimming in the burn. Mij?
