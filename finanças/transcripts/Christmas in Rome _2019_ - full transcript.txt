Okay, now this way, you will see the Via De Condotti. It's an ancient Roman thoroughfare that was rebuilt in 1544 and is now one of the most fashionable streets in all of Italy. It's a great place if you have any last minute Christmas shopping to do. Now, this isn't a part of our official tour, but how about some treats? I hope you guys enjoy this, I love this place. Ciao! Ciao, merry Christmas, Angela. Buon Natale. [speaking Italian] For your clients. Grazie. Luca's offering free samples. Try it, they're delicious. Luca and his family started the bakery here, in this location, 400 years ago. And they're still going strong. One of their specialties is the Christmas bigne ball tree. Bigne balls? Chocolate and cream filled pastries. Typically eaten on St. Joseph's day in March but every year, one week before Christmas, Luca makes these amazing trees. Are they gluten free, because I'm allergic? I'll find out. I checked, I swear. He told me they were gluten free. Angela, 200 Euros for the allergy shot. Right, sorry. But she turned out okay. She loved the tour and we were able to share the living history of Rome. Angela, this is the third time I've had to talk to you this month. That can't be right. Well, didn't you sneak a tour into the Da Vinci Museum after hours? Yes, yeah, I did do that. It was the see the ceiling mural, it's beautiful. The group loved it. And the gladiator's sword you lost at the Colosseum? Okay, I only borrowed that sword to show those adorable English kids. They were so cute at the time. How was I supposed to know they were gonna take it home? Our travelers expect the basics, you know? Tomasso, they deserve so much more. I mean, our tour should be more than just the seven selfies of Rome. We should help people appreciate its beauty and its lifestyle and its passion. And I love your passion, truly, but this is a business. And your job is to stick to the script. But... But, that's one part of the job you can't seem to remember, so I... So, I made a decision. And I have to let you go. You, you're firing me? Yeah. At Christmas? [upbeat "Jingle Bells"] Mm, I love this time of year. The season of joy, season of giving. It may be the season of giving, Oliver, but we're not handing out any early Christmas presents. Okay, if you look at paragraph seven-- You know what? Why don't we just forget about paragraph seven? I'm sure you all have a ton of Christmas shopping to do so, I'm just gonna write a number. [suspenseful music] ["Deck the Halls"] Hey, Carmen. Hi, Oliver. [knocking] You wanted to see me? I hear Christmas came early this year, Oliver. Congratulations on closing the deal. Nobody else likes to work during the holidays. That's why it's my favorite time of the year. Well, speaking of which, have you heard of Forlinghetti Ceramics? Sure, high end Italian company, expensive. They make everything from plates to cups to Christmas ornaments. My friends Margaret and Jack Fletcher, - you remember them? - Of course. Well, they're visiting Luigi Forlinghetti in Rome for the holidays. Margaret's heard a littler rumor. Luigi is looking to retire. Are the Fletchers looking to acquire his company? They could, but no. They thought Forlinghetti Ceramics would be a good fit for us. Santa might put a promotion under your tree if you can close this one. I can hop on a plane to Rome tonight. Are you sure? Are spaghetti and meatballs Italian? Actually I don't think the Italians put meatballs on their spaghetti. Yeah, of course they don't, I was testing you. [upbeat music] Excuse me, do you speak English, I'm looking for-- [woman speaking Italian] Exuse-a me. Oh, ow, oh. [Oliver] Sorry, sorry. Watch where you're going. Are you American? Yes. And you should be careful. You know, texting and walking is illegal in Italy. You're kidding, right? Yes, I'm kidding. But you do have to be careful here. I wouldn't want you to just walk out into the road and get hit by a car because your eyes are glued to your phone. Why would you think that I would just walk into the road? You just walked into me. Actually I think you walked into me. I don't think so. I'm pretty sure you did. You know what, in the spirit of Christmas, I will give you the benefit of the doubt. Have a wonderful day. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. I apologize. And I know that I don't deserve your help. In the spirit of Christmas, I don't have time to check in before my meeting, could you just tell me where Trattoria Rosselinni is. Oh, it's a great restaurant. Yes, go down here at the end of Panico, you're gonna look for the piazza with the fountain, you make a left, and the immediately make a right, but if you... You know what? It's gonna take me longer to explain how to find it. I'll just show you myself. - Thank you. - Come on. Thank you so much for this. I'm Oliver, by the way. Angela, nice to meet you. So, are you here on business? That's right. - It's December 20th. - So? So, it's only five days until Christmas. Christmas is the best time to get things done. Oh, no, not in Italy. I hope you have time to at least see the city. My schedule's pretty tight. Rome is the most beautiful place on Earth, especially at Christmas. This way. Wow, you really know your way around. I live here, I'm a tour guide. It's my sworn duty to help lost travelers. Well, I appreciate it. I hope I'm not gonna make you late for work. Ah, no, I'm not working today. Oh, is it your day off? Um, not exactly. I been sort of taking a little time off and I'm actually thinking of starting my own company. Nice. Are you sure we're going the right way because my phone says we're supposed to be on that street back there. Your phone can't help navigate Rome at Christmas. You need local knowledge for that. Local knowledge, okay. Oh, look at that nativity scene. Oh, Romans take great pride in their [speaking Italian], ...nativity scenes. I can see that. Cool. Yeah, that's carved entirely by hand. Isn't that just incredible? I appreciate the side tour but I really cannot be late for this meeting. You don't ever stop and smell the roses? I don't think roses are in season this time of year. Okay, we'll take a short cut. This way. Excuse. And here we are, Trattoria Rosselinni. Angela, you are a life saver. I hear the restaurant's great so, good luck with your meeting. Oh, you know... Let me give you something for your time. Oh, no, no, no, no. No, really, it's... Think of it as an early Christmas present. Well, that's very kind, but I insist. Have you ever done business here before? No, why? In Italy, when someone gives you a gift, you always accept it. Otherwise they think you're being rude. I am so sorry. I will not try to pay you again. I'm serious. The business protocol is not like the states. There are cultural differences. Cultural differences? Can't be that different, a deal's a deal. Uh, you'd be surprised. Oh, you should know, every meeting in Italy starts with small talk. Family, friends, travel, weather conditions, whatever. Small talk, got it. Thank you. Mr. Oliver Martin from New York? Yes. I think you and I have a meeting, no? Mr. Forlinghetti, it is a pleasure to meet you, sir. The pleasure is mine. - And you are? - Angela de Luca. She is a tour guide. I was just leaving. Please, join us. Oh, no, no, no, no, I... I insist. You can help us with our cultural differences. You know what, I've always wanted to eat here. Come. Must try the gnocchi. [upbeat music] Mr. Forlinghetti, thank you for meeting with me on such short notice. Call me Luigi, please. I'm very glad you could come all this way. Margaret and Jack Fletcher are old friends. And they tell me wonderful things about your company. Oh, thank you. I know you're a very busy man so I'll get right down to it. I understand that you are considering the future of your company. And I think that Fisk Drummond can offer some very attractive terms. We have much time to talk business. Our food is getting cold. Yes, of course, but I-- [clears throat] This is Oliver's first time in Rome. Mm, first time. I envy you because you can see everything with fresh eyes. Yes, of course. Christmas in Rome is very special. Yes, I was just enjoying the Christmas nativity scene. Pre-cepi. Pre-cepi. Ah, si, si, pre-cepi. And how do you plan to spend your time in Rome? Meeting with you or in the hotel room working. That's all? Well, there was some... You are here a week before Christmas and you don't explore the city? [speaking Italian] Oliver, weren't you just telling me how you planned on seeing the Colosseum and the beautiful Christmas lights above the Spanish steps. Um-hmm, I was just telling her that, right. And then there's the Parthenon. Pantheon. Parthenon's in Greece. Pantheon, Pantheon is what I meant. I meant Pantheon. Oliver, the ceramics we make are made with love. This company has been in the family for generations. Whoever will buy my company must understand it is not just about the clay. It is about capturing the spirit of Rome in the clay. Right, absolutely. Come by my factory tomorrow afternoon. We can get to know each other better and you can tell me all you've seen of Rome. [speaking Italian] Now, let's eat. What just happened back there? I saved your pancetta. It's bacon. Really, because it feels like you volunteered me for a book report on Rome. You have to remember, business is done differently in Italy than in New York. At the end of the day, it's about closing the deal and I'm here to make that happen. Fine, but running in like a bull in a china shop is not gonna impress anybody. How am I a bull in a china shop? You know what, I am just trying to help. For the record, a lot of people like my style. They say I'm a straight shooter. I'm sure they do. All right, listen, merry Christmas and good luck. Ah, hang on. Wait. Can you help me find my hotel? [upbeat music] Well, here we are, Hotel Katrini. Thank you. If you are ever in New York, look me up, I will return the favor. Well, it was very nice to meet you. And I really do hope you enjoy the rest of your trip. Thank you, I appreciate it. Hey, what if I hired you to be my tour guide for the week? What? I'm gonna be here 'til Christmas Eve. Got four days to give me a crash course in Rome. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I don't do crash courses but thank you anyway. You said you were gonna start your own business, right? I'll pay you double your fee. Think of it as a test run. Luigi already loves you and he said he wanted me to get to know Rome. You could help me see all the sights. It's not just about sights, that's not what he meant. But that's what he said. Look, maybe I can help you. I'll do it on one condition. If I give you a tour, you let me do it my way. Your way? What exactly does that mean? I've always wanted to do a real Christmas tour of Rome, something special and meaningful. Sure, whatever, whatever you want to do. What do you say, do we have a deal? All right, deal, great. Okay, first order of business, let's get you checked in. All right. [mellow music] It'll just be a minute. Oliver Martin! Margaret, hi. Hey, Jack. Hey, thank you so much for the introduction to Luigi. Of course, seemed like a good fit. And how are you liking Rome so far? I love it, it's just tough to get around. I would be lost without my guide. Angela, meet Jack and Margaret Fletcher. Merry Christmas. And you, dear. What tour company are you with? Ah... She's starting her own company. Private bespoke tours of Rome for the discerning traveler. A private tour guide. I like the sound of that. What's your company called? I'm still in the formative stages so I don't really have a name yet. I have some ideas, Roaming Rome. No. Or how about Ciao Christmas. Or my personal favorite, Toga Tours. Nope, still working on the name. Well, Oliver, Christmas drinks in the bar at 6:00? I will meet you in there just as soon as I'm checked in. Nice to meet you, Angela. - You as well. - Take care. Um, excuse me, what are you doing? Toga Tours? What I'm doing is helping you with your new company. Yeah, but I didn't ask for your help. But you still need it. You just need a little push. Look, Jack and Margaret Fletcher are serious private investors. If they like the sound of your tour that might be the only investment you need. Okay, but please, just don't tell anyone else about possible plans for a company that I will most definitely not be calling Toga Tours. - Okay, okay, I promise. - Great. Also, don't have too many of those Christmas cocktails. Trust me, they're lethal here. And we are getting an early start to the tour tomorrow. What's early? 10 A.M. 10 A.M.'s early? It is in Italy. [bell dings] [lively instrumental "Deck the Hall So, this is all I could find in your apartment. That's great, thanks Francesca. Just have to finish this before my tour tomorrow. I thought Tomasso fired you. He did. I met an American, he's here on business for a few days and he hired me to give him a private Christmas tour. Why you didn't tell me? Eh, it's a long story. Oh, that's wonderful. You're one of the best tour guides in this city. Grazie. [Francesca] So now we can do the top. [Angela] All right. [upbeat Christmas music] Room with a view. [phone buzzing] - Hello. - Oliver, it's Estelle. - [Oliver] You're up early. - Actually working late. How was your meeting with Luigi? Great, great. You'll be happy to know he's invited me to tour his factory today. Did he accept our offer? Not yet. It's all part of how they do business here. It's a bit of a dance, but, I'm finding my feet. Okay, just try to move quickly before any other companies swoop in. Understood. [Estelle] That's what I like to hear. Okay, first a few tools of the trade. A tour guide has to be prepared for all contingencies. What is that? It's a GPS tracking device. Is that really necessary? The worse thing a tour guide can do is lose a client. Have you lost a client? Once, and it wasn't my fault. There were 15 Irish rugby players, okay? They didn't listen to a work I said. I'm the only person on the tour. Right. And this way, I won't lose you. All right. [speaking Italian] Oh, will this tour also be in English? Very funny. Welcome to Rome. [upbeat music] Just imagine being a gladiator, dropped into this unfamiliar city, you're from a different country, you don't speak the language, you're competitors are out to get you. Hey, I can relate. I gotta admit, this is one amazing feat of engineering. Can you believe that was created in less than 10 years? Now that's productivity. Just curious, do you ever think about anything other than business? Hey, I am taking the time to appreciate my surroundings. For instance, there is a very nice Christmas tree. Yeah, that's the thing about Rome, they know how to celebrate Christmas. What is that? A guidebook I bought at the hotel. It says there are 10 iconic sights to see in Rome and I want to check off all of them today. Oh, can I see that for a second? Yeah, sure. Oh, um-hmm, um-hmm, very interesting, yeah. Why did you do that? That is checklist tourism. My tour shows you the soul of Rome and the spirit of Christmas and that's what Luigi wants you to understand. The soul of Rome? What does that even mean? The beauty, the art, the history and romance, the culture. Sorry, jet lag. You were saying something about the soul of Rome or something? Hey, wait up. How much farther? Almost there. How do you have so much energy? I give walking tours all day. It builds up stamina. Trust me, it will be worth it. That's spectacular. Wow. It's my favorite view of Rome. It's kind of my secret spot. It's not something you will find on a regular tour. Kind of like a local's only thing? Yeah, exactly. I'm sure you've heard that Rome was built on seven hills, well, there's the Palatine Hill, Pantheon, Janiculum, Palace of Justice. [Oliver] That's cool. And St. Peter's Basilica. Gotta admit, this is a great view. Oh, now there is a Christmas present that I could go for. That latte I had at the hotel today had zero kick. Did you order a latte or a caffè latte? I ordered a latte like I do every single day of my life. Yeah, but in New York. Excuse me? You're used to ordering a latte in New York. In Italy, latte means plain milk. Why didn't I know what? That's why you hired me. I know one of the best coffee vendors and they set up right around the corner. Now you're talking, lead the way. Let's go, come on. [upbeat music] Let me get your coffee. Oh please, thank you. [speaking Italian] Why did you hold up three fingers? I got us each an espresso and one more. - For who? - I dunno, that's part of the fun. You lost me there. It's a Christmas tradition here. Caffè sospeso means suspended coffee, buying coffee for someone who can't afford it. So, later on the vendor will offer someone a Christmas coffee as a gift. So, it's like pay it forward. Exactly. Grazie. Prego. Mmm, now that hits the spot, wow. It's nice. It's not bad. It would be perfect if I could bet better cell service. Do you ever think about anything except work? I'm working on it. Let's sit. You don't miss being at home for Christmas? Not at all. Christmas is the best time to get things done. Everybody else wants to have time off, it gives me an edge. Oh, so you're a workaholic? It's in my blood, I guess. My father was running a Fortune 500 company when he was my age. Wow, those are some pretty big shoes to fill. Yeah, tell me about it. What about you? You like being a tour guide? Oh, I love being a tour guide. But, starting a company up on my own is... It's intimidating. Don't worry about it, you're a natural. Well, that's easier for you to say. You're a business guy. - What do you need? - Need for what? To make your tour company work, what do you need? Oh, well. First I need to get investors. And to do that, I need to write a business plan which I have no idea how to do. - I can help you with that. - Really? I work in acquisitions and business development. I could write a business plan in my sleep. And you would do that for me? If, you help me close the deal with Luigi. Done. [laughing] Okay, so, what do you think Luigi wants? What any other business owner wants, to sell his company for the highest number. I dunno. Luigi's family is very old, very traditional and very rich. I don't think money is the only motivating factor here. Okay, so what is? I think he wants to know that his company is in good hands. Hmm. I think he wants to know that whoever he sells his company to is gonna value the things that are important to him. - [bell ringing] - [p[gentle music]ng] Hey Italian Santa. Actually they call him Babbo Natale. You know, if you have any Christmas gifts you need to buy for anybody special back home this is the place. This is nice. Oh, yeah, that's antique bronze from Verona. It's beautiful. Bel-isima. But, I don't really need anything because I already sent my folks on a Christmas cruise - to the Caribbean. - Aw, that was nice. Don't have anyone else to shop for? Naw, that's pretty much it. You know what? You could buy something for Luigi's grandkids. It's customary to buy gifts when you're doing business with someone new. That's a good idea. Yeah. [gentle music] My great-grandfather moved the workshops here a century ago. Before that, we were in a village in Sicily. And, ah... [speaking Italian] He's saying, "the old kiln was actually built into the village's medieval walls." It's certainly not like any factory I've ever seen. All of our workers are artists, artists of clay, paint, glass. And we give them all the time they need to make their wonders. Doesn't that limit their production capacity? Perhaps, but art cannot be rushed. And everything is just beautiful. Come, I show you my favorite room of all. These are the finest Christmas ornaments in the world. My grandfather used to make them for the family Christmas. Then my mother carried on the tradition, then me and my children too. This is where a delicate hand brings to life... [speaking Italian] "The joys of Christmas." Yes, the joys of Christmas. I don't imagine these command the same margin as kitchen ceramics in your store given how long they must take to create. Yes, a lot of time. Each one hand painted. But the result, it speaks for itself. Bell-issimo. Beautiful. So, have you been enjoying your time in Rome? Yes, yes, actually Angela's been giving me a tour of the city. - It's beautiful huh? - Amazing. We climbed up to some secret local's only view point so we could see the seven hills of Rome. All seven? And which one did you like best? I liked looking at Gian-jello. [laughing] You mean Janiculum. Well, actually Janiculum doesn't belong to the seven hills of Rome, but it's beautiful. And how it make you feel? Exhausted, when we bought that caffè sospeso, I was the one that needed it the most. You know caffè sospeso? Sure, the Christmas tradition of buying someone else's coffee. That's one of my favorite traditions. Which reminds me, some gifts for your grandchildren. Angela took me to this great Christmas market. Thank you, very kind. Tomorrow is December 22nd, you must both join me for dinner at my family villa. And there, perhaps, we can talk business too. That would be great. - Ciao. - Ciao. [upbeat music] And this is St. Peter's Basilica, the burial place of St. Peter. Impressive. You know, I should really be getting back to the hotel. You want to impress Luigi, you have to do your homework. St. Peter's is regarded as one of the holiest Catholic shrines. Now here you can see... Angela? Tomasso, hi. What are you doing here? You have a big group today. Oh, yeah, business is good and you have a tour of one? Oliver Martin. Tomasso Toffino. If you want a real American style tour, please call me. Real American style tour, what's that? Well, we cover Rome's top 10 tourist sites in a single day. All 10, that's quick. Well, we keep to a schedule. I like that, but I signed up with Angela's company because I was looking for something a Angela's company? Oh yeah, didn't she tell you? It's a boutique personalized travel service. No, I didn't know that you had started your own company, Angela. Oh yeah, she's fantastic. She's gonna be handling all of our corporate tours here next year. Yeah. Oh, that's, well that's great news. Congratulations. Oh, thank you so much, Tomasso. You know we should probably move on. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you, and have fun, thank you. [Oliver] That guy back there a friend of yours? My ex-boss. He actually fired me. Wait, boutique personalized travel service. - I'm sorry. - No don't be, I liked it. Thank you for making me sound good. I figured I owed you for saving my bacon yesterday with Luigi. You know what, it's three o'clock, so I think that concludes our tour for the day. Do you want me to walk you back to your hotel? I was hoping we could find somewhere to eat. I dunno, that's gonna put me into overtime. I don't want to eat with you as my tour guide. I just want us to eat together. Are you asking me out on a date? No, no, no, not a "date" date. Good, because I'm not allowed to date my clients. Hang on, aren't you starting your own company? Doesn't that mean you get to make the rules? And those are my rules. Got it. For the record, I was not asking you out on date. - Good to know. - 'Cause that would be awkward. No, and that's why there are rules, you know, so. But, we both still need to eat, right? So, why don't we eat together? I really shouldn't. I'm actually gonna go get a Christmas tree for my apartment. Really? Oh, I happen to be an expert in the Christmas tree department. You are not. Oh try me. We will get you the best tree on that lot. You got your Douglas Fir, your Frazier Fir, your Grand Fir, and my personal favorite, the Noble Fir, known for its strong branches and smell. Here, it's the Austrian Pine. When I'm looking for a Christmas tree, I like to go for height. Really? Nah, there's so many other things to consider. Okay, well, this one has a good height, a nice color and scent. It's kind of sappy. This one, it just looks great, right? It's perfecto. Ah, how do you say please? - [Angela] Per favore. - Per favore. Please. I think it's gonna look really good over here. Just right over here. Here, I'll go look. Let me look. Perfecto, perfect. Zia Angela, Zia Angela. Hi. Have you made gingerbread houses? Oh, I love gingerbread houses. Z-Angela? Zia means auntie. This is Monica, she lives downstairs. She is my favorite neighbor. - Hello, I'm Oliver. - Buon Natale. Buon Natale. Ciao! Ciao, Angela. Ciao, Francesca Gianelli. Oliver Martin. Oh, you bought a tree. And I'm Pietro. Merry Christmas, Oliver. - Merry Christmas. - Do you need a hand? Yes, please. You have known Angela a long time? Actually we just met. I'm in town this week for business, hoping to acquire a ceramics company. Forlinghetti. Wow, Forlinghetti? Beautiful. I think so. Now, come. Monica needs help building ginger bread houses, right? Let's go, come on. ["The First Noel" piano instrumental] Here is some hot chocolate for you guys. Gra-sie. Prego. It's grazie. Grazie. Hey, I just a great idea. Why don't we switch? [laughing] No? He's very funny. Oliver. That's definitely one word to describe him. And good looking too, huh? I hadn't noticed. Of course not. I have more building material. Just in time, thank you. Oh, wow, that is, um, certainly different than any gingerbread house I've ever seen before. That is because it's not a gingerbread house, it is a gingerbread Colosseum. Oh, very artistic. Yeah, see this is the outer wall. Nice, oh. And it's the fall of Rome. I think you're gonna need more icing. - Yes. - I'll get it. [bright music] I mean, I was really impressed with your Colosseum. I know. You didn't have to walk me all the way back. No, I actually think I did. Can't lose anyone on the tour, remember? I had a great time. And I can honestly say I've never been on a tour anything like yours. I think you have a real opportunity here. Thank you. Now if you could just find a way to scale your business, hire more tour guides so you can work as CEO and brain trust, then you got something that investors can really get behind. This is exactly what I've been thinking. I'm happy to help anyway I can. Um, that's really sweet. I have my moments. And I appreciate it. Um, I think we should focus on tomorrow though. Okay. So, we're going to Luigi's villa for dinner. And, I think we need to do Rome like the Romans. Do Rome like the Romans. What does that mean? In Italy, when someone invites you to dinner you bring a gift. So, I need to buy something for Luigi. Not buy, bake. Bake? I don't bake. Well, you will tomorrow. Have a good night. Good night. [gentle music] Bake. [phone beeping] [gentle music] Good morning. Ah, buongiorno. Thank you so much for emailing the business plan template. You didn't have to do that. Oh yes, I did. A deal's a deal. Plus, I wanted to. Thank you. Did you get it finished? Ah, no. I just got started, but, I do have a name. Let's hear it. When in Roma. When in Roma, do as the Romans do. Exactly. Catchy, simple, clear, I love it. Thank you. All right, are you read to see Rome like Roman? Ready as I'll ever be. Wait, no, no, hold on. - Put this on. - I, ah, can't ride a motorbike. It's not a motorbike, it's a Vespa. Don't worry, I'll do the driving. [upbeat music] [horn honking] [upbeat music] You okay? I think I nearly died about 50 times. Nobody pays any attention to the road signs. No. And nobody signals. No never. Signaling in Rome is seen as a sign of weakness. Amazing anyone survives. And yet, we do. All right, I'm gonna need you to close your eyes. I don't really like the-- No, come on, just trust me. Rome isn't just a city of old buildings. It's a city of sensations, especially at Christmas. All right, this way. Now you're gonna take a step up, step up. Ha! - You okay? - Okay, yeah, yeah. All right, where do you think we are? Without looking? Yeah, that's the point. Take a deep breath, breathe in that scent. A cupcake factory. Angela! [speaking Italian] Okay, keep your eyes closed but open your mouth. Ahh. What do you think? Delicious. Really? Mm, what is it? Mm, ciao. Ciao. It's panettone. Luca makes the best in the city. It's a sweet bread load with dried fruit. It's one of my favorite Italian Christmas traditions. So, it's pretty much just Christmas fruitcake, - Italian style? - Yeah, pretty much. It's amazing. Come, I have it all set up for you, okay? Follow me. [bright music] Come, come this way, guys. I prepared all the ingredients you need. Ingredients for what? For panettone. I can't even boil an egg, let alone bake Christmas bread. That's why you're here, to learn. Enjoy. [speaking Italian] Ciao. Okay. Panettone is the king of Christmas breads. An The stale store-bought kind that you find in America. Real panettone, it's rich and buttery. Okay, it sounds good so far. So, now the dough is easy to make. Just watch me and follow along. Take the oil. And then the salt. And then we'll add the flour. Slowly, add the flour. You know what, your method works too. All right, now for the fun part. - Dig in. - All right. Yes. Perfect. Hey, it's working. All right, now we're just gonna throw a little flour on our boards and then you're gonna take the dough and you're gonna knead it until it becomes smooth and elastic. So, how come you're in Rome? I mean, don't get me wrong, Rome is amazing, but why not Paris or London? Ah, my parents are both from Seattle, but they met here, a semester aboard in college. And then they brought me here one summer when I was 10 and I just, ah! I just thought Rome was so magical. Your folks still live in Seattle? Ah, no, they both passed away a while ago. I am so sorry. Thanks. Is that why you left? No, I loved Seattle. I loved it, I had my whole life planned there. Fine, I'll tell you the story. Ah, five years ago I was planning the perfect Christmas wedding. I mean everything was perfect, perfect venue, perfect food, perfect church, and all just perfect until my perfect fiancé, Brian, well, he got perfectly cold feet. He left you at the altar? A week before, but yeah. Threw me for a loop. I imagine it did. So, I just packed up everything I owned and I left. I fell in love with this place, its beauty, and you know, the history. So, I got a great job at a tour company, a job which I have not lost, as you know. Angela, I truly believe that you can do whatever you set your mind to. Starting your own tour company should be a piece of cake. - Pun intended. - [laughing] Thank you. I on the other hand have created a boulder, a rock type dough scenario. You have, yes. I do not have what it takes to figure this out. Let me help you. All right, you have to knead it. You can't be afraid to really push it around. Yeah, look. It's working. Perfect. All right, now we're gonna add the dried fruit, the raisins and the nuts. [phone buzzing] Oh, um... It's my boss. - Do you mind? - Oh no, of course. This has to rest before we put it in the oven anyway. Hey, Estelle, I got your email last night. I was just gonna call you back. I wanted to make sure things were moving ahead. Things are moving a bit slower than I expected but Luigi did invite me to his family's villa tonight and in Italy, that's a big step. Well, that's good news, but it could also be a stalling tactic. I don't think anybody's stalling. Where are you? I am in a bakery. And what's that got to do with winning the Forlinghetti deal? Estelle, I'm in Italy. They got a different way of doing business around here. [Estelle] Now you're making me nervous. When was the last time I let a big deal like this get away, hmm? I got everything under control. Now, the last thing I want to show you is the world famous Trevi Fountain. Spectacular, wow. [speaking Italian] This is incredible. [people laughing] What are they doing, making Christmas wishes? Aw, no, it's an old tradition. They say if you throw coins with your right hand over your left shoulder into the fountain, a return to Rome is guaranteed. Okay, here we go. Oh, wait, wait. Too late, what did I do? How many coins did you throw in? Three I think, why? - Oh, oh no. - What's wrong? Oh no. Well, one coin gets you a return to Rome. Two coins brings you an Italian romance. But three coins, well, three coins brings you true love. Well, don't worry, I don't believe in fairy tales so... Me neither. But my parents threw three coins in, and well, it worked its magic for them. [gentle music] It's a beautiful picture. That was Christmas Eve almost 40 years ago. The day before they got married. Thanks. We should probably get going, get ready for tonight. Okay. [gentle music] [speaking Italian] What a beautiful dress. Grazie. You look incredible. I figured since we're going to dinner at Luigi's home and this is your big business deal, I should put in a little bit of effort. I appreciate it. We should go, the taxi's waiting. Right. [gentle music] [people chattering] Thank you. I cannot believe you made us panettone, Oliver. Two panettone. Due. And for you, we break the tradition. We eat it before dinner. Thank you. Angela took me to this beautiful bakery. It's Il Forno. Oh, Il Forno, I know it, very good. Yes, we made them together. From scratch? I just followed Angela's lead and did what she told me. It's a beautiful gesture, grazie. Prego. And now he speaks Italian. You'll be fluent in no time. [motor humming] [Sofia] This is one of my favorite. It's incredible, they're all so unique. These ornaments are just... They're beautiful. Some of these ornaments were made by Luigi's parents or grandparents, and by our children. So, when we look at the tree, it's not just beautiful, each ornament is a moment in time. Oh, that is a lot of special Christmas moments. Exacta-mente. Oh, excuse, I must check on dinner. Oh, of course. It's incredible. It's a Christmas treasure. Gives new meaning to family tree. [Angela] So, how it's going with Luigi? I'm not gonna rush him. We'll see. What? Look at you, you're learning to slow down, live life like an Italian. Maybe I am. I gotta admit it, this trip is not quite what I expected it to be. In a good way, I hope. Better than good. What's that for? [chuckles] To help me remember this perfect night. Send me a copy. Of course. Angela, Oliver, come, exactly five minutes. We'll be right in, Sofia. The panettone was such a great idea. Just one more thing that makes Angela's tours unique. Her tours do sound amazing. She's actually looking to expand her company, hire some more guides. Good for you. Thank you, I'm still in the beginning stages of planning. I've taken a look at her business plan, pretty impressive. Well, Oliver's always had a good nose for business. So if he says it's good, it must be. Maybe we could have a look. We do like to invest in small businesses. Great, I could bring the business plan by your hotel tomorrow if you like. Perfect. Well, I think we should have a toast. I've only been in Rome for a couple days but Luigi and Sofia, you have made me feel so welcome and I just want to thank you for your generosity and your hospitality. So, to one and all, Merry Christmas. [everyone] Merry Christmas. [speaking Italian] [car motor rumbling] [Jack] And here we are at home away from home. It was such a treat, spending the evening with you. Likewise. What a meal! Luigi needs to go into the restaurant business. [laughing] I think I'm gonna walk Angela home. Good night. Good night, Jack. I can't believe you told them I was looking for investors to grow my company. Think of it as an early Christmas gift. Thank you. You wanna go get some hot chocolate? I'd love to, but I feel like I should go home and work on my new business plan. I could help you. I think I've got it covered. Because with investors like this, you only get one shot. You really gotta make sure you're ready. Oh, I've already been working on it, I just need to polish it up. Okay. Can I still walk you home? I'd love that. [gentle music] [keyboard clicking] [phone jingling] Oliver, hi. How's the business plan going? It's getting there. I just emailed you a couple of photos from last night. You might want to use those too. Okay. Oh, here it is. Oh, these are great. So, I'm gonna be busy the rest of the day with Luigi. Oh, right, good luck. And you've got some pitching to do, so good luck to us both. I was thinking maybe you should take the next 24 hours off. Oh, okay. Is something wrong? No, no, I'm just trying to work around a problem. What kind of problem? You have a rule against dating clients, right? Yes. So, in theory, if I wasn't your client, you could go to dinner with me tonight? In theory, um-hmm. Excellent. Would you like to go to dinner with me tonight? I would love that. Great. I will make a reservation and pick you up a 7:00. That sounds great. Wait, no, I'm the tour guide. I should be making the itinerary. Not tonight. My cab's here, I gotta go. Good luck. Okay, good luck, I'll see you later. [bright, happy music] Luigi, thank you for letting me use this studio, I really appreciate it. It's a pleasure to help. I understand that you want to make a very special Christmas gift? Angela was so helpful to me this week. I noticed. Helpful and quite lovely. She really loved the ornaments. I wanted to give her something very special for Christmas. You're very talented. I took a few art classes in college. Maybe there were some aspirations. Perhaps Rome has reawakened them. Not only Rome, Oliver. Where there is passion, there is art. [phone jingling] Pronto. [Tomasso] Ciao, Angela. Tomasso, hi. I didn't expect to hear from you again. Can I take you for a coffee? I'm sorry, I'm actually really busy right now. Well, I was wondering if, do you want to come back to work? - You fired me. - I let you go. Isn't that the same thing? All right, I made a mistake and I apologize, Angela. Please, come back. I'm sorry, Tomasso, but no. Look, some of our online reviews mention you by name. And the new customers are asking for you. I'm actually doing my own thing now. I have a business plan and I'm meeting with investors today. Ah. [gentle music] My tour isn't for people who want to just take the top 10 selfies of Rome. I want to give people a true Roman Christmas experience. I want to show them the hidden corners, explain the legends, taste the flavors. But just Christmas tours? No, not all. I do want the tours to be seasonal and specific to what the clients want. Think of a custom made tour designed specifically for what you want. Just imagine experiencing Rome through the eyes of a real Roman. I know the best guides in the city and I can get them to work for me. How ya gonna do that? By building in an attractive bonus package based on sales. The tour company does well, so do they. I've got 10 guides already lined up and more calling every day. I have a web designer and an online marketing team literally living in my building. I'm ready for this. I just need the seed money. Looks good. We'll think about it. Thank you. [gentle music] I brought you a coffee. Thank you, Luigi. I'm almost done. It's beautiful. You know, I realize that these Christmas ornaments are only a small part of your product line but whoever buys your company if they expand production, I bet they could find a big audience for these in America. I appreciate your advice. And you are probably right. But I have to let you know that I've made a decision about the future of my company. And? I told you that I wanted to sell my company to somebody who understands not just the business but also the heart and the soul of what we're trying to do. Somebody who understands the soul of Rome. Well, I'm grateful that you gave us the opportunity to bid for your company. You and your family have built something very special here and, I only hope that whoever the new owner is, that they appreciate that. The company I chose is yours. Seriously? Yes, congratulations. Luigi, thank you for your trust. You won't regret it, I promise. Thank you for lending me the dress. You look so beautiful. Thanks, I'm kind of nervous. That's a good sign. It means you're excited about your date. Oh, I don't know if we're calling it a date. I mean I don't think it's like a "date" date. Is it a date? It's totally a date. But he's going back to New York. New York is not that far. And people make long distance relationships work all the time. I don't know anyone who has. Well, you have haven't been out on a decent date in forever. Oh, well, thanks. It's about time you got out there. [speaking Italian] You look beautiful, let's go. [gate squeaks] What is all this? A celebration. Did you close the deal? No work talk 'til after dinner. I don't know if I can wait that long. Well, then we better hurry. Where did you find a horse and carriage? You may be the best tour guide in Rome but you're not the only tour guide in Rome. [laughing] There we go. My parents loved this city, so living here it really makes me feel close to them. You are really lucky. Honestly, most of the time, I have no idea where I live. You're looking at a guy who's on the road 200 days out of the year. Have you ever thought about just settling down some place you love? Sure, someday. Someday, it's a dangerous word. Well, now that dinner's done, how did it go with the Fletchers? You know, I think it went well. They have a copy of the business proposal and they're gonna think about it. That's great. I wanted to say though, that whatever happens, this was a big step forward for me to do my first official business pitch and I really have you to thank for that. And I have you to thank for something. As of this afternoon, Fisk Drummond is acquiring Forlinghetti Ceramics. We did it, we convinced Luigi. Oliver, that is incredible. That's... Wow, you did it. No, no, no, no. We did it, Angela, and I couldn't have What you taught me about Rome, about baking, about life. That's what convinced Luigi. I'm really happy for you. I, um, got you a gift. Early Christmas present. This is so nice. Oliver, this is so beautiful. This is... It's from Luigi's studio, right? But, I don't remember seeing this one. That's because I made it for you. You made this? Yeah, those are all the places you showed me. It's beautiful, thank you. Really, wow. Okay, well, the funny thing is, I got you a Christmas present too. Wow. It's the picture frame from the market. Antique bronze from Verona. Very good. And the picture makes it perfect. Just wanted you to have something to remember me by. Well, I won't need any help to remember you. But thank you, I love it. [phone buzzing] It's my boss. No, you can take it, really, I don't mind. I don't want to. There is nowhere else in the world that I would rather be right now than right here with you. I feel the same way. I can't believe it's Christmas Eve tomorrow. You're going back to New York, right? Well, that was the plan, but I've been thinking, I don't have to go back right away. Maybe I stick around for a couple more days, at least through New Year's. We could spend Christmas together. Spending Christmas with you would be the greatest gift of all. Oliver, I really, really, really like you. And these last few days have been absolutely amazing. But, how could we make this work? This? Yeah, this, this whatever it is we have together. Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think you're the most amazing woman I've ever met and I don't want to let you go. And I feel the same, but, we hardly know each other. That's not true. I know it's only been a couple of days, but I already feel like I know you better than people I've known my whole life. I want to give this a chance. Me too. Oh, I love this song. Want to dance? Um, yes. But no, no, no, no, no, not in front of all these people. It's easy, just follow my lead. No, I really don't know how to dance, I'm not a dancer. Miss Angela de Luca, may I have the pleasure of this dance? You may. [upbeat jazz version of "The First Noel"] ♪ They looked, they looked up and saw a star ♪ ♪ Shining in the east beyond them far ♪ ♪ And to the earth, it gave great light ♪ ♪ And so it continued both day and night ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ The First Noel [phone buzzing] I am so sorry. It's okay, just answer it. I'll be quick, I promise. Okay. Hi, Estelle. [Estelle] Oliver, I got your email. - Well done. - Thank you. Now we need to get you home, ASAP. We've got meetings on the 26th. The day after Christmas? I was thinking I'd be spending a couple more days here, at least through the New Year. No, that's out of the question because for you, the new year means a new office and a new job title. [melancholy music] Hey. [Oliver clears throat] Are you okay, is something wrong? I have some news. My boss offered me the VP position. Congratulations, that's amazing. Yep. But they need me to fly back tomorrow. Wait, tomorrow. You just said you were staying a few more days. I know. It's Christmas Eve tomorrow, I mean you can't work on Christmas Day. They want me to huddle with the lawyers the day after Christmas so I can hit the ground running in the new year. But, you said no, right? Not exactly. I am so, sorry, Angela, but I really do need to go back to New York. Oliver, how could we possibly make this work between us if you can't even stay for Christmas? We'll figure out a way. It's just one holiday. Yeah, but it's Christmas, it's not just a holiday. You said it yourself, you were gonna work through Christmas and I was hoping that would change, but... I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. I meant what I said. These last few days have been amazing and Rome is a magical place and I think we both got caught up in the fantasy that we could make it work. And I meant what I said. I do feel like I know you. You're an amazing person and I want to see where this goes. Yeah, but Oliver, that's not realistic. I mean, we live 5,000 miles apart. You have your life, I have mine. So what are you saying? I'm saying I wish we lived in the same city. I wish we lived in the same country, but, we don't, Oliver, and that's not gonna change anytime soon. The truth is, I don't want a long distance relationship. I don't see how we have any other choice. Sure we do. We can be grateful for the time that we had together and we can be friends. Friends? Um... I have to get up early in the morning, so ah, I'm gonna say good night. Merry Christmas, Oliver. Angela. [mellow music] [trunk slams] [melancholy music] [phone ringing] [Oliver] Hi, Angela, it's Oliver. Would you call me back, please? I really need to talk to you. [melancholy music] [phone buzzing] Angela. [Estelle] No, it's not Angela, it's your boss. Sorry, Estelle. You all packed and ready? Yeah, I'm on the red eye, but I gotta meet Luigi at a Christmas caroling concert first. That's fine. But you're meeting with the lawyers the day after Christmas and then the marketing team in LA. Sounds like a busy New Year. You better sleep on that plane 'cause you're gonna hit the ground running when you're back. There's something I want to talk to you about. Oh no! Hey, Estelle, Estelle. Oliver? Oliver. [Fransceca speaking Italian] He's leaving. I thought you two had the [speaks Italian], the thunderbolt for each other. I thought so too, but, well, Oliver's headed back to New York. I let myself get carried away. I mean, I knew he was only here for a few days. Well, you had a difficult year, Angela. There is a new year, right around the corner. Yes, a new year and ah, maybe it's time for some change. What do you mean? A friend of mine called this morning and asked me if I was interested in going back to Seattle for work. And what about your new business here? I don't know how real that is. I don't have any investors yet. And what about Oliver? He made his choice. It wasn't me. I've known you for five years, Angela. And in that time, I've never seen you look at a man the way you look at Oliver. Life is short, Angela. And love, love doesn't come along every day. I never said anything about love. You didn't have to. Francesca, I've barely known him a week and I feel like I've known him my whole life. It was the same for me and Pietro. But not everybody is so luck. Not everybody find someone to love but if you do, you need to take him with both hands and never let him go. I messed up, I feel like I ruined it. No, you made a mistake. And now you can fix it. Call him, call Oliver. - I should call him. - Yes. Okay. Ah, okay. Are there any quick phone repair shops near the hotel? No. Okay, well, thank you very much. - Oliver! - Margaret. Hey, we tried to call you. Phone's dead, dropped it in the sink. We heard about your deal, congrats. And your promotion. Figured you'd be on your way back to New York to open the champagne. Not just yet. I understand that Angela pitched her business plan to you yesterday. She was very impressive. I really like her, Oliver. And I can tell she likes you too. Margaret, stop. Leave the man alone. A woman knows these things. So, you're on your way to the airport? First, I'm meeting Luigi at the Christmas caroling concert in St. Peter's Square. We wanted to see that too, but, shopping took too long and there's not enough time. It starts in less than an hour. And don't you have a plane to catch? I'm gonna try to catch both. Really? Well, see ya back in New York. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. If you really want to go to the Christmas concert, I'm sure we can figure it out. Not with the traffic. Oliver's gonna be late to meet Luigi there. We have no chance. So, how about we drop these off and get us a Christmas cocktail? [suspenseful music] [Margaret and Jack chatting] Margaret, Jack, perfect! Have you seen Oliver? Oh, you just missed him, he left a few minutes ago. I've tried calling, he's not answering. Oh, his phone's dead. Was he headed to the airport? Yeah, no, he's on his way to St. Peter's Square first. - For the concert? - Yes, he's meeting Luigi there. Thank you so much. Oh, you'll never make it with the traffic. That's what Vespas are for. Wait! We wanna come too. We do? Hurry up, Jack. Let's go. [upbeat music] [motors humming] Oh, we'll never find him in this crowd. You know what? I gave him a GPS button on our first day. He's this way. [choir singing "Adeste Fideles"] Excuse. Sorry. Oliver! Oliver! Angela, what are you doing here? How did you find me? You still have your GPS tracking device. I'm so happy you're here. Listen, I know you're on your way to the airport but I really need to talk to you. [choir singing] It's magic. So beautiful. I want to apologize for walking out on you last night. You don't need to apologize. Yes, I do. And I'm sorry for not answering your calls this morning. It's okay, I understand. I know we've only known each other a few days and in some ways, we hardly know each other at all but I feel so connected to you and I don't want to lose that feeling. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose you either. I want to see where this goes and if having a long distance relationship is hard then it's hard. I mean nothing good ever came easy. But I say it's worth it, I want to give this a shot. Well... Angela? You delivered quite the Christmas miracle. The singing was divine, thank you. It was my pleasure. Tell her, honey. We've looked at your business plan and we want to invest with you. That's amazing. Oh my goodness, that is amazing. Thank you so much. Angela, congratulations. I'm so happy for you. I don't want you to leave. I may not have to. Are you going back to New York tonight? Hmm, three coins in the Trevi Fountain said otherwise. Remember, one coin brings you back to Rome, two coins brings you romance, and three coins... Leads you to true love. Angela, I appreciate you trying to make our relationship work long distance but I don't want to be away from you not even for a minute. So, I spoke to Estelle and Luigi and I'll be running Luigi's company from here. [speaking Italian] It might be a little bit of a change of pace for me but I think a change will do me good. But what about being VP? That was your dream job. Yeah, but it was missing one thing. What? You. Um, can I show you something? Sure. Just right over here. And, this is the spot. What spot? The spot from the photo you showed me of your parents standing in St. Peter's Square. The Christmas tree was just to their left so they would have been standing right here. You're right. This is the spot my parents stood in 40 years ago. It's amazing. I think it's a sign. I told you the city's magical. So are you. [soaring music] [upbeat music]
