He's handsome, ain't he? Whoo! - Really, what? - He treat you good, Mama? - Yeah. Better than your father ever did. - You let him rest in peace, all right, Ma? This guy hit you? - No. - This guy hits you, you tell me- - Hit? - And I'll take care of it. - No! He just drinks all her beer and passes out. - What is... What? What? - Mama. - What? - You don't have to slave for nobody. - Yeah. - You don't have to show us what a saint you are all the time. - Yeah, we already know. - What is that? What is that? You want me to wash it? Want me to- - Come on, Ma, just take it. - I'll wash it. Get it off, I don't want that dirty money. I do honest work. Will you listen to her? Will you listen to her? You gotta do something with her. You gotta talk to her. I think she'll listen to you. Be careful of the iron. - It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. Yeah. - Yeah, it's gonna be terrific. Every night I think they're gonna wake me up, ring my bell, tell me you're dead in an alley somewhere. - Oh, Mama. It's never gonna happen. Never. - Yeah. - We always go through the same thing, am I right? Huh? - Yeah. - I got it under control. No problem. - It's got you under control. - No, it doesn't! I'm gonna talk to her. I didn't do nothing, Johnny. - 15 years old and already she's a tramp! - I'm an escort, Ma. Oh. - You're an escort. What is that? Is that the uptown name for a whore, huh? When you sell your ass for Alphabet City, you're a whore. Okay? - Oh, Johnny. Johnny, I don't sell my ass. They pay me for the privilege of my company. I don't even have to come across. It's a goddamn joke, I'm telling you, Johnny. - It's not a joke. You know that. - Yeah? - It's no joke. - Well listen to this, big brother. A limo. Uh-huh. A limo is coming to take me to Park Avenue. Some big doctor or a lawyer. Johnny, look at me. I ain't gonna end up like Mama, having those old bums lying around me in my old age. - You shut up your mouth! You don't ever talk about Mama like that. You understand? - Johnny, Johnny, I didn't mean nothing against Mama. It's just that I don't like all those dead beats trying to catch me in my underwear, you know? - What? What? What are you, Miss Bashful, now all of a sudden, huh? - Maybe. - Look at yourself, Sophia, look at yourself. - What's wrong, huh? - You're giving them plenty of chances, babe. Hmm? Now, let me tell you something. Let me tell you. When you get sick, and you can't work, what do you think is gonna happen, huh? - Sick? - You know what? You ask those other chicks what happens. Ask them. - Johnny. Johnny. I ain't like those wasted broads that work for Gino. I go uptown, strictly uptown. - How do you think those wasted broads started out? Huh? They was just like you, Sophia. They was thinking they're special. They're special. They're gonna live some good life, humping the uptown trade. But you know something? They're all down here now. All of them. Working for a goddamn pimp and none of them was ever special. Is that what you want? Oh, baby, you're gonna have the best. I guarantee it. But you ain't gonna get it the way you're going about it. Now, listen to me. You and Mama gotta get out of the building tonight. They're gonna torch it. - Who's gonna torch the building? - It don't matter who. You don't wanna know. It's economics, you know, the... The real estate, property values, etcetera. Somebody wants to make a killing. And they don't care if they have to Kill a few people to do it. You and Mama just gotta get out. - Why can't you stop 'em, huh? - I can't stop them. - Wait, wait, Johnny. I thought you were their golden boy. Big man on his way up. Big man on the streets. Alphabet Johnny. Why can't you stop them, huh? -'Cause I'm the man with the matches. - You? You're gonna do it? And you can't say no, huh? - Sophia. Suppose I say no? - Yeah? - It's still gonna go. All I can do is get you and Mama out of here. - What the fuck you want from me, huh? I got a date. This is your problem, big brother, you hear me? It's yours. Maria? Maria! Maria, come into the house now. Don't talk back to me. - Bye, Ma. Bye, Johnny. - I'm not going anywhere. - Mama. What do you mean you're not going anywhere? You don't go, you die. - I'd rather die. - For Christ's sake, Mama. I mean, what... I buy you any kind of place you want. Anything. Huh? We can all get away from this goddamn hell. Ma. Ma. Do it for me. All right? Do it for me. Okay? Come on, why you wanna stay here? - 'Cause it's my life and I don't want to hand it out to a bunch of cheap hoods. You scared? Tough guy. Tough guy. Not me! I don't scare so easy. They want me out of here, they can carry me out. You like that? Maybe you don't understand that. Maybe it's time you did. - Johnny? - Sophia.
