- Hey, would you turn that down? - What are you doing with that? - For fuck's sake, Kathy! Ow! Kathy! - Amber! - I've been a bad girl, Daddy. Looks like I have the house to myself. - You should come to the Great Debate. It's really quite exciting. - Thanks. - Watch it, skank. - Okay, before we get started, how about it for the Wolves winning Friday night's game, huh? Yeah. Now if they keep it up, River Falls will be bringing home the first championship trophy in, like, 10 years. - Our guys have the season in the bag, Jeff. - Let's hope so, and it's Professor Milbern, Victoria. Boundaries. - Sorry, professor. - I'll let it go this time. Only because you're filled with so much school spirit. Anyway, South Carolina was the first to secede from the Union, December 9th, 1860, followed by Mississippi, January 19th, 1861. Now, this was a major turning point in American history. Write this down, guys. This will be on your next quiz. - Damn man, those Pis are slammin'. Yeah, but they're more trouble than their worth. - I'll put up with their shit if it meant hittin' that. Fair trade. She's got it going on. - Hey Steph, hold up. - God, what does he want? - Hi, Vargas. - Hey, how's it going? - I'm good. - You're seriously not talking to this behemoth, are you? - Jade, what the hell? - What's your problem? - Sisters of Omega Pi are expected to date people of certain standards and you don't come close. - Jade, got a minute? My friend Dina was asking about you. - Oh, the cheerleader? - Yeah. Turns out she goes both ways. - Ooh. - Sorry about that. - Oh, that's fine. I could care less what she thinks. - Well, good. 'Cause I have a very different opinion. - Oh yeah? So, if that's the case, how about we go out sometime? - I'd like that. - This weekend? - You sure you won't be too hungover from the Wolves rager? - That's a good point. But, I think I could pull through. - Yeah? - For you, I could. - Oh well, will I see you at the Lambda party tonight? - Maybe. - Oh, we'll be there. Someone's gotta bring the keg. - I know, right? Last time the Lambdas went dry halfway through the party. - I know, who gets a keg for a kegger? - Tell Dina I said hi. - You got it. - We gotta go. - All right, Romeo, let's go get the package. - And that concludes our class for today. Next week, we'll talk about the slave states that refused to separate from the Union and the role it played in the war. You guys have a great day. - Professor Milbern? - Yeah. - I just wanted to say that I thought your lecture today was amazing. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the Industrial Revolution. - Ah well, we'll get to that later in the semester, Agnis. - Professor Milbern? I have a few questions about the lecture today. - Oh, we were just- - Well, actually, I think Victoria could actually use a little help. Not everyone's acing this class, Agnis. - Yeah, Agnis. I could use the help badly. - I could tutor you. - You know, Agnis, let me do my job here, huh? I got it. - Anyone down here? - Go away. - You okay? - I'm fine, now leave me alone. - You don't seem fine. - Then I guess you didn't need to ask if I was okay. - Right. Listen. If you're upset about Milbern and that skank from class, you're wasting your tears. - Why would I care about them? - Oh, come on. It's obvious you have a thing for him. - He has no interest in me. Nobody does. - Well, that's not true. I'm sure there's plenty of guys that would want you. - You don't have to do this. - No, but you look like you could use a friend. - Thanks. It was silly of me to think that we could ever be something. - Ah, you don't want a guy that takes advantage of the students, anyway. Come on. - I guess you're right. Sometimes I wish I could just be like them. - Oh please, you're so much better than them, and you could look just as good as them, you just need, you just need a bit of a makeover. - Yeah, I wish. - Let's do it. You can borrow some of my clothes and I'll do your hair and makeup. - Why are you being so nice to me? - Us outsiders need to stick together. - But you're not an outsider. You're beautiful. - Looks don't make a person, Agnis. Be at my place at eight. - 8:00 p.m., I'll be there. It's nice to have a friend. - Best friends. - Whoa, whoa whoa. I told you before, we need to be careful. - What? So you can fuck me, but you can't give me a kiss. - Not out here, I can't. Jesus Christ. Smarten up, Victoria. You know, if you tried just a little bit in your classes, you might have a little common sense. I gotta go. - Fuck you! What the fuck is your problem? - This smells like common rejection. Looks like you're the one with the problem. - You stay the fuck away from me, you crazy bitch. - Hey. - Amber, I wasn't sure if you were home. - Oh, sorry. I was on a call with my parents. - That's a lot of clothes. - Yeah. Some used to be my mother's but she doesn't need 'em anymore. You can take some home with you if you want. - Oh, I couldn't. - Well, I insist. Let's get started. - No, he's way too ugly. You're out of control. - Hey skanks, your dealer's here. - Get your life together, girl. - And how are you gorgeous ladies doing tonight? Wait a second, wait. There seems to be a bitchy presence missing. - Oh, Courtney? Who knows. - That bitch is barely a Pi, anyways. - Slut. - Hi, Josh. - Honey, there ain't a pill in this bag that'll ever make that happen. - God, Vicky, lay off the guy. - Okay, so what to do we want to do tonight? Do we want to trip, roll, or fly? - Do you wanna dance tonight? - Yes. - Let's roll. - That is a fine choice. We can do one each. - Let's make it two. - Ooh, you naughty, naughty, naughty girls. That'll be $200, please. Ew. - So, what do you guys think? - Ah! - Ooh. You must be making smoke signals 'cause you are hot. Ow, harder. Ooh! - Well, if you like that one, wait 'til you see mine. - Oh. - So, you're staying for the fashion show? - Oh, what could be better? Oh, handcuffs. Oh, you know, I like it big and black. Oh yeah, come on, bad boy. Put me in jail, cuff me up. Oh yeah. - Who do you think looks the sexist? - Well, all you bitches are, like, super sexy and stuff, but, well, I always had a thing for law enforcement. Sexy cop. - That's right, bitches. - Yeah. - You only picked her so she won't bust you. - Well, now that we're all dressed, let's get the party started. - Oh. - Assaulting an officer? - And, the finishing touches. We're done. - I'm so nervous. - Don't be. You're beautiful. No, don't. You look fine with them on. Change your hair and change your makeup, but don't change who you are. - I'm beautiful. - This will fit Agnis perfectly. Thank you, Mother. - Amber? - There you are. - You scared me. - I'm sorry. I wanted to give you this. - It's getting late, I should probably go. - I'll walk you out. - There you go, Sexy. - Hey! - You too, party tonight at Alpha Lambda. - Fuckin' frat pig. - Whoa, hey! You actually came to my party. You want a drink? - Yeah. Why don't we skip the party and just go up to your room? - Hell yeah. My room's upstairs, let's go. - This party sucks. I'm taking the keg with me. - All right, I hope you're ready. - You got a condom? - Oh right, I got it covered. Well, I got me covered. - Wow. I gotta cut back. Those rolls are crazy. Hey guys, I'm gonna go get some air. Does anybody want to join me? Guys? - Hey. - Hey. So, you're delivering kegs, now? - No. I just stole this one from a party. - That's so messed up. - Well, they won't miss it. Party was dead, anyway. - So, you're just wandering around with a keg? - What about you? - What about me? - Just standing around, dressed like a sexy Indian? - Oh, I was trying it on, I needed some air. What do you think? - It looks all right. - Gee, thanks. - I think you're the sexist Indian I've ever seen. Anyway, I should really get this back to the house. I'd walk you in but security's actually right there. See you tomorrow? - Yeah, definitely. - Is that Agnis? - Not the Agnis we saw yesterday. - That girl is such a freak. - Hey, looking good. - Yeah, thanks to you. - Where is the necklace I gave you? - Oh, I didn't feel like wearing it today. It's nothing personal. - You didn't feel like wearing it? - Yeah, it's no big deal. - You have no idea what I have done for you. I thought we were friends. - Forget freak, that bitch is crazy. - Wait, where is she going? - I don't know. - Hi. Agnis, right? - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I don't know what just happened. - Do you want to go to a party tonight? - With you? - With us, come on. These are my sorority sisters. Stephanie, Jade and Courtney. Girls, this is Agnis. - That's a unique name. - Yeah, my mom named me for my great grandmother. - No shit. Well, if you want to sell it, you have to go all the way. - That name is just about as ugly as you were yesterday. You should change it. - What is wrong with you? - What? - She's right. How about Angie? Such a pretty name for a pretty girl. - I like Angie. - Okay, Angie. So, do you want to come to a party? - Yeah, I guess I could go with you. - Great, it's a costume party. - Yeah, so make sure to wear something sexy. - We all are. I'm going to be a sexy Pocahontas. - Oh, I don't think I have anything sexy. - Oh, you're smart girl. Use that big brain, I'm sure you could think of something. - You can meet us at the Lambda Psi house tonight. - See you there, Angie. - Bye. - Okay. - I mean, seriously? - Stupid! It was just a necklace, what's wrong with you? You're so stupid! God! - Oh my God. - Get out! - Crazy. - God! One. Two. Three. Four. Five. You just apologize, then everything will be fine. - So what's with playing nice with Agnis? - Yeah, doesn't that bitch want Milbern? - Let's get this straight, I can't stand her. Besides, that psycho bitch seems to be pretty attached to nerdy, little Agnis. So, we make her one of us, then we turn her out to the drunk frat guys at the Wolves' rager. - Oh my God, you're terrible. - Bitches deserve it. - For what, daydreaming over her professor? - That, and pissing off the baddest slut in school. - I may be bad but I'm not a fucking slut, you dyke. - You tried to screw our gay drug dealer less than eight hours after fucking your professor. - So? - Slut. - Agnis, you look different. - Thanks. You like? You look very nice. - Angie, come sit with us. We saved you a seat. - Everything okay, Amber? - Psycho! - Courtney, shut it. - Hey, let her go, she's crazy. She slapped you over a necklace. - Whoa, take it easy, miss. Hey, I'm the dean of this college and you will listen to me. Behavior like this could lead to expulsion. - Well, we don't want that now, do we? - Goddamn, you ladies are looking fine. - Have a little class, brother. You girls do look good, though. - Thanks, I guess chivalry isn't dead. - No costume for you, big boy? - Don't bust me, officer. I have a mask inside. - Yeah, he nearly lost the keg earlier wearing a mask. - Yeah, I can't see shit in that thing. - Well then, I guess we'll see you guys inside. - Oh yeah, you'll catch a cold out here dressed like that, though. - Hey, have you seen Vargas around? - Vargas? Really? - What? He's a good guy. - He's an animal. - You girls gotta give the guy a break. I mean, he keeps me safe on the field. - Not to mention he nearly kills everything he hits. - All right, we gotta get this thing aside. Vargas is around here somewhere. - Who's first for keg stand? - Where the hell is this bitch? I'm freezing my tits out here. - Okay well, if you can't handle it, then go inside with Courtney. - Excuse me? - Holy shit, would you look at that? - It's pathetic. - I think she looks good. - She looks hot. - We'll see what she can do. - Hi, guys. Do we look like guys to you? - Come on, you know what she meant. - Sorry, ladies. - Hi, Agnis. - It's Angie now, remember? - Do you want to be called Angie? - Jesus Christ, it's just a name. Much better than fucking Agnis. - I'm just saying. - And I'm just saying we're wasting our time. We're here to party, not this shit. - Let's go. - You girls ready to get fucked up? - Time to cut loose. You're running with us, now. - Think you can hang with Omega Pi? - Fuck it. Let's get wasted. - You girls look like you need a drink. - Hey QB, you just scored six points. - Oh, touchdown! - I'll touch down. - How fucking high school are you, Vargas? - You know what, Courtney? It's a fucking party, try and have a good time. - Vargas, take it easy, brother. - Do you wanna get out of here? - Yeah, I'd like that. - Stephanie, you're not seriously going to leave with this pathetic, pencil-dicked fat fuck, are you? I mean, come on, the mascot's, like, a step up from him. - Come on, let's get out of here before I do somethin' I regret. - Sorry, Vargas, I think I should stay. - You kidding me? - You heard her. - And she calls me pathetic. You know what, fuck you, sorority cunts. - You can better than him tonight, don't worry about that. - Yeah, but you were pretty harsh on him. - He's a big boy. I'd be more worried about the next dude that pisses him off. - We've been here for less than an hour and you bitches are killing the fun. Enough with the drama, 'et's go and get some drinks. - We should find Josh. I heard he brought some good shit. - Hell yeah, let's get fucked. - In more than one way, girl. - Hi, you two look great. - Well, you don't look so bad yourself. - Thanks. - What are your names? - Mark. - Keith. - I'm Victoria, and this is our newest pledge, Angie. - Pledging, huh? - Yeah. I've always wanted to be a sister of Omega Pi. - So, you two wanna get a drink and get out of here? - Oh, I don't think- - That sounds great. Right, Angie? - Yeah, terrific. - Come on. - So, this is where you boys are hiding all the booze. Thank you. To a good night. - Cheers. - Cheers. - So what? Drinking not your thing? - No, not really. - Well. Well, maybe rolling's more your thing. - Hell yeah, I knew you boys wouldn't disappoint. Excuse me. - Jesus. - Come on, Ange. You don't want to be a prude, do you? - I won't let anything happen to you. We'll be fine. - Do you want to be a Pi or not? - Now we're talkin'. - Bottom's up, boys. - Ooh, all right? - I don't feel anything. - Just give it a few minutes. You will. This will help, trust me. Looks like that's hittin' you kinda hard. Do you want to go lay down? - Yeah. - Yeah? I got ya. - Wait, where, where? - Bye. - Ooh. - I feel funny. - Don't worry, I'm going to take really good care of you. You know, you're very sexy. - Thank you. What are you? No. - Shh. - No, no. - Shh. It's okay. - No. - Shh. - No, don't. Stop. - Fuck off, I'll be done in a minute. Fuck off, I said. Thanks for the easy lay. What the fuck is your problem, hmm? Oh. - Hey, big guy. Ready for round two? - I guess it's my lucky night. - Guess it is. - You're gonna have your work cut out for you because I literally just blew my load in this bitch. I hope you don't mind if she stays. - Looks like it's your turn to get fucked, asshole. I'll call you tomorrow, baby. I'll get you home real soon. Just gotta clean this up first. After all, what are best friends for? - Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug! - How are you doing? - Oh, very lightheaded. - Here, drink this. It's gonna help. - Thank you. How did I get here? - Well, you got wasted with those Omega Pi skanks, but I took care of you. - They're not skanks. They're my friends. - I'm your friend, Agnis. - Don't call me that. - I don't understand why you're treating me like this. I am your only real friend. Those other girls let you get raped and let you get drugged. I would kill for you. Can you say the same about any one of them? - I think I should go. Thank you for the juice. - I don't understand why you are treating me like this after everything I have done for you. - We barely know each other. We hung out one time and I appreciate the makeover, but Jesus Christ, you're acting like a freak. - You have no idea what I have done for you, Agnis. I am giving this relationship everything, and you are spitting it back in my face. - Amber, what are you doing with that fork? - We were outsiders, but we were there together, and then you had to go and join Omega Pi. - You're scaring me. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Agnis. - I don't think we should see each other. You obviously have some issues that you need to deal with. - Don't leave me! No! Stupid. I'll make you see who you really are. But first, I gotta cut a few Pis. - Well, look who it is. I guess you can hang with us after all. - Hi, Angie. - So, did that Lambda guy rock your world last night? - Victoria, could I talk to you for a minute? - Hey, if you're upset I left you there last night, I just figured you wanted to spend the night with him. - The thing is, I don't really remember what happened last night and I woke up at Amber's place. - The freak from class? - Don't call her that. - Well you drank a little and took some E. We had a good time. - Amber's saying that I was raped and it does kind of hurt down there. - No, you were totally into him, and if it's been awhile, it's normal to be a little sore. - Oh my God. I don't even remember my first time? - No, okay. I'm sure you'll remember the next time. - Next time? But I don't even know who he was. - Not with him. With someone else. Telling ya, you have plenty to choose from. Who wants to tell our newest addition what tonight is? - It's the annual Omega Pi rave. - It's the most hottest, discreet party to get laid at. - I don't know if I should go to that. - You don't have to have sex, Angie. It's just a good time with your girls. - All the Pi sisters are going. You want to pledge Pi, right? - Yeah. - So then, don't be an Agnis, be a Pi. - And remember to wear pink. - Why pink? - It's just a tradition the Omega Pi sisters started a couple years ago. Wear whatever you want as long as it's pink. - We should get going. - Yeah. You don't want to miss Professor Candy-cane-dick's class. - Who? - Professor Milbern. He's got a crooked dick. - It's true, I've seen it. - Yeah, like, every Tuesday night after his wife is in bed. - Oh my God, you're having an affair? - Yeah, but it's nothing serious. - He'll probably bang you too, if he had the chance. - See you girls tonight. - Angie. Angie. - Nice of you to join us, Amber. - Agnis, we need to talk. - Amber, please take a seat and save the personal stuff for the halls, huh? - I don't have anything to say to you, especially not in the middle of class. - Hey, psycho bitch. Fuck off. - Courtney, Amber, last chance, take a seat, or get out of my classroom. - These are not your friends, Agnis. They let you get raped. - That's it Amber, you need to leave. - I really liked that guy and he really liked me, and I may not remember much about the party, but I had a good time. - Yeah, you did. - And, I'm gonna see him again. So, stop saying it was rape, you psycho bitch. - I can guarantee that you will never see him again. - Go. All right, guys. Show's over, back to your papers. - Now you're acting like a Pi. - You okay, Agnis? - Yeah I'm fine, thanks. I don't know what her problem is. - You know if anything did happen with that guy, I'm here to talk. - Oh my gosh, that's, like, so sweet of you. - Victoria, aren't you a little old for this sort of thing? - Oh, I'm sorry, Professor. It'll never happen again. - All right, that's it for today guys, I'll see you Monday. Read chapters four through six. Have a great weekend. Not you, Victoria. - Look, if it's about that drawing, you need to get over it. - No, that drawing was immature, but that's not why I asked you to stay. - Oh, I think I know what you need. - No, no, no. Not now, anyway. What are you girls doing with Agnis? - We're turning her into a Pi. - Yeah, I see that, but why? - What, we can't do something nice for fellow RFU Wolf? And I thought you were one for school spirit. - It's not exactly your MO. - Well, we're not up to anything, I swear. - That's good 'cause Agnis has a good future ahead of her. - Oh, it's Angie now. - You changed her name? - That was all her idea. - Right. - Enough about her. When do we get to play? - Well, tonight is the big Pi party, right? - Yeah, you wanna come? - No, but, I could maybe meet you in the basement downstairs. - Oh, you want to get tied up again, don't you? - Maybe you can wear that new Halloween costume, everyone says it looks so hot on you. - Think I can arrange that. I gotta go get ready. - Okay. I'll be by after I pick up my son from soccer. - So, you think Cedric's gonna be there? - Of course he is, the way it was with you last time. They're predictable. They come every time. - Right. Oh, well, if it isn't Professor Candy Cane. Oh, don't worry, your secret's safe with me. - Just so you know, I don't want to miss too much of the party screwing in the basement, so if you could come around 10, that'd be great, thanks. - Victoria. - Hmm? - I'll text you when I get there. - Bye, Jeff. - Don't hold back. Let go of Agnis. You can do this. - Where are you going? - One of us. One of us! One of us! - Relax, it's just us. - Glad you came. - What are you doing, she's not a Pi. - Relax, it's just a mask for a party. - It's our Pi's tradition. - It's okay, I don't have to wear it. - No, you do, actually. She'll pledge when it's time. - I don't get what they see in you, but they vouch for you. So, you get to pledge. - How are we supposed to drink through these? - We're not drinking tonight. - Where's my favorite gay boy? - I saw him working over some other guy in the other room. - Let's go find him. - Wait, what are we doing? - Oh, don't worry, you're gonna love it. - There's our favorite boy toy. - Oh, hi ladies. - What are you wearing? - Oh, do you like it? I'm an honorary Pi. - Sweet cherry pie. - Oh, no, no, no. This slice is reserved for a little pre-med hunk. - Lucky boy. - Mm. That he is. Who's the new girl? - Don't take your mask off. What? She wants to pledge, right? So, I'm gonna treat her like one. - Sorry. - I'm sorry, sister. Don't just nod, say it. - Jade, seriously, that's enough. - I'm sorry, sister. - And this is why I'm not in a frat. - Oh, please, I've seen you in plenty of frats. - Okay, fine. You got me. I have commitment issues. - So, do you have our candy? - Oh yes, yes, of course. You must be gone. I don't mix business with pleasure. Are you ready? - Mm-hm. Do I swallow? - If you're anything like me you do. But with this, just let it melt in your mouth. - Let's go! - Don't worry, no need to thank me! Bitches. - All right, man. Let's get some Pi. What's wrong with you? - Man, I'm sick of these fucking Pis. - It's that Stephanie chick, isn't it? - No, fuck her, too. - Dude, she's just playing the role as a Pi. Yo, I'll get Victoria away from her. She'll be fine. - Yeah? - Yeah. For once, let me clear the way for you. - All right. - All right? - Yeah. Let's go. Go get her. - Agnis, Agnis, Agnis. - You wanna be a Pi? - Oh, what's the matter, Angie? - Haver you seen Courtney? - Please, just leave me alone! - What's wrong with her? - We're just having fun. - Have you guys seen Courtney? - Fuck that bitch. Dance with us. - One of us, one of us, one of us, one of us. One of us, one of us. - Hey Steph, can I talk to you? - That's gonna have to wait. They're fucked up on something. - Damn it Victoria, would you pick up? - Please leave your message. - Fuck it. Damn it, Jeff, what are you even doing here? Okay. - That was intense. - What did you take? - Some of Josh's candy. - Well, that's vague. - So's my memory tonight. Shit, I gotta go. - Where could you possibly have to go? - I have some extra credit with, for Professor Milbern. - Like we all don't know you're blowing him. - Hey, we're not gonna say anything. - It was pretty obvious. - Where do you think you're going? - Oh, I didn't think you were coming. - Sorry I'm tardy, Professor. - You know something? This would have been a lot hotter if you'd have kept your promise. - What'd I do wrong? - Well, remember you were suppose to wear your new, sexy costume. - Could go change into it and make it up to you. - Oh, now that's my girl. Oh, what are you doing? - I just want to make sure you don't go anywhere. - I don't think this is such a good- - Don't worry. I'll change and come right back. - Oh, what if somebody comes down here? Oh boy. Courtney? If Victoria put you up to this, I'm not laughing. - I am not that bitch, Courtney. - Amber is that, what are you doing? Is that a chainsaw? - Professor Milbern, taking advantage of your students- - I'm not taking advantage of any- - Nah, nah, dah, dah. It's a shame you're such a pig, because I actually kind of enjoyed your class. - I'm not taking advantage of anybody. I don't know where you get your information- - Now is not the time for a lecture, Professor. - Amber, what are you doing? Hey. What the fuck Amber, come on! Amber, come on! Amber. - Ooh, okay. I'm sorry. Now is not a good time to be laughing, is it? - Amber, please. It's time that I teach you a lesson, Professor. - Please Amber, don't! - Professor, try to have some balls. No! God, no! - You guys hear that? - I don't hear anything but this party starting to die. - Well, it sounds like a chainsaw or something. - That's probably Daisy using the vibrator. That thing should be considered a power tool. - Wanna get out of here and get some air? - Yeah, I'd like that. - I'd like that. - Are you ready, Professor? Jeff, are you in here? Okay, fuck you too. I'm going back to the party. - It's nice out. - Yeah, it is. Though, I'm surprised you're not seeing UFOs out there. - UFOs? - Yeah, with all that shit Josh sells you Pis? - What, like you don't party? - I do my fair share, mostly booze and pot, though. - I suppose we do kind of get out of hand. - Yeah, you gotta have some fun, sometimes, huh? - Yeah. - Oh fuck, disgusting. - Oh man. - I think I've had enough fresh air. - Looks like the Pi is officially dead, huh? - What are you, a mortician? - What's with the outfit change? - Turns out nothing. Can't find my professor. - That's weird. Angie's been missing all night. You don't think the two of them? - Oh please, she probably ran home after doing acid. - You never know, she could be making it to your sweet professor right now. - Don't listen to her. Angie will get hers tomorrow night. - What do you got planned? - We're going to bring her to the Pis with a bang. - A gang bang, that is. - Wait, Agnis wants to have a gang bang? - It's always the quiet ones. - Oh, she has no clue. We're gonna roofie her. - You guys are still going through with that? - Hell yeah, we are. - That's horrible, I want nothing to do with it. She seemed to really be coming out of her shell and you seemed to like her. - We got them acting skills. - That's some fucked up shit. - You got that right. - You think the Alpha Sigs will actually go through with it? - Not this one. - Not me, either. Too sloppy. I bet Bobby's down, though. - Yeah, he is. - That is so gross. I'm glad I got one of the good ones. - Speaking of the good ones, I got me a fine piece of ass waiting for me, from earlier, at the house. I'll see you guys later. - Yeah, I should probably get going, too. - You could stay with me. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Baby, I'll stay with you tonight. - Yeah! Oh yeah! - Oh shit, Steph. - Oh my God, Angie, are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks. - Let's get you cleaned up. - Hey, I'm gonna head home. I'll see you tonight, yeah? - Yeah, definitely. I had a great night. - Me too. Hope you feel better. - Thanks. - So, what happened last night? I thought you went home. - What I should have known would've happened. I freaked out and I ran up here to hide, and I ended up crying myself to sleep. - Oh honey, I think we've pushed you too fast. - No, it's my fault. - This was a perfectly Agnis thing to do. I'm just not good enough. I'm not like you. - Hey, don't say that. I didn't fit in at first, either. Hell, I still don't think I do. Sorority life can be tough. Sometimes, I think it might even kill you, but it gets better. - Thanks for being so nice to me. - Hey, you know, the girls are gonna invite you to this big party tonight. Maybe you should sit this one out, you know, recoup from last night. - No, I can't. I've never had any friends before and if I don't go, then they're not gonna let me pledge. - What about that Amber girl? And do you even want to pledge Omega Pi? - Amber was nice at first, but then she got really weird and I didn't really want to pledge but then I see how close all of you are, and I want that. - Well, if they give you any more drugs, you don't have to take them. - Oh, hey, what's going on here? - Oh, Angie had a rough time. - No, I'm fine, really. - Great, tonight's a big party. - Yeah, Steph was just telling me. - I hope she didn't undersell it. You're going, right? - Of course. I wouldn't miss it for the world. - That's my girl. - Well, I have to go, but I'll see you at the party. - Yeah, see you tonight. - What did you tell her? - Don't worry, I didn't say anything about your fucked up plan. - Better not have, or you might just take her place. - Fuck you. - Hey guys, guys, the Pis have a pledge that's gonna let 'em gang bang her tonight At the Go Wolf rager. You gotta go. - Fuck yeah, always wanted to get some Pi. - I heard they're going to be wearing those sexy ass costumes again, too. Hell yeah. - All right, tell your brothers. We need plenty of cream for this Pi, all right? - You got it. - Cool. - If these sorority twats want sexy, I'll give 'em sexy. Hi, Mother. May I use your sewing machine? Why, thank you. Now, to decide what materials to use. Oops! Sorry, Professor. Something's missing. I'm gonna need a mask. No, not you. I have something special planned for you. Must be destiny. What? Don't judge me. She's a whore just like the rest of 'em. Professor Milbern? I'm here. Are we playing hide and seek? I've got a cheer for you, Professor. Give me a D. Give me an I. Give me a C. Give me a K. What's that spell? - Slut. - No, it spells dick. - Well, it's a good thing you are so pretty because you are dumb as fuck. - The fuck is this? - Seriously. - Thank God for the calvary. - This is the Wolf rager? Seriously lean, guys. - Hey, everyone's too afraid to come out after that Lambda guy got killed. - Somebody was killed on campus? How come we don't know about that? - Because nobody gives a fuck about stoner Lambdas. - Yeah, they found the dean dead in a storage closet, too. - Yeah, plus a few people are going missing. It's fucked. - That's terrible. - Well, I'm not gonna let a couple of dead nobodies ruin the biggest party of my life. - That's talking like a Pi. Where are the shots, boys? Let's get this party started. - That's what I'm talking about. - Lead the way. - You know your friends are warped, right? - Yeah, but maybe with the fail of a party, so will their plans for Angie. - We weren't actually gonna let that happen. - Do you promise? - I swear. But in the process, let's try and have a good night. - Sounds like a perfect night to me. - My man, to a good night. - Cheers. - Woo! - Hey, look at you. - Hi. Yeah, I thought I'd say goodbye to the old Agnis once and for all. - Well, as long as you're happy, that's really great. - Why wouldn't I be happy? You know, I thought there'd be more people here. - Well, maybe it's a good thing there's not. - Really? - Yeah, come hang with Vargas and me. - Oh look, the guest of honor's arrived. - Damn, she looks fine, though. Good for her this party sucks. - Yeah well, it doesn't matter how many guys are here if little Miss Guilt-trip, over there, talks her into leaving. - Steph'll bitch out, but she's a Pi. She'll keep her mouth shut. - She better, took a lot of effort to get this going. - Agnis, you want a drink? - It's Angie now, remember? - Right, sorry. - It's okay. I'll have whatever you're having. - Angie! I'm so glad you made it. We have something planned for you tonight. - Really? What? - It's a surprise, after which you'll be a full-fledged Omega Pi. - Oh my God, thank you. Oh, I've never belonged anywhere. - Congrats, Angie. - Come on, let's dance. - Hold on a second. I'll see you guys later. That cheerleader's looking too good to pass up. - Make sure you come up for some air, slut. - What, what does that mean? - You're kidding, right? - Jade's a lesbian, she's gonna- - She's gonna eat it out. - Do I get to see your face? I get it. You're nervous. Oh, you're not nervous. - Look at me, you fucking slut. - So you can talk. - Hey brother, I think you should get some alone time with Steph. - Ah, I can't man, I told her I'd look after Agnis. - I'll make sure nothing happens to her. - I don't think she'll go for that. - We're a team. If you can't trust me, who're you gonna trust? Besides, I plan on keeping Victoria plenty busy. - Yeah, all right. But, look out for that bitch. She's pure evil, man. - I got you. - Double up on the condoms too, no telling what she's got. - Let's go for a walk? - What about Angie? - Cedric will look after her. She'll be fine. - Okay. A little alone time would be nice. Hey Angie, be right back, okay? - Okay. - You look like you could use a drink. - Thanks. I'm having a really great time. Thank you for being so nice to me. - Now you're ready to become a Pi? - Yeah. - Great, meet us upstairs in Bobby's room, first door on the left. - You're not gonna, like, make me fuck a sheep or something, are you? - Honey, that's only in frat legend. Don't worry, it's nothing you can't handle. - Okay. - I hope that bitch gets pregnant. - Yo, yo, yo, you up for doing a funnel? - No, it's all good, bro. - Come on. - I'm good, I'm good. - You? - You're fucking kidding me, right? - What? - Anyway, I need you to gather your pathetic frat brothers and meet Agnis and I in your room in an hour. I'm going to initiate her. - Shit, I'm in, but I'm first, it's my room. Greg's in for sloppy seconds, right, Greg? - Whatever, I don't care. Just bring as many guys as you can. - You got it. But, first things first. Pledge! I got it. - What? - He's gonna blow. - I don't have time for this, I'm gonna go find Josh. - Either wait or use the sink. - Fuckin' frat pig. It's occupied. - So, what are you doing here, part of a sorority that you have nothing in common with? - Well, what does anybody do here? - Well, most people I know, they're either just here for the frat life, or to play sports. - Well, I'm a psychology major and the parties are just a perk. What about you? - Technically I'm a business major, but mostly just here for football. - Really, that's it? - That's it. Well, that and making out with beautiful sorority girls. - Really? - Particularly Psych majors. - You killed her! Steph. Please. - I drank too much. - No, stay awake. Don't be an Agnis. - Don't be an Agnis. - Don't be an Agnis. - Where the hell is everybody? - Hey, that's quite the outfit you got there. I like a girl who's not afraid to show a little skin. - I'm glad you like it. - If looks could kill, I would be in trouble. - Oh, I'd say you're already in trouble. - No, no! - Cedric, Cedric! - Well, I guess that gives new meaning to the phrase swallow my pride. - Fuck, let me up, let me up, let me up! I don't like! - Hey, Angie. Poor Agnis. All you ever wanted was friends. Well tonight, you'll have plenty of friends. Oh, and I know how upset you were that you didn't remember your first time, but with this video online, you'll never be able to forget this. - I am way too high for this shit. I just wanted to fucking have bathroom sex and this is what fucking happens. - Showtime. Hope you guys are ready to wreck this bitch. - What the fuck are you doing? Let me go. - All right. Let's just skip the begging and the, "Why are you doing this, why is this happening to me?" BS, because I am not gonna let you go. So, if at any point you do feel the need to beg, just try to be interesting. Oh, I really wouldn't bother with that. See, I got kind of into bondage and it turns out I am pretty good at tying knots. - Who are you? I knew you were crazy but this is a whole 'nother fucking level. - Hey now, that's not gonna help your case if you do decide to beg at any point. We are ready. - What? No, you can't. - Oh see, yes I can. You're tied up. Now, this might hurt a bit. - No, it was just a joke. We weren't actually going to do anything. Please! Please! Please! - Oh, it's stuck. - Please don't, I'm sorry. - This might hurt a bit. Help me. - Agnis. - My name is Angie! - After everything I have done for you, you would try to kill me? - Dear God, I swear that if you let me live tonight, I will go clean. Maybe. - Oh my God, oh my God, Vargas! Wake up, please. Wake up, wake up, wake up. - Are you okay? - Am I okay? You have a flagpole coming out of your chest. - Oh fuck, I forgot about that. You gotta pull it out. - No, no, then you'll bleed even more. - There's a gun in the bar under the sink cabinet. You gotta get it. - Why do you have a gun? - Just get it, it doesn't matter. - Okay. - The safety. Turn it off. - Okay, okay. - Go! - Okay, okay! - 911, what's the emergency? - Someone just stabbed my boyfriend. We're at the Alpha Sigma house, there's a whole bunch dead students everywhere, please send somebody! - How you chose them over me, after everything I have done for you. - We hung out one time! Help! Somebody, please! - I don't know what I ever did to you. I was ready to forgive you for everything, and then you had to go- - Shit. Are you okay? - I just hurt my ankle. What is wrong with her? - Tell you after I finish my psych classes. Go wait for them on the front porch. Tell them to send a paramedic to the back. Vargas is hurt bad. - Okay. Hey, Steph? Thanks for saving my life. - What are friends for? - What's wrong? - God, you asshole, I thought you were dead. - You can't get rid of me that easy. I heard gunshots. - I got her. - I thought we weren't supposed to take it out. - Extenuating circumstances. - The ambulance is on its way, okay? Gonna take good care of him. - Hey man, my girlfriend's a hero. I'm sure she is. - Your girlfriend, huh? - Yeah, unless I don't meet Omega Pi standards. - To hell with Omega Pi. - I'll take you around the side, you'll be right there with him. - And I woke up and she was stabbing her and she was dead and there was blood everywhere. I ran down the hallway and I ran downstairs and I slipped on some blood, and she attacked me. And that's when Stephanie, she got a gun from somewhere and she shot her. She just... She shot her? - Unloaded the entire gun, and shot her. She saved my life. - Are you a real cop or a fake cop? - It's okay, Josh. Come on over. - Okay, so I'm, like, really, really high right now but I swear to God I just witnessed someone murder my boyfriend. Well, he's not really my boyfriend, we were just fooling around and he has a really big dick, but I was, like, really, really too funny to die and I'm too pretty to die. Do you role play? - We'll have to talk about that when we get to the station, Josh, but it's okay. Come on over. I'll give you a ride back, Angie's gonna come with us. - I bet she's still in there, though. Can you protect me? Okay, okay.
