[buzzer sounds] [door opens, closes] Mr. Russell? You know the routine. Place your hands on the wall for me. See you later, and when you're done, let's talk. [typing on keyboard] In accordance of Texas State Department of Corrections maximum status release, you've met the three-month mandatory contact standard. It's my determination that you are in compliance with the conditions of your parole. You've found employment, passed all mandatory drug screenings and are attending the required group therapy sessions for violent offenders. This is all, uh, noted in your personal file. Mr. Russell, how would you say things have been for you since your return to society? [knocks] [sniffles] [grunts] [pounds] I know what the fuck you're doing to me. [sniffles] [guard on radio] We're about finished here. Clear to exit? [phone dings] All clear. It's time. [engine starts] We're on, baby. [speaking Spanish] Don't move! Drop the fucking bags! Drop the bag! Thirty seconds! Turn around, hands on your head! Moving! Covering! [gun unloads] Get on your fucking knees! Set! Moving! Cover! All set! Moving! I'm set! I'm moving! Shoot! [gunshots] [robber 1] Come on, let's get the fuck out of here! Let's go, let's go! Come on! What did the fuck did you do? Hey, hey, hey! Heads up! Heads up! Fuck! God! Shit! The fuck is wrong with you? Just drive. [siren wails in distance] [cell phone rings] Hey, babe, what's up? [whispers] What? Define knife. All right, well, uh, I-- I can't talk about this right now. Well, right now is work, okay? We'll talk about it when I get home. It's okay. We'll figure it out. All right, well, tell baby girl I love her. I love you too. Fly in the ointment? Matthew took a knife to school. A knife? What is he, 14? He's 15. Are they expelling him? Well, I don't know. Sure hope not. Private school ain't cheap. Hell, education isn't cheap. I'm still paying off college loans. [chuckles] Yeah, maybe you could borrow some money from this crew. No shit. Evidence response team? No, we're just looking for a place to get some lunch. [chuckles] Yeah. I'm Special Agent Brett Solomon. FBI. Good to meet you. Special Agent Angela Jordan. Pleasure. Major Crimes Division. We appreciate the assist. Dan Pogue. Sheriff. So this is what the FBI looks like now, huh? Times are changing fast over there. Well, not fast enough, if you ask me. So, what's the MO? Well, we had three gunmen wearing masks carrying ARs, couple of Glocks. Lord knows what all. You wanna walk us through? Well, the, uh-- the guard, he came out of the bank carrying the money bags. The gunmen ambushed him from a SUV. One of the gunmen shot the guard. Driver witness it? Whole deal. Everything. [Brett] And where is he? She. Indoors. Let's go. [whirring] [whirring stops] That's the roundup, eh? Yeah. Well, little brother, you got, uh, 270 grand. Get him clean cash from the back. [clears throat] Just a quick question. What the fuck happened out there? It's on me. No doubt about that. When the feds are up my fucking ass, that's on you too. We all knew there was a risk. I could give two shits that you whacked a fucking pig, okay? I'm talking about the cowboy shit, all right? And if that shit comes back on me... there's gonna be fucking hell to pay. What are you saying? It simply means that if you back me in a fucking corner, and you leave me one option... Okay, different tact. Give me your word this is not coming back on me. Sixteen years inside, motherfucker. That's my word. You're as temperamental as your old man. How is Ruben? A fucking prick. You should go see him. Okay. So I'm gonna go with God and your word is good. What about, uh-- What about Superboy? Superboy? What are you talking about? Your brother. What about him? You vouch for him? He's my brother. That gives me so much solace. [sighs] You want a drink? Give me a minute. 'Cause I just got thrown something that you might be interested in. It's a bank job. Weekly cash delivery. Uh, armored car. Here's the thing. It is mid to high, six figures. And my inside guy Devland, he's the bank manager. He just wants to meet you. When? Next week. You interested? We sit down. Talk about the particulars. Yeah? Yeah, I'm in. Good. Before I forget, it's good to have you back. [door opens] All right, what can you tell us about 'em? Um, what-- what do you wanna know? Well, how did they come in? I mean, were they fast? Did they-- Did they seem like professionals? They-- They moved like a-- a SWAT team. Okay. Sounds tactical. Maybe military. Mm-hmm. Anything stand out? Any tattoos or distinguishing marks? I mean, one-- one spoke Spanish. Well, that narrows it down to about one-third of the population. The one-- The one that, um, held his-- his gun to me... had, uh-- he-- he was the leader. He just had this-- this look. How could you tell he was the leader? Oh, you-- you could just-- just tell. Fair enough. Anything else you can remember? One of the others shot-- shot Philip. Local PD found the drop car. Okay. Just give us a minute, okay? Be right back. Make it quick. Let me guess. Extra crispy? You got it. A Good Samaritan phoned it in, thought some honkies blew a meth lab. We're running the plates now. [Angela] Most likely stolen. [Brett] Where'd they find the car? Sending smoke signals a county over. Probably a waste of time and against my better judgment, but let's check the car for prints, DNA, hair, anything that can lead us back to these guys. Then let's check the VIN against any previous owners, and the title. You got it. Okay. My team will get in touch with you. We're real sorry for what happened to your partner. [sniffles] Th-Thank you. Look at me. I'm gonna get 'em. [clears throat, sniffles] [door opens] Where is he? [toilet flushes] [door opens] What the fuck took you so long? Did you go see Daddy? No. [unzips bag] Don't smoke in here. That's for you. Gracias. Hey. Where's mine? Is that the last one? [brother] I don't know. Go fucking check. Frisk the guard! That was your one job! I did, motherfucker! How am I supposed to know he had a fucking ankle piece? We don't shoot people. When someone pulls a fucking gun, you be prepared for when it goes off! Spare me the military bullshit. It doesn't impress me. It's not fucking bullshit. It's the fucking truth. A rule I fucking live by! There's one rule. We don't get caught. I didn't see the gun either, Gabe. I didn't. Fuck out of my face. [sighs] [brother] I fucked up. There you go. That what you wanted to hear? Hmm? What about that fucking bullshit out there? You think that's not gonna get us jailed? That's my fucking car. Gabe is right, man. You know the shop doesn't pay big wages. We gotta make this look good, baby. Yeah, whatever. I'm gonna hold on to your share. Until it cools down or until you grow the fuck up. Hold on. Come-- Come again. [scoffs] My fucking daddy now, paying me an allowance? It's my money! What happened to the 85 from the Southlake job? What happened to the 70 from the Flower Mound truck? Casino or strip club, motherfucker? [scoffs] Just shut the fuck up already. Fuck off my back. Did, uh... [sniffles] Did Rader mention he have any more work? I don't need Rader for jobs. I want you to stay away from him. Why? I didn't do time for him. I did. Stay out of his bar. That clear? You know, uh, I deserve to be part of the brotherhood too, right? Stay out of his bar. I'm serious. Fuck you! [door slams] [engine revving] Adios. [tires squealing] Armored car driver was right. Mm-hmm. It appears they've taken a class or two. [buzzes] Need to take it? [sighs] No. I'll call her back. She's just trying to plan Chloe's birthday party, and trying to figure out what we're gonna do with my son. Did you talk to him? [laughs] No. When was the last time you talked to a teenager? Think I'd have more luck breaking into a bank vault. Hey, whoa, whoa. Pause that for a second. You see that? Hmm. Someone has a conscience. [cook] Order up. Here you go. Do you need anything else? [patron] No, thank you. Okay. Just let me know. Hey. Talk to me. Let go of me. Look at me. Look at me. I'll tell you when it's time to let go. [scoffs] Okay. Let's go. [sighs] What do you keep coming over here for? I just wanted to see you. What do you want? Could you take a break? Maybe sit down. Have some coffee or something? What happened? Did he do that? Don't act like you care. I'm still your dad. You don't deserve that. You know, how about I tell you what I deserve. It's better than you and it's better than this. But it's all I've ever had. Eventually, you just get fucking used to it. You remind me of your mom. She died a long time ago. Just like you did. Order something or leave. I know I haven't been there, but I'm trying to change-- Order something or fucking leave. I'll take some coffee. [sighs] I don't wanna see you again. [sniffles] [Angela] Here we got our Spanish speaker. Trigger man. Crew leader. Mm-hmm. I like it. Crime lab came back on the robbery SUV. It's clean. No prints. No DNA. Yeah, you were right. Plates were decoys. And the wheel goes round. But we were able to trace the VIN number of the SUV back to an owner out of Dallas who reported it stolen two days ago. Okay. Well, let's subpoena the owner. Bring 'em in for questioning. See if they have any priors, anything that will link 'em to the other robberies. And, uh, let's check with local CIs, see if there's anything on the ground. Okay? Thank you, Roberts. Good job. Agent Solomon. The man, the myth, the legend. Oh, you're the only legend left here in this bureau, Dick. I was referring to your father, but that is a nice tie you got there. Thank you. Yeah, daughter picked it out. She has good taste. Yeah. Why are you referring to him for? You know, seeing you in your father's shoes right now, he'd have been proud. You know, some bitter lessons were learned at Waco. And, uh, he shouldn't have punished himself for other people's sins. Yeah. [sniffles, sighs] Two dollars for a bottle of water. Can you believe that? Highway robbery, if you ask me. So, did you really come all the way down here to be nostalgic? You know, Intelligence Division keeps me busy enough. Mmm. Takes a lot of work keeping things hush-hush, you know. Silence is the language of God. Indeed. [clears throat] So, why don't we just cut the shit, and tell me really why you're down here? I heard you took on that robbery crew. And there's a lot of publicity in it. Just wanna know if you have any leads. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, we're-- we're close actually. Yeah, uh-huh. Well, good to hear. Let me know if I can do anything to help at all. All right. Anything. You know, and obviously, Dick, if Intelligence has any information on the case that would be beneficial, you'll be sure to let me know as well, right? If I hear anything at all, I'll be sure to let you know. But can I offer some advice? Some, uh, advice your father didn't take. Yeah. And what advice would that be? It's okay if you don't win this one. [laughs] Well, that is terrible advice. I can understand why he didn't listen. The day ain't over yet. [printer whirring] Typically, you don't catch Texans trading in their spurs for skis. [chuckles] Look. I just want you to know that I appreciate what you did for my cousin while you were on the inside. And as we discussed before, all you need is 5% earnest money to show commitment. You got the money? Well... I'd say that's a whole lot more than 5%. How much is it? It's $250,000. I'd ask where it came from, but asking is for lawyers. And as long as I get my percentage, we got a deal. [keys tapping] There will be a $60,000 remaining balance. I just need you to sign below. Next to the X, pal. Good. I will draft a cashier's check. I'll overnight it to ensure they receive this in a timely manner. This check's gotta be received within five days of the binding-agreement date. It is a competitive market out there. You don't wanna waste a moment. You're all set. Pleasure doing business with you. [whistling] [Gabe] What do you want? The boy's lost to me. Did you know he took 'em? I did. I know what you did too. What do you know about me? It's all over the morning news. [coughs] Yeah, that went south. You should cut ties. Walk away. That's what you do. I'm not talking about me! [coughs] Yeah, you never did much talking back then. The past ain't never where you think you left it, boy. I've accepted what I've done. Have you? [coughing] [groans] You should talk to a doctor. [sighs] Ain't no doctor could cure me. [sniffs] I'm an old man. Old men die. [coughs] You're a reformed man. [laughs] Reformed. [chuckles] Mmm. [spits, groans] Is that what you call yourself? Doing what you think is right ain't the same as doing what's right. Yeah, there's never been anything right about this family. I guess being a criminal runs in ours. You know, it's a good thing your mother ain't around to see how we all turned out. You got a choice, boy. Look where mine led. [coughs] Rader won't stop. What makes you think I won't? You're like me. He knows it. You don't know me at all. You can't trust him. [music playing on speakers] What's up, Brandy? [Brandy] Hey, baby, how are ya? I'm good. You doing okay? I'm doing awesome. Good. You know where Mandy's at? Right upstairs waiting on you. Hey. My man. Hey, man. Doing good, bro-bro? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Good. Good to see you, man. Take it easy, all right? [patrons laughing, chattering] [music continues playing] Fuck off. [music continues playing] Hey. That was my last one. Where you been? Doing man shit. Mmm. "Man shit." Man shit. You know me. How you been? Better now that you're here. Yeah? [horn honks] Gonna get a new one once this is over? No. Smart folks keep the old ones running. Hey. Uh, do you care if I score some early cash? Yeah, I do. Before I leave. Yeah, I do. Actually, I mind. If you're not gonna do a fucking job, you're not getting paid, all right? Come on, dude. I already stocked the shelves and shit. Uh, I got everything done already. Come on. And now I need you to sweep the floor. You fucking kidding me? No, I'm not. Do I look like some little grunt bitch? Make one of the-- one of those little chickenshits do it. Come on, man. Remember, kid, I didn't fucking want you here. Your brother did. You know what? Fuck you, Dallas! Get control of your brother, Gabe. [brother] Bitch-ass motherfucker! [engine cranking] Engine is shot, man. Yeah. I'll take you home. [speaking Spanish] Gracias. No problem, brother. In the shop. Gabe gave me a ride. Oh. Hey, Gabe! [baby coos] [baby cries] Shh, shh, shh. Gracias. De nada. [Marcos in Spanish] Are you finished with your plate? Thank you. He does. Yeah. Yeah, he does. I plan to teach my son how to fish. Just like my father taught me. Did you do much fishing? Cerveza just for you. Thank you. [both speaking Spanish] Long time ago, I did. When I, uh... My mom used to leave my old man. Every couple of years, she'd always come back. One year, she took, uh, me and Wes up north, where she came from. Her brother had a boat. Wes and I spent the whole summer on the lake. It's the best memory of my life. You should go back someday. Okay. [Gabe in Spanish] How the fuck did you score that? [chuckles] I know you, motherfucker. See, man, um, when you got locked up, I went back to Mexico, lay low for a little bit. But when I met Camilla, I knew that she was the one. Mmm. Mmm. [sniffles] She got pregnant with my son. We decided to come back to America. Wanted to give him the best, you know? [sniffles] Anyways, man, how is Dawn? She ought to be in her 20s by now. She hates me. I earned it. I was pretty fucked up. [sniffles] I wasn't there for her when her mom died. I don't think she ever really had a chance. You know what I mean? Is there a way to turn that around? None that she'd like. I should've never brought you back into this shit. No, man. You know, Camilla wants to bring her family out from Mexico? She wants them to be involved in the children's life. [sighs] But it costs money to bring them over. And even more to keep 'em here. And this job and the shitty wages, you know that ain't enough. And being illegal... I-- I mean, listen, man. I really need this money. There's one last job. It's gotta be smooth. We can't fuck it up. I guess we play the game till we don't. This one we can't lose. Money's how we keep score, baby. [TV: theme music playing] This is KOTW Channel 5's Lori Lambert here with breaking news. Turn that up. Following the armed robbery that happened last week in broad daylight where three masked gunmen violently robbed an armored car at a city bank, [siren wailing in distance] the armed security guard, Philip Davis, pictured here, has died from his wounds. [rock music playing on speakers] It's not the first time some guy has eye-fucked me, okay? Mmm. Just go get us some beer. You mind not eye-fucking him back next time? [scoffs] [TV] ...by Lori Lambert. Hey, Monty. Two beers. We are live outside County Medical with breaking news following the armored car robbery that took place last week. Could you turn that up? Devastating news coming just hours after doctors were hopeful given several surgery attempts. But at this time, it is confirmed by medical staff that Philip Davis is pronounced dead. Fuck, fuck. Turn that shit off. Get me a bottle, would you? I said a fucking bottle. Wrong place, wrong time. [officers chattering] [phone rings] Wonder if these guys know just how much shit they're in. Capital murder? They're about to. Oh. Let's go. Is the FBI officially investigating Philip Davis's death? I'd say that's a fair assessment. [Lori] Do you care to comment? [Angela] Not right now. Thank you. [Lori] What would you like to say to those responsible? The past is about to catch up with you. [Lori] Well, there you have it. Straight from the FBI. They are officially investigating Philip Davis's death. What is your name, chula? Mandy. Mandy. Like candy. [patron] Are you sweet, Mandy? [Mandy] I can be. [patron] Mmm. What the fuck? Hey, cálmate. What the fuck you doing? Take it easy, amigo. Get your fucking hand out of my face. Cálmate. Why don't you just get us another round? Nobody knows what the fuck you're talking about. Well, I'm speaking English, so you'd better understand. Do I look like your bitch or something? Who the fuck are y'all? What the fuck is that you're compensating for? Hey. [sniffles] Hey! That's my girl. Well, she's everybody's girl. What'd you say? I said she's everybody's fucking girl. Yeah? Yeah. [speaking Spanish] What are you even saying, Tiger King? Fuck off! [patron] Listen to me. Go fucking fetch us our drinks, and get the fuck out of my face! I look like a fucking bitch right now? Huh? Yes, you do. Yes, you do. You're very tough. Go to the fucking bar. Get some fucking drinks. [groans] [Mandy] Wes! Back up! Back the fuck up! Bunch of little fucking bitches, huh, when someone pulls a gun? Get your fucking hands off her. Nah, I like this girl. Get your fucking hands off her! Fucking pussy-ass bitch! Wes, come on, babe. Let's get out of here. Come on. Yeah, come on, Wes. What you waiting for? Àndale. Do it. I dare you. Àndale, cabrón. Do it! Come on! Do it. What are you waiting for? Shoot him! Stop! Stop! This is my fucking bar! And, everybody, it's closed. Go. Move your ass! And you too, sweetheart. Get the fuck out of here. Now! Get your fucking hand off! Who the fuck gave you permission-- These pricks think they can fuck with me, man! Get the fuck out of here. Fuck 'em up. Back the fuck off. Listen, listen, listen, listen. Back up. Back up. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Seriously, listen. Put the gun down. It's down. All right? Move! Everybody, shut the fuck up! He didn't mean nothing. Get the fuck away. He fucking meant it. He fucking meant it. Listen to me. I tried to give him a chance. You understand? I tried to give him a chance. I said, "Cálmate, cabrón." I said, "Cálmate." You see this? Arañas latinos, motherfucker. [patron 2] That's right. Do you know what this shit fucking means? He disrespected me in front of my people, man. Oh, I'm so sorry about that, but you see this? And that's not from listening to gangster rap. Now, I'm asking you man-to-man. He's a fucking moron. I'm asking you, have a drink with me. All y'all, all right? Fucking waste our alcohol! Shut the fuck up, asshole. I'm talking to you. Look, I don't want your fucking drink, okay? I wanna fucking kill this motherfucker. Okay, okay, okay. I'm asking you to have a drink with me. I'll deal with him later. Please? All right? Simple. I don't want your fucking drink! You hear me? I want to fucking kill him! Whoa. Whoa! You hear me? I want his fucking blood! Okay, you can have his blood. Okay? Let me just get out of here. [gunshots] You see, motherfucker? You see, huh? You see, huh? When you pull out a fucking gun, you see what happens, huh? You see that? You see that, huh? You see? You see what the fuck happens? We're fucking killers now? This is not the way that was supposed to happen. The FBI, Gabe? This changes nothing. They don't know shit. We stick together. We finish this. Then we cut ties. And everybody gets what they want. I don't know, man. [cell phone buzzing] I gotta go. No, I got it. Here, thank you for the beer. [Wes] I do my thing. I do my dirty work. [Rader] So what can you tell me about? Can you tell me about the... [Wes] I did. He came in all guns blazing and shit. [Rader] I didn't-- I didn't come in guns blazing. [Wes] Was it a grand entrance? I gotta protect my snitch. [Rader] So you done fucked up. [Wes] That was hot. That was-- And you put a fucking revolver in my neck. [Rader] Oh, shit. The party killer's here. He's here. [laughs] Where'd the fuck you come from? Come on, man. Come on. Pick-- Come on. Take a seat right there and have a drink with us, right? [chair falls] Let's go. [Rader] What the fuck's wrong with you, man? I'm just damn proud of him. He's part of the brotherhood now. We got Ruben, Archangel Gabriel, and we got Superboy, and we got one motherfucking family, right, Pike? Get in the truck. You never did know how to have fun, did you? You should be like your little brother more, you know? He's a little bit more loose. You wanna know something? [chuckles] You used to be my hero when we were young. [Rader laughs] Get in the truck. Used to be the hero. Used to be. What the fuck is on your-- What's wrong with you? Because as I recall, you were the one who told me you were gonna take care of this shit. You know? You vouched for him. I'm just having a drink with him. And you know what? Your word, your precious word, don't mean shit to me no more. And you got nothing to say, do you? Your brother comes in here, pulls out a gun in my place and I got three fucking bodies to bury. Give me a fucking shovel. [laughs] Seriously, you're still a man of few words. "Give me a fucking shovel." Yeah. You know, seriously, you know what your fucking problem is? Is you actually think that your silence bought you favors with me. And you could not be so motherfucking wrong. Set up the bank meet. Stay the fuck away from my brother. Mmm. Sprout some wings, Archangel Gabriel. [coughing, retching] Get in the truck. Come on! [truck door slams] [engine starts] [sighs] I told you to stay the fuck away from Rader. Blah, blah. You think it's a fucking game? Fucking game. Do you think this is a game? And you love playing a game, bitch. Fucking little brother fucks shit up, big brother cleans it up. It's fucking merry-go-round shit that you get off on. Just drive. [inhales] [dogs barking] [engine off] That some more shit you stole from the old man? Shut your fucking mouth, man. You don't know what it's fucking like. Why don't you fucking tell me? [chuckles] You wanna know about Iraq? I don't give a fuck about Iraq. You wanna know about all the explosions and shit? I wanna know why you fucked up my job! Let me tell you something. Over there, I had my team, I had my unit, I had my brothers! And they had my fucking back! Every fucking day, I put on a uniform that showed me the respect I earned. You're not wearing that uniform anymore. No, I'm not! You know what I am doing? Sweeping some fucking shop! Is that the best I got to look forward to? Been home eight months! The best I got? Where the fuck are my cigarettes? You know, when we hit that armored car... most alive I have felt since coming home, can you believe that? Hmm? I just thought Wesley fucking Russell, you come back to your hometown where your daddy and your big fucking brother, the same brother who was your superhero when you were a little boy. You can be just like them. You can be a part of something! I came back thinking that I could-- I could belong to something too. Can't you see I'm trying to protect you? [chuckles] I don't need your fucking protection, motherfucker. [gun cocks] I think I can take care of myself, right? This shit gets in your blood. Takes over, makes you think you're invulnerable, but you're not. Neither am I. I'm trying to look out for you, man. You know what's really fucked up? Is whenever I shot that armored guard... I didn't feel a fucking thing, man. I'm no better than some fucking Hadji overseas. You need help. You know what would help me is the bank job that Rader mentioned. No. We're done. What are you talking about? I'm not fucking done. You gotta get clean, brother. And I can't save you. [sniffles] Get the fuck out of my house. The fuck out! [door closes] [static] [phone rings] We'll be in touch. Thank you. Just got off the phone with the owner of the stolen car. Did we clear him? Roberts is working on it. But get this: the owner discovered their keyless entry fob stopped working prior to the robbery. Okay. Is that a crime? No. But whoever had access to the car traded it out with a look-alike fob. Wouldn't raise questions with the owner. Well, did they mention who had access prior? Two weeks ago. Clemens Garage and Wrecker Service. There's something else. Crime lab found a tracking device underneath the steering column that survived the fire. You gotta be shitting me. Here's my theory: owner takes the car in for repair. Someone at the shop trades out the real fob with a fake one. Give me some of those duplicates. [Angela] Then one of them plants a tracking device in the car. They wait a few days. They track the vehicle with GPS. Almost there. Keep going, Gabe. Locate the vehicle, grab and go. [beeps] [locks click] [engine starts] Interesting skill set. Eliminate street thugs. And they'd have complete access to the vehicle at the shop. That's good. All right, um, let's-- let's question the other owners of stolen cars, okay? See if they visited the shop. See if they'll testify to it. Then I want any documentation they have, all right? Receipts, phony key fobs, phone calls, okay? They got a new carburetor, I want to know the part number. And let's expedite it, right? I want to be there the next time these assholes think they can take a score in my city. [Gabe] What's the take? There's $100,000 between two tellers at the front counter. There's an additional $100,000 right behind them at the drive-up windows. Every Wednesday, at 11:00 a.m. sharp, Wells Fargo delivers. Now they deliver cash for that week's payroll. They're also picking up any deposits that were put in the bank that week. But that's about $400,000 or $500,000. You mix that with the bank's money and you're leaving with at least half a million dollar take. How about security? No security. Wells Fargo guy will come in, he'll drop off, he'll pick up, and he's gone. What about cameras? Yeah, there's cameras. But I'll have them disabled for the day of for scheduled maintenance. So, what's your end? My end? It's 10%. Why does a bank manager rob his own bank? You trust the bank? Banks are like the streets, man. You keep your eyes open, you look both ways every time. You gotta be present on the day of. I'll be there. Devland... I pray to God that you completely understand what will happen if this comes back on us. Yeah, I know. Got the schematics? Yeah. Everything you need is right there. [Brett] Looks perfect, honey. Great job. [spouse] Thank you. Okay, go get Chloe. Okay, okay. [cell phone buzzes] Actually, one minute. I gotta take this. It's the office. Seriously? They know it's an important day. Right now? They wouldn't call me if they didn't need anything. One second. Hello? Better be good. [video game beeping] Hey. Grounded. Room. [video game stops] Now. Yeah, one minute. Let's go. Don't bug your sister. All right. Calling me at home on my daughter's birthday, it better be good. Check your email. Okay. Per your request, I set up a meet with the CI Remy. He wants to meet tonight. [chuckles] My man, Remy. Brett! [sighs] Yeah? One minute, honey. One minute, okay? Just... What am I looking at? Open the attachment. They're connected. All stolen vehicles visited the shop two weeks prior to the robbery. And we cleared the owners? Ran into a problem. What kind of problem? Two of the owners have priors. The others think we're implicating them. Refuse to testify. Well, all right. We can force a deposition. Either way, we know these guys are involved. We need to move on this. Listen, I want to know everything there is about this shop. I want to know everything there is about the people working there. If they got any records. See if they've ever employed felons before. And let's get surveillance on them, ASAP. All right? Right. Got it. Thank you. Okay. [party horn blows] [shutter clicks] [shutter clicks] [shutter clicks] Oh, yeah. Thanks. Is, um-- Is Dawnette working today? What happened? [beeping] Hey. [sighs] What can I get you? I-- I don't wanna talk to you right now. Do you feel like you can drink or eat anything? I don't need your help, okay? I made it this far without you, I'm-- I'm fine now. I'm just trying to help. It is my fault. You wouldn't understand. Help me understand. [knocking] [hospital workers chattering] How are you feeling, Ms. Russell? Like shit. How is she? Luckily, there's no broken bones. Just external abrasions. The good news is, as of right now, the fetus hasn't miscarried. But that could change anytime in the next 24 to 48 hours. There's just no way to know yet what might happen. It all depends on how your body responds. Okay. I'd, uh, like to keep you another day to run some more tests. In situations like this, the hospital provides a case manager that, uh, I'd like you to speak to. They'll be over soon. You should go. How far along are you? Two months. I already told Eddie about it and he flipped out. Um... He thought I was trying to trap him or trick him or something, I guess. I don't know. Maybe he's right. Was that Eddie at the diner? Yeah. You gonna say something? I'm leaving soon. I've got a place and I want more than anything for you to go with me. We can start over. [scoffs] I can't-- I can't just pick up and leave. I mean, it's not that easy for me. I don't have any money. I don't even know how I'm gonna pay for this. Let me worry about that. Would you just think about it? [sighs] I do need one thing from you. What? I need to know how to find Eddie. [knocking] [hammer cocks] Who is it? [Gabe] Me. Yeah. What do you want? I've got a problem. You asking me for help? Yeah. All right. Why didn't you fucking say so? All right, there's no back door and only one way in. You got a gun? [sniffles] I don't need one. [Eddie] Who the fuck is it? Jehovah's fucking Witness. Open the door. Wes. [Eddie groans] [screams] Jesus. [gunshot] [screams] Look at me, motherfucker. Pack your shit and get out of town. [gun cocks] I don't ever want you to talk to Dawn again. You hear me? Fuck you. [groaning] Hey. Hey! Let go of me! Come on. You got him. You got him. You got him. [coughs] Whoo! [laughs] Pretty boy got fucked up. [laughs] Hey. You're all over the place. Pull over. I'm fine. Pull the fuck over. Come on, slow down. Right there. [breathes heavily] Is my niece all right? Is she gonna be okay? Yeah. She's gonna be. I'm proud of you. Thanks for being there. [chuckles, sniffles] If you want in, you're in. You know what's funny is for the first time I think I want out of this place. By the looks of it, I think you do too. [sniffles] Let's go. [whirring] [Brett] Hey, Remy. [sighs] Well, what's up, Remy? [scoffs] Flat broke, man. Done run out of money again. Need a little help from my friends. I got you right here. What, are they trying to bring you back into the fold, huh? Oh, no, no, no, man. I told you, I'm through with that shit. I'm not going back. Well, but is that life through with you? Once you cross over, you never really come back. Quit fucking with me, super agent man. What the fuck you want? You heard about this crew that's been hitting these armored cars? Yeah, I heard about 'em. So? Well, I was kinda hoping a little birdie might have told you something. You know, it's a-- it's a big city, Remy, but it's a-- a small, organized crime underground. Yeah. I don't know who these motherfuckers are, man. But they're grabbing this shit quick. They jerking it off the streets. Shit, they're trying to beat your record. Ain't nobody gonna break my damn record, man. You know, I was trying to get out, man. Your line of business does have a shelf life, Remy. You want my opinion? Mm-hmm. These boys are gonna grab their money. They're gonna pay all their damn bills off and then they're gonna disappear, man. And when they gone, you ain't never gonna see 'em again. Plus, I'll tell you what's gonna happen, they're gonna stick their goddamn toes in some sand and laugh at your ass. So you don't recognize the MO? I don't recognize anything. Hmm. Why, 'cause you would have heard something by now? I swear to God, man. I think somebody's taking care of 'em, man. They'll take care of them as long as they want to. And then at some point, just like me, they get stuck. And when they stuck, they fucked. [sighs] You know, I just gave you a whole lot of money there, Remy. You haven't really told me shit. What the fuck you want? Well, who do you know that can move that quantity of money? I mean, besides a casino? There's only one motherfucker I can think of. Yeah, who's that? It's gotta be... goddamn Whitman Rader. [Dawn] So, what happens now? Come with me. Don't make promises you can't keep, okay? No, listen. Two days. That's all I need. Why two days? Because I've got some loose ends. Pack a bag. Just enough to get out of town. Meet me Wednesday night. We can leave from the diner. Can you do that? I won't let you down again. [Brett] Okay, what have we got? Wesley Allen Russell. Served eight years in the Army. Five in the Rangers. Ran him. No priors. Discharged after popping hot for cocaine after a two week recce in Iraq. Been employed at the shop ever since his return. And most recently became the proud owner of a new Roush Mustang. Guy thinks he's Magnum P.I. What I wanna know is, how does someone afford this car on minimum wage? [scoffs] Well, that's our position. Mm-hmm. He'd also have knowledge of weapons and tactics. The plot thickens. Mmm. Rader, what do we know about him? Owns a local dive outside of town. But get this, 25 years ago, Rader was running organized crime in Dallas County. Has a jacket as long as my arm. Goes off the map in about '04. Been clean ever since. And how does Wesley track with Rader? Word on the street is that he frequents his bar. Okay. Let's run him through Intelligence. See what they find out. What about this guy? [Angela] Big guy? Yeah. We're not sure yet. Okay. And? Shop foreman. And the Spanish guy? Too many to track. The shop employs mostly Spanish-speaking personnel. What's our move? Where is this Wesley Russell now? Surveillance tracked him to a dance club. What, strippers? Could be washing the money. Let's bring him in. I want to talk to him. [car alarm honking] [agent] Mr. Russell? FBI! Hands on the car! Hands on the fucking car! [groans] You got me. [alarm stops] [Brett] Has he said anything? Not a word. Ah, good. We'll let him sweat a little. Don't spook him. We don't need him to lawyer up. [sighs] Well, let's keep it simple then. Mr. Russell. Finally. Do you have a cigarette? [both] No. I'm Agent Jordan. This is Agent Solomon. That's fucking great. Am I in trouble or something? Well, not unless you're married. [chuckles] Got a little glitter on your shoulder there, bud. We just have a few questions for you. How long have you worked at Clemens? A few months, I guess. Yeah, give or take. What's the pay like there? [chuckles] Pay? Fucking pay. You know what? That's exactly what I was saying. Right, we were just talking about this. I mean, a Ranger, right? Sweeping floors at a garage. That's grunt work. It can't pay more than minimum wage. I ain't no fucking grunt. Okay, okay. I got a-- a kid, he's about to turn 16. My wife and I were about to get him a new ride. But, uh, you know, they're not cheap. Cars these days. And I noticed that you got a new car. So, I was just wondering, how does someone afford something like that on minimum wage? Hazard pay. From the shoot-'em-up army days. Army left you with hazard pay. Of course, they probably left you with some other things, right? Like, uh, weapons training? Hostage tactics? Maybe a chip on your shoulder? Where's this going? Look, Mr. Russell, explain to us-- How do you know Whitman Rader? You look like a nice lady. Is this one of those moments where I need a lawyer? [Brett] Well, I don't know. You know, it's not a bad idea, right? But, usually, in our line of work, if somebody needs a lawyer, uh, they have something to hide so... I don't know a fucking Whitman Rader. Okay. That's weird. That is weird though, because the word on the street is you frequent his bar quite a bit. Solomon. What? We're just talking. We're just talking here, all right? Just-- Just tell me how you know the guy. Yeah, and that's my cue. I'll take a-- a get-out-of-jail-free card. I'll take that-- that lawyer. Listen, I apologize. Shit. I'm sorry. We got off on the wrong foot here. How about this? I'll make you another deal. You tell me who this is and, uh, you're free to go. Moving, cover. Shot! [gunshots] Moving! Cover! Shot. Moving. Shot! Shot. Moving. Shot! [gunshot] Taught you fucks well. Get a few rounds in? No. What do you want? You look like shit. Yeah. I wanted to see you. We're meeting tomorrow night. [gunshots in distance] The fuck's wrong with you? We need to talk. [train whistle blows] [Gabe] So how'd they pick up on you? [Wes] The Roush. What'd you tell 'em? Nothing. No. No, look at me. What did you tell them? Nothing, man. I didn't tell them shit. Okay, I swear. [Marcos] Do they know about the bank? No, but they're-- they're curious about Rader. Wanna know how I figure into things. They know about me? Yeah, this F-- this FBI dude, Agent Solomon, he's smart. Do they know about me? He fucking knows about you! Okay? It's the FBI! [squawking] [Marcos] We play this game until we're done, Gabe. Gotta call it off. [train whistle blows] It's over, baby. Gabe, what are we gonna do? [whistles] [ratchet whirring] Damn. This is a nice shop. That's what dirty money gets you, huh? Huh. You must be, uh, Ruben Russell's son. Ran narcotics for, uh, Whitman Rader back in the '90s. Gabriel Russell, right? That's right. Who are you? Oh, sorry. Agent Solomon. You know, Gabriel, I had a really nice chat with your brother. Told me all about you. I mean, he only had nice things to say, of course. In fact, I think he looks up to you, if you ask me. Can I help you with something? Well, actually I was gonna see if-- You know, maybe if I showed you some photographs, you could answer some questions about 'em for me? I'm pretty busy. Well, just take a minute. Does that ring any bells? Oh, come on, buddy. That's not your barbecue? Oh, wait. Let me show you my favorite. This is great. You guys left that underneath that last car. [laughs] Thought you were smarter than that. No idea. Nothing, huh? Hmm. Well, that's all right. Federal agents are actually combing through your place right now as we speak. [shouts] FBI! FBI! Got a warrant. [agents shouting] Check those cabinets. Check that room. Turn this place upside down. Clear. You know, I read your file. You spent 16 years in prison because you wouldn't give up information about your criminal associates. Yeah, I don't betray my brothers. [chuckles] I love it, you guys and your brotherhood criminal bullshit. So many secrets. Speaking of brotherhood, though, what about the, uh-- the hit they put out on you? Man, I heard you put that guy in the hospital for a month. I mean, somebody put a green light on you, Gabriel. Somebody must have thought you were gonna talk. Is that why your father stopped working with Rader? Clear! Just-- Just answer me one thing. Just-- Just tell me why. Why, what? Why take down scores again for your old boss? You must be confused. I don't do that anymore. Time changes us. Well, that's where I think you're wrong. I think time, for people like you, is a weapon. So, I guess it's just a coincidence, huh, that every owner of the stolen vehicles visited this shop before the robberies. What a mystery. Mmm. The odds? [chuckles] [cell phone buzzes] You know, you and your crew, you killed that guard. For that, you're gonna burn. It's over for you, Gabriel. You know what's coming for you. Whatever's over for me came a long time ago. Glad we agree on something. Have a nice day. Hey, Wesley. Good to see you. [door hinge creaks] [clock ticking] [dispatcher] Eleven John Five, Eleven John Five, come in. [grunts] Hi, baby. [buzzing] Oh, shit. [groans] Hello? What? What happened? [Gabe] You have them? You're late. [sniffles] For good reason. I don't think anybody here can argue... $640,000 for one day's work. Not too bad, right? So, the accountant will be at the site, exchange the cash as soon as you arrive. We're ready. 10:55 sharp, we're at the bank. Park on the side, but come in strong through the front. Upon our entry, I separate the tellers from the alarms. Control the counters and the window. I'm gonna manage all the bank guests and communication devices. Tablets, cell phones, I got it. Once we're in, the world is ours. No panic buttons, no calls out. Get the bank's money, we wait for the armored car to arrive. When it does, guard walks in, we take him down. Frisked, zipped, nobody gets hurt. Nobody dies. And we're back here tomorrow morning, 10:00. You got it, bro. Gabe. Wait. Yeah, I got this, uh, sneaking suspicion that-- that you gotta tell me something, or you got something to say to me. So, just say it. I got nothing to say to you. You got nothing? Then I'll see you tomorrow. Good. ¿Va bien? Yeah, we stick with the plan. Let's go. What happened? We lost 'em. What does that mean? It means that somehow they evaded our surveillance. It's a rhetorical question, all right? I know what it means. What about, uh-- What about Wesley's car? Well, it's still parked downtown. He never came back for it. Okay. Well then, yeah, easy fix, right? We focus on his brother. Same with Gabriel. His truck is still at the garage. We didn't find anything at Gabriel's place. It was clean, Solomon. And we have cars outside their homes right now, correct? We do. They're not there. Right now? I mean, it's two common thugs, guys. I mean, what about their father? What about, uh, Ruben? Off the grid. No known address. All right, well... Fuck it. We'll contact Gabe's PO. We don't have a case yet, Solomon. If the PO catches wind that we're onto him, he's gonna arrest him for parole violation. [groans] He's gonna serve out his remaining sentence and walk. That what you want? Are we not the FBI? Figure it out. Come to make your peace? I have. I'm leaving. I'm taking Dawn with me. You know what to do? Yes, sir. Then let this be it for us. I'll hold a space for you, son. Let me call you back. This is the remaining balance on the property and some start-up cash. Can you put the deed in someone's else's name? I sure can. Can I trust you? Of course. Thank you. You're welcome, Gabe. Hey. Go ahead. Tell me something good. We got anything? No, we got nothing. [sighs] Can I help you? We're actually closed. Hello. Who killed my little brother? Oh. Well, information costs money. At least in my neck of the woods. Hmm. [water running] [flushes] [Mandy] Baby? [knocks] Yeah? [Mandy] I'm packed. Baby! No! [Mandy screams] [gunshot] [Wes groans] [gunshot] [gun clatters on ground] [Wes groaning] [sirens wailing in distance] [groans, breathing heavily] [breathing stops] [cell phone ringing] [sniffling] Yeah? How are you? Um, better. Everything's gonna be all right now. New beginnings. [sniffles] Are you there? [sighs] Uh, yeah. New beginnings. Be ready tonight. I will. Okay. [sniffles] [sniffles] [sniffles] Hey, Gabe. We can't wait for him, man. We gotta go. [car horn honks] [car doors slam] Where's Superboy? I don't know. You don't know? Do you? How the fuck would I know where he is? You're the one who vouched for him. Superboy probably skipped town. Mm-hmm. Which is probably for the best. So, it looks like you're gonna need a third man. Would you do me a favor? Go with him? No, fuck that. He's not going with us. Well, he knows the workups, and he can control the room better than even I can, all right? And by the way, you don't have any time left. You're out of it. So don't even think about disagreeing with me, all right? You make me proud, okay? [pats] I got you. Show him the ropes. Give me that fucking vest. All stations, can I get a sit rep? Baker 218 to Adam 12, we are on staging location. Parking lot secure. Stay off the radio. We're good. It's time. Everybody, stay calm and get down! Get down on your knees! Get down on your knees! Get on the ground! [Gabe] Hands up! Hands up! [robbers shouting] Hands on your head! [Marcos] Listen up. [Gabe] Everybody, be calm. Everybody, be calm. I said get the fuck down! Take out your cell phones. Put them on the ground! Do it! Quickly! Loose bills. Just leave the cash. No dye packs. Do you understand me? See this little boy out here? He wants to go home today. Your turn. Nice and easy. Get the fuck down! Hey! Get out here! On your knees. Who the fuck are you? I'm the bank manager. Bullshit! Don't you fucking lie to me. Where's Devland? [manager] I told you. Eyes forward. Everybody, out. Let's go. Let's go. [Gabe] On your knees. Everybody's doing great. Come on. Everybody, be calm. [Pike] Hands on your fucking heads! Right here. On your knees. [Pike] On your fucking knees. Faces down! I need you to give this to Agent Solomon. Do you understand me? What are you doing? Ho, ho! Oh! What the fuck is going on with you motherfuckers? What do you got going on? [Marcos] Hold on. [Gabe] Hey! Hey! What are you-- Look at me. Easy. Easy. Hold on, Pike. What the fuck do you think you're doing? Put the gun down. Fuck this. [cries] We don't do this. Uh-uh. This is my show. Easy, Pike. Right here. Hey. What're you doing, flanking me? Look at me! It ain't going down like that, son. Put it down. Get over here, motherfucker. Move! Over here! You get over here, motherfucker. Get the fuck o-- Uh-uh. You're not looking at him. I'm right here. I'm right fucking here! Uh-uh! [gunshots] [Marcos groans] Gabe! Gabe. Hey, it's all right. [groaning] We got this. Let's go. [groaning] Give me your keys! In the car! In the car! [breathes heavily] [Brett on radio] Where are these guys? We got fucked here, man. What do you wanna do? Get Rader on the phone. Find out where the fuck these guys are. Right now! Stay with me. Hey. Stay with me. The hospital's right here. They're gonna be looking for us there. [coughing] It doesn't matter. We play this game until we don't. Hey, we're past that. You hear me? It's gonna be okay. Tell Camilla... [coughs] ...and the kids that I love them. You're gonna tell 'em yourself. You had that baby boy, man. I don't want her to know. I don't want her to know. Hey. Hey. We got this. [groans] Breathe. Just breathe. Hey! Brother... [wheezing] Hey, hey. Marcos. Mar-- Marcos? Marcos! Hey! Hey! Hey. Hey. Fuck! Fuck! [flames ignite] [lock clicks] Gabriel? Look like you're coming out of the ether there. Where's Pike? You're the informant. Informant? What's this? Where's my brother? Brother? Karma's a motherfucking bitch, eh? [Rader groaning] You fucked me, didn't you? [laughs] I guess you won, huh? [chuckles] Man... I told you to stay away from my brother. No, wait, wait. Please, wait, wait. Please. [groans] [sirens wailing in distance] [shutter clicks] [manager] Are you Agent Solomon? [Brett] Yes. He told me to give this to you. Who did? The robber. [shutter clicks] [shutter clicks] Found the escape vehicle. Torched. And, Solomon, they said one of the robbers was inside. And somebody got to Rader. He was found shot dead in his bar 15 minutes ago. [sighs, clears throat] You sons of bitches got some explaining to do. Sheriff, what are you-- what are you talking about? Any reason why the FBI might be coordinating with local PD on a bank job behind my back? What bank? Frontier State Bank. Y'all got an agent on that deal. [door opens] What the hell is Albright doing here? Hey. Funny seeing you here. I've been meaning to come-- Oh! My man! Yo! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Here's some advice. Don't run an undercover bust during my fucking investigation! Prick! You all right? [train whistle blows] How you doing? [cashier] What can I get ya? On three out there. Can we add this to it? Fuck! [gun cocks] [tires squeal] [gunshot] Hey. We're closed. Um, no, I'm actually waiting on someone. There's no one here. Okay. I'm sorry. Good night. [train whistle blowing] [coughing, breathing heavily] [grunts] [door opens, closes]
