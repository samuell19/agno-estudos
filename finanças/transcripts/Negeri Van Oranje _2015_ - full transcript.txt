Lintang! Oh, my gosh. What took you so long? How was the fitting? - Done. - How are these? - Great. We'll try it together. - Okay. And the room. The decorations are ready. The flowers have been prepared everywhere. Take a look at it. See if anything's missing. Mom, just relax. I'm so nervous, you know? It's okay. Just relax, Mom. I'll go to my room now and see, okay? Go ahead to your room. The menu... This is great. This is finished. I'm getting married soon. They said that, before the wedding, we'll often be brought back to the many memories that brought us together with the person that we chose. The person that I chose is one of my four best friends. This is crazy. Geri, Wicak, Banjar and Daus. They're my four best friends. And Prague is only a small part of our story. That's the statue of King Wenceslas. He is known as the best king of Czechoslovakia, who was close to his people. Here in Wenceslas Square, there are two important spots. That's one of them. This is the second. Two students committed self-immolation in the year of 1999 as an act of protest against Russia's invasion of the Czech Republic. - This is their memorial. - They were still so young. One was 19, the other was 20 years old. They were younger than us. It's like the Semanggi tragedy in Jakarta. A solid country needs struggles and sacrifices. And it also needs the brave youth. Let's send them prayers, guys. - Let's leave him. - Hey! There's a lot of graffiti. You're looking at it so seriously. Forget it. Just think about it later when you clearly have a boyfriend. Hey, and who's thinking about that? You were looking at it so seriously. I'm just looking. Do you want to go to the John Lennon Wall? - Come on. - You want to, or keep looking at this? What are you talking about? AAGABAN. That's what we named ourselves. Why AAGABAN? It all started with the Netherlands. The country in which we studied for our master's degree. If Prague is like a dot, then the Netherlands is the long line that we walked on together. Guys. Do any of you regret coming to Prague? - Of course not, this is so cool! - No way. What about you, Cak? I never regret anything that's related to you guys. - Anything? - Anything. Whenever it is. - That's so sweet! - You're such a softie! Group hug! - Wasn't it fun to travel? - Very fun. I'm starting to not feel the existence of my fingers. Other things too. Yeah, me too. I was talking about feet. What did you think it was? Feet, Jar. Of course, feet. Lintang's asleep, isn't she? I think so. She went straight to her room, right? Let's take care of that matter too. What matter? The matter of Lintang. Listen. We're going home soon. We'll go our separate ways. We'll each be busy. So I think now is the right time to talk about Lintang. You mean who deserves to get Lintang? If you put it crudely. "Deserves." Okay. Sorry. If we're talking about who deserves her, only I can give her the best life. Lintang deserves more than just material things. From the beginning, I knew it would be like this. Whatever. Let's just have it like this. To make it fair, how about we make a bet? - Well? - Think before you speak. - That's fair. I agree. - It's fair, right? - Lintang as a bet? - It's better. - Think first. - What are you talking about? - That's the best way. - You guys are crazy. I came here to invite you guys to a meal. I heard everything. - Now I lost my appetite. - Nan. That's enough. Your responsible, Jar. Don't just blame me. You also agreed to have the bet! Think before you speak. - You're the same! - You're so stubborn! - This all started because of you! - Guys! If you want to fight, go do it later in the Netherlands. It's best we focus on finding Lintang now. Find her. Meet back here again in an hour. At that moment, I was angry and disappointed. Even though I feared something like this would happen in the Netherlands. But I didn't think I'd be so angry and disappointed. And that long line became tangled in my mind. THE NETHERLANDS, 2 YEARS BEFORE That's a quote that means, "What you see in fairy-tale books, you can see all of it in the Netherlands." And that's how I later chose this beautiful country as the place to pursue my master's degree. A Master of European Studies at Leiden University. A hand-rolled cigarette too? Oh, my gosh. I thought... You don't have a lighter either? Do you have one? You're an embarrassment to Indonesians. Do you need a lighter? You're a student too? You smoke hand-rolled cigarette too. Yeah. Because it's cheap. But it's rare for Indonesians to go to Amersfoort. It's not like I want to be stranded here. But the train suddenly stopped here and we were told to disembark. - So I did. - Same. Here. Thank you. - Sorry. I'm Daus. - Banjar. - Daus. - Wicak. - Sorry. Wicak. - Banjar. What? You guys just met? - We just did. - I see. - Do you want a clove cigarette? - I do. You and your strong lungs. It was offered to me. You're Indonesian too? - Take it. - Just one. Of course. Just take it. Hey, you took one too. You're the same as me. My friend brought me this. Sorry, I was being rude. - Yeah. - I'm Daus. - Geri. - This is Wicak. - Wicak. - Banjar. - Yeah. - Banjar. - Geri. - Wicak. Let's have coffee there. Yeah, it's expensive. Really? I like people like this. - Where are you studying? - The Hague. Where are you from? From Bandung. No trains are coming, miss. - There's a storm. - How are you so sure that I'm also Indonesian? What do you think? He talked to you in Indonesian and you answered him. You have a batik bag. He can guess, miss. Okay, miss. I think she likes me. What do you mean? She looked so grumpy. - Maybe she was offended. - Was she angry? Hi. What do you say we sit at the same table so we can chat? While you're waiting too. Sure. - Geri. - Lintang. Introductions later. I think I left my book outside. Wait. Hi. - Banjar. - Lintang. - Wicak. - Lintang. I usually use the Internet at campus. It's free. So when I get home, I can go straight to sleep. Tang. Who's that? That's my roommate. Her name's Arbenita. - Why, Daus? - She's pretty. You idiot. Could you even see her? No need to see. I can tell from her voice. That's a pretty voice. Voice-genic, Jar. You're so strange. - Hello! - Hi, Geri! Lintang, your name is Anandita Lintang Persada. How about I shorten your name? To just Nanda. It's better than me having to call you "Tang." Sure. Why is everyone quiet? I never remembered your full name. Oh, you guys. How about next week, we meet up and have some food at my apartment? - Who's in? - I want to! - Let's. - I'm coming! - Hey. - Hey, Tang. Come on, where are you going? No, I was waiting for you. I was going to go in, it's cold. It's really cold here! - Is it warm inside? - It's warm! - Come on, tell me. - No. I'm not a pervert. No. Why would I go inside this place? - Hey! - Hi! - Good morning. - Good morning. - All well? - All's well. No, it was just cold out here. I was going to go inside so I won't be cold. Let's go to Chinatown. - Come on. - Come on! Where's Banjar? - Jar! - See? He'll go in there. I can't believe him. We got the vegetables, the peanut sauce. Hey! Damn it! Why do you guys walk so fast? You're slow. - Where were you? - I was waiting for you at the other Asian supermarket. Why did you even go there? I'm not from here. What should I do? I only know that one. Right, don't be sad. We're going there soon. Huh? Damn you! If I knew that, I would have waited there! God loves patient people. - Guys! - It's raining. - We got everything? - Yes. But I should be in front. So noisy, Banjar. Are you sure this is your apartment? It's not my apartment, Jar. It's my dad's. It's the same thing. Can we see the beach? - Sure do. - Can we see bikinis? No bikinis in this wind. Come in. This is crazy! It's insanely cool! - Peace be upon you. - Hey! How are you? - Who is that? - Jeroen. Lintang. Wait a minute. Nan. Jeroen. - Jeroen? - Yeah. Are you finished? Hey, what's with her? Is everything set? Come meet my friends. - AAGABAN. - Hello. I want you to meet my boyfriend, Jeroen. - Nice to meet you. - Jeroen. - Wicak. - Jeroen. - Banjar. - Jeroen. Geri. Very nice. Thank you. - Let's eat. - Let's eat. I want to try Wicak's meatballs. Which balls? I was just trying to brighten the mood. Just kidding. So that it's not tense and serious like Lintang's boyfriend. Hey, he's right in front of you. He doesn't understand Indonesian. Relax. I understand. I thought Lintang was still single. Turns out she has this monkey. But it looks like there's a rift in their relationship. A lot of rifts. If there's just a little chance, you'll get her. - Okay. - He's going to leave, isn't he? Yeah, the monkey's going to leave. One monkey leaves, one King Kong comes. He's good. Making sudden maneuver to a rickshaw driver. Is Jeroen really busy? Something like that. Hey, he's touching her. Don't be sad. You have all of us here. Tang. Rather than you being annoyed, how about we... You idiot. You said you were my friend. Your mouth looks like a betta fish. - Karaoke time! - Wait. Are you serious? Come on, he's a legend. - Tang. Let's sing. - Tang. No. Oh, my. - Yes. - I'm just going to sit. - Hey! Stand. - Okay. I'll carry you everywhere... Haven't you taken a bath? - Yeah. - Hey. Ask anyone in the Netherlands. No one takes a morning bath. There is one. I do. You're the one who asked, not the one being asked. So, on your campus, there's a tradition of seniors picking up juniors? Yes. And taking them to places. Like a tour guide. And how many people are there? One. Okay. Because I thought there would be 30 people today and we would be like their tour guide. - Of course not. - Wicak. - Tyastanto Danutirta. - Wicak. This is my friend. - Lintang. - Okay. So, check-in starts in the afternoon. Let's go eat first in Amsterdam. Put your suitcase in the locker. - Where are the lockers? - Over there. Okay. Wicak, this is my suitcase. Please bring it. I became a porter. After you. Which one? This one? - Hey. - Daus. - Hey. Hello. - Daus. Let me introduce you. This is Tyas. Tyas, Daus. - Hello. - Hi. - Daus. - Wicak. Sorry I took so long. It's so cold. Sorry. By the way, did you bring the "oxygen"? Did you? I did bring it. But... But... Tang. "Oxygen." I can breathe now. Thank you, Tyas. Are cigarettes not sold in the Netherlands? Is it not allowed? No, Tyas. They sell it in them Netherlands. But they're just expensive. How much is it? One pack is five Euros. Five Euros? How come you can't afford that? Yeah, I'm really broke. So sometimes, if I don't have a cigarette or money, I would just burn trash. Burn trash and then I breathe it in. So that I get the essence of smoking. - That's so sad. - Yes, it is sad. Hey. By the way, for museums... Where are they? I want to see Da Vinci's works, Mona Lisa. Can I see your boarding pass? Maybe it's the wrong place. Yes, maybe you thought that you landed in France or Italy. Yeah. I plan to go to France too. Okay. Okay. It's fine. If you guys can't help me, that's fine. Listen. I have a lot of friends at the Indonesian Embassy. Right. Are you new in the Netherlands? - Yes. - You act like you know everything. - You're so rude. - Okay. - I don't need your help. - Yeah. - Thank you for the coffee too. - Yes, Tyas. Bye. - I'm speechless. - Where did he come from? Google Café? - Where did that guy go? - He really disappeared. Where did he go? - Let's go back there. Let's go. - That's it? Who will be it? - Right. Right, left, right. - Is it still far? Just believe me. Don't open your eyes before I give you a tap. Don't open your eyes. - Cak? - Yeah. I'm here. Open your eyes, Tang! Open them! Nothing. Daus! Yeah, sorry. Yeah. No. - Hey, no. - Why? - I want to take a photo of myself. - Fine. I won't be in it. - I already told you, kid. - What? Look at Daus. He's like a little kid. But most boys are like little kids, right? Except you. And Geri. Cak. Isn't that Geri? Geri! Ger! Hey! I have a meeting with my friend! Later, okay? Sorry! Bye! - Where are you going? - Careful. Come on. Let's eat. - What? - Kebab. Get one for me. You have two choices. Answer. You can't think. You can't protest. Just do it. If you protest, you have to dance. Would you rather starve on a mountain or starve on a remote island? - Island. - Mountain. Mountain. All right. Bad body odor or bad breath? - Come on. - Body odor. - Disgusting. - Body odor. Lintang has to dance. - Randy! - How are you? I don't know why. I think boys don't look good in orange. - How should it be then? - I think boys look good in blue. So cute! Cheers! Why did no one pay attention to Lintang's order? She ordered iced tea. Maybe the bartender got it wrong. Can't you tell iced tea from alcohol? What? Are we supposed to taste Lintang's drink first? No. You can tell from the smell and the color. - Show-off. - No. - We couldn't see it well. - Guys, it happened. Why are you still arguing? We're already near the house. Good morning, princess. Let's have breakfast. I'll wait downstairs, okay? Hi. Sit down. Wait. Come on. - Let's eat, Nan. - Thank you. - Do you want some cheese? - Sure. And why are these three quiet? I don't know. They had an argument last night because you were drunk. Seriously? Oh, my gosh. Guys. Guys, I'm sorry. If only you could see yourself last night. - Oh, my gosh. - You were bad. - A wreck. - Scary. - Insane. Insanely scary. - Really insanely scary. - Insanely scary. - Enough. - Super really insanely scary. - That's enough. Please. That's enough. Stop. - Let's eat. - Milk? She didn't want it. Sorry. At that moment, I didn't know. I didn't know at all that I couldn't keep treating them equally. That I would come to a point where I would have to choose. His full name is Irwansyah Iskandar. He's called Banjar because he's from Banjarmasin. He's a postgraduate business student at Rotterdam School of Management. Your job is to help Wahyu, from washing cooking utensils, cutleries, chopping the herbs, and schappen. - Damn it. - Damn you. Went all the way to the Netherlands to study. End up washing the dishes. You'll get used to it. He's just like that. But he works fast. I like that. - I'll leave you now. - Yes, ma'am. In Indonesia, he's used to a luxurious life. But in the Netherlands, he has to survive by working in an Indonesian restaurant. Hey! What are you doing taking pictures like a new kid? Hey! I'm not like a new kid. This is actually a new station. I'm looking for the angle for us to take a picture together. We rarely take pictures together. Geri always watches over you. I just got here. Taking pictures already? It's okay. It's fine. Just enjoy it. That's enough. We'll take pictures later. - Are you ready to see Rotterdam? - I'm ready! - Ready? - Ready! Go ahead. - Why are holding on to me? - Tang, Rotterdam is harsh. If you get kidnapped, they'll blame me. Hey! I'll catch you! All right. Seriously, Jar. It turns out this place is really cute. And I never thought people live in this place. Is this your first time coming here? Oh, my gosh. It turns out you're still a virgin. - Hey! - Asshole. Calm down! You're thinking bad. I meant a virgin to Rotterdam. You're so sensitive. My gosh. You're cute when you're angry. What am I supposed to do, Jar? This is my first time coming here. I didn't even know about that new station. You're really a serious case. But just relax. Let Mr. Banjar teach you. Relax. - No need to touch me. - This... There's some dirt here. See? All right. Let's go. Come on. - There. That's a place to eat. - Seriously? It's huge. There are all sorts of food. Dutch food, Turkish, any kind of food will definitely be here. - It's great. - We're going there? Yeah! Do you want to? Are you hungry? Come on. You want cupcakes? Mocha with espresso buttercream? Relax. Even if they don't have it, I'll tell them to make it now. Or I'll slap them. Hey, you're crazy. Acting all macho. I really am macho. Yeah, yeah. Don't just stare at it, Tang. Eat it. - Yeah. Be patient. - I'll eat it if you don't. Don't! I'm buying some strawberries. - Let's just sit here. - Sure. - Do you want this? - I was just about to ask you. Do you want this? Relax. This strawberry can be made with mocha with espresso buttercream flavor. Wow. Why "wow"? Every time I ask my mom to buy me, she would ask me, "Mocha what, Tang?" Or "Buttercream what, Tang?" Anyway. Here, try it. It tastes the greatest when using this. Try it. It's good, right? - Hey. Keep trying it. - It's weird. - Try it. - You try it. It's weird, isn't it? Yeah, they don't suit each other. In the movies, they would look so cool. You're cold, aren't you? Are you cold? Here. How did you know I was cold? Why gave him that much tip? - Just let it be, Jar. That's normal. - It's fine by me. I would be happy treating you. - Jar! - Hey! Wait here. - My wallet! - Hey! Jar! Hey! Hey! I don't want to fight you. Hey! Stop! Jar. Jar, are you okay? Tang. I'm so sorry, Tang. Because of me, everything is ruined. It's because of that damn pickpocket! Damn him! Jar, that's enough. All right? If it's about the papers, I can report it to the police. I can take care of it. Don't worry. No, the problem is that I wanted you to come to Rotterdam. You were supposed to be my guest and have fun and be happy. I would be your host. But I ruined it all. Jar, I really panicked seeing them gang up on you. - What if something happened to you? - It doesn't matter! What's matters is your wallet. Now you need your student ID and the papers. I feel bad about that! This is all because of me and... Jar. That's enough. All right? That's enough. Just relax, okay? You don't need to worry about it. I... I have no problem at all with this. That's enough. Now, let's just enjoy the view. Enjoy the night, okay? Daus. Firdaus Gojali Muthoyib bin Satiri is his full name. He's pure Betawi. Postgraduate student of human rights law at Utrecht University. Mr. Firdaus, your profession as public relations of Islamic Guidance in the Department of Religion is truly really crucial. That's why we strongly agree that the Department of Religion staff will be given a further understanding of international human rights law. He's the smartest of the AAGABAN kids. But his silliness sometimes covers his smartness. Wait here, okay? Wait here. Just for a bit. Tang! Welcome to Utrecht. Thank you. My favorite spot. Please sit. Daus. You're not stressed studying here? Honestly... No. I'm not stressed. Seriously, I'm not stressed. Why stressed about college? I'm not stressed. And I wouldn't be Daus if I didn't know the effective ways of how to study here. - Then you could share your tips. - I knew you would ask that. Okay, but don't tell anyone else. - Just one. - What is it? The way to successfully go to college here is studying. Hey, everyone knows that if you want to be smart, you have to study! If everyone knew that studying is the way to become smart, then they'd be like me. But they're not. But for you, my advice is that you shouldn't study too much. Why? Because if you're smart, then who's going to teach you? Then who am I going to teach? Banjar? Banjar is a savage. He can't be taught. Hey, how could you say that? Listen. If you look closely at a periodic table, there's man, Pithecanthropus erectus, Javanicus. And then there's Banjar at the back. Banjar doing this, freezing. - No. - It means that you'll teach me? - Yeah. - For free? For free? You have to pay. - I have to pay? - Yes. Make me tea or coffee. Something. All right. Tang. That's the Dom Tower. Back in the 1400s, this church was very large. But because of storms and a fire, only one tower is left. - Want to go there? - Let's go. All right. Come on. It's 110 meters high. And when I first came to Utrecht, my senior told me to climb the stairs. It's all stairs. They said that if you reach the top, all of your wishes will come true. What was your wish? Did it come true? It did. When I reached the top, I made a wish to come down. Because it was so high up, Tang! 110 meters! Check it out first. See? Do you still want to go up there? It's so high, Tang. Tang! Oh, no. You tripped, didn't you? Here. Be patient, okay? I'll do it slowly. Tang. I do things slowly. If I blow too hard, your skirt might fly all over. Yeah, I was just joking. Does it feel better? Just leave it open. It's all right. That's normal. We'll wash it with water later. Okay? How come you fell down? Come here. Slowly. Wicak Adi Gumelar. Also known as Wicak. He's from Banten. He's a postgraduate research student at Wageningen University. He's quiet, but he cares the most about a lot of things. Before coming to the Netherlands, he was an environmental activist that was targeted by illegal loggers. Cak! A true observer of what happens in his surroundings. Thank you so much, Cak. Hi. Something different about you today. - What? - Your jacket. It's cool, isn't it? It's pretty cool. Pretty cool. - Let's go there. - Sure. Are there a lot of Indonesians here? Not really. Thank you. I'm curious about this. You're the most quiet out of all of us. But you have so many friends. I mean, even before at Cut Throat, it's like everyone knew you. I have difficulty remembering people's names. I'm sure that even until now, you still don't remember my full name. When my dad met my mom for the second time at campus, he forgot her name. But he remembered one thing. This girl was the one who told him the direction of the campus' library at the beginning of college. So your mom and dad were on the same campus? So I never forget what people have done for me. That's my way of remembering people and appreciating them. The man who sells the spring rolls lent me a lighter when I was smoking in front of his place. That lady over there once gave me free cake. The woman watching over the shop told me that my money fell there. At Cut Throat, it was a coincidence. I had coffee there and they gave me a free haircut. Because they told me that my hair made no sense. - Seriously? For free? - Yeah. So you don't know their names at all? They also don't need to know my name. I remember them with just one event. That's what made my dad and mom marry in the end. Why are you smiling? Nothing. It's not often that I hear your voice. You don't usually hear my voice? It's not like that. I mean... Yeah, I understand. It's so cool, Cak. Like Bogor's Institute of Agriculture. So every department related to agriculture is here? Yes. Want to come inside? Welcome. I'd like to go to college here. Are you sure? There's no dance club. There's no mall. But there's Centrum. - Is everything okay? - Fine. Come on. Good? Cak. If you suddenly forgot my name... what would you call me? The girl that's willing to wake up early and take a bath to accompany me to Schiphol. Just that? One event is enough, Tang. Just one. Mutton stew. Is it good? It's so good. I really miss Indonesian cuisine. It turns out you're good at cooking, Cak. I lost to you. When I lived in and out of forests, I'd usually cook for myself. One of the ways to stay alive. What is it? It's nothing. - You've been making me... - Making you what? Making me happy. Your pleasure is mine. Garibaldi Utama Anugraha Atmadja. Also known as Geri. He's from Bandung. A postgraduate business student at The Hague University. Ever since I met him, Geri already attracted my attention with his sweet personality and fun presence. But if I want to talk about him, I need to start with the end of my relationship with Jeroen. Come. Lintang. Finally. I tried calling you many times, but it didn't work. Are you sick? Nan, do you remember? That time when you looked for mortar and pestle to make chili sauce? Turns out that I manage to get it here. Hey. Nan. What's wrong? - Is something wrong? - I can't talk about it now. Everything's going to be okay, Nanda. Geri has always been special to me. He always appears when I need to feel safe and comfortable. Hey! What? Cak? - Jar? - You look really different today. - Are you guys... - Right, her hair is different. You went crazy with your hair today. - You guys came here... - Geri said to come here at 10:00. What is it? - Hey! - See? Hey! How are you? Hey! You look so beautiful! You keep speaking Dutch, like a Dutchman. Ger, I brought food just for the two of us. No problem. They brought food too. - Jar. You brought fried rice, right? - Ready! What is it? - Daus? - Daus is over there! Let's go! Tang. You're not cold wearing just that? Come on. He's really there, right? - How are you? - All right, man. - Where's your car? - Here. - No, seriously. Where's your car? - This is it. See? I opened it. I get why I can't bring mine. - You wanted to drive this? - Yeah. The problem is, will we fit? Come on, Tang. Please sit. - I call shotgun. - You guys in the back. Jar, come on! Hey, man! Why did you bring a car like this? You know that there are many people. - What's with you? - Here! - Take my picture. - Your picture? Oh, my gosh. Your face is blurry. What am I supposed to take a picture of? - That's enough. What is it? - That hurts! - Look, an ant bit him. - What? - He got bitten? - Jar! Look at your face! - Are there any good ones? - Yes. Hey, let's take a picture! Cak, how about your picture? There's the place. Jar. It fell! My hat fell! Guys, here's the fried rice. I just looked at our photos. Your expression is priceless! - Let me see. - "It hurts!" - How about I post it? - You're crazy! - Post it. - You're crazy. - Come on! Let's eat! - I'm going to upload it. - Hey. - Upload it. Just upload it. - Did you? - Why are you like this, Jar? Wait. What should the title be? - "A Red Butt." - You... - That's enough. - Why are you like this to me, Jar? It's all right. Just enjoy it. Take it slow, man. Yeah? - I broke up with Jeroen. - Who's that? - What? - The foreigner. - We ate together. - Why did you break up? He met his ex. Oh, my gosh. And then? And that he still loves his ex? No. He met his ex. Her name's Mieke. And it turns out he has a child with her. Wait, what? Before he was with you, or after... Oh, my God. I mean, it did break my heart. But yesterday, with him, I felt... I was happy to have a boyfriend. Someone to care for me. If it's about love, I'm not sure. But honestly I was really sad yesterday. And... Hey. Don't be sad. You're not alone. We're here. Tang. It's all right. You don't need to be sad. Now you're single and ready to mingle, right? Hey. So the question is, who do you love? Listen. Tang. Just say it, Tang. No need to hide it anymore. Look in each of their eyes and say, "Daus." Cak, hit his butt. Hit it. - Don't look at his eyes. - That's enough. - We have to support her. - Come on. Group hug. I love you guys. Daus, you stink! None of them answered when I asked who sent the flowers. But I'm sure it was Geri. Hello? Yes, Professor? Yes. Thank you so much, sir. Yeah. Thank you. That day, my thesis got the green light. I passed. It was such a happy day. For me, for my parents, and hopefully for my best friends. You passed? Congratulations. I'm happy too. Thank God! I'm so happy to hear that! Of course I'll come! Yeah! Congratulations! Okay! Bye! Where is the best chocolate shop in Utrecht? Oh, yeah! Come. That is here. I'm proud of you. I will come to your diploma ceremony. Anandita Lintang Persada. You're amazing. - I had my graduation first! - Congratulations. Tang. Congratulations. The best chocolate in Utrecht. Thank you, Daus. I also have something for you. Thank you. My wallet! Jar? I told you that I would take care of it! - How did you do it? - Congratulations. I'm Banjar, after all. Nan. Congratulations. I'm proud of you. Thank you so much. That's a long hug. That's from all of us. Guys, how about we eat now? - Do you agree? - Let's go. - On me. - It's hard for me to refuse if you said "on me." - Come on. - Come on. Tang, where's a good restaurant? - Bye. - Thank you. You're welcome. You are looking good. Thank you. How sweet of you. Nanda. Nan. Nanda! Nanda. Nanda. Nan. Nan. Why couldn't you just be honest with me? Be honest that I'm gay? I feel so dumb. You know that, Ger? - All this time, I thought that you... - I'm sorry... if you misread my caring for you. But it wasn't my intention. Then what? You care about me the most. You understand me the most. For what? To cover up who you really are? I really do care about you! I really do love you! But without realizing it, you toyed with my feelings. I never meant to toy with your feelings. At all. I wish I could be honest with you. I can be honest with myself. Do you think that it's easy? You know how people look at someone like me. Do you think I'm happy having to go through all this? It's tiring, Nan. You have to pretend in front of everyone because you're afraid of not being accepted. To everyone. To your family. To your friends. Even to your own best friends. Ger. We're your best friends. You don't need to hide anything from us. I want to apologize to you all. Because I could only be honest now. But honestly, I feel more relieved now. I have no problem with that, bro. There's nothing wrong with your life choices. Thank you. Ger. I support you, bro! You're terrible. But it's all right. Take it easy, bro. Thank you, Daus. And then? Let's drink! Wait. This is... I'm just curious. So that it's clear. I'm just curious. You're not going to... This... I mean... You don't have feelings, right? For me? I mean... Just so that it's clear. Since we're friends. No. I mean I'm just worried because we're friends and I... - Oh, my gosh. - I can guarantee that. Okay. Sorry, if that's the case. You're not my type at all. See, Daus? He likes the absolutely handsome ones. Not the absolutely noisy ones like you. - Wait, I'm not done talking... - Yeah, you're not my type. What do you mean, I'm not your type? Wait, you have to explain what you mean! Cheers! Is it because I've gotten fatter? Cheers! - To a new chapter. - Cheers to our friendship. Great. By the way, guys. I think we need a vacation. If you want to go on a vacation, that doesn't cost a lot, what if we go to Eastern Europe? Uzbekistan. - What's in Uzbekistan? - What? - I meant Prague. - Prague? - Prague! - Prague! - I agree! - Prague! AAGABAN! Congratulations! Tang. Let's go back. Stop being angry. It's cold here. I thought you were all different. I thought you were my best friends. It's not like that. It's not what you think. Or that all this time, I was just something to prove yourselves? - We're not that terrible. - Then what's the reason? My reason? I love you. - I also love you all. - More than a best friend. Maybe my presence has always been overshadowed by Geri. So you never realized it. Do you remember when you asked who sent you flowers? I sent them. Because I didn't want you to be sad. Because I care about you. But I was afraid to say it. I was afraid you would avoid me. But I don't want to hide my feelings anymore. Do you remember back in Wageningen? The jacket that you said was pretty cool? I borrowed it from a friend. Cak. I'm sorry. Maybe I was never good at winning your heart. Maybe I was never good at putting words together. Maybe my presence has always been overshadowed by Geri, Banjar, Daus. Even I don't know what I'm saying now. And maybe I look stupid to you now. But it's better that I look stupid now than regret it later, because I never told you this. I love you. You don't need to answer now. Even St. John's placard only grants the wish after six months. I love you... Anandita Lintang Persada. Let's go back. It's cold. Just like what Wicak said. Sometimes in life, to decide something big... You just need one event, Tang. Just one. ...you just need one event. The event in Prague brought us to this day. No more anger, disappointment and sadness. We're all ready to draw a new line. Three, two, one! AAGABAN! And the long line full of colors that we walked on became eternal, wrapped in a beautiful orange color.
