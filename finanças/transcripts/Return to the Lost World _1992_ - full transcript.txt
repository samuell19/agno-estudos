[exciting music] [footsteps] [birds calling] [rustling] [growling] [birds chirping] [growling] [non-english speech] [non-english speech] Imana, [non-english speech] [non-english speech] [non-english speech] [growl] [laughs] (QUIETLY) [non-english speech] [non-english speech] [rustling] What the hell are you doing? Who are you? What are you doing with my little bird, huh? Speak, you fool. He doesn't understand you, Dr. Heymans. [sighs] Well, Gomez, make him understand. I will try. [non-english speech] [non-english speech] He says he is the chief of his tribe. He and his people live here. He wants to know what you are doing in his land. You see this, my good friend? This is a lease, you understand, signed by the Belgian Governor General, allowing me to carry out scientific research on your little plateau. [non-english speech] [non-english speech] He says he is the chief here. He wants to know who gave you this right. Here is the lease, signed by the Belgium Governor General, granting me that right to do anything on your little plateau. Gomez, bring him. [non-english speech] CHIEF: [non-english speech] [rumbling] Everything is ready, Doctor. Great. I'm coming, huh? Bring him. Get ready for some fireworks, Chief, huh? [laughs] Everything is ready, sir. We'll see. [non-english speech] [growling] We have no time. Carry on. [growling] [non-english speech] Get on with it! [growling] [explosion] [weak growling] [yelling] [laughing] Amazing. [laughing] [laughing] Quite the king, huh? [groans] Ah! [yelling] [gunshots] [groans] [non-english speech] He says you have angered his gods and therefore you are cursed. You must leave this land or you will die. Take him and throw him off of the cliff. Now. You heard Dr. Heymans. There are no gods. There is no curse. Only death. Move! What are you waiting for? Get back to work! Do you think I pay you to stand around and pick your noses? These barracks must be finished by the end of the week. [weak growling] IMANA: [non-english speech] [growling] [non-english speech] [growling] [non-english speech] [hisses] [non-english speech] [yelling] TRIBESWOMAN: [non-english speech] TRIBESMAN: [non-english speech] [non-english chatter] [birds calling] [splashing] [non-english chatter] TRIBESWOMAN: [non-english speech] WOMAN: Malu, what is it? MALU: They threw him off the cliffs. WOMAN: Bring him into my quarters. [non-english chatter] Gently. Gently. Bring him quickly. I need boiling water. [coughing] He should be fine. He needs rest and care, a lot of it. Have you heard of the British government giving permission to anyone to explore the Lost World? No, but there have been others-- Belgians, Portuguese. Is he saying they spoke English? Yes. His people believe that if any member of their tribe leaves their land, they'll be cursed forever. Something terrible must have happened for him to leave. I can telegraph the British District Commissioner at Nairobi. I doubt that that will help much. Kate, I think that it's time we call our friends. Professor Challenger and the others? They vowed that they would return if we ever needed them. They have to come now. [dramatic music] MAN (VOICEOVER): Dateline-- July, 1914. The Khyber Pass. The borderline between our Indian empire and savage Afghanistan. A patrol from His Majesty's Indian army waits to ambush a gang of Afghani smugglers. Their illegal spoils of tiger skins and ivory threaten the very survival of India's precious remaining wildlife. SOLDIER: Fire! [gunshots] [groan] SOLDIER: Fire! MAN: Jenny! [grunts] Jenny Nielson, you are not a well person. Dammit, Edward, my camera and my plate are completely ruined! My apologies. Next time we'll save the camera first. [non-english chatter] It would have made a nice picture. Oh! [donkey braying] We're due for a vacation after this. We've been going nonstop for the last-- I don't remember how long. I was thinking of going south to Salam. There's wildlife there that's never been photographed. More work? Don't you ever think about having fun? The French Riviera. Breaking the bank at Monte Carlo. Or even a long weekend in Kashmir. You don't know what you're missing. Was that an offer, Mr. Malone? SOLDIER: Edward Malone? MALONE: Yes. SOLDIER: Telegram from your newspaper. MALONE: Way out here? JENNY: That's pretty good service. MALONE: It's a message from Kate Crenshaw, Kalimi. JENNY: Really? MALONE: And Malu. JENNY: Hm. MALONE: "Palala inured. Reports of oil drilling in Lost World. Dinosaurs in danger." Come on. We can be in Dar Salam within a few weeks. What about the others? We can wire Challenger and Professor Summerlee from Bombay. They won't come, Jenny, unless we go get them. Summerlee and Challenger were feuding again. Then you and I will go alone. Remember what Chief Palala said. We're stronger when we six are all together. We have to bring them with us. This is beautiful. What's Summerlee doing in this joint? That rich patron of his, The Countess-something, the one who funded the Summerlee Institute, insisted in her will that the museum be set up on her estate. And there it is. Well, lucky old Summerlee. You don't suppose he and the Countess were, uh-- Summerlee? No, I suppose not. [both chuckle] Very nice. JENNY: Good morning. MALONE: Summerlee's done all right for himself. JENNY: However he did it. MALONE: [laughs loudly] Wait here. Spotless. Like the man himself. BUTLER: Professor Summerlee. Now, remember, get him to agree first. Then we can mention Challenge-- Whoops. Miss Nielson. Mr. Malone. Professor. You look well. I'm gratified you finally found your way to my humble institute. I did send you both invitations to the opening last spring. [stammering] Let me show you around. Right. Follow me. Come. Sorry about the opening but we just couldn't make it last spring. We were in America covering the elections. Jenny did a photo portrait of President Wilson. Oh, so you two are, um-- Partners. Hm. Peculiar things, American elections. Then, I have something here that you should see. This should be delightfully familiar to you. Mississippi bedrock. You said you'd just been to America. Scientific joke? [laughter] JENNY: Professor. Oh, it's so good to see you haven't changed. Me, change. Why? I'm afraid this isn't just a social visit, Professor. We received this in the Khyber Pass of all places, and it's urgent. SUMMERLEE: Oh. We hoped you would join us. My duties here do keep me rather busy. I don't know. But you took the vow to return, just like the rest of us. Think about it, Professor. All of those amazing prehistoric animals, the last of their kind, they're in great danger. We need you, Professor. We need someone with your unique genius to lead this expedition. You would be lost without me. I accept. Good for you, Professor. There is, however, one condition. I will not go anywhere if that's scientific heathen is involved. I assume you mean Professor-- I will not have that name mentioned in this place of science. Challenger! So you two are not speaking? Not speaking? I've not spoken that man's name since he took it upon himself to discredit my theory on the origin of the Orinoco River! Well, he disproved you before, Professor. I mean, there did turn out to be a lost world. Purist fluke. Complete and utter accident. I was totally justified in disbelieving him. How can any genuine scientist respect the theories of such a loud-mouthed, over-stuffed, feeble-witted, insincere lout? CHALLENGER: Summerlee? That whining scoundrel? That-- that eternal bore? That-- that miserable excuse for a scientist? Of course I understand the seriousness of the matter, but I cannot, under any circumstances, see myself leading an expedition to Africa that includes that-- that-- that irritating charlatan! Professor, I've finished the graph. Oh. Do you remember Jim? Mr. Malone. MALONE: Jim, my good man. How have you been? Very well. Thank you. JIM: It's so good to see you. Jim. I'd have thought Professor Challenger would have scared you off by now. What, me? Never. This is good work. I have to say, I could scarcely do a thing without the help of my young assistant here. Oh, not so young anymore. Is it another adventure? Not a happy one, I'm afraid. The Lost World is in danger. You can count me in. CHALLENGER: Oh, not so quick, Jim. I will not, under any circumstances, go to Africa if that miserable man sets foot south of the Sahara! Actually, Professor Summerlee's much too busy with his institute to go along, so it's just the four of us. And Malu. We could hardly budge Summerlee an inch from that old museum of his. Oh, I'm not surprised. The fellow never did have any spirit. We leave tomorrow morning. Excellent. I am with you. But, Professor, we do have to take certain precautions. Your departure must remain an absolute secret. George Edward Challenger's departure a secret? You remember the hoopla the last time we left for Africa. We can't afford to be held up like that this time. Every hour counts. We have to make sure the newspapers hear nothing about this expedition. You'd be mobbed by the press. Every journalist in the world would want an interview, and that would cause serious delays. He's quite right, of course. Everything I do is of international interest. JENNY: Of course. What cautions do you suggest we take? Leave that to me and Jim. CHALLENGER: Quite right. Let's not burden my mind with trivialities. My mistress, science, calls. We must not unsheathe the great sword of intellect to cut butter! Ha-ha! [inaudible] Pack my bags. A great story of intellect. [inaudible] [ship horn] [laughter] Ah, Jim. Now we're all here. I'm glad you had the good sense to leave the employment of that lunatic. JIM: Yes. How do you occupy yourself nowadays? Oh, this and that, Professor. This and that. By the way, Professor, I'm thinking of doing a piece on the origins of the Orinoco River. Mr. Malone, I had no idea you were interested. Well, as you know, I've just completed an extensive study on the subject, and I think I can give you a comprehensive if not definitive account on the origins of the Orinoco. Great. I believe I'll go see how the cook's making out with lunch. I'll join you. All right. I'll fill you in with the details when you get back. MALONE: Don't be long. So the nexus of my treatise-- or perhaps opus would be a better term-- is that the thrusting forth of the Andean Range is the result of the mounting of one tectonic plate over another. Which one is it? I'm not sure. [knocking] Sir? Sir? [groaning] I think this is it. You do it. [banging] What the hell kept you so long? There can't possibly be journalists aboard this ship! Now I know what it is like to be confined within the intellects of a common Englishman. Stifling. I'm sorry, Professor. It's just that we-- SUMMERLEE: I must consult my notes before we go any further with our conversation. JIM: Oh, no. MALONE: Yes. SUMMERLEE: I don't want to disappoint my son. MALONE: Of course not, but I-- SUMMERLEE: It won't take a moment. I know exactly where my notes are. They're right here in my trunk. Challenger. Summerlee. Oh. Of all the underhanded treachery. Treason comes naturally to you, Summerlee. Naturally? No more words, Challenger. A words, Summerlee. Do you beg for mercy? You'll be begging for mercy. Surrender is a word not in my vocabulary! I have a bigger vocabulary than yours in at least five languages. So en garde, Professor Crapule. [yells] Gentlemen. Gentlemen, please. In the name of science. JENNY: We don't have time for all of this. JIM: Stop it! What are you doing? Our friends are in trouble and here you are fighting. JENNY: Jim's right. Don't you remember the vow we all took? Not just one of us, but the whole group. JIM: Remember your toast, Professor Challenger? "To six intrepid explorers in the name of science and adventure." You drank to it too, Professor Summerlee. CHALLENGER: [groans] I am prepared to overlook my differences with Professor Summerlee for the duration of this expedition. After all, this is a serious matter that we are about. The fate of the last prehistoric animals on Earth may depend on us. I'm afraid I must agree with you, Challenger, much as I loathe the thought. Good. Now, shake hands. Shake hands. Good. Now we're really off on our expedition. [indistinct chatter] Any trouble? No trouble at all. Don't lag behind, or you will get more of the same. HEYMANS: Gomez? I see you have some helpers, huh? GOMEZ: Yes, Doctor. They are members of the tribe of the former chief. Free labor. [laughs] Splendid. Good Thank you, Dr. Heymans. - Sit, Gomez. - Thank you. Ah. HEYMANS: Orange? Yes. Sante. Salud. HEYMANS: Gomez, I need somebody I can trust. You have a certain way, a certain sophistication. These others are just dogs, cheap morons. Useful but unable to think for themselves. Dumb animals. Not smart like Gomez. HEYMANS: You see the way it is then, huh? Mm. Gomez, there is a lot of money to be made here, and I think you should get more than the rest. And you will, as long as you continue to help me, huh? GOMEZ: Thank you. Thank you, Doctor. HEYMANS: There! Get out of the way! Forget it. Forget it! Move the pipe! If we don't clear the pipe, there would be a blowback and we'd all be blown to bits! All together, up! Watch out! Move! Move, you fool! Put it down! Move! Get this out of here! Get a move on! You fools! Get in there! Get a move on! You imbeciles! It's overheating! Get a move on! Hurry! Get a move on! [squeaking] Can we help him now? As you wish. Gomez! GOMEZ: Yes, Dr. Heymans. Now, Gomez, I want you to get rid of him. Get rid of him? Yes. I don't care how you do it. Tell him you're flying him out for medical care and then just have him disappear. [dramatic music] [non-english singing] [suspenseful music] They are here. [cheering] [car horn honking] MALU: Hello, Edward. I've thought about you so much since you left. And we of you. [non-english speech] He's waited here every day for you. CHALLENGER: Greetings, Palala. [non-english speech] MALU: He says you must hurry. He can feel the fear of his people. Their world is in great danger. Tell the chief we will do everything we can to save his people. We'll leave at daybreak. Is that a command or a suggestion, Summerlee? It's a logical conclusion. It's now 4:30 in the afternoon. Well, I see nothing's changed. Nope. CHALLENGER: Come on. Come on. MALONE: Try to get along. KATE: Bye now. SUMMERLEE: Goodbye. Goodbye. JIM: Goodbye, Kate. CHALLENGER: Don't splash me, Summerlee. JENNY: If all goes well, we should be back in a couple of months. KATE: I hope so. JENNY: Me too. KATE: God go with you. Do you think you brought enough supplies this time, Challenger? One must be prepared for any contingency, Summerlee. I hope we have some life preservers. We're going to need them when these craft begin to flounder. [coughing] MALONE: Do you think it's wise to bring Palala? I'd like to see you try to talk him out of it. - I don't speak his language. - I do. Let me tell you, it doesn't help much. [laughs] [splashing] Oh, stop! Remember that little pterodactyl we brought back to London? Percival? JIM: Yeah, little Percy. I wonder if he ever made it back here. It's a long way from the London Zoo to the Lost World. JENNY: Well, I hope he did. Otherwise, he's bound to be pretty lonely. [elephants trumpeting] CHALLENGER: All right. We'll stop here for a little rest if that's all right with you, Summerlee. SUMMERLEE: Yes. Thank you for asking. CHALLENGER: Is it my imagination or is this river getting longer? SUMMERLEE: No, it's not getting longer. We're just getting older. MALONE: Doesn't it feel good to be back here? [sighs] Why is the water green? Vegetable matter washed downstream. The river is teeming with vitamins. Yes. I wager we could market this water in London for its restorative powers. It would sell even better in America. The fountain of youth. JIM: Let's see if it makes me any younger! [splash] JENNY: Jim! [laughter] MALONE: What a boy. JIM: I think I feel older. [inaudible] got some sun? [splashing] Malu, what's that over there? JIM: The water's lovely. Bala. Bala fish. Jim, get out! MALONE: What are bala fish? SUMMERLEE: They're like piranha, only much worse! [splash] JENNY: Swim! Swim, swim, Jim! MALONE: Swim to me, Jim! Come on, swim! JENNY: Oh, please hurry! Swim quickly. CHALLENGER: Swim faster! Go! Go! Go! SUMMERLEE: Hurry, Jim! They're coming! CHALLENGER: Get him in the boat! Quick! [inaudible] My god, there are hundreds of them! [splashing] Summerlee, your paddle. This is amazing. It's almost Mesozoic. Oh, poppycock. That's a perfect [inaudible]. Give it to me. I'm a zoologist. I'm the geologist. CHALLENGER: Come on, give it to me! SUMMERLEE: It's mine! CHALLENGER: Oh, please. I said please. Give it to me. You're breaking my thumb! Ow! [splash] Do you see what you've done now, you blithering idiot? [panting] Thanks for the rescue, Jenny. Well, I owed you one, remember? The Khyber Pass. [elephant trumpets] All this baggage is only going to slow us down, Challenger. I keep telling you, Summerlee, there is nothing here that will not be required on the voyage. Shh. Thank you. [cawing] Well, "not on the voyage." Continue. SUMMERLEE: Um-- MALONE: [whistling] Enjoying the view? [clears throat] I'm just-- [fire crackling] MALU: [non-english speech] CHALLENGER: Good night, Jim. JIM: Good night. CHALLENGER: Good night, you all. MALONE: Good night, Professor. MALU: [non-english speech] CHALLENGER: How about you, Summerlee? SUMMERLEE: Good night, Challenger. Would you like to take a walk, Edward? Can you take photographs in this light? No. I just want to go for a walk. Miss Nielson, to the best of this reporter's knowledge, this is the first time in living memory that you've ever done anything just for the hell of it. Any comment for my readers? None that you can print. [chuckles] Mm, maybe I do get a little obsessed sometimes. Do I? We've been working together for quite a while now, haven't we, Edward? Couldn't ask for a better partner. I'm actually glad you said that. I want to be a great photographer. It's just that I worry sometimes that I might be missing out on other things. I mean, since I'm always concentrating on getting that perfect picture, I just wonder if I'm not missing out on other things that are right in front of me. - Oh, yeah? What sort of things? MALU: [non-english speech] Oh, I bet you don't miss too much. Maybe not. I think I'll skip that walk. Good night, Edward. [hissing] [indistinct speech] HEYMANS: We are having trouble then, Gomez? No. They are just afraid we will anger their gods. I'm sure you can find a way to deal with their silly situation. No problem. [non-english speech] [inaudible] HEYMANS: We're making good progress, Gomez. According to my calculations, we should be striking oil very soon. WORKER: Achtung! Watch out, dinosaur! HEYMANS: Keep it away from the rig. I don't want any [inaudible]. Come get your weapons! Get a move on! [indistinct chatter] [growl] [gunshots] [growl] [gunshots] [groaning] [thud] You see? It can be killed, huh? [laughs] MAN: Challenger, this time we know the way. Make big change in men's attitude. CHALLENGER: In all our attitudes. MALONE: Is it ever hot. Can you do those? You're lucky, Malu. You're the only one dressed for this weather. [rip] MALU: [non-english speech] MALONE: Are you hurt? MALU: I'm all right. [chuckles] Well, here, take my shirt. Oh, it's easily fixed. SUMMERLEE: Mr. Malone, what are you doing? Uh-- nothing. Just admiring the good Lord's handiwork. We'll make a naturalist out of you yet, hm? [monkey screeching] [animal calls] [grinding] WORKER: Dinosaur! [gunshots] [inaudible] Stone, get back here! [roaring] He doesn't like the rig. [gunshots] The pipe! He's going for the cooling system! [hissing] Run! It's going to blow! Heymans, look there. Look! The dinosaur has struck oil for us! [men yelling] That's not oil. That's hot volcanic ash! Get me out of here, Gomez! Run! Run! [explosions] WORKER: [screaming] [explosions] [rumbling] [explosion] [men yelling] [explosion] There goes our last link to the outside world. [non-english speech] [fire crackling] [rumbling] I never thought I'd see this place again. Neither did I, Jim. Professor, what's that? That's smoke. And I'll wager it's volcanic in origin. Isn't that a premature conclusion from a distant glimpse of smoke? I agree that all the facts are not in, Summerlee, but that smoke comes from a volcano. I will stake my reputation as a scientist upon it. Can't we make the stakes a bit higher, Challenger? Perhaps something of worth? Let's go find out for ourselves. [rumbling] CHALLENGER: No, no, no, don't put that down. We're going to need all of that. And be careful with it. Some of it's a little fragile. Come on. [non-english conversation] [hissing] MALU: [non-english speech] Ah. Yes. North. Well, what now, Doctor? Oui. You got us into this mess. Now, how are you going to get us out of this hellhole? I understand my responsibility to you men. I think you know that, don't you, Sam, huh? He'll shoot you, Sam. Sure. Sure I do, Doctor. It's just-- Don't worry, Sam. I've got a plan. Men, those tribesmen must have a camp near here, and I'm sure they know a way off this plateau. And I'm sure we can convince them to tell us how. Gomez, come here. Come. We go and scout for that camp, huh? [laughs] And I'm sure we can persuade them to tell us how to get out of here. [non-english speech] [growl] HEYMANS: That looks like the place. GOMEZ: They seem to have a deadly form of defense-- those boulders. Ah, oui, but we have guns, Monsieur Gomez, huh? [both laugh] Doctor. [growl] [non-english speech] [clicking] [gasps] HEYMANS: I think we found our ticket off this plateau. IMANA: [non-english speech] [growling] GOMEZ: What about that thing? HEYMANS: Leave it to die. IMANA: [non-english speech] [growling] [yelling] [rumbling] MAN: [non-english speech] IMANA: [muffled cries] HEYMANS: Hello, up there! I have a friend of yours down here with me. TRIBESPEOPLE: [non-english chatter] IMANA: [non-english speech] HEYMANS: Do you understand? They don't know what to do. Come. GOMEZ: What about the other men? Forget them. IMANA: [muffled speech] [dramatic music] [roar] [rumbling] Professor, what's that sound? Unless I'm mistaken, and you know that's highly unlikely, that is the sound of the volcano at work. Oh, really, Challenger. Not your volcano theory again. Summerlee, have you ever heard a volcano while standing in a tunnel by its core? No, I have not. Well, there you are then. Have you? I just did, and you would too if you'd keep your ears open. How can you put up with that man? I-- I have to find a way off this damn plateau, Gomez. [non-english speech] [non-english speech] Gomez, what is happening here? They say we have brought death to their world and we must be in league with the evil ones. The evil ones? The man-eating dinosaurs. These people believe they are evil gods. They say they cannot help us or the gods will bring more death. You are afraid of your gods? Hm. It's me you should be afraid of. Gomez, tell them I will kill the girl and each of them, one after the other, until they tell us how to get off this damn plateau. [non-english speech] You don't believe me, huh? Gomez, kill her. Kill her! [gunshot] TRIBESPEOPLE: [non-english chatter] CHALLENGER: Imana, here! [gunshot] MALONE: I'll take that gun. You-- you-- you've got this all wrong. I can explain. TRIBESMAN: Palala. TRIBESPEOPLE: Palala. I know what you think, but it's not true, huh? My name is Bertram Heymans. I'm just a poor scientist trying to get away from this plateau. [non-english speech] Oh, no, no, no, no. You see, I have here a lease. [non-english speech] It's signed by the Belgium Governor General. [yelling] It gives me the right [inaudible] experiment on this plateau! Fire your gun into the air. [gunshot] That's enough! There will be no lynch mob here. Tie him up. Get up. HEYMANS: Thank you. Thank you, sir. You will not regret this. [non-english singing] [drumming] [rumbling] MALONE: Jenny, you have got to see this. It's amazing how beautiful it all is. JENNY: Deadly, but beautiful. [bubbling] [camera clicks] Mm-hm. Professor Summerlee, would you come here? SUMMERLEE: Yes, Jim. JIM: Professor Challenger. CHALLENGER: Hm? I think you'd like to take a look at this mural. CHALLENGER: Why? JIM: There have been some additions since we were here last. SUMMERLEE: Good Lord. They've been adding to the paintings. I do believe that's supposed to be us. Good heavens, yes. Our last trip. Look. Malu, Malone, saving us from the skeleton people. And that's Jenny. And that's me. Yes. And this must be Summerlee feeding the medicinal herbs to the sick dinosaurs. SUMMERLEE: And I dare say that that is you, Challenger. [laughter] It's amazing how we've become part of their mythology. MALU: We're more than that now. We're a part of their religion. We're gods. What, all of us? Even Summerlee? [laughs] MALU: Especially Summerlee. He saved the dinosaurs. Well, I-- I suppose it does make some kind of sense. The scientific tools we use to help these people must seem miraculous to them. CHALLENGER: Just a minute, Malu. What exactly do they expect of us as gods? MALU: They expect us to destroy the volcano and restore peace to their land. I'm telling the truth, Mr. Malone. I just had a talk with Heymans. I don't know. He seems to be full of remorse over the damage he's caused. He says Gomez threw Palala off the cliff. It was no accident that he was up here. I'm afraid there are always going to be men like Heymans. People who just don't understand that a place like the Lost World is unique and should be left undisturbed. MALONE: Yeah. Well, what do we do? SUMMERLEE: It's no good racking our brains over it now. A good night's sleep should give us a few answers. Yes, he's quite right, of course. Good night to you all. JIM: Good night. CHALLENGER: Good night, Summerlee. MALU: Good night. HEYMANS: Are you going to leave me tied up like this all night? [distant eruptions] JIM: I can't understand you, Imana. [non-english speech] All right. I can help you. I'm coming. [distant eruptions] Where are we going, Imana? [animals calling] [thud] [roar] [growling] [hissing] [growl] Oh. So that's what you meant. IMANA: [non-english speech] [growl] [growling] [distant eruptions] Wait. Wait. Stop. He's so heavy. [growling] [chomping] We better hurry. Here. [growling] (QUIETLY) Stop. Stop. Get down. There. Stay here. SAM: Don't we have enough work, Cole? [gasps] SAM: He was in the jungle spying on us. WORKER 2: But who is he? Where did he come from? Where did you come from? Did Heymans send you? Are you with Heymans? Where is Heymans? He will cost us. Where is Heymans? [hissing] [imitates bird call] This boy knows where Heymans is. Heymans knows the way down. He is not talking. We can fix that. [sizzling] Where is Heymans? [imitates bird call] [growling] [non-english speech] JENNY: There they are! PALALA: Imana! [non-english speech] [non-english speech] PALALA: Imana, [non-english speech] Mr. Malone, would you please help me? He's terribly heavy. IMANA: [non-english speech] [non-english speech] IMANA: [non-english speech] PALALA: [non-english speech] Damn that man and his oil drilling. Doesn't he know the value of life? If this little thing dies, if they all die, there will be no more dinosaurs. No more Lost World. That Belgian really knows his geology. This raises the common oil well fire to a whole new level. CHALLENGER: Summerlee, by George you've got it. An oil well fire. What is a volcano? It's a fire from the ground. And the solution must be the same for both of them. Well, you've lost me, Professor. No, no, no, no. How does-- how does and oil man put out an oil fire? He caps it. He uses a high explosive to-- to-- to choke the fire. And that's what we must do. [distant eruptions] Only on a grander scale. I don't know, Professor. That would take a fair amount of explosives and we don't have any. How wrong you are, Mr. Malone. Jim, will you do the honors? JIM: Yes, sir. SUMMERLEE: What's going on, Challenger? CHALLENGER: Summerlee, you will recall on many occasions I have said, one must be prepared. SUMMERLEE: Dynamite? Oh, hardly, Summerlee. Hardly. No, this is the product of years of experimentation by Jim and myself. It's a new form of explosive, probably 10 times more powerful than dynamite. I have named it after myself, aptly-- Challengite. You mean to tell me that we have been dragging high explosives along with us the entire time? Well, I was hoping I could make further tests. You see, they're still a little unstable. [gasps] It's finally happened, Challenger. You've gone stark staring mad. Summerlee? You propose to use your untested explosive to put out a volcano? It won't work. I'm the geologist, remember? Such an explosion would only make the eruption worse. And you speak from experience, of course. I don't have to try leaping off a cliff to see if I could fly. I don't have to shoot myself in the head to see if I'm impervious to bullets. You'll kill us all. Then what do you suggest? We must leave the plateau. We must evacuate Chief Palala and his people. MALU: I don't think they'd like that too much. This is their home. It's their only hope for survival. No. This is their only hope. It's our only hope. Now, I have studied those tunnels on our journeys through them, and I'm sure that I can find a tunnel there that will take us close to the volcanic core. We will put the Challengite in that tunnel, we will explode it, and we will kill the volcano. I'm going to make a quick scout of the tunnel. No! Be careful! CHALLENGER: Who's coming with me? [sighs] Nobody? Very well. I shall go by myself. [distant eruptions] [fire crackling] [sighs] Mad, am I? The greatest scientific mind of his generation. They'll revile the prophets-- Galileo, Darwin, Challenger. What the devil? [bubbling] Good heavens. I must be getting close to the core. No. Too hot that way. Let's try this one. [non-english speech] We don't have much time. Malu, how do you get through to these people that the volcano could erupt at any moment; in the next few minutes. I'll tell them again, but they don't want to leave their home. [non-english speech] I will listen. [non-english speech] What do you think, Jenny? Has Challenger finally lost his mind? PALALA: [non-english speech] JENNY: What's he saying, Malu? Chief Palala and his people have decided they will not leave. But it's the only way if they want to live. They say they don't want to live, not if their world is dead. [distant eruptions] [non-english chatter] [dramatic music] Close. Ah! Very close. [inaudible] distribute the weight evenly. Damnation. Backwards or forwards? Backwards, I think. [fire crackling] Don't burn. Oh. [yells] Steady now, old man. Steady. Steady. You can do it. You can do this. You can do this. Oh. Damn hot. [grunting] Rats! Oh. God, I have to lose some weight. [grunting] Ah! Oh, this blasted bridge. MALONE: Challenger! Challenger, where are you? CHALLENGER: Malone, the bridge. Now, give me a hand. [grunting] Thank you, Malone. I-- I do believe you saved my life. We've got to get out of here. Oh, my leg. [inaudible] [grunting] It was as close as I could get to the core. You do believe it will work, don't you? I'm trying to, Professor. [crash] CHALLENGER: [yells] [whoosh] [coughing] That tunnel is the only way off the plateau? The only one. So, even if we could fix the bridge, we're trapped? [rumbling] Unless my explosive will clear it. It looks like we better go ahead with your plan after all. Damn right, we are. [non-english chatter] Are you two all right? Well, no broken bones. Hmm. Jim, find all the Challengite you can and find an extra long fuse wire. You're not really listening to him, are you? It's our only option now, Summerlee. The tunnel's blocked by an avalanche and the Challenger's way or none at all. It won't work! Damn it, Summerlee, listen to me! Our sole hope is that the explosion does work. Now, like it or not, it's our last chance. [dramatic music] CHALLENGER: Man the livestock. Pen them in, quickly. Come on, hurry up. Hurry up. Jim, keep that line moving. Malone. What is it, Professor? Be sure they have plenty of torches. We've got to get as close as we can to the volcanic core. Malu. Malu, what's going on here? He thinks all this is his fault, partly because of his leaving the Lost World. He may be right. It's been one disaster after another. Palala, listen to me. Listen to me. Now, you can sit here and watch your world come to an end or you can try to save it. Now, that's all we can do-- try. What do you say that we give this curse of yours a run for its money. Eh? I do believe he understood you, Challenger. Hope is a universal language, Summerlee. Come on now! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Good. Good. Good. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. [growling] Oh. Oh, he's scared. So am I, Imana. So am I. CHALLENGER: Very good. Excellent. Excellent work. Hey you there. What do you want? Uh-- I want to help. You've done enough already, thank you. Look, I'm going to die like everyone else here. I just want to do my part. Please. This is all my fault. Please. Give me a chance to redeem myself, huh? Oh, merci. Thank you. You would not regret this. I'm sure I won't regret it. If you make one wrong move, I'll cut your throat. [rumbling] [growling] CHALLENGER: Right. These four men, Jim, Malone, and myself will attempt to place the explosive by the volcanic core. The rest of you take cover just in case. SUMMERLEE: Good luck, Challenger. Good to see you entering the spirit of things, Summerlee. I still think you're mad. I just hope you're mad and right. MALONE: And so do I. Lead on, Malone. JENNY: Good luck, Edward. Be careful. Don't worry. We'll be back soon, one way or the other. [somber music] [non-english chatter] Come on. [grunting] Come on. [hissing] [squawking] Keep it close together. Come on. [bubbling] We're getting closer. Not much farther. [rumbling] Hold it. MALONE: [inaudible] the Challengite or we'll all be blown to bits. [yelling] Oh, God. You love him, don't you? Yes, I do. You must tell him. He needs to be told. I will. [rumbling] [gasps] If I ever have the chance. [coughing] Is everyone all right? MALONE: I think so. CHALLENGER: [inaudible] [non-english speech] Come on. JIM: It's blocked. CHALLENGER: We can go no further. Here. Put them against this wall. Jim, the cord. MALONE: I'll take that. [rumbling] [yelling] Go on. Get back. Jim, [inaudible]. JIM: We sure are, sir. CHALLENGER: Come on, then. Good man. Good man. [inaudible] Something must have happened. [tribespeople sobbing] [coughing] Trouble? Maybe. I couldn't get the explosive as close to the volcanic core as I would have wanted. Oh, Edward. Thank God. What is all this? (QUIETLY) I'll tell you later, when we're safe. This is as far as she goes, Professor. Right. Is it long enough to go to the other side of that rock? I think so. All right. Set it up there then. I hope to heaven this works, Summerlee. All right, everybody. It's time to think about-- [explosion] All right, everybody. Take cover. Palala, get your people to safety now. [non-english speech] [gunshots] CHALLENGER: Come on, take cover. Do you like that, eh, Jim? Those are my men. What are you doing? We want out of this damn place! Either you show us the way out, or we kill every last one of you! There's one way out of here, and it's our only chance. Shut up! [gunshot] Now, I saw you going into that cave. We know there must be a tunnel. They're telling the truth. You have to trust them or we all die here. I've had enough of your damn lies, Heymans! [gunshots] They've lost their minds. Give me your weapon. CHALLENGER: Summerlee, we must detonate that Challengite. Every second we delay, it reduces our chances. Oh, damn this leg. SUMMERLEE: Wish me luck. [gunfire] [yelling] [grunts] SUMMERLEE: Cover me! [gunfire] [inaudible] Take cover. Get ready. Come on, Summerlee. Come on. Nothing. Damn! Bloody hell! Summerlee, what's the matter? The battery's holding a charge. What now? There must be a break in the wire. Damnation. I'll fix it. CHALLENGER: Jim, no! MALONE: Jimmy! CHALLENGER: Give him cover, [inaudible].. Come here. HEYMANS: They need help, huh? Heymans! [gunfire] You can do it, Jim. You can do it. [rumbling] [yelling] Thanks. Look! There. Light. The last [inaudible] must have cleared a path. We're home free, boy, huh? But we'll never have time to get the others. Forget the others. This is our chance to leave. Put that down. This is our chance, Jim. This is suicide! Give me that fuse! Look, Jim, we could walk right out of here and back to London. You would like that, huh, Jim? Huh? [rumbling] Back home in Brussels I'm rich. You could be rich too, huh? What do you say, huh? Jim, huh? I say this. [buzz] [explosions] [coughing] [cheering] [non-english speech] [cheers and whistles] Summerlee. Summerlee! You are a damn brave man, Summerlee. And sometimes are very blind one. I was wrong, Challenger. Your plan worked. You stopped the volcano. Yes. It has worked. [non-english speech] But at what cost? IMANA: [non-english speech] Oh, Jim. IMANA: [non-english speech] CHALLENGER: Look, everybody! JENNY: Jim. CHALLENGER: Jim! IMANA: [non-english speech] CHALLENGER: Jim! [cheering] Jim. Jimmy! [cheers and whistles] This is nice. Where's your camera, Jenny? You're missing a hell of a picture. Oh. Forget the camera. [squawking] What's that? Look, they survived! I don't believe it. JIM: Is it Percy? It is! It's Percy! Percy, is that you? I think it is Percy. He's flown all the way from London. [growling] He's come home. MALU: Percival. JIM: Percy, you made it! Percy! Professor, once again I have misjudged your deductive skills. I apologize. Oh, no apology needed, my dear fellow. Somehow our own personal differences seem trivial in the circumstances. I agree. Until today, I had no idea of the role of intuition in scientific thinking. Your use of Challengite to seal the volcano was nothing short of inspiration. Oh, my dear fellow. That is so kind of you. And it was only made possible by-- by your own personal display of courage and a fair measure of good luck. Summerlee, it may interest you to know that I have decided to destroy the formula for Challengite. Why? It worked. The world does not need a more powerful explosive. But without it, all of this would have been lost forever. Thank God we saved it. CHALLENGER: Yes, we saved it. But for how long? [squawking] [clapping and singing] [exciting music]
