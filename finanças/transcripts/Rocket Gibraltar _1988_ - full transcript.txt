In fact, this is true, Last week I caught a cold, And I got some of that new stuff That opens up your nasal passages And while they were open, I caught another cold. So, luck hasn't changed. Is that your baby sister? Who else? Female Warren Beatty. (Dwayne) takes a licking but keeps on ticking. "I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. Demille." [laughs] Oh, aggie. Hi, daddy. How you feeling? I feel great. Just seeing you makes me feel good. Yeah? (crow) ok. Good enough. Good work, guys. Kind of stupid, isn't it? I thought you were supposed to fill this up yesterday.

See, now you got the kids into it. [woman laughing] Hi. How's it going? (Rose) hi. What's with crow? Oh, don't you read the papers? Yes, but the ones I read don't have comics.

Ok, but we do have some alternatives. We could fire him. We could hire a coach or... Grandpa! Grandpa! Hi, aunt Ruby. How are you, gramps? Hi, gramps. (girl) hi, aunt Ruby. Was that you, Kane, behind the wheel of that van? Yeah, Billi let me drive from the gas station. Well, I'll be darned. Guys, come on up! Yeah, come on up! Go ahead. Go ahead. Where's Rolo? In the van, on the phone. Hello, doc. [Levi laughs] I see you're teaching the young pup some new tricks, eh? Well, as we used to say in good old London town, If you can't teach an old dog new tricks, get a new one. How's the writing coming? Very nicely, thank you. I've been hired to do a screenplay. Who said nepotism was dead? It's not for his studio. It's--it's a cross between in the heat of the night And Beverly Hills cop. You know, high-concept with top spin. Eddie Murphy plays an agent who stumbles Onto a murder case in south Africa. I'm quite sure it will be a big Summer hit. Black comedy, huh? Sounds like a great picture. Where's everyone? In the kitchen. Come on. You want anything, dad? No, I'm all right. We'll see you later. You bet. Hey, hey, hey, it's me, Rolo Rockwell! He's matured quite a bit, don't you think? You wouldn't believe the traffic on the l.I.E. It was murder! It's a good thing you were on the phone all the time. Happy birthday, dad. A bit overdressed, aren't you, son? Well, I came right from work, dad. How is the movie business? Is this a trick question? Don't ask. Dad, I need your opinion. Writers don't have opinions. Only words. Producers have opinions. Thanks, dad. You look great, dad. You really do. [kids chattering] (Dawn) cy, what are you doing? He's getting really old. (Ruby) who's getting old? Dad. Come off it. Dad's always getting old. Ever since I've known him, he's been getting old. And he's known him all his life. The older I get, the more I'm fascinated by the aging process. How mother nature plays her little tricks. That's why I have so many babies. Oh, it's the old anti-nature routine, huh? I got to make a phone call. I think crow's on the phone. Where is that guy? I got my own phone anyway. Hey, crow. (crow) how can they renegotiate the contract? What clause? I never read that thing. I've been the number-one starter for 3 years now. I'm at the father-in-law's. [slams down phone] You ok? Baseball: It's a kid's game. One day I'll have to retire. Hey, everybody's got to grow up sometime. Nobody likes getting old. It's easy for you to say. You can be an old producer. You just can't be an old baseball player. I got a busload of lawyers. You want a lawyer? No, I got a lawyer. I got an agent, got an accountant, got a business manager. What I don't got is a curveball. This is when I was 8. I miss the city. The pollution, The crime, The noise. I'm an emotional wreck. I really am.

You know it. Oh, Stavros, why isn't the script ready? That's no excuse, the writer doesn't speak English! I mean, you can't speak English. Hold on a minute, I got to change ears. (radio commentator) Anderson looks. He sets and delivers, and it's low and inside. That will load them up. And I think we may have seen the last of Anderson. And, yes, that's gonna be it. Here comes Davis out of the dugout. He's heading for the mound and he's... (Kane) where should we go now? (Flora) how about the beach? (all) yeah! (Emily) but we don't have our bathing suits. (Dawn) we'll go swimming this afternoon. Hey, blue, come on! [horn honks] Did you bring the list? Get some brussels sprouts while you're at it. Brussels sprouts! Lately, I've been depressed. I don't know if I can do standup comedy anymore, Levi. I keep hiding behind famous people because it's easier. [sighs] I used to be funny. I mean, I really was. How can a person wake up one day, and suddenly not be funny? I don't know. Something's wrong with me. Maybe I need vitamins. You ever get like this, Levi? No. My life is 90 percent memory. Past. That's all there is. I'm just happy I'm regular. Got any jokes you want to try on me? Yeah. All right, maybe I'm old fashioned, But I don't approve of belly dancers. I mean, why can't they dance on the floor, like everybody else? Got any more? Can I get this? (Ruby) oh, aggie, is that necessary? (Rose) I want these. Are you taking those, too? Oh, absolutely. You guys, hurry up! [all chattering] Do you have enough money? I paid. Blue! Blue, come on! If I have to come and get you, you're going to be really sorry. Blue, come on.

What is that on top of it, Rolo? It looks like dill. You like vegetable? Pay attention to Dwayne. He's got a new joke he wants to tell us. It's about belly dancers. You're on, Dwayne. Dad, you're, like, putting me on the spot here. They're going to put tomatoes on yo-yos, so they can hit me twice. [phone rings] I got it. Oh, no, not the phone. Yeah, yeah, Rockwell. The date of the week. Oh, come on. Is your wife there? (Kane) who's that? Probably Aunt Aggie's new B.F. Yeah, that makes sense. You think she's sexy? Who, Aunt Agnes? Uh-huh. I wouldn't throw her out of bed. Yeah, 'cause you got the top bunk. Isn't my family great, Vinnie? It's Tony. I'm sorry. My name's Tony. I knew it ended with a "nie." (Tony) they're, um, they're wonderful. (aggie) so, what's your family like, Tony? They're just regular people. Like us? Yeah. Yeah. Except, you know, different. Like, they're crazy. Like, they're crazy in a different way, you know. They talk different. [phone rings] You want to go into the barn and fool around? What about your father? It's ok. He's sittin' right over here. It's all right. Come on! (Rolo) you're his agent, why don't you do something? What'd you get grandpa for his birthday? Nothing. What did you get him? I made him a birthday card, Made out of ice cream sticks, glued on with Elmer's. Ice cream sticks? Yeah. 4 of them, so they form the number 77. I didn't get him anything. I didn't get him anything. Not me. Nobody did. (Dawn) go ahead, Flora, it's your pick. (Flora) what am I gonna do with this card? (Kane) what's the score, guys? (Orson) 13-8. Whose favor? His. (Max) ok, it's my serve. (Max) hey, where's blue going? (Dawn) I don't know. I'm gonna take a look. (Max) hey, Dawn! Come on, you guys. [screams] There he is. Cy? Hey, that's quite a roll. Are you ok? Yes. Attaboy. Gramps? Yeah? What do you want for your birthday? Peace on earth. (Emily) hmm? Peace on earth, that's all. (Kane) peace on earth? We mean, what would you want for a present, grandpa? Oh, I don't want anything. A man like me doesn't need anything. Don't need ties. Don't wear ties anymore. I don't need socks. Hell, I got more socks than I could ever wear, Even if I never did another washing. There's one thing, though. Vikings say, "cattle die, kin die, one day even you shall die. The only thing that never dies is judgment of the dead." That's it. A funeral. A proper funeral. A Viking funeral. What's a Viking? I don't know. Minnesota Vikings. They wear purple uniforms. No, Max. We're not talking about football players. We're talking about Scandinavian Vikings. Norsemen. Seamen. Great seamen. Come on. Let's sit down and face the sea. 1,000 years ago, 500 years before Columbus, They crossed the Atlantic. They had great ships, magnificent vessels for their time. You see, the sea was their whole life. The sea and their boats. And in celebrating death... Yes, you could say celebrating, they used them both. The families of the great Vikings Took the body of their loved one and put it on a ship. They covered it with straw. And as the sun was setting, they cast the boat into the water. They built huge bonfires on the beach. The priest blew into a ram's horn. Then the men would light the tips of their arrows in the bonfires And shoot them at the ship. It must have been so beautiful. Fire on the water. Legend has it that if the color of the setting sun And the color of the burning boat are the same, Then that Viking has led a good life. And in the afterlife he will go to, uh... Viking Heaven? Yes, that's it. Exactly. Something like that. All night long, the Viking men, women, and children Watched the burning boat in the water. When Dawn came, only ashes were left. Complete obliteration. Carried by the currents to the 4 corners of the earth. Fresh. Beautiful. Vanished completely. Like a dream. Kane, help me. [groans] Now, isn't that better than being buried in the earth? Absolutely. Yeah. (Kane) definitely the best way to go. Buried in the earth, the body decays. It lies there dead, rotting While slimy, starving worms suck you to the very bone. Not a pretty picture, is it? (Emily) no. We all like the Viking funeral idea better. I hate worms. [sea roaring] Come on, men. (Levi) nothing's so good as a midnight pee in the ocean. (boys) nothing's as good as a midnight pee in the ocean. [kids laugh] [bed creaking] Dawn? Go back to sleep, cy. I got one question. What's the question? Can we give the Rocket Gibraltar to grandpa For his birthday present? What are you talking about? What is the "Rocket Gibraltar"? (Emily) go back to bed, blue. Go back to bed, blue. You're waking everybody up. We'll talk about it in the morning. I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. I'll see you all tomorrow. Bye. I'm telling you, Rose, that girl has no shame. Let's face it, she's a tramp. Do you really think so? Do you remember when dad caught her In the barn with 4 basketball players? I thought that was you. (crow) hey, where you going, son? (blue) to get grandpa his birthday present. Hey, that's a good idea, cy blue. Hey, that reminds me, I've got to get him something. What did you get him? I don't know yet. Dad, have you seen blue? Yeah, he's back there. Said he's picking out a present for your granddad. Ok, so, I'm having dinner with Charles Manson last night And he says to me, "Dwayne, is it hot in here or am I crazy?" See, that's a historical joke. I'll let you know When there's a funny one coming. (Emily) blue, Dawn, wait up! (Max) I wish our bikes could just fly, like in E.T. Varoom! (Kane) oh, Max. Real cute, Max. Don't you get it? E.T. Was a movie, we're real. [panting] I think it's Freudian. Nymphomania is like hysteria. Aided and abetted by some abnormal glandular condition. So what does that mean? That I'm sick in the head or sick in the body? (Dwayne) hmm. What do you think? Which one, huh, crow? Huh? Uh, I didn't hear what you said. (Levi) where is everybody? Morning, daddy. Good morning, aggie. How's my sweetheart? (Dwayne) good morning, sir. Sir? Sir? Didn't you ever see leave it to beaver? I'm doing Eddie Haskell. It seems we have a dog in the house. (Ruby) a dog, dad? Uh-huh. I heard one moaning last night. That's impossible. Moaning and barking. Well, didn't anybody hear it? Oh, yeah. Come to think of it, there was an awful racket. (Rose and Ruby) aggie. Well, I didn't want for Vinnie to think that-- Tony! Ok, Tony. I didn't want to hurt his feelings. To think I was faking passion or anything. So I added a little bit of extra. I don't remember barking, though. [barking] [seagulls squawking] (Kane) what's the big secret? Blue says we should fix up the Rocket Gibraltar And give it to grandpa for his birthday. What would he want this cruddy old boat for? He says grandpa can use it for his funeral. Is grandpa gonna die? No, grandpa's not gonna die. Is he? He's not gonna die. Don't worry about it. What is it, Dwayne? Which do you prefer? Ring dings or orange milanos? Orange milanos. Oh, good. Here. [sputtering] (Kane) it might float. (Orson) how can we fix this up? (Max) at least it's something new. Let's do it. (Jessica) yeah. It might be fun. (Emily) ok, you guys, All in favor of fixing up this cruddy boat for grandpa's birthday Raise their hand. Yeah. (Flora) great. It's anonymous. (Dawn) hey, where's he going? (Kane) beats me. See, Kane, I told you to spell it "et." It's still gonna take some work, smart ass. That's right. Kane's being realistic. Let's go. I hope dad likes that book. What the hell do you get him, anyway? I did like the shape of that hat. The color was all wrong. Well, it's too expensive, anyway. What's too expensive? God, I need to go to the beach. I don't know how anybody can stand to wear clothes in this heat. We could go to the topless beach. Oh, that's great. I forgot my hat, anyway. Fred Astaire tapes. That's the ticket. Yes. Ok, guys, we don't have all day. Man, this tool box is heavy. You got it? Yeah, almost. This is gonna be good, guys. Come on. Pump, blue, pump. Go. (Orson) hey, Max, wait up. Wait up! Where'd Emily go? She went to the library. Watch it. We got to get power for the sander from the house down there. Now, unravel the extension cord. Tie it together. (Orson) what do I do with this again? Take the 2 ends, Tie them together, Then plug it in. Hope this works. [sander running] All right! [all cheering] Yeah. (aggie) I really don't care if you call me a nympho. It's a sure guarantee I'll never do a porno. Come again? You really don't understand anything about acting, do you? A nympho who's an actress couldn't do a porno Because then it wouldn't be acting. It would be real. That's the most depressing thing I've ever heard. Hey, Rose, check it out.

Can you give me that pillow over there? Please? Hey, Dawn. Now, ain't that the best food you ever tasted? Yeah, it's real good. Man is smarter than fish. Man eats fish, fish don't eat man. [mumbles] What are you saying? Except for the what? Shark in jaws. Shark in jaws? Ha, ha. Well, you got me there. The shark in jaws is the exception that proves the rule. There's plenty more, you know. Do you want another one? Eat some more. [screaming] Ok, come on. Let's go in. No, I don't want to go in tide pools. We'll play frisbee, then. Come on. I don't want to play frisbee. Oh, Ro. Crow, you want to play frisbee? No, I'm gonna go jogging. It will get your mind off baseball. No, I never throw anything plastic. [all chattering] Oh!

You know, Billi, you really ought to get some sun. I don't like the sun. Then why come to the beach? I like the beach, I just don't like the sun. Oh. Right. Well, that explains everything. Where is everyone? They're playing frisbee. Oh, I detest frisbee. If anyone wants to know, I'm going to play golf. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, if I could just avoid these damn sand traps everywhere. Hey, guys, I got the sail! All right! Help me unfold it. (Jessica) hey, where'd you find those? (Kane) all right. You guys put yours down. (Max) great job, guys. Where'd you find it?

We're planning a surprise. Yeah. Yeah, that's it, a surprise for grandfather. Why don't you surprise us And get cleaned up and dressed for supper? Ok, mom. We'll be down in 5 minutes. There's something I've always wanted to ask you, hank. Yeah? You've never quite forgiven me for marrying Helen, have you? Well, to tell you the truth, at the time of... At the time, I thought She was making the worst mistake of her life. I said, "Helen, "how can you marry that idealistic, "card-carrying pencil pusher when you could have me? "damn fine doctor, a man who loves you, "a man who wants to give you everything you want in life. Now don't say you don't love me, Helen, because I know you do." And what'd she say? She said... She said that... Now, you remember how young she was. She was... 17. You--you were twice that. She always had that, uh... Wisdom. She said: "hank, I am going to marry Levi... "not because I don't love you, because I love you very much. But it's because I love you that I'm marrying Levi." She said that? She did. Confused me no end. And then she said, "the reason I'm marrying Levi "and not you has nothing to do with love. "the reason I'm marrying Levi "is that he needs me and I need him. It's that simple." That's what she said. Sounds like Helen. Do you hear an echo in here, doc? There it is again. An echo. Every time we spe-- It's gone now, huh. I must be hearing things. You know, not a day went by... Not a day goes by that I don't think of Helen. Our wonderful, lovely, wise Helen. She was only human. And I couldn't save her from the cancer. You're a fine doctor, hank, But you're not God. Not yet. Hey, come on. Let's not get gloomy. It's almost your birthday, doc. One more drink and I'm off. How long have I got, hank? Huh? Don't con me. Not now. How long? Like you just said, Levi, I ain't God. Please. 2 weeks, maybe 3? Maybe shmaybe. Your guess is as good as mine. What's it all about, hank? How the hell should I know? You're the poet. I'm only the doctor. Would you believe 2 years? 2 months? 2 days? Now, get some sleep. I'll see you tomorrow. He's gonna be all right, isn't he, doc? Oh, sure, son. Sure, he just needs some rest, that's all. By the way, how's that arm of yours? I read about it in the paper. The arm's all right, it's the damn shoulder. I got some kind of a rotator cuff problem. (Dr. B.) rotator cuff? I never heard of it. But then again, I'm from the, uh, bob feller-dizzy Dean generation. Anyway, good luck with it. Dr. Bonacker? Are you sure dad's gonna be all right? Well, sure, I'm sure. He's not gonna die, is he? Die? Ha! Your father will outlive us all. Ruby, I never told you this, but, uh, Your father's a hypochondriac. He is. He's the worst I ever met. He just wants the attention, that's all. Well, tomorrow he gets all the attention, right? Right, Dr. B. Good. You'll see. Tomorrow he'll be up And dancing around like Fred Astaire. Thanks, doctor. Ing] Come on. Come on. Oh, kids, nobody's eating the hamburgers and the hot dogs. Do you know how I slaved? Mangia. Mangia. I got shrimps. Who wants shrimps? [all chattering] Who's that? Aunt Aggie's new boyfriend. What about the Guy that was here last night? That was last night. Oh, ok. [laughing] Pass the salad. Please. Please, pass the salad. All right. Butthole. [all chattering] Gin, something. Gin, like-- Your old man wants to say something. Something you've probably heard many times before. But maybe these little bums will find this funny. I'm talking about the 1950s. A long time ago. 30 years ago, when I was a blacklisted teacher and writer Trying to feed my growing family, I, believe it or not, turned to comedy. Yeah. In the dark days of McCarthyism, The cold war, and I like Ike, When you were just little boys and girls, Just like them, I became a comic. Yeah. Any requests? Garden of Eden. No. Garden of Eden. Now, that was a long time ago. I remember all the trouble in the garden of Eden. The trouble that started when Eve bit into that piece of fruit. I had the same problem myself, down in Mexico. [all laughing] But there's something that always bothered me. You take Adam and Eve. I mean, Adam was an incredibly handsome man. And Eve was an indescribably beautiful woman. So where did all you ugly people come from? Hey, hey, hey. Now, now, now. I'm a peaceful man. How peaceful are you, Levi? I'm so peaceful I'm not even antibiotic. But, seriously, folks. Seriously, folks. I know a girl who was pure, really pure. (Rolo) how pure was she, dad? She was so pure, she was considered A fanatic in the virgin islands. Was she dull? Ho, ho, ho, was she dull? She had to go topless just to be a wallflower. Come on, let's go. (Levi) let me tell you something else about this lady. Where are you guys going? You'll see. I guess they don't like comedy. More. More. More. All right, this girl's got a sister, And the sister is not pure. Has this girl been around? Has she been around? She knows 6 house detectives by their first knock. She's crossed more state lines than a greyhound bus. You see, she wants to love everybody. Problem is, that she does it to one person at a time. Women are getting bigger. Women are getting bigger. But if you don't think women are getting bigger, When was the last time you heard of one of them drowning? [all laughing] Hey, dad, what about water pollution? Oh, yes, water pollution. Well, water pollution. Let me tell you how bad water pollution is. Half the scuba equipment that's being sold Is being sold to the fishes. [all laughing] Is your wife Irish? Is my wife Irish? I don't know if she's Irish. I think she's Irish. Every time I eat her cooking, I turn green. Now, I don't want to say she's getting fat, But this morning, we had to let out the sofa. Ah, the 4th of July. Now, there's an interesting holiday. You try explaining to your kids that they can't buy fire crackers While the government's buying h-bombs. [all exclaiming] Whoo! This next tune's going out to Levi Rockwell Celebrating his 77th birthday in Sagaponack. %%[I can't explain by David bowie playing] [all cheering] %% new feeling inside %% %% it's a hot certain kind %% %% I feel hot and cold %% %% down my soul, baby %% %% I can't explain %% %% going out of my mind %% %% dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue %% %% things you say well maybe they're true %% %% I get funny dreams again and again %% %% knows what it means, but %% %% can't explain %% %% I think it's love %% [panting] Oh!

[cheering] [all cheering] (Levi) their whole life was the sea, the sea and their boats. And so, in celebrating death, Yes, you could say celebrating, They used both. The families of the Vikings would put the body Of their loved one on the ship, Cover it with straw, And then as the sun was setting, cast it away into the water. They would light huge bonfires on the beach, Then the Vikings would light the tips of their arrows in the bonfire And shoot them at the ship. Oh, it must have been so beautiful. Fire on the water. Legend has it that if the color of the setting sun And the color of the burning ship were the same, Then that Viking had led a good life, and in the afterlife He would go to Viking Heaven. Yes. All night long, the Viking men, women, and children Watched the ship with the body that burned on the water. By Dawn, all that was left was ashes. Complete obliteration. Carried by the currents to the 4 corners of the earth. Fresh and beautiful. Vanished completely. Like a dream.
