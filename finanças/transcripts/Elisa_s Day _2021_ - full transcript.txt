Those small yellow jars, you know How much does she eat? How many should I buy? Hmm, just buy all the different flavors Look how skinny the baby is, she's tiny Her mom is also really skinny Her face was so pale Poor girl, for a $40 ticket she used all the change in her wallet Let's get them more stuff Sure Go on now Sigh, look at you darling How can you be so skinny You tiny thing, you need to eat more to stay healthy Right? Chapter four: Hope Hey Man Wai Man Wai You're back from Thailand already Tough luck Arrest me if you have evidence Otherwise, leave me alone Do you know who I am? Have we met? You're a goddamn cop, I can tell You're a goddamn punk I can tell, too I have nothing to do with you Stop wasting your time Do you know your boss Took over the minibus operation And planted his men everywhere He didn't think you'd come back Then stop bothering me You had your fun in Thailand Any idea how your wife and baby lived? Let me tell you Your boss didn't give them a penny I can detain you for 48 hours And get your boss To greet you at the gate You'll never see the two of them again Be my witness And testify against your boss I guarantee, when you're released You can still see your daughter to middle school Before you do anything Think about your wife and your daughter Think about them?

We'll get better I brought these roses back From Thailand Every time I saw these roses I thought of you When I got to Thailand Bro Shing told me to avoid big cities As far as possible So I brought my pager, stole a motorbike And went to the south. I only knew to go south along the coast Until Bro Shing contacted me So at least when he wanted me back I'd know the way I went to the seaside then into the mountains No one spoke any Chinese there not even simple English I didn't know any Thai I could go for days without talking I really missed you Every single second I was thinking about you The people there pointed to the jungle And I knew if I walked in I would find the roses I really wanted to find the red roses I really wanted to see you I know one day I will bring the two of you to Thailand To the waterfalls and the red roses And the three of us Will take a family photo there Take me away with you His lawyer Sent the video to the superintendent it's a bombshell The commander said His hands are tied He just spoke to DOJ Hope there isn't enough evidence to prosecute Stay low in the office for now. I'm doomed anyway Well something's wrong You passed the board exam, just waiting for confirmation And then this happened How about this I'll find out when Man Wai will be back Arrest him and put things right He's back What? Did you know I was an orphan? What are you talking about? What about Aunt Bo? Bo found me on the streets I was homeless before 12 Because of me Bo remained single all these years The old generation was so conservative A woman with a child Who would want her? I went to see Man Wai today To see what he's like How he treats his wife and baby He looked at their photo And said "My family of three" I couldn't do it I've been under you since training It's already been a decade I won't watch you fall I'm still tainted even if you arrest Man Wai But if he's arrested The little girl might lose her parents Chapter five: Life is elsewhere Sergeant Daisy What's your last name? I don't remember I don't know what my last name is Everyone has a last name What's your dad's last name? Aren't you holding onto my file? You can see for yourself It is on the file But you're right in front of me Of course I'll ask you I confess I'm guilty What are you guilty of? My birth was a crime Daisy...

Hello? (Hold sunlight between the trees) (Pick up feathers in the breezes) (All girls like to dream all dreams) (See the birds crossing the sea) (And I wonder why they can fly in the sky) (I'm waiting for a reply) (Try to speak as you go by) (All girls like to dream all dreams) (Sing a song to the highest mountain) (And tell me why all I hear is a sigh) (Will you give me a little chance?)

I could have gone to college I was admitted for fine arts program But our income is unstable What about the child's father? Does he not care about you guys? I'm not trying to be nosey Nor say anything about what you do at the cinema... I just worry about you both The child is growing older She'll start to know things She'll remember things and ask questions You wanna continue living like this? What can I do? I have a daughter with me what can I do? I was only 15 when I had her I was too afraid to even go to the hospital I don't know how to apply for schools Her dad's always working in Mainland China We can't let people know I have a daughter Otherwise her dad will have to go to prison Then what about your daughter? Spend her whole life in the cinema? You brought her to this world, take some responsibility Then who is responsible for me?! I'm already used to this Sometimes I think I'm dirty Every time I shower I tell myself You're no longer The good and pure girl You're not You no longer are I need to make a living too I'm raising Daisy I'm an adult. Why can't I use every inch of my body? I have my own values too But I don't want my daughter to know her mother was like that Just be nice to Daisy What else can I do for you? Come over That's right Alright let's go No I don't want to Be good, go on now Dasiy we're going home How is Aunt Bo? She passed away a few years ago She passed in peace In her sleep But she kept your toys still When I turned thirteen, I went back But the cinema was gone Before When I was in the orphanage They wouldn't let me out Until I went to middle school Finally, a foster family would take me in I had some allowance I could take the bus to see Aunt Bo I kept looking for a long time But I couldn't find her I really missed her Sometimes I'd spend the whole day waiting at cinemas If I couldn't wait any longer I would go back another day I often waited until very late Before going home The foster family thought I was a bad kid They said I was never home So they stopped giving me allowance And they didn't let me out When I turned 15 I ran away Chapter six: Rose "Chang Ping (China) to Tuen Mun (Hong Kong)" This one's big It's really big I want one too How come mine is so small? Ok I'll find one for you Look, there's a lot underneath Happy birthday Thank you Why did you pick the small one? What's wrong? Uncle Cinema When will my parents be out? How about this Let me help you put on your hair clip When your parents come out You'll look really cute He won't report you for assault You're in luck He's married, he doesn't want others to find out Didn't even go to hospital You two sort it out here Leave the little girl out of it How long have you been with this man? How many men were there before him? When I came back from Thailand I followed you I knew when I was gone you had no one to lean on I knew Bro Shing didn't keep his promise You didn't have any money But when I saw these men giving you money I didn't know what I could do I didn't even have the right to tell you not to take it But... You beat up a loyal customer His name is Alex The past three years We'd deal twice every month If he couldn't come Others would come to me Some were young Some were old, some were from the Middle East I'd lie to myself Tell myself: No I'm not a prostitute I'm not a whore But half a year ago Some old man gave me $300 To have sex with him Then he told his friends And then many more older men came to me I would have sex with all of them What's wrong with you? Why are you telling me all this? Why are you telling me? Why won't you yell at me? Why aren't you beating me up? Why aren't you stopping me? I made money this year I did make money this year I worked my ass off Now I've made money I've worked hard for you I'd do anything and everything I'd be the first to jump into a fight Cleaning bathrooms, opening hair salons I'd do anything and everything for you Do you know why I had sex with old men? Because when I did it I wouldn't think of you What are you saying? What are you talking about?! At first I was only doing it for Daisy But then Alex came He's a good man, a very good man He gave me warmth I thought he could replace you You never wanted me to come back, right? You wish I never came back No, I wanted you to come back I really wanted you to come back The whole gang moved to Mainland China What else can I do? You wanted money? I tried to make it for you! I don't have a job in Hong Kong What can I do? I need people to care for me. Our daughter needs care too I'm not just looking for money Then why are you whoring yourself? Why do it if it's not for money? Half a year ago I knew you had an affair in Mainland China It was a prostitute you were pimping Alex never treated me as a prostitute Those old men did I wanted to know what it's like to be a prostitute I wanted to know why you love her Just half a year I've only been with her for half a year Because I know even if I made money You'd still go back to the cinema I love you. I love you I've always loved you But I know you don't love me anymore I wanna try to be loved To know what it's like to be loved Why Why have we come to this? Commander is asking why you won't press charges The guy didn't pursue There's no case No case? How can it be? He's all bloodied You let him go a few years back Not again, come on It's different this time It's family problem this time The two of them are still so young Their relationship issue Just let them solve it on their own It's all because of his wife and daughter He's crazy He's so violent and dangerous You are a witness there Let's just leave it Fai Don't mind me saying this I know you've fought hard to get back You wanna arrest that asshole Shing But they've moved their business to Mainland There's nothing we can do You don't wanna cut off the leads For this stupid case But these are separate cases Have you thought about the little girl? Have I thought about the little girl? You're feeling sorry for her, huh? I'm telling you She doesn't have a birth certificate You can go charge her dad And dig into it You'll know her mom was knocked up underage Then the social workers will take her She'll become an orphan So what? I'm thinking... Even if we don't charge him We still need to deal with this Listen to me I've followed them for four years I was there at the cinema You should understand Let this one go I'll find other ways to help them What other ways? Like leaving them alone? Doing nothing is helping? You're kidding me Come over for a second If he does anything to you... You never said you were a cop You never told me you knew my man Don't ever come near my daughter again Uncle cinema Uncle cinema! Uncle cinema!!

You didn't find her for 14 years! 14 years ago I made a mistake I could never atone for I ruined Daisy's family The past decade I couldn't face them I couldn't face myself But I can't run away this time I can't do that anymore I can't sit and do nothing I cannot let Daisy continue like this This is the last time I can make amends We should never Never give up on them again.
