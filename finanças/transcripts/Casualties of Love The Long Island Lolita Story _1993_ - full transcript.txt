I'm really sorry. Where the hell have you been? I was at the studio. What, till 5:00 in the morning? Yes! We were partying. That's why I didn't come home. Come on. I'm really sorry, Mary Jo. What does that mean, "I'm sorry"? I'm sitting here, I don't know whether you're dead or alive or wrapped around some tree, Joey. I'm waiting for the police to call, for the phone to ring. I can't take this anymore. I'm not wrapped around a tree. Sweetheart, I'm right here. Now, come on. Give me a hug. I don't wanna have sex with you. I know that. I don't wanna have sex with you. I just wanna be close to you. Come on! Joey, no. I've had it. I swear to-- You promised me that you'd quit. You promised you'd get off the coke. I can't take this anymore. You're just giving me ulcers. All right. All right! I gotta get up for work in a half hour. Let me sleep, and we'll talk in the morning. We're not talking about this anymore. What are you bitching about? You got plenty of money, you got food in the refrigerator and the bills are paid. What are you giving me such a hard time for? This is gonna be your last hard time. What's this? Where are you going? I'm not going anywhere. You're the one who's going. Now, I called your father, I spoke to my parents, and I made all the arrangements. Joseph, sit down now! Now, I'm driving you over to a rehab, and you're checking in, and you're getting off this coke for good. Because if you ev-- Listen to me. If you ever do it again, I am taking these kids, and I'm leaving you. Now, it's all up to you. Now, what's it gonna be? It's either the coke or your family. [WHISPERS] What's it gonna be? [♪♪♪] JOEY: Mary Jo! Mary Jo! Look at you. You shaved your beard! I didn't even recognize you. [LAUGHING] [SIGHS] It's me. It's the old me. So how do you feel? Great. Good. I'm taking it one day at a time, and I'm feeling better than ever. The kids know I'm coming home? Oh, yeah. They think you've been in Florida, but they miss you. Well, I missed them a lot too. Mary Jo, look, my drug addiction is like a disease of the attitude. Yeah. Sweetheart, I had such a bad attitude, I don't know how you ever put up with me. I'm sorry. Well, I guess you're worth it. [BOTH LAUGH] MAN: Hey, Joey! Yo! Good luck, man. Jason, it's been great knowing you, brother! Hey, Joey, is that Mary Jo? Yeah. [LAUGHS] Is she the most beautiful wife in the world or what? Joey!

But remember, you ever need any auto-body work done, bring it to me, Complete Auto Body in Baldwin. I'll give you Joey's discount special, all right? I'll be there. All right. Look, you guys take care of yourselves. Remember I love you, stay sober and God bless! You running for office or something? Will you get in the car? Hey, I love these guys. But most of all, I love Mary Jo! Will you get in the car?! See you, guys! [♪♪♪] Hey, Joey, you all right? Your arm getting tired? Huh? Come on! Don't hurt yourself. You gotta work today. [GROANS] One round, one round. Come on. Hey, we got a customer. Where? Customer, customer. BOBBY: Oh, damn. Come here. Damn it. What's the matter? This must be this nutcase's daughter. This guy comes in yesterday, right? He wants pinstripes on his daughter's car. Yeah? That car. He can't make up his mind what color. First black, then white. No, red. Ooh, is it fancy enough? Drove me nuts. This must be the kid. What, are you a psychic? Hi. How you doing? Hi. Hi. Uh, I think my father was in here yesterday. Yeah. Yeah, he wanted pinstripes put on your car. What color did he want? Let me ask you something. What color do you want? Heh, black would be great. Black. We got black. I kind of got another problem. I was wondering if I could show it to you. Yeah. What happened? Well, I was backing out of my garage, and I crashed against the side of it. But I can't tell my father what happened 'cause I just got my learner's permit. My mother might make him take the car away. She didn't want him to give me one right away. A car, I mean. He's gonna drop off the car to you to put the pinstripes on. And I gotta tell him tonight what happened. But when you guys look at cars, you could tell what happened. Okay, okay. So, what do you wanna tell him? I'm gonna tell him I was having dinner with my boyfriend at the Lighthouse Diner in Montauk, and when we came out, someone had kicked the mirror off. So will you guys go along with that? Please. Excuse me for just a second. Okay? Joey. What? Listen, I think this is a weird family, and I don't got the patience. So you take care of it. Bobby, money's money. I got it. No problem. Uh... All right. I'll cover for you. Oh, great. Great. So when my father comes in, we'll pretend we never met. No problem. I'll take care of it. Thank you, thank you. You are saving my life. That's what we're here for. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. You got it. Thank you. Take it easy. Bye. [ENGINE STARTS] It's all over, Dad! You're a goner! You're dead, Paulie! Say your last rites!

[JOEY EXCLAIMS] [LAUGHING] Gonna get you! You're gonna give me whiplash, Joey. I'll give you a kiss. You're gonna give me a kiss? No, don't-- What are you doing?! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! No jumping out of cars! No jumping out of cars! Come on. That's it. We're sorry. The ride is over. You see the sign over there? "No head-on bumping." Come on, sweetheart. Whole family, everybody out. Everybody just calm down. Relax. I'm gonna have a little talk. No, nothing to talk about. Come on. I got rules. It's my kids' birthday. I got insurance! They're twins. You're gonna close me down with that. Look, let me give you 10 bucks, all right? Ten bucks? All right. I'll give you 20. Here. I'll give you 20. Twenty. Twenty-five, okay? There you go. That's all I got. Five minutes. No acrobats. Guess what? We've been forgiven! Let the games continue! Here we go! When she walked out of the diner, she found out some idiot had kicked her mirror in. It wasn't her fault, but she feels terrible. Oh, I almost forgot. After you repair the car, when you put the, uh... Pinstripes? The pinstripes on, I want you to stencil her name on the sides. Okay. "Aimee." That's spelled A-I-M-E-E. Two E's. Yeah. But I want that to be a big surprise. I don't want her to know. My lips are sealed, Mr. Fisher. [CAR HORN HONKS] Ah, here comes my little princess now. Just make the car perfect. Polish it up real shiny. See, my daughter, she ran away, and she was gone for almost two weeks. We didn't know where she was, and now she's back. I want everything to be perfect. You got it. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Amy. This is Joey. Joey's gonna take care of you. Hi, it's nice to meet you, Joey. Real pleasure. I don't want you to worry about a thing. I'm gonna make your car look like it's brand-new. Thank you. Here you go. Okay. Anything else I can do for you, Mr. Fisher? Eh, call me Elliot. No, no. You've earned Mr. Fisher. I like to treat a man with the respect that he deserves. So that's how it's gonna be. To me, you're Mr. Fisher, huh? Well, all right. You see? This is a nice man. He's not like those guys you run around with. He's polite, very respectful. He owns his own business. This is the kind of man I'd like to see you end up with. Well, hey, you two have a great day, okay? Thanks. JOEY: Hey, I hope I never see you again. That was a joke, Dad. Oh, heh, I get it. [CHUCKLES] Hey, I got you, Mr. Fisher. Take it easy. MAN: Twenty-five-hundred-dollar job? It's almost totaled. [♪♪♪] Amy! How the hell did you this? I drove over something. It was cement, and it had these studs sticking up all over it. As soon as I went over it, it just smashed up into the car. Amy, you got some major damage here. You have to tell your father about this. No, no. We can't! Then he's gonna ask where this happened. I was in Levittown when I was supposed to be in school, okay? We can't. All right. Just calm down. Come on, come on, come on. [CRYING] Everything will be all right, okay? I'll take care of you. Everything will be all right. All right? All right, look. Now, come on. Give me a smile. Come on. Stop crying all over that pretty face of yours. I'm not pretty. Excuse me, but I happen to be a connoisseur of pretty women, and you are a very pretty young lady. [CHUCKLES] There's that smile I know. Come on. Here, here. Wipe your face. Now, let's see how we can fix this car, okay? Okay. For the least amount of bucks possible. Of course, I'll throw in Joey's special discount one more time for you, huh? [CHUCKLES] How old are you? I'm 37. Why? [AMY GIGGLES SOFTLY] It's just that I like older guys. I mean, the boys in my school, one, two, three, you know, and it's, like, over. Excuse me, but, uh, what do you mean, "one, two, three, and it's over"? [GIGGLES] You know, they get on top of you, one, two, three, and they're finished before they even started. Really? When I was 12 years old, my parents had a tile man doing Italian marble in the house. And he was the first guy I ever did it with. Get out of here. You're serious? Yeah. Amy, you had sex when you were 12 years old? [LAUGHS] Yeah. It was a guy right off the boat from Italy. He didn't even speak English. I just saw him recently, but it wasn't the same. Wow. You really did it when you were 12? What are you looking at me for? I'm a old dog. I got a family. I'm all used up. [LAUGHS] Oh, no. You're in great shape. I can tell you work out because you have really nice arms. Yeah, well, I work out at this little hole-in-the-wall gym. I need a new gym. The one I go to now is like a pickup joint. I could you introduce you to my friend. He owns the place, Paul Makely. That'd be great. Good. How come, uh... How come you got a beeper? So, you know, people who need me can get ahold of me. Like when my car's finished, you could beep me, heh. I could beep you? Yeah, heh. I'm gonna give you a special code. You know what it's gonna be? 007. 007? What am I, like James Bond over here? [BOTH CHUCKLE] No, you're not James Bond. James Bond couldn't even come close to you. [♪♪♪] Oh, Bobby, would you do that? I'd do that. Oh, I'd do that. Would you do that? Nah. Nah, I wouldn't do that. I would definitely do that. Yeah. What are you staring at? All right! She's gone! Now can you get back to work? JOEY: Okay, Dad. Okay. Come on. Come on! We got work to do.

I don't know. Did your wife have any enemies? Whoa, excuse me. Who are you? Who are you? Mike Brindenour. He's my lawyer. Lawyer? What do you need a lawyer for? Joey, come here. He's like one of the family. Who are you? What do you guys got? I'm his brother. Vince Donnelly. What do you got? Just find out who did it, and then I'm gonna kill him, understand? Tell me what happened. I don't know what happened. Excuse me. I really do have to talk to Mr. Buttafuoco. Did you by any chance have an argument with your wife? What? Mr. Buttafuoco? That's me. Uh, can I see you in private? Um, come this way, please. Mike, Bobby. Mr. Buttafuoco, I'm afraid I can't give you any false hope. It's touch and go. Is she gonna die? Well, these are your options. If we don't operate, yes, she will die within 12 hours. However, if we do operate, Mr. Buttafuoco, I can't guarantee that she will come out of it, and even if she comes out of it, I can't guarantee that she will not be paralyzed. Paralyzed? There's a bullet in her head. And there's a great deal of internal damage. Now, even if I can't remove it, I can go around it, redirect the arteries that are working to continue blood flow to the brain. Nevertheless, this is highly dangerous, and I need you to decide. Do you want me to operate? I... I don't... [MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY] Hey, don't drop the weights! MAN: I'm sorry. Next time you drop the weights, I'm throwing you out of here. Hey, that looks a lot better. Seriously, you're looking good. Hey, Paul. Ooh, Amy. Wow, what's the matter with you? You look white as a ghost. Oh, I'm not feeling so good. So did your girlfriend move out yet? Heh-heh, Amy, I told you. She's the mother of my kid. It's not an easy relationship to break off. Paul! Hey, man, check this out. Joey Buttafuoco's wife was shot in the head yesterday. PAUL: What? "Wife of Joey Buttafuoco shot in the head." Thanks, man. Did you hear about this? Yeah, I heard. It's too bad, huh? Did you call Joey and see how his wife is doing? No. No, I'm gonna call him now. It's amazing. She got shot in the head and she's still alive, huh? So I thought you said you weren't seeing him anymore. I'm not. You are my boyfriend. I am not seeing Joey anymore. Mm-hm. And you didn't have nothing to do with this, huh? [BOTH LAUGH] Me? You are a sick man, Paul. A very sick man. PAUL: Whoa, Amy. [WHISPERS] Hey, be careful. Let's go upstairs. Right now? [SOFTLY] Come on. Right now. Mary Jo? Mary Jo? It's me, Joey. Hi. [WHIMPERS] [SHUSHES] Shh, it's okay. It's okay, I'm here. It's okay. Do you know who did this? Huh? I'm gonna give you a pen, and I want you to write that down for me, okay? Can you do that for me? Here, write it down right here for me. Ann Marie? Are you sure? Do I know her? Did she say anything? Did she say anything, honey? "Complete shirt"? Complete Autobody shirt? JOEY: She had one? Are you sure? Me? I gave it to her? [♪♪♪] I only gave out one Complete Autobody shirt... to Mr. Fisher's daughter. That's the only one that I gave out. It's Mr. Fisher's daughter. [SIREN BLARES] [TIRES SCREECHING] [DISPATCHER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER POLICE RADIO] Would you step out of the car, please? What is going on? I wasn't speeding. Are you Amy Fisher? Yeah. Step out of the car. What--? What's going on? Step out of the car right now. Thank you. What's going on? We'd like to talk to you. Impound this. I didn't do anything wrong. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Hey, Joseph, I've got Amy in custody, been talking to her since 8:00 last night. What's she saying? She said you gave her the gun. What? There's no way that I gave her that-- Shh! There's a lady coming up, she's a reporter for Newsday. You don't need her hearing what you're saying. There's no way I gave her that gun. No way! She's lying. Yeah, but you do have guns, right? Yeah, sure, sure. I got a .45, I got a .38, I got a .22, but I am legal, I'm 100% legal. Well, she says you gave her the gun. She's lying, all right? Relax. We've had her in here all night. We got a long way to go. We're just gonna go in there now and tell her what you said. Joey, pull up a chair, have yourself a cup of coffee. I don't drink coffee. Well, then have a donut. All right. Joe, this is our boss. Sergeant Severin? Hi. Joey Buttafuoco. Nice to meet you. Hi. Go ahead. Donuts, coffee. He knew I was gonna shoot Mary Jo. He promised me that with Mary Jo out of the way, we could be together. Wait, now you're saying that he knew you were gonna shoot Mary Jo? You mean he conspired with you to murder his own wife? Yeah. He wanted me to kill her. And he gave you the gun? No. No. Oh. I didn't get the gun from Joey. I got it from somebody else. I know that's not what I said before, but this time I am telling the truth. So now the truth is that he knew you were gonna shoot his wife but he didn't give you the gun? Right. I'm sorry I lied before, but I was scared, you know? So I didn't get the gun from Joey, but he knew-- He knew that I was gonna shoot her. He knew on May 19th that you were gonna shoot Mary Jo? No. We had broken up by then. Well, if you had broken up, then why did you shoot her? Because he started saying these bad things about my boyfriend, Paul Makely. Wait a second. Who the hell is Paul Makely? Paul Makely? He's this guy that owns a gym that Joey introduced me to, and then he got, like, real-- Really jealous. Wait a second. Now, let me get this straight. You and Joey had an affair, but Joey didn't give you the gun. But Joey knew you were gonna shoot his wife, and then the two of you broke up? And then you got angry at Joey for saying bad things about your new boyfriend, Paul Makely? Right. Right. That's it. That's it. How many versions are we gonna listen to of this, huh? [SNIFFLES] All right, we are gonna start all over again from the beginning, very slow, and you're gonna tell us the truth. I don't understand. What don't you guys get? We don't understand anything! Start over! Okay! Okay! Come on! All right! All right. All right, from the beginning. From the beginning... My car got crashed, okay? I went into this body shop and I met Joey Buttafuoco. We started going out... [MARTY SIGHS] That is one tough broad. A 17-year-old with a 40-year-old mind. Is she still telling you I gave her the gun? No, she changed her story... a few times. We're gonna take care of that in the statement. Whatever you gotta do, right? She swears you were her boyfriend. You two were having an affair until you tried to break it off. Is that what she's telling you? Joey, what was your relationship with her? I used to fix her car. I must have fixed it, like, about 10 or 13 times. She'd wreck it, I'd fix it. She was always coming into my shop. I treated her with respect. I was nice to her like I am to all my customers, right? And that was it. That was her relationship to me. Strictly a working relationship. Do I need a lawyer or something? A lawyer? What do you need a lawyer for? I'm kind of curious about something. What--? What could happen to a guy if he was with a 16-year-old? Nothing. How about a 17-year-old? Nothing, absolutely nothing. I mean, I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure the statutory-rape laws have been taken off the books. Oh. Well... doesn't apply to me anyway since I wasn't with her. Oh, yeah? Then why'd you just ask that question? I was curious. It's a shocking story, a tale of adultery and of attempted murder in Massapequa. Earlier today, the police arrested a 17-year-old girl from Merrick, charging her with gunning down her boyfriend's 37-year-old wife... Boyfriend? What? Definitely a twisted tale of jealous revenge. According to police, Joey Buttafuoco has already admitted to this affair. This is what Detective Sergeant Severin had to say. SEVERIN: This is a case of fatal attraction. She became involved in a sexual affair with him about a year ago. That's a lie! Joseph Buttafuoco was attempting to walk away from that affair, which led us to the incident. That's a lie. I never said I had an affair. Where did he get that from? Did you talk to this guy? [OVERLAPPING ARGUING] I have to change the dressings on the wound now. I just need to talk to my wife for a couple minutes, please. No, Mr. Buttafuoco. You said it was just gonna be 15 minutes. He loves you too much! That guy's a liar! I don't want you talking to the police without me. I just have to change her dressings. JOEY: Honey, it'll be okay. I love you, Mary Jo. Bye. You doing okay? Yeah, thanks. [CRYING SOFTLY] REPORTER: Mr. Buttafuoco! Joey! Mr. Buttafuoco, over here! Is your wife better today than yesterday? All I can say right now is that we're praying for her recovery. What can you tell us...? Can you tell us...? Is her progress day-to-day? Mr. Buttafuoco... [♪♪♪] [MARY JO GROANING SOFTLY] Hi, honey. How are you feeling? What'd you say? I can't hear out of this ear. I know. Mary Jo, you're gonna be deaf in that ear. And my eye's all spasmed, and I've got this ringing in my ear, and-- Oh, my God. What's happened to my hair? They had to shave it. What happened to my hair? They had to shave it for the operation. It'll grow back. It's okay. Oh, my God. Shh, shh. Come on. Come on. Oh, I need a shower. You want a shower? Yeah. Well, I'll give you a shower, okay? Okay? Here we go. Come on. Got a shower right over there. Come here. Put your arm out. I'll give you a shower. Joey... What's the matter? Did you have an affair with that girl? No, honey, that cop was lying. It was a lie. But he said on television that you admitted to having an affair-- I didn't say that. Why would she shoot me, Joey? I don't know. Mary Jo, I don't know. She's nuts. She said that you were sleeping with her. No. No. I need for you to believe me. I never had an affair with her. Please. Okay? Now, come on. [GRUNTS] [SOBS] Let me squeeze through here. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! This is me? Look at me! JOEY: Hold on to me, honey. Hold on. Turn around. How humiliating... I can't even wash myself. No, no, this is gonna be great, sweetheart. Come on, I love giving you a shower. Here, come on. Need to cover that. All right. Here we go. Come on. [SOBBING] It's all right. It's all right, sweetheart. [SHUSHING] Up against the wall, Mrs. Buttafuoco. Come on. Here we go. Hey, don't get personal. But I'm the personal type, huh? [LAUGHING] [LAUGHS] Turn around. Let me get your back now. Because of what Severin said, everybody thinks I'm guilty. I want to tell the press I never had an affair with Amy and I never told Severin I did. All I did was meet him for two minutes. "Hello, goodbye." That was it. Nothing else. I prepared a statement. We'll go to the press. Today's our lucky day. Alger's here. You guys had a bomb threat? Forget about the bomb threat. I want something in tomorrow's paper retracting what Severin said! You understand me? Whoa, whoa, Joey, we're very, very sorry. We don't know why Severin said what he said, but we can't retract a statement that's already been made. Why not? The Nassau County Police Department isn't gonna stand around with egg on its face. He says something and I gotta pay the price? What, it's a joke? You're gonna have to eat it. Listen, I prepared a statement for Joey. He'd like to tell the truth. We don't think it's a good idea for you to be reading any statement. Why not? Yeah, why can't my son make a statement? Mr. Buttafuoco, just listen to Marty-- "Buttafuoco." Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys, heh. We are on your side, okay? And I'm just advising you, for your own good, any questions a reporter asks you, you answer with a "no comment." You're just gonna make things worse. Trust me. Let it go. It'll all fade away. You won't regret it, Joey. Come on, will you hurry up, Joey? Amy's gonna be on A Current Affair. What? They just announced they got a video of her working as a hooker. Come on, she'll be right on. The sad, sorry and often seamy saga of the Long Island Lolita took a dramatic new turn tonight. 17-year-old Amy Fisher, accused of shooting a Long Island housewife over an obsession for her alleged victim's husband, so often portrayed as a lovelorn innocent. But tonight, we show you a different Amy Fisher. AMY: Let's take care of business, then we can take care of pleasure. I don't like to think about both at the same time. You're a little nervous, aren't you? See? I'm clean. Condoms, heh-heh. Turn off the light. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] [SOFTLY] Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven. Joey? Mike. What are you doing here? Bobby told me you were here. We gotta talk. Have you seen this? What is this? Now they're saying I'm a pimp? Yeah. And that you forced her into a life of prostitution. That's nuts! The press is gonna be asking you all about this. They're camped outside my office this morning. Tell me about it. I had to duck them just to come over here this morning. This is big now, Joey. This is huge. How did this ever happen to us? Hey. How was she? Mike, I never had sex with her. [SCOFFS] Come on. You're so full of crap. I'll look you straight in the eye and tell you, I never had sex with her. Joey, I don't care. I know that you had an affair with her. I mean, no, I don't know it for a fact, but I know you did. I didn't. I never did. What? You didn't do her even once? Not once! Well, I... It's irrelevant anyway, huh? Let's just drop it. No! No. I want you to believe me, Mike. Joey... I'm with the rest of the world here. It all fits together. I mean, why--? Why did all this happen? Mike... between you and me... Yes... I did flirt with her. But I swear on my mother's grave, Michael... I never had sex with her. "Joe promised that he would never let anybody hurt me, but he hurt me more than anybody. That is, except for my father. You know something? I've been asking myself things like, 'Why was I ever born?' 'Cause I just don't understand, like, why my mom ever had me. I mean, she let my father do such terrible things to me, and she just looked the other way. She didn't do anything to stop it. And now all she can say is she's sorry, and all my father can say, as a pathetic person that he is, is that he's sorry too. But you know what? The best part of getting involved with Joey... is that I met you, Paul. And, well... [SIGHS] I...love...you. Bye." PROSECUTOR: One might describe Amy Fisher as an average 17-year-old living at home with her parents. But that would be about as accurate as describing John Gotti as a businessman from New York City. She is uncontrollable, manipulative and extremely dangerous. And so, Your Honor, if bail must be set, I suggest it be in the amount of $2 million. REPORTER: Judge Marvin Goodman did set the Long Island teen's bail at $2 million, which is the highest bail in the history of New York State. Even serial killers have not received such high bail. I got no comment! No comment! I already said everything I gotta say! Get 'em out of here! Goodbye! Look, you're the third guy that's bugged me today. I didn't know anything about the escort service. He never had an affair with her. Joey's a good guy. It's the wires. The wires aren't buried underground like in other parts of the country. So with all this electricity in the air, it fries some people's brains. Mid-Island Syndrome. That's what Amy's got. Having sex with an underage girl is rape. Joey Buttafuoco raped Amy Fisher. And I have here a copy of the receipt from the motel where Joey took her. [REPORTERS CLAMORING] It's him. Here he comes. Here he comes. What about Mary Jo? Mr. Buttafuoco! I have to ask you a few questions! Mr. Buttafuoco, please, please! Can you give me a moment, sir? I need to ask some questions. Were you Amy's lover? Did you give her the gun? Sorry, I can't make a comment. Do you have an escort service? Mary Jo works as a bookkeeper at that escort service. Is it true? Can you respond to that? Are you kidding me? No, I'm not. What about the motel receipts? Your attorney says they were forged. Were they? I have no comment. I cannot respond to any of these questions right now. They've had the writing on the receipts analyzed. They say it's your writing. Hey, where are you from? Liverpool, England. You know Paul McCartney? He was a bit before my time. Have you quit your job? Are you still working? I'm just taking care of Mary Jo now. It's my only job I have. That's admirable, Buttafuoco. Why can't you respond to any of our questions? What about Amy's lawyer's allegations that you're a pimp and a liar and a drug dealer? What about it? I cannot respond to these questions right now. Why not? Give me a break, please? All right, you know, it's awfully hot out there today. You guys must be getting thirsty, huh? Yeah. Could you get us a drink? Sure, I'll take your orders in one minute. Talk to us! How's Mary Jo? I got one comment I can make. What's that? If you look under my picture in my yearbook, you know what it says? What? It says, "I love Mary Jo!" That's what it says. That was years ago, Buttafuoco! What the hell are you screaming at? I was just telling them how I feel about you. How you feeling? Huh? [LOUDER] How you feeling? Oh. Yeah, it feels good to get up. Yeah? Want me to make you something to eat? No. You want some hot tea? No. No, thanks. Leave it off the hook, okay? Why? [TELEPHONE RINGS] It's just driving me crazy. Hello? No, no, no. No, I can't comment on that right now. Leave it off the hook. Okay. Okay. It's off. I'm sorry. That phone's been driving me crazy all day long. Joey... What's going on with all these motel receipts? Mary Jo, how many times I got to tell you? I never went to that motel. My name was spelled wrong on one of the receipts. Am I gonna spell my own name wrong? No! When the cops went there with the photo and showed it to the clerk, he didn't know who the hell I was. I never went there, all right? [TAPPING ON WINDOW] All those guys, they're driving me a little nuts, you know? I'm just trying to get a little peace and quiet here. They're just parked outside the front of our house. Oh, I'm just trying to recover. [SIGHS] They're just doing their job. I've just about had it with their doing their job. I've just about had it with just about everything. I'm sorry, honey. I don't know what to say. What do you mean, you don't know what to say? Mary Jo, I'm not the one who shot you. It's not my fault. Your fault? One of your customers did! I have a bullet in my head because of your friend Amy Fisher! Whom you claim you never had an affair with! She just did it for some reason, we don't know why! It's not your fault. It's not your fault. I've had it with you! And I've had it with the press! And I've had it with the lawyers! And I've had it with all the money people! I've had it with everything! You know, you're my husband! Why didn't you know she was this kind of a person? You're my husband! You're supposed to protect me! [SOBS] You done now? Yeah. Good. You feel better? Yeah. [SNIFFLES] Yeah. Good. Yeah. Good. I'm gonna go up and take a shower and a shave now. [SOBS] Wait a minute. You're just gonna let me stand here and clean all this up by myself? I'm gonna go up and shower. That was my plan. This was not my plan. REPORTER: After two months behind bars, Amy Fisher is free. The $2-million bond was posted, part of the money provided by a television company that has secured the exclusive rights to Amy Fisher's story. [TV SHUTS OFF] I don't believe this. How do we know she's not gonna come back and, like, finish off the job? Don't worry about that. I'm not gonna let her near this house. How are you gonna stop her? I know we've been over this a million times, but if you didn't have an affair with her, then why is she trying to kill me? Mary Jo, none of this makes sense. She's so in love with me, she wants to kill you, but she's also in love with Paul Makely. And she's having sex with some kids that she tried to hire to be hit men? Plus, she's a prostitute? Sweetheart, this is all nuts. All of this is nuts. Amy Fisher is nuts. This is like the worst thing that could ever happen. No. No, no. The worst thing that could happen is that you would be dead. The reason you're not dead is God knew this was all wrong. This was not supposed to happen, Mary Jo. I love you. And only you. I want to make love to you. [CHUCKLES] [BOTH LAUGHING] I know. I'm just scared, that's all. I know, sweetheart. I won't push you. But I miss you, and I want to be with you. At least she didn't take away my body. Amen. Come on, give me a break, please? All right, you know, it's awfully hot out there today. You guys must be getting thirsty, huh? Yeah. Could you get us a drink? JOEY: I'll take your orders in one minute. Talk to us! How's Mary Jo? I got one comment I can make. REPORTER: What's that? If you look under my picture in my yearbook, you know what it says? What? It says, "I love Mary Jo!" That's what it says. Way to go, Joey! Don't you got some work to do? Yeah. Then why don't you go do it? JOEY: Hey, Frankie... Hey, Dad, what's everybody doing up here? We just watched you on television. Oh, yeah? Yeah, you're a real jerk, you know that? What did I do? You come across like a real jerk. You pretend like you're a star for the camera. Why don't you get rid of the stupid earring, huh? Get rid of the eelskin boots, get rid of the jewelry. And don't wear a black shirt on TV because it makes you look like a Mafia hit man! Is that the image you wanna put out to the public? If it is, you're gonna get public sentiment against you. Bobby, this is who I am. This is what I am. This is the way I've always been. He's right, Bobby. Nothing's changed. Yeah. Pop, he wore the damn sunglasses on TV! Heh, Bobby, I always wear sunglasses. If people can't see your eyes, they think you got something to hide! All right, calm down, the both of you! Joey, Bobby is right. When you go in front of the cameras, I want you to come off more like, "We're the victims here. We didn't do anything wrong." Mike, all I said was, "I love Mary Jo." What's so wrong with that? Because you were happy. Why were you happy on TV? Why was I happy? Because my wife is still alive. That's why I'm happy! You don't get it! He don't understand this! We don't need this! You're your own worst enemy! Shut up! Calm down. Come back here, Bobby. Bobby... I want to talk to you. Upstairs. Come on. Hey, Mike, what was that all about? We just heard from Americo Insurance. So what? They said if you're ever implicated into this mess, meaning if the police ever do tie you to Amy Fisher, then they can't continue to do business here anymore. What are they talking about? My personal problems have nothing to do with this business. And Pop's been in this spot for 40 years. One thing has nothing to do with the other, am I right? You're right, Joey. But the fact is, Joey, if you go down, this whole family goes down with you. [CLATTERING] Dad? Dad! BOBBY: Pop! Pop! JOEY: Dad? Jeez, Cas! Call the ambulance! Call the ambulance, Mike! Hold his head, Bobby, hold his head. I got it, Pop, I got it. If you feel your arm, that's good. You'll be all right. Hold on, hold on. Mike, get that ambulance here! You'll be all right, Pops. Hold on, now. Come on, Dad. [♪♪♪] [JOEY SNIFFLING, CRYING] Mom, please bless Dad. He needs your blessing right now. He had a double heart attack, and the doctors say they can't operate because his arteries are too clogged. Bless Mary Jo... and give her and the children the strength... to get through all this, please. Please give me the strength to be there for them. To be able to take care of them. Mom... Mom, I miss you. I wish you were here to help me, Mom. [SOBBING] Remember, the purpose of the meeting is to give your input to the assistant DA concerning Amy's plea. I want this girl to go to jail forever for what she did to me. I know. I'm not interested in any plea. I mean, unless they promise-- [METAL DETECTOR BEEPS] Excuse me, can you step back through here? Did I just do that? I'm afraid you did. Matt, she's with me. I don't-- Well, I gotta check-- It's the bullet in your head. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. I'm sorry. Hey, you're gonna be setting off airports all over the country, huh? [BOTH CHUCKLE] Thanks, Matt. Yeah. Unless they promise not to go after Joey on the statutory-rape charge. Joey's just sitting around the house right now, waiting from some policeman to come in and drag him off to jail because of-- On her say. But if they agree not to pursue the statutory-rape charge, then maybe... Maybe I'll accept a plea bargain. The DA's already said he's not gonna do that. He's got to investigate Amy's charges, and they might arrest Joey. Then I want her to go to trial. Okay. Then that's what we're gonna tell them. Well, let's do it. Okay. Excuse me. Excuse me. [KNOCKS] Pop! What are you doing out of the hospital? Mr. Buttafuoco! We'll wait for you outside. Okay, honey. Come on in, come on in. Oh, it's really coming down. Yeah. You know, some of those newspaper people are good people. Yeah. But I wouldn't want their job. Come on in. Sit down. Want me to take your hat? Yeah. Give me. Give me that. Sit down. How you feeling? Joey, why don't you get Cas something to drink? What do you feel like? Just a glass of water. All right. I'll get it. Mary Jo, can I talk to you? Yeah. Sure, Cas. What's the matter? You look upset. I am upset. I'm mad and I'm frustrated, because I'm old and I can't fight this. What's the matter? Thanks. You're welcome. This Naiburg... Amy's lawyer... You know, he just subpoenaed all of the shop's records for the Fishers for the last year and a half. Yeah. Oh, no. They're coming after us. And I'm... Oh, in my younger days, I would've put up such a fight. Yeah, Dad, what are you getting at? Mary... let Amy cop a plea. I mean, let them do what they want to do with her. Don't worry. Forget your principles. Wait a minute. What are you saying, that it's my fault that they subpoenaed the shop? Ha! Mary... they're gonna destroy the business, a business I spent 45 years of my life building. Can't you just tell the DA you don't care if they let her off? What difference does it make, really? [SCOFFS] What are you blaming me for? I mean, I just answered the door, and some girl comes and shoots me in the head! I mean, if someone shot you, you would wanna go after them too, Casper. All right, sorry I came. It was a mistake. I didn't mean to upset you. Just so fed up with everyone throwing this whole thing back at me. I mean, I didn't do anything wrong. You're right, I'm sorry. It's not just about revenge, either. I'm just trying to protect my husband here. All right, I'm gonna go home now. Just wait a minute. Sorry-- Casper, careful. No-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, honey. We'll work it out somehow. [SIGHS] Okay. I'll call you, huh? Good night. [THUNDER CRASHING] [SIGHS] Hey, Mary Jo. So how did it go in court today? There's gonna be a press conference on TV any minute. What happened? None of it mattered, Mary Jo. You had no say in the plea. They cut a deal with her. Joey, turn on the TV! And this was the scene today at the Nassau County Courthouse where Amy Fisher pleaded guilty to one count of reckless assault, for which she'll only receive five to 15 years. Reckless assault? How can they do this, Mike? What, they dropped the attempted murder charge, the criminal use of a firearm charge, the armed felony charge, the criminal possession of a weapon charge? Why? They cut a deal with Amy. In exchange for dropping all the other charges, she's gonna testify in front of the grand jury so they can go after Joey. [SIGHS] We got one fish, and we're going after the other fish. We're going after Joe Buttafuoco for statutory rape. And we're looking into other allegations of Joe being involved in a conspiracy to murder his wife. REPORTER: Did you make a deal with Amy Fisher... Oh, my God. How much more of this can I take? I can't take much more of this. [MARY JO SIGHING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Joey, Mary Jo. I'm sorry, we're gonna have to search the house. You think you're gonna find a strand of Amy's hair? I'm advising you for your own good-- Some more good advice? I really appreciate this. Can I see the warrant? This was not our idea, okay? Hello? What, are you kidding me? You guys are really amazing, you know that? What's going on? How's Pop doing? He's taking it bad, Joey. Come on, Pop. Bad. Very bad. I don't do any criminal things. Just don't worry about it. Hey, where are you taking me? They got a warrant. I don't care what they got! This is my lot. ["HARD COPY" THEME PLAYS] This is Hard Copy for Friday, September 25th, 1992. Hello and welcome. I'm Barry Nolan. A videotape that exposes the truth about New York's infamous Lolita, teenager Amy Fisher, who took a gun and shot the wife of the man she said was her lover. The case was supposed to come to an end this week. Amy, now 18, agreed to plead guilty to a lesser charge, accept five to 15 years in jail, and everyone was supposed to get on with their lives. But Rafael Abramovitz, an investigative reporter for Hard Copy, has found something that has blown the case wide open, a videotape of the real Amy Fisher, made before Amy made her plea. I want to keep my name in the press as long as possible. Why? Why? I can make a lot of money. I figure if I have to go through all the pain and suffering, heh, I'm getting a Ferrari. BARRY: The night before, she was here. The clock on the wall says 10:36. She already knows what tomorrow will bring, and she's bragging about the deal she will get. My lawyer says two years, nine months and a week. That'll be my total jail time. Then he says he's coming up personally to get me out. So I want you to marry me. What? What?! AMY: I'm serious. PAUL: Marry you? Yeah. PAUL: Don't even say that word around me. Makes me tremble. What kind of marriage would that be anyway? Eric says it's just like going to a judge, getting a piece of paper signed, so that when you come see me on conjugal visits, I can have sex in jail. It's like a convent up there, and I will never last without sex. I have to have sex. BARRY: This exclusive tape... That boyfriend of hers is a rat. He sold her out. Well, Dad, that rat is my best friend. I guess so. [LAUGHING] Mar... The timing couldn't have been more perfect! What a sleazebag! [BOTH LAUGHING] JOEY: Maybe you should go kiss him, huh? [KNOCKS] Mary Jo, Mike. Fred. Come on in. Thanks for coming today. Marty. MIKE: Hey, Marty. Mary Jo. Eye looks a lot better. Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, it's healing. That's good. That's real good. So are you gonna indict Joey? I don't know how things got this bad. The truth is, Mary Jo, I always wanted to do the best for you. I like you very much. MIKE: We know that. That's fine. Now, what exactly did you gentlemen want to tell us? Look, we know how you feel about the fact that you were raided, but we had to continue with this investigation. Allegations were made against Joe by Amy. We had to look into them. Look, are you gonna arrest my husband, yes or no? [♪♪♪] [FOOT TAPPING] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [METAL DETECTOR BEEPS] Well? Mar? It's over! [CHUCKLES] It's over! Oh, Mary Jo! Oh, Mary Jo. Thank you, Lord, thank you. Mike... Come here, guys. Congratulations, Joe. Good. You doing good? Yeah, I'm doing good too. [LAUGHS] Mary Jo, it's finally over. Yeah, well... It's almost all over. Your Honor, I realize what I did was terribly wrong. If I could put my hands on her face and make it go away, I would. The truth is, is I did something that was awful. But it is also the truth that I had an affair with a married man and that Joey knew of my intentions towards his wife, and he encouraged me. And I cannot and will not take that back for the sake of harmony. But once again... I am very sorry for my actions. Thank you, Your Honor. I am ready to be sentenced. Amy Fisher, your act on May 19th was not impulsive. For months, you stalked Mary Jo Buttafuoco like a wild animal stalks its prey. Prior to that, you attempted to induce young men in return for money and sexual favors to kill Mary Jo Buttafuoco. And on May 19th, motivated by lust and passion, you were a walking stick of dynamite with the fuse lit. And with the passage of time, you may be able to put the events of that day behind you, but for Mary Jo Buttafuoco, you have created a lifetime of unrelenting mental and physical agony. For some people, you have become a media celebrity. But to this court, you are a disgrace to yourself, your family and to society. And you deserve no less than the maximum sentence that I can impose by law. Amy Fisher... you are hereby sentenced to a maximum term of 15 years and a minimum term of five years. You will be delivered to the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for the term of your sentence. This court is adjourned. [GAVEL BANGS] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
