(screams) (groans) Raquelita, listen to me... ...help me, please. The police are following me. No, no way, fuck this fuck this guy and his little friend! -Raquelita, don't be like that. -Good evening, ladies. Don't worry, this is a police check. (screams) Have you seen or heard anything strange, out of the ordinary? Could you be a little more specific? What if they've seen, heard anything strange... ...out of the ordinary? Chi! (exhalation) (groan) (groan) Is this lady mentally retarded this lady or what? Don't talk to my sister like that. (scream) And who the the fuck let you in? Calm down, sweeten your tone of voice. -I'm a police officer. -It's good enough for me, and besides... Don't talk to me like that, you ordinary brat. Neither do you, you old bastard! (scream) (explosion) -What was that? -Like a bomb, right? 'Uta, Panfilo! Now what did this asshole do? (breakage / glass) Ah! (indistinct voices) Thank you. (screams) Panfilo! (screams) Thank you. (engine / car) I already know what we are going to do. -Dale to Roxana's house. -Are you an idiot or what? If we already have the money, let's go. I'm not going to be a fugitive all my life, huh? Besides, I have to clean up my image with her. What will she think of me? That old morning won't even remember you. You didn't see how we danced, did you? Oh, Arturo... ...if she danced with you it's because she must have been drunk. Dale to Roxana's house. (environment / street) Panfilo! Here, commander. Panfilo! Pamphilus... ...it was you, wasn't it, asshole, eh? It was you, wasn't it? What a sin I'll be paying with you! Panfilo, let's go. Use this mother, it doesn't hurt. You're really going to kill me, motherfucker, let's go. Come on, move! Use your head, Panfilo, for God's sake! (singing / crickets) (gasps) Can you tell me how we're going to find Roxana... ...in this case? You think I don't know the place where I'm going to live? (singing / crickets) Come, come, come. (exhaling) It is closed. (exhaling) There is a key. What day was Roxana born? (inhalation) (exhalation) What are you doing? Sht! (singing / crickets) (creaking / door) Sht! (squeak / door) (chirping / crickets) (creaking / wood) (indistinct voices) (shout) Are you sure it's this way? Shut up! It's just that you always come up with... Here it is. See? I told you. Come on. Sht! Ah! (squeak / armchair) Sht, sht, sht! (scream) Listen to us, please please, listen to us. We didn't kidnap your daddy... ...a gentleman hired us to play a joke on him. You think that if we were guilty... ...we would have ...we would have come in here, to your room? I know that you will believe us. We are innocent... ...and you're going help us, okay? Sht, sht, sht. (inhalation) Sht, sht, sht! They kidnapped my dad? (gasps) Mothers! Ah! Did you see, you bastard? Did you see the mess you made? No shit! You get out of here, get out of here, get out of here! Yes, my commander. But now you're fucked... ...and you accompany me until those two bastards show up. Yes, my commander, don't worry. And let's go before the police the police come and find us. (sirens / patrols) Wait for me. Mom... ...can you come to my room quickly, please? (singing / crickets) What happened, m'hijita? Are you feeling sick? And these young people who are they? Sit down. Easy, ma, they're... ...two friends... ...and they come to us to talk about something. Regina Robledo... ...a housewife addicted to pills... ...that to wake up, than to sleep... Pacheca! Good morning. You are aware that we have to get there... ...before this lady calls the police, right? -I know, my commander. -Enton's, where are we? It's just that they remodeled the city and... ...I don't recognize, my commander. I'm going to kill you, Panfilo. And you are here because you are innocent. Did I understand correctly? Yes, mom. And what can I get you? We need to know... ...if your husband has any enemies. (gasps) I'll be right back. He's going to call the police. My mom has a face, but she's not stupid. Come on. Come. Ouch! This is your daddy... ...this is me... ...and this is Mauricio Tavárez. The three of us live in Durango... ...for a while and... ...Mauricio and your dad... ...wanted me. Well, that never stopped them them from remaining friends. Some years ago years ago Mauricio... ...proposed a business to your father. So the deal went wrong... ...and Mauricio went to to jail... ...but he always accused my husband... ...of cheating on him and of having him hidden in Durango... ...a treasure worth millions. (exhalation) The worst of all is that Mauricio... ...escaped from jail a week ago. I was worried very much... ...but Antonio didn't gave it any importance. May I have the picture, mother-in-law? If we put mustache and glasses... ...I'd swear he's the person who hired us. So if Mauricio believes that the treasure... ...is in Durango... ...he must have taken don Antonio there. And the commando who kidnapped him, was also from the north. We are going to Durango. We have to save our honor... ...and your dad. Let's get it over with. Hey, guys... ...when you get Durango... ...look for Jeronimo Natage... ...at the bar "La Diligencia". Jerónimo is Roxana's Roxana's godfather. Natage? Means "long teeth" in Apache... teeth" in Apache... ...sometime told me about it. Fangirl. (engine / car) (engine / truck) Come here, come here! Bite me! Steady! Steady! -Good morning. -Good morning. Excuse me. -Madam, good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. I am Commander Porfirio Narvaez. Would you leave us alone for a a moment, please, miss? Madam... ...I have some very bad news for you... ...your husband was kidnapped last night. Hey, I knew that. What do you mean, you already know? Yes, I found out a little while ago. He found out a little while ago, my commander. But you haven't told anyone, have you? He didn't call the police, nor the press... ...or any other corporation? No. Because you will understand that this has to be given... ...a very discreet discretion, it's obvious. -Yes, commander. -Good. My mouth is sealed. Very well, madam. And tell me... What else do you know? What you surely think... ...are to blame, are not. -Ah, they're not? -No. You don't say? -They're very good boys. -Ah, they're good boys? One of them even fell in love with my Roxana. Ah. How inattentive I am! They don't like lemonade, some cookies? Yes, of course. No, ma'am, we're on duty, thank you. No, ma'am, we are on duty, thank you. Uh, ma'am, tell me... ...how do you know all this? They were here in the night. Here? (trills / birds) Oh, are they all right? Let's see. Oh, are you all right? Yes. Ouch! (exhalation) So that's how was everything, madam? Mjm. -And that's why they left? -Yes... ...but right now I ask Roxana ...to bring them back to her. Where to? Roxana never goes out without her cell phone. Ah, ah, what a good idea, madam, please call her! Goodbye, Roxana. Take care of yourself, sweetheart. My cell phone! (ringing / phone) (bell / phone) Wait, wait, wait, wait! it's my mom! Well, ma? M'hijita, what do you think? Commander Narvaez is here... commander Narvaez... ...and as he is such a such a decent man... ...a real professional... Mom... -...told me that... -Okay, wait for me... -Okay, wait for me... Yes, m'hijita. Okay, wait for me, ma, wait for me a little while. There's a commander in my house. The commander coincided with Mauricio Tavárez ...at the restaurant... ...in other words, they're in cahoots... ...it is a trap to to catch us and if we get caught... ...we're going to get at least thirty years in jail, Oscar. -Why do they want to catch us? -To blame us. -Enton's what do we do? -I know... ...Roxana to tell her mom that we're coming her mother that we are going there... ...and that way we can beat her time to go to Durango. Ma, are you still there? Yes, my love, did you convince them? Mjm, yes, we're on our way. That's good... ...so I'll make them a little coffee for when they arrive. (clearing throat) Thank you, ma. Bye. -Can I come with you? -No, no, no. -What? -Please. Why not? Why not? If I go back to my house... ...that commander is going start asking me questions... ...and who knows what he's going to get the truth out of me. -Do you want me to do something? -No. Then take me away. Well, let's go then. -Come on. -What, where are you going? If we leave in that cart, they'll catch us in 5 minutes. Trolley? On the other hand, if we leave in the Mari, no one will notice. Besides, I can't leave her leave her abandoned here. Who is Mari, what are you talking about? La Mariachera, Oscar's car. -Sht. -Ah. -La Mari. -That? Yes, get in. -I'm sorry. -But... (gasp) You would have washed it. (engine / car) (lock / doors) How nice. (inhalation) Don Antonio! My... ...dear friend. My... ...soul brother! Which is the same thing... ...the asshole... ...that betrayed me! (groaning) (sobbing) (footsteps) Vanilla... ...and then you make the figurines, put them in the oven and that's it. He's a policeman, not a baker! No baker! They've already taken long enough, madam... ...not even if they were in the village. They must have kidnapped their daughter too! Ah! (vibration / phone) Good? Find them. Allow me. Let me. How much vanilla of vanilla? Find them even if you have have to go to hell itself. I can't leave the city... ...but I can send the Federals to... Don't be an asshole, for God's sake, think! I don't want anyone else more involved in this. Look, calm down, okay? Let's just calm down. Look, it's very simple, very simple, master... ...or you start looking for them right now... ...or you forget about the five melons I offered you! Did you hear me, you fucking bastard? It's good. (inhalation) (gasps) -Panfilo! -Yes, my commander. -We're going to Durango. -To Durango? Yes, to Durango. Fucking kids, the devil's going to the devil is going to appear. Hey, and if they are are actors? Yes, we are actors. In fact, I started at a very young age. I remember that as a child I used to say poems by López Velarde. Do you know the one about Suave Patria? Mhm, no. -No? -Nnn. In fact, that's why Arturo named it Suave Patria... ...to our theater company. How many people are in your theater company? -Well, just Oscar and me. -Ah, you two? Yes. Right. Soft Homeland, 'tá father the name. Soft... Would you like to listen to the poem? Uh-huh. Yes? Okay. (clearing throat) "I who only sang of the exquisite... ...score of the intimate decorum... ...I raise my voice today to the middle of the forum... ...in the manner of the imitating tenor... ...the guttural bass modulation... ...to cut from the epic a slice". Orale, it's super cool! -But for...? - "I will sail... ...by the deep waves... ...I'll say an epic mute... ...the Fatherland. The Fatherland is impeccable and diamond-like. Soft Homeland, you are worth... ...by the river of the virtues of your womanhood... ...and a throne as a rattle... ...the allegorical allegorical straw road". (exhalation) Did you like it? (squeak / suspension) He did like it. He fell asleep almost at the end. You know that if we don't get to Durango, what will happen, right? I'm going to start to get nervous... ...and if I get nervous... You do know what happens, don't you? -Yes, my commander. -What is it? Everything begins to be worth mother, my commander. Oscar, can you stop, please? Yes. You said this was a good shortcut, where are we going, Panfilo? To Durango, my commander. Durango is wider, as without trees... ...and this is full of trees. There's a stretch missing, my commander. Ouch! Ah! (yawning) Wake up, won't you? (yawning) It's nice here, isn't it? (sound / water) (wind) (gasps) Let's go. (sound / water) (gasps) (wind) (noise / urine) What? Nothing. (noise / closing) (engine / car) And how in which movies or novels have they been in? Because I haven't, I haven't seen them in anything. We are more of a theater person. Ah, ok. Arturo and I started to put on a show... ...but it's an action show. This is an assault, motherfuckers! We started to do it in the trucks... ...in the subway, in the Zócalo... ...very interactive with the people. Give me everything, wallet, watch, anything! Judicial police, put the gun down, you bastard! (gunshot) Together we are the Suave Patria Suave Patria Theatrical Group. No, and people loved it, eh? Let's go! Come on, asshole! Come on, asshole! How did you come up with that? No, I didn't think of it, it was Arturo's idea. (exhalation) Don't you dare, my life is super boring! Promise me that one day you'll take me to do something like this. I'd be soft... ...I mean, if there's no argument with Arturo. Mhm? (engine / car) How much time is left? A couple of stalls more, my commander. Why are you being an asshole? We have eighteen booths. Where is Durango? Chingada Madre! Eh? Over there ahead, my commander. I'm going to kill you, you bastard. (engine / car) *I'm going to conquer you... *...at once I tell you... *...well, I've had enough... *...that you want me as a friend...* *...nothing more. *I'm going to conquer you... *...at once I inform you...* *...for I already understood that if I don't do it...* *...I'm upset. *I'm going to melt... *...all your ice. *I'm gonna get... *...to make you jealous. *When you don't have me... *...by your side... *...then you will know... *...that I've made it. *I'm going to conquer you... *...at once I warn you. *I declare that I love you...* *...and it's with open heart. *I'm going to conquer you... *...once and for all. *We're going to have... *...the most talked about of weddings. *I'm going to provoke... *...so much envy... *...and it will be envy of the good kind *...and it will be envy... *...and until death... *...do us part... *...shall be a blessing... *...also condemnation. (* * ) (singing / crickets) (engine / car) I think we have to change our clothes. I look pretty good like this. Hold on. (exhaling) Let's see, that one, that one! (english song) -Looking good? -You look cool. Yo, what, Oscar? Arturo, you taught me that an actor prepares himself. I'm going in like this. I don't recommend it. Why don't you wear this? How do you think I'm going wear that, Oscar? (screams) Bravo! (whistles) (indistinct voices) What can I get you? Excuse me, are you Geronimo Natage? From whom? From her goddaughter, Roxana Robledo. Just a moment. Thank you. (singing / crickets) (engine / car) -Godfather! -Roxana? Ah! How you have grown! Godfather! Tell me, m'hijita, what brings you here? I came with my friends, we have a problem... ...and you are the only one who can help us. Come. -This is Oscar. -Good evening. Nice to meet you. -And this is Arturo. -Much pleasure, godfather. Come, my little daughter... ...inside we can talk more calmly. Ramon... ...attend here the gentlemen. Yes, sir. You may proceed. The Apache Geronimo... ...is the manager of a center... ...for young youngsters. An Apache... ...very exemplary. (humming) (squeak / door) Carlos... ...what's going on? (laughter) "What's going on?" It happens that everyone has its price... ...even Carlitos. Verdá, my son? One day... ...Mauricio and Antonio started... ...to plan a business together. They spent hours and hours in the office. It was supposed to be... ...the biggest deal of their lives... ...but I knew that something wasn't going to go right... ...and something went wrong. (humming) Nobody knows exactly what happened. Your father left with you... ...and with Regina for the city... ...leaving me an errand. And what was that errand, godfather? To take care of some... ...precious stones... ...that soon he would soon come back for them... ...but he was late. The commander! -Watch out, Panfilo. -Which commander? Ouch! Turn around, turn around! Good evening. Good night. Have you causally seen these two guys around here? Have you seen them? No, sir. Let's go. Suspect, my commander. Suspicious! Fucking stoner! (exhaling) Sir... Sir, there's a police the police are looking for you. Oh, mom! Ih! (exhalation) I'm going to kill her! Arturo, Arturo! Get over there. (indistinct voices) -Hear me! -What? Why did you grabbed my buttocks? What buttocks, you fucking little bitch? You had to be, chilango! -Chilango? -Chilango? *Seven thirty seven comin' out of sky.* *Oh! Won't you take me down...* *...to Memphis on a midnight ride, I wanna move.* *Playin' in a travelin' band, yeah.* *Well, I'm flyin' cross the land...* *...tryin' to get a hand... *...playin' in a travelin' band.* *...playin' in travelin' band.* 1561 01:09:38,409 --> 01:09:41,812 baggage gone, oh, well.* *Come on, come on, won't you get me to my room...* *...I wanna move.

Someone got. * It was you, you bastard! *State militia, wanna move. *Playin' in a travelin' band.* (whistling) I, I'm driving, I'm driving. *We'll, I'm flyin' cross the land, trying' to...* *...get a hand, playin' in a travelin' band. in a travelin' band.* Oh, godfather, godfather, sorry... ...we destroyed your bar! It's all right, Venadita... ...tomorrow after mass they will come to repair the damage. (howling) (scream) (shout out) (chant) (shout) It is a very common ritual among the Apaches. (scream) (wind) (noise / fire) (exhalation) And what did they believe? People create their own myths. If I don't dress like this... ...and I do these things... ...because the bar would always be empty. Not an Apache ritual? Godfather, really my dad had nothing to do with it... ...with Mauricio has gone to jail? Well, look, m'hijita... ...that business that they planned together... ...fell apart... ...Mauricio ended up in jail ...and I want to suppose that your father... ...is innocent. "Suppose." (singing / crickets) With permission. Roxana... Roxana! Don't worry, we're going find your dad. And what are you are you laughing at, you bastard? Arturo! What I don't understand is how my dad got into this. You'll see that he'll come out of it all right. Such a good person who cares... ...for the singing children, nothing bad can happen to him. (exhalation) Hey, you and Oscar get along get along great. How did you two meet? Well, some years ago some years ago, Oscar... ...I had just arrived to Mexico City from Durango... ...the Mari broke down in front of my house. in front of my house. I remember that... ...it was very cold that day. No! I remember that it was getting hot. (Arturo:) Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I was coming on a beautiful black bike that he just bought. (Oscar:) Wasn't that when you were working as...? (Arturo:) Will you shut up? I realized that Oscar needed help... ...he had the hood of his car open... ...and I decided to stop to help him. (noise / fall) Arturo... ...I was the one who helped you last. (groan) So you helped him? helped him? How cute! Well, he also helped me helped me too because he left me... ...sleep at his house that night, right? Yes, because he didn't have a place to sleep. Ah, ok. And there we started to become friends and... ...and that's when Suave Patria was born. How cool! Oscar, isn't that is not my bandana? I don't know, do you want it? Oh no, but it looks it looks super good! No, you can have it. (laughter) Thank you. Hey, what else do you do? Look, I get up, I take a bath, I get dressed... ...and I'm already out of work. Oh, yes! May I have a moment, Rox? Come. It was already, wasn't it? -You've been what? -What do you mean "of what"? Of being a show-off, wanting to to look good with her. I'm not being lucid, I was chatting. (noise / phone) Chin, I lost again! What's wrong with you, m'hijita? You look like a little pot without water... Mhm! ...a little piece of candle that is going out. (exhalation) I would be able to give everything to have... ...a friendship like they have. But you're telling him the wrong things, that's not how we met. Well, I tell them the way I want to. I just ask you... ...that you respect the relationship between Roxana and me. What relationship, güey? Tomorrow I want to see you... ...fresh as a drink of water in the desert. Good night, m'hijita. Good night, godfather. Oh, yes, so... Well, I'm just going to tell you I'm going to tell you something... ...I saw it first. "I saw it first." I'm going to ask you for the last time. Where are these pair of assholes? I already told you I don't know, sir. Or you tell me... ...or I'll put you in the for being a chunky guy. Drop the soup or I'll break you. (call / door) M'hijita... ...tomorrow we go to the bridge of Hojuela... ...there they are the famous... ...precious stones. (snoring) (opening / door) Good morning. Come here, you fucking little bitch. Come here, come here! Ouch! -You're getting on my nerves, come on! -Ouch! Oscar, wake up. Now! (crying) Come here. No! (crying) Shut up! Shut up! (screams) (gunshots) (screams) Panfilo, what are you doing? (screams) Stupid! You fool! Pamphilus, you idiot! Hey, hey, hey! They... ...there are only two of them. We'd better split up and listen to me well. See you at the bridge of Hojuela... ...which is about ten kilometers from here... ...I'll be waiting for you there. That way you come out to a dirt road. dirt road, follow it! Good luck. Let's go. (exhaling) (scream) (gasps) Better? Ready, ready to to kill, my commander. "To kill", but me with courage. Here, rinse, take off. Hello, princess. Tás bonita, chamaca. Eh? You're pretty, shut up. Shut up! Mmm! (crying) (imitation / crying) Squeaky! (gasps) But how stubborn! How stubborn you are really, Antonio. Just tell me... ...tell me where are the stones... ...and this afternoon I'll return you with Regina, now. (vibration / phone) (gasps) Look, some little friends... ...sent me this for you. How do you see? My daughter has nothing nothing to do with it! Then where are the fucking stones, you bastard? Where are they? Tell me... Where are they, you bastard? (scream) (sobs) Are you sure it's this way? Yes. It's just that we should never have to have left her alone. It was your idea for her to to fall asleep in the Mari. Because I know you. One of those times I get careless and you wake up with her. You don't know me know me so well. You think I don't realize that you want to take her away from me? Let's look for it better, right? Instead of being with your fucking childish jealousy. Don't talk to me like that, fucking Oscar. If anyone is worried about what's happening to her, it's me. That if you hadn't accepted that little money to make that... ...little joke, we wouldn't be in this mess. And do you know why I did it? They were going to run us the next day. I did it so you wouldn't starve to death. You're hanging on to the performance. Don't you realize that you suck? You're no good as an actor. Stand up for yourself, man. Aren't you going to defend yourself? Defend yourself! (engine / tractor) (gasps) (screams) (gasps) From here on, the theatrical group... ...Suave Patria... ...is unraveling... ...fuck it! (engine / car) (cry) Come on, get down, fucking escuincla, now! And orale! (screams) Maurizio! (screams) Daughter, daughter! Sht, sht! There it is, Mauricio. Sht, sht, sht, sht, sht, sht! (crying) Asseyez-vous, mademoiselle. Welcome, Roxana. (crying) (humming) The thing here... ...is very easy... ...simple. Or your dad tells me where are the fucking stones... ...on the count of three... ...or I blow his his brains out in front of you. No! Let's see... One... (scream) ...two... (scream) It's on the bridge, on the bridge! Hojuela Bridge... ...Jerónimo told me, on a bridge. Bridge! Geronimo! Yes... ...but don't kill him. What a good daughter you have, Antonio... ...in every in every way, eh? Exemplary! Andiamo tutti. Andiamo tutti. (laughter) (creak / door) What did you do? (singing / crickets) Oscar... ...here! (exhalations) Oscar... (gasps) (exhalation) What happened to them? -Nothing. -Nothing. I'm a brute, but not an asshole. Ah, I'm sure it was because of Roxana! How did you know? Because this is how it all begins everything, by women! Yes, but there would be no problem if the so-called friends... ...don't want to to run the errand. I don't want you to bring anything down. -Oh, you don't want me to get off? -You fall in love in two minutes. -What do you know? -Ya, ya, ya, ya! (dialect / indigenous) We have to ally ourselves. Now the important thing is to recover... ...the famous stones to settle this matter. And where are they, godfather? I'm not your best man, mhm? That the order I I kept it in there. So, you told lies to Roxana? And what did you want? It won't be for my sake that she to know who her father is. Are we? Pray, shake hands. Let them shake hands! And wait for me here. Ah... ...I found your wagon, I left it there. And now let go your little hands, right? Thank you. Was it worth it? See where you got us, daddy... ...and all for the fucking money. (slurped) (honking) Mauricio, this is a great favor you do me. Man. Point them at me, the one who moves you'll melt his holster. What's up, Porfirio? They told me you're a judicial police of the Federal District. (laughter) (slurping) Even if you were hiding in the ass of the world, you bastard... ...I was going to find you. What did you say? "This fucking escuincle pendejo, I've already fucked him". Get down, motherfucker! Get off, you bastard! Come on, Panfilo. -Why me, my commander? -That you come! Get off, damn you! Walk. Walk, motherfucker! Move it, motherfucker! Gustavo Solis, boss of the mafia... ...finally settled accounts. (closing / door) (engine / truck) (noise / stick) (wind) Follow me. Take it easy, boys... ...it's all right. And these monkeys... ...want war? Show time! (scream) Let's see... You know it, eh? I know very well that know it, eh? (shout) And you know what what I want. Drop it. What are you doing, you fucking Apache motherfucker? No! What I should have done a long time ago. Drop it... Nooo! ...or I send the stones to hell. To hell with her, she she's going, you bastard! Uh! (crying) (gasps) (gasps) How unmanly you are! (gasps) (sobbing) (scream) (groaning) (sobbing) Are you all right? Have a nice day! (engine / truck) (exhalation) (humming) Oscar. So what, my Artur? Stop me, I said Oscar, ay! Ramon... ...stop rocking and rolling and get to work! And you, Antonio... ...come here. -That's the way it's going to be. -Tell Arturo to come. Roxana speaking. Come. And things came to an end. And so the girl said goodbye to her lovers... ...and left with her handsome... ...to spend a real life. So... ...leaving behind his adventure with Oscar and Arturo. They... ...they returned to the big city... ...to do what they had always wanted... ...to do in life. (screams) Calm down, cal...! Ah! What, what, what? Asshole! Why do you always always go out of the text? At what point did I tell you take the old lady hostage? -The lady was laughing. -No, she wasn't laughing... ...she had no teeth. I thought I wanted to be part of the show. Part of the show! Well, let's see, now. Let's see, we have casting, ok? Concentrate. -Okay. -Ok? Let's go. (exhalation) (exhalation) (squeak / door) (screams) -No what no, no what no? -We stay, we stay! We are staying! See? It was a matter of time, Oscarito. That's what I told you, that's what I told you! Whoo! Ujuuu! Per me, it's just that now I did convince you, didn't I? You convinced me, you were very good, very convincing. Behind every man who succeeds... ...there is always a happy woman.
