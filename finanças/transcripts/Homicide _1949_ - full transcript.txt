According to the last estimated figure, Los Angeles County has a population of 3,693,493 people. It also accommodates several million tourists each year. Three railroad lines, five major airlines, over ten bus lines and a number of ocean-going vessels bring them in and take them home. Drawn by magic, they come to bathe at fabulous beaches, to see how movies are made, to race their horses, to frolic at nearby resorts, to collect autographs. They come to stare, to study, to steal, to love, to murder or to be murdered. Every eight minutes a murder is attempted in the United States. Every seventy-two minutes somebody is actually murdered. By the year's end there is an average of 7,500 known criminal homicides. What's a homicide? Murder. The killing of a human being by another human being. A disgruntled gangster decides that the only way to eliminate competition is to get rid of his rival permanently. He waits for his victim to come home and shoots him dead. That's murder. An extremely jealous gent in a fit of revenge, because the lady he loves has no use for him kills her, so that no one else will have her. That's murder. A thug pulls a stick-up in a store run by an elderly couple. When the old man doesn't respond to the gunman's demands, the guy bashes his head in with a gun. That's murder. A man grabs a quick drink at a fruit juice stand on a highway. That's not murder, but it's going to be. Thanks. Is this the Webb ranch? That's right. The Labor Bureau sent me down. They thought maybe you may need some extra help picking. Well, Mr. Webb does the hiring and firing. You will have to see him about it. Is he around? You'll find him a mile past the lemon groves. He's plowing up a new plot. - Where's the lemon groves? - Past the orange groves. That's a big help. Just turn around. Keep walking straight. You can't miss it. Thank you. What's your hurry? Listen, fellas, I don't want no trouble. You work here? No, I was just gonna hit up the old man for a job. You live around these parts? What's your name? Brad Clifton. Why? Just being neighborly. Hey, just a minute. Oh, lay off, fellas, I got enough grief as it is. I didn't see nothing, I didn't hear nothing. What if you did? We just had an accident. That's all. Can't do nothing to stop accidents, can you? Well, we can't just leave him lay there like that, you know what I mean? Wouldn't be the right thing to do. Somebody's gotta report it. Listen fellas, I don't wanna get mixed up in this. Oh, wait a minute, you wouldn't let a friend down, would you? It's a cinch. The old man got crocked, fell off the tractor and hit his head on a boulder. It was an accident and you saw the whole thing. - I know what's bothering our friend. - What? He figures somebody would think he knocked off the old man. You know, a friend asks for a job, the old man says no dice, our friend gets mad, loses his temper, knocks the old guy's head on a rock. Sure that's what they'd think if we were to say we saw him doing it while we were driving by. But, naturally, we wouldn't do a thing like that. I didn't do anything to you guys. Please, let me go. Well, I figure people's got to help each other out in times like these. You help me out, I help you out. Know what I mean? You report the accident, I make up for losing your job. No, I don't want it. Please, let me go! There, now, don't you worry about a thing, friend. If... things don't work out just right, we'll be around. Yeah, we'll be around. In fact, we'll be so close you could practically reach out and touch us. But don't let it get you. Don't worry about a thing. Everything will be all right. And did you actually see Mr. Webb drinking? No, not exactly. Then, how do you know he was drinking? Pardon me, uh... what did you say? How do you know Mr. Webb was actually drinking? I saw the bottle when he fell, it was next to him. I could smell the liquor and— You say you saw the whole thing from the lemon groves, right? Yes, I... I saw this whole thing from the lemon groves. What time was it? I don't know, I haven't got a watch. I guess it was close to high noon. After you saw Mr. Webb fall, what did you do? Do you have to keep asking me the same questions? I told you once before. Don't get smart, young man. Answer the question. I went over to see if he was hurt. And he was dead when you got there? I guess so. Was anybody else around when this happened? Seems to me that's a simple thing to answer. There was or there wasn't. There's no two ways about it. - I'm just thinking. - There's nothing to think about. He thinks we were trying him for murder the way he acts. I'm doing the best I can. Didn't I come here to report it? Couldn't just let him lie out there. All we wanna know is was anyone else around? No. You're sure that there was no one around that could see it? I didn't say that. I said I didn't see anyone. That's all I know. - Anything else? - No. Is there anything the jury wants cleared up? No questions. That being the case, it's in your lap now. Take your time weighing the evidence. If you've got any questions, speak up. Got a question? We've reached our verdict. No grass grows under your feet, does it? Okay, shoot, what's the verdict? Accidental death due to drinking. Well, that does it. Thanks for the cooperation. I'll turn all the papers over to you in the morning, George. That'll be all, Mr. Clifton, we won't need you any further. You lied, boy. I don't know why, but you lied. There he is. Nothing to it. I'll be back before morning. - Hi. - How far you're going, bud? - Heading to L. A. - Good, hop in. Homicide. Lieutenant Meisner. Yeah. Wait a minute, lady, you're going too fast. I can't understand a word you're saying. - This is Mrs. Brucker. - Who? This is Mrs. Brucker. I'm the manager of the Templeton Hotel on East 6th Street. - Got that? - Yeah. Looks like we got a suicide down here. Better send a man over. - Templeton Hotel? - That's right. East 6th Street. Brother, don't break a leg, he ain't in any hurry. Who is up? With your luck, you should've retired ten years ago. Unfortunately, fate chose to smile unkindly on me. All my pigeons are either on relief or they're cops. Economically, it amounts to the same thing. Meisner, do you always have to look like a starving vulture? Gin. Why didn't I stay in Canada? I wonder about that myself. Think of all the money you could have saved. Besides, if you had to be a cop, why didn't you do it up brown? Become a Mountie. Lots of tradition, pretty red uniform, ride your own horse, tea every afternoon at 4:00. - That's so bad. - Did I say it was bad? I was just wondering why you chose to come down here and make my life miserable instead. - Seriously? - Seriously. Well, the Mounties wouldn't have me. I wasn't smart enough. - Speaks well for all of us. - Well, you asked for it. Besides, there was another small reason for them to turn me down. It should be interesting. They held my age against me. - How old were you? - 11 and a half exactly. Oh, very funny! 20 and 18 is 38. I'm out of all games you're placed on too. Okay, put it on the sheet. Let's go on our living. Your debt has now reached four figures. Sure you're going cheap about me, let's go. Mankind is not only decadent, it is completely void of the basic considerations. I say that if we have to contend with murder, it should be confined to the waking hours. Don't work yourself up, this is just a suicide. Okay, boys he's all yours. I bet you give away icicles in the winter, Rembrandt. Don't be a bitter little man. Go away, break it up. What do you think it is, a sideshow? How about some coffee? No, thanks. I wanna stick around for a bit. What for? He's not sold on the suicide angle. Since when? Okay, go ahead. I'll see you back at headquarters. Junior, you're making camels out of cloud formations. This is a simple little case of suicide, nothing more. Am I right, doc? You boys get paid for the second guessing, but that's the way it looks to me. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Hey, O'Brian, where's the old biddy who runs this hatchery? - Coming, lieutenant. - Okay. I'm done, I'm finished. Not that I'm choosing sides, do you understand? But I think you're reaching a little, lieutenant. All right, I'm reaching. Here's what I get, - One, there's no suicide. - No, not terribly uncommon. Two, there's not a shred of identification on the guy. Maybe he liked to travel light. Three, tucked in his money belt are five crisp $100 bills. Well, no comeback on that, huh? Four, a tattoo in his arm indicates an ex-Navy boy. I know, I know, no Navy men would pull such a sloppy job of knot tying. Well, look at it and look at that. I can't see how a man is going to be particular about craftsmanship when he's getting ready to take the long voyage. Tickle in my eyes! It's not a case of being particular, it's a habit, it's second nature. Well, maybe this guy was a rugged individualist, maybe he didn't like the way the Navy made him tie knots. Ha ha ha! All right, wise guy, riddle me this. You are a Navy boy, see, and you've had enough of living, well, what are you gonna do about it? Whip yourself up a real nice hangman's noose and end it with a broken neck like that? or make yourself a mish-mosh like this and slowly be strangled to death. He's got something there. Well, not much I admit. Enough to make me curious. Personally, I think you like to earn your money the hard way. You go back to the office and check up on these serial numbers through Navy headquarters. Maybe you'll dig up some information. Just for laughs. That's right, when you need a laugh, stick close to a detective or beat your wife. Ha ha ha! - Gone, huh? - Yeah. - Come on in, will you, mother? - What do you want? You keep a daily guest register, don't you? Well, I— You're supposed to. The difference between people doing or not doing what they're supposed to is what keeps us in cigarette money. Boylan, do me a favor, will you? and get out of here. I'll check with you later. Okay, Mickey. Let's go, boys. So our dear departed friend wasn't registered, huh? What do you know about him? Ain't a nosy guy, he paid his rent in advance and that's all I ask. - How much rent? - A week's. A week's, huh? What time did he come in? Oh, about 9:30 or 10:00, somewhere around then. Did he say anything or do anything to indicate he was gonna commit suicide? No, he was the silent kind. Who has that next room? It's vacant. What about that one? Some new guy. I don't know his name. He ain't here? No, he ain't. Anybody know this guy? No, he's new around here. - Never saw the guy before. - Uh-huh. Did anybody hear anything, voices, arguments, fighting, anything like that? - I have a sound sleep. - Not a sound. Okay, go back to your rooms, the show's over. Let's move you, guys. Don't you hear well? Break it up. Break it up, go to bed. Well, mother, it seems I'm still on first base with two men out. Why don't you leave well enough alone? You're just causing me trouble. I was born near a glue factory. When I've got a notion, I gotta steam it off. Let's go and visit our next-door neighbor. He must be a pretty sound sleeper. Do you have a key? - That's funny. - What's funny? The fellow who rented it just said he just wanted some place to bunk for the night. Doesn't even have had much use. What time did this guy check-in? At the same time as the other fellow, maybe a little later. - For how long? - I told you, just for the night. I suppose he paid his rent in advance too. You're asking for a lot of grief, mother. Some reformer might come along with a yen for getting votes. A guy like that could crucify you. What does he look like? Who? Our mysterious roomer. I didn't pay much attention. Only thing... seems to me he was a little cleaner than most rents I get. The door lock is on the inside, did he have a key? When they need letting in, I'm the girl that does it. Lost 18 keys in the past six months. They lose them fast that I can get them made. You know, Ma, I think I'm ready to steal you a second. Now if you're thinking what I think you're thinking, you're gonna look awful silly if it turns out he just went to look for a drink. Bars closed hours ago Anyway, I'll stick around for a bit. Meantime you might as well catch up on your sleep. I won't need you anymore. Okie dokie. By the way, there wasn't something you wanted to tell me that you might've forgotten, was it? Stop pushing so hard, sonny. I called it just the way I saw it. Okay. Good night, mother. That's the nicest name anyone's called me in the last 10 years. Good night. Glorietta Springs Hotel. Now, what would anybody from Glorietta Springs be doing in a dump like this? Good morning. Get a good night's sleep? Yeah, great. How'd you know I was still here? I got ears like a hotel manager. Here, room service. Oh, thanks. The chicken didn't go home to roost, huh? You should know, you have the keys. Don't be so cocky. Maybe he showed and I gave him the big scramble with a sign. - Not you, mother. - Why not me? It's not your style. You're just corny enough to be honest and lazy enough to cause yourself trouble. Still harden on that hotel register? No, because I love you. Save it for your wife. I'm not married. You really think you got a case? Who knows? I'll drop you a postcard. - So long, ma. - So long. Oh, hello Mickey, what's new? Nothing except I'm starting playing hunches in my old age. Check this for prints, will you? And give this pellet a once-over. Sure. What do you wanna know? Whatever you can tell me. Anything that'll get me out of the kindergarten class. Okay, I'll see what I can do. - Do this go through the switchboard? - Yeah. Webster 4733, please. Cameron Match company? This is Lieutenant Landers, Los Angeles Homicide Division. I wanna get some information on the matches you put up for the Glorietta Springs Hotel. Yeah, what I wanna know is can these matches be obtained anywhere other than the hotel? You know uh... cigar counters, drugstores, bars... All right, Glorietta Springs Hotel. Yeah, hang on. How you doing? Nothing on this but a batch of smears. How about the pill? In a minute, only got two hands, you know. All right, take your time. Fritz, you know the Glorietta Springs, don't you? Only by reputation. I work for a living. It's a winter resort, isn't it? Yeah, they'll sell you a summer tan in the middle of December for a measly 40 bucks a day. Lots of swank. Yeah, that's what I thought. Yes. Exclusive design, huh? In other words, you can't get them anywhere else. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Ah, I saved myself a lot of trouble. This pill is nothing but saccharine. Oh, fine. How many million people in the United States use this stuff every day? I should have a nickel for every one. - You're a great help - Sorry, does it blow up your case? Maybe I didn't have one to start with. Well, keep on punching, kid. All right, I'll do that little thing, kid. So long. The man's name was Brad Clifton. He comes from Iowa. Nearest living relative is an aunt, last reported residing in Michigan. He served as a carpenter's mate aboard an aircraft carrier. Saw service in the Pacific. Was discharged October 1946. And for that I lost the night's sleep. Thanks, Boylan, I'll remember you in my will. I won't buy any yacht on that. Well, that's what I'm asking you, simple. I wanna keep the case alive. I don't think it's open and shut. Maybe you're right, Mickey, but personally I think you just like long odds. My sentiment is exactly. That should be enough to make me switch sides. Look, Moon, I'm not a glutton for work, but my corns are aching. I got a feeling about this. The new modern scientific detective. You can't fool him 'cause corns ache. Ah, such a big face! I'm funny about murder too, giving you the benefit of the doubt. After 16 years of this routine, I don't like people who play God any more than you do. But you need an angle to sell me, just a little one. Now, where do you start? Glorietta Springs. I wanna do some spade work. I'll dig up my angles. Is that all? Well, what more do you want? If there's one iota of doubt in your mind about this, it's your duty to— Now, don't start reading the book to me, Landers. You weren't even in this country when I was busy riding it. I'm sorry. Like I said, even if I thought the case was pat you'd be entitled to an opinion. I'd let you play around with it for a while, but Glorietta is out of your territory. Better send a report to Jackson County and let them pick it up. They haven't got a strength. Listen Moon, this is my baby. Nobody else wants to touch it. If I ring those guys in there, they'll just let it catch dust. In your own backyard, I'll let you run wild, but I can't send you around the country chasing shadows. Okay, chief. It's just that I felt kind of sorry for that gob. I'm sorry too, Mick, but we have to work it that way. There's nothing I can do about it. I'm on salary too. Sure I know. Well, thanks anyway. I'm off to bed, how about you, Mick? Wait a minute! There is something you can do for me. What about a leave of absence? I've got one coming. - Ha! Don't make me laugh. - I'm serious! So am I. Listen, I haven't asked for a favor for three years. Well, I'm asking for one now. I'm due a leave. Says who? I've got ulcers, I need a rest. Come on, Moon. This boy is really hopped up. Say, yours is a passion if I've ever seen one. - Well, do I get it or don't I? - No! - Why not? - Because, that's why. That's no reason. Come on, be a human for once in your life. Listen, the sooner you realize that you're not Sherlock Holmes, but just a plain ordinary detective trying to earn a living— What's that got to do with anything? All I'm asking for is a vacation. You've got a mind like a glass house. Who are you kidding? I'm not sending a man out on a case by himself. You aren't sending anyone anywhere except on a vacation: V A C — And I suppose it'll just be a coincidence if you end up in Glorietta Springs. What I do in my own time is my own business. All right, Dick Tracy, you got the leave. Thanks. Get this straight: you have no connection with the department, you're just plain John Doe citizen. Get into a scrape and it's your neck, is that clear? Like ice. Thanks again, Moon. Forget it. So long, Boylan. I'll be seeing you. Have a nice vacation, kid. What vacation? Such ambition. Do you think he's got anything? You read his report, what do you think? I think it's pretty hot in Glorietta this time of year. Pretty hot out down here this time of year, doesn't it? Oh, you get used to it after a while. I hope so. - Take Mr. Landers to 8A, please. - Yes. Oh, Mr. Landers I hope you have a pleasant stay. And don't forget to try our steam baths. Very healthful. I can hardly wait. - Want anything else, sir? - No, thanks. Thank you. - Oh, wait just a minute. - Yes. Does the name Clifton mean anything to you? - Clifton? - Yeah, Brad Clifton. No, sir, I'm afraid not. Okay, it's not important. Thanks anyway. Sure. Yes, sir? What'll it be? Something tall and cool. Surprise me. - Keep getting it down? - Trying pretty hard. You'll get used to it with time. I'll have something to look forward too. - Army? - That's right. What outfit? Signal Corps. - Soft life. - Don't you believe it. Ever try stringing up 60 miles of open copper lines through a jungle? How come you're bartending? Why not? Good hours, good pay, meet a lot of people and all I can hold for free. Good reason. Say, maybe you can help me out. Me? How? Oh, I'll tell you. - Well, my name is Landers - Andy. Look, Andy, I'm trying to locate a guy named Brad Clifton. - Did you ever hear of him? - Clifton? Clifton... No, I know most of the local color, but that name is not very familiar. - Friend of yours? - No, I never met him. It's this way. I'm with an insurance company, an investigator. This Clifton's aunt died and left him 5,000 and we can't find him to pay him the money. Maybe I could change my name. Hi, Jo. Hi, Andy. Here's your quota for the night. Thanks. - How about a little ginger ale? - Yeah. - Is your drink okay? - Yeah, fine. Sorry I can't help you out, but I'll try to keep my ears open. Excuse me. Hello. How do you do? Don't you run the cigarette concession? I work there. Maybe you will give me a little information. That's the desk clerk's job. A brick wall has to fall on you, doesn't it? Okay, I don't know what you're thinking, but this isn't just a routine. Does it look like I'm doubting you? Frankly, yes. Frankly, you're right. Mmm, insurance investigator. So? So I'm trying to find a man. That shouldn't be hard. The woods are full of them. - Of all kinds. - I just want one. Brad Clifton, do you know him? No. Have you ever heard of him? No. Okay, thanks. That's all I wanted to know. Sorry if I bothered you. Is it really important? Is what really important? Finding this man. Oh, no, I just came down here for laughs. Now, don't be so aggressive. It just points up your inferiority complex. What did you say his name was? Brad Clifton. There was a traveling salesman here last season, a Mr. Clinton. Oh, but his first name was Ernest. I don't suppose it could be the same person. - I don't suppose. - No. Guess I was right in the first place. What does he do, anyway? Nothing very romantic. He just came into some money, that's all, and I'm down here to see that he gets it. Have you checked around the village yet? That's next on my list. Well, if you need any help... Thanks, I think I can handle it. Would you have a nervous breakdown if I were to pay for your drink? Oh, I'm sorry. It's not that I'm prudish; it's just that men can be so... Aggressive? You should be a girl, it's no laughing matter. I'll bet. - Thanks for the drink, anyway. - Forget it. - I'll be seeing you. - Good-bye. - Good evening, gentlemen. - Hello Andy. - The usual? - That's right. Say, uh... is either of you fellas named Clifton by any chance? Not since we were here last. That's too bad. That fellow that just walked out, he's an insurance man with five grand in his jeans just waiting to find a fella by the name of Brad Clifton. You don't say. To your health, Mr. Foster. Skol. Have a seat, I'll be right with you. I didn't come in for a haircut, just a little information. My specialty. Sorry, son, got no use for insurance. I'm not selling any. I'm just an investigator, like a corporation detective. That's so? What are you investigating? A guy named Brad Clifton. He's supposed to live or work around here. Know anything about him? Well, you came to the right place. If anybody know him, it'd be me, right Lou? - That's right. - That's what I figured. Well, can you tell me where he works or lives or who his friends are? - You mean this fella Clifton? - Yeah. Ain't no such man around these parts. Yeah, but you just said– I said you came to the right place to find out. I didn't say I knew him. Oh, I see. Oh, yeah. Thanks, that's it. Good evening. Good evening. I'm trying to locate a man named Clifton, Brad Clifton. I've been told he lived in this neck of the woods. You haven't known anything about him? Nope. Never heard of him. I don't think he lived around here. Have you tried asking in the post-office? Mister, I've covered the whole town. Anyway, thanks for your trouble. It's no trouble. Oh, just one other thing. This is the only drugstore in town, isn't it? Yes, sir. I'd like to get a list of everyone who buys saccharine tablets from you. - Can you help me out? - No, I'm afraid I can't. You see, saccharine is not a prescription drug, so I have no reason to keep a record of sales. Oh, I see. Well, I was just counting on your memory. After all, it's a small town. Friend, if there's anything smaller than this town, it's my memory. All right, it was just a shot in the dark. - Thanks anyway. - You're welcome. Hi, Mr. Landers, How'd it go do? - Do I look happy? - No luck, huh? Not a nibble. If this guy Clifton was in town, he sure kept it a secret. Tell me something, what happens if you don't find him? They'll give me 20 lashes and send me to the Salt Mines. No, seriously. Seriously? I'll start looking somewhere else. That is if I still have a job. Maybe you're on the wrong track. What I mean is maybe you're looking in the wrong place. I'm hard to convince. Do you have any other bite of suggestions? Well, it could be a rancher. There are a lot of farms around here. Try again. The post office has no address listed for him. All right, what if he's just a ranch hand? Well, don't ranch hands ever get any mail? Some do and some don't. It depends. On what? Oh, whether they stay put long enough. Most of them keep on the move pretty steadily. A day's work here and a day's work there. Oh, it's worth looking into. You haven't got anything to lose. It's a lot of territory to cover. I don't think my feet will hold up. They won't have to if you're smart. Honey, if I was smart I'd have married a very rich girl about 85 years old. And you'd be sorry. Money isn't everything. No, but it helps in the clinches. At 85 who thinks about clinches? Okay, you win. Well, how do I save on shoe leather? Try checking the Farm Labor Bureau. They might have Clifton registered. You know, you're cute. You should see my baby pictures. Remind me to do something nice for you. - Oh, I'm easy to please. - Yeah? Yeah. What was that supposed to be? Just a sample of better things to come. Should I hold my breath? Suit yourself. I was wrong, something about 80 would be just your speed. Lady, you're pressing me. You know, I hope you find this Clifton fella, but not too soon, please. Honey, the odds are strictly in your favor. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. I'm looking for a guy named Brad Clifton. I think he may be registered down here. You got a job for him? Could be if I could locate him. All right, we'll take a look. - Say his name is Clifton. - Yeah. You run a farm? Thinking of buying one. Ain't a good time to buy. Never seen things so bad. Too much heat, not enough rain. It rains and floods. You get a good crop, the market's bad. I'm only looking. Barrry, Cleasco, Clifford... Clifton. Brad Clifton. Is that the guy you're looking for? That's my man. But you're too late. What do you mean? We've sent him over the Webb place a few days ago. Haven't heard anything of him since. Where is this Webb place? About a mile from the Glorietta Hotel. Straight down the highway, turn onto a dirt road. Okay, thanks. That's me. You're interested in this property? Maybe. Why is it for sale? Well, Mrs. Webb. She's the owner now, of course. She took her husband's accident pretty hard. They put her in the sanitarium. My instructions were to sell the place. So you don't have to worry about it being a lemon. Oh, I'm sure of that. You said it was an accident. Well, that's a polite way of putting it, but confidentially, the truth is the old man got loaded, fell off the tractor, hit his head on a rock and... That's been a pretty tall tractor. Or a pretty tall drink, huh? Yeah, if that don't affect the ranch none, still good-bye. Well, I had like a little time to think it over and I'll let you know. Sure, sure, no rush, take your time. Oh, by the way, if I do decide to buy it, I'll be looking for a good foreman. They told me there was a man here working for Webb, uh... I think his name was Clifton. Clifton? Well, if it's Clifton, I'm thinking he didn't have a chance to work for him. - Brad Clifton? - Sure, that's the man. He's the one that reported the accident. Oh, he didn't work here. No, no. If I'm not mistaken, he came out here to see about getting a job and that's how come he saw the accident. Oh, I see. Well, I guess the Labor Bureau got all mixed up, huh? Well, I'll be talking to you, Mr. Murray. All right. Thanks for dropping in. I say old man Webb was murdered and I don't care what the coroner's jury decided. And I also say Brad Clifton didn't leave Glorietta Springs just to hang himself in a dingy hotel room in Los Angeles. When were these taken? As soon as we got there. Nothing's been changed. I'm pretty broad-minded about crime, but a matchbox and a pill doesn't seem like much to go on. Well, it got me this far. Which ain't nothing to shout about. It don't add up to murder. Anyway, what if it does? You still don't have a case, you still don't have a suspect and you still don't have a motive. That's what I keep reminding me, that's all I need. Well, like it or not, you've got to face facts. Just 'cause Clifton happened to be in Glorietta for a spell, that don't prove nothing. Merely a happy coincidence, huh? Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. Sometimes yeah. But when both Webb and Clifton were found dead a couple of blinks apart, then it's time to toss coincidence out of the window. Smells of fish. Well, maybe it does seem a little curious, but I don't get any connection. They didn't even know each other. Murder doesn't need an introduction. Maybe not, but it does need an excuse. Not always. That's what's so tough. I remember a psychopathic killer we had running around— Wait a minute. What's the matter? Look at this. What about it? Find an error in this picture, and win yourself a harem. Huh? I'm strictly a city boy at heart, but I'll wager my pinstripe suit there's something phony about this tintype. Such as? Look at the tractor. - See the blades? - Yeah, what about them? They're in the ground, right? Well, that's where they're supposed to be. Only the soil around the tractor hasn't been touched. There's not an upturn clod in sight. So? So, obviously, the tractor wasn't moving when Webb fell off. My gosh! You're right. And now answer me this: Did you ever hear of a guy getting killed by taking a six-foot spill from an idle tractor? Don't forget Webb was drunk. Drunk or not, that's not much of a fall. And you're overlooking something else. It wasn't the fall that killed him. It was smashing his head on that boulder. - So you really believe that, huh? - Certainly. Say, what the— I'll knock your head off! I'm sorry, sheriff. I just had to prove a point. Just now when you found yourself falling, what was the first thing you did? Don't ask stupid questions. I hit the floor, that's what. I think that they threw out your hands to break your fall, that's what you did. Hey, what are you getting at? I'm just wondering how drunk a man has to be before he loses control of his instinctive movements. Say, are you trying to turn Webb's accident into something else? Is that what I said? No, but you've got a mighty generous imagination. Don't let it run away with you. I fell on the floor. Webb toppled over the tractor. And banged his head on the rock, yeah. I know. You know, there's something about that tractor that's beginning to intrigue me. Thanks. Hi, Andy. Evening, Mr. Landers. How's the manhunt going? Could be better. Say, Andy, as an ex Signal Corps man, what do you make of this? It's a piece of cable of some kind, isn't it? Telephone cable? Could be. Why? Nothing in particular. I'm just thirsty for knowledge. - Manhunt stuff, hey? - Yeah, manhunt stuff. I figure they may be hiding a telephone booth. Oh, by the way, where's the local telephone company? There's a branch in town, on Main Street. Oh, fine, thanks. Good night. Insurance investigator. Who do you think you're kidding? I haven't seen any of this stuff in years. It's what we call a lightweight subterranean cable. Subterranean? That's underground. That's right. They used a lot of it during the war, mainly for temporary installations on security reasons. You know what the enemy can't see, can't destroy. What about now? Do your people use it at all? No, I'm afraid it isn't durable enough for our purposes. I see. Who else around here might be using it? Well, I'm pretty new in this office, but, as far as I can remember, we haven't authorized any private lines. - I can check in a minute. - Oh, fine. According to our map, there isn't a cable line within 20 miles. It's funny. One more question. How'd you go about locating a buried line? That is assuming you have a general idea where it might be. Well, if the line's hot, it's a cinch. We use a milliammeter with an induction coil. It's very similar to a mine detector. Could I borrow one for a couple of days? I'm sorry. We have some, but we're not allowed to loan them out under any circumstances. What about these circumstances? I'd say they're very extenuating circumstances. Come with me. Hello. Oh, hello, Pete, what's the dope? Well, just came out. Looks like Andy had the right scoop. Well, don't jump to any conclusions. See how far it goes before you do anything hasty. - Know what I mean? - Yeah, right. Oh, look. In the meantime, you better pack the bags. We might have to join the birds and head south for the winter. Baby, I love you. Now tell me where it goes. Right smack to the hotel or I'm crazy. Looks like we're in for a little storm. I guess a little rain won't hurt you any. Is it that bad? Mickey, what happened? I — Believe it or not, I think I'm gonna pass out. Mickey! How do you feel, Mickey? Great. I'm ready to do it all over again. You had a pretty close call, Mr. Landers. An inch one way or the other might have saved me a visit. Thanks, doc. Come now and lie down. Now get plenty of rest. Oh, by the way, I suppose you know this will have to be reported to the police. You've reported it. Uh-huh, in that case I'll just forget it. That's a good idea. I don't think you'll need anything else tonight. Drop in at my office in a couple of days and we'll remove those stitches. Okay, thanks. Good night, doc, - Good night, doctor Bailey. - Good night. So you're a detective. Don't tell anyone, it's a family secret. What's all this business about Clifton? Was it just an act? What are you really after? It's a long story. - Well, tell me. - No, no. - What time is it? - Mmm, about 10:20. Well, that... that's more rest than I've had in years. Did you send for the doctor? Remind me to do something nice for you. You said that before. - Did I? - Yes, and I'm still waiting. Don't give up the ship, honey. I never break a promise. I'm not the trusting kind. How about a down payment? See me around the first of the month. I'm usually loaded. Where do you think you're going? Outside. Do you wanna come along? You're in no condition to get out. Listen, you're too young to be my mother. And we're both too old to play house. This hero stuff doesn't impress me in the least. I'm a dyed-in-the-wool realist. Good for you. I'm a detective. Detectives aren't heroes. We are too smart. We're plotters, bloodhounds, we ask questions, check records, waste shoe leather, get a lead... and I think I've got a lead and I don't want the scent to blow away. But you're still weak, you heard the doctor. I haven't time to argue. Just in case, as far as the rest of the world is concerned, I'm still an insurance investigator. Sure, but how do you know anyone else will be concerned? Something in my head keeps telling me. Come on. What are you looking for? Easter eggs, what else? Isn't it a little late for that? Well, don't be defeatist. The bunny is a personal friend of mine. Keep your fingers crossed. - I found it, honey. - Huh? Only it's attached into a hanger cable. You know, I have a feeling that room has the answer to a lot of my questions. I haven't the slightest idea of what you're talking about. Whom does it belong to? The room? 27C. That would be Mr. Foster and Mr. Kimmel. Yeah. Can we get the key? Well, I can try if it's really important. Darling, believe me, it's really important. Gone goslings! They sure didn't believe in wasting any time. Say, that's funny. I didn't see them check out. I'm afraid the depart was a bit on the hasty side. The end of the line. Mickey, I don't understand this. I'm all confused. What's happened? What's been going on? Monkeyshines, honey. Real live monkeyshines. That doesn't explain much. Well, I can't explain something I'm not sure of myself. There's nothing more we can do here. I'm hungry, let's go get something to eat, shall we? - The dining room is closed. - We'll got a bite at the bar. What's the matter? Nothing. I have to make a call. You go ahead, I'll join you in a minute. By the way, Foster and Kimmel, what are their first names? - Nick Foster and Peter Kimmel. - Thanks. Western Union, please. Western Union? Straight wire to Los Angeles. To Lieutenant detective Boylan. Police Department, Homicide Division. Please check records and wire collect Glorietta Hotel any available information on Nick Foster and Peter Kimmel. Vacation proving. You can cut off the nose to spite the face and still smell a rat. Love and kisses. Signed Mickey. Where's Andy tonight? Monday night is his night off. - Did you make a call? - Mm-hmm. - Did you order? - No, I was waiting for you. Can we get some food? Yeah, I'll be right there. This is a guy who doesn't believe in rushing things. Tell me, how well did you know Foster and Kimmel? So-so, well enough to say hello. What kind of business were they in? Oh, I haven't the vaguest idea. Yes, sir. - I'd like a drink. - Oh, no. No? Maybe I shouldn't, huh? - Not in your condition. - Perhaps you're right. - How about some soup? - No, I don't like soup. It's good for you. All right, I'll have some. There isn't any soup. Good, what about you? I've had dinner. I'll just have a cup of coffee, please. I'll make easy. I'll have roast beef on rye and a bottle of beer. No! I suppose you would have me have a bottle of milk. No. A cup of coffee. Yes, sir. You still haven't told me what happened to you today. It's after hours. Do we have to talk shop? No, we could just sit here and make faces at each other. You have a nice face to make faces with. - Have I, Mickey? - Yeah. It goes especially well with candlelight. I like to hear you say things like that. Tell me more. You'll have to say something nice to me first. Well, I imagine you're an awfully good detective. Can't you do better than that? After all, I hardly know you. Well, maybe we should get acquainted. - I'm Mickey. - I'm Jo. - Hi, Jo. - Hi, Mickey. Now what happens? What a question to ask an old friend. It's better every time. I'd say everything improves with age. Oh, how I'd love to be around when you're 70 or 80. This way I'd be lucky if I hit 50. You've got to admit it'd be fun trying. Cozy place, huh? How about some soft music? How about you doing a disappearing act, huh? Okay, okay. You got everything you want? I've mustered the hot kind. Coming up! With him around I can't understand why business is so good tonight. Is something wrong? No. I've just thought of something nice to say to you. Mm-hmm? You have beautiful eyes. Say, Jo. Is Andy off every Monday night? How do you like that? I give you a compliment, you ask questions. Yes, Andy is off every Monday night. Why? Excuse me a minute. Sorry, Mr. Guests aren't allowed behind the bar. Well, er... hold this in front of your eyes. You'll never know I was here. Where does Andy keep his personal things? I lost a ring last night. I think he might have tucked it away somewhere. In the drawer. No, the other one. Yeah, that's the one. TABLETAS DE SACARINA FARMACIA ACME For what is it useful? He's a diabetic. Takes insulin shots. But I thought he was in the service. The Army wouldn't take a diabetic. He ain't got in the Army. They gave him a medical discharge. Oh, I see. No, it isn't there. Thanks. What were you doing behind the bar? I wanted to see if they water their liquor. What about some dessert? Oh, no, thanks. I have to think of my figure. What did your figure ever do for you? Well, I like that. All right, I take it all back. Hey, Kilroy bring me a hunk of apple pie 'a la mode'. Who is it? - Telegram. - Come in. - See you later, son. - Yes. Anything serious? Hiya, Mr. Landers. Beats me, I can't figure out what's wrong. These things are Greek to me. Didn't they teach you anything about motors in the Signal Corps? Listen, the only thing they taught me was how to climb a pole, how to polish my shoes and march. I know from nothing about motors. Get in and start her up. Sure. Hey, you're all right. It was a loose connection, nothing to it. What happened to your noggin? You should know. Me? How come? Your buddies thought it was open season on detectives. Didn't they tell you? What are you talking about? We've been killing each other a long time, Andy. This has turned into a shooting war and your side missed. Brother, this heat's getting you. Better head for the shade. Take it easy, mister. I get paid for being polite when I'm on duty. I'm not on duty now. I am, 24 hours a day. - But I thought you— - A cop. Okay, you boys had your chance and fluffed it. Mister, believe me, you don't make sense. That's very funny. I thought I was a walking book of knowledge. For example, I know about Foster and Kimmel working a bookie racket down here ever since they were booted out of L. A. What's that got to do with me? They're big operators. 100 grand a year stuff. And big operators need a fast wire service. So? So if you can't buy the service, you get a patsy to tap a cable into a direct press line. That's where you fit in. You're their patsy. Oh, on the side you knocked off Brad Clifton at bottom. Oh, no. You got me wrong. I'm the guy that killed Cock Robin, not Brad Clifton. I'm tired of playing games, Andy. Let's put it this way. Clifton was murdered late last Monday night. Now can you prove where you were at that time? - Sure, I was with— - Foster and Kimmel? As an alibi, that's a weak sister, you know it. Turn the calluses off your brain, Andy. They wouldn't help you, even if they could. Look, you've chewed my ear long enough. If you think you've got something, why don't you run me in? The more you talk now, the better break you'll get later. Where have Foster and Kimmel skipped to? Why was Webb knocked off? I thought you had all the answers. Enough to make you squirm. I'm giving you a chance to turn State's evidence. Look, I told you once if you think you have got something, prove it, run me in. Do you think you can hold up under a lie detector? They're foolproof, Andy. - Try me. - Okay, let's go. I'm not kidding. You asked for a pension, you've got it. If this is a gag, it smells. It's no gag. All right, I'll play games with you. Get in and drive. Where to? Jackson County Police Headquarters. What's the matter? You're worried? - Do I look worried? - Yeah. You know? This isn't such a bad arrangement at that. - No? - No! I figure that after get through suing you, guys, for false arrest, I'll be able to retire. Don't be living in hopes, I'm just bringing you in for questioning. That's not much to go on. Too bad you woke up. It would've been easier the other way. If a man gets ideas about killing a cop, he must be pretty desperate. Don't attach so much importance to that job of yours. A few days under this hot sun and nobody's gonna know you were a cop. Just a lot of bleached bones. Before you do anything, you might take a look inside that car. The ignition lock. What about it? There's no key. What are you trying to pull? Go and take a look. Where is it? It's only 30 miles to town. 30 miles of wasteland and no traffic. How long will that take on foot? 14 hours? Get up. Take off that coat. Maybe it'll take longer. 16 hours. That's not too long. Unless you need your insulin to stay alive. Where's that key, Landers? Kill me and you'll never find it. Oh, maybe you'll find it if you look long enough, but you haven't much time, Andy. Under this sun, I give you 6 or 7 hours, and we can play a duet. How does a duet sound on harps? - Tell you— - I want that key! Scared? You're not even warm. You're starting to sweat, Andy. You can't afford that. You'll be dead long before you find that key. Where is it? I forgot. Give it up, sucker. By tomorrow, I'll go out like a light. I'm taking a load. I can't stand much more. Where is... where is it? Tell me where that key is! If I go out, I'll be out for a long time. A lot of space to cover in there, Andy, and such a little key. Not even sure I know where it is anymore. At least I got a starting point. That's more than you've got. How does it feel when you don't get your insulin? I heard you get dizzy first, and you start blacking out. Then what? Is it hard to breathe? Do you go right into a coma? How about it, Andy? Is that the way it happens? Tell me. I'm interested. What do you wanna know? Foster and Kimmel. Why do they skip, and where to? Arizona. You were supposed to be six feet under. The idea was to let things cool off for a while. And you're the boy to let them know when the temperature is right, huh? What happens if things just don't cool off? Then they head for New York and tie in with the eastern end of the Syndicate. The Syndicate? I thought they were working on their own. Like you said, it was a big operation. How does Webb fit in this setup? The farmer? He didn't. Why did you knock him off? - Pete took care of the farmer, not me. - Why? I ran the cable through some property he bought. One day, accidentally, he dug it up with the tractor. Nick and Pete went out to trace the break and when they saw what happened, they tried to make a deal with Webb. He wouldn't sell. He told them to get the cable off the property. He even threatened to notify the telephone company. - So they got scared– - Scared nothing. They were just worried about the dough they'd be losing. The farmer got rough, they got rougher. They slammed his head on a rock and killed him. I get it. - That's when Clifton walked in. - Yeah. Why did you wait till he got back to L. A. before knocking him off? Couldn't take any chances after he testified at the inquest. Somebody would've smelled a rat. Somebody did, anyway. Me. Anything else? Yeah, lots. We can clear it up at headquarters. Get back to the car. Let's see how good my memory is. You should learn about motors. Comes in handy. Like when you lose your ignition key. All you have to do is cross a couple of wires to get your car started. Remind me to tell you about it on the way back. Open it up and get in. Get up! Get on your feet! Go on! - Thanks, sheriff, ever so much. - Okay. Why so solemn? Things aren't as bad as that. You're not very smart. Not for a detective. Sure I am. Thanks. Come on, star eyes, this isn't the end of the world. We'll be seeing each other again. Will we really? Oh, sure. L. A. isn't the moon. I've heard they even have buses running there. You're just being nice too. Remember what I told you about detectives being ordinary humans? Well, it's the truth. Gee! I like humans. - How about it, lieutenant? - Okay I'm coming. Bye, star eyes. I'll be seeing you. Bye, Mickey. Mickey! If I come up to Los Angeles, how do I find you? Just pick up a telephone, dial operator and ask for a cop. They all know me.
