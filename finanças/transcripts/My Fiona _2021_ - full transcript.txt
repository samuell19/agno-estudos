Fi? Fi! Help her! Help her! Okay. Oh. Oh my gosh! Oh wow. It's so beautiful. It really is. I love you. I love you. Oh man, I have to pee so bad. Are you serious? Yes. Hold it, hold it! No... I can't! You are ruining this moment for me. I think that's ours. I think that one's ours. There's so many. This is so much fun. - Oh! - Hey! - Sorry. - We couldn't find you. I'm sorry. No, that's okay. What did you wish for? - Wait, what? - Sorry, what did you wish for? To meet you. I wished for us. I wished for... I'm Fiona. I'm Gemma. Nice to meet you. Do you wanna dance? My wife's love for life was infectious. Her curiosity was enlightening, and her care for her family and her friends was admirable. - You know there's no body. - Yeah. While our questions may never be answered... - Wait what? - One day they will... Gemma refused to bury her. This is the compromise, an empty coffin. Thank you for being my rock. She claims Fiona wanted to be cremated, and do you know what an empty coffin costs? - And my wife. - Is it less? - I don't know. - And my everything. What's the right answer here? Please join me in the Jewish tradition of placing the earth on the grave. How much longer? Come on, let me see your brave face. Let's go too, Bubbe. Here's Jane, Fiona's best friend. Hey. I'm so, so sorry, so sorry, Jane. Thank you. How are you holding up? Thank you. Jane? I feel really bad. These containers aren't microwavable. Where are the containers that are microwaveable? Bailey's halfway to starving. - Glass containers. - They've got green lids. I bought them for Fiona two Hanukkahs ago. I don't know where they are, but they're here, we have 'em. Did we prepare enough food? I don't think we prepared enough food. Oh. He's going through a hot dog and broccoli phase, likes a lot of melted cheese on his broccoli. Go be with your friends. Where's the microwave? There's no microwave in this kitchen. Where's the microwave? - Hello? - J-dog? B-boy? Did you wrap a fruit snack around your waist? Mm-hmm. I made a mess. What's the backstory? I wanted to see how many times I could fit it around me. - And? - Well, five-ish. Whoa, that's impressive. All right, what are we working with? Oh buddy, this snack is, like, stuck. Forever? Nothing's forever. Let's get this off you. Yeah, it's just tragic. I know, I mean, was it depression? Is that confirmed? I'm just guessing. Okay, our ride will be here in five. She didn't seem depressed at Lily's fairy party. I mean, she bought the glitter confetti. Well, I'm not saying that she was. - I'm just saying that that's one reason. - Mm. What did she have to be depressed about? You know, she gets to mess around with her friend at her little startup, and Gemma provides financial security. Oh yeah, her little startup. Oh, screw you, Greg. I only wish I had a job to escape to, stuck at home with two kids, one on the way, and a husband that's having an affair. Oh my God, really? Oh no, I'm just being a little dramatic, but my point is that life is hard, Fiona's wasn't. - Who are you? - Hi, I'm Greg. This is Kayla. Our kids go to school with Bailey. You're Fiona's business partner, right? Cool, cool, cool, awesome. So you guys are trying to figure out if she had enough reason to kill herself. Oh no, no, no, no, we are friends... How would you feel if your husband fucking killed himself, and I was ripping apart the superficial aspects of his life? Oh my gosh, no, I'm so sorry. One, none of my business how he offed himself, and two, there is no two; that's rude, - you're rude people. - Is everything okay? No, everything's not okay. You have garbage friends. - Yeah, I... - Excuse me? They're trying to put on their Nancy Drew hats, see if they can solve the mystery of Fi's suicide. Look, I would never call myself Nancy Drew. You know what? Go fuck yourself, Kayla! - We are seriously sorry. - It's fine. No, everything's not fine! - It's fine, Jane. - No, look, I am so sorry. You know what? You have no idea what we're going through, no idea. - Are you Kayla? - Yeah, sure. - I'm sorry. - That was just... I'm sorry you guys. Unlock your fucking door. - That was our ride. - She didn't mean that. I need to change the address. - I'll be right back. - I'll be right back. I'll be. I'll be. Right back. I'll be right back. Oh, shit. Hi Jane, it's Gemma. Rent is past due for Paper And Bliss. We haven't discussed how you want to proceed with the company, so call me back as soon as possible at the office, thanks. Viola! What's wrong? I don't know, I just didn't expect it to be so four walls and boring. Well, yeah, it's boring, asshole. We have to make it us. What, like plants and shit? Yeah, plants and shit. Artwork, maybe a splash wall. I don't know. I like it. I mean, I like the idea of it. You're nervous, huh? If I say yes, will that make you nervous? Of course I'm nervous. This is insane! I don't know anything about running a business. Um, you may have wanted to lead with that. Probably should have, right? Who gives a shit? If we fail, we fail together, hm? Whatever, right? I mean not whatever, whatever. - If you don't want to do this... - It's not that. It's just... this is your dream. - It's our dream. - Your money. - One moment. - Okay. - Oh! - Oh! - Can we celebrate now? - Is this real life? This is happening, mama. Okay. - Okay. - Do I need to shake this? - No, no, no, no, no. - Okay, do you want it? Absolutely not, it'll pop my eye out. You know what happened to my aunt, right? Yeah, she wears a patch, right? - Okay. - Okay, just aim it away. Okay, okay, here? - Okay, yeah. - Okay. Gemma, how we doing? Good, I'm just working on the terms of agreement for the Kilian West merger. Listen, the partners and I have been talking, and we think it might be best if you'd lay off the project. Why? Given the current circumstances, it's just best not to overload you right now. I brought this merger to the firm, Larry. I've got it under control. What's your issue? Is it my personal life? Because if you want to bring that into it, that's a different conversation, one that involves HR. Sorry to interrupt. Gemma, I have Jane Collins here to see you. Send her in. Let me know how you want to move forward, Larry. Hey, Gemma. I got some of Fi's stuff from the office. Um, yeah, have a seat. How are you holding up? Sorry, I hate that question too. Never been better. Hey, me too. Oh, I had one of the lawyers here draw up a dissolution contract. In layman's terms, it just says that all of the assets in the Paper And Bliss account will be transferred to you. Wait, what? No, no, no, no, no. No, you should take Fi's portion and split it. We don't need it, that's okay. Anyways, it'll help keep you afloat until you figure out what you want to do next. So how's being back at work treating you? Well, I didn't really have much of a choice. Just keep swimming. What? Oh it's just a line from Bailey's favorite movie. So is Ruth staying in town to help you with Bails? No, no, no. I have him in an afterschool program, and then I'm hiring a babysitter to take him to therapy and help out when I'm tied up in meetings. Where did you get that? Oh, I found it on Fi's desk, I didn't want to lose it, so. Here. She never took this off. I know. Thanks, Jane. Take care, yeah? Call me if you need anything. Have a nice day. Hey, I have an idea, hear me out. You shouldn't have some rando watching Bailey. They're not randos. They are professionally trained babysitters. No, that's not a real thing. Don't you want someone who knows him like you do like, like Fi did? I can't ask that of you. You didn't. I'm offering. Agent 455, I thought I'd find you here. Did you bring the package? Meet me round back; I'll give you all my secret money. How do I know you're not trying to trick me? Trust me. Is this your backpack? Let's roll. Let's roll? I heard it when I said it. Okay, that was too much. You're like the smartest kid in class? - I guess. - I bet you are. - Can I have some? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. Are you picking me up every day? For now, yeah, like or don't like? - Like. - Sweet. Oh, you have to meet my pet lizard. Oh, shit! He's from the imaginary pet shop. - His name's Dragon. - Oh, got it. Where'd he go? There he is. He just got a little startled. Oh, whoa, did you see those fire breathing skills? Whoa, smells like cinnamon. It does. Do you want to put him back? - Yeah, sure. - So nice to meet you, Dragon. - Okay. - Oh, give him a goldfish. - Yep. - I hear they love goldfish. Let's go. Your mom used to think she was a stunt... - You know what a stunt person is? - Yeah. She, like, fell down the stairs on purpose. - Oh, man. - Hi, checking in Bailey Flack. Hi, Bailey. He'll be out in a moment. Cool. - Let's go sit. - Tell me another one. Okay, uh, ooh... have I told you the one about your mommy and me, and Scientology? No, what's Scientology? - Do you know what bullying is? - Yes. It's bullying in the form of religion. Stay far away. - I'm Jewish. - That's great. So your mommy and I are on this road trip, right? And we're driving to LA, and we come across this giant castle, but they're giving away free breakfast, and like, who turns down free breakfast, right? That was the summer after your sophomore year, right? Alec. Oh my God, how are you? What are you doing? Wait, are you Bailey's... are you Bailey's doctor? Yeah, we've been seeing each other since the funeral. - You were at the funeral? - Oh, yeah. We spoke for a second. Oh, like yeah, I literally have no memory of that. I'm helping Gemma with Bails. She's not a real babysitter, so I'm gonna call her my Jane. Aw, I like that. You ready, Bailey? Yep. What does Gemma normally do when he goes in there? - Oh, she comes back in an hour. - An hour? Sometimes, she stays. Okay, I'll do that. Sounds like a better plan, because I, um, I don't have anywhere to be. - Jane. - Hey. Has it been an hour already? Almost. You have a second to chat? Yeah, sure. You cool to be out here for a sec, B-boy? Sure. Are you seeing anyone? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I got too busy to date, you know, after you and I broke up, Paper And Bliss starting, and then Fi getting pregnant, a lot of responsibility, so yeah, no. What? Let me rephrase. Are you seeing a therapist or a counselor? - Oh, my God. - Since Fi died. I feel like a God damn idiot. No, no, not at all. I mean, you're still aggressively self-deprecating. Aggressively determined to make a fool out of myself, that's for sure. It might not be a bad idea to see someone. Wait, are you suggesting that I see you? Is that what you're saying? Because wouldn't that be... - Unethical, yeah. - Right? No, I could never be objective enough, but I could make some calls. Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good. Thank you though. Yeah. How's he doing, by the way? Well, imagine being seven, your mom is gone, and you can't logically comprehend why. What do I do, or not do? I literally have no idea what I'm doing. Just be his Jane. If you listen, you'll know what he needs from you. Has he mentioned any changes in Fi's behavior before, you know? I guess what I'm saying is, like, did he notice or, like, allude to any... Jane, I'm a psychiatrist, not a mind reader. Besides, I can only speak to a parent about Bailey's sessions. Yeah, never were much of a rule breaker, were you? Okay, blink once for yes, raise an eyebrow for no. I don't know if you're having a stroke or trying to be funny; it's cute though. Hey, you can call me if you need anything, as a friend or whatever. Little advice though. Uh-oh. You need to work on your winking abilities. So you're gonna wanna make sure that you ask questions. The parents will like that because, you know, it'll make you seem interested and professional, and like you're on the ball, and you know the kid's needs. You're also gonna wanna have fun with the kid and do something funny, because they like that. You want to make sure that they know you mean business. I said you're not the boss of me! - Wow. - You're not the boss of me! Hey, hey, oh, off the couch. You get down right now. Bailey, I mean business. What are you doing? Oh! Get down. What are you doing? Whoa, hey! I told you, you're not the boss of me! Okay, okay, all right, no I see, here we go. I'm a mean kid, I'm a mean kid that's having a tantrum. I'm such a baby, baby, baby tantrum, baby. How'd that look? Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm so sorry I'm late. Oh, no worries. Do you want a glass of wine? Oh, um, okay. So how was he today? Oh, he was a little... he ripped up his homework. Oh, he's been doing that. I'm so sorry. Yeah, it was intense. - Alec diagnosed him with ADHD. - Oh. He suggested I put him on medication. Oh. He's just a kid, I mean, there's gotta be other ways to handle it. You ever read those advice articles? They always pop up on my social media. It's like I survived cancer without using chemo, that kind of stuff. What's happening with your hair? Oh, um... I... we played hairdresser and I was the customer. You were really lucky that he did not actually cut your hair. - Yeah. - He did that to Fi once. Oh I remember that. Yeah, I think it's gonna be a little difficult to brush out, but I don't know, it's just hair. I'll cut it; it'll grow out. Hold that thought, I'll be right back. What? I was kidding about cutting my hair. Not getting scissors. What happened to Fi's painting? Ah, that's a brush. It's good. What do I do with this? Oh, um, just don't throw it away. Yeah. So what... what happened to Fi's painting that was by the piano? Ruth. Ruth happened. She also asked me to bring over Fi's ashes for her to keep, when we come to visit for Passover. Ruth, I mean she's Fi's mom, so. She was just so against you even... It's fine, it's fine, it'll be fine. You're gonna keep some of them though, right? Yeah, um... I was thinking of turning them into a tattoo, and, like, putting a little bit of the ashes mixed in with the ink. - Say what now? - I know. My receptionist gave me the idea. She took some of her cat's ashes and made a paw print tattoo. Okay, that is somet... I never thought of you as, like, a tattoo person. Yeah, well, I never had a reason. How're we doing back there? Uh... We're doing. It's going really well, actually. You're so good to him, Jane. Hopefully Gemma's appreciative. ¿Cómo estás? Bien, gracias, ¿y tú? Bien, gracias, ¿y tú? - Yeah, I have no idea. - No clue, all right. Honestly, I think he's falling asleep during these meetings. Yeah. You're doing it wrong, give it to me. Hold on a second. What are you, like a snot connoisseur or something? Yeah, kind of. You have to go in circles like this. Is this, like, a thing now? Yeah, it's been a thing. I don't know why he's doing this to me. Thank you. Yeah, make sure he gets the email. Yeah, he's, like, warming up to me. It's been a good couple of months. I feel like I'm, like, getting the hang of it. Hey Ruth, I have another call coming through, I'm gonna call you back, okay? - Love you, dear. - Hello? Hi, is this Jane Collins? Oh, thank you. I'm not interested. Wait, wait, wait. This is Miss Sue at JT Elementary. Are you able to pick up Bailey? Gemma isn't answering her phone, and you're our emergency contact. Wait, what, is he okay? Yeah, yeah, no, I mean yeah. I would rather talk in person. Okay, I'll be right there. Come in! Hi, I'm Bailey's... I'm his Jane. - Thank you so much for coming. - Yeah. Bailey had an accident today. Is he okay? What kind of accident? - Incontinence. - Oh. Yeah, he refused to wear our in-case-of-emergency clothes. Poor baby, okay. I'll take him home. Here's the problem. He did it on purpose. Come again? At morning break, the kids were swapping food, and Arthur didn't want to swap his pudding for Bailey's carrots, so Bailey threatened to pee on it. - He didn't. - He did. Did he, like, unzip and, like, bring it out? No, no. No. He grabbed the pudding, sat on it, and peed. Jesus, okay. So we're looking at a three-day suspension. Okay, okay, is that necessary? We don't condone this sort of behavior at JT Elementary. Right, right, but his mom just died, so, like, I mean, can you even imagine what that's like for him? Things like this are bound to happen. Of course. However, we think some time off of school would be best. Right, for the school, maybe. So wait, your guys' way to deal with it is to not deal with it, that's awesome. Awesome system you got going on. You guys teach kids, you know that, right? There's no need to yell. So? So... Yeah, I got nothing. Let's get you home. Bailey, please buddy, come on! Let go! Oh, my God. Just get in the tub, buddy. It's just the bathtub. Bailey, come on. You are covered in pee. Here we go, my foot's in. My foot's in. Bailey, get up. Bailey, you got it, you got it, I got you, okay? I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Good, there you go. There you go, hey look, hey, you did it. You did it. I'm really proud of you. I'm really proud of you. You got it. You got it. Look at you. We did it, we did it. Oh, my gosh. Wait, Bailey. Bailey, did you hear that? It's the bubble monster, and it's coming to get you. I wanted to speak to you before the babysitter did. Understand our side of the situation. Yes, of course. I will talk to him, and I'll decide on the course of discipline, alongside the suspension. Thank you, Gemma. So why did you pee on the pudding? There's no right answer, I'm just curious, 'cause it wouldn't have been my go-to move. It is creative. I give you that. Mommy always used to put them in my lunchbox. Why don't you ask your mom to get you some? I did, but she forgets. Well, why didn't you ask me? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I'm your Jane. That's gotta count for something, right? I wish I could swap mom for mommy. Hey, Gem. Gem? Wha... I'm sorry... this is ridiculously inappropriate. - What the hell is going on? - What is wrong? Get out now. Seriously, get out of the tub, Jane. Okay. Okay, can you cover yourself up, Jane? Okay, I'm looking for a towel. He's got soap in his hair, Gemma. Gem, wait. Do not tell me how to take care of my kid. Come on. Go get changed, okay, Bailey. You call me when something like this happens. I tried, you were in meetings, I couldn't get ahold of you. You can't talk back to a teacher. You can't take a bathtub with a seven year old. You can't just come around here and do whatever we wanted to do... What can I do then, huh? Because he wouldn't bathe, he had piss all over himself... - Oh, my God. You're not a parent. - He was having a fit. You couldn't possibly understand; I don't know why... He just wanted pudding. He wants something new every week, Jane. He wanted a pony last week. Well, this isn't a pony. It's the pudding. It's the pudding that she put in his lunch box. I don't know, I don't know why... You're supposed to be helping me. I thought I was! Sorry. Call Alec. Hey, Jane. Hey, hi. You said I could call, so I'm calling. Hi, it's Jane. Hey, what's up? I need your advice. Are you doing anything tonight? Going to Milton's with a few friends. You still go to Milton's? You know what they said, if it ain't broke. - You want to join? - Yeah, I do. All right, let's... I'll see you there. Whiskey ginger, thanks. - Hey. - Oh, hey. Happy Friday. Fuck Friday. What are you drinking? - A whiskey ginger. - Awesome. There you go. What can I get you? - Mm. - Okay? I hate whiskey. Hi, Jane. Oh, shit. I haven't seen them since... The night you broke up with me. - Yeah, this is gonna be weird. - Yeah. Oh no, it's been a long time. She'll be fine. - Come on. - Okay. - Hey, guys. - Hey, girl. Do we know you? Yep, still hate me. I'm kidding, it's a joke. I'm so sorry about Fi. Thanks, Suz. So I'm gonna go... I... No, hey, come on. One drink. Thanks. So how naked were you? Because I don't think this has anything to do with Bailey. Wait, what do you mean? Well, she's a lesbian, right? Uh, so? So let's say Gemma was a man. Would you have been that unguarded? With a man, no. Yeah, but she's attracted to women, right? I mean perky nipples through a soaked T-shirt. - Ooh, say more. - No, no, no. On a scale of one to ten, ten being the absolute worst, it's about a six. Need a nanny for dummies book. Wow, cheap shot, man. Sorry, lesbian for dummies. Paul! Okay, okay, how about this? I used to undress in front of Fi all the time, never an issue. Well that's different. Lesbians don't have sex with their friends. They're far more intellectualized than that. Guys, take it from the lesbian. That's right. Okay, Alec. Help me out. You're the professional. No, I am off the clock. Come on. I understand why you did what you did. So why am I the bad guy? Because Gemma had no context. How close are you with Gemma? I mean, if Fi and I weren't friends, I don't think Gemma and I would be friends. I don't know; it's a gray area. Okay, see, therein lies the conflict. I mean, take Paul for example. He sleeps with girls he can't stand. Oh yeah, there's something in the aggressive dislike that turns him on. Sexual desire isn't built on love or the need to build a future. - Not always. - Sometimes never. Hold on, so you sleep with people that you hate? I do. I do do that. You're an honest bunch. I'm not mad at it. This was fun. Yeah, it was. Look at you, Alec. You're a doctor now. You're a mother fricking doctor. That's cool; you're cool. And some would say sexy even. When Fi became a mom, what did I become? Still figuring it out. Well, yeah, but there's nothing sexy about that. Hi Jane, it's Gemma. I've decided to hire a professional babysitter. Thank you for your help the last couple of months. I hope you have a good day. Bye. Hey, girl. Hey... Hannah. - How's life? - Never been better, you? Oh, my God, me too. It's crazy, right? Are you gonna be around this weekend? Can't imagine where else I'd be. Oh my God, yes. Do you think you could water my indoor plants? I'm going home for a week, slash Sundays for Passover, slash my sister's having a baby. I could leave a key for you. - Wait, it's Passover? - Today. Like today, today? Uh-huh. Pick a lane, any lane, pick it. Oh, you're not gonna use your blinker. Oh, that's great, that's smart, 'cause you know that's not for you, right? Hey. What are you doing here? You weren't returning my messages, so I made you this; it's a Ruth survival kit. It's got Advil for when she drones on, mini vodka bottles when she's being passive aggressive, coloring book for Bailey. It's stupid, I didn't... oh, just take it. Jane's coming? Oh, B-boy. Get in here, hi. Jane, you know how I always tell you my dreams, but you haven't been here, so I have all these dreams to tell you. - Do you want to hear one? - Absolutely. I have so many dreams to tell you too. Get in the car. You can tell Jane on the way. - Come on! - What? - Come on. - Go get your bag. - Come on! - I don't have a bag; how did... - Get your bag. - How did you know? Okay. You're good. You're coming with us. We're stealing with you. Okay, all right, you can steal me. - Come on Jane! - Hold on! - Hurry up! - Okay. J-dog? I'm coming. Get in your seat and buckle up. That was the second worst dinner I've ever had ever. - Bailey. - In my whole life, what? What do you expect? You two never introduced him to anything kosher. Hey, Bailey, show Bubbe your lizard. Gemma, you did not bring a lizard into this house. It's imaginary. Well, I would love to meet him. He's in my backpack and doesn't want to come out. Oh, that's nice, sweetheart, that's nice. The most important thing to me is that Bailey gets that money that is in a trust fund... - This is all pretty standard. - And that it's safe in there. I'm aware, so I completely understand. If you just tell me where to sign, I can. Cool! ♪ I'm Bailey ♪ ♪ I'm here on the daily ♪ ♪ I'm a dancer ♪ ♪ A thug, like prancer ♪ ♪ I'm J-dog ♪ ♪ I hiphop like a frog ♪ ♪ We spit a mean track ♪ ♪ Always have each other's back ♪ ♪ We're friends ♪ ♪ We put on a good show ♪ ♪ You wish you had our flow ♪ Drop the mic, B-boy. Woo! That was awesome. We are friends. Mm-hmm. You getting in? Thinking about it. - Here. - Ugh, thank you. How's it going in there? - Uh... - You okay? Ah. Can I ask you something? And I just want you to be totally honest with me. I'm not gonna get all Gemma on you or anything. Am I failing him? How so? I don't know how to love him through all of this. Like, I look at him and I just see her. You know, she made it look so easy and it's... it's not. It's really not. And, like, I know that I'm letting him down, you know? I don't know how to change it. Do everything you can to make it right. Even if you make it wrong, keep trying, right? How did she do what she did? Like what, her being her? Yeah, that. I don't know. She had this way of making you feel safe, like she was shielding you from the outside world. Who was shielding her? I thought I was. Yeah. Me too. Sorry. Thank you so much for helping out with Bailey. - He's finally down. - Yeah. Yeah, no problem. I'm really sorry you have to sleep down there. That can't be comfortable. Oh, it's not, but I have survived worse. You know what? Yes! Let's see. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. I wonder if it's still hits. Is that joint from high school? Shh! It still hits. It's nasty though. It's really nasty. Okay. Wow. Ruth is definitely gonna smell that. What's she gonna do, ground us? God damn, I miss her so much. Me too. I miss her every day. Me too. I don't wanna cry again. That's okay. Do you cry? No. Why? 'Cause I won't stop. That's why I can't start. Scoot over. I'm so mad at her, Jane. Like, I am so mad. Sometimes I feel that more than I feel anything else. Show me. - Dragon's dead. - What? - What? - He's dead; he's gone. No, no, no, I just saw him. He came in here and he was happy. You're lying. I got up and he was dead. Shh. What's going on? His lizard died, his imaginary lizard. - Oh, my goodness. - It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay, sweetie. Mom, you have to say those words. About Dragon? Dragon, thank you for being such a good pet. You were the bestest. And we hope you're happy wherever you are. - Bubbe? - Hm? Can we do that dirt thing now? Of course, honey. Alec, no, he didn't say how he died, just that he died. I don't... I don't... Jane, do you know when Bailey got the lizard? Oh, I met Dragon when I first picked him up from school. Okay, so it was, like, six months ago. I think he needs a better therapist. - No, Alec's good. - No, I did. - Trust me. - I started him on the low dose like two weeks ago. Wait, low dose? What low dose? Okay, all right. Thank you, Alec. What did he say to do? You put him on the meds? What did he say to do? Alec thinks that this is normal behavior, considering the circumstances, and he's going to bring it up in his next session. Okay, and the meds? - What meds? - Yes, Jane. I thought that it was a good idea to start him on the meds. What meds? Bailey has ADHD. - Mom? - Bailey doesn't have that. - He's rambunctious. - Well Alec thinks... That's not clinical. That's a typical seven year old. Alec thinks that it's going to level him out, Ruth. I cannot believe he would do that to a child. It was recommended. Numbing him? All that's gonna do is help you. Ruth, that's not fair, okay? Parents drug up their children to make their own lives easier. - Mom! - Fiona would never have done that. Wow, Ruth, you are being unreasonable. Oh, and what you're doing is any better? You're kidding yourself if you think you're all of a sudden gay; give me a break. Wait, what? Janie, I see everything you're doing to make this family stay together, but Bailey's life is upside down. This is gonna make it a whole lot worse. I would never do anything to hurt him... And if you ever smoke dope in my house again, you will not be welcome back. Yeah, you think that was the first time. Come on, Ruth. You're smarter than that. So are you. So, in light of Dragon's death... maybe you could come back and help us out a little bit. I mean, if you even want to, or if you even can. I don't know what you have going on. Yeah, no, yeah. I can pick him up tomorrow and take him to therapy. Thanks. Thanks, Jane. And Jane, I... Are we home yet? Yes, sweetheart. I'm gonna go. - You good? - Yeah. Okay, awesome. Yeah, you too. - Bye. - Bye. All right. Ask Vanessa. Can I please have a lollipop? You sure can, mister. Hey, can I talk to you real quick? Yeah, sure. My next client's in 30. Vanessa, is that all right? Uh-huh. Um... Holy shit. I'm only telling you because I need your professional opinion. Well as your friend, holy shit. Okay, but like, what do I do? As a therapist, tell me as a therapist, and I know, I know, I know that you're like, "It's unethical Jane, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah," but, like, seriously, I've no idea what I'm doing. Tell me what to do, and I'll literally... I'll do it. Here's a question for you. Did you enjoy it? Well, don't give me that look. Sorry, yeah, I just... I did not see this coming, okay? Um... Am I like a lesbian? Can it switch like that? I don't think you have to label it. Well, you labeled Bailey ADHD. That's an actual disorder with criteria for diagnosis. Then give me your professional diagnosis. There's nothing to diagnose. You're exploring bisexuality. No, that's gray area. Could this be like a symptom of something bigger? Sexuality isn't a symptom; it's a human experience. I need more, okay? Fi used to help me out with this kind of shit. I can't... I can't go it alone. I mean, you think I wanna be asking you for advice? At some point in my stupid life, I forgot to make friends, and forgot to, like, date. I hear you. Do you? Are you sure you aren't interested in talking to someone? It's obviously up to you, but I think it would be beneficial. There's a lot to unpack here. Then start unpacking. Sorry, Alec. Please... give me something. Maybe you slept with her because you really miss Fi; you both do. It was a very... Gemma's a part of Fi for you, and you're a part of Fi for Gemma, so you two had each other. So you're saying I'm not a lesbian? Come on, Jane. I can't define that for you. You might just have to be okay with that. Oh, that's asking me to do the impossible. Oh yeah, well, that is my specialty: taking the impossible, making it possible. You're welcome. You're a good friend, and, like, an okay therapist. Hey, Gem. You didn't have to do that. Oh no, I know. I wanted to. And there's also, like, a warm plate of food in the oven, if you want it. Thank you. How was your day, sweetheart? Kidding, sorry. Don't mean sweetheart. That's weird. It was a long day, darling. The partners are just waiting for me to make a mistake, just to prove I'm off my game, and it's really exhausting. I can imagine. It's sometimes how I feel when you get all Gem on me. Really? It's the last thing I want you to feel. I mean, I don't... I don't take it personally or anything. I was thinking I could maybe stay the night? Yeah. Was kind of hoping you'd say that. One, two, three! We made it for you. It's called Dragon's Looming. Oh, man. I forgot to bring a book. You wanna read to me? I'm not reading to you. Oh, why? Too romantic? Absolutely. He'll bite your hand off. Never touch shark. He lives under the monkey bars. He'll eat you and your parrot. Hey, I wanna jump, hey. Hey, you have to share! - Ow, stop. - Watch out. This is a park for sharing. - Ow! - B-boy, ease up. - Let me try. - No! - Bailey! - This hurts. B-boy, not cool, man, not cool. Bailey, hey, hey! Ow, get off! Bailey, hey! - We're playing. - That is enough. - We were playing. - We are leaving. Hold on, hold on. Can't he just take a timeout or something? Yeah, timeout. I am trying to teach him a lesson here. Yeah, but you're being a little harsh, don't you think? What? Gem. "Now Diego was met with a familiar feeling, "a flicker of passion." - Gem. - "If only she could..." I thought you wanted me to read to you. Am I done with timeout yet? No! Listen, there are boundaries. I'm literally just doing what Fi would have done. Exactly. That's why it's so weird, okay? What are we doing? Should we stop? If that's what you want, you have to say it to my face. Me neither. Do you ever think about her when we're together? Like think, think about her. I think about her all the time... but no, not like that when we're together, no. Sometimes when I feel happy... I feel terrible, like we're betraying her. Oh, well... I mean, if that's how you feel, then, I mean, maybe we should stop. No, no, no, no. I take it back. Go back to bed. Are you sure we have enough space in the garage for all this? I hope so. I don't really wanna get rid of all this stuff just yet. Yeah. Oh, I love this one. Oh, my gosh, Gemma, smell it. It smells like her. You want to smell, Bailey? This one stays. So is there anything in this box from Paper And Bliss that you want to keep? I don't know. Let me go through it. Okay, I'm gonna go grab some more boxes. Okay. Lollipop. What do you got there, buddy? Alec. Bailey, where did you find these? There. Hey, Gem, can I talk to you privately? Yeah, sure. What's up? Bailey, go play in the living room, okay? Yeah, but I wanna be here with you. Hey bud, ten minutes, and then you can come back. I promise, okay? Babe, you're freaking me out. Fi was on anti-depressants? What? Where'd you get these? Bailey found 'em over there. Was she depressed? I mean, I didn't even know she was taking these. You swear? Yeah, I swear. Were you guys, like, having problems or something? I'm sorry. What are you saying right now? Why would Alec prescribe these to her? Fi was a little bit stressed out. I mean, I wouldn't say that she was depressed. She was stressed out? She didn't seem stressed out to me. Yeah, well we were trying to have another baby. A second baby? Yeah. Since when? I mean she did the insemination two weeks before... She never told me that. I mean, you don't need to know everything. Why haven't you told me that? You don't need to know everything about our lives. You don't know everything about our relationship... Yeah, but you're supposed to tell me these things. I'm supposed to tell you every detail about my marriage? She said that you were gonna have the next baby. Wasn't that the plan? Well, we tried, and it didn't take. Did you force her to have the second child? I didn't force her to do anything. Are you sure? Because maybe she wasn't ready. We were ready... Yeah, but you're not the one that has to have the baby, right? Oh, my God! She had such a hard time after Bailey. She had PTSD or whatever that's called. - Post-partum? - Yeah. She had that, I'm pretty sure, right after Bailey. So what... what is it that you're saying? - You worked all the time. - Are you saying that, what? Maybe she was scared, I don't know. Are you saying that it's my fault that she killed herself? Oh, my God, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. I'm not... sorry, I'm just, like, I just need to, like, think through this. So you're saying that you guys wanted a second baby, and that stressed her out so much that she killed herself? No, no, no, that's not Fi. That's not my Fi. Your Fi. You know what I mean. That's not what I'm saying. You know what? She was a little bit hesitant. Okay. Because of you. Because of me? Okay, yeah, so you're just gonna spin it around on me now, uh-huh. If the insemination took, she was going to leave Paper And Bliss and stay home with the kids. No, maybe that's what you wanted, but she never would have done that. It wasn't an easy decision, Jane, but you depended on her. I would have been happy for her. That's why that doesn't make any sense to me. She didn't want to let you down. So you're saying that she was so worried about me, and that depressed her, so she killed herself because of me? I don't know. You know what? I think that's a story that you tell yourself; that doesn't make it true. I knew her. - Why do you do that? - Do what? You are constantly competing with me! You knew her better, you two were closer, you loved her more. Do you know how ridiculous you sound? I have never once made you feel - like I knew her better... - You constantly do. That's not even what I'm talking about right now. And it's hurtful, and it's childish, and it's pointless. She was my wife, Jane, my wife! I can't go here with you. Only when it's on your terms, right? Get the hell out of my house. Get out. Where are you going? I just have to go out for a little bit. How long is a little bit? Just, like, a little bit. I don't want you to go, Mommy. Hey. You know what? Your mom asked if you could go in and give her a really big Bailey hug. Can you do that? Go do that. I can conquer anything. I just need some help. Some of the most common side effects of Miderol are diarrhea and loss of appetite. Miderol may cause suicidal thoughts or actions, or unusual changes in mood and behavior. Suicidal thoughts or actions, or unusual changes in mood and behavior. Miderol may cause suicidal thoughts or actions, or unusual... Suicidal thoughts or actions, or unusual changes in mood and behavior. If you're allergic to Miderol, do not take Miderol. Ask your doctor if Miderol is right for you. - Hey, guys. - Hey. - Hey. - Jane! - Whose team am I on? - Mine, and we are losing. - That sounds about right. - You're up. You normally need a plan. what ball are you trying to pocket? - All of them. - It's not how you play. Okay, my turn. Well... Nailed it. Wow, okay. Wrong ball, but good try. Let's see. - Jane. - Why'd you give these to her? - Jane, not here. - Why did you give these to her, Alec? Jane, come on, please. Just come outside, okay? Hold on, Alec. Tell me. About a month before she... she started seeing me as a patient. She was having trouble sleeping, some anxiety. - Miderol is a common... - Why didn't you tell me? Doctor patient confidentiality. Alec, it's me. I followed up with her, and she thought they were helping. Okay, what was the exact conversation? I don't remember it word for word. - Well then tell me the gist. - That's basically it. What was her tone? Her tone, her tone was calm, casual. Okay, but what about the side effects? The most common set of side effects of Miderol include loss of appetite, diarrhea, but Miderol might also cause anger, suicidal thoughts... Yeah I know, but the percentage of suicide while taking antidepressants are slim. Slim, but it has happened. There's always two sides, Jane. Millions of people take them and it helps. There are people killing themselves... - Why do you think she did it? - That if they had access to medicine... - What do you think happened? - And therapy. I've prescribed them to many of my patients, - and it has been proven... - God Alec, please, please. As my friend, tell me your honest opinion. I won't get mad, okay? I just... I need to know. Could these pills have caused it? Uh... There's always a chance that the chemicals in the brain don't... If you knew that... if you knew that, then why did you let this happen? Why did you risk it? - I wanted to tell you, I... - What? Stop crying, stop it. - You don't get to cry. - I'm sorry, Jane, Jane, I wanted to tell you, I'm sorry, okay? Had I known that she was suicidal, - I would have treated... - Isn't that your job - to know though? - I'm a completely... - Stop crying! - I'm trying, please. - Jane, Jane. - Don't touch me, stop! I want to sue Alec. - Jane. - We can do that, right? We wouldn't be suing Alec. We'd be going up against the pharmaceutical company. They're ready for lawsuits like that. Our lawyers would likely spin it so that our relationship was the cause of Fi's suicide. But we weren't even together then. It doesn't matter. They'll do anything to keep their side of the street clean. But... I have to get up early. How are you feeling? Pretty terrible. I'm running late. You're acting like yesterday didn't happen. Oh, it happened. Talk about it later, okay? Oh yeah, I really like the lavender one. - I do too, and I like this one. - Oh that one's cute too, yeah. Oh, oh! Fi, Fi... - What? - Oh, damn. That came out of your body. Oh, my God. I think I'm getting a stomach bug. Leave me alone. To be honest, you should be the one leaving me alone, like Fi farts for my fall. Ah, jerk some Janerism generating Jamesom jiner. Jameson jiner with the Fi farts. Your passport's arrived. Yes, good timing. Where are you going? Mexico. Who, both of you? Yeah, and Bailey. Uh, no, I figured that he was old enough to stay at home and fend for himself. Five is way too young. Gotta wait 'til he's six, he'll be self-sufficient, then he can be our chauffer and our chef. Oh, I like that. Looking forward to next year. So when are you going again? - Monday. - Oh, shit. So we should reschedule the pitch. No, no, absolutely not. You got this. Gem could only get this week off, so you know, who knows when we can get away again. No, totally, but like, we should, like, reschedule it, because I'm not gonna do it right. You've worked really hard on this. I wouldn't leave you with it if I didn't think you could handle it. I can't handle it. Okay, I'm gonna go take a shower. Okay. - You're salty. - Mm-hmm. You know I suck at the talking stuff, Fi. Jane, you were great last time. No, I wasn't. I, like, fumbled my words. No, no, you were fine. You got this, you got this. Mommy! Shit, okay. I don't have time to worry about this. You will surprise yourself. You always do. Why didn't you tell her that we were gonna be gone? Because she gets in her head. Well, maybe we should just reschedule this for later in the year. No, no, she needs to learn to be okay on her own. Do you believe in heaven or hell? Why, what do you believe in? That's why I'm asking you, because I don't know where mommy went. Well, um... Come here. I believe that we have many, many, many, many lives, and we're given a test in each life, and hopefully, we pass it. Some of us do. Some of us don't. Some of us make mistakes, you know? Some of us keep making those mistakes, so we have to come back and take the test again. You think mommy didn't pass the test? Oh no, no, no, buddy. I'm sorry. That's not... that's not what I meant. I'm saying it wrong. So, mommy's learning new lessons? Maybe. Like a baby, or a squirrel, or a child, or a turtle, I don't know. A baby, maybe, but... So, like, there's a baby out there that's her? No one really knows, Bails, and we never will. It's the most... beautiful and tragic part of life. I feel like we should know though. Do you think you're going to pass the test? I have no idea, B-boy. No idea. You okay? Yeah. Hello? I'm out here. Gem, we can't do this anymore. We're always gonna choose her. I know. I don't know. I'm not sure how to do this without you. Me too. I mean, I don't know why I... I don't know why I can't say the words. Please, don't say them because... if you say them, I won't want to go. And I need to go. I do though. We need to think about Bailey. I love you. I love you too. Ma'am, one second, hold. I need permission. Hello? Landlord. Hey, Bobby. What are you doing? Uh, there's a woman here to see you. She says it's an emergency. - Is it Gemma? - You also haven't paid rent. I told you to wait outside. Are you smoking in the apartment? Not that I know of. Hi, Ruth. What are you doing here? You need to get your act together. I don't need to do anything. Okay. Come on, up. Up, you get. Take a shower. You stink. And then we're gonna get your puppy. What? I got one; his name is Cookie. He's very lovable. Well, I don't need a Cookie. Gemma's having a hard time too. Been staying with them for a couple of weeks. She's worried about you. Just tell her I'm fine. Oh, good God, stop feeling sorry for yourself. We all lost her. You're the only one acting like it was personal. I can't help how I feel, Ruth. You know, every day I wake up and I decide... I decide I'm gonna do my best. I put my feet on the floor. That's the first win. And then I feed Cookie. It's the second win. They're little wins, but they matter. Living in the past, it's the worst thing you can do. People that live in the past are clinging to their one dream. Life is for moving forward. Moving forward is hard, but oh, boy, we all have to do it. Up, up, you get. Dear Fi. Where do I start? Where we began, or when you left me? I loved you with everything I had to love, and I loved you that way because you loved me with everything you had too. That's what made us, us. I've gone over everything and I still can't make sense of it. You couldn't tell me why your soul was breaking, and I wish I had the chance to fix it. I'm forever broken now too, but I forgive you. I'm finally okay with being okay that I'm not okay. There's something liberating about that. Thank you for sharing your family, sharing your wife, your son. While I never saw it coming, it will forever be our story. You are my best friend. I never imagined that I would get this lucky. Thank you for making me, me. My wish is to see you again, but until then, thank you for choosing me to share your life. Love, Jane.
