- May we always be together forever. - Amen! - And stay friends forever! - Amen! Let's blow the candles! One, two, three! Siena? Hold on. Holy ghost! - Siena's ghost is outside! - Siena's ghost? - Yeah. - But she died. But I just saw her ghost outside. I don't know why she's there. Maybe she wants to chat with me? Talk slowly. - Can you close the door? - I don't see Siena. She's at the door. Close the door. I don't see anybody. There's nobody out there. No, nothing's outside. The ghost's knocking at the door! - Vina, bad news! - What are you talking about? Neni just saw Siena's ghost! No, I did not! - Tell her. - I didn't see any ghost. You did! I can see ghost, but she can't. - I didn't see anything. - You're freaking me out now. - Do you believe what Flo just said? - No. But I saw her! Oh, boy... But you said you don't believe me. You don't believe me either. What are you guys doing? I'm not a ghost. Take a look at my feet. - Go check them. - Yeah, go check them. Don't be afraid. Go on. Go help her. - Siena? - Ouch! - Siena. - Is she a real person? You're still alive. I was walking in the rain that day, and I was struck by lightning. Then I went into a coma... ...and later on, the doctor pronounced my time of death. Stop talking about dead people. What if she came back to life? Listen, USA already sent people to the moon, and you still believe zombies? Unless a cat jumps over the body. What did I say? Stop talking about dead people! Look what you've done! Her hand... Don't worry. Maybe you rolled the bed too fast and it rocked the body and the arm fell out. Put it back under the blanket. Then you came back to life? I was in suspended animation. Pardon me. You shake a dead girl's hand like you're gonna marry her daughter one day. You know what... I told you, don't talk about dead people! But you didn't listen! Look what you've done! I'm gonna run away! I'm running away! - Why are you still here?! - You took out my wig! But why did you come home in white dress with all your hair covering your face... ...and walked hunchback? You looked like a ghost! You scared the hell out of me! I looked down because I was looking for this. I lost my bracelet and I was looking for it and just my luck, it started raining. - It's your fault too. - Why me? You said you didn't see her. But she's still alive, see? I was scared too, you know. So I pretended I didn't see her. See, thank goodness not many friends at school knew that you were dead. But I'm glad she's still alive. Me too. We're so glad. Look, I found the bracelet! No matter what, we will always be together. Amen! I love you guys so much! Why does nobody hug me? - We love you!! - I didn't mean like this! "Nusa Indah High School" - Going somewhere? - Move! Met, Fir! That's Brama. Brama. Hi. Hey. Are you okay? I am. I wish I came back to life too if I knew it's gonna attract boys like him. You're gross. I am fine. But I have to go to my class. Okay, good. Come on. Why did she has to come back from death anyway? Host of the ceremony is entering the field. Present, arms! Order, arms! Oh, my God! Oh my God. Excuse me, excuse me. Somebody call the ambulance, now! Hurry up. So before Aini killed herself, you saw her crying in the toilet? I... I saw something else too. What do you mean? I saw a ghost. What are you doing, Nen? "What's the conection between suicide and ghost?" Internet junkie. Why did you come back from death? Do you think since Brama is no longer my boyfriend then he's a fair game now? Don't flatter yourself, and stop flirting with him. Hey. What's up? Hi. I'm fine. Let's go to the movies tonight. What? To the movies? With me? She's smiling. That's a good sign. Well? I can ask the matron for permission. - But I can't. - We're gonna celebrate your come back. Thank you. But I really can't. Well, well, well... - Were you listening to our conversation? - Did he just ask you to go to the movies? What did you say? Did you say no? I did. Siena, every girl in this school would kill to be asked out by Brama. Well, I don't know... - Did you die physically or mentally? - I don't understand. When Brama asked you out, why did you say no? I just don't want to deal with Denisa later. Leave Denisa to me. See? No problem. We have a bulldozer here to take care of it. Enough, guys. But that's a good point. Let's go back to class and stop talking about him. What's that? Shit. Open the door! There's a ghost after me! Ghost be damned! Open the door! Open the door! Who's calling me? Are you looking for someone? For goodness sake, Miss Badriah! What are you doing walking around in the dark wearing that? Gathering my laundry. - And your painted face? - I want a tight skin like Sofia Latjuba. What's wrong? Wanna experience death again? I saw a ghost! A ghost? Where? There's nothing outside. Where did you see it? Outside! I swear I saw it. Are you sure? There's nothing outside. I don't see anything. Okay, follow me outside. I need to make sure. Count me out. Vin? I have to do something in the morning, I need my sleep. - All right, I'll go with you. - Come on. Wait for me. Me too. Why are we looking for the ghost anyway? What are you gonna do if you found it, ask for a meet-and-greet? Shush. - Flo, are you scared? - Am not! - But your face is white as a sheet. - I'm holding my bladder! There's the ghost! - Go after it! - I'll go first! Move out of my way! Wait for us! You're running too fast! Where is it? It was here a moment ago. - I don't see anything. - Me neither. I'm not hallucinating. I swear, it was here a moment ago. Well, there's nothing here. Let's just go back to our room. I agree. Let's go. - Come on, Siena. - You're just hallucinating. Let's go. - Shit, Mr. Somad's coming. - That way, hurry! Wait! That's... That's the ghost. Where? I can't see it. - Are you sure you all can't see it? - No. - Now she doesn't need us anymore. - Let's follow her. - You first. - Okay. Wait for me. Wait for me too. It's so cold tonight. - Where's the ghost, Sien? - Ouch. There. Beside Mr. Somad. Here's your coffee. I don't see anything. Can you serve it with a smile at least? Look how sour your face is. Are you sure you can't see it? Because you're hardly ever home. Thank you. - Thank you. - He was fine yesterday. Can you believe it? Thank you. Siena, do you want to contribute? Mr. Somad just passed away. - I'm sorry for your loss. - Thank you. We're at the dorm collected a little money for you. Thank you. Stay strong, Ma'am. Although you have to raise your children alone without their father... ...be strong. I'm on my own now. Our son already left us one year ago. And now my husband died of a heart attack. Is there a link between Mr. Somad and Aini's death and the ghosts? Missing link? It's not the right time for jokes, Flo. I just find it's ridiculous trying to find the line between seeing ghosts... ...and the death of Aini and... What was his name again? - Mr. Somad. - That's irrational. Read this. According to the article, Siena didn't see random... ...rather dead relative of the dying person? - I think so. - It's just imagination. But the idea where the spirit of your dead family is coming for your soul sounds absurd. They're not Uber, by the way. One question, how come the only person who can see them is Siena? Why not me, or us? Why? Because Siena came back from death. I still don't believe it. I don't either. I believe it. Since I came back to life, I can see spirits. And after I saw two of them, two people died. I still don't believe it. I don't either. They saw a unique phenomenon on Mars in an area called Cydonia Mensae. Flo, I just saw a ghost. Impossible. This is a school. Never heard a ghost wants to be a scientist. Stop your nonesense. Now what? The ghost is standing behind Miss Fiona. Are you kidding me? Where? Flo. - What did they find in Mars? - Ghost! - Ghost? - Leave the class, Flo. It's your fault. Be careful, Miss. There's a ghost here. - Please come to my birthday party. - Okay. Thanks. - Come to my birthday party. - Thanks. Come to my birthday party. Bram, the race is tonight. Listen, we're racing against your archenemy. - Be there. - Okay, I'll be there. - You accept their challenge? - Absolutely. - Great, I still have more class to attend. - Good. Study hard. Bram. I'd be happy if you can come to my birthday party. - When? - Tonight. Please come. Brama. You're gonna be my date to the party, right? Sorry. Can we ever get back together? But I still love you. Let's just be friends. Bram, please. Bram! Why did you have to tell me there was a ghost in the class? I don't understand why any ghost wants to learn about planets? You made me feel like a joke. Stop laughing! I swear I saw one. And it freaks me out too. Because after everytime I saw one, somebody's gonna die. - Drama queen. - She's not a drama queen. - Stove. - Top. - Whatever. - You say. Gangs... Your supplemental multivitamin is walking towards us. - Hey. - Hi. Do you want to be my date to the party tonight? She can't. She's busy tonight. - Qur'an recitation, right? - I'll pick you up after. Sure. Stop it! Actually, I'm free tonight. - So, it's a date? - Yes! Sorry, but I can't go without my friends. Okay, so I'll see you tonight? Okay. Bye, hottie! I'm refreshed! - 100 percent recharged. - What are you doing? - It smells like a fresh grave. Smell it. - You right. This is definitely Vina's panties. It's bigger than a football field. It's so big. It can fit a village. Hurry. Let's go, our ride's here. Hurry up. - We're riding bike taxi? - Yes. - But... - Let's go. I don't wanna be late. But I dress to cute to ride a bike taxi. - Are you sure? - Stop whining. Fine, bulldozer! Hurry up. How about me? Relax, you're ride is coming. Here they come! What a waste of hours of grooming. You ruined it. I hate you! Wait, are you sure we're riding bike taxi to the party? But I spent hours to do my hair. The traffic is horrible tonight. Bike taxi is our best choice. Don't speed! - Wait! - What? Where's my ride? I see yours but not mine. Your ride is on it's way. Just wait here. See you at the party. This bike is so small it's like riding a tricycle. Next time, bring an adult bike. Wear this. I don't want your hair ruined. Need help? Let me help you. Shall we? Go ahead, I'm gonna park the bike. Okay, I'll see you inside. Siena? Yes? I have something for you. Open it tomorrow. - Thanks. - You're welcome. I'm gonna park the bike, and I'll catch you up inside, okay? Okay. Guys, so the bike taxi idea came from Brama? I know, he's so romantic. But have you ever wondered what did she ate to make him so crazy about her? He's better off with me. I'm good at dancing, see? - You're such a narcissistic. - I love the music. There's a ghost waiting for Brama. Where? I'm not kidding. The cakes look delicious. Especially this one. - It's blueberry cake! - I'm not kidding, guys! I saw a ghost riding with Brama. Then you're the ghost, Siena. Let's dance. Why can't you believe me? What is she doing here? I want to talk to you. Alone. Don't touch me. It's okay. Don't blame the balloon. - Let's dance. - Watch out behind you. What' are you looking at, huh? How many times should I tell you to stay away from Brama? Stop flirting with him. I'm not flirting with him. I saw you get off from his bike... ...and to you that's not flirting? I know he gave you something. Give it to me. No. Give it to me, right now! No, it doesn't belong to you. - Just hand me the stupid thing! - Let me go! Never take something that doesn't belong to you. Just forget it. Siena is not your girlfriend yet. You still have another time. You'd better tell her now. I'm just gonna say goodbye to her. Sien. I have to leave. My friends are waiting outside. There's a spirit coming for you. Thanks for coming. Brama! - Brama! - Siena! - Let go off me! - Let him leave! You don't know what you're doing, Denisa. - If I let him leave, he's gonna die! - What are you talking about? You've been behaving oddly ever since you came back from death! - Whatever. - Siena! Brama! Brama! Wait, Brama! Brama! Stop! Don't go. I have to race, it won't be long, I promise. I'll see you around. Ready? Three, two, one! Trust me, nothing's gonna happen to Brama. - You start getting on my nerves. - But there's a spirit coming for him! You don't know if the ghost is coming for him. I can't be wrong. Do you remember when I said I saw a ghost waiting for Aini and she died later that day? And I saw a ghost beside Mr. Somad... ...and he died too. And tonight I clearly saw a ghost coming for Brama. He's gonna die soon! Listen to me carefully. Nobody knows when someone's gonna die. But I do! I know when someone's gonna die, because I can see them! We win! Loser! There, he's still alive. Siena! Sien... Now do you believe me... ...if I say I know when a person is gonna die? So when you see a ghost, someone's gonna die? Then how about the ghost you saw in the class that day? Nobody died after you saw it. Maybe the ghost didn't find the family it was coming for yet. - I still don't believe it. - But it's true. Spirit of dead person could sometimes come for their dying family. Nonesense, I still don't buy it. Nope, nope, nope. - Hello, Mom? - Yes. I just want to make sure our dead family is only Riska, right? - Yes, she is. - And she died when she was 10? - That's right. - Sis? Hello, Flo? Hello? I don't want to die. No. What's wrong? I saw my dead sister. She's coming for me. But I don't want to die yet. Please help me. - You can see spirit too? - I just saw my dead sister. It can't be. You can't see spirits. I just saw my dead sister. Please come with me. I want to tell her that I don't want to die yet and I don't want her to collect my soul. I'm so scare. I thought you said you don't believe that a spirit could come to collect your soul. Will you help me? - Let me through first. - You're crushing me! - One by one, will you? - Who's going first? - The bulldozer just bulldozed us. - Stay close, okay? It's impossible if you can see spirits. Trust me, Sien. I saw my dead sister. She died 5 years ago when she was 10. I know she's coming for me. I don't want to die yet, Sien. Sis! - Sister! - What did I tell you? It can't be. You can't see dead people, Flo. Who knows? I might had a seizure once and came back to life and now I can see dead people too. - I don't wanna die, Sien. - Poor you. Sister! Hey! - Don't run! - Where have you been? Excuse my girls. My husband can't watch them tonight, so they're coming with me to work. Why are you giving me a blank look? You don't believe me? My girls are beautiful despite their ugly mom. Excuse me. Don't run around! I don't want you to slip on the floor. Yes, Mom! Who did this? You did this, didn't you? Are you testing our patience? Vin. You killed Brama. If you stop saying he's gonna die, he wouldn't be dead right now. He would still be with me! Why did you keep saying that? It's all my fault. And you just realized that? Now that he died and after all is said and done, you just realized that it's all your fault? - It's not your fault. - She's right. It's not your fault, Sien. Aini died because of me. Mr. Somad died because of me, and... Brama died because of me too. But... I don't even want to be like this. I don't even want to know when people gonna die. I don't want to be who I am right now. I don't want to be in this situation, but I can't. - I don't know what to do. - It's not your fault. What should I do? I didn't choose to be like this. Guys. Nen... A, B, C, first letter of a celebrity. R! - Ria Ricis. - Ryma Gembala. What's wrong? The ghost I saw that day, it's here right now. Do you know who's it coming for? Maybe one of us. Impossible. We're good girls, nobody's coming for us. - But it could be. - No way. You saw ghosts only at school, never in our dorm. So, maybe it's not coming for us. Copyright. The ghost is standing outside. She's staring at us. Wait, wait, wait. - Let me open the Ghosthunter first. - What's that? It's an app to help us find ghosts. - Are you kidding me? - Wrong poke!! Sien, where is it now? Over there. She's walking into the storage room. - Sien, can we not go after the ghost? - She's right. But we're not scared, of course. We have to know whose soul she's gonna collect this time. We're good. Right, guys? Don't leave me! Siena, let's go back to the class. Guys, it's beeping. That means the app found a ghost around here. It's beeping faster. That means we're getting closer. No point in getting closer if you can't date them. Stop joking! Siena, you can tell me about the problem you have. But don't spread hoax in this school. What do you mean? Denisa said the students are freaking out... ...because you said you know when people's gonna die. She also blames Brama's death on you. This school is still mourning him. It's better if you don't tell anybody what you see after you came back to life. Vina, wake up. Hurry. Nen, wake up! - The ghost is lying beside Flo. - What? There's a ghost beside Flo. We should tell Flo. - No. - Why not? If she finds out, it will freaks her out. What should we do now? There must be a way to stop Flo from dying. I know when a person's gonna die. But I don't know how to stop it from happening. Poor Flo. What are you all doing here? It's so hot tonight. - I'm waiting nature's call. - Ew, gross. - Hot, hot, hot. - I'm just here to watch them. You're not telling the truth. You're planning to do tricks on me, right? Eat. "The ghost is sitting next to Flo." "Huh? Are you sure?!" What's wrong? Want some more? No, I'm good. "Don't freak me out, Siena." "The ghost is standing beside Vina now." What's going on here? You startled me! I just farted. - I don't smell anything. - Maybe today my fart smells good? And what's wrong with you, Siena? How about you? I'm working out. See, I'm squatting. I don't believe you. You saw a ghost, didn't you? - No. - Not a single ghost. Right, Siena? No ghost. Be careful if I found out that you're keeping secret from me. Move. Let me through. I can't fit through the gap. Move a bit more. Excuse me, I need to fart. From now on, we have to protect Flo. But how? We start by protecting her from things that could kill her. Okay. We have to keep harmful stuff away from Flo. I don't want her to die because of this, and this. "Flo's Debts - Home Work" I was starving. What are you doing? What are you all doing? No!! Are your feet okay? Gangs, I found two infomations from the Internet. The first one is there's another person who came back to life... ...and can predict someone's death. Exactly like you. And the second one, there's a famous psychic who can cheat death. Why don't we try the psychic? But how do we go there without Flo knowing? I know what we should do. Flo, come with me to the library. - That's so out of your character. - I need to find a book. Did you come back from death too? - Move it. - Finally! Let's go. I'm gonna help you find a composition book about biology, math, physics, chemistry, and English. - Biology, physics, and chemistry? - Yes! - There's no such book, Flo. - Really? Well, who knows? I' m still gonna help you though. That's not a biology book. Stay here, I'm gonna look in the next aisle. You don't need a biology book, you need biodata. - Wait here. - You're too picky. Why are you still outside? Enter your class. I can't believe skipping class would involve a lot of workout. I'm doing this for you, Flo. Came back from death activated your sixth sense. You can only know when a person is gonna die... ...but you can't stop the death coming for that person. I cast a spell on this water. It helps to repel spirits coming for dying people. Make your friend drink this water. Thank you. What is this? Give it back to me. That's mine. Yours? Yes, that's mine. Give it to me. Take it. Please, that's not funny. - Give it to me. - Take it. I said it's mine! How would I know that? I saw it on the table, who knows it's yours? For once in your life, stop being bitches! - Ouch. - Did it hurt? You bitch! Why don't you get a life?! How dare you! I didn't know it was yours! You're always targeting me! What is everyone yelling about? Oh my God! You're in school premises, don't fight! Everybody, stop!! That's not a fair fight! Fight one on one if you're real women. I don't care! She's a bitch! Are you okay? Let her be! Don't touch me! Help! Somebody help! - Siena and Denisa are fighting! - You're joking, right? - Help her! - Okay, okay! Let's go. You just ran into me! Hurry up! - It was your fault! - I didn't know it was yours! Are you threatening her? I thought I told you to break the fight, not join the fight! - Help your friend clean her wound. - Come with me. I'll go get some ice. - We're not done yet! - Bring it on! Show's over. Go back to your rooms. There's nothing to see, this is not a theater. Are you all deaf? Leave us! What should I give her to stop the blood? Sit here. It must be sting like hell. The bottle. What about the bottle? The bottle's broken. It was Denisa, wasn't it? Vin, wait! Where are you going? She has crossed the line. I'm gonna teach her a lesson. No, Vin. Don't pick another fight. That water was our only chance to save Flo's life. There's no other way. What if the spirit takes her life away? - First Aid. Damn. - Hey! Tell your friend Siena to stop being a bitch if she still wants to stay in this dormitory! - She's my bestfriend. - Your bestfriend killed Brama! Hey, potty mouth, she didn't kill him. - She did! - Did not! Give it to me. You have to ask the matron's permission first. Move, move, move! Do you think I'm not afraid of you? Move! Flo! Wait! Stop, Flo! Give me the box. You have to ask the matron's permission first! Give it to me! - What was the cause of the patient death? - Fell down the stairs. Poor girl. Stay strong, Flo. She's right, Flo. You have to get better. It's been no fun without you, Flo. Death is our destiny. Nobody can cheat death. Stop crying. Vina, Neni... Siena. Thank you for being my bestfriends. I know you would do anything for me. You created a whatsapp group for me, right? It's called "Flo's Rescue". But you didn't invite me. I also know you went to a psychic... ...and he gave you a bottle of water. But Denisa broke the bottle. Siena. Don't be scared if you know when a person's gonna die. Promise me. That's a gift. Siena... I have to go see the other person who came back to life. I need to talk to that person. I know that person can help us. I'm not ready to lose Flo. I don't want to lose Flo. Me neither, Siena. Stay here. Watch Flo for me, okay? Be careful. I understand your pain. Since I blinded my own eyes, I no longer feel the pain. I no longer can see when a person is going to die. Is there a way to cheat death? Death is our destiny. Nobody can cheat death. Especially when it's time for us to go. But there's one thing that can ease your pain. What is it? Be there with your dying friend. Therefore, she can go in peace. Siena. Flo? Flo, you really are getting better, right? I promise, I will always protect you. Relax, I'm fine now, see? I'm pretty, dress beautifully. I'm fine, don't worry. By the way... Can you keep this for me? What for? Just in case I can't take good care of it. I might make it dirty. Unlike you, who keeps everything neat, clean and tidy. - Promise me. - Promise you what? Don't be sad. I'm okay now. Siena... Flo, even though you're gone... ...you're still with us in spirit. I promise. I will keep your bracelet safely... ...until one day we'll meet again. Flo, thank you for being our bestfriend. Now I understand, no matter how hard I try to cheat death... ...death will eventually come for us all. Because it is our destiny. Like you said, I don't have to be scared of knowing... ...when death is approaching someone. And I'm gonna try my best to embrace my gift. Keep her company, never leave her alone by herself. Because being with her is the best thing to do. Eversince I work here, they've never let me transporting living patient, always the dead ones. Are you jealous? If you are, you can lay down on the bed, and I'll push it for you. I'm not dead yet, you moron. Be grateful for having a job. You're paid to do this. Why are you stopping? Are you mad at me? - Asrul, do you remember that girl? - Who? That girl. And she is in our way. Isn't that the girl we transported to the morgue that night? What is she doing here? Don't ask me, ask her. Maybe she has an unfinished business with us. What should we do? Are you crying, coward? Where's the body? Asrul! Sleep now. Don't sit. You're not in a bus. Asrul! Shit, where is he?
