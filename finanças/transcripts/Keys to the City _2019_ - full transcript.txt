[Applause] I grew up in a place wheresimply surviving from day to day was the goal. But, my grandmother taught meand my brother, Jules, to always think outside the confines of Bowen Homes. Before our grandmother passed away she would plant seeds wisdom, and as they began togrow, our perspectives shifted. I knew, sitting on the Old Truss Bridge, staring at the Atlanta skyline, there was something bigger and better for me out there. All I had to do was be bold enough to go after it. And, I did. I owe my gratitude to August and Brenda King adopting and raising me and my brother, instilling purpose and showing us everything I now aspire to become. I'’m grateful to have you both here with me tonight. I love you both. My late wife Dina, who many of you already know She always believed in me We had this pact Always move in greatness And as I look around this room seeing all of your faces reminds me that I am honoring that pact. As my grandmother always said, 'You'’re only as strong as you allow yourself to be.'’ Never give up. Consistency willalways lead to success. So come this January, I look forward to serving you all As your new mayor. "“Creating a secure foundation for our future"” isn'’t about the people. It's therhetoric used to secure votes so Russell Savage cancontinue to run your government behind closed doors. Russell Savage, not your choice for Atlanta'’s Mayor. Paid for by the campaignto elect August King for Mayor. So I guess the gloves are off? What gloves? We'’re getting our asses kicked. The question is, how do wecombat this without compromising our integrity? Hey, Russell? Are we interrupting you? Look. August has been sling'’n mud in this game for 25 years. That'’s his thing. We don't needto do that. Let him and his exhaust themselves. A barrage of smear campaigns are coming our way. I know he'’s your friend and all- He'’s my father. Be careful. Sources have telling me thatthey plan to run ads like these, for the next few weeks. On several networks. So what are we gonna do? Y'’all get my notifications on IG, right? [phones vibrating] [laughing] Oh, wow. Five thousand likes already? No, 13,000. 22,000. Okay I see you Russ I'’m focused. But I can'’t have my team being distracted by our opponent'’s smear tactics.

Mr. Savage you'’ve gained a lot of popularity over the past few weeks Social media has pinned your fiancé as '‘Miss Atlanta'’. Do you feel that you owe her for that lead? Well I'’d like to think I'’ve gained a lot of voters because the people want change. And not because they'’re caught up in my personal life. But you have to admitIt'’s quite interesting to watch.

Mayor Thank you Don. It'’s extremely important for the next mayor to uphold the the foundation that our beautiful city has been built upon. And there's no doubt, whatsoeverin my mind that August King would be an outstanding Mayor. He's brilliant. He is seasoned. And he's one hell of a visionary. Being that he has mentored Mr. Savage and myself. brings this round table full circle.. There really no loss here, with either one of these two candidates. We all win because we come from the same stock. Which is why I have chosen to endorse Russell Savage as the next Mayor of Atlanta. I didn't see that one coming. the cutting-edge vision that Atlanta needs moving forward can only come from omeone who understands not only traditional but contemporary concepts. And that man is Russell Savage. Well, there you have it Russell Savage receives Mayor Briggs endorsement That'’s it for today. We'll seeyou next time on Atlanta Today. I'’m Don Felt. And we're clear.

The debate can make or break an election with or without his endorsement. Remember that. Hmm? Gloves back on? Never ever take em'’ off, son. C'mon. Let's go. I spoke to one of the investigators who was working on the case. Come to find out He didn'’t even believe it was an accident. But because the dude, Frank wouldn'’t corroborate, the detective didn'’t have enough evidence to continue the investigation. So the case was closed. So she'’s not just crazy, she'’s dangerous. she'’s got us by the balls bruh. We gotta keep her close, now. How much of this does August know about this? Have either of you mentioned any of this to him? I haven't. I wouldn'’t take that chance. He'’s still my opponent. Okay. Okay. So what do we do? The debate is in a couple days. It'’s too risky to have her there. And I'’m under enough goddamn pressure. We need this bitch in order to win this Aww bullshit. I can win this without her. No. You can't. We'’re in too deep.

What is it about your temperament, and overall skills, That's a fact. The same question goes to you, Councilman Savage. Everything that the media has been saying about me is true. Yes, I was raised and groomed by August King. Growing up in politics helped me understand its nature, but with a fresh pair of eyes and a unique perspective. This is what gives me the edge To be able to speak the language of my predecessors and yet relate to a newer generation. Things are changing. Whether we like it or not. We need someone in office who can understand that dynamic. My hat goes off to Mr. King for his 28 years of excellent service to our wonderful city. But moving forward, I doubt he'’ll have the foresight to lead Atlanta'’s diverse communities. I am a symbol of that diversity which makes me the best candidate to step into position of Mayor of Atlanta. Thank you. That concludes our evening. I'’d like to thank both candidates.

Everything'’s supposed to be perfect. standing in the perfect white dress- with the perfect man her loving father walking her down the isle. All the things Dina had on our wedding day, and the things you will never have. I'm sure I will. You'’re certifiable. I'’m a woman with a plan. I was precise and now i have the perfect man. You'’re delusional. I'’m not your man. I know about Frank. It wasn'’t an accident, was it? You put him in that wheelchair, didn'’t you? Which made me wonder what ever happened to your biological parents? You'’ve never mentioned them. Shut your á*áá*áá* mouth. You hurt them too, huh? Shut the á*áá*á up. You have no idea what you'’re talking about. You talk about this hard knock life backstory growing up, at least you had a grandmother who loved you, a brother to protect you and parents who took you in. My biological father was too busy paying off my mother to get rid of me. He tried to throw me away just like you'’re trying to do now Wise man. [music swells] [shrieks] [grunts] [doorbell ring] Ahh! [screams] [yell] Russell! Avery! [crying] August! August please help me. He'’s trying to kill me- Avery. What the á*áá*á is going on? Russell? [grunts] Please. Help me! Son, Oh my God are you okay? You son of a bitch. What about me? Avery. Your own flesh and blood? Avery, put the glass down. You'’re hurting yourself. Shut up. You don'’t care. Don'’t act like you care. Please, Avery. How could you do it? How could you just throw us away? Like we were nothing. I am so sorry, I didn'’t know- Oh, don't! I'’m sorry- Don't! I didn't know! You have no idea the amount of pain you've caused me. She killed herself and I was the one who found her. Because of you. [stairs creaking] Avery, please. I'’m sorry. I am so sorry that you had to go through all of that. But doing this is not going to change the past. I was young and foolish and I made so many mistakes. and I hurt a lot of people I... I know that. You left me. You left me. Avery. If I had known anything about you, None of this would never have happened. You need to start blaming your mother. She did this to you.
