Since its production in 1934, Jean Vigo's L'Atalante has undergone numerous transformations, mutilations, and attempts at restoration. The version of the film presented here aims to be as true as possible to the original version. Come on, get a move on! Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, amen. Don't be sad, my dear. She's found a good lad. Besides, she'll be back one day. To think she's never even left the village... Pity there's no reception. I like a good meal. Oh, you! - Are we going to the barge? - All that way for a stranger? What do you say to the bride? What you said. And what did I say? It seems the barge is behind schedule. The shipping company won't like that. Get in line there. Stay in couples. That's good. Couldn't she marry a local boy? She always has to be different. She's tired of village life. Hurry up. They've already reached the village. So you got it now? Yeah, yeah. That's no answer! What do you do? I go up to the missus and say... What do you say? I say, "Wishing you a happy life aboard L'Atalante." All right. You got the flowers? - I'll get the bucket. - Eat! Wrap 'em in paper or they'll get her dress wet. Here they come. I've got the rope. Idiot! Stupid idiot! Good going! Give me that! Now my cap's gone in too! I'll buy another bouquet. In the middle of nowhere? They're practically here! Everything's ruined. Where are you going? Never mind now! Forget it! Come back! I won't yell at you! Forget it! I'm gonna pick some! The good Lord's got it in for me. Get a move on! Hurry up! Hold on! Don't fall in! Wrap 'em in paper! Wishing you a happy life aboard L'Atalante. Wrap 'em in paper! - We leavin' now, skipper? - You know we are! Then I'll start 'er up. Hey, missus! Juliette! Your daughter's right there. Good-bye! Farewell! Let's do this properly and wake the missus with a song. There she is! One, two, three... We're on the barges to work, not to play Not to wander but to ply the canals all day Seated at the helm we're kings of the realm A pretty girl's smile May beguile us a while There may be hard times too But we'll see them through With a cheerful heart That's what bargemen do! When young folks set out on a barge And live that life day after day The sun begins to bronze their skin Their eyes turn paler than the wind The bargemen have stolen them away... Approaching shore! Ready the ropes! We're docking! You and your filthy cats! Come look what they did on our bed. You coming? They're not as filthy as you, and not as dumb either. A lot less dumb. There. Kitty had her babies! Where were you hiding? In our bed... that's where! I'm not the father, you know! Look at 'em. Out with 'em or I'll throw 'em overboard. Overboard? You'd drown your own son! Come on, Kitty. Let's go. Let's not stay here with these meanies. He's got three more just like that. - Where's the linen go? - In the closet. Do you do wash once a year? If that! Well, that's going to change. Wait till tomorrow. No. Why? Not today! Come on. You'll have plenty of time. - Wait. - All right, then. I'll help. I'll fix us something to eat. I'm here for your dirty wash. My dirty wash? Oh, Kitty had her babies! What for? The boss lady's doing the wash. She wants to wash my things? P?re Jules won't give me his wash. He won't? No, he won't. I washed my own feet before she got here! Don't be an idiot. Let's have it. Only to keep the missus happy. I'd do anything for her, even the shopping. There's the scrap dealer. Hey, Rasputin! Hey, Rasputin. I've got a record. A record? A long one? See for yourself. I haven't finished fixing up my phonograph. P?re Jules and his old pal. He always gets talked into buying stuff: springs and old parts and whatnot. We're on the barges to work, not to play Not to wander but to ply the canals all day What? You closed your eyes? Of course. I wasn't expecting that. What's it matter? What's it matter? Don't you know you can see your beloved's face in the water? - What? - It's true. When I was little, I saw things like that. And last year I saw your face in the water. That's why I recognized you when you first came to the house. Really? I didn't see anything. Wait. Jean, stop! That's enough now! You're crazy! - I don't see you! Stop it! It's not a game! I don't see you! Now I see you! I see you! Here, take your bag. You call that wrestling? I'll show you some real wrestling. Paul Pons versus Raoul the Butcher. En garde! A headlock brings him to the ground! Now it's an armlock, then into a bridge! I've got him. A snapmare... parried by a reverse bridge! Pinned by both shoulders! How about that? They ran off, the swine. You're a silly one. I just wanted to see you. Then look at me! There, in the water! You laugh, but it's true. You'll see one day, when you really try. Put this on. It's nice and warm. Jean? Are you coming down? Jean, it's 5:00 a.m. Aren't you going to stop? It's raining! Is that my fault? The missus is right. She needs more than a quilt! Go hit the sack, skipper. A bit to starboard, a bit to port... It's like this every night. Are you bored? Don't worry. There'll be places to see. Riverbanks. Jean, will we be there soon? Where? I don't know. Somewhere. Anywhere. A city. A big city. Does unloading take long in a city? Paris calling. Jean, it's Paris! - What? - Paris! You surprised? Is it far? Near or far, it sounds the same. I just want to know when we'll get there. Too soon. Those docks at La Villette are no picnic. Get dressed. Paris calling with the latest news. It's sales week, and the department stores are full... Talk and more talk! No, leave Paris on. Careful! You'll bust it! You be careful! There! Violet is the rage this season, in lam? and satin for evening wear. Hats are worn beret-style, coquettishly askant. P?re Jules! Drop anchor! Prepare to dock! Turn on the lights. Don't fall in. I'm gonna see the missus. Hey! You almost rammed us! Yeah, well... I couldn't see a thing. Well, be careful! Juliette. Where's the missus? Where's the missus? Why didn't you answer? You scared me! - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Leave us alone. - Leave you alone? - Get to work. I've had about enough of him and his Juliette. "Get to work"? Does she grease the engine? All day long, it's either smoochin' or squabblin'! Well, I'm clearing out. I've had enough. I'm fed up! My babies. You're a pretty one. Those swine! - Think he's mad? - No. Where'd he go? He's not about to run off. Don't worry. Your P?re Jules will show up. You could try being on time. Scat, Kitty. You're not welcome here. Come on, stop sulking. I'm not sulking. Looks like the fog's lifting. We have to make up for lost time. No, finish your grub. Come on, kid. - Me? - Yes, you. What are you doing? Sewing. Sewing? You're sewing? Never seen a sewing machine before? Me, never seen a sewing machine? Let me see that. Scoot over. You're a real jack-of-all-trades. You bet I am. Look at these hands. You'd never guess all the things they've done. One night in Shanghai they came up like this and... Come on, P?re Jules. Stop fooling around. Don't push me, missus. I'm not a bad sort, but if you push me, I push back. That's enough now. Since you know so much, put this skirt on. - Put this skirt on? - That's right. Be my mannequin so I can sew the hem. The hem? All right, sew the hem. Looks good on me! How do ya wear this thing? That's enough now. Keep still. I can't put it on. How does this go on? Can't you button it? Suck that belly in! What a dainty waist! Don't tickle me. Don't tickle me, missus. Stand up straight and put it on right. Put it on right? No fooling around, missus. Stop it or I'll stick you! You think you're back in Africa? You think you're back in Africa? Africa! I've been lots of other places too. Yokohama, Melbourne, Shanghai... Papeete, San Francisco. 1903... with Dorothy! Singapore! San Sebasti?n! Give me my skirt before you rip it. Go on now. Take your wash. Let me catch my breath. I didn't do no harm. I'm tired. Are you going or not? No, no, no... and no again! P?re Jules! We're in Paris! All hands on deck! The boss said to get a move on. The boss? Who's that? Who's the boss around here anyway? I'll show you my puppet. I got him in Caracas after the revolution in 1890. I never imagined your cabin was like this. It's a regular curio cabinet. Nothing but the finest things. Nothing but the finest things. That's from Havana. That caused some trouble with Dorothy. An anatomical specimen. From a hunting trip. - And the phonograph? - It doesn't work. Needs some more work. From Japan. Delicate work. All done by hand. All done by hand. That's some knife! That's no knife. It's a navaja. It's sharp. - You hurt yourself! - It's nothing. Wait. I'll get something to bandage it. These cats! Is this you? No, that's my... friend who died three years ago. What's that? His hands. All I have left of him. And what's that? My chain? No, that. My tattoos? Those are tattoos. I'll show you. They keep you warm. Nice and warm. I'll play the accordion for you. A tarantella. You have pretty hair. So do you, P?re Jules. You have pretty hair too. Not as pretty as yours. Here, I'll part it for you. You're very kind. That tickles! I'm not used to such attention. What the hell are you two doing? And look at this mess! Nets everywhere! I've told you a hundred times... none of this stuff onboard! And it stinks in here! Filthy cats! And why the hell are you in here? - What's that picture? - Me as a little kid. Pull my leg, will ya? You as a little kid! Was your hair like that then too? Look at that mug! I forbid you to come in here. And don't look at me like that. Are you crazy? This isn't your cabin. Not my cabin? Well, you think it's yours? There! You cut your hair? DOG BARBER That one had a screw loose! Come on. They forgot that one. Don't be angry. Seeing you with that old sheared goat drove me crazy. You've wanted to see Paris for so long, and I'm done early for once. Seven years of bad luck. They don't need you. Let's go out. Put on a collar? I'd like to go out on the town for once. You're right. Get ready. I'll show you the sights. Stop raising so much dust. Wet the floor down first. Look. My first time to wear it. What about you? You gonna get dressed? Hurry up! Careful! Don't pull 'em all out! - Ya seen my chain? - With your good-luck charm? It's broken! - Just fix it. - It's not that simple. It can't be fixed. I'm in for some bad luck. Hand me my duds. We gotta get goin'. What's this stuff? Moth balls. It's your wedding suit. - Well, it stinks. Skipper! He scared me! What's wrong? ls there a fire? I'm going for a consultation. - Are you sick? - No, but I'm going anyway. Let's go. Look. I'm ready. We have to wait for P?re Jules. He's not coming with us, is he? No, but he's gone into town. To see someone? Yeah, a doctor. He's sick. He took the kid with him. I can't leave the boat. Just say it: We're not going out. Sure we are, but later. We're just not going out, that's all. Don't get changed. Why not, if we're staying here? Don't hold your breath waiting for P?re Jules. What about my broken chain? Don't worry. Your cards are good. Yeah, my cards are good. Give me your hand. Your hand. - So the cards are in my favor? - Yeah, don't worry. Ah, you're the sensual type! You've broken a few hearts in your day. A few... a few. You like to eat too. But don't worry. There's some good too. Yeah, you'll be all right. I will? No problems at all. Happy now? Yeah. I can give you the full treatment now if you'd like. - Beat it. - What? She ain't tellin' your fortune! Wait outside! Okay, okay, I'm going. The full treatment? - If you'd like... - You bet I would. - You gonna wait long? - He'll be back soon. I don't want to go out anymore anyway. Go back now and get some sleep. Eh, what the hell? The cards are in my favor. P?re Jules! He'll be back later. He had stuff to do. I knew it. Paris, Paris Oh, infamous, marvelous city Ah, here you are. I dreamed you went off and left me. What a nightmare! You're so cold. Anybody home? Do I have to call the cops? Rise and shine! It's P?re Jules! Paris, Paris Oh, infamous city of love Dear to the hearts of rogues Paris, the great enchantress Hello, handsome. I'm putting you to bed. Dear to the hearts of lovers And rogues Just wait. I'll show you Paris! All right, skipper. Don't push! It's the missus in her nightie! Wake up, kid. P?re Jules has been at it again. Any town we come to, he has to make a splash. The sooner we leave, the better. We're up now, so we may as well get going. You two can help cast off. Come on, kid. Get your britches on. - You're not mad at me? - No. Why would I be? We finally get to Paris, and he acts up. That's nothing new. But we'll be back, and I promise we'll live it up. I'll take you to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Promises... You don't believe me? We'll have some fun before we get to Corbeil. We'll go dancing tomorrow at the "Quatre Nations." We're as good as there. FANCY GOODS INSIDE My dear friends, so kind of you to come. We were just waiting for you before we served the biscuits dry as the duchess's pussy. Oh, sorry. Did you bring a birdie? You like this scarf? Oh, pardon me. I have a much nicer one. You can take this anywhere. Indispensable, always in fashion, wrinkle-free, and rustproof! Watch carefully. Gone! - It's in your pocket. Just a bit of magic dust... and there it is again. Watch now. It's gone again. Look here. A little card trick? Oh, sorry, sir. A little card trick, sir? Pick a card, any card. It's all the same to me. Stick it in wherever you like. There, for example. It has to be the four of spades. And there you are. May I interest you in some suspenders? Some stockings for the lady? No? What a shame. Look out. Oh, beg your pardon. - What will you have? - Red wine and a beer. Here he goes. I left Paris with my wares You're so pretty! To wipe away your cares And you are too. Out here we're far from the city But you're especially pretty.

And a special gift with every purchase: a free dance for the lady. You really don't know Paris? No, I've never been. That's wonderful! Cough up some change. Come on, folks. The music will be right back. Thank you. No kidding? You've never seen a speck of the city? You're wonderful! I could teach you all sorts of things. If the lady is yours, so is the scarf... paid in full! I said it's paid in full! - At least here you'll behave. - You going out? - Yes. - You're not taking me? I've come to apologize and say good-bye with a tune. Here. You left your scarf behind. Thank you. A little something from Paris. A bit of the city. I'll be in Paris tonight. Want to come? I'll take you. Just like that, in a flash! You'll just get rheumatism on this old thing. I'll take you on my bike. You'll be back before roll call. It's a city bursting with lights. The "city of light" on every level. Bikes, motorbikes, and convertibles for everyone. It's splendiferous! The Champs-Elys?es for b?b?, the Tuileries for me, and for madame, Notre Dame. Is it a deal? Going once, twice, three times... No takers? Oh, someone's knocking. Have fun... you stick-in-the-muds! A little something from Paris. A bit of the city. Why were you up on deck?

You'll be back in an hour. Is it a deal? Going one, twice, three times... I'll carry you off. No takers? Two, three, four, five. The blonde. Spades again. I don't believe it. They weren't shuffled right. Nothing but spades. I'll deal another hand. You hear me? We're leaving. Leaving? We have another two days here. I decide, like I decided we'd leave La Villette last night. Oh, last night is the past, and the past is past. What have I done wrong now? Sure, I may stay out all night, but that's no reason. - This isn't because of you! - Who then? The missus. She's gone. Keep it down. The kid might hear. No need for him to know. Where did she go? I don't care. I just want to get away from here. She'll be back any minute now, or in an hour, or maybe tomorrow. Tomorrow? Five minutes and I wouldn't take her back. Let me rest. We planned on two days here. Then we'll go find her. Go find her? What's the use, you idiot? Who's boss here anyway? Get up on deck. We're leaving for Corbeil right now. Third-class to Corbeil. Fontainebleau! My train's leaving. Thank you. Third-class to Corbeil. Stop, thief! NOT HIRING Your move. Are we playin' or not? It's your turn, skipper! Your turn. Nice move. Now it's my turn. One, two, three... king me! Your turn now. Good. Now me. Even better. Bravo, skipper! Your turn now. You're white. Cheatin', eh? Then let's make it a fair fight. Your turn. You're black. Come on. Go on. Heck! Right when I was about to win. Of all the rotten luck! That ends the game. Crazy as a loon. If only this thing worked. Might take his mind off things. I thought I'd fixed it yesterday, but it needs more work. Sure... go on and laugh. There are stranger things than playing a record with your finger. Electricity... ya know what that is? Well, then? And can you explain the wireless? Then just keep quiet. There's a lot you don't know. All right, now. Where's my oilcan? Did you put that spring there? It doesn't belong there. It's working! It's working! Go get the skipper! Go on. It works real good. The skipper jumped in the water! Jumped in the water? He jumped in the water? He jumped in? Where? You sure you saw him jump? He can't have drowned. He knows how to swim. You gave us a fright! Go change, damn it! Well? Were you catchin' some fish? I thought you were catchin' some fish. So you weren't? Were you catchin' some fish? Get his jacket. He wanted to catch some fish. Let's put a record on. Go get the phonograph. I'll show you my latest invention. - Skipper, we're here! - We're in Le Havre! Skipper, we're here! Well? Where's he off to now? Another drunken sailor. A drunken sailor? How'd you like a sock in the jaw? Son of a... Come on. We gotta go. Ya hear? We gotta get back. We're in a fix now. Head office wants to see us. We got a summons. And who'll straighten it out? Me, as usual! All because of that hussy! You coulda shaved. It don't look proper. You stay here. All right. It wasn't your business. What are you anyway? - A nobody. - A nobody? That's right. Then go collect your pay and get lost! No, I want everything that's comin' to me. - All of it? - Yes. Is the skipper of L'Atalante here? I'll make quick work of him too! Ah, there you are. You there, second in command... come in here. No, just you. Shut the door. I have no time to waste. It's true... we're nobodies. Waiting your turn? Better hurry. The cashier closes at 6:00. Is the skipper of L'Atalante doing his job or not? Well... Are the documents in this file just a joke? Maybe not a joke, but idle talk. You saying he commands the barge? Careful now. You've been in trouble before, and not just with us. Don't you think I know that? That reminds me of a good one... Don't wriggle out of this. Is he in command or not? Who else would be in command? I certainly wasn't hired to do it, and the kid sure as heck don't blow the barge along! I mean... really... after all... you know... It's true. In my opinion, it's all a bunch of bunk! All right! We'll discuss it again later! I've got other problems besides L'Atalante. Sort things out with your skipper yourself. Sure. We'll discuss it again later. Well, see you then. Maybe sooner than you think! Right... This file's not my problem! Who do they take me for? It's going in the trash! The skipper of La Belle Am?lie! Loiselet, get in here! I've had enough of this! This won't take long. Good timing. The company almost fired the skipper. This can't go on. I'm gonna find the missus. You're gonna find the missus? Yes, I'm gonna find the missus. You seen the state he's in? I'm gonna go bring her back. - Now? - I ain't waitin' for Bastille Day! "The Latest Hit: 'The Bargemen's Song"' "The Bargemen's Song" We're on the barges to work, not to play Not to wander but to ply the canals all day Seated at the helm we're kings of the realm A pretty girl's smile May beguile us a while There may be hard times too But we'll see them through With a cheerful heart That's what bargemen do! P?re Jules went to find the missus? Yeah, he knows where she is. You swear? He's bringing her back? Get some water. Aye, aye, skipper. - Hurry. Watch the basin. - What now? Climb up there. Now pour! Here they come! P?re Jules and the missus are coming! The 1991 restoration, under the direction of Pierre Philippe and Jean-Louis Bompoint, was revised in 2001 by Luce Vigo and Bernard Eisenschitz in collaboration with Gaumont.
