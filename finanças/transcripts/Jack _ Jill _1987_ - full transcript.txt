I'll go ahead. I will see you tomorrow. Take care! Get in! Come! See you next time. Hey! Get in! We're leaving! Hey! Are you leaving? - Didn't you hear? - You're leaving? You really didn't hear? Crazy! What are you looking at? Are you mad at me? No, sir! I thought you are mad. Move! Move away! This guy hasn't learned. He just got out of jail. Fine! Move here! Hi, Jane! Smells good! Hey! Let's go! The ride is full! Let's go! I'm rushing! Sir, here's my payment. I bet she wants free fare. Ouch! Ouch! What are you doing there? What's happening? You're turning my jeep into a motel. Ouch! Ouch! I said ouch! Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! I said stop! What! Stop it! Stop! Where's your payment? Where do you think you're going? Hey! Why? - What do you mean? Pay me! - What payment? I got bruises but you still want me to pay you? No way! Pay me! I have nothing to give. What? Give me your payment! - Oh! You mean payment? - Yes! Take this! You really want to mess with me? Take this! You're shameless! You only have twenty five cents in your wallet! Money! Give me today's income! Give it now! May I ask a favor from you? A favor? Maybe you could give me a higher share? (Laughs) A favor? Oh! Sure. I'll give you something. A punch and a kick! So? You'll give money or I'll kick you? Good. Here, Miss. Where's yours? Here's mine. What? Very good. Here's mine. Very good, very good. Okay. Stingy! Heartless! As big as a whale! A hippopotamus! Greedy! (Laughs) Hey! Where's Ms. Coring? She's inside. Be careful, Jackylou. - Why? - The whale is cranky. Oh. But why? Is she the only one who can be cranky? I am cranky as well! Also, Kiko my friend. Can you not call me Jackylou? Jack is okay. Okay. But don't call me Kiko. You have a problem with it? None. However, I am not Kiko. My name is Imo. Oh, is that so? Sorry about that. It's just annoying. I had a drunk passenger and he didn't want to pay. I beat him up! I took his wallet. Can you guess how much he has? Twenty five cents! Then, I went to the wet market to buy food. What a bad luck! I got rotten tomatoes! And the most annoying of all, my daily income is short! So, there! Let not that wild boar mess with my temper. Or else, he will feel my wrath! That's not nice. True. It's all rotten. That's not what I meant. These darts. Aim for that stingy lady. Make my day. Have your fix! I don't need that. I have something better. These. Tomatoes? (Laughs) You whale! Shameless! What do you think? You think I don't know! (Shouts) She's comparing me to her cowardly son! Aim the target carefully. You shameless fat lady. You're so full of yourself! You've crossed the line. (Knocks) Hilario! (Knocks) Hilario!, come on! Jillian. Beautiful Jillian! Yes, my darling sister? Anything? Ouch! You're hurting me! Aren't you ashamed of your ways? Your waist is like a spinning top! Even a Ballerina will not win against you. You should be the one to change your lifestyle. And you should change your manly get up. Please! Don't try to meddle with my style. Just meddle with how you look like. We are Jack and Jill. Where did our parents go wrong? Oh! We are Jack and Jill. When we were born, even the angels in heaven laughed. Yes, honestly. Sister! Whatever! Why do you always dress up like that? Why don't you wear a lady's dress so you'll look human! Oh my gosh! I might have a miscarriage because of you. Ouch! And why does your face ended like that? Your makeup is too thick, you look like a corpse! You didn't even get ashamed of your look! Your face is just- We are Jack and Jill. Where did our parents go wrong? Oh! We are Jack and Jill. When we were born, all the angels in heaven laughed. The human race was so disturbed. The boy and girl bodies got confused! Oh no! We are Jack and Jill. Gorgeous! We are Jack and Jill. Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. That's it! Ouch! I'm gonna tell daddy! Daddy, look at my sister! She hits your pretty child, daddy! - What is it? Oh, come on! - I'm not doing anything! Why are you fighting again? She hit me with a drum! What drum? Which drum was it? You crazy liar! I'm getting mad already! Why do you act like dog and cat? You, you're overly playful! It's not me, it's her! (Imitates) Me? Be patient with your brother. Come on. Laryo, prepare her meal! She's cranky because she's tired. Call me Jillian and not Laryo. Okay, Jillian it is! Jillian, prepare your sister's food. Set the table. Yes, madame! The food will be prepared by my beautiful fingers. Daddy look! Hey Jackylou! Daddy, it's Jack! Oh, Jack. I never get your names right. Be more patient with him. You're the older sister. It must be the effect of upside down snails during your mom's pregnancy. He's really annoying! He has a woman's heart. He made my bad day even worse. I almost screwed things up with Ms. Coring earlier. What happened between the two of you? Nothing dad. We're good now. That's right my child. Thank you for not messing with Ms. Coring. You know what? Aside from being the operator of the jeepney you are driving, the one which earns you money, you're still paying her for the loan you used to own the jeepney. Now. Once you've paid her fully and you own the jeepney already, Hit her with your jeepney! I don't understand, Dad. I am confused. Considering that I pay the loan principal to her. But I am still obliged to give her my daily income. That's because she's greedy! Hey, madame. Your food is served. Look at how rude he is! There's nothing else we can do to him. Your brother is gay. Gay! Gay! He has chicklog! What chicklog? A female with egg. Daddy! We can still do something, Dad. Nothing else! - There is! - Nothing else! There still is! What has gotten in to your mind? Dad. I'm going to talk to all of my die hard suitors. Whoever can turn Hilario into a real man. You will marry me? Let's go! Hey, wait! Wait! I said I will marry the guy who can change my brother's attitude. I know, and it's me! What do you want me to do? Turn him into a good person? Or an ill-tempered one? You said change his attitude, right? We can probably turn him into a lazy person. That gay is so hardworking. Or you can also turn him into- A man! A man? That's not possible. I think it will be easier for Rizal to dance than to do what you want. It's not possible, Jackylou. Baldo! My name is Jack! Okay? Okay! Keep that in mind! Okay, Jack. But what you're asking for is impossible. This is sad. I got so much faith in you. I didn't realize you can't do it. I thought, since you're the toughest person in this place, you'll be able to turn Hilario into a man. Just like me. I have to go! But Jack, Jack wait. It's not that I can't do it. In fact, it is very easy. Are you sure you're going to make your promise? Of course. Name your church. Just change him. Great! I can start with it tomorrow. I'll turn him into the likes of Rambo. Or Rocky, maybe. It should be easy! It's up to you, just turn him into man. Laryo! Come here! (Sings) Laryo! I'm calling you. Don't you hear me? Yuck. Jillian! Oh! Jillian the beautiful! Oh gosh! Yes, my darling sister? Anything you want? Sandwich, soda, bread, peanut, or popcorn? You must really have crabs in your brain already! You wouldn't come here unless I call you Jillian! Jillian the beautiful! I should not be called ugly Jillian because I'm pretty. Hey, get over here. Take your clothes off! So I can see your body. I must be right, you like me and not my sister. Ouch! I said take the shirt off. Are you taking it off or not? Why do you want me naked? So Baldo can see your body! Faster! Remove the shirt! Here? Take it off already! Here you go. Like a virgin. Just for the very first time. Look at how crazy you are! Why? Is this your first time seeing this? Look what we have here. Your chest looks like a ukelele. I know. Okay, be ready for tomorrow. We'll do something. Really? Yes. We're going to jog. What? Why, Baldo? Aren't you happy with our first date? Crazy! You, too, are crazy. Hey, Baldo! What happened? Where is he? There, over there! Hello, sister who sometimes looks like a brother. Good morning! Why do you have an umbrella? You really have a dysfunction in your brain! You think you're funny yet you're not even bald. For sure you just want to make an impression with Baldo. You're just jealous with my style. Hey! I might as well punch you. - That hurts! - Go inside! Prepare our breakfast! Do you want to be alone with Mr. Macho? You really are crazy. Okay, Baldo. Bye! Crazy! So, Baldo. Thank you. Jack, wait! Your promise, okay? Yes, I know. Just turn my crazy brother into a man. Okay, then. I think I'll grow old trying. Laryo! Make it faster! You're bickering again. Oh, dad! Who died? What do you mean who died? You look like you're going to a wake. What? Of course not! It's because, someone told me that there is an opening in the village. Opening? What do you mean opening? My sibling, you don't know what opening means? Like an opening! Like a grand opening! Grand opening! Dad. Just this time, please? I'll give a medium hit so he would come to his senses. Stop! My hunky brother! Pardon my beauty in this morning. You'll go back to your senses when you know what opening means. I eagerly wanted to know but you're always interrupting! Your brother is referring to a job opening for driver. Driver? Who will apply, you? Yes. So, what's wrong with it? You're a woman and can drive, so am I because I'm a man. I'm still strong and able! And most of all, I want to help you because I feel for you. I want to help you with your payments for the jeep. And the salary will be two thousand per month. What? That is if I get hired. Think positive, Dad. Not negative! It's a beautiful day and so I. The sun shines brightly and the birds sing like- Hey, get out of your house! Get out of there! You crazy family! Get out of your house! Don't hide! Hey Jackylou! Hey, Ms. Coring it's you. What brought you here so early? I know I'm early but you're overly late! What do you mean late? Remember our agreement that you'll pay me every end of the month? Yes! Yesterday is the month-end. I'm sorry, Ms. Coring. My income has not been good lately. Especially yesterday, it was bad. What? You were luckier. If not for the fact that Junior has a crush on you! Mom, I don't. What? Of course you do! Your mom knows better! And you, Jackylou. You owe me a lot! You should pay already! Family of crazies! Hey! I think you're crossing the line. Why do you have to involve my family? I don't understand. It's clear, sister. It's as clear as the sun rays. That she's ugly, fat, and greedy! Queen of whales! Hey! Gay! I'm not talking to you! Give your payment! Ms. Coring! My daughter was trying to explain. Why won't you listen? The neighbors are watching! What's with calling us names? What if I call you moby dick, would you like it? Huh? It's shameful! You should be ashamed! You beggars! Pay me! Wait! Ms. Coring! Ms. Coring! That's already foul! You've crossed the line! Go Laryo, do what you need to do! Charge! Go! Fight them! Hit her! Ouch! Ouch! Don't destroy my clothes! (Indistinct chatter) Mommy! Enough already! -Mommy! Mommy! (Indistinct chatter) There fighting here. (Indistinct chatter) Enough! -You pig! What pig? Who's a pig? You! And who do you think you are? Little red riding hood. You... Enough! Take her away from here. At least move her far. You should! If she starts again, I'm going to pull her hair! Stop it. -Stop fighting. Your son is too much! Go, move him away! Don't get affected. Stop it. Okay. -How dare her. Ask for forgiveness from Ms. Coring. Let's leave. There's no need to apologize, just pay your dues! We can now pay you because I already have a job. Yes. We are rich now! Whatever. Seriously! Your payment, okay? Let's go, son. You better go now. More people are watching. Okay. We are okay now. You might still be mad? I am mad? When did I ever get mad? All I want is for you to pay dues. Son, say goodbye to Jackylou. Say goodbye now. Come on, son. Say it. Okay. Alright. Pay your dues. Later! Later. Go on. She really is greedy. Where are you going? Who let you in? Your security guard. I have an appointment with Mrs. Bartolome. Oh, You're Mr. Ambo? Yes. I was instructed by madame to let you proceed to lanai. Come in, Mr. Ambo. Hurry. Over here. Evelyn, they are leaving. Okay, that's how life is. You get unlucky sometimes. I might also be fired next week. Over here, Mr. Ambo. Let's get going. Why were they fired? Just sit first. I said why were they fired? Because some of the couple's possessions were sequestered. That's why we're being fired one by one. There are only three of us now. Do they still need a driver? Mr. Ambo, you're lucky! Me? Lucky? Madame is early today. I'll go now, just wait for her. Who are you? Good day, ma'am. Buenas. Buenas, ma'am. I was recommended by Atty. Villaluz. Oh! You must be Ambo. You're recommended to me as a driver. Yes, ma'am. I am Donya Estrella Bartolome. But they call me Star. Oh. Yes. You mean you're the one singing with a wonderful voice earlier? Yes, that was me. The name that they call you suits you well. (Laughs) Well, quite a number of people already said that. If that so- Ouch! That means we are good together. What? Tsuper (driver), superstar. I never thought you're fond of throwing jokes that are not laughable. Are you sure you can drive? We are a family of drivers. My grandfather used to drive for Manuel Quezon. My great great grandfather drove for Emilio Aguinaldo. I never thought I'll drive for a singer. Oh, Ambo! Would you like sandwich? Coffee? Or tea? Work should be fine. Ambo, you're hired! Thank you. (Disgusts) That's not okay for me. Lift it higher! Higher! You have to lift it above your head! Baldo, I do not do things like this. It's not good for a Filipina like me to lift weights like this. I'll have bigger muscles. You're right, but you're not a Filipina. You're more like a local fish called dalagang bukid. Now, lift it! Lift! When I met you- Ouch! Why did you hit me? I can't do it anymore! It's stressful! I'm better with the Gloria Diaz effect. There! That's one other thing you are messing up. Who? Gloria Diaz? No, the way you talk. It's so feminine, so soft, so light! Isn't it sexy? Stupid! How will you be a man if you're like that? You should stiffen your tongue. But how? Let me show you. Say, rock. Rock. It's not like that. Say it harder. Rock! Even harder? Yes. Rock! I'm going to hit you. Say it louder and harder! The rock! Stone! You're really not gonna do it? This is gonna cause me my life! Die then! What? Hey. What? Let's do deep breathing to make your chest bigger. Oh, I like that. Face me. Hands on your waist. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. What's wrong with you? When I say inhale, breathe in and hold it. Sustain it! Hold it until I say exhale. Understand? Yes, I get it. Otherwise, I'll hit you. Now. Do it. Inhale. Hold it. Good. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Hey, how are you doing there? Jack. What now? Jack, take a look. Your brother will soon be a man. Can you not remind me of our agreement again? I'm marrying the guy who can change my brother, okay? Jack. I don't want you to marry someone first. I'm investing hard work here. Baldo, you're way ahead of my other suitors. I haven't told them about my condition. Besides, you're the toughest among them, right? Yes. I will leave you here, okay. But Jack. What? Jack. What? I'm on the lead, okay? Yes, you are. I'll go ahead to Ms. Coring. I'll ask for my payment's extension. I don't know what happened to dad's job hunt. I'll get going. Okay, as long as I'm leading. Yes! Jillian! So you're here! Hey gay, are you going to the market or not? I'm really not sure. You mean... you were lying about your father's job? I'm really not sure. Ms. Coring. Regarding to my dues for the jeep. Don't worry about it. It can wait. Let me call Junior, okay? What? I still have to drive. It can wait. Junior! Junior! Yes, mommy? Go down, Jackylou is here. Later. What do you mean later? Jackylou is here! Go down! Let me leave you two alone. Okay. Come here! There. Attack! That's the kind of girl you need. You'll have a wife and a bodyguard. Okay. I'll leave you two alone. Oh, by the way. When Junior visits you later, hand him your payment, okay? But I thought- Jackylou. I apologize for my mom. When it comes to money, she doesn't let anything pass. I know. She looks like Lacoste already. What? Crocodile. Oh. Jackylou. I need to visit you later. Is it okay? It's all up to you. I still have to work. Okay. You know Junior? I think he wants to court me. What? I think he's coming today. Junior? Yes. But I will also tell that nerd about Laryo. You'll surely be a spinster. Say what dad? Nothing. I said- Cool. Here's the first. It's all up to you, you can handle that. Okay dad. Be careful. Hi Jackylou. It's Jack. Come in. Flowers for you. I know what those are. Come in. Junior! Sorry, Jackylou. This is my first time to do this. Mom forced me to. So, you're saying you don't like me? It's okay. No. I really want to. However. Here's the thing. I'll tell you this now. This is my condition to all my suitors. I'll get straight to the point. I will marry- Good evening, Jackylou. What's that? Oh, that's Rene. One of my suitors. I actually call him karaoke. Hey Rene! Come in! Hi. Good evening, Jackylou. Good evening. I brought new records for you. You might want to request a song. Yes, I do have a request. Just say it. Please turn off the karaoke. Why? Also. Can you be quiet for a while? Hello! Okay, Rene. Have a seat. Thank you. Good evening, Bobby. Good- Good eve- Good evening! Jacky- Jackylou. For- For me? Yes. Thank you. Get in. Get in, Bobby. Thank you. Bobby, meet Junior. You've already met Rene, right? Have a seat. Yes. Good evening, Jackylou. Why did you all come tonight? I'll just get you some drinks. - This is for you. - Just leave it there. Are you new here, buddy? My mom forced me to come. Good evening! Here's something to drink. Jack! Hey, Jimmy. Come in. Thank you. Tha- Thank you. For you, Jack. Thank you. Just leave it there. Oh! Okay. Even if you're all courting me, you also know that I can choose only one. To cut the chase, I have an announcement. I'll marry any of you, who can change my brother. What? That's crazy, why did you tell them? It's over? It's over. Okay, I'll go ahead. (Laughs) One down. Excuse me, Jack. I never had the chance to meet your brother. What do you want him to change? Wait. Laryo! Laryo! Jillian! Beautiful Jillian! Yes, my darling sister? Wow! What a delight! There. Make him a man. You must be Mr. Ambo? My wife said you're applying as our driver. Well, Mr. Ambo. I regret to inform you that- Mr. Ambo? Mr. Ambo? Mr. Ambo? Pardon me. I was prepared to meet your wife. I mean, her voice is- I understand, buddy. So, are you Mr. Ambo? Yes, I am. I want to say that I can start driving now. I'm sorry about my wife. She's so quick to decide. In fact, we're not in need of a driver. So, I'm sorry if your time was wasted. Oh, Chief! Mayor! Congressman! Senator! But Madame Star said I'm hired. You know what, Mr. Ambo. I am the boss here. When I say something, it is final. And I said, we don't need a driver. Oh, Mr. Ambo. You seem to have met my husband, Don Juanito Bartolome. Yes, ma'am. Juanito! What are those in your ears? Remove that. I must have left it there while cleaning my ears. Perhaps you already agreed on the terms? I choose him. Oh, sweetheart. We've already discussed who is the boss here. And that we don't need a driver. I already told you that our son needs a driver. But sweetheart, your son is already an adult. Besides, I'm the boss here, right? Yes. But the decision is in my hands. So, Mr. Ambo, you're hired. Am I right? Star! Juanito! You're hired. (Awkward laugh) Besides, we really need a driver for our son. Thank you. Our son is a reckless driver. He's so playful. You mean, I will be driving for your son? Are you deaf? I hope so. What? When will I start? As soon as our son arrives. Angelo? Wake up, the sun is out. Angelo, wake up! Come on. Hi. Where am I? Who are you? Angelo, I don't like that joke! It's already morning. I know, I need to go home. Why didn't you wake me up? I'm sure, my mom's looking for me. How can I? You have a deep sleep. Okay Aida, thank you very much. What? Who's Aida? My name is Susan! Huh? Oh, you're Susan. I'm sorry. I just remembered mom. Her name is Aida. Okay? Bye. Bye. Take care. - Thank you. - I'll see you. Senorito! Senorito! Please get my stuff in the car. Yes, sir! Wait a minute. Are my parents already awake? Yes, they've been looking for you. I think you're in trouble. You didn't come home again last night. Who said I didn't? I slept here last night. No, sir. I did sleep here last night. You saw me get midnight snacks in the kitchen. Oh, senorito! Okay, okay. Okay, get my stuff. Oh, senorito! Good morning mom, dad. - Good morning, mom. - Good morning, son. - Good morning, dad. - Morning morning? Where did you sleep again last night? Me? I slept here last night. I actually had a good sleep. Angelo, you weren't in your room last night. We know that. Oh! Maybe it was when I went downstairs for a snack. Evelyn even saw me. Where is she? Dad. The truth is, I'm having a trouble sleeping. I miss mom's love songs. Her lullabies. Oh, my son! why didn't you tell me? Mom, maybe later. - What? - Later, mom. At least. My son appreciates a good singing voice. He's just all praises because he has a sin. Say what? Okay, okay. Let's eat! By the way, Angelo. I have decided- (Coughs) Your mom has decided to give you a driver. Driver? Or spy? Don't say that, my son. Your mom is just worried about you. You mostly come home in the morning. That's dangerous! You're just behind the wheel. Mom, I'm old already. I can drive myself around. What? Having a driver is just a waste of time. How did you learn to talk to me like that, son? I really don't agree, mom. I don't want a driver. I won't have a driver now or ever. It's final. Mr. Ambo, I wish to arrive before Christmas. Am I too slow? No. You're too fast. Your mom told me, that I should drive slow if you're my passenger. Yes, mom said that we should be careful. Bus she didn't say to let me age inside the car. Then I will drive faster? Yes. That's the way! Mr. Ambo, do you have children? Oh, I have two. Two? Yes. So, you're weak. Oh, no. My wife was the one who's weak. No, you're the one who's weak. No, it was my wife, senorito. How was it possible? When our second child was born, my wife gave up. What do you mean? She passed away. Sorry, Mr. Ambo. Why didn't you remarry? I didn't have the chance to. I become both the mom and dad to my children. They must be good kids. Yes, they are two. You must not have any problem with them, right? Yes, they are two. Oh, do you have a problem? Good morning, Ms. Coring. Oh, Jackylou. Come! Come in, come in! Why? It's about- I'm here because of my supposed payment. It's kind of- I'm a little- Don't worry about it! If you want, we can settle it some other time. Do you have fever? None. You might want some snacks. We have coffee, rice cake, noodles, and maruya. Go, get some snacks. You really have a fever. None. I'm just happy. Junior told me about his visit to you last night. Is it true? You'll be his price if he gets to turn Hilario into a man? Oh, is that it? Junior can do that. Isn't it, son? I can't. Oh, he is really good in being funny. So, Ms. Coring. I'll just give my payment next time. Yes, give it next time. Thank you! I have to go, I still have work. Okay, okay. - Junior, walk her out! - No need to. She can manage it on her own. Hey! Come here. Here's what you will do, okay? Befriend that Hilario. You have to be really close friends. Understa- But mom, it isn't really like that. (Inaudible) Mr. Ambo. Make sure my parents won't learn about our whereabouts. What's there to be ashamed of? You're a bachelor. Besides, this is just your fourth destination. Just promise not to tell them. They thought I only have one girlfriend. Don't worry, I won't tell. Okay. Angelo! Susan! Who's Susan? It's Dolly! Dolly, I'm sorry. My mom's name is Susan. We had a fight earlier. -Really? I'm sorry. It's okay. How are you? I missed you my baby. I miss you so much. Let's go inside? Come on, you close the door. Naughty with girls, right? He really is! Why do you seem excited? No. I just find the fool entertaining. But, he's okay. He's polite. Good? But he's a womanizer! If I'm the one he cheated on, I'll give him bruises. Maybe you'll swallow what you said. Since I thought about food. Do we have any? I'm hungry. Wait, I'll prepare your food. Thank you. Curse that gay, he still left. Hey! How was your problem with- How was your problem with all your suitors? Most of them left. Only Baldo has remain his hopes for Hilario. It's not like I'm meddling with your affairs... It just seems to be a very huge price to pay. Think about it. You will marry Baldo? Just to make your brother- I'm so desperate, Dad. That's how desperate I am. Don't worry about me, I know what I'm doing. Oh well, please sit down. Wow! Gabby Concepcion is really handsome! He's really my type! I don't like him. Maybe he's a member of our gay association. Hey, sis! It isn't fake, okay? His muscles are really big and hard! How did you know? He got four movies, you know? I like Tonton Gutierrez more. You fools! Can you stop that flirtatiousness? Or else I'll cut you with an ax! And my sister who looks like a brother is angry again. I will crush your face into pieces. Hey! And you, Manny, why are you here? Go home! And you, Junior. Why are you with these gays? They wanted me to be a man. He suggested to watch Rambo, but we can't find it, so we watch another film. I'm not talking to you. Hey Junior! Can you bring this bad influence to his home! And you're a lesbian! Junior, let's go home! Bye sis! Hey, eat here. No, thanks. I need beauty sleep, and I might dream of Gabo. And I might destroy my waist line. (Hums) Is it true, Angelo? Yes, it's true. I love you so much. - You're so sweet! - It's because I'm with you. And when I'm with you, my heart beats and says you're my only love. Really, Angelo? No one else? No one else, Julie. You're the only woman for me. Say that again. Later, let's shoot the ball first. Okay? Nice and soft. See that! Good girl! Good girl! Say that again. I love you my one and only. Typical Angelo. You're so good with jokes. I'm not joking. If you want, let's seal with another kiss. Why not? Come back Darling, okay? Sure. Darling? Come back, okay? Yes, even everyday. Okay? I'll go now. Bye bye. Bye. Mr. Ambo! Mr. Ambo! (Shouts) It's morning already, let's go. Do you see that? Yes. It's your turn. Me? Yes. Bend it! More! I can't do it. Why not? It's hard. Go! Just go! I can't. Do it yourself. I'll hit you with this. There you go. Do it again. There. I quit! I quit! Hey! Come on! Come here. Lift it up! Right. Not like that. Harder! Aim for my face. Why did you throw the gloves? I told you to punch straight. Okay, fight. Make your right hand higher. There! Punch straight. Why do you bend it? Keep it straight! (In pain) Pull, release. Okay, your turn. I don't like it. What? I can't do that. What? That one! I told you I can't do this! I also can't afford to lose! Go, do it! Okay! Yes, like that. Attack! (Coughs) Dad. What? Why do you look pale? I'm just tired. My senorito. I told you you'd be in trouble! You're not being careful! No, you don't understand. I'm actually entertained. What? You know what, daughter? That person? A lot of girls really like him. He even beat a fish with lots of fish bones! He will be caught soon! That's impossible! He's impossible to be caught. He's smart. Really smart. Pull! More! Go on, pull! More. More! Pull even more! I saw you yesterday in a sports center! You were carrying a new golf set. I wanted to say hi but you already left. I bought a gift for my new boyfriend. What were you doing there? I bought a new tennis racket for my boyfriend. Is that Aida? Hey! Hi. I'm surprised to see you. You're the one who surprised us. Come on, join us! - Let's just go to our table. - Are you with someone? Yes, you know him. He's Ismael. He wants to join me and I just let him. So we won't argue. You are classic, such a playgirl! Hey! I'm not that anymore. You know why? I met someone and I think I'm in love. Well, that calls for a celebration. Because Julie and I have also met ours. Is that so? Let's just go to our table. Here, here. Ismael, look who's here. There were my classmates before. You already met them, right? Julie and Flora? Hi. Hello. Take your seats and eat. Is everything okay? Have you eaten? Yes, we're done. Hi guys. Hi girls. Dolly is here. Hi Susan! Happy birthday! Did you arrive early? How are you? I told you we will all see each other here. Hi! Susan, you didn't tell me that you've invited them. I have my reasons, Dolly. Okay. Hey, let's talk. Let's go. Excuse us, Ismael. Why? It's important. This is gonna be exciting! Mr. Ambo? I feel dizzy. What? You're dizzy? Do you frequently feel it? (Coughs) Yes, frequently. Have you consulted a doctor? Doctors are expensive. Don't worry, I'll accompany you to a doctor tomorrow. Thank you, senorito. No worries. Okay, I'll just take the wheel. What? We only have one boyfriend? Unbelievable but true! He fooled all of us, that womanizer Angelo! How did you know? Look, girls. You can't hide something smelly. The odor will always leak! And now, we can get even with him. How? Tonight, Angelo is my very special guest. Here's what we'll do. Hi. Hello. Angelo! Susan! My love! I thought you'll not show up. Of course not! That's the last thing I would ever do. When I say I'll be there, I will be there. Isn't that the same line that you told me? Aida? What are you doing here? (Panics) You fool! You're a cheater! Animal! Dolly! Get him! You're an animal! Shame on you. Come back here! You'll see! (Shouts) You just need to rest, Mr. Ambo. Just buy my prescribed medicines. Okay. Hi darling. Darling. Angelo! Hi Doc! Have you met my wife? Your wife? No, not yet. I was just about to introduce myself. Hi. Hello. I'm Angelo Bartolome. Nice to meet you. Doc, how is Mr. Ambo? I'm okay, sir. He has high blood pressure. Rest. That's what he needs. Otherwise, he won't last until Christmas. Is that so? What now? Boss, please don't tell your parents about this. Or else, I will be fired. You know how badly I need this job. It's bad if you'll continue to drive. Don't worry. I'll take care of all your expenses, including your medicines. Mr. Ambo? Why are you staring at me? Because you're amazing, boss. You are a good person. But, I do not need charity. I'll just rest for a few days. Then I'll come back to work. It's okay. However, Mr. Ambo. I can't stop mom from hiring a substitute driver. You know how badly she wants to keep an eye on me. Oh, let's go. Boss. Remember when you told me that if I want something, I'll ask you and you'll help me? Yes, I remember. But when it comes to mom, I can't do anything. I'm sure she'll find a replacement for you. Replacement? Boss, I have a child. A learned driver. He can replace me temporarily while I'm resting. Is he good? Very good. Not a gossiper? Definitely not. Alright, Mr. Ambo. Take care of it. Okay, sir. Thank you, senorito. I'm sure my child will be glad. Sorry boss, I drank it- I'm not glad daddy! No, I do not want to drive. What's wrong with being a driver? I and your sister are drivers! You can drive! It doesn't suit my beauty. I'll be insane because of you! When will you ever be a man? You're starting to sound like my sister. You're dreaming the impossible! You know that I'm trapped in a man's body. You're like her. Hey! I heard my name again. What's the problem? It's daddy! He has hypertension and wants me to replace him in driving. Oh, that's great! So, you'd be forced to be a man. Very good! Very good? That's very bad! I do not want to! I don't feel like it! My muscles are going to get big. I don't want to! Is he the one? Yes, ma'am. Is he the one who's going to drive for my son? Yes, ma'am. Si Jack, I mean Rocky. Rocky? Yes ma'am, Rocky. But Jack is my nickname. Not so close? I think he's very young for such big responsibility. Especially driving for my Angelo! I'm a great driver, Ma'am Star. You're the one my daddy always tells me about. The great Primadonna. My dad said you've got excellent voice! He said that? Here we go again. Star, sweetheart... Didn't you just say that she's too young to drive for- Are you an alto or a baritone? Soprano. Wow! Oh, that's the hardest! I'm sure you're good. Can we hear you sing? Oh, yes! Excuse me, I'll go to the restroom. (Sings) Mr. Ambo, you need to hear this. (SIngs) Mr. Ambo, is this the driver you're telling me about? (SIngs) Ah, this is Jack. I'm Angelo. How are you buddy? Are you really a good driver? Yes. Mom, she's hired right? So Mr. Ambo can rest. Of course. He's good because he knows how to appreciate music. Okay buddy, you can start. Okay, sir. I'll just go swimming. Okay. Dad, I have to inform Ms. Coring. Okay then. It's okay. It's okay. And I cannot pay for my dues yet, so I'll lend the jeepney to you. It's okay. It's okay. As long as Junior is allowed to visit you. No worries at all. I'll get going, I'm in a hurry. Okay. You take care. Mommy. Son. Are you still trying to court Jackylou? What? Yes, mom! I'm also befriending his brother and his friend Manny. You also said- Oh! That's both our plan, right? It looks like you've got blood on your lips? What? Go and gargle. Go and gargle! Yes, mommy. Buddy, is the car well-conditioned? Very well, sir! It can climb the mountains of Baguio. Good. Let's go to Baguio. Why? You've climbed up to Baguio, right? Yes, but I did not bring extra clothes. No problem. We'll head back tomorrow. So, what time are we leaving? Right now. I'll just go to the casino. Let's go. Good evening, sir. Thank you. Jack. I'd be so unlucky if my girlfriends will still find me here. I know, senorito. Senorito, I'll just go to the gas station. Then, I'll try to find a space to park. Okay. Go get the tank full. Yes, sir. Here's 800, is that okay? This is too much, sir. No worries. Use the change to buy your dinner. Thank you, sir. I hope you'll win. Okay, thank you Jack. I'm sorry, buddy. I just need this. Give me the key. Okay. If that's what you want. Oh, unfortunately there are police behind you! What? Here! here! Call the police! Jack, what happened? He's my boss, Mr. Bartolome. How are you, chief? You're lucky to have a brave driver. If not, your car would have been stolen. Please sign here. Now, you will have to file complaints. That's a bit of trouble. There are witnesses, right? Yes, there is. The attendant. Okay, take care of it chief. Okay. Since you already signed the affidavit, and your driver gave your address, we'll just get in touch with you. Okay, sir! Can he go now? Sure. Let's go, Jack! Be careful, buddy. Thank you, chief. Okay. You amazed me Jack. You're not just a good driver but a good bodyguard. (Smirks) It's not a big deal, senorito. Let's go. Are we going back to the casino? Not anymore. I already won. But with the bravery you've shown, we'll have a good time. I'll treat you out. Come! Good evening, Mr. Bartolome. Manager! Manager, this is my buddy Jack. How are you? I'm good. Every time I go to Baguio, I stop by this place. Oh, take the presidential table. Okay. Oh, my friend. Hey, what's wrong with you! Is it as usual, Mr. Bartolome? Manager, tonight is special. Give us champagne and your most delicious food. Your house special. Sure, boss. - For your buddy. - Okay. Come here. Senorito, senorito. I don't drink. Jack, we are buddies right? But buddy, I really don't drink. I know, your dad told me that you don't have vices. But tonight, I'll give you your first. You don't know what you're missing, buddy. Watch this. Why don't you sleep in your room? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Is it good on me? Crazy! I don't know what to do with you! Then go to sleep. The angels might sleep ahead of you. Monkey! Your sister is out at two in the morning! She's trying to make a living. And here you are, taking life lightly! Hey! Tomorrow, before the angels wake up, get up and find a job. Understand? But daddy, what- That's final! Aren't you ashamed? Better change your attitude! Your sister is sacrificing! She'll marry- I already know that! Is it my fault that she's looking for an excuse to be a spinster? Hey, don't think that way. She's probably having a hard time now. And here you are, having a bad mouth. I know my boss. On the very first day, he'll give you a taste of pain. Where? Oh, here. Here, Jack. Thank you. Hello, Jack. Senorito. What is this? I told you I'll give you a good time. Here's your take home. But the dawn's breaking. That's okay. I have your back, Jack. Not a problem at all. Go, go ahead. Go Jack, attack! What? Just let me. I'll sleep here. No, sir. I'll sleep here. It's obvious that you're a virgin. Go now. Consider this as a gift. But it's not even my birthday. Besides, I'm so sleepy. I'm so sleepy already. What's wrong with you? Get up there so you'll be awake. Go ahead Jack, leave me here. Goodbye! Boss, why don't you go up? I'm really sleepy. But that's a gift for you. Come, I'll watch you. Oh, no. Don't! I will go with you and watch. I'll just go on my own. (Grins) Come here Jack, I'm waiting. Yuck! You wait on your own! Crazy! Don't talk to me. What, are you gay? Hey! Don't start with me or I'll hit you! I've got so many things in my head so don't mess with me! You don't want me? Fine! Hey Laryo! Where's your sister? She's not home yet. I need to talk to her. I said she's not home yet! I'm not a lost and found section to find someone missing! I got so many problems. I've got bigger problems! I need to do this against my will because you're gay. Go, get inside! Practice. Make that body bigger. Practice again? Go, get inside already! Inside! Joanna! Hello girls! You know what, I almost got caught by my mom. Oh, you see Baldo? Join us! Look at Joanna, award-winning! You can't turn Jillian into a man. She wants an easy life. You're disgusting! Hey Laryo! Whatever happens, I'll turn you into a man. Go, change your clothes! We'll practice. I'll wait at the back. Wow! Training again! Sickening! Why do you look so down? He's problematic. You're pregnant? Stupid! He's not capable. How can he be? Let's open it! His problem is, He's being asked to find a job. Then go find a job. I'll just runaway. Yes! I'll just runaway. I'll show them that I can live on my own! Stubborn. Jack, did you have fun? Yes, it was good. I enjoyed it. But I think you hit the jackpot. What? Cathy! Oh! It could be. You know, you should swim so you'll not be sleepy. What? Senorito. Take your jacket off. No, senorito. Take it off. Come on. I'll let you borrow my shorts. No, it's okay. Jack, come on. Go swim. I can't, it's okay. It's okay, sir. It's okay, senorito. I know. I know why you don't want to swim. What? You're caught. What do you mean, caught? You don't want to swim because you don't know how to. (Laughs) Oh yes, I don't know how to swim. Soon, I'll teach you how to swim. Goodbye kitchen. Goodbye living room. Goodbye door. Goodbye house. Mr. Driver. This is my stop. Here's my payment. Excuse me. Ouch. Juanito! Ouch! My hips! Oh! This is awful! Juanito! Ouch! Why did you suddenly crossed the street? Juanito this is your fault! Let's take him to the hospital! (Cries) Move! (Cries) Let's carry him. Let's carry him! Carry- Are you in pain? You're so pretty. But you're not being careful! That's true. Come here, let's go to the hospital. Slowly! Slowly! Senorito, I'll go ahead. Wait. Come to my room first. Go on, go on! Wow! You've got a beautiful house, Dona Star! Not really. Being humble doesn't suit you. Juanito! Get his stuff because he'll stay with us. That's too much, Star! The doctor said she got minor injuries. Be thankful nothing serious happened. Otherwise, you're screwed. Go on, fix the guest room! Get that! Give me that! Come, I'll let you explore our house. (Giggles) Is it possible if you'll stay here tonight? It's okay even if forever. Do you have a child? Yes, a boy. And he's handsome. Handsome? Yes. (Laughs) Do you know how to massage, Jack? Oh, yes Senorito. I usually massage my dad whenever he gets body pain. I see. Give me a massage. What, sir? Come on. Even for a while. I just feel pain in my joints. But, senorito. Senorito, it's getting late. I'll still have to buy medicine. The pharmacy might be closed. I'll go ahead! Okay then, just be early tomorrow. Yes, sir! Jack! Senorito! Nothing sir, I was just shocked. Where did you and Angelo go? At the gym, sir. - I'll go ahead. - Wait, Jack. How is Mr. Ambo? He's still a bit sick. - I'll go now, senorito. - For a moment, Jack. I'll just ask for a favor. If you don't mind. Okay, sir. What is it? We have a visitor tonight. But the floor is a bit dusty in the guest room. Our maids are already resting, maybe you can- - You want me to clean it? - If you don't mind. Sure, of course I won't mind it sir. My back is starting to hurt now. The dustpan is there. Wait. Don't come inside yet. It's still being cleaned. We aren't going to the guest room, Papa. What? Papa? Why? Where are you going? In our bedroom. We will listen to music, like opera. You know what Juanito? She's also into music and arts. And you know what? He doesn't have parents anymore. Now? It's been a while. My dad was shot dead in Bataan. Terrible! While my mom also died during the EDSA revolution. She was selling sampaguita near Malacanang. She was unaware of the chaos and the stampede. Terrible! Don't continue your sad stories anymore. Let's go! Let's listen to Pavarotti. Bye Papa. Bye. So why did that gay runaway? I don't know. Perhaps he was irritated. I told him to find a job. But it's good for him. We had an argument. He's so sensitive. She got a woman's heart. Gay. Don't worry, dad. Tomorrow, I'll ask Baldo to find him. You're so kind, my child. I'm just worried about his whereabouts. I'm worried about your brother. I know he's sleeping on the sidewalk. He's tilling the garbage because he's hungry. Don't be shy, just eat. You might want to save some for us. Juanito! Don't mind him. Just continue eating, get your stomach full. There's so much food here. There are still fried chicken and roasted pig. They're all tasty. Really? And the crabs are huge. Those are not crabs, it's called prawns. Oh, prawns? Try it. Mom, it might be embarrassing. It really is embarrassing. Juanito! I'm also hungry. Stop it. Go on dear, don't mind him. Just eat. Mom. Didn't you tell me that you have a handsome son? Morning mom, morning dad. I didn't know we have a visitor. Oh, son. He is- Jillian. I'm Angelo. Mom, I didn't know you were looking for a new maid? She's not looking for a job. She's our visitor. A friend! Your dad's car bumped him last night. Are you done eating? Yes. I am actually full. Okay, come to my garden. I'll show you my flowers. I'll join you if you'll sing a song for me. Of course! You are so good. Come on! It's really romantic here at Parks and Wildlife. You took me here on our first date, right? Yes. Oh, How are you? I'm okay. Why do you have a bodyguard? Bodyguard? That's just Jack. She just finds you sexy. Jack! Come out from there. Why senorito? Come here. Jack, this is Bella. Isn't she sexy? What? I said Bella is sexy. If you say so. Why? Isn't it obvious? I don't know. Just let him, he's still ashamed of girls. Do you know someone she can date? Perhaps one of your model friends. You think it's possible? Why are you befriending your driver? Jack? He's different! He's cool. So, can you hook him up for a date? If you want- There's no need to, senorito. You know Jack, I'm having doubts about you. Are you gay? Gay? Wait. Jack. Can you wait in the car? Oh! Okay, sir. Thank you. Jack, why? A cat crossed the street, sir. What? Yes, sir! I'm so sorry. Let's go then. Jack! What's wrong? Didn't you see the goat crossing? - Goat? - Yes, sir! I'm so sorry, senorito. Okay. Let's go now. Ouch! Jack! Don't tell me it's a carabao this time. No, senorito. The engine stopped. I'll move the car at the side. What happened? The engine just stopped. Let's try to start the car. It's not working? It's not working, senorito. So what now? What do we do now? Okay, try to start the engine again. You may have a luxurious car, but it needs to be pushed! So cheap! I'm really sorry, Bella. (Breathes heavily) Because you didn't get to start the car, you sleep in there. I'll sleep here. Come, Bella. Oh, it worked! It's working now, senorito. Bella. I'll go ahead. So I could change my clothes. But you said you'll sleep here? He's really sweaty, he needs to change. I'm not talking to you. Go ahead. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay? Okay. Bye. Good night. Let's go, Jack. Good night. My maids, I'd like you to meet your new boss. He's Jillian. Understand? Oh, mom. Yes? Tell them what happened because they might be surprised. I would like you to know that I and Don Juanito are adopting this pretty- lady. This young lady! (Laughs) Good afternoon, ma'am. Oh, Jack. I'd like you to meet your new senorita. He's Jillian. (Smirks) Jillian? Okay, ma'am. You two know each other? Eh- Anyway, she'll be the sister of Angelo. What? Why? I and Don Juanito will adopt him. But that's not possible. Mom, why do you let her talk that way? Oh! No! No! It can't be. I gathered all of you here to meet your new boss. Okay. After the birthday party for Angelo, our adoption will be official with this child. (Grins) Okay! Back to work! Oh, my vocal chords will break with these people. Laryo! Oh! Sister! Oh gosh! Ouch! Give me back my hair! You shameless animal! You bring so much danger! Give my hair! Do you know dad's condition? Do you also know what you did to Junior? He's also gay now! And what is this show? Give me that! Don't you understand what I said? You're worrying about this wig! (Cries) Give my hair back! That's mine! You're insane! This must be from four people who cut their hairs and combined together! Even then, that's still my hair! Give it back! No! We'll go home. Let's go! We'll go home! Hilario! Ouch! I said we're going home! Let's go! No! I'll be adopted. What if they find out your a boy? But they wouldn't. What if I tell them? Don't! Give that to me! You're really shameless, Laryo! We will all get in trouble! We will ruin things in the couple. Even I will look bad to Angelo! Oh, Angelo! Your tone, sister. What's the tone? The eyes. Why do they twinkle like stars whenever Angelo is mentioned? Are you really out of your mind? My darling sister. Those who are sensitive can easily notice. There. If you want, let's talk to Angelo. Let's tell him I'm a man. While you are a real woman who's dressing up like a man. What? Are you out of your mind? Jack! Oh, that's senorito! Give me that! Quick! Wear it! Faster! Jack! Give me that! You can have this! Faster! Jack! Oh, senorito. Just a moment! Jack! So what now? One moment, senorito. Jack! You're like an animal! Jack! Wait a minute! (Coughs) You're really patient, Jack. What? Do you like my soon to be sister? What? Don't deny it, the hair says it all. Don't worry, it's okay. I think you're okay to be an in-law. Oh, let's go! We still need to fetch Bella. Okay, sir. You're really extraordinary. Bella, huh? So, my sister is a girl after all. I can see love in her eyes. I envy her. Gosh! My hair! (Panics) What? Adoption? That's what Dona Star plans to do. Jackylou. That's not possible. Don't worry, I will not let it happen. Good thing you didn't tell the truth or else we'll all be in trouble. I'm just waiting for the right timing, dad. I figured out. We should have left him in the hospital when he was born. And that's not all dad. You should have sued the doctor. Such a pest. Daughter. Take care of your brother. You know I trust you fully. Okay, Dad. You rest now. I have to go back to Angelo. So you're calling him Angelo now? Oh- Forget it. Don't try to explain. Yes, dad. Okay. Jackylou. It's Jack, dad. Jack. Yes, dad? Just hit your brother once for me. I'll hang him, dad. Your voice is wonderful. Sing one more! Oh, thank you! It's so perfect! - Really? - Yes! Oh, okay. Good evening, senorito. Senorito. What? Good evening, sir. Where's Senorito Angelo? He's at the garden, go to him. Thank you. Senorito, I'm here. Oh, Jack. We are not leaving anymore. You just rest. Why? Is there a problem? None. I am the problem. What, sir? There's nothing happening. With what, sir? Can you not be so polite? Okay, sir. You're still very polite. You know, Jack. I'm tired of being a playboy. I think, I'm ready to meet the woman I'm going to marry. What about Bella? Don't make me laugh, Jack. I'm just her sometimes. Who's the lucky girl? I don't know yet. But I have an agreement with God. Agreement? You might think I don't believe in God. I didn't say that. Our agreement was really nice and clear. What's the agreement? That, he'll give me a sign when the right girl comes. Signs? What signs? Well, I know what I want in a woman. What? Well. The one who's brave. One who can tell me if I'm wrong. One who's brave. (Smirks) I like big boobs. But there are lots of those, Jack. so I asked for a specific sign from above. What sign? Well, first of all. On our first meeting, she should be in a blue dress. And her first greeting to me must be you've got a nice mustache. What? But you don't have a mustache. I know, that's why it's a sign. I might have a mustache by then. That's so vague. Another thing, she has to like pineapple juice. But why? Because I have to be precised in asking signs from above. And the last one, she should be wearing red shoes. I don't think red shoes are a good match for blue dress. That's what good about signs. It has to be different. So, it's not just out of luck. Senorito. I also have a sign that I need to go home now. I'll go now. Okay, okay. Take care. Red shoes and blue dress, huh? What? I'll go ahead. Laryo! Laryo! Jillian. Beautiful Jillian! Yes, my- Ouch ouch! You're destroying my source of happiness! Hush. Be quiet! Someone might hear us. I need your help. I don't have money! Fool. Not with money! I need to be invited to Angelo's party. I mean, senorito. Hmm. I'm right, you're in love for the first time! He's handsome. And he has a big heart. Hmm. If I know. But, what about me? What about you? If I get adopted, what will I call you then? I can't call you sister. Not even brother-in-law. Let's think about it some other time. What about your vow? That you'll marry the man who can take responsibility in turning me into a man? Let's worry about that later! What's important is how will I look like! My clothes, my shoes. Okay. Leave that to me. You said you don't have money? Money? (Laughs) My darling sister who sometimes looks like a brother. You know. With us Bartolome, money is not necessary. We got credit card from Mama. (Smiles) I don't want to! I'm really scared. Let's just go home. But why? Why are you scared? What if all we had practiced might fall apart? Relax. I got you! I'll be beside you. Let's go. Just relax. Slowly. They are also interested in music. Yes, theater. In the Cultural Center. Opera. But have you watched it in Las Cala in Milan? Yes. Las Cala de Milan. Mom? Dad? She's my good friend, Jackylou. Good evening. How are you? You're so beautiful. Have a seat. Thank you. She's Mrs. Roa, Angelo's godmother. She's my mom. Primadonna. And she has a good voice. Let me sing for you. I'll sing for all of you. Oh, excuse me. I just need to make a quick phone call. Enjoy yourselves. Beautiful! I'm getting old. Yes, you are. That's why you need to think of getting married. I am thinking about it. Me, too. So, How is Boy? Nothing. He's already in jail. Shall I have hopes? What? On your thoughts about marriage. So. Do you like pineapple juice? Yuck! I hate it! How are you? Hey folks. Hey, Angelo! Thanks for coming! Happy birthday! Get anything you want. Have fun! Bye. Enjoy the party. Happy birthday, Angelo. Thank you, Gina. Thank you. Magnifico! Hilario! He's here! He's here! He's here! Just relax. How can I praise his mustache if he doesn't have any? Oh gosh, he doesn't have any. Relax. This won't do without the mustache. Just relax. Leave it to me. Jillian, please introduce me to your friend. Later, just have a drink first. And since it's your birthday, give this to me, please? Happy birthday to you. Okay. Your mustache looks nice. (Grins) I'm Angelo Bartolome. I'm the celebrant. Happy birthday. Thank you. Your blue dress looks nice. Thank you. This is my favorite color. Really? Yes. I'm Jack- Jackylou. Nice to meet you. Angelo! You left me. Sorry. I didn't notice you. Do you like pineapple juice? I was actually going to ask you. Do you have it? Because it's my favorite. Really? Yes. This is it. Why don't we go get some? Okay. Afterwards, the lady said, No Joe! You watch, I wanna buy! (Laughs) You didn't understand the joke? What? I'm sorry. It's not that. I'm just looking at your feet. Shoes. That's my favorite. This is it really. Thank you because she's beautiful, too. What did you say? Jackylou, would you mind if I drive you home later? No need to. I have my own car. I insist. I just want to know where you live. No, thank you. Do you want more juice? Angelo! You're just there, my son. The other visitors are looking for you. You should entertain them. We're having a great time here. I need to go now. Are you coming with me? I still have visitors. Angelo, go with her. Okay, I will leave you here. Jackylou, I'll introduce you to my friends. Angelo. You brought me here and then, what? Are you taking me home or not? You can take a cab. Just take it. (Sighs) Boy! Boy! Boy! How did you get in here? What are you doing here? Aren't you- I got out of jail. I need your help. I need money. Money? I don't have money. But, I know someone who has. If you want. I need something fast. Where? You're still very courageous, Boy. Sweetheart, go straight to the point. I need money, I'll go out of the country. I have a suitor. He's rich. Let's abduct him. His parents have many cash. Is your group still in-tact? (Laughs) Not one person has left my gang. Boys. Why not? You're the only one who knows where she lives. I don't want to tell you. Come on! Jack. If only you were here last night, you could have meet her. What? The lady. All the signs were present. And because of that, I couldn't sleep last night. Imagine, we talked the whole night. Then all of a sudden, she was gone like- Like a bubble. And he's the only one who knows where she lives. Let's go! Okay. Hey. Boss! We can't. Why can't we? Maybe Jackylou doesn't want to. How did you know her name? Oh, I mentioned it earlier. Yes, she mentioned earlier. How did you know that she might not want to? She also mentioned earlier. I didn't say that. She didn't- Let's go! Let's go! Even if we go around the country, I will find her. I know she's the one! We only met last night but it felt like I've known her. Okay, get inside. Go. Okay Jack, get inside. I'll drive, get in! Jack, let's go! Come on, Jillian. Tell me. I will make the process of your adoption papers faster. Really? Yes. But I can't. Why? Angelo. If you really want to know the truth. What truth? It would be better if- Hey! We'll get into an accident! What's that? What is this? Excuse me. What's the meaning of this? You're being abducted. Abduction! Get off the car! Get down! (Cries) Bring them! Hurry! Get in. I said get in! Give me pen and paper. Angelo. Get straight to the point. You will write what will I dictate. I know you need money. If it's just that, it's not a problem. Why? Do you have cash with you? Five hundred thousand pesos? Five hundred? Are you kidding? I'm sure you don't have it, but your father does. They can pay that ransom for you. We are not that rich. Yes, it's true. That's a huge amount, Tusok. Fifty thousand might be possible with Dona Star. Fifty thousand? We'll need our machine for that. Ouch! Be quiet. You're so full of foolishness. I have a feeling, Tusok. That you're not the only one behind this. You're right. You are not mistaken, sweetheart. Bella. This is also your fault. If you just agreed to marry me, I should not have done this to you. You think Angelo will marry you? I mean, senorito? It must be worse than suicide. You asshole! You're just a driver but you're so intrusive! Boy, I think we can use him. How? Let's cut the penis of this fool. And then, let's send it to Angelo's parents. That way, they'll be alarmed that this is not a joke. You won't be able to cut a- They are very stubborn. Go! Get them down. Oh! Angelo! Let me go! Let me go! I said let go of- Hey! What the! Jack is pitiful. I know. This is sad. Just when I finally met the woman for me. It's also Jack. What? Your driver Jack is my sibling! She is Jackylou! Are you kidding me? No. I am Hilario! Look at me. See? Oh no, they'll kill my older sister. We need to get out of here! Jack? Now I know why my heart was beating so- Save the drama for later. Untie me now! Faster! Faster! Let me help you! Go, go ahead! Ask for help! I'm nervous. Fool! Be a man! Your sister and I will die here if you keep acting like that! Go! Leave! Man? I think you should get the other two there. So they'll see how will I cut this one's penis. Okay. Man? You don't need that! Throw it! Where's the girl? Maybe he's there. He's there! Over there! He escaped! This way! This way. Go! Tusok! How does it feel to be- Hey! The girl escaped! What? He got away, boss! How did your friend get away? How? Bring him downstairs. I'll cut his penis as well. Don't try to escape! Come! Remove her pants! Okay, enough! Enough! Okay, Tusok. I will do what you want. I will write a note to my mom. I'll assure you you'll get the money before it gets dark. Finally, you said it. Hey, pen and paper. Untie him. Don't worry, Mr. Ambo. They will appear soon. Yes, tita. Don't you worry. It's not good for your condition. Shut up! Appear? But my child is still not here! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! My child! Why? Daddy, help me! Please help my sister! And Angelo, they will kill Angelo! Jill! Hilario! Hilario! You mean you are a man now? I will explain you later. We need to- Where's Baldo? We need Baldo! We need a real man's help! What's happening here- Jillian! Beautiful Jillian! You're now home, my friend! Welcome home! Baldo! Baldo who? Hey, mama! My beauty is called Betty now. Why what happened? He joined the federation! It's because of you. There's a saying. If you can't beat them, join them! This is ridiculous! I was counting on you! Why? My sister's life is in danger! What? Freaky. Joanna, Come with me, let's go to your mom. We need the help of your drivers! What are we waiting for? Let's go. Come on. Are you still not done? You've wasted so many papers! Stupid! That's it. It's done? This is done. What does it say? It's okay. Boy. Take this letter. You know what to do okay? Tie him up. Angelo, remember this. If your letter didn't work, your happy days are over. Go, tie him up! Take care of this. Dude, we will be rich later. Go dad, call the police. How about you? We will take care of this. Let's go. There. Let's get them! Tusok! Tusok! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Enough! That hurts! Enough already! Wait. Ouch! Ouch! I'm sure Tusok will be waiting for these two. Pedro, put them in the jeep. Tie them! Good thing. It's almost dark. Let's go. This is an evidence. Hey, sister! Wait for me. Would your mom and dad send money? I don't know, Jackylou. Senorito, it's Jack. I already know everything. Hilario told me. Can you forgive me for what I did, senorito? Is it my fault if you taught me how to love? It's just unfortunate. I realized things in this experience. Hey! You two! Why hasn't my messenger come back? Tusok, it's not easy to raise half a million. Let's wait some more. It will be here. Hurry! You're crazy! Hide it fast! Hurry! Hurry! That's a gunshot! Take a look! Boy! Jackylou! Hilario! Sister! Jackylou! Don't move or you'll die! Put your gun down! Put it down! Is it over? I got scared. Hurry up! Hands up! Policemen, here they are! Here. Dad! It's good! Hey, what's that? Come with us! That's my sister!
