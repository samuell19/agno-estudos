Of course not. - This can't be happening. Is it outside? What a disaster! - Take a good look. - Where did it go? LG TWINS DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS Hello. I'm the owner of this cell phone. Hello. Thank you so much. I was so tired last night, I didn't realize I'd lost my phone. - Sorry I couldn't call you earlier. - That's okay. May I ask where you are? I can come to you. - I'm in Seogyo-dong. - Seogyo-dong? If it's not too much trouble, could you come to Cafe Mizi? Okay. I'll see you in an hour. Thank you. INCORRECT PIN PLEASE TRY AGAIN IN 30 SECONDS No fingerprints and no belongings? This bastard thought everything through carefully. Jeez. Isn't it like a cry for help? I guess all that rain last week was so we'd find the body quickly. The heavens helped us. The rain also washed all the evidence away. - And a wild boar found it. - For crying out loud. Heads up. - Did you find anything? - Not really. This is all we found. - What's that? - Plant food. Plant food? But I'm not sure if it's connected. It could've already been buried there. WOO JUN-YEONG A vial just like this was buried with the victim? Jun-yeong's the killer. It's his tree. - It has to be a coincidence. - Come on. This vial proves he was there within the last month. This solid evidence matches the time of death. That idiot killed someone? How is that possible? That's what I'm saying. He's too fainthearted to kill anyone. So, what are you on about? He left home seven years ago but hasn't changed his address yet. He must hang out with bad apples. So, you're saying Jun-yeong didn't do it, but one of his buddies did? Exactly. Then we should ask Jun-yeong who he went there with. Call him. Got his number? Jeez. You haven't talked to him for seven years. How will you find him? Get a warrant? Put him on the wanted list for accessory to murder? Why bother? We have the Missing Persons Unit. If you want to find him, get a warrant. Yes, I want to officially report my son, Woo Jun-yeong, missing. Dad, I came in early to help you. You're welcome. Yeah, right! Did you find your phone?

Thank you. - Enjoy. - Oh, thank you. Just a sec. Is it officially back on the menu? No, I'm not sure. It's not that popular. Could you do me a favor? You know, I can't find plumade as good as this anywhere else. I'll talk to my boss about it. Yes. That would be great. We grow these plums. Oh, I see. That's the secret. Thank you. Enjoy. What took you so long? Do you know him? No. Why? Well, you seemed chummy. I thought he was a regular. A regular? You said no one wants plumade, but he did. Jeez, why would you sell it? It's not for sale. - I made it just for you. - Boss, I'm clocking out. What about dinner? I'm good. Why don't you ask your wife? She must be in touch with him.

They want to feature our products for next week's main event. Really? Should we do this or not? I can't decide. Of course we should! I thought something bad might have happened. This is all thanks to your hard work, Na-mi. Oh, please. Wow, this is really great. Congratulations, ma'am. I know it hasn't been easy. Thank you for your excellent work. Speaking of which, I think now is a good time to talk about pay raise. I'm all ears. Go ahead. I'll double it. Fifty million won? I should've done it earlier. Thank you for being patient. Why don't you go outside and make the announcement? Wait. This is just between us. Just me? You've worked with me the longest. You deserve it. Don't worry about them. If this project goes well, will you consider... This is why I like you, Na-mi. You're so loyal. You have my word. Thank you. Eat while it's warm, and take your medicine. By the way, what's with this chamnamul dish? It reminds me of Jun-yeong. He used to love chamnamul. Did he? How is he doing? - How should I know? - You're not talking to him? What's this all about? Why are you asking about Jun-yeong? I saw a plum tree at a crime scene yesterday. We planted a plum tree when Jun-yeong was ten years old. He didn't want anybody to know where. So we went deep into the mountain. A place you could bury a body and nobody could find it. I saw that plum tree yesterday. You can't possibly... Where's Jun-yeong now? - FIND OUT THE ADDRESS - THAT'S JUN-YEONG'S NUMBER? FOUND HIM Wow! For real? That's great. We should take a picture.

Jun-yeong got rid of his phone two years ago and never got a new one. Can you believe it? Who lives without a phone? HWAGOK-DONG I wondered what he was up to, so I checked the investigation reports. He filed a lawsuit for fraud in March 2019. Fraud? - Was he the victim? - Yes. He lost 25 million won in a double lease fraud scam. He has a phone repair shop, but no phone. Do you want me to find this place? No. Don't bother. Are you leaving? How will you find him? What are you going to do?

Do you want me to live in that house alone? Is this about yesterday? Don't worry. It won't happen again. How can I not when some weirdo is following you? What weirdo? See, you're oblivious. That dude at the coffee shop. He wasn't following me. I sold him a CD. Why did you take his business card? Why are you being so clingy today? Think about it. He lied about being a regular. The CD and the baseball tickets. Do you think that's a coincidence? If it's not, what is it? Don't you get it? He seems like a creep. Stay away from him. What are you saying? What did I do with him? I'm warning you before you do anything with him. Do you carry the knife I gave you? You're overprotective and obsessive. That's creepier. Okay? - Drive safe. - Hey, Lee Na-mi! I... That brat. What the hell? BATTERY POWER 15% Dad? Eun-joo? Who is it? God, you're scary. - Do you have a death wish? - I told you to install a latch. Is something wrong? Come out. Let's have a beer. Come on.

You didn't have to make things up. Was it serious with your mom? What did she say? Orange seats? How did you get these? From a regular at the coffee shop. Let's have some fun for a change. Wow, a business card. "Oh Jun-yeong." It's a dude. It's not what you think. Just in case there's a problem. Problem, my ass. Hey! Who is he? What does he look like? He looks neat. But I think he'd look better if he lost the glasses and got a haircut. - Sounds like you like him. - What? What are you talking about? Hey, be honest. Honestly? We have a lot in common, so I'm a bit curious. You already know you two have a lot in common? It just happened so naturally. I've only met him a couple of times, so it's a bit strange. Even Dad told me he gives off a weird vibe. He must have his reasons. "Digital Sheriff." Why does that sound so familiar? Isn't this where Yeo-jeong works? Wait, let me check my texts. It is. A digital security company. They're coworkers? I know. It's really weird. I can ask Yeo-jeong about him. Should I? Yes, go ahead. DAUGHTER SORRY ABOUT EARLIER CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

We need proof that you were hacked so we can file the case. While asleep, the pics from her phone were posted on her Instagram. - What more proof do you need? - But you don't have it now. You deleted them from your Instagram and left the chatroom. Are you sure you didn't post them yourself? You didn't get your accounts mixed up? I'm telling you that it wasn't me. So gather the evidence that shows you didn't do it and come back. We're... Thank you. Let's go. Hey, we can't just leave. We have to catch the perp. I know. That's why we have to go. Hey. EUN-JOO: NA-MI'S PHONE'S BEEN HACKED I NEED YOUR HELP REALLY? I'M ON VACATION I'M NOT IN KOREA MY PHONE HAS BEEN HACKED IGNORE MESSAGES JEONG BO-RA LEFT LEE DONG-GYOO LEFT DAD WE'RE TAKING THE DAY OFF You're taking the day off today. If you lay even one finger on her, I'll kill you. Please. You should've treated her better. Don't pretend that you're a good father. Actually, you're a fairly decent father. I know a father who hasn't reached out to his son since he ran away from home. It's because of jerks like him that I'm doing this now. Please don't hurt Na-mi. If she doesn't get suspicious of me like you did, she'll be fine for now. Don't do anything stupid. Do you know how long it took me to get this far after I found Na-mi's phone? It took three days. Three days. With this thing, I can find out everything I need. With this phone, I can find out what you bought, what you want, what you have, what you freaking ate, who you like, and who you dislike. As long as I have this, I can control anyone, and I can be anyone. And you're telling me not to do anything stupid? The security alarm has been deactivated. Isn't it strange? Hackers usually go for the money. - Why would anybody do this? - Beats me. - They're trying to screw you over. - Exactly. That means that someone I know did this. Did you ever tell anyone about the Kirke account besides me? Why would I? You're the only one who knows. I never told anyone about it either. You know what? I think your boss went too far. She can't do this to you. I know. But I understand. It was a secret between the two of us. Please. You don't have to be so understanding. We have to catch that perp and make things right. I can't give up now. Anyway, whoever it was, I'll end them when we find evidence. Who could it be? Do you know Yeo-jeong? She's a new recruit. How do you know her? - We went to middle school together. - Right. What a small world. I don't want you to get the wrong idea. We contacted Yeo-jeong first, but she was on vacation, so we contacted you. - Have another glass. - Thank you. Gosh. Did you find anything? I'm looking into a few things now. Did you notice your battery draining faster than usual? Yes. It drained very fast. As I suspected. Spyware was installed on your phone. What exactly is that? How can I explain this so you'll understand? This camera here works like eyes, and this mic works like ears. Look at the screen. This is exactly what the hacker can see. They can track your location, listen to your phone calls, and read your texts. You can easily get this spyware for a few dollars on foreign websites. It's a huge problem. But I haven't installed anything recently. How did it end up on my phone? I'm not sure. Can you find out who installed it? Can't you trace it? I don't think it'll be that easy. Why not? I mean, the spyware on my phone is proof. Can't we take it to the police and file a case? Even if the spyware is on your phone, the photos were uploaded using your phone. You have to prove that you didn't do it. That won't be easy. Wow, this dude thought everything through. So, what should we do? I can't just sit back and do nothing. I'll go back to the office and see what I can do. So, this is all we can do today? No. We're just getting started. I reset your phone so you can continue using it. Don't download any files or click on unknown links, okay? How much do I owe you for today? You can pay me all at once when everything's done. Thank you. - It's nothing. Don't get up. - Thank you. I'm sorry, but can you come outside and show me the way? - Ah, yes. - What? You can use a map application. Is there something else you want to say to her? Can you... What's with him? - What's wrong? - What? Where are you headed? Do you have a roommate? Me? I'm asking in order to find the perp. That's all. Do you have a roommate? No. What's this about? I'll be honest. It's about the spyware on your phone. There's no trace of it being downloaded. That can only mean that someone installed it directly onto your phone. And the sole purpose of this file is tracking location and listening in, so it can't be controlled remotely. I don't understand. I'm saying that someone grabbed your phone last night when you weren't looking. They posted on your Instagram, sent those texts, and turned off your alarm and ringtone. But you said you live alone. If I had to guess, someone snuck into your place, used your phone, and fled. What? Why do they look so chummy? Are you sure it can't be remotely controlled? Yes, I'm positive. Hey. Look at this. They found seven bodies in the mountains. Come on. Look! You've been like this for an hour. I've had a long day. I want to be alone now. I'll call you later. You can go now. Do you have something to tell me? - No. - What's with you? It shows. What is it? Be honest. Did something happen outside earlier? Did you do it? What? I know it's ridiculous, but the only person who had access to my phone that night was you. You heard what he said. There was spyware on your phone. - You think I installed it? - No, but everything points to you. Is that what he told you earlier? Do you believe him over me? I can't believe that jerk. Why is he pointing the finger at me? Call him again. Get him back here. If it wasn't you, just say so. Then I'll believe you. So, please say it wasn't you. You... You think I did it. How could you, of all people, suspect me? Just tell me it wasn't you. Why can't you say it? Yes. You're right. I did it. Yes, it was all me. Now what? Are you going to turn me in to the police? Go ahead. - Do it. Do you have proof? - How could you... Don't ever contact me again. Buried bodies keep turning up on a mountain in Pocheon, Gyeonggi-do. The police just revealed that they presume there are more bodies buried in addition to the seven that have already been found and will continue with the search and investigation. We wonder how many bodies... What a joke. Where the hell is your boss? - When did you last hear from him? - Sorry. Call Woo Ji-man and tell him to get here ASAP. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Do you think Jun-yeong did all this? He also killed Eun Mi-gyeong? Are you sure? Are you sure about this? Why didn't you tell me? You should've told me. If it was really Jun-yeong... You won't get away with this. They'll blame you for everything. Delete this footage. Let's say it was a mess when you got there, and you just found the victim's phone. It's all my fault that Jun-yeong ended up like this. Pointing fingers won't help! This is Jun-yeong's repair shop. Let's head over there. I don't believe you, so I'll have to see for myself. Let's go. HYEONGJE SHOPPING CENTER Good. This is good. - Do something else. - Something else? Wait. Am I doing it right? Very nice. BATTERY POWER 1% Only this many customers in two years? SMARTPHONE REPAIR He had those he picked out come here. Eight. Eight people? EUN MI-GYEONG There's one more. I know where he is. There's another victim? Lee Na-mi? Hurry. He must've left something. Left what? He left nothing by chance. There's no info on her here. Jun-yeong is stalling. Why don't we take this to the news? I know Jun-yeong could go into hiding, but we can save this person. I will catch Jun-yeong. Don't get in my way, and piss off. What if she dies? Then you'd be the one who killed her. Can you live with that? - 513, Hyeongje Shopping Center... - Hold on. We're police too. We're from Pocheon Station. Come on. We have something to investigate. Are you with the Gocheok precinct? Why did you come all the way here from Pocheon? This is a secret investigation. So, the person who picked up your phone left it here? And paid for the repairs? Yes. I think that's when I got the spyware. - Your name? - Lee Na-mi. From the looks of things, I guess it was that dude. BUSINESS LICENSE "Woo Jun-yeong"? He would have changed his last name to Oh Jun-yeong. What? Did you say "Oh Jun-yeong"? Wait. If the Oh Jun-yeong I know owns this place, the spyware could still be on this phone. I'll call his work. Let me use your phone. DIGITAL SHERIFF Oh, hello. I'm calling to ask a quick question. Do you have an employee named Oh Jun-yeong? No? Hold on. What about Joo Yeo-jeong? Such hard asses! - Okay. - You must be Lee Na-mi. What a crazy bastard. But don't worry... He installed spyware on my phone and completely destroyed my life. Then he pretended to help me. What's he going to do next? - Sorry? - He's not just a stalker, is he? What is he charged with? What's this secret investigation about? I know why you can't tell me. He films weird things and posts them on the web, right? - The truth is... - Yes, that's exactly it. That bastard. Where do you live? In the Sinchon area. - You live alone, right? - Yes. He asked me the same thing. He'll show up there, for sure. Let's go. What if he disappears? What if he never shows up again? Then you're lucky. Lucky? I don't think you understand what's going on. Do you know what I'm going through? People think that I'm a crazy bitch. I called my best friend a traitor, and the asshole I trusted... I can't trust anyone anymore. I feel like I'm being spied on 24/7. Do you expect me to wait until you catch him? What if you don't? Will you protect me forever? No, you won't. I need everything to go back to normal. - We have to catch him, whatever it takes. - We will, no matter what. - Just do as we say... - I'll invite him to my place. I'll make him come to my place. What? How? By using spyware on him. If I make him believe I don't know anything, he'll definitely show up. That's his objective. If my phone's off, he'll be suspicious. If he realizes I know, he won't show up. If we don't catch him, he'll do this to someone else. We have to catch him. I'll lure him to my place. That's a great idea. You think you can do it? Yes, I can. I WAS A BIT SHAKEN EARLIER ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT? I NEED YOU TO CHECK MY LAPTOP TOO CAN YOU COME OVER TO MY PLACE? YES, TEXT ME THE ADDRESS - I have a bad feeling about this. - Why? What's the problem? She has no idea who she's dealing with. That doesn't matter. - She should know... - What if he gets away? We just have to make sure we catch him. That way, she'll be safe. Just in case there's a problem. Who is he? What does he look like? He looks neat. But I think he'd look better if he lost the glasses and got a haircut. - Sounds like you like him. - What? What are you talking about? WHERE ARE YOU AT? I'M ALMOST THERE CALL ME WHEN YOU GET HERE What? That's Jun-yeong. It's him, right? OH JUN-YEONG Hello? Woo Jun-yeong. LEE NA-MI Turn around. Turn around. You bastard. Jun-yeong, don't move. Jun-yeong? I'm not him. Are you cops? Yes. We're following up on a call and thought you were a suspect. Regardless, you shouldn't point your guns at civilians. Were you startled? Sorry. But you don't seem that shocked to see a gun. Let me see your ID. Please leave a message... Can I see your ID before I show you mine? Why? You don't think we're cops? I want to know the names of the cops who threaten civilians with a gun. You know what? - You won't get away with it. - Hey! Stop. Come on. - You don't have to... - I'm an innocent civilian... We apologize once again. You can go now. Man, something about that guy seems a bit... He looks like him from behind. Let's get back to the car. Come on. Excuse me. My phone is in my room. We're safe. What happened? He had an emergency, so said he'd come over this weekend. And his phone's turned off. What's gotten into him? - Did you make a mistake? - Me? Maybe you guys did a bad job hiding. I saw you walking around earlier. The thing is, we saw a suspicious guy walk by. I'll trace the location of this number. We can catch him if he turns it back on. What if he knows what we're up to? Don't worry about that. This is the only place that bastard can go. Right. We can't stay here until the weekend. We can't even contact each other. What should we do? I have an old phone. I'll use that instead. It might frustrate him and make him show up earlier. That could work. Let's do that. Can't you talk to her nicely? CHIEF Hey. Why is your number in Eun Mi-gyeong's call logs? Why was a package your wife sent found at a victim's home? Did your son really do this? Did you flood the scene? - Tell me. - I was trying to catch him. Get back here. Where are you? - I will catch him. - You crazy... Major Crimes is this close to putting a BOLO out on you! I'll help you. Just come back right away! If Major Crimes catch us here, things will go to shit. Let's get back, clear the air, and then come back. No one knows about Lee Na-mi but you. Let's get back to the station, yeah? - Did you change your phone? - Yes, I did. Na-mi, I'm sorry to say this, but we have to get back to the station. I understand. He probably won't come back tonight. Will you be okay on your own? I'll be fine. It's not like the bastard's a murderer. Well, that's true. But still, a jerk like him can suddenly lose it. Is there somewhere safe you could go? Maybe a friend's? NA-MI'S DAD HAS ACCEPTED YOUR FOLLOW REQUEST NA-MI'S BECOMING A LOT LIKE YOU I MISS THE TIMES WE SHARED If he contacts you, don't meet him alone. Call us right away. Be careful. He could install that spyware again. Don't download anything. Either way, I'll keep in touch. If I don't text you, that means something's happened. Got it? I'll keep texting you. Text us. Dad, are you asleep? DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS NA-MI, WHERE ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOUR COWORKERS SAY? I'M ON MY WAY I'M REALLY SORRY OH JUN-YEONG: I SEE YOU GOT A DIFFERENT PHONE ME TOO CALL ME This bastard is getting bold. I FELT UNEASY WHY DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME? YOU WILL BE CONNECTED TO A REGULAR PHONE CALL CONFIRM Dad! Hey, Lee Na-mi. Dad! You've been on your phone all day. Do you want me to live in that house alone? Dad. Think about it. He lied about being a regular. The CD and the baseball tickets. Do you think that's a coincidence? If it's not, what is it? Don't you get it? He seems like a creep. Stay away from him. What are you saying? What did I do with him? I'm warning you before you do anything with him. Do you carry the knife I gave you? You're overprotective and obsessive. That's creepier. Okay? - Drive safe. - Hey, Lee Na-mi! I... CHOI WON-SEOK MISSING PERSONS TEAM We're headed back now. What do you mean? What? Where's my dad? Tell me. Now. Before I kill you. Do you want to find your dad, or do you want to kill me? Where's my dad? - Tell me! - Here. They found Jun-yeong. They found him, but... But what? Why can't you say? Where's Woo Jun-yeong? Jeez, I wanted to lie low for the time being. You ruined my plans. How will you make up for this? I'll do anything. Let my dad go. Really? In that case, send a text to Detective Woo Ji-man, and then we'll talk. You told him you'd text him. Where is that bastard? To file a missing person's report, I registered your DNA. And the unclaimed body found in the reservoir a year ago is most likely a relative of yours. - Return to the station now... - Jun-yeong's dead? That's ridiculous. I'm going to bed now. I will be in touch tomorrow. Send. Why are you doing this to me? What did I do wrong? I found your phone. What? Do I need a special reason? You're doing this to me just for the hell of it? Why did you leave such a personal thing in a random place? What are you going to do now? That's completely up to the people you know. In the next 24 hours, if just one of these contacts gets in touch with you, I'll let you live. But, Na-mi, that hasn't happened thus far. We live in a world where we're connected by the touch of a finger. Ironically, it also means we can be disconnected just as easily. That's what will likely to happen to you. Okay, then. Choose. Kill me now, or run while you still can. You'll get yourself killed trying to save your dad. Then tell me where my dad is. You can tell me that much. Excuse me. I have to use the bathroom. Dad! Welcome. Let him go. Drop that first. Dad... Enough with the drama. Tie your legs together. Now turn around. On your knees with your hands behind you. Jeez. Stop! Please stop! You had your chances. This was your choice. Dad. Dad. I'm sorry. Dad. Don't worry. Just hang in there. How moving. You should've been a good daughter. I did what I was told. You should keep your word. Of course. I'll keep my word, no matter what. You know what, Na-mi? No one contacted your dad. I'll keep my word. Dad, no! No! Oh my God! You son of a bitch! I'll kill you! I'll kill you, you son of a bitch! I'm sorry. I apologize. I'll do anything you want. Please let him go. Please. Please let my dad go. Do you mean that? Anything. I'll do anything. Then you kill him. SET AS WALLPAPER NO TEXTS, ONLY CALLS! Drop it. Drop it, you piece of shit! What? He's that asshole. Who the hell are you? Where's Lee Na-mi? Father. What? This crazy bastard. I know Jun-yeong's not dead. Where's Jun-yeong? Dad. I'm Jun-yeong. It's me. I'm your son, Jun-yeong! You're the one who turned me into this! Please stop hitting me. It hurts so much. Dad. You fell for it. Jeez, that imbecile couldn't kill anyone. Where's Jun-yeong? 0. WOO JUN-YEONG FAMILY: WOO JI-MAN POCHEON POLICE STATION BLAMES HIM FOR HIS MOM'S ILLNESS...
