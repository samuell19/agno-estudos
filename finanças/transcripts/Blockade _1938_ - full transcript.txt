[ Flute plays ] Giddyup! Giddyup! Giddyup! Attagirl! Giddyup! Giddyup! Giddyup! Go on! Giddyup! Giddyup! Go on. Whoa. Hey, Luis, give me a hand. I would like to, Marco, but can't you see I'm busy? [ Sheep bleating ] [ Laughs ] You see? If I stop playing, they get mad. [ Luis plays his flute ] What is that stuff you're unloading, Marco? Chemical fertilizer. Chemical fertilizer? I tell you, Marco, you are going against nature. Sometimes nature needs a little help. Not here. There is no wine in the world like our own Castelmare. This year it'll be even better. Hmm, what more do you want? Did you ever think about this, Luis? Hmm, why should I think about dirt? Life comes from it. It gives us bread and wine. The secret of life is hidden in the ground. Man must learn that secret and use it wisely. He put waste to the richness of the soil. I'll show them. I'll make my farm the showplace of the province. Well, I'm just a shepherd. I let my sheep do my work for me. I tell you, Marco, you are a slave to your own land. Not for long. Wait until I get tractor I sent for. [ Laughs ] When you'll get a tractor, I will get a saxophone. [ Luis plays his flute ] [ Dramatic music plays ] [ Bellowing ] Don't worry. Don't worry, children. There's no need to excite yourself. Are you hurt? You! Are you hurt? Ah... I'm all right. But... them? They're all right. The saints are watching over you. Have some wine! -Oh, not now, thank you. -That's too bad. The finest wine in the world, even better Tarragona. No, no. I'm in a hurry. I must get to Castelmare. Castelmare? You seem to have missed the road. ♪ Will she tell me I'm the one? ♪ ♪ Will she promise me in fun? ♪ Will she? ♪ Then, I'll have to run to a jug of porto. ♪ ♪ Aye, aye Days are never long ♪ ♪ Aye, aye, if your arms are strong... ♪ ♪ Round a jug of porto. Giddyup! My father used to sing little songs like that. But you're a foreigner. I wonder, do you think we could go a little faster? Luis, think we can go a little faster? Children, could we go a little faster? [ Bellowing ] They say, "No, I'm sorry." Have you ever been to Castelmare before? No. I'm gonna join my father there. We travel all over the world in search of art treasures, antiques and paintings. A painter once stayed at my house. He used to get up at dawn and paint till sundown. In the evenings, he talked to me about books, and art, and poetry. I liked that. It was the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to me until now. Until now? I mean, you smashing into my oxen and then... There you are. Here I am. Hardly seems true somehow. No. I seem to have crashed into another world. [ Bell ringing ] You must be very happy with all this peace and beauty around you. I am happy. It's good to work in the fields. I should like to do that. With your hands? Your skin is too soft. Here, the women work in the sun till their hands are hard and cracked like old leather. Yes, but they have other things that I can never hope for. Why? You have everything -- money, you travel, you're beautiful. Thank you. I think your painter friend must've taught you how to pay compliments and make pretty speeches. I never say anything I don't mean. You are very beautiful. "She walks in beauty like..." You know that poem? Yes, but how do you know it? It was in a book the painter left behind. Can you finish it? If I can remember it. "She walks in beauty like the night "Of cloudless climes and starry skies "And all that's best of dark and bright Meet in her aspect and her eyes" Thank you. Must be wonderful to be able to put words together like that when you want to-- when you want to tell someone how lovely she is. How far is it to Castelmare? You can see it when we get to the top of that hill. When I was a boy, I used to climb up there and watch the ships in the Mediterranean. Then, it'll take us a long time to get there. Yes. Do you mind? No, I don't mind. Well... I never thought an accident could turn out to be such fun. I'll say good-bye here. Oh, won't you come in? I want you to meet my father. Oh, but I can't let you go after all you've done for me. I've traveled in the Rome Express and the Orient Express, but nothing can compare with the Oxen Express to Castelmare. I'll never forget it. I won't either. I've got to go back. I have work to do. Your work means a lot to you, doesn't it? It used to mean everything. But now? I'm not sure. I've never met anyone like you before. I-- I've never met anyone like you before. Please don't change. Promise me you'll stay the same. If you promise to never change that perfume. You like it? I get it in Paris. Paris? Rome, Berlin, London... All the places I'll never see, and you go again and again. And I'd like to stay here and work in the sun until my hands get tough as old leather. Why do you say that? Because... I really mean it. I'll take that. [ Chuckles ] I like my sheep better. Let's go home. I'm in a hurry. You're in a hurry, now? Why did you come the long road over the hill when you could come the short way? Come on, boys. Norma! Father! [ Laughs ] Did you think I was lost? A little worried about you. Look what I brought you from London. Thank you. Thank you, my dear. I think I know what it is. And what did you bring for me? Andre! Hello. Did you have a nice trip? What are you doing here? I came solely for the pleasure of seeing you. Father? We met in Cairo and flew over together to pick up a few antiques. I thought we weren't gonna do any more business with him after what happened in South America. This is different. We do things on a bigger scale in Europe. It's more dangerous. Too dangerous to let you interfere. Well, you can do what you like. But I'm sorry, I- I don't want to have anything to do with it. Norma! You must, Norma, for my sake. Shall we ever settle down and live like other people? This is the last time. He promised me that I'll be free. You think I like it any more than you do? Soon, we'll have our little house and a garden. And I promise you, I'll do nothing but digging, digging in the garden all the day. Oh, oh! My favorite shoes. Will you forgive me if I intrude on this family conference? But I think we should get started. Where are we going? We must be in town in the morning. We've arranged for a very important cargo to be delivered to the-- to the proper people. I wanted to stay here a few days. What's the attraction here? I like it. Really, really, she is... She is a wonderful girl. I've never seen such fine eyes in anyone. She remind me of Carmen, my... my baby sheep. Why keep talking about her? As far as I'm concerned, she's as far away as the moon. [ Laughs ] That's true. But if you had her, it will be like having a fine jug that wouldn't hold water. She'll make a great show on Sundays and feast days. But remember that in each week there are six working days. Anyway, what's it matter? Take a deep breath and smell the earth, Luis. I'd rather take a deep drink of wine. And the water, look how clear it is. And the moon caught in it. I've been living by this river all of my life, and it's always been like that. That's it. It's always like that, and you never think of it. This belongs to us, Luis. Nothing can take it from us. Peace, strength, quietness. Makes you feel as if you were part of the earth. [ Explosion ] Listen. Thunder. Why should there be thunder? There isn't a cloud in the sky. There's a little cloud with silver edges over on the horizon. Yeah. But does a little cloud make such big thunder? [ Explosion ] I don't understand. It sounds like guns. Well, who would be shooting guns this hour of the night? I wonder. [ Explosion ] Let's be getting home. [ Explosions ] [ Explosion ] [ Explosion ] [ Explosion ] [ Explosions ] [ Explosion ] Papers, please. Oh, foreigners, eh? Where are you going? To Granada. We want to get out of the danger zone. [ Explosion ] What are we to do now? Find the road through the mountains. We've got to go along with the others, Marco! No. We've always lived in this valley. They are too strong for us. They can't come here. This is my land! You tell them that. But this is not our fight, Marco. You're wrong, Luis. This is our fight. This earth, this valley, it belongs to us. It's worth fighting for. Stop! Turn back! You may escape with your lives, but you won't have anything to live for. You'll be living in a dead world. Living in a place that belongs to strangers. It's worse than being in prison. This valley, it's ours. It's part of us. We were born here, like our fathers and their fathers before them! You can't live away from here! If they take it away, they'll take everything! Turn back and fight! Fight for it! Fight them from our valley, and it'll be ours again. Ours! Ours! [ Explosion ] Some piazzamen! Shout it out again. [ Solemn music plays ] [ Solemn music plays ] [ Singing a march ] [ Singing a march ] [ Singing a march ] Fire! [ Gunshots ] And here at the river, the enemy advance was stopped. And they were driven back to their present position on the east ridge. The defense of the valley prevented the capture of Castelmare. One man deserves credit for organizing the defense. Your commission reached us this morning. You've been made a lieutenant, as a fitting reward for your bravery and example. Thank you, sir. Still, more will be expected of you. You all know we're in a desperate position. This province has been cut off from the rest of our territory. And if they take this city, the entire province will fall. We can hold them back, sir. Your brigade will march without you, lieutenant. You will stay right here in Monte Fiore. I have a special commission for you. Yes, sir. Don't be disappointed, my boy. War isn't only in the trenches. It's everywhere. We must fight our enemies wherever we may find them. They can't defeat us if we all do our duty. They're weakening the morale of our civilian population by bombing cities, blockading our food supply, threatening us with starvation. Spies and traitors are spreading false rumors, sending out information, betraying every move we make. Our greatest danger is from the enemies among our own people. We must find them and clean them out. We must find them and clean them out. How many sweethearts! Oh, yes. I can count about... About a hundred. A hundred? More or less, but never less. How do you manage it? I play music for them all day long, and they stand around and listen. They stand and listen? And if I stop playing for one little minute, they wander away. But my dog bring them back. Your what? Your dog? But I love them best when they stand around eating grass. Your girls eat grass? No, not my girls. My sheep! Wait out here. ♪♪ [ Applause ] ♪ Beloved, I love you ♪ The stars are bright in this perfect night ♪ ♪ Come back to my arms ♪ Beloved, I love you ♪ Your hair and me ♪ Be near to me, beloved [ Sneezes ] [ Laughing ] [ Applause ] Oh, bravo! Here's to our country. Believe me, it's a great thing to fight against such odds, without enough cannons and ammunition. Who says that? Foreign newspapers. We have plenty of guns. Yes, but old-fashioned, of small caliber. Oh, no. Very modern and big ones, too. I don't believe it. Confidentially, we have hundreds of them. Don't believe everything you read in the newspaper. Just ask me. I know everything. I have a friend who's an officer. Hello, Marco! Where have you been? I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, no. Tomorrow, I'll be at the front. You leave for the front? That's special information, special for him. What do you mean? He asked me about military affairs. What did you tell him? Everything. Everything? Everything upside down. Who is he? I don't know. The more you watch, the less you see. [ Laughing ] The ace of hearts. You see it... And now you don't. It's up your sleeve. Pardon me, señor. The ace of hearts. Now you see it. You place it in your glass, sir. It's, uh, there. You see? [ Laughs ] That's funny. Oh, he's very funny. All the time, he's doing card tricks. No. The other. Look at his shoes. Hmm, I wish I had such fine shoes. That's it. Why would a shabby old man have shoes like that? It's in your hat. Oh. You look very innocent, señor, but I'm not so sure, huh? Ah! [ Laughs ] You had it all the time, eh? This is going too far. [ Laughs ] Hey. Arrest the magician standing at the bar. Arrest the magician standing at the bar. Arrest the magician standing at the bar. Arrest the magician standing at the bar. [ Knocks on door ] Who is it? Patrol officer! [ Knocks on door ] Open the door or I'll break it in! I'm coming! [ Yawns ] I'm coming. [ Sighs ] I was asleep. I'm so tired. I can't keep my eyes open. I'm afraid we'll have to keep you awake all night. You're coming to headquarters. Oh. Maybe you'll first explain... I'll explain nothing. Uh, you were ordered to bring me without my shoes? You may put on your shoes. Thank you. [ Music plays ] While you are waiting... I picked it up in a little shop in Castelmare. I collect such things. You know, uh, antiques. It's my business. Hurry up. I'm very difficult to fit. I have my shoes made-to-order in London. I always go to the same bootmaker, a little shop near Piccadilly Circus. They make excellent shoes. That's why I followed you. Your shoes are much too good for the clothes you wear. One makes little mistakes. [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshots continue ] [ Clock stops ] [ Clock stops ] [ Clock stops ] [ Clock stops ] [ Clock stops ] [ Hums ] Father, what...? Father! Father! [ Sobbing ] What's going on in here? The landlord said... It's all right, sergeant. Sir. You did it. You killed him! You! You must come with me to headquarters. You're under arrest. I'm sorry. I didn't know he was your father. I'll try to help you. You'll be treated fairly. You'll be given a chance. Same chance you gave him. What you say might be true, but in these times, we must be certain. Bring her in. Where are they taking those? Put them in the cellar. They're safer there. [ Flute plays ] Give me a hand. I would like to, but can't you see I'm busy? You! My sheep! Marco, they've taken my sheep away. Come with me. Where are you taking me? Military court is in session. Well, what do they want of me? What should I say? Tell the truth. Air raid! Lights out. [ Sirens wailing ] No, no, this way! Idiot, you want them to know this is our headquarters? Turn off the light. [ Airplane propeller whirring ] [ Airplane propeller whirring ] [ Screaming ] [ Explosions ] [ Screaming ] You stay here. You stay here. [ Screaming ] [ Crying ] Where are you? I'm here. Where? I can't-- Can you reach my flashlight? Are you hurt? I'm all right. Will we ever get out of here? Will we ever get out of here? I always wondered what the end would be. It comes to all of us. I don't think I'd mind. But I want it to be quick. I don't wanna wait and wait, buried alive, slowly to stifle to death! Never to see the sun again. Sun? Remember the road to Castelmare? You said you wanted to work in the sun. Work until your hands were tough as old leather. It seems so long ago. The night before the war started. I knew I'd find you again. You've never been out of my thoughts. I don't even know your name but your perfume. I can't forget what you've done. A little while ago, you killed my... Don't. There's so little time for hate. [ Coughs ] It's smoke. Dust? I'm not sure. Suppose there's a fire? Over here. It's blowing the other way. We're left here to die. [ Coughs ] [ Coughs ] No. No, we can't give up. It's wrong to give up. I won't. I won't. I won't. This may show them where we are. Get back. Over there. We must come down here. Help me, Beppo. It might be my friend. What's happening? What was that explosion? There's someone down there still living. Help us! Oh, not me. I have my own job. Better keep a sharp lookout for suspicious characters around headquarters. You help us now, I'll find you plenty suspicious characters. Digging? Digging! Breaking stones, do you hear? They'll never get here in time. -We'll die. -No, no, listen. They're nearer, much nearer. They'll get us out. And I'll be your prisoner. A military court... If you can prove you're innocent... Suppose I can't? Will they put me in a dungeon or stand me against the wall? I'll help you. You might have helped me once. But now... Why did you change? You're the one that's different. Times like this can't change me. I was born in the Russian Revolution. My mother was killed with me in her arms in front of my father's eyes. He took me to Budapest. There were guns in the streets, men marching. We escaped at night. China, South America, back to Shanghai. You think you're fighting for your country, but I know better, because I never had a country. My father followed any flag for the danger of it. I never knew how old and gray he was until I saw him die. He wanted a house and garden. But that's finished. You finished it... with one little bullet. Your father and I wanted the same thing. And you killed him. You're just another man with a gun and you got to use it. You got to kill. There was no other way. You didn't have to fight. Look here. Does that picture make you laugh? No. If I shot it and cut it to pieces, would you laugh then? No. It's too beautiful. So is my country beautiful. And I wanna keep it. That's why I fight. [ Rocks rolling ] Marco, is that you or your ghost? Luis! -Luis! -Oh, Marco! Oh, no. That's no ghost. Is that the sky up there? Yes. You come out here and get a good look at it. It's a grand morning. Help me get her into the air. Help me get her into the air. Help me get her into the air. Help me get her into the air. Where is she? She's gone. We've got to find her. The sentry would know. [ Baby crying ] What's that? [ Baby crying ] [ Baby crying ] [ Baby crying ] [ Baby crying ] A baby! Yes, we have a baby. Baby! Baby! Oh, it's so nice. Hi, baby. Coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie, cooch! Coochie, chochie, coochie, coo, coo... Nice baby, huh? No, no, no, this is my baby. Your baby? No, it's mine, too. All of us. Coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie, coo. It's a nice baby, huh? Marco. What about the girl? I think they've got her at headquarters. To me, the greatest offensive weapon in modern warfare is starvation. If the enemy blockade remains effective, it's only a question of time until we'll be forced to surrender. What is it? Excuse me, gentlemen. When and where was she arrested? One of our patrols picked her up in headquarters. What are you doing there? I don't really know. Come, now, you'll have to do better than that. I was too stunned by what had happened. My father had just been killed. How was he killed? He-- In the air raid. After that nothing mattered. I had nowhere to go. Your father's business? Art dealer. Then, he must have had certain connections among dealers here. No, he only dealt with private people. What are your plans? I have no plan. -Who are your friends? -I have no friends. Get me her record. I want to see it. Yes, sir. You were wrong about one thing, señorita. A friend has been inquiring about you. Mssr. Gallinet. Norma. Andre. You here? I arrived last night. But... You've had a terrible experience, my dear, but now you have nothing to worry about. I've arranged everything with the commissioner. Oh, Señor Vallejo here. I'm taking a serious step in releasing you on my own responsibility. And I'm doing it because Mssr. Gallinet vouches for you, and he's rendered some unusual services to us. I would suggest you leave the country as soon as possible, as I can't guarantee your safety on the present conditions. Thank you. Perhaps, you'll tell your friends abroad that we're not such barbarians as they've heard. [ Laughs ] Why do they take such dreadful passport pictures? [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] Of course, he is stupid. I've observed that great men are often stupid. Uh, when you see them intimately. Sugar? How did you become so friendly with Vallejo? Ooh, I've given him some rather useful information. Cream? So you serve both sides, hmm? Well... Oh, it's a game. It's the only way to play it. You'll never know which side will win. Personally, I enjoy it. It's exciting and amusing. Biscuit? I don't know which appeals to me more, the money or the adventure. And my father had to die! Oh, oh, I'm sorry. It's all my fault. And I was trying to make you forget it. Now, don't you see, Norma, what you need just now is exactly what I'm offering you. What are you offering? Adventure, money, love. Love? Uh-huh. I've decided what I need is the love of a really good woman. Let's be honest, we don't trust each other, Andre. You know I have no money to get out of the country. You've only helped me because you think I can be useful to you. That's putting it rather brutally, isn't it? It's more brutal than that. One word from you to Señor Vallejo, and I can be arrested again and shot. Mm-hmm. But I still don't wanna have anything to do with you. I'm sorry you feel like that, but I have important work for you in the next few weeks. I don't want to be mixed up in it. Now, what do you gain by refusing? If you don't go, I'll send someone else. The result will be the same except for you. You've no chance without me. I'll get out of the country somehow. The brutal truth is that you can't get away unless you do as I tell you. But I tell you, I don't want that. But if you follow my orders, I'll see that you get out of the country safely and that you'll be free. What do you want me to do? [ Key turns ] -Did you ring, sir? -I did not. Now, there isn't much time. Go to Castelmare and get in contact with friends of mine there. When am I to be free? When the province falls. The province? Yes. It's cut off on all sides. It can't possibly hold out beyond the end of the week. You seem very sure of that. Hm, well, that's what I'm paid for. Now, the key to the province is Castelmare. It's the only port through which they can bring in food and supplies. So far, we've kept it bottled up. But they'll make desperate efforts to break the blockade. You'll be in Castelmare to see they don't succeed. But that means that I'm... You've made your bargain. But remember, agents of mine are everywhere. If you try to betray me, you'll be shot. Now, listen carefully, you go to the café on the waterfront of Castelmare. Say that you feel ill and ask for a glass of water. Now, this is the one that contains the message. It's marked. Don't give it unless whoever serves you spills the water and goes back for more. Spills the water and goes back for more. And now if you get into any trouble, just swallow it. They're perfectly harmless. The secret of these is much harder to discover than the cards your father used.

Well, I didn't mean that personally because, of course, I can see immediately that you're different. Different from what? Oh, different from-- well, different from other people who are different or... or something. You're going to Castelmare, huh? Well, of course, that's self-evident because the train is going to Castelmare, and you're on the train, so, you know... You don't wanna talk, do you? Hmm, that's self-evident, too. But then, you see, we are here under very unusual circumstances. War. Now, I kept something here that... [ Train whistle ] I feel that I can trust you. Why should you trust me? I have my instinct.

No, it never occurred to me. You know, you don't lie very well. I haven't had as much practice as you've had. If you had had any experience, you wouldn't have followed me. Why?

NEWSMAN: But every time a relief ship tries to get through the other side, it seems to know all about it. They can't get past their blockade. You know, some of my newspaper friends seem to think that the information is coming from someone in this neighborhood. I can hardly believe that, but I suppose it's just another case of war psychology. It's the message? Yes. Yes. Yes. "Supply ship Fortuna arrives before dawn Tuesday.

And a special reminder to the coast that all catches of fish must be reported. They will be commandeered for the use of the army. Milk is reserved for the children and invalids, a pint a day, on presentation of a doctor's certificate. Fellow citizens, we must bear these hardships with courage... Let's get away. ...and have confidence that food and medical supplies will reach us. Then our fight will not be in vain. Oh, don't worry, they're probably following me. You know, all the newspaper men are watching me. Well, I can remember a couple of years ago... -Let's go this way. -Hmm? Yeah. Wanna have a cigarette? What are these women waiting for? Hmm? Oh, food. They won't believe there isn't any. [ Crying ] What is it? Can I help you? Well, they're trying to bring a relief ship through. We can only pray for it. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ How is the baby? The doctor said he couldn't do anything for her. You must have faith. We must pray all night. We must pray all night. Why don't you go home? It's getting late. Why don't you go? What's the matter with her? Why does she just sit there? In the last air raid, a bomb destroyed the school house. Her children are buried under there. Ever since, she just sits there. Nothing could be done about it. There's a little place in England on the Thames that I know. You ought to see it on a drowsy summer afternoon. The smell of the gardens, people in the fields, and I can see all this happening there, hunger and machine guns. The bomb dropping on a school house, hundreds of little lives wiped out. I can't stand it anymore! Oh, I'm sorry. [ Baby crying ] What is it, doctor? What is it with all our children? Is it in any danger? That depends, if the ship gets in in time. [ Baby crying ] Luis, I have a plan. Before you make any plans, you better arrest that girl. Lieutenant Marco! If anything goes wrong, you'll be blamed. They'll say you did it on account of a woman. You know better than that. Yes, I know, but the general and the colonel... He checks by results. What's the good of locking her up if we can't get the people she's working with? Everything depends on the next two hours. I'll do my part and you do yours. Go get your men. Don't forget to take care of the baby. I must speak to you. Why did you come here? I'll be killed for telling you this, but now I don't care. You were right. I am a spy. I brought a message for someone. You delivered it? It will be transmitted to the submarine base tonight. They'll destroy the ship. But I can save it if you'll give me a chance. Don't let your men follow me when I leave here. I'm only asking for a few hours. To let you get away. Do you think I'm lying? What made you change? I've seen the eyes of the women and the children. Eyes that stared, stared from starving little faces, trusting eyes, they wouldn't believe there was no more food. There was a woman, her baby was dead. She refused to believe it. She rocked him in her arms. And there was one with crazy eyes just staring, waiting for her babies, who were buried there. I tell you, I can't bear it. As long as I live, those eyes will haunt me, because I betrayed them to save my own miserable life. I hadn't the courage to give it all up because I was afraid to die. But now I don't care. I don't want to go on living with this, this horror, this agony in my heart. Help me. They're out there praying, praying for that ship to come in. But I know that it never will unless... unless you will do what I'm begging you to do. You're free to go. You think you can trust your men? You can depend upon them. They know every inch of the coast. You understand your plan? Absolutely. We're ready. Let's go. [ Chatter ] [ Chatter ] [ Chatter ] [ Chatter ] Where are you going? Bandarillo. Bandarillo. Password. Bandarillo. Bandarillo. Bandarillo. I have a new message for X4. You in contact? We've already sent final instructions. Instructions are changed. X4 must return to the base immediately. Why? Our plans were known. The food ship has been sent to another port. It's urgent. Are you in contact? Stand by for further orders. Tell them to go back to the base at once. [ Explosions ] [ Explosions ] [ Explosions ] [ Explosions ] They cut off. I'm sure it's a mistake. We'll proceed. We'll proceed. We'll proceed. Halt! Marco! So you betrayed us! You! [ Screams ] You too. Why couldn't you trust me? Why couldn't you believe me? I did believe you, I swear it. Then, why did you follow me? There was no other way. I had my duty to do. Duty! What about the ship? It's out there with food, everything these people want. And now there's no chance. I tried to prevent this thing from happening, but you wouldn't let me. Pray for it. Pray for it. Pray for it. Pray for it. The ship! The ship! The ship! The ship! It's sinking. It will be at the bottom of the sea in a few minutes. It's where all our food goes these days. The fishes feed well in times like these. There is no hope for us now. There is no hope for us now. There is no hope for us now. There is no hope for us now. There is no hope for us now. Now it's gone. Why did they do that? You must have been very naughty. Don't cry, my baby. I know where there's milk, love. Plenty of it. I'll take you there. You'll have everything you need, everything you've been wanting. It will be peaceful there, too. Everything we've been waiting for, my little one. I'll take you there. [ Splash ] The whole world ought to know about this. They will. The stuff that I send home will burn up the cables. To sink a ship trying to bring food into these poor devils, what human beings could send out information to help a thing like that? to help a thing like that? [ Car honking ] What's happening here? The relief ship was torpedoed at the harbor entrance, sir. What? And we came to welcome it. And we expected to find the whole town rejoicing. There should be an immediate investigation. The report shows that you arrested six men and a girl. A strong recommendation for mercy for the girl. Yes, sir. She's not responsible for this. If we could find the men who sent her... Yes, she might help us there. She might disclose their identity. Yes, sir. Send her in. You'll take care of the six men for me. Sir. Here's my order. See that it's carried out at once. Yes, sir. Good luck. So, you're in difficulties again. I'm sorry. This isn't gonna be a formal cross-examination. Between ourselves, I don't like formality. You have to talk to me as if I were your own father, and, after all, I'm old enough to be that. If I can help you... I... I don't want any help. I wanna make up for what I've done. What have you done? I'm a traitor. Not to my country, because I have no country. But I betrayed the people here. I used to think that wars were fought for slogans, for flags. But now I've seen and understand. I've been betraying myself and didn't know it. And who gave you your orders? Your friend, Gallinet. Agents all over the country have been taking orders from him. I can give you proof. I'm glad you told me that. Had you told anyone else, it might have had serious consequences. Come in, please. She was just about to betray you, Andre. I am disappointed in you, Norma. I thought you had more intelligence. You might have guessed that Señor Vallejo is working with me. Unfortunately, it can remain a little secret between the three of us, or rather the two of us, for she'll hardly be in a position to make any further confessions. [ Phone rings ] Yes? Oh, very good. All of them. Thank you. It might interest you to know, the men who were arrested with you have just been executed. Oh, splendid. Your own men? Well, they might talk. We make it a habit to save our friends from that temptation. No! No! No! Yes, and we'll do the same for you. Why? You think you can get away? Why, every soldier in this place is one of my men. Oh, you little fool. You've made an awful mistake. But there still may be a way out of it. At least, we can talk things over. What do you expect me to do? Beg for mercy? Why not? You know, I never could resist you. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Death before dishonor, huh? If you like. You must be tired of living. You're wrong. I want to live. Hmm. That's too bad. You know, you remind me of your late father. -My father? -Yes. Because he had illusions about living a different life, house in the country and all that sort of thing made him unreliable. I gave him a very dangerous assignment. It was time to get rid of him. You planned his death? Yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I don't hesitate when anyone gets in my way. Cigarette? The men arrested by me have been executed. My orders. But there was no examination or record! Are you cross-examining me, Lieutenant? No, sir. You failed to protect the food ship. I haven't failed yet, sir. The food ship is coming in. Are you crazy? I saw it go down. You were mistaken, sir. Look. What's that? The relief ship. The one that was sunk? An empty hull with no one on it. A ghost ship. My men towed it from the west harbor to deceive the enemy. Why wasn't I informed of this? The commandant was told, sir. The commandant? I see. Wait here, Lieutenant. Andre, we've been tricked. The submarine destroyed a decoy ship. The relief ship itself is coming in now. What are we going to do? It's too late for the submarine. We'll have to use planes. I'll take care of it. Well, let me know as soon as you get in touch... So, they sank the decoy, did they? Well, I'll see that ship never reaches the harbor. No. No. [ Gunshots ] I did it. I did, I had to. He was sending for planes to bomb the ship. Come on. I'll take you to the commandant. We're prisoners. What should we do? I don't know. -But don't be afraid. -I'm not afraid. But the ship, it mustn't be stopped. Why don't they signal? I don't like the looks of it. They were on that boat. They'll tell us. Cheer up. Cheer up, everybody. Soon we'll have food, plenty of it. Meat, bread, rice, and everything. I did it. Oh, well, the boys helped, too. You're under arrest. You know who you're talking to? You're all under arrest. Oh, you got the wrong people. We're the ones to get the medals. We had trouble enough with that piece of scrap iron. We had some job keeping her afloat until they sank her. Come along. Oh, first, I must see the commandant. Why did they arrest them? Who knows? Maybe it's not a relief ship. Wait. Ahoy! [ Singing ] [ Singing ] What's that? What's that? What's that? [ Crowd cheering ] [ Crowd cheering ] [ Crowd cheering ] [ Crowd cheering ] Call the people for help! They can't hear us. If they knew, they'd help us. We've done all we could. Must it end like this? No. It must go on. So much has happened since we met. I've never really been in love before. I never understood what death meant. It's all inside me. For the first time in my life, I can say things I feel as if I was part of something. I know, Marco. I understand so much I never knew before. I never thought about people, but now I want to live for them, work with them. Because we love each other. But it's too late, Marco! It's too late! No, it isn't. This minute is everything. It's the meaning and truth of our lives. We're going to die. There isn't anything else. There's everything. I know it's hard to die wanting so much to live for, but we're part of something, something greater than we are. Men and women, the faith in ourselves, all sorts of things I can't find the words for. Those people out there, we've given them hope again, you and I. Their ship is coming in. We gave it to them. It's worth it, Norma. You must believe me. I believe it, Marco. You're to come with me. You're to come with me. You're to come with me. [ Crowd cheering ] [ Crowd cheering ] [ Crowd cheering ] [ Crowd cheering ] [ Crowd cheering ] And so we feel you deserve our thanks. Well, I don't want your thanks, gentlemen. I've taken these extraordinary precautions to ensure the arrival of that cargo. Because I know what it means for the success of our armies and the morale of our civilian population. I've only done my duty as a patriotic citizen. I see that... Who ordered these people brought here? The commandant. There must be some mistake. There's been no mistake. You ordered these people here? I did. What does that mean? It means you've used your high office to betray a cause you're pretending to serve. There's no crime as rotten as yours, a cheap politician making a profit on the blood of his own people. Take him away. Your testimony will be needed at the court martial, both of you. You're free. Lieutenant, you've served your country well. And I'll arrange to have you go on leave as soon as possible. Maybe you can find a little happiness, peace. Peace? Where can you find it? Our country's been turned into a battlefield. There's no safety for old people and children. Women can't keep their family safe in their houses. They can't be safe in their own fields. Churches, schools, hospitals are targets. It's not war, war is between soldiers. It's murder, murder of innocent people. There's no sense to it. The world can stop it. Where's the conscience of the world?
