And, and if the cops get involved, then the people who own this are gonna come for us. We have to think. Right now, they don't know we found it. So we need to keep it that way. Why would they do this? We look innocent. And if shit hits the fan better us than them. I wanna get out here. Melanie, Melanie, Mel. We will, okay?

Here give these to security when you go. [door clicks] Hey, one more thing. The stern exit is a lot faster if you make it there before 10. Good luck.

Don't say anything. This interview is over. My name is Gregory Lund and I'll be representing you. I need to speak to my clients. Out. Sorry about that, ladies. Let's get right to it. The reality is we can't dispute the facts, but a guilty plea could decrease your sentence significantly and you'll get better terms. Minimum security, family visits.

[brooding music] For the first time in my life, I felt seen. You know? People wanted to know me, Dad. Thought I'd finally found myself. By the time I realized how fake everything was and what was really going on, I just. Mel, baby, it's okay. Look at me. I love you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [Dad crying] [ominous music] Good evening.
