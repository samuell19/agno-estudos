You have no idea what I'm lookin' at right now. That crazy drunk is outside Mini Mart throwin' beers against the wall. Who? - Oh man. Jimmy? - Yeah. He's gonna get himself busted again. I better stop him. No, you don't. You let him get in trouble. He is no good. Come on, Darlene. Let God and the police sort it out. He's where he belongs. - No, look, my Dad'd go crazy if I let him-- Mark, come home. I'm not going to waste my breath. Don't you get involved with this. Especially after what he pulled at band practice. - Look, I'll be there in a little bit. May play out but you are gonna sit there right in front and stare him down, that's all I know. - Yeah, we're not gonna do that. Yes we are, too. - Darlene. Just come home. - Yeah. - How 'bout you change outta those church clothes. - We're already dirty. - Well don't ruin em. Look, I won't. So answer me, Dad. Look, answer me! What are you gonna do about Jimmy? - It's his band, it's what he's been livin' for. Man, it's your band, too. - Yes it is. - So? Mark, Mark, pay attention! So what? - So he comes right out of prison, all of a sudden he's in charge again. He's not in charge. - Man he acts like it. Hey , get over there. Jesus, I don't even know why you put up with him. That's a mystery. - Look, it's not that funny. - Come on Mark, you're spookin' the horses. - I'm not laughin' at you, son. - I've been workin' my ass off writin' songs, and learnin' all this stuff and he doesn't give a shit about that. I shouldn't have put you in the band. - Yeah but you did. - I shouldn't have put you in the band without talking to Jimmy first. Man, he was in prison, he has no say. - Your aunt Kathy has asked you to keep it down. - I'm sick of him, Jimmy Poole is no good. - Hey! Jimmy's been in your life for 20 years. - Man, Jimmy Poole's no good. Open that gate. - Your boy's got a lot of fire. - It's good he got it from somewhere. You and I never had a strong point of view between us. - How's Jimmy? - He's still gettin' on his feet. God damn it. Ah, man. Woah. Shit. Shit! What are you laughin' at? You look sorta ridiculous in your bun-huggers and all. - Is that so? You better not. Do uh, do I look ridiculous now? Do I? Hey, give me my hat! Where you goin'? - Momma. Oh, can it. He was takin' me to a wedding. We don't know anybody. - We know Pastor Simple. He wants us to tell people about church. - Yeah, well nobody's gonna wanna talk to me if I look like a beggar. Mark, people still think Darly and I are sisters all the time. I'm thrilled. Meg. - Alright, you kids have a good night. Do something romantic, make babies. - Ugh, leave! - Bye, Mark. - You want to do somethin' romantic? - I dunno babe, just don't think it's that funny. You strippin' naked for a totally strange girl. It wasn't like that. I put my underwear on my head to scare her off. It was funny. - You did? Did she laugh? Well she was laughin' her ass off. - What if someone saw you, out in public and all that. - Look, God made us that way to begin with, and God don't make any mistakes. 'Least not with me anyways. - What if someone from church had walked by and seen you naked with your underwear on your head? Then they would have thought I was a crazy heathen just like the rest of my family. - Are you making fun of me? You better not be. Your family is not funny. How they brought you up with sin all around you. And then one of them, that Jimmy, off to prison, of course. Now he's back, who knows what he's capable of now. They can't redeem some of those people, Mark, it's true. Then they just let 'em out 'til they commit another crime and then they're back in prison doin' what all they do in there. I'm glad you're done with that. I'm glad you don't have to be in a band with them anymore. - You know that's my Dad you're talkin' about, Darlene? - I know that, Mark. I do know. Your poor Momma gettin' off the drugs after it was too late. - Too late for what? - I'm just sayin', it's also a good thing that you're not in that band anymore. Look, we got a Christian life, here. It's good, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. That's because we're livin' the Lord's way. When we have our babies we're gonna raise 'em right, too. They're not gonna be exposed to a contrary life or the drugs, or any of it like you had to. So what was her name? - Who? The woman you stripped naked for. Church baptizes people in that water. * When the fire in the heart burns yes * I've gained solitude * A quiet that lasts - I don't know it yet, just sing it straight. - Alright. * A quiet that lasts - For far too long * For far too long * And the... * And the tear bowls * And chairs I built so proudly * Stand empty * Bordered and arranged * For the perfect mix of company * Company - That's the wrong chord. - Your guitar's right in the other room. Yeah, I never picked up that guitar in my life. - And for that we are grateful. * That won't be, that won't be - Oh, wait. * They were never comin' * But I knew it * I knew it already * For a feelin' that I keep inside * It's deep inside, I'm sorry * That I want for better times * That ended up so unhappy * Ended up so wrong * I been missing you * I been missing you - Tyler Boone. Wonderin' where you get your ideas from. - You'd be surprised. That right? - We got a little problem. - What's that? - We sprung a leak. - Oh hell, we've clogged the sink. - What? - Ooh! What the hell. We got a leak a while back. Just forgot to fix it. Bucket does the trick most times, I just forgot to empty it. Alright, I'll fix it tomorrow, we got a mop? - Just use a bunch of towels. Take this. - Alright. - Take it to the bathroom, dump it in the toilet. You got to do this all the time? No, just once in a while. I've been distracted. I've been distracted. - Hey. Looky-looky. Who are those handsome boys? Maybe I owe you an apology. - I'm sorry, what was that? - Don't. - Oh, Hosanna. Hosanna. - Jimmy, shut up. Finally. Finally. I'm alive this day to see Tyler Boone apologizing to me. I need a witness! Anybody? Jimmy! Yep! Bring it on. Bring it on. Come on. - No, not now. - Come on Come on. - No. - Come on. Come on, come on. What? - I think maybe I shouldn't have had... I think maybe I shouldn't have had Mark front the group this past year. - Alright, well, it's all figured out. He took it like a champ. - I don't think he did take it too well. - He'll get over it. - He talked to me about it this morning. He thought that he'd still have a-- - He thought that he was gonna take my place in my band. That kid's got balls, I mean that's good. You gotta hand the kid his balls. He does, and - Yeah, see Tyler, he got a wake up call. I'm not going anywhere. I'm back. - Yeah. - He uh... he was a good placeholder. He kept the band's chops up. - He did a real nice job. - Yeah, good. What's your point, Ty? We couldn't just stop playing because you got yourself in trouble. - Well, you didn't stop. - No, 'cause Mark stepped in nicely. - What? 'Cause Mark stepped in nicely. - Well, that's what I said. You know, for a kid I'm sure he did a nice job. - He's not a kid. - What the hell is your point? - He's not a kid! - What's your point, Ty, you want me out of my own band? - I'm not saying that at all. - Well, that's a relief, 'cause fat chance. - Oh shut up, Jimmy. - Hell no. Fat chance! I front that band. I been waitin' three years for it. - He's not a kid. He's a grown man and he put a lot of himself into that band. - Into my band, Tyler. I grew that band for years and years. - We both did. - Yeah we both did. - We really didn't know when you were comin' back. - What the hell does that mean? I got sentenced to three years, I served three years. - I've been waitin' around forever. Who you been talking to? - I could have been waitin' forever and I won't do it. You understand me? - Alright. - Never again, Jimmy. - Alright. - I put Mark in the band, and he did a real nice job, and he doesn't deserve to be kicked aside. - Is that your point? - He's good. - That better be your point, Ty, 'cause I'm not gonna stand around here listen to this bullshit about how you're a widow because I'm a big loser? Y'know every visiting day this same snotty, jilted bullshit was drippin' off you like I had killed your dog or something. - Yeah? - Every time. - I messed up comin'. - That's right, you did. - You were gettin' meaner and meaner in there and I don't want any of it. Never again. - Are you drawin' a line in the sand, Ty? Are you givin' me an ultimatum? I raised that boy right along with you for 20 years. I was right there. And now I'm no good? No good! Tyler, you got it all figured out! I tell ya! Shut up! - Alright. Hey! * Get me out, get me out * Get me out from behind the wheel of a UP Service van * Runnin' around in polyester brown is more than I can stand * Maybe I could box * You gotta take me to your hidin' spot * Prove to me I'm not just a UP Service man, yeah. * Prove to me I'm not just a UP Service man * Alrighty, tonight's music is brought to you by our local celebrity back among the free. You got yourself into a little bit of trouble making a withdrawal from a temperamental ATM machine. Isn't that right, Jimmy? - Frickin' ATM! - Dance with me, celebrity. - Oh... I fear that I would step all over your feet. - Ah, well, I guess we better not, then. Yeah. So, Ty called in the cavalry. - That's me, sweet pea. He's just a little scared. Nothin' more than that. - Scared of me? - Well, it's just been a while. People can change a little bit. People change, Jimmy. - You've changed. You're lookin' a little older. You remind me of my momma. Yo Jimmy! Thank you, buddy. - Yeah, I'm drinkin'. That's the right answer. - Oh, let's do another one. - Hey there, Jimmy. Yeah. - John Doyle. Wanted you to meet my beautiful wife Lonna, here. - Alright. Hi, Lonna. - Hi Jimmy, I'm a big fan. - Oh, thank you. - Where's Ty? - Uh he's uh, he's at home tonight. - You know Lonna and I have watched a couple of your shows and we just love 'em, we think you're great. - Aw thanks, that's good to hear. We ain't dead yet. - Not by a long shot, cowboy. - Not by a long shot but your music is kinda different its not country. Is that Americana? - I don't know, it's uh, all the Bobby Darin and show tunes growin' up and Ty's really into Zydeco and bluegrass and we're all over the map. - Well that's alright, it's doin' well for ya'. Happy to hear it. Y'know Jimmy, I got a - Now let's keep it going with country karaoke with Mark! * Take a picture it'll last longer girl * Take another look * At this kook who's crazy for you * From the mornin' 'til the bed * I'll bet you'd get a warm and friendly feeling if you took * Just one more picture baby, take another look * I'm a hopin', and a prayin' that * I'm a curiosity, a sight you've never seen * And stoppin' you in your tracks * Before you're off to another wonder * And I'm a thing of the past * Take out your picture, take her and make it snap * What are you doin'? Oh, lord. - I'm sorry. - You're always sayin' "I'm sorry". - Seems like. Where'd you get that bottle? - You hid it around here years ago. Figured I'd need it eventually. You're wet. - Mark should be playin' with us and singin' sometimes. He's a good boy. - Just when I think I'm about over you. - This guy John Doyle who was at The Wrangler last night, he wants us Poole Boys to play main stage at the Barn Dance Music Festival. Mark should sing a couple of the tunes. - Oh now you're gonna make me cry. - No don't. I got somethin' for ya. It's a little uh, little friendship bracelet, hmm? It's a real pretty song, it's just you gotta... just gotta relax it a little is all. Mhmm. * Sole, precious soldier, won't you * Lead the way * There are not many of you nowadays * I was a soldier but I * Lost my way in fighting * Give me stay once more to hear you say * Lay it down * Lay it down * Lay it softly * Make a dream come true * Lay it down - Maybe just don't play, hm?

I love you, buddy. - I love you, too. Mmm! Oh boy - On there. Hey. - That is my song. Don't mess with my song, don't you ever. What the hell? Now look, I'm the only one that's gonna be singin' that song, okay. - Mark - Mark - It's shit! - Mark! - Mark! Mark, come here! Mark. Hey, come here! God dammit, Mark. Shut up, Jimmy! I got no reason to talk to you. - Mark! C'mere! * But now I rest * In holy water * Lay me down * Lay me down * Fight will go easy * Now that water washes me * Come to rest when water washes me * Come to rest * When water * Washes me * Water washes me Morning, everyone. - Morning. - Ooh. - That was the perkiest one yet. So we've heard a lot about John the Baptist. John the Baptist this, John the Baptist that. How he was a colorful dresser, how we was an aromatic fellow. We wouldn't want him sitting next to us this morning in church. No. - But Jesus, you see, chose John the Baptist, the baptizer as his spiritual facilitator. And when John the Baptist relaxed a little and anointed Jesus, well, all the heavenly fireworks did begin, didn't they? And he saw the spirit of God come down like a dove and a light on him and he heard the voice of heaven say, "This is my son whom I love. With him I am well pleased." So I suggest to you that our heavenly Father is both well pleased with his only son Jesus, and with the eccentric, colorful, fragrant John the Baptist. - My reading this morning will be from the Book of Luke. "The Word of God came to John, son of Zechariah "in the wilderness. "He went into all the region around the Jordan "proclaiming a baptism of repentance "for the forgiveness of sins "as it is written in the book of the words "of the prophet Isaiah. "The voice of one crying out in the wilderness. "Prepare the way of the Lord. "Make his path straight. "Every valley shall be filled "and every mountain and hill shall be made low. "And the crooked shall be made straight. "And the rough ways made smooth. "And all flesh shall see the salvation of God. "Amen." - Moses came to Pharaoh, and he said, "Please, Pharaoh, let my people be free." And Pharaoh said, "No." - No! - Moses came back the next day and he said, "Please, free my people!" And Pharaoh said, "No!" - No! - Hugh! But you see, Mark, the Lord forgives. Well you haven't done anything wrong, but we all have at some point in our lives. So your best defense is a good offense. To live a good life. Make your family. Give me some grandbabies, okay? I'm sure you and Darlene got that all figured out. But you're doin' what you can on that count, huh? Am I right, slugger? - Mhm. - Am I right? Hm? Mark, will you carry this box out to the truck, please? It's stuff Mom says we need for the kitchen. - Yeah. - Oh, right, right, it's just a few things you shouldn't have to be goin' without. Times is hard, we know. We started off with nothin', just like you. And I don't imagine there's too many people botherin' to buy those old cars you like to fix up. Have you thought about Medvelle Chevy, sales? Well sure ya have. Well God has a plan, that's right. Meg, leave him alone. - Well, he could work for them is all's I'm sayin'. If he got a job in sales he could make enough for a family. You know Buddy down there, right? - Who? - What's all this crap for? - Stuff people have in a regular home. You'll see, one day we'll need... one of these. What is this? - You ready to go? - I guess so, I have to get my purse. - Alright. - You don't want to stay and eat a little bit? No. - Well you go on then, I'll get Daddy to bring me home. That's awesome, baby. It was great, wasn't it? Beautiful, yeah. Yeah, okay, good. Oh! Got company. Hey there! Hey. This Hugh's place? Yeah, they're inside. Eh, I'm John Doyle? This's my beautiful wife Lana over here. - Hi, pleasure. - Hi, sweetheart. - How are ya. - You're Mark, that's Jimmy's boy, right? - Yeah. - I think we saw you doing karaoke last night. You a professional entertainer? - Well I used to play in a band around here, yeah. - Y'know, I got a group in Missouri. They could really use your help. - Missouri? - That's Branson, Missouri, you've heard of that, right? - Yeah man, that's an amusement park, right? - No-- Dolly Parton and all that? - No, no, no, you're thinkin' of Dollywood, that's in Tennessee. - Yeah look man, I don't want to work in an amusement park or dinner show or anything like that. I'm gonna front my own country band. - Well, I can understand that. Good luck to ya. I hope you make it. - Yeah well, I been doin' a lot of singin' and songwritin'. - Ya goin' in the house? - I'm leavin'. - Oh, well, have Jimmy get a hold of me, he knows how to find me. - Can I g... Thank you. * Boom g-g-g-g-g-gun * Burnin', burnin' rubber * And some women in high heeled shoes * Give me old valley boys with * Give me * Up all night * Stirrin', stirrin' * Makin' my big scene Hey, Mark! You singin' tonight? - No, man, why aren't you playin'? - Oh, he asked me but it's Lucy's birthday, I play with her band. That's right, it's my birthday. Tell me "happy birthday," Mark. - Aw, happy birthday, Lucy. - I promised her we'd celebrate and you should come. - Uh no man, I'm gonna go inside. - C'mon, Jimmy's havin' some fun up there. Hey where's the car? - Alright, alright, we're gonna go take a coffee break. Where's the car? - Y'know a couple people thought you'd be singin tonight but then Jimmy showed up. - Yeah, no man I'm not in the band anymore. - What happened? - Steve. They kick you out? - Are we walking out of town? - You weren't that bad, man. Y'know I got kicked out of my brother's band one time. - Man I didn't get kicked out. - You got a brother? What's your brother look like? - The fat version of me. No, thank you. - Shut up. - Maybe I drove. - Look man, we all get kicked out. I was about five, kept peein' myself, a big pee mess all over. Hey, I was just kidding! I didn't actually pee myself! Hey, I found the car! - So I'm thinkin' like Gee-Naw triggers something, you know, like a singin' cowboy, I know it's strange, but it's years ago. Hey buddy. You were in a movie with Alan Lad, huh? - Yeah, I was a kid I ran down the street in one of his movies. Oh that's cool. You know it does my heart good to see you guys back singin' after all this long, bad spell. Yeah I know I... thanks Kyle. - We were here just last week, Kyle. - I was-- - Wasn't that long a spell. - I was talkin' about Jimmy. - I heard you talkin', I didn't know what you meant. - Well it's anyway, it's good to have Jimmy back to singin' again. - Mark, Kyle was just sayin' earlier that uh you did a real good job while I was away. - Man, I'd still be doin' a good job if it wasn't for you and your stupid shit. - Hey, Mark. - Fuck you, Jim. - Hey, come on. - Fuck you! Son of a bitch! - C'mere, Mark! Son of a bitch. No! No! - Mark? Mark! - No! Get up, faggot! Get up! Get up, faggot! Faggot, get up! Get up! Get up, faggot! Get up! Oh man, oh man. I'm sorry. - Mark, where are you, what happened? Are you okay, did he hurt you? Baby, give a call home, I've gotta know you're okay. You know, you tell him that Mark, why don't you call home? I'm sittin' here waitin'. - Darlene? Tell him, he don't bother coming back here. Your son kicked me, hard. This is your son, right now. If you two don't get it figured out I'm through with the both of you. I mean it, Jimmy. - Yeah, I'll drive myself to the hospital. Don't wait up. I'm sittin' here waitin'. What are you doin' here so late? I have to talk to you. Can I talk to you? Yeah. Shut the door. - Maybe you should get a dog. - No dogs. Me and Jimmy got in a fight... at The Wrangler. - You came out lookin' alright. Yeah he didn't hit back. I just kept kickin' him. He took it. He just took it. I couldn't stop. You know I miss you? I don't want things to be this way. - It's the way it is. It's been like this for so many years. Every day I'm ashamed. No... no. - Your Daddy's always been there to hold you up. - Y'know I got no problem with him. - It's hard raisin' somebody else's boy. Jimmy always gave you what he's got. - That's no way to live. - Yes, it is. Yeah, it is. - I don't feel like it is. - You make it feel like you want. You're grown up, you figure it out. I've not met your wife. She's family now, she's there. You love her. Figure it out. I could make you a bed if you... I don't have that many blankets, but-- - You know, I better get on home. Don't ever feel ashamed. - Hi, I'd like to speak to somebody in the emergency area. Hey, James Poole came to you last night to get some stitches. I'm just checkin' in 'cause he didn't come home. - Are you a relative? He's my partner. - I'm not able to give that information out over the telephone unless you're a relative. We've been together 20 years. - You'll have to come down and see if another nurse will give you that information. - Is he there!? I'm not able to give you the information over the telephone unless you're a relative. I'll be right there. - Please let me know if you have any other questions. About time. - Mark. It's over. Can you hear me!? It's over! - James Poole, yes. He's in Room 140 right down there. - Why is he in a room? - You can go in and ask him. - I know, that was amazing. - I'll letcha go in. - No, it's okay if you come in, too. - He's got a lot of pride. I'll just wait out here. - Alright. - What's goin' on? What's goin' on, Jimmy? - The thing is, you're gonna be there for me. Long sufferin', actin' like you understand. - Jimmy! - You're gonna be a saint, you are baby boy, you are. - Why are you in here? - Uh... they gotta run tests. - Tests for what? - HIV. Seems I got the HIV. So, they gotta run more tests, see where it's at, see how my body's doin'... how long it's been. - They sure you got it? - Yeah. - So I might have it? - No. No, that's not likely. - I uh... I got nervous when you didn't come home last night. - Yeah, they drew blood and, y'know the whole place went on high alert. Yeah, I was a lot more popular when I walked in, boy howdy. - You feel alright? - Yeah, I feel fine. Uh, I'll be home in a couple hours. Why don't you take off? - No. I'll stay here. God. Go home. You can take the truck. - Kathy's here. I'll have her take me home. - You don't tell her. - Okay. You need anything? - No, I'll be home in a couple hours. What the hell was he doin' in there, what kinda bullshit was he up to? Three years, that's a long time. I know it is, Kath! Three years. It's a long, long time. Mark's not gonna know about this. Alright. - Hey. They getcha all stitched up? - Sure. Well, thanks for the garden book. You probly won't see it again. Yeah, probly got. - You guys take care. - It's going to be a bumpy night. - You get the bridles out of the garage? Yep. I'll see you later. - Where you goin'? - I'm going to aunt Kathy's. - Well... - You know for as long as we've been together I've felt sorta tainted... because of my family and all? Y'know and I felt you pitied me in a way that I guess makes me feel like a better person, but, what I'm beginning to realize is-- - I never said I was better-- - What I'm beginning to realize, is that you actually hate where I come from. - Jeez, I don't hate where you-- - I really thought that once you got to know me - Mark. - And know my family that you'd change. - What do you mean, "change"? - That you'd accept my family. - I believe what I believe. - Okay, well... you know there's a lot wrong with my ways of thinkin', and I know I gotta work on that. But I wasn't raised wrong, y'know in sin, or any of that. You can't see that because you're, you're a pretty hateful person. But I felt this was for a long time and I'm not gonna feel it anymore, not from my own wife. - You keep callin' it "hate" Mark. I call it walkin' with the Lord. Yeah, it's not right. What did you ever want from me, Darlene? - I wanted a good husband and I got one. You're not one of them. - You know, maybe I am. But that's my family. We're all goin' to hell if one of us is. It's not for me to say. - I've heard it all, Mark! I heard every part of it. You are either gonna believe all that, all the rationals they tell themselves about why they hold on hard to their sin, or you are gonna be saved! God bless you! - You want a hard candy? - No. - That's great. - My life's a mess. - I'm a bit surprised to see you. This your first time? - I came with Ty to Christmas a couple times. - So why you here now? - Should I go? 'Cause I haven't put enough money in the money basket? Do I have to pay you to be here? - What are you lookin' for, Jimmy? What are you lookin' for? - I don't know. Some wise words. - You read the Bible? - No. - You're willin' to try? - I don't think so. - What's in like in prison? - It's pretty confusing. - I'll bet. Back to drinkin'? - Little bit. You got a problem with that? - Sure. Do you? Man, I hate this. - What's that? Why do you hate this? - I gotta be pretty desperate to come here and talk to you. - Yeah, well, it hasn't been any big thrill for me yet, so far. Got a AA meeting in the other room on Tuesday nights. - Shit. - I'll go with you. No you will not, this is humiliatin'. - I'll go shopping for an hour, and then I'll come back and pick you up. Now get outta my truck. - Good evening. Hi everybody, my name is Toby, and I'm an alcoholic. Hi, Toby. - Let's open up tonight's meeting with a serenity prayer. God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things that I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Amen. Amen. - So is anybody here for the first time? Maybe somebody from out of town? - Yeah. - Where you goin'? - What's your name? - Brandy. - I'm Mark. - Yeah? Where you goin'? I'm gonna go check out my Dad's band play in a little bit. Be the last time I get to see 'em for a while. - Why's that? - Got a job in Branson, Missouri playin' a new band. Yeah we already got jobs lined up. - You're gonna be a big star. - Your mouth to God's ear. - Yeah? - Well, you wanna walk around for a bit, check it out? - Yeah. * Lord, get me out from behind the wheel of a UP Service van * Runnin' around in polyester brown is more than I can stand * Maybe I'm no box * You gotta take me to your hidin' spot * Prove to me I'm not just a UP Service man * Well I'm crackin' eggs at the crack of day * Can't crack a smile until half past eight * I can't get dressed as I concentrate I'm a UP Service man * and I start to race * And I leave home base at a hell of a pace * Parcel push goin' place to place, a UP Service man! * Get me out from behind the wheel of a UP Service van * Runnin' around in polyester brown is more than I can stand * Baby I'm no box * You gotta take me to your hidin' spot * Prove to me I'm not just a UP Service man! * I push eight hours of cardboard and crud * Limit 70 pounds and nothin' more * Baby you'd have to be a Schwarzenegger stud * In 11 hours you'd be fallin' to the floor! * Get me out, get me out * Get me out from behind the wheel of a UP Service van * Runnin' 'round in polyester brown is more than I can stand * Maybe I'll a box * You gotta take me to your hidin' spot * Prove to me I'm not just a UP Service man Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis has entered the building. * Lord get me out, get me out * Get me out, get me out * Get me out, get me out * Get me out from behind the wheel of a UP Service van * Runnin' 'round in polyester brown is more than I can stand * Maybe I'm no box * You gotta take me to your hidin' spot * Prove to me I'm not just a UP Service man, yeah * Prove to me I'm not just a UP Service man * Whoo!

Yeah of course. - Not right now. - No. So if you could just walk a couple steps off. Oh yeah, you got it, yeah. Thank you, that's good. Hey ladies and gentlemen, it's my good friend Jimmy Poole!

He really is sad that-- - You don't know him. - Just a little, I guess. - Yeah, that's right, just a little. And I know him a whole lot more than that. And I'm afraid for him. - Are you really? - Yes. - Why? - He's turning his back on a whole lot more than just me. You know about the rest of his family. - Yeah. - He's going to lose his way. - Well I hope not. - I hope not, too. I really do. Oop! Sorry. - Hey, slow down, gal. Morning.

What'd you do that for? - He deserves to know what's goin' on over here. - You tell him about you? About me? What about me? - About your condition. - My condition? About how I gots the devil's HIV? - Did you tell him? Yes, I did. - Why? That's so selfish. - To tell him that I'm havin' problems with my health? - You don't be communicatin' with him. Well, you got no control over that. - You're the worst thing that ever happened to him. - No, that's not true. - All of it. The drinkin', the violence, the messin' around in prison. And now you bring your disease into this house!? - Well, I'm not drinkin'. - Fuck you! - Drinkin's why all this happened. You were sick, and you didn't tell me! No, I-- - I found a Band-Aid in the trash can. The one they give you when they check your blood in prison. You knew, Jimmy! - I couldn't tell you. Look at you. I don't know what you were doin' in prison. I don't wanna know. But I can't live with the fear of HIV under my own roof. I hate that I'm that weak. That's the way it is. Tyler don't move outta here. I'll be back for more things when you're not here. * Love your neighbors, treat them well * All the stories they could tell you * About the hard ways around * Love your neighbor, be good to yourself * Get to mending, mending fences * 'Stead of tearing them down * It's rocky before us, we'll stumble sometimes * But no rest for the weary * Walk on in the light * Open up your arms to another who failed * Love, love all your neighbors * Treat them well * Treat them well * Treat them well You guys go on in. That the baler horse? Yeah. She's lookin' real good this year. She should do well. Hey, you got a second? Yeah. I'll take her. Alright. You boys take your time. Horse has come a long way. Mm. - I passed you on the road today. Just seemed like a good idea to keep goin'. I know you saw me and I'm sure that must've been rough. I just wanted to come down and tell you I didn't mean to hurt you. - Aw that's bullshit. - No, it isn't. - Yeah, it's bullshit. You're so full of goodness, you couldn't hurt a fly. - Cut it out. - When it comes to one time too many, get outta the way 'cause hell hath no fury. How many times does it have to be? Huh? How many times do I gotta come in second to what you're drinkin' before I get to say it's too damn much? It's too damn much. - How do you even know? What? - You hardly ever come up for air, Ty. You're so right, and you're so perfect that the rest of us are just a little lonely. You're so good and nothin' seems to shake you from that. Does it? I'm surprised that I found the line in the sand. - You got HIV, Jimmy. - Yeah. - That scares me to death. - Alright. You slept with, I don't know how many people in prison. I slept with one person. - Don't tell me. - No. - Don't talk about it. - One time. Deny it! Just deny it, Jimmy! - That's what I'm talkin' about. - I don't know how you got HIV, but somethin' real strong tells me nobody forced you to do anything you didn't want to do. And if there's one thing you coulda used all your fightin' for is to stay clean for me. And you didn't. And then you lied about it. - I am messed up. That's not news. I'm the same way as I was when we fell for each other. Yeah, yeah I've heard it. I gotta go. - I am messed up, but what I do know Is that you-- - Is that you're a drunk? 'Cause you're lonely? You're a drunk 'cause you're lonely? - No, I've stopped drinkin'. It's easy for you, okay. But I'm all over the map. And if there's one thing that's kept me flyin' right it's you and Mark. My family. And give or take, I have been there, kickin' in, doin' my part for a lotta years. - You're the love of my life. You're the love of my life. - You can't hide away on this one. I don't know how I'm gonna forgive you. I don't think I can! You got to. * Lay it down, lay it down * Lay it softly to sleep * Only to rise up in dreamin' * Dreamin' seems to be the way to make a dream come true * Lay it down * I've traveled in and out of me * Where you alone would follow * I hold on to believin' in what's passed me by * When I'm tired from so much trouble * You look at me in all your serenity * And once again you tell me why * I've laid it down * So lay it down * Lay it softly to sleep * Only to rise up in dreamin' * Dreamin' seems to be the way to make a dream come true * Lay it down * I've always dreamed of you * Lay it down * It's all you have to do - Night, Jimmy. - Alright, goodnight, thank you very much. - I'll see ya Tuesday. - Alright. - What's Tuesday? - A meeting. So, this is a sweet ride, huh? - Yeah rentals don't need much personality. - Well that's a good thing. So you decided to come all the way home just to watch us squirm. - I came home for Thanksgiving but, watching ya'll squirm is a bonus. - You're brave. Ty's supposed to make the side dish, 'course he's already at Kathy's so now I have to make one. - Lord help us - Yeah, I can't come empty handed, so I'm gonna bring green beans. - Look, I'll eat whatever you cook up. Alright, you can't make a face. - I won't. Yeah this's gonna be weird. Yeah, it's gonna be weird. I gotta walk into this nightmare sober. - I'm proud of you. - Yeah just when I'm about to off myself these people come up to me all huggin' and hand over a colorful poker chip. All's right with the world. Right? So how's everything with your health? - You're just gonna go ahead and ask. - You takin' care of things? - I'm in denial at the moment. But, I don't have anything to worry about for quite a while, so as long as I'm a good soldier. - You gonna be smart? - Yeah, I'm gonna be smart, shut up. - Alright. - So what's he sayin' about me. - Who? You know, he loves you so much. You're lyin'. - No-- - You're a liar. - I swear, you know, I can tell and he... he really misses you. - It's gonna be awful. I can't wait. - Let's go home. - Hey, c'mere boy. - Good to see you. It's good to see you. Hey, Jimmy. Happy Thanskgiving. Alright, thank you, Happy Thanksgiving. - You got to ride in the chariot. - Oh yeah, she's a mean machine alright. - You look good. - Psh, I'm about to crawl out of my skin. - Let's go inside. - You know, stoppin' drinkin' is supposed to be good for a person and, man-oh-man this is... - Hey. - I saw your picture in the paper. - That dopey photo? - No, it wasn't.
