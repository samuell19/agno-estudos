The dome of the Spruce Goose.' 'Yogi Bear's Holiday Jollyday Tours did it again.' What did he do? Got us where he said he would. Where we were supposed to be. Here. The right place even. (Huck) 'And we only got lost five times.' (Augie) 'Four if you don't count Pismo Beach.' Believe me, son. Pismo Beach don't count. It's getting late, Yogi. Let's go. Right you are, Boo Boo. Gosh! California sure is pretty. (Yogi) 'Quick Draw McGraw.' The sunshine, the ocean, them trees with the pointy leaves. - 'Quick Draw McGraw.' - And everybody knows your name. He's here, Yogi. I'm not so sure about that, Huck. Huckleberry Hound. I'm here, I guess. That's a good guess, Huck. Snagglepuss? Guilty as charged, your honor. 'Tis I, 'tis me. The very same even. (Yogi) 'Augie Doggie?' Augie Doggie's right here with my dear old Doggie Daddy. In person. I don't believe I caught your name. There it is right there. Boo Boo. Right you are, Boo Boo. With a B and an O and a booboo-be-doo. All present and accounted for. Attention! 'To the Spruce Goose, forward march.' 'Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four.' You're gonna have to hurry, it's almost closin' time. Not to worry. This is the quickie-quickie tour. In and about, round and out, hurry, hurry, hurry. Uh, mind if I ask a stupid question? I don't think that'll surprise anyone. Thank you. Uh, what exactly is this here Spruce Goose we come to see? (male announcer) 'Welcome to the home of the Spruce Goose.' 'The largest plane ever built.' 'And more unusual, the body of this plane' 'is built entirely of wood.' 'Here is the actual film of its only flight 40 years ago.' 'The pilot is Howard Hughes' 'the man who built the Spruce Goose.' 'And now, here it is for you to see for yourself.' 'The world's largest aircraft, the one and only Spruce Goose.' - Gosh! - It sure is cute, ain't it? It's gigantic, stupendous, bigger than a breadbox even. (Augie) 'Its wings are longer than a football field, dear ol' dad.' (Doggie) 'That's amazing.' 'But who wants to play football on the wing of an airplane?' 'Especially when it's flyin'.' This way if you please. Stay close behind me. We don't want anyone gettin' lost. (Boo Boo) Especially you. I resemble that remark, Boo Boo. I have a native animal instinct. I'm never lost. Now, men, onward and upward, let's go, go, go. Hup, hup, hup, hup. Hup, hup, hup, hup.. Shhee. Sorry ol' buddy, but my go-go-go just went-went-went. But look, Boo Boo. 'A genuine shortcut for us tourist detectors.' - But, Yogi.. - 'Trust me, Boo Boo.' 'All aboard the Spruce Goosie.' In a moment you won't believe your eyes. (Doggie) 'You're right. I don't believe my eyes.' 'Because they ain't seein' nothin'.' (Yogi) 'I'll open the door and shed some light' 'on the situation here.' [Yogi grunting] [grunting] thud (Snagglepuss) 'Yogi, you alright?' (Yogi) 'Light another match, I can't see a thing.' Light another match, Snagglepuss. You okay, Yogi? Cancel the tour, Boo Boo. I can't see a thing. Anyone got a nail file, a hairpin, a can opener even? [grunting] Yeow! Nice catch, Quick Draw. You're rootin' tootin' welcome, partner. Don't panic, men. Jolly Day Tours has a contingency plan for just such an emergency. It's time for one concentrated effort. Ready? (all) Help! [horn blaring] Closing time. Everybody out. (Yogi) 'Okay, gang. Here we go with plan B.' On the count of three, we go. Augie, my son, I appreciate your spirit, but.. You are right, oh, thoughtful and considerate, dad. (Yogi) 'One.' I'll just wait over here out of harms way, oh, father of mine. That's my obedient son. - 'Two.' - Is this okay, dad? Oops! - 'Golly!' - 'Three.' Charge! thud Uh, I think I found a way out. Now, he tells us. Step right this way, troop. Your trusty guide will have you out of here in a jiffy. Get a load of this place. Why it's bigger than the Orpheum even. Upsy-daisy, now. Just a step or two and we'll be.. ...lost. (Boo Boo) 'Did you say we're lost, Yogi?' No. I said not all is lost, Boo Boo. I've guided us to the control room. I'll have us out of here in half a second. Gosh! What a fancy aerial plane. Heavens to Murgatroyd! - I feel just like an astronaut. - Gee. How's a guy to know which thingamajig opens the door. I don't know, Yogi. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Eenie meenie miney mo. Which button will open the door? Augie, my boy, I got a feeling this is one tour we're gettin' more than our money's worth. Hmm. Nothin' is workin' down here. I wonder if any of these switches work. I give up. I must have pushed everything on this dashboard. Except, except one. click Bingo! [all beeping] Oh, no! Y-Yogi. whirr Gee. Yogi's sure givin' us a super tour. - What a stupendousproduccion. - Sure is. Dang it, but don't feel like.. (both) ...we're movin'! Yogi. We're moving. Do something. In case you haven't noticed, old buddy, I did. Whoa! You can say that again. (both) Whoa! These are the best special effects I've ever seen. [all screaming] Hey, hey, hey. You can look up now, little guy. It isn't scary anymore. I be-believe you but my b-body doesn't. Relax, Boob. Enjoy the special effects. Those Spruce Goose people sure put on a good show. 'It feels like we're really movin', doesn't it?' It even looks like we're movin'. If it feels like we're moving and it looks like we're moving I got a strange idea, Yogi. I think we're moving. Ridiculous, Boob. It's just an optical illusion. [intense music] Yogi! Yeow! I got to admit that's the best optical delusion I ever saw. - Where are you going? - To get the rest of the gang. They're missin' all the fun. You can't leave. You're the pilot. You gotta steer. Those things don't really work, Boo Boo. They're just part of the show. See. Be right back. [intense music] Hey, hey, hey. So tell me, how do you like the tour so far? Uh, come out, come out where ever you are. - Is it over? - Can we go home now? I echo those sentiments in extreme exactitude. That's my dear ol' daddy who said that. And that goes double for me too. Me three. Quadruple even. Do I detect an undercurrent of dissatisfaction amongst the troops? I couldn't have put it better myself if I only knew what he was talkin' about. It's more than an undercurrent. It's a ground swirl, a tidal wave even. Dang it all, Yogi! We wanna know what's goin' on? Uh, that is what we wanna know, ain't it? [all clamoring] Yogi, Yogi. You guys, look at Boob here. A satisfied passenger on this Holiday Jolly Day Tour. Is he yelling and screaming like it's the end of the world? Yogi, Yogi. - What is it, Boob? - It's the end of the world. We're gonna crash into the bridge. You see, we're just gonna crash into the.. Oops! Yep, that's the bridge alrighty. Let's see what this does. (all) Whoa! There. Now, that wasn't so bad, was it? Another example of perfect co-ordination. And dumb luck. Look out! (Boo Boo) 'We're gonna crash.' [intense music] Well. Hey, hey, hey. (all) Yogi's flying the Spruce Goose. It appears this better than average bear is also your better than average fly boy. Uh, fly bear. Yogi, this isn't special effects. - You're really flying. - So? You don't know how to fly a plane. Shh. You know it and I know it. But don't tell the Spruce Goose. Relax, Boo Boo. Enjoy. Put on some music. This is a night to rember. [instrumental music] Look, Yogi, stardust. Naturally, Boob. You're with a star. We're all stars, Yogi. Heh heh. That's my son who said that. (Doggie) 'Lookit there, Augie. That there is the Doggie star.' Take a look at that there Sagittarius, Quick Draw. Well, what do you know. That Sagi whatchamacallit sure looks familiar. Look, Huck, a miracle. 'A heavenly mirage even.' 'I'm finally up there in lights.' [pan flute music] [neighing] [neighing] [neighing] Hold on there, ya horse thief. [instrumental music] [snorts] Wow! Yogi's Jolly Day Tours sure beats all. Stupendous even. But what's he gonna do for an encore? [intense music] - Firkin. - Firkin, Merkin. Telex to Gogax. Prepare for invasion. Earth is helpless. Advance scouts Merkin and Firkin will take over the United States of California. Merkin and Firkin, you and me. Goody, good, good. We will now transform to Earth people so we can mingle among them undetected. Yeah. Goody, good, good. Stand by for.. Aah! [intense music] - What was that? - I didn't see anything. (Snagglepuss) 'I know. That's why we almost hit it.' Uh, Firkin. Yes, Merkin. Let's invade New Jersey. (man on radio) 'An incredible ice storm has marooned' 'thousands of animals at the South Pole.' 'They're landlocked, unable to get food.' 'Penguins, seals, polar bears, all trapped' 'by the most powerful Arctic storm in history.' 'Every rescue attempt has failed.' 'No one can get through.' Boo Boo, they haven't counted on the Spruce Goose. (Boo Boo) 'Yogi, where are we going?' (Yogi) 'See that herd of pelicans flyin' out there, Boob?' 'We're doing what they and all the other birds do.' 'We're flying to the South Pole for the winter.' (Boo Boo) Birds fly south where it's warm, Yogi. Not to the South Pole. The South Pole is the winter. Ice storms! Blizzards! We'll freeze to death. We'll get sniffles even. A-achoo, already. Listen again, boys and bears. (man on radio) 'Thousands of animals in the South Pole' 'are doomed to starvation.' 'A sudden shift in the ice pack' 'has blocked their lanes to the sea.' [animals clamoring] 'They're completely surrounded and cut off' 'from all food supply.' [squawking] 'Only a miracle can save them.' In case you didn't know every Yogi Bear Holiday Jolly Day Tour comes with miracles included. At no extra charge. [wind gusting] (Quick Draw) How much is the tour without miracles? You couldn't afford it. [rumbling] (both) Ouch! Hey, hey, hey. We hit a pothole in the sky. Better fasten our seatbelts. And tell the others to buckle up too. [engine revving] (all) Ow! Good thinking, co-pilot, Boo Boorino. Let's see. Which one turns on the fasten seatbelt sign? 'That's not it.' whirr 'Not that one either.' [all screaming] thud [all screaming] thud [all screaming] thud [all screaming] thud thud [all screaming] thud [all screaming] thud Attention, please. This is your captain speaking. We might be encountering mild turbulence. That's pilot talk for dipsy-doos and loop de loops. So I suggest you fasten your seatbelts. Sure is nice of you to warn us like that, Yogi. - Yeah. But I got a question. - Shoot. Any more of them loop de loops and dipsy-doos and I just might do that. My question is if you're the captain, who's flying the plane? Good question. You've heard of the automatic pilot? Well, when I'm with you this Spruce Goose is on automatic Boo Boo. Well, of course. Naturally. What else even. Makes sense to me. Sure do. - Hi, Boo Boo. - I got another question. Since you're both out here, I guess the plane is set on automatic crash landing? swoosh Hey, hey, hey. [grunting] (Boo Boo) 'Harder, Yogi. Harder.' I am. I am! swoosh 'Hey, hey, hey. We made it.' 'And what's more we made it to the right place. Look' (Boo Boo) 'What do you know. I-It's a sign.' (Huck) 'It says, "Welcome you-all."' (Yogi) 'Yep, that's the South Pole alright. You-all.' 'Is that your heart poundin' with excitement, Boob?' Oh, I don't know what it is, Yog. Can't see too well from here, Boob. Have somebody stick his head out and look around. I'll do it. I love anythin' to do with the South. What do you see, Huck? You see the marooned animals, Huck? Huck. - Huck. - Well, look what we have here. A frozen pupsicle. Ha ha ha. Pupsicle get it. Pupsicle. I got it. Now, how do I get rid of it? Urban furban burfle bee. I can't make out what he's sayin'. He said urban furban burfle bee. What does that mean? We'll find out in a second. You're a-lookin' at the fastest hammer in the West. Are you alright, Huck? Urban furban burfle bee. I told you all that's what he said. But what does it mean? There's a baby pelican out there on the burfle bee. I mean, uh, on the wing. - And he's hurt. - You're right, Huck. 'There is a baby pelican bird out there.' [squeaking] I bet he's been making those bumpity-bumps. 'And he does look hurt.' Oh, boy. You better believe it. There's no way we can go and get the little feller. Is there? Of course, not. Ridiculous. Beyond possible. Beyond beyond even. Sure there is, Mr. Snagglepuss. That's my boy who said that. With these. Ah, plungers. My thought exactly. On the nose, on the button. On the wing even. Huh? That's my line. Everybody wants to get into the act. Well, here goes. 'Hang on, little birdie.' 'I'm a-comin'. I'm a-comin'.' squawk I'm a-comin' for to carry you home. He's got him. [all cheering] (Yogi) Tape, string. (Doggie) Tape, string. (Yogi) Sandpaper, more string. (Augie) Sandpaper, more string. (Yogi) Hammer and saw. Hammer and saw? Alright, glue. Super or not so super? Super, super-duper even. Finished. Give her a flip-flop, little birdie and see how she feels. I can fly. I can fly. [kisses] Thank you, doc. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Now, I can join my mommy in Miami for the winter. You're welcome to stay with us. We're flying South too. Thanks all the same, fellas, but I want my mommy. Ain't that cute? Okie-dokie, little buckaroo. Here it goes. [whirring] Hey, hey, hey. We did it, Boob. Not only did we help another human being animal bird creature. But we also got rid of those bumpity-bump noises. thud thud thud Boo Boo, let's rally the troops and see what's goin' on. thud thud thud thud I think we're gettin' closer. Good guess, Quick Draw. Everybody stand back. I'm scared, dear ol' dad. Me too. Anything could be in there. An alien, a monster. A slimy, gooey, monster. A creature from a black, slimy, gooey, lagoon. A little boy even. Take that back, bug face, before I slug you. I'm a girl! (all) A girl? You wanna make somethin' of it? Good. Now, where does a woman go to freshen up around here? (Huck) 'Can you imagine she's been locked in here all this time.' Heh heh. No wonder she wanted to freshen up. Hmm. If you ask me she's pretty fresh already. My name is Snagglepuss. Right this way, you little delicate blossom you. I may be little, Snag, but I'm no delicate blossom. That's for darn sure. (girl) 'I can talk about myself that way.' But when you say it, you better smile partner. Okie-dokie, little lady. [babbling] Oh, that ain't fair. You can't smile and talk at the same time. And you can't whistle Dixie neither. I could always whistle Dixie. Easy. Simmer, simmer. Relax even. What she means is she's a girl type, female woman person. And wants a little respect, right? I'm a W-O-M-A-N woman. Yeah. Good for you, Bernice. Brava, bravissimo even. - Bernice? - Her name is Bernice? Right. And if anybody calls me Bernie, I'll slug 'em. Cease, desist and stop even. Violence never settled anything. Yeah. Well, tell that to the last kid who called me Bernie. Hey, hey, hey. Everybody getting palsy-walsy? Uh, not exactly-wakly. Take the wheel, Boob. I believe my better than average wisdom is need here. Bernice was just gonna tell us how come she's here. Right, Bernice? Well, I was on the Spruce Goose tour with my parents got lost and woke up locked in that room. Sounds like she made the same dumb mistake we did. Mistake? I beg to disagree, contrary wise, my friends. We're here by cosmic chance. Off on a great adventure. A magical mystery of mercy. Huh? Say that again? I can't. Hey, hey, hey. He simply reiterated that we both goofed it. Yogi, Yogi, come here. Captain Yogi here, co-pilot Boo Boo. Look over yonder. Over yonder. Nicely put. (Augie) 'It's the landlocked animals we've been looking for' 'dear ol' dad.' (Doggie) 'That's my boy who said that.' [barking] [squawking] [whimpering] (Huck) 'I bet that little feller's real hungry.' (Boo Boo) 'I think they're all hungry.' (Augie) 'And they can't get to the ocean.' (Doggie) 'The ice has sealed of the seals.' Well, we're gonna unseal 'em. Fasten your seatbelts, boys and bears. And who else, fuzzy? Shee. Boys, bears and Bernice. - That's better. - We're goin' in.' The Spruce Goose is gonna turn 'em loose. 'Go, go, Yogi.' - 'That's our captain speakin'.' - 'Who else.' (Snagglepuss) 'The brown bear himself.' [barking] [squawking] splash E-eeow! (Boo Boo) 'Y-Yogi, what are we gonna do?' We're gonna crack through the ice. And open a channel to the ocean. But that ice is 10, maybe 20 feet thick. Thirty even. Gosh, Yogi. It can't be done. If this is the plane that couldn't be built it oughta do things that can't be done. Hey, hey, hey. [squawking] (Yogi) 'Hey, hey, hey. Happy landing.' splash [intense music] Hey, hey, hey. Get out of the way. (both) Phew! Yike! Do-si-do and away we go. Hey, what did I say. You're doing it, Yogi. You're doing it. [barking] [all clamoring] (Boo Boo) 'Yogi, look!' 'Pull up, pull up.' rumble [all clamoring] [all cheering] Hip, hip. (all) Hurray. Hip, hip. (all) Hurray! Hip, uh.. Uh, hip, uh.. (in unison) 'Hurray!' Guess, I'm a hero type. You're a hero type alright. When did you know we could do it, yogi? (Yogi) 'Right after we did it.' Now we better buckle up and get out of here-- - 'Hold it!' - Uh! We can't go yet. Look. (Yogi) 'You're right. We gotta save these little guys' 'in the fancy suits.' [squawking] chomp (Yogi) 'They can't get to land because they're surrounded by sharks.' 'But how do we save a whole herd of penguins?' Surrounded by ferocious sharks even. I'll have to put on my better than average thinking cap. I know how we can save 'em. But you probably wouldn't take an idea from a girl. I'm an open minded bear. Okay. Well, then here's my idea.. [whispering] Hey. Hey, hey, hey! [whirring] [whistling] Hey, you guys! Over here. On the double. [instrumental music] Alright! Oops! Easy, Bernice. Uh, somebody out there. Bernice? Bernice! [gasping] [dramatic music] Bernice, Bernice! [chattering] Oh, no! 'Where did Bernice go?' This is terrible. This is awful. A catastrophe. It's a lots worse down here. Uh! This has become another remake of "Jaws." Bernice! Hey, hey, hey. You're okay. [chattering] chomp Come on down. Join me for a bite. Hold on, Bernie baby. I'll have you up in a swifty-jiffy. 'I told you not to call me Bernie.' thud That goes for you too, buster. Sorry, Bernice. [grunting] Here we go. Careful. Remember what you told me. It's slippery up there. Not to worry, little one. We bears are among the most sure footed of all creatures. Whoops! So much for a sure footed creatures. Thanks, Yogi. Yogi? Yogi! Hey, hey, hey, you guys. Make bigger circles. Hang on, Yogi. p-taff It's my turn for a good turn. Uh, I-I suppose you're hungry. Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Me too. Where do they get the picnic baskets around here? chomp clang Gee! First it's penguins. Then it's little girls. Now it's bears. You'll eat anything, won't ya? (in unison) Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going for help. Hang on tight. I'm hanging on tight. And I'm sliding down fast. [chattering] [dramatic music] chomp Hey, hey, hey. Blah, blah, blah. Hey, hey, hey! Hey! (in unison) Hey, hey, hey. [instrumental music] [whirring] [chattering] Now I know what a hamster feels like. Come on, Quick Draw. Move it. Yogi needs help. Hold on there, missy. I don't take a hankering to your newfangled pushy ways. How about an old fashioned bomp on the bean? 'Well, that's different.' As long as Yogi needs help. Let's go. chomp chomp chomp (Quick Draw) 'Hold on there, partner.' I'll have you up in a minute. You wanna help Yogi? Easy! A snap. A mere snip-snap, I might say. How? Just turn on the propeller. And it'll him swing back on up. I'll show you. Demonstrate even. A flip of this. A flap of that. thwack [whirring] boing Put it there, pal. Hey, hey, hey. Quick thinking, Quick Draw. [clapping] A turn of this. A twist of that. Come on, let's go back in. I'm freezin'. Me too. But first I gotta do something. Better luck next time, you wild and crazy bear eaters. Hey! And now we push this red one here. [whirring] [screaming] (in unison) Ah! (inunison) Yeah, yeah, yeah. splash Yogi, look. [dramatic music] [whistling] [shivering] [instrumental music] chomp chomp Phew! [cheering] Sure indeed is real a friend in need. A big buddy. Aah! A whale of a tale. Thanks a bunch. Yep! Most obliged, partner. splash (Yogi) 'Spruce Goose to South Pole control tower.' 'Ready for take off.' [chattering] [barking] [instrumental music] [whirring] [chiming] - Firkin. - Firkin, Merkin. Kelax to Gogax. Prepare for invasion of Earth by sea. Earth is hopeless. Advance scouts Merkin and Firkin will take over abandoned ocean liner. That carries only weird Earth creature. Merkin and Firkin. You and me. Good, good, good. But what about that great big flying thing we saw before? The...you know.. Shh! There's no giant flying thing. No you know. We imagined it. Gogax commands we conquer Earth or we're doomed. Gogax! Gogax! Go, go, go! (Merkin) 'I still think we saw the giant you know what?' (male announcer)An ocean linerloaded with animals is adrift in the Zelman Sea. The criminal poachers whoillegally trap the animals have abandoned the ship. Leading hundreds of poorcreatures of the wild to their doom on the high seas. (Yogi) 'Wrong, Mr. Announcer.' Co-pilot Boo Boo. I know, Captain Yogi. Head for the Zelman Sea. Boo Boo's the best. Where is it, Yogi? Where is the Zelman Sea? You don't know and I don't know. But I bet you a billion bazoos. The Spruce Goose will get us there. [instrumental music] (Boo Boo) 'Yogi?' (Yogi) 'Uh, what is it, Boo Boo?' (Boo Boo) Are you sure The Spruce Goose knows where the Zelman Sea is? (Yogi) 'Does a bear live in the woods?' Of course it does. It has natural instincts. Just like me. That's a relief. Thanks for reassuring me, Yogi. (Yogi) 'Thank nothing of it, Boo.' [Yogi yawning] 'Wake me up when we get there.' (Boo Boo) 'Sure thing, Yog.' 'Ah, Yogi?' [Yogi snoring] Yogi? snore snore Yogi! Uh! Oh. Uh? Hey, hey, hey. Is it spring already? We are flying in the Spruce Goose, Yogi. Remember? But of course, Boo. And you woke me up. Which means we've arrived at the Zelman's Sea. And we're ready to save the animals. Which are adrift on the abandoned ocean liner. How is that for a quick story recap? Hmm. I don't seem to see the ocean liner, Boo. (Boo Boo) 'That's because there isn't one, Yogi.' Then indeed there is no need to wake up a slumbering bear, Boo. I need my Z's. Let me know when we get there. [grunting] snore snore Hmm. Yogi! scream So soon? We're lost, Yogi. We can't find the animals. We can't find the ocean liner. We can't find the Zelman Sea. We're lost. Lost. Lost! - You mean-- - Yes. Ridiculous. I'll find the Zelman Sea. [instrumental music] Where's the map, Boo Boo? Right here, Yogi, but.. Round and round she goes.. ...and where she stops nobody knows, but me. 'And that'll be the Zelman Sea.' (Yogi) 'And here we are. Hey, hey, hey.' Yeah, but.. But, Yogi, how did you do that? If you won't tell. I won't tell. Oh, you can trust me, Yogi. I won't tell. Good. And neither will I. Right. Wait a minute. - 'Firkin.' - 'Firkin, Merkin.' Kelax to Gogax. Advance scouts Merkin and Firkin. Taking over abandoned ocean liner. Step one to Earth invasion. Oh, goody. Good. Good. We will now transform to Earth animals so we can mingle among them undetected. [instrumental music] (in unison) 'Well, what do you think?' Goody, good. good. They'll never know we are not one of them. (Boo Boo) 'There it is, Yogi, the ocean liner.' 'You found it.' (Yogi) 'Spruce Goose coming in for landing.' swoosh - 'Park it, Firkin.' - 'Firkin, parkin', Merkin.' Stand by for.. What! It's another giant flying thing. But you said we just imagined.. [mumbling] whoosh [screaming] - Yeow! - Yeow! Hey, hey, hey. I'm excited too. No. It's another flying saucer. Dinner plate. Platter even. Just like the one we saw before. Tish tosh and tosh tish. You know there's no such thing as a flying saucer. Any how I missed it. Lucky for us. If you would have hit it. You wouldn't have missed it. That's my dad, who said that. Ah, Firkin. Firkin, Merkin. That's two giant flying things. - Biggy big, you know what's? - I know. I know, you know what after you know what's? And you know, I know about the you know what's. - But Gogax. - He doesn't know. - What? - About the you know what's. - No. - Merkin tell him? No Firkin tell him. No. - So? - I don't know. (in unison) I know. Let's invade New Jersey. screech whirr whirr swoosh [instrumental music] On behalf of Captain Yogi and his crew Boo Boo. That's me. 'We'd like to thank you for flying Spruce Goose Airlines.' That's darn nice of you, Boo. We didn't have much of a choice, Quick Draw. That's my boy who said that. There'll be a brief stop over here at the Zelman Sea. While we rescue a ship full of animals. 'We ask those of you who continuing on with us' 'not to go out and stretch your legs.' Or you'll fall in the ocean. Look at those poor things. (Bernice) 'Captured by low down sneaky poachers' 'and then abandoned at sea.' Okay, Yogi, ol' pal, ol' chum. You got us to the right place. Now what's your plan? Plan? Plan? Who said plan? Did I say anything about a plan? You gotta have an idea. A thought. A light bulb over your head. [fingers snapping] clang [pulsating] There's no opening big enough to take 'em on board. So.. (in unison) So? So. We tow. (in unison) We'll tow. Okie-dokie. All tied with a perfect cowboy half hitch knot. And a sailor's double clove hitch. With a sheepshank. And a triple axle of the low board. In tuck position even. All clear, Captain Yogi, sir. Ready to tow. Aye! Aye! And hey, hey, hey. Start the engines. [whirring] (Boo Boo) 'Engines started, Captain Yogi.' (Yogi) 'Good work, Co-pilot Boo Boo.' 'Standby to tow.' (Boo Boo) 'Standing by to tow, Captain Yogi.' Where to? - Hmm? - Where to, Captain Yogi? Where are we towing the ship to? Nobody has brought that up before, Boo Boo.

I think that might mean somebody else is here. And they're calling for our help. Gosh! That's darn clever of you to figure it out, Yogi. Let's the gang together and start a search party. Great!

Huh! The kid is our ticket to the Spruce Goose. Huh! I'll keep going this way. You guys, look over there. But Yogi told us not to split up, Bernice. It could be dangerous. I can take care of myself, Augie. We'll just get done faster that's all. That's for me. I'm dog tired. 'Of course you are, dear ol' dad.' You're a doggie. Ha ha ha. That's my boy who said that.

But it won't be because it's a good deed. Right. It'll be an act of desperate desperation. His last resort. Snatch of victory from his job to feed even.
