♪♪[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] DAN: Even in Hollywood, a town as wide open as a B-girl's arms, there were still a few things that were supposed to be against the law. And high stakes gambling was one of them. But that didn't stop the high rollers and the would-be's from pouring in every night to the back room of the Limelight Club, a ritzy dive that offered Las Vegas action right here in the land of fruits and nuts. Want to try this now? Come on, come on, come on. Oh. Hey, Criqui, how many time are these same numbers gonna show up? DAN: Pedro Criqui was the joint's owner. He was a schizophrenic little guy, half Spanish and half French, who'd been in more hot water than a used tea bag. Hey, Turner. How's Hollywood's favorite private dick? Not bad, Pedro. Who's the weasel with Maizie Murdock? I'm ready. Deadbeat. Always complaining, always broke. He says I give him loaded dice, that son of a bitch. It looks like your dice aren't the only things loaded tonight. Dan. Oh, you big lug. Where you been hiding yourself? Oh, well, here and there. How about you, hon? I've been pining away. You'd have helped by giving my phone a jingle. Oh, it looks like you've already got a boyfriend. He can't take your place, Dan. Nobody can take your place.Hey, Maizie. It's just...What do you say we get out of this sleazy joint? I'm tired of playing with funny dice. You'd better scram. Come on, Junior. We better leave before Criqui has a fit. So long, handsome. I'll be waiting by my phone. Keep your powder dry, sweetheart. Funny dice. I'll give him funny dice. See who I gotta deal with? Deadbeats, drunks. DAN: Yeah, and cops. CRIQUI: Cops? Oh, shoot. What do they want from me this time? Take a gander. Gentlemen, how nice of you to drop in on a night like this. Criqui, you're breaking the rules. That makes my boss mad...This is a busy night. Do you have to be here now?...maybe close your place down. DAN: For me, it was just a harmless night out in Tinseltown. Or so I thought. As it turned out, I should've stayed home with my radio and a bottle of VAT 69 for company. CRIQUI: ...a lot of nice people having harmless fun. I don't care if it's harmless fun. The captain's getting pressure.Yeah, yeah. You got roulette tables over there, Criqui. I see them. CRIQUI: Oh, come on. Come on.And the boss knows about it. You better cut this crap out. Turner?Hello, Cromwell. Dan, please, you gotta help me. I do, huh? How come? My God, the police. Come on. You're a director, not a star. Nobody cares... No, no, no, that's-- that's not it. There's a girl. There's always a girl, Roy. Please, you don't understand. I get caught with this girl, my life is over. You got to get her out of here.Hold it. Who is she?Over here. Hurry. Please? Sure. What're pals for? Dan, she's in here. Holy mackerel, Roy. You really are a pal. This is Dan Turner and you can trust him. Roy...He'll get you out of here. Goodbye, darling.Roy... I'm sorry. It has to be this way. Aren't you Vala Duvalle? That's right. So what? So I've seen a couple of your pictures. You're not bad. Hmm, thanks. You're not so bad yourself. Aren't you Bernie Ballantyne's squeeze, the head of the studio? Yeah, I guess you could say that. Brother, I think I've just been sucker punched. This is a raid! Everybody stay put! Well, how about it, handsome? You gonna save my reputation? I'll try. MAN: Hey, what's going on? Wonder how long it's been since Pedro's had this joint fumigated? CROWD: Fire, fire! DAN: We got fire, folks. [ALL CLAMORING] WOMAN: Come on! Well, well, Dan Turner, Hollywood detective. Hiya, Dave. I thought that burning ashcan had your name on it. Can't blame a guy for trying. We're chums. Yes, I guessed that part. What's a real live movie star doing with a cheapie like him? Well, even movie stars get lonesome, Dave. You know, you could do me a favor right now. Sorry, ace. I'm fresh out of favors. I got a job to do. Sorry, beautiful. I tried. Okay, folks. Fire drill's over. DAN: I felt bad for that doll, but Donaldson didn't bend the rules. We were caught, and like a sap I thought that was the end of it. Tough luck, but if you're a right guy, sometimes you take the lumps. DAN: A few months went by and sometimes I even stopped thinking about Vala Duvalle. Her husband, Bernie Ballantyne, head of Paravox Studios, had been a steady client but that was history. And I didn't see a single nickel from Paravox in all that time. Somehow Roy Cromwell forgot to send me a thank you card, but maybe he was busy. That's okay. I was pretty busy myself. Now, hon, you just ankle back to your bungalow, pour yourself a nice soothing drink and relax. And if I haven't found your cat by tomorrow, I'm not the guy I think I am. Well, now, Roy Cromwell. The magician who turns his pals into chumps. Turner, I want to explain. There's nothing to explain. Sometimes a guy just has to take some lumps for a pal. That's life. Yeah, I know. I haven't been much of a pal lately. We had some laughs. You got me some work, now you lost me some. I guess we're square. It's not your problem that I'm poison over at Paravox lately. Yeah, you see, it is my problem, Dan. I feel like such a heel. And I... Well, it's just... It's Vala. She's quite a looker. It's more than that. I just can't stop myself with her. Why, hell, you've seen her. Isn't she worth the risk? Well, I wouldn't know. I just got to hold hands with her and now Bernie Ballantyne doesn't like me anymore. You got it all wrong, Turner. Bernie really wants to bury the hatchet. Yeah, right about here. No. I tried to put in a good word for you and, uh, he's... He's got a job for you. Quit ribbing. I'm not in the mood. Does, uh, this look like a rib? I asked him if I could bring it to you myself. [WHISTLING]CROMWELL: Hmm-mmm. Yeah, that's just the retainer. You'll get more. Plus expenses. Hey, pals again? Sure. Who does he want iced? Huh? Iced, cooled, rendered defunct. A whole lot of people have been killed for a whole lot less.Huh, yeah. Uh, you know, Bernie's available to discuss this job now if you'd like to see him. See him? For this kind of dough, I'd dance with him till dawn. Great. Now I'd better get back to the lot. Bernie's really got me hopping. Hey, you want a ride? No thanks, but I'll tail you over. DAN: It didn't really make sense that Bernie Ballantyne had suddenly forgiven me but I wasn't about to look a gift horse in the choppers. Maybe if business hadn't been so slow, I would've thought a little harder about the size of the check. He lost me about halfway to Culver City, but that was okay. I didn't need anybody to guide me to Bernie Ballantyne's private sanctum. Oh, hello there, Mr. Turner. Haven't seen you around for a spell. Yeah, and the last time you sent me away. Uh, you know I had to, Mr. Turner. Direct orders from...I know where they came from, Jesse. Get any new orders lately? You betcha. I'm supposed to send you right on through. Thanks, Jesse. It's good to be back. Nice to have you back, Sherlock. DAN: The Paravox bigwigs had a layout of offices in the main executive building just inside the entrance gates. Bernie Ballantyne was the biggest wig of all. He liked to keep an eye on everybody. He could do that just fine. His office took up most of the ground floor. [PHONE RINGING]Good morning, Mr. Turner. Hello, doll. Miss me? Sure, hon. Glad you're back. Me, I didn't mind keeping an eye on his secretaries. Ballantyne knew how to pick swell looking dames and it sure didn't hurt my feelings any to be seeing them again. Well, Doris, you're still doing the same amount of work, I see. [PHONE RINGING] [TYPEWRITER CLACKING] Well, Daisy, a girl could die of overexposure like that. [CRYING] VALA: Oh. Mr. Turner, isn't it? That's right. I haven't seen you since that little blind date Roy Cromwell set up. Please, don't talk about Roy and me. Bernie might hear. I guess that would be disaster, huh? You know it would. For Roy and for me as well. Then you shouldn't play with fire. Roy Cromwell's dynamite. Especially for a Jane who's someone else's property. Bernie doesn't know. And he won't, either, unless somebody tells him. But I feel sure that you're not the kind of man that would do such an ugly thing. Are you, Mr. Turner? Of course not. I knew you wouldn't. Unless it paid really big dividends. You lousy... DAN: Sometimes you forget, dames can take you seriously when you crack wise. I should've told her I didn't mean anything, but she ankled the room before I had a chance. Come in. Bernie was the meanest man in Hollywood. He had enough power to stay that way and make you like it. Have a seat, Mr. Turner. No thanks. I'll stand. [SCOFFS] You can't afford a grudge. And anyway, I always have reasons for what I do. What are they now? You want the job or not? I paid the paper not to run these pictures of the raid. You keep them as a reminder. I always get what I want, Turner. And I always keep it till I'm done with it. Thanks. I'll, uh, take these home and press them in my Bible. Pictures like that make me look bad. Do you understand? Well, I don't know. I've never been married. Yeah, well, Vala told me how you two just happened to meet at a dull party, how she talked you into taking her to the Limelight, et cetera, et cetera. Frankly, I don't care. Sure. You're really a very sentimental guy, aren't you? I need discretion. My image is tied up in Vala. I just saw her outside. She's crying. Yeah, well, that's why I wanted to hire you. Well, I'm all ears. I just found out Vala's taking large sums of money out of her bank account and I don't know why. I mean, I give her everything that she needs. As long as she plays by the rules. She's not keeping someone on the side, is she? Guess not. Well, when people act worried and draw big dough from the bank, it could spell shakedown, but you don't need any cheap flatfoot to tell you that. Anything in her past someone might've raked up? No. No, no, no. She's clean. Believe me, if she wasn't, I'd know it. I'll bet you would. Uh, she, uh, denied being in any kind of trouble at all. And she just ran out of here crying. Jeez, I hate it when she cries, you know. It--It causes wrinkles. Look, Turner, Vala's getting ready to go away tomorrow for a few weeks up north to shoot a new picture for us. I'll be there myself for a while, but, well, I'd like you to go, too, and keep an eye on things. See where the money's going. Did you get the check? Oh, yeah. I keep it right here next to my heart. Oh, good, 'cause there's a lot more where that came from. I'll pay you $500 a week plus unlimited expenses. What do you say? They got Scotch up north? Hmm? Scotch up north? I like that, Turner. Yeah, that's good. Scotch up north. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] DAN: By 9:00 that night, I was rolling north on the Silver Meteor, a couple bottles of VAT 69 in my valise just in case they didn't have Scotch. I'd asked Bernie Ballantyne for a jalopy and a rented apartment. Someplace where I wouldn't be noticed. I guess he got me just what I wanted. Bernie must've done the same for his snuggle bunny, Vala Duvalle. He'd rented her a swanky place in the snooty part of town. Sort of a garlic grower's Taj Mahal. I sat in my car and watched Vala's palace for a good five hours, but it didn't do anything suspicious. And just when I was ready to call it a night and grab some chow, Vala came out and climbed into a car about a half block long. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] The car started, slid by me, purring like a big cat. It was just possible she was meeting the blackmailer or dropping him some dough, so I figured I should earn my keep and follow her. But she pulled a fast one on me, and just went on to work. The amusement park was about to close for the season, but Paravox had leased the whole shebang just to shoot some action scenes and filled it with extras to make the place look busy. [PEOPLE CHEERING] [SCREAMING] Will you watch this for me?Oh, sure. All right, now, all right. Miss Duvalle is here. Let's rehearse. Well... DAN: Roy Cromwell was directing and I wondered if that's why Ballantyne wanted me there. Did he suspect Cromwell was grazing in his pasture? Now, Vala, here's the setup. Harvey's in a car up there. You're standing in line. You see him, you like him, you run to the front of the line just as his car takes off. Then, you jump in the car just behind his and it follows him. Simple. All right, all right! Let's do a run-through! Your marks. DAN: Cromwell had a rep for rehearsing every scene a dozen times before shooting a frame, so I figured I had time to wander around a little. All right, last time through if we get it right! All right, places. Now, ready? DAN: According to the screwy scenario, Vala was going to meet her leading man for the first time on one of the rides. Falling in love while descending an incline at 70 miles per hour. Personally, I thought the story smelled, but then I'm just a private snoop. Not a critic. There were extras all over the midway playing the sucker games with each other. There's a little kid in all of us just waiting to get out and if the free midway won't bring it out of you, maybe you're already dead. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] But one concession stand looked like a little more fun than all the others. The shooting gallery. The reason it interested me was the bleached blonde cutie who was taking the regular carny's place. I guess you could say me and Maizie were history, but the look she gave me at the Limelight sure wasn't old news. Okay, come on, everybody. Step right up. Let's go. Hit the Nazi and win a bear. Sorry, sweetheart. I'm fresh out of nickels. Oh, Dan. Talk about a big prize. What're you doing way out here in the sticks? Last time I heard, you were still the Hollywood detective. Well, this is a Hollywood movie, isn't it? Besides, I could ask you the same question. Oh, Cromwell promised me a week on this one, so it's worth a few days of driving up Route One. We've got a room in the Motor Court out on the highway. We? You mean that monkey you were with at the Limelight? Yeah, but he doesn't have his brand on me or anything. Maybe you and I could see about restarting that tingle? Why did we ever split up, Maizie? Somehow, I just can't seem to remember. I don't know. I never figured it out myself. You know, I've always carried a torch for you, Dan. Miss Murdock! We are trying to rehearse a crowd scene. We are not visiting with our old boyfriends! Sorry. Listen, I'll see you later, huh? You bet. CROMWELL: Hey, Turner, as long as you're here, how about filling in as an extra? You know, take a few shots, eh, hotshot? Why not? Great. It could open up a whole new career for you. Yeah. As a movie cowboy. All right, everybody, last time through! Are you ready, Miss Duvalle? Yes, Roy. All right, everybody, last time through if we get it right. Places! [SIGHING] Ready? And... Action! [PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] Cut! What do you think? It stinks. You're not giving me enough bang for my bucks. And I want some more leaves on the trees over there. Okay, okay, let me cut. All right, cut! All right, five minutes, everybody. Miss Duvalle to makeup, please. And be sure to get your nails touched up, darling. Dan. Will you just...When you get Vala in a shot, I want it to be the best.Bernie, I need more artistic freedom. You know what? You had more artistic freedom when you were selling women's shoes. I have no authority with the cast. Every time I do something...As a matter of fact, you did better selling women's shoes than you did directing pictures. Would you keep it down? Nobody knows I used to sell... Will you keep it down? Come on. Oh, what the hell is that now? What is it? What's going on? [PEOPLE CHATTERING] What's going on here now, Turner? Maizie's dead. She's been shot. Shot? Somebody's idea of a bad joke. Come on, sister, we're wasting time. Get up. Come on, sister, get... These guns are supposed to be loaded with blanks. Yeah, but this one wasn't. Where did it come from? It's mine. Bernie, what happened? Somebody said... VALA: Oh. Dan, why'd you do it? I didn't do it, Roy. You know I didn't.Of course not. [STAMMERING] Bernie, I know it looks bad, but Dan would never... Bernie, Bernie, I'm sure Mr. Turner couldn't possibly have done something like this.BERNIE: Hey, hey, hey, what is this? Somebody call the police. Help! All right, that's it. Everybody grow roots. Well, damn it, Dan. Everybody knew about you and Maizie. Old lovers' quarrel? Hold it! Police! Oh, good, Officers. This is Dan Turner. He's the killer. Drop it! Quick! Drop it, Turner. Get your hands up where I can see them. Sure, boys. I can explain this. You just shut up, Turner. Never mind your malarkey, just keep your hands real high. You're making a mistake, boys. Sounds like he's resisting arrest, Ned.Yeah. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] Hey. There he is. Let's go! Come on. DAN: You're in trouble, pal. The director said "action." OFFICER: Halt! You're under arrest! Where is he? Come on. Well, go on, go on. I'll wait here. I'll nab him when he comes down. Go on! Ride inspector. Ride inspector. Police! Stop! Stop! Stop! Turner! Police! You're under arrest! Swell ride, huh? I'm happy. You happy? Good. [CLEARING THROAT] [PEOPLE SCREAMING] [GROANS] [SCREAMING] First movie? Oh. My first, too. Good fun, huh? Pardon me. This is my stop. [GROANS] [GUN FIRING] All right, Turner. Stay right where you are and move toward me slow. OFFICER: Hey, I'm coming! Get up! Keep going! Halt! Police, halt! Will you get out of there? Come on! Go on! Go on! Come on, folks, follow me! Hey, hold it, mister! Where's your ticket? You can't get on without a ticket! NED: Go on!Would you shut up, Ned? Grove City police! Get out of the way! Look out! Get out of the way! Kid, I got to get on that ride. I know, but you need a ticket. Where's your ticket? You like cotton candy, kid?Yeah, I love it. Here. Have yourself a ball. Hey, mister, there ain't no ticket here. You can't get on without a ticket. Where's your ticket? Go on, hurry up. Go on! Where's your ticket? You need a ticket. I don't need a ticket. I'm the police. I don't care about your rules.There's no way I can... We got a man on there right now... BOY: Listen, I know that. Now, look, Officer... [SCREAMING]And another thing... Ned, would you put that thing away before you hurt someone. Listen, I want on the ride, I'm the law, and I want these rides stopped. Do you understand? Get him, boy, get him! He didn't have his ticket.Shut up! Good fun, huh? What do you wanna ride next? Get him! Get him! He's crazy. Get out of my way! Go on! Go on! I've been working three years and they both got on without their tickets...Will you shut up? You know, if you don't sit down, that little guy's gonna stop this thing and throw us both off. There he is.NED: Go on! There he is. I can see him. I can see him. The one without the ticket.Will you shut up? What happened? Where'd he go? He's gone. Where'd he go? Oh, well, he didn't have a ticket, anyway. BOY: Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey. You're gonna have to fill out a report. You actually got on that ride without a ticket. Ned, give me your gun. Oh, boy! Well, I hope you're satisfied. You lost him. DAN: So now I was on the lam. I couldn't go back and get my Hertz jalopy. And it was a big risk just going back to my rented digs, but it was a risk I had to take. I had to have a heater to replace the one I dropped back at the park. And a good shot of VAT 69 wouldn't hurt either. I figured it would take the cops a few more hours before the coin dropped and they came looking for me here. I was almost right about that last part. Welcome home, wise guy. Well, hello, Dave. Nice to see you. Make yourself right at home. What brings you up north? My vacation. I'm on a fishing trip. Well, there're damn few trout in here lately, Dave. You know me, Turner. I'm a curious guy. So naturally, when I hear my good pal is wanted for murder, I drop the rod and reel and motor into town to hear the details first hand. The cops here are glad to have a homicide detective working with them. How about a jolt? I'm on duty. Well, I won't rat on you. It'll be our little secret. By the way, I'll have mine straight. No mickey. That's not a bad idea. I wish I'd thought of it. So, why'd you do it? I didn't.Who did? I don't know. Yet. Was it your gun? Yep. But I didn't shoot it, at Maizie or anyone else. Then who did? You already asked me that once. I told you before. I don't know. Yet. You must have somebody in mind. Sure. I got three somebodies. Cromwell and Ballantyne... Yeah, uh-huh. They accuse you, so you accuse them. Clever. I've got good reasons. Who's the third somebody? I don't know. Yet. Cute. I like that. Cromwell jobbed me to stay around. He could've slipped around and gotten my gun, leaving me for the fall guy. Of course, nobody saw him do that, did they? And what about motive? Why would Paravox's top director want to kill a bit player? From what I understand, he barely knew her. [CHUCKLING] But you... Yeah, I know. And how about your other suspect? Ballantyne? Well, as far as I know, he had an opportunity, too. And he had good motive to frame me, he thought I was playing patty cake with his girl, Vala Duvalle. DAVE: Did you? I wish I had. Then I wouldn't mind taking this fall. [SIGHING] Interesting. That it? Yep. Okay, then. Let's go. You mean, you're gonna turn me over to the cops? I am a cop, remember?But Dave... Yeah, I know I'm a real heel. It runs in my family. I once pinched my own grandmother for robbing a blind man, so stick your flippers in these rippers and be quick about it. [GUN FIRING] [BABY CRYING] MAN: Hey, what's going on out there? [DOG BARKING] DAN: Whoever fired those shots was long gone. Somehow I wasn't surprised. About the only luck I'd had so far was that nobody had stolen my Scotch. Dave and I had been through plenty together. We'd had our differences, but I was fond of the big gazzbo. Besides, if he croaked, I'd probably be accused of creaming him. But maybe we both had caught a lucky break. It looked like the lead pill had only grazed his head which meant he wasn't dead. He was out cold for a while, but he was alive. Operator, get me the police. Police. DAN: Hello, this is Lieutenant Donaldson of the Los Angeles Police. Yes, sir? I've got Dan Turner, the gumshoe who's wanted for homicide. Well, that's good. Good news. Some of the boys are mighty peeved at him around here. That's what I figure. So, cancel the pickup order, I got a feeling he's gonna resist arrest all the way in. You poke him one for me, okay? I'll do that. So long. DAN: I figured that should keep the cops off my back for a while. But I still had to move fast. [KNOCK ON DOOR] [BABY CRYING] Mr. Turner? Yeah.Well, I hope you weren't asleep. [STAMMERING] It's Mr. Badger. I manage the apartments. Oh. Sure. Uh, what brings you out at this hour, Mr. Badger? A couple of my tenants just got me up a few minutes ago. They said they heard gunfire. Of course, it could've just have been a truck backfiring. [LAUGHING] You know how people are. I didn't hear a peep, chum. It's a nice quiet place you run here. Not like Hollywood, I bet.Oh. [BOTH LAUGHING] Exactly what do you do with the film, Mr. Turner? I don't believe you're an actor. At least, I've never seen you and I see a lot of pictures. Well... You must be a producer, right? That's right, I am. And you know what? There're filming a very exciting sequence over at the amusement park tonight. Really? Is Vala Duvalle in it? You bet. And from what I've seen, she's wearing a thin negligee that leaves very little to the imagination. Holy smoke!How'd you like to see that? Yes, I would. Certainly. Of course. It is rather late but I... This is the best time to see how movies are made. Now, you rush right down there and tell them the producer said you could watch. And they'll probably give you a chair right up front. About this close to Vala Duvalle. Thank you, Mr. Turner. Thank you so much. If there's ever anything I can do for you, just... [STAMMERING] It's Badger. [CHUCKLING] Just like the animal. [LAUGHING] Oh. Like the animal. That's a hot one, Mr. Badger. So long. [SIGHING] Operator. Get me the Limelight Club in Hollywood. ♪♪[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Hello? DAN: Pedro? Who is this? This is Dan Turner. I need some information, tout de suite. So? It's about Maizie Murdock. She was in your joint the night of the raid. She had some geek with her, pasty complexion, accused you of loading the bones. Roger Wilson, a small timer. I threw him out on his derriere. He a regular? No, he came in with the Murdock girl. She sort of likes him. He's a little gambler, okay? He loses his shirt, a very small shirt, and he goes home. What about Roy Cromwell? How often did he bring Vala Duvalle to your place? Two, three, maybe six times. [CHUCKLING] He's a real snake eye shooter. He couldn't make a point with a sharp pencil. Does he bet big? Oh, when he bets big, he bets big. When he loses, he loses his trousers. Lose many pair lately? A few more like him and I could sell this joint and retire in Acapulco. [LAUGHING] How about Vala Duvalle? She play the tables? A little. All right, she just comes here to be with him, I think. They use that private room a lot? Just once. That--That night you were here. Thanks, Pedro. That's a help. Au revoirand adios. No. Call me anytime I'm busy. Can you believe this guy? DAN: Now, I had something to sink my bridgework into. If Wilson saw the Duvalle chick going into that room with Roy Cromwell, it was a gilt-edged invitation to blackmail. That's all right, Dave. Don't get up. [DOOR OPENS] I wasn't any closer to cracking this job, but I had a big hunch where to look next. There was someone else I was looking for. A jealous little punk who'd been with Maizie the night of the raid. Whenever someone gets croaked, there's a motive. Find the motive and your job gets a whole lot easier. This time I was pretty sure if I found the blackmailer, I'd have the killer, too. You the hombre that called for the cab? That's me, sister. Well, I'm it. Hop in. Holy mackerel. DAN: Wait here, sweetheart. Oh, another damn copper. I might as well forget about getting any sleep tonight. [SIGHING] How come cops are always so ugly? Except you, maybe. I'm sorry, beautiful. We're just doing our job. No thanks. I'm on duty. Where did...Where did the little tart live? Right down there in room 39. With a fellow she said was her husband. [LAUGHING] Oh, sure. He's her husband. I'm Mae West. Thanks. I appreciate it. Hey, you got any more questions, my room's right here. Thanks, doll-face, but, but I got to get back to headquarters. So long. Well, so long. MAN: Hello, thank you. I keep playing like this, I get myself a new tie. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] MAN: Here we go, hello... MAN: Oh, my goodness. You know, this is a very... DAN: There were voices coming from inside Maizie's room. Loud ones. I didn't want to stumble into any cops, so I took a peek through the curtains. Oh, would you look at this? My goodness, you know, you get a whole new suit. One of the crap shooters was Roger Wilson, no surprise there, but what was he doing playing dice with Maizie barely cold? Raising money for her funeral? [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Oh, what do you want?Police. I'd like to ask you a few questions about your relationship with Maizie Murdock. You guys ever get tired? I'm so sick of cops. Maybe we're sick of you, too. At least we're trying to find out who cooled your chick. How many times do I got to say the same thing to you guys? How about one more? You know, I'm beginning to think you're gonna be uncooperative. I wonder how cooperative you'd be if I'd haul you downtown. Good choice. Now, let's talk about Maizie Murdock. We was gonna be married. Uh-huh. Don't I know you? I don't think so. I checked your record back in LA. You and Maizie were involved in a gambling raid back there a few weeks ago. I shoot craps once in a while. So what? So who else was there? Lots of people were there. All the swells go there. Yeah, you'd fit right in. Was Vala Duvalle there the night of the raid? I don't know. Maybe. Why? You know about the private rooms? [LAUGHING] Everybody knows about Pedro Criqui's private rooms, mister. You ever see Vala Duvalle going in or coming out of those rooms? What does this got to do with Maizie? I'm conducting a murder investigation, mister. Answer my questions. You see Vala going in or coming out of those rooms? No. DAN: You know, I hated to admit it, but I believed the little creep. He wasn't smart enough to playact this one. All right, Junior. That's it, I guess. Thanks for your help. And don't leave town. You ain't no copper. All this talk about the Limelight Club and now I remember where I saw you. Yeah, this is the Hollywood private dick. The radio station says this is the guy that killed Maizie. Sonny, you're buying yourself a whole lot of trouble. Yeah? Hey guys, come over here. You wanna try that on me? ROGER: Yeah, why don't we kill the son of a... We got him. Wilson, you call the coppers. Tell 'em... Tell 'em we got their killer. [SPITTING] But he's beat up real bad. [GROANING] [THUDDING] [MEN GRUNTING] Cops. I want cops. DAN: Come back here, you weasel. I told 'em to keep it down in there. [ALL GROANING] Get up. Get up. ROGER: Cops. I'll see you later, doll-face. ROGER: Hey!Oh, oh! ♪♪[COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] Well, you know where you wanna go yet? No. Just keep driving. I got some high-octane thinking to do. It's your money, mister. Say, I don't suppose you'd like to tune that into some Goodman or Basie. Who? You know, something that swings, or at least doesn't sound like hog calling. ♪♪[WESTERN SWING MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] Well, how's that? I don't know. What is it? Mister, that's Bob Wills, the king of western swing. Pardon my ignorance. Of course, Bob, he's out in Hollywood these days, making cowboy pictures. That's what I'd like to do. I can sing and ride and rodeo. Uh-huh. You know, I've been hoping one of those movie people would get in my cab. And now, here you are.Huh? Well, it ain't exactly as if I could help hearing the broadcast about you. They described you to a T, Mr. Turner. So, how come you aren't motoring me straight to the hoosegow? I ain't exactly a big fan of the cops around here. Can I take it then that you don't intend to blow the whistle on me? Nah, you seem like a nice enough guy. Besides, a girl's got to make a living. You know, you seem like the type that would treat a working girl right. And maybe even slip her a few extra bucks for that trip to Hollywood? That'd be right friendly of you. How's this? Hey, thanks, mister. Just keep driving and stay off the main street. And turn that radio down a notch. I need to do some thinking. DAN: I started thinking about what had happened since Maizie's murder. Some of it made sense, but I kept coming back to one thing. Who would kill Maizie? Why? [SIGHING] Hmm. I can just smell the rubber burning up here. How's that? You're thinking so hard, you're about ready to blow a hole through your hat. My daddy used to say, "If you're working so hard, you're doing something wrong." Well, what would your daddy say when things happened that didn't make sense? "Life ain't nothing but an accident waiting to happen." Your daddy seems like a smart man, angel. The name's Cindy Lou, mister. Well, thanks, Cindy Lou. DAN: An accident? Had somebody been trying for me all along? Instead of looking for Maizie's murderer, maybe I should've been looking for someone who wanted to make worm food out of me. We passed a carload of cops back there. I think they looked in when you lit that butt. [SIREN WAILING] Oh, sure as shooting. Here they come. [TIRES SCREECHING] You wanna race them? Do you think it'll do any good? It might. Let's see. Yahoo! They're gaining on us. Can't you goose this bucket anymore? [TIRES SCREECHING] Right along this time in the morning, the city's got a water truck that hoses down the streets. Oh. Well, how's that gonna help? Watch this. Look at her go. Whoops. Whoops, what? Yonder comes another. [TIRES SCREECHING] Hey, hey! You're under arrest. Hang on. [TIRES SCREECHING] [SHOUTING] Hey, would it be worth another ten bucks for them to hit the fireplug? Sure, but I don't know what you want with all this money. The way you drive, you're never gonna make it all the way to Hollywood. Watch this. Well, I'll be. How'd you know they'd do that? Just practice. I used to spin the tractor in the hog waller. [GROANING] Those boys probably needed a bath anyway. Now, where do you wanna go, Mr. Turner? To the hospital. The hospital? How come? For the nervous breakdown I'm having. You don't need the hospital, here's what you need. Go on, try it. You might even like it. [SNIFFING] Are you sure I'm supposed to drink this? [COUGHING] Yipes. Feeling better already? What is this? Garlic wine. My daddy made it hisself. Kind of grows on you, don't it? My gosh, I think you're right. I guess I owe you for this, too. No, that one's on the house. But you do owe me the 20 bucks on the fireplug. Ten. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hey, did you ever meet Gene Autry up in Hollywood? DAN: I was getting used to Cindy Lou's style of driving, but I couldn't stay in her cab all night. I put my gray cells back to work on the killing. If I'd been the intended target at the amusement park and then again at my rented igloo, then instead of solving Maizie's murder and the attempt on Donaldson, I only had to figure out who would want me croaked. You've gotten awful quiet. That garlic wine get to you? No, I was just thinking. Yeah?Uh-huh. About a guy who thought I got close to his sweetie and then paid me to keep an eye on her. Is this man stupid? No, doll. He's a very smart guy. Why do you ask? Because he sent the fox to guard the henhouse. Now, that doesn't sound exactly smart to me. So, maybe he had something else in mind. Sweetheart, you just said a mouthful. Keep that motor purring, doll. [DOORBELL RINGING] Yes? Miss Vala Duvalle, please. Miss Duvalle has long since retired. Well, you just trot her out of retirement. I wanna speak to her. Now, see here! When you say that you say "Now, see here, sir." How long has it been since you've had a good poke in the trumpet? Well, let go of me, you common thug, or I shall call the police. [GRUNTING] Jackson? Jackson? What's wrong? I heard noises. Oh. Hi, toots. Remember me? Of course, I remember you. Where's Ballantyne? Bernie's upstairs. Sorry, sister. You're lying through your teeth. If he was, he'd be down here by now. What do you want? Some answers. Let's have a few drinks, okay? I should call the police right now. Sure you should. Why don't you? Mr. Turner, it's late and I have an early call tomorrow. Why don't we stop fencing with each other? Why don't you tell me what you want? Right now, I'd just like to save my own neck. Well, I don't give a damn about your neck. Look, doll, about the blackmail. You bastard! Hey, take it easy. Or what? You'll shoot me? The goose that lays your golden egg? Get out! Get out, you bastard! You got your money. What more do you want? I'd like to earn it. And to do that, I've got to get you out of trouble. What're you talking about? What trouble? The trouble Bernie talked to you about in his office a few days ago. The trouble that had you leaving there in tears. The same trouble he hired me to investigate. You know, trouble. I... I didn't... I--I thought... Oh please, help me, Mr. Turner. I don't know who to turn to. JACKSON: [CLEARING THROAT] Miss Duvalle? Shall I call the... No, no, no. Everything's all right. Uh, I shouldn't need you anymore tonight, Jackson. Yes, ma'am. Mind if I help myself? Of course not. All right. Who's been blackmailing you? I really don't know. They send me letters telling me where to leave the money. Then if I fail, they-- they've threatened to tell about Roy and me. Look, you have to believe me. All right, kitten. Maybe I'm a sap. But I believe you. Oh, thank you, Mr. Turner. I've been so frightened, but now... Can you help me? Sure, I can. I've already eliminated every suspect except one. Roy Cromwell himself. That's crazy. Why would Roy need to blackmail anyone? Why, he's the highest paid director on the lot at Paravox. Besides, he'd never tell Bernie. That'd be cutting his own throat. That's the beauty of it. Who would ever suspect him? And as for the money, sure he makes big dough, but he blows it all on gambling. No, no. That's too vile. You're saying that he made love to me just so he could blackmail me? That's right. I'm sorry, kitten. You deserve better. No, it's not possible. It's unthinkable. Who else knew you'd be in Pedro's passion pit that one evening? Sure, it's Roy Cromwell. He squired you around, jockeyed you into position, and then sent you those blackmail notes. There's no way you'd ever suspect him. Why, that... You said it. And on top of that, he tried to pawn you off on me that night at Pedro's. And when those pictures came out, Bernie got plenty sore at me. I guess he still is. Bernie's not a forgiving man. If he thinks he owes you, he'll get you. Believe me. I found that out. Sure. That's why he tried to frame me for Maizie's murder. Thanks for the powwow. Where's Bernie now? He's, uh, he has a hotel room near the set. I'm quite sure he's not alone. He's never been faithful to me. Our marriage was just a matter of public relations to him. That's tough to figure. A gorgeous doll like you. Thank you. I'm glad you think so. I hope you don't think I'm... I think you're fine. Thank you, Dan. May I call you Dan? Angel, you kiss me like that again, you can call me Doris. DAN: Not many guys get a shot at a real live goddess. I wouldn't have been human if I was able to say no to Vala. And I'm as human as the next kink. But sooner or later, my mind had to get back to business. If Roy was the blackmailer, it made sense that he would try to kill me to keep me from finding out. Except I knew Roy and while he had a whole lot of faults, he was a damn good shot with a pistol. Miss me twice from close range? Not Roy. But who did that leave? Who wanted me dead that bad? Not just out of the way, but dead. I was beginning to think there was only one answer to that question. And I didn't much like it. I was pretty sure I had the whole thing solved now. But before I could be positive, I had to get everyone on deck for the big blow-off. [DIALING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Was I gone that long? Yes, sir, Mr. Turner. You surely were. You must've had an awful lot of questions. Well, I'm back now. With some answers. Uh-huh. With lipstick on your ear? Get in. You know how you make gunpowder? No. I buy mine ready-made. You pour in all the ingredients and you stir 'em up. Oh, you've been stirring up the ingredients, huh? Yep. And now I'm about to set a match to 'em. You think you can find me a telephone? We're practically there. A juke joint, huh? Good idea. It's a little past closing time, but I know there's a phone in here. ♪♪[CLARANCE HUMMING] [WATER SLOSHING] Hey, Clarance, okay to use your telephone? Sure, hon. Go right ahead. You know where it's at. Phone's over there. This shouldn't take long. ♪♪[HUMMING] Hello, is Roy Cromwell in? Of course, I know what time it is. I'm his producer, Bernie Ballantyne. Well, you tell him I'll be by a little later. And daddy loves this one, [RINGING]and I love this one, oh, and I love... I don't believe this. Get that for me. Will you, baby doll? And I love this one. Oh, and save that big one for me. Hello? Bernie? Turner here. Oh, Turner, you got a lot of guts calling me. Keep your shirt on, half-pint. I know who's been putting the squeeze on your girl. Vala? You know who's been blackmailing Vala? You bet. It's your hired hand, Roy Cromwell. He needed a wad of scratch for some gambling debts, so he got her in a compromising situation and tried to blackmail her for it. What? Don't worry. She's clean. But it looks real bad. Have you told this to anybody else? Not yet. And here's something else you can chew on. I know who got my gun back at the amusement park. Your gun? You mean... That's right. That's just what I mean. Goombye. Get me the police. DAN: I'd like to speak to Lieutenant Donaldson from Los Angeles. Is he around? You better believe it. He got a bandage on his head, makes him look like a swami. Hey, Lieutenant? It's for you. This is Lieutenant Donaldson. Hi, Dave. Guess who. Turner. Well, I'll be a... Sure, you probably already are one. Listen, Dave, I've cracked the Murdock killing. I need you but quick. Oh, yeah? I'd just love to see you, pal. I'd love to see you in a nice, warm cell. Cut the comedy, Dave. I got the killer. The same citizen who nicked your noggin. I'd love to stay and chat longer, but I'm on my way to Cromwell's. If you wanna be in on the finish, I suggest you meet me there. So long. OFFICER: He hung up before I could trace the call, Lieutenant. One more stop, doll. And that should wrap it up. Then let's ramble. [SIGHING] You'd better scram now, hon. Things could heat up around here in a big hurry. Okay, Mr. Turner. Well, look, if you're sure... I'm sure. Skedaddle on out of here and thanks, baby. I couldn't have done it without you. Been wanting to do that all night, Mr. Turner. Looks like every girl in town has gotten in ahead of me. Well, it was worth the wait. Maybe I'll see you out in Hollywood, huh? Kiss like that and you can count on it. Listen, when you get down to Hollywood, you give me a call. I'm in the book. I'll take you to the Brown Derby. Lash La Rue eats there. You make it a date, Mr. Turner. Goodbye. DAN: It wasn't too hard to find the little shanty that Paravox had rented for Roy Cromwell. It was almost as nice as Vala Duvalle's digs, but I didn't have much time to admire it. I had company. Well, hi there, Dave. DAVE: Put 'em where I can see 'em, Turner. Sure thing. You must've burned rubber getting over here. You guys made good time. Be careful how you handle that thing, chum. It could go off. So, this is what you shot me with. Oh, come on, Dave. You know that wasn't me. You're gonna stand out here and jaw at me all night or can we go indoors for the payoff? This is the payoff, smart guy. Slip the bracelets on him. Okay. But don't blame me when this case blows up in your kisser. The next kill will be your fault. What next kill? Right here in Cromwell's shanty. I've sicced the killer on him. And judging from the extra chariot in the driveway, Cromwell's got a visitor right now. I've done my part. It's your picnic now, Dave. All right. Come on, but the handcuffs stay on. Keep an eye out. If anyone else shows up, escort them inside. Let's go. Uh-uh. It doesn't pay to advertise. So how do you propose to get in, smart guy? Well, it's your collar, Dave, but if I were you, I'd try the doorknob. Turner, if this is some wild goose chase... Come on. CROMWELL: All right, all right, I admit it. I did it. But try to understand. I needed the money. Can't you understand that? I had to have the money. I was in debt to loan sharks. I'll make it up to you. I will. I'll get the money back. I swear I will. Just please, put that gun down! No! [GUN FIRING]No! This is the police! It's all over. [GRUNTING] DAVE: Get up. Slowly. You okay, Turner? Nothing's broken. VALA: You! Yeah. Me, kitten. Just in time to keep you from icing someone else. VALA: How did you know? The Raven Red. My nail polish? What's this, uh, nail polish malarkey? In a minute, Dave. You thought I was the blackmailer, didn't you? At least, at first. When I made that crack in Ballantyne's office, something about getting paid dividends for telling tales, you took it for real. You were already being bled by somebody. You figured it was me. Well, don't stop now. And the way I figure it is, when you came on location here and saw that I trailed you, you got plenty hot. Hot enough to cream me, only you missed. And got Maizie Murdock instead. No. I--I didn't. Sure you did. And then you came back to my place later and tried again. It's a good thing you're just a lousy shot. Depends on who you talk to, Sherlock. And that's about it. Except for the nail polish. I still don't understand. Raven Red. It's what made me tumble to the whole thing. It's hard to forget. And I've been wearing the same brand myself lately. You're wearing nail polish now, Turner? When I called on you a little while ago, I was hoping to get the goods on Bernie. At the time, I had him tabbed for the killer. But then I saw your nail polish on the dressing table. It's the same color as the nail polish that was on my gun when Maizie got shot. And you were just coming back from makeup with a fresh coat of powder, lipstick, and Raven Red nail polish. A perfect match. The company that makes it does special custom jobs for rich customers. It's a rare color. I bet they made this one especially for you, doll. Once I had that much, the rest was easy. I told you Cromwell was the blackmailer, although I wasn't quite sure it was true at the time. I figured you'd haul over here and try to cream him like you did me, only you missed and shot Maizie Murdock instead. I guess murder gets easier each time you try. I'm sorry, kitten. And I mean that. I could've gone for you in a big way, Dan. It would never work. You'd always be wondering how much I knew and what I was gonna do about it. And I'd always be waiting for you to try just one more time. OFFICER: I told you to stay out! BERNIE: I'll go anywhere I want! I rent this place. Hey, watch the coat! DAVE: Oh, let him go. What the hell's going on in here? Vala, honey, baby, honey. Oh, Bernie. What's wrong? Oh, honey, don't worry. What's wrong? Turner, what the hell's going on here? I'm sorry, Ballantyne, but your girl's headed for the slammer. What're you saying to me? Your fair-haired boy here was blackmailing her, and she couldn't take it. She thought I was the guilty party and tried to kill me. Only she missed and nailed Maizie Murdock. If you ask me, it's all Cromwell's fault. Dan, what're you saying? I thought we were pals. Yeah, I thought so, too. Cromwell, I don't know any of this what he's telling me, but I do know one thing. You don't work for Paravox anymore. Bernie, I can explain.And I'll tell you another thing. By the time I get through with you, you'll be lucky to get a job selling popcorn. [SCOFFING] Blackmail, my tuchus. [GROANING] [GASPING] I can't believe this. I just can't believe this. You know, I think he means it. [GASPING] DAN: He did mean it, too. The very next day, a new director took over the picture. Of course, it wasn't the same without Vala Duvalle. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] That night Dave Donaldson and I took a train back where we belong. Dave and I still didn't see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we both knew what to do when the drinks were on Bernie Ballantyne. Bernie had a lot of favors called in and the last I heard, Roy Cromwell was parking cars at a joint over on the strip. The Duvalle cutie, on the other hand, got lucky. Ballantyne got her the best lawyers his lettuce could buy and even though the gossip journals had her getting life, the jury only sent her away for 10 years on an involuntary manslaughter charge. Even if she served the whole 10 and a couple dozen more on top of it, I'd bet she'd still look great when she got out. Vala Duvalle, what a woman. Still, sometimes it's funny how things work out. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Well, now, I see Rufus has found his way home. I'm really kind of busy now, doll. All right, Dan Turner. None of your monkeyshines. No, ma'am. Look, why don't you put your jacket on? There's a table waiting at the Brown Derby with our name on it. Let 'em wait. DAN: Yes, sir. Sometimes it's funny how things work out.
