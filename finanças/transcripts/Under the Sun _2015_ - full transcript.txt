"One Heart United!" means national unity under one heart, which is a strong political foundation for building the best communist country in this world. We decided to instill this into the minds of the masses by strengthening consciousness and boosting the spirit of unity in their hearts. It is necessary to show the People's active will in building a strong and properous state for the sake of Kim Il-sung. It is a battle gloriously fought by Kim Il-sung's beloved army to protect the homeland's values, maintaining a noble conscience and eternal faith until the end of the word. Comrade Kim, we're starting now! Action! You're here before me again today. The morning light is so fine in our land of morning calm! Our country is so beautiful, where else in the world can you find such a beautiful land? Take your seats. In this lesson we will read a story about how the Respected Generalissimo Kim Il-sung chased away the Japanese aggressors and liberated our country. Open your textbooks. In his childhood, Great Leader Kim Il-sung hated the landowners and the Japanese aggressors. It was a hot summer day. The Respected Generalissimo and his comrades went to the top of Mangyongbong hill. The Respected Generalissimo said that the landowners wear Korean clothes and speak Korean, but they are traitors who have sold Korea to the Japanese aggressors. And then his comrades realized that the landowners are scoundrels who sold Korea to the Japanese aggressors. Respected Generalissimo Kim Il-sung refused to allow the landowners and the Japanese to enjoy their time out on their boat, so he picked up a boulder and hurled it down at them. While watching the boat fleeing, the Respected Generalissimo vowed: "Though they occupied our country today, they will not cheat us in the future. I will banish the Japanese from our land - all of them!" This is how Respected Generalissimo Kim Il-sung gave a lesson to the landowners and the Japanese. Put down your textbooks. So what did our Great Leader Kim Il-sung say while pointing at the landowners and the Japanese? Anyone? He said they are traitors. Right. Respected Generalissimo Kim Il-sung pointed at them and called them traitors. And then our Great Leader Kim Il-sung said to his comrades... What did he say? He said the landowners are traitors who sold Korea to the Japanese aggressors, though they wear Korean clothes and speak Korean. Right. So who are the Japanese and the landowners? Think about it... Who are they? Who are they? Yes? They made our lives unbearable and occupied our country by force. Right, take your seat. Write down the following: "Respected Generalissimo Kim Il-sung..." ...helped his comrades... ...his comrades... Yu-yong, sit up straight. Good. Write without mistakes. Students who sit up straight will have good handwriting. ...to realize that both... ...the Japanese and the landowners were scoundrels... ...the Japanese and the landowners were scoundrels... ...were scoundrels... Now let's read it together: Respected Generalissimo Kim Il-sung... Respected Generalissimo Kim Il-sung... -helped his comrades realize... -helped his comrades realize... ...that both... ...that both... ...the Japanese and the landowners... ...the Japanese and the landowners... ...were scoundrels. ...were scoundrels. He helped his comrades realize they were scoundrels. And what did they do after realizing they were scoundrels? -Taught them a lesson. -Right, they taught them a lesson. And what did the Great Leader himself do? Here on this picture we see Respected Leader and Generalissimo Kim Il-sung giving a lesson to the Japanese and the landowners on their boat. Who's the man who has picked up the biggest stone and is hurling it down? Everyone! Respected Leader and Generalissimo Kim Il-sung! Yes, Respected Leader and Generalissimo Kim Il-sung. Let's find it in our textbooks and read it out loud. Zin-mi. "Look here, although they occupied our country today, they will not cheat us in the future! I will banish these scoundrels from our land!" Right. Let's read it again attentively. Take your seat. Respected Generalissimo... Respected Generalissimo... ...rained stones down upon... ...rained stones down upon... ...the Japanese and the landowners having a good time on their boat. This shows how from early childhood Respected Generalissimo Kim Il-sung hated foreign aggressors... the Japanese and the landowners. Let's repeat what we learned today. What did the Respected Generalissimo call the landowners and the Japanese aggressors? What did he call them? Hye-yong! The Respected Generalissimo said that landowners and the Japanese are scoundrels who collaborated to make the lives of Koreans unbearable. Take your seat. Let's repeat it one more time. Zin-mi? Respected Leader and Generalissimo Kim Il-sung said to his comrades that the landowners and the Japanese made the lives of Koreans unbearable, that's why they're all scoundrels. Right. He said that they are all scoundrels. So what did he do to them? What did he do to them? Oh-gyong? He picked up a big stone and hurled it down at them. Yes, he picked up a big stone, hurled it down, and made it hail stones. The Respected Generalissimo will teach you to hate the Japanese and all our enemies, like he did in his childhood. Today, American scoundrels and their puppets want to destroy our socialist state. How do they say they are going to do it? -By conducting military drills. -Yes, by conducting military drills. Yes, they threaten us with military drills! But we have Respected Leader Kim Jong-un! And since we have Respected Leader Kim Jong-un, we will... -Win! Win! -Yes, we will win. My dear comrade students, we must firmly believe that we will win despite our enemies' best efforts. We must also learn from our Generalissimo to hate our enemies. You must hate the Japanese, the Americans, their puppets, and all our other enemies! In order to be ready to fight them you must be good students. What is a student's main objective? -To study hard. -That's right. Which holiday are we celebrating soon? The Day of the Shining Star. Yes, the happy Day of the Shining Star. Comrade students, this is the holiday you've all been waiting for: The happy Day of the Shining Star, the birthday of Respected Generalissimo Kim Jong-il. What is your main wish for that day? What do you want most of all? -Yes, Zin-mi? -To join the Children's Union. - To join the Children's Union? -Yes. - Take your seat. -Have some kimchi. -Okay. Zin-mi, you have to eat lots of kimchi. I will. You have to eat lots of kimchi. I will eat a lot. Zin-mi, kimchi is our traditional food. Yes... If you eat 100g of kimchi and drink 70 ml of kimchi brine per day... Yes... ...you'll get all essential vitamins. -Yes, and I know something else. -What else do you know? That it's good because it prevents aging and cancer. You read a lot, Zin-mi, that's why you know so many things. -Zin-mi. -What? -You have to eat lots of kimchi. -Okay. Zin-mi, kimchi is our traditional food. Action! -Zin-mi. -What? -Have some soup. -Okay. -Zin-mi. -What? -You have to eat lots of kimchi. -I will. -You have to eat more. -Okay. Zin-mi, kimchi is our traditional food. Yes... If you eat 100g of kimchi and drink 70ml of kimchi brine per day you'll get all essential vitamins. -Yes, I know. -What do you know? That it prevents aging and cancer, and that's why it's good. You read a lot, Zin-mi, that's why you know so many things. That's why you have to eat lots of kimchi... Eat faster. Don't act like you're acting in a movie. Just act naturally, like you do at home. No, no, leave it there. You'll bring it back. One more time. Okay. Good. Act naturally, like you do at home. Comrade Park, Zin-mi is sitting with straight legs. Why are you sitting so funny? Like that... Sit like that. It's great if you eat kimchi and drink kimchi brine. -It prevents aging... Right? -Cancer. Cancer, it prevents cancer. Then a big laugh. When a kid says something like that your face turns red like you're drunk. She's said a lot of good things and so both of you laugh. Understand? Then you should say loudly: "I know, I know!" You should say, "I know too!" Yes, it prevents aging and... what? It prevents cancer! Can you do that? Then you say, "Wow, how did you know that?" - laughing. That's how you should do it. "It slows down aging" is too long so I changed it to "it prevents aging." Sit down. -Sit down. -Have her say "aging." Say "aging." Participants, take your seats. -New members of the Union! -Yes! -Again! New members of the Union! -Yes! Teachers, move back! Teachers, stand in back! Stand at ease! Today, in a solemn atmosphere, all people and students across the country are celebrating joining the Children's Union on the birthday of Great Generalissimo Kim Jong-il! Today, on this happiest Day of the Shining Star, we remember the radiant figure of Great Generalissimo Kim Jong-il, who is always with us and who has sacrificed everything so that students will be happy and have a bright future! Great Generalissimo Kim Jong-il was an iron leader whose hundreds of battle victories made his enemies tremble with fear! But he was also a Loving Father who loved our children unceasingly! The world has no other Loving Father like our Great Generalissimo Kim Jong-il, who considered children the country's aristocrats and that giving children love was essential for both party and state. He sacrificed his entire life for the happiness of children! The new members are accepted into the Children's Union with love and solicitude for Respected Leader Kim Jong-un! Forward, march!

I swear! Stand at ease! Tie the knot of the Children's Union and congratulate the new members! -Congratulations! -Always ready! Get ready! Straight ahead! WHEN WE FIRST MET, LEE ZIN-MI TOLD US THAT HER FATHER WAS A PRINT JOURNALIST. THE KOREAN COMRADES DECIDED, HOWEVER TO MAKE HIM AN ENGINEER AT AN EXEMPLARY GARMENT FACTORY. Which details do you use here? 8mm details. 8mm details fit well. Say you'll make sure the details are installed on our machinery. Are there other kinds of details? Yes, there are also 20mm details. -20mm? -Yes, they also exist. -8mm and 20mm details? -Yes. Look at this here... If we examine our production quality, we can see that there are frequent equipment breakdowns, resulting in production waste. We should be ashamed of such production quality, shouldn't we? So, comrade engineer, can you help us deal with this problem? Yes. I noticed that too. Our workers are very skillful, but we lack 6, 8 and 20mm details. I'll make sure these details are installed on our machinery. If they are installed, it will raise our production quality. And if our workers perform in accordance with the new work quality standards, we'll be producing high-quality goods. Great! What do you think? We'll take the lead toward achieving this level of production. Excellent! Let's do it together. Yes, if we all work together there's nothing we can't do. -Let's try! -Yes! Overall we achieved a breakthrough. Comrade engineer, what do you think about that? Say "a great breakthrough" instead. -And you agree with her. -Right. "We have achieved a great breakthrough." We need more 8mm and 6mm details... No, don't say that. Just say, "From a technical point of view, if we do it we'll reach a better result." -Yes, that's right. -We'll join forces and work together. Yeah, say that. We'll all join forces to achieve this level of production. Yes, since there are junior workers... No, once again! Our factory... Don't say "our factory," say "our workshop." Our workshop has achieved a great breakthrough. ...has achieved a great breakthrough. "Look at this here..." Okay. We will greatly improve quality. -Yeah, say that. -Move now! ACCORDING TO LEE ZIN-MI, HER MOTHER WORKS AT A CAFETERIA, BUT DURING THE SHOOT SHE'LL BE WORKING AT AN EXEMPLARY SOY MILK FACTORY. Comrades! Everyone come here! Come on, everybody. Hurry up! Stand here and watch. Zin-mi's mother, here. Come quickly! Quickly! Zin-mi's mother, stand here. Stand here, please. Quickly. Stand here in a line. Facing the window. After everyone's lined up, you come out from there. Stand here. Get ready! Look at her and smile. "Our work is very important for our country and it makes us happy, so we must produce more soy milk." Say that first, and then: "Did everyone see the flower show? Did you see the pretty Kimjongilia grown by Zin-mi and her mother?" "Yes, we saw it." Say that joyfully. "It was really beautiful!" "It was!" Talk about the flower show, then say, "Zin-mi joined the Children's Union on the Day of the Shining Star. Let's congratulate her mother." That's the last phrase. It's the end. And after you say, "Let's congratulate her." Everybody say "Congratulations!" Try to do it well! Try not to think about the camera. Can you do that? Say what your work is for: It's all for our children, for our future... After that say, "Zin-mi joined the Children's Union." Say, "Let's congratulate her!" And "Congratulations!" Try to say more. Let's do it! Don't forget to smile. Smile! Everyone smile while your comrade is speaking. Comrades, both adults and children like our soy milk. That means we must produce more different kinds of milk for our country, working every day, right? And so we'll work harder to produce more milk! Comrades, Zin-mi and her mother grew a Kimjongilia for the flower show. Their flower bloomed so beautifully! It was the most beautiful Kimjongilia in the show! Did you see it? Yesterday, on the birthday of Kim Jong-il, -Zin-mi joined the Children's Union. -Let's congratulate her mother! -Congratulations! -Thank you, thank you! The soy milk we produce at our factory is praised by our citizens. Therefore, we shall join efforts in order to produce more different kinds of milk for future generations. So let's get to work! I want everybody to applaud. Then take your seats and listen closely to the war stories, like you're at the movies. And when the veteran speaks about an important event, you should applaud loudly. Understand? Action! Applaud loudly. Listen carefully. The veteran is coming soon, so get ready! During the war in the 1950s, as you already know from the movies, the Americans wanted to conquer our country and they waged war against us. Comrades, today our workshop beat the government quota with 150%! Everybody worked well, and our eldest and most experienced worker contributed greatly to our success. Let's give her a round of applause! Congratulations! Thank you! What now? Should I say something? I think the success that we've achieved is not only my success, but the result of work performed by everybody here. Also it was our engineer who made these results possible. We achieved these results due to his invaluable guidance on using the machinery. I'd also like to congratulate him on his daughter's joining the Children's Union on the Day of the Shining Star. Let's congratulate him! That was good. Let's try it one more time. Listen! -Let's do it with joy. Understand? -Yes. -I can't hear you! Did you understand? - Yes. -One more time. Understand? -Yes. Yes, yes, yes... One more time! Loudly and joyfully! Look at your comrades when they speak. Look at them and after they finish, say loudly: "Congratulations!" When she congratulates the engineer on his daughter, Everybody stand up and loudly say "Congratulations!" -Can you do that? - Yes. -I won't say it again. Comrades! Today our workshop achieved 200% of the government quota! Everybody worked very well, especially our eldest and most experienced worker, who contributed greatly to our success. Let's give her a round of applause! Congratulations! One more time, one more time! Everything was good, but everyone should look at her when she speaks, including Zin-mi's father. Everybody was looking at her except him. Why is your applause so weak? Let's do it like this, smiling! Comrades! Today our workshop achieved 200% of the government quota! Everybody worked very well, especially our oldest and most experienced worker, who contributed greatly to our success. Let's give her a round of applause! Congratulations! I think we achieved such success due to our mutual efforts. Our comrade engineer especially helped us on the technical side of things, and it is due to him that we achieved this level of success. In addition, his daughter joined the Children's Union on the Day of the Shining Star. Let's congratulate him! -Congratulations! -Thank you! We cheered, "Hurrah for Kim Il Sung! Hurrah for Generalissimo Kim Il Sung!" And the second military unit even forgot to shoot at the planes because they were also shouting hurrah. Usually four to six planes were enough to destroy everything, but not even 32 planes could beat us that time! How could it happen? Because all Americans are cowards. They are cowards. Why are they cowards? Americans are not like us. They are not like us. They think only of surviving and returning home to their country. So when they saw the first plane crash and burn, their eyes widened with fear. Now let me tell you about shooting at the American planes. Back then we didn't have enough planes and artillery cannons. Our enemies knew that and sent a lot of planes to destroy our airfields. They bombed and destroyed all our cities, including Pyongyang. They even bombed and burnt small villages in the mountains. They even hunted down and burnt children going to school. They fired at their parents working in the fields. You can see how much they were shooting... from the numbers of graves in the mountains... The graves of dead people... The gravestone tells you the name of the person buried there. They fired at those too, thinking they were people... That's how the Americans even hunted down and burnt children. They were crazy, firing indiscriminately at whatever - people or stones. At such a moment our People's Army couldn't think of keeping up resistance to the Americans. When those planes were bombing our country, we could only think of how to hide and save our lives. And then our Leader began fighting to oust the Americans from our country using a rifle... Do you know what a rifle is? A rifle is used with a bayonet. You've seen it in the movies. There's also an automatic rifle with a round magazine on the right. An automatic rifle... You watch a lot of movies, right? There are also heavy machine guns that you can put on wheels, and the barrel is cooled with water. -Can you imagine it? - Yes. -A heavy machine gun. So we were machine-gunning American planes. Nobody in the world had done it before, but our Leader taught us to take down aircraft with this gun. We saw how good and effective it was in practice at shooting down the planes. Well, I told you only one story and it took me 40 minutes. We fought against a lot of planes but there isn't enough time so I told you only about the planes that crashed. I didn't tell you about the planes that kept on coming back. I told you the story about how we shot at American planes in the 20th century and I'll stop my story here. Our gunnery unit was highly praised... What should I say now? About the students who joined the Children's Union. -Afterward? -Yes, tell your story, then mention the students who've joined the Children's Union. Say that, please. Tell your story, then say that... So, I told you... a story about how we fired at American planes. But we didn't deserve the credit for shooting so well. All the credit goes to the Great Leader, the one who taught us how to do it. Although the Great Leader was very busy with the battlefront where he was shooting down American planes, he also cared about those in the rear. Therefore, he formed and deployed air defense units and taught us how to shoot down aircraft. At the beginning, those rascals attacked by daylight. They flew during the day, firing on everything they saw, even children. But then they began to attack only from a height of 200-300 meters and only in areas where there was no air defense system... Excuse me, finish your story and please congratulate the kids on joining the Children's Union. Congratulate the schoolchildren who joined the Children's Union. Finish your story then please say that. -Afterward? -Exactly. Today I want to congratulate the schoolchildren who have now joined the Children's Union on the Great Leader's birthday! He's the driving force behind Korea, In his embrace he holds the People's fate. He will fulfill All our hopes and dreams. We know nobody but you, Great Comrade Kim Jong-un! Great Comrade Kim Jong-un, We will follow only you! Action! -Hello. -Hello. These schoolgirls recently joined the Children's Union. They wanted to watch the lesson, can they? -What're your names? -Lee Zin-mi. Lim Soo-yong. -Choi Song-min. -You're all so cute! -You can sit there and watch. -Okay. -Sit here and watch. I'll be back. -Okay. Okay, one more time! We have now learned arm movements. Since we've already learned to pli?, if you do arm movements well we can learn to do them together with pli?s. Generalissimo Kim Il-sung said that Korean dance is very refined, energetic, and elegant. So if you also move smoothly, with elegance, focusing on your breathing, you'll preserve the special delicate... flavor of Korean dance. When the instructor says "one" the right hand goes up. On the count of "two" the left hand goes up. Again! Stand at ease! Attention! Get ready! Get ready! One! OUR HEROINE, OF COURSE, GOES TO THE BEST SCHOOL IN THE KOREAN CAPITAL. WE'VE NEVER SEEN CHILDREN GOING IN OR OUT OF SCHOOL, EXCEPT ONCE WHEN SCRIPT DEMANDED IT. CHILDREN PROBABLY LIVE AT SCHOOL. THE SAME GOES FOR THE FACTORIES WHERE WE FILMED LEE ZIN-MI'S PARENTS AT WORK. WORKERS LIVE IN BARRACKS RIGHT IN THE FACTORY GROUNDS.

Every year, with the beginning of April, our flower bud hearts are filled with grief for our Respected Generalissimo Kim Il-sung! Great Leader Kim Il-sung loved the children of our country his whole life. He planted a garden at his home at Mangyongbong and he also built our palace. One spring day, when construction of the palace was completed, he was so happy he began singing, "Do not be envious of anyone." It seems like he's just about to enter our palace, at least for a moment, as he did on that spring day, smiling radiantly. We wait for him here every day with songs, dances, and flowers! Let's sing of the Day of the Sun with Respected Leader Kim Jong-un! Let's lift up! Let's lift up! Let' lift up even higher our Leader Kim Jong-un!

Zin-mi, what do you expect of life since joining the Children's Union? When we join the Children's Union, we enter adulthood. Now you feel responsible for your mistakes. And you wonder what else you should do for the Respected Leader... Calm her down, tell her everything will be all right. Stop her crying. Don't cry. Try to think of something good. What? Something good. I don't know what. Think of something good or funny that happened to you in the past. Get her to say something cheerful. Do you know a cheerful poem? To recite? Founded by Great Leader Kim Il-sung, kindled by Great Brilliant Commander Kim Jong-il, and led by Respected Leader Kim Jong-un, I join the glorious Children's Union and swear, always and everywhere, to think and act in the spirit of the Great Generalissimos and the teachings of Respected Leader Kim Jong-un, in order to become a reliable reservist of the revolutionary Juche movement for the building of Communism, continuing from generation to generation. I swear!
