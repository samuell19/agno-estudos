Seven days, eight boxes of film, a 16mm camera, two partners, a few friends and places, one or two ideas, no scenario. That's all I had, as well as the pressing desire to shoot in Roma just before I had to leave, to direct what was already appearing as "notes for a film to come" and that the title implies : By then. There would be a thousand reasons to keep this work of youth shot under barely digested influences in a state of almost full somnambulism and unconsciousness. Putting aside a few sequences, almost nothing, in cinematic writing, is worth saving. If I decide to show this movie today (in a digital reduction), it's on one hand to the new interest that it can show regarding the following movies and that it was preparing unknowingly: Nocturnes pour Le roi de Rome and Le chant des séparés, shot on the same location ten years later. On the other hand, and mostly, because it seems to me that its writing's faults don't completely obscure the intents that guided its realization: testify of a tragic vision of life indivisible from a love of reality perceived as deeply mysterious, unfathomable, miraculous. Will have been Chance's castle Room 2 this movie, that tell some facts that happened in Roma from July 6th to 13th 1995 during which lot of being disappeared, will start soon undated facts By then By then this movie, that tell some facts that happened in Roma from July 6th to 13th 1995 By then the earth was hurly and burly a darkness on the faces of the abyss its breath on the faces of the waters sound he said: "a light shall be" and it's a light he sees light: what a pleasure! he separates light from darkness and it's an evening, and it's a morning: day one he says: "a ceiling will be at the middle of the waters to separate between the waters and between the waters" he makes the ceiling he separates the water under the ceiling from the waters on the ceiling and it's an evening, and it's a morning: day second he screams to the dry: "earth" to the alignment of waters : "seas" he sees: what a pleasure! and it's an evening, and it's a morning: day third he says: "chandeliers will be at the ceiling of the skies, to separate the day from the night" "they are for signs, appointments, days and years" light these are chandeliers at the ceiling of the skies to illuminate on earth and that's how he sees: what a pleasure! and it's an evening, and it's a morning: day fourth day fifth he creates Adam the clayish in his replica he shapes the clayish Adam, clay's dust he builds the rib, that he took from the clayish man, into woman he sees everything that he had done and here: an intense pleasure and it's an evening, and it's a morning: day sixth so 1,249,689,000 seconds So, well, being born the first of December 1955 at 11:55 AM which is which is exactly 39 years, 7 months and 6 days So with 12 months a year it's 475 months and 6 days if you don't count the extra month's bonus so, when you multiply it by 365, we got exactly 14,464 days which give us 347,186 hours so 20,828,160 minutes so 1,249,689,600 seconds, approximately Yeah, that's it approximately.

At what time? Not before noon? No it isn't good then. After noon? No, can't do. From the 14th? It's too far away. I'll call you back and we'll see. Where mom? Eat at least half of it. I don't want to hear "I'm hungry" later. OK? You haven't eaten anything. Here, around the table it's "too much". Well? That's it? Stop. Hello grandma Are you feeling better?

You're 77 years old. A little bit more. ...starting on Fiano's square in Roma. That's all. Back to our program. And now, for economy: Tax authorities are still having a good time. After the numbers on local taxes that went to a new record in early 95, other good news have come, regarding tax evasion and may's self-tax. That was Francesco di Mario. The 740 doesn't disappoint, according to almost definitive numbers, the minister of finance Fantozzi stated during a convention in Turin that self-liquidation went very well, exceeding by 1500 billions the forecast He then talked about yesterday's numbers, about tax' income from january to april Fantozi said that the fight against tax evasion Hello grandma Yes, I'm fine. I'm going to read my... to you a passage, from chapters 1 & 2 The most primitive representation that we have is that the earth never had a start. No child has any reason to wonder since when does the earth exist. Since it's on it that every change happens. If what we call Earth was really born some day which is hard enough to grasp we naturally admit that this beginning happened in inconceivable remote times Yes, I'm fine. I'll call you back. February 11th 1920 February 11th 1920 Paul Claudel wrote Arrival of my wife. We watch them be born, live accomplish their humble duties then disappear, hundreds of billions, without leaving any traces without anyone being worried without them achieving anything else than death We watch them be born, live accomplish their humble duties then disappear, hundreds of billions, without leaving any traces Hello grandma It's me again. It's 9:20 I'll read to you another passage before you leave I've lived full weeks in this room My memory, in this, doesn't deceive me I know that during the last month, I took a bath every day. What do I remember? Each day, the bath and each morning? No. I know that I took a bath every day. But I don't hold this knowledge from my immediate memory. I say The same day, sadly During a stroll, the king of the elephants ate a bad mushroom OK, love. Poisoned, he was very ill. So ill, that he died. That's a great misfortune. After the funeral the oldest elephants have gathered to choose a new king. At this same moment, they hear some noise and turn around What do they see? Babar coming in his car and all the elephants are running and screaming 'here they are, they're back!' Hello Babar, hello Arthur, hello Celeste What a beautiful suit! What a beautiful car! So, Cornelius the oldest of the elephants, says, with his flickering voice My good friends, we're looking for a king why shouldn't we choose Babar? He's back from the city, he learned a lot from men. Let us give the crown to him! All the elephants think that Cornelius spoke very well. they're waiting for Babar's answer. Thanks to all of you he said but before I accept I have to tell you that, during our car trip Celeste and I got engaged if I am your king, she'll be your queen. Long live queen Celeste! Long live king Babar! said all the elephants without a blink. And that's how Babar became King! Let's get out. We return now... No? No. You go ahead. We return now... No? No. You go ahead. Come forward French? France is going through a hard time -Why? -Firstly, because of the nuclear. Secondly, because of road accidents, 20 persons died the day before yesterday 18...20 people. A bus went... No, 20...30 people died, students, including spanish, french and belgian. A bus went off the road. Then a big truck went in the wrong side of the road, another 4 deaths. Then what happened? Something else happened. Another road accidents, other 3 deaths. So, it's a tough time. Anyway, Chirac is not good. No, not for nothing, but he's not good. The nuclear, that's enough. It was sufficient Chernobyl, Russia. You know, here... And they were over there. So the nuclear now... no more - Should we remove the supports? It's a very very big painting. This That goes up, very high. And there you see stuff, movies, cartoons. And there's music sometimes And if you put the music like this It's good It's very good like that! It means that it's further north than there. Here it's for kids, here it's for adult who already knows the music Music Well, music is... music is art. Music is Music is it's when you play the violin. Music is singing, sound, mostly voice, like this We watch them be born, live accomplish their humble duties then disappear, hundreds of billions, without leaving any traces without anyone being worried without them achieving anything else than death I see some leafs and a tissue. I see trees. I see some ants, they're moving. I see the tiles of the patio. I see 11th July 1929, Paul Claudel writes: Mom died on the 19th of July at 8PM. 14th April 1931, Paul Claudel writes: Revolution in Spain. End of Alfonso 13 and of the Bourbon. Spring, magnolias. The 11th of July, is that what you told me we were today? Where are the french nuclear explosions? Was that today? Or yesterday? Or tomorrow? How many of them will they be? 11th of July doesn't matter, could have been beyond the 14th And that's it. What do you want me to say? By the way, Chirac agrees with Clinton because Clinton announced three days after Chirac that they needed nuclear tests too. because all the previous nuclear tests were useless because all that stuff was too old. The world, it's big. We're not alone! There's not only Italy. It's not that the earth is a boot. The earth is like a boot, it exist, but it's round. With lots of countries. But the earth is in space. in space. almost the whole universe. The earth is in space. Day sixth
