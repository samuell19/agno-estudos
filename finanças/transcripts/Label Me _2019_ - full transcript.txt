- Do you like my place? - What do you want? - I wanna fuck you. - No. - Why? - Because I say so. So, you cantell yourself you're straight? - Okay listen, here are the rules. I fuck you as long as you can take it. You come. I get my money. I leave. - What if I don't give you the money? Shouldn't you take that first? - Man, don't try me. Fuck you! No kissing! Okay? - Okay. You fuck me. - It's enough. - Your money's on the counter. - You don't want to go next? - Huh, that's all. I don't care. Where are you from? When did you come here? How much do you make? Enough. - Okay, let's play a game. For each question you answer me, I pay you 10. - 50. - 20. Where are you from? - You want to pay me 20 for this? Fine. Aleppo. - When did you come here? - One and a half years ago. - Do you speak German? - No. - What did you do back home? - Study. - What? - Well that's another question. Music. - Did you first have sex with a woman or a man? - Woman. And when was the first time you had sex with a man? - When was the first time you had sex with a man? - When I was 15. It was a boy from my class. We used to hang out after school. My parents were never home until 6:00 p.m. so we always went to my place, listened to music, watched TV. Started with just us touching, not more. At first I thought it was a one-time thing. Then we kissed, rubbed our dicks. He gave me a blow job. Then one afternoon, I took out lube that I stole from my older brother and he fucked me. It hurt. At the same time, I never felt so good. And after that, he never came over again. (speaking a foreign language) (speaking a foreign language) (intercom sounding in a foreign language) Keep going. Fuck. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I've got to go. - Hey. - What? Uh, it's the blue one, right? - Man, I don't care. Give me my money and I'm gone. - How about you wait until I come back and then you earn it? - Deal. - Deal. See you. Sorry, it took longer. Uh huh. I see you found my pizza? Mm, boy. What's this? - Thought about stealing it. - Ah. Okay. - But you're lucky. It takes me more effort to sell it than fucking you. - Hm. I can understand the MacBook and the headphones, but my jock? Okay. Anything else? - Found this. You looking for this one? I like this. Who is that guy? - Put it on. - What? - I said put it on. - Are you serious? Why should I do this? - Because I pay you. - Are you happy now? - Shirt. Turn around. Spread your legs. Spread your cheeks a little bit. - You won't fuck me. - Then jerk me off. - You owe me for tonight. You know what? Fuck off. I'll take it the next time. - For a straight guy, you hang out at a lot of gay places. - They pay me. - Mm, I can see that (German) Did you ever go inside? - No. - Do you want to? - No. - Would you do it if I pay you? - I don't care where you want to get fucked. - Good. Follow me inconspicuously (German) Come on, follow me. - That's not for me. - Strange, but once you overcome that, it's fine. - I don't need to go in there again. - What's your name? - Do I get another 20 for this question? Waseem. - Lars. - Hi. - Hey. - What? - Nothing, it's funny. You would think someone who made it all the way here should be able to make it through a gay sauna. - You know what? I wasn't even afraid when I got in the boat. I mean there's nothing you can do about it anyways. If you sink, you sink. - So what are you afraid of? Sometimes I'm afraid of being alone. Thoughts can be pretty loud if you're all by yourself. - Everything. Yeah, everything is scary. - Mm. If you sink, you sink. Come on, let's go. I'll drive you home. - No thank you, it's fine. I'll take the train. - Train? You want to wait three hours? Come on, let's go, I'll drive you home. Come on. - Why do clocks look like this when everything is digital? - You see the clock? It's quarter to 10:00. That's not the right time. It's also broken. That's what I mean. It's digital, everything is digital, but nothing works. I don't know how to do it. Maybe you know how to do this? Do you have this in your car in Syria? - You don't want to drive a Syrian car. - A what? What kind of car? - A car from Syria. - Do you have cars in Syria? No, we still ride with fucking donkeys. Yeah, I thought so. Or with the flying carpets. - Ah, okay, nice, magic stuff. You have a license? - Kind of. What does that mean, kind of? Do you have a license or not? - Yes. I gave myself a license. You gave yourself a license? - Yeah. - Okay. It's here. - See you tomorrow. - Are you okay? - Yep. - Are you sleeping? No. - Hang on, I got something for you. Take a look at this one. - Is this shit on his head? - Yeah, he's a shit head. It's called "the little mole who wanted to know ... (German) The little mole who wanted to know who shit on his head. - Why would I like a book about shit? Because it's funny. - But it's about shit. - Yeah, yeah, technically, yes. Go for it, it will cheer you up. - What's wrong with you people? I don't get it. - That's very mean. Who shit on my head? But he, you know, the mole, he's nearly blind, so. Who shat on my head, he asked the dove. (German) "Did you shit on my head," he asked the dove. "Me, no, why? "I, I do it that way." She answers. It's my favorite book from childhood. - Yeah, nice childhood. - Yeah, absolutely. - What else did you read about? Pissing donkeys? - Come on, pissing donkeys, I'm sure your childhood was full of those. - All right, you are fuckin' racist. Come on, racist? - Yes, you are. No I'm not, I'm not a racist. - You just look like a racist. Ah, that's a clich√©, because I'm blond and I have blue eyes? Come on. - Thank you. - For what? - I know what you're thinking. - You do? No kissing. - Mmhmm. What's wrong with you? You faggot. You're a faggot. What? - Dick sucking faggot. You are a faggot. I don't give a fuck about you, you know that? Okay calm down. - Oh fuck you, fuck you. - Hey, calm down. - Fuck you, you faggot! You're a fucking dick sucker. You are a faggot ass. - Hey. Calm down. - You're a fucking gay dick sucker, you dick sucker! I don't give a fuck about your fucking ass. - Here, or? - Yeah, yeah. - It's okay. Sorry. - Ah, fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! - Is there a problem? - Condoms. Of course. - Waseem! Waseem! Wait. Waseem. Can we talk? Please? Sorry.
