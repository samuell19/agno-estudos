- Happy Tuesday. It is... - It's not Tuesday. - It's not Tuesday? - Isn't it Monday? It is Monday. It is! Happy Monday. Hey, everybody, michael symon here. This is our first day of daily dinners. Michael: This past spring, I poured my passion for cooking Into something pretty simple. Look at that. - Oh, yeah. - Every night I made dinner live On food network kitchens' facebook page... - Norman just got a little bacon. - Norman got it. Michael: ...And millions of people watched and cooked along. - Liv's making her debut. - Hello, world. Michael: My friend liv filmed and took questions from everyone watching Liv: Anna's wondering if she could use greek yogurt In case of sour cream. Michael: Sure, it'd be greek perogi, but delicious. Liv: Could you shred the sweet potatoes in a food processor If you don't have the grater? - Of course. And it would make it even easier for you. Pauper dell, we did pretty good. Michael: Now that the weather's warmed up. I'm taking symon dinners outdoors to show you That anything you can make inside of the kitchen... - Look at that. - ...You could also make outside. - Oh, my god. - My wife, lizzie, Is helping me cook... You're the highlight of the show. ...And liv is back filming us... - Hey, guys - ...And joining in the fun. Michael: So we start mixing that in the sauce. - Will this be thick enough? - As I make Some of my favorite simple comfort foods, all outside. Oh, my gosh, that looks fantastic. ♪♪ Today is all about the no-look cook. Now, what is the no-look cook mean? We're going to cook in foil packets Right on the charcoal. It's going to be delicious. We're going to start off with a bundle of clams, Sausage, peppers, delightful, and then grilled peaches With a touch of butter and mascarpone whipped cream. And then liz is going to make a sangria with rosé That is going to knock your socks off. So I have some bell peppers here. I have orange, yellow, and red, But any bell peppers will work just fine. I'm going to slice these up relatively thin, Like, you know, like the french say julienne. I always find it easier if you cut the pepper like this, It's harder to cut. If you put the interior up, I always find it's easier to work the knife through it. The other things that I'm going to add to this Is I'm going to add about four cloves of garlic And I'm going to add one red onion, Which I'm just going to slice. In addition to that, we have clams And I'm using middle neck clams and also any kind of sausage. I'm using a smoked sausage, but you could use spicy italian, But you want a kind of a sausage that's already been cooked, Whether it's cured like a salami or smoked like a kielbasa, That's what you're looking for. Liz: And do they have to be middle neck clams? What's the difference between clams? The difference between clams is mainly size. So there's little necks, which are smaller; Middle necks, which are middle. I like a middle neck clam for this Because they're just a little meatier. They take a little bit longer to cook, Which gives the onions and the peppers And the sausage time to kind of catch up with them. The beautiful thing about cooking in a packet Or you know, the french would say "en papillote" Is that you put all these different flavors in the packet And then they cook together. When the clams open, They're going to throw their juice into the sauce. When the sausage renders out some fat, It's going to go into the sauce. This is like a marriage of flavors. The thing that I love about these packets Is you could build Individual packets for individual guests like, Say you had a guest that, you know, doesn't eat meat, You could leave meat out of theirs. Or a guest that wanted them spicy. So you could almost make it like a party, Like cut a bunch of vegetables, Cut a bunch of meat. - It's a new kind of party... Build your own packet. - Build your own packet. If we were doing these in the oven, We would set our oven to about 375, 400 degrees, Put the packets in the oven on a sheet tray. I'm going to do, I think, Two or three big packets, build our packets. So I'm going to take two pieces of foil And I'm going to make an x like this. I'm going to take half my peppers, A little bit of my garlic, some onion. Olivia shopped for those red peppers this morning. Good job. Liv: Yes, I did. [ laughs ] a pinch of salt, cracked black pepper. Some sausage... Put our clams right on top. I like putting the peppers and onions on the bottom Because that's going to go directly on the flame. They're going to caramelize and then the meat and the clams Are going to release their juices down in it. So now I start to kind of crimp up my sides And put in a little bit of my butter, splash of my wine And we crimped up the sides so the liquid doesn't pour out. Obviously. Do you have to use wine in this? I do want some acidity in there. So you could use lemon juice And a splash of water would work fine or lemon juice And a little bit of stock would work fine, too. I have chicken stock, but any stock will do. And then we're going to come up all the way here. Seal everything up, so we got our first bundle done. Now the second package is exactly the same unless, You know, you wanted to do something a little bit different And you could do that, too. Like if you wanted to eliminate the meat, You could eliminate the meat. So we're going to take the rest of our onions, peppers, garlic, Most of our sausage, put our clams right on top, do salt... Cracked black pepper... ...In our little well there formed. Stock, wine, and then we bundle up this guy. Make sure everything's sealed because you want the steam To form in there to cook everything. Now I'm just going to set them right on those hot coals. - Oh, wow. Right in there. - Right in there. Michael: The other one goes in right next to it. Right in the coals. So now, I could put this top on and I'm still getting heat And I'm going to make my rice pilaf on top As the clams are cooking underneath. Liz: Why are you zesting the lemon? What does that bring to the dish? So there's more flavor in the zest of the lemon Than there actually is in the juice. So one, why waste it? Two, the zest has so much pop in it, So this is a little crispy squash blossom. To finish it with just a little bit of lemon zest Is going to just put it over the top. These little bundles of joy are in there cooking away. Now I'm going to start my pilaf. I got my pan on the stove getting hot already. I'm then going to put in about a tablespoon or two of olive oil And a little bit of butter. I go equal parts butter and olive oil for my pilaf. Uh-oh, come here, butter. Oh, butter on a warm day. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. See, this is the real skill test. Oh, boom. [ laughter ] Liv: And I just have to ask, since these are wrapped, How do we know when they're done? They're going to go for about 8 to 10 minutes. At 8 to 10 minutes, I'm going to pull them out. You could kind of peek in there to see If the clams are starting to open. If they're not open, You could leave them in there for a little bit, But the beautiful thing about these is they'll stay hot, Ready to serve for about a half hour after that. So it's a great way to entertain because you don't have to Pull it out of the stove or off the grill And serve it right away. So my butter and oil are starting to froth. To that, I am going to add my onion that we diced off... One medium yellow onion that's going to go in And then we're going to start adding our aromatics Or our seasonings that we want in our rice pilaf So the seasonings could open up also before we toast the rice. So the first thing, a pinch of salt always, Which is about a half... It's about a teaspoon, forefinger pinch. To that, I'm going to add cumin. Same thing, about a four-finger pinch or a teaspoon. And a little bit of coriander, a little bit of nutmeg. We always add our spices when the fat and onions Are kind of toasting Because then it helps those spices open up And that's when you really maximize flavor. So you don't want to spend all this money on spices And then not maximize their flavor. You can really smell the spices now Getting very aromatic and opening up. - Smells delicious. - It does. And to that, I'm going to add 2 cups of I have basmati rice here. I like basmati and jasmine in a pilaf And we're just going to stir this. So the fat, the onions, the spices all come together. And the other thing this does Is it starts to toast our rice a little bit, Which gives our rice a really nutty flavor. It's also toasting the exterior of the rice. It's going to help you make sure you get A slightly more fluffy pilaf. Another good tip for making sure That the rice stays a little fluffy... We're essentially going equal parts rice to liquid. So I have 2 cups of rice, I have 2 cups of liquid. In this case, I'm using chicken stock. And as soon as this comes up to a boil, We're going to drop it down to a simmer By moving it to the front of the grill. The lid goes on. We're going to let that come to a boil. Hi, lizzie. - Hi. Oh, I've got to put a bay leaf in my... I forgot my bay leaf. Come on in. Come on in, peaches. I got a bounty of peaches. - A bounty of peaches, - round things out here. Michael: So we are making grilled peaches. Liz: So these peaches are very ripe. Liv: Do they have to be ripe? What if I just got them? They don't, actually. They could be not so ripe, But what's nice about a ripe peach Is that you can almost do the avocado twist on it. Michael: It just makes them easier to work with. It doesn't make them better or worse, just sometimes easier. To this, I'm just going to drizzle a little honey. You want probably about 2 tablespoons, But I'm just going to kind of eyeball it. I'm just gonna sort of drizzle it over. Now, these peaches are very sweet, So I'm not adding a ton. But what the honey is going to do is it's going to mix With a little bit of butter. It's going to make a little snazzy... - Wow, are these peaches good. - ...Butter and honey sauce. Probably I don't want to go... Well, there's that. - Happened to me, too, Don't worry. So let's just scooch that over there. Probably about 2 tablespoons of butter. So I'm just going to zest one lemon in here, And I'm going to do the juice Because I like lemon as we all know. Okay, so now we're just going to... ...Pouch this up. Now, if you didn't have the bundle, I've seen you do this on a sheet tray right in the oven Just without the bundle. - Yeah. So you could put it on a cookie sheet, right? You could or even in a, you know, A skillet, you know, like a cast enamel. All right. I'm going to show you what's going on with the rice. So as soon as that liquid is absorbed, I take it off the heat. - Look how great that looks. Yeah, I take my fork and I fluff it up. And then after we fluff it, To absorb some of that additional moisture, You take a towel And then you put the lid back on over the towel. So as it steams, the towel is absorbing the liquid So your rice doesn't get sticky. All right. So the last thing I'm going to do Is I'm going to take off these packets That I made, and I'm going to take the clams. I'm going to put them on the tray. Remember I said these clams stay hot for close to 30 minutes. So you want to do your best to get them out So you don't leak juice because we want that juice for the rice. Liz: Oh, I'm so excited about these. I love clams. And then I'm going to put the peaches in that same pit, And we'll close the lid now because the coals are starting To come down a little bit temperature wise. I'm going to take a little peek in here to see what's going on. Oh, yes. Wow. See, liv, how they're popped. - Oh, yeah. - So we're going to close it up So we could hold the heat, pull the moisture. Those are going to continue to open up. Peaches are going to cook. Rice is hanging out, Staying fluffy. And we have a little what? - I'm making Some delightful fruit sangria with rosé. It's a rosé sangria. It's going to be great. Liv: That tool, what's it called again? Your little... This is a fish spatula. So we have other spatulas. I never use them. This is like a restaurant spatula. If you go to a restaurant, If you were to go to one of our restaurants in the kitchen, Not one single human cook Ever has used one of these in a restaurant. Everybody has these and it's because they're thinner. They're just... they're easier to work with. They're not so clumsy. Liv: Is there anything that's better to cook with those? I have not found it in my lifetime as a chef. So we're going to do a little citrus mascarpone to serve Underneath the warm peaches, creamy, creamy mascarpone. So I have 4 ounces of heavy cream, 1 cup of mascarpone, A couple tablespoons of honey, And then the zest of a whole orange, The juice of half an orange. And then I'm just going to whip this together. - That's going to be amazing. - All right. What do you got? Well, I am going to make a little overnight sangria. So what we're going to do to start, and I'm sorry, I'm going to infringe on your board here A little bit. - Oh, get in there. I can... So we just want to slice up one whole lemon. Then we're going to also do I can help you with some fruit if you'd like. You know what? You want to slice up some of this stuff. I've got some strawberries, Some plums, and a little half of a peach. And you don't have to get real precise with this at all. I mean, this is just going to really flavor And infuse your wine. So I'm going to juice one whole lemon in here. You really want probably about 4 cups of fruit, But, you know, you can just kind of eyeball it. See, you know, what looks pretty. Oh, these look nice. The beauty is that when you have this in your fridge overnight, It sort of takes on some of the alcohol So you can just eat the fruit and just be really happy. So I'm just going to do about 2 kind of scant teaspoons of sugar. Oh, a little orange liqueur. I'm also gonna put some orange liqueur in here. And you don't have to put this in at all. You could just maybe squeeze or put a little orange juice In there would be delicious. Oh, wow. Those look fantastic. - Thanks, honey. Okay, that's more than enough fruit. So I'm going to just take my muddler And just kind of mash this just a little bit. I don't want to break it up to the point Where the fruit's unrecognizable. All right. Now we're going to take our rosé. I'm just going to pop it in. We're using two whole bottles. So this is a recipe for two. So this is complete. We're going to put it in the fridge. Best if you do it overnight Because then it really... Those flavors Really come out and they're real poppy. But even if you went a couple hours, Like three hours or so in the fridge, You're going to be totally fine. Lizzie, as you're kind of stirring that up, I want to show you where we are. The peaches are almost ready, But I'm going to lay out our seafood. So we took the pilaf. I put the towel over top With the lid to absorb any moisture after we forked it. So look at how fluffy it is. - And it doesn't look mushy. - No, not mushy. It smells so good. And that's what you want. Jasmine and basmati rice, You know, I put some seasonings in here, But they just have such great natural flavor. Just plain. They're super nutty. - They really are. - By far, my favorite rice. And then I'm going to grab one of these. All right. So it's still steamy. Those clams have popped open now. Look at that. - That looks incredible. You can still sort of get That little hint of wine in there. Right. - Clearly... - The wine and the butter And that juice, see the juice pouring out. Open these and just pile them up. And this is the beauty of these packets. You know what the beauty of this is, is no dishes, - That is a huge thing. - You have no idea. So I'm going to garnish with a little cilantro. But you could use parsley, basil, no herbs at all. So this is done and ready to go. - That is just heaven on a plate. I want to show you these peaches. - Yeah, let's see. - Because this is hot. So you can use tongs to open this. Yeah. Be careful because that steam is really... But look at. See, it's starting to caramelize on the bottom, Which is beautiful. Those peaches are cooked through, they have some liquid, They're tender. - Super tender. All right, lizzie, I'm going to continue whipping this cream And we have a little crumble almond thing That we're going to garnish this with. - Yes, shortbread almond crumble. - All right. If you are a gardener and I know there's a lot of you out there, Make sure at the end of the season When the herbs are done, and you can't use them anymore, Hang them, dry them, And then you could get the benefit of them all year. So these peaches look beautiful. Yes, they do. They're going to be delicious. I'm just gonna put them in the bowl for you. Do you mind if I pass this on to you Because I have some bashing down here. Oh, yes, I don't want to be part of the bashing. So I'll get the peaches in the bowl. This couldn't be an easier quick topping. These are just roasted, salted almonds And this is just some shortbread cookies, Which we're also going to mash up. So I'm not going to mash all of these. Let's do three stacks. Okay. - I'm excited. - Oh, oh. - Okay, I think we're good. Okay, and these, I think we're going to be A little more delicate with Because I almost hate to do this to those poor little cookies. So you're starting to plate those. Once I put these all in the plates on, I'm just going to drizzle some extra virgin olive oil on top And then they're ready. - All right, look at that. You can see those little flecks of orange in there. That mascarpone orange cream Is going to melt down on those hot peaches. These salted almonds are going to be terrific. And then we're going to do a little shortbread. I'm putting extra shortbread on mine. Okay, and the last thing we need to do... - Sangria time. - I was going to say, But not least. - [ laughs ] And I'm just going to get some of the plums in the... Strawberries in there. Yeah. - Oh, man. That's gorgeous. Let's get a little cheers here. - Cheers to you, too, love. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Oh, my gosh. It's not too sweet at all. Even though we put that orange liqueur in And a little bit of sugar, It's still very, very refreshing and nice. This... speaking of perfect... - You got the juice in there, That basmati rice with the coriander, cumin, and nutmeg. I just went right for the rice, And it is amazing with that little bit Of clam juice in there. And liv, see, you were asking earlier why middle neck clams. But see what I mean, it's the perfect size clam. It's not too small. It's still small enough that it's tender. It's not giant. It's a perfect size clam to me. That is amazing. But I have to try this. - I want to try your peaches. They caramelized a little bit. - I put sugar prep, that's okay. Liv: I was just thinking that. I thought you were making the special one for me. Silly me. Oh, my gosh. Mmm, mmm, mmm. This is seriously amazing. The sweetness really comes out of the peach Because it caramelized. - Amazing. I'm taking my rosé. - Okay, respect. Get in there. - Okay, I want the peppers. Like, you know how I like to have everything on my plate. That's a big one. Michael: That's what I love about the ladies of symon dinners, They're not afraid to take a real bite of food. Oh, my gosh. This rice. I could just eat the rice alone. Like even if you did a little vegetable packet, It'd be great, you know. - Okay. - Oh, my god. I need... - That is a perfect bite You just took. I mean, come on. Oh, my god. This is the perfect summer dessert. Michael: All right. We had the sausage, peppers, and clams served Over that beautiful rice pilaf with a little bit of coriander, Cumin, incredible sangria, rosé, a little bit of orange liqueur. Super refreshing and great. And then the fire-roasted peaches With that whipped mascarpone. Delicious. So here's what I love about the no-look cook... Easy as can be. You could customize it for all your friends And you don't have to clean pots and pans. My favorite thing.
