-Nothing in particular. The orchestra is the same as last year... ...except for the violins. Here's the schedule. - Still accurate? - Eh? - Still accurate? - Yes. Roberto, the schedule. 2.45pm, arrival at the hotel. That's right. 2.50pm. He will not have to linger. At 3.20pm, a radio interview. Someone will take you there. At 5.15pm, the theatre. 5.45pm. -Thank you so much. -Mister Roberto! I'm delighted to see you again. You know me, don't you? Torquato. Let me introduce my wife, who admires you so much. It's my pleasure to meet you. I love music so much. -And that's not all... She sings. She's even sung operetta. -I try. I try. Couldn't you hold him back? What are you looking at? These two boys. I'd like to be one of them. -Because they sing? That's the way you have to love music. But we know you love it more than they do. But maybe not the way it should be. But where do you get those ideas from, darling? They just come by themselves. Give me a kiss. And cheer up... the radio man is waiting for you. Ah, Roberto! Hurry up... Let's not waste time. We have a very busy day. I'm here to drive you. It is 3pm. We just have time to make it for the program. I'll meet you at 6.30pm. Yes that's it 6.30pm. at the Florian. - Roberto is well? - Yes. - His mood? - A bit down. Excellent! See you later. He's getting even deafer. At least if it was me, I'd talk less nonsense about music. Isn't that so? Poor Roberto... I understand him less and less. - But what's bothering him? - It's his age. He has everything he wants. And an orchestra to distract him. -It's not a distraction. When told that it's a job, he gets offended... ...out of idealism. He's at the age where they seek our reason for living. The decision's made at 14, whether to be a sailor or a priest. For him it's decided. He's a musician. For an artist, it's not just a question of making a decision. For artists, life is not a journey... ...but a perpetual quest. And what are they looking for? To reach the moon? That's pretty much it, yes. If only he could be like the others. I understand how you catch the fever in Venice... ...with all the still water. Hear that? It's live. Where's it coming from? From everywhere and nowhere. It's the city that sings. It sings all the time. Here, we hear the music because there's no noise. And that's what gives fever to it. Oh, you give it to yourself. Miss... look... You'd do better to go to bed, Roberto. There's no point... I'm already asleep. Have you always loved Venice, Miss? I'm romantic. Venice scares me a bit. Last year, it amused me to be here... ...well, on the water. But now, there's something else. I'm intimidated. Venice is a great personality. It's like music. Music is a great personality... Very great. Well, now, you go to bed, Roberto. Want to stay to listen to this old song? You're unlucky, Mum. It's Mozart. Good night mom. Let's go back to "Le Bal" from the beginning, please. A little more piano, please. Sweet. Very soft. Figure 2. Attention... three times and a bit of ritardando. 2, again. I've worked out a price for the armchairs... ...but I've no more velvet. We'll improvise with all of them. Stop! That's alright... Let's see "La Marche au supplice". The resonance isn't there. Mr Torquato? What is it? 5 double basses... That's not right. But last year, you only had 5. Last year was last year. There needs to be 8. Very well, you'll get them. Thanks. Let's go back to figure one. Timpani a little louder, please. Figure one, still. I really don't know what's up with him. He's become so demanding. The demands come naturally. The demands for what? I searched for 50 years, then I gave up. Now, it's over for me. But he might find it. Would you like me to tell you? The impossible is what you seek. Precisely. All I want is to reduce expenses. I'd at least hope that they're useful for something. I'll show you. What are you doing there? I was listening. Exactly! You have no right to be here. -You don't know. -Who are you? What's going on? Allow us to do our work. Are you leaving? Yes or no! Let's go back to figure one. Vino rosso? We're going to the Lido! Bye. It's not very hot warm. Where's the towel? -Roberto, where are you going? You're doing it wrong. Want me to help you? You have to be better than me. Those things are a bugger. It's very simple, when you know how to do it. You know how to do everything. Conduct an orchestra... set up a chair. You recognize me? I've a good reason to. Yesterday I got kicked out of your rehearsal. - That was you? - Yes. Didn't things go smoothly yesterday? The orchestra is fine. I'm not talking about the orchestra. Wait. I'm going to get some cigarettes. -Roberto! What are you doing here? Come on, let's pedalo. Go ahead without me. See you later. Come on, Guido. No no. Stay seated. It's obvious, isn't it, that things are not going smoothly. It's strange. Last year was fine. It proves that you've made progress. It is to progress, to find it more difficult? It is. However, I like how the symphony is. It feels polished. But I'm feeling there are problems. Where? I don't know yet. But... people... Are you really nervous? At least you tell me something. The others are happy to congratulate me. They're not wrong. No one ever tells me anything. I struggle alone. That's because you're successful. Oh, I don't care about success. A good point. What do you think of me? Well... why would I say? I don't know. I do. Dear me, my boy... I've been your age. You make me think of David, armed with his sling. He was awkward, he was clumsy. He was engaging and he was very scared. Because he was faced with someone much stronger than him. All the same, he did face Goliath. So please aim well. In my case, I missed. You're a musician, aren't you? I missed. A failed musician. - Oh no! - What? Surely not a failed musician. You know better than others. You're still a child... yet it takes the strength of a giant. So, do I give up? But you can't even do that. Is there anything other than music, that is worth the effort? No. Would you abandon music? It wouldn't abandon me. So? You have to realise it's not funny. Vocations are prisons. We're locked in. The walls keep us from living normal lives. No need to try... we break our noses. Didn't you notice my broken nose? So how to get out from our walls? Nothing mundane is any good for us. Our prison has no roof... But the only difficulty is... ...we have no wings. So... One does what one can. But you've already understood the principle. "Success never proved anything, either for or against." - It's from Comfort. - A musician? Oh no... He's a writer. He was in a prison, too. He said, "In the end, we get tired of ourselves." But that's just something that concerns me personally. And since others start over... Since you're starting over... Oh, I'm getting familiar with you. I'm pretty dreary, eh? I haven't scared you, have I? That's not what I'm afraid of. -What are you afraid of? I don't know... Giving a poor performance. You alone are your own judge. Is that requirement a defect? No, it's a quality... And you have others. Come on... go and have some fun. You wouldn't want to come to my concert tomorrow? Want me to? I'll leave you a ticket at the booking office. Yes, but in what name? Lorenzo. That's all you need remember. Lorenzo. I'll remember. I signed 10 freebies, and 11 have gone. That includes the one given by Roberto. By Mr Roberto. Roberto does not give freebies. - Check it. - Certainly. This is what I'm going to do... Did Roberto give a seat to someone? - No. I'd know if he did. - We will see. To the left of the aisle... the tenth row. The one next to the jump seat. Do you know that man? Yes. Leave it at that. - I have a son. - He's from me. - I'll protect him. - I know your protection. You wasted your life... You're not going to waste my son's. Who is mine. Did you remember that when you left me? You found lots of excuses. You wanted to follow your calling... Respond to the call of genius. Your vocation was alcohol. As for genius... where did your genius go to? Because you did have some. It was said, "He will be the best pianist of his generation." "He will be." But he wasn't. And now you... Did you dare to tell him that you were his father? You see! You're still drinking, aren't you? More than ever. So what do you live on? To think I once loved you. And that I married you... that's what's amazing. I thought I could help you. How stupid! You only ever liked to destroy. And I would give you my son? You don't understand. I never understood anything you said. I'm just a woman, but, alas, surrounded by brutes. Because you men are brutes. I've regretted a thousand times that my son turned out to be... exceptional. But he's my son. I don't want it to become a lazy, drunkard, like you. I want him to find happiness. You only love misfortune. You don't understand. I don't want to understand. I'll just tell you one thing... If you're proud of yourself, then make yourself known. But if you're still honest as you used to be, then hide. I no longer have to hide myself, Lucien. Nothing is left of me, except my son. He's what I used to be... ...and he will be what I could've been. In him alone can I look at myself without shame. Are you going to deprive me of this last right? Your right? What about your duty? Even if I'm silent, he'll always be my son. Unfortunately. What will you do now? I don't know. You have to acknowledge the audience! Well, Roberto... Quite a triumph, eh? Has he gone? -You heard? Yes. I I is gone, and it's better. - "Is it better"? Mom, if you knew how wrong you are. -Roberto! Dottore, you don't think that's enough? Lorenzo, come here. She told me just go away She told me go away... ...without trying to see him I said good day to you You said goodbye to me And you'll tell him many things... ...from me Mother and child... ...quite simply... ...have never been worth to stop drinking Wasn't that beautiful? Bellissimo! It says what it means, very well. She told me go away She told me go away That's enough! You're giving us earache! My beautiful Lolo I'll stop when you've brought me another bottle. I could maybe play piano with my feet. I bet you it wouldn't be so bad. Then I'd perform at fairs. I'd perform the Concerto for Left Foot. Then I'd make a career. There's your bottle. Ah yes, my beauty. But there is someone unpleasant at the table. Lorenzo, come here. Really?! You wanna piss me off? He must, since he has the bottle. No. - What about me? - No! Please! Just a little drop. It is too sad. Now he breaks the glasses... What are we going to drink from? Hold back a little better than that. Does breaking my glasses help? Don't you look good! Where are you going? I'm going to his hotel Leave her son alone. If you go like this you'll lose him. If you become presentable again, maybe. Lorenzo, listen to me. And stop staring at this bottle! You who were such a good pianist... Pulled yourself together! Don't let yourself be bogged down here. You have to leave... change your environment. No, I won't leave. I'll make you leave, this very evening. Otherwise, you'll be looking for him. No, I won't leave while he's here. You have to take care of him. I have a rehearsal shortly. Let him drink if he wants, but not you. It's going to be painful. Get him a ticket to Rome. He can live at my brother's, who's in Geneva. Yes... that's what has to be done. Which instrument does he play? I don't know. The musicians meet in the evening in Santa Sofia Square. - Thank you sir. - 'Bye. Whether? Yes? Oh, it's you, dear friend. What? Roberto disappeared? Why are you telling me? No. I came straight home. I saw nobody. Forgive me for disturbing you. I was so worried. Yes. Yes, I shall let you know. It's my fault. I realise that it's my fault. I shouldn't have. I shouldn't have! What's she mean? Hello? Can you give me the theatre. The manager. - Do you know Lorenzo Lombardi? - No I don't. I told him that the fact I hadn't paid... ...didn't justify him answering me in that tone of voice. We discussed it but we didn't agree. You won't find him here, but at his house. So go see at the Gadway Party over there. Thanks. Lorenzo? Lorenzo! What are you doing? How could you get into such a state... ...just when you have to go. Get up! Come on, Lorenzo. You hurt yourself, too. Wait, I'll wake you up a bit. Fortunately, I have a small bottle. It smells good. Ammonia. It'll bring you round. That's it, like that. I have your ticket, Lorenzo. I won't leave. In any case, it's not a reason to sit on the floor Come on. Come on. The key. Lorenzo You'll have a little coffee. Lorenzo, come on. Get up, Lorenzo. Come on, drink your coffee. And hurry up, because we haven't much time. I won't leave. I have your ticket and the money. You're not going to do that to Crespi. - I won't leave without him. - Without Crespi? No... Without my son. I won't leave without Roberto. Well, good. Here's another idea! Go get me Roberto. Where would I find him? Then I'm not leaving. But what is Crespi going to say, if you don't leave? Roberto The third are at the front. That's our luck. For Mum. I've never seen so many swallows. There are always swarms of them here. - They seem to be calling to us. - Maybe. They're said to be like thoughts. The thoughts left here by all who stop here. But listen to what this language is reduced to... ...that man has created, word for word... ...with little cries of these swallows. Do you understand what they say? - That we must hope. - Yes. Always. I know. Ah, my son... What do you know? When we are gone, there'll be two more swallows. That's a fine looking staircase. It's not straight... Look at the obelisk. It doesn't line up with the square. But it's still there... that's the main thing. My life is also not straight. Why not? - From wanting to straighten it. - You don't have to straighten it. That's the whole point. While people talk... ...artists build stairways or symphonies. The result is there. Art is the only acquisition, and we are the only realists. In short, there's still hope... for artists. There's even more for them. Your mother, of course, doesn't speak the same language. We'll have to explain ourselves to her. I've never tried before. It's useless. You love her, she loves you That's enough. And you? She loved me, I loved her Everything else is my fault. Is that really what you think? Yes. It's my fault. So there is hope. Always hope. But we're in Rome. Only hope can accumulate so many ruins. On top of each other. That means we started over. We can always start over. We can't start over without it. - But wait until she arrives. - She should be here. Your friend gave her our address. But she may already be here. Or a letter? We need to buy something to eat, Roberto. And cigarettes. I'm all out. - Will it take long? - Well then, run ahead. Grazie. Camiere! You're not going to deny me that, Mr Lombardi? I'm so happy to see you again. We're so bored in Rome. What are you having? You never know what to have. I drink whatever I'm given. - Do you want brandy? - If you want. - Two cognacs. - Right away. I recognized you right away. It's been a long time. Don't you remember? In Pleyel, in 1938. I was in the orchestra. You played the "Emperor" concerto. I'll remember it all my life. I don't remember you at all. Of course. Nevertheless you're a date in my life. That night, I believed in music. I played like I've never played. That night, I didn't sleep. I saw myself giving concerts. It's silly. Oh, you're lucky... you great soloists. I beg your pardon What is your instrument? The double bass. The double bass. Waiter... Camiere! Two more cognacs. "The Emperor" concerto... Well, that's an idea. Cheers. Life is beautiful. You will see, Roberto. Now I have a project. I have a goal. This will be our project. Our goal. Sleep, my little one. Sleep, I'll watch over you. And have nice dreams. We'll be happy. There, I slow down the movement. Always the same tempo. Oh, the coffee! We are most definitely bad cooks. So I'll be the first to talk to Mum? What are you going to tell her? Well, that I love her. That we love her. That it's not difficult to put this concerto on the program. What is she doing? What time is it? My watch! I'm silly... I haven't wound my watch for 3 days. Telephone from Venice. Pronto! Pronto, Venezia. Pronto, Roma? Pronto, Signora Lombardi? Mrs Lombardi is no longer at the hotel. Her address? A moment, per favore. Care of Mr Rose, 124, Avenue Mozart, Paris. Prego. She is not there anymore. She must be in Paris. I've no idea what could have happened. I'm afraid to understand. - Your mother's letting us down. - Oh why? Teach us a lesson. "Are you leaving me? Well, fend for yourself." - Mom would never do that. - How would you know? I just know. She always thought she was indispensable. Because she is. I was starting to realise it. Surely that's not it. We have to write to her. Does a letter for Paris take long? What are you going to write to her? That I love her That we love her. There's no more ink. "Dear Mum" What do I say? "Why are you leaving?" It's us who left. Oh, help me. Well, you want to tell her that you love her, so say so. - "I love you as much as before"? - Yes. "I love you as much as before." And then? Do you want me to help you? Give me that. "As much as before" "I love you too as much as before." You didn't just come to show me the way. - I just thought... - You're losing your memory. Oh no... But in certain circumstances, I can't think straight. You are going to have to go first.. - I made a mistake. - But I did, too. I risk ruining everything by saying the wrong thing. It's best for you to tell them my feelings. I have so little courage, Madam. You had some, to come and confess to me. But there will be two of them, and I'll be all alone. No, I need to have something to relax me. So if you'll excuse me... goodbye, Madam. Listen...! Excuse me, I'm in a very great hurry. "We will never be happy, when there's not all three." "And we can be." "We "will never be "happy when there's not all three." "and we can be." Mum! My darling... Lucienne Lucienne, I... I have many things to tell you. Here you are. It will save us a stamp. My God! How can anyone live in such a mess? Such a mess? Wait, Mum... - And so many plates! - The landlord had a lot. - And me? - Something for everyone. And all this spoiled fruit. I can't talk and do the dishes. You must have done a lot of talking. Sometimes, it's better not to speak. But it's urgent. Tell her, Dad. Yes, Lucienne. We have a project. We'll have to heat water. Put it all there, children. And try not to break anything. You haven't asked about our project. As if we could make projects. We get things wrong all the time. I'll be satisfied to do the dishes. Mum, you know the "Emperor" concerto? Wasn't it at Pleyel in '38? Yes. Well, we'll do it together, Dad and me. How quickly children grow. The "Emperor" concerto... To think that you were just born. You're not both a little crazy, are you? How simple happiness is. Yes. One city is enough... preferably eternal... Some summer song masterpieces, in the evening... Very easy to come by. And not to be alone anymore. Very easy, too, since here we are. But Beethoven's concerto may be more difficult. - Yes I know. - So? When could you do it? In Paris? In two months. Mum, what do you think? I don't dare to think anymore. Think about it, Lorenzo. Two months. Can you, in two months? I'll knuckle down and work. Let's go back to the 2nd quarter. Mark all the sforzandos well. One two three four. Good. Let's go back to the 1st movement. - Where are you going? - See Mrs Lombardi. - No one in the room during rehearsals, ma'am. Madam! - You should continue. - Continue what? To give concerts. What if I don't want to anymore? - What else do you want to do? - Nothing. Did this concert make you tired? Didn't it work? It works. It even works too well. It's me who keep it up. I can always conduct an orchestra... ...but can I still make music? - Everyone seems to think so. - Except me. Do you miss your father? - I thought I was no longer alone. - You have your mother. I would like so much make her happy. One more reason to torment me. I am responsible for her. You are still very young. Am I really? At 10, I was a conductor. At 14, I made a career. I'll soon have all my future behind me. Success! Look at them. They're lucky... they have no success. They take the time to grow up. Me, I'm a hermit crab, in my success. Without strength, when I need it most. You're a little depressed, just now. Have you seen a doctor? That's what it is! It's not by making me say "aah" ...that he'll discover music deep inside me. It's there, it's growing. It grows inside me like a disease. If I'm not big enough, it will consume me. To fight myself, I need weapons. Dad told me. What would he say to you now? Every night, I call him, but he no longer responds. Lorenzo! Oh, how handsome you are! Did you come back to see me? How nice. Are you passing through? No, I'm staying. - I was sure of it. - Why were you sure? Because you're better off with your friends. But whatever happened, Lorenzo? Nothing. Nothing happened. Come on... get something to drink. You can't guess what happened? If he loves Venice, why wouldn't he come back? You want to know? I'm just happy to see you again. No problem. My dear Lorenzo, let's toast. May our Venice still stand. We don't know how! You are very cheerful. It's party time. Yes, he's sleeping. Germaine, I can't stand it anymore. Since this failure of Lorenzo and since his disappearance... Really... I don't know what to do. Thank you for answering my call. I would have come anyway. Roberto and I don't know what to say to each other. He avoids me After the concert, he left. And I've no idea where he went. He came to find me. Why? He doesn't know what to do, either. If only I could tell him. He'll figure it out on his own. The thing is to give him the means. - Me? - Oh no. Especially not you. We're a necessity for the children, but not indispensable. Men learn for themselves. I believe that you'll have to leave him... ...before he leaves you. Him too? "Leave him"? Oh, Roberto... Roberto... Roberto? I heard someone calling me. My God, what's wrong? Mum! Pay attention to what Mr Galibert tells you. Rest assured, I am neither a doctor nor an apostle. If I was a teacher, I've forgotten everything. So I'm not dangerous. We'll bring him home to you. Goodbye Madam. Goodbye, Germaine. And now, we are going to leave. Goodbye Mum. Good bye, young lady. Be good. Don't forget to write. It's that simple. Will he be able to get cross Paris? Don't worry, he likes challenges. If you wear this outfit... ...you'll scare the cows! To love the countryside, is to take root. That's what's missing with you... roots. So you'll put them down... like a tree. Thank you, Hortense, my dear. This young fellow must be hungry. Your mother seemed an excellent woman to me. But from my experience of excellent women... It's like that Germaine, your teacher. She was in love with me. All the students were in love with me. That Germaine's a very brave person, too. In short, you were surrounded by good souls, like a baby Jesus. Why accept to take me? Because I suspect a certain pigheadedness in you. I'm pig-headed? I hate music. Me too. I think all musicians are like clowns! Of all the creators, they are the only ones who want to show off... ...by making a noise which bothers everyone else. - Please protest. - No. I agree. There's no more conversation possible. It's a shame. I will now show you my secrets. Do you know what it is? A tape recorder. I have one. For your amusement? Oh Lord! Do you feel that you need to keep it? It's for self-criticism. What I record is beyond all criticism. Because, instead of music... ...I prefer the cries made by animals. How? You make animal noises in front of this device? No. I go and collect them. The 1st cuckoo of the year, the crowing of the rooster. All of your Beethoven is not worth the lark's. The proof... When Beethoven announces spring, spring may or may not come. But the lark never fooled anyone. When spring is here, so is it. Could I hear an animal cry? Go to the window and you will. You're sure to start well. You don't have any swallows? - Mr Lombardi, please. - The third house on the left. She won the lottery. Yes, these are my students. Is that what you came to see? What have you come for? What more do you want? You succeeded, however. It's what you wanted. Ah, your looks... Your tenderness in Rome, when you came to join us. You even kissed me, for heavens sake! And then quickly, a concert... ...to finish me off, let's talk more about me. You couldn't stop Roberto and me from getting together. Wasn't that already despicable... ...to have forbidden a father to see his son? Then you made it worse... Gave to a son the shame of his father. Go on, go away. Enough! Go away! What is it you want? To savour your revenge? Yeah, I did dump you. This is where I am... in a dirty jacket. I have no money. Anything else you want to know? I no longer eat, I drink. Yes, I drink. It'll kill me. Happy? Calm down, Lorenzo. So what's the point of this life... ...which offers you everything and holds everything back. Talents, and at the same time, what it takes to lose them. Hope, all mixed up with despair. But why am I both at the same time... ...a musician and a drunk? I didn't choose. I didn't cheat. It was you who cheated! Why do you cheat? Why do you all cheat? What are you afraid of? No, it's me who's afraid. Yes, I'm afraid Life... ...is only fear... ...that we try to quell. I'm afraid. I'm afraid! What's become of me? I can't see anything. Oh, I'm afraid. Oh, I'm afraid. I'm abandoned. You're not abandoned. Picking up rags? I'm nothing. You don't know what you are to others. You have a son. But I lost him too. Does he have to lose you? Roberto needs you. Accuse me, if you want. Leave me, both of you... ...but find yourself and one another. That's why I came, Lorenzo. You're unwell. You're just unwell. You have to take care of yourself. I'd like to see Roberto again. You need to take care of yourself. Can I still take care of myself? Yes, Lorenzo. - And heal? - And heal. Your life and his are in your hands. Lucienne... Do you want help me again? Pass it here! Here, quick! Pass it back! Oh, that's clever! I have something for you. Where's it from? Roberto, don't abuse your strength! Come hear the cuckoo instead. Oh, him and his damn cuckoo! Roberto, are you happy with me? Dad! I lost my ticket. But it's thanks to me. I fixed it all. Surely you can let me in? Do you understand me, sir? No sir. I am deaf. Mamma mia! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
