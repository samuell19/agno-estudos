Eddie, I'm going to miss this. Haiyan Opera House -Mr. Postman, look and see -Mr. Postman, look and see - If there's a letter in your bag for me? - If there's a letter in your bag for me? -I've been waiting a long, long time -I've been waiting a long, long time -Since I heard from that girl of mine -Since I heard from that girl of mine Have you seen Yee-yee and Yee-na? Your mom is looking for you. Where is your little sister? Didn't she go to you for a headband? That was ten minutes ago. You two are almost up. If you miss your show, you'll end up marrying an ugly man! Hurry up! Have you seen my little sister? Here you go. Bye! Little Pearl, he didn't even say thank you. Why bother helping him? You do this every time. If he had said thanks, I would've replied, "No need to thank me". So it's pointless in the first place. I can't out talk you. Let's go. If we miss the show, we'll end up marrying an ugly man. I'm too pretty to marry an ugly man. Then you should... - Hurry up. - Hurry up. - Hurry up. - Hurry up. Ever since I saw you by the lovesick river I've felt a spring breeze in my heart I want to tell you tenderly Don't you forget about me -Ever since -Ever since -I lost you by the lovesick river -I lost you by the lovesick river -I've felt an infinite pain in my heart -I've felt an infinite pain in my heart -I want to tell you tenderly -I want to tell you tenderly -Don't you forget about me -Don't you forget about me -Don't you forget about me -Don't you forget about me Haiyan Opera House Thank you! Why is there only one candle? I'm already six years old. When can I have a birthday cake with cream on it? Silly girl. The ones with cream don't have egg yolks inside! When I get rich, I'll cover your cake with candles! Sounds good? Sure. You two look awfully sneaky. Are you up to no good? - No. - No. Have you thought about my offer from last time? If our mom sees us dancing for you in Enjoy Yourself Tonight on TV, we'll be in big trouble. Adam Cheng! I'm coming! How about this? Don't tell your mom. I'll provide transportation and give each of you 50 bucks. Then you can get something decent to eat instead of stealing Gorilla King's mooncakes. Think about it and get back to me later. I look up as I walk So the tears won't fall Adam is so amazing. He speaks both Mandarin and English. He even knows Japanese! He is so well-educated! It takes ten years of hard work to perfect a minute on stage. Memorize a couple of foreign songs for yourself. You don't need schooling to have a future, right? Right. Counting the stars with tearful eyes Remembering those summer days On this lonesome night Happiness lies beyond the clouds Happiness lies above the sky For a very long time... For a very long time... Once upon a time I came to this corner Alone, I searched for the place In my memories Just once, I fell in love A love that burned brightly I can no longer Return to that time I can only Pray As I wander the street That is filled with sorrow - It has been a while, D! - Where are you headed? I'm sorry! We'll catch up next time! -Once upon a time -Once upon a time -I sat on a chair in a shop -I sat on a chair in a shop -Alone, I look out at the street filled -Alone, I look out at the street filled -With memories -With memories -Just once, I fell in love -Just once, I fell in love -A love that burned brightly -A love that burned brightly I can no longer -Return to that time -Return to that time There are calluses on both of your vocal cords. It's no big deal. It's treatable. Get surgery to take them out. I mean, remove the calluses, not your vocal cords. Can I still sing after the surgery? Singing is no way to make a living. You should get a proper job. Hiring Remembering those summer days On this lonesome night I look up as I walk Waves upon waves Go lower. Waves upon waves It works, but it doesn't sound good this low. There's no oomph in it at all. Let me do it. Waves upon waves Your sister shouldn't force herself. You're a better singer than her anyway. Why don't you go solo? No way! No way will I simply accept fate I'd rather spend my life going against it I refuse to let the Heavens dictate my life -Take my hand -Take... Relieve me of my pain Use the love in your heart Help me become the phoenix in the fire Breaking through the barriers Your voice has more character when you sing mezzo-soprano! Pardon me. I'm Michael Lai from Capital Artists Entertainment. I'm Mui Yim-fong. I'm sorry. Nice to meet you, Mr. Lai. I'm a huge fan of Nancy and Michael. I'd like to be pretty as a flower To be honest, I'm here as a lobbyist of sorts. We're holding the New Talent Singing Awards with TVB this July. The winner will get a record deal with us. TVB and Capital Artists... We've hit the jackpot! I don't smoke. But the doctor just told me that I can never sing again. And I'm saying you can. I've been to dozens of bars, nightclubs, and cabarets. You two are the most talented and it's clear to me that you will win this thing. The problem is solved. I was going to say I won't follow his orders! Good! Life is simple. You do what you're good at! Thank you. What does that mean? I think that means you're fired! Hey! If we win the competition, we don't have to sing covers anymore. Maybe we should forget it. We don't know who we'll be up against. It'd be great if we win, but we'll be laughingstocks if we lose. It sounds like you're afraid of losing to me. Me? Afraid? I'm just there to keep you company! No matter how it goes, don't be a sore loser. You're usually the sore loser, Ms. Mui. No way. - The application is such a pain... - I'll take care of it! That sounds about right. I'll even give you an English name. Which letter do you want it to start with? A. So I'll always come in first. How about Arigato Mui? Come on! Do you have anything shorter? Doesn't that sound swell? The host will say, "Here comes Arigato Mui!" Anita Mui, Pass Judge Ann Mui, Disqualified Why aren't you eating? I'm fine. You win some, you lose some. It's good that you made it to the finals. Are you sure that you're okay? You're on your third bowl. When's the final? It's on July 18th. On 18th... Get me two tickets. I'll take Mom to Lee Theatre and we'll cheer you on. Wait, Teddy, we didn't order that. It's on the house. Our boss is a good man. He knew you'd be here so he got a new hairdo. It looks really nice, right? Give me a beer! I'll be right over! Think about it. Enjoy the food. Eat your veggies. Shut up and eat your crabs. Yes, ma'am. What song are you going to sing? I haven't decided yet. You should sing the song I picked. The cool breeze blows gently and zips quietly into my blouse Summer is being stolen away without any sound The fleeting days overwhelm me with emotions I find myself reminiscing about those vibrant days Huff and puff, let the wind blow Let it dry the crystal tears in my eyes Huff and puff, let the wind blow Take away all the pain This girl is something else. She has a good voice and great stage presence. She's a girl with a baritone voice. She seems rebellious and stubborn. Stubbornness also means tenacity. Didn't that work out for you? The First New Talent Singing Awards She wowed us from the start. The winner is Anita Mui, "The Season of Wind"! When is she supposed to arrive? She has two more minutes. - Mr. So. - Just in time! Anita. That's Florence from the record department. This is our General Manager, Mr. So. Well? How do you like your golden armor? The most important thing in showbiz is to have something that no one else has. We'll have the best talents in Hong Kong to produce your records from now on. We will give you a new look too. I understand. Anita. Listen to these demos. If anything suits you, let me know. Thank you, Florence. I'll work hard. We'll be working with TVB from here on out. Anyway, we will fight for everything that helps our artists. On the other hand, we hope our artists will cooperate. Are you ready? I got you the best stylist in Hong Kong. He wants to meet you in the flesh first. Let me remind you. He's a very talented artisan. An eccentric one too. No matter what, don't be late. I'm looking for... Go to the office. This place is small. What? Go to the office. Thank you. I won't slash a cent. My tailors are destroying them now. I'll cut them all up before I lower my price. Ask anyone who has worked with Eddie. I don't sell cheap clothes. That's that. Come in. - Good morning. - Good morning. Do you like Akina Nakamori? I do. You kept the same hairdo from the competition. You're not bad, but a bit bony. Are you too poor to eat? Let me see your teeth. I didn't ask for a smile. I asked for your teeth. They'll need fixing. Your shoe size is 37.5. Spot on! Kid. I started doing this before you were born. Sit down. When was your first love? What? What? Didn't you hear me? When I was 13 years old. Puppy love doesn't count. I was serious about him. The most painful and sweetest relationships are when you're 16 years old. Describe them with lyrics. Why lyrics? I want to get a feel of your taste and sense. Why don't I just sing them for you? I want to see your handwriting too. But my handwriting is terrible. I dropped out after eighth grade. Education doesn't mean a thing. I've seen plenty of educated scums. A single song will do. A single line of lyrics is fine too. You have half an hour. I have somewhere to go. It will feel odd hearing your own voice during recording. That's normal. Just relax. If you feel uneasy about anything, raise your hand. What else should I watch out for? You have the technique. But you have to sing with emotion, especially in ballads. Don't just express how sad you are. Express sorrow. How about fast songs? For fast songs, don't just express excitement. Express rebellion. Got it! Hello. What are these? Don't be offended or anything. This cup bets that you won't finish recording tonight. It pays one to one. This cup bets you'll finish before sunrise. It pays one to six. The cup on the left... This one bets you'll finish before midnight. How much does that pay? It's 1 to 20? With those odds, why is it empty? It's 1 to 200. Then I'm definitely in. I thank you on behalf of the studio. Anita. Theme song of TV series Soldier of Fortune Mr. So. I want to know the story of Soldier of Fortune. I'll call the producer. A debt weighs heavily in my heart This debt to you lasts forever There's an infinite amount of love At the bottom of my heart This infatuation That has long been in my heart soothes me I can only hope that it makes up for everything I've exhausted all efforts I've disregarded everything Why has my boundless infatuation Been in vain? Debts of the heart Cannot be repaid in a single lifetime But it's hard to appraise the worth of a thousand lifetimes What's wrong? Johnny Yip is too ill to perform tonight. That sounds serious. What happened? We only have three hours. Does Mr. Cheung know yet? It's Rose Garden, the nightclub in Jordan. It's Mr. Shing's new joint. I'm free tonight. Gangsters frequent that place, Anita. I'm used to those places. Exactly, what's wrong with that? Let me get you a partner. Consider it a warm-up show. Anita. Hi. I'm Leslie. So you're my partner. I'm counting on you to watch my back. I should say the same. I rarely perform at nightclubs. It's no different than other shows, as long as you have thick skin. Then I'd better put on some more foundation. Anita, the guests outside heard that Johnny couldn't come. Now they're furious. Three tables with local people, one with Taiwanese and I think the last table is Japanese. Got it. Wishes often lead to disappointment Who understands the loneliness in your heart? The tears fall endlessly The world is rarely fair When it's time to be happy, be happy When the curtain falls The loneliness will weigh on you Get intoxicated, go to sleep Sweet dreams are even lonelier After you're drunk There are still trails of tears On these silent lips These aren't scars That can be covered with rouge How much love has This broken soul lost? The lies to mend things The excuses you give back I won't take them seriously If love can be repaid Then we can part for good Don't forget a woman A woman like me You're far too kind You're like a child Tomorrow We become strangers We become strangers We become... Strangers - Great! - Great! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you. Allow me to introduce... Leslie! Leslie Cheung! Hi, everyone! I have a new song for you all tonight. Silently Swimming Upwards. Lady luck won't offer her hand But I'll fight with all my might What's wrong with him? I resist fate with my chest held high I grip my fist with strength Success doesn't fall from the sky I won't take the cheers in vain I want to put my heart into it I want to give it my all I want to become a great drummer You just picked the wrong song. Who hasn't struggled before making it in this city? Those customers weren't too bad already. I'm sure even Sam Hui has been booed before. The two of us will have our day in the Hong Kong Coliseum for sure. When you have your concert, I'll be your special guest. And when I have mine, you can be my special guest. Let's make one thing clear now though. We'll have to perform for free. You're a true friend. Look into the stands from the stage. If you see anyone not applauding, sing to him until he's impressed. Sing to him until he claps. Come on. Thank you! Thank you! -I seek my dreams on the stage -I seek my dreams on the stage If I wish to find my dream, I must be on stage I shall change my current self Because my success shall roar loud The winner of the IFPI Best Newcomer Award is... Ms. Anita Mui! Please welcome Ms. Anita Mui! The RTHK Top Ten Gold Songs Award goes to... "Red Doubts"! The winner of "Years Flowing Like Water" is Anita Mui. A Sound Of Thunder is approaching eight Platinum Record Thank you for being my guest tonight. The pleasure is mine. Congratulations to Anita Mui! Anita Mui represented Hong Kong to attend the 12th Tokyo Music Festival. She even won both the TBS Award and the Asia Special Award. - Be careful, everyone. - Anita. Mui! Hello? She happens to be right here. You can tell her yourself. Anita. Who is it? Swallow that first. Hello? Yes. Ms. Yam? How do you do, Ms. Yam? Yes. That's too kind. A recipe for opening up vocal cords? Sure. Boat-fruited Scaphium Seed... With warm water... Got it. I'll take good care of my voice. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Why didn't you tell me Ms. Yam Kim-fai was on the phone? It's natural for seniors to help their juniors. It's no big deal. - Yuki! - Yuki! Please welcome Mr. Godo Yuki! Hi, everyone. I'm Godo Yuki. Ms. Mui. You have to be at Regent Hotel by 3 p.m. The driver has been waiting downstairs for half an hour. Got it. Give me 15 minutes. I'll wait for you downstairs then. Godo Yuki, Four Platinum Records I'm starving. Let me grab a bite first. Go say hi first. I'm sorry, we're late. That's okay. Mr. Godo, she's the one Florence wants me to introduce you to. She is Hong Kong's Momoe Yamaguchi, Ms. Anita Mui. Momoe is an idol of mine too. Your performance at Tokyo Music Festival was great. How long have you been learning Japanese? Just tell him. Ms. Anita says she only learned that song. She feels embarrassed. That's amazing. Hi, I'm Godo Yuki. Ms. Anita, Mr. Godo would like to have dinner with you before he goes back to Japan. It's so cute! Hold the chili sauce. Extra soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and sesame. Jeez, you're demanding. Aren't you that superstar? Just put in whatever you want. I'm going to put in a lot. Be my guest! Run! The police are here! What happened? They're running away. Run. Ghost. Run. Ghost? Never mind. Are you okay? Okay. To my Momoe Yamaguchi I'm home! I'm sorry, I'm late. It's okay. I wrote this song for you. Song name? Hitomebore. What? It means... "Love at First Sight". - How is it going? - Mr. So. How's your relationship going? It's not bad. I hear you're flying to Tokyo again tomorrow. You're barely in your twenties and you already have multiple gold records. Now you're holding a concert in Hong Kong Coliseum. Do you think you're a star already? I don't think so. Convince me with this concert. Sure, you and Godo can keep dating. But I can confidently tell you that your careers as singers will be good as dead. Over the years, I've seen many singers set foot on this stage. They are all musical geniuses. But for every ten geniuses I see, nine of them fail because they lose their focus. Their talents went to waste. I don't want a hollow shell of you on that stage. Think about it. Leslie said that you're doing his image on his next album. Treat him as well as you treat me. Worry about yourself first. I've talked to Mr. So. No matter where you are in Japan, fax him your hotel address and phone number. Don't go AWOL on him. Is Mr. So still mad at me? He's even more open-minded than me. Just make sure to balance love and work. You're an adult. We can't keep you on a leash. Why can't people in showbiz date? No one said that you can't date. But you have to learn to protect yourself and to keep it private. Of course I'm all for you seeing someone. Do you know what a female artiste's biggest asset is? Sex appeal. How do you get sex appeal? It's by having emotions and desires. Love with all your heart and be brave. Hello? Really? Ms. Miwa? Mr. Godo? Please quickly translate to her for me. Okay. Thank you so much. Hello? Ms. Anita, this is Miwa. Mr. Godo asked me to tell you that the head of his agency is on the way to your hotel. What? What should I do? Find a place to hide. There's nowhere to hide in this room. Find a wardrobe. Have you seen Doraemon? This way, sir. Mr. Godo. We're going in, sir. Sir. Your recent gossip has been more exciting than your career. Rumors are flying... about you and that Hong Kong singer. I'm sorry! Plenty of male singers are coveting your spot. Make one mistake... and you'll lose everything. Career or love... You can't have both. Tell her to come out. That's... I'm sorry! I can't do that. I'm sorry! I can't do that. She doesn't speak any Japanese. I must protect her. She did nothing wrong. If I ask her to come out right now, I can't call myself a man. Please forgive me, sir! Please let us go. Your recent gossip has been more exciting than your career... He pushes his body close to mine From my forehead, he starts kissing me gently What's wrong with the lyrics for "Bad Girl"? How are they explicit? Since radio stations have banned the song, we have to pull it from the concert too. The fans love the song. Radio stations can ban the song all they want. What does that have to do with Anita's concert? "Bad Girl" got me where I am today. I must sing it at my concert. Just as we should stand by our friends, we should stand by our songs too. If anything happens, I'll take the fall. "Bad Girl" The Best Female Singer is... Anita Mui. I'm thrilled to win this award for the second year in a row. Thank you for your support! I'll keep working hard! Why why tell me why The night breaks down all taboos Even ladies are secretly tempted to go wild. Why why tell me why I just can't be a Goody Two-shoes I secretly resent myself for being far too naughty tonight Anita Bye! No problem. Goodbye. Good morning, Golden Harvest. Hi, Mr. Chan. Sure, please hold. Who are you here to see? Mr. Leonard Ho. And your surname? Kwan. Stanley Kwan. Rouge Godfather, I've read the novel for Rouge. I like it a lot. Good. But I do have a question. Who's going to play the role of Twelfth Master? Do you have someone in mind, Anita? Leslie Cheung. Thank you, pal. The director has given me more scenes. Was that your doing? It's natural for the director to treat you well if you're good. Of course I'm good. If you're a screw-up, nothing I say will make a difference. Don't worry. I won't screw anything. To be honest, when I took this film, I didn't care about how many scenes I'd have. It's because I know you're not over him. You seem so sad so I came to keep you company. Who told you that I'm not over him? You don't have to pretend in front of me. Sure, you know-it-all. Thank you for keeping me company. Don't overthink things. Learn to love yourself. Okay? Congratulations to Anita Mui for her Golden Horse Award. And now, I'll announce the winner of Best Actress. Anita Mui for Rouge! Congratulations to Anita Mui from Rouge! Please head in. - Bye! - Bye! Anita. It's an unprecedented battle armor. Try it on. It's your starting-over gift. Are you done yet? Not yet. Don't come in. Just stuff them in. Push. Do you think the audience will be horrified? Are you afraid? Impossible. I'll wear whatever you make. Ms. Mui... - Anita! - Anita! Do you need painkillers? Ann says I may have a chocolate cyst. Shing, cancel the show. No, the show must go on. - Anita! - Anita! - Anita! - Anita! Watch your step. At the night, loneliness is delivered via the screen It's past 2 a.m. The broadcast ends with the dimming of the titles It's hard to constrain myself in front of the mirror In my solitude, I long for comfort When you go, love and warmth depart with you These flaming red lips long to be soothed Tenderness and desire are completely lost The flaming red lips in the mirror Are left only with a dry beauty Put down those embracing arms The hollow heart has derailed This flame cannot be contained Since I still love you so I'll cool my fire and sit back down These flaming red lips long to be soothed Tenderness and desire are completely lost The flaming red lips... - Anita! - Anita! Little Pearl. Hey. Why are you calling me Little Pearl again? Are you getting married? Is it a shotgun wedding? No. Shotgun, my foot. Did Mom spill the beans? I don't need Mom to tell me. It's written all over your face. You naughty girl... Do you have a photo of him? Not bad. He looks like a decent guy. Aren't you engaged? Why are your fingers still bare? Where's your engagement ring? It's sparkly. Why didn't you wear it? Are you worried that I'd be upset? Get out of here! I'm over the moon. - Hey, boss! - Yes! - Get me two bottles of San Miguel! - Okay! My sister is getting married! Anita! Stop telling the whole neighborhood. This is great news! It shouldn't be a secret. Babylon shells in spicy wine sauce. Come on, eat up! We got it. Drinks are on the house tonight. - Congratulations. Enjoy! - Thank you. Cheers. Okay. Keep it down. Ms. Mui is sleeping. She only sleeps well with noises around her. Silence will wake her up. Watch this. See? I told you! Let's continue. Ms. Mui must be very lonely. From Ann: Where are you? I'm here. You don't have to call me. Ms. Mui. A cup of coffee, please. That one is just so-so. Try this on. The cutting looks great. You should've called if you were busy. I'm just a little late. A little? You're four hours late. I could've flown to Japan using that time. And you'd throw a fit if I started first. I guess only your time matters. I have a fever, Your Highness. Is that so? Let me see. Really? You insisted on being my bridesmaid. You told me to come to try the wedding dress! What's the big deal? I'm here now, aren't I? What else do you want from me? I raised you. I know everything that goes through your head. Did you want first dibs on marriage and kids before I get my turn? If that's the case, then I won't get married. Ever since we were kids, haven't I always let you have your way? Can you recall a time when you didn't win? I don't ask for much. I just want someone by my side. I'm sorry to bother you, Ann. This is Shing. The maid went back to her hometown so Ms. Mui has been alone at home. She hasn't answered my calls for three days. I'm worried about her. Can you come to check on her? Mui! I'll look upstairs. Mui! Ann. She has been getting drunk every night. Did she tell you what's bothering her? Shing. Don't tell her that I came by. Forget it. You can't understand women. I'm thinking about retiring from the stage too. I'm worried that my body can't cope anymore. I don't want to collapse on the stage. What are you afraid of? People carry you to the stage all the time. I'm not retiring from singing. I'll keep releasing records. Now I really don't get it. Between singing, acting, and performing on the stage, the stage is your favorite, and it's your forte. Why would you quit? You're retiring too and you're judging me? What matters is what you like. Don't worry about the gossip. I thought you'd be against the idea of me retiring from the stage. I'm not talking about your retirement. I'm talking about you and Ben. Seeing him in nightclubs is one thing. You bringing him to see me is another matter. He looks like a tough guy and all, but he's petrified of meeting the parents. That's an excuse. But every time I go public with my love life, it never ends well. Why are you so cowardly all of a sudden? You're a female warrior. This isn't a period film. Actually, someone does want you in a period film. Johnnie and Stephen are remaking Ma Si-tseng's The Judge Goes to Pieces. They want you for the Hong Sin-nui role. Is it a comedy? Is she a female warrior? Happy Birthday from the crew of Justice, My Foot! Take the photo! What are you doing? Stop pretending to be Eddie! You look good. Come on. - Ready. - Wait! What is it? Let me finish my puff. Come on. One, two, three! Smile! Open up! Four, six! Open up! Drink up, loser! I got you! Again! I have to go to the loo. We'll continue later. - Ms. Mui. - I'll be fine. Ms. Mui. Hi, Ms. Mui. My name is Joe. Care to join my boss, Mr. Kwok, for a drink? The same Mr. Kwok who frequents this place? Yes, that's him. Anita Mui! Mr. Kwok. I'm a big fan. Thank you. Come on in. Come in. Cover that up. I didn't even hit you that hard. Why all the blood? Don't scare our big star. Come on in and sit down. I appreciate it, Mr. Kwok. But it's my friend's birthday tonight and it's almost midnight already. How about I drink with you later, after cutting the cake? Later? Screw later. I know it's a bit smoky and unpleasant in here. Let's drink outside. I'll go outside with you. Come on. Cheers! She really drank all of it. Very nice! You're a true heroine! I make movies too, you know? Free up some time next month. How about I invest in some movies for you? Ms. Mui won an award for Rouge, I believe. Then Rouge the sequel! How about that? I'm sorry, Mr. Kwok. If you'd like to offer me a role, please have your assistant contact Mr. Ho's secretary. Leonard Ho? Sure. I'll ring him up tomorrow to have tea. Anyway, it's just business. This is a joyous occasion! Why don't you come in and grace my boys with a song? - Sounds great! - Come in and sing! I'm sorry, Mr. Kwok. It's time to cut the cake. Pardon me. If you won't sing in my room, I'll hear you sing in yours. You're singing the birthday song, right? Then the birthday song it is! Sing it! Mr. Kwok... Stop talking back! You won't come in for a drink. You brush me off when I offer you a freaking movie. Now you show your back to me when I ask you to sing? Do I look like a beggar to you? This is your last chance. Are you singing or not? Did someone just slap my girl? Who is talking now? Aren't you Ben? I've heard so much about you. It's a misunderstanding... What? Are you looking for a fight? That's right. So what? Sure. If you want a fight, I'll fight you all the end way! Are you dead? Get up! Get him out. Why did you have to provoke him? Anita, I've asked around. I heard about what happened. I showed him as much respect as I could, Godfather. He just kept pushing it. That Kwok is a real nutjob. The film industry is a real mess right now. I know you can be bullheaded sometimes. When you face people like him, being tough doesn't help, all right? Okay, I'll talk to you later. Someone is taking advantage of this. The guy who slapped you just got his ass kicked by a group of thugs outside his place. Someone is going to put this on our heads. Why don't we get away for a bit? Let's leave for a few days. This whole mess has become too complicated. When the dust settles, I'll figure out a way to resolve this for you. What's there to resolve? It's not my fault that he got beat up. He's the one that slapped me. This isn't the first time I've been slapped in a bar. If I was in the wrong, I can apologize with a huge banquet. - But I didn't do anything wrong. - Fine. Your godfather is right. Kwok is a madman. He has people running around to take us back! It looks like a mere apology won't resolve things this time. People come and go like the wind... Eddie's friend has a villa in northern Thailand. We can hide there. Hello? Hello? Ann. Mui. Wait. Hello? Where are you? Everyone is giving me a different answer. I'm in Chiang Mai. I know you've got nothing to do with this. Don't worry. Ann. I miss you. Silly girl. I miss you too. Do you have anyone with you? Ben is with me. Ann Mui. I have to go. Watch your health and take care of yourself, okay? It gets cold at nights and mornings there. I will. Bye. A Career in Free Fall, The Truth behind Anita's Escape Hey, wait until it's time to eat. Where are you going? I need to talk about something. I am not sure when... Maybe someday or sometime later, I might sing again for charitable purposes. So I won't do a microphone-hanging ceremony. But I do want to make myself clear. After tonight, I'll stop performing on the stage. What on earth are you doing? It has been resolved. We'll go back to Hong Kong in a week. Do you want to go out tonight? Mui. Today is the Lantern Festival. People will send off sky lanterns to ward off bad luck. I'll go buy one. I've already ordered some food. Hello, my name is Avarin Petthong. My nickname is Deedee. When I was just a little girl I asked my mother What will I be? Will I be pretty? Will I be rich? Here's what she said to me Que sera, sera Whatever will be, will be The future is not ours to see Que sera, sera Now I have children of my own They ask their mother What will I be? Will I be handsome? Will I be rich? I tell them tenderly Que sera, sera Whatever will be, will be The future is not ours to see Que sera, sera Anita. Without rain, nothing grows. A lot of people have helped you over the past six months. I didn't expect to be stuck in Thailand for so long. And it never occurred to me that once I bid farewell to the stage, I might not make a comeback. Anita. No flower can bloom for a hundred days. Many people in Hong Kong have immigrated in the past few months. Mr. So has gone to Canada too. He heard I was coming so he told me to ask you if you'd consider going to Canada as well. I won't go anywhere else, but back to Hong Kong. You know I'm not a confident person. I've been providing for my family since I was four. I'm not well-educated, nor do I have the looks. Truth be told, without the help and support of you lot, I wouldn't be half as successful. My career has been too smooth. If I get a second chance, I want to start anew when I'm back in Hong Kong. I don't want to be just an artist. Besides singing and acting, there's one important thing you've been missing. It's life lessons. Do something that really matters with your experience. I don't want it! Piss off! - Piss off! - Leave him alone. He's a bit agitated. - Come this way. - Go away! Hello. Maybe I'm imagining things. But after you returned from Thailand, you became a different person. Don't be so harsh on yourself. It will hurt you. It hurts more when I didn't know what I was doing. I know you have so much you want to do. The Gods have given me so much. I've caught them with my left hand and it's time that my right gives something back. You know, I never felt a thing when people called you Ms. Mui all these years. But now, I really hope that you can live up to your name, Ms. Mui. We're honored to have a guest that we haven't seen for a long time. Please welcome, our Ms. Mui, Anita Mui. - Hi, Ms. Mui. - Hi. Whenever we talk about Anita Mui, we immediately think of your ever-changing styles. "Bad Girl", "Rouge", "Years Flowing Like Water". You've been a part of our lives. But out of the blue, for how long were you gone? Was it eight months? Nine? More or less. Almost a year. Ms. Mui, would you admit that the karaoke slapping incident was a turning point of your career? I guess you can say so. It has been the toughest few months in my entire life. But I understand that life is never a straight line. So I thank the gods for the opportunity for me to see my own flaws. I have the spirit of Hong Kong in me. I won't resign to fate easily. Now, I'm back. As long as I'm in this industry, I'll continue to sing and act. And I will not disappoint. Let's talk about something else. Let's talk about your love life. You once said you would like to retire at the height of your popularity to get married, like your idol Momoe Yamaguchi. But up until today, none of your relationships has successfully bloomed into marriage. Your love life isn't particularly successful, is it? Not particularly successful? I'm a total failure. Otherwise, I'd be married by now. Don't say that, Ms. Mui. Actually, during your brief hiatus, Sally, Sandy, and Shirley have been catching up to you. Last year was the first time you lost the Best Female Singer award. According to the news, I know you've been participating in a lot of charity events recently. I couldn't help but wonder. With your career in decline and your love life stalling, is charity your only way to stay relevant? Am I right? I reflected a lot while I was away. That was when I realized something. People are in such a rush to make the big bucks and they seem to have forgotten basic ethics. Hong Kong is my home. As long as Anita Mui is still needed here, I will always be the first to help without any hesitation. As for my charity work, my conscience is clear. Anita Mui's second elementary school He won't eat it. On the 27th of this month, Hong Kong's artists will hold fundraiser to help the victims of the Eastern China Flood. Ms. Mui, please tell us how much we've raised. We got sixty-three million, three hundred forty-two thousand, and one hundred and ninety-two dollars! I have a final question for you before the commercial break. Where do you think you will be in 1997? I will be in Hong Kong. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park officially closed down The Hang Seng Index has plummeted by 13.7%, the largest drop ever recorded in HSI history. The HK government intervenes with the stock market and declares war on the speculators. Our actions over the past two weeks have effectively stopped the speculators. It's my honor to be the ambassador of Oxfam. I hope that I'll be able to participate in all the fundraising events in Yunnan and other places that need our help. Taiwan was badly shaken by a 7.6-magnitude earthquake. If we have the ability to help others, then we should give what we can. This event demonstrates the power of unity of Hong Kong and Taiwan's entertainment industries. Yip Chor-Jing? Who's that? He's the muscle man from our amusement park days. He was the buff guy who was always covered in oil. That's him. June 18th... I doubt I'll make it. Why not? People say that women either have kids or tumors. Get your body checked every year, got it? Got it. Your nephews are still kids. I wonder if I'll have the chance to see them grow up. You're on about that again. People should see things through to the end. If I don't make it, carry the torch for me. Little Pearl, are you okay? Ever since I saw you by the lovesick river I've felt a spring breeze in my heart I want to tell you tenderly Don't you forget about me Ever since I lost you by the lovesick river I've felt an infinite pain in my heart I want to tell you tenderly Don't you forget about me The whole time that Ann was ill until the day she died, she didn't complain once. Truth be told, she's a lot stronger than me. I always thought I had it all figured out. But I still have a lot to learn. Up until yesterday, Ward 8A of Prince of Wales Hospital in Shatin has seen more than ten medical staff develop fever and upper respiratory infection symptoms. Today, the number of people diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection soared to 115. Twenty of those patients are in critical condition. WHO Director-General Brandt officially announced that the new virus will be named "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome" or SARS. It's done, Ms. Mui. I knew about the tumor a year ago. The test results just came back. The tumor has turned malignant. It's the same thing Ann had. There's still a lot that I want to do. I'm afraid there's not enough time... Anything that you want to do, I'll help you do it. Keep it a secret for me. Especially from Leslie. I don't want him to worry about me. Mr. Cheung is already here. This way. - Leslie. - Eddie. It has been a while. You're late. I'm just joking. I got here early. April 1st, 2003 We've heard. But Ms. Mui doesn't know yet. I'll call you back, Nansun. What's up? Tonight, Leslie Cheung, affectionately known as Gor Gor, chose to end his life by jumping from a hotel in Central. April 1st, 2003. Be it ten years, fifteen years, or even twenty years from now, we will still remember this day. Driver, can I have a cigarette? Thank you. I've never done anything bad in my life. Why is this happening to me? I'm in so much pain. I can't sleep even with sleeping pills. Is it stress from becoming a director? Don't put too much pressure on yourself. You're just like Anita. Relax. Eddie. You'll remember me, right? How can I forget you? Eddie. Keep this a secret. I don't want people to see me like this. Especially Anita. I don't want her to worry about me. Ms. Mui! Hang in there! Hang in there! Hang in there! I was looking at our friends out there. I realized that most of them will come to my funeral when I go. My special guest... My one and only best friend in this business... Don't say that. You have many best friends. But we are family. Of course we are family. All these years... When did we ever need a rehearsal... when we shared the stage? Why did you have to put on a rehearsal for my funeral? You're so bad. How can you call yourself a friend? Why didn't you tell me that you were unwell? Don't be afraid. Sing while you wait for me. Stock clearance Another medical staff has died of SARS. Dr. Tse Yuen-man of Tuen Mun Hospital was infected while intubating a confirmed SARS patient. This morning, she died due to multiple organ failure at the age of 35. We're so miserable! They're useless! Someone should step down! Do you know how many people died? They won't feel pain unless they get hurt themselves! Ms. Mui. The Artistes Guild just faxed some titles over. They want you to make the call. Leave this naming stuff to educated people like Tina. Tina knew you'd say that, but you're the Chairwoman. You have to decide. Call it 1:99 then. Make it 1 against 99. It sounds fierce. Okay, I'll tell them. Everything proceeds as scheduled. Is there any problem? Am I dead already? You all look like you've lost your life savings. Wait until I am really dead before you start crying, okay? Ms. Mui. You're very ill. You need to rest and avoid working too hard. I will continue to do what I need to do. Ms. Mui. Leisure and Cultural Services has discussed your request. Would it be possible to postpone this 1:99 Concert of yours? Ms. Mui, our internal evaluation does show that the worst of the SARS epidemic has passed, but we still can't approve any request for indoor venues just yet. Besides, people are still on high alert. I doubt that anyone will be in the mood for a concert. Zo, what do you think? It's not a problem on my end. It has been a tough year for everyone. It's time for people to take a breather. It's totally fine on our part. We can do it. In all my years, I've never seen Hong Kong in such a bad shape. Back in the good old days, we gave to people in need. Shouldn't we stand up and help ourselves now that we are in trouble? The purpose of this 1:99 Concert is not just to raise funds for recovered patients and their families. The most important thing is to use this opportunity to cheer for our medical staff and all of Hong Kong. If I can't have an indoor venue... Give me Hong Kong Stadium! Hong Kong Stadium? The last time Alan Tam held a concert there, we received dozens of noise complaints. That concert was nine years ago! Ms. Mui, leave the set-up to me. I will ensure good sound quality inside the stadium and it won't affect nearby residents. I will get the performers myself. Please bring your heart, your ears, and of course your money to the concert. Start the concert early. Start at dusk and finish before 10:00 p.m. If you receive any noise complaints on that day, I'll personally go to their homes and apologize. The show must go on! Is there anything else? Ms. Mui. Do you really trust us with the rundown? Of course. You produced my last few albums. All the hurdles will get out of your way if you're doing the right thing. Only incompetent people whine and moan. They're afraid of being replaced by the young. Remember. If you meet someone willing to learn, you have to teach them. A senior has to help the juniors. Ms. Mui, if we stick to holding the concert here, I'm afraid we can't fill 40,000 seats. It will be a full house. I have faith in the Hong Kong people. Empathy and love are very important, especially with this virus situation going around. They need to know that we care about them and we will stand with them and support them. This is the message we have to deliver. Without her, none of this would be possible! Ms. Anita Mui, our music director. Please give her a big hand! She's our organizer. Come up here, Anita! Please welcome... Ms. Anita Mui! With another 5.6 million in live donations... We have raised over 17.9 million in total! We're almost up to 20 million! You can go to Japan. But you have to stop working and start chemotherapy once you return. Ms. Mui. I'm sorry to bother you. My daughter and I just want to thank you for taking the lead in supporting us, the medical staff. Don't mention it. Is this for me? Wishing you good health always! Your handwriting is so neat! Ms. Anita, will you hold a concert again? "Dr. Slump" is my favorite song. The government's launched a clean-up campaign across the city... Keep in progress for more than two months and we can overcome the problem. Please enjoy. Welcome back. Yuki. It has been so long. Missing chances at happiness is just a part of life at this point. That day... The call that I missed... I'm guessing that was you. I'm so sorry. If we could start over... If I was braver, perhaps our lives today would be much different. I've always thought all I want is an ordinary life. The fact is, it doesn't matter how I live my life. What matters is who I spend it with. I'm leaving soon. Will you remember me? Yes, I have cancer. I have cervical cancer. I have faith that I can win this battle. I strongly believe that I will be healed. I will recover in no time. I can tell you all. I'm not scared at all. I will prevail. I will not let you down. Mr. So. Mr. So. How are you? Have you taken your meds? Anita wants to hold a farewell concert at the end of the year. You know, everyone here loves you. You don't want us to worry, right? Mr. So. Eddie. Everyone has tried to talk me out of it. Please don't bother. I know what you're thinking. Every artist wants a swansong on the stage. But do you want to scare your fans? Don't listen to him, Mr. So. I promise you. If I make it up to that stage, I'll make it back down too. I have three other siblings at home. I was the only one born in Hong Kong. I'm not good at much, but the Gods gave me a gift. They want me to sing for the people here. I'll sing to the very end. People should see things through to the end. Eddie. Can you design a wedding gown for me? Who are you going to marry? The stage. When I went to the Tokyo Music Festival, you fixed my scarf so gently, just like this. I still remember it. That was your first time on a plane. I was so excited that I couldn't sleep. Let me tell you a secret. Do you still have secrets that I don't know about? All my life, I've never met my father. In my heart, Mr. So, my godfather, and you... are my fathers. If we meet in the next life, please keep loving me the same way you do now. Maybe you'll outlive me. This is the dowry for my wedding. I bought it myself. Isn't it beautiful? I was rewatching Rebel Without a Cause last night. You know, the James Dean film. It got me thinking. What would he be like now if James Dean hadn't died so young? He'd be in his sixties. He might look even cooler now. You just don't want to see some people age. Maybe it's best that they leave when they're at their most beautiful. 45 days before Anita Mui's passing Today's show at Hong Kong Stadium Eddie, I'm going to miss this. Thank you. How do I look in my wedding gown? You look great! - You look great! - You look great! It's a pity that the time for this has passed. Actually, I've worn a wedding gown several times. But they weren't for my real wedding. That's the biggest regret of my life. Still, I have your love. And that's enough to fill the void left by that regret. I've married myself off to all of you, music, and the stage. Before this concert, there were a lot of rumors out there, saying this and that about Anita Mui, doubting whether I could pull this concert off. Today, I'm proving to you all. As long as you have the will, nothing is impossible! We'll support you forever! You can do it! Anita Mui, we'll support you forever! I've always found sunsets to be beautiful though they're always fleeting. That's why we have to treasure what we have and fight for what we don't. Otherwise, we can lose everything in the blink of an eye. I chose this as tonight's final song because it expresses what I want to say. - Don't stop! - Anita! This is not the end! "Song of the Sunset". I hope you all like it. The setting sun is splendid But it's only radiant for a moment It disappears with the clouds Past glories don't return Years and months pass There are so many changes in life They gather and dissipate like clouds Weariness is all that's left The road is so long and the light is getting dim Joy lasts so briefly and doesn't return Who can see that my dream is simplicity? I've weathered so many storms Interlocked with my dreams and fantasies I once had your loving arm with me Through my times of need I've grown jaded in this race The road is difficult and filled with turns I wanted to turn back, but it was already too late The setting sun is splendid But it's only radiant for a moment It disappears with the clouds Past glories don't return Years and months pass There are so many changes in life They gather and dissipate like clouds Weariness is all that's left The road is so long and the light is getting dim Joy lasts so briefly and doesn't return Who can see that my dream is simplicity? I've weathered so many storms Interlocked with my dreams and fantasies I once had your loving arm with me Through my times of need I've grown jaded in this race The road is difficult and filled with turns I wanted to turn back, but it was already too late If I make it up to that stage, I'll make it back down too. The Gods have given me so much. I've caught them with my left hand and it's time that my right gives something back. Love with all your heart and be brave. Goodbye! I remember there once was a little songstress She was small in size I remember she didn't come from wealth She sang the old tunes at the opera house The old opera house was never full house Yet she continued singing so not to starve The old stage costumes looked okay from far But you could see holes on it if you looked closely I remember there once was a little songstress She loved staring into the rain Maybe she hoped when the rain is blown astray by the wind A new path would emerge Maybe one day she could be famous So she would no longer starve Maybe one day her costumes would be brand-new And the auditorium wouldn't just be half-packed The girl is me That girl in the past is me today I could never have imagined That you would spoil me with your love So I sing for you, I sing for you I thank you for never abandoning me Am I tired? Am I bewildered? I thank you for leading me through it all If I can sing for you forever That's all I will ever need When I gaze at you, I find love, I find myself Their creativity and imagination will surprise you. Arale and Gatchan are your best friends! Dreams are like explosives that will bombard you with happiness! Even the blue skies can't hide their giddiness! Look! Here comes Dr. Pig! Goodbye! I remember there once was a little songstress Her voice was not the tenderest She quietly sang her sorrow And heartache into the quiet air But her eyes always glowed and sparkled Maybe one day she will be famous And she would not starve again Seasons came and went As fleeting as her songs That girl is me That girl in the past is me today I could never have imagined That you would spoil me with your love So I sing for you, I sing for you I thank you for never abandoning me Am I tired? Am I bewildered? I thank you for leading me through it all One day, if I leave this stage and the music world for good, how many of you will remember me? Will I, Anita Mui, be missed? I'm not asking for promises. I only hope that someday, some night, when you open a window after dinner and gaze at a star above, you will remember a name that was once so familiar. A friend who once brought you a bit of joy. Her name is Anita Mui.
