I took my team out for drinks after work tonight. They've been doing such a great job on this project. What about that co-worker of yours you were telling me about? Sam? Is he still struggling with the workload? Actually, Sam's doing tremendous now. Oh. Oh, that's good, I guess. PETER: In fact, I'm even considering giving him a most-improved award.

Maybe I'm getting better. Sarah, listen very carefully. We may be in the dark here on what exactly is happening inside of you, but whatever it is, it's very serious. When you go home, you need to rest. You need to take care of yourself. You need to not drink. Do you understand? I understand. MAN ON TELEVISION: Very good. [ Moans] That's very, very good.

[ Phone whooshes ] [ Conversation on television continues ] [ Sighs ] [ Rap music playing ] [ Laptop chiming ] PETER: Hey, sweetheart. Guess what I just did? I'm not sure. Tell me. I just went to the gym. The doctor told me to rest, but I woke up feeling energized, and so I decided to go and work out, and I got very sweaty and hot, so the second I walked through the door, I took off all my clothes. I actually feel a lot better than I have in a long time. I don't think I'm sick anymore. It was probably just a cold. I looked up the symptoms online, and that was one of the possibilities. What's wrong? You -- You have a rare condition, and it's terminal. You're just imagining the worst. I'm fine, I promise. PETER: You accidentally put my number down on the primary contact instead of emergency contacts, so your doctor's been calling me, but I assumed it was a telemarketer, so I didn't answer. She must have assumed that you're screening your calls because she left a very detailed voicemail in my inbox. You're telling me this on video chat? I know. I'm sorry. How long have you known? PETER: Two days. I didn't know how to tell you. Sarah, you're going to die. Why aren't I crying? [ Knocking, door opening ] DOCTOR: I apologize for the voicemail. If we could keep this mix-up from making its way to the board of directors, I would appreciate it. Sure, that's fine. So, yes, you have an incredibly rare incurable disease. It is inside your stomach, but will eventually spread throughout your body. It will be painless, but it is killing you. We cannot know how long you have, but it is only a matter of time. What are my chances? Zero. There's a 98% chance you will succumb to your illness. I thought you said there isn't a chance. DOCTOR: There isn't. Then what about the two percent? That's the margin of error. There's a 2% margin of error. Nothing is ever absolutely certain, though this most certainly is. You're telling me there is a margin of error of two percent, but you're certain I'm definitely going to die? Yes. Unfortunately. You're taking this quite well, I might add. Most people cry when doctors give them bad news, which is why most doctors are depressed. I don't want to die, but it sounds like it's not up to me. To use a baseball analogy, life has thrown you a curve ball. Curve balls are tricky throws for the batter to hit. In this case, you're the batter. Only, you're not even holding a bat, so you most definitely are going to miss the ball. What's next? What are my options? You should decide on what type of funeral you want. It usually depends on one's religious views, but it can also be a reflection of your personality. For example, I know I want to be buried, not because I'm religious, but because I'm afraid of being forgotten. I want my friends and family to feel obligated to come and visit my grave. Of course, there are the remains from a cremation that can be buried or interred, but people are less likely to visit a pile of ashes. A body in a casket holds more of an obligation. You can even be buried at sea, though that's usually reserved for sailors. There are many options to choose from. I'll probably choose... cremation. Then there is the decision of whether or not you want to go ahead with replacement. I'm sure you're already familiar with the process. When you know you're going to die, you can have yourself cloned so that your loved ones won't have to suffer the loss of you. Here's a pamphlet, just in case. Thank you. Remember to discuss it with your loved ones first. Replacement isn't for everyone. For some families, it has even been a negative experience. -Can I have this? -Please. [ Soft music playing ] Hi, there. My name is Tom. I'm the head West Coast media relations officer here at The Facility. I'll be your host for this introduction to the world of replacement. Of course, we all know that cloning began dur -- -[ clicks ] -Our scientists have made countless exciting breakthroughs and advances in The Facility's proprietary technology. It's hard to imagine that, at one point, this all seemed like absurd science fiction. -[ clicks ] -This period is known as "imprintation". Your double is more or less a sponge at this point. They will soak up as much of what makes you "you" as they can before you die. Down to the littlest detail. The more time your double spends learning about you, the more "you" they will become. [ Laughing ] In some cases, however, your double may only have a very short time with you. Such as in the case of premeditated suicide. For originals who are very sad, everyday living is a struggle. This double may look just like his original, but he may as well be a different person altogether. For some grieving families, this is sufficient. I hope you found this video fun and informative. You may be dying, but don't let that affect those who love you most. Replacement is a gift to them. Isn't that right, darling? That's right. I'm a former double, going on 12 years of being Tom. Replacement works. [ Ringing ] Hi, I'm currently dying and I would like to schedule a consultation.

They should have mentioned that on the phone when you scheduled your appointment. Yes, they told me. I have a copy of my hospital charts. I can have my doctor fax a note too if necessary. RECEPTIONIST: No, the charts will do. I'm still not sure I'm going to go through with it. I'd like to talk to someone first, if that's all right. Of course. You still have to fill out the form, though. Of course. There's no way I can afford this. You must understand that this is a gift for your loved ones. Can you put a price on them not having to be sad? You're going to die. And we understand and are sensitive to that inevitability. What we do is we set up a payment plan. When you pass away and your double becomes you, they take over your responsibilities, and one of those responsibilities is to keep paying off the procedure. The most important thing is that you don't have to worry about anything. Other than dying with dignity. I'm afraid of needles, and I sometimes have nightmares of being put under anesthesia but waking up during the surgery. All you have to do is spit into this. How long does it all take? About an hour.

And your hair shines in the light better than mine. I like your shirt. MAN: I should tell you that there was an error in the coding process. It affected the gene that determines eye color. We're happy to decommission this double and try again if you'd like. Oh, no. That won't be necessary. Blue eyes are less common and more interesting than brown eyes. Great. We'll give you a five-percent discount on the process to make it up to you. SARAH: Oh, that would be wonderful. Before he put me in these temporary clothes, the technician made a joke to me about how now he's seen you naked. Are you hungry? Not right now. What are some of your favorite foods?

SARAH'S DOUBLE: Is there a style of music you like best? I like all kinds of music, particularly pop, rock, and hip-hop. Would you like to listen any of those right now? Maybe later. I'm enjoying this conversation, and music might make it hard to hear each other. Are there any styles of music you don't like so much? Country. And Metal. It's just a bunch of noise.

He won't be back for several more weeks. I hope I get to see him again before I die. He's very handsome and hard-working. He sounds like it. I'm excited to meet him. SARAH: I'll introduce you to my mom, too. What about your dad? He passed away a few years ago. 50 percent of marriages end in divorce, but... my parents were still together when he died. I never saw them fight. I know she misses him. SARAH'S DOUBLE: I'm excited to meet your mom. I haven't told her about you yet. I haven't told Peter either, but I'm going to. Actually, I'm not sure I want my mom to know I'm sick. I'm afraid she'll be sad. I'm her only child. When you're gone, I promise to love her as much as you do. Maybe more. Same for Peter. I will love him so much. Let's get some clothes for you. You don't have any cellulite or love handles. I guess I don't have either of those things. You're right. Feels slightly loose on me. I may be a size smaller than you. You should probably take me shopping. What's your favorite sexual position? Um, it's boring, but I like missionary. Sometimes, it's nice to be choked. Lightly. What's Peter's favorite position? He likes standing both from behind and facing each other, and he likes to blindfold me, but I like to be able to see him, though. Sure, but I imagine not being able to see heightens the other senses. You know, I don't think I care for this top. Maybe when you take me shopping, I'll look for a different style.

Sarah, I don't know how to tell you this, other than direct and to the point. You've gone into complete remission. You're not dying anymore. You told me it was certain. I did mention the margin of error. Are you sure? My stomach is hurting a little bit right now. DOCTOR: Did you have anything to eat for breakfast this morning? No. DOCTOR: You're most likely just hungry, then. I don't understand. DOCTOR: To be perfectly honest, we don't either.

This call is to notify you that she will be exercising her rights in accordance with the 28th Amendment of the Constitution. Your double has filed a motion to stay. What do you mean "stay"? WOMAN: I suggest you consult with legal counsel. Have a nice day. It's a fairly standard motion to stay. All the usual stipulations. No contact with your double starting immediately. Because the lease is in your ex's name, you're being asked to move out. They're giving you two days, which is quite generous, as usually it's only one. The duel to the death will be in approximately one year. The exact date to be determined by the court at a later time. And you'll be expected to pay support to your double in the interim. Wait, did you say duel to the death? Yes, it is to determine which of you will live the rest of Sarah's life. We can't have two of you walking around forever. That would be ridiculous. I thought she was going to be decommissioned. Well, in cases such as yours, when an original is going to live after all, the double is usually decommissioned, yes. But, in even rarer cases, when a double has been in the world long enough to start becoming their own person, they sometimes would prefer to continue to live. They can request a stay and a duel is set. I thought the duels were only for prisoners who commit the crime worse than murder. They're also used for stays. Haven't even seen one on television? They're quite popular. I don't care for violence. It makes me nauseous. Well, you'll need to get over that if you want any chance of surviving your duel. I suggest taking personal combat training lessons from a personal combat trainer. Also, we should discuss my rates.

You will have 10 seconds to choose a weapon. Your opponent will be obstructed from view during this 10-second long decision-making process. If there is a gun on the table, it is most likely that both combatants will choose it. But guns run out of bullets. And axe does not need bullets to slice through an arm. An axe is much heavier and slower than a dagger, which you need to be in close proximity to use. So, you see, it is all about careful yet decisive strategy. Yes?

The knife got knocked out of my hand. -TRENT: Ah, ah... -SARAH: I block the sword, and tie up your hands with the garrotte. Not only did that force me to lose my grip, but it's also slicing into the radial artery of my wrist. Ah! [ Grunting ] Not only is this cutting off the blood supply to my brain, but the wire is slicing into my flesh. [ Grunting ] I'm dead. Good. You should have used the gun. Always use the gun if it's an option. I know, I just... I find guns to be boring and overused. I know what you mean, but if it's the difference between life and death, it's okay to be boring. Only a week to go, but I would say that you're feeling very strong, both physically, and mentally, I'm going to kill her. I just know it. Can I help you find anything? No. I'm just browsing. Well, let me know if I can help in any way. Wait! I'm looking for an outfit to die in. You're in luck. We just got some pieces in for the new season that are to die for. No, not to die for. To die in. I'm looking for an outfit that if, hypothetically, I were to die in, I would be okay with. Something that reflects my personality and is functional, but mainly, I need it to be flattering to my figure. I've gotten in shape over the past year, but I still carry insecurities about my body. If I'm going to die, well, at least I want to do it looking my best. I don't care how much it costs. Fuck! [ Sighs ] Shit! [ Applause ] SARAH: What do you mean, "postponed"? LAWYER: Due to weather. SARAH: I don't mind getting wet. LAWYER: Well, the issue isn't rain. There's a chance for thunderstorms. Then when? LAWYER: In a month. A month. LAWYER: Another thing. This delay is considered an act of God. So you'll need to continue paying support to your double. - The double. - Of course. For another month? I spent everything I had yesterday. LAWYER: On what? An outfit for the duel. [ Lawyer sighs ] LAWYER: If you default on your payments, the court will assign you a handicap. Such as having to duel with one arm tied behind your back. I'll figure something out. WOMAN ON TV: The double has won the duel. LAWYER: Goodbye, Sarah. WOMAN ON TV: He's Robert Michaels now. [ Soft applause ] [ Triumphant music ] SARAH: How have you been? PETER: Good. I started a new job recently. Hey. SARAH: Do you like it? PETER: I think I do. I don't know yet. [ Chuckling ] -How are you? -I'm okay. They postponed the duel, as I'm sure you're aware. I am. She doesn't talk about the duel all that much. I was surprised you wanted to meet up. It felt like it was time. I want to apologize for how things ended. I know I said some really hurtful things there. I understand. I took it as you trying to push me away. I wanted to see you and tell you I don't hate you. I wouldn't want to die with you thinking I hated you. I appreciate you saying that. I'm going to try my best to kill her, though. And I won't be sorry for it. I need you to know that. I know. Should we order something to eat? I think that would be nice. [ Chuckling ] SARAH: Hi, Trent. The duel has been postponed. Can I keep training with you for another month? Uh, well, I was wondering... [ Keys jingling ] ...you know how you were talking about other forms of payment that were mutually beneficial? Does that offer still stand?

Oh, that's good. I know this isn't ideal for you to wait another month to duel your double to the death, but look at it as an opportunity. Try to see the positives. Another month means another month of training. Do you see this dog here? The one here on the leash? Hm, his name is Connor. I named him after my grandfather. -He's your dog? -TRENT: He is. SARAH: Aw. He looks friendly. TRENT: Do you see that crossbow there? -That one? -Yes. Grab it. Stand over there. Shoot my dog. Why? Connor is very old and very sick. I don't want to. It's okay. He's suffering. He's in an immense amount of pain. You'll be putting him out of his misery. Do it, Sarah. Please. He's in agony. I can't. [ Sighs ] I understand. I'm disappointed in your killer instincts. But... at least my dog is still alive. ♪♪ [ Dog barks ] What the fuck, Sarah?! [ Tense music ] ♪♪ I'm sorry. ♪♪ [ Panting ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ GIRL: Hi. SARAH: Hi. Did you lose her? Did you lose your twin? [ Birds chirping ] Yes. I can't find my twin sister. She looks exactly like me because we're twins, just like you two. Have you seen her? She's over here. [ Knocking ] [ Rattling ] You don't have to be scared anymore. We found your sister. When I and Abby were really small, and we went to the store with Mommy, and a man came up and wanted to show Abby a toy. I wanted to see the toy, too, but the man said that if both of us would be looking at the toy, Mommy could get scared that where are we. When Mommy came back, I told her about the man, but Abby was gone. Abby didn't come for three days, and they found her in a parking lot. I missed her terribly much, and I cried a lot, but now, we are all the time together, except when she goes to talk to Miss Murphy every Sunday. But your sister is here, and she loves you very much. Girls! Who are you? Let go of her. -Sorry. -Mommy. She asked us to help to find her twin sister. I think you should leave. Come on. I know you're in there. SARAH'S DOUBLE: You're going to try and murder me. Look, I realize I shot at you. I've been training for a year to kill you. It was instinctual. You surprised me. What else would you expect? SARAH'S DOUBLE: We're supposed to wait until the duel. I know. Open the door. I promise I won't try to murder you. SARAH'S DOUBLE: Okay. [ Door creaking ] You almost got me, even through the glass. I'm surprised I missed, even through the glass. I'm agile. Can I ask you something? Sure. When we first met, all those months ago when I shook your hand, why didn't you look me in the eye? I'm not sure. I think it was because I knew what was going to happen. I mean, I knew I was going to take over eventually, and I think I felt a sense of guilt. Taking over my life was the plan, not stealing it. I understand you feel that I stole it, but it's my life, too. But it was my life first. Yes, but that doesn't mean my life matters any less. -But your life is my life. -It was your life, but I've moved past your life and made it my own. Yes, but you knowingly stole everything that made up my life to make up yours. I understand that you feel like I went about it the wrong way. And to be honest, it's not what I thought it would be anyway. What do you mean? Well, Peter and I argue about the littlest things sometimes. For example, last week, I wanted to watch a romantic comedy, and he wanted to watch a dark comedy. How can I be with someone if we can't even agree on the genre of film we should watch? Or take our mother. She acts like I owe her my life. Phone calls, just to talk. Texts asking me, "How are you?" One before 9:00 a.m. saying, "I love you very much." And don't even get me started on the amount of forwarded social media posts that are only moderately funny. They already have a day for mothers. Isn't that enough? What are you trying to say? I'm still not sure. It's your life now. I've moved on, and I'm making a new one. I'm still going to kill you in the duel. But I'll make it quicker and less painful than I had originally planned. I want to take you somewhere. Where? We're a little late. CARL: I pushed him and he fell over. He held up his hands as a shield. I will never forget the screams he made. SARAH'S DOUBLE: Sorry. DARYL: That's all right. Please come take a seat. Carl had just started to tell us about how he's been feeling. Since his duel. I can't remember exactly where I was. My memory isn't what it used to be. In the moment, shooting my double in the face didn't make me feel bad. I knew it was him or me. Seeing his brain on that grass meant that I was going to get to spend more time with my children and grandchildren. It's been three years. But I still wake up from nightmares. I cry in my sleep. That's why my wife sleeps on the couch. She can't stand to see me this way. Sometimes I wonder, what was the point of fighting to live... if this is the life I'm living? Nice try. Your mental tricks aren't going to work on me. Nothing you do or say or he does or says or they do or say is going to keep me from surviving this whole mess. SARAH'S DOUBLE: It's not like that. Believe me when I say that I'm going to do my very best to kill you, too. Just like I've also definitely been training to do. I just wanted you to see people like us and hear their experiences. Whichever one of us lives is going to have to live with this for the rest of our life. DARYL: Your double's name is Sarah's Double, so I can only assume your name is Sarah. I'm Daryl, the group leader. I'm responsible for starting the check-in process, and I ensure individuals stay on topic. I also introduce the arts and crafts activity of the meeting. Perhaps we should move along to that. Everyone raise their non-dominant hand. I want you to use this hand to compose a letter to your original, or to your double, depending on which one you are. This is to help you connect to a part of you that could also feel like it belongs to another person at the same time. You see where I'm going with this? "I had only two days of imprintation with you. "You let me discover your lifeless body in a bath of red, lukewarm water." "I didn't know how to be you. I still don't." "I don't like the people you forced me to live with. It makes me depressed." "I want to kill myself, too." But we all know there cannot be doubles of doubles." "And even though I didn't choose to be made, I don't want to let anyone down like you did." "Best... Larry." [ Clapping ] "Most people would look down upon what we had, but it was better than anything they will ever know. We knew each other intrinsically. Better than if you knew someone else an entire lifetime. I still miss your touch. I'm sorry you had to die." [ Clapping ] SARAH'S DOUBLE: I would like to go next. "Sarah..." SARAH: What you said in there, I'm still at a loss. I mean, the way you eloquently accepted all the blame. The way you effectively argued that the real enemy isn't each other. It's a system that arbitrarily decides only one of us can live and that has us fight to the death as some sort of sick spectator sport. I'm sure you wrote something similar in your letter. Maybe you'll read it for me someday. Yeah. And you're right, we actually have a lot in common. A lot, like being good at swimming, and we both have great breasts. Exactly. Why should one of us have to die? Why can't we be together? I'm not saying we should fuck like that one guy in there obviously did with his double, but why can't we both live? Do you mean that? ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ I'm glad you know how to drive. I never learned. It seems easy enough, though. You just press forward on the right one, and you stop by pulling it back. No, you press the pedal to the left of it to brake. Huh. That makes sense. And you change directions with that round thing. Turning it to the right makes the car go right, and turning it to the left makes it go left. See. Easy enough. [ Birds chirping ] [ Zipping ] Comfortable clothing? -Check. -Backpacks? Yours is smaller than I was expecting. I have everything I need. SARAH: Check. -No weapons? -None. I didn't bring any either. If it's all right with you, I'd like to make sure you didn't bring any. I don't want to do it here on the side of the road. Maybe when we take our first break? That's fine with me. I'd like to check your pack, too, for peace of mind. Of course. Rations, check. And water. Yes, last on the list is water. I have it. Check. Let's drink some before we begin walking. I don't think I have to remind you of the importance of staying hydrated. Let's take another bigger drink just to be safe.

One of the combatants in a duel has failed to show up before out of fear, but they're almost always later found and arrested. Some try to get plastic surgery in order to look different, but I found out from Trent that once we're a part of the replacement program, any attempts to contact a plastic surgeon are flagged. There's always the black-market, though, but you are taking a big risk getting a black-market face transplant. As far as I know, there has never been a duel where both the original and the double are no-shows. They'll send dogs after us. But we'll be across the border by then. Once we cross the border, we'll be safe. I'm incredibly thankful you came and found me. And to think, just a few weeks ago, I wanted you dead. I'm so glad we're both in such good shape. We would have needed many more rests already had we not been training this past year. Yes. I agree. [ Eerie soundscape ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] Sorry I'm late. WOMAN: Which one are you?

I'm fine. Should we begin? We can't start yet. Why not? WOMAN: Because your double isn't here. Really? Actually, that sounds just like her. She didn't take this duel very seriously. I bet she hasn't even been training for it. You should probably let your superiors know. She's likely trying to flee. [ Cellphone ringing ] WOMAN: Yes? I'm afraid not, ma'am. Just the original. I have reason to believe this is a code negative one. [ Dramatic music ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ And do you, sir, swear that, to the best of your knowledge, having known her emotionally and intimately, that this is the original Sarah? I do. And do you swear beyond the shadow of any reasonable doubt that the person before us today is the daughter that gestated inside you for nine months and you raised for 18 years, your own flesh and blood? This is my Sarah, Your Honor. And, finally, do you solemnly swear that you are who you say you are? I'm Sarah. I think I have a new wrinkle and two new sunspots. PETER: I'm sure you don't. I can count, Peter. There's exactly one new wrinkle on my face and two new sunspots. PETER: Well, you have to start using sunscreen. And not just when you're going to the beach or when you're walking around a theme park. It has to be daily. Your skin is more sensitive than others'. And you have to start taking better care of yourself. I don't mean to sound insensitive, but... it's only going to get a lot harder from here. As long as men take moderate care of themselves, they tend to peak later in life. Women, on the other hand, have a much smaller window in which they're deemed to be at their peak attractiveness. And don't worry, sweetheart, I'm gonna love you no matter how you look, even with that genetic mutation that causes premature graying and hair loss. Should I buy more hair dye for you while I'm out? No, I'll get some on my way home from work. Remember to keep making at least the minimum payment on the replacement loan. I know, Peter. Where should we go for dinner tonight? How about Mexican food? I don't like Mexican food. [ Cellphone ringing ] Aren't you going to answer that? [ Ringing continues ] She's my mom, not yours. -[ Phone beeping ] -[ Car sputtering ] MOTHER: Hi, Sarah. This is your mother just calling to talk. I must have just missed you. You're probably just walking out the door of your house... ...getting into your car, ready to start another day at your job, which you love. I just wanted you to know, I went ahead and ordered another box of contacts from the optometrist. The colored ones aren't always in stock, so it's best to order ahead of time. I know you're still getting settled back into your life, so I figured something as simple as new contacts might slip through the cracks. I'll call you when you get off work so we can plan a brunch for this weekend. I love you.
