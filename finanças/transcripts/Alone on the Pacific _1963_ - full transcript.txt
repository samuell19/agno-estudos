MAY 12TH 1962 NISHINOMIYA HARBOUR Under Japanese law, no small craft was allowed to leave the country. The only way to do it... ...was in secret. Hey, you're really going, no matter what? Forgive me. Let's go. - Not a word to anyone about this. - You don't need to tell me that. I don't want to make any trouble for you two. Give it a week, then if anyone asks, just say I've gone. Now I was totally alone. I wasn't afraid... I felt good. For five years, I'd been dreaming of this and now I was setting off. My greatest fear was being caught In Japanese waters and forced back. Those two had probably gone home. All I wanted was to put Japan behind me, yet there was no wind! 10:00 pm. At last I had left Nishinomlya Harbour. 1 hour 20 minutes to get to the breakwater. Just 500 metres! Slower than swimming! Dawn arrived and still not the slightest breath of wind. I was still in sight of the Nishinomlya lighthouse, and it was really starting to get on my nerves. Hey, is that yacht down there the same one we saw this morning? What the hell's he doing? Just bobbing along in the same place all day. He's in no hurry. Yachts run on the wind, so what's the point of fitting engines to them? I built my yacht so that it couldn't take an engine. Divine retribution for being so awkward. As long as there was no wind, there was absolutely nothing I could do. Even by nightfall, I was still in the middle of Osaka Bay. I hadn't fitted any lights, so I hung a lantern to warn any other boats that might collide with me. But I was scared of getting caught, so I was constantly hiding it every time a boat drew near! What a palaver! I'd been manning the rudder 24 hours and was exhausted and frozen. My feet were wet in the long boots, but I just slept in the clothes I stood in. I left the lantern burning. As long as the authoritles didn't find my food supplies, they wouldn't suspect anything. I'm drifting eastwards. 11:00? Right, then. I'll catch up on my sleep. Wind! A northerly wind. Let's go! Thank you! Thank you! I'd counted on reaching the southern straits of Tomoga Island within 10 hours. Now I was seeing them, 39 hours into my voyage! ...a south-southeasterly wind. Wind velocity: 6. Rain. 1002 millibars. Temperature: 21 degrees. For Tori Island... Rain. 1000 millibars. 24 degrees. At Hachijo Island, a south-easterly wind... ...1003 millibars. 28 degrees... I was right, it's safer having no light. Too many patrol boats in these waters. Thank goodness for the storm! But really I was praying that somebody would come and rescue me! Listen, I'm not telling you your business because you're the expert, but this keel seems a little shaky. Why don't you just wait until I've finished it? - it's a bit loose. - Any complaints, speak to the guv'nor. The Kingfisher hull is small but it's superbly designed. These are the blueprints I bought in Yokohama for 10,000 yen. It's no good if you don't follow the blueprints! I am following the blueprints to the letter. I've never heard of lauan-wood masts. I promised you a hull for 200,000 yen, so a lauan-wood mast will have to do. You're the one who came up with the figure of 200,000 yen! I can't give you a penny more so please be fair with me. You're always chopping and changing. If you don't trust us, come in every day and supervise it. I will, then! Just look... it's seeping in from all directions. Is there a single join that's safe? Hey, look... there are gaps everywhere. Every day I have to put up with this... Enough! If you're only using 9-mm thick veneer, you've got to make sure it's a tight fit. Boats absorb water when they're afloat. Wood expands when it's in water. I don't relish having to bail out bilge water from the ship's hull. In a rocking boat, puking my guts up... Give me some room, I can't do my work. If a yacht takes on too much water, then it'll sink, simple as that. I guarantee the boat'll be fine in the Seto Inland Sea. As long as you bail out water faster than it comes in, the boat won't sink. Nine days into my voyage now. Seems I've been drifting aimlessly in the seas around Shizuoka. I'm halfway through my schedule already. I allowed for being delayed near the Japanese coast, but this was too much! It rained almost non-stop every day, and pressure dropped in stormy seas. What's the rest of the voyage going to be like? Serves you right, leaving the country without permission! Think bad thoughts and you'll be sent back home! I don't care. Go ahead! Japan is such a closed country. I was fully prepared and confident in my skills, but you wouldn't let me go. But the law is the law! It only allows things which are safe. But nothing is totally safe. Even battleships sink. I started this and I'll see it through! I'll keep a watchful eye out! I have to say, right, that you and me are the same person. Can I trust you? Just leave it to me! Really? You'll soon leave Japan behind you. Stop weeping and start singing! OK... "Reef"? What's that? Dictionary, dictionary... "Hidden reef, shore reef..." "To run aground on a reef." That's something I'd better avoid. "I shall walk with my head held high" "So my tears won't fall..." I discovered that crying can help to maintain mental wellbeing. It feels good having a cry. You can bawl your eyes out, no one's looking. I wept as though I was utterly alone in this world. If I say I'm not going, I won't go. Where the hell is it? It should be put back where it belongs. - Listen, Dad... - Go and ask your mother! Mum just tells me to talk to you. I'm just going round in circles. This is where it's been left! Anyway, I've decided I'm not going to university, but it'd make me feel better if I had your consent, Dad. - Only because you want to go sailing! - Guess so. Anyway, why can't you do both? That's what you've been doing so far. I'll pay your tuition fees for you whatever happens. Even if I wanted to go to university, I'd find a way of paying for myself. Anyhow, I hate studying! - I didn't even want to go to high school. - You can't sail yachts all your life! - I'll work. - Where? Here. I can work with you, Dad. I don't want you to get into this business. Go back to school. Doing the same as everyone else doesn't interest me. Work isn't supposed to "interest" you, you stubborn fool! You're the stubborn one! Why do you say that? I'm always easy-going, everybody'll tell you that. You're going to university! No way! I'm just popping out. Have you finished that work for Okazaki? Not quite, but Yoshi said he'd finish it off. - Off to Nishinomiya again? - That's right. Your mother tells me you have a yacht now. A mate invited me into part ownership with nine other guys, so I own one tenth of the yacht. A mate? What does he do for a living? Runs a clothes shop, a shoe shop, a flower shop... This and that. So the yacht's his pastime? He must be rolling in it, eh? He's not rolling in it at all, that's why he asked me. It's 100,000 yen per person to be paid in monthly instalments. Since I earn only 10,000 a month, it's pretty tight! 10,000 yen? I'm paying you too much! I'll have to get you working harder. You said you didn't want me working at the yard. You came here of your own free will. I never said that! I don't want to inherit this place off you. I'm just hanging around here so you'll get rid of me. Good-for-nothing! I'm 20 years old now. I can take care of myself now. If you did your job properly, I wouldn't have to discipline the others. Just tell them to ignore me and get on with it. I'm off! What? Something you want to talk about? So you're leaving and going to work somewhere else for a year? - I was going to talk to you about it... - What's to talk about? You've decided. If it was a regular job, fine, but it's only for a year! - I don't want to be an office worker. - And after a year, then what? A mate put a good word in for me, the salary's three times what I get here. It's a travel agency, providing services for tourists travelling by boat or plane. I'll be a driver, taking passengers' baggage to the airport. You'll upset your mother even more. Why? You tried to hide it from her, but she realised all along that all you want to do is sail off in your yacht. Hanako said as much... "The only books my brother reads are ones about the sea, "about circumnavigating the globe and diaries of castaways." What does Hana-chan know? They're only books. It's only natural for someone as wilful as you to run off to sea! Don't be so hard on me! You understand what it's like, Dad. Pushing and shoving through life, trying to survive. To test yourself and your capabilities, that's the best feeling, isn't it? You don't have to go to sea for that! I never said that. I don't even have my own yacht. I know you well enough, you'll build one. I expressly forbid it! I want you to give it up. You're my only son. - You're too suspicious! - Disobey me, and I'll cut you off! Well, there's nothing I can do about that. That's Tateyama? So, if Tateyama's at exactly zero... Precisely north! That's north, so... zero, zero, zero... 180. All right! I'm good! So if my current position is here and I maintain a course due south, then I should pass between Hachijo Island and Mikura Island. After that, I hit the Pacific Ocean! What a great device you are! Good job I insisted on getting one. With all those reefs around the Izu Archipelago, you better show me you're worth the 57,000 yen I spent on you! I'm relying on you. On the front starboard side, we have the moon. In the heavens, we have the Plough, and at the side, the Pole Star. With my right hand on the rudder and my left holding some cheese, I listened to music on the radio. I passed through the Izu Islands safely. I won't forget that sense of satisfaction at my achievement. ...133 degrees 45 minutes of east longitude. 985 millibars, a category-3 typhoon, 15 kilometres northeast... It's hot but it's great weather! Just once... I'd love to sail in a typhoon. Me and my big mouth, talking about typhoons! Now it's following me! With such a large hole in the boat, you have to drop the price when the time comes to sell! Enough is enough! If you're facing certain death, call out to me! Hail to the Mystic Law of the Lotus Sutra! There as well? When you first started sailing, you did nothing but complain. You were so tired when you got back from school sailing trips, you just slept. I wish you'd given up sailing then. Listen, it's not that much fun even now, with all the research I have to do in preparation for this crossing. The stress is making me sick. So why don't you consider giving it up? You have no real friends to speak of, and I appreciate how much this yacht means to you. I have Pearl. Pearl? She's just a dog! I told you, don't worry. My yacht's been specially designed to right itself from a 130-degree lean. - I'm home. - How come you're back so early? Well, it's a holiday. - Is today Sunday? - Wednesday. - A holiday on a Wednesday? - I don't know! Nice to be so out of it! They're so easy-going at that dressmaking college of hers. I'm talking about Hana-chan. She goes into classes not knowing it's a day off! - Must be expensive, that yacht. - Very expensive. You managed to save up for it. - I've been scrimping and saving. - What scrimping and saving? You can save enough from your salary, but when it comes to shoes and shirts, I have to buy them for you! You don't have to pay board and lodging in this house! Please, Mum, no more ear-bashing! First you quit the travel agents, then spend every day down at the boatyard building a yacht! Is there nobody that can talk you out of this crazy idea? I'll be furious if you discuss my plan with anyone else! Yes, but... I couldn't bear it if you got angry and left home. Maybe I should go and talk to your friends. Don't you dare! Even my friends have been saying the same thing lately... "Don't mention crossing the Pacific to Horie, "because the more you try to dissuade him, the more he'll want to go." Yes, but... ...you'll still go, even if I say nothing. What are you after, my dear? I'm sure I bought some tobacco... but I can't find it anywhere. Your father won't even discuss the matter with you. I know. it's the same with my friends. Is there no way of stopping you? It's because you have no girlfriend. If you had, she'd soon stop you in your tracks! Thanks for the food! Don't be so daft, Mum, I don't need a girlfriend. And what money I do have, I spend it on the yacht. So stop worrying! I'm not going anywhere till I'm totally confident. How about going with a friend? You, who can't stand being alone, how can you spend all that time by yourself at sea? Day in day out, seeing the same person, even a lover, in a tiny boat... - it'd end in tears. Alone is best. - You're just saying that out of pride. Mum! A couple of months without company, I'm bound to get lonely. It can't be helped. Listen, it's tough luck if you don't want me to go. I've made my mind up, I'm going! You can't stop me! I'll let you know when I'm leaving, but if you keep nagging me, then I'll just leave in secret! - Off to the boatyard? - Yeah. Ken-chan... If you're caught in a storm and facing certain death, call out to me. The wind's changed. I should get cracking. I've had enough of working all day. Now it's your turn. Don't just sit there, you lazy bastard! Why don't you get out there? Weird! Is that the first sign I'm going mad? Right, I'll do it myself! There's no one but me on this boat. No one but me! Only ten bags left. One bag is 3 litres, so that makes 30 litres. This amount of water should just about last two months. Plus 12 litres in cans... No worries, eh? No way! Only three good ones. There was no problem when I tried them out at home. I left water in plastic bags for a year and there was nothing wrong with it! It didn't go murky like this! Never mind! Never mind! I've got loads of canned fruit. The juice in them is just like water. And there's rainwater! If I can catch it, I can drink that. However much I tried to laugh it off, it was no good. It felt like I was caught in a vicious circle. It wasn't just the loneliness. There was the exhaustion, cold, lack of sleep and anxiety. I felt I was losing my sanity. As I wasn't taking in any water, I drank a little alcohol to quench my thirst. I deliberately started mixing my drinks. I thought getting blind drunk would help me. The physical pain would ease my psychological pain, right? I feel awful! Oh, that hurts! That's the lot. Do you know the easiest way to travel abroad? Air travel's got to be the easiest. - I mean in terms of procedure. - Procedure? - Know anyone who specialises in it? - Nah. Isn't that your company's speciality? Only for legitimate clients. FOREIGN AFFAIRS SECTION Could you help me, please? - This won't do. - Won't do? You're missing one document. Fill it in and return it. These are the forms I got from a travel agency where I worked. I see... How many days does it take to get a passport? You only require an ID card to go to Okinawa. But I need a document from you that proves my Japanese nationality. You'll be notified within four to five weeks to come and pick it up. That long? Okinawa's under US military jurisdiction. - Do you do a background check? - How should I know? All we do is pass on your application to the Southern Region General Office. So there's no way I can go to America with my ID card, right? America? The counter for passport applications is over there. What's up? No one'll come near me lately. At least it's better than being criticised by everyone. I'm told Shikishima Cotton will give you free sails. Really? The only condition is that you display their trademark on the sail. It's like this, in the shape of a mermaid. I heard you were hard up for money, so... Not exactly hard up, but the yacht has cost me 70,000 yen more than I budgeted. Ask them if I can change the boat's name to Mermaid. You sure you don't mind advertising their brand? They're not likely to find that many customers in the middle of the Pacific! There's a University Sailing Club alumni meeting in May. I wanted to make it a send-off party, but many members were against it. That's all right, who cares? I might not even be in Japan by then. There's no need to be so arrogant when you're talking to me. Sorry... You're my senior, and I spoke out of turn. It's nothing to do with all that "senior/junior" nonsense. What you are is a maverick. You always do exactly what you want, and you do it your way. There's nothing wrong with that. When you're the only one you can trust, you have to believe in yourself. Having said that, in order to protect all that's important to you, surely you have to treat those around you with respect. I mean, you might not see eye to eye with everyone, but they're still your friends and family, right? You are one man, and they are many. If they really want to, they can come down on you like a ton of bricks! I've said too much. Forgive me. No, I'm not bothered at all. You don't get it, do you? You should be bothered! Listen, it's nothing to do with us if you survive or die in the Pacific, but just consider the position you're putting everyone in. It's almost like you want to die out there. I realise that, too! Total distance in a straight line is 5300 miles... ...adding on a third makes 7000 miles. At the Mermaid's average speed of approximately 2 to 3 knots... ...that's 60 days minimum, 120 days maximum. So, 0.5 litres multiplied by 120... ...makes 60 litres. 60 LITRES OF DRINKING WATER, 30 BREAD ROLLS 5 BOXES OF CRACKERS, 5 KG OF HAM Canned goods will be the staff of life, whatever they taste like! 276 CANNED GOODS 2.5 cups of rice per day multiplied by 120 days... I've put each portion in a plastic bag, for convenience. 50 PACKETS OF MISO SOUP, 6 FLASKS OF SOY SAUCE 1 MEDIUM BOTTLE OF KETCHUP, 1 LARGE BOTTLE OF MAYONNAISE 5 BOXES OF SALT, 10 PACKS OF CHEWING GUM I love sweet things so I'll pack plenty. 10 BARS OF CHOCOLATE, 3 BOXES OF BISCUITS 2 CANS OF INSTANT CREAM, 1 TIN OF TEA The onboard kerosene stove always stays horizontal. I looked for a foreign-made stove with a flame guard but couldn't find one. And I had a whistling kettle specially made, so I can hear it when I'm above deck. Tin-openers: essential kit! 1 THERMOS FLASK, 5 SPOONS, 6 FORKS I tried to source as much as I could from home. Even so, I was still well over budget. 1 CHOPPING BOARD, 1 CLEAVER 60 BOXES OF MATCHES The red mermaid trademark was too easily spotted, so I took it off. 1 MAIN SAIL, 1 STORM JIB, 1 CRUISING JIB, 1 COMPASS There was a second-hand, British-made sextant I really needed. It was 35,000 yen, but, after an hour, I bartered it down to 25,000 yen. 1 ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE GAUGE 1 DIRECTION FINDER 1 TRANSISTOR RADIO, 7 RADIO BATTERIES, 4 LAMPS I'd use my life jacket as a pillow. 40 LITRES OF PARAFFIN, 6 BUCKETS Two large buckets I used for collecting rainwater, four medium buckets for bailing, and I tied a red ribbon on the toilet bucket! 12 NAUTICAL CHARTS, 1 CONSTELLATION CHART 1 BOOK ON BEACONS, 1 SET OF WATERPROOF CLOTHING 5 STRAW HATS, 1 BASEBALL CAP Exposure to direct sunlight causes exhaustion, so five cheap straw hats. I need that many because they'll get blown into the sea. 15 T-SHIRTS, 5 PAIRS OF TROUSERS, 7 SWEATERS I bought 60 undershirts a few at a time. 80 pairs of cheap shorts, which I'd throw away after wearing. 12 PAIRS OF GLOVES, 3 SCARVES, 3 BELTS, 10 PAIRS OF SOCKS There was mountains of stuff! I couldn't risk having an overloaded boat in a storm. There was no end of things to worry about. I took care not to go over the maximum load of 500 kg. 1 MIRROR, 1 TUBE OF HAIR CREAM, 1 HAIR BRUSH Also, a pair of tweezers in case I got any splinters. And toilet paper: 1 batch, 1000 sheets. Tons of the stuff! But best take it all, just in case. 12 PENCILS, 10 BALL-POINT PENS, 1 PENCIL SHARPENER, 2 RUBBERS I needed so many books, for reference and for entertainment. And I needed cushions as I'd be sleeping on a board. They were so expensive! 4 BLANKETS, 1 JAR OF VITAMIN C, STOMACH AND HEADACHE PILLS Seasickness tablets are bad for the stomach, so I planned not to take any. 2 PACKS OF EYE DROPS, 1 TIN OF MENTHOLATUM 1 ROLL OF BANDAGE, 1 PACK OF GAUZE I needed a calendar I could tear off, otherwise I'd lose track. And there was a proverb for every day. It was easy to check, and I could use old sheets to blow my nose. It would spur me on! 2 CHISELS, 1 DIVER'S KNIFE, 3 TYPES OF SCREWDRIVERS 3 DRILLS, 1 MONKEY WRENCH, 2 FILES, 1 BOX OF NAILS 1 SET OF NEEDLES, 50 WOOD SCREWS 1 ROLL OF SELLOTAPE, 1 TAPE MEASURE, 1 WHETSTONE 1 CAMERA, 3 ROLLS OF FILM, 2 UMBRELLAS 1 SET OF FISHING TACKLE, 1 UKULELE A shark! If I'd bumped into that, that would've been end of story! You pulled me away just in time! I thank you. I'll look after you. Simple as that! A real flush toilet. Simple as that! I'll have to do it in black ink as I don't have any red... sorry! I can always see the positive side. Right, let's go for it! If I could sail at this speed every day, I'd get to America in 50 days! Fly with the wind! The water of the Pacific Ocean, even on sunny days, is a cold blackish blue. That's because it's so deep and absorbs the light. The boat caught the waves and sped along. Yachts are so powerful. With her sailing in the wind like this, I felt a renewed sense of trust. The ocean's so wide. People say that it's a small world, but I can feel the true immenslty of nature. What a joy! Glad I came! On the 41st day, I crossed the International date llne. I had covered three sevenths of the distance. I was smack in the middle of the Pacific Ocean! Probably thought I was in distress. Don't worry about me! Just go back to where you came from! Oh, no... they can't hear me. If I wave at them, they might think I'm asking for help. Oh, yeah! My camera! No rush, there's plenty of time. Just look as if I'm leisurely taking photos. Doesn't matter if they don't come out. 1000 kilometres due south of here is the Mldway Sea. Exactly 20 years ago in June, many sailors lost their lives in the immense naval battle there. No one there now. I offered them a silent prayer. Another plane. I suddenly felt nervous. These planes must be keeping me under surveillance. Maybe they thought I was spying on American territorial waters. But America was still far away. It'll be dark soon, then I can sail off out of sight. This is "Pineapple Time" on Radio KI KI, Hawaii, brought to you by the Shima Transfer Company from Honolulu, Hawaii. It's Japan's hit parade, so let's kick off with Murata Hideo's "Champion of Go". If the wind blows, my go piece will fly away You may laugh at the years I've devoted to go But the 808 bridges of old Osaka where I was born... If I substituted "my yacht" for "go", this could be my song! "If the wind blows, my little yacht will float away "And you may laugh at the years I have devoted to it..." The proverb for July 13th... "Whatever your aspirations, "they will amount to nothing if you lack stamina and spirit." Good morning. It's morning once again, eh? An American ship... Fancy meeting you here. Keep your cool! Carry on as you were. They're not going to arrest me. Maybe my pronunciation's no good. Oh, food supplies. Do I look like a beggar? Could I have got this far without my own supplies? I wish they'd get going. What? Am I all right? Bet he won't understand my Japanese. I'm all right! Time to take my leave... Take care! Thank you! Ta! Cheers! Thanks! Passport? Why did she have to bring that up? Thanks for reminding me of something else to worry about! Thanks for your kindness! Bye! There'd been no rain for quite a while, so I boiled my rice in beer, to conserve water. INSTANT CREAM BUTTER How is it? Pretty tasty, eh? I'd kill for some real shortcake. This stuff tastes awful! I'll just have to lump it. Hmm... tastes good! Doesn't really, though. Good, good. Tastes good, right? How is it? Good, eh? Well... I guess... it's kind of tasty. Right? You're lucky to be eating such delicious food. Tasty! At least I took meals seriously! Eating was relaxation for me. I had to work so hard, I didn't have a moment to relax. I was plagued by a sense of unease. And I ate to forget my anxiety, and so overate and made myself ill. And then, the wind dropped. In the Pacific Ocean, when the wind blows, it really blows, and when it doesn't blow, it's absolutely calm. After a week of being becalmed, I started to go slightly mad. When I leapt into the ocean, ...the boat would edge forward slightly. Maybe I could leg-kick all the way! If I kept going back and forth, shoving it like a swing, the boat would be pushed forwards. I thought seriously of giving it a go, as nobody was watching me... But I looked like an idiot, so I just gave up on it. I wonder if I'll ever reach America. There was a cold current, so the temperature dropped. That meant I wasn't far from land. I was scared of landing. I wouldn't know anybody, and I had no passport. I had no money, and I couldn't speak the language. You couldn't have chosen a worse day to leave in this rain. And while your father's away in Tokyo on business, too. It's better that way. Your father will be so angry with me. It'll soon be too late. If I leave it another day, the weather will be worse. You will come back? - Don't worry. - Yes, but... Provided I arrive safely, I'll either be chased away, or thrown into a detention centre. What? All this effort just to get thrown into a detention centre? No, no, it's just something that might happen. Please, give up this stupid trip. Others have made solo crossings of the Pacific Ocean, but no one from Japan yet. Somebody will, sooner or later. There's no reason for you to do it. For a sea-faring nation, Japan's pretty pathetic. So nobody will be impressed, anyway. All that effort, just to get thrown into jail! Mother, it won't be jail. He said it'll be a detention centre. All I want is to cross the Pacific. I don't care if they arrest me. It's not like they'll kill me or anything. I'll be fine. I'll sell the yacht and buy a ticket back home. - Do you have any money? - Yeah... I've got 2000 yen. 1000 YEN NOTE Well, I still have a few things to get... so I'll take it. I should return within 120 days... So you mustn't worry about me. I made it for you to take with you. You should've given it to me earlier, then I wouldn't have had to buy any. Anyway, thanks so much. It's beautiful. Isn't it, Mum? I've carefully researched everything that I possibly can. I'll just have to face what Fate throws at me. Land! It's America! Have I really made it? There was San Francisco, right before my eyes. I imagined so many thoughts would come into my head, but my mind was a blank. Around here, the currents are strong. The seabed has tricky contours. If I wasn't careful, I'd come to grief. Other vessels were coming and going... so, safety first! I kept watch outside the harbour all through the night. It was cold... and I was tired. I changed my underwear and had a shave. And then, in the morning, there it was, the Golden Gate Bridge. And under the bridge and beyond was San Francisco Harbour! Mother! I made it! AUGUST 12TH 1962 SAN FRANCISCO You're all speaking English! I don't understand! This is really America! San Francisco! I made it! I reached America! For 94 days I'd been at sea, and my legs were unsteady. It felt strange being on solid ground. The Japanese Consul came to meet me and put me in his car. I was so worried... Exactly six days after my son departed, his pet dog gave birth to a litter of five puppies. Taking care of the puppies took my mind off worrying about my son. His friends were so anxious, that they launched a search for him four days ago. Then I started to worry and worry... Really... I am just so grateful that he's alive. Sir, you were against your son's trip. You must be happy now, though? When we get him home, I'll make sure he apologises to everyone. Never again will I let him do such a thing. How does his sister feel? I knew from the very start that my brother would be all right. We don't have any details just yet. That's right, he did it alone. - Somebody get the door! - I'll go! Horie Kenichi, from Osaka... Osaka! Can you hear me? So far, I seem to have been welcomed as an object of curiosity. I think this house belongs to someone who works at the Japanese Consulate. I think they'll let me stay here for the night. I've no idea what will happen tomorrow, but at least I'm not in a detention centre. For that, I'm thankful. I finished what I set out to do. I'm tired. I really need some sleep. Hello? I'll leave some pyjamas here for you! Wow! What a sight! How embarrassing! I'd best wipe it with this. Must be a whole layer of my skin! Horie-san, telephone for you! An international call, from Japan! I think it's your family on the line! Right... I'm coming now... Coming... THE END
