Ted offered you a drink. Oh my God, did you actually do it? Yes. Do you always do the same thing? Well babe, remember my first drink? Are you okay? Yeah. Are you okay? I mean I'd be stumbling too if I had to wear those heels. We're gonna go. Whoa, hey, oh God. Look why don't we just find somewhere for you to lie down, how about that? Come with me. Stan, get down here it's important! Is everything okay, is your concussion acting up again? Everything is in a word, bodacious. I'm Tindering this town to Dante's second, third, and fourth dimensions of hell. So this self proclaimed stud on my emerging markets team tried to talk me into Bumble, last week he had four matches, each described herself as administrative assistant. And so I asked him what kind of assistant to what kind of administration is that? Turns out they were all hookers. Of course, sexual entrepreneurship's a booming business in the VC space. So he messaged them all saying what's up? And they replied with a link and it wasn't to a Facebook page, it was to a Fuckbook page. What's up, who says that, I mean besides you? I didn't come to Gotham to pay for herpes alright, when it's free as air in West Virginia. Oh please a V is a V. And HIV is HIV. Yeah but if everyone has AIDS then no one has AIDS right? In other news, I am meeting up with a girl named Tiffany tonight. Tiffany, that sounds very promising. Can I go back to my room now please? I get about an hour a month to write, honestly. No, you live under my roof, that means you follow my rules, you're coming with. Oh oops, I'm not dressed appropriately, looks like you're gonna have to go without me, it's okay. - No, no, no. - No, no, no, no. You're not doing this again, okay? Nine months ago because I felt sorry for you and your prevential ass, I let you move into this place. And the only time that you've come out with me was alumni weekend, and I remember you had fun. You may not think that you had fun, but I remember, you had fun. That was your definition of fun? Because if I remember correctly you guys vanished on me after an hour, I had to spend 60 bucks on the campus bus driver to take me back to the Motel 6, which was awful, so I think your friends suck, no offense though. No offense, please, no offense taken. My friends do suck but at least they're interesting. What about you huh? Big writer, tell me something, what are you writing about? You don't do anything. All you do is sit back there in that closet of yours. Closet you put me in. God. I'm gonna ask it, who's the girl, who's Tiffany? She is an assistant, in what else? Marketing. Women's work, 21st century update of stitching quilts. I work at like a app yeah, and like our office looks straight down at Diane von Furstenberg which is like amazing, obviously, the coolest. Let me tell you something, on your dates if you actually asked these girls questions other than which room at the Metropolitan Club they wanna get married in, you'd learn pretty quickly that they're a lot smarter than you are. Metropolitan Club, look at you! The point is I understand dating apps and I retain the perfect profile because of it. For instance, here's a photo of me with an African child. Oh, I didn't know you went to Africa? I didn't, that's my maid's kid. Oh, so you're a fraud and a liar, that's nice. What do you have to offer, huh, big shot? You and your toothy grin on your family farm, All American Gothic, holding a giant scissors. It's called a scythe. Whatever, if dating apps were repining mothers you'd kill it, the problem is I'm a Chad, you're a Stanley. Hey don't call me Stanley, please, I've told you! Girls they see your name and they immediately think of a guy in a white button down who wants to talk about his favorite evangelist, it's not sexy. While you're trying to triangulate your Facebook link to multi-ethnic trimber within 10 blocks I bet you I can discover a girl worthy of our attention before you and do it the old fashion way. Yeah, no apps, no Rwandan huskies, you know just me being me, Guinness Book of World Record's, Greatest Guy of All Time. You're on. No. Yes! No, no, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, you Mr. Writer, Stan, you are a writer, you need to have an experience. This will be an experience, have this experience. And if you come I'll have Tiffany bring her. Guinness Book of World's Record, Greatest Girl. Fine, fine, I'll get changed, how 'bout that? Yes! This is gonna be the greatest night of your life, I promise. And please just put those jeans on that I got you for your birthday, they make your ass look great. Oh God, please don't do that again. 10 minutes! God I hate Union Square. Leave the Upper East Side to come to this bridge and tunnel shit hole, it'd be great if you're a dental assistant from Nayack. We're gonna end up going downtown anyway. Why not just commit, go all the way downtown? It's just a quick six down. Please don't ever say that again. Trey, my boy! Chadwick! Get over here. Come here you. - Tickle, tickle, tickle. - Tickle, tickle, tickle. Boy you are a stud. What's up man? Good to see you buddy, hey good to see ya. Good to see you too. I haven't touched my hair. Let's get you caught up, yeah let's take some shots. Paige got us a table at Up and Down so we're gonna get a little more sauced and then head on down there. Sauced, sounds good. Where are your parents? Oh my pops is in Beijing destroying the yuan. For me Chinese currency is all a big yuan. Get it? Mm hmm, no I get it. Oh where are my, this is Maddie, and Paige, lovely humans. Nice to meet you. Hi. Two of my faves. Yeah, very pretty, Trey I love your place, it's fantastic, Thank you, thank you. Especially your deck, it's so big. Oh Stanley, you like my deck? Big, oversized, - oh no not like - I was joking. - Massive deck. Thank you, thank you. A little homosexual Stanley, but you know what? Let's take some shots, get some liquor in the system, there we are. Hard alcohol? Hard alcohol buddy boy, it'll go down smooth, I promise you. Okay. Not as smooth as my deck. Here we are ladies. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hey Cheers. Cheers. Careful there. That's nice, burns the pipe. Alright gentlemen, have a good time. Alright ladies have a good time. Thank you. Excuse me, sorry, hi, we're on the list Adrian knows we're coming. Sorry. - We have a table. - Not on the list. You didn't even ask my name. Can you please tell Adrian that Paige is here? Nah. Why the hell not? 'Cause you got like five guys and five girls and I don't need no more dicks in the club. Don't clubs ever want good looking guys to attract good looking girls, am I right? No, they don't, then I would get in. Hey people, how you doing there? Nice to see you, I'm homeless I got no money. Can you guys do something about it? I even got papers here to prove it, I'm totally homeless. Yeah, yeah, let me guess, you're also a Vietnam Vet. Yeah that's right, what about you? Whoa, hey. You ever been overseas? What the fuck! You ever fought in a war? Buddy, buddy here. And they call me a bum! No thank you you keep it, you're a good guy. I'm sorry. This piece of shit over here, scum bag, - douche bag. - I know he is. He's a scum bag, you're right. - A fucking asshole. - Fuck 'em where they breathe. You know what man I've had enough tonight, I'm leaving, I'm out of here. No, no, no, no, no. I'm leaving man. Stan, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave. Say sorry, say sorry! Sorry Stanley. He's fucking sorry, - It's okay, I just. - He's very sorry. Look, if you come in with me, I'll blow you. You are so weird. Yeah you obviously didn't consider that before you felated me. Oh my God, ew, that was like what, sophomore summer? Yeah well nobody forgets their first Madison Square Park beej, Maddie. Hey fuck this, here buddy. Hey, what, what? Yeah, we're going in, open the fucking rope, let's go! Right welcome. Thank you. Have a good time. - Thank you. - Thank you. Let's get it started! I'll just do like a vodka soda. Thanks. Very festive. So when you're out in the city do you ever feel like you're at a Georgetown reunion or something? What? I was just looking around and I thought that. How would you know I went to Georgetown? I don't know you. I didn't I, okay, well. Where'd you go to school? I went to WVU. What's that mean? It's a university, not like lol. Oh yeah, isn't that like a hospital? Yeah you're right it is, Western Veterans U. Brother college to WHD, Women's House of Detention, great mixers if you know what I mean. You don't? No, that's great. Great time, I'm having a great time. Sorry, thank you. I'm 0 for two. Oh, I'm shocked. Tiffany and her friend are gonna meet us here, hopefully she's whatever it is you like. Oh please we both know the only reason I'm here is to distract her, right? So you and little miss intern can hook up, huh? Jesus, where are they by the way? Women! They're all the same, whether it's the first date or the 50th they never come on time. And who's fault is that Speedy Gonzalez? The problem with our friend Stan here is he's sensitive, he's sweet. He's naive, he's romantic. He doesn't realize there's a precedent in place. Right? Party hard in college, work pre Emancipation Proclamation hours for four years at a big bank. Then you go to a hedge fund where you're massa of the plantation. Then at 32 find some desperate 27 year old who realizes her last five years at B.B.D. & O were a giant waste of time and all she wants is a ring, your parents place in Florida, and your fucking sperm. You know what? Before you know it all the marry-able women will be taken, and you'll be left sitting at you desk with a terminal case of quantitative easing. Woo! You should've been a writer. Chad, hi. Hey - Tiffany. - Tiffany. - Nice to meet you. Hey. Hi. You wanna get in. Hi. Hi. You can sit here. - Thank you. - Thanks. Hey how you doing? Have a drink? Yes. Are you actually texting someone on that? You've learned the ancient feminine trick of the fake text to seem busy, my armor has vanished. Oh no it wasn't aimed at you but why do people do that anyway? They can't stand the idea that someone might see them standing alone. It's kind of like when you're in a elevator with someone now and days, no one has the fortitude to just stand there in silence, or maybe even strike up a conversation, everyone just goes straight to their phones. And guess what? There's no cell service in a elevator of course, so unless you're playing Bejazzle you're lying, right? Well Tiffany, I don't know what the fuck they're talking about but I'm ready to leave, you? Yeah let's go. Okay yeah. That went flawlessly. She's good, he's gonna like her. Have we met before? Good one. Look I better just get this out of the way now. The only reason I came here tonight was to wing Chad. So I figured I'd just clear the air before we get married and have kids, and I tell my parents, this whole thing, so. So this isn't your usual stomping ground is it? You caught me, the Dave and Buster's was on the right and I turned left, but I definitely would not of picked this place. Right, 'cause you prefer some place more quiet and intimate. Absolutely anywhere but here, yeah. I know of somewhere we can go. Okay here we go this extra step. Wow. ♪ I don't like fellas who get too pushy ♪ ♪ Who try to move me and pursue me much too quick ♪ ♪ I need a little time to know you if we're gonna click ♪ ♪ Please, please don't rush me ♪ How? Isn't it cute in here? Very pink, my grandma would love it. You should bring her here next time. Hi. - Thank you. - Thank you. Wow these drinks are Yankees puns, that's amazing. They are. Have you decided? He'll have a Murderer's Row, and I'll have a Bambino. Thank you. I just realized I don't know your name. Oh my god, you don't, my name is Stan. Nice to meet you, what's your name. You too, I'm Caroline. Caroline, that's a great name. But it's a deal breaker I can't go out with any Carolines, it's crazy. Oh God, should I leave? I'm teasing, I'm teasing, I'm teasing, stay please. If you twist my arm. So what do you and your friend do? Chad, he crunches numbers and much to my chagrin so do I. You don't strike me as a finance guy. Well I'm not, I'm not, but I'll admit, and you won't see too many people can see this, but before you file me under douche bag I will admit that I grew up poor, and rural, and I didn't like it. Well that's a first step, what about Chad? Oh what about Chad? Chad came into finance for the same reason all people born rich still go into finance. As Babe Paley once said, "You can never be" "too rich or too thin." Wow, look at you and here I thought I knew every witty quote in the book, but I thought that was Wallis Simpson. Its a common error, they were both very rich and very thin. Touche. - Wow. - Thank you. Look at these gender neutral drinks, these are amazing. Should we cheers? Yeah, cheers. Anyway, Chad's a finance guy because it'll let you talk fast without actually having to sound smart. So you can Uber and eat for free, and in time you love to pay retail, you can finally stop pretending you actually read Moby Dick, and that anyone who did is a loser, and you're not one of those because you have a Black Card and a Brioni suit, you're rich, right? Yeah, so why are you so clearly dissatisfied? Does it show on my face? All over, mm hmm. No I think that we all have baselines and even if you won the Mega Millions jackpot you're eventually going to return to your baseline level of happiness and still make the same fundamental mistakes that you've always made. I don't know. I wanna question you on that. Too cynical for you? A little bit, I'm not so sure about what you just said. Friends. Yes you friends, your reportay has caught our collective ear why don't you come and join us, in fact I insist. Gentle sir knight, what is thy name? Well my name is Kentavious my fair lady. Kentavious. Let's go over there. You wanna go, do you know those people? I like what we're doing right here. No I do too, but let's do something unexpected, let's do something spontaneous, don't worry, we can hold hands. Promise? Come on let's go. Okay. Please. Oh. Evening, I'm Oliver Smithson. I'm Stan, just Stan. Just Caroline. Just indeed, indeed. Maxime, Soo. Well isn't this just about as diverse as the cover of a college admissions pamphlet? But our hearts are as lily white as that of a Massachusetts puritan. And who would the most astringent puritan be? Why Jonathan Edwards but of course. Ah, good choice, Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God, not to be confused with John Kerry's sinful running mate. Who are the angry God and the sinner, you? Or are we the sinners? To address your point Stan. Oh not really point, just a stab at a bad joke to cut the tension. To address your diversity point the debutante era is far behind us now and I for one am grateful to be admitted into a good college. My sainted parents would be so proud of me. While some may think that the diversity fight has been largely fought and won, unbeknownst to you there have been not one, but two nuclear fall outs from their struggles. Does this resonate with you? Oh well more people are speaking up and holding others accountable, and people don't like being held accountable. So then there's the backlash, and you end up with the Alt-Right, the fine moral republic of Twitter. Most people get the first one. What's the second? I see in my mind's eye just such a circular turning of the earth returning to a time where the best like all conviction where the worst are full of passionate intensity. Alright help him out, let's get to the point. Alright then, take dear Kentavious here, how do you feel about judging people you just met Stan? Oh well I. When Kentavious was growing up he was an odd mix of shyness, resentment, and explosiveness. And when he could advert what did he do? He started a Quebec separatist movement in Denver. Well I guess that Kentavious began calling himself a republican in order to neutralize the race issue with his classmates at Amherst? Close, at Whitehall. Bravo Stan. So Stanley what exactly is it that you do? The whole finance thing. Oh, how disappointing I was under the impression that there was gonna be so much more to you than just that. What do you really wanna do? I'd like to be a writer. What kind of writing? Just stuff that I write home alone by myself really. Well you're a writer at a table of readers, so please read for us. Oh, no, no, it's really nothing more. It's writing home about, you know what I'm saying? Maybe later then, so Caroline, what do you do? I'm an assistant curator at the Met. Really? What period? Early 20th Century American, like the American Realists. Well why don't you name a few for us, so we can nod along and reply with a-ha, mm, yes, as if we knew exactly who you was talking about all along. Don't worry about it, honestly other than Hopper it's pretty much overlooked, you barely even learn about it in a survey course. Johnson's History of Art, I bought mine used, every line highlighted in yellow. Well if every line's highlighted no line is highlighted, am I right? We have an appointment that is soon approaching. Here, let's see. I got some ones, some, oh that's my Trip card. Hold on, I swear. Stan, Stan the man, you adorable phenic fox you, what do you think you're doing? Well I was gonna just. No, no, you're our guy, put it away. Thank you. No Oliver, I'm gonna pay for this one. That's very generous of you Kentavious. Mm hmm. You guys are awesome. Hmm. Whoa. Where are we? I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore. Welcome. Thank you. To the night! To the night. Absinthe, and anything else? Champagne cocktails all around my dear miss. A tower of bubbles to the fathomless abyss. Hey, hey, thank you. Nice. Who are you guys, like for real, I don't get it? Come on Stan, drink. Alright, to the night. Good evening, and good morning to all you degenerates of the dark. My name is Marguerite, but you can call me Mom. My slaves shall bountifully pour limited addition liquor. Upon the glass fortress. It is a token of the time we spent in Sir Stan's company. Cheers to Stan. To Stan. Cheers to you. I so wish that the divine intervention that brought us together will be fruitful, it seems like only moments ago that we met, and yet somehow I feel like I know everything about you. To Stan! To Stan! ♪ And her heart beat beat ♪ ♪ Feel her heart ♪ Okay, you're telling me this is our guy? Yeah, it has to be. You need to leave now. Right. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine thank you. Stan read something that you've written for us. No, no, no, I don't have anything on me at the moment. Oh really? Yeah. What's this then? Hey, that's my journal. Alright you read us something out of that journal and Caroline will give you a kiss, won't you Caroline? I'd love to hear something you've written. See? Maybe when I find my voice, I just like to observe what makes the people in my office tick. I just try to describe it, which is no small challenge I assure you, it's like studying plants by going to the Antarctic. Come on please, will you read something for me? Not when you twist my arm like that. I'll just read this thing I wrote about the. C suite execs going down to the boardroom the other Monday. How they would rampage if there were no constraint. If it weren't for their eyes constantly reminding them they would see but themselves in a vacuum. Once mesmerized by Tantalos on the bank, now pulled by Narcissus in the water, room for only one in the boat. Filled with thunderous angst that since their not the leader they would happily kill all until only one was left. We'll the meter is a bit rough. It's very nice. Thank you. You're angst reminds me of someone I know. Kentavious, what do you think? I need to have a word with you. Now. Excuse us for a moment. What are we waiting for? We need to get this interview started now, instead of letting him go back and forth. You kidding me? You believe this guy did it? That's what we're here to figure out. Even if he takes the bait that doesn't prove anything with your sister, okay, this is a terrible idea. No, it's not a idea anymore, this is happening. Please tell me we didn't miss anything too exciting? Caroline, did you fulfill your end of the bargain yet with Stan? No. No yet. Inhale slave, inhale bondsman. Inhale little boy. Try some more for good measure. ♪ Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down ♪ This is the stuff that elevated some of your deceased mentors. Do you know why I brought you here? Hmm? So you're a mute, great. I figured places like this existed, but I never knew for sure. And now that you do, doesn't that excite you? Hold on let me guess, you're not exactly the creative type? No, no, no, I am, I just. I just, I just I haven't taken the creative leap yet! I've heard it 1,000 times Stan, boo hoo, loser. Why hasn't Maxime said anything? We thought it was best to escort her away from all the hubbub. Put her to sleep, almost as if she's had a little too much to drink. Serves her right. She's okay though? Well okay is a broad term, alive yes. Will she live, yes. Is she okay though? Well I'm not sure about that, but she really is something isn't she? I hadn't really formed an opinion of her, I just met her about two hours ago. Two hours ago! You're funny, Maxime liked that about you. She told me 1,000 times, what is it you think you need to take that so called creative leap? That is to be the creative person you think you really are? Experiences like this, as my roommate Chad repeatedly reiterates to me. Oh, your roommate Chad, as if I don't know Chad. How do you know Chad, is he here? What else do you need? I need one motivating idea. One that will hold up under repeated examination. One that will cook, brew and result in a product that has value and will eventually be recognized as beautiful, even if no one knows who wrote it. Oh yes, such a form as Grecian godsmiths make to keep a drowsy emperor awake. What if I told you that I was here to help make that happen? To sort of goose you along? The people at this club are well connected, and here to help you get all that you deserve. But of course you must first pass their test. Wait a minute, what test? Where's Caroline? I don't know a Caroline, Maxime on the other hand I mean look at her, oof. No, no, no, Caroline, Caroline, the woman with the light brown hair sitting next to me at the table. I dream of genie with the light brown hair, only two syllables in genie and Caroline has three. So there is no Caroline, only genie with the light brown hair. Alright guys he's drifting, I need you to keep him focused on Maxime. Doesn't Maxime turn you on? Well she is a beautiful woman. Ooh, what an innocent way to express what you really feel. My mom would love you. Describe what you find beautiful about her. Her lips are so. No not like that, speak as you would in your first best-selling novel. Shh. Where's Caroline? No, Maxime! I don't want verbalized psycho babble I want you to dictate what you want from her right now, go. He doesn't belong here. Sure he does, look at him. This didn't work before, it's not gonna work now. Now we're gonna get down to the truth. Maxime told me that she really liked you. That she was you were with another woman but she wanted you, so why not? She's not going to tell. Caroline's the first thing in New York my parents would be proud of me for. I don't understand, why isn't Stan taking it? Because your method is fucked, it doesn't prove anything, he's not our guy. Yes he is, it's definitely your guy. I remember him, his face, he was there. Fine! We could've had something, and not just you and Maxime, me too, we would've given ourselves to you tonight. No one would've known, you've got one last chance and then I'm gone, or is it that I'm not your type? No. Well that too. I see, you want a submissive bitch who takes it any way you give it to her. Maxime's the very apex of submissive right now, you don't see me jumping at the opportunity. No, you can't stay apex or submissive, because apex means highest or culminating point, and submissive comes from, that means lowering, so you got it wrong. What you meant to say is the optime of submissive, didn't you? Didn't you? I don't. I didn't know why I had been brought there, but I should have. Congratulations Stan. Are you Kentavious' friends? 'Cause he's a swell chap. We were wondering something, amongst ourselves so to speak. Would you happen to be familiar with the name Alison Kane? Who? Who expostulate what majesty should be, but beauty is. Why day is day, and night is night, and time is time but be nothing but to waste night, day, and time. You are charming, but now Stan, please answer the question. I don't know I can kinda see it. I can sort of sense it, the way you all came together. I envisioned Kentavious six years ago on the first day of junior year, I will denote you Nighthawks. I will guess that upon his arrival two years before at the prestigious Whitehall University people didn't know what to make of Kentavious, nor did he. He was an extraordinary musical talent, and I have no doubt that he could've been admitted to Julliard or the New England Conservatory, but he never applied. Lack of confidence perhaps? What does school have to do with anything that I just asked you? I think I know how. Instead Whitehall, a small, elite liberal arts college wood him and there he found himself, with the prospect of law school if the music didn't pan out. In one such seminar on Bartok, Stravinsky, and Schubert taught by his mentor is where he first saw Maxime and Soo. Good morning, I am God. I am informed this is when I am supposed to write my name on the blackboard but forget it, I will not write anything, except maybe a quote or two to show a difficult transition. And close your notebooks they are making me nervous. You will not be writing anything, after all music is about what? Listening. Ah. And then there was you, Oliver Smithson, the most recent I'm guessing in a long line of Smithsons at Whitehall. So, to some up we've uncovered how Stravinsky as a Dumbarton notes Concerto E flat major took so much from Bach's Brandenburg Concerto, yet forces us to look at these in a new way. Bartok and his Concerto for Orchestra takes the classical sonata structure of exposition, development, and recapitulation, yet fills his form with traditional Hungarian folk music. And again forces us to a new recognition. And that was the theme of class, forcing recognition. I don't know about you but I did not hear the Brandenburgs in that Dumbarton at all. What? Kentavious right? I'm Oliver, nice to meet you. Okay, nice to meet you. So you settling into the new year? Sure, I'm having a great semester. Yeah, I hate college too. But you know what, I think that just means people like us, we know bigger things lie ahead. What are you talking about? What's your major? Musical theory. No, what do you really want to do? I'm a singer, so I guess I could make my own music. I was hoping you'd say that. Why is that? I'm a mild Atterberg fan. So I bought a ticket to the Ein Deutsches Requiem to hear the baritone solo. But when I got to the symphony hall I ran into Munkacs who told me. Atterberg's plane was grounded in Toronto and his understudy had food poisoning. So he had to drive to your dorm, pick up and take you downtown. That was really good singing Kentavious. If I didn't know better I'd say that part was written for you. I can't believe you actually know all that. I mean thank you. Is that the kinda singing you wanna do, the opera stuff? No. I would actually like to create my own genre, but honestly who wouldn't? Tell me more about it. I don't know. Something that would last under repeated examination. One that will cook and brew and result in a product that has value and which will be recognize as beautiful. Even if no one knows who wrote it. New, avant-garde but just right. Music that makes an impact. Exactly. Well what about your acapella group Tonal Recall, you able to work on it with them at all? Yeah. They don't really have the same dedication that I have. Well I'll tell you what, I got this music idea that I've been working on. I'd love to run it by you. How about we go grab a drink and talk about it? You mean like right now? No way bruh I got class. It's college, you're supposed to miss class. Come on, you're not gonna regret it. Where's all this coming from? From that article Rolling Stone did on your band five years ago. It talked about your strategy, your ideals, all of that. And based on what I've heard tonight it's not too hard to extrapolate the rest. Good right on time. Kentavious I'd like for you to meet Soo and Maxime. Hi, nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Maxime. Welcome, take a seat. Thank you. You didn't miss anything. So nice to see you guys outside of class, where are you from? New York by way of Paris for me, and Seoul for Soo. That's awesome how do you like living in New York? Funny, no one from the city has ever asked me that. Constantly I tell them that for me. My childhood wasn't so different. I walked with the nanny to and from school, did my homework, ate dinner, then bed. Growing up is what cities like New York or Paris offer. It instills a sensibility that is more important than learning. Making school so pointless and interminable. Ah yes, on the impracticality of college for people like us with the skills to survive in the real world four years is a long stretch of youth wasted on slideshow presentations and half assed essays. Ironically I chose you all because you're over qualified for school. Bold but bored and idealistic, in a real rush to get to the real world, to make a real impact. However I wanna remind you college still provides a very important, very unique opportunity. What is that? Well college helps you make a real impact by bringing the impressionable masses right to your doorstep. He had you all entranced like a cult leader or an evangelical might, and he continues and he goes you know how to instill change? You win the hearts and souls of your constituents. We use pop to become popular. We still the bait and switch model from the Betos and just like them we don't stop at the music but we create our own way of life. Now the band, that's the easy part, see Kentavious here is a terrific singer. Whoa. And if Munkacs is to be believed he's an even better songwriter. Soo, Maxime. I play violin. And I used to DJ in a club back home. Really? Yeah, I'm really good at scratching. Now becoming a successful band is no longer a mystery it's a pretty simple formula, and look at you, my beautiful group of eclectics. You guys are at 75% of the work right there. And the last 25%, that's where I come in, do some of my magic. What magic exactly? Legend has it that Kitt Lampert, one of the producers of The Who took Pete Townsend to the Royal Ballet where his father was once a composer and his godmother was the prima ballerina. Kitt and Pete's takeaway was that opera was a silly, archaic bit of nonsense that needed to be reinvented. The result, the 1969 release of Tommy, a rock opera. A culturally transformative work. We build our audience now. We use all the free time and free rehearsal space and performance opportunity, Battle of the Band, talent show garbage things we can get our hands on. We build up our voice and we determine our own direction. I don't just mean creatively, but I'm talking culturally, even politically, so what do you say, got a couple of pop songs in you? And don't worry you're gonna be sneaking your John Lennon solo songs onto our platinum albums in no time. Well, it does beat joining the Young Republicans. Sounds great, I'm in. Oh come on Stan you know exactly who I'm talking about. The black girl in the white dress. Look who it is. Hey. Hey, God you've been gone for so long. But I made you coffee. Yeah? Yeah. Thanks. So, where you been, I've been texting you? I know I'm sorry, guess I've been busy with my music, been putting a lot of time into that band idea, you know the one I mentioned to you? Oh yeah. I met this kid named Oliver and wow, he's something else. He has some real ambition in his ideas, he feels if we're able to catch the following from millennials and get 'em hooked on our music. Sounds riveting. It is, I mean we've recorded like three songs already. All written by me, yours truly. And then Oliver's on the road, and he's doing his thing, he's booking us gigs. It's gonna be great. Has Oliver explained how to make this following actionable? What do you mean? Like what's the point of it all? The point? Oliver is handling everything okay? He said he just wants me to focus on writing good music, and that's what I've been doing. But you're still going to Salzburg with Professor M? Yeah, no we talked yeah, everything's still good with Professor. Oh good. It's gonna be dope. I hope so. Despite that Rolling Stone only wrote about the Nighthawks because of Oliver's initial pitch daylight Kentavious failed to notice that Oliver just casually mentioned they're greater goals only if their first few concerts were to begin to attract attention. This is the scene of their eighth concert in just a short while, and afterward no one heard from Oliver about his aspirations again. I don't believe Oliver was malicious but instead riddled by the same disease that plagues most millennials, a lack of concentration, unable to see things through, preferring to not face adversity, that is why the Nighthawks would continue to go from venture to venture without a serious plan for each, they never held themselves accountable. Stan! In those early days when Kentavious asked Oliver about his goals that Alison so cared about, Oliver repeated that this goal would not prove fruitful overnight. It required patience. So what happens next, since you know every damn thing? Here. What's this? Open it. Okay. How? The band is doing great so, happy Tuesday. Thank you brother, happy Tuesday, so everything's going well? Everything's going better than well. You know we're really starting to make a lot of money now. But what about the other stuff? What other stuff? Come on, you know that takes time. But it's been awhile right? Are you serious? I just gave you a real nice gift and you're sitting up here grilling me about it now? No, no I'm not. I'm not I'm just saying. Think about it, you think Bono would be Bono if he started doing all his philanthropy work in the first six months in the beginning of U2? No. Right, exactly. Writing these songs, having people listen to my music and go crazy over it, that's my dream, and that's what it's all about. And pretty soon they'll be able to realize what real music is. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Hey man that is really good. Yeah? Yeah. You know what? You should play that at our show this weekend. No way, it's not nowhere near ready I can't. Why not try it out, the audience will tell you if it's ready or not. Nah. Yeah Kent please, can't you see we're all sick of crowd pleasing, playing the same mainstream music over and over again? This is what we were talking about at the beginning, the Beetles, Bob Dylan, even Lady Gaga does it, you hook the audience, and then you slowly shape their tastes with the more challenging stuff. And before you know it the crowd is going wild for the weird, artsy stuff that they woulda hated at first. Trust me. You really think so? I know so. ♪ Welcome to my fair ♪ ♪ It makes you feel so fair ♪ ♪ The crowd is dancing there ♪ ♪ Rocking everywhere ♪ ♪ That is long ♪ ♪ Rocking record square ♪ ♪ I will not care ♪ Goodnight New York!

Oliver tell them, we have 100k in gigs lined up. Who wants to experience that again? You really think that change happens? No, I am not doing that again, I'm not! Okay fine, I guess we're stuck. Are you guys serious? Look at how far we've come, no, no. No I'm telling you, so what? We always knew the band was just gonna be step one in our plan, that it was gonna be the stepping stone to something better. So they didn't like our new music, big deal, we always knew that the next step was gonna require more patience. I think we're in the perfect position to be influential. Influential, are you still pushing influence? I mean when we first started you threw out some big ideas but now we're raking in the money it's almost like you forgot why I chose to join this in the first place Oliver. What are you talking about, because I pushed you to perform a song that you actually believe in? No man, no matter what happened tonight our stock is as high as it's ever been. Which is why I think it's time to move on to phase two. What's phase two? You ever heard of the Phantasm? No. What the hell is that? It's a secret society in Oxford that poses as a prestigious nightclub. When the club owners find an individual that's particularly interesting they put them through a series of unorthodox interviews, to find to everything they can about the subject and find out what they're really made of. So what are you saying, that we're gonna open a club like that? What about school, you think I'm going to drop out this semester? You know I'm supposed to go to Salzburg and I'm not missing that for anybody, that could be huge for me. Maybe, but what would really be huge is for us to run a club where the most elite people come. I'm talking about being at the center of culture. Making connections with people that really matter. I mean that's what we always talked about. Look, we're big enough that people are gonna come to this club. Now it's just on us to make sure that they stick around. So, what I propose is that this week we announce the band is breaking up. That way anticipation is gonna be through the roof when we open the club, and I guarantee you Kentavious we have some fan that's gonna come and bring his muckity muckity muck dad. Think about it Kent, it could be a good move for us, for you, for your career. I felt they abandoned the band too soon, and did so not because it was the right moment, but because a hurdle was thrown at them that a strong commitment could've overcome. But they chose not to face it, instead they convinced themselves that the next venture radically different would be more satisfying and productive than the one they chose not to work through 'til its conclusion. Quite the negative attitude Stan. Just because one DA came to your establishment didn't mean you created the next Porcellian Club. But look I'll give it to you, your club really is something. It must've been back then. That is the District Attorney. Really? Well Kentavious, how about we introduce ourselves? Let's. Hello Mr. Blackwood, my name is Oliver, this is my friend Kentavious, we are two of the proprietors of this establishment. We just wanted to come over here, tell you how honored we are to have you join us on opening night. Well I'm glad to be here, and thank you for your hospitality. My son and his friends are huge fans of yours. They were at the concert in New Haven that you had. Now they're over there hanging out. Really? Look, they told me all about your goals, it's great to see millennials not just talking the talk but walking the walk. Wow, that really means the world. Why don't you have them come over, we would love to share drinks with them as well? Oh of course, Rachel. You give me a call if you ever need anything. I'll be more than happy to help. Thank you, I mean thanks a lot. As the years passed, 303 rooftop brunches later, the NightHawks refined their club, created an extensive background check process for potential interviewees and solidified the club as the New York home for the few, the proud, and the hip. But other than hefty quarterly distributions they had nothing substantive to show for these years. Allowing the money to take precedent over their goals that had inspired them just a few years before. Good evening, and good morning to all you degenerates of the dark! An eternal state of oblivious dissatisfaction. Stop it! You are the delitant. Trying to dabble in finance, writing, the arts, all of this just because you'd rather go with the flow than take some initiative. Anyway, terms like narcissistic are used too freely these days. And I suspect an objective observer would describe Maxime, Soo, and Oliver in the same way. That their respective upbringings rendered each of them incapable of becoming involved unselfishly, and unsparingly in the life of another person. Yet they found each other, liked each other. Sort of Seinfeld but without the laughs. It seemed to make no difference among the three of them they didn't even notice, but Kentavious, fundamentally vulnerable became a victim. What the hell are you doing here? What a characteristically loving thing to say after all this time. I tried calling you and you haven't answered. And well, my well meaning shrink thinks that I should speak to you. Well, if I didn't answer than that obviously means I was busy, right? Doing what, choosing seating arrangements for the Euro trash that heard that this was a hip place in New York? Yeah, sure. I was raped. What do you mean? By who? It didn't just happen, it happened six months ago, and the entire investigation was botched of course, otherwise I would spare you the news. I didn't want to tell you but I've run out of options, all but one. And what option is that? My shrink says that I need closure. For me that's identifying what the campus cops called the perpetrator, for me that's control, and I need it. I've come to terms with this pretty much, but I need to know who did it. And it seems that your enhanced interview technique is the only way to get the potential culprit and interrogate him. For him, it will be a party, but for us it will be finding the truth. We'll record it and we'll forget about the campus cops. We'll hand it over to the real police. Okay. Okay. Listen I need every name, every number, every address, every detail, all infor. This is all the information. Everything I remember. Caroline, is this her address? Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Who is Alison Kane? She's your sister isn't she? And you let her down. How do you know that? You just told me that. Clearly you've been tormented by something. What do you mean? You're angry that you pushed her away the last three years, because all that time you knew she was the only one that could tell you that you've in fact accomplished nothing. And that you've allowed Oliver to run how you live, and how you work, and who you are Kentavious. You've been so caught up pretending to be someone that you're not you've forgotten about the original goal to become someone. Take it from me, you still wonder whether if you had listened to Oliver's goals all those years ago if you'd even be here now. Maybe if you'd stayed true to your best intentions, who I believe you are, you would've had the presence of mind to be there for her, protected her, looked after her. Been the first person she came to with this burden but instead, she's coming to you as a last resort isn't she? When you're from what you're from you don't have to be omniscient to know that family is the only thing in life that isn't just noise. So this is what you needed to do for your sister, the meaning of which, the importance of which you found and you studied. You disappeared for three months and then. Kentavious, welcome. How have you been, what happened? Maxine: How have you been? Welcome. Welcome back. So how do you like the bar? You better like it because you're a partner. It's nice, everything you said it would be. Yeah a lot of pink, your favorite color. Nice. What is that real? Let me see? You ever thought about actually taking somebody's life? What are you talking about, taking somebody's life? I mean think about it, what if a guy escaped from the police and you caught him and you killed him, should you feel guilty or should you actually feel like a hero? I'm sorry am I missing something, we're talking about killing somebody? I'm talking about protecting the people that we love. What happened? Oh finally, a question that our all mighty prophet doesn't know the answer to. Well we've been trying to locate you everywhere. We called Alison, she didn't even know where you were. You called Alison? Alison was raped. What? Brother I am so sorry. Now you're sorry. Are you sorry that your influence that you promised us doesn't mean shit? Do you know I called the DA to try to get help for Alison and he didn't even know who I was? What's the point of doing all of this Oliver if it doesn't mean anything? Where have you been man? Why didn't you tell us any of this? For the past three months I've been trying to help my sister man. The cops aren't doing shit, nobody's doing anything! I've been out searching for leads! What did you find? I found someone, his name is Chad Parrish. You remember Trey, our patron from the club? Chad was tagged in all the pictures that Trey was in from the same frat party that Alison was raped at, he's the guy. So what now? I feel like we bring him in for a good old Nighthawks interview. At least that way we'll be able to get the truth out of him. Okay so we bring this Chad guy in, we have Marguerite work her magic, we figure out what really happened, then we go to the police. She asked me if I wanted a hand job, I said no, I've got two hands for myself. Hey. Hello, oh that's good, that's good. Good, yeah. You find Maxime beautiful? If she made advances on you, you would accept them? Yeah, sure, why not? You work in a bank. I'm in private equity. How private, how equitable, don't you wanna do something that really excites you? My considerable income excites me plenty. Yeah good one, go on to the next. You've never been in love. Only with the man I see in the mirror. Why not someone beautiful and sophisticated, hmm, say Maxime? I don't know. I just met her 10 minutes ago. What if I told you that she was telling me before she sat down next to you how cute she thought you were? Cute? So Marguerite I heard these interviews can get pretty crazy. Crazy, crazy how? You know. Hmm? Are we done? No we are not done and if you won't take Maxime right now like a red blooded American boy then we're gonna have to arrange something a lot less pleasant for you. Take her, hmm? Who the fuck do you think I am? What do you think you are? Well it wouldn't be the first time your kind took advantage of a sleeping girl. One of my kind? What the fuck are you talking about? Oh, I apologize that I know your fraternities ionic bond formed over the extensive knowledge of the chemical makeup of Rohypnol, ketamine, and GHB. Well fuck you very much, I'd like to go now. Where's the door, I'd like to fucking leave, this isn't what I signed up. Oh, so soon? Chad. Kentavious this isn't right, okay let's wrap it up. Anything? I don't recognize him. Well I didn't want to upset you but people are telling me that you had sex with a girl who was passed out at a frat party and we think that was bad form so. Do I look like the kind of guy who needs to fuck a girl while she sleeps? Alright, forget about her, what about me? Could you do it with a woman awake looking you in the face. Yeah he's lying, stay here. Hey, hey, Kentavious where you going? You did it, I know you did it, don't you lie to me, you raped her! Jesus Christ. Everybody already said you did it! Did what? You fucking raped her. I didn't rape anybody, who the fuck are you man? Don't you worry about who I am. What about the name Alison Kane, ring a bell? And you're Chad Parrish. You're Alison's brother. Shit. Listen man I'm really sorry about what happened to your sister but it wasn't me. You're lying, don't you lie to me man. No, no, I, but I know who did, I have a picture of him with your sister that night and he was walking her upstairs. You're fucking lying. I'm not lying, let me show you. Kentavious put the gun down, we don't know who did what. You better not be lying to me. Yeah. That's your guy, that's Stanley. This is a lead alright, we got to take this to the police and then let them handle it. No, no, no, no more fucking police! Please, if you give me two days I will bring this guy to you, I will bring him to you. No, no we're gonna do this my way. You're gonna gather all of the information on this Stan the same way we did for you, and you're gonna come here tomorrow or else I'm gonna be at your house Chad. And I promise I'm not gonna be so kind. Trust me, you're not off the hook yet buddy. Whoa, hey, hey, it was Chad, it was Chad. No, no, no, it was you, you lied to me man. I did not lie to you, I didn't do it. Kentavious this isn't right. No, we supposed to be doing this my way. It's supposed to be my way, and this is supposed to be the guy, he's our guy. Kent get a grip please. I know how bad you want this guy to be the guy, but think, you heard him explain what happened, you heard him recite his poem. You have seen him not going for the bait with either Marguerite or me when he was far too wasted to hide anything. He is just as capable of doing what are you accusing him of as you are. This isn't what I asked of you. Kent, it's alright. It was you. You looked wonderful that night. Look Chad had just invited me to come live with him in his apartment, and he thought I should loosen up, so he asked me to go to some alumni weekend with him where I didn't know anybody there. You look really pretty tonight, I like how you did your hair. Thank you. Did we do the spin? No, God no. Did he actually do it? Well babe, remember my first drink. Let me put this down. I was standing in a corner awkwardly when a girl who was inebriated needed my help. Hey, are you okay? I mean I'd be stumbling too if I had to wear those heels. Whoa, whoa, hey. Why don't we just find somewhere for you to lie down, how about that? So I escorted her up the stairs and I left her up there. It's my fault for not thinking what could happen. Those guys vanished on me after an hour and I thought they ran off with their girls, but I had no idea it was the same girl, Kentavious look at me! It wasn't me, okay? It wasn't me! Come on! But I think you know who it was, don't you? It was Chad, but I should've known, Caroline should've known, that night we were all complicit. Stan, you need to leave now. Despite everything that happened Alison did find her truth. She got her closure. And to a degree so did I. ♪ I just need to ♪ ♪ Be ♪ ♪ I just need to ♪ ♪ Be ♪ ♪ I just need to ♪ ♪ Be ♪ ♪ I just need to ♪ ♪ Be ♪ ♪ I just need to ♪ ♪ Be ♪
