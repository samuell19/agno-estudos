[MUSIC] [SINGING] NARRATOR: For centuries, the South Seas have been remote-- rich in romance and mystery. It has always been a magnet to lure the scholar, the sportsman and the adventurer. [GUNSHOTS] -Come on, Rooney. [BARKS] -Hey. Hey. Four. Three. Two. [BARKS] -You're offside. Wait a minute, now, you're offside. Come on, come up [BARKS] -Eight. Four. Two. Hike. Attaboy! (LAUGHING) [BARKS] -There are scores of islands such as these. Possibly uninhabited since the beginning of time. -Do you mean to say nobody lives on a beautiful island like that? -Not at all. -Pull. [GUNSHOTS] -You know this may sound crazy, but I've got a notion-- -Ha! If you've got a notion, ten to one it's crazy, all right. -You know, I'd like to get off at an island like that, with nothing but a toothbrush. -For the love of Pete. We're on our way to shoot tigers in Sumatra. Now what's the big idea? -I don't have to kill to get a thrill. I'd like to get off at an island like this and fight the battle of nature against man with my bare hands. Rah. -(LAUGHING) Well, it was on an island just like this that Robinson Crusoe lived. -That's exactly what I mean. -Ah, Robinson Crusoe was a myth. -Well let's make him a reality. -You? Why you've been living behind that board chair so many years, you'd be crying mama the first day. -Don't you believe it. -You're not in your right mind, old boy. -Nope. If I were, I wouldn't be thinking of a thing like this. I tell you what you fellows do, go on to Sumatra, get your tiger. When you get back, you'll find me living in a penthouse with hot and cold running water and groceries delivered twice a day. -Not a chance. There are cannibals on these islands. When we got back, we'd find you tied to a stake and be the remnants of a short dinner. -Bet you wouldn't. -Bet you would. -Bet you wouldn't! -Bet you would. -I'll bet you a million dollars. -Make it a thousand in real money, and I'll bet you. -You're on. -Roget, uh, pack his toothbrush, he's leaving. -Now wait a minute now, this is the bet. I'll bet you when you get back, I'll be living the life of Riley, and you bet that I'll be tied to a stake. That right? -That's right. -Good. Haha! Watches for flattery and ties for fools. I'm off! [SPLASH] [BARKS] -Where shall we send your mail? -Park Avenue and 52nd street. (LAUGHING) [BARK] [SPLASH] -Hey! How about that dog? -Well, Robinson Crusoe had a dog. Here, you can have the toothbrush. I'll roll my own. Come on, Rooney! -He'll win that bet, or die in the attempt. -Do you think so? -I've got something up my sleeve. -Rooney, now you be a good sport and go through with this thing, I'll take you to a cat farm next summer. Attaboy! He's [INAUDIBLE] all right. (LAUGHING) Well, Rooney, we're certainly in for it now. Cut off from the world for many, many months. I suppose the first thing to do is look for water. No, (LAUGHING) no, drinking water. Aqua Pura. Come on, let's go. Ah. Rain water. That's not bad. Try it. Here, taste it. It's a little brackish, but not bad at all. Go on, try it. Now, wait a minute, I'll give you one more chance. Coconuts. Fresh water from coconuts. [THUMPING] -You must have an ancestor, that's not very far removed, that could pull his teeth in a situation like this and swallow with one gulp. [TAPPING] -Aah. Try this. Just live on a high hat, you and I are going to get into difficulty. You know, I'm a darn sight more adaptable than you are. Ha! Pretty smart, Rooney. Now you're taking after your great-grandfather. Well, Rooney? Rooney, here's looking at you. Aah. Now how about something to eat? Ho, ho. (LAUGHING) I may finish by eating grass, but I'm certainly not going to start that way. Ha. Ha, vanCamp's back yard. Coconuts-- Bananas-- Breadfruit-- Pineapples! I'm all set, now what about you? I'm afraid you've got to go on a diet. Now, for a place to live. [SCREECHING] -Eh, ha ha ha. -Ha ha. -Marvelous! Here's-- here's Park Avenue, and here's 52nd Street. There it is, all in a nutshell. Water, food, shelter. That, my boy, is called a survey. The next thing is an engineering job. Now I'm going to show you a little trick. This happened 10, 15, or 200,000 years ago. The first thing that man did when he stood on his hind legs was to throw his brain into a new position. His nails got short, and his teeth got dull, and he made himself his first implement. This is burl bark, Rooney. Natives of these islands make rope out of this and various other things. Rooney, I suppose you're wondering where I got all this information. Well, I've been a Boy Scout, and I've read Dan Beard's Handy Book. This is the first labor-saving device known to man. Man found it useful in a hundred ways. A hundred ways to use it. No nails, no screws, no spikes. Nothing to deceive you. Simple twist to the wrist, and presto chango, you have it. Eureka! [THUMPING] [BARKING] (LAUGHING) This is going to be a cinch. Isn't nature wonderful? Isn't nature kind! [WHIMPERS] -Oh, ho ho, ha ha ha. [CHITTERING] -I beg your pardon, I'm wrong again. Come on Rooney, we'll build a house in spite of our unfriendly neighbors. -Now here's an island that is totally different, both uh, geographically and in vegetation, from our Robinson Crusoe island. -Uh, oh, look who's here. Ooh, a little drama going on, on this island. Little girl evidently does not want to take a bath. Mama spank. By jove, she's a cute little princess. -Wait a minute, do you know what this is? It's betrothal ceremony. -Betrothal? -Yes. The girl presents her comb to the man she is supposed to marry. He accepts it as a token of the engagement. -Look at the face of the guy she's going to marry. Hmm. I wonder who the grouchy old dame is? -Probably the girl's mother. -(LAUGHING) Well, she's a good match for the son-in-law, all right, all right, all right. There. What happens after the betrothal? -Well, after several months, or as the natives say, after the fourth moon, they have the wedding. And the girl is bathed by her bridesmaids, dressed, garlanded, and taken before the groom-to-be. Whereupon, to complete the ceremony, the husband knocks out her front teeth. -(LAUGHING) No kidding? -Actual fact. -Oh, well, we do the same thing. Only we usually wait until after the ceremony. -(LAUGHING) Yes. Ha. OK. -(PARROTING) OK. [LAUGHTER] [BARK] -Gandhi! Never pick on a man when he's down. [WHISTLES] Never. Come here. [WHISTLES] Come here. Come on, come on. (LAUGHING) Nice playing sportsmanship. [CHITTERING] [ROAR] [ROAR] [ROARS] [SHOTS] -Boy, that's what I call a tale! Think of Crusoe, missing all this, stopping off at an island to play house where nothing ever happens. -Hah! There, boy, that gives us two fine traps. Now if there are any of these mysterious animals that seem to be wandering around here and want to contribute to this little Robinson Crusoe drama, we're ready for them. [RATTLING] -Ah, that ought to work without a hitch. [CHITTERING] -Come on boy, time for dinner. It won't be long, now. We'll soon be moving into our penthouse. [CHITTERING] -OK. [SQUAWKING] -Ah, where are your manners, Gandhi? Pass something to Sookie. [SQUAWKING] -Aw, nuts! -Where's Rooney? [CHITTER] -Drunk? [CHITTERING] -Oh, oh. Fishing. [CHITTERING] -Ah, Rooney. Only one fish? [BARKS] -Hey, you got to do better than that. [WHINE] [BARK] [WHINE] -Low tide, nothing. Now you told me that yesterday. Ha ha. This looks more like the Swiss Family Robinson. (LAUGHING) Hey, what's the idea? [ROAR] [RATTLE] -Trap number two. Our first catch! Ha. Ah, welcome to our city. I was wondering where we were going to get our butter. [NATIVE SINGING] [DRUMS] -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [NATIVE SINGING] [MUSIC] [CRASH] [SQUEAKS] [WATER RUNNING] [DRIPPING] [DING] [BAA] [DING] [BARKS] [SQUIRTS] [PATHETIC CHITTERING] [HORN BLOWING] [CREAK] [SQUEAK] -Hey! Hey! Aha! You wanna play, eh? [RUSTLING] [BONK] -You don't seem to understand, but you're going to be my man Friday. Ha! Science against brute strength. You know this is Stecher's famous scissor hold. Now do you give up? Whew. I thought you would be a Good Friday. This is Gotch's famous toe hold, and my own hammer lock. How do you like that? There, now you be a good boy. Hey! I'm not going to stand for this. Hope this hurts me worse that it does you. Oh, you feel that way about it? Now if this water cure doesn't work, I'm going to try castor oil. Now, behave yourself. Oh, a headhunter. You must be Friday the 13th. Aha. You killed a radio operator, you should have killed a radio announcer. Hmm. I've got a notion, it might be crazy. [SCREECH] -Zinc. Radio tubes, zinc, copper, loudspeaker, a radio. Friday, you're going to make the first real contribution to our venture. We'll call the station F-R-D-Y. [RADIO MUSIC] -When you're housebroken, Friday, I'm going to untie you. [RADIO SQUEALING] -(RADIO VOICE) and the seamstress... -Hey! Come back here! [RATTLING] -Now I don't think Robinson Crusoe had anything like this. I've got to read that book again. Friday's gone. You must be Saturday. [SQUAWK] [BARK] [CHITTERING] -Ah. You're better, huh? Tell me, where did you come from? [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING GERMAN] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING PIG LATIN] -Did you swim? Did you paddle a canoe? Oh. Paddle. From that island, over there? Oh, I see, that island over there. Look around, we're not quite fixed up. We-- we weren't expecting anyone yet. Heh. Yeah, that's early Grand Rapids. I may exchange that piece. Ha ha. Sears, Roebuck. That bed is only here on approval. Ah, you want to see this, this is a cute one. Watch this. All right. How do you like that? [BARKS] -Well, I must say. -OK. -Is that so. Ha, ha, ha. -(RADIO SINGING) jewelry. Look at me, I'm king of all I survey! Come on and give me the stars, God's heaven above me, where is that power, the one who will love me, and I'll travel along, singing a vagabond song. -Tired? -(RADIO ANNOUNCER) This is station KTR, San Flashing the news of the day.
