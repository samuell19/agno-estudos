Yeah, well, I don't see my kids that much. Besides, it's depressing. What? Getting up close to animals? I mean, where the hell else you going to get that close to a cheetah? Yeah, that cheetah can run like a motherfucker, but in a zoo? They ain't got enough room to hit second gear. I mean it ain't like they're in their natural habitat. Yeah, no shit, man.
