- Ta-ra, Sid. - Cheerio, Fred. Good night. See you in the morning, Fred. - Good night. - Cheerio. - Good night. - Good night. - All correct. - Mm-hm. All correct, sir. - Good night, Charlie. - Good night. Sloane? No problems. Come on over as soon as you can. I'm hungry. Harriet P. Jefferson. What did the P. stand for? Pargiter. Harriet Pargiter Jefferson. I telephoned the reservations this morning. Your booking's been canceled, Mrs. Jefferson. Oh, er, well, that's ridiculous. I telephoned this morning and left my full name. Harriet Pargiter Jefferson. Are you quite sure? A gentleman rang this afternoon and canceled the booking. Canceled it? Well, this is plain stupid. - There's been some terrible mistake. - I'm very sorry, madam. Oh, very well. What other seats have you? I'm afraid there's only standing room left. Oh, but this is terrible. Do you realize how far I've come for this game? I've been watching ice hockey for years and years. Long before you were ever... If you'd just wait a moment, madam, I'll see to this gentleman first. Wait? I never heard of anything so… so... Excuse me, er. Maybe I can help you out. I was just going to return a ticket. - Oh, you were? - Yes. Well, that's very kind of you. You see, I have two, and my friend won't be able to make it. Perhaps you'd like to fill in for him. - What kind of seat is it? - Well, it's third-row center. - Would you mind, madam, please? - Yes, I most certainly… - Er, it was exactly 15 shillings. - Oh, this is very kind of you. I can't think who canceled my booking! I know I didn't. Yeah! Yeah! Not a bad game. Of course, our boys had it all their own way. Half of them are Polish, you know. The only real Canadians here are on the home team. You're from Toronto, aren't you, Mrs. Jefferson? - Well, how did you guess? - Your accent. I was born there myself. Well, if that isn't a coincidence! How long have you been in England, Mister, er, Gregory? Ever since the war. How about you? Oh, I just got in last night. Can you beat it? I made the papers. Well, now. You're a real celebrity, aren't you? Oh no. That was my debut in print. Well, I'm certainly glad to have met you, Mr. Gregory. - It's an ill wind. - It is indeed. And you're sure I can't drop you anywhere? Quite sure. Well, thanks again. Don't forget our date. I'll be there. Oh, by the way, I almost forgot. What do you do, Mr. Gregory? I try to write plays. Oh no. How exciting! You must tell me all about it tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. Bye-bye! And I don't mind admitting to you, Mr. Gregory, that I can't tell the difference between a groat and a noble. Of course, Joe was crazy about them, but to me, they're just so much idle capital. And dealers are such cheats. Do you know that man at Dodds had the gall to offer me £55,000? Why, they're insured for 65! You'd better watch your language, Mrs. Jefferson. One of my best friends is a dealer. Um… - What do these coins look like? - I'll show them to you one day. Why, they're beautiful, Mrs. Jefferson. Oh, they're pretty enough, I guess. All the same, I'll be glad when they're sold. I want to get back home. And this place is costing the earth to rent. Now, you make yourself comfortable and I'll be right back. Would you like some more coffee, sir? No. No, thank you, Agnes. How's that second act coming, Paul? Terrible. I can't figure out what to do with the old lady. Kill her off. Honestly, Paul, is there any money in playwriting? Honestly, Mrs. Jefferson? No. Then I don't see how you can afford to take me out all the time. You really ought to be more careful. Oh, now, Harriet, don't bully me. It's your birthday. You're much too good to me. By the way, Paul, have you heard from your friend lately? Let me do that for you. What friend? The dealer you were telling me about. What's he like? Lee Henderson? Oh, he's honest, and what's more, he's rich. Twelve years ago, we both came out of the army together, flat broke. Now, he's got branches in Paris, Rome, and New York, and I'm still stuck in the second act. Thank you. Tell me the truth, Paul. What happens when your money runs out? No idea. Anything could happen. For instance, er… you might give me a job. What kind of job? Oh, selling the Jefferson collection. On commission. We'll have to think about that. Well, bye-bye, Paul. Thanks for the lunch. Any time. - See you Thursday, then. - Good. Lot 164. Chair from the suite in the anteroom. Four chairs and a settee. How much for it? Fifty guineas for it? - Lee? - Oh, hello, Greg. How are you? Fine, thank you. Harriet, I'd like you to meet Lee Henderson. Lee, this is Mrs. Jefferson. - How do you do, Mr. Henderson? - How do you do? Well, I gather Greg has told you I'm trying to sell my husband's collection? He did mention it, yes. We were hoping you might be able to help us find a buyer. What sort of offers have you had? Well, Dodds & Dodds have offered me £55,000. Well, from what I know of the collection, you'd be mad to take anything under 60. I mean those 4th-century tetradrachmas alone are worth 10,000. Well, that certainly sounds more like it. The trouble is, I'm going to be out of the country, so there's very little I can do to help. I'm willing to give Greg any addresses or contacts he needs. I take it he's acting for you? Well, er… there's nothing actually in writing. I see. Excuse us a minute, will you, Greg? Certainly. Now, listen, Mrs. Jefferson. Er… I like Greg. I've known him all my life, and it's very kind of you to help him like this. He certainly needs it, but… Well, let's face it. This is a completely new field for him. Now, give him a letter of authority by all means, he'll need that anyway, but be careful how you word it. Authorize him to sell the coins, and only the coins, at a figure, not less than, say… £55,000. Now, that way, you're fully protected. Oh, I see what you mean. Well, thanks for the advice, Mister, er, Henderson. Would you care to join us for a drink? No, thanks. I'm due at the airport. Well, goodbye, Mrs. Jefferson. - Goodbye, Mr. Henderson. - And good luck. - Thank you. - Greg? Call my secretary in the morning. - What did you think of him? - Oh, he's absolutely charming. The train now standing at platform 4 is the 10.28 for Aylesbury. Well, have a nice rest. Too bad you changed your mind about coming down. There's plenty of room at the cottage. No, I've got to finish the play first. I'm just on the last lap now. I'm going to miss you. I'll tell you what. I could come down on Monday. Why don't you make it a long weekend? - I think I'll do that. - Good. Let me know when you arrive Monday. - Right. I'll give you a ring. Bye-bye. - Bye-bye! I can't tell you how delighted we are that Mrs. Jefferson has decided to accept our offer. £55,000 is a pretty formidable sum. We'll see you on Monday, then. Oh, don't forget your letter of authority. Thanks. There is one other thing. Mrs. Jefferson would like to be paid in cash. That's by no means usual. Entirely contrary to the firm's policy. Mrs. Jefferson has a fixed mistrust of the commercial world, Mr. Dodds. Personally, I think she's crazy, but… well, that's the way she wants it. A banker's draft, possibly? I'm sorry, gentlemen. At what time may we expect you on Monday? Eleven o'clock. Good morning, gentlemen. Have a nice weekend. Hello, Agnes? This is Mr. Gregory. I'm speaking from Aylesbury. Look, Mrs. Jefferson's had a nasty attack of asthma and she'd like you to come down and help out for a few days. Oh, yes? She wants you to catch the 10:28 from Marylebone. Is that okay? The 10:28, yes. Good. Oh, and there's one other thing. I believe Mrs. Hammond is coming in this afternoon. Would you leave the key for her in the tub outside the front door? Which tub, Mr. Gregory? Well, I really don't know. Just one moment. Which tub, Harriet? Oh, yes, the one on the left as you go out. And don't worry, Agnes, I'll meet you at the station. Yes, Mr. Gregory. Goodbye. Good morning, Mr. Gregory. Do sit down. Let me give you some sherry. What made you do this, Mr. Gregory? Completely irresponsible, packing them like this. Don't you realize the slightest scratch can destroy the value of a coin? Oh, well. Let's check through the contents, Miss Rogers. Strange woman, Mrs. Jefferson. Have you been working for her long? No, not long. Just filling in. It's obvious, if you'll forgive my saying so, that you're a stranger to the world of numismatology. Yes. I'm afraid we may have given you a wrong impression on Friday. As a matter of fact, cash transactions aren't all that rare. - Have you ever been to the Yemen? - No. There's only one kind of currency there. Solid silver coins called riyals. I have a friend out there who's paid by the month. He has to collect his wages in a shooting brake. Though I dare say you'd call it a station wagon, wouldn't you? Eh, Mr. Gregory? - What? - A shooting brake? All present and correct, Mr. Gregory. Now, shall we just check through these? Thank you, Miss Rogers. I take it they've just come from the bank? Oh, of course. We'll, er, consider them counted, then. Good morning, Sergeant. I want to deposit this, please. Right, sir. Mr. Hopkins, please. Ah, yes. Mr. Savage, isn't it? Password? Mountain. - No trouble? - No trouble. That was a great performance you gave. Where did you dig up that stuff about the tetradrachmas? Out of a book. Memoirs of an Honest Coiner, by the elder Dodds. - You got any sticking plaster? - Yes, in the bathroom. Ah. Here's your 3,000. The bank will have the numbers, so you're on your own with it now. Well, it's all fixed in Paris. Sorel's going to pay 3,500 francs for five pounds. Now, what about your end of the money? Now, he'd take the lot for the same price. Don't worry about my end of it. I'll take care of that when the time comes. I want 100 cents on the dollar. Well, they'll be probably picking me up before I get home. Better have a lawyer at Savile Row. Er, Bryant, if you can get him. You really are going to let them take you? Well, of course. There's no other way. There never was. Well, figure it out for yourself, Vic. I could have dressed up as a burglar and taken the coins and melted them down. You know how much they would have been worth? Maybe a fast 100 pounds. You're going to be away a long time, Greg. Not too long. I'm a first offender over here. Well, say they give me… five. Five years for £50,000. Or three years eight months, with time off for good behavior. Well, that works out at just under £14,000 a year. Er, tax-free. One of these days, Greg, your icy mask will drop. Yes, and I'll become a livid gibbering thing. I know. Savile Row, and, er… see that the lawyer's there. Don't worry, he'll be there. And Greg! - Huh? - Be lucky. - Paul Gregory? - Yes. You know what this is about. Yes, my, er, license has expired. Prisoner at the bar, Paul Gregory, you have been convicted by the jury of the charges contained in this indictment. You became possessed of no less than £55,000, not a single penny of which has been recovered. Furthermore, you have resolutely refused to render any assistance to the police, and, therefore, I feel it my duty to impose a severe sentence upon you. The sentence of the court is that you be imprisoned for ten years. Ten years. Ten years. With ten days to go until Christmas, reports from Smithfield Market show that although the demand for turkey is still increasing, prices have dropped considerably… - Everything all right? - Fine. - Oh! You look beautiful. - Oh, thanks a lot. - Who owns this place anyway? - A chap called Michael Bishop. He's gone to Tangier for a while. He's had what's known as a little trouble. I can imagine. Paul Gregory, the 35-year-old Canadian who was sentenced to ten years imprisonment at the Old Bailey for the theft of the Jefferson collection of rare coins, escaped from Wentworth Prison this evening and is still at large. Police in the Metropolitan area are... That's the shortest ten years you've ever lived through. - Did you have any trouble? - Only with the rope-climbing bit. Nobody ever taught me those commando routines. At least you were on your way out. I felt like a raving lunatic climbing in. What's in the case? What you asked for. Scotch, liver sausage, bread, spaghetti, milk, butter. And one surgical boot. - How's the passport situation? - I don't know yet. Should be all right. I've got a man coming down from Manchester tomorrow. He's got a contact with the passport office. But it's going to be a bit dodgy. He wants 200. Well, give it to him. I'm not going to argue about 200. No, it's not that. He wants a picture of you. You've got a camera. You can take a picture and develop it yourself. I know, Greg, but tomorrow, you're going to be all over the papers. And he'll know who I am. So what? Isn't he safe? Well, yeah, of course he is. It's just going to cost a bit more, that's all. Look, don't worry about the money. I'm not worried, Greg. What about the boat from Tilbury? Is that on or off? I've found something better, leaving Bristol Thursday night. A banana boat. It's anchored in the channel. No cops, no customs. You'll see nobody. - Except a couple of tarantulas. - Couple of what? Tarantulas. They live in banana boats. Oh, have a drink. It… it sounds great. Better get rid of this junk. I'll see to it. Leave it in the bag. I'll need the bag. I'll need it tomorrow. You want me to drive you in the morning? Drive me? Where would you be driving me? Oh, I don't know. Back to England. Or wherever you put it. Look, Vic, I haven't seen that money for a long time. We'll want to be left alone together. You know how it is. I know how it is, Greg. You'll get your other 2,000. Come round after lunch with your camera. Right. - Greg? - Hm? What's the boot for? No one ever looks a cripple in the eye. You know, you're a real weirdie. Michael? Mike, are you in the bath or something? - You looking for somebody? - Yes. Michael. - Michael? - Michael Bishop. He lives here. - I'm afraid he's out of the country. - That's fantastic. I've just come back from Paris. Came back especially to meet him. We're meant to be having supper. In that case, maybe you'd better come in for a minute. All I know about Mr. Bishop is that he left for Tangier a couple of days ago. I'm just a guest here. A friend of mine has taken the place furnished. I don't want to appear rude, but is there any reason why I should believe that? No, except it happens to be true. - Did he leave any message? - No, I'm afraid not. - Any forwarding address? - Afraid not. Rather curious behavior, don't you think? By some standards. It depends on how well you know him. By fiance standards. Or didn't you know we were engaged? Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps you didn't know him quite well enough. You aren't by any chance a loyal chum covering up for Michael, are you? Look, I've never even met him. You don't look like one of his friends. American or Canadian? American. I'm sorry. My name is Milligan, Philip Milligan. Mine's Bridget Howard. You live in England? I just got in from New York. - Business trip? - Well, sort of. I'm a writer. Er… look, can I get you a drink? - I'd love one. - Good. I'll just rinse these out. Who's your friend? - What friend? - The one who's living here. Oh, er… fellow named Henderson. Then who's Mr. Sloane? "Be lucky. Sloane." Well, that's his first name. I wonder what name the porter knows him by. Hello? Oh, is that the porter? Oh, I'm speaking from Mr. Michael Bishop's flat. Do you happen to know if it's been sub-let? Oh, I see. Do you know the new occupant's name? Oh, no. No. No, there isn't any reason why you should. But Mr. Bishop has definitely gone abroad? I see. Well, thank you. - Satisfied? - Yes. I'm sorry. I just couldn't believe it. It was silly of me. - Here's your drink. - Thank you. Well, you were right when you said I didn't know Michael. I should have known when you said Tangier. He sounds like a pretty offbeat kind of character. He used to call me a home for lost causes. Said I didn't understand anyone unless they were guaranteed failures. That's me. Lost causes and lame dogs. I'm sorry. Oh, forget it. Anyway, he had a problem and I've been trying to help him solve it. You see, we've both got an awful lot in common. Neither of us goes home much. I ran away from five schools, he ran away from four, and never anywhere, really, to run to. That's why I thought I could… He seems to have found another solution. I'd better go. I'll leave my new address for Michael. In case he calls. You ought to read this. It's one of our press clippings. Oh, what about your… Wine? Drink our health in it some time. Good night, Mister…? - Milligan. - Milligan. Thanks for being so patient. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Sergeant. Password "mountain". Well, just a moment, sir. I'll go and find Mr. Hopkins. You know, this one would steal anything. Last year, she even walked out of the store with a garden dwarf. Don't scare her off, George. I just want some information about the Sheffield job. Right. Mr. Savage? Will you step this way, Mr. Savage? Oh, I… I'm afraid I've troubled you for nothing. I… I left my key in my other suit. I'll have to come back later. As you please, sir. Why are you sitting in the dark? Because I like it. Is that wrong? No. - Just weird. - Yeah, all right. Where's the camera? Let's get it over with. There isn't going to be a picture, Greg. There isn't going to be a picture or a boat, nothing, till I take that money. - Money for what? The passport? - Shove the passport. I want the money you got from the vault this morning. I'm going to take it, Greg. It's too bad about you, Vic, it really is. - I'm going to take it. - I haven't got it. The money's exactly where it was. I changed my mind. Now, come off it, Greg. I followed you. You went in with the bag. You came back here with the bag. Five thousand out of 55? You must think I'm stupid. All right, you want the money, and I'm telling you it isn't here. I ought to break your back. What did you do with the money? I didn't get it. Right. Give me the key. Now, listen, Greg. You can't go anywhere without me. There's 100,000 of them out there all ready to blow the whistle on you. You remember that. I'll keep the key and we'll go along this afternoon. You're in no shape right now. I'll be back about 4:30. Sloane? Yeah? Be lucky. You know what's the matter with this fish of yours, don't you? He's dead. Why don't you get yourself something that'll last a little longer? Like a kangaroo or something. What can I do for you, sir? A three-pound bag of sand, please. A three-pound bag of sand. There we are. Nine pence, please. What's it for? Budgies or something? - A canary. - Canary. I see. OK, thank you, sir. Hel… ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun... ♪ Victor? Victor? Victor, honey, is that you? Victor? Listen, no one's going to hurt you. If you behave, you're going to be all right. If you don't, I'll kill you. I mean that. Greg? Greg? I'm sorry about this, Mary. But he's a very determined fellow, this Greg. Always works on his own. Doesn't need any help from anybody, except when he's conning old ladies or breaking out of prisons. Marvelous little planner, you see. Where are you gonna go that I can't find you? There used to be a bag of keys around here. Where are they? See what I mean? Always planning ahead. - I said, where are they? - I haven't the slightest idea. One of these days, you're going to need me, Greg. You're going to need me. Can I help you? Yes, I'd like to see copies of The Times for the last two weeks, please. Right, if you just go and sit down there, I'll bring them to you. Thank you. Operator, I wonder if you'd mind checking Kensington 7011 for me, please. I'm getting no reply. 7011. The, er, party's name is MacKinnon. Just a minute, sir. Do you live near here, sir? I do, yes. Queen's Gate, as it happens. I suppose you've come from somewhere near here? Yes, Exhibition Road. Is anything wrong? No, just doing my job, sir. I suppose you've got something on you to prove your identity. A letter or something, sir? Well, I don't know. I may have. Perhaps you'd better tell me what this is all about. Would you mind just opening that bag, sir? - What happened, chum? - He went up there. I think it's Gregory. - Fire, police, or ambulance? - Oh, the police. Metropolitan Police? I think a robber has been here. What address are you speaking from? 124 Princess Gardens. I come in tonight to feed the fishes for Sir Malcolm MacKinnon. I'm the housekeeper. Name of Anna Berg. I see the kitchen door was ajar and the light coming from the icebox, and… and on the table… ls there anyone else in the house at the moment? No, no, Sir Malcolm is in Spain, and on the table, I find a little sack, er, full of different keys. Many, many keys. Do you think the man may still be there? Oh, I don't know. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? This is all I need, seeing you. What made you come here? You look as if you've been struck by lightning. I need some help, Mike. Well, you've come to the right place, haven't you? Look at all this deafening prosperity. It's the penalty of legitimacy, that's what it is. I go straight, I settle down, I buy a club, and look what happens. All I can afford for a floor show is a jackdaw on a ball. Thank you, Rosa. I'm losing money hand over fist. It can't be just the food. There must be something the matter with me. Look, I don't need money. Supposing you're pinched here? How do I come out of it? I've got a record. Harboring an escaped convict, I'd be out of business overnight. Listen, all I need is somewhere to stay. Anything you do for me, I'll pay you for. - Now or later? - Later but well. Chicken livers, sir. OK, then, Greg. I'll mock up something for you. You've done me a couple of good turns. I owe it to you. Who cares about that? I need the money. You hang on here. I'll be right back. Good evening, Mr. Milligan. Oh, don't get up. I'm just going. I just thought I'd wish you luck. With your new book? Oh. Thanks. Coming, Bridget? Ciao, Mr. Milligan. Ciao. All fixed. Rosa'll take care of you for tonight. - Who's Rosa? - She's the girl who brought the drinks. I told her you were a friend of mine from the States. Tomorrow we'll make other arrangements. - How soon can I leave? - She's in a taxi outside now. It's a mews flat. Now, wait there till I call you in the morning. Thanks, Mike. My name's Rosa. What's yours? Paul. - Do you go to that place much? - Not often. Suppose it's all right, if you don't mind that bird. I'm not prejudiced, mind you, but I can't stand the bird. So, he left me in Liverpool without a suitcase or a change of clothes. Come on up. Then I came to London and rubbed up against Mr. Cameron. He's been very good to me. It's a nice place he's got there, except for that bird. Make yourself at home. I'll not keep you long. Mind you, it's only temporary, what I'm doing now. I'm trying to get a bit of money saved up. - Do you know any dukes, Paul? - Not intimately. Was that a crack? No, but Mr. Cameron introduced me to one last night. Lovely little feller. He told me he could eat me with a spoon. I think he must have heard it somewhere. Do you think a feller like that would treat a girl well? - I'm sure he would, Rosa. - Well, that's something anyway. Would you like a drink or something? - I'm teetotal myself. - No, thanks. You're one of them Americans, aren't you? Ah, that's where the money is. When I've saved up enough, do you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna buy myself a riding school. - Sounds funny, doesn't it? - Not if you like horses. Oh, I was brought up among them. Should we have a hand of cards to be going on with? I don't know about you, Rosa, but I'm going to get some sleep. You don't like me very much, do you? I think you're very nice. Oh, well. Please yourself. - You mind if I use your phone? - Help yourself. Is Mr. Sullivan at home? Yes, I know it's late, but this is very important. Tell him I'm a friend of George Bendel's. Mr. Sullivan? Sorry to get you out of bed. I called you earlier and you were out. I'm a friend of George's, and I'd… I'd like to see you. It's… it's pretty urgent. No, I, um… I couldn't come to the office. Well, I… I was hoping that you could make it earlier. Yeah, OK, OK. Admiralty Arch, the Mall side, 9.30 tomorrow morning. Well, it's… it's a Jag, isn't it? Don't worry. I'll recognize you. Er… thanks. Mind that car! Mr. Sullivan? - You Gregory? - How did you know? Giving George's name helped. Greg? Thanks. Well, you know the spot I'm in. The money's safe, but I'll need help to get it. I have to have somewhere to stay for a couple of nights, and then I'll need a passport, and that's all it is. I, er… have a proposition to make, Sullivan. Not for me, you haven't, mate. You don't know what I'm going to say yet. That's right, and I don't want to. You're too warm for me, mate. Much too warm. When did you leave Sloane's place, Greg? Yesterday night. Why? That's a nice scarf you're wearing. - Yes, it's his. - I know it is. If I was you, the sooner I got rid of it, the better I'd like it. I still don't get it. Is there something I'm missing? Sloane's dead. What do you mean, he's dead? Tell him. The porter found him last night, him and a girl tied up in a bedroom, his false teeth rammed halfway down his throat. He was dead before they got him to hospital. I didn't know. Sloane died unconscious. Didn't say a word. That's just what they put out, George. Sloane could have said a lot before he died. Did he know where your money was, Greg? Yes, he did. They can't get it. If they know where it is, neither can you. - It's an even chance. - That girl gave your description. Plus, the fact is, she told the cops that you broke into the flat, bashed Sloane, and threatened to kill both of them. Then you tied them up and blew. That's what she said. I got a duty to people like you, mate, but it don't go as far as murder. I tied 'em up. What's that got to do with murder? You know your law, son. If you use violence doing a felony and somebody dies, that's murder. There ain't much more to say, is there? Well, good luck, mate. All you got to remember, you're on your own. Nobody's gonna be on your side when it comes to doing anything much. George, give him 20. Will you step this way, Mr. Savage? There's something wrong with this lock. Let me try. That's very strange. Will you have it checked? I'm in a hurry. Hm. Excuse me just a moment, sir. Where did you get this key, Mr. Savage? What do you mean, where did I get it? I got it here. You gave it to me. I'm afraid not, Mr. Savage. We issued this key to a gentleman only yesterday afternoon. Oh, I see. Um… was it a Mr. Sloane or a Mr. Henderson? We are not permitted to divulge the name of our clients. How did you come by this key, Mr. Savage? Er, Sloane and Henderson are… are business colleagues of mine. We must have gotten our keyrings mixed up. - That's what must've happened. - Perhaps we ought to telephone. No. There's no need. I'll be seeing them this evening. It's all most unfortunate, sir. I hope you get your own key back all right. I have a pretty good idea of where it is. Pst. Vittorio! Ciao, Giullietta. Ciao. Ciao, Vittorio. Ciao. - Hello? - Miss Howard? Yes. Who's that? Philip Milligan. I don't know whether you remember me. I remember the voice. Hello? Hello? You still there? I have to see you. Are you alone? Why do you have to see me? I think you know why. If you don't, just hang up and forget that I called. - Where are you? - Kensington air terminal. Well, you'd better come up here, if you think that's all right. I have to talk to you first. It'll take you ten minutes by car from where you are now. All right, I'll see you in ten minutes. I'll be waiting by the news stand. Iberia Spanish Airways announce the departure of their flight 446 for Barcelona. I'm sorry about this, Miss Howard. You're Paul Gregory, aren't you? I called you from outside your flat. I had to be sure you were coming alone. I followed you here. - Who would I have come with? - You might've called the police. Or you might have told them to meet you here. I had to be sure. - Are you sure? - I think so. I knew who you were last night at the club. Where do you want to go? Let's just drive around for a while. Anywhere. I called you because I need help. Will you tell me why it had to be me? Because there's no one left now. You're the only person I know who isn't a cop or a thief. - Did you kill that man? - No. You've got to believe that. Oh, look, this is ridiculous. Everything about me is wrong for you. Just drop me off somewhere and… I'm sorry I called you. What do your friends call you? Paul? Greg. All right, Greg. Get out. If that's the way you want it. I want you to get in front with me. All right? Now. let's stop being phony. You don't have to play on my sympathy. You've already got it. I'd have helped you last night at the club if I'd have known how. What you've got to decide is if you're going to trust me. What else can I do? All right. Then that's settled. What shall we do? Can you go back to Michael's? No, the police'll be there. It's in Sloane's name. We'll go to my place. Do you live alone? Yes. I have a cleaner who comes in in the morning, but I can put her off. Good. And then you called me? Then I called you. And that's the full story. - Greg? - Yeah? I'm out of my depth. All I know is that we've got to hide you. After that, my mind gives out. It's a complete blank. What do we do next? I don't know. If I can last for a few weeks, they'll have started to forget about me. This country's hard to break out of, but they can't make it leak-proof. It's getting late. You'd better get some sleep. Do you want a blanket? No, thanks. Will you sleep? Like a baby. Good night. Hello? From Tangier? Yes, I'll take it. Hello, Michael? Darling, you don't have to tell me you're drunk. I'm not being testy. I'm just sleepy. Yes, I'm sure it's terrific, darling. Look, Michael, I can't. I've got problems too. Well, write me a letter about it in the morning. - He wants me to join him in Tangier. - Well, are you going to? I might. If I really thought I could help. - You think he needs you? - Don't be so cynical. Did he wake you up? No, I haven't slept. Neither have I. I've been thinking and I've had an idea. We live in Wales. We've been there for years. One of my uncles is Chief Constable. Just plain folks, huh? Anyway, our house is in Brecon, and I said I might go down this weekend. On our land, there's a shepherd's cottage, miles away from anywhere up in the hills. No one ever goes there. You could stay there as long as you liked. It sounds great. How do we get there? It'll take eight hours. I'll drive you. There'll be all sorts of things you'll need. I'll look after that. You'd better get some sleep. I'll wake you when everything's fixed. - Good night. - Good night. And, er, thanks. - Greg? - Yeah. What makes you so sure I won't let you down? I'm not sure. I wouldn't be surprised if you did. I wouldn't blame you for it either. I couldn't live like that, always expecting the worst, never trusting anybody. Cutting yourself off from… - Decent human society? - From any human society. - It isn't natural. - It's a matter of choice. I'm going to pull in for some petrol. Is that all right? Yeah. Make it as fast as you can, though. - Five gallons, please. - Five gallons it is. Let that dog out, will you, George? - You going far tonight? - No, not very. You want to watch out for the road around Brecon. Covered with ice it is. - Watch out for that Brecon road. - How much do I owe you? That'll be one pound, one shilling, and fourpence. - Thank you. Keep the change. - Thank you very much. - Keep going. - But what about... I said keep going! Nothing else we could do. - I don't want to talk about it. - We've got to talk about it. They've probably got your number. The police'll be checking it. Supposing it'd been a child. Would we have stopped or... I don't know, but it wasn't. Supposing it had been your friend, Mr. Sloane? Look, I'm sorry. I'm getting hysterical. You'd better drive for a while. Tell me what we have to do. They'll have the number. Where's the car registered? Cardiff. It's in Daddy's name. That means the police may call at your home today. You'd better be there. They'll ask you about the man who was with you in the car. Act surprised, then remember that you picked up a hitchhiker in Monmouth and dropped him in Brecon. You don't know anything about him except that he had a Welsh accent and, er… he didn't make a pass at you. The cottage is up there. Just about a quarter of a mile away. - Where's the house? - Well, it's down in the valley. About a mile. You can just see it from the cottage window. I'll get the stuff out. Greg, you'd better take these. You follow that cart track until you come to a stream. You go on another 100 yards and you'll come to the cottage. When shall I see you again? Not until you're sure it's safe. Don't take any chances. I won't. Bridget. If they catch up with you, tell them I made you do it. Tell them I had a gun. Don't worry. I won't let you down. Ciao, Greg. - Ciao. - Take care. - Hello, Miss Bridget. - Hello, Gwyneth. Your Uncle Tom's been asking for you. Oh? - Ah, there you are, Bridget. - Hello, Uncle Tom. Inspector Scott, this is my niece Bridget. - How do you do, Miss Howard? - How do you do? I'm afraid I'm here in an official capacity. Inspector Scott has come from London with a few questions to ask you. Just one question, really, sir. Won't you sit down? Do you know a man called Paul Gregory? Paul Gregory? I don't think so. Who is he? He escaped from prison four days ago. Oh, yes, I read about it. Yes, I think most of us did. And you're sure you don't know him? No. How could I? Have you been to the Glee Club in Motcomb Place, Miss Howard? Yes. When was the last time you were there? I don't know. Not long ago. I'm asking you because a Mr. Lawrence Hunter has... Oh, yes, Larry Hunter. He took me there the other night. That was three nights ago, wasn't it? What's all this about? Well, Miss Howard, the owner of the club, Mr. Cameron, claims he saw you on Tuesday night talking to a man he identifies as Paul Gregory. But I told you. I went with Larry Hunter. We had dinner and then we left. And you didn't talk to anyone? There was the waiter. The hat-check girl. And I said good evening to Mr. Cameron. And there was a man who asked me for a light. What man was that? I don't know. It was as we were leaving. He got up from his table and asked if I could give him a light. I thought he was trying to pick me up. I told him he could go to hell. I can't remember my exact words. Ciao? Have I got it right, Miss Howard? It's an Italian expression, sir. According to Mr. Cameron, it's an affectionate form of greeting or farewell, chiefly used among intimates. Did I say that? I must've been tight. In fact, it's more than likely. Mm. Well, I wonder if you'd pop down to the station so we can get this in writing. Won't this all keep till tomorrow, Inspector? It won't take long, sir. It's OK, Uncle. Let's get it over with. What are you doing here? Are you all right, mate?
