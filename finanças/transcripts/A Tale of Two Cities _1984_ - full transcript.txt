Good evening, Mr. Lorry. I have received a letter from the bank with regard to the estate of my dear late father. Pray, take a seat, Miss Manette. The letter said that a trip to Paris may be necessary to conclude this business. That is so, my dear. It is also necessary to tell you my role in this. I would appreciate that, sir. As an officer of Tellson's, I have been responsible for managing your affairs since you were brought from France as an orphan nearly 20 years ago. That I know, sir. Miss Manette, it was I who brought you to England as a babe in fulfillment of your mother's last wish that you be made a ward of Tellson's bank. You have grown up not knowing a great deal about your poor father. I hope that what I have to say won't upset you. I am anxious to hear your story. I tell of France where decent people live in fear of a cruel and oppressive aristocracy. For more than 20 years, they have suffered the outrages of a corrupt nobility which can deprive a man of his life or liberty at a whim. Mr. Lorry, is that what happened to my father? I'm afraid it is. Prepare yourself for a shock, Lucille. We have news of your father's whereabouts. -But, I thought he was... -Yes. He was believed dead, but I'm happy to tell you that that's not so. He has been locked away in the Bastille for all these years. Why, Mr. Lorry? Why? Why in that terrible place? That I cannot answer, my dear, but he is alive and free. Although, I fear, not very well. Twenty years in a French prison has affected him very badly. But he is alive? Yes, Lucille. Your father is alive. He is staying with a man who once worked for him. A Monsieur Defarge who owns a wine shop in Paris. Ah. Miss Manette! Miss Manette! Allow me, sir. I am Miss Manette's companion. She will be all right now. I must apologize, madam. Had I know that you were traveling with Miss Manette, I would've asked you to join us. As it is, I am thankful that you arrived when you did. Thank you, Miss Pross. I'm feeling better now. I was just not prepared to hear such wonderful news. Mr. Lorry, I must go to him immediately. In that case, I shall book passage on the morning boat to Callay.

And is it not true that you followed your patriotic duty when you found certain documents in the prisoner's possession? Yes, sir. I reported it to your office. What were those documents? Troop lists, sir. I believe that you had occasion to travel with the prisoner to coastal areas where the troops were militant whilst awaiting...? Your witness, Mr. Stryver. Mr. Barsad, have you ever been a spy? No. How do you make your living? From my property. Did you inherit it? Yes. From a relation? Yes. -Ever been in prison? -Never. My Lord, I object to Mr. Stryver's line of questioning. It has no relevance to this case. Your Worship, if I may continue, I will demonstrate that this witness is not the honest, upstanding gentleman that Mr. Attorney General would have us believe. I will show that he has been in the employ of someone who wishes to discredit Mr. Darnay. (crowd yelling) (gavel pounds) Continue, Mr. Stryver. Have you ever been in prison? No. Not even in the debtors' prison? Well, yes. How many times? Once or twice. You sir, in fact, have been there on five or six occasions. Have you ever lived by gambling? No more than any other gentleman. Have you ever cheated at dice? Never. Never been thrown downstairs for cheating? Never--I once tripped and fell down of my own accord. Have you ever borrowed money from the prisoner? Yes. -Did you pay him back? -No. Have you ever been employed by the government? Never. Never been paid for laying traps? Oh, dear, no! -Are you sure? -Yes. I put it to you, sir, that you were short of funds and fabricated this evidence in order to raise money. That is not true. I'm afraid, sir, we have no way of establishing the truth but in my opinion you are an abject liar. I believe there is nothing you wouldn't say to further your own ends. Mr. Lorry, on that Friday in November, were you a passenger on the London to Dover coach? I was. Look now at the prisoner. Was he not on the same coach? There were two men on the coach. Both were well wrapped against the cold. I did not see their faces. You returned from France by ship? Yes, I did. Did you see the prisoner on this journey? I saw him go off the ship. What time did he arrive at the dock? At a little after midnight. So, at the dark hour of midnight, you saw the prisoner sneak aboard? You're trying to put words into my mouth. He boarded the ship as an ordinary passenger would. Were you traveling alone? I was in the company of Dr. Manette and his daughter. I should like to call Miss Manette. Miss Manette, please step forward. (crowd talking) -You are Miss Lucille Manette? -Yes, sir. Have you seen the prisoner before? Yes, sir... On the ship you referred to. Was there anyone with him? Yes. There were two other men. Did you see them whispering between themselves? I think I may have but I could hear nothing of what they said. Did you see the prisoner handing papers to these other men? It was very dark. I could see very little but I think he did. Miss Manette, could you tell the court of your encounter with the prisoner? Sir, I employ you, do not think badly of Mr. Darnay. He cannot be guilty of this crime. That is for the court to decide. I ask you again, to describe the events of that night. When the gentleman came on... You mean the prisoner, Miss Manette? As you wish, sir. The prisoner came on board. (rain) ♪ He noticed my father was in a weak state of health and offered to assist me in finding shelter for him, away from the wind and rain. As the trip progressed, he confided in me that he was in France on business of a delicate nature that concerned his family. He told me he traveled quite often to France. He always went under an assumed name to avoid being recognized. I must interrupt you to ask if the prisoner spoke of matters concerning America? Yes, he did. Oh, heaven help me, he did! Miss Manette, I'm sure the prisoner understands that you must tell the truth. Well, he spoke of England's quarrel in America and told me that he thought it was folly for the English to be there but it was said as a jest, I'm sure. Please continue, Miss Manette. He said that George Washington would possibly, one day, be as famous as King George III but, mark you, he also talked of France. He told me conditions there were very harsh and how deeply he felt for the people he'd left behind. Your Worship, if I may point out something of importance? Any conversation Miss Manette had with Mr. Darnay on route from France is beside the point. Darnay is accused of spying on troop barracks in England. The witnesses to that claim only to have seen him from a distance. I ask that my associate Mr. Carton, step to the front of the court. Mr. Carton, please stand beside Mr. Darnay. Do you not see a strong resemblance? I do not deny that a man may have been seen spying on our forces, but what I ask is, could you convict my client of such a serious offense when it could so easily have been a matter of mistaken identity? Gentlemen of the jury, we've heard the testimony of over 20 witnesses. The Attorney General has put forward a persuasive argument which, unfortunately, relies too much, in my opinion, on circumstance and supposition. I would caution you to ponder this case carefully. An ill-considered verdict could send an innocent man to a terrible death. On the other hand, if you're convinced the charges are fully proven, then you must find the prisoner guilty. Hang him! You will retire now to consider the evidence. (crowd yelling) ♪ Traitor, murderer! Hang him! (gavel pounds) The prisoner will stand. Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

To the lady who showed such sympathy and compassion this very day. A toast to the very beautiful Miss Manette. (glasses clanking) Miss Manette. I have a question. Do you think I like you? No. I don't think you do. Do you think I'm drunk? I think that you have been drinking. And you shall know why? I care for no man on earth, for no man cares for me. Much to be regretted.

When were these new laws passed? Four days ago. But that was when I left England. No matter. It is now the law. You are under arrest. ♪ ♪ (crowd yelling) ♪ It's a good thing you could get here so quickly. Mr. Lorry, where is Charles? In a prison not too far from here. Is he in good health? I haven't been allowed to see him but I had a message to say that he's as well as can be, all things considered. What are they going to do with him? Don't worry, my dear. I'll think of some way to get him released. ♪ Surely my eyes deceive me. It is Dr. Manette, is it not? Yes, it is, Ernest. How are you, my friend? I am well, Doctor, and pleased to see you in such good health. Allow me. Thank you, Ernest. Tell me. What has brought you to Paris? My son-in-law has been imprisoned here. Charles Darnay? You know him? He was brought to me as an illegal immigrant. Under the new laws, he must answer this charge in court. What can I do to help him? After your suffering at the hands of the aristocrats, perhaps you could speak on his behalf? Your pleas might carry some weight. I shall try that. I saw old Dr. Manette today. He's come here to try to help Darnay and he's brought Lucille with him. He shouldn't have bothered. Nothing can save that man from the guillotine. You women are all obsessed with that dreadful contraption. We are only obsessed with justice. I like to see those fine bodies separated from their heads. You'll be there again in the morning, I suppose. Of course I will. ♪ (crowd yelling) ♪ (crowd yelling) ♪ Pull the guillotine! ♪ Surely the trial must be over by now. Now, try to calm down. Mr. Lorry will get a message to us as soon as they reach a verdict. Oh! Sit down and try not to worry. (knocking) Who is it? Jerry Cruncher, ma'am. Mr. Lorry sent me. Come in, Jerry. Mr. Darnay has been acquitted. Oh, thank heavens! (gasp) It was the Doctor's words that did it. He spoke out for Mr. Darnay and the jury took pity on him. When can I see my husband? Dr. Manette will bring him here, ma'am, as soon as the papers are signed. He told me to warn you that all this time in prison has done your husband's health no good. What did they do to him? Nothing that a few days' rest won't put right. We thank you for delivering this message, sir, and our thanks, too, to Mr. Lorry. I'll tell him that, ma'am. Good day. Oh, Charles! My poor darling! I'm so relieved you're out of that place. For the moment, yes, my dear, but we can't be sure it won't happen again. They're determined to make me pay for the crimes of my family. But there can be no guilt attached to you. My guilt is that I was born into the aristocracy. They will never forgive me for this, and now that I've been freed of the first charge, they'll try even harder. That is true. We must arrange to leave France as soon as you are well enough to travel. And that won't be before you've eaten a few decent meals. I'll arrange a dinner to celebrate your return to us. A splendid idea. (banging) Out of my way, you big hag. I beg your pardon. What is the meaning of this outrage? That's him. Arrest that man. No! You must be mistaken! Keep out of this! Am I again to be a prisoner? You will appear before the tribunal tomorrow. What crime is he charged with? He is accused of being an enemy of the Republic. Who accuses him? You will find out tomorrow. ♪ ♪ (crowd talking) ♪ We've heard from citizen Defarge and his wife that the man who calls himself Charles Darnay is, in fact, Charles Evremonde Darnay. If you of the deceased Marquis Darnay, I believe there is one other accuser. Who is that person? The accuser is Dr. Alexandre Manette. This is absurd. It is well known that Charles Darnay is the husband of my daughter. I have not and would not make any such accusation. This document will reveal the truth. I found this in Dr. Manette's old cell in the North Tower of the Bastille. I would like you to hear this. "I, Alexandre Manette, am unhappily imprisoned as a result of the injustices against me. I was called one evening to the chateau of the family Darnay. ♪ I attended a young maiden who had tried to take her own life. I could do nothing for her. I was then shown a lad near to death with a stab wound. The Marquis had despoiled the maiden and stabbed her brother when he sought to protect her. I did what I could but he died soon after. Before I could report this to the authorities, I was arrested and thrown into prison. ♪ I declare that the family Darnay is evil and must be punished for its crimes against the people and myself." (crowd yelling) Charles Evremonde Darnay, now called Charles Darnay, you've heard the evidence against you. Have you anything to say? I admit I'm a Darnay but I have nothing to do with the atrocities described before you. They were crimes of my dead uncle, whose name I rejected many years ago. I renounced all claims to title and fortune in disgust at the behavior of the Darnay family and its crimes against the people of France. Charles Darnay, you have admitted to being a member of the accused family. You are sentenced to die on the guillotine two weeks from this day. You will be confined in the Bastille until the day of your death. (birds chirping) ♪ This is the third time this week you've been here. You'll never see him from here. No matter if I see him. It's more important that he sees me. Fifty-two today. Fifty-two what? Heads. Fifty-two heads taken off by madam le guillotine today. I'll thank you to keep such information to yourself. This is my little guillotine. If those logs were aristocrats... ♪ I'd have France rid of them all within a week. ♪ Come away, my dear. This will not help Charles. Nothing can help him now. We've tried everything. But Father, he is to die in the morning. (laughing) Lucille, my dear, I'm afraid we must face the inevitable. Charles is lost to us. No! No! No! (crying) ♪ Pssst! Oh, Mr. Carton, you nearly scared me to death. Calm down, Jerry. What are you doing here, sir? I hope to help, Jerry. Not much you can do, sir. ♪ Let me go! If I hadn't heard that Barsad the spy was dead and buried, I'd swear you were he. Who are you? I'm a turn key at the Bastille. You're English? I live in Paris now. Ever known a man called John Barsad? He's dead. I put him in his coffin meself. Mr. Carton, sir, he's lying. I think so, too, but how do you know for sure? I was on a medical errand and found John Barsad's coffin. It was full of stones. Barsad, one move and we'll expose you for the spy you are. Oh no, sir! They'll have my head off. Don't do that! Not if you do as I tell you. Do you understand what you're to do, Barsad? Yes, I do. Go to Mr. Lorry's house, Jerry, and tell him to be ready to leave at first light. He should not stop until he reaches the coast. He is to take everyone, including you, with him. Is that clear? As a bell, Mr. Carton. As clear as a bell. ♪ Poor, brave, Carton. If he's God, he can do it. I really hope he can, Jerry. I think he's taking a terrible risk. And with no guarantee that it will work. If they find him there, there'll be two heads removed instead of just one. It seems so wrong that even one man shall die particularly when the both of them are innocent. God knows that, Mr. Lorry. ♪ (horse neighing) Have you arranged things? At the risk of my own life, I will take you to him. ♪ ♪ This is far as I go. As you wish. Unlock the door. ♪ How? How did you? Never mind. I'm here to get you out. It's impossible. No one ever escapes from the Bastille. I have a plan you need know nothing of. Now, sit down and remove your shoes quickly. ♪ ♪ (two knocks) ♪ If you fail me now, I shall denounce you as a traitor to the revolution. And you must keep your part of the bargain. If they find out I've helped you... You just get him to the coach waiting outside. If anyone stops you, just say that he's been overcome with grief after visiting his condemned friend. And you will go to the guillotine in his place? Yes. Why? That is my business, spy. ♪ ♪ Take him away from here as fast as you can. Have no fear about that. (whip cracks) ♪ Do you know how they arranged my husband's escape? I would prefer not to. He looks so ill. I think they used chloroform. He should revive quite soon. What's that in his pocket? ♪ "If you remember the words that passed between us, you will understand why I do this." Oh, Sydney! Oh God, help poor, dear Sydney! He offers his life in exchange for our happiness. (crying) ♪ (crowd yelling) (drum roll) (swoosh) (crowd yelling) (ominous music) ♪ ♪ It is a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done. It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known. ♪ Kill him! (crowd yelling) (drum roll) (swoosh) ♪ ♪
