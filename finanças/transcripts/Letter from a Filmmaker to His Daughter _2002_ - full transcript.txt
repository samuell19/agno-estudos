LETTER OF A FILMAKER TO HIS DAUGHTER Sound. Sound rolling. Image. Rolling. Clapper. Okay. One day my daughter asked me why I wasn't making films for her, why I wasn't makingfilms for children. I told her that I couldn't, that it was impossible for me... because it was such a long time since I was a child, and I was no longer that child. And my films, which I first made in the spirit of research, helped me to find myself, and to try to express my relationship with the world and with others. But from her question and from her desire, there was a desireto answer her, to tell her the stories I've always wished to tell. Some friends send me a parcel from Cuba, so that the God Ellegua could help me to make this film. Prepare three small packages with a fish caughtby a clothes peg. Put a needle through its eyes and put them witha clove of garlic. Bind the packages with tight red and white string, and then put them at the end of the day, on the three street corners which surround your house. If he is in the mood, Ellegua will then help you to disoriente your enemies. Make a fourth package with a key, a sea snail, a chain, seven pepper seeds and seven raisins. Surround it by white cord and keep it behind your door for seven days. Throw it in a river which flows towards the sea or on a railway in a Southern direction. Mark the place with an arrow using powdered egg shells. Then smoke the cigar: its odour will awake Ellegua wherever he is. I write so I can make a film for you. I write to share with you images and sounds, to tell you the stories that I want to tell you... I write to tell you about the cinema that I like. It is the cinema of craftsmen, of solitude, like a painter almost. A cinema of respect. Of thought, of sharing... rather than the cinema of power and entertainment. You see, the baker, I always knew he was a baker, since I bought bread from his place... but he didn't know that I made films, I had not told him because I am so ashamed of what the cinema does, and of what television shows. And his son knew for a long time that his father was a baker. But you, you learned later, that I was making films. Autumn. Portrait of Mohamed, bath boy. Sharing of a moment. For me, to film is primarily to observe the other, the face of the other, but also the tracks of the other, here or elsewhere, on the landscape. And if I had to film somebody who works in the cinema, I would make a portrait of Roger, whose face is never seen on screen and who spends his time looking at the faces of others of which he calibrates the colour in the laboratory. This man, this doctor of whom I make the portrait, is the first man who touched you with his hands. And when your mother was carrying you, at the first appointment, he showed us how and where you were: it was a drawing by Leonard: the first image of you. Of all the storiesthat I want to tell you, there is the story ofthis small clay dish on which are engraved the first remnants of writing. It was in Sumer 5 000 years ago. For more than 20 years, searchers tried to find out what it meant... and finally succeeded in deciphering: "Here, there were four goats." As the footprints left by the birds near the ponds resembled their writing the Sumarians believed that gods and spirits were leaving them messages. But of course, all this was in disorder... If one could have read those signs one would have known the history of the world. This view is the only portrait of the Japanese painter Utamaro. The only image of this man hidden behind the woman he paints and loves. The poem written on the fan tells the story of a heron attracted by the flesh of a half opened shell: it plunges its beak in, but the shell closes on it, and the bird remains a prisoner of its own desire. There is also the story of this sultan who lived in the South of Persia in the 10th century, and who had one of the largest libraries of the time: 120 000 books. But he remained a nomad and sometimes left his palace to return to the desert sands. And as he could not leave his books behind, he had them loaded on to camels, and each camel corresponded to a letter of the alphabet. But the extraordinary thing was that the camels were also trained to walk in alphabetical order. More than 100 years ago, on the Ural plain, near the small village of Tabori, a gigantic meteorite had landed: a mass of more than 4 000 kilos: the famous Okhanski meteorite, today it has completely disappeared. When scientists went to look for it, they found nothing. Over a century, piece by piece, the inhabitants of the village had eaten it all, convinced by the aphrodisiac virtues of the meteorite ! Even the one kilo fragment exhibited in the Orkesk museum, the main town of the Okhanski district, had also disappeared. This is not a story, but just an image that I'd like to show you. The image of a window in a small village of the Jura. A window behind which a woman took care of and fed for 27 years, her son, who was run down by a car and plunged into a coma. 27 years, day after day, she held him in her arms. Image for a Pieta. And what image to show for this man who killed his child ? With the agreement of his wife, he went to the Chicago hospital... In the hospital ward where his baby was on a life support machine, his 9month old baby who had been in an irreversible coma since birth... Then, after having disconnected the appliances, he held the hospital personnel at bay with his gun... Aiming at them with his weapon, he cuddled his baby in his arms until it died. I found no image for this story. But I wanted to bring you back another image from over there, a strange and sad image of the burial of a clown. I will tell you something that happened to me lately... I was on stage, performing... And with an awkward gesture, I broke my ankle! Broken, broken! I continued the number, but... creeping along the floor! I had to make such an effort just to leave the stage ! And people laugh at all that! People see a clown limping trying to get off stage, going towards the curtain, trying to disappear, that is a comic effect !... And more than that, you pass the curtain and who do you meet? The director of the circus who says: "Tomorrow, you'll do the same"! So for three weeks, with my broken foot, I do the same number. At one moment, I break my foot, and I have to go off with this comic effect... with my broken foot !" It reminds me of two stories, one short and one long. In the short one, you were young, one day you came and stood in front of me in the living room, you were dressed up as a fairy. In one hand you held a magic wand with a star on top, and in the other you held, a rubber I believe. You stood quite seriously in front of me and you announced that you were going to do some magic, that you were going to make the rubber vanish. Then suddenly you said: "Watch out!" and you repeated your magic spell three times, holding the rubber very tightly in your hand. Then, very proudly, you opened your hand slowly and looked curiously at it: naturally the rubberwas still there ! Then you said, sad and disappointed: "it didn't work!" And you went back to your room. I then realised that you really believed that it would have worked. The other long story is about a bird who could sing marvellously. One day, in North Africa, near an oasis, a man heard a bird singing like he had never heard before, something unique, marvellous. He looked for the house from where it had came. He then went and knocked on the door. Two old people opened. He asked the couple whether this extraordinary song came from their house. They said: "yes, come in". They showed him the bird in the cage, the wonderful singer. He offered them a good price for it, but they refused. He doubled his offer, tripled it even, but they kept refusing. Then, disappointed, he left. The next day, in the small closed city, at the bird market, he sees exactly the same bird: it doesn't sing, but it is exactly the same. He buys it and the idea of a substitution comes into his mind. Then in the afternoon, he returned to the oasis and waited. And after the old people went out, he entered the house and exchanged the birds. Then he returned to Europe, and brought the bird back home. And for years, he and his friends listened to the bird singing, and his life was a delight. But one day, naturally, the bird died... and reconsidering the whole story, he had some regrets... and decided to return to Africa. When he arrived at the oasis, and knocked on the door, the old man opened it. He said: "Do you remember me, years ago..." Oh yes! said the old man, I remember... Years ago you wanted to buy our bird who sang so well. Well, it was lucky that you didn't buy it... because the day after you left, my wife died, and the bird never sang again. You see, I believe that in the future images will travel through space. One will be able to see and take images over vast distances, to the stars, to go backwards in time. Then images will not only show us space, but they will also tell us about time, the passing of time. When man first came out of Africa, some left for Europe and others for Asia. Generation to generation passed from Asia to America, and populated all of the American continent, from North to South, by walking across the Bering Straits, which collapsed 20 000 years ago. 20 000 years later, Christopher Colombus, arrived from Europe to the new continent's islands. Indians saw on the horizon the white sails of the boats. And facing these vessels coming from another time, or from beyond perhaps, the wizards, the shamans of the tribe took their telescopic tubes which, in their trance, enabled them to go back in time. And from his boat, Christopher Colombus saw in his telescope men looking at him. A moment of suspense. For one instant, after 20 000 years of separation, a face to face meeting took place, a moment of equality between those who were looking at the space and those who were looking at the time. This man in this cafï¿½ this man everywhere in Prague, it is Kafka, the writer Franz Kafka. Towards the end of his life, something happened to him I would like to tell you. One day, while he was walking, he saw a small girl who was crying in a park. He approached her and asked the reason for her tears. She said that she lost her doll, her most beautiful one, hers. Then Kafka asks for the name of the doll, and the small girl answers: "Anna". Then Kafka said: "there is a doll called Anna who has just written me a letter". And Kafka asks her whether she will come back to the park the next day... Then the next day, and every day for the weeks that followed, Kafka brings the small girl a letter from Anna, a traveller who tells of her adventures. When Kafka, now sick, had to return to the sanatorium, he wrote as if he was the doll, a last letter in which she tells that she had found a friend, that she will get married in the world of the dolls... and will continue her journey. When I filmed these images, you were by my side... And I felt like reproducing what you were looking at: A feeling of passage, of disappearance. As one day all traces will vanish... along with any writing. As Jussieu's work disappeared... Joseph de Jussieu, in 1735, took part in one of the most incredible expeditions ever tried: a team of ten men sent by the royal Science Academy was going to cross the Atlantic to get to the Andes to measure the arc of the meridian. The expedition itself was a foolhardy adventure which lead to a 10 year crossing of Amazonia. But the most incredible destiny was to be Jussieu's. As a doctor and naturalist in the expedition, he stayed with the Indians, living with them, looking after them, indexing each plant, each animal, discovering the secrets of medicines... While his mates had already returned home long ago, he stayed, going further into the Amazonian forest, bringing back wonders that he added to his collection. For 36 years, he would gather extraordinary and unique knowledge... then he returned, sick, exhausted, half insane to Quito, where he was found. Peruvian friends ended up taking him back to France but they forgot the valuable cases containing his work. Jussieu spent the end of his life cloistered in his chamber. And all efforts to find his work will be useless. Nobody knows what happened to the cases left in Peru... where nobody remembers Jussieu anymore. For us, everything has disappeared. But you can perhaps find everything in yourself... As each one of us can find in his own labyrinth the whole history of humanity. I ended up making the film that you wanted: it is a terrifying and terrible story like the ones little girls like. These tragic and dramatic stories, are the first ones that children imagine... and they are the first stories that the cinema explored, in black and white, when it was still square... Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess. But one day there was a terrible fire... And she lost her parents. In her despair, she finds a friend... And a new home. Almost happiness. But one day, a merchant of children... The return of the friend. Months pass. But one day... They find each other again. A short happiness So much time spent in obscurity made her blind. But one day... She recognises the perfume of her mother who wasn't dead. Her parents, rich, have her treated. And the miracle happens. Happiness, at last! The end. But you see, for me, to make an image, is a way of approaching daily life. Like this moment at the corner of my street, with the grocer who walks out, sees the camera and makes a sign. I would like to give you a final story and then a song... This is a story about women, a women's story ... The first one written in French in the XII century... It tells the story of Sire Gauvain, one of the Knights of the Round Table, brought together around King Arthur. Amongst all, he was a man of his word. One day, as Gauvain was returning by horse towards King Arthur's castle, a terrifying monster, stood in front of him. The giant wanted to fight him, but Gauvain cried that he was a man of his word, and not a man of the sword... "Never mind, said the giant, I will ask you a question, only one and if you cannot answer it, you will die ! Here is my question: "What is the desire of any woman?". Gauvain, not knowing the answer, asks for some time. As he was a man of his word, he would come back. The giant made an appointment for one year, day for day, and leaves. On the way to the King's castle, Gauvain is stopped by a repulsive old woman who stands in his way. Never had Gauvain seen an uglier person. She said that she knew him, and that she also knows the answer to the question of the ogre... And she added: "I will give you the right answer, only if you swear to marry me." Gauvain rides his horse towards the castle. When he arrives at the King's Court, the party has already started, Gauvain is questioned on his delay and tells of his adventure. Arthur then exclaims: "You, Gauvain, man of his word! You couldn't answer that question! But what women wish for, is jewels and beauty!". The large Chamberlain steps in, apologises, and says that for him, what women wish for, are not luxuries but dreams, the imaginary, the nocturnal face of the world. But a third, then a fourth intervene... and all evening, each one tells what he knows of women's desires. Days, weeks and months pass and each one, believing they know what women wish for, go to the castle to give Gauvain their answer to the question of the ogre. But Gauvain listens so much to the answers of the others that he thinks little about his own. After a year, he goes, full of doubt, to the appointment. On his way, like the year before, the old woman, even uglier, stops him: So, Gauvain, have you got the answer? I have thousands of answers, said Gauvain. Thousands, but not the right one! Listen to my answer, I'll give it to you. If you return, you must marry me. And she whispers the answer to Gauvain. The ogre is there and waits for the answer to his question. Gauvain gives him the first answer from the King, and the ogre threatens him. But Gauvain stops him and gives the second answer, then the third... all of them, until the last... then he gives the response of the old woman: "What any woman wishes for, is to choose her destiny freely." And the giant collapses in a ball of fire. But Gauvain was a man of his word... After the wedding of which nobody dared to be delighted, After the wedding of which nobody dared to be delighted, he was with her on the first night, he lay at the other end of the large bed. Then he suddenly heard behind him a soft and beautiful voice saying: "Well, Sir Gauvain, is this the way to treat a young spouse on her wedding night". Surprised by the softness of the voice, Gauvain turns round to discover a young woman of dazzling beauty... As he remained speechless, under her charm, she says: "I will also ask you a question, Gauvain,... Do you want me to be beautiful by night and ugly by day, or do you prefer me beautiful by day and ugly by night?". Gauvain thinks, then he says: "I do not have a reply to your question. Perhaps I could have found a reply to the ogre's question... but to your question, there is no possible answer." She looked at him, and said: "I can see that you have really become a man of his word, for you start to measure the limits of your word. So, to please you, I will remain beautiful night and day !". Gauvain lived happy... and they had numerous children. It is the end of this film that I wanted to make for you. A film for the desire and for the pleasure. Just for that. I leave you with this old song that I wanted to give you, with the voices of these men who tell their story... and who are no longer here, but say to yourself that the memory is collective and that death does not exist.
