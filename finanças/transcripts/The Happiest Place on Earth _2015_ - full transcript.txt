(soft music) (tense electronic music) (light music) (paint splattering) (soft tense music) - [Dispatcher] You know, I think it's something that is given to us when we're young, like implanted in us. You graduate college, you get your job, buy a big house, have 2.5 kids, have a fence around your yard, a dog, nice cars. You don't have anything to worry about. - [Boothe] I think everyone still uses like that white picket fence reference, and in everybody's head that's what everybody still wants, you know? Perfect house, perfect family, whatever that family may be. Everybody in their hearts, they want that on a financial level. They want to marry that person that is their true love. - [Don] The goal of this country has always been that everyone can have a home. When World War II ended and the great American middle class started to evolve, the American dream was that you could be a middle-class person, have your own home, have your own four walls, have your own life. You're a king in your castle. Even if the thing's a thousand square feet, it doesn't matter, if it's a nice thousand square feet. - [Peggy] My parents and my generation, they all expected that their children would have more and be able to do more than they were able to provide. Life will progress in such a manner that we're able to have more and to provide more for our families. And that we will not be going backwards. - One of the great things about America, it's one of the few countries that has the least amount of obstacles for anybody to make a home, buy a home, have their family there. My husband and I have been married for 29 years. We have three children, and we're now at the stage where we're witnessing our kids graduating from college, following their own dreams, having their children, doing the whole thing that my husband and I have been doing. The struggles, the triumphs. We believe in our hearts, whatever it is that we want to attain, we can achieve it. (paper shuffling) (children chattering) (soft music) This is a three bedroom, two bath, 1,460 heated square feet, and has a split plan. Master bedroom is over here. There's two smaller bedrooms near the entry. The kitchen is nice but it's sort of plain. Nice, big walk-in closet, right? Take your time, look around, and ask me any questions, okay? - Yeah, just give us a few, please. - Okay. - Thanks. So what do you think? - It's not perfect, but the longer we wait, we won't even be able to afford something like this. - It's more than we talked about. - Yeah, but when we move in, we won't owe on anything else. Hey, don't worry. - I can't not worry. Let's just go. - Hey. - What are you doing? - Come here. Come here. Here we go. Look how tall I am. (both chuckling) (soft music) - [Barack On TV] They believed in an America where hard work paid off and responsibility was rewarded. And anyone could make it if they tried. And these values gave rise to the largest middle class- - What do we still have to do in there? We got the bed in there. We got the bedding in there. That's it for tonight though? - Well, maybe a box or two depending on what time it is. I'm gonna start, you know, putting clothes away. - I'm not gonna stop you. To our lovely home? - Mm-hm. So is it too soon to start talking names? - Ooh! Names. (soft music) - I can't believe this is happening. - On three, okay? - Okay. - Okay. One, two, three. (Maggie breathing heavily) - It was all in your dream, babe. You all right? - I am now. Baby. - Hm? - If something were to happen to you, how long would you want me wait to find somebody new? - Where did that come from? - How long? - Once I'm underground, you can do what you want, but I'm not going anywhere for a while. - Better not. - Yeah, what's my statute of limitations? - Never. You're gonna mourn my death the rest of your life. - So what do we have, five more days to the weekend? - [Jonah] Tell me about it. - [Don] How did your move go? How's the house? - It's great. Won't feel like home till we get the last couple boxes unpacked, but the commute's a lot easier. Couldn't ask for a better deal, so. - Fortune favors the bold. - Somethin' like that. (phone ringing) Production, Jonah speaking. - Jonah Price? - Yes, sir. - [Phil] Got a minute? - Yeah, sure. - Stop by my office. - Yeah, okay, should I- - Thanks. (phone beeping) Mr. Price. Look, there's no real easy way to do this. It's the worst part of my job. Revenue has gotten pretty tight. Corporate has asked us to make cuts. - Your termination will be effective in 30 days. - [Phil] I hold myself responsible for all of this. I had to make some tough decisions. - [Melanie] In this economy, we've had to right-size... Health-care coverage, job placement services. - [Phil] Every one of our papers across the country is eliminating- - Termination. - Jonah, I understand your concern. Anyone would feel the same thing in your situation. I'm glad you called, but I mean, why don't we give it a few weeks before we start panicking? - Well, it's not panicking. I think it's a smart move to try and reduce the payments to something a little bit more manageable. - We've got to know your income before we can set the terms, right? Focus on getting a job right now and talk to me first of the month. (soft music) - [Maggie] Do you know any other places hiring right now? - Well, not in newspapers, but there's bound to be something I can do. - [Maggie] And what if there's not? - It's gonna be okay. - Well, maybe I could pick up some serving shifts somewhere. - Yeah, I don't think we need to worry about that yet. - I don't know, Jonah. I really like it here, and I'd rather just fix this now than wait. I'm afraid it's gonna be too late. (soft music) I think maybe I should talk to my mom. - Out of the question. - It's either another job or my mom. I'm sorry, but I can't go back to some tiny apartment and then just wait for the stars to align so that we can start a family. It's either another job or my mom. (soft music) - [Ellen] I'd like to Laura and Cole to Disney at the end of the month, but I wanted to ask about staying with you before I offered Leah. - That sounds great, Mom, I'm just not sure how much time I'm gonna have to play host. - [Ellen] Well, if it's too much trouble, I'm sure your brother can afford to spring for a hotel. - That is not the issue, Mom. I just don't know how much time I'm gonna have to take off. - [Ellen] Has he gotten any offers? - [Maggie] He'll get something soon. - [Arnold] Mr. Price, I appreciate your interest. - [Peggy] And I sympathize with your circumstances, but- - [Nick] We're more focused on building our web presence right now. - Absolutely, you know, I've had tons of experience with the web and love training regarding the new programs. - [Bernard] We'd like someone with a more extensive magazine background. - [Daphne] Unfortunately, we aren't able to offer relocation expenses. - [Mark] Yes, I do remember. We were interested a year ago. - [Angela] You understand what it's like for an alt weekly. - [Trudy] We've had to fight to keep them from killing our print edition all together. - [Ellen] I just want you to be happy. If you'd stayed up here instead of following him all over the country, you might've had your own kids to take care of by now instead of everybody else's. Every one of the boys you dated in school had enough sense to find something stable that would support a family and will be around in 20 years. - [Maggie] Nothing in that place will change in 20 years. - [Cliff] Unfortunately, we're on a hiring freeze right now. - I understand that, sir. Just thought it might be worth a call. - [Meredith] We'll keep your information on file. - All right, well, thank you for your time. - [Woody] I'll be sure to give you a call if anything comes up. - If you're so worried, Mom, you could just write a check. - [Ellen] I'm sorry, Maggie, with your dad's health the way it is, we can't afford to look after anyone but ourselves right now. Besides, you're supposed to be an adult. What would it teach you to bail you out? - Business call? Oh, relax. I'd be doing the same thing. - [Jonah] Yeah, what's that? - Doing whatever I could to find a new job on company time and company dime. - Look, I've also been- - Look, you gotta cut corners. Don't worry, I'll back you up. - I appreciate that, Don. - The least I could do. - So what do we got? Anything good here? Melanie, dropped these in my box for you. - [Jonah] Oh. Tremendous. What's that? - That is something I'd like to keep quiet. - What do you got here, Don? Don't hold out on me. - Phil wanted to have some kind of a ceremony, even had my wife start to bake a cake but... I don't feel quite right about it. - [Jonah] 25 years, huh? How does it feel? - I don't know how to feel. I mean, I work harder and harder. I make less and less. And the suits keep making more and more. You know, there was a time they'd talk to me. They would consult with me before letting go the top layout artist I've worked with. - Well, you enjoy that. - Yeah. Listen, seriously, if there's something you need, if you gotta knock off early for an interview, come in late, whatever. If there's some way I can make your life a little easier, say the words. - [Ellen] It's not going to be easy. You're just going to have to tighten your belts. Stick to the necessities. - [Character on TV] You walking along, not a nickel in you jeans, you're free as the wind. Nobody bothers you. (phone beeping) Then you get ahold of some dough. And what happens? First thing you know, you own things. You're not the free and happy guy you used to be. You got to have money to pay for all those things. - [TV announcer] Tonight's jackpot is $35 million, and your winning lotto numbers are 47, 44, 42, 41, seven, and the last lotto number is 36. Now- - [Jonah] You wanna go to bed, babe? (soft music) - [Morty] Jonah, sorry for the wait. How's the job search coming? - Well, not so well. Not so well at all. You told me to give you a call if I hadn't had found anything by the first, so that is what I'm doing. - So what can I do you for? - [Jonah] Well, I figured if I had a longer term then I might be able to accept some offers right now. Bit too low to make the current payments. - Sounds like you got a good head on your shoulders there, Jonah. Let me pull up your file. Uh-oh. - [Jonah] What? - [Morty] Looks like we're no longer at liberty to change the terms. - [Jonah] What? - [Morty] We don't even actually own it anymore. - [Jonah] Whoa, Morty, who does? - [Morty] You should've gotten a notice about this. - [Jonah] I didn't get anything. (door creaking) (kids chattering) - Jonah. Jonah, will you please talk to me? What are you doing? - Buying time. - What do you mean? No way. - Look, I'll do it, okay? Just go back in the house. - No way. - Go back in the house. - No! - Look, this could go on for months. Do you realize how much money we would save here? - No. It's gotta be dangerous. You trying to get yourself killed? - No, I'm not gonna get myself killed. It's not dangerous. - I suppose you do know what you're doing, huh? - Before I was old enough for a paper route, this is what we did when Mom's hours got cut back. - Jonah. Come on, we'll find another way. - Yeah, fine. (door slamming) (crickets chirping) (knocking on door) - Just forget it. - [Boothe] And you are? - [Jonah] Jonah Price. - Okay, let's see. And what interests you about Eagle Staffing Agency? - As you can see on my resume, I've worked in extremely professional, competitive environments for nearly 10 years. I have excellent computer skills, and given my background in publishing, I think I'd have an edge when it comes to communication within a corporate environment. - I see. It doesn't look like you have any experience as an executive assistant, or a secretary, even a receptionist, for that matter. - Well, no, but I've worked in newspapers all around the country for nearly 10 years, and like all my references are gonna tell you, I have zero problems adapting to new challenges. - You never scheduled appointments? - No, but I've- - Maintained a company filing system? - Well, I've had to adhere to a common filing system. - Yeah, but solely for an individual? Like an executive, for instance. - No. - Have you ever had any office management responsibilities, such as maintaining an inventory of office supplies before? - No. - What about office machines? Fax, copier? - I can operate a fax machine and make copies. - I see. How about heavy phones? Have you ever had to handle multi-line heavy phone traffic before? - Yeah, I can answer the phone. - Make coffee? - I've had to redesign entire sections of the paper at the last minute so an ad rep can satisfy his clients. I've dealt with constant deadline pressure, day in and day out. I have done three people's jobs for weeks at a time, so I think these are, you know, the filing, the heavy phones, these are things that I could handle. - I understand you possess some notable qualifications that many of our candidates for placement don't, but we need to fully stand behind the employees that we place. I'm not saying that you won't be considered, I just, you know, if your background check and drug screening come back clean, then we'll see. I believe we have your contact information, so you know, if we have a match, I'll be in touch. (knocking on window) - Hey. - That bad, huh? - Let's just say I'm not holding my breath. - [Maggie] I'm sorry. - [Jonah] Me too. - [Maggie] I mean, for everything. - [Jonah] Me too. - You're gonna find something. - What am I gonna find that pays enough to keep the house, Maggie? I'm sorry. - Why don't you go camping this weekend, Jonah? I just, I think it would be good for you to get away and clear your head, regroup. I think it'll be good for both of us. (soft music) (line trilling) - [Jonah] Hey, it's Jonah, leave me a message. (phone beeping) (waves lapping) (birds chirping) (microwave beeping) - Hey babe, it's me. Just checking to see where you are. Call me back, okay? I love you. (soft music) - [TV announcer] Free of charge with absolutely no obligation for just 14.95, but this spectacular- - [Sterling] What those companies hope you'll do. At the Ster... (line trilling) - [Jonah] Hey, it's Jonah, leave me a message. (phone beeping) - I don't know what's goin' on here, but can you just please call me and let me know you're okay? - [Jonah] Hey, it's Jonah, leave me a message. (phone beeping) - Jonah, pick up! Where are you? Look, I know things have been hard lately. Maybe that's my fault. I don't know, just... I love you, I'm worried about you. Please just call me back. - [Jonah] Hey, it's Jonah, leave me a message. (phone beeping) - Jonah, where are you? I don't know what to do. Do I call 911? Could you please just come home? Now? I love you. (crickets chirping) (phone ringing) Hello? - I didn't think I'd get you. I was gonna leave a voicemail. We're coming down at the end of the month. - Okay. - [Ellen] Now don't worry, we're staying at a hotel. I'll make sure you don't have to worry about anything. - You haven't bought your plane tickets yet, have you? - [Ellen] Why? - I haven't heard from him since Friday night. - [Ellen] All weekend? - [Maggie] It's not like that. - [Ellen] Are you sure? You don't always know. - Well, he went camping, but he didn't come back when he said he would, and I couldn't get through on his cell. - [Ellen] Could there be someone else? (line trilling) - This might be weird, but I need to ask you something. - Go ahead. - If Jonah was seeing anybody, I just, maybe you don't know. I just feel like a lot of times I've heard that that happens a lot. If I don't hear from him tonight, I think I'm gonna go to the police. But when I do, I just don't wanna be some poor woman whose husband ran off and she didn't see it coming. - Look, if something was going on here, you know, he would've been pretty sly about it. I mean, he could have, but I really don't think that's the case. - [Maggie] I'd say that's a relief, but the alternatives aren't relieving at all, so thanks, I guess. - I understand. (soft music) - [Ellen] You heard from his mother? - [Maggie] She's not staying with us. - But- - No, she's just gonna stay with a friend who used to go to their church or something. - That's ridiculous. I mean, you're right here. She shouldn't have to- - [Maggie] She doesn't like us. Well, she doesn't like me, you know, kinda like how you are with Jonah. (police radio chattering) - Cell phone and car keys were both found inside the tent, as well as some camping gear: stove, headlamp, cookware, sleeping bag, water bottles, clothes. Once we finish the necessary forensic work, you can inspect the contents of the tent and tell us if there's anything missing. A ranger found his car up near the boat launch. Wallet was found inside the console, looks untouched. (police radio chattering) - [Detective] At the moment, our most likely scenario is that Mr. Price went exploring where the river meets the ocean. Maybe he encountered some trouble- - Do you think he's out there? - [Detective] We're gonna get as many people out here searching for him as we can for the next 36 hours. We need to take other scenarios into- - What are you saying? - [Detective] This place has some powerful rip currents. Solo swimmer, we don't know if he had a life jacket on. - Now who knows if they're right? You're gonna keep looking, isn't that right? - Yes, ma'am. (waves crashing) (soft music) - Hey, we're home, sweetheart. Come on, honey, just get a little rest. I promise you'll feel better with just a little rest after a long day. Sit down. I'll get your shoes. - [Maggie] Thanks, Mom. - That's what moms are for, so I'm told. Left foot right up here. Pop up your sweet feet. I can't give you another one for a few hours, so I sure hope you can sleep, okay? - [Maggie] I love you, Mom. - I love you, too. You are my precious girl. Sleep. (soft music) Primary beneficiary, Maggie Price, spouse. Beneficiary to be paid $500,000. Hi, dear. Question for the lawyer in the family. - Mom, what if by some miracle he's out there, who knows where, but I'm not waiting for him? - [Ellen] I don't think they would've called off the search if they thought there was a chance they could save him. - I know, but it's just- - What? - There's still a chance. - Listen, Maggie, I don't pretend for a second to know where he is, but it is not here. And I think it is worth your while to see if you can get something for your trouble. - That makes me feel like a horrible person. - I have to deal with horrible people in this line of business sometimes. I mean, these are people that are out for money, right? They don't care how they're gonna go about getting it. You do not strike me as one of those. Not even close. But I also deal with people that have a good case, but they're either ignorant or just plain stubborn. They come to me too late for me to do anything about it. All right, so that's why it's important that we take the initiative in these matters. It's gonna go a long way to preventing an even bigger mess later that's gonna be a lot harder to clean up. - I think I need to sleep on it. I hope that's not a problem. - No, Maggie, not at all. I understand. Just remember, for the best chance of a favorable settlement, we need to get on this right away. Just give me the word, all right, and we're gonna put this into action. - Thank you for your time. - Absolutely. Thanks for coming in. - I don't know what you're waiting for. I think he would take good care of you. Even if he's out there, you should still do it. Honestly, if I thought he were, I'd be even more convinced. Because in that case, where is he? Why did he leave you to deal with all of this on your own? (soft music) I wish you the best with this. You know I love you. - [Maggie] Thank you. Have a safe trip, Mom. (soft music) (crickets chirping) (soft music continues) (patrons chattering) - [Man on TV] Tonight, all across this state and all across this country, there are people working hard to ensure that their children would have a better opportunity in this life than they have had themselves. And they are blessed to live in this great and extraordinary society where indeed that dream is still possible, and is still true. (dog barking) (paper shuffling) - [Maggie] Who did this? - You didn't know about it? - Of course not. - Maggie, I am so sorry, she said that- - Who? - Mrs. Price, I mean his mother. She said that, she told me that- - I should've known. - I thought that you knew everything. - I'm sorry, Don. I didn't mean to come in here and just start... - I just thought that... (soft music) (Maggie crying) - How's this work? - Well, there's a remote possibility that if someone were to petition for a probate hearing, your in-laws for example, that you might lose something, but all of his assets should be transferred to you. Precedent for cases like these, you know, with a surviving spouse is pretty airtight, even without a will. - [Maggie] What about- - No, ma'am, not yet. Look, we're not like a lot of the other firms out there who are gonna bill you by the hour and hope to get rich off of wasting your time, all right? We take our share from the back end, because we do plan on winning. We're very good at what we do, and you will not owe us anything that our performance doesn't warrant. (light music) - [Ellen] You're down there all by yourself. If you've got to start over, you might as well do it up here. - I need to get everything settled down here before I can even think about that. - [Ellen] How long is that going to take? - Without a body, the courts generally take five years to issue a death certificate so the insurance company can be sure that the person in question is actually dead. - All those people couldn't find him. - Look, the state can expedite the death certificate, all right, as long as we can prove that your husband was exposed to imminent peril. But since this isn't a major disaster, you know, legally speaking, it still could take up to a year. - I'll be out of my house. - I'll do what I can, all right, to move this thing along, but if I were you, I would do everything in your power to get out from under that house. - We were supposed to have kids in that house. - The market hasn't changed too much, but at the same time I see that you guys still have some work to do here. The lawn should be mowed, and it would help if you would get rid of the weeds. You wanna make sure that the house looks like it's been kept up and you've taken good care of it. (children laughing) (engine rumbling) - Ms. Price. - [Sterling] Hey, Maggie. Have a seat, this shouldn't take long. - [Maggie] So what's this about? - Miss Price, we've been asked to take another look at your husband's, his... - Death? - That's right. - You know how things are when there's insurance money at stake. - Now if I recall correctly, your husband lost his job shortly before he disappeared? - [Maggie] Yes, that's right. - And he was having some trouble finding work? Would you say he was depressed? I'm sorry, Miss Price, but I'm gonna need you to speak up- - Yes, he was depressed. - He wouldn't have done it on purpose or anything, would he? - Okay, Maggie, let me restate that. If Jonah committed suicide, then the insurance company would only have to refund the premiums versus the full benefits. - He would've said goodbye. There wasn't even a note, so... - Forgive me, Miss Price, but I had to ask. - Is that all, sir? - Ma'am, I'm afraid that there's one more thing. And again, I apologize if it is insensitive. - [Maggie] Go ahead. - Is there any possibility that your husband could be trying to defraud the insurance company for his benefit or yours? - We're done, okay? Maggie, you don't have to answer that at all, okay? - No. - No chance? - None. My husband couldn't pull off something like that. I mean, I love him, but he wouldn't have... Just something that he wouldn't do, okay? - Well, I'm sorry to have bothered you. Miss Price, I think I've heard all that I needed to hear. - Glad to hear it. - Goodbye, ma'am. - Goodbye. - I am impressed. - What? What do you mean? I told the truth. - Doesn't matter you're telling the truth. Only matters whether you're convincing. - I think that's the most cynical thing I've ever heard. - Yeah well, any cop or lawyer will tell you the same thing. A good one, anyway. - I suppose I ought to feel good about today then. - Well, step in the right direction. You know, they still may come back and try to only pay half. They're entitled to without the body. I mean, hey, it's better than the alternative. - Half is more than enough. - You gettin' by? - I'll be okay. - You sure? I mean, if anything changes, you know, if you need anything, you can call me, day or night. I'm sure we can work out a mutually beneficial arrangement. Just keep it in mind. - I'm gonna go. (light music) (microwave beeping) (water running) - Maggie. - Oh my God. - Maggie, it's me. (knocking on door) Maggie, come on, open up. (thunder rumbling) Maggie. Maggie, come on, open the door. - Oh my God. - I came back to you as soon as I could. - What? - What's wrong? - You son of a bitch. - Maggie, look, I would've told you if- - You should have. - [Jonah] Maggie, it's not like I didn't trust you. - The second that you thought about this, you should've told me. I thought I lost you. - It wouldn't have worked if I told you. - Oh my God! I don't think I even know you. - Maggie, don't you get it? I did this for us. - Which part, Jonah? - All of it. - Don't touch me! - I did all of this for us, Maggie. Yeah. - The part where I thought you were dead? Like the part where you ran off and left me here by myself to clean up your mess? That was for us. - Maggie, everything I did was for you. - Don't you stand there and tell me that this was for us. You did what was easiest for you. I can't even look at you, Jonah. I can't believe- - You think this was easy for me? Do you have any idea the things I have been through? - I want you to leave. - No, no, no, no, no. Look. You're all that matters. I don't care about anything but you. - If you cared about me, you would've never done this to me. I can't even look at you, I can't... - You don't get it, do you? - There is nothing that you could say that could possibly excuse this. - Excuse this? Maggie, excuse this? What do you mean, excuse this? - I want you to leave. - Is that what you want, you want me to leave? - I don't want you to be here. - All right. I love you, and I'm really glad to see you. (Maggie crying) (thunder rumbling) (rain drizzling) - If you're not out of here by the time I wake up tomorrow, I'm turning you in. Either you leave or I'm calling the cops. - You are the only one who knows I'm alive, okay? The only thing standing between us and a half million dollars is some paperwork, Maggie. - It's a quarter million. And it's going to be- - So? - [Maggie] At least a year. - Do you have any idea how long we could make that last someplace else? - Give it up, Jonah. It's over! - Are you serious right now? You would send me to prison? - Don't tempt me. I just don't want you here. - You'd really send me to prison right now, wouldn't you? - I just don't want you here. - Where do you want me to go, Maggie? - You've been somewhere else this whole time, Jonah. Just go there. (woman moaning) (fly buzzing) (TV chattering) (line trilling) - [Phone Recording] The wireless customer you have called is not available at this time. Please try your call again later. (phone beeping) (soft music) (grease crackling) (dishes clattering) (soft music continues) (doorbell ringing) - I'm really glad you could make it. - Yeah, me too. - Come on. This is gonna have to be a little bit quicker than I was hoping, 'cause I have to get back to work to do a couple things. It's okay. (chuckles) But why don't we first give you a tour? (soft music) And this is the bedroom. Look. I'm sorry. I think I'm so much usually better at this type of thing. I just, by the look that you're giving me right now, I don't think you understand what's happening. It's my fault, 'cause I really should've been much clearer. Yeah, I know you need the money, so I'm gonna go ahead and leave this on the dresser. Everything okay? Look, cleaning supplies, right? The cleaning supplies are downstairs. They're in the closet right next to the laundry room. Okay, 'cause you'll need those. And it's better this way. Okay, 'cause you need the money, right, and then my wife comes home to a clean house and I don't have to sleep on the couch. Take all the time you need. Okay, you have all day. Diane, my wife, doesn't get home till four so, call me if you need anything. (soft music) (vacuum humming) (soft music continues) (cleaning tool thudding) (hand pounding) (Maggie sniffling) (carwash beeps) (tool clanging) (metal rattling) (soft music) - Maggie? Hey, Maggie. Maggie? (door creaking) - [Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency? - [Jonah] My wife's been electrocuted. - [Dispatcher] I'm sorry, sir, what's your emergency? - My wife has been electrocuted. - [Dispatcher] And the exact location of your emergency? - 2121 Sabal Palm Circle, 32820. - [Dispatcher] I'll have the paramedics on the way right away. Now sir, what's your name? Sir? (Jonah breathing heavily) (soft tense music) (tire squealing) (soft tense music continues) (soft music)
