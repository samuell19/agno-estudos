Somewhere in the Middle East 3 years later, the Northern Japan Alps Intruder, mark 0448 hours Heading southeast Single object, speed 350 Altitude 25... 24... 23... Send in Flight 01. Vector 030. Climb to 20000 feet. Contact Sound Phone, channel 2. Altitude 15, descending taster Negative contact. The stealth may have crashed. Roger. Mission complete. RTB. Come again? Return to Komatsu base. Roger. Near the Prime Ministers Residence. Tokyo Prime Minister, we have an emergency. Toyo Newspaper. Matsumoto Bureau. Nagano Prefecture Toyo Newspaper. Matsumoto Bureau. Senpai? It's Ochiai. A training flight? Yeah. Some climbers called, and we checked with the police. A Self-Defense Force plane had engine trouble, but they're OK. That was later. What do you mean? Never mind. Bye. Senpai? The Ministry? Here. Hello. I'd have sent this, you know. No. I thought we should meet in person one last time. Don't worry. I'll take good care of Yu. Goodbye. Would you give him these? More mountains? Yeah. Always the same... ...ever since my sister died. Bye. Hotaka Station Do you know the time? We're heading out. Get your stuff. Get your camera. We've got work to do. Work? Yep. I'm hiring you. What do you mean? Is this it? Mitakesawa is here. We can't approach by helicopter in this weather... so we'll go up on foot. The Narashino Airborne and Matsumoto Ranger Combined Unit... will proceed in two squads. Squad I will go from Shikanosawa along Hachino Ridge to Mt Fumon... to Shimodaira. Squad 2 will cross Mt Shiroya at Motone Pass... and from there to Shimodaira. One moment. Why two squads? In case special agents have infiltrated the mountains. Continue. Yes, sir. Even with the Rangers, we anticipate getting there will take... two and a half days. Chief... Would a short break in the blizzard allow the helicopters to fly? They are presently standing by... at the Eastern Air Corps base at Tachikawa. Just be very careful that no word of this leaks out. Look. The towns crawling with cops. And yesterday they sent in two F-15s from Komatsu. The two that came later. So you saw them? They were after... this. Can your paper analyze those? Not coming from me, I've been suspended. And Keiko works at a photo-wag. That's the logical place. We're lucky your sister-in-law works there. No luck this way, either. I guess the only way in is by Takizawa. Do we have to do this? This blizzard's going to last tor a week. Should I go alone? Come on. How were the pictures? Same as always. Your milk. Don't forget it. This is Arisawa. Sorry? OK. I'm on my way. Sorry, Yu. I have to go. I've made some stew tor supper. Heat that up with some rice. And... keep the door locked. Don't let anyone in. OK? OK. See you later. It's a tough climb, but it'll save us three hours. What? Defense Force... We're going back. They're prepared for battle. Hey Two nights ago, two unknown Asians snuck onto the U.S. base at Yokota. What? No ones said what happened, but one was shot and killed. And one escaped. Your picture... F-15s sent in... Those soldiers... They're probably all connected. Hi. Aoki. Weren't you working on the hot-spring story? Not now. Too bad. Wise Magazine, Editorial Offices, Tokyo Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Stop there. Bingo. Schwarzkopf. Pentagon. East Asia Desk. Isn't he in Beijing at the 6-Nation Talks? Must've been in a huge hurry. The U.S. Ambassador's gone home, and the Prime Minister's busy all day. So the incident at Yokota wasn't just a random break-in. Arisawa... Yes? Why me? What, you'd rather be in Kusatsu at the hot springs? A clinic? Where did... I have my ways. Give me something rough by deadline. We might even run it as a feature. Come on. Aoki. Sorry about the hot springs. It would have been good tor the skin. Don't mention it. Well. I get a lot of different patients in here. That's a bit too much. I'm supposed to get some morphine to him later. Morphine? Pain-killer. But he won't last much longer. It's your medicine. Morphine... you need a hit, don't you. Wait It's OK We're journalists. We just want to know what's going on. She doesn't understand Japanese. If this is the guy who broke into Yokota, it's a scoop. Let's get him to hospital. Hos-pi-tal. It's OK. It's all right. Trust us. You can't stay here. The Self-Defense Force were here... heading northwest. And here's where you saw the light come down. It wasn't just a plane crash. Get out You OK? Why did they do that? They aren't Japanese military. What? That wasn't Japanese. This is a Public Security Bureau list of special agents active in Japan. This is the man who was killed at Yokota. It these agents have infiltrated the mountains then what is it that... they want? This is JP0TOH. JP0TOH, does anyone read me? Over. This is JP0TOH, JP0TOH, does anyone read me? Over. We're going back. Something weird's going on here. What are you talking about? I'm going on. Don't be stupid. We're lucky we didn't get killed. You got me into journalism. This could be the scoop of a lifetime. What happened to you? Why are you being like this? What happened over there? You came back and vanished into the mountains... while Shizuko died. Have you quit taking pictures? Of course not So come on Senpai I quit putting myself in danger. Hey, I hired you. The pay's not worth it. How much? A billion. Sure OK. I get it. I'll go get lost and die alone. Happy? Be my guest. I will See you. So you frequent seedy motels? They'll be safe here. Inject him every three hours. You have to wait three hours. Understand? Sorry It's all right It's all right. I'll stay. You take this back. Murderer. Hello. Yu? I'm sorry I'm not back. Are you OK? Yeah. The bread's on the micro-wave. I'm making toast now. Have some milk. I know. I'll be fine. I promise I'll be home today. 'Bye now. OK. Bye-bye. You know why my sister never told you she was sick? She loved your photographs. And the man who found moments of tranquility in a war zone. She was proud you were working for peace. She was waiting for you to go back to being Yuji Nishizaki, the war photographer. She hid her illness from you, just waiting. You took off into the mountains, and didn't realize a thing. Not her state of mind, or her physical condition. I'll take Yu, and raise him in Tokyo. If he's a special agent... where are his people? What's he running from? Ms Arisawa Special delivery. Shinichiro Ochiai Squad 1 is on a ridge near Mt Fumon, heading to the location. Squad 2 is camped due to strong winds, and will take a different route... via Abumizawa to Shimodaira. That is all. And the Americans? Their Alpine Special Forces Squad won't reach Yokota for five days. Five days? So as it works out... we're on our own. Everyone, the incident occurred here. That means we are the ones... who must handle it. As it works out. Ochiai You idiot Just as I was wondering what Nishizaki was up to, we get these. Soft-focus, too He says if came down here. Ah. Mitakesawa... You've been there? No. A Toyo Shinbun reporter named Ochiai sent them. They're both going up there. Ochiai? Yeah, he made a speech at Nishizaki's wedding. A high-school friend. A year younger. In the Alpine Club. He said his senpai had inspired him to be a reporter. But why send this to us? Toyo's a big paper. He punched his boss over a story and got transferred to Matsumoto. Yeah yeah yeah... So he can't ask his head office. Here... That's a plane... So we'll get a specialist to look at it. You should get some sleep. Your skin... Sorry. You've given up. I hope? Let's go home. I turned and ran, you know. There was pressure from upstairs to kill a story. I punched my boss. I knew that would end my career. I couldn't stop myself. What I was doing was running away from myself. Some journalist And now I'm running again. But hey, that's me. Eat. Up higher, the radio might work. Arisawa. Keiko. Keiko. Keiko? Yes. Me Keiko. You? Chihe. Chihe? When did you come here? Yes? OK, we'll come back. It's the editor. They found out what's in the photo. Really? K-E-I-K-O. Keep it. Call it there's trouble. Whatever happens, stay here. OK? This is JP0TOH. JP0TOH. Does anyone read me? Over. No, huh? This is JS0DQM. This is JS0DQM. I have a message You're breaking up... This is Yuji Nishizaki. I'm on Iwakiri Ridge, six kilometers southeast of Mitakesawa. On February 2nd at 4:50 a.m. I saw a fireball near Mitakesawa. I think a plane crashed. Hiking in, we came under fire from an armed group. We're under fire Call Keiko Arisawa in Tokyo She lives... in Koto Ward, at Ohashi 2-5-1... unit 1204 Her phone... Tell her to run the photo Run the photo It's an American B-5 bomber. A stealth bomber? So radar won't... They'll show up on radar it they're damaged. And two Japanese F-15s were sent in at exactly the same time. No wonder the Pentagon's upset. That's huge... Chief Layouts ready. You check it. The question is, what did it have on board? This could affect all East Asia. So what was on board? We have the key to that mystery in our hands, don't we? That guy... Is he still out cold? Yes. And the girl hasn't told us anything. The morning after Yokota, two men were found near Fussa, shot dead. Both foreigners, both under Public Security Bureau observation. Chief... how do you know... Well. I have my ways. You scratch my back. I scratch... - The police... - What? This is where you come in. Deadline's not tor a while yet. Got anything? He had this... Whoa Give it back All right. Wipe the fingerprints. The gun, stupid Down The guys who shot at us... The Defense Force They're in danger It's a trap Look out Run Ochiai Get down You OK? Are you? Down Are you OK? What's going on here? Yuji Nishizaki? I ask you to leave the area. You were listening in... I want you both out of here. What will you do? My job. Let me see. I'm fine. Like hell you are. Let's get out of sight. I haven't thanked you. It you hadn't shouted, we'd have all been wiped out. When the weather clears, I'd like you to go down the mountain. That again? Tell us why you're here. Then we might consider it. That's a state secret. How convenient. You can cover up anything you want. What's your name, or is that secret, too? Akihiko Saeki. A Major... It the Narashino Airborne is here, it must be important. The elite strike force? Major Saeki, with that wound, you'll just die in the snow. I'm trained tor this. Thanks tor your help. Don't disrespect the mountain. You didn't train in blizzards. We've been winter-climbing in the Northern Alps tor 20 years. They're our back yard. We're offering to help. You have to get to Mitakesawa. Fine. Not fine. Thank you. I first saw Mr Nishizaki's work when I was in high school. Kosovo. Bosnia... the war photos. The next day I got a part-time job, then bought a camera. He's gone. The man who took those pictures died a long time ago. Good night. Thanks. Uh... are you Ms Keiko Arisawa? Do you know a Yuji Nishizaki? Sorry? Come in. Good boy You didn't open the door, near Mitakesawa, plane crashed. Hiking in, we came under fire from an armed group. We're under fire Call Keiko Arisawa in Tokyo She lives in Koto Ward, at Ohashi 2-5-1 unit 1204 Tell her to run the photo Run the photo Ochiai? That's all. Civilians? Tell her to run the photo Run the photo This is a real war The U.S. talks tough internationally, and now they want to cooperate. After all, it's just a plane crash. It's not like it landed in the peninsula. So what was on board? That's what I said. We need the link between the Yokota break-in and the Midnight Eagle. Anyway, those two are going to be in real danger. Not two. Three. I'll talk to the Security Bureau. Wait Let me talk to those two first. I'll explain. They'll think we lied. Squad 1 reporting. We are 200 meters northeast of Shimodaira. ETA is 16:10 hours. Roger that. Alpha 1, are you there? Alpha 1, come in Any further contact from Squad 1? They left first. There's been no word... since their message at 11:30. Sir Agents are confirmed en route to the target area. Issue an evacuation order. On what grounds? What do we say to have the public should leave? Reveal what was on that plane, and the whole country will panic. What's more, our whole foreign policy goes up in smoke We have to prepare for a worst-case scenario. Come on There's a GPS transmitter in Chihe's cell phone. Oh. They're heading for the harbor. Watch the dot. Right. There. Let's go. Uh-oh... Hurry It's all right I'm done for. Leave me and go. I was supposed to go home after this last job. Job? To put a bomb on the stealth bomber at Yokota base and make it crash. Why? A bomber with a weapon flies over our homeland. So we crashed it. Then why couldn't you go home? I met Chihe. Shed fled here. I wanted to live here with her and the child she's going to have. I killed my commander. I needed insurance... for a deal. Insurance? What? It will save... Chihe, the baby... and your country. So... what's up there? A B-5 stealth bomber. Code name Midnight Eagle. Stealth? American? Out of the U.S. base at Yokota... Foreign agents put a bomb in it. To make it crash... Why? Why? A nuke. I knew it Nuclear-armed bombers are flying out of Yokota What? The U.S. Air Force is said to be flying armed aircraft above the peninsula. That's the story I had that got killed. Is this true? That's not my jurisdiction. You're all the same So... there are agents here, too? They might try to set off what was aboard that plane. Set oft? Over a 10-kilometer radius, the bomb will create 10 million degrees of heat... and several hundred thousand atmospheres in blast pressure. The snow-cap will melt instantly and pour into the Azusa River. And it will flood an area of 70000 civilian households. Radiation from the blast will spread in all directions. The seasonal winds will bring it over Tokyo, then all eastern Japan, and possibly, in time, over the entire country. There's no way I'll let that happen. As you can imagine... Tokyo and the Pacific Coast will be showered with radiation. Tokyo... Millions will die. Senpai Come on. Leave me. Take her. Yokota 2nd Lieutenant Yokota. He served under me tor three years. Can this be happening in Japan? I've seen war all over the world. I'm sick of it. Over and over... Fireballs of napalm licking their way over the ground... killing soldiers, children, anyone and everyone. All because of armies. Kids wanting to live, their future gone in a flash. That's war. In this country we shouldn't have wars, or armies. I'm in a hurry. And... we're not an army. We're the Self-Defense Force. We've found out who that photographer was trying to reach. His sister-in-law, a journalist. She may have been in contact with the foreign agent. Good shot. What are they doing here? Probably standing guard. Guard? On what? Captain Takada... The best of the Rangers. Hurt that bad... he still made it here. The crew fled? They're probably dead. Sorry. Wait here. Good. You're doing fine. I'm back. Aoki? What's... Get out of there Yu Hurry This way Stay back Stay back Haven't you given that thing back yet? You should see your face Sasaki. Public Security. Oh, relax. I have my ways. Aoki took the girl to hospital. Don't be so tense. It's bad tor the skin. The bomb's activated. It'll go off at midnight. In two and a half hours. Is this why they crashed it? The password's changed. You can't stop it? Get out of here. Now How far would we get... in two hours? But... This isn't tor you. This is JP0TOH, JP0TOH, does anyone read me? This is JP0TOH, JP0TOH, does anyone read me? Nothing. And the battery's going. Can you hear me? Answer me Hey Mr Nishizaki... Mr Nishizaki... Mr Nishizaki... Yes. I read you. Go on. I found Ms Arisawa. Keiko... Keiko? OK, listen, we're at Mitakesawa. There's only two and a half hours 'till the bomb goes off. In two and a half hours, what? The password's been changed We need the password Uh. Mr Nishizaki... The password for the explosive device? This is... We still read you... This is Major Saeki That's probably the Matsumoto Field Unit. Crap The battery Come in. Ms Keiko Arisawa? I am Watarase. Prime Minister. How do you do. I apologize for the inconvenience. Mr Nishizaki's son? This is Yu. As I'm sure you're aware. Mr Nishizaki is now... in the Northern Alps. The stealth plane. Yes, at the stealth plane. A special explosive device aboard that aircraft is activated. Explosive device? We must be prepared tor the worst. We need a password. Did Toshio Hirata, the agent you were with, tell you anything? Here. Thank you Go Ms Arisawa, thank you. And I have a very unfair request. And that is? I ask you not to reveal what you have learned or what you will learn of this matter. It's our job to reveal the truth. The truth does not always lead to the nation's security and well-being. This truth would not only cause turmoil in Japan. It would present great danger to the stability of all East Asia. Please understand. This nation, and its preservation... is our job. Is that why you stood by and let the Americans get us into this? I'm afraid there were a few things of which we were not informed. Contact with Major Saeki Sir. I'll connect you. Mr Saeki, this is Prime Minister Watarase. Saeki reporting. I arrived at 21:16 hours and am aboard the aircraft. However. I believe all other members of the combined unit have been lost. Have you been hurt? There is no need tor concern. I see. However, the bomb's been activated. We're breaking the code that should deactivate it. Bear with us, please. I will report at 23:50 hours, ten minutes before... the bomb is to explode. Mr Saeki, are Mr Nishizaki and Mr Ochiai there? Nishizaki speaking. This is Prime Minister Watarase. I sincerely regret that a civilian such as yourself... has been caught up in this. On behalf of the government. I humbly apologize. Not at all. Ochiai and I are here of our own volition. There is someone here who would like to speak with you. One moment, please. Switching to conference. Speak from there. It's Keiko. Are you all right? Yeah. I'm fine. I got your message. We got a chip from an agent who planted the bomb. A chip? It should tell us the password. Yeah? Make it back. Yu's waiting tor you. Sorry, the battery's dying. Over and out. Nope. It's gone. It's probably back in the dugout. Who uses cans in this day and age? And peaches, too. I just grabbed the wrong can. Without an opener, who cares? Do it right You're still a klutz. Beef or fish? Why didn't you tell us you had these? This is Midnight Eagle. I'm sorry, Mr Saeki, we haven't... Sir The password has been deciphered Major Saeki. I'll read it. T for Tango. E for Echo. I for India. G for Golf. That is all. Deactivated. Good thing your sister-in-law's got brains. She's only ever made one big mistake. Introducing me to her sister. What? Something moved. Wait Major Saeki... as soon as the weather clears, we'll send the helicopters in. Sir... I have something else to report. It appears that the enemy has us surrounded. I believe they've returned to reactivate the bomb. This is Fuyuki. Press Secretary. The U.S. tells us there's a CCD camera on board. Could you find the switch? Is that it? It's on: That's Papa. My estimate is that there are... about 30 soldiers. Since we didn't know how many agents were in the mountains... we should have foreseen this. Mr. No, Major Saeki Until reinforcements arrive... I ask you to do all you can to guard that bomb. Yes, sir. I will defend the Midnight Eagle with my life. Do that. Fuyuki... Issue an evacuation order tor the relevant area. Yes, sir. Are they really going to try and reset the bomb? There's no way we can let them get their hands on it. There's only three of us... What an honor. We three are the chosen ones. Even the World Cup team chooses 23. Four of them. No, six. Two by that rock. Hold your fire. They don't know we can see them. Let them get close. Ready? Fire when I do. And keep shooting. Now they know we've got goggles. They'll consider the next attack. They'll wait tor a while. Hey... This isn't fair A rocket-propelled grenade launcher. They need to see to use it. They'll wait till dawn... then rush us. Let em come. The wind has changed direction. The blizzard will let up briefly. Send the helicopters Can I ask you something? Why did you enlist? I was in my 3rd year at the Defense Academy... before something convinced me I'd made the right choice. Yuji Nishizaki's photographs. I didn't want what I saw there to happen to anyone else. I made up my mind then to join the Defense Forces. That's ironic. I was cursing war as I took them, and I was inspiring you. Why? Why did you stop publishing three years ago? Taking photos... never saved a single life. I knew if from the start. Then one day the truth of it smacked me in the face and knocked me over. Just one picture... made me take pride in my work. The man who took those pictures ignored his wife, and took away... the most precious thing his son had. Choppers. Impossible. OK? Yeah, we'll manage. Eagle here. Go back. You'll crash in this weather. Pull out. Hang on We'll save you Go back. I said Go back Shut up and wait. Saeki, it's me. Saito. You read me? Saito...? Are you crazy? Hell. I haven't seen you since your wedding. Just get out of here Unit 2, losing altitude Can you make it? I'll go down. Saeki, wer'e coming down. We'll take care of them all. Idiot. You'll never make it Go home Hey... Look Rocket bomb Shoot them We can't see to shoot back Down Get back When you were dead drunk I'd drag you back to the dorm I don't remember that. Shut up and wait Please I don't want to see any more of my friends get killed We can't see Saeki... Go back Saito... please. This is Unit 2. We've been hit Saeki. I'm sorry. Thanks for coming. Pull out. All units... retreat One, two... Three... Four, five... Ten of them to each of us? Well, we'll figure something out. This is Nishizaki... Papa Yu I have a request. I'm afraid... we can't hold out long here. There are more than 30 of them, and they have a rocket launcher. Major Saeki thinks the same. Since we're civilians... he's kept quiet. What is it? Drop napalm on us. Napalm? That is... the only course left to us. That is the wish of Yuji Nishizaki Major Saeki and Shinichiro Ochiai of the Toyo Shinbun. All three of us. Napalm... General. It's an incendiary, used to burn away jungle cover during the Vietnam War. An 800-pound canister... will suffocate any living thing within a one by two-kilometer area. And inside the Eagle? And wouldn't it set off the bomb the Eagle is carrying? No. Napalm burns up instantaneously. The bomb can stand ten hours at 900 degrees. It won't explode. Wait. The UN Human Rights Convention outlawed napalm in 1996. We don't have anything like that, either. There's a U.S. Los Angeles-class submarine in the Japan Sea. The U.S.S. St Virginia. Its Tomahawk missiles can be fitted with a warhead... having the same effect as napalm. Ochiai Ochiai Take this and go. You can get two kilometers away and be all right. What? Shut up and go You're a journalist. Ochiai Hey Senpai... Sorry. I got you into this. Idiot. If you hadn't spoken up, there'd be millions of people dead. Yeah? I didn't run away this time. The mountains are better in the summer, aren't they. Yeah. You're right. When the snow melts, let's come again. Ochiai? Ochiai? Ochiai? Prime Minister... Shinichiro Ochiai has just died. Please... don't waste our lives. I don't care about the country... but as a father. I ask you to let me save my son's lite. Please The U.S. Navy reports the Tomahawk is ready A politicians greatest responsibility... is to prevent war, whatever that may take. My boy... never forget this face. Never. I'm the old man who's to blame tor this. Launch the Tomahawk. Missile launched. It will reach Mitakesawa in about ten minutes. We need ten minutes. You'll have a better chance. You're married... Yeah. Kids? Next month. A girl. Yeah? See you on the other side. Yeah. With Ochiai. Smile. You look good. Is Keiko Arisawa there? I'm here. I'm sorry. I can't come for Yu. Papa Yu... Papa... Hi. How're you doing? Not bad. And school? It hasn't started yet today. Oh. Make sure you be nice and get along with Keiko. OK? OK. Papa... Thanks for the star pictures. Yeah. Don't lose them. Papa, when will I see you next? Always be with you. Keiko... Yes? Take care of Yu. I'll make my apologies to your sister. Keiko... Will you forgive me? No. I won't forgive you. Papa... Did you drink your milk? Yep Got your thermos? Yep It's not too heavy? I'm tine. Let's not miss our train, then. All right? In memory of Yuji Nishizaki, lost in the Northern Japan Alps Chihe...
