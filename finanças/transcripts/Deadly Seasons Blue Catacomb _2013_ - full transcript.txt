To our first meeting. Lord, give me strength, cast a favorable eye over my hands' work so I can complete what I did with your help. Dear Lord, give me strength. BLUE CATACOMBS Delete contact? Deleted Rousseau - Missed Call Oh, no. Shit! Thank you. Hi. CATACOMBS ENTRANCE Hello, Commander. To the left. OK. Thanks. Hello. Where the hell were you, De Luca? Man. Caucasian. Sixties. Capped teeth. Tanned. Hair well-cared for. Who found it? A tour guide. We're searching for the body. We haven't finished. It's an underground city. Odd for a beheading. Between Masses and wild parties, it's a crazy spot. - Is it fresh? - Very. - "It's fresh"! - Cut off last night. Well, 7 or 8 hours ago, maximum. It's very clean cut. It was an expert in bladed weapons. - He's trained? - It's not easy. - What's the weapon? A very sharp blade... Like... a Japanese sword. You said the teeth were capped? I counted 6 tooth implants. He bought a nice mouth. See you at the morgue... A decapitated head... left here in a burlap sack... Feels like a set-up. Seriously? What do you mean? That the beheading happened somewhere else? The murderer took the time to go into the catacombs and leave the head with all these skulls. It must mean something. He left it during a tour. No. Impossible. Someone would notice. You have to leave bags with the bag check. And there are cameras. Do we stop the search, Boss? Don't stop anything! Borel, make a list of cosmetic dentists. You, take care of the guide and tourists. I want a list of everyone with access to the catacombs. Get to work! Maybe the murderer didn't use the main entrance, but another one? - What is he? A cataphile? Someone who knows the catacombs well. Look into that, if I dare say so. Take a photo, De Luca. Stop your scribbling. I'd just started my first tour. I'd brought the group to the ossuary. I was telling them about the catacombs' origin. And... Then I saw the bag. What did you do? Try to remember. Take your time. I went over to it... Who has access to the catacombs? Commander De Luca, Eva Lebouc. Do the employees have keys? No. The guard has them. We talked to him. He was with his wife, and the keys weren't stolen. You don't need keys to get to the catacombs. Cataphiles always come in through secret entrances. Is there a map? Of course. Speak to the site manager. - What's his name? - Alexandre de Montalembert. Carnavalet Museum of Parisian History We have to keep an eye out. But rest assured. I've taken steps to secure the entries. The cops want to see the CCTV. Let them. We're an effective division, right? Please go back to your offices. Excuse me. Commander De Luca, Major Crimes. Oh, yes. My secretary told me. Please sit down. Do you have an identity? We're looking for a body. If you want to search 250 km, it'll take a while. Exactly. Can you show me a detailed map? My colleagues provided one. Yes. I need one that shows the secret passages. - Non-authorized entries? Yes! A confidential map. It's over here. Most of these entries are closed, or patrolled by GMI. General Mines Inspection. Show me where the head was. Right... here. Where's the nearest entrance? It's not hard... right here. If I recall, there's a gate blocking it. I'd like to see it. I can organize something. I should go at night. I want to visit in the same conditions. Profiler? Not really, but I work a little like that. Give me your number. I'll find a guide. Do you have a pen? Here. Sorry to do this to you, but... Do you recognize this face? Oh, wow... I warned you. No, it's not that. It doesn't look like a beheading. Because it's fresh. Just a moment... Do you recognize him? What... Yes. I've seen him... It can't be! Yes, it's him... Who is it? Maximilien Müller. A world-famous contemporary artist. Step it up. The press will be there. I won't tell them the victim's identity. Not yet. You can't hide it. Give me a day to see the family. - Counsel. - Hello. His only family is his wife, Lydia. Be careful. She's as famous as her husband. - Let's go, Boss. - Where? To see the widow. Yesterday we found... See if the body isn't under their bed. Stay here. There's work to do. De Luca, come with me. - Yes? - Police. - Please wait here. - Thank you. Thank you. Lydia Müller was an underground icon in the 1970s. My wife... My wife loved her... Got to be careful with an icon, he says. - Who? - The prosecutor. Yes, of course. So don't say anything. She'll see you. - Hello. - Ma'am. You wanted to see me, Inspector? Commissioner Rousseau. This is Commander De Luca. - Come in. - Thank you. Please, sit down. Thank you. Lucie, can you tell London Mr. Rupe hasn't changed his mind? And find my husband. Tea? Coffee? - Tea, please. - Coffee for me. It's about Max, isn't it? - Yes. - What did he do, this time? - This time? It's not the first time the police have come here. You know artists. They always need excitement, to rebel. Like spoiled kids. Max is no exception. When was the last time the police were here? New Year's Day. Who is Mr. Rupe? A collector. He wants to buy one of Max's paintings. He was supposed to see Max this morning. Max didn't go. He likes standing up collectors. He likes turning off his phone for days. He loves it when people worry about him. So what did my husband do? Has there been an accident? Can you give me the address of his workshop, Mrs Müller? 2, rue de Montpensier. - What unit are you? - Major Crimes. There's light. Over there. Oh, shit! Oh, God! And there are two of them! Hello, Duarte. Send me the coroner and CSI. 2, rue de Montpensier. We've got 2 bodies. She wasn't young. Who was she? Where are her clothes? And more importantly: where's her head? De Luca! "Dear Lord, give me strength. "Cast a favorable eye on my hands' work." The Bible. Book of Judith. - Do you know the Bible by heart? - Only the violent parts. Look. These paintings show the story of Judith. The story of Judith... Judith was young and very beautiful. She laid a trap for the general Holofernes, who had attacked and starved her village. She seduced him, in her tent. She got him drunk, and cut off his head. She hid the head in a burlap sack. A burlap sack. Like in the catacombs. Do you think the murderer is a woman? In the Bible, Judith is a virile character. She thinks and acts like a man. But she's a woman. Was he already dead when... I have to ask you a few questions. Yes. Go ahead. So... Your husband always... often painted the same picture: Judith... beheading Holofernes. Do you know why? It's a recurring theme for painters. Do you think it's related? We're investigating now. Thank you. Sit down. Did you know your husband had a mistress? He collected them by the dozen. You knew about it. Didn't it... bother you? Bother me? No, why? I've never had any rival, Commissioner. For Max, women were just a sketch on a blank page. Once he sketched one... he crumpled up the page and threw it away. So they weren't rivals... Never. Max always came home. Max and I were always one. - He wasn't alone in the bed. There was another body next to his. - A woman. - A woman? - Who? - I don't know. We haven't found... the head. The coroner says she was about 60. - That's impossible. All of Max's mistresses were at least 20 years younger. Did he have a mistress recently? Yes, of course. A young librarian. Just a random girl, like the others. And... had he been with her a long time? He met her last year at the Venice Biennial. She claimed she wanted to write his biography. She didn't know art, but wanted to write about it. Max was infatuated. He made promises. She thought he was leaving me. Her name? It's ridiculous: Grosjean. Catherine Grosjean. Max called her Cathy. I'm a librarian, but I love art. Max was a God to me. I want to write his biography. He didn't laugh at me. He encouraged me. Did you think he just wanted to sleep with you? I slept with him the day we met. I was flattered he liked me. And I understood. What did you understand? That he wanted me to write his biography. He trusted me, and changed my life. He was one of the greatest contemporary artists. And one of the richest. Not at all. Max had nothing. All the houses, art, things... It belonged to his wife. Really? Everything. You can check. She even had rights to paintings he hadn't finished yet. He always said: "I have nothing, I savor everything." We have 2 victims. One is famous, Müller, here. The other unknown. We have two decapitated bodies, but one head. The weapon used was a Japanese sword. Probably taken from the artist's collection. No sign of struggle, so we assume Mr. Müller knew his killer. Hi, Bissol. Sit down. OK, De Luca. Tell us. First I'll quote John Douglas. The FBI agent who founded profiling. He said: "If you..." Duarte, may I? Go ahead. - Wait! - Thank you. "To understand Picasso, study his art. "To understand a criminal, study his crime." The scene shows us that this is an organized, highly intelligent person. Who cuts off heads, but who's fast. No sign of torture. Doesn't enjoy the act. It's all in the set-up. And the murderer was acquainted with Müller's work. He reproduced one of his paintings. There's just one guy in the painting. That doesn't fit with the woman. I know, Duarte. Let me finish. But you have 2 people... I know that. Wait! Shh! The key here is the woman. - Do we agree? - Yes. Who is she? Why can't we find the head? Until we have a name for this body, we can't go forward. OK. Get to work. Bissol? Come here. De Luca? This is Luc Bissol, a recruit from the academy. Nice to meet you. Mr. Bissol will be spending 6 months with Major Crimes. Go see the team. They're usually nice. I think... Thanks. I'm entrusting you with that valuable young man. He'll be your responsibility. You're not happy? An intern! We're scrambling! Scramble with him! Well, great. Raspberry gateau? De Luca what? Yeah... Have her for dinner? I don't think now's the time. NEVER Yes, I know. It's a little complicated. My husband's only enemies are in art. They're killing art. Iconic geniuses like Maximilien are hated by the mediocre. BEAUTIFUL Yes, well... She's miserable, though. Do you know the second victim? No. But I trust Commissioner Rousseau's investigation. Titian Veronese Caravaggio Artemisia 11pm tonight. Hotel Beaumarchais, room 307. Midnight at the catacombs. A. de Montalembert Sorry, it's my mom. Huh? My guide was held up at the last minute. But he had time to give me the keys. Perfect. Let's go. The Denfert-Rochereau ossuary has 6 million skeletons. These are the old mines. They're between 5 and 35 meters deep. Follow me. Don't get lost in this maze. I'm responsible for you. I could have sworn you had hazel eyes. DO NOT ENTER You've already been here. Yep. - Want to see the gate? - Yes. The closest entry. This has always been a hangout for unsavory types. Also for satanists, revolutionaries, the Resistance. The Germans even built bunkers here. Over here is one of the infamous secret passages. Students once used this one. They're almost all closed today. It's slippery. - Are you OK? - Yes. Look. - What's that? - A calcite river. It's beautiful. Do you think someone got in here to leave the head? I don't know. Maybe. - I'm stuck. - No! I am! - I'm sorry, I'm ridiculous. - No. - Can I? - Please do. I've been calling you all day long! I didn't have a spare minute. The staff, the cops, the mayor... Even the press! It can't be easy for you, either. To think you found the head! It was awful. I had to relive it all with the police. They were nice, but... Can I stay here tonight? I don't want to go home, after this. We set up counseling services for the staff. You should go. You're my counseling services. - Eva? - Yes? Remember I need my key back. But what if I need you? My door is always open. I told you. Always open? Promise? Promise. You're like a big brother, Alexandre. You don't sit half-naked in front of your brother. What if I copied it? You wouldn't. A kid found the head, in a box. - Hi. - He thought someone forgot it. An older woman. A 3-mm mole on her left cheek. Older? That fits. It was cut off 3 hours ago. So... what? It's... It's not the head you're looking for, Commissioner. Let's try a different approach. Let's ask witnesses to come forward. And publish the photo of the victim from the opera. Publish a severed head? Yes. They won't allow it. Give me your pad. Can they show this? - Yes. - OK. Get to work. Hi, Inspector. - Uh... Commissioner. - Ah... Sorry. Do you know this face, Mrs. Müller? Here. It's a sketch of a head we found at the opera. No. I've never seen it. - What if it's a psychopath? - A psychopath? Someone picking at random. No. It's not random. The victims are linked to your husband. The police has to figure out how. I don't know. I don't know this woman. Well, Commissioner? She's afraid. I don't know what of, but she is. - He left. - Get the car. Stop here. I'll get a cab. You go back. If anyone leaves the house, follow them. Go. Origin of the World 2 Did you find what you're looking for? - Go away! - It's OK, Ringo. Give me that. What's this? - Luc? - Yes, Commander? - Call Borel. Give him the address. - Right away. Why did you hide this place? I didn't hide anything. What's in it? Memories. Nothing the police would want. We'll have to see your memories before you get them back. I'm sure this box doesn't match that tape. The widow's messing with us. Let's see what's in the others. What is this crap? It's a performance. Look, Boss. Yes, but it's fake. It's staged. There's no blood. It reminds me of Viennese actionism. A movement where the artist was like an all-powerful guru. Sometimes there were performances where the woman's body was an object. Destroyed, possessed... It wasn't very... It's like a serial killer. It's all fake. It's bullshit. She wanted a tape she didn't find. We didn't either. Let's see. Origin of the World 2. As in Courbet. If number 1 is a pussy, what's number 2? Ask Cathy Grosjean. He wanted her to write about him. He probably told her about his performances. Yes, Origin of the World 2 refers to the painting at the Musée d'Orsay. Max loved it. It belonged to Lacan. Where's the tape? He destroyed it. - No copies? - None I know of. - Why did he destroy it? - It was symbolic. He destroyed it to rid his life of an art and an era he rejected. Why that one and not the others? It's symbolic. After Origin of the World 2, he went back to painting. What year was that? 1992. And you? Do you know what was on it? Not now, Mom. I'll call you back. What was on it? I'd like to help you. But I don't know. Max never talked about it. God knows I asked. OK. Thank you. No mothers during witness interviews! Sorry. It won't happen again. It won't. You'll make fewer mistakes behind a desk. - The commissioner... - What? Calm down, calm down. What's going on? She doesn't know about the tape, and Max destroyed it. Out of the pool! It's tonight, 8:00. It'll be OK. I gave back Alexandre's key. You'll find a way. When a girl bothers you, she wants one thing. Know what I mean? But with De Luca, you never know. From what I see, she's not into men. She's discreet about what she does at home. She isn't really at home. Oh, you didn't know! She's crashing at the boss's son's. He has a son? Yes, but... he's not there. Where is he? - He disappeared. - What do you mean? It's a long story. De Luca took his place. But I don't think it'll last. She's clever, but she tends to mess up. You see? I... Here's your mail. Thanks. Commander, I'm sorry... It's OK, Luc. Forget about it. See you tomorrow. For another chance with your blue or hazel eyes. 205 boulevard Saint-Germain. I couldn't take the train! I had a nervous breakdown. Go to the doctor tomorrow. I don't need a doctor. I need you. I know, I know. It'll be OK. Come on. I want to see you. Lily. Do you like this? It's different, right? No. Not that. I told you, I don't believe in love stories. Well, there might be something there. I know why you asked me to come. I figured some things out with your son. I found some photos at the studio. I saw this man who died when you had the car accident was your boyfriend then. Not the commissioner. Your son looks strangely like him. He realized it wasn't his real father and went to India. To find his roots. Lily, it's normal. He needed to go. You're his roots too. He won't forget that. Listen, I have to go. I don't want... the commissioner to see me here and all that. I have to go. Bye. Was that De Luca, that... Cinderella I just saw outside? Huh? Yeah? What did she say? What? She's in love? De Luca's in love! Well. Yes, Borel? A priest recognized the head. He's worried. - He's waiting. - Where? Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre Church. - At Meudon. - OK. On my way. What are you doing? The church is closed. I have to confess. I've sinned a lot. Follow me. Are you ready for the Lord to absolve you? Repeat after me. May God, our Father, show us... "Dear Lord give me strength "and cast a favorable eye on my hands' work "so I can complete "what I believed possible with your assistance." Father? Father, are you there? Father? You had him. He was there, dammit! He slipped right through your fingers. Why didn't you come right away? A lot of people said they recognized the head. Do you work out in the boondocks? He left a name. It was by the phone. So give it to me! Sophie Dulac. A retired actress. Bit parts on TV, small-town theater. Last known address: 15, rue Falguière, Montparnasse. We found her body in the car. But the priest... Yves Desproges. Priest at Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre. 63 years old. Former art professor. Yes. What is the... connection? Luc, go get the tapes and tape player, please. I recorded them on a computer disc. Hold on, pause. Zoom in. Looks like Sophie Dulac. He's definitely the priest. They're all in Müller's performances. Beheaded for participating? No, but maybe for participating in the one that disappeared. Origin of the World 2. Mrs. Müller knew who worked with Max. What are you doing with the headless woman we found in Müller's bed? She must have had a special role, we can't find her head. She got special treatment. Thank you. Fourth Head! Macabre discovery in Paris! Lucie? Ringo? Ringo! Ringo... Where were you? You don't need that. You're protected. By you? You don't know who we're dealing with. Not me, Ma'am. - Look. - More reporters? The police. There's another in back. I found a way to identify the woman in Müller's bed. You'll love it. Look at the heart. See that valve? Yes, I see. - I don't see anything. - Look. She had surgery, but not just any surgery. It was a mitral valve repair, done at Foch Hospital in the early '90s. So that valve... it's... I can't see it. Where are you going with this? Call Foch Hospital for a list of the few patients who had that operation in the early '90s. OK. Very good. Thank you, Ma'am. Mine are alive. How about you? Hello, it's Noémie. I'm not here right now... I've left her 3 messages. She hasn't answered. 12/17/1990 Noémie Marchand - Hi. Lieutenant Borel. - Lieutenant Duarte. That was fast. Follow me, I'll take you. - I'll take you up. - Thank you. Miss? Are you there? She's not home. I haven't seen her in days. Sometimes she stays in all day and leaves at night. Where? I don't know. I'm not here at night. But... Sometimes she goes to play bridge with friends. She gets dolled up, puts on makeup... And she comes home late. Don't touch anything. Please let us work. Thank you. Give me the keys. - Call me if... - Of course. - Here she is. - She's what? Well... here she is. Are you an idiot or what? Commissioner! - Come see this. - What? Luc, call a locksmith, please. Right away, Commissioner. - Commissioner. - What's this? So... 3,500, 4,600... That's some cash! 380, a little less. What did she do, again? She ran an orphanage in Hauts-de-Seine. Saint-Pierre-Damien Institute. She took early retirement. Seems like she had a nice retirement. Family money? Or was she just blackmailing people? - The Müllers? - Blackmailing with what? Maybe with the Origin of the World 2 tape. Look. She was on a lesbian dating site. - Her bridge friends. "Barefoot Contessa". What's that mean? It's her username. From ImASatire to Barefoot Countess: - "Meet at 2, rue Montpensier." - That's the workshop address. May 12, the night of the first murders. Borel, call the IT unit. I want to know where the message was sent. ImASatire... That's a weird username for a murderer. ImASatire Bernard, come here. Hi. - Open this safe. - This one? Yes. OK. 2 minutes. Here. Don't leave. Yes, Commissioner. - How long? - Less than 2 minutes. Do it! Let's see. Shit! Do you know Noémie Marchand? The woman we found in your husband's bed. I told you I don't know any of the victims. So I'm wrong to be worried about you and ask for police protection. Two... Two of our victims participated in your husband's performances in the '90s. A long time ago. Not to the murderer. Tell me about it. About the performances, and Origin of the World 2. It was the worst moment of his career. He recruited nobodies. The artistic movement was over. If he'd continued that way, he wouldn't be famous today. You convinced him to go back to painting. You made him into an international star. I did, Commissioner. I created Max. I am Max. No. You aren't Max. Or you'd be dead. OK. So... Tell me... about the tape you wanted in Montreuil. Origin of the World 2 is gone. Max destroyed it 20 years ago. Why did he destroy that and not the rest? It was his worst and last performance piece. 1992 was the year of his artistic revolution. I think the tape still exists. That's what I think. And you were looking for it. Either you found it and hid it, or you're looking for it. Either way, you know what's on it. I know who killed him. I recognized that woman. She's not in the performances. In the early '90s, Ms. Marchand ran an orphanage in Hauts-de-Seine. I forget the name. Max and I couldn't have children. A friend introduced us to Noémie. She cared for kids who were wards of the state. We had to take custody of one to eventually adopt. There was a little girl with blond curls. An angel. Max and I both picked her right away. She was 5. For the 6 months we had her, Max was in heaven. And what happened? He only saw her. I was never jealous before, but I was, of a child. I made Max take her back. I didn't want her. It was her or me. We gave Noémie a lot of money to make the file disappear, so those 6 months never happened. I can imagine what you must think. When was that? 1992. The year of his last performance. What happened to her? We never heard from her again. I'll never forget the day I took her back. She was screaming for Max. When I let go of her hand, she gave me a look... of despair. And hatred. Who could imagine? That she'd get her revenge 20 years later by beheading him and Noémie? - You don't believe me? - Well... It was her! She'll kill me too if you don't stop her! What's the girl's name? Eva. Her name is Eva. Eva? Isn't the catacombs guide called Eva? We couldn't have children. We got a call one day from the director. She said there was a girl who was 7, and had stopped talking. We weren't the first, but the others didn't want her. - They said she was autistic. - Eva could read and write! We loved her right away. Her parents died in a car accident. Are you taking notes on everyone who was there at the place? The crime scene, dear. Was it a serial killer? - That's what they say. - And she's home alone at night... - Does she come home late? - Not too late. When she's out late, she sleeps at a friend's. Her boyfriend? Yes. Yes! She's 25! Yes, I know... But anyway... She's doing much better since she met him. - Wasn't she doing well? Eva is very sensitive. She'd wake up at night, she had nightmares. Sorry. Where's the bathroom? - Oh, right over there. Dear... - Don't bother. My colleague will finish up with a few questions. - Right, Luc? - Just a few more. Go ahead. Are you OK, Commander? Can you tell me what's up? OK. It's her for sure. What's going on? Eva has an alibi. She was at Mr. de Montalembert's, her boyfriend. The site director? Yes. I called him, he confirmed: they spent those nights together. You don't seem surprised, De Luca. Did you find something else at their house? Nothing. Except she is the girl the Müllers almost adopted. But she hasn't beheaded 4 people, she has an alibi. I don't get it. Why did Mrs. Müller accuse her? Lydia Müller wants us far away from Origin of the World 2. That's why. - We have to find the tape. - Let's look into Eva Lebouc. I told you, she has a solid alibi! You call that a solid alibi? Are you insinuating Mr. de Montalembert lied? He committed perjury? - On what basis, please? - Fuck the basis! Do you know him, this Montalembert? No. OK. So... We don't know anything. We know the facade. Go see what's hiding underneath. De Luca! We could just follow her. No one would know. You just joined the unit, and you want to get thrown out already? If we find evidence, no one would complain. OK, watch the catacombs. Keep me posted. OK. I must have had a premonition, coming home early. It's Mariella. Please leave a message. Commander, Eva is taking the metro. OK. I'm following her. Call you later. Please leave a message. - What's going on? - The cops! They came to my house! They went to Alexandre's. Calm down. They've got nothing. They know about the adoption. They identified Noémie. You said they wouldn't. They won't get to us. No one can make that connection. Don't look at me! I don't know you. Your colleagues asked me about Eva Lebouc. Do you think she's involved in this? Do you know her? - Yes, very well. - Your girlfriend? Not anymore. We weren't a real couple. What do you mean? No sex. I don't believe you. She's pretty. She is... but... no. Shit! What? It's my mom. An emergency! It's true. - Want a ride? - No. I'll get a cab. Leave slowly. What's going on? - Get out of here. - What? Take the metro. Yes, Commander? Where, Luc? Barbès metro, toward Porte Dauphine. What the hell for? I saw Eva at Only Girl. - Where? Only Girl? - Yes. Luc? Luc? Luc! Luc! You hear me? - Well? - He's in surgery. He lost a lot of blood. He was wearing this. Women's clothes. No! Hate crime? - OK. Where's De Luca? - There. Over there? His mom. Hide that. It's her only son. Did you know he wore women's clothes? No, but Commissioner... you should... - It's not what you think. - What? Luc was following Eva Lebouc. They went to a women's nightclub. Really? Why? OK, great. Do you realize? I told him to wait for me. He took... Where were you when he was stabbed? Where were you? You won't answer? Great. Great. Fine. I killed him. That's it. It's my fault. Go on, say it. It's all my fault, OK? I trusted you. There. Not only did you not obey me, but you took a disastrous initiative. I had good reasons... Good reasons! You lied! No, I just didn't tell you. Isn't that what you did to your son? OK. So... You will write in your report that it was Bissol's initiative, and that... you were not aware. There. But I'm warning you, the slightest misstep, you break any rule, no matter how small... you'll pay for it all at once. Can I ask you why you told De Luca about us? Huh? Why did you tell her about our son's disappearance? I don't get it. I don't know what she can do that I haven't already. I looked everywhere, I searched India. What do you want? I did what I could to find him, but nothing. Why won't you leave me alone? - I don't know the victims! - Oh, yeah? And the orphanage director? I don't remember. I was too young. You were 7, Eva! You remember! Life began with my adoptive parents. Do you know Lydia Müller? No. What were you doing at Only Girl? Only Girl? Yes, Only Girl! The cop following you saw you there. He was stabbed between 8:30 and 9:00. But... I've never been to that club. Maybe it's someone else. What did you do after work? I saw my boyfriend. What's his name? Alexandre de Montalembert. So? She's lying. How do you know? I can smell a lie. That's not proof. Tell her she has a right to an attorney. - I did. - Really? But she wanted to call Mr. de Montalembert. Really? He's here now. She's been here for hours! It's unacceptable! Why is Eva Lebouc still here? - How long will you keep her? - Calm down, Sir. You're not her lawyer. - Does she need one? - No, no. We're just verifying some statements. Come with me. Actually, if you can help us... that would be great. If you agree. Let's go. Are you OK? - Sit down, Sir. - Sir... Miss Lebouc states she was at your house after the catacombs closed. Do you confirm that? I remind you that perjury is a felony. I confirm. Miss Lebouc was with me last night. She slept over. What time did she come over? I don't know. I didn't look at my watch. Think. It's important. I don't know. Maybe... 9:00... 9:30... 10:00. I don't know. How many heads have to roll before you get it? - Eva is innocent. - She's crazy. You don't know her. You don't even know she was adopted and rejected by the Müllers when she was 5. You see? You don't know anything. You've been had. I've been had. That's true. But by you. You're using me to get to your suspect. No, I'm not. It's to avoid cops like you that I almost lied just now. - And the other alibis? - Eva was really with me. Anyway... you'd be the one to know, right? I saw you lurking under my window. The girl you saw, that was Eva. That's the night the priest was murdered. Shit, what's missing? What am I missing? ImASatire ImASatire... - Hello? - Commissioner? The murderer's name is an anagram. - An anagram for Artemisia. - Do you know what time it is? I couldn't wait. I'm on my cell. I know why the Müllers sent Eva back. It's not what Mrs. Müller said. It's worse. And I know what's on that tape. Hello? Do you hear me? Commissioner? Are you there? Hello? Commissioner? Hello? Quiet. Artemisia Gentileschi. A 17th-century Italian artist who was raped. She filed a complaint and won. But she never forgot. She got revenge through her paintings. She identified with Judith beheading Holofernes. Watch out, it's hot. The username is an anagram for Artemisia, and it's no accident. It's a message. - It's far-fetched. - It holds up. 1992 was Müller's last tape. Lydia got rid of Eva. Why? Because the last tape, Origin of the World 2, shows the rape of a child. Eva. And today, all the participants have been beheaded: revenge. Yes. But Eva isn't Judith. Think a little, De Luca. Eva has a motive, we know. But for every beheading, she has an iron-clad alibi. So... someone killed for her. It's been under our nose from the start. There are two of them. - Hello? - I have something of yours. Who's there? Someone you're not very fond of, Mrs. Müller. You! How dare you! Calm down, Lydia. Listen to me. Max trusted me with his secrets and a tape. I should have known. What do you want? Money? 300,000. Are you nuts? Do you think I can withdraw it without anyone noticing? No one's ever noticed you, Lydia. Max told me about a safe behind an Andy Warhol portrait. Bring the money alone, at 8:00. If you bring your gigolo, I'll go to the press. And if you made a copy? You'll just have to trust me. - Where do I bring it? - Do you have a pen? Look, Commissioner. Looks like Cathy Grosjean. We've got to find her. Duarte, come see. Was the Saint-Pierre-Damien Institute Miss Marchand's? Adoption placement follow-up request Eva's file. Eva and Cathy Do you know Cathy Grosjean? Cathy Grosjean... Never heard of her. Lydia Müller, you don't know her either? No. Maximilien Müller, either? I found his head. Shall we stop this little game? I know you didn't kill anyone. Cathy did. You know where she is, but you won't say. You're protecting her because this murderous game is your revenge. Revenge for what the Müllers did to you. I don't know Cathy. Yes, Eva. You do. You were together at the orphanage. Noémie Marchand separated you. She sent you to the Müllers. Do you remember? No! I don't remember anything! Because nothing you say happened. Nothing. Do you remember Maximilien used you in a performance? He did unthinkable things. He raped you. Lydia took you back to Noémie and paid her to keep quiet. But you can get justice today, Eva. Like Artemisia. I think Cathy has a tape of the performance. That tape is your revenge. It will destroy the Müllers. Look. Does this remind you of anything? Eva, you have to tell me where Cathy is. Do you have the money? Do you have the tape? Stay there. Origin of the World 2 You think I didn't recognize you? It took me a while to remember where from. The same look you had 20 years ago, when you wouldn't let your sister go. She was only 5. Experts see no improvement, and the unemployment rate hit 11.2% in the third quarter. New developments in the Maximilien Müller case, with the discovery of a video posted online this morning. Horrific images show the artist engaged in a performance raping a child. The girl's identity has not been revealed. Ringo? You should get dressed. Subtitles: Eclair Group
