In October of 1979, a death row inmate named Jack Harding escaped police custody and proceeded to go on a killing spree in the sleepy farming community of Hackleburg, Alabama. You're saying that you think he's still alive, don't you? I know he is. He would seemingly appear from thin air, a force of nature empowered by the onset of autumn. You and this town is linin' up for a third Saturday in October slaughterhouse! Stop, please! Stop! Stop! Stop! He would return to haunt Hackleburg three more times throughout the 1980s, continuously defying death as he left a trail of carnage in his wake. Are you even in there? His victims would be young and old with no regard for the innocence of human life. This game is fucking impossible. Baby. Is this really what you wanna be doing right now? Stop, you're gonna get me killed. You don't wanna see my tits? Not right now. Baby, come on. He's usually all over the place. More like all over me. After an attack in 1987, Harding vanished without a trace. And for the past six years, the residents of Hackleburg have made it through the third Saturday in October without incident. This year however, they are about to see some real crazy shit. ...107.7 Alabama sports radio... Reports out of Mobile tell us that receivers and backup quarterback Tex Coorley were out on the practice field this evenin'. Now, all I can make of this is that Coach Redd just found out Nate Barker can't play tomorrow. Oh, that's ridiculous. Coach Redd wouldn't advertise it to the world if his starting quarterback couldn't play. This is the old ball coach tryin' to mess with A&M and head coach Manny Parish. Nothin' more, nothin' less. You disrespected me! That was inappropriate dancin'! There ain't no ifs, ands or buts about it. Ugh, I swear, Ronnie, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna stay at my mama's house tonight. I know where you wanna sleep tonight and it sure as hell ain't your mama's house. Listen to yourself. You're drunk, drunk, drunk! Hold on now, I ain't done talkin' to you. Oh! Ugh, how dare you? Why'd you hit me with that damn door? Oh, I wish you walked square into that sucker. I wish it knocked you clean out! Oh, I bet. That way you'd have all the free time in the world to run around with old Johnny Stevens. You know what? I don't have to listen to you anymore. - I swear I've had it. - Oh, yeah? Well, we know who you do listen to, don't we? Old Johnny Stevens. I saw y'all a dancin'. His hands all over my woman. A married woman dancin' with a school vice principal. - That's ridiculous! - Shut up, Ronnie! I bet Johnny Stevens don't cut his own damn firewood, I tell you that. Son of a bitch tryin' to dance with my woman. I should've clocked his ass across the dance floor. Bum-ass can't keep a job no way. Ain't fit for nothing. Look-it, baby, I'm sorry about earlier. I know I got you all riled up. I just saw Johnny Stevens and you dancin' like that, and well, considering I'd been drinkin', and you know how I get when I get the hard stuff in me, honey. Well, you know better than to drink it. Oh, I begged you not to get like this tonight, - and look what happened. - I know, I know. Thing about it is, baby... I can't help it. When I got a woman as beautiful as you, I see Johnny Stevens with his meat hooks all over you, well, it's just natural response for me to get a little bit teed off. You know I'm sorry. I really am. Aw, hon. That still ain't no excuse for yellin' at me like you did. I know it, I know it. And I tell you what? When we go to church on Sunday, that's the first thing I'mma pray about. You'll go to church with me? Well, of course, it's been too long. I owe Jesus a visit. - I love you, Ronnie. - Oh, I love you too, baby. Good Lord. Phew! These must be new, huh? Yeah, K-Mart special. So, you tellin' me I got K-Mart to blame for all these dirty thoughts bouncin' around in my head?

Toodle-oo, y'all. ...kick-off for tomorrow's showdown between the Alabama Mobile Seahawks and Tennessee A&M Commonwealth now only hours away, sports fans are at fever pitch over what promises to be one of the great college football showdowns of the year. And as always, Channel 2's sports correspondent Kitty Kennedy was able to catch up with Alabama Mobile head coach Amos Redd earlier this evening. Kitty has more from Mobile. Coach, if you do need to go with the backup quarterback, how does that change the offensive game plan? I tell you what? Let's do-- Let's why don't I just drop everything we're doin', you and I go back in the office? I'll open up the playbook, and show you everything we're gonna run, and you can write it down. - How about that? - That sounds great. - Yeah, okay, alright. - Let's go! Look, tomorrow's third Saturday in October, right? Everybody in Seahawk nation knows what that means. Now, these boys know what it means and they're gonna be ready, alright? That is a Coach Redd guarantee. That's something you can write down. Third Saturday in October. Well, Boomer, it's almost game time, so we might as well get that final prediction in. What you thinkin'? I'm goin' with my gut on this one. Tennessee A&M, 17, Alabama Mobile, 14. The Commonwealth break the streak today, no matter who the Seahawks put at quarterback. Wrong as usual, Boomer. There's gonna be more points up on that scoreboard and the streak is gonna continue. I'm takin' the Seahawks 35-24. - I made breakfast! - Oh, Lordy, mercy, PJ! I thought you knew better than this. I said you could have one regular bowl of cereal. If you eat all this, you're gonna be sick. Well, I don't even want cereal. I want Catfish Cabin! Catfish Cabin!

Come on in, join the Commonwealth strut! What? Come on, baby, I really need your help getting this side of my face. Can we please just wait until we're there? - Vampire cat. - Oh, absolutely not. Last time we beat 'Bama, I went out looking just like this. You wanna go to Catfish Cabin with me? - That was 1985! - Come on! - Are you a catfish? - The Commonwealth need this. Do you have friends at Catfish Cabin? You're gonna have to do dishes. See you later, Pennywise. I'll do dishes-- For a year?

Okay, but you're not gonna have fun. - Okay. - Alright! I'm going to a grown-up party! Just stay in the pocket. As the game rages on, and with the sun hanging low in the sky, Maggie, PJ, and Holcomb begin their trek across the road to Peter's party house, unaware these will be the final moments of innocence they experience in their short lives, for as darkness falls across Hackleburg, so too does the long shadow of Jack Harding. He is a golden god. Shut the fuck up, Lester! In all my years coachin' University of Alabama Mobile, I'm asked from time to time, Coach, how do you handle a tough loss? Well, for me, personally, I like to take a long walk with my dog Frisco, scratch the belly of my old cat Mr. Magic, but more and more here in America, animals are bein' neglected, goin' homeless, and wind up being euthanized. So, take some advice from old Coach Redd, won't you? Make sure you have your cats and dogs spayed and neutered. If you won't do it for me... do it for my old friend Mr. Magic here. Ain't that right, Magic? Huh? It's a cat! Now, you tell em, Coach Redd. Randy Hale Memorial Stadium here in Johnson City, Tennessee.

Hey, what's the ETA on that pizza? Hey, Sharon, here's a radical thought. If you want a pizza, just order it yourself. Village Pizza. How can I help you? Hi, I'd like to place an order for delivery. Can you tell me the address? Um, yeah, hold on. 450, Red Bank Road. We don't deliver outside the city limits. Oh, I understand. I can come pick it up. Okay. What do you want?

Hey, you were in the bathroom for a really long time. Are you okay? Yeah, gross. Be a lady. Well, it's halftime, so can we please go to Catfish Cabin? Oh, wow, let me think about that. - Please. - Mm, mm, yes. Really? - Yes. I said yes. - Do you wanna come? - I'm game. - Yeah! Okay. Ooh-wooh, Catfish Cabin! - Catfish Cabin. - Wooh!

Oh, it was pretty awkward. I wouldn't even kiss him. - You didn't kiss him? - No! Why do I feel like you're lying? I swear to God I'm not lying. I feel like I just need to get Sharon's permission first, or something. - She's my friend. - Her permission? ♪ Raindrops began to cover our windshield ♪ ♪ From a misty morning sky ♪ You know, you guys are my best friends. - Aw! - Aw! I mean it. Today's been one of the best days of my life. - Really? - Yeah. Maybe we can do this again next week. Mm, maybe. And we're back, folks, with 9 minutes and 32 seconds remaining in the third quarter. Tobe, Tennessee A&M is very much in this ball game. What do they need to finish strong? I think I should go check on Peter. What for? I'm sure he's already got George up there untyin' him. Hmm. Peter, it's Angela. Come on, I'm gonna try to apologize. God, you're such a dick. Okay, fine! Fine! You can see my titties. Angela? Angela! - What? Oh, my God. - Angela, right behind you! That's a 15-yard penalty on Angela for stayin' in an abusive relationship. You know, we're lucky. It's the seventh year in a row since the last murder spree. I wouldn't call us lucky. It had nothin' to do with us. We were like 15 the last time. The last time what? The last time Jack Harding went on a murder spree. It's true. He's the boogeyman of Hackleburg. He's killed at least 50 people. And he only comes out on the third Saturday in October. You know, that's today, right? What does he do the rest of the time? Alright, here's Fanning under center. Takes a snap and drops back. - Oh, fuck! - He's looking to go deep. - Oh, no! - He has a man open. - No! No, no, no, no! - He's got 'em! - What a catch! - Son-of-a-bitch! We need to see the replay for this one. No, thank you, I do not want to see the replay. We're good. Hey, guys. Oh hey, Sharon. Look at this nice tight spiral. Fanning takes the snap and he fumbles it! This pizza's ice cold. It was cold by the time I picked it up, and now it might as well be frozen. Well hell, just go heat it up in the oven. I'm sure Peter won't mind. And if he does, he can suck it. Good idea, Lester. You think of everything. And it's so good to see John Rider back on the field after being suspended for the last two games after a reckless driving charge. Where is everyone? Uh, Let's see. George vanished upstairs a long time ago. Angela went to hook up with Peter. And Holcomb and Maggie went to Catfish Cabin with the kid. What a night. I'm starving. What, you don't like cold pizza? There's literally nothing worse than cold pizza. I'm gonna heat it up so the cheese is meltin' off each slice. It's gonna be so good. Heck, don't get it too hot. You'll burn it. I won't burn it. I love it hot. Say, I'd love a slice. Sure. You guys can have some. None for me. I don't eat pizza. Got it. More for me. Hey! Sounds like a rainstorms are comin' in. Hope not. I hate rain. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Fuck. I can't do anything right. Dang, I guess she done burned herself with that pizza. I told her she was gonna get it too hot. That's definitely why I don't eat pizza. - Oh, man. Shit. - Oh, horseshit! What an incredible play by the Commonwealth! Damn it. I think these refs are bein' paid. I don't know. Maybe. Oh, God! - Well, hell. - We oughtta help her. That sounds like a job for you, Neil. I'm on it. Hey, bring me a slice if there's any left. Hello, Sharon! Earth to Sharon. Come in, Sharon. That's 15-yard penalty on Sharon for burning the pizza. Seriously, where are you? She burnt the pizza to a crisp, but I can't find her. Heck, she must be so embarrassed that she's hidin' away. I'm attorney Alex Shunnarah. I can't be pushed around, cause I carry one of these. - Hey, Neil. - Yeah, buddy. I hate to bother you, but I gotta go pee. Yeah, no problem, my friend. I'll just wheel you over to the bathroom. Neil, Neil, buddy, the bathroom, it's upstairs. Oh! Took everyone in this room to get you up the stairs. I can't do this myself! Now is not the time for semantics, Neil! Maybe we should go untie Peter. - Where's George? - No! We can do this! We? What do you have, a rat in your pocket? Maybe I do, Neil! We need help! You, me, and the rat in your pocket. Hey, guys, we got an injured player down here! Guys? Who doesn't have a bathroom downstairs? Yeah, just like fuckin' Peter to put his bathroom upstairs. George? He can blame his meemaw all he wants. Peter? Can you guys hear me? Neil, the game is back on! I'm missin' it! They can't win unless I'm watchin'! Hello, Georgie! Neil! Hold on just a minute, Lester. Come help me up, so I can watch the game. They're going to get a chance to prove it. Tobe, I see we've got a flag on the play. Definitely not a good way to start this drive. Oh, hello there. You gonna give me a hand? Hey, that's my pocket knife. Neil! - Hello? - Neil! Neil, there's some bastard with a knife coming up the stairs! - Neil? - Guys? I don't think he means - funny business. - We could use your help. Oh, my goodness! Oh. I'm gonna yak. Neil! Neil! Deep down field to Billings and... Neil! Neil! Get yourself together, Neil. Okay. Unhand me! Oh, my God. How dare you? Lester! Oh my god. Neil! Neil, things ain't soundin' too good up there. Neil! Kickers are known for getting in their own head... Maybe y'all are just playin' some kinda prank on poor old Lester. Neil! Oh, no! I've got to get out of here. Okay, remember Neil's words. I am one with the universe. I can walk on clouds. I am one with the universe. I can walk on clouds. Oh! ♪ I'm not the one ♪ ♪ I'm not moving Moving, moving me ♪ Alright, I'm gonna put PJ to bed and I'll be over later. Okay. I'm sure George will be thrilled. - Goodnight, Holcomb. - Goodnight. - You be good, okay? - Okay. You're special. So are you. - Alright, I'll see you. - Bye! Bye! Do you think it'd be okay if I stay up and watch my movie? Mm, I don't know, kiddo. It's way past your bedtime. Just moments ago, A&M... Hello? Guys? Guys? And that would really mean a lot to me if I didn't know that the world was controlled by lizard people... What the hell is going on? Guys? Guys, is everyone okay? Is Lester okay? Guys? Hello? What the hell did you guys do? Holcomb, please untie me... Peter. Holy cow, holy cow, holy cow. Okay, wait. Oh, wait, hold on. Oh, I just-- I can't-- Oh, my God, oh, my God. Holcomb, we gotta get the fuck out of here. What did you guys do? What the hell? I can't take-- What the fuck, man? Oh shit! Oh, shit! God damn it! Oh! Oh, sh-- Oh! Oh, fuck! Welcome back to the Witching Hour. Now, we're going to take a trip down memory lane. Alabama Mobile has called their last timeout. They're gonna have time to take one more shot at the end zone. You can feel the nervous energy here. These Commonwealth people are four seconds away from ending nine years of misery. We'll return to Randy Hale Memorial Stadium after this commercial break. You can't kill Peter fucking O'Toole, baby. I'm outta here. Oh, fuck! Oh, no, no, no, no, come on! Oh, motherfucker. What the fuck are you doin'? Sh-- Fuck! What the fuck! ...you can test drive the all new 1995... The only location in the state where it's available right now. Come on down to Bigelow Delhun just three rights past the Bronco Burger on County Road 2. We're the only business out there, it's hard to miss us. And ask for Jeff, but if you see Cindy first, don't bother. Tune into Channel 2 News at 10:00 p.m. with anchors Linda Brock and Gordon Long. As well as meteorologist Vicki Culpepper and sports anchor Ryan Graham. Here we go, partner. This is it! Barker takes the snap. He's looking, looking to the end zone. He lets it fly! Touchdown! Touchdown! Cordell Billings caught it! Alabama Mobile has won the game! What a finish! What a game! What a third Saturday! The Mobile fans here are going crazy! It's bedlam. They're storming out onto the field. They're not gonna keep 'em off the field tonight, Roger. Are you gonna be gone all night? No, I'm just goin' next door to say bye. I'll be right back. Well, I'm gonna get a little scared being here by myself. You have nothin' to be scared of. - It's okay. - What about Jack Harding? Holcomb was just messing with you. Jack Harding died a long time ago. Mm, let's say hypothetically, if he actually came, what should I do? If Jack Harding actually came here, take these two fingers, you jab 'em right into his eyeballs stab really far back, and then you're gonna karate-chop him in his throat like that, so he can't breathe, and then you kick him in the balls, and then you take the sharpest thing you could find, and stab him. - Okay? - Okay. Or you probably don't have to do that, cause I would never let anything happen to you, okay? Just leave it all to me. I got you. - Same. - Okay. Be back in a jiff. - Hey, Maggs. - Mm-hm? Thanks for the catfish. You got it. Plenty more catfish dinners to come. Did we win? ...pick up a sack full today. Three locations... Peter? Lester got his revenge, huh? Very nice work. Big insurance companies work very hard to make sure you don't get a fair settlement. I'm attorney Alex Shunnarah. I can't be pushed around cause I carry one of these. Pick up the phone and call us. - Call him! - Call him! It's really all I can offer. Peter? Don't let the insurance company push you around. - Call me and I'll be... - Peter? Tune into Channel 2 News at 10:00 p.m.-- With anchors Linda Brock... Holcomb? [panting] Hello, Alabamians, this is... Faye Moss with an important campaign message. My opponent Dean Klooster recently admitted he's been in therapy for over 30 years. As your Governor, I want you to know that I have never, nor will I ever, step foot in a therapists office... I-- I don't know what's goin' on. I just got here, all my friends are dead, please. PJ. PJ! PJ! PJ? PJ? PJ? I killed him! I killed him! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry I wasn't here. That-- that's-- that's not right. PJ, go, run to the car, run! He's a zombie. He's a zombie. He's a zombie! Fuck! PJ, knife. Run, PJ, go! Oh. How's it goin', Winston? Thanks. Lot of bodies in there, man. B-- bodies? Like dead bodies? Happy third fucking Saturday in October. Help! Help! There's a zombie in my friend's house! What the fuck is goin' on? As Harding's undead corpse bleeds out on Maggie's living room floor, news of his latest killing spree spreads like brushfire throughout Hackleburg. Typically, this would be front-page news across the state of Alabama. Only today is the third Saturday in October and breaking news from Coach Amos Redd's postgame press conference quickly takes center stage. ...little bit of emotion. And I tell you that at the end of this collegiate football season I have decided to retire. When that uh, final whistle blows, I would have coached 25 years here at the University of Alabama Mobile and um-- In that 25 years, I have uh, been the proud papa of five national titles and um, 11 Southland Conference winning teams, and I am so proud of every one of 'em. Now, um, as Sir Isaac Newton once said... "If it seems as I can see further, then--" And as the Amos Redd era ends in Mobile. So, too, does this chapter of the third Saturday in October. The story, however, has only just begun. Imma let you handle this. You have to keep them separated, okay? Keep them away from each other! Just get them upstairs to surgery now! Sir. Sir. Sir, this is Jack Harding. The man barely has a pulse. And if you ask me, we should let this monster die. Do I look like Jack Kevorkian to you? Get this man upstairs, so I can work my magic. C'mon, where's this damn elevator? Oh, yo, come on, doc, man, this man is done. He's already dead, he's got a knife in his face! Don't look at it, it makes it worse. Come on! It's okay, kiddo. You go take the stairs. You're gonna need this. We put a man on the moon, we can't get a faster elevator. Come on, come on! Alright, let's go. Just get in here, come on! Ladies and gentlemen, this is my defining moment. What's up with this damn elevator? You know, you're handling this really well for a little girl. Yeah, I can deal with conflict. Well, don't worry. That bad man's not gonna hurt anybody else. He's as good as dead. Yeah, right.
