We're all alone, it's a lovely day. Clau! I brought you a beer. [RICARDO] This was all different before. [TERE] Clau! I mean, my dad grew up here. My dad went to school here, with the fishermen's sons, the farmer's. [RICARDO] The Mapuche have ruined this place. [RICARDO] People live in fear. It's a pity that no one comes here anymore.

Nothing's wrong, honey. Nothing, really? I'm looking right at you. There are some guys back there that don't look trustworthy. I don't want them to see you. Please cover yourself. Put my shirt on. [TERE] Dad... aren't they asking us for help? No, no. - You sure? - Seriously, no. - [TERE] They are asking for help, dad. - No love, they're kidding. [TERE] They are sinking. I'm telling you that I saw them. They are not sinking. They are joking. It's an prank! - Dad how is that a prank? - Put on the shirt. - They are waving for help. - Put the shirt on. - Dad. - What? - Dad! - What? - Can you tell me why we aren't helping? - They are weird! Stop the boat. - No. - Stop the boat, Dad. - How can you not help? - Go get dressed, for fuck sake! They need help. They are not asking for help!

[TERE WHISPERING] You didn't notice while sleeping but when crossing the lake we saw some people in the middle of it who were sort of sinking, they asked for help, and dad just rushed by. He didn't even stop. - [CLAU] But were they drowning? - [TERE] Yes, I mean, the boat was in the middle of the lake. [TERE] Now they must be drowning. [CLAU] That's strange... [TERE] We have to go help. They are going to die. - [CLAU] They were by the shore, right? - [TERE] No, they were at the middle, they were probably drowning. [TERE] There must be no boat left. [TERE] They're probably dead. [CLAU] For sure. After all this time, they must be dead. [CLAU] Hurry! I'm pissing myself! Please! [LOUD BIRDCALL] [LOUD BIRDCALL] [TERE] Did you bring the keys? - [RICARDO] Of course, I'm not like you. - And what am I like? Claudia, the bathrooms cannot be used. Uncle said they were all broken. And of course your uncle wants to sell right away. - [CLAU] I don't think it looks too bad. - [RICARDO] Me neither. It's pretty ok. [TERE] It should be sold as soon as possible to help Uncle. What do you know about him? I talk to him every day. [TERE] Is there nothing left? They took it all? [CLAU] It's beat to shit. [CLAU] Are there rats here? I don't know about rats, but this must be full of spiders. [CLAU] Oh dad! Don't say that. - You have one in your hair, Claudia! - You're so annoying, Tere! How much is Uncle asking for, for the house? [CLAU FROM AFAR] Ow, how disgusting! Almost nothing, of course. [TERE] How much? [RICARDO] It's been on sale for months but no one has come see it, go figure, with the Mapuche burning houses and farms. Besides, the photos they posted are awful. That's not it, it's the lack of roads. How do you want people to even get here? That's what people want. Nature... ...solitude. Put yourself in his shoes, please. [RICARDO] I do. It's not my fault your uncle is in trouble. I'm very generous I help him every month. But I'm going to sell this house at the price it's worth, even if it takes 30 more years. [CLAU] Hey, Dad, we get half of what it sells for. Right? This house is half mine, half your uncle's. When I die, you are going to receive your half to share, to sell, to do whatever. Well, when I get my part I'm going to sell it cheap so I can help Uncle since no one does. [RICARDO] How generous, doing charity from your privilege. How generous of you. Leaving those people helpless in the lake. [TERE] Drowning. [TERE] How generous our Dad is. Your goal is to screw up my weekend. Mm? Well forgive me for screwing up the only weekend you have free for your daughters, 'cuz it's the one fucking weekend you've been with us in this whole year - 'cuz you've been with your GF. - [CLAU] Can you stop already?

[TERE] I'm never coming back to this fucking house! [UNEASY MUSIC] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [RICARDO] I... want to toast for this house. [RICARDO] This house... that holds so many memories of my childhood, of my youth. It was built by my parents' own hands. What's wrong, love? Nothing. [RICARDO] What is it? Nothing. Nothing is wrong with me. [RICARDO] Ok. - Tere, there's nothing in your hair. - Claudia. It's not the hair. I'm thinking of those people we left drowning in the lake. [TERE] They are going to die. [TERE] They sink in the middle of the lake and we do nothing. [RICARDO] Don't exaggerate, Tere, please! They had a boat with a small leak, that's all- - [TERE] They were drowning. - They are locals, they're not drowning. Stop over-reacting. I swear, if something happens to them, I'll report you for being a coward. We shouldn't have left the hotel. - What did you say? - [TERE] Coward. - You want to provoke me, ah. - [CLAU] Don't bite. - [TERE] Coward. - Are you provoking me? - Calm down! - Are you provoking me? No! She is provoking me, damn it! [TERE] Did you think they would rob you? [TERE] You always think people want to steal from you. They were asking you for help, not handouts, Dad. Sure, Tere. [CLAU] But don't be naive, either. [CLAU] Sometimes it's good to be careful. Perfect. Let's go get them. [TERE] Yeah, sure. [RICARDO] We'll bring them here. We'll get them warm, we'll change their clothes. We'll give them some wine, a massage. Ah? You think? [CLAU] Don't tease her, Dad. Ok? [CLAU] We're eating, taking photos of the house, then going back to the hotel. [CLAU] That's enough! [SOMBER MUSIC SLOWLY FADING IN] Dad! - [TERE] What are you doing? - Ending this. Let's go get them. - [TERE] Dad! - [CLAU] Let's have a nice day, please. - [TERE] What are you doing? - [RICARDO] I'm getting them. [RICARDO] Let's go, come with me, stand up. [RICARDO] I've had enough. [RICARDO] Your family, your home, everything bores you. - [TERE] Come on! - [RICARDO] Let's go. - [TERE] Let's chill. - [RICARDO] No, let's go! [LOUD, DANGEROUS MUSIC] [MUSIC GETS TENSE] [FOREBODING MUSIC] Tere. Were they in real danger? Was it "life or death"? Claudia they were sinking. They were raising their hands pleading. So I don't know, you tell me. - What did they look like? - I didn't see them, they were sinking. - [CLAU] Dad? - What? [CLAU] What were the guys like? Did they look weird? You'll see. [MUSIC GETS SOMBER, VIOLINS PLAY DARKLY] [TERE] There! [BOAT ENGINE ROARS OVER THE MUSIC] [ENGINE SPUTTERS OFF] [TERE] Hello. [TERE] Are you alright? [RICARDO] Help tie up the boats, please.

We went to look for some stuff over there. [WALTER] I thought you were going to ditch us. [RICARDO] No... [CONRADO] Hey, didn't you see a guy that was swimming? - No. - [CONRADO] Following you. [RICARDO] No. - Something might have happened to him. - Don't talk nonsense. [WALTER] He knows how to swim. [TERE] But, didn't you see where he was going? He was after you. [CLAU] We were coming for you- - [WALTER] Ah? - We were coming after you but saw no one. And when you came? - [WALTER] No one? - [CLAU] No. - [TERE] Yes? - [RICARDO] No. - She did. - [WALTER] Did she? No. [CLAU] But isn't it like, a little too far to swim? It is far. Yes, it's far. It's a bit strange for someone to... ...jump in the water, chasing a sailboat. -Like maybe he's on the beach or- -What if he drowned? - [CLAU] No. - Why not? [CLAU] Don't say that if you don't know for sure. [WALTER] You ride these boats and last year, do you remember? - Yes. - One just like this one... - It was just like this one. - Similar to this one. One of these was going fast... a kid was swimming and... It hit him on the head. They... They fucked the dude's face. [CONRADO] Can you help us look for him? He must be close by. [CLAU] We're taking them, right? Yes, let's get your stuff up here. [CONRADO] Great, thank you. I know where he might be. [WALTER] This is wet though.

[TERE] Put it there and tie it. [RICARDO] From... ...from the inn. And we're headed to the pond.

[BOTH MEN LAUGHING SUSPICIOUSLY] [WALTER] It's just a piece of meat. [TERE] It's super heavy. [WALTER, LAUGHING] If we tie it there, it won't hinder you. [WALTER, LAUGHING] With a bit of dish soap it will come right off. [CONRADO] We cannot leave this here. That is too heavy, we better leave it here. [WALTER] Come on! Why? [RICARDO] You can come and pick it up later. I don't know if you have noticed, but we are sinking. [CONRADO] Easy.

[WALTER] There is a place nearby, where we keep our things. [WALTER] It's by the reeds. I think he should be there.
