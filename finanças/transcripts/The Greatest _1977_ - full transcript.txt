"Italians said, 'You're greater than the Cassius of old "'We like your name, we like your game "'So, come make Rome your home, if you will.' "I said, 'I appreciate your kind hospitality. "'But the United States of America is my country still, "'because they're waiting to welcome me in Louisville.'" (CHOIR SINGING) CLAY: That sure is nice of you. Are you proud of me, Momma? ODESSA: You know I am. Is this how you do it? (CHUCKLES) No, it depends on how the other guy shapes up. Come here. Try it like this. Put your hands up, put your left foot in front. It depends on how you move. How you move makes you a good fighter. Well, I feel good this morning. I'm so proud of you, baby. You know, but I just don't feel right about it, you turning yourself over to that white lady. What's she got besides a lot of money? What's she got? She's got plenty. She's got the right complexion, and the right connections to give your boy the right protection. Oh, Cassius. (CHUCKLES) Hey, boy, come over here. Come over here. You know you're on Ms. Fairlie's private property? CLAY: Yes, sir. You know where you are, boy? Yes, sir. Well, the road's that way. John! You know this here nigger? Yes, sir, Mr. Harry, I know who he is. Ms. Fairlie told him to come. He's going to work here. Yes, sir, this here is the boxing boy. I'll take him up to the house. He scare you, son? Scare me? He can't scare me. Can't nobody scare me. I don't scare. That sucker must not have known who he was messing with. (LAUGHING) You got a good thing about you. You're gonna work out well with Ms. Fairlie. I will? Is she here today? No, she's not down yet. You'll get your orders from Miss Sue Ellen. Work orders? The only kind of work that makes sense for me is boxing. And I'm good, too. I know it, now come on, let's go. (BOTH LAUGHING) (WHIMPERS) Mr. Harry, when will I see Ms. Fairlie? It's been a whole week now. MRS. FAIRLIE: You can see me right now. Didn't anybody ever tell you not to touch any of my dogs, ever? Not even come near. You get your odor on them. It just confuses them. They don't know who to go for in a crisis. All right, but I've been trying to... Oh, I have all kinds of plans for you, but they'll have to wait. I'm late for a fitting. Oh, I mustn't forget to have the man make you up some boxing trunks, in the colors of my racing silks. I've been running four miles every morning and I've been training... Ain't that a bitch. Hey, boy? What? Now who told you it was leaving time? Somebody want to come in this gate, they gotta have your permission, right? That's my job. Ms. Fairlie's orders. Nobody, especially me, needs permission of any kind to go out that gate. Huh? What I'm trying to say is, I ain't gonna be a part of her kennel. I ain't gonna be a part of her stable. And you tell her Cassius Clay ain't gonna play nobody's boy. (LAUGHING) As a matter of ethics, my clients wouldn't care to intrude on any prior claim Trish Fairlie might assert. I don't like Ms. Fairlie, and I don't want her in my business. Ms. Fairlie is out. Then let's get down to business. As a tender of faith, each of my clients is willing to put up $1,000. It's up to my father. Mr. Clay? It looks like we got the makings of a deal. Good looking boy. Hello there, how are you? Fine. It's a pleasure, sir. How are you doing? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Oh, thank you, we'd love it. You like that, huh? What's it feel like having a big strong man pounding into you with all his strength? Well, that's a good question for another fighter. Are you saying it doesn't bother you any? You've never been afraid? No. Well, I was scared one time. After I won the AAU Championship. After you won the championship? That qualified me to go to the Olympics and they were held in Rome this year. I had to fly over on a plane. Just the thought of it scared me to death. (LAUGHING) Well, we're all boxing nuts. That's why we're doing this. We told our wives it'll make us $1 million. You're only stating the truth. The contract gives you gentlemen half my earnings. Ooh! Half your earnings. You think that's going to make us $100,000 profit? No. You didn't hear what he said. He said $1 million. Ain't that right? Well, why not? It's only money. Look, Ronnie. There's Mr. Hollis' car. What are we doing here? (LAUGHS) You see this car? This baby is bad, ain't it? This is Mr. Faraday Hollis', one of my sponsors. The one I told you about. This is his car. How long does she take to get up to 60? Two seconds? I don't know. Get in, man. God, man, look at this. Leather interior. All these dials and knobs and shiny... Hey, what do you punk kids think you're doing? Are you going to get out of here on your own, or do I have to call the cops? The cops? You must not know who I am. I'm Cassius Clay, the Olympic champion. Mr. Faraday Hollis, who owns this car, is a friend of mine. (PEOPLE MURMURING) Lia, Obie, this is our boy, Cassius Clay. Cassius, this is Mr. and Mrs. Cruikshank, Mrs. Hollis and Miss Hollis, my daughter. Well, I hear you're quite a fighter. Yes, sir. Well, your sponsors expect big things from you. Just the Heavyweight Championship of the World, that's all. Right, Cash? Yes, sir, Mr. Hollis. Would you like something to eat or drink? CLAY: Well... I am sort of thirsty. Maybe I'll have some milk. Waiter? Yes, ma'am? A glass of milk for the boy. Obie, you used to box a little bit in college, didn't you? Well, a little bit. Get up, see if you can hit him. Why that was over 25 years ago. Just see if you can. Just for fun. Well. (LAUGHING) (CHUCKLES) All right. He's all right, I'll tell you that. I'll tell you one thing, there isn't any other big guy around that fast. Thanks, man. Would you like to take a seat? Yes, I guess I would. MR. HOLLIS: I want to thank you for the exhibition, Clay. We don't want to hold you up from your ride. That's all right, 'cause my friend Ronnie, I know he'll be a little thirsty, too. He was a little shy to come in at first. I bet he's thirsty now. He'll come in now. Let him stay shy. It'll keep him out of trouble. But I wanted him to meet your family and friends, sir. Some other time. I know you want everything to go nice and smooth for yourself. Right? You understand? I'm trying to. Well, don't make waves. Cash, wait a minute. What are you doing? Man, this thing is phony, gold-plated, and it ain't worth a damn. I can't believe you did that! Oh, God, man, what did you do that for? It wasn't worth a shit anyway. Angelo Dundee. No, you got those hands too low. Now get them up. Hustle, hustle! And the hands, the hands! Cassius, don't lean back like that! What, you prefer this sucker to hit me in the head? Come on, sucker, try it. And hold your hands up. Don't hold them so low. Come on. Ferdie, how are you? Is that the new kid? The one from Louisville? Yeah, that's him. He won the light-heavy gold medal over there in Rome. Name of Clay. I know. I saw the film. I bet you worry, if he pulls his head back and a guy comes at him it could really lift. All right, so he's got a few bad faults. You'd better change that. Look, sometimes I don't even know who the hell the trainer is. But I'm learning. Whenever I want him to throw a left hook, I say to him: "Jesus, what a beautiful left hook that was." And he goes out there and does it. All right, time! Hey, kid, I want you to meet Dr. Ferdie Pacheco. He's the best fight doctor and savviest guy in the boxing business. Except for you and me. ANGELO: Huh? See, you know more than he does, else I'd have him training me. And me, I know more, too, else you wouldn't be going around showing me off as your prize new boy. He's articulate, ain't he? No offense, kid. I never saw a heavyweight move around like you do. See, 'cause there's never been a fighter with my problem. Never been a fighter with such a pretty face. And I owe it to my public to keep it that way. Time to shower, I imagine? Go shower, go. (LAUGHS) Hey, kid! How much roadwork did you do this morning? Six miles. I thought I told you only four. I lost track making up a poem. (LAUGHING) You see what I mean? REPORTER 1: Are you aware that LaMar Clark has knocked out his last 45 opponents? He's a bum. That sucker can't go two rounds with me. Two rounds. You're calling the round? Can I quote you? Yeah, I know what I'll do. I'll get him in two. "When you come to the fight, don't block the aisle or the door. "Archie Moore's going to fall in round four! "Besmanoff will stay to seven. Then he'll think he's gone to heaven!" Hey, you. What's happening? You're sure looking good. What you doing? How about a date or something? Let's take a ride. Nothing freaky. Nothing freaky? Come on, woman, get in the car. Do you recognize me? I mean, have you ever saw me before? I mean, you know who I am, don't you? How the hell would I know? Seriously, you don't recognize me? I bet you one thing, before the night's over, we will know each other. Oh, yes, indeed. I will know you. Yes, ma'am. 'Cause we're going to have a good time tonight. That's right. Give me five. You know a little soul, don't you? (LAUGHS) Give it back. Yes, ma'am. Would you park over here? It's that building on the left there. I want you to answer me one question. Are you anywhere as good as you look? I'm better than I have been but not as good as I'm gonna get. Mmm! Come on, I can't wait. Hey, brother! Say, brother! Look here a minute. I got a message for you. Look, I'm busy now, man. It's important. Important? CLAY: Ain't no more important than what I've got to do. I have a message for you. I want to invite you to our mosque. Ain't nothing more important than what I'm getting ready to do now. So, leave me alone. Yeah, but what you going to do, brother? Hey, baby! Wait! Oh, man, you made me miss the woman. She's gone. Man, I did you a good favor, brother. Did me a favor? That's worse than dope and alcohol. That white woman. Worse than alcohol. You're crazy. This pretty white woman? I'm not kidding. That's right, brother. She's gone. Have you ever heard of Malcolm X? I've heard of him. He's in the mosque and I want to invite you. He's not over there. Would I lie? Malcolm X in the ghetto? He's right over here. Would I lie to you? Do you know who I am? I know you. What's my name? You're Cassius Clay. And you know I can fight? Don't worry about that. Don't lie. I wouldn't lie. Two minutes of your time. I'll stay two minutes. That's all. It'll take two minutes. Malcolm X is over here? Right now. I wouldn't lie to you. Right. If that's all it will take. (PEOPLE CLAPPING) He's a devil. Every time you see a white man, think about the devil, and you'll see him. Think of how it is on your slave fore-parents' bloody, sweaty backs, that he built this empire. AUDIENCE: That's right! That today, the richest of all nations, by its evil and its greed, make him hated around the world. This blue-eyed devil took away your name, took away your language. Took away your culture. (AUDIENCE AGREES HEATEDLY) And what does he offer in return? A religion that says we're all going to sprout wings, fly up into the sky. God will have a special place for us called heaven, while the white devil enjoys his heaven right now! (ALL AGREEING AND CLAPPING) And we have accepted this brainwashing. Christian religion, we've embraced it. We have believed in it. But now the Honorable Elijah Muhammad offers you the Nation of Islam. The Muslim religion. A program of independence for the black man. How many of you want to follow the Honorable Elijah Muhammad? AUDIENCE: Yes, sir! How many of you will stand up for Allah? (ALL CHEERING) You know, all this time, I've been standing up for a white man. A blonde-headed, blue-eyed Jesus. That's right. Give him a haircut and shave, he'll be like the same honky policeman busting your head in. Never even thought about that. Champ, I got somebody I want you to meet. Bundini Brown. He was with Sugar Ray Robinson and Johnny Bratton five years. I want you to meet him. Hey, Champ. I don't care who you've been with. I'm tired. Champ, he's the only man I know that talks more than you do. Shoot. BROWN: "Float like a butterfly and sting like a bee "You can't hit what you can't see." (LAUGHS) CLAY: Hey, man, who in the world are you? I mean, what would Johnny Bratton or Sugar Ray Robinson need with you, as great as they were? 'Cause you just don't train the body. You got to get into the soul. You can talk all the philosophy and stuff you want. Sonny Liston is the king, and it shall remain that way until he gets in the ring with Cassius Clay. "The old master painter from the faraway hills "Who painted the violets and the daffodils, "Said the next champ gonna come from Louisville." (LAUGHS) Man, you're all right. Crazy, just like me, spouting poetry. Put this one in your little bag. "When I start fighting, I'm going to be known "as the greatest of them all. Because they all will fall "in the round I call." Why do you call the rounds on people? Well, I predict because it sells tickets. Makes people come. How big is it for you to win the Heavyweight Championship? I dream about it. I always dream about it. I dream about all the things I've had to give up, up until now. All the ice cream, all the cake, all the pie. I dream about the things I'll have to give up to get that title. Mainly pretty women, man. That's hard, the pretty women. You're gonna give up the best part of life. Me and you should have been together when you was 12 years old. What makes you think little old Cassius Clay can beat the big bad Sonny Liston? 'Cause you'll float like a butterfly and take his crown. And you and I both know that he's headed for defeat. On that we both agree, but there's only one thing. We have yet to get that chump in the ring. That's right, brother. CLAY: I'm here to tell you all... You think I'm just talking. You think I'm just running my mouth, but these two fighters in here are slow. They have no class, no speed, no skill. Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston are not in my class. They're not fast enough, and you've been robbed. You're wasting money. How can you have a heavyweight title fight without me? They're ducking me. They want to brush me off. They say I'm a loudmouth, but you wait, you just wait. I'll show all of you, because in the future, I'll whup Sonny Liston, Floyd Patterson. I'll be crowned the greatest heavyweight champion of all times. And there can be no title fight without me. (CROWD APPLAUDING) Sonny Liston! Attention, the true heavyweight champion is here! I've been looking for you all over! I want you to get all your money off the craps table. I'll bet you, I'll whup you right now. I'm too fast for you, sucker. I say you ain't nothing picking Floyd Patterson. Well, why don't you face me, since my mouth is so big? I'm going to destroy you. I bet you all the money you've got right here, right now. Right now, I'll knock you out, sucker! Right here. Come on, sucker. You hear me? This is Cassius Clay, the greatest fighter in the history of all boxing! You are nothing! You hear me, you gambling sucker? I'm talking to you. You can't duck me forever. You know who I am. Floyd Patterson. You knocked him out once. You'll knock him out again. I'm the one that you don't want. You're a faggot. A faggot? I got something for you. I'll show you while everyone's watching. I've never seen you with ladies. You're a faggot. Don't see me with ladies? You got two pretty ones there. That's why you'll get whupped. Quit acting a fool. You're embarrassing colored folks. Embarrassing colored folks? As ugly as you are? You, the heavyweight champion, representing us looking like you look. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'm giving you 24 hours to saddle your horse up and ride out of Las Vegas. Saddle up your horse and be out of town. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Is this the Daily News? Well, I'm a citizen who lives in Colorado. I just saw something I'm sure you want to know about. Cassius Clay is in town. Yes, Cassius Clay! He's in town. I just saw a big red bus with the name Cassius Clay painted on the bus and the sign says, "The world's most colorful fighter." Yes. I'm serious. This is no crank call, it's no joke. Cassius Clay is in town. As a matter of fact, I'm looking out the window now. He's outside Sonny Liston's house with a bunch of men on the bus. Yes, they were all colored. Well, I don't like to say this, but they are all niggers. Yes. It's going to be... Trouble? I don't really know. He's not here to play checkers. So, I'm calling you now. Call the police, or get the newspapers, because you have a scoop. CLAY: (OVER MEGAPHONE) I've come to haunt you. I've come to haunt you. Sonny Liston, where do you live, you big, ugly bear? You big, ugly bear. I know you're out here somewhere. You're no champion. I know you're in there somewhere. Where you at, Sonny Liston? Come out of that house. I know you're sleeping in here. I know you're in there somewhere, all comfortable. Come out of your house, Sonny Liston. Come out of your house, sleeping with all them rich folks. I'm here to get you. You're trying to get some sleep... Get off my land! You black faggot bastard! Who you calling... You! You ugly sucker, you. Get that bus away from here. I've come to get you. Get out of here. Look at that savage. Get away from here. Off my land! Police, arrest that pervert! Look at that wild man! Hold that sucker. Get out of here. You know I'm the champion. Why don't you arrest that fool? Get him off my property. When are you going to fight me? Faggot bastard. Why don't somebody do something? What the hell is this? Ain't you ever seen one of those before? I know what it is. That's a bear trap. Al Carrara's here. He's got a message from Sonny Liston. Oh, yeah, how you doing? How you doing? I was told to give you this message if you won the fight. The champ wants you to drink your orange juice and shakes. You talked yourself into a title bout. He hopes you can keep your mouth shut or he'll ram his fist so far down your throat, it'll take him a week to pull it out. I'll tell you what to do, message boy. You go back and tell him that I appreciate the opportunity of fighting for my title, 'cause it's going to be mine. Also, tell him that after the fight, don't worry, because he will not be unemployed. He can be my chief sparring partner. You go tell him that. I'll see you. That's right. Tell him that, message boy. Be sure he gets mad.

How you doing? Fine, how are you? All right. No, you. Ladies first. I forgot. Oh, no, after you, Mr. Clay. You must be a lot thirstier than I am. No, I can wait. Mr. Clay? How do you... Where do you know me from? Lots of places. No, the picture on your album, The Greatest. Oh, that album cover, The Greatest. How many times have you heard that? About 6,000 times. Mmm! No, my kid brother keeps listening to it. Is that right? Mmm-hmm. Come on, ladies first. Thank you. You looking at something? (BOTH LAUGHING) No, I'm not looking at nothing. Well, it's just your, uh... Anything special about my, uh... No, nothing special. Well, it is... Well, what I mean is... You don't sound at all sure about what you mean, Mr. Clay. Come on, let me have a drink. Go ahead, you take a drink. You know what? Yours looks pretty special, too. I'll tell you what. Don't waste time. Just answer some questions. Questions? Number one: What's your name? Number two: Where do you live? And number three: Can I pick you up and take you out tonight? Well, my name is Ruby Sanderson. Hold it. Repeat that. Ruby Sanderson. I live at 411 South Poinsettia. Mmm-hmm. 411. But I've already got a date. Oh! Well, whoever it is, he can't be as nice as me. The sucker can't be as pretty as me. So, why don't you find some way to just drop him and cancel that date tonight? Are you asking me to? Yeah, baby. Then that's what it takes. Out of sight. 8:00? 8:00. Be pretty. 'Cause I'll be pretty. You are fine. All right. See you later. Be on time. Don't be too slow. Women are always late. Especially you colored girls. Jackie Robinson meant, "Give me a place on your team, "I'll show you I'm a nice fellow." A regular person, only my skin is funny for him. But before long, you won't even notice that. That's what happened because we have more black players now than ever. If we keep on depending on the goodness of the man's heart, second baseman is as far as we'll get. No majority ever gave the minority a fair share without force. Force is something we can't really do 'cause we're not united. Once we unite, we will have that force. For each of them, there's two non-whites, going on three. Don't forget. That sounds a little different. The "white minority." They've still got the power but it's moving the other way. That's what's important. Thanks to people like you, everything'll be okay. Salaam-Alaikum. Salaam. Thank you, brother. See you tomorrow. I saw who you were with. It was Malcolm X, wasn't it? Yes, sir, that's who it was. Cash, all your life you've been training for one thing, the World Heavyweight Championship. That's right, and I will be the next heavyweight champ of the world. I go to bed thinking about it, I dream about it. So, I mean, so what's... Why are you bringing this up? Don't you realize what the papers are going to do? They say Malcolm X is the most dangerous man in America today. They say he's the most dangerous man in the world, but he walked up here by himself. No bodyguards. I don't see no police. But he's the most dangerous man in the world? Why are whites so afraid of the name Malcolm X? I don't know, maybe it's his religion. Look, Angelo, when it comes to boxing, you're the man. You're the sole reason for me being where I'm at today. Why are you worried about religion? Take care of the boxing. I'll worry about my religion. 'Cause you already got a faith. Why don't you stick with it? My faith, Christianity, is the white man's faith. Your Jesus is white. Your angels are white. Your Lord's Supper is white. Everything's white. I have to die before I go to heaven. You have everything now. Let me worry about my religion. Champ, Bill McDonald is on the phone. He wants to see you down in his office. I don't think he likes you no more. Now he's all upset. He heard about Malcolm X. What do you mean, he don't like me? All right. He don't like nothing but some money. Whatever nigger can make some money. If Liston wins, then they'll be his nigger. Look. What do I care about Bill McDonald? Wait a minute, just play it cool. Don't get aggravated and don't get him aggravated. After all, there is a compromise, for Christ's sake! All right, for Allah's sake. Okay, for Allah's sake. All right. We'll make it. I love you. You flew to New York last week with Malcolm X? Mmm-hmm. Visited a mosque of the Nation of Islam there? You have two black, Muslim security guards in your camp, and Muslim women doing your cooking? Why? I don't understand. What do you mean, why? I don't eat pork no more. I'm going to accept the Islamic faith. Malcolm X is a brother and a friend. And I have cooking who I want to cook at my house. Malcolm X should be... I can go where I want with Malcolm X. Malcolm X and his family are your guests here in Miami. That's right. What about it? He's a black. He's my brother. He's my friend. I can do what I want to. I want you... Why am I explaining to you... Wait a minute! Listen. Fire the guards and the cooks. Persuade Malcolm X to get out of town, and go on radio and TV tonight and tell the American people that you have no connection with the Muslims. Why? Just because of the fight? Because I'm going to make some money? You think I'll deny the Muslim faith, which I love and accept? You think I'm going to deny Elijah Muhammad, the great leader for the black people of America? Deny Malcolm X? You're not Muslim yet. I'm going to be one. You're not one yet and you'll make over $400,000 in this fight, plus the... I don't care about that. You're making money, too. You wouldn't be in on it. Listen to me. Listen. You have a chance to make millions if you win the title. I'll compromise, if that's the case. I'm not going to deny my religion. I won't run Malcolm X out of town. I'm not going to fire my cooks. I'll stay quiet. I won't do nothing until the fight's over. That's no concession. You're not giving up a thing. Make an announcement, or no fight. And you'll never get another chance at the title. Is that why I'm here? That's right. I'll announce it right now... Announce what? ...unless you tell me what you'll do. Here's what I'm not going to do. I won't renounce my religion. You said that. Don't run off at the mouth, Cassius. I'll call off the fight. Call the fight off. To hell with you. You'll get to meet my people two days ahead of time. They weren't coming till Friday. I want to meet your mother. Yes, she'd like to meet you, too. How do you know for sure, when he put it to you, you'd be giving all this up? When you think about it, it was simple. For me to turn down what I believe in and my people, the black people, just to please white folks, to get this fight. In 10 or 15 years, when I'm no longer fighting, and the white has no more use for me, and black people remember what I did and turn their backs on me, then I'm really in trouble. (HONKING) Hey, Cash! Yeah. Angelo, what's up? Mr. McDonald wants to talk to you. Mr. McDonald, I'm surprised to see you. I thought about what you said, about your right to your religious faith. That's part of the American principle. Thank you. We don't want you to say anything till after the fight. Right. Give a little, take a little, right? I'll see you tomorrow. Everything is still on. Thank you. Quiet. Quiet, everyone. The heavyweight champion of the world, Sonny Liston. Weighing 218 pounds. CLAY: I'm the greatest fighter that ever lived. The world is going to find out tonight. Slip on out of here. No telling what Clay's going to pull. No, I'm going to wait on that faggoty nigger. Give him my evil eye. Stare him down, same way I done Patterson. I've come to destroy Sonny Liston. Don't you also know how great I am? People say I'm just talking. They call me a bigmouth. After this, you're going to see. (ALL CLAMORING) I am the greatest. Tell the whole world. Tell them all. I'm the man. I'm the man. Tell the whole world I'm the champ. I'll destroy that sucker. (CONTINUES SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) I'm the greatest. I'm the meanest. There he is. There he is. You don't scare me. I don't care about Sonny Liston. I can't wait. I can't wait. I'm going to knock you out, sucker. I'm going to knock you out. I'm pretty. You're ugly. You won't have a chance. You're too slow. Floyd Patterson was scared of you. Floyd Patterson was scared of you. I'm not scared of you. I don't care about your fist. MAN: Yes. That's right. I'm not scared of you. You're a fag. A fag? (CLAMORING) You ain't nothing! Sit down! You ain't nothing! You ain't nothing! 'Cause I'm gonna kick your you-know-what. Easy, easy. Your blood pressure. Come on, doc. What is it? 200 over 100, and his pulse is going wild. If his pressure doesn't go down, there'll be no fight. Let's go. Get him out of there. (BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR PUMPING) That's 120 over 80. Now, why did you do that, Cash? You scared the hell out of us. (CHUCKLES) I heard Liston wasn't scared of nothing. As a matter of fact, he scares everybody. Everybody is scared of him. I figured if I act crazier that would really scare him, because you never know what a nut's going to do. It scared you all, too. ANNOUNCER: Clay puts a jab on the mouth. Another one-two. A left and a right to the jaw. A right that grazes the chin of Sonny Liston. Clay feints a left hand and gives a right that goes over the head. Liston catches up with Clay, and drives both hands to the body. He's hooking hard to the midsection. For the first time, Liston looks alive. Clay is way ahead as he drives a right hand to the jaw. Liston is puffing around the eye. Over in Liston's corner, he's badly beaten up. They're applying ointment to the eye. That right eye is very swollen. I doubt if Liston can continue. And if he cannot, there will be a new champion. No, Sonny Liston cannot continue. Cassius Clay is the champion by a knockout, as Liston cannot come out for the second round. Clay does a victory dance. His handlers are jubilant. They're picking him up. The crowd is going wild. Cassius Clay, the heavyweight champion of the world and a beaten-up Sonny Liston. I am the greatest! (REPORTERS CHEERING) REPORTER 1: When did you know he wasn't coming back, Champ? Hold it. First things first. Now, listen, let's get it straight. Just don't forget it. Sonny Liston was supposed to destroy me. How wrong all of you were. You got to admit it. You got to all bow and tell me that I'm the greatest. That's right. I have another announcement I have to make. The name Clay, Cassius Clay, my name is no longer Cassius Clay. (REPORTERS CHATTERING) That's right. You've heard the rumors. I am a Muslim. That's my religion now. My religion is Islam, and the Honorable Elijah Muhammad has named me Muhammad Ali. You are a black Muslim? Black Muslim. It's just Muslim. We have white Muslims, brown, red, yellow. We have all colored Muslims. We have different colored Christians. You don't ask a man if he's a black or white Christian. Another announcement I want to make. My manager is now the son of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. The Lowell sponsoring group has allowed him to be my manager. Herbert Muhammad. I want you to meet him. Could you come here, brother Herbert? From now on, he will be my adviser and he will call the shots. He's a spiritual leader. I've a question. What does he know about boxing, Cassius? REPORTER 2: And what about your Louisville sponsor? Do you think we're going to go along with this black Muslim business? You'll still be Cassius Clay to me. ALI: You want to keep me a slave. I'm known as Muhammad Ali. Cassius Clay is dead. You, of all people, should know that. Why should I know that? Because there was your article I read this morning. You said, "Sonny Liston will murder Cassius Clay." (ALL LAUGHING) (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) Boy, I got all the girlfriends tonight, and all these ugly men. Hey, Champ. How you feel, baby? I feel pretty good. Just a little hot and thirsty. Could have a cold ginger ale or something. Okay, let's go. This dress. I don't like these types of clothes. It's too short. Your chest is showing. I don't want you parading around here, especially with me. Let me get a waiter. He can take care of it. I've been sitting here. I'd like to get up and move around some. Hold it. I said no. Just stay right here. Let me get you a drink. Hold it. Why are you so anxious to run around and find me a drink in this type of dress? Parading around with your legs out and your breasts showing. You bought me this dress. I bought you the dress for me. For me and you. I told you. For me to watch around the house, not for everybody out here to see. I need a drink. And it ain't going to be no damn ginger ale. (GLASS SHATTERS) (SHOUTING ANGRILY) Get off of me! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) You make no sense. Stop it. It don't make no sense. You'll dress like I tell you. You come with me. Get through here. How are you going to be my woman if everything you are doing is embarrassing me tonight? My woman walking around with her chest all out. Your knees all out and your dress 5 inches over your legs, with horny crackers and niggers looking at you, drooling at the mouth. You bought this dress. You picked it out. Let me out. Hold it, woman. If it was just a dress, it wouldn't be so bad. It ain't just a dress. Look at all that makeup on your face. You told me you were going to stop it. Powder and rouge. You're smoking, even took a drink. I don't belong to you. We're not married. Come here. How you going to be my wife? Everything you're doing don't represent me. You're against my religion and everything. I'll tell you what you're going to do tonight. This dress is going to come down 2 inches over your knees. Let me out of here. Stop it, you're tearing it. (FABRIC RIPPING) Come back here! You've got no clothes on! WOMAN: What happened to your dress? MAN: I explained to Mr. Muhammad that this contract gives his man 20% of all ancillary rights, including closed-circuit television. I told him there was a bonus of $50,000 for him personally, the day the Champ signs the deal. Mr. Muhammad said, "Not enough money." All right, so we agreed already. We'll make him a final offer. $75,000. If you're going to give me that much money for my fighter to take 20%, you really ought to give him 40. (LAUGHING) You're crazy. No way. That can't happen. Better than that, is to cut out all of you middlemen, start our own ancillary company, and give him 50%. I wouldn't try that. You don't know it, gentlemen, but almost every black fighter in the history of boxing, ended up broke. That is not going to happen to Muhammad Ali. (EXHALES) Maybe you don't know my reputation, Mr. Muhammad, as a prophet. Hmm? So many times I've said, something terrible is going to happen to a particular fellow. And what do you think happens? He comes to grief. (LAUGHING) That's very interesting, Mr. Curtis. You see, because I'm a bit of a psychic myself. And I'm predicting that if any grief comes to anyone I know, there's going to be twice as much of the same to whoever caused it. REPORTER 1: Do you know you've been reclassified in the draft? No, sir. All I know is the last they had me pretty dumb. I was classified 1Y. That's because you flunked the intelligence test, right? Yeah, I flunked it. I told you all I was the greatest. Never said I was the smartest. Right. They've got you reclassified 1A, which means you can be inducted at any time. Ain't that something? That shows you how wise they are to reclassify me, switch me to 1A without a test. Maybe they got some heavy mail about why you're not over there doing your job. How would you feel about that? Being sent to Vietnam? Don't feel nothing. I'm not excited at all. You're not interested in going there to fight for freedom? Fight for freedom? Fight whose freedom? I'm not free right here. We've places on Miami Beach I can't go. My people aren't free. Fighting for who? Fighting the enemy. Whose enemy? The Vietcong never called me no nigger. They're your enemy, not mine. Niggers ain't crazy. REPORTER 2: Incredible, totally incredible. Sport's personality, now page one, newspapers throughout the world, radio and TV. He fought them one at a time. Maybe the pound for pound greatest in history. Now he challenges the policy... (TELEPHONE RINGS) ...if not the conscience, of the nation. Sam Geisen, for News Center. REPORTER 1: Now they've reclassified you 1A, which means you can be inducted at any time. ALI: That shows you how wise they are to reclassify me 1A without even checking me out. REPORTER 3: Maybe they got some heavy mail about why you're not over there doing your job. REPORTER 1: How would you feel about that? Being sent to the war in Vietnam? ALI: How would I feel? I haven't even thought about it. Can I have a little service? REPORTER 4: You're not interested in going there to fight for freedom? ALI: Fight for freedom? Who wants to hear that loudmouth, Muhammad Ali? You can't talk that way about... Surprised you! Tricked you, didn't I? I'm sorry. No, that's all right. Don't be sorry. I like your spirit. What I'd like right now is some service. What can I do for you? Well, you know I'm new in town, right? I don't know my way around. I don't know nobody. Well, to tell you the truth, I'm lonely. A man like you, lonely. "A man like you, lonely." You figure because I'm Muhammad Ali, nice looking, I have everything I want. Parties, women, just everything waiting for me, right? Something like that. Well, it's not so. And then it is so. I don't have too much trouble, but I don't appreciate things that come too easy. I was just walking across the street, I saw this pretty sister over here. I thought I would just come over here and, uh... What I'm really trying to say, sister... Do you know what I really want? Some cupcakes? Um... We have... Our specialty is bean pie. And we have carrot cake and... Everything here is fresh baked. Well, if that's the case, I'll take some bean pie. I'll take some cupcakes. I'll take some carrot cake, and most of all, I'll take you out to dinner tonight. (LAUGHING) I can't go out to dinner with you. I mean, you'd have to ask my parents. I've already done that. I've already asked your parents. I've talked to them already. I figured you'd say that. So, I'm a step ahead of you. You know my parents? I know your parents, I know you. I've watched you at the mosque. I saw you at the religious services. I even talked to your father, met your mother. I even know your name. What's my name? Your name is Belinda, right? Well, what did they say? They told me that I'd have to watch it. Your father said because you're still kind of young yet. What did you say? I said to him I realize you're young. I can wait a few days. You're gonna get older. But you're so big for your size, I told him I hope you stop growing. (CUSTOMERS LAUGHING) They're fighting. Ooh! He hit that woman. What's that? Look. (CROWD SHOUTING) Can anybody tell me how I can stay out of jail? Well, you gotta make that first step to find out. "Kiss ass, kiss ass, nigger man," they holler. Nigger was yesterday. What did Herbert say? Herbert said I can take the step or not take the step. It's up to me. Herbert is my conscience. Herbert had two brothers, three brothers that went to jail for not going into the Army. I'll wait for you here. Good luck, fellas. OFFICER: Line up in alphabetical order. First four in front and so forth. You're about to be inducted into the Armed Forces of the United States, in the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, or the Air Force, as indicated by the service announced following your name when called. You will take one step forward as your name and service are called. And such a step will constitute your induction into the service indicated. John Allen, Navy. James Austin, Army. Louis Cerrato, Army. Cassius Clay, Army. Cassius Clay, Army. Please step forward and be inducted into the Armed Forces of the United States. (WHISPERS) I'll take him into the Major's office. All right. Follow me, please. OFFICER: Lyle Cornels, Army. Sit down, young man. Yes, sir. You'll have another chance in a few minutes to reconsider and be inducted. You'll go back, they'll call your name, and they'll tell you once again to take that step. Well, sir, I'd rather not do that 'cause it'd just be wasting everyone's time. It's not a waste of time. It's standard procedure. There are a few things that I would like to tell you before you get that second chance. The first is that your legal defense is ridiculous. I'm a lawyer in civilian life, and your claim to be an Islamic minister is just silly. So is your case on the grounds of your own religious convictions. Lots of your fellow Muslims are in the Army now. Public opinion is going to be much rougher on you because of the special rewards and the privileges that you've had. They're not going to be satisfied to see you in a dungeon. They're going to want your blood. Excuse me, Major, I couldn't resist butting in. How do you do? I'm Colonel Cedrich. Sit down, please. First thing my kid'll ask me tonight is did I talk to the Champ? You know, I saw both the Terrell and the Williams fights, and Patterson in Las Vegas the year before. We were just talking about what it means to resist induction. Mmm-hmm. Have you talked about what it means to accept for a man of Mr. Ali's talents? I wonder if you realize how unlikely it would be for the Army to send you as a combat soldier to Vietnam. If we draft a chemistry professor, we don't put him into a combat infantry unit with a rifle in his hands. And we wouldn't put a rifle in your hands. Of course not. Morale is very important to us. And sports are very important for morale. Do you know what Sergeant Joe Lewis did in World War II? Yes, sir. I think he boxed exhibitions, did personal appearances, and things like that. Right. Now, there are no guarantees, but you can be quite sure that's what you'll be doing after basic training. We'd be crazy to use you where you don't have the most value. Value for who? I mean, everybody knows where I stand. I'm against the war in Vietnam. I've said to the press I don't think black people should go to Vietnam and fight Asians who've never lynched us, raped us, called us "niggers", deprived us of freedom, justice, equality, for the same white man who's not freeing us here in America. My conscience won't allow me to go. However, I won't have to go. You offer me deals where I probably won't have to fight or I could have it easy, or do like Joe Lewis did. But still, I know you're using me to lead people to the service, which is leading them to the slaughter. And my conscience will still bother me. Sir, I'd just rather go to jail. ...sentences you to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. (CROWD GROANING) (GAVEL POUNDING) Come to order, please. Bail to be continued. We plan to appeal, Your Honor. You made that clear, Mr. Eskridge. Court is adjourned. BAILIFF: All rise, please. Come on now, don't worry. We have at least two years, the attorney told me, before the appeal. What if you lose? You'll spend five years in prison. If we lose that's the will of Allah. We'll just get used to it. Anyway, you haven't gone to Las Vegas and you haven't gone to Hawaii. You haven't gone to Miami. And just let it stay like that. Attorney, you are my legal adviser on legal affairs. I don't need no legal advice on where to have honeymoons. Mmm-hmm. You're going to pay with credit cards? Well, just let me have a look at them. Yeah, there you go. I don't understand. Is that all of them? You got any more in there? No. That's it. You think they're not up-to-date? They're fine, they're fine. Why did you put them in your pocket? Do you know how much it'll cost to take this case to the Supreme Court? We never talked about fees. Fees can always be deferred. I'm talking about court costs. What kind of bread are you talking about? How much do you have in the bank? Uh... Well, you need that and a lot more. Believe me. Excuse us, please. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) MAN: Are you still number one? It'll all be going out, and nothing coming in to live on. You made it to the top of the mountain, champ, but it's as steep going down as it was coming up, and a hell of a lot faster. You got to get used to another kind of life. I don't care about that. I've been broke longer than I've been rich. I mean, I can adjust to that. We'll see. I mean, in just the last few days things have changed. The conditions are changed. It's still the same for me. Isn't it for you? How can it be when I'm not the champion? They took my title. I don't want you for your title. I appreciate that, and I know it. But if I'm not the champion, I have no source of income. This whole marriage thing, you'd better reconsider. Maybe it's something you don't want to do. I've already made my mind up what I want to do. So, the rest is left up to you. I'm not winning no popularity contest. I'm a draft resistor. "The nigger won't serve his country. "He's against the Vietnam War. He's not patriotic." How do we know some redneck cracker won't try to do something to harm us and the family, thinking it's patriotic on America's part, or something? Well, you know what? It might be too dangerous, so I think that I'd just better take another... Hold it, hold it now. It ain't that serious. Now, come here. Maybe I'm putting too much emphasis. I'm not trying to scare you. Now, do you really want me to tell you what I think you should do? Yeah. Well, if you take the good with the bad, add it all up, if I were you, I would marry me. Hold it. Give me just a little kiss on the lip. Come on now, pretty girl, you can just give me a kiss on the lip. I don't want to wait until we marry to find out what a kiss is like. Just something light. Not serious. Thank you. I'm glad you made the right decision for us. I hope so. Muhammad Ali, would you take this beautiful lady, Miss Belinda Board, to be your lawful wedded wife? If so, will you say, "I do." I do. NEWSREADER: (ON TV) In New York, Joe Frazier knocked out Buster Mathis in the 11th round. With Muhammad Ali now out of the picture, it means that in New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Illinois, Texas and Pennsylvania, Joe Frazier's now recognized as the heavyweight champion of the world. Some world. Six states. And the main reason I didn't go to Vietnam is because of my religious beliefs. My religion teaches me not to take the lives of other humans, and that is the Islamic, Muslim religion. The Islamic religion has no color distinction as all religions shouldn't have a color distinction. All people are God's people, for all souls are nearer and dearer to the Creator. MAN: He's coming back. RADIO ANNOUNCER: Ellis won the decision in 15 rounds. That, according to the World Boxing Association, makes him the new heavyweight champion. (CHUCKLES) That shows how great my hometown is, Louisville, Kentucky. Who would believe that we would have two world heavyweight champions at the same time? Cancellation of his passport has made it impossible for my client to earn his living. But for the proposed fight with Frazier in Toronto, he doesn't need a passport, only the permission of the court to drive 75 miles across the border, for a mere 18 hours. For this, we propose to post a bond of $100,000 to insure his return, plus 70% of the purse in escrow against any income tax claims. And as many marshals as the government deems necessary, to ride in his car, both ways, and sit in his dressing room. May it please the court, the government objects very strongly to this proposal. To grant a convicted felon the same rights... The district court, in my home city has just granted Abbie Hoffman, a white defendant, also appealing a five-year sentence in the Chicago Eight case, the permission to leave this country for 26 days, and to go to Cuba, Your Honor. Hoffman isn't planning to earn $1 million on his trip. Objection. That's completely irrelevant. Objection sustained. Petition denied. (GAVEL POUNDING) If I were you, I wouldn't even think about retiring. You see, 'cause you've still got boxing in your blood. That's why I called this meeting. Herb, I'm glad you did, because you're right. I do have boxing in my blood, and I want to fight again. I know. Where would you like to have your first comeback fight? Name a state. How does Georgia sound to you? Georgia? Me in Georgia? Governor Lester Maddox? The mayor of Atlanta is a Jewish liberal, who was elected with the support of a black state senator, named Leroy Johnson. And Mr. Maddox needs the help of both of them in order to function. So, Mr. Maddox went on the air about half an hour ago, in order to tell the world how he feels about an Ali fight in Georgia. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Do you mind? Hello. No, this is Angelo Dundee. Go ahead, I'll hang on. You mean to tell me that we might get Joe Frazier after all? Go ahead, I got it. Right. Right, I got you. Thank you. Gentlemen, these are the words of Lester Maddox. "We're all entitled to our mistakes. "I see no reason for him not to fight in the state of Georgia." I knew something was going to happen. I knew things had to work out. I can't believe it. We're going to finally get Joe Frazier. No. Not Joe Frazier. Not right off. Not the first fight. Durham said we let him down too many times. He's got some nerve. It wasn't our fault things worked out like they did. He knows that. Every time we got a state that'll allow us to fight in it, somebody stops it. Now, you can't blame him for that. He says go fight somebody else. Prove you can get a license. Then you got Joe. Ain't that something. After all we've done. Three and a half years of waiting. Now he's talking funny. How about Jerry Quarry? Jerry Quarry? He's big, strong, and slow. Hey, and he's white. Now I see. Boy, you all are smart. Now I see what you're doing. Muhammad Ali, the draft dodger, Muslim, fights the great white hope, Jerry Quarry. Stops this big mouth nigger. Boy, we all stand to get rich now. Or lynched. (LAUGHING) Did you see them evil eyes looking at us? But when they looked at us twice, their eyes popped when they saw who it was. They really don't believe what's happening. I wouldn't believe it either, if I was a white man. Here's a draft dodger nigger, ain't allowed to fight in America, but winds up in Georgia, of all places, to whup a white man. Would you believe it? That's right. DREW: That's why we're gonna put something on it. MAN: That's a bold nigger. DREW: That's right. Hey, Champ. Hey, Drew. You gonna dance, Champ? I'm ready. You gonna dance? That Jerry Quarry's in trouble. You gonna shuffle on him? I'm gonna show them all, I'm really the champ. There you go. Throw that punch on him. I'm too fast for him. I'm gonna shock the world. They think we're through. We'll show them I'm the real champ. This is the resurrection. I'm the greatest of all time. Right. (GUNSHOT) What's that? (GUNSHOTS) Get down! MAN: Get out of town, you black son of a bitch! (CONTINUES FIRING) These crackers are crazy! (RINGING) Who is it? It's for you, shall I take it? MAN: Stay low, stay low. I'll take it. Hold it. I'm going crazy. Stand up. Stand up. Hello, who is it? MAN: Nigger, you ain't fighting no fight in Atlanta. If you're in town tomorrow, you're gonna die. (DIAL TONE) Now, we call the police. We're not going to do no such thing. Stay cool. We ain't going nowhere. First thing tomorrow, we'll check into a nice hotel. We're not giving nobody any excuses, especially Governor Lester Maddox. We came here to get Jerry Quarry. That's my job, and we're gonna get him. And there ain't no redneck crackers running us out of here. (CROWD CHANTING) Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! (CHANTING CONTINUES) (CHANTING CONTINUES) COMMENTATOR: Muhammad Ali and Jerry Quarry. Ali looking very good in the third round after that enforced idleness of over three years. Quarry picks out a left hand, takes a jab on the chin. Quarry is cut around the left eye. That's going to be bothering him. Ali misses a left hand over the head. Ali is in with a light jab on the nose. Quarry drives him into a corner and holds on for a moment. And the referee gets them apart. Ali feints a left hand. (BELL DINGS) Quarry's back towards the ropes. And there is the bell. Quarry goes back to his corner with a badly cut eye. And Quarry cannot continue. He is very unhappy about it. But nevertheless, he's game. He goes over to congratulate Muhammad Ali. (REPORTERS CLAMORING) Let him through. Please. Let him through, please. Are you the same lady I saw at my fights before? I come to all your fights. Thank you. I like fans like you. Keep on coming. Don't worry, I will. Until I see them carry you out on a stretcher. Did you say, "Carry me out on a stretcher"? Why would you want to see that? What have I ever done to you? I don't know you. God won't always let the devil win. I want to be there when they bust your guts and split your face. I want to be there. If there's a God in heaven, it will happen, and I want to be there. You conceited nigger. I'm going to be there. How many of you want to be like me? Obey your mothers and fathers, do your school work, don't drink, don't smoke, stay out of bad gangs. You hear me? (MAN SCREAMING) Muhammad Ali, you're free, you're free! Right! I just heard it on the radio. The Supreme Court says so. You're free. You heard what on the radio? Right, the Supreme Court says you're free. I won the draft decision? The draft, everything. It's all over. I'm free! (CHILDREN CHEERING) Are we going to whup Joe Frazier? (CHILDREN AGREEING) LAWYER: In the words of the decision, "It is indisputably clear "the Justice Department was wrong, "as a matter of law, in advising that Ali's beliefs "were not religiously based and were not sincerely held." Now, these are strong words, gentlemen, and the decision was unanimous. ALI: This is going to be the biggest event of all times. I want you to get it right, right? When Ali meets "Smokin'" Joe Frazier. Joe says your hands are bad. My hands are bad? I've had hand trouble, but my hands will be ready for Joe Frazier. Tell Joe Frazier my hands are well, and I'm going to hit him so hard... Get this down, I'm talking too fast for you. I'm going to hit him so hard it's going to jar his kinfolks in Africa. Go back and tell him that now. ALL: (CHANTING) Ali! Ali! Ali! COMMENTATOR: It's the 15th and final round for the Heavyweight Championship of the World. Two great champions, Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali. (BELL DINGS) Both undefeated. The title could hang on the result of this round. The referee is Arthur McKinney. There have been no knockdowns so far. This fight is so close. The referee dances around them. Frazier is relentless, coming after his man, but Ali is tying him up on the inside as they go to the ropes. Frazier's got his hands down low. He's very tired. Both men are tired. This is the final round. There's a left hook to the jaw by Frazier. Ali is down. Get up! Get up! The only knockdown in the fight so far. Ali was wide open for that punch and down he went, flat on his back. We'll see how he can make out. We're ready for action again. Frazier comes after him, trying to finish him. Both men are very tired and exhausted. They go to close quarters. Ali tries to shake off the results of that punch. The only knockdown of the fight so far. This could be the finisher. The round is almost over now. It's the 15th and final round. And the scoring in New York is on a rounds basis. A hard right to the body, thrown by Frazier. Another, and then a left hook to the body by Frazier. The referee comes over to get them apart. Ali looks very, very tired indeed. And so does Frazier. The round is almost over. (BELL DINGS) Frazier ducks under a couple of lefts. And it's all over. The fight is over. The massive crowd at Madison Square Garden up on their feet cheering what probably could be the greatest fight of all time. Joe Frazier, the winner, by a unanimous decision. Ali in his corner, a bit disappointed. We'll get him next time, Champ. Baby, you did fine. Real fine. Let's get him dressed so they can X-ray that jaw. All right. All right, everybody out, huh? Please, everybody out. Okay, you heard him. Come on, move it. (MUTTERS) (DOOR CLOSING) I learned a big lesson. I'm glad it all happened. I played too much and wasn't serious. Clowning and talking. I got just what I deserved. But let me tell you something. Next time, we'll get him next time. I promise you. Like I told you when you were a kid, "As long as you keep on trying." Hold on, hold on! Back it up! Let him out! Let him out! (ALL CLAMORING) That's the artist in him. Was it ever a fight? To tell you the truth, I didn't know what to expect. How could you? He's never lost before. The question is, what happens now, Ferdie? He'll get up in the morning, and he'll scream for a rematch. Sure. And Frazier's not going to give it to him. I mean, after all the crap he's taken from Ali. Listen, he's just going to make him squirm like, going through a bunch of fights just to get another shot at the title, that's all. (GRUNTS) I'd rather see him quit. Right now. What are you afraid of? Time. Time, Ferdie. And the man himself. COMMENTATOR: Buster Mathis takes a left and a right to the jaw. He is hurt. Ali measures him and drives a right to the chin. Mathis is down. Chuvalo's driven into a corner. A left and right to the jaw by Ali. Two more. Three lefts to the chin. Chuvalo tries to fight, but he's ripped with a right to the jaw. Jerry Quarry is hurt. And Ali is asking the referee to stop the bout. Ali puts a jab on the mouth and a right uppercut to the jaw. Quarry is staggering and the fight is over. Patterson goes into a crouch, takes a left hand high on the head. Ali drives a right over the head, drives a right to the head. A left on the chin, thrown by Ali. A grazing right to the jaw. A left and a right to the head. Bob Foster, the light heavyweight champion. Ali feigns being hurt. Puts a jab on the mouth. Foster sticks out a jab, takes a right, a left uppercut to the jaw, and Foster is down and maybe out. Ali is finding Joe Bugner is a tough customer. Bugner backs to the ropes. Both hands to the head by Ali. Bugner hooks a left that goes over the head. Drives Ali into the ropes and holds him there. Norton moves into Ali, driving both hands to the body and the referee gets them out of a clinch. At long range, Norton feints a left hand. (BELL DINGS) Puts a jab on the mouth, at the bell. What are you doing? Just because you won the first round. His mouth's bleeding. How can you tell if your jaw is broken? It makes a sound, Champ. I heard something pop. I can hear it. There's a fracture. I can move it around with my tongue. What do you want to do, stop it? Don't call it off. Doctor, what do you think if I carry on? Nothing but a lot of pain, but it's going to hurt bad. If there's any danger, I'll make that decision. Just a matter of pain. He can make it. God will help you, if you help yourself, Champ.

Who's the prettiest? Who's the greatest? Get them out of here! Easy. Easy. It hurts. Only X-rays will tell us how bad it is. Oh! Can I speak to my baby alone, please? Hi. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I lost. I should've stopped it. I should've when I had the idea. I should've stopped it. I shouldn't have let it go past the sixth round. He may never fight again. How do you feel, son? I'm all right. I just want you to promise me one thing. That this is the last one. Mama, I can't make no promise like that. I was just talking. I had my mouth open, I was clowning and I just got hit in the wrong place. You won the fight you wanted most, with the Supreme Court. That was no split decision. Now, you don't have to go to jail, you got money put by and four of the most gorgeous babies. And you and Belinda have got everything. Where is Belinda? Why's she not here? She's down the hall. Down the hall? She's all right. Why is she down the hall? Champ, where are you going? Belinda, why isn't she here? She's in shock. Shock? What do you mean shock? (CLAMORING CONTINUES) (SHOUTING) Ali is dead! He's dead! (INDISTINCT CLAMOR) I'm not dead, I'm not dead. BELINDA: Help! No, no! (SHOUTING CONTINUES) NURSE: Mr. Ali, you can come in now. I hope she's all right. I haven't slept all night. If I just knew I wouldn't have to sit there and watch you fight again. Look, baby, I would really feel better if you just stayed home and just didn't come to the fight. No, that's not what I meant. If you fought and I wasn't there, it'd be worse. (STAMMERS) I wouldn't have to watch you if you didn't do it anymore. Well, when you watch, I mean, what goes through your mind? Why are you so upset? What do you think about when I'm fighting? I feel every blow. Just like I was being hit myself. When you're tired, I feel tired. I feel your hands hurt. Come on. It ain't that bad. When he kept hitting you like that. When you feel helpless, I feel helpless. If anybody ever knocked you out, I think I'd die. Come on, baby, now. You can't help me like this. Nobody's never knocked me out. And I'm never going to be knocked out. Look, I'll make you one promise. Listen to me. Cool. If you're really that serious, and seeing what happened to you now, I promise you if I ever fight again, if I ever fight again, I'll be in top condition. I promise. And then God will be with me. Five seconds. Ten seconds to go. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Time. COMMENTATOR: Ali sticks out a left hand. It's short of the mark. Norton coming in on him. Ali drives both hands to the head.

(CROWD CHEERING) ALI: See, right there, it was hard to see, but Foreman hit him with a hard punch. Foreman shook him up. He's out on his feet. Norton's in a dream world. Listen, Champ, does it bother you that Foreman knocked him out? No, it don't bother me. It shows you two main weaknesses Foreman's got. And what are they? He's never been hit hard, knocked down, and never went over five or ten good rounds to test his endurance. Yes, sir. This is where it all starts. Right here in the training camp. What happens here will determine what's gonna happen in Africa. I'm going to cut out in a minute or two. My doctor says it's okay to exercise, but when it becomes a strain, you better quit. Then your doctor don't know what he's saying. You want to strain. You want to run until it pains. You want to run until your throat feels like sandpaper. You want to run until it feels like you'll throw up. You want to keep running until your legs ache. Till you're going to die, fall out. Run until your stomach feels like it's going to burst. And your heart starts pounding and you want to quit. Feels like you can't go another inch, can't go another step. But you keep going. What kind of man is that? You keep going until you want to fall out in your tracks. Then after that, you've only gotten about halfway through... Oh, man. Look. Come on, man. You see, what's eating George is, he's a champ, but only he ain't. And every time he hears them call you the "people's champ," he goes bananas. Let me tell you something. The other day, I saw George down the street. I said, "Let's walk down the street to see who's the most recognized." Hey, my man, Payton. Look, you are just in time. See that man right there? That's Bossman Jones. Do you know who he is? That's George Foreman's former sparring partner. Why former? Because Foreman wouldn't pay him right. Now he's here to work for me. He knows George, he works with him six or seven weeks before a fight. He can tell us a lot. This is a good story for the new book you're writing on me. Let's talk about how George fights. How often does he really get to you? Are you kidding? Too often. Too often? Look, Bossman, stop and think. I realize my arms are longer than yours and your arms are short. But you must hit George sometimes. That's right. Nobody hits George. None of his sparring partners. Besides, he don't pay enough. And you hit him, he might tear your head off. I've seen fighters that can stun you, who can knock you out. George is the first dude I've been in the ring with that could kill you. I mean, he can lift you off your feet with one punch. Play on the ropes, and try and rest. He'll break your ribs. By the time the referee gets to you, you might be beat to death. This man's been brainwashed, champ. We don't need no double agent in our camp. Man, you're crazy. I'm telling you straight. He's a brute. Tell the truth. If we should run it tomorrow, who would you bet on? Who do you think would win? I have to say George. (ECHOING) (CROWD CHANTING) Why are you all looking so damned scared? Act like you're going to a funeral. I'm the one fighting. George Foreman. You didn't believe all that stuff you've read about how hard he hits? George Foreman knocking out Joe Frazier. He'll destroy me here. You're my friends, and the public's expecting you. To hell with him. When you get out here, if you're afraid, just smile. Just act like you're happy. I'm not going to win if I went out there thinking like you. Damn George Foreman. The king's going home to get his crown. It's the closing of the books. The king's going to work. He's gonna die working. The king's gonna win. Three and a half years in exile. (BAND PLAYING) COMMENTATOR: A beautiful evening in Kinshasa, Zaire, for the World Heavyweight Championship. Muhammad Ali wants to get the crown back. The champion, George Foreman, who is awesome. Ali is dancing in his corner, meditating for a moment. We're ready for the start of what may be an epic battle for the heavyweight title. (BELL DINGS) The champion, George Foreman, in the red trunks. Ali in white. Ali is dancing around, as is his custom. Backs towards the ropes. Foreman coming in on him. Blocks a right thrown at his head. Ali is against the ropes now. Foreman is holding him there. And this is not the Ali we expect. He is not floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee. Ali just stays there. Foreman coming in on Ali again. Foreman drives both hands to the body. A vicious left hook to the midsection. Ali opens up with both hands. A right to the jaw. Gets away from a left hand by Foreman. Foreman's up and holding Ali against the ropes. He hooks a wild swing at the head, and Ali shakes his head. The referee gets them apart. Foreman has Ali against the ropes again. Drives both hands to the body. A left and a right to the midsection. Two more in there. Ali just stands there. Foreman has Ali against the ropes again. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Foreman has him against the ropes. Throws out a left jab. Foreman could very well punch himself out the way he's been fighting on this hot night in Zaire. What are you doing on the ropes? That's how you blew it with Frazier. What's wrong with you? He keeps stacking up points on you. I can't dazzle 15 rounds. I got to take my time. I know what I'm doing. Let him punch himself out. He's just punching. He lifted you right up off the floor. Let him. A couple more like that and he'll be tired. He'll be all gone, all mine. Let me plan my own strategy. (BELL DINGING) Ali on the ropes again, round after round. Foreman has held him there, pounding the body, pounding the head. Foreman may punch himself out as we said earlier. A wild left hand by Foreman. And Ali's strategy may be to let Foreman tire himself out. And George does look a little bit tired. Ali opens up with both hands to the head. A jab on the chin. A right to the jaw by Muhammad Ali, as he suddenly turns tiger and again Foreman pushes him against the ropes. A wild left hand to the jaw by George Foreman. Ali comes back with a right on the chin. Another jab on the mouth. They go to close quarters. Foreman misses a left hand and Ali gets a headlock on him. Again Ali is against the ropes. Foreman visibly tired now. His punches don't have the strength that they had earlier in the fight. Ali is tired, too, but maybe not as tired as Foreman. Foreman holds him there. Rips that right, a left, another right to the body. Ali was just about to push him away at the bell. Champ, I think you can take him this next round. (PANTING) I've got to get him in the next round. As tired as I am, I don't have much more left in me. It's the eighth round of the Heavyweight Championship of the World. Ali sticks out a left hand. Ali, who wasn't given much chance, is still in there, battling with Foreman. Ali opens up. A left and a right to the jaw. Foreman is staggering. Foreman is twisting around. Takes a left and a right to the jaw. A right to the jaw and Foreman goes down. Muhammad Ali has done the impossible. He has regained the Heavyweight Championship of the World. ♪ I always knew I had it in me ♪ My spirit cried ♪ Once locked in chains ♪ And I forgive you now ♪ For all my pains ♪ What would you have done if you had been me? ♪ I live and breathe ♪ What I believe ♪ Now I found my place ♪ In history ♪ How can I ♪ Explain to you ♪ The life and times ♪ That I've lived through ♪ The friends I loved ♪ Along the way ♪ Are still within ♪ My heart today ♪ I always knew I had it in me ♪ I lived and breathed ♪ What I believed ♪ Now I've found my place ♪ In history ♪
