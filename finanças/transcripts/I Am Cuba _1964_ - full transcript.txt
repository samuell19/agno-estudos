I am Cuba. Once, Christopher Columbus landed here. He wrote in his diary: "This is the most beautiful land ever seen by human eyes." Thank you, Señor Columbus. When you saw me for the first time, I was singing and laughing. I waved the fronds of my palms to greet your sails. I thought your ships brought happiness. I am Cuba. Ships took my sugar and left me tears. Strange thing, sugar, Señor Columbus. It contains so many tears, but it is sweet. And now, ladies and gentlemen, this is the moment of truth. The voting depends on you! We ask that you give a big hand to our beauties. Ladies and gentlemen. Louder. Another big hand. Louder, louder! Ladies and gentlemen! Crazy love. Crazy love. This crazy love in my blood. She loves me. I can't live anymore without your love. Crazy love. This crazy love, the love of my life. I can't live anymore without your love. It's crazy love that my heart feels for you. Take, take all my love, my sweet little love. I can't live anymore without your love. Crazy love. I am, I am love-crazy, crazy. I am crazy for your love. Crazy love. Love crazy. Crazy is the love I feel for you. Crazy, crazy, crazy for your love. Crazy, crazy for your love. Bob, that's indecent. Ah, nuts! Nothing's indecent in Cuba if you've got the dough! Good morning, Rene. How are you, señora? So-so. This heat. Oranges, white pineapples. California plums, nice juicy pears, cheap. How's business, Rene? Fine, fine. How are you doing? You've come to keep him company? Got any fruit for me? I do, the best. You see, this is what I was telling you about. I think I'm going to become a fruit seller too. Well, see you later. Okay, man, see you. Who was that? Regular customers. I'm afraid, Rene. You don't have to be afraid of anything. Look. Look. We're going to be married in that church. And you'll be wearing a white dress. A white dress. You've never kissed anyone, have you? Listen, I'll bring you fruit every day at your job. How come you don't tell me where you work? Too bad I don't sell flowers. I would give all my flowers to you. I love you, María. Fellows, I'd like you to meet Betty. Look at that, she brings her own tangerine. Interesting. No, it's not interesting, señor. Mister, mister! Money! One coin, please! Money. Mister, mister! Money! One coin, please! I am Cuba. Why are you running away? You came here to have fun? Go ahead, have fun! Isn't this a happy picture? Don't avert your eyes. Look! I am Cuba. For you, I am the casino, the bar, the hotels. But the hands of these children and old people are also me. I hoped and prayed that it would rain for you, cane. I've helped you. Now you help me. Grow tall, taller than me. I used to think... the worst in life was death. Now I know better. The worst is life. I am so frightened for my children. All my life I have worked, and all that time I have lived in debt. Grow tall, sugarcane. Not for me; for them. You hear me? Grow tall. Papa, it's Señor Acosta. Busy working, Pedro? Yeah, working. Well, soon you'll be able to take a little rest. I've sold these lands to the United Fruit Company. What about my sugarcane? You raised it on my land! But I worked it with my own sweat. I give that sweat to you as a gift. What about my house? Your house isn't your house anymore. Have you forgotten this? You can't forge a signature like that. No, you can't forge a signature like that. Pedro, your house isn't yours anymore. Your house isn't yours anymore. I've sold these lands to United Fruit. I've sold these lands to United Fruit. You grew your sugarcane on my land. Your house isn't yours anymore. Why did they come, Papa? What happened? Nothing important. Why are you standing there like a stick? We need to get back to work. Papa, are you tired? Papa, are you tired? I am not tired. I am not tired! I am not tired! I am not tired! I am not tired. I am not tired! I am not tired! Today has been a wonderful day. Just great! You can go to the village today. Have some fun. Listen to some music. Really, Papa? What about you? I am too old. Music was made for the young. You're not old, Papa. You are not old. Go on. Here, take this, Pablo. But this is your last peso, Papa. Today it's the last one, but soon we'll have lots of money. Don't you see how much money there is here? Don't you see how much money there is here? Don't you see how much money there is here? Two Coca-Colas. Give me some money. Let's go, my guajira, let's go to Havana. Let's go, my guajira, let's go to the city. I like parties, rooster fights, my hammock, and my shack. I like the curve of your waist. I like the way your hips move, my sweet. Let's go, my guajira, let's go to Havana. Let's go, my guajira, let's go to the city. The sway of your hips has the wonderful flavor of ripe fruit. So does the twist of your body. Prepare the saddle and mount the rhythm. Beat the drums! Look over there, Pancho! Aren't those old Pedro's children? Looks as if their business is doing well. Beat the drums. Swing that body. Watch her move. It's the greatest. Move your feet. Move your feet. I am Cuba. Sometimes it seems to me that the sap of my palm trees are full of blood. Sometimes it seems to me that the murmuring sounds around us are not the ocean but choked-back tears of the people. Who answers for this blood? Who is responsible for these tears? General Fulgencio Batista, honorable president of the republic, receives an award. I'm going to stop. Let's part here. See you tomorrow. Hold on. What? I was thinking. Maybe it's better not to spend the night at home. Okay. They didn't hurt you? Calm down. It's all over. What's your name? Gloria. Well, Gloria, you're all right. They're gone. Calm down. And you, what's your name? Enrique. Thank you, Enrique. Extra! Extra! The latest news! Fidel Castro and all those with him... were killed in the Oriente province! Stop at the university. They killed Fidel Castro. Here. It's in the paper. Where's Alberto? Alberto, Fidel Castro has been killed! It's a lie, Enrique. Here's what we need to do. We have to let all Havana know that this is a lie. Fidel Castro is alive. He and his comrades have landed in the Oriente province... Careful. And have begun the struggle. Write this down: Batista is spreading the rumor that Fidel is dead to divert the people. Fidel is in the Sierra Maestra. He's gathering all honest people under the banner of the revolution. Read this. They've killed Juan, Carlos, and Luis. Are we just going to go on sitting here with our hands folded? No, Enrique, we won't just be sitting around. That fat murderer is going to keep killing our comrades. Everything is planned. We're ready, but this is not the time. Why not? So we kill this one, but in his place, they'll put another. We'll kill that one too. So that's how we're going to spend the rest of our lives? What are we going to accomplish by killing one man? They'll just put another one in his place only much harsher. And he'll keep on killing our comrades! You cannot confuse people, or one man, with a system. But people make the system. True, but we have to struggle against the system, not the people. I understand. But this is not a human being. He's a murderer. He's killing our comrades. Don't you think I want to kill him too? But they have landed successfully. Fidel is alive. There is a new struggle developing there, and we must assist that effort. The people have to know everything! I know, but what we do with this murderer is just as important. Let's decide. We'll discuss this later. Later. When? When? If you want, raise the question at the group meeting. Understand, not now. Alberto, they killed Pepe last night. And what are we going to do about it? I have already told you. We'll discuss this later. The forgiveness, you sing my song. With such melody, it tries to get me to forget your betrayal. You want to come back. Perhaps you think of me. Perhaps you cry for me. Perhaps, but is that really you? Now you beg for forgiveness and you sing your song. With such melody, it tries to get me to forget your betrayal. But now don't you understand that it's taken you too long to come back and that I cannot forget that you made me cry? I won't be able to forgive you. What's the matter with you? Can't you see where you're going? You're nuts! Are you crazy? Are you asleep? You were right under my wheels. You maniac. Imbecile! Are you drunk? Answer me! What's wrong? This guy almost got me put in jail. What is he, crazy? He's just lovesick. Be careful, Enrique. Watch out when you're in the middle of the street. Don't be mad, old man. Get him out of here. Where to, Enrique? What's up? What's the matter? Enrique, what's going on? I couldn't... He was having fried eggs for breakfast. Fried eggs? What are you talking about? Tell me! He was with the kids. I couldn't... Did you consider the consequences? Who gave you permission to do this? Who? Shit! Open up! Everybody stay where you are! Search them! Whose book is this? Yours? Who does this book belong to? Lenin: "The State and Revolution" Whose book is this? It's ours. Yours? It's our book. And anybody who hasn't read it is an ignoramus. Long live freedom! Long live the revolution! Cubans! Fidel lives! He's up in the Sierra Maestra with his comrades. He and his comrades are fighting against Batista. Long live liberty! Death to the tyrant! Liberty or death! Down with tyranny! I am Cuba. There are two paths for people when they are born. The path of slavery, it crushes and decays. And the path of the star, it illuminates but kills. You will choose the star. Your path will be hard, and it will be marked by blood. But in the name of justice, wherever a single person goes, thousands more will rise up. And when there are no more people, then the stones will rise up. I am Cuba. When men are born, there are two paths. You will choose the star. The path will be hard... And it will be marked by blood. For the last time, clear the steps. It's an order! Run to the battle, fellow people of Bayamo. Your country looks at you with pride. Do not fear a glorious death. To die for your motherland is to live. To live enchained is to submit to insult and ignominy. Hear the bugle sound. Prepare for battle, O valiant ones. Onward. Come on, guys! All together--the cars! Enrique! Enrique! Where is Fidel? Fidel? I am Fidel. Where is Fidel? I am Fidel. I am Fidel. I am Cuba. These are the people about whom legends will be told. From all parts, they're coming to the mountains of the Sierra Maestra. They are going to fight. Come in. Have a seat. Amelia, bring another plate. Do you need the rifle, too? No. These hands aren't for killing. They're for sowing. But is this land you are sowing yours? Have you finished? Don't you wish there were a school on your land? Shoes for your kids? That when they are sick, they would be treated? Or are they going to live the way you do? I want to live in peace. Me too. What about this, then? So as to live in peace. Get out! He's exhausted, Mariano. Let him stay the night. Do you hear that, Mariano? They're bombing the revolutionaries. Amelia, calm down. Amelia, calm down. Amelia! Amelia! Listen, Mariano, listen! Amelia, wait! Wait! Amelia! Calm down, dear. Amelia! Mariano, my child! Amelia! I have to go. I have to go. Halt! This is the Insurgent Radio broadcasting from the Oriente province, from Sierra Maestra, free territory of Cuba. Cubans, join the struggle. You, victim of humiliation, hatred, and crime. You have borne on your shoulders injustice, destitution, and the deprivation of your rights. Listen! Revolution! Revolution! In the face of hostile malice, you, peasant; you, worker; you, student; you, Cuban! Raise your armed fist! The revolution is fighting for the complete and absolute national independence of our motherland. The revolution fights for the right of everyone to get an education and equal opportunity, for the defense of life given to each of us. In defense of people's well-being, we fight! Each family has the right to adequate housing. Each Cuban has the right to work. Thousands of heads of families and thousands of young people have no work. They have no future. The revolution will industrialize the country. It will eliminate unemployment and will restore to the people all the wealth that was stolen from them. You, farmer. You, worker. You, student. Take your place in the struggle. This is your revolution! Liberty or death! I knew you would come. I knew it. Now I need a rifle. A rifle? This guy thinks they grow on trees! Plant some. Maybe more will grow. Look, Mariano. You have to capture a rifle in battle. Every one of us has done it that way. I am Cuba. Your hands have gotten used to farming tools. But now a rifle is in your hands. You are not shooting to kill. You are firing at the past. You are firing to protect your future. Run to the battle, fellow people of Bayamo. Your country looks at you with pride. Do not fear a glorious death. To die for your motherland is to live. To live enchained is to submit to insult and ignominy. Hear the bugle sound. Prepare for battle, O valiant ones. Onward. The End
