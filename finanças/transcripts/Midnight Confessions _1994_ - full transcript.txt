(bright upbeat music) - You guys looking for a date? - There's four of us and there's only one of you. - Well, I wasn't looking to go dancing, you know? So, what do you say? - I say you should be ashamed of yourself. You're a slut. - Well, I say you have a little dick and you're afraid your buddies will see you naked. - You couldn't even handle me, baby. (bright upbeat music) - You know they'll be back after they strike out at a few more bars? - Sure, but they'll be twice as drunk by then, which means I gotta work twice as hard to get them off. - Well, I didn't have that problem with the last one, highly excitable type. I was finished with him before he got his pants down. I have like a whole night of those. - Whoa, girl, I'm up. - Give a break, Brenda. I'm behind on my friend. - Someone else is new. - I'll owe you one. I'll owe you two. - Okay. - Thanks, honey. (bright upbeat music) - [Brenda] I hope he's old, smelly and slow. - So, what did you have in mind? Easy enough. 50 Bucks. - [Vanessa] We're just past 12:00 am here on "Midnight Confessions". And we are about to talk to Dave, who's calling from the valley. Dave, I understand that you like to do some very dirty things. Tell me about it. - [Dave] Well, I like dirty things, dirty. - [Vanessa] Dirty like your mom wouldn't approve or nasty, like the panties I wore yesterday. - [Dave] Like the panties, yes. Exactly like the panties. - What would you like to do with my panties? (woman screams) (car engine roaring) Hi Mariana, welcome to "Midnight Confessions." - [Mariana] Hi, Vanessa. - How are you tonight? - [Mariana] I'm lonely. - [Vanessa] Why is that? - [Mariana] I don't know. I guess it's because I haven't been touched in a long time. - [Vanessa] You mean you haven't been touched by anyone else? - I'm just afraid to let somebody get that close, and it does get a little lonely. - [Vanessa] Well, when you do find that special someone, will you be able to let them in, let them touch you? - You better make it, yes, honey, 'cause your husband's spending his time away with somebody like me. - [Vanessa] If someone were there to touch you, what would you have them do? - I'd like him to start on my breast, and just gently lick my nipple, and work his way over to my other breast. Give me a nice tight squeeze. And then, I'd like to feel his lips all over my body, on my back and on my neck. It feels so good. - Tell me about this mystery man with the great lips. What does he look like? - [Mariana] He's young, very young, with long blonde hair, and he's huge. - Tall? - [Mariana] No, huge. - Sounds delightful. (police siren blaring) (crowd murmuring) - [Female] What's going on? (crowd murmuring) - You get anything? - Nobody saw her shoot, nobody heard. - Nobody knows shit, never changes. Now, the victim is definitely a hawker. One of the officers recognize it and move on to boulevard. - It's gotta be the same slash. - First black and white got here. She was still alive barely, but they got a description. Guy is short, black hair, blue-eyed, kinda goatee, black sedan. She was pretty far gone by the time they got here, so they don't even know if this is accurate. - Let's hope that forensics can find something. - Woman loves to be filled up like that, doesn't she? - Yes. I feel so full. (Mariana moaning) - My God, how can you sit here and listen to this stuff for four hours every night? - It's really a bitch, like readjusting myself. - I wonder what people from Mars would think. - I didn't know, Peter, I thought you'd know. - I mean if someone didn't know us as people, and they just tuned into this trash, what would they think about our civilization? - They'd probably say, "Beam me down, Scotty, let's do the wow thing." - You're as big a pervert as she is. (Mariana moaning) - [Mariana] Oh yes. - Have a good night, Mariana. It's been fun listening to your confession. Don't go away, we'll be right back. - Very sexy lady. - Well, you're talking about me, of course. - Well, you're sexy, no, but actually, I was speaking of Mariana. I mean, it was kind of getting into until Peter the putts showed up. - You guys are easy. Mariana's real name is probably Gladys. She's 50 pounds over her fighting weight and has hair in places you can't even imagine. - Oh, come on now, let's not be bitchy just because you're also helplessly single in need of a little filling up. Remember that Mitch's service station, is open 24 hours a day. I can rotate your tires anytime. - Are you kidding? After two years of staring at you through the glass, all the mystery is gone. What did Peter want? - Newspaper delivery, slasher got another hooker, we're on in five, four, three, two-- - Welcome back to "Midnight Confessions," the hottest talk on Talk Radio. We're with you every night from 10 to two. Call us if you want or if you feel the need to make a confession. Our number is 1-800-555-3469. Next up is Ryan. Ryan has the kind of problem that most men would be willing to pay cold hard cash for. Hi, Ryan. What's going on? - [Ryan] Well, it's this lady living next door. I think she's coming onto me. - You think? - [Ryan] Yeah. Well, I don't know, it's kind of weird. I mean, she's like 30 something. I'm only 18. I don't know, I think sometimes, maybe it's just my imagination. - It's a strange thing about 30 year old women, the day they turn 30, 18 year old men start looking real good. - She looks pretty good to me too. Well, every time I see her in the hallway, she smiles at me, and sort of looks at me like she wants to eat me or something. - [Vanessa] There's a thought. Is she single? - Well, I don't know. I think she's divorced. I mean, I've never seen any guys over there. - [Vanessa] I'm getting a definite feeling about this, Ryan. Why don't you just go on over and make your move? - I don't know about that. I mean, what would I say? - Invite her over for a drink or coffee or dinner. Talk to her like a real person, and watch her eyes. It's always in the eyes. - [Ryan] Her eyes. - Yes, they're about 12 inches higher than what you've been looking at already, trust me. You think she's still awake? - [Ryan] Yeah, I mean, I just saw her in the hallway, just a little while ago. - Well, then hang up and get your young buns over there. Tell her you need to borrow a cup of sugar, or tell her you heard something and you wanna make sure she's all right. - [Ryan] Okay, I can do that. - Trust me, if she's interested, you won't have to make your bed in the morning. I hear we've got another call from Al. Hi, Al. - [Albert] I just thought we could talk for a minute. We haven't talked in a few days. - [Vanessa] Sure, Al. (doorbell rings) - Oh, Ryan, what a nice surprise. Yes. - I thought I heard something, and I was just making sure you're okay. - Yeah, it was just probably me rattling around the oven. I think I leave my pilot light with it. - Well, I'd be glad to light it for you. - I'd really be grateful. Can you close the door behind you, please? I can't get any of my burners to light. - Oh, you meant your real pilot light. - Sure, what did you think I meant? - Well, nothing. I mean, you know, I didn't mean anything by that, Mrs. Parker. - Call me Rachel. (upbeat music) - I like to wear very high heels. - [Albert] You do? What about the stockings? Tell me about the stockings. - Well, I like to feel open, so I like the stockings that attach to the garter belts. You know, the kind with the seams that go all the way up the back. And I don't like to wear panties so that I can be ready for anything at any time. - [Albert] Oh, yes, oh yeah. Oh yeah. - You were listening. - [Albert] Tell me more. (both laughing) (upbeat music) - Good night, Albert. Talk to you soon. I think we could all use a cold shower after that one. We'll be right back. Whenever Albert calls, I always feel like I've done something good for mankind. - I don't know, there's something about picturing a shriveled up old goat whack in his wiener at 50,000 watts, that kind of turns my stomach. - Be nice to Albert, okay? - Okay, all right. Maybe, hey, listen, I gotta take a break here. Can you handle a few calls by yourself? - No problem. - In five, four, three, two-- - Hi, welcome back. I'm Vanessa Scott, and this is "Midnight Confessions." Well, we're here to talk about your love life, your sex life, your fantasy life, and your real life. Next up is Rick. Hi, Rick. Are you there? Last chance, Rick. Talk to me. - [Rick] Vanessa. - Hi, Rick. - [Rick] Sorry about that. I'm at work and I had to take care of some business. - No problem. What can I do for you tonight? - Well, I'm attracted to this woman. She's beautiful, sexy, nice. I like her a lot. - Sounds good. - [Rick] Problem is she doesn't even know I exist. When I tell her how I feel, she'll just laugh or-- - Has nobody ever laughed at you before? - [Rick] I guess. - So, go for it. What's one more laugh? She might just be interested. - [Rick] I don't know. I gotta think about it. - Well, don't spend too much time thinking about it. Any good fisherman knows that he's gotta get his worm in the water before all the best fish get away. - [Rick] I don't think of her as a fish. - I know, she's special. - [Rick] More than anyone else I've ever known. - [Vanessa] And that makes it all the harder, doesn't it? - [Rick] Yes. - You think about it, Rick. And when you're ready to make your move, you give me a call, okay? - [Rick] Yeah, I'll call you again. - Good. (dramatic music) (camera shuttering) (dramatic music) (Vanessa exhaling) (dramatic music) (car door thuds) (car engine roars) - You understand that you're not under arrest. I merely wanna ask you some questions about this guy who allegedly beat you up. - I understand. He was white male, kind of tall, maybe six feet. He had really bright blue eyes. He had like a medium built. He was very well-grown, and he had a gold tear around his face. He drove a black sedan, and I can't really remember much, not a lot stood out. - Go on. - He had me get into the backseat of his car, and he passed me a note. The note said that, "He wanted me to show him a little bit." And I'm the type of person I thought that was, he just was the kind of guy that liked to watch or something. So, I remember him looking in the rear view mirror the whole time, and he just nodded his head like he approved, when I showed him. So I went ahead, and showed him a little bit more. First time I showed him something, he handed me some money. The second time I showed him something, he handed me a knife, and that's when the car just stopped and he started climbing over the seat. - Why didn't you get out? - Because the doors were locked. He had already locked them from upfront. - But how the hell did you get away? - I'm a lot tougher than I look, Detective Harris, okay? When he started climbing over the seat, I kick him in the chest as hard as I could. Next thing I know, I'm grabbing his knife hand and grabbing his hair and flipping him over on top of me. I guess, basically, I got away because I just caught him off guard. I mean, I'm sure he wasn't expecting that from me. - I wouldn't have. - Anyway, by doing that, I got a little bit of time. I jumped into the front seat of the car, unlocked the doors, and just started running. I would've got the license plate number for you, but I was too busy running. - You think you might be able to identify this guy if you saw him again? - Oh yes, definitely. (dramatic music) - You know, you're a pretty lucky girl. The other women this guy picked up ended up dead. - Well, you can give me a little bit of credit here, Detective Harris, because what happened in that car was not luck. - [Harris] Well, whatever the hell it was, sooner or later, one day, it's gonna run out. - [Female] So what you're saying is, I should find another line of work, right? - I can think of a lot of other reasons. - And what about your job, Detective Harris? Doesn't your job have risks? Couldn't you end up dead as a result of something that you do. - That's different? - How, how is it different? Please explain to me. I mean, you provide a service and so do I. You get satisfaction out of the work you do and so do I. - Satisfaction. - Yes, satisfaction. You don't think it's possible? Let me explain something to you. I help a lot of people, okay? I help the husband who no longer feels he's loved by his wife any longer. I help the old man who feels he's attractive. I help the professional man who spends all day long working in the office, and he decides that he needs a little bit something different. - What do you think this is? "Miami Vice" and you are the happy hooker. - My point is that, I mean a lot to a lot of people, Detective Harrison, and that's all that's important to me. - You make it sound like it's much more than just sex. - Oh, maybe that's because sex is more than just sex, Detective Harris. Look, I like what I do. I like how it feels, not only for me, but for the person that I'm with. You know, I can tell that you really love women. You really, really care about us, don't you? This man that you're looking for is completely opposite. I mean, he notices women for their touch, and their curves and the softness of their skin just like you do. But he's out to destroy it. I mean, this man is crazy. One thing I would say that you guys have in common is that you can look at the same woman and still get an erection. - Then we better find this guy fast, right? - I should think so. I gave my number to the other two cops that asked me the same questions. You can give me a call. I don't charge for cops. - Well, how thoughtful. You can go down this, right? - Thank you. - Hey, Johnny. - Fuck you. - Fucking cocksucker. (door squeaks) - Hi, Johnny. - What do you want me to do? - What do you mean what I want? I came to see you. - Yeah, well, maybe I'm sick of you coming up here to see me. Maybe it brings back bad memories. Maybe it reminds me of things I don't wanna think about. - You miss mom, I understand. - Oh, don't give me that goody two shoes crap. I don't give a about that bitch anymore. - You don't know what you're saying, Johnny. - You don't miss her anymore than I do. - Yes, I do, I loved her. - It made you sick watching her come home, drugged up all the time with those lowlife John's. Having no much money because she spent it on drugs. - I'm leaving. - Every time you come here, every time you sit free chicken ass in that chair, and then you walk outta here clearing your conscience for the day, it hits me. I'm in prison for killing mom, and you're not. - Hands off the grade. - I can't stand the guilt. It's controlling me. It's running me, it's taking me over. - What do you mean it's taking you over? - Every time I think about that night, my mom was beating me, all I remember is passing out. I wish I could remember taking the knife and stabbing her. I'm sorry the police didn't believe you, when you told them what happened. - No one's sorrier than me, pal. But then the police and I never had a good relationship. - I gotta go, Johnny. I wish I could help. - You could do something if you really wanted to. You could get me out of here. - How? - No, it's too much for anyone to ask. - No, just say it out, I'll do it. (Johnny laughs) (water sloshing) (dramatic music) (camera shuttering) (dramatic music) - Next up is Allyn. Allyn with a Y. Hello, Allyn. - [Allyn] Hi, Vanessa. - Ah, you're a woman. - [Allyn] You better believe it. But right now, I'm a woman with a little problem. - Tell me about it. - [Allyn] My husband travels a lot. - Ah, I think I've heard this one before. - [Allyn] Maybe not. My friend, Joni, her husband travels a lot too. And we're usually left alone for long periods of time. We both think a lot about going out and cheating. - [Vanessa] I take it that idea doesn't appeal to you. - [Allyn] Well, yes and no. - [Vanessa] It can't be yes and no, Allyn. - Well, a part of me would really like to. - [Vanessa] Which part is that? - You know, but another part of me thinks it might be just as good, maybe better if Joni and I, well, took care of one another when our husbands were gone. I mean, I guess it wouldn't be like, I don't know, cheating, I guess. - I guess it all depends on your definition of cheating, but at least, it's safe. There are a lot of crazy people out there, you know? - [Allyn] Tell me about it. There's enough crazy people just in the single bars. Not that I've been in one lately. - Of course not. You're not single. - [Allyn] Either are most of the men in the bars. - Let's forget about men for a minute. What about Joni? Is it just the idea of being with another woman that makes you feel uncomfortable? - Maybe a little. - Let me tell you about something that happened to me. - All right, I'm gonna hang up and we'll listen to you on the radio, okay? - Whatever's comfortable. It was my first year in college, and I gotten paired up with this absolutely gorgeous, sexy roommate. One night, we were sitting around drinking a little wine, bitching about how horny we were. And Gail, that was her name, Gail. Gail said, "Screw it. We don't need men. We know better than anyone else, what makes a woman feel good." To watch her feel everything that you've felt, to make it happen. That's what it's all about. Go for it, Allyn. - Jesus, that was something. I didn't know you went both ways. - You still don't know. - Well, that was no performance. I mean, you've definitely done some love diving. You've probably had more women than I have. - I don't know about that, but at least mine have never asked for cash upfront. - Dinner and movie, cash. What's the difference? - I don't know, balls. (dramatic music) (car engine roars) - Hi, there. What would you like it to be? (indistinct) What an incredible coincidence. My name is Vanessa. Well, this is quite some place you've got here. So, got another chair. Music lover. You want me to dance for you? - Just do everything she says on the tape. - [Vanessa] This guy sounds pretty simple, Sherry. - Sherry, I thought it was Vanessa. (man shushes) - [Vanessa] I can tell from talking to you that you're usually in charge. - [Sherry] Yeah, I guess. - [Vanessa] Well, in this case, it's not working, is it? - [Sherry] Not very well. - [Vanessa] Then try something different. Do the unexpected. Give him the power. All men really want the same thing. They want you to tell them and show them that they are the source of all heat and light. It's all about power. Sometimes your draw a thin, dangerous line to really excite a man and please him. - [Sherry] I just wanna do what makes him happy and get him off. - [Vanessa] Okay, let me lay it out for you. I don't care where you wanna do it. The living room's fine, the bedroom, the kitchen's good for a change. - You wanna go in the kitchen? - [Vanessa] Then leave the room, and take off all your clothes. - [Sherry] Everybody always says that some clothes are more sexy than-- - [Vanessa] Forget what everyone says. This will be different. When you're naked, crawl into the room on your hands and knees and sit in the corner of the room. - [Female] What was that? I couldn't hear her. - Fucking shit, she said, "Crawl into the room and sit in the corner." - [Vanessa] You didn't respond to that, Sherry. - I'm not real comfortable with that. - [Vanessa] It's not supposed to be comfortable. That's what makes it sexy. - [Sherry] Okay. - [Vanessa] Remember, keep looking at him. If he moves towards you, growl like a dog, he'll understand. As soon as he understands, start crawling toward him slowly. If he moves towards you, back off. Take off his shoes and socks. Kiss his toes, lick them. You want him to know what you have in mind and never take your eyes off his. - [Sherry] Okay. I hate to say that this is starting to make me hot. (bright upbeat music) (bright upbeat music) (Vanessa exhaling) (camera shutters) (dramatic music) (car engine roars) - Stay with us. We'll be right back after these messages with a call from Rick. Thanks, Peter, for filling in. You're doing a good job. - No problem. - I wish I knew where Mitch was. He's never been this late before. I'm getting worried. - Well, it could be car trouble. - He could have called. - Well then again, it could be the traffic. - How much time have we got. - Time? I don't know. - Well, let me know when the cart runs out. Sorry for that little bit of dead air there. We're flying with one wing tonight. Our engineer is out in the ozone somewhere. Hey, Mitch, if you can hear me, get your cute buns in here. We need your help, but special thanks to Peter Perkins who's filling in. And Mitch, if you can hear me, I hope you're having some real good feelings out there. And now, we've got a call from Rick. Rick. Hello. - [Rick] Hi, Vanessa. - What's going on Rick? - [Rick] We've talked before. I'm in love with this woman. I don't know exactly how to tell her. - Why do you men make these things so complicated? Why don't you just go up to her and say, "Shirley," or whatever her name is. "Shirley, I love you baby, and I wanna do you." Easy, right? Right? - [Rick] I love you, Vanessa. - It's me. I apologize you caught me off guard. Have we met? - [Rick] You're wearing a white see through top and blue jeans. - What? - [Rick] I said you're wearing a white see through top and blue jeans. Yeah, and you've got red polish on. - How do you know that? - [Rick] You went to see your friend Diane last night. You got home about three o'clock. You wear a pink obsession perfume. You drive a red convertible. You just had me all changed. - Who are you? - [Rick] Keep your panties in the top left of your wardrobe. - Sorry about that folks. I've had some fans before, but I think Rick border's on fanatic. Well, let's shake that and go with a call from Candice. Hi, Candice. - Looking for a date. - [Man] Oh yeah. - What do you have in mind? - [Man] Just something straight of my place. - Your place? I don't know. - [Man] Yeah, look, I'll give you 100 bucks. - Look, all right, but no funny stuff. 'Cause if I even smell a kink, I'm gonna cut your dick off, take it home and feed it to my Doberman. - [Man] Nothing kink. - All right. - [Candice] My husband's making me nuts, Vanessa. - How's that? - [Candice] Whenever we make love, he's on me in and out before I can even smile about it. - Ah, husband express service. - [Candice] Don't get me wrong, he's a great guy and he really turns me on a lot. I know he'd like to do better. He just can't seem to slow down. - Well, it sounds like he's got all the right urges. All he needs is a little control. Let me give you some pointers. Is your husband with you now? - [Candice] Yes. - What's his name? - [Candice] He doesn't really want me to say. - Okay, well then we'll call him Bob. - [Candice] Okay. - Do you have the radio on? - [Candice] Yes, we can both hear you. - Good. Then hang up the phone, and let me walk you through this real slow. - [Candice] Okay, thank you, Vanessa. - Okay, Candice and Bob, we're gonna take this step by step, real slow. You should both stand facing one another, one, maybe two feet apart. Now, I want you to both undress slowly, one item at a time. - So you want something to drink? - Yeah. - No? (man laughs) (gentle music) How about some OJ Gatorade or diet soda? - Don't you have any beer or anything? - [Man] I don't drink. - Just give me a diet soda then. - All right. Here's your diet soda. No, I really wish you wouldn't smoke in here. I said I wish you wouldn't smoke in here. Put out the cigarette. I don't smoke. - Look, just tell me what you want, okay? - I want you to (indistinct) No. I just wanna watch you play with yourself. - You're not gonna touch me or anything? - Nope, what you gotta do is sit the feet off. - Cool. - [Vanessa] Bob, watch her hands. Watch them as they unbutton her blouse. Imagine that they're unwrapping a present that is just for you. And Candice, I want you to watch Bob with just as much interest as he undresses. Take your time. Enjoy looking at one another. Now, approach each other slowly. Do not touch, but go so close that Candice's breasts are almost touching your chest, Bob. Notice that when Candice breathes, her nipples gently press against your skin. But don't reach for her yet. Just look at her, look into her eyes. Let her see how much you want her. And Candice, let him see how much you to take you, and be in you. (gentle music) - Do you want me to take all my clothes off? Take your clothes off. - [Vanessa] Run your hands up and down Bob's chest lightly, fingernails at first, then fingertips. And then you do the same to her, Bob. Explore her body, starting with her breasts, then moving down and you can kiss her, Bob. Kiss her lips, then her shoulders and her neck. (gentle music) - Close your eyes, please. (gentle music) - Is there anything I can do to help? - Just close your eyes and do what I told you. What are you doing? - Look, I don't give a hell about this. I need to go out there and make a living, okay? - Hey, I just paid you 100 bucks. - 100 bucks, I'm not gonna spend the damn weekend. - Damn it. Hey, I paid you 100 bucks, man. You do what I tell you, bitch! (Vanessa screams) - Get over me! Help, somebody help! (gentle music) - [Vanessa] Hang on to that man, Candice, I think he's gonna work out just fine. Call us in a few weeks, okay? We'll be right back. Mitch, where the hell have you been? - Vanessa, I'm sorry. I partied a little too hardy last night. I slept through my alarm. - [Vanessa] You could have called. - Yeah, but I just thought I'd haul ass over here as squish as I could. - What's the blood on your shirt? - I must have cut myself shaving. I was in kind of a hurry, Vanessa, in five, four, three, two-- - Please stay with us. We'll be right back after this news update with more "Midnight Confessions." - Vanessa, these policemen would like to talk to you. - Police, send them in. - Go ahead. - Ms. Scott, I'm Detective Harris, and this is my partner, Detective Sawyer. We've been investigating a series of murders. We have some information that leads us to believe that perhaps the perpetrator might be a regular listener of your program, maybe even a fan. - Detective, I've encouraged people to do a lot of things, but never murder. - Well, I'm sure you haven't, but, well, what we were wondering is, have you been receiving any strange calls, any potentially violent calls? - Not really. There is this one called Rick that calls a lot, but I don't think he's violent. He's just devoted, in love. But he does know an awful lot about me, which worries me a little, but I don't think he's violent. He may even be a friend. - Look, do you have certain callers that may have obsessions with prostitutes? - I'm sure, but none had talk about it that I can recall. - How about your engineer? Does he see hookers? - Mitch, of course not. Mitch is a healthy young guy. He has no reason to consider hookers. I'm sorry, I can't help you guys. - Well, thanks for your trouble. And by the way, if you're hear of anything unusual, just give us a call. - Vanessa, we're missing a cart here. I'm gonna have to go to the other studios, and try to locate it. - Okay, how much time have we got? - 15 seconds. You got two calls waiting and I'll be back in about five minutes to screen the third one. - Okay, no problem. - In five, four, three, two-- - Welcome back to "Midnight Confessions." And next caller up is Rick. Hi, Rick. Rick, you're not giving me the silent treatment, are you? - [Rick] I love you. - You love me, huh? - [Rick] Of course. I love the way you talk, the way you walk, the way you sleep at night. - How do you know how I sleep? - [Rick] I can see you. - Can you see me now? - [Rick] Of course not. - All right, let's stop fooling around here, Rick. Who are you? And how come I never see you if you're always watching me? - [Rick] I love you. I just watch in order to protect you. - I don't need you to protect me. - [Rick] I have to. Woman like you can attract danger. You need me to stay safe. - Stop it. Next up is Dan. - [Dan] I listen to you every night. - That's terrific, Dan. - [Dan] And I have to tell you that you are a filthy, fucking bitch. You are a (indistinct) - Sorry about that, folks. I don't know how much of that got past the delay, but it wasn't very pleasant. Some people don't like the idea of our show, and they feel the need to express it to us. Now, feels like a good time for a break. We'll be right back. - [Mitch] You a little uptight tonight, what's going on? - [Vanessa] Nothing. - Don't be ridiculous. Your neck's like a piece of steel. What's bothering you? - I don't want any more calls from that Rick guy. - Okay. - And how come you're never there when he calls? - What? - Every time he calls, you're gone somewhere. - This guy really is behaving weird. - I don't know, it's this whole thing, the police, the slasher thing, and Rick, and stop rubbing my neck. We've gotta get back on the air. Hi, welcome back to "Midnight Confessions." Next, we've got Danielle. Hi, Danielle. (dramatic music) (camera shutters) (bright upbeat music) (camera shutters) Detective Harris, please. Detective Harris, this is Vanessa Scott from the radio. Hi, listen, I have some ideas about that slasher. I've got this one caller who-- - Ms. Scott, I wouldn't worry. We have a suspect in custody who matches the description. Picked him up a couple of hours ago. His MO is fairly similar, in fact, we found a couple of knives in his apartment. - I'm so glad. It's just that this one caller is so obsessed. - Frankly, Ms. Scott, with the type of show you do, I'm not surprised. You're a lovely woman. Look, don't worry, relax. This caller gets outta hand, you give us a call, we'll look into it. - I guess it was just my imagination running wild. Okay, thanks. - Thank you. Sawyer. - So, how's our mutual friend, Vanessa? - She's not your friend. - I talk to her all the time, every night, in fact. - Just leave her alone. - Why are you so protective of her, Mitch? You know what she is? You work with her. You hear her. You know what she is. - She's a very beautiful woman, very special person. - She's a whore just like mom. - No. - Look how she dresses in those short, tight outfits, just like mom did. - [Mitch] Mom was different, she was-- - I think you should kill her. - What? - I think you should kill Vanessa just like you did mom, just like you did those other whores. - What do you, what do you-- - Oh, I know it's you that's been killing the hookers. Can't prove it but I know it's you. - You're insane, I haven't heard anyone. - She's laughing at you, you know. Vanessa, I mean, just like mom did and her whore friends. I can't believe you stand there and take it. - You nuts, she treats me fine. - Oh yeah, it may seem like that, but inside, she's pissing all over you. - I've heard enough of this shit, and I am leaving, and I'm never coming back. - You know, no one would blame you. Hold it against you if you were forced to kill her. Everybody knows she's a whore. Shit, the cops probably wouldn't even arrest you. They didn't arrest you when you killed mom. - I gotta go, Johnny. I need some time to think things over. - You do that. Oh, and by the way, call me Rick. (dramatic music) (car engine roars) - Let me tell you something, pal, you and all your right wing, pseudo-Nazi, black leather, wannabe, bullhead bigot buddies, have got your head so far up your butts. You could eat the same corn you had last night again. Well, bon appétit. - [Man] Yeah. Well, yeah, yeah, you're just like every other left wing pansy, fairy ass bleeding heart. - Oh, give me a break, will ya? Let's take another call. Hello, you're on the air. - Can you kill the monitor on that, please? - [Man] Sure, it's all yours, and two and 45. - I'm afraid-- - I'm sorry. - I was wrong. - I wish. - You start. - Okay, I shouldn't assume that I could just go in there the other night start rubbing your shoulders. I mean, it was very presumptuous of me. - Don't be ridiculous. We've worked together for a long time. Ordinarily, I would've appreciated it. In fact, I-- - Well, it won't happen again, I promise. - No, don't promise. I like neck rubs. I like you. I was just really stressed out the other night. Don't let it discourage you, please. - Oh, I'll try not to let it. - Would you like to go for a drink after work tonight? - Well, it's a little tough to find a drink at 2:00 am. - Not at my place. - Okay, sounds great. He's going to news, Vanessa. - Okay, that does it for me, Mitch. Have a good shift. - Yeah, have a goodnight. - Your callers give me a headache. - Oh, and yours make my dick hard. - Thank you. Good evening, and welcome to "Midnight Confessions." This is your host, Vanessa Scott. If it's about love, sex, I know it, I understand it, and I love it. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. I see the board is already lit up, so we're gonna wait to give you the phone number. Our first call tonight is from Natalie. Hi, Natalie. How are you? (phone ringing) - What's wrong? - Report came back from the lab. - We don't have the knife. - Basically, plans of mice in there. - I think we still got our man. - Look, I got somebody I want you to talk to. Come on. I want you to tell Detective Sawyer what you told me. - You got a guy named Warren in custody, and you guys think you got the slasher, right? Wrong. - [Sawyer] What do you mean? - He's been a regular of mine for years. He's a freak, okay? But he's a harmless kind of freak. - Yeah, well, for a harmless kind of freak, he sure beat up that woman pretty bad. - I'm not saying he's a sane, gentle guy, but I've been with him 50, maybe 60 times. It's always exactly the same. - Same, how? - He waxes weenie while he watches me finger. - And that's it. - He pays a lot of money for it. And the reason he pays is it takes him for fucking ever to get off. I can tell you exactly what happened with that bitch, Renee, and I say that from experience. I've known her for a long time. The young ones are greedy and impatient. She tried to rush him and he snapped. She was gonna walk out on him, after he paid her more than she's worth, a lot more. And he snapped. - Our slasher likes the same kind of action. Warren could still be our man. - Hold on this more, go ahead, finish it. - The night that one girl, Britt, was killed, I was with Warren all night, all night. He picked me up right at sunset and he didn't get off till six in the morning. He sat there in his dirty little room, pulling on that tiny little dick of his. - For nine hours. - Listen, it was no barrel of laughs for me. I fell asleep twice, and I couldn't work the next day. Even Warren had to admit it was a little tough, but he tipped me 100. - The girl was killed sometime around 3:00 am. - Shit. - All right, that's all for now. - You're shy, aren't you? - Yeah, okay. - You're real shy. That's why you're always going with hookers. I know who you are. I know you're Rick. - That's crazy, I'm not Rick. - I know you are. - You're wrong. - I am? Tell me you're not madly in love with me. Come on, tell me. - I'm not Rick, but I am madly in love with you. - Why didn't you ever say anything? - You're my boss. I didn't know what would happen. - It wouldn't have been a problem. I've been staring at your cute little behind ever since you walked in the door. I noticed it fun a couple of times too. I like what I see. I wanna make love to you. Do you wanna make love to me? (gentle music) (phone ringing) (indistinct) (phone ringing) (gentle music) I'm gonna go take a shower. You make some coffee. (dramatic music) - [Rick] Vanessa, it's Rick. Pick up the phone. I haven't called you at home before because I didn't wanna bother you. But this is really important. I know who this slasher is, and you know who it's too. You've gotta be very careful. It's-- (water pattering) (dramatic music) - Well, you were right. Vanessa was a whore, but you lied about the nobody caring part. - Yeah, I did. - You're always lying to me. Lying, lying, liar, liar, liar, pants on, fire. - We've checked out of sanity, Mitch. - I confronted all those whores, Johnny, just like mother. - Just like mother, but you didn't kill mom, I did. I took that knife and I shoved it so far inside of her and then I blamed it on you, you fricking nutcase. Can you actually believe that I felt guilty for just a moment? Was I wrong? You belong here, Mitch. You belong in this hellhole. - I didn't kill mother. - No, but you've killed all those other women. - I didn't kill mother? - Relax, my psychopathic brother. You've more than made up for. - But there's so many other whores that needs to be converted. - Jesus Christ's mom really screwed you up. I guess, I didn't help though. Well, goodbye, Mitch. We won't be seeing each other again. Sorry about your life. - My mother will be coming. She's a whore. (Johnny laughs) She's just a whore. Fucking faggot, I will kill her! (indistinct) (gentle music)
