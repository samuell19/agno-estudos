In prison, people often ask, how you ended up here. After answering the same question over and over, ﻿your memory becomes hazy. They say it's a process of forgetting. ﻿That once you're out you'll forget it all. And you can start again. ﻿Hello? Still at the shop? I've already got the tickets. ﻿I'm not waiting if you're late. ﻿The first number is 25. ﻿The fifth number is 19. ﻿MISSING ﻿Excuse me, I'd like to file a criminal case. ﻿What's it about? My husband's been missing for days now. ﻿That would be missing persons. ﻿Fill out the form. ﻿Any news? ﻿Not yet. ﻿Hello? Hello? ﻿Hello? ﻿Is that you, Liang? ﻿It's your lucky day! ﻿We provide free air con maintenance... ﻿I don't need it! ﻿It's him. ﻿Honey, is dinner ready? ﻿Mom, where's my white shirt? ﻿Hi, I'm here to fix the air con. ﻿Just a second. Hello? ﻿Yes, speaking. ﻿The air con's in the living room. ﻿Hang on. I'll write it down. ﻿Xin. ﻿It's spelled... ﻿X-l-N. ﻿...restaurant. Okay. Xin ﻿Restaurant. Thank you! Wipe your shoes. ﻿What's wrong with it? ﻿It turns on, but there's no cold air. ﻿Did you find him? ﻿I did. ﻿The sixth number is 23. ﻿The extra number is 8. ﻿Now, let's repeat the lucky numbers. 14, 19, 23, 25, 29... ﻿Get him! ﻿Неу, Fatty! ﻿Where are you going? ﻿Is it ready? Yes. ﻿Who the hell are you? ﻿Are you 18 yet? Think you're all grown p? Smoking at your age? - That'll show you. - Leave him alone! ﻿Give me one. And lighter. ﻿I want to turn myself in. ﻿You want to do what? ﻿I want to turn myself in. ﻿What did you do? I hit someone with my car. ﻿Please hold. ﻿Where's that person now? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Do you know, who you hit? ﻿Xiao Qin, come here for a sec. ﻿Wait here. ﻿What's got into you lately? ﻿You don't even go to work. I'm looking for someone. Who? I don't know. ﻿I have something that belongs to him. ﻿I just want to give it back. ﻿You must be hiding something. ﻿Are you hiding something from me? No. ﻿You missed the movie. And didn't apologize. Typical. ﻿Who knows what's going on in your head. ﻿I'm off. ﻿Mrs Liang? Mrs Liang? ﻿Have some watermelon. - My treat. - I'll pay. ﻿Give me a quarter. ﻿Any updates on Mr Liang? ﻿Think I'll brave it. Take care! ﻿PROFESSIONAL AIR CON REPAIRS Hello, I'm the air con repairman. ﻿It was me who ran your husband over. ﻿I'm sorry. Hi, I'm the air con repairman. ﻿I ran over your husband. ﻿I'm sorry. Hello. I'm the air con repairman. ﻿I'm the air con repairman. ﻿I ran over your husband. ﻿I'm sorry. I ran over your husband. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Did you find him? I did. Huifang! ﻿What a time to be mopping the floor! We are from the Residents Committee. ﻿That's very kind! ﻿We've come to see how you're doing. ﻿Sisters! Let's sit in the living room. So sorry for your loss. ﻿Let me get you some water. ﻿I'll get you some water. ﻿We can manage. ﻿It's so hot in here! The air con's broken and there's no fan. ﻿Come on, everyone! Let's bring some chairs in here. Please, take a seat! Sisters! We've all heard the sad news. Lord, Huifang's husband left all too suddenly. ﻿She is distraught. And devastated. ﻿The police asked me why, why ﻿I acted like I did by going to her home. ﻿I have no idea why. ﻿Strange thing is... ﻿she didn't look that sad. ﻿As if she expected it to happen. ﻿Don't keep it all inside. ﻿Cry as much as you like. ﻿I can't cry. ﻿I just can't. Look after yourself. Make sure you eat. Thank you! ﻿How much will it cost? ﻿Don't worry. ﻿I'm almost finished. Free of charge. ﻿Even you are taking pity on me. ﻿It's not that. It's okay, really. ﻿I just have too much time now. ﻿When they were around I had to cook, do the laundry... ﻿Barely had any time to myself. ﻿And now... ﻿I don't know what to do with myself. ﻿Can I have a cigarette? Lighter. Liang used to smoke three packs a day. ﻿But he wouldn't let me smoke. ﻿She said so many things that day. ﻿Things she could only tell strangers. ﻿Things she'd never tell her friends. ﻿I wanted to tell her. ﻿But I held back every time. ﻿What on earth am I doing? ﻿Have you eaten, Mrs Liang? Not yet. If you're ever bored, feel free to come over. ﻿Are you okay? ﻿I'm fine. ﻿Told you, her husband as up to no good. ﻿See how it ended? I just saw two suspicious-looking men standing outside her door. ﻿Said they were looking for her. ﻿Stop being so nasty. ﻿She's had a tough enough time as it is. ﻿Nasty? ﻿It's not as if I'm shouting it out in public. All fixed. - ﻿Mrs Liang? - Yes? Your husband owes us 50,000 bucks. ﻿Do you prefer to transfer the money or...? ﻿I don't have any money. No money? ﻿Let's see if there's anything valuable in there. ﻿You can pay us in kind. ﻿I don't have anything of value! ﻿Hey you! ﻿This is all I have, take it for now. ﻿Get into fights a lot, don't you? There's a scar on your nose. ﻿Car crash. ﻿Why don't you stay for dinner? ﻿I don't cook much for myself. ﻿If it's the two of us I can cook something nice. He always shows up when there's food. Dig in. ﻿Not great, eh? ﻿It's good. You're a nice man but... ﻿Why the long face? ﻿Something bothering you? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Get out. You should leave. ﻿Are you lonesome tonight? ﻿Do you miss me tonight? ﻿Are you sorry we drifted apart? Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day I can never fall asleep at night. ﻿I walk around aimlessly. I don't know when the cops will find me. ﻿I think I'm actually waiting for them. Who the hell are you? ﻿The fifth number is nineteen. ﻿The second number is fourteen. ﻿The third number is twenty-nine. ﻿The fourth number is thirty-five. ﻿The fifth number is nineteen. ﻿Prison is the same every day. ﻿Even the nightmares... ﻿don't change much. ﻿The Feng Shui is great here. ﻿Who would this be for? ﻿I need two plots. ﻿One for my husband and one for me. ﻿How about these two? ﻿They're cool in summer, warm in winter. ﻿And sheltered from the wind and rain. ﻿Anything available in Zone Two? - You mean here? - Yes. I'm sorry. There's only one left here. ﻿Put my name on it, ﻿so I can be buried with my son. We'll find something else for my husband. How did your son die? ﻿He had heart problems from a young age. But... the doctor said... he could've been saved. I was away that day. ﻿Не managed to get up... ﻿and call his dad. ﻿The ambulance took too long? ﻿No. Liang was drunk. He didn't answer the call. The morning Liang left, ﻿we got into a fight. ﻿The last thing I said to him was: ﻿"You might as well drop dead for all I care." ﻿"I won't be here when you come back." But I waited for him all night. ﻿Maybe, if I hadn't said that, ﻿he'd still be alive. Let's go. ﻿If the person... who ran over your husband, apologized, ﻿would you forgive him? ﻿No. ﻿What good would that do anyway? How did you know he was run over? ﻿Because it was me who did it. My ﻿husband was shot with a gun. ﻿Не had two bullet holes in his body. I've stashed the money away. We'll split it when the job's done. ﻿We'll steal what we can. ﻿And use force if necessary. ﻿Earlier this morning, Zengcheng Police Bureau was informed, ﻿that a male body was found by the river Zengjiang. A police investigation is now underway. This is a popular leisure destination, ﻿where both old and young can enjoy tranquility and relaxation. But this morning's discovery will likely change everything. Detective Chen! Can you tell us about the crime scene? Our investigation is well underway. The police are taking this very seriously. Before Liang's death, that dancer from the northeast was looking for him, ﻿claiming he was going to kill him. ﻿Now everyone knows Liang had a large sum of money. Freeze! What did you want from Liang? Well... ﻿I just wanted to buy a cheap car. ﻿I heard this was the place to get one. ﻿I finally found him. ﻿Не said it was tax-free and cheap. You planned to kill him, right? Nothing like that... ﻿So how come we found a dozen machetes in your room? The machetes? ﻿We'd come all the way to Guangzhou. ﻿So we wanted to buy some souvenirs. ﻿But there wasn't much choice. So we bought the machetes. Call yourself a man? ﻿You stab people over an insult? ﻿They can insult me, but not my family! Think you're special, eh? ﻿You won't talk? ﻿Mrs Liang, have a seat. ﻿What did you quarrel over? ﻿Something silly. ﻿Very silly. ﻿I forget. ﻿Do you know what kind of company your husband kept? ﻿A month ago he mentioned, ﻿he was going on a long trip with some big boss. ﻿Do you know this big boss? ﻿I rarely asked that kind of thing. ﻿Не never told me details. ﻿So you haven't seen him, since you quarelled that morning? No. ﻿You two ﻿don't get along, do you? ﻿Stop standing around like an idiot. ﻿There's work to do! We're closing soon. But you can order here. ﻿Was it you, who called Mrs Liang the other day? Lee, here's another one looking for someone. ﻿Have you met the missing man? ﻿I thought he was dead. ﻿A bunch of fuckwits came that night. ﻿They took off when the power went out. ﻿I lost hundreds of bucks. ﻿Was he alone? Or with someone else? How would I know? ﻿Care for a song? ﻿Only five bucks a tune. The person you're looking for, ﻿asked me to sing a song once. He sat right where you're sitting now. There was a blackout that night ﻿It was hot. ﻿The people were feeling the heat. When it's hot peopIe get edgy. But those two carried on talking about some money. One of them refused to pay the other. Then the man said the money was in a locker at the train station. ﻿Не dared him to check the lockers, one by one. ﻿They didn’t say anything else after that. ﻿A bit later, a person got up and left. ﻿Another followed with a gun in his hand. Are you really blind? I'm blind... ﻿and not blind. ﻿That same song then. ﻿Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight? Are you sorry we drifted apart? ﻿Does your memory stray, То a brighter summer day, ﻿When I kissed you ﻿And called you sweetheart? ﻿Do the chairs in your parlor Seem empty and bare? Do you gaze at your doorstep ﻿And picture me there? Is your heart filled with pain, ﻿Shall I come back again. ﻿Tell me, dear, ﻿Are you lonesome tonight? ﻿SOUTH RAILWAY STATION Train 049 will arrive shortly. ﻿Keep an eye on your luggage. Keep moving. ﻿Watch your children and the elderly. ﻿No spitting! ﻿No relieving yourself in the station. Hey! ﻿Come here. I'm talking to you. ﻿Yes, you! You've finally showed up. ﻿Think you can avoid paying the late collection fee? ﻿Are you Liang Mo? ﻿Locker 19. You're Liang Mo, right? ﻿You're two weeks overdue. I'm keeping your deposit. Pay me another 180, ﻿then take your stuff. ﻿That much? ﻿No spitting. ﻿No relieving yourself in the station. Be civil. Walk in an orderly fashion. ﻿No spitting. ﻿No relieving yourself in the station. ﻿Be civil. ﻿Walk in an orderly fashion. ﻿No spitting. ﻿No relieving yourself in the station. ﻿Be civil. ﻿Walk in an orderly fashion. What's all this? ﻿What's your problem? ﻿Hands off my car or I'll kill you. ﻿Drunken idiot! Don't move! ﻿Take a look. ﻿Can't see the license plate clearly. ﻿There are cars like this everywhere. ﻿It was parked there for just a short time. Is tomorrow morning's meeting still on? ﻿Of course. The chiefs coming too. ﻿Hope I don't sleep through it. It's so late now. ﻿Drunken idiot! ﻿Call an ambulance, quick! Let's go! ﻿Lieutenant Liu here. ﻿Reporting a carjacking and attemped murder. ﻿Suspect's fleeing towards Nanshan. Requesting backup. ﻿Don't move! Liu, ﻿you go that way. ﻿See anything? ﻿No. ﻿Keep up the chase. This way. ﻿Grab some food while you can. ﻿This shipment has to be in Hong Kong by Friday. GUNS FOR SALE ﻿Here to buy pineapples? Yeah. Got the cash? Here. Take a bite! Here's a US 1639 knock-off. Robbery or murder. Revenge. All covered. ﻿It's for self-defence. ﻿Let's go. ﻿This way. ﻿This eight-barrel bad boy's my own invention. ﻿Fires eight rounds in one shot. ﻿You don't even need to aim. I'll pass. ﻿People shouldn't feel ashamed ﻿of the dark side of their humanity. ﻿They should instead reflect on how they dare not face the truth, ﻿when presented with the facts. ﻿The evolution of human society is, on some level, a process of our false sense of dignity ﻿being constantly peeled away. ﻿Darwin's theory of evolution ﻿revealed the intrinsic links between humans and animals. ﻿Whereas Freud uncovered that beneath our rationality ﻿lie powerful natural impulses and desires. ﻿I'm looking for someone. ﻿Does Wang Xueming live here? ﻿Upstairs. ﻿Where's your rent? ﻿I gave it to your daughter already. ﻿Are you lonesome tonight? ﻿Do you miss me tonight? ﻿Are you sorry we drifted apart? ﻿Does your memory stray? ﻿То a brighter summer day. ﻿Stop! I heard the whole thing. Two dark figures were shouting outside. ﻿One asking for his money. The other saying he didn't have any. ﻿Не wouldn't give him the money. ﻿So it was just about money? Yeah, money. One was on the ground. ﻿The other was smashing his head with something. ﻿With what? ﻿A brick? No, not a brick. A club or something. ﻿He told you to call the police? That's right. ﻿saw a gun on the ground. ﻿A handgun. ﻿So I picked it up and shot into the air. ﻿Both suspects are now in police custody. ﻿You don't have to cover for him. ﻿Let us know if you remember anything. ﻿Is this the right place? Yes. Are you sure? ﻿Yes. ﻿I told them I buried the money under a palm tree. ﻿But some drunkard must have passed by and taken the money. ﻿Wang Xueming is being released today. ﻿Thanks for letting me know. ﻿At the time, I just felt like letting go. ﻿Not because I particularly wanted to die. ﻿But because I didn't have anything to live for. ﻿And then... ﻿When I stepped into the water, ﻿a stone flew in from behind. ﻿But when I looked back there was no one there. ﻿Could it have been Wang Xueming? I don't know. ﻿It's ironic, wouldn't you say? ﻿The same man who ran over my husband, might also be the one who saved my life. ﻿Did they catch the murderer? He was sentenced to execution by a firing squad. And Wang Xueming? ﻿Не should be out soon. ﻿So I heard. ﻿Let me take you ou to dinner. ﻿We can continue our chat. ﻿You never told me what happened to the money. ﻿Next time. ﻿I've already bought my dinner. ﻿Coming next week? ﻿I will if you are. I could keep you company? I only bought dinner for one. Thought you were afraid of eating alone. Not anymore. ﻿See you next week. Bye! ﻿Please sign this. ﻿Bottom left hand corner. Here are your personal belongings. ﻿I don't need them. ﻿Take them anyway. Anyone picking you up? ﻿Do you know which bus to take? Yeah. ﻿Your allowance and work remuneration. ﻿Here's your release certificate. You need to apply for a new ID and residence card. ﻿Thanks, Officer. Thanks to a tip, the police raided and shut down a den of illegal arms dealers. After Xueming's arrest, Huifang handed over the money to police.
