Did you forget church? I haven't finished making the stew, yet. Come on girl, get dressed! We'll be late. Mm, I don't suppose you'd care to go without me, just this once? As long as your back living in my house, you won't miss church. Now scoot! Luke, how's that cow doin' now? She'll be all right yet. ADAM: How was town last night? About the same as always. A little church-going might help reduce the swelling of your head some. It certainly cleanses the soul a lot. It's kind of you to offer. ADAM: I'll see ya later. [dog barking] That's a boy, stay. Stay. [honk] [honking] Haven't ya got a dress on a little longer for church-going? LUCY: No. I'll drive, Gramps. No you won't. Get in. Please, Gramps? No, I said. Get in.

LUCY: Thank you. MAN: I just hope they stop by my place. I got a couple of barrels-- MAN: What do ya think about those killers, Adam? What about 'em? If anybody in this county can strap 'em up, I'd say Tom would do it, wouldn't you? Lucy, Adam. Hello there, Burt. Bag of wheat. Adam! I, uh, been meaning to drop over and talk to ya. We can't sit back and let them city folks legislate against us. That don't do nobody any good. Farmers got to stick together, make themselves heard. Uh, you remember, Lucy? Why, Lucy. My you're looking fine. LUCY: Thanks, Mr. Conway. I was just telling your grandfather here that he's got to start coming to Grange meetings again. Ah, it ain't no use. Why, there's no place for the small farmer anymore, Burt. That's why we got to stand together, Adam. ADAM: Well? That's why we got to keep the Grange going. You and I know, Burt, that all that Grange amounts to is a bunch of dang fools that don't know when they're licked. The government's got 'em beat. Lucy, will you please talk some sense into this old bear and make sure he comes to the next meeting? LUCY: I'll try Mr. Conway. Bye, bye. Bye. [siren] [brakes squealing] [police radio chatter] That's the car, all right, Tom. OFFICER (ON RADIO): Thanks, Harvey. Harvey? DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): Central, here. Suspect car on Highway 35, about two miles east of Locust Hill. Alert highway patrol. I'm going on a 10-7. You read me? DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): I read.

ACKERMAN: Here DINELLI: God damn road block. ACKERMAN: There's a dirt road back there. [tires squealing] Hold it. Cut the motor. [sigh] DINELLI: Well, I guess they didn't see us. You big timers sure spook easy. You know what I would have done, Dinelli? ACKERMAN: Nobody gives a shit what you would have done. You've done enough already! DINELLI: Hey, hey, hey! Knock it off. Ooh, ha, ha, ha. Is that a road up there? DINELLI: It looks like it used to be. ACKERMAN: Turn in and go as far as you can. Maybe It'll come out somewhere beyond that road block. [laughing] [clunking] [laughing] DINELLI: What the hell is that? ACKERMAN: Well, what do you think? [sigh] Ah, we can't get across that. Awe, Christ! Now what? Take the stuff out of the car, I'll dump it in the trees. ACKERMAN: Yeah, OK. DINELLI: We'll have to walk from here. Uh, what the hell are you doing, Dinelli? Shut up. You crazy or something? Hey, Dinelli, hey what the hell are You doing? DINELLI: We're doing it my way. We need wheels. How we gonna get back to the city? Wheels, wheels. Who needs wheels? We gotta get past that road block. LEROY: Stupid bastard! Hey give me a hand. Come on. Shit. TOM: Poor kids. What did they want to do that for? Killers. That simple. I'll call Pembroke. - We'll get into town. - Right. OK, come on, you drive. I want to call in. Car 47 reporting. Come in, dispatcher. DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): Come in, car 47. We have here a double homicide on Highway 35, Tri-County area. Two locals killed. [sirens] LUCY: Everybody's talking about that bank robbery. ADAM: If you could listen to something decent on that radio, we'd a heard it before we got to church. LUCY: Police say they may be heading this way. ADAM: Oh. LUCY: They killed two bank tellers. I got to pick up a couple of bags of that new fertilizer. JOHN: Oh, good morning, Adam. - Good morning, John. EDDIE: That's fixed it, Mr Edwards. Thanks, Eddie. I'll stop by tomorrow and check it again. Good morning, Mr. Smith. ADAM: Hi. Well, John, how's the back? Oh, same as ever. Bob said you were stopping by today. EDDIE: Hey, Lucy! Hey, Eddie! Hey, when did ya get back? Day before yesterday. But-- here, let me put this in the car. OK. - How did it go? - OK. Two A's, two B's, and a C. You? EDDIE: Nowhere, I failed French and Math. My old man freaked out when he heard and got me a kind of job. You work on Sunday's too? Or do you just like traveling around showing off your swell Batman utility belt? No, I just work emergencies every other weekend. Mm. You look really nice, Lucy. Thanks. So do you. I missed ya. But ya never bothered to write. EDDIE: You know me. I don't like to start anything I can't finish. There's such a thing as write now and play later, you know. I'll write ya the next time. OK? Yeah, OK. TOM: Morning, Adam. Morning, Tom. See Lucy's back. Yeah, uh, day before yesterday. We found Timmy Peterson on the county highway, shot dead. Jenny Logan, too. Oh, we-- we, uh-- well, we passed them on the way to church this morning. He-- he was changing a tire. Hm. Yeah. He had the baldest set of tires I ever saw. We found that boy less than six miles from your place. DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): -- Suspect car heading south on 6th. TOM: Maybe the killers drove off and we'll catch 'em at one of the road blocks. Maybe they're wandering around in the bush. DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): Come in, Hiram. But you keep your eyes open, will you, Adam? Call in if you see something. [police radio chatter] [sniff] ADAM: Lucy! LUCY: I'll be there in a minute, Gramps. When can I see ya? Anytime. Listen, I gotta go. Hey. Don't forget to call. Poor, Eddie, working all summer-- all year, if he doesn't get better grades next summer. Well, it won't hurt him, none. I hear he's a little shiftless as it is. Oh, Gramps, he's not shiftless. ADAM: I was doing a man's work at the age of 13. LUCY: But Eddie doesn't have to work. ADAM: Aha! But hard work is a virtue. LUCY: Well, education is a virtue, too. ADAM: Ah! LEROY: Where the hell, are we going, Dinelli? Save your breath and keep walking. We'd have been better off in the city. There's millions of places to hide in this city. We haven't any choice anymore. This whole area is probably blocked off. We're in this mess because you had to be a big man and knock off those two tellers. Yeah? Somebody had to fucking waste them. You didn't have the balls for it. Oh, it would give me a real pleasure to lose you out here, so don't push too hard. Get off my back, Ackerman. You know how long it's gonna take to find them bodies out there, huh? [smack] Watch him! Ugh! Next time I'll kill you, you little punk. Fuck off, Ackerman. DINELLI: Now, no more trouble. LEROY: Bastard. Here, let's go. Sooner or later we'll hit a farm. Hey. What did I tell you? Let's go. RADIO ANNOUNCER: Here's a news bulletin. It's been confirmed that the three bank robbers are in the Tri-County area. Oh! What's wrong, Gramps? Wrong? Nothing's wrong. Why? Well, I don't know. Ever since I came home you've been-- well, sort of, grouchy. Well, I'm fine. Well, then why haven't you been going to the Grange? You never used to miss a Grange meeting any more than you do church. Ah, there ain't no sense in going to the Grange. The land just don't pay any more. It's all any of us can do to just get by. All the farmer's troubles end up around some local politician who's afraid to make any demands on any higher politician who's also afraid to step on somebody else's toes for fear they won't get re-elected! Ha! And so we suffer. I tell ya, this country's going to damnation. Nothing else but, going to damnation. [truck approaching] There's a truck! Give me the glasses. [sigh] It's a guy and a girl. She's going in the house. ACKERMAN: Let's see. The guy is just going in. [sigh] I gotta cut the phone wire. Hey, there's a pole over there. Where? Over there. Stay behind the hill so they can't see you. Well, why the hell I always get the shit job? Do it! Here. If that crazy bastard fouls up this job, I'll blow his brains out. All he has to do is cut the wire. Hungry? ADAM: Yeah. I'll be about ten minutes. Right. [grunt] What's this? Cooking with a book? You make it sound like it's a crime. Well, it is a crime. You're not doing for yourself. You're taking the easy way. Awe, come on. Grandma used to swap recipes with everyone in town. Yeah, that's cause they were made up by your grandma, that's why. Not copied out of no book. Well, what difference does it make? It's just easier having all the recipes in a book than on scraps of paper. Yeah. That's what's wrong with this world today, everybody keeps making things easier so nobody has to lift a finger. Ha! Ah. What's wrong, Gramps? Well, there's nothing wrong. Nothing wrong. 'Cept, uh, I do want to tell ya how nice it is to have you back, Lucy. You remind me a lot of your ma. Your Grandma Emmy and me, we never could figure out why she ran off the way she did. Not a word to either one of us, just-- [sigh] Maybe her dying was the best thing could have happened. You shouldn't say that. Dying is good for some folks, if life ain't worth living. I'll be in the barn. [lid clanging] [mooing] Whoa, Princess girl. [mooing] There. [mooing] She got trouble, all right. I'll call the vet. [wire snapping] [radio playing] Lucy, turn that thing down a little. What? Turn down the radio a little, will ya? I gotta call the vet. Is the cow still having trouble? Yeah. [radio playing] LUCY: Is the vet coming? Uh, y--y--yeah. Well, I got a few minutes, so I'm gonna go see the cow. Well, there's nothing you can, uh-- Lucy! RADIO ANNOUNCER: This is Tri-County radio bringing you music and news from the Tri-County area. More news on those bank robbers. Police confirm discovery of a double homicide on Highway 35 east of Locust Hill. At the scene of the killings was the car, reportedly a green Buick sedan, the car the bank robbers made their getaway in from the city. The motive for the double murder is still unknown, but believed to have been concerned with a car theft. The victims have been identified as Jennifer Logan and Timothy Petersen, both of Locust Hill. Citizens are warned to be on the lookout for three men dressed in business suits. They are armed and dangerous. Yesterday, two of the men masquerading as business businessmen entered the city bank and shot and killed two tellers. The police are now convinced that they have them sealed off in the Tri-County area and are closing the net. So folks, on this happy Sunday-- [gun clicking] [mooing] She's fading, Miss Lucy. [mooing] Can't we do something for her, Luke? The vet will help, maybe. I tell you a secret if you promise nothing to say to Adam. I promise. You are a welcomed better cook than he is ever going to be. Thanks, Luke. You better get washed up for dinner now. Dinner will ready in about five minutes, Gramps. Uh-huh. [chickens clucking] Hey, ah, Peter! [barking] Oh, Luke, the phone's out of order. I can't get the vet. She's still got time. Yeah. Uh, Luke, you listen to me good, huh? [mooing] I-- I want you to tie up the dogs, and I want you to stay here until I call for you. You understand? Good. Now you stay. [dog whining] LUCY: Gramps! In a minute! What the hell's keeping him? He's only been gone a few minutes. Get off his back, Morey. We got enough trouble. Yeah, and who's to blame, huh? Ung. Well, I hope you cut the right one. Hey, Ackerman, jerk off. [water running] LUCY: Where's Luke? Uh, he's not coming. LUCY: How come? Well, he's doing something. He'll-- he'll take his dinner later. LUCY: Oh. Ah, I forgot the bread. What's he doing? Uh, he's fixing the harrow. Can't that wait until after-- Oh, Lord, for what we are about to receive, we give thanks. Amen. Amen. Can't the harrow wait until after we've eaten? Need it first thing in the morning. Well, Luke's got to have his dinner some time. He might as well have it now, while it's nice and hot, rather than later. Lucy, why don't you just tend to your cooking and I'll, uh, run the farm, huh? Thank you. You're welcome. Some bread? Yes, please. Thank you. Mm. Tasty. Out of a book. Hm, hm. I expect you'll be seeing a lot of that Powell boy this summer. LUCY: Eddie? Not if he's working. Oh. Weekends, maybe. ADAM: Mm, hm. He was telling me they fixed up the old Pavilion down by the lake. Oh, I, uh, hadn't heard that. You won't mind, will you? Huh? Uh, mind what? If Eddie and I go to the Pavilion. Mm. The Pavilion. I remember when that was first opened. That was before the war. Ooh, what a time that was. Hm! Your grandma and me, she'd made that pink flower dress of her's special. And she was the prettiest thing there. Oh, she was pretty. Hm! I can see her now, just spinning across that shiny new floor, and the moon dancing on the lake right along with her. Oh, she was the prettiest thing. Dance? Oh, ho! Take off your coat. Remember, our car broke down. Here. Load your gun and put it away. And you know, those two was bound and determined to keep up with each other until it meant going home for chores. And they didn't care about chores. And neither were we. Well, we was just dang fools, just watching every little thing they did. Ha, ha, ha. They never would have known we were-- well, we didn't care. In those days, we just didn't care. Ha, ha. Appears like we got company. LUCY: Who is it? Lucy, I think you better go upstairs. [gasp] Gramps, are those the three men that-- ADAM: Could be. They're not local. The phone. It's not working. If you knew it wasn't working, why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to worry ya. I'll go get Luke. No! Do you want us all to get killed? No, no, honey. Look, y-- you just go on upstairs. Go ahead. Come on. Go on upstairs. Everything will be all right. I'll take care of it. Go on upstairs, honey. Gramps, be careful. Gramps! Shh, shh. Please, go on upstairs like I told ya. Go on. DINELLI: Hello, is there anybody home? Hello? Anybody home? [door creaking] Uh, good afternoon, sir. Uh, our car broke down on the road. Is there a mechanic around here someplace? Uh, there's one in town. DINELLI: Do you mind if I use your phone? Well, sure. Uh, come in and help yourself. Thanks. ADAM: Now, the phone's right over there. Hold it! It ain't too often I get a pair of weasels to shoot at this close. Stay inside, Lucy. Luke! Luke, come here. Ugh! Ugh! Gramps? It's all right, Lucy. It's all right. You go on back inside. Go ahead. Everything's fine here. Drop your pants. Drop 'em! Pick him up, Luke. Now march. Bring him, Luke. [flies buzzing] [door creaking] Now you can come to dinner. No. No, thank you. [flies buzzing] You all right, Lucy? - Yeah, Gramps. - Huh? - Yeah. - That a good girl. Woo. What are you going to do? Finish my dinner. It's cold. Oh, don't matter. There! Well, what did you do with them? I covered over the one outside and tied up the other two. We have to get the police. Ha, ha, ha. Well, I'll drive to the Conway's and phone from there. Naw, the phone could be out there, too. Then I'll go into town. Well, there's-- there's time enough. LUCY: What for? ADAM: For you to sit down there and eat the rest of your dinner. LUCY: Oh, Gramps, I can't eat anything, least of all cold stew. Well, warm it up, then. Gramps, the police are looking for them. We can't keep them here. Well, I got every right. Hm, they're trespassing on my land, carrying guns, threatening lives. You're not listening to me. You had a perfect right to do what did. But now that it's done, you have to notify the police. By and by. Now, Lucy, you're-- you're getting yourself all worked up over nothing. It's not nothing, Gramps! For god sakes, why would you want to keep them here a minute longer than you have to, anyway? ADAM: Well, um, I'm cooling 'em off. Well, what does that mean? Lucy, these fellas just didn't drop by to pass the time of day, you know. They'd have killed the three of us and took off in the truck if I haven't been ready for 'em. I'm sick and tired of reading about these-- these hoodlums terrorizing people. I think it's about time that-- that someone taught their kind a lesson. LUCY: Gramps, they're wanted for murder! They'll either hang or go to jail for life! Huh! The way the law is today, they'll probably get 60 days with two months off for good behavior. For god sake's Gramps, you're not the law! No. But, uh, they could learn a lesson or two while they're here. What kind of lesson? I'm thinking on it. Hm. Where you going? To the bathroom! Lucy, you're not worried about them? [sigh] No. But I'm beginning to worry about you. Well now, there's no need. I've always protected mine and my own. And I don't intend to stop now. [door closing] [toilet flushing] Gramps. Now, now, now. I know what you're going to say. Now, don't you worry about a thing. You just play your radio and stop your fretting. Everything's going to be all right. Sure nice of you fellas to drop by. Nothing like spending a Sunday in the country. Ha. Yes, sir. Ha. And nothing like good ole country air. Yes, sir. None of that smog and pollution like you got in the city. Uh-uh. [chuckling] Oh, go ahead. Breathe deep while you got the chance. You fellas got names? Well, it don't matter. Hm, hm. Oh, by the way, those iron rings are what we used to use to chain the bull up there when-- when we didn't want him messing 'round the cows. Ha, ha. Thought you'd appreciate that. [flies buzzing] Which one of you shot Timmy Petersen and his girl? We don't know nobody by that name, you crazy old bastard! Take these god damned chains off us! I figured it was you. You look the type. Pretty little handguns you got here. I-- I used to do a little bit of handgunning myself, you know. Oh, just an old Colt revolver and-- and then, just against bottles and tin cans. Nothing interesting. And nothing fancy like these. Yes, sir. You mind if I try one? Course, uh, I might be a bit off my aim. But, uh, they say that, uh, once you learn something you can't ever forget. [gunshot] [glass breaking] Ha, well, now, that pulls a little bit to the right. Of course, it wouldn't matter too much, though, the way you fellas use them up close. LUCY: Gramps! ADAM: Uh, yes, Lucy? LUCY: I heard a shot. Now, now, now, now. Now, there's nothing to worry about. Everything's fine. Uh, uh, don't you worry now. You go on back to the house. Go on. You hear me? That's a good girl. ADAM: Now, uh, this one might be a little more accurate. Longer barrel, you know. [cocking gun] [truck door creaking] I got the key here, Lucy. You wouldn't take the truck without asking me first, now, would you, Lucy? Gramps, please, let me go get the police. Now, Lucy, I told you not to worry. Stop your fretting and go in and play your music. I don't want to play any damn music! [door slams] [door creaking] [clock ticking] [door opening] Lucy? You wouldn't want me to let 'em go now, would you, Lucy? There comes a time when a man has to do what he thinks is right. Maybe you better stay right up here. I'll tend to things. [locking door] [police radio chatter] Anything new? TOM: Nope. You? Ah, some kid said he saw a green Buick heading north on 6th. Turned out, he didn't know a Buick from a Chevy. DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): Car 51 come in. What's up there? Not much. We were just checking the woods off the highway. Conway farm is in about two miles. Adam Smith's about five. They're here someplace. The way we got it blocked, they can't get out. Just gotta keep looking, that's all. Yep. We'll go east. - See ya. See ya. Come on, I'll spell ya. OK. DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): Yeah, one is 6 feet, dark, dressed in a green business suit. You want to check Conway's and Adam's? Nope. I don't think they're in that far. Let's go this way. DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): All are armed and dangerous. Ballistics identified his gun. He used a .32 caliber. Keep going, straight ahead. Straight ahead. Ho. All right, get down in there. Ho. All right. Come on, get up! Ho. All right, let's go. Ho. All right, go on. Ho. Lucy. Lucy! Get over there! Over here. What's the matter, pop? She split on ya? [laughing] ADAM: Lucy! Lucy! Hold it, right there. Worried, pops? I nearly made it that time, didn't I? Afraid she's going for the fuzz, pop? [laughing] ADAM: Come on, you! Luke! Luke! Luke! [rooster crowing] Come on, man! Come on, Luke. Luke, Lucy is on her way over to the Conway's. Now you take the truck and bring her back. You understand? Bring her back! All right, let's go. [truck door closing] [truck starts] [door opening] [flies buzzing] Are you just gonna leave us here like this? You son of a bitch! Son of a bitch. What is he so hung up on me? Because you're a prick. [flies buzzing] Adam wants you back, Miss Lucy. I'm not going back. - You've got to come. - No, Luke. It's not right. You know it's not right. I've got to go get the police. He's doing what he thinks best. We are lucky. We could have all been killed. But you caught them! LUKE: They get what they deserve. Adam will see to that. He's a good man. LUCY: He's wrong, Luke. You know it's wrong to try and take the law into your hands. If we don't stop him, there'll be another murder! Please, Luke, you gotta let me go. I don't wish have any troubles with Adam, Miss Lucy. It is up to us to stand by him. You come back. - No, Luke. We've gotta do what we think's right. I don't give orders, Miss Lucy. You come back. No. [screams] No! Man, I'd give back half the bread for a glass of water. You know, I don't think that little chick likes what that old dude is doing. For sure. Big deal. I swear, he's dragging me up here, I seen her running down the road. I think she's going to get the fuzz. Yeah, and what are we gonna get? LEROY: We had a chance for a break. We ain't got nothin' now. You know that old man's mental. You see how close he came to fucking blowing my head off? Not close enough. [honking] [door closing] Lucy, I wish you hadn't done that. Don't treat me like a child. Well, I hadn't noticed I was. I can leave when I want. You can't keep me here. Well, sure you can. Sure, I can. Oh, now I know why Ma ran away. [water running] Lucy, are you going to let them killers come between us? Don't you know what you're saying? Well, of course I do. And they ain't worth it. If they ain't worth it, then why in the hell are you doing it? No, there's no need to swear. And I told you. You haven't told me a god damned thing. Now, don't use the Lord's name in vain. Do you call chaining people on the manure pile more righteous than using the Lord's name in vain? And what was that shot? Well, I was just scaring 'em a little. Why? What for? Well, I got my reasons. What possible reason can anyone have for chaining two people on a manure pile and shooting at them? Well, if it makes you feel any better, I-- I got 'em in the cellar and nobody's hurting 'em. What are you waiting for? Grandma to come back from the grave and pickle 'em? [door closing] [clock ticking] [door closing] [door opening] [clock ticking] Need some water, please. [water pouring] More. Crazy old guy is just gonna leave us here to die. Lady, call the cops, please. LUCY: I tried. LEROY: Give us a break. There's nothing I can do. LEROY: Untie our hands. If I did, you couldn't get away. My grandfather would kill ya, or the police would. Anything is better than this. Please, don't leave us here to die. [flies buzzing] Please? [gasp] Don't move! Not yet. ACKERMAN: Crazy bastard, let me loose! Yeah! [punching] Argh! [screams] [screams] [crying] Come on! [moaning] It's all over, pop! Drop it. Let her go. Drop it! Come here, Lucy. You want to see her dead? [click] You didn't think I was gonna leave those guns loaded, did ya? What the fuck are you-- [crying] ADAM: Get up. Get up, now. Now get down there, the same way you came. [grunts] [door closing] You lousy bastard! Ugh! Uh-- uh-- ugh! [knocking] [knocking] What is it? ADAM: I'd like to talk to you for a minute. There's nothing to talk about. Well, I'd like to explain something. All right if I come in? What difference does it make? Lucy, I wasn't going to let nothing happen to ya, honey. Well, Luke and me was right close by. What? I had to prove something to ya. What did you have to prove? That they'd kill as soon as draw breath. Oh, my god, you mean-- you told me they were in the cellar because you knew I'd-- oh, I don't believe it! ADAM: Well, all our talking didn't do no good, so I had to do what I did, cause-- well, they'd have killed you and me as quick as they killed Timmy Petersen and his girl this morning. Timmy? ADAM: Yeah. Jenn? Yeah. Must have done it while we-- [crying] Oh, my god! Lucy? Go away! Leave me alone! Stop it! [sobbing] [door closing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello? EDDIE (ON PHONE): Lucy? Eddie, where are you? I'm just down the road. I came to fix your phone. I tried to call. Your line was out. What's wrong? Oh, please, come and get me! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! [sigh] Oh! What's wrong? What's happened? Please, take me-- go! [mooing] [dog yelps] ADAM: Stay, stay! [mooing] [mooing] [truck starts] [mooing] I figured you fellas have been down here long enough. Now, just don't get any ideas. Just take off your chains and get those things on. DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): Where are you? TOM: About two miles beyond the lake cutoff. DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): Get over to Adam Smith's place fast as you can. Eddie Powell just called in. He says the suspects are at Adam's place. OK, we're on our way. What's happened? DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): I haven't got the whole story, but Eddie picked up Adam's little girl. She was pretty upset, but seems he has things under control. [siren] ADAM: Now, you've been asking me to call the police and turn ya in. That's far enough. Get over. Well, I'm going to do some better than that. I'm going to let one of you drive into town and get them yourselves. The other one can stay here and keep me company. That ain't funny, pop. Wasn't meant to be. Well, now, who goes and who stays? I mean it! Who goes and who stays? I'll go. Like hell, you will. Fuck off, Ackerman. ACKERMAN: Shut up. Fairest way is to toss a coin. You call it. Who's kidding who, here? You're not gonna let nobody drive that truck off alone. Call it. Heads. Uh, uh! All right. Now pick it up. Pick it up. Heads! Hey, you, Ackerman! You bastard, you're gonna screw me. Go on, bug off, you little prick. Now get outta here. Go on. That's enough. Ackerman, you ain't gonna leave me alone with him? Yeah. [laughing] Awe, there's nothing to worry about. Now the keys are in the truck. But-- before you go, I want you to meet a couple of friends of mine, Peter and Paul. [whistling] [barking] Gentleman, Peter and Paul. Named after the good book. That don't necessarily make them gentle, though. Fact is, they don't take too much to strangers. Now go ahead, mister, get in the truck. Oh, you gotta be crazy. Crazy? I'm giving you more chance than you gave Timmy Petersen and his girl. I didn't do it! He did! Oh, he'll get his chance, too. Go on. Go on. [growling] [barking] [screams] [screams] [screams] Peter! Paul! [moaning] [gasp] ADAM: Now it's your turn. Maybe you'll be faster than your friend. No. No. G-- no, no. Give me a cha-- g-- give me a chance. But I am giving you a chance. No. No, y-- you can't do this to me. [sirens] [laughing] [hand cuffs rattling] TOM: Adam. Looks like you took care of everything, Adam. You'll find their suitcase just inside the door. And another dead body under the tarpaulin. Well, maybe you better come in tomorrow and make a statement, though, huh? [laughing] Now everything's gonna be fine. [mooing] [flies buzzing] Phew! [flies buzzing] [vehicle approaching] [door closing] Grandfather, I'll stay in town for a while until I decide what I'm going to do. ADAM: Well, you'll be needing your clothes. What about your radio? Somebody can come back for them later. Hey, thanks, baby. Come on. [door closing] [engine starts] Well, I'd better get that one into town. Take care, Adam. EDDIE: Can I give you a lift anywhere? LUKE: No, thank you. [laughing] [siren] Ugh! Argh! Hey, what's happening? Look out! [gunshot] [gunshot] Get-- oh, geez. You son of a bitch! Aw, give me it, god dammit. [gunshot] [siren fades] [crows calling] How 'bout that, baby? No. Come on out! I told ya I'd be back! I come to get you! You bastard! I come to get you! Come on out! I'm not done, you old bastard! It's hard to get rid of me. All that shit you pulled on me didn't work. I come to get you! [laughing] [gunshot] [music playing]
