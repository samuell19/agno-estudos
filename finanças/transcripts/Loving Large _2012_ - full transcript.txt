(electronic music) - [Voiceover] In an age where thin is in and counting calories has become a national obsession, a counter-culture movement is brewing behind the idea that big can indeed be beautiful. From plus sized beauty pageants. - There are quality women in every single shape and size. - Growing up, I didn't feel pretty enough, so a beauty pageant was the farthest thing from my mind. - [Voiceover] To full figured fashion shows. - We always designed something that is flattering to women. - I never thought I had the body to be a model. I never thought it would happen to me. - Popular culture is trying to establish what's pretty and what's not, what's handsome and what's not. And society's fighting that. - And I love that cookie dough ice cream. (bleep) cooking it, let's just eat the dough. Are you okay, skinny bitch? You haven't had anything to eat today. Please, please, just a half a sandwich, please. I've gotten a lot of letters. It's so nice to see someone embrace their size. There's always this turn towards being proud of being big. Adele, Monique, Melissa McCarthy. - [Voiceover] However, there is a serious health risk to this growing acceptance of size. - I see four year olds with high cholesterol. - [Voiceover] And a larger desire can turn into a dangerous obsession. - They wanna watch a big man eat a big meal. Gives them some sexual pleasure. - [Voiceover] But for many, it's all about the freedom to fully express a bigger love. - Larger women should be appreciated too. They are beautiful. - It is kind of like coming out twice that you like larger people. It's against the norm. - I've never been attracted to skinny men. I like to have something to grab onto. - I have a lot to grab onto, it's fantastic. LOVING LARGE - My name's Latasha Raines. I am 31 years old and I live in Auburn, Washington. I was Miss Plus America, so I have a national title. So many women who were inspired by what I was doing, who were like, it's so nice to see a beauty queen that looks like me. I started the Washington State Plus America Pageant and I'm hoping that what I'm doing here will not go against being smaller, but saying that you still can represent what's important to you and you can be a role model, you can be a leader, regardless of what your size is. - [Voiceover] Four, five, six, seven, eight. - The average woman's size is not this two or zero to six that's being portrayed as what beauty is. There are other pageant systems that project that. The average American woman can't relate. - Danielle Mitchell, Miss Seattle Plus America. My platform is empowering and teaching you through theater. I wanted to show that beauty does not have a dress size attached to it. One of the comments that a lot of plus sized girls get, you have a pretty face. It's like always about our face. It's never about, like, our body. From head to toe, I look great. Just coming to terms with, I'm sexy. I'm a woman, I'm powerful, but I'm plus-sized. (rock music) I was just doing color guard routine cause I started doing it in marching band in high school. Those girls can move and dance and do the thing. - Jennifer Tindell, Miss Pacific Plus America. My platform is treasuring our troops. I decided to attend this pageant as a self-journey. Bringing light to the fact that just because a woman has curve and is plus sized doesn't mean that she doesn't have the commitment and heart to get things done. (electronic music) - Kristin Wood, Miss Bothell Plus America. My platform is eliminating child obesity. I wanted to compete because when I was younger, I always watched the pageants and I was always really excited and enchanted by all of the beautiful clothes and the makeup and just how elegant everyone looked. I did not do other pageants because I did not fit the size criteria. (upbeat music) - Ephesia Williams, Seattle Plus America. My platform is the A21 Campaign for teen girls in human trafficking. There is a picture for beauty, skinny, definitely. I am in this pageant because it's such a good opportunity for me to get just my point across that big is beautiful. - [Voiceover] Big men are also staking claim to a counter-culture movement where XXL is becoming a proud tagline for many clothing companies and customers. Big OI' Boy is an Oklahoma-based company hoping to cash in on the trend. Shane Hale is a model and company spokesman. - There are a lot of people who are getting more comfortable with themselves. They're stepping out of, I have to be a certain size. I should be ashamed of this size. Gives them something to be proud of, to be boisterous of. They tailor the shirt to design for bigger guys so that when you bend over, you don't expose yourself. We've got a line of polos that are out that anyone can wear. I think popular culture is trying to establish what's pretty and what's not, what's handsome and what's not, and society is fighting that. Attraction to the bigger guys is, it's a more inward beauty, it's more genuine, it's a gentleman, because they're not out their trying to dress the best, look the best. I was surprised that I was being chased by the smaller athletic guys. I didn't think that they would be accepting of the big guys. I have a partner, and he met me when I was a big guy. - [Voiceover] Gay culture is where big old boys were not only accepted, but revered, earning nicknames such as bears and chubs, and drawing thousands of admirers or chasers to conventions like this one in Dallas, Texas. 24 year old Michael Walker from San Antonio, Texas, knows exactly what he's looking for. - Yeah, I've always found myself wanting to be friends with the chubbier kid. Alright, well, I'll catch you around. You got my number and everything, so. - Have fun. - You too. - It was probably about junior high when I had my first girlfriend, who happened to be chubbier. It's just who I am, what I'm attracted to. Something about larger guys' chests, it turns me on. It wants me just to be around them. - What's up, man? How've you been? - Good, how are you? It wasn't until junior year of high school that I actually found out that I was gay. Don't be a stranger, okay? You have my number. Being gay is something you're born with. What you're attracted to is something you're born with too, and it has been difficult accepting it over the years, but it is who I am, it is part of me, and you like what you like. It is kind of like coming out twice, because first of all, coming out as a gay man is not easy. Second coming out is just you like larger people. It's against the norm. I've been attracted to men that are over 500 pounds. People like the whole softness factor a lot. People like how big guys are cuddly. They're nice and warm, of course. - We met on a website for chubby guys and thin guys who love them. - He's pretty much exactly the kind of guy I'm into. Smart, handsome, funny. - Make me blush. - We've been together four and a half years. I started to realize, probably around 15 or so, that I was into chubby guys. I thought Santa Clause was hot. - Sometimes he makes me wear the beard. - Able to say, like, what is it. Just so foreign to a lot of people, you know, just to think, to like somebody who's large in general. Some people say they like a little junk in the trunk. That's very different than liking somebody who's just full figured in every aspect. - I weigh over 400 pounds. For some people, the bigness of a chubby man is about strength, and for some people it's about comfort. - I love him just for who he is, and that's what's most important to me. (electronic music) - [Voiceover] A plus sized change is coming to the fashion industry as well. With the average woman now wearing a size 14, there's a growing market for fashion tailored to their needs. Not just any fashion, high end fashion. Since 2010, there's been an annual Full Figured Fashion Week and it's becoming more popular every year. Leading the revolution on and off the runway are fashion designer Adolfo Sanchez and model Jennifer Purviance. Adolfo was well-established in high end fashion with an avant garde style, when he decided to turn his talents to the full figured market, launching his Queen Grace Collection. - I think it's needed. A lot of women in the plus sized community want it. There's a big lack of really tasteful, fashionable pieces in the market. There can be a bit of snobbery in the world of fashion towards the plus sized community. There's a bad stigma that they can't do the same things that they do with plus sized fashion. I think it's actually not true. Once more people start to see that there is ways to do plus sized fashion, the more high fashion feel that it will actually be more accepted. Ever since I got involved with Queen Grace, it really has opened my eyes to a whole other world that I did not know about and a movement that's happening that I think is really great. With Queen Grace, we no longer use the words plus and we no longer use the words full figured. We always design something that is flattering to women. All the fabrics that we work with are all stretch fabrics. Just do some gathering on an area where maybe you wouldn't have to worry about creating too much volume, so we added it down below. Makes everything really fitted and then still gives the design detail. Three quarter sleeves, sleeves are really important. This is our finale evening gown. We created a deep V to make it sexy without actually showing a lot. Inserted like these panels in ways that really does create this hourglass figure. This dress is the Serena. It's from our spring-summer collection. Wanted to do like a modern take on a wrap dress, which is really great for all different types of women and different shapes, and then we accented like a little shoulder detail by adding the pleats and the satin, and then we added some slight detailing and pleating to it so you can actually see that it works really great, has a little bit of volume without actually adding too much. - I love this dress because it flatters my curves. It accentuates my waist and it's a great length and I'm comfortable, so that's really important to me. I never thought I had the body to be a model. I never thought it would happen to me. There are so many girls that dream of being a model. Who knew that it would happen to me? Think of a model walking down the runway and being small and not me. I never even knew what the plus sized world existed of until I stepped my feet into it and it just opened my eyes. - [Voiceover] However, Jen says a controversy is stirring over whether some plus sized models are as full figured as they appear. - I know a lot of models that wear fat suits. They pad up and they go out to castings and they actually get jobs. As a designer, a lot of them do hire women that wear fat suits because it gives like the illusion that you're still... That your collarbone's out and your still really slender but you just happen to have these voluptuous hips and you know, these curves on your body. I wish that everybody would just model for who you are and not wear fat suits, because there's so many girls out there that are beautiful and a size that you're trying to imitate. Why not just hire the model that's that size? - [Voiceover] Jen was discovered in the mall by a representative for Torrid, a store chain specializing in plus sized fashion and accessories. - [Jennifer] I recently did a model search in New York with Tyra Banks and Seventeen Magazine. It's a great way for me to boost my confidence through modeling. I met my husband in the small town where we're from just through mutual friends, and we've been together for seven years. He's in the United States Marine Corps. He got injured in Afghanistan, brain damage. He got hit by a roadside bomb. He's okay; it could've been a lot worse. Did you have fun, Kinsey? - [Kinsey] Yeah. - I liked everything about her, I liked her personality. I mean, she's obviously beautiful. I try not to judge people for what they look like, what everybody thinks that everybody needs to be skinny. She's a role model for younger girls. It's alright to be bigger and be a model. - I know a lot of girls that look down upon myself and other women in the industry because they think that you're just embracing being fat and eating all the food that you want and being so unhealthy and just loving it. That's not what we're saying. We're saying as long as you are healthy and you have a healthy lifestyle, if you're a little curvier and you have some meat on your bones, embrace who you are. Don't go throw up and make yourself into something you're not just because that's cool and that's what you're supposed to be. Even some parents you see on TV are telling their kids you can't be who you are. It's not acceptable. - I don't like going to school cause all the other kids pick on me. It hurts my feelings. - [Voiceover] This public service announcement raised one disturbing fact, the bullying and discrimination suffered by plus sized kids. - I grew up in Bowie, Texas. It's about an hour and a half northwest of Dallas. Population of about 4,000 people. My grandmother, she had one pan in her kitchen and that was a cast iron skillet, so everything was fried. I faced discrimination because I was a big guy. They made fun of you, the size of pants that you wear. You know, they give you wedgies and stuff like that. - I never have been a skinny person. I wore a steady size like 12, 14. I did struggle accepting me. I wanted to shrink, change the way I walked, and I wanted to wear black all the time. It was tough, you don't wanna be around people socially. - I didn't feel beautiful when I was younger. When I was growing up, I was made fun of a lot. - I did see her deal with it, and it was hard. I mean, being a little kid and being different as far as your size, it hurts and it's hard and it hurt me to have to see her deal with that. - I didn't have any other defense mechanism than my size. If you're gonna make fun of my size and I'm bigger than you, then you better be prepared to handle all of this in your face. - Growing up, I didn't feel pretty enough, so a beauty pageant was the farthest thing from my mind. Always seeing all of my friends around me being so skinny, none of them ever getting into a double digit dress, I was pointed at, made fun of. Got so bad that I stopped wanting to go to school. Finally, my mom agreed with me my sophomore year that home schooling would be the best. It really lowered my self-esteem. - I am a freshman in high school. There's a lot of people that make fun of me. They won't talk to you, they usually call me fat. They'll just talk about you behind your back. Kind of made me feel really bad. - Being in an environment where she was being degraded, it really sucked the life out of her. - I learned to, you know, move on. - Since my teenage years, I've always been a larger girl. At the end of high school, I went over 200 pounds to 220. I'd get off the Metro bus on my way to school and people would ask me if I was pregnant, and that was tough to deal with. My self-esteem has always been really low. When I was going through school, I didn't talk to anybody, and I didn't talk to boys especially. - [Voiceover] That all changed when Kristen met Cory while working at a movie theater. - I thought he was attractive when I first saw him, and that was the first thing that I was like, oh, hey. But then the more I talked to him, he was just really funny and I was like, well, we'll see. - I've always been attracted to bigger women, ever since I found out that women were attractive. I've always gravitated towards the more curvy women. I like a voluptuous woman. When you look at a plus sized woman, you make the connection that they're more nurturing and a little more real. - My boyfriend, I met him in high school. He loved me for who I was. - She's gorgeous, her curves, has really nice curves. - Especially the lower curve on my lower half. I'm not gonna say he doesn't like my curves cause obviously, he does, we've been together for over two years. - When she's facing me, it's the silhouette. Larger women should be appreciated too. They are beautiful. She's just full of life and energy. Her personality is just, I dunno, beyond anybody that I've ever met. She's a great person, inside and out. - I just like hugging her and I like holding her and we've been together three years and within the first year, we were expecting our first baby. Right after that, we were expecting our second one, so I have a very strong sex life. Plus every day, I'm so happy to have her in my life. - I have a loving fiancé who, not a day goes by, that he doesn't look at me and he doesn't have to say it, but I can see it in his eyes, how much he loves and cares for me and that I'm beautiful. - My name is Hal Raines. I've been married to Latasha for about a year now. You can see her and tell there's a plethora of things to just enjoy about my wife. I definitely learned my wife's body. I like the curves. I grew up in a family of large women. Didn't have a whole lot of skinny. For me, I like to hold onto something. I'm a big guy, I'm pretty strong. You get excited, you get excited. Sometimes, you might think that a skinnier person's like so fragile, you don't wanna hurt them. - When you go home and you're in bed, you wanna be like, you know, creating fire with your bones rubbing together, but anyway... - I've never been attracted to skinny men. I like to have something to grab onto. I don't want that to sound... - I have a lot to grab onto, it's fantastic. - I do face discrimination for liking larger women. When we go out, people tend to stare and look, but I think it's because of the difference in size. - Well, it doesn't hurt me, babe. That's what you say to them. I feel that it's hurt him more in our relationship than it has me, and that's the only thing I feel bad about, is that me being a plus sized, hurts him and there's nothing I can do to stop that. He just has to know that I know he thinks I'm beautiful and I don't care what other people think. - She reassures me emotionally. It shouldn't bother us what people's opinions are. - There is a line between what guys say they want and then what they actually want. There's a lot of pressure to accept the normal ideal of beauty. - I definitely say men, if you see a woman that you like, whatever size she is, don't worry about what your friends think, don't worry about anybody thinks, you know what. You'd be missing out on the best woman of your life. - Where do the magazines get off thinking that you have to have models that are super small? I don't see guys wanting that. (electronic music) - When you see something that you're supposedly aspiring to be like, and it's getting smaller, the hope that you could possibly achieve that also becomes smaller. I'm never gonna get there, I'm never gonna look like that woman, so why try? Instead of maintaining a healthier, fuller figure, they might let themselves go all the way. There's so many celebrities that became famous and amazing, and then you have people running after them to get them to lose weight, and then all of a sudden, now they're a better singer and now they're better because they've lost weight. That's what's pounding in, subliminally, into these women's heads. Not until recently, until I actually was introduced to pageantry, that I fully was like, whether I lose weight or I gain weight, I'm okay where I'm at. - [Voiceover] However, health is an important point of caution in this growing acceptance of plus sized beauty. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 42 percent of American adults will be obese by 2030, up from 36% today. Doctor Rami Awad specializes in weight reduction surgery and hosts an obesity run and exercise camp in Palm Springs, California. - We know that obesity is strongly correlated with type two diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, infertility. There's a strong link between obesity and almost every type of cancer. - [Voiceover] Children are among the hardest hit. - Mom, why am I fat? - [Voiceover] This public service announcement in Georgia did raise one alarming statistic. Dr. Malina Jampolis has made nutrition and medical weight loss her specialty. - 30 percent of kids born in the year 2005 are going to be diabetic as a result of obesity. I see four year olds with high cholesterol in my office now. - [Voiceover] A lot of the blame is placed on all the processed food available today, and people's desire to eat quickly and cheaply. - Foods are now formulated for maximum eating satisfaction. Intense flavor, multiple levels of flavor, high fat, sugar and salt act like drugs in our brain. Trigger these addiction pathways, very similar to sex addiction, drug addiction, alcohol addiction. People can't stop. - I gained about 50 pounds during my sixth grade year due to my father having a massive stroke. The stress of not knowing what the outcome of his illness was gonna be, food was a comfort zone. Ice cream calmed you, calmed all of us as kids. I would love to lose 60 to 80 pounds; I weigh 280. I've already cut a lot of my sodas out. It's back to chicken, constantly walking. - I try to eat the vegetables and I try to eat a lot of fish. - We did blood tests for the first time and I had high cholesterol. I was up to 285 and I've lost 52 pounds now. I feel a lot better about myself. I have a lot more energy. I'm just a lot happier with my body in general. My cholesterol and everything is also really good now, so that plays a role in it too. - This is my before and after shot. This is a kilt that's a size 48, and I'm selling it for half price. It's half of me, so... I lost weight because doctors told me diabetes runs in my family. I was becoming, had a higher risk for it. I just started paying attention to what I was eating. Don't eat a large pizza when you come home from the bar at night. After losing the weight, I feel amazing, both physically and mentally. - A guy will, you know, wanna date you and then they'll wanna take you out for a big meal. They wanna watch a big man eat a big meal. It somehow gives them some sexual pleasure. If someone looks at me and says, oh, you'd look so much better at 500 pounds. You'd look so much better at 600 pounds, they don't want me, they want a pillow. To be in that sort of relationship with someone who's trying to make you get bigger and bigger and bigger, then they're infantilizing you, then they're putting you in danger physically. - I know chasers that say I like guys 500 pounds, only 500 and up, I will date. Well, if you ask them, what about the health? Oh, I don't care. What if they die? I'll find another boyfriend. My attraction has gone down from the 500 range to 300-ish range cause I've also realized health does play a role. If I wanna date a guy, I want him around for a long time. - I love him as he is right now. He's very, very physically attractive to me. I wanna be there with him and I wanna be with him for a long time, so we're gonna do whatever it means to be together for a long time. He doesn't need to lose a whole bunch of weight. - I feel fantastic, I definitely know that I need to be much lighter. - [Voiceover] Despite their best intentions, Americans are losing their battle with the bulge in a big way, even with the help of a $55 billion a year diet industry. The Centers for Disease Control say most dieters will gain back the weight. - If somebody wants to lose weight, they have to commit to a new lifestyle. More physical activity, less fast food and more whole food. Being constantly bombarded by unattainable, unrealistic images, is making it more difficult for us to lose weight because it's setting us up for failure. - [Voiceover] It also raises the question, what is a healthy weight? - People feel like they have to get back into their jeans from high school or they haven't been successful, and that's just not the reality. If this entire country could focus on losing 10% of their body weight, that would probably do more than penicillin has done for the health of our country, and you can be fit and larger. - I went through testing to see if I was at risk for heart disease, and you know, we went through everything and it was crazy cause they were like you are pretty much the healthiest fat person I've ever seen. - It's funny when I go to the doctor because they're like, you're actually really healthy. I'm like, yeah, I know, I'm a pretty healthy fat chick. No, I have no issues. I have a goal, I wanna be a size 16. That's like two sizes away from where I am now. I'm like a size 20, 22. - The idea that you can be overweight and beautiful and take care of yourself and look good and feel empowered and feel in control, but if you're obese, I'm not so sure that that's the right message to be sending. - [Voiceover] For some people, weight loss is a matter of life and death. Many are turning to gastric bypass surgery for help in overcoming years of bad eating habits. - The stomach is restricted, and you reroute the intestines in such a way that not all the intestines see food. So if the intestines are not seeing food, they're not absorbing food. You eat less, you're not as hungry, you're not thinking about food constantly. - [Voiceover] After each reaching a weight of more than 300 pounds, Victoria and her husband, Israel, decided that gastric bypass surgery was their last chance. - [Voiceover] One day, you just wake up and you're just like, how did I gain all this weight? - [Voiceover] You don't realize it. You stop looking in the mirror. You just go buy clothes that are bigger. I never owned a scale. - [Voiceover] You're eating larger meals. Super size it, super size it, super size it. - You get so caught up in the weight gain that you don't wanna exercise. Three weeks after surgery, I had lost 55 pounds. Over the next six or eight months, I was losing three to five pounds a week. I've lost a total of 150 pounds. I weigh 143 now. - Now I'm 183. I was diabetic, type two diabetes. Sleep apnea, high blood pressure. I was taking medication for all those and as of like a week after the surgery, like that quick, it was gone, and now I feel healthy, energetic. I feel like I'm in my 20's. My appetite is pretty much non-existent after the surgery that you have to remember to eat. - Now if I overeat, I don't feel good anymore. I feel gross; I don't wanna overeat. - [Israel] And it makes you wanna get up and go do something after you eat. Not like before, when I was heavier. I'd eat and then I'd be in a food coma. - Being able to cross your legs is huge. Being able to, when you're going through an aisle in a grocery store and there's another person with a cart, get around them. We always had a good sex life. That was always good for us. He's always liked thicker girls, bigger girls. He even said, a couple weeks ago, I thought you were the sexiest when you were about a size 16. And I'm all, that's about 40 pounds heavier than I am now. And he's like, that's when you were your sexiest to me. What are you trying to say to me? - I've always been attracted to a thicker girl. Maybe it's a mother thing, I dunno. But the most important thing to me is personality and kindness and heart, and she has so much of it that throughout all our weight loss, there's never been a point where I've been, oh, wow, like, I'm not attracted to her. Now, she feels better about herself, so you feel sexier. Now I'm kinda radiating a little bit more self-esteem and feeling better myself. Since we've lost the weight, we've also noticed we get treated a lot differently. People smile a lot more now. - Nobody'd ever hold the door for me. They'd walk in front of me into a store and the door would close in my face. Now, they hold the door. Somebody I was dealing with at work or a customer, now they make eye contact and they engage in conversation. I could walk around with a piece of chocolate cake in my hand and nobody would probably even make a second glance at it, but if it was when I was heavier, I would've got stares all day long. Well, should you be eating that? - [Voiceover] Actress and comedian Jen Kober comes down on each side of the weight divide. - And I love that cookie dough ice cream, not just because it's so tasty, y'all, but because I know it was invented by a fat woman. Yes, only a fat girl would say (bleep) cooking it. Let's just eat the dough. Are you okay, skinny bitch? Are you taking this all in? You alright? Cause you can't stop me right now. You haven't had anything to eat today, have you? Please, please, just a half a sandwich, please. I had a skinny girl come up to me and she's like, that's not fair of you to make fun of me cause I'm skinny. Fat women are jealous at the ease of which skinny women go through life. - [Voiceover] However, Jen's been riding a wave of plus sized acceptance in Hollywood, padding her resume with roles in the American Pie: Reunion movie, HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Treme. - I don't want the fat people to feel left out. We also have stickers that say, "Hard to kidnap." I've gotten a lot of letters. It's so nice to see someone embrace their size and I'm a hard to kidnap kid too. Whether you're big or you're small, I feel like you have to just appreciate the person and I think that it's nice that that's finally happening. I feel like I've gotten cast in a lot of roles that maybe they didn't see a bigger person playing, but because I can do the work. There's also this turn towards being proud of being big. Adele, she makes no apologies about her size. Monique, who's such a talent. She'll tell you, I'm big, that's the way I do it. Melissa McCarthy, she's just a delightful person. When you see bigger women that own their size, that's very attractive. - [Voiceover] Danielle hopes to be part of a new generation of full figured women making it big in show business after competing in the Washington Plus America Beauty Pageant. - I've been cast as the big, black funny woman and I feel that that's something that also need to be changed. I should be a part of this positive change for plus sized actresses not being just a funny sidekick. - [Voiceover] Beauty pageants may seem like a lot of fun, but they are serious business to Latasha Raines. - We are gonna be elegant, we are gonna be classy. We are gonna be (indistinct). We're aware of our bodies. So these side conversations look better. Some of them feel like I'm a little tough, and I am. Just as tough as society has been on women of size and basically silently saying you are not accepted. You know, you are not the vision of beauty. Bend your knees, arms, okay? So like, I don't want that or you know, like that, cause that's what I see. You don't want to flip your hair up. We want you to still look elegant. Don't hide the fact that you're in a cocktail dress and heels on a stage that is elevated. There can be that mindset of that's so cute. Those big people are getting together and they're gonna make themselves feel good, and not taking it seriously, like maybe they would a mainstream pageant. I don't want my contestants to go through that. It is tough and it is the lack of understanding. Wow, I am blown away, you guys are phenomenal and you're smiling and you're poised, so beautiful. - [Voiceover] More than 45 women took to the stage in the first Washington Plus America Beauty Pageant. The contestants aim to show that big can indeed be beautiful. Washington Plus America Teen (upbeat music) - I was shocked and excited and proud of myself. It wasn't just people I know, making decision, and they were looking at me, at more of an all-around person rather than just my looks. I hope that the pageant will show other girls who may not be plus sized that we too are people and we have feelings and we can make a difference just like them, and we don' have to be pushed aside. - Seeing other women like me and getting to know them better, through them, my self-esteem is boosted. I've had so many people tell me that I'm completely different than what I was pre-pageant, pre meeting all these beautiful women. - Size really doesn't mean anything. When it comes to beauty and confidence, anyone can have it. I already signed up for the next pageant, next year, so more pageants, more fun, more appearances. - I did for a long time and like cared about what other people thought of me and like, really wanted to be like everybody else. And I was like, what's the point of that? Why do I need to be like somebody else? Like, I'm just gonna do me. - [Voiceover] Danielle is also determined to send a bigger message in this counter-culture movement of plus sized beauty and acceptance. - I'm not saying skinny women are not as beautiful as plus sized women. Women are beautiful, period. The media needs to get it right. - I know for a fact since I've started modeling, I've made a lot of women comfortable in their own skin and shown them that they can love who they are. My hope is to see plus sized high end fashion keep going in the industry, just embracing everybody's natural body type. - In a really short period of time, we have really gained a lot of recognition, a lot of growth and it's been going fantastic. It shouldn't be a section where you have to go and shop if you're a certain size. I think it should all just be blended together. - You wanna have the ripped abs, work at it. If you wanna be a husky guy, be a husky guy. It's all about what you want as a person. You shouldn't let society dictate how big you wanna be. - These women went in kind of like, oh, I don't know if I can do this, I've never walked in heels, I don't wear dresses, I don't like to show my arms. You know, all these things that we're told to hide because we're bigger, to wow, I just got a cute dress on. I'm wearing heels, I'm ready to do this. When's the pageant gonna start? You know, totally different attitude. Seeing these women transform, so many of them have said, even if I don't win the crown, I've won so much. I actually wanna go out and do things where before, I was just sitting at home, commiserating over what I look like. And now, I can actually say, okay, I'm gonna make the best of what I got and if I don't like it, I'm gonna change it. LOVING LARGE
