An ordinary house with wooden walls. But the flooring is of clay. It's the first day of monsoon... and look at the heavy rain, mother. Such heavy rain that everything got drenched... along with me. See, how drenched I am. I went to see the birds coming from the south for breeding. And see, I've come drenched. Where are my clothes, mother? I might catch a cold in these wet clothes. Why don't you speak mother? The clothes are in the bathroom. You already kept it there. You knew I'd get drenched. And I knew you'd worry about me. But mother. I don't regret getting drenched. Had I not get drenched, I'd have missed seeing the beauty... Dark clouds had gathered in the sky. I knew it'll rain. Still I kept on walking down the hill. First it started with wind flowing and then it started raining. Let me change and then I'll talk to you. It was an amazing experience, mother. Tender and delicate... light weight and colourful. I wanted that panorama to permanently settle in my eyes. Even my body is wet. Imagine how drenched my clothes would be. Oh... The touch of heat after the coolness of water. Where shall I put these drenched clothes? Shall I keep it here? I could touch it and see. I could gulp it. Then I realised what it is that transforms... the emotions into poem. For the first time I could understand... why someone gets lost in the picturesque beauty of... clouds touching the mountain peaks. Why someone gets mesmerized... by the swiftly forming images in the sky. What's the matter, mother? Why are you silent? Can't you see I'm working? You always say that I stay at home and disturb your work. And sometimes you ask me why I'm serious. Milk is hot, add sugar and have it. No, you tell me first. Now go and rest for a while. I still... - No, mother. I don't want to relax. I'm not tired. I still experience the raindrops falling on me. My goose-bumps happen. Why don't you tell me? I won't talk to you if you do this. Who are these people? Perhaps, the royal servants. What are they doing here? - I don't know. They are seen here a few times in a year. Whenever they're seen around, something... untoward definitely happens. Sometimes they come to announce war. And sometimes an outbreak of disease. I had seen them here... when your father died in the outbreak of disease last time. But why have they come here today? Mother! You didn't tell me. Agnimitra has returned today. What do you mean? From where? From the place I had sent him. You had sent him. But I had told you he need not be sent anywhere. You know I don't want to get married. Then why do you make efforts? You think I'm needlessly crying over? I can see what you say is coming true. Agnimitra has come with a message... that they don't agree in this alliance. They say... - What do they say? And by what right? My life belongs to me. If I want to end it, no one has the right to give any comment. I never say I've any right. I'm not talking about your right. It's not you, I'm talking about. Today, your life belongs to you. I've got no right on you. Why do you say that? Try to understand me. I know, I don't have any right on you. But I can't live with this guilt. I know, exceptions are always there. I can understand your pain. Still I don't feel guilty. Emotionally, I've explained emotions. For me, that relation is bigger than... all the other relations in life. I love my emotions. It's pure, tender and immortal. And I hate for such emotions... pure, tender and immortal. Fact is that like the villagers... you too have doubt and hatred for him. Villagers don't know him much better than me. I hate him. - Mother! Why would villagers have any problems with him? But I do have. My house is about to ruin under his effect. Stop, mother. Why did you leave? Mother's life doesn't run on emotions but karmas. She has many duties to perform. It hurts. Who's hurt by him over here? Like the south, even here? I can see many new faces in the village today. Some royal servants are here. I'll sleep. Yes, if I sleep for some time, I might feel relaxed. But before that I want to have some milk. Mallika! If there's some milk, get me some in a bowl. Mother has kept it warm. I'll check. I just saw a few royal servants passing by. Mother says... whenever they comes... some untoward things happen. I really find it strange after the stunning experience of rain. Mother is very upset today. I'm much happier than before. My pain is reducing day by day. I'm recovering. Wonder how he could shoot arrow at this tender body. He took a leap in my lap. I said I'll take you to a place where you'll get motherly love. Really! Mother is very upset today. She must have guessed I was with you during the rain. Otherwise, I'd never have returned completely drenched. Mother is always worried about the society. Give the milk to me and take it in your arm. I won't drink milk. No... I won't be obstinate. I'll definitely drink milk. Like this... Like this... You want to make it more tender by feeding it milk. As far as I know, we're not familiar. How dare you enter in a stranger's house? Isn't it strange, I wanted to ask the same question to you. We're not familiar at all. Still you picked up the deer cub shot by my arrow? Thank God, I could follow the blood marks on the path. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to follow you... under these dark clouds I can see you're not from this region. I praise your knowledge. My dressing reveals that I'm an outsider. I didn't say that by looking at your dressing. So, do you read my forehead marks... and try to prove that you're not only a thief... but an astrologer too? Don't you feel ashamed of putting this blame? I'm sorry, girl. But the deer he brought home is my hunt. So, I belong to it. Will you return my property? This deer belongs to this mountainous region. And being the resident of the same region we're siblings. It's your mistake to believe that we'll hand it over to you. Mallika! Take it inside and let it rest on the mattress. The mattresses in this house are not meant for all. Mother, can you see? Yes, I can. And that's why I say. The mattresses are meant for humans to sleep... and not the animals. Give it to me, Mallika, my arms will be the best mattress for it. I'll take it to home. And you think this royal man Tantil will let you go? It depends on the Royal man's interest (like). I think I should show you what are my likes and dislikes. Quite possible. Stop, royal man. Don't be adamant for this deer. It must be a question of your right on it. But for him it's a question of his emotions. Though armless, Kalidas will never care about your arms. Kalidas? You mean, the person I was arguing with for that deer... was the poet Kalidas? Yes. Yes. But how do you know that Kalidas is a poet? How do I know? Every one from the royal court of Ujjayini... knows poet Kalidas's for his creation Rhutusamhar. Everyone knows? Emperor himself read Rhutusamhar and praised it. So, the kingdom of Ujjayini wants to honour and... confer the title of royal poet to the writer of Rhutusamhar. Great Sage Varuchi is here for this. State of Ujjayini wants to honour him. Position of a royal poet? I regret for behaving unmannerly with him. I should apologise to him. Did you hear, mother? State wants to confer him a title of royal poet. I've kept wet clothes for drying. Little milk is left. I've added sugar to it. Didn't you hear the royal man? Drink your milk. And I hope we won't host anymore people... in this house now. - Hospitality?! Today, I want to host the entire world in this house. I wish to make you bathe with this milk. Now, let me get up. I've many chores. No, please, keep sitting. State is going to honour him. He'll get a position of royal poet. I told I've lose the sense of thinking and differentiating. Why, mother? Why you're so prejudiced? Why can't you think about him with an open heart? I've crossed that age of living life ignoring the facts. And now your eyes can only see faults. It does, where there's fault. What fault do you see in him? That man is self-centered. He loves no one but himself. Is it because he is always lost in clouds... ignoring Aryamatul and his cows? I'm not concerned with him and his cows. I'm only thinking of us. Sit down, mother. I want to understand what you mean. I too want you to understand. You say you're emotionally attached with him. What are these emotions? I don't name it. But people do. If you're really emotionally attached with him... then why he doesn't wish to marry you? You've always been grateful to him, mother. You know how he lived his life... with ups and downs of the circumstances. How he lived in Aryamatul's house. How could he think of marriage... in a situation where there was lacking... with no basic facilities in the house? And now when the situation reverses... To save oneself from forming a relation... lacking is a big reason and the same lacking... when fulfilled becomes the big reason for the same. This isn't you but the society speaking. I very well understand such a person. Your relation with him is that you're a medium... by which he loves himself. He can be proud of himself. But aren't you a human being with a heart? Doesn't he have any duty towards you? After my death, if the situation is such... that there's no source of one meal at home... how will you answer to yourself in that situation? Your emotions will satisfy your question. And then you'll say this is the society speaking and not me. My life has been spent till now. And it'll be spent even in the future. Today, when his life is taking a new direction... I don't want to be selfish. Ambika! Today, I'm going to announce in the village... that I'm not concerned with Kalidas. What has happened? I've raised him. I've brought him up. Was it for him to be a poet? But I heard that the state is going to honour him. A great sage has arrived from Ujjayini. That's what I mean to say. A great sage has arrived from Ujjayini. But you said. - That's right. Tomorrow itself, this sage wants to take him to Ujjayini. But... He has 2 chariots and a troupe of soldiers. Didn't I tell you that one of my ancestors took part... in the war by the side of Dhritrashtra? You were talking about escaping. That's what I mean. Try to understand. From one side, we're getting honoured by the state. And this great son refuse to get honoured. He says I'm not made for the royal rewards. He doesn't wish to get the royal honour? I don't understand the reason of his refusal. If you're getting honoured, you should accept it. Otherwise, what's the value of the poems? Poems do have some values, Aryamatul. That's why he's getting honoured. I can understand why he's refusing. I assure you that he'll definitely go to Ujjayini. What do you mean? Are they his servants that... they'll praise him and take him away? After getting an honour, if one refuses it... it adds to his importance. You should be happy that in your lineage... people are also socially expert. If this is called social expertise... then I'd term it a foolish behaviour. Both means the same. If the giver, whether he gives wealth or honour... he can even change his mind. And once he changes his mind, it's over. And just think, the emperor can also get angry... that an ordinary poet didn't accept his reward. Guru, are you here? And sage is waiting for you. And what are you doing here? Didn't I tell you to be with sage until I come? But you also told me to inform you... once he's done with relaxing. Yes, I had told you. But I had also told you something before. You could remember what I told you later. And forgot the earlier instruction? But, guru... What? You think I'm a fool? Tell me. Do you think I'm a fool? No, guru. If not me then surely you are. What did sage say? He said he wants to visit the village with you. The region that gave birth to Kalidas' poems. Kalidas' poem? Wonder what special thing... this great sage noticed in his poem. This man has no idea of social behaviour. And you talk about the strategies? Today he came home with a deer. Fortunately, I saw him outside. And pleaded him that a great sage has arrived... from Ujjayini, so you must not take it inside. And he returned from there. As if something was behind him. Mallika, bring a mat for him. No, I don't want a mat. Sage is waiting for me. I told him to sit with sage... and this foolish fellow came behind me. But I came to give you the news that... And I thank you for giving me this news. You did a great job. Sage is waiting there and you came here with the news. Now do me a favour. Find that poet and bring him home. My duty wants me to present him to the sage. And my heart says I should held his plait and... Father always remains angry. But where's Kalidas? He's in the temple. Did you see him? - Yes. But you didn't tell this to his father. I didn't want him to go there now. Why? Even you don't want Kalidas... I want Kalidas to go to Ujjayini. That's why I didn't find it right that father... would go to him at this time. He's very satisfied listening to himself and... that's why he keeps talking. He never wants to understand the situation. Kalidas is adamant that until the guests that came from... Ujjayini return, he'd stay at the temple and won't go home. What a dilemma? Dilemma? - Yes, of course it's a dilemma. What's the dilemma? State wants to honour the poet. And poet is least interested... and is meditating in the temple. State representative goes to the temple and praises him. Poet slowly opens his eyes. Performing such a big drama. Isn't this a dilemma? Kalidas isn't acting, Ambika. I'm sure he's not interested in royal honour. He really doesn't wish to leave this mountainous region. He doesn't wish... No one's request can make him change his mind. There's only one person. If she requests, there are quite good chances that he'd agree. We're not concerned with any of his decision. Getting emotional, Kalidas is forgetting that... he'd lose a lot by refusing this chance. Eligibility creates ¼ of your personality. Rest is attained by the prestige of your clan. Kalidas must go to the capital. So, what's the obstruction? I've noticed that there's some deep line of bitterness... behind his adamancy. I know where this line is. Some time before he met a royal man. Only you can clear this bitterness, Mallika. Opportunities never wait for anyone. If Kalidas wouldn't go from here... then state won't be at loss. The royal poet's seat will not remain empty. But Kalidas will remain what he's today. A local poet. People who are praising Rhutusanhar today... will forget him after some time. No. He shouldn't refuse this honour. It's the honour of his personality. He can't let his personality be away from this right. Let's go. I'll come with you to the temple. Mallika! - Mother! I should say this in front of an outsider... that I don't agree with your visit to him. I'm not an outsider, Ambika. This is an important moment, mother. I must go. Come, Nikshep. I'm sorry, Ambika. Emotions! The dark clouds have spread untimely darkness, Ambika. Or you've no idea of time. It's surprising that you didn't light the lamp. Vilom, why did you come here? Shall I light the lamp? My visit here isn't surprising. Go away, Vilom. You know that your visit to us... Mallika doesn't like it. I know, Ambika. Mallika is innocent. She doesn't know anything about life and society. She doesn't wish me to come here. Because Kalidas doesn't wish. And why doesn't Kalidas wish so? Because, he sees his desires in my eyes. He gets confused. But you know Ambika. My only shortcoming is that I frankly say what I feel. I don't want to comment about your shortcomings. I can see you're very upset. And when did you live happily? Your entire life was full of pains. You've also reduced a lot. I heard Kalidas is going to Ujjayini? I don't know. He'll be honoured by the state. Kalidas will live in Ujjayini as a royal poet. I think before he leaves, he should marry Mallika. I'm sure you'd have thought over this. I don't want to think anything at this time. You're Mallika's mother. You don't want to think on this? Surprising. I told you to leave Vilom. Kalidas will go to Ujjayini. And Mallika, who's the talk of the town because of him... will stay here alone? Why, Ambika? Why? Did you tolerated all the pains in life for this day? Only a farsighted person can see what you've gone through. Time has broken your mind, body and soul. You've suffered many hardships... so that Mallika wouldn't lack anything. And today, when there's a question of lacking in her entire life... you don't want to think of anything? You're not reducing my sorrows by saying this. I request you to leave me alone. I think it's very important for me to be with you at this time. I've come to say this to her and not to you. I hope he'll come here with Mallika. I've seen Mallika going towards the temple. I want to wait for him over here. You won't have to wait any longer, Vilom. I know where, why and when you're eager to see me. Tell me. Which new notes you're learning today? You can definitely be proud of your knowledge today. I heard you've received an invitation from the capital. I too have heard it. Are you sad to hear that? Sad? Yes, of course. Who wouldn't be sad with the thought of separating from a friend? Will you go at dawn, tomorrow? I don't know. But I know. Great sage wants to return at dawn. I hope you won't forget me with the glory of the capital? I heard people get busy over there. There are many attractions in that life. Dance programs, bar... and many different entertaining things. Vilom, this isn't the time to talk about all this. I didn't expect to see you at this hour. I know you're not happy to see me here. But I came to see Ambika. I didn't see her for many days. I thought let me see if there's anything wrong. It's not wrong to do something. Yes, it can be wrong if you wouldn't do anything. Actually, it's so good that both of us... understand each other so well. No doubt, this isn't my nature... that is hidden from you. What's Vilom? Unsuccessful Kalidas. And Kalidas, successful Vilom. We're very close in that sense. Undoubtedly. We feel everyone is closer to each other. Good that you accept the truth. May I ask you something with the right of being close to you? I want to know, are you still the same Kalidas? I didn't get you. What I mean is that are you the same person... that you were up till yesterday? Vilom, I don't expect such misbehaviour. Misbehaviour?! What misbehaviour is this? My question is very clear. What do you say, Kalidas? Is my question not worthy? What say you, Ambika? I know nothing about this. Nor do I wish to know. Stop, Ambika. Villagers have talked a lot about Kalidas and Mallika. Vilom... - Considering that Isn't it right... for Kalidas to tell us if he wants to go to Ujjayini alone or... Kalidas isn't answerable to you. I know he is not. But possibly Kalidas' conscience will force him to answer. What say you, Kalidas? I'm definitely forced to praise you. You don't only intrude in other's house... but in their lives, too. I'm an intruder? What say you, Ambika? Do you think Kalidas is right? That I intrude in others' lives. Let's go and ask anyone in the village. So, you're not answerable to my question... even by your conscience. Possibly, the question is such. You're free to think as you like. All I know is that I'm not at all interested in going to Ujjayini. Undoubtedly. Why will you be interested? Any ordinary person can be, why will you? But I only wanted to know if this happens... For an instance, let's accept that you decided to go... then is it not right to... - Vilom! You're crossing your limits. I'm not a kid. I can understand what's right and wrong for me. Maybe you're failing to understand... that you're here as an unwanted guest. I didn't think it's necessary to understand this. I know you hate me. But I do not. My presence here explains that. And I also wanted to say one thing to Kalidas. You're close to Kalidas. But I know him more than you. May your journey be safe, Kalidas. You know that I'm your well wisher too. Who would know this better than me? Possible that this unwanted guest may drop in again. Till then, please forgive me. Are you upset again? Look, you've promised me. Think again, Mallika. It's not the question of honour... and accepting the royal position. A bigger question is in front of me right now. And that question is me, right? Sit here. You know me, don't you? You think your refusal to this opportunity and staying back... will make me happy. I know my heart will feel emptiness after you leave. I may also feel the outside world lifeless. Still, I'm not ditching myself. From my heart I suggest you to go. I wish if you could see your eyes. My eyes are teary because you're not understanding me. You can be away from me after you leave. Your talent won't develop over here in this village. People do not understand you. They want to test you on the standard model. You believe that I know you. I know that you'd be surrounded by any line. And I don't want to surround you. That's why I'm telling you to go. You're not getting it completely, Mallika. It's also not about you surrounding me. I can feel that this village is my real land. I'm attached to this land by many means. It includes you, my sky and the monsoon. Every thing here, animals and their cubs. I'll get uprooted if I leave this place. Instead think that the new land will be more fertile... and favourable for your roots to grow. You've obtained from this land everything that you could. Now you need a new land... that would make your personality complete. New land can also make you wither. There's no land without tenderness inside. Your personality will definitely attain that tenderness. Trust me. Even after leaving this place... you won't be completely detached. You'll take away the breeze, clouds and deer along. And I too will not be far away from you. Whenever I want your company... I'd go to the mountain peaks. And get surrounded by the clouds. It's going to rain again. It's already dark now. Great sage will be waiting for you. Mallika! You're not fine, Mallika. Come inside and rest. Let me be here, mother. I'm absolutely fine. Look at the clouds, mother. Tomorrow, these clouds will fly towards Ujjayini. Don't cry, Mallika. I'm not crying, mother. It's not sorrow that are shedding from my eyes... but the happiness. After many years, there's no difference in her illness. How's Ambika now? Same fever. Isn't there any improvement yet? Don't think so. For the past 2 years, she's suffering with the same fever. Actually, Ambika is too worried. She doesn't take the herbs on time. How are you? - Fine. From a long time. No one from the kingdom visited us. Sometimes, I think I should go to Ujjayini and see him. Why? Want to talk a lot. At times I feel guilty. - For what? You know it better. I never imagined Kalidas will get so engrossed in Ujjayini. But I'm happy that he's so busy out there. Over here, he only composed Rhutusanhar. Over there, he has composed many new poems. The officials came 2 years ago... had got me the copies of... Kumar Sambhav and Meghdoot. He said one more poem is praised a lot. But he couldn't obtain its copy. I heard he also created a few plays... which were staged in the theatres of Ujjayini. Still... - Still, what? I feel sorry to talk about but had heard... many other things from those officials. When a man progresses in life, his name automatically... starts getting linked with many other things. I'm not talking about that. We also heard that he has married... the princess of Gupt clan? What's wrong in this? In the sense, it's not wrong. But over here, he was adamant about... not to get married in life. What happened to his decision? He never thought that to keep his adamancy, you... I'm never discussed in his life story. I'm one of the ordinary people. He's extraordinary. He wanted an extraordinary life partner. I heard the princess is very intelligent. - Yes, I've heard it. She's very educated. I told you it's not wrong in the sense. But if you look at it the other way, you feel sad. Instead, I feel guilty... that I could have obstructed his path of progress. In your words, had I not inspired him to go... I'd have committed a grave mistake. This is what makes me feel sorry... that had I not followed my instructions... you wouldn't be in this state of life. What difference have you noticed in my life? Earlier mother used to work. Now she's ill, so I work. That's the only difference visible from the outside. Yes... Let me give the herbs to mother. I'll see you soon. Mother, if you feel cold, I'll close the doors. It seems like a few people have come from the outside again. Who are they? Maybe the royal servants. I've seen two such people in the past... when great sage had come to pick up Kalidas. Such people? Do you know what mother has to say about this? She says whenever these people visit our village... something untoward happens in the village. Sometimes war and sometimes outbreak of disease. But nothing as such happened last time. Are you sure? What had happened? And everything that happened had happened for good. The atmosphere is so damp that the clothes... do not dry for hours. No... But how come no? Why did you suddenly get excited, Nikshep? I saw one more person riding a horse and passing by. So what? Like mother, you too doubt something unusual will happen? It's a familiar face, Mallika. What? I'm sure he's Kalidas. Kalidas? How's it possible? I've seen it myself. He rode on a horse towards the mountain peaks. Maybe everyone failed to identify him in the royal outfits but I can. I'll go and see. Royal servants also must have come with him. He has come and went to the mountain peaks. After many years you've returned today. I thought the day you'll come, that day clouds would have... formed again and it'd be the same dark day... I'll once again get drenched under the rain... and I'll tell you that I've read all your compositions. I've requested so many times to the people going to Ujjayini... to get me copies of your compositions. I thought I'll sing the verses of 'Meghdoot' for you. Bells will chime from the mountain peaks. And I'll give you the notebook made by my hands. And say that this is for your new creation. I've done the binding of these blank pages. Whatever you write on this will make me feel... that I'm somewhere in it. I too have some contribution. But today when you've come... the environment is entirely different. And I fail to understand if it's really you or... I guess I'm in front of Ms. Mallika right now. Tell me. Greetings from the servant of Dev Matrugupt. Dev Matrugupt. Who's he? Creator of Rhutusanhar, Kumar Sambhav, Meghdoot... and Raghuvansh, the learned and renowned royal poet... and the future king of Kashmir, Dev Matrugupt's wife... Mrs. Priyangmanjari wants to see you... and she wants to be here at her earliest. As per the orders, I'm here to inform you beforehand. Kalidas is the creator of Rhutusanhar... Kumar Sambhav and all. And you say... He's going to take charge of the kingdom of Kashmir... on behalf of the Gupt clan. Matrugupt is his new name. He's going to take charge of Kashmir? And... And his wife is coming to see me. I expect you to consider some changes in your house... as the royal person is going to visit here. Taking it as your order, we'll soon complete this job. My respects! I think this seat should be near the door. Madam will enter through the door... and the seat too will be near the door. In that case, we should shift it to the south corner. South corner? I think it should be a little towards north. So that the sunrays would directly fall on it. I don't agree with you. I don't agree with you. So? - Since it has become a debating issue... let the seat remain here. Okay, let it be here. And these pots? I think one pot should be in this corner and another in that. But I think they shouldn't be here at all. Why? I've no answer to it. I don't agree with you. I don't agree with you. So? - So let the pots be here. These clothes? - They're still drenched. So, we shouldn't remove them. Why? - Our scriptures say that. Which scripture? - I don't remember that. But you remember that it is mentioned somewhere. Yes. - So? So, it's a question of doubt. - Yes, it is. In that case, the clothes must remain here. Okay, let it be here. But the furnace must be removed. Removing the furnace means removing everything around it. And it needs a lot of time. Also patience. And hard work too. I think it's not suitable for us to touch the used utensils. I too think so. So, do we agree that the furnace will not be removed? I think we do agree. Is there anything left? - I don't think so. No, there's something. - What? This seat is lying in between. We must shift it. I agree. - So? So? - So, we must remove it. Yes, we must. So? - So? Remove it. - I? - Yes. Will you not do it? - No. Why? - There's no answer to your question. Still! I told you to remove it first. But you spotted it first. So? - So? Remove it. - You do it. Then let it be. - Let it be. Now? - Yes, now? Take a look around. Yes, take a look around. Is your job over? What do you say? - Yes, it's done. Isn't it? What do you think? - Yes, it's done. Only a glance is required. Yes, only a glance is required. Leave it. Piryangmanjari has reached. Madam has reached. Let's go. - Yes. She's the most cultured, simple and innocent girl... in the entire region. Come, Mallika. I was praising you to her. Ever since she has come here, she's asking about you. So, she's our Mallika. Life of this region. Mallika, which seat is selected for her? Matul, you can go and relax. My servants will wait outside for my return. But, the seat for you... Don't you worry. I won't find it uncomfortable. You will definitely be uncomfortable. It's another thing that you won't take it that way. And that's called mannerism. This is the refined quality of a higher clan that... You please rest. I've already made you jolt a lot. You made me jolt? You think I'll get tired because of you? I won't get tired even if you tell me... to go to the mountain peak and back to the valley... for several times. I'm very strong in that sense. I never show off. But in my clan, people are... not only talented but strong as well. I've followed the cattle for miles in a day. Because... You're exactly the same I had imagined you to be. Because... You may go. Don't worry about me. Okay, why should I worry? Mallika is here to worry about you. Ambika is also there. Still if there's any work, do let me know. You're very beautiful. You know what? Though we're unfamiliar... I don't feel like you're a stranger to me. Please, take a seat. No, I don't want to. Many times he had talked about this house and you. While he was creating Meghdoot... he often remembered this place. Today, this place attracted me to come here. Otherwise, the other path was more comfortable. He may not have come. But I forced him to come here. I wanted to see this region once. We'd be fortunate if you stay for some days. You might find it a little uncomfortable but... All the comforts of life can be sacrificed at this beauty. A lifetime is not enough to settle this beauty in our eyes. But I don't have that much time. Politically Kashmir's condition is unstable. And each day we spent out of Kashmir... can lead to many problems. Running a state is a big responsibility. And my responsibilities are more than that. Because Kashmir's situation is very critical. Even Kashmir's beauty is praised. But I won't have time to see that too. That's why I'm jealous of you. For me it's just a dream to take pleasure of this beauty. Sit down! Sit near me. I'll take another seat. It seems you love literature although being in this village. Whose creation are they? Of Kalidas! - Now, he's known as Matrugupt. Are his creations available even here? I've ordered it through the people coming from Ujjayini. I can understand. I know that you've been with him since childhood. Your love for his creation is very natural. He too gets lost at times while talking about the life here. That's why sometimes he gets defocused... from the royal activities. In such circumstances I need to take many efforts... to bring him back to focus. Running a state is not literature. Every moment counts there. If you miss out a single moment, disaster can happen. One has to remain alert to be on the seat. Literature was the first phase of his life. Now, he has reached the second phase. Most of time passes in making sure... that he might not step back. It takes a lot of effort. You won't understand it. I know nothing about the royal lives. Because, you've only lived in the village. Keep sitting. I told you I want to take along... some atmosphere of this region. So that he won't experience any lacking. Because, it makes a huge loss at times. Needlessly, he loses patience. Which wastes time and energy. His time is very precious. I don't want his time to get wasted. That's why I'm taking away a lot of things with me. Few deers. We'll look after them in our garden. The herbs of this region will be planted around... the playground and the surrounding region. I'll also build some houses like this over there. Matul and his family will accompany us. We'll take away a few orphan children and educate them. I think this will make some difference. I can see that your house is not in a good condition. It needs renovation. If you want I'll order our men for the renovation. Two expert masons have come with us from Ujjayini. What do you say? You're very kind hearted. But we're used to living in such a house. So, we don't find it uncomfortable. Still, I'd wish to renovate this house. This house also played a great role in the beginning of his life. I've ordered to build a new palace... on the plot of Matul's house I've ordered the architect to bring the stones... from Ujjayini and start working. I won't be able to stay here even for a moment until... the foundation stone is laid. We'll move on tomorrow morning. Why don't you join us? - Me? Yes, what's wrong in that? You're not bonded with anyone here that... My mother is here. This isn't a problem. We can also arrange for your mother's arrival with us. My architect will renovate this house. And you'll stay there as my friend. I'm sorry but I don't think I'm fit for this honour. But I think you're fit for much more than this. Two of my royal men had come here before me. I didn't send them for formality. Have you seen them? - Yes. I have. Your marriage can be arranged... with any one of them you choose. Both are worthy. Madam! - Maybe, you don't find them fit for you. But there are many officials in my state... not the two. Come with me. Whoever you wish... Stop discussing about this. Why? Don't you want to have a family of your own? No, she hasn't thought about it. Mother! - She hasn't thought about it. Because she lives in an emotional world. For her, life... - Why did you get up, mother? You're not well. C'mon, lie down. Can't I even talk to any guests? But, you're not well, mother. I'm much better compared to you. This house wasn't always in this condition. When I was alright, I used to keep it in good condition. Not everything here was broken or fallen around. But today, even the mother and daughter lives here are broken. That's because... I can see that the house is not in a good condition. Had Mallika agreed to come with me... problems would be clear. But now, even now... I'll do everything that's possible for me. I'll inform the architects to demolish this house... and instead... - Please, don't do that. Don't order them to demolish my house. I was saying this for your comforts. If you find it uncomfortable, it's okay. I won't give such order. Still, I would want to do something for you. I can't wait any longer now. I've to complete many important tasks... before I set out tomorrow morning. Actually, I didn't have time to come even now. But I thought it's important to come. He went to visit the mountain peaks. Meanwhile, I came this side. Okay. - I wanted to tell you something, royal lady. I wanted to tell you that we... I can understand your pain. I'll definitely help you in the way I can. For now, my servants are waiting. So... Read the lines of Meghdoot. Didn't I tell you the tenderness of his heart reveals in this? Today, we saw that tenderness reaching fineness. Royal wealth will renovate the house. Today he's a ruler, he has wealth. What could be the best solution than this... to prove to us about his wealth and power. But mother... - Mother knows nothing. Mother never goes deeply in emotions. Why are you so sad, Ambika? The entire village is jealous of your fortune today. It's a matter of pride if anyone from the royal family visits us. Not everyone gets this opportunity. I've lived only to see this day. Years lacking and sorrows of our life... bore such a big fruit that royal architects... will renovate our house. Sit down, Ambika. Today no one in this village has time to listen to you. And it's quite strange that the royal artisans... are making sculptures of everything here. They'll not miss a single tree or leaf... in making sculpts. There may be some other reason behind it. I never say that there can't be other reasons. It's very clear. They see everything here as a strange thing. And they want to present this strange things to the others. You, me, this house, this mountain... everything are the example of something strange for them. I praise their minute sighting. They see strange things even where there's nothing strange. I saw an artisan making the sculpt of... his own shadow under the sun here. They might find their own shadows... lazy under the sun here. Which was that demonic woman who would... catch someone from his shadow? I wish, I would be that demonic woman. So that today I... I... I told you to rest. Don't talk. Vilom, mother isn't feeling well. Let her rest. Yes, take her inside. The commotion of celebration in the village... might make her upset. I just came to inform you about the celebration. Surprising! Kalidas didn't feel it was right to pay you a visit. I heard they'll be leaving tomorrow. He didn't think it was right to come here. Because, he knows I'm still alive. What do you think, Mallika? Shouldn't he come here once? I have requested you to let mother rest at this time. She becomes upset with your talks. My talks make her upset? I think there's some other reason behind it. Ambika knows those reasons. I too can understand its meaning. That's why many of Ambika's unspoken words... come to my lips. You don't like me coming here. I know. It's not new to me. But I want to stay for some more time. I can see a horse rider coming down from the mountain peak. Possible, that this time he might want to... stop here for a moment. I too will know about his well being in this way. After all, we're old friends. Vilom! Your presence is not right in this situation. If you want to meet him... then this is not the only place you can meet him. But what's wrong in this place? I don't want you to be in my house at this time. Mother, tell him to leave. I don't want any unfitting situation to occur here. You're not well. And I don't want any talks... that can affect your health adversely. Vilom! I told you to leave. You don't know that... Fine, I'll leave. I don't want any unfitting situation... to occur because of me. But may I know what unfitting situation can occur? Vilom! I repeat, you please leave. Otherwise, an unfitting situation will really occur here. Is it so? Then I must go. Okay, Ambika. I'm concerned about your health. If possible take milk and honey. I've just extracted fresh honey. If you need, I'll... - We don't need honey. We've enough honey at home. Okay, Ambika. But if need anise, then don't hesitate. Mallika! Do you still cry... for him... for that man who? Don't say anything about him, mother. Mallika! - After few years. Who's it? - It's me. A small lamp is lit. Great change is visible in the condition of this house. Everything seems to be on the verge of ending. Matul! You came in this heavy rain? There was no place to take shelter other than yours. I thought whatever it is. Even today, you're the same Mallika for me. This monsoon is becoming my death. Earlier, when I could walk on my feet... I never cared about heavy rain. But now the situation is such that if I put a stick ahead... my leg slips behind. And when I put my leg ahead, the stick slips behind. Had I known I'll break my leg in the royal palace... I'd have never left the village to go there. And they've built my house in such a way that... I can't put my leg on the floor. Instead of these slippery stones the clay was much better. It'd at least let me rest my foot on it. I've become homeless in spite of having a home. I can neither stay out nor in. These white marbles remind me of the palace... where I broke my leg. You might find it difficult standing there. Take a mat. If anyone would ask me, I'd say that there can't be any... painful condition in this life than living in the royal palace. Servants all around you. Frankly speaking, I could never realise... if the servants are walking behind me... or I am walking behind them. The biggest happiness here is that... no one bends at me with respect... nor do I live under the illusion that... I'm surrounded by the servants. Only the rain troubles me. Shall I light a fire for drying clothes? What condition you've made to this house? Everything is kept disorderly after Ambika's death. It's true that Piryangmanjari had sent you... some clothes and royal coins? But you returned it? - I didn't need it. And she also told the architects... to renovate this house? I don't think the renovation is needed. Shall I light the fire? No, the rain has stopped. It's just drizzling now. I'd want to reach home somehow... and dry clothes over there. If it'd start raining again then... Did you hear any news about Kashmir? I always stay at home. How can I get any news? I heard it. I can't believe but I do. Nothing is impossible in the kingdom. It's equally possible and impossible. And it's also possible that what happens should not happen. But what are the news? The news is that the emperor died. Rebellions are coming into power in Kashmir. Has he left Kashmir? And shifted to Ujjayini? - No! Not yet. The people out there says he has accepted celibacy. And went to Kashi. But I don't believe it. He has received such respect in the capital... that if it was impossible for him to live in Kashmir... he could have gone to the capital. But it's also not impossible. One is the politician and second Kalidas. I could never understand anyone from both. I feel that whatever I understand about him... the truth is always different. And when I try to reach that different... truth becomes different than that. So, whatever I understand about him is always wrong. Now, you can come to a conclusion... what the truth could be. Has he really accepted celibacy or not? I think he hasn't become a celibate. So, the truth must be that he has become a celibate... and gone to Kashi. No! This can't be true. My heart doesn't accept it. What did I tell you? Whatever I say, will never be true. That's why I remain silent. Even if he has gone to Kashi, I'm wrong. And even if he hasn't then I'm wrong too. That's okay. No! You didn't go to Kashi. You didn't become celibate. I didn't tell you to leave this place for this. I also didn't tell you to go so that you'd rule a state. Still, when you did that I wished you best. Though, you didn't personally took my best wishes. Even if I did not remain in your life... you always remained in mine. I never let you wander from my side. You continued to create and I believed... that I too am meaningful. That my life is also productive. And today you'd make me a failure. You can be neutral from your life. But I cannot. Why don't you look at life from my point of view? Do you even know how I've passed these years of my life? What I've gone through? What have I become? Do you see this life? Can you recognize? She's Mallika who's growing up with time. And replacing mother, now I take care of her. This is the child of my lacking. No one could replace you in my life. And wonder who are there in this house that lacks a lot. Do you even know that I've lost my name and... got an adjective attached with me. Now, I'm not any noun but only an adjective. Professionals say that most of your time... passes with women in Ujjayini. But you've also seen this form of woman. Can you recognize me today? Even today I went to the mountain peaks... and watch the clouds forming. I still read Rhutusanhar and Meghdoot. I've never let my heart lose its emotions. But can you imagine the pain of my lacking? No! You can't imagine. You wrote, that one shortfall can easily hide... behind many fine qualities. Just like a black spot under the sunlight. But poverty can't hide. Not even when you've hundreds of qualities. No! It can never hide. It covers all your qualities. It destroys those qualities one by one. But I endured it all. Because, even after getting shattered... I felt that you're becoming something in life. Because, I used to see myself in you. And today, I get to hear that... you're going to become a celibate? You're becoming neutral. Getting rid of your duties. Will you deprive me of my rule? It's the same day of monsoon. Clouds have again formed. It's raining. I'm the same. In the same house. But... Maybe you don't recognize me. And it's very natural. I'm not the one you had known before. I'm another person. And frankly speaking, I'm someone... whom even I can't recognize. Why are you stunned like this? Are you surprised to see me? Surprise?! I can't even believe that it's you. And it's me who's watching you right now. I can see that even you're not the same. Everything has changed. Possible that only I can see the change. I can't believe that it isn't a dream. No, it's not a dream. It's true that I'm here. Tired and shattered after a long journey. Just came to see the reality here. You're drenched. I don't have dry clothes. But I... Don't worry about me getting drenched. You know what? Getting drenched like this also can be an ambition in life. I've been drenched for ages. I don't want to wipe it now. I was too tired of walking. Was in fever for many days. But this rain made me feel relaxed. You're too tired. I was tired. Even now I'm tired. But rain reduced my tiredness. You're really not recognizable. And you too are not. Even this house has changed a lot. And I was hoping that everything will be as it is. Exactly how I had left. Everything will be at the same place. But nothing is at its place. You've changed everything. Everything. Not me... I know. You didn't change. But Mallika... I never thought I will ever feel unfamiliar with this house. Every thing here was fixed at one place. But today, I feel everything is unfamiliar to me. And... and you too. You're tired. Sit down. Your eyes reveal that you're still not well. After wandering at many places for many days... finally I'm here. The reason why I didn't come before leaving for Kashmir... today I've come with that reason. Today itself I came to know from Matul... that you've left Kashmir. Yes, because my attachment for power and reign is over. Today, I'm away from all that... that had pierced me for years. People in Kashmir thinks I've accepted celibacy. But I have not. I've freed myself only from the name Matrugupt... so that I can again live with the name Kalidas. One attachment always dragged me to that throne... breaking which I had left this place. The warmth I felt in everything here... I never found it anywhere after leaving this place. I remember each and every thing that is here. Pot, basket, mat... lamp, designs made of red clay. And your eyes. The form of your eyes I had seen before leaving... is still fresh in my memory. I kept on assuring myself that whenever I return... things will be as it is here. The Doors are closed untimely. Let the door be closed. Go on talking. See who's at the door. It's rainy season. It can be anyone. You go on talking. He'll leave. Who was he? I told you, it can be anyone. Anybody needs shelter during rain. But I found his voice quite strange. You were talking about this place. I felt I'm familiar with this voice. Like everything here... even this a changed form of a familiar voice. You're tired. And also not well. Sit down and talk. Many times I thought about our relation. And reached a conclusion that Ambika was right. You were really surprised that... I'm going to take charge of Kashmir. You might have found it unnatural. But I don't see it unnatural. It was a natural reaction of life full of lacking. Possibly, it was mixed with the... feeling of revenge nurtured long ago. With all those who had taunted me and laughed at me. But I also knew that I won't be happy. I always felt that being lured by wealth and position... I've taken illegal entry into that region. And I've left the place where I should have been. Whenever I used to look at the horizon... I'd feel that I've lost from my path. I'd console myself that someday... I'll control the situation and divide myself between both. But the circumstances went on playing with me. The 'next day' I was waiting for, never arrived in my life. I never wanted to pass by this village to Kashmir I thought this region, the mountain peaks... and everything here will stop me. I didn't come to see you that time because I was scared. Your eyes might add up to the restlessness of my heart. I wanted to save myself from that situation. I knew what your reaction will be. What people will tell you. Still I was assured about our relation... that you'll never doubt me. And I left with a hope that there'll be a day... when I'll be able to tell you all this. And assure you about the dilemma of my mind. I never thought that dilemma can be in other's minds too. Change never affects just one direction. That's why after coming here today... I've realised the incompleteness. People feel that I've wrote a lot in this life... and in this environment But I know I haven't written anything over there. Whatever I have written has been gathered from this life. The landscape of Kumarasambhav is this Himalayas. And you are the ascetic Uma. The Yaksha's torment in Meghadoot is my own torment... and you are the Yakshini crushed by longing. Though I imagined myself to be here and... you to be with me in the city. In Abhijnanashakumtalam, it was you whom I saw... in the form of Shakuntala. Whenever I tried to write... I reiterated the history of your life and mine And when I tried to write something away from this... that creation was lifeless. Aaj's lament in Raghuvansh... was actually my pain that was expressed. I wish you could read it. But the connection broke in such a way... That connection was never broken. Meghdoot?! How could you get the copy of Meghdoot? I've all your compositions. Just few months ago, I could get the copies of... Raghuvansh and Shankuntalam. You've all my compositions? But how was it available here? What... Sometimes the business class people... of Ujjayini do take this path. And these copies are available with them? I had got it ordered. I could hardly get one copy in a couple of years. And the money to buy this? I could hardly get one copy in a couple of years. I had enough time to collect money. The lacking I felt from ages ago, today I feel them much bigger. I should have returned ages ago. I would have got drenched in the rain over here. And then write. But over there, I couldn't even reply a letter. And something that's churning my heart from years... like the monsoon clouds that gathers but can't rain... because it doesn't get proper season and breeze. What is this composition? These are only blank pages. I had done the binding of these pages. I thought I'll gift you this when you return from the capital. And I'll tell you to compose your best epic on these pages. But you didn't visit me even after coming here. And this gift remained with me. Now, these pages are almost wearied. And I'm hesitant to tell you that they're made for your creation. You made these pages yourself... so that I could create my best epic on this. Water drops are clearly visible on these pages. Undoubtedly, these are not raindrops. It seems you've written a lot on these pages by your eyes. And not only by your eyes... the pages have also become spotty. Dry petals have left it's colour on them. Your nails have torn them at many places. Your teeth have torn them. On top of that, these light but dark shades of sunlight. Season's images... and a lot more. These pages are not blank now. An epic has been created on it. An epic. What new creation can be made on these pages now? But life still remains after this. We can restart it. Mallika! Am I suspicious about someone's cry... This is my present. Your present?! On a wet day, I slipped directly into a valley. Many times I've told you not to climb high... but you would never listen. Earlier when I came, the doors were closed. So I returned and slipped off. Again I came and again the doors are closed. What could have happened had I returned? Today is such that... Wonder what's wrong with my eyes? Sometimes even the unfamiliar faces seem familiar. And sometimes even the familiar faces look strange. There are so many familiar faces here. But I can't recognize them. The face is familiar. But the person appears as a newcomer. So, mister, do you know me? Face has changed but you're the same person. Even the voice and the words are familiar. So, it's you... All the pains of falling down and getting hurt is over. I was longing to see you. Come... won't you hug me? Is it because my body is muddy? Or do you hate me? But our relation can't break up so easily. You told me we're very close to each other. Didn't you tell me? In these years, I never let... any distance create in our closeness. I feel now we're much closer than before. What say you, Mallika? Am I not right? Why are you standing still? Now, I'm not an unwanted guest in this house. Now, I come here with the right. No, now I can welcome and host Kalidas in this house. Right? Isn't it strange that we met in this house in the past... and also today. But frankly speaking, this isn't a coincidence. Whenever you'd come, we'd meet her. You haven't welcomed Kalidas yet. A guest has come home after many years... and you wouldn't even welcome him? Don't you know how Kalidas is attached... with everyone in this region? One deer lives in this house as well. Didn't you see Mallika's daughter? Her eyes are as beautiful as a deer. And do you know what her horoscope says? He said... Vilom! You don't want Kalidas to know her horoscope. But I don't believe it. I said that because maybe Kalidas can see her... and tell us how true the horoscopes are. Does she really resemble me or... Come, see... Go away, Vilom. Go away from this house or from the village? I heard the power has much strength. And wealth is capable of doing anything. I said leave for now. Because you've returned? Because the land you left years ago... you're feeling attached to it again today? Because your rights are permanent? As if there's no life beyond you. It's only you and no one else. But the time isn't heartless. It has given power to others as well. It has given rights. It doesn't wait for the worship. It has given time to others. It has done some creations. You feel jealous of its creation, too. Because, the place where you want to see yourself... you're failing to be there. You want me to go away. I'll go. Not because you've ordered me. But because you're a guest here. And a guest's wish is always met. Mallika, do not lack in hosting him. He's the guest, who have come after many years... and we never know if he'll ever come in the future. What are you thinking? I'm thinking that it was the same day of monsoon. Clouds have formed in the valley like this. And darkness spread untimely. I had seen an injured deer in the valley. And I picked it up and brought it here. You treated it. You're also thinking of something else. And I'm thinking that this region is the same. The path treading to the mountain peak is the same. Wind is also as damp as before. Environment is also as cold as before. And... And it's the same sense that experience shivering. Same heart that evokes desires. But... But the epic of these blank pages wasn't written that time. You said you want to restart. I said I want to restart. Possibly, it was the conflict of desires with time. But I can see that time is more powerful. Because... Because? Because it doesn't wait. Kalidas! Kalidas!
