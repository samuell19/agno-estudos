Hello? Hello? Somebody! Is anyone there? No! Get this off me, get this off me! Oh my God. Come on! Okay. Come on, come on! Ah! Can't you just stay over tonight? Please? Come on, I stay over almost every night, and you know I have to wake up early tomorrow. I'll just... I'll wake up early with you. I'm sorry, but noon isn't quite early enough. I... I wake up before noon. When the mood strikes. Oh. So you're gonna really wake up at seven on a Sunday with me? I... I will see you tomorrow. Thought so. Oh, oh. I still love you, but for now, go brush your teeth. And maybe set an alarm in case you accidentally hibernate through spring. Okay, okay. Just text me when you get home safe, all right? It's 10:30. Okay. Hey, Zane, you want any mac and cheese? Fine, more for me. Hey, dude, whatever happened to... The dishes don't need to soak? Damn it, Zane, really? Hey. Hey, dude, I think your laptop's broken. What is this place? What is this? What's happening? Where's the door? Hello? Hey! Can you hear me? Hello? Where are you? Hello, can you hear me? Hello? Are you okay? Oh, fuck. Ah... Oh, shit! Who are you? Hey, I'm talking to you. Hey! Can you hear me, hello? Fine, then fuck you, too. What are you doing to me? Who the hell are you? Listen. I don't know what's going on. What is this place? Oh my God! Zane? What did you do to him? What did you do to my friend? Ugh... Oh, God! Ugh... Ugh. He looks... He looks like, like a... Like a... Like a... Oh. Okay. All right. Oh, okay. Okay, you almost had me there, guy. Okay. You had me going there for a minute. Okay, come on, all right, Josh. Focus. Wake up, wake up. Wake up. Okay, one more time. This is a dream, just how do I get myself to wake up? Come on, come on, just focus, Josh. Wake up, wake up, wake up. Just wake up, just wake up. Oh, that's, that's a cool trick, by the way. Disappearing. Oh, hey. Hey, hey, buddy. Hey, man. Glad you could join us, rise and shine. Hey, how's it going? Oh, you okay? You hurt your head a little bit? Oh, yeah, it's fine. Dude, look at me, look at me, there we go. Hey, it's all right. It's a dream, buddy. It's a dream. Yeah, I know. It's scary, it's a scary dream. Terrifying. All right, just relax. Say, speaking of which, hey, look at me. Can you help me wake up? I don't wanna be here anymore. Ah... Oh God, that's cliché. Did you come up with that one yourself, Krueger? What are... What are you doing? Please. Oh, God! Please, please. Oh, fuck, that hurts. You don't feel like laughing now, do you? What's with your voice? Jesus Christ, please, just make it stop. - If you don't make it stop, man, I swear to God... - You swear to God, what? God isn't gonna help you now, Joshua. Goddamn it. You're seriously just gonna leave that up there? In the middle of the room? For everyone to see at all times, always? Yeah, it's an original print of "Man Bites The Dog". Do you know how rare this is? No, I don't, but I do know that it's a little off-putting, isn't it? Whatever, dude. If anyone asks, I'm telling them it's yours. It is mine. Anyway, think it's gonna live up to the hype? College, I mean. Realistically? I think it's gonna be the exact same as high school, but with teachers that know what they're talking about. I'm not talking about the classes, dude, I'm talking about the social atmosphere, the people. It ain't too late to join that fraternity, you know? Hey, first of all, I don't wanna join a fraternity. Second, what the hell's with you, man? You're not pumped, like at all? Okay, here, listen. Listen. Let me paint you a picture. It's Friday night, all the assignments are done. Our fridge is stuffed with cheap, cold beer, and all our new friends are looking for a place to hang for the night. But where, where will they go? That's... That's where we come in. You don't think they'd rather drink in their dorms? Or use their new fake IDs to go out instead? I don't know, maybe. At least we'd be an option on the list. Yeah, the last option. If you say so. Goddamn. Either way, one thing is for sure. Freshman year of high school was terrible, so it can't be worse than that. There you go, finally making some sense. Now just lose this sad dog attitude and you'll be all set. Who knows, you might even get a girlfriend. Look, even if she's a blow-up doll, I'm not gonna judge you. You're my best friend. Excuse me, where exactly is your girlfriend? Oh, wait, wait, wait, did she miss the bus here? Is that it? Fair enough, I guess we're both losers. Shit, hey. You got any glue? A lot of glue? Just throw that one out. Ow. Damn it. Uh, hey, are you gonna clean this up or save it for later? I think my mom must have snuck this in here. Hey, has anyone ever told you you're like really photogenic? Jesus! That's a déjà vu. - No. - Come here. - Let go of me. - I said come here. Let me fight out! Argh! Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh! What the fuck? Okay, okay, come on. Come on, just focus. Focus. What was the last thing that happened before I woke up in bed? Think. Where's the goddamn doors in this place? There's... There's gotta be a way out somewhere. If there's a way in, there's gotta be a way out. Oh, fuck, fuck. Okay, okay. Zane, Zane? Look at me, buddy, look at me. It's okay, hey, hey. Hey, hey. Relax, relax. Oh, shit, okay, hold on, hold on. Hold on, I got you, I got you, I got you. Oh, God! Okay, Zane. Is that better? Hey, hey, look at me, dude. Okay, just don't move your head, all right? Don't move your head. I don't know how much time we got in here. I... I have an idea. I'm just gonna ask you a few questions, okay? So... So do you remember summer camp rules? Blink one for yes and twice for no? Yeah, okay, good, good. Okay, so first question. Is there any possible way this is a dream? You're 100% sure? Your... Your hands. Look, I remember punching the mirror, and then I just... It was all black, man, like, I... I just... Oh, God! Did I... Oh, shit. Oh, goddamn it. Okay, okay. Do... do you know why? Did I say anything? You know that wasn't me, right? That thing, it took control of everything. Every single part of me is just... Everything. I couldn't... I couldn't move. I... I couldn't stop moving, I was just... It was everywhere. It was everywhere. I don't remember. It's just, I was just moving. I couldn't... I couldn't stop it. That wasn't me, okay? I just... Whatever that thing was, it took control of me. Hey, hey, hey, Zane. Zane, what are you doing? What are you doing, man? What are you looking at? There's nothing there, man. Okay? Hey, look at me. Okay. All right. Were you... Were you kidnapped? Do you remember how you got here in the first place? No, what, three blinks? Does that mean you don't know? Yes, you do know, or no, you don't know? Okay, okay, you don't know. That's okay. That's all right. Um... Okay, so... That man... That thing with the weird voice, do you know who that is? Okay. Where is this place, do you know where we are? No. Okay. Shit, well, then maybe you don't know more than me. Do you know why we're here? What? Hey. Hey, what do you mean, yes? Zane, look at me, what do you mean? Why would we be in here? What did we do? Look at me, man. Zane, look at me. Okay, okay. Uh... You... You weren't here, you must have come in from a different room, right? Like, do you know how you got into this one? Do you know how you got in here? You do? Okay, that's great. All right, you're gonna have to help me out here, man. That's great. Over here? This wall right here? There's... There's nothing here, man. What am I looking for? Shit. I can't... I can't... I can't see anything there, man. You gotta help me out here. No, please. Ahh! What was that? Zane, what the hell was that, man? Have you seen that before? Answer me! Have you seen that before? Oh, where are you, you piece of shit? Hey, listen to me. Whatever's gonna happen, know that it's not me. Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. - Hi, it's Zane Browning. - Goddamn it! - Leave a message. - Goddamn. Hey there, it's Shannon. Why is no one picking up their phones? 'Cause they're sleeping, of course. I gotta go. Hey, somebody! Help! 911, what's your emergency, Josh? - Who is this? - Hello? What's your emergency? - What? - What is your emergency, Josh? - Josh? - No, no. Oh my God, no. Come on, dude. Please, we have people over. Just show your face, just for a little bit. Please. I'll make you a deal. You'll even get to choose a few songs. Come on. Okay, okay, let me just finish this up first. Okay, cool. Thanks, man. ♪ I've got This animal instinct ♪ ♪ I know you have it too ♪ ♪ When I Can't keep it together ♪ ♪ It tells me what to do ♪ ♪ Animal instincts Animal instincts ♪ ♪ I've got This animal instinct ♪ ♪ It grips me like a vice ♪ ♪ My brain becomes inert ♪ ♪ With one thing on my mind ♪ ♪ Animal instincts Animal instincts ♪ ♪ Animal instincts Animal instincts ♪ We're Red Room, we'll be back in a half hour. Did you think any more about that question I asked you? I did, and my answer is absolutely not. You wouldn't have sex with Will Ferrell? No, that's not what I said. I said, I wouldn't do it for $5,000. Okay, that's fair enough. How about... Would you do it for a fancy new car? Well, what kinda car? A Camaro. Well, as tempting as a fast, impractical car sounds, that changes my answer in no way. Really? I mean, I'd have sex with him for a Camaro. You are such a boy! Tell you what. If you ever meet him and he is willing to buy me a Camaro... - Alright? - You can give him my number for me, and I will let you drive it. Okay. That sounds like a pretty decent deal. There's just one little problem. I, uh, I don't have your number. Ah! Let's fix that. But keep in mind this is only in the event of a Will Ferrell emergency. Everything okay? Yeah. Can you excuse me just for a second, please? Hey, DJ Doom, you got anything a little bit more crowd-friendly there? I figured I should put out a request for something a little more interesting. Yeah, well, this is definitely that. You want a beer, man? No, thanks, I'm all right. Who's that girl you were talking to? Her name's Shannon. You met her tonight? Nah, she's in one of my classes. What? No, it's just, that looked... Easy. Getting her number. It is easy, dude. All you need is a little bit of confidence. And some backup jokes if all else fails. I know you've got the confidence, but your jokes could use a little work. Where have you been? I haven't seen you all night. Yeah, no, I was working on my Master's program application. Oh, that's cool. Find any new information as to why we're so fucked up? - No. - No? No. No recent discovery, no, but I believe the simple answer to that is, is our parents. That sounds about right. Hey, boys, mind if I make a song request? I'm Shannon, by the way. I don't think Zane here would mind handing the aux over for a song or two, right, Z? Yeah, sure. Here. Bad girl, you need to be punished! Oh, I'm so sorry. - No, that's just... - I'm so sorry. I think I clicked the wrong button. - What'd you see? - Nothing. Naughty slut, I'll make your ass burn! It's porn, everybody watches porn, that's fine. - Give me. - Hey, okay, so you like naughty schoolgirls. That guy probably likes feet, it's no big deal. I should really get back to my readings. What the fuck, dude? Oh my God! It's so embarrassing. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have clicked it. Don't worry about it. I mean, the guy's my best friend, but he's probably the worst person to have at a party. Speaking of parties, let's start this one, right? Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention for a moment? Thank you very much for coming to this party of ours, and we have a surprise for you. A surprise guest even. I don't know if you guys know her. Close friend of mine. Very, very nice person. Her name is little Miss Molly. All right, all right. So everybody gets one. - Thank you. - Ladies first. And pass it on. I want this back, okay? I don't wanna find this empty somewhere. Take one, pass it on. Hey, hey, Zane. Dude, wake up. I think I know what's going on. Hey, just... hey, just... I don't know if you can hear me, just, just... Oh... Oh, God! Oh, God! Okay, just... Oh my God. All good. Okay. It's okay, just... I don't know who's doing this to us, and I don't know why, but I... but I think... I think I know how we're getting in here. Your laptop, it's... I don't know, man. I think it's... it's cursed or something. I... I smashed it with a hammer. It just fucking reappeared, completely intact, I just... I... Look, I don't know how, but I'm gonna destroy it, okay? Oh my God. I'm... I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for everything. I just... I keep losing control, but I think I can... I think I can get it back. Okay, I need you. I need to get out of here. I need to get back to our house, okay? Okay, I'm gonna get us out of here. Okay, just... You just gotta believe, man. No! Who are you? You're that girl. From the video. That's you, isn't it? Am I dead? But you're dead. I don't know who you are, but I'm sorry that happened to you. Nobody deserves that. I don't... I don't know why I'm here. But please, please, don't kill me. And whatever I've been doing to my friend, can you make that stop? I... We... we... we didn't do anything to you. I don't... I don't understand why I'm in here. I'm a good person. And so is he. I would never do that to a woman. Or to anyone. I don't know why. No, no, no, please, please. Please make him stop, please make him stop what he's doing to me, please. No. Oh, God! - Close your eyes. - No, please. Please, don't do this. It's time to close your eyes now. Hey, uh... I just wanted to apologize for the schoolgirl joke earlier. I was just... I was just trying to make you a little bit less embarrassed, and it backfired. Hey, hey, Zane, are you listening? Zane, what are you... I can't anymore. No more. No, no, please! Please! No more, please! Stop! Oh, no! No, please! Let me go! No, no! I can't... No! Ew. What was that, man? Nothing. - How did you get in here? I swear I locked the door. - That girl, she... It's just porn, like you said earlier. She was covered in... It's just a fantasy, okay? It's not real. Okay, wait, wait, I don't judge the shit that you're into. Listen, that girl Shannon's out there right now. What if... What if she saw? Why are you here right now, huh? I don't like parties, you know that. Why can't you just let me do my own thing? That's right. Get out of my room. Get out! Okay. Nice kill. Thanks. You think you're gonna... Gonna go to that Dev's thing in a few weeks? I heard his cousin is in some semi-famous band, they're apparently gonna play in his basement or something. Hm, we'll see. So you got any... any plans for the long weekend? Me and Shannon were thinking about maybe doing an escape room or something. I got a couple projects that I wanna get started on. Cool, cool. Hey, you gonna need a ride home for spring break? Hello? I asked you if you need a ride home in a few weeks. Yeah, I was thinking of staying here this year. What do you mean, stay here? I have a lot of work to do, and I just can't focus at home. Wait, no, dude, you can't just stay alone here in this shit hole. I mean, I know your mom's new boyfriend is a total douchebag, but staying here alone is, I genuinely can't think of anything sadder. Tell you what, why don't you just join my crazy-ass family? Maybe you'll get some ideas for a new project. I could always use some inspiration. Right? Especially from your sister. God, she is one peculiar case of crazy. Remember that one Christmas when she dumped a plate of food on my dad? Yeah, why was she so pissed again? She just, you know, refused to stop texting at the dinner table or something and my dad just, you know, wasn't having it, so he took the phone away. - Oh, yeah. - And she lost it. Yeah, and... oh my God! And your parents were like, "Kristen, we have guests, you cannot behave that way." Yeah, like it was acceptable behaviour if I wasn't there. Yeah, right? You want a beer? Uh, no, thanks, I'm good. All right. Hey, um... Don't you gotta go get your laundry? Oh, no, yeah, I completely forgot. Hey, don't unpause until I get back. Yeah, of course. Yeah, it's an original print of "Man Bites Dog." No! No, no! No, no! No, no, no! Josh? Josh? Josh. Yo, let me in, what are you doing? Why would you lock the door? Just force of habit, I guess. Where's your laundry? Uh... It wasn't dry yet. All right. Maybe just, maybe you lay off the molly? Shit is killing your brain. All right. Uh, you gonna come back to play or are you done? Yeah, sure, let's play. Uh, by the way, I was thinking about what you said earlier, and I am gonna take that ride home for break. I really appreciate the offer. Of course. Seriously, what's up, man? You look completely off right now. Everything's fine, it's just as you said, it's a molly hangover. I'm fine, let's just play. If you say so. Did you know her? The girl on the website? Did you know her? I swear to God, I've never seen her before in my life. You're missing the point. What do you mean? Now what about your friend over there? What? What about him? Why do you think you're even here? I don't, I don't know. You're a smart boy, Josh. You can figure this one out. I didn't mean to click that link. Just try to understand, I just wanted to know what my friend was watching, - and I wanted to know if he needed help. - Did he need help? Yeah, he did. I didn't know how bad it was until then. I didn't know what to say, I didn't know how. Is that so? Can't you see where I'm coming from? Can't you see where I'm coming from? Okay, look, I... I'm sorry that happened to you. It was wrong, it was terrible. If you don't let us go, then you're no better than the man who did this to you. I don't wanna have to do this to you. But I'm going to. Why? Uh, okay, okay. Please, I'm... I'm sorry. You're right, you're right. I'll talk to him, okay? As soon as we get out of here, I'll talk to him. I'll have him get help. No, it's too late for that now. Oh, God! Please. I made a mistake. I'm... I'm just fucking 21 years old! I have one last thing to show you. Okay. Please, please. Please, don't make me do this. You don't have to punish us, please. Do you think he deserves to live? Yes, yes. Please, yes. Yes, I do. I thought I deserved to live, too. Oh, God! Please. Please, don't make me do this. Okay, wait. Wait a minute, wait, wait. What are you making me do? Oh, God! Oh my God! Please. Oh my God. Please. Please, don't make me do this. Zane? Are you in there, man? What the... Have you ever heard of knocking, what the... Dude. I just had literally the worst dream of my entire life. So you're swearing off drugs, then? Dude, you're not, you're not listening. It was so vivid. It was insane, your eyes were gone, your mouth was sewn shut, you'd lost a hand. Dude, it was terrible. Well, dreams are just a way for our brains to dump excess data. You know that, right? They don't mean anything. Okay, look. I'm fine, okay? My lips aren't bleeding, my eyes are still there, and I still got my right hand, see? How... How'd you know it was the right hand? Hello? Where am I? What's going on?
