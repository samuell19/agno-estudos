You crazy fool! You stupid fool What's going on with you? Identification papers state Richard Porter from Melbourne. Australian wool merchant. He's 66 years old and single. He was fished out of the Thames this morning. - Cause of death? - Drowning. Are you sure, Doctor? - Absolutely. Accidents like this happen almost every time we have fog. And what if I say that I don't agree with your findings this time? Excuse me, Inspector, I'm just a doctor, not a detective. I simply determine the causes of death. You know I value your experience greatly. Determining murder is something I leave up to you. Doctor, are these the personal effects of the deceased? Personal effects? In his wallet they found 300 pounds. Porter was a millionaire. And he wore glasses. What's this here? Just a piece of paper. It was found in his trouser pocket. Strange looking, been in the water a long time. Looks like a kind of parchment, doesn't it? Raised points? Doctor, this is Braille isn't it? - Yes. The death certificate is in order. Then the insurance money will have to be paid in full. Just like the case of Mr Lennox from Cape Town... accidental death by drowning. And a few months later a Mr Berangari from Bombay... he fell into the water and was drowned too. You forget about the law of averages, Sir John. These cant be all accidents. Always a foggy night. Always men who wear glasses and can be easily attacked. And always rich men from abroad without a family in England. If you had the slightest shred of evidence. Money. But you haven't. All you have to go on is suspicion. What's that? A clue, and the basis of all my suspicions, Sir John. This was wrapped around Porters body when they found it. It could have happened in the water. Yes, of course, Sir John. I must say however I'm prepared to hang myself with it, if this isn't a premeditated killing. Now, don't jump to conclusions. If we could only find out what the message in Braille says. You'll learn that soon, my boy. I've hired a specialist for you. I think that'll help to clear up the matter, he's waiting in your office now. Already? Thank you, Sir John. How do you do? - Good morning. I'm Inspector Holt. My name is Nora Ward. You're very different from what I expected. Oh, in what way? Older. I'm flattered, you're a surprise too. In what way? Younger. I understand you're a Braille expert. When I was really young I taught Braille to the blind in east Asia. Really? And your parents let you go there alone? I was not careful in my choice of parents. You see, I was forced to support myself. Shall we get to work? What? Yes sure. Here. This wont be simple as I thought. Probably. This thing has been floating in the Thames for a while. Is not very clear. I cant make out all the words. - But... The word cry is recognisable. And one other word... Murder... - Go on. Strange. The blind monster and his master It certainly looks as those blind killers of London are at work again. The blind killers of London? They're a band of thieves and killers, blind pedlars who commit crimes in the dead of night. Especially in fog, when they take advantage of others. Come in. This is my assistant, Sergeant Harvey, called Sunny, because of his golden disposition. Miss Ward. Pleased to meet you. - I'm enchanted. Not since the hatchet murderess, Lady Mix Pickles, was here for questioning have we been honoured by such beauty. I must say, I'm flattered. He's really quite a harmless case. Were you able to find out anything? Oh, do you knit? And why shouldn't I, Miss Ward? The best psychiatrists recommend it, to calm his overwrought nerves. Well, in fact, it so happens that I'm knitting 2 pullovers I need this winter for myself. How lovely - He's quite a fellow. In addition, I knit sweaters for the Salvation Army and the Red Cross. Yes, but not for me. You're not the sweater type, sir. Shall we get down to cases? Very well, sir. I know everything. Well, quite a big order. What for example? - For example Richard Porter had a life insurance policy with the Greenwich company. Greenwich company, I've never heard of it. A small outfit, sir. A kind of family business, it's known as a reputable company. It's run by two brothers, and one of them recently died. Mr. Strauss, you should have gone to the bank. He has I've been waiting for your secretary to leave the office. Flea-bite Fred Same as ever, Mr Judd. I'll give you three guesses what I've come for. I only need one. You've come to visti me or talk about the weather report? Very funny. I suppose you still have a strong prejudice against check? No. What I'm interested in is cash money to play with. Don't point you piry like that. I don't keep any money to play with. Only in special cases, when I have blackmailers to deal with. Well, if unfriendly words could kill, I'd drop dead right on the spot. Unfortunately you don't. - Here. Don't bother counting, it's the right amount. I've have confidence in you, Mr. John. Sentimental nonsense, me giving you money just like that. It certainly wasn't my fault that your brother went abroad on a holiday with my girlfriend. He was lonely, like most rich men. Oh, is that so? Why did he stay abroad for weeks, under a false name? It was simply because under that name, he might receive an enormous amount of money from you. He had large debts to pay. He had to find the money to pay them back. Besides, that was long ago, and my brother has been dead for some time. In spite of that, the firm does business in his name. What do you think would happen if I spill the whole messy story? That the well known David Judd, who was buried with all honours and dignity... Why you swine, you filthy pig. My brother was the best man who ever breathed. And a miserable creature like you casts aspersions on his name... Why you... Take it easy, John. Eeeasy Can I be of any help to you, sir? Well, Flea-bite Fred, they sprung you out of the sanatorium? You want an insurance policy on your diamonds, or your pretty face? In both cases I'm afraid it would be a bit expensive for a bird like you. Nervous? I'm Inspector Holt of Scotland Yard can I do something for you, sir? No, Inspector, we were having a friendly discussion on the payments of a policy, and we didn't see eye to eye. It's straightened out now In the end, Greenwich insurance always pays what it owes. Well, I'll be seeing you. If you come around here I'll give you a policy, but you'll be paying the premium for many years. Thank you Inspector, you saved my life. He's really one of my clients, but he's difficult to get rid of. Won't you please take a seat. - Thank you. Mr. Judd, I've come about Richard Porter from Melbourne, the man who drowned in the Thames recently. He had a life insurance policy with you. Yes, you know we've had three of these cases lately. If we didn't protect ourselves by reinsuring with bigger companies, we'd be completely ruined. I hear there are plenty of scandalmongers who claim the firm is virtually wiped out. You see, I'm the man who runs the organisation ever since my brother died. Your brother, David, I believe. Yes. I just can't believe he's gone. It was heart failure. These business worries were too much for dear David. A cigarette Inspector? All right, I'm coming. Hey, ciao. - You a club member? No, but I'd like to become one. Got references? - References? I know Inspector Holt of Scotland Yard, and I know him personally. Ten on a red and this on a number 12, 27, 38. Daddy's flying high tonight. Are you so sure? Put this on the 14 14. No more bets, gentlemen. To what do I owe the honour Inspector? I've just have a few questions. Tell me, why is Stephen Judd giving you money? Get a crystal ball if you want to find out. Do you take me for a fool? I'm not an information bureau. You don't have a warrant by any chance? No I don't - 17 black Well I'll be damned. Not too bad, there goes my money, you've won the pot. I won't hold it against you. That's sweet of you, Fred. But you still haven't answered my question. And why should I? - Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. Do you happen to know anything about the blind killers of London? Place your bets. Do you want me to talk about Blind Jack? Why not? Why wouldn't you talk? Blind Jack only follows orders. I know. I know, but maybe I give the orders Place you bets, ladies and gentlemen. What's wrong? You leaving already? A fine place this is developing into. In the future I'll have to look over the guests more carefully. Scotland Yard. This is Holt - Give me the file department. Headquarters, central files, who is speaking? Holt. Will you get all information for me on a certain character known as Blind Jack? Blind Jack? - Yes. Very well, sir, I'll be right over. I've been waiting for you. That's nice of you, may I ask why? I always wait for the winners. Shall we have a little champagne or something? Some other time. All right, just as you say. You might like to try gambling with me. I always bring luck. Wonderful, why don't you gamble for yourself? I simply can't afford it now. I'm broke, I've spent everything. End of the 1st chapter. Why don't you pawn this bauble to get out of the red? Nothing doing, I'm not that hard up, yet. And besides, it was a gift. Yes, of course, from the Shah of Persia. Congratulations. Nonsense, it was a gentleman who gave it to me. If you even know what that means. He's the finest guy in the whole world, but he passed away. And crumbs like you are alive. Fanny, you shouldn't talk to customers like that. Bear in mind that we're a respectable club. What kind of impression will you make on Scotland Yard. Scotland Yard? - I'm so sorry. Pardon me. I guess I don't know a gentleman when I see one. Right? We all make mistakes. Here, a little present from Scotland Yard. - Thanks. She's rather nice, isn't she? Her name is Fanny Weldon. For many years she was the mistress of your friend, Flea-bite Fred, till she took off one fine day with a big insurance man from the city. His name was David Judd. Then the poor fellow died. Thank you. Cheers. Thanks just the same. Good evening, Inspector. - Good evening, Miss Ward. Glad you could come tonight, we can go now? It's a bit late to go out for supper, Inspector. Don't you think? Out to supper? I had slight exaggeration I fear, sir. My weakness you know. I trust you'll forgive his sense of humour, Nora. We have an extremely important clue we must follow up at once. We? How do I fit into the picture? I have to make a visit which may require your help professionally. Sunny, read us his record. - Very well, sir. Jacob Farrell also known as Blind Jack, lost his eyesight when he was two years old. Age about fifty. Height, six feet four. Occupation pedlar. Has unusually great physical strength. Tends towards acts of violence. Mentally retarded. Easily subject to bad influences. Last known address 25 Blossom Lane. Looks as they are all asleep. Yes, it looks like it. Good evening. May I speak to the director, please? Visitors, why the reverend will be overjoyed, we almost never have visitors. Come in, please. Who is it? Visitors, reverend. Visitors, at this hour of the night? Excuse us for disturbing you, reverend. My name is Holt. Inspector Holt, Scotland Yard. This is Miss Ward and my assistant Sergeant Harvey. Scotland Yard. - Yes, reverend. We're looking for a blind pedlar in connection with a murder case. Oh, I hope it's not one of my pensioners. When I assumed directorship here it was known as a hiding place for shady characters. but I believe I've succeeded in my efforts to improve it. I'm looking for a certain Jacob Farrell, known as Blind Jack, do you know him? I'm sorry to say that name is completely unfamiliar. Our pensioners are all investigated before being admitted. On our police records, however, this is the last address we have. I used to know Blind Jack, reverend. Is that you Norris? - Yes. Tell the police everything you know. Well, Blind Jack used to live here before the reverend came. Do you know where he is now? He hasn't been around here for a long while. What is it? What's the matter? Here - A Braille message. One of the blind men may have put it in here, sir. Can you decipher it? - Yes. The whole town is threatened by the blind killer, and Blind Jack sometimes comes here at night. The reverend knows nothing. One of the blind men has the information we want, but he's afraid to speak. Yes, but which of them? There were more than two dozen. We must find him, and speak to him alone when he has nothing to fear. Maybe we might be able to learn something from the janitor, he can see, perhaps he may help us? Nora. Yes? - I have a better idea. You observe what's going on in there. You must see the reverend and pretend you want to assist him in his work for the blind, or something like that. Yes, I understand. Will you do that for me? For you, yes. For Scotland Yard, perhaps. - Thank you. There, I've signed the document, I'll drop by a bit later tonight. There's a man waiting outside a Mr. Gordon Stewart from Canada. He wishes to speak to you personally about interest policy. All right, show him in. Come in, Mr. Stewart. - Thank you. How do you do, Mr. Stewart? Won't you sit down, please? Hello, its me, Edgar. The deals off. He's coming back here tonight His cars parked in the parking place, a light Mercedes with a black top... you cant miss it. Licence plate DUL845 - Mmm-hmm, I'll look for it. Flea-bite Fred got cold feet at the last minute when he found your boss talking with a police inspector from Scotland Yard. It's understandable, isn't it? I'm counting on you, Fanny. Your policy is in order, Mr. Stewart. I notice you have no family. Your beneficiaries are all charitable organisations. No, that's something I'd like to modify so that my daughter inherits everything. Your daughter? Yes, please take her name down. Eleanor Finley. She's my illegitimate daughter. However, I'm straightening everything out now. I'm seeing a lawyer this afternoon. Certainly, as you wish Mr. Stewart. It's often said that rapid decisions are unwise. You know its a matter of hundreds of thousands of pounds? Yes, it may surprise you I know, but inside of that, a few short hours ago, I learned that my daughter is alive. What's the address of Miss Eleanor Finley? I haven't yet been able to find her, I only know that she's alive. You wouldn't believe the difference it makes. London seems so beautiful all of a sudden, in spite of the bad weather. Yes, its very heavy fog. See that you get a taxi right away, before the traffic is paralysed. Damn this blasted fog. What have you got against it, sir? According to statistics, there are as many as 40 days of fog in London in every single year. Who will the victim be tonight? At the moment, sir, I think we have no cause for alarm, because consulting the list of foreigners in London I find millionaires are very scarce for some reason. Just ask hotel porters what they get in the way of tips. Come in. We've got company. Don't be shy Fred, come in. Poor sinner comes to confession. No, I just came by for a lesson in knitting, Your nimble fingeres alright, but not for knitting. You belong on television. - What's on your mind? Here, this came in this morning's mail. Oh, why don't you sit down? Today happens to be my birthday. - Congratulations Yes, on behalf of Scotland Yard. Many thanks. Well, at first I thought it was from one of my old girlfriends. I keep on good terms with all of them, its a matter of principal for me. Very wise. Well, how can I tell you, Inspector. I'm unwrapping the cake and about to taste it, along comes my dog grabs the first piece, swallows it, rolls his eyes, falls down and drops stone dead. It's such a beautiful animal. It shouldn't happen to a dog. A tragedy. Sunny, take it to the laboratory. - Very well, sir. Fred, the least you could do is to give me a couple of names so I'll have something to work on. To tell the truth, I don't know where to start, Inspector. Nowadays it's awful. There's just no more brotherly love. If I only knew the last who was driving that truck. What kind of truck? Someone in a big delivery wagon tried to run me over and nearly killed me. I'll swallow the whole of that birthday cake if they weren't trying to kill me. You will help me, Inspector? It's the business of the police. You've got to protect us citizens Yes, I know, Fred. I know, even you. - Yeah. Then give me at least a couple of points I can work from. Could it be Blind Jack? I only know it was a big white delivery truck. Maybe from a laundry. It had a left hand drive. Is anybody there? Who is it? Hello there, Mr. Judd. - Who are you? This may surprise you. I was your brothers sweetheart. My brothers dead. I know that. I also know that he was in love with me. Really in love. And believe me, I mourned him longer than you. Very nice of you, I'm sure. Well, may I ask what you've come to me for? Flea-bite Fred's received quite a lot of cash from you. Yes, well he wont be getting any more. Won't you take me for a drive. How do you do, Miss Nora? - Good evening. Is that you, Lou? - No reverend, its me. Oh, Miss Ward. How nice of you to visit us. I can hardly tell you how happy it made me to get your call. It wasn't so easy to find the place in that heavy fog. Yes, yes, its absolutely dreadful tonight. It makes me appreciate it so much more that you came. My friends, Miss Ward has been kind enough to visit us in the past. And has asked if she may come more often to see us in the future. Isn't that kind of her? I'm so glad your just in time for our music hour. Beethoven's the fifth, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. And now, with your permission, we'll start. We're accustomed to punctuality and they are all waiting. There's a man missing, isn't there? Very observant you are, Miss Ward. - I know who it is. The little man with the scar on his face, who said he knew Blind Jack She must mean Lou. - Lou Norris That's right. He has the kind of face one doesn't easily forget. Lou did not show up for supper this evening. When you rang, I thought that he was at the door. Now, take a seat please. Can I help you reverend? Please. Don't Jack, don't do it. I cant stand anymore. I cant bear it. At night I lie awake, I can't sleep. I've never seen your face. But I have nightmares. I see you staring at me, Jack. I'm not going to help anymore, I'm going put a stop to all this. I'll go to the police, yes. Once you join up with me pal, you stay. What kind of a neighbourhood is this? I don't know myself, I'm lost. Now, what do you know about my brother? At the time we were in Scotland. he was living under a false name, did you know about it? He called himself Zoug. Well, when a man's having a little romantic adventure he can change his name. If, in your opinion I was only a little romantic adventure you're way off the track. Then one sunny day the postman came with a very large money order. An enormous sum for a certain Mr. John Shaw. And it was all paid to David immediately on the basis of his false identification. Flea-bite Fred knows about it and that's why your paying him now, isn't it? So you're blackmailing me? Now get out! What, way out here? - You can walk home. I'm not responsible for my brothers mistakes. What would you say if I had an article written about your company in a scandal column? All right. I fail to understand how your mind works. My brother was good to you. So, if i can be of help. Please. Now will you tell me who tipped you off? Of course not. - Flea-bite Fred? Certainly not, not Flea-bite Fred. Who was it? Someone you wouldn't even think of suspecting. Well well, aren't you Mr. Judds secretary? Isn't it a bit early to be visiting Miss Wheldon? I don't know you, I'm sorry. Oh that doesn't matter, because we know you, including your prison record. Two years in prison for forgery, Mr. Edgar Strauss. I'm on probation for good behaviour, Inspector. So, you know me all of a sudden? Listen, don't tell Mr. Judd about the prison record will you, Inspector Holt. No, I've nothing against you, only against Miss Wheldon. Mr. Judd has called on us, blackmail. Looks as if she isn't in now - Or else she's hard to wake up. The door wasn't even locked. The last visitor seems to have left in a great hurry. It's most peculiar, sir. If I may take the liberty of pointing out, that nothing was removed except a certain ring, A gift she got from David Judd. Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Inspector. Larry, this morning they fished another body out from the Thames. Good gracious, and this isn't even the fishing season, isn't it, inspector? Official version, another accident. Fog, same as usual, elderly man. A millionaire from Canada, he wore glasses. My theory Chief Inspector. Well, Larry, I don't believe it was an accident myself. Here. And once again we have a piece of rope that was tied around the victims legs. And now I know why. A weight must have been fastened something, I don't know what it was, to make the body sink. But Larry, then the body wouldn't have risen to the surface. Perhaps our murderer wanted the body to appear. That's it, of course. He wanted the body to be found, to make it look like an accident. Since only if it was proved, could the insurance money be collected. It must have been something... that dissolves in water. Sir! Sugar... Or salt. Oh no, Inspector, I'm afraid I don't see how Mr. Stewart went out of the house, I was quite convinced he'd gone to bed last night. And you say the door was left open? Just a little crack. You're not trying to suggest, Inspector, that Mr. Stewart jumped over the balcony, are you? It doesn't seem likely. May I help you? - Oh please. Did it burn out? - Yes, it was new less than two weeks ago. The floor was covered with bits of glass this morning. A moment Mrs. Brooks When a bulb burns out it simply doesn't burn any longer. It usually doesn't break into a thousand pieces, now does it? No, no, no, this time someone has deliberately smashed it. Mrs. Brooks, were you aware Mr. Stewart was a rich man? No, I must say I never thought so. But he was a fine man, I can size them up right away. I'm sure you can, Mrs. Brooks. But tell me, can you think of any reason why he especially wanted to live in your house? Yes, because he'd been here once before. When? Twenty two years ago when he was in London on a visit. He said to me very often that it was in this very room, that the loveliest hours of his life had been spent. That sounds very romantic. Mrs. Brooks, can you give us any information concerning Mr. Stewart's habits or his private life? Who came to visit, were there any phone calls? Please Inspector, don't spy on my house guests. Goodness. While he was here he didn't receive anybody. But there was a taxi that called here every morning, he'd climb in and drive away in it. And where did he go, Mrs. Brooks? - Where? I wouldn't know that. Here. I used to drive the gentleman you described to this place almost every day. To the cemetery? Yes sir, that's right over there, where you see those men is where he used to go. Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning. - Are you the stone cutter? Yes. Taste good. Yes. That's really a lovely stone you're erecting. But a little late for the deceased to appreciate the gesture. Yes, but better late than never as they say. Tell me, who gave you the permission to set up that stone? An elderly gent, I don't know him. They spoke about a youthful romance. Did he give his name, by any chance? Yes, of course. He gave me a check to pay for it, his name was Stewart. Gordon Stewart? - That's right. That's quite a coincidence. - What do you mean a coincidence? Well, less than an hour ago. There was another chap here who asked the same questions. What did he look like? Well, now that's difficult to say. Thin, like you, a little bit older perhaps. I'd say, he was about forty or so. How was he dressed? A raincoat like yours, but no hat - His features? Well... Well, I don't remember, you see, he was wearing a pair of those dark glasses, I couldn't see his face. - I see. Well, thank you. Don't mention it. Goodbye now. - Goodbye, sir. So farewell, Michelangelo. - Thank you. Try to think about this logically, Sunny. More than 20 years ago, Mr. Gordon Stewart and a certain Miss Finley had a glorious interlude which gave life meaning. Yes, and the result of this interlude... A daughter, Louisa. Alas, the poor baby died at birth, sir. That's right. If you are able to enlighten me, who the man with the dark glasses was? You're even cleverer than you think you are. 13 black. Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets. Well, Mr. Strauss. You don't seem to be doing very well. You mind your own business. With the peanuts you make working for Judd, you just cannot keep this up. Do you know anything better? No. You have the key, don't you? Key? What key is that? To Fanny's place. I've no idea what you're talking about. The police are looking for it everywhere. And her last guest must have had a key to the apartment. I'm afraid she never gave one to me. Wait a second... Once when she was a bit too much drunk, she was telling wild stories, talking about someone dead and about a glorious romance. And about the key. If only I knew who she was talking about. You mean, you don't? You haven't been working for the company long enough. Use your head, think. You're not too smart, are you? Stephen Judd. Yes, of course, it's all so obvious. His brother could have the key. This is our big chance, we should take advantage of it. So you double crossed Judd? Now place your bets, we'll see how you do. Don't forget though, Self preservation is the first law of survival. Place your bets. All you've got to do now is win this. Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets. Place your bets. The bets, please. No more bets. Whose speaking? Flea-bite Fred... I've said repeatedly, I don't want to be bothered. Come on, why are you so unpleasant with me, Mr. Judd? I happen to have a little information for you. The police are looking for the man who has the key to Fanny Weldon's apartment. You can take your choice, whether you want to be bothered by me or by the Homicide Squad. I don't want to discuss this subject on the phone, my friend. What if we were to sit down together and talk over the matter. Lets say in an hour at my office. How's that? Good. I'll wait for you. What did you bring us here for? Well, you asked me to take you to all the places where the old gentleman went. Yes, sure, but this section? I was surprised myself, sir, but that's where he went. Well sir, I think we should follow suit. Inspector Holt. - Miss Nora. What brings you here? Were you looking for me? No, I'm quite surprised to find you here. I wanted to speak to the owner. My aunt is out. Someone was here this morning and induced her to leave under false pretences. But please come in, won't you? - Thank you. Does your aunt live here? She isn't really my aunt, you know. I'm a foundling and she brought me up. Since I've been on my own, I only come here once in a while. Today, when I had come especially to visit her... Yes? I'm just so worried about her. Please, tell us what happened this morning. A man in a car came by this morning and brought aunt Ella news that I've been hurt and was in the hospital critically ill. She was so upset that she left with him at once. Since then she hasn't been seen. Did anybody see the car? Yes, Miss Brown, that works here with my aunt. Tell me, gorgeous, what kind of vehicle did they take your mistress away in? It was a delivery truck... And the man, what did the man look like who bamboozled her? Thin. He wore a light raincoat - What did his face look like? Well, its hard for me to tell you, he was wearing a pair of dark glasses. The same story all over. - You're dead right, sir. Nora. Yes? Did you ever hear your aunt mention a man called Gordon Stewart? Gordon Stewart? Yes. - No, I don't think so. Who is he? He was a rich Canadian who drowned in the Thames last night. And this is one of the last places we know he visited before he died. That's why we've come here today. Well... Sunny. - Yes, sir. Will you please see to it that Miss Ward gets safely home. With pleasure, sir. With great pleasure. There are no signs of violence. The length of time the body was in the water, and the condition of the lungs, leads us to conclude the cause of death was accidental. Medically speaking. Yes, but on the basis of previous cases it looks to me like deliberate murder. That's what we call you for, Larry. Here, this was found inside his passport. Surprise, it's Braille. - That's right. Who would benefit from the death of a man like that? Any suspicions? Gordon Stewart had only an illegitimate daughter. And she's been dead for 22 years. Thank you, Sunny, it was sweet of you. - Don't mention it Such a delightful job doesn't come my way every day. I would like to ask you in for a cup of tea. - Oh, what fun. But with all the excitement I prefer to be alone a while. I'm sure you've got lots of things you want to do. Who would want to invite me for tea at this hour? Why don't you get married, Sunny? I don't seem to get around to it somehow I'm seldom at home, and Scotland Yard, doesn't have a justice of the peace. And Larry? He's had lots of girlfriends, some serious love affairs, but he never seemed to pop the question. - Good night, Sunny. Good night, Miss Ward. Haven't you forgotten something? - Oh, excuse me. I nearly forgot all about it. Would you please hold my hat for me, thank you very much. What are you looking for? Where's the key? - Now where could it be hiding? So foolish of me. I guess, I'm just absent minded. Now, here we are. - I beg your pardon, just my clumsiness. I hope you'll be good enough to forgive me. Oce more, good night, Miss Ward. Good night. Scotland Yard... Is anybody there? No! Nora! What happened? Oh Larry, it was the blind monster. He got away. White delivery van, I couldn't read the license number, but it was probably false. Broken light-bulb... Well Nora, if we can only learn where Blind Jack's hiding place is, we'd know where your aunt is. First Aunt Ella, now it's me. My god Larry, I don't know what would have happened if you hadn't come. But how did you know? Here, this bit of paper saved your life, Nora. You should appreciate it. That's why I'm here, I must find out what the message says. No clearer than the first one. But here, I can read this one. - What does it say? It was no accident, this was a murder. Are you sure? Yes, that's just what's written here. Nora, have you any idea, which of the blind pensioners could have written this? Seems to me there's only one. A little man with a scar on his face. He's called Lou, Lou Norris. Lift out of order DANGER Please wait outside, Sunny, if I need you for anything, I'll call you. Very well, sir. Good evening, Inspector. - Good evening, Jones, what's new? Nothing special, sir. The chap hasn't even shown up. Well, he's bound to show up sooner or later. - I hope so anyway. Now, Mr. Jones, hows everything with the wife and children? Thank you. Everything is just fine, sir. Good evening, Miss Nora. - Good evening. Shall I tell the reverend your here? - Thank you, I know the way. Tell me, is there any other exits to this house. No sir, this is the only one. Reverend Dearborn? Yes. It's me, Nora Ward. Oh, welcome, Miss Ward. Good evening, reverend. Forgive us for coming so late, but I must speak to one of your pensioners. Lou. Oh, Lou. Not Lou Norris? - Yes, the little man with the scar. Oh, now that's most unfortunate. - Why, is he sick? I don't know, it's very strange, he hasn't been home in days. And this morning, I replaced him with someone else. I hope nothing has happened to him. That's something I'll find out immediately. Do you mind if I telephone? Go ahead. Please. - Thank you. Give me the morgue. Hello, doctor, this is Holt. Tell me, have they brought in a body of a man about 5'5". Clearly visible scar on his left cheek. Yes, they brought him in this morning. I must say that's a very accurate description. His name was Lou Norris, address 25 Blossom Lane, the home for the blind. What's the cause of death? He was overrun by a hit-and-run driver. We'll be able to trace the guy, he left some clues. Chips of paint from the vehicle, were found all over the coat of the victim. White? How do I know? I know even more, doctor. For example, it was no accident. It was murder. Too late again... But this is simply dreadful. what you just said, Inspector. I wouldn't want to be alone there at midnight. Would you? I most certainly wouldn't. It's decidedly unpleasant here. Come along, Mr. Jones. Goodnight. Goodnight, Miss Nora. - Goodnight. Oh, there was something I wanted to ask you. Can you write in Braille? No, why do you ask? I just wondered. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight, Miss Nora. - Goodbye Mr. Jones. Goodbye. Good day, Mr. Judd. - Good day. Excuse me. Good day, Mr. Judd. My name is Blake, Matthew Blake. Pardon Your secretary, Mr. Strauss, owes my club considerable sums of money for gambling debts, and he said you would pay all the necessary cash. But that is sheer foolishness who does he think I am? Strauss also made allusions to an affair about a key to Fanny Weldon's apartment. I don't know what you're referring to. However, if you want to pursue the issue, tell my friend Inspector Holt of Scotland Yard Hello Inspector. Hello there Mr. Judd, I was waiting for you. Oh, sorry, I'm a little late. - Inspector. That was Matthew Blake. What? - Was he the one that delayed you? Please Inspector, I don't know him, he's a complete stranger to me. He just came up in the elevator. I must say, I don't care for that weird look in his eyes. No wonder, his left eye is a glass eye. He lost it in a knife battle when he was a prisoner in Dartmoor. How dreadful. Well now, where's your secretary? Mr. Strauss no longer works for me. I had to let him go finally. Can I take your coat inspector? - No, thank you. Well, please be seated. Now then, I suppose you've come about the unfortunate accident to Flea-bite Fred. Unfortunate yes, but not an accident, I'm convinced it's murder. Well, Flea-bite Fred had many enemies - Yes, including you, Mr. Judd. However, you have an air tight alibi. I'd just come in from the street when it happened. I presume I'm not a suspect, Inspector. In any event, I'm visiting you on another case, Mr. Judd. We know that Gordon Stewart drowned in the Thames the other night. He was insured by your company. These drownings in the Thames are my ruin. The big insurance companies now refuse to re-insure for us. You're the first person I've told, Inspector. I'm bankrupt. I've got to dissolve the company. Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Judd. As long as that Stewart policy hasn't been paid yet. Why what do you mean? Of course its been paid. What? The coroners verdict was final, an accident. I made an investigation, as you might expect. But I'm in no position to block the payment and the heiress received the check this morning. The heiress Yes, a certain, Miss Eleanor Finlay. The deceased's illegitimate daughter. Now there could be no question, He had her signature certified by a notary before he died. Here That's completely incomprehensible. Stewart's daughter was called Louisa, she's been dead for 22 years. She was living when she came here this morning. And collected a bank draft for the money, here, see for yourself. The receipt with her signature and her address. 12 Hartford Avenue Now this is really funny, Mr. Judd. How so? - 12 Hartford Avenue is my residence and I'm the only occupant. Chief, I had nothing to do with it. It certainly wasn't my fault. In any case, you let the girl get away twice. In the past you didn't make excuses, you took orders, and carried them out. And will again in the future too. You can't mean it, chief, you can't. I'm not Lou. Chief, I'm not a squealer. If Scotland Yard puts on the pressure, you'll talk all right. No, Chief. They could tear my tongue out, I swear, before they'd get anything out of me. I would die first. - You'll die anyway. No, chief, no. Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Am I dreaming, or is it really you, Miss Nora? Come in. It wasn't easy to find you, Mr. Blake. I suppose you're still a nurse? I'll never be able to forget how you took care of me in the hospital. In the weeks after I lost my eye. It makes me so happy to see you so well. You were always so good to me, Miss Nora. When you were with me, I wasn't just another convict. Remember what you said to me, Matt, when you left prison? I sure do, and it still goes today. I'd do anything in the world for you. Sit down, anything at all. And I have plenty of connections. Now what can I do? Tell me where I can find the hiding place of Blind Jack. But Miss Nora. - I must find it. But, this man is wanted by all Scotland Yard and now you want... They're not looking for him anymore. They finally found him. Blind Jack... where? They found him in a garbage dump. He was shot. If I was you, I'd steer clear of the whole business. I've looked up all the laundries in London, sir. This is the longest laundry list I've ever seen. It'll all come out in the wash, I guess. It breaks my heart, having to go through all that. Anything concrete? - Zero point. Nothing. That's what I thought. Any laundry actually in business, would automatically be eliminated. Unless it's just a front. And the delivery van? - Practically all alike sir... white Yes, white. White like a fresh sheet of paper. We're right back where we started. But if we ever get out of this mess. It'll mean a promotion for both of us - How splendid, sir. Have you plans for Miss Nora's future? - What did you just say, Sunny? Nothing sir, I was merely thinking out loud. And what were you thinking? Well... When you're a Chief Inspector, you can think of it, too, sir. Marriage, you mean? You had better get back to your knitting. Rhombus, about this size. And use nice soft wool. Gladly, sir. Just one thing, sir. Shall I make it blue or else something in the rose shade? Why don't you knit one of each? Sir! Missis Holt. - What? Miss Ward, I'm enchanted, because you telephoned. Yes, I'll pass you to him at once. Hello Nora. What? What did you say? Ella Ward. Who is it? Whose there? Please, please, let me out of here... Good heavens, what are you trying to do? Help! Help! No! Help! No! No! Help Help! Help! Help! Help! Don't worry, we'll get you out. Get into the corner, quickly. The ladder. Come on, this way. Get me out of here. Now tell me something, will you, Mrs. Ward? Who is Nora, and who were her parents? She's an illegitimate child. And her mother was called Finlay, Catherine Finlay. Finlay, but that can't be. She died in childbirth with a child whose name was Louisa. Yes. Both are buried in the Beverley Manor Cemetery. Yes, I was present at the funeral, that was over 22 years ago. However, Cathrine had twins, and only one survived, Louisa died with her mother. And the other little girl, named Eleanor, pulled through. I brought her up as best I could. I adopted her, and she took my name. Ward. - Yes, Ward. So then, Nora is... - Eleanor. And her father is... - Gordon Stewart, a Canadian. 22 years ago, he left Catherine behind and went back to Canada. A half year later, the babies were born, but he knew nothing about all that. Some time ago, Mr. Stewart returned to London again... and he looked me up. Well, I told him he had a daughter alive and well. Mrs. Ward, I must give you a tragic bit of news. Gordon Steward has recently been murdered. - Murdered? And a woman who claims she's Eleanor Finlay has collected the insurance money. At least that's the story we've been told by Steven Judd. Now I suspect that upstanding man, is a rather shady character. And therefore, I want to investigate him and his company. I'll be quite surprised if I don't find something. I mean to do it tonight. Unfortunately, you won't find him there. So much the better. Put up your hands. Put 'em up! If you turn around you're a dead man. Now, go and open the cabinet in the corner. Open it! You heard me. Open it, I said! Open it, or I'll fire! Who are you? What do you want from me? I've only been obeying orders from my superiors, that's all. I don't know anything. I don't know anything! Well, you know too much. You really need not be concerned about your aunt. I've posted a special guard in front of her house. Inspector Holt should have been back long ago. Yes but... Oh, something is wrong. Sergeant Harvey speaking. - A fatal accident or murder in the Greenwich insurance company building. Homicide is on the way. Who is it, do you know? - Unidentified as yet. Larry! - Larry? How can you imagine such a thing, Miss Ward? Do you think the Inspector would sacrifice his pension? Where are you going? - I'm going with you. On the Greenwich case? No, my dear, I can't take the responsibility. I just couldn't go home, I'll be frightened to death. I must find out where Larry is. And I could be of some help. If you really want to help us, please go to the blind home. And observe the janitors behaviour. I'm quite sure there's more to him than meets the eye, Miss Nora. The blind home? What do I care about the janitor? Is this another one of your jokes? My dear, Miss Ward, if I were trying to make a joke this would certainly be an awkward time for it. The double police guard will keep an eye out. I'm not frightened for myself, Sunny. I'm thinking of Larry So am I, Miss Ward. And I promise when I find him I'll inform you immediately. Good evening, reverend. Oh, Miss Ward, wan't you come in, my dear? I didn't expect you to open up, Isn't the janitor here tonight? No, this is his night off... thursdays. Tell me, what's going on. When we spoke on the phone, you were so upset. Yes, Larry Holt has disappeared, and I'm so worried about him. I'm afraid to go home. Excuse me for disturbing you on account of my troubles. Oh, but my dear, you don't disturb me in the least. I'm overjoyed to discover that you have confidence in me. I'm glad you came. Doesn't anybody know where the Inspector went? Yes, He went to search an office building. So far, all we know is that a man was thrown from a window to the street. Whether it was an accident or murder, has not been described yet. Put out the dragnet for Steven Judd. Have a radio description transmitted to Airfields seaports, and to all railway stations. Sergeant Harvey, I believe. - Himself, sir. Why was I not informed as to inspector Holts recent activities? The Inspector didn't want Scotland Yard to be compromised, sir. What do you mean by that? What he was doing was illegal, strictly speaking. He was searching the premises without a warrant, sir. I must insist on discipline on the part of all my supportment. How can I help him? Yes, that's what I'd like to know, sir. Sir. What is it, detective? - I discovered a secret safe, sir. Well, break it open. - Yes, sir. You may stay as long as you wish, you know. Why don't you try to get some rest? Perhaps you should sleep. Sleep, if only I could. My head is bursting. Why don't you try? Nora, go ahead now, You may undress if you like. Whose speaking? Where are you? Never mind, you don't have to answer me. I know who you are now. Who am I? The only man here in this home who has his eyesight. The janitor. How else could you know that I was starting to undress? Sooner or later every criminal gives himself away, just as you did. Come out of your hiding place. I'm not afraid of you. Why are you hiding? Good evening, Miss Nora. I heard your voice... You persist in continuing this comedy, this game you're playing. You're surrounded, the police are outside. It's just a matter of minutes before you'll be arrested. I don't know what you're talking about. You know very well. You were looking through there, just a minute ago. You gave yourself away. You contrived with Blind Jack so he'd commit your murders, and you murdered Lou Norris after he suspected you. You took advantage of the helplessness of the blind to further your criminal schemes. But now there's no way out for you. Your time is up. What a pity, Miss Nora. You made me kill him. You... - Yes indeed All this time you were acting under false pretences. You're not blind. - No, I'm not blind. And you aren't a reverend either. Sorry to disappoint you, Nora. You're in my hands now, Nora Ward. Unless I decide to free you. All those nice policeman out in the street are no help. What's going to happen to me? Nothing terrible, my dear. Don't feel so bad, I want to marry you. - Marry me.. Are you out of your mind? - Not at all. You're an attractive woman, and besides that there's an insurance policy in Canada for half a million dollars in your name. Hasn't anybody informed you that you're the daughter of Gordon Stewart? You murderer. You dirty murderer. You killed my father just in order to collect. Stop. You're even more vicious than Blind Jack. - No question about it. Perhaps you now realise that I under no circumstances will allow any interference. And you will be my wife by midnight. - Never! Don't do anything foolish. Don't take another step. Larry! The reverend. Such a charming couple. The love-birds of the year. Too bad they'll come to such a messy end, Of course it's ugly when the skin burns, Nora. If you touch her, I'll kill you, That's enough... Now, my dear, if you'd said yes, I would have married you, Nora. Why do you want to kill me? What is it you want? I've drawn up a will for you, Eleanor Finlay. It's ready to be signed. In it, you leave all your property to the home of the blind. We need a signature. You'll never get me to sign such a will, never. Don't be so sure, my dear. I'm convinced you will sign it. Do you see that laundry vat? It can be used for a bath or to drown someone without a suspicion or a clue for the police. That's how Lennox died, and Berangari, and Porter. And my father. - Exactly. In a short while you will be suffering the same fate if you don't do as I say. My loyal brother, he thinks of everything. Nothing will be heard above the noise of the pumps and the music. Your brother? - Steven Judd. This respectable minister is none other than David Judd. But David Judd is dead. - Not dead, only buried. We thought it wiser to replace my brother with an old tramp, and put it in the coffin. And the home for the blind to which my brother devotes his efforts was my own invention. The eminent Mr. Steven Judd on the verge of bankruptcy. The Greenwich Company is. But don't worry inspector, our personal funds are safe in South America. Insurance has been paid in full. Oh, by the way, you left a souvenir in my office. Careful next time, its unloaded. Its time, David, our plane is waiting. Did you get Miss Finlay's signature? - Never... no! Nora, if you sign, they'll murder you after it. Think you're smart? ...You cheap punk. Sergeant Harvey. Myself. You're working with Inspector Holt on the blind killer case. Quite right Did you know that Steven Judd was the owner of the home for the blind? Are you sure? Yes, here is the deed of sale. signed by the real estate broker, and Greenwich insurance. Two pieces of property located at Blossom Lane, 25 and 27, with all appliances and buildings. The blind home, Number 27, what kind of a place is it? Now let me see. Number 27 on Blossom Lane. - Yes It's a vacant house, used to be a big laundry establishment, but it was abandoned years ago. Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. Sir! Sir! Blossom Lane number 27. I couldn't have done it alone. - Too bad that we don't have Blind Jack. You will convince her to sign, Holt. - Never! Your naivety can be considered an illness, we'll find a way of fixing that. No! Please! Don't you hear, Inspector? Your fiancee is begging for your help. You'll soon be facing the hangman. Both of you! Just a matter of time now. Let me out, please let me out! Now will you sign it? - No, never! Larry! Again. Look out, David! Come on, let's go. Miss Nora. Thank you, sir. - Quite alright, sir Congratulations Sergeant, you got him in the arm in spite of the distance. That's fine shooting. Sergeant Harvey's the most expert pistol shot in all England. Or haven't you heard about his gold medals. No, nothing but the silver one. Take him away. Thank you, Sunny. You really are a hero. Please, Miss Nora, not one more word. Sergeant, this dropped out of your pocket in the fighting, and I thought you might want to knit yourself a nice warm pair of mittens. He's being funny, Sunny. You're quite a humorist aren't you, you uniformed joker. There's no better method of steadying the hands than taking up knitting. Knit 2 and purl 2. Now, think it over next time you'll feel like laughing. Good night. I've taken the liberty of anticipating in the happy event which is likely to take place in the future Rose coloured for girls, baby blue for boys. Thank you, Sunny. - Your handy work, I presume. Quite right, sir. Well I see you're all here waiting for me. Miss Ward. Please sit down. Miss Ward, Larry, I'd like to be the first to congratulate you both on your engagement. Thank you, Sir John, but we only decided last night. How in the world did you find out? - You know Scotland Yard, always has its special sources of information. We know what's going on. And by the way, Larry, your promotion to Chief Inspector in recognition of your handling of the Judd case is now certain. You'll get word of it this week. - I appreciate it, Sir John. And as far as you're concerned, Inspector Harvey. Excuse me, Sir John, Sergeant Harvey. No, Inspector Harvey, the last ten minutes. Inspe... Forgive me, Sir, I must say this comes as a complete surprise. S Harvey INSPECTOR The End Salvadori777
