You're gonna fall off! This is fun! I'm afraid you're in a red zone. There's your bank parking. - I was just letting my husband out. - I just have to cash a check. I'd appreciate it if you'd let her sit here. I've got this busted ankle. Why don't you let me park the car, you endorse the check and I'll cash it. I'll cash my own check. It's my check. I'm gonna endorse it and cash it myself. He's afraid I'm going to abscond with the money. I don't have to be waited on like some old crock. - Nobody said you were an old crock. - You implied it! Okay. It's okay. You can park here. But please make it quick. Much obliged, Officer. Marry a hippie, and they start endorsin' your checks. George, Adam, 1-7-4-2. What? Plates on that Connie.

Well, it's on a '72 Continental now. The sheriff's on his way. Is that all? Where's the money, mister? That's all there is. It's a very small town, sir. You a good dancer? I don't understand, sir.

May I see your driver's license, please? Oh, certainly. Stop the car! Put down the hood! Stop the car! Look at that, Charley. We creamed 'em. Hot damn! Creamed pig. Get this on the emergency band. There's been a bank robbery over here to Tres Cruces. - Are you all right, Sheriff? - It's a goddamn shambles. Two officers down. We need help. All units. And an ambulance. You got that, Jessie? Yes, sir. The suspects were last seen headin' south in a '72 Continental. Now, that's a yellow four-door with those Colorado plates. There are three occupants. A woman's drivin', and they're armed and dangerous. Over and out, Jessie. Are you sure you're all right, Sheriff? How is he? He's alive anyway. Stick in there, kid. Ambulance will be here in a minute. I got their license! I got their license! G.A. 1-4-7-2. Uh, no, it's G.A. 1-7-4-2. Right! G.A. 1-7-4-2. Thank you. Sheriff, you have blood on your forehead. You're not gonna die, are you? Get along home now, son. Go on. Open up in there. Sheriff Horton. How come the gate's locked? Bust into it. Ow! Keep goin', honey. I'm... I'm... What's the matter, Nadine? Cool it, sweetie. It really hurts. It... really... really hurts. All right. Easy, honey. Easy. All right. Easy. Easy. Atta boy. Easy. Easy. Twenty-eight on the slick. Come on, Charley! We just can't sit here all day. Charley! Easy. All right. We'll get you to a doctor, Nadine. You know him? I should hope not! Well, we'll identify him soon enough. Soon as we get a set of prints. You call the F.B.I. We're not a Federal Reserve bank. They don't have any jurisdiction here. Well, better get a hold of the D.A.'s office then. - Miss Vesta. - Yes? Call the district attorney's office immediately. Yes. Yes. Don't let them delay you. I'll speak to them at once. Get me Maynard Boyle in Reno. I don't care what he's doing, get through to him. Yes, Mr. Young. Charley! Toss it, Charley. Toss it. Careful now, this is black powder. No sweat. I've blown up a lot of gooks with this crap, and I'm still here. Terrific. Yeah. Charley. Tell you one thing. What's that? They're pros. No identification at all. Nothing! Big fat zero. But we're gonna get 'em. They'll never get out of New Mexico. I feel that in my gut. I'm gonna nail those sons o' bitches to the cross. What, honey? She's finished. You know that, don't you? Listen, Charley, you gonna screw around... and some chopper's gonna come and throw a net over us. Charley! Yeah? I... You're right, Harman. She's finished. Yeah. All right. Rig the tank and get the ignitor. I'll finish with the powder. No, I'll finish it. Just one time, surprise me and do what I say. Yeah, yeah, sure. Charley, I can't get a spark. Let's see that. Oh, you got too big a gap here. Yeah. Here, you gotta bring this gap in. See it? All right. Did you rig the tank? Close the doors. Yeah. Get the truck started. Nadine was a hell of a driver, Charley. Yeah, she was. Damn, this tooth of mine is killin' me. Thought you took care of that last week. Yeah, well, I went to that dentist of yours. He did pretty good on me and Nadine. Real fine, Charley. Lots of luck. You know, Nadine once told me that... you and her met in an air circus. Just her and me in an old biplane. What'd ya do? She did wing walking; I did a drunk act. A drunk act? Yeah. I'd come out of the stands dressed like a drunken sailor, wavin' a whiskey bottle. Stagger over to the plane, everybody'd be hollerin', "Stop him! Stop him!" I'd hedgehop around the field a few times... and do a flip over, right in front of the grandstand. - On its back? - Yup. - Crazy, Charley. - Then one day, I nearly got killed and... figured there must be an easier way. Crop dusting. Crop dusting. Yeah. Chance to fly, be independent. Then, of course, we... We couldn't compete with the, uh... The big combines. Right. Yeah. So we got a hold of you and Al Dutcher, decided to see what we could do about some small banks. No trouble. Yeah, no trouble. - Look at that. - What? Up ahead. - Yeah. - Play the harmonica. You know, I used to make my livin' playing this thing. Okay, play it. Professionally. Just relax. Son of a bitch is comin' back this way. What's that for? What do you think? Harman, we're crop dusters. Crop dusters don't wave guns. Put that thing away fast. All right. Okay. Any second now there's gonna be one hell of a bang in that hill. What do we do then? Just play it by ear. Is that how you got to be such a big winner? Don't make any stupid moves. All right, let me tell ya, if he starts snoopin' around in the back, I'm gonna blow his snout off. Hi. Something wrong, Officer? May I see your operator's license, please? You bet. That's me, Charley Varrick. We've been operatin' out of Reese since the first of the year. Thank you very much, Mr. Varrick. You bet. You, uh, mind if I take a look in there? In there? Sure. What's in those drums? In there? Just malathion. Chlordane. Pesticides, insecticides, stuff like that. Herbicides. Have you, uh, been on Tres Cruces Road today? Why? Something happen? We'll get along a lot better if you let me ask the questions, and you answer 'em. You bet. Now, what I want is some information on some people in a yellow '72... Goddamn! Good-bye, Nadine. Wow! I thought I was gonna have to wax that bastard, sure. Your gun, Harman. We're a long way from home free. Give me the piece. I think we, uh, forgot Al Dutcher's gun. Let's go. Nadine? We're home, Nadine. Nadine? Get that stuff inside. Hello, Mrs. Taff. Hello. Didn't see my wife, did you? No, I didn't see her all day today. But I'll keep me eye peeled. Thank you. That's very kind of you, Mrs. Taff. Oh, just common courtesy. Oh, you don't suppose she's run off, do ya? No, ma'am, I don't think so. Well, ya never can tell. There's mashers all around this place, you know. - They're after me all the time. - Yes, ma'am. - Just don't get any ideas! - No, ma'am. The milkman's the worst. I make him leave his yogurt on the stoop, and I don't bring it in until after he's gone. That's good thinking.- Excuse me. That's mine. It's probably an obscene phone call. Oh, dear! Listen, you don't have any whiskey around here, do you? I'll get you some. I don't want you getting loaded. Ah, this damn tooth of mine won't quit. Still hurts, huh? Here, open up that other sack. Hot damn! Sweet! Charley. Charley, come here. Come here, Charley. Charley, come here! Quick! Charley, look at this money. Will you just look? This... Lookit. Fifty-dollar bills and hundred-dollar bills. Charley, we done hit the giant, big daddy jackpot. Oh, Lord! What's the matter? You're not gonna tell me it's counterfeit, are you? - No, it's good. - Oh, money! Money, money, oh, money! Oh, Lord! Do you know these are all one hundred dollar bills? - How much money you reckon we got here? - I don't know. Uh, half a million? - Could be. - What's bothering you? I don't know. Something smells bad. Charley. You smell bad. Don't run a game out on me, or I'll hang you out to dry. What's that kind of money doing in the Tres Cruces bank? Where should it be? Bank that size figures to have... maybe thirty... twenty thousand dollars. Let me ask you one question. The money was there, right? - Yeah. - Now it's here, right? So what's the big deal? We interrupt this program with another late bulletin... about the Tres Cruces bank robbery in which there are three known dead... and one sheriff's deputy still in critical condition. Harold Young, bank manager, has estimated... that the bandits escaped with less than $2,000. Sheriff Horton of San Miguel County predicts an early arrest. Two? And now, back to your program. - What the hell was that about? - I don't know. Who are they kiddin'? Us? Don't they think we can count? Doesn't make any sense unless... - Unless what? - Unless it's a drop. What's a drop? You know what dirty money is: money you can't declare on your income tax. When certain people get that money, they send it out of the country to invest. When it comes back, it's clean. So? Maybe that little bank was a drop, a collection point. Maybe all this was on its way out of the country. Fantastic! We lucked out! More like crapped out. It's 10-to-1 this stuff belongs to the Mafia. This is gambling money, skimmed off the top. Whore money. Dope money. - What's the difference? - The difference is that the Mafia kills you. No trial. No judge. They never stop looking for you, not till you're dead. I'd rather have ten F.B.I.'s after me. Mafia money. All I wanted was a small take, in and out quick, no big deal. Don't worry. If you don't want your share, I'll be happy to take it over for you. - I'm sure you would, Harman. - You want to give it back? I've been thinkin' about it. Charley Varrick. Well, I got some news for you, Charley. You haven't got the balls of a bull canary bird. And something else! I ain't givin' back penny number one! Neither am I. Then what are we arguing about? Wouldn't do any good to give it back. Nobody takes the Mafia for this kind of money and lives. They would have to set an example. They got to find us. That's not as hard as it sounds. Word goes out, and every two-bit hustler is lookin' to turn you in. Yeah, the Cosa Nostra's everywhere. You better believe it. I believe this! We're gonna have to keep pretty quiet for a while. That so? Right. Best way to get nailed is start tossin' that stuff around. What's your idea of "a while"? Three years. Maybe four. Are you tellin' me I can't spend this for four years? Right, and lay off that juice too. That's another way to get nailed. Me along with ya. Any more instructions? No! Nothin' more you want to hang on to me? Not right now. Then I got somethin' I want to hang on to you, Jimmy Dick! I've been waitin' all my life to make a score like this, and now that it's here, I ain't waitin' no more. I mean, I'm gonna whale! And I'm talkin' about chicks, cars, clothes, a box at the races and beefsteak three times a day; and no washed-up, chicken-shit, son of a bitch had better try to stop me. Okay, kid, you're callin' it. Miss Fort, I want a messenger to hand-deliver an item. Bastard. This morning, a Western Fidelity branch bank in Tres Cruces, New Mexico, was robbed of roughly three-quarters of a million dollars. The size of the take plus the urgency of the situation... makes it inevitable that I should call upon you to become personally involved. All the arrangements will be the same as the last time. I hope and fully expect the same kind of results. I know you realize... the extraordinary concern here at this end, so please expedite. Good luck. So sorry, please. Not open. I'm here to see Honest John. Not here, please. Try some other time. - I'm Molly. - Oh, Mr. Molly, I'm sorry. Right this way. Yeah? Mr. Molly to see you, sir. Door's open. Good to see you, Molly. No! Oh, lucky shot! I told you, you should have given me more points. Ah! Pleasure to do business with you, Murph. Thank you, creep. Next time, ten points. Sucker! Come on in, Molly. - What's the setup? - Our sources haven't had time to come up with anything yet. But the word's out. Something will break. It always does. - Was that it? - What else can I tell ya? Thanks anyway, Honest John. What's that for? Well, you can tell our friend I don't work with my head in a bag. Wait a minute. I don't get it. How long was that roughly three-quarters of a million dollars to be in that bank? A couple of days. And who knew it was there? Harold Young. He's the branch manager out there. He knew, of course. Anyone else? Undoubtedly, Maynard Boyle. If you should find there's some sort of leak... inside the organization, that information would be very valuable. Carte blanche? No restriction. The lid's off. Very well. Do you have any connections in New Mexico? No. You'll be all right here. They'll also take and deliver messages. What about transportation? A maroon Chrysler Imperial. Clean. All souped up. Do 140 on a straightaway. Guaranteed. Sounds reasonable. It's all yours, but there's a problem. It's a repossession. That's no problem. Let's go! There it is. Hey! Hush, sonny. You're gonna get your bran' new puppy. Didn't I promise ya? Didn't I? Hey, mister. I don't want no problems. I'm askin' you in a very nice way to keep your hands off that automobile. - You Randolph Percy? - You caught me on a bad day, so stay out of my face! You owe six months' payment. I owe? I owe, huh? That Chink son of a bitch burned me out of $2,500, and I told him when I get my money, he gets his car. Look, I'm repossessing the vehicle. You pink-assed punk, you! I allow very few men to speak to me in that tone. A few Caucasians. But no Negroes at all. Hey, Harman! Yeah? Ten o'clock news is about to come on. You said you wanted to see it. Damn straight, I do. All right, come on. It's my favorite program. Current events and all that. Current events used to be my favorite subject in school. Hey, Charley, I bet you don't know what the capital of West Virginia is. Charleston. Charleston's right. Where's the money? It's in there. In the closet. - You count it? - Yup. How much? $765,118 even. I thought I'd never live to see that much money... Never mind have it for my own. One-third. - Huh? - One-third is yours. Two-thirds is mine. Sure, good buddy. Sure. That's what I meant. We're missin' the news. Negotiations continue on a 24-hour basis. Union spokesmen say a final solution to the disagreements with city officials... appears to remain several days away. At this hour, a brush and timber fire continues to smolder six miles south of Tres Cruces, in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristos. About 1,000 acres have burned in the fire, but authorities say it is now under control. And there appears now to be a definite link between the fire... and this morning's bank robbery in Tres Cruces. A car, apparently used by the bandits in their getaway, remained at the scene of the fire. Inside the car, on the front seat, authorities found a body... believed to be the remains of a woman who was driving. Earlier today, our man at the Tres Cruces bank spoke to Sheriff Bill Horton. Well, uh, this here... This here body that we found... is, uh, too badly burned for any kind of identification, except for the teeth. We've circularized every dentist in the state with the dental work. Of course, we've got every bus station and railroad depot and airport covered. All the roads and the highways are blocked. These people are not gonna make it out of New Mexico... Not alive... that I promise you. In Albuquerque today, a threatened strike of city bus drivers... You know, Charley? You're just plain lucky. How do you figure? Because you're valuable. You know how to fly an airplane, and we're gonna get into that airplane and sail right over them roadblocks. What do you think? Where we gonna land? They'll have every airport covered. In Mexico? Especially in Mexico. At every landing field. We're not gonna land in any landing fields. You're gonna land us in a place where they never even thought of looking. I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Ain't you supposed to be some kind of hot dog stunt pilot? It's been a long time since I've done any fancy flying, and you lose your knack. Well, you better find it again in a hurry. 'Cause if you can't do that, Jimmy Dick, what use are you? We'd have to rig an auxiliary gas tank on that. Give us some cruising range. Now you're cookin', Charley. First thing we'll have to do is get the charts. - What charts? - Nadine's dental charts. The X-rays. It's the only way they have of identifying her. I'll have to get 'em. You got another jug around here? Yeah, there's one in the chest of drawers in the bedroom. - Don't leave the trailer. - Don't leave the trailer. Don't leave the trailer, Harman. Charley, you worry too much. No such thing as worrying too much... Not when you got the fuzz and the Mafia after you at the same time. How long you reckon it's gonna be before they stop lookin' for us? The fuzz'll quit pretty soon. The others never stop, not unless they think you're dead. No washed-up, chicken-shit, son of a bitch... had better try to stop me! I painted her up her belly and down her back every crevice and every crack I painted her painted her through and through and I painted her old tomato red, white and blue Come here, puppy. Come on. Come here. Hello. Hello. What do you say, huh? What do you say? Vicious. I'm Molly. I'm Jana. These are the goodies. He says his name is Sally. Molly. Sally, Molly. If you got a bell, honey, we'll find a way to ring it. I didn't travel 600 miles for the amusement of morons. - Is that clear, ladies? - Now, just a darn minute! You just keep throwing your feathers, mister, before I put you in a hospital. Yes, sir. Are you the gentleman we've been expecting? My name is Molly. I'm Beverly. Anything you want, name it. A good bed. Right. I've reserved Sin Bin for you. All right, girls. You can sit down now. Follow me, please. This is where my girls relax when they're not working. They, uh, write letters, watch television, play cards. Mr. Conforte, I'll see you in just a few minutes. Okay, honey. Take good care of this man. Yes, we will. This way, please. Hey, that's good. There's no charge for anything, of course. No water beds? I'm sorry. We have everything else. When I wake, I'd appreciate two, three-and-a-half-minute eggs, a piece of dry whole wheat toast and a pot of hot herb tea. Okay. If there's anything we can do for your pleasure, Jana's a nice girl. I don't sleep with whores... At least, not knowingly. Well, like they say, "Different strokes for different folks." Yeah. Come on, Jana. Lover Throw me over, lay me down and do it again Throw me over in the clover Throw me over, lay me down and do it again Throw me over in the clover Throw me over, lay me down and do it again Throw me over in the clover Charley! Charley! Oh! Charley! Charley! Hey, mama. You... You seen Charley Varrick? Well... Damn! Huh? I've been reading your newspaper about that awful robbery. Where? You seen Charley Varrick? He left early in the truck, lookin' for that wife of his. Shit! Varrick? I'm in Reese, trying to run down a fitting. Fitting? For the auxiliary gas tank. Remember? Anyway, there's a guy in Shoemaker who's got one. I'm goin' over there. How's your tooth? The hell with my tooth! Where's the goddamn money! It's in a safe place. I couldn't leave it with you dead to the world, could I? Seen the papers? Got a copy right here. This picture of Al bothers me. It's not that good, but somebody might just pick up on it. You better stay there in case I need you fast. I can't go very far! You gonna tell me what you did with the money? Not over the phone. I've got a million things to do. There's another pint in the cupboard. Stay put, and I'll see you tonight. You better, man! Hi, you Tom? Yeah. Well, I mentioned to Al Dutcher that I might need a special kind of a favor someday, and he, uh, he said you had connections. Al Dutcher? Uh, small, thin, kinda nice-lookin' bird? No. Tall, husky, ugly-lookin' bird. What do you want? I need some paper, quick. I don't sell paper. I make my livin' sellin' guns. I need two passports. Al said if you didn't handle something, you'd know somebody who did. - Dutcher. - Dutcher. Where am I supposed to know this guy from? From Joliet. He was doin' a ten-year slide for murder two. His girlfriend. Armenian girl. Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. Five bills. Five bills? Isn't that a little high? Just went to six. Wanna bargain, buy yourself a rug. Okay, okay. Six hundred dollars. Right. Two, three, four, five, six hundred. Yeah, even money. There is the little beauty. One-ninety... How do you say that? Ara... Arapahoe. Arapahoe Street. Yeah. About a half-mile down, turn to the right. Thank you very much. All right. Oh, uh... Anything else? There might be something else. I might want to fence off some money. - Hot? - Burning up. - Consecutive serial numbers? - No, nothing like that. But I wouldn't be surprised if there was some sort of a record. - Hmm. How much money we talkin' about? - A lot. - A whole lot? - A whole lot. Where can I get in touch with you? Well, I'll be here and there. Maybe I better get in touch with you. All right. Okay. Yeah? There's a phone call for you. You ready for breakfast? I don't know yet. I'll tell you later. Okay. Shut the door on the way out. Righto. Yeah? Hello, Molly? Honest John here. We've got a lead for you in Albuquerque. Tom's Gun Shop. He's expecting you. Yeah. Tom's Gun Shop, right. Incidentally, Maynard Boyle flew over to New Mexico this mornin'. He's stayin' at the Travel-On-In Motel in Kendrick. Make a note of that. May I help you, sir? My name is Maynard Boyle. I'm president of Western Fidelity. This is our bank. I'm here to see Harold Young. He's our branch manager. I'll tell Mr. Garfinkle you're here, Mr. Boyle. Excuse me. Just a minute. It's Young. Harold Young. He's the one I want to see. Not Garfinkle. Sir, the district attorney's office is in charge of this investigation. You'll need Mr. Garfinkle's permission to see him. Now excuse me, please. Mister, would you please push me? Sure. What's your name? Holly. Sir? Mr. Boyle? What's your kitty's name? Sam. This is Mr. Garfinkle. You got any brothers and sisters? Yes. How many? One brother and one sister. What's your business inside, Mr. Boyle? My business is I want to see Harold Young. Afraid that's impossible right now. Why is it impossible? Is he under arrest? No, he's not under arrest. In that case, I'd like to see him. I've flown from Reno especially for that purpose. Mr. Young is making an audit. I'm sure you'll understand. I assure you, I do not understand. Now, why am I being denied access to my own premises? Well, it's a matter of priority. First and foremost, this is a murder investigation. My business is purely financial. Well, you're very lucky so far, Mr. Boyle. All we've found missing is about $1,300. Well, if you're a nice fellow, nice things happen to you. So I hear. Now, uh, where can you be reached? I'm at a motel in Kendrick... The Travel-On-In. I'll have Mr. Young get in touch with you as soon as he's free. Mr. Finkle? Garfinkle. Is Harold Young under suspicion? Suspicion of what? Suspicion of collusion in robbery. Please don't talk down to me. Now, uh, anybody could be under suspicion, Mr. Boyle. We're still at the stage where questions are being raised. Now, if you'll excuse me. - Bye, Holly. - Good-bye, mister. Yeah? Hi. Hi. Uh, are you the photographer? Yeah, that's right. A man in a wheelchair gave me this. Come in. Just step right in there. What is it that you wanted? I need two passports in a hurry. Yeah. Everybody's in a hurry. Got any pictures? No. No. Okay, over there. Sit down on that stool, if you will. What it'll cost you'll be 250 apiece. That's 500 all told. That's in advance. No offense, but people who need passports in a hurry are generally in trouble. You get shot between now and then, I get stuck. You understand? Yeah. It's okay. I wouldn't want you to take a loss. Oh, gee. How soon can you have them? Ah, you need two of them? Yes, one for me and one for my friend. I can let you have 'em in, uh, two days. Two days. On a rush order, it'll cost you extra. You'll have to do better than that. Are you kidding? You know what's involved? This is not digging potatoes, you know? How soon can your friend be in to have his picture taken? He can't. I was hoping maybe you could use this. That the way you want to look? It's his driver's license. Harman Sullivan. That's the name you want to use? Yeah. Can you use that? Sure, I can dupe it. Have you any idea what kind of work is involved? I'm gonna have to work day and night. Pose. And that's gonna cost you 500 extra. - Five hundred dollars? - Five hundred dollars. What do you get for a glass of water? I'll tell you what. I'll give you the other five hundred, but I gotta have both passports by 6:00 tonight. Mmm. Tomorrow. The absolute outside. Split the difference. Twelve midnight. The things I do for a handsome man. Well! Thanks very much. Thank you very much. All right, here's the information you'll need for both the passports. You got the names and the hair, eyes, height... that stuff. Charley Varrick, Reese River Mobile Homes... that's my address. My telephone number is right down here, okay? Here's my card, in case you lose that. See you at midnight. Uh, Mr. Varrick, you sure this money's good? People kill each other for that kind of money. Can I use one of your suckers? Cost you an extra 500. Close the outside door on your way out, okay? You got it. I got it. I'm Molly. Oh. Well. What I have for you is special information. Cost me a lot of money. I gotta get somethin' for it. You're going to earn a great deal of... goodwill. I got all the goodwill I need. If you wanna know what I know, get some cash on the counter. Now sit there and start talkin' with goodwill. I don't suppose that they could get a bug in my motel room or your car this fast, but it never hurts to be careful. They'd have to get a court order first. Court order? To install a listening device. I'm not talking about that little bagel snapper from the district attorney's office. What does he call himself? Garfinkle. Garfinkle. He should change his name. You know something, Harold? I never thought I'd be willing to change places with a cow. A cow? Those things out there. They are cows, aren't they? I don't understand the thrust of your comment. Take a look at them. They've got it knocked. What's the worst thing that could possibly happen to them? A short circuit in the electric milker. Compared to what I'm facing, that's child's play. Are you talking about the Las Vegas people? I'm in trouble, Harold, and it's my own damn fault. They're gonna ask me why did I pick this particular bank. And believe me, from where I'm sitting, it looks damn peculiar. Surely they don't suspect you. I'm on the list, Harold, and it's a very short list. You and I are the only ones who knew the money was gonna be in the bank. Then they suspect me too. Yeah. Good God, Maynard. You don't think I had anything to do with it? Of course not. I-I'm not an ambitious man. I don't need very much. I've been very happy here in Tres Cruces. I've become a part of the community, and people appreciate not just the day-to-day business of banking, but the way I've restored the bank. I've made it a part of the living historical heritage of the community. For the first time in my life I found a place that I love. Why would I jeopardize that? I believe you, Harold. I only hope they do when the time comes. We might as well face it, they're gonna ask questions. For instance, we've been keeping various sums in the bank from time to time. But the one time we really load up... Bang, this horseshit bank... a million miles from nowhere gets hit by four professionals! They're gonna think that's strange! A coincidence. Just a coincidence. They do happen, you know. Yeah. But it's odd that you made no effort... to get the police... That you just trotted right over, opened the vault. There really wasn't anything else I could do. Oh, no? You could have fainted. I had a gun at my head, don't you understand? I understand perfectly. I am not a physically courageous man, Maynard. It's our Mafia friends that won't understand. They're gonna wonder why you led them directly to the vault with the money... instead of the empty vault in the rear. And frankly, Hal, why did you do that? Do you know what would've happened if I had taken those people to an empty vault? Number one, the money would've been saved; number two, there'd be no question of an inside job! Inside job? That's the way their diseased minds work. A bank gets it... bang, they look for a double-cross. Why couldn't it be just a coincidence? Because they don't believe in coincidence! I don't know what to do. Take a look at the big brown one out there. Man, what a set of jugs! You need a rest, Harold. A long trip to someplace quiet. Another name, another country. I can't start my life over again. You don't have much choice, Harold. They're gonna try to make you tell where the money is. You know what kind of people they are. They'll strip you naked and go to work on you with a blowtorch. Oh, my God. If you need money, Harold, I can help. That's what I call a hell of a lock. I'm Molly. Yeah, I didn't figure you for Clint Eastwood. Which one is this? Charley Varrick. That's the other one. Harman Sullivan. Don't keep that. It's the only picture Varrick gave me of him. When will he be coming by to pick these up? Midnight. Much obliged. And by the way, did the gentleman say where he might be reached... in case something came up? Yeah, he gave me that. "Reese River Mobile Homes. Charley Varrick, last of the independents." I like that. Has a ring of finality. Mr. Varrick! Charles Varrick? He's not in there. Are you lookin' for his wife? Uh, no. I'm here on business. Maybe Mr. Sullivan can help you. He's in there. Ah, thank you, ma'am. What do you want? I need some crops dusted. Lookin' for Charles Varrick. He ain't here. Gosh, I won't be able to come back tomorrow. I was wonderin' if I might leave my card with you. I'd appreciate it. I... can't seem to be able to find one. So dark out here. Would you mind if I came inside? I'll scribble where he can reach me. Thank you. Sure sorry I disturbed you. I take it you're Mr. Sullivan, huh? Mr. Harman Sullivan? Yeah, yeah. That's right. Agh! Sooner or later you're gonna tell me everything you know. So why not save yourself a great deal of pain? Tell me now. Harman? Where's the money? Jesus Christ. You... busted my ribs. Let's try it this way. Where's Charles Varrick? - I don't know. - He left you to take the heat? Is that it? That's... That's what he did. Exactly what he did. Dirty bastard. One thing that puzzles me. If he was gonna leave you behind, why have a passport made for you? Huh? Oh, you didn't give Varrick your driver's license? My wallet's right there in my shirt. Can I show you? Sure. It's gone! Surprise, surprise. Agh! Now, don't insult my intelligence, boy. That could be a grave error. I swear to God, I don't know what you're talkin' about. I'm askin' you nicely. Where's the money? Charley's got it. God, he was so scared, 'cause I wanted to give it back. You wanted to give the money back? Yeah. Why? Why did you want to give the money back, Harman? Uh, because... Huh? 'Cause it's... Mafia money, that's what... Oh. How did you know that? Charley told me. Who told Charley? - Huh? - Who fingered the job? Was it Young? Hmm? Uh... I... I don't know. Ah. Young doesn't have the balls for a deal like that. It was Boyle, wasn't it? I wish I did know, man. My patience is wearing thin. If I don't get some satisfaction from you soon, I'm gonna start hurting you very badly. Where's Varrick? I don't know, man. Where's the money? I don't know. Sonny boy, you and I are just not communicating. Evenin', sheriff. Evening. Mr. Garfinkle has been expecting you, sir. Run a check on these, will you, Nick? Harold, you all right? Oh, first-rate, Bill. First-rate. Just that I don't like strangers in my bank when I'm not here. Ah. Well. Would you mind closing the door? How are things progressing, Bill? Well, I been thinkin'. Two of 'em drive up in a Connie, right? Right. But there's two already inside the bank waitin'. Now, how'd they get here? Do you think maybe there's an abandoned vehicle near... Sheriff Horton! He said the car's been here ever since the robbery. - Right. - Here. - What is it? - For what it's worth. Matches. "Reese Lanes"... Hell, that's it! This case is breakin' wide open. I'll get that bastard if I have to ring every doorbell in Reese. Come on, Van. Dave, you and Henderson stay with the car. Let me know if you find anything. Everybody else, let's move it! You called it, kid. Who's there? Molly. I told you I wouldn't be finished 'til midnight. So we'll kill an hour or two. You haven't heard from Mr. Varrick? No, not yet. May I use your telephone? Yeah, make yourself at home. Say, you wouldn't have a beer for a thirsty man, would you? I'll look and see. Beverly, it's Molly. I'm in Albuquerque at 242-5325. Okay. Thank you. Varrick? We got a warrant for your arrest. Either you come out or we're comin' in. All right, everybody, you stand fast and keep us covered. And don't anybody get careless. I could've told you nobody was home. Will you sign for the dynamite, please? Sign for the dynamite, right? Right. Gotta sign for everything these days. I guess so. Dynamite, time delay cap, mercury switch and emergency compartment light. One, two, three and four. Anything else? That's it. That's nine dollars even. All right. There you go. Out of ten. Yeah. Wouldn't happen to have the time? My watch is slow. It's 8:47. 8:47, right. I'll put that in a bag. That's okay. I don't need a bag. Thank you. May I ask what that's for? Oh, you certainly may. No, no. I wanna talk to Mr. Boyle. What is it about, please? This is the main office of Western Fidelity Banks, isn't it? Yes. Yes, it is. And Mr. Boyle is the president of the chain? And I'm his executive secretary. Now, how can I help you, please? You can't. I have to see or talk with Mr. Boyle himself. Mr. Boyle is out of town, but if you leave a number where you can be reached, he'll... What is your name, please? Miss Fort. - Fort? - Yes, sir. Hey, kid! Hey, kid! - Bring all your roses. - All of 'em? All of them. Atta boy. Twenty okay? Sure! Thank you. Thank you. Oh, Miss Fort. Good evening. A gentleman brought some flowers for you. You might like to have them. What gentleman? I don't know. He didn't leave his name. I thought you would know him. Good night. Good night, Arthur. Good evening, Miss Fort. Hi. Good evening. How are you tonight, William? Fine. Thank you. - Who is it? - Flowers. What do you want? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Which doesn't mean I won't throw you right out that window if I have to. I'm not scared. What do you want? I wanna see Boyle. Kendrick Bar. Hello. I'd like to speak to a Mr. Maynard Boyle, please. Is there a Mr. Boyle in the house? Be right there. Hello. Hello? Hello. This is Sybil. How pleasant to hear your voice, Miss Fort. I assume this call is important. If you consider three-quarters of a million dollars important. What about it? I have a gentleman here who wants to give it back to you. Is he alone? Yes, he's alone. Put him on. Thank you. Hello, Boyle? Who is this? Charley Varrick. I got something I want to give back to you. - How is it packaged? - In two canvas bags with the name stenciled on the front. So give them back. What's your problem? The problem is the big gorilla in the maroon car is trying to kill me. - I'm listening. - I want your word that once these are delivered, that's the end of it... No reprisals. So you want to meet with me. Alone. No hit man. - Where? - Ten miles north of Reese, on State Highway 23. There's a big automobile junkyard there and an airstrip that crop dusters use. Ten miles north of Reese... on State Highway 23. Tomorrow morning. When I fly in I want to see you standing there alone. What time in the morning? Just be there early. About a quarter of a mile down the strip, past the hangar. If there's anybody within 500 yards, forget it. Kiss the money good-bye. Got it? I'll see you in the morning. Charley Varrick? Yeah. I'm gonna tell you something. I-I guess I shouldn't. I-I wouldn't trust him if I were you. I like your bed. You may find this hard to believe, but I've never slept on a round bed. Is that so? What's the best way? North, south, east or west? Depends on what you had in mind. What I had in mind was boxing the compass. Oh, uh... You better not be there. Why not? If there's anyone around for 500 yards, the deal is blown. So I'll be 501 yards. Just don't be there. Look at me I've learned to grow but I'm somebody that I don't know I now you'll say I told you so you warned me just what I'd be goin' through That's nice. That you'd make a memory out of me My wife's wedding ring. You're an interesting man, Mr. Varrick. Go to sleep, Miss Fort. "Last of the Independents." Go to sleep. You know I have to be up early. Don't get killed. I'll try not to. Go to sleep, please. You'd twist and turn You still owe me south by southwest. Then will you go to sleep? We'll see. What's done is done but somehow deep inside I always knew South by southwest. But I couldn't face the future without you I think it's this way. Hey, nice timing. We did it. We pulled it off! Ha! What the hell you talking about? We did it! We did it! What're you doing? What is this? Hey! Get... Hey! Ah! Son of a bitch! Ooh! Wow. Whew! Hey. You're a hard man to reach. I... I'll make a deal with you. Ah, you're hardly in any position to make a deal. Smell that gasoline? I bet this thing would burn in a hurry. I know where the money is. You'll never find it without my help. Your end is what? Just help me out of here and let me go. - Where's the money? - We got a deal? The money first. Get the keys out of my pocket. I can't move my arm. Now, you see that blue Chevy over there? Yeah. The money is in the trunk. I'll be back. Agh!
