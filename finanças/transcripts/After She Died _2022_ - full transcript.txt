...washing down, or something, anything! - This shit every fucking day! - Oh! You think we're in this place if it wasn't for me? Don't act like you could afford this house all on your own. If it wasn't for me, you'd be evicted in a week. Guys! Can you shut up? I have an exam tomorrow. Sorry. We're sorry. We'll try to be quiet. Jen. Jen, can I come in? Yeah. From dust you came and dust you shall return. Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior shall rise you up on your last day. Lord God, our Father in heaven, have mercy on us. At the moment of death and our last day, save us. Merciful and gracious, your God. I can't believe you're making me miss the actual burial. Do you know how selfish that is? I ask you for one day, Dad. Just don't put the funeral on this one day. Look, it's starting. Could you just stop here? What? Now I can't come with you? Just meet me in there. All right? Look, it's starting. - You guys have heard the new rumor, right? - New rumor? About Principal Crandall. - Okay, so Jackie saw her at the gym. - Don't feed - into his bullshit. - Hup-hup-hup-hup-hup! Hey, let me have this. Apparently, her body is like mangled like Frankenstein's monster or some shit. - Oh, yeah? Says who? - Says me. Yeah. I was watching, the, that whole speech, you know, - trying to spot the scars... - The whole speech, really? Yeah, yeah. Don't look at me like that. Remind me why we hang out with you again. You know that weird swelling sensation - you get when you see me? - Fear? - Ah, that's love. - No. - Yeah. - Hey, Jen. You're coming to the party tonight, right? - No, she's not. - What? - She's lame. - Oh, boo! You suck. You gotta be coming to Nathaniel's on Friday then. Um... Uh, she's gonna say it. - Don't say it. - She's gonna say it, a 100 percent. Maybe. Hey, given the opportunity, I'd ditch these two idiots as well. Jen, ignore Ash. You're coming. You can't leave me alone. Uh, alone. You have me. Please. The day you get in my pants is the day the world ends. Cameron. Well, I'm gonna go Wait. We're doing tomorrow, yeah? Tomorrow? Oh. Yeah, yeah. No, of course. Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you. I didn't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. I know, but... I'm so sorry. I'm so fucking sorry. It was all for nothing, wasn't it? I'll meet you in the car. How do you afford all of this? - Well, the records. - Mm. I have a job, Jen. Did you know about that thing called employment, right? No. Do you want to tell me about it? Hey, I think I'm gonna move out. What, why? 'Cause I got in. You got in? Yeah. Sydney Uni. Oh, my God. That, that... That's great. Um... Louis is gonna miss you. Unless he's going with you as well. Please, not you too. Yeah, don't worry. My dad still thinks he's my secret boyfriend. Have you told your mom yet? - Not exactly. - Good luck. She'll chain me up in my room before she lets me leave. Yeah. You should look into it. What? Chaining you up? No. Getting out of town. Yeah, I don't know. Haven't really looked at unis yet. - It's been hard. - You should. Might have an actual life, right? You're better than this town. We all are. Hey. You wanna see what I got? Ta-da. You want some? When did you start smoking? Mmm. Since Ash is, which surprise, surprise. You went up. You know. She's moving to Sydney Uni, too. So, at least, I'll have one friend. - Ash is going to Sydney Uni? - Yeah. Well, I didn't think you two were close. Hey, can you open the window? Sure. Sure you don't want some? No. Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that? Dad. Jen. I thought you're at Cameron's. I was. But the fires... Are you? Yeah, but... It's, it's all under control. It's fine. We're good. Actually... Uh... There's somebody I'd like you to meet. Jen. This is my girlfriend, Florence. What? Hi, Jen. It's nice to meet you. I don't understand. Wh... I'm sorry to spring this on you, but well, shit. I don't know what to say. Florence is going to be living with us for a while. The fires did some damage, some serious damage in Florence's house. She has nowhere else to go. Oh, Jen. Are you okay? You're looking sick. John, get a chair. Jen, sit, you okay? So, Jen, are you, you just graduated? Ah, yeah. That's exciting. It's when everything starts to really make sense, you know, Have you applied for unis yet? Ah, no. I don't know yet. Not yet. How come? Because she's the most indecisive person I know. As she spent so long weighing her options, she ends up breaking the scales. Sounds like her father. Yeah, but seriously, what did your teachers say you're going to be? A scientist, right? Microbiologist. But just because he says that doesn't mean I actually want to do that. They teach that around here? - I think so. - Not really. Well, I could never really get into science. Florence majored in hospitality, and she's a great musician, too. Actually, you both play the piano, right? - Maybe you could play it together sometime. - Definitely. No. I'm good. Well, I like the sounds of a microbiologist. That's far more impressive than a firefighter, that's for sure. Hey. You see how many fires there been around you? And have you seen how much a scientist makes in a year? You know, Jane volunteers down at the shelter sometimes. We thought, what's his name? That boy? - Louis. - Right. Louis. A "friend." Oh, Dad. Why do you always think we're dating? I'm just saying. No, you're assuming. He's the only guy in your life. Can I get a break from wanting you to be happy? No, you can't. Okay, we... He's just my friend. That's it. Oh, Florence. - If you ever want to help down there... - Dad. - What? At the shelter? - Yeah. Oh, what a great idea. - When are you there next? - Tomorrow. You and Jen can go out together. - You can help at the shelter... - Dad, I'm sure she has much better things to waste her time... We could do it together like a real family. Don't call us that! I... It's okay. I think that went well. Excuse me. Of course. Oh, come on, come on. Please, please, please, please, please. Pick up. Louis. You're home late. I, uh... Use your words. Have you gone full retard on me? How was graduation? That was like two days ago, Dad. Huh, yeah, right. Friends left you yet? Should they have? After high school, then you find out who your real friends are. - Hello. - Jen. Cameron. Cameron, are you okay? Jen, I don't know if you can hear me I'm just gonna talk, but... Yeah, I'm here. I'm at my Grandma's. Fires... pass... and... Help me... get back. Is she okay? Cameron, are you there? Have a good day. I'll see you tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dad! Dad! Dad! Wait! Dad, wait! Where are you going? I'm going to work. I have a piano lesson. Okay? Ah. Shit. All right. Sorry, I was meant to give you a lift. Yeah. I can take her. Are you sure? Of course. If that's okay with you, Jen? Sure. That settles it. See you both tonight. Dad. Is it her? Is she Mom? Nothing can replace your mom. - You don't mind if we speak in... - Uh... No. That was good, Jen. One note doesn't take away from the whole song. You just need to practice at home. Invest in a keyboard. Anything. Jen? Are you okay? Yeah. Um... Can... Can we do this again? I just want to get it right this time. Here's your blanket. - Do you reckon will ever get Cameron down here? - Hmm. Doubt it. Ooh! Maybe we can burn her house down. I, I am so sorry for your loss. Yo, Louis! Come on. - Coming. - Jen. Hey. Just line 'em up. Li... Line these up like me. - Excuse me. - I fell like more abstract... - No, no, no, no, no. - Excuse me, - do you work here? - Line these up. I saw her do. Um, I've just arrived and I'm not sure what I should do. Yeah, Regis... registration's at the front. - No. - Oh, no. I'm a volunteer. Okay, I'll bring in, bring in. Oh, my bad. Why don't you hand these out there? What did you say your name was? I'm Florence. I didn't know you volunteered here. Ah! Yeah, my dad makes me volunteer. That sounds really bad. I... I like volunteering. I am gonna shut up now. Why are you so awkward? Ouch. No, don't. I... I like awkward. Jen. Bitch, you fucking bitch! - Look what you did... Fucking did to me! - I was just... Look what you just fucking did to my finger! - Look, what you just fucking did! - I was just doing what you said. - Fuck! That's not what I said! - I'm just trying to help! Helping? You think this fucking helps, huh? I can fix it. Let me fix it. Let me snap it back into place. No, no, no, no, no! Get the fuck away from me! Get the fuck out of here! Florence! Florence! Florence! Wait! Florence! Wait! Jen. Have you come to save my soul? It's here. Save me, Jen. Set me free. This is no place for the living. Come on. Step into the light. Florence! Florence, please! Please, please, please! Florence, what are you doing? Florence! Florence! No! No! No, Florence! Please, please, please, please, please. Florence! Isabel! Hi, Jen. What are you doing here? What the hell is going on? I was just getting some fresh air. Are you kidding me? That's your... That's your fresh air? Of course. Come on, it's getting late. We should get back. Wait! Are you okay? Of course. Where is it? Where is it? It's here. It's... It's gotta be here. Florence. Florence. It's here. It's got to be here. Give it to me. Give it to me. Sweetie. I just need my necklace back. No. Please give me back my necklace. Please. We can live happily as mother and daughter again. Just like you wanted. Just hand me my necklace. I'm sorry. I know. Mother always knows. Jen! What did you do? Mom. Hello. Are you serious? Who else knows about this? Just me. Good. I want this to stay between us. Are you sure that's a good idea? If people come asking... It's fine. Like you said, nobody knows. Nobody knows. Got a shovel? Jen, it's Louis. Jen, I need to talk to you. Jen! It's imp... Hello. Are you here to see Jen? Yeah. She home? She will be. Any minute now. Come inside. You can wait for her here. No. It's okay. Um... I'll wait in my car. I have... air conditioning. Please. I insist. Okay. Sure. Why not? So what brings you around to see Jen? I... just wanna talk. About what? Oh. Sorry, where are my manners? I shouldn't snoop. It's personal. Please. Take a seat. What was your name again? Louis. Louis. Hmm. I've heard about you. Yeah. Something tells me we've met before. I don't know about that. I'm Florence. Florence? Huh. John's new girlfriend. Jen's dad. He, uh... Yeah. I've met John. Wow. Look at you. In with the whole family. Yeah, sure. I know I shouldn't ask this. Ask what? It's personal. Let's hear it anyway. Are you single? - Are you flirting? - Me? No, no, no, no. I just... You know, you're a handsome man. Ah. So you are flirting. Careful, Louis. Jen's single, too, and... John's told me that there's a little thing going on. Secret crush, maybe? Did he now? Well... Is it true? I don't know what reality John's living in. No. It's not sure Hmm. A shame. She's a pretty girl. Hmm, yeah. She takes after her mother. You look tired. You need to sleep. My mom used to say that to me all the time. Never worked. Well, maybe she's not good at being your mom, then. She was. She is. Did my comment upset you? What did you mean by "was?" You're getting a little personal there. Is she no longer around? I didn't think the dead would allow that. I guess they do. You're not alone, are you? Technically, no. You live with your father? It's... complicated. Ah. You don't get along. What time did you say Jen was getting back? You're reflecting. You do that a lot, you know? Jesus, I didn't know this was a therapy session. You talk like you're in pain. - I'm just trying to help. - I don't need help. No. You need a mom. - Hi. - Hi. Jen, hi. Your friend Louis is here. We're just getting to know one another. Yeah, I can see that. Oh. Hey. How... How's it going? Jen, can I talk to you? Yeah. Privately. What's going on? What are you doing here, Lou? Why didn't you tell me, Jen? Because I just had a chat with your dead mom. She is my dad's new girlfriend, Florence. - Don't bullshit me. - I'm not. You're better than that! I'm telling you the truth. Okay? Look, I know what this looks like. Are you sure about that? Yes. Look, why are you even angry about this? What has any of this - got to do with you? - I'm not angry! Jen. I went to her grave. You what? Her coffin's empty. - And then... - You dug up - my mom's grave? - And... - Why would you do that? - I don't even know how to describe it. It? No, no, no, no, no, the situation, all of this. Look, she spoke to me like she doesn't know me, but... Jen, I need you to tell me how you did it. I didn't do anything, Louis. Please, Jen. I can't take this anymore. I need you to tell me what's going on. I need my mom back. Look, I don't know what's going on. I don't know about any of this. About Florence, or Cameron, or us, I don't know. What's Cameron got to do with this? She's leaving What? When? Sometime in the new year. She's moving to Sydney with Ash. I mean, she told me that she was helping her grandma with the fires, but I saw her today. So maybe this is just a way of telling me to get lost. Don't, don't say that, don't... Look, maybe it's true. Maybe I deserve this. I mean, my mom died, and nobody really cared. Well, Florence is here, and I keep trying to act like I'm okay, and everything is totally normal, but I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to get back to normal. Not really. Jen. This can be no more. You can let us go back to normal. You can let... all of us go back to normal. No, Louis. Things are different now. I just need to know if it's right. What do you do with them? They are the new life. Are you human? Sometimes. You're here because of your mother. Do you... Do you bring the dead back to life? I save them, so you have to let go. Those mothers and fathers who still hold on. But she, she'd been dead for weeks. We had a... We had a funeral. When your father came to me, he knew the risks. He knew he waited too long. And I could not stop it. Florence. Why did she come here the other night? When a child is lost, they returned to what they know. But she, she's not a child. Oh, but she is. Her mind needs time to develop. She has to learn who she once was. He cared for what you turned into. Is there a way to fix that? Make everything okay again? Your mother lives. No. It's not the same. She's alive. Do what you can. They burn you down. I'll see you in the next life you want to keep. Who the hell was that? Louis! Are you stalking me? Wait, did he bring her back? He did, didn't he? Huh? - Leave me alone, okay? - Hey, hey! Who is he? That, that, that... That Sheep-Man. This isn't gonna bring your mom back. Okay? It doesn't work like that. But it worked for you! Your mom's not dead! You don't want this. - But I do! - No. I really do this whole... This whole fucking town wants this! Can't you see it? It's just... It's, it's, it's like some big, huge... Conspiracy? That is the word you're looking for, right? This is, this is all just another one of your stupid conspiracy theories. Did he bring her back? Jen. Did he bring your mother back? I'll see you around. Okay? What? Jen, wait! Jen. It's okay, Mom. Go back to sleep. I'm sorry I never got to say goodbye. What's this? Something to celebrate Celebrate what? You got this. Bye, I love you. Love you, too! What? I'm pregnant, Jen. Your father and I can have a baby. Isn't this exciting? You're not going to be an only child anymore. Yeah, that, that's, that's so great. We're gonna be a family again. Hi, Jen. Hey. Everyone. Music off. You guys are being too loud in here. Lou. Louis. Am I doing good? Cops, Lou. - Fucking cops! - Oh, shit! I'm high as fuck. - Dad's gonna kill me! - What the fuck! You're meant to save me, not you! Cameron! I saw you with Ash. - You didn't go anywhere? - Yes, we did. We came back early! I just... I'm moving on, Jen. But you can't leave. I like you. You're all that I have left! My mom's dead. What am I supposed to do about that? What, you want me to... You're a bad friend. Yeah, you're a bad friend! Don't act like this friendship isn't dying like your mother did. Cameron! I'm sorry. I thought of... Maybe hoped that you'd just slip away. Yeah, well, where else am I supposed to go? I'm so... Jen. Get away from me. Don't touch me. Get away from me! No, no! Come on, open up. You need your medication. Why are you doing this? What happened to me? Nothing a mother can't fix. She had an accident. - Oh, God! Is she okay? - She's asleep. She's okay. She fell, She doesn't remember a thing. Again? - They said... - They were wrong. - You should've called me. - You should've been here. Look, I don't want... I don't want to do this again, okay? I don't want to fight. Of course. There's no need. I'm sorry. Dad. Jen. Hi. Is, is Cameron okay? Cameron? She was in the car. She was in there with me when it happened. Jen. You were the only one in the car. What? - No. - Jen, you were drunk. No. You were driving alone. In a truck. I'm... - No. - Hey, hey, hey. It's, it's okay. I'm not mad. I'm not mad. What am I? What? What am I? Did I die? Oh, no. They couldn't... Not again. She's trying to replace me. You need the rest. You've been through hell, - Everything... - Everything's gonna be okay, Jen. Because we're a family. You've reached Cameron. Leave a message. Enough! Where are you going? Why did you play that song? That was my mother's song. I should take you back to your room. No. Yes. No! Don't talk back to your mother. I need to see Cameron. Why? Because she's my friend. Aren't we friends? She's gonna be here any minute now to pick me up. Pick you up? No. No, no, no. Let me take you. No. No. She's, she'll be here soon. I insist. What good is a mother if she's not there for her daughter? Hi, Pam. I'm here to drop off my daughter. Oh, Jennifer. It's so good to see you. I didn't know you were coming around. Ah, is Cameron in here? Oh, of course, I'll go get her. Jennifer. Hi. What are you doing here? - I just wanted to make sure you're okay. - Oh. Well, I don't see why I wouldn't be, but that's very kind. Has the Ash visited you? No, Ash is busy. She's moving to Sydney, you know. So are you. Me? Oh, no. No. I'm staying right here. I couldn't leave my family. I think we should go now. But we only just got here. I just wanted to say hi, and I've done it, and let's go. Oh, okay. Well, it was lovely seeing you, Jennifer. Yeah. Your favorite. And... beans. Would you like me to make you a full plate? I'm dropping some posters off at your aunt's. I've spoken to the neighbors. If they even suspect you've left this room for even a second, oh, no. Mom. What did he do to you? I saved her. I thought you forgot the fliers. No one's ever meant to die in this town. But she did. And we went there to save her. She's... She's in so much pain. But I'm not. You can't do this, she... She's still out there. She's still missing. We just, we just have to find her. No, she died. Lewis! I found her body, I brought her back. This town's brought her back. The dead woods. - Is she dead? - She's safe here with us. This is all there is, Louis. We can make this work. John, come quick. Jen's hurt. Jen! Jen! Jen! Call an ambulance. Florence. Call an ambulance. Call the fucking ambulance! She's stable. This is a good thing. What kind of fuck is this a good thing? She was getting distant. Refusing our help. But now we can work together to be her parents again. Like a real family. I need a fucking drink. I want her gone. You knew the risks. She's... not the same Your daughter said the same thing. I don't want to be pretending to... If we're trying to start a new family... But she left her to die like it was nothing. She's still learning. Her body accelerates faster than her mind. That's not what you promised me. You promised me my goddamn wife. And I delivered. Do you like something to eat? I'd often get you something. Where's Dad? He's not here. I need to talk to him. You can talk to me. He's my father. And I'm your mother. Why did you do this to me? Sit tight. I'll be right back. Promise me you won't bring me back. I don't give a rat's ass who comes to you after I die. Just promise me. You won't trap me in this life again. You can't just walk in through life. Life is beyond control. I don't give a shit. You bring people back from the dead. I guide souls to where they want to go. I am death. Death does not die. But she can. Don't be so sure. Hi, baby. Strange. I'll get John to pick up another bottle on his way home. Now, how about we get you back downstairs? It's not safe for you up here. Easy does it. You poor thing. It must hurt so much. Now let's see. Hmm. Yes. Oh, don't worry. Mommy's gonna make sure you don't feel a thing. Now, sweetie. Hold still. Hi, honey. Welcome home. Aww. Without your mother? Oh! Dad. Dad, Dad! - Da... Dad. - Jen. We gotta go. Where's your wheelchair? I'm okay. So... Who wants to meet the newest member of our family? Florence. It's Isabel. Isabel. We have a daughter, John. Don't, don't you want to meet our daughter? Isn't she lovely? It's the daughter you always wanted. The daughter you said you never had. Would you like to hold her? What do you think? She is beautiful. Hey. Yes, dear? Dad! Dad! I'm okay. He tried to kill me. You tried to kill your perfect wife. Who'd pay the bills, cook your meals, perfect child. The only thing you ever wanted and now you're scared... I can't imagine the life without you. It remains the same, am I right? I can't. Can't what? I can't live life without you. Without your laughter... There is no life without you. You'll always be here. Good. Play me a song. A song? Yes. Like the one you used to play me when I was a little girl. Song? Mm-hmm.
