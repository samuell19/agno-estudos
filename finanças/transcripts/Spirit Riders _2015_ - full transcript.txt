[Sniff] Cal, stop making so much noise. This door ain't gonna open itself. I don't like this. Look, you ain't gotta do nothin'. Just keep an eye out. I'm gonna go in and get what I need, and then we'll get outta here. Piece of cake. Sure don't like it. Yeah, well you don't seem to mind the money. G... H... L... What I tell ya? [Police radio] FREEZE! [Radio] One-eleven-one-ten Miss Lewis, please stand. This is a serious crime, young lady. On the charge of accessory to the robbery of the pharmacy you have been found guilty. I'm lookin' at your life: graffiti, vandalism, shop-lifting, not exactly heading in the right direction. Are we Miss Lewis? No, sir. I think it's time you start taking this a bit more seriously. You are hereby adjudicated a delinquent and a child in need of supervision. I sentence you to 30 days in Juvenile Detention Center. Oh! [gavel hit] However, I am willing to delay sentencing upon you spending 60 days at the Spirit Rider Equine Therapy Ranch. If you successfully complete the full 60 day period I will bring you back into this courtroom and drop the charges. 60 days... Your honor, we greatly appreciate the generosity of your sentence, and we accept the offer to attend the Spirit Rider Ranch. Smart decision. And Miss Lewis, I hope you make the best of the 60 days because you do not wanna come back through my court again. Am I clear? Yes, sir. Lord did we ever catch a break today. You, my friend, got lucky. 60 days at a horse camp does not feel lucky. It is. Hey. Oh! Look who decided to make it. Hi, daddy. I was here. I was just in the back. That figures. Did you come alone or did you bring her? Hi, sweetheart. So 60 days on a horse ranch? Yeah, great. It's a helluva lot better than juvie. Yeah, you act like you don't like horses. Can we just go? Used to, dad. When I was a little kid. [marching band plays] Come on, boys! Whoo! Let's get some defense! I mean they're just letting them walk right down the field. I always thought you woulda been a great cheerleader. You got the legs for it. Yeah, that is never gonna happen. I can't believe this is how I'm spending my last night of freedom. Oh don't be so melodramatic. You're going to a horse camp not prison. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Seriously? I can't even go to the bathroom? What do you wanna do come with me and watch? Well, if you're not back in five minutes, I'm gonna come looking. Thanks for the real confidence, mom. You've got a lot of nerve, you know that? Would you cut it out? You left me. He was right behind you, I had to get out of there. You drove over it in front of me. What did you want me to do? Sit there and let you bolt right into the car? Babe, I already got two strikes. No, I can't believe it. You're a jerk, you know that? Yeah but you like me this way. Yeah, well, now I've got two months at some horse camp. What? Yeah, light me up. Therapy, huh? Yeah, 'cause I'm a troubled teen with issues. You got off so easy. No, I didn't. It was your fault. They'da locked me up and then lost the key. You're the one who robbed the place, I didn't. You know I heard of these places. It's not like they grade you or nothin', all's you gotta do is show up. It's like being grounded except with horses. Sounds great. You want me to come see ya? There's no visitors allowed. Oh, are those the rules? 'Cause I would never wanna break'em. Look, you don't wanna go. Let's hop in my truck and get outta here. Tonight. Right now. No I can't, and I'm always on my own. So? At least I get two months away from my mom. Text you? There's no phones allowed either. There you go with the rules again. Sneak it. Check it at night. We'll meet up. Alright. And then when I get back, we can get away. Keep running and never go back. [sirens] [crying] I have plans. You need to be there. I can't. Well, she's your daughter, change your plans. Look, I wish I could but I can't. I tried. You know darn well that's a lie. She just doesn't fit into your new life anymore, does she? That's not true. Okay, listen listen. How is she doing with all this? I mean, are you two talking at all? We either start fighting or the conversation turns to him. I can't handle it anymore. She needs her dad. What do you mean? I mean I'm at my wit's end. I don't know what to do about it. I don't know. Maybe, maybe this horse camp thing will be good for her. You know we're gonna get a call in a week. She gonna mess this up, too. Look, just give her a chance please? You know what? When we do, you're gonna be the one go get her. Cuz I'm not doing this by myself. By yourself? What're you talking about Marlene? Do you realize I was there that night? You know, I lost my boy too. No, no. it's not always just about you, okay. Oh crap! Just, you know what? Be a father for once. Dammit! [knocking] Kacie, sweetie. [knocking] Kacie! I'm getting dressed. Is everything okay? God, mom. I said I'm getting dressed. Can you give me some privacy? I made you breakfast. Just come out and eat before it gets cold. Welcome to the freak show! Hush. You don't know anything about these people. I know enough. I'm go out on land but I'm guessing you're the only one here because of a court order. So I'd just climb off that throne miss high and mighty. Your daddy would've been here but he had something come up. He couldn't get out of it. No he didn't. He did! No he didn't. I don't even know why you try to defend him. He did leave you after all. Sorry. Hey! It's okay right? One less grown up to harass me. Well, you just need to make the best of the situation. Our family fortune doesn't afford us too many alternatives. Come on. Come on, let's go. Impressive. Excuse me! Do you work here? Yes ma'am. Mia Parker. I'm just here to check in my daughter. You must be Kacie. We've been expecting you. Aww. And, you must be her mother. Yes ma'am, I'm Marlene Lewis. Is there anything I need to do? Put your signature right here. Okay. Is that the... Horses set their ride? No ma'am. It's his first day here, too. The horses and the campers are working with him to calm him. Okay, that's it. Well let's get you settled in Kacie. Kacie. Honey. Can you just. Please stay out of trouble, can you at least try? Love you too mom. Kacie, I really am gonna miss you. I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself. I'm sure. You can call me if you need anything okay? Please don't embarrass me. And she does it anyway. You just be good okay? Please stop. -This isn't... -Stop. I need to... I am gonna go now. She'll be fine, ma'am. You have my word. Let's go. I assume you read the rules? Yeah. Which includes no smoking. We have a lot of people here. Most of them with special needs. You understand? Got it! Keep your nose clean, do your job and we'll get along just fine. I hope we can become the best of friends. You're bunking in here. Go on in, grab a bed, put your things down. Meet me at the stables in an hour. Yes sir. Hey! Welcome to camp. This is your bed. Oh, there's not really a place for stuff. I have a storage bin I keep under my bed. If you want me to find you one I can. A whole storage locker? For me? You'd be surprised by the luxury that is around here. I'm Claire. Good for you. Okay, I get it. Well it was nice to meet you Kacie. You're the only newbie around here. It's kind of easy to figure out. See you around. [horse whinning] Hello! Good, you're here! What else would I do? Well, for starters, that stall could use a good cleaning. You can fill up the bucket over there. You're joking right? No, ma'am. Is this some kind of labor therapy. It's work. That's why you're here, dear. It's slave labor. What about the horse therapy stuff, huh? That's for paying guests. I think there might be some kind of misunderstanding here. You're here on a work release program. No, no, no, that can't be right. This is bull. Unless you want to go to juvie. Come find me when you're done. [flies buzzing] This fricking sucks. Ugh! (whispering) Oh my God. Ok. Yeah. That's not going to happen. What are you the horse police? You could say that. -Give me that. -Hey! Rules are rules. This is a fire hazard. Look around you. You can't tell me what to do. Well, yes I can. This is my place, I make the rules. Well, I'm not a guest. I work here. Yep, that makes me your boss. -What? -The pack. -Come on -Seriously? Yes. Thank you. Cell phone? I don't have one. No? Okay. My name is Rex and you are Kacie. I know everything about you. Who you are and why you're here. That's creepy. You really got a smart mouth on you don't you? There's a couple of ways you can do things here. You can do it the easy way or the hard way. It's your choice. It doesn't matter to me. Honestly, this is a real fire hazard, this place. Whatever. You might want to try that nicotine gum. It's a good substitute. Yeah, well, not really, but anyway it's better than nothing. Yep, it might ease the pain a bit. Come on. Now that you work for me I'll show you what we do around here. Yeah. The horse is one of the most beautiful and graceful creatures on god's green earth. They're a lot like people. They like to talk and if you're willing to listen they'll tell you exactly how they feel. They'll tell you if they're nervous, or frustrated, or scared. That woman really knows her way around horses. Are those things she said, they true? Every word of it. Are you afraid of horses? No. Why don't you get on up here and pet him? Right there. Good Job. Almost lunch. But you got some raking to do. Here you go. Come on. Thank you. Hey! So, how was first day? Hey, Mike. They're too noisy over there. Well, you're more than welcome to sit here. She's new. She is. She's helping out around here. You shouldn't wear headphones at the table. Whoa, what are you doing? Mike, that's not polite. It's rude to wear headphones at the table. Seriously dude, what is your problem? Okay, Kacie, this is Mike. Mike this is Kacie. You shouldn't wear those in here. Well, I'm doing it anyway. But, it's not polite. Well, I'm not polite so, it's perfect. What? Are you a counselor? No. Mike, Kacie is helping out with things. She's doing chores. Slave labor. She's a slave? No, she's not a slave. That was a joke? [laughs] That was a joke. Alright, well, this has been way too much fun, but, I'm going to get back to my slave labor. No joke. So, that wasn't a joke. No, that's not going to do it. Give it to me. Let me show you something. You comb in smaller circles. Always go in the opposite direction of the hair. That's how you get the dirt out. You see what I'm doing? They're horses. Aren't they always dirty? Not if you brush them. There you go. You brush your hair don't you. Even if it's dirty you still brush it. Well, that's different. Well, they like the way it feels. Don't you? You should talk to them too. You've go to be kidding me. Nah, they like it. I know exactly what you're doing. You do, huh? What am I doing? Yeah, and I'm not talking to you, that lady, or this horse. I've been talking to you people for two years and it's a big crock. I don't care if you recite the Gettysburg Address to this horse, it likes the sound of your voice. It strengthens the bond. So, with all the wit bubbles going on in your head, you're bound to come up with something good. He might even think you're a nice person. Keep going against the growth from the head, to the rump, and up the other side. Hey, Kacie. How's it going? Peachy, I heard you got in with the horses today. Wasn't it cool? If you consider a day of chores and shoveling horse crap cool. Hi, Kacie. Hi, Claire. Hey, Mike. Get in some good horse time today? Yeah, I brushed my horse today. It helps build the bond between the two of you, you know? It seems strange to brush it in the opposite direction but you brush it down later. Kacie where are you going? The cabins are this way. Y'all go on. How are you? * * There's a place where you like to be. * If there's a perfect time. * Time to live and trade in for a cause. * You see your face you see your soul. * You take away the roads. * Whilst you wait in dust, you don't believe * in their truths. * But in yours... Cal. Cal. Oh my God. You jerk. So how's horsey land? Shut up. You got a cigarette? Yeah. Oh my God! It's been a while. Well, yeah well they've got me working here. It's not therapy. It's work release program. You gotta be kidding me. They got you shoveling horse crap? Still beats juvie though. I don't know about that. Hell, I do. Trust me, you're way better off here. You should see the people here. Lean. Half of them are dying or crippled or straight up. Sounds like you fit right in. About the horses, you get to ride or anything? I told you I'm working. Shoveling, mopping taking out the trash. You? Yeah. I hate it. Well, let's get out of here. Wait, what? Off to Mexico baby. You and me. Never look back. What then? I don't know. Get a job at a bar. I'll fish. We'll figure it out. Come on though, you don't need this. I'm afraid of getting caught. Who's afraid? We'd be in Mexico. I think I will try to ride this out. You're crazy. Just told me about how much you hated it here. Yeah, but I don't wanna be like a refugee. You know, that's no better. You gotta get out of here. Come on. Let's go, back here. -Come with me. -Take this. Oh no no. Come with me. I told you I can't. You gotta go alright. Alright. Hey, if you change your mind, call. Kacie. Sir Kennedy. I hope you weren't smoking in there. I swear. You lock everything up? You know we have rules about late night visitors. Visitors? Don't play me for a fool. You will lose that battle every single time. He left. Thank you. There's reason we have the rules. We don't have many of them, but I insist that everyone abides by them. Are we clear on what's happening here? Good. Why don't you head back to the cabin but don't wake anybody up when you go in alright? I will, I mean, I won't wake anybody. Just go. These instructions don't make any sense. You have it right. I know I have it right but just doesn't make sense how it works. You may be onto something. Hey you wanna come try? Me? It's not really my thing. Come on, you can't rake all day. You'd be surprised. You can share with me. Mike, why don't you explain it to her? Are you serious? Take this. It's easy but you just can't think about it too hard, 'cause it doesn't make sense how it works. So you put this part here. No, you can't... Can't do it? Will you just take it then? It's a work of art. But you can't leave it like this. Yeah but I like my version, it looks great. But it's not right. It doesn't... You can't leave it like this. It's okay. It's a bridal. It's a bridal. You didn't try. I can hear you lame brain. Kacie. Come here. I didn't even do anything. He's the one who kept going on and on. The last thing I need is a hothead on my hands. Yeah well you saw how intense he was getting. He has Aspergers. It's a kind of... Autism. Yes I know. I'm not stupid. He can't read people. He's obsessed on details. Intense. Yeah. Well if you know so much about it then why don't you just lighten up on him? If that doesn't work, just be kind. Come on, let me show you something. See those kids? You see them? Yeah. Look at them. They're coming with all kinds of problems. -Big problems. -So? They look like they're feeling sorry for themselves? Sitting back blaming everybody else? Working hard. Helping each other, you know why? They've got nothing better to do? As long as they concentrate on herding that horse, they're not thinking about their problems. Yeah, well as soon as they're done all their problems are still there so what's the point? You don't get it, do you? They are bigger than the hand they were dealt, that's what they understand. Whatever. What about all your pissing and moaning? Does that make your problems go away? So how does that working for you? Every moment you got, is all you get. You wanna squander all away feeling sorry for yourself, be my guest. But let's be clear about something. It's a choice. You don't let your whole life be defined by a single mistake. You're gonna have nothing but a life of mistakes. You know what? You don't know anything about me. All people think you can fix me but you have no idea how I feel. None! You know what you are? You're just some dumb asshole cowboy who thinks has a clue about everything you're talking about but you don't. You don't. Let her go, she'll burn it off. I thought we agreed when I started working here that I was gonna be the therapist. You are. She's gonna be alright. What does a dumb asshole cowboy like me know? She needs her daddy. And a short leash. Tomorrow is another day. Oh god, I need a cigarette. Hey fellow. Hey hey... You don't want to be here either, do you? They probably think something's wrong with you too, huh? We both know that's not true. We're fine just the way we are. Yeah. There you go. Oh, my God. This is amazing. What? You're the first person he's let touch him like that. I believe he likes you. You wouldn't happen to have a cigarette, would you? Sorry. Figures. Worth the shot. Why is he so wild? He's not wild. He was a race horse. Pretty good one, too. He just got old. Don't they usually put them out to pasture or something? Not all of them. Just the really great ones. Blaze didn't make the cut. So what are going to do with him? I'm not sure. But Rex heard about him. He rescues race horses like Blaze, rehabilitates them, and then finds them a new home. Rehabilitate? Domesticates is probably better. I heard Rexs talking about a dude ranch in west Texas that's interested in him. You want to try brushing him? You people and your brushing. It helps... the bonding process, yeah I know. You think I could give a shot? I don't see why not. Okay, good boy. Hey. What a beautiful horse. Yeah. He's strong. I felt bad for him. Because he's retired? They take horses like Blaze and they just. He's staring before they're riding, you know? Before they're fully developed. And when they're done with them, they just. It's awful. Yeah. So Rex retrains them? More like reprograms. So, I heard you and Rex talking earlier. Sometimes he can be a little harsh. Yeah. I hate him. Oh, come on, he's not that bad. I beg to differ. How long have you been working with him? This is my third year. I started as a camper. But I took to it, so I came back to help. You were a camper here? Yeah. That was like so long ago. Yeah, my parents split up too. I heard. Does everybody at this camp know everything about me? I only know because Rex filled me in. Of course. Whatever. Kacie, I know Rex can be kind of tough on you sometimes, but he's right, you know? You going to try and fix me too? You know, maybe I like the way I am. Huh? Maybe. And that's fine. I mean, I felt that way. But then I realized that it's easier to just deal with the pain. Please stop with the mind games. Just know that I'm here if you ever want to talk. I've been there. Really? You've been there? Well, not exactly what you've gone through, but I've had my own set of issues. Did you lose your little brother right in front of you? No. You have no idea. You weren't there, okay? Kacie, but I do know what it's like to blame everybody else for your pain, and to blame yourself. You don't know, okay? You weren't there. I was there. Me. You have no idea. None. I just watched it. He needed help and I didn't do anything. I just froze. Kacie, there's nothing you could've done. Yeah, right. You know my dad's a firefighter? He'd always tell us stories about going into burning buildings. Yes, but he had the right equipment and the right gear. He was trained. It doesn't matter. He would've gone in there and saved him and I didn't. I didn't do anything. I wanted to. I just... I couldn't. I just... I don't know. I let him die so that I could live. [crying] You okay? Fine. We were worried about you. I'm fine, just go to sleep, okay? Clara told me that Blaze's taken a liking to you. You know about my problem. You got to retrain him? I gotta get him to stop thinking like a racehorse and start thinking like a riding horse. How is that working out for you? Touché. Good one. Good one. Now you know what they say about difficult horses. They're not stubborn. They're just waiting for the right person to show up. I could use your help. Blaze could use your help. I'm not a horse trainer. I just brushed him a few times. You don't have to be. It's all about teaching him to trust. It'll be a lot of work, but it'll get you out of a lot of your chores. As long as I'm stuck here anyways. So I'll meet you back here in an hour? So, is this like a promotion? An hour. You hear that? I think we just got promoted. Just... Alright, remember to stay calm. Yeah. Easy for you to say. He's a mirror, Kacie. If you're nervous he's nervous. You understand? Stay calm. Breathe. Breathe in. Okay, go ahead. This is stupid. Why can't you just hold him while I attach the lunge line. Because it's not about the lunge line, it's about knowing that you're in charge and making him trust you. That's what it's about. Thanks. All right, that's it. Bring that lunge line with you and come on out of there. I just started. Just bring me the lunge line and hop out of there. Come on. I can't waste my time. I thought you said you wanted to help. Huh? I do wanna help. Hey, why don't you tell him that? It's stupid. If you don't care, he doesn't care. I do care. All right. Let's try it again. Go ahead. Go for it. Do it. Take that lunge line and show it to him. I've got nothin' to hide. That's what you wanna tell him. There you go. There you go. Relax. Now you're talkin'. It's just me. She did good, huh? You were right. That's good. We're in this together. [laughs] Yeah. Walk. Walk. He spent his whole life running around the track where he was king. Now we gotta get him to slow down. Any other bright ideas? He knows you wanna stop him. You're earning his respect. That's a good thing. He just keeps going past me. You shorten that lead, that'll help. Slow him down. Walk. There you go. There you go. You're doin' great. All right! Give him some praise. Good boy! Good boy! All right, that was great. So, let's do it again. Come on, let's go. -Oh. -Again. Mike, come on. Here. No use goin' thirsty because I'm a jerk. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Come on. Look's like you put in a full day. So, you ever work with horses before? No. Rex must have a lot of faith in you. Why's that? Letting a newbie work with a racehorse. My parents would freak. Oh, you must know my parents don't care what happens to me. That's a bit dramatic. Welcome to my life. You know people care more than you think they do. I know that's not cool to think, but it's true. You know you really need to stop talking about things you know nothin' about. Let's go. Yeah. Blaze, come on. Seriously. All right, let's go. You know they're use to doing running or the trot. Not maneuvering in the real world, not like this. Well we need to get him to act differently. We gotta get him to have his head down. They're looking straight ahead for that finish line. They're not aware of what's right in front on 'em on the ground. We gotta get his head down. Aw! Gosh! Come on, get up. We'll try it again. Gotta get his head down. Just get him used to walking like that. You know what I mean? Hmm. You said I need to get his head down, right? Hey. You want it? Let's go. Come on. Right here. Wanna another one? Here. Come on. Here we go. I thought I'd seen everything. That's a good idea. Come on. Right there. Yeah. Kacie. Welcome to the world. Don't push it. Hey, Mike. I've never had chicken like this at a ranch before. I wonder if it tastes different. Why would it taste different? I don't know. I just wonder. Mmm, no. It tastes the same. I'm sorry. Why? So, what kinda music do you listen to? I'm guessing you're a rock chick. And you strike me as a boy band kinda girl. I like pop, top 40 stuff. Of course you do. And you? I'm right, right? Yeah. I'm a rocker chick. And if you'll excuse me... The sloppy joes taste better here, and, and, and so do the hot dogs, but that's, that's pretty much it. Have you ever heard of Phonolux? I love Phonolux, yeah. No way! Did you have their new one? Nashville Skies? Yeah. It's my favorite. Who's Phonolux? I just downloaded this one, it's really good. I'll find it for you. She's, she's choking! She's choking! She's choking! She's choking! She's choking! She's choking! She's choking! She's choking! She's choking! She's choking! Are you okay? Yes. You, you okay, Kacie? Yes, just give me a minute Mike. That was okay. She, she was choking. Yeah, I know. But she's okay now. I know. Mike, I know. So, why, why are you so upset? I should've done something this time. I mean, even you, you got up and you got help. I just should've done something. Should've gotten help. But you can't now because it's over. Do it different next time. [laughing] Can I have your attention for a minute? As you know we just have a few days left of camp. [crowd] Aww. Me too. I need to tell you a story you might not be aware of; you know Blaze the new horse this year? Of course. And he's a thing of beauty to be sure. Well what you might not know is that Blaze was once a race horse. Not long ago. And the very thing that made him a great race horse, are the things that make him a sorry riding companion that's for sure. You've seen Kacie and I working with him over the last couple of months. And what we were trying to do was get him to follow rather than lead. To retrain him from all the things he'd done his whole youth, which is exploding out of a start gate. Even though his bones weren't fully formed. It's one of God's miracles he even survived. Most of all is to get him to trust, and to earn that from a horse is a lot of hard work, and a lot of heart. And that is exactly what Kacie has done. Now hopefully he is going to be heading over to a riding ranch in West Texas. But we're going to have to prove to those folks over on that ranch that Blaze is ready for it. It's kind of like an audition. So normally I do that sort of thing, but I think Kacie has earned the honor. And so Kacie, nothing would make me happier if you present Blaze at his you know presentation. [applause] Way to go Kacie! Speech! You did good today. Mike can have tomorrow off and go on the trail ride with everybody. Enjoy the corral for a bit, but you have to promise to behave. Okay? No galloping off. Kacie. Dad? I had a couple of runs out this way. I thought I'd stop by and say hello. I didn't think we were suppose to have visitors. Well I already cleared that with Mr. Kennedy, he said we could make an exception this one time. So looks like you got it pretty good out here. It's alright. Come here, I want you to see Blaze. Blaze, this is my Dad. Dad, this is Blaze. It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. I'm sorry. Yes, I have been told about all the wonderful things she's been doing around here and quite frankly I couldn't be more proud. It's been pretty cool. I bet you and mom thought I'd be kicked out of this place by now. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't expecting that phone call. I'm trying Dad, I really am and I've been thinking a lot about things. I want things to be better, and I know I've been messing everything up, but I really think they can be better. We can just, start all over. You know? All we've got is what we've got right now and I can make it better. I know I can. Everything. You and Mom, you guys can get back together, and we can all be a family again. Doesn't that sound great Dad? Kacie, Kacie. I'm going to marry Cathy. But Mom. Your Mom and I, we couldn't make it work. I mean this is better. I know I put a strain on things, but you guys can work it out. Right? That's not true. You can fix it. Yea it is true, Dad. I know I messed everything up , but I will fix it. If you give me a chance. Okay Dad? There's nothing for you to fix. This is so unfair. I don't know how you can even do this Dad. Kacie. Go away! Go! [crying] Hey. What are you doing? Okay guys, snacks are over here. Good girl. There's yours. Thank you. So Kacie, how's Blaze been? I bet she's got her ear buds in. I don't have my ear buds in. How's it going? Are you okay? I'm fine. Kacie you haven't been a jerk in a long time. You're not going to start being a jerk again, are you? Sorry if I'm a jerk. Something happen? I heard your dad was here, everything okay? Everything's great, he's getting married. Oh wow! Oh. Wow. You're not a jerk. I just don't want you to be a jerk. I don't think you're a jerk. So do you like the fiancé? She's fine, I guess. I don't really know her. I'm just stupid I thought that... Kacie, you don't think that I think you're a jerk do you? No Mike I don't. Ok, good, because I don't. I thought your mom and dad were getting re-married. Yeah. How stupid is that, right? I wished the same thing about my parents for forever. Even after my mom remarried. It's not stupid. Well as long as we're having this little group therapy talk, you know what really bugs me? That none of this even matters. As soon as I get home the mess I made will still be there. And I can't do anything to fix it. That's not completely true. I can't believe I tricked myself into thinking that things could actually be different for once. You know what this, this is just all a big distraction, that's what it is. We should catch up. No just let her go. But she needs us to cheer her up. No Mike. Not right now. I don't like it when she's sad. Mike, do you have a crush? I think I'm jealous. Why? You're not my girlfriend. [phone chime] What's up baby? Quiet. Check this out. You're gonna wake everybody up. Okay stop. You're drunk. I'm not drunk, I'm feeling good. Are you ready baby? Just give me a second. Seriously you're going to choose a horse over me? Hey. Hey you'll be okay. Rex will present you. Just listen to him and stay in the moment and don't run off, okay? I can't do this. What's that babe? I said I can't do this Cal. Wait, what? No. I gassed up and everything. We're headed to Mexico baby. -Come on -I'm serious Cal. What is wrong with you. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked you to come, alright? You're not going to go with me when this is all over. No, you're not flaking on me now because of a stupid horse. We're leaving. Now. Cal. No, I'm not. Let go of me. You shouldn't be mean like that. Who's this? Mike, go back to bed. Is he being mean to you? What's it to you? Kacie. Are you leaving? We are. Now get out of here. No Cal I'm not leaving with you. Is he your boyfriend? Yeah. Well, you don't treat her nice. I can treat her however I want. Let her go. Mike. She doesn't want to go with you, let her go. You got to be kidding me. Okay, party's over! Get out of the way creep. Oh, what are you doing? When I tell you to go, we're leaving. Come on! -[gasp] -Oh my God. Stop it! Get off of him. What are you doing! He's a freak. And you're a selfish jerk. You called me, remember? Just get out of here. Aw, crap. I gotta go. I got to save those horses. Get the horses out of there. Make sure all them are accounted for. Mike. Where's Mike? Where is Mike? Kacie, where's Mike? No! Hey! Mike! Mike are you in here? Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Kacie, Kacie... How's she doing? She took in some smoke but she's fine. I spoke with Mike, he's ok He was lucky. He had a guardian angel. Can we have a moment of privacy? Sure, take all the time you need. Mr. Kennedy. Uh uh. I thought I told you to call me Rex. Two steps forward one step back. You're all over the place. Save your lungs. There's nothing you need to say. What you did tonight, that's one of the bravest things I've ever seen, ever. You saved all our horses. You saved Blaze. And then you go on and risk yourself to save Mike. You risked your life. I am so darn proud of you. I guarantee your daddy is going to be proud of you. And your brother, looking down on you, he's going to be proud of you too. However, there is still the thing of how there was a fire in the first place. Mr. Kennedy, Rex, what happened We found your bag in the ashes. Now, Mike and Claire, they filled us in on the details. Claire didn't offer much. But, Mike, I don't think he knows what a lie is. You know, I warned you about sneaking out at night, I warned you about smoking, and I warned you about late night guests, but you do it anyway. I'm sorry. So, here's the deal. I'm not gonna let you show Blaze. But, you even said so yourself, he responds better to me. I can't count on you. But you can. I made a mistake, but I can fix it! This is not a punishment. I just cannot count on you. So really what I need you to do is just ride out the last few days and try to stay out of trouble... And when the courts concerned... Look at me, don't look away from me. So far as the court is concerned, you've completed your program, and I'm not gonna mention a word of this in my report. Kacie, breaking the rules and always running away, that's something you do out of fear. That's who you think you are, that is not who you are. What you did on this night, that's who you are, and no matter where this life leads you, don't you ever forget it. You hear me? It's just not fair! I wish you wouldn't leave. I already called my mom. I hate seeing you be this way though. Hey! I like to go out with a bang. Don't you even want to see how Blaze does? Doesn't really matter anymore. You don't believe that. What I believe, is that I always seem to screw things up. Blaze is better off without me. You saved Mike's life last night! You saved the life of every horse at this ranch! From a fire I started! You didn't start it. Yeah, well, he was here because of me. Do you blame yourself for everything because you really believe it's your fault, or is it just another excuse to feel sorry for yourself? I'm sorry. I'm gonna go see if my mom's here, and I'm sorry you had me to deal with. Kacie, I'm sorry, and I didn't have to deal with you. I just hate seeing you beat yourself up over this. Okay, you did a great thing! Why can't you just focus on that? You gotta stop holding yourself back. You sound like one of them now. See you in a little bit. Hey! All burned down. It's gone. Yeah. They say you saved me last night. It's the least I could do to repay you for protecting me from Cal. They also said that you're leaving? Yeah. Please don't go. I have to Mike. You don't have to. Yeah, I have to. We need to talk. You take away her opportunity for good, solid therapy so you can get a good presentation, and then when she makes a mistake, you start practicing tough love at the expense of the horse. I don't get it, Rex. Her daddy came here and kicked the legs out from under her for some reason. I didn't do it. Now we got ranchers coming here, they're on their way, and if they don't find a riding horse, it all becomes about money, and they will ship Blaze off to Canada and to a slaughterhouse. Slaughter. Now that's what I'm lookin' at. So I gotta step up. All I know is, if she leaves here thinkin' she screwed up everything again, I don't know if she's gonna get another chance. What is it you always tell the kids? You fall off, you get back on again. It's not a fall that defines you, it's what you do when you get back up. I thought she did a pretty good job. Don't you? Y'know, I'm gonna miss you, Mike. Well, if you stick around one more day, then you'll have less time to miss me. Hey, listen to me. This whole time I've been here, no one has been smarter or taught me more than you have. There's no way I could have lasted this long without you. Last night, you were my hero, Mike. You are a hero. You punched me. Yeah. Well, you got right back up. You know, you didn't take no for a... Those are the guys for Blaze. Yeah. You should be riding Blaze. I should. See you later, okay, Mike? Appreciate you, sir. Let's go ahead and get him in the barn. Hello. I'm riding Blaze. Shut up. Blaze trusts me more than anyone. He stands a better chance with me leading him than anyone, and you know that. I am riding him. Well, if you're gonna do it, you better go get ready. Oh, okay, here. Alright, let's go boy. Ready, let's do this! Chop, chop! Go. There you go. [applause] [applause] So that was kind of awesome. Yeah Blaze owes you his life. Well, I don't know about that. You did great. Blaze did great. Yeah Do me a favor? What? Take credit for it and enjoy it. Hi Kacie, so I know you're leaving today and I just wanted to say goodbye. But, this time, for real. I'm gonna miss you. Yeah, well, that's because I'm awesome. Yeah, you are awesome. Please don't be a jerk again? Alright, I promise. OK, well I don't like this so I'm going to go, bye. Bye So, they're taking him now, huh? West Texas or something, right? I'm never going to see him again. There you are! Oh my God. Look at you! You were unbelievable out there! How did you learn how to do that, you were amazing! I mean, I was absolutely blown away, I seriously am! Kacie, Neil told me about the fire, and how you could've been killed. Baby, I'm just so, so proud of you. I've gotta go, okay. I'll be right back. So, what happened? What you two did, under difficult circumstances... So, are they just going to take him? No, that wasn't meant to be. Well, I saw you, you shook hands. He offered me a better deal. Blaze was amazing, you said so yourself. Money is little pieces of green paper looking for a new home, that's all it is. What's going to happen then? You know, you've got so many questions Kacie, you might want to talk to the man who bought him, he's standing right behind you. Dad? What? Are you serious? Oh yeah. Well, there's still a lot's to work out. I'm going to have to keep this horse at your ranch Rex. I'm going to get out of here before all of the hugging starts. Thanks Rex. Oh my God! You keep your grades up, You can come here on weekends and during the summer, I don't see any problem with that. I can do that, what about mom? It was your mom's idea. Thank you dad! Just do me a favor, don't go burning anymore barns down, do you hear me? I want to make you and mom proud. You already have baby. I love you. I love you too! Hey! * You're wondering what's gotten into me * I'm not the girl I used to be. * No it ain't no mystery, * You're what's gotten in me. * You're wondering what's gotten in my soul * I'm not the girl you used to know. * Jesus it's no mystery, * you're what's gotten into me. * You're what's gotten into me.
