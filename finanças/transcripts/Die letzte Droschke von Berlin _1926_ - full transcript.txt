Their son, Karl WERNER PITSCHAU Wilhelm Lemke Bread and Fine Baked Goods Confectionary and Cafe Anna Lemke, the daughter of the house EVI EVA Out of order "It's enough to pay for the coal and the oats." "I can't buy anything to eat!" "And you..., Karl?" "As ever, nothing!" "Then what will there be for later!" "This must last for the whole week!" "Mother sure is sick, when she can't even screech!" "It can't go on like this! Sell your old nag and snatch up a twelve cylinder!" "And no foolery before the wedding!" "You know how obstinate father is!" "My purse...!" "You must go to the constables! And to the lost-and-found office!" "An Antiquity...!" "It belongs to my sister! But we need the money!" "Why don't you also become a chauffeur?" "Did you have any other customers that day?" "Of course..! At least a dozen!" "It seems that Erich nabbed a purse! And then a watch..." "Where did she get this? It's a gift from Erich...!" "HE STOLE IT!" "I'm bringing this to the police!" "Soon you'll have your turn, my little love birds!" "She was in such a rush that she forgot it!" The next day "Do you have witnesses?" "There were no witnesses there! I was alone with the other one!" "So you'll stand by the assertion that you bought this watch on the street, from an unknown!" "Alright then...! We'll retain you here, until we've searched more thoroughly!" "Margot...! I swear to you that I've done nothing dishonorable!" "Are you satisfied now...?" "I didn't want to make any troubles for you...decidedly not!" "We'll see soon, whether he's guilty or not...!" "And then, Papa, you won't hinder our marriage any longer!" "Will you permit an innocent to be condemned?" "I swear to you, I did not steal the watch...!" "...I found it!" "You are free! You can go!" "But this time he bought it in a store, before witnesses!" "Do you hear, Papa...! His innocence is proven!" "Come, Margot...! Let's go!" "He'll take off soon! And you...you too should scram!" "Already up, Karl!" "I would not have thought that you would be capable of such a thing!" "In all seriousness...A marriage means no more fun!" "Already finished...?" "Congratulations, Mrs. Flottman!" "I love my children...This devil of a chauffeur has bewitched them all!" "You'll turn everyone against you!" "I'll try to talk with him!" "...You've been hoodwinked, my child!" "You've twisted my son's head, and on their account my wife's left me!" "You're not a man! I won't live with you anymore!" "Go and see what he's up to!" "I will have to give up my trade!" "Well – and you...! You also have nothing more to lose, my poor Lieseken!" ...five minutes ago! But he was so peculiar, as if he'd been drinking!" "Is Lieseken hurt?"
