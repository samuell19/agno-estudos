Merry Christmas. Oh, Jim, dear. It's the one I was admiring, isn't it? - Trimmed with ribbons? - [whimpering] JIM: Well, it has a ribbon. [gasping] Oh, how sweet. - JIM: You like her, darling? - Oh, I love her. What a perfectly beautiful little lady. Come on, Lady. Over here. That's a girl. There, now. A nice little bed for you. DARLING: But Jim, dear, are you sure she'll be warm enough? JIM: Why, of course, darling. She'll be snug as a bug in a... Uh-oh! Almost forgot something. There. JIM: Good night, Lady. Now, now, don't worry, darling. She'll go right to sleep. No, no, Lady. This is where you belong, right here. - [whimpering] - DARLING: Oh, look. She's lonesome. Don't you think maybe? Just for tonight? JIM: Darling, if we're going to show her who's master, we must be firm from the very beginning. [whimpering] [Jim pounding on ceiling] Lady! Stop that now! Stop it! [whimpering] [footsteps] [whimpering] [Jim pounding on door] Lady! JIM: Quiet, now. You hear me? Back to bed! Quick, now. Not one more sound. [chiming] [scraping] [snoring] - [whimpering] - DARLING: Jim, dear. [groaning] [whimpering] Aw, Jim. JIM: Hmm? What? [whimpering, howling] [Jim yawning] JIM: Oh, all right. But remember, just for tonight. [rooster crowing] [chiming] [Darling groaning] [yawns] All right, Lady. All right. I'm up. I'm up, Lady. Oh, no! DARLING: What's wrong, Jim? What is it? Can't you explain to Lady about Sundays? [barking] [growling, barking] [bicycle bell rings] JIM: Have you noticed, darling, since we've had Lady we see less and less of those disturbing headlines? DARLING: Yes, I just don't know how we ever got along without her. JIM: Say, she must be about six months old. We'd better be getting her a license. Hope it fits. My, but it does look nice. So grown up. Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised? [humming] ♪ Four steps straight and then to the left ♪ ♪ And right to the place where I marked it ♪ ♪ With a bonnie, bonnie bone that I buried for me own ♪ ♪ In my bonnie, bonnie bank in the backyard ♪ A-ha, that's a grand sight. LADY: Jock! Oh, Jock! Hello, Jock. Oh! Oh, it's you, lassie. [chuckles] Notice anything different? Eh, uh... You've had a bath? No, not that. You've had your nails clipped? LADY: Mm-mmm. Guess again. Well, I wouldn't a-be knowin'. Why-o, lassie. A bonnie new collar. - Do you like it? - Aye. [sniffs] Mmm. It must be very expensive. - Have you shown it to Trusty yet? - No. Ah, we'd best go at once. You know how sensitive he is about these things. [snoring] [whimpering] [snorting, howling] He's dreaming. JOCK: Aye. Dreamin' of those bonnie bygone days when he and his grandfather were trackin' criminals through the swamps. - LADY: They were? - That was before... Before what? 'Tis time you knew the truth, lassie. JOCK: It shouldn't have happened to a dog. But, well... Trusty has lost his sense of smell. - [Lady gasps] No! - JOCK: Aye. But we must never let on that we know, lassie. It would break his poor heart. Uh... Which way did he go? Which way did he go? - Go? - TRUSTY: Yeah, big fella. About, uh, six-foot-two. [sniffs] No, uh, three. Wore a striped suit. No collar. Why, Miss Lady. You have a collar. Mm-hmm. And a license. My, my. - How time does fly. - Aye. It seems only yesterday she was cuttin' her teeth on Jim Dear's slippers, and now there she is, a full-grown lady. Wearin' the greatest honour man can bestow. The badge of faith and respectability. That's right, Miss Lady. As my grandpappy, Old Reliable, used to say... I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before. Aye, you have, laddie. Oh, yeah. - [whistling] - Ooh, it's Jim Dear. Please excuse me. Hello, there, Lady. Come on, beat you home. Oh, you win again. Steady, now. Steady. Well, what have we here? Oh, big girl now, huh? All right. Oh, ladies first. You know, darling, with Lady here I'd say life is quite complete. DARLING: Yes, dear. I don't imagine anything could ever take her place in our hearts. [steam hissing] [train whistle blows] [train chugging] [stretching] [shuddering] Ah! What a day! Well, now to dig up some breakfast. Hmm? [chuckles] Aw, cute little rascals. Cootchie-cootchie-coo. Now. That breakfast, let's see. Bernie's? Mmm... no. Francois... No, no. Nope. Too much starch. Ah! Tony's. Oh, that's it. I haven't been there in a week. TONY: ♪ A beautiful day to make pizza ♪ ♪ Hey, still we call it bella notte ♪ [scratching] Well, buon giorno, Butch. You want-a your breakfast, eh? OK. The boss, he's a-saving some a-nice bones for you. Breakfast comin' up from a-left field. [chuckles] Good catch! [man whistling] MAN: Whoa, boy, whoa. [whistling continues] [man humming] Hey. Psst. Psst. Blimey. - Look, Peg, it's the Tramp. - TRAMP: Shh. Hiya, handsome. Come to join the party? All right. No time for wisecracks. I've got to get you out. I'm telling you, the pressure's on. Signs all over town. - Gee, thanks. - You're a bit of all right, chum. - OK, OK, get going. - MAN: Hey! What's going on there? Scram. And be careful. - [snarling] - Why, you mangy mutt. Hey. Let go. Let go of me. Well. Snob hill. Ha! Hi, gals. How's pickings? Pretty slim, eh? Yeah. I'll bet they've got a lid on every trash can. Uh-oh. And a fence around every tree. [chuckles] I wonder what the leash and collar set does for excitement. Lassie. Lassie! Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am. Miss Lady! JOCK: Ah! Good morning, lassie. 'Tis a bonnie, braw, bright day. Uh... ...day. Why, Miss Lady. Is something wrong? Aye. Tell us, lassie. - If somebody's been mistreatin' ya... - Oh, no, Jock. It's something I've done, I guess. You? It must be. - Jim Dear and Darling are acting so... - [Darling humming] [humming continues] - Jim Dear and Darling? - Hush, lad. Now, lassie, get on with the details. Well, I first noticed it the other day when Jim Dear came home. [clock chiming] [barking] Down, Lady, down! Darling, darling! Are you all right? DARLING: Of course I am. Why shouldn't I be? JIM: I just can't help worrying. After all, in your condition, alone here all day, and walking that dog... - That dog! - That dog? He's never called me that before. Well, now, lassie, I wouldn't worry my wee head about that. Remember, they're only humans, after all. That's right, Miss Lady. As my grandpappy, Old Reliable, used to say... I don't recollect if I've ever mentioned Old Reliable before. Aye, you have, laddie. - Frequently. - Oh, yeah. But now Darling is... Well... We've always enjoyed our afternoon romp together. But yesterday... [chiming] [barking] [humming] [whining] No, Lady. No walk today. [humming continues] [barking] No, Lady. Not now. Lady! Drop that, Lady. Drop it, I say. It didn't hurt, really. But Darling has never struck me... before. [chuckling] Now, lassie. Do not take it too seriously. After all, at a time like this... Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady, there comes a time in the life of all humans when, uh... Well, as they put it, uh... Birds and the bees? Or... Well, uh... The stork. You know. Uh, no? - Well, uh... - What he's trying to say, lassie, is Darling is expecting a wee bairn. Bairn? He means a baby, Miss Lady. Oh. What's a baby? JOCK: Well, they resemble humans. TRUSTY: But I'd say a mite smaller. JOCK: Aye. And they walk on all fours. TRUSTY: And if I remember correctly, they bellow a lot. Aye. And they're very expensive. You will not be permitted to play with it. But they're mighty sweet. And very, very soft. Just a cute little bundle. [chuckles] TRAMP: Of trouble. Yeah. They scratch, pinch, pull ears... Aw, but shucks. Any dog can take that. It's what they do to your happy home. Move it over, will you, friend? Homewreckers, that's what they are. Look here, laddie. Who are you to barge in? The voice of experience, buster. [chuckles] Just wait till junior gets here. You get the urge for a nice comfortable scratch, and, "Put that dog out!" He'll get fleas all over the baby." You start barking at some strange mutt. [barks] "Stop that racket. You'll wake the baby." And then! Then they hit you in the room and board department. Remember those nice, juicy cuts of beef? TRAMP: Forget them. Leftover baby food. And that nice, warm bed by the fire? [chuckles] [thunderclap] A leaky doghouse. - Oh, dear. - Do not listen, lassie. No human is that cruel. Of course not, Miss Lady. Why, everybody knows a dog's best friend is his human. [Tramp laughing] Oh, come on now, fellas. You haven't fallen for that old line, now have you? Aye. And we've no need for mongrels and their radical ideas. Off with you, now. Off with you! - OK, Sandy. - The name's Jock. - OK, Jock. - Heather Lad of Glencairn to you! OK, OK, OK. But remember this, Pigeon. A human heart has only so much room for love and affection. When a baby moves in, the dog moves out. JIM: Uh-huh. Oh, let's see. That'll be about... Oh, well. [pounding] JIM: Darling? There isn't any way we can tell for sure what it's going to be, is there? DARLING: I'm afraid not. Nobody ever knows for certain. All we can do is hope. [chiming] [footsteps] [yawning] [wind howling] [door closes] Darling, are you sure you want watermelon? DARLING: Mm-hmm. Oh, and some chop suey too. Chop su... [sighs] Oh, all right, darling. [door shuts] [women giggling and chattering] WOMAN 1:... the cutest thing. - WOMAN 2: Those booties! - WOMAN 3: That bonnet. - WOMAN 4: Adorable. - WOMAN 5: Don't you love showers? WOMAN 6: I've never seen you more beautiful. WOMAN 7: Isn't she radiant? WOMAN 8: That's just what I told Bill. "Bill", I said, "Darling looks positively radiant." In all my days, "I've never seen anyone as radiant." [men laughing] MAN 1: Aw, Jim, you look terrible. MAN 2: Absolutely horrible. MAN 3: I never saw you look worse. MAN 4: Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones has never lost a father yet. [laughter] [thunderclap] JIM: Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's a boy. Uh-huh, a boy. And... What's that? Eyes? Oh, what colour are they? Well... Oh, gosh. I-I forgot to look. A boy. It's a boy, it's a... Doctor! Doctor, it's a boy! Yes, yes, I know. Uh-huh, a boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy! It's a boy, it's a boy, it's a boy! [Aunt Sarah on phone] Hello?

DARLING: Jim, I just can't leave him. He's still so small and helpless. JIM: He'll be all right. Now come on. If he wakes up we'll never get away. Jim, I feel so guilty deserting him like this. JIM: Nonsense. JIM: Hey. What's the matter with Lady? DARLING: She thinks we're running out on him. JIM: Oh, don't worry, old girl. We'll be back in a few days. DARLING: And Aunt Sarah will be here. - JIM: With you here to help her... - [doorbell rings] JIM: There's the old girl now. Coming, Aunt Sarah. Coming! [Sarah panting] Sorry I'm late, dears. Hope I haven't kept you waiting. - JIM: Let me take your things. - No, no. No fussing. I know my way around. On your way, now. Mustn't miss your train. Have a good time, and don't worry about a thing. Goodbye, dears. Goodbye, goodbye. JIM and DARLING: Goodbye.

Aw, you poor kid. Oh, we've got to get this off. Hmm. I think I know the very place. Come on. Well, here we are. - The zoo? - Sure. No, no. This way. Follow me. [guard humming] - LADY: Oh. - What's the matter, Pige? - We can't go in. - Why not? - LADY: The sign says... - TRAMP: Yeah, well, that's... - That's the angle. - Angle? Look. We'll just wait for the right... Uh-oh. Here we are now. Just lay low. [whistling] [barking] - GUARD: Hey, you! - I beg your pardon. - Were you addressing? - What's the matter? Can't you read? Why, yes, in several languages. Oh, a wise guy, eh? All right, now, what's this creature doing here? - He's not my dog. - Oh, he's not, eh? Go away. Get down. Go on. Why, certainly not, officer. I suppose you'll be tellin' me next it was the dog that was whistling, eh? - MAN: I'm certain I don't know. - Oh! So I'm a liar now, am I? Well, you listen to me. A-ha! Resisting an officer of the law. You're gonna pay. Ow! Pull a knife on me, will you? Trying to assassinate me, you are. Carrying concealed weapons. [arguing continues] Come on, Pige. The place is ours. [arguing continues] We better go through this place from A to Z. Apes. No, no. No use even asking them. They wouldn't understand. They wouldn't? Uh-uh. Too closely related to humans. Uh-oh. TRAMP: Alligators. Now there's an idea. Say, Al, do you suppose you could nip this contraption off for us? [echoing] Glad to oblige. Whoa. Whoa! [hysterical laughter] Ha! If anybody ever needed a muzzle, it's him. - ANIMAL: Timber! - Pigeon, look out! Now what harebrained idiot would... Hey, look. A beaver. There's the answer to our problem. Let me see here. Six-foot-six and seven-sixteenth inches. Pardon me, friend. - I wonder if you'd do us a little... - Busy, sonny. Busy. Can't stop to gossip now. Got to slide this sycamore to the... [straining] ...swamp. Well, this will only take a second. Only a second? Listen, sonny. Do you realise every second, 70 centimetres of water is wasted over that spillway? - TRAMP: Yeah, but... - Gotta get this log movin', sonny. Gotta get it moving. Think the cuttin' takes the time? It's the doggone haulin'. [straining] TRAMP: The haulin'. Exactly. - Now, what you need... - I'd better bisect this section here. What you need is a log puller. [shouting] I said a log puller! I ain't deaf, sonny. There's no need to... Did you say log puller? And by a lucky coincidence you see before you, modelled by the lovely little lady, the new, improved, patented, handy dandy, never-fail little giant log puller. The busy beaver's friend. You don't say? Guaranteed not to wear, tear, rip or ravel. Turn around and show the customer the merchandise. And it cuts log-hauling time 66 per cent. Sixty-six per cent, eh? [giggles] Think of that. - Well, how's it work? - Why, it's no work at all. You merely slip this ring over the limb like this, and haul it off. Uh, say... You mind if I slip it on for size? Help yourself, friend. OK. Don't mind if I do. How do you get the consarned thing off, sonny? Glad you brought that up, friend. To remove it, simply place the strap between your teeth... Like this? Correct, friend. Now bite hard. You see? It's off. Say, that is simple. Well, friend, we'll be on our way now, so... Uh-uh. Not so fast now, sonny... I'll have to make certain it's satisfactory before we settle on a price. Oh, no, it's all yours, friend. You can keep it. I can, eh? I can? Uh-huh. It's a free sample. Well, thanks a lot. [chuckles] Thanks ever so... Say! It works swell. LADY: But when she put that horrible muzzle on me... Say no more. I get the whole picture. Aunts. Cats. Muzzles. Well, that's what comes of tying yourself down to one family. Haven't you a family? One for every day of the week. The point is, none of them have me. I'm afraid I don't understand. It's simple. You see... [sniffing] Hey. [sniffing] Something tells me it's suppertime. Come on. I'll show you what I mean. Now take the Schultzes here. Little Fritzie, that's me, Pige, makes this his Monday home. - Monday home? - Ach, ja. [with German accent] Monday is Mama Schultz cooking der Wiener Schnitzel. Mmm. Delicious. [Irish accent] O'Brien's is where little Mike, that's me again, Pige, - comes every Tuesday. - Every Tuesday? Begorra. And that's when they're havin' their darlin' corned beef. You see, Pige, when you're footloose and collar-free, well, you take nothing but the best. - [singing in Italian] - Hey! Tony's! Of course. The very place for a very special occasion. This way, Pige. I have my own private entrance. Wait here. Just one minute. I'm a-comin'. I'm... What's a-matter? Somebody's a-makin' da April Fool with... [barking] Oh, hello, Butch. Where you been so long? Hey, Joe, look who's here. Well, what do you know? It's Butch. Hey, hey, hey! Joe, bring some bones for Butchy before he eat me up. - [chuckling] - OK, Tony. OK. Bones a-coming up. [barking] Huh?

Don't feel that way about it. Of course not, Miss Lady. Why, some of the finest people I ever tracked down - were jailbirds. - JOCK: Quiet! You great loony! Uh, please, lassie. We've come with a proposition. JOCK: For helpin' ya. Help me? What do you mean? Well, now... You see, lassie... Neither of us is as young as we used to be. But we're still in the prime of life. Aye. And we've both got very comfortable homes. TRUSTY: That's right. Where we know you'll be welcome and appreciated, Miss Lady. So... So, to come directly to the point... [clears throat] If you could, uh, find it possible to, uh... To, uh... You're both very kind, and I do appreciate it. - But... - TRAMP: Oh, Pigeon. Oh, Pi... TRAMP: Oh! Oh, hi, boys. Anything new in the kennel club set? [chuckling] A little something I picked up for you, Pige. Hmpf. Looks like I'm the one that's in the doghouse. If this person is annoying you, Miss Lady... We'll gladly throw the rascal out. That won't be necessary. Thank you. Very well, ma'am. You... You... ...mongrel! Aw, come on, Pige. - It wasn't my fault. - Hmpf. I thought you were right behind me. Honest. When I heard they'd taken you to the pound... Don't even mention that horrible place. [sobbing] I was so embarrassed and... - And frightened. - Oh, now, now. Who could ever harm a cute little trick like you? LADY: Trick? Trick! - That reminds me, who is Trixie? - Trixie? And Lulu and Fifi and Rosita Chiquita wh... - Whatever her name is. - Chiquita... Oh! Yes! Well, I-I... As far as I'm concerned, you needn't worry about your old heel. [stamm
