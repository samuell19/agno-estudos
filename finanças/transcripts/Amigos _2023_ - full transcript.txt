A TEARFUL TRIBUTE TO K. VISWANATH, A DADASAHEB PHALKE AWARDEE My parents taught me how to live and helped me get into the film industry that introduced me to the world. I thank them wholeheartedly. They were overjoyed when my dream of becoming a film director came true. But they both departed from this world before my film could be released. It was the most unfortunate event in my life. I hope my parents, who had always wished to see me reach new heights, will continue to bless me from their heavenly abode. I present my first film to you in memory of my late parents. Siddu! What's the progress on the land deal at Lanco Hills? Mr. Siddharth will meet the land owner today, sir. Okay, right. Mom! I need to leave for college. Come fast. Yeah, I'm coming. Here, take this. Here you go. Where is Siddu? Stop fiddling with your phone while eating. I'm searching for my study material, Mom. - Liar. She's checking Instagram. - Hey, you... "I can survive ten days without coffee and three days without food, but cannot survive ten minutes without my phone." - That's her Instagram post. - Hey, you... Leave her alone. What about you? How many more alliances will you turn down? The marriage bureau has run out of possible matches for you. How long will this go on? Mom, I have a dream about my future wife. She should look interesting, and should talk and think interestingly. - For that, I can wait... - You can wait as long as it takes. Keep waiting. In the meantime, I will get married and have kids. And you can play with them. Okay? UNCLE Hello, what's the matter? Sister, where is Siddu? He is having breakfast. I told you to have food at my place as your wife is out of town. I didn't want to get scolded by you guys at home as well as at work. Nonsense! Siddu, he wants to talk to you. - Tell me, Uncle. - Siddu, I am getting ready. We have a client meeting today. The guy is a bit cranky. Get there soon. Okay, I'll be there soon. Mom, I need to go. Bye. If you are okay with the land development proposal and agreement, our company will start the construction work. I know about your company's history. But you too should know about the history of my land. Yeah, sure. You can tell us about it after we sign the agreement. Shall I start? - Yeah, sure. - Go ahead. My grandfather worked as a stand-up comedian under the Nizam of Hyderabad. Oh! He got this piece of land as a gift from the Nawab in appreciation of his work. - Wow! - Wow, awesome! What is awesome about it? That's when tragedy struck. My grandfather had many fans. One of them took my grandpa's autograph on the land document and went away. - So sad. - So sad. It's okay. But my grandfather is very strong. He fought for that piece of land. And those documents were not easy to tamper with. So, no one could do anything. I have some expectations about my future husband. You may have dreams about your future husband... He kept searching for that guy... Uncle! I think your mind is elsewhere. You need to hear this story from the beginning. Come to my office tomorrow and hear the full story. Please leave the documents here. Sir, please... We can't listen to this story from the beginning. What are you looking at? He walked away. We lost our business deal. It's okay, Uncle. I have found an interesting girl. Please don't say no. Let's get married. Okay. Let me present a hypothetical situation. And if you answer my question based on the hypothetical situation, then I will marry you even if you are not from my caste or you don't have a job. Hey, my friends call me Walking Google, you know? Ask me anything, I'll answer in a jiffy. Okay, Google. A guy approaches me at a four-way intersection and asks me the time. Before I answer, he grabs my phone and runs away. When I start screaming for my phone, another guy comes there. And this guy snatches my bag and runs away in another direction. And I'm in shock. Now a third guy comes near me. And before I can tell him what happened, he snatches my chain and runs in another direction. Now that all the three have gone in different directions, whom do you go after and what will you bring back to me? I can only chase one guy by myself. Mobile phone. Purse. Girls don't mind losing anything, except for gold jewelery. Yes, I... I will go after the guy who snatches your chain, and I'll thrash him and bring your gold chain back, honey. Rejected. Rejected! Isn't it confusing? It is interesting. Hi, you are listening to Magic 106,4 FM. Let's listen with enchantment. I am RJ Ishika, and it's always fun with Ishika. Do you know something? When we desire something passionately, people around us think that we are mad. But they will be shocked if the same comes true for us. Have a strong desire in your heart, and it will happen for sure. - Okay, bye. - Bye, see you. I love you, Ishika. Another guy! Let me ask you a question. She is at it again. These three guys run away in three different directions. Now what will you do and what will you bring back? I think the bag has the makeup kit and lipstick, so... I will bring back the bag. Rejected. I love you, ma'am. Your heroine has quite a big following What will you do and what will you bring back? The only thing left is her phone. I will get your cell phone back. Rejected. Yes, she rejected him! Come on. Come on. Nephew, her question has only three possible answers. And she rejected all three. She will reject you too if you propose to her. I will not propose to her. Then? What is this? - Greetings. - Greetings. - Welcome. - Please come in. Hi, you are listening to Magic 106,4 FM. - Mr. Jayendra, that's my daughter's voice. - Oh, yeah? - Isn't it lovely? - Yes, it is. Don't do anything stupid. Or I'll kill you. First, give it to your suitor's mother, and then to his father and then to him. Wear a smile. Why are you staring at her like a starving animal? Will you devour her? I'm visualizing my life with her. Honeymooning in Switzerland, my kids in a good school, and my retired life in Ooty. You are so fast. This can happen only if she likes you back. Crazy girl. Can't you make out from her shyness how much she likes me? You are so desperate! Oh, no! Uncle... My face is totally burnt. Oh, my God! Looks like this will be rejected as well. My face... Are you okay? Forgive us, Mr. Jayendra. My daughter still plays mischievous pranks on others. It's natural to be mischievous at her age. We like the girl very much. Dear, they say they like her. I am so happy. Talk to your daughter and let us know. I am so happy that your marriage is getting fixed. To celebrate, I've finished my third round. My dear nephew. Hi, baby! How are you? You always prefer this brand of liquor. Anything special about it? Hey, I like that question. Let me tell you. A lady by the name Janet Sheed Roberts lived in the same house for 110 years. This liquor is named after that house. After her death, her children started this company in memory of their mother. That is its specialty. So much history behind this, huh? Sir! I won't give out any information for free. Get lost. Hey, Sathi? - How are you? Long time, no see. - Who the hell are you? Have you forgotten me? We together owned a fishery business. I don't know who you are. Go away. - What are you saying? - Why are you calling me Sathi? - How could you forget it? - He is sloshed. Bro, please calm down. - We both... - You are disturbing us. - Is he with you? - Yes. He is drunk and calling me Sathi. - What is this, Uncle? - Hold on. What did you say? Am I drunk? I come to this pub every weekend. Where is that guy? Hey, Thimmaraju, come here. What a nuisance! - He sent me drinks during the lockdown. - Yes, sir. Today is Saturday, July 21, 2022. He is Sathi and he was my partner in the fishery business for two years. Bro, I don't know who he is. This is the first time I'm seeing him. He has already ruined our celebrations. Please stop this nonsense and move on. Siddu, he is right. It seems he's the son of a police officer. - This will turn ugly if you don't leave. - Bro, please. We are really sorry. His father used to run a grocery shop. When did he become a police officer? Forget it. Let us leave. Uncle, this guy is your business partner, Sathi. This is the same pub where we drink every day. And that is the guy who supplied us with drinks during the lockdown. You see look-alikes only in movies. They don't exist in real life. They do. They do exist in real life. The guy you saw here is a doppelganger of your business partner. What? Dope gang? No, it's doppelganger. It means a look-alike. I'm sure you have heard about it. Yes, we have. Wait, now I will show you. Uncle, it's awesome, isn't it? Oh, my! You are right. Aren't you surprised to see some unrelated people look the same? That means their parents had indulged in some mischief? Hey, it has nothing to do with their parents. They have even conducted DNA tests and found no relation between the look-alikes. They have concluded that their families were not related even 200 centuries ago. Do you know the most exciting part? Even we can meet our doppelganger. Seven lakh people have met their doppelgangers so far through this website. Isn't it a wonder to meet a look-alike who is in no way related to us and yet shares similar physical features with us? - Yes, it's a wonder. - That's right. Have you met your doppelganger, man? I'm searching. I haven't found him yet. - You won't find him. - Why? There can only be one handsome guy. Thanks for your information. - These guys will pick up my tab. - Okay, sir. Thank you. He doesn't give out any information for free. Please pay the bill. Pay the bill. So, Uncle, you didn't meet your friend, Sathi. You met his doppelganger instead. What the bloody hell is that! Hail Lord Ram! How long has it been since I shaved and bathed? - Come on, guys. Catch him. - Hey! Your mother is worried about you. Let us go home. My mom? She died long ago. What a great man! - You idiot! - Don't yell at me. They mistook Ram for Bheem as they both look the same. The guy you saw here is a doppelganger of your business partner. Even we can meet our doppelganger. Doppelganger. You should write exams with concentration, not with confusion. Okay? - Give this to your brother and father. - Hold on. I will forward all the materials to you. - Mom? - What is it, son? Did the girl's family call us? They need time to think it over. They will let us know. Eat your food. But they said they liked this alliance, right? They should have called us by now. Why the delay? Maybe their phone is out of order. So funny! I will deal with you later. Hey, your mom took two months to respond to my proposal. Don't worry. This will definitely work out... What is happening? Snake gourd! Hey, Siddu! Look what you've done. Looks like he ate snake gourd. - What happened? - Get some ice, quick! She must've given him this dish, while distracted on the phone. Get some ice. It is going to be okay, son. How many times have I told you to give up eating snake gourd? You know he is allergic to it. Mom, I've had this problem since childhood. Why should Dad give up his favorite food for my sake? - Listen, son... - Please don't panic. We need to get to work. Let's go, Dad. - Hey, Siddu... - Let's get to work, Dad. - You got scared. - You really scared me! - Wait, you are done for. - You got scared, right? Some day you will also get scared. Hey, stop there. - As if you can make it happen. - How dare you scare me! I'm going to tell Mom and Dad about this. You are done for. Hello. Hey, hi! This is Siddharth from Hyderabad. Yes, tell me. I am your doppelganger. What? My doppelganger? I can't believe it! I feel the same talking to you. I am really excited. What do you do? Excuse me! What did you say? What do you do? I manage my family business. What about you? I work as a programmer in Wipro. How come your Telugu is so good? Are you a Telugu? No, my family hails from Mangaluru. But we are now settled in Bengaluru. A lot of people in our office, including my boss, are Telugus. So I picked up a little Telugu. Oh, okay. You know, I come to Hyderabad very often for my office work. Oh, that is really nice. We should meet when you come to Hyderabad next time. Okay? Yeah, sure. Right now I am in Goa. I guess, I'll be in Hyderabad next month. - Nice. - Okay, Siddharth. I have a meeting right now. Can I call you later? Bye. Yes! Hello. Hi, this is Michael from Kolkata. Michael? From Kolkata? What do you want? - You. - What? I am your doppelganger! Is this a joke? Do you think a doppelganger is a joke? Wow! Interesting! I was shocked to learn there is another person like me. Now I have one more look-alike. Unbelievable! I can't believe it. Is there any another person who looks like us? There's Manjunath Hegde. He is from Bengaluru. Oh, a Kannadiga! Yes, he is currently in Goa. Next month he is coming to Hyderabad. We are meeting. But why wait until next month? Anything can happen in the meantime. New virus variants may emerge. Wars may happen. Why don't we meet in Goa? I can't wait to see my look-alikes. Wow, that's a really great idea. I am eagerly waiting to meet you all. I am dying to meet you. Bye. Oh. Manjunath Hegde? What the... Oh, my God! You look exactly like me. It's unbelievable! It feels like I'm looking in the mirror. Fantastic, bro. Nice meeting you. Sixth finger? Lucky finger, bro. Thank you. We planned to meet in Hyderabad, right? Why the sudden change in plan? Anything special? It is not my plan to meet you in Goa. I didn't choose this place either. - Whose idea is it, then? - Michael. Michael? Who is he? - Another guy who looks like us. - Really? Oh, my goodness! Looks the same. - I'm Michael. - I'm Siddharth. - Nice meeting you, Siddharth. - Same here. Hi, Manju. I can't believe it. But it is true. Hey, Manju, did you notice this? We are all of the same height. It's so strange. I am lucky to meet my look-alikes. I am so happy to meet you both. - Yeah. - Me too. What did you say? I am happy too. Your Telugu is so good. How's that possible? It's because I travel around the country on business. And I have picked up a few south Indian languages. - Oh. - Nephew. What's happening? I didn't believe you when you told me about them. Is this for real? How come three unrelated people who are each other's look-alikes meet through a website? By the way, he is my uncle. Hi, Uncle. Hi! Have I become an uncle to you too? Let's take a selfie and post it on Instagram. It'll create a buzz on social media. No, no. No! We shouldn't do that. If we do that, everyone will know about us and we'll lose our privacy. This is the best moment of our lives, guys. Let's celebrate. Just the three of us. No, we are four. We have sought friendship We have landed here to find each other We spread our wings to fly here Traveled in different directions To descend here We answered destiny's call To light the lamp of our friendship We are a mirror image of each other Though we come from different backgrounds, Let's join hands and journey together We have sought friendship We have landed here to find each other Just like the sea, The waves and the shore Let's go rocking together Let's keep this bonding unbroken forever We are awesome amigos! We are the flamingos In the friendship world! We have sought friendship We have landed here to find each other It's okay to frown a bit It's all part of friendship It's fine to overlook our defects They are a part of human nature Let's find the reason why we met here Let's show the world The magic of friendship We have sought friendship We have landed here to find each other Every pair of eyes from now on Must reflect only happiness For the reminder of our lives This friendship must remain intact Siddu! Before I was born, my parents had two baby boys but both died as infants. They say that I was born after they prayed to Lord Manjunatha. Those two brothers of mine would look like you two if they were alive. You are like my own brothers. I feel the same. We have sought friendship We have landed here to find each other We are amigos We are amigos Hush! - Freeze! Don't move! - Freeze! Where is Bipin Roy? Bipin Roy? Who is Bipin Roy? Bastard, I will blow your head. Tell me where Bipin Roy is. We don't know who you are talking about. Sir, it is... - This is Mr. Unnikrishnan, right? - Tell us where he is. Sir, h-he left the place a week ago. He has gone away, sir. Hey, what is he saying? - Sir, he says Bipin has left a week ago. - What? O-One minute, sir. Hey, stop! It's just a letter, sir. He asked me to give it to anyone who comes looking for him. We won't let him get away this time. Spread the hunt across the country. Yes, sir. Okay, thank you. Where is Siddu? Hi! Can I have two Goan fenis, please? Catch me! Michael will love it. Ishika! Ishika! Wait, Ishika. Wait. Sir, please pay up. Here. Come on, Ishika! Sorry! You've followed me all the way to Goa? I've already told you that this won't work. Hard luck! Who is that girl, Siddu? It's a closed chapter. Leave it. Siddu, are you in love with her? Mom, did Ishika's parents call? - Yes, they did. - They did? Are we fixing the wedding date soon? Forget it. It's not going to happen. The girl doesn't like this alliance. My uncle and I went to find out why she didn't like me. I checked my weight. You carry on. I will join you. Focus at the top angle. Zoom in and zoom out. And then... Why are you following me? I'm Siddharth. The other day, I came to your house for a marriage alliance. Did you forget? I've already said that I don't like you. What's wrong with him? He comes from a good family. They have a house in Jubilee Hills and own a business. He has a huge bank balance. What else do you need to marry him? Uncle! Calm down. These are not the qualities I look for in a suitor. Then what do you want? Run around this park thrice without stopping or getting tired. What? You want him to run around this park thrice? What are you saying? It's around seven kilometers long. If he runs that distance without stopping, he will die. What has running around the park got to do with marriage? The one who marries me should have three qualities. Number one, he must have high energy levels. He must carry the same energy throughout the day. From morning to evening. He must do whatever I ask him to do. He must never say that he is tired. Even energy drinks can't help you. Number two, multitasking. No matter how busy he is, he must get me whatever I ask for. He'll quit his work and be at your service all day long. No... He must not quit his job. He must do his work, and simultaneously he must work for me and also look after my kids. What nonsense! Number three, speed. If I am in danger, he must rush to me and rescue me. Overall, he should be like a superhero. Who can possibly do that? Only robots can do that. Haven't you tried again? He tried many times and finally gave up as he felt that even the Gods have forsaken him. Only a miracle can turn his love story around. We meeting here is in itself a miracle. Can't this miracle help you succeed in winning her heart? Trust me. It will work. How? Where are they? Oh, my! Hey... Who is Siddu among you? Michael! Manju! What is going on? - High energy levels. - Multitasking. Speed. Three people. Three tasks. One face. All for one girl! For my girl! - You will fall. - No, I won't. I told you that you will fall. I mean, you will fall if you run without tying your shoe laces. Thanks. Manju, she is coming your way. Okay, Siddu. I am going. Nice shoe laces. Oh, God! It's difficult to keep up with you. What are you looking at? He passed me by five minutes ago, and he did it again just now. You are getting crazier by the day. No. I really saw him pass me by. How is that even possible? This park is seven kilometers long with a pond in between. There are no shortcuts. It takes 30 minutes to run around the park. Is he a Hussain Bolt to sprint so fast? Come, let's go. Oh, my God! Oh, my! Michael, you are next. Come here, Nikitha. You didn't believe me when I told you. Look there. He comes running towards us again without any sign of fatigue on his face. Siddu, you have her attention now. Hey! Haven't I told you that such a guy exists and that he will cross my path? You treated me like a mad person. What do you have to say now? I say the same. Why? You told him about the various qualities you are looking for in a guy. And I suspect that he is playing a trick on you. Yes! - Is that so? - Certainly. I need to find out if he actually did it. I will put my theory into practice. He is the guy who will retrieve the stolen items from us. You think he is some superhero to catch all three of us? Poor girl! She believes we will return the items we are going to steal from her. Just think about this. First, we get paid for stealing some items. Then we can make more money by selling the stolen items. Good days are ahead for us thieves. Guys, Ishika is here. What's the plan now? Ishika has come up with a test for us. We just have to pass the test. How do we pass the test without knowing what it is? I know what this test is all about. Come... Excuse me, ma'am. What time is it? Half past four... Hey, my bag! My phone! What's up? - Bye. - Hey... My chain! Run fast. - Please stop them. They stole my phone... - Go that way. Hey, stop. Let's participate in the test, guys. - Ishika? - Mr. Siddharth, my bag, chain and phone... - Bag, phone, chain... - Hold on. Let's not get confused. I will get them back. Wait. Now I will know what you are. Why are you chasing me? It seems like a safe place to hide. Hey, why is it spinning like this just when I thought it was safe? Thank God it stopped. Oh, God! Give me that bag. You want to come off as a hero by returning this bag to her? But you won't get the chain and the phone. Hello. - Hello. - Bro, he is following me. Who is he? The superhero the girl told us about. He's in front of me now. How can he follow you? Have you both lost your minds? That guy is coming after me. Are you both trying to gang up to deny me my share of the loot? If he is really following you, then bring him to our place. Hello, ma'am. Your girlfriend. Hey! What is it? Bro... They are calling me a cheat because of you, and I can't stand it. Tell them that you have been following me. Tell both of them that you've been following me. Hey, will you just shut up! Bro, tell these buggers that you followed me here. They don't seem to get it. I chased you. Did you hear that? I chased you. I chased you. He didn't even move his lips. Where is the sound coming from? I am the one who chased all three of you. Return the stolen items and get out of here. Are you playing games with us? You think you are Lord Krishna to chase after the three of us? You won't get anything. Get lost. We will thrash you if you try to play the hero. He's not listening to us, bro. Hit him! O Lord Krishna It's Lord Krishna. Forgive us, Lord. We won't commit such mistakes again. You never appear before us when we visit temples. But we see you today because we've stolen something. Please take your items back and forgive us. Please take them back. Please forgive us. We won't do this again. Did they escape? You caught only one guy? The three of them fled in three different directions. How did you... I mean, how did you do it? Bye. Hush! It's Ishika. She's calling you now? - Hello. - Hello, Mr. Siddharth. Who is this? It's me, Ishika. Ishika who? You brought back my phone, bag and chain which were stolen. Oh! It's you. Yes, tell me. I need to talk to you about something important. Shall we catch up over some coffee tomorrow? Tomorrow... I will be a bit busy. It's okay. Let's meet when you are free. Bye. Hello, Ishika... Since you say it's something important... We can meet up for sure. Come to Punjagutta Coffee Day at ten o'clock. Okay. Bye, good night. Good night! Yes! Mike, ever since you came here, I've been saying this. You came to Hyderabad to help me. So, I don't like you staying in a hotel. Mike, why don't you stay with us at his uncle's house? We can celebrate this happy moment. Meet Ishika and come back with some good news. Then we will party together. - Listen... - Good night. That's how he is. Searching for Bipin... is as good as seeking your death. The officer is dead. The trap has worked. It's time to initiate the plan. Ishika, I'll be there in five minutes. No... Wait! Not Punjagutta Coffee Day, let's meet at Makobrew in Jubilee Hills. You reached sooner than I expected. Sometimes things just work in our favor. - Please sit. - Sure. You wanted to discuss something important. Tell me. Actually, the person I've been waiting for all these years is right in front of... Hey, what's that? That guy looks just like you. Oh, God! What is he doing here? He also looks just like you. Oh, no! I am done for. You might soon end up saying that everyone in the coffee shop looks like me. There is a term for this in psychology. It is called... It is... I think it's called love. This phenomenon of seeing your beloved in every person is something I have seen only in movies. But for the first time, I am feeling it. I love you, Siddu. Constables, check him. Give it to me. Sir, we found a dead body and he was an NIA officer from Delhi. Hello, sir. This way, please. - Play it. - Yes, sir. Stop. Play it back. Play it again. Freeze. Zoom in. My God! It's Bipin Roy. - Mr. Mathew. - Yes, sir? Go to Hyderabad immediately with your team. - Take help from NIA Hyderabad. - Okay, sir. - Hold on. - Sir. You must capture Bipin this time at any cost. Sure, sir. Siddu, are Manju and Michael going back to their hometowns? Oh, Michael! So serious. Hey, Mike, how do you like this T-shirt? Why is everyone wearing a similar attire? Are you planning something again? - This is a gift from Mike. - I see. Manju, why do you look so downcast? I feel very sad that I've to leave you both and go back, Siddu. You both are like my blood brothers. I too feel sad that you both are leaving. Come one, guys. It's a miracle that we met and now it's important that we part ways. We all have lives of our own. Let's move on. Hey, Manju. We'll meet again soon at my wedding. Then we will give a big surprise to our families, okay? Just remember one thing. We are all one. You will always be a part of Siddharth. I am not part a of Siddharth. I am Siddharth. Wow! You can even crack jokes! Come on, let's move. He already looks wretched. If he creates a scene at the airport, we will attract everyone's attention. That's why I've booked a cab for him. Why? The cab has arrived. Let's move on, guys. Manju, here is your phone. Mike, you have an early morning flight. Shall I come to drop you? I'll call you. I like your sense of humor. - Hi, Ravi. - Hi, Mathew. Based on your information, we've found out that this is his hideout. Move. Move. Shit. Don't move! Goddammit! Come on. Get over to the other side. Move. Move fast. This way! Let's go. Let's go. Don't move! Don't shoot, you idiot! We need him alive. Siddu! Siddu! Hey, Siddu. - Hey. Hey! - What? What do you want? Michael was arrested. What! The NIA has arrested Michael. His real name isn't Michael, it's Bipin Roy. What are you talking about? Who are Michael and Bipin? Who was arrested? Are you still drunk? It's a breaking news on TV. Watch it! Around 12'o clock in the night, near the financial district of Hyderabad, during a raid conducted by the NIA, a person named Bipin Roy injured some NIA officers and ran away. He was shot in the exchange. The incident has sent shock waves across the city. Bipin Roy kept moving to different places with different names and disguises. This means that he had come here to hide. He is out of danger according to KIMS Hospital and the hospital wing is under the NIA's control. We'd have a chance to interrogate him only when he recovers. - Hey, Uncle. Look there. - What is it? That is not Michael. That is Manju. Manju... Manju? Look at his sixth finger? HUGE CACHE OF DRUGS SEIZED IN HYDERABAD Did they arrest Manju mistaking him for Michael? Shit! I don't understand what is happening. I'm unable to unlock my phone. Give me your phone, Uncle. The number you have dialed is invalid. Please check the number you have dialed. Hello, Hotel Radisson. Did anyone check in at your hotel by the name Michael? No one has checked in with the name Michael, sir. Then Bipin? Sorry, sir, no one has checked in with the name Bipin either. - He has not checked in at the hotel. - What is happening? We should not do that. Everyone will get to know about us otherwise. You can also stay with us in his uncle's house, right? How's the T-shirt? Why are you all wearing the same attire? Are you planning something again? They didn't catch Manju mistaking him for Michael, Uncle. It's Michael who got Manju caught. He is currently out of danger. But we didn't get any useful information from the hard disks and mobiles that we got from him. Doctor... Officer Mathew from Delhi headquarters. - Hi! - What's his status now? His vitals are stable. But we're giving him a high antibiotic coverage. Make arrangements to take Bipin to Delhi immediately. - Sir. - We shouldn't move the patient. His life will be in danger if he gets infected. It will take him a week to recover. - Can I talk to him now? - Sure. - But don't stress him out. - Thank you. - Chief... - Okay. Jai Hind, sir. He is out of danger, sir. You already know that this is a high priority case. The Home Secretary is keenly observing this operation. Yes, sir. I am aware, sir. He just regained consciousness, sir. I know that you are not Bipin. I know that doppelganger story of yours. But if you say that during the investigation, your family will be killed. Do you know how I will kill them? Look here. If I press the trigger, the bullets will pop out of their heads. Their heads will be blown up like watermelons. Your silence alone can save them. What happened, Nurse? His pulse rate has gone up. What? How could this happen? Damn it! What if something happens to him? Mathew, our regional office doesn't have any information about him. The NIA Chief is anxious, now that the media is talking about Bipin. Who is this Bipin? Bipin. Bipin Roy. A nightmare to national security. A merchant of death. A bloody gun dealer. He is an Indian Pablo Escobar. It's been so long since I had... a home-cooked meal. Please... Nice! "The Devil in the Dark." Nice title... The demon behind the rising gun culture in the country... Bipin Roy. I like your efforts to popularize me in the world. But the thing is... Publicity... I bloody hate publicity... Are you threatening us? - Daddy! - Hush! I don't threaten anyone... I just kill. Daddy! Arjun! Brother! You used your pen power to try to stop my business... But to stop you, I will use... She is only a kid... Don't harm her... I beg you. I will give you all the evidence... Leave her alone. She is also an evidence. Please I will... You bloody... I will kill you! When you go digging graves, you'll unfold history. But if you try to find my history, you will be digging your own grave. Error or exception... No, no, no Good or bad... No, no, no Sin or virtue... No, no, no The only thing I know is destruction You won't find him if you search He will appear as death incarnate... Do any kind of work to make a living. But if you stand in my way... I will kill you. He's a monster He's a monster He's a monster He's a monster He's a monster... Didn't I warn you that I will kill you if you stand in my way? Morals, justice... No, no, no Mercy, kindness... No, no, no Value of a life... No, no, no He walks like the Lord of Death... Everyone in India should be able to get a gun as easily as a matchbox. He's a monster He's a monster He's a monster He's a monster He's a monster... He killed every single one who stood in his way. And just then... James Buster Douglas, an international lobbyist. He supplied weapons to rebel groups in Syria, Sudan and Iraq and brought disasters in those countries. I usually deal with the nation's army heads, and in worst cases, with terrorist organizations only. But for the first time, I'm dealing with an individual. Well, you don't have any other option. I need 50,000 assault rifles, 50,000 assault subs, 10,000 hand grenades, 5,000 rocket launchers and 100 pounds of nitro-RDX explosives. These need to be delivered to my people in India. Are you sad that you are supplying weapons to destroy your own country? I am a businessman. I sell death. I'd even sell weapons to aliens if they wage a war on Earth. All I care about is money, I don't give a damn about anyone's life. Alright! Done. When crime met terror, Bipin caught the NIA's attention for the first time. We were shocked to find that they've been smuggling illegal weapons for the past 20 years. The meeting between Douglas and Bipin created a tsunami in the NIA. We found out that they were backed by the People's Army of China. They've planned mass genocides in India on 15th August, at 26 places. If they succeed, it would be the most dangerous disaster in history. We need to make a counterplan immediately. No matter what, we should not leave out a single weapon or contact of Bipin's. Kill the conspiracy from the roots. - Okay, sir. - Sure, sir. Bipin! The NIA has come to know about you. We have to move from here without leaving any evidence. That is why I am killing every evidence. I am your friend, right? I don't want to kill my friend but the evidence has to die. So die. Come on... come on... fast. In order to catch Bipin and his arms dump simultaneously, we raided all the warehouses, villas and hideouts associated with him, but he made a fool out of us every time. We alerted all the national borders so that he doesn't escape and also issued red corner notices to all the countries. After shadowing him for six months, we've finally managed to nab him. Sir, he is conscious now. Bipin, we know everything about your attacks planned for 15th August. Everything is under our control now. But anyway, let me come to the point. Where is the arms dump? Where is it? Bipin, look at me. Answer me. Where did you keep the arms dump? Bipin, you cannot get away from this. Come on, answer me. Where is the dump, Bipin? You have to tell us. You are finished. I am so happy to see you both. You are like my own brothers. I feel sad to leave you, Siddu. Manju is safe and has regained consciousness, it seems. But he is being tortured in the name of interrogation. We didn't expect Bipin to be so dangerous. I am scared of him. Manju is innocent, Uncle. Poor fellow, he doesn't know anything. It's me who asked him to meet. I am the reason why he is suffering now. Why don't we tell everything to the NIA? Why didn't Manju tell them anything during the interrogation? How can you be so sure that he didn't tell them? If he had said anything, the NIA would have been here. Or Manju would have been with us. Since neither is the case, something else must have happened there. What shall we do now? I need to talk to Manju... at any cost. Subha, check if she is clear... Stop. Watch... Phone... Turn... All clear, sir. Sir. Siddharth... Phone. - Siddu. - Hello, Manju. How are you? I am very scared... I'm scared that they'll kill me, Siddu. I don't know what is happening around me. I want to see my p-parents, Siddu. Manju, Manju. Just stay calm. Control yourself and calm down... I will get you out somehow. Why didn't you tell everything to the NIA? I-If I tell them, they said they are going to kill me and my parents, Siddu. Who? A-An NIA officer... He is the officer who shot me. Siddu, he knows everything about us. That means there is someone in the NIA who is helping Bipin. B-Bipin? Who is Bipin? Michael is Bipin. That bloody... He stayed with us and learned about us so that he can trap you and escape. What's taking so long? Toilet... Okay, I will see to him. You come out. - Siddu. - Tell me, Manju. In that case, I am not Michael's target. It is you, Siddu. Me? That day, uncle gave me your phone thinking it's mine. On the way to the airport, you got a call from Michael. Michael! He wanted some help and asked me to come to an address. He asked me to bring a bag to the footover bridge wearing the jerkin kept there. I thought he wanted some help like how we helped you with your love story. After that, I don't know what happened. Hello! Hello! Siddu! Siddu! Hello, hello... Manju? Open the door. What took you so long? Why did he try to trap me? It was a miracle that we met but now it's important that we go our separate ways. I am not a part of Siddharth. I am Siddharth. Shit. Siddu... Ma'am, the puja is over. Bless your son with these offertory for his longevity and success. We'll take your leave, ma'am. It's inauspicious if our look-alikes bump into us. I'm scared to even think that a look-alike of yours has been staying in Hyderabad. Okay, we've performed a puja to remedy the situation. Don't panic unnecessarily and make him panic too. The cops have arrested the guy. You need to calm down. I was really worried when your mom told me about it. I will just be back. Hello. Bipin, please let me go. The only chance to escape from the NIA who have been hounding me for six months... is Siddharth, whom I met on a doppelganger website. But you let him escape instead of killing him. You are unable to breath, right? Same here. If he spills the beans to the NIA... All my plans will go haywire. Siddharth won't open up or reveal anything. Trust me, he didn't tell them anything. There's tight security at the hospital. I will kill him after a week when we shift him to Delhi. Siddharth must die as Bipin. His death is my breath. This is Siddharth's phone. Did he stay in your house with your identity? That is why he wanted to kill Manju thinking it was me. One minute. If he wanted to kill you, he would have done it when he was with us. Why didn't he do it then? He doesn't want Siddharth to die. He wants Bipin to die in the eyes of NIA. Siddu. Don't leave him at any cost. He is not an ordinary person to fight with, Uncle. He is a bloody monster. So, should we let him go? He is staying in your house. What if he hurts your parents and sister? As long as he is posing as Siddharth, he won't hurt them. The NIA will shift Manju to Delhi in a week. If that happens, we'll never be able to reach him again. It won't be Manju whom they'll be transferring. It will be Bipin. Oh, God... I used to look up to this house as a heavenly place. Now it feels like a haunted house. Nephew! I'm scared. If our plan has to work, I should know every move of his. You must go. Talk to the consulate general and get my visa approved. Deposit Rs. 5 crore in Siddharth's account. Hey, you seem to have changed completely. - You've never looked at me like this. - Shanvi... Hi, Siddu! Why are you playing around with him, you idiot! - You think you are still a kid? - What did I do? What did I say? Just look at him... Don't you see any difference? You are a grown-up but you have no brains. Don't you know how or what to talk to your elders? Hey, what happened? - Why are you shouting at her? - Look at him, Dad. I was just telling Siddu that he has changed and see how uncle is scolding me. Why are you shouting at her over such a small issue? What? A small issue? What the... Have you lost your mind too? Do you know what she said? - What is this? - She said Siddharth has changed! She said that Siddharth has changed! What will his future wife, his future in-laws, and her grandmother think about him, if they hear that he has changed? - Hey. - Dear. Have you gone mad? Why are you talking nonsense? Am I mad? If you know the truth, then you will go mad. - What happened to him? - I don't know. Mother-in-law! Come, dear. You were the only one left. It looks like you are all discussing something important. Nothing, dear. He is blabbering something. What's with this sudden surprise? I am going to Bengaluru tomorrow to attend a friend's wedding. I will come too. Hello, sir, how can I help you? A room in the name of Siddharth. Siddu, a single room? Yes, madam. Single or double occupancy? We're getting married next week, right? That's exactly my point, Siddharth. We're getting married next week. You have to wait until then. One more room, please. - Okay, ma'am. - Thank you. Also please arrange a car to go to Moongate Resorts. Sure, ma'am. Many nights can pass but nothing Like tonight's moonlight splendor! Many kisses follow but nothing To match the hot mist! So says the little fellow Who has a pie on everything Many nights can pass but nothing Like tonight's moonlight splendor! Many kisses follow but nothing To match the hot mist! So much lust hidden deep within The heart's unquenchable thirst Biting the lips to unite with them I waited for eons to catch you in my net When the mind seeks The whirlpool of desires The silence that can decode the romance Or the youth that is brimming with energy Many nights can pass but nothing Like tonight's moonlight splendor! Many kisses follow but nothing To match the hot mist! I usher in the cold winds To clasp you tighter That's the only way to taste the nectar My cheeks pine for your nails Like a partner in crime This is a confluence that's endless The fatigue is so endearing Kiss your shyness goodbye, And welcome the new modesty Many nights can pass but nothing Like tonight's moonlight splendor! Many kisses follow but nothing To match the hot mist! Uh-huh! I told you to wait until after our wedding, right? Now be a good boy and get ready. We need to buy a gift for my friend. Bye! Oh, you are ready already? Shall we go? Why are you so dull, Siddharth? Is it because I asked for separate rooms? I don't like it if you are like this. After going back to the hotel, it's your wish. I won't stop you. I've said yes. Why are you still angry with me? There's a doppelganger who desires you. The bloody fellow is trying to separate us. What? Yes, in my dreams. Oh, in your dreams? Who, that Bipin? I saw it on TV the other day. He looks exactly like you. Not every dream becomes a reality. I can identify you even among 1,000 look-alikes. Are you shocked? What do you take me for? - Sir, sir... - Who locked the door? Someone has done it intentionally, sir. - Hey, come here. Open the door. - Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. Didn't you go out with your girlfriend in a cab earlier? How come you are back so soon? Any problem? Why did you bring me here when the event is going on there? Ishika, I have to tell you something. What is it? Ishika, where are you guys? I searched all over. Everyone is asking for you. - Why? - Did you forget about the girls' party? Oh! After that, you are coming with us to Hyderabad. Siddu will be alone then. Siddu himself told me to take you along with us. Okay, they are all waiting. Come soon. Is this what you wanted to tell me? Thank you for understanding. Bye. Oh, my! You came at the right time, Siddu. When I went to that hotel for an official event, I ran into Ishika and I didn't know what to do. Thank God you are here. But what is this, Siddu? You've come all the way to Bengaluru and you didn't even call me. After your engagement to Ishika, you forgot about me. By the way, Siddu, what is this whole thing about Michael and Bipin? I saw it on TV. The bloody, crooked fellow was with us like a snake. I can't believe what a cunning fellow he was. Ishika will not come with you. Yes, she is going to Hyderabad with Nikitha and she asked you to leave. She told me, and I'm telling you. It's getting late, my boss is waiting for me. Bye. I have to tell you something important. Come inside. The bank manager told me that Rs. 5 crore was deposited in your account. I got a doubt and went to your room to search and this is what I found. It looks like a visa application form. He is not here to live with my identity. Then? He wanted to use my identity and leave for the US. That fellow is playing with your life and is also misbehaving with Ishika. I can't tolerate this anymore. I'm going to tell them everything. No, Uncle. Our decisions should not put Manju's life in danger. Until my plan works out, my family should not come to know about this. It is my son's wedding next week. All of you should come, bring the kids too. Give this to you brother... No. Please inform your husband too. I don't even realize what I am doing. Don't forget. Dear, offer your prayers at the temple before distributing the invitation cards. - I will go. - You say so, but you won't go. That's why I'm reminding you... You've booked the party hall, call the decorators also. - I'll look into it. - They're calling me... Yes, Sister, tell me. Snake gourd curry... How many times have I told you to give up eating snake gourd? I was just telling Siddu that he has changed. She said that Siddharth has changed! Brother-in-law, why did you come all the way here? You could've called me. Call Siddu. Siddu? Siddu is home, isn't he? Why would I ask you to call him if he is there? Call him. Oh, no, I am stuck. Whom should I call now? The original or the duplicate? What are you thinking about? Call him. I should think... I'm calling him, yes. Tell me, Uncle. Sit. - Hello. - Is he home? Yes, he is. Give him the phone. Okay. Siddu, your dad is on call. Hello. If you are Siddharth, then who is at home? What have you done! You've brought a demon into our house. And you've put Manju, Ishika and everyone else in danger. Give me three days' time. I will solve everything. Until then, don't tell this to anyone. Trust me. Protecting our family was my responsibility until now. But from this moment on, it is your responsibility as well, Dad. Bipin, Siddharth will be discharged tomorrow. Does he have a sixth finger? Yes, he does. He is not Siddharth. He is Manju... Manjunath Hegde. What! You can leave the country even after killing Manju. As long as Siddharth is alive, he won't let me go. By this time, he must have planned something. What is the plan? Let him go ahead with his plan. Hello, Bipin. I have transferred the money to your offshore account. When are you sending me the details? I'll be there in a weeks' time, Douglas. I'll personally handover the locations of the dump. You already know that I will execute my plan on 15th August. If you don't share the dump details before that, then consider the deal canceled. Don't worry, Douglas. Tell your people that they are dealing with Bipin. Bring Bipin to Central Mall tomorrow at the fixed time. Will you be able to do this against Bipin? There's no other way, Dad. Siddu, are you ready? Shall we go? Where are you going? To buy the wedding chain. - We've already bought it, right? - Ishika's parents didn't like it. But they said they liked it. Now they don't. What is your problem? Why are you getting so angry? - Where are you going? - To buy a sari at Kalamandir. We've already bought it, right? Siddu didn't like it. That is why he called Ishika here so that he can buy what they both like. - What do you say? - Yes, Sister-in-law. - We are ready, shall we go? - I am also ready. Hey, Siddu, why are you going this way? We should go that way, right? Surprise. A surprise? What is this, Siddu? Ask your husband. Bipin, they don't know anything. Let them go. When I am acting as your son... your son is performing well as Manju. You are giving a better performance than us, you... Your son is trying to get Manju out and bring the NIA to Central Mall so that you can hand me over to them after giving me this injection. Is that what you wanted? - Hey, leave him. - Shut up! Hello, Dad. Hello, hello, hello, my friend! You are intelligent. You are playing the game that I started. I will end the game. You want your people but I only want myself. You wished to send me to replace Manju. A small change in the plan... You should go instead and die in the hands of the NIA. - Oh, no... - Please... You should die, my friend. Decide whether it is one... or four. All the best. Are you mad? You will die if you take Manju's place. I am ready to die for the sake of Manju and my family. Alert! Alert! What's happening? Guys, don't loose him. Hey, Manju, come fast. - Where is he? - We lost him. - There! - Get the car, fast. Bipin... Siddharth has taken Manju's place. This time you shouldn't let him go... Kill him. Who the hell are you guys? Turn right! Market Road! Unit 3, Unit 3... Come in. We are on him, yeah. Go. Go. Go fast. Go fast. Move in. Move in. Hey! You've arrived at your destination. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up! Only the place has changed, not the plan. Down on your knees... Get up. Don't move. Why did you stop me from telling everything to the NIA, Dad? Siddu... They won't let you off so easily if you tell them everything. They will trouble you in the name of inquiries, cases and interrogations. You've put him where he belongs. Now, everyone is where they belong. Think of it as a bad dream and let it go. Please try to understand... Please. Stop! Stop. He is packing. Okay. Are you ready, Manju? You're getting late. Siddu is on his way. - Ten minutes, Uncle. - Come fast. Uncle... Uncle... Uncle! Please, Michael, don't hurt him. Please, Michael... Manju, run... You wanted to take a selfie in Goa, Uncle? Come, let's take one. Manju... Where are you hiding? Tell me, Manju. Do you feel hurt, Manju? You are like my blood brother. Are you playing a cat-and-mouse game with me? Oh, no! If what I want has to happen, this mouse has to die, right? Michael, aren't we friends? I saw you as my brother. Please don't hurt me. Michael, I beg you. Let me go... Uncle... Uncle... Uncle... Manju... Manju! Hey, sixth finger! We are not friends and definitely not brothers. Just... Look-alikes. Siddu! Hello, hello, hello, savior! You're finally here. I've been waiting for you. Do you know what's the biggest mistake you made? Not informing the NIA about our doppelganger story. Now I'll kill you both, and I will make them believe that one of you is Bipin and that will put an end to Bipin in the eyes of the NIA. Who is the first lucky fellow to take my identity? Is it you... or him? Bipin... You can kill me, but leave Manju alone. Wow... What a friendship! You won't die for me but you will die for him? We three look the same, don't we? What is the difference? What is the difference? Is it because of his sixth finger? Manju! Now we are even. Siddu... Manju has become a tiger now. Manju! They say everyone in the world has seven look-alikes, called doppelgangers... Most of us don't know that there are some websites that can help us meet them. Now, the most wanted criminal... Bipin Roy, has used such a website to track down his look-alike, Siddharth, to use his identity in order to flee abroad. His attempts have failed. To give more details on this, the NIA will address the media soon. Thank God Bipin is dead. Imagine what would've happened otherwise! That monster came into our lives only because of this website. I found a friend thanks to this website. And I got you as well. Aren't we all happy now? But... Shall we stop talking about that and think about what's important? THE END
