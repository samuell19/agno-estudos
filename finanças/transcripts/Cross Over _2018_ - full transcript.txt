- C'mon man, we gotta get back before dark. - Got a flat tire. - I can't take him anywhere. Every time we do this, it's always something with him. - What's that, a pet rock? - It's a battery. - I don't care what it is. What, do you collect those now? - Okay, big boy. It's time for your big event. - Okay. - So you finally get to tell your side of the story, huh? - Let's just hope it works. - For your sake, it better. - What do you mean by that? - Hands out. For whatever it's worth, my mother thinks you're innocent. She's been followin' this. Well, let's be honest. She's been obsessed with this story ever since you got here. She thinks you got innocent eyes. - Innocent eyes? - She's 87 years old. She can't see anyway. - The moment you've been waiting for is finally... I sound so excited, huh? No, you sound great, hon. - Hey. - Hello. Thanks for remindin' me. He's already 35 minutes late. Think he backed out? - Not in a million years. - Who are you? I only agreed to meet with Mitch Wal... - Walters, yes. Mitch Walters. He had another engagement. - Guard. - Shape it up, soldier! - Who told you that, huh? Only my father would say that to me. I didn't do this! - You better calm down, big boy. I'll put you back in that cage. - I've done my homework. Your father was a good man. - No, he was a great man, a true war hero. - Indeed. So please, have a seat. Hello, I'm Sylvia Richards, your host from Live TV. You've asked for it and the moment is here. Flynn Michaels is finally here to tell his side of the story. Flynn, thank you for agreeing to meet with our network. While many may believe that you're innocent, I still believe you need to tell your side of the story: the real side. Not just I only saw that or I only heard this, everything. - Do you believe in ghosts? - Last year, I was the host of a successful food show on TV. Back at the hotel that night, my life took a fateful turn when I experienced my first encounter with a ghost. Not only did that ghost make me believe, but she left me wanting more. After that, I started hosting a paranormal TV series, "Restless Spirits." But I failed to learn one important fact before making that decision and it was too late by the time I did. Everyone is different, not just in this life, but more so in the next. Every ghost doesn't want to communicate and most have no desire to show themselves either. Maybe they're not ready to cross over. I'm not sure. - Do you know these people? - Yes. Yes, I do. - Continue telling me your story. We'll come back to the pictures. - Okay. So we decided to investigate this hotel in the middle of nowhere. It was just something we found out about. - Like a ghost hunt? - Well, sort of. See, we received an anonymous tip about a ghost that only appears once a year at this hotel, the Amargosa Hotel. - Today's the one-year anniversary, right? - Yeah, it is. - Ma'am. - She's on a stage headed south. - Where is he? - Hey, Max. - Hey. - Can you meet me over at the Maverick? - You want me to agree to out to that hotel tomorrow? - I want you to want to. I can't do this without you. - But there's no time to plan this out. Thank you. And we don't have a full team since Tina left. The paranormal is dangerous, Flynn. You never experienced the dark side. I know it's your show, but it's our lives. You're not thinking clearly. - You sure the place is still open? - It's open. It's been open a long time. - Then what's the rush? The red carpet probably blew away years ago. Zane said this ghost only comes out once a year. Tonight is the night. - He also told you no one else will go near this place tonight. We should've waited until he could check this place out. Why do you only take me to the beach, darling, when the sharks come ashore? - What's the story with the new girl? - Ah, Lena. My little enticing protege, she's a psychic. You'll like her. - It's the network. Hello. - What up? This is Jason from the network. - Yes. - I heard about your little stunt there. You wanna go out in the desert and do some kinda ghost hunting thing out there? Now Flynn, this is important. We need to assess the risk and protect ourselves. I'm gonna send out a representative from the insurance company. His name's Koco Steele and I'll see you soon. Gotta go right now. - All right. -, bye bye. - What did you do wrong now, Flynn? - Was that Jason? - They're sending some guy from the insurance company out here to meet us. They want to "assess the risk" as he said. - I'm not surprised, Flynn. They're accustomed to sharp knives and hot stoves on the old show, so they want to see what we're doing now. - She's right, Flynn. The world shall not end. - I don't like it. If you're not on the team, you don't belong there. I don't need anyone getting in the way when the action heats up and asking a lot of questions. - He's right, Cass. The end of the world is at hand. - Stay out of it, Max. It's not the end of the world. - Where ya headed? - Amargosa Hotel. - Same place we're going. Hop in if you want. - Thanks. The name's Koco Steele. I'll grab my stuff. - Koco Steele? You're the guy the insurance company sent out from the network? - Yes, and that makes you Flynn. Can't begin to... Are you kiddin' me? - Where is he? - I don't know where he is. - Don't you, indeed. - I beg your pardon, sir, if I was obscure. I admire your audacity, madam. Hell, I praise your spirit. Be a shame if I had to remove it from ya. - You're the only ones staying here tonight. I'm gonna go and get the rest of the keys and then you can make yourselves comfortable, okay? Son of a bitch. Hey, longhair. You want your own room or you wanna bunk with me? - Thank you, Grace. You're too young for me. - Damn right I am. - This is a hoax and nothing but a joke. There's nothing here, Flynn. No one stays here anymore. I'll bet this is all a publicity stunt. - Can you believe her? Where did they dig her up? - Don't change the subject, Flynn. - I'm not changin' the subject, Cass. We're here. Let's investigate and do what we do. On with the show. - There's no way something put a do not disturb sign out there all by itself. It's probably Grace and she's too wasted to remember. - Don't be so sure. - All right, here's your keys. Stay in whatever room you'd like, I don't care. - Thank you, Grace. - Okay. Oh, there's some dude out there with a stick up his ass askin' for you all. - Koco. - Thank you, he's with us. We're expecting another member of our crew too. She should be arriving soon. - Great. I'll go hold the door open for her. Got nothin' better to do. - Thank you so much for leaving me out there, Flynn. Very funny. Luckily I found some ride-in with some sorta goat farmer. - I apologize, Koco. It wasn't my idea, nor did I approve. - Sure and I prefer Mr. Steele. For the record, guys: The network's okay with me being here. And as you know, I'm just here to protect the interest of the network and your insurance company. - Right. - So you met the lady at the hotel, you met the other guy from the network, some type of risk manager from the insurance company? - Yes, Koco. Koco Steele. - Right. Please tell me more about him. - Where do I start? I really wasn't a big fan of this guy, at least to begin with. He never trusted us, never gave us room. Essentially, he disrespected our craft. - I asked Grace to send Lena over when she gets here. This is incredible. Grace tells me it's all one woman's work. She spent almost six years just to paint this in here. The Opera House. - She sounds like someone who knows how to stick with what she started. - Did Koco see you walk over? - I don't think so. He's probably in his room checking for unsafe conditions. - You're not going to be able to hide from him all night. - I'm not trying to hide from him, Cass. Just keepin' a safe distance. - Max? - Lena, you made it here. Enter, my baby. You must have met Grace. - Ooh, yes. Charming. - Come. Let me introduce you to the others. Lena, this is Flynn, the show's host. - Yes. Yes, you are. Fascinating. - Hello, Lena. It's a pleasure. - And this is Cassie, the show's executive producer. - Delighted, Lena. Max tells me you're a psychic. Can you tell me what I'm thinking? - Well, Cassandra, you were thinking of standing up to greet me, but you wanted to wait for me to come to you. This way, I'll know who's the boss and everyone knows right where they stand. - Welcome to the team. So what's the plan? - Oh no, Detective Steele. - Sorry, Flynn. Couldn't wait for you to mail the invitation. So what are we doin'? - This is Koco. He's with the insurance company. The network sent him out. - It's gettin' late quick. What's the plan? - You're right. Max briefed you on everything that's going on here? - Completely. - Our focus is room number nine. Every year on this night, a ghost moves into that room and no one will go near it. Max, like we talked about on the way over, I want you on camera tonight. - Okay. - Lena, I want you to cover the EVPs. - You didn't tell Zane you were coming out. - It's not a requirement and it's my show. He wanted to find out more about the place and I don't wanna miss the opportunity. - It only happens once a year. - So what, Koco? What's the damn point? - It seems poorly planned, maybe a bit foolish. - You sound like an ass to me. Who even wanted you here? - Your insurance company along with the network. - We'll find another insurance company. - Whatever you want, boss. But until you do, you're stuck with me. - I'm not stuck with anything. - Why don't you tell what happened to the girl in the last episode? What happened to her? - Get off my back, Koco. - It's okay, wasn't expecting a good answer. I got all the facts anyway. - Shove your facts up your ass! - It is not necessary to speak to me like that. - It's not necessary for you to be here either. - Except for being wrong, you're right. - What do you want, Lena? - Nothing. Max tells me there's an opening and I asked to join the team, so I'm here. - I didn't know you were a psychic and into the paranormal. - Of course you did. - How so? - You were just thinking if I'm wearing panties. Nobody's listening, just me. That's exactly what you were thinking. - I don't know what to say. - Why say anything? You're here, I'm here. Ghosts are waiting. And since you are wondering, I'm not wearing any tonight. - I wasn't thinking that. - Sure. - Perhaps it is I who is bein' obscure. The gentleman's whereabouts are of grave importance to me. I seek to find that information out, one way or the other. Now as I ask politely one final time, where is he? - He didn't take me into his confidence on that matter. - Enough! Would you rather me throw you down and smash your head on the floor, then I could pick the pieces of recollections up or the memories which I seek? This is not a game! My words may have resembled a question, you may have believed you had a choice in whether or not which to answer, but I can assure you, you do not! Now, right now. You can have the choice which you so humbly demanded upon me, you can have the choice to take your next breath or you can provide me with the answer I asked for so cordially in the beginnin'. But you cannot, my lady, have both! Are we ready for that drink yet? - Do your worst, but I shall never betray him. - Never? Never's a lot like forever. Nothin' lasts that long. Regretfully I know someone far more persuasive. - Lena, can you check please? I got one, three, four, but I got no signal on camera two. - Sure, I'm plugging it in right now. - No. - Nor have I. - Nothing. - How 'bout now? - There it is. Okay. Can you move it down a little bit, please? - Here? - A little bit more. Good, that's it. A little bit up. Sorry. Okay, we got it. Perfect. - Looks good. - Yeah. - Max, I wanna pick up some more introductory shots. - You wanna check with Koco first? - Bite me, Max. - Grab the camera. - Rolling. - Okay, here we go. Lost my train of thought. - Okay. - Back it up. - That's okay. - Okay. We good? - Yeah. - Okay. The infamous room nine, Amargosa Hotel. Night has fallen and we're setting up to investigate. Once a year, every year on this night, no one, absolutely no one will go into that room. Join us as we venture into the unknown and go places no one else has gone before. - Okay, ready. - Okay. I want you to get a good shot on the doorknob. Get a good shot. - Okay. - Okay, here we go. - Rolling. - The haunted legend that we're following tells us a spirit makes its presence known every year by hangin' a do not disturb sign on the door. Knowing the crew of restless spirits, not one ghost will be sleeping tonight. Cut it right there. How was that? - I like it. - You sure? - Yeah. - Should we do it again? - Do we have the static camera set up on that doorknob yet? - Go easy, Cass. We're just about set up. - I'm just trying to make sure we don't miss the money shot, Flynn. Can already picture Grace's hand reaching around the door. - That's what we're trying to do, Cassandra. We haven't had you here... - Don't even say it. I've been in that skirt all day. - Cassie, connect this to the DVR and we're in business. - Flynn, look. - Where's he hiding? - He's not hiding and I shall tell you nothin' more. - We'll see. - You'll find him at the Amargosa hotel. Room number nine. - Camera's good, camera's rolling. - Equipment's ready. - Everything's rolling. - We're all ready? - You'll probably be more comfortable outside. - I'd be a lot more comfortable on the beach in Rio. What's the point? - Lena, hit the lights please. - Rio and $10 a day with no hair. - If there's somebody in the room, can you please make a noise now? Can you tell me why you hang that do not disturb sign on the doorknob? - Any violent attacks in this room? - Tell us why you haunt this room on this day every year. Did somebody you love die in this room? - I'm gettin' nothin' on the mel meter. - If you're the one that hung the do not disturb sign on the door, please give us a sign. - You know, I really thought this is the one. - I expected more after we saw the sign. - How much longer do you want to stay here, Flynn. - What, you gonna say I told you so again? - There's nothing here. - I don't think we're gonna find anything. I'll probably go to sleep. - Maybe... Maybe I'll go snoop around a little bit. - Guys, lemme give it a try by myself please. - Fine by me. - All right. - Good luck. - Okay spirit, unknown infamous spirit of room number nine, I'm here all by myself and we've seen nothing. Nothing. But for whatever reason on the night supposedly everything goes down, I get nothing? C'mon, gimme somethin'. Show me something. Show me somethin'. We're not here to hurt you. That's what I thought. Quite honestly, maybe Cassandra is right. This was a waste of time, waste of money Guys, pack it up. We're done. - Cassandra your girlfriend? - Yes. Well, was. I don't wanna talk about that right now. - Let's carry on. - So we went back to the room and that's when things started getting a little weird. - The ratings'll be sizzling on this episode, Flynn. - Not now, Cass. - How about now? - Get off it, Cassandra! You were right, okay? You were fu... I'm sorry, I... - I still love you. - I know, but... - Go plug in the cameras. See if we caught any fish. I'm gonna jump in the shower. - Can you see better now? - You know, different lenses see different things Is that camera clear? I'm wanna snoop around a little bit. Gotta be some action here somewhere. - Gimme a minute and I'll get the card out. - All right, I'll be back in a little bit. - Flynn? Really. Something isn't... - Cass, did you by chance happen to use that shower any other time today? - No, why? - I don't know, I'm not sure yet. - Flynn, something was in the shower with me. - Like what? - I don't know "Like what?" But I'm scared. - Look. - When did you take the camera in the bathroom? - I didn't. The camera turned itself on and that's what I found on it. - That's not possible. - Well then you took another shower today and Max followed you in. - But I didn't, Flynn. I don't like this. Let's get outta here. - No, no. I tried to copy the video to the laptop, too. It won't do it. The computer insists there's no file to copy. - Don't tell me any more. Oh my god, it's watching us. Turn it off! - All right. - Flynn, say something. - What the hell do you want me to say? I don't know what's goin' on. The camera can see what it sees. Not everything, just pieces. - It. - It, the ghost from room nine. The one that told us to stay out. - I told us to stay out! You don't listen! - I know you're here. - You're afraid. - I'm not afraid. - I know who you are, Max. Do you know who I am? - Do you know that I did not sleep one night through since I was a child? And you ask if I know who you are. You wanna play? I'm all-in. - Hang on. What'd we do wrong now? I mean, what did I do wrong? - Relax, Flynn. I heard someone yellin' as I was walkin' by. Okay. - Show him the video. Tell him what's goin' on. - Nothing's going on. - Look at the camera. - No. Something's watching us. - That's horrifying. You're right, we're doomed. - I don't understand. Nothing. - Koco, we both saw recordings on there of me in the shower and then the two of us sitting here on the couch, but we didn't shoot any of it. - Then who did? - Flynn thinks the camera may be picking up what the ghost sees. - The ghost. - Yes. - Which ghost? - Room nine. - Of course. I forgot about that dramatic encounter from earlier. You guys should call the cops. It's gettin' too late for this. - If a digital voice recorder can pick up voices out of our hearing range, why can't a video camera pick up images that are unseen to us? - Is that possible? - I don't know. I guess. - What is it? - Somethin' at the back of the hotel. Maybe it doesn't know it sees what we see. - Now what? - Get dressed. It's over here. We need to go this way. - I'm not sure what that means, Flynn. What's in there? - I don't know exactly, Koco. I'm seeing somethin' on camera that I didn't film before and this is the door I saw. I don't know how it's possible, but it must mean somethin'. We should check it out. - If you insist. - Move. - Flynn, wait for me. - Fuck no, you didn't just do that. - Koco. - That's goin' in my report, you little crap sandwich. - It wasn't me. Fuck, Koco. It wasn't me. It wasn't my fault. Down here. It's down here. Down here. Koco, stop right there. Move to your left a little. Something is followin' us. No, my left, dammit. - Bitch. - Do what I mean, not what I say. - Don't piss me off, Flynn. Your policy's about to expire. Whoa! Flynn! - Help, open up! - What the hell was that? Open this damn door! - Are you okay? - Lemme out, Flynn! - Are you okay, Cassandra? - Lemme out! - What was that? - I don't know. - What the fuck was that? - Koco! Koco, can you hear me? - Flynn, I'm gonna rip you in half... - Are you all right? - ...when I get outta here! Let me outta here. - Koco, open the door. - Open the door right now, Flynn. - That's what I'm doing. - Open! - Flynn! - Koco! - Door's jammed shut. - Get out! - I can't get out. - It's stuck! It won't budge! - Something's in the room with me. - There's gotta be somethin' to open it with. - Yeah then you try it, Cassandra. - Get us out of here, Flynn! - I'm trying. - We are not alone. - This doesn't make any sense. What was that? Lena, that's it. Lena and Max'll come look for us. - Yeah, yeah. - We're gonna be fine. Wait, how is this... - Flynn? - How is this showing her? - Is that you? - You have cameras in her room? - Yeah, I needed to make sure we covered all our bases. - Flynn, did Cassie kick you out already? - What is she... - It's not... - What's she talking about? - I don't know. - Flynn, come here. I know you want me. - Flynn. - Come to bed. I won't tell. - Did you have an affair with Lena? - Flynn, is that you? Flynn, did Cassie kick you out already? She found out you cheated with me? - How could you do that? - I was... - You were what? - I was drunk, all right? - You were what? Oh that's a good fucking excuse, huh? - All right, this happened... - And then you bring her on the team? Are you joking me right now? - I didn't bring her on the team, Cassandra. I did not. - Then how did she get here? She was gonna be here. - Help, help! - I am not afraid of you. - Koco, can you hear me? Somebody! - Help, help! - And this, this is how you repay me. Are you serious? - What's goin' on? You guys okay? - Yeah, don't worry, Koco. I'm fine, but Flynn's gonna fucking die. - Cassandra, I'm sorry. - Save your fucking pity, all right? - I am sorry. - Fuck you. Koco, get me outta here right now! Help! - It's stuck! It won't budge! - Cassandra, I know you're upset and you have every right to be. But we need to figure out a way to get outta this predicament. - Why don't you figure out a way to get us outta this predicament since you're the one who got us into it? All of it. - You're right. Wait a minute. - Oh my god, what's happening to her? Flynn. - She's being attacked. We've gotta find another way out. - Flynn, we could be next. I told you this was a trap. - Listen. - I told you. - Listen, relax. What the hell? - Oh my god. - Go, go, go. - Oh my god, what's happening to her? - No. No! No! No! - Koco! Koco! Look! It's attacking Lena! - Lena! Lena! - I'm calling for help. - Nice try, sister. No cell service. - What's going on here?! - We need to get out of here now. - Now you're talkin' my language, Flynn. Let's do it. - What about Max? - He's gone too. - What? What do you mean, Flynn? - How do you know that? - It's just a feeling I have. I don't know. - We can't leave 'em here alone. - All right, I'll go check. You two go grab whatever crap you need and get the fuck outta here. - Koco. Hey, don't disappear. Cass. - What are you gonna say, Flynn? Honestly I wanna tell you to leave me alone, but timing's real bad, you know? Can you tell me why? - I don't know, but I know we can get through this. - Yes if get through the night, yeah. I'm with you on that. Stay here, I'll go back to the room and grab our stuff. - Cass, make it quick please. - No sign of Max, no sign of anyone. I checked everywhere. - A little weird? This is fascinating. - Well, everything happened so fast. We started to run wherever just tryin' to get away from this thing. - The ghost, I presume. - What do we do now, Flynn? - I don't know. Call the network. Call the police. At this point, who knows? - Thanks for not leaving me behind. - Koco, look. - What the fuck is that? - That's Lena. - Unless your ghost friend took her to the mall clothes shoppin', that's not her, my buddy. - Flynn, don't you stop. - Bad idea, boss. - We can't leave her here, Cass. - Shit. - Do you see anything? - Nah, nothin'. - Let's get outta here. I wanna go. - You see her? - Can't tell. Thought I saw somethin', but now I don't see anything. - What are you doing? - We can't leave her, Cass. We have to go back. - Why do we have to go back and look? - Dammit Cassandra, why do you have to be like this? - Stop yelling at me! - If it wasn't for what we said, we can do this. - Start driving. We need to go home. I wanna go home. - All right, Cassandra. If it wasn't for everything I told you about this. - All right! - You know what? I don't even give a shit about that right now. I just wanna get home safe. - All right. Flynn, let's go. - Thank you. Lena! - It's not her. - Lena! - Flynn. - Cassandra, wait. - I fuckin' quit. Let's go. Really not in the mood for this, Flynn. Get us outta here. - What are you doing? - It won't start! - Fuck, I'm really not into this. - What are we gonna do? - Well unless you got a better idea, we're walkin'. Leavin' now. - Did you change your boots? - Yes, I had to fucking change my boots. Enough walking. - Flynn. - What is it? - We're back at my car. - I just need to sit for a moment, Koco. - That doesn't matter 'cause it won't fuckin' start! - Let's start walkin'. - I'm not getting in that car. - No, don't. - You gotta get off this road. - We need to get moving! - You won't make it. It's been followin' us the whole time. - What does that even mean? - If you cut through there, it's the shortest distance back to town, as the crow flies. - As the crow flies? - Go that way, run as fast as you can. - What are you doin'? - Getting you home. - You're not getting in that car, are you? - That's the plan. - "Bad idea, boss." Sound familiar? - It's not a bad idea for everyone. Get movin'. Get outta here while you still can! Take her and go. Lemme do this, please. - What took you so long? Go ahead, make yourself comfortable. - Stop resisting. - It's Mr. Steele. We're not friends. - Sorry pal, can't stand that station. - Sorry to disturb you, but your lady won't be joining you tonight. - I gotta be still for a minute, catch my breath I don't hear anything. - We probably wouldn't. - Do you see something? - No. - What are we gonna do? - Keep going and stay alive. - What is it? - We're being followed. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. - That's good. - You sure? Shh, shh, shh. It's right behind us. Let's go. We gotta go, we gotta go now. Let's go, c'mon! He can't find us. - Then let's go. - I'm just gonna touch you up a little. - Oh thanks, Julie. - Since we're on a commercial break, why don't you tell me a little bit about you? You seem to know everything about me. - Well, I was raised in the Midwest. My father was a minister. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Your father was a minister? - That's right. - What are you doin' filming an interview like this? - Look, I'm not here to hit you over the head with a Bible, okay? I'm here to help. That's what I do. - Do you believe me? - Look, for what it's worth, your story is truly compelling. I don't know what happened. There's no evidence. But I do think... I do think you're being forthright. - Forthright. I apologize. I'm just frustrated. - It's fine. It's fine. How's the food in this place? - It's horrible. What I would die for some home-cooked meals. - Not my home-cooked meals. Enrique, what are you doing? We've got like 30 seconds left. - No, there's something goin' on here. I'm not kidding. Come here, look. Look. - There's nothing there. What're you talking about? How many times do I have to tell you this is live. I have to get another camera guy or what? - What's goin' on, Sylvia? There's somethin' there. He saw somethin' in the viewfinder. This isn't good. - There was nothing there. - It's the one-year anniversary. He saw something. He saw something! - There was nothing there. I just checked it! - What is this place? - I don't know. I've never been out this far. - I need to sit down and rest. I can't keep running. Do you really know the way back to town from here? - Honestly Cass, I'm not completely sure. - This is when you finally decide to start being honest with me? - That's not what I meant. - That is what I meant. - Cass. - Don't even think about crying. - I wasn't going to cry. - Yeah? Well maybe you should. - What do you want me to say? - Anything other than how sorry you are would be a damn good start. - Cass, I didn't mean to hurt you. That's refreshing. What would have done to me if you did? What was that? - I don't know. - You think it's still trying to find us? - Probably, but I don't think it can. - See anything? - No. - Why did it come after us like that? - Punishment I guess. - It may have started out that way, but it turned into something else at some point. Something... with a greater sense of purpose. - Maybe you're right. But it just seems like a game to me. - What are we gonna do when we get back? Where do we even start? - Over. We start over. Cass! Cassandra! - Help! I can't move. - I'm here. I'll get you outta here, Cass. I promise, I'll get you outta here. - Ow, it's hurting me! - What do you want from us? Leave her alone! - Help me, Flynn. Pull, pull. - Come on. You can't have her! Take us both! You want us so bad? Take us both! - Oh my god. Are you okay? Thank you. Thank you. - I thought I lost you. - Never. Never. Finally. Hmm, service with a smile. - It's Zane. Hello? - Flynn, did you get my messages? Stay away from that hotel. Everyone said it's far too dangerous. - Yeah, we know. Can we get a ride into town, please? - Please, it's important. - Okay, let's go. Y'all runnin' from the law or somethin'? - No, nothin' like that. - Well I am. Just kiddin' you. - I'm sure our viewers would agree, your story is truly compelling. Tell me more about Cassandra. But before you do, I just wanna say I think that it's very chivalrous of you, the way you defended her in court. I wish you would've had that same type of passion for your own testimony. - I love her. I cannot express in words how much I love her. If she is listening... - There's a good chance. - If you have moved on, I understand. But just remember: - And I mean always love you. - She knows. Thank you, Flynn. One last question. Hindsight being 20/20, would you have done anything different? - No. - Well America, you heard it for yourself, the story of Flynn Michaels. Now you be the judge. Flynn. - Hey look. What's this? - What the hell? - Change her mind. - This is the spooky house. I think they've always called it that, but we just carry on the tradition. What the hell is that out there? Who took a crap out here? - Are you serious? - Why is that light flickering like this? - Which one, do you know? - No answer. Can you make the lights flicker more? You have trouble, see? Make it turn it off. - Can we turn it off please? - If you were powerful, you can make that turn off. Show us what you can do. C'mon, all the way off. I wouldn't be in for this, I really wouldn't. - I know. - What do I do? C'mon, turn it off. Do it. Give it to me. - What the hell? - Do it. - That's cool. No, we like it. Go twice. - Can you shut the light off please? Oh my. - Dude. - C'mon, turn it off. Turn it off. - Do we have that? Oh, crazy. - Are you the person they call The Boss? Turn it up high. - Can you hear that? - Mm-hmm. - If you're happy we're here, flicker the light. - If you wanna believe, look at the light. Oh my god. - On the count of three, watch 'em turn it off. One, two, three. - Question. - Could it be running on the roof right now? - I don't know. I'm gonna go fuckin' find out right now. - Is the roof slanted? - Wow, that's something that we wanna do. Screw you, I'm fucked. - Shut it off. - It's like at the. - Woo, smell that? - Next. - What's up, Travis? - Yeah, that's good. - Look at us. - You almost left it in, didn't you? - Heard ya helpin'. - Dude. - And then just hand it to my hand. - That's some serious stuff.
