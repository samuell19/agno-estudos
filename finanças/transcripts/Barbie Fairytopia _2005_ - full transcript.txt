Narrator: JUST THROUGH THE RAINBOW FROM THE WORLD WE KNOW.... LIES FAIRYTOPIA. [YAWNS] [LAUGHING] [WHISPERING] [PIXIES GIGGLING] HEY, WHAT DO YOU CALL A FAIRY WITHOUT WINGS? I DON'T KNOW, WHAT? NOTHING!! WHO'D WANT TO CALL A WINGLESS FAIRY?! [ALL LAUGHING] [CHITTERING ANGRILY] DON'T EVEN BOTHER, BIBBLE. THEY'RE NOT WORTH IT. WHAT'S THE MATTER, ELINA? JEALOUS? All: WHOOOOOOAAAAAA! HEH HEH HEH! THANKS, DANDELION. DON'T LET 'EM GET TO YOU. COURSE NOT. SO, WHAT DID THE FAIRIES WANT? IT WAS WEIRD. THEY SAID WE SHOULD GO HOME RIGHT AWAY. REALLY? WHY? SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN THE MAGIC MEADOW? HMM! LOOKS FINE TO ME. YEAH, TO ME, TOO. MAYBE THEY WERE PLAYING A JOKE ON US OR SOMETHING. YEAH. MAYBE. AH... AH... AH-CHOO! OW! AAH. HEY, SEE THAT SEED POD? YEAH. ALL THE WAY TO THE GROUP OF FLOWER SPRITES, JUST PAST THE PURPLE ROCK. EASY! READY TO PLAY CATCHER? OHH! YAHOO! [BABBLING] AAH! ROH ROH ROH! [GASPS] UHH! OOH! OHH! BIBBLE! ARE YOU OK? [PURRING, CHUCKLING] UNH! TA-DA! HA HA HA HA! OHH! HEY, YOU, DANDELION! HEY! YOU GUYS COME BACK FOR MORE? OK, HELLO! WE'RE TRYING TO DO YOU A FAVOR. BUT HEY, IF YOU DON'T CARE THAT TOPAZ HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED, THAT'S FINE WITH US. Both: WAIT! TOPAZ HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED? THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S SAYING. HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED THAT YOU'RE LIKE THE ONLY FAIRIES OUT IN THE MEADOW? HAS ANYONE TOLD THE ENCHANTRESS? PLEASE. LIKE THE ENCHANTRESS NEEDS US TO TELL HER WHAT'S GOING ON IN FAIRYTOPIA. WAIT. WHY ARE YOU TELLING US THIS? IT'S ALMOST...NICE. LOOK, JUST BECAUSE WE MAKE FUN OF YOU, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE WANT TO SEE YOU AND NO-FLY-ZONE HERE KIDNAPPED BY LAVERNA. OH, COME ON. SHE DOESN'T REALLY EXIST. IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO THINK... SUIT YOURSELF. WE'RE GOING HOME, WHERE IT'S SAFE. COME ON, PIXIES. [CHITTERING] I'M NOT SURE. LAVERNA'S JUST A MYTH, RIGHT? SHE CAN'T BE REAL. I DIDN'T THINK SO, BUT... MAYBE I SHOULD GO ASK MY MOM, JUST IN CASE. ARE YOU OK GETTING BACK TO PEONY? OF COURSE. OK. SEE YOU LATER! HI, PEONY. [CHITTERING ANGRILY] I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT THOSE PIXIES SAID, BIBBLE. I MEAN, TOPAZ CAN'T REALLY BE KIDNAPPED. SHE'S TOO POWERFUL, AND SHE'S A GUARDIAN. RIGHT? BIBBLE? [SNORING AND MUMBLING] HA HA HA. AT LEAST ONE OF US WILL GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] A LULLABY. PEONY, YOU ALWAYS KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO. [YAWNS] LAVERNA? LAVERNA? ERR, I KNOW YOU'RE HERE. LAVERNA? YOU CALLED, TOPAZ? SORRY I TOOK SO LONG. I WAS JUST PUTTING TOGETHER A LITTLE SNACK FOR US. CAN I INTEREST YOU IN SOME BUTTERCUP MILK AND AMBROSIA? I'D PREFER MY FREEDOM, THANKS. [MOCKING] "I'D PREFER MY FREEDOM, THANKS." AH, BUT PEOPLE DO GET TESTY WHEN THEY'RE LONELY. A TOAST TO THE END OF YOUR LONELINESS. SOON I'LL BRING YOU THE COMPANY OF ALL YOUR FELLOW GUARDIANS. WON'T THAT BE NICE? THEN YOU'LL ALL BE TOGETHER TO WATCH ME TAKE OVER FAIRYTOPIA. YOU'LL NEVER TAKE OVER FAIRYTOPIA. THE FAIRIES ARE ALL LOYAL TO THE ENCHANTRESS. OH, THAT'S RIGHT! WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT? OH, WAIT. I DID THINK OF THAT. FUNGUS! HEH HEH. YES... YOUR EVILNESS? YES... YOUR MOST... VILE WICKEDNESS? SHOW OUR GUEST THE MERCHANDISE. [CHAINS RATTLING] UNH! UHH! UNH! UHH! Laverna: BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T IT? MY FORMULA. IT HAS THE AMAZING POWER TO WEAKEN EVERY FLYING CREATURE IN FAIRYTOPIA. THOSE WHO BREATHE IT BECOME SO WEAK THAT THEY START TO LOSE THE POWER TO FLY. BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. ISN'T IT? AT THIS VERY MOMENT, MY MINIONS ARE IN ALL 7 REGIONS OF FAIRYTOPIA. LITTLE BY LITTLE, THE WEAKNESS WILL SET IN EVERYWHERE. IMAGINE. A WHOLE LAND OF FAIRIES WEAK, FLIGHTLESS, AND FRIGHTENED. AND WHO WILL BE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN HELP THEM? NOT THEIR BELOVED ENCHANTRESS AND FAIRY GUARDIANS. OH, NO. HA HA HA HA. THE ONLY ONE TO ANSWER THEIR DESPERATE CRIES FOR HELP, THE ONLY ONE WITH AN ANTIDOTE TO THEIR SICKNESS WILL BE ME. AND ALL OF FAIRYTOPIA WILL LOVE ME FOR IT. SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO RETHINK THAT AMBROSIA. SINCE I'LL SOON BE YOUR QUEEN, IT'D BE BETTER FOR EVERYONE IF WE ALL JUST GOT ALONG. DON'T YOU THINK? [BIBBLE BABBLING] ELINA, BABBA BIBBLE DEE. AAH! AAH! HEE HEE HEE! BIBBLE, YOU STARTLED ME! [CHITTERING EXCITEDLY] ♪ LA LA LA LA LA ♪ YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S STRANGE THAT SHE DIDN'T SING TO WAKE US UP. [GASPS] PEONY! I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THIS IS HORRIBLE! IT'S EVERYWHERE. THE WHOLE MAGIC MEADOW. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT IS, BUT NOW SOME FAIRIES ARE HAVING TROUBLE FLYING. HAS ANYONE TOLD TOPAZ? TOPAZ IS GONE. THE CLOSEST GUARDIAN IS AZURA, AND SHE'S ALL THE WAY IN FAIRY TOWN. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE FLOWERS? WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO PEONY? I'M SORRY. I KNOW HOW MUCH SHE MEANS TO YOU. I THINK-- I THINK I HAVE TO GO TO FAIRY TOWN. WHAT?! [CHITTERING] ELINA, YOU CAN'T GO TO FAIRY TOWN. YOU'VE NEVER EVEN LEFT THE MAGIC MEADOW. [BIBBLE CHITTERING] THE TRIP TAKES HOURS, AND THAT'S IF YOU'RE FLYING AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE GOING! BLAH BLAH, BLIP YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY GO ALL BY YOURSELF! I WON'T. I'LL BE WITH BIBBLE. [GRUMBLING] BE WITH BIBBLE? BELIEVE ME, I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT EITHER. [WHIMPERING SOFTLY] OF COURSE YOU CAN. AND I'M COMING WITH YOU! THANKS, DANDELION. NO PROBLEM! LET'S DO IT! [CHITTERING NERVOUSLY] EEP! WOW. NO WONDER I NEVER WANTED TO LEAVE THE MEADOW. IT'S KIND OF SPOOKY IN HERE. [STRANGE ANIMAL CALLS] AAH! AAH! [BABBLING SOFTLY] ERR, NO! I'M NOT SCARED, EITHER. I THINK WE'RE LOST. I'LL FLY UP AND HAVE A LOOK. HEY, ELINA, I THINK I SEE A WAY. IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE. HUH? UNH. WHAT'S GOING ON? AAH! [GASPS] OHH! AAH! UHH! UNH! DANDELION, ARE YOU OK? MAYBE I JUST NEED TO REST FOR A SECOND. AND THEN YOU SHOULD GO BACK HOME. AND LEAVE YOU AND BIBBLE? NOT A CHANCE. DANDELION, IT HAS TO BE THE SICKNESS. YOU NEED TO GO HOME WHILE YOU STILL CAN. NO. IF I CAN'T FLY, I'LL WALK, LIKE YOU. HUH, THAT'S CRAZY. I'M USED TO WALKING. YOU'RE NOT. IT WOULD BE TOO HARD FOR YOU. BESIDES, IF YOU AREN'T HOME BY DARK, I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR MOM WOULD DO. SHE'D PANIC. WILL YOU BE OK WITHOUT ME? WE'RE CLOSE NOW. WE'LL BE FINE. BE CAREFUL. OK? I WILL. I PROMISE. GOOD-BYE! HONESTLY, RUBY, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I AM YOU'VE STOPPED BY. WHICH WILL IT BE: MARIGOLD MUFFINS OR FLOWER FLUFFERNUTTERS? THE FLUFFERNUTTERS ARE REALLY VERY GOOD. [CHEWING] MMMM. WHAT? WHATEVER YOU'RE PLANNING, THE ENCHANTRESS WILL NEVER LET YOU GET AWAY WITH IT. AH, RIGHT, THE ENCHANTRESS. MY DEAR, DEAR SISTER. ETERNAL BOND THAT JOINS ME TO MY TWIN... SHOW ME MY SISTER! [GASPS] ENCHANTRESS! OH, PLEASE. DON'T GET YOUR WINGS IN A BUNCH. SHE'S FINE. JUST VERY, VERY WEAK. SILLY GIRL ACTUALLY BELIEVED ME WHEN I SWORE I WANTED TO MAKE PEACE. NEVER SAW IT COMING WHEN I SLIPPED SOME OF MY FORMULA IN HER BUTTERCUP MILK. HUH, I GUESS SHE STILL HAS A SOFT SPOT FOR ME. MWAH! [BLOWS] SO, RUBY, YOU'D BE WISE TO JOIN TOPAZ AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY HOSPITALITY. AFTER ALL, YOU'LL BE LIVING UNDER MY RULE FOR... OH, I DON'T KNOW, SAY...FOREVER? HA HA HA HA HA! [EVIL LAUGHTER ECHOING] [CHITTERING] AFTER THE HEDGEROW, THEY SAY, "FAIRY WINGS WILL GUIDE YOUR WAY," BUT I DON'T SEE FAIRIES ANYWHERE. UNH! HUNH! UHH! UNH! [SIGHS] OH, WHERE ARE WE NOW? I DON'T KNOW. BIBBLE, YOU'RE A GENIUS! OH. [CHITTERING] "THE FAIRY WINGS WILL GUIDE YOUR WAY." AHEM! HUH? HELLO! HI, I'M ELINA, AND-- I'M SORRY, YOU NEED TO LEAVE. CITY HALL IS CLOSED. OHH! BIBBLE, WE'RE HERE. NOW WE CAN SEE AZURA. OUT OF THE QUESTION! NO ONE IS SEEING AZURA. NOT WITH THE SICKNESS GOING AROUND. SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE. SO BE A SMART FAIRY AND RUN ALONG HOME LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. BUT, SIR-- GOOD-BYE! BIBBLE, IF WE CAN'T SEE AZURA, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? Quill: LARKSPUR! FINALLY! WE JUST RECEIVED A MESSAGE. RUBY AND AMYTHYST HAVE BEEN TAKEN. I NEED YOU TO FLY TO AZURA AND BRING HER THE NEWS... IMMEDIATELY. ERR, UH, YES, SIR. RIGHT AWAY, SIR. AS FOR YOU TWO-- OHH? [GASPS] WE CAN'T LOSE HIM.

LEAVE IMMEDIATELY, OR I'M CALLING MY GUARDS. UH, NO! I MEAN... I'M ELINA, AND THIS IS BIBBLE, AND I'M SORRY IF WE STARTLED YOU. WE CAME ALL THE WAY FROM THE MAGIC MEADOW. OUR GUARDIAN IS MISSING, OUR FAIRIES CAN'T FLY, AND THE FLOWERS, MY HOME... I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO. COME TO THE WINDOW. SLOWLY. [GASPS] COME IN. COME IN. OH, YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED! Elina: IT'S BEAUTIFUL. PLEASE, SIT! YOU MUST EAT. YOU'VE HAD A LONG JOURNEY, AND YOU NEED NOURISHMENT. AND OF COURSE YOU MUST BE THIRSTY. BLBLBLBAAAH! HA HA HA HA HA! BON APPETIT. OH, YEAH! [CHOMPING, SLURPING] UM, AREN'T WE WAITING FOR THE REST OF YOUR COMPANY? OH, NO. THOSE ARE SET OUT FOR MY FRIENDS. THE FRIENDS I HAVEN'T MET YET. HUH? [CHITTERING] YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE THE RAINBOW IN YOUR EYES. THAT'S A SIGN YOU ARE DESTINED FOR GREAT THINGS. YEAH, RIGHT. I'M DIFFERENT, THAT'S ALL. NOT GREAT. YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED. [BIBBLE SNORING] BLBLBLBLBLBL. HEH HEH HEH HEH. BLBLBLBLBLBL. YOU MUST BE TIRED, TOO. COME, LET ME GIVE YOU A PLACE TO SLEEP. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MAGIC MEADOW? CAN YOU HELP? I THINK I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT, ELINA? I WAS THINKING ABOUT MY FLOWER. PEONY. THE MAGIC MEADOW ISN'T THE ONLY PLACE WITH PROBLEMS. ALL OF FAIRYTOPIA IS IN DANGER, AND I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE OF LAVERNA. I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE WAS A MYTH. OH, NO, SHE'S REAL. AND AS CALLOUS AND SELFISH AS OUR ENCHANTRESS IS LOVING. THAT'S WHY I'M LEAVING IN THE MORNING. I NEED TO SPEAK WITH A DRYAD NAMED DAHLIA, WHO LIVES IN THE WILDERING WOOD. SHE USED TO FOLLOW LAVERNA AND MIGHT KNOW HOW TO STOP HER. ELINA, MAY I ASK YOU A FAVOR? ANYTHING. I WANT YOU TO HOLD SOMETHING FOR ME. YOUR NECKLACE. OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I CAN'T TAKE THIS. IT'S JUST FOR NOW. MY TRIP TO DAHLIA WILL BE QUITE DANGEROUS, AND I WANT MY NECKLACE TO STAY SAFE. BUT, AZURA, IF IT'S SO DANGEROUS, WHY ARE YOU GOING? ISN'T THERE ANOTHER WAY? NOT IF I WANT TO KEEP MY FRIENDS FROM HARM. IT'S A SACRIFICE I'M WILLING TO MAKE FOR THEM. FOR THE FRIENDS YOU HAVEN'T MET. AND FOR THE ONES I HAVE. NOW GET SOME REST. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING BEFORE I TAKE MY TRIP... PERHAPS. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SNORING, CHITTERING] [CHITTERING] BIBBLE. [CHITTERING] ♪ BIBBLE ♪ AAH! HEY! HEH HEH HEH HEH! OHH! HEY. OHH!

IT--IT FEELS LIKE WE'VE BEEN TRAVELING FOREVER, AND-- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT AZURA TOLD YOU ABOUT ME, BUT I CAN'T HELP YOU. OH, BUT YOU CAN! AZURA SAID SO. SHE SAID YOU WERE LOYAL TO LAVERNA ONCE, SO YOU'LL KNOW HOW TO HELP STOP HER. HEH, THAT'S WHAT I SAID 10 YEARS AGO, WHEN I REALIZED LAVERNA WAS EVIL AND LEFT HER SERVICE. I TRIED TO TALK TO THE GUARDIANS AND TELL THEM I'D HELP, BUT ONLY AZURA BELIEVED I'D CHANGED. THE REST THOUGHT I WAS A SPY. SO NO, I'M NOT REALLY EXCITED ABOUT DOING ANY FAVORS FOR THE GUARDIANS. THANKS FOR DROPPING BY, BUT GET LOST. NO! AZURA WAS YOUR FRIEND. SHE STUCK UP FOR YOU, AND SHE'S IN TROUBLE. ALL OF FAIRYTOPIA'S IN TROUBLE. DOESN'T THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? I DON'T KNOW ALL OF FAIRYTOPIA, SO WHY WOULD I RISK MY NECK FOR THEM? THEY'RE THE FRIENDS YOU HAVEN'T MET YET. EXCUSE ME? THAT'S WHAT AZURA WOULD SAY. SHE MEANS YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT, EVEN IF IT'S NOT THE EASIEST THING FOR YOU. I GUESS SHE THOUGHT YOU KNEW THAT. I'M SORRY I BOTHERED YOU. WAIT! MAYBE I CAN HELP. Bibble: ELINA-POO!

HOW DID IT WORK? I'M NOT SURE, EXACTLY. SHE WAS STILL PLANNING IT WHEN I LEFT. BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS CLEAR ABOUT ITS WEAKNESS. IT PLAGUED HER THAT IT WOULDN'T BE PERFECT. SHE SAID THE UNION POINT WOULD ALWAYS BE FRAGILE. THE UNION POINT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I DON'T KNOW. I CAN ONLY HOPE WE'LL KNOW WHEN WE SEE IT. THERE! THAT'S LAVERNA'S LAIR. LAND BEHIND THAT BOULDER. [SCREECHING] THE ENTRANCE IS RIGHT THERE, BUT IT'S NOT SAFE IN THE AIR ANYMORE. THEY'D SPOT US IMMEDIATELY. [SCREECHING] THAT'S OK. HUE SHOULDN'T FLY ANYWAY.
