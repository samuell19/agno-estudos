DEDICATED TO THE SPIRIT OF DIRECTOR ≡ITO DAISUKE≡ Wait? We can't wait any longer. It has been two and a half years since we left the Choshu domain and arrived here in Kyoto. If we just sit around and do nothing, that would let those Satsuma men have everything their own way. I just heard that this man named Sakamoto Ryoma from Tosa, is scheming something by acting as a go-between between the Satsuma and the big shots of our clan. I'll kill him. I will kill that man. We are not letting those Satsuma bumpkins and Tosa punks ruin all our efforts. That's right. So... Katsura-san... If we act carelessly without a clear understanding of the general situation, that would only benefit those dogs of the central government. Damn it! Are they Mimawarigumi or Shinsengumi? Genbajiro and I will guard Katsura-san. All plans will stay as they are. We will cut our way through the enemy. Let's go! Follow them! LOVE'S TWISTING PATH (Tajuro Junaiki) It is no good? It is no good again? Well, I am not saying that you are a poor painter. In the first place, the design for painted silk of Yuzen should... One must feel that the design should be used for kimono... That's right! Who are wearing this design? Women. If you knew it, why couldn't you make something more elegant? Why summer oranges? For us low wage samurai, that is an irreplaceable source of income. Huh? Summer oranges? For samurai? He is here! Just as I thought! Mister, why are you wasting time with that fag? Hey, who are you calling a fag? Idiot! Who are you calling an idiot? Mister! You have a visitor. For me? "I will wait for him inside." He said with too much self-pride. And he went inside. No, he let them in because he wanted some tips from them. Hey! I finally found you, Tajuro. Come on. Thanks. Yes. Thank you! He is a suspicious character. I don't know what would happen. I wonder if he is avenging his parents. What are you doing at the entrance of someone's residence? Mister Tajuro is having a visitor. A visitor? Is it a woman? It is a lowly samurai with a scary face. You are talking too loudly. Ah, it is just a samurai. Two new girls are starting to work at the bar tonight. So why don't you come over? We'll go. Yes, we can. I am begging you. Please! To protect Katsura-san, we need your skill that is known as the best in the Choshu domain. But... Did you forget about what happened two and a half years ago? We were determined to carry out the objective of "Revere the Emperor and Expel the Barbarians" and left the domain to come to Kyoto. We pledged to defeat the central government and take over the country together. Taking the country? Leaving the domain? I did not leave the domain with you men for taking over the country. What? It is truly embarrassing to say, but I could not manage all the debt that has accumulated since my parents' generation. I could not even feed myself. Right at that time, you were about to leave the domain. I was too poor to have a wife and I only have a younger brother born of a different mother. So it was convenient to leave the domain and annul debts for decency's sake. That is just a prop to earn a living. This is ridiculous! We don't need to ask for this man's help. I will protect Katsura-san! Tajuro, I understood everything and I'm still asking you for your help. We need your skill! I am begging you! How much are you paying? You are talking about taking over the country. You must have lots of money. Bastard! Get out! Come with me! I will teach you a lesson! Come on! This is not a good place for it. Don't worry. How far are you going? Here I come. Here I come! Draw your sword. You coward! Eijanaika! Eijanaika! Eijanaika! "Eijinaika! Eijinaika!" (That is great! That is great! Social reform is great!) 'Tenchu' (Divine punishment)! That is enough. Withdraw! That's like Tajuro... Please! Please help us with that skill. I am done talking about that. We will come again...!! "Eijinaika! Eijinaika!" (That is great! That is great! Social reform is great!) Otoyo! Otoyo! Those two new girls have been there all this time. What is going on? Please be patient. It's a bummer! Thank you. Please come this way. Ah! You ruined boss's clothes! Hey, Otoyo! How are you going to settle this? I am sorry for the blunder. We will pay for the cleaning. Please forgive us. You two apologize! This is very precious clothing given by the leader of the Mimawarigumi. Precious clothing should not have been worn to be in this dirty bar. Besides, we had refused to let these new girls serve you since today is the first day for them. But the boss insisted... What are you saying? Hey, don't be so tough. No, we can't. We can never do such a silly thing. What? These girls are not prostitutes. They just started to work here today. If you insist, you need to pay money at some brothel. It is petty for you to take girls for free by abusing government authority. What did you say? You bitch! Please stop! Who are you? Bastard! Are you being defiant against the government? - What is the government? - You are just perverts! Don't forget about this! When was the last time you cleaned? Hey, get up! Get up! Get up! It stinks! Wash your face with this. The landlord will be coming. Today is the day we pay the rent. - Okiku, he is here. - All right. Good morning. Hello, Mr. landlord. Thank you for your hard work. One, two, three... I certainly received it. We are in a troubled time because of the conflict between the emperor supporters and shogun supporters. But I am grateful that my tenants pay punctually every month. We are thankful that we are sheltered from the weather because of you. We would make sure to pay even if we have to bottow some... Borrow? No! No, my husband makes good money. One, two, three... Yes. The interest is the same as usual. Yes. Yes. You did not make payments for last month and the month before that. Well, things are tight now. No one can be extravagant like old days. I will tell my husband and make sure we will pay next month. Well, so long. What is that? This is a man's? Yes. Loincloth. Loincloth? It doesn't belong to that ronin, does it? Yes, it does. No! That's no good! Mother... No, not that poor man. You should never! Stop it, mother. Who would take a man like him? I am just washing his clothing because it stinks so bad. I have had enough with poor men. Well, after you are done with that, would you come with me to go to Dr. Gensai's place? My eye is bad again. You can go there by yourself. Well, when you come with me, that doctor charges me so much less. Huh? KANBEI'S TENEMENT HOUSED I need to ask you something so I want you to come to the police station. Yes, but why do you need to ask me? Shut up and come with me! So that ronin is a bodyguard hired by that bar? Yes. The hag with heavy make-up found him somewhere. Who is that hag with heavy make-up? You don't know her? That woman named Omitsu puts heavy make-up on even though she is very old. Although when she was a geisha at the Kamishichiken, she used to be a sexy girl. A rich man took her in but she was widowed and kicked out of the house. That place is Omitsu's bar. Mother, shall we go? Yes, yes. The girl named Otoyo who is responsible for running the bar was adopted from the Takao area. Omitsu was raising her to make her work as a geisha at the Kamishichiken in the future. But at the time she was ready to work, she fell in love with a man and eloped. But after a while, she escaped from him since he was going to sell her off. Damaged goods like her can't be good merchandise. So she works at the bar instead. Neither of them has good luck with men. Oh, it is Kanbei-san! I am sorry that I had to make you come. Please sit. I need to ask you something about your tenant. Yes, whatever... Good. I need to know about the ronin who lives in your tenement house. Well, nowadays, all bumpkin samurai are moving into Kyoto for supporting the emperor or shogun. And you know those men are acting in a disorderly manner? Yes, I know... Especially, the government is keeping an eye out for those men from Choshu and Satsuma. So we need to arrest them as soon as we find them these days. And if you give them shelter... - They are killing ronin! Killing ronin! Wait! Mister! Mister, where have you been? That samurai came back just a little while ago. He asked us to give you this. - Sanzaemon did? - Yes. "We got the money you wanted even though it is not much. "We will wait for you at the Kamiya shrine at about eight o'clock tonight. "By the way, we heard that your younger brother, Kazuma will soon arrive in Kyoto." Is that right? So you are going with us? It won't matter where I may be... My stepmother is Kazuma's natural mother. It is best for her to live with Kazuma since my father has died. Brother, I will be following you soon. No. Why not? You must be dutiful to your mother. Now the country is more important than my mother. I want to see it! I want to see the world, too! More saké... It won't matter to us as long as you pay money, even if you die by the roadside. Mister, how about very high quality soft-shelled turtle? Bring whatever. Bring it over. Yes. Hey, drinking saké is fine, but how about this? We have women with amazing bodies. You can have the soft-shelled turtle delivered there. Well, let's go now! Hey! Old man! Yes. Give everyone saké with this! Bring them! Tonight we rule the country. Thank you. Let's start drinking again! "Eijinaika! Eijinaika!" (That is great! That is great! Social reform is great!) This coloring skill... Is he just an idiot or a genius? Thank you. Thanks. Choshu ronin, Ito Sanzaemon, be prepared to die! Are you Shinsengumi? Withdraw! Don't chase them! Ito-same, I, Kazuma, was waiting for your return. Let's go inside. This place is not good anymore. Shinsengumi knows about it now. Ito-same! What should I do? What should I do? Ito-same, Ito-same... Your brother just got lost and could not find me. You two... must work together... for the country. Why is that? Why do you care about me? - I don't know why. - Why? You really don't know? I am asking because I don't know. You blockhead! I am indeed a blockhead and good-for-nothing. I left home because I could not make a living. And I shut myself from the world. And finally I abandoned Sanzaemon. Why am I here? Why am I still living? Why? You just got drunk with bad saké. You just need to sleep. One night of good sleep would... Stop caring about me! Why do you care about a man like me? I am that kind of woman. Tajuro... you should forget about everything that you don't like. I don't mind going to hell, as long as I am with you. Tajuro... Why? I am a worthless bastard. You should die! If your life is so worthless. You should die! Now! You are... I gave up being a samurai a long time ago. KYOTO MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE What? He is a ronin who left the Choshu domain? Yes. Do you have concrete evidence? You are quite right to be suspicious. I have some witnesses. Why wouldn't the local magistrate's office arrest him? Well... He is a very skilled man. We would not be able to handle him. And where are the witnesses? I asked the jail guards to keep them at that place. Terawaki, pick some skilled men. So... The Shinsengumi just took credit for something they did yesterday. We will show them what we are capable of. - I will report it to the chief immediately. - Wait. It is just a punk ronin. We can report to the chief afterward. Yes. I need to ask you a question. I am busy now. I have heard that there is a tenement house called Kanbei Nagaya around here. Do you happen to know where it is? Thanks. Huh! There are so many of those annoying men these days. Those bumpkin-samurai from Choshu... Hey, wait. Madam! Give me the money. Thanks. Why did you abandon Ito-same and let him die? Brother, which side are you on, emperor supporter or... Kazuma... Answer me! Which side? Whichever you take, what would not... Did you see with your own eyes? Huh? See the world clearly with your own eyes! I have seen it. Ronin from the Choshu domain, Kiyokawa Tajuro. We are here to arrest you. Listen, you must really pay attention to what I tell you now. Kiyokawa Tajuro! We are here to arrest you. Terawaki... Break in! Wait! Wait! Bastard! Draw. Draw your sword! Wait! Kazuma! Brother... Listen, this has nothing to do with you. You punk! Kazuma! Go to Gensai's place. I will be there for sure. Yes. Terawaki was killed? I am sorry. That special unit is the elite unit for their great fencing skill even among the Mimawarigumi. But he still managed to defeat four men from the unit. You are sure that the man named Kiyokawa is close to Katsura Kogoro? Yes, sir. Both he and his younger brother are. Chief, we must save face. I would like to avenge those who were killed. Mobilize the entire force and find those men. And contact the magistrate's office immediately, and blockade the northern area first. You must seal the area off completely. Yes, sir! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. KYOTO MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE - Go! - Yes, sir! This is the place. Search everywhere, including above the ceiling! Yes, sir! Hurry! This is a serious matter! What's going to happen to us? Tajuro and that young man have no way to escape. What would happen to them if they get caught? Their heads will be cut off and would be displayed at the Sanjogahara field. That's too awful! By the way, where is Gonzo? He came home late last night looking pale. He has stayed in his room since then. Hey! Dear! That's enough! You have been drinking too much! Shut up! I haven't done anything wrong! Dear! Come on! What's the matter? Hey! Hey! Pull yourself together! Hey! What's the matter? Hurry! Go! - Who? - Ah! Omitsu! Otoyo! Have you seen Otoyo? Otoyo is not around anymore! It seems tense on the street. What is happening? Otoyo! Where is Otoyo? Doctor... Doctor, how are my eyes? You should think that you're lucky that you survived. Pull yourself together, Kazuma-san. Your older brother will be here soon. Otoyo, I treated him because of your urgent request. But this is all I can do. If you associate with these kind of men, you will repeat the same old mistake. You may ruin your life. Tajuro! Please escape with Kazuma. I can't let him die because of my problem. Please! Otoyo, you are the only one whom I can rely on. At dawn, I will try to buy some time. Go somewhere far away while I am at it. Please promise me that you will join later. My destination is Takao. That's where I am originally from. Promise me that you will join me there for sure. For sure... Excuse me. Kazuma... Kill me! Kill me, brother! Kill me! Kill me! Kazuma, calm down! You will escape from here. Otoyo will take you. Please kill me. I cannot help the emperor to expel the barbarians with eyes like these. I would only be an encumbrance. So I'd rather have you end my life. Listen! You wanted to see the world. You must survive! Survive! Survive! To see this world. You must do that for me too. Brother... I will let you escape for sure. And you must live! This is an order. Never separate from Otoyo. Got it? Otoyo! Thank you for your hard work. Please have some? Please have some. - Everything all right? - Yes, yes. According to the record, the man named Kiyokawa Tajuro is a low-ranking vassal, but was a notoriously skilled fencer in the Choshu domain. Even if he is a skilled fencer... Listen, I must be clear about this. You must make sure that you would never make a sacrifice of townspeople or innocent people under any circumstances. Yes. Come this way! Come on! Come this way! Open! Open quickly! Open! Open! Anyone here? Anyone here? Anyone here? Go that way. Search everywhere! - Go! - Yes! He is here! Wait! That direction! This way! - Keep moving! - Yes! That way! Wait! If he is telling the truth, Kiyokawa's younger brother is running away with this woman named Otoyo. I am never telling you a lie. A blind man and a woman. They must not have gone too far. Where is that woman originally from? She is from Takao, officer. Takao... It is about 5 miles from here. Just to be sure, send a pursuing party. You take the command in person. Yes, sir. We must arrest him in order to save the honor of the magistrate's office. Yes, sir! The magistrate's office must do this at any cost. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Bastard! Wait! Pull yourself together. Don't stop! Follow him! I found him. Don't move! If you get any closer, this priest and woman will be dead. Sorry. It is for just a little while. I will never allow you to hurt this woman. I am sorry. We are almost there. Otoyo-san... Stay there. I am wetting the towel in the river. Otoyo-san. Otoyo-san! Otoyo-san... Otoyo-san! Otoyo-san! Otoyo-san... - From here, there is only one way to get to Takao. - Hurry! - Yes. Otoyo-san. Otoyo-san. ♪The little Buddha inside...♪ ♪Why is it so short?♪ ♪The little Buddha inside...♪ ♪Why is it so short?♪ Hey, clear the way. Chief! He took a priest and his wife as hostages.
