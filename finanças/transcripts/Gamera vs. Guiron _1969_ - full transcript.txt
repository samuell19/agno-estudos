DAIEI MOTION PICTURE CO., LTD. There are 100 billion stars in the galaxy. There are also 3 billion nebulae in the macrocosm. Each is as big as galaxy. Old stars explode and scatter as gas. New stars are formed from the gas. What secrets are hidden in these countless stars? A star is in trouble. GAMERA VS.

Irregular waves that might've been sent from outer space. MYSTERIOUS WAVES FROM OUTER SPACE The waves have stopped. We don't know yet if they're messages from aliens. Dr. Shiga, the same electric waves were caught in England last year too. That was different. From beyond the solar system, we think. This one's very much nearer. People are on other planets in the solar system? That's hard to say. You... There's no air or water on the moon. So no living thing inhabits it, as you know. And there are no rivers on Mars. It's several hundred degrees Celcius, on Venus. And the surface of Jupiter is covered with frozen ammonia. Saturn is the same. No advanced vertebrates there. What do the waves mean? Assuming they came from Proxima Centauri which is nearest us... How long would it take Apollo, the newest spaceship, to get there? 500,000 years. Even if we did receive an invitation from aliens... We wouldn't be able to meet them unless they came to us. It's only a dream still. MESSAGE FROM ALIENS? Are there aliens? Sure. Or those waves wouldn't have come. Tom! I see something weird! Look! What is it? What is it? A Spaceship! It's true! It's cool! Let me look too! No, me! Let me look! A spaceship. I can't see it! It came down! Let's go see! Yes! Take me too! The vacant lot where we play. Akio! Akio! Mother. She'll scold us again. We're in trouble! I thought you were studying. Looking at stars? We saw a spaceship! You imagined it. Don't stay up late! You too, Tom, if you want to stay. We watch the stars every night to... I know. You want to find new stars and name them Akio and Tom Stars? That's not all! The paper said waves were sent. Systematically, too. Spacemen, maybe. Trying to find the star. They may be very civilized there. With no wars or traffic accidents. There's no such star. Behave, or I'll take away your telescope. Grownups have no dreams. No more foolishness. Go to bed. Tomorrow. What? A spaceman? Someone worse. Leave it to me. Where? It's them again! Here! Wait! Stop! What's this? You come back too. Good morning, Kon. Don't call him Kon! Say, Officer. It's all right. My name's Kondo. Two kids shouldn't ride a bike at once. I'm sorry. We're in a hurry. In a hurry so early? You're up to something again? No! We're going to find a spaceship. Don't joke. We saw it! It's true! It came down. I see, I see, I see! If you're naughty again, I'll shave your heads. You Okay? Take this. Off with you but walk. Walk. After this hill? Let's climb from here. Wait for me! Hurry! Where? Over here! A spaceman? What the? It's just a rabbit? How cute! Let's catch it. You dummy! You can't. Let's Go. Brother! Brother! What is it? We were right! A spaceship! Yeah! Let's take look! It's so cool! Are spacemen on it? Inside, maybe. Let's go inside. No! I'm scared of aliens! Moron! They flew here. They're civilized! You're dumb. - Excuse me! - Hello! Think they'll understand Japanese? You're the dumb ones! What? The crew's out? They must be away. This is so cool! It's working! Imagine traveling in this! That'd be awesome! Now, the countdown. Standby for takeoff. Standing DY! Let's go! 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0! Brother! Brother! It's moving! This is so crazy! Stop it! Where are you going, Brother? Mother will be sooo mad! Naughty! Naughty! What'll I tell her? It won't stop! Not till the fuel runs out. You fooled around with the switches! But you ordered me to! We're in space already! How weird! We're not weightless. Gravity still works in here. It's a superior spaceship. What's that? Meteors! It'll hit us! It's terrible! Change course! No, I can't! We'll get hit! It's Gamera! Good for you! Help us, Gamera! Good! Awesome! Thanks, Gamera! A race with Gamera! I'm not scared now! No, Gamera's our friend! Awfully fast. Mach 3? No! It's outer space speed! Apollo, the moon rocket, was Mach 33. Am I surprised! We'd leave the solar system at Mach 50. Gamera, Gamera... You're so very strong, Gamera, Gamera. Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus... Is it Mars or is it Venus? Come on, space monsters, It cuts, it pokes, go-go-go, It has mighty jet propulsion. Gamera's strong, Gamera, Gamera. What happened? What's the matter? Gamera! Maybe he's trying to stop us! He's not coming. Why? Look! The speedometer! Getting faster! It's going even faster. Remote control? Gamera's jets. Keep it up! No! What'll we do? This ship's being made to go fast. Gamera! Gamera! Help us! Mother! Mother! My, my, such a loud voice. Where were you? It's awful! Akio teased you? No! They went away on a spaceship! You're as silly as they are. It's true! We found a spaceship! They went in it. Then it lit up! I see. Akio's up to something again? Mother, don't you believe in spaceships and spacemen? No, I don't. But the papers said a lot of people have been seeing flying saucers lately! Made up stories. But! Stop it. Study or you'll never get into a good school. I'm in trouble! How can I make her understand? Poor boys. I wonder where they are now. Say, Tom, we've landed somewhere! We're safe! Not hurt? I'm okay! The hatch is open! There's air here. We don't need space suits. Are we back on Earth? Let's go out and see! Where are we? Not Earth. Is it Mars? Or Venus? No, they don't have any air. The air saved us. There are stars like Earth. We've found a new star. We're the first ones here, huh? Wait. We were brought by remote control. Be careful. Oh, no! Help us! It's Gyaos! There's one here too? But he's a different color! A Space Gyaos? Awe crap! What'll we do? The water's running backwards. It's running away. No! Attacking from behind! It doesn't move. It's flying low! It's meeeean! Is it too smelly to eat? It's returning to its hole. Where'd it come from? The opposite switch. Let's jump! The water's coming back! What's going on? I bet we're on a highly civilized star. Teleporting is very handy! Let's check this place out! It's awesome! That sound? Somebody's here, I bet. Anybody around? Please answer! You dummy! Why would they understand Japanese?! They're spacemen. What if goblins come out? Don't worry! Akio! Help me! Jump off! What're you afraid of? A moving sidewalk? I see. Let's try it. It's so cool! The control center. Where are we? Who are you? They don't understand what we're saying. We've been waiting for you. You can speak Japanese? This speaking machine translates all languages. Oh, wow! Science has advanced here more than on Earth. Which star is this? How far are we from the Earth? We call it Tera. It's on the opposite side of the Earth. It's exactly like the Earth with the sun between it. Twin stars then? Is it true? On the other side of the sun means they'd never see each other. This is major! Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. That's nine planets. Tera's the tenth? Yes. Gyaos again. A nuisance. Barbella, let it out. Your name's Barbella? It means sweet as a little bird. I'm Flobella. My name means "pretty as a posey." The others? The same as before. Running backwards. It's against the law of gravity. We control the laws of nature here. Superior civilization! I looked in my telescope everyday. I thought there'd be an ideal planet without wars and traffic accidents. That monster. Guiron's our watchdog. We can control it. Gyaos is running! Why are there monsters in such a civilized place? Ours was an advanced society. We could control the laws of nature with electronic brains. But a mix-up in the computer brought mass destruction. It caused uncontrollable monsters to form. We sent out messages for help but received no answers. I see. The waves Dr. Shiga talked about. Those who survived got on a big spaceship to find another star but it fell. So we're the only two left. We found a small ship, so we called it back. You were on it. I see. We can only live here on this space base now. Look. It's getting colder. We'll be bound in by glaciers in 5 hours. Barbella. This used to be a city long ago. But it's home to these monsters now. Let's go back to Earth. If we don't... Thanks. We'll check the ship and go before it freezes over. Aren't we lucky? If only Gamera were here! Gamera's looking for us. Gamera? This is the control center's lobby Rest here while we repair the ship. The ship only holds two, so those boys... I know. We've time yet. I'll see if they're poisonous or not. If not, they'll become our rations. You check the ship. I'm hungry. Can we go home? Don't worry! The girls said we'd go as soon as the ship's repaired! Yes. Won't everyone be surprised to see such cool space girls? Akio... What's the matter? How weird. Now, my son answer these questions. Yes, ma'am. What would you like the most now? Don't be shy. What's the matter? Answer me. I see. We'll make that right away. Okay keep answering me until the food's ready. In pain? No, it feels nice. What's the matter, Akio? What's the matter, Akio? What a pest! You knew Gyaos. Are there many monsters on Earth? Not now. Gamera took care of them all. What is Gamera? Looking for you, you said. Try to remember. Gamera's the friend of children. He appears when we need him. He saved a child in Hokkaido once. He knocked Gyaos out when Gyaos tried to eat the child. He saved two boys, too, when Viras attacked the earth. How weird. You just froze up, man. It felt like I ate a lot of my Mother's doughnuts. Her doughnuts are good. Say, I'm so hungry. I'm starving! I'm thirsty. - How is the ship? - We can leave at once. Good! Prepare all the food on this card. Use sleeping powder. While they're sleeping, we'll eat their brains raw. All of the knowledge that's been handed down to them is stored up there. We can adapt ourselves to our new surroundings then. That's how bacteria here evolves to a higher species. I see. I came for Tom. Elza. Thanks for keeping him. Not at all. He and Akio haven't returned yet. Where did they go? Does Tomoko know? No. There's no use asking her. They've told her not to tell. She speaks only of outer space. Tom wants to stay with us longer He must have run away, knowing you were coming. I'm sure he did. He can stay. I see. If you'd be so kind then. Please stay for tea. I'm in a hurry, so... I see. Take care. Auntie. Why, Tomoko! They really went away on a spaceship! Tell me all about it. Kon! Kon! It's awful! - Hurry! - What's wrong? They just left them here. Here! The spaceship was right here! There was an announcement by the American Aerospace Bureau. Those saucers were all just figments of someone's imagination. No, it's true! I saw it with my own two eyes! But the Apollo astronauts said Earth is the only oasis in space. There are no living things elsewhere. But the boys went on a spaceship! You believe me, don't you? Yes, I'll believe you. You're a good girl. You wouldn't lie. I'll find your brother for you. I'm so happy. Don't worry. I give up. The observatory. Thanks, Kon. Taking a child's word and asking the folks at the observatory? But... No buts about it. There's no such thing as an alien! The boys must be playing near here somewhere. Please find them. Of course, I will. Do you read me? Pretending to believe them is bad from an educational standpoint. But Tomoko's serious about it, so... No! Brother! Ken's Going to find you, so don't give up! Please, God, save the boys. Akio. Here you are. Hungry, aren't you? My favorite, doughnuts! Looks good! Just like mother's doughnuts. Please eat them. Thanks! Wait. What is it? Be still! I thought Gamera came. I don't hear him! Maybe I imagined it? Hurry, let's eat. I'll give you half. “'8 good! I feel weird. Akio, what's the matter? Buck up! The sleeping powder's activating. Hurry. Cut here. Then remove the skull. It's Gamera! A child's friend? Here for them? The nuisance. Let's take care of it first. Have the monsters fight. Let Guiron out. He's dead. Just what he deserves. Akio! Akio! What happened? Big Sister! We must cook them or... Wait. How odd. Gamera's mixed everything up. It's the only one left. If it's no good? Let's eat the boys later. The spaceship first. It's baaaad! Akio! Akio! Akio! It hurts! My hair! There's no time for that! They're cannibals! They're not fixing the ship for us but to go find people to eat! Let's get out of here! But my head! Wear this. Tom! Wait a minute! Those boys? Running away. They know. Oh, no you don't! You can't get away that easy! Damn! We're right back where we started! Run! You're smart. I pushed the reverse button. Look. Yeees! They're gone. Break the handle, so they can't come back! They can't come back now! Serves them right! Goodbye forever! Too bad. How'd you get back? You couldn't come back! No, but we made a round trip. Crap! Let's run for it! Don't move! Let go! We're not good to eat! Get on it! Hands above your heads, back to back! Switch! We're not monkeys! Hurry. The ship! Where did they go? Even the policeman's worried. Tom's getting 30 lashes for bad behavior as soon as I find him. I'm very sorry. I hope they return... Tomoko, will you tell us about the spaceship? Will you? Who are you? Akio's mother? We heard that a space ship landed in these parts. The policeman reported it, so we came to check on it. It's true? Tell us, Tomoko. Where did the spaceship go? We don't know. People say it flew very fast. We only know about the mysterious waves. What did it look like, Tomoko? What'll we do? Can't we go home? I miss my mom! Buck up. We have to find a way to escape! I wish Gamera would come. Why won't he come? Be quiet! Gamera! Gamera! Gamera! That's right! You've a pistol? Yes. Aim for the switch. I see! Okay! I missed! No good. How many more shots? Three more. Trust me. It's funny! Guiron's remote control switch! Cut it off! What'll we do? Fixed at last! It's Guiron! We can't control it from here! Let's escape to Earth! Those boys? Leave them. There are lots of others on Earth. Hurry! We can't go to Earth now! Wait! What is it? It hurts! I can't move! Help me! Flobella! On our planet, useless members die. Guiron's almost here! It's the end! We'll be killed! Help! Help! - Help! - Help! It's Gamera! Help us, Gamera! You can't lose! Go for it, Gamera! Don't lose, Gamera! You all right? I'm okay. It's Gamera! Get him, Gamera! Don't lose out! Don't miss! Good! Nice jump! He did it! His jets don't work from the front! Banzai! Good one, Gamera! Perfect! He's doing the Go-Go! No! He's trying to get rid of those! He can't retract his feet with them there! They're blocking his jets? Guiron's coming this way! Hurry! The remote control switch! I can't find it! Don't worry about it! Just push! Hurry! Hurry! We'll get killed! It's over? Even he can't do it. It makes me mad! If we had a weapon! Wishful thinking's no good. Wait! Wait! I'm amazed. Gamera's still alive. Well I'm down to the last resort! I'll get him! Ouch! What's that? The weapon you asked for? A missile! It's the switch. Here comes Gamera! Good job, Gamera! Now! The missile! Gamera, aim for the hole! Get it! Nice shot! Gamera's calling us! It's repairing the spaceship! He's waiting. What a big palm! - You said it! - How cooool! Let's go. It's moving! Hooray! We can go home! We're so lucky! Gamera, Gamera... You're so very strong, Gamera, Gamera. Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus... Is it Mars or is it Venus? Come on, space monsters, It cuts, it pokes, go-go-go, It has mighty jet propulsion. Gamera's strong, Gamera, Gamera. What's the matter? It's Gamera! I'll report it! So noisy, I made a mistake! Hello. Yes, it is. That's ridiculous. I don't believe you. Professor I see Gamera in our telescope. The spaceship's in his mouth. Hard to believe. The boys were taken from here. Can it be true? Yes, it is! I hope it's true. Please believe her, men. Gamera's a friend of children. - Kon. - What is it little one? Thanks. Don't worry about it. This is the place? Just over the mountain. Thank you. Are you the boys' mothers? Yes, we are. I'm so surprised by all this. Gamera's heading this way, it seems, with a spaceship. - Reeeeeally? - And our children? Check it out! It's Gamera! It is! - Watch out! - Tomoko! Brother! We should have believed our children, huh? Yep. It would seem so. Tomoko. All right? We were worried. I'm okay! Your glasses. It's all right. When I'm happy, they slide down. Gamera! - Morn! - We're back! I'm glad you're safe! But you worried everybody. Mother, folks we're awfully sorry. Akio, shaving your head in atonement, eh? No, spacewomen did it. Oh, surrrre. Yeah right! Listen, Kon, there are space people like you too? Akio. Tom. Dr. Shiga. We discovered a planet and saw space people. We thought there'd be a highly civilized, peaceful planet. But Earth's way the better. We shouldn't long for other planets. But make Earth a place free of wars and traffic accidents. So you learned a lot from your travels. He retracted his head. Gamera! Thanks! Gamera! Sayonara! Thanks, Gamera! Sayonara, Gamera! THE END
