Let the show begin. Sir, show will begin. Please, don't create any problem. He is Basavaraj. Usually, he doesn't come out in public. But if he comes out, it's troubles. His brother is Ramaraj, a local MP. If elder brother is the brain, he is the brawn. Basava, I'm going to Delhi. Meet the police officer. Tell this to children. They might get scared. Not me. You're dead meat. After hitting me in my own city today, do you think you will survive? Shall I hit you tomorrow? Or day after tomorrow? Or the day after that? If you misbehave with women, I will hit you anywhere and anytime. Who are they? I've been telling you not to speak in Kannada with me. I don't understand. Speak in Telugu. Who are they? - I don't know. What? - How will I know them? I'm talking about these guys. These are the guys whom Dr. Surekha told us about. Did you explain our rules? - No, I did not. Why? - You never told me, did you? Did you have you breakfast? - Yes, I did. Did I tell you to have breakfast? I really like you. You pay my salary on the first of every month. And you slap me whenever I go wrong. Understood? Somewhat... Follow me. - Okay sir. Yadamma... Just a small piece of paper. Be it small or big, it has to be cleaned. Understood? - Yes, sir. Clean the lift too. Yadamma, clean the lift. - Yes, I did. You cleaned it when it was in the first floor. Be it first floor or second floor, the lift is the same. Understood? - Yes sir. Is he carrying water or pouring on floor? He is carrying by pouring. - Why? It was your fault. When he complained to you of taps dry in his flat, you did not care. Look at me. His problem is mine too. Ask him to use my bathroom. - Okay. But not now. Only after the bucket is empty. Surekha did chose a good flat for us. You are... I'm Bunty, owner of this Clean and Green Apartments. Married? - How would I know? I'm talking about you and not me. Not yet. He said he's a bachelor. Bachelor means unmarried. Really? I don't know Kannada. That's why you didn't understand. - Yes sir. In this city, our flats are the best. 24 hours power and water supply... Won't be available? Families live here. Make sure your stay doesn't disturb others. We will make sure we're never seen. If that is so, collecting rent would be a problem to me. Your stay shouldn't trouble anyone. Got it? - What? Understood? I really scared the hell out of him. What is this? Thanks sir. You helped me unload. - What load? Will you stand behind me? What are they doing here? Since water taps have gone dry their bathrooms... You told them to use mine, right? - Yes. Uncle... - What? Will you give me some water? - What for? I couldn't control it. So, I made your kitchen my toilet. Kitchen...? You need a bucket of water not a jug of water. What's that noise? - Washing machine, sir. Is anyone turning it into a toilet? Stop... What do you call this? - My brief. But why there are so many holes? Because I need good air circulation. Then why wear it? Be free. - I can't be like you. I told him about it. Now do you know what to say and what not to say? - Yes sir. Uncle... - Why did you come again? It's getting dry. Wash it. Lift him up. Who is that? Stop Vasu. I want to talk to you. Neither I wished to see you nor talk to you in my life. Like every story has an end, our story too has one. Our story ended long back. If you try to reopen it, you will find only blank pages. I will go out from your house but not from your heart. Our story ended long back. Neither I wished to see you nor talk to you in my life. Hey Anjali, where is your daddy? We are getting late to the flight. - Even I'm looking for him. He has all our passports. And we are getting late to the flight. What okay? - Actually... He run into you wantonly. She is trying to be smart. Forget it. What to forget? We shouldn't spare such men. When you see girls, you try to ogle or run into them. Rogues...! Will you apologize? Why did I run into her instead of running into you? Will you dash against me? C'mon... dash against me if you can. How dare you dash against me? Men try to dash against us even if we stop them. Now that you challenged him, how will he miss the chance? The real culprit is you. - What happened? Nothing. They were getting late to board the flight. I was coming from there. They were coming from here. The announcements were blaring and we are were tensed. We didn't see each other. I dashed that girl like this. The girl I dashed is fine. But she is getting very emotional. What happened? - Nothing. I was coming from there. That girl was coming from here. It was getting late. I was tensed. I dashed that girl like this. How could it be my fault? He is re-playing the scene again and again. What's the problem? Matter is settled. You shut up. What happened? - Nothing. I was coming from there. They were coming from here. And I dashed them... - Hello, there are 28 states in our country. A separate language for every state. If you dash her that many times, I'm finished. The bottle will break. Let us go. Let's go girls. We have to attend a marriage. - Let's go. What about the injustice done to me? Daddy, sit down. Are you parents fine? Why did he board the same flight? This is our seat. This is not a bus to claim for your seat. This is my seat. Take your hands off. Are you so weak? Are you scared of falling in love with me if you sit next to me? Then go. The locket will not fly the flight safe. It's the pilot in the cockpit who will fly it safe. This is my mother's locket. It's a sentiment. Wear your belt. Should I do whatever you say? I don't know whether you will fall in love with me or not. But if you don't put seat belt, you will fall down. Is it salt? Is it pepper? Thank God I didn't sneeze. Careful! You might spill it on you. I was warning you. You should've listened to me. But you won't. Now shall I eat? Where is my cherry? You want one more? No, this one is tasty. What if she got angry? She won't. Because I know astrology. You know astrology? Tell me about my future. See my hand. - My hand. You dashed me first. So, you must see my hand. Okay. Since I dashed you, I will see your hand first. Give it to me. Why did you draw that? This will tell you whether you will fall in love or not. You will fall in love. The one you will love is not an ordinary man. He didn't even spare a cherry. You will fall in love for sure. Would I also fall in love? - Take your hands off. Idiots. He knows nothing. He will tell you what he told her. Sit down. - You are wrong. The shapes might be the same but the lines differ. Why are you so angry? Is it because I didn't see your hand? I don't have to. All of them will reach their destination. But you won't. We've have 6 hours for our next flight. Let's go round the city. Won't you stop drinking even while in transit? The human life begins with a milk bottle. And my life surges ahead with a liquor bottle. Make sure you don't end up with a saline bottle. It's very nice. - What are you looking at? You will find the same design in our city Samshabad. Come with me. I will show you the city. Come. He will take us to the city. I know what he will show you all. Look. That's his character. Why are you staring at her? What did you see? If boys don't see at this age, then having eyes are a waste. What will you get if you see? - An ecstatic joy. The greatness of men is that they share their happiness with others too. You are right. I feel happy by telling my friends all that I saw. How will you feel happy? If a girl smiles at me, I will tell my friends that she gave her number. If she really gave me her number, I will tell my friends that she invited me to the restaurant. What if she really invites you to a restaurant? I will tell my friends that she held my hand and felt happy. Then what? I won't tell them that she ditched me. I will tell them that she kissed me. If she really kissed me, I will tell my friends that we made love. Now that we met here. What will you tell your friends? I'll add salt and pepper to my love tale. All you men are the same. Sick fellows. Mia... Mia... She is the girl made in India... Why did God made you like this? With a /2 kg. Of beauty... you girls have /4 kg. Of arrogance... With a kilo of over-action, they play with men's lives... With half a dozen shades of coyness... and good doses of shakes... and with a dozen of sexy moves, you confuse men. You walk into lives like January and leave in December... You guys are like the calendar... You always look out for the new and discard the old... You guys are like the computer... You empty boys' pockets for films, fun and snacks... But in the end, you call it as just friendship... You make them pay for your bills... And praise them as the Bill Gates... But when people ask you about him, you introduce him as your cousin... You men find our faults with a microscopic vision... You guys add pepper and salt to the gossips... If we praise your beauty, you will worship us with flowers... But if we point out your mistakes, you turn into a terror... If we dance to your tunes, you call us God... But if you get any suspicion, you turn into a Tsunami... We are getting late for the flight. Make it fast. - Anju, move. Get in Vasu. Daddy, you get down. Let him sit. You come. No need. Uncle, you go. Looking for a chance to sneak through. It's getting late. Get in. We are late. If we fight in public, they might mistake that there is no unity among Indians. Get in. For spending only 6 hours with you, you are taking me alone. It's a new place. Hope you don't take me somewhere and misbehave with me. I got suspicious with your looks. It's getting late. Shit! Oh God! We missed the flight. Let's catch the next flight. What happened? It's all because of you. I missed the flight because of you. Don't be childish. We can catch the next flight. Can a marriage wait till then? Won't the marriage take place without you? How is that possible? These auspicious thread, jaggery and cumin seeds aren't any ordinary things. I got the blessings of Lord Balaji in Tirumala. These are with me. My passport is with my uncle. How will the marriage take place? All you want is to go there on time, right? Come with me. Can't you put that off? Men smoke whenever they are tensed. What if your husband is a smoker? Will you adjust with him? I won't marry such guy. - Then, who will you marry? First, he shouldn't smoke. Can he drink? - No. No drinks at all? - He can drink in parties. What if he has to dance in parties? He must dance with me only. Not only that, he must come home by 6 p.m. What if he doesn't come? Doors close. What if he knocks your neighbour's door? Divorce. You've decided to split. You've no intentions to live with him. Why do you have to carry them to get divorced? Why do you have to cry for being late? Didn't you bring that along with jaggery and cumin seeds? That? The one you keep in bride's hands. Green and round. Tender coconut. I'm bored drinking Coke and Pepsi. If you give me that, I will drink. I would break your head with it if I had one. I'm getting tensed. But you're busy cracking jokes. Shall we do something to relieve you from tension? What? You've items, right? - What? I mean the items in your bag. You tie a marriage bandanna and I'll tie one, let's keep cumin seeds and jaggery on each other's head, if I tie the knot with the auspicious thread that you've, that'll make us man and wife. After that comes the real fun. Fruits, milk, flowers... I'll use the auspicious thread differently. How? - I'll use it to kill you. My heart? - Has it stopped? No, the train has stopped. Let's get down. How are we to reach our destination? Do you know to swim? - No. Do you know ride a bicycle? I know. - You ride I'll sit. I'll not ride. Then I'll ride, you sit. - I'll not. You don't want to ride or sit, what can you do then? Come, let's go that side. We have to get lift from passing bus or truck. She behaved rude with me but now sleeping peacefully on my lap. We have reached the place. Where are you? Me...? We missed the train and coming in a truck. You missed flight, train, will you come here as Miss? Crook! Whatever he says happens immediately. She's blaming me for all mishaps. Please don't flatten this car tyres. I'll be blamed. My words synced with the incident. God let me down! Oh my God! God, why did you put this crook on my back? Whatever God does is for our good, you must take it like that, think positively, or else we'll be losers. Go... go on. Where are the cumin seeds and jaggery? I got tensed. Why are you leaving? Bless the new couple and go. We got your luggage, you got my daughter. You come in, you take him in. Greetings. Bad dream is over, pack him from there only. What happened? Asking coolly, everything happened because of you. The Priest you invited from India had troubled someone on arrival, he has been arrested, I warned you long not to allow all this nuisance, isn't it marriage if you exchange flower garlands and bless them? You invited trouble in the name of customs and traditions. Isn't it marriage without keeping cumin seeds and jaggery on head, and tying the auspicious thread? Throw it! Will you forget customs and traditions on reaching new shores? You asked can't marriage go on without these things? Do you know it's value? This cumin seeds and jaggery, they mix so much that you can't separate them, They keep it on head of bride and groom to tell them to mix like it, this is auspicious thread, 'Mangalam' means auspicious, 'Suthram' means thread, once tied to the neck, marriage becomes holier than fire, when in In-laws' place don't forget parents' home, when in parents' home don't forget In-laws' home, to remind this to the bride there are two pendants in the thread, yellow rice is poured on head is to usher wealth into the family, each step has a meaning in the seven steps the new couple take, first step is for food and water, second step is for happiness and comforts, third step is for holy vows, fourth step is for children, fifth step is for wealth, sixth step is for cattle and agriculture, seventh step is for intimacy, walking these holy seven steps following each other, like the sixth sense, taking husband as the fifth stage of life, with four directions as the witness, with three knots, two lives unite into one, that's a marriage! Take it. - Thanks dear. I'm ashamed. I knew what is marriage after 25 years of marriage. If you too have understood it, say sorry to him. He didn't get it. Why are you dull and sullen? - I've headache. Have a drink, it'll go. Will a drink make the headache go? Your uncle was a drunkard, he lost the property, your father too was a drunkard, he lost his life, can't it make your headache go? I was looking for you, give me a cigarette. I quit. - Why? Yesterday you quit drinking, today quit smoking. You gave a long list of reasons for marriage, tell me one reason for quitting smoking? Because the someone I like dislikes it. Have you quit for someone you like dislikes it? Are you leaving? I'm short tempered. Your program went haywire because of me. No, you short temper is your beauty. If you hadn't behaved rough in the airport, we would've parted ways, we wouldn't have travelled together till here. I wouldn't have had these sweet memories. Can't you stay back? If you like, I'll be with you all my life. Sun is so cool and moon is so hot... You've brought this change for me, my love... Bitter is sweet... sorrows are happy... You've taught me, my love... Sun appeared at midnight... Moon appeared in daytime... It happened when you smile... Clouds are on earth... Godavari River is flowing on sky... It happened when you look at me... I wrote your name thinking my name... I painted you thinking about me... Something sweet and hard hit me... I say it's not love... Try with heart to find a better word than love... I feel jealous even if air touches you... I feel jealous even if ground kisses you... When we get together, even seven lives are not enough... Gods must have worked over time to create us... Welcome bride! I don't know what you brought for us from foreign, but warden Uncle has selected a good groom for you. Come... come... Come. Did you see uncle? Your father-in-law, your mother-in-law, your sisters-in-law, introductions are over, if you come dressed as a bride, it'll get over. Uncle, I'll talk to her and come. Who is he? - Thulasi! What am I to tell them now... You go out for a moment. Forgive me Dhanunjay. Vasundhara is refusing your proposal. I arranged it in haste, please forgive me. Why are you saying sorry to me, uncle? You're her brother, I'm just a hostel warden, just a guardian to look after you till you're in hostel, once you leave hostel, we are strangers. Till now she accepted all your orders, can't you compromise only once for this? I've no other choice also, but who is he...? - Greetings sir. My name is Thulasi. If you want a rich groom, I've billions of worth property. If you want well educated groom, I've done Masters in Engineering. If you want the groom from a well respected family, my father is ZP Chairman. I didn't fall in love for her beauty. I waited till now to marry a traditional girl like Vasu. Love is not two people liking each other, it is trusting each other. If you believe ours is true love, bless us. I know I'm the odd man here. I didn't mean to insult you. After knowing your qualifications, my only option is to bless you both. Brother-in-law with brother-in-law. Now, my brother-in-law's parents. My brother-in-law's entire family. Now my brother-in-law's close friends. Make it fast, I've lot to do. What? - Make babies! Babies? How many? - 0 or 2! 0 or 2? - Not interested? I want only one son. - Just a son. Just like you. Come on... come on... Part one or two? I think the boy's father is a tough guy. It's wrong son. Come, let's go. You ate 5 eggs everyday, useless fellow. Uncle, be careful, you may fall down. What a nasty mouth! - Why did you fall down sir? Help me. Where will the genes go? Walk on dry places when you don't wear brief. Okay? You come. Got me? Help me. The trouble that broke out in a Bangalore fashion show, MP's brother was assaulted by an unidentified man, we are at his place now, let's hear MP's reaction, Sir, we came to know your brother was thrashed by an unknown man, what's your reaction to it? Nothing happened like that, it is just a minor scuffle, young men have always short fuse. You mean he wasn't beaten up? We heard he was beaten severely for misbehaving with a lady. I said accident, right? Where did it happen and when did it happen? You want another accident to happen today also. Sir, I'll talk to him. You carry on. Matter is in this, take down. Look at his style of beating. Some beat to knock-out opponents, some beat opponents to death, he belongs to the second category. He beat us in Bangalore knowing about our reputation. Get his details. It seems your mother gives you Rs.100 everyday. No, she gives just Rs.10 only. Do you have it now? - Look here! Donate! Donate! It seems your mummy gives you one rupee everyday. No, she gives me Rs.10. Where is it? Here! My money. Red Rose, to help poor children. Son, won't you thank me? Why should I? - I held you. If not you, he would've held me. You want me to say thanks, then please donate. Will you kiss me if I donate? - If you donate Rs.500 Go to the class... go to the class. I tied knot with you in haste, I'm living away for 5 years regretting for my mistake. Don't try to come closer to me by bonding with my son. I'll not allow it to happen. Ball! Close that window! What if we don't? What did break now? Glass. Next time it'll be your face. Do you think my mummy doesn't have anyone? I'm there for her. If it happens again, I'll beat you near school, I'll beat you in centre, I'll beat you in the flat, I'll beat you wherever I get you. Wow! Like father like son! If you over act, I'll not beat you ordinarily... He's not just like you but same character too. Let's go, I'm tensed. - Wait. What will he break this time? He's ogling at my mother. Today it's my mom, tomorrow it will be your moms. Any mom is same. Why is ogling at moms instead of girls? He tried to bribe me with chocolates to ogle at my mom. He may offer video games to ogle at your moms. We are kids, we may fall prey to temptation. What affect will this have on our moms? You do something. What should I do? Beat him? I can but what if a case is filed? Your dad is an SI, you must take care of it. My dad? Donate! Your dad never does anything without taking any bribe. Give him. Why are you indifferent? Is it justice to gang up against a lone man? We need moms' safety not justice. Sir, we got his address. It's two years since you're away from me, I want to see you. You're three now, I'm lucky to teach you alphabets. You're four now happily, but I'm unfortunate to miss your happiness. You've learnt alphabets, haven't you? When will you call me as daddy? Basavaraju may have found our address. Where is the gift? Where did you get this from? Opposite home uncle gave it. Opposite home uncle? Why did you go to him? I go when neighbour uncle calls, just like that I went there too. What's this, you smell cigarette? - May be uncle smokes. He has started smoking again. - Do you know uncle? Why do you want to know? You're wasting time instead of studying. Your grades have come down. If you go around the flats again, I'll beat you up. Give this to me. Son, you love your mother, right? You and mamma are friends, right? If you take gifts from strangers, mamma will get angry, right? Tell me. Didn't I get you everything you ever wanted? Recently I took you to Kids World, next week we'll go to exhibition. Buy anything you want there. Return the gift him tomorrow. Okay? Okay? I love son. Don't shout. Coming sir... What's all this? Power cut to all homes last night, only your flat has a generator... You asked to sleep in my room... - Yes sir, I told them. Please increase the AC. Your brief has holes and you too need AC. I've closed the holes these days. Dengue fever is fast spreading in the city. Close the doors too. Looks like he's sleeping by putting his legs on an another man. Last night he put his legs on you. I made him sleep on the floor. You rascal! - No sir, please... I'm very happy. The day will come when you'll play with your son. Don't you like the doll. My mom doesn't like it. The darkness is now filled with light... And now my world is filled with colours... My heart is overwhelmed with happiness... And my eyes shed the tears of joy... Shall I ask you something? Play, rejoice and never leave me... Daddy, now you go that way and I'll go this way. Daddy, you came unannounced, I hope you'll not leave unannounced. Hope you will not leave me... I swear I will never leave you. I will stay with you only. The rain was very heavy. Where are you coming from? From school. But your bag is at home. You are lying, aren't you? Who taught you to lie? - You. Did I lie? For the past 5 years. You said that we have no relation with that uncle. Isn't that a lie? You said my daddy is in America all these days. Isn't that a lie? Shut up. Your daddy is not a good man. But he said that you're a very good woman. You are lying for the past 5 years. You said that we have no relation with that uncle. Isn't that a lie? You said my daddy is in America all these days. Isn't that a lie? After so many years of separation, why does he want to enter into my life again? Why every thing wrong is happening to you? What stage is that in? Advanced stage. He will live only for few months. Any reaction must be visible. I know. Why do you want to vacate the flat? Is it because of the man staying in flat 204, right? Look... What do you want? His leg or his hands? Or to beat him to pulp. Or his life? Decide? Just make him vacate the flat. If I don't make him vacate the flat, I will change my name. A man has rented one of my apartments recently. I don't like him. I don't like him. If you didn't like him, why did you let him the place? To show off. Usually I deal such things myself. If I get into the act, I fear that I may kill. Go and get into the act. If I commit a murder, my tenants will lose a father. So, I am giving this chance to you. His photo. Photo? Won't you change? Checked lungi, vermilion, chewing betel leaves. You won't change. Where does he stay? Why would I come to you if he stays elsewhere? He lives in my apartment. This is advance. Tell me. Boss, he is here. Is he in Bangalore? I want a teddy bear. Give me that teddy bear. - This one? Rs.10. - Is this okay? Okay. - Take it. Harsha... Your mom is getting worried. Let her worry. She has made you worry. Daddy, shall we have ice creams? Daddy should not eat ice creams. - Why? I'm allergic to it. - Then, I don't want it too. Daddy, playground is very near. Shall we go there and play? - Okay. I want my daddy. I want mummy too. I want you both. I've been looking for you with seething vengence for the past 5 years. I won't allow someone else to kill you. I want to kill you myself. Wait Harsha. Get up daddy. Get up daddy. Get up daddy... get up daddy. I want my daddy. I want my daddy. Come. What's in your hands? Why are you shivering so badly? - Fever. There is a widespread fever. - It's not that kind. This fever is from fear of retribution from Thulasi. What can he do to you? You don't know his power. I saw with my own eyes. 20 men from this side... 20 men from the other side... What's his background? Listen son. Fours and Sixers. Sachin has scored a century. Why are they batting so well after your death? What are you talking? - He always asks me for the score. He felt very happy when somebody hit a four or a six. His life is cut short. Umpire is very bad. Oh no! He is here. He will create a havoc here. That's... Who killed Thulasi? Your brother or my son? Your son. He killed him with these hands. A 5 year vengeance. Everyone was waiting to know who will be killed first. Atlast, he died at your son's hands. When our enemy is killed, time and men don't count. It's important not to leave any traces. Since his son is dead, Dasaratharamaiah might target us. My son is dead. I must do something. His son might come to see his father. Kill his son there. That's all. Eat. I don't want to eat. I said eat. - No, I don't want. I'm telling you. Eat. Madam, he is in ICU now. His condition is very critical. Where are you going? God, save my father. If he knew that they were looking for him, he might have been little more cautious. It was a sudden attack. But she left him on the road. I don't know what to say. It's been 5 years since they were separated. So what? How could she leave him in such a critical situation? Do you know the reason for their separation? Because of their ego. That's not the real reason. It's dusk to me when your eyes look into my eyes... It's dawn to me when your eyes devour my body... These moments of union are the life's boons... We must be an ideal couple to this world... I'll be with you all my life... I'll protect you all my life... I'll not live without you... I'll become smile on your lips... I'll become the first blushes on your tender cheeks... I'll become moonbeam to keep darkness away from you... I'll become your breath to be with you always... I'll become the red colour kissing your feet always... I'll become gentle breeze to blow on your sweating brows... What's the matter? - Bill. Why? You've married. So what? - We had a party. How much? - Rs.2999.99 paise. Bata rate? - No, bar rate. Rs.6 for naphthalene balls? Why? Pradeep must smell it after a bout of drinks, otherwise he'll throw up. Let him lick it, that will end his trouble. One more bill? What for? You went on a honeymoon, right? Why did you celebrate our honeymoon? When boss enjoys, staff must also join the fun. What for this? You didn't invite us for house warming function. You had a party for that too. - Yes sir. Come here. When boss works, staff should also work, right? Certainly sir. What should you be doing? Bill... - I'll take care, you go. - Okay. What happened Vasu? Where is Harsha? Congratulate me, brother-in-law. Are you getting married? You're getting a rival at home. My nephew... - This must be celebrated. Who are you calling? - My mother. I think it's better to take this news personally. That's it! Brother-in-law! Why did he come now? Come my dear, some crooks didn't like my son becoming the Chairman, they kidnapped our men, they will perish, they will get disseminated. Collector, countermand the elections. - Why? Please countermand it. Are you worried about our majority? - No! This is not your popularly voted majority. Majority won by kidnapping people. We didn't kidnap them, they came on their own. So what? Jeetendra, release my men. I'll not release, what would you do? Will you hack me? Give me the sickle. Take it, hack me. Hack me. Strike here to cut into two pieces. Jeetendra, the path chosen by you is wrong. You know it, right? Then withdraw. If not you'll die. You'll die! Stop... stop... stop... Why are you getting enraged? Will you kill that elderly man? Why are you inviting trouble from him? He's little mad. He may really kill you. What's your grouse now? - Release my men. Your men? I heard they liked our party ideals and joined it. If they are your men, take them with you. Let them go. Send them Go! You tried to help them by giving food, I tried to play with their fear, our political cultures differ so much. My type of politics rule the roost, no use of brain here, only the brawn rules here. Why are you biting teeth? Hands are also shivering. Are you the son who studies in the far away city? What's your name? What's in a name? Your father is very smart. He wants you to be alive so he sent you away to study. If you get involved into this, you'll go to the never returning place. Collector! Will elections go on as scheduled or not? Elections will be conducted. Let's go. Come, let's go. We have won! Go home and sleep, not satisfied with men you've already, one more has joined. Dasaratharamaiah is a spent force, spare him. He's going away, let him go. There's no man here to stand up to us. I've tonsured my head before the elections. All of you come to enjoy the party. I propose Jeetendra's name for Chairman. Raise hands who second him. Why did you keep quiet when they were mocking at us? He was doing it to provoke us. I came back to get our men out of trouble. Stop the jeep. Where is the younger one? Boss... you sign the papers, I'll take care of him. You go inside. Reverse the jeep. Thulasi is walking demolition squad... A man with superhuman strength... A walking ruthless weapon against evil... Lord of death... Angry young man... Never leaves the enemy... A pouncing lion... roars... This is routine for us, let him sign the paper. The count is in our favour, let him sign. Come on sign. Sickle! I'll knock down Thulasi's head in one shot! I thought you were away. Quick, he may come. I'll go to my home! You wished to get hacked! Come! You twisted your moustache! Come on do it now. You slapped on your thighs, come on do it now. You and your men may take two men from my home, but I'll beat you in your place, near school, beat you near temple, beat you in every house you go, I'm Parvathaneni Thulasiram! You've been selected unopposed for your ideals and your son's style. Long Live Dasaratharamaiah! What happened? - Son... what's all the blood? A small tiff. - Small tiff? Big fight. He interfered in an unnecessary fight. Unnecessary to me? You may keep quiet watching someone holding dad's collar, I'll hack him! What if anything had happened to you? Cremate me, that's all! My life isn't precious than my father's honour. What are you saying? You don't know anything, go inside. - No... This is my family matter, go inside! Your family? Is it the way to speak to your wife? You came home first time after marriage, why are you getting involved in trouble? You want me to watch fun enemy making mockery of you and your men. To think about that I'm here, your brother, uncle, all my men are there. But you're the lone man to think about her. Today you're not just Dasaratharamaiah's son, Vasundhara's husband too, she refused the proposal her uncle had brought, she married you, women are never selfish, she always prays for husband's safety, son, everywhere enmity dies with death, but in this region enmity begins with a death, you're not unaware of it. Look dear, in his childhood when someone wiped my name from the wall, he cut his hand. He threw bombs at a man's house for insulting his brother. If we beget such a son in this region, we rejoice and celebrate it. But I sent him away from here to study. Today he's your man. When man and wife understand each other very well, they will live happily all their life. Forget about things that happened here. I'll arrange to send you to Hyderabad tomorrow. You'll not face any problems. When he beat you in the heart of the hometown, why did you spare him alive, father? Could've given me a ring. How can TV spectators know the situation on the cricket ground, only the batsman on ground knows where he's sweating? Brother-in-law! It's 25 years since I took to weapons. He took to weapons after reaching 25 years. It'll take 25 years to recover. Dasaratharamaiah is like a sea, he surges ahead or backs off according to the situation, but his son is a tidal wave, he washes away the place clean, he humiliated me, he took away my position, we were like lions here, he cut short us to street dogs, What am I to tell the CM now? I'll not allow him to live. I'll not let our honour go to the dogs. Calm down, they are way ahead of us, do you know where he is? He has already left to Hyderabad. Nothing, my parents died in a clash, since then she's scared of violence, nothing more than it, brother-in-law. It'll not happen again. Hello, it's me speaking, not Cococola aunty but Kokapet aunty, evening there's a launch in my home. - It's lunch! That's what I said, you must make it without fail. Is my voice breaking up? I think battery low, I must insult many more... It's invite not insult. - That's what I said. I'll call later, you cut the line. I thought of buying this house, I gave up because it's dirty, it's okay to you, we are very rich, you see. It'll not suit us. Want to know who I'm? People in the colony call me as Kokapet aunty. Is Kokapet your surname? - No, it's not. I was doing milk business then, they used to call me milk aunty, I got so much money by selling an acre of land in Kokapet, my husband brought saris and jewels for a million, he'll not listen if I refuse, he insists what I wear must be exclusive, when I say people will cry in jealous, he says cries will help the neem to grow. What's this satire? Laugh can make stones bloom. Is it? We say like this in my place Ibrahimpatnam. Come... come... Vasu, Kokapet aunty... - You keep quiet, I know your tale. Yours is a love marriage. It seems you trapped her in a week over flight. Listen carefully why I'm telling you this, see that she doesn't fall for another man like you. Once fallen, it'll carry on. Why did you come now madam? I'm seeing you here for long, who are you? Servant? When owners are discussing, don't you know servants shouldn't meddle? Please come and sit her. On this? Why are these sofas like this? How are they? Don't they look very cheap, boy? Sister hates cheap things, isn't it sister? - Yes, I hate. Shall I switch on the fan? - Have you gone mad? Want to switch on fan? Who is she? Who? - Ultra rich! They keep their cattle also in AC rooms. They clear the dung in silver plates. How dare you switch on fans for her, you bloody idiot. You must switch on AC. Isn't it sister? - You're right. What you said is good but why is your language like that? My slang is like that. It'll be good to say but bad to hear. Would you like to have coffee? Coffee? No. Her complexion will tan. She'll lose grammar. It's not grammar, it's glamour. Is it? I'm poor in English, sister. Isn't it Vasu? He's retorting, come let's go. There's party in home today evening, I came to invite you, today is our wedding anniversary. - You mean death anniversary? What's that nonsense? It's marriage anniversary. Say marriage anniversary. Will there be meals? - Who do you thing sister is? Kokapet! Won't there be a grand feast? Chinese, French, Turkey, many more, you would've paid Rs.100,000 for the cook, right? It's difficult to bear you. I don't know how this young girl is managing you. There are many VP's to be invited. It's VIP's not VP's. You'll say that and I'll say that's what I said, come let's go. You don't forget it. - Okay. Where is Vasu? Sister! Your sister is laughing. Thanks to Kokapet aunty. Take a good snap, jewels must be seen. Welcome... welcome. I'm happy you made it to our marriage university. It's anniversary not university. You'll say this and I'll say that's what I said. If you're filthy rich, everyday is a big party. Isn't it? - Real estate boom. Welcome. Arrangements are excellent. I wanted to arrange party in Taj Punjagutta, neighbours are from middle class, I'll lose my honour if they come in scooters and autos. - Is it? I thought they wouldn't allow you in Taj, so arranged it here. You never leave any opportunity. He'll not leave even if there's no opportunity. Who is he? Accepting all gifts, your servant? Servant? He's my husband. They say there's a woman behind every successful man, my wife is behind me. One wife brought you this luck, one more wife would've been more luckier? I'm more than enough for him. How much you paid for this sari? Just Rs.3.5 lakhs only. - Rs.3.5 lakhs? I too don't have one. You're lying, will there be such a costly sari? They gave a diamond necklace too with the sari. Men in our homes drink it as an appetizer before food. What is this? - Opium drink! Cadmium? - No opium. Why is it like lime? It's great before having food. Very tasty. Dear... - If I don't sister may fool. It's feel not fool. - I'm poor in English sister. My English will improve with few drinks. He's gone crazy, you take care. Come It's party, just once not a regular. Spare this time. I'm a train... I'll never run steady... Heat my engine with your caressing hand... I'm a fast running wheel... Once I start I'll not stop... Put my train on tracks and pull it over... Near Miryalaguda station... I spread smiles with my beauty... City boys proposed and I disposed them... I was chewing betel leaves near the Bibinagarjunction... Seth Lal made overtures and I said no to him... I came running away from there and stopped here... Why did you stop here babe? Bobbili Raja is here who stopped me with his red flagged eyes... O moving train... O unsteady train... My caressing touch will blow up your engine... O running lady... Stop running... If you come into my way, your tracks with get worn out... If you say yes... I'll get my AC bogie decked up like honeymoon suite... Looks like you can't hold on anymore... If you issue a ticket I'll take a tour... Decking the cot with flowers... Filling the room with fragrant scents... I'll spread a bed exclusive for you, let me taste the ice cream... Swinging like the swings... Crossing mounds and curves... I'll reach the valley... Let me have a ball with you in the curves and turns... If you give little place... I'll spread the bed... I'll enter the cave and uncover your secrets... If you blow the whistle... I'll throw up my sari like green signal... I'll occupy the window seat... Under the cover of darkness... I'll play to make you squeak in pleasure... I'll detrain all the passengers... I'll give all free passes to you... With great pleasure I'll give myself to you happily... Take me on a ride of fun, frolic and romance... Be careful... come... you go to sleep first... Brother-in-law, your dance was great! Sleep for sometime. One more thing brother-in-law. - What? I love you brother-in-law, take good care of my sister. Brother-in-law! I can't sleep if lights are on. My brother-in-law is great! Stop the vehicle. What's it uncle? Narendra's son is doing real estate business in Hyderabad. He's searching for you, be alert dear. What can he do uncle? Listen to me, just be alert. Okay. - Don't say okay, be alert. Where is Krishna Yadav's house? There! 4! - Let's go. Kill or settlement? Settlement. I don't come for settlements. My job is adding or removing. Cricket is in final overs, I'm tensed. They may lose if I'm not here. - No brother... Go! I'm here, play bravely. Another 4! Clean it carefully. Do you know where did I get this from? Bangkok Rs.2,000, it's very expensive. Seeing you after long time, you're a real estate owner, right? You asked for 5 acres 5 months ago but never came back Can't you sell it now? Can the rates remain same, brother? It has changed dramatically. - Why would it change? You didn't change, I didn't change, land hasn't changed, why rate would change then? Good one, is it steel vessels business to remain unchanged. Hubby! Why are you beating my wife? Sign the paper. We are cowherds doing milk business for livelihood, please spare us. Stop! How many times will you sell the same property? You signed a similar document for me too, you sold me earlier and selling it again to this idiot, this fool will come to my farm tomorrow, and claim it as his own, I'll get angry, then I will... this fool will come seeing it... didn't I tell you? That fool will also come. Do you know who is my boss? Boss... who is he? Who cares your boss is? Hey stop boys! Why are you beating us? Why are you beating him? For land. I'm beating you for them. Bash him up boys! 6! Another 6! I'm dead, he fell on me! Whomsoever it may he'll die today. What man? Your ill fate! He's dead! Got the stick? I told you this. - What? He's the man who beat all our men in ZP office. Bash him! Brother, you forgot down! Stop... enough of the stick. Come... I'll not spare you, I'll kill you and your entire family. I'll kill all of you. I'll not spare you... Bloody rogues! You saved us like God. He'll not trouble you anymore. If anyone comes, tell me. I too have a land problem, if you please tell your husband... I'll pay the fee. Drink, it's cool, it'll cool you. Stop it. - I'll stop it. Anyway we lost it, our boys have got used to losing. They go like heroes but come back bashed up miserably. Brother, talk to Sharad Pawar and change the team. The team that needs to be changed is my team. If I had been there... You would've lost the second leg too. Don't shout at me, what can you do to him? My foot! You got all fours and younger one got all sixers! Two no balls too. They too went for sixes! Whatever it is our bowlers are weak, they can't bowl him out. Brother! - Bloody idiot! There are rules for hunting. You can't hunt a lion like you hunt a deer. I want a man to hunt lion. Daddy, Minister is here. Where is he? - He refused to come. What did you do? Feed it to the dogs. Keep it inside. We have come to the right man. Tell me. Why don't you answer the phone call? I've gone crazy. I refused your choice and married my choice, What's it, Vasu? I'm enduring it. Didn't get me? Come home immediately. What will you tell him? I'll tell him I married a goon not an engineer. What happened to you? I'm fine, the hidden factionist inside you is out again. There's no connection between them. Why did you interfere in their trouble? If they invite for party, you'll go and enjoy their hospitality, but it's wrong to help them in trouble. There are many people in the colony, nobody else bothered about it, why did you only got angry? Your bloodline is like that. You belong to a factionist's family. Why do you talk about my family? Isn't yours a factionist family? So what? Do we always roam with weapons? Whatever it is, you're reconized as a goon here. Only you call me as goon, they call me as God. You saved her husband, so she'll call you as God. Every punch you hit for your father, your neighbour, what if it comes back for you? Which God will come to my rescue? Are you scared they will harm me? Why do you feel they will not harm you? Let them come, I'll kill them. - It seems somebody beat my men. Come out! Thulasi, listen to me! Tiger... I like the fun of hunting a tiger. I beat your men, you've come for me. Beat me. Tell me. Stop! We must kill a tiger not a dog. Come on boys. Brother-in-law... what happened? How dare they beat you! You've to sacrifice something to get something. I want my wife, so I had to sacrifice violence. Knowing your power, I've come to you... Spreading the bed... spreading the sheets... I met you... I won your heart... Latching the door... with great interest... Eagerly waiting for you, your love is waiting with open heart... Wait with batted breath to bear my love attack... I changed my surname... I made myself more glamorous and youthful... Putting all trust on you... I tolerated all these days... Shall I make you mine? Taking you into my arms, shall I suck all the beauty in you? Shall I immerse you in my beauty and cover myself with your warmth... I'll come and taste your sweet fruit... I'll share my warmth with you... And I will never separate from you... Like the chimes of the anklets... like the banging doors... I'll take you in my embrace... I'll drizzle like the clouds... I'll flash like a lightning... I'll rock like a thunder by falling on you... I like you... I'm mad about you... I'll come to you to share the sweetness in me... I'll come and pinch you... I'll play the game of "Hide and Seek" with you... Look at your father. My dear... Did you wash your hands and legs? Why? - Infection. Oh God! Even I will get married and have children. I'm his uncle. I went to temple and offered special prayers for him. Can I apply this sacred ash on his head? Go ahead. If he has to apply the sacred ash, you must sign this bill. What are you wearing? To avoid infection. What's this bill? We have fixed Rs.10,000 for the party we are going to celebrate. Rs.10,000? But you spent only Rs.3,000 on my marriage. Marriage is like an exam. Giving birth to a baby is the result. We enjoy more when we get the result, don't we? Okay. Take it and enjoy. If you're so busy throwing parties, when will you work. Partying is also a kind of work. That's my philosophy. You survive because of your tongue. When is the child's birthday? He is just an hour old. Idiot. It will take a year. The gap is too big to party. When is your birthday? It is just to throw a party... If you have any problem, leave it. How dare you hit my brother-in-law? You scoundrel! Where is that peanut ball guy? I tickled the white woman who was sitting next to me. She mistook him as the culprit and is fighting with him. Today, he will be beaten to pulp. He is finished. Harsha, what happened? Stop. Stop I say. What happened? Can't you see me talking to him? What happened? What more should happen? You will be fine. You will be okay. Take care of my sister. Take care of my sister, brother-in-law. I can't sleep if the lights are on. What? Don't you want to know the truth? No need. I know everything. On the other day, you took their stick to win my trust. You haven't changed. And you will never change. This life is not ours alone. It also belongs to our children and our parents. Can't you live with me for his sake? I'm leaving for his sake. I'm leaving to protect his life. One can take hasty decisions in love and marriage. But one shouldn't take hasty decisions and get separated. I lost my brother infront of my eyes because I delayed taking this decision. Go away. You may not need me but I need you both. I don't need you. If you call me or if you send your parents for a compromise, we both will die. I swear on our son. The condition of the patient in the ICU has improved. I'm coming. Thulasi might regain consciousness. Inform his parents who are waiting in the reception. I want my daddy. My son... Hope my son is okay? - He is fine. Careful Chinna. Doctor adviced not to move. I want to see my son. He is fine. Why trouble yourself? I want to see my son. Go. Go if they are more important than us. Son... Son... Atleast you tell him. He can't understand his health condition. Let him tell me that if he can't live without his son, I will go the to court and get his son back. What happened? What? What happened? What happened? Tell me. Thulasi, tell me what happened? My son won't live long. He will die. What is he saying? Yes uncle. The child's brain is affected with a cyst. His condition is very critical. But still, we are getting doctors from abroad. Anything might happen at anytime. That's why he is very tensed. If my son gets hurt, I will not be able to bear that. Not knowing whether he is live or not, how could you bear that pain? Why are you so sad? The school will be over in a month. Why do you need a TC now? We are shifting our place? Please, give me the TC. Are you going to leave the school? Won't you come back here? Are you going to your husband's place? - Yes. Someone shot his father in the exhibition yesterday. Your daddy will be fine. Let's pray to the God. Come. Daddy... Son... Son... What happened to you? What's wrong with me, daddy? You will be fine. You will be fine. Where is Harsha? His daddy took him. Uncle, where is my son? Sit down for a minute. We need to talk to you. Don't try to convince me. I want my son back. There is no one in the room. You, your love, your memories... I miss you Vasu. What you're looking at is the truth. You took your son to Dr. Surekha when he had fever, do you remember it? It's not an ordinary fever. It's a killer disease. Doctor told this truth to Thulasi. You think he took your son away from you. But he wants his son to be happy for the remaining part of his life. I asked him whether he told you this. He said that if he tells you the truth, you will die. He cried. It's very critical case. We have slim chances. Something is wrong with me, daddy. But still I am very happy. You wouldn't have come if this didn't happen. I want to be with you always. It's time for his operation. It's getting late. Thulasi, don't worry. He will be fine. I left his once, I got separated from him for 5 years. If I leave his hand, I don't know whether he will come or not? God will not harm good people. Some one has kidnapped Harsha. We have given him the medicines. If he is not operated in 40 minutes, he will die. Hey, come. Come. Come. Kill him. Stop. We don't need to hurry. But he should. His son will live for another 29 minutes only. Sir, he only a kid. Leave him. All you need is me. It's getting late for his operation. The pain you are undergoing now, I've been experiencing it for the last 5 years. I will kill you in 27 minutes and after you have experienced the same pain. It's getting late for his operation. Since I failed to kill you that day, I lost my two sons. You didn't kill my sons infront of my eyes. But I will kill your son infront of your eyes. That's a real man. He is only a kid and he also has a disease. Let's spare his life. But we will kill him. It was my sons who died. Daddy, I can't see properly. Good. Thought you can't see, cry for help with your mouth. Call your father. Call your father. Now blood. Next he can't breathe properly. Next... he is gone. Son... Go... There is no time. There is no time. Didn't I tell you that I have no time. I will kill you. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Let's go. You got only 3 minutes. Come. I failed to be a good husband. I wanted to be a good father. I took him away without your knowledge. That's my mistake. You said you will leave only from the house but not from my heart.
