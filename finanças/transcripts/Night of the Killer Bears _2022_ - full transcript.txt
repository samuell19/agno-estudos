What do you need? When did you get here? Just now. Why did you ring the bell? I thought you were sleeping. You look really tired. No, I had to prepare some things. I can help you, if you want. Just finish your own work, all right? Yes, ma'am. Can I have an iced Americano, please? -Yes, of course. -Okay. Sit down. Thank you. The fourth coffee. When you're done with it, go home. But my work is not finished. So what? You haven't progressed? No, I have not. I need some help to go faster. What can I do? Help me with my work, or sit here and cheer me up while I work. Is that a joke? I still have to clean all of this. That's not true. There are no customers left. Please leave, I have to close today. It's only six. On weekdays, the coffee shop's slow. Dear customer, please finish your coffee quickly and go home now so I can close early. And why are you closing early? I have a date with my boyfriend. He is visiting me from Bangkok. Oh, I didn't know that. Mmm. I never told you about him? No, you didn't. That's weird. I could swear I did tell you, you know? Oh, so what does he do for a living? Well, he's an engineer. He travels a lot, so we barely see each other. So, I have to close early. Can I help you? No, I'm okay. You just finish your work so I can clean up. Hello? I want some coffee, please. I'm sorry, it's already closed. Is it the time to close? Usually we close at eight, but today I had to close early. Okay, then. It's dark outside, be careful if you go out. Yes. Hello? Do not go outside. Who are you? I just want to talk to you. You're giving me the chills. I'm not gonna hurt you, if you talk to me. Well, stop it. I'm not talking to you, don't be such a weirdo. Why do you look terrified when you see me? Are you not happy? I came here to see you. Like it? I dressed up and I waited for you. Look. How do I look, handsome or what? I took a picture of you. So pretty. Even when you're sleeping. Mmmmm. Just look at this. All the things you like. Don't you like that? You don't like this exquisite dinner? Hmm? Oh man, I forgot, you're all tied up. Well, now we should celebrate. And I wanted to tell you something. The person you're waiting for, he's probably not gonna make it tonight. Why are you doing this? 'Cause I want you for me. And also, you shouldn't be going out with other people. What are you saying? We like each other. You said it yourself, you like talking to me. But it's my job, and-- No, it's not! You have to understand that you... are only mine. I'm not. You're, You're lying to me. -But it's true. -You're lying. You're lying! -I'm not lying. -You're lying! -I'm not-- -You're lying! These are lies! -I'm not lying. -You're lying to me! You're a fucking liar! You're lying! You're...lying! You're lying! You're lying to me! You're lying! Lies, lies, lies! Stop lying to me! Liar! You're lying, you're lying! You're lying, you're lying! Lies, lies, lies, lies! Lies! You're lying to me! Oh my God. Oh, no. Ron, thank you for killing him for me. He died without me having to sweat even a little. I really have to thank you. You know, I've waited for this for so long. Waiting for the right time to kill that son of a bitch. Where are you crawling to? Didn't you wanna talk to me? We have so much to share. We can spend time together. You don't have to go. We can be together forever. Sorry, I got carried away. Tell me something. Do you wanna maybe listen to your kids music? No, it's not kids music. It's called acoustic music. Do you remember when was the last time you saw them? It's been a while. Even years. I must call Tony. What bear has beautiful hair? What bear has beautiful hair? Just think about it. Hold on, hold on. Put your heads together. I want an answer, girls. I'll come back for it. Who is it? Hello? What's up, man? Where are you? I'm interviewing for a job, a big one. And it's so damn hard, but I have to do it. Okay, don't be late. Hey, Will, would you do me a favor, please? Tell, Amy me that I want a king size bed, not a double one. You know, I like to sleep with someone. Sleeping alone is lonely. I'll tell her. Okay, thanks. Hey, man. Got the goods right? Yeah, I brought them. You're the man. See you later. Okay, see you, bruh. Okay, bye. Have you come up with an answer, ladies? What goods? Um, wine. Tony wants some wine. You sure? Yes, dear. Hey, can you call Nan? No, we're not done talking. You and I aren't clear yet, we couldn't be less clear. Just because Mom died doesn't mean you know anything about me. You'll never know how kind he is. I know you're scared that I'll turn out like Mom, and I don't wanna fight with you anymore. But you-- Okay, wait. Hello? I'm in the middle of casting actors. I'll be home soon. Yeah, sure, baby, that's all. Okay, that's enough for now. Thank you for coming to audition. Hello, are you ready? Just finished auditioning, but I have another one. Okay, okay. When you're done, be on your way, miss you. Okay, I miss you, too. I haven't seen you in a while. We have to catch up. I know. See you later. We talked and she cried. She just finished auditioning. I'll call you later. We need to arrange all the callbacks. Hello, Mr. Nan. Hey, happy to see you. I appreciate this opportunity. Oh yeah, you were so great. -Love your audition. -Thank you. I loved the script, it's wonderful. I really hope we can work together. Mmm, I hope so too, trust me. Yes. Amy, this place is weird. Really? I think it's charming, it got great reviews. There's no signal. Come on, we're here on vacation, not to watch videos. Amy, why didn't you book a resort like last time on vacation? Why this place? Relax, we'll have fun. Will? Will? What? Let's go inside. Come on. Let's go. Hey there, is anyone here? Well, let's get inside. Hello? Hello? Anyone here? Anyone here? Is anyone here, hello? Got a reservation? Yes, we do. We have one under Pancake Kamanika. Okay, let me check. Pancake, really? The actress? Mmhmm. You know I'm such a big fan of her work. She is so great. Room 237. So, where is the room? Go upstairs, to the left. It's by the terrace. Enjoy your stay. Thank you. Um. Authorities are urging residents to avoid going out and report any suspicious activity to the police. Okay. Thank you. Let's go. He's kind of weird. And where were we? Oh. So many viewers today. Do you want anything special? You know, I have a very nice surprise for you. Ooo, what could it be? I will shower in my bikini live. Is that okay? Okay, let's do it. Please hurry, I don't think I can hold it much longer. Honey, you know I can't wait to shower just for you. So tell me, what should I take off first? It's up to you. Let me open this real quick. Oh, keep going. I want to shower with you. You're crazy, how are you going to shower with me? Oh, why can't I? I'm gonna wet myself, okay? Oh, keep going. Oh, just like that. Oh yeah, very good. Oh, it's so hot. If you'd shower with me, that'd be great. I'll shower with you now, okay? Silly, how are you going to do that? Just turn around. Amy. No power. What a joy. Relax. All right, if you're cool with this, I guess I'm cool too. Come on, it's just for the weekend, baby. Okay? Mm, all right. You're the best. I'll go get the weird reception guy. Yeah, go now, hurry up. The others should arrive any minute. Yeah, yeah. Be quick. Yeah, I will. Wait here. Excuse me. Sir? Mister? Oh, there you are. Here. Who the hell did this shit? Amy. Will. I found you. You scared me. -I'm sorry. -No. I thought you said this place was charming. Will, stop it. I'm sorry, Amy. You are so silly. I was worried that you were alone. Let's make out. Just like that? Just here. Amy, I wonder how about we do something fun? How can I resist? I am finally here! Is anybody here? It's Tony. Hello? Ah. -Hey, Will! -Tony. I missed you, give me a hug. She's my girl. -Your girlfriend? -Right. Just kidding, bro. Girl. Sorry, were you waiting for long? Because we were just settling in, you know? Really? Yeah. Should I believe her? Believe her, it's true. So, how are you? Well, I'm doing just fine, just living day to day. Good times, you know what I mean, eh? I heard you were opening your own store. Trying, but we'll see. Mmhmm. We'll see. Miss you guys. Miss you, too. Nan, is she coming? She's busy, but she'll be here any minute. Okay, well. Wanna continue settling in? No, no. Or do you want me to help you with that? Thank you. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? Hello, please help me, I dunno what to do. Please help me, please. -I dunno what to do. -What happened? Please, calm down. He's not breathing. Suddenly, he pushed me and hit me, and I tried to run away, but he hit me until I collapsed. I don't know what to do, please help me, please. Help me. All right, what did he do to you? He tied me up and raped me. I don't know what to do. Please help me, hurry. What can I do? Hurry up. Stay where you are, we'll send help right away. What's wrong? Nothing. So, are you and Amy doing okay? Yeah. I apologize. He's not allowed to smoke. Just this one cigarette. I mean, in this room. Oh. Okay, then. So, everything is fine? What? Nothing. Really. Well, I just wanted to see you. It's been a long time. Here. Nah, not right now. What the hell, bro? What's going on? After that day, I'm trying to be a better man. It's just that. How long has it been? Two years? It's good. You both look good together. Why, thank you. Glad to have your approval. You don't have to care for my opinion. Do whatever the hell you want. Really? Yeah. I said no. Come on. Well, more for me. Hi, Nan. Hello, Amy. How are you? I'm good. So, here is where all the cool kids hang out. Isn't it a beauty? Well, it is. How did you find this place? My parents brought me here on a retreat. Ah, I think it's so authentic. Well, Will doesn't seem to like this place. Hello, my lady. And how was your trip? It was very long and very bumpy. And your movie? I don't wanna talk about it right now. The director sucked, but it's cool. I get to shoot a real gun, you know. You must be tired. If you want, I'll take you to your room. Sure. Why is the host so weird? Relax man, keep your cool. Sure, I got this. -Yeah, go drink your wine. -I got this. Well, the room is not fancy, but I think it's enough just for the weekend, right? Don't worry, I don't mind a little rustic charm. I'll let you settle in. See you later. Call me if you need anything. Hey, Amy. It's good to see you. Yeah, you too. Missed you. Right here? Do you have to watch me like that? Well, yeah. You're too hot. Stop it. My shirt, please. Who would've thought? What? You and me. Hey, this is a one-time thing. I don't think so. Did you see the lab reports? I left them on your desk. It looks like the hard work is going to pay off. Can you believe it? Brian? Hello, Brian? There's no signal. Do you have a reservation? Yes, I do. My friend booked it? You must be Chang. Yes, I am. Do you wanna share a room with your friend, hmm? No, just me. Just one bed, please. Is it that way? Thank you. What's up, buddy? Yo. Where the hell have you been? I was at work. Did you bring it? Of course, I did. Let me take a look at it. My beautiful. Our systems need alcohol. All right. Wait, you owe me 3,000 already. My birthday present. But your birthday isn't for another three months. It's just my present in advance. Oh, cheers! You cheap ass. Here. Thanks, bro. Whose place is this, anyway? No idea. You already know me. I'm so cool, I just turned up. Or not. What do you mean? The funeral. You forgot it. You know, I had to work. Chang, look, I was working in Korea, and to be honest, I didn't want to pay a lot of money to fly to a funeral. Cheap asshole. I thought Kang was one of your best friends. Huh? How could you, man? Why are you talking about him? Hey, I was just saying-- Well all agreed not to talk about it, didn't we? Chang. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. What took you so long? I was working. There's more to life than engineering. Oh, at least you finally figured that out after three years. It's time to party. Listen up. Pick up your cups. To my friends, my best friends, the gang of Small Paws, cheers. Wait a second, wait. So who's your friend? That's harsh, so harsh. Hey, Will. What's the matter with you? How come you don't say anything as if nothing happened? Calm down, bro. Hey, don't bro me, man. Oh, I'm sorry if I'm not in the mood for celebrations, but our friend is dead and we're acting like nothing happened. Are we not talking about it ever again? What are we even doing here? Hey, Chang. We're just to have a good time, man. We all want to move on, really. Move on? You moved on too quickly, -don't you think? -We didn't forget. This is upsetting for us, but nothing will ever bring Kang back. We should leave it in the past. Don't you think it's better? How can you, of all people, say that? I swear that you were the last person to act like you are now. You better shut the hell up, man. Come on, I think it's the best for all of us. For all? Or for you, the best friend. Chang, you gotta be kidding. People have to face the consequences of their actions. I'm warning you. Kang died because of you. But you wanted to take a dive, didn't you? It was a unanimous decision. Was it? Was it, huh? As far as I remember, you also agreed. How would I know there was a storm coming? You two, calm down. I called everyone here to make peace. Chang is right. We should drink to Kang. To Kang. To our friend. Kang, may you rest in peace. Cheers to Kang. Our boy. Cheers. Hey, hey. Chang, come on, that's enough. What the fuck is wrong with you? -What the hell? -Stop, that's enough. -You're such a coward. -Stop it, guys. Why are you doing this? Why are you like this, Chang? Chang? Let him go, Amy. You know, I was so close to not coming here. But I thought, hey, they're my friends, and friends support each other in tough times. How wrong I was. And so was Kang. Just think about it, dear friends. I'll be gone by morning. Chang, please don't. Amy. Relax. You know he's always getting like that. Leave him alone. He's okay. Let's drink. Here, pour yourself some. Let's drink. Shit. I'm running low, man. I need to call my guy. I'm running low. Why don't you smoke these? Huh? Bro, this weed, I have been saving it for the both of us. Yeah, this thing right here, it's some powerful stuff, my man. They call it the Ghost Monkey. Ghost monkey? Yeah. Why? Are we gonna see monkeys there? No, you don't see ghosts. All I know is that it's supposed to last all night long. -All night. -Yeah. You know, seeing all sorts of weird shit. Really? Yeah. He didn't pick up, I'll try again. Wait, I'll be back. There's no hurry to lighting that. I'll be back. Okay, hurry back, Tony. Hey. I really miss him, you know. Do you know how lucky you are that you weren't there? You have no idea, really. Because I'm doing everything. Finding a way to forget I saw it. But I can't forget that image. And what about Tony? Hm? I don't mean to be nosy, but I heard you two together. Well, it's nothing. It will be over by the end of the weekend. Could you not tell the guys? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Tell me, how may I assist you? This is kind of an unusual question. Do you have any weed? Anything I can buy from you? I can't reach my dealer. Do I look like a drug dealer? I'm not. But thank you for asking. Nevermind. Thanks. Is there anything else I can do for you? Perhaps you would like me to send a teenage prostitute to your room. I'm sure I can help you. What do you say? I'm okay. Goodbye. Now, where were we? Ah. Yes? Who is it? Hey, guys? Tony? This is not funny. Hey, Tony. Hey, who are you? What the fuck? Finally, we are alone here. Hm? Stop it, I'm not in the mood right now. What's going on? Tony, can we just talk? We actually never really talk. Yes. If you want to, go on. I'm worried about Chang. Don't you worry, Nan. You know he's like that. He can't be sensitive, but he'll be okay. Don't you worry. Or are we taking sides now? I'm being serious. You know, it was an accident. Accidents can and will happen, anywhere, anytime. And also, Will was right, you know? We have to leave the past behind. We can't let this follow us for the rest of our lives. And also, we're not the ones who killed Kang. We're not killers. I'm being serious, you have to stop hanging out with Tony. He smokes weed all day like a loser. Come on, babe. Hm? Gotta go to the bathroom. What the fuck? Are you kidding me? Do you have a reservation? I'm asking, do you have a reservation? Hey, did you hear that? Hear what? Mmm, you're so sexy, come here. It's coming from Chang's room. Chang, my friend. Chang, Chang, Chang, Chang, Chang? Where are you? My friend, what were you yelling about? Look. Chang. Chang? Where the hell are you? Chang, where are you? Will, wake the fuck up, Will. Wake up, wake up, wake up. It's Chang, he disappeared. It's Chang, he's gone. Come on. Wait. What was all that, Will? Amy, where were you? Tony said Chang is gone. Come on, hurry. Chang. Chang. Chang, Chang. What the fuck? We need to go, let's go. Let's go find Chang. Wait. -Let's go. -Tony. -Let's go. -Tony. -Chang? -Tony. -Tony. -Chang, where are you? -Chang, Chang? -Chang? Tony, wait, it's better to call the police. We can't do it, there's no signal here. We can drive and get help. No way, the nearest town is 30 kilometers away. Chang. What's going on? I'm freaking out. Okay, listen. We need to keep our heads cool. Do you understand that? Is that Chang? The back door, let's go, quick. -Chang. -Chang. Chang. Chang, Chang. Where are you, Chang? That sound is coming from behind. Let's go. Quick, Amy. Chang, Chang. Come on, Chang needs help. Nan. Let's go. Hurry up. I can't do this. Where are you going? Damn it! Help me. He raped me and he's going to burn me alive. Please, help me. He did it, he's gonna do something. Please, help me. Let's get out of here. We have to go. Hurry, please. Please, help me. We need to go. Please, please help me. Shut the fuck up. Chang? What the fuck? -Who would do such a thing? -Tony? Don't hold it anymore. What is going? Nan. Nan, Nan! Hey, Nan! Where are you going? Hey, Tony, where are you going? Will, you need to go find Amy. Can you do that? Go find her, I'll go find Nan, I'll meet you here. Nan. Shit. Nan. Nan. Nan? Nan. Nan. Tony. You need to help me find her. Nan, Nan. Nan. -Nan, Nan. -Nan? The key? Okay, all right, let's go find her. You...you go over there, and we'll meet over there, and then, we have to get out of here. -Tony, Tony. -We have to move. -Tony! -Nan, we have to find Nan. Calm the fuck down. Are you high? You gotta go that way, I go this way. We'll find her, okay man? -Go, quick. -Okay. Nan? Nan. -Nan. -Nan. Nan? A signal jammer. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? Officer, officer? Someone's killed my friend, we need help. Sir, where's your location? Please, give me your address, please. Sir, I need you to calm down and identify your location. I'm listening. Shit, balls. Sir, please tell me what's going on. No, it's my friend, Chang. -Hello? -It's also-- You bitch! Ta-da-da. You didn't know, did you? Are you surprised? You had it coming? I've been waiting for this for so long. Where did you guys go? Did you find Will? What, did I pay you to do nothing? Go find him right now. I'm sure he's around. Come on, pick up. Hello? Shit. What if I finish what he started? Amy. Amy. Amy. Amy. Where is she? Amy. Amy. Amy. Amy. Amy. Amy. Will. Amy. Amy. Amy. Amy. Are you okay? Amy, listen carefully. Nan. She was killed, Amy. -What? -It's not safe here anymore. We have to leave, Amy. Where's Tony? Amy, where's Tony? Amy, babe, Amy? Why is there blood on your face? Blood? Who's blood is it? Maybe it's Tony's. What have you done? I kind of killed Tony. Right, gang? Will. It's over, you're the last one. Run, Will. Run, if you think you can survive. Run, run. Bingo. Will. Help me. Help me. Somebody, help me. Help me, please. Help me. Shout all you want. Nobody can hear you, baby. Baby. Why do you want to kill me? Because it's just that Kang's death is your fault. That's why you need to pay for everything you have done. You can't possibly blame us for his death. Well, you know, I told him not to go on that trip, because it was too fucking dangerous. But he didn't listen. He wanted to spend time with his friends. You said you didn't know. You knew that there was a storm coming. All of you assholes knew it. But you had to take that summer diving. Why did you have to do it, huh? What was the purpose of it? What was the fucking purpose? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. -I didn't do it. -Sorry. Don't give me that crap. You abandoned you Kang Kang. You abandoned Kang. just the moment he needed you the most, you abandon him. Kang. Kang. You say it. Come on, you have to say his name. Kang. Good. Did you know that we have been waiting for this for so, so long? You said we? Kang and I. It's time for you to pay for what you've done. It's the least you can do. Wait, Amy, we can talk about it. Well, he is saying it's too late, honey. -Amy. -He says you have to suffer for what you've done to us. Amy, don't do it. I will kill them all myself. -Amy. -Don't worry, honey, I will. No, Amy. Amy, don't. You fuck. You've got serious relationship issues. Tony, Tony. Where the fuck did she go? Tony. Amy, she killed Chang and Nan. I know. Bitch. You shit, go to hell. She's saying King's ghost or something. Like, literally or metaphorically? I don't care. Let's get that bitch. Tony. Tony. I don't know, man. I think I shot her right in the heart. She should be dead. Trust me. -Calm down. -Are you okay? Huh? Tony, is it over? Hit her, yeah, hit her. Throw it, do it! You got this, Will. Yes, that's right, yeah. Amy, Amy. Amy, why? You ruined my life. I am going to end you. Let me do it. I will end you. No, wait. We can't do that. -Stop. -Stop! Will. Will. Will? -Officer. -Officer, please help me. These boys are trying to rape me. -Shut up! -That's not true. Don't listen to this bitch. Sir, look at me, please. That bitch. Shut up. You, shut up. Put this on now. No, no. Look at me. Look, look at my arm. That bitch stabbed me. Quiet, you damn rapist. Thank you. Thank you, officer. You're my hero. Thank you. Fucking bitch. Bro. Bro. I think I'm dying. I think I'm dying. No, you can't die on me. Please. Hold on. Will. You need to be strong, buddy. Tony, I'm dying. Are you okay now? Yes. Thank you so much, you're my hero. What happened, girl? You can die. It's good. Tony. I haven't been honest. I did something very selfish. I saw the opportunity. And I took it. Because I really wanted what Kang had. I have to live with this until the day I die. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That is really fucked up, man. Is she worth it? I think I fucked up real bad, man. You fucked up real bad. Will. You really think? Please. Help me. Thank you, he was gonna bury me alive. You are my savior. By the way, what happened to you? I don't do that anymore, but thanks. Cool. Congrats on quitting. Do you have a reservation? "Night of the Killer Bears."
