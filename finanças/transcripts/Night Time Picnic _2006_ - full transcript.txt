Anna? What? You've cracked from exhaustion! Oh no! I'm so tired, I can't stop laughing! It's your fault, Anna! Walking together . . . That's all it was, but . . . How did it become so special? You're acting strangely, Takako. About what? About the Walking Festival This is our last one! Even if it is our last one, it's still 80 kilometers! By this time tomorrow, we'll be climbing up this hill again like this. I know. You're hiding something, aren't you? It's from Anna. She's doing great in New York, isn't she? Whoa, her handwriting looks lively! Yeah. I won't be walking with you this year but a secret charm from last year will most likely be with you again. I'll be praying that it will provide a solution to your problems, so you can successfully reach your goal. I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean. A solution to your problems . . . successfully reach your goal . . . a secret charm from last year . . . secret charm? Doesn't it feel like she's with us? Huh? Yeah. Toda-kun! Nishiwaki-kun is there too! You're so lucky! There are lots of cool guys in your class! "Rescue Bus" Huh? You were on the bus already? Good luck, candidate winner! Just let me rest for a bit! Here we go! Northern High's 24 hour Walking Festival Suddenly, I'm feeling tired. Let's go! There're a lot of people! We'll be starting soon, so let's make one final check. At 20 km, we'll break for lunch, and dinner will be at 40 km. It's important to call out if your group begins to fall behind. The Group Walk will end at the sleeping area, 60 km away. Take care on the narrow portions of the highway along the way. The remaining 20 km Free Walk will begin after a nap. Thank you. I'll come over to your class during the break, okay? Okay. See you later. Good luck! Bye bye! A good luck charm. I picked it up at the shrine. Thank you. Can you walk? If you can't, there's no way you'll make it. Not in the knee! It hasn't healed yet. Sorry, old man. Are you going to run during the Free Walk? I'll decide after the Group Walk. Well, I'm going to run. Why don't you take it easy and walk with Kouda? Huh? Why with Kouda? You want to cross the finish line together, don't you? Oh no! Wow, fat! I don't believe it! Why are you going to run after walking 60 km? Because it's our last year. I'll be running with . . . Nishiwaki-kun? You want to reach the goal with the guy you like, right? I'm going with Miwako! Yeah, but Miwako is in both the Ski and Kendo Clubs, right? Anyways, if you can't make it, you can just get on the bus. Don't be mean! I want to find the father during this Walking Festival. Please help me! On this beautiful day, the time has come for the Group Walk. We can't be careless because of the lovely weather though. Let's make sure to take the proper safety precautious. This 80 km round-trip walk will end 24 hours from now With everybody working safely together, you can walk or run . . . This begins the group portion of our school's famous Walking Festival. Now then, let's have a safe trip! I'm tired! I wonder if a typhoon will come . . . This weather is perfect for a picnic! Anna's lucky she transferred . . . Say, who was the guy Anna liked? I don't know. She left before saying. What about you? Nishiwaki-kun! I've never even talked to him before! Well, you have until tonight! Tonight? I'll definitely be on the bus. There's nothing going on, I tell you! Takako . . . We don't look alike. He looked a lot different in that photo than he used to. But the eyes are definitely Nishiwaki's. I wasn't talking about Dad . . . When somebody you share the same blood with passes away . . . It's a strange feeling, isn't it? Geez! She's mad now! They're at it! Hey! Good luck! Monkey, gorilla, chimpanzee~ See? All you do is look at Kouda! Looking and seeing are different. Kouda looks at you too, you know. Actually, I think she hates me. Well, whatever . . . We've still got a long way to go. I told you, there's nothing between us! 10 minute break! Here . . . What's this? Over 10,000 steps! Look! Let's see how many calories that is! I wonder if I've gotten any thinner? By tomorrow morning, I'll have the perfect figure! What figure? I have one! Oh no, I think I'm getting a blister! Here, put this on. Thanks! Winnie the Pooh! If Godzilla were to appear . . . Everybody would run, right? Leaving only their shoes behind. Godzilla won't show up! If I can't make up silly stories, I can't go on! Godzilla! Come on! Rika! Come on! Hurry up! Come here! Oh Romeo! Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? No, no! No, no! I can't lose! I am the Crimson Goddess! Are you watching, Tsukikage-sensei? [ Reference to shoujo manga "Glass no Kamen" ] Our Walking Festival has begun. The beginning is what's important. Well said! Something more interesting . . . Isn't it unfair to make us think of more? You're the one trying to kill time. Doesn't it make you feel better to think about something else though? I guess so. No love stories! In that case, I won't tell any! How about a shoe thief with the power to change the lives of people he steals from? And? That's it. Not good enough! Think of more! Why shoes? Shoes are interesting! How about this? The thief has a strange ability. He can learn the innermost thoughts of people by wearing their shoes. Oh! Those are mine! Wait! Stop! Please! Give them back! You have a secret, don't you? A secret you can't tell to even your closest friends. What's this? You've made a bet too! And this is a secret as well? But what's the point in making such a trivial bet? You want to talk to him! And then . . . Stop it! Break time! Take a one hour break! One hour break! What's wrong? Please eat your lunch! I think she's headed for the hospital. "21 km Mark 59 km Remaining" . . . a secret charm from last year will most likely be with you again. I'll be praying that it will provide a solution to your problems, so you can successfully reach your goal. Just a whim? This is Anna we're talking about. There must be some meaning. Anna went back to America without confessing to the guy she liked, right? Yeah. I wonder who he was? She didn't say, did she? No. Alright! Let's eat, Tomohito! What's in your lunchbox, big brother? The same as you, obviously! Can we join you? Sure! Toru! Over here! Nishiwaki-kun! Here. Why are you looking at me? That's my line! I spy a gift from Mom! How cute! It is a school trip after all. Even though you're famous for being scary . . . Famous for being scary? Sort of like, "Don't come anywhere near me!" Yeah, that's the aura! Seriously? Do you think you could like a guy like this? Huh? You and Toru were in different classes your first and second year, right? Yeah. What about junior high? We went to different schools. Why do you ask? When people are dating, sometimes they'll pretend to ignore each other. It's the other way around. I think Nishiwaki-kun hates me. Wow! Toru said the same thing! There must be something going on between the two of you. I told you, there isn't! What's this? Furukawa Etsuko from Class 3 has a cousin who had an abortion. She's looking for the father. The father is supposedly in our year. Etsuko is furious about it! She's raised a huge fuss! She doesn't look anything like Furukawa-san though. She's so full of justice, she's like a public prosecutor. You must have forced a confession from him! Judge! Judge! Or maybe a civil rights lawyer? She'd definitely run for election then. A seat in the House of Councilors or something. I, Furukawa Etsuko . . . With justice on my side . . . What's the meaning of this?! But I wonder who it is . . . And is it really true? I thought this sort of thing were just made up legends. I'm sure there are plenty of guys who go around getting girls pregnant! But it's the girl's fault too. I'm going to find a vending machine. Me too! Hey, bring me some chocolate! What was that? Is chocolate not allowed? Did something happen between you and Nishiwaki-kun? I'm in Class 3! There it is! Class 7 . . . Oh . . . What is it? You're lucky to be in Class 3 . . . I'll visit your class later, okay? Some sort of trouble? Huh? With Kouda . . . A love triangle? Incompatible personalities? There's nothing, I tell you. Come on, talk to me! The road is long! You're persistent . . . You just figured that out? That's kind of weird. Rika, it's your turn. Those two are actually siblings. She's the secret daughter of the man's father . . . And that man is trying to seduce her . . . What a terrible guy. He looks so sleazy. Godzilla? Godzilla. Oh, Takami . . . What's wrong? Just a little further. Are you going to get on the bus this year again? Don't push yourself too hard. Who is it? It's Takami! A senior riding the bus? Whoa, what a loser! She should rest. I agree. Please take care of her. Rika! I'm going to wait for the bus here. Come on, try a little harder! They say that if you get through this, you'll do well on your exams. That's a bad habit, you know. Yeah, but whenever I see a dog, I just wanna tease it. You're definitely going to pay for it one day . . . Woof! It's the sea. Yup, it is. This is so pointless! Sorry. My feet feel strange. They don't feel like my own feet. Chiaki! I'm not gonna make it to become a great person! This sucks . . . Say, isn't this the place from last year? Oh yeah! Somebody died around here! Don't say that! Some swimmer, wasn't it? Remember the teacher stretching his arms out like this? He was trying to block our view, but we could see right past him! Still didn't see anything though. No way! I did see the feet! It was so white . . . and there was blood! Will you stop talking about it? I walked the entire stretch with my eyes shut! Just kidding! I'm begging you, please stop! I won't be able to walk tonight if I'm afraid a ghost will pop up! She's scared! I just remembered . . . - The ghost . . . - Yeah, me too. Same here. There was one last year. The unknown student! Wearing a white track suit and carrying a ruck sack! Did you see him too? I thought he was a first year student. He looked so young, I became really curious. The photos! Who is this? - A first year student? - No! - Transfer student? - No. He's there too! They say he's some kid who died! Here too! Chiaki, it's a scoop! Where else?! Where else?! Tell me where! Break time! Break time! Please check on the condition of your feet! Will you run properly? I've got a blister . . . Sitting like this . . . It's not unheard of to be able to see time, it is? The time we?ve spent walking until now is there . . . And the time we have left lies that way. In the same way, each moment becomes the past . . . And there's no going back. "43 km Mark 37 km Remaining" Good work! Have you seen Shinobu yet? How about a banana? It'll give you energy! How about it? Bananas! It'll give you energy! Oh, here . . . Oh, Shinobu? Good luck! You too, Nishiwaki-kun! Geez . . . What about your family? Working. Tonight too? They leave that sort of thing to other people. They've never liked all the fuss about these sorts of events. I wish mine were like yours. Now's your chance! What? Don't you want to talk to him? Why does everybody say that? Because your face says so. See? He's getting away! You can't do that! Take it back with you. I don't believe it! I heard that Uchibori-san was going out with Yabe-kun. Black widow! Uchibori-san really is unstoppable. Yabe-kun hasn't recovered yet either! They put him on the bus. Even though he's the school's ace! He has a fever. - Shall we take him then? - Yes. Can you stand? Right! That was so cute! But don't you think the pink one is cuter? Oh, that's cute too! Yeah, but it's too expensive to afford . . . The same thing happened to Tanojiro-kun from the Soccer Club! Yeah, before Yabe! That's right! All of them have been traumatized! And her next target is Nishiwaki-kun? It's already started. I heard she wants to confess during the Festival. And tomorrow is Nishiwaki's birthday. A present? I wonder what it'll be. A charm maybe? Gives me the chills! Do you want to stop her? We'll help you. Not at all! Besides, there really is nothing between us! But I don't think Nishiwaki-kun would go out with somebody like Uchibori-san. You never know with men. Okay, I'm taking the picture for seniors in Class 7! What are you doing? More towards the center. Move that way some more. I'm fine over here. Just go over to Kouda! Say . . . What? Um . . . Are your feet okay? Yeah, because we took a break. I can't believe what you did. What do you mean? The class picture earlier. Did I do something? What? You were avoiding standing next to Kouda! That's not true. It was just bad timing. GHOST! Rika? Takako? Takako Kouda? That's me, but . . . I'm Junya . . . Sakaki Anna's younger brother. Oh . . . What? Why are you here anyways? Yeah, why? I'm camping with some friends nearby. They should be waiting for me somewhere ahead. Are you faking it? Don't tell me that you're the ghost from last year too. I'm not a ghost, but . . . Anna never said anything! I came secretly last year too. But when she found out, she got really mad! Give me back my photos! Do you know how many I bought because I thought you were a ghost?! You're just like Anna! She was the same way when she got mad. The supernatural photos were all of Sakaki Anna's brother. Never mind that, you were terrible! Huh? What did I do? You let Rika fall into the river! Don't you like her? I think she's cute in her own way. Then why? You were just lecturing me about avoiding Kouda . . . The timing . . . What's that supposed to mean? That's what I said! There are proper times and places for things in this world. With Goto Rika too? I don't get it. Yeah, well . . . Is the Walking Festival that interesting? Nope! Since Anna would always go on about the Festival . . . I wondered what was so special about it. Whether it's to celebrate youth or the group collective . . . When I told her it was boring, she got really mad at me and said . . . "A kid like you wouldn't understand." Then why did you come again? Because Anna's still raving about the Walking Festival. She made you feel sad? Siblings sure are complicated! That's not what I meant. But I think I kind of understand what Anna meant now. You should try walking from morning! Then you'd definitely not want to do it. Yeah, we're going to be walking until tomorrow morning! You wanna write something too, Takako? No thanks. Hey, who was this guy that Anna liked? She didn't tell me. Are you really her friend? Huh? Because she's the type that always talks, but never listens. What will you do if you find out? Give him a message? She'd kill me if I did! No, I just want to see what kind of guy he is. Is that all? Do you have any siblings, Takako? No. What about Miwako? A younger sister. Hmm . . . What? Well . . . Anna said that the guy she liked was the brother of a friend. When did she say that? Last year, I think . . . It's been awhile. I might have misheard it. What class is Miwako in? Class 3. What? I thought she was in class 7! This is Class 7, right? Class 3? I wonder if I can catch up to them now. I'm going to see if I can. See you later! Man, your bag is heavy! Can you still walk? Wow, look at all the stuff written here! Good job! Out of my way! Ghost! I'm Sakaki Anna's younger brother! Why are you here? If you'd just wait a second! Do your best~ Sensei! Are you putting your feet down properly? You look like you're about to fall over! Be careful! Pick up your legs more! Shut up . . . Night is when noisy kids like myself appear. I don't want to hear it. There's something I was too embarrassed to say when I thought I wouldn't make it . . . But I'll say it now! I know what I want to do! I've decided to be a radio disc jockey! I want to make sleepless kids like myself happy! Oh yeah? Huh? I thought you'd laugh at that. Good luck . . . Thank you, Sensei! Good luck to you too! We've gotten pretty far ahead, haven't we? Who's fault is that? The guy Anna liked? Say . . . Are there a lot of people who make love confessions during the Walking Festival? Not really. I wonder if Anna would have confessed if she were able to make it this year. I think the Walking Festival does have a power though. It has the power to make you say things you haven't been able to say before. Things you want to keep secret . . . Things you should keep secret . . . It really does have that power. Is it past midnight? Yeah. Yay! Party! They're like barbells! In order to get pumped up for this final Walking Festival . . . I went to sleep listening to the greatest rock'n roll song! It's not famous, but after awhile you'll hear sounds you've never heard before! And before you know it, all you hear is the chirping of the birds. Because you say things like that, people think you're a weirdo. Yay! Party! Takami! Your change! I won't be walking with you this year . . . a secret charm from last year . . . a solution to your problems . . . Hi, baby! Takako, Rika, Chiaki . . . Are you happy? Party! Ah, thanks! Thank you! Why? A birthday party! Let?s head over to Nishiwaki! Oh, it's for Nishiwaki-kun. Have fun. Let's go. Happy birthday. Thanks. It'll look great on you. I'm exhausted! I've washed it already. So if you'd like, you can use it now. Sorry! I like it a little sour. They have take-out for that tart too, you know. Yeah. Do you like it too? I knew it! But the portions are too big to finish alone, don't you think? - Yeah . . . - Right? Then it's perfect! We can go together. Huh? Great! It's a promise, right? The present is a towel? Nishiwaki-kun is going to be traumatized. Don't interfere. They look like they're having fun. No way . . . Not with somebody as destructive as that baby. Can I drink this? Just wait a little longer! Isn't it time you tell him how you feel? I think they look good together. I don't like seeing those two together. It's wrong! You really think so? I don't know why, but lately. I get irritated just looking at him. He's missing something! Underneath that glittering youth lies a dark shadow. In other words, I can't accept that he's so stiff and miserable. It's love! Love is what he's missing! Love? You're a passionate person, aren't you? Me? But I think he's caught now. No good. It has to be a love you fight for. Something you have push your way into. Uchibori-san won't do? Nope. But you could never know that unless you've been out with them, right? That's exactly how I know. You too? When? Hey, first year! Toda? Toda! What's wrong, Toda?! Toda! Leave it to me! Happy Birthday, Toru! Congratulations! You saved me, Takami! Thank you! Don't worry about it! Your happiness with Kouda is my happiness! Right now, I'm totally feeling thankful to the world! I'm thankful to my family and the night! I feel like Jesus! And so I want to do whatever I can to make EVERYBODY happy! I told you, just leave it to me! I'll show you the true beauty of the night! I promise! This is from Takami, to celebrate your birthday. Cheers! Cheers! Happy . . . Birthday. Thanks. Congratulations! You talked to him . . . So you've won your bet! But is that how you want it to end? Are you willing to accept things as they are now? This is cruel. I'm going to fall over. Seriously . . . We're just zombies! Why are you avoiding Kouda? Why do you want to know? The Group Walk is almost over. Now is the time. Don't blame it on timing. It doesn't matter what your position is. Here. You . . . She was a friend's girlfriend. She used to ask me for advice. But you know . . . I slowly began to realize something. I realized she wasn't meeting me to talk about her troubles. So you got her pregnant? Idiot! Of course not. That's what I meant by timing . . . If we had met under other circumstances things may have been different. But I stubbornly maintained my place as an advisor of my friend's girlfriend to the end. But . . . She couldn't accept that situation. And so we stopped meeting. But a few months later . . . She called me like she used to . . . And told me she'd had an abortion. I was at a loss. I can't help but think it happened because I avoided meeting her. In the end, you could say the timing was off. Or maybe it was my position? In any case, if I hadn't met her as my friend's girlfriend . . . Maybe . . . I'll run with you during the Free Walk. Eh? You'll run? I will. Okay. Takako . . . There really isn't anything between you and Nishiwaki-kun? Chiaki, that sounds like an order. You can still talk? I can't. But I've been waiting until dark to talk about this. There really isn't anything? I'm too tired to lie. Why are we walking? Rika? What about you? Because I'm walking? Chiaki too . . . And Takako as well. Huh? Rain? Just my imagination? Give me a break. But . . . It might rain . . . Last year, the stars were amazing, weren't they? Anna? What? You've cracked from exhaustion! Oh no! I'm so tired, I can't stop laughing! It's your fault, Anna! "Just walking . . ." "Wearing white track suits . . ." I can't believe you're walking without complaint! Back when we were freshmen! You came up with that anachronism! There's no way I'd walk this if I were by myself! No way! Everybody walking at night . . . That's it . . . Walking together . . . That's all it is . . . But how did it become so special? "60 km Mark 20 km Remaining" Good job! I don't believe it . . . Really . . . We take off again in two hours. Really . . . Unhappy? I want to cry but I'm so dehydrated, I can't. Look, look, look! I've walked this much! Let's see how many calories that is! Look, look, look! I've gotten a little thinner! Ouch! Ow . . . I'm going to look for Miwako. Good luck on the rest of the hike. You too. Good night. I'm sleepy! Stop! Don't throw these away here! Come back! Stupid brothers! Dammit! Miwako? What? Never mind . . . What is it? I'm going to sleep. Say . . . Did Ann's little brother ask you about siblings About siblings . . . Whether we had siblings or not Oh . . .. I told him I didn't But you do. You and Nishiwaki-kun . . . You're siblings. How . . . Did you know? Takako . . . How? What do you mean, "How"? How? It's almost 3 o'clock . . . 3 o'clock? My body . . . Won't move at all. Yeah. What do you want to do? Take off running or take it easy? Let's run. Then let's head to the front. We will now begin the 20 km Free Walk portion of the Walking Festival! I wish you luck in finishing the marathon safely and successfully! Here we go! Alright! Turn this way! How's your knee? Going downhill hurts more than going up. "You and Nishiwaki-kun are siblings." I can't go on. Then take the bus. I can't! Are you going to give up? You can't. Shoot! Your knee? Ankle . . . I was being too careful with the knee. I may have sprained it. You go on ahead. Shinobu . . . We wouldn't be able to see the scenery from this angle . . . If we weren't sitting here like this. Yeah. You really are stubborn. We stayed over at your place during last year's Golden Week, right? Yeah. It was then. It'll take about an hour. Passport? Of course I have it! Hold on . . . See? I've got it. Next Sunday? Okay. I'll see you later. Thank you! - I want a rare cheesecake! - Mont Blanc! Mont Blanc? Don't start the DVD without me! Okay! See you later! There's something I want to tell the both of you. I don't think it's something she would tell you herself . . . Takako . . . Is Nishiwaki Toru's half-sister. Takako probably feels guilty towards Nishiwaki-kun. It's my fault though, so there's absolutely no reason for her to feel that way . . . But she does. I'm sorry for telling you like this. But I wanted at least the two of you to know about her. Please take care of her. Thanks. - They're brother and sister? - You're kidding! With Nishiwaki-kun? Their father is the same? What does that mean? Takako is Nishiwaki-kun's sister? What does "half" mean? . . . It means they have different mothers! Half-sister? - Ah, I got it! - The mother is different! - No way! - I didn't know . . . I'm back! She's back! I'm back. Welcome back! You should have said something. That's right. You should have said something. Sorry. Nishiwaki Toru's pretty popular, isn't he? Are you jealous of Anna and Uchibori Ryoko? Why would I be jealous? I was jealous of you. What? Isn't it great to be Nishiwaki Toru's sister! Toda-kun doesn't know, does he? Nishiwaki Toru would never tell anybody about it. Are you going to graduate without talking to him? Entrance exams are coming up. And once we graduate, I don't think we'll ever meet again. But I'm okay with that. A solution to your problems . . . So you can successfully reach your goal. Anna . . . You have your whole future ahead of you after graduation. But it won't change the fact that you share the same blood with Nishiwaki Toru. Huh? What's wrong? He twisted his ankle. Are you okay? Oh, it's swelling! Yeah. Looks pretty painful. I'll carry your bag for you. That's okay, there really isn't anything in it anyways. If we take turns, it'll be easier. Right? Take off the bag. This might be your last chance! You really are persistent! They say I'm like glue. That pairing is pretty good too, don't you think? Why don't you join them? What about you? All you do is think about others! I'm fine. Your high school days are ending. That's okay. You're just like us! Maybe . . . Until now, I haven't been able to get the attention of the girl I like though. But you're doing a lot better than Nishiwaki-kun. Why don't you try harder? Where's the girl you like? Here. Just kidding! See, I'm the type that can say it to anybody. Hey! What do you mean by "anybody"? Thanks for carrying my bag. Don't worry about it. It really does help. Takako is the same. She'd rather keep things to herself than to burden others. You guys really are alike. You're too stiff. You don't ask for help when you need it. That can be a good thing, but it's lonely. Not being able to tell your troubles to your best friends or the girl you're thinking about. Takako! Miwako! Good morning! Huh? You're still here? Where did you camp? By the riverbed. Hi, I'm Sakaki Junya, Anna's younger brother! Do you know her? We know her. I remembered that the guy Anna liked is in the Tennis Club. Still not ringing any bells? Sorry. Takako? No good, huh? I asked some of the Tennis Club . . . But everybody I asked about Anna's friends all answered Takako and Miwako. Huh . . . Toru, you're in the Tennis Club. Do you know? You're in the Tennis Club? Yeah. Your name is Toru? Toru what? Nishiwaki. Nishiwaki . . . Toru . . . Toru Nishiwaki is in the Tennis Club? Do you have any siblings? He doesn't have any. What about somebody nobody knows about? You have a sibling that's one of Anna's friends, don't you? I was hesitant to ask anybody that, but . . . Really? It's Takako? So that's it! That's why you're walking together! I heard the situation was complicated . . . But I didn't know how to ask it. I had just about given up too! Um, I'll go back to my friends now . . . I didn't want to say. Why not? Because it's my family's embarrassment. Why? She's the result of an affair my Dad had. That's why you hated her? I never hated her . . . You made me look like an idiot! Sorry. I'm sorry too. I said some foolish things to Kouda. She's strong. She is . . . Just like you. I'm not strong. Although your mothers are different, you're still brother and sister. You're not lovers. You . . . That's not what I meant. You're always looking at her. You want to know her. You have somebody you share the same blood with. There's no use, I'm telling you. You two really are siblings! What are you going to do about it? The Walking Festival is almost over. Anyway, what hurts most is that I learned about this from Sakaki Anna's brother . . . instead of from you. Here's the checkpoint! Please give your names here! "73 km Mark 7 km Remaining" It'll be over soon. Just a little further now! Good luck! Third year. Third year, class three. Toda. Yusa. Huh? Hey, Takami! You're amazing! You were ahead of us? I don't know where you get your energy! I can't go on. It's almost dawn . . . I'll wait for the bus. I'll take that. See you. Are you okay? Huh? You were walking together? Huh? That's great! I was so worried! My first job is a success! I hope you'll be happy! He's still got the wrong idea! It's finally come for me, has it? - Are you alright? - I'm fine. - Are you sure? Good luck! - Thanks. Nishiwaki-kun! I'm so glad! I thought I wouldn't see you anymore. Look, I fell! But I feel better now. Where are your friends? That's okay. I wanted to walk with you from the beginning anyways. I'm glad! It would have been no fun to finish with them. I'm glad we can reach the end together! Let's go! We'll never get her claws out. Leave it all to me, Baby. Those who interfere with love . . . I'll show them! Takami-kun . . . Is so cool! Well, if it isn't the Madonna Ryoko-chan! Meeting you here like this is like the ultimate Jesus! I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight! Ryoko-chan! Come on, rock with me! The zombie has disappeared! And it's daytime, no less. Let's give him a hand, Toda-kun. Alright! Yay! Ryoko-chan! I wanna talk about rock too! Come on! I don't want to! I don't care about rock! Uchibori-san! Let's go! Sprained? Yeah. Are you injured anywhere else? You've been walking differently lately. Oh . . . My knee. I pushed too hard in tennis practice and injured it. You're wounded from head to toe. Oh no . . . I don't know how to write the kanji characters for that. You're good at kanji, aren't you? Weren't you 2nd in the class rankings for kanji? Is it painful to walk? It's pretty bad. Can we talk about something else? I made a bet with myself during this Walking Festival. Bet? There was somebody in my class that I wanted to speak to, even if it were just a single word. I'd been ignored by this person for all this time . . . And I thought that if I didn't do something, I would never be able to talk to them. But it didn't work. Even though I made a bet with myself, I couldn't talk like we are now. The morning of the Walking Festival, I started off listening to Machine Head. Highway Star, Smoke on the Water Live in Japan is good too, right? Oh! Ritchie Blackmore too! I know! I wanted to listen to it too! But my brother told me Krazy Kats were better. Really? He told me that for the Walking Festival I should listen to "something" Shinkyoku. Komasuri shinkyoku or Hondara shinkyoku? Yeah! Krazy is rock, right? The two of us . . . Do you hold a grudge about our relationship? What I despised was the position I was in and everything about it. That's why I wanted to grow up as soon as possible. But now I think I was jealous of your relationship with your mother. She's cool and you get along. Ah, I can't write the kanji for "jealous" either. I wonder if I'll be okay for the exams. I regret it. What? Not getting to know you when I was younger. But you're doing something about it now. Huh? Doesn't this feel incredibly memorable? As your last Walking Festival in high school draws to a close . . . You find yourself walking with the classmate you've always wanted to know, but never spoke to. A sibling by a different mother . . . How melodramatic! It's memorable! I wonder how it will be in real life . . . What lies in the future? Say . . . Someday, let's go walking again. 80 kilometers? Of course not! Someday . . . Someday. Huh? I . . . Can you not tell Anna about this? Oh! Anna's secret charm was you! Tell Anna that we found the secret charm. The secret charm from last year . . . Ah! I feel better now! I couldn't figure out what the secret charm was! Anna's secret charm? What the heck? a secret charm from last year will most likely be with you again. Wow! Anna knew everything! What do you think about this last hill? Makes you hate everything, doesn't it? Outta my way! The dog! Is gonna eat me!!! I'm gonna die! Help me! Come on, help me! Outta my way! If you're not gonna help, get outta the way! Alright . . . Shall we make our last memory of youth? Alright! Let's do it! What's with this burst of energy? These siblings are so irritating! Toda-kun! Shoelace! I won't be walking with you this year but a secret charm from last year will most likely be with you again. I pray for a solution to your problems . . . so that you can successfully reach your goal. Thank you. Both you and Anna . . . Thank you. Ready, set . . . Goal! ------ ====June 2007====------ ------ =Timing: jocutus=------ ---- =Translation: mizune=---- ------====July 2011====------ --US english grammar update: aio--
