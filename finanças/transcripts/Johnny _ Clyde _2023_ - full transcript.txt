I know. Trust me. I don't plan to be Nancy Drew, but I'm gonna blow this story wide the fuck open. Her father's company literally gets away with murder. And that is gonna change as long as you keep your balls and go ahead with my story. Yeah. Of course, I'm wearing the wire. Yeah. I'm at her office now. Wish me luck. It's a Carcano 91/38. This is the gun that killed Kennedy. I thought the actual rifle was on display at the Texas Book Depository. That would be a fake. And you have it, because... Please sit. I'm sorry if this comes off as rude, but I'm just fascinated. Can I ask you what does something like that even cost? It must be priceless. Well, I feel like you didn't come here for a history lesson. So, why don't we just skip all that, and you can hand me that wire that you're wearing. I'm not wearing a wire. Ah, come on. Is it in your bra? Did they hide it in your skirt? Okay. This is absurd. Well, here's the thing. This is gonna go a lot smoother if you don't treat me like I'm an idiot. Right? This casino generates billions of dollars. We have the top anti-intelligence equipment in the world. Your microphone was screaming frequencies from the second you parked your car. Can I have the wire now? It was in the bra. It's always in the bra. Great. Why are you here? One word. Bakwas. Well, that's a myth. Campfire stories. Well, what about all the missing people on or near casino property? Could it have anything to do with the undead slasher that's been stalking these lands for years? A slasher that you now control? I'm sorry. Did you just listen to the words that you said? Corporate slasher mind control? It's hilarious Scooby Doo shit. Who do you work for again? Is it National Enquirer? Daily Mail? Ms. Hart. This story is happening with or without your consent. You can give me your side of the story, or I can do it without you. Personally, I'd much rather get your take. What do you say? I say, how's 2 million? 2 million what? Dollars, of course. Wow. You really are full of surprises. This... is an NDA. All you have to do is sign on that line, and you walk out of here with life-changing money. You can't buy your way out of this one. I don't want your blood money. You don't? Are you sure? Positive. Okay. Well... I tried. Oh. - Hi. Yes, miss. Uh, yeah. I'm gonna need a clean-up crew and a body double.

Jerry. Well, J... J... J... Jerry, I'm p... p... perplexed why you think I'm going to Rhode Island. Oh, your... your plates, they say, "Rhode Island." Why would a man of such stature as yourself give a fine fuck if I'm coming or going to Rhode Island? Fuck off! We're closed! Now... I don't want to assume anything here, Jerry. But, um, you must have people coming and going all the time here. Do you ask every single one of those people where they're going? I didn't... I didn't... I didn't ask where. You're right! Goddammit! You're right. You didn't ask. You know why? 'Cause you already fucking knew. N... no. Your plates. You've got Rhode Island... P... p... p... p... plates. Wait. What was that? What? What was what? The gun. You just... you just looked at my gun. No. I didn't. Oh, I fucking hate that. Hate what? You just did it again. N... no, I... Pick it up. No. Pick it up. I'm not gonna ask you again! Pick it the fuck up! Ooh! Hey, Tex. Pull the trigger. Please just leave. Just leave. Just l... l... go. Jerry. Some men, they seek greatness while other men have greatness thrust upon them. Do you feel that, Jerry? That's greatness thrusting itself into your asshole. Now, pull the fucking trigger. Ooh! Oh. Jesus Christ, Jerry. - The safety's on. What, you think I'm some kind of reckless fuck? Huh? That's a loaded firearm. Gun safety is very important. Bye-bye now. Ooh! Sorry. I love these. You are one gorgeous bitch. You know, I love you. You ready to kick rocks, baby? Fuck you! My dad's a sheriff! He's gonna find you and fucking kill you! You're being selfish. Ooh, you sound scared! Do me a favor. Call up your daddy. Your face... Daddy! Daddy! It's okay. It's okay. And we are gonna get right on the scene. We have a breaking story developing right now. We're gonna cut right over to Jesse McPhee on the scene right now. Jesse. It is presently unknown why Johnny and Clyde have returned to the ocean state. Investigators can only speculate why after a year-long crime spree of murder and rampage, spanning the entirety of a nation. Police are baffled as to why the modern-day Bonnie and Clyde have chosen to come back to Rhode Island. We'll be actively following this case and reporting all the action as it develops. They're fuckin' back. Pick up, pick up. Come on. Come on. Told your ass not to run. You bail-jumpin' motherfucker. Fuckin' bitch. Hello. Hey, it's me. Oh, fuck, no, Lock. Uh-uh. Your credits are gone. You done used them shits up. Please, pal. You don't understand. Nah, man. You don't understand. You still owe me from the last time. You lost your badge and I lost my job, because of you. They're back. Shit. All right. What's the plan now? Oh, yes! My man! All right. I'll get back to you ASAP with the details. There ain't enough rocks around here for them to crawl under. But I'll find 'em. I will find them. All right. I got your back. You're a good man. Yeah. Yeah. Purrin' like a kitten. You are a remarkable woman. Tell me again how we first met. Oh, baby. I told you that story a thousand times. Let's talk about our present or our future. Tell me again! Well... when I turned 18, and I could finally leave that damn foster home, I went out. Saw a bit of the world. Realized it wasn't for me. If I wasn't gonna be famous, I was gonna be infamous. Well, my choice was obvious. Serial murder. And then I met you. And you were the first girl to make me feel special. So, I wanted to give you something special. A piece of my heart, you know? The knife I used on my first kill. And you promised you would keep it close to your heart... forever. Ooh! And then you told me about that mean, old daddy of yours. And how he used to hurt you. What did my dad say? Who cares? I just knew I had to take care of you. We'd be the darkest fairy tale of all time. What would that fairy tale be? Oh, you know, boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. Boy and girl fall desperately in love and kill as many people as humanly possible. And live together happily ever after in infamy. Johnny and Clyde forever. Okay. Good girl. Ah, fuck! You got my ear. Gee, goddammit! Again! - Oh, God! Baby, that's my ear. You fucking caught my ear! - Aw! Kisses. Better? Mm. Mmhmm. Oh. Ooh. Again. Again. Where do we stand? Support team will land at 0800. Oh my God. Just give me the fucking time, Guy. We're not on a naval ship. 8:00 a.m., miss. Great. Miss. Yes? - Um... Don't you think that... You know what I hate, Guy? Do you know what I fucking hate? Having to repeat myself. Just make it happen. Why are you like that? Why do you look like that? Are you nervous? No. Are you shaking? No. Are you scared? Of course, not. Okay. Honey Pot. Light up. Why are you still here? Why are you here? Forgive me, miss. Don't be such a baby! Fucking fun to do this. What the fuck is this? Hey, what's up, baby? You need some help? Hey. Hey! Hey, hey, hey. What? What the fuck? What are you doin'? Get back in the truck. We don't have time for this bullshit. Hey, sweetie! Not the plan, El Ma! Not the plan at all. But you said they both get out the car. I know, bubba. I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's okay. The plan was to kill one. And have the other one open the back for us, 'cause it's probably locked. - Yeah? - Oh! Let's see if the driver has some keys, okay? Okay. Okay. Go on. Any keys, baby? Nada, babe. Goddammit! Just a quick little... idea here. Hey, guys! So, I got a bomb right here. What the fuck? Is that a fuckin' bomb? Is that a fuckin' bomb? Now, you can either come out of the car or I can blow us to kingdom fucking hell. Oh, what the fuck? I'm serious. It's okay... Hey. No. It's gonna work. It's gonna work. It's gonna work. Come on. Okay? Look. Ooh! Jesus, fuck! Jesus, fuck! Jesus, fuck! Jesus, fuck! No, no, no, no. You, on your knees. On your knees, please. Please don't shoot him yet. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Okay, what have we got here? Just fixing your hair. Okay. Motherfucker, no, no, no! Motherfucker! What is it, baby? Fuck! Fuck! - You think this is funny? It's just the fucking day drop. Shoot this unlucky fucker. No. No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait! Don't... Don't you guys want money? Huh? Okay, yeah. - I... I can show you where all the fuckin' money in the world is. I'm listening. But uh, you better not fuck this up. It's gotta be some Einstein-level shit. Okay, okay. There is... a secret depository. It's called the cash room. It looks like a... like a... Like a regular office building. It just happens to house the largest stash of cash on the Eastern Seaboard. The casino transports everything there. Everything. Um, anything off the books, it goes there. - And the... and the... the funny thing is... It's... It's not even that secure. Okay. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Okay, that's... That was actually interesting. So, uh, we're actually in a bit of a compromising position here with all these dead bodies on the side of the road, so, uh... get a toothbrush. What? You get the arms, I get the legs. Just like we always do. Oh boy. Yes. There's a problem with truck 84. Well, I don't know what that means. So, you're gonna have to give me more clarity than that, Guy. Do they have to be here? You know Honey Pot go wherever I go. Truck 84 was ambushed. Failed robbery attempt. Two men dead, one missing. Truck 84 had a coin delivery. I don't think we're dealing with master criminals here. Okay. Well, what do you think we're dealing with? Last night, Johnny and Clyde were seen traveling up the interstate. Knocked over a gas station. Killed two men less than an hour from here. Little too coincidental for me. I think it's romantic, no? Love and blood lost on the open road. Two lunatics on a cross-country kill tour, leaving behind a wake of destroyed families and baffled lawmen, only to return home for a victory lap. Very romantic, miss. Mm. My team are all over it. No. Hey, get me my girl. Somebody, get me my girl. Yes, miss. This could get messy. Messy is good for this. Messy is the opposite of corporate Which means no one will suspect that we're behind it. You catch on quick, Guy. Guy. I've been thinking about Bakwas. You don't want him on this. No. But keep him close just in case. You have been a great audience. I have a very, very special item for you. Lot 609. Undoubtedly, the only one of its kind in the world, I'm offering to you tonight. Bidding will open at 500,000. 500,000 is the bid. 5 million. 5 million? Thank you. 5 million. 5 million going once, 5 million going twice. Oh. Daddy likes. 9 million! 9 million on the table. 9 million going once, 9 million going twice. 9 million. Sold to the gentleman. Congratulations, sir. Oh, come to Papa. This is just marvelous. Get me my stone. Get me my stone. I'll get you your fucking stone. Get it? Shit! You crazy? They have no magic! They're so ordinary. You're idiot. What did you say? Sorry, sorry I said that. I... Just... I know you're the boss. I listen to you, okay? Or maybe not! Fuck you. Wakey, wakey! Babe! Think you hit him too hard. Nah! He's all right. See. Can I try? Of course, El Ma. Give it a shot. She can fuckin' hit. Come on down here and hide. They're right over there. I want you to see them. Come on. Shh! Keep it quiet! What's the deal with the payment, Lock? I hate what this fucker did to you. But like I told you in there... - Yeah. - No more pro-bono. Yeah, I know. Here's 20 grand for now. Then you get to keep whatever we find on Johnny's dead body, all right, which should be a bundle. - All right. Well, you go yourself a desperado. Are we waiting until they come out and ice city, or we gonna bust in and light the motherfuckers up? No, no, no, no. We wait. We knock on the door, do something like that, it's gonna get all messy. So... all you have to do is tell me everything that you know about this place and then... Thank you, sweetheart. You get to go home, to the nice, happy family in the photograph. Okay? Look at me. Careful. If, uh... If you make one little mistake, forget to tell me something, or uh, make up some shit that gets me fucked, me and Clyde here are gonna go down to 85 Angel Briar and Cranston. We're going to introduce ourselves to the family. - Okay? Yes, yes, yes, yes. All right. So... here we go. Oh, oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, oh. Oh. Oh, no, no. That's disgusting, man. All I was gonna do is free your hands, so you could draw us a map. I fuckin' hate pee-ers. You always get the pee-ers. It's disgusting. Stop being so dramatic. You animal! Okay. So, what happens now is you are going to draw us a little map. With all little guards on it. Okay? If you do that, I'm gonna let you live. Okay. - That sound right? Y... yes. Okay. Go on. Go on! Okay. Okay. - Come on, Cliff boy! Come on! Okay, okay. Fuck! Oh. - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Go on then. There's, um... a safety deposit box. By the... the inside gate. There's two in the cash room. And one guy, he's... he's in... He's in charge. He just... he... walks around, just doing perimeter checks. That's a lot of guys. Yeah. That is a lot of guys, isn't it? Butcher, Baker, and the Candlestick maker? Uh-huh! All right. On three. One. Two... oh. Geez! Come on. - Come on. Move! Fuck! Shit! Funny, Johnny! Very funny! Hi, Lock! Come on, Johnny. Let's make this easy, huh? How about no prison? Yeah. Fuck that! What do you say, huh? You gonna die no matter what. Who the hell is that? Does it matter? They're fuckin' shooting at us! Get in, baby. Get him! Who the hell was that? I have no idea. What? I'm afraid, uh, bad news. It's... it's Zhang. Hey, darling. They have no clue. The stone was very close. Shall we engage? Mm? Mm. ♪ 'Cause you belong to me ♪ 'Cause we belong together Valhalla awaits. Oh, man! Oh, Johnny! Hey, little fella! Great to see you. Hey, Clyde. Howdy. So... whatcha up to? Been gambling a lot. Well, it's funny that you should say "gambling" because me and Clyde here, we're gonna rip off a casino. You want in? Do I get to kill people? Honey, I double-damn guarantee it. Oh, before I can commit, I need to ask you a very important question. Left or right? Huh? Just real quick. Left or right? Left. Okay. Okay, I'm in. Yay! - Oh, great! Uh, hey, big guy? Seen much of Baker these days? Oh, shit. You didn't hear. ♪ I would rather be a pencil than a pencil case ♪ ♪ I'd rather be a basket than a basketcase ♪ Oh. That's Baker. Whoo! No. This is so boring. Who is picking this shit out? Who is doing this to me? Because this is my free time. I don't have time for this shit. No. Go, change. Let's make it worth it. I don't know what the fuck you were so happy about. You should have known when you looked in the mirror that that wasn't it. Not a vibe. Next. Oh my God! Sweet Jesus! This is what I'm talking about. Look at this. Holy shit, yes! Mm. I love it. Uh, one second. Can you give us a minute? Did I say, leave? Or did I say, "Give us a minute"? Okay. Let's do it. Daddy? I have great news. Make it fast. Daddy's busy. Well, profits have never been better. And yes, we did hit a few hiccups along the way, but that is all smoothed out now. What did you do about Johnny and Clyde? Well, they're just zits waiting to be popped. Always something with you. Daddy, sir, um... I was thinking... I've been here for a few years. And I have turned this dusty, shit place into a world-class resort, and... maybe it's time that I could come home, you know? I really miss you. I miss Vegas. You made a mess. Now, clean it up. And then, and only then can you come home. I won't let you down. And Alana, darling? Yes, Daddy? I know everything. Of course, you do. No mistakes, right? Bye, Daddy. I love... oh. Get fucking dressed! What the fuck? Fucking work. I'm only the fucking person that works in this goddamn fucking bullshit. So... I think the word I'm looking for... is respect. Or really it's a lack thereof it. Now, one of you... has been stealing my newspaper. Now, I know it's been a long three days. And two of you did nothin'. Now, you... you think I don't know. Oh, but I do. Oh, I do. And if you don't answer me, all three of you get gutted. Now, can you please spare your pals and cop to what you did? Sir, please look at him! He's been dead for two days! So he is. But if this is some kind of trick, I will fucking gut you. You're not even on my route! I don't even think you're a subscriber. Shh! Well, no answer. Let's go. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. I think I hear some movement around there. - Oh, God! Son of a bitch. He's home. I told you, if I saw you again, I'd... I'd give you the biggest fricking hug. Oh, it's good to see you. - Oh, there she is. Holy shit! The whole gang's here. Baker, Butcher! - Now, what the hell in God's name y'all doin' out here? Well, we got a little job for you if you're interested. - It's a... - Hell, yeah, papito. I'm in. Yeah. Well, I didn't even get to tell you about... Well, fuck that shit, homes. I'm in. So, come on in. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hey! Whoa! You, uh... you got... No, no, no, no, no, no. They just left. They just left. No, no, no, no, amigo. Come on, please. Please. Come on. Come on. Oh, it's cool. What are we stealing? Who we killing? Hopefully, all of the above, chico. - Yes! Yes! Chico! Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Oh. Sheriff Lock. How nice to finally meet you in person. It's just Lock. You know I'm not sheriff anymore. I do. Miss, are you okay? I'm fine, Guy. I'm pretty sure Mr. Lock is gonna behave himself. Yeah, I'll be a good boy. We're good, Guy. Goodbye. Pick his ass up. You wanna sit down? Well? I'll be quick. Two years ago, Johnny and Clyde killed my kid. My, uh... daughter. Mmhmm. And then your wife left. And then you started drinking. A lot. Combination of that and obsession with your daughter's killer, abused some power, broke some rules, got booted from the police department. It's a painfully tragic, weirdly common tale of a wayward lawman. Point, please. Those two shitbums that killed my little girl are gonna hit your safe. Well, that would be awfully foolish, because we have the best security in the world. Oh, no. Not that safe. The one no one knows about. Yeah! That one. I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. I'm sure you do. Are you alone, Mr. Lock? Hmm! Maybe. Maybe not. What do you want? How about a team-up? I can handle this before it ever starts. Oh my God. That's super cute. You guys, he wants a job. No, no, no, no. I don't want anything from you. Just first dibs on doing Johnny and Clyde. That's my fee. Mm... okay. Oh, nice. I can get movin' on right away. - I'll get beatin' down on those two pieces of shit. - Guy. Guy. You have no idea just how miserable I'm gonna make their lives. What are you doing? Oh, come on. Come on. This is not necessary, is it? You don't have to... You don't... hey, hey, hey! Oh! Come on! Hey, fuck off! We don't use that kind of language around here. Well, suck my dick, motherfucker. How's that for... All right. Leavin'. I'm leavin'. Oh, shit. You got no fuckin' clue what you're dealing with. All right? I think we'll be fine. Fuck me. Don't touch me, pal. We'll escort him off the property. No. What you're gonna do is line all these little shits up and flush. Of course, miss. Guy. Call the Elder. I want Bakwas. In that casino just so happens to be on the same grounds where the Infernal Order of Light performed their mass suicide, bro, which means it's protected by the Bakwas. Okay, what the fuck is a Bakwas? What the fuck is the Infernal Order of Light? Yo! The Bakwas and the Infernal Order are the first fuckin' documented Satanists to land in America, bro. Uh-huh. And I love you, but this is just a bullshit ghost story to scare children, right? It's... it's, uh... Completely fuckin' true, yo! Okay. He's gotten a little crazier since the last time I saw him. The wig is new. What the fuck is he doing? I told y'all. Man, these cats were into some dark shit. There's more to the story? BUTCHER, BAKER AND CLYDE: Shh! All right. Fine. Fuck it. The pilgrims landed in Plymouth in 1620, seeking religious freedom. But in 1625, a different group came over, also seeking some religious freedom. Hmm. A Satanic cult. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Now, the colonies were fuckin' booming. Not knowing these crazy fuckin' Satanists were just a spittin' distance away. Well, the townspeople figured it out. And they formed a posse to rid the order from their lands. But The Infernal order knew the people were coming. So, you know what they did? They lined 'em up, and they burned 'em at the stake. They tried. Before they could... the entire cult... stood in a giant circle. And they all ceremoniously... slit their own throats. Oh. Wait. Why... why did the whole cult have to kill themselves? Suffering, pain, and hate! Blood... and the tears... of the fallen. It pooled, and it created a massive death. A god they worshipped. Their god of death. Before you see him, you can hear children... weeping. You know, like a... like a warning. Okay. I'll be taking me back to the nuthouse. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Shh, shh. He's just a little... He's just... He's just bein' fun, right? Shit's real, dude. I believe you. Me, too. - Yeah. Me fuckin' three, which is why I'm out. - All right. I'll live to blow shit up another day. You talkin' about cameras, armed guards, and fuckin' ghost killers runnin' around here, I might be the fuck crazy, but I'm not stupid. I'm... I'm done. No, no, no. Look. Baker, Baker, Baker, Baker, please, please, please. - I'm done. - Please, please, please, please. Brother, brother, brother. We need you. Trust me. None of us want to die. I kinda do! - Will you please shh, shh, shh. Baker, Baker. Look at me. This is so fuckin' stupid, bro. So, you said you hear little kids crying before he comes to kill you? It's enough to make you piss your pants, huh. Shh. Well, this is so fucking stupid, man. - But? And? - Fine, man. - Hey! This guy's... What the fuck is he doing now? You guys want some drugs? Whoo! Oh, you got pumped too good for you. Eat the cookie, homie. It is done. Bakwas will remain until all are dead. How long will Bakwas be in my control? Uh, Bakwas will obey and cannot leave casino grounds while you possess the stone. I feel I must warn you. Bakwas was our cult's most ferocious and glorious warrior. But over time, he has grown full of rage and has become erratic and unpredictable. Have you told any of your people that I have the stone? Of course, not. My order would excommunicate me if they knew I was talking to you and not your father. So, you're the only one who knows? It's our little secret. Mm, great. Two can keep a secret if one of you is dead. Good morning, miss. Everything is in place for today, miss. Wonderful. It's just... I... I just, uh... didn't see the stone. Okay. And why pray tell were you looking for the stone? I just wanted to ensure its safety. You just are very lucky that I'm in a good mood today. The stone is with me at all times. Of course. Please feel free. - Don't straighten up. It's all good. Uh, yes. Please feel free to find your way out. I just... - Mmhmm. So, here is the basic idea. There are three floors. We're gonna get in, we're gonna go to the basement, and we're gonna get the money, and then we're gonna come back out the way we came. That's it? - That's the fucking plan? Yeah! - It sounds great, John. Yeah. That's a horrible fuckin' plan. What... what about the guards? Oh, a few guards. One here, uh, here. Yeah. Couple of guards. And? And... w... what the fuck do you mean "and"? - We gotta kill 'em. Listen, Baker. Relax, man. I'm not taking this lightly. It just so happens, it's a very simple job. But just to clarify, here it goes. Clyde and I quietly take out the guards. And then Baker blows the doors. And that's when the guards come in. And then Candle is gonna crack the safe. Wait. Wait, wait. John. I don't know how to crack a safe. Oh, that's okay, buddy. We're gonna work it out. We're gonna work it out. - But I... - He's gonna do fine, isn't he? We get the money. And we live happily ever after. The fuckin' end. It's not remotely gonna go like that. And you know that. It's called, "positive manifestation", Baker. - You ain't never read The Secret? Oh, you gotta read it. It's so empowering. You gotta read it. Johnny, do y'all even have guns? I've seen one pistol this entire time. The fuck is so funny? Well, I don't know. Do we got guns, or you got guns? - Oh, yeah. Now, that'll do nicely. I love you, Johnny. Okay. We wait until they file in. And then we go... Coming through the service entrance, then we cut them off. I heard you the first time. - Yeah. - I got you. All right. All right. Ooh! This is my joy! Ah! ♪ We could be the future together ♪ Yeah. You hear that? Yeah, I can... - I feel it. Yeah. - All right. Yeah. It's fight time. Yeah. Let's go. ♪ We could be the future together ♪ ♪ Ridin' out No, no. I'm thinking we should leave. It's just... I only got room for one of you. Here. Come, get a towel. The problem is... I can't decide who's' gonna come, who's gonna stay. Uh, so, I think I'll let you guys decide. Wow. I always knew you were the strongest link. Good job, baby girl. Hi. Mm, yeah. I'm gonna be needing another pair. The last two you gave me... broke. Yeah, it's just that you got me blonde last time. I don't... okay, yeah. Surprise me. Great. I'll let you know where to ship them when I land. Okay. Just as we planned. Honey, I'm gonna need you to go over there and strut ass as a distraction. I'm sorry, it's very disrespectful. I apologize. It's for the money. That's right, baby. Where's Candle? See, a fuckin' liability. Oh, stop. He's fun. Hey, John! I got the first two. All clear, buddy! Yeah, you did. - Okay, Baker. You're up. Okay. Blow this shit up. All right. Let me just take a look. Steel door hinges. Now, that's cute. Nothing I can't get through, though. Hey, I put together a little combo. A little, uh, gasoline, black powder mix. Should definitely do the trick. Ah, fuse is too long. Yeah, you might wanna back up at least 20 feet. And cover your ears. Hey, Baker. - You think that wick might be a little too short? - Mmhmm. Johnny. I've been doing this for a while. Of course, the wick is long enough. Okay. Babe. This doesn't look anything like your map. You know, I can't draw, baby. Drop it! Everybody's dying today. Fuck, yeah! - Hey, Butcher. - Tell me that's your fucking girlfriend behind us right there. Security lockdown enforced. Hiya, folks! Eyes up here, please. Sorry, you... You're interrupting. Who the fuck are you? The biggest mistake of your little shitty life, John. - That's kinda hurtful. - Mmhmm. I feel like that's kinda hurtful. Some of you came here for money. Some of you came here for glory. And some of you came here for revenge. But now, you're all trapped. You're all dead by sunrise. Yay! Now, because I'm a good sport and I wanna see an even playing field, I'm gonna let you know that the bottom floor is what you want. There's more money there than you will ever see in all of your combined lifetimes. If you can get to it, it's all yours. Great! Thank you. That sounds easy enough. Well, you might not feel that way after you meet our surprise guest. Everybody, meet Bakwas. Oh, shit. He's... Fucking... Real? All right, guys. Let's kick rocks, kids! You're a dead man, Johnny! Shoot him! Shoot him again! Blow its fuckin' head up! Headshot! Head! One Time! Goodbye. Stay away the hell, motherfucker! Go, go, go, go, go. Go, go. Ah. Thanks, El Ma. Hey guys, go, go. I got you. First floor, blue team. Targets are close. Soften them up. Copy that. Last seen in corridor C. We're at the last point of entry, sir. Okay. I'm up. - Uh-huh. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Let the boy do his thing. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, guys. Well, what are you waitin' for? Oh! Look at me, you son of a bitch. Hey, guys. We're good. Really great work, buddy. Yeah, wow. Butcher, I love you, too. I love you, too, man. Kill the scums. Okay, wow. All right. Gunfire. I got you. We got a gunfight. Ah, come on, you fuckers. I'm open to suggestions if anyone has any. You got a grenade? Nope. Oh, John, look. Holy shit. That guy's fuckin' sick. Wait, guys. Let's fuckin' go! Sick. Okay, let's go. Oh, shit. Guy. Miss. Thank God you're okay. Well, Guy. I can hear that you're out of breath. And I don't like that. Are you fucking this up? It's Bakwas. He's killing everyone including our own men. This isn't the way it was supposed to go down. I'm beginning to be very concerned for my own safety. Yes. Of course, you're scared. There's a mythical demonic slasher chasing you around, you should be. Miss. I'm afraid abandoning my post is my only chance of survival. I mean, you can try. You'll just never make it out. It's not you, Guy. It's me. Is that what you needed to hear? I sent Bakwas in to clean all of this up with no witnesses. And sadly... you're kind of a witness. After all I've done for you over the years? You ungrateful bitch! Guy. Die with some dignity, would ya? You have done a wonderful job. I just don't need you anymore. This isn't over. I promise you that. - One, two... - One, two, three! - Whoo! Come on, bitch! Candle, cover! Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Fuck! Oh, shit! Hey, hey. Butcher. Leave one alive. Candle, cover me! I got you, go! It's okay. It's okay. You killed my girlfriend. That's the only girl I ever loved. And the only girl who'll ever love me. So... What the fuck? I'm gonna make you pay for that. I got a question for you. Hands or feet? Nah. I'll answer that question for ya. Shut the fuck up. El Ma. I thought you... I thought you were dead. - I swear to God you died. Well, uh, you saved my life. I didn't know what I was gonna do without you. Aw! I love you, Johnny. I love you, man. Soldiers Men, if you are still alive, flee. All is lost. If you see Bakwas, run. Or this place will be your tomb. This is team leader signing off. May God help you. Because no one else will. The money! Hey, Johnny. I'm gonna donate my portion to the abused animals uh, foundation. That's so good. - What? Well, I haven't felt that one. What's that, little guy? Fear. I got you. Can y'all stop fuckin' around? It's a little slippery back here. What? The motherfucker's behind me, right? Go, go, go! Let's go! Candle! No! - Hey, what are you doing? - Goodbye, my love. Come on, Butcher. Let's go. Oh, come on. It's my time! - We're rich! Let's kick rocks! Let's go! Okay. That should hold him for a minute at least. Fuck. No. Come on, man. You're fucking coming with us. No, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny. I don't like the world very much, I never have. I'm just killin' time. When you guys came over, I was about to fucking kill myself out of shit fucking boredom. You gave me a purpose. Fucking quest! It was never about the money. It's about one last adventure with my friends. And you gave me that. Thanks. You're welcome, man. Don't be sad. 'Cause tonight, I dine in Valhalla. Fuck! Go! Just go! And Johnny. Try not to be such an asshole. I'll try my best. I'll see you in Valhalla. Go. Clyde, take care of him. Okay. - Let's go. There's always somebody better. You going easy on me? I think my time here is done, Father. Everything is wrapped up and delivered as promised. Of course. That was all removed before those two clowns got here. I took all the real money. All that's left is the counterfeit cash to buy us some time. ♪ Oh my God, you're delicious ♪ Paris, Monte Carlo yum, yum, yum, yum, yum ♪ See you in Vegas. So, you're just not gonna kill us? I worked for Alana's father. Cool. Who the fuck's Alana? You don't remember? On big screen, the lady who was telling you you're gonna die. Oh, yeah. I hated her. She was so rude. Yeah. What's that crazy bitch's dad gotta do with us? Shut the fuck up, bitch! He was watching you two for a while. He was impressed, but not me. There's no magic. Only ordinary. If not for him, you'd both be dead. Motherfucker, come this way! Go, go, go! Hey, baby. Baby, I think she just called you "ordinary". Am I ordinary? Come on, hurry! From now on, your fuckin' fate is connected to... Fuck! Fuckin'... You maggot motherfucker! - Fuck! You killed my little girl! Piece of shit! I killed a lot of people. Red-leather-pant-wearing motherfucker! Don't you... Don't you ever wonder why your dad never called? Because he didn't care. No. It's not because he didn't care. It's because he's dead. Johnny killed him. Johnny killed your dad. He had his pal clean up his mess. Hey, Butcher. Thank God you picked up. Hey, listen. Uh, I'm gonna need a little clean-up job. You're gonna want to bring some bleach. And some tarps. Put it all together. You're smart. Clyde, give me the gun. Come on, honey. Give me the gun. Thanks, baby. He was really fuckin' me up. Did you... did you really kill my dad? Yeah. Sorry about that. Hey. That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever done for me. No time for love, Dr. Jones. Oh, fuck. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. He can't fuckin' move. He's reached the, uh... cult city limits or some shit. - Johnny, we gotta go. - No, look at him. He can't move. We beat you! You Grim-Reaper-lookin' motherfucker with your fuckin' poncho! You crusty-ass bitch! - You dried-up piece of shit! You know, it's funny how life turns out sometimes. Yeah. I met Murder on the way. He had a mask like Castlereagh. Very smooth he looked, yet grim. Seven bloodhounds followed him. One by one and two by two... he then tossed them human hearts to chew. And then Anarchy rode and came on a white horse, splashed with blood. Very pale. He was very pale. Like death in the apocalypse. Guy, you survived. How wonderful! I always had faith that you would persevere. The stone. Give it to me! Oh, is that all you want? Here. Ah! - There's someone else who wants to see you. I, uh... You know who. Bakwas works for me. He does what I say. And I say, to kill him. I have the stone. You don't control him anymore. Oh, fuck you. I said to kill Guy now! Things will be different when I am in charge.
