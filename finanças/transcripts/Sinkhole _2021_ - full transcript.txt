The industrial complex has been gone for a long time. When I was little, my dad's car was dumped there. The car waste plant has been gone for a long time. Now there is an eco-friendly community. Isn't there a noisy subway in Changshou-dong? How can I hear the sound of the subway? Then how can a new building be built now? Also the wall is surrounded by two or three layers. Even if there is a war, we can't hear anything. Is this your house? No, no! Watch the ball roll. The ball just rolls on the floor.

Can't you just give me some money? - It will be engraved with your name. - Just give me the money I have something I want and am a little short on money. What is this chair? Company colleagues bought me this as a present. Isn't it expensive? How do I know I'm the one whose tired, why are you the one on the expensive chair? It's common chair, common. Dad I also want to try just go play. No. Just let him try it. Isn't it common property which whole family can use? My wife want to sit on it too. Then you just sleep in that rocking chair. Sleep forever! Let's go. Why is this happening? What is wrong? It's not like getting hit by a rock. Could it break by itself? Mister. I didn't do it. Who else if not you? Damn, it's really not me! Fix it as soon as possible. Or do you want me to call the Police? - Ah! - What do you mean police? Why are you looking like that? Alright, then work hard okay. - First, I'll take care of it... - I don't have to help you. Yes yes. It's a newly built 5 storey residential building. Of course the municipal council should take care of unsafe development. Is there any visible damage? So the residents should have a meeting first... and must all residents agree? This building where we live in. Maintenance service is not good. Frankly I want to tell you all is that something is wrong now. What's wrong with the house? First of all the windows start to get stuck. And it's not good. This proves that our house is tilted. - Damn the tilted house again! - Our house is tilted? If it is reported that our house is like this, it will cause house prices to fall. - That's right. - But my window is stuck too. How about house 202? Is it alright? Ah... I'm at the store more often, so I'm rarely at home. How about number 502? How is it? I just always smell of smoke from below. And the windows of our house have long been closed I'm not so sure either. Maybe from house number 401? No one smokes in my house. If its not you who else then? Look at your dry face. Isn't it like a bamboo pole? Ahh damn, what a bastard is this woman?! I've quit smoking for over 10 years. What smell of smoke? Okay. Try to smell this. There is a smell of smoke! - What? - He smells of cigarettes. Don't fight, please don't fight! You two are like husband and wife. You are sinners. Everyone, stop arguing, stop arguing. No, they suspect me. I hate being suspected! Ahh, I want to die. Dad, next month. Will send you to Civil Servant school. Do not worry. But dad has no money. Hey, dad has distributed flyers. Worked in call center. If you smoke. Go up to the top floor and smoke. The occupant of our upper house said the smell of smoke, they said. They can smell the smoke. I don't smoke. Right, you don't smoke, do you? Look, I'm going to go to tell her... I have to give a 502 tenant a lesson... Hey Seung-tae. Daddy won't say, eat, eat. Let's eat. Come out. - Take the gifts - Okay. The environment is quite clean, right? Let's go! Calm and it's suitable for kids. It's very quiet here. What is this? The old woman who lives in 301 keeps threatening me to death. It's the plastic used to make winter Kimchi. That's pretty good in my opinion. It's definitely not glass. Of course! I know that. This is not real glass. You are so stiff. I haven't seen winter kimchi in a long time. They came here for house warming right? Hello, we are all co-workers of Chief Park. Ah, apparently you are a Chief thank you hey no. 501, wait a minute! I found some flaws. Look at this! It's in that back parking lot I think it has a crack. This is the entrance to the parking lot. You saw it right, the big crack. You have to take a closer look to find them! Our house is really a mess. There's more here. Are you saying this is the current situation? Current situation!! This is not only a current problem but a future problem too. This is amazing. Look over there! There are more. Alright now!! Take a look at this. It's everywhere here. This is... Come see.

Why, thank you. - You bought a lot. - Thank you. - Yes. - Thank you. Hello. Su-Chan! Welcome, come in! The house is very spacious. - It smells great. - It's not that much though. Hello. How much does this house cost? Um... 3 Billion. Gosh... Amazing! What's amazing? That! Isn't it very similar to Mount Everest? The mountain you see but you can't visit. Even if you win the jackpot, you won't be able to go there. Who doesn't understand Apartments? Don't you understand the market? I wouldn't buy it if I couldn't afford it. You have to find money by taking a loan. Then you can buy an apartment. Manager Jung bought an apartment for 450 million earlier this year. Hey don't say that. House prices increased by 200 million in 6 months 200 million?? Yes!! Wow up 200 million. Up 200 million. That much... Eun-Joo?! Its not polite to leave the table until you're done drinking. Come here sit down again. I want to drink alone. Suddenly? Yes! Eun-Joo, your glass is empty. Manager Kim! Please pour some for Eun-Joo. Where are you going? Toilet!

It could take a long time. Please evacuate the citizens immediately and check the situation of the victims. Yes I understand! Damn it!! It's done... It worked. Su-Chan?!! We're here! I saw it I saw it... Su-Chan? Who are you? I saw it. When I'm standing at the door at 502. Su-Chan then left the house I saw him take the elevator. Then I went to the rooftop. This incident happened in just a few minutes. Su-Chan must be fine. He will be fine thank you my god. Ah ah. It hurts. Do not do it! Seung-Tae? My child? Seung-Tae Seung-Tae! Where did Seung-Tae go? - Who is Seung-Tae? - Seung-Tae! Seung-Tae!! Seung-Tae. This way! Seung-Tae Seung-Tae Seung-Tae. - Where are you? - Seung-Tae!! Seung-Tae. Shoes! Shoes! Shoes!! Shoes!! Shoes? Shoes!! Shoes? Whose shoes? Look at the shoes! Shoes. Shoes aren't here! Shoes! What shoes do you mean? My Seung-Tae's shoes. Not in the shoe closet right now. That means he went to the internet cafe Seung-Tae goes to the internet cafe?? Means he's fine. It looks like one of that... Sinkhole. My estimate is we're around 500 meters down. Is it because of an earthquake or the war? I'm certain... It's a sinkhole. Eun-Joo, where are you going? Going to the top of the building, maybe you can get a signal there. Or maybe you'll face death. Let's go together! Ahh... I won't go. It's too dangerous. Didn't you say the yellow light means go on? This is a red light. Gotta stop. The foundation is unstable, you have to be careful. Danger! Avalanche! Everyone, quickly pull it quickly!!! Quickly! you are in danger! Climb!! Be Careful, It's dangerous. Don't... don't go through there. It's... Dangerous there. Why did you come? - I... - Okay, you stay here! Thank you. Eun-Joo, you got a signal? No! - Keep looking! - Yes. There must be a place with a signal. Have you ever seen anything like that? I've seen something like that. When? At 9 years old... I once fell into a well. Well? Yes! I crawled out by myself. Maybe with this too. Help! - There's people down here. - Help! Help! - Hello!! - Is there anyone? There are people here. Help!! Please save us!! Help!! Ouch... That's why I told you... To go home. Costs 80,000 but didn't want to go. What do you mean? Last night you know. I want to use my car to take you and that woman home. Go to Anyang first then to Cheongun. It would be 90,000 then 80,000, Didn't I tell you? Still says it's too expensive. Didn't even wanted to go. I did that? No, It was your chief Mr. Park. Me? You don't remember? You were so drunk. Eighty thousand??? Isn't that what you said? Did I say that Eun-Joo? Yes. Damn it! Shut up, shut up! - There are people here. - His voice seems familiar. Hello. Help. - Hey. - Hey, isn't that Seung-Tae? - Seung-Tae? - Hello? - Seung-Tae? - Dad!! I'm here. Wait Seung-Tae. What is this? Was there an earthquake? Sinkhole. - Sinkhole? - Yes. Didn't you go to the internet cafe? I've stopped going there. Then what were you doing on the roof? Getting some air. Why didn't you go to the cafe? Didn't dad tell me not to go? What's the matter... That you didn't go to the internet cafe. Why not go... Are you hurt? My son? Are you hurt? Oh damn. Then let's think about what we should plan next. We are now in a disaster. First of all, we have to collect supplies to survive. Drinking water, food. Drugs. And a clean bed. And we have to let the outside know that we're still alive. We have to stand here and count one by one. If we find movement above. We send a signal with a flashlight. How can you understand a situation like this? I learned from Brother Chris on YouTube. Really weird. What is it? He shouldn't know any brother. I don't think he goes to the internet cafe all day. He's at home and just surfing the internet. Maybe a foreign friend. He can't speak English, where are foreign friends from? We better find a way out. It is currently very dangerous near the scene. It's hard for us to verify the situation inside the sinkhole. But later after evacuating the citizens. We will try to enter the sinkhole. Please everyone trust us. Please be patient waiting. Please take care of it sir. OK we will try our best. Then let's check the list of family members buried in the ground. Please say one by one Lee Seung-Hoon is 10 years old. This is No. 202 Park Dong-Won is 37 years old... I'm sorry Mr. Kim. Eun-Joo too, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you to come to the house warming. I never thought I would die in your house ever in my life. What's wrong with you thinking about dying? I have struggled for 11 years to buy this house and it became like this in just 2 weeks. Even I don't want to die, So don't even think about dying I really didn't want to think. But there's these images of death in my mind. You should think about Hyo-Jeong. You like that, don't you? What's the point of liking her? Isn't she currently dating Jung? It's not like they're getting married. Better to just confess if you come out later. Didn't you also hear that Mr. Jung had bought an apartment? While I live in one room. Really incomparable. Hey, can't you also buy an apartment? Didn't everyone say it was valued at 200 million? I really don't want to repeat I... I'm really thinking of dying!! I also live in one room. So who lives in one room can't get married? One room can be two rooms. Two rooms can also be three rooms. Of course, Eun-Joo is right. Look at me, I used to live in one room. Isn't it three rooms now? Didn't you say you've been fighting for 11 years? 11 yearsâ€¦! In addition to the 3 rooms, you now... Hey Seung-Tae Seung-Tae. What are you doing? I'm looking for something. Let's get out soon, something's falling. Quickly! Okay I'll come. Damn it! Damn, look at this. What is this. EVACUATION BUS FOR THE VICTIMS' FAMILY Why didn't the Rescue Team people come? Can't believe a day has passed. Not even one has shown up yet. They should know that we are still alive. Of course they know. Please calm down and be patient waiting. Discard the expired. Does it matter now about the expiration date? Mr. Kim, you are so sensitive. I will have diarrhea if I eat expired food. Around 10:50 this morning in Changsin-dong, of Seoul. The phenomenon of underlying caves collapse, Namely a sinkhole occurred. So far, the accident has caused a building to collapse to the bottom of the sinkhole. The cause of the incident was the subsidence of the foundation. Thus causing ground shear. The newly completed building, collapsed. We are currently investigating the disaster 32 people were slightly injured 7 seriously injured. The injured are currently being taken to 11 hospitals including Yonsei University Hospital... What I'm afraid of down there is what if they can't eat anything. What's this? Roast turkey! Let's eat. Hey number 501, wait a minute. Eat! Eat. Here you go number 501. Eat. Let's eat. Isn't that the new rocking chair that you bought? Yes. I always thought I should buy good furniture when I have my own house. To not use the type of furniture that is damaged by moving around. I've always wanted a piece of furniture that can be passed on to my children. You can buy it again later. But now I have no home. The rain doesn't stop. It keeps raining. Hey, don't worry. Wait a little longer 119 is coming. Mr. Kim is not married yet, right? Yes. Don't do it. I can't get married. I don't have a house. And have no future. Mr. Park, I envied you when you bought a house. Did you buy it? You bought this house? Yes. What is the price? 390 million. It didn't take that long to go up. How much did you buy yours for? I only rent. Deposit 30 million and rent 800,000 per month. Oh it's so cold. Where is firewood? Ah there is a lot of firewood here. Hey you guys, let's pull the wood out. There's a lot of firewood here. Come on. Use this broken chair, let me destroy it. To be used as firewood. Come on, quickly. Oh so much. Why is this so strong? Why can't I destroy it? What is wrong with it? Maybe the signal is weak. This is a big problem Dad! 119 here. Daddy 119 119 here 119? Hey 119 is here 119. Come out fast. Team 119 119 is here 119 Where's 119? Here! Here. Where? Where? Where? Where? Is this 119? It says 119 on it 119 119 We are saved! Saved!! It fell from above. The signal in this place must be relatively weak. Can't be perfect. Ahh isn't there a big hole up there. Why is there no signal? When we are in tunnels and mountains, sometimes there is no signal. We are at 250 meters from the ground above. Of course there will be no signal. Can the camera still be used? Everyone, help us. We're stuck here. My name is Kim Seung-Hyeon. - Come help us - Help me! We're hereâ€¦ Is that yours? You don't need to know. Why so much money? Watch out!! Go there. Quick. Come here quickly! Go there. Over here. Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim! Help me. Where? Mr. Kim! Don't go, don't... Eun-Ju, don't go... Eun-Joo, don't dodge the rocks! Catch!! Mr. Park please help me pull the rope!! Mister! Help me.

Dad, Dad. Follow me!! Brother!! Seung-Tae!! Are you alright? Wake up!! Get up!! Seung-Tae, are you okay? Wake up!! Seung-Tae Seung-Tae where is he? Seung-Tae... Seung-Tae wake up, Seung-Tae wake up!! Seung-Tae wake up! Are you all right? Seung-Tae!! Seung-Tae wake up! Are you okay? We are temporarily securing the building with chains. But the probability of collapsing is still very high. Isn't that our drone? Let's get it! He's an employee of my husband's company Hong Eun-Joo, Kim Seong-Hoon. Why is my Seong-hun not there? That is it. How about my Seong-Hoon? I'm sorry. This is all we have Seung-Hoon... No!! Mr. Seo. My husband and Su-Chan don't seem to be together. Please look for them. You said Su-Chan was holding your phone, right? Yes. What are people living for? I'm just busy with the shop. Can't even give my Seong-Hoon... Hot food every day. What's my life for? If Seung-Hoon can be saved, I will close the shop and will always be by his side. I have to do that. We've tracked the phone's location. Su-Chan's phone... The last location was... at the residency building. How could this happen? How could that be? Good grief. Butâ€¦ This sinkhole disaster still has its benefits. What? It's rare to see Seung-Tae sleeping at my house like that. Thank you 501. I will repay for this in the future. At least you should come out alive to repay later 119 sending drones explains what? They know what's going on. They know we're stuck here without nothing. By the way, are the people living in this building all right? Do not worry I've been around in the morning. Maybe due to lack of water. There's was no one at any home. Really? That's really good. I was worried about them. Is that your mother? Eun-Joo, did you have any difficulties at the company? Let me know if any. Is that so? Doesn't the company send gifts home during the holidays? I want to send it to my parents I've never sent them to this day. I will try... Do you want to listen to music or take a selfie? Let's take a selfie. This news just in. It has been confirmed that there are survivors in the sinkhole. Meanwhile the local rescue operation confirmed that there were more survivors. Also doing their best to seek and save. But there is danger of a next possible collapse. And it is expected that there will be heavy rain tonight. Will increase the difficulty of search and rescue. Now we know there are survivors in the sinkhole. But if another standing building comes crashing down. Then something big will happen. How can you say that? Who would agree to blow up a nice building? Again, we won't blow it up. The concrete collapse below. It then moves the center of gravity in the opposite direction from the sinkhole. If we don't do this, your homes will all sink into the sinkhole. Do you want to save only them? How about us? We have to live too. Is it right?? Of course. If we continue like this. We will never reach an agreement. Right? Of course I don't agree. Do not agreeâ€¦ There is no way to agree. Let me say something. I saw someone on the roof of that building. He was looking at me all throughout when it happened. When I looked at him I was going crazy. It took me 20 years to buy this house. But... if now I don't agree. I will definitely be cursed. I agree sir. Are the satellite phones and rescue items ready? We're still looking for a parachute It takes time sir. Hey, it's going to rain soon. Be quick. Yes sir!! Lower. Take it, son, isn't this yours? Can't even go to school. Although earn so much without buying books. Take it. Hey Seung-Tae. Can I ask me something? Yes. What are you saving that money for? My dream is to have a hundred million won. Your dream? 100 million won? Yes. If you got it? What do you want to do next? I do not know. Ahh this kid. So boring oh my god. Hey Seung-Tae look at that. That dream... is like that star. Very far away. Dad, it seems to be getting closer. What do you mean close? Are you drunk right now? What's this? What's this? Is it a shooting star? We are saved, we are saved. It is now clear that 119 is coming soon thank you Lord. Ahh the water is so sweet. What's this? Isn't this a satellite phone? There's a signal. Can we call? Mom!! Mom. Why wasn't that my mom? How come. Not your mother? It was a man speaking. Eun-Joo, try calling home. It's alright. They will worry even more if I call now. Can make them sadder I'll go up and meet them directly. Seo-Jeon. Um, It's me Manager Kim and Eun-Joo, we're doing well. Thank you for worrying about me. Seo-Jeon, I want to tell you something. We have that gift event for Chuseok next month.
