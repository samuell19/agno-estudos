FULL RIVER RED Stop staring at us. We were all on duty last night. Let fate decide. Those with short straws stand here. Sir, I have a long one. Go. It is an odd day today. Let's start with long ones. Is it an odd day today? An odd day? How so? -Not me. Mine is not the longest. Mine is not the longest. He has a long one. Mine is not the longest. His is longer than mine. Don't kill me. Mine is not the longest. Mine is not. Mine is short. Short. Theirs are longer. Mine is short. Short. Short. Zhang Da, Are you the killer? Uncle, It is me, your nephew. Are you the killer? I know nothing. How can I be the killer? Do you recognize this? I do. I do. I do. It is... Stop. I do not want to hear it. A new broom sweeps clean. You swept here. I am taking the suspect to see the prime minister. Apart from the two deaf and mute maids, I decide who can see the prime minister. Kid, no matter how capable you are, you have to obey the rules. Give him to me. I will not see the prime minister then. Let's go. An exception can be made. Lord He. Lord Wu. Commander Wang. Please let Deputy Commander Sun in. It is just... Don't you understand Lord He's words? Take off your armor. Open your mouth. Clean. He is clean. He can come up. He can come up. The suspect can stay. Others should wait outside. Leave, Lord Wu. Wait at the door, Deputy Commander Sun. Zhang Da stays. What's this for? It is... This IS for carrying letters. It is a leather bag for carrying letters. How do you know? I was born in a border area. That year when I was herding sheep, in the sand Hurry up. Get to the point. In the sand appeared 8 Jin soldiers. They took me to their kingdom. They noticed I can run, and gave me a job to deliver letters. So, I have seen this item before. Your Excellency, I am loyal to Song. How could I do things for Jin? I seized an opportunity, and escaped to Song. After I was back, I joined the army and worked for the prime minister. Which level of secrecy a letter is if it is enclosed in such a bag? Very high level. A normal letter does not need a bag. A general would use a cloth bag. A commander would use a leather bag. Your Excellency might not know that this leather is made from two-year old cattle. Why two-year old? Tender. Resilient. Cut the crap. What's your name? Your Excellency, my name is Zhang Da. You have a glib tongue, and seems to be clever. I will give you two hours. Bring the secret letter from Jin to me. Zhang Da, with this pass, you can go anywhere, and investigate anyone in this courtyard. Don't let others know what you are looking for. If you bring the letter, I will let you live. Go. Do you understand? I probably do. After you were taken by the Jin army, you escaped. After many hardships, you returned to Song. With your talents, you were back in high positions. However, your loyalty has been doubted by small men. Small men? That is a polite way of putting it. Some high-ranking officials are among them. Even, the emperor, might doubt it as well. The Jin diplomat was about to see you this morning. Whatever he brought with him, he did have the chance to give it to you. If there were any... Right. If there were a secret letter for you, it cannot be seen by anyone else. Even the existence of such a letter, cannot be known to anyone else. You are getting better at this. Keep an eye on Zhang Da. There are two hours before we go to the ferry, When the time is up, if he cannot get the letter, kill him. I see. What if he gets the letter? Kill him as well. I see. Sun Jun, the newly promoted commander, seems to be smart. Bring him here. This pass has never been used. You are gambling with your life. Tell me. Where are we going? I made up things up in front of the prime minister. I did not do it. How can I know where to go? I will kill you. You kill me? I must remind you that your parents died when you were little, my mother raised you. You are repaying her with this? You are a black sheep. How dare you mention my sister? How dare you? If you mention her again, trust me, I will break your legs. I trust you. I helped her raise you. I have only one request. Don't always kick me on the same spot. Try to stay alive. Don't waste your time. Let me think. Let me think. At night, there was a banquet for the Jin diplomat. The local officials sent three dancers to entertain him. There are guards at the door. Guards patrolled in pairs. There was no chance for an assassin. The lead dancer. Only she entered the Jin diplomat's room. Am I right? What do you take us for? We have questioned them. No leads. Question them again. Handsome, drink with me. Have a good time and let us go. Get away from me. How dare you jerks pick on me? I have finished my business here. Why don't you let me go? Very nice. Woman, what's your name? Zither. The Jin man died. Do you know? Which Jin man? The one I entertained tonight? Died? You did not tell me so. You are responsible for it. What's wrong with you? You are not doing me justice. He was alive when I left. He even walked me to the door. All soldiers on patrol saw it. I am innocent, my lord. That night how many times did you do it with him? I am an entertainer, not a prostitute. Don't talk nonsense. Deputy Commander Sun, let me handle it. As long as you tell us the truth, you are free. Did the Jin man say anything to you? Nothing. He told me nothing. He asked me to sing. I sang and danced for him. That's all. Even if you ask me to make things up, I cannot make up anything else. Soldiers, she is all yours. Get away from me. Lord He. Lord Wu. Handling a case does not need to be so rude. I would like to ask your advice. How should I question them? Those woman have been around. They are shrewd. Just talking? It is useless. We will do a trick for her. Do you mind? Nothing at all. Miss, give me your instrument. Give it to me. What are their names? Swallow. Plum. Swallow, a nice name. I have two pieces of agate. One red and one blue. Which one would you like to choose? Don't be afraid. Just tell him. Red, or blue? Don't be afraid. I have a sharp knife. There is a flick between the red and the blue. When the blade is locked, one dies. When the blade retracts, one lives. Let's have a try. Miss Plum, don't be afraid. Stand up. Stand up. Which one do you choose? Stop crying. I will choose for her. Wait. I remember... I remember now. The night watchman rang the gong twice. But the Jin man did not last two hours. Something is wrong with the time. That's all. My lords, can I put it this way? The night watchman rang the first gong earlier and knocked off. He rang the second gong later at the camp. So no one patrolled during the time in between. Something is wrong with the night watchman. Let's go. Is there anything special doing it with the Jin man? You bastard. You can only think of nasty things. Piss off. Ding is the night watchman. Ding, the game is up. If you tell us the truth, you may live. You must have heard of Deputy Commander Sun's famous water boarding. You cannot breathe at all. Now we are close to Shanxi. Water is replaced by vinegar. Speaking of vinegar, I would like to have something nice. I want to try what the prime minister eats again. Lord he. Lord Wu. Go. Yes, sir. Lord He. Lord Wu. Ding, the night watchman confessed. My lords, Commander Wang told to me to ring the gong earlier in the prime minister's yard, and later at the camp, so that lazy soldiers can be caught. He wanted them to be disciplined. I didn't dare do so. He scolded me. Do you want to frame me? You've got the balls. Commander Wang, we are all soldiers. Strength and mind matter. The fact cannot be denied. You are not a soldier. You are a flunky. Forgive me. Take him down. Yes, sir. How dare you? Guards. Here. Tie them up. Report to the prime minister. Yes. Lord he, What are you saying? He has the right to speak. I am the commander of the household battalion. Do you want to disobey me? Commander Wang, do not put us in a difficult situation. My lords, he also gave me five taels of silver. They are branded with the Jin stamp. I confessed everything. Here is the evidence. Hard evidence. Seems to be. Protect the witness. Take the order: Sun Jun rebelled. Take him down. Yes, Sir. Take the order: Sun Jun rebelled. Piss off. What's wrong? You fainted at a few bodies? Not at all. I am thrilled. The case is solved in less than two hours. Take him to search Wang's bedroom. Let him continue. Yes, sir. It's late. Get some sleep. Otherwise, the bird will not rest. Sun Jun acted at his own will. He avenged his enemy with public power. He should be punished. An order from the prime minister: Sun Jun is promoted to be the commander of the household battalion. Yes, sir. Thank you, Prime Minister. Thank you, Lord He. Commander Sun is young, brave, and resourceful. Your promotion is well deserved. I am flattered. Did I do something wrong? No pun intended. No implication of abusing power at all. Lord Wu is kidding. A wolf or a dog depends on what you feed it. I appreciate your help and support. Congratulations. Congratulations. What are you doing? I searched Wang's room three times and got nothing. Why did you tell me earlier? Lord He was giving you the badge. If I said anything, should he take it back or not? You had placed it on your waist. Did you kill the wrong person? Return the badge. It serves him right. Think it over. What should we do? Where is the silver bar? You said Wang gave this to you. It has the Jin stamp. In my life, the thing I like to touch most is not the face of a pretty girl, but a sliver bar. I can tell its purity and weight even when my eyes are closed. I found this one in Wang's room. The two are the same. They are our Song silver bars. The stamp was freshly branded. Too sloppy. You are too sloppy. Speak Why framed Wang Biao? Commander Sun, stop questioning. You will kill me no matter what I say. I am glad you know. Uncle, he is the only lead we have. If you kill him, it's a dead end. Bro, I can tell you still want to live. Wait me a second. After you, Lord Wu. Lord Wu, I have a request. Later, can I borrow your background? I have no background. I've earned everything on my own. You are right. I would like to borrow you. Bro, you don't understand our lives mean nothing. Everyone here, including the dead Wang means nothing. The most important thing is to hand the item over. If you hand it over, you can live. Everyone can live. Do you know who he is? I know The deputy director of the prime minister's office. Lord Wu. Do you know who his cousin is? The Grand Consort Wu. The beloved concubine of the emperor. Lord Wu has a distinguished status. If you hand the item over, he can make sure that we live, and meet the emperor personally. Lord Wu, am I telling the truth? Please say yes. It matters. Did you hear it? Did all of you hear it? Lord Wu said yes. As long as you hand it over, Lord Wu can make sure we live, and meet the emperor. Lord Wu has a distinguished status. What he said carries weight. I got an opportunity for you. One in a lifetime. Are you in or not? I'll go then. I killed the Jin diplomat. The Jin man is huge. How could you kill him? He was way too drunk. An easy target. Where is it? I hid it. Take me to get it. Where? Under the stone lion. Spread out. Everyone, turn away. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Alert. Don't move. Back off. Back off. Back off. Stay back. Stay back. Back off. Calm down. More. Back off. More. Lord Wu, why did not you watch out for your knife? I want a horse. What's the point of threatening me with a corporal? He is worth less than a horse. Put the knife down. Or I will shoot you. Shoot me if you wish. This guy is not a common corporal. He has the pass, and Lord Wu listens to him. He is not that simple. You are wrong. He is that simple. Shoot. Why don't you do it? Don't provoke him. Shoot. Uncle. Uncle. Don't shoot. Uncle. Don't shoot. Uncle. Commander Sun. Give him a horse. Give him a horse. Give him a fleet horse. Here it is. Get it down. The horse is tired. It does not want to get down. It has to get down. Uncle, don't shoot. If he is dead, our leads will turn cold. Did I say I will shoot him? All the guards, Step back. Let him go. Why you let him go? Commander Sun, why are we retreating? What are you doing? What are you saying? Don't shoot, bastard. I told you not to shoot. You have to shoot him dead. I aimed at his shoulders, not his throat. He moved. Cut the crap. Do you think I am blind? If he wished to die, why would he ask for a horse? He even asked the horse to get down. You killed him to cover up your tracks. Lord Wu, you saw it all. If he cannot solve the case in two hours, he should take full responsibility. Right. I saw it clearly. Commander Sun knows clearly if he was aiming at the throat or shoulders. It is important. I need to report to Lord He. How tragic. What a tragic death! Commander Sun, the Jin interpreter wants to leave. We cannot stop him. He cannot leave. How dare you wrestle me? Son of bitch. Do you want to die? Our diplomat is dead. I need to go back and report. Who would dare to stop me? The prime minister's order: no one can leave. The prime minister? The prime minister's order is not for Jin people. Song's order is not for Jin. Speak. Understand what I am saying? Piss off. Flunky. Do you wish to die? You are afraid of him, but I am not. I will die in two hours anyway. Why not kill a fake Jin man first? Uncle, do not you know how to use a knife? Were you asleep? Where are you going? To see the prime minister. Get executed. Get up. You killed the Jin interpreter? Yes. Do you know it is a capital of fence? I know. It has nothing to do with anyone else. I am the one who did it. I am here to get the death penalty. No need to see me if you wish to die. You have something to say. Your Excellency knows everything. I think it over, over and over. I think... To the point. I want to live. I want to live. Want to live? Give me a reason. In fact, the two Jin men were never here. In my opinion, it's difficult for us to justify the death of their diplomat to the Jin delegation. Now the item is gone. The Jin delegation will get more suspicious. If we let the interpreter go back and talk nonsense, the consequence can be expected. Maybe we do not even know the two Jin men were here. We dumped their bodies in the fields. They were killed by the robbers. If the Jin people asked us if we saw the two Jin men, The two Jin men? No, we did not. Aren't all the Jin men here? Where is the item? The item? Is there an item? This way, before the Jin delegation gets any evidence, the important matter at the ferry tomorrow will not be delayed. The meeting between you and the Jin delegation will not be delayed. How brave and thoughtful! Your killing was decisive. You even figured out a plan for me. I dare not. Commander Sun, your soldier is more capable than you. What do you think, Lord He? I find it plausible. At least we can explain it to the Jin delegation tomorrow. Tea for them. Put your heart at rest and drink. Do you know what kind of bird it is? Stay where you are and look. What kind of bird? Eagle. It seems to be a raven? All the people say it is a raven. But it is a common carrier pigeon. It is called a raven, because it has a rare feather color. Guess. Who gave it to me? His Majesty. I am a scholar who loves tea and poetry. I do not care about position, but reputation. I am unjustly accused of colluding with Jin, punishing Yue Fei and framing the loyal ones. My political opponents compare this bird to me. They are directing at me. What I care most is to clarify these accusations and prejudices. Because it is about my honor and reputation. Find another lead. There is still time. Commander Sun, if nothing is found before we leave, I can only believe that you killed the man on purpose. When the time is up, before His Excellency gives the order, I will kill you first. What do you mean? He pressurizes you. You pressurize me. I took care of your creditors three years ago. I took you in at the household battalion. I saved your life. I repaid my sister. Think with your crooked mind. How about thinking with your mind too? I have an idea. Let's go to the servants' yard. What did Ding say? Wanted to eat again what the prime minister eats. "Again" exposed him. He was a night watchman. How could he have tried the prime minister's food? He must have friends in the kitchen. Do you want to go with me? Just find who his friend is. I will arrest him. Do you want to know what the item is? Not at all. You are still up, Peach? Uncle Liu, do you know what kind of fruit it is? Your mom removed their leaves and stems. How can I tell? This is a cherry. You are a clever little thing. Go have fun. We neglected this big carriage. A lot of things can be hidden in it. Cut the crap. Search if you want This shoe box is perfect for hiding things. A strong character. I have the pass, and can go anywhere in the courtyard. Wang and Ding died at the hands of Sun. Sun is tied up in this. Ding died tragically. Don't take the letter yet. Change of plans. Why? Lord He is more vicious than we thought. He is good at using daggers. If we do not get rid of him, we cannot get close to Qin. We haven't had the opportunity. I'll do it myself. No. If I fail, please take care of Peach for me. Her mother is Willow, the cook. Nobody knows I am her father. You are really something. Peach has not known you are her father yet. People like us cannot expose our weakness. It is a family heirloom. Give it to her. I do not know how to take care of children. Somebody has to do it. When it is done, I will set off fireworks. What did you get? Nothing. Nothing. You wasted so much time there. I misjudged the situation. I am just a corporal, not even a sergeant. I'm not that good. I am not always right. Ding said, he wants to eat what the prime minister eat again. Did you hear if he said "again" or not? How could I know if he said "again" or not? Were you here? I was here. You were here and you did not hear. What were you doing? Both of you were here. Did you hear if Ding said "again"? Again? I did not hear clearly. You were here and did not hear either. I'd rather you were not here. Let's think back. The dancer said that the time was not right. It gave us Ding. Ding gave us Wang, and took us to find the letter. He attempted to escape. Then you shot him dead. More back. Ding framed Wang. You killed Wang. If I had not killed Wang, Ding would die even earlier. More back. Do you find it is difficult to go further back? Have you noticed all the leads turned cold when it came to one person? Who? You. I am afraid the prime minister feels the same. I want to say something to you. Great. This time we'll hear carefully. You are not needed here. Get lost. Stupid. Uncle, we are in the same boat. Rats. We are at most in two parallel boats. No connections. Do you know what the prime minister is looking for? It has nothing to do with me. The Jin diplomat... Shut up. I'll shut up. I'll shut up. He brought a secret letter. Zhang Da, you are so vicious. Now we are in the same boat. I did not hear anything. Denial is useless, uncle. This letter could be the evidence. It is very important. All the people who know its existence will die. The prime minister will know that you know what it is, since you are following me. You cannot get out of it. No matter this letter is found or not, you will have to die. I will have to die. The most important is that we know what we are doing. We have to do something. Lord He's yard. Lord He. Commander Sun, someone was trying to kill me. Are you all right? I'll live. Guard the door. This man told me that he wanted to give me something important in private. I asked guards to leave. Just a piece of blank paper. Lord He, I saw the fireworks. Are you all right? Lord He, are you all right? I am fine. A burglar, and a piece of blank paper, got the whole place in an uproar. A piece of blank paper? This is Liu Xi, the horseman. Give him to me. He will confess. He has confessed. He has? This horseman is a tough guy. However, even a tough guy has weakness. One person in the kitchen is his weakness. Does he think I don't know? Is there anything I don't know here? He said, after he killed me, he would set off fireworks. People who came, are his accomplices. It turns out that you three are here. Fireworks appeared out of nowhere. Should I come to have a look? You should. Lord He, Me. Do you even suspect me? What a coincidence! Are you his accomplice or not? We can find it out by playing a game. Each of you will stab him. How about that? Each of you. Have a go. I have killed more people in the battlefield than people they have seen. An enemy deserves to die. But a game like this is absurd. A little bit. Killing a person sometimes can cover up your tracks. Killing a person sometimes can prove your innocence. The prime minister will decide if it is absurd. So, you can decide how to stab him, and if you're going to stab him. It is up to you. Lord He, let me do it first. Good. Lord He likes to play games and do tricks. Today we will play the game with him. Let me do it first. What a delicate stab! After this one, his chances of living are 60%. 60%. 40%. Good. You hesitated. You were slow. I were slow? Lord He, I am afraid that he would die too soon, and we are letting him off a bit too easy. Am I slow? Am I slow? Am I slow? Am I slow? Am I slow? Am I slow? Am I slow? That's enough. His chances of living are less than 1%. You passed the test. Please go. I need medical treatment. Lord He, I am curious. What did Liu confess? He did not confess any thin. I searched him and found fireworks. I let them off for fun. For fun? Uncle, Uncle, I cannot do it anymore. I stabbed him a dozen times. It will bite me in the ass. My goodness! I am not the bad person. Lord He forced me. Please take him away. He wants to get us killed. He suspected me. He suspected you. You can count on him to blame everything on us. He will get us killed. Peach. How do you know my name? Why are you here? There were fireworks. Someone took me to watch it. What are you having, little thief? I did not steal them. My mother gave them to me. They are cherries. Very rare. Very rare. Give them to me. One for you. With a stem. Just one. You are really a clever little thing. Go. Lord Wu. Lord Wu. Where is the letter? What? What are you talking about? Knock it off. What? Except the three of us, No one is allowed to come in. Yes, sir. Commander Sun, have a seat. Cousin. Nephew. I am his nephew. Uncle and nephew. Am I talking to you? Consort Wu is not my cousin. She is my aunt. I am her nephew. No one knows this secret. You are half right. Don't worry. I will not tell anyone else. Aunts are closer than cousins. So, give this letter to me. I will give it to my aunt. She will give it to the emperor. You will be rewarded for your great service. What letter? Take it out. I Take it out. Liu used the real letter when he tried to kill Lord He. He did not use a piece of blank paper. Lord He hid the real letter. It is all a ploy. But not a good one. How do you know? He did not use the right blank paper. Not Jin paper. Where is the real letter? Under the ink stone. Right The ink stone seems be uneven. When you stabbed Liu, Commander Sun took the real letter. It turns out your hand was faster than mine. The whole time I am the only one in the dark. Uncle, you want the letter too? Why are you hiding it? You must be kidding. How dare I hide it? I will present it to the prime minister. I don't think. You big shots. All have your own small plans. You take me as a fool. I know whoever has the letter, gets something on the prime minister. Later, he might live. In the end, only I have to die. Are you people even human? I quit. I quit. How dare you? Uncle, I only need to spit it out. I won't quit. Did you replace it with blank paper? Why don't you open it? Check it out. You are a lowlife. It doesn't matter if I am a lowlife or not. The letter was brought by my uncle. He should open it. It doesn't have to be me. You are the most senior. You should open it. It doesn't have to be me either. You should open it. You said it's blank paper. You should read it. I cannot read it. How about... I did not even enter the room. It must be in Jin language. All of us don't know it. How could we tell it is the real letter? Someone must know the language. How about the dancer? She can entertain the Jin man. She must be able to speak their language. At least, she could tell if it is in their language. Right. Please take her here, Commander Sun. Do you know Jin language? No. I don't. I don't. I have told you everything I know. I only heard two sounds of ringing the gong. I don't know anything else. Did I ask you about the gong? You said you did not know their language. You must be clear that you are involved in the death of the Jin man. Even if we don't kill you, we could lock you up for years. Now, I am giving you a chance. As long as you told me, if it is in the Jin language, Commander Sun and | can let you live. Am I right, Commander Sun? Yes. It did not matter how much you understand. We only need you to tell us if it is. Right. I know the Jin language. That's right. Is it the Jin language? Yes. From whom to whom? Put your hands down. You can hear me. Why pretending? Everyone in this room is involved. Listen to me. Who wrote this letter? To Whom? Wan yan Zongbi wrote to Qin Hui, the prime minister of Song. Wan yan Zongbi is Jin Wuzhu. Good. Give it to me. No need to read it. Give it to me. Wan yan Zongbi Quickly. Uncle. Commander Sun. No. No. No. No. No. Commander Sun. Why are you eating it? Are you that hungry? Commander Sun, she is the only one who read the letter. It's useless to kill her. You won't get it back. Give her to me. Lord Wu, behind you. Step back. Step back. Step back. Step back. You bitch. Why did you draw my knife? Back off. Uncle, put the knife back. Zither, calm down. We didn't mean you any harm. I only have one question. Why do you have to eat that letter? Do you intend to let me live, the two lords? I have no such an intention. I know you do not have such an intention. Just now you did not dare to look. I know whoever reads the letter, must die. Even if only reads one word. So, I will talk after I eat it. I have to find a way to live. How smart you are. She ate it after reading it. Now, she becomes the letter. Whoever wants to know what the letter is about. Cannot kill her. I will live as long as I can. A nice move. Now we cannot do anything to you. Nothing? I don't believe it. Commander Sun. Back off. Calm down. Calm down. Lord Wu, may I borrow your background? My background? Sure. Hurry up. Zither, calm down. You want to live. One person can make sure of it. That's Lord Wu. Me. Do you know who he is? He is the emperor's beloved consort, Consort Wu's cousin. Nephew. Consort Wu is his father's cousin. He is the nephew of Consort Wu. My aunt. He is Consort Wu's nephew. Consort Wu is his aunt. They are that close. If you want to live, You only need his words. You can stay alive. Yes. My words. Trust us. Calm down. Yes. Calm down. Right. Right. Put the knife down. Calm down. Calm down Come on. You two can step outside. Too many people might get under her skin. Let me talk to her. I look kind. I am good at comforting women. Go outside. You are trying to get rid of us. I dare not. What I mean is you can come back later. Nothing else. Fine. I will persuade her. I have experience. Go outside. Go outside. Go outside. Zither. Uncle, we are in big trouble now. You stole the letter from Lord He. We cannot keep a lid on this. If the prime minister knows, we are dead. You three should not go anywhere. Keep an eye on the yard. Be clear about who is going in and out. Yes. Lord He, Lord He, we found the evidence. What is it? It is a letter. Where did you find it? It was under your ink stone. Nonsense. Only a piece of blank paper was on my table. You all saw it. Sure. I saw it with my own eyes. Lord Wu did. He said that he stole it unnoticed. That's irresponsible remarks. He is telling a downright lie. Why did he tell you? I think he looks suspicious. I drew him out. Wu Yichun? Yes. The emperor doubts my loyalty after all. He wants to have something on me. Ridiculous. He sent a bungling oaf to spy on me. What happened to your arm? I am fine. There are rumors that Wu Yichun is a relative of Consort Wu. He even carries with an item from the emperor. His family name just happens to be Wu. The wolf has a winning game when the shepherds quarrel. Go on. My lords. Anyone out? No one. Lord Wu said, he would take the dancer with him to the capital overnight. How dare he? Where is the woman? Lord Wu, where is she? In the room. She is there. Give her to me. No. You impressed me. Lord Wu made the tea. Shall we stand to have it? Have a seat. Sit too. I dare not. Do as you're told. Then I will sit a little. Having tea must follow old rules. One cup of tea, and one sentence. After we drink it, we shall talk about the woman in the room. Come on. Commander Sun first. One sentence. Give her to me. It's Lord Wu's turn. Nothing to say? I really do not understand why Lord Wu wants to interfere today? Fine. I will give you a reason. Are you crazy? It is the gold badge. Do you know what does it mean? I can do whatever I want here. Everyone has to cooperate, including the prime minister. Don't touch. You touch? You will die if you do. It is above you level and rank. Nice. She is in my custody. I will bring her to see the emperor overnight. No one shall stand in my way. You have been in the office for two years. You are more than an ornament. You are playing a long game. My turn. A warrant from the prime minister: Zither carries an important secret. She should be taken to see the emperor immediately. Due to its great importance, I've decided to interrogate her myself at once. Whoever disobeys, will be executed. I have the emperor's badge. Whoever disobeys, will be executed. More from the warrant: Many things are happening. Zheng Wan, the vice general will be my guard. Wu Yichun shall not go upstairs. I can read. Every word is targeting at me. Right. Otherwise, there will be one word left: Executed. You are bullies. Does the emperor's gold badge mean nothing to you? Have you read history books? The gold badge always works. Lord He, do you know where this letter came from? Can I have a word? No, you cannot. I know. I only care about the moment. Fine. At the moment, I have a cup of tea. Leave it there. Since there is a rule, you can speak. My words are not that important. I just want to remind you that woman has a knife with her. A knife? Who gave it to her? Lord Wu's knife was stolen again? Just now she pressed the knife against her throat. She threatened to commit suicide. Why did not you say it earlier? I will take her down. Go away. Stay calm, Commander Sun. Hold... Hold Lord Wu up. Lord Wu, Lord Wu, wake up! Lord Wu. Do you want to wake me up, or slap me? How dare 1? Lord Wu, you are awake. Lord Wu is awake. Are you okay? I am screwed. Totally screwed. Are you sure it is the real letter? I am sure. I saw it with my eyes. A hundred percent. Not a piece of blank paper? No. She only said two sentences. Did you see her ate it? I saw that. She ate it quickly. In the blink of an eye. Commander Sun wanted to open her mouth with a knife. Cut her stomach. Good idea. Cut her stomach. This paper is not digested yet. The words are there. Leave us. Yes. Lord Wu outwitted us. This is not Zither. This is Plum. Wu strangled her and changed their clothes. He tricked us. He wants to take Zither away by himself. You are so vicious. She is innocent. Such a young girl was strangled by you. What a switcheroo! You are heartless. Lord Wu, where is she? She should be in the backyard, My lords, I was keeping an eye on the gate. No one came out. If he wants to get her out, the window is the only exit. There are a lot of people outside. I think Lord Wu dare not take Zither away blatantly. He should have hidden her in one of these rooms. The left shed is locked. The window. Lord He, I have the key. I have the key. Lord He, I made a terrible mistake today. I was arrogant. Please forgive me. Don't say anything to the prime minister. Commander Sun, please go there and take the girl out. Persuade her with nice words. He doesn't know how to say nice words. You You can send her in. You should be able to take her out. It was difficult to send her in. You are the perfect person. If you cannot take her out, whatever happened in the past stays in the past, in front of the prime minister. Are you serious? No. No. I strangled her friend. You are the best person to go there. You are totally innocent in front of her. She will let her guard down. If you bring her out, I promise you will live. Do you trust me? Do you trust him? Uncle, do you trust him? I trust him. I cannot go. If you are not sure, how could I be sure? What's more, maybe she is dead already. You don't have a choice. Uncle, I am the scapegoat. Zither, don't be afraid. I see you have a knife in your hand. I don't have any weapon with me. Put the knife down Don't press it against your throat. Don't hurt yourself. That's right. Woman, why are you here? Why cannot I be here? I bribed the liaison officer. Plum, Swallow and I came in as the dancers. Do you want to go for me? Sure. Qin Hui wants to see me so urgently. He wants me to tell him what the letter is about. It will be only he and me. There won't be a third person. I have a better chance than you. How can you replace me? Why risk yourself? Are you as clever as me? I am afraid that you cannot get it done. Cleverer? It is not the time to compare. You act on your own. You get yourself trapped. You should not be involved with state affairs. Why should not I do it? My parents and brothers were all killed by the Jin men. I had to work in a brothel and be called a heartless whore. I've lived a few peaceful years after I met you. State affairs, or revenge. We are in this together. We planned it for years. But no plan can remain unchanged. We just have to play it by ear. Liu Xi should not die in vain. We have to get rid of Lord He and Lord Wu. Where did you get the letter? Commander Sun stole it from the bottom of your ink stone. Nonsense. Was there only a piece of blank paper on the desk? Where do you say it comes from? Lord Wu is kidding with you. This letter must be found in Liu Xi's carriage. The prime minister is aware of this. We should not talk recklessly. Right. Lord He is wise. Let's be clear. When I drank with the Jin man, I did not do anything with him. I lied to them. I know. You know? Why did you confront me in front of so many people? Are you jealous? Do you remember? When we first met, you told me you were from the borders, and you had never seen cherries in poems. I said I would find an opportunity to show you. But I have not got that chance. You are a careless person. I am surprised you can remember this. Fine. When we are in front of the Death Lord, I won't blame you for the bad things you did. How about singing your favorite cherry song? When can I go home to wash my robe to play my flute and burn the incense? Time is flying. Cherries turn red, and banana leaves turn green. Why don't you sing with me? I am not in the mood. Your dirty man. You always sang with me. Are you tired of me? Do you want to sing? Hold me if you don't want to sing. It's your last chance. Slut. What are you calling me? Slut. My lords. Lord He. I have Lord Wu's knife. I will give it back to you. Lord Wu. Lord Wu. I have the knife. Lord Wu. After the prime minister reads the letter, Zither will die. The next one will be you. Thank you for the heads up. Do you want to gamble? What could I gamble with? The prime minister will meet her one on one. So, she needs to have a sharp weapon. A sharp weapon? What's that for? If she has a weapon, she can live. The letter will be safe too. Sun Jun and the guards are afraid of hurting the prime minister. They won't do anything hasty. Then she will ask for three horses. She will take you and me as hostage. We will dash out the yard. Then we will have the chance to go the capital and see the emperor. Do you think we will have a chance? Ding tried. I am not a kid. The prime minister has not read the letter. Sun Jun has already made a mistake. Will he dare to shoot again? He is not responsible if she runs away. However, if she is dead, he will be finished. Do you want to bet? Lord He, do you have the prisoner? Search the prisoner. Lord He, I want to explain to the prime minister face to face. I have done shameless things. But you are forgiving. I have offended you many times, Lord He. You are being foolish. Go upstairs, and clear things up. Take off your knife. All searched. Only one person? Lord Wu, the prime minister asked us to leave. Can I explain to the prime minister? Go downstairs. Just two sentences. What is more important? Speak. Ask them to leave. They cannot hear. Fine. Come. Closer. Recite the letter. Every word. Will you let me live? If you recite well. To Mr. Qin Hui. The prime minister of Song. Yours truly Wan yan Zongbi Come in. Your Excellency, the show is over. We have all the bad guys. We wait for your instructions. Let's get started. What do you mean? Zhang Da. Lord He. Pick one stone. Let fate decide. I will choose. Too late. Like I said before, even a tough guy has weakness. Your weakness is her. I guess she is your woman? You are good. What a splendid show! No matter how calculating you are, His Excellency has directed it to our advantage, and I have plotted out every move of yours. You neglected one thing. I know the weakness of Liu. How could he not confess? How could I be so foolish? To let you go? So the fact is that he confessed everything. Impossible. He could not confess. When I killed Willow, his woman, he did not confess anything. When I was about to kill Peach, his daughter, how could he not confess? Where is Peach? I I'll kill you, you bastard. He Li, I will kill you. Just wait and see. Just wait and see. Don't let me wait too long. Your Excellency, shall I continue? Continue. Summon Wu Yichun, the deputy director. On July 3, 1146, He Li, the director of the prime minister's office, interrogates the assassins. Wu Yichun assists the interrogation. The secretary takes down the notes. The prime minister listened to the interrogation. Ding Sanwang, the night watchman, is an accomplice of Zhang Da. He used the loophole in timing, and killed the Jin diplomat, and created chaos to get close to the prime minister. Zhang Da, am I right? Yes. You are right. Liu Xi, the horseman, is an accomplice of Zhang Da. He lurked in the prime minister's office, and attempted to kill the director. He admitted everything. Zhang Da, am I right? Yes. Liu Xi, Ding Sanwang, and Zhang Da plotted together. They framed Wang Biao, the commander of the battalion, and got him killed. Zhang Da, am I right? Wang Biao was framed. Someone wanted to kill him with my hand. I am asking if I am right? Yes. If you say so. So, did Zither your accomplice, use the secret letter to get close to the prime minister and try to attack him? She failed and was captured. Am I right, Zhang Da? Yes. As to Commander Sun, it's hard to define what you have done. Sun Jun, the commander of the battalion, is not involved with Zhang Da's plotting. However, you were misled by him. You are under suspicion of killing to cover your tracks. You have selfish motives and are indecisive. You will be put in jail, to await trial. I see. One more thing, Your Excellency, the dagger used by Zither, looks familiar to me. We shall ask Lord Wu. He has a good memory. Lord Wu, how does your knife end in her hand? Is it mine? I've never seen this one. If I don't use some tricks, how can I get Lord Wu to play such a show? Listen. During the interrogation, Zhang Da stabbed Lord Wu. Take the Order: Give Lord Wu an honorable burial and send a pigeon to the capital to report. Yes. Have you taken them down? Your Excellency, I have. Good. The three can stay. Others can leave. Yes, sir. Now, the real interrogation starts. First, who is behind this? Second, you can live if you tell me what's in the letter. I,the prime minister of Song. Give you my word. Are you afraid that I am making things up? I can tell after you recite one sentence. We are going to be in trouble then. I forget everything. Lord He, Torture. You are good at it. I would like to redeem myself. Please allow me. Show me what you've got. Thanks, Your Excellency. Zhang Da, let go of me. Get in. Zither. Take him down. Zither, I will see who dares to lay a finger on her. Zither. Zither. Sun Jun, I will kill you. Zither. Sun Jun, if family means anything to you, please kill my newly married wife. Don't do that to her. Water. Yes, sir. Use vinegar. Yes. You are ruthless. You certainly redeem yourself. Pour. Up. Just confess, Zhang Da. You don't know what the prime minister is capable of. You will surrender. I will not surrender. If I confess, will your life be saved? More. My nephew, everything else is fake. Only life is real. You should be clear. Just confess. So you can live. I can explain to my sister. You are a true flunky. Who is a flunky? You. You are a flunky. Pour. Come on. Pour. Up. Commander Sun, He peed. Are we still pouring? Hold him up. You helped to raise me when I was little. It's my turn to take care of you. Suddenly you became a tough guy. Something is not right. Loyalty. General Yue's tattoo by his mother. Soldiers of the Yue army had the same tattoo. You are really a solider of the Yue army. Only a tattoo. You cannot do it anymore? Hold him still. Suck it up. The tattoo cannot stay. Hold him still. When it is gone, your faith will be gone. Then you will confess. Do you confess? Commander Sun, you have to work on his weakness. More soldiers for the woman. Yes. Let go of me. Zhang Da. Let go of me. Zhang Da. Zhang Da. I confess. I confess The prime minister wants to know the real text, not whatever you interpreted. Jin Wuzhu used Chinese. Zither lied to you. Stop. Come on out. What do you mean? Zhang Da. Are you going to confess? You are a wimp. Are you even a man? Are you even a man? Alright. Take the woman away, to the stable. Commander Sun, has redeemed himself. He will not go to jail for the time being. I will report to the prime minister. Thanks, Lord He. Zhang Da confessed everything. You don't believe me? He said, it was a voluntary operation. There is no man behind it And you joined halfway. Your action was not in their plan. You acted on your own. Is it right? Now you believe me. His Excellency has given an order: Execution on site. Zhang Da is a rascal. He only likes eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. He is a wimp. I should have known better. His Excellency also said, one of you two can live. Who can live? I can decide. Condition? The condition is you recite the letter to me. Did Zhang Da confess? Why don't you let him recite to you? You are the only person who read the letter. Zhang Da also told me that, you also saw this letter. How come you did not read it? No one dared, except His Excellency. No one dared. Now you dare to listen to it? To read the letter without permission is a capital crime. However, listening to the prisoner's confession is important to solve a case. Not guilty. How smart you are! Recite to me, and I will let you go. Not to His Excellency. Once you know the content of the letter, you'll always have something on Qin Hui. You will have a safety net. You are smart. If I recite it to you, you will not kill me? I will not kill you. I will find a corpse to displace you. I will report your death to the prime minister. And I promise you will have a comfortable life in the future. Right. Whenever the letter is needed, I, the witness, will be needed. Otherwise, you are making things up. You are really smart. What if I don't recite? You can live if you recite. Otherwise, you have to die. It's up to you. I have nothing to lose. One condition. Bring me to see Zhang Da. What for? I hate renegades. I cannot accept that a turncoat like him can live. I have to kill him with my own hands, If you don't agree. I won't recite. Did you go in? No. Why put a gag on him? Do you want to listen? It is important. I should listen. You just redeemed yourself. Don't look for trouble. Take those chains off me. Take them off. Use this one. Why this? You can use this one with chains on. Fine. Any knife will do. I also have one condition. You can only stab him once. Why? This knife has always been used this way. Don't break my rules. Red or blue? Let's fate decide. I don't care. One single entry. No matter he will live or die, you will recite the letter. Do you want a bet? Fine. One singe entry it is. Do you have anything else to say? I cannot take it anymore. I've failed you. You've not only failed me, but also Ding and Liu. I've failed everyone. You bought my freedom for me from the brothel. I am setting you free today, for the sake of our marriage. Woman, I love you. Stop crying. Your hands will not be steady if you cry. Which one will you pick, red or blue? When the two are pressed at the same time, the blade will be locked. Am I right? Kill him. Zither. Zither. Kill him. Zither. Kill him. Zither. Zither. Zither. Kill him. Zither. Zither. Zither. When can I go home to wash my robe to play my flute and burn the incense? Time is flying. Cherries turn red, and banana leaves turn green. Son of bitch. Throw Sun Jun and him into a cell. They will be sent to the capital tomorrow morning. Yes, sir. Zheng, Lord He agreed to let me redeem myself, and I don't need to go to prison. Lord He? Tell him to rise up and talk to me. I am following the prime minister's order. I did not let them really hurt Zither. That's just a stunt. She should not get involved. If we die here, that's fine. If we can get out of here, we will drink and gamble, and be a common citizen. We will not get involved in state affairs anymore. A little woman like Zither, dares to use herself as a setup to kill He Li. What's her purpose? Do you think I can live with myself? What do you want? So many people died because of this letter. All of people involved want to have a safety net. You are the same. You hid the letter. No matter what you do, you will die. In my opinion, there is only one way out for you, to live in a dignified way. Are you out of your mind? If I tell you, the whole thing is not over yet. You have more accomplices? Yes. It's you. You are our last move. When you came to me, you told me you wanted to make a living. What you really want is today. Do you want to hear my plan? From now on, I will only speak the truth. Ding framed Wang. By moving his throat to your arrow, he also framed me. Qin Hui is suspicious. He will kill you sooner or later. We have to burn your bridge, then you will rebel. True. You guys are vicious. We found ways to get rid of Lord Wu and Lord He. So they won't be in your way. Then I will become the highest ranking official here. Just now I confessed everything, except one thing. I read the letter. I will write it on the wall. Qin Hui will come here to see. He will bring no one else with him. Then, we will have an opportunity. We are unarmed. I even have chains. I practiced many times. I can unlock the chains. Qin Hui is weak. We can handle him easily, even with our bare hands. What next? You are the highest ranking official here. You can control the situation. The two adjutants are your men. If I swear that Zheng Wan, the deputy general, was behind this, you could use it as an excuse to kill him. Then all people in the leads are dead. You will find a way to finish the rest. You surprise me. You are so brave and resourceful, totally different from the man you were. In the earlier years, I was a hooligan. After I joined General Yue's army, I changed. You were a nobody in the Yue army. How could you think of something big like this? When I included you in our plan, everybody thought I was crazy. But they trusted me with their lives for the greater good. Because they had faith in me. And | have faith in you. It is not a game of setups, but hearts. How can you so sure that I will work with you at last? A moment ago, when you did not really remove my tattoo, you pretended to do so, and I pretended to be painful. We tricked Lord He. Why would you risk everything to leave the tattoo? I know he reason you left it, is to keep the heart and the integrity. You care your sister most. You want her to know that you are not a flunky of the Jin men, and a lackey for Qin Hui. That year, on the New Year's Eve, you went home to see your sister. She called you a flunky, and asked you to leave. You sat on the hillside alone, motionless. From afar, you were covered with snow, looking like a snowman, that we made together when you were little. It's cold that day. But I knew that you were not cold hearted. There was still warmth in your heart. You are different from He Li, Different from Qin Hui. You are a young general of Song. An hotblooded soldier. You hate people call you flunky. You care it so much. It means that you don't want to be considered as a flunky all your life. I am pleading you to sacrifice yourself for the dead General Yue and for the people of Song. Fetch Chen Liang. Fetch him. Commander Sun. Ask for a brush and a jar of ink. Go quickly. One more thing. Report to the prime minister. To Mr. Qin Hui, the prime minister of Song. Yours Wan yan Zongbi. What? Prime minister of Song, Wan yan Zongbi Just those words. Go quickly. Urgent. Yes, sir. Prime minister of Song. Get out of the way. Prime minister of Song. Wan yan Zongbi Prime minister of Song. Prime minister of Song. Wan yan Zongbi Prime minister of Song. A message from Commander Sun. Commander Sun? Sun Jun, the prisoner? Yes. It's urgent. The prime minister will set off for the ferry at once. Can it be more urgent than this? Your Excellency, a message from Commander Sun. It's urgent. Speak. Yes. His message is: Prime minister of Song, Wan... What are you talking about? Is it Wan yan Zongbi? Yes. I did not remember all the words. Where is Sun Jun? In the cell of the east yard. Go to the cell and double the guards. No one can go in. Yes. Stand by. I will see it myself. Right. Don't go. Sapphire will accompany me alone. It might not be safe. How about I go first? There is no need. It is the letter. It is the proof that you are colluding with Jin. Who do you think am I? Who are you? You are a traitor, selling out your country. You are the same as the raven in your cage. Two vicious birds. Read this letter well. It is clear. I make peace with Jin so we can recuperate. I've devoted myself to my country. People call me a traitor. But I am telling you that later generations will appreciate. They will build statues for me. I bet that you will be called a traitor forever. I would like to have this bet. I will bet everything I have. It's a pity that we will not see the result ourselves. Go ahead. Go ahead. Excellent. Thank you. Commander Sun, a great move. You drew him out. Thank you. He Li cooperated well with you. But he became a victim of his own desires. You are not a match for me. Not even close. From the moment I gave you the pass, I played two hours with you. What I am waiting to see is that you wrote the letter. Flunky. Sorry to trouble you. Your shoulders? Nothing serious. It's fine. Clean the words on the wall. Not one word should be kept. Before it's done, nobody can enter. Please feel assured. Sun Jun, the commander of the household battalion, is brave, careful, and faithful. He has done a good service to protect me. He will be rewarded 1000 taels of gold, and promoted to the director of my office. Thank you, prime minister. Get ready. Set off at once. Yes, sir. Take the order: Set off at once. Yes, sir. Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! I appreciate your help in the future. Sure. After I was put into jail by you, I got promoted. I should thank you. You are kidding me. Gather the bodies of the assassins. Send them to the capital. The prime minister wanted to burn the bodies here. His Excellency wanted or you wanted? I dare not. It is really what he wanted. Where is the prime minister? Upstairs. Wait here. I will talk to him. I'm afraid it's not appropriate. Are you accusing me? I dare not. A moment, please. I have the duty. Though you are the director, you need follow the rules. Your knife and armor have to stay here. Of course. Your Excellency, we can set off. The Jin diplomat and his interpreter died. We have to make a gesture. What do you mean? Chen Liang and Hu Yong, the two adjutants, did not do a good job. They should be sacrificed. Give the heads of our two capable officers to Jin. I am afraid... You will no longer work at the household battalion. Your successor will not use your adjuncts. The two will face an awkward situation anyway. If we do this right, everyone walks away happily. You said my reward was 1000 taels of gold. May I be bold enough to ask for another reward instead? You don't want 1000 taels of gold? What else can be so precious? Everyday you look at this ominous creature. I guess you want to remind yourself of the accusations against you. What happened today made those accusations even more absurd. I think you should not keep this bird anymore. How about giving it to me? It will be a proper place for it. What you said makes sense. You've learned the way of being an official. You shall have this reward. Take my order: Set off. Anything else? I've found out the true purpose of Zhang Da. Is it not to kill me? They used so many lives to trade for your life. Do you think it is worth it? What do you think? Your life in their eyes is worth nothing. What they want is a text. A text? The night before Yue Fei was executed, he wrote a text on the wall of his cell. The jailer cannot read. He only knew it has 22 lines. After Yue Fei was executed, you stood long before the wall. You must have memorized it. After you left, all the words were removed. In this world, only you know Yue's final words. Zhang Da and his friends wanted to hold a knife against your throat and force you to recite those words. Weren't they afraid that I would recite it wrongly under the threat of a knife? Yue is your lifelong political opponent. You must have thought of his final words at midnights. What if I don't recite? They would use their methods. So, you will finish what they started? You are one of them? No, I am not. Why? I just gave you a promotion. Your Excellency, it is only for appearance. In your eyes, I am a hound that can bite. After the cunning hare is killed, the hound will be boiled. You will kill me sooner or later. Either after the meeting at the ferry today, or some day in the future. You've burned your bridges. You did not think like that at the beginning. When did you change? All the time. And all the time not. If we have to find a time, it is when I was removing Zhang Da's tattoo on his back. His tattoo pushed me. What was his tattoo? Loyalty. Do you think you can hold a knife against my throat? This is better than a knife. I've placed a letter on the leg of the pigeon. Just the one you read in the cell. If I set it free, it will fly back to it home, the Imperial Palace. I have had the letter removed. When Zhang Da wrote it on the wall, I've memorized it. I wrote one myself. Impossible. You're bluffing? Do you want to take your chances? Once this bird is back to the capital, you are aware of what your opponents can do. All you family members will be killed. You will have a foul reputation forever. Recite the final words of General Yue, or I will set the bird free. Catch it. Just a piece of blank paper. You surely know how to threaten me. Just now in the cell why did not you make the move? I see. To kill Zhang Da was your last move. Of course. Otherwise, how I could fool you? That's a tragic setup. Zhang Da laid down his life and you were ruthless. How heroic! Shut up. Go outside with me What do you want? Act calmly. Do what I say. What's your answer? Recite. I'll recite. Wait a second. Take the order: Recite after the prime minister. Haven't you heard what Director Sun just said? Take the order: Recite after the prime minister. Take the order: Recite after the prime minister. Take the order: Recite after the prime minister. Take the order: Recite after the prime minister. Take the order: Recite after the prime minister. Take the order: Recite after the prime minister. Take the order: Recite after the prime minister. My last words to reflect my thoughts. My last words Yue Fei. To reflect my thoughts. Yue Fei. General Yue. My last words to reflect my thoughts. My last words to reflect my thoughts. My last words to reflect my thoughts. Recite after the prime minister. My last words to reflect my thoughts.

Can they remember clearly? Do you want me to recite it one more time? Take the order: Stand by. Stand by. Yes, sir. Stand by. Go back. Stand by. Don't move. Yes, sir. Are you satisfied with what I recited? I am satisfied with myself. Prime Minister, come on out. How could you know he is a double? From what he said before he died. What? Finally, I can be myself. Bastard. Be yourself. How much efforts have I spent in cultivating him? When did you use the double? When you talked to Zheng Wan, and found an excuse to go upstairs. It's not a good excuse. You gave it away. You are paranoid. If you were me, you will be the same. Was it him I saw the whole day? It's him when Zither stabbed me. The rest was me. How can it always be him? He would think himself as the prime minister if I always use him. I cannot let that happen. Why could he recite Full River Red? By accident. I'm fortune's fool. Only he can recite it. I did not even know the existence of such a text. Do you know how many people want to assassinate me? The Storm Pavilion... You were afraid. He went to the Storm Pavilion instead of you. He lied to me. He lied to me. No wonder the water in the ditches were black. He had the words removed, and the wall washed. He lied to me. He did not tell me. He remembered every word of it for so many years. He recited it to you vividly. How dare he? How dare you? Do you know? I was listening to your passionate recitation. Who do you think you are? Yue Fei? I wish I could cut your tongue out. I understand. He might have recited it many times in his dreams. Now he can recite it loudly. For him, death is a relief. No wonder there have been rumors about Yue's last words. I killed several prison guards for that. He must be the source. After today, you cannot live. Is it worth it? Full River Red will be in this world. It's worth it. The poem was well written. Then, shall we sit here forever? We have a deal that you won't kill me. Zhang Da said, death would be too good for you. They wanted to let you live. You will be reviled by the people. Some things are more important than life and death. So, they sacrificed their lives one after another, for this poem Full River Red. Take the order: Put the set off on hold. Stand by. Without His Excellency's permission, no one should see him. Recite the poem. Take the order: Put the set off on hold. Stand by. Without His Excellency's permission, no one should see him. Recite the poem. Recite the poem. Put the set off on hold. Stand by. Without His Excellency's permission, no one should see him.
