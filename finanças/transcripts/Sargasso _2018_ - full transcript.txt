[muffled rock music] [chattering] [loud rock music] You're gonna have to say that again. I can't hear you. Yeah, wh... Why didn't you say so? [Missy] You're not a spy. [Ray] Never said I was. You said you spy on people. [cars honking] [Ray] You got another one of those? [exhales loudly] [Ray] Sweet. [Missy] So, what, like... You wear disguises and stuff? What? You carry a gun? [Ray] No, I don't ever carry a... I don't wanna shoot anybody. So then, what's it like? It's gotta be exciting. It can be, I guess. [Ray] I dunno. I've only been at it for a couple months, so... I'm like, still, basically in training. [laughs] I think it's hot. Oh yeah? [Missy] Spying on people. It's like... [Missy] It's kinda like voyeurism. [jazzy dreamy music] [Missy] I think I'd be a good spy. [Missy] I'm pretty sneaky. - [Ray] Are you? - [Missy] Yeah. [Missy] You should take me out with you. I could be like, your... Like your sidekick. Yeah. Follow people places that you can't go. [Ray laughs] [Ray mumbling] [jazzy music continues] [door latches] [panting] [both moaning and panting] [Ray] The fuck? [distant barking] [under breath] Oh shit. [phone notification noise] [camera powering up] [Ray] Claimant can't lift more than ten pounds. Claimant can't lift her arms over her head. Claimant has depression and anxiety as a result of the accident. [distant police sirens] [coughs] [Ray knocks] Hey Pat. You wanted to see me? [coughs] Yeah. Have a seat. [Ray clears throat] [Pat continues coughing] Well? How's it going? Things are getting easier, I think. Joe working with you at all? He's old-school, I know, but he's forgotten more about surveillance than you or I will ever know. Joe's been here so long, he trained me, almost 20 years ago now. - Wow, really? - Yeah. Back then, was he a little, uh... - Bat-shit crazy? - Yeah. [Pat] Ah, yeah. A little worse, maybe, with age. Joe's got high blood pressure, did he ever tell you that? I'm always on him... gotta quit smoking, gotta quit eating like shit, but he doesn't listen. [coughs] Anyway, what's happening with the Morgan case? Um... Honestly? - Nothing. - Nothing? We got eight days on her. [Ray] I know. [Pat] You having any trouble locating her? No, it's not that. I mean, um... I don't think so. I mean the address is accurate. And the vehicle is... Good. That's good. It'll pop. Yeah. For sure. It's a huge case. I know. I know. For us. It's a huge case for us. - Right. - It's Aegis Insurance. They were one of our biggest clients a couple of years ago. Then we fucked up real bad on one of their cases, and... And they dropped us. Really? What happened? A fucking nightmare. Our investigators stuck a GPS tracker on a claimant's car, dumb fuck. We don't do that kind of thing. [Ray chuckles] It's illegal. And anyway, the claimant took her car to a mechanic, mechanic found it. The thing was registered to our guy. Goddamn clusterfuck. So we gotta get something on Morgan. Yeah, I will. Be careful too. Don't get burned. [chuckles] Right. - I'll try not to. - Good. - Yep. - Alright. [slow piano music] [Ray] Hey. [beer bottle clicks open] I don't really understand your question. Me neither. Hm. You brought a chick home, right? I was wasted. How was she? Blonde? Was she? You like, get her number? [chuckles] Guess not. [giggles] - Oh well. - Oh well. Yeah. [slow piano music continues] [Ross] Yo. [Ross] How's your mom? Yeah. So you like, have to have insurance now. I thought it was like, illegal not to. [Ray] Wait, it is? That's what I thought. Well, I don't think they can come to arrest her, I guess. [coughing and giggling] [Ross] It's just fucked up, you know. Like... It's not like you have all this money, to just like, take care of it. Yeah, tell me about it. [crunching] I have a plan though. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Bank robbery? Something like that. [piano music continues] What do you think? About what? Same guy? I dunno, they all look the fucking same to me. - Wow. - Yeah. [Joe] How'd that surveillance go? I mean, not bad. I'm trying to get a good angle here of the building, you know, the front door. There's a huge fucking bush that's blocking it. This guy lives next to an elementary school. You know, I felt like a creep sitting there, all day. At one point, this teacher walks down to the fence and started looking at me and my car. [Joe] Jesus Christ, Ray. What is the most important thing you have to remember when you're in the field? Always park in the shade? [Joe] No. The most important thing you have to remember when you're in the field, is that if you think you're burnt on a case, You're not. Don't be paranoid. Or you'll never make it on this job. 29 years of surveillance. [shudders] I think I've been burnt, maybe five times. People in this city are stupid. They're blind. They're too wrapped up in their own shit to notice you. Yeah, tell me about it. You think, a neighbor's suspicious because they see your car? They're not. You think a claimant is looking right at you? They're not. [sighs] Unless police come tapping on your window, you're not burned. And, maybe not even then. [Joe] Unless the claimant pulls over, walks up to you, and says, "Why the fuck are you following me?" You're not fucking burned. You got it? Yeah, oh yeah. I got it. [Joe] Yeah. [sighs] Now... All that being said, you don't ever wanna get burned. [clears throat] Hey Joe, you, uh... You got any tips on, uh, you know, not getting burned when you're out on the field? No. Oh, okay. How's that big case of yours going? Oh, which one? You know, the high-exposure disability one. - Morgan? - Morgan. [Ray] Yeah, alright. Um... [Ray] You know, I honestly don't have anything on her yet. [Joe] Hm. [intense music] [Olga] Ray? Hey. H [Ray] Nice to meetcha. [Ray] It's really loud out here. Yeah, you look much younger than you sounded on the phone. [chuckles] - [Olga] You get that, huh? - [Ray] Yeah, a lot. [Olga] I do too. [Olga] Alright, this way. So you can see... - Take a look at our inventory. - Wow. [Olga] It's not bad, huh? [Olga] Whatever you need, we got. [Ray] You got a bunch of shit here, huh? [Olga] Yeah, handcuffs, whatever. [Ray mumbling] [Olga] Football... - [Ray] Not really into sports. - [Olga] No? - [Ray] Nope. - [Olga] What do you like? [Olga] Halloween? [Ray] Just sitting in my car, mostly. [Ray chuckles] [Olga] Oh, wow, okay. Well... [Ray] Being a PI. [Olga] Oh yeah... So you order through Amazon? [Ray] Yeah. [Olga laughs] - [Ray] Just camera equipment. - [Olga] Online. I see. [Olga] We also got cameras. [in foreign accent] Mr. Brey. Pleasure to meet you. [clears throat] [Ray] I mean. That's as good as I got. But there's a decent shot of his face here. Yes, it is him. You're sure? I would recognise that lying motherfucker [slams table] anywhere. Excuse my language. No, I... [chuckles] It's okay. I understand. In my opinion, Manual Macias is a lying motherfucker. Yeah. Yeah. He came to work here, for 10 years in warehouse, never take a day off. Even when his wife have baby, he come in everyday. He say he cannot miss work, he need money. Need money for rent. Need money to buy food for three children. Need money for mother's medical bills. Need money, need money, need money. He was a very hard worker. I feel for his difficulties. I know his life, it was... It was not easy, but this, this... This bullshit worker comp claim... He never filed an injury report while he was working here? [Ibrahim] No! What happens is this: Mhm. Come winter time, when things are slow, we have to lay people off. Sometimes we lay people off who have worked here longer than Manual. But then, we hire them back. Sometimes in summertime, when work is good. But Manuel, he cannot sustain himself, I think. He begs me not to fire him. But there is nothing I can do. So, a week after we let him go, we get a letter from attorney saying he has all these personal injuries, and I think, what the hell, you know? No one see him get hurt. He never tell nobody he get hurt. And now suddenly he claim he cannot work without a cane. Yes, look. [Ibrahim] He says, "Cumulative trauma since 2007." He work here every single day, never miss one. [Ray] Gee, the's crazy. I know it is crazy, and you know what is more crazy? After, I tell him about attorney letter. Manuel call me on cellphone. And he beg me to give him his job back. He say, "Mr. Kozlov," "I will be evicted from apartment." He say that is why he has filed the claim. Not because he is injured. Listen, Mr. Brey. I own this warehouse for 36 years. People get injured. It is a warehouse. These things happen. But this astronomical worker compensation premiums, they are my second biggest expense after payroll. [laughs] Yeah! I pay employee's medical bills, but this... This Manuel Macias... This lying motherfucker! He never get hurt. He just want money. [Ray] I hear ya, sir. [Ibrahim sighs] I feel for him, truly. I do. But these phony claims, they push my rates up too much. And if I pay every lying motherfucker, then I have to close the door, and if I close the doors, what happen? 259 men lose their jobs. 259 Manuel Macias. Then you pretty fucking busy, huh? [Ray chuckles] True that. [Joe clears throat] [Ray sighs] I got that video from Thursday ID'ed. It is Macias. Macias. Macias. I met the insured. Nice Russian Guy. He owns a warehouse down in Downey. I hope I get something good for him, you know. Why? Oh, cuz Macias is full of shit, that's why. [Joe] Well, so? What do you care? You save some rich guy a few bucks? Ruin some poor wetback's life? Okay, um... But you know, if he's seriously injured, then I... [Joe] Well yeah, but then what? He gets paid, he calls his co-workers, Pablo, Rogelio, and Oscar, he refers them to his scheisser lawyer and some fucking chiropractor on Wilshire who'll diagnose all of them with, um, soft-tissue injuries? Your friend, the insured, closes doors. Nobody wins. No matter what you do, you get film, you don't get film. Nobody wins. That can be a new slogan for this company. I should email Chuck. It's cool. What's all this? What're you working on? - [Joe] Saleh Saleh. - [Ray] The hell is that? [Joe] That, my boy, is the elusive white whale. I had a Saleh Saleh case open in 2004. He was a driver for one of the studios. Got blindsided by a semi on the 405. Filed for complete disability. Seven figure settlement. Bilateral, lumbar, CT, anxiety, sexual dysfunction... the whole nine yards. Insurance company got suspicious when an ex-coworker said that he spotted Saleh at a gym in Van Nuys. Yeah. Yeah, this is the only video I ever got back on him. He's outside a deposition, back in '05. Since then, the carrier has spent probably, 50,000 dollars on surveillance. And not a damn thing has shown up. - Ten? - Ten years. No social media. No, um... No credit cards, no social security number, no car. He's got a PO box, but nobody's ever seen him there. But I've actually seen him twice when I wasn't working. Once, in 2010, driving an unmarked Mercedes up in Sylmar. And the second time on TV. - [Ray] On TV? - Yeah! Sitting three rows back at a Laker's game. So you think he's still in LA? Oh, I know he is. Is that why he's up on the monitor now? - Did the case get reopened? - Yeah. For what has to be the thousandth time. He's got a medical appointment on Wednesday. They want a two man team. One guy in the lobby, one guy outside in the car. Would you be available? Sure. [Ray] Have you ever done a medical before? No, uh, not that I, uh... [Joe] You ever done a two man? No. You'll be fine. He won't show up, anyway. [chuckles] [Ray] Sweet. [Joe sighs] All that maddens and torments. All that stirs up the lees of things. [intense music] [knocking] So, I spoke to Earl. We talked to a couple of our ex-coworkers, they're uncertain but they said she used to do a yoga class in Silverlake on Wednesday nights. Now, they didn't know the time or place or anything, so I'm gonna have you back out there tomorrow, starting round noon. And you can stick around into the evening, and see if she goes to this class. Alright. Have you used the hidden camera yet? No, not yet. Alright. I'll have Joe show how they work. Hidden cameras are the longest running joke in this industry. It all started with this fucking monstrosity. Jesus. [Joe scoffs] Half the time, it took video upside-down when it worked at all. Didn't have a date-time stamp on it so it wasn't even admissible in court, anyway. And then it evolved into all of these. Hat camera, tie camera, pen camera, water-bottle camera. They all came from China, nobody could understand the instructions, and they didn't work. - What the fuck is this? - The um... Rock camera. [phone ringing] Who the fuck uses a rock camera, man? I have no idea. [Joe] Well, things are better nowadays. Voila. [clears throat] You just take this, point it, and record. You push the top button to turn it on. Push it again to record, and you push the bottom to turn it off. [Ray] This is so sick. [ethereal jazzy music] [car starting up] [ticking noise] Fuck. [exhales] [woman] Hi! First time? Yeah. First time here, or first time ever doing yoga? Yeah. [laughs] Alright, well, just don't push yourself too hard, okay? Listen to your body, if it's uncomfortable, you just push yourself a little bit, but not to the point of pain. - Alright? - Thanks. Cuz I'm pretty inflexible, so... Well, saying you can't do yoga cuz you're not flexible is like saying you can't drink water because you're too thirsty! [laughs softly] Oh, I'm Wendy. If you need anything. I'm R... - Rick. - Nice to meet you Rick. [Wendy] And on an inhale, raise those hands up into the air, over your head, in a simple back extension on an exhale. Fall forward into a full forward bend. Breathe into those hamstrings. And if your body allows it, clasp the elbows, and gently rock back and forth. And on an exhale, I want you to either jump or step back to a plank. Make your way into Chaturanga. You're going to keep your elbows facing inwards and up into an upward facing dog. We're gonna lift the spine up out of the pelvis to create space between the vertebrae. And really just focus on your breath here. A really deep child's pose. Breathe into the hips. Arms straight in front of you. Yoga is the best way to prevent injury if you're very active. If you play sports? - I don't, no. - Oh, well. All the more reason to practice regularly. You spend too much time sedentary, your body starts to compress. [laughs awkwardly] - Bye, Wendy. - Bye! [Wendy] What do you do for a living, Rick? [suspenseful music] [Ray sighs] Is this the hidden camera video of Morgan? Yep. - You know it's utterly unusable. - I know. Well, it's okay kid. At least you know how to turn it on. Yeah, thanks Joe. Ray. Don't beat yourself up over this. You see these worker's comps, attorneys, they have what they call, "the good day defence". You gotta have repeated activity over a long period of time to even hope for a reduction in benefits, let alone a dismissal. Let alone a fucking prosecution in this state of communist California. - What is she's lying? - So what? Good for her. How else is she gonna survive? She saw an opportunity and she took it. [Ray] It wouldn't be right, Joe. What... You know, Ray, when you're a single mom with no college education, then I'll listen to you tell me what is wrong and what is right. Yeah well, I didn't go to college either, Joe! Look at me, I'm here. I'm in this shithole. I'm making a paycheck. Because you're a fucking sucker. - That's why. - Well, so are you! You're goddamn right, I am. But I have accepted... the pointlessness of my non-existence. I have accepted that this is who I am, that all I ever will be. Everyday is... the best day of my life and the worst day of my life. You should quit, Ray. Unless this is what you want. Look at me, Ray! I am your fucking endgame! This is where you will end up! [ethereal jazz music] [Ray] Hey. So, I just go in the waiting room? [Joe] You think you just might possibly manage that? I mean... Yeah. What if they ask me why I'm there? [Joe] It's a waiting room. You're waiting for someone. Alright. Okay. Well, who am I waiting for? [Joe] Who fucking cares? [Joe] So, we stay till 3, and then we call it a day. Okay, yeah. Sounds good. [Joe] Hey Ray. You ever heard of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch? Um... Is that a heavy metal band? [Joe] It's a floating island of trash somewhere between the U.S and Asia. Miles in diameter. Made of plastic shit people have thrown away. When the plastic decomposes, it turns into toxic sludge, which ends up in the digestive system of millions of sea animals. The funniest thing about the island, is that because it's literally in the middle of the ocean, no country wants to take responsibility for it. So it just gets bigger and bigger everyday. - Wait a sec. - [Joe] What? - I think I saw him. - [Joe] Saleh? Yeah. He was leaving, not coming though. [Joe] It's only 1:15, there's no chance it was him. But it was him, Joe. [Joe] If you really think you saw him, go check the sign-in sheet. Hi. Shit. I'm sure it was fucking him. [suspenseful music] [elevator buzzes] Come on. Shit. Fuck. He's in the garage. He's getting in his car. [Joe] You need to see what car he gets into. It's a Jaguar. Newer model. Gray. [Joe] Plate? It's got a dealer plates on it. Gray as well. So... [Joe] Get your ass back down here. I can't believe he showed up. The white fucking whale! You're finally gonna get him, Joe! [panting] I'm so glad I'm with you on this, cuz, tailing is definitely not one of my strong suits, you know. I feel like it makes me uncertain about it all and shit. I never know how far or how close I need to be when I'm tailing. But I'm good at the pretexting and stuff, but shit! Joe, I know this though. If it were me tailing him right now, and I was this far away, I'd probably lose him. You might wanna get a little closer. [shouts] Shut up! Sorry Joe, I'm a little high right now, you know. What? I mean, I'm really nervous. Well, don't be. [Joe] God, what the fuck is this? [Joe] Come on! [car honks] [Ray] God, what the fuck! Nah, man. There's a fucking dog on the street. What? Yeah, there's a fucking dog in the street blocking traffic. [cars beeping] [Joe] Wait here. [Ray] Joe, what the fuck are you doing? [sternly] Wait here. [distant barking] [Ray] Damn it! [honking and beeping continue] [Ray] Oh god. Joe! What are you doing? [dog whimpering] [Ray] Don't put the dog in here, man! What the fuck! Dude, what the fuck is with the dog in the car, man! - What if he bites? - He doesn't! [Ray] How do you know? We're gonna lose him, Joe! What the fuck! [Ray] You know, I know I'm new at this whole thing, but, I mean I'm really confused, Joe. I mean, I think we might've had a lot of attention drawn on us. We could've easily have lost him. [Joe] Yeah. Maybe. I mean, this is a stray fucking dog. There's millions of them in this area. Would you shut the fuck up? Listen to me, you little shit. We need to get something straight, right now. Pat told me to show you the ropes, and I am. But you need to understand that I hate this fucking job. I hate driving in this car. I hate the people I work with. I hate tailing. I hate this fucking city. I hate everyone in it. And I hate you! If I don't get video on a case, I feel like shit. And then even when I do get video, I feel even shittier. I make shit money. Living in this little fucking apartment in North Hollywood, next to some drug dealing nigger, and some dumbass bitch from Ohio who thinks she's gonna make it as a movie star. Jesus. I got no college education. I got no family. What I got is high blood pressure. They have me on this fucking Hydroton for years and now I'm on Dyazide, and if I don't take it, I feel like shit everyday. I'll tell you something. I have been on the Saleh case for ten years. Ten years! And we may have lost him back there, but I don't really give a good goddamn. Let that camel jockey milk the system. Let Powell Insurance's stock drop a millionth of a point. Who really cares? But look! Look! This is a living creature. He's scared. He's hungry. He's alone. And by god, I'm gonna save his life. What else really matters? Eat it! I mean, it was just the latest in a series of strange events that's been happening in my life, you know. [Ross] Totally. Then, what happened last week at rustic... I started doubting everything. Like, reality. I felt very certain. [sticker noises] [sighs] And then the shit with my mom... I'm really stressed out, man. [Ross] Yeah. Like, Joe... Shit, it's like, how's he even possible? A guy like that? How does he even exist? He's really racist. That's fucked up, man. I mean, he's racist towards everyone. [mumbles] Like, I don't think his hatred [stammers] even has a specific direction, you know? [Ross] Still, I mean... He goes on these crazy-ass rants... I dunno. [phone vibrating] [Ray] What? - [Ross] What? Who is it? - [Ray] It's him! It's Joe! Answer, bro! Put it on speaker. - [Ray] No... - Dude, answer it! I wanna hear him. - Alright. - Dude, I won't say a word. - Hey Joe. - [Joe] Hi Ray. What's up, man? Everything cool? [Joe] Nothing's cool. [silent laughing] Yeah? Hey, how did it go with the dog? [Joe] Well, he's good, I think. I had to take him all the way down to Anaheim. One of the only no-kill shelters in the area. He had fleas. Was a little malnourished. But no diseases or anything. I think there's a good chance he'll get adopted. I hope so. I paid to have him groomed. [exhales slowly] Well, that's really good of you, man. Uh, I really think someone is gonna snatch him up. Yeah. [Joe] Sometimes, when I'm sitting in the traffic on the 5, I close my eyes. I feel the heat. I listen to the wind outside my car. And I imagine I am in the Sargasso Sea. You know what that is? In ancient times, there was an area of the ocean where seaweed grew tall and thick, and boats were sail through it and get snared. There's no way out. The crew would then, starve to death, and the boats would just stay there, unmanned... Unmanned... that's pretty deep, man. [Joe] I think about what all of this was before humans came and ruined this valley. I watched birds fly through the sky that bleeds acid raid. Tree roots bulge up under the sidewalks we've laid, ruining the foundations of the shitty little houses we built. That's the only time I feel anything other than despair. You should stop smoking weed, Ray. Huh? [Joe] Doing this job, it'll make you paranoid enough. Okay, well... [chuckles] Alright, Joe. [Joe] Have a nice weekend, Ray. - Yeah, you too, man. - [Joe] See you Monday. [Ross] The fuck? [ethereal jazz music] [woman] I'm just saying that you have to have real food. - [girl] Okay. - [woman] Okay! [giggles] [woman] Do you wanna be that annoying? [distant talking] That Morgan? What? Did you finally get something on her? Um, no. No, this is just the ID photo they sent, you know. You know, you do this job long enough, you start to feel like a pervert. [Joe] Kinda a funny phenomenon, actually. But all the sneaking around, the lying, spying on people... That's all for a good cause, supposedly. But there's something that we do, what our bodies do... [Joe] Our bodies listen to our minds, But I think the opposite is true too. [exclaims] That's why all these actors and actresses' marriages fall apart. They spend all day, pretending to kiss people, pretending to fuck, pretending to be in love, and then one day... [balloon deflating noise] [intense jazzy music] [sighs loudly] Ugh, shit. - [Joe] Yeah? - Hey, Joe. [chuckles] I'm on the Colleen Morgan case. I've [stammers] I've been here since seven. [sniffs] Um, her car is here. I think she's home. Um... [inhales slowly] Look, um... I gotta take a shit, man. What do I do? [Joe] Go shit. - In my car? - [Joe] No! Go shit, man. Like, go somewhere, and shit. - Like, a bathroom. - Okay, go to a bathroom. Where? [Joe] Haven't I taught you about shitting yet? No. [Joe] Well, if you gotta shit, be a man and do what you can. A lot of it depends on the area and the day. When you're desperate and have no other option, the last resort is a gas-station. You want to avoid diners and cheap restaurants too. They're usually small, dirty, and crowded. The worst ones have serious gap issues. [scoffs] Gap issues? [Joe] The walls of the stall aren't set together properly, so when someone comes in, they're looking you right in the eyes while you shit. [laughs] Oh yeah. I hate that, man. [Joe] Yeah, everybody does. Beware of the walls of the stalls. What you want is a Starbucks. Now, that's the gold standard of shitting. When it's very late, or very early, or if there's no Starbucks around, one of my favorite shitting locations is a motel lobby. No questions. Usually empty. Usually clean. Well, those are your options though. Well, I saw a coffee shop on the way in here, so... I'm gonna take a shit there. Thanks. [upbeat electronic music] [flushing noises] [Pat] You work Morgan today? [Ray] Yeah. - [Pat] And? - Nothing yet. [Pat] Well... [coughs] Maybe I should get Joe on it, he might be able to make something happen. No, no! It's fine. I can... [stammers] I got this. I can handle it. I just... [sighs] I know she's fucking home, I just need her to do something, you know what I mean? - You do a pretext? - Yeah. - Anything? - Nada. She didn't answer. [Pat sighs] But, I know she's home. Well, we gotta get something on her. I talked to Juan today at Aegis. They want to deny her claim. She's supposed to be unable to raise her arms above her shoulders. She's got a young daughter too... Well, they think she's gotta be lifting the kid. Well, I'll talk to Juan again. See if he has anything else on her that'll help. - Hey! Joe. - Pat. You gotta stop the coffee, man. It's terrible for you. [Pat] You smell like cigarettes. Are you smoking again? I never quit. [Pat] Uh-huh. This fucking guy. [Pat] He'll have a heart attack. Drop dead. Then he'll be happy. Did you know that I trained him? - Really? - Yeah, just like you. That's what you got to look forward to one day. [Ray chuckles] [cracking noise] [distant police sirens] [sighs] I want you to visualize perfection. For yourself. [Wendy] And for everyone around you. I want you to visualize a white light, coursing through your body. Hold it in your hand, and pass it off to your neighbor. Live in it together. Are you okay? Yeah, I am. I'm fine. [girl] Mommy! [exclaims] You are so heavy! [laughs] - [woman] Ready to go? - [girl] Yeah. - [girl] Can we get pizza? - [woman] Duh! [girl] And donuts? [typing noises] [Joe] Oh, there you are. - This yours? - Yeah, one of them. - This is Shelly. - Nice to meet you, Shelly. So, wait. They don't care that you [stammers] bring your dog to work on the weekends? [Joe coughs] Jesus, you alright, Joe? [Joe] God, who knows? Can you believe I used to be a half decent athlete? Really? I used to play basketball at the YMCA in Hollywood. I blocked Stan Brundy's shot once. You know who that is? No. [chuckles] I don't really follow sports much. Oh. [hesitates] I dunno. I'm too scared to even jog now. Afraid I'll have a heart attack, fall down on the side walk dead! I don't really think that happens very much, Joe. Sure it does. The silent killer... they call it. Yeah... Well... my dad's got high pressure. But he's still alive, the prick! Lives way out there, in Riverside. That wasteland suburb of serial killers, meth heads and... other assorted and sundry highway trash. He smokes, he drinks, he doesn't take care of himself. But he's still kicking... the bastard! Damn! [Joe] Oh well... how's that Morgan case? I'll say it's um... uneventful. Hey, how's Saleh Saleh? Well, he's vanished into the mists again! He's not at that house we tailed him to. Fucking prick! [Joe coughs] Fuck! [Joe] Oh well... [mobile phone ringing] Hello. Yeah. Alright, okay. [inaudible voices muttering] [laughing] [Pat] There's Ray. Come in. What part of "look presentable" did you not understand? [Ray] I uh... did... my best. [Pat] Right... right. Hat! Fortunately for you... Earl and Juan, are old friends of mine so... they don't really give a shit. [Pat] Earl, Juan, the new guy, Ray. [Juan] How you doing Ray. Still don't know why Joe isn't in on this? Well Joe is still... tied up on Saleh Saleh. Saleh Saleh! Fuck me... that case is still going? [Pat] The guy is a fucking cockroach, what do you want me to tell you? [Earl claps] Speaking of which... Earl and Juan are seeing the case managers, of Aegis who are overseeing the Morgan case. I think I told you that they're gonna want a briefing, on the investigation so far. Right, um... well... uh ha. Honestly, I really don't have anything on her yet. Well that's okay... I mean... plenty of time. She's a real piece of work, Colleen Morgan. [Juan] You know, she's got a history of claims, going back almost a decade. She got a pattern. Getting hired and getting fired. Hitting her employer post term with everything under the sun. From uh... soft tissue crap to... anxiety from sexual harassment... [chuckles] You know... I remember when her ass was two words... [all laughing] [Juan] Yeah. Have you seen her yet Ray? Ms Morgan her ass... it's really good! [Ray] Huh! That's a good thing to know... This bitch is doing yoga! We just know it! Maybe other shit too... Maybe... uh, pilates? [Juan] We get her doing just anything, it'll help us with our settlement. Cause she's saying with the anxiety, she's got... sexual dysfunction. Oh, hey Ray. Could you fuck her? And then video it? Just for use as ...evidence in the deposition of course. Juan... I think, that might be entrapment. Alright, maybe just a blow job then... [all laughing] In all seriousness though Ray... don't have any contact with her at all. [Earl] Not that we need to mention that obviously. Obviously. [Earl] Her attorney is Don Kerrigan. And that fucking vulture will use anything. [Earl] You ever had to testify Ray? No... uh... [Ray] not yet. I... um... I... I gave video to a lawyer once. Um, but the case went to settlement, before I was actually needed. Well hopefully this won't come to that. Cause Kerrigan... will tear you a new one! Anyway, you've been on her a week right so uh... what you got so far? What? No. You guys don't understand. Well... what do you want me to do? I mean you guys ain't gonna do that and I appreciate it, but... what if she... um... Oh, okay, so it falls on my shoulders then. I don't have any credit cards. I don't think I'd qualify. Crowd sourcing, what the fuck is that? I don't think that's going to be an option for me. Right. I mean, that'll help, I guess, but the thing is... it's not that I can't afford that bill... it's that I cant afford ANY bill. [tense music] [Colleen] Hey, can I have another please. Thank you. Hey. Howdy. You're Colleen Morgan right? Do I know you? No. No. Okay. [laughs] I wanna talk to you about your disability case. Excuse me. I'm a private investigator. I was hired by Aegis insurance company, to do surveillance on you. What? To get evidence. To show that you're not really injured. Okay, get the fuck away from me. No. I wanna help you. I'm calling my lawyer. Colleen, please, look. I can get in a ton of trouble for this. But I actually want to help you. It's just a huge fucking risk! [Colleen] is this really the best time? Maybe not... but, I know that this place... none of the people I work with come here. Okay... um... can you just like... give me a second. Oh yeah, absolutely. [bar music and background chatting] Can I have another one of these please. You know what, make it two... one. Just one. [Ray] This is a great idea, I think... I don't see why it wouldn't work. Yeah, I don't know. It feels really shady to me... Well I been doing surveillance on you for over a month now, your case it's... it's bullshit. Yeah well. I don't need your help. [Ray] I've been on you... I've seen you. You're not hurt. Maybe you are... but not... like you're claiming to be. Kerrigan says our case looks solid. This is makes it more than solid. it's un-losable. There's nothing Kerrigan can present, that can help you more than me. I mean, I'm hired by the other side, to gather evidence. You understand? How do you not get it? You have the power here. You know, you can call Kerrigan at any point Stop all this, you know. I can't tell anyone about it. I'm the one who proposed it, you can deny everything, I'd be fucked. Why would you do this then if it's so risky for you? I need money. There's other ways to get money. Clearly. [Colleen] Okay. Well then, just do what I did. And file a worker's comp claim. I haven't been with the company long enough. What do you need the money for? My mom... she's... she's sick. No insurance. Okay, so if we tried this... I can shut it down at any time? Yeah! I mean at any point you can call Kerrigan. Call it off. Here's the thing... they'll just put another investigator on you. Sooner or later you'd slip up. And again your case would be fucked. If we do this... and we go this route, we do it right, and we're careful. I promise, everybody wins. Everybody except Aegis insurance. Yeah well, fuck those guys. I was there a few days ago with them, they don't give a shit about you. [sighs] In fact they told me to be careful with this case, not to make any contact with you. Alright. - Alright? - I'm not saying yes but... If I did. What'll we do? [Ray] Well uh... simple. You'd do what you normally do. [Ray] Well, you know, do what you'd normally do, if you were actually injured. Cause ah... you know, for this to work... for them to buy in... it's gotta be a lot... like, over a period of weeks... maybe even months, different times of day, different days of the week. [softly talking to daughter] [Ray] Then you know... keep going you know. Um... they'll... they'll keep asking me for some footage, Video and stuff. I'll give them footage of you, and they'll see that you're hurt. And then they'll have to close the case. It'll go to... depositions and what not... and they'll have to settle. Hopefully you'll get close to what you're asking for. And you'll get 10 per cent? It's just a small price to pay. [chuckles] [gentle traffic noise] - Hey. - Hey Oh... so this is how it looks on the inside. [laughing] Um... let me get you a drink. Yeah, sure. [door closes] [beeping of video game] Oh, thank you. [Ray] So... uh... where's Casey's dad? Not here. [Ray] Oh. I... you know, my dad abandoned me when I was a kid too... Okay, maybe we can talk about something else. Right, I'm sorry. It's cool. [to himself] Shit! [pots clattering] Do you like meatballs? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Do you? No, I'm a vegetarian. [Colleen] The hell you are! You said "hell"! [gasps] The "heck" you are! [Ray] You really didn't have to... You're right, I wanted to. I really appreciate you helping me. You're helping my mom? [Colleen] Yes! Ray is helping me. [Casey] What are you helping with? Art projects? [Colleen] Exactly. [chuckles] Can I see it? [Colleen] When it's done - [Casey] Okay. - Okay [giggles] That is seriously gross! [chuckles] [Colleen laughing] Oh my god what do you do if you have to poop? What? Yeah, what do you do? Do you get like a bag? I don't poop in a fucking bag! I'm not an animal! What would a girl do if she had to pee? I don't know! You tell me. [Colleen] Pee in a cup! You know... sometimes life takes some... weird... turns Yeah. I do appreciate what you're doing for me. I mean I know you're doing it for your mom... and the money and... I'm doing it cause I think you're a good person. Am I? [chuckles] [Colleen giggles] Yeah! Yeah? Thanks! [chuckles] [ominous music] [telephone ringing] Have you ever been married Joe? Yeah, once. Yeah? What happened? Well... you really wanna know? I was fucking around on her. Oh, shit. [Joe] To this day, I don't even know why. The one woman on this planet, that could stand me. And I wasn't even unhappy. [Pat] Ray! Hey Pat. Still nothing on Morgan? Nah, just um... just more of the same, you know. She's really messed up. Fuck! This bill is going to be enormous! Ray, we gotta get something on her. I just point the camera... I can't control what it gets. Fuck! [Joe] Would you like some help on this case? No. I mean, nothing I can't handle. Suit yourself. Can I buy you lunch? So? I think, it's the dumbest fucking thing that anyone has ever done! I oughta go up there and tell Pat right now. You'd be royally fucked. Yeah, I know. [Joe sighs] [Joe huffing] Oh shit! [Joe muttering] Tell you the truth, I've actually thought of doing it myself a few times! Wait! You thought of it... so why didn't you do it then? Were you scared you were gonna be caught? No, of course not. [sighs] I just don't trust anyone. Ah. [Joe] Like this chick... do you really think... that she's gonna pay you... after she gets her hot little hands on that cheque? I trust her, Joe. You don't know a goddam thing about her... Are you kidding me... I've... I've been watching her every single day. I looked her up on line, she has no criminal record. I trust her, okay? You stupid idiot! You know what, you just jealous that I actually had the balls... to do it. [Joe chuckles] You probably right. [Ray] Joe...? [Joe gagging] You alright? Scared me there for a minute. Just a little gas, that's all. Jesus Christ man! - You scared the shit out of me! - [Joe] Yeah [soft knocking] [Colleen distant] It's open! [Ray] Where's uh, where's Casey? She'll be here soon. She's with Jules. [Ray] Alright? [Colleen] I had to meet with Kerrigan today. Which is why I'm just getting home. [Ray soft gasp] Huh! Okay. [Colleen] I fucking hate getting dressed up! [Ray] Yeah... um... me too. [Colleen] Hey, why don't you cut open that wine? [Ray] You going to have some wine? [Colleen] Hah yes! [Ray chuckles] Okay. [Colleen] No more okay! Mommy has company... seriously stop! [Casey] But I don't feel good! [Colleen] I understand. That's why you need to go to sleep, okay. Sleep makes you feel better. [Colleen] Aaah! Christ, I'm sorry! No, it's fine! So... um... I was thinking. What if... What if Aegis just decides to pretend, that the videos we are making don't exist? Usually doesn't work like that. It's kinda like the legal system. Innocent until proven guilty. I mean, you're injured because you're claiming to be, until proven otherwise. [Casey] Mommy! Oh my god... No it's fine! Excuse me. [piano music] [Colleen] Aaah my god! Fuuck! That took forever! That's fine, seriously. I'm so sorry. Don't worry about it. I need more of that! Cheers! Cheers! So you're going to get a lot of money. [Colleen giggles] What are you going to do with it? - [Colleen gasps] [Ray] You going to buy a house? Yeah, I don't know... maybe. Yeah, move somewhere with a yard. I was thinking the other day... this is a big gamble. For me, I mean... like what we're doing, it's gonna mean I win my case in all likelihood. But it also means that... even though you... would get in trouble. You could... fuck me. - Uh! What? - [Colleen laughing nervously] over... you could fuck me over! I want to die! No it's fine! Ssssh! Shut up! If you wake up Casey, I will seriously kill you! I'm glad I me you Ray Brey. I'm glad I spied on you. You know, you could have really hurt me. Doing your job... getting video of me. If there was anyone else assigned to my case, I'd be in trouble. But it wasn't. No. Oh shit! Hey! Shouldn't we... um... shouldn't we go to the bedroom? No, Casey's in there. She wanted to sleep in my bed. Oh, couch it is then. [Colleen whispers] No! No! [laughs] Ray! It's been a long time for me. Right. Um... I'm sorry It's okay. You sure? Yeah. [Ray] I don't know for certain, I mean... ah... I think... ah... right... I don't know... exactly when. Soon, I think. They... I mean, I could... give you guys a call back next week. Okay. I got it. No, no, I'm sorry...[unintelligible] I mean next week I think I'll be able to cut it all back. Okay. Okay. You doing the Morgan report? Yip [Pat sighs] What a cluster fuck! Hey... those guys over at Aegis... they not pissed off, are they? Nah, I mean, the bitch is injured so they going to pay. They've already reached out asking for a settlement, way more than they wanted to pay. Probably close to what she wanted. Probably high six figures, at least Oh. Good for her. Seriously! Have you spoken to Joe? No? When I don't hear from that self destructive motherfucker, I start to worry. Gah! I'm sure he's fine! - Yeah - [Pat] Yeah. You know, I'm really worried about Joe. He doesn't disappear like this. Maybe he moved o the trash island. [Art chuckles] He's got health issues man... high blood pressure. Well, he's self-destructed. Yeah, I hope he's alright. I'm sure he's fine. [Ray] This chick, she... hasn't texted me back either. [Art] The insurance scam chick? You haven't told anyone about that have you? Of course not, I mean... who would I even tell? No one. I'd be fucked! I know! Huh... but you're being careful like you said. And... at this point she's in it just as much as you are... so I'm sure she'd be just as screwed. No dude! She wouldn't be! Alright man, she's probably just dealing with the whole settlement thing. I mean, it's like... imminent. Now... right? Yeah!... I guess. Well, I hope it works out man... you know like... the whole thing with your mom's fucked. Me too. Did you sign a contract or something? No, I didn't have her sign a contract. [Art chuckles] Yeah, I guess you could not have done that. I dunno man... like... I'm sure it'll be fine. Me too. Hey... Uh... Morning Sir... I was wondering... I was calling... on the uh... Colleen Morgan case. Uh... did you get my report? I mean I sent it to you guys a couple of weeks ago Yeah, totally, you know, I mean... I wish I could get something better for you guys, something a little more useful. Alright so it's over then? Did she settle? Alright. Wow! How much did she get? Seriously... hmm. [tense music builds] Fuck me! Colleen! Hey man! She moved. What? The moving truck was here this weekend. But no! I... uh... Do you, do you, know where she was going? No... she didn't say. She was here with her husband, they loaded up... - Wait... her husband! - Hmm... I thought it was her husband, but... Maybe it was her brother. Thanks. [sighs] Ray. Hey Pat You hear about Joe? What? No. I mean, I've been trying to reach him, but he hasn't been answering. Is he okay? I told him! I fucking told him... that he's gotta start taking care of himself, or something like this is gonna happen. What happened? [Joe coughing] [Ray knocking] Fuck off! [Joe groans] [Joe] What do you want? [Ray] Jesus Christ, Joe! A fucking heart attack man! What the fuck! These doctors are a bunch of ass holes! They keep hounding me, about what I should have done differently. There's a lot I should have done differently! I know that! But here I am! Well... I'm really sorry Joe... You know I believe in God? I didn't always. Always seemed like an idea that was so improbable... then something happened. What happened? Well... a case I had a couple of years back... guy named Crespo... [sighs] I got dragged to this party... By a... guy I knew. We were working on this, business venture we were trying to get started. So... we go to this party, we meet... this rich guy... Crespo. And I'm telling him about our idea... And he gets really interested, and says... Yeah, well it's an interesting idea. I'd love to hear more about it. [Joe] So we exchanged business cards, and um... the next week... we went out for lunch and... he really seemed interested. One day... I'm on a call, with Olivier... heading into the office. He loved our business plan, he's jacked up about it. We thought he was really ready to cut a cheque. So I go into my office... walk to my desk... while I'm talking to him, and I looked down, on my desk, there is this new case file... and it says Olivier... Crespo! Nah! You got to be kidding me! No. So there were two guys with the same name? [Joe] No. It was the same guy. He was a coiner. There was some telemarketing firm he worked for. All his rich guy shit was all bullshit! But that's not the point. The point is... I was talking to him on the phone... and there on my desk... is a case file with his name on it! Fuck! What did you do? I just... I was in such shock I just hung up. That's almost too incredible to be true. [piano music] Joe... if there's anything you want me to do... What do? My dogs. I'm worried about my dogs. [Joe groaning] Maybe you could check on them? Yeah. Absolutely. I... I... I talked to my neighbor, the nigger... he'll watch them, they'll be okay until I get home. I don't know when I'll get back. I don't know. [dramatic music] [music builds] [laughing] I'm going to go to the bathroom. [tense music] [Joe] Husband? I'm sorry, Ray. Thought he was gone? [Colleen] He was. We were separated, but not divorced. Did he come back before or... or after the settlement? Well that... the case is still ongoing No it's not! Jesus Christ! Fuck! I should have listened to Joe! What? [Ray whispering] Goddammit! You didn't tell someone what happened, did you? [Colleen] You didn't tell anyone what we did? You couldn't be that fucking stupid! Relax. Joe's not going to say anything. Yeah, well he fucking better not! [Colleen] If anyone finds out... anyone. I'm going to say you forced me to do it. I'm going to say, it was all your idea. Well... it was my idea. And I'm going to say that you raped me. [traffic noise] Wow! [Ray] So my ten percent... you not going to pay me shit are you? [fist thumps] Huh! Yeah, I really needed that money. I don't know what I'm going to do about my mom! I have my own family... Ray I'm sorry. [Colleen] If you say anything to anyone. I will seriously ruin your life. [Ray] Oh, what can you do? Let it go. [dramatic music] [music builds] [male voice singing]
