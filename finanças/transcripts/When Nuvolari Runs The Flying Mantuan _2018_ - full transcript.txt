When Nuvolari races, when Nuvolari passes by, a bunch of people show up and lay down on the lawns. When Nuvolari races, when Nuvolari passes by people wait for his arrival, for hours and hours... Sooner or later you’ll get hurt, Tazio... I wanted to see how fast I could get to uncle’s house. Do your homework! Don’t waste time with that like your father! I am faster than Tazio Nuvolari! THE FERRARI HOOK FOUND IS BASED ON THE NOVEL PUBLISHED BY GIORGIO NADA IN 2006 - Hi Grandpa! - Here you are! - Why are you so sweaty? - I ran with my bike! - Can we see it again? - Of course, we’ll see it later. By the way, I made up my mind! It’s been hidden in my barn for more than 60 years I'll take it back to Mantua. - Are you sure? Absolutely! Sit down so I keep telling you about Nuvolari! Who at my age already used to speed on his bicycle! Of course, his father used to do races, so his destiny was sealed. - Was he talented? - His father Arturo? You bet he was! He started as an amateur, winning the Italian Championship on road while his uncle Giuseppe was Italian Champion on track! And he gave Tazio his first bicycle, that he used to get to school. Artura, Tazio’s sister, that day was invited to a ball... Oh my gosh, the shoemaker hasn’t brought my shoes yet! It’s late! I’ll miss the party! - So put on other shoes! - Are you crazy, Tazio? I can only wear those shoes on this dress! He’s not coming, he’s not coming! - I’ll go get them. - In Mantua? How? By uncle Giuseppe’s motorcycle! Hey kid, can I see your license and registration? This bike belongs to my uncle, he asked me to take it back to home. How? - Pushing it! - Well... let’s go, I’ll come with you! Hey, slow down! I’ll remember your face! Some years later, the officer read on a newspaper that Nuvolari had won his first race and told the journalist about that event... The traffic officer was astonished about it, and he told everyone in Mantua that traffic officer was him. But no one believed him. Many people were looking for it... I’ve always been afraid one day they’d come to me. Luckily they never did. Push it off! Let it pop off! No! Perhaps we can block it. I’ve kept it as my greatest secret! Do we take it? That’s stealing! They’d look for it! Well, I’ll take it! Go away you chickens! And don’t rat on me or I’ll beat you up! - What’s wrong grandpa? - I'm not crying. I’m happy! This hood brought me luck, do you know why? - Why? - Thanks to it I met Grandma Sterina Do you need some help? - So what will you do with it? - Don't know. You know who belongs to? The great Tazio Nuvolari! - Who? Someone who raced today? - Yes! Your t-shirt is so dirty! Shortly before I got him a coffee. But he spat it on me. - Who? - Him! Nuvolari! He stopped to refuel so I got him a coffee. He was nice to thank you like that! - Unluckily the coffee was hot. - You’re funny! Hoods’ thief! Grandma Sterina was so beautiful! I’ve never met her! She went one year before you were born. - Who is this child she’s holding? - Your mother! She was just born Grandpa, Is Grandma Sterina watching us now? Of course! She told me to bring the Nuvolari’s hood back to Mantua! - Did Nuvolari have a girlfriend? - Naturally! Her name was Carolina they loved each other for their entire life. - Whose is it? - My uncle Giuseppe's. It’s beautiful! If you take off your mask, I can see you too! That’s me! Am I ugly? No! You are prettier than I thought! - My name is Tazio. - I’m Carolina. - I’ve never been on a bike. - Do you want to take a ride? Are you crazy? We’ll be in trouble and you're too young to drive it! Are you coming? - C’mon hop in! - You drive slow? Of course! - You drive too fast! - Were you scared? Just a little bit. When my uncle brought me to a motorcycle racing - I made my choice... - What choice? - I do want to race! - You’re out of your mind! Perhaps you’re right! Come, lay down next to me How I would fly like a bird! But you have no wings! And they’ve been engaged since then? Yes even if, after that stunt on the bike, Carolina’s parents didn’t like Tazio, so they forbade them from seeing each other. But Tazio and Carolina kept seeing secretly, when they could. Tazio! Is your father’s car? - Yes it is! - He knows you got it? - No, he doesn’t... - What are you going to do? Jump in! I want to run away with you. My father could kill me for that Your parents must accept we’re in love. - I’m afraid. - Do you trust me? - I do. - Come with me. They may have noticed we run away by now I can imagine the tears of my mother and the screams of my father. And my father promising your father he will break my face. And my father saying He’d kill you first, if you’ve touched me. And my father promising he will force me to marry you. - And what will you do? - I’ll marry you. - How will we live? - I'll race, win and we’ll be rich. Bike racing are dangerous and I am afraid... ...you could fall off and die. Are you afraid of dying? I am not, but when it happens I’d be in my bed. So you should be afraid every time you go to bed! You’re such a Mantuan pig-headed! On the 10th November 1917, in Milan, Tazio marries Carolina Perina with civil ceremony after their elopement. On the 14th September 1918 their first-born child, Giorgio, was born. - Why did they eloped? - That’s how it worked at that time, if a girl spent the night with you, you had to marry her. - Why? - I've just told you... ...at the time we had to do it like this. - I don't understand, grandpa... - You can’t understand yet. Sleep now, it’s late, we’ll carry on tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night sweety. Don’t worry, Ada. We’ll be back on Friday and you’ll be here on Saturday so... Of course I’ll drive slow... This is a beautiful thing for him, he wants to do it and I’m happy for him... Yes, I’ll call you every hour...okay? Yes, bye...thank you - Leo, we’re leaving! - Hooray! - Leo, come! - Here I am! We had hard times after the War, petrol was 95 liras per liter. - What is a lira? - Our old currency. That day, I woke up at 5 a.m. and came over here, my father didn't know where I was so he was mad at me as I stayed away all day long. - Was he mad as hell? - Yes, he was, I made a mischief. - What is mischief? - It's something you shouldn’t do. Everything has changed here, it was all different! Nuvolari was arriving from there, he stopped here whilst I came from that side... Mario, Nuvolari is arriving! - Let’s do something for him! - What? - Give this coffee I've made to him. - Why me? Tazio would be glad to get a coffee from a child! There he is! - That’s fine! - Sorry! Didn’t know it’s so hot! He should be besides me. What about the last Biondetti Alfa radio communication? - You’re leading! He's late - I knew it! I’ve never washed that t-shirt, you know? Sterina neither dared it. I still have it hidden in a drawer. - I’ll give it to you! - Thanks! - Welcome! - Thank you. - Let me accompany you. - Thanks. Dear little brother, she’s Elena, my new fiancée, - Isn’t she beautiful? - Enchanting! Thank you! Well, how did you choose Mr Borzacchini? I told you, he’s adore me! My congratulations for your victory and for your lovely wife. Thank you! He always copies me in everything! You have blue eyes too! Yeah but those are MY blue eyes, Tazio! Varzi’s here... Nice of you to invite him. Actually I did not expect he’d come. As we go for the line, we see two lights in front of us. We were up, but Tazio wanted to surpass them. We were really close but Varzi wouldn’t give up. "Turn off the headlights... Varzi would think we got a car damage and chill". It worked! He didn’t see us arriving, neither heard. So we overtook him! You should have seen Varzi’s face in that moment! Weren’t you afraid, Guidotti? You know Nuvolari is crazy! He plays with death every time he jumps in his car! We were speeding at 200km/h! I could not see anything! Yes, in that moment... ...I saw my life before my eyes. Did your team order to stay in second position? Yes, it did. But Tazio didn’t care. He just wanted to surpass Varzi at all costs. We were there, he overtook me in few seconds and won! Just incredible! Here he is! The great Achille Varzi! - Nice to see you. - My pleasure. Guess she’s Norma? Enchanté! She's Elena, my new fiancée. Hello Tazio. He beat me yesterday. The great Tazio Nuvolari! Achille has been up all night long! He’s so fast but I’m faster in the dark. Can we talk for a moment? Carolina, please, offer something to this lovely girl, while I’m talking with Achille. Please. There are many people to celebrate your victory. Have you read the newspapers? I’ve read them all. We cannot fail to celebrate... the value of Nuvolari and his faithful mechanic Guidotti... Tazio Nuvolari is the man of sheer speed... He's the brave man, who beat Varzi turning off the car headlights... You have read closely... Bullshit, you’re unfair and you win unfairly! Team orders were clear. I should stay ahead. Nobody remembers the second place. Victories are important. The fucking orders were clear. Do not overtake me! Aren’t you afraid when your husband races? I am terrified. I love seeing Achille speeding with his racing car... ...I get excited! They had been challengers for several years, and yet they respect each other very much. Actually Achille didn’t want to come over here. I had to drag him... I do understand. Tazio overtook him in such a crazy way... Would you walk me to the toilet? - Of course. - Thanks. Achille, we’ve known each other for years. You were with me when I founded my team and gave you the Bugatti 2000. This race won't break our friendship. Do you agree? You win some, you lose some. There will be other challenges for us. You played dirty, you know that. Without that headlights bullshit you’d never won. In Tripoli I overtook you without turning off the headlights! I'm talking about yesterday! Several times you won and I lost, especially on motorbike... Please, just forget it! You’re such a piece of shit, Tazio. To win, you would spit in your wife’s face or let her sleep with your worst enemy. Do not exaggerate, Achille. How I would spit in your face! The one who wins a race is not the fastest... ...but the bravest. I’ll be watching you on the Alexandria’s track. If you don’t take off whilst I surpass you. I will smash your car. Understand? Enjoy yourself. - Are you ok, Norma? - Yes I am! How do I look? I want to be perfect for Achille. You’re gorgeous. I wish I’d be like you... and I want you to be my friend. - Aren’t you jealous of Achille? - No. They're racers! It’s fair they meet some slutty bitches after racing, the important thing is they come back home! Oh no, Tazio would never cheat on me. It's true. There’s no reason to laugh. There you are! I was looking for you! - Why? - I want to leave now. Hurry up. Bye, my friend! Come on, Compagnoni, tell us how this scoundrel managed to beat me! I couldn’t let you win the Circuit of Three Provinces! - Indeed, I won’t race anymore. - Mr Ferrari, don’t say it. When we left Porretta, immediately after the starting, this man crossed a bump in the road so fast, that I was hurled in the back of the car because of the recoil. Damn! You’d have killed him, you know? - Borzacchini, do not exaggerate - Luckily I was holding the handle - It was all calculated anyway - Your insanity is unbeatable! Let me finish. Tazio saw me, but he didn’t slow down He kept driving with one hand with the other he helped me to get back in the cockpit. He saved me, but... the strong hit broke the gas pedal. So we stopped, open the bottom to find out there was a broken spring. - So what do you think I did? - No clue. What? - Tell me what did I do. - I don't know! I pulled out my belt tying it together with the petrol grip, closed the bottom and we drove the car together. Tazio ruled the clutch, gearshift and brake while I was pulling the belt and speeding up. Sheer madness! I didn’t know how to hold myself! I was pulling the belt with my right hand as I was trying to hold me somehow with my left hand! Also because there was no handle anymore! Then the stones started hurting my hand, that started bleeding. I don’t know how I got through it. When you overtook me, you ran like lightning. However we can say it was a great satisfaction for us to overtake you! Wasn’t it? Well, I do accept my defeat and as I announce to all of you my retirement, let’s have a toast for my team Nuvolari and Borzacchini... to our next victories! One, two, three! Long live the great Alfa Romeo team! - IN SICILY THE 23 - RD TARGA FLORIO WAS WON BY TAZIO NUVOLARI WHO HAD DRIVEN AN ALFA ROMEO SPEEDING AT 79,294 KM/H The slowest animal to the fastest man... As D’Annunzio told me when he gave it to me. That will be my new lucky charm, Carolina. I will print it out on my yellow shirt and on my car. All the newspapers are talking about your Targa Florio! I promised it to Mr D’Annunzio... Do you remember the first time you went on a bike with me? How could I forget it? I have fulfilled all of my dreams. I’m the fastest pilot in the world married with the best woman in the world! You’re back dad! I am, my little love. - Have you won, dad? - Yes I have, Giorgio. How are you? Good morning Mr. Nuvolari and welcome back. Good morning, Maria. - Giorgio has to do his homework. - Don’t you? - Yes, dad. - Do your homework. We’ll talk later - Will you tell me about the racing? - Of course I will! Welcome back, dad... did you win? - Obviously! - There are some children at the gate, will you not let them get in today? I promised them that I’d let them take some apples at my return. Children never forget promises. Wait for me downstairs... I’m coming... Come with me. What’s happening? Speak to me please. I spoke with Paride Mambelli, after the race. That coward who was in my car? Perhaps he’s a wise man, not a coward. What did he tell you? He told me you drove like a madman and he was really afraid of dying. You always shouted at him to protect himself under the bottom, in case the car turned over... - He really told you that? - Yes, he did. Well, he won’t race with me anymore. I do ask you to quit. You’re asking me to die right now... I still think of the death of Brilli-Peri. When you married me you knew where I’m up to... Their death made me return to Alfa Romeo with Varzi and Campari even if I argued with Varzi, we don't talk anymore after that Thousand Miles. You have fulfilled your dreams! You cannot understand. Do not treat me like an idiot. Several times I have closed my eyes, thinking of you with some sluts at the racing box or at the parties afterwards. But I cannot bear to watch you die. It is not enough reach your limit, you must overcome it. See that? It is round like the world, like a ball, like the wheels of a bike or a car. - Or a bicycle. - Or like doughnuts. - Or the circuit where you race. - Exactly. We live in a perfect circle. - I’m rooting for you not for Varzi! - Good! My grandpa told me once you got tied up to a motorcycle to keep racing because you fractured your hands and your legs. It was a long time ago, when I used to do bikes racing. Your grandpa exaggerated a bit, I just had some bruises and scratches. Why did you tie yourself up? Because in this way, I couldn’t stop, I could just drive faster and faster! Between 1934 and 1939, the Flying Mantuan has won so many races, in French, German and American homes. He's the most beloved driver all around the world. Can you believe it? Varzi’s supporters loved him too. Wow, he must have been a great driver. Indeed, he was the best! He was the inventor of the controlled skid! When he was 43, driving his Alfa Romes B-P3, he bit Adolf Hitler! The German Grand Prix, the biggest prize for the German automakers, has been won by the Alfa Romeo car, masterfully driven by Tazio Nuvolari. Then it was the origin of the end for Achille Varzi He was testing his Auto Union on the Monza track, a jewel of the German car manufacturers, who recently hired him... - Mr Varzi! - Mr Ricordi! Congratulations. So you will debut at the Grand Prix of Tunisi, next May the 5th! You know how much that race means to me! Oh, I know. This time I'm going to beat Nuvolari, that guy can’t drive, he might be fast but has no style at all! By the way, have you seen that woman? She’s gorgeous! I’d advise you to give up on her. The blonde lady is German. Furthermore, she is married to a German driver. You won't compromise your career in the Auto Union, for a woman! There's no risk, German hired an Italian as a new driver because we are the foreigners they like the most! You know very well why. If it wasn’t for politics, you'd still be in the Alfa Romeo. Politics? That’s ridiculous, I am done with Ferrari and his team. The car created by Porsche for the Auto Union has no rivals! I reckon Nuvolari is still kicking himself. You have to thank Stuck for that. If it wasn’t for him, there would be Tazio driving the Auto right now. One month later, Nuvolari met Varzi, on the shores of Lake Garda You know how it would be! What happened between you and the blonde woman? We’re together... You are out of your mind! You are the devil, I am the artist. But you can’t steal your teammate’s woman! Let it go. Real problems are others... What? Tazio... I admire you and love you. I’ve got over that Thousand Miles. We have won and lost so many races together. We have fought... but you... you have something I haven’ you’re not afraid to die. We’re all going to eventually. I’d rather do it on my car, than laying on a hospital bed or seeing my old body falling apart. What’s your secret? I’ve my father’s courage, a natural sense of danger... I just face it, and win it... People usually stop at risks, they do not dare to go further... I’m madly in love with her. You drove like crazy in Tunisi! You went even off the road. You're lucky to be alive! I was high on morphine. There, I’ve said it. What the hell? Who gave you that shit? Ilse. That woman bewitched me. I always come and walk here before a Grand Prix... What should I do, Tazio? You have to go to rehab and leave that woman. I can’t. I owed you one. This means you care about me. Don’t you? I do... I’m calling a doctor I know and you’ll go to rehab. You and me, we still have to be the Italians’ dream! One more thing... journalists may want us to race, just you and me on a circuit. If I lost, I’d never forgive myself, neither do you I guess. So, I’d say no. if you agree... I do agree...my friend Can I ask you something? Go on. Why do you race? The sound of the engine, the wind on your face the desire to reach the car in front of you, the scream of the crowd once you have surpassed it. There, that is my drug! Listen, alright, call your doctor... and thanks, Tazio. My friend... 4TH NOVEMBER 1936 NUVOLARI WON THE VANDERBILT CUP God has not been fair to me. I’d rather have died myself, on the Vanderbilt circuit. Instead, He took our son, Giorgio. I shouldn’t have gone. I shoudn't leave him. I should have stayed here, next to him. He told you to go and win for him. Now he is up there. Call Alberto. Dad! You’re back! His son’s death left a heavy mark on him. He haven’t left his home for months. He didn’t want to race anymore, even though everyone wanted him to. But the time he really thought of retiring was at the Pau circuit, where there was an accident, and his car went up in flames. With my half-closed eyes... I could see the trees standing out in the sky Doctors around me, worried for my critical conditions. A mechanic hopelessly yelling I was dead. “I am alive! and these people think I’m dead”. I cannot believe it. Do you know what I was thinking while I was about to die? that... I could never see you again. you fool Nuvolari! I do apologise, Mr. Gobbato wants to visit you. Ah...the big manager... let him in. - Mr Nuvolari awaits you. - Thanks. Good morning, Mrs. Carolina Good morning Mr. Gobbato. I’ll leave you alone. No, stay with us, I want you to hear what I am about to say. You barely made it, you hell of a Tazio! Thanks to those guys who came with the blankets. Otherwise your car would have killed me! I can’t trust Alfa Romeo anymore, you gave me a shitty car! The tank wasn’t well-built, and I was about to lose my life. And it was not my fault - but a fault in its build. - It was just... ... an isolated case, Tazio. We have won so many races. The couple Alfa Romeo-Nuvolari is strong now, and crowd loves it. I have taken my decision. I’m retiring. Come on! I don’t believe you. Besides, you can’t do it! Do you know what does it means, economically speaking? You must respect the agreement. I don’t give a shit about the agreement! I’m done with racing. You can’t even give me a top car ...besides, I'm starting to feel old. Perhaps you’re starting to be afraid. Get out of here! - I’m sorry, I was just kidding. - Get out, now! As you wish... I hope you’ll change your mind I doubt it. I hope you’ll recover soon... - If you would... - That’s my last decision. Goodbye, Mrs. Carolina. You treated him so harshly. That was nothing. I could have died with that bad-built car. I must confess you, I am happy. This moment had to come... ...give me the camera please. Mr. Nuvolari, is it true that you are retiring? Yes, it had to happen, eventually. You've decided after the accident, so are you suddenly afraid to die? No, my only fear is that Alfa Romeo could no longer compete with the German Mercedes and Union. - So I don't want to race anymore. - What are you going to do, now? I'm going to the States with my family, to visit New York! - When are we going to get there? - In a couple of hours. Who won the war? The English and American allies came to our rescue. During the war, everything stopped. It was tough, dear Leo, with all those bombs falling every day. - Was Nuvolari in the War too? - No. He endured it, as everybody else. After the armistice, in 1946, something bad happened to him again. His younger son, Alberto, died too. He was the same age as Giorgio, 18 years old. Such fatality. Thank you for coming, Donna Laura Modena is not that far, and I wanted to take a walk. Enzo gave me a personal driver who is taking me around. You sounded a bit worried at the phone. Tazio came back from Gardone sul Garda. He spent two weeks in a convent. His lungs are in a poor condition. The air is better there than Mantua. Laura... The real evil has been our son’s death. Too much pain for me, for him. I am sorry... Enzo and me, we are sympathetic. How is Mr. Ferrari? Well, He’s training for the Thousand Miles. - I wanted to talk about this... - Tell me. May you ask your husband if he has a car for Tazio? - Carolina... - I know him well, he needs to race. He may decide to kill himself at the Thousand Miles this is what every Italian thinks as well. Besides, it’s a very stressful race for someone of his age. 56 years are more than a few. Instead, I think he’ll die if he doesn’t get back to race. - You'd waited for years his retire. - That is true... but, racing at the 1000miles would be a rebirth for him, I do know that. Nuvolari must come back. I want it. My two sons in Heaven want it... Italy wants it. Are you sure of what you’re asking me? Laura, we’ve been friends for a long time... Tazio won his best races with your husbands. Coming back to the Ferrari is the right thing to do. It will be his last race... Alright... That’s how we’ve got to our race, the mythical Thousand Miles of 1948. The one that made him a legend. Where he lost the hood we're bringing to Mantua. Everything’s clear, isn’t it? Here we have Learco Guerra! The cyclist known as the human train. - Come on, Tazio, stop it. - World champion in 1931, wonderful passer, but good with flies too! Standing in front of the best driver in the world! Two old folks close to pension. What about your passion for photography? When I take pictures I can feel the same speed of when I held the wheel and I perceive the power of this little machine in my hands. I think I had to become a photographer to truly understand all the beauty and happiness of being a driver. Mrs. Nuvolari? Yes? I’ve tried to talk to your husband but he’s never replied. I would like you to have this, if you’d be so kind to read it, please. What is it? Please, read it as you get home. I thought you should know... not for me, but for my daughter... Your daughter? Read it, and you’ll understand. You’ve cheated on me, Tazio. You... disgust me. She’s crazy! I’ve never met her! You have a daughter. - It’s impossible! I don't know her! - What is this? You bastard... Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Look what the cat dragged in... You are indestructible with your cars, as I’ve seen. How long has it been? 30 years, at least. How comes you’re coming back to ruin my family making up stories? I’ve written the truth... Ugolina! Look, Ugolina, did you want to meet your father? Here he is, the famous Tazio Nuvolari! That night I got pregnant... I cannot believe you. I don’t want anything from you, you can even leave but you just had to know. Swear to God you are telling the truth! May I drown in the deepest hell if Ugolina isn't your daughter! I didn’t know anything about it! That was me... I just wanted to know... So I really pushed my mother! Leave us alone for a moment, please. Get inside the car with me, we need to talk. No, if you want, we can take a walk... Kind of a twist of fate, your wife and me having the same name. Listen, Carolina, what could I do now? Nothing. I don’t want anything from you. I only did it for Ugolina, she wanted to see you in person and I thought it was the right thing for her. She is married and mom of a 16 years old child. He’s in the fields, working with his dad now. I have another man, working on the river Po. He's like a father to her, and loves her like his own daughter. Do you want money? So it is true... ...that champions suck in real life! Do you realize you’ve just destroyed my marriage? What you did today is enough for me. Coming here. I’ll write to her that I was lying and I’ve made up everything. Carolina... I’d loved you for years after you disappeared. I’ve been your silent lover for months and raised your daughter, what do you want from me yet? Would you ever forgive me? I didn’t know anything. I’ll give an annuity to Ugolina. As you may know, my sons died. Leave, please... Go away! I have wife and a child.. at home. You are afraid of racing with Nuvolari! Mr. Ferrari, you know what people say about him After his second son’s death he wants to die racing. Do not believe this rubbish... Listen, I’ll give you a bonus at the starting, and another one when it’s over. Besides, you’ll have an insurance that if anything really goes wrong with Nuvolari, your wife and child will get 30 thousands liras... instead, if nothing goes wrong, you will be fine for two years at least, thanks to all the money I’ll pay you. Come on, Scapinelli! This is the chance of a lifetime! How often do you get to race beside a living legend! That was To let Nuvolari back on race again at the age of 56. Pull over somewhere, let’s see what we can do! No! It’ll fall out in any case. Behind the wheel of the Ferrari 1049 Tazio Nuvolari is leading... The fearless flying Mantuan is back greater than ever... 20 minutes behind him there's Biondetti who's driving a Ferrari car, too. Nuvolari, beside his old friend Scarpinelli, he’s becoming a legend with an incredible hourly average...126! The whole Italy is moved. Attention! Nuvolari is leading the Thousand Miles! When they arrive to Rigali of Gualdo Tadino, at the 184th km, there were rumors about Nuvolari being on the first place... the Ferrari is like a catapult. With its engine at full regime, the fender falls out. The wind hits it and before moving vertically on the left side of the car, the engine cover crushes the windscreen. Push it!! let it fall out!! Not now! If it stops we’ll push it away. In that moment the whole Italy is moved, everyone is crying because they know that, probably, it will be his last race. Let me check, I hear a noise in the transmission. No, We’ll check it out in Reggio Emilia... Come over here Leo, come here! You might be wondering why we pulled over here... An important thing of our history happened here! Right here, in this place! There you go! Nobody heard from him for hours after he was pointed out at the head of the racing but here is where... ...Nuvolari finished his race. It’s over! The leaf spring collapsed. It’s a pity... you were the first, and Biondetti was very far... Where is he? Inside the rectory, with the priest. Tazio, come on, next year you’ll make it! Ferrari... we don’t get to have days like this at our age. Remember this, and taste them till the last bite, if you can. Father! What has Padre Pio told you? Nothing... to have faith... We have faith...we do have faith... Nuvolari had survived in each race he participated. He died at home arounded by all the trophies he won in his llife. Nuvolari was stroke by a serious pulmonary illness both his children, who died too young, can now see him again wearing his legendary uniform. His wife will never see him anymore. His friends Villoresi, Ascari, Fangio, Masetti and Guerra are pushing the last car on which Tazio lies. He was the last one of a generation of champions among Maserati, Campari, Varzi, Materazzi who died before him, but Tazio has been able to extend his race and now can enjoy his victory driving his own car to peacefully reach Heaven. - Good morning! - Good morning! - I need to talk to the director. - What about? We have the hood Nuvolari lost during the 1948 Thousand Miles. I was the boy who found it... - What are you saying? - We have it in the car outside. I wish I’d met him.
