ACCORDING TO LEGEND, HERE STOOD GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE Eighth homework essay Wilhelm Heise, 14 years old Berlin, March 9, 1912 War is a frightful, raging horror. It strikes herd and shepherd alike. With the tremendous cultural advances over recent centuries, the conviction has increasingly gained traction across Christendom that war is but human slaughter. Completely contrary to the Commandments of Christian love for our neighbours and enemies. How much misery and destitution has been wrought by a recklessly started war? Out of wounded conceit those hot-tempered brutes on the throne begin a war like some Louis XIV or the bloodthirsty Corsican, and the people have to pay for it. Burning homesteads, smouldering rubble heaps, bloody, contorted corpses, screaming and groaning wounded, families distraught over a dead father, over their beloved sons. Here lies the bloom of humanity, trampled upon by the raging victor's pounding footsteps. Never shall a nation forget the defeats and wounds inflicted upon it by the enemy. Thereafter that hatred will yet again brutally vent its spleen in a fresh, bloody war. But afterwards all cry out: Woe to the vanquished! And hideous is the havoc wrought by war in the spiritual realm. Everywhere the people's level of education suffers, whilst superstition thrives in the soil of stupidity. Those bloodthirsty brutes on the throne seek to guarantee the steely mechanics and obedience of their armies through ignorance and delusion. Hence, they carefully shield their people from the beacon of enlightenment and of knowledge, so that no liberating ray of light penetrates their subjects' dark night. Their science is instilled on their cannon barrels. Hence, it is little wonder that a Nation is so deeply engulfed in ignorance and superstition. With spiritual degeneration comes the decline in ethics and morals. In war, blood and thunder are virtues. Man's bestial nature celebrates its greatest triumphs. He derives pleasure in his enemy's death. Ghastly brutality and even the vilest wickedness are permissible. If one kills in peace time, that is deemed as murder, and is punished. If one commits the same act in war, but on a much vaster scale, it will be greeted with approval, and even rewarded. In war, man turns into an animal. Once he sees blood flow, he's doomed. And he'll strive thereafter to bathe in the blood of his enemies. Sometimes, however, it is impossible to avoid war. Should an overpowering enemy offend the German people, then it spreads through every corner of the Fatherland like spring awakening. Woe betide those who dare to stretch out their hands with disdainful greed to rob the German Empire of a patch of its dear, noble native soil. Then, yes, German people awaken! Then, even he who otherwise opposes war will become a full-blooded, true patriot. Early September 1922, Berlin Wilhelm Heise to Edith Hirschhorn Dearest Fraulein! During my summer trip I had the pleasure to get to know your Viennese sisters Irma and Sidi, as well as your brother Otto. We spent a few days together in Zell am Ziller and also made a trip lasting several days together. I was then assigned the task of passing on to you in person regards from your siblings, though they were unsure of your address in Berlin. Yesterday, Fraulein Sidi wrote me a letter in which she informed me of your Berlin abode. Should you care to spend a few hours chatting about Tyrol and our shared experiences there, I would be honoured to fulfil the task entrusted to me. Given my ignorance of your diary, I can't suggest a time. But if given sufficient notice, I could make myself available to meet you one evening near Potsdamer Platz at the Café Josty. Please send me a message should you have the time and the desire to meet. I remain respectfully yours, Dr Wilhelm Heise Berlin 39, Samoastrasse 11 June 1945 Edith Heise, née Hirschhorn Draft for a personal resumé Alser Strasse. Change for U6. I was born in Vienna in 1899. My father was a commercial clerk. Mother had worked as a seamstress in a factory. Then spent a few years at home. Both were Jews and came to Vienna at a very young age. I grew up as the middle child in a family of five. Things were in short supply in our household, but I hardly noticed that, for I grew up in comfortable surroundings and everyone was kind to me. I must have been twelve years old when I began noticing many differences between people, started asking about the whys and the wherefores. In our home, the evenings always saw very lively discussions, for we had a wide circle of relatives and friends. In particular, a younger brother of my father, a class-conscious worker, a bookbinder at a left-wing publishers, made a deep impression on me. Thanks to him, I was introduced to the ideas of Socialism. This uncle, the others as well, my father, and his elder sisters, all died later during the Hitler years, on being deported to Poland. At that early age, however, I went to the only humanistic grammar school for girls with public status. Learning, especially classical languages, came easily to me. Palffygasse. Please be attentive, others might have greater need of your seat. In 1914/15, considered highly gifted, I was sent to the Vienna School of Applied Arts, where I studied with enthusiasm and perseverance: Drawing, painting, sculpture, and naturally a lot of theory. That was the time of the First World War. Wartime events might then have galvanised me toward becoming politically engaged. But my professional work so thoroughly absorbed me that I didn't think about anything else. I always kept aloof. Perhaps because I was so different from my fellow students, many from the Sudetenland with Völkisch and ethno-nationalistic backgrounds and otherwise lacklustre conservatives. There were heated and impassioned debates about Judaism. Though we argued, we worked together in a comradely fashion. Elterleinplatz. Change to 9, direction Gersthof. Then came the 1918 Revolution, which I supported. Even so I remained aloof, everything felt distant. My work alone was permanent, and dear to me. Of course I hated the war. I saw the most gruesome war cripples begging in the Vienna streets, saw some enjoying the good life in those post-war times while the rest of us starved. Now it strikes me as though I was seeing things through a fog back then. I came to Berlin in 1922. First as artistic director in a company, thereafter I spent two semesters under Professor Giess at the Public School of Applied Arts on Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse. Rosensteingasse. Change to 9. In 1924, I married a communist, Dr Wilhelm Heise, he was a school inspector, a teacher at that time... The draft of the résumé breaks off here. Berlin, December 1922 William to Edith, back in Vienna Dear Edith! I'm really sorry that I let you go back to Vienna. Yesterday I gave my lesson in Tegel. I talked about"Die and Become!" for an entire hour. I feel this was my happiest hour and I truly, truly regretted that you weren't present. Whether I'm thinking of you? Mother says I'm so very foul-humoured ever since the Viennese lady has gone away. Darling, I'm actually not in a happy state at present. I've been reading so much Strindberg and that weighs damned heavily, if one is so inclined. Strindberg, I mean the analyst of human beings bar none. He is evil. And perhaps, in some way, I am too? Otherwise, how can I re-live this so agonizingly? Well darling, let's leave it at that. When we next see each other, everything will be just nice, yes? I kiss you and love you, Wilhelm Dear Lad! When you get this letter the day after tomorrow, it will be a full year since we met. It was on September 8, on a Friday. Do you still remember? I'm a bit sad today. And now I don't know what else to write to you other than there's a beautiful story of you and me in the beautiful wide world. Come! I keep thinking of you over and over, and I'm so happy and proud that you're fond of me and that I'm allowed to be good to you. How I'd like to be at your side every night! Only sometimes it felt you've virtually forgotten me in all this betrothal affair. My folks are hale and hearty. If they're now afraid to let me go to Berlin? They have, I think, more awful ideas about it than is necessary. But over time I've got to bring them round to believing that I absolutely must go to you now. Do your parents know that I have no money? That I am a Jew? Dear sweet, big one! I don't feel right about being financially dependent on you. But I'm saving so that I can come to you soon. Here's a recipe: 150 grams of grated almonds or nuts 150 grams of sugar One lemon, juice and rind, grated Two whole eggs Three extra yolks Three egg-whites whipped One tablespoon flour First, whisk eggs and sugar for about half-an-hour, and then gradually mix everything in, with the whipped egg-whites right at the end. Young lad, jot that down on a slip of paper and give it to your mother. And don't gripe about me! A very tender, hushed kiss. Edith Dearest Dittle! It's really not easy for me now, I feel so lonesome and dissatisfied inside. Just come, then things will be different for sure. Over recent days I've been vividly imagining this: I'm sitting on the balcony and reading. Sometimes I look up. You're sitting in the opposite corner busy with something. Sometimes you look up. Sometimes we both look up at the same time, look at each other and smile. I'm writing from school while the boys are writing their class essay. Yesterday, the course began in Gleimstrasse. Tomorrow the Tegel one begins again. The Spandau course goes through till December. In Spandau, I pocket 80 billion marks per hour. That sounds like something, but it's nothing. Today, bread costs ten billion, the tram 800 million, a paperback 4 billion 800 million, the morning paper 500 million, a gold Reichsmark 15 billion, a gold Pfennig 150 million marks. And tomorrow it'll be yet another tale. Got to run! The bell's about to go and some of the scoundrels are already handing in their finished essays. A jolly load of old tripe! "My Earliest Boyhood Memories." Vienna, October 1923 Dear Doctor! Your kind letter has made my dear wife and I very happy. You will appreciate that our most ardent wish has been that our beloved Dittl meets a man capable of completely understanding her nature. We have already become very fond of you thanks to our dearest Dittl's descriptions, and your qualities offer us a guarantee of a happy and content future for our child. We sincerely hope that we may be able to welcome you as our dear son-in-law. Naturally, we will venture beyond formalities and discuss everything with you in person regarding Edith's departure. You will then be our dear guest, and we trust that the time you've set aside for your holiday is not too short. Until we meet, may you fare well, with cordial salutations, from your devoted Max Hirschhorn Dear Doctor! I, too, heartily welcome you as my dear son-in-law and assure you that I am very much looking forward to your arrival. Best regards, Anna Hirschhorn I hereby acknowledge receipt of the Lord Mayor's order (3-22-1673) of the 7th of June with notification that the Reich Minister intends to apply paragraph 6 of the Civil Service Restoration Act against my person. Concerning the request that I present my view on the matter, let me state: I presume... I have to assume the fact of my mixed-race marriage... I have to assume the fact of my mixed-race marriage has induced the Minister to take this measure ...to take this step of early retirement... ...to decide that I must take early retirement. By no means do I deny the tensions, which my mixed marriage engenders... I take them very seriously. I am fully aware of the tensions that my mixed marriage engender. Only they are a deeply personal, most real problem. The last thing I wish to do is to minimize them. Yet they are certainly my most personal... Yet I can assure you that it is most definitely my problem. In the hope... Secondly, aside from this negative assessment... ...I refer, inter alia, to the literary critical works on Hauptmann and Strindberg from the years 23 to 29, as proof of my attitude and testimony to my actions...

I would request that the Minister might grant me an audience for a more in-depth and lengthy presentation. I do hope... In the hope that the Minister... I beseech the Minister to allow me to remain in the sphere of activity, for which I believe I was born. I can ensure that I will give my best... Vienna, October 1939 Max Hirschhorn to Wilhelm Heise in Berlin My dear Wilhelm! Though I so rejoiced at a letter from you after such a long time, I didn't derive much pleasure from its content. My dears, look into the future with a cheerful heart, all will be well again with God's help. Let us stay in good health and good humour. Enclosed, I'm sending you the family tree, of which you'll probably take a dim view. They were highly respectable, dignified people. Of course, with the exception of my humble self. Your father, Max Vienna, November 1939 Dearest Edith, You're surely dying to know whether we've already settled into the new apartment. Well, my dear child, the nicest thing is that we're all under one roof, the evenings are much more pleasant because we can talk over everything together. Rudi is carefree, Truderl sings, plays tricks, and at nine bed-making begins. Organizing the various sleeping arrangements reminds me of when you were all at home, except back then I had three rooms at my disposal. You'll be miffed that we've left you in the dark for so long. With all the best will in the world we don't have the patience to write at length. It's gradually getting uncomfortable in our already uncomfortable Vienna, but let's keep our chins up and retain our good spirits as best we can. Imagine, Pepperl has also been given just a few days to clear out of her apartment. How are you, my dear child? Your father and grandpa, Max Vienna, March 2, 1941 Dear Dittl, We're sending you some odds and ends and that oil painting of you. I've got to confess, dear child, that I find it so difficult to part with the picture. It now belongs to your husband and to your children. Your aunt Pepi March 12, 1941 My dear Four! What should I tell you today? I'm slowly parting from my home, yesterday it was the dining service and today it'll be the writing desk. Tomorrow I'll shift things around a bit to make it cosy again. Greeting and kisses to you all. Yours, Elsa June 5 Edith in Vienna to Wilhelm Dear, dear Laddie, I'm told that Mummy kept calling out"Edith" at the hospital early yesterday morning. By the time I got to her side, she could no longer speak. She was still conscious though, I even told her all about you and the children; I offered her the still fresh Lilies-of-the-Valley. She strove to open wide her eyes that had so changed and raising her arms she moved as though she wanted to embrace me. Oh, Laddie, she was so feeble. Her high forehead so splendid with her shining grey curls. Her eyes deep in the sockets and ever so slightly open. The nose transformed, so fine, so pallid, and her poor mouth so small and old, half open, and her breathing laboured. Laddie, I sat by her bed until almost midday, took hold of her hand. Toward dusk, I called out "Mummy" and she turned her dear head toward me, but she could no longer talk. When Elsa and I had to leave, she was still breathing calmly and deeply, we drew some hope, for it struck me as though she were asleep. And the nurse said half an hour later she was at rest, quietly crossing over to yonder shore. My dearest mother! Papi, may you and our dear lads remain healthy, and I'll try to be good always. Edith Vienna, August 15, 1941 Max Hirschorn to Edith in Berlin My dear Dittl! I'm keeping quite well, thank God. I'll probably have to give up smoking, for it has been strictly forbidden to sell tobacco to Jews for a few days now. For the time being, I've a few days' supply, then I'll suck on an empty pipe. Yesterday, I went to the cemetery and passed on greetings at the graveside to our dear mum from all her children. The grave mound is already finished and I've arranged for grass on top of it. We'll plant some flowers. We also ordered a makeshift memorial tablet, for we can't get headstones now. Warmly kissing all four of you. As always, your faithful father September 18 Dittl, dear sister, are you, too, having such difficulties buying meat? Now I'm taking everything at once, it's hardly enough for a meal anyway. And have to line up for four to five hours. And there's just mutton for us, or today, for example, merely sausage. Father is terribly out of sorts and unfortunately I can't help him at all. Ghastly. We've also got several outlets for coal but we have to fetch the coal ourselves. But we now have only one room to heat. Perhaps we'll also get a mild winter. What stupid, vain worries we have? And so, the years fly by. My dearest ones, it's high time I was in bed. So, I'm hitting the sack. Besides, the light disturbs father. Stay healthy, dear ones, all four of you, and tenderly embraced by your Elsa. October 6 I heartily congratulate you on the birthday of our dearest Wolfi. May he continue to thrive and grow up into a splendid, hard working man, and may you long derive much pleasure from him. Lest we get carried away, a shipment to Poland is imminent. Reports say the first affected will be deportees and former convicts, later those living in the outer districts. Reports also say there will be shipments from the old Reich as well. We can't yet know the truth of the matter, but these rumours are very definitely doing the rounds. For the time being we shan't despair or upset ourselves, shall wait and see what happens. What did you hear about it in Berlin? Your truly loving father and grandpa I, too, extend my warmest congratulations to the big boy. May he give you cause for much pleasure. My God, how time flies, the lad will be 16! Yes, we're getting old! And it's also seen to that we're becoming so quicker than necessary. Once again something to tremble and fret about. And now we know all about what awaits us there and from reliable sources. I can't even bear to think that we might be affected by it. And what's more, winter is just around the corner. Children, what kind of a world is this! For the time being I'm burying myself in work. Much love to you all from your Elsa. October 7 Today I've got to add a brief postscript to the letter we sent yesterday. Unfortunately, the Polish affair is taking more concrete shape. Yesterday, throughout the day we heard from several people who have already received the dreaded invitation to the collection point for the initial transport. Even a doctor across from us in the alleyway. Word has it that 5,000 will go from Vienna. And another 20,000 from the Reich. We're only allowed take 50 kg of luggage per person. I've no idea of the permissible amount of money. We don't know how the names are drawn up, who will be affected by it. Therefore, dear Wilhelm, if you think you could do anything to help us in any way, then please take the necessary steps. Sometimes the interval between notification and departure is no more than four to five days. Don't get cross, children, that we torment you all with our worries. I kiss you heartily. Yours, Elsa October 8 My Dearests! I've to write you yet again today, and unfortunately these horrid times invariably force me to communicate something unpleasant. Today poor uncle Philipp received notification to present himself at the notorious collection point for the transport to Poland on the 15th. You can well imagine what kind of day we've put behind us. I can't even write properly. Fear and dread everywhere. Father is so het up that he's unable to add a few words and conveys his greetings via me. You can't imagine the state Peperl is in. Oh, children, what a life! Thousand kisses, Elsa October 12 My Dearests! Once the postman has been round and no sign of the dreaded card, we've even got to pay 5 Pfennig for it, a load is always taken off our minds. A pile of summons have already been dispatched, including to many of our acquaintances. The entire alphabet has been covered. But perhaps this time it will pass us by. Philipp is readying himself and is very distraught. Peperl is staying here for the time being. She hasn't received an injunction, but is torn about whether she should go with Philipp voluntarily. We've talked her out of it, for she's so terribly nervous and instead of helping him might even be a burden. But I think her conscience is tormenting her. Why do we have to live through these times? Yours, Elsa October 17 My Dearests! Since early Wednesday dear Philipp is at the collection point in Sperlschule, and this transport, the second already, is supposed to leave on Sunday. Probably to Lodz, where a huge shanty ghetto has been built. Let's hope our turn doesn't come before spring, I'd prefer to spend winter in Vienna. Your faithful father October 20 I rarely venture outdoors any more, the weather is inclement and then I can't get used to the left hand "decoration". It's quite alright as long as I stay in the 2nd district, but I get stared out of it once I enter the western districts or the Inner City, where there are so many strangers. Dear Philipp made off on Sunday evening and we couldn't even accompany him to the train. Your truly loving father, Max October 30 My Dearest Ones! Just as I want to put pen to paper, along comes your letter, Ditterl. Due to the bad weather, we aren't so often in the graveyard these days. We're now only allowed to board the trailer-car, that means, the rear platform, and we can only sit when all the others, that is the Aryans, have seats. We can't use buses at all. Life is becoming all the more beautiful. Our coal ration card has been taken away, there's no new one for us yet. Well, the gas oven in the kitchen also warms quite nicely. Today we had very good fried potatoes. Oh, children, everything would be all well and we would be satisfied with our lot, if only they left us alone! Yours, Elsa Do you often have night-time visits? November 13 If only we had suitcases. We're still short two large suitcases. But courage, dearest sister, now is the time to be a fatalist. Perhaps there's no joy in staying here, who can know... Greetings and kisses to you, Elsa December 15 Dear Dittl! Who knows what the coming hours will bring! I truly hope that father, considering his age, will be able to remain here and me to take care of him. But that is far from certain. That entirely depends on the squad leader who is coming "to do away with" things. Lovely times! Now they come, two SS men and two Jewish marshals, and give just two to three hours to pack everything and Adieu. Furniture and anything people can't take with them must remain in the flat. We can neither sell nor give anything away. Oh Dittl, life is tough. Affectionately yours, Elsa December 20 My dearest Dittl! Your last letter gave me great pleasure, you wrote it with such warmth, so truly Dittl. I fully understand you, but in these times we can't act according to our feelings. Still not a word from dear Philipp. The cold persists. We've been leaving the gas oven on all day long, otherwise it's unbearable in the flat. Perhaps we'll make it through without coal. Elsa has gone out shopping and sends you all her warmest regards. I don't want to delay in sending off these lines, so you'll just have to do without a note from the fairer sex this time. As always with profound love, your faithful father January 18, 1942 My Dearest Ones! So, our luck ran out. Without prior notification we had to be packed in three hours and are now in the collection room before evacuation. We don't yet know where we're being sent. I'll have to smuggle this postcard out. They're treating us like prisoners of war. For the moment I'm here just with Elsa. Pepperl isn't with us. Sorry, if I wrap up like this, I'm writing these lines standing between mattresses in a classroom with three windows, sleepless amidst 200 people. I couldn't have imagined anything like this. Stay healthy for my sake, and don't let them get you down. Your truly loving father Much heartfelt love to our dear parents and dear siblings. Little sister! My dears! Despite everything, we're very composed. Father is so sweet. If we can, we'll write again. Thousand kisses. God be at our side, Elsa February 1 My dear, dear Edith! It has never been so hard for me to write you a letter! It came out of the blue, for I think they were short 40 people for this transport. I'm going round, completely dumbfounded. Pepi February 5 A new decree comes into force on May 1st that we won't be allowed to use the tram at all. I still can't believe it. It is already four weeks Sunday since Max and our dear Elsa left the house. Max's flat has been vacated, there's just the furniture left, the flat has been locked since Monday. As God wills! We've finally got some coal, but it's cold and I prefer to walk around than to freeze in the room. But that's a heap of crap, if only I knew how our loved ones are getting along? My thoughts turn to Elsa, Max and Philipp over and again and I'm happy to at least be able to share memories of our loved ones with Berlin. When you have a moment someday, then I'd be delighted to read your loving words again. Farewell, my beloved, warmest greetings to you and to your loved ones. My fingers are so numb, I can't read my own writing! Many kisses, Pepi June 1 No news from our loved ones, I truly regret that I didn't go with them. Who knows where I'll end up, alone amongst strangers. You know how little I eat, I just long for variety sometimes, but war is war after all. Yesterday we received notice that we've got to move out again. I've become so accustomed to this flat since Elsa's departure. It's so bright, the windows look out onto a lovely garden. You can still write to me at the old address, Frau Kunststadt, from a mixed-race marriage who remains in the flat, will pass on all the post until I can pass on my new address. She's a very nice woman and we get along together and she deeply regrets that we've got to move. Your aunt Pepi June 16 Guess what happened: I got a room in the same house with an elderly lady with very nice people and was due to move in on Friday, but postponed the move until Monday. Lo and behold, everyone in the flat departed on Saturday. Seeing that flat is now padlocked, I got a room with another tenant in the same house, which I'm sharing with a lovely, elderly lady. Two married couples and an elderly lady also live here. I've already slept two nights here. I feel so strange and so long for you all! Thousand kisses, Aunt Peperl July 12 We've got to be patient about dear father and Elsa. Nobody gets any news, we're just hoping and staring into space. Dad is undoubtedly in an old folk's home and Elsa somewhere busy. Perhaps tomorrow there'll be news. But unfortunately this "tomorrow" is very unrealistic. I'm becoming noticeably leaner, I'm driven on by yearning, and I wonder about my calmness. I've turned to stone. July 23 Dear Edith! Thanks for everything. Best regards to you all, farewell. I'm travelling today. Pepita Don't look here, don't look there Just look straight ahead Whatever comes your way Just you never mind At times you don't even know In from out Don't take it to heart Just you never mind Lest all not go your way Take it on the chin Every thing has its reason And its meaning Don't look here, don't look there Just look straight ahead And whatever may come Just you never mind Lest all not go your way Take it on the chin Somehow every thing Has its reason and its meaning Don't look here, don't look there Just look straight ahead And whatever may come Just you never mind Everybody swing along! Wolfgang Heise, Berlin, 1948 Draft for a personal résumé I was born on October 8, 1925 in Berlin-Charlottenburg, attended the Fifth Elementary School in Steglitz, later the Körner Grammar School. My father was a tenured teacher at that time. He was dismissed in 1937. My mother is Jewish. Given my father had been excluded from the Reich's Chamber of Writers since 1933, my mother, who is a sculptor, also had no opportunity to work. Any public exhibition of her work was punishable. After the school leaving examination I became a commercial apprentice at a lamp factory. In November 44, I was arrested during a sting-operation by the Berlin Mitte Gestapo. Together with my younger brother Hans, I ended up in the Zerbst labour camp. The camp broke up in panic due to the advancing battlefront, bringing to an end to this adverse state of affairs under barely tolerable conditions. Here, the draft for a personal résumé breaks off. Fliegerhorst Labour Camp, Barrack 25 Hans December 1944 Dear Parents! Your dear letter came today: we were so eagerly awaiting it. We'll do everything right and proper, none too hastily, and well thought-out. Wolf and I will take care we don't fall into harm's way. Dear Parents, what matters is that nothing happens to you and we all get back together again in good health. So, chins up; we'll do so too and then nothing can go wrong. Fate may be that we don't see each other for some time, and should everything go awry, we might even see each other on the far side. Kindest regards to you, dear Parents. Yours, Hans February 1945 Wolf I've just read Dad's letter. I'm writing this in bed. I'm confined to barracks with a mild flu. The situation here changes by the hour. We can only piece together what's happening with difficulty. We've been kept in the dark regarding our future. The camp keeps ticking over in its usual rigid order, though everyone, foremen, soldiers, and workers know its days are numbered. Today I heard that there were official announcements about Berlin's defence on the radio. Please write about how you survived both massive air-raids. Perhaps, that moment we've been discussing is nigh. Perhaps, it'll come differently than we expect. Then, I hope at least that we each can recognize and do the most sensible thing. This future emerging from the present is all so uncertain for us all. We wait. Here, everyone has to drop his mask. Soon, even the smoothing emollience of politeness will be gone, things are getting ever tougher. At least I managed to read a little, despite the constant unrest and fever. I've come to know discernment as the capacity for disinterested pleasure, and beauty as that which generally pleases without a concept. Still, as significant and interesting as these problems may be, they sometimes seemed of little consequence. And yet, there's such bewildering clarity in the execution of the scholarly method. Outside, the snow cover has melted, heavy, grey clouds are low lying. The fields are dark brown and green, the forest deep green, and in the distance dark blue. The air is clear. An acacia bush in front of the window has spread its spiky, thorny branches. Wolf. March 8 Dear Mom, dear Dad! At long last news from you following the massive onslaught. Yesterday and this morning we heard and felt the carpet-bombing in the Magdeburg area. We've moved out of our barracks and for the time being are in the hall next to the howling turbines of the fighter jets, with 37 men to a barrack room. The day before yesterday the sun shone so warmly from a bright blue sky, revealing a different blue than in winter, a deeper, moister one. Putting my shovel aside, I leant against the side of the gravel pit I was about to empty, and relished the warmth and peace that seemed to permeate the countryside. Unfortunately, it struck me as being reality. Beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror. Horror conceals itself beneath beauty, that unity of freedom and law, that coming into being of the absolutely necessary. March 11 Today, Sunday we've a free afternoon. I'm going to sleep and read, darn my gloves and clean my boots. No roll calls, I hope. Yesterday I went to the cinema, so I don't have to go today. "The Woman of My Dreams." Thanks to the sirens, I didn't have to sit through the entire film. There's curfew right now, we can't even listen to the Wehrmacht communiqués. I'm waiting. We can't see the flow of history. April 11 Dear Mom, dear Dad! Yesterday, about 60 bombers attacked the airfield and all but destroyed the runway. It happened in a flash: I saw billowing smoke signals, ran, heard the howling, flung myself down, the first carpet bomb attack unleashed. Run, leap, run, fling myself down, over and again. After six minutes, a crater field yawned where the runway once was. The hangars remain intact. Hans, too, came through it unscathed. We've heard that tanks are rolling on Zerbst. Time to keep cool heads. Affectionately, Wolf Rosemarie Barke, diary January 4, 1945 Clausnitz, where I went skiing with three classmates over New Year's Eve. I made friends with a young chap from the village. Beautiful hands, long, curved eyelashes over calm, amber eyes. We went up and down the mountain at dusk, over fields for hours on end. We barely spoke, there were high winds. Above us, a magical light from a surreally beautiful, starry sky. And finally he kissed me, though I pressed my teeth and lips together. He tried to lose his temper, but suddenly froze, his eyes assuming a tense expression like a cornered animal. "Take a look around you," he said. We both stood very still and listened. At first I thought it was a heavenly phenomenon, a dull rumble. "Bombs," he said, calmly. And then we stood there and held onto each other tightly like children. On the north-western horizon the sky turned blood-red. Columns of smoke rose into the sky. The anti-aircraft guns' muzzle flashes like sheet lighting. Tracer ammunition on and off, then surging flames again. "Come," I said in the end, and we walked silently, our frozen hands in our trouser-pockets. Horst finally asked me if I loved him a little and I replied, "I don't know." I feel sorry for him. It went no further than harmless kisses that left me cold. February 1945 What a spine-chilling illumination as we came up from the cellar: Dresden burning. Muffled detonations of explosions, followed by huge fire columns rising into the night sky, hour after hour. For two days, the cortege of those made homeless passing our house never petered out, on foot or in hay-carts, some bandaged, others coughing, with watery, swollen, and inflamed eyes. People with nothing to their names but the scorched rags on their backs, others with small cases, boxes, and rucksacks, to a man with soot-blackened faces, many with gaping burns with greenish edges. Some with wrapped feet, others in stockings, in felt shoes, those with singed hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes, with bloody hands, limping, old and young on hay carts. Naively, I got on a bike and headed off, intending to search for relatives. I put on protective goggles in Wintergartenstrasse, for my eyes were smarting from the fine soot dust. Almost every mansion on the Karcherallee destroyed. Solid furniture, Persian rugs, oil paintings, and down-quilts lay scattered around the filthy street. A fine drizzle accentuated the desolation around me. Coming from Stübelallee toward the central railway station, I often had to dismount and carry the bike. Telegraph poles, tramlines, and debris of every sort blocked the way. The stench of burning was growing stronger. The railway viaduct on Goethestrasse had collapsed. I squeezed through the debris carrying the bike. Everything within me froze in repulsion, as I stood there in front of the first cadaver. A young girl of about eleven. Her right arm nothing more than a charred stump. Her face had remained intact, as though it had been coated in lime powder. Her eyes were shut and her mouth half-open in a childlike smile. I remounted the bike. Lindenauplatz looked like it had been strewn with corpses, curiously arranged in a circle. A dead horse lay amidst the rubble. They all looked so strangely stiff and doll-like. The fumes were becoming unbearable. Suddenly, a facade in front of me crashed to ground. Through the crackling flames, a harrowingly strained cry of "help, help" could be clearly heard, over and over again. From all around me half-strangled voices groaned and gasped: "Help, help!" I was devoid of all feeling. Impassively, my eyes panned across hundreds of corpses on that morning. Half-dazed I passed the burned-out Hygiene Museum, climbing over smouldering rubble on Albrechtstrasse, where coal was still burning in the cellars, clawing my way through debris and corpses. Two soldiers sat leaning against the fence of the Ehrlich Church. One had put his arm round the other's shoulder: They seemed asleep. They were dead. Our school was still burning. Hearing a muffled drone overhead, I looked up and saw contrails. I leapt onto the bike. Not a hundred meters away the air pressure flung me into the rubbish on the curb, where I lay motionless. Ear-splitting detonations, cascading stones, burning trees. I lay there, my body's every nerve, every fiber clinging on to life. And it erupted all over again. A young man lay three meters away from me. I crawled over beside him, we clenched our hands together. The second wave. Passed. Bike, 50 meters, down. I then lay pressed against the man next to a woman with three small children. The woman was praying unintelligibly, and I, too, prayed and utterly loathed myself. May 1945 I'm sitting in the wooden barracks of a foreigner's camp. As a Frenchwoman. Yesterday we thought the Russians would be here today. Nobody asked for papers at the entrance any more. Hitler and Mussolini dead, Berlin fallen. Thousands of soldiers surrendered. The unconditional surrender was signed last night at 2:41. And yet canons are still thundering. I can't eat with excitement and I'm smoking one cigarette after the next. I've simply got to wonder at my fatalism. I've come to the realization that I'm not intelligent. I'm shaking so much, I can't write any longer. If the camp leader came round on a control, I'd be in for it. I'll lie down on the straw mattress. The Russians are here! On horseback. Here and there, a few minor skirmishes on the streets. I've a temperature. It's too much, all too much. All at once we heard a buzzing din and a loud bang in the immediate vicinity. Pompeo rushed with me into the camp's dugout. Pompeo. Pompeo. Pompeo. Pompeo. Pompeo. After five short days, we were separated. There had been lootings and rapes, shootings as well, and a good many people had taken their lives. The most important and very practical question was: what to do with the corpses? There was no vehicle to carry them to the graveyard, a hay-cart had to be unloaded again and given to the Russians. A barrel of curd that one day appeared on the street was scrupulously handed out with great cheer. June 1947 The same sight in waiting rooms and on railway platforms across Germany, no matter which Ally's zone. People, terrified, ragged, indifferent, coarse and hungry. Oh so hungry. The crippling fear of not escaping from the mousetrap-Germany. March 1948, Udo in West Germany to East Germany Dear Rosie! I so want to moan with lust for life. It's due to the weather. Metal-blue sky, on a pitch-black night during a storm out West. It smells of the Rhine. Water. Sails. Stars. I will worship mountains and embrace trees. Every so often we've got to let go in this humdrum existence. Debts, appointments; let them wait. At night I'm fighting with you again, wriggling and twisting you. I'm looking forward to when the exams are over. What a beautiful world, and here I am, reading family law. Don't keep me waiting and write to me. I hope you're as happy as I am. I kiss your lips. Yours, Udo Rosie's diary Only now do I realize how desperately lonely I was during my escapades. Feelings of tenderness that abruptly turned to hatred. Now I'm dumbstruck at this transformation that has shaken me to the core, Udo. I'm sick from yearning for him, for his hands, his tanned forehead, his nape covered in black hair, for his tender, greyish-brown mottled eyes, for this beloved, familiar body, for this boy from head to toe, who could be my lover, friend, and comrade. April 19, 1948 Last evening I got to know Pyotry Velargowic in the tram, and with a dreadful stomach ache. He invited me for a brandy and after some hesitation I agreed. He led me through the darkness, down alleyways and round corners to a dingy drinking hole, which turned out to be full of smugglers. Within an hour he made me a marriage proposal. He is Yugoslav and engaged in some dubious activity with the Yugoslav Trade Delegation. We drank to close friendships, discussed the German situation, and ran up a bill of about 200 Marks for real coffee and a quantity of fabulous liqueurs. He's nice and has a disarming charm. I promptly talked of Udo, making the situation emphatically clear to him, albeit unsuccessfully. At the mention of "Yugoslav Trade Delegation", I thought I shouldn't miss out on the opportunity. He could be of enormous benefit to us in the event of war. It's worth seeking an innocuous basis for our relationship. April 22 I'm barely eating and am terribly nervous. On Tuesday Pyotr picked me up from college, we drank a bottle of Riesling at my place and ate well, not without serious misgivings on my part. But actually, Pyotr is right when he says, "If you not taking what I plenty, you are not Communist." April 24 I'm at my wits' end. Pyotr threatened to shoot us both after a wrenching scene last night. Udo's letter to boot. He's coming at Pentecost. Mainz (West Germany) June 1951 Udo to Rosie Dear Rosemarie! Sweet, your letter. The first I've liked from you in some time. No, you didn't write standoffishly! And you can safely ditch that political stuff. For I can read that in the Socialist daily. But just listen: I'm as interested in politics as in listening to opera. I've thought all the problems through. There's no 'ideal form of government'. Democracy is a lot of bollocks, dictatorship vile. People are uneducated and uninformed. That's all there is to it. They're also not selfish enough. They spoil the nicest weather with all their claptrap about improving our lot. I no longer read the newspaper. My goal is the world state. It's the only possible social system. Everything else is so insignificant that it's hardly worth getting excited over. Time will tell who is more mature politically, you or I. You're now at the stage I was back in 1942. Before things turned sour. There's no helping you, like me back then. So, feel free to indoctrinate the brainless. Within a few days, the proles will sell out your ideals for a load of booze or something! I'm studying law, for four years I've been learning how to be meticulous. And, we're getting screwed over right and proper. One more thing: kinship is ghastly. So petty-minded and spiteful. Dieter is great. Sometimes I've been sad, Mutzel. It's pathetic, you know? Hardly. Otherwise you wouldn't have sacrificed all my optimism in you for some poxy principles. I won't come for the World Fair Games. Otherwise I'd have to give up my position. There's no longer any freedom. Neither freedom of expression, nor any other form thereof. With your lot, it never existed in any form. Here, a modicum at least. Now I'm holding a picture of you to help against forgetfulness. It's from 1946. So lovely. Your eyes are trusting. When you sent it you wrote that you were still a virgin when it was taken. Why did you write that? To me, you're still such a good-natured, pure child as back then. There are few girls as honest and self-sacrificing as you. You must be a wonderful woman. You can't, however, have the freedom you desire. I am reactionary: the woman belongs to me. Equality is illogical, unnatural, and nonsensical. Besides, the man isn't free at all: he loves and desires her. My God, how happy I was with you! I'm in bed. Hardly a suitable place to write, for my cravings won't leave me alone. Do come in summer! I'll pick you up from the border. We could have such a fine time. On the Rhine, paddle boat etc., tent. Dieter, Mandi, none of your Youth Movement. Doing nothing, apart from four to five hours study daily. A bite to eat, then crawl into the tent. Paddle afterwards. Campfire. Your head in my lap, my fingers through your hair. How mean of you not to send me tender letters. You're not getting any either. Why should I confess everything and lay bare my poor heart, while you take comfort in knowing that, yet make sure to give nothing away. And it's lazy of you. When I'm at your place, you don't make me sit in the next room. That torments me. And, it's dishonest. You have these thoughts, too. In half-waking dreams you're kissing me, thank you! But heck, am I not allowed in on it? Blood is rushing to my head, so I'd better stop. Yours, Udo July 1951 Dear Rosemarie! I was on the verge of tears, for I've just read your letter and set eyes on the picture. Pentecost 1951. I think everything has broken-down. Love perturbs me greatly. Every now and then I feel I'm ablaze. How am I supposed to get to Berlin? Passport. Travel money. Time. Are you sad? Dear lass, I'm off to Criminal Law. The house is ready in 25 days. Mainz, late August 1951 Ever since they've taken to wearing jumpers in Parliament, they just sit around twiddling their thumbs. No, it's not worth talking about. Ça va pas. Have you ever met somebody who hasn't objected if you tell him he's just like everyone else? Hardly! Perhaps, that's how things stand with us too. We fill lines and pages with words, work something out and think that's swell and that the others also find it so, and then fancy ourselves as something special. Even if we don't say it aloud, or when nobody is in the room. Seen from a higher level, it might well look easier. Cast: Rosie, bar-counter politician, president to-be of the League of World Women. Udo: your average lawyer with tremendous plans in his shabby jacket pockets. Dieter: eternally befuddled studiosus rerum naturalium, living on hand-outs, partly parental, partly from his bride's possessions. Prone to a potbelly. Mandi: denizen of the Mainz underworld, for she was bombed-out. Shorthand typist with mediocre mental aptitudes. Very easy-going, but for all that superficial, of an amiably venal nature that would get on any sensible person's nerves in the ninth month. All acted out by us. A mediocre bunch. Somehow, I'm more inclined to greater things. I want to shoot 8mm movies. That'd be something. So what about a love affair behind cabin doors. You know, when we travel together, we always fall in love again. I'll slip in through the porthole and slip out again in the morning and sharks are down there. And sea cows. That'll be swell. When I make it rich we'll rent a cottage in the woods and I'll paint you there. You'll read aloud and I'll paint until I can't take it any longer. Then I'll screw you and afterwards we'll start all over again. I'll then think just how beautiful it is with this woman, but if she weren't there, I might well fancy seducing a sweet little 14-year-old, and you might think about a little half-Jew, and basically we're big jackasses. I can have things with you nobody else can offer. I might be disappointed again, or maybe not. Anyway, in 30 years, all of this will be over. Though the Pyrenees will still be standing. And this craving. Sometimes it makes me sick. Blue sky and drifting clouds, grass. White ruins. Well, Rosie, good night. We'll make use of the time, yes? Just how will we do it? November 1951 Furthermore, the Paris negotiations are done with. Your lot will write this and that. But they truly are a giant step forward. Yet again our State is a formidable factor. I could even employ that stupid term "Great Power." France is weaker, its colonies are toppling. The USA wants to hold on to us at all costs. They are afraid of the Russians. If Ivan doesn't attack, there will be no war. Here, they don't want it. Nor do the Yanks. I'm convinced that peace will hold. Things are going awry in Egypt, but the Tommies will triumph. And Mossadeq is having to fight his corner to hold on. The opposition is strong and the USA is waving dollar loans. But politics will need to have a rethink too. The American and Western policies are snail-paced, but very safe. If you ask me, the race has been won. There will be no war. The demise of the Soviet Bloc has begun, but it remains powerful and has many offshoots. It will die slowly. Or, transform itself. I assume that over time a brown sauce will emerge instead of a black and white one. How absurd that the USA doesn't accept China on the UN Security Council. Mao has a mind of his own. He is only a Soviet satellite as a matter of necessity. Old China was bad. The new one is better. And it's getting bad, too. In the long run all this cardboard-head-carrying-coercion is nothing. Here and there someone looks to the other side and is astonished that it works without activists. Works better. I don't like compulsion. Curse the church, but the Parties as well. Why did Alef give you flowers? To the devil with you. No, to me. After all, you're pretty cute. I want to rub my nose against yours. And bite off your canine teeth. Oops. No more space on this page. The West hasn't changed it policies one iota. World War II was a waste of time. It's still the same old story. Armament. Re-armament. Victory and then you're stone dead. In seven years, we destroy the world, in seven more we build a new one. It's jolly splendid. The chief demolishers get military medals, the chief rebuilders are activists. In the end, both sides will be left gobsmacked, wondering whether school's really out for them. By the way, I'm in smashing form. From time to time I enquire how the government's getting on, whether the Yanks are still in Korea, go paddling, and study law. At weekends I go dancing. Just like today. We're going to Bingen by car. My little Frenchwoman and me. But I think I still love you. Since your last letter, I've several times caught my subconscious getting accustomed to you once again. But that takes some time, Muzl. As long as you've broken that, you can patch it up again. You twit. Should we meet again, look for a room with soundproofed walls. I love you. We'll marry next year. Write at once. Udo We're now living in our houses. They're not big, are next to each other, but are rather pretty. I have three rooms and kitchen. 2 x 2 per floor. Bathroom with water closet. 70 Marks per month. Repayment included in the rent. Ownership in three years, 12,000 Marks mortgage. Garden 150 square meters. Upstairs, large room 5 by 3.60 and a smaller one 3.50 by 2.80. Unless we get married, I'll be in trouble with the housing office. In two years we'll get a car: a second-hand Volkswagen for 2,000 Marks. Engagement trip to Venice, or to Spain in spring, if I pass my exams. Can you get a passport over there? If you come along, we won't freeze. Yesterday, was in Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell Tolls." Ingrid Bergmann plays Marie. Outstanding. The ending is dissonant. It's good that way. Besides, it feels true-to-life: to be killed for someone you love is comforting. Don't you feel as if you're seeking to place your heart on ice? The frozen heart. Life begins with love and dies with it. If only you'd read a line of Seneca intelligently. I'll have to explain a thing or two to you. Please leave other men alone! I got a card from Paris today. A girl there costs 300 to 500 francs. There are Asian girls as well. I liked the mulattos best. Japanese women are adorable with their little bell-like voices. That's why I like you too, for your love tastes of guilty pleasures. That's what some others think of me. Perhaps it's even true. Oh, bugger it! Mum is quite fond of you. Sometimes she gingerly asks, but I don't give any answers, you pompous git! I'm not writing you another letter until you say "yes". But I'm sending you a thousand dreams in which I tear your hair out and have your flesh between my teeth. I'm looking forward to lying on your breast and talking of transparent materials. Feeling your lips and tongue. I don't want to miss out on any voluptuous torments, but your eyes glow too timidly and your breast and back are restless. Luckily, we can't accuse each other of being fish-blooded. Yet, it's also pleasant as the great silence comes on. When we're tired and seek each other out, for we're afraid of the void. That's how it is. Ça va. An entire lifetime. Feel your heart. Can you hear how it throbs? Your heart doesn't belong to you. You're tearing it asunder. Don't just follow your head, nothing underneath. But I've been waiting for so long, it hurts. Time flies. Happiness is a weathervane and thrifty. Let me embrace you. Yours, Udo By the way: I've always held our legal system in high esteem. It hasn't caved in under political pressure. Be quiet, you don't know it. But now here in the West they're attacking the independent, free judge who has passed rulings against the State. Freedom is also coming under fire here. Nor does Konrad Adenauer want a unified Germany. It would spell the end for Kaiser Konrad the First. I've already torn up two letters. Unless you finally come to your senses and help me to think of you and to believe in you, I'll no longer be able to write to you in half a year. I was at loggerheads with Dieter over you. Are you afraid or bothered, or don't you want to give up your profession, or what do you want? You've got to imagine you're standing opposite me while you answer. Letters are a substitute for the conversation we can't have due to the border between our States. It's truly beyond me how you can still work with such a shower of idiots. You can't be that daft. You once asked me what I'd do if I was called up. What will you do? The military here isn't sizable, 12 divisions, 250,000 men. On top of some 100,000 border guards. Here in the West everyone knows damn well that the armed forces are a great evil. But they're the lesser evil. The greater one is your regime. You yourself stated that they might want to free us by force if necessary. As long as they refrain from doing so, you've no need to fear the Wehrmacht. Besides, you lot have a comparable military unit. Sometimes at night I think of you for hours on end. Shall we meet or will I go to France? Guess it'll have to be France, for you've done nothing to stop me and my patience has run dry. 1948 until 52, that's an eternity. Like flowers in bloom, it can all rapidly come tumbling down once the major obstacle is removed, namely, my willingness to wait. May 1952 I sat my final exam and got good grades. I'm heading outdoors to stretch my limbs again. Are you a tad pleased, my little Communista? Your second-last letter drew a line under our life together thus far. Feel free to scout around for another man. I'm letting you go. I kiss your tanned neck. Yours, Udo November 1952 Rosie's diary I'm still living with Ernst and have a feeling that it doesn't bode well for me. Never before have I felt that I've harmed my soul in similar relationships to this one, or I've become more vulnerable in this regard. It'll be good when I move out. Ernst has played havoc with my self-confidence. I'm coming to terms with the fact that I'm "being taken for a ride" on the margins. Ernst may well laugh at such thoughts and quip that I'm complicating everything yet again. He'd also probably deny taking "me for a ride" by alluding to our friendship, which only exists in his imagination, in all sincerity for sure. But for me it's nothing other than the carnal reaction to his physical type. His very presence triggers in me the most contradictory doubts about my feelings. When he sleeps, he's always first out, I inquisitively look at his calm face, his relaxed hand on my shoulder, and wonder whether I want to kiss or to strangle him at that moment. I haven't a clue about his inner workings. For him, women are first and foremost women, too; for they're beautiful to touch and the source of immediate pleasures, are understandable and manageable after a few nights. It's too much trouble to determine what they have on the inside. So why even bother? Besides, they like to complicate things, leading to discussions, and these are time-consuming. It's best to kiss them, so they stop their nonsense and become as normal as one wishes. I've got to leave him, soon! Udo wrote. He thinks we ought to have married at least two years ago. Then what? I'd be just as miserable, just differently. And perhaps there'd be a little Udo trotting around. My circumstances haven't changed a whit. "For Whom the Bell Tolls", Hemingway. In its fullest sense, it's more dangerous than a reactionary book. Such insidious poison and no wonder it hasn't gone into print here. "And Quietly Flows the Don" has passages with a similar sense of resignation, but behind them is the comforting knowledge that the Russian Revolution ultimately triumphed, while in Spain it culminated with Franco's victory. Hemingway's novel is ghastly and grandiose. I read it in one sitting. It's utterly pernicious. Every single line implicitly contains the corrosive indication of the futility of it all. It's nothing but the irrefutable insight into the impossibility of disentangling the events that make up our existence, events that shape us while we pretend to create them. Why the hell am I sometimes surprised by my generation, by the fact it's patently obvious that most would have nothing against another war! It'd make life easy for us all, it would simplify matters in the most obvious way. December 1952 He insisted on accompanying me. We barely spoke, and not a word over the last metres. So, I said goodbye on the doorstep, and in response he kissed me and stood there in silence. I explained briefly and without further ado that I couldn't take him back to my place, for I wasn't living alone. I accompanied him back to the station. When he asked if I'd come with him, I instantly said yes, although he went on to say that the last train had left. We walked and walked, the road seemed never-ending. It was after two when we got there. Wolfgang led me to his room, and while I looked around, I heard him talking with his mother. I realised that I'd have to greet her in the morning and how awkward that would be. While all this was going through my mind, my eyes skimmed over countless book-spines that covered all four walls of the room to the ceiling. Books were also piled up on the desk, and two cats were wandering around among scripts and magazines. He came, and we drank tea, smoked and remained silent. We then lay down in the dark and he just kept saying my name, over and again. When I clumsily reminded him of certain precautions, he asked in an urgent tone if I was determined not to have a child. I asked him the same and he replied yes with vehemence leaving me so startled, astonished and confused that I had no reply. We slept for about an hour. After I washed, the moment had come to face his mother. Edith's kindness made it easy for me to be calm and unselfconscious. Wolfgang wandered about, looking for things, leafing books. He then put on wonderful recordings of opera and Schubertlieder. He sat there engrossed, stirring his tea, and ignoring his mother's warnings to hurry. In the end, it was too late, and he was still looking for his things. I was in the institute at half-past nine. The day felt endless. In the evening yet another lecture and the Party's training program awaited me. When I got home, Ernst was already in bed, very tired much to my relief. Since that Sunday, Wolfgang has been in my thoughts every single hour. As for him? He says nothing, not a word about it. He asked me the evening I wrote this down, if I'd move in with him. I'll have to share him with his work, perhaps even with other women one day. He'll sometimes be so distant to the point of incomprehension. September 1963 Gerd Semmer, Düsseldorf To Rosemarie Heise Neue Deutsche Literatur Berlin W8, Friedrichstrasse 169 Dear Frau Heise, Enclosed are the two poems I promised you. I've just completed them. I do hope you like them. Where possible, please retain the use of lowercase letters. I've just finished reading a proper novel: "Divided Heaven". Please give my regards to Christa when you bump into her. I happily think back to that hot day in your house, when I was so awfully worn-out. What particularly struck me was how warily and calmly your two lads were clobbering each other. They'll be good fighters and we'll have need of those too. Cordially yours, Gerd Semmer In Memoriam Wolfgang Heise 1995, Christa Wolf Once, at the beginning of the sixties, Wolfgang and I happened to be spending several weeks at the same sanatorium in south-east Berlin. It was a sanctuary of sorts for a certain species of Berlin intellectual, for those who had at first internal, then increasingly external confrontations with measures or institutions of the State or of the Party, to which most of them belonged, plunging them into conflicts and crises that often manifested themselves through psychosomatic complaints. The doctors listened to their litanies, prescribed vegetarian food, Kneipp's water therapy, and above all long walks. In my case, cardiac issues. Was it Wolfgang's stomach? Or perhaps the heart already, which failed him in the end? Neither of us could sleep. So, we teamed up for long walks, breathing the fragrant air of the pine forests around the Märkish village, relishing the autumnal landscape and talking, talking. We made an initial assessment of the desolate years following the revelations about Stalin. Somewhat obsessively, we pitted doctrine against praxis, citing ever-newer examples. I still recall passing through a pine grove, and the oblique slant of the autumnal sunbeams when Wolfgang said we need to be clear about one thing: this State, like any State, is an instrument of domination, and its ideology, like all ideology: false consciousness. We stood still. I clearly recall asking: "What should we do?" We were silent for some time until finally he replied: "Remain decent." That wasn't a mission statement, but I've often thought about it. We both had to deal with conflicts arising from that stance in our respective spheres. These often brought him, I believe, to the brink of what he could stomach and go along with. Whenever I met Wolfgang he struck me as strained, the lines on his face deeper and sagging, his features etched with an expression of almost solidified seriousness. We didn't see each other so often during those years. He was living outside Berlin and working at the university. Yet I always felt close to him. We'd ring each other every now and then. He was very reserved and never talked about himself. One rarely heard anything about his childhood or youth. End of December 1963 Wolf Biermann Dear Wolfgang Heise! To ring in 1964, I hope that you needn't be too shocked by my exam results. Warm greetings to your wife and to your two boys, who, as I gathered back then, were very pleased with the wealth of ideas in my songs. Back then, at least. Yours, Biermann Don't wait for better times Don't wait with your hat Like the fool on the riverbank Who day after day waits For the forever-flowing waters To run dry Memorandum for a dossier concerning a discussion between Dr Heise, Humboldt University and Comrade Schwiegerhausen, State Secretariat for Higher and Technical Education on February 11, 1964 at 11.30 a.m. At the beginning of the discussion, Comrade Heise communicated that he had received a certificate of appointment, instructing him to take over operations of the Vice Rector for Social Sciences. Comrade Heise indicated that he expects a decision from us concerning the commencement of his duties on Monday, February 17. Comrade Doctor Schwiegerhausen stated that in his opinion, Comrade Heise's misgivings about implementing Party policy at the Humboldt University furnished ample grounds to believe that he wasn't properly filling his role as Vice Rector. In reply, Comrade Heise stated that a removal could be solely executed by official means, for he had not been appointed at his own suggestion, and the Secretary of State must set out the grounds for dismissal to the Senate of Humboldt University, and to the Rector. Humboldt University Berlin The Rector Berlin W8, Unter den Linden 6 March 23, 1964 To Professor Dr Wolfgang Heise, Institute for Philosophy Dear Colleague, Following the appointment of Professor Dr Arnold as Vice-Rector for Social Sciences, I, in agreement with the State Secretary for Higher and Technical Education, herewith relieve you of your duties from the position of Vice-Rector for Social Sciences at Humboldt University with effect from March 16, 1964. I wish you every success with the continuation of your academic work. With collegial greetings, Professor, Dr habil Sanke Two years later, March 1966 Socialist Unity Party of Germany Draft resolution It has emerged that Comrade Heise, member of our group, positioned himself against forthright struggle and the harshest condemnation of Havemann, Tzschoppe, and Biermann. Two years ago, Comrade Heise did not feel it right that Havemann be expelled from the Party. Inadvertently, our officials did not thoroughly discuss this matter with him. While Comrade Heise did submit a statement against Havemann to the General Assembly, the underlying principles and causes of his erratic attitude were not satisfactorily clarified. Our group was informed of details of Comrade Heise's attitude at the General Assembly on March 2. In particular that he had refused to sign a letter to UNITA, which requested the correction of an article describing Havemann's role in the German Democratic Republic, and in which the work of the philosophical institutions of our State was rendered completely distorted and disformed. Comrade Heise does not want to admit the detrimental effect his behaviour has on the Party's objectives and on the struggle for ideological purity. In practice, his rejection of this joint action and of an open political condemnation of Havemann, Biermann, and Tzschoppe is tantamount to support for these people. We can only see Comrade Heise's attitude as nothing but an attitude of petty misgivings and intellectualistic dogmatism, which disregards democratic centralism and the unity of the Party. To what extent this attitude is based upon Comrade Heise's mistaken and dissenting views on fundamental issues of our Party's national politics, on the path to victory by socialism under our conditions, and the ensuing tactical necessities, will have to be clarified by Comrade Heise stating his position to our group. We intend to do everything to ensure that Comrade Heise re-integrates himself into the group and adopts an unambiguous attitude in line with the Party's current policy. We emphasize that the conclusion to which the discussion will lead will depend, above all, on Comrade Heise himself. Rosie to Wolf in Ahrenshoop My little Wolf, Sweetheart, I couldn't prevent them from going to you, believe me. I was awfully upset, but I just can't judge what's right in this case. Please understand that. I didn't want to give them your address. Don't let all that get to you. My dear, none of it matters. I'm so distraught that I can't be at your side. Please don't take it tragically, don't be ever so dreadfully German, be Viennese about it and just give them the finger. All three mean well. They, too, are under pressure and are frightened. Frightened. I'll call you tonight, after ten. Will that be alright? I'll try. Yours, Little Rosie We were 12 or 13 at the time, boys and girls, and broke open the door of the abandoned cinema. The parquet was long since removed, the theatre empty. Hormone-fuelled adolescents, we crept through the dark, seeking each other out. For us, forbidden fruit. We sensed each other's presence by listening or following cigarette tips glowing in hands and mouths. Not a sound apart from our breathing and fumbling footsteps. We stretched out our arms into the darkness so as to touch each other. For hours on end... I came in contact with another body. Awkwardly, we tried to kiss. We recognized each other in the act. It was my brother. Andreas. In sheer disgust, we shoved each other away. April 1966 My Sweet Wolf, I can now admit that I'd secretly hoped that your decision would be so. You can't feel as bad, and if you do, it won't be for much longer, as if you'd have acted otherwise. I'm ever so happy about it, for I believe myself thoroughly grounded and unromantic. I'm also so relieved that no family-related considerations influenced you. That would have gnawed at me terribly. There's no reliable prognosis as to what will come of all this. What storms, scandals, and outrages haven't eventually petered out. Still, come what may, I feel thoroughly ready to stare steely into life's tight-lipped countenance, as long as you are by my side, in whatever way possible. Two things are now critical. Firstly, for you to build up strength for the upcoming procedures, and I can help you with that. Secondly, you must consider an objective, justifiable, and clearly fixable standpoint, in which there are no weaknesses, with which you can make new detailed decisions in any situation without hesitation or strain on your nerves. After A, you can only say B, and not let yourself be persuaded that you might just have wanted to say "ouch". At best I'll be able to help you in a vague moral sense with that. But my depression, a mere foreshadow of these current problems, is behind me now and I'm almost glad that the ominous silence has also lifted, and that things are finally in motion. I'm enclosing a card which your eldest boy sent from holiday camp. I was so reassured that he seems to have a mind of his own, albeit rarely visible, and a relationship with his father. Besides, he must be slowly getting sick and tired of me. Please drop him a small card. Show him you're grateful and proud, it's important. My dear, warmest regards, I embrace you. As always, yours, Little Rosie September 6, 1966 Wolfgang to the Rector of Humboldt University, Professor Dr habil Sanke. On the Premises Magnificence, I hereby request to be discharged from the functions of Dean. Regrettably, my state of health leaves me with no other option. My ability to work has not yet been fully re-established. The fragmentation of powers necessarily associated with the Dean's duties might well re-induce the conditions underlying the sickness. I extremely regret this decision. It was reached following in-depth consultations with the physicians in light of developments over recent months. With Socialist greetings, Heise December 14, 1970 Andreas, homework Presentation of my Development I'm 16 years old. I dream of turning 18, just as, at 12, I dreamt of turning 14. My 16th birthday didn't change anything for me. Well, I'm allowed to smoke and buy beer. Yet, when I insisted that my headmaster address me as Mr. Heise, he roared me out of it. That's just how it is when you're 16. I have the makings of everything in me. Everything. However, that could also mean nothing. The word "develop" probably implies that something emerges from a shell and takes shape, something, which was previously there, but only gradually becomes visible. In my case, will something be visible? What? My arrival in this world brought joy to many, especially to my mother of course. But she had a rough time, for my birth was a forceps delivery. Years later, whenever I'd get angry, and I got angry very often, a red spot appeared on my forehead. Why did often I have tantrums? The year after my brother was born. Something began, which I regret to this day, but yet can't explain. I took a dislike to him. There was no reason for that, but I couldn't help it. He didn't do anything to me. If anything, he once saved my life. Even now, if I deliberately suppress this dislike, it still surfaces sometimes.

My radio operator's name is Florath. Cordon off streets with red flags in the firing sector for howitzers and low-flying aircraft. 4:30: Report standby Time to start a hellfire. We were instantly warm. I plonked myself down by the fire and conked. How the hell was I to know that Florath would also conk out right away. 8:00 to 9:30 then block the road. National Road. Vehicle Columns. Also a caravan from the West. Jerks from West Berlin's Socialist Unity Party, who wanted to get to Schollener Lake Nature Reserve. Ornithologists. Sergeant Major does control round telling us to forget about lunch. He's already half-pissed on Boonecamp Bitters. Then a Trabant pulls up and out steps Schulze, my buddy from the nearest checkpoint. Snappy powwow: Do we wanna, don't we wanna? We wanna! So, red flag out. Another Trabant. Hitch a ride to Schollehne. To the local boozer. PLEASE TAKE A NUMBER Guzzled down a bunch of beers at lightning speed, bought a crate, stopped another car, and vamoose. Got to Florath's checkpoint, hid crate with leftover beer. Heard that Sergeant Major had already been and missed me. Couldn't give a toss. 7:00 p.m.: Block road for half-an-hour. Then lay down by cosy little fire and just opened my mouth to knock another one back. 11.00 p.m.: Commando signal: pack up, we're coming to get you. Threw all the junk into a pile and waited for the truck. Truck here. Sergeant Major ranting. Then, off to Oranienburg. Monday now deemed Sunday. So, a lie in. That's my brief report today.

The sand hereabouts is yellower and a propeller looks fancy on my cap. The houses here are dry wood and multi-functional, but the forest can't be cleared, for it's grown over concrete. I came across a pit with horse bones, oily bomb craters, and the remains of Werner von Braun's villa. Science fiction. Read Borges and you'll know what it's like in Peenemünde. On the other hand, we have rats. I'm now free to stand sentry. For half a year, at least. Often several days at a go. The food can be stomached, no more. And not for long. It often ran right through me or got stuck somewhere, was unpleasant. After being told I carry the sub-machine gun like a forester, I'm keeping an eye out for the woodland animals, while walking the runway in the rain in the strongest winds. I'm broke to boot, and got no more cigarettes and think about who I'm going to bum off this evening. Actually, it's all for the best. Thomas Thomas to Rosie and Wolf Given we have two chiefs in this barracks, as many as roe-deer, the orders keep coming. Each playing at it as mightily as he can. We have the pleasure of being constantly on the trot. Suspension training over pools of oil, bomb craters and other unpleasant things. I'm forever thirsty and trying to get fruit. Political training again today, at which the aged captain explained that the prerequisite of Socialism is Christianity. Propaganda films non-stop. Our marching song, too. In our pent-up frustration it becomes mere screams. And there are grades for bed-making, hailed as a true Socialist contest. The swearing-in ceremony is tomorrow. Obviously, the marching and the rest won't pass muster. A few have been discharged as unfit. Somebody with a wooden leg and another with only one lung. We've organized some brew and will indulge ourselves with bread rolls and brew. Dear Family of Comrades, With a deep breath I began this Sunday, naturally blessed with blue skies, on which I, a first-time voter, proceeded to the voting booth before breakfast after an unforgettable morning roll call. Curious to know the candidates' names, we stood in front of the opening door. A small orchestra banged out one hit after another. Smiling majors and lieutenants with "please" and "thanks." Hearts glowed with pleasure over malt coffee at the breakfast table afterwards. Leisurely stroll without any marching back to the barracks. Sports festival there. There was even ice cream. Then followed the popular "smiles with miles," with another 24 to follow. But the class enemy struck. A rat bite in the nape of the neck. Our political officer knew the right plan of attack: We no longer place our boots in front of the bunk but rather next to it, so we can slip into our boots quicker whenever a rat is spotted by guards armed with spades. We then drive the rat into a corner. The same officer is well trained all-round and delivered some comrades a talk on how to polish shoes. Not to ruin the shoe-polish's paste-like texture. During nuclear strikes one cowers like an elongated bundle under plastic bags and waits. Pig's liver day in day out. They even served it with noodles, disgusting. Villagers! To bring this hatred and suffering to an end, we need to reconstruct our land. A new society without landowners and capitalists! In order to clothe, nourish, and educate our poor children we all need to join forces to fight for the Revolution! The Korean Revolutionary Army is fighting for our native land, so that our people can live happily in freedom. damit unser Volk glücklich in Freiheit leben kann! Andreas to Rosemarie Oranienburg, First Motorized Rifle Division December 3, 1974 Despite tranquilizers, pretty angst-ridden lines. At a time we need warmth and can't get any, we're happy if it's available all the same, even if comes from a bottle. That's why this signatory won't be in the mire for much longer. It was worse in the urban jungle, searching, straying, hoping and never finding the one with whom you not only share a bed, but also the flu and lousy times. There's Anatol, you and Jutta, and now you're thinking, where's father? But that's another matter altogether. We, Father and I, find the dialogue between us that's possible, but I feel his presence with an almost physical intensity. Always. He's present, and I can't tell him that I'm fond of him as he is, even when he erupts at lunch. Perhaps his world, despite the various points of contact, is too remote from mine. Nevertheless, we're always a bit embarrassed when we're alone together. I'm reading like a madman. Andreas Neighbourhood Surveillance Report December 1976 Heise, Wolfgang, is known in the neighbourhood as a member of the Socialist Unity Party. Social activities or initiatives are lacking. In connection with preparations for elections in 1976, he was commissioned, to deliver election notices along with another comrade. He then assigned this task to his wife, who suddenly fell ill, resulting in the work having to be taken over by the other comrade. A red flag is permanently visible on the balcony of his house. According his son, it is meant to demonstrate his solidarity with the working class. His children were raised by H. in a progressive fashion. Both of them did their honorary service in the National People's Army. In this context, there have been disputes with the Heise family in the past. The children emerged as ringleaders of juvenile gangs. The parents refused to take action. It's conspicuous that the family frequently receives visitors who arrive by car. This usually takes place in the evening hours, and in some cases light has been observed in the house up until 5 a.m. In terms of appearance, there have also been persons with a southern complexion, possibly Turks or Arabs. The Heise family doesn't own a car. Both of them come and go by taxi. Despite her age, Frau Heise dresses very youthfully and elegantly. Sources: Comrade K. née. G., wife of an employee of the Ministry for State Security Object Gosen, Division F. This family lives opposite the Heise family and has already been deployed operationally. Comrade W., Chairman of the Neighbourhood Party Committee, lives behind the H. home. Comrade W., retired Colonel and holder of the Patriotic Order of Merit Gold Medal. Comrade E., civilian employee at the Ministry for State Security, Division F, head of the residential facility. Comrade L., her husband, an invalid pensioner from the Ministry for State Security. Comrade F., civilian employee at the Ministry for State Security, Hessenwinkel Party School. Located approx. 300m from the H. home. June 1966 Rosie to Heiner Müller Dear Heiner, Despite our mere nodding acquaintance, I was delighted that you were willing to give me Borges' "Labyrinths". Many thanks! I had wanted to write to you anyway, but I lacked the courage, for I was unsure whether you even remembered me, or whether right now you might only greet everything, even the best-intentioned phrases, with impatience and polite weariness. Which I could well appreciate. I never visited or fell into conversation with Inge. I saw her on only two or three occasions. Once when you were booted out of the German Writers' Association. It might strike you as odd if I say that she left a profound, precise, and lasting impression. I could see that here was a human being for whom living was difficult and whom the constant headwinds left gasping, no matter what way she turned. I can well understand her ultimate act, as I count myself among that minority for whom attempting such an act of freedom just once during this lifetime doesn't unleash awkward embarrassment or even revulsion. I do indeed grieve, should that decision be the result of distress that otherwise seems interminable, and not the result of an effective use of absolute free will. "Human beings are to be pitied." From "A Dream Play" by Strindberg. "Labyrinths" fascinates me particularly after reading the latest novel by Aragon, "La Mise à mort". Aragon apparently was also inspired by Borges' form of mirror motif. Incidentally, an entire chapter of this truly astonishing novel contains the enactment of the Oedipus motif and of the Oedipus fable in various present day social settings, which constantly reflects on whether it is even possible to set such a theme in a contemporary setting without resorting to sensationalism or surrealism. Dear Heiner, we are deeply interested in your adaptation of Oedipus, and we read "Philoctetes" with interest. We would like to discuss both with you. You are more than welcome to visit us, should you ever feel like having such a conversation. Wolfgang would like to get to know you. Here in any case is our number: 64 90 27 You're sure to find us home until mid-July, also during the day. Cordially, Rosie and Wolfgang Heise So, the final position as formulated in "Fatzer", is actually: "From now on and for some time yet there will no longer be victors in this world, but only the vanquished." This wording dates from 1932, and the "fear centre," if you like, was the fear of the irresolvable clinch of revolution and counterrevolution. Brecht had thereby anticipated a position that is relevant to this day in a general sense: In the age of nuclear weapons, there can be no more victors. That's one aspect, but the other is that this victory-defeat dialectic is obviously something that each of us must live through individually in his living and work environment. Perhaps... You quoted a poem from "Fatzer" earlier on. Have you recorded that? - He's acting all formal here. Sorry... - We can edit that afterwards... So you quoted the "Fatzer" poem. Brecht expressed that more intensely, and more objectively in a poem, "Come, Fatzer". It should be in here somewhere, if I'm not... This is... Yes... "One who is beaten does not escape wisdom. Hold on tight and sink! Be afraid! Go on, sink! At the bottom, the lesson awaits you. You who were asked too many questions Receive now the inestimable teaching of the masses: Take up your new post." Naturally, teaching by the masses doesn't merely entail taking their opinions into consideration, but rather their actual behaviour. And that we ourselves may become part of the masses in the process. Yes, that as well. What straight away comes to mind is one only has to beat someone long enough and he won't get round to thinking. Nobody likes jackboots stomping in their faces, and that isn't just Brecht's individual opinion. And yet, there's a harrowing experience that people can survive repeated violence, but be utterly changed by it. And I think, the limits of manipulation need to be constantly redefined in every conflict situation. And in that context I also found it fascinating that"The Days of the Commune" and "The Life of Galileo" are structured like a tragedy, both pieces. Both depict the tragedy of modern socialism, namely, the separation of knowledge and power. I think this line of argument is quite open to debate. But only if we take into account the knowledge of power and the powerlessness of knowledge in the process. And the very fact we find it so difficult to come to terms with proves just how valid that argument is. Can we take a short break? In any case we still have to consider how we'll then proceed. It'll be a little all over the place... - That doesn't matter. These digressions are quite useful, I think. Please don't start just yet, I'm unsure how my train of thought will evolve. Then it might be a good moment to start recording, because the search for the thread can yield something. Start recording again. Well, you're directing matters anyway. When I consider Brecht's dramas post-"Fatzer" the author himself is never the primary subject matter of the dramatic presentation. When I consider Müller's dramas, not only is the author always personally involved, but he directly becomes the subject matter. The question is then, how intensified objectivity can be grasped through an intensification of subjectivity. So that the relationship between subjectivity and objectivity changes. There's also a banal aspect: since Brecht, people have become more suspicious of indoctrination. For reasons we aren't personally responsible for. So if we want to communicate something using the same dramaturgy as Brecht's, then we'd better be ready for people to say: Your talk is cheap. And the message doesn't get across. So for people to listen, you have to speak about yourself. And about your own relationship to the subject matter. Another point in this episode, Virginia reads the 15th epigraph: "Man is too brittle", Whereupon Galileo retorts: "Not brittle enough." That's a very important point. - Definitely. We witness that every day. The shock and astonishment at how much people put up with. That is what perpetuates such dire situations, the fact that "man is not brittle enough," that man stomachs too much. What is also very surprising, that Galileo, and here, I think, he's very much a mouthpiece for Brecht, he doesn't respond to the 37th epigraph: "God has created man like a shadow. Who can judge him once the sun has set?" Galileo remains silent. And here is, I believe, Brecht's experience with living conditions under a dictatorship, namely in Germany. Where it's no longer that easy to condemn people on a moral basis. No judgement is past here. And you keep recording us relentlessly! Thomas, notebook 1987 Unrecorded scene at Heiner's His son's visit He's come seeking help, after his schoolteacher's demand that he, like everyone in his class, sign a letter of intent to become a reserve officer in the East German Army. Like a visit from another world. Heiner feels his son's misgivings, and his own, toward his detached answer after a lengthy pause: "Sign and wait and see." Then, the speechless farewell. The shame. And then we head for the Zoo, an hour of silence in the crocodile house. To Wolf Leipzig, December 1980 Dearest Wolf! Pay heed! I'm writing this letter late at night, hot-headed and with a slightly aching body. So, don't expect anything sensible, correctly spelt. I'm writing to you, for I'm thinking of you, must overcome myself to seek out words that mediate between tenderness and detachment, which will get to you and touch you and allow us to forget the gaping gulf between us, but also to let your heart know of my hurt at your long silence and forgetfulness and indifference, or at least to bring it home to you. In moments of weakness, and I'm still susceptible to them, the thought of you and of Rosie was like a heartache, but I've also come to understand and experienced that whenever passion's flames start to flicker and fail, the scabs become thicker and harder, and separate one person from the other, even though, or because, that other was the most beloved. Today, I'm perhaps writing to you like an old woman still roused a little by her past feelings, triumphs and failures, or rather in the awareness of the full, yet always prudent yearning for love or for life that makes me soar, suffer, and live, and that also lets me reach out and take your hand again. Wolfgang, here things turn negative and you risk being dragged into the dust of murky promises or dumb platitudes. I would love to see you and for you to see me. In ways, this letter also lets me flip out of my current life, whose problems and complexity I can mostly cope with, and to leap into myself. In Leipzig, I could hardly allow myself the pleasure of self-reflection, I don't have the luxury of an inner life and respond to those now part of my life in such a way that their love, rejection, and suffering screen me completely, leaving nothing of me to be seen or felt. But in myself, I feel a great helplessness and a fear tying knots around my heart. That fear should've kept me from having children, but perhaps you can't understand that. What's more it doesn't interest you. Do you still have a shred of interest in me? You can scarcely rise to an answer and I don't mean that in the skin-deep sense, which you obviously can't own up to. I'm not asking you, as I would on the phone, about work or what you're reading, but rather about how you're feeling, how the things you see and hear affect you. I'd so like to talk with you. But you, too, know, that's not easy. I hug and salute you and don't answer this letter. Have it as a keepsake. Rosie's diary July 1988 Thomas was here, with Manfred. Why am I so sad after his visits? Is it the impossibility of reattaching the umbilical cord? Perhaps because he's emphasizing the rupture when he's here with Manfred, who sits quietly and languidly at his side, letting his Caravaggio-like eyes roam while Thomas speaks. On Sunday a spontaneous trip to West Berlin, where the Heiner Müller workshop came to a close and a conclusion. Discussion in the House of Literature. Actually wanted go to the theatre to see "Volokamsk Highway", but couldn't say"no" when Heiner, as though a matter of course, sweeps me into the car and off to the café where he is due to read from the play. I feel straight away that he's utterly exhausted and has been drinking. Given the long intervals between our encounters in recent years, I see in quick-motion age altering his physique. The squat, the peculiar as well as balancing step, a movement of the shoulders trying to avoid potentially-sharp pain; his stiffened back seems to be shrinking into his erstwhile longer neck. I'm thoroughly overcome by fear and love. Grief, helplessness in the double sense, for he can't be helped; and who indeed can? He's taken to wearing a suit and, worse still, he talks of money. For one minute we hold each other by the hand, silently, in the car, the best minute of this day, at the end of which I drive home gloomy and restless. He is world-famous and nothing, nothing will gratify that hunger for recognition, for love, built up during his squalidly depressing childhood. And I also see the fear breathing down his neck. The self-destructive way he treats himself has something infernally obsessed about it. He's like someone fascinated to observe a drowning man, who is none other than himself. It was close to midnight. The channel led to a large open garage that I only recognized as such once I stepped into this white concrete room. To the left and right of me the others were standing side by side, their faces to the wall. I can still hear the barking: "Faster, faster!" and "Form a middle row!" I no longer recall the moment I stepped into the garage, nor its door. The sides of the channel we had passed through one by one, suddenly and unexpectedly turned into whitewashed concrete. I can still see myself briskly marching through a channel of policemen, holding rubber truncheons, ready to lash out. We marched about 30 metres to a ramp. Dawn was breaking. I ran over the ramp and from there came into the corridor of a building. On the left an open toilet door. While I was trying to pee, two policemen stood at my back, holding their rubber truncheons just like those policemen who'd formed the cordons. I didn't manage to pee. I then ran back across the hall and ramp, through the channel to my garage. I recall the image of those quavering bodies around me, gently swaying. Sometimes one would fall asleep, then jar awake once his body began to fully lose balance. Around 10 a.m. we were led out of the garage in groups of two into a building. We were searched one at a time and one after the other. Three chirpy women noted down the contents of our pockets in lists, which had to be signed. I recall the curiously exuberant working atmosphere in this smoke-filled room. Of interest was any reason to detain me longer, and any ringleaders I would name, which I didn't. Not of interest was the violence by the thugs I saw rushing on the crowd retreating between armed personnel carriers with protective shields and double lines of police. Not of interest was that I witnessed how the men and women they indiscriminately snatched from that crowd were dragged across the main street and beaten up, and how they were wrenched behind police lines, behind which they vanished. Stop saying "we", said one of the interrogators; just say"I"! I was let go at around 4.30 p.m. I took the underground to Alexanderplatz and then the train to the theatre for the evening rehearsal of "Germania Death in Berlin". I still recall the phrase: "You knew that this would happen." January 17, 1991 Christa Wolf to Rosie Dear Rosemarie, Well, as of yesterday the problems of our erstwhile country have taken a back seat to a war. Yes, they are insane, but when the majority of humanity clings to this madness or looks on, it becomes normality, apparently. You ask if I've managed to retain my"strong core"? I don't know. This unremitting campaign over the last year has indeed taken its toll on me, some sort of basic trust has gone, or whatever vestiges of it, and I can now no longer imagine publishing for such an alleged readership. At present I'm not writing. I'm paralysed. I can no longer rise to the kind of self-exposure that used to inform my writing. What now lies ahead? A Pax Americana in any case. This will be the new world order, and its rulers will configure things in such a way that our beloved planet will perish along with them. There you have my optimism in a nutshell. Within three months of us belonging to the "other camp", they are dragging us into a war. America is raising its hind paw, urine marking its patch. Oh Mensch, I could go on writing like this a while longer. I embrace you. Your Christa February 1993 Rosie to Christa Wolf in Santa Monica, California Dear Christa, I've been meaning to write to you for some time, long before the media once again elected you as the object of their desire, after you stood by Heiner. I read with joy that you hadn't abandoned Heiner to face the anticipated fury alone, and with anxiety, for I saw coming what came about. Still, as Shakespeare readily recognized reality largely surpasses fiction when things go haywire. Personally, I was profoundly affected by your disclosures, for what I experienced at the beginning of 1961, hence before the Berlin Wall, as your successor at Neue Deutsche Literatur corresponded to a T with your experience of that apparatus. Everything proceeded exactly as you describe it, and even my conduct in no way differed from yours. A youngish man turned up at the editorial office, of painstakingly inconspicuous appearance in a non-descript suit, pulled out his badge and posed that question you're familiar with. I vacillated for a fraction of a second, for anything faintly conspiratorial is repugnant to me. I was supposed to address the man as "Werner", but I avoided any form of address. The information that he wanted concerned my colleagues on the editorial staff, including one with whom I had a brief, ardent affair. I had to assume that this was known to him and could be exploited lest I refuse. I was hoping to be adept in my counterattack, and thus was willing and signed. Incidentally, under my own name. I know full well there never was any question of a code name. That's the very point, dear Christa, that horrified me about your interview, for it was utterly incomprehensible to me how one can forget or even suppress such matters. I was convinced that everything stemming from our sense of identity is absolutely not forgettable, however much we would like to do so. When I asked Wolfgang how to extricate myself, he answered calmly: "Just say you no longer want part of it, you'll see, they'll accept that, you've just got to be resolute." He was right, at least for the time being, for as of 1965 we were the ones under observation. But your interview, it was probably the first you gave, I didn't see any others, I found too defensive. Everything hinges, as is largely the case with others as well, on two false premises: equating the Nazis with the Communist "executioners" you associated yourself with, and complete ignorance of the reality of the Cold War before the mid-sixties. After all, we deemed the Stasi appropriate and necessary, yet we came to see firstly what gradually became of our State, and secondly of the Stasi, and we didn't believe this insight initially, didn't want to believe it. The other false premise is to place both on an equal footing. The matter is all the more complicated, for the dead are just that, dead, irrespective of whether they were killed as supposed enemies of some lofty human ideal, or due to a criminal, inhumane doctrine at the outset. US AGAINST THEM The reason I swiftly picked up on contradictions that you only became aware of at a later stage is probably due to my antifascist upbringing. My self-confidence, however, was too low to seriously trust these insights, and above all, to work through the conflicts they confronted me with, and the outcome was an ever more perfect schizophrenia. Christa, I'm all over the place. I'll wrap it up here, otherwise there'll be another 20 pages or more. Still, I wonder if it might make sense one day to unravel this ball of thread, or if it'd merely be needless self-torture. But I'd so love to talk to you someday, perhaps also because the differences in your and my viewpoints back then might just help me recognize certain things more clearly. With a warm embrace for old time's sake, Rosemarie Frankfurter Rundschau "The Shores of the Barbarians" by Heiner Müller A Yugoslav tells me: At the weekends men from Belgrade go shooting in Bosnia. I tell that to a German of Jewish descent. He says: a Croat told that story. He's right: the narrator sees himself as Croat ever since the Serbian War. I first saw Godard's film "Weekend" two decades ago, along with five other spectators, four of them Americans under 30, in an otherwise empty cinema in Paris. The Yugoslav War attracts more spectators. Rostock was a media festival. A documentary film about skinheads in Halle opens with a sequence in which a teenager in a bomber jacket and combat boots bakes a cake, professionally and affectionately, following a recipe book in front of the camera and for the film crew. He once dreamt of becoming a baker and pastry chef, yet his chances of an apprenticeship lie off in the next century. After baking the cake, he heads in uniform into the prefabricated wasteland Halle-Neustadt and transforms himself, in the collective of the jobless, into a monster. Back in the apartment his mother is in tears, a former teacher with bygone beliefs in the "Socialist Community GDR," now a salary slave for a retail outlet somewhere west of the Elbe with a five-hour drive to get to work and back so that her son "stays off the streets." The film's director is Thomas Heise, a son of probably the sole East German philosopher who doesn't deserve to go under in the current theatre of forgetting. Three years ago I attended a conference in Paris on Brecht and Carl Schmitt based on the example of "The Measures". There, I ran into Günter Maschke who, following his experience and disappointment in Cuba, had shifted from Left to Right. This was hardly a radical move, if anything a doctrinal back somersault into Gottfried Benn's convenient slave-owner wisdom that exploitation is a human phenomenon. We have Maschke to thank for publishing the writings of Donoso Cortés, a Spanish diplomat in Berlin in 1848 who not only was an eye-witness to the failed German attempt by dint of a bourgeois Revolution to keep pace with developments across Europe, which in turn triggered a national compromise between the bourgeoisie and the Junker caste, that is the German military machine, but who also discovered German history's law of motion, namely, delayed causality. Maschke told me nothing would ever come of the East German Revolution, for no corpses had floated down the Elbe, from Dresden to Hamburg. It took me some time to understand why Brecht considered the Peasant Wars as the greatest misfortune in German history. They erupted at an inopportune juncture. They defanged the Reformation in true Protestant style. Even the non-violent East German "Revolution" of 1989, piloted and hampered by the Protestant Church and State Security, was a German disaster. We're now in a quagmire: the unmentionableness of the Stasi debates, an attempt to oppress the colonized by suggesting collective guilt. The storm on retail stores stocking Western goods ended up in kowtow before the wares. From Leipzig, the city of heroes, to the terrors of Rostock. The scars cry out for wounds. The oppressed potential for violence, no revolution or emancipation without violence against the oppressors, vents itself in attacks against those weaker: asylum seekers and poverty-stricken foreigners, the poor against the poorest. Not a finger is laid on a single property shark, regardless of what nation they come from. The reaction to the economic war against the right of abode is war against the homeless. A drive through Mecklenburg: at every petrol station the oil companies' victory banners, in every village McPaper & Co instead of the usual stationery store. In the sea of alienation being German is the last illusion of identity, the last island. But what is that: to be German? A skinhead's answer to the question, why are you proud to be German: "We are the people of poets and thinkers." For example? - Brecht and Einstein. In the German Democratic Republic, young people were regulated and fawned over in equal measure. In the wake of the destruction of an infrastructure that was essentially meant to pacify them, they were released without any transition into the freedom of the market, which spits out the majority of them, because it can only be interested in the present and not in the future. Now, they are left to fend for themselves. The rioters in Rostock and elsewhere are storm-troopers of democracy, which, ever since its invention in the Athens of slavery, has always only really existed as an oligarchy. They are the radical defenders of fortress Europe, precisely because the servants' entrance alone is open to them in the short or long term. It is a platitude that the helpless debates by politicians on asylum law, as Karl Kraus would have said, amount to no more than "cutting a corn off a cancer patient." "The boat is full," or will be so shortly, and on the agenda is the war over life jackets and places in the lifeboats, though nobody knows where they can land, except on cannibalistic shores. When asked to explain this state of affairs to their children, everybody is alone. And perhaps this loneliness is a ray of hope. September 29,1992 May 2014 Me. Rosie is now in the nursing home on Gotlindestraße in Lichtenberg. Two stops from the station, from Siegfriedstrasse via Freyaplatz. The home is newly built and located between a supermarket, allotments, an industrial wasteland, and a terraced housing estate. Rosie thinks she's in Pankow and would be revolted were she to see the area full of little German flags, the drunkards, the bargain kiosks with something or other, mostly in bottles. As in "The City Beyond the River", an intermediate realm in which people become ever more transparent, until one day they're forgotten, vanished into thin air. I'm observing myself how I'm dismantling her flat, how furnishings and a living space turn into junk. Rosie's attempt to accept death as a fact, as already done and dusted, so as to outsmart it, to retain control, is going awry for want of oxygen. This confuses her and she keeps wracking her brain about what else remains to be done. And yet, I think less about her than about Mark, who lies in the clinic, with secondaries in the lungs and the liver, and I know it's hopeless and haven't accepted that he'll die within the year, but assume it will be so. And no matter what, Rosie will die this year, if not in weeks, days. Andreas was admitted to the hospital in Buch today. I heard his fear on the phone. And I don't know what I'm doing, almost blindly, at the Volksbühne theatre. This film whose material interests me, something foreign that I'll take possession of. I ought to shoot the grime at Rosie's flat that now reeks of my cats, the scattered debris, the slips of paper. My mother is chuckling at the prospect of her death while at the same time fascinated by it as an experience. She's eyeballing her fate.
