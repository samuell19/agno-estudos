This match brings to the newsreel screen one of the greatest amateur teams that ever wore football boots. Amateurs, but already they've beaten nearly all the crack professionals. These boys have made the name of the trojans club world famous. In pace and ball control, they have no equals anywhere. Once near the goal, it's next door to a dead certainty. Now, watch another one score from the enemy. Setchley has the ball and he's fetching it along like a mother nursing a baby. Yes, it's a goal. And that brings the total of setchley's goals up to 34 for the season already. This young man is one of the most dazzling sparks in the team that is all highlights. Can't you appreciate talent- - and before the great Chelsea game versus arsenal. - Sit down setchley. - We give you this interview with the team. Nice goal, setch! Will the trojans maintain their wonderful record? Sit down! Or will the big guns of mighty arsenal blow them sky-high? Eddie hapgood left back and arsenal captain. Bryn Jones, he cost arsenal as much as the war and he's almost as dangerous. Leslie Jones, another international. Cliff bastin, the boy wonder, football is the only game he ever wants to play. That's not what my wife would say. The three musketeers, alf fields, crayston and George male. The one and only George Allison, mind you don't lose that tie pin. Kirchen, the streak of lightning on the right wing. Bremner, born with a silver football in his mouth, but he bust it. Ted Drake, center-forward, tall, dark and handsome. Swindon, the goalkeeper, still in his winter woollies. - Get out. - And Tom Whitaker, their famous trainer. Now, for the trojans. Here's Francis kindilett secretary and organiser. You looked really good, frank, you do, absolutely, really good. Orbin, goal. Wilcock, left wing, priebe, left back. Garrow, centre half, brown, left half. Then there's bridge, centre forward, and jerner, inside left. And Charlie, right back, the trojans' brilliant captain. Now, here's a man to watch, morring, this is his last match before he gets married. After that his wife will want him. Setchley has a lady friend, it's Helen, the trojans' mascot. They pin a badge on Helen every time they win, setchley looks after her. He's the only one of the team she can trust. Now, for the trojans' dark horse, Jack doyce, inside right. Doyce has only just joined the team, but he's a well-known amateur and great things are expected of him. You hear that, doyce? He's not here, Mr. Kindilett. What? Well, I hope there's nothing wrong. He'll be there. You may be in the team yet, Mr. Male. Even greater records. How did you like that, Mr. Allison? Oh, very interesting indeed. We're showing that all over the country. Are you really? Oh yes, thank you. Well, frank, it's 12 o'clock now. We meet in the stadium at three. That's right, they'll begin wheeling US off at 10 minutes past, yes? Oh, I hope not, I hope sure not. Programme, programme! A visual programme and teams. Thank you. Programmes! - There you are. Trojan or arsenal fan? Trojan, trojan. That horse on the corner. Wear those colours. What the hell is it you think I'm wearing? Up the arsenal. - Up the trojans. - Arsenal! Trojans! Above all, boys, you must respect this amateur side. They're one of the finest amateur teams we've seen for years. They don't play your game, they play the attacking game. All their five forwards go up at once and their right half and left half, they go through at every possible chance. And when those two wing half backs go through, I want our inside forwards, left and right, go after them, don't let them get away with it. Now that's important. You get that, Eddie? - Yes, we got it. - Yeah. The prestige of the arsenal is at stake. I am more keen to win this match than I am to win 90% of our games during the season. Time for the boys to change, Mr. Allison. Oh, okay, Tom, well, carry on, boys, get on. You'll be in here this afternoon, boys. Who is this doyce? Oh, it'll be a walk home. Oh, good afternoon, Mr. Kindilett. You're not gonna find it too easy, boys, you know. Hello, Tim. Hello, bill. - Frank. - Everyone here, Carter? All except Mr. Morring, sir, and Mr. Doyce. Oh, doyce will be here, he won't miss this game. And Phil morring's with his fiasco. Well, raille, you better get changed any case, never know where you are with a fellow like doyce. Well, there are only 20 minutes to go. Now, really Gwen, you're not upset about that shemozzle at the flat, are you? What do you expect me to be, tickled to death? Well, I can explain about that girl, all right? But it's rather a long story. I'll tell you tonight. Tonight's off. Oh, you're thinking of Phil morring? Perhaps. Met his family yet? No, well they're away travelling. Well, I thought you hadn't. They're nice people but a bit stuffy. They've got a great deal of that, you know, and you won't see a penny of it if he marries you. Love in an attic. Well, well, how touching. I'm marrying Phil, not his family. You're telling me. Dear me, I do believe we're quite annoyed. We'll soon settle that. That's the last time, Jack. Of course, I'll see you tonight. So sorry, Jack, but it's all over. The key will still be on top of the door. I'm so sorry, inga. I know I'm late, but the traffic was awful. Hello, Phil. - Hello. - Programmes. Gwen, I tried to get you last night and this morning. Hello, inga, how's the cousin from Sweden? You think you go home, no? You always make the same joke, Phil. But Gwen, why didn't you tell me you couldn't see me last night? I couldn't, it was too sudden. My aunt Betsy was taken ill. Darling, I'm so glad to see you. Have you missed me? - Have I? Come on, Gwen, we'll never get to our seats. Lord, I must fly, I'll see you after the game, Gwen. Goodbye inga. - Yes, darling. Better take doyce's shirt, George. That's a good girl, isn't she lovely? Break away setchley, you won't be fit for the match. Doyce, about bloody time! Look here doyce, you're a part of this team, you know I expected you here hours ago. Sorry I was in conference. Anyway, I see Phil morring isn't here yet. I guess everybody is here we may be able to play some football. You shouldn't wonder. Sorry raille. Heavens Eddie, what's this? I haven't got a shirt. Shut up! No shirts anywhere? - No! - Yeah. - Just a minute, bunch! - Hello, what's the matter now? Where are these boys' shirts? There's none of them here. I left every player's shirt on his own hook. There he is, he's got them. Take them, he's got them all on. It's gonna be cold out there with nothing to do in goal. - Crikey. - Don't tell me the jolly old rolls let you down. Yes old boy, I had to abandon it. Woo, tut-tut. Now come along Mr. Doyce, you're next on the table. So, she won't let you alone, hey Phil? Why don't you mind your own business. Why don't you grow up? Now get a move on boys only ten minutes to go. Good afternoon everybody, this is George Alison calling from the arsenal stadium, London. The great day has arrived at last. We're about to see this long anticipated charity match between the trojans, the famous amateur team, and the arsenal. We have been fortunate securing the services of a very famous commentator, I'm perfectly certain you will all recognise the well-known voice of Mr. E.V.H Emmett who is appearing today by kind permission of the gaumont British news. Now Mr. Emmett it's up to you to give US all the thrill of the match. Well, I certainly will do my best and I'm sure it will be a thrilling match. I certainly hope so, because there's a record crowd here, an enormous crowd, the stadium's absolutely packed. Out. What are you pressing George? I'm on the news trying to get the right number the right side on. Come on lads, on your toes. Hey, hey, come on, break a leg. And the teams are coming out now, arsenal coming out first led by their captain Eddie hapgood. And now the trojans lead by Charlie. You're gonna like the look of that fellow, doyce, can do. - Yes, Tom, I do. I'm keen to see how he gets on this afternoon. The band has blown itself out and the referee's just bringing out the ball, so it won't be long now. The two captains are trotting up to the centre to shake hands with everybody in sight and toss for choice of ends. Eddie hapgood has the coin, Charlie calls to it, but yes trojans are defending the clock end of the field. Arsenal kick off break to Ben Jones and out to bastin on the left wing. Now back to Bryn Jones, torbin punches away. Drake has it on the right and he's going to shoot! But torbin saves it nicely again and clears. Doyce heads it, that boy certainly looks good. Now the trojans are getting the ball away into the arsenal's half. Wilcock has it, passes to brown, hapgood tackles him. Brown still has it and he shoots. But swindon clears. Terrific excitement as the game swings away from the arsenal goal. Play in the trojans half, the ball goes back. Arsenal left back has it, he bangs it up. Up it goes and jerner and bremner jump for it. Oi, oi, cut the grass, the ref can't see. The game is on again, up in the centre of the field and now it's arsenal's turn to attack. The ball goes up to kirchen, he's racing on. He shoots and a grand save! Corner against trojans. Oi, ref, oi, don't keep blowing that whistle, blow your nose now and again. Yeah! Kirchner takes it, nicely in, but the amateur boys are on to it like lightning. Now Bryn Jones has it, no mucking about. The pass to bastin. And the boy's away. The centre, shoot! No, another grand saved by torbin. This is a terrific game. Amateur, professional, they're all playing like heroes. Now male is on to it and he passes up, but garrow has it. Doyce takes it away, keep an eye one doyce, he shoots and swindon tips it over, giving a corner against arsenal. How do you like that Mr. Allison? Ah, it's not a goal yet. Don't hold the ball so much doyce, you're not all that good. I don't need your advice. Setchley takes the kick and arsenal defence have got it away. Now morring has it. Look out there, hey, doyce and morring in collision. Morring's hurt by the look of it. Oh, he bang his head. And the referee drops the ball and the game is on again. Arsenal have it, that's Drake coming down now like a hurricane, shoot and torbin saves again. Nearing the end of the first half now and there's no score yet. Here's arsenal pressing again, Drake has it out on the left to Bryn Jones, Bryn runs in. It's dangerous, now back to Drake. Drake's onto it, over to kirchen. This time it's a goal! First blood to the arsenal, 1-0, and about 30 seconds to go for halftime. Yes, this game is living up to all its promise of thrill. A real dog fight, backwards and forwards. And when you consider the arsenal's reputation among the professional teams you certainly must hand it to these trojans, they're putting up a wonderful show. The score at halftime is arsenal, one, trojans, nil. And that's just how we like it. Well done, boys. Well done chap! - Well done, al. - Well done! - Loose on the play field. - Well nevermind lads, it's only the first half. He won't beat you like that again. Sorry about that Phil. Stay in position next half, Jack. Who wants more tea? Who is that for? For Mr. Doyce of the trojans, it's marked urgent. How we going, serg? We're one up, son. Yippee! Listen boys, look here, all you've got to do is to quicken up in this second half, you got absolutely beat. I know you're all a bit nervous, there's nothing in the world to worry about, see? Oh I say, doyce, try and remember you're part of a team, don't be so selfish with the ball. For heaven's sake, will you let me play my own game? No, no, don't do that, we don't want to lose the match. Now then, let's have a look at this. Is he gonna need a stitch, Jimmy? No, no it's just a graze. I'll do this, you go and look after the lads. Right. Telegrams for you, gentlemen. Congratulations from your girlfriends, to Charlie, setchley, garrow, torbin, Helen, who's Helen? Women are not allowed here you know. Ah, but that's Helen of Troy the face that sank a thousand ships, say thank you Helen. I thank you. I always thought Helen was a horse. Oh, there's a parcel for Mr. Doyce. For you mister doyce, from one of your admirers I suppose. To setchley. - Thank you. Come along now boys, on your toes, only one down, you'll get 'em this half. Where's kindilett? Went out the other way I think. Come on gents, get a move on. Come along Mr. Morring, for heaven's sake get a move on. Teams are coming out now for the second half. All depends on the first 15 minutes, Jimmy, whether our boys can hold 'em. Ah, they'll do it all right, Mr. Kindilett. Trojans kick off this time, bridge kicks off to doyce and doyce snaps it out to the left wing. Setchley has it and he's racing ahead in the best bastin style. It's a goal, it must be, no swindon dives, he's got another pick, he's up and he's cleared beautifully. Bravo, swindon, bravo, couldn't have done it better myself. Trojans again attacking, they're going all out to wipe out their rub goal. Sensation, here's an appeal for hands in the penalty area. Yes, the referee's allowing it, this is serious. You're telling me. First blind man I've seen without a dog, what a ref! Doyce is taking the kick, is this the equaliser? Yes, he scored, like a bullet in the top corner. With a crashing drive, doyce scored from the penalty and it's arsenal one, trojans one. Oh, what a basket. What's that you said? I said, what a blaster sir, didn't I? I've had my eye on you all the match. That's right, thought they'd be on the game. Just waiting now for whistle to kickoff after that goal. There it goes, Drake to Bryn Jones and over to bremner, arsenal are pressing now, they're racing forward to the trojans' goal. Bastin has it and he shoots and torbin saves, he's playing a wonderful game that trojan goal. Look, look, what's the matter with doyce? By jobe he does look bad. Doyce has just collapsed like a log, it must be some sort of a faint or something. I didn't see him get hit. Oh, he certainly looks bad. This is a most unlucky accident for the trojans. Those amateur boys have been playing really magnificent football. Now to lose their crack inside right at a critical time like this, it's appalling luck. Doyce looked pretty bad, too, but nobody seems to know what's the matter with him. Inga, he's dead. Doyce is being carried off now by the ambulance men and the whistle goes to resume the game. What's up Tom? Can't tell doctor. I don't like the look of him at all. Trojans are playing wonderfully plucky football, don't forget they're a man short from now on. Crowd shouts, "come on the ten men", they've got a sporting task that I don't see how they can possibly hold arsenal down. From the first kickoff, it's been a game of sensation. The strange collision of two trojans. Arsenal's crashing goal. Games abandoned! Equalising penalty, topped off in the dramatic collapse of the new trojan player halfway through the second half. Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have to announce to you a piece of bad news. Jack doyce is very seriously injured. It has been decided to abandon the match. But both sides are naturally anxious for a decision, so there'll be a replay next Wednesday afternoon at three o'clock. Just a minute boys, please. How did it happen? It's a bad business, you can change, but you'll have to stay in your dressing rooms. Frank, I've got to get away for a minute, I'll be back. I'm sorry Philip, it's out of my hands now. All right, boys, getting about. Listen boys, you can change now, but you got to remain behind a bit, boss's orders. Come on now, let's get going. I can't tell you anything gentlemen, you've got to wait and see mister Allison. Well, where is he? I don't know, if I knew, I could tell you. I don't know anything about it, I can't tell you. Wait for a minute, wait for a minute. Please, what's happened to Mr. Doyce? I'm sorry young lady, I'm afraid he's dead. Sorry boys, you'll get the story later. Who was that girl, did she give her name? No sir, her face seemed familiar though. That's what I thought. All right George, what's the bid idea? Get me Scotland yard please, whitehall. One, two, one, two. One, two, one, two. And, stop, stop! Ladies, ladies. These skirts weren't provided for you by nature. They're meant to enhance your beauty, to allure. You must swish em' about a bit and make em' look attractive, do you follow me? Yes sir. We've only got till Wednesday, ladies. The fair name of the metropolitan police beauty chorus is at stake. Now you've got to make it alluring. Follow me. Inspector Slade here? Over there. Yes Clinton, what is it? I thought you were at the yard. Yes? A case, inspector. A case, but man I've only got four days to get this show on, I can't take a case now. The assistant commissioner thinks it might be a murder. Oh. You know, you oughtn't to be doing all this sir. These men will never be the same again. Oh, that's something to be thankful for. Where's the body? Down at the arsenal stadium, one of the players. The arsenal? Let me see, this will do it. You haven't seen this one before, have you? Not bad for 10 Bob. Guaranteed to put any suspect at his ease at first sight. You and your hats, sir. Well, it's very suitable, all these outdoor fellows with shorts on. What's his name? An amateur, John doyce. Glory be. Well, I'm glad it's in the hands of the police anyway. This would happen on a Saturday. Who was near him when he fell? Nobody, actually. The ball came from a clearance from the trojan goal. Fell in front of doyce, the inside right, who faltered. Morring the right half, seeing that, ran forward, picked up the ball, followed by Bryn Jones, our inside left. They carried the ball on, the same time, Leslie Jones moving forward here, seeing doyce faltering and stumbling, he stopped dead. But nobody was actually near doyce when he fell. No, not within five yards of him. Nobody could've touched him inspector, it must have been his heart, I've seen it happen before. Yes, I dare say you're right, Mr. Kindilett. Well, I'll go to see the teams at once. Leslie, this is inspector Slade. - Pleasure. - How do you do? You'd be the nearest man to doyce when he fell, wouldn't you? Yes, I was Tom. Can you tell US what happened? When he had the ball I rushed forward to tackle him. Just as I got there, he tumbled and fell to the ground. What did he look like? He was sweating badly and looked very grey. Grey? - Yes, he looked terrible. - Terrible. Very hot in here, isn't it? It is rather. Thank you so much. What's all the mystery about? Why are we being kept here? Looks as if you'll be in the replay, George. So what? Nothing, what's biting you? The devil you're driving at. Oh shut up George, you're getting nervy. Well, who wouldn't be? He's dead, isn't he? After all, there must be somebody here who knows- - I'm sorry to keep you waiting gentlemen. I've just one or two routine questions I'd like to ask. Now, did any of you see doyce eat or drink anything at halftime? Well, he took a slice of lemon, but then so did most of the other boys. Yes, of course. What about the parcel? Yes that's right, he got a parcel at halftime. A parcel? Did anybody see what was in it? It was only a small thing, sir, the commissioner brought it in and I gave it to Mr. Doyce myself. Yeah, where are his clothes? Over here sir. Clinton, get that commissioner over. Right sir. It was only a small thing, sir. Light too and he sat down here and started to unpack it. Hmm, there's nothing in here. Almost twins, aren't we? Who was next to him? I was, is that what you're looking for? Well, that's the wrapping of the parcel! Oi, oi, oi, don't touch. Here's the man sir. Who delivered this? District messenger sir. Check on that, will you Clinton? Yes, sir. There's something- about that girl, sir. - What? - There was a girl- - she called here after the message sir, asking for doyce. That's right, she spoke to me. I told her doyce was dead. She say anything? No sir, she pretty nearly fainted, sir. I see, thank you sergeant. Thank you sir. There's one other thing. Did anyone try to get into these rooms from halftime onwards until the team returned? No sir, I'd have seen anybody who did sir. That's all I want to know. Oh Clinton. - Yes sir? Check all this litter, will you, and see if you can find anything. Very good sir, but what am I supposed to look for? I haven't the faintest idea, yet. Pardon me Mr. Allison. Clever, isn't it? Thank you Mr. Allison. Found something? How long you gonna keep US here inspector? Well, not very long. Oh Clinton! - Yes sir? We're looking for a small sharp pointed object. And if you find it, be very careful. Very good, sir. Be hanged if I can understand it. Sound as a bell one moment and his heart stops the next. Have you looked at his left thumb? I missed that. Don't take it to heart, you were meant to. Poison, alkaloid reaction. What now? Well, first find out what was in that parcel and who that girl was. Ey? Just a moment meadows, bring your things. Come along. Alright sergeant, you can stop playing sand castles. Here, doctor. Oh there you are. Oh, hello Mr. Kindilett, where have you been? Well, I needn't keep you any longer gentlemen. Dr. Meadows rather thinks the death was caused by an obscure form of tetanus. Contracted through a scratch on the thumb. Isn't that so doctor? Oh yes quite so, yes, yes. But we must find the object on which doyce injured himself. Owing to the risk of infection. Therefore in your own interests, Dr. Meadows thinks we ought to have a search. Hey, Dr. Meadows? Yes, absolutely essential. Very tactful of you inspector. Why not say doyce was murdered and have done with it? Keep your head raille, what the the inspector suggests is only common sense. Thank you very much. Of course if you object to being searched- - not me, go right ahead. Yes, let's get it over. Good, well I'll send a couple of men to help sergeant Clinton. Oh, would you mind staying with the team? Mr. Allison. Now look Allison, raille was right. So doyce was murdered? Yes, that search as a blind kitten, won't find a thing. Whoever killed doyce got rid of whatever it was ages ago, it's lying about the stadium somewhere. Waiting till the murderer sees his chance to get it back. Oh good heavens, I suppose you want half the yard down here now looking for clues? Not on your life, I wait for the clues to come to me. Now listen George, do you mind me calling you George? Not at all, no. Now, about this girl, what did she look like? Oh she was tall, fair, very pretty. And you know both the commissioner and myself were convinced we've seen her somewhere before. What was she wearing? Long white coat with blue trimmings, a funny sort of hat with a feather in it. Well, like you have there. I thought this was a model. I'm back to report sir. I know, not a thing. No sir. Well, bear up. Look I want to see these men again, but informally at their own convenience, can you arrange that? Well, we've fixed a game of golf for him at the dyke tomorrow, would that do? Fine, I'll be there. Clinton, the carriage waits, adios. Bye. And I say to myself, young lady you're up to something. Now what time was this? It was about five o'clock, she thought I didn't see her ha-ha, but see her I did. Yes, and I saw her last night too. She was here last night? With him, very late it was. They came here in a taxi and left together again today in one about two o'clock and it's my opinion, she was here all night. You're telling me, you haven't see her here before? No sir, but I have it in me mind that I've seen her face somewhere often, but I can't think where. What was she wearing? She had a long white coat on with blue ornamentations. I think someone's been here before US, sir. Mind you, I believe you've hit on something Clinton. Looks as if this fellow was in the advertising business sir. Yeah, what they call a layout man. What's that? Sounds like a piano sir. Next flat sir, that's the composer. Yeah, that's what he thinks. Mr. Doyce is definitely fond of the ladies. He was no end of a nuisance sir. The neighbours were always complaining about him. Would you recognise the girl in the white coat when you see it? I don't know sir, she was far better looking than any of them. Here's his diary sir. Now then she did miss something. Perhaps padriski can help US. Will you stop that row? Live and let live, doyce! How about that stinking row you kicked up this morning if you don't shut up I'll come in and wring your neck! Oh, you will, will you? Well, how do you do? I beg your pardon I thought it was young doyce, who are you? I'm inspector Slade of the criminal investigation department. Can you tell me who the man was that doyce had the row with? Well, as a matter of fact I didn't catch a word but I think it was something about some girl. And when was it? In the middle of my prestissimo. And what time was it? Oh just before lunch, about one. Oh, thank you so much. And by the way will you tell young doyce from me that if there's any more of these infernal rows- - I'll tell him when I see him. Did you see anyone come here at about one o'clock? I thought not. Where's the phone? On the writing desk, sir. What are you gonna do now sir? Get the yard to find that girl with the white coat. Where's the w? If she was here at the time, she must have heard something. Hello, Scotland yard, inspector Slade speaking. Get me the information bureau, sergeant Smithers. Oh, it's old prestissimo again. Oh, Smithers, I want this information to go to the evening papers at once. What are you doing, Gwen? What you're looking at me like that for? Where did you go when you left me at he stadium this afternoon? For heaven's sake I had something to do, I just remembered at the stadium. What does it matter? Inga, you're not to say anything, do you understand? Why do the police want you? Is it because? Why did you say today that Jack doyce was dead? But I didn't, you're crazy, I couldn't have said it. Gwen, you must tell me, what happened today? I can't, oh I've been a fool. There's something else too I can't tell you, but inga you must stick by me, do you understand? And don't ask me any questions. If it's Phil, I can't see him, I can't see him like this. Inga, make him go away, make it all right with him. Hello inga, is Gwen in? Yes Phil, but she's not well. She's so upset. About doyce? Of course we're all upset about Jack. She's not feeling very well and I shouldn't bother her tonight if I were you. Oh, you think I go home, ey? Yes, I think you do. Okay, well I'll be playing golf in the morning with the boys, I'll pop round when I get back. That's right, I'll tell Gwen. Enjoy yourself. Bye inga. Bye. Now where's doyce's diary? I must put my thinking cap on. Oh, just the thing. A headgear peculiarly conducive to thought, hey Clinton? Let's have a look. Very interesting, you know sergeant Smithers is getting a bit broad on the hips. That's the second time he's split that. Very interesting and illuminating. There's an entry here for February the 24th, a £120. Somebody called, s. Now give me a girl's name beginning with s. Sylvia, Sybil, psyche? Psyche, that's psyche you fool, begins with a p. Here's another, march the 19th, £75, s, cash, now why cash? Blackmail, sir. Maybe. Hello? All right, underneath here, go on. Inspector Slade's office. Home office pathologist speaking sir. Hello, Slade speaking. Yes, yes, well keep right on with it. Right, thank you, goodbye. It was poison, they don't know what yet. One of the digitalian groups. Setchley's a chemist, sir. Hello, yes, yes, Slade speaking. What, they did?! You didn't know? All right keep a close watch and don't touch a thing. All right, goodbye. That's the stadium speaking, somebody tried to break into the treatment room, was disturbed and got away. The treatment room sir? Yes, Clinton, you ass, don't you see, now we know it's murder. I've left everything as it was, sir. Excellent. What are we looking for, sir? Hanged if I know, but we've got to find it. The only thing is, mind you don't prick yourself on anything and replace everything exactly where you find it. We've got to finish this job in three days. Why? Because of the replay? No, because of the concert. You know, Clinton, it's heartbreaking to be a producer. All my life I've longed for the glamour of the footlights, the applause of the audience. Yes sir, and here we are just a couple of plain policemen and we don't even know what we're looking for sir. Clinton. Sterilised horsehair, oh this is too easy. Look. The killer. You know you've got to hand it to our murderer, he's no fool, but he didn't expect the treatment room to be sealed. And that's where we're going to get him. Come along. Replace those things exactly and not a word to a soul that I've been in there. Very good, sir. Oh Clinton, did I say three days? Yes sir. We'll make it in two. Now let's go and see how those boys play golf. There you are Ted, pick the bones out of that. Don't look so dashed pleased with yourself. Listen, you fellas are too darn gloomy. Now what I think about doyce is- go and sit down. Back to the bazaar, you. Horrible weather, isn't it? Hello Slade, good of you to come, have a drink. Oh, thank you so much I'll have a whiskey and soda if you don't mind. Morning Slade, just waiting for the rain to stop as usual, have a drink, sergeant. Well- - it's all right sergeant, we're off duty. Thank you sir, I'll have the same. Good morning inspector, have you decided who to arrest yet? That's all I've been waiting for. What do you mean you've been waiting for? Don't you touch me, hey hey! I wonder where Tom is, excuse me Slade. Of course, yes. And all unconscious of their doom the little victims play, hey Slade? Yeah, but of course that was equally true of doyce you know kindilett. Yes I know, this is a rotten business Slade. I know my men and I like them. I've built this team up from absolutely nothing. If one of them turns out to be a murderer, it smashes up everything we've worked for. Yes, I understand. Tell me, was anybody hurt at the game on Saturday? Hmm, yes, morring was. Doyce got out of position and barged him and morring grazed his head. And I suppose he had it dressed in the treatment room? Yes, he did, as a matter of fact. Excuse me. Oh good shot, all alone? Sometimes I prefer my own company. I had a chat with most of the others, so I thought perhaps i'd- - have a go at me? Fire away inspector, but I'm afraid I can't help you very much. Oh well, one never knows, one never knows. You knew doyce pretty well, didn't you? No more than the others. He didn't exactly hate the fairer sex, did he? I don't know anything about doyce's women. Well, interesting that you use the plural. It was a girl called Stella or Sheila or something, she was at the stadium last Saturday. I fancy she and doyce were pretty friendly, weren't they? I tell you Slade, doyce's love life is a blank okay, okay it's just an idea. Do you mind if I have a pot at that? He's all wet! He always was! Is this some dicky bird? Now what's happened, boys? He's got a bit wet! Shall I put him in the tabloids sir? You look a different girl, now. Very funny, very funny, where are my trousers? They're drying, you don't want to catch a cold, do you? Where are my trousers? Setchley, setchley, don't move, one moment. The girl, I, inspector please, the girl with the white coat. So that's the girl that went to doyce's flat? No wonder everybody recognised her, she's an advertisement model. Clinton, check up on her. Right sir. Great Scott, that's Phil morring's girl. Morring! So that's why doyce wasn't at the pictures on Saturday, she was with him at his flat. Shut up setchley! Brighton police traced her as easy as falling off a log sir. Her name's Gwen Lee, 6 wilfred mews Baker Street. All right, hop in. Right sir. What time did Phil say he'd be here? Well he didn't tell, he said he try and come back quick. You tell him, Gwen, yes? Do you think I'm a fool? If the police want me they'll have to find me. Maybe they do and then what do you tell Phil? Phil loves me, he'll believe me. Anyway I can handle Phil, I always have done. I'll go. Hello Phil. No, it's not Phil, it's inspector Slade. Anthony Slade, criminal investigation department and this is sergeant Clinton, may we come in? Yes. What do you want? Oh just a word, would you mind closing that door, it's rather chilly after rain. Oh what a delightful room. Oh, madam butterflies, delicious. Oh I beg your pardon I. Would you mind introducing? I heard your name. I'm inga Larson, please, what do you want? I should love a cup of tea. I made you coffee. If you could find a piece of cake perhaps. Well, you've come about Jack doyce I suppose? No, not at all, we don't want to dwell on that. We've all been indiscreet in our time now. Won't you sit down? You see, the trouble with little lapses like these is that they make other people jealous. Now what we have to do in a case like this is to find out the motive for the murder, someone to whom doyce did an injustice. That covers a lot of people. Yes, pardon my saying so miss Lee, I think he treated you very badly. You're not suggesting that I had- - no, no, not for a moment. By jove, what a lovely ring. Oh of course I was forgetting you and morring are engaged, aren't you? Yes. Yes, a charming fellow. Very well-to-do I believe? Tell me, was he very jealous? Gwen. Ah, no, no coffee. Do not listen to him, he is trying to trap you. No, no, no young lady. Don't tell him anything, he can't make you. What's the matter with you, I can look after myself. But Gwen, it isn't you, it's Philip! The kettle is boiling, would you mind? Ah Clinton, help her will you? Very good, sir. You were at doyce's flat on Friday night, you know who came to see him on Saturday morning. Somebody who had a quarrel with doyce, was it morring? I tell you I don't know anything. Now, it's no good trying to shield a murderer, that won't help at all. It's much safer to come out with the truth. Who should I be shielding? Well, that's what I'm here to find out. Well then, was it morring? Now you look here miss. Now listen young lady. Gwen is not shielding anyone, I tell you the truth. Inga! It's because she lose her job if people know she is with doyce. Yes it's very clever, but I still want that cup of coffee, Clinton. Yes sir. See that she makes it this time. She won't make it for me, sir. I make it. Is that true? Yes. But my dear miss Lee, why on earth didn't you tell me? We're quite human you know. The trouble is that people don't trust the police. I've known of dozens of cases where the. Don't tell me the coffee. What, only two cups? Oh no, but I insist. We don't want any, thank you. Oh, well, Clinton will you join me? I'd love it sir. Oh and a real Swedish cake, how delicious. I oughtn't, but I really must. Oh hello, morring old chap! Do come in, just in time. Excuse me. Go on, I'm afraid I've beaten you to it. Most amazing thing, look who's here. We were just talking about you. Just having some coffee, won't you join US? No, well do sit down everybody. Morring, I can see that you're at a loss, you're wondering why I'm here. Well, we've had a most interesting little chat. You know women are the most extraordinarily difficult people to understand, uncertain, coy and hard to please. Sugar, sir? One, please. What are you doing here? Oh purely social, as a matter fact, I wanted to invite these charming ladies to the concert on Wednesday the metropolitan police follies. I'm the producer, could I interest you in a ticket? No, you couldn't. Oh no of course, you may be detained elsewhere. Well. Skol. So, the Swedes make coffee with epsom salts. Well, under the circumstances we better be running along. No, no, please don't get up anybody. I expect you two want to have a chat together. I'll be seeing you quite soon, come along, Clinton. Well, I know where I am now. You and doyce must've thought I was a fool. Phil, let me explain. I had hoped that you'd come to your senses. I know I've been a fool, but these things just happen and all the time they don't mean anything. We love each other Phil, can't we forget it ever happened? It's a bit late for that now, isn't it? Late? Doyce is dead. But I don't understand you. Oh, you wouldn't. Phil, you've got to listen to me. We used to be so happy together, we could be again. I'm sorry Gwen, I'm through. But darling I promise you everything's all right, please Phil listen to me! What's happened? Gwen, come, sit down. You, that's what you wanted, wasn't it? You're in love with him. You turned him against me. Gwen, you're mad. I've never seen you like this. He thinks he's finished with me, doesn't he? Well, I haven't finished with him. I'd put Phil in such a tough spot if I wanted to. They think he did it, don't they? Well supposing he did, supposing they're not so far wrong. What do you mean? Gwen. He hated Jack, he was so jealous of him. He'd have the most awful rows with him. They don't know about that, do they? Well, supposing I tell them. He didn't, you couldn't. Couldn't 1? Phil, Phil! He's not here I'm afraid. But if you have a message for him I'm sure to be seeing him. No, thank you. Only too glad, you know. Clinton, things are beginning to hum. Pardon my saying so sir, but do you think we should let him get away? Yes, neither of them are ready to talk yet, when they are, we'll be waiting for them. I see. You don't, but you will. Yes sir, what do we do now sir? First a call to the yard. I want morring trailed, I want to know absolutely everything he does. Clinton, we're like cabinet ministers in a crisis. We're going barking up another gumtree. Sorry, miss. You've been the deuce of a time, Clinton. Well, I had to get in quietly sir. I see, all right. Oh, I like this. I was always fond of stinks, I hope you didn't do this, Clinton. Don't think so, sir. You suppose it's quite all right sir, breaking in here without a warrant sir? Oh yes, it's a heaven-sent chance, we can have a good look around in peace and quiet. You know, everybody has two sides to their nature. For instance, who'd have thought- who would have thought that a clown like- who would have thought that- don't take any notice of me, sir. Thank you very much. What I was gonna say was, who'd have thought that a clown like setchley could have a place like this? However, that's the policeman's life, isn't it? Seeing what a fella looks like on the other side. Sometimes it's not a very pleasant sight. No sir. What's the matter? A. A frog, why a frog? Come on, let's get it. Don't smack anything on him. - Splatter! - And don't get your big hands on it you damn fool. I'm stalking- - come out, slowly does it. Gently. Got him! Visitors, better open the door then Clinton. Here Freddie go in there and stay put. Oh, it's you mister raille. Raille. Hello inspector, what are you doing down here? Well, I might ask you the same thing raille. Well, 1 think old setchley was a bit upset about that ragging today, I just came down to tell him there was no ill feeling. What's that? Oh, that's just Freddie and nobody you would know. You come here often? It's off and on, we've know each other a long time. Isn't this a bit against regulations inspector? Only slightly. I wanted to have a talk with you raille, I'm glad at this opportunity. I was wondering when you'd get round to it. You know I hated doyce, don't you? I did imagine something of the sort. Don't know if you thought I resented his taking my place in the team. Well I did. But doyce was a better player than I and we wanted to win and I'll tell you something else inspector, doyce deserved to die he was rotten through and through. Whoever did it did an executioner's job. Why? You didn't know doyce, he only wanted what other people already had. Gwen Lee for instance. You knew that she and doyce- - no she didn't say a word, I made a guess. Morring's a good sort inspector. I watched doyce play his filthy game. He only did it to show his power over women. It gave him some sort of distorted pleasure to take Gwen away from Phil, he ruined two lives. He deserved to die, but I don't think you will ever find out who did it. Oh why? You're up against team loyalty. Loyal business, something you don't often meet. You knew setchley well and you were a friend of morring. And you know we used to play together, it was a team called Saxon rovers. And doyce played in it too. Yes. Quiet. Is that Freddie again? Yes. Setchley. Hello setchley. What the? I hope you don't mind we just dropped in, at least Clinton did. Well, what do you want? Oh nothing much, we just want to see the sort of place you worked in, microchemistry, isn't it? Yes, I do analysis for various firms. Quite a paying job I believe. Not bad, I get along. With the money doyce gave you? Who told you that? Freddie did, he told me you were carrying out research in alkaloids. There's money in that, isn't there? Where is it, setchley? I don't know what you're talking about. No, you have to know a bit of everything in my job. This thing measures the heartbeats of frogs, doesn't it? You don't need vivisection for microchemistry, you've got doyce to back you. Maybe you persuaded kindilett to put him in the team for the big match. You knew doyce wanted that, you told him there was a fortune in this research, he gave you money. Clinton, you got the figures? Yes sir. February 24th, s, a £120, April 19th, s, 70- - never mind the rest, the grand total's £875. Perhaps doyce was getting worried about his money, wondering how long it'd be before he'd see a return. He had nothing to worry about. Dick, don't be a- - well, I knew I could do it. And you did, you produced a new drug that nobody's heard of yet, it's baffled the police analysts. Well setchley, where is it? It's gone, I'd made a sample, digitalian 6, it's deadly stuff. You're telling me. Don't be a fool dick, can't you see what he's trying to do? Anyone might've taken it inspector, most of the trojan team have been down here at one time or another. Team loyalty, hey raille? Now listen setchley, you owed doyce money. You were onto something worth a fortune that doyce would've shared. Doyce was killed by a new and deadly poison, your digitalian six is missing from your laboratory. Well, you're an intelligent fellow, there's no need for me to tell you the spot you're in. Your only way out is to find it setchley and find it quick. I told you it would be setchley sir. Setchley, me foot. Has anybody reported morring's movements yet? There he is, there he is! Mr. Philip, Mr. Philip, come on down, your young lady's here to see ya. Who, Gwen? Good all, what are you doing here? Here. Oh budge, be an angel and clear out for a moment? I'll go along with ya. Is it about Gwen? Yes, but- - oh can't we forget about her inga? Oh please Phil. When you went she was saying such horrible things, Phil I was frightened. What did she say? She said that you had quarrels with Jack doyce and if the police knew. Go on. If they knew, then they'll think you killed doyce. Do you believe that, inga? No Phil, no. Please Phil, don't you see you're in danger? Yes you are, he's a very clever man that inspector Slade. He's making trouble, so Gwen should tell him everything. He'll think you did it. But inga, what can I do? Please come and talk with her. It's crazy to think that I killed Jack, it's fantastic. What's the matter? Oh nothing. I go. You're not going back there? Well, I have nowhere else to go. Wait a minute. Budge, oh budge? Yes dear? Budge, can miss Larson spend the night here? She's got nowhere else to go. Oh never mind darling, come on, you can sleep in me own room. Oh good old budge. I shan't be long, i'm gonna put away the car. Inspector Slade's office, it's Thompson sir, he was trailing morring. What, morring slipped his trail sir. Here, give me that. You clumsy blithering idiot, I suppose you were making out your expense list. Well, how long's he been lost? Well find him! Morring's been lost for now. We've gotta find him. We've gotta bring in Gwen Lee, come on. What the devil do you think you doing, waking all the place up. Police. No answer sir. All right break it in. No one here, sir. No. Digitalian six, sir. There's no need to look any further Clinton, we've come full circle. Oh god, it's suicide sir. Not on your life. Doyce, doyce. She must have been in a hurry when she took these, mostly bills, what's this? The body was found lying floating in the east fosse. That's all there is. Is inspector Slade here? Yes, he's inside. Sounds like Thompson, sir. Nice work Thompson. Never mind the alibi, I'll put you in the chorus on Wednesday. He's back now sir. I bet he is. He returned to his house ten minutes ago that Swedish girl's staying there too. Shall I have him brought in? No, we leave him till tomorrow. Very good sir. Well Clinton, at least we know why Gwen Lee was murdered, because she knew who really killed doyce. She heard him quarrel with doyce on Saturday morning and the murderer knew that for the first time at the golf club. Then it was morring sir. Morring must have quarrelled with Gwen Lee after we left here this morning and tonight the Larson girl went to warn morring that Gwen Lee was threatening to talk. It's a desperate job Clinton, two murders in two days. Morning Mr. Whitaker. Morning sergeant. Where's young morring? In the shooting box. Where's that? Over there. Thanks. Mr. Morring. In here Mr. Morring. Phil, they make me come here, they think- - one moment. What the devil have you been doing Slade? That's what I'm asking you morring. What did you do when you left your house at midnight last night? What would you do with a policeman following you? Well, give him the slip. That's what I did. Yes, but in this case it's rather unfortunate. What did miss Larson tell you when she came to see you last night? I tell you it was nothing. What you getting at Slade? She came to warn you, she told you that Gwen Lee was threatening to tell the police that you killed John doyce. No, no, it's not true. That's a damn lie. You went out, broke loose from the man who was following you. Slade, what happened last night? Gwen Lee was found murdered. Gwen, dead? I didn't kill her Slade. I'd like to believe that morring, I told you it is unfortunate. You had a grievance against doyce, he was killed, you quarrelled with your fiance and she didn't last long either and you can't account for any of your actions, looks bad, doesn't it Clinton? Highly incriminating sir. Phil did not do it, please he did not, it was all my fault, I was frightened and I went to him and, oh Phil. Clinton, better take miss Larson to a taxi. Very good, sir. Well, what are you gonna do, arrest me? I could, but I won't, no i'm gonna let you play tomorrow. Fine and I'll start picking out my next victim. No, I risk that, I know exactly how you feel. I got a show of my own coming off tomorrow, I should hate to miss it. What, great Scott, you're almost a human being inspector. Thank you, you ever seen that before? It looks like one of our team notices, kindilett sends them out. Yes, that's his typewriter, the r jumps. You played for the Saxon rovers at wyechester, didn't you? Yes, what's that got to do with it? I thought perhaps you knew. Look here inspector, is this true about Gwen Lee? It's terrible. Morring, you better go have a rubdown. Yes, off you go Philip, practise is over now. We don't want to have you catching cold. Don't worry inspector, I shan't let you down, come on frank. I've sent her home sir. Oh thanks, we know there were four men at wyechester, one was murdered and then there were three. I wonder if there was a fifth. Clinton quick, where's that match programme from last Saturday? There it is sir. It's been under our noses all this time while we've been barking up gumtrees, here we are. Mr. Francis kindilett, the secretary of the trojans was a. Kindilett also founded the well-known Saxon rovers at wyechester in 1930, did you get it sergeant? No sir. The fifth man, that fella was right, what's his name raille, he said we were up against team loyalty. Clinton, do you remember anything about Roman history? What sir? The romans colonised england, they built camps, castra, Chester, wyechester. They surrounded 'em with moats, fosses. That cutting, sir. The east fosse, now doyce received this the Thursday before the match, I bet every hat in my wardrobe it was sent as a warning. Get on to the wyechester police, find out if that cutting is from a local paper, get the details. We're getting nearer the motive. Hello. Revenge. Hello, wyechester police speaking, right. Body was found lying floating in the east fosse. About seven o'clock in the morning, I saw her in the east fosse on my way to work, directly I had a look, I knew it was Mary kindilett. I couldn't have made any mistake sir, because I passed quite close to the body and I've often seen the young lady about- - death was due to drowning, the dead girl had been in the fosse for several hours. Yes, I tried to cheer her up, that's why I took her to the dance, but she seemed very depressed and about halfway through I found that she'd left, later I heard that her body had been found. I found the ring on her dressing table, there was a chain attached to it and I guess that she wore it round her neck. Her mother just died and Mary knew that if she got married I should be left alone. I think she wanted to keep it secret for the time being. There are many unsatisfactory features in this case, why has the fiancee not come forward? Now, before giving their verdict, members of the jury must ask themselves, are they satisfied with the evidence? And the verdict, accidental death, then the gossips get to work, suicide, kindilett can't stand it, he leaves the place. He did it sir, doyce drove the girl to suicide, kindilett got him into the team, he knew suspicion would rest on morring, raille and setchley because they all had motives. And then team loyalty would keep the story quiet. It was all set for him sir, kindilett's your men. Can you see a Mr. Kindilett, sir? Wouldn't it be funny if Mr. Kindilett called? Show him in. Oh hello kindilett, glad to see you. Slade, look her Slade, there's something I gotta tell you. I kept quite about it up to now, but since poor Gwen Lee's- - was is it about this? Oh, oh, you know already. You better have a drink. What here sir? Oh, I think so Clinton, purely medicinally of course. Get some glasses, will you? Help yourself, sergeant. Thank you, sir Now listen kindilett, you yourself say that you now hold doyce responsible for your daughter's death and yet you put him in the trojan team for the arsenal match. Well, I love football, it's my whole life, he was a brilliant player and the team needed doyce, does that make sense? Perhaps, but I'm only a policeman. What about the others? There were three trojans in the old Saxon rovers apart from doyce. Was your daughter particularly fond of anyone? The whole team adored her. Morring, setchley and raille included. What do you mean? You said something in your evidence about a ring. Yes, on her dressing table. But your daughter didn't tell you that she was engaged. No. Then you can't be certain, you were the only person to see this ring kindilett, are you quite sure that you didn't mistake it for something else? Well, I suppose it's possible, it was a long time ago, I really don't know. Are you quite sure that this ring existed? But sir. What are you getting at Slade? This, the only reason we have for believing in the existence of the fiance is your evidence about the ring. Give him another drink Clinton. Yes sir. One last question, kindilett. We policemen sometimes have rotten jobs, we get to like people instead of treating them as chessmen. I want you to help me, do you know who killed John doyce? I've told you all I can Slade. Tomorrow is the deadline. I shall have all the proof I need from the rest after the match. But why the fishing hat? This is the hat I make my arrests in. All set, sir. Oh, let's go, oh George, don't forget to do your stuff. Hello, it's for you inspector. Oh thank you, hello, yes, what? Good heavens, all right, I'll be there goodbye. You may not know it, but this is going to be your big day sergeant. Okay you fellas, try and forget what happened if you can, play your usual game, but remember today we're not playing to beat the arsenal or anything of that sort or to break a record, we're just playing to show that whatever happens, the game still goes on, you see? That's all, I know you'll all do your best. Oh hello George old chap, good luck. Oh, thanks. Good afternoon trojans. Hmm, it's that man again. For the last time, I hope. Well, this business isn't cleared up yet and maybe it never will be. All I want to do is to wish you a great game and no hard feelings about what's gone before. Oh inspector, may we have the treatment room opened? We always have it opened on match days, you know? Yes, of course, no use to US. Thank you much, thank you. Come along boys, it's time for you now, and don't let them rush you at the big game, just play your usual game and you'll be all right. Coming frank? Oh Clinton, get the bowl down. Very good, sir. Just a little trap Clinton to catch our murderer red-handed. Just let him try and get his ring back now without giving himself away. Put that away please. What is that stuff, sir? Bromophenol. What's it for? Take your glove off. You'll soon find out. For now sergeant, I want you to go to the trainer's box, I'll join you there in a minute. Very good, sir. Sergeant. Sir. Torn your programme miss, here have mine. Thank you. Hey, seen the inspector? He went half an hour ago serg. What, went, what do you mean? Well, he was called back to headquarters on another job, he said for you to carry on. He left you this, said it would bring you luck. Blimey. Blimey. Hello, get me Scotland yard, get me inspector Slade, quick. I don't know where he is, you'll have to find him. Yes, yes, what, who is it, oh it's you Clinton? Yes sir, sorry sir, what do I do now sir? Do? Well you can't do anything, till the ring"s gone from the horsehair bowl. It's still there, sir. Well, that's interesting. Yes, that's all right, kindilett's taking his time if it is kindilett. Look, wait till after halftime. Take it easy, I'm not a player here, what's the matter? What is all this, what is all this? Looking for the inspector, sergeant? Try a slice of lemon sergeant, that's sharp. Come on Carter, give these boys a rubdown. Come on boys. It's gone, sir. Well of course it's gone you fool! That's why I put it there. Now let's, look out you silly, now arrest the man who's taken it. That'll be the murderer, because he's the only person who knew it was there. Yes sir, but how am I to know who's taken it sir? Well, look at your hands you idiot! Blimey, the bromo's here, sir. The brand of Cain, Clinton, now find someone to match and arrest him, good bye! Excuse me. Thank you. Frank, your fella raille's like a man possessed, does he always play like that? May I trouble you again? - Certainly. - Thank you. Thank you very much. Well played old man, what's happened to your head? It's a black as ink. All right, take it easy raille. But I don't understand. Oh good man Clinton, I knew you could do it. Well, of course it was raille, he was Mary kindilett's fiancee. He killed doyce for driving Mary kindilett to suicide and he killed Gwen Lee to stop her from talking. Yes sir, I see sir. Oh and Clinton, give morring my congratulations. But how did you know? Elementary my dear Watson. Ask them to come to the show tonight. Wardrobe! Props! Now then boys, come along. If we're gonna get this show on tonight-
