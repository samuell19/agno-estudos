Cay, sweetheart, be careful, why don't you get down from there? You were supposed to get rid of those or burn them. That's what the red tags mean. Ah... What happened over there? We're all a little worried about you. Lord knows if it were me in your shoes, I, I don't know what I would do. Owh, mommy, mommy! Daddy! What's wrong, Cay? My arm, it hurts!

Let me put it like this. Mommy? Yeah? Where is this place? Who is this man? It's nobody, honey. Please, please, no more fried chicken. It is not chicken. In America it's chicken. I want to cook again. Listen, eating out is cheaper and easier. Are you ready? Yeah, I am. Okay. How do I look? You look really handsome. I'll be right back, Cay. Can I come? Here you go. Thank you. I'm sorry ma'am. When can I call my mother and father? Mommy? Is, "are beautiful and useful", a sentence or a sentence-fragment? Justin? Yeah? How long 'till dinner? Uh, 30, 45 minutes, 'till the sauce is done, why? I'm just gonna get in a quick lift. Mattie? Cay, wait. Your supper's cold. I lost track of time. Sorry.

You know why! You almost killed your daughter over this shit! Mattie... Stop! Daddy... Come here, we're gonna go. Justin, Justin... In that house you'll have a great big kitchen, with a deep, deep freezer. And if I don't? Trust me, you'll be cooking again, and we'll get very fat. But how? Where, where are you going to get the money? Life is about sacrifices, Fereshta. Please... Fereshta, don't worry so much, okay? It's not good for me, not good for the baby, rest. Okay. Yeah? Do you have batteries? Uh, triple A, double A, nine-volt, I got some C's... Dude what the hell, I told you not here! I need it now. Please. And a pack of reds. Checkmate. No fair! It's legal, hey Cay! Nobody likes a sore loser. God forbid. Well when she becomes the next Supreme Court judge, everyone will be thanking me. I don't wanna join the army. Yeah. Well... Dude what the hell, I told you not here! I need it now. It's all there, you don't need to count it. Yeah, thank you. Hey, I don't wanna see your ugly face in here again. It's all there, you don't need to count it. It's not going to change a thing, Fereshta. Please, for me. For your unborn child. If God made it so simple, everyone would have a passport to salvation. They made prayers one of the five pillars of Islam for a reason. Fereshta, life is a test. Then every killer would turn to pray to Allah, right? And have their redemption. Oh fine, I will pray for you then. Pray. Please watch over my husband tonight. He has done much for his family's safekeeping. Please watch over him. Off to the night shift. Hard being a single mom, isn't it? Listen Justin. Very funny, mom. I can have the divorce papers ready in the morning. Please listen to me. Stop it okay, I told you to drop it, and don't talk like that around Cay. She screwed you over pretty good. Drop it, good night mom. Justin... Don't let her stay up tonight. Lies, you cannot build a life here with lies. Will you stop thinking of yourself for one second? Hopes and dreams, that's all this is. You sold off Zachary's portrait, for what? For one lousy shot at life! Tomorrow will come, and everything will still be the same. If something happens to me tonight, go to my uncles in Fremont. Oh... Oh help... Hello? Anybody there? Hello?!

We're just gonna make the bastard pay, now grab her goddamn legs. Come on! You have to stop them, you have to stop them. You're, you're police. You're a woman. From the market, why? Do you recognize me? I told you, I go to university to study sociology, that's it. My student visa expired. I wanted to stay in the country. I found someone who would sell to us. He kept raising the price. He said he'd go to Immigration. Your name is Baktoosh Nuri, say it. My name is Khalid Attaqi. Your name is Baktoosh Nuri, POI One-Seven-Delta. You are a credible threat, so fucking say it. I've never seen you before in my life. You have the wrong man, I swear. No... My name is Baktoosh Nuri. Again.

Confess to what, I haven't done anything. Please... This is all very simple Baktoosh. You confess to me and I let you live. Can you handle that? Your commanding officer sought me out. I remember you. You were always with him. Your team was after an elusive target, Korban Wali. It took much effort, but I helped you find him, at his private compound. But it wasn't his home. Well? It was my fault. You weren't supposed to be there, it was my fault. Not yours. What about the girl? I don't know a little girl. I just want to be with my family.

If you check on her one more time I will shoot you myself. I'm taking a piss. Psst. Khalid! Fereshta, get back, okay? Skaggs, go shut your girlfriend up. Damn man. God, when is this asshole gonna come collect his wife? Holy shit! Skaggs, go get him! Fuck you, this is your problem, you deal with it! Do it! Fereshta! No wait! Where is the rest of his papers!? It's in his jacket pocket. You leave. Leave! Mommy! Cay! No! No you shot the kid! Oh shit. You shot the kid! Get in the fucking car, now! Somebody help mommy! Oh you're going down, you're going down little lady. Hayaa! You're not supposed to do that. Anyway you're messing up all of these things. I love you mommy. I love you so much.
