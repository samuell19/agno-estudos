The first time I met him... Ayu. Dito. ...I felt nothing. From then on... not much changed. But after one farewell... I realized... we were more than friends. I've been in love with a girl. You, Cha. But I was so dumb that it took 100 more meetings for me to realize my feelings for him, and to finally choose him. You are still my best friend, right? Dito! What do you think? Are you sure you want to propose to me with an empty box? The ring is in there! Sorry, it was upside down. This is the second first time we met. Not as friends... but as a couple. It's so hot in here. Is the air conditioner working? Don't you feel hot? - No. - I feel so hot. Cha... What are you doing? - Are you out of your mind? - What do you mean? We're legally married now. We're allowed to do it. Well? To... Remember, you're my best friend. I know. You and I are best friends. So, since we're best friends... ...we should trust each other, right? Huh? You're creeping me out! - Come here, you! - Wait! What the hell are you doing? Come here! Come on, Cha. - This is the taste of our first night. - Are you playing hard to get? Stop! This is what you're getting for your first night with me. Quit it. TO AYU, DITO SO, THIS IS WHAT YOU TWO ARE REALLY LIKE - What are you doing? - Let's make a baby. Not right away. Dito! - Honey. - Yes? When we're done with the house, let's have a trip around the country and the world, okay? That's a must. It will also be a culinary trip, too. Help me move the sofa. We're going to take pictures and put them on our blog. Great idea. Why don't you come to our show then? Maybe after that we can... Travel? I'm so excited. - Nice job, To. - Of course. Ten million rupiah. Can you give me a discount? No. Do you think this is a flea market? - Honey... - Mm? I dream of living in a foreign country someday. I think that's a cool idea. What country do you have in mind? I don't know yet. Why don't we try that? Before we have children. Well, don't worry about children. Let's just enjoy things. Really? What kind of "things" do you mean? Flying kites! I mean, things like dating. Don't you remember that you friend-zoned me for 14 years? You've got a lot of making up to do. Come here. What are you doing? Do we have to cuddle like this? This is romantic. This is what couples do. - To... - Mm? People are staring at us. This is awkward. I'm her husband. Her husband. They understood. We're a match made in heaven. I thought we were going to change after we got married. At least be more mature. No, thank you. Come on, baby. But nothing changed. Well? I still got it, right? You nailed it. I know I'm good. I'm very cool, you know. - Have some of my sweat. - Stop it. That's gross! - Dry my sweat. - No way! Look at them. So childish. They look more like football buddies than a couple. They will calm down once they have a baby. That childish couple? I don't think so. - Guys? After-party? - All right! Can I come? - I'm coming, Itut! Wait for me! - Whatever, man. Wait for me, Pin! You know, back then... Way back then... I wasn't a tomboy at all. I purposely acted like that... just so I could hang around you. Huh? Then you had feelings for me, too, back then? I love you, Cip. I love you too, honey. Cip! Cip, it's too loud! Turn it off! Cip! What? I'm still sleepy. Don't wake me up yet. Wake up! We have plans today. Wake up. Okay. Dito, can you put your wet towels in the laundry basket? That's a gross habit. Wake up, Dito. Today's Eid al-Adha. We're going to Mom and Dad's house. Wake up! Dito! Wake up! Hurry up! Can't you wake your husband up nicely? - Take a shower, quick! Go! - You're mad. - Assalamu alaikum. - Waalaikumsalam. Dito, my boy. How are you, dear? I'm fine, thanks. What's up, new couple? - How are you? - Good, Mom. - How's your life as a couple? - Great, actually. Right, Cip? We're a very happy couple. Well, how do you feel now, knowing all about Dito's quirks? Quirks? My children have no quirks. No quirks, just some special habits. Like leaving his wet towel on the floor, his socks everywhere, and his underwear... Why don't you sit down while you're airing our dirty laundry? - Right, babe? - I'm thirsty. I can't believe you, Dito. - Let's eat, Cha. - I want a drink first. Can I have that? What's your problem? You seem extra touchy. Are you having your period? Do you think every time I'm upset, I'm having my period? I have valid reasons to be upset. If you could be a bit sweeter and neater, I wouldn't be upset at you. You're being annoying. Come on. We've been through this before. We were friends who were just like lovers... and now we're lovers who are just like friends. But now you're like a wolf in wife's clothing. Never mind. Forget it. I don't know why I'm upset either. Or maybe... Don't freak me out. That's impossible. We only just got married. You wouldn't get pregnant right away. Cip? Can we wait for the result together outside the bathroom? Cip? I need to use the bathroom. I can't hold it any longer, Cip! Come on... Cip... I'm just kidding. Did I get my friend pregnant? This is fake, right? It's not my child, right? To! But what about our plans? Can you be a little more supportive? This is all your fault! How dare you make me pregnant? Come here! You're going to give birth to our baby! We're going to have a baby, Cip! Bye! Dito! Are you ready? One, two... - Honey... - Mm? I don't think I'm ready to have a baby. If I'm really pregnant... and it changes me... will you still love me? Hm... That depends. If you change into a man, things will get confusing. I'm not joking around. Well, I am. What changes are you talking about? Getting ugly or fat? Don't worry. It won't affect my love for you. It won't tear us apart. Are you worried... because of watching those movies? Movies where the woman gets a giant belly, and suddenly it blows up... boom, blood splattering all over the room, whoosh, covering people's faces, and everybody screams? I'm just kidding. Jeez. I promise you, there's a doctor out there who knows how to calm you down, okay? Your baby is around one centimeter in size. It's a peanut baby. It's a normal size for an eight-week-old baby. Eight weeks old? But we've only just found out she's pregnant. I once had a patient who didn't even realize that she was pregnant. She thought she was just fat. We're done here. So, any more questions? - What will the labor be like? - That will depend on your condition. The first sign will be contractions. They'll be similar to how the cramps feel during your period but one one hundred times more painful. If you go with having a C-section, we'd just cut across you right here. Then we'd take out the baby and stitch you up afterwards. You'd get to choose the desired date for your baby's birthday. But if you choose normal labor, you'll have to wait until the opening is wide enough to deliver the baby. All you have to do is push the baby out. Sometimes it can take hours, and sometimes just minutes. Whoosh! And the baby's born. But the worst-case scenario is... Complications. For example, bleeding, vaginal tears, preeclampsia, or your birth canal being too small. So, then we'd need to... Of course it will hurt. Having a baby is painful, especially you when I gave birth to you. It was so painful and took so long, I still can't believe it. When I gave birth to your sister, the process was so fast. I just pushed, and there she was. You have to stay active during your pregnancy. When I was pregnant with him, I still worked out, doing a lot of walks and eating a lot. I had no problem giving birth to Dito, and he was a healthy baby. Here, taste this. I already blew on the porridge to cool it down. I made this for you. Don't give in to your morning sickness. If you feel nauseous and throw up your food, just eat again. How about this? Cip... Cip? I need to research pregnancy myself. Asking other people only freaks me out more. Nobody told you to listen to all of them. Don't take them seriously. Everybody has their own experience.

Oh, boy. - But you haven't packed. - Not a problem. Please? Huh? - Okay? Please, To. - Okay. - Go pack your bags. - I will. Just wait. - What? - Give me three minutes. - I want the earliest flight to Balikpapan. - Let me check first. We have two seats for the one o'clock flight. We'll take that. - Business class? - Yes. Here. The total price will be eight times that of your previous booking. - All good? - Sir? Yes, go ahead. Here are the tickets and your credit card. Thank you. I need to use the bathroom first. Mm. Cip, let's go. - Come on. - I want to stay here. I need to rest. Cip, let's go. Get ready. I'm already very late. Why don't you stay with me for a while? Then you can get there in time for the sound check. You said you wanted to support me, but you've been a burden so far. I really don't have any energy left. You always say that when it comes to any of my gigs. Get up! You can do it. Let's go. You want me to get up? Do you think I'm not bothered by these changes in my body? Huh? - So, change your attitude. - How? This is hormonal. This is how pregnant women are. No. You're just giving up on yourself. I know you're strong. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Yes... That's what you think I've been doing? Every time I feel nauseous, fatigued and emotional, do you think I don't try to fight it? I'm tired of asking for your understanding. If it's going to be like this, I wish the baby was gone. - You... - What about me? You're out of your mind. She's unbelievable, trust me. There's not a single reason to get upset, and yet she explodes. Hang in there, To. It's just for a few more months. This many months. Do you think it will end once she gives birth to the baby? Wait until the baby is born, starts school and has a fight. He was the one who fought, but the principal calls me! "I'm sorry, Mr. Johnny, but you need to discipline your son." My name is Jul. Johnny is my son's name! Your life belongs to your son now. See you, guys. Miss being single? To... When my wife was pregnant... ...she was as cranky as your wife. Mood swings and all. Do some couple exercises. Yoga maybe? I've tried, many times. But she has millions of excuses, so I've stopped asking. To, I understand. Being a father is exhausting. Very exhausting, actually. But when your arm gets tired, do you massage it or cut it off? - Of course I massage it! - There you go. Same goes for Ucha. Good luck, To. Cip... I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I don't even know what I did wrong. Do you remember what we were fighting about? It was a big fight, right? After all this time, you should know... that this is how I am when I'm pregnant. I don't have any ridiculous cravings or anything. I just want to be around you. If my pregnancy ruins our relationship... I'd rather not have a baby, ever. Shh. What are you talking about? We agreed... to go through everything together. Right? But you always leave when you feel we're having a fight. A few harsh words make you leave the house. No. It's not that. Listen... I didn't want to explode in front of you. But it hurts me more if you just leave me like that. - Oh? - It feels like you're rejecting me. What are you talking about? Absolutely not. I swear... it never once crossed my mind. Honey... Someday we're going to face worse problems than those we had today. Maybe we will yell at each other louder... but we should never leave the other one behind. I will never leave your side. So, this means you've forgiven me? Inhale. Hold it. What do we say? Happy mother, relaxed baby. Now hold your partner's hand. Right. Bring up the other arm to the side. Inhale... hold it. - Hello? - Ucha, what are you doing today? Are you free tomorrow? Let's hang out. Tomorrow... - I already have plans. - Which are to hang out with your BFFs. Jacqueline and me. If you don't come, I'm going to expose all your ex-boyfriends' names to every gossip tabloid I know of. Hi! Finally! You're here! Yay! - I miss you. - The expectant mother. Let's sit. - Yes. - Finally. I feel so ugly hanging out with you girls. Who cares? You're pregnant. Even if you showed up in your pajamas, no one would care. - She's right. - Seriously... Well, what have you been doing lately? Tomorrow I have a modeling gig in JFW. You two should come. Tomorrow's a working day. I can't. Please? Tell them you have a meeting with a client. I used that excuse yesterday when I went for a date. OMG, with who? Do we know him? I don't think so. But he told me he wants to have a serious relationship with me. But I feel like... How to say this? I can't stop thinking about being stuck at home, washing my husband's clothes every day and having school holidays as the only time I can travel. I don't think so. Maybe you're just not ready for it yet. Right, Cha? Yeah, maybe you are just not ready to start a family. Okay, stop talking about me. How's your life? Why me? I told you all about my life. It's your turn now. You always complain about stuff, and I always talk about modeling. - My dating life... - Yeah, but that's... Cip. Cip. Honey? Honey? Honey? Jeez! Cip, you almost gave me a heart attack! Cip? Honey. Mm? After we have this baby... can we still travel around the world? Honey. Cip... I think you need healing. When? Hmm... As soon as possible. I love you, Doc. Sorry, I can't. You're already taken. - Honey. - Mm? What name are we going to give the baby? Hmm... Bumi. It's not bad. Poetic... but not cringey. Right? The world. ♪ I finally worked it out ♪ ♪ What this is all about ♪ ♪ But this might be too late... ♪ Stop making faces. Cip. Mm? It's been a while since the last time we had a date. Can we spend this vacation just by ourselves? Oh, my! Do you miss me that much? ♪ You tried so hard and faced the truth ♪ ♪ I know 'cause I've been watching you ♪ ♪ Well, it's been six years or more... ♪ Mommy is so heavy now. Straighten the pose. Be one. Let's do squats. Lower squats for daddies and higher for mommies. To. To... Oops, sorry. Me and the mommy have become one... but not yet with the baby. Since we haven't met... it's harder to become one with him. - Sorry again. - Let's start again. The view is so beautiful. Very. - Are you tired? - Huh? No, I'm good. Don't worry. Go on. Are you excited about the walking exercise? Do you like it? Gosh. Cip. You know what? Don't you feel tired? And we've still got a fair way to go. It's a hot day, too. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm okay. I just need to pick up my pride... that fell into the paddy bushes. We still have a long way to walk. Thank goodness you've started to like food now. Mommy doesn't feel sick anymore. Right, honey? Honey? To! Huh? I'm talking to you. Why don't you answer me? Oh? You were talking to me? I thought you were talking to Mr. Baby. You should pay attention when your wife is talking to you. Even Mr. Baby pays attention to his mother. Enjoy your dinner, honey. Honey baby. Mm! It's delicious. Let's eat up. Is it good? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DINNER. To. It's noisy. LET'S MEET DON'T YOU MISS ME? AT THE USUAL BAR I'LL ASK MY WIFE FIRST SHE WON'T SAY YES Cip. Hm? Do we have any plans for tonight? I want to stay at home. Why? What if... I go out with my friends? No. This is our quality time. I won't be long. They're here, too, you know. No. And tomorrow we are scheduled for a check-up with the midwife. We need to get a good sleep tonight. You should get a good sleep tonight. Honey... Tell them to come hang out here. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - It's a nice big house. - I know, right? - This is for you. - Thank you. - Here or outside? - Outside's better. More breeze outside. Honey, the gang's here. Cha. Hey, Cha. How are... How are you? Sit down and relax. - So explosive. - You know her. - But is she okay? - Don't worry. Sit down and relax. Calm down. I'm the head of the family. You can relax. - Good to hear that. - Great. But once he spots her glaring at him, he'll immediately ask her to forgive him. "Yes, Cip. I know it was my fault, Cip." When you get married, you'll know how I feel. That's right. You might look tough, but inside you're Chibi Maruko-chan. But at least my profile picture is still mine, not my wife's photo! - Show us! - Look at that. You know, every time we chat, I feel uneasy, thinking she might think I'm cheating. But I know you love me. ...always include hug and kiss emojis in your texts. - That's him! - No, it's you! Get in here! Do you have to be that loud? Tell them to leave, or I will. I think we're in trouble. We should leave. But you said it was okay. If you'd let me go out to hang out, this wouldn't have happened. Oh... you want to hang out with them? Go ahead. Leave! Really? You don't love me anymore? Stop! Hey, my bro. How are you? Well? We'd better leave. Huh? No, please stay. No. I wish we'd known you needed some quality time with your wife. Relax. We've talked about it. You know I'm not scared of anything, right? But I swear to God, I'd rather get bitten by a kuda lumping dancer than deal with a pregnant woman. Let's go, guys. Please don't go. That's not cool, man. If this is the last time I ever see you... remember, it was a perfect friendship. - See you. Peace! - You're crazy. Dito... Don't forget. If your arm gets tired, massage it, don't... - Cut it off. - Mm. I love you, babe. Take care. They've left. Happy? I lost my temper. I'm sorry, but it wasn't me. It was the hormones acting out. Are you out of your mind? When did I marry a bag full of hormones? Since you got me pregnant. You said you wanted some quality time with me, but you prefer your friends over me! How long do I have to be constantly by your side? Am I not allowed to have a little break? Am I not allowed to relax a bit? Do you think you'll have breaks from being a parent? I'm the one who has to carry your child everywhere. If you can't give me support, the least you can do is not make me upset! What do you want from me? You want us to switch bodies? Should I shut my mouth? Or do you want me to leave and look for trouble outside? Stop, To! Hello? Okay, I'm coming. Cha... I don't understand. I left you for just a minute, and you started bleeding? Come on. What did you eat for breakfast? Mm? Are you tired? I told you to exercise regularly. You should start listening to me. Can you stop talking? You're making me feel worse. To! MIDWIFE PRACTICE MRS. ROBIN, MIDWIFE The baby is fine. He is a strong boy. Alhamdulillah. Is she upset about something? You'd better stay at home today. You need bed rest. Clear your mind of negative thoughts. Because happy mommy... Relaxed baby. Listen... Pregnancy is not just the mommy's business. It's the business of both parents. Everything you say, think... and even what you feel will affect the baby. You should give the baby love... not merely nutrition. Now... When was the last time you kissed? Feel better now? My belly? Your feelings. Do you think we are ready to become parents? I don't want to give up. If the baby is not giving up on us, then we shouldn't give up on him. I can't promise I'll stop blowing up at you, but I will always love you. I swear it. Cip? What is it? Why are you crying again? It's the hormones. Good. I'll love you, no matter what. I know. Shh! Don't laugh. I'm not. I'm touched. Being friends for 13 years doesn't lie. However mad I am at him, I'd never consider him my enemy. ♪ Nothing in the world is gonna beat this high ♪ ♪ I've been searching for... ♪ Well, this is new. Of course. Because the baby needs more than nutrition. He needs love, too. Oh... So, this is for the baby? - Yes. The big baby. - Okay. The baby who cried on the side of the road. My baby. What? I love you, too. I didn't get a chance to say it... because the whole village was watching us. Cip... Mm? It's been a while since the last time we... Hold that thought. The book says okay. Is it hot in here? - I need a swim! - To! Whee! Mr. Baby... you have a weird daddy... but Mommy loves him. This man's life is all about percussion. However, after he got married, he locked his instruments in the closet, well, even if only for a week, to support his beloved wife. Who is he? He's here with his wife. It's Dito and Ayudia. Whoo! You look beach fresh. Tell us all about your vacation to Bali. We did what all tourists do, Teh. We went shopping, to the beach, hiking. We stayed in bed... She's lying, Teh. Want to know the truth? Most of the time, we just stayed in bed. It was basically just like moving our bed to Bali. That's it. Oh, my God. He's complaining about her. She's pregnant, To. But why Bali? There are other places in Indonesia you can visit, such as Majalengka, Cibodas, Cipanas... Uh... For us, Bali is a special place. We've been there many times before... ...and we've made memories here and there. He already talks like a Westerner. "Memories." And we found a midwife who we think can help us deliver the baby normally. Are you planning to give birth in Bali? Yes, in Bali, with the help of a midwife. What's wrong? Did you know about this? - Of course, Teh. - As a couple, you should talk... Honey! Come here, quick. Bali? No. Way. And if something happens and you're all alone there, who's going to help you? If you want to give birth normally, do it in a hospital here. It's safer. I'm not sick. I don't want to give birth in a hospital. And we love Bali. And Mrs. Robin will help us. That's the most important point. Why are you so into holistic childbirth? Giving birth is not an easy job. Don't try to be a "hip-ser." "Hipster," Mom. We did our research, too. She got her midwife certification in the US, and her Bali clinic is well established. You're so stubborn. Find the best option in Jakarta first. If you think Mrs. Robin is the best choice after doing that, we won't object. - I still want to give birth in Bali. - I know. But we still have to check your pregnancy with a real doctor just in case, okay? Is your throat okay? It's been a while since you looked at me that way. What way? I don't understand. Since that honey came into your life... you've lost your love for this honey. There. That's it? I looked at you, just like you wanted. Cip, do you want to do it? It's okay, actually. Are you afraid you'll hurt the baby? No wonder there are many husbands cheating on their pregnant wives. They just don't have strong wills. Have you ever thought about cheating? I don't have time for that. Do you know what thoughts I have inside my mind? I'm like, "Has she eaten yet?" "What kind of food should I get for her?" "She looks tired. I think she needs a massage." Thank you... for being so patient with me. Three months left. Your pregnancy is going well. You may choose any way you like to deliver the baby into the world. - Then we're-- - But it's better to choose a C-section. You can pick the day, date and even the time you have your baby. You can wear full makeup before the surgery. - I don't-- - And we have a good Wi-Fi speed. The father can stream whatever live feed you want while the surgery's going. - Doctor... - Yes? Thank you for your help. You're welcome. Now, can you send all my records to my doctor in Bali, please? - I can recommend a friend of mine... - Thank you. Okay. Don't forget to exercise. Hey, that's my T-shirt! No, it's mine now. Oh? All right. What else do you want? What's this? Massage my feet. - You're unbelievable. - Wait! I'm thirsty. Pass me the milk. You're such a big baby. - Here. - Thank you. - Gently, To. - I know, Miss Fussy. Come on, Cip. You can do it! One more step. One more! Yay! Now go upstairs again. Taste this. - Well? - Mm! Let's eat. We're going to have lunch. Wow. I think you're ready to be left alone at home. But I don't want to be. If you go with me to Bali... who's going to provide for us? Do you really want to go alone? Really? You're thinking about it? You'd better watch it. Girls, a quick reminder: pregnant women are sometimes very sensitive. So, only tell happy stories. Don't criticize her body. - Don't brag about your body. - Okay. - No gossiping or bad mouthing anyone. - Okay. She's here, and so soon! Surprise! - Sit here. - You had time to do this for me? Of course! I asked you here, right? Thank you. - What is this? - We have lots of presents for you. Thank you! Go ahead. Have a bite. Who said that someone will get married? Who? I don't remember. The jolliest one. She's the one. Girls, I'd like to make a toast. But since this lady is not allowed to drink, let's raise our empty glasses. Sir? Thank you. May everything go well with the delivery, and may the baby be born healthy. I'm sure you'll be great parents to your child. Amen. Cheers. Cha, any advice for the single ladies here? A little speech? Enjoy single life. You can never go back to it again. Make the most of it. Party hard... work hard, travel hard... and fall in love hard. Well... Because once your body grows to be like mine now... even moving a little bit drains your energy. Can you see my legs? Well, I haven't seen them in over a month. I just bought this dress yesterday because the dress I bought last month won't fit anymore. I feel sorry for my husband. - I yell at him for no reason at all. - Cha... When you look like this... you want one thing and one thing only. To meet your baby as soon as possible. So that your body... your mood... and your feelings... can finally be yours again. Okay. Thank you for your advice. A round of applause, girls. I don't want to make a speech again. Ever. It was that bad, huh? Just forget about it. At least you got a chance to get everything off your chest. Feeling better now? Cip. Mm? Cip. Yeah? Cip... Between... me and Mr. Baby... who do you like more? Stop talking nonsense. I'm not joking. Between me and Mr. Baby... who do you love more? Mr. Baby... or me? Honest answer. So far... it's you. "So far"? Of course. I haven't even met Mr. Baby. - Maybe when he-- - Okay, bye. Honey, I'm kidding. Look at me. Are you jealous of the baby? Jealous? Of my own child? That's impossible. Maybe a little. Okay, fine. A lot. I'm so jealous. You look happier with him than you do with me. The way you look at him... the way you caress him... and talk to him... You seem to love him more than you love me. You're being ridiculous, you know? I know it sounds ridiculous... but the feeling is real. Honey, look at me. Come on. Listen to me carefully. There's a difference between my love for you and my love for him. He's a gift from God. A gift. But I chose you. I chose you 13 years ago as my best friend. So, please... don't compare yourself with any other person ever again. Because you are so special to me. Yeah! My babies love me. Oh, my God. - Please come in, ma'am. - Thank you, kind sir. This is like a home. Wait till you see this. Ta-da! - To, it's beautiful. - Ten million rupiah. You can enjoy that view if you miss this face. Ha, ha, ha! Hm... Mock me as you please. Let's see who's going to cry when I leave. - Want to bet? - Okay. - Let's find out tomorrow. - Okay. Deal. - Deal. - Deal. I don't want to leave. I want to stay here with you. You're going to miss your flight, To. Take care of yourself, Cip. - I will. - You'll call me every day, right? - Mm hmm. - Reply to my text messages, okay? I'm not joking! I will, To. Mr. Baby... take care of your mom, okay? The easy one or the right one. Today, we chose the right one. We chose to be apart for the sake of the baby. Our second farewell was kind of bombastic. - To, are you home now? - Yes. Have you eaten? Try to eat something, even just a bite. If you get hungry in the night, there's no one there to get you food. Honey... let's talk on the phone till I fall asleep. It feels like I'm still trying to win you. - I don't think you ever tried. - Good point. Good morning, Mr. Baby. I bet your daddy is still sleeping. - Can I read the menu first? - Of course, ma'am. HAVE YOU EATEN? IT'S SO LONELY EATING ALONE... You can do it, Cip. You can do it! I can do it. You can do it, Cip! You're a champ! It's not exercise if it doesn't make you tired. Do I miss you that much, To? You can do it, Cip! I've even started to miss your yelling. Don't talk to yourself. People will think you're crazy. I don't care. A pregnant woman can do what she wants. I can do it! It's funny how you're always fighting when you're together, - but once you're apart... - Hello! We're about to go on stage, To! Oy! - What? - Stop staring at your phone. - What are you doing here, Cha? - Honey? Finally, he calls me honey. Boom! Do you miss me, To? Don't touch me. You're giving me fever. How about you caress me instead? Do you want me to caress you? Come here. Slap! One, two, three... Lower your hands, still crossing the legs. Stretch your legs forward. Cip, don't slack off. If you want to give birth naturally, you need to be fit. I don't have enough motivation to do it alone. But you're not alone. Half of me is there with you, there in Mr. Baby. But I can't hold the hands of this honey. I've noticed you've become a big baby during your pregnancy. Well, no excuses. You should exercise every day. - Mm... - Okay? Okay. - And don't forget to eat, okay? - Yes, honey. The number you are calling is busy. Please try again in a moment. The number you are calling is busy... ARE WE STILL ON FOR TONIGHT? I'M GOING TO TAKE A BATH IF WE ARE. TAKE A BATH, PLEASE. I DON'T WANT YOUR LAPTOP TO PASS OUT. Hi, To! - Hi, Cip. - Thanks for the flowers. This is so unlike you! I want tonight to be romantic. Well, am I cool or what? Freak. You know what? I tried to cook my own dinner, but I burned it. See? What did you do? Well, not the whole thing, just this side. So, I think your dinner is better than mine. Let me taste your food. "Ah"! Mmm! How dare you! Your doctor is ready. Let me lead the way. Thank you. You said you wanted a natural childbirth? Yes, Doc. What's wrong? During the final weeks of pregnancy, the baby should have adjusted into its descent position, meaning head down, feet up. That's the right position to deliver the baby without surgery. However, your baby is... What do you mean? My baby's in breech position? Just to be safe, I'm suggesting a C-section. But, Doc, is there any other option? Hello. Cip? What did the doctor say? Honey... I think I'd better have a C-section. What made you suddenly change your mind? The baby is not in the right position for a natural birth. I'm afraid of having a C-section... but if I have to... Just calm down. The baby... Stop with the negative thinking. How about you talk to Mr. Baby... and tell him to stay healthy. Stay healthy, Mr. Baby. Say, "I want you to be a member of our family." I want you to be a member of our family. - We're ready. - Just a sec. Cip. I will be there as soon as I can. We can discuss this in person, okay? Honey. Yes? We have to pick a date. Hm... Which date do you want? May 21st, so he won't be a Gemini baby. Oh? What's wrong with being a Gemini baby? Nothing, actually. - Cip. - Mm? Can I do a take for a while? Talk to Mr. Baby. Ask him... when he wants to come into the world, okay? Okay. - Cip? - Yes? I love you. Bye. Bye. C-section? Natural? Hm... Your belly is starting to get in the way. Honey. I don't think a C-section is an option. What? But the doctor said you should. Are you sure? I think I can give birth to him without surgery. I asked Mr. Baby, too. - Are you sure? - Mm. - So, we wait? - Yes. Okay. But you should listen to everything I said. You can't slack off... and you should eat properly for natural delivery. You should be fit when it's time. As long as you're there with me, I'm all for it. Silly girl. - You want one? - Yes! Do you want some ice cream, Mr. Baby? - He said yes! - Really? - Yeah! - All right. Let's go inside. Okay. ♪ I'm out of love ♪ ♪ But with you, it's different ♪ ♪ You leave me hoping... ♪ - Don't hide. - I'm embarrassed. But you look so pretty. ♪ Drowning in my fantasy ♪ ♪ Should I stay... ♪ Come here, To. To. How about we name our baby "Sekala"? It means "visible." Sekala? Sekala Bumi. Or something-something Sekala Bumi. Or Sekala something-something Bumi. Right? Gianyar Sekala Bumi. - Jawara Sekala Bumi! - Shh! - Sekala is a good name, right? - Sekala. Sekala Bumi. When did you develop a video recording hobby? I want to document every moment. Just go along with it, okay? Okay? No, don't include me. You don't need to do any acting. Just act naturally, okay? Hi, guys. This is what we do every day. What do you usually say? "...else I'll get angry." Am I right? Stop it, or I'll slap you. - Um... - What? What's wrong? I think I'm having a contraction. Are you sure? Yeah, but they're not too close together. Can you still walk? I think so. Good. - Hey, guys. We're at... - To. This is not the time to make a vlog. This is the time for Dito-Ayu. Dita. Dia. We can use that name! Dia. It's our name combined. Dito-Ayu. Dia Sekala Bumi? Yeah? Hold on. We need to ask Mr. Baby first. Mr. Baby... do you agree to your new name? Dia Sekala Bumi. Cip? How did he do that? How cool is that? - He's my son. - Yeah, right. You're cool, bro! To. - What? - It's time. - Are you sure? - Yes. - The contractions are ten minutes apart. - Okay. Let's go. Are you okay? I thought it was you screaming. What's wrong with that lady? Why is she screaming like that? Say something, Cip. Waste of energy. - To... - Yes? - To? - Yes? - Massage my back. - Okay. - Hurry up. - Okay. Drink this. You are doing great, Ayu. Can I talk alone with you? Yes. Dito... the risk for your wife's labor is quite high. This is a breech delivery. We have to be ready for the worst-case scenario. - Worst case? - Yes. Ma'am... she still can do it, can't she? She's physically and mentally capable. But if her energy gets drained, she might not be able to push the baby out. We need to rush Ayu to the hospital to have a C-section if that happens. We're not taking any chances. All right. I understand. I agree with you. Let's call the ambulance then. But can I ask you something? Does Ayu need to know about the ambulance? Of course not. Thank you, ma'am. Get the ambulance ready to go anytime. Drink this. Honey... You look prettier today. The baby is coming. Breathe. Cip... Breathe, Cip. Come on. Come on, Mr. Baby. Come out. How much longer, ma'am? I need a moment. AYU'S MOTHER It's Ayu's mother. - Hello. - Have you heard any news from Dito? No, I've been waiting for his call, too. Mr. Baby... Baby... Mommy wants to meet you. To... Son... this is your daddy. I know you're comfortable in there. Right? But you know what? There are more fun things to do out here. You'll get a lot of toys. You can play music, too. - There are a lot... - A lot of beautiful things. Baby... Everybody wants to meet you, Sekala. Please come out. Everybody loves you. Mommy loves you. Daddy loves you, too. Daddy loves you so much. - Honey... - Cip. - Honey... - Quick, Cip. Mrs. Robin, it's Ayu. Breathe, honey. Breathe. Okay, it's time. You can still do it, right? It's time, Cip. One moment. Hold your wife from behind. Push. One, two, three, push! Good. Push. Can you do it? Do you want to get a C-section? - Push. - Don't ever say those words again. I don't want to get pregnant again. I swear to God, if you ever try to touch me again... One more push. I can see the baby now. Push again. A big one! Push! Yes, beautiful! Congratulations! He's beautiful. Look at him, Cip. He has big eyes like us. ♪ You truly are my mother ♪ ♪ And you truly are my father ♪ ♪ You truly are my relative ♪ ♪ And you truly are my friend ♪ ♪ You truly are my knowledge ♪ ♪ And you truly are my wealth ♪ ♪ You truly are my all ♪ ♪ My god of gods ♪ To... Cip, it's your turn. Please... I lost count of how many times I've fallen in love with Dito. This time, it's not as a friend... or a boyfriend... or a husband, but as a parent. I love you, honey. Let me hold him. Guys, take a look at the woman who's no longer pregnant. - Can I hold him? - Are you sure? - Yeah! - Let me see my dear grandson. My baby... Yeah! Gosh! Finally. - Congrats. - Thank you. - Cip. - Mm? Look at that. Your boy is so cute. He's yours, too, silly. No, I don't want it. Where are you going? I'm going to tell on you. - Dito... - If time stops right here... No, I don't want time to stop. I want to know how our story goes. What if we...
