I know all about your smuggling. Shall I list what came in 3 days ago? Forget it. Too long. My man will state the amount. You choose where to hand it over. Or I call the cops.

Bastard! Trying to kill me? We're not going to kill you. Just teach you some manners. Let him go or we shoot! Wanna shoot us both? Be my guest! He's coming with me till I'm in the clear. Teach me some manners? You asked for it. Keep your word this time. Or I'll tell my husband, even if he kills me. Why would I kill my golden goose? I'd rather die by my husband's hands than keep a devil like you alive. I'll report you for doing opium. Don't be stupid. If you squeal on me for opium, I'll tell them about your husband, the gang boss. If you tell him about us, he'll cut you, and you'll be stuck with me. You know his rules. And a boss can't break his own rules. -But you raped me! -Yeah, I did. And you still didn't tell him, because of his rules. Doesn't matter how it started. You can't get rid of me. Let me go! Leave me alone to decide. The decision isn't yours, boss. We deal with her by our rules. Get out. -The boss's wife is no exception. -Relax. Relax? Look at my face! -Shut up! -What you scared of? We'll skip the pleasantries. Adultery will be punished by our rules. Let me see my husband just once. Then I'll accept any punishment. Bitches who cheat get their faces cut up. Anyone who helps her get rid of the scars will get it worse. Under no circumstances can she leave her lover. How did you do it? Show me! Do it to me! I want to feel her pain! Did you ruin her eye, like yours? I was about to, but I took pity on her. Her eye should be fine. You think? You're an old hand at it. Get out! I'll pay you tomorrow. You want credit? Yes. So you're asking for a favor? Right? I've a favor to ask, too. How about it? Pay up tomorrow! Stop right there. -I'll kill you! -The clothes are the bait. How else can I hook customers? You don't have to do it anymore. Lately the boss just sits around doing nothing. He feels guilty about his ex-wife. It's eating him alive. I say his heart's getting weak. And it's weakening us all. Our income has shrunk, other gangs are writing us off. He doesn't have what it takes to lead us. That's going too far. This puny bar can't feed us all! But we can't jump the gun. Why don't we keep an eye on him a little longer? -Shut up, mole-face! -Why you one-eyed... -Go sell the booze! -Prick! You have something to say to me? Come in. Keeping stuff bottled up will make you sick. What's bothering you? It isn't my personal opinion but our collective one. Which is? Your heart's not in the business. -You're saying my heart's gotten weak? -Yes, sir. Why don't you be the boss then? You could do with a vacation. I'll cut out my heart to show you. Wait outside. Chauffeur! Let's see how weak my heart is. Use that on your hand. I'll go first. -Your turn. -I can't. The rain's really coming down. -Let's have some fun! -Want some fun? Idiot! What the... Ooh, caught a big fish, huh? -She works on rainy days, too? -So it seems. Here they come. -This is the place? -You must be the leftovers! You'll be cheap then. How much? -We're early birds! -All night or a quickie? Quickie. Cheapskate! A big boy like you? You don't want her. -A pretty face won't turn you on. -Right. -Listen. -Come on. If the mood's right, I might give it to you for free. Let's go. -Come on. -Lead the way. Leaving a bruise on my guiless heart Memories fade away like mist Shedding tears in a shadowed alley A woman strokes her black hair Oh sun, shine on me too Looking for a date? Only if it's cheap. -Let's see the cash first. -Fine. Gimme a kiss first. -Stop that! -Come on! What the... Hag! You tricked me! Gimme back my money! You don't have to look at my face. What? You'll give me nightmares! I want my money back! Now! What the... Hey! Come back here! What's up? This whore tried to con me. -Cool it! -Piss off! Only assholes hit women! Beat it! I'm in the mood. You game? Lead the way. What the... You found this in the trash? -Howdy, ma'am. -This way. Where are you taking me? -Here. -This one? Yes. What you waiting for? -You have guests! -Honey, buy that for me. Honey? He's your husband?!! Cheapskate! Who's talking to you? Thanks. -Here you go. -Thanks. Bye. Let¡¯s go. -Come again. -I will. See you. Eat up. Seems she hooked another idiot. -Can I have a room? -Short? Or long? I barely have enough rooms for my girls. -No room? I'm off then. -No, wait. Sorry about that. You still pay full rate! We must pay upfront for the room. How much? Five... Don't scare him off in the middle of the night. I told you I'd fix your face if you work for me. Stop holding out. -Sorry about the room. -As long as the woman's good. -How come she's so mean? -So she can charge more. You don't work for her? -I work alone for now. -I see. Why's the room so small? -I'll turn off the lights. -Yeah. No goodbyes? I've something to ask you. Come here. Huh? Now I see. That's why you didn't let me touch your face. Don't shout. I'll give you back your money. What? A refund? As an apology. Who cares? It's not like we got married or anything. I had a good time. It'd be nice to have breakfast together, but my cab shift starts at dawn. Why don't you get your face fixed? Oh, no money. When I have my own cab, I'll fix your face. This isn't pity, so just take it. Take it! What took you so long? Who's the idiot who kept you till the sun came up? Hand it over. I got beaten up and didn't earn a cent. Like I'll believe your crap. We have to eat, don't we? Who was so generous? I picked the cabbie's pocket. Clever girl! I'll kill him if he touches you. -Then you want me to quit? -I mean other than for work. -Daeseong Apartments, please. -Daeseong? -Is there a problem? -Not at all. -Wait here. -Hey! Mister! I've been conned! Wait after knocking! Yes? Everyone's waiting. Hurry up. Hey! Mad at me? Fine! -Ja! -Oh no! -Ja! -Just a minute! -Were you napping? -Yeah. What brings you here? Just passing by. -Still work in that bar? -I switch bars tomorrow. Why don't you just quit? -The guilt is killing me. -What guilt? Our parents didn't leave us a thing. So we have to earn a living. I'll earn enough for both of us! I can't ask that of you. What am I, a stranger? -Even siblings outgrow each other. -How can you say that? It's true! Once you're married, you'll be too busy for me. -No use talking to you. -Leaving? -Yeah. -I'll drop by soon. -Where are you working tomorrow? -Earth Bar. Earth Bar? OK. -Go back to bed. -Alright. -And behave yourself! -Stop nagging! -See? We almost got caught. -I should've said hello. A college boy dating a bar girl? He won't like you. But he's your brother! He approves of me, but not who I date. That makes no sense. Keep your hands to yourself. -What does your brother do? -You didn't see him? He sounds like the cabbie who brought me here. You mean he's waiting outside? Bloody idiot. I've been conned. Reminds me of old times, when I was ten and still crying for your breast. I may have nursed you, Master, but I sinned against your ancestors. My breast milk was evil. It turned you into an evil man. The baby I nursed grew up to be... You¡¯re so cruel! Your own wife... Quiet! Nanny, put this house under her name. Yes, Master. -This is the manager. -We go back to junior high. I see. Where were you before this? -The Monaco. -Posh place. Hold on. -Isn't her hair pretty? -Yeah. -Who is she? -Never seen her before. -His girlfriend? -Mistress more like it. What brings you here? I need to talk to him. You know you're not allowed to see him. Please. -He's not here anyway. -Please let me see him. This way, then. -Did you see her face? -No. -This side. -What? No gossiping at work! Tell me and I'll pass on your message. I have to tell him myself. Is it important? It's personal. Wait here. What if he takes pity on her? Can't have that. The boss mustn't set eyes on her. We'll take you to him. Chauffeur! We put her in the jeep. Don't tell the boss she was here. -Why not? -Just don't. Keep your mouth shut. Sorry but we¡¯ll have to kill you. Your life's not worth living anyway. Since you can't fix your face, you're better off dead. Think of it as a mercy killing. Get your last whiff of male flesh. You're gonna knock heads with a train. Don't run! Wait for me! So what's your story? I'm curious. Don't ask. You'll get hurt. I can tell someone is after you, but what I don't get is why you don't go to the cops. I'm going back. It's not that I'm an ingrate. They'll take terrible revenge on anyone who pities or helps me. So I must go. I'm cursed. Break the spell then. Let me go. I killed a man thanks to you. Who? The guy I pushed onto the rails. So I can't report them even if I knew their crimes. But I can't hide my crime forever. What are you going to do? If I keep you here they'll track you down. Then I¡¯ll know who I'm dealing with. -You mustn't! -Quiet! Sorry for yelling. I can't turn a blind eye to injustice. Even if it means I get a criminal record. But first, let's fix your face. I don't have my own cab yet, but I know a plastic surgeon. The guy who took her will want to fix her face. So keep an eye on every plastic surgeon. Time to help a friend in need. -What is it? -What? First we take an oath. -I'm in. -I'm in. Amen. Now study the woman in this photo. Take one each. Cosmetic Surgeon Plastic Surgery Cosmetic Surgery You must be tired. How did it go? Can't I have a peek? You can gawk all you want after she's out. She'll be a knockout. I wasn't pretty to begin with. I don't want my woman looking like a doll. -I'd rather she be sexy. -You said it. I have to go. I left the car running. Go. -See you tomorrow. -Sure. -I'll go back to my room. -Sure. Taxi! -Where's your depot? -Wangshimni. -And your place? -Why you asking? -You look familiar. -Youngcheon Apartments. Youngcheon? She's a looker. -I'm the one who should be mad. -What? You're the one cheating on me! I'm innocent, I tell you! You're no private investigator, so who'd hire you? What a sorry excuse! You got it all wrong! I can see right through you! Look at her! She's too old for me! She'd be even more desperate for you then. Unbelievable... Thank you. Once you fix your inner scars, I'll propose. What's wrong? It's dangerous. Hi! Oh, hi. What's up? Come on in! -What's up? -Oops, I'll come back later. -Hey, Ja! -Sorry! I'll drop by later. -Your sister? -The only family I've got. -Why isn't she living here? -She says we've outgrown that. It's past eight! How about dinner? -Wanna eat out? -No. Then we'll eat in. I'm a swell cook, just so you know. Women are so bad at cooking. My mother cooked all her life, but she still burnt the rice every other day. Women are hopeless... -I'll do it. -Really? Women are still better cooks, huh? Go ahead then. So what would you like? I'm supposed to ask you that. What do I know? Been single too long. Ja will jump to conclusions. She's real smart. Why not invite her over for dinner? Good idea. I'll go get her. But... Oh, right. You need money for groceries. Here's the key to that cabinet. Take some cash and cook up a storm. Bitch. -Cleaned yourself up. -You can't take that! No? Come along. We'll let your hubby play judge. I want to watch him cut up both of your faces. -I won't go! -No? Can¡¯t drag in the boss's wife like a dog, can I? Enjoy your last night with the cabbie then. I'm here to see the boss! I'm a guest! What the... -You! -What the... -I came to see the boss! -What's going on? I've something urgent to tell you, sir. Come in. He'll squeal on us! What if he finds out we tried to kill her? He'll kill us all. -What do you want? -This isn't the place. Your men mustn't hear us. Let's leave. -Going somewhere? -It's nothing. Don't worry. What are you saying? I've no choice but to give her up, right? -So? -You know what I need. You think you can scare me? You want to find her, don't you? You'll lose face if your men find out. I'll do what you want. Take me to her. Boss. Go back on your word and I squeal. This woman? Yeah, she's at my place waiting for you. -Gosh... -You know her? -It really was a misunderstanding. -What misunderstanding? -Nothing. -Where did you get this? A friend. He was searching for her. -What? Can I meet him? -Why? What's going on? What's wrong? Later. Let's meet your friend first. I need to talk to you outside. She's brought a thug with her. Where did you get this? Don't know. What's with all of you? Stop it! He's my brother! He wants to know who's looking for her. Really? Have a seat. Hey! Get out. I've nothing to say to you. I'm not asking you to come back. And I'm not going to punish you two. I just wanted to take you to the place where we first met. Just someone I used to know. I almost got dumped thanks to her. What's burning? He set himself on fire. I don't deserve to love anyone, or be loved by anyone. Forgive me. I took the money in the cabinet. A thief! This is how she repays you for fixing her face? Wait! Weren't her scars on her right cheek? -How do you know? -I've seen her before! Where? She came to the bar. -Where is it? -Jongno. Jongno? Let's go. I never learned how to love, but I did like you. Even now... You may have been cold-blooded, but to me you were warm. Still I punished you. Whatever the excuse, I was a sinner. I didn't blame you. But I curse you for choosing the path of evil. I didn't choose evil. Evil chose me. But you chose to sow its seeds. So I'm gonna reap the seeds I sowed. I must punish you and that cabbie. He's done nothing wrong! Neither have you. The only sinner is me. For the sin of failing to forget you, I must punish myself. I broke the evil rules I myself made. What are you planning? You're scaring me. I started this terror, so I'm finishing it. Before the evil seeds I sowed spawn new seeds... You're sacrificing yourself for my sake? No. Honey. Haven't heard that in a long time. I don't deserve to stand by you now, but I want to help. You were staggering under all that evil, and I tried so hard to hold you up. Though I failed... You didn't fail. Your labor of love didn't fail. You can now live a free woman, free from threats. Stay here with me tonight, till the sun sets again tomorrow. You're acting strange. It's scary. Can't you just run away? Shut up! I can't be an exception. I was merciless with those who broke my rules, Even you. How can I slink away now? Will you stay with me till sunset tomorrow? -Cold? -Warm. The deed to the house. I did as you ordered, Master. You did well. If you wish, I will serve her. Master must now face God's judgment. May God have mercy on him. Understood. What would you like? -I want that girl. -Okay. And to drink? Something strong. Number 70! Call for you! Oh? Excuse me. -Nervous? -That's enough. Go. -Excuse me. -Sit down! I won't be long. -Waiter! -Yes? -Come here! -You called? What's this? She left! Our girls are busy tonight. Busy? Sit down, you prick! -I want my money back! -Don't push it! -My money, you jerk! -Watch your mouth! -You little... -Hey! -Let go! -Where's my money! -I said let go! -My money! Get rid of him. -Now what? -Hush. Keep drinking. Why are you sniffing around? I've seen your mug before. Forgot already? The railroad... You! Where's the woman? That's what I'm here to find out. Talk first. Bring him over. Sorry for killing one of your boys. Didn't mean to. -Why you little... -Hey! If we kill you now, our friend will rest in peace. If I'm not back in ten, the cops'll come. Shut your trap! You think I won't report you? You can't report me for manslaughter. And you can't kill me here. So let's get down to business. Hand over the woman. Now! You know the junkie she lives with? Yeah, but I couldn't find him. Ten minutes are up. Take me to your boss. We're looking for him ourselves. Then I'll leave now unless you want the cops here. Let him go. If he talks to the boss, we're done for. Let's kill him. I think the boss is with her now. Mustn't jump the gun. We know what you're up to, so don't lie to us. I called this meeting to confess. I broke the terrible rules I myself made. I'll reap the seeds of terror I've sown. Never thought a woman would be my downfall. But I've no regrets. I've learned a loveless life's worth less than death. I loved my wife. Still do, always will. My last request. If you have any loyalty left for your old boss, don't harass my wife ever again. When I'm gone, leave if you want. Those who want to stay can have this outfit. No! We can't punish you, boss! We wouldn't be here if not for the boss! Don't you remember? -Think about it! -Shut up! Boss, give the order. No more rules from now on. I order you... ...to punish me. The rules allow the sinner to choose. I choose the knife. -They're fighting among themselves. -Punishing the boss. Now it's your turn. And mine. I can't hurt a fallen man. Where's the woman? -You the cabbie? -That I am. -You know who I am? -That I do. Man enough to fight me for her? -Hand her over unless you want to die. -Get out of here. -Stop wasting my time. -She's back at your place. She said she loves you. To make up for the bad I did her, I took her back to you. Trust me. Even I have a conscience. I trust you. Turn yourself in. Die! I refuse to die before you... -Who was it? -Her lover. Since I can't turn myself in, you call the cops. Tell them we all deserved to die anyway. And tell her I really cared about her. Arrogant bastard. Don¡¯t you dare pity me in my final hour. My death's no call for pity. I chose evil. Not even a bit of affection to mourn my death. In my final moments, I feel terrible loneliness for the first time. So this is how I die. Without a single flower to mark my grave. All mortals speak the truth in the face of death. Like an innocent child. Let's not curse this child's death. He swore his undying love for you as he died. Mourned his lonely soul as he died. You are not alone. My love for you will comfort your lonely soul. I'll mourn your death as the woman who loved you. The End
