Muthi camp. Muthi camp, next stop! Professor sahib, your stop. The refugee camp. Sorry. There you go. Don't drop it. -You have a package? -Yes. For whom? Shiv Kumar Dhar. Congratulations, Teacher-ji. What's all the fuss about? Teacher-ji, you've proved, step-by-step, we can even climb Mt. Everest. You've been writing letters every week for 28 years and I've been sending them. Never mind all that. Show him the letter. Yes, of course. The President of America has invited you to Agra. They've booked the presidential suite for you in a 5-star hotel. Congratulations, Teacher-ji. How are you planning to go, love? By plane or train? What do you mean? You're coming, too. By plane. Really? You'll take me with you? Please sit, everyone. But what will I wear? My favorite color. -Isn't it beautiful? -Very nice. Thank you, Dhar sahib. Dr Shiv Kumar Dhar. My wife, Shanti Dhar. He's the President's guest. This way, sir. The car's waiting. Welcome, sir. Welcome, ma'am. This way, please. -Thank you. -This way, please. Welcome to the presidential suite, sir. Living room with your DVD collection. What a room! Master bedroom. With your bar and some champagne. And that, ma'am, is your private pool. Pool? Only the President must have a room like this in the White House. Consider this your White House for the day, my love. Sir? And this is your bathroom, sir. If you need anything, please let me know. Thank you. Shiv, this bathroom is bigger than our entire house! -It's so beautiful. -Yes, beautiful. What must it cost? At least 6000 rupees. More likely 100,000. Oh, my God! Shiv, look! Our names are on TV. I'll show you something even better. Look at this. -"Love in Kashmir"? -Remember? "I want more love." I remember it all. Scene 20, shot four, take one. Cut! Cut! I need more love. Give me a nice Kashmiri couple in the background. Quick! Madam, we need you for one shot. -Me? -Yes, please come. Sir, you too. Only one shot. Sir, you need to stroll across and talk. -What should I talk about? -It doesn't matter. But act like lovers. Ready, sir. Hello. Ready, sir. Going for a take. -Take two. -Music! Cut! Cut! Hey, Romeo and Juliet! Why so far apart? Closer. Hand-in-hand. Okay? Yes, sir. Don't let go of her hand. It's "Love in Kashmir"! Excuse me! Don't hold my hand. He said, "Hand-in-hand." So what? Don't touch me. Music! Cut! Magazine change. You guys keep holding hands. I want more love! It's "Love in Kashmir"! Let go of my hand. You're reading "Shikara - Love Poems". But you disregard love itself. The verse on page four is beautiful. "Entwined together, you and I Never to be parted, you and I "Through searing sunrays Through stormy dark days "Walking the path of love..." Have you read this book? Well, no one has. It barely sold five copies. How do you know the poem then? Because I wrote it. -You? -Yes, yours truly. Shiv Kumar Dhar. And you are? Shanti. -Shanti? -Shanti Sapru. Shanti Sapru. You have great taste in poetry. What else have you read? We're ready, sir. Music! Scene 20. Shot four. Take three. Cut! Cut! Where did the Kashmiri couple vanish? Get them back. Where are you going? Stop! Where are you going? Come back! Sir, they've gone. Get me another Kashmiri couple. It's "Love in Kashmir"! 92! Well played! Well played, Lateef! Lateef! Your friend is here, says it's urgent. Shiv, what happened? All okay? Listen to this verse. "Dreams of you consume me Day and night "Like spring surrounding me, Never leaving my sight -"As time..." -Are you nuts? You pulled me out at 92 runs for a poem? -I want you to give it to someone. -To whom? My future bride. Would she marry someone else if I'd scored eight more runs? You hit a century every week. This is my only chance. -Where to? -Kashmir Nursing Home. She's a nurse. -Is she pretty? -Worth missing a century for. Then he caught my hand and didn't let it go. Why didn't you pull it free? How could I? He's my favourite poet. -Come early, you two. -Yes, Sheila-ji. Excuse me, are you both nurses here? Yes. -And you are? Shanti? -Yes. Shiv Kumar Dhar has sent this poem for you. -Who are you? -Lateef Lone. Childhood friend, philosopher and guide. "You make my eyes starry "Please don't tarry... Let's just marry." He wrote this? Not exactly. They are his feelings, but my words. I lost the note he gave me. I'll come back with the note. -Don't bother. -Why not? Tell him it's improper to send love letters. Please listen. Hear me out. The proper thing to do is to meet my father. Dinanath Sapru from Ladripura. Congratulations, my friend! I hear wedding bells! Thank you, Almighty, for the spring blossoms are upon us Thank you, Almighty, for granting this love to us My love, I yearn to see you O for a glimpse of your radiance My love, I yearn to see you O for a glimpse of your radiance The long wait is ending! O for a glimpse of your radiance The angels sing in praise of the bride's ethereal beauty The Almighty's benevolence has rained from the heavens -Get ready to pose. -I'm ready. Shall we start with a family photograph? One second, cousin Naveen. Lateef! Abba, please join in. Take the family photograph first, son. It's incomplete without you, Abba. -Say "Cheese!" -Cheese. Why say "cheese"? Never mind the "cheese". Just smile. Naveen bhai, one with you. Lateef, click one please. Be careful with it. Naveen bhai is my hero. He studied medicine in London but chose to open a clinic here in Kashmir. Look. His London school Dean gifted this coat to him. Naveen was his best student. Get your Ph.D and I'll gift you this coat. Because you're my best student! I love you. -Love you! -And all the best to you. Thank you. Lateef, what's going on here? It's my cousin's wedding. Take his pictures. -He's married now. Focus on me. -As you wish, lover boy. You're no help. Shanti, please put in a word to your friend. I represent Kashmir in cricket. Last week I scored 171 against Delhi. -Please tell her. -I'll call her. Wait. Aarti! You know Lateef. He scored 171 against Delhi in his first innings. Really? And in your second innings? Zero? Did you read it in the papers? No, I read it on your face. -Naveen, please take a photo of us. -With pleasure. Okay. Everyone ready? Smile! Look at you! -The Lal Ded School Gang? -Lateef's father... Abba's school. I owe everything to his teaching. Lateef is completely smitten. He's fallen head over heels for my friend. He said, "Wait a few days. We'll go on our honeymoon together." So, where should I take you for our honeymoon? If you can, take me to the Taj Mahal someday. Only if you can. Aarti warned me, Lateef has hidden eight alarm clocks set to go off every eight minutes. To remind you of the eight runs you didn't let him score. A Lateef-special for our wedding night. Let's go. Before another alarm goes off. Where to? On our honeymoon. Taj Mahal? Just like death your absence would be Just like death is time apart Just like the lonesome river finding her sea Finding you is finding me Just like death your absence would be Just like fragments of a former self, unless in you I discover myself Just like a stranger to myself, unless your arms entwine me Just like a rapidly-sinking mirage Only to shimmer in your presence Just like a vessel lost at sea Yet so securely anchored in me Just like death your absence would feel Just like an unspoken tongue All words seem alien to me Only silence can whisper my heart's desires Just like petals at dawn Your eyes sparkle in the mist Just like a stargazer combing the sky I search for that gaze Just like dewdrops shining at daybreak To fade away as the day begins Let me shine and fade away It's with you my life begins Just like death your absence would be Just like death is time apart Just like the lonesome river finding her sea Just like the lonesome river finding her sea Finding you is finding me The bricks are here. We need stones now. Once our house is ready, come for apples every day. The apples from your tree are delicious. We bought this land because of the apple tree. -Why don't you invite her? -Who? Aarti? -Let her enjoy the apples, too. -You like Aarti, don't you? -What's this? -Read it and show it to her. "Lateef Lone hits Hurricane Hundred." Scored 107! -Abba's election truck here? -A surprise, my friend. Come. Rashid, unload the stones. -Salaam, Abba. -Salaam. How are you, son? -I'm fine, Abba. What's this? -This? For your home. A strong foundation of stone. They've been unused for three years. Abba stopped work on our house and donated all his money for political work. Abba, please come up. Son, put your heart and soul into building this house. You make a home once in a lifetime. Hey Shanti, time to celebrate. Happy wedding anniversary! -Congratulations! -Thank you. Looks like the house is almost done. Shikara. -What a beautiful name! -I thought of it. Shall I tell you why? On our wedding night, Shiv and I... We... I... I wrote her a poem on a flower boat titled "Shikara". That's why... "Shikara". Can I hear the poem? Let's hear it. -Well... -Recite it now. Here's your wedding anniversary gift. Thank you. What is it? It's a compact typewriter, aunt. For Shiv to type his Ph.D thesis. You always look out for him, Naveen. -See, he's already begun his thesis. -Read it. "Shanti named the house 'Shikara' because we made love in..." Why stop? Keep reading. Let them hear it. Doctor sahib! Hurry! We must rush to your clinic. What happened, Rashid? Whose blood is on your shirt? We were holding an election rally. The police attacked us. They hit us with rifle butts. They cracked open Abba's head. Lateef is hysterical. Save him, doctor sahib! You call this a democracy? We were holding a peaceful rally. And the government imposed Section 144. I can bet they'll play dirty in the upcoming elections. Make way. Let Doctor sahib through. Move... make way. Elections are meaningless in Kashmir. War is the answer! He's lost a lot of blood, sir. He needs a transfusion at once. Khurshid sahib... Abba. Shiv. We'll have to move him to the city hospital. Head injuries can be complicated. Take my bike. Go! Make the arrangements there. I'll call for an ambulance. -Take care of Lateef. -I'm calling Dr Wani. News just in... Party leader Khurshid Lone injured. Riot police charges into the crowd in downtown Srinagar. Party Chief Javed Mir spoke to us. Khurshid sahib only asked that the promise of plebiscite be honored. The promise the Indian Prime Minister Nehru made to the people of Kashmir. We only demand our right to self-determination. I ask the Indian government, is it right to suppress us? Protests rang across Kashmir. Anti-India slogans were also raised. Dr Wani is waiting. How much longer? The ambulance left a while ago. It'll be here any minute. You've left this blank... "Relationship to the patient." You can write "son". Such attacks will not deter us. India, beware! We will not... Sir, he's here! I couldn't save him, Shiv. He died in the ambulance. Too much blood loss. Lateef? Lateef drove off in the ambulance. Where to? I don't know. He said, "The government has killed Abba. "His burial procession will not leave from a government hospital." And he just took off. O Allah, I trust in You. You are my only hope Lead me on the path of righteousness How long must I bear ignorance? O Almighty, shower me with Your wisdom How are you, Rehman? What are these wooden planks for? Dhar sahib is making a bookshelf. What's so funny, Rehman? My boss, Haji sahib, can barely read. These planks are fine for books. But I suggest stronger shelves. Haji sahib will want to store milk cans on them. Why would he store his milk cans in our home? Don't you get it? You'll have to leave... for India. Haji sahib says, once you leave Kashmir, this house will be his. You're totally mad! Abdul Hamid. Ashraf Shah. -Ramesh Raina. -Present, sir! -Gul Mohammed. -Present, sir! Mustafa Khaleel. -Bansi Kaul. -Yes, sir! Ehsaan Mallik. Salim Qureshi. These students have been missing class for weeks. Does anyone know their whereabouts? Anybody? Salaam, sir! Salaam, sir. Salim Qureshi, where were you? -Why haven't you attended class?-Professor sahib. Please. Professor sahib, get in, please. Sorry, Professor sahib. -Rashid. -Salaam! How are you? Sit down. Look, Shiv. I couldn't save my father. You must save yours. Leave for India. Now. What are you saying? My home... is here. Sell it now. You won't be able to sell it later. You've put your life-savings into it. Sell it quickly and get out. Fine. I'll sell it to you then. It's built on the stones your father gifted to me. How will you price those stones? Lateef... you remember those stones? Yes. I used similar stones... for my father's grave. How will your India price those stones? Get out of here. Kashmir is ours. Listen, Lateef... You're on a dangerous path. Rashid. Drop him back. It was my duty to warn you. If I hadn't, I'd feel guilty for life. May Allah protect you. Listen to me. I'll come back. Lateef. Don't come back. And not a word about this place. We shoot Indian informers on sight. Didn't Lateef go to Pakistan? Yes. Why? I thought I saw him in that van. Many young men have been crossing the border. I hear there are direct buses from Lal Chowk to Pakistan. They cry out brazenly, "Pindi, Pindi, Rawalpindi." Dal Gate, Dal Gate. Let's go, Aarti. Dal Gate, Dal Gate. -Bye, Sheila-ji. -Bye, Shanti. Bye, Aarti. Hurry up, my child! Wear a hijaab. Didn't you read our diktat in the papers? Women must wear the hijaab. Batmaloo, Batmaloo. Pindi, Pindi, Rawalpindi. Pindi, Pindi, Rawalpindi? Going to Pakistan? Stop the bus, scumbag! An attack at the Srinagar bus-stop this afternoon resulted in the death of four policemen. The Home Minister assured us the situation would soon be under control. That's it? Half-a-minute news? At a conference in Malta, America and Russia announced an official end to the Cold War. Following a meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, US President George Bush has said there will be peace in the world. Look who's talking about peace? First America sends guns to Afghanistan to kill Russians. And now those guns have found their way here to kill us. What peace are these arms-dealers talking about? President Bush should be told of the havoc his weapons are causing in Kashmir. Seriously. Shiv, why don't you write to the American President? Write to him. -Why would he read my letter? -Why not? -He's the President of America. -You keep writing till he responds. Write on your new typewriter in your finest English. Okay? Is Shanti alright? She's fine. Her blood pressure is better than mine. Dhar sahib! Pandit-ji! Listen to me, Dhar sahib. Go back to sleep. I'll go. Please come, Pandit-ji. Dhar Sahib! Anybody home? Why are you shouting so early in the morning? There's a hit-list out of Kashmiri Hindu Pandits. Hurry! You have to leave immediately... for India. -What? -Come with me. You must buy your tickets for India right away. India? What's this, Masood sahib? Son, it's a hit-list with the names of Kashmiri Pandits. "Pandits, leave Kashmir within one month or you'll be shot dead." Oh Allah! Even Kaul sahib is on the list. Where's my name? It's in Urdu... Manoharlal Kaul. It's just some boys up to mischief. Empty threats to scare off government officials. Kaul sahib, don't worry. You're safe here. My son, Zakir, will stay at your place. Masood sahib, we're one people. Some scoundrels are creating trouble between our communities. No need to worry, Raina sahib. If these scoundrels believe we don't fear them, they'll back off. Don't worry. I know Police Chief Mr Baig very well. If there's any problem, I'll call him. Nothing will happen to Kashmiri Pandits. If they kill Kaul sahib, who will read the news on TV? Shiv! Shiv, the "rogan-josh" is ready. What are you writing, Mr Poet? My only treasure... is the secret of your smile Seeing my misery you cast your suffering away You shield me from thunder when my skies turn grey Seeing you light my darkness I fall in love all over again Having nothing means nothing to me It's you... Who is everything to me? Shiv. Look! Shiv, isn't that the Pandit neighborhood? Whose house is on fire? Oh God, they're burning Raina sahib's house! The phone's dead. Shiv! Don't go out now, please. I'm going to Haji sahib's shop. He knows the Police Chief Baig. I'll be right back. Haji sahib! You know Chief Baig well, right? Tell him to send the police immediately. They're burning Hindu Pandit homes. The line's dead. Damn these phones! Rehman, check the connection. -Just a second. -Is the wire loose? Shanti is at home alone. I must hurry back. Don't worry, I'll call the Police Chief. We'll shoot if you shout. We want our freedom! Shanti! What are you doing? Shiv, our apple tree is on fire! They'll burn our house down. I've called the police. It'll be alright. Shiv! Hush... Shanti, hush! Scoundrels! Why are you here? Out of here! Get out of here! No one touches this house. Get out! Out of here. Out! Stay clear of this house. Kashmir is ours, not yours to devour! You infidels! Leave our Kashmir! Shiv! Shiv! I thought I'd die without seeing you. The village was set on fire. So many killed. We would've been killed too, if it weren't for Lateef. He saved us. He gave me this note for you. I couldn't save my father, Shiv. But you can save yours. Take him to India. Allah be with you! If Indian leaders go to Kashmir, will the Kashmiris welcome them? Impossible! Brave Kashmiris do not fear death because they are Muslim. Kashmiris have Mujahideen blood in their veins. Kashmiris will fight this jihad till the last drop of their blood! Kashmiris are protectors of the Islamic Shariah given by Allah. They are descendants of Hazrat Ali and Hazrat Omar. Brave Kashmiri women, followers of Bibi Khadija, will not rest... It's dirty politics. Now they're using religion to incite people. This fire of hatred is going to get out of control. Kashmir is going to burn, Shiv. We have to get out of here for a while. Go through here. Where are you off to? Pick the tickets up. I'll be right back. There's tension in the air. Don't go alone. The dry cleaners are open, let me collect my coat. I'll need it in Delhi. -Let me come with you. -Make sure to get me a window seat. Namaste. I was waiting for you before I closed. Where did Naveen go? Round the corner. To the dry cleaners. Your tickets are ready. Naveen Zutshi... one window seat, direct to Delhi. And these five tickets are for your family. Delhi via Agra. Have you told Shanti-ji about the Taj Mahal? -It's a surprise. -Surprise? -Was Naveen Zutshi here? -He took his coat and left. Run! There's trouble. Naveen bhai! Open your eyes. Naveen bhai! Open your eyes. Can you hear me? -Take him to the hospital. -Yes, sir. Quick. Hurry! Did you see who shot him? Sir, this Kashmiri Pandit is dead. The situation in Kashmir is volatile. On the night of January 19th, people took to the streets in Kashmir. Some militants set fire to thousands of Pandit homes. There were demonstrations across the valley. Slogans were directed at Kashmiri Pandits. Here's our report. We'll shoot if you shout. We want our freedom! You infidels! Leave our Kashmir! We'll write our freedom with your blood! A report just came in... our news anchor Manoharlal Kaul has been shot dead. Pandits holding important positions have been singularly targeted. Amongst them is television chief L. Kaul PK Razdan from Gao Kadal, famous poet Sarvanand Premi, PN Handoo, Assistant Director of the Information Department... Shiv, pack your bags. You must leave immediately. Kaul sahib has been shot dead. We managed to get Raina sahib safely out of Kashmir. My son Zakir has a taxi waiting for you. It'll take you to Jammu. Leave now. Zakir, take care of Shiv. Shiv, hurry. Shanti, my child. Pack the essentials only. Come on. Please. Hurry. Leave now. Zakir, take them safely. Shanti, hurry up. You have to leave now. Shanti, there's no time. Pandit-ji! We're homeless, penniless. We have nowhere to go. Where are you taking this calf? I left her behind in my village. She broke the rope and followed us. -What could I do? -Let me tell you. I advise you to leave her here. At least she'll have grass to eat in Kashmir. Let me get out. Just a minute. Hang on. Careful. Easy... Dhar sahib! Thank God you've managed to escape from Kashmir. But where have we landed? In hell. We've woken into a nightmare. Don't worry, Dhar sahib. Over 400,000 Kashmiri Pandits have been made homeless. There'll be an uproar in Parliament. Protests will echo across the country. The government will be forced to take swift action and send us back home. This situation is only temporary. We'll be back home in a few weeks. Shanti, what's wrong? Shiv. Aarti... They've killed Aarti! I want to go back to my motherland. Anyone going to Kashmir? Take me back to my Kashmir. Anyone going to Kashmir? I want to go back... Would you please shut up? We'll send you back. Quiet now! Next. Show me that. Shiv Kumar Dhar. You're supposed to be a family of five. -Where are the others? -Sitting in the shade. Get them here. How do I know they exist? Show some respect. Are you doing us a favour? We have a beautiful home back in Kashmir. Why come running here then? You should've shown your bravado in Kashmir. He's a teacher. Let it be. Please sign here. Next. Move on. Take me back home. Back to my home in Kashmir. Back to my home on the banks of the river Jhelum. Please someone, take me back to my valley. The Jammu Nationalist Party is happy to gift to all our displaced brothers and sisters... tomatoes. Our Party stands by our Hindu brothers. Remember the Jammu Nationalist Party. Come one, come all! Have you seen Shiv? He's gone back to Kashmir. Gone back home. He didn't take me with him. Will you, please? Shiv. What's this? "Dear Mr President "I am writing this letter to fulfil a dead man's wish "wearing clothes stained with his blood. "My brother Naveen was shot "by American guns you sent to Afghanistan. "Your guns have rendered a proud community homeless "and begging for tomatoes." Naveen bhai asked me to write to the President. Here it is. I'm aware no one's going to read it. But I won't stop. "Mr Bush, you owe us..." Shiv. "Entwined together, you and I "Never to be parted, you and I "Through searing sunrays "Through stormy dark days "Walking the path of love We'll touch the horizon as one. "Never to be parted, you and I "Entwined together, you and I" What a terrible poem! Who's the poet? Dear Mr President It has been 31 months and 12 days since my first letter. This is my 124th letter, I will keep writing till you respond. I owe it to my dead brother and the whole Pandit community... Congratulations! Congratulations, Doctor sahib! A gift for you. You've earned your Ph.D! You're no longer just a teacher. You're a doctor now. Dr Shiv Kumar Dhar! "This is a congratulatory note and intimation letter "to inform you that the thesis work submitted by you on the topic "Influence of Lal Ded in Kashmiri Culture "under the guidance of Tafazzul Hussain Khan "has been approved by the University." I'll get you out of this hellhole, Shanti. I'll get a job as professor at Punjab University. We'll tear down the mosque! We'll build our temple in its place! -We'll tear down the mosque! -Hey, Mr Leader! We'll build our temple in its place! Hush. -Aren't you Lalit Ladru? -Yes. From now on everybody must call him Leader Ladru. -What'll you call him? -Leader Ladru. Mr Leader Ladru. A leader's job is to unite people, not to divide them. -Understand? -Yes, Teacher-ji. -Everybody? -Yes! Good! I'll explain further in class. Off to school. Run along! Tell me who will teach these kids if their only teacher leaves the refugee camp? The school will close down. You'll have a bungalow, Shanti. You'll be happy. And what about these kids? We'll stay here, Shiv. You're all I need. A bungalow doesn't matter to me. You are my home. My only virtue... is my love for you My only wealth... is your love for me With your quiet strength Your hand in mine I'm never alone With your everlasting love You make me whole With a single smile You complete my home Mr Leader Ladru. Are these lines close or far? Close! Now, all of you. Are these lines close or far? Far! Like these lines, all of us can unknowingly drift apart. If this carries on, one day India... Salaam! Are you Shiv Kumar Dhar from Chanpora? -Yes. What can I do for you? -Five minutes of your time, please. Ladru, please take over the class. Boys and girls, look at these lines... Yes? I'm Mohammed Shafi. I run a dry fruit business in Srinagar. How can I help? Pandit-ji, allow us the privilege of helping you by offering you a very good price for your house. My blood and sweat have gone into building my home. What price will you put on it? I'm not interested. But there's nothing left for you in Kashmir. Even the taps and tiles have been stolen from your house. Most of the Pandits have left. Why not sell your village house as well? We'll better the price. No, thank you. 400,000 for the new Chanpora house, 50,000 for the village home. Total 450,000 rupees. -No, thank you. -I forgot. A small gift for your wife. She can use this Kashmiri saffron for your kahwa-tea. Where did you get this coat? I bought it in Delhi. We have business there as well. Give it to him. I think you like this coat. Here. Keep it, Pandit-ji. Please call me anytime and we'll come with your money. Salaam. "Thesis work submitted by you on the topic "'Influence of Lal Ded in Kashmiri Culture', "done under the guidance of Tafazzul Hussain Khan "has been approved by the University. "With great delight..." Shiv! Naveen bhai had promised, "Get your Ph.D and I'll gift you my coat." See. He kept his promise. This is Naveen bhai's coat. Shiv, calm down. I think of you every moment, O my beloved motherland I long to be with you, O my beloved motherland A million shards of glass pierce me Shattered is this orphaned heart Please come, Teacher-ji. Here's your receipt for the registered mail to America. Hello! -Shafi Mohammad?-Yes. Who's that? Dhar sahib! It's you. Salaam. Happy to hear from you. I'll be there tomorrow with 450,000 rupees. Forget 450,000! I won't sell my home to you for 45 million. It's time you stop dreaming of our homes. If you didn't want to sell, you should've told me. And you took my coat. You Pandits have no shame. It's you who should be ashamed! This coat was never yours. This coat belongs to my cousin who was shot before my eyes. You stole it off a dead man. No, Teacher-ji. -I won't charge you anymore. -Mohanlal-ji. Please. Shanti-ji, what work do I do? I sell tobacco. While Teacher-ji has dedicated his life to teaching our kids. It's the least I can do. Thank you. Let's go. Teacher-ji, throw the ball. Come, play cricket with us. Sorry, Leader Ladru-ji, I'm a dud at cricket. But, if my friend were here, he would've hit it out of the park. I haven't heard you mention Lateef for years. But I miss him every single day. Dear Mr Obama Congratulations on winning the presidential elections! I wrote to Mr George Bush Sr, then to Mr Bill Clinton, Mr George Bush Jr and now I'm writing to you. It has been 18 years since I am living in a refugee camp in my own country. In these 18 years I have not been able to go back even once. Not even to immerse the ashes of my dead parents. You infidels! Leave our Kashmir! We'll write our freedom with your blood! Freedom, freedom! Shiv, the "rogan-josh" is ready. Just a minute. Must you give Mr President only bad news? Give him some good news, too. Tell him instead of temporary tents we have permanent quarters now. -8 x 8ft. -Yes, but with solid brick walls. And in that solid quarter my wife has made my favourite dish, "rogan-josh". Which she's going to serve on our dining table. Therefore, Mr President, I'll stop writing to dine with my wife. Let's eat. Shanti-ji. Teacher-ji, some army soldiers are looking for you. -Army? -Yes. Please come, sir. Yes? Are you Dr Shiv Kumar Dhar? Yes, I am. I'm Captain Rathod. You'll have to accompany us to Kashmir. Right away. Kashmir? O my beloved, my motherland So near, yet so far. Tell me how you are Do children still sail the shikara carefree? And unwind under a Chinar tree? Does winter still freeze the mountainside lakes? Do autumn leaves dance upon snowflakes? O my beloved, my motherland So near, yet so far. Tell me how you are Does spring still find you turning luscious green? And summer noons find you resting serene? Does everything your sun touches still turn to gold? Does the moon caress the snow on summits age old? O my beloved, my motherland. What shall I say about myself? Every moment is a torment without you Every breath is suffocating death One day I'll come back to you And share all I've endured Till that day no joy, no smile O motherland, for your Pandit son in exile Sir, we've entered Alpha Base-1. Mr and Mrs Dhar are with me. Okay. Should I bring them upstairs, sir? Ask Mrs Dhar to wait in the car. Right, sir. I'll escort him upstairs. Okay, sir. Thanks for coming. Ma'am, please wait. It's okay. I'm Colonel Bhattacharya. He said he'd talk only to you. Get as much information as you can. This way. He's inside. Shiv. Lateef. I know why they've summoned you. They're hoping to get information from our talk. Lateef, I'm here to see you. -I have nothing to do with them. -I know. But they're listening in. Colonel sahib, you brought my friend to me. Now here's what you want to know. My father was brutally murdered 21 years ago. In retaliation, I've killed many of your men and you, mine. And this deathly cycle will carry on for twenty-one, hundred or even a thousand years. This bloodshed will never end. Arms-dealers will keep selling us guns to mint money. Politicians will keep using our bloodshed to win elections. Shiv, the main reason I called you here... Tell Shanti, before dying, Lateef said sorry for Aarti's death. Aarti? I went to kill District Officer Kachru on the night of 21st January. I had no idea there were other Pandits hiding in his house. We killed them all. Tell Shanti, before I die I want to... Don't talk about dying, Lateef. You'll be fine! You'll see. You'll soon be playing cricket for Jammu and Kashmir. Those eight runs I missed. I'll hit a century! Inshallah. He was your best friend. I'm sure he'll open up more tomorrow. Please don't tell my wife about Lateef killing Aarti. -I understand. -Thank you. Shiv. What did Lateef say? He said, "You're lucky, Shiv. "You have Shanti's love." Liar. He said he'll play cricket again. Hit that century. Sir, where's your house? -Chanpora. -This is Chanpora, sir. Really? Everything's changed. -Can we come in, Haji sahib? -Please do. -We've come to see our home. -Of course. This is your home. We're just looking after it. Sure. Just taking care. Isn't that why you stopped your boys from burning it down? Since you're here, shall we discuss a price for the house? We'll never sell our home to you. You can carry on looking after our home for a bit longer. It pains me to tell you it's impossible for you to return to Kashmir. The situation here has become much worse. Remember your milkman Rehman? He was killed by the army and Masood sahib was shot dead by the militants. It's in your best interest to sell me the house. Money can help you make a home anywhere. We'll return home one day. This is where we belong. We'll live and die here. Our ashes will finally rest in Kashmir. Are you okay? I'm absolutely fine. -Captain, come in. -Sir! Have they reached the guesthouse? We're on our way, sir. They won't need to come tomorrow. The militant is dead. Right, sir. Dear Mr President Over the years, I have seen the world turn into a graveyard. I write these letters to you for my own sanity knowing fully well that there will be no response. According to the United Nations there are 68.5 million forcibly displaced people in the world today. -Shiv, how am I looking? -Just a moment. Please turn around. Look at me. Afghanistan, Iraq... -Where are you going? -To Mohanlal-ji's daughter's wedding. Isn't that later tonight? I wanted you to see how I look in the daylight. What do you think? You look as beautiful as you did 30 years ago. So give Mr President this good news. Tell him my wife is looking beautiful, all dressed for a Kashmiri wedding. My hips swing when you give me a wink Pretty lady, when you ignore me my heart sinks Keep on dancing Don't stop romancing Your luscious lips are a hit, they beckon me every minute My hips thrust to the beat I've opened the gates to my heart Hello! Miss Beauty, come be a part Scream and shout, work that pout Baby, burn the dance floor. Give us more, give us more! You kill me with one look. Don't need a knife Follow me, pretty lady, I'll take you for my wife Thank you, Almighty for the spring blossoms are upon us Thank you, Almighty for granting this love to us O for a glimpse of your radiance The long wait is ending! Shanti! What's wrong? Are you okay? Water? How are you? I'm absolutely fine, Doctor sahib. Do you recognize him? It's our Leader Ladru! He's a brain specialist now. I remember him as a young boy in shorts. How could I recognize him all grown up? Don't worry, ma'am. You'll be fine. Why do I need to worry with Leader Ladru in charge? Teacher-ji. She's critical. I'll speak to the top neurosurgeon in Delhi. We'll get a date for the surgery within a week. Don't worry about the expense. I'll take care of it. You don't have to worry about the cost. Sir, I am where I am because of you. This is the least I can do. Please allow me. Tell me frankly, what are her chances? It's been a lifetime. How quickly time has passed. Room service. Good afternoon, sir. This is for you. Thank you. I'll take it from here. Okay, sir. What's that? What has Mr President sent? Happy 30th anniversary, Shanti! Is today the 5th of September? Yes, you forgot our wedding anniversary. -I did, completely! -No problem. Come. Slowly. The President has sent us such a beautiful cake. He has such respect for you. And you've been writing rebuking letters to him. Please don't show attitude when you meet him. Shiv, who told him about our anniversary? Did you? You really think the President of America has arranged all this? What do you mean? Come, sit with me. Careful, my love. Remember the clerk... at our Relief Commissioner's office? -Radheshyam. -Yes, why? Even he doesn't have time for us, makes us wait for hours. You think the President of America will have time for us? You're confusing me. The truth is, I'm your "Mr President". Your very own "Teacher-ji". Shiv, but the letter... Mohanlal-ji said... That was the booking confirmation for this presidential suite. I booked it for you. Mohanlal-ji read "presidential suite" and assumed it was from the President. He never imagined that I'd have 100,000 rupees to book this suite. How do you have 100,000 rupees, Shiv? I sold the house, Shanti. You sold our "Shikara"? You sold our home for my treatment? You just get well, we'll build a new home. Don't tell me who you sold it to. I didn't sell it to Haji. I sold it to Zakir, Masood sahib's son. Shanti, please... you'll make me cry, too. It's a happy occasion. Our 30th wedding anniversary! I'm happy. I promise you, I'm happy. You're all I need. You are my home, Shiv. Come, let's cut the cake. Light it. There's somewhere I want to take you. Let's go. Go where? On our honeymoon. Taj Mahal? Just like death your absence would be Just like death is time apart Just like the lonesome river finding her sea Finding you is finding me Just like death your absence would be Just like fragments of a former self, unless in you I discover myself Just like a stranger to myself, unless your arms entwine me Just like a rapidly-sinking mirage Only to shimmer in your presence Just like a vessel lost at sea Yet so securely anchored in me Just like death your absence would be Just like... Dear Shanti It was your wish that I show you the Taj Mahal one day. That, too, only if possible. I'm sorry, Shanti. It took me 30 years to fulfil your wish. You had one more wish... to return home to Kashmir and that your ashes would finally rest here. I've fulfilled both your wishes, Shanti. I've brought you back to Kashmir. Back to our ancestral village home... where we got married. We're back where we belong, Shanti. To the room where life started for us. Where Lateef hid eight alarm clocks. We're together again. Entwined together, you and I Never to be parted, you and I Through searing sunrays Through stormy dark days Walking the path of love we'll touch the horizon as one Entwined together, you and I Never to be parted, you and I Now some good news for you. I'll spend all day teaching the children here. And every night, I'll write you a letter. That's 365 letters a year. You don't have to worry about replying. Thanks to various American Presidents I'm used to getting no response. When we meet again I know you'll answer every love letter I've written. Until that day... Yours forever, Shiv. Who's there? Teacher-ji, it's me, Salman. Leader Salman! -And who have you brought with you? -My friend. He's joining your school from tomorrow. Very good. What are you staring at? They've never seen a Kashmiri Pandit before. Don't tell him. -Happy now you've seen one? -Yes. Off you go! Let's go. Come on.
